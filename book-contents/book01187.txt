Dear Jim, 

A recent Galaxy Forum piece by Fred Pohl showed how a set of problems can be 
made to solve each other. 1 think I've found another of those snake-balls that will 
proceed to untangle themselves once we’ve taken the first steps — and since my let- 
ter on tuna fishing and dolphins elicited such an intense response, I thought you 
might like to bring this matter to the attention of Galaxy's readership as well. 

The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales; it teaches a maximum 
length of 60 feet, and is the only cetacean (indeed, the only living animal) with a 
throat large enough to admit a man. It is also the source of ambergris. [Also, it is 
not impossible that the sperm whale is as intelligent as homo sapiens. Ed.] Unless 
we do something, the species will be extinct within ten years. 

The sperm whale is in trouble because of its spermaceti organ, a rather mysteri- 
ous thing in its head that carries about a ton of whale oil. No one knows what it 
does for the whale — but we find it quite valuable; the US could use 50 million 
pounds of it per year, or 25 thousand whales’ worth. 

Of course we no longer buy sperm oil. The Marine Mammals Protection Act 
quite rightly forbids importation of all whale-derived products. Good as far as it 
goes, but not enough to save the whales; Japanese and Soviet whalers go right on 
killing, and there’s a ready market for every available drop of sperm oil. 

That’s problem one, then: saving the sperm whale from extinction. 

Problem two: severe unemployment in our Southwestern deserts. 

Dual solution: those same Southwestern deserts, Indian Reservation land, mostly, 
can be made to produce 200 pounds of sperm oil per-acre per-year. 

You see, there’s this scruffy-looking plant called the jojoba (pronounced ho- 
HO-ba) that grows wild in the Sonora and southwards, and the seeds of this shrub 
tum out to be composed of about 50% of an oil nearly identical to that of the 
sperm whale — certainly near enough so for industrial uses. 

A recent Study by the National Research Council shows how planting 400 acres 
in jojoba each year for the next five years will ultimately provide an annual yield of 
a half million pounds of sperm oil indefinitely. The initial cultivation and refining 
will need Federal subsidies — but the major costs will be salaries for people at pre- 
sent unemployed — who will then become taxpayers. 

So. A viable industry in a high-unemployment area, and sufficiency in sperm oil. 
So far so good; but I recommend we go much further. 

Why not plant a lot of jojoba? The cost of subsidizing the cultivation of several 
thousand acres of the -stuff can’t be large compared to the millions of acres of to- 
bacco for which we pay subsidies. Why not grow enough jojoba to sell the oil 
cheap on the world market; so cheap that there’s no profit in killing sperm whales. 

The benefits — alleviating unemployment, sufficiency in sperm oil, and saving a 
species from extinction — seem well worth the cost. Normally I do not recommend 
government subsidies; in this case I’ll swallow my theoretical objections. I’ve writ- 
ten my Congressman about it. Care to join me?

Christopher 

Irwin 



1 ien walked over to the edge of 
the plateau. The grass felt cool and 
damp under her feet, and the orange 
light of the late sun glowed warm 
on her body. It was one of those 
evenings that made her want to 
stretch her arms and dance. 

The shelter she had found for the 
night was good. It looked like the 
remains of an old overseer house, 
one of the many plastic-and- 
concrete skeletons that dotted the 
countryside. No doubt it had once 
been the site of solemn conferences, 
important gatherings, strange mira- 
cles like fires that burned inside 



glass bubbles like tiny stars — things 
that her mother and the minstrels 
used to tell her about when she was 
a child. She looked around at the 
crumbling walls. Someone had ob- 
viously been there before her, most 
of the plastic had been stripped off 
and much of the better stone carried 
away. At her feet she saw faint 
traces of deer tracks; other animals 
had used this crumbling edifice as a 
shelter. 

Suddenly a squirrel appeared on 
one of the pieces of stone that jutted 
above the weeds. Tien looked at it, 
watched the creature’s dark inquisi- 
tive eyes, its nervous, jumpy mo- 
tions. She tried to extend herself to 
the animal, but she picked up no 
thoughts — just a vague feeling of fear 
and hunger. The squirrel was obvi- 
ously an ur-animal, not one of the 
newer ones bred by the Overseers to 
renew the world after the Age of 
Famine and the Great Plague. Hav- 
ing satisfied himself that Tien was 
not a meat-eater, the squirrel began 
to ignore her and poked around for 
food. As it leaped to the ground, 
one of its feet grazed a protuberance 



8 




on an ancient metal box attached to 
one of the ruined walls. 

“GREETINGS TO ANY WHO 
MAY COME UPON THIS, THE 
HOUSE OF OR.” 

Tien looked about, terrified. 

“LET IT BE KNOWN THAT IN 
THIS YEAR TWO AFTER THE 
GREAT . THE GREAT . 
THE GREAT 

The squirrel scampered off into 
the bush. Tien looked all around 
her, but could see no one. The 
voice disappeared as mysteriously 
as it came. Once again there was 
only the ancient silence of the eve- 
ning, the distant cries of birds, the 
clicking and whirring of insects. 

Tien backed away. A few yards 
from the rubble she began to run. 
The long grass on the hillside 
whipped around her ankles, thistles 
scratched her leg, but she kept on 
running and didn’t pause to look 
back. 

She ran on, breathing hard, until 
she reached the deep shadows of a 
cedar grove, an arm of the Great 
Forest. Hidden in the speckled 
gloom beneath countless leaves and 
towering branches, she sat on a 
rock and looked around. Her lungs 
hurt and her feet stung from tiny 
cuts, but she felt safe here. She 
couldn’t always trust that intuition, 
however, so she decided to make 
sure. She closed her eyes and 
opened her mind to any sensation, 
any shadow of a feeling. No, she 
sensed no violence here. Only 
peace. 

EVENING SONG, NIGHT DANCER 



“When life is no longer surpris- 
ing to you,” her grandmother used 
to say, “then you are half-dead.” 
But voices out of nowhere? That 
was a little more than surprising. 
However, her grandmother had 
been wise — the only person she had 
ever known who could make sense 
of the funny little markings in the 
old books of the Overseers. Tidn 
rubbed her ankle. She was begin- 
ning to feel better already. 

It was then that she heard the 
music. At least, it sounded like 
music — very clear and delicate, like 
the sound of glass wind chimes on a 
summer night. 

First voices out of the air, now 
music, she said to herself. 

The sound seemed to come from 
beyond a hedge by an oak tree. She 
approached the hedge cautiously, 
sniffing the air, all senses sharply 
tuned to any trace of blood or 
malice. 

No malice. Just that peculiar 
shimmering music, shifting, chang- 
ing color like a dragonfly’s wing. 
She looked through a cleft in the 
'leaves. 

It was a psio-hippus playing a 
harmonium. Instantly the memory 
of Tien’s old tribe flickered in her 
head. The campfires . the 
music . she knew she had heard 
that kind of music somewhere be- 
fore. She hesitated to go into the 
clearing. On the one hand psio- 
hippi were supposed to be very gen- 
tle animals; the human-like brains 
the Overseers had bred into them 

9 




made them intelligent and 
inquisitive — an ideal combination of 
strength and mental ability. On the 
other hand, this particular one might 
be a strange mutant, a renegade. Of 
course, whatever he was, he might 
have some food. 

She decided to take a chance, and 
parted the branches to step forward. 

The psio-hippus heard the snap of 
twigs and looked around. 

Before him stood a stunning 
young woman with shaggy hair and 
full breasts, her legs long and sleek. 
He smiled. 

“Long life to you,” he greeted. 

“To you too,” she replied polite- 
ly- 

“What’s your name?” he asked, 
setting aside the harmonium. 

“Tien,” she said. “Yours?” 

“Twofour Nine,” he said. 

“Too-fore-nine?” she repeated. 
“That’s a strange name.” 

“That’s what I’ve always been 
called; I’m sorry if you don’t like 
it.” 

“No,” she added, “I like it; I’ve 
just never heard it before.” 

“ ‘Tien’ — that’s Jinese, isn’t it?” 

“Yes,” she said. “I think it 
means ‘field’.” 

“That’s a beautiful dialect,” he 
said. “I learned it from a tribe that 
used to live down by Neverending 
River.” 

“Really?” she smiled. “My an- 
cestors were from that area.” 

“Tell me, Tien,” Twofour con- 
tinued, “what’s a young creature 
like you doing out here alone?” 



“I was going to bed down up on 
the plateau, near the ruins,” she 
said, “but a voice came out of 
nowhere. I was so frightened I ran. 
I don’t know how long I ran. I en- 
ded up here, where I heard your 
music.” 

Twofour nodded; his short mane 
shook gracefully. “I know the 
place,” he said. “There’s a local 
spirit that lives there; I think he 
calls himself ‘Or’. Many people are 
afraid to go there, but I’ve never 
heard of anything happening. I be- 
lieve that this spirit must be a harm- 
less one. Although I know several 
people who claim to have heard him 
speak, I myself have never heard a 
thing there.” 

Tien began to relax. Apparently 
there was nothing to worry about; 
the voice was harmless and 
Twofour seemed gentle and protec- 
tive. 

“How about some angelfood?” 
he offered, extending an arm. 
Twofour’ s strange combination of 
hoofs and Opposing digits surprised 
her, although she didn’t find it unat- 
tractive. 

“Go on,” he said. “I gathered 
them just this morning. I found a 
whole bunch growing together in 
the field down there.” 

She took three of the small mush- 
rooms from his hand, inspected 
their markings, and then popped 
them into her mouth. 

“You haven’t answered my ques- 
tion,” Twofour said. “You still 
haven’t told me what you’re doing 



10

out here alone. Did you get lost from 
your tribe?” 

“I was separated from my tribe a 
long time ago,” she explained. “At 
first I tried to find them, but it was 
hard; they kept moving all the time. 
Then I found I could do pretty well 
on my own.” 

Twofour looked at her carefully. 

‘‘I don’t know,” he mused. ‘‘You 
don’t look like the kind of person 
who could do that; the world’s a 
rugged place. Full of some pretty 
ugly things. For example, how do 
you know I’m not some crazed 
mutant who was planning to tear 
you apart and eat you?” 

“I can tell,” she said. “I don’t 
know how, but I can.” 

He shrugged his massive shoul- 
ders, and returned to playing the 
harmonium. Tien watched his fin- 
gers do a graceful dance on the le- 
vers of the instrument, filling the air 
with chime-like tones, diamond- 
notes against a velvet background, 
blue-green, amber melodies. She 
felt a current of joy well up deep 
inside her spine, waves of it spread- 
ing through her body. 

“You must be a minstrel,” she 
sighed. “I’ve never heard music 
that beautiful, not even in my 
grandmother’s tribe, and they could 
do amazing things. How do you 
live? Do you play for food?” 

He answered her as he played. 

“I guess I am what you might 
call a minstrel; I wander a lot. 
Don’t like to stay in one place too 
long.” 

EVENING SONG, NIGHT DANCER 



“Are you a robber?” 

“No,” he said, “I’ve never 
robbed a soul in my life. Never had 
to. I forage for food — berries, wild 
vegetables mostly. Now and then I 
join a tribe for a while and play for 
them, help them carry wood, build 
wagons. I have a strong back.” 

She looked at him. He had the 
back of a horse, strong glossy 
shoulders, sleek neck. His head was 
a man’s head, though; she looked 
into his dark eyes. They were sensi- 
tive, almost shy. “Much like a 
man,” she thought. “A good 
man.” 

Her mind began to blossom like a 
red lily in the gardens of New-D. 
Twofour continued to play. He 
played soft, eerie music that re- 
minded her of dark ruins and moss, 
of the sound of animals in the 
night — the lowly ur-animals and the 
confused half-animals that bayed 
and howled under the full moon. 

Twofour looked at her. 

She was breathtakingly beautiful. 
In addition, her arms and back 
looked strong. He felt his nostrils 
dilating. 

Tien breathed deeply. Her mind 
was wide and transparent; it seemed 
to have no limit. She could sense 
life stirring all around her: insects 
carrying particles of food, following 
their monotonous tracks through 
towering blades of grass; squirrels 
nestling together in the dank hol- 
lows of trees; wild dogs bounding 
over the wet grass of pastures, yelp- 
ing at the evening smells. Through 

11 




the trees, the sky glowed deep gold. 

Twofour couldn’t take his eyes 
off Tien. Honey-tongue, he thought. 
Soft, bare-skinned descendant of a 
race of hunters . antique crown 
of all creatures. 

She looked at him with surprise. 
A smile spread across her face as 
she instinctively touched her thighs. 
“You would like to be my mate?” 

Twofour laughed self-con- 
sciously. “How did you know?” he 
asked. 

“I sensed it,” she said. “My 
body grew warm, as though I were 
sitting by a campfire.” 

“I’ll take good care of you,” he 
assured her. “You needn’t worry.” 

“I know,” she said. “I can sense 
that too.” 

He came over to her, she put her 
arms around him. 

“We might even be able to have 
children,” he said softly. 

His voice seemed to come from 
deep within a cavern. It was low 
and distant, and seemed to echo. 
“The angelfood,” she said to her- 
self. 

In a second that seemed to last 
hours, she had a vision. She saw a 
sun, rising over a plowed field. 
Wolves and wild horses paced 
around the edge of the furrowed 
land, sniffing die air, confused by 
the lines of turf that crossed their 
old pasture in a straight pattern they 
had never seen before— disturbing, 
alien lines. Where once they had 
run among wildflowers and bram- 
bles, they now padded gingerly over 



neatly up-turned earth. As the red 
orb rose above the field, green 
shoots pushed through the soil, and 
in seconds, climbed smoothly to- 
ward the sun, blossoming and bear- 
ing fruit. Out of that glossy fruit 
burst creatures like Twofour and 
herself. They left the field and went 
out into the other valleys of the 
world, where they built snow-white 
towers out of marble and gardens 
more lush than the earth had ever 
seen — even more lush than the fa- 
bled dome-gardens of New-D. And 
all creatures came to those 
gardens — men and animals and 
half-animals — and all walked to- 
gether, cultivated vegetables, and 
played in the crystal pools. 

Twofour stroked her cheek. 

She opened her eyes. 

Then, a rustle of leaves. Snap- 
ping twigs. 

“Hell, would you look at that?” 
a man said. 

“I see it but I don’t believe it,” 
said the other 

“One of them crazy half- 
breeds.” 

“Thought Alpha team had 
cleared them away years ago. ’ ’ 

“Damn Foundation men. Long 
dead and we’re still cleaning up af- 
ter them.” The one wiped spittle 
off his lips with , a leather glove. 
Twofour recognized their white 
metallic clothing — surviving humans 
from the neighboring valley. 

“It wasn’t the Foundation,” the 
one said, “Just Chan and them 
Biolab people. You know —

GALAXY 




Operation Newlife and all that, right 
after the plague. 

“You think we should kill them? 
Or take them back to the settle- 
ment?’ ’ 

The first man raised a metal cyl- 
inder with a grid of fine wires at 
the end. “Ain’t no room for them 
at the settlement — not enough food 
to go around as it is.” 

“But that one looks human,” the 
other protested. “The girl.” 

The first man grinned, eyeing her 
from the ground up. “Yeah, she 
does look human. But she ain’t. 
Probably descended from one of 
those gypsies that ran away from the 
first settlement. Look at her; she’s 
wild. Who knows how messed-up 
her genes are.” 

“Yeah,” the other agreed. “She 
might not be half-animal, but she 
sure looks half animal.” 

“There’s no doubt about what we 
have to do,” the first man con- 
tinued. “It’s us or them. Of course, 
we can have a little fun with the 
girl first.” He raised his metal cyl- 
inder higher and pointed it at 
Twofour. 

Then suddenly their eyes went 
blank. They dropped their strange 
cylinders and stood for a moment as 
though in a stupor. Suddenly, they 
ripped off their clothes and ran 
through the trees laughing and 
grunting. 

Twofour, stunned, looked at 
Tien. 

“What happened?” he asked. 

“It’s something my mind can do 



without my willing it,” she replied. 
“I felt it. It happens when some- 
body threatens me. Anyway, they’re 
happier now and we’re safe.” 

Twofour smiled. He laughed at 
his earlier impression that Tien was 
a helpless fawn of a woman. To- 
gether they would begin a fine race, 
he thought. 

“I guess we should leave here,” 
he said. “In spite of your talent, I 
don’t like to take chances with the 
Degenerates. They’re too violent — 
too dangerous.” 

“Where could we go?” Tien 
asked. 

He thought for a minute. 

They could run wild, of course, 
as he was used to doing. But that 
wouldn’t be right for her. Although 
he hated the idea of responsibilities, 
he did think that his life could stand 
some order — within reason. 

“We must join a tribe,” he an- 
nounced. “That’s the only answer. 
I could play and sing for them, 
carry lumber, and you could wear 
gold bracelets and dance.” 

“That would be nice,” she 
agreed. “I think I know where Blue 
Bear tribe is,” she continued. “Last 
time I saw them they had set up 
camp about two miles Over South 
Ridge. We could get there before 
tomorrow’s dawn if we leave 
now.” 

“Faster than that — hop on.” 

She climbed upon his back, hug- 
ging his sides with her long legs. 

Together they rode off into the 
warm night. ★

He had fled from intimacy with 
his own kind — how then could 
he join minds with this 
hairless biped?! 



PART ONE - Sedora 

CrEV CARLYLE HAD LITTLE SUCCeSS 
in concealing his exasperation. 
“Cephean,” he said, “you do 
know how to fly a ship — I mean, 
you flew your own, right?” 

“Hyiss-yiss!” insisted the cyn- 
thian. “Hoff khorss.” Cephean was 
large as a tiger and black as coal 
dust. His eyes were molten copper, 
flecked with gold, and he was 
plump and furry, like an enormous 
Persian cat. 

Carlyle was trying to explain to 
him about starship flying, rigger- 
style, but nothing ever seemed to 
sink in. It was not, Carlyle thought, 
something which ought to need ex- 
plaining. Not at this juncture, any- 
way. “Follow my lead, is all I want 
you to do,” he said. “You can 
sense my guidance of the ship. Just 
back me up.” He looked at the 
cynthian questioningly (and felt a 
rush of impatience , a sense of 

AUEN PERSUASION 



preoccupation — Cephean ’ s) . 

The cynthian looped his tail be- 
hind his triangular ears, and his 
eyes blinked and flickered in the 
subdued light of the bridge. “Hi 
khann ff-hollow,” he hissed. 

Carlyle cleared his throat dubi- 
ously. Could he? The explanations 
all seemed to go over his head, 
though of course the cynthian was 
not really listening to the words 
themselves. “Okay,” he said. 
“Let’s try it again. This time work 
with me, not against me.” Or we’re 
never going to get there, he added 
silently. Sedora was a long way 
from any starport. 

Cephean dutifully padded over to 
the makeshift stern-rigger station, 
followed by his two riffmar, the 
walking ferns that accompanied him 
everywhere. Cephean sat and Car- 
lyle tilted the back of the partially 
dismantled seat until it rested 
against the cynthian’s spine. Cep- 
hean tensed for a moment, then re- 
laxed. 

Carlyle hastened to join him, re- 
clining in the pilot-rigger seat until 
the neural-foam pad touched his 
own backbone. He felt an instant of 
numbness, as his eyesight darkened, 
and then his senses sprang like elec- 
tric fire, out of his body and into 
the ship’s net. Flux-space curled 
about him in a majestic panorama 
of colorfully layered smoke. Stars, 
nebulae and the currents of the in- 
terstellar seas melded in whorled 
and flowing atmospheres. Here and 
there, stars were Visible as nuclei of 

15 



distant vortices; most were mere 
flecks of carbon dust adrift in 
luminous space. Below Sedora's 
glittery net, a channeled intersection 
of two planes marked the Reid Cur- 
rent, an even-flowing, deeply sub- 
merged channel in the multi- 
dimensional ocean of flux-space. 
The Reid was Carlyle’s immediate 
objective. 

The Reid itself would be easily 
navigable, but at its end it emptied 
into a different sort of current — the 
Hurricane Flume, a violent meeting 
and surging and tangling of cur- 
rents, a wholly perilous place that 
Sedora would reach in a half-dozen 
days. From within the Flume 
streamed the upwelling currents to 
Cunnilus Banks, and in those Banks 
lay Carlyle’s destination — and the 
nearest havens. If they could reach 
Cunnilus Banks, they would be 
home-free. 

But to get there they had to navi- 
gate the Flume — and that was why 
Carlyle was scared. Sedora was a 
four-rigger starfreighter — which un- 
til the accident had been manned by 
five crew(wo)men. Now Carlyle 
was alone — except for Cephean. 

Singlehandedly , Carlyle could 
barely manage the ship and the 
Flume was going to hit him like a 
cyclone. But with his shipwrecked 
cynthian aboard, he liked to think 
that there would be two of them to 
do the flying. There had better 
be — or they were both doomed. 

You there? he asked. 

Hyiss. 



He released the stabilizers, 
reached his steely, spidery, sensory 
arms into the streamers of flux- 
space, and coaxed the ship down- 
ward. Behind him, he hoped, Cep- 
hean was comprehending and help- 
ing. 

Consider starship-rigging for a 
moment. A demanding profession, 
requiring from a human rather par- 
ticular and peculiar aptitudes. For 
the rigger, starflight was akin to 
free-wheeling fantasy, and flux- 
space therefore to the mistily- 
mapped realm of the waking dream. 
Riggers were dreamers, but of a 
special sort — not idle ones, but 
dreamers who could reach through a 
vision, to gain a fingerhold in 
another, and sometimes more use- 
ful, reality. The net was his har- 
ness, allowing the ship to drift with 
him, like a backpack, while he used 
the ebbs and flows of flux-space it- 
self for transport. It was a realm 
unconcerned with the laws or dis- 
tances of normal-space, and it was a 
fine way to travel. 

The dreaming, though — that was 
the tricky part. 

The net itself was a glittery 
spangle of ghost neurons flung into 
flux-space like the exploded tenta- 
cles of a Man-o-war. Interfaced 
through organic neural foam and 
amplified by the flux-pile, it was 
the rigger’s skin against space, his 
wings and fins in the turbulent air/ 
sea among the stars. The rigger 
guided the ship by intuition, by his 



16 



GALAXY 




own individual imaging powers. 

Intuition: that was the second 
tricky part, especially among a 
crew. No two riggers viewed flux- 
space identically; teamwork de- 
manded a gestalt, a deep intermix- 
ing of visions, of perceptions, of 
selves. Functioning smoothly to- 
gether, several riggers could sail a 
ship easily among the stars; at odds 
within the net, at best they would 
bob helplessly, at worst they would 
tear a ship to pieces. 

The teamwork had always been 
the toughest part for Carlyle. Such 
openness, such nakedness. And 
now — with an alien stranger? The 
dreampool might well be the only 
way. He shuddered at the thought. 

As THE SHIP ENTERED the Reid, 
Carlyle cursed the cynthian’s 
clumsy efforts. His anger rang in 
echoes round the net and vanished 
in the noise of space. Cephean 
homm-humm’d to himself some- 
where sternward, keeping his 
thoughts private and consistently re- 
sponding late to Carlyle’s initia- 
tives. The ship bucked and plunged 
like an angty whale. 

Gently, Cephean! Do you see the 
river ? 

Whass? Whass? 

A “river,” yes, that was an 
adequate image. The lanes of the 
Reid congealed, darkened into 
molasses, flattened beneath a glit- 
tery sky and flowed swirling be- 
tween two misty riverbanks; Sedora 
settled her hull into the waters and 



moved quickly downstream through 
the night. The net shimmered be- 
neath the hull, beneath the dark sur- 
face of the river. The Flume was 
invisible, not even a distant mutter; 
but beyond it in the distance a dim 
streamer rose to meet Cunnilus 
Banks, a faint cloud of particles in 
the night. 

The ship lurched again, as Cep- 
hean clumsily bumped the stern 
askew. Cephean; follow] 

FJhollow-hing, Caharleel! 

No rapport, he thought, straining 
to guide the ship. What did Janofer 
used to say? That a crew needn’t 
understand one another, or even be 
friends . that the crux was con- 
gruence, simple congruence of vis- 
ion. And Skan — that without unity 
none of the rest was worth a mote 
in the Kryst Nebula. That was why 
they had sent him to crew Sedora, 
had sent him kindly, firmly, hoping 
he might learn here what he 
couldn’t from them. 

This Cephean, though, was more 
like Legroeder, so alone with his 
thoughts — even in the net, where 
privacy tended to dissolve. Except 
Legroeder always worked in har- 
mony, despite his aloneness, and 
could be either leader or follower; 
Cephean it seemed, could be nei- 
ther. 

Carlyle kept up the struggle for a 
time — jockeying, trimming the ship, 
compensating for Cephean’s mis- 
takes. How did he ever fly his own 
ship? Carlyle muttered. Finally he 
called; Cephean, pull out of the net. 



AUEN PERSUASION 



17 




which the cynthian did, humming 
and grumbling, and Carlyle infused 
the entire net with his strength and 
bucked the ship into line where it 
belonged. Then he put it on 
stabilizers and withdrew him- 
self . and gazed with tired eyes 
about the bridge, before retiring to 
the commons, and then to his cabin. 

To regain the feel of a human 
body, to eat, to sleep a while, to 
find and lecture the cynthian — and 
to try again, once more. 

Remembering: 

After the accident — trying to 
summon the faces of his dead 
crewmates. He had rigged with 
them for only seven days and now 
could not recall their names. He had 
been lucky, or he would have died 
with them. Lucky? 

Other names came to him, 
though: Janofer, Legroeder, and 
Skan — the names clicked through 
his head like the chatter of a rad 
counter, rhythmically, Janofer Leg- 
roeder and Skan. 

The faces came later. Legroeder: 
dark little man, pilot-rigger, lover 
of dream-gestalt plays, but often 
shut away in his cabin, a place 
madly adorned with mystical- 
sequenced pearlgazers. Janofer: gen- 
tle, beautiful keel-lifter, fond of 
stories and music even in the web, 
briefly a lover and always a friend. 
Skan: com-rigger and hard-balanced 
thinker, the one to believe in when 
decisions were to be made, but 
fearsome when his balance crum- 



bled and he plummeted into one of 
his deep, black depressions. 

Why couldn’t they be here now 
in this battered vessel? 

Lady Brillig — glittering domed 
beauty of a ship, light and comfort- 
able, and responsive as a kite! Who 
was the fourth, now, in her rig? 
Who, Lady Brilligl 

Eventually, though, such thoughts 
had to be put by. With great trepi- 
dation he took his place alone, for 
the first time, in Sedora ' s net. 
There was no choice but to fly if he 
could; the vulnerable and delicate 
transmission gear had been fried 
along with his crewmates. He was 
almost astonished when he sank his 
fingers into the stuff of space and 
the ship moved at his bidding. 

Sedora was ponderous, and flew 
as if laden with water. He could 
only work her for short, deadening 
shifts; his stamina deteriorated 
rapidly even so. He thought of the 
Flume ahead, considered and dis- 
carded other courses, thought of the 
Flume again, and knew he hadn’t a 
chance in a thousand. 

Therefore hope, when it ap- 
peared, was strange. 

The signal had seemed a part of 
the windrush, part of the starsong of 
the net. But like a warbling bird it 
would not be ignored, and finally 
he decided that just perhaps he was 
hearing a distress beacon; and with 
tightly suppressed excitement he 
wheeled Sedora into the clouds to 
find the source. The search nearly 
drained him — ten hours of puffing 



18 



GALAXY 




through crazy blue skies with gold- 
en veils and spun hair arching 
across the stars like a yellow- 
brick road. 

At last he found it; a flattened 
raisin of a spacecraft, drifting 
abeam of Sedora in the queer near- 
distance of flux-space. He grappled 
it and took it spiraling up with him 
through layered images of space- 
times, into spinning, velvet 
darknesses . until at last the stars 
exploded in bright pricks of light — 
and he looked out through the 
clearplex port into normalspace. 

The ship was squat, strange; 
alien. 

He suited up and floated across to 
it. From space, Sedora was cold, a 
gun-grey cetacean, linked to him 
only by a snaking lifeline. His soles 
touched the other ship; he wondered 
who he might find, and whether 
perhaps the strangeness was only 
beginning. 



Following a poor night’s sleep, 
Carlyle entered Cephean’s quarters. 
The cynthian hardly noticed as he 
sat idly batting the two giggling 
riffmar into floating somersaults. 
Carlyle cleared his throat. The ferns 
squealed and scuttled away behind 
Cephean, their oversized hands flail- 
ing excitedly. How strange it must 
be, Carlyle thought, to be so utterly 
dependent — both for Cephean and the 
riffmar. Cephean was master, but 
the riffmar had the hands and the 
prehensile branches. How helpless 

AUEN PERSUASION 



would the cynthian be without 
them? 

“Cephean, let’s talk.” 

The cynthian gazed at him, ears 
forward. (He sensed mild interest.) 
“Hyiss?” 

“Cephean,” he said, and 
hesitated — “this is sort of ridicu- 
lous, isn’t it? Here we are lucky 
enough to be able to help each 
other, and now we can’t seem to 
make it work. We both know how 
to fly, and there should be no 
reason why we can’t do it.” He 
eyed the cynthian and asked almost 
pleadingly, “don’t you want to 
reach port, don’t you want to go 
home?” 

“Hyiss — yiss,” Cephean replied, 
his whiskers curling and springing 
straight again. “Hi ffly wiss hyou,” 
he hissed, his velvety face split in 
an apparent grin. 

“Yeh. What went wrong, last 
time? Why didn’t you work with 
me?” 

Cephean’s breath hissed over his 
teeth, as he seemed to consider Car- 
lyle’s statement. Behind him, the 
riffmar rustled and sssk’d quietly as 
they buried their feet in the nutrient 
bed. Cephean touched a forepaw to 
his nose and said, “Hi ss-ry. Hiss 
d-hifficulss.” (An impression of 
shame flickered across Carlyle’s 
mind.) “Hyou ffly, Caharleel.” 
(The image was followed by a 
strange, dark longing, unidentifiable 
and then gone altogether.) 

Carlyle grimaced, wishing that he 
did not have to play guessing 

19 




games. Cephean, apparently reading 
his thoughts, stirred nervously. 

“All right. We’ll try it again, in 
a little while. If we don’t do better 
this time, we’ll have to try some- 
thing else.” He did not mention the 
dreampool, but it loomed large in 
his thoughts; the cynthian started, 
and looked away. 

Odomilk. An image of the strange 
pods drifted eerily through Carlyle’s 
mind. The cynthian was issuing 
commands; the riffmar scrambled to 
lift two odomilk pods from the 
cache, and set them deliberately in 
front of Cephean. The cynthian 
cracked one carefully in his jaws, 
and sucked at the yellowish liquid 
that oozed out. He looked at Carlyle 
with upturned eyes, making plain 
his discomfort at Carlyle’s presence. 

Carlyle left him, and went to the 
commons. He toyed with a flo- 
globe, sipped a beermalt, flashed a 
sparkle-pattem in ringlets about the 
room: stoic . erotic . pastor- 
al ... he stared at the wall. 

Their next session in the net be- 
gan not much differently. Cephean 
hummed away with his own 
thoughts, while Carlyle pleaded, 
pried, cajoled — and the ship side- 
slipped and trembled in the smooth- 
flowing Reid. Cephean, open up — 
turn your thoughts outward, into the 
net. The cynthian hummed and mut- 
tered, and whistled an unintelligible 
reply. The ship swayed in the 
clouds, whipped. 

Follow, dammit ! 



F-hollow-hing. 

Carlyle flew a few more practice 
turns, and then he flew straight, rest- 
ing. Janofer came to him quietly, 
unbidden, with a question: Can you 
go it alone, Gev? You may have to 
try. Don’t ask me that, Janofer. 
Gentle Janofer, silver-haired keel- 
girl, you know I can’t go it alone, 
but you always ask. Why must you? 
A wrong fit in the net warps it like 
a gravity abscess in a calm 
stream . dangerous. You are 
sometimes like that, Gev, for all 
that we love you — dangerous. Do 
you think I don’t know? All 
right — I’m a lousy rigger. 

Janofer, face darkening: That’s 
not what I mean, Gev. You’re a fine 
rigger. But . 

Skan, interjecting flatly, not un- 
sympathetically: You’re a lousy 
matcher, Gev, that’s all. You’d be 
fine in a one-rigger . except you 
like company too much. Too bad 
you don't have a bit of Legroeder in 
you. 

Skan. Always right, never tactful, 
damn you. Stay with me a while, 
Jan, will you? 

Sad, already distant gaze: Can’t, 
Gev — I can't. I’m gone, now. Later, 
perhaps, if you really need me. 
Perhaps then, for a while. And with 
that she was gone and so was Skan. 

Then, perhaps, eh? Janofer so 
kind, so courteous — you hurt even 
when you are here. 

Carlyle brought his attention back 
to the ship, which was drifting 
again. The ship resisted his efforts 



20 



GALAXY 




to bring her true; no assistance from 
Cephean. More strength was 
needed, though; he was taxing him- 
self grievously as he flexed his 
spidery ghost-neuron arms in the 
current. And then a curious thing 
happened. Legroeder appeared in 
his thoughts, wordlessly, and en- 
tered the net at the keel station. 
Smiling enigmatically at Carlyle, 
the former crewmate lifted the ship, 
helped steady the axis along the 
blue haze of the mainflow, and 
pointed the nose where it belonged, 
at the distant glitter of Cunnilus 
Banks. The maneuver was done 
smoothly, almost effortlessly. 

All right, Carlyle thought in sur- 
prise. Why not? The power, he 
knew, was his own, focused 
through a wistful memory. But if he 
flew better through a memory, what 
harm? 

Sedora sailed placidly for a time, 
and Carlyle almost forgot about 
Cephean, silent at the stem. Then a 
turbulent stretch loomed ahead, an 
orange tributary streaming in from 
the left, setting the calm blue haze 
of the mainflow aswirl with danger- 
ous eddies. Legroeder? Yes, still 
there. The ship shivered into the 
current, and Carlyle with Legroe- 
der’ s help stretched out steely arms 
and labored like an oarsman to keep 
it under control. They needed more 
strength still; they had to aim 
deeper. 

Janofer and Skan reappeared as 
quickly as the thought — and all 
three backed him in the net as he 



hooked his nails into the fabric of 
space and wheeled the ship slowly 
to find its new direction. Silently 
and without fanfare, Carlyle found 
himself part of a perfect gestalt, and 
as one the four riggers brought Sed- 
ora into a down-welling and then 
leveled her again in a smoother 
layer of current. 

The fantasy was a white lie. He 
had never managed gestalt with the 
three, hard as he had tried. If he 
had he would still be on Lady Bril- 
lig. But the image was perfect in 
his mind- — it was the gestalt for 
which he had yearned, and Sedora 
flew with the grace of an eagle. The 
image multiplied in scope and Sed- 
ora winged silently over sprawling 
tufted clouds which glittered whitely 
about him. Carlyle forgot his loneli- 
ness, realizing with sudden dizzi- 
ness how terribly lonely he had 
been. Janofer’s music lilted calm- 
ingly through the net, and Skan’s 
control lay steady and sure over the 
gestalt. Even Legroeder, pretending 
to ignore them all, smiled with un- 
spoken affection. 

Time, in the gestalt, passed un- 
noticed. 

But the image was as tiring as it 
was exhilarating. Carlyle, bearing 
the load of four-riggers in one, 
slowly became aware of the strain 
he was enduring — and then it was 
too late. His strength failed like 
rapidly souring wine — his senses 
dimmed and flattened, and the ship 
balked in his disintegrating rein. 

Suddenly he could not remember 

21 



ALIEN PERSUASION 




his friends’ faces or their voices. 
The ship began to tumble; he 
wanted to sleep, to collapse. How 
long had he been flying? 

Caharleel, Cephean whispered 
urgently. 

Cephean ! My god. Can you help, 
can you hold the keel steady ? The 
fine spiderweb of the net was com- 
ing apart, was untangling in the 
clouds. 

Hyiss. 

Cephean ’s presence grew quickly 
in the net, and Carlyle felt first re- 
lief, then panic. Could the cynthian 
handle the ship? He felt a blur of 
annoyance — and distracted bewil- 
derment at . what? ... at the 
humans who had appeared and tak- 
en things over for a while, and then 
vanished. And . eagerness? Be- 
fore Carlyle could think about it in 
his dullness, the sensations disap- 
peared. Cephean had hastily re- 
closed the lid on his feelings, and 
hissed faintly now as he wielded the 
ship over Carlyle’s failing control. 

He took the ship deeper. Sedora 
dived steeply, terrifyingly. The 
cloud-image vanished for Carlyle, 
and suddenly he was deep underwa- 
ter, and sinking rapidly. No, Cep- 
hean! What are you doing? Level 
off, bring it up! He opposed the 
cynthian desperately, and in the 
conflict the net strained and spar- 
kled brightly, heatedly, then began to 
break, tear, shred. The ship tumbled 
deeper and broke completely 
through the Reid, so that the Cur- 
rent was only a shimmering ocean 



surface above them as they fell to- 
ward the abyss. The space here was 
dark as night, perpetually dark, far 
deeper than Carlyle had ever dared 
venture. Cephean was trying to de- 
stroy them and Carlyle seemed 
powerless to resist. 

Like a stricken diver screaming 
for air, Carlyle reacted in blind 
panic, badly, in the only way he 
knew. He triggered the fusors: they 
flared searingly hot, and the ship 
groaned and rose upward roaring on 
the throttled torches, a fuming trail 
burning in their wake. He had failed 
to numb the sensory field astern, so 
the heat of the jets crawled along 
his spine with clear, glazing, flash- 
ing agony. Cephean’s scream was a 
silent shriek of pain; centered in 
the stem rig, the cynthian was tak- 
ing the brunt of the sun-fury, but 
Carlyle was too sticken to speak or 
to help. Fragments of cynthian 
thought flew like shrapnel: Ru- 
hinned . ss-l-how . de-h-mise! 
The rest was lost — too fleeting — but 
Carlyle heard a gasp of astonish- 
ment as Cephean jerked out of the 
net and found relief. 

The fusors were dreadfully 
inefficient — but they worked, and 
they sustained an image of directed 
movement, so that Carlyle gradually 
found himself regaining a 
semblance of control. The surface of 
the Reid came toward him as the 
ship rose, then fogged, and sput- 
tered in the jet-flare. When at last 
the fusors shut down the ship’s keel 
drifted once again in the mainflow 



22 



GALAXY 




of the Reid came toward him as the 
held by a tangled remnant of the 
control web. Carlyle set the 
stabilizers and withdrew, barely 
conscious, from the net. 

He sensed the cynthian nearby, 
jittery and numb and bewildered — 
but he was too exhausted to look. 
His veins flowed with lead, and be- 
fore he could rise from the seat he 
felt his eyelids close, and he sank 
helplessly into unconsciousness. 

Images of the quarm fluttered 
naggingly, incessantly. A strange 
communion, cynthian heads bowed 
in a circle, whiskers twitching — 
thoughts fleeing selves, joining 
/regrouping /intermixing like buffet- 
ing winds — shared dreams in strange 
places, in imaginary bodies. The 
images were flavored with distaste, 
with bile-sour anger towards others 
in the quarm, with resentment at be- 
ing an unwilling participant. But 
was not the quarm a relief, an es- 
cape from identity, a boon to a 
weary, confined mind? Was it not 
natural? Why did Cephean so want 
to be alone? 

Carlyle awoke confused and 
dizzy. He focused with difficulty on 
his cabin walls as he tried to re- 
cover the recent past. Recollections 
filtered fuzzily into his brain; he 
had awakened — years ago, it 
seemed — exhausted on the bridge, 
and had stumbled to his cabin and 
bunk. He had slept — how long? — 
two shipdays. Jesus. Memories, 



dreams — he had picked up more 
from Cephean than he had realized. 

The flying — Lord, trying to fly as 
four-riggers-in-one! It might well 
have killed him. 

Rousing himself, he went to the 
commons, ate ravenously. After- 
wards he drew a mug of hermit ale, 
and sat — knowing that he should go 
look for Cephean. 

Before he had done so, however, 
memory-faces rejoined him and held 
conference. Skan, shaking his head: 
“No flow, Gev. You’ve got to bring 
that plump cat right into the 
rigging — wring him out, make him 
respond. 

“Thanks, Skan. Care to help?” 

Skan, smiling now: “I have, 
Gev.’’ 

Janofer, flowing and concerned: 
' ‘Perhaps you should think of trying 
alone, Gev. Or if you must, use the 
dreampool." 

The dreampool — frightening 

enough with another human; 
machine-assisted intimacy. Now, 
with an alien? “Just like the old 
days? That’s how you’ve always 
spoken to me.’’ 

“I’ve tried, Gev — you know that. 
But always there was something 
that wouldn’t connect between us.’’ 

“ How many times did you try. 
Twice? Three times?" 

“Which nearly broke me. It 
wouldn’t work, Gev — it just 
wouldn’t.” 

“Hm.” 

" You are a beautiful friend, 
though.”

“ Thanks .’’ 

“You’re coming up on the 
Flume, soon, Gev. Don’t be think- 
ing about us. We’ll help all we can, 
but if you depend on us, you’ll bum 
yourself out.’’ 

Skan: “The cat — you’ve got to get 
the cat working with you or you'll 
never make it.’’ 

“He acts suicidal.’’ 

Legroeder, from somewhere, 
looked up and nodded, but distrac- 
tedly, as if his real thoughts were 
elsewhere. Janofer, whispering soft- 
ly, drew close and brushed him with 
a kiss, a breath of moist wind 
touching him from afar, and then 
withdrew, her voice a fading note 
on the air. Carlyle stirred restless- 
ly- 

After a time he rose and left the 
commons, thinking to find Cephean 
and — what? Okay, time to act like a 
commander and start kicking ass. 
Right. 

Cephean was not in his quarters. 
Carlyle stood in the starboard-main 
corridor under the humming 
brushed-bronze stabilizer arch, 
and — feeling slightly silly — 
considered where to look next. 
What might Cephean have been do- 
ing while he slept? Unsupervised, 
the cynthian might have gotten into 
almost anything. 

The bridge was deserted. 
Likewise the commons and com- 
munications coop. Worried, Carlyle 
began a more systematic search — 
dreampool theater, engineering, util- 
ity storage, exercise room, lifecon- 

24 



trol, airlock, conversion room. He 
checked the fluxfield chamber with- 
out entering; the suits were all in 
place, and the monitors assured him 
that the pile shield had not been 
breached. 

That left only the cargo hold. 
Carlyle was not sure what all Sed- 
ora carried but much of it was 
bound to be valuable. He went be- 
low and looked. 

“Damn you, Cephean!” he 
breathed. Number three cargo port 
was ajar, and a tattered bit of some- 
thing lay on the deck — a broken 
riffmar leaf. Carlyle stepped inside. 
The hold was gloomy, and webbed 
with crisscrossed anchoring strands, 
from which were suspended 
Lifecybe organic computor cores, 
each in a fried-egg shaped cradle 
with umbilical to a central support 
unit. Each was worth a fortune. 

Cephean was on the far side of 
the hold, hunched over one of the 
cradles. Carlyle started that way — 
and was stopped in midstride, mes- 
merized by a flashing light which 
danced in a quick series of circles 
about the room — external stimula- 
tion for the cores. He shook his 
head, and hurried across the com- 
partment. 

Cephean looked up at him. 

“What are you doing here?’’ he 
demanded, struggling to sound dip- 
lomatic; he looked down at the 
riffmar, who rustled quickly around 
behind Cephean. (He sensed dis- 
concertment, frustration .) 

The cynthian hissed noncommit- 

GALAXY 




tally, his whiskers curling. 
“Caharlel — hyor com-ffusors 

nohwork.” 

Carlyle looked at him narrowly. 
“Of course not. They’ll work when 
they’re installed in computor tanks. 
Right now they’re just being kept 
alive for shipment.” 

‘‘D-heds now,” Cephean in- 
sisted. 

Carlyle froze, eyeing the cyn- 
thian. What was that supposed to 
mean? He shoved past Cephean and 
looked into the cradle behind him. 
The neural tissue, visible under a 
clearplex dome, quivered faintly; it 
was dark and smoky, and a glance 
at the cradle monitor confirmed that 
the core was dead. He whirled. 
“Did you do this?” he said. 

The cunthian’s face twitched, un- 
readable. “Hi h-make missthake,” 
he hissed. 

‘‘You what!” Carlyle shouted. 
‘‘What did you try to do?” He 
glared, caught the cynthian’s eye, 
held it insistently. “What did you 
do?” he repeated. 

Cephean sputtered, and pawed his 
nose. He half-snarled an answer, 
incomprehensible. The riffmar 
lurched toward Carlyle, then re- 
treated. Carlyle asked again, in- 
sisted. Cephean cast his gaze about 
anxiously and cried, “Hiss who- 
odens hansser h-me!” He hunched 
fearfully, mournfully, and shook his 
head. 

Carlyle checked other nearby 
units, and found one more ruined. 
“Why are you wrecking my car- 



go?” he demanded, almost shouting 
now. Cephean gave in, and sput- 
tered finally that he had been trying 
to question the computor cores. He 
had thought that they were hiding 
something, information of some 
kind, about the ship. 

Carlyle was incredulous. “Why 
didn’t you ask me what you wanted 
to know? This is just a mass of 
nerve tissue — works when it’s part 
of a unit. It’s delicate! You can’t 
pump it as if it were a ship’s com- 
puter. What did you want to know, 
anyway?’ ’ He looked around disgus- 
tedly. The two cores were expen- 
sive losses — not that it would mat- 
ter, if they failed to reach port. 
More appalling was Cephean ’s lack 
of good sense, or of understanding 
of the human systems aboard ship. 

“Damn it!” he barked, making a 
decision. “We’re going to get some 
things straight. Right now.” The 
cynthian looked startled. (A jolt of 
surprise, apprehension, crossed 
Carlyle’s mind.) 

“I’m not going to like this any 
more than you,” he said deter- 
minedly, “but I think at last we’re 
going to understand one another.” 
The riffmar squealed; he glared at 
them. 

“Follow me.” 

Cephean followed him out of the 
hold, shaking and hissing. 

PART TWO — The Dreampool 
The dreampool theater was 



ALIEN PERSUASION 



25 




lighted only by a deepsea gloom. 
The pool, circular and still, was en- 
closed by a smooth, padded ledge; 
the water radiated a sourceless, 
ocean-blue light. The depth of the 
water was visually indeter- 
minable — the water appeared 
simply to merge with the inner 
wall, and only the glow could be 
seen in its depths. Good place to 
dive and never come up, Carlyle 
thought; he adjusted the lighting and 
the sensory responders. 

“Whass?” Cephean queried sus- 
piciously, circling about the pool 
and coming back to eye Carlyle 
nervously. 

“Dreampool,” Carlyle said. 
“Used by rigger-crews to help de- 
velop rapport. I didn’t want to use 
it, because it was designed, really, 
for human minds — and frankly it 
can be pretty damn personal. 

“Well, we’re going to test it be- 
tween a cynthian and a human.” 

Cephean ’s flickering eyes seemed 
to turn inward. His whiskers 
writhed; and the riffmar shuddered 
sympathetically. “H-no-o, no-o!” 
he hissed. He drew himself into a 
defensive crouch and glared at Car- 
lyle stubbornly. 

“You’d rather float around in 
space for the rest of eternity?” Car- 
lyle asked sternly. “Well maybe 
you would for some reason, but 
how’d you like to drift forever hav- 
ing to look at me until you die? Eh? 
This ship goes no further until 
we’ve used the dreampool, or given 
it a good try.” 



Cephean shivered. “Damn it, no 
arguments,” said Carlyle, wonder- 
ing how far he dared assert himself. 

His determination must have been 
plain, because the cynthian ac- 
quiesced, muttering. He explained 
die procedure, and they both seated 
themselves at the pool’s edge, 
ninety degrees apart from one 
another. “Look straight into the wa- 
ter, now, and let your mind follow 
your eyes. Listen to my thoughts 
and do exactly as I do.” 

Gazing into the pool, Carlyle 
studied the luminous surface, and 
allowed his other thoughts and feel- 
ings to subside. The water was 
faintly perturbed beneath the sur- 
face, so that the light emanation 
wavered subtly; after a moment it 
was the variations rather than the 
light itself he watched — 
shimmerings in the cool bath of 
sapphire- emerald. The flickering of 
an open flame but without the 
warmth — it was alive, and it 
reached out to him and entered his 
eyes with the tranquilizing energy 
of an alert, probing mind . 

The first thoughts were his 
own memories. The death of the 
Sedora’s crew — sudden, terrible, 
the cauterizing radiation of the 
Flux-space abscess flaring through 
the rig like a bursting aurora, the 
scramblings of communications, the 
clanging alarms that brought him 
running from a maintenance chore 
in the fluxfield chamber, only to 
find the smoking bodies of his 



26 



GALAXY 




crewmates, dead at their stations. 
The shock, horror, revulsion. 

Later, garbed still in a chamber 
suit, dragging the four bodies to the 
converter chute, struggling not to 
lose his grip on himself, not at least 
until he had done what he had to 
do. Afterwards he could let himself 
go to pieces, shudderingly relive the 
horror, wondering by what fortune 
he was alive. And then, later still, 
watching the healers slowly, slowly 
regenerate the neural foam in the 
rigger seats, so that he might try to 
fly. 

Before disaster, though, was de- 
parture; unhappily boarding Sedora 
at Deusonport Field, with mixed 
and hurt feelings. He wanted to fly 
in Lady Brillig, not Sedora, but if 
they said that being helper-rigger on 
a slowship might improve him, then 
helper-rigger he would be. Deuson- 
port Field, a bit cloudy, green hills 
and forest about the perimeter, 
should be a cheery sight on return. 
Relaxed, amidst the commerce of 
the Aeregian planets. 

Earlier still, now, Lady Brillig 
out of Jarvis on Chaening’s World: 
Legroeder and Skan as usual; and 
Janofer, never quite stationary — her 
moods changing like aircurrents, 
never merely buoyant or petulant or 
contemplative or depressed; always 
a mixture, and her attention rarely 
focusing long on any one of her 
friends, but ever shifting from one 
to another to somewhere beyond the 
ken of any. Why could he not have 
been closer to them? 



And. .earlier? . .later? . 
the flight-shell of another space- 
craft: the battery of riffmar in turmoil, 
working to confused commands 
while he fought to control his fury 
and discover what was wrong. The 
riffmar were maddeningly inept, 
never mind that they only responded 
to his control. Mindless plants ! he 
shrieked silently, but it was not a 
curse, only a statement of fact. 
Why had he come so far to get in 
trouble, why had he let Comeph get 
to him like that? A riffmar, con- 
fused by his shaky control, stum- 
bled close to him; he swatted it 
squarely with his left paw, flatten- 
ing it. Six more alive, by damn, and 
they’d better start flying. But they 
wouldn’t, not unless he himself de- 
termined what was stalling the craft, 
and instructed them. If only he 
knew more about these things! 

(Strange, to be flying without 
knowing. .) 

Bring my syrup, he ordered, and 
glared at the two riffmar scurrying 
to comply, wrestling between them 
a large stalk for him to chew. He 
took it moodily in his jaws, and 
sent the two off to tend the 
riffmar-bud cultures, and then to 
feed themselves. As they wriggled 
their twiglike feet into the nutrient 
beds, Cephean turned his thoughts 
elsewhere, and brooded on his 
plight. 

He had left in a huff, before his 
time, taking a space shell from the 
docks without checking or prepar- 
ing. Bad judgement, admittedly, but 



AUEN PERSUASION 



27 




who would have thought that a sim- 
ple shell could malfunction? 
Starflight was so bloody easy — use 
riffmar to run the shell, nothing 
complicated, and let your mind 
guide the ship, like the interdream- 
ing of the quarm, but with no 
broil-damn other minds cluttering 
up your thoughts. Lord-o, he had 
needed a break from Comeph’s in- 
cessant nagging, never letting him 
rest a moment without conforming 
to the quarm — mix, mix, mingle, 
never leave a comer of anyone un- 
explored. Become a plant, become 
an alien, broil-dammit was he so 
strange, that he could not stand it? 

Ooh, just to be free of them! 
Lord-o, that’s why he had fled, but 
not to make it permanent. 

(Did they offend? Is that why you 
do not wish company?) 

( Whass ?) 

He was stalled, stalled. Why 
would the damn thing not fly! Seat- 
ed in his sunken dias, he grilled the 
riffmar on their findings (though 
they had been untended, so how 
could they find anything?), and he 
hurled abuse at their quivering 
forms, and finally leaped scream- 
ing, scattering them in fear. 
Odomilkl he shrieked, and sucked 
on the pods with a vengeance while 
the riffmar huddled in a comer. 

Nothing like pungent odomilk — 
but still, he must attend to the 
riffmar. They could perform certain 
chores by rote, but hardly what he 
was now demanding — and certainly 
he had to be careful with the six 



that were left. Perhaps there was a 
maintenance recorder. 

Humming, he set them to locat- 
ing the memory-cube and then 
obeying the cube’s silent recitation. 
Hey-now, the thoughtflow amp 
seemed to work, so maybe the con- 
trols were just out of kilter. This 
was more like it — a pity he hadn’t 
thought of the recorder sooner, but 
after all he was a forest-singer and 
not a craft-tech. Comeph — that sot- 
rotted nuisance would be laughing if 
he knew. His bloody arrogance 
could make anyone leave home. 
Comeph, with his stinking empathe- 
tic grin, diving like a fool into the 
quarm, dragging you off on a 
mindlark whether invited or not. 
Lord-o-lord, to be rid of him was 
worth even this! 

A riffmar peeked shyly at him, 
awaiting recognition. 

Useless plants! He recognized 
with a fast swat. Hah! Two with 
one blow! 

But he needed those two to fly! 
He prodded them agitatedly, but it 
was no use, they were dead. He 
sprang to all fours in alarm, his 
whiskers curling and twisting. What 
had they come to tell him? 

The four remaining riffmar hud- 
dled at the control tree, and he ap- 
proached cautiously. What had they 
learned? 

Hsss. They quivered, struggling 
to formulate a coordinated reply. 
Hssshell ffly . h-nneed more uss. 
One of them collapsed, from the 
strain, and the others bent and 



28 



GALAXY 




picked it up and carried it to the 
nutrient bed. Hsssss. 

That was it, then; he was 
finished. He had caught the image, 
brief but sufficient — the controls 
had been upset by a passing storm; 
with the help of the memory cube, 
the problem had been corrected, and 
now all he needed were six riffmar 
to operate the controls. And all he 
had left were four. 

Rage boiled slowly in his 
stomach. He could not fly with only 
four, and he could not speed the 
growth of the buds; he could switch 
on a distress beacon, but no one 
would hear it — he had flown pur- 
posely beyond cynthian space. He 
was finished, and he knew it. He 
was embarrassed beyond descrip- 
tion. 

A low wail emerged from his 
throat, and through a haze he saw 
the riffmar shrink from his anger. 
Damn them! Hissing, spitting, he 
leaped at the control tree, re- 
bounded with a crash of breaking 
elements, and launched himself at 
the riffmar. Two fell to his flailing 
paws, but in his madness he lost all 
thought, and the other two were 
able to flee shrieking to safety be- 
hind the nutrient bed. He forgot 
them, and bounded back over his 
dias, skidded, and slammed broad- 
side into the wall. Stunned, he 
staggered away and hurled himself 
yowling into the control tree again, 
where he smashed amidst splinters 
and tumbled, battered, to the deck. 

Much later, on awakening, he 







AUEN PERSUASION 



tore savagely into his stock of bram- 
leaf, and gorged himself on 
odomilk. He ignored the riffmar, 
ignored the broken controls, ignored 
his shell’s warbling distress call, 
and concentrated solely on glutting 
himself to his limit on bramleaf and 
odomilk — and not long afterward he 
sank groaning onto the dias, laid his 
head upon his tail, and slept. 

(My god, such violence! No dis- 
cipline! It’s no wonder you can’t 
coordinate with me in the net.) 

Ffsscrewhyou who kannnoss kheef 
hyor mind h-where hiss be-hlongss. 
Ffsscrew, Caharleel.) 

Awakening, he hissed in pain, his 
stomach a hard knot of burning 
complaint. His fur was matted and 
disheveled; he wanted badly oh so 
badly to regurgitate, or failing that 
to die. He fumed in silent agony, 
his eyes watery and nearly blind, 
thoughts orbiting one another in 
meaningless jokes. Could he maybe 
work the little knobs himself, with 
his big, clumsy paws? Yeh. Ooh, to 
throw the fiercest tantrum in his- 
tory! But he could hardly move for 
the cramps in his abdomen. 

When his head cleared somewhat, 
he turned grimly to his final chal- 
lenge: how to arrange for himself a 
classical demise. He looked bale- 
fully at the riffmar, sssking in the 
nutrient bed, and violence stirred 
once more in his blood. 

No, he must spare them, for the 
moment. Had he grounds for de- 
mise? Dereliction in space was em- 
barrassing, to be sure. Depressing, 



frustrating, infuriating. But was it 
humiliation enough? He could not 
be certain. What he really needed, 
for a demise that would put even 
Corneph to shame, was to be seen a 
victim rather than merely stupid. 

(Demise? What. ?) 

Later, mulling and gnawing at his 
tail, he was startled by a 
CLUNGGG ringing through the 
shell. That buzzing outside — was 
there something out there? Fasti- > 
nated, terrified, he listened. What, 
what! There were thumps, small 
quiet ones moving in a progression 
around the shell. Lord-o, lord-o, 
was space going crazy? He listened 
with his mind, and nearly spat with 
surprise. An alien walked on the 
outside of his shell. Rescue! 

Frightened stormy panic flashed 
suddenly, and ebbed. Gathering his 
wits, he sent the two riffmar to 
ready the airlock to receive the 
alien. What better humiliation could 
possibly be asked? 

Now, with assurance at last, he 
began to plan a truly graceful de- 
mise. 

Cephean, you mean you came 
aboard this ship, meaning from the 
start to — ? 

Fffssilly ssfhool! Hnow Hyou haff 
h-made h-me ffssay iss! 

But I’m trying to help you get 
home again. 

Ffssthupid! H-noss h-my home-ss. 

You could find a way home all 
right. Is your humiliation the only 
reason you want to destroy this 
ship? Wouldn’t you rather go back 



30 



GALAXY 




to laugh at Corneph or something? 

Cephean, lurching, almost crash- 
ing through the separation layer: 
No, no! Noss Corneph hin mi-mind! 

Carlyle, wondering if he was the 
only blockhead around: Cephean — I 
didn’t rescue you to embarrass you, 
or even just to save you. I needed 
help myself. There’s no humiliation 
in offering help — and that’s what l 
want you to do, offer me help. 

The separation layer shimmered 
like a curtain, and Cephean brought 
his face close, peering at Carlyle. 
Whass h-about hyor frenss hyou 
halways haff? 

Oh, them. Yes. They’re different, 
I thought you knew — memory, 
imagination — sort of like your 
quarm, l guess. 

Hyou heff no quarm! Scornfully. 
Or was that envy? 

No. But we like to think we have 
something like it; though sometimes 
wishful thinking is as close as we 
come. Except for the dreampool. 
And that can be scary — but it helps 
us work better in the rig, after- 
wards, and that’s why you’re here. 

H-wy hyor ffrens noss he If? 

That’s the whole point. That was 
all me in the net flying — and my 
crazy imagination. Maybe 1 could 
do it again, but it would never get 
me through the Flume. 

Whass iss Flume? 

Again? Here: 

The Flume. Breakup of the Reid 
Current, spawner of a dozen new 
ones. Riggers passing at peril — like 
ancient sonarmen — sounding the 



depths carefully, guessing at reflec- 
tion layers, scattering layers, deep 
transmission layers. Change was the 
only constant, and things could 
happen fast. A whirlpool luring a 
ship into its vortex; a waterspout 
lifting a ship and pinwheeling it to 
tumble lifeless back into the sea; 
white-water rapids smashing a ship 
and flinging the pieces to the 
heavens. Or — the Flume mastered 
and sailed. 

H-we kann noss! 

Yes we can, dammit. Ready for a 
demonstration in cooperation? 

The cynthian sputtered in confu- 
sion. Whass? 

The setting changed abruptly. 
They were suddenly both standing 
on a hillside meadow, facing each 
other under a beaming sun. The 
meadow lay part way upland in a 
range of rugged hills. Below and 
around it sprawled tufts and cush- 
ions of forest. Whass! Cephean was 
both astonished and indignant and 
his copper eyes flashed like buttons 
in his black velvet face. This, Car- 
lyle perceived, was a bit too much 
like the tricks old Corneph used to 
pull. Well, too bad. This is your 
world, isn’t it Cephean? 

Hyiss. Suspiciously, almost angri- 
ly- 

Carlyle nodded. The dreampool 
drew as much from Cephean as 
from him; what the cynthian didn’t 
know was that neither of them was 
in control. 

There was a sound of giggles, 
badly suppressed. Two riffmar 



ALIEN PERSUASION 



31 




poked their heads out of the grass, 
and sat up hiccuping. 

Another sound — a hissing chortle 
higher on the hill. Corneph was 
watching them delightedly; he 
looked like Cephean, only smaller, 
and with a single brown streak 
across his black, furry breast. (Car- 
lyle sensed sudden malevolence 
from Cephean.) 

Not far from Comeph, Janofer sat 
serenely watching; and presumably 
Skan and Legroeder were some- 
where about. 

That’s the whole cast, Cephean. 
Carlyle turned about, scuffled his 
feet in the turf, breathed great lung- 
fuls of air, and gazed at the almost 
torturously green countryside. Will 
you show me around? he said to the 
cynthian. 

Cephean spat and sputtered in 
perplexity, and finally pawed his 
nose and allowed, Hyiss, ss-all ri- 
ss. He led the way downhill, trot- 
ting on all fours with the riffmar at 
his heels. Carlyle followed him into 
the woods, lost him momentarily, 
and then found him again unconcern- 
edly waiting for him beneath a 
stand of slender, smooth-trunked 
trees. 

Sshtopf. He stopped. The cynth- 
ian sat impassively, his molten eyes 
wide. The riffmar became very still. 
A sound passed through the air like 
a flying shadow, a pure musical 
note. Or was it in his thoughts? 
Carlyle could not tell, even when 
the note was first repeated, and then 
followed by several others of differ- 

32 



ent pitch, and different timbre. 
Notes began to fall like rain, reedy 
mournful sounds, and crystal tin- 
kling belltones, and a shower of 
melohoms, and a skyful of sounds 
for which he had no name. There 
seemed to be no melody. But as he 
listened another kind of pattern de- 
veloped in his mind: visual, of col- 
ors, of blending, sagging clays, of 
red sands tumbling from cliffs; and 
the smell of fresh-cut grass and 
broken cedar. His vision blurred, 
and instead of Cephean he saw a 
community of cynthians working, 
directing riffmar, while the larger 
delmar were busy at construc- 
tion. 

A cacophony of silent thoughts 
and commands made him cringe 
and the vision blurred but he glimps- 
ed a quarm, a circle of cynthians, 
their normal cacophony subdued to 
an intense mumble. Again: cyn- 
thians at study (investigating what?), 
their sparkling eyes gazing into 
oddly shaped crystals. Hum of prob- 
ing thoughts. The vision broke. 

The music-rain slowed, trickled 
wetly, and stopped. He looked at 
Cephean in amazement; the cyn- 
thian now sat beneath a cleverly 
woven bower of trees, looking ut- 
terly relaxed. Carlyle blinked. Had 
the trees themselves bent to Cep- 
hean ’s designs? The music had en- 
gaged him so, he had literally seen 
nothing happen. You did that? he 
whispered. 

Hyiss. 

The visions — had they been a de- 

GALAXY 




liberate distraction, or merely an 
undertone, background noise? 

He never got the chance to ask. 
A boisterous scream shattered the 
forest stillness. He looked around, 
startled. An enormous flying beast 
coasted over the woods and de- 
scended, crashing through the trees, 
and landed on the forest floor 
nearby with a crump. It was a 
koryf, a dragonlike creature from 
Garsoom’s Haven. Carlyle had seen 
one once, and had been terrified — 
as he was now. 

The beast screamed again, and 
spat acid saliva that fell smoking 
among the trees. The creature was 
hideous, crumpled and grey, and it 
stank, even from a distance. 

Whassssl Cephean hissed shrilly. 

Carlyle explained, and added 
quickly that the creature would 
quite likely try to kill them. This 
one came from my memory, he 
thought woefully. 

The koryf beat its wings furious- 
ly, and lurched toward the two with 
a cry like a sigh of death. Carlyle 
back-pedaled further into the trees, 
but Cephean did not move. 
SSTHOFF! his mind shrieked at the 
approaching beast, seemingly con- 
vinced that if a riffmar would re- 
spond, so would a koryf. 

The koryf lunged spitting and 
wailing at the much smaller cyn- 
thian. Cephean fled after Carlyle. 

You can’t stand against it, Car- 
lyle said stupidly, as he huddled 
against a tree. Cephean just glared 
at him. The riffmar scrambled past 



and did not stop. 

Carlyle gestured frantically. We 
can’t outrun it, not far, and we 
can’t fight it. We’ll have to outwit 
it. 

Sss-howl 

It’s stupid, do you understand 
that? It’s telepathic, but it’s stupid. 
The koryf was crashing through the 
trees towards them. His words spill- 
ed out in a jumble. We've got to 
distract it — it can only concentrate 
on one thing at a time. If we each 
try to hold its attentiofi we can con- 
fuse it. Then — jesus, I don’t know 
what then, but if we don’t do that 
much it will kill us for sure. 

Somewhere, Corneph cackled a 
cynthian cackle. 

Hyou bross heem Caharleel! 
Cephean protested angrily, not say- 
ing whether he meant Corneph or 
the koryf. 

Carlyle shoved Cephean violent- 
ly, and scrambled himself as the 
koryf smashed with beating wings 
through the last shielding trees. 
Urging Cephean on, Carlyle stum- 
bled to gain some distance. He 
gasped and leaned heavily against a 
tree as Cephean, beside him, 
snarled at the beast and then turned 
to resume his complaint. 

Carlyle was saved answering as 
Janofer interceded soundlessly from 
wherever she watched. He had no 
choice, Cephean. Carlyle looked up 
in amazement. Gev can only get so 
much help from us, and no more. 
We are not so real as we seem. But 
you can help, Cephean, if only you 



AUEN PERSUASION

will try. Do what he says now — you 
must! Her voice was soft as always 
but urgent. Bitterness and gratitude 
rose in his throat, in his nostrils at 
her compassionate and humiliating 
presence. 

Cephean snorted, but looked off 
into space, thinking, pawing at his 
whiskers. Finally he ducked his 
head around to face Carlyle. Whass 
h-we d-hoo? 

The koryf screamed, as it de- 
ciphered their location and started 
smashing its way forward again. 
Trees began toppling terrifyingly, 
and gusts of foul wind filled the 
woods. 

You run to the right. I’ll run 
left!. Carlyle shouted. You’ve got to 
keep its attention, and I’ll do the 
same, keep it confused. Now GO! 

The tree before them was sud- 
denly unrooted in the koryf s jaws. 
Before it could drop the tree to at- 
tack, Carlyle and Cephean bolted 
in opposite directions. The koryf 
hesitated, and turned to follow .Cep- 
hean, roaring. Carlyle began jump- 
ing and screaming, STOP! STOP!, 
but when the koryf gave no sign of 
listening he took a deep breath and 
charged after it. There were no 
stones on the ground, so as he ap- 
proached the beast he scooped up 
clods of earth and hurled them at 
the koryf s head. He missed, but 
found a broken branch and threw 
that as the koryf snapped close to 
where Cephean crouched. The 
branch glanced from its forehead, 
and it swung about in rage, lifting 



its wings like tree-bowers, and 
screamed at Carlyle. Carlyle turned 
and ran. 

When he had gained a little dis- 
tance, he looked back. The koryf 
had begun following him, but he 
could see Cephean in the distance, 
seemingly stalking the beast. The 
koryf crashed dangerously close, 
and he could smell its acrid breath, 
but he waited, ready to run, think- 
ing, come to me, come to me. An 
image of raw, red meat came un- 
bidden into his mind and he stiff- 
ened, thinking he was intercepting 
the koryf s thoughts, but the koryf 
stopped suddenly, and wavered. It 
twisted its head to look at Cephean, 
and when it did so, Carlyle filled 
his mind with the same image of 
raw meat. The koryf turned back, 
spitting, but did not attack. An im- 
age of a wounded, struggling ani- 
mal appeared, and the koryf turned 
again toward the cynthian. Carlyle 
replied in kind. 

After a minute of confusion, the 
koryf suddenly made up its mind, 
and it charged after Cephean. Car- 
lyle ran after it, hurling dirt and 
branches, and screaming. He had to 
chase it some distance before it 
stopped and turned, and they could 
begin their game of confusion once 
more. 

This time they held it longer. 
Carlyle called encouragement to 
Cephean as they toyed the beast 
back and forth. When the spell fi- 
nally broke, the koryf turned on 
Carlyle and snapped so close he 



34 



GALAXY 




could hear the teeth clack in his ear, 
and he ran and did not stop running 
until he was out of the trees and in 
the meadow. 

Stupid! he realized immediately 
as the koryf broke out of the trees 
right behind him. But Cephean ap- 
peared at the edge of the woods and 
screamed a mental picture of 
bloody, gutted animal. When the 
koryf hesitated, Carlyle hurled a 
stone, and knocked it on the head. 
The koryf vacillated. 

Carlyle thought of a snoring 
mouse, concentrated all his thoughts 
on the image of the tiny, sleepy 
animal. He felt the image rein- 
forced, as Cephean took it up; and 
suddenly the koryf merely looked 
confused. Out of the cover of the 
trees, the beast was as frightening 
as before, but uglier and less mythi- 
cal. Carlyle thought of sleep, of 
peace, of satiation. He imagined 
himself after gluttonous eating, and 
that thought too was reinforced. 

The koryf, after a while, folded 
its wings and settled down to watch 
the two from a more comfortable 
position. It began to look like a 
shriveled, big-jawed elephant minus 
trunk and ears. Lowering its weight 
to the ground, it seemed to decide 
that there was no point in making 
hasty decisions. 

Two minutes later, it was snoring 
loudly and vulgarly, and Cephean 
was studying Carlyle with flicker- 
ing, astonished eyes. 

Janofer smiled from the edge of 
the forest. Corneph appeared also 



and hissed grudgingly. That seemed 
to please Cephean. 

Carlyle was not sure just what the 
cynthian was thinking. But if Cep- 
hean had believed Janofer, did any 
of the rest matter? 

Carlyle lifted his eyes and 
looked across the dreampool with 
unutterable fatigue. His neck was 
cramped, his arms and legs were 
sodden, and he was drenched with 
sweat. He looked at Cephean, who 
was grumbling and stretching with 
far less than his usual energy. 

Carlyle climbed down from the 
ledge. He nodded to the cynthian, 
but neither of them felt like speak- 
ing. 

PART THREE— The Flume 

The last day before Sedora 
reached the end of the Reid, Carlyle 
suddenly found himself taking a lik- 
ing to the riffmar; he whiled an 
hour playfully boxing with them, 
and later, as they were sunning 
themselves under a lamp in the nu- 
trient box, he came around and 
squirted them with a water bottle. 
They giggled hoarsely, and seemed 
to enjoy it. Cephean said nothing 
about this, and Carlyle wondered 
whether it was really the riffmar he 
played with, or an amused cynthian. 
He could not be sure; he rather 
hoped it was the riffmar. 

They practiced once more in the 
net, and Cephean was cooperative 



AUEN PERSUASION 



35 




but unenthusiastic. Carlyle did not 
press the issue. Fortunately, the 
Flume was coming upon them 
quickly, and the time for worry was 
over. They would either make it, or 
they would not. 

Carlyle took a last draught of 
hermit ale, frothy and cooly refresh- 
ing, and then he summoned Cep- 
hean from a last pod of odomolk, 
and led him to the bridge. He could 
not guess at his crewmate’s 
thoughts. 

The net was flushed with a slight 
excess of power, a result of Car- 
lyle’s final retuning of the fluxpile. 
He flexed his spidery wings gently 
to bum off the extra energy. 

Finally he took a last few mo- 
ments to settle himself calmly and 
alertly in the net, and to glance 
about him. The Reid was running fast, 
and grumbling as it accelerated to- 
ward its end. 

Ready? he asked. Hyiss, 
answered Cephean. 

The current became a powdery, 
tumbled ski slope, and they were 
speeding downhill into a snowy, 
evening mist. What lay below was 
obscured. He folded the net beneath 
him into skis, and they thundered 
pleasantly through the snow. He 
flexed and bounced through the 
banks; Sedora was heavy, but so far 
she was riding well. 

There was no way of guessing 
when the vision might change or 
how. Was the cynthian viewing a 
similar scene? Cephean, what do 



you see ? How does it feel? Cephean 
homm-humm’d in reply, and Car- 
lyle caught a stunning glimpse 
through his senses — a fleeting land- 
scape, prismatic and crystalline, and 
dustily wet. And downhill speed, 
growing. Carlyle was reassured. 

H-you wanss chahange, Cahar- 
leel? Cephean queried nervously.. 

No, this is fine for now. Cephean 
was uneasy, then, but seemed alert 
and ready to assist. Little more 
could be expected. 

The speed picked up even more, 
and the snow was turning harder; 
the skis rumbled louder beneath 
him, and began to shimmy and skit- 
ter on the run. The light on the 
snowscape was fading into twilight, 
and he began to lose some of his 
confidence. 

Without warning, he thumped 
into a mogul and was slammed vio- 
lently into the air, his bones quiver- 
ing from the impact, his breath 
sharp and scared. The ship’s mass 
took him off balance and twisted 
him sideways and off keel as he 
fell — and it was Cephean who 
brought them down safely, his 
heavy tail swinging outboard to 
counterbalance Carlyle’s torque. 
They landed hard, skidding and 
swaying, and swooped onward 
down the trail. 

Good work. Thanks. 

Yiss. 

The air began to mist, then, and 
the snow softened under the runners. 
The image was disintegrating; the 
snow wilderness was blurring into 



36 



GALAXY 




fleeting, hazy clouds. And then the 
current dropped, shifted, and turbu- 
lence grabbed at them like vacuum. 

They had been dumped into the 
Flume. 

Carlyle pulled his arms and his 
breath taut, and fought not to be- 
come excited. The ship was plum- 
meting uncontrolled, and he had no 
idea whether he should try to slow 
it or steer it or leave it alone. Ride 
it easy until something deve lopes, 
he called, finding security in the 
sound of the command. Wind was 
rushing deafening at his ears. 

Whass haffenss? he heard in an 
urgent, frightened whisper. 

I'm not sure. 

The turbulent winds were forming 
ahead into visions of glowing 
streamers; chaotic, thundering, furi- 
ously interclashing. Their downward 
fall sloped into forward motion 
again, and an ungodly racket shook 
the ship’s frame until it groaned in 
the buffeting net. Sedora plunged 
toward the center of the fury — and 
something was changing. 

Another vision, Carlyle shouted, 
startled by a new and thunderous 
roar in the net. A noise of crashing 
water threatened to shatter his ears. 
Waterfall! We’ve got to ride this 
one, or it will break us apart! he 
bellowed, not knowing if he was 
heard. 

He dug his arms into the hurtling 
water, felt Cephean doing the same. 
The ship crashed thundering through 
foaming spray, dashed amid shining 



boulders— and shot over the edge. 

It dropped like a cannonball 
(skirting how many light years? 
Carlyle wondered ludicrously). 
Ready to bring the stern about! 
They would have to impact in the 
cataract basin nose-first, or the 
shock would demolish them; but 
they would have to come about un- 
der their own power or the wrench- 
ing turn would accomplish the same 
thing. He would have to lift the 
nose as Cephean kicked the 
stem . 

Sedora slammed into the basin 
like an ungodly pile-driver, an 
exploding jack-hammer, and 
smashed Carlyle’s thoughts and 
teeth and steel neural arms, and sent 
pinwheels of fire through shocking 
darkness. 

Carlyle wrenched before black- 
ing, and Cephean kicked, and the 
ship screamed through its skeleton 
and its skin but refused to yield to 
the torrential currents. Then it bent 
like a maddened porpoise, and rock- 
eted shrieking out of the water- 
cyclone and coasted straight, shiver- 
ing, intact. 

Carlyle forced his eyes to see 
again and gaped in amazement that 
the madness had passed and the 
way ahead lay sparkling, clear — as 
smooth as a river. 

We cleared it! he shouted. 

Hyiss yiss yiss! Where h-we gho? 
the cynthian burbled, still frightened 
and delighted at finding himself 
alive, and open and generous 



AUEN PERSUASION 



37 




enough to let Carlyle see all of that. 

To the Banks, to Cunnilus Banks, 
you sonofabitching cat! he yelled 
joyously at the cat-like being. 

But all was not yet over. Sedora 
still scooted and danced and dashed, 
and Carlyle and Cephean were 
jerked from their delight to hold the 
ship on course, in its pathway 
among scattering and shifting cur- 
rents that were the Flume breaking 
into its upwellings and downwel- 
lings and dying threads of energy. 
The effort was grueling, and the rig 
strained and stretched between the 
two; and once Carlyle shouted an- 
grily and brutally at his alien com- 
panion, and once Cephean in furi- 
ous backlash almost slewed the .ship 
into a sulking dive. But neither 
could have managed alone, and Car- 
lyle drew often on Cephean’s sup- 
port, and even relied on the cynth- 
ian’s vision when his own grew 
blurry in weariness. 

The currents tore at them and 
nagged them, but in the end they 
succeeded, and Sedora hurtled 
coasting out of the shifting winds, 
and Cunnilus Banks glittered before 
them like a starry, snowy hill — 
bright and welcoming after their 
journey. 

Carlyle pointed Sedora’ s nose 
carefully, deciding on Garsoom’s 
Haven. (Gammon’s Annex, the 
original destination, was too far 
abeam, and what the hell, he could 
show Cephean a real live koryf.) 
Then he settled back in the net and 
relaxed, watching the powdery drift 



of the stars and chatting a bit with 
the cynthian. 

Not a bad piece of flying, eh, 
Cephean? 

H-you kidss h-me, whass, yiss, 
Caharleel? Why h-yor ffrens no 
helff? Hi needss broil-damn 
odomilk, iss whass hi needs. 

Ho, you weasel, I think I’ll teach 
you to drink ale. Maybe a spot of 
whiskey, no? 

H-no, yach! H-you ffoison h-me, 
yiss? 

Look at it this way, Cephean, I’ll 
bet it’s something Corneph never 
tried. 

Ssrue, fferhaffs, yiss. 

It’s settled, then. Just to show no 
hard feelings. 

Yorgh. Hey whass? H-yor frenss 
h-again? 

Carlyle, hardly aware of the drift 
of his own thoughts, was as startled 
as the cynthian. 

Janofer, clear and beautiful in the 
net, was staring at the two with 
mock-beady eyes. What’s this, 
Gev? You two are starting to sound 
like old friends; vicious. 

Okay, okay. 

Don’t be embarrassed. It’s nice. 

Yeh. Enough’s enough. Cephean, 
you ready for that ale? (Janofer 
withdrew back into his mind, grin- 
ning.) 

H-you kray-ssee. 

Grinning himself, Carlyle pulled 
gently from the net and rubbed his 
eyes thoughtfully. The road ahead 
seemed clear, and he was ready 
whether Cephean was or not. ★

Only on the Moon 
can you learn what 
‘ homesick ’ really means! 



By a vote of 208-127 the House 
today approved the so-called 
“Moohball Rider” attached to the 
National Lotteries Act (S.1225), a 
bill authorizing the construction of 
a domed stadium at Lunar Base 
Two (Copernicus). Construction is 
scheduled to begin in January, 
1989, at a cost of $8.2 billion. 

Proponents of the measure have 
argued that once the facility is func- 
tioning, the costs will be recouped 
in the first year of operation alone. 
Opponents of the measure, while 
failing to come up with the votes 
necessary to defeat the bill in its en- 
tirety, nonetheless were able to de- 
lay a decision on the financing of 
the 128 ground stations stipulated 
in the bill before the Senate. Recent 
advances in satellite holography are 
credited with assuring the passage 
of the measure, which was defeated 
when first proposed in 1986. 

Thus, what began as simple re- 
creation for the first lunar construc- 
tion crews, will become what one 
Congressional aide called “ a sig- 
nificant source of revenue’ ’ in the 
future. “ Once you’ve seen your first 
moonball shot,” said the aide, 



“ you’ll know what all the excite- 
ment is about.” Senator Steven 
Grange (D-lll.) who steered the 
bill through the Upper House, put it 
more simply: ” Betting on moonball 
will replace sex as the national pas- 
time,” he said. 

The New York Times 
April 11, 1988 

Silas saw the boy first thing. He 
was out against the bam shooting 
baskets, even though it was an hour 
past sundown and the ground was 
still wet. A good sign. Silas pulled 
his mud-spattered Pontiac into the 
little wom-down shelf by the front 
porch where the forsythia was and 
got out, avoiding puddles. 

The boy had spotted him. He 
stood with the ball cradled loosely 
on his hip, watching, as Silas ap- 
proached cautiously, looking at the 
ground, not wanting to get his shoes 
muddy. 

“Howdy.” 

The boy nodded. “Ma’s over to 
the house, watching TV.” 

“It ain’t your ma I came to see,” 
said Silas, smiling. “It’s you.” 

The boy frowned, his pale blue 
eyes blinking rapidly. Silas could 
almost feel the thinking going on 
under the thatch of bright red hair. 
With a detached professional eye, 
he noted the thick legs, the muscu- 
lar buttocks and torso, the stubby 
arms. 

The coach over at Culver was 
right, Silas reflected; The kid 
looked slow as a freight train, and 



40 




he couldn’t have been an inch over 
five-foot-nine. Perfect. 

“I hear you can shoot,” Silas 
said. 

The boy shrugged. ‘‘Are you a 
scout?” 

Without answering, Silas walked 
closer to the basket. The ground 
fronting it was packed so hard it 
was almost playable, even after all 
the rain. And it was a shooter’s 
basket, for sure. The way the 
backboard came out from the bam 
on its rig of two-by-fours, there 
wasn’t enough to drive the baseline, 
and someone making a straightaway 
layup would have to break his 
momentum quickly in order to 
avoid crashing into the side of the 
bam itself. And the apron in front 
of the basket had been worn smooth 
of grass for a distance of about 
thirty feet in all directions. 

Thirty feet. Couldn’t beat that. 

‘‘Play you a game of horse,” 
Silas said. 

The boy smiled, and tossed Silas 
the ball. He fingered its slick, 
grimy surface gingerly, trying not to 
show his distaste. He was a city 
boy himself, had learned his bas- 
ketball on the playgrounds and the 
YMCA courts, where control of the 
ball was all-important, where it was 
dribbling and moves and leaping 
that counted. You had to have a 
ball with some tread left for that. 
Whereas a shooter — 

He threw the ball back to the boy 
and wiped his hands on his pants. 

‘‘Shoot,” he said. 

MOONBALL 



When it was over, Silas turned 
and walked back to the car. The 
boy trailed behind him, curious, 
wondering what was coming next. 
Silas reached into the back seat for 
his gym shoes, put them on with- 
out speaking. The boy watched 
thoughtfully, chewing on his lip. 
“What school you with?” 

“No school,” Silas said, shortly, 
and walked back to the court, 
avoiding puddles. 

“I thought maybe you was from 
State,” the boy said. “They sent 
me a letter and all.” 

‘‘I guess I know what you 
thought,” Silas said. ‘‘But you 
couldn’t play basketball for State 
nor anyone else either, except 
maybe for some rinky-dink junior 
college.” 

He watched the hurt come into 
the boy’s eyes, pleased. It was a 
good sign. It meant that in spite of 
all the countless hours of dreaming, 
the boy already knew that what 
Silas was telling him was the truth. 

“I just whupped you in horse,” 
the boy muttered. “I didn’t miss a 
shot.” 

“You’re a shooter,” Silas agreed. 
Then he allowed some of the 
old contempt to drift into his voice. 
“But you think they’d let you sit 
around the perimeter banging away 
from thirty feet at State? Shit! Be- 
sides, you’ve got about a D-plus 
average, ain’t that right? Ain’t no 
school going to touch nobody with 
a D-plus average. No way!” 

Silas watched the boy worry that 

41 




one around in his mind a bit. Poor 
dumb kid; he’d probably been 
dreaming since he was ten about 
playing for some college, practiced 
from sunup to sunset, watched ball 
after ball settle in the cords, and 
never really got it through his mind 
that you can’t play basketball after 
graduating from high school if you 
can’t move ! Especially if you’re 
barely five-foot-nine. 

“I heard they let you take sum- 
mer courses.” 

“Summer courses. Shit! Take all 
the goddamn summer courses you 
want. You’re still gonna be pitching 
hay next fall for eight bucks an 
hour.” 

Silas watched the hurt come back 
into the boys’s face, but refused to 
let it touch him. Why should he? 
What he’d said had been God’s 
honest truth, and if the boy didn’t 
know it by now, he’d know it in the 
next five minutes, after Silas treated 
him to some sweet old playground 
moves. And it wasn’t as if he’d 
come all the way from Richmond 
just to show the kid up, after all. 
The kid was a shooter. Goddamn, 
was he ever a shooter! He’d drawn 
nothing but twine in ten or twelve 
shots, none of them from closer 
than twenty feet, and that was 
worth something these days. So, 
depending on what happened in the 
next ten minutes, he’d make the kid 
an offer. That much was certain. 
Only question was, how little could 
he get him for . 

“If you ain’t a scout, what are 



you anyway?” The boy was looking 
at the ground now, dribbling the 
ball slowly. 

“Didn’t say I wasn’t a scout,” 
said Silas. “Said I wasn’t with no 
school.” 

He emphasized the last word with 
a meaningful raise of the eyebrow 
but he couldn’t tell if the kid had 
noticed it or not. The ball continued 
to move back and forth between the 
packed dirt and the hand, ringing 
wheezily each time it struck. 

“What then?” The boy risked a 
glance at Silas. “Pro?” 

“How about you let me ask the 
questions?” said Silas. His left 
hand snaked out and grabbed the 
ball in mid-air. The boy looked up, 
blinking. 

“Play you a game of one-on-one. 
To eleven. Winners out.” The boy 
regarded him blankly. “That means 
the same as — .” 

“I know what it means,” said 
the boy. 

Silas took the ball and let it hang 
low to the ground. He watched the 
boy’s thick feet while making 
quick, feinting moves with his 
shoulders. When he saw the open- 
ing he moved quickly, dribbled 
twice, and went in for a layup, un- 
contested. Then he took the ball 
back, waiting fifteen feet from the 
basket while the boy shambled 
over, feinted, and went to his left 
for another layup. The next time he 
went right up the middle with his 
back to the basket and sank a short 
jump-shot.

GALAXY 




“That’s three to nothing,” Silas 
said, smiling. “You playing any de- 
fense?” 

The boy shrugged and slouched 
into position. This time when Silas 
went around him the ball hit a 
bump and he had trouble recovering 
before he flipped in a neat little re- 
verse. 

“You walked,” said the boy, and 
held out his hands for the ball. 

Eleven shots later Silas went back 
to the car and changed his shoes. 
The kid was one helluva shooter. 
Whenever Silas had crowded him 
the kid had just raised the ball over 
his head and lobbed it into the 
basket — even with a hand in his 
face. 

“You like it around here?” Silas 
waved his arm at nothing in 
particular — the rickety house with 
the screened-in porch, the bam, the 
culvert running uphill behind the 
house, the spindly forsythia, the 
sky. 

The boy raised his shoulders a 
fraction of an inch, dropped them. 

“How’d you like to go live 
somewhere else?” 

“Where?” 

“Oh, someplace where there’s no 
birds singing, no ma inside watch- 
ing the TV, no rain, none of 
this . green shit.” 

“New York?” The veil had come 
off the boy’s eyes, and he was 
watching Silas curiously. 

“Naw, not New York.” To his 
surprise, Silas felt himself touching 
the boy, gently, on the shoulder. 



“Place I’m talking about ain’t for 
everybody. There’s some that like 
it, some that don’t. But the money’s 
good, and they got women 
there ...” 

“Where?” said the boy, his eyes 
suddenly bright. 

Silas smiled. He had him. 

“You know damn well where,” 
he said. “Let’s go on in and talk to 
your ma.” 

Abu was having the green dream 
again. 

He was in the air, floating. It was 
like being in a jungle, - or a huge 
clump of cypress, where the trunks 
of the trees were invisible. Over- 
head, the canopy of high branches 
and leaves formed a kind of dome 
which curved suddenly to a short 
horizon. It was dark in there, 
greendark and quiet. He could not 
see the sun or sky. 

He floated over to where the 
sides curved down. In deep slow- 
motion he descended, touched 
ground lightly, then was up again. 
He strained upward, as a diver com- 
ing out of his tuck reaches for the 
water. 

He had never reached the top; 
gravity caught him this time too, 
snared him in its invisible loop, 
braked him, brought him down. He 
watched the canopy recede, then 
landed crouched on all fours. This 
time he felt the power surging in his 
legs, felt the correctness of the tim- 
ing, the dream-like explosiveness of 
the leap. Upward he soared, toward 



MOONBALL

the dome which trembled and chit- 
tered in an unseen wind. 

He knew he would reach it this 
time. This time he would bury his 
head in all that green witchery, 
laughing like a child again, and sing 
some of the old music before he 
came down. 

Hi-eeya epaduma wadda h’rumba 
toi . 

May my spirit assume the aspect 
of tall grasses . 

But when he reached the top he 
went straight on through. 

The woman heard him waking. 
She climbed down from her bunk, 
went to the pipe and filled it. 

“This time I was released,” he 
said in his peculiar, singsong voice. 
“Always before I have been unable 
to come to the top. Always before I 
had thought only to feel the leaves 
before surfacing again. Even in 
dreaming I have understood that one 
must always surface.” 

“Dreams are funny,” she said. 

“I had great velocity,” he said. 
“It was unexpected. I saw this 
moon when I came through.” 

“Dreams are funny,” she re- 
peated, not knowing what else to 
say. She sensed his puzzlement, 
knew that for him a dream was a 
gift from the spirit world, a portent, 
perhaps a warning. A man must 
consider it, stalk its meaning like a 
hunter. Or it would end up stalking 
him instead. 

She, on the other hand, was from 
Philadelphia. 

The pipe was out. She took it 



from him, went to the jar, saw that 
they were almost out of kief. She 
would have to tell Sheffield in the 
morning. 

“I cannot riddle it,” he said, fi- 
nally. 

“It’s probably just the old 
homesickness taking another form. 
Or maybe it was a way of remind- 
ing yourself that you’re a short- 
timer now. Your contract will be up 
in less than a year. You’ll be going 
home.” 

Abu smoked for a while in si- 
lence. Then he said, “In your coun- 
try the people believe that when a 
man dies his spirit soars upwards, 
into the sky, away from the earth. 
In my country it is understood that 
the spirit instantly plunges into the 
heart of the earth itself, as if it were 
a creature of gravity, just like men. ” 

“What’s all this talk about dy- 
ing,” she chided. “You’d best 
come to bed now. You can puzzle 
on it in the morning.” 

“It was this moon I saw,” he 
said. 

Sheffield greeted moira with a 
smile and perfunctory hug, then 
motioned to the leatherette chair 
in front of his desk. It was always a 
pleasure to see her — especially since 
she called on him infrequently, and, 
unlike some of the others, made 
reasonable requests. Kief for Abu, 
usually, or pills for herself. 

Either of which he could invari- 
ably deliver. As Operations Man- 



44 



GALAXY 




ager he had made a lot connections 
with the people over in Supply, and 
when the shipments came in it was 
only natural that a crate of oranges 
or an occasional steak would find 
their way to his office, to be dis- 
pensed with as he wished. No tell- 
ing how many mutinies had been 
averted by a box of chocolate bars. 

“Let me guess,” he said. 
“Abu’s running out of dope.” 
“Yes,” she said. “He smoked 
the last of it this morning.” 

“That makes twice this month, 
doesn’t it?” 

“It’s him that smokes it,” she said 
wearily. “Not me.” 

“Of course.” He went to the safe 
and returned with a small cel- 
lophane packet, placing it carefully 
on the desk. She made no move to 
pick it up. 

“Is something the matter?” 

Moira drummed her fingers 
against the desk top, hesitated. 

“Yes,” she said finally. “There 
is something the matter.” 
Something in her tone made 
Sheffield pause. 

“Nothing insurmountable, I 
hope,” he said carefully. Moira was 
a veteran, having spent as much 
time on the moon as Sheffield him- 
self, and had witnessed any number 
of . disturbances. Without losing 
her sense of perspective. 

“Please, Moira. You must tell 
me if something is troubling you. 
It’s my job, my responsibility to 
take care of such matters. You were 
about to say . ?” 



“Abu is homesick.” 

“Abu is always homesick,” he 
said, flatly. “What else?” 

“This time it’s different. It’s 
more serious. He’s not getting 
enough sleep. He’s tired, with- 
drawn.” 

“It doesn’t seem to have affected 
his performance. He’s still number 
one on the court.” 

Moira managed a small, wry 
smile. “And he’s about number ten 
in bed. He hasn’t slept with me for 
months.” 

So that’s it, he thought. Oh 
well . he’d had to deal with 
problems of the bedroom many 
times before. In fact, it was an area 
in which he took a special pride. 
All that was needed was some deli- 
cacy, a dash of diplomacy, and a 
slight rearrangement of the accomo- 
dations. Usually it was the players 
who came to him, complaining 
about their women, but even when 
the reverse was true he’d found some 
way of dealing with it. 

“I see,” he said. “Well. You 
and Abu have been together for al- 
most two years now. Perhaps it’s 
time for a change.” 

“A change isn’t going to help 
him,” she said, not looking up. 

“Maybe not. But it might help 
you.” 

Moira looked amused. “Come 
off it, Shef. Since when have you 
really given a damn about me or 
any of the other women up here?” 
“I—” 

“You don’t have to explain or 

45 



MOONBALL 




apologize. I mean we’re both in the 
same line of business, right? Keep 
the boys happy and well-fed and 
well-fucked, and generally see to it 
that they show up on the court 
twice a week.” 

“They are paid — and paid very 
well — for what they do on the 
court.” He sighed. “Look. Of 
course I try and see that their needs 
are met. And that means seeing to it 
that everybody is as comfortable and 
happy as possible under the cir- 
cumstances.” 

“I know, I know.” Her voice 
mocked him, gently. “We are all 
one family up here. We have our 
ups and downs, same as the New 
York Yankees. Jesus, Shef, the last 
thing I need is a pep talk.” 

“I see.” He tried, not very suc- 
cessfully, to assume a business-like 
tone. “What do you need, then?” 
She regarded him bleakly. “Hon- 
est to God, I don’t know. I try to 
remind myself how much we’re get- 
ting paid for all this. I remember all 
those checks piling up back home, 
and I think about the little place I’ll 
get, up on the Hudson Bay. And it 
helps. It helps. I’m an American, 
and money helps.” 

“But it does not help Abu. Is 
that it?” 

She shook her head slowly. 
“When I remind him that he’s prac- 
tically rich enough to buy up the 
whole West Coast of Africa, he 
laughs and says only a fool would 
want to buy a desert.” 

“He has a point,” Sheffield said, 



inwardly cursing the steady, even 
monotonous stream of petty disas- 
ters back home, the perpetually 
gloomy weather and economic fore- 
casts. Sometimes he wished for a 
real, honest-to-God Catastrophe to 
rally the troops around; if only 
California would finally up and 
break off into the Pacific all at once 
instead of in bits and pieces, for 
example, it would make his job a 
whole lot easier. 

“He had a dream last night,” 
said Moira suddenly. 

“Yes?” Sheffield knew all about 
Abu’s dreams. 

“It’s one he’s had before, only 
last night it had a kind of ending. 
And whatever it was, it upset him.” 

“It upset him,” Sheffield re- 
peated drily. In spite of himself, he 
was becoming irritated. It was bad 
enough that he had to bust his ass 
every which way to cope with his 
players’ material needs — seeing to it 
that they had enough food, enough 
dope, enough love so that their 
game didn’t deteriorate. But it was" 
positively maddening to be expected 
to cope with something as impalpa- 
ble as someone’s dream. Particu- 
larly when that someone came from 
West Africa, from a culture as alien 
to him as a quilting society on 
Mars. What was he supposed to do? 
Sit by his bunk and hold his god- 
damn hand? 

“I’ll see what I can do,” he said, 
curtly. 

“What can you do?” Moira 
shook her head mournfully. “The 



46 



GALAXY 




only thing that would help would be 
to send him home for a while. And 
that’s out of the question.” 

It was a statement of fact, but 
Sheffield sensed an undercurrent of 
hope. 

“As you say, it’s out of the ques- 
tion. He still has a year to run on 
his contract.” 

“Ten months. I don’t suppose 
you could find any medical 
reason ...” 

“No,” he said, softly. “He’s in 
perfect physical shape, which the 
whole world can see for itself every 
time he plays. And you know what 
our friend the shrink would say.” 

“What if — ” She hesitated, bit- 
ing her lip. 

“Goon.” 

She drew a deep breath and let it 
out slowly. 

“What if I told you that Abu was 
thinking of killing me last night?” 

^^hen moira left, Sheffield 
went over to the small refrigerator 
and helped himself to a half dozen 
Gelusil tablets, a tumbler of orange 
juice to wash them down. He won- 
dered, for what seemed like the 
hundredth time in the past few 
months, if his nerves were finally 
about to go. 

Jesus H. Christ! 

It was too absurd for words. Man 
wants to kill woman so that 
Washington will be forced to bring 
him back to earth to stand trial. 
Where he will see the grass and 
trees dancing from the window of 



his cell. Man decides not to kill 
woman because he believes her 
spirit will be forced to dwell forever 
in the confines of the moon, always 
a victim of its tiny gravity. Incredi- 
ble! 

Sheffield reached into his desk 
drawer and punched the rewind 
switch on his tape recorder, listened 
glumly to the voices. 

“What do you mean, thinking 
about killing you?” 

“It sounds crazy, but I’m sure 
that’s what was going on in his 
mind. After he’d told me about the 
dream I went back to sleep. About 
an hour later I woke up, suddenly, 
as if I had just discovered a snake 
was in bed with me. I was afraid to 
move. I felt him behind me, staring 
at my neck. He was very, very 
close. I wanted to turn over and 
look at him, but I was terrified at 
what I might see.” 

“You were dreaming. Dreaming 
of snakes, maybe.” 

“No. Because finally I couldn’t 
pretend any longer, and I rolled 
over and looked at him.” 

“And?” 

“He was staring at me. His face 
was cold and empty, colder and 
emptier than it is out there.” (Here 
she had waved a hand, vaguely). 
“It made my flesh crawl.” 

“And that’s it? That’s all there 
was to it?” 

“Then he said, ‘I could not leave 
you to this moon forever,’ and got 
back in his bunk. And that was it.” 
Sheffield jabbed the STOP 



MOONBALL 



47 




switch, slammed the drawer shut. 
The suspicion that Moira was right 
tugged at the back of his mind — an 
irritant — but there was no case 
there, nothing to go on, nothing that 
would satisfy the folks in 
Washington if he decided to rec- 
ommend that Abu be given an ex- 
tended home leave. They would 
laugh in his face, or, worse, they 
might just decide to replace him, as 
if it were his fault that everybody 
this side of the moon was going 
zooey. Operations Managers were a 
dime a dozen, but there was only 
one Abu. 

That was really the key. You just 
don’t send the greatest moonball 
player in history home on a whim. 
Especially not when the U.S. Gov- 
ernment gets twenty-two percent of 
the estimated $50 million that 
changes hands every time he takes a 
shot. And most especially, you do 
not recommend that such an action 
be taken on the strength of the un- 
substantiated word of a con- 
cubine . 

So. His hands were tied. He’d 
mention the incident in his weekly 
report, and send both of them 
around to see the psychiatrist. That 
much, at least, was indicated. But 
he already knew what the psychia- 
trist would say. It was what he al- 
ways said, what Washington paid 
him to say. 

Keep them in their traces, unless 
they're basket cases. 

He wondred, momentarily, if 
Washington had any idea that their 

48 



shrink had begun talking in rhyme. 

The intercom crackled. 

“Yes?” 

“Harmon Ludlow to see you. 
Shall I send him in?” 

Sheffield massaged his temples 
wearily, trying to. collect his 
thoughts. Harmon Ludlow, the new 
kid. One of Silas’ finds. A good 
shooter, but not great. And proba- 
bly not destined for stardom, though 
he still needed to be handled care- 
fully. He’d been in once before, a 
victim of the malaise which affected 
everyone, complaining about the 
food, the women, the cramped ac- 
comodations. Plus the beginnings of 
a genuine attack of homesickness 
once the newness of the surround- 
ings wore off. About what you’d 
expect of a kid away from home for 
the first time. 

“Send him in.” 

The door opened and the young 
man with the thatch of red hair 
came in slowly, stood in front of 
the desk, eyes averted. 

“Sit down, Harmon. Good to see 
you.” 

The boy shifted his feet, blinked 
rapidly, but remained standing. 

“Well. What can I do you for 
this time?” His tone was deliber- 
ately casual. He sensed something 
coming, something heavy and de- 
pressing, and he wanted to 
minimize its impact from the start. 
He nodded again in the direction of 
the chair. 

“I want to go home,” the boy 
said. 



GALAXY 




Sheffield nodded, then pretended 
to be momentarily absorbed in the 
papers before him. “Of course you 
do.” 

“You don’t understand.” The 
boy slumped in the chair, buried his 
face in his hands. “I just can’t 
stand it up here no more.” When 
Sheffield said nothing, he hurried 
on. “You’ve been real nice to me, 
everyone’s been real nice. But I 
can’t take it any more. It’s worse 
than prison, no matter what they 
say. And I just can’t take it any 
more.” 

The real despair in his voice 
stabbed at Sheffield, caused him to 
wince inside before answering. He 
had confronted homesickness be- 
fore, in himself as well as his 
players, and prided himself on hav- 
ing successfully immunized himself 
against the dull ache that accom- 
panied it. Now, he felt a mild sur- 
prise that he could still feel pain in 
others. Was it a sign that he was 
losing his grip? 

“Of course you can, Harmon. Of 
course you can.” His tone was 
syrupy, soothing. “Look, if you 
didn’t want to go home at this 
stage — then I’d think something was 
wrong with you. You hurt inside. 
You’d like to be back in West Vir- 
ginia hunting squirrels, or just gen- 
erally fucking off under all that 
wide open sky.” When the boy said 
nothing, Sheffield continued. 
“Everybody wants to go home, 
Harmon. Everybody wants to, 
sometime or other. There’s not a 



man or woman among us who 
hasn’t looked out over all that dead 
land, and seen the earth hanging in 
the sky like a big blue ball, and 
wanted to grab it. Sometimes I 
think it would be better all the way 
around if we were over on the dark 
side, so we wouldn’t have earth in 
our eyes so much, reminding us 
where we came from.” 

The boy sniffled quietly, and 
Sheffield half expected him to wipe 
his nose with his sleeve. There was 
something else. What? 

“It’s that, but it ain’t just that.” 
He paused. “It’s my ma, Mr. Shef- 
field. She’s gonna die before I see 
her again. I just know it!” 

Which means, thought Sheffield, 
that you just suspect it. He breathed 
a sigh of relief. 

“She’s not well, your ma?” 

The boy shook his head, his eyes 
still on the floor. “She’s vomiting 
all the time now. The doctors don’t 
know what it is, and she wants me 
to come home.” He fumbled in his 
pocket and withdrew a tattered sheet 
of blue stationery. “She says so in 
this letter, so I really have to go. ’ ’ 
The innocence of the appeal 
bothered Sheffield. I do what my 
mother tells me. He had a fleeting 
impression of Hannon’s mother, sit- 
ting in her shiny new ranch-style 
house, in a suburb of Charleston 
probably, mooning (no pun in- 
tended) over the loss of her son be- 
tween trips to the bathroom. It was 
a nasty thought, and it irritated him 
that it should have entered his 



MOONBALL 



49 




mind, almost forcing a giggle. 
When he spoke, that irritation was 
only barely concealed. 

“The only thing you have to do, 
Hannon, is to honor your contract 
with the government. Look: I hate 
to be crass, but it just so happens 
that a lot of people down there are 
vomiting these days. In fact, people 
have been throwing up since the 
dawn of mankind, and they have 
usually survived. Now, I’m very 
sorry to hear that your mother isn’t 
feeling well, but you have to under- 
stand that I can’t give everybody a 
pass home just because someone in 
their family is sick. We wouldn’t 
have a player left up here if I did.” 

“She ain’t just sick, she’s gonna 
die!” 

Sheffield sighed sympathetically, 
but his voice was firm. “We’re all 
going to die, sooner or later. Just be 
thankful you’re up here where the 
conditions are sterile, and not down 
there with the rest of them, puking 
your guts out. And while you’re at 
it, you might just say a word of 
thanks to the people who pay your 
salary so you can afford to get her a 
doctor who knows what the hell 
he’s doing, and not some god- 
damned vet!” 

The boy moaned. “She don’t 
need a doctor, she needs me!” 

‘“Well so do a lot of other 
people, including the government of 
the United States of America!” 
Sheffield slammed his hand on the 
desk and the boy’s head bobbed up, 
his eyes wide and blinking. “Look, 



I’ll tell it to you straight, Harmon. 
Nobody gets off this place before 
their time is up! Nobody! And 
there’s a reason for that, and I’ll tell 
you what it is. The government de- 
cided a long time ago to make this 
a pretty damn near ironclad rule, 
because in the early days they did 
allow people to go home on leave. 
And what happened? Half of them 
never showed up for the trip back, 
disappeared without a trace, van- 
ished into the hills where they lived 
on snake and racoon for all I know. 
As for the rest of them — the ones 
who decided to honor their contracts 
and come back — they had to wait 
around in the training rooms until 
their bodies became reaccustomed 
to one-sixth G, sometimes for 
months, until they could finally get 
back on the fucking court and do 
their fucking job!” 

“You don’t have to scream at 
me,” the boy said, cringing. 

“I’m glad to hear that, Harmon. 
I don’t like shouting at people, 
especially my players, because I am 
here to serve you as well as the 
government, and I take my job seri- 
ously. But I cannot tell you, I can- 
not tell you how sick I am of 
people coming to me and demand- 
ing that they be allowed to go 
home. I’m tired of being threatened 
that such and such will happen if 
they are not given an immediate 
leave of absence, and passage on 
the first ship out. Only this morn- 
ing, a woman came to me and told 
me that her man had threatened to 



50 



GALAXY 




kill her, that he came this close to 
actually strangling her to death. 
And do you know why? Because he 
figured that I would have to send 
him home, because we have no 
courts up here, no trials by jury on 
the moon.” 

The boy nodded slowly. “Abu’s 
woman.” 

“Let’s leave names out of this. 
The thing I want you to understand 
is this: it would have done him no 
good! And why? Because I would 
have found a way to cover it up!” 
He paused, letting the lie sink in, 
hoping that the boy believed him, 
surprised at his own audacity. 
“Yes! That’s right! I would have 
found some way to have it declared 
an accidental death. Do you follow 
me? It would not have worked! 
Murder would not have worked, 
Harmon! Murder. That’s how im- 
portant it is to me and the govern- 
ment, the folks back home in 
Washington.” 

For a long moment the boy said 
nothing. Then: “It must have been 
Abu.” His voice was sullen, resent- 
ful. “You’d let a nigger kill a white 
woman and get away with it. Just 
on account of he makes you so 
much money.” 

“It wasn’t Abu,” Sheffield said 
quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. He 
felt momentarily off balance, cursed 
himself for having brought the sub- 
ject up at all. “But as long as you 
bring him up ... Yes. He wants to 
go home as much as anybody else. 
And yet I ask you: here is a man 

MOONBALL 



who was discovered six years ago, 
pitching peanuts — peanuts — into a 
tin can somewhere in Africa, and 
making bets with an occasional 
tourist. All around him, everywhere 
he looked, people were starving and 
swatting away the flies, blistering 
under the sun. And so was he. To- 
day, he is the best-paid athlete in 
the world. And tonight, Harmon, 
this very evening, you are going to 
jump center against him, and in the 
course of the game a hundred mil- 
lion people are going to bet billions 
of dollars while both of you try to 
put a ball through a hoop, and you 
tell me you’d rather be home watch- 
ing your mother puke, and he tells 
me he’d rather be back in Africa 
pitching peanuts and scratching his 
ass while the rest of his country 
dries up and blows away! Well, I 
don’t want to hear about it! It 
doesn’t make any sense, and I just 
don’t want to hear about it! Not 
from you, or him, or anybody else! 
Do you understand me?” 

“I just want to go home,” the 
boy said, his voice trembling. 

“Well you can’t go home!” 
Sheffield shouted. “Get that 
through your thick head! You can’t 
go home until your contract expires, 
and that’s all there is to it!” 

“Please don’t yell at me.” It was 
almost a whisper. 

Sheffield stood and came around 
the desk. His legs felt weak, and he 
had difficulty controlling his voice. 
“Get out. And don’t come back un- 
til you’ve thought about what I 



51 




said. Then we’ll sit down and talk 
about this like reasonable men.” 
When the boy was at the door he 
turned to Sheffield. His face was 
flushed, angry. “This place 
stinks,” he said. “And I don’t care 
what you say. I’m going home.” 

Abu was early. The training 
room with its dank smell and the 
gleaming chrome tables and exer- 
cise machines was empty except for 
Cooper, the goalie. 

“How’s it going, Champ?” 

Abu smiled in return, stripped, 
and pulled on the red uniform with 
the blue and white numerals and the 
emblem of the hawk gliding over 
the moon’s horizon. The uniform 
was stiff, but a couple of good 
stretches would work out the kinks. 
Then it would feel comfortable,’ like 
a second skin. 

Wearing it always reminded him 
of snakes. He liked that. He thought 
of snakes, slow and powerful, 
coiled in the sun. 

“Run their butts off,” Cooper 
said, as Abu headed for the court. 
“Shoot their goddamn eyes out.” 

In the arena, he went over to the 
rack and fetched a ball and returned 
to the center of the court and 
jumped. He went straight up, 
maybe a dozen feet, then settled 
down again, his slippers gripping 
the Vel-Tec surface with its tiny, 
uncountable bristles. Above him 
curved the huge invisible dome, like 
the night eye of a frog against its 
backdrop of black space, and stars. 



He went higher the second time, 
hanging in the air at twenty feet, 
scanning the short horizon. There 
was enough light, earthlight, to dis- 
cern the ghostly, pitted surface, the 
dead blistered hills rising and fall- 
ing, sloping towards the horizon 
where the full earth hung, waiting. 
He stayed like that for a moment, 
watching, and then came down. 

Cooper came out, loped over to 
his position by the goal, and sig- 
naled that he was ready to start the 
warmups. Abu jumped, and slowly 
rose, holding the ball loosely at his 
chest. At the top of his leap he 
feinted, watched. Cooper leave his 
feet, rising to protect the goal. He 
waited until he was halfway down 
before he shot. The ball come off 
his fingertips nicely and arched to- 
wards the goal, fifty feet away. 
Cooper reached the height of his 
jump much too soon, hopelessly out 
of position. Descending, he watched 
the ball cleave through the air and 
settle with a lazy, whipping motion 
in the back of the net. 

“Shoot their eyes out, Champ.” 

He missed his next two shots, 
then called for a high pass. Cooper 
floated the ball in a flat arc upward, ( 
then crouched, waiting to defend 
the goal. Abu took the pass on the 
ascent, released it almost im- 
mediately. The goalie judged its 
flight, leaped. He was in good posi- 
tion this time, but the ball had too 
much arc on it, coming down at an 
impossibly steep angle, like a mor- 
tar shell, langorous, consuming 



52 



GALAXY 




time, as if its momentum had been 
magically retarded. It barely rippled 
the net in passing. 

“Shoot their goddamn eyes out,” 
Cooper chuckled. 

When the others came out for 
their warmups, Abu left the court 
and followed the narrow corridor up 
to the observation deck. Behind him 
was the arena, with its small, 
brightly colored figures going 
through the pre-game ballet, its 
cameras and technicians making 
ready for the evening’s broadcast, 
and the gamblers, moving into posi- 
tion behind the small betting con- 
soles, punching up the pre-game 
odds, laughing and sipping drinks, 
watching the lazy activity below. 
Before him, suspended over the 
pale dead hills, was Earth, a blue, 
unreachable dream. He sat, cross- 
legged, in a chair facing the hori- 
zon, and waited for the old music to 
come. 

T’abu suya vahanu wa'ena toi, 
he sang, softly. 

Ta mo’ bah vahana lamha 

Lapo rizha sum 

Na lapo doy’ha hri. 

In death, may my spirit seek the 
earth’s center 

As the moonball seeks the center 
of the net. 

Let it go straightly. 

Let it not be fooled by this old 
moon. 

Silas ignored the sign informing 
him that the Tidewater Moonball 
Facility was a kilometer ahead and 

MOONBALL 



swung the Pontiac off the Interstate 
and down the ramp into a seam of 
dark and quiet running parallel to 
and below the traffic. This close to 
gametime it was all bumper- 
to bumper up above as automobiles 
jockeyed for position to get into the 
parking lots that ringed the stadium. 
Which was just fine if you hap- 
pened to like paying ten bucks for 
the privilege of having your car be 
there when you got out. 

On the other hand, if you were a 
gambling man you approached the 
stadium from the rear and made 
other arrangements. Which meant 
traversing about ten blocks of dimly 
lit streets at an even fifty k.p.h. 
with the windows rolled and your 
eyes glued to the road so that you 
didn’t accidentally run over some 
kid and start a riot. 

That was the hairiest part. There 
was no light to speak of; the high- 
intensity lamps which now attracted 
knots of black-skinned teenagers 
had long ago been snuffed out by 
stone or pistol shot, and the sham- 
bling houses which lined the streets 
were mostly dark and abandoned- 
looking, being inhabited now by an 
army of squatters who had to en- 
dure the floodwaters which swal- 
lowed half of Hampton every fall. 
(When that happened, Silas took the 
Interstate and paid his ten bucks 
like everybody else.) 

As he came within two blocks he 
could see the dome of the stadium, 
rising like a bright lilac bubble 
above the darkened roofs, occupy -

ing its own man-made hill, seem- 
ingly in deference to the notion that 
man must have his recreation even 
when he is drowning. But it was 
beautiful, like an amethyst glowing 
in a nest of diamonds and flashing 
pinpoint rubies, or the electric 
palace he’d dreamed of as a kid. 

And it was beauty that was at the 
heart of moonball in the first place, 
as indispensible to pleasure as the 
gaming itself. Inside the arena or 
out, it was the visuals that hooked a 
man; it was beauty’s talon that pulled 
him away from the racetracks 
and the backroom poker games, 
beauty that set a man to dreaming 
moonball and its slow ballet, as 
luminous and unsettling as a hal- 
lucinogen. His pulse quickened as 
he glanced at the dashboard clock. 
Fifteen minutes to the buzzer. He’d 
have to huny, and hope his usual 
boy was there. 

Near the end of a dead-end street 
he braked and pulled the car onto 
what had once been somebody’s 
front lawn. He flashed his lights 
twice and waited, motor running. A 
movement on the porch, black 
against black, and a form appeared 
out of the shadow at his window. 
He recognized the teeth. Jake. 

He left the keys in the ignition 
and got out. 

“Be lucky,’’ Jake said, sliding 
behind the wheel. 

“Luck has nothing to do with 
it,” Silas said. “See you at elev- 
en.” 

As was their custom, Jake let him 



get a respectable distance up the hill 
before throwing the Pontiac into re- 
verse and peeling off down the 
street to commence, most likely, 
a two-hour crosstown orgy. But what 
the hell. It beat paying the bastards 
for parking. 

At the entrance to the lobby he 
flashed his season pass and was 
waved through, then found himself 
squeezed into a tangle of flesh at 
the concession stand, where he had 
to wait five minutes for a beer. 
Around him the crowd surged and 
shouted; animated discussions 
everywhere. It was the controlled 
kind of bedlam which made you 
think of a cockfight, or the crowd at 
a hai a lai game. To Silas it felt 
like home. 

The lobby itself was a 
horseshoe-shaped enclosure, bright 
and plush, which hugged the arena 
on three sides. Tiers of flashing 
wall-monitors ran from floor to ceil- 
ing, indexing the pre-game odds. 
He gave them a cursory look. The 
Hawks favored by four goals over 
the Eagles, Abu a three-goal choice 
to take individual scoring honors. 

And then more numbers, numbers 
setting the prices on the auction 
bidding and the pools, numbers 
which he never even bothered to 
read. A man could get lost in the 
endless combinations of moonball 
betting; experience had taught him 
to keep things simple. Numbers 
were seductive; a betting console 
was access to a living system whose 
blood was number, and a means af- 



54 



GALAXY 




fecting it. Press a button and the 
numbers change, everybody’s num- 
bers. 

It was hard not to play with 
power like that. 

As he moved up the ramp to- 
wards his booth Silas felt his nerves 
calming, his mind moving into a 
state of alertness, and just to keep it 
that way, he popped a meth-tab into 
his mouth and washed it down with 
a careful sip of beer. 

Now and then he recognized a 
face, nodded, but did not speak. 
Crowds he could do without, or 
people, for that matter. Which was 
one of the reasons be had allowed 
himself the luxury of buying a sea- 
son ticket in one of the private 
booths that circled the arena, a pock- 
et of silence where he could think, 
without distractions. Concentration: 
that was the key to a profitable 
evening of moonball. Because when 
a shot was thrown up, you had be- 
tween one and five seconds to de- 
cide if it was on target, and the 
more your mind wavered the longer 
it took to punch up the correct bet. 
The longer you waited the more the 
odds shifted downward and the less 
money you made. It was that sim- 
ple. 

He entered the booth just as the 
National Anthem began. A quick 
glance told him the reception would 
be good, as usual. The holograph 
signals originating in Copernicus 
were relayed through satellite to 
ground station, and occasionally 
they had to fight through a storm, 



became twisted beyond recognition. 
But not now. All was as it should 
have been: perfect. 

He draped his jacket over the 
back of the chair and inserted his 
card in the betting console. It 
hummed, suddenly alive. Below him, 
holographed in the screen, was the 
court, a rough oval running eighty 
feet from goal to goal, a field of 
green under the curving dome 
where the night stars twinkled. 
Eight small figures stood at its cen- 
ter, hands clasped lightly behind 
them as they stared at the flag. 

It was hard to think of them as il- 
lusions, but that was what they 
were: massed intensities of light and 
color one-third their actual size. 
Beauty, that was the only word for 
it. Sheer motherhumping beauty that 
burned holes in your eyes to your 
brain. 

As the Anthem concluded and the 
players loped over to their benches 
for a last-minute conference, Silas 
suddenly frowned. His eyes raked 
the court. Where the hell was Har- 
mon? 

Quickly he punched up the injury 
report. 

LUDLOW. NO START. STOM- 
ACH UPSET. MAY SEE LIMITED 
DUTY. 

He groaned. Damn! The kid was 
usually as healthy as a cow, not to 
mention the fact that you weren’t 
supposed to get sick up there in the 
first place. Nerves, maybe, or else 
an incipient kind of melancholy 
which, according to the sports 



MOONBALL 



55 




pages, was making its rounds more 
frequently among the athletes. 

He sat down glumly, closed his 
eyes — and finally felt the methedrine 
going to work, opening up the 
synapses, flooding the brain with 
protein. He exhorted the cells: 
“Fire, you little bastards, fire!” His 
teeth began to grind, a sure sign 
that the drug had taken effect. 
Meth: there was nothing quite like 
it. 

He heard the buzzer and opened 
his eyes. Gametime. 

The ball shot up from the center 
hole on its column of compressed 
air, and right off the bat Abu at- 
tempted a shot on goal, swimming 
upward to take the toss at its high- 
est point and releasing it the same 
instant, while everyone and his 
mother was expecting a pass to the 
forward in the attacking zone. 

And the shot looked true from 
where Silas was sitting. He couldn’t 
have asked for a better angle, the 
ball curling through the air almost 
head-on — but at the last moment he 
decided to pass up the bet. His rule 
of thumb was if you’re even a 
half-second late in reading a shot, 
lay off. Hojd back until you know a 
shot’s coming. Anticipation was ev- 
erything; then watch the curve of 
the shooter’s hand or the set of his 
arm in the follow-through. Check 
the goalie’s position and the height 
of the ball. Figure out how 
everyone else is betting. And, most 
important, get your own money 
down in less than three seconds, 



when the odds are longest. 

A groan from the crowd, a few 
scattered cheers. The Eagle goalie, 
at the last instant, had tipped the 
ball away. 

Silas allowed himself a small, 
self-congratulatory smile. 

He decided to pace himself, wait 
for the opening — and then come on 
like gangbusters. 

At the first time-out he lit a 
cigarette. Instant buzz. Mixing 
nicotine with meth was a lot like 
adding lead to gasoline; it boosted 
the cerebral octane perceptibly. His 
body tingled sweetly, like a finely 
tuned machine. His brain whirred. 
So far so good. He was ahead 
twenty bucks, and while that wasn’t 
a whole hell of a lot, it beat being 
twenty in the hole. And Abu, after 
that first miss had sunk his next 
three, which meant that the odds 
were bound to get longer a& 
everyone waited for the law of av- 
erages to catch up. 

But sometimes they didn’t, and 
that was all the opening he would 
need. 

His eyes strayed to the Eagle 
bench. Seated at the far end, his 
hands clasped together as if in 
prayer, was Harmon Ludlow. Shot 
full of dramamine, no doubt, but at 
least he was out. 

And then a pleasant surprise. At 
the buzzer the boy slapped Number 
Six on the rump and trudged out to 
center court, his steps even in that 
bewitched gravity somehow slow 
and ponderous.

GALAXY 




Alright! Time for some action! 
Silas smothered his cigarette and 
leaned forward, mind racing, his 
fingers poised lightly at the console. 
Was it his imagination, or did he 
actually sense then for the first time 
that something was up? Wasn’t 
there something in the way Ludlow 
converged on Abu in the backcourt 
that suggested purpose, determina- 
tion? 

Maybe. Or maybe it was just 
some of that good old stalking de- 
fense the Eagles were famous for. 

This time two forwards faced off. 

The tap went deep into the 
Hawks’ defending zone. Abu re- 
treated and took it on the bounce, 
whirled, his eyes on Ludlow, six 
feet away and closing. 

For a long second, Abu did not 
move. 

He seemed to be transfixed, 
watching Ludlow’s approach with 
the intense unwavering concentra- 
tion of a cobra following the musi- 
cian’s flute: feet apart and firmly 
planted, his upper body weaving 
slightly, his black gaze fixed. 

The crowd, sensing something, 
hushed. 

Ludlow hesitated, fractionally, 
and appeared to fumble with his 
sleeve. 

That was the moment Abu chose 
to jump. 

It wasn’t a short, passing leap, 
the kind you might expect from a 
man so deep in his own zone, 
someone backed up close to his 
own goal; This was a shooting jump. 



Silas watched, transfixed, as the 
small black man in the bright red 
uniform rose like a flame at the far 
end of the court; and rose: past the 
lower tiers and the middle tiers and 
the upper tiers where even the spec- 
tators had fallen silent; up, to the 
very lip of the dome itself so that 
for one astounding instant it seemed 
as if he must be higher even than 
the goal on the near side of the 
court where the Eagle goalie stood 
flatfooted and helpless, watching in 
open-mouthed amazement as Abu 
let fly the ball. 

They said, later, that it took a 
full fourteen seconds for the ball to 
travel this unprecedented distance. 

The odds were never longer. 
Silas got $500 down in 1.8 seconds. 

There didn’t seem to be any 
reason for Ludlow’s jump. It was 
too late, useless. He came off the 
floor badly, clumsily, lending cre- 
dence to his blubbering assertion la- 
ter, in the courtroom back on Earth, 
that he had never meant to stick him 
so hard and so deep. That he had 
just wanted to come home. But Abu 
came a long way down; it was more 
collision than attack, and the silver 
slashing at the shoulder bit the 
throat instead. 

It had a dreamlike quality, almost 
beautiful. 

The ball descended, homing. The 
air went red. 

And blood and body and knife 
touched down, together, as the ball 
slipped languorously through the 
net, for a perfect score. ★

Gail Kimberly 



A ship from earth is in port to- 
night, and I will go into town now, 
by myself. Ensch went to the sea 
this morning. He’ll be there three 
days, maybe four if this time is like 
the other times, and I’m already 
lonely. 

I should have recognized the 
signs, should have known that it 
was time for him to go again. It’s 
spring here on Peleus. (The year is 
about eleven Earth-months long.) In 
this area we have a cold winter with 
snow and a sudden, breathless 
spring that sweeps in on wet, warm, 
westerly winds. A change of sea- 
sons is one of the signs. 

He woke me before dawn this 
morning, rocking our sleeping 
hammock when he left it, leaving a 
cold emptiness beside me. I looked 
up and saw him standing in front of 
the thick glass wall of our room, a 
dark shape against the mother-of- 
pearl morning. 

“What’s the matter?’’ 

He didn’t turn around when he 
answered. “Sorry I woke you,’’ he 

A NICE GIRL LIKE ME 



said. “I couldn’t sleep.” 

“You’re not sick, are you?” But 
Ensch is never sick. He’s one of the 
two physicians in our little town but 
he’s never very busy; Peleans are a 
healthy race. 

He turned and smiled down at me 
then, his teeth gleaming white 
against his dark blue skin. “No,” 
he said, “just want to be up and do- 
ing something.” 

That restlessness is another sign, 
but I still didn’t guess what it 
meant. Ensch couldn’t eat and wan- 
dered through the house and the 
garden aimlessly for a while until 
he suddenly said: “I’m leaving for 
the sea now, Judy. See you in a 
few days.” And just that quickly he 
had packed a small bag and was 
gone. 

It’s best that he doesn’t linger. 
He knows how much I would like, 
to be going with him and so he 
avoids the tears and sad goodbyes. 

Now I’ve tidied the house and 
eaten my evening meal in the gar- 
den and turned the ambisound up 

59 




high so the music will fill the emp- 
tiness, but the solitude is awful. I 
must go into town tonight. 

I put on the silver dress and the 
matching silver shoes that I brought 
from Los Angeles, and I go out 
quickly, leaving the tinkling music 
on low to welcome me when I 
come back. I close the glass door 
behind me, the high heels of my 
shoes click down our steep stone 
stairway. 

Halfway down the stairs I pause 
to breathe in the vanilla scent of the 
mysym trees that surround the 
house, thinking that the air in the 
Naked Nymph will stink of smoke 
and the strong, alcohol-laden breath 
of drunken spacers. After a moment 
I go on, smoothing the skirt of 
the dress around my hips. 
Short . they like it short, the 
Earthmen, and it’s uncomfortably 
tight, after the loose, graceful robes 
we wear here on Peleus. 

I remember to walk carefully 
along the stepping-stone path lead- 
ing across the orange expanse of the 
cilia marsh so my heels won’t sink 
into the mud. It isn’t a long walk to 
the Naked Nymph, which is one of 
the reasons I’ve chosen that as my 
place. 

There are other bars in town: 
Randolph’s, and The Oasis, but 
they are farther along Main Street, 
closer to the spaceport, and the men 
who go to them are the eager ones, 
the ravishers, too greedy for sensa- 
tions they haven’t had for all the 
long months in space. 



The gravity here on Peleus is as 
strong as Earth’s; I like to think the 
Naked Nymph gets the gentler ones, 
the ones who have time to stroll the 
streets of our town, to see the 
beauty and the strangeness, taste the 
flavor of life on Peleus first, even if 
for only a little while. But maybe 
that’s just my own private illusion. 
It’s mostly the cargo ships that 
come here, not passenger liners, 
and the spacers who crew them are 
men pretty much of a kind. 

The air is warm over the cilia 
marsh, rising in a fine orange mist, 
and I pull a scarf out of my purse 
and cover my hair so that my curls 
won’t straighten in the dampness. 
The first moon is just rising, outlin- 
ing the row of tall, straight, 
arrow-like trees that mark the 
edge of the marsh. In a few mo- 
ments I walk through the row and 
see our neighbors’ houses on their 
separate little hills; Milom’s glass 
cylinder on the first rise, to my 
right, dark and empty now; Luar’s 
faceted mansion just beyond it, re- 
flecting the silver moonlight on 
three of its walls so that it almost 
seems there are lights on inside. 

Now I climb the steps to Main 
Street, seeing the dark wall of the 
market on one side of me and then, 
at the top of the stairs, the souvenir 
shops across the street. Two of 
them are open, but of course there 
will be only the old men there — 
Joocper and Tanjlr, who no longer 
go to sea. Almost everyone else in 
town has gone, and the street is

GALAXY 




darkened tonight, and deserted, so 
that I can hear the music from the 
Naked Nymph even before I see the 
flashing green sign that shows a 
life-size woman with a shape no 
woman ever had, and the Earthmen 
swarming around the front of it. 

I don’t like the sign. It doesn’t 
suit the place at all, but it pulls in 
the clients, I guess. 

The four men outside the front 
door seem to be arguing about 
something. They have pale skin and 
heavy beards, and they wear dark 
pants and brightly colored shirts, all 
fastened and buttoned and zippered 
and belted on them. Visitors here 
always make fun of the clothing the 
Peleans wear, but none of them 
would change back if they got used 
to the comfort of the robes, as I 
have. 

They stop arguing as I approach 
them, and there are whistles and the 
usual candid remarks about my ap- 
pearance. They watch me push open 
the heavy door, one of them reach- 
ing out an arm to help me, and they 
follow me inside. Drunk, of course. 
All of them. 

They always want me to drink 
with them and I’ve never liked the 
taste or the effect of liquor on me 
or on them. I much prefer the pink- 
leafed herb that Ensch introduced 
me to; that doesn’t affect my speech 
or mobility but produces a lovely 
sensation that lasts as long as I want 
it to, then disappears with a wish. (I 
don’t care for the sensalators. I 
don’t like the idea of probes mess- 



ing around in my brain. Of course, 
I’ll probably use them later on — 
after I can’t do this any more — but 
time enough to think about that 
when it’s necessary.) 

Inside, I cross the thick carpet to 
the desk where Bandal, the owner, 
sits sketching a spacer standing near 
her. He doesn’t know what she’s 
doing, he’s absorbed in conversa- 
tion with his companion, a small, 
thin woman with red hair — 
obviously an Earthwoman. They 
seem interested only in each other, 
probably cohabs on the same ship 
who want to see the sights. 

The Naked Nymph is part hotel 
and part bar, getting its trade, like 
most of the town, from the spacers. 
Bandal has decorated it with brass 
and crystal and shining plastiwood, 
and has hung her own paintings 
around the place — landscapes, 
mostly — the prettier parts of Peleus. 

“That’s a good likeness,” I say 
to her, looking at the sketch. She’s 
caught the attitude and expression 
perfectly. 

“Hi, Judy. Like the usual room 
for tonight? I’ve been holding it for 
you.” 

“Yes, please,” I say, digging 
thirty Pelean credits out of my 
purse. 

“There’s a good crowd in the bar 
tonight,” Bandal says. That means 
there’s mostly men, and I’m happy 
about that. I won’t have anything to 
do with the female spacers, although 
some of them have offered me big 
prices. 



A NICE GIRL UKE ME 



61 




Bandal hands me the room key 
and I drop it in my purse. “You’re 
not at the sea,” I say to her. She’s 
not old, and she’s certainly attrac- 
tive. 

“Tomorrow I’ll go. I couldn’t get 
anyone to stay here for me until 
tomorrow. My uncle will be here, 
from the interior.” Then she smiles 
at me in that strange way she al- 
ways does — as though it hurt her to 
part her lips — and I shrug and turn 
away. She knows I’d give anything 
to be going there myself, but after 
all, you can’t have everything. 

I go on through the raindrop cur- 
tains into the bar. It’s crowded to- 
night, as Bandal said. I can see 
only six or seven women — two of 
them at a table near the curtains are 
Peleans, women I don’t know, 
probably visitors from the interior. 
Both of them are elderly, both 
wearing scarlet and pink robes and 
pink flowered headdresses that 
cover their sparse brown hair and 
frame their blue faces. The other 
women all seem to be spacers. 
There are no other women from 
Earth living here, or anywhere on 
Peleus, that I know of. Except me. 

I go to the bar and sit up on a 
stool, smiling at Vos, the bartender. 
He doesn’t have to ask, but brings 
me the only drink I like, a wine 
they make here that tastes and looks 
so much like champagne they call it 
that. He, too, smiles at me strange- 
ly, sadly, but then he’s a strange 
man. I don’t ask him why he’s not 
away with the others. He has some- 



thing physically wrong with him, I 
believe, and keeps to himself. 

I look over the men in the place. 
A lot of them seem to be too drunk, 
and some seem close to fighting. I 
want to match my partners as 
closely as possible to Ensch’s ap- 
pearance, so I always look for a 
broad forehead, a straight nose, a 
firm mouth and chin — a well-built 
man of medium height. There are 
several here tonight, and one sits at 
the other end of the bar, studying 
me now, so I smile in his direction. 
He has dark brown hair and eyes, 
and is about my age. 

He’s coming toward me now, 
carrying his drink, signalling to Vos 
to bring me another champagne, and 
now he’s sitting on the stool beside 
me. “Hello,” he says, his voice 
confident like his manner. “Mind if 
I sit here next to you?” 

I shake my head. “The seat isn’t 
taken. ’ ’ 

“My name’s Ed,” he says. 
“Judy. I used to know a boy 
named Ed back home.” 

“Where’s home?” 

“Pasadena,” I say, “in Califor- 
nia, the U.S.A.” 

He grins. “I’m from the U.S. 
myself. Greensboro, North Caroli- 
na. Know where that is?” 

“I know where North Carolina 
is, but I’ve never been there.” 

He offers me an American 
cigarette out of a pack labelled 
“Safesmoke” and lights both of 
them, bending close to me. 

“Haven’t been there myself for a 



62 



GALAXY 




couple of years. Going back this 
trip, though.” 

I sip my champagne. “I’ll never 
go home again,” I tell him. 

“Why not?” 

“Space travel would probably kill 
me. Two years ago I came here as 
crewman on a freighter, but I was 
so sick they had to leave me here. 
The two Pelean doctors in town 
here saved my life.” 

“What was the matter with 
you?” His hand pats my shoulder 
as though to erase any pain, and he 
looks concerned. 

“Space sickness was all the 
ship’s doctor could call it. My in- 
sides were all turned around, I 
couldn’t eat or sleep, my brain 
seemed to be crashing around in my 
skull. I was in a coma when we got 
here.” I remember the first thing I 
saw of Peleus, when I finally be- 
came conscious . Ensch’s face 
looking anxiously into mine, his 
brown eyes and hair startling 
against his strange blue skin, his 
long, four-fingered hands cool 
against my forehead. I hope he will 
be only three days at the sea instead 
of four. 

“So you live here?” Ed says, as 
though that’s a fate worse than 
death. He doesn’t know. 

“I like it here.” 

He shrugs. “Want to dance?” 
and we move through the crowd to 
the little patch of glowing floor near 
the ambisound selector that Bandal 
keeps stocked with the most recent 
music from Earth she can get. Ed 



dances well, and when other men 
approach me to dance with them, I 
shake my head and stay with him. 

We go back to the bar and have 
another drink, and I learn that he’s 
26 years old, that he’s got a wife 
and >a son in North Carolina, and 
that he’ll pay 75 credits to go to my 
room with me. 

I like him. He’s intelligent and 
funny, and he does remind me of 
Ensch. 

I take him up to the third floor in 
the tubular glass-walled elevator so 
he can see the second moon rising 
over the cilia marshes, a pretty sight 
that always reminds me of sunset on 
Earth, the two moons so bright they 
set the marshes glowing orange and 
hazy pink and red. 

The room I usually take is #333, 
decorated in a style reminiscent of 
home, with opaque pale yellow 
walls and creamy white furniture, 
and a bright tangerine-colored 
spread on the round bed. Ed doesn’t 
push me right into it. I knew he 
wouldn’t. He kisses my face and 
neck and lips, and ruffles my hair, 
and admires the glass wall that’s 
part of the aquarium the Naked 
Nymph is built around. It’s a gigan-

lingering moment. Then we lie in 
each other’s arms, saying nothing, 
until he gets up from the bed and 
begins to dress himself, opening his 
belt to get the money and lay it on 
the bed beside me. 

“Why are you in such a hurry?” 
I ask him. “Unhappy with me?” 

He smiles down at me and shakes 
his head. “No, I just thought you’d 
be anxious . for another cus- 
tomer,” he says. 

I shake my head. 

“You’re a strange one,” he says, 
getting back into bed beside me, 
pulling me against him. “I thought 
you girls were only interested in 
money, and here you are passing up 
profits.” 

“The money isn’t important,” I 
tell him. “It’s just to pay my ex- 
penses.” 

He doesn’t question me any 
more, in fact, he doesn’t talk much 
for a long time. Now and then I 
watch the sea creatures in the glow- 
ing water and feel as peaceful and 
as placid as they look, their bodies 
caressed by the silky currents, en- 
veloped in nourishing warmth. It is 
only when he falls asleep that I let 
myself think . about Ensch and 
about what he is doing now. 

I can see, in the tank, a long 
coral fish with blue flowers for lat- 
eral fins, as it brushes past the shin- 
ing body of a dolcet, a strange, sil- 
very, mermaid-like mammal with an 
almost human face that seems to 
smile. Ensch, stroked by the cur- 
rents that are the only way of open- 



ing the deep-blue pouch on his 
body, caressed by the warmth of the 
waters of the Mating Sea, approach- 
ing another whose own deep-blue 
pouch has burst into bloom like a 
hungry flower as she spreads her 
arms, waiting. 

I close my eyes against the pain 
and open them again to see the dol- 
cet’s mocking smile against the 
glass of the tank. But it’s only a 
senseless fish, after all, and can’t 
help its smile. There are no fish in 
the Mating Sea, only Peleans return- 
ing to their planet’s womb to beget 
their children, using the short time 
they have only four times each 
year. I wonder who will carry my 
husband’s child, and what it is like 
to feel his passion, that I have never 
known. I can let myself wonder 
now, lying beside this man who 
could be Ensch, who was Ensch to 
me for a little while. And neither of 
us has been cheated, after all. 

It is late when I wake him and 
tell him I have to go home. He goes 
with me down to the lobby and I 
wave to Bandal as I pass, who 
smiles sleepily and waves back. Ed 
walks me out to the street. It is 
empty now, and the moons are cov- 
ered by clouds. “I hope you’ve 
given me a baby,” I tell him. 
“Ensch and I want a baby.” 

He only smiles in a puzzled way 
and watches me as I go down the 
street toward home. He doesn’t un- 
derstand that Ensch and I have so 
much together; and after all, you 
can’t have everything. ★

iTIankind needs frontiers. We 
need new worlds to conquer, im- 
possible odds to overcome, a place 
of escape from bureaucracy and 
government; a place where life is 
hard but the problems are simple, 
requiring no more than courage, de- 
termination, and hard work to win 
great rewards. 

Even for those who will never go 
chasing out to the frontier there’s a 
great comfort in knowing it’s there: 
that you could, if you chose, pull 
up stakes and try your hand at mak- 
ing a new life. For the warriors and 
dreamers among us a frontier is so 
vital that if there isn’t a physical 
one, we’ll create an internal prob- 
lem and fight that. 

I suppose that man’s need for a 
frontier is a debatable proposition, 



in that somebody might question it; 
but I doubt that many science fic- 
tion readers would dispute the 
point. To a very great extent this is 
what science fiction is all about. 

Unfortunately, science hasn’t 
been cooperating with us. First 
comes Special and General Relativ- 
ity to say that we won’t ever travel 
to the stars. Then come the space 
probes to rob us of our traditional 
solar system. What’s left? 

As I’ve said before, I firmly be- 
lieve we’ll overcome the speed-of- 
light barrier, and if we don’t, we’ll 
still find a way to leave the Solar 
System; but that may take quite a 
while, and suppose I’m wrong. Are 
there no frontiers left? 

Venus was once a favorite. Hot 
and swampy, a younger sister of 

65 







Earth, with grey skies laden with 
thick clouds; primordial ooze, scat- 
tered thick forests burdened with 
heavy vines and hanging mosses; 
thick fungus that ate men alive, a 
world populated with strange ani- 
mals, dragons and dinosaurs and 
swamp creatures resembling the 
beastie from the Black Lagoon. 
Venus was a world to challenge us. 

Then the scientists took away our 
Venus, as they had taken away our 
Mars. For a time the extremely high 
temperatures of Venus gave some 
comfort to Velikovsky and his sup- 
porters, and thus argued for a more 
unstable and less orderly Solar Sys- 
tem than we had imagined— we 
could take comfort in fright. In a 
world of cosmic catastrophies there 
is room aplenty for adventure and 
derring-do. 

After all, Dr. V. had predicted 
that Venus would be very hot, pos- 
sibly even still molten from her 
fiery birth from Jupiter; but, alas, 
even that is denied us. Pioneer 
looked down on Jupiter and found 
that he is not even solid. The Queen 
of Heaven does not resemble her 
mythological father, no, not in the 
least. 

Velikovsky would have hydro- 
carbons (and carbo-hydrates) in 
the Venerian atmosphere, and he 
may well be right; but mostly there 
is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in fearful 
amounts, diluted with sulfuric and 
hydroflouric acids. Here and there 
may lurk clouds of ice crystals and 
water vapor, but mostly there is a 



poisonous and corrosive brew pres- 
sing down with 90 atmospheres on 
Aphrodite’s face. 

Venus does not seem an attrac- 
tive place. 

When i was a boy I read a 
“juvenile” novel so utterly forget- 
table that I recall neither plot nor ti- 
tle nor author nor characters. One 
incident in that book impressed it- 
self in my mind. 

The heroes had stranded them- 
selves in the Arabian (or Moroccan 
or Tunisian or Saharan) desert, and 
were about to be engulfed by wild 
barbaric tribesmen on camels — 
when lo!, the tribesmen retreated in 
panic, driven away by the sight of a 
regiment of British Tommies in full 
uniform. 

There were, of course, no British 
troops for hundreds of miles. The 
author made a point of explaining 
that this sort of mirage happens 
quite often in the desert. I re- 
member looking for one many years 
later; it’s true enough. 

There are numerous stories of 
ghost cities in the Mediterranean. 
One can often be seen across the 
straits of Messina: a full city, with 
moving traffic, nestled onto the dry 
and barren hills. The illusion has 
been observed and commented on 
for at least three thousand years. 

What happens is that changing air 
densities will affect light rays so 
that under the proper conditions the 
image is refracted over the horizon. 



66 



GALAXY 




A British regiment marching in 
Aden is seen a hundred miles away. 
Ghostly images of cities form on 
barren shorelines. 

This is rare on Earth. On Venus 
it’s inevitable. The Venerian atmos- 
phere is so thick that light is re- 
fracted through 90° and more. The 
whole planet is visible from any 
point on the surface. The explorer 
will seem to stand in the bottom of 
an enormous bowl, with cliffs tow- 
ering high above him. 

This doesn’t have a lot to do with 
the subject of this column, but it 
fascinates me. Venus must be a 
confusing place, where one sees the 
back of one’s own head spread 
about on the top of an enormous 
cliff. 

The mirages might be worth see- 
ing, but there’s not a lot else to at- 
tract colonists or tourists. Carl Sa- 
gan, Cornell U’s resident genius 
and expert on Venus, once said 
“Venus is very much like Hell,” 
and a glance at Table One shows 
why. 

It’s not a very attractive place to 
live. In fact, a more useless planet 
is hard to imagine. What good is a 
lump of desert whose surface tem- 
perature is up there about the melting 
point of lead, whose atmosphere is 
too thick, with winds of fearful ve- 
locity and force blowing dust across 
craters and jumbled structures like 
the surface of the Moon? 

Some writers have proposed that 



since we can never visit Venus (and 
wouldn’t want to if we could), we 
should make her the Solar System’s 
garbage heap. Venus could become 
the repository for all the long-term 
radioactive wastes produced by nu- 
clear power plants. It’s cheaper to 
drop a load onto the surface of 
Venus than to send it into the Sun, 
and what other use do we have for 
Hell anyway? 

Quite a lot, actually. Venus is 
very likely to become the first ter- 
raformed planet. In fact in a few 
hundred years there may be more 
people living on Venus than live on 
Earth right now. 

The asteroids can be one frontier 
for the future, as I described a 
couple of issues ago; but they’ll 
never be developed into a New 
World. That’s reserved for Venus. 

Not only can we terraform Ve- 
nus, but we could probably get the 
job done in this century, using 
present-day technology. The whole 
cost is unlikely to be greater than a 
medium-sized war, and the pay-off 
is enormous: a whole New World, a 
frontier to absorb adventurers and 
the discontented. Few wars of con- 
quest ever yielded a fraction of that. 

Hardened veteran SF readers will 
have recognized the title of this col- 
umn as coming from a 1955 AS- 
TOUNDING novelette by Poul An- 
derson. His “The Big Rain” should 
rank with all the other successful 
predictions by SF writers: when the 
Big Rain comes, we can live on 
Venus.

The Venerian atmosphere consists 
mainly of carbon dioxide plus some 
other junk that we’d like to get rid 
of. The junk is water soluble, and 
will wash away when we get the 
rain to fall. 

That thick CO2 blanket is the 
cause of all Venus’s troubles. Solar 
radiation comes in, a lot of it as vis- 
ible light and hotter, into the ultra- 
violet. It penetrates into the atmos- 
phere and is absorbed. Now Venus 
slowly rotates, until she faces the 
absolute black of outer space, a 
pretty chilling experience as anyone 
who’s camped out in high moun- 
tains knows. 

The absorbed radiation tries to go 
back out into space, but it has 
cooled off somewhat, from ultra- 
violet to infra-red. IR is absorbed 
nicely by carbon dioxide. The heat 
never gets back out, and up goes 
the Venerian temperature. This is 
called “the greenhouse effect” and 
works on Earth as well as out there. 
In fact, there are theorists who 
wonder if burning all those fossil 
fuels won’t, in a couple of genera- 
tions, loose so much CO2 into our 
own atmosphere as to bring Earth’s 
temperature up sharply. The result 
would be melting ice at the poles, 
and the drowning of most of our 
sea-coast cities. 

Before we get too alarmed at 
that, though, there’s something else 
to worry about: it seems that far 
from rising, the average temperature 
of the Earth is falling, and we may 
be due for a new ice age, complete 



with glaciers in North America and 
like that, within the next hundred 
years. More on both subjects at 
another time; this month we’re con- 
cerned with reducing the Venerian 
fever to manageable levels. 

We need to break up that thick 
CO2 layer around Venus. This will 
automatically liberate oxygen, a 
rather desirable (to us) side effect. 
It will also chop down the atmos- 
pheric pressure to something tolera- 
ble. 

Breaking up CO2 is a rather sim- 
ple task. Plants do it all the time. 
We’ll need a pretty rugged plant, 
since the atmospheric temperatures 
of Venus range from below freezing 
to live steam, but fortunately one of 
the most efficient CO2 converters is 
also one of the most rugged. 

In fact, it’s generally thought that 
the blue-green algae were responsi- 
ble for Earth keeping her cool and 
not getting covered with a thick 
CO2 blanket like her sister. 

The algae will need sunlight, wa- 
ter, and CO2. There’s no question 
about finding those on Venus. The 
temperatures are all right, too, at 
least in the upper atmosphere where 
we’ll seed the algae. 

This isn’t just theory. “Venus 
jar” tests have shown that blue- 
green algae thrive in the best repro- 
duction of Venerian atmosphere we 
can make. They break down the 
CO2 and give off oxygen at ever- 
increasing rates. In fact, to the al- 
gae, Venerian conditions are not 
Hell but Heaven.

We have the algae, and we can 
build rockets to send them. About a 
hundred rockets should do the job. 
Say each rocket costs 100 million 
dollars, and the ten billion dollar 
price doesn’t seem unreasonable. 
Say we’re off by a factor of ten, 
and we’ve a hundred billion, less 
than wars cost; and out of that 
much money we should be able to 
get a couple of manned Venus-orbit 
laboratories as a bonus. It will be, 
after all, a once-in-evolutionary- 
lifetimes opportunity. 

Once the algae are sprayed into 
the upper atmosphere, they happily 
eat up CO 2 and give off oxygen. 
They have no competition. Nothing 
eats them, and there’s plenty of 
room for expansion, plenty to eat, 
and lots of sunlight. 

Some calculations indicate that 
within a year of the initial infection 
the surface of Venus will be visible 
to Earth telescopes. Meanwhile the 
algae go on doing their thing. The 
atmosphere clears. Sunlight coming 
in begins to radiate back out. The 
atmospheric temperature falls, and 
lower levels are invaded by the al- 
gae. 

There is about 100 inches of pre- 
cipitable water in the Venerian at- 
mosphere. This means that if it all 
fell as rain, it would cover the en- 
tire surface to a depth of 100 in- 
ches. 

Compared to the miles of water 
covering most of the Earth this is 
not much; still, 100 inches is re- 
spectable. Mars has only 10 mic- 



rons of precipitable water. 

As the air above Venus cools, 
rain-drops will form and eventually 
it will rain, and rain, and rain. The 
first planet-wide storm probably 
won’t ever get to the surface; the 
rain will evaporate long before that. 
But as it evaporates it cools still 
another layer of atmosphere, and 
down move the algae. 

Repeat as needed. In no more 
than twenty years from Go, the Big 
Rain will strike the ground. Craters 
will become lakes,. Depressions 
will become shallow seas. Rivers 
will begin carving channels. 

And as Venus slowly turns, there 
may be snow on the night side: a 
water-table will develop. Deserts a 
billion years old will turn to mud. 

At that point the surface will be 
tolerable to humans with protective 
equipment — the seeding can begin. 
Scientists will want to move very 
carefully, introducing only the right 
plants and insects, fearful lest an 
unbalanced ecology result. Opposed 
to this slow and careful approach 
will be the colonists who want the 
job over and done with. 

Some will demand that we dump 
a little of everything we can think 
of onto Venus and let competition 
take its course; an ecology will re- 
sult inevitably, although we may 
not be able to predict what it will 
be. 

There will also be tailored or- 
ganisms. Microbiologists are al- 
ready to the stage of switching 
genes from one species to another, 



70 



GALAXY 




and it shouldn’t be long before this 
is done with higher plants and ani- 
mals. 

After all, Venus will have special 
conditions. That long rotation 
period means severe winters, like 
the Arctic tundra or worse. Much of 
Venus may resemble Siberia or the 
North Slopes of Alaska, which, if 
you haven’t seen them, are second 
only to Antartica as candidates for 
the most desolate spots on Earth. 
On the other hand, Venus will still 
have a thick atmosphere, and she’s 
closer to the Sun. We don’t know 
what the final temperature will be, 
or how much heat-pumping the at- 
mosphere can do. 

It may not be the most pleasant 
world imaginable. Some writers 
have speculated that Venetian col- 
onists will be nomads, staying on 
the move to live in perpetual sun- 
shine. Others have described a 
world of paired cities connected by 
rails: as sunset approaches, the in- 
habitants escape the winter night by 
travel to their city’s twin at the an- 
tipodes, somewhat as the Martian 
colonists migrated yearly in RED 
PLANET. 

Much of this scjieme was de- 
scribed by Carl Sagan in a 1961 ar- 
ticle in SCIENCE. Poul Anderson 
amplified it in “To Build A 
World’’, GALAXY, 1964 (June). 
In Poul’s story there was fierce 
competition for the better parts of 
Venus, resulting in a social system 
composed of clans engaged in in- 
numerable limited wars. It’s a 



ft**************

reasonable projection; the first set- 
tlements will be small, probably 
dominated by one man, and inter- 
marriage may well result in a clan- 
structured social system. 

We haven’t yet mapped the face 
of Venus, so we don’t know where 
or how large the seas will be. We 
don’t know a lot (heck, we know 
almost nothing) about the sub- 
structure of Venerian soil. How 
much water will be absorbed? At 
what level will a water table form? 

For that matter, will it be enough 
to introduce our algae to get every- 
thing started, or will we also have 
to provide fertilizers: phosphorus, 
trace elements, that sort of thing? 

Our massive tampering with at- 
mospheric energies and surface 
temperatures may trigger techtonic 
activities. Venus may erupt in a 
number of places, and spew out 

71 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



even more CO2, water vapor, 
methane, and such like. 

Project Morning Star won’t be all 
smooth sailing. There will undoubt- 
edly be unforseen problems. For all 
that, the terraforming of Venus is 
no pipe dream. We could do it. We 
can do it right now, if we want to 
pay for it. We can create a new 
frontier, larger than the New World 
ever was. 

In other words, there’s room here 
for more stories than we had about 
the “old” Venus with her swamps 
and dinosaurs. True, we won’t have 
any intelligent Venerians to contend 
with. It’s unlikely that there’s any 
life on Venus at all. 

Unlikely but not impossible. 
There are, after all, Earth-like con- 
ditions of temperature and pressure 
in the Venerian atmosphere, and 
this is about the only planet — other 
than Earth — in the Solar System 
that can make that statement. 
Moreover, it may be that there have 
always been spots with Terrestrial 
conditions on Venus. 

True, life isn’t likely to have 
evolved under present Venerian 
conditions, but some planetary sci- 
entists now believe that Venus was 
once much more like Earth. Then, 
for reasons not completely under- 
stood, the planet began to heat up 
and dry out. 

If by that time life had evolved, 
it may have taken to the air, and be 
hanging around there yet. 

It isn’t likely, of course. If Venus 
had really active bugs they should 



be busily tearing off the CO2 cover 
that keeps Venus hot, and we 
wouldn’t need to infect the Queen 
of Heaven with blue-green algae. 

If there are any native Venerian 
bugs, Project Morning Star will no 
doubt doom them to extinction. 

We have the technology to make 
Venus a place where we can live. 
Have we the right to do it? Should 
we, granted that we can? 

After all, this is “pollution” on a 
grand scale. True it’s not pollution 
to our way of thinking; but what’s 
good clean air to us is certainly 
unnatural to Venus. 

I suppose that we can and proba- 
bly will debate this question for a 
long time to come, and when the 
debate is finished I suspect that no 
one will have changed opinion by 
one jot. Those who feel it mon- 
strous to go about interfering with 
nature, and see the terraforming of 
Venus as blasphemy (they will 
probably use the term ‘obscene’) are 
not likely to change their minds. 

Those who see Project Morning 
Star as the most glorious opportu- 
nity that has yet faced man are un- 
likely to be concerned about mind- 
less Venerian gas-bags or other 
hypothetical Venerian critters 
(beyond building them a pre- 
Moming Star zoo). 

Meanwhile, one thing is certain: 
it is possible that within my lifetime 
I could dateline this column “Ven- 
usberg”. We can do it, and some of 
you could live there. 

Just after that Big Rain. ★

OUR 

MANY ROADS 

TO THE STARS 

POUL ANDERSON 

There are countless varieties of 
science fiction these days, and I 
would be the last to want any of 
them restricted in any way. 
Nevertheless, what first drew me to 
this literature and, after more years 
than I like to add up, still holds me, 
is its dealing with the marvels of 
the universe. To look aloft at the 
stars on a clear night and think that 
someday, somehow we might actu- 
ally get out among them, rouses the 
thrill anew, and I become young 
again. After all, we made it to the 
Moon, didn’t we? Meanwhile, only 
science fiction of the old and truly 
kind takes the imagination forth on 
that journey. Therefore I put up 
with its frequent flaws; and so does 
many another dreamer. 

But are we mere dreamers, telling 
ourselves stories of voyages yonder 
as our ancestors told of voyages to 
Avalon and Cibola? Those never 
existed, and the stars do; but, realis- 
tically, does any possibility of 
reaching them? 

The case against interstellar travel 
traditionally begins with the sheer 
distances. While Pioneer 10 and 11, 
the Jupiter flybys, will leave the 
Solar System, they won’t get as far 

74 



as Alpha Centauri, the nearest 
neighbor sun, for more than 40,000 
years. (They aren’t actually bound 
in that direction.) At five times their 
speed, or 100 miles per second, 
which we are nowhere close to 
reaching today, the trip would take 
longer than recorded history goes 
back. And the average separation of 
stars in this galactic vicinity is twice 
as great. 

If we could go very much 
faster — 

At almost the speed of light, 
we’d reach Alpha Centauri in about 
four and a third years. But as most 
of you know, we who were faring 
would experience a shorter journey. 
Both the theory of relativity and ex- 
perimental physics show that time 
passes “faster” for a fast-moving 
object. The closer to the speed of 
light, the greater the difference, un- 
til at that velocity itself, a spaceman 
would make the trip in no time at 
all. However, the girl he left behind 
him would measure his transit as 
taking the same number of years as 
a light ray does; and he’d take 
equally long in coming back to her. 

In reality, the velocity of light in 
vacuo, usually symbolized by c, 
cannot be attained by any material 
body. From a physical viewpoint, 
the reason lies in Einstein’s famous 
equation E = me 2 . Mass and 
energy are equivalent. The faster a 
body moves, the more energy it 
has, and hence the more mass. This 
rises steeply as velocity gets close 
to c, and at that speed would be- 

GALAXY 




come infinite, an obvious impossi- 
bility. 

Mass increases by the same factor 
as time (and length) shrink. An ap- 
pendix to this essay defines the 
terms more precisely than here. A 
table there gives some representa- 
tive values of the factor for different 
values of velocity, v, compared to 
c. At v = 0.7 c, that is, at a speed 
of 70% light’s, time aboard ship 
equals distance covered in light- 
years. Thus, a journey of 10 light- 
years at 0.7 c would occupy 10 
years of the crew’s lives, although 
to people on Earth or on the target 
planet, it would take about 14. 

There’s a catch here. We have 
quietly been supposing that the 
whole voyage is made at exactly 
this rate. In practice, the ship would 
have to get up to speed first, and 
brake as it neared the goal. Both 
these maneuvers take time; and most 
of this time is spent at low ve- 
locities where the relativistic effects 
aren’t noticeable. 

Let’s imagine that we accelerate 
at one gravity, increasing our speed 
by 32 feet per second each second 
and thus providing ourselves with a 
comfortable Earth-normal weight 
inboard. It will take us approxi- 
mately a year (a shade less) to come 
near c, during which period we will 
have covered almost half a light- 
year, and during most of which 
period our time rate won’t be sig- 
nificantly different from that of the 
outside cosmos. In fact, not until 
the eleventh month would the factor 



get as low as 0.5, though from then 
on it would start a really steepening 
nosedive. Similar considerations ap- 
ply at journey’s end, while we slow 
down. Therefore a trip under these 
conditions would never take less 
than two years as far as we are con- 
cerned; if the distance covered is 10 
light-years, the time required is 11 
years as far as the girl (or boy) 
friend left behind is concerned. 

At the “equalizing” v of 0.7 c, 
these figures become 10.7 years for 
the crew and 14.4 years for the 
stay-at-homes. This illustrates the 
dramatic gains that the former, if 
not the latter, can make by pushing 
c quite closely. But let’s stay with 
that value of 0.7 c for the time be- 
ing, since it happens to be the one 
chosen by Bernard Oliver for his 
argument against the feasibility of 
star travel. 

Now Dr. Oliver, vice president 
for research and development at 
Hewlett-Packard, is definitely not 
unimaginative, nor hostile to the 
idea as such. Rather, he is intensely 
interested in contacting extraterres- 
trial intelligence, and was the guid- 
ing genius of Project Cyclops, 
which explored the means of doing 
so by radio. The design which his 
group came up with could, if built, 
detect anybody who’s using radio 
energy like us today within 100 
light-years. Or it could receive 
beacon signals of reasonable 
strength within 1000 light-years: a 
sphere which encloses a million 
suns akin to Sol and half a billion

which are different. 

Still, he does not fudge the facts. 
Making the most favorable assump- 
tion, a matter-antimatter annihilation 
system which expels radiation itself, 
he has calculated the minimum re- 
quirement for a round trip with a 
stopover at the destination star, at a 
peak speed of 0.7c. Assuming 1000 
tons of ship plus payload, which is 
certainly modest, he found that it 
must convert some 33,000 tons of 
fuel into energy — sufficient to sup- 
ply the United States, at present 
levels of use, for half a million 
years. On first starting off from or- 
bit, the ship would spend 10 times 
the power that the Sun gives to our 
entire Earth. Shielding requirements 
alone, against stray gamma rays, 
make this an absurdity, not to speak 
of a thousand square miles of radiat- 
ing surface to cool the vessel if as 
little as one one-millionth of the 
energy reaches it in the form of 
waste heat. 

Though we can reduce these fig- 
ures a good deal if we assume it 
can refuel at the other end for its re- 
turn home, the scheme looks im- 
practical regardless. Moreover, Dr. 
Oliver, no doubt deliberately, has 
not mentioned that space is not 
empty. Between local stars, it con- 
tains about one hydrogen atom per 
cubic centimeter, plus smaller 
amounts of other materials. This is 
a harder vacuum than any we can 
achieve artificially. But a vessel 
ramming through it at 0.7 c would 
release X-radiation at the rate of 



some 30 million roentgen units per 
hour. It takes less than 1000 to kill 
a human being. No material shield- 
ing could protect the crew for long, 
if at all. 

Not every scientist is this pes- 
simistic about the rocket to the 
stars, that is, a craft which carries 
its own energy source and reaction 
mass. Some hope for smaller, un- 
manned probes, perhaps moving at 
considerably lower speeds. But giv- 
en the mass required for their life 
support and equipment, men who 
went by such a vehicle would have 
to reckon on voyages lasting genera- 
tions or centuries. 

This is not impossible, of course. 
Maybe they could pass the time in 
suspended animation. Naturally 
radioactive atoms in the body set an 
upper limit to that, since they de- 
stroy tissue which would then not 
be replaced. But Carl Sagan, as- 
tronomer and exobiologist at Cor- 
nell University, estimates that a 
spore can survive up to a million 
years. This suggests to me that hu- 
mans should be good for anyway 
several thousand. 

Or maybe, in a huge ship with a 
complete ecology, an expedition 
could beget and raise children to 
carry their mission on. Calculations 
by Gerald K. O’Neill, professor of 
physics at Harvard, strongly indi- 
cate that this is quite feasible. His 
work has actually dealt with the 
possibility of establishing perma- 
nent, self-sustaining colonies in or- 
bit, pleasanter to live in than most

of Earth and capable of producing 
more worldlets like themselves from 
extraterrestrial resources. He con- 
cludes that we can start on it now, 
with existing technology and at 
startlingly low cost, and have the 
first operational by the late 1980’s. 
Not long afterward, somebody 
could put a motor on one of these. 

The hardened science fiction 
reader may think such ideas are old 
hat. And so they are, in fiction. But 
to me the fact is infinitely more ex- 
citing than any story — that the ac- 
complishment can actually be made, 
that sober studies by reputable pro- 
fessionals are confirming the dream. 

True, I’d prefer to believe that 
men and women can get out there 
faster, more easily, so that the 
people who sent them off will still 
be alive when word arrives of what 
they have discovered. Is this wish- 
ful thinking? We’ve written off the 
rocket as a means of ultra-fast 
travel, but may there be other 
ways? 

Yes, probably there are. Even 
within the framework of conven- 
tional physics, where you can never 
surpass c, we already have more 
than one well-reasoned proposal. If 
not yet as detailed and mathematical 
as Oberth’s keystone work on in- 
terplanetary travel of 1929, the best 
of them seem equivalent to Tsiol- 
kovsky’s cornerstone work of 1911. 
If the time scale is the same for fu- 
ture as for past developments, then 
the first manned Alpha Centauri ex- 
pedition should leave about the year 



2010 . 

That’s counting from R. W. Bus- 
sard’s original paper on the in- 
terstellar ramjet, which appeared in 
1960. Chances are that a flat histor- 
ical parallel is silly. But the en- 
gineering ideas positively are not. 
They make a great deal of sense. 

Since the ramjet has been in a 
fair number of stories already. I’ll" 
describe the principle rather briefly. 
We’ve seen that at high speeds, a 
vessel must somehow protect its 
crew from the atoms and ions in 
space. Lead or other material shield- 
ing is out of the question. 
Hopelessly too much would be re- 
quired, it would give off secondary 
radiation of its own, and ablation 
would wear it down, incidentally 
producing a lot of heat, less readily 
dissipated in space than in an at- 
mosphere. Since the gas must be 
controlled anyway, why not put it 
to work? 

Once the ship has reached a 
speed which turns out to be reason- 
able for a thermonuclear rocket — 
and we’re on the verge of that 
technology today — a scoop can col- 
lect the interstellar gas and funnel it 
into a reaction chamber. There, 
chosen parts can be fusion-burned 
for energy to throw the rest out 
backward, thus propelling the vessel 
forward. Ramjet aircraft use the 
same principle, except that they 
must supply fuel to combine with 
the oxygen they collect. The ramjet 
starcraft takes everything it needs 
from its surroundings. Living off

the country, it faces none of the 
mass-ratio problems of a rocket, 
and might be able to crowd c very 
closely. 

Needless to say, even at the pre- 
sent stage of pure theory, things 
aren’t that simple. For openers, how 
large an apparatus do we need? For 
a ship-plus-payload mass of 1000 
tons, accelerating at one gravity and 
using proton-proton fusion for pow- 
er, Bussard and Sagan have both 
calculated a scoop radius of 2000 
kilometers. Now we have no idea as 
yet how to make that particular 
reaction go. We are near the point 
of fusing deuterons, or deuterons 
and tritons (hydrogen nuclei with 
one and two neutrons respectively), 
to get a net energy release. But 
these isotopes are far less common 
than ordinary hydrogen, and thus 
would require correspondingly 
larger intakes. Obviously, we can’t 
use collectors made of metal. 

But then, we need nonmaterial 
shielding anyway. Electromagnetic 
fields exert force on charged parti- 
cles. A steady laser barrage emitted 
by the ship can ionize all neutral 
atoms within a safety zone, and so 
make them controllable, as well as 
vaporizing rare bits of dust and 
gravel which would otherwise be a 
hazard. (I suspect, myself, that this 
won’t be necessary. Neutral atoms 
have electrical asymmetries which 
offer a possible grip to the force- 
fields of a more advanced technol- 
ogy than ours. I also feel sure we 
will master the proton-proton reac- 



tion, and eventually matter- 
antimatter annihilation. But for 
now, let’s play close to our vests.) 
A force-field scoop, which being 
massless can be of enormous size, 
will catch these ions, funnel them 
down paths which are well clear of 
the crew section and into a fusion 
chamber, cause the chosen nuclei to 
burn, and expel everything aft to 
drive the vessel forward, faster and 
faster. 

To generate such fields, A. J. 
Fennelly of Yeshiva University and 
G. L. Matloff of the Polytechnic In- 
stitute of New York propose a cop- 
per cylinder coated with a super- 
conducting layer of niobium-tin al- 
loy. The size is not excessive, 400 
meters in length and 200 in diame- 
ter. As for braking, they suggest a 
drogue made of boron, for its high 
melting point, ten kilometers across. 
This would necessarily work rather 
slowly. But then, these authors are 
cautious in their assumptions; for 
instance, they derive a peak velocity 
of just 0.12 c. The system could 
reach Alpha Centauri in about 53 
years, Tau Ceti in 115. 

By adding wings, however, they 
approximately halve these travel 
times. The wings are two great 
superconducting batteries, each a 
kilometer square. Cutting the lines 
of the galactic magnetic field, they 
generate voltages which can jje 
tapped for exhaust acceleration, 
for magnetic bottle containers for 
the power reaction, and for inboard 
electricity. With thrust shut off, 



78

they act as auxiliary brakes, much 
shortening the deceleration period. 
When power is drawn at different 
rates on either side, they provide 
maneuverability — majestically slow , 
but sufficient — almost as if they 
were huge oars. 

All in all, it appears that a vessel 
of this general type can bring 
explorers to the nearest stars while 
they are still young enough to carry 
out the exploration — and the pre- 
liminary colonization? — themselves. 
Civilization at home will start re- 
ceiving a flood of beamed informa- 
tion, fascinating, no doubt often rev- 
olutionary in unforeseeable ways, 
within a few years of their arrival. 
Given only a slight lengthening of 
human life expectancy, they might 
well spend a generation out yonder 
and get home alive, still hale. Cer- 
tainly their children can. 

Robert L. Forward, a leading 
physicist at Hughes Research 
Laboratories, has also interested 
himself in the use of the galactic 
magnetic field. As he points out, 
the ion density in interstellar space 
is so low that a probe could easily 
maintain a substantial voltage across 
itself. Properly adjusted, the interac- 
tion forces produced by this wiH al- 
low mid-course corrections and ter- 
minal maneuvers at small extra 
energy cost. Thus we could investi- 
gate more than one star with a 
single probe, and eventually bring it 
home again. 

Indeed, the price of research in 
deep space is rather small. Even the 



cost of manned vessels is estimated 
by several careful thinkers as no 
more than ten billion dollars 
each — starting with today’s technol- 
ogy. That’s about 50 dollars per 
American, much less than we spend 
every year on cigarettes and booze, 
enormously less than goes for wars, 
bureaucrats, subsidies to inefficient 
businesses, or the servicing of the 
national debt. For mankind as a 
whole, a starship would run about 
$2.50 per head. The benefits it 
would return in the way of knowl- 
edge, and thus of improved capa- 
bility, are immeasurably great. 

But to continue with those man- 
ned craft. Mention of using in- 
terstellar magnetism for maneuver- 
ing raises the thought of using it for 
propulsion. That is, by employing 
electromagnetic forces which in- 
teract with that field, a ship could 
ideally accelerate itself without hav- 
ing to expel any mass backward. 
This would represent a huge saving 
over what the rocket demands. 

The trouble is, the galactic field 
is very weak, and no doubt very 
variable from region to region. 
Though it can be valuable in ways 
that we have seen, there appears to 
be no hope of using it for a power- 
ful drive. 

Might we invent other devices? 
For instance, if we could somehow 
establish a negative gravity force, 
this might let our ship react against 
the mass of the universe as a whole, 
and thus need no jets. Unfortunate- 
ly, nobody today knows how to do

any such thing, and most physicists 
take for granted it’s impossible. Not 
all agree: because antigravity-type 
forces do occur in relativity theory, 
under special conditions. 

Physics does offer one way of 
reaching extremely high speeds 
free, the Einsteinian catapult. Later 
I shall have more to say about the 
weird things that happen when 
large, ultra-dense masses spin very 
fast. But among these is their gen- 
eration of a force different from 
Newtonian gravity, which has a 
mighty accelerating effect of its 
own. Two neutron stars, orbiting 
nearly in contact, could kick almost 
to light velocity a ship which ap- 
proached them on the right orbit. 

Alas, no such pair seems to exist 
anywhere near the Solar System. 
Besides, we’d presumably want 
something similar in the neighbor- 
hood of our destination, with 
exactly the characteristics necessary 
to slow us down. The technique 
looks rather implausible. What is 
likely, though, is that closer study 
of phenomena like these may give 
us clues to the method of construct- 
ing a field drive. 

Yet do we really need it? Won’t 
the Bussard ramjet serve? Since it 
picks up everything it requires as it 
goes, why can’t it keep on ac- 
celerating indefinitely, until it 
comes as close to c as the captain 
desires? The Fennelly-Matloff vehi- 
cle is not intended to do this. But 
why can’t a more advanced model? 

Quite possibly it can! 

80 



Before taking us off on such a 
voyage, maybe I’d better answer a 
question or two. If the ship, ac- 
celerating at one gravity, is near c 
in a year, and if c is the ultimate 
speed which nature allows, how can 
the ship keep on accelerating just as 
hard, for just as long as the flight 
plan says? 

The reason lies in the relativistic 
contraction of space and time, when 
these are measured by a fast-moving 
observer. Suppose we, at rest with 
respect to the stars, track a vessel 
for 10 light-years at its steady speed 
of 0.9 c. To us, the passage takes 
11 years. To the crew, it takes 4.4 
years: because the distance crossed 
is proportionately less. They never 
experience faster-than-light travel 
either. What they do experience, 
when they tum their instruments 
outward, is a cosmos strangely flat- 
tened in the direction of their mo- 
tion, where the stars (and their un- 
seen friends at home) age strangely 
fast. 

The nearer they come to c, the 
more rapidly these effects increase. 
Thus as they speed up, they per- 
ceive themselves as accelerating at a 
steady rate through a constantly 
shrinking universe. Observers oh a 
planet would perceive them as ac- 
celerating at an ever lower rate 
through an unchanged universe. At 
last, perhaps, millions of light-years 
might be traversed and millions of 
years pass by outside while a man 
inboard draws a breath. 

By the way, those authors are 

GALAXY 




wrong who have described the 
phenomenon in terms of “subjec- 
tive” versus “objective” time. One 
set of measurements is as valid as 
another. 

The “twin paradox” does not 
arise. This old chestnut says, 
“Look, suppose we’re twins, and 
you stay home while I go traveling 
at high speed. Now I could equally 
well claim I’m stationary and you’re 
in motion — therefore that you’re the 
one flattened out and living at a 
slower rate, not me. So what hap- 
pens when we get back together 
again? How can each of us be 
younger than his twin?” 

It overlooks the fact that the 
traveler does come home. The situa- 
tion would indeed be symmetrical if 
the spaceman moved forever at a 
fixed velocity. But then he and his 
brother, by definition, never would 
meet to compare notes. His acceler- 
ations (which include slowdowns 
and changes of course) take the 
whole problem out of special and 
into general relativity. Against the 
background of the stars, the traveler 
has moved in a variable fashion; 
forces have acted on him. 

Long before time and space mea- 
surements aboard ship differ bi- 
zarrely much from those on Earth, 
navigational problems will arise. 
They are the result of two factors, 
aberration and Doppler effect. 

Aberration is the apparent dis- 
placement of an object in the visual 
field of a moving observer. It re- 
sults from combining his velocity 



with the velocity of light. (Analo- 
gously, if we are out in the rain and, 
standing still, feel it falling straight 
down, we will feel it hitting us at a 
slant when we start walking. The 
change in angle will be larger if we 
run.) At the comparatively small 
orbital speed of Earth, sensitive in- 
struments can detect the aberration 
of the stars. At speeds close to c, it 
will be huge. Stars will seem to 
crawl across the sky as we acceler- 
ate, bunching in its forward half 
and thinning out aft. 

Doppler effect, perhaps more 
widely familiar, is the shift in ob- 
served wavelength from an emitting 
object, when the observer’s velocity 
changes. If we move away from a 
star, we see its light reddened; if we 
move toward a star, we see its light 
turned more blue. Again, these 
changes become extremely marked 
as we approach c. 

Eventually our relativistic as- 
tronaut sees most of the stars 
gathered in a ring ahead of him, 
though a few sparsely strewn indi- 
viduals remain visible elsewhere. 
The ring itself, which Frederik Pohl 
has dubbed the “starbow,” centers 
on a circle which is mainly dark, 
because nearly all light from there 
has been blue-shifted out of the fre- 
quencies we can see. The leading or 
inner edge of the ring is bluish 
white, its trailing or outer edge red- 
dish; in between is a gradation of 
colors, akin to what we normally 
observe. Fred Hollander, a chem- 
ist at Brookhaven National Lab- 



FORUM 



81 




oratories, has calculated the 
starbow’s exact appearance for dif- 
ferent v. It gets narrower and moves 
farther forward, the bull’s eye dead 
ahead gets smaller and blacker, the 
faster we go — until, for instance, at 
0.9999 c we perceive a starbow 
about ten degrees of arc in width i cen- 
tered on a totally black circle of 
about the same diameter, and little or 
nothing shows anywhere else in the 
sky. 

At that speed, 0.9999 c, we’d 
cross 100 light-years in 20 months 
of our personal lifetimes. So it’s 
worth trying for; but we’ll have to 
figure out some means of knowing 
where we are! Though difficult, the 
problem does not look unsolvable in 
principle. 

It may become so beyond a cer- 
tain velocity. If we travel under ac- 
celeration the whole way, speeding 
up continuously to the half-way 
point, thereafter braking at the same 
rate until we reach our goal: then 
over considerable distances we get 
truly staggering relativity factors. 
The longer a voyage, the less difi 
ference it makes to us precisely how 
long it is. 

Thus, Dr. Sagan points out that 
explorers faring in this wise at one 
gravity will reach the nearer stars 
within a few years, Earth time, and 
slightly less, crew time. But they 
will cross the approximately 650 
light-years to Deneb in 12 or 13 
years of their own lifespans; the 
30,000 light-years to the center of 
our galaxy in 21 ship years; the two 



million light-years to the An- 
dromeda galaxy in 29 ship years; or 
the 10 million light-years to the 
Virgo cluster of galaxies in 31 ship 
years. If they can stand higher ac- 
celerations, or have some way to 
counteract the drag on their bodies, 
they can cross these gulfs in less of 
their own time; the mathematical 
formula governing this is in the ap- 
pendix. 

But will the starbow become too 
thin and dim for navigation? Or will 
they encounter some other practical 
limit? For instance, when matter is 
accelerated, it radiates energy in the 
form of gravity waves. The larger 
the mass, the stronger this radiation; 
and of course the mass of our 
spaceship will be increasing by 
leaps and bounds and pole-vaults. 
Eventually it may reach a condition 
where it is radiating away as much 
energy as it can take in, and thus be 
unable to go any faster. 

However, the- real practical limit 
is likelier to arise from the fact that 
we have enough stars near home to 
keep us interested for millennia to 
come. Colonies planted on worlds 
around some of these can, in due 
course, serve as nuclei for human 
expansion ever further into the uni- 
verse. 

Because many atoms swept 
through its force-fields are bound to 
give off light, a ramjet under weigh 
must be an awesome spectacle. At a 
safe distance, probably the hull 
where the crew lives is too small 
for the naked eye. Instead, against

GALAXY 




the constellations one sees a trans- 
lucent shell of multi-colored glow, 
broad in front, tapering aft to a 
fiery point where the nuclear reac- 
tion is going on. (Since this must be 
contained by force-fields anyway, 
there is no obvious reason for the 
fusion chamber to be a metal 
room.) Thence the exhaust streams 
backward, at first invisible or nearly 
so, where its particles are closely 
controlled, but becoming brilliant 
further off as they begin to collide, 
until finally a nebula-like chaos 
fades away into the spatial night. 

It’s not only premature, it’s point- 
less to worry about limitations. 
Conventional physics appears to tell 
us that, although nature has placed 
an eternal bound on the speed of 
our traveling, the stars can still be 
ours. .if we really want them. 

Yet we would like to reach them 
more swiftly, with less effort. Have 
we any realistic chance whatsoever 
of finding a way around the light- 
velocity barrier? 

Until quite recently, every sensi- 
ble physicist would have replied 
with a resounding “No.” Most con- 
tinue to do so. They point to a vast 
mass of experimental data; for in- 
stance, if subatomic particles did 
not precisely obey Einsteinian laws, 
our big accelerators wouldn’t work. 
The conservatives ask where there 
is the slightest empirical evidence 
for phenomena which don’t fit into 
the basic scheme of relativity. And 
they maintain that, if ever we did 
send anything faster than light, it

would violate causality. 

1 don’t buy that last argument, 
myself. It seems to me that, 
mathematically and logically, it pre- 
supposes part of what it sets out to 
prove. But this gets a bit too tech- 
nical for the present essay, espe- 
cially since many highly intelligent 
persons disagree with me. Th'ose 
whom I mentioned are not conserva- 
tives in the sense of having stick- 
in-the-mud minds. They are among 
the very people whose genius and 
imagination make science the su- 
premely exciting, creative endeavor 
which it is these days. 

Nevertheless we do have a minor- 
ity of equally qualified pioneers 
who have lately been advancing 
new suggestions. 

I suppose the best known idea 
comes from Gerald Feinberg, pro- 
fessor of physics at Columbia Uni- 
versity. He has noted that the 
Einsteinian equations do not actu- 
ally forbid material particles which 
move faster than light — if these 
have a mass that can be described 
by an imaginary number (that is, an 
ordinary number multiplied by the 
square root of minus one. Imaginary 
quantities are common, e.g., in the 
theory of electromagnetism). Such 
“tachyons,” as he calls them, 
would travel faster and faster the 
less energy they have; it would take 
infinite energy to slow them down 
to c, which is thus a barrier for 
them too. 

Will it forever separate us, who 
are composed of “tardyons,” from 



the tachyon part of the cosmos? 
Perhaps — but not totally. It is mean- 
ingless to speak of anything which 
we cannot, in principle, detect if it 
exists. If tachyons do, there must be 
some way by which we can find 
experimental evidence for them, no 
matter how indirect. This implies 
some kind of interaction (via pho- 
tons?) with tardyons. But interaction, 
in turn, implies a possibility of 
modulation. That is, if they can af- 
fect us, we can affect them. 

And. .in principle, if you can 
modulate, you can do anything. 
Maybe it won’t ever be feasible to 
use tachyons to beam a man across 
space; but might we, for instance, 
use them to communicate faster 
than light? 

Needless to say, first we have to 
catch them, i.e. show that they 
exist. This has not yet been done, 
and maybe it never can be done be- 
cause in fact there aren’t any. Still, 
one dares hope. A -very few sugges- 
tive data are beginning to come out 
of certain laboratories — 

Besides, we have other places to 
look. Hyperspace turns out to be 
more than a hoary science fiction 
catchphrase. Geometrodynamics 
now allows a transit from point to 
point, without crossing the space 
between, via a warp going “out- 
side” that space — often called a 
wormhole. Most wormholes are ex- 
ceedingly small, of subatomic di- 
mensions; and a trip through one is 
no faster than a trip through normal 
space. Nevertheless, the idea opens

up a whole new field of research, 
which may yield startling dis- 
coveries. 

Black holes have been much in 
the news, and in science fiction, 
these past several years. They are 
masses so dense, with gravity fields 
so strong, that light itself cannot es- 
cape. Theory has predicted for more 
than 40 years that all stars above a 
particular size must eventually col- 
lapse into the black hole state. To- 
day astronomers think they have lo- 
cated some, as in Cygnus X-l. And 
we see hypotheses about black holes 
of less than stellar mass, which we 
might be able to find floating in 
space and utilize. 

For our purposes here, the most 
interesting trait of a black hole is its 
apparent violation of a whole series 
of conservation laws so fundamental 
to physics that they are well-nigh 
Holy Writ. Thus many an issue, not 
long ago considered thoroughly set- 
tled, is again up for grabs. The pos- 
sibility of entering a black hole and 
coming out “instantly” at the far 
end of a space warp is being seri- 
ously discussed. Granted, astronauts 
probably couldn’t survive a close 
approach to such an object. But 
knowledge of these space warp 
phenomena and their laws, if they 
do occur in reality, might well en- 
able us to build machines which — 
because they don’t employ ve- 
locity — can circumvent the c bar- 
rier. 

Black holes aren’t the sole things 
which play curious tricks on space

and time. An ultra-dense toroid, 
spinning very rapidly in smoke ring 
fashion, should theoretically create 
what is called a Kerr metric space 
warp, opening a way to hyperspace. 

The most breathtaking recent de- 
velopment of relativity that I know 
of is by F. J. Tipler, a physicist at 
the University of Maryland. Accord- 
ing to his calculations, not just 
near-instantaneous crossings of 
space should be possible, but time 
travel should be! A cylinder of 
ultra-dense matter, rotating ex- 
tremely fast (velocity at the circum- 
ference greater than 0.5 c) produces 
a region of multiply periodic space- 
time. A particle entering this can, 
depending on its exact track, reach 
any event in the universe, past or 
future. 

The work was accepted for publi- 
cation in Physical Review, which is 
about as respectable as science can 
get. Whether it will survive criti- 
cism remains to be seen. But if noth- 
ing else, it has probably knocked 
the foundation out from under the 
causality argument against faster- 
than-light travel: by forcing us to re- 
think our whole concept of causali- 
ty- 

The foregoing ideas lie within the 
realm of accepted physics, or at 
least on its debatable borders. Dr. 
Forward has listed several others 
which are beyond the frontier 
. .but only barely, and only to 
date. Closer study could show, in 
our near future, that one or more of 
them refer to something real. 



For instance, we don’t know 
what inertia “is.” It seems to be a 
basic property of matter; but why? 
Could it be an inductive effect of 
gravitation, as Mach’s Principle 
suggests? If so, could we find ways 
to modify .it, and would we then be 
held back by the increase of mass 
with velocity? 

Could we discover, or produce, 
negative mass? This would gravita- 
tionally repel the usual positive 
kind. Two equal masses, positive 
and negative, linked together, 
would make each other accelerate in 
a particular direction without any 
change in momentum or energy. 
Could they therefore transcend c? 

A solution of Einstein’s field 
equations in five dimensions for 
charged particles gives an electron 
velocity of a billion trillion c. What 
then of a spaceship, if the con- 
tinuum should turn out to have five 
rather than four dimensions? 

Conventional physics limits the 
speed of mass-energy. But informa- 
tion is neither; from a physical 
standpoint, it represents negative en- 
tropy. So can information outrun 
light, perhaps without requiring any 
medium for its transmission? If you 
can send information, in principle 
you can send anything. 

Magnificent and invaluable 
though the structure of relativity is, 
does it hold the entire truth? There 
are certain contradictions in its basic 
assumptions which have never been 
resolved and perhaps never can be. 
Or relativity could be just a special 



86 



GALAXY 




case, applying only to local condi- 
tions. 

Once we are well and truly 
out into space, we may find the 
signs of a structure immensely more 
ample. 

These speculations have taken us 
quite far beyond known science. 



But they help to show us how little 
known that science really is, even 
the parts which have long felt com- 
fortingly, or confiningly, familiar. 
We can almost certainly reach the 
stars. Very possibly, we can reach 
them easily. 

If we have the will. ★ 



Appendix 



Readers who shudder at sight of 
an equation can skip this part, 
though they may like to see the 
promised table. For different ve- 
locities, it gives the values of the 
factors “tau” and “gamma.” These 
are simply the inverses of each 
other. A little explanation of them 
may be in order. 

Suppose we have two observers, 
A and B, who have constant ve- 
locities. We can consider either one 
as being stationary, the other as 
moving at velocity v. A will mea- 
sure the length of a yardstick B car- 
ries, in the direction of motion, and 
the interval between two readings of 
a clock B carries, as if these quan- 
tities were multiplied by tau. For 
example, if v is 0.9 c, then B’s 
yardstick is merely 0.44 times as 
long in A’s eyes as if B were mo- 
tionless; and an hour, registered on 
B’s clock, corresponds to merely 
0.44 hour on A’s. On the other 
hand, mass is multiplied by gamma. 
That is, when B moves at 0.9 c, his 
mass according to A is 2.26 times 
what it was when B was motion- 
less. 

B, in turn, observes himself as 



normal, but A and A’s environs as 
having suffered exactly the same 
changes. Both observers are right.

As for relativistic acceleration, if 
this has a constant value a up to 
midpoint, then a negative (braking)

Part II of III 




WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

The place seems to be a mockup of 
Dante’s Inferno: a great funnel lined 
with circular ledges. I was on the top 
and outer level, the Vestibule, when 
Benito got me out of some kind of sen- 
sory deprivation environment. Since 
then we’ve crossed several of the 
ledges, and they do match my some- 
what fuzzy memory of Dante’s book. I 
wish I could remember more. I know it 
got progressively worse going 
down. .fire, demons, boiling 
blood. down there where Benito is 
trying to lead me. 

Benito says we’ve died and gone to 
Hell. He’s convinced that Dante 
Alighieri saw the real Hell, and map- 
ped it. He’s following the map, down 
to the bottom of the funnel and out. 

The fat man has some valuable tal- 
ents, but he’s nuts. Even if this was 
Dante’s copyrighted Hell, they 
wouldn’t let us out at the bottom. 
Dante was on a divinely ordained mis- 
sion, and his guide could call oil 
angels! I can’t believe in Dante’s 
ridiculous hole-through-the-Earth Hell. 
So where am I? 

Item : I remember dying. The fans 
got me drunk at a World Science Fic- 
tion Convention. I made a silly bet: 
that I could sit on a window sill eight 
floors up and drain a fifth of rum 
without falling out. I lost. 

Item: I’ve seen people who are un- 
deniably dead. The Greeks wearing to- 
gas and famous names, or armor and 
famous names, could be robots. But I 
knew Jan Petri, and I attended his 
funeral. He’s here in the Circle of 
Gluttons! 



INFERNO 



89 




So try this. After I hit the concrete 
the fans got up a fund to freeze me. I 
waited it out as a cryogenic corpse. A 
lot of time must have passed before the 
medics learned enough to repair the 
damage and thaw me. 

By then someone had built this tre- 
mendous funnel. Most of the people 
I’ve seen could be corpsicles revived 
for profit by the Builders. It’s a Dis- 
neyland for masochists and sadists, 
with the sadists as devils and the 
masochists scattered among the revived 
dead, and evil miracles to entertain 
them. 

Benito could be one of the paying 
customers. He won’t say what level he 
comes from. He seems to accept every- 
thing: the massless windtossed victims 
on the second level, the strange wars 
on the fourth, the dirty frozen slush 
that holds Jan Petri, the filthy swamp 
and the homicidal maniacs in it and 
the quiet people moored under the wa- 
ters. 

Could the place be an insane asylum 
where futuristic mental patients act out 
their delusions? I’ve seen enough 
crazies. But the sadomasochistic Infer- 
noland looks more likely. 

I tried to get out over the rim wall. 
It receded like a demonstration of 
Xeno’s paradox: some kind of space 
warp. The Builders are hideously pow- 
erful. I don’t want to fight them. 

I only want out. 

And I’ve found a way. 

Benito managed to con the bureau- 
crats out of a couple of stacks of togas, 
for fabric. There’s wood in the swamp, 
and thermals above the red hot wall 
below. We’re going to fly out, over the 
rim wall. 

They can’t keep a hard science fic- 
tion writer in hell!

1 HINGS ARE DEFINITELY looking 
up for Allen Caipentier.” 

“I beg your pardon?” Benito was 
looking out at the marsh, at decay- 
ing trees embedded in fog. 

‘‘We’ve got a quiet place to 
work, I’ve made some flint tools, 
and there’s everything we need for 
the glider. What more could we 
want?” 

Benito sighed, and I got back to 
work. The first job was to find a 
place to loft the glider. We were on 
a little area of high ground, no 
more than thirty yards square and 
nestled up against the base of the 
cliff. The bad-tempered character 
was between us and everyone else. 
He wouldn’t let anyone else past, 
and he wasn’t about to bother us. I 
could just see him through the mist. 

First things first. I used a log to 
flatten out an area larger than the 
glider would be, then cut a long 
springy sapling for a ruler. After a 
while I had a whole collection of 
saplings of various lengths and 
thicknesses. 

You draw the rough outlines, 
then spring the batten — in this case 
one of the saplings — across the im- 
portant points. That makes a smooth 
fair curve. It was the way the 
Wright Brothers designed airplanes, 
and it was the way the Douglas 
Gooney Bird was designed. It 
wasn’t until World War II, long af- 
ter the age of flight was underway, 
that airplanes were designed on 
drafting tables. Before that they 
were done on the loft floors, the 
same way that boats were designed 
for centuries.

GALAXY 




I don’t know how long it took me 
to get it right. I wasn’t in any hur- 
ry, and Benito never tried to rush 
me. After a while he even de- 
veloped some enthusiasm. 

Did you ever try to set up ribs 
and make them keep their shape by 
tying them with vines? When the 
ribs are whatever you can cut off 
swamp willows? As a lesson in 
patience the job has few equals . 

Eventually it looked like a glider. 
The wings weren’t precisely sym- 
metrical, and the control surfaces 
pivoted on wooden bearings with 
dowels shaped by flint knives and 
thrust into holes enlarged by flint 
drill bits; the fabric was sewn with 
vine tendrils shoved through holes 
poked with a thom; but it looked 
like a glider. 

I remember the Cargo Cults of 
the South Seas. 

The islanders had been sorry to 
see the airplanes go after World 
War II ended. Native magicians had 
made mockups of airplanes and 
landing fields. It was sympathetic 
magic intended to bring back the 
real airplanes and the great days of 
cargo and trade. I told Benito about 
the Cargo Cults, amusing him great- 
ly, and only later realized what had 
brought them to mind. 

What I was building would never 
look like more than a crude imita- 
tion of an airplane. But it would 
fly! 

I spent as much time making 
tools as I did working on the 
sailplane. A bow drill: take one 
bow, as for shooting arrows; get a 
good curve in it, and instead of an 
arrow, take a piece of sapling. 
Wrap the bowstring around the 
piece of sapling. Attach the drillbit 

INFERNO 



to one end. You need a hard block 
in which the top of the sapling- 
chunk will rotate freely because 
you’ve worn a depression in it. 
Hold that block in one hand, put the 
drill point where you want it, and 
draw the bow back and forth with 
the other hand. The sapling turns. 
The point turns. In about a week 
you can drill a hole. 

I’d heard that boat builders in 
Asia preferred their bowdrills to 
American electrics. They must have 
been crazy. 

I worked. There were no distrac- 
tions. The Builders must have al- 
tered my body radically. I didn’t get 
hungry, thirsty, homy, or sleepy, 
and I never had to go to the bath- 
room. I wondered what I had be- 
come. What was my power source 
now? A power source with no food 
intake and no waste outlet? If it was 
beamed power, Benito and I would 
be turning ourselves off when we 
dropped the glider beyond the wall. 

Beyond the wall ... I hadn’t 
thought much about that. What 
would we find outside? Dante had 
described a dark wood, a wilder- 
ness. Why not? A low gravity 
world, native vegetation allowed to 
run wild . 

No guarantees, Carpentier. There 
might be nothing but Infemoland it- 
self, a tremendous cone built in air- 
less space, with a point-mass, a 
quantum black hole for instance, 
mounted at the tip to provide gravi- 
ty. In that case we were dead. 

I kept working. 

And eventually, there it was. The 
Fudgesickle, by Carpentier and 
Company. “This is a demo, 
madam. The finished model will 
have many other desirable features, 

91 




such as landing gear and seats for 
the crew, and metal fastenings. 

“Will that hold together?” Be- 
nito didn’t seem particularly wor- 
ried. His tone was more one of 
abstract curiosity. 

“I think so. We shouldn’t put 
much strain on it, but I’ve noticed 
we don’t weigh what we should. In- 
femoland seems to be built on a 
lower gravity planet than Earth.” 

“Yours is die most curious delu- 
sion I have yet encountered here. 
Well, if it will- fly, we may as well 
try it. The sooner you are done with 
this idiocy, the sooner we can reach 
the center and escape.” 

I could have killed him. So the 
Fudgesickle wasn’t a thing of beau- 
ty. It would fly! And it was a lot 
better way out than his. 

I didn’t try to kill him for three 
reasons. First, he’d break my neck. 
Second, He had been useful as a 
guide; he’d gotten me the fabric. 
Third, I needed his help getting the 
Fudgesickle high enough on that 
cliff above us for a launching. 

We pulled the glider up the slope 
and carried it until the land fell 
away as a steep cliff. The swamp 
bubbled like sludge, with sickly 
lights glowing among the odd- 
shaped bushes and trees. 

“If we crash down there, we’ll 
never get out,” I said. “Can you 
fly this thing?” 

“I have flown them.” Benito 
laughed, with real humor. 

“What?” 

“I have done this before. We 
launched the glider from a much 
higher cliff. An Austrian soldier 
came to get me out of a sticky situ- 
ation.” He settled himself at the 
controls. 

92 



Something familiar about that 
story . but Benito was looking 
out at the swamp and I didn’t ask 
him. He looked awfully big and 
heavy to be a glider pilot, and I had 
to remember that we didn’t weigh 
what we should. I strained against 
the fusilage and shoved outward. 

It wouldn’t have worked if we 
hadn’t been massless or nearly so. 
Even then I kept wondering about 
that. It chewed at my soul die way 
a ragged tooth attracts the tongue. 
How could we have weight and no 
mass? The wrong weight, and . 

Infernoland. Disneyland of the 
Damnedable. How long had they 
kept me in that bottle? Clarke’s 
Law kept running through my head, 
an old axiom of science fiction. 
‘Any sufficiently advanced technol- 
ogy is indistinguishable from 
magic. ’ 

In my time it would take magic, 
the supernatural, to make that many 
people, not weightless, but mass- 
less. It wasn’t even possible in 
theory to extract the inertia and 
leave the weight. But they could do 
it, the Builders, the God Corpora- 
tion. Why? It must have cost a lot. 
Just how big a paying audience did 
they have? 

Who was watching us now? 

I heaved against the plane: and 
then there was no room for thought. 
The plane dropped like a rock, with 
me hanging onto the tail, crawling 
forward to get into the rear seat. 
Benito knew how to fly, all right. 
He let us dive, just missing the 
cliff, until we had built up speed; 
then he leveled out, taking us above 
the swamp and toward the red-hot 
city. 

Dis. Dante had described it, 

GALAXY 




glowing with red-hot mosques, with 
demons on the walls to guard it. I 
didn’t see any demons. I’d take 
them on faith. If the Builders could 
build Minos, they could make de- 
mons. 

We were about a hundred feet 
above the swamp, and keeping 
steady altitude. There must have 
been warm air rising from the hell- 
ish brew below us. Then we were 
over the wall, and Benito banked 
sharply left to catch the updraft. 
The plane rose steadily, gliding 
along the gentle curve of the wall. 

Benito shouted, “This won’t do 
any good, you know.” 

“We’re getting higher, aren’t 
we?” I pointed down. The swamp 
had shrunk until I could see the 
gentle curve of the cliff beyond it. 
Cliff and red-hot wall were concen- 
tric arcs of circles. 

The view to the right went down 
forever. Beyond what seemed the 
biggest maze ever built, steam rose 
in a thick curtain. Through wind- 
torn rents in the steam I could 
glimpse factories belching out ugly 
black dirt, a line of electric pylon 
towers, a yellow glow of de- 
sert ... on and on, down and 
down. 

What had it all cost? Thousands 
of times as much as Disneyland. 
What kind of people would build 
Infemoland and people it with un- 
willing damned souls? 

If this worked out, I would never 
know. 

We were higher than the cliffs to 
our left. It seemed that we had 
climbed fast, faster than we had any 
right to. But we were nearly weight- 
less and completely massless. The 
plane had only its own structural 

INFERNO 



weight to lift. We continued to rise 
until we were in the hideous grey 
fog that served Infemoland for a 
sky. 

It stank: excrement, oil, smog, 
sickness, slaughterhouses, every- 
thing hideous. There wasn’t even 
the honest smell of sweat and locker 
rooms. 

“We’ll have to turn now,” Be- 
nito said. “We can’t stay in the up- 
draft if we can’t find it.” 

“That’s right. Go!” 

We banked left, then straightened 
out. The fog began to thin. We 
were doing it! Passing over the 
rings we’d struggled through. A 
wind full of weightless people 
bounced us about, then let us go. 
We passed over Minos’ palace. It 
was even bigger than I’d thought. 
There was the wall ahead. We were 
going to make it. 

Have at you. Builders! You can't 
keep a science fiction writer in 
Hell! 

Even so, no hero worth writing 
about would have left Infemoland 
with so many questions un- 
answered. He would have led a rev- 
olution against the Builders, and 
never mind the odds. The plane 
would have been for reconnais- 
sance, not escape. 

Heinlein, van Vogt, “Doc” 
Smith, Robert Howard, all the men 
who wrote of mighty heroes: what 
would they think of me now? Who 
cares? Go, Carpentier! Go, go! 

The villas of the First Circle slid 
below us. 

And suddenly we were losing al- 
titude again. The plane dipped sharp- 
ly just over the cold river. I should 
have known it would. “We’re not 
high enoygh!” I shouted. 

93 




“Obviously. What now?” 

“Take us back to the thermals! 
Get up higher, we can try it again.” 
“As you wish.” He didn’t say it 
wouldn’t work. He just banked left, 
into the bowl. Toward the winds. 

Even below the grey fog, Infemo- 
land’s lighting was not good. 
Gloom and night, all the way down. 
Infemoland was a vast funnel, lead- 
ing down, down . down where 
Benito said we had to go. And we 
were flying there. 

Suddenly we were in the winds. 
People flew about us like flurries of 
autumn leaves, some together, some 
alone. Aerial whirlpool ahead, 
which Benito avoided. And off to 
the left a straight updraft, flailing 
human shapes rising helplessly to- 
ward Infemoland’s invisible roof. 
Just before they vanished into the 
grey stinking fog, the air column 
topped out and they streamed away 
to both sides. 

“There,” I said. I pointed. 

Benito shrugged expressively. 
“I’m getting pretty damned tired 
of your defeatist attitude!” 

He banked toward the updraft. 
Suddenly we were rising as in an 
elevator. I caught startled faces, and 
some of the whirling victims tried 
to swim toward us through the air; 
but they were rising faster than we 
were. They couldn’t catch us. I was 
glad. Massless they might be, but if 
I could feel wind roaring past my 
ears and tugging at my hair, then 
people clinging to the wings would 
foul the airstream. We’d all crash. 

We left the updraft and were car- 
ried along with the others. Sure 
enough we were just at the edge of 
the fog, so that we could hardly see 
below. 

94 



This was it! We were as high as 
we’d been above Dis, and much 
closer to the wall. “Now!” I 
shouted. 

Benito even grinned at me as he 
turned toward the wall. This time 
we’d make it! 

As he banked, something bulky 
hit him in the face and knocked him 
back into the seat, then slipped past 
and wrapped itself around me. I 
struggled to rip it off, and it fought 
back. We’d picked up a passenger. 

“Let me at the controls! I used to 
be a glider pilot!” The hitchhiker 
pulled himself off me and scram- 
bled into the other seat. 

Benito didn’t resist. “Let him 
fly,” he said. 

The plane turned sickeningly. We 
had lost altitude. I could see over 
the stranger’s shoulder: cliffside, 
swampland, a glowing red line — 

A tailspin, and we were beyond 
the place of the winds, headed back 
into the inner circles of Infemoland. 

He pulled us out of the spin. Noth- 
ing subtle about it. He just stopped 
the spin with the ailerons, then 
pulled back on the tailflaps and 
hung on. Presently we were flying 
level again, headed toward the 
swamp. The stranger looked back at 
us, showing a lean, cheerful face 
beneath short, wind-tossed hair. 
“Where to?” 

“Up and out. Over the wall.” 

“Good thinking, but there’s a 
problem.” He waved toward the 
cliff. We were well below the level 
of the winds. 

I said, “There are red-hot walls 
down there. Good thermals. We’ll 
spiral around them until we’re high 
enough, then get back into the 
winds — ” 



GALAXY 




“Not me.” 

“We have to! There are updrafts 
in the winds. Before you interfered 
we were high enough to get out of 
this place.” 

“Down is correct,” Benito said. 

“Not the way you mean!” 

He shrugged. “It is the only way 
we can go now.” 

“No question about that.” We 
headed out over the swamp again, 
feeling the rising air that was just 
strong enough to keep us level. If 
we didn’t find an updraft we’d 
crash in the swamp. 

The trouble was, we were look- 
ing for something invisible. You 
can’t see a wind, you can only see 
what it does. I was looking for heat 
turbulence, or formations that might 
break a horizontal airstream and 
send it upwards; anything. There’d 
been no problem spotting updrafts 
when the wind was full of actors or 
draftees or whatever they were. 

Ahead through the murk we 
could see the cherry-red glow of the 
walls of Dis. It looked a bit like the 
first sight of a town in the middle 
of the Nevada desert, and for a 
moment I thought of food and cof- 
fee and one-armed bandits, and 
girls . 

We were over a hot-spot in the 
swamp. A shape rose from the 
murk and shook a fist at us. He had 
a big bushy Afro hairdo. He lost in- 
terest when another man in a vo- 
luminous white gown and high 
pointed cap rose up to scream at 
him. They were locked in battle 
when we left them. 

“Take it easy,” I told our pilot. 
“I think I saw the left wing bend 
way up when you pulled us out of 
the spin.” 

INFERNO 



“Yeah, I saw it too. What did 
you build this thing out of.” 

I told him. He looked uneasy. I 
asked, “What kind of gliders are 
you used to?” 

“Hypersonic.” 

“Eh?” said Benito. 

“Huh?” I said. 

The stranger chortled. “Jerome 
Leigh Corbett, at your service. I 
was a space shuttle pilot. I had a 
dozen flights on my record, and 
then . You ever have one of those 
days?” 

“Damned right,” I said. Benito 
laughed and nodded. 

We seemed to have enough 
alititude to reach the hot walls. 
They were close enough that we 
could make out details through the 
murk and the red glow. Corbett 
seemed to know what he was doing. 

There were ripples in the dark 
mud below. A hand thrust itself 
upward, middle finger extended. 
There was no movement in the 
cobwebs and slimy moss hanging 
from the bushes, no wind, nothing; 
only the ripples in the mud. 

“One of those days,” Corbett 
said. “First, a twenty-six hour hold 
while we replaced one of the solid 
boosters. That was only irritating. 
We lost one of the three main 
motors going up. Then after we 
made orbit one of the fuel tank 
clamps jammed. Either of you know 
what a space shuttle looks like?” 

I said I did. Benito said he 
didn’t. 

“Well, the tank is big and bulky 
and cheap. We carry the main 
motors down aboard the dart, the 
winged section, but we leave the 
tank to bum up in the atmosphere. 
If we couldn’t get the tank loose 

95 




there wouldn’t have been any point 
in going down.” 

“Did you?” 

“Sure. We fired the orbital 
motors in bursts until the clamp 
sprang open and let us loose. Then 
we had to use more fuel to get back 
to our orbit. We were supposed to 
dump cargo and change orbit, but 
there wasn’t enough fuel. We had 
to go down.” 

Benito was looking totally con- 
fused. It must have been gibberish 
to him. I asked, “What happened?” 

“I don’t know. I spacewalked out 
and looked at the fuel tank clamp. I 
swear there was nothing wrong. But 
maybe the metal fatigued, or maybe 
the hatch over the clamp lock got 
twisted — anyway, we were halfway 
down and going like a meteor when 
we got a burnthrough under the 
nose. I heard the maintenance 
techs — they were the cargo I 
couldn’t jettison — screaming in the 
instrument room, then the whole 
nose peeled back in front of me. I 
woke up by that ferryboat. The 
crowd pushed me along to Minos 
and he threw me in the whirlwind.” 

“And why were you there?” Be- 
nito asked. 

Corbett grinned. “Being a shuttle 
pilot carries a lot of prestige. The 
girls liked me.” 

We were over the walls of Dis 
now, and banked to catch the rising 
air. My seat surged comfortingly 
against me . and the left wing 
bent in the middle. The Fudgesickle 
turned on its side and dropped. 

Corbett dropped the nose. The 
wing, relieved of pressure, straight- 
ened out. But when he tried to pull 
up it bent again. We’d have been 
better off if the loose section had 

96 



ripped away, but it hung on, drag- 
ging us back. 

Corbett did his best. He tried to 
fly with the broken wing, the flap 
raised high on the right wing to 
compensate. We got some lift that 
way, but there wasn’t any doubt: 
we were going to crash. 

Inside the walls of Dis there were 
tombs. Dozens, hundreds, thou- 
sands of tombs, some glowing red 
hot, others dark. The whole land- 
scape was littered with them. 

On the walls themselves were — 
beings. They didn’t look much like 
the cute little devils in Disney car- 
toons. They raged at us, and Cor- 
bett, seeing them, dove for speed to 
get out of their sight. 

The wing folded entirely. Corbett 
played the controls like a virtuoso at 
an organ, heading out over the 
tombs and toward a steamy clear 
area beyond and below them, but 
we were too low, and falling lower, 
into the tombs — 

We dropped into their midst. The 
plane kissed the top of one tomb, 
bounced, and smashed nose on 
against a wall of red hot iron. 



xm 

Flame roared up around me, as 
if a fuel tank had caught. I pulled 
myself loose and rolled out, clawing 
frantically with my hands as the 
flames washed over me. When I 
tried to get to my hands and knees 
my right leg wouldn’t work. I pulled 
myself along the ground, drag- 
ging the useless leg behind me, 
whimpering with fear while the fire 
raged behind and the air I breathed 
grew unbearably hot.

I didn’t stop until I was forty feet 
away. My fingernails were tom and 
my hands cut on the flinty ground. I 
rolled over onto my back to look 
behind me, afraid to look at my leg, 
knowing I’d have to. What I done 
to myself? 

Someone was screaming. 

I ignored the deep throbbing in- 
coherent pain in my leg to look 
back at the crashed glider. Benito 
had been thrown clear in the crash. 
Now he was running back toward 
the glider. 

Corbett was trapped in the wreck- 
age, rammed up against the red- 
hot iron tomb, screaming like a 
damned soul. I didn’t even consider 
trying to get him out. He’d be dead 
in seconds. His skin would already 
have charred away, and he was 
breathing superheated air and 
smoke. How could he scream like 
that with seared lungs? He was. a 
dead man 

Benito hadn’t thought of that. He 
ran straight back into the flames. I 
watched in disbelief as he pulled at 
Corbett’s arm, getting nowhere, 
while fire roared about him. Benito 
took flaming wreckage in his hands 
and heaved it away, clawing to get 
Corbett out. 

Idiot! He’d leave me stranded 
here, my leg ruined, with no guide 
and no one to help me! I sat up and 
tried to go to his aid, but agony 
flashed in my leg. I had to look 
down. 

I stared at two splintered ends of 
red-and-white bone protruding 
through my thigh. Bright blood 
spurted through the tom skin. Arte- 
rial bright, impossibly red. I 
couldn’t take my eyes away. 

Once before I’d broken a bone. 

INFERNO 



I’d caught a football wrong in high 
school, and a knuckle had cracked. 
It had made me sick, not just the 
pain, but the thought of that broken 
thing inside me. I could hardly walk 
to the clinic. Now I stared at two 
ends of a broken thighbone while 
my life’s blood jetted out with each 
pulse. I expected to faint. But noth- 
ing happened, and presently I 
thought of making a toumequet be- 
fore all my blood was gone. 

There was only my robe. I gripped 
the hem in my teeth and pulled 
with both hands. It wouldn’t tear, 
and wouldn’t tear, and bright blood 
jetted in the air. 

Benito! I was lying with a broken 
bone and a terrible wound, but I 
could be saved! Why was Benito 
wasting his time on a hopeless case, 
a man he’d barely met, a hitch- 
hiker? It wasn’t fair. 

Corbett was still screaming as 
Benito tore at the wreckage. Where 
did the pilot find the strength? He 
should be finished, lungs burned 
out, heart stopped, but he went on 
screaming mechanically as if the 
sounds of pain were being ripped 
out of him. 

The pilot came loose suddenly 
and they both went sprawling 
backward. Benito got up and 
dragged the pilot over to me. Benito 
was parboiled and hairless, his 
hands blistered and burned. Corbett 
was a charred corpse, black from 
end to end, with bloodrare steak 
showing through cracks in the char. 
There were no eyes left in the sock- 
ets. And still sounds came through 
the swollen blackened lips. 

“Stupid!” I said. “Stupid, 
stupid, stupid! In a minute he’ll be 
dead anyway!” 



97 




“He will heal,” said Benito. 
“He is dead already.’’ 

■‘Heal?" 

“Certainly.” 

Agony surged in my leg. I looked 
down . and couldn’t look away. 
I watched in helpless fascination. 

The blood had stopped pumping. 
The bone ends gradually vanished 
as skin crawled out to cover them. 
It crawled on, closing the wound, 
leaving my leg in an odd tented 
shape. Without my willing it the leg 
straightened slowly. 

An old scar I’d once got fishing 
slowly reappeared where before 
there had been bloody jagged bone 
end. The pain turned to a ferocious 
itch. That went away too. 

I was healed. 

Corbett had stopped screaming. 
Now he only moaned softly. I 
looked, afraid to look, afraid not to. 
The char was flaking off him in 
thick patches. The skin beneath was 
bright sunbum red, not at all like 
raw meat. His tattoo, like my scar, 
came up from underneath his skin 
like a self-developing photograph. 
He groaned again, and opened his 
eyes. 

There were eyes in the sockets. 
Corbett looked at me and smiled 
weakly. “Can’t die again, I guess. 
Wished I could for a time there.” 

“It is a pointless and evil wish,” 
said Benito. “The dead cannot 
die.” 

“No.” Corbett began an inspec- 
tion of his body. 

I stood up uncertainly. Benito 
watched, saying nothing. I was able 
to stand. I could walk. I did. I went 
off a way, toward the glowing 
tomb, until the heat was nearly un- 
bearable, and I stared at it. 

98 



We’ll have to change our theory, 
won’t we, Carpentier? Corbett’s no 
robot. The Builders would have had 
to put new, sunburned skin under 
the skin to be charred. They would 
have had to plan all this ahead of 
time. They would have to be omnis- 
cient. 

And what about your leg, Car- 
pentier? What about your leg? 

Biological engineering. Rapid re- 
generation. That, to add to their 
other powers. They can warp space, 
and possibly time. They can take 
the mass from a human body and 
leave the weight. They can put 
Minos’ tail into — where? Hyper- 
space? They’ve got fine-tuned 
weather control and infinitely adapt- 
able robots. 

And they can engineer your 
body, Carpentier, your body, in 
such a way that it heals in minutes, 
and do it without your knowing 
they gave you that ability. 

Getting a little thin, isn’t it, Car- 
pentier? A neat set of rationaliza- 
tions, but it won’t work. How are 
these Builders different from God 
Himself? What can God do that 
they can’t? 

And back at the edge of my mind 
I couldn’t help remembering the last 
thing I’d screamed in the bottle. 

Corbett had got up and was peel- 
ing saucer-sized flakes of charred 
skin from his chest and shoulders. 
“Hot here,” he said. 

I nodded and abandoned my rev- 
erie. 

It was hot. Even the tombs 
that weren’t glowing were just be- 
low red heat. Here and there flames 
shot up from open pits. It must 
have been painful for Corbett with 
his new skin. 



GALAXY 




I remembered where we were. 
Inside the walls of Dis. How were 
we to get out again? We were sur- 
rounded by hot glowing tombs, 
flames, fire, heat everywhere, ex- 
cept in one direction where darkness 
showed through the red glow. 

“We have to get out of here,” I 
said to Benito. “We’ll roast to — 
We’ll roast.” To death? We 
couldn’t die. Can’t die twice, Car- 
pentier. 

“Of course we must leave,” Be- 
nito said. “Recall your promise. I 
helped you with the glider, and it 
did not work. Now you have no 
choice. We go downward.” 

“Which way?” For that moment 
I didn’t care. 

“I am not sure. We may as well 
go where it is more comfortable.” 
He led us off toward the dark. It 
drew us onward, promising relief 
from the heat and the choking air. 
We threaded our way between 
heated tombs and great vat-like pits 
with fire dancing from them. Huge 
lids that would just cover them lay 
beside each one. 

The edge of the hot region was 
the beginning of a white marble 
maze. The heat stopped as if we’d 
gone through an insulated doorway, 
but there was no door. I wasn’t 
even surprised. It would take more 
than invisible heat barriers to sur- 
prise me now. 

Corbett staggered into a corridor 
and sank down with a happy sigh, 
his back against cool marble. He 
wriggled to get his head clear of the 
brass fixtures. 

We were in an endlessly sprawl- 
ing building. The corridors were 
about fifteen feet wide and nearly 
that high. Every wall was covered 

INFERNO 



with square-cut marble slabs and 
rows of brass plates and slender 
brass . what? Vases? I read 
some of the plates. Name, birth- 
date, date of death. Sometimes an 
insipid poem. These were burial 
vaults, and those brass things were 
vases, and of course there were no 
flowers in them. The corridor 
stretched on endlessly, and there 
seemed to be branches at frequent 
intervals. Millions of tombs . 

“More unbelievers,” I said. 

“Yes,” Benito answered. 

“But I was an unbeliever. An 
agnostic.” 

“Of course.” 

“Why of course?” 

, “I found you in the Vestibule,” 
said Benito. “But now you know 
the truth.” 

A two-syllable response stuck in 
my throat. The truth was an elusive 
thing, here in Infemoland. I could 
talk about advanced technologies 
until Hell froze over, and Benito 
would still call them miracles. 

I’d watched a miracle. A com- 
pound fracture had healed before 
my eyes. And I was no robot! 

Rut this place had to be artificial. 
It was a construct, a design. I knew 
that. 

All right, Carpentier. An artifact 
implies an artificer. There has to be 
a designer. Pick a Chief Engineer 
for the Builders, and call him 
. what? Good fannish names, 
like Ghod, Ghu, Roscoe, the 
Ceiling? No. Call him Big Juju. 

Question, Carpentier. In what 
way do Big Juju’s abilities differ 
from God Almighty’s? 

Size? This place is the size of a 
small planet. Carpentier, you’ve no 
way of knowing Big Juju can’t 

99 




build even bigger. Worlds, stars, 
whole universes. 

Natural laws? He suspends them 
at will. A world-sized funnel, as sta- 
ble as a sphere would be in normal 
space. And — and he can raise the 
dead. Me! Corbett, who couhdn’t 
possibly have been frozen. Jan Petri 
the health food addict, cremated, 
Carpentier, burned to a pile of 
greasy ashes and a few chunks of 
bone, and now risen so that he can 
be tortured. 

Big Juju can create. He can de- 
stroy. He can raise the dead and 
heal the sick. Was more ever 
claimed for Christ? 

I looked back at the red-hot 
tombs. They still glowed with heat, 
but none of that reached us in these 
cool marble halls. “There are 
people in those tombs?’ ’ 

Benito nodded. “Heretics.” 

The word was frightening. Here- 
tics. They believed in the wrong 
gods, or worshipped the right god 
in the wrong way. For that they 
were raised from the dead so they 
could be tortured in hotboxes. 

Iago says it. ‘Credo in un Dio 
cruel.’ I believe in a cruel God. 
And that you must believe, Carpen- 
tier. The ability to make a universe 
does not presuppose moral superior- 
ity. We have seen no strong evi- 
dence that Big Juju’s moral judge- 
ments are better than our own. 
Would God torture people? 

I half-remembered Sunday school 
lessons. No. But also, yes. It was 
one reason I was an agnostic. How 
could I worship a God Who kept a 
private dungeon called Hell? That 
might be all right for Dante 
Alighieri, a Renaissance Italian, 
but Carpentier has higher standards! 

100 



A voice floated from within my 
mind, a tired voice whispering out 
of a mound of fat. We're in the 
hands of. infinite power and infinite 
sadism. 

We were in the private museum 
park of Big Juju. “We’ve got to get 
out of here.” 

“Too right,” said Corbett. He 
paused. “Music?” 

I listened. There was music play- 
ing from somewhere within these 
marble corridors. Something chintzy- 
sweet, a minor note in it. Arti- 
ficial good cheer in Hell. 

“It fits,” I said. “Granted we’re 
damned, how do we get out? Which 
way?” 

Benito looked around him. “I 
have never been in this part be- 
fore.” 

“Not back out there,” Corbett 
insisted. “Not unless we have to.” 

“Right. We’ve got time,” I said. 
And I started laughing. 

It was an awful sound. It 
bounced around in the maze and 
came back at me from all direc- 
tions, transmuted to racking sobs. I 
tried to stop. Corbett and Benito 
were staring. I tried to tell them: 

“I was right. Just once, I was 
right. All that time in the bottle, all 
that guessing, and I was right just 
once. Immortality! When they woke 
me up they had immortality.” 
Dammit, I was crying. 

Corbett took my arm. “Come on, 
Allen.” 

We went inward. 

XIV 

The corridors branched away, 
endless cross-corridors in an endless 
corridor, and every one of them the 

GALAXY 




same, wall after wall of marble- 
sealed caskets, each with its empty 
bronze vases for flowers. Our 
footsteps echoed hollowly. Our san- 
dals hadn’t been touched by the 
flames. The sprightly music con- 
tinued, never getting louder, and the 
light never changed, neither gloomy 
nor bright. On and on, corridor af- 
ter corridor. Finally we halted. 

“We haven’t turned,” I said. 
Corbett nodded. “Do a one- 
eighty and we can get out of here. 
Let’s.” 

Half-facetiously I rapped on a 
bronze nameplate and read off the 
name and dates. A translucent hu- 
man shape formed before me. I 
stared in horror, then shrugged. 
What was a ghost among ghosts? 

“Pardon me,” I said. “Can you 
direct us toward the wall of Dis?” 
The ghost’s voice was faint and 
reedy. “Wall? Dis?” Faint laugh- 
ter. “They must have added more 
extensions to the Mausoleum. I 
don’t remember anything like that 
in Forest Lawn.” 

“Very funny. This isn’t Forest 
Lawn.” 

The ghost seemed vexed. “I was 
supposed to be buried in Forest 
Lawn. I paid for it before I died. It 
was in my will. Where am I?” 
“Would you believe Hell?” 

More faint laughter, as if from a 
great distance. “Certainly not. I 
don’t even believe in ghosts.” And 
then there was nothing but the wall. 

I jumped when Corbett spoke be- 
hind me. “It’s a risk, but are you 
game to try a cross-corridor? I think 
if we turn left and keep going 
straight we’ll be headed up again. 

The scenery changed. Now 

INFERNO 



there were niches with urns in 
them, much closer together. We 
came to a T-intersection, and 
turned, and returned to the right di- 
rection when we could. Then 
another T, and a Y, and a big round 
empty space with corridors off in all 
directions and a big monument in 
the very center . 

. and we were in the good 
section of town. The sarcophagi 
were no longer buried in the walls. 
At the ends of short alcoves were 
huge marble oblongs, ornately 
carved, guarded by traditional 
statuary. Knights, and vague sexless 
winged beings that were supposed 
to be angels and might have been 
faggots; reproductions of famous re- 
ligious statuary; original creations, 
all done with enormous compe- 
tence, all in monstrous bad taste. 
Sculpted Bibles open to John 3:16. 
Replicas of European cathedrals, 
done in perfect scale, bronze toys. 

One alcove was blocked off by a 
brass gate and enormous lock. All 
the nameplates were of the same 
family, all ornately carved with re- 
lief pictures and bronze replicas of 
their life’s signatures. We looked 
in, grinned at each other, and went 
on. 

Pride. Unbelievably ornate monu- 
ments purchased at unbelievable 
price: expensive tombs turned 
prison. I wondered if they matched 
monuments left behind on Earth. 
Sure, I decided. Big Juju has a 
sense of fitness. 

Fitness? 

In this one case, yes, fitness. 

The corridors twisted again and 
again. The dead were high walls on 
all sides of us. Our footsteps were 
dull intrusions on music for the 

101 




proud dead. The dead walked 
among the dead. Dead. Dead. 
Dead. Dead! Word and reality 
echoed with each step. Word and 
reality hammered at my soul. Dead. 
Dead. Dead. Presently I sat down 
against cool marble. 

“Allen? What is the trouble?” 
Benito’s anxious voice was far 
away. 

“Come on, let’s get moving. 
This place gives me the creeps.” 
Corbett shoved at me with his toe. 
“C’mon.” 

I tried to speak. It wasn’t worth 
the effort, but finally I heard my 
own voice saying, “We’re dead. 
Dead. It’s all over. We tried to 
make lives for ourselves, and we 
didn’t make it, and we’re dead. Oh, 
Corbett, I wish I’d died like you.” 

The gay sweet music mocked me. 
Dead. Dead. Dead. 

Green light blinked on and off in 
the comer of my eye. It was annoy- 
ing, a disturbance, an irritant in the 
thick cotton closing about me. I 
could see the source without turning 
my head, but it was an effort to 
move my eyes. Why bother? But 
the light winked on and off, and 
eventually I looked at the source, a 
neon sign blinking far down at the 
dead end of a corridor of the dead. 
It echoed my thought: 

SO IT GOES 
SO IT GOES 
SO IT GOES 

— off and on, endlessly, in green 
neon. 

Unreachably far away, on another 
world, in another time, Allen Car- 
pentier had been buried like a 
potato in a closed coffin ceremony. 

102 



The fans had come to the funeral, 
some of them, and a few writers 
had come, and afterward they’d 
gone off to have a drink and talk 
about new writers. Carpentier was 
dead, and that was all there was to 
it. I could speculate forever about 
Big Juju’s moral superiority, I could 
wander forever through Hell, and so 
what? 

SO IT GOES 
SO IT GOES 

Corbett’s voice came dimly. “We 
may have to leave him. I saw this 
happen to a guy, once, in the war. 
He’s going autistic.” 

“I have seen it also. Many times. 
Would you leave him here?’ ’ 

I thought Benito was shaking my 
shoulder. 

SO IT GOES 
SO IT GOES 
SO IT GOES 

— what was a blinking neon sign 
doing in this place? 

A horrible suspicion filtered 
through the blankets around my 
brain. I pushed Benito away and 
surged to my feet. I walked, wob- 
bling, toward the blinking light. So 
it goes? 

At the end of the corridor was a 
tremendous square-cut edifice in 
black marble. The epitaph beneath 
the neon sign was long and wordy, 
couched in words of one syllable 
and short, sirpple sentences. A 
man’s life history, a list of books 
and awards — 

Corbet and Benito stared when I 
came back. Corbett said, “You 
look like you’re ready to kill some- 
body.” 

I jerked my thumb behind me. At 
first I couldn’t speak, I was that an- 
gry. “Him. Why him? A science 

GALAXY 




fiction writer who lied about being 
a science fiction writer because he 
got more money that way. He wrote 
whole novels in baby talk, wjjh 
sixth grade drawings in them, and 
third grade science, and he knew 
better. How does he rate a monu- 
ment that size?” 

Benito’s smile was lopsided. 
‘‘You envy him that tomb?” 

“If you must know, I was writ- 
ing better than he ever did before I 
left high school!” 

“Being dead hasn’t hurt your 
ego,” said Corbett. “Good. We 
thought we’d lost you.” 

“He’s got vases bigger than the 
bottle they put me in!” 

“You were an agnostic. Selfish, 
but not viciously so,” Benito said. 
“If I judge rightly from the size of 
his tomb, he must have founded his 
own religion. And possibly wor- 
shipped himself.” 

“No, they were jokes, sort of. 
But he did found at least two, not 
that there were ever any followers, 
or that he even intended there to be. 
One of them had everyone telling 
comforting lies to everyone else. 
The other was the Church of God 
the Fairly Competent. Maybe I 
should have gone in for something 
like that.” 

“Why didn’t you?’’ Corbett 
asked. 

“Because what’s the point of 
mocking people who’ve found 
something to believe in.” I turned 
toward the big, gaudy edifice. 
" That’s the point.” 

Benito shook his head wondering- 
ly. “I question your sanity. He is in 
there. You are out here, free to es- 
cape.” 

I didn’t answer, but he was right. 

INFERNO 



We turned away. For a time I could 
see the green reflection blinking 
ahead of us. 

SO IT GOES 

were lost in endless cor- 
ridors of the dead. Benito walked in 
stolid patience, but Corbett’s face 
had acquired a grim, set look, des- 
peration barely held in check. I kept 
my own thoughts to myself. 

But I remembered Big Juju’s abil- 
ity to distort space and time. 

We’d come a long way. Perhaps 
there was no way out. 

And what if we did get out of the 
maze? 

Benito said we had all eternity. 
Eternity in Infemoland. Or in Hell. 
Big Juju or God, it didn’t matter; 
the problem was to escape. 

I’d built a glider once, and it had 
flown. Get me through the wall, get 
me fabric for the wings, and I’d do 
it again. 

But I’d have to do it without Be- 
nito. 

You promised you’d go with him, 
Carpentier. Down to the center, out 
his way. You can keep your word, 
or you can break it; but if you 
break it, it’ll be without his help. 

Suppose he’s crazy? Or an agent 
for Big Juju? 

Then you’re on your own. 

Nuts. Benito might be able to 
trick the damned bureaucrats into 
giving us whatever we wanted. I 
couldn’t kid myself I’d be able to. 
Fabric I could get — at worst, by 
peeling it off catatonics — but how 
to get through the wall? I’d seen 
demons on the rim. More demons 
guarded the gate. 

I glanced sideways at Benito. 

103 




Stolid patience, and iron faith in 
God and the maps of Dante 
Alighieri. And Carpentier’s given 
word. If we ever got out of this 
maze, he’d go down. We could fol- 
low or not. 

I felt heat ahead. We turned a 
comer and found a wall of red-hot 
ums. The floor seemed to slant up- 
hill. 

Corbett whooped. “This way! To 
the wall!” His voice sounded out of 
place in the Mausoleum. 1 waited 
for Benito to protest, but he said 
nothing, and I wondered if he knew 
something we didn’t. 

“We could make quite a safari,” 
Corbett shouted. He was over-joyful 
at finding a way out. “Just open 
these ums and pour out the ashes.” 
“I went further than that, once,” 
Benito told us. “I attempted to es- 
tablish a local government.” 

“Didn’t work?” 

“No.” 

“Why?” 

There was no answer. It became 
apparent that there wouldn’t be one. 
Something else to think about. 

We hit a T-corridor and were 
back in cool marble. We followed it 
a short way, anxious lest we find 
ourselves back in the endless tombs. 
It turned left again. I rounded the 
turn ahead of the others and found 
myself facing red heat. I shaded my 
eyes — 

“Your papers, please?” 

I squinted through my fingers. 

I faced a towering wall of red hot 
iron, with a divided door in it. 
There was a counter on the lower 
closed half of the door, and some- 
one behind it, half-hidden in the 
dark interior framed by bright red 
light. He held a stack of papers. 

104 



The bored face showed no sign of 
recognition. It might have been the 
same clerk or a different one. 

“Papers? Come on, I haven’t got 
all eternity.” He pushed the stack 
of papers toward me. “You’ll have 
to make these out before you can go 
uphill. It’s in the Rules.” 

I backed around the comer. To 
the questioning looks of the others I 
said, “Don’t ask. Just turn around.” 
We went back the way we’d 
come, looking for a right turn. Pres- 
ently we found it, and— 

“Your papers, please?” 

I walked toward the booth, but I 
was studying the gate behind the 
clerk. Iron glowing red, but it was 
only waist high. We could jump it. 

The counter turned white hot as I 
approached. 

“Papers? You’ll have to fill out 
the forms. No exceptions.” 

I looked to Benito. He shrugged 
and turned away. After a moment I 
followed, hating him. He wasn’t go- 
ing to help. 

And he’d known it all along. We 
had to go downhill. 



XV 

The music went with us wherever 
we went: nature themes, melo- 
dramatic sweetness, singing violins, 
but never funeral dirges or somber 
tones. The cheerful music was more 
depressing than any funeral march. 

Gradually I realized we could 
hear something else as well. I don’t 
know if it had been with us the 
whole time, waiting for us to be- 
come aware of it, or if it began as 
we threaded our way deeper into 
Hell. 



GALAXY 




The sounds came from the tombs. 
Groaning. Whimpers. Croaks of 
rage. Mumbled curses. Once even 
gay whistling, a tune that jarred 
against the canned music. 

Gradually the clammy air 
warmed. It was our first sign that 
we were moving out of the maze. 

We followed currents of warming 
air. Where the air turned steamy-hot 
we found a doorway. 

Unnerving sounds reached us 
through the doorway: screams of 
agony tom from throats that could 
contain them no longer, blended 
with animal war cries and the most 
vicious curses I’d ever imagined. 

Corbett plunged ahead, but Be- 
nito caught him. “Carefully,” he 
warned us. 

We looked out and down. The 
ground fell straight away from the 
doorsill, first vertically, then an- 
gling down to a forty-five degree 
slope. The dirt was baked adobe 
with jagged edges of protruding 
flint. 

The bottom of the cliff was 
obscured by steam, much like the 
marsh outside Dis, but this was hot. 
The steam roiled about, leaving oc- 
casional clear patches. Gradually 
the picture formed. 

We were looking at an enormous 
discolored lake. The shore curved 
away to either side until steam hid 
the endpoints. Men and women 
stood waist deep in steamy red wa- 
ter, and they howled. They were 
packed like a public pool on a Kan- 
sas summer Saturday; and they 
wanted out. 

Some tried it, but they didn’t 
make it. Armed men patrolled the 
shore between us and the scarlet 
water. The guards were dressed for 

INFERNO 



a costume ball, in the military garb 
of all places and all times; but they 
walked like sentries whose officers 
are watching. Their eyes were uni- 
formly on the lake, and they held 
weapons ready. 

Weapons: there was every 

hand-weapon known to history. Pis- 
tols, bows, scythes, crossbows, 
throwing-sticks, slings, pikes and 
lances, AS- 15 rifles, all held at the 
ready. When someone attempted to 
leave the lake, the sentries fired. 

I saw a woman in black military 
uniform cut nearly in half by a burst 
from an automatic rifle. She 
shrieked in agony and waded deeper 
into the lake, where she stood, heal- 
ing. 

Healing. The implications of our 
inability to die began to get through 
to me then. 

One man in a long beard wore a 
golden crown on*his head and clus- 
tered crossbow bolts through his 
chest. He was stubborn. He’d move 
toward the shore. The crossbowmen 
would lire, and he’d stagger back, 
the scream hissing through clenched 
teeth. He’d pluck the bolts from his 
chest and throw them contemptu- 
ously into the water — and wade to- 
ward shore again. 

And again. And again. He was a 
fool, but a brave one. 

“I take it the guards won’t be on 
our side,” I whispered. 

Benito shuddered. “No. On the 
contrary, if they catch us, we — ” 
He didn’t finish, but he didn’t have 
to. 

The guards looked silly in those 
costumes. I knew some of them. 
Nazi swastikas and American GI. 
Coldstream Guards and Cameron 
Highlander. Blue and grey of the 

105 




Civil War. World War I helmets. 
Redcoats and the blue-and-buff 
of Washington’s Continentals. 
Fuzzy-wuzzies and Chinese Gor- 
don’s Tommies, and more: Roman 
Legion, Greek hoplite, vaguely 
Asiatic uniforms, long gowns ami 
wicker shields, spears with golden 
apples on the hilts; and more still, 
yellow men in animal fur, red and 
black men in little besides war 
paint, blue men stark naked. Blue? 
Britons in their woad, marching be- 
side Legionaires, followed by men 
and women in coveralls carrying 
tiny machine guns of a variety I’d 
never seen. 

And they watched the lake, con- 
stantly, vigilantly. “They won’t see 
us up here,” I said. “Now what?” 
“We must cross the lake,” said 
Benito. “There is a place, far 
around, where it is only ankle deep. 
Elsewhere it rises to above our 
heads in the deepest parts. The 
damned stand at a depth appropriate 
to the violence they did on Earth.” 
“That water loote hot. It steams.” 
“It is boiling blood.’’ Benito 
laughed without humor. “What 
would you expect for the violent?’ ’ 

A frozen moment stretched end- 
lessly. Then Corbett shouted, “We 
can’t walk into that! No!” 

“Jerry—” 

“I’ve been burned before, re- 
member? We’ll never make it! 
When our ankles are cooked we’ll 
go to our knees. When the legs are 
cooked we’ll be lying in it!” 

“Yet you see that every man and 
woman in the lake is standing.” 

The calm voice halted Corbett’s 
panicky monologue. He looked. I’d 
already seen that Benito was right. 
If they could stand, their cooked 

106 



legs must still be operating. They 
also wouldn’t stop hurting . 

“The gpards will not allow us to 
wander freely in Hell,’’ Benito 
cautioned us. “Without instructions 
regarding our sentence, they may 
well force us to the deepest spot 
and keep us there.- You have noted 
that their weapons do not kill, but 
they can disable.” 

Let’s stay here, Carpentier. I’m 
starting to like the music. 

“They must not notice us. We 
must do as little screaming as pos- 
sible.” Benito spoke seriously, 
without a trace of humor. Benito 
had been in Hell so long that suffer- 
ing was not remarkable to him, or 
even unusual. 

“There may be a better way,” 
Corbett said slowly. He pointed. 
“Allen, what do you see?” 

“An island.” Half-obscured by 
steam, it stood very low in the lake 
a good mile to our right. It was 
more crowded than the water 
around it, the water that Benito said 
was boiling blood. 

Poetic justice. Infinitely exagger- 
ated, as everything was here. No 
doubt the people boiling down there 
were murderers in life, or torturers, 
or kidnappers, arsonists perhaps. 
The violent. Well, at least we knew 
how to get across. “Benito, can we 
cross on the island?” 

He stared pop-eyed, his big 
square jaw thrust forward. “I had 
no idea there was an island in 
Acheron. Dante did not describe 
it.” 

“I suppose he mentioned boiling 
blood?” 

“Of course. He also described 
the ford I used before. The ford is 
heavily guarded, and perhaps the Is- 

GALAXY 




land would be better.” He consid- 
ered. ‘‘Dante did not mention the 
ship in Acheron either.” 

‘‘Ship?” 

‘‘Yes, Allen, a wooden sailing 
ship sunken on the other side of 
Acheron. The decks are just awash 
with blood. I have been aboard it. 
There are grills in the deck, and 
souls beneath the grills.” 

“Slave traders,” Corbett specu- 
lated. 

“Probably,” said Benito. 

But how had Benito been aboard? 
Was that where he had escaped 
from? Or from deeper down? I 
didn’t dare ask, yet how could we 
trust him until we knew his crime? 

How could we not? 

“Slave traders aren’t our prob- 
lem,” Corbett said. “I suppose the 
best plan would be to circle up here 
until we’re just opposite the island, 
then make a run for it.” 

We looked at each other and 
nodded agreement. 

We turned back inside to parallel 
the shore, passing walls of shelves 
packed with crematory ums. I sa- 
vored the cool, damp air. I was go- 
ing to miss it. The cliff-edge was 
just beyond that wall. 

Why bother, Carpentier? Why not 
stay here? 

No. We’ve got to get out of here. 
Minos would track us down, even- 
tually, and then what? We have to 
escape. 

Hey, Carpentier, what makes you 
think there's a way out? 

I don’t want to think about that. 
There has to be a way out. Benito 
says there is. Dante described it — 

A way out for him, yes! A living 
man whose guide called on angels! 

There is a way out of Hell and 

INFERNO 



we’re going to find it, because we 
can’t die trying, because there’s noth- 
ing else to do but sit for eternity. 
Eternity. 

I'm scared, Carpentier. 

Me too. Let’s talk to the others. 
They’re scared like you. Talking 
helps. 

“The guards,” I said. “They 
bother me two ways.” 

Corbett said, “It’s boiling that 
bothers me.” 

“I don’t think I’ll like being shot 
full of arrows and bullets,” I said. 
“But worse than that, what the 
blazes are they doing here?’ ’ 

Corbett just laughed. They were 
guarding, his look said. 

“They did violence they believed 
justified,” said Benito. “They 
fought for what they thought was a 
higher cause.” 

“And there aren’t any soldiers in 
Heaven?” 

“I’m sure there are. But these en- 
joyed their work.” His voice took 
on a note of sadness. “They enjoy 
it still. They do not seek to es- 
cape.” 

“It’s weird. They’re serving the 
Builders, or Big Juju, or God, 
whatever we call the master of this 
place. If they’re serving God they 
ought to be in Heaven!” 

Benito shrugged. “Or Purgatory. 
Perhaps. Theology is not my spe- 
ciality. The next doorway is just 
ahead, be careful.” 

He wouldn’t say more, but I re- 
membered the uniformed servitors 
in Disneyland, and wondered if the 
guards worked in shifts. Did they 
have homes to go to when they got 
off work? Did they go home and 
tell their wives about their day? 

We waited, peeking around the 

107 




door jamb to watch the shore. The 
island was just opposite, no more 
than fifty yards off shore, obscured 
by clouds of steam and no easier to 
see than it had been from a mile 
away. 

A band marched past, robed and 
unarmed. “Inquisition priests,” Be- 
nito murmured. “They would call 
the temporal authorities. The sol- 
diers.” 

They receded. A handful of bar- 
barian women passed, arms and 
shoulders the color of their bronze 
armor. They carried bows and 
shortswords. Behind them was 
another group, also women, wear- 
ing olive-drab fatigues and carrying 
submachineguns. They passed out 
of sight, and the shore was clear. 

“Run,” Benito ordered. 

We ran. There was a ten foot 
drop to the steep slope. I landed on 
my feet and kept running in a half- 
controlled fall. Jagged flint edges 
tore at my feet. When I hit the 
beach I kept running, because I 
knew I’d never be able to walk into 
the boiling lake. The wandering 
clouds of steam wrapped me round, 
hid me from the guardians, and I 
ran toward the chorus of screams. 
The smell was overpowering, fresh 
blood and clotted blood, copper 
bright and polluted foul. 

Corbett was ahead of me. He 
splashed into bubbling red fluid and 
screamed. He stood, covered to his 
knees, screaming in pain. Benito 
plunged in, waded through the stuff 
like a damned robot and gripped 
Corbett’s arm to keep him from 
turning back. Then I was in it my- 
self. I fell into a trench and was in- 
stantly waist deep. 

The pain hit me weirdly, as if I’d 

108 



stuck my finger in a light socket. 
Stunning. Unreal. All my senses 
were scrambled. I knew die smell 
of pain, its sight and sound, and 
there was nothing to see or hear but 
pain. I couldn’t control my limbs. 
They thrashed and twitched, almost 
spilling me full length into the stuff. 

Still jerking like a marionette, I 
turned toward shore. Nothing could 
be worth this much pain. 

Half a squad of Green Berets 
stood there studying us. They had 
friends: small men in black 

pajamas. 

I turned back. We were commit- 
ted now. Through a gap in the 
steamy mist I had seen their eyes: 
dull, expressionless, intent on their 
task; and their task was to let no 
one leave the blood. 

“The island,” I screamed. “To 
the island!” But I didn’t move and 
neither did the others. We stood 
where we were and screamed. 

“The island!” Corbett laughed 
hysterically, laughter and pain and 
horror. “We can’t use the island — ” 

I screamed, “What?” 

“Stupid! Look!” 

He was right. I cursed the rolling 
clouds that had hidden it from view. 
They were shoulder to shoulder 
over every square inch of the is- 
land. I never saw a more vicious 
mob. They were armed haphazard- 
ly, with clubs and crude daggers of 
what seemed to be splintered bone. 
Even as I watched, someone trying 
to climb out of the blood was re- 
pelled by half a dozen stab wounds. 
He staggered away, howling, leav- 
ing a foaming red wake. 

Benito came up to me, still pull- 
ing Corbett by the arm. “We must 
wade around the island.” 



GALAXY 




I couldn’t move. Suddenly he 
took my shoulder in his powerful 
grip, and began to plunge through 
the boiling red, towing both of us 
like children. I remembered his 
strength. There was no point in 
struggling with him. I didn’t want 
to. I wanted out ; but my limbs 
would not obey. The pain was 
paralyzing. 

You could read the agony on Be- 
nito’s face. He hurt as we did. But 
he plunged on. He shouted, 
“Deeper down, there is a place 
where souls are not even allowed to 
cry! Here there is no law against 
screaming!” 

“Yeah! Cheer me up!’’ I 
screamed. 

We halted. There were guards on 
the shore. A man in a high peaked 
hat stared through binoculars. We 
didn’t dare move. 

There are two ways to treat con- 
stant excruciating agony. Both in- 
volve screaming. You may try to 
suppress the screams, and they will 
force their way through your teeth; 
or you can just let it out. Similarly, 
you can concentrate on the source 
of pain and try to minimize it; a 
current of not-quite-boiling blood 
here on the left, get into it! Stand 
on tiptoe, you gain an inch . 

Or you can tell yourself it will 
heal, and concentrate on something 
else. 

There was turmoil on the island. 
People were shouting at one of their 
number. He stood with his feet 
planted wide and his hands raised 
high over his head. The hands held 
the haft of a spear: a length of 
wood that might have been a broken 
oar or a tree sapling, and a leaf- 
shaped blade poised a few inches 

inferno 



above his feet. Poised to strike; but 
at what? Hands reached to shake his 
shoulders, and he snarled in an 
agony different somehow from all 
the moans around him. 

I tried to hear. By now the word- 
less moaning of the thousands of 
waders, even my own, had become 
a background noise, had faded like 
the sickening smell of boiling 
blood. I caught disjointed phrases. 

“Kill ’em! Kill ’em before — ” 

“Billy, if you won’t do it, let us 
through!” 

“Idiot, you hafta, they’ll be all 
around us in a minute — ’ ’ 

The man with the spear bellowed, 
“No!” 

And the ground seemed to erupt 
beneath his feet. 

He kicked at whatever was grip- 
ping his ankles. He kicked himself 
free and ran for the island’s shore. 
Others got out of his way, then 
surged to close the gap. Behind 
him, that portion of the island was 
heaving as in an earthquake, and 
clubs and knives were rising and 
falling with horrible rhythm. 

“Billy” splashed knee deep into 
boiling blood and stopped at once. 
As he sucked air for his first 
shocked scream, three seperate 
hands thrust forward against his 
back. He splashed face down. Two 
surging waves washed against the 
bathers around him. 

He was up in a flash, his spear 
ready for war. I was sure he’d try 
to fight his way back onto the is- 
land. But he didn’t. He turned and 
waded away, in our direction. A 
foot short of my nose he said, 
“Friend, it’s not polite to stare.” 

“Sorry. What happened back 
there? Will they let you back?” 

109 




He glared back at his erstwhile 
neighbors. “Those bastards couldn’t 
stop me." He sounded like he was 
holding his breath ... as we all 
did, because each of us was trying 
to talk around a scream. It was al- 
most funny, that sound. “I . 
never thought it would hurt so 
much,” he said. 

“Why didn’t you stay?” 
“Couldn’t take the killing.” 
“What?” 

Benito and Corbett had crowded 
close to listen. “Billy” studied me, 
his face contorted in agony. “Don’t 
know about the island, do you?” 

I shook my head. The Afrika 
Korps had gone, but curaissiers 
with muskets had replaced them. 
We still dared not move. 

“We on the island, we killed 
people, just like you in the swim- 
ming hole. But we all had some ex- 
cuse, some reason we had to kill. 
Like me. There was a range war go- 
ing on. We wasn’t even the ones 
that started it.” 

I said, “Yeah?” 

He took it wrong. “You think 
maybe we could have stopped it? 
Gone along with the amnesty?” 

I didn’t know what he was talk- 
ing about, and didn’t much care. 
His blue eyes had turned killer in 
that moment. I said, “Don’t mind 
me. I’m in Hell too.” 

That calmed him, and changed 
him. He was younger than me and 
shorter than me, and the short 
amateurish haircut gave him a 
pleasant boyish look. Though the 
hair was plastered down with 
blood . “Then’ there’s Harry 
Vogel,” he continued, “he was 
robbing a liquor store and the owner 
pulled his mask off. He’d seen his 

110 



face, so he had to die, see? And 
Rich and Bonny Anderson, they 
kidnapped a kid, and it would have 
been okay, but he got away. Got as 
far as a great big street called a 
freeway, .then some kind of machine 
hit him.” He looked down, then 
continued talking, hurriedly, as if 
that would block the pain. “Bon- 
nie’s here, Rich isn’t. Rich got re- 
ligion. Hey, we got Aaron Burr on 
the island! And that guy who ran 
the Andersonville prison camp — ” 

“I get the idea. If they thought 
they had to do it, they don’t get 
hurt as bad.” 

“Yeah.” Billy looked down at 
his waist. “It hurts. I think this 
hurts as much as anything I ever did 
except die. But I wouldn’t go back. 
No.” But he looked back and 
wasn’t sure. He said it again. “No! 
I won’t ever kill anyone again!” 
“That’s twice you’ve — ” 

“Well, that island ain’t any 
common dirt, you know. It’s mostly 
judges and congressmen and 
lawyers and a few jury members 
and crooked sheriffs — ” 

“Wait! Wait!” I remembered the 
island surging up around him. “The 
island’s people? Live people?” 

I swear he was enjoying my reac- 
tion. “Yeah. We have to keep ’em 
crippled. It’s what Minos does to 
them for letting known killers loose 
on the public that was paying them 
to protect them. Some was jury 
members that took bribes, and 
lawyers that fiddled with the evi- 
dence, and congressmen that passed 
laws against putting a man in jail if 
the evidence wasn’t got in a special 
kind of way ... I don’t know. 
That kind of law is all new to me. 
The island was a lot smaller when I 

GALAXY 




first came here.” 

‘‘And they keep coming back to 
life!” I was this shocked: I had for- 
gotten to hurt. 

‘‘Friend, they sure do. And we 
have to keep persuading them not to 
move, one way or another. Other- 
wise they’d just swim away, and 
where’d we be?” 

“Waist deep in boiling blood?” 
He tried to laugh. “Well, I guess 
I’d rather boil. If they could die it’d 
be okay, but they can’t. Let ’em 
alone long enough and they try to 
get up. I can’t take it any more.” 

I felt Benito’s hand on my shoul- 
der. “Allen. The shore is clear of 
guards. I think we can move.” 
Corbett was already raising a 
wake. I started after him, tottering 
on stiffened legs. On impulse I 
turned back. “Why not come with 
us? It can’t be any worse lower 
down.” 

His eyes sparked with hope. 
“Maybe you’re right.” 



XVI 

We WADED THROUGH boiling 
blood, going up to our chins before 
the bottom sloped up again. After 
an eternity we reached the other 
shore and let ourselves fall, each 
wrapped silently and solipsistically 
in his own pain. We lay in full 
view on what seemed to be rough 
white concrete. Four targets. If the 
guardians wanted us they could 
have us. 

A long time later, Corbett found 
the strength to roll over. “They’re 
all along the far shore,” he re- 
ported. “Watching us. Nazis, 
Indians — ” 

INFERNO 



Benito said, “Never mind. They 
will not hurt us. They do not bother 
those who wish to go deeper into 
Hell.” 

“That’s a relief,” said Corbett. 

I wasn’t so sure, but I held my 
peace. I inspected my feet, legs, 
buttocks. The meat was loose on 
my bones. I should have been dead 
down there; it should have stopped 
hurting. Fat chance, Carpentier. 

And Billy, who must have hurt 
just as much as I did, was smiling 
to himself. I snarled, “What are 
you so damned happy about?’ ’ 

“First off, this is the first chance 
I’ve had to lie down in a hundred 
years. Second, I don’t have to kill 
anyone, even if they yell at me. 
Third, I didn’t much like the com- 
pany on that island. Maybe I’ll like 
you better.” 

“Maybe. Who were you?” 
“William Bonney. Just a 
cowhand that got done unto and did 
some back.” 

“Bonney?” Corbett sat up sud- 
denly. He’d healed much faster than 
I had. “Billy the Kid?” 

“Friend, there are a dozen men 
on the island that all claim they was 
Billy the Kid.” 

“And you?” 

“I’m die real one.” 

I could see the wheels going 
round in Corbett’s head. Were we 
supposed to spend eternity wonder- 
ing if he were telling the truth? 
Corbett said, “Have it your way. I 
was a spaceship pilot.” 

“What? You mean like you been 
on the Moon?” 

“Right.” 

Benito grunted and surged to his 
feet, then sat down hard with 
another grunt of pain. From the 

111 




waist down he showed bright red 
skin, very tender looking. Like 
Corbett, he’d healed fast; but he 
wasn’t in condition to scout. 

I asked, “Benito, what are we 
headed into? It’s for sure we can’t 
go back.” 

“The Wood of the Suicides lies 
ahead. A pleasant place, compara- 
tively, if we can avoid the dogs.” 

“Dogs?” 

‘ ‘The Wood is punishment for the 
sin of suicide,” Benito explained. 
“Each tree holds the soul of one 
who took his own life. They are not 
dangerous to us. But the Violent 
Wasters also suffer there, and the 
dogs are their punishment. There 
will not be many of the dog packs. 
It is almost an obsolete sin.” 

Corbett looked up. “Since when 
is a sin obsolete?” 

“Customs change. In Dante’s 
time there were men who would 
hold a party at which they would 
bum part of their wealth, to show 
how wealthy they were.” 

“Potlach!” I cried. 

“Gesundheit,” said Corbett. 

“No, dammit, listen. There was 
a west coast Indian tribe that used 
to do just what Benito’s talking about. 
Hold a party, bum a lot of val- 
uables. They used to compete at it. 
I never knew the Italians did the 
same thing.” 

“They did,” said Benito. “Their 
punishment is to run through these 
woods pursued by wild dogs. If the 
dogs catch them they tear them 
apart.” 

Billy was sitting up. “They heal 
after that?’ ’ 

I was healing! My legs and but- 
tocks still hurt, but the flesh was 
firm, and I could move the muscles. 

112 



I watched, fascinated, as new skin 
grew before my eyes. 

“The dogs and the souls they 
pursue should be rare,’’ Benito 
said, “and the trees can do us no 
harm. We should find this stretch 
easy.” He stood up. “Ready?” 

My feet were still tender, and 
Billy was complaining about his. 
But it didn’t sound like we’d have 
to run anywhere. Corbett and Be- 
nito were healed. 

We set off, deeper into Hell. It 
had become an obsession with me. 
Anything was better than wait- 
ing — and if I spent too much time 
remembering the agony in the lake, 
we’d never get started. 

We left concrete for dirt. When 
we topped a gentle rise, the ground 
was suddenly all erosion gullies, 
hard red and yellow clay studded 
with gravel and gashed by flash 
floods. We had to scramble in and 
out of them. Some had water at the 
bottom, water filthy with broken 
bottles and bottle caps, used con- 
doms, floating grease, occasional 
bursts of brightly colored dyes, 
chemicals that burned our sandalled 
feet. Nothing grew here; there were 
dead stumps of trees and dried 
brown vines reaching upward like 
dead old women’s fingers. Strange 
smells moved on the air: incongru- 
ous whiffs of automobile exhaust, 
acids, burning oil and rubber. 

Billy grunted. “I don’t see no 
trees, Benito. Where’d you put the 
damn trees?” 

“We should have reached the 
Wood long since. I do not under- 
stand. But we must go on.” 

We scrambled out of the gully 
and looked downward. We had a 
vista of Hell. 



GALAXY 




It looked like Hell on Earth. Noth- 
ing grew. We had to shout above 
a continual racket. In the distance 
rectangular shadows showed through 
the gloomy half-light and thick smog. 
Buildings? Factories? 

I said, “Progress has caught up 
with your woods, Benito.” 

A clattering sounded nearby, 
within a cloud of roiling smoke. A 
woman ran out of the smoke, terror 
on her face, hair streaming behind 
her. She wore a tom evening gown 
with diamond brooch and earrings, 
high heeled shoes with jeweled or- 
naments. She ran holding the skirt 
high. 

Billy shouted and tried to stop 
her. She dodged him and ran on. 
The clattering grew louder, and a 
bulldozer roared out of the smoke. 
A man ran just ahead of the blade. 
The ’dozer trailed smoke, and it 
was gaining on the fugitive. There 
was no driver. 

Billy was in the bottom of the 
gully, curled up, his head wrapped 
in his arms. When the monster was 
past I went down to Billy. He was 
muttering to himself, and when I 
touched him he twitched galvanical- 
ly. He leapt to his feet in fighting 
stance. 

“I was never afraid of no man 
that ever lived,” he said. “But I 
was scared of that. What was it?’ ’ 

“Bulldozer. For moving dirt.” 

Billy stared into the smog, his 
face wondering. “You could tear 
down whole mountains with things 
like that.” 

“We did,’’ Corbett said. 
“There’s more than one way to be 
a violent waster. ” 

Billy frowned. “How’s that?’’ 
he asked. 

INFERNO 



“Pollution. This must be the 
place for people who ruin the envi- 
ronment.” Corbett’s face showed 
his disgust. “They did this to the 
Earth.” 

“But who gets chased by them 
things?” 

“Real estate developers, I guess. 
Housing tract speculators. We 
shouldn’t have too much trouble 
here.” Corbett looked at us. “Or 
do we?” 

I’d always been a conservationist 
myself. If Big Juju’s poetic justice 
ran true to form, I’d be safe 
enough. 

Or would I? Had I fallen by acci- 
dent? I’d certainly put myself on 
that window ledge. If a bulldozer 
buried me here, would I become a 
tree? 

“Let’s go,” said Billy. “This 
place gives me the willies.” 

We moved off by tacit consent. 

“Where we going, anyway?” 
Billy asked. 

“Past this round there is desert,” 
Benito said. “A fiery desert, too 
hot for life, with flame falling from 
the sky. I know of only one way to 
cross it, and that was the way Dante 
used. A stream runs through the des- 
ert, the overflow from the lake of 
blood. It cools the desert as it 
moves through it.” 

“Miraculously,” I said. I’d in- 
tended it to be contemptuous, but it 
hadn’t come out that way. I’d seen 
too many miracles, all unpleasant. 

Benito nodded. “Of course. We 
must find this stream, or we cannot 
cross. It runs through the Wood. 
Comrades, we must find the 
Wood.” He turned left and walked 
on. 

“Why this way?” Billy laughed. 

113 




“You ain’t got any idea where that 
Wood is.” 

“No, but we must reach it if we 
walk far enough. It is only a matter 
of time.” 

Yeah, we had plenty of that. And 
Hell was a series of concentric cir- 
cles, God only knew how big 
around. It might take years, and so 
what? 

“Why not go the other way?” 
Billy insisted. 

Benito shrugged. “Dante always 
turned left on his way down. But 
we will turn right if you like.” 

“Naw. It ain’t important.” 

XVII 

The noise, the smells, the desola- 
tion continued. The damned were 
here, placed by a macabre humor. 
Phantom heads rose from oil pools. 
Some were pecked incessantly by 
oil-smeared birds. A river ran past 
like an open sewer, and men and 
women lined the banks, mourning. 
The wails were constant in our ears, 
wails and roaring motors and clank- 
ing machines. 

We looked into some of the huge 
buildings and pulled back out fast. 
Inside the noise was overwhelming. 
Here a sizzling hum of electricity, 
there a scream of metal grinding on 
metal, elsewhere a roar of flame. 
There were more of the damned in 
those buildings, and they were hard 
at work. 

Our way led through one of the 
immense factories. Not a head lifted 
to see us pass. Incomprehensible 
widgets passed on an endless belt, 
and men and women screwed on 
nuts and tightened them and fitted 
the bottoms and the handles, end- 

114 



lessly. We followed the endless belt 
for miles until it went through a 
wall. On the other side more of the 
damned were taking the widgets 
apart. Machinery hummed and con- 
veyors took the parts back to the 
other side of the wall. 

We left the building to find oil 
derricks raising and lowering their 
heads like prehistoric giant birds. 
We crossed a strip mine, and Benito 
pointed out that it was laid out very 
like Hell itself: a vast series of de- 
scending circular terraces. But there 
was nothing at the bottom except 
stagnant water. 

A towering oil-fueled power plant 
of spidery framework and miles of 
pipes and valves poured power into 
a cable thick as my waist. Trans- 
mission towers took the cable down- 
hill. 

I peered along its length, but the 
murk defeated me. How did they 
use electricity in Hell? But outside 
the power plant was an athletic man 
chained to a wheelless bicycle set in 
concrete in front of the exhaust pipe 
of the generator. Black smoke 
poured around him, almost hiding 
him from view. 

As we watched he began pedal- 
ling furiously. The hum of the gears 
rose to a high pitch — and the 
generator inside died. There was a 
moment of quiet. The man pedalled 
with sure strokes, faster and faster, 
his feet nearly invisible, his head 
tucked down as if against a wind. 
We gathered around, each wonder- 
ing how long he could keep it up. 

He began to tire. The blur of his 
feet slowed. The motors inside 
coughed and black smoke poured 
out. He choked and turned his head 
away and saw us. 



GALAXY 




“Don’t answer if you’d rather 
not,” I said, “but what whim of 
fate put you here?’ ’ 

“I don’t knowl” he howled. “I 
was president of the largest and 
most effective environmental protec- 
tion organization in the country! I 
fought this!” He braced himself and 
pedalled again. The hum rose and 
the generator died. 

Billy was completely lost. He 
looked to Benito, but our guide 
only shrugged. Benito accepted ev- 
erything. I knew better. This 
couldn’t be justice, not even Big 
Juju’s exaggerated justice. This was 
monstrous. 

Corbett had to be guessing when 
he suddenly asked, “You opposed 
thermonuclear power plants?” 

The guy stopped dead, staring as 
if Corbett were a ghost. The 
dynamo lurched into action and sur- 
rounded him with thick blue smoke. 

“That’s it, isn’t it?” Corbett said 
gently. “You stopped the nuclear 
generators. I was just a kid during 
the power blackouts. We had to go 
to school in the dark because the 
whole country went on daylight sav- 
ing time to save power. ’ ’ 

“But they weren’t safe!” He 
coughed. “They weren’t safe!” 
“How did you know that?” Be- 
nito asked. 

“We had scientists in our organi- 
zation. They proved it.” 

We turned away. Now I knew. I 
could quit looking for justice in 
Hell. There was only macabre 
humor. Why should that man be in 
the inner circles of Hell? At worst 
he belonged far above, with the 
bridge-destroyers of the second 
ledge. Or in Heaven. He hadn’t 
created this bleak landscape. 

INFERNO 



I couldn’t stand it. I went back. 
Benito shrugged and motioned to 
the others. 

Within the cloud of blue smoke 
his face was slack with exhaustion. 
“It wasn’t just the problem of 
where to bury the waste products,” 
he told me. “There was radioactive 
gas going into the air.” He spoke 
as if continuing a conversation. I 
must have been his only audience in 
years, or decades. 

“You got a rotten deal,” I said. 
“I wish I could do something.” 

He smiled bravely. “What else is 
new?” And he started to pedal. 

I glared at the nothing sky, hating 
Big Juju. Carpentier declares war. 
When I looked down, Benito was 
fumbling through saddlebags at- 
tached to the stationary bicycle. 

The man cried, “What are you 
doing?’ ’ 

Benito took out papers. The man 
snatched at them, but Benito backed 
away. He read, “Dear Jon, I could 
understand your opposition to us 
last year. There was some doubt 
about the process, and you expressed 
fears all of us felt. But now you 
know better. I have no witnesses, 
but you told me you understood Dr. 
Pittman’s demonstration. In God’s 
Name, Jon, why do you continue? I 
ask you as your sister, as a fellow 
scientist, as a human being: why?” 

He began pedalling again, ignor- 
ing us. 

“You knew?” I demanded. He 
pedalled faster, his head bent. I 
leaned down and put my face close 
to his. “You knew?” I screamed. 

“Fuck off.” 

Big Juju wins again. Too much, 
but appropriate. As we walked 
away, Jon screamed after us. “I’d 

115 




have been nothing if I gave up the 
movement! Nothing! Don’t you un- 
derstand? I had to stay as presi- 
dent!” 

We plunged on. Once we caught 
lungfuls of something unidentifi- 
able. We were getting used to that 
by now. This time we wound up at 
the bottom of an erosion gully, 
kicking and twitching, unable to 
control our muscles. 

“N, n, nerve g-g-gas,” said Cor- 
bett. 

We lay there for hours. Days 
perhaps. Eventually the wind 
shifted, and our legs could work 
again. Benito and Corbett scrambled 
up the side of the gully, then came 
back for Billy and me. As usual we 
were the last to heal. Big Juju’s 
biological engineers hadn’t done as 
good a job on us. We scrambled to 
the top. 

Beyond the gully we saw trees. 

That was all we could see 
through the sniffles and the tears 
and the dark, smoky air: a sharply 
bordered forest, some distance 
away. 

We began to run. Trees. Real liv- 
ing things! or close to it; nothing 
was really alive in this terrible 
place. But trees! We ran, wearing 
fierce grins, noses lifted as if the air 
were already sweet . 

Closer, they were not so inviting. 
Gnarled trunks, black leaves 
. Not Mother Nature herself 
could have called them pretty. 
Clumsy birds flapped above them. 
The forest ended abruptly at a bor- 
der of flat ground. No, not ground. 
I stopped at the edge, confused. 

The others ran heedlessly out 
onto the flat black borderland. 

116 



It was a road. Blacktop, and a 
white double line down the center. I 
called, “Hey, wait a . .” 

Things roared past and drowned 
my voice. Too fast to tell what they 
were, but I knew the sound: the 
whip of air, followed by a shriek of 
brakes. I screamed, “Run!” 

Corbett was already running for 
his life. Benito and Billy stared at 
me; then Benito just took my word 
for it and ran toward me. Billy 
looked where I was look- 
ing .. and for him it was already 
too late. 

They looked like black Corvettes, 
1970s models, but they were 
lower-slung and more rakish- 
looking. They’d stopped and turned 
and were coming back, accelerating 
hugely, leaving opaque black clouds 
of smoke. 

Billy made up his mind to run, 
he turned; and they were on him. 
Billy flew high, hit hard, and rolled 
like a bean bag: no bones. 

I started swearing. The cars 
roared away . two of them did. 
The third turned hard, right off the 
road. It rolled over once and landed 
upright and came for us, bouncing 
and rattling, but accelerating. Its 
headlights came on blindingly. 

I stopped swearing and looked for 
cover. 

“What are they?” Benito 
screamed. 

“Cars. No drivers,” Corbett told 
him. “I saw. Empty race cars. 
They must guard the forest.” 

I looked for cover: something to 
hide behind, or even a jumble of 
broken rock too rough for a car. 
Nothing. The black demon bore 
down on us. 

“There!” I pointed, and ran. It 

GALAXY 




was an oil slick, depth unknown; 
and it would bloody well have to 
do. 

I ran straight into the pool. My 
foot landed on something that 
jerked away and sent me sprawling. 
When I pulled my face out of the 
oil another black, dripping face 
looked back at me. “Sorry,” I said. 

“That’s okay. We all got our 
own problems here,” said the 
stranger; and he sank beneath the 
oil. 

Benito was waist deep and wad- 
ing deeper. Corbett hesitated at the 
edge, looked disgusted, looked be- 
hind him . squealed and dived 
sideways. I ducked under. The glare 
of headlights was branded on my 
closed eyes. 

A wave of oil splashed over me. 
I lifted my head, and there it was: a 
rakish black sports car, hubcap-deep 
in the oil pool. Its motor was a 
demon-snarl; its wheels spun franti- 
cally. It found some traction from 
somewhere: it edged backward, 
found more traction and surged out 
of the pool just as Corbett went 
over the door in a flying dive. 

The horn screamed in rage. The 
car backed, then turned in a tight 
circle. I think it was trying to roll 
over. It never made it. The motor 
died, the killer car rolled to a gentle 
stop. 

Corbett stood up in the driver’s 
seat, grinning all over his face. The 
keys dangled from his hand. 

Benito and i waded out, stream- 
ing oil. 

Corbett had the hood of the mur- 
der car up and was inspecting the 
motor. “I used to race a little,” he 
said. “I can probably drive this. 

INFERNO 



What do you say, shall we cross the 
desert in comfort?” 

“You look it over/’ I told him. 
Benito and I went to see about Bil- 
ly- 

He lay twisted as no living man 
could be. We straightened him out. 
His body was mushy and limp. So 
was one side of his head. The good 
eye opened and looked at us. 

Benito bent over Billy and took 
one of his hands between his own. 
“I don’t know if you can hear 
me,” he said. “I want you to know 
that you will heal. It will hurt, but 
you will heal.” 

I beckoned Benito out of Billy’s 
hearing. I asked, “Should we take 
him with us?” 

“I think so. He will be of no 
help until he heals, but what of 
that? He should be safe enough in 
an automobile. He can ride in the 
passenger seat.” 

We rejoined Corbett at the car. 

“I don’t know the make,” he 
told us. “It’s got a big mill, but the 
tuning is lousy. You saw how much 
smoke it was pouring out. I’ve been 
checking the brakes, and they look 
good — ” 

“The question,” said Benito, “is 
whether it will obey the steering 
wheel and other controls. We saw it 
driving itself.” 

“Yeah.” Corbett frowned, study- 
ing the car as one would search the 
face of a prisoner of war. Would he 
give information? Would it be the 
truth? “The top’s down. We can 
always jump clear,” he said. “No 
point in taking chances, though. 
Why don’t you two get under 
cover, and I’ll take her for a spin.” 

There wasn’t any cover. We 
stood at the far edge of the oil pool, 

117 




ready to jump, as Corbett turned the 
ignition key. He drove the car 
around for awhile, trying it on 
rough and smooth terrain. He 
brought it back and prudently took 
the key before he got out. 

“Seems okay. “I’ll stay in low 
gear the whole trip. That way noth- 
ing can happen fast. If the gear 
shift starts moving by itself I’ll give 
a yell.’’ 

“There’s one more problem,” I 
said. “Four of us. Two seats. Be- 
nito, shall we ride on the fenders?” 

“I have no better suggestion.” 

The change was gradual. The air 
got hotter. Then there were no more 
oil pools. The dead ground gave 
way to hot dead sand, and Corbett 
worried aloud about the tires. A 
minute later he’d forgotten the tires; 
he was too busy slapping away fat 
flakes of burning matter. _ 

xvm 

It snowed fire. Great burning 
flakes fell slowly from the dead 
gray sky and settled on us. We 
slapped frantically. Billy was 
slumped like a corpse while fire- 
flakes dropped to his skin and clung. 

I could reach his head by stretching 
backward along the fender, and I 
pulled a saucer-sized chunk from 
his face. His one good eye thanked 
me. 

We rolled across a burning sandy 
waste. The fireflakes vanished when 
they touched ground, but not when 
they touched flesh. Another evil 
miracle. The car weaved drunkenly, 
then shifted into second and picked 
up speed. 

I called back to Corbett. “Did 
you do that?” 

118 



“Yeah! You want to be out here 
forever?” 

“Not really.” The sand was flat 
enough for higher speed — provided 
we could control the car. 

Billy grunted in soft protest. I 
could imagine his fear. He’d never 
seen a car before, or gone faster 
than a horse could run. 

Fire bored into my back where 
I’d exposed it stretching to help 
Billy again. I slapped it off and 
wished for a Cadillac. 

Cadillacs belong in Hell. There’s 
something about the car that rots the 
driver’s brain. Every time some 
damn fool has almost gotten me 
wrecked by running a red light or 
jumping lanes or parking where no 
car ought to be, said idiot has been 
driving a Cadillac. There had to be 
Cadillacs in Hell — and if we’d cap- 
tured one of those, we’d be riding 
in air conditioned comfort! Instead 
of riding a fender and slapping fire- 
flakes! 

Clusters of souls danced freneti- 
cally on the blazing sand. Some 
stopped, amazed, to watch us pass. 
A couple of times Corbett tooted 
the horn at them. He was cursed for 
his trouble, but he wasn’t mocking 
them. There was nothing he could 
do. 

I called across the low hood to 
Benito. “Who are they?” 

Benito was busy tearing burning 
gunk out of his hair. “They sinned 
against Nature,” he yelled over 
his shoulder. 

“What does that mean?” 

“Unnatural love. Man for man, 
woman for woman — ” 

Man for sheep, woman for vi- 
brator . poor bastards. I wondered 
about the gay couple who’d owned 

GALAXY 




the house next door to mine. Quiet 
neighbors, friendly middle-aged 
people like any married couple 
without children. Were they here? 

I turned my head and hunched up 
so that the fireflakes hit the side of 
my face instead of the front. I 
couldn’t slap fast enough. The 
windshield gave Billy some protec- 
tion now that we were moving. 

The fire burned holes in my skin. 
You’ll heal, Carpentier. You’ll heal, 
if we ever get out of here. 

But what about them? They 
danced, they slapped at themselves; 
they ran in circles; they screamed at 
us to stop and cursed us when we 
didn’t, with an insane jealousy that 
I understood perfectly. They’d be 
here forever. 

This, just for being queer? But it 
was no surprise to me that God’s 
justice and mine didn’t agree. I 
thought about my neighbors and 
shuddered. Credo in un Dio cruel . 

The industrial section of Hell was 
only a yellow tinge to the sky be- 
hind us. Ahead was nothing but 
more desert. We must be about 
halfway across, I thought. 

Suddenly the car surged forward 
with the bit in its teeth. 

Corbett froze in panic. The motor 
screamed in inhuman fury as the car 
accelerated. In a second we’d be 
moving too fast to stop. I tucked 
my head in my aims and rolled off 
the fender. 

Look, I wasn’t running out on 
my buddies. The car was going to 
crash, and they’d have a better 
chance if one of us could move, 
right? It was what I was thinking, 
anyway. 

The motor choked off while I 
was still in the air. 

INFERNO 



I hit rolling. I came up screaming 
and dancing. The other souls hadn’t 
been dancing for joy either. The 
pain was as bad as the boiling 
blood. 

The car rolled to a stop, and I ran 
for it, yelling and swearing at the 
fireflakes. 

Suddenly a girl was running 
alongside me. She’d have been 
pretty once. Now her hair was 
raggedly scorched, and her body 
was covered with bums. “Can you 
take me out of here?’’ she 
screamed. 

“We’ll be lucky to get out our- 
selves. There’s no room!” I kept run- 
ning until I reached the car. 

The girl stayed right with me. 
“Please, I’ll do anything if you’ll 
take me out of here. Anything. 

“That’s nice,” Corbett told her. 
To me he said, “We’re in big trou- 
ble. The gas pedal just floored it- 
self. I had to turn off the ignition. 

“Couldn’t you — ” 

“Couldn’t I what? Pull the pedal 
up with my toes? Allen, this car is 
haunted. It hates us.” 

“What’s wrong?” the girl asked. 
She got no answer. 

It was hard to think with the fire 
settling on me. I danced around the 
car, shouting, “We’d better think of 
something. In a minute or two we’ll 
be under a pyramid of people.” The 
damned were running toward us 
from all directions. 

“Raise the bonnet,” Benito 
commanded. “Corbett, see to Bil- 
ly-” 

I got the hood up. We looked in- 
side, and Benito said, “Now, Cor- 
bett, move the accelerator. ’ ’ 

Something wiggled behind the 
engine. 

119 




“Allen, you saw? That moved 
the petrol feed. You must control it 
with your fingers.” 

It was a hell of an awkward posi- 
tion, sprawled across the fender 
with my head and hands under the 
hood. The motor was as hot as the 
sand. I couldn’t avoid touching it. 
But I pulled at the widget and cried, 
“Okay! I got it! Corbett, go! Go 
like a bat!” The crowd was very 
near, and they couldn’t all hang on. 
Benito motioned to the girl and she 
took the fender in front of me. 

The car roared and surged into a 
converging circle. Most of them 
dodged for their lives. One went 
under the wheels. Another, a big 
athletic type with long black hair 
halfway down his back and a 
scraggly beard, got the edge of the 
right door and swung up on the 
trunk lid. A small-boned blond man 
had come with him. “Frank!” the 
companion called. “Frank! Don’t 
leave me!” 

“Sony, Gene. Nothing I can do. 
No room for both of us.” 

“Frank!” The car gunned ahead 
as Corbett got it under control 
.again. A thin voice followed us. 
“Frank! I went to Hell for 
you . .” 

Frank had managed to crawl up 
to get an arm around Corbett’s 
neck. He squeezed. “All right, 
buddy, turn this thing around! 
We’re going to Havana!” 

“Fine. Whatever you say,” said 
Corbett. Frank grinned and slacked 
off his grip on Corbett, but he 
didn’t let go. 

Now we had: Frank on the trunk; 
Billy in the passenger seat, groaning 
a little, still unable to move; Benito 
on the left front fender; me in the 

120 



motor compartment trying to stay 
clear of the hot engine, my legs 
dangling out to the right; and the 
girl forward on the right front fen- 
der, her feet on the bumper. Corbett 
had his problems driving. He had to 
lean way out to the left to see 
around the open hood. 

Billy was able to scream now. 

“For God’s sake, brush the fire 
off him, Frank!” Corbett yelled. 

“Screw that. Screw God too. Get 
moving.” 

We moved. Corbett yelled, and I 
slacked off on the gas to let him 
shift to second. That was fast 
enough. The car fought, the hot 
metal tugged against my fingers like 
something alive, but I could control 
the speed. At least we weren’t hit- 
ting any bumps. 

“HeeeHaaah!” Frank screamed 
in joy. “Better’n the last chicken 
run! I’ll make you guys honorary 
Hell’s Angels! We’re tough, you 
know? Toughest bunch in the 
world, you know? Hick sheriff was 
so scared of us he called the State 
Fuzz. We run for it. I had the lead. 
Come around a curve and the whole 
road was full of Fuzzmobiles. I got 
two fuzz smearing myself.” 

“Your friend back there — ” I 
shouted. 

“Gene? We did some swinging 
times, man. Had a whole stable of 
’em. Boys, girls, but the only one 
they let me keep here was Gene. 
Maybe I’ll miss him.” He didn’t 
look back. 

“Could you get that fire off my 
leg?” I asked the girl. 

“Naw! Enough trouble holding 
on here.” 

“You said you’d do anything!” I 
clenched my teeth in agony. There 

GALAXY 




was fire on both legs now, and I 
couldn’t slap. I couldn’t let go of 
the spring, and I had to hold on 
with the other hand. The car was 
still fighting me. “Get that fire off 
or we’ll throw you off!” 

‘‘Awright, awright, you don’t 
have to get nasty.” She slapped a 
couple of times and got the worst 
away. 

“Who are you?” Benito asked. 

“Doreen Lancer,” she yelled 
above the roaring motor. “Go-go 
dancer. One night some bastard 
raped me and strangled me. At 
least, he tried to rape me!” She 
laughed bitterly. “He didn’t seem 
to know how to go about it!” 

“So what the hell are you doing 
here?” Frank demanded. 

“Don’t know! I liked it every 
which way. Most of the types I 
meet here are fags — ” 

“I’m no goddam fag!” Frank 
yelled. 

“Do not blaspheme,” Benito told 
him, predictably, I guess. 

“Fuck off! Talk to me that way 
and I’ll twist this bastard’s neck 
off!” The car lurched as he choked 
Corbett. 

“No!” Doreen screamed. “We’ll 
crash! This is our only way out! 
Leave him alone — Look, don’t hurt 
him, and when we get out we can 
really swing, right?” 

1 laughed. I couldn’t help it. 

“What’s so funny?” she de- 
manded. 

“It’s not a romantic situation!” I 
bellowed. I wasn’t even sure there 
could be sex in Hell, and I hadn’t 
found any opportunity to try. Or in- 
clination, either. 

I bellowed again when she slapped 
my testicles. It hurt as much as it 

INFERNO 



had when I was alive. I pulled the 
accelerator widget out, tugging with 
all my strength, letting the car slow. 

“I’m sorry!” she yelled. “I was 
getting the fire off, I swear, that’s 
all I was doing! I’m sorry . hey, 
you wanna be a threesome with 
Frank and me?” 

I let the car speed up again. We 
had to get out of here. But I’d 
never had an offer I liked less. 

“I can see something ahead!” 
Corbett shouted. “We’re getting to 
the edge!” 

“About time,” Frank said. We 
rolled on. “Just remember, pretty 
boy, I’m in charge here,” he add- 
ed, and Corbett grunted in pain. 
Frank must have emphasized his 
words. 

The horizon was sharp ahead. I 
could barely see over the motor. 
Corbett saw it too. “Kill the pow- 
er!” he yelled. Brakes screeched, 
and he twisted the wheel hard. 

I climbed out of the motor. The 
fireflakes were thicker here than in 
the middle of the desert. We ran, 
hopping — 

Frank still had Corbett by the 
neck. “This the way out of here? 
What are you trying to pull?” 

There was a sheer drop ahead of 
us. It was gloomy down there. I 
couldn’t see the bottom. Several 
hundred feet, anyway. “Now 
what?’ ’ I asked Benito. 

“The quick way would be to 
jump.” He was dead serious. 
“Jump and wait to heal, then go 
on.” 

The girl backed away, staring at 
him. “You’re crazy! Crazy! I 
should have known better than to 
trust guys like you! All the prom- 
ises you make — ” She didn’t finish, 

121 




but ran back into the desert, crying. 

“That’s done it!” Frank yelled. 
“You’re sure as Hell going over 
that cliff, all right, because I’m go- 
ing to throw you!” He had Corbett 
by the neck and he dragged him 
toward the cliff edge. “First you, 
then your loudmouth friend, then 
the fat one, and then — ” 

He’d forgotten Billy. We all had. 
It was a mistake for Frank. Billy 
launched himself from the car with- 
out warning. He landed on Frank’s 
back and seized the long hair with 
one hand, pulled the head back, and 
wrapped his arm around Frank’s 
neck. His knee gouged into the 
Hell’s Angel’s back, bowing him 
into an arc. “Friend, I don’t think I 
like you.” 

I yelled, “Billy! Are you all 
right?” 

“Yeah.” 

“You weren’t moving — ” 

“Been able to move a while 
now. Didn’t seem like a good idea 
to let this creep know it. Jerry 
coulda crashed this thing if we were 
fightin’ while it was movin’.” 

I thought about the self-control it 
would take to sit still under a rain 
of sticky fire. 

“What’ll I do with the Gila 
monster, Benito?” 

“Leggo! I was only kidding!” 
Frank yelled. “You guys got no 
business giving me false hopes! It 
was all your fault — ” He stopped 
talking because Billy’s arm had 
closed his throat. 

“Do not harm him,” Benito said 
quietly. 

“Yeah?” Billy let him go. 
“Friend, you’re not tough. You 
don’t know what tough is. Now get 
away from us.” The pale blue eyes 

122 



seemed infinitely deep, and cold 
even in this place of fire. 

“You may come with us if you 
like,” Benito told Frank, “although 
I do not think you are ready. With 
your attitude you might well find a 
worse place than you have now. 
Still, you are welcome to join us.” 

“Go to Hell!” Frank screamed. 
He thought that was funny. “Go to 
Hell! Go to Hell!” He ran away 
into the desert, laughing, scream- 
ing, trying to keep both feet off the 
hot sand at once. 

Benito looked at us, waiting. 

“I’ll jump if you say so,” Billy 
said. “Looks bad, though. I can tell 
you, being crushed flat ain’t no 
fun.” 

I gulped. “I will too.” I won- 
dered if I meant it. 

“There may be a better way,” 
Benito said, “We must find the 
stream. Corbett, can you drive?” 

“Sure.” 

We turned left. I had the whole 
fender to sprawl on now. The car 
seemed more docile, too, but I 
wasn’t going to trust it. I didn’t re- 
ally have to — I was getting good at 
manipulating the gas widget. 

We came to a horde of people 
dressed in the finery of all ages: 
velvet robes, flare pants, alligator 
shoes. Corbett shouted at me. 
“Stopping!” He turned off the key 
before I could do anything, and the 
car rolled to a halt. 

Fireflakes fell on us. “Now 
what?’ ’ 

Corbett was out of the car and 
looking at a beefy man in gaudy 
tunic, crimson sash, and black 
glove leather boots. There was a big 
leather wallet hung on a golden 
chain around his neck, and he 

GALAXY 




stared into it, not looking up. The 
fireflakes had burned holes in his 
tunic and scorched his hair. 

Corbett stood in front of him. 
When the burly man didn’t look 
up, Corbett stooped over so that his 
face was in line with the wallet. 
“Give me my money!” Corbett 
shouted. 

“You son of a bitch, you owe 
me\" 

“But I’ve had this problem, see, 
my girl is . .” Corbett began. 

“I don’t want to hear any stories, 
I just want my money! Arrgh!” A 
big fireflake settled on the crown of 
his head. He tried to brush it off. 

“Hang tough,” Corbett said. 
He came back to the car chuck- 
ling. “Long Harry there loaned me 
some cash, once. Six for five — 
every week.” 

I nodded. There were lots of 
others there, crying into their 
purses. The rain of fire seemed 
heavier here. “Let’s get going.” I 
didn’t like Corbett gloating over 
them — but if anybody deserved to 
be here, it was them. Loan shark is 
as low a form of life as there is. 

We didn’t drive so fast that we 
couldn’t talk. “Funny thing about 
Harry,” Corbett said. “He had to 
give up the loan shark business. 
Had a customer with a hit man for a 
friend. Took his buddy Lem to see 
Harry, but Harry wouldn’t listen. 
Just kep saying ‘Give me my 
money. “So Lem had a talk with 
Harry.” 

“Lem?” Billy asked. He sounded 
puzzled. 

“Yeah. I don’t know what he 
told Harry, but just after that all of 
Harry’s customers were off the 
hook. Just had to pay what they’d 

INFERNO 



got in the first place.” 

“Lem,” Billy said. “Little guy? 
About my size? Big scar over his 
left eye?” 

“Yeah,” Corbett said. “You 
know him?” 

“Kind of. They used to let him 
onto the island for a day. One day a 
year. The rest of the time he was 
out in the blood. I always did won- 
der why.” 

“We are coming to the stream,” 
Benito said. “The fire does not fall 
there. ’ ’ 



XIX 

The river was narrow but fast. Its 
roar was different somehow from 
that of water, and it was still bright 
scarlet. The air was thick with the 
smell of blood. 

Nonetheless we walked down and 
bathed our half-broiled feet in it. 
Afterward we walked the cool mud 
of the bank with our sandals off un- 
til we reached the waterfall. There 
we watched endless tons of blood 
falling into the darkness. 

I said, “Now what?” 

Benito scowled in indecision. “It 
is a risk. The monster Geryon car- 
ried Dante and Virgil into lower 
Hell. But they were on a holy er- 
rand. We are not. I have known 
Geryon. He is not worthy of trust.” 
“The password,” I remembered. 

“ ‘This has been willed where 
what is willed must be.’ Yes. Shall 
we try it?” 

“Better’n jumping” Billy looked 
at Benito, “ft is, ain’t it? What can 
he do to us? Eat us?” 

“Summon Minos.” 

“Let’s try it,” said Corbett. 

123 




“We’ve gotten this far without any- 
one doing that.’’ 

“Are we agreed, then? Good. 
Now we must summon Geryon. We 
need a signal, something to get his 
attention. Dante flung a rope into 
the abyss.” 

“A signal,” said Corbett. “Does 
it have to be subtle?’ ’ 

“I should not think that subtlety 
would be necessary.” 

“We wouldn’t want Geryon to 
think we’re crude, would we? Some 
delicate change in the environment, 
just noticeable enough to attract his 
attention. Let me see.” Corbet 
walked back to the car and switched 
on the ignition. He went around to 
the back and unscrewed the gas 
cap. 

A fireflake fell past his nose. He 
blew on it, guiding it into the gas 
tank. The tank lit with a Whoosh. 
Hurriedly Corbett reached into the 
car and shifted it into first gear. We 
stood well back and watched it roll 
over the edge. 

“Subtlety is all,” said Corbett. 

The car fell like a battlefield 
flare. It passed and illuminated a 
compact body already rising through 
the murk. 

“He knew we were here.” Cor- 
bett was flat on his belly with his 
face over the cliff’s edge. “We 
didn’t need a signal.” 

“He will not come without a sig- 
nal,” said Benito. 

The car was a towering flame at 
the base of the cliff. Lighted from 
below, Geryon was a compact 
shadow with a slender, twisting tail. 
He floated up to us, his features 
growing clear. He hovered at our 
height, smiled reassuringly at us 
with a startlingly human face; then 

124 



slid forward onto the rock ledge, 
leaving his tail hanging free in 
space. 

Geryon was as big as a rowboat, 
and wingless. His hind feet were 
webbed, built for swimming. His 
almost human head was hairless, 
the mouth wide, the chin broad and 
strong, the nose very wide and flat, 
with large nostrils. The head sloped 
back to round shoulders, without 
benefit of neck. 

His arms were human enough, 
the size of my own. On Geryon 
they were disproportionately small. 
Something was funny about the 
hands; the fingers were short and 
thick, designed for ripping. 

I could see him as an air- 
breathing aquatic beast that had de- 
veloped human intelligence. I won- 
dered about his nose. It was big 
enough to feed him air fast, hooded 
to keepwater out. Reasonable, but 
different from the cetacean design. 

His pelt had the look of medieval 
tapestry: golden knots and figures 
on a blue-grey background. Lovely; 
a trifle flashy. And adequate 
camouflage if he was used to hover- 
ing just beneath sunlit water. 

Altogether he was a believable 
alien, excluding his ability tri fly. I 
didn’t like that. Bad enough if In- 
fernoland had been built by hu- 
mans. What if it had been built by 
interstellar conquerors for their own 
amusement? 

Geryon’s voice was deep, with a 
queer buzzing quality. “Hello, Be- 
nito. Three of them? Isn’t that a bit 
much?” 

Benito was brusk. He didn’t like 
Geryon. “This has been willed 
where what is willed must be. In 
any case, you must have noticed 

GALAXY 





how the damned flow in like a river 
in flood — ” 

“Haven’t I just. Swamping you, 
are they? I think the end of the 
world must be near. Hell is getting 
full,” said the alien. “Well, we who 
serve God’s will in Hell have pre- 
cious little of free will, eh, Benito? 
Climb aboard, you. I hope you can 
all hang on.” 

He had spoken jovially, with no 
bitterness and only the merest trace 
of mockery. 

My foot kicked something rigid 
as I tried to board Geryon’s reason- 
ably flat back. I looked down. It 
wasn’t easy to see, but there was 
metal belted about Geryon’s belly, 
machinery covered with material the 
same color as his gaudy pelt. 

Antigravity? 

I settled behind the monster’s 

INFERNO 



head. Billy’s arms closed about my 
waist. Corbett was behind him, and 
Benito last, braving the twin stings 
in the forked tail. Geryon grinned at 
me over his shoulder and pushed 
back from the edge. 

Billy’s arms tightened convulsive- 
ly. I saw that his eyes were closed 
tight, his teeth clenched. 

My view of Hell was darkness 
and firelit smokes, the fires tracing 
concentric arcs. Geryon tilted to one 
side and dropped in a slow spiral. 



The scarlet waterfall dashed itself to 
foam and spray on the rocks. Billy 
was squeezing the breath from me, 
but I didn’t complain. I heard 
whimpering noises being squeezed 
from him. 

We touched down. 

I said, “Your first flight, Billy?” 

“Yeah.” 

“We’re down. You can let go.” 

“Yeah.” He unlocked his arms 
in stages and climbed down on 
shaky legs. I followed. 

Geryon floated up a few feet and 
hovered. “Hey, Benito,” he called. 
His voice was full of artificial 
cameraderie, more menacing than 
threats. “Why is it, Benito, that the 
people you travel with don’t ever 
come back?” The monster lifted 
toward the sky, chortling. 

Carefully casual, Corbett asked 
Benito, “You’ve been here be- 
fore?” 

“I have rescued others,” Benito 
answered. 

“How many?” 

“Six. One at a time. No matter 
how many come with me at first, 
no more than one at a time ever 
seems to reach the exit point. 
Perhaps this time we will be more 
fortunate.” 

“What happens to the others?” I 
asked. 

“Why did you come back?” 
Corbett demanded. 

We’d both spoken at once, and 
Benito chose to answer neither of 
us. 

“Have you seen the exit?” Cor- 
bett asked. 

Benito’s voice was colorlessly 
grim. “Yes.” 

“And gone beyond it?” 

“No. But it follows Dante’s 

126 



route, which leads to Purgatory. I 
came back to find others in need of 
guidance. Do you object, Allen 
Carpentier? Should I have left you 
in the bottle?” 

“Hey, hey, hey!” Billy was 
dancing with impatience. “If we’re 
going, let’s gol What’s all the jaw- 
ing about?” 

Benito nodded and led us off 
downslope. We felt exposed on 
level ground, and Geryon couldn’t 
be the only flying thing. He hadn’t 
reported us (had he?) but that was 
no guarantee that something else 
wouldn’t. We moved swiftly across 
what seemed to be solid rock, al- 
ways downhill, further into murk 
and gloom, until we came to a cliff 
edge. 

There was a ditch in front of us, 
seventy or eighty feet deep and 
p’erhaps twice that wide. It was di- 
vided in the middle by a low wall 
of rock. Just off to our left was a 
passageway in the dividing rock 
wall. The divider was low enough 
that we could see over it, lower 
than the height of a normal man — 

— and the ditch was full. Masses 
of humanity moved in a standard 
traffic pattern, all hurrying along, 
not quite running, leftbound on the 
far side, rightward on the near side. 
They moved fast. 

They moved fast because there 
were beings with whips urging them 
along. It took a moment for that to 
register. 

Okay, Carpentier, you’re in Hell 
and there are demons in Hell. There 
were things on the red-hot wall that 
might have been demons if you 
could have seen them clearly 
through the fog. There’s Geryon, 
certainly a monster. Of course 

GALAXY 




Big Juju can make demons. 

But I hadn’t wanted to believe it. 
Now I was looking at them. They 
were blackskinned rather than the 
red I’d expected, and they were at 
least ten feet tall. They had horns 
and tails and were uglier than I 
could have imagined. They used 
whips twice as long as themselves. 
They screamed at the laggards: 
“Along with you, Big Morris, 
there’s no ass to sell here!” 

“Git along, little dogie, git 
along,' git along ...” 

Wails and groans rose from the 
pit, and screams of pain and rage. 
Snap! Crack! Chunks of flesh flew 
from the backs of those who slowed 
down. 

“Who,” whispered Corbett. He 
ran out of voice and had to try 
again. “Who are they?” He was 
frightened, and why not? I was 
scared out of my mind. The demons 
were looking up at us — 

— but they went back to their 
tasks, gleefully lashing the crowd. I 
recognized one of the runners. He 
was a famous movie director- 
producer, idolized by millions when 
I was younger. He was on the near 
side, but as he reached the pas- 
sageway in the dividing wall the 
demon stationed there lashed him 
until he went through and joined 
those scurrying in the other direction. 

I’d never met him, but I knew 
who he was. And I knew who these 
people must be. 

Benito confirmed my suspicions. 
“Panderers on this side, seducers 
on the other. Come, we must find a 
bridge.” He turned left and we fol- 
lowed uncertainly. 

“I . was a seducer,” Corbett 
said uncertainly. 

INFERNO 



I remembered the convention at- 
mosphere and what happened the 
night before I died. “Me too.” 
Benito snorted. “Did you ever 
have a woman against her will?” 
“No—” 

‘ ‘Or make her drunk, or drug her?’ ’ 
“Well—” Did pot count? “No- 
body who didn’t know what to ex- 
pect.” 

“Never had to,” Corbett said 
matter-of-factly. 

“Or use threats of force?” 
“Don’t be silly.” Corbett re- 
sented the implication. “I told you, 
it wasn’t necessary.” 

“The Italian does not properly 
translate as your English seducer, 
which is hardly more than casual 
fornication,” Benito said seriously. 
“I think perhaps the better word is 
‘rape’.” 

Now we could see the bridge 
ahead of us: a stone arch. It looked 
very old. 

“Jerry!” A voice called from the 
pit. “Jerry! Come on down, Jerry. 
You belong here!” 

It stopped Corbett cold. He 
looked down into the pit. “Julia?” 
“Come on down, Jerry. “Share 
everything with me. You taught me 
how, Jerry — ” 

“How can a girl be a rapist?” I 
demanded. She was, or had been, 
quite pretty, but now her face was 
distorted in pain and exhaustion. 
The demons were watching her 
stand there as she panted and 
shouted up to Corbett, and they 
didn’t interfere. 

“Deceit. Fraud,” said Benito. 
“Those who induce others to what 
they know is wrong, as well as those 
who force their will on others.” 

I turned to Corbett and Shut up, 

127 




Carpentier! None of your business 
closed my mouth. 

“You taught me everything, Jer- 
ry,” she was calling. “I could still 
love you. Come down with me. 
Where else can you go now?” 

“Out! Down to the center and 
out!” Corbett screamed to her. 

The demons howled maniac 
laughter. The girl laughed with 
them. “Oh, Jerry, do you believe 
that? Don’t you know that the 
deeper you go, the worse it is, and 
you can’t ever go back, and you 
can’t get out? It’s worse down 
there, Jerry. Wait till you see who’s 
below us! Here you have me , Jerry. 
Stay where you belong. There’s no 
escape down there. Don’t you know 
what’s carved on the gates of Hell, 
Jerry? All hope abandon!” 

“I’m not afraid of what’s be- 
low!” Corbett was getting hysteri- 
cal. “I never did any of the things 
they punish you down there for — ” 
She laughed again. “The only 
perfect man who ever lived! Are 
you sure, Jerry? Then why do they 
let you GO there? And what makes 
you think you’ll get justice anyway? 
Come down with me before its too 
late to HYEEEE!” 

The demons had called time on 
her. Crack! Snap! The whips 
sounded like popcorn popping. Julia 
sprinted, screaming with the rest. 
The flesh of my back rippled. I 
wanted to shut my ears. 

“Come.” Benito took Corbett’s 
arm. “Come. Do not let her seduce 
you again.” 

“Uh?” Corbett looked at Benito 
as if he’d only just met him. “It did 
happen that way, now you mention 
it. Or did it? Maybe I do belong in 
that pit." 

128 



“If you do, you will be there. 
For the moment you are not, 
ergo — come along.” 

We walked in silence, each 
wrapped in his own thoughts, What 
if the girl were right? Were we 
plunging deeper and deeper, never 
to return? What was below us? Had 
I committed any of the appropriate 
crimes? “Benito, what’s ahead?” 

His dry lecture voice couldn’t 
mask the screaming as we walked 
the rim. “No more!” “Not again!” 
“Wait, I’m in the wrong place!” 
“It was just one book, just one, I 
needed the money l” “You big ugly 
sonofabitch, you — ” Crack! 

“Of the ten Bolgias — canyons — 
of this circle of Hell, this is the 
only divided one. Each canyon is 
crossed by a bridge, except that all 
the bridges are down across the 
sixth canyon. We must descend into 
it. It will be no problem.” 

“Benito, how in God’s name can 
you ignore those screams?” Corbett 
demanded. 

“They have no more than they 
deserve,” Benito said simply. 
Either he hadn’t the empathy of a 
turtle, or ... or what? “Now, we 
will have trouble at the fifth Bolgia. 
It is the pit of grafters, and the de- 
mons are on the rim, not down in 
the canyon.” 

“Ugh.” I’d forgotten most of the 
Inferno, but I could never have for- 
gotten that image: a troop, an army, 
of devils, ill-mannered and sadistic, 
a military organization of ugly hate. 
They’d almost got Dante despite his 
safe-conduct. “What’s after this 
circle?” 

We had reached an arching 
bridge of rough stone. It had no 
handrails and was about ten feet 



GALAXY 




wide, a slender arch above that pit 
of screaming runners. It sloped up 
so steeply that I dropped to all fours 
to climb. 

“Jerry! Come down, Jerry!” It 
was the girl again. Corbett stif- 
fened. 

“What’s next?” I prompted Be- 
nito. “After the ten canyons what 
will we find?” 

“Very little,” Benito answered. 
“The great ice plain, where traitors 
are punished. Those who betrayed 
their blood kin or their benefactors. ” 

“Not me,” Corbett said. He 
seemed to feel better. “And then?” 

“We cross to the very center. 
There is a hole. We crawl through 
it, past the center of the world, and 
find ourselves climbing up again.” 

“And I can believe as much of 
that as I like?’ ’ 

“Certainly. Why should you not 
believe it?” Benito was genuinely 
puzzled. 

“It’s nonsense,” said Corbett. 
“We’d be in free fall by the time 
we got there.” 

‘ 'Jerry!’ ’ 

Corbett shuddered. The voice 
floated upward again. “Don’t be a 
fool, Jerry. It’s bad down there at 
the center. And they never let you 
out.” 

“Did I really put her there?” 
Corbett wondered. “Maybe I have 
betrayed a benefactor. She was kind 
to me and — ” 

“Come on, no woman’s worth 
what they’re gettin’,” Billy said. 
“We stick together. I never let a 
buddy down in my life, and I’m 
goin’ down to the center. Now 
come on.” 

Corbett lost some of his tension. 
“If you’re really Billy the Kid,

that’s right. At least, that’s what the 
movies showed.” He began moving 
again, over the arch of the bridge, 
and downward. “Benito, your de- 
scription is still nonsense. Not only 
would there be free fall at the center 
of the Earth, but this isn’t Earth to 
begin with. A cavity this size, un- 
der the Earth? Can you imagine the 
pressures ? And we’d get seismo- 
graph readings on it with every earth- 
quake. No, we have to be some- 
where else.” 

“Sure,” I said. “Infernoland. 
Somebody built it, following Dante. 
But the geography’s been the same 
as the Inferno all the way so far, so 
what do we care if it’s an artifact?” 
“It is an artifact,” Benito said, 
“in the sense that God designed and 
built it.” 

“Okay,” said Corbett. “I was 
never a good atheist. Not a church- 
man either. Still, Benito, I’ve 
seen designs for bigger structures 
than this. Bigger than Earth, for 
that matter. Our real problem is, did 
Dante really see this place himself? 
And can we trust his reports?” 

That was a good question, but I 

129 





had a better one. How far could we 
trust Benito? He had never men- 
tioned earlier trips. 

Just how did Benito get back up- 
hill after those trips? How did he 
earn this privelege of running free 
through Hell? Geryon had said ‘we’ 
when speaking of both himself and 
Benito. ‘We who serve God in 
Hell.’ 

Benito was an unlikely angel 
. and Geryon an untrust- 
worthy witness, I reminded myself. 
But this was the Devil’s realm, and 
Benito wandered at whim. 

All right, Carpentier: just what is 
the punishment for a soul who de- 
fies God’s final command? God or 
Big Juju, I had plenty of evidence 
that He was vindictive. He put me 
in the Vestibule, and I violated my 
sentence. Minos warned me. Is this 
the final retribution against Caipen- 
tier? To go even deeper into Hell, 
with no way back, to find my own 
level and have it worse than He 
condemned me to? 

Or. Suppose this really is Infemo- 
land, a bigger and more powerful 
Builder’s playground. Why would 
the Geryon-type engineers have 
built anything but the Inferno? They 
clearly enjoyed seeing humans suf- 
fer. Would they get a similar kick 
from human pleasure? All the pro- 
fessors told me the Inferno was by 
far the most interesting of the three 
books of the Divine Comedy. 

Benito was talking again. “I have 
always assumed that Dante made 
his trek in a vision. When he woke 
he had forgotten many of the de- 
tails. He filled them in with re- 
search in theology and dogma and 
philosophy and natural histopr and 
with his own whims and prejudices 

130 



and special hatreds. But the basic 
vision was sound and true. Be care- 
ful here.” 

The bridge dropped steeply at the 
end. The inner rim of the trench 
was twenty feet lower than the out- 
er. We went down backward. The 
lip of another pit was a hundred 
yards away. A cacaphony of sound 
rose from it. We stopped for a mo- 
ment. 

“For instance,’’ Benito said, 
‘‘Dante’s work gives the impression 
that he met large numbers of 
Italians — ’ ’ 

“Sounds perfectly reasonable to 
me,” said Corbett. We tried to 
laugh, but this wasn’t a place for 
laughing. 

Benito merely continued as if he 
hadn’t heard. “Improbable numbers 
of Italians. Large numbers of fa- 
mous ancients. He met writers, poets, 
politicians, but no Hottentots, Es- 
quimaux, Askaris, or American In- 
dians. This seems unlikely.” 

“Then you don’t trust Dante after 
all?” 

“Jerry, that was not my point.” 

I said, “Benito, we’ve met an 
embarrassing sufficiency of Ameri- 
cans.” 

Billy laughed. “Plenty on the .is- 
land, too.” 

Benito was startled. “It is true. 
And Hilda Kroft and I met Ger- 
mans. And — ” ' 

“Man tends to notice his own 
folks,” said Billy. “Let’s get mov- 
ing. 

We angled toward a bridge span- 
ning the next ditch. Benito still 
looked disturbed. Why? That dis- 
turbed me. 

The smell stopped us joltingly at 
the second pit. It was like being 

GALAXY 




dropped into a sewer. We didn’t 
even try to look over the edge. 

“Who’s down there?” Billy 
asked. 

“Flatterers,” Benito said shortly, 
and turned toward the bridge. 

We followed. “I don’t get it,” 
Corbett said. 

“In every place of power, 
throughout all time, the rulers have 
been surrounded by flatterers. In 
many places flattery has been the 
path to power and wealth. In others 
it is only a good living. Yet 
everywhere the flatterers tend to 
push aside the men of real wisdom. 
Flattery is so much safer than tell- 
ing unpleasant truths.” 

“Not in America,” said Corbett. 

“This I doubt,” said Benito. 
“But then I suppose that you would 
know best.” 

“Never buttered up the boss? I 
sure have,” said Billy. 

I felt uncomfortable. What was I 
doing at the moment I died but flat- 
tering the fans? I glanced over at 
Corbett and he looked no better. 
Flattery? We’d all tried it. What did 
they do to flatterers? 

We clustered at the bridge ap- 
proach and stood looking at it. The 
smell was thick as putty. I could 
feel it clinging to me and I 
squirmed. Corbett said, “How are 
we going to cross that?” 

“Fast,” I said. “Don’t breathe.” 
I didn’t move. 1 hadn’t worked up 
the nerve. 

“Come on, pals!” Billy hit the 
bridge at a dead run. As he went 
over the arch and disappeared from 
view, we heard him yell. The other 
side of the bridge would be steep. I 
hoped he’d rolled to the end and not 
over the edge. I wasn’t ready to 



dive in after him, and I didn’t hear 
anyone else volunteer. 

“Billy?” I shouted. No answer. 

“He’s all right,” Corbett said. 
His voice was hollowly reassuring. 
“Sure he is.” 

We looked at each other. We 
took deep breaths. We scrambled up 
the arch, and when we could stand, 
we ran. 

Was Billy down there? I made 
the mistake of looking from the top 
of the arch. 

Down into a river of shit, chest- 
deep. A respectable crowd waded 
through it. 

Disgust can freeze you as solid as 
fear. At my side, Corbett stopped to 
look where I was looking. He made 
a retching sound, took my arm and 
tried to pull me on. I couldn’t 
move. I’d recognized someone I 
knew. 

I called down. “George!” 

Heads turned up. They were dis- 
guised by what was smeared across 
the faces, but that was George, all 
right. I tried to remember his last 
name, and couldn’t. 

But he knew me. He shrank away 
with his sticky arms hiding his 
sticky head. 

Benito had come back up the 
bridge. “Billy is safe.” He spoke 
with the pinched voice of a man 
holding his breath. “Who was 
that?” 

“An old friend. An advertising 
man, wrote fiction in his spare 
time. Not very good stories, but he 
wasn’t a bad guy. How did he get 
here?” 

“Immoderate flattery. There is no 
other way to reach this pit. Allen, 
Jerome. No profit in standing here; 
you cannot enjoy the view.” 



131 




Immoderate flattery? It fit, in a 
way. In Big Juju’s way. Most ad- 
vertising is immoderate praise of a 
product or its users. But like every 
other torture I’d seen in Hell, it was 
just too damned much! I wanted to 
tell George . what? That he’d 
been wronged? That I’d get justice 
for him no matter what it took? 
That I couldn’t save him and I 
couldn’t save myself and everything 
was useless because we were in the 
hands either of a cruel God or heart- 
less aliens? I don’t know. But I’d 
remembered one of his own ads, 
and I shouted it down to him. It 
was not to mock him! Only to get 
his attention! 

“You deserve to belong to the 
Xanadu Country Club!” 

The response was an explosion 
of voices. Smeared stinking 
heads rose, mocking voices called. 
“The wethead is dead!” “Aren’t you 
glad you use Dial? Don’t you 
wish everybody did?” “I’m Glenda! 
Fly me!” “Hazel, it turned 
bluel” “Always have . always 
will!” 

And we three who peered into the 
moat, we saw where the shit came 
from. 

Another macabre joke. Every one 
of them had been fitted with a sec- 
ond anus. It became apparent only 
when they tried to speak. 

Corbett bent double, heaving, a 
ghost trying to expel emptiness 
from the ghost of his belly. I tried 
to help him, but he backed away 
fast. He didn’t want to be touched. 
The convulsions went on and on. 

I tried to turn away from the 
edge, but it was too late. George 
screamed up at me, in agony. “Al- 
len! Why?” 

132 



“I’m sony!” I should have left 
him alone. 

Benito spoke in an actor’s voice, 
calm but carrying. “There is a way 
out of Hell.” 

He got insults and laughter, but a 
few listened. 

“You must climb the pit. Coop- 
erate if you must. It will be hard, 
but you can do it if you try long 
enough. Then you must move in- 
ward. The route to Heaven is at the 
center of Hell.” 

Smeared faces turned away. 
George stayed to answer. His laugh 
had tears in it. “Me, in Heaven? 
With shit dribbling down my chin? 
I’d rather stay here.” 

Another called. “Listen, when 
you get there, tell Him. Tell God 
we will praise him day and night! I 
have written a new hymn to his 
name! Tell Him!” 

Benito turned sadly away. 

I looked for Corbett — and found 
him at the outer end of the bridge. 
He was crying and hiccoughing and 
trying to run. I shouted, “Corbett! 
Wrong way!” 

He turned. “No chance! I don’t 
belong here! I’m supposed to be in 
the winds!” 

“You’ll never get up the cliff.” 

“I will! Somehow, I will! I be- 
long up there, not down here 
with — ” He flapped his arms 
helplessly. Corbett had no word for 
these thoroughly damned souls with 
whom Corbett would not associate. 
He went away from us. 

Billy was waiting at the inner end 
of the bridge. He watched us come 
down, then, “Where’s Jerry?” 

Benito shook his head. “Pride. 
He was too proud to stay.”

MEMBER NOSTALGIA? 

How could you forget, for that 
matter? Friends, contemporary 
civilization is in the grip of the 
greatest wave of yearning for the 
(vaguely defined) Good Old Days 
that this weary planet has ever seen, 
and I for one have been finding it 




133 




mostly a pain behind the lap. Hol- 
lywood offers me Paper Moon and 
Summer of ’42; radio offers me Sha 
Na Na and Billie Holiday out-takes; 
television offers Sgt. Bilko and You 
Bet Your Life re-runs (pardon me, 
encore performances); theaters offer 
Bogie revivals and Fields revivals 
and. 

And science fiction offers me the 
Golden Age. 

When was this Golden Age? 
Well, it depends on who you ask 
(who was it who, asked to define 
the Golden Age, said “fourteen”?), 
but the precise dates don’t matter. 
The point is that SF too can now be 
inserted in the classic refrain, 

“They don’t make like they 

used to!” Everyone’s going back to 
the roots, and if that makes sense to 
you, buy your girlfriend(s?) a 
bouquet of roots on your way home 
tonight. 

Put down that axe, sir, and let us 
discuss this like gentlemen. I will 
concede that we live in decadent 
times — they don’t, for instance, 
make guitars like they used to. Ev- 
ery area in which individual 
craftsmanship and professional pride 
have been phased out has declined, 
inevitably. But SF is not produced 
by an assembly line of sullen tran- 
sients, much as it seems that way at 
times, and by its nature it cannot 
help but improve. Mass Man’s out- 
put gets steadily worse, but things 
made by and for individuals always 
get better. No, they don’t write ’em 
like Skylark any more — and no one 



in their right mind would want them 
to. 

To my mind the most astonishing 
thing is just how many of those 
pioneering stories of yesterday stand 
up under re-examination. Trailblaz- 
ers expect the gouges they carve 
into trees to be supplanted some day 
by highway signs, and SF in its 
pseudoprophetic aspect is uniquely 
vulnerable to obsolescence. And 
yet, even if Blowups didn’t Happen 
the way Heinlein wrote them, his 
story is still a gem. Marvelous! 

The bulk of the Golden Age’s 
“forgotten masterpieces” were not 
forgotten but disremembered, the 
way you’ve suppressed the memory 
of the first time you had sex. The 
amazing, the unexpected, the de- 
lightful thing is that so many of 
them are worth remembering today. 

Case in point: The Syndic, the 
first I’ve seen in an “SF Rediscov- 
ery” series from Avon/Equinox. I 
had vague recollections of Syndic 
when it arrived in my mailbox — and 
unfortunately they were confused 
with those of a particularly rotten 
Star Trek episode with the same 
basic thesis. I’m glad I re-read it. 

Cyril Kornbluth took a far- 
fetched premise (Government has 
been supplanted, nationwide, by 
Organized Crime) and built an in- 
credibly rich and incisive adventure 
novel around it. It must now be 
read as fantasy: the ’50s gangsters 
Kombluth knew did not take over 
the government — more the other 



134 




way around. (O beleaguered conl- 
mon man: even the thieves have 
sold you out.) But the Rediscoveiy 
series cover-painting strikes exactly 
the right note of self-mockery, al- 
lowing the premise to be painlessly 
swallowed — and in return for sus- 
pending your disbelief, you get 
superb entertainment. Stylistically 
and in richness of character, it 
stands alongside the best of con- 
temporary SF, and sneers at the 
run-of-the-mill stuff. Experiencing it 
again gave me, for the first time in 
years, that exhilarating almost- 
vision of the kind of thing 
Kombluth would be writing had he 
lived. He died untimely, and I’m 
delighted to meet one of his chil- 
dren again. 

Strange Relations, on the other 
hand, Philip Jose Farmer’s entry in 
the Rediscovery series, was not as 
satisfying to me. I missed the 
stories of which it is comprised 
when they first appeared in the ’50s 
(I was five at the time, just discov- 
ering Heinlein juveniles), but I 
didn’t miss them, if you follow me. 
Of the five tales (lumped together 
because all of them had to do with 
sexual or sibling relationships of 
one sort or another), only “Father” 
impressed me at all. “Mother” and 
“Daughter”, the only two stories 
actually interrelated, struck me as 
sophomoric — do you really want to 
hear a dirty joke about an alien ? 
Even if a human is involved? 

The same objection applies to 
“My Sister’s Brother,” save that 



the w-e-i-r-d nonhuman sex is 
played for horror and pathos instead 
of laughs. Reminded me of the 
hunchback in Candy. The remaining 
story, “Son,” is well-crafted, but 
minor — although it was pleasant to 
see a hero missing clues, failing to 
spot inconsistencies, and generally 
behaving more like a real human 
being than like an epitified Hercule 
Poirot. 

“Father,” however, is a master- 
ful blend of hard SF and theology, 
with skillfully imstereotyped priests 
(a literary feat unequalled since). 
And what do I know — maybe you 
do like Dirty Old BEM jokes. 

More golden age — and here the 
creaking gets a little louder. Well it 
might: we’re not talking 1953 now, 
we’re talking 1938-51. 

The stories in Early Del Rey were 
written in the dozen years it took 
Lester to realize that he was sup- 
posed to be a full-time writer, be- 
ginning with the very first he ever 
wrote. If this bodes ill, remember 
also that none of these stories have 
been anthologized before (near as I 
can figure from the appended 
checklist). You won’t find “Helen 
O’Ley” here, or any of the sure-fire 
classics from the period specified. 
These are the leftovers, and alone, 
bare-naked, I’m afraid a substantial 
number of them are of largely his- 
torical interest. 

But what makes the book worth 
twice its purchase price are the in- 
troductions! Lester sandwiches each

piece with recollections, reminis- 
cences and commentary, turning the 
work into the professional memoirs 
of one of science-fiction’s most col- 
orful personalities. They only 
created the Grandmaster Nebula this 
year (for Robert Heinlein, and long 
overdue), so Lester may have to 
wait a year or two for his. But it 
will be an utterly finite wait. 

You can save the critical 
knife — Lester cheerfully acknowl- 
edges every flaw, absurdity, goof 
and cliche in these stories, apologiz- 
ing (only) where he deems it neces- 
sary. In between he will entertain, 
enlighten and intruct you — in the in- 
imitable Del Rey manner. The book 
gave me much pleasure, and a valu- 
able perspective on some highly 
controversial years and people I 
wasn’t around to see. 

I get another perspective from A 
Requiem For Astounding, written by 
and for devotees of Astounding 
magazine in its Golden Age, de- 
fined by author Alva Rogers as 
January 1930 to January 1960 
(when the name changed to 
Analog), the period the critics will 
probably some day pick as THE 
Golden Age. If you are not familiar 
with at least some of the stories in 
question, you’ll feel like the new 
prisoner listening to the old lags call- 
ing out the numbers of the jokes in 
The Only Joke Book In The Prison 
Library and laughing like hell. Re- 
quiem is only a chronological 
thumbnail sketch, an expanded in- 



dex. Some stories are mentioned 
only by name, some are capsule- 
described, none are described so as 
to bring them to life for a stranger. 
Rogers’ purpose is only to stimulate 
the recall of those who did read 
those stories, as they came out — to 
re-evoke the feeling of what it was 
like to be a young Astounding 
reader in the ’40s. 

Which is entirely interesting, for 
indeed Heinleins walked the earth in 
those days, yea, and Asimovs. But 
an outsider must read between the 
lines, and with great difficulty. 
S. J. Perelman once sold an utterly 
hilarious satire consisting of a 
straight recital of the plot of one of 
the “Captain Future” stories that 
Rogers remembers with pleasure — 
turkeys walked the earth in them 
days, too. The artwork in particular 
is ghastly to the modem eye, glori- 
ous in Alva’s. If you’re not a hard- 
core devotee of either Astounding or 
the field in historic general, you’d 
better pass this up — although John 
Campbell’s “introduction” (he call- 
ed it a rebuttal) ought to be tat- 
tooed on the foreheads of everyone 
in First Fandem. 

One more look backward and 
we’re done. The Ray Bradbury 
Companion by William F. Nolan is 
another labor of love — the kind that 
makes people build shrines to Lana 
Turner or wait in an alley for 
twelve hours for a chance to rip 
Paul McCartney’s lapel off. It is a 
shrine to Ray Bradbury, and as such 



136

serves to support the contemporary 
suspicion that he’s dead (at least as 
a writer of fictional prose). 

Stephen Gaskin, a beatnik 
preacher of great wisdom, genuine 
compassion, and a large and grow- 
ing following throughout the coun- 
try, tells the story of a man who 
came to his door and asked permis- 
sion to follow him around the clock 
and cassette-record and transcribe 
Stephen’s every word and action for 
posterity. As he tells it, he shut the 
door gently and answered one of his 
wives’ “Who was that?” with, “A 
temptation from the Evil One.” 

Would that Bradbury had been as 
astute. This thoroughly embarassing 
Companion does contain some 
worthwhile things: a definitive 
Bradbury checklist, an “authorized” 
chronology of his life of which 
at lfcast half concerns his profes- 
sional career — the sort of thing a 
serious collector might actually de- 
sire (“One man collects stamps, 
another garters. Which is crazy? Or 
both? Or neither?” — Robert Hein- 
lein) 

But the vast bulk (and it sure is) 
of the book is a hideous amalgam 



of all I can call them are 

souvenirs. There is, for instance, an 
enormous selection of facsimilies of 
original manuscripts of unpublished 
works. Did you get that? You’re 
buying hand-written copy that a 
professional couldn’t sell to anyone. 
Along with random pages from 
later-shitcanned versions of Moby 
Dick, photostats of the title page 
and dust jacket of every book Brad- 
bury ever published (world-wide) 
(including re-issues), articles from 
his high-school newspaper, doodles 
for God’s sake — pages of the stuff. 
A map of his home-town, hand- 
drawn I can’t go on. 

Oh yes — it comes in a box. 

Thank god — at last we get to 
brand-new, never before in print, 
modem SF (what do you mean, 
“I’m running out of space”?) First 
up is Combat SF, a compilation by 
the eminently qualified Gordy 
Dickson. Whether you’re a war- 
story buff or not, hawk or dove, 
you’ll be delighted at this multitude 
of perspectives SF has thrown on 
man’s oldest outdoor sport. Gordy’s

selection ranging from Keith 
Laumer’s “The Final Command” to 
Gene Wolfe’s “The Horars of

son’s superb classic, “The Man

nelle, Joe Green, and Gordy himself 
(not a Dorsai story, dammit). Rec- 
ommended without reservation — 
there’s none of that love and sex 
crap in it anywhere. 

Final stage has an ambitious 
premise; editors Ferman and 
Malzberg selected what seemed to 
them The Twelve Themes Of Sci- 
ence Fiction, selected a Name au- 
thor associated with each Theme, 
and asked him or her to write the 
“ultimate” story of its type. On the 
strength of this, they subtitle the 
book “The Ultimate Science Fiction 
Anthology” and charge two and a 
half bucks. This is called leading 
with your chin, or Harlan’s Folly. 

For my money the only authentic 
“ultimate” story comes from Isaac 
Asimov, who to my astonishment 
and horror seems to have actually 
written not only the ultimate robot 
story but the last of the U. S. 
Robots stories — at least, the 
chronologically last (although he 
advises us in his afterword not to 
bet on it). But none of the other 



yarns bear any real claim to ulti- 
mateness (ultimation?). Well, OK, 
Harlan Ellison, under the heading of 
“Future Sex” (along with Joanna 
Russ, to foil charges of sexism) 
does give us what appears to be lit- 
erature’s (if not reality’s) first 
machine-fucker — he obviously gave 
the assignment serious thought. But 
it’s a lousy story. 

Not that the rest are. Tiptree is 
up to his usual high standards, as 
are Harry Harrison, Fred Pohl, Poul 
Anderson and others. It’s a gener- 
ally good book that you’ll mostly 
enjoy — but Ferman and Malzberg 
shouldn’t make premises they can’t 
keep. 

The jaws that bite, The 
Claws That Catch irritated me im- 
mensely. I finished it, but had to 
suppress the impulse to fling it 
across the room several times. It con- 
cerns “spare-parts people,” prison- 
ers paroled as bonded servants and 
mobile organ-banks to the idle rich 
on an unnamed future world that 
seems to exist in a vacuum (well, I 
suppose they all do in a sense, 
but. .). The actions of absolutely 
every one of the individuals and 
groups are implausible and inconsis- 
tent; the protagonist is the most in- 
effectual, unmotivated chump imag- 
inable; the background society is 
inexplicably psychotic; the “land 
sharks” and other mutant pets are 
unbelievable; the plot is aimless 
nonsense; the ending is unsatisfac- 
tory; and the prose limps. I have

heard it said, by Theodore Sturgeon 
among others, that Michael Coney 
is a “Good writer becoming a very 
good one.” I can’t honestly 
disagree — this is only the second of 
his books I’ve seen, and the only 
recent one. But so far I have no 
evidence at all to support Ted. Be- 
ware the Dub Dub Book, and shun 
the Buckanaquatasnatch. 

I’d like at this time to institute a 
custom of occasionally capsule- 
reviewing books that I don’t really 
have room for, but which don’t rate 
being entirely ignored (and some 
that do). I’ll invoke the custom only 
when it seems appropriate, as it 
does now: 

Man The Fugitive and Escape To 
Tomorrow: reissues of Planet Of 
The Apes stuff based on the now- 
extinct TV series based on the 
movies based on the book based on 
a nightmare Pierre Boulle once had, 
and better than you think. It’s sad 
to use a talent like George Alec Ef- 
finger adapting the works of his in- 
feriors, but he improves them con- 
siderably in the process. Good hon- 
est work by a pro — recommended 
light reading. 

2018 A.D. or The King Kong 
Blues: “The bestseller that shocked 
Sweden” is not going to shock 
America. It reads a little like an in- 
ept imitation of Stand On Zanzibar 
as Phil Dick would have written it. 
Lundwall’s pretentious afterword 
about how This Is A Work As 
Much Of Fact As Of Fiction, com- 



plete with a chapter-by-chapter bib- 
liography citing sources like News- 
week, is the final kiss of death. 
Feh. 

The Shattered People: Robert 
Hoskins is a capable and ac- 
complished editor and short story 
writer. This appears to be his first 
novel (at least no others are fly- 
leafed), and a good one, a solid, 
unspectacular, eminently readable 
tale of political intrigue in far-future 
Earth and of the shattered victims of 
the Establishment’s mind-wipe on a 
prison-planet dumping ground. I 
especially like the alien wind 
dreamers, gentle and warmly 
memorable creations. Not great — 
but good. 

With next month’s column, I 
hope to return to coverage of more 
new books (unless they keep delug- 
ing me with reprints), and nostalgia 
will be (I hope) only a memory. Oh 
Lord, that reminds me: run out and 
buy the reissue of Alfred Bester’s 
The Stars My Destination (a 
Berkely paperback) if by some 
chance you’ve never read it. Far too 
long out of print, it is an unques- 
tioned classic with the uncanny 
knack of seeming like it was written 
ten years from now. I’ve managed 
to lose the copy they sent me or I’d 
have remembered sooner. Reading 
Bester has some of the salient as- 
pects of juggling live chain-saws, 
and this is one of his all-too-rare 
masterpieces. 

Forget my typewriter if it wasn’t 
nailed on. ★

ifloONLIGHT SHATTERED OJ1 the 
leaves overhead and lay in shards 
on the ground. The night whispered 
dementedly to itself, like a Zappa 
minuet for paintbrush and tea-kettle, 
and in the distance a toad farted 
ominously. 

I was really stoned. 

I’d never have gotten stoned on 
sentry duty in a real war, but there 
hadn’t been much real fighting to 
speak of lately (this was just before 
we got out), and you have to pass 
the time somehow. And it just so 
happened that as I was getting ready 
to leave for the bush, a circle of the 
boys was Shotgunning. 

Shotgunning? Oh, we do a lot of 
that. It works like so: the C.O. 
( ... “or whomever he shall ap- 
point . ”) fills a pipe from the 
platoon duffle bag, fires it up, takes 
a few hits to get it established, and 
then breaks open a shotgun and in- 
serts the pipe in one of the barrels. 
He raises it to his lips and blows a 
mighty blast down the bore, and 
someone on the other end takes an 
enormous hit from the barrel. 

The C.O. then passes the Shot- 
gun .. 

So as I say, I was more ruined 

OVERDOSE 



than somewhat as I contemplated 
the jungle and waited for my relief. 
Relief? Say, you can take your 
meditation and your yoga and your 
za-zen — there’s nothing on earth for 
straightening your head like a night 
in the jungles of Vietnam-. Such 
calm, such peace, such utter tran- 
quility. 

Something crackled in the bush 
behind me, and my M-32 went off 
with a Gotterdammerung crash two 
inches from my left ear. As I 
whirled desperately about, Corporal 
Zeke Busby, acting C.O. and 
speed-freak extraordinaire, levitated 
a graceful foot above the surround- 
ing vegetation and came down rap- 
ping. 

“Yas indeed private yas indeed 
alert and conscientious as ever yas 
and a good thing too a good thing 
but if I may make so bold and 
without wishing to appear unduly 
censorious would you for Chrissake 
point that fuckin’ thing somewhere 
else?” Corporal Zeke had once 
been a friend of Neal Cassidy’s, for 
perhaps just a bit too long. 

“Sure thing, Coip,” I mumbled, 
shifting the rifle. My eardrum felt 
like Keith Moon’s tom-tom. 

“Yas and a signal honor a signal 
honor my man your gratitude will 
no doubt be quite touching but I as- 
sure you before you protest that I 
consider you utterly worthy worthy 
worthy to the tips of your boogety- 
boogety shoes.” 

A signal honor? He could only 
mean .

“I have selected you from a field 
of a dozen aspirants to make the run 
to Saigon and cop the Platoon 
Pound.” 

I was overwhelmed. The last man 
so honored (a guy named Milligram 
Mulligan) had burned us for two 
bricks of Vietnamese cowshit and 
split for the States — this was indeed 
a mark of great trust. I tried to 
stammer my thanks, but Corporal 
Zeke was off again. “ . situation 
of course most serious and grave 
without at the same time being in 
any sense of the word heavy as I’m 
sure you dig considering the ramifi- 
cations of the logistical picture and 
the inherently inescapable discom- 
bobulation manifest in the neces- 
sary . what I mean . that is to 
say, we’ve only got five bucks to 
work with.” His left eye began to 
tic perceptibly, almost semaphori- 
cally. 

‘‘No problem, Corporal Zeke. 
I’ve seen action before.” Five was 
barely enough for a few ounces at 
Vietnamese prices, but the solution 
was simple enough — rip off a 
Gook. “What did you have eyes to 
score?’ ’ 

“Yas well based on past perfor- 
mance and an extrapolated estimate 
of required added increment to 
offset inflation which some of these 
lousy bastards they smoke ’til their 
noses bleed, it seems that something 
on the close order of five bricks 
would not be inordinate.” 

I nodded. “You’re faded, Corp. 
Get me a relief and I’ll crank right 

142 



now.” He didn’t hear me; he was 
totally engrossed in his left foot, 
crooning to it softly. I put the M-32 
near him gently and split. When the 
Old Man says “Cop!”, you cop, 
and ask how soon on the way back. 

Deep in the jungle something 
stirred. Trees moved ungraciously 
aside; wildlife changed neighbor- 
hoods. A space was cleared. In this 
clearing grew a shimmering ball of 
force, a throbbing nexus of molecu- 
lar disruption. It reached a diame- 
ter of some thirty feet, absorbing all 
that it touched, and then stopped 
growing abruptly. It turned a pale 
green, flared briefly, and stabilized, 
emitting a noise like a short in a 
fifty megavolt circuit. 

With something analogous to a 
gasp, Yteic-Os the Voracious 
materialized within the sphere, and 
fell with a horrendous crash to the 
jungle floor a foot below. Heshe 
winced — well, not exactly — and 
momentarily lost conscious control 
of the pale green bubble, which 
snapped out of existence at once. 

Yteic-Os roared hisher fury ( al- 
though there was nothing a human 
would have recognized as sound) 
and tried to block the green 
sphere’s dissolution by a means in- 
describable in human speech, some- 
thing like sticking one's foot in a 
slamming door. It worked just about 
as well; the Voracious One nearly 
lost a pseudopod for hisher trouble. 

This was serious. 

Yteic-Os was ridiculously 

GALAXY 




ancient — heshe had been repairing 
hisher third sun on the day when 
fire was discovered on earth. En- 
tropy is, however, the same for 
everybody. Yteic-Os had long since 
passed over into catabolism: hisher 
energy reserves dwindled by the de- 
cade. 

This jumping in and out of grav- 
ity wells was a hellishly exhausting 
business; for centuries Yteic-Os had 
sidestepped the problem by using 
the tame space-warp over which 
heshe had so laboriously established 
control. Now the warp was gone, 
galaxies away by this time, and 
Yteic-Os had grave doubts as to 
hisher ability to jump free unas- 
sisted. 

This world would simply have to 
serve. Somewhere on this planet 
must exist a life-form of sufficient 
vitality to fill Yteic-Os' s reserve 
cells with The Force, and heshe 
was not called The Voracious 
for nothing. Heshe extended 
pseudopods gingerly, questing for 
data on cerebration-levels, indices 
of disjunctive thought and the like. 
Insignificant but potentially useful 
data such as atmosphere-mix, tem- 
perature, radiation-levels and gravity 
were meanwhile being absorbed be- 
low the conscious level by the 
sensor-modules which studded 
Yteic-Os’ s epidermis (giving 
himher, incidentally, the external 
appearance of a slightly underdone 
poached egg with pimples). 

A pseudopod like a mutant hot- 
dog twitched, began to quiver. 



Yteic-Os integrated all available 
data and decided ocular vision was 
called for. Hastily heshe grew an 
eye, or something very like one, 
and looked in the direction pointed 
by the trembling pseudopod. 

Yes, no doubt of it, a sentient 
life-form, just brimming with The 
Force! Yteic-Os sent a guarded 
probe, yelped with joy (well, not 
precisely) as heshe learned that this 
planet was crawling with sentient 
beings. What a bountiful harvest ! 

Yteic-Os cannily withdrew with- 
out the other so much as suspecting 
hisher existence, and began pa- 
tiently constructing hisher attack. 

ell, the plan was simplicity 
itself: meet Phstuc My in a bar, 
demand to see the goods before 
paying, pull my gun and depart 
with the bag. Instead, I left without 
my pants. How the hell was I sup- 
posed to know the bartender had me 
covered? 

So there I crouched, flat broke 
and sans culottes, between two 
G. I. -cans of reeking refuse in a 
honky-tonk alleyway, strung out 
and dodging The Man. It made me 
homesick for Brooklyn. At least the 
problem was clear-cut: all I had to 
do was scare up a pair of pants, 
five bricks of acceptable smoke, a 
hot meal and transportation back to 
my outfit before dawn. Any longer 
and Cotporal Zeke would assume I 
had burned him, at which point, 
Temporary Cease-Fire or not, 
Southeast Asia would become de-

cidedly too warm for me to inhabit. 
I was not prepared to emulate Mil- 
ligram Mulligan — ocean-going de- 
sertion requires special preparation 
and a certain minimum of cash, and 
I had neither. 

The possibilities were, as I saw 
it, dismal. I couldn’t rip off a 
pedestrian without at least a token 
weapon, and I was morally certain 
the two garbage cans contained noth- 
ing more lethal than free hydrogen 
sulfide. I couldn’t burgle a house 
without more of the above- 
mentioned prepartion, and I 
couldn’t even borrow money with- 
out a pair of pants. 

I sure wished I had a pair of 
pants. 

A giggle rippled down the alley- 
way, and I felt my spine turn into a 
tube of ice-cold jello. I peered over 
a mound of coffee-grounds and 
there, by the beard of Owsley, 
stood an absolutely dynamite chick. 
Red hair, crazy blue eyes, and a 
protoplasmic distribution that made 
me think of a brick latrine. At the 
mere sight of this girl, certain 
physiological reactions overcame 
embarrassment and mortal terror. 

I sure wished I had a pair of 
pants. 

“What’s happening?’’ she in- 
quired around another giggle. My 
God, I thought, she’s from Long Is- 
land ! I decided to trust her. 

“Well, see baby, I was makin’ 
this run for my platoon, little smoke 
to sweeten the jungle, right? And, 
ah. I’ve gone a wee bit awry.” 



“Heavy.” She jiggled sympathet- 
ically, and moved closer. 

“Well, yeah, particularly since 
my C.O. don’t like gettin’ burned. 
Liable to amputate my ears is where 
it’s at.” 

She smiled, and my eyes glazed. 
“No sweat. I can set you up.” 

“Right.” 

“No, really. I’m General 
Fonebone’s old lady — I’ve got con- 
nections. I could probably fix you 
right up ... if you weren’t in too 
much of a hurry.” She was not star- 
ing me in the eyes, and I made a 
few hasty deductions about General 
Fonebone’s virility. 

“I’m Jim Balzac. ‘Balz’ to you.” 

“I’m Suzy.” 

Six hours later I was back in the 
jungle. I had a pair of pants, some 
four and a half bricks from the 
General’s private stash, a compass, 
two Dylan albums and (although I 
was not to know it for weeks) a 
heavy dose of clap. I felt great, and 
it was all thanks to General 
Fonebone. If Suzy had not found 
life in Vietnam so boring, she 
would never have gone rummaging 
and uncovered the General’s Secret 
Stash, a fell collection of strange 
tabs and arcane caps. She had in- 
duced me to swallow the largest 
single tab in the bunch, an immense 
purple thing with a skull embossed 
on it above the lone word: 
“HEAVY,” and it appeared in re- 
trospect to have been a triple tab of 
STP cut with ibogaine, benzedrine, 
coke and just a touch of Bab-O.

It might just as easily have been 
Fonebone’s Own — the sensation 
was totally new to me. But it was 
certainly interesting. I experienced 
considerable difficulty in finding my 
mustache — which of course was 
right under my nose. 

I could navigate without difficul- 
ty, after a fashion. But I discovered 
that I could whip up a ball of hal- 
lucinatory color-swirls in my mind, 
fire it like a cannon-ball, and watch 
it burst into a spiderweb of multicol- 
ored sparkles, as though an invisi- 
ble protective shield two feet away 
walled me off from reality. With 
care, I could effect changes in the 
nature of the pulsing balls before 
they were fired, producing a variety 
of spectacular fireworks. 

The jungle reared drunkenly 
above me. My outfit was straight 
ahead. I forged on, while in my 
darker crannies gonococcal viruses 
met and fell in love by the 
thousands, all unknown. 

A particularly vivid splash of 
color caught my wandering atten- 
tion; I had absently concocted a hell- 
ish color-ball of surpassing incan- 
descence and detonated it. Its bril- 
liant pattern hung before me a mo- 
ment, as the rush took hold. 

And then it very suddenly van- 
ished. 

I very nearly fell on my face. 
When I had my bearings again, I 
sent out another “shell.” It burst 
pyrotechnically. 

And as suddenly vanished. It 
made a noise best reproduced by

inhaling sharply through clenched 
teeth while saying the word 
“Ffffffup!”; vanished down behind 
a small hill ahead, sucked down- 
ward in a microsecond — only a 
stoned man could have divined the 
direction. 

Something on the other side of 
that hill was eating my hallucina- 
tions. 

I moved to the left like a stately 
zeppelin, caroming gently from the 
occasional tree. But I had two an- 
chors dragging the ground, and be- 
fore I got fifteen feet a tangled root 
brought me down with a crash. 

And just before I hit, I saw some- 
thing coming over the rise, and I 
knew that my mind had truly blown 
at last. 

Coming toward me was a 
sixteen-foot-tall poached egg with 
pimples. 

And then the lights — all those 
lights — went out. 

Yteic-os moved from conceal- 
ment, throbbing with astonished ela- 
tion. No subtle attack was neces- 
sary, no cunning stimulus needed to 
elicit secretions of The Force from 
this being. Heedless of danger, it 
radiated freely in all directions, idly 
expectorating energy-dusters as it 
walked. 

Then Yteic-Os gasped (almost); 
for as it became aware of himher, it 
assumed a prone position, and dis- 
appeared. That is, its physical en- 
velope remained, but all emanations 
ceased utterly; sentience vanished. 



The Voracious One had no means 
of apprehending a subconscious 
mind. Such perverse deformities are 
extremely rare in the universe; 
heshe had in several billions of eons 
never chanced to so much as hear 
of such a thing. This led himher 
into a natural error: heshe assumed 
that these odd creatures emanated 
so incautiously because they had the 
ability to shut their minds off at 
will to escape absorption. 

For, you see, thought is electrical 
in nature, and creative thought is 
akin to a short circuit, occurring 
when two unconnected thoughts arc 
together to form a totally new pat- 
tern. And such was Yteic-Os’ s diet. 

And so heshe made a serious mis- 
take. Heshe stealthily entered the 
empty caverns of Private Balzac's 
mind to try and restimulate life. 
Meanwhile, Yteic-Os’ s own nature 
and essence were laid open to the 
soldier’s subconscious. One of the 
few compensations humans have for 
being saddled with such a clumsy 
nuisance as a subconscious mind is 
that these distorted clumps of 
semi-awareness possess a passion- 
ate interest in survival. Balzac’s 
subconscious remained hidden, 
probing, comprehending the nature 
of this novel threat. A nebulous 
plan of defense formed, was stored 
for the proper time. Yteic-Os 
searched in vain for Thought, while 
Thought watched him from ambush, 
and giggled. 

Consciousness returned to Private 
Balzac with a jar and a

"WHAAAAAT!?!” Yteic-Os, caught 
by surprise, flipped completely over 
on his back and rippled indignantly. 
This upstart would soon be only a 
belch — or something like one. The 
Voracious One licked hisher 
. well, you know what / mean. 



^^haaaaaat!?!” 

I was awake. Somehow it had all 
been sorted out in my sleep: I didn’t 
exactly know what the poached egg 
was, but I knew what it wanted to 
do. I thought I knew what to do 
about it. I would absolutely refuse 
to hallucinate, and starve it to death. 

But I hadn’t reckoned with the 
Terrible Tab I’d swallowed. I sim- 
ply could not stop hallucinating! 
Colored whirlwinds and coruscating 
rainbows danced all around me like 
a mosaic in a Mixmaster; my 
eyeballs were prisms. Slowly the 
creative force of my mind was leak- 
ing away, being sucked into the egg 
before it could feed-back and regen- 
erate itself. 

I was being drained of originali- 
ty, of wit, of inventiveness, of all 
the things that make life groovy. I 
had a grim vision of myself a few 
years hence, a short-haired square 
working in a factory living conten- 
tedly in Scarsdale with a frigid wife 
and a neurotic Pekingese, stumbling 
over the Cryptoquote in the Daily 
News and drinking Black Label be- 
fore the T.V. A grimmei 1 vision I 
can’t imagine, but I still missed it 



when, with a sucking sound, it dis- 
appeared into the poached egg. 

It was quickly supplanted by 
other visions, however — but from 
the past rather than the future. To 
my utter horror, I realized that it 
was actually happening: my whole 
life was passing before my eyes, in 
little vignettes which were slurped 
up by the creature as fast as they 
formed. 

In spite of myself I began watch- 
ing them. In rapid succession I re- 
viewed a lifetime of disasters: los- 
ing my transmission at the head of 
the Victory Parade, getting bounced 
out of bed a hair before climax 
when I accidentally called Betty Sue 
the wrong name, being violently ill 
on two innocent customers of How- 
ard Johnson’s . 

Wait! A light-bulb rather unorigi- 
nally appeared over my head (and 
was eaten by the poached egg). 
Howard Johnson’s!!! My untimely 
nausea had come on my third day 
as a HoJo counter-man, a direct re- 
sult of the genius of Mr. Johnson 
himself. Early in his career, 
Johnson had hit upon the notion of 
urging all new employees to eat all 
the ice-cream they wished, for free. 
He reasoned that they would soon 
become sick of ice cream, and 
hence cut employee pilferage from 
his overhead. The scheme had 
worked well for him — why not for 
me? 

Desperately I rammed my fore- 
brain into low gear and cut in the af- 
terburner. I dug into the tangled 



OVERDOSE 



147 




whorls of my cerebrum for all the 
creativity that heredity and envi- 
ronment had given me, and began 
to hallucinate as fast and as intri- 
cately as I could. I prayed that the 
poached egg would O.D. 

Yteic-os was caught in a quan- 
dary. The Force was radiating from 
this rococo little entity at an intol- 
erable rate, and the creature would 
not stop projecting! Too heavily oc- 
cupied in absorbing the torrent of 
food to roll off hisher back, Yteic- 
Os was lying on the escape-valve, 
similar to a whale’s spout, which 
lay in the center of hisher back. 

The Voracious One screamed- 
after hisher fashion — and tried fran- 
tically to assimilate the superabun- 
dance of food, to no avail. Even as 
heshe thrashed, desperately seeking 
to free the escape-orifice, heshe 
swelled, grew, expanded more and 
more rapidly, like a balloon inex- 
tricably linked to an air compres- 
sor. Heshe lost hisher egg shape, 
became round rather than ovoid, 
swelled, bloated to impossible di- 
mensions, and — 

— the inevitable happened. 

And when i could see again, 
there was scrambled eggs all over 
the place. 

I didn’t hang around. Corporal 
Zeke was delighted to see me — it’s 
embarrassing to have men under 
your command bumming joints 
from the enemy. But he was a little 
disappointed to leant that I only had 



four and a half bricks. 

“That’s okay, Coip,” I assured 
him. “You guys can have my 
share. I’m straight for life.” 

“What?” gasped Zeke, shocked 
enough to deliver the first and only 
one-word speech of his life. 

“Yep. After what I went through 
on the way over here, I’ll never get 
stoned again as long as I live. 
Poached eggs eating hallucinations, 
cosmic invasion, Howard John- 
son — it was just too intense, man, 
just too intense. A man who could 
freak out like that didn’t ought to 
do dope. I’ve had a few bummers 
before, but I know when I’ve been 
warned.” 

Zeke was stupified, but not so 
stupified as to fail to try and change 
my mind. In subsequent weeks he 
went so far as to leave joints on my 
pillow, and once I caught him slip- 
ping hash into my K-rations. But 
like I say, I know when I’ve been 
warned, and you can’t say I’m 
stupid. 

I live a perfectly content life now 
that the war is over. Got me a wife, 
a nice little one-family in Scarsdale 
that I’ll have entirely paid off in 
another twenty-five years, and a 
steady job down at the distributing 
plant — I get to bring home unlim- 
ited quantities of Black Label. 

But sometimes I drink a little too 
much of it, and my wife Mabel says 
when I’m drunk — aside from be- 
coming “disgustingly physical” — I 
often babble a lot. Something about 
having saved the world. ... ★

GALAXY 




In the one city on Earth, a city 
that had known only morning, 
noon, afternoon and morning again 
for a thousand years, the Empress 
grew bored with the color and 
fragrance of her gardens. She had 
the flowers destroyed. Stunted, 
gnarly trees from the Amber Islands 
replaced the flowers. They held her 
attention for a time. 

In a palace that had always 
known light, music and laughter, 
the Empress grew weary of gaiety. 
She ordered the bright tapestries ta- 
ken down and the perennial revel- 
lers expelled. Coarse, black hang- 
ings were brought in, a close, dead 
silence filled the corridors, and the 
Empress was content with the 
novelty of gloom. For a time. 

Then she called Laman to her 
side and said, “Give me a death, 
poetess.” 

“A death, Your Highness?” 
Poetess Laman was a small, round 
woman with a soft voice and a per- 
petually worried expression. She 
had not been feeling well lately; the 
Empress’ recent behavior had seen 
to that. 

“A new entertainment,” said Her 
Highness. ‘‘This morning I have 
come close to something fresh, 
something new and different. I want 
a closer look at it. I want an enter- 
tainment based on death.” 

“But, Your Highness — ” 
‘‘Nothing else is new in my 
life,” the Empress said firmly. “I 
want to see something about death.” 
“But, Empress,” L aman P ro * 



tested, “new surprises arrive every 
afternoon! Just last afternoon I in- 
ventoried a new shipload. All the 
treasures of the Redlands. Things to 
astound you, Your Highness, gold- 
en lizards, stones that sing, birds 
as small and delicate as insects — ” 
“Nothing is new,” the Empress 
reiterated testily. “I’m bored, La- 
man. I now want a new enter- 
tainment.” 

“But the flying jugglers, the 
dance of crystals!” 

“Your colors and lights and 
songs make me fidgit, poetess. 
Your entertainments have become 
dismal affairs.” 

Laman bowed her head. “I shall 
strive for better, Empress.” 

“Better what?” snapped Her 
Highness. “More garish colors? 
Brighter lights, louder songs? No, 
poetess, I do not think that such 
will remedy my ... my restless- 
ness. Give me a death. Show me 
what it is. Tell me what it’s like.” 
Laman repressed a shiver, mur- 
mured assent and left as quickly as 
she dared. She spent several hours 
wandering through the gloomy 
palace, absorbed in her equally 
gloomy thoughts. There had not 
been a death in the palace in a 
thousand years. 

66'T’ 

1 ELL ME ABOUT DEATH,” Said 
Laman to her dead father, Alprex. 

“It’s been a long time since we 
last talked,” answered Alprex, who 
manifested as an unwavering criss- 
cross pattern of greenish light 



150 




superimposed upon the surface of a 
shiny black jewel. The ovoid jewel, 
which was mounted atop a metal 
tripod on the terrace of Laman’s 
apartment, hummed the dead man’s 
words softly. “I had begun to won- 
der if I’d lost my novelty. I had 
thought death a forgotten subject. 
You make an odd request, daugh- 
ter.” 

‘‘The Empress has become in- 
terested in death, Alprex.” 

‘‘Can immortals become in- 
terested in death?” 

‘‘Stop mocking me. Her High- 
ness has fallen prey to boredom.” 
‘‘She is tired of laughing. She 
has turned to ugliness in search of 
newness.” 

“How do you know?” 

“I listen, Laman. The city is full 
of laughter, and it is all desperate 
laughter. The Empress isn’t the only 
one who’s bored. Nor is she the 
first to have succumbed to bore- 
dom. You’re bored, too, daughter. 
How long has it been since you last 
took anyone to bed? When did the 
flavor and aroma of food, or any of 
those little baubles you constantly 
import for Her Highness, or your 
work, last excite you?” 

“Tell me about death,” Laman 
urged, pointedly ignoring her fa- 
ther’s questions. “I have to show the 
Empress what it is.” 

“Why doesn’t she ask her own 
dead?” 

“She wants an entertainment; she 
wants the feel of death.” 

“In that case, let her forego the 



pleasure of her next rejuvenation.” 
“Father!” 

“Have I uttered treason? The 
jewel’s soft hum did not alter in 
tone, but Laman knew that Alprex 
was teasing her. “Do not fret so, 
little poetess.” 

“What if what you said were to 
reach the Empress’ ears?” 

“Why, she would probably have 
me killed,” Alprex retorted. “Be 
calm. I will mind my . tongue 
for your sake. And for my own, as 
well. I suppose I should admit it. I 
would rather be here than in. ... ” 
“Go on, tell me about death.” 

1 can t. 

“I have to know. Her Highness 
must have her entertainment, and I 
have to know something about my 
subject if she’s to be satisfied.” 
“Very well,” Alprex said slow- 
ly. “Death is . vast, and yet it 
presses in so closely that it stifles 
me. It’s dark. Deep.” 

“I need specifics! ’ ’ 

“There are no specifics,” Alprex 
said, very sadly, though the jewel’s 
hum did not change. “Death is all 
generalities. I can’t describe it, can- 
not even hint at it. It’s everything 
the living cannot imagine. The 
closest things the living ever had to 
death were sleep and space. And 
the night. I remember those things. 
We used to surrender consciousness 
in order to dream. We used to go 
out into space. We used to surren- 
der the daylight. We had so much 
that you and the Empress and 
everyone else can’t remember.” 



THE OTHER HALF

Laman said nothing. She gently 
pressed the palm of her hand 
against the jewel, though she knew 
that Alprex could feel nothing. 

“Laman,” hummed the pattern 
of greenish light, “there is too 
much happiness in the world for 
anybody to be truly happy. You 
have lost the dark side of life. The 
other half of your humanity. When 
will you forego the pleasure of re- 
juvenation?” 

“When . perhaps when I’m as 
restless as Her Highness.” 

“Have the times been so interest- 
ing since my death, daughter? Has 
the world changed so much in a 
thousand years?” 

Laman withdrew her hand from 
jewel. “You’d feel at home in it, 
Father. For a little while.” 

The central figure in the new 
entertainment was scarcely more 
than a boy, a slim, nervous youth 
dressed in a tight-fitting suit en- 
crusted with tiny mirrors that caught 
the light and made the wearer bum 
as brightly as the sun. His face and 
hands had been painted white, with 
splotches and stripes of black, to 
simulate naked bones. 

A figure of silver fire, the boy 
danced across the arena, paused be- 
fore the throne and, flanked by his 
markedly drabber and older support- 
ing players, executed a low, grace- 
ful bow to Her Highness. There 
was, however, not the least trace of 
servility in the boy’s posture, and 
Laman cast a quick, apprehensive 



look in the Empress’ direction. 

It was difficult to say whether or 
not the Empress was offended. 
Throughout the prelude to the enter- 
tainment’s climactic sequence, she 
had all but slumped in her seat, ob- 
viously bored with the music and 
the symbolic writhing of the dan- 
cers. But the boy’s oblique imperti- 
nence had not escpaed her notice. 
Her Highness smiled very faintly, 
very fleetingly. Laman felt an un- 
easy satisfaction. 

Yes, the poetess thought, forcing 
her eyes to return to the blindingly 
bright boy, that caught her atten- 
tion. That interested her. Disre- 
spect. Something else that’s new. 

The boy in the suit of mirrors 
turned to salute his troupe. Behind 
them, in the center of the arena, a 
meter-high derrick-like affair had 
been constructed of metal rods 
made in the shape of bones. The 
youth accepted two skull-topped 
scepters from his helpers, turned 
with an almost arrogant flourish 
and, as his somberly garbed sup- 
porting players began to sing a low, 
mournful song, danced lightly to- 
ward the derrick. He twirled the 
scepters in his hands, and blue 
lightnings flashed between the 
gleaming, blurring skulls. 

The boy picked up speed as his 
intricate steps carried him closer to 
the derrick. His dance became a 
running leap, a somersault, the 
scepters spitting blue flame as the 
boy spun. He landed atop the der- 
rick of metal bones and in the same 



152 



GALAXY 




motion turned gracefully to face the 
Empress. Perched there like a 
jeweled bird, still twirling the scep- 
ters, he added his high but full- 
toned voice to the final chorus of 
the song. The dirge suddenly be- 
came a song of hope, of triumph. 
Death the conqueror is undermined, 
Death the harvester is expelled from 
the land of the living, we mock you, 
we scorn you, we make you 
myth. 

The song ended. The scepters 
stopped spinning in the boy’s 
hands. There was a brief moment of 
silence in the arena as the boy drew 
the extended skull-crowned rods up 
and made them arc toward collision 
above his head. Lightning touched 
skull to skull. Fused them together, 
and the boy, and the derrick, in a 
flash that was brighter than anything 
that had been seen in the sky for a 
millenium. Cymbals crashed. The 
troupe sang the epilog. 

Lam an gave the Empress an ex- 
pectant glance. 

“I am curiously dissatisfied,” 
Her highness murmured. 

Laman gnawed the inside of her 
cheek. 

‘‘It lacked something,” the Em- 
press went on. “I was intrigued by 
the pyrotechnical climax. But I’m 
not content. There must be more to 
death, poetess.” 

‘‘Perhaps the choreography was 
awkward in places,” Laman of- 
fered. 

‘‘Pah. I wanted the death, La- 
man. Not the frills.” The Empress 

THE OTHER HALF 



gave her a hard, level look. “Your 
productions grow successively more 
ludicrous. You communicated pre- 
cious little about death, precious lit- 
tle about anything. By the way, 
who was the boy?” 

“I confess that I do not know,” 
Laman answered, trying to keep her 
voice humble, not angry. “A clone, 
arrested in adolescence. I don’t 
know if they’re given names.” 

“He did afford me one moment 
of amusement,” said the Empress. 

“Perhaps if I were to re-think my 
whole approach to death, Your 
Highness. ...” 

“Do that, Laman. Do that. I 
want to feel death. I want to know 
more about it.” The Empress re- 
garded the actors in the arena. They 
stood at attention, facing her, await- 
ing dismissal. “There must be 
something you missed in your re- 
search. Try again, poetess.” 

“Yes, Empress,” Laman said, 
closing her eyes. 

uc 

iJHE WAS ABSOLUTELY COITCCt in 
her estimation of your production,” 
Alprex said. “You’ve lost your 
touch, Laman. No, worse that that, 
you’ve gone from mere staleness to 
outright inanity. I think your dreams 
must be pallid ones.” 

“I never claimed to be your 
equal, Father!” 

“Oh, but you were. Once. Long

ago. 

“I admit my shortcomings. You 
needn’t patronize me.” 

“I’m not patronizing you. You’re 

153 




beset with problems, and I’m trying 
to help you, not make fun of you.” 
Alprex’s laughter was eeriely dis- 
torted by the ovoid jewel’s hum. 
“You’ve done admirably in your 
time, just as I did admirably in 
mine. But there is a limit to inven- 
tiveness. It used to be that artists 
had too little time. Now they have 
too much.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“We lived and died quickly, La- 
man. Too quickly. We were bom, 
we grew up and took our training. 
We worked furiously and feverish- 
ly, never losing sight of the fact 
that we could never get it all done 
before death cut us off. We were 
afraid. But we made use of the time 
we had.” 

“You’re not making much sense, 
Alprex. I’m in no mood to play 
games.” 

“No games, daughter. Don’t let 
your near-total failure undo you.” 

“There was nothing near-total 
about it.” 

Dead Alprex seemed to lose him- 
self within his rock for a few mo- 
ments. Then: “Laman?” 

The poetess said nothing. She 
watched the colorful multitudes on 
the boulevard far below her win- 
dow. Their noise, carried to her by 
updrafts, seemed hollow. She raised 
her eyes to the golden overcast, the 
cloud of atmospherically suspended 
particles which had held the day 
captive for ten centuries. 

“Laman? Are you still there?” 

“Yes, Alprex.” 



“You can only succeed by show- 
ing the Empress that the living can 
know nothing of death.” 

“Enough,” Laman said irritably. 
“I’m tired of talking with you. I’m 
tired of everything.” 

“I know. But listen to me. Death 
has been driven out of the world, 
and with it have gone darkness and 
terror and mystery. I go back a long 
way, I remember many things. I 
remember the night. I remember 
darkness and sleep. I remember the 
terror of death. When I was a child, 
I was afraid of the blackness. I saw 
eyes in it. I found mysteries in it. 
And when the day would come, I 
would be happy. Do you under- 
stand?” 

“No. Please be quiet, Father.” 
“Listen to me, little poetess. Lis- 
ten to me. Why are you unhappy? 
Why has the Empress become fas- 
cinated with that which has been 
denied these past thousand years?” 
Alprex seemed to pause for breath. 
“Because there is too much light in 
the world. Because people have 
forgotten the other half of being 
people. They miss death and fear 
and night and wonder, even if they 
can’t remember the words. They 
miss being frightened of the un- 
known. That, daughter, is the only 
aspect of death which can be ap- 
preciated by the living. Fear of the 
darkness. Fear of what lurks there.” 
“Alprex. ...” 

“Give the Empress darkness, 
Laman. The ancient terror must lurk 
beneath the skin of immortals. Give 



154 



GALAXY 




her light, nothing but light, and she 
will not even pause to reflect that 
she is alive. Give her night, and she 
will see eyes in the shadows. Give 
her the promise of death, the fear of 
death, the certainty of death, and 
her life will be considerably en- 
riched. Life is meaningless without 
death. Day is meaningless without 
night.” 

Laman turned away from the city 
and slowly walked past the ovoid 
jewel on the metal tripod. As she 
was leaving the terrace, she heard 
Alprex call after her, softly. 

‘‘Come see me again, Laman. 
Soon.” 

She went to the Empress and told 
her what should be done, and Her 
Highness said yesss, softly, sibilant- 
ly, and it was done. 

And as the mantle of light began 
to settle about the towers of the ci- 
ty, as the morning abruptly began to 
darken, and the people raised their 
faces in astonishment, Laman made 
her way back to her apartment and 
sat on the terrace, beside the metal 
tripod. 

‘‘You’re crying,” Alprex said af- 
ter a long moment had paused. 

“I’m afraid, Alprex. The lights 
are going out, and I’m afraid.” 

“Savor it, daughter. You’ll want 
to remember it when the morning 
comes. A natural morning, and a 
natural day. And then, if the Em- 
press has been sufficiently im- 
pressed, another natural night.” 

Laman suddenly became aware of 
screams within the palace, of 



moans, of gasps, of shrieked 
prayers to gods for whom there 
were no names. She hugged one of 
her dead father’s stout metal legs 
and felt her teeth going into her 
lower lip. She touched a finger to 
her mouth and stared at the blood, 
amazed. 

“Do you see them?” Alprex 
murmured above her. 

She looked up. 

“Do you see them, Laman?” 

She looked up, past the ovoid 
jewel, the shiny black jewel with 
the criss-cross pattern of light that 
was her father, to a greater black- 
ness. 

“I see them, Father,” she said, 
sobbing. “I see them.” 

The sky was very dark, and it 
was full of eyes. She kept looking 
up. 

“And now,” said Alprex, “and 
now, the next step. Sleep. Sleep.” 

“I don’t know how." 

“Sleep. You can — the air you 
breathe has been cleansed, you will 
remember. Close your eyes, and let 
the darkness come into your head, 
and sleep.” 

Laman closed her eyes and lay on 
the terrace and wept to herself. Af- 
ter a time, she grew quiet and still. 

The jewel hummed to itself. 
“And now, and now, the final 
step.” 

Dreams reigned in the one city on 
Earth, and death waited at the 
gates. 

“Patience, friend,” Alprex called. 
“A little at a time.” ★

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Two comments about the April “Forum”. 

First, that the solutions to the problems 
that plague us are delightfully abundant. 
However, the people who are empowered to 
apply these solutions are awesomely ignorant 
of them. Solutions are useless if the political 
system insists on appointing lawyers to office 
instead of individuals who understand. 
Period. 

If everyone read science fiction, I believe 
the world’s suicidal blind-spots would di- 
minish. That is merely an IF (to borrow the 
title of that late-great mag), just as Fred 
Pohl’s proposals are merely short-term ifs. 

Secondly, the illustration you used for 
FORUM — it bothers me. Black stars, white 
interstellar space, a galactic Yin & 
Yang. .that's intriguing enough. But a 
weightless hour-glass? Did the artist mean to 
imply that the “short-term solution” is as ef- 
fective as a gravity-powered device in a 
weighdess condition? 

Galaxy/IF's flaw is that you can’t read it 
without having to think! 

Thoughtfully,

That illustration was definitely a visually 
mixed metaphor that didn't work! (You 
would be amazed at how many sf-oriented 
people looked at it without catching the flaw 
in the ointment. ..) As for the substance of 
the article and the depressingly real official 
ignorance thereof, by printing such articles, 
in as entertaining a format as possible, we 
are doing what we can. Ifs easy to write to 




Dear Mr. Baen: 

I read with great interest your editorial in 
the March issue of GALAXY in which you 
call for more stories of the “Let’s step 
around it” type and fewer of the “Here we 
are in it” type. The reason that your com- 
ments caught my interest especially is that I 
have been speculating for some time as to 
why I find myself doing more rereading of 
old SF and less reading of new SF. 

It seems to me that there is a certain lack 
of the exuberant vitality of earlier years. (I 
realize that this is an unfair oversimplifica- 
tion, but then, so is everything else I plan to 
say.) From what the critics have said and 
from my own observations, there are two 
explanations that seem most plausable. One 
is the tendency of SF to merge with the 
mainstream; the other is the very nature of 
the times. 

The merging with the mainstream could be 
explained in part by the pressure on any 
ghetto dweller to escape into prosperous re- 



156 




spectability. The mainstream being much too 
sophisticated for exuberance or enthusiasm, 
science fiction must also remove these qual- 
ities if it is to merge. As a result much of SF 
seems to reflect a state of mind redolent of 
the smell of cooking cabbage wafting over 
the dump on a rainy day. 

Combining with the pressure to merge is 
the frightening nature of the times. The prob- 
lems are so real and so awesome that it is 
difficult to see any solution. Even in many 
SF stories that present a solution, the author 
first portrays a bleak situation. The solution 
is then tacked on as an afterthought totally 
out of line with the rest of the story. The 
writer can often be seen rolling up his sleeve 
preparatory to digging around in his hat for a 
rabbit. 

Possibly as an indirect result of the above, 
the SF magazines are struggling, according 
to the critics. Part of the reason. I’m sure, is 
the proliferation of paperback anthologies, 
but another part of the reason might be that 
SF is no longer presenting anything radically 
new and different. The subject matter is dif- 
ferent, but the viewpoint is the same as that 
of the mainstream. 

The conclusion from this line of reasoning 
is that SF is better off in the ghetto. The rest 
of the world is better off with SF in the 
ghetto as well. The ghetto won’t attract as 
many readers, but those it does attract will 
be the ones with the energy and ability to 
solve problems. These people may need the 
radical ideas of a ghetto SF to stimulate their 
own thinking. 

I shall be watching future issues of 
GALAXY with interest to see what sort of 
response is produced by your editorial. 

Sincerely, 
Don Tarbet

Me, too. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I feel that I wuz had. I bought the April 
issue under false pretenses: I saw Zelazny’s 
name on the cover and jumped to a conclu- 



sion. I am ticked off to find that the only 
Zelazny in that issue is a short (albeit a good 
one.) 

I will concede that the April issue is worth 
the buck. I am mollified, to say the least, to 
discover an Arsen Damay serial. That, Geis, 
and Zelazny more than justify the expendi- 
ture. 

Damay is fantastic. He’s been delivering 
on the promise and is ready for a lead role. I 
look for his name, even as a second feature. 
I could imagine him as the top SF writer of 
the 1980’s. You might encourage him to 
confine his talents to novella-novel 
length. .his short stories fail to flatter his 
talent. 

Now, my other complaint: the reason I 
have not entered my subscription during the 
past ten years. 

lflGalaxy costs $1, right. Now, for $2 I 
can get a Solzhenitsyn or a Tom Wolfe novel 
(600+ pages papeiback.) For $1.25 - $1.50 I 
can get a reprint Heinlein I haven't 
read. .or Georgette Heyer, Frank Yerby, 
A. Bertram Chandler, an Asimov anthology, 
ad ihTinitem. .200-350 pages of good 
reading. 

In other words, you have competition for 
my reading dollar. I don’t have to confine 
myself to SF mags — or even SF. I find 
Evangeline Walton fully as enjoyable, or a 
Simak collection, or maybe Pohl/Kombluth’s 
Space Merchants. .or maybe historical fic- 
tion or a classic. And I can get any of these 
in paperback for a reasonable price. I might 
be inclined to skip F&SF (130 pages at 750) 
for Chandler’s Big Black Mark (250 pages at 
$1.25) I know I’ll enjoy the whole book, but 
the magazine is liable to devote 30-50 per 
cent to bland short stories. 

Now, I’m not impossible to please. I was 
delighted with the chance to read Bester, 
Saberhagen, Poul Anderson, Pangborn, 
Clarke and Zelazny serials almost simulta- 
neously, even if I had to buy 3 different mags. 
I bought the June Fantastic solely for the 
Moorcock Novella. But I do want you to 
know, however, that my cash and my free 
reading time are both finite. 

Geis knows where it’s at. He speketh

truth, forsooth. The main problem with the 
shorts cited below is their artistic pretension. 
I have yet to see a stream-of-consciousness 
short story worth bothering to decode 
(Horse). Perfect is a failed shaggy-dog story. 
In-jokes (Singularity) leave me out. Please re- 
strain your artistic impulses. If I want status, 
1 can leave a copy of Gulag Archipelago on 
the front seat when I pick up my college- 
student girl friend. What’s more, in a pinch I 
can actually read Archipelago and enjoy it, 
and show the proper degree of condescension 
toward the Philistine. (Of course, I won’t tell 
him it’s fast, smooth, bin reading.) Dammit, 
you don’t have to be unintelligible to be in- 
tellectual. 

I would have preferred that you kill 
Galaxy and keep If, rather than the reverse. 
Poor me! I, not knowing that If was the cor- 
porate stepchild, enjoyed reading it more. I 
suppose Galaxy had the literary reputation to 
uphold? If could afford to drop her pants oc- 
casionally and have/be some fun. 

You could help me feel happier with my 
investment in Galaxyllf if you would: 

1) Get Pournelle off his duff and onto a 
sequel to Spaceship for the King. He owes it 
after the bind he left his protagonists in. 
You’ve been letting him off easy. 

2) Get Lafferty to fill in more of the space 
you reserve for shorts. He’s one of the. very 
few I know who can satisfy me in the lim- 
ited space. (Tak Hallus and Wolfe do well 
enough, true.) It takes at least as much skill 
to write an interesting short story as does a 
novella. It's a crime to entrust your short 
stories solely to novices. True, most people 
don’t buy a magazine just for one short 
stoiy, but, oddly enough, I for one manage 
to justify the expense of a mag if it has a 
Lafferty short. 

3) Do what you have to, but get Anne 
McCaffrey’s next Dragonworld novel. She 
has to have one, considering the loose ends 
she left in Dragonquest. (Ben Bova, atten- 
tion! I’d buy the next three Analogs for such 
a serial, or Poumelle’s. Little else would 
compel me to do so.) 

None of the others, including Analog, grab 
me. For Bester, yes. I just can’t expect value 



from the backup material. Not even Dickson 
has strong enough pull to do much good. 

On the other hand, I do like Galaxyllf 
most of the lime, or else I would not be 
bothering to write. After all. Galaxy has 
been running some adequate side material. 
Geis is all there. Tak Hallus is interesting, 
and might be Lafferty's logical successor as 
THE short story master, one day. I would, 
however, like to feel more confident I’ll get 
my money’s worth from the whole magazine. 

Oh, by the way, if Pournelle has done his 
serial to Spaceship for the King, or McCaf- 
frey hers to Dragonquest, I apologize for my 
oversight. Perhaps they slipped past me like 
Zelazny’s Guns of Avalon. Drat! I swore I’d 
not let that get by me, after Nine Princes in 
Amber. Yet it sneaked past in the night, nor 
would I have known about it had it not been 
for the preface to your Sign of the Unicorn. 
Thank you for that. As you see, I hate such 
loose ends as not-quite-complete novels. I 
would like to consider my Galaxy subscrip- 
tion as a sort of insurance against missing 
out on the climax of such goodies. Sure, I 
ask the impossible, but I’ve seen Galaxy/If 
deliver. I rather feel you won’t let me down. 

Confidently,

Dear Sir, 

Regarding the comments on Velikovsky in 
your February, 1975 issue, it seems to me 
that nobody has yet mentioned the most ob- 
vious and basic objection to Velikovsky’s 
Worlds in collision, and this is the simple 
fact that a comet can’t become a planet. 

A comet is an “airy nothing”; a planet is 
a solid body. You can’t change one into the 
other.

Jerry’s reply: 

Actually, a number of people have dwell 
jfi length on this. However, what Velikovsky 
means by “comet" isn't what most of us 
mean; he means only a large celestial object 
with a tail. 

If Velikovsky could prove that the world- 
wide disasters he describes actually took 
place, then we’d need a theory to account 
for them; but since in my judgment he can’t 
prove his disasters, I don’t need to discuss 
his cosmology. 

Incidentally, Stephen Jay Could of Har- 
vard geology dept, has done an article tak- 
ing apart Velikovsky" s geophysical data. It 
was in NATURAL HISTORY early this year, 
and answers several of the questions I raised 
in my article but which I didn't feel compe- 
tent to discuss. In a private letter to me Dr. 
Gould compares Velikovsky with Daniken, 
but concludes they are quite different 
phenomena entirely. I tend to agree with his 
observation that Velikovsky deserves serious 
attention even though he is almost certainly 
wrong. Jerry Poumelle 

Dear Editor: 

Frederik Pohl’s description of Mr. Fong’s 
problem-combining process was of great in- 
terest. The solution seems to involve viola- 
tion of traditional political-sociological 
methods of handling poverty; not to mention 
traditional standards of cleanliness (read sani- 
tation). It sounds wonderful to me, but if it 
is economically feasible, a large number of 
poverty program bureaucrats and 
functionaries would eventually become polit- 
ical appointees in unnecessary positions. I 
suspect that they would make every attempt 
to maintain their present status. 

I suspect that the ratio of alcohol to 
gasoline could be increased by appropriate 
engine adjustments; after all, some autos run 
on propane with no operational difficulties, 
except, of course, the ever-present problem 
of finding propane sources for refueling. 
While we are discussing distribution we need 
to consider two other problems; first, the 
reactions and actions of petroleum producers; 
and second, the regulations pertaining to the 



production and sale of alcohol. 

The inexperience and lack of financial cap- 
ital which would be endemic among any new 
“fuel” farmers would also serve to hinder 
the basic program. Finally, and most impor- 
tant of all, would the general form of the 
program be of a sufficiently popular format, 
that a politician seeking to be re-elected 
could, without trepidation, support it fully. 
Politicians generally do not vote for pro- 
grams which are unpopular with their con- 
stituents, even when they are- absolutely 
necessary. 

Changing to another subject, I recently 
saw a program which mentioned that, in 
salamanders and some higher animals (mice), 
stimulus by a negative electromotive force 
aids in re-growth of damaged tissue. I found 
myself wondering if, by any chance, that a 
positive E.M.F. might cause a repression of 
growth. Since cancer is a form of growth 
(uncontrolled), perhaps cancer researchers 
might profit from subjecting clones of can- 
cerous tissues to various electrical potentials. 
Any cell receiving negative E.M.F. is receiv- 
ing an excess of electrons, which I presume, 
might lead to overstimulation of synapses 
and thus to overproduction of chemicals 
needed for growth. Positive E.M.F. would 
drain electrons from the cell, causing a drop 
in the cell’s metabolism. We might discover 
that certain chemicals which are carcinogens 
have the chemical behavior of electrolytes, 
changing the potential of a normal cell. Has 
anyone ever thought to test nicotine for its 
conductivity; I can’t think of any reason that 
it would have been done before, but do we 
really have anything to lose? Researchers 
might test the electrical properties of cells 
from both healthy and cancerous patients and 
compare those properties with the amount of 
diseased tissue in the cancer patients. 

Best wishes for Galaxy’s continued success,

This Vear's nebula Winner! 



THE DISPOSSESSED is speculative fiction at its 
finest. Profound. Mind-expanding. Engrossing. 
And, like most winners of the Hugo and Nebula 
Awards — SF's equivalents of the Oscars and 
Emmys — it's a selection of The Science 
Fiction Book Club. It's yours right now, if you 
wish, as one of four books for IOC when you 
join. Every novel on this page is an award win- 
ner; every collection includes a prize story. And, 
as a member, you can depend on something 
else: you’ll be offered most of Science Fiction’s 
1976 prize winners — at special low Club prices, 
and even before the awards are announced! 




How the Book Club Works: 

When your application for membership is ac- 
cepted, you’ll receive your choice of 4 books for 
just IOC P^s shipping and handling. If not ab- 
solutely fascinated, return them within ten days 
— membership will be cancelled and you'll owe 
nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we'll 
send you the Club's bulletin, Things to Come, 
describing the 2 coming Selections and a vari- 
ety of Alternate choices. If you want both Selec- 
tions, you need do nothing; they’ll be shipped 
automatically. If you don’t want a Selection, or 
prefer an Alternate, or no book at all, just fill 
out the convenient form always provided and 
return it by the date specified. We try to allow 
you at least ten days for making your decision. 
If you do not get the form in time to respond 
within 10 days, and receive unwanted books, 
return them at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selections 
or Alternates during the coming year. You may 
resign any time thereafter, or remain a member 
as long as you wish. Most books are only $1 .96 
plus shipping and handling. Some extra value 
selections are slightly higher but always much 
less than Publisher's Editions. Send no money. 
But do send the coupon today.
