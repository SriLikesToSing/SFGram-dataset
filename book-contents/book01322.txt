Ah, Mars That Might Have Been 



A year or so ago we ran a story 
called Under Two Moons which 
dealt with a notion concerning 
Mars's canals which struck us as 
new: that they did indeed contain 
water, but that the water was cov- 
ered by some sort of surface film 
which prevented evaporation, ex- 
plaining why water is so scarce in 
the Martian atmosphere and at the 
same time why no reflections from a 
liquid surface had ever been tele- 
scopically observed. (It happens to 
have been a story we wrote our- 
selves, which maybe explains how 
come we remember it so well.) 

Now we've just learned of a Rus- 
sian astronomer's theory which ac- 
complishes the same end in a dif- 
ferent way. Fellow's name is V. V. 
Davidov ; and although he first sug- 
gested the idea in 1960, we have 
seen no account of it in the English 
language until just the other day, 
reading the new book by Patrick 
Moore and Francis Jackson called 
Life on Mars (Norton). Davidov 
starts with a suggestion made by 
another Russian scientist, 0. 
Schmidt, that the proportion of 
hydrogen in a planet rises linearly 
with its distance from the Sun — 
it has to, said Schmidt, because of 
his theory of the formation of the 
planets. But what about Mars? It 
not only does not appear to have 
more hydrogen than Earth, it seems 



to have practically none at all, bar 
a faint smudge of ice at the poles. 

Very simple, says Davidov. It’s 
there . but it is frozen: 

Let us imagine our globe with its 
large oceans to be moving along in the 
orbit of Mars. The Increased distance 
from the Sun would reduce the average 
yearly temperature below the present 
one of -40* Centigrade. All our oceans 
would freeze, and would be covered 
with the dust of centuries and the pro- 
ducts of stone disintegration. The abso- 
lute humidity would approach zero, and 
observations from another planet would 
give the impression that there was no 
water on the Earth. The Earth's sur- 
face would appear similar to that of 
Mars. There is a perfect analogy 
between the picture in this hypothesis 
and the present picture of the Martian 
canals. 

rue for Davidov! If only Mar- 
iner IV hadn't come along and 
spoiled the whole thing, what won- 
derful sf stories could have been 
written about his icy Martian 
oceans. 

But Mariner IV did. And not only 
does it make trouble for Davidov's 
theory, it makes trouble for this 
otherwise very good book by Moore 
and Jackson, for the book appears 
to have been written in 1963, and 
there is not a word in it about 
craters or the new findings on 
atmosphereric pressure, etc. It's 
still worth reading — but it would 
have been far more so with Marin- 
er IV's data included! - The Editor

THE 

FOUNDLING 

STARS 

by HAL CLEMENT 

Illustrated by McCLANE 



They were running an experiment 
in the space between the stars — 
but they never knew the result ! 



C 4 \ 11 right — perfect. You’re the 
most nearly motionless thing 
in the universe.” 

Hoey’s words were figurative, of 
course; whether they were accurate 
c r not depended entirely on point of 
view. Rocoo Luisi and his Ymyrgar 
were indeed at rest with respect to 
Hoey and the Anfforddus, after 
more than four hours of maddening 
effort, but neither machine was mo- 
tionless with respect to much else. 
Both were travelling at about four 
kilometers a second, roughly galac- 



tic northward, with respect to their 
home port on Rhyddid, seventy-five 
parsecs away. They were moving at 
a much greater velocity with respect 
to the far more distant Solar Sys- 
tem. With respect to each other, 
however, velocity had been whittled 
down to somewhat less than five cen- 
timeters a year. 

How long this would last was 
problematical. An automatic track- 
er was now on duty in Hoey’s ship, 
trying to hold steady the fringe pat- 
tern produced by combining two 



6 




ultraviolet laser beams, one origin- 
ating in his own vessel and the other 
in Luisi’s, in one of the most pre- 
cise interferometers ever made. 
Since the crafts were about a light- 
hour apart, however, corrections 
tended to be late in time and, in 
spite of a computer’s best efforts, 
erratic in amount and direction. 

“Nineteen decimals” had been a 
proverbial standard of accuracy for 
well over a century; but achieving 
it on any but the atomic size and 
time scale was not yet standard art. 

“That seems to be it,” Hoey re- 
peated. “That means that you and 
I stay strapped in our seats, with 
no more motion than we can help, 
for the next four hours or so. If 
either of the instrument platforms 
on our ships moves more than half 
a micron with respect to the other, 
a lot of time and money go down 
the drain.” 

“I know — I’ve had it hammered 
into me as often and as hard as 
you have.” Luisi’s voice was undis- 
torted, and the responses instant, on 
the medium communicator. 

“Sure you have,” retorted Hoey, 
“only a lot of people wonder whether 
you really believe it.” 

“Well, it depends on what you 
mean by believe. I can figure as 
well as anyone where the center of 
mass of my ship would go if I 
stood up; I — ” 

“I know you can. Your trouble is 
that you can’t believe it would make 
as much trouble as they say. Just 
remember that they were even con- 
cerned about tidal forces from Cin- 
der over there — ” he gestured, 
rather uselessly, at the grossly mis- 



named 06e star glaring at them 
from half a parsec away — “and 
even went to the trouble of finding 
a part of this neighborhood where 
the wind was steady — ” 

“Right there I break connection. 
Space is space. You only worry 
about wind when you’re close to a 
sun, and then it’s only a hard- 
radiation problem.” . 

“True enough, as a rule. The 
trouble is that the usual run of 
stellar winds involves a mass density 
of around ten atoms to the cubic 
centimeter; here it’s a couple of 
thousand. It turned out that even 
that much mass wouldn’t accelerate 
the ships seriously unless the rela- 
tive velocity were very 'high indeed, 
but it was something the planners 
had to check on. You see what I 
mean; so stay put. Let’s cut the 
chatter. The sooner the folks in 
“Big Boy” can get to work, the 
sooner we can breathe comfortably. 
I’ll call ’em.” 

Hoey’s finger tensed on a button, 
replacing the microscopic crystal in 
the activity field of his communica- 
tor with another, whose twin was 
aboard “Big Boy” — more formally, 
the Holiad. He spoke without pre- 
amble, knowing that someone would 
be listening. 

“We’re in position, and my tracker 
says we’re holding. Get the job going 
while the going’s good.” 

4 C TJ ight.” The answer was terse, 

AVbut not casual. The speaker, a 
heavy-set, middle-aged man with an 
almost fanatically intense stare in 
his blue eyes, leaned forward over 
the console in front of him and be-

gan punching buttons in an intri- 
cate sequence. He paused every sec- 
ond or two to interpret the patterns 
of light which winked at him from 
the board. After half a minute or so 
the pattern became fixed, and he 
leaned back, more relaxed. 

“Program A Is running.” A 
younger man, seated at a similar 
console a few yards away, nodded 
at the words. At first he did not 
answer aloud; then he decided to 
speak, though for several seconds 
he was obviously trying to make up 
his mind what to say. It was easy 
to make the wrong remark to El- 
vin Toner. 

“D’you think we’ll get full time 
out of it?” he ventured at last. 
“Those pilots are good, but I still 
wish it had been possible to use 
robotships for the key stations. A 
man can’t hold still forever.” 

“So do I.” Toner answered with- 
out obvious irritation, and his eyes 
remained fixed on his console, to 
the younger man’s relief. “I also 
wish,” the director went on, “that 
it were possible to use the medium 
communicator system directly for 
automatic control of such things 
as distance, so as to get away from 
light-lag. But until some genius in 
your generation works out a way to 
measure the frequency, wavelength, 
and propagation velocity of medium 
waves — or at least, furnishes some 
evidence that a wave phenomenon 
is involved — we’ll have to stick 
with electromagnetic radiation and, 
at times, with human beings. You 
may not like it, but by the time 
you reach my age you’ll have 
learned to put up with it.” 



“I hope not,” Ledermann couldn’t 
help replying. 

“Eh? Why not?” Toner’s eyes al- 
most flicked away from his instru- 
ments for a moment, but didn’t 
quite. 

“I mean that if I learn to put 
up with inconveniences, it’ll be be- 
cause I haven’t been able to figure 
out anything else to do about them. 
Who wants to admit that?” 

Toner grinned. “Nobody wants to, 
I suppose, but the honest people do 
anyway. Hold up; here comes the 
end of the first minute; any irreg- 
ularities on your board?” 

“Not so far. I don’t know what 
that proves, though; all we are 
measuring is what’s going into the 
generators. We can’t touch what’s 
coming out without changing it — ” 
“Of course.” The older man made 
a gesture of impatience. “It’s some 
relief, though to know that things 
are going in right. I don’t know 
about you, Dick, but Program A 
is going to be the second longest 
couple of hours in my life.” 

“I know,” replied Ledermann. It 
was the first time Toner had ever 
been so frank about his feelings — 
even though they were usually quite 
obvious from other evidence — and 
certainly the first time the assistant 
had felt much real sympathy for the 
director. Since the younger man was 
not a fast thinker, the remark left 
him once more unsure of what to 
say. 

As a matter of .fact, there was 
probably nothing to say which would 
have been just right. Toner, like 
most middle-aged men, had develop- 
ed a pretty firm personal philosophy 



8 



IF 




and a rather rigid set of fundamen- 
tal beliefs. The present experiment 
involved very heavily one of those 
beliefs — one which Ledermann did 
not share. 

Although, the assistant thought 
as he glanced through one of the 
Holiad’s great view ports, this was 
a place where it was hard to feel 
sure and right about anything fun- 
damental. 

S pace was not dark, though the 
nebular material which abounds 
in the Orion spur of the Milky Way 
system is never very bright even 
when no planetary atmosphere dims 
it. Getting closer to an extended 
light source, of course, doesn’t make 
each square degree look any bright- 
er; it merely increases the number 
of square degrees. From the Hoi - 
iad’s position, most of the sky is 
nebula-bright; and to a spaceman, 
anything resembling a cloud looks 
wrong in space. In some directions 
the stars blaze steadily, as they do 
from Earth’s moon; other directions 
are blacked out hy light-years of 
dust. Some of the dust itself is 
bright, for 41 Orionis, named “Cin- 
der” by some humorist who had ex- 
plored the region earlier, is only half 
a parsec away. Not only does its 
fierce ultraviolet radiation keep the 
nebular gases fluorescing, but its 
visible is quite enough to light up 
the dust for immense distances. Not 
counting its emission envelope, Cin- 
der is only about five times the 
diameter of Sol, which means that 
it looks like a point from half a par- 
sec away; but that point illuminated 
the Holiad almost as effectively as 



the full moon illuminates the earth. 
Several other O and B stars flame in 
the neighborhood; some look bright- 
er than Venus as seen from Earth, 
some reveal themselves only by il- 
luminating the surrounding dust 
clouds, some are invisible in the 
nebulosity. The Orion Spur is one 
of the cradles of the galaxy. 

Unfortunately, the occupants of 
the cradle are foundlings. The gen- 
eral circumstances surrounding a 
star’s birth are now fairly dear; ships 
prowling the cloudier regions of the 
spiral arms have found them in all 
stages of gestation, from gas and 
dust clouds half a light-year across 
and little denser than the interstellar 
background, through T Tauri var- 
iables hot enough to radiate visibly, 
to the vast population of main-se- 
quence suns whose hydrogen fires 
are safely alight. Like foundlings, 
while an entire birth has never been 
observed in any one case, we know 
enough to picture the circumstances 
with some confidence. 

Also like foundlings, however, the 
precise details of a star’s conception 
are somewhat obscure. It has been 
widely supposed for several decades 
that random variations in the den- 
sity of the interstellar medium are 
the key factor — that the law of 
chance is the father. Dick Leder- 
mann, young and conservative, had 
no trouble accepting this view. To 
him, it was obvious that the random 
“winds” of space must at times pro- 
duce a gas concentration so dense 
that its gravity would override the 
disruptive tidal force of the rest of 
the galaxy — override it enough to 
produce a local potential well able

faith as the normal scientific belief 
that there is a natural reason for 
everything — that some specific, 

widespread, underlying process was 
operating to improve the chance of 
protostar formation. 

He was able to prove that some 
suoh process was needed to account 
for the observed star density. Led- 
ermann was able to prove that it was 
not. Both “proofs” were statistical, 
using the same “laws” of chance. 
They differed, of course, in the 
basic conditions which were as- 
sumed. Both sets of conditions were 
reasonable; the two hypotheses con- 
tinued to survive because neither 
oould be checked adequately. Elvin 
Toner had spent nearly thirty years 
acquiring a professional reputation 
impressive enough to interest a suf- 
ficiently wealthy foundation in do- 



to trap at least the lower energy par- 
ticles of the cloud. 

Elvin Toner, nearly twenty years 
older, had strong reservations about 
the potency of unaided statistics. 
Like anyone with even a modest 
grounding in physical science, he 
realized the basically statistical na- 
ture of many of the universe’s laws; 
he admitted that a star could come 
into existence 'by the concatenations 
of chance which most people took 
for granted; but he doubted serious- 
ly that the random motions of inter- 
stellar gas could set up the approp- 
riate conditions often enough to ac- 
count for the number of observed 
stars, even allowing for the fairly 
impressive lifetime of a star. He felt 
sure — it was as much an article of 





ing the checking. And now he had 
the chance. 

I t had taken wealth — or its equiv- 
alent — and a vast amount of 
human effort. 

The basic check required detailed 
measurement of the positions, vel- 
ocities and accelerations of all the 
particles, as exactly as Heisenberg 
allowed 'and as nearly simultaneous- 
ly as possible, along a range of more 
than five astronomical units. Since 
electromagnetic energy had to be 
used, this meant that the best part of 
two hours would be needed merely 
to set up the web of standing waves 
which was to serve as the “frame- 
work” of the battery of measuring 
instruments, which were themselves 
force fields. 

The basic design of the experi- 



ment was standard — even unimagi- 
native. After setting up the wave pat- 
tern, a period would be spent meas- 
uring the initial vector quantities of 
the particles along the range. Fun- 
damentally, the measuring process 
would be practically instantaneous, 
but scanning and recording would 
use up an hour as the chain of read- 
ing impulses travelled from the 
Ymyrgar along the wave web to the 
Anfforddus, from which the read- 
ings would be transferred by med- 
ium crystal to the mother ship. 

This was “Program A” which was 
now in progress. Electromagnetic 
waves of almost five hundred dif- 
ferent frequencies, ranging from the 
blue part of the visible spectrum to 
the output of a huge electromagnet 
fed by an 'alternating current source 
with a three-hundred-second period, 
were propagating away from the 
Ymyrgar , groping their way through 
the not-quite-empty billion kilom- 



THE FOUNDLING STARS

eters or so which separated the little 
tender from her sister. Some of the 
frequencies had ibeen selected for 
their ability to interact with the 
atoms and ions known to occupy the 
space, some for the fact that they 
would not. Some would be absorbed 
and analyzed by the apparatus 
aboard the Anfforddus, some would 
be reflected back toward their 
source to create the standing-wave 
patterns needed for Program B. All 
would represent a waste of energy 
if the two tiny ships changed their 
relative positions by one part in ten 
billion billion. 

Lights on the control consoles 
aboard the Holaid recorded the be- 
havior, microsecond by microsec- 
ond, of each separate frequency 
generator; but the one which Toner 
never let out of his sight was that 
which kept track of the interfero- 
meter on the Anfforddus. This light 
shone yellow as long as the original 
pattern of fringes remained un- 
changed; a one-fringe shift one way 
would carry it into the red; a sim- 
ilar change in the other would turn 
it violet. So far, while there had 
been at times a suspicion of green 
or orange in its tint, it had held with- 
in the English language limits of 
yellow. 

44T thiqk you can relax a little,” 
X. remarked Ledermann. “All 
the. general run of disturbances 
should have had their licks by now; 
A has been cooking for over half 
an hour. Unless Hoey or Luisi has 
a fit, their ships can hardly move 
enough to make trouble.” 

“They both had EEG checks be- 



fore they were hired.” Toner was 
not joining in any levity, yet. “I’m 
not worried about that possibility.” 

‘Then why not take it easy? Sure- 
ly you’re not worrying about a 
meteor.” 

“Well — comet nuclei are found 
pretty far from suns, but I really 
wasn’t thinking of anything specific. 
It’s just that so little need go wrong 
to wreck the whole works. Program 
A isn’t so bad, in spite of the pre- 
cision we need; but when B gets go- 
ing it will really mean something. I 
can’t keep my mind off that.” 

Ledermann nodded. Program B 
was the experiment itself — the check 
on the Toner hypothesis. In assum- 
ing that non-statistical forces ex- 
isted which tended to start inter- 
stellar matter drawing together in- 
to protostars, the astronomer had 
not fallen back on mysticism. He 
had computed many combinations 
of electric and magnetic fields which 
should have such an effect, and 
which might reasonably — or at least 
conceivably — exist along the arms 
of the Milky Way. The wave pat- 
terns of Program B had been de- 
signed from these computations. 
Naturally, phenomena as complex 
as, say, the human nervous system 
or even the circuitry of a television 
set or the measuring patterns of 
Program A would be no improve- 
ment on pure chance as an explan- 
ation for star formation; such things 
were too improbable by any stand- 
ards. Toner’s fields were simple 
enough so that, in his opinion, they 
were more probable than random 
gas and dust concentrations. They 
were also complex and extensive 



12 



IF 




enough so that looking aro<und for 
examples of them already in exist- 
ence seemed impractical — so far. Of 
course, if Program B showed that 
such fields would, or could, produce 
the results Toner expected, he would 
have little trouble financing such a 
search. 

If the program failed to give the 
results Toner hoped for, Ledermann 
was both unsure and uneasy about 
what to expect. Few men can aban- 
don a favorite hypothesis abruptly 
and completely, and the need to do 
so can have painful effects. 

Actually, Toner would not be 
forced to such an extreme at first; 
many more variations on the orig- 
inal theme would have to fail before 
the whole idea would have to be 
abandoned. What bothered Leder- 
mann was the doubt that the foun- 
dation would go along with any 
such extension of the project and 
how Toner would react if it refused. 

Actually he needn’t have worried. 
The director was philosophical 
enough to take such a problem in 
his stride. Since the younger man 
had no way of knowing this, he 
watched his console with even more 
anxiety than his director — in spite 
of what they had both been saying. 

But the green lights stared un- 
winkingly back at them, as the 
waves spread across space. No news, 
with the proverbial implication. The 
clock was the only instrument which 
showed change; the clock, that is, 
and two human nervous systems. 

“Stuff coming in from Hoey’s re- 
ceivers,” Ledermann reported ab- 
ruptly. Toner nodded. 

“On time,” was his only answer. 



Neither bothered to ask, or to say, 
what sort of stuff was coming in; 
the data was no more meaningful to 
human senses than were the photons 
which carried the first Mariner pic- 
tures from Mars. The main thing 
was that news was coming in; it was 
being recorded; it could, in due time, 
be decoded; and — Program^ B was 
due to start. 

Both men sat up a little straighter 
and stared more tensely at their con- 
soles as the light patterns began to 
change. 

S imultaneously — the word was as 
nearly truthful as it had ever 
been in human history — sets of el- 
ectromagnetic fields began to grow 
around both the Ymyrgar and the 
Anfforddus. 

Neither set was complete by it- 
self, but their interference would 
produce something which Leder- 
mann thought of as a huge lens. 
The analogy was a poor one geo- 
metrically, but has some excuse 
from a functional viewpoint. Drift- 
ing slowly with respect to the sur- 
rounding gases, many of whose 
atoms were ionized, it should — if 
Toner were right — tend to deflect 
their relative motions toward its 
own “optical axis.” To that extent, 
Toner’s idea was a sample one. The 
precise pattern of fields which 
should have the desired effect was 
somewhat less so, as any engineer 
who has been involved with an elec- 
tron microscope would expect. 

Each “lens” of the series making 
up the program was to be followed

to those of Program A, so that its

individual effect on the motion of 
the nebular particles could be meas- 
ured. In principle, the whole thing 
was easy . 

“Intervals seem to be right.” Led- 
ermann dredged a little good news 
out of his light pattern. “Four sec- 
onds, plus or minus ten to the minus 
tenth. Interlens distances are within 
tolerance, I’d say.” 

“If we haven’t been too grossly 
off in computing the refractive in- 
dex of the nebula — ” 

“Which is handled automatically 
by the original A measures, as I 
understood the plan. Calm down, 
Boss.” 

“All right. You’re talking a little 
louder than usual yourself. I still 
wish you’d invent a method for us- 
ing the communicator medium for 
direct viewing; we could see whether 
these things are building right, in- 
stead of having to infer from gen- 
erator behavior — ” 

“Maybe we could. I’m a conser- 
vative; I still buy the Uncertainty 
Principle. Even if we could do any- 
thing with the medium which would 
make it react to something besides 
a communicator crystal, I bet it 
would affect the thing we were try- 
ing to measure.” 

“It doesn’t affect the crystals — 
just the space around them.” 

“Not measurably. Has anyone 
tried to check on them, to within 
fifteen figures of what we’re doing 
now?” 

“Not as far as I know. I — Dick! 
What happened then?” 

L edermann didn’t know either. 
At least, he didn’t know in the 



sense that Toner wanted to. Like the 
director, he had seen every light on 
his console except the one indicat- 
ing tender separation turn a solemn 
red for a full second, and then 
switch back to green. If they had 
been looking away for that second, 
the men would not have known that 
anything had ever been wrong; after 
the event, the lights stared back at 
them, apparently unchanged. 

The first thought to occur to both 
men was that something had hap- 
pened to the console circuits; the 
second, that something had hap- 
pened to their own nervous systems. 
Three seconds of checking with test 
switches seemed to dispose of the 
first possibility; and since they had 
both seen the same thing, the second 
was very low on the probability list. 

Toner frowned, and spoke very 
slowly. 

“If that is to be taken at face 
value, everything in both tenders 
which was putting out program rad- 
iation stopped for about a second 
and then started up again — all to- 
gether. That would cause a gap of 
about three hundred thousand kil- 
ometers in the wave pattern — at 
each end — with the gaps due to 
meet in half an hour; let’s see— 
what would that do to the lenses?” 

“If you can work that out in your 
head, especially with only estimated 
time data, you didn’t need to set up 
this experiment at all. You must 
have put the universe together in the 
first place,” retorted Ledermann. 
“There’s no more chance of telling 
that than of telling which of my next 
half million coin tosses is going to 
be heads.” 



14 



IF 




“True.” For a (man whose work 
was taking such a Wow, Toner 
seemed remarkably detached. “That 
would suggest that we should cut off 
our generators, let the present set of 
patterns radiate out of the area, and 
start over.” 

“We’d have to do more than that. 
The gas in the area has prboably 
been affected by the part of B which 
has already gone out. We’d have to 
move the tenders to a different area 
altogether and set up the whole 
works again. Wouldn’t it be better 
to let this program run itself 
through? We don’t really know that 
the generators did stop; test circuits 
or no test circuits, I find it easier 
to 'believe that something messed up 
the indictators than that the whole 
set of generators went out and 
came back on again at once. If we 
let things run, the worst that can 
happen will be the loss of a couple 
of hours — and we might not have to 
start over, if this run is really all 
right.” 

“You’re partly right. Letting it 
run won’t cost us much time. But we 
will have to do it over anyway; we 
won’t be able to tell if the first run 
was really okay until we get the data 
reduced, which we can’t do here. 
We’ll just' have to do the whole thing 
twice.” 

And Ledermann slowly nodded 
his head. 

H oey’s reaction, some hours later, 
was more impressive. He and 
Luisi were celebrating their release, 
to the accompaniment of an impro- 
vised song whose burden was the 
supreme difficulty of doing nothing 



at all, when Toner broke the news 
as gently as possible that the whole 
thing would have to be done over. 

He wrapped the information in 
flattery, lubricated it with all the 
soft soap he could bring himself to 
use, and sweetened it with a respect- 
able bonus offer; but neither pilot 
accepted the word at all philo- 
sophically. They were still visibly 
nettled sixty hours later when the 
tenders once more pulled away from 
the Holiad. This may have had 
something to do with the results. 

They did calm down again, just a 
little, during the setup of the meas- 
uring line, however. Earlier practice 
may have helped, for it took them 
less than ninety minutes this time 
to get their little vessels “fixed” rel- 
ative to each other. 

“That’s it, Doc!” Hoey’s voice 
was almost jubilant. Toner, who had 
pretty well convinced himself by this 
time that the first run had really 
been all right, was able to answer in 
similar mood. 

“Good going — that was very 
quick work. I’m starting the A tapes 
now. About how far are you from 
where the other run was made?” 

“A couple of flight-hours, I’d say; 
we didn’t try to check it exactly. 
You didn’t say it was necessary.” 

“It isn’t. Relax. And I do mean 
relax ” 

“I know, Boss. We’re getting used 
to it. Let things roll.” 

“They’re rolling.” 

Even in the calmer atmosphere of 
the second run, tension built up a 
little during Program A. Even 
though this part had gone without 
a visible hitch the first time, there

was supposed to remain through the 
experiment. The muscular convul- 
sion of the sneeze snapped that head 
some twenty centimeters forward 
and down. 

The Anfforddus had, roughly, a 
million times the mass of Hoey’s 
head, so its center of mass moved 
only about a millionth as far. This' 
amounted to about a fifth of a 
micron. The fact that this was with- 
in the set tolerances for the experi- 
ment did not at once dawn on Toner 
— for one thing, it would have taken 



him a moment to figure it out un- 
der any circumstances, and for an- 
other his reaction was reflexive 
rather than rational. He was like a 
confirmed anti-vivi sectionist react- 
ing to an account of a mechanical 
heart’s being tested on a dog; he ex- 
ploded. He jumped — much farther 
than Hoey, though fortunately it 
didn’t matter how much the Holiad 
moved. He also began to talk, 
though just what he said is uncer- 
tain — Ledermann charitably wiped 
that part of the monitor tape, later. 
It took the younger man some thirty 
seconds to calm his superior down 
enough to listen to reason, and per- 
haps fifteen more to supply the 
reason. Another five seconds passed 
while Toner actually recovered con- 
trol of himself, and started to ap- 
ologize to Hoey. 

B ut Hoey did not hear the apol- 
ogy — we think. 

In the fifty seconds or so since his 
sneeze, radiation from his ship trav- 
elled some fifteen million kilome- 
ters. This is easy to compute; it is 
pretty certainly a fact. It may pos- 
sibly be a useful one, though no one 
so far has put it to any real use. 

The trouble is, of course, that 
there is no way to be sure whether 
the sneeze put any significant alter- 
ation into the radiation pattern 
which the Anfforddus was broad- 
casting. This, equally of course, is 
because no one can be sure just how 
big a change must be in order to be 
significant. 

Toner had just started to talk in 
a normal tone when Ledermann 
gave an astonished yelp; and the 



THE FOUNDLING STARS 



17 




director, whose attention had shift- 
ed entirely to the screen of the med- 
ium communicator, looked back at 
his console. 

Its lights were out. It was blank. 
So, when he turned back to it, was 
the medium screen. And so was 
Ledermann’s console. 

One hundred seconds later, after 
repeated calls to the tenders had 
proven futile, the Holiad’s captain 
snapped her into irrelevance drive. 
Between four and five seconds later 
still, a hundredth of a parsec from 
where she had been lying, the re- 
search vessel halted again. Presum- 
ably she was within a few tens of 
thousands of kilometers of Hoey’s 
tender, but no sign of the little ship 
could be detected by eye or instru- 
ment. 

Calls continued to go unanswered. 
Searchers went out with detection 
and rescue equipment; the former 
gave no response, the latter went un- 
used. Not a particle of solid matter 
could be found within light-minutes 
of either tender’s former position; 
and it was not until much later, 
when the routine sample-bottles 
were being checked back on Rhyd- 
did, that the slightly high count of 
aluminum atoms in -that particular 
volume of space was noticed. 

Of course, this may not be a sig- 
nificant fact, either. 

\ nd just who was that?” The 
\ query came in the growl 
which seems to be a distinguishing 
property of sergeants, whether their 
linear dimensions be two meters or 
two hundred astronomical units. It 
received no immediate answer. 



“Well? Who was it? It came from 
just about where you should be, 
VA741. Was it you?” 

“I — I guess so.” 

“You guess so? A soldier lets out 
a yelp that can be heard half way 
across the spiral, and he only guess- 
es that he did it?” 

“I did it, I— I—” 

“You did. Never mind the guess- 
ing. Why did you do it? You know 
why we’re here?” 

“Yes, Sergeant.” 

“You know what we’re doing 
here?” 

“Yes, Sergeant.” 

“In fact, up to now you’ve been 
helping to do it.” 

“Yes, Sergeant.” 

“And you know why we’ve been 
sweeping this stuff together.” 

“Yes, Sergeant. To clear a path 
for—” 

“Shut up. How much use will the 
path be if the Flickers find it before 
our boys have a chance to come 
through?” 

“Not much, I suppose, Sergeant.” 
“You suppose. Well, I suppose I 
should be glad it even occurred to 
you. Now that you’ve squealed like 
a stuck baby, how long do you sup- 
pose it will be before Flicker scouts 
are poking around this cloud?” 

“I don’t know, Sergeant.” 

“I don’t know either, but I’ll be 
very surprised if we drift a hun- 
dredth of the way around the spiral. 
If it were possible to travel faster 
than radiation, they’d be spearing 
you before you cleared another 
cubic parsec.” 

“They may show up anyway; we 
can’t tell yet.” 



18 



IF 




“That, soldier — I use the term 
loosely — is the only reason you’re 
not under formal charges right now. 
If we’re spotted in the next little 
while — say, before the cloud you’re 
sweeping up right now starts to ra- 
diate — I’ll assume it wasn’t your 
fault. But if we’re found after that, 
when that squeal of yours has 
spread out a few hundred parsecs, 
you’re in for it. What I ever did to 
be saddled with a — ” 

“But Sergeant, I couldn’t help it. 
Something bit me.” 

“So something bit you. Let it bite! 
Since when — ” 

“But I really couldn’t help it. It 
did something to my muscles, and I 
twitched so I thought someone 
might spot me anyway; but I re- 
laxed and even damped out the spot 
with dope. I know how important 
it is not to make a disturbance. The 
sensation quit for a moment, but 
then it came back stronger than be- 
fore, and before I could take an- 
other tranquilizer I cramped up 
tight all over. I couldn’t help giving 
a little yelp — ” 

“Little? It was loud enough to — 
never mind. I hope you can produce 
whatever bit you; it may help in 
court. After all, I suppose anything 
which can Interfere with even a 



sloppy soldier’s self-control might be 
usable as a weapon. If we could 
breed more of ’em — that’s an idea. 
See if you can catch it, without mak- 
ing too much noise.” 

“I’m afraid I didn’t think of that 
in time, Sarge. We’ll never catch 
that one. The whole business was 
just reflex, and I’m very sorry, but 
I swatted it without thinking.” 

In addition to their voice quali- 
ties, sergeants are sometimes known 
for a certain gift of rhetoric. This 
one, DA6641, of the 44th Com- 
pany, 6261st Field Engineering 
Battalion, Army of the Republic of 
Whilth, was no exception. 

If he had not been careful to 
use only short radiation in his re- 
marks, they would have been aud- 
ible back in Whilth, in the spiral 
arm of the Milky Way next outward 
from Sol’s. Even with the short 
waves, he might possibly have made 
an impression on the Holiad’s in- 
struments; but of course the Holiad 
was no longer there. 

Long before he had really made 
himself clear about just what sort 
of poor excuse for a soldier the un- 
fortunate VA741 was, both Elvin 
Toner and Dick Ledermann were 
dead of old age.

IF • Short Story 



Slot Machine 

by H. B. MICHEL 



Easy come, easy go — what's 
a human being more or less? 



H e had been so absorbed in 
watching the (machine that he 
hadn’t noticed he was crushing the 
next human against the thorn on the 
center of his palm. 

When the lights stopped flashing 
and the gears stopped clicking, he 
noticed, and he flung the mangled 
remains to the floor. 

He glanced over at his wife, but 
she hadn’t said anything yet. He 
knew she was thinking, Dear, hu- 
mans are scarce in times like these, 
but she said:. 

“It’s all right, dear. We can be 
extravagant now and then.” 

He wiped the human juices on his 
thick, moddled side and returned to 
the machine. 

“We can be extravagant any time 
we please,” he said, knowing it was 
a lie. He squinted closely at the 
gleaming contraption, trying to force 



his mind into its inner workings. He 
even whipped an eye over the top 
of the machine and scanned the 
back. But there was no clue to help 
him comprehend what was really 
happening. “Give me another hu- 
man,” he said. 

She had been clutching the purse- 
box in her upper-left, and she hesi- 
tated reluctantly. It had rarely con- 
tained so many humans. “But we 
just got them,” she said. 

He didn’t look at her, but reached 
out his upper-right. “Another hu- 
man,” he repeated. 

“But can’t we hold onto them a 
little longer?” 

Without a word, he snatched the 
purse-box away. There was a group 
cry from within. 

“Dear, you’ll kill more of them!” 

“I won’t!” he said and reached 
into the box. 



20 




The first human was a female, 
naked and tiny. It cried. It seemed 
to have a broken arm. 

“I’m been wondering,” he said. 
“The females are supposed to be 
smarter, but the males are bigger 
and stronger. Which would work 
best?” He considered a moment and 
returned the female to the box, noting 
absently that the government serial 
number on her back indicated that 
she’d been issued just this year. She 
wouldn’t be much good in the ma- 
chine, though, with that broken arm. 
He’d try to get rid of her later, at a 
filling station maybe, as they left 
town. 

He brought out a male. He could 
tell more by texture than anything 
else. 

“Here goes nothing,” he said and 
dropped it down the chute in the 
machine. 

Almost immediately, lights start- 
ed to flash, then wheels turned, pick- 
ing up speed. 

He felt his wife’s upper left on 
his lower right. It was uncomfortably 
dry. 

Suddenly the lights and the wheels 
stopped. 

Silence. 

He thought he heard a faint groan 
of humans in the machine. 

Nothing. 

“Maybe a female — ” he said. 

“Dear — ” 

“Just one more!” He confronted 
her. “We won’t miss it.” 

She was silent. 

“Anyway,” he continued, “how 
many times do we come to this 
town? Never. We might never come 
back!” 



“I just thought — ” Dreams of 
getting an extra bill paid back home 
faded. 

“We can’t say we were here and 
didn’t do anything!” he said. 

H e selected a female this time. It 
seemed to be healthy, but fair- 
ly limp. Perhaps from. the banging 
around in the purse-box. 

“Brains over brawn. We’ll see.” 
He deposited the female in the 
glistening metal box, and they waited 
again. The lights flashed and the 
wheels started up. 

“What do they do in there?” his 
wife asked. 

“I don’t know exactly,” he said. 
“Maybe we aren’t supposed to know. 
But I’ve heard that a set of instruc- 
tions drops down — a different 
combination each time — and the 
human has to perform a certain set 
of tasks.” 

Some new lights were flashing, 
and the wheels spun faster. 

“Look at that! Maybe this time!” 
The machine stopped. 

They stared at it. 

This time he knew he heard a 
groan from inside. 

“We’re closer,” he said tightly, 
and reached into the purse-box. 

“Dear, we can’t. We have to have 
humans to get home.” 

“How many have we got left?” He 
felt around in the box. “Seven,” he 
said triumphantly. 

“And we onfy came in with six.” 
“Easy come, easy go,” he said 
absently, trying to find a healthier 
female. There was none. Only the 
one with the broken arm, who 
screamed when he touched it.

> “We’ll need at least five for rocket 
fuel, Dear.” 

He was trying not to sihow his 
worry. “We’ll have to use a male,” 
he said. “I don’t know. The first one 
we used, the one that worked, was 
a male. But we haven’t had any luck 
with them since.” He calculated. 

“You don’t have much choice.” 
His wife was resigned. She only 
hoped he wouldn’t use any more 
than this next one. 

He shrugged and his dorsal spines 
quivered. 

A male was randomly chosen. 

“Here goes nothing!” 

A nd there was nothing. At first. 
They waited, not respiring. 
Then the lights flashed. 

“Here we go!” he said. 

The wheels were spinning. 

They gazed at the machine, front, 
back and both sides. 



“Dear?” 

“What?” 

“What would happen if they 
wouldn’t — I don’t mean couldn’t 
— but wouldn't do the tasks?” 

More lights were on. 

He forced a chuckle. He wanted 
to show he wasn’t nervous. 

The machine was clattering. 

“They always try to do them!” He 
was yelling now, over the jangle of 
bells. “Like on that first one we 
played. It’s the only way to let the 
rest of them out! 

“Bells!” he screamed. 

“Another jackpot?” 

The machine quit. The bells went 
silent and the lights went out. The 
wheels ground to a stop. 

From inside the machine, a louder, 
more agonized groan, but not with- 
out hope. 

Two cherries and a bell.

PEACE 

CORPS 

by ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



Illustrated by FINLAY 



The enemy could not be seen — 
but it struck out of emptiness 
to destroy Earth's defenders! 



I 

H e had reached Barth on a moon- 
ship which had set down with 
a great blowing of jets on the land- 
ing area in the sand of the Great 
American Desert in Utah. 

Now he was riding the monorail 
train that would take him from the 
desert spaceport to Salt Lake City. 



From this point, he intended to take 
a jet jumper to the World Govern- 
ments complex of buildings located 
on the high plains of Colorado near 
the old city of Denver, where he 
would report to his superior officer 
— if he lived long enough — on 
certain events he had personally 
witnessed on the moon. In his pri- 
vate book of odds, it was not at all 



23 




certain that he would live long 
to reach the individualized, person- 
alized and completely unpublicized 
World Governments unit, which em- 
ployed him as a completely willing 
slave. 

His name was Jim Jiro. 

Jiro often gave people the im- 
pression he was a skeleton that: had 
put on clothes and had gone for a 
walk. He was that thin. But the im- 
pression that he was a skeleton was 
a delusion. His thinness resulted 
from a training program made nec- 
essary by his work. This training 
program did not leave an ounce of 
surplus fat anywhere on his body. 
Or in his brain! In his line of work 
the difference between life and 
death could be a little extra fat on 
the brain. 

Sitting in the car on the monorail 
train, talking volubly to the man 
who shared the seat with him, Jim 
Jiro looked and talked like a sales- 
man of special rock drills and their 
associated power equipment, like 
one of those men hardy enough and 
eager enough for sales to make the 
jump to the moon colony establish- 
ed on the satellite in 2210, now 
twenty years in the past. In his lap 
an elaborate sales brochure was 
open, showing how rock drills were 
tapered, how they were sharpened 
and how they were hardened. The 
fact that he had taken the sales 
brochure from the brief case of a 
dead salesman on the moon and had 
invented the sales pitch did not make 
him any less convincing in his talk. 

The man to whom he was talk- 
ing was also a salesman, a big fel- 
low with a black mustache. Polite- 



ly agreeing with everything Jiro said, 
it was obvious that he wanted to 
steer the conversation in a direction 
that would enable him to talk about 
his lane. 

“Some of that moon rock they’re 
mining is tough, believe me,” Jiro 
continued. “There’s nothing like it 
on Earth. When they discovered 
those rich mineral deposits on the 
moon and started trying to mine 
them, they found that tjie rock was 
harder than the teeth of their power 
drills. The same was true of their 
giant mechanical diggers. My firm 
had to develop special drills to do 
the job. The only bit that will cut 
that rock had teeth like these.” 

R eaching into his brief case, he 
removed from it a small leath- 
er case. Opened, the case revealed 
three black stones about as big as 
pigeon eggs. Each was wrapped in 
gauze. 

“Black diamonds,” Jiro said, en- 
thusiastically. 

The other salesman stared polite- 
ly at the round stones. “They don’t 
look like diamonds,” he said. 

“That’s what they are just the 
same,” Jiro said. 

“And they look too smooth to do 
much cutting,” the salesman con- 
tinued. 

“That’s because they’ve been used 
and the cutting facets have been 
ground off of them by that tough 
moon rock,” Jiro explained. “I 
brought them back to show the 
company metallurgists. 

“I’m with Allied Cutting Tools, 
you know. Biggest outfit of its kind 
in the world. Today, we are supply- 



24 



IF 




ing the drills that cut the rock on 
the moon. Tomorrow, we will be 
supplying drills for Mars and Venus. 
And I’ll be there selling them. And 
after that, we will supply drills for 
the stars, only I won’t be there sell- 
ing them.” 

Wonder and sadness mingled in 
his voice, wonder at the thought of 
men going outward to the stars, 
sadness because this could not hap- 
pen in his lifetime. 

Closing the little leather case, he 
carefully slipped it back into his brief 
case. 

“If I don’t make it, get these to 
the boss,” he said, maintaining the 
same calm tone. 

“Sure thing,” the salesman an- 
swered, equally calm. 

“Salt Lake City in ten minutes,” 
a speaker announced from the front 
of the car. 

“So soon?” Jiro said, startled. 
“Well. It was good to talk to you. 
My name is Jim Jiro. What’s your 
line, sir?” 

The second salesman seemed to 
have been waiting for this oppor- 
tunity. Now that it had come, he 
grabbed it. 

“My name is Calkins. I just got 
in from the moon too. I handle 
drugs, cosmetics and associated 
items.” 

“Did you do well up there?” Jiro 
asked. 

The ends of the black mustache 
drooped as Calkins put on an un- 
happy face. 

“The moon is simply not in the 
supermarket category yet. I’ll be 
lucky if I met expenses. Before I 
left, I tried to tell my company that 



there simply weren’t enough people 
living on the moon as yet to make 
our line profitable up there, but they 
insisted I go anyhow to lay a foun- 
dation for the future. They’re al- 
ways talking about the future, and 
I think — ” -he glanced sideways at 
Jiro. “I think they’re dreaming" of 
the days, when they can sell cos- 
metics on Mars! They don’t seem 
to give a damn how hard these 
moon hops are on a salesman’s 
nerves.” 

Calkins glowered to himself at 
the memory of the trip just finished. 
“Of course, if I don’t meet ex- 
penses, the company uses the loss 
as a tax write-off, so they don’t give 
a damn about the cost. But I can’t 
take a tax deduction for the strain 
on my nerves.” 

“Too bad,” Jiro said sympathet- 
ically. “Moon hops are rough on 
some people. Me, I loved it. Didn’t 
bother me a bit.” 

“Maybe it’s easier for skinny peo- 
ple,” Calkins answered. “But I’m 
not going to starve myself so I can 
make space hops for my company. 
I’ll take an Earth job first.” Defi- 
ance sounded in his voice. 

“Well, good luck, whichever way 
you go,” Jiro said. Closing the sales 
brochure, he slipped it into his 
brief case, then rose to his feet. “I 
want to check everything out be- 
fore we stop. See you later, Cal- 
kins.” 

Nodding to the other passengers 
and smiling, Jiro made his way 
along the aisle and entered the 
washroom in the front of the car. 
Inside, he closed and locked the 
door.

O nce the door was looked, a star- 
tling change came over his 
face. Instantly it lost its salesman’s 
expression of pleasant agreeable- 
ness, of sauve urbanity, of easy-go- 
ing tolerance and became the face 
of a man in stark terror. His cheeks 
were already thin. Now they showed 
signs of becoming almost haggard. 
His eyes had been smiling. They 
lost ail traces of the smile they had 
worn, and the pupils began to widen. 

Reaching quickly into an inner 
jacket pocket, he touched the strange 
little gun bolstered there. His fin- 
gers went on from the gun to a 
small metal flask. Pulling it from 
under his jacket, he pressed a but- 
ton on its top. The resultant spray 
he directed to the surface of the 
metal mirror over the washbasin. 
As the spray struck the mirror, it 
tunned a deep blue color which 
merged into and finally became a 
deep indigo hue. 

Losing its ability to reflect light, 
to function in the range of the visi- 
ble spectrum, the mirror seemed to 
reach out into some dimension, in- 
to some other universe, perhaps in- 
to some other frequency range and 
to become an indigo pool that 
looked a little like a hole into an- 
other world. 

Jiro could no longer see his face 
in the mirror, but he studied the in- 
digo pool that looked a little like a 
hole into another universe as if he 
was desperately afraid of what he 
might see there. 

When he realized that nothing 
was visible in the pool of indigo, 
he took a deep breath and sighed 
in relief. 



“Whew!” he whispered. “Well, 
that helps!” 

As he spoke, the indigo dye had 
already begun to fade. Quickly the 
metal became a mirror once more. 
Now it reflected his face again, 
lean and gaunt and wary. 

Washing his face and hands, Jiro 
made his hair neat. When he left 
the washroom, he was whistling 
cheerfully, an air from the current 
hit, The Pink Mill . 

Calkins, the cosmetics salesman, 
was waiting outside the washroom. 

“You’re next,” Jiro said, pleasant- 
ly. His voice was again that of a 
salesman, suave, friendly and ur- 
bane. 

“I found everything in order in 
there,” he nodded toward the wash- 
room. “I left it the same way.” 

“I’ll do the same,” Calkins said. 
He looked relieved. 

Moving along the aisle, Jiro heard 
the washroom door snap shut be- 
hind Calkins. He moved to his seat. 

N ow nearing the Salt Lake City 
terminal, the train was rapidly 
losing its 120 mile per hour speed. 
Through the windows, Jiro caught 
glimpses of desert country giving 
way to patches of cultivated land. 
Then tracts of small homes were 
flashing past, and in the distance 
the towers of the city seemed to be 
rising out of the land like miracles 
created by some fantastic genii 
transplanted from Arabia to the 
New World. 

Picking up his bag, Jiro moved 
to the front and waited for the 
train to stop. All of the passengers 
had come in on tihe same moon-

rocket. Most looked as if they were 
very glad to be back on Earth again. 
Only when a man had been to the 
moon could he fully appreciate his 
home planet. Up there, gravity was 
different, radiations from space were 
different and life itself was differ- 
ent. On the moon, human life ex- 
isted only in plastiskin domes or in 
underground shelters. The kind of 
life that existed outside the domes, 
whether native to the moon or com- 
ing from elsewhere, no one knew 
much about. 

Those in the know on Earth, high 
government officials, some few sci- 
entists and those who job it was to 
make friends with this life or to de- 
stroy it, knew that life existed on 
the moon. 

They did not talk about what they 
knew. 

The monorail train slid to a halt 
beside an elevated station. Jiro, sud- 
denly very polite, made way for the 
other passengers to go ahead of him. 
When he reached the door of the 
washroom, he was last in line. Hes- 
itating there, he rapped softly on 
the door. 

There was no answer. 

“Calkins, we’re at the station,” 
he called. 

Still there was no answer. Try- 
ing the knob, he found the door 
was locked -from the inside. Leaning 
against the door, he pushed hard. 
The dock gave way. The door open- 
ed inward. 

Calkins was sitting against the 
far wall. He had fallen there. His 
head drooped to one side. Blood 
was still dripping from the ends of 
the black mustache down to the 



floor, where it was forming a red 
pool. 

The salesman’s throat had been 
slashed from ear to ear by an in- 
strument sharp enough to cut 
through muscles, through cartilege 
and through arteries. 

Jiro took one look at the body. 

“Oh, pardon me,” he said. “I 
thought the room was empty.” His 
manner was that of a man apologiz- 
ing for intruding on another man 
in the privacy of the toilet. 

Backing out of the washroom, 
Jiro closed the door, then went 
quickly out of the car and down 
the steps to the station platform. 
By the time he reached the bottom 
steps, sweat had formed on his face. 
A porter was waiting there, to help 
those in need of assistance. Waving 
aside the help, Jiro smiled at the 
porter and said it was hot out here 
in the desert. As the porter was po- 
litely agreeing, Jiro moved toward 
the bank of escalators that led down- 
ward to the concourse of the mono- 
rail station. A young woman dressed 
in skintight slacks — a fashion 
that came again every few years — 
walked ahead of him. She had a 
tiny radio glued to her ear and 
seemed to be engrossed in what she 
was hearing. Having other things on 
his mind, Jim Jiro hardly noticed 
the young woman. 

B ag in one hand, briefcase in the 
other, he took the down es- 
calator. Sweat was flowing freely 
from his face now. He turned to 
look behind him, saw nothing, look- 
ed down the escalator, turned to 
look behind again, looked down 



28 



IF 




the escalator and was starting to 
turn again to look behind when he 
realized what he was doing. 

“Do you want to drop down dead 
right here, Jim Jiro?” he said, 
fiercely but silently, to himself. “If 
you don’t want to drop down 
dead, start acting like a salesman 
who has just arrived in this sta- 
tion and who has nothing more 
important on his mind than a call 
to his sales manager.” 

He put a smile on his face. It 
was an effort, but he made his 
face obey his mental orders to 
smile. He forced his lips to whis- 
tle. He forced his eyes to regard 
approvingly the bottom of the 
young woman in the skintight 
slacks. Smiling, he walked direct- 
ly to a row of coin-operated stor- 
age lockers. Unlocked now, the 
receptacles needed only the inser- 
tion of a coin in a slot to become 
effective for safe storage. Jiro’s 
bag went into one locker, the 
brief case went into a second and, 
in a slight of hand movement so 
deftly done that only a keen eye 
could have detected it, the little case 
that contained the black diamonds 
went into a third locker. 

Signs on »the lockers said: Fifty 
Cents for twelve hours. Contents 
of Lockers will be removed to 
Lost and Found Department when 
paid time has expired. 

Jiro’s hand went into his pocket 
for coins. It came out with a scat- 
tering of dimes and one lone quar- 
ter but with no half dollars. 

He remember a change booth 
now out of sight at the bottom of 
the escalator. Deftly, he slapped 



imaginary coins in each locker, then 
went quickly to the change booth. 
The young woman in the skintight 
slacks was getting change too, with 
the radio still in her ear. Ignoring 
her, Jiro changed a bill. Returning 
to the bank of lockers, he slipped 
six half dollars in each of the three 
lockers, paying up for. 72 hours, 
then removed the keys. 

His expression was that of a man 
who had gotten a load off his mind. 
Turning, he strode straight to the 
automatic vendor of stamped en- 
velopes. 

Sweat was on his face. He let it 
stay there. 

“If you can stay alive for the 
next five minutes, maybe you can 
make it until tomorrow,” he said 
to himself. 

From the automatic vending ma- 
chine, he got what appeared to be 
one sheet of stamped paper, gum- 
med so that it could be folded into 
an envelope with a message writ- 
ten on the inside of the paper. 
Only a watchful eye could have 
discerned that two coins had actual- 
ly gone into the machine and that 
it had spat out two stamped sheets 
of paper. 

At the writing table, he scrib- 
bled a hasty note which was ad- 
dressed to Sales Manager, Allied 
Cutting Tool Company, New York, 
N. Y., folded the sheet of paper, 
made a mess of the fold and had to 
do it a second time; then, after this 
was finished, he seemed suddenly to 
remember that he had forgotten a 
return address. Correcting this de- 
ficiency, he went to the mail slot, 
where he dropped the envelope. 



PEACE CORPS 



29 




Checking the collection time, he saw 
that it was only five minutes away. 

Only a keen eye could have de- 
tected that two envelopes had gone 
into the slot and tihait the second en- 
velope contained the key to the 
locker which held the three black 
diamonds. 

A s if he had mailed a sales report 
which contained huge orders, 
Jiro put a happy smile on his face 
and turned toward the visaphone 
booths. The expression on his face 
was that of a man about to turn 
from business to pleasure. There 
were dozens of visaphone booths, 
all in a row. He selected the one in 
the middle. It had solid walls on 
three sides. The only glass in it 
was in the door. 

It was a pay visaphone, with a 
four-inch square glass tube that 
would light up to show the person 
at the other end of the connection. 
Pushing a coin into a slot, he got 
an operator and told her he wanted 
to make a collect long-distance call, 
giving her the number he wanted. 
“Right away, sir,” she told him. 
While he was waiting for the con- 
nection, he seemed suddenly to rec- 
ollect that his image would be seen 
by the person to whom he would 
be talking. As if he wished to make 
the best possible impression on that 
person, he reached hastily into, his 
inside jacket pocket for the little 
atomizer. He sprayed his face with 
this. Carelessly, he also sprayed the 
glass front of the telephone picture 
tube. 

The glass turned an indigo blue. 
As if his life depended on what 



he saw in the indigo pool — or on 
what he did not see — Jiro studied 
the blue hole that seemed to look 
out onto another universe. 

Nothing moved there. Or nothing 
that he could see. As he realized 
the blue pool was a blue pool and 
was nothing else, he let out his 
breath in a sigh of pure relief. 

“Yes,” a deep bass voice said 
from the visaphone speaker. 

“I’m home, boss,” Jiro said. 
“Jim!” The deep boss voice rang 
like a happy bell shouting with 
good news of the return of a prodi- 
gal, then caught its happiness. 
“Are — ” 

“I’m all right, I think,” Jiro said. 
“Good! I was plenty worried.” The 
bell rang with happiness and with 
relief. “Is it all rigjht to talk?” 

“I think so. I sprayed the blue 
dye on the picture tube. The phone 
booth is clean. But the washroom 
was clean too, I thought, before 
Calkins went in — 

“What?” the bass voice lost all of 
its recent happiness. “Where is Cal- 
kins?” 

“He’s dead,” Jiro said. “His body 
is in the washroom of the middle 
car of the monorail train that 
brought us in from the space port, 
unless it has been found and re- 
moved.” 

“I’ll take care of it,” the bass 
voice said. “What happened.” 

Jiro explained. “Either the dye 
didn’t work, or something followed 
him into the washroom.” 

“Uh! Were you followed?” 

“If so, I don’t know it,” Jiro 
said. He waited for the bass voice 
to continue. 



30 



IF 




The voice was silent. The indigo 
blue was fading from the picture 
tube. As the dye faded, the round, 
ruddy face of a completely bald 
man appeared on the little screen. 
The face had hot gray eyes. For an 
instant, as the baldheaded man 
faced the fact of death to someone 
under his command, the hot eyes 
were very sad. 

The sad eyes looked at Jiro. “You 
couldn’t make friends with them, 
eh?” the bass voice asked. 

“No, sir,” Jiro said. “I couldn’t 
even set up communications with 
them.” 

T he bald-headed man nodded. 
“All right, then it’s war,” he 

said. 

As he was speaking, his voice 
was picking up the throat-rumbling 
growl of the Great Dane, a rum- 
bling, rolling, roaring sound that 
came up from his middle regions 
and promised to utterly destroy any 
enemy it faced. “We tried for peace 
and we failed. And I’ve got a dead 
man in the washroom of a mono- 
rail train. Tell me what happened?” 
“I don’t know what happened,” 
Jiro said. “I think we were followed 
from the moon. I think they came 
right along with us in the same 
ship. I think when we boarded the 
monorail train, they got on board 
with us — ” 

“How many — ” 

“How would I know?” Jiro an- 
swered. “I don’t have a dear im- 
pression of their size, I don’t even 
know if they can be measured in 
terms of feet and inches, in meters 
and in millimeters.” 



“Jim!” 

“Size is relative,” Jiro answered. 
“I brought three things that look 
like black diamonds with me. 
They’re in a locker in the station 
here. I mailed the key to myself, 
general delivery, main post office, 
Salt Lake City. Have one of <5ur 
local men pick up the key and get 
these things out of that lodker, fast. 
I want them put into an incubator.” 

“What?” the baldheaded man 
shouted. 

“I think they’re eggs, and I want 
to find out if they will hatch,” Jiro 
said. 

“Jim — ” the rumbling voice was 
suddenly soft. 

“I’m in what is left of my right 
mind. I think those black diamonds 
are eggs and I want them put into 
an incubator and I want them 
watched day and night, and if they 
hatch — I know this sounds silly, 
but play it my way.” 

“All right, all right, all right,” 
the bald-headed man agreed. “Now 
I’ve got a job I want you to take 
over. I want you to get lost in Salt 
Lake City. I want you to stay lost 
until you are sure you are not be- 
ing followed. Then I want you to 
take a jet to Chicago and get lost 
again. When you are sure you are 
not being followed, you may either 
report to me via phone or you may 
come on here to Denver and report 
to me in person. Got it, Jim?” 

“Yes, Mr. Urban,” Jiro said. 

“Get lost, Jim. Stay lost. And 
Jim — ” The voice of the Great 
Dane caught again. 

“Yes, sir,” Jiro said. 

“Stay alive, Jim. You’re the best 



PEACE CORPS 



31 




man this section ever had. We need 
you, Jim, we need you.” 

“You don’t need me any more 
than I need to stay alive,” Jiro an- 
swered. 

“Out, Jim,” Urban said. 

In front of Jiro’s eyes, the face 
of the bald-headed man faded from 
the little screen. 

Tiro went out of the passenger ter- 
" minal to the helicopter taxi 
landing area. A whirlybird lifted 
him to the top of the newest de- 
partment store. Going downstairs, 
he entered the men’s room and 
tested the mirror there. 

The glass stayed a pool of in- 
digo. 

Leaving the department store, he 
took a street-level taxi to the jet 
port. Testing the mirror here, he 
found it revealed nothing. 

“If I’m being followed, it’s stay- 
ing out of sight,” he thought. 

There was little comfort in the 
thought. If the creature that had 
killed Calkins was following him, 
it could very well remain hidden in 
invisibility. 

Using his credit card, he bought 
a ticket to Chicago. The big, fast 
jet had hardly jumped off the 
ground before he went to the men’s 
room. Again the mirror revealed 
nothing. 

For the first time, he felt a little 
safe. ^ Not really safe, not perma- 
nently safe, not safe enough to 
trust himself in deep sleep, but safe 
enough to trust himself to nap with 
one eye open. 

Not that having one eye open 
would save his life, if something 



as sharp as the edge of a razor 
wanted to cut his throat, but hav- 
ing an eye open did make him feel 
a little better. 

When the big jet touched down at 
the Chicago airport, he was still 
alive. 

II 

I n the washroom of the Chicago 
airport, Jiro again sprayed a 
mirror with the indigo dye. The pool 
that opened into another universe 
revealed nothing. Feeling really safe 
at last, he went into a restaurant 
and ate. The rocket had landed at 
dawn; it was now midafternoon. 
Most of the fatigue had gone out of 
him. Sitting in the restaurant over 
black coffee, he suddenly realized 
how good it was to be back on the 
Home Planet. 

The moon was a weird place, a 
haunted land of shadows as black 
as midnight in one place and, a 
hundred yards away, of sunlight 
blazing brighter and hotter than that 
of the African Sahara. The eye of 
a human did not like this violent 
contrast of shadow and of light. 
The moon was Earth’s nearest 
neighbor in space, but in spite of its 
nearness, it was an alien world. 

And a horrible one. 

But the ores were there, the rich 
ores, the fine ores. The deep cra- 
ters were natural shafts leading 
downward to the rich veins of 
mineral wealth. Metal-hungry Earth 
needed those ores. Founded on iron, 
civilization still existed on steel, 
though all the other metals were 
needed. Without them in plentiful 



32 



IF 




supply, the Home Planet would be- 
gin to decay. 

Military-minded Earth, the poli- 
ticians, the rock- jawed admirals of 
the space fleet under the control of 
World Governments, was and al- 
ways had been interested in military 
control of the moon, which was* a 
perfect launching platform for rock- 
ets aimed at any nation on the 
Home World. As a result of a 
truce among the great powers, the 
battle for military control of the 
moon was in abeyance at the mo- 
ment. 

Politically-minded Earth needed 
the vast publicity of moon ex- 
ploration and development as a help 
in the always-coming next election. 
Scientifically-minded Earth needed 
moon exploration to keep the subsi- 
dies and the grants coming from the 
various governments. 

All of these were pressures forc- 
ing exploration and development of 
the satellite. But there was another 
pressure. Intangible and subtle, it 
was nevertheless very real and very 
strong. It expressed itself in the idea 
that the humjan race was going some- 
where. Exactly where the race was 
going, no one knew for sure. One 
point was clear fo everybody — the 
moon was not the end. No! It was 
only a steppingstone into the solar 
system. 

And after the solar system, the 
stars would stretch on forever to 
lure men toward them. 

I f other forms of life were en- 
countered — and this was cer- 
tain to happen — the plan of World 
Governments was to make friends 



with it, if this was possible. If it was 
not possible, then the rock- jawed 
admirals of the space fleet had spe- 
cific instructions to use such war- 
heads and such laser beams as might 
be necessary in their judgment to 
facilitate the outward-flowing wave 
of human exploration. 

At least one — possibly other — 
form of life had once existed on 
the moon. The scientists were sure 
of the evidence for this, said evi- 
dence being in the form of vast nets 
that looked a little like webs spun 
by strange spiders in some of the 
craters of the satellite. The 
creatures that had spun these 
slowly vanished from sight. Perhaps 
they had gone into hibernation in 
caverns beneath the moon’s surface. 
Perhaps they had died and had dis- 
appeared. The webs were falling in- 
to ruin now, and the creatures that 
had spun them in the almost airless 
craters were gone. 

At least this was what the public 
thought, what the public had been 
told, perhaps what the public wished 
to believe. Thinking how much 
more there was to the story, remem- 
bering how blood had dripped from 
the ends of Calkins’ long mustache, 
Jim Jiro suddenly lost his appetite. 
Getting to his feet, he paid the tab. 
Perhaps a walk through the throng- 
ed concourse of the airport would 
clear the feeling of horror from his 
mind. 

Just as the feeling of horror was 
dissolving, he discovered he was be- 
ing followed. Instantly, a charge of 
adrenalin was squirted into the 
bloodstream by the suspicious sub- 
conscious mind. Then, as he real- 



PEACE CORPS 



33 




ized that what was following him 
was human, the subconscious mind 
cut the switches it had closed. How- 
ever, adrenalin had already gone in- 
to the bloodstream, and Jiro had 
to fight the impulse to flee from 
this danger his subconscious mind 
had discovered. 

The danger was only a mild, in- 
offensive-appearing little man who 
had a face vaguely like that of a 
mole. Wearing a hearing aid hidden 
in steel-rimmed spectacles, Mole- 
face appeared to be studying a rac- 
ing form as he made his way 
through the crowds. Only occasion- 
al glances over his steel-rimmed 
spectacles revealed his interest in 
the slender man. 

One glance at Mole-face told Jiro 
that he could handle him physically, 
if this became necessary. The man 
himself was not disturbing. The fact 
of his presence was. 

Since he must have been waiting 
at the airport for Jiro’s arrival, this 
could only mean that he had known 
Jiro was coming. This in its turn 
could only mean that somebody had 
known when Jiro left Salt Lake 
City and where he had been going. 

A s he realized the meaning of the 
shadow’s presence Jiro began 
to look at the empty air around 
him. His manner was that of a 
man who suspects the existence 
of invisible demons. He turned 
quickly to look behind him, 
then turned again, then realized 
what he was doing. Instantly, he 
caught himself and resumed his 
stroll. 

As he turned, something struck 



him from in front. He had the 
vague impression that he had run 
into an elephant. Then he realized 
that the elephant was actually a 
huge fat woman carrying a net 
shopping bag in one hand and an 
umbrella in the other. 

“Sorry, madam,” Jiro said. 

Eyes the size and color of those 
of a small pig glared at him from 
a puffy face. 

“Why didn’t you watch where 
you were going?” she shouted at 
him. 

“I said I was sorry — ” 

“Being sorry ain’t enough, you 
fool!” Lifting the umbrella, she 
bopped him over the head with it. 

Jiro’s hand was on the weapon 
inside his coat before he realized 
what he was about to do. He took 
his hand away from the gun. 

“I almost acted before I thought,” 
he said. 

“You damned fool — ” the fat 
woman began. 

“Let’s hope you are never again 
so close to death,” Jiro said. 

As she caught his meaning, her 
face turned gray. “Mister — ” Caught 
between fear and anger, she could 
only stutter. 

“Get lost!” Jiro said. 

Turning quickly, she waddled 
away. As the crowd dosed around 
her, she was running. 

Jiro felt his head where the um- 
brella had struck. Coming when it 
had, the blow had startled him, but 
it had done no physical damage. He 
turned to look for Mole-face. 

The little , man wearing the hear- 
ing aid in the steel spectacles had 
disappeared in the crowd. 



34 



IF 




Jiro liked his absence even less 
than his presence. As long as Mole- 
face was around, he was a known 
shadow. When he disappeared, this 
meant that another — and unknown 
— shadow had probably taken his 
place. 

Skinny Jim Jiro wasted no time 
looking for the second shadow. His 
orders had been to lose himself. So 
far, he had failed to obey them. 
This was an error which had to be 
corrected, immediately. 

G oing to the helicopter landing 
area, Jiro boarded a waiting 
whirly-bird. “The Loop!’ he shouted 
to the pilot. 

“Right away, sir,” the pilot an- 
swered. 

If somebody picked up the num- 
ber of the sky-cab and phoned it 
ahead, there was no better place on 
Earth to lose a shadow than in the 
thronging thousands of Chicago’s 
old midtown Loop section. 

The helicopter set Jiro down on 
a landing area at sidewalk level. 
He went through gates that barred 
the public from the area and kept 
the stupid and the curious from 
getting their heads chopped off by 
spinning vanes. Ignoring the shouts 
of warning from the security man, 
Jiro merged into the throng on 
the moving sidewalk. Riding for 
half a block, he stepped from the 
moving walk to the ordinary con- 
crete sidewalk. After walking an- 
other block, he entered a depart- 
ment store. Going through it, he 
hailed a steam-powered street level 
taxicab, gave the driver an address 
on the near North Side and was 



whisked up the north bound ramp 
of the expressway. 

So far as he could tell, he was 
not being followed. No other cab 
had come into the pattern behind 
him, but before he reached the 
North Side, he changed his destina- 
tion. ' 

In response, the cab left the ex- 
pressway and diveSd headlong into 
an area of old homes that had once 
been mansions in some wonderful 
world of the past. While the stately 
old homes still managed to hold 
their own against the encroaching 
high-rise apartment buildings that 
surrounded them, they had not been 
able to maintain their original aris- 
tocratic manner. 

Once, the intrusion of a man like 
Jim Jiro into one of these homes 
would have been sufficient reason 
to summon the police. 

Now he could walk into any of 
them he pleased and could stay 
as long as he could pay the rent. 

The wonderful world of the past 
had changed, and the stately old 
homes had become rooming houses. 

A t random, Jiro selected a huge 
old house with a sign ROOM 
FOR RENT in the window. 

Paying off his taxicab driver, he 
went inside, where a hatchet-faced 
landlady with greedy eyes stared 
suspiciously at him. 

“Ye’ll have to pay in advance, 
mister,” she told him. 

“That’s all right,” Jiro said. 
“Show me a room. Good but in- 
expensive.” 

She sniffed at his requirements. 
He followed her along a creak- 



PEACE CORPS 



35 




ing 'hallway to a room at the rear 
that overlooked a ibacklot and an 
alley and a garage where kids were 
playing noisily. 

Jiro said he liked the view, which 
made the landlady more suspicious 
than ever; but what he really liked 
was the creaking hallway, though he 
did not mention this. 

“Ill take it,” he said. 

The price, which had not as yet 
been stated, jumped fifty per cent 
at these words. Jiro didn’t care about 
the price. In the long run, World 
Gorveraments was paying for the 
room, a fact which he did not men- 
tion either. 

“The bathroom is down the hall. 
Yell find towels in the closet,” the 
landlady told him. Jiro listened to 
the boards creak as she went down 
the hall. 

Going into the bathroom, he 
sprayed the cracked (mirror that he 
found there with the little atomizer 
which he carried in an inside poc- 
ket. Again he stared into the indigo 
pool. Theory said that if any in- 
visible thing was present in the bath- 
room, the indigo dye sprayed over 
the mirror would reveal its reflec- 
tion. 

After what had happened to Cal- 
kins, Jiro was not sure that this 
theory was any good, but it was the 
best the boys in the laboratories had 
been able to do so far. Perhaps in 
the future — if there was a future 
— they would be able to do better. 

Studied from every angle, the in- 
digo pool that seemed to open out 
into another universe revealed 
nothing. There were no suspicious 
light swirls, no face that looked 



like a cross between a bird and a 
spider, no points of ice-picks, no 
lines of light trying to become raz- 
or edges. Slowly, the dye faded. 

“Negative again,” Jim Jiro 
thought. “What if the spray had 
lost its strength — ” 

He put the thought out of his 
mind. A man in his position who 
started thinking about the what ifs 
was taking a short cut to the mad- 
house. He was also following the 
pattern of men who had feared the 
unknown since the time when the 
race was young. What if a tiger 
lurked beside the waterhole today? 
What if a devil wearing green came 
out of a mound and devoured all 
of us? What if a tire blew when 
you were doing ninety on the free- 
way? 

Man had a heritage of what ifs 
gleaned from centuries of bitter ex- 
perience. Jim Jiro knew better than 
to let the anxieties of these cen- 
turies come up like screaming ghosts 
from his subconscious mind. Going 
back to the bedroom along the 
creaky hall, he locked the door and 
laid down on the bed. 

S houts of the children at play 
came from the back yard. With 
a quarter of his mind, Jim Jiro lis- 
tened to their happy noise. What if 
a horde of invisible devils came 
from the moon? If this happened, 
would kids continue to play in the 
backyards of America? 

Jim Jiro did not know the an- 
swer to this question. He did not 
even like to think about it. 

Sliding the little gun out of its 
holster, he checked to make cer-

IF 




tain it was in working order. Odd- 
ly shaped, an inexperienced obser- 
ver. would have had difficulty in 
deciding that it was actually a weap- 
on. 

It had three barrels. No barrel 
was over an inch long. The bar- 
rel on the left would emit a spurt 
of gas which would render a human 
helpless in a matter of seconds 
and would make him unconscious 
in less than a minute. The barrel 
on the right was the size of a pin. 
It fired a needle which was coated 
with a fast-acting anaesthetic. The 
needle was effective at a greater 
distance than the gas. 

The third barrel was under the 
other two. It fired a tiny pointed 
slug which looked like a flattened 
pea. Only two slugs were kept in 
the little weapon, one in the cham- 
ber ready to be fired, and one in a 
magazine in reserve. 

If it reached its target, one slug 
was all that was needed. The pea- 
sized pellets exploded with such 
violence that one would blow off 
a mans head. If a slug struck his 
heart, this organ would be blown 
out of the rib cage. If it struck his 
intestinal tract, no surgeon would 
ever succeed in putting him back 
together ^gain. 

Yet in spite of its versatility and 
power, the whole weapon was so 
small it could fit into the palm of 
a man’s hand. 

These weapons were WGI 

World Governments Issue — to men 
who served this organization in the 
grim unit euphemistically called The 
Peace Corps. 

Looking at the powerful little 



weapon, Jiro felt like throwing it 
out of the window. It hadn’t saved 
Calkin’s life. But Calkins had not 
had a chance to use it. Or had he? 
Exactly what had happened in that 
looked washroom? Had something 
followed Calkins into the room or 
had it been there waiting? If it had 
been waiting there, why had" it at- 
tacked Calkins instead of Jim Jiro, 
Jim Jiro shrugged such questions 
out of his mind. He had no way to 
answer them. Outside, the children 
had stopped yelling happily and had 
begun to scream in anger. Rising, 
Jiro slipped the little weapon back 
into its holster. Going to the window, 
he looked out. 

A car had come into the back 
yard and had stopped in the 
middle of what the children had 
thought was a baseball diamond. A 
limousine, sleek and powerful, the 
car had been built to hold eight pas- 
sengers. It was a steam job, one of 
those marvelously improved steam 
turbine powered cars that now were 
the rage. 

The driver of the limousine was a 
round-faced youth with the newest 
in haircut styles. Bland and smil- 
ing, he was probably considered by 
his associates to be a cool cat. Just 
looking at the driver, Jiro detested 
him. Was it for the kids like this that 
he risked his life? As Jiro was 
thinking about this problem, his gaze 
went on the man sitting beside the 
driver. 

The man was Mole-face! This was 
a man he had seen at the airport! 

In spite of every precaution Jiro 
had taken, he knew he had been fol-

lowed through the thronging Loop 
district to this shabby rooming house 
on the north side of Chicago. 

How had this been done? 

He did not know . 

The kids had fled into the gar- 
age when the car had appeared. 
Coming out again, they were now 
jeering at the occupants of the car, 
inviting them to get the limousine 
off of their baseball diamond. 

“Get lost!” the driver shouted at 

them. 

They fled back to the garage, 

then, from the doorway, began to 
shout again. There were perhaps fif- 
teen of them, ranging in ages from 
nine or ten down to a toddler who 
was hardly out of training pants. 

The toddler was at an age level 
where verbal taunts do not com- 
pletely satisfy. Imitating his older 
companions, he was shouting at 
the occupants of the car, but was 
being ignored. To make certain they 
noticed him, he picked up a piece 
of broken brick and threw it at the 
car. It struck the windshield and 
caused a slight scratch in the shat- 
ter-proof glass. 

Mole-face opened the door on his 
side. Leaning out, he tossed some- 
thing over the top of the car. It 
sailed in an arc toward the open 
door of the garage. 

The kids scattered from it. The 
toddler tried to run but slipped 
and " fell. The object Mole-face had 
thrown struok in the open door of 
the garage and directly in front of 
the toddler. It exploded softly. A 
green mist puffed from it. The mist 
struck the toddler as he got to his 
feet, enguilfing him. 



The toddler fell a second time. For 
an instant, he seemed to have for- 
gotten how to get to his feet. As 
if he were trying to swim on the 
concrete slab, his arms and legs 
thrashed wildly. Then this motion 
ceased. He seemed to sigh and to 
stretch out. As the green mist went 
into his lungs, it was as if he’d got- 
ten tired and had decided to lie 
down and take a little nap. 

It was a nap that would never 
end. 

The green mist flowed into the 
garage where the kids had fled. Si- 
lence followed it. 

The kids in there were also tak- 
ing little naps. 

J iro did not know how the gun 
got into his hand. It seemed to 
appear there as if by magic. Never 
in his life had he wanted to kill 
anybody as badly as he wanted to 
kill the man who had tossed the 
small but very deadly gas bomb 
over the top of the car and into the 
door of the garage. He did not in 
the least doubt that the bland-faced 
youth sitting behind the wheel de- 
served the same as his companion. 
The bottom barrel of the little 
weapon would do the job. Probably 
the windshield of the big limousine 
was made of bullet-proof glass, but 
one of the pellets from the bottom 
barrel would knock the windshield 
out of the car and would shatter the 
vehicle and its occupants. 

Jiro did not fire the shot. Killing 
the two occupants of the car would 
not bring the toddler back to life 
nor would it lift the pail of silence 
that hung over the garage.

IF 




At this moment, Jiro told himself, 
his job was not vengeance — this 
would have to wait for another 
time, perhaps for other hands — his 
job was to stay alive 'long enough to 
report what he had seen happen here, 
to say that another and hitherto un- 
known gang of human killers seem- 
ed to have made an alliance with the 
death that was coming from the 
moon. 

Perhaps Urban already knew this, 
perhaps he did not. 

Slipping the little weapon back 
into its holster, Jiro turned to the 
door and jerked it open. 

The fat woman who had hit him 
over the head with her umbrella was 
standing on the other side of the 
door. While he had been engrossed 
in watching the horror in the back 
yard, she had come along the creak- 
ing hallway without him noticing the 
noise she was making. Her little pig 
eyes glared at him from the puffy 
skin of her greasy face. In her hand, 
she held something that looked like 
a nasal spray. 

As he opened the door, mist from 
the nasal spray was already spurt- 
ing upward. It puffed around his 
face, stinging the skin tissues there, 
a pink mist that went into his lungs. 
Before he 'had time to get the gun 
into his hand again, he was falling. 

As he fell, he recognized the fat 
woman. 

Her name was Nellie Moll. 

She was the leader of the most 
vicious, depraved, violent gang of 
wanted criminals that ever existed. 
She ruled this gang by being the most 
vicious, depraved, and violent mem- 
ber of all. 



HI 

J iro slowly realized he was hear- 
ing a voice, which was calling 
him sweet names, was telling him 
what a nice boy he was, and was 
asking him a question. 

“Where are they, baby?” the voice 
asked him, over and over again/ “Be 
a nice boy and tell mama where 
they are, sweetheart.” 

Jiro thought his throat and his 
lungs were on fire. Remembering 
what had happened to the toddler 
when the green gas had hit the 
child, he decided he was lucky to be 
alive at all. He knew his eyes were 
open, but he also knew he was not 
seeing out of them. The gas had 
blocked off his optic nerve some- 
where, and his vision was cut off. 
In one way, he rather suspected 
this was a blessing. He did not 
think he would like what he would 
be seeing if he could see. 

Certainly he did not like what 
he was hearing. Usually the words 
“baby” and “sweetheart” were used 
in a tender situation, as part of the 
love act. They were not being used 
that way now. As he was hearing 
them, they sounded as if they had 
been soaked in vinegar and then dis- 
solved in hydrochloric acid. Venom, 
bitterness and hate oozed from each 
word. 

Abruptly, the blockage was dis- 
solved from his optic nerve, and 
he could see again. He saw instant- 
ly that he had been right in think- 
ing he would not like what he would 
see. Nellie Moll was bending over 
him. As she realized he was con- 
scious, she smile fondly at him

and sat down in a chair beside the 
bed where he was lying. 

“Nice, nice,” she said. “Mama is 
so glad to see you have come back 
to life.” 

She was smoking a small cigar 
with an ivory tip. A heavy net bag 
was in her lap. The room was 
poorly lighted, and his vision was 
not good, but Jiro could make out, 
dimly, in the background, the sharp 
nose of Mole-face and the square 
shoulders of Hair-cut, who had been 
driving the limousine that had 
stopped the ball game of the kids, 
permanently. Did they think they 
could get away with that kind of 
murder? 

On second thought, Jiro could see 
why they might think they could get 
away with it. The killing was un- 
motivated and, except for him, un- 
witnessed. As he realized he was 
probably the only witness of this 
wanton murder, Jiro decided that 
he would not mention it. 

Not that he thought that he had 
much chance off getting out of this 
basement alive, anyhow. 

He was lying on his back on a 
bed. Pain was in his wrists, in both 
shoulders and in his ankles. He 
tried to roll over, to relieve the pain, 
and discovered that he was lying 
with his hands tied together above 
his head. They were then tied to the 
head of the bed. His ankles were also 
tied together and to the foot of 
the bed. 

Wire had been used to tie him. 
It was cutting into his skin. 

H e tried to speak. The effort 
brought on a violent spasm of 



coughing. His throat was burning. 
The cough seemed to make it worse. 

“Water,” he whispered. 

The fat woman beamed fondly at 
him. A baby speaking its first word 
would not have received greater en- 
couragement from its doting mother 
than he did from Nellie Moll at this 
moment. Her little pig eyes radiated 
pleasure. 

“My boys wants water,” she said 
to Mole-face and Hair-cut. 

“Do you want I should get him 
a drink, Miss Nell?” Mole-face 
asked. 

“Please do,” she said, gently. 

Mole-face went to a washbasin 
on the far side of the room. The 
sound of splashing water followed. 
Jim Jiro thought he had never heard 
a more pleasant sound in his life. 
Mole-face returned with a paper 
cup with bright drops of water roll- 
ing down its side. 

Nellie Moll took the cup away 
from Mole-face. 

“Do you want a drink, sweet- 
heart?” she cooed to Jiro. 

Skinny Jim Jiro had never want- 
ed anything as much as he wanted 
this drink of water. Nellie Moll 
leaned over and moved the cup to- 
ward his face. He lifted his head as 
much as he could. 

She threw the water in his face. 

He sank back on the bed. 

“You’ll get a drink when you 
talk!” she screamed. 

If he could have gotten his hands 
on her, he would have gladly chok- 
ed her to death. Drops of the water 
were still on his lips, and he reached 
out his tongue trying his 'best to lick 
them off.

IF 




S he thrust the lighted end of the 
cigar on his tongue. 

He heard the hiss of burning coal 
on flesh as red-hot pain shot 
through his tongue. She put the 
cigar back into her mouth, puffed 
it until the end was again a glow- 
ing coal and stood beaming fondly 
at him. Gagging and choking, he 
made up his mind that he would 
kill this fat woman some day. 

“Get him another drink of water, 
please,” he heard her say. 

Mole-face obeyed. Taking the cup 
of water, Nellie Moll offered it to 
Jiro, who refused to open his mouth. 
At her orders, Hair-cut came around 
the bed and drove his thumbs into 
the corners of Jim’s jaws. Jiro was 
forced to open his mouth. Mole- 
face lifted his head. 

As gently as a nurse giving nour- 
ishment to a bed-ridden hospital pa- 
tient Nellie Moll gave Jiro a drink. 
This made the burned spot on his 
tongue hurt even worse than ever. 

“See how nice I can be, baby,” 
Nellie Moll said, beaming at him 
from her little pig eyes. 

“I’ll remember how nice you have 
been, when I meet you in hell,” 
Jiro said. 

Even though his words were poor- 
ly pronounced, Nellie Moll under- 
stood his meaning perfectly. 

“Maybe you’ll remember, sweet- 
heart. And maybe you won’t re- 
member anything at all!” She shook 
her head at the meaning of her 
words. “It seems such a shame to 
lose a man right in the prime of his 
life, with a good brain and a good 
future.” She shook her head at 
the prospect she saw unfolding be- 



fore her mind’s eye. “But sometimes 
it can’t be helped.” 

“I suppose you will go into deep 
mourning because of it,” Jiro mut- 
tered. A throbbing sensation had 
been added to the burning feeling in 
his tongue, and he could not talk 
clearly. However, the fire from 
the pink gas he had inhaled had 
gone from his throat and from his 
lungs. More important, his head 
was clearing and physical strength 
was coming back into his body. 
Not enough strength to break the 
wires that bound his wrists and his 
ankles, but enough to face his tor- 
mentors, perhaps enough to face the 
idea that he had to die. 

He had no illusions that he wou'd 
not be killed. This was certain. 
But why was Nellie Moll delaying? 
What did she want to know? 

“Where are they, baby?” she 
asked. 

“Where is what?” Jira answered. 

“Them black things you put into 
the locker in Salt Lake City.” 

J im Jiro did not have to act sur- 
prised. He really was surprised, 
that she knew enough to be able 
to ask this question and at the mean- 
ing back of the question. 

“Aren’t they there?” he answered. 
“That’s where I put them. I don’t 
know what happened after I left — 
I mean — ” 

“No, they were not in the locker,” 
Nellie Moll answered. She smiled 
fondly at him. “I’m glad to see you 
are smart enough not to try to pre- 
tend they were only black diamonds. 
I’m real glad to see this. It makes 
things so much easier.” 



PEACE CORPS 



41 




“I didn’t mean to make anything 
easy,” Jiro said. “It’s just that, well, 
I was so surprised to learn they are 
not in the locker. How do you 
know they aren’t there?” 

“Because we sent somebody to 
look,” Nellie Moll said. “And I’m 
real glad you ore not trying to 
lie to me. It makes things a lot 
easier, for you.” 

“Um,” Jiro said. This had over- 
tones he did not like. “How’d you 
manage to follow me here?” 

She smiled fondly at him. He was 
such a bright child! “I don’t mind 
telling you, sweetheart. Do you 
remember when I bopped you with 
my umbrella?” 

“I’ll never forget it — ” 

“There was a little piece of radio- 
active dust on that umbrella. Some 
of it got wiped off on your hat 
when I hit you.” She chuckled to 
herself over some private joke. 

“So you succeeded in putting 
radioactive dust on my hat, then 
you followed me with a good detec- 
tor,” Jira said. “Yes, that is possi- 
ble. It makes sense.” He nodded to 
himself. 

“No, sweetheart,” she denied. 
“Nothing like that.” 

“Hunh? Then how?” 

She nodded toward the ceiling 
of the room. “George did it. George 

can see radioactivity a awa y ? 

maybe more.” 

“Bh? George? What — ” 

“You haven’t met George yet, 
honey. Not officially, that is. 
George has met you but you haven’t 
met him.” Again she chuckled at 
her own private joke. “You’ll like 
George. Sort of, that is.” 



Her chuckle became a laugh. She 
looked at her two followers, for 
confirmation of her joke. They were 
trying to laugh too. In each case, 
they were failing. 

“Real cute, George is, in some 
ways,” she continued. “Real well 
trained too.” 

“What the hell — ” 

“He may not be real smart in 
all ways but he knows enough to 
stay away from mirrors, ’specially 
when they are turning blue,” Nellie 
Moll continued. 

H er grunting laughter was the 
most horrible sound Jim Jiro 
had ever heard. Furtively, he tried 
to pull at his wrists, to gain a lit- 
tle slack there, knowing that even 
if he got his hands free, it would 
gain him nothing. Then, as an- 
other thought struck his mind, he 
gasped a question. 

“Did George kill Calkins?” 

Nellie Moll showed real interest 
in this question. “Who?” she asked. 

Jiro knew he had revealed too 
much in asking this question. He 
tried to cover up. 

“I — found a man in the wash- 
room of the monorail train that 
brought us from Salt Lake City from 
the moonport in the desert. Since 
you knew about the locker, I thought 
perhaps that George had come in on 
that train. I just caught a glimpse 
of the dead man — ” 

“But you knew his name, baby. 
You call him Calkins.” Alarm 
crossed Nellie Moll’s fat face. “Was 
there more than one of you on 
that moonship?” 

«tr 99 




“And one of you was killed?” 
“Yes,” Jiro said. There was no 
point in denying what she had cor- 
rectly guessed. 

“How was he killed?” 

“His throat was cut.” 

“Then more of them came in 
than I was told about!” There was 
no mistaking her alarm now. It 
made great wrinkles in the fat flesh 
of her face. 

“Baby, if you are lying to me — ” 
Jiro found the fat face less than 
six inches from his nose. He saw 
that her eyes were green and were 
filled now with fear and hatred 
that he had never seen in the eyes 
of any other human. Even when 
she had been young, Nellie Moll 
had not been pretty. At this moment, 
she looked like something dredged 
up from the depths of hell. 

She even had the smell of hell on 
her breath. It was a mixture of 
cheap whiskey, strong tobacco and 
some kind of dope that he could not 
identify. 

“Baby, if you are lying to me, I’ll 
just naturally tear your eyes right 
out of your head with my own 
hands.” To prove what she meant, 
she exhibited her fingernails. They 
were broken and dirty. 

Sweat ,was on Jim Jiro’s face and 
on his body. “I’m not lying,” he 
said. 

Oddly, she seemed to believe 
him. Sitting down again, she thrust 
one fat hand into the depths of the 
net bag that she was carrying. 
Rummaging among its varied con- 
tents, she came out with what look- 
ed like a specially made walkie- 
talkie. From the top of it, she care- 



fully pulled out an aerial about 
the thickness of a human hair and 
no more than a quarter of an inch 
long. Ricking on the transmitter, 
she spoke a single word. 

“George!” 

F rom somewhere near the ceiling, 
bird whistles answered her. At 
this sound, Jim Jiro felt his skin 
begin to crawl all over his body. 
Intuitively, he knew the source of 
these sounds. The whistles were 
like those of no bird that Jiro had 
ever heard, 'but there was a shrill- 
ness about them that was similar 
to the sharp whistling of a bird. At 
one and the same time, they were 
both faint and clear, as if this bird 
were both far and near at the same 
time. As the bird sounds came from 
the tiny speaker on the little com- 
pact radio set, Mole-face and Hair- 
cut showed distinct signs of grow- 
ing uneasiness. 

Nellie Moll showed no such un- 
easiness. Her face revealed that in 
her mind she thought she owned 
this bird that was whistling near 
the ceiling. It took orders from her, 
her face said. Looking up toward 
the ceiling, she whistled into the 
transmitter, then listened to the 
whistles that came back in answer. 
She looked at Jiro. 

“George says that one of his pals 
probably got hungry and made a 
meal off of this fellow you men- 
tioned,” she said to Jiro. “He says 
not to worry about it.” 

She beamed at Jiro as if she sud- 
denly loved him again. 

“I was afraid somebody else had 
got him a tame devil and was try-

ing to cut in,” she said. Taking a 
puff from the cigar, she settled it 
firmly in the corner of her mouth. 
At this moment, she looked like a 
fat sow that was learning how to 
to smoke. 

“George stays you are almost 
ripe,” she continued, beaming at 
Jiro. 

“Ripe? What the hell — ” 

“Don’t ask me, baby. I don’t 
understand it, but George says he 
lives on something like starlight.” 

“Like starlight?” Jiro whispered. 

“I think he means there is ener- 
gy in it,” Nellie Moll explained. 
“And that this is his natural food 
when he can get it. But he can’t 
get it often enough. Fortunately, 
for him, human beings when they’re 
soared give off some kind of ra- 
diation that is pretty close to the 
starlight that is his natural food. 

“When he says a human is ripe , 
he means that the human is scared 
and is almost ready to eat. The 
worst scared a man is, the better 
George eats. He says that just af- 
ter he cuts their throat, or slips an 
icepick past an eyeball, they ready 
get ripe.” 

She laughed, a burst of sound that 
had no merriment in it, and glanced 
around at her two cohorts. “Hey, 
boys? Ain’t that right, boys?” 

They nodded, weakly. 

Jiro felt nausea beating at his 
stomach. Was it possible that a 
creature could exist which lived 
on radiant energy? All life used 
energy in some form. Plants took 
radiant energy from the sun. But 
to 'live on the radiations given off 
by a human being when he was 



afraid — Jiro gave up trying to 
grasp all the implications involved 
in this statement. His problem was 
much simpler. It was how to stay 
alive. 

This was not a problem he had 
much chance of solving, he thought. 

CCIVTow, baby,” Nellie Moll said, 

1^1 beaming fondly at Jiro. 
“Just tell me what happened to 
them black things you stuck into 
the locker in Salt Lake City.” 

“I — ” Jiro began. 

“George is very interested in 
what you say,” she interrupted, 
looking up toward the ceiling. “Very, 
very interested.” 

Jiro considered the various ways 
in which he would enjoy destroying 
this fat sow, who claimed to be a 
human being. 

“I told you I don’t know,” he 
answered. “Maybe somebody else 
has a Tame George. Maybe that 
George watched me put the eggs 
in the locker. Maybe that George 
watched what I did with the lock- 
er key. Maybe that George told its 
owner where to find the key. May- 
be the owner got the key and 
opened the locker.” 

Nellie Moll looked startled at this 
fantasy. 

Jiro was bluffing, he was try- 
ing to find a way to stay alive for 
a few more minutes. So far as he 
had known until he had heard the 
bird chirps coming from the tiny 
radio, there was no such thing as 
a tame devil. By definition, a devil 
could not be tamed. If it was tamed, 
it had to be called something else. 

“Another Tame George?” Nellie

Moll looked shocked. She did not 
like this idea and expressed her 
dislike by biting heavily on the tip 
of the cigar. “Nah! I’m. the only 
one who has a Tame George. You’d 
better believe it, buddy I” She 
scowled at Jino. 

“All right,” Jiro said. “But re- 
member we’ve got a man dead with 
a slashed throat in a monorail train 
doing ninety miles across the desert. 
Maybe the same devil that killed him 
followed me into the station and 
watched me hide the black eggs. 
Maybe it is working for somebody 
besides you. Of course, I’m only 
guessing. If you have a better 
guess 'than mine, you’re welcome to 
it.” 

His frankness in admitting he 
was guessing seemed to unnerve 
the fat woman a little. Lying or 
evasion she expected and could han- 
dle. An honest answer left her con- 
fused. 

“Them devils wouldn’t double- 
cross me!” she said, suddenly angry. 
“They wouldn’t dare.” 

“Wouldn’t they?” Jiro asked. 
“Maybe your George is listening 
to every word you’re saying. When 
he gets ready to write you off the 
books, he’ll slip an icepick into 
your heart and go on his way.” 

“He can’t understand me ex- 
cept through, this,” Nellie Moll said, 
tapping the radio. “He can’t hear 
me without my using the radio. I’m 
not sure he sees me all of the 
time.” 

“I wouldn’t bet on any of that,” 
Jiro said. He may be hearing and 
seeing you without letting you 
know about it.” 



“George is my friend. I take good 
care of him. He likes me,” Nellie 
Moll hastily answered. “George 
wouldn’t stick an icepick in me 
when I wasn’t looking. Nah! He 
wouldn’t do it.” 

As she was speaking, she was 
turning hastily to look behind her. 
Back there were Mole-face and 
Hair-cut. Both looked as if they 
would very much like to be some- 
where else. 

“They don’t have friends,” Jiro 
said. “Only enemies.” 

Again she tried to look behind 
her, again Mole-face and Hair-cut 
tried to dodge. Again she seemed 
to search the room in a silent hunt 
for something that was invisible 
but which she knew was present. 

O n the bed, Jim Jiro was quiet. 

Although he knew it was point- 
less, he found his eyes were search- 
ing the room too, looking for some- 
thing which he could not see. Smoke 
from the cigarettes, pale blue mist 
from Nellie Moll’s cigar, filled the 
air. Was there something in the 
room that could hide behind swirls 
of tobacco smoke? 

Remembering the bird chirps he 
had heard, Jiro was sure that some- 
thing was actually present in this 
room. Those hatefilled 'bird noises 
had come from a world of fre- 
quency higher than that of the blue 
smoke, from an incredible world 
that many men had suspected exist- 
ed and had feared exceedingly. 
Suddenly the radio chirped again. 
Nellie Moll almost jumped out of 
her chair. “I forgot I had left it 
on!” she gasped. 



46 



IF 




Continuing bird chirps shrilled 
through the room. 

Listening to them, Nellie Moll’s 
face started to turn green. Her 
little pig eyes almost popped out 
of her head. 

“Boys, we’ve got to move fast. 
George says he smells men coming. 
Lots of men!” 

The three tried to get through 
the door at the same time. Nellie 
Moll literally shoved her way be- 
tween the two men. The door slam- 
med shut behind them. From be- 
hind it came the sound of feet flee- 
ing down a hall. 

On the bed, Jim Jiro sighed, and 
relaxed. He did not know how it 
had happened, but his life had 
been saved. 

Then, as something stung his left 
cheek, he realized his life had not 
been saved. 

Nellie Moll, Mole-face, and Hair- 
cut had fled. 

But George had remained be- 
hind. 

Iv 

T he thing that stung Jiro’s left 
cheek was razor sharp. 

Whether it was a razor or an ice- 
pick -shaped claw, Jim did not know. 
Nor did anyone else. No member 
of the special unit called the Peace 
Corps who had seen this cutting 
edge had lived to tell what he had 
seen. All anyone had seen of this 
cutting edge had been the results 
in the form of bodies cut into 
ribbons of meat, flesh slicked and 
carved clear down to the bone, 
vital organs cut into layers of tis- 



sue, arteries severed. All were done 
by a cutting edge that was in- 
visible and, until Calkins had died 
in the washroom of the monorail 
train, all had been restricted to the 
moon. 

Or perhaps the icepick had been 
used. The result had beep bodies 
with hundreds of tiny holes in them, 
holes in the eyes, holes in the heart, 
holes in the liver, holes through the 
guts. 

Jiro did not know whether a razor 
edge had slid across his cheek or 
whether an icepick had been thrust 
into the skin there. He could not 
move his hands, to touch the spot, 
nor could he see it. Turning his 
gaze downward, he had the vague 
impression that he could see some- 
thing there. A creature as intangible 
as moonbeams seemed to move 
there, but he was not sure he was 
seeing something or whether his 
vision was distorted. Once, he 
thought he caught a glimpse of a 
single eye watching him. 

Jim could feel moisture trickling 
down the side of his face but he 
could not tell whether the wet feel- 
ing came from sweat or from blood. 

Fear surged up in him. 

Then he remember that Nellie 
Moll had said that these devils 
could live — actually did live — 
on the fear radiations generated by 
human beings. Wildly, he wondered 
if the ancient injunction in all of 
the scriptures of the world to “be 
without fear” had had its origin in 
a knowledge of the existence of such 
creatures as these. Had they ap- 
peared on Earth before? 

As to the idea that they could live 

*7 



PEACE CORPS 




on fear radiations, he knew from 
wide reading that a frightened man 
exuded a strong odor that a dog 
could detect. Frightened people were 
more likely to be bitten by dogs than 
calm people. Perhaps a life form 
could exist which had adapted itself 
to live on the odor or on the ra- 
diations from a frightened person, 
or on both! 

A s fear surged up in Jiro, he 
realized that Nellie Moll had 
been telling the truth when she had 
said that George thought he was al- 
most ripe. The purpose of the prick 
of pain on his cheek was to fright- 
en him even more, to bring up more 
fear in him, to ripen him still fur- 
ther. This purpose was being 
achieved. Fear was rising in him. 

He caught the emotion with men- 
tal effort, resolving within him- 
self not to be afraid, telling him- 
self verbally that he was not afraid. 
As he did this, he rediscovered what 
he already knew, that in a man 
fear grown to full fury had the 
strength of a wild stallion. Words 
were the rope with which he was 
trying to hold this wild horse called 
fear. The rope was much too weak 
for the job required of it. The stal- 
lion lunged, the stallion stood on his 
hind feet, 'kicking at the air. 

Fear reached for the control of 
his imagination, seeking there the 
control center that would give it 
freedom to go completely wild. 

Jiro fought the fear. Deep inside 
himself, he reached for inner 
strength, to control the rising emo- 
tion. 

Something stung his right cheek. 



Wetness — whether -blood or sweat, 
he could not tell — ran down the 
side of his face. He tightened mus- 
cles all through his body, putting 
pressure on the wires that held his 
hands to the head of the bed and to 
the wires that held his feet to the 
foot of the bed. The wires were 
strong. They did not break. The mad 
stallion of fear again lunged, trying 
to be free. 

Something was in the room that 
could kill him at any moment it 
chose, could slash his throat, could 
thrust an icepick into his heart. 
It was teasing him now, playing with 
him as a cat plays with a half-dead 
mouse, to enjoy the squirming of 
the captive creature that was strug- 
gling desperately to retain a life 
already in forfeit. 

Jiro, struggling with equal desper- 
ation inside himself, held the rising 
fear in check. But only in check. 
He knew that holding it in check 
was not conquering it but was only 
transferring it to some hidden place 
inside himself, to some basement of 
the mind, from which it might erupt 
later. 

In the distance, in some other 
world, it seemed, he heard doors 
bang, but his now fully occupied 
mind did not register any mean- 
ing for the sound. 

“I’m going to lick you, George!” 
he whispered. What he meant was 
that he was going to control him- 
self, which could be a way to win 
a battle over his invisible antago- 
nist. 

In response, what felt something 
like three claws raked suddenly 
across his forehead. 



48 



IF 




A s this happened, the fear he had 
hidden in the basement tried to 
erupt and to add its strength to that 
of the wild stallion. Desperately, 
Jim Jiro held the stallion from lung- 
ing free. 

The thing hidden behind the blue 
smoke waited for its torture to take 
effect. Jiro had the vague impres- 
sion that it was confused by its fail- 
ure to get the expected reaction from 
him. In the past, humans had gone 
completely crazy at just the touch 
of the razor edge it used for a cut- 
ting tool. Sometimes they had gone 
into panic just by thinking about the 
meaning of this razor edge and by 
imagining it was near them. 

The man on the bed was suf- 
fering, he was partly ripe, but he 
was not going into full panic, and 
he was not going completely crazy. 
He even seemed to be losing some 
of his ripeness. To the invisible 
thing in the room, he seemed to be 
becoming less palatable. 

This irritated the thing. It did 
not understand how this could hap- 
pen. It sent out tendrils to explore 
the radiations flowing from this 
man’s body and hastily withdrew the 
tendrils as they reported minimal 
edible content. 

The thing passed from irritation 
into the edge of the zone of anger. 
It was hungry. In its invisible body, 
energy cells were nearing exhaustion. 
These had to be replaced. If they 
were not soon refilled, it might have 
to find its way out to the street and 
attack there the first person it 
found, preferably a female. It had 
discovered that women, with the 
exception of Nellie Moll, went fast- 



er and deeper into panic than men. 

If it left this basement and wan- 
dered through this great city, it 
would find plenty to eat. It might 
wander into a library where some- 
one was reading and leave behind it 
the grim record that it — something 
had been there. A person reading 
a book might feel a slight stinging 
sensation. Looking Up, he would 
think that perhaps a fly had landed 
on his face. He would brush it 
away. His fingers would reveal that 
blood was flowing from a gash 
in his cheek. As he wondered about 
this, a second stinging sensation 
would come. Then another! At this 
point, the human would go into 
wild panic. 

And it would feed! 

I ts methods of perception were 
so different from human senses 
that its method of cognizing its 
environment could not be called 
seeing. It did not truly see the man 
on the bed in the way another 
human would have seen him. It was 
aware of a pattern of shifting colors 
surrounding a heavy structure — 
the body — which was shot through 
with colors of red, violet, purple, 
and many others, all constantly 
changing and all eternally in mo- 
tion. This happened so rapidly that 
the effect of solidity was given. It 
did not see the bed on which the 
man was lying, as a bed, but it was 
aware of the electronic patterns made 
by the metal legs and by the coiled 
springs in the mattress. To it, the 
flow of electronic energy around 
these cooled springs was very beau- 
tiful. 



PEACE CORPS 



49 




Its method of cognizing the en- 
vironment, while it missed much 
that the human eye saw, also made 
it aware of much thait the human 
eye did not detect. It was well 
aware of radiation in frequency 
ranges that the human eye could 
not detect. 

It was also well aware of a grim 
law of existence, of life preying on 
life. It thought this was the only 
law that existed. As humans preyed 
on the life below them, on plants, 
fruits and animals, it preyed on 
humans. Not necessarily by choice 
— it preferred the long-ranging ra- 
diations from its home world — but 
if these were not available in suffi- 
cient quantity, it could survive on 
the fear radiations from a frightened 
human being. Plants and fruits 
meant nothing to it, animals meant 
very little. It liked men, felt it 
was superior to them, could prove 
this point to its own satisfaction and 
felt completely justified in preying 
on them if it so chose. 

The man on the bed was not 
palatable enough, not ripe enough 
just now. Therefore he had to be 
induced to produce additional fear. 
It knew how to deal with a man 
lying on his back. Extruding two 
needle-pointed tendrils, it inserted 
them into the skin just at the top 
of the man’s eyes. Experience had 
taught it that every man had a re- 
flex action to protect itself from 
damage to his eyes. 

J iiro felt the tips of the tendrils as 
they touched the upper lids of 
his eyes. Each felt like a tiny ice- 
pick. He remembered a body he had 



seen near him on the moon. It had 
been filled with hundreds of tiny 
holes, the result of something re- 
sembling icepicks being driven 
through a tough plastiskin space 
suit. As this memory came into his 
mind, the stallion in his subcon- 
scious world went crazy. The stal- 
lian thought this picture was real. 
Jiro knew it was too frightened to 
be held on a close rope, that un- 
less given some measure of free- 
dom, it would break free and would 
run wild. He gave the stallion of 
fear a little freedom, felt his heart 
jump and his breathing quicken in 
response, then checked the stallion 
and held it on a steady rein. 

He held his eyelids still. 

Pressure increased there. Pain in- 
creased with it. Jim felt his breath- 
ing quicken again. This was an 
automatic mechanism that had to 
be controlled. If he let his breath- 
ing become wild panting, hurried 
gasping for breath, his emotions 
would break completely free. To 
control the fear rising in him, he 
had to slow his breathing to long, 
rhythmic inhalations and equally 
slow exhalations. 

Doing all these things required all 
his attention, all his will power, 
all his ability to concentrate. He 
knew if he did not do them the 
wild stallion would break free down 
below and his bloodstream would 
be flooded with adrenalin. Radia- 
tions would pour out from his boclv. 

George would free! George would 
eat! George would gorge! 

In the depths of his mind at this 
moment, he hated George more than 
he hated Nellie Moll.

IF 




Jiro brought his breathing un- 
der control. With it, *he controlled 
the wild stallion of fear rearing and 
plunging in the depths of the sub- 
conscious mind. 

As the invisible thing realized its 
tactics were not producing the de- 
sired results, it thrust the icepicks 
deeper. Passing through the skin, 
the sharp points touched the tender 
flesh of the eyeball itself. 

At this added prick of pain, the 
wild stallion broke free. 

Jim Jiro knew he had lost a 
battle. 

A s he was preparing himself to 
die, he heard a thudding sound 
which seemed to come from some 
far-off world. The thud was fol- 
lowed by a crash, as of wood splin- 
tering. 

Instantly the icepicks were with- 
drawn from his eyes. 

As Jiro tried to open his eyes, to 
see what was happening, a throbbing 
sound was suddenly in the air. Some- 
where something squealed like a 
stricken and dying bird, screaming 
in pain, a noise that seemed to 
reach Jiro’s mind through some chan- 
nel other than his ears. 

Then a man began to swear. Jiro 
heard quick footsteps approach his 
bed. He opened his eyes. A bald- 
headed man wearing heavy goggles 
was bending over his bed. The bald- 
headed man was swearing. 

Vaguely, Jiro recognized the bald- 
headed man as being Mr. Urban, 
his superior officer, his boss, the 
man who gave him orders in the 
special unit he served in World 
Governments. As he was wondering 



how Urban had found him, con- 
sciousness slipped away. 

Eventually, slowly, he came back 
to consciousness. He did not do 
this of his own free choice. In his 
mind as he came back to con- 
sciousness was the thought that 
again he would have to endure a 
horror called a Tame George and 
the razor’s edge and the icepick’s 
point. Then he realized he was be- 
ing forced back to consciousness not 
only by some liquid that was burn- 
ing his lips — and lighting a fire on 
the place on his tongue which 
Nellie Moll had touched with her 
cigar — but also by the sound of 
hot profanity near him. The man 
near him, whoever that man was, 
could swear! 

Slowly, Jiro realized that the pain 
was gone from his shoulders, from 
his wrists and from his ankles. This 
felt so good he tried to move and 
found he could. This so astonished 
and pleased him that he allowed 
himself to become fully conscious 
again. 

W earing blue goggles with a 
small hole in the center of 
each lens, Urban was holding him 
in a sitting position with one hand. 

With the other hand, Urban was 
holding a small flask of brandy to 
Jiro’s lips. It was the brandy that 
was causing the burning sensation 
on his lips and tongue. Ignoring 
the pain on his tongue, Jiro gulped 
at the brandy. A fire immediately 
started in his stomach, but his will 
to be conscious, his will to be alive, 
came surging back. 

“George!” he shouted.

Now for the first time Jiro no- 
ticed a man standing at the foot 
of his bed. This main was also wear- 
ing goggles with blue colored lenses 
and with a small hole in the mid- 
dle of each lens. In addition, this 
man had what looked like a very 
strange flashlight in each hand. On 
top of each flashlight was an aim- 
ing tube with another blue colored 
lens. On the bottom of each flash- 
light was a trigger. As Jiro stared 
at this man, wondering who the 
fellow was and what he was do- 
ing there, he became aware of a 
foul odor in the room. If a hundred 
skunks had been skinned in this 
place, the smell would have been 
similar. 

He noticed now that Urban was 
coughing and that the man at the 
end of his bed looked as if he want- 
ed to hold his nose. 

“Jim, are you all right?” Urban 
demanded. 

“Well — ” Forced to think about 
himself, Jiro decided he did not 
know the answer to this question. 
His tongue was raw, his eyelids had 
pain in them. Urban seemed to read 
his mind. 

“Lie down, Jim. I’ve already sent 
a man for a local doctor,” Urban 
said. He made certain of compliance 
to his orders by forcing Jiro to 
lay down. 

“George!” Jiro said, suddenly 
remeifibering. At Urban’s urgent 
request, he explained what he 
meant. 

Urban shook his head. “That 
smell is all that is left of that par- 
ticular horror,” Urban said. He 
nodded toward the man standing at 



the foot of the bed. “Danny got 
him .” 

T ie man standing at the foot of 
the bed removed his goggles. 
Now Jiro recognized him as a fel- 
low worker on that very strange 
World Governments unit called the 
Peace Corps. “Hi, Danny, hi,” Jiro 
said. “You really — I mean — ” 
Danny tapped one flashlight with 
the other. “The lab boys came up 
with this, Jim. It projects a very 
high frequency tight beam of radia- 
tion. This thing that you call George 
screamed like a wounded buzzard 
when the beam struck him. Now he 
stinks like a dozen skunks.” 

“Great,” Jiro said. “Very, very 
great. I love you, Danny, and I 
love the boys in the lab. A gun for 
George! I really can’t tell you how 
good this makes me feel!” 

“I know how good it makes us 
all feel,” Urban said. “Up until 
now, we’ve had to sit around and 
wait for something to cut our 
throats. Now we’ve got a gun. We 
can do a little blasting of our own.” 
The bald-headed man seemed to 
expand as he spoke. “There’s a 
furor about this in the highest eche- 
lon. Space admirals are demanding 
action. The WG cabinet itself wants 
to know what is going on. Now that 
we have a gun we can go into that 
moon mine and find out what’s 
there.” 

Jiro thought about what Urban 
had said. It felt good to him too. But 
there were other things that did not 
feel good. 

“Nellie Moll!” he gasped. “And 
two men.”

IF 





PEACE CORPS 



“They must have gotten away 
just seconds before we arrived,” 
Urban answered, irritation in his 
voice. “I’ve put out a general pick- 
up order on all three of them. They 
will be picked up within hours, I 
hope.” His eyes came down to the 
man on the bed. “What did she want 
with you, Jim?” 

“Eggs!” Jiro answered. “Incuba- 
tor.” His shaken mind was still off 
the track. “I left them in a locker 
in Salt Lake City. She said they 
weren’t in the locker.” 

“I hope not,” Urban said, look- 
ing comfortable again. “We were 
lucky enough to have a young wom- 
an operator right there in the mono- 
rail station. You may have seen 
her.” 

“Me?” Jiro said. “Say, there was 
the cute chick in the skintight pants 
walking around with a transistor 
radio stuck in her ear. I hardly 
noticed her — ” 

“Next time be more observant,” 
Urban said, grinning. “We’ve got 
the eggs, Jim.” 

“Good,” Jiro answered. But there 
was still something else. “Incuba- 
tor,” he said. 

“We’ve got them in an incubator, 
and I have two men on duty at all 
times watching them through these 
special goggles. Each man has one 
of these weapons.” He touched the 
flashlight gun in the right hand of 
Danny, who was maintaining his 
position at the foot of the bed. 
“We’ve got cameras going all the 
time. One way or another, we will 
know what happens.” 

“Good,” Jiro repeated. “You’ve 
really got things moving — ” 



“That’s my job,” Urban said. 
“Lie still, Jim — ” 

4 4T)ut I’ve still got another 
question,” Jiro protested. 
“How — how did you find me?” 

“Probably the same way Nellie 
Moll followed you or the way she 
had that invisible monster follow 
you. 

“I meant to meet you at the 
airport, but I got in a f$w minutes 
late and I was just in time to see 
her bop you over the head with 
her umbrella. I followed her while 
I got one of our local men( with 
a good detector, on the job follow- 
ing you. He traced you clear across 
Chicago, from the radioactive dust 
on your hat. Meanwhile, I was 
tailing Nellie Moll. Our local man 
and I met at that rat-trap where 
you had holed up. We were just 
in time to see Nellie Moll and her 
two men load you into limousine. 
We followed it and set up a raid 
here.” 

“I see,” Jiro said. “I see.” What 
he saw mostly was how good it felt 
to be a member of such a team as 
the WG Peace Corps. If a member 
of that team got into trouble, some 
other team member was always on 
hand to help. 

“Say, she could talk to that in- 
visible monster she had with her,” 
Jiro continued. 

“Then the crooks of our world 
have established communication 
with the crooks of another world.” 
Urban said, bitterness now rising 
in his voice. “That is more than 
I can say for the people of the 
Peace Corps!”

IF 




Outside the room, hurrying feet 
were sounding again. At the foot 
of the bed, Danny deftly tossed one 
of the strange flashlights to Mr. 
Urban, who caught it with equal 
deftness. Danny then exited through 
the door. A minute later, he stuck 
his head inside again to explain 
who was there. 

“Send them in,” Urban said. 

A brisk young man carrying a 
doctor’s bag with a professional air 
entered the room. He was followed 
by two men. One carried a tank 
of oxygen, the other a stretcher. 

“There’s your patient,” Urban 
said, pointing to Jim Jiro. “I want 
him in shape to board a plane to 
Denver within an hour.” 

“Sir — ” the young man began. 

From his billfold, the bald-headed 
man took a small gold-rimmed card. 
The young doctor read it. “Oh, the 
Peace Corps,” he said, sudden re- 
spect in his voice. 

“Yes,” Urban said. “And if we 
don’t work fast, there won’t be 
any peace to keep, only pieces!”

'Tphe great ship swung into a mini- 
mal power orbit high above 
Crater 64. 

From this position, part of the 
surface of the moon not normally 
visible from Earth could be seen. 
It was a ghastly land of marsh shad- 
ows and of nightmare shapes, of 
plunging craters and of bare-fanged 
mountains rising threateningly to- 
ward the lunar sky. Seen at fairly 
close range, nothing about the moon 
was pretty. It was a land of chaos, 



of darkness, and of black night — a 
world where men, coming from the 
green softness of the Earth, could 
live only in the private incubators 
of plastidome shelters and where 
they could venture abroad only 
when wearing protective suits of 
tough plastiskin. 

It was almost as if the moon 
hated men and sought to bar them 
from her world. 

As the great ship swung into posi- 
tion over Crater 64, three smaller 
ships took up positions around it 
in such a way that the big ship 
was like the hub of a wheel. Con- 
sidered as a group, the four ships 
formed in the sky something sinn- 
ler to an umbrella. 

When the umbrella was formed 
and the four ships were in posi- 
tions so that all the area suround- 
ing Crater 64 was under observa- 
tion visually, by radar and by new 
devices that had been hastily in- 
stalled, another ship came nosing 
toward this crater, coming from the 
lower edge of the moon, where the 
main sky-port serving Earth-Luna 
traffic was located. As if to es- 
cape observation, this ship flew very 
low, and when it reached that dip 
at the moon’s limb known as Cra- 
ter 64, it dropped down sharply 
and made a quick landing near a 
cluster of plastiskin domes which 
was located at the base of a huge 
cliff. At the bottom of this cliff, a 
black hole marked the entrance 
to a mine tunnel that bored deep 
into one of the rich bodies of ore 
that had been discovered on the 
moon and which gave the satellite 
enormous value to the sky-jumping

technology now developing on 
Earth. Space itself would have to 
be explored in ships made of ore 
mined on the moon! To the left of 
the tunnel a huge pile of black 
gravel indicated the ore taken from 
the mine and dumped here to wait 
the arrival of a ship to take it to 
smelters elsewhere. 

Ore ships had stopped coming to 
this mine. 

Work had stopped in this mine. 

In the highest echelons of World 
Governments administrative offi- 
cials, this was known as the mine 
where hell had moved in. 

hen the arriving ship had set- 
tled itself down in the land- 
ing area near the plastiskin domes, 
the forward port lock opened. The 
creature that stepped down from the 
ship looked like a knight in chain 
mail armor. There were differences 
between this man and the knight of 
the middle ages. This knight had a 
powerful electric light mounted on 
the top of his helmet. The visor of 
his helmet was made of perma- 
glass which included goggles with 
special lenses colored a dark indigo 
blue. The goggles were inside the 
helmet. Each lens had a micro- 
scopic hole in the center. Instead 
of a sword, the knight carried in 
his hands* what looked like a large 
and strangely-shaped flashlight. 

The knight was Jim Jiro. 

Standing in the lock, he started 
to step down to the frozen soil, 
then quickly gave a small jump to 
keep from stepping on what was 
lying on the ground there. In this 
light gravity, the jump carried him 



a dozen feet. Turning quickly, Jiro 
flicked on the radio in his suit 

“Jump or you’ll step on a dead 
man!*’ he called out. 

The next knight jumped. Each in 
his turn was careful to leap over 
the dead man, until 21 men, besides 
their leader, had made the jump. 
Then radio inquiry came from in- 
side the ship, seeking permission to 
close the lock. 

“Okay to close lock,” Jiro said. 
“But keep a man on duty to watch 
for us. If you see us coming, get the 
lock open.” 

“Yes, sir,” a respectful voice 
answered, from inside the ship. “But, 
sir, on the ground there just out- 
side the lock — ” 

“He was probably one of the 
miners here,” Jiro said. 

“Yes, sir. But, sir — ” 

“Leave him where he is,” Jiro 
said. “I don’t want anybody out- 
side the ship who is not wearing 
armor.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

At Jiro’s order, the group moved 
toward the dark tunnel that opened 
inward at the base of the cliff. Over 
a plastiskin inner suit, each of the 
men was wearing linked chain armor 
which had been tested and which 
was guaranteed to be proof against 
penetration by icepicks or by 
weapons as sharp as razors. 

The armor idea was borrowed 
from ancient times. Armor made 
of metal of poorer quality had 
stopped arrows, spears, and swords. 

“Jim, there’s another dead man 
— ” a voice spoke over the radio 
in Jiro’s helmet. 

“I see him,” Jim answered. Look- 




56 



IF 




ing down the street that led to the 
tunnel, he spoke again. “I see at 
least tiwo more. As I understand the 
situation, when their mechanical 
digger here broke through into — 
well, into a cavern that was not 
known to exist — the miners tried 
to run. Some got this far.” His 
voice went off into grim tones as 
he finished speaking. 

Flipping another switch, he spoke 
again. “Peace Corps detail report- 
ing. There are dead men down 
here — ” 

“From your detail, Jim!” the 
bass voice of the bald-headed man 
shouted back at him from the great 
ship in the sky. “If that chain arm- 
or failed, I will never forgive my- 
self — ” 

“Easy sir,” Jiro replied. “So far 
nothing has hit our armor. The dead 
men are miners. What — what has 
happened to my eggs?” 

“I have no recent report on 
that,” Urban answered. “They 
haven’t hatched as yet, I’m certain. 
I’m also certain the admiral here 
in the ship is watching the hatch- 
ing of those eggs, me, and you 
very, very closely.” 

“You haven’t got those eggs in 
the ship with you?” 

“No, Jim. They’re in their in- 
cubator in bur laboratory in Den- 
ver. Have you — have you seen 
__ »» 

“Not yet,” Jiro answered. “But 
we’re looking.” 

“Jim, you’re not taking this thing 
too lightly, are you?” 

Jiro’s grunt had deep bitter- 
ness it in. “Chief, remember I saw 
Calkins with his throat cut. Remem- 



ber, I personally met Nellie Moll’s 
Tame George. No, Chief, I’m not 
taking these creatures lightly.” 

“Good, Jim.” 

“Now that the subject has come 
up, have the boys found Nellie 
Moll yet?” 

“No, Jim.” The deep voice had 
regret in it. “But they will find-her. 
Jim, I only wish I could, be there 
with you — ” 

“What?” Jiro interrupted. “For 
Pete’s sake, have some sense, Chief. 
Down here you’d just be in the 
way. Out.” 

J iro broke the connection to the 
man in the sky before the angry 
retort could came back in, then 
shifted to the frequency used for 
group communication. Here voices 
grumbled at him, telling him he had 
treated the chief a little rough. 

“I know it,” Jiro said. “I also 
know he is looking for an excuse 
to come down here and join us. He 
belongs up there. He has the kind 
of mind that can see a thousand de- 
tails all at once and can fit them 
into a pattern and can see which 
way the pattern is going. Up there 
in the sky that kind of a mind 
is invaluable. Down here with us 
he would get to thinking about the 
big pattern, and something wouH 
run an icepick past his eyeballs 
and — Oh, the hell with it! His 
job is to be boss. Our job is to 
fumigate a hole in a moon cliff. 
Come on.” 

The detail clumped forward. The 
sound of their feet hitting the eter- 
nally frozen moon gravel was trans- 
mitted upward to their ears. 



PEACE CORPS 



57 




Each man of this detail was a 
volunteer, each was unmarried, each 
was without dependents. Like the 
French Foreign Legion of the old 
days, the only home they knew — 
or wanted to know — was this 
strange organization called the 
Peace Corps, a name that had also 
been borrowed from the old days of 
Earth, before the human race really 
started moving spacewards. 

At the entrance to the first plasti- 
skin dome, a miner lay dead. 

“They play rough around here,” 
Overman said, over the radio. Over- 
man was short and just a little fat. 
He looked from the dead miner to- 
ward the sky, then pointed. “They’re 
also spinning webs.” 

Glancing upward, Jim Jiro saw 
the sky of space. It looked a little 
like black velvet which held little 
shining lights that were actually the 
suns of far-off space. Against this 
backdrop and against the rough 
facade of the jutting moon cliff, 
thin strands of cobwebs were dimly 
visible. 

“These were not here before,” 
Jiro said. “I wonder if they were 
hibernating inside this cliff. They 
came to life and started flying and 
started building webs when the dig- 
ger burst through into their cavern 
— ” His voice slipped away into 
speculative silence. 

“Breaking through into that cav- 
ern was sort of like opening Pan- 
dora’s box,” Ed said. “We didn’t 
know what trouble was until we 
opened it.” Ed was tall, thin and a 
little stooped. 

“On Earth, spiders build webs 
to catch flies,” Overman’s voice 



came again. “What would they catch 
in a web here on the moon?” 

4 4T)ack on Earth, the 'brains — 

-D meaning some of our top 
scientists who are in on this thing 
— were doing some guessing about 
possible reasons for spinning webs 
where there are no flies to be 
caught,” Jim Jiro said. 

“One of them guessed — and he 
admitted he was guessing — that 
the purpose of the webs is to catch 
a special kind of energy coming 
from some far-off sun. The in- 
visible monsters probably came from 
that sun in the first place. They need 
its energy to keep their life forces 
at a higjh level. This guesser be- 
lieved these webs might be anten- 
nae.” 

“We know so little — ” Over- 
man’s voice came again. “Can you 
imagine a form of life that builds 
bodies that we can’t see out of 
energy that it catches on what looks 
like spider webs? Energy or mes- 
sages? Or energy acting as a mes- 
sage? We know so little — ” Re- 
peating himself, Overman’s voice 
trailed into silence, then came again, 
stronger now. “I wonder — ” Lift- 
ing the weapon in the shape of a 
strange flashlight, he pointed it at 
the webs. 

Light raced across the face of the 
cliff as the web surged with what 
seemed to be electric fire. 

“Well, what do you know, it 
worked?” Overman said. He sound- 
ed pleased with himself, then gasp- 
ed and stopped walking. “Some- 
thing hit me right in the middle of 
my helmet!” he gasped. 



58 



IP 




“We’re being attacked!” Jiro 
shouted. Through the indigo blue 
lenses of the big goggles built 
into his helmet, he caught a glimpse 
of something that looked a little 
like a very small flying saucer. As 
he was bringing up the flashlight 
weapon to center it on the moving 
object, light streaked from his left. 
The miniature flying saucer ex- 
ploded. 

“Got one!” Ed’s voice came. 

Then other voices were shouting. 
Flashlight guns were searching for 
targets. The sky was bright with 
exploding lights. 

The attack died as quickly as it 
had come. 

“Report!” Jiro shouted. “Is any- 
body hurt? Did the armor hold?” 

Voices coming back took some 
of the anxiety out of his mind. The 
armor had withstood an attack of 
icepicks. The helmets had also 
held. 

“I got hit on my helmet right 
in front of my right eye!” Over- 
man’s voice came. 

“Did the plastic hold?” Jiro 
shouted. 

“It sure did,” Overman’s answer- 
ed. “If it hadn’t held, I would have 
an icepick through my eyeball!” 

Jiro counted noses, then counted 
again, to make sure, then reported 
to Urban what had happened. When 
urban had been satisfied that all 
members of the detail had survived 
the attack, he asked further ques- 
tions. 

“They look a little like balls of 
light through these goggles,” Jiro 
explained. “They have a tremen- 
dously complicated internal struc- 



ture that looks like a web. All of 
the strands are connected to an 
extremely bright core which is the 
heart of the monster. They can 
change shape almost instantly. I 
saw one stretch himself out until he 
was six feet long with a point that 
looked needle-sharp. Like a spear, 
he hurled himself at somebody — ” 
“Who? Is that man all right?” 

“I told you everybody came 
through safely,” Jiro answered. “I 
saw another one flatten himself 
out until his front end formed an 
edge like a headsman’s axe. Some- 
thing like this must have been used 
to kill Calkins.” 

“What happened to the one who 
made a cutting edge of himself?” 
“He died,” Jiro said. “I account- 
ed for Shim personally. Have my 
eggs hatched yet?” 

”No. Jim — ” 

“Have the boys found my girl 
friend yet?” 

“No.” 

“Okay. We’re entering the mine 
tunnel,” Jiro said. 

“Good luck,” the voice in the 
sky said. “And, Jim — ” For an 
instant, frantic anxiety was revealed 
in the voice. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Take care, Jim,” the voice said, 
fading out. 

“Yes, sir.” Jiro said. 

T he detail moved forward into 
the tunnel. Just inside the en- 
trance, the beams of the powerful 
lights mounted on top of the hel- 
mets revealed two more dead min- 
ers. 

“Why didn’t they send somebody 



PEACE CORPS 



59 




out here to pick up these bodies?” 
Overman asked. 

“They did send out a ship,” Jiro 
answered. “I was on it. Two men 
left the ship through one of the 
locks and were killed. Two more 
men were lost recovering the bodies 
of the first two.” 

“Those damned things — ” Over- 
man said. 

“If we find this on the moon, 
what do you suppose we will find 
on Mars? Or on Jupiter? Or on 
Saturn?” Ed asked. The tall man’s 
voice held depths of sudden gloom. 
“Or on the path to the stars?” 

No one attempted to answer this 
question, 'but it seemed to each man 
on this mission that the question in- 
tensified and deepened the feeling 
of cold, creeping through armor 
and plastiskin suits, that had appear- 
ed upon touching the surface of the 
moon and which now was growing 
even colder as they moved deeper 
and deeper into the mine tunnel. 
This was a strange kind of cold. 
As if the cold were some alien life 
form of an incredible kind, the 
skin of a human being seemed to 
try to pull away from it. 

“Brrr! It’s cold in here!” voices 
whispered over the radio. 

The tunned widened and became 
a great cavern with large pillars left 
to support a * roof of stone some- 
where overhead. Here the miners 
had found a large body of almost 
pure ore. At the far end of the 
cavern, a huge mechanical digger 
squatted. It had been brought piece- 
meal from Earth and had been as- 
sembled here. His light catching the 
digger, Jiro stopped. 



“One miner lived long to get 
into a plastiskin dome outside 
and to report by radio what had 
happened. This miner was one of a 
crew of four on that digger.” Jim 
swept the beam of his light around 
the huge machine and counted 
three unmoving objects that had 
also come from Earth. “One, two, 
three. Ah, yes, there they are,” 
he said, counting. 

His light swept up to the wall 
above and beyond the digger. Black- 
ness was there. The wall was miss- 
ing. Part of it had fallen inward 
and now formed a rock slide that 
almost covered the mechanical 
monster. Another part had fallen 
in another direction and was not 
now visible. 

“That blackness up there, this 
doesn’t feel to me like just the ab- 
sence of light,” Overman’s voice 
came. “It feels like a blackness 
that exists in its own right.” 

“I agree with you,” Jim Jiro said. 
“But we have to go into it, no 
matter what it looks like.” 

Carefully, the detail picked its 
way over the fallen rock until each 
man stood at the top of the slide. 
Beyond was blackness deeper than 
the heart of night, a kind of black- 
ness that seemed to swallow up the 
beams from the lights worn on the 
helmets of the men. 

“There’s a cavern here,” Over- 
man’s whisper came. “Can you ima- 
gine that right here in front of us, 
invisible to us, is actually some - 
thing , perhaps a city, perhaps a 
gigantic machine, perhaps many 
small machines, perhaps villages and 
towns, perhaps many, many forms 



60 



IF 




of life, all created out of an energy 
that exists at so high a frequency 
we can’t detect it?” His voice was 
tight with growing tension. 

“I can imagine a pit filled with 
rattlesnakes,” Ed’s voice came, also 
in a whisper. “Each with his tail 
buzzing. That’s what this place feels 
like, inside me, where I feel!” 
“We’ve still- got to go into it,” 
Jiro said. He went forward cautious- 
ly feeling his way down the slide. 
There, beyond the broken rocks, he 
found a smooth floor. On the slide 
above him, a man screamed a warn- 
ing. 

J iro turned his eyes quickly. What 
looked like a spear that was 
ten feet long was coming hurtling 
out of the darkness. At the middle 
of the slide, it struck a man. The 
point of the spear went through the 
chainmail armor, went through the 
inner suit of plastiskin, went into 
the man’s body, went through it, 
put a bulge in the armor at his 
back, then flared in incandescent 
fury as beams from the flashlight 
weapons struck it. 

“ — I saw what happened!” a 
man stuttered. “Eight or ten of 
those devils f — formed themselves 
into a single s — spear!” 

The man who had been struck 
was already falling. Like a rag doll, 
he tumbled down the rock slide. The 
falling body started several small 
slides. When the body reached the 
floor, sliding rock fell over it, cov- 
ering it. 

“There’s another spear, just start- 
ing to form!” Overman yelled. 

Jiro saw the spear come into ex- 



istence. Little objects that looked 
like flying saucers in miniature 
seemed to merge and to become one. 
The single being that resulted be- 
gan to elongate and to take on the 
shape of a needle-pointed spear. 

Beams from the flashlights caught 
it as it took on shape. Light as 
bright as that of a small sun flared 
in the darkness of this, cavern, re- 
vealing an enormous space that 
seemed to have only one object in 
it. 

Reaching for the switch to shift 
his transmitting frequency to that of 
the ship now so far away, Jiro 
suddenly caught the action. He 
switched back to the unit fre- 
quency. 

“Did anybody else see that ship 

— ” he began. “Right over there! 
A ship! One that was built on 
Earth! Did anybody else see it?” 

He cut out the transmitter and 
waited for a reply. Sudden blast- 
ing static tore at his ears. In this 
static, confused and alarmed men 
called to each other in sounds that 
had no meaning. Then the static 
was gone and a new — and familiar 

— voice was shouting across the 
moon cavern. 

“Just lay your guns down, gents,” 
the voice was saying” “Lay your 
guns down and put your hands up 
into the air and walk over here 
to the ship and come inside!” 

The voice was that of Nellie 
Moll. 

“And don’t think that armor is 
going to save your hides! Because 
what we have right here — Go on, 
show him what I mean!” Nellie 
Moll’s voice continued. 



PEACE CORPS 



61 




From the ship, light flashed. What 
followed was here soundless, but 
on Earth it would have been the 
crack of a rifle, the scream of a 
bullet and the thud of the steel- 
jacketed projectile striking and go- 
ing through linked mail armor as 
if it were paperboard. 

“I’m hit,” Overman’s voice came, 
in a whisper, while both Nellie 
Moll and the static were still. “No, 
don’t try to help. Nothing — noth- 
ing to be done — ” 

Overman’s body was falling as he 
was speaking. Like a somewhat 
plump rag doll, he tumbled as he 
fell. When he struck the floor, slides 
of rock following behind flowed 
over him too. 

“I’m going to turn the static 
back on, so you won’t be able to 
tell anybody anywhere what’s go- 
ing on here,” Nellie Moll con- 
tinued. “I’m also going to turn on 
a light. All I want to see is you 
boys walking toward me, with your 
hands high over your heads. And 
in case — in case you don’t feel 
like walking, my little friends will 
be out there to help you!” 

Harsh, grating noices that Nellie 
Moll thought were laughter came 
over the radio. As Jiro was franti- 
cally switching back to the trans- 
mitter that would put him back 
into contact with the ship in the 
sky, the static roared back into 
existence and became a continuous 
rattling roar in his ears. 

VI 

I n the great ship in the sky, a bald- 
headed man sat hunched in front 



of a microphone. Sweat covered 
his face. 

“Calling the moon detail,” he 
said over and over again. “Can you 
hear me, moon detail? Can you 
hear me? Come in Jim Jiro. Come 
in, please.” 

In an effort to hear any answer, 
however faint, he had cut out the 
loud speaker and had gone to ear- 
phones. Listening, he heard over and 
over again, the grinding noise. 

“That damned static!” His eyes 
went to the communications officer 
of the ship. 

“It’s coming from the moon sir,” 
the communications officer repeated. 
“We can’t do anything about it. 
Every frequency we can use for 
moon communications is jammed, 
sir.” 

“What can we do?” 

“Nothing, sir, except wait until 
it -lets up or is turned off. It is 
being done deliberately, sir, by 
somebody, to block our communi- 
cations.” 

The face of the bald-headed man 
became a mass of wrinkles. He 
glanced at his watch. ‘Two hours 
and twenty minutes since I heard 
from them!” he muttered. 

Behind him, an admiral shifted 
his position. Hastily the bald-headed 
man spoke again into the micro- 
phone. “Jim 'boy, speak to me,” he 
repeated, again and again and again. 
His voice was becoming an angular 
and as criss-crossed with wrinkles 
as his face. 

He was using the special com- 
munications unit which had been set 
up in the main cabin of the great 
ship. Part of this unit was designed 



62 



IP 




to carry on moon communications. 
These frequencies were jammed. 
Other frequencies, used to contin- 
uously monitor the possible hatch- 
ing of three small black eggs in a 
special incubator, while hampered 
by the moon static, were still opera- 
tional. 

“Answer me, Jim, boy,” the bald- 
headed man said, over and over 
again. Out of the corners of his 
eyes, he warily watched the other 
three men present in the cabin. 

One of these men wore the uni- 
form of an admiral of the space 
forces. The second was wearing 
ordinary business clothes but had 
the clasped hand symbol of author- 
ity in the WGC — World Govern- 
ments Council — in his button- 
hole. The third was also in ordin- 
ary street clothes but in his but- 
tonhole he had the caduceus of the 
WGHS — the Worlds Govern- 
ments Health Service. 

W hen the baldheaded man sigh- 
ed and turned to check the 
receiver monitoring the hatching 
of three eggs on Earth, the admiral 
watched him closely. When he had 
finished checking with the techni- 
cian at the Earth receiver, the ad- 
miral spoke to him, asking a ques- 
tion. 

“Sorry, sir,” the baldheaded man 
said. “Nothing as yet from either 
place.” 

“How long before you anticipate 
a definite report from your detail 
on the moon?” the admiral asked. 

“It’s impossible to do anything 
but guess, sir. Our man in charge 
of the detail, Lieutenant Jim Jiro, 



is a most competent individual, sir. 
I don’t know what kind of a sit- 
uation he has run into down there 
in that cavern but I’m sure he 
can handle it if anyone can. You 
will have a report as soon as it 
comes, sir. In the meantime — ” He 
flicked on the speaker grinding sta- 
tic. “This is all we’re getting.” 

The admiral considered this in- 
formation. His face was grim and 
bleak. “Ah, well. Ah, yes. Static.” 
He glanced around the room. “I 
want to mention, gentlemen, that 
if these — ah — devils, monsters, 
or whatever they are — are shown 
to be a threat to human life or to 
— or to human expansion in the 
Solar System or to human develop- 
ment of the lunar resources in an 
orderly manner, then they are un- 
der my jurisdiction.” 

When he had finished speaking, 
the admiral’s lips closed in a knife 
edge line. 

“I want to remind you also that 
I am responsible for the safety of 
human life in space,” the admiral 
continued. 

“Then it ali depends on how we 
define these creatures,” the man with 
the clasped hands symbol in his 
buttonhole began. 

“They have not been defined by 
the Supreme Council as being a 
large-scale threat to human life,” 
the baid-headed man said quickly. 
“Believe me, I am not defending 
them. It is that — ” 

“It is what, Urban?” the admiral 
asked. 

“It is that I have a detail down 
there on the moon,” the baldheaded 
man answered. 



PEACE CORPS 



63 




“I see,” the admiral said. For a 
split instant, his grim face softened. 
“Well, I can certainly sympathize 
with you. Once, when I was a 
young man, I had to — to sacrifice 
a detail — ” 

“Sir!” Real alarm sounded in the 
voice of the bald J headed man. 

“There are times when we must 
disregard personal feeling,” the ad- 
miral continued. 

“But we as yet don’t know what 
they are,” the man wearing the ca- 
duceus said. “They may be re- 
garded as over-sized microbes, as 
huge germs that posses very un- 
usual qualities but which are basic- 
cally bacteria. I have been com- 
missioned by the World Govern- 
ments to investigate all bacterial 
threats — 99 

The face of the admiral turned 
red. 

'T^he man with the clasped hands 
A symbol in his buttonhole spoke 
for the first time. 

“And before we take action of 
any kind, we have to exhaust every 
possibility of making friends with 
them. Remember, World Govern- 
ments represents everyone in the 
Solar System.” His voice was pious 
and his face was benevolent. 

“We didn’t make friends with 
the sabertooth tiger or with the 
cobra,” the admiral said. 

The face of the man wearing the 
clasped -hands syrnpol lost some of 
its benevolence. 

“We didn’t make friends with the 
germs of anthrax or syphilis or 
tuberculosis,” Caduceus said. 

The three men had far to much 



rank to stoop to personal quarrel- 
ing. They remained very polite yet 
each urged his own course of ac- 
tion. And each was determined to 
have his own way. 

The earphones the bald-headed 
man was wearing cut off most of 
the conversation from him. Again 
and again, he spoke into the micro- 
phone, “Calling moon detail. Jim, 
baby — ” No answer came through. 
Now and again he tried to make 
himself believe that he was actually 
hearing a voice in the heavy sta- 
tic pounding in his ears but each 
time he knew it was only the voices 
of the three men in the cabin grow- 
ing louder and louder. Of the 
three men, the bald-headed man fear- 
ed the voice of the admiral the 
most. They were in space where the 
admiral had real authority. Then 
he was aware that the admiral was 
really speaking to him. 

“Yes, sir,” he said, hastily. 

“Any news yet, Urban?” the ad- 
miral asked. 

“No, sir.” 

“Well, I suggest you continue try- 
ing to contact your detail, to order 
your men to withdraw,” the admiral 
said. 

“Yes, sir. But, sir — ” 

“You have one hour,” the admiral 
said, glancing at his watch. 

“But — ” 

If you can’t make contact with 
them in one hour, we must assume 
they are dead,” the admiral said. 

“You lousy — ” The bald-headed 
man caught himself. Only his face 
revealed what he was feeling. 

“Carry on, Urban,” the admiral 
said.

“Jim, baby — ” the bald-headed 
man began. As he was speaking, he 
was aware that the technician on 
duty at the receiver constantly open 
to receive news about three small 
black eggs was waving frantically 
to him. 

“What is it?” 

“Sir, they are trying to get 
to you from Earth, to say that 
the eggs are hatching.”

4 40o you see how it is, Mr. Jiro,” 

•^Nellie Moll said. 

“Pull off the ships outside, and 
I will take my little friends and 
leave. They’re going to take me 
and my two helpers here — ” She 
nodded toward Mole-face and Hair- 
cut sitting beside her at the table 
in the cabin of the space ship in 
the cavern. “They’re going to take 
us back to their world with them. 
They say there are lots of things 
they can learn from humans. I’m 
going to teach them all about how 
it is on Earth.” 

Sweating heavily, she was stink- 
ing too. With a small cigar clamped 
between her teeth, she looked more 
than ever like a fat sow that had 
learned how to use tobacco. 

Sitting opposite her at the table, 
Jim Jiro was fighting the impulse 
to vomit/ What was left of his de- 
tail was sitting against the wall be- 
hind him. Weaponless, their hel- 
mets gone they looked a little like 
men who had fought their last bat- 
tle — and knew it — and now were 
waiting for the headsman to come 
and put them out of their miseries. 



They had surrendered; they had 
dropped their weapons; they had 
been walking across the cavern with 
their hands in the air as they had 
been ordered, when a spear twenty- 
five feet long had hurled itself at 
them. It had penetrated through the 
bodies of four men before it had 
stopped. 

When the spear had withdrawn, 
something that had looked like a 
battleaxe with a blade five feet long 
had come at them, cutting through 
armor, plastiskin suits and through 
bodies with equal ease. The axe had 
slaughtered seven men before a 
gasping Nellie Moll had managed to 
stop it. 

Or she claimed she had stopped it. 
Jiro wondered if she had sent it 
out in the first place. 

“How much control do you ac- 
tually have over these — ah — ” 
His gaze went up to the ceiling. 
Up there, in spots the paint had 
peeled away, revealing the dull 
metal. 

Jim Jiro felt his flesh crawl with- 
in the plastiskin suit he was wear- 
ing. Between him and the ceiling, 
an invisible life form watched him. 
He had the vague impression that 
between him and the steel plate 
were thousands of microscopic eyes 
that the whole vast swarm of alien 
life had compressed itself into small 
size and had come into the ship. 

Every one of those eyes hated 
him. Perhaps they hated all humans. 

Jiro brought his gaze down to 
look at Nellie Moll. If he had not 
been so sick already nothing could 
sicken him further, the sight of 
this monstruous creature would have

IF 




done the job. Her face was sweat- 
ing grease. On her lap was the 
inevitable knit bag she had been 
carrying the first time he had seen 
her. 

“Do they boss you, or do you 
boss them?” Jiro said. 

Rage wrinkled her face and glar- 
ed in her eyes. She fumbled in the 
knit bag. “I’m boss!” She told Jim 
Jiro. “Don’t you ever make any mis- 
take about it. I made a deal with 
them, and I’m boss.” From the knit 
bag she took the same miniature 
radio set he had seen her use be- 
fore. “You up there!” she shouted. 
“Oh, I forget about the static. 
You!” She jabbed Mole-face in the 
shoulder, and he flinched and tried 
to draw away from her. “Go shut 
off that static. No! On second 
thought, Jiro might be trying to 
trick me to turn it off, so he could 
get a message through to some- 
body up above him.” 

Mole-face had started to rise. 
“Well, make up your mind, Nell,” 
he said sitting down. 

“Well,” Jiro said, looking at her. 

“What do you mean — well?” she 
demanded. 

“How’d you get here, Nellie?” 
he asked, ignoring her outburst. 

“We borrowed a ship. I thought, 
I mean P figured — ” She choked 
on the words she was trying to 
use. 

“You thought you could oome 
here and take on board every Tame 
George in this cavern,” Jiro said. 
“Then you could take them back 
to Earth and use them to make 
yourself the biggest pig in the crim- 
inal mudhole.” He nodded to him- 



self. “Yes, I see where it could 
have worked. The person Who con- 
trols these alien monsters can be 
mighty big on Earth.” 

J iro looked up at her. She was 
about to choke. Sitting beside 
her, Mole-face and Hair-cut looked 
sick. 

“But instead of getting a ship- 
load of Tame Georges, the devils 
trapped you. Isn’t that the way it 
worked, Nellie?” Jiro said. 

Animal noises came from her 
lips as she tried to speak. 

“And now what they really want 
is a ship to get them out of the 
Solar System. Is that it, Nellie?” 

“Y — yes. T — they say they 
can fly without a ship, but to go 
from the moon to the Earth, they 
would need a ship. To reach their 
home world, they must have a ves- 
sel. They say they can make chang- 
es in this ship so it will get them 
home, if we will give them time. 
They say they came here in a ship 
a long time ago, but crashed it try- 
ing to land.” 

Her voice was a mushy sound 
halfway between the grunt of a pig 
and the squeak of a mouse. 

“And just when you were ready 
to leave, several ships appeared in 
the moon sky and took up positions 
in such a way that you can’t get 
out of here without being seen?” 

“Y — yes,” the pig-mouse voice 
said. 

“So now they are trying to trade 
our lives — my men and me — for 
safe conduct passage out of the. 
system, taking you and your two 
friends with them?”

“Y — y — yes,” the pig-mouse 
said, again. 

“Do you suppose you will live 
past Pluto?” Jiro asked. 

“What? Past Pluto? Of course!” 
Anger flared in the pig-mouse eyes, 
then faded into growing doubt. 
“What do you mean by that? 
They’ve got to have me!” She point- 
ed to the tiny radio. “They’ve got 
to have me as a go-between, they 
need me to talk through, without 
me — well — ” She rolled her 
eyes as she tried to find words 
to hide the fear swirling inside 
her. 

“Past Pluto they won’t need you,” 
Jiro said, logically. “There are no 
humans past that planet. They won’t 
need you to talk out there.” 

He watched fear grow in the 
pig-mouse eyes — and grow and 
grow. The two men with Nellie 
Moll were squirming too. 

“We’ll make ’em leave us where 
they leave you!” she said. “Then 
we won’t have to go past Pluto.” 
Elation sounded in her voice. She 
had found a solution, she thought. 

‘There’s one thing wrong with 
that,” Jiro said. “I remember a 
back yard in Chicago. I remember 
kids at play there.” His voice grew 
grim and hard and mean. “No, 
Nellie, you don’t want to be left 
where human law can touch you. 
Nor do the two men with you!” 

“Damnit, why’d you have to kill 
them kids?” she screamed at Mole- 
face and Hair-cut. 

“They were causing trouble!” 
Mole^face screamed back at her. 
“You told us not to let anything 
stand in our way.” 



“You damned fool, I didn’t mean 
it that way!” she screamed back 
at him. For a time, the sound be- 
tween them was a mixture of dis- 
torted noise. 

J iro looked toward the ceiling. 

Up there, spots of light that 
seemed to be microscopic eyes 
swirled into existence, then swirled 
out of existence. 

Nellie Moll screamed louder than 
Mole-face. He subsided « into grum- 
bling silence. 

“All right then,” she shouted at 
Jiro. “We’ll leave with our friends. 
We’ll go to their home world. And 
when they come back — ” 

“They’re coming back?” Jiro 
asked. 

“I don’t know if they are or 
not,” she answered. “But we’re go- 
ing back with them. We’re tired of 
the way things are being done on 
Earth. Just plenty tired!” 

“So am I,” Jiro said. “You’re 
one of the things I’m tired of!” 
“What?” Fat cheeks puckered in 
a fat face as she glared at him. 

“I’m also tired of hearing you 
scream,” Jiro said. “What you want 
is safe passage out of here. You will 
take my detail and me with you and 
drop us later. You guarantee to 
leave the system, and we hope to 
hell you will never return!” 

“Hunh — ” 

“Cut off the static, and I will get 
in touch with my superior officer 
and find out if he and his superior 
officers are willing to make deal 
with you.” 

“So many wheels — ” she be- 
gan.

IF 




‘There’s a whole hierarchy up 
above me. To them, I’m just a pawn 
in a game they are playing. Cut off 
the static, and I will talk to them, 
and I will let you talk to them.” 

“If you’re thinking of double- 
crossing me — ” she began. 

“Then have your friends up there 
stick an icepick through me,” he 
said, gesturing toward the ceiling. 
Weariness was suddenly on him. He 
was tired of Nellie Moll, tired of 
the eternally suspicious mind that 
she possessed, tired of trying to 
deal with such minds. 

‘Til just do that,” she said, tri- 
umph suddenly in her voice. She 
spoke in the radio. 

The bird chirp that answered her 
said, “Yes. Yes. We understand 
you!” in English clear enough to 
be understood. 

Jiro stared at the little radio set. 
If thoughts moved through his mind, 
he kept them from showing on his 
face. He watched a spear mater- 
ialize before his eyes. Thinking it 
was going to impale him, he caught 
his breath, but it hung in the air 
as a threat of impalement to come. 

There it is!” Nellie Moll said, 
triumphantly. “Just look at it. If 
you try to doublecross me, it’ll go 
through you in an instant. In just 
an instant!” she repeated. 

Jiro looked at the sharp point 
that was aimed at his left eye. Be- 
hind him, along the wall, he could 
hear men stop breathing. “Cut off 
the static,” he said. 

A t Nellie Moll’s signal, Mole-face 
rose from the table and moved 
to an alcove in the cabin. A switch 



snapped softly. Jiro asked for his 
helmet, which contained the radio 
equipment. It was brought to him. 
The spear moved at the sight of it. 
He unsnapped the radio equipment 
and lifted it out. The spear backed 
away from him. He fitted the tiny 
received into his ear. The static 
was gone. 

“Calling the ship,” he said. 

“Jim? a far-away voice answered 
“Jim — ” the voice faded. 

Jiro started to speak, then stopped. 
The spear was moving again. He 
could only catch little glimpses of 
it without the special goggles, but 
these glimpses told him it had taken 
up a position above his head. He 
started to speak again, then stopped 
hastily as Nellie Moll screamed and 
lurched to her feet. 

Penetrating the right eyeball, the 
spear had driven itself all the way 
through her head. 

Screaming, she fell backward. 

What happened next was so fast 
that Jiro was not certain what was 
happening until it was done. 

Spears seemed to come out of 
nowhere. One impaled Mole-face 
through the throat, the other struck 
Hair-cut somewhere in the neigh- 
borhood of the right ear. Both were 
hard driven. Both penetrated flesh, 
bone and brain matter. 

Both produced almost instant 
death. 

On the table, the little radio that 
Nellie Moll had used spoke again. 

“These were no longer needed,” 
the little radio said. Each word was 
carefully spoken, each syllable clear- 
ly voiced. “We will deal directly 
with you.” 



PEACE CORPS

On the floor, the body of Nellie 
Moll was making thumping sounds 
as it went into spasmodic death con- 
tractions. Mole-tface lay without 
moving where he had fallen. Hair- 
cut was twisting and wiggling as he 
died. 

“Contact your chief,” the little 
radio continued. “Make arrange- 
ments for our passage from your 
system — ” 

“Jim ...” the phone in Jiro’s 
ear whispered. “Jim — ” The voice 
had a pleading note in it. “Jim . 
The eggs have hatched . ” 

“What?” Jiro said, automatically. 

“The eggs have hatched. They 
must have been hungry, Jim ... 
They have killed at least thirty men 
so far, and we haven’t got them 
rounded up yet. Jim — the admir- 
al . ” 

The words coming from the ship 
in the sky firmed the decision that 
was already in Jiro’s mind. 

“Drop bombs!” he said. “Drop 
several bombs! Blow this cavern and 
the monsters in it halfway to Mars!” 

“Jim!” the voice gasped from the 
ship. 

“These creatures are totally 
alien,” Jiro continued. “There is 
no way to make peace with them, no 
way to live in the same world with 
them, perhaps no way to live in the 
same universe! They must be des- 
troyed; ‘it doesn’t matter what the 
cost!” 

* Jim Jiro was aware of men rising 
to their feet behind him. He was 
also aware of microscopic lights 
swirling near the ceiling as the 
aliens up there began to grasp 
what was happening. 



“Drop bombs!” he continued. His 
voice was wooden, stiff, mechanical, 
but inside his heart a glow was 
forming. The glow came from the 
deep inner knowledge that belonged 
to all men who followed his calling 
— that if necessary each could give 
his life that others might live. This 
knowledge was in him now, 
strengthening him for what was 
ahead. 

“Jim!” Urban’s voice screamed 
at him from the ship. 

“There is no other way,” Jiro 
continued. “There just isn’t!” In 
spite of all his efforts to keep his 
voice wooden and mechanical, it 
caught and choked. “You have 
been a great leader and a fine 
friend, Mr. Urban.” 

“Jim — ” Urban’s voice was 
also cracked and broken. 

“Drop bombs — ” Jiro repeat- 
ed. 

“It’s already done, Jim!” Urban 
whispered, from the sky. 

“What — ” 

“When the admiral got the re- 
port on what had happened after 
the eggs had hatched, he refused to 
delay any longer. Bombs, Jim, the 
bombs are already on their way to 
your cavern!” 

In the cabin of the ship, Jim 
Jiro caught a glimpse of light 
near the ceiling. He steeled him- 
sei'f for the icepick he thought 
was coming, then saw that the 
creatures there no longer -had any 
concern with them. They had un- 
derstood his talk with the man in 
the sky and were now in mad 
flight from the ship and from 
the cavern.

IF 




J iro turned to the men who had 
entered the cavern with him. 
He rose to his feet. 

“It is good,” he said slowly. 
“That the few should die for the 
many to live.” 

His gaze swept their faces, and 
he saw in the glows in their eyes 
the meaning their lips could not 
say: that they were in full agree- 
ment with him, that among many 
other facets, to be human was to 
be willing to die that others might 
find life. Could their peace corps 
have any other purpose than this? 

Coming over the radio from the 
ship in the sky was the sound of a 
man weeping. Up there, some- 
where, a baidnheaded man was sit- 
ting hunched and bioken in front 
of a radio panel and was crying 
without shame. In the cabin of 
the great ship, an admiral and a 
man wearing a caduceus in his 
buttonhole and a man wearing 
clasped hands in his lapel were 
trying to console him. Weeping, 
he was having nothing whatsoever 
to do with them or with their con- 
solations. 

Jiro listened. He turned to what 
remained of his detail. 

“Gentlemen of our peace corp,” 
he said. “I give you peace — ” 

The floor under him leaped up- 
ward as the first bomb hit. 

Those watching on special 
screens in the ships in the sky 
over Crater 64 saw something 
come out of a great cleft many 
miles away from this crater, some- 
thing that looked like a swarm of 
bees or of hornets or of miniature 
flying saucers. As this swarm emerg- 



ed from an opening hidden in the 
cleft the first bomb hit. When they 
saw the bomb hit, when they saw 
the moon dust puff skyward, when 
they saw the moon surface fall in 
upon itself, revealing a great cav- 
ern there, the men of the ships 
knew what had happened. 

For this reason, if for no pther, 
they were very thorough in search- 
ing out and in destroying this swarm 
of alien life that had found a foot- 
hold on the moon. However, there 
was another reason for being 
thorough, this lay in the fact that 
a grim-faced admiral drove them 
relentlessly to their task of destruc- 
tion. Though they did not know, 
the admiral himself was driven by 
a weeping man who was complete- 
ly bald. 

A t the top of a barren cliff, look- 
ing outward toward all the 
suns of space, is a great shaft of 
granite. Inscribed and carved on 
Earth, it was brought to the moon 
and was securely anchored on the 
cliff above the rubble heap which 
is now a part of Crater 64. 

The great shaft is like a defiant 
spear thrust at the infinite depths of 
space by men determined that noth- 
ing shall stop them in searching 
out the secrets of the far-away sky. 

On the shaft is a list of names and 
the following words: 

HERE LIE 22 BRAVE MEN 
WHO DIED TO OPEN WIDER 
THE DOOR TO THE FAR-OFF 
SPACES. 

Heading the list is the name of 
Lieutenant Jim Jiro.

CONVENTIONS GALORE! 

by LIN CARTER 



If you can't come to Cleveland, 
here are a dozen second bests! 



L ast month in this space we were 
talking about the annual World 
Science Fiction Convention. So 
howsabout it, gang, are you going 
to catch the Tricon in Cleveland 
and hear L. Sprague de Camp’s fas- 
cinating speech? De Camp is so im- 
pressive, just hearing him talk 
creases your trousers. Well, if you 
can’t make the Cleveland scene, don’t 
give up hope and switch to reading 
Westerns, you’ve still got a chance! 

You see, every year all around 
the country, fans put on eight or ten 
smaller conventions. One or two- 
day affairs — local, regional conven- 
tionettes, usually as informal and 
relaxed *as a well-worn pair of old 
sneakers. These regional get-togeth- 
ers are scattered Hither and Thither 
(especially Thither, and not to men- 
tion Yon), and chances are good 
that one will be located near you. 
So lend an ear, or, I guess I mean, 
eye. 



New York and New Jersey 

This year. New York was host to a 
dual convention April 16th and 17th: 
the Eastercon and the Lunacon. This 
is the second time these cons have 
coincided — one is formal, like 
with programs and all that, the other 
is little more than an excuse for a 
jolly-good-fun party. The two are 
sponsored by New York’s two main 
fanclubs, the Fanoclasts and the 
Lunarians. Plus these, the first week- 
end in March each year is the date 
for the annual “open meeting” of 
ESFA (the Eastern Science Fiction 
Association in Newark , New Jersey). 
This particular bash is heavy on 
program traditionally, but it attracts 
a celebrity-studded attendance from 
the various writers and editors who 
live in and around these parts. 

The East Coast 

Philadelphia has a large, very old, 
very active fan group who sponsor 



72 




each year an ambitious, programful 
con called the Philcon the second 
weekend in November. You’ll find it 
in progress somewhere in the Hotel 
Sheraton in that city. Generally on 
hand are Frederik Pohl, James Blish, 
Lester Del Ray and L. Sprague de 
Camp (who lives in one of the sub- 
urbs of the City of Brotherly Love). 
Boston has its second annual Bos- 
kone in mid-March — 1965’s Bos- 
kone was such fun, they seem to be 
making an annual bash out of it. 
As for Washington, D.C., the yearly 
Disclave is firmly established by 
now. Disclaves are held during the 
first half of May. Light on program 
but long on partying and a chance 
to talk with some interesting people. 
Of course some of these convention- 
ettes will already have gone past be- 
fore this column sees print, but they 
go on every year the same time so 
I hope you’re taking notes? 

Down South 

The South, I’m sorry to say, be- 
ing a Florida boy myself, is pretty 
skimpy on fan activities. The reason 
for this malaise is beyond conjecture 
. maybe all the fans do what I 
did years ago and move up to the 
Big City. Well, anyway, if you 
chance to be in the environs of 
Charlotte , North Carolina, any time 
around the latter half of August, 
you’ll find something called the Deep 
Southern IV in progress. Since this 
is the fourth of these fannish hoote- 
nannies in Dixie, I hope its popular- 
ity eventually stimulates dormant 
communities in other portions of the 
South to sponsor comparable hoe- 
downs — like, say, in Texas or New 
Orleans. 



In the Midwest 

Moving deeper into the Interior, 
we find two small local affairs sched- 
uled. There’s the long-established 
Midwescon, renowned in song and 
story, whioh will be held in Cincin- 
nati at a big motel long inured to 
such cataclysms. The date is the 
last weekend in June. Come on along 
and meet Robert Bloch and Wilson 
Tucker, if you’ve a mind. If you 
haven’t, they each have half a one 
left and that should be plenty. Also, 
there’s a new local con starting up 
this year, doubtless the first of many. 
This one will be in St. Louis . It takes 
place the terminal weekend of July, 
and rejoices in the charmin’ folksy 
title of Ozarkon 1. 

Woy Out West in Coliforny 

Always a lively state, fanwise, 
California has the popular Westercon 
every year, which wanders around 
from city to city like the homeless 
waif in a certain famous comic strip. 
I am informed by Andy Porter, a 
veritable fount of fannish informa- 
tion, that 1965’s Westercon site was 
Long Beach, Cal. This year’s Wester- 
con can be found in San Diego, 
come the July 4th weekend. I don’t 
think there’s a smidgin of truth in 
the base allegation that the Wester- 
con is homeless because it causes 
such a ruckus irate city fathers keep 
running it out of town on a rail: 
this is but an idle rumor, and I am 
quietly proud to be able to scotch 
it in the bud, so to speak. 

The Westercon, by the way, is one 
of the oldest of these regional clam- 
bakes (another point of resemblance 
with the wandering waif in the comic 
strip, who must be pushing forty by 



CONVENTIONS GALORE 



73 




now). This year’s Westercon will be 
the 19th, by gad. You’ll notice these 
local mishmashes are staggered, cal- 
endrically speaking, so as not to 
boorishly obtrude upon or otherwise 
cut into attendance at the yearly 
World Con, which is always held in 
the neighborhood of the Labor Day 
weekend. 

So what happens at a local con? 

Some are excuses to vacation for 
a long holiday weekend in congenial 
company, such as the Midwescon. 
You just loaf around for a couple of 
days of casual chit-chat interspersed 
with the acquatic disturbances of a 
snoozing attendee being hurled into 
the nearest swimming pool by row- 
dies. Others are formal, with pro- 
grams and guest speakers and the 
whole bit. Take for example this 
year’s “open meeting” of ESFA 
which took place in Newark the first 
weekend in March. 

It was convened, most approp- 
riately, with an address given by 
Willy Ley, the rocket man whose 
science articles have been a long- 
standing feature of Galaxy. There 
was also a rare screening of Fritz 
Lang’s old film, Girl in the Moon , 
from the book by Thea von Harbou 
whose more famous Metropolis he 
turned into a cinematic classic of 
hoary vintage. 

Those who attended ESFA’s an- 
nual clambake this year were of the 
opinion the most entertaining fea- 
ture on the entire program was a 
panel discussion of “the commer- 
cial (/.e., MONEY) aspects of 
science fiction,” between Jack 
Gaughan (Magazine and paperback 
cover artist), Henry Morrison (lit- 



erary agent for science-fiction writ- 
ers, myself among them), and Ted 
White (a fan writer just beginning 
to make a success writing sf profes- 
sionally). The money angle to 
science fiction is one side of the 
business fans and readers rarely con- 
sider and seldom are aware of. It is, 
of course, as the panel pointed out, 
the vital factor. If a magazine 
doesn’t sell, it goes out of business. 
If a publisher can’t make money 
printing science fiction, he drops 
it. Hence this discussion was in- 
triguing and interesting, whether 
due to novelty of concept alone or 
the stinging, epigram-laden wit of 
the speakers, I cannot say. 

Other regional conventionettes 
with formal programs offer similar 
fare. Speeches. Panel discussions, us- 
ually open to questions from the 
floor, as we say in parliamentary 
lingo. Screening of rare science-fic- 
tion films — or sometimes advance 
showings of new, not-yet-released 
sciencenfiction movies. Auctions of 
books, magazines, original magazine 
covers and interior artwork. Not in- 
frequently the distinguished fannish- 
historian - cum - hardcover - sf - an- 
thologist, Sam Moskowitz, gives a 
speech in his familiar, resonant, 
chandelier-shaking basso profundo. 
Moskowitz illustrates these with col- 
or slides projected on a screen. If 
you attend as many of these regional 
hootenannies as I do, you eventually 
exhaust the full spectrum of the 
Moskowitzian repertoire. I saw him 
cover (no pun intended) cover art 
on science-fiction magazines at Phil- 
adelphia, fanzine covers at New 
York’s 1965 Lunacon — and what he

IF 




will do for this year beggars the im- 
agination. 

Mostly, though, whether the con 
has a formal program or is just a 
lazy weekend of carousal, the force 
motivating fans to get out of their 
accustomed weekend lethargy and 
attend is, simply, the pleasure of 
meeting and getting acquainted with 
folks who share their own passionate 
devotion to Our Favorite Brand of 
Entertaining Reading. 

To get right down to it, frail flesh 
affords few pleasures more intense, 
for the small-town science-fiction 
reader, than that of actually meeting 
in person the famous writers whose 
works he has read for many years. 
After following the literary ventures 
of Robert A. Heinlein or Poul An- 
derson or L. Sprague de Camp or 
Isaac Asimov or others of compar- 
able magnitude — you can imagine the 
thrill of meeting these demi-gods and 
talking (yes, actually talking) with 
such Olympian Beings. I can recall 
the puzzled feeling I got first meet- 
ing, many long years ago, the legend- 
fraught John W. Campbell, Jr., and 
discovering that he was not, after all, 
twenty feet tall, but of the same 
calibre as ordinary, if lesser, mortals. 
You may get the same kick when 
you discover Ed Emsh or Fred Pohl 
or Jim Blish do not, after all, eschew 
the igorhiny of having a cup of 
coffee with a tongue-tied and en- 
thusiastic admirer. They are just 
plain folks, gang, and get just as 
much of a kick out of meeting their 
admirers as you will out of meeting 
them. As Isaac Asimov confessed to 
me once, ablush with modest con- 
fusion: “You know, all year long I 



am just another Bostonian, but the 
convention gives me a " chance to 
be a celebrity , for at least one week- 
end out of the year!” 

You might be diffident about in- 
terrupting their aloof cerebrations to 
ask for an autograph . but you’ll 
be pleased to discover they do not 
really mind granting the honor. And 
some professionals get so ^embar- 
rassed at the unusual celebrityship 
thrust upon them only, on a conven- 
tion weekend, they may actually ask 
you for your autograph! 

Magazine editors, in particular, 
are happy for the chance to mingle 
with their readership and thus find 
out (from the horse’s mouth, as it 
were) exactly how the mag is going 
over with the average citizen who 
has to fork out a couple of coins 
each month to procure the latest 
number. Jovial illustrators like Jack 
Gaughan, the guy who does so many 
covers, enjoy talking with people 
who can intelligently discuss the art- 
work in science fiction. Keep in 
mind that most science-fiction writ- 
ers, editors and illustrators work 
pretty much in a vacuum . they 
mingle and correspond with other 
professionals largely, and know how 
their peers feel about the current 
level of their work, but except for 
the handful of reader-letters printed 
in those very few magazines that 
have letter columns at all, they don’t 
know first (hand how they are coming 
across with the consumer. 

So don’t be hesitant about attend- 
ing one of these conventionettes, if 
convenient to you. You’ll find it a 
lot of fun — it might even make a fan 
out of you! END

They were only two teen-agers, alone

CHILDREN IN THE SKY 

F rom all the reading Dolph had 
done in his relatively short 
life, and from the same amount of 
observation of people, he had been 
more than entitled to conclude that 
any real rescue was years away, 
if it were ever to come at all. True, 
most of the people he had known 
personally were pleasant people 
who were fax from short either of

What Has Gone Before . • • 

Teen-ager Dolph Haertel was attempting to discover the secret of 
anti-gravity. He had three things going for him — his intelligence; a 
family that encouraged research — and the fact that he didn't know 
it was impossible, in the orthodox view of relativistic science. And so he 
succeeded. He fitted out his tree house with an anti-gravity generator 
and propelled himself on a tryout expedition to Mars. 

But there his luck ran out. The basic power tube was damaged in 
landing. It was irreplaceable on Mars — and he had no way to get 
off Mars. Nor could Earth's much-vaunted space programs help him. 
Relying on chemical rockets, they were years behind schedule — worst 
of all, no one knew he had gone. 

Or almost no one. Dolph's nearest neighbor teen-ager back home 
— who happened to be a girl named Nanette — had been let into his 
secret, just a little bit — but enough so that, with what he had told her 
and what preliminary models he had left behind, she was able to follow 
him. 



She did . and now there were two teen-agers stranded on Mars! 



money or of good will — people who 
would not hesitate to help some- 
one in trouble if they could, or 
thought they could. By the same 
token, most of the fiction he had 
read had been about fantastically 
self-centered, unwashed people with- 
out a grain of human kindness even 
toward tjiemselves, who seemed to 
depart from prolonged acts of sui- 
cide only to strike out at the peo- 
ple around them. Between the two 
he struck a rough sort of balance 
. and concluded that on Mars 
he was on his own. 

His knowledge of the state of the 
art called space flight, as it had 
existed at the time he left Earth, 



was equally rough, but roughly ac- 
curate. There was no hope for a 
really adequate expedition for 
years to come, even on a crash 
basis, to rescue him — which he 
could hardly hope for. Earth’s tech- 
nology simply wasn’t up to it yet. 

In all this, he was quite right, 
but he had left out one factor, 
simply because he had never heard 
of it. That was not his fault; no 
example of it had turned up dur- 
ing his lifetime. It was that factor 
which newspapermen, in their bru- 
tal but not always cynical jargon, 
call The Baby Down the Well. 

To be sure, at first Dolph’s and 
Nanette’s parents had suspected the

77 




worst — which, as Nanette had 
known automatically, meant an elop- 
ment, either with or without mar- 
riage. But time and lack of evi- 
dence disposed of (that awful notion 
— time, lack of evidence and a 
creeping willingness to believe that 
no matter how they had zigged and 
zagged in the past, neither Nanette 
nor Dolph could have broken with 
their character and their back- 
grounds so completely and at the 
same time. Faiith had set in. 

r Le next horrible suspicion was 
kidnapping and murder. But 
no ransom notes arrived, and no 
bodies were found. Finally — and 
with rising despair that any outsider 
would have mistaken for self-right- 
eous fury — the families concluded 
that the youngsters had simply gone 
camping and had lied about it (in- 
ventively, outrageously, but probab- 
ly borrowing the fantastic elements 
from Something They Had Read) 
to gain time for an unusually long 
trip. But at long last this story, 
too, fell to the ground of its own 
weight, for there was no evidence 
for it at all. 

During all this time — a matter 
of weeks — the ground around 
both homes was literally strewn with 
clues which could point in only one 
direction — the direction in which 
Dolph and Nanette actually had 
gone, and in which Nanette had hon- 
estly said’ that they had gone. Since 
at bottom what both families wanted 
most in all the world was to have 
their children back safe and whole, 
they were finally left with no re- 
course but to believe in the only 



evidence, as well as in the honesty 
of their children. 

It took a long time, for none of 
the adults had any better opinion 
than Dolph had of how the authori- 
ties would greet such a story. But 
the time the families had taken to 
mull over the alternatives in pri- 
vate both stood in their favor and 
drove them out of themselves. They 
had done their best, with their own 
limited resources and that of the 
local police. Now they had to do 
more; and they did not stint. 

They sent telegrams to their sen- 
ators and representatives. They ap- 
pealed to the President and to N. A. 
S. A. big-wigs both in Washington 
and at Cape Kennedy. They made 
long-distance telephone calls to 
scientists in the space program. They 
pulled wires; and — most courage- 
ously of all — they talked, without 
pulling any punches, to the Press. 

The Press had heard it all and 
cried Hoax. 

To the papers and to television 
alike, it was only another Silly Sea- 
son story, like the previous decade’s 
obsession with flying saucers — 
something to fill up space during the 
last of a hot summer, while im- 
portant news tends to be slow be- 
cause most of the world’s movers 
and shakers are on vacation, and 
most readers and viewers are too 
fagged with the post-vacation blues 
to care whether what they are told 
is an important piece of news or an 
obvious piece of nonsense. During 
the Silly Season whiat 'both the press 
and the public most wants is some- 
one to make fun of, to fed super- 
ior to.

IF 




The two desperate Iowa families 
filled the hill nicely. They got the 
full treatment. Their nights were 
filled with despair; their days, with 
impotent rage. 

But not even the Silly Season lasts 
forever, and here and there several 
important people had already lis- 
tened to the two families and had 
taken them seriously — or had 
stopped to think what it might mean 
to the space program if they were 
taken seriously. 

In Washington, somebody high 
up in N. A. S. A. who knew Mrs. 
Haertel spoke soberly to somebody 
even higher. Slow machineries be- 
gan to awaken from their summer 
sleeps. A mathematician in London 
who had been a renegade from rela- 
tivity all his life read the garbled 
newspaper stories, covered eighteen 
pages of foolscap with calculations 
only two other men in the world 
could have any hope of following, 
and sent them by ordinary post to 
one of those men. His assistant pru- 
dently photographed the calcula- 
tions before they were enveloped 
and sent the negatives, hidden un- 
der a postage stamp, to Moscow, 
where the other man was. (There 
are many different kinds of rene- 
gades in the world, and they do not 
always know when they are work- 
ing together.) The man in Moscow 
brooded over them for a long and 
dreadful night and decided to risk 
his life, his career, his family and 
even his country on them — though 
perhaps not exactly in that order. 
The lonely operator of a 68 -foot 
radio telescope in the Australian out- 
back focused his gigantic dish- 



shaped antenna on Mars and picked 
up from, he could not tell where 
on that remote desert, traces of a 
signal which might have come from 
a small but heavily sparking electric 
motor, and began to compose a 
brief technical paper to be called 
“Irregular Broad-Spectrum Mar- 
tian Probability Anomalies” for a 
journal called Proceedings of the 
Swiss Society for the Freedom of 
Ether , which in consequences would 
not be seen by anybody likely to be 
interested in it for decades to come. 

There was more — most of it not 
known of at the time, and much of 
it still hidden in obscure files all 
over the world, some of it out of 
secrecy, some out of simple ignor- 
ance — but all of it working, how- 
ever siowly, in the same direction. 

A nd less slowly, because the pres- 
sures on it were greater, the 
Press found the Silly Season over 
and the story still standing . not 
only alive and unrefuted, but show- 
ing some signs of official interest, 
of being after all important:. The 
Press made inquiries of the appro- 
priate officials, but was rebuffed 
without comment. This only made 
the story seem more likely to 
be important, after all. And with 
nothing official to go on, the Press 
was driven back to rediscovering 
the Baby Down the Well. The 
Press handled it like this:

The world was indeed fully as 
bad a place as Dolph had assessed 
it to be — indeed worse, for his 
memory encompassed no important 
war — but all the same, let one 
Baby fall down a Well, and all the 
resources of technology are mustered 
to save it, while the rest of human- 
ity, on the spot in spirit and pass- 
ionately applying body-English from 
the sidelines like rooters at a bill- 
iards tournament, hangs upon the 



half -hourly bulletins from the Press, 
Well intentioned but stupid peo- 
ple sent the two anxious families 
money. Others turned up in droves 
simply to gape at their homes, or 

— until police cordons stopped it 

— to cut or dig souvenirs. More 
interviews were sought than the 
families could have granted even 
in a 24-hour day devoted to noth- 
ing else. Thousands of persons who 
had never looked at the sky be- 
fore in their lives could now point 
to where they thought Mars was, 
and it was astonishing how many 
times they were right A quasi- 
mystica! hobby called “the Mars 
vigil” captured a number of minor 
religious sects, especially in south- 
ern California (where the fact that 
Mars was a red planet also con- 
vinced some of the politically reli- 
gious that the Children in the Sky 
were just more paTts of the great 
Communist Plot, along with UNI- 
CEF and mixed marriages) — in 
addition, of course, to the un- 
countable number of prayers offer- 
ed in all the major churches of the 
world. 

B ut the element which gives the 
Baby Down the Well its sus- 
pense is the knowledge, lurking al- 
ways at the back of everyone’s mind, 
that there must soon come a time 
after which all the effort and all 
the hope will have been for noth- 
ing. Detective work far more 
thorough and scientific than any the 
families could even have engaged, 
let alone paid for, soon established 
within quite small limits of error 
what supplies Dolph and Nanette

IF 




had taken with them — and there- 
fore, the maximum time they could 
be expected to stay alive, assuming 
(for the sake of hope) that they 
both had landed on Mars gently and 
without any hurt, loss or damage. 
It was immediately evident that the 
von Braun , the Ares Project’s flag- 
ship, could not be completed within 
that time — let alone launched upon 
a crossing it would then take the 
ship 228 days to make. 

(This fact, however, in no way 
discouraged the newspapers from 
sponsoring bus trips by high school 
science clubs to Cape Kennedy to 
watch the von Braun being built 

— though there was very little to be 
seen from the distance over which 
the trippers had to look even after 
they reached their destination. The 
trippers themselves made fine copy 

— almost as good as candid-camera 
or the man-on-the-street interviews. 
The television networks agreed.) 

And no amount of detective work, 
nor scientific research, either solo 
or in conference, did better than ap- 
proach the margins of the discovery 
by which Dolph and Nanette had 
made the trip. This fact alone in- 
creased the urgency to rescue the 
youngsters to a pitch almost as high 
among scientists as it was in the 
families — not only because the 
knowledge was wanted, but because 
the scientists suspected in Dolph 
a mind of a caliber not seen on 
Earth since the death of Norbert 
Weiner, or perhaps even the im- 
mortal Hermann Weyl. After all, 
Dolph had made the discovery 
which (the scientists had not — 
and could not even with the most 



important fact in their possession, 
a fact that Dolph hadn’t had: that 
the thing could be done and had 
been done. 

The time ran out, inexorably. 

Toward the end, the New York 
Times began to post in Time 
Square the number of days the 
youngsters had left, and then, the 
number of hours. For the last day 
of all, the Times put up the red ball 
impaled upon a pole, ‘ the fall of 
which usually indicated nothing 
more momentous than the election 
of someone to the presidency of 
the United States. This time, its 
fall would mark the expiration of 
the last calculated moment of life 
for the Children in the Sky. The 
world waited. 

The ball fell at 11:32 P.M. East- 
ern Daylight Time, twenty-nine days 
after Dolph had left the Earth. A 
huge, silent crowd had gathered to 
watch. With its falling, there was 
a concerted sigh — almost a whis- 
per of it left individual lips, but 
magnified by numbers into a sort 
of wave-like moan. 

For the rest of that month, flags 
flew at halfmast all over the world. 
No one can estimate how many mil- 
lions watched the televised memorial 
services. 

Then the flags returned to their 
usual positions, and the production 
of memorial books and pamphlets 
— and souvenirs — began. With the 
coming of fall, the serious business 
of running the world began to come 
back into the headlines. 

The case of the Children in the 
Sky was over. 

Or so it seemed. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTH RISE 



ei 




D olph must (have reached Nan- 
ette within six or seven sec- 
onds after the crash, though to him 
it seemed an eternity of running 
and searching. The impact had re- 
duced her crate to a jumble of 
planking and other, more anony- 
mous debris, but the Martian star- 
light was more than bright enough 
for him to see her inert body un- 
der the rubble. 

He wasted no time. Snatching off 
his respirator, he clapped it over 
her face, secured it and heaved her 
up out of the wreckage by the 
shoulders. If it had taken him an 
eternity to get to her, there was 
no word for how long it seemed to 
take him to drag her back, through 
the bitter, blasting cold in which 
he could no longer even breathe — 
let alone dare to gasp — to the 
dubious haven of his own craft. 
Bundling her awkward, incoopera- 
tive form through his airlock was 
also maddeningly time-consuming; 
by now his head was swimming. 
But somehow, he got them both in- 
side. Then he just sat and panted. 

He had, after all, gone out for 
exercise. But this much had almost 
(been fatal. 

After a while, however, he had 
recovered enough to take a look 
at the girl. She was in bad shape. 
To begin with, she was so blue with 
cold, and probably with oxygen star- 
vation, that he could not tell where 
her blueness was also due to bruis- 
er — as a lot of it surely was. That 
landing had been hard. If she also 
had broken bones, or even more 
serious injuries, he would be un- 
able to guess at them until she re- 



covered consciousness and became 
able to tell him where and how she 
hurt worst. 

For the time being, there was 
nothing he could do but keep feed- 
ing her pure oxygen through the 
mask, and warm her up. For the 
last purpose, the blanket alone 
wouldn’t do. Without a single sec- 
ond thought, he crawled under it 
with her. 

It was more than a little like bed- 
ding down with an extra-large rub- 
ber ice-bag. Nevertheless, toward 
morning, just before dawn, she 
seemed to be warmer, and Dolph, 
who was very cold, managed to 
sleep a little. He was awakened 
again by the morning sandstorm. 
Afterwards, Nanette stirred a little 
and muttered something unintelligi- 
ble underneath the oxygen mask. 

Dolph got up promptly, remov- 
ed the mask and shut off the oxy- 
gen. Then, with creaking muscles, 
he set about making a meager 
breakfast. Nanette, now looking nor- 
mally pink except for a magnificent 
black eye, continued to snooze peace- 
fully. He did his best not to dis- 
turb her. She needed the sleep — 
and he needed more time to think. 

For him, it was very clear, the 
case of the Children in the Sky was 
far from over.

WINE AND STORM 

E xcept for the black eye, and a 
few other, more extensive bruis- 
es whose location Nanette refused 
to specify, there turned out to be

IF 




nothing wrong with Nanette that 
oxygen and warmth could not cure. 

But it had been a near thing. Her 
crate had leaked enthusiastically 
during her crossing to Mars so that 
she had lost consciousness while 
still trying to land. That was what 
had caused the crash which luckily 
had been caused solely by a short 
fall under Mars’ weak gravity, not 
by any still-uncanceled momentum. 

It was still possible, of course, 
that she also had gotten a severe 
radiation dose during her crossing. 
But as the days went by without her 
losing any hair, turning pale, or 
developing any nausea, Dolph de- 
cided to discount that. Except for 
the bruises, she was almost glaring- 
ly healthy — and hungry. 

“Well, did you bring any food?” 
he demanded. 

“As much as I could pack into my 
ship. Remember, it was smaller 
than yours.” 

“Meaning that I’m going to have 
to split with you,” Dolph said. 
“And that probably goes for oxy- 
gen and everything else, too. Wuff! 
Nan, it was nice of you to come 
after me — and darned smart, too 

— but we’re in a spot. You shouldn’t 
have done it.” 

“I’m here,” Nanette said prac- 
tically. “And I’m willing to learn 

— and cooperate. If it helps, I’m 
sorry I didn’t give your notes on 
the anti-gravity to somebody, and 
sorry I didn’t t hink ahead about a 
lot of other things, too. But I didn’t, 
and here I am.” 

“Okay — okay. Now we have 
to stay alive. I guess the next thing 
to do is look through that crash 



of yours and see what we can sal- 
vage.” 

“Good! Let’s go.” 

“Not so fast! And, Nan — try 
not to bounce so. It wastes oxygen. 
Believe me, we’ve got to think about 
every move here before we make 
it.” 

“I’m sorry,” Nanette said, so in- 
stantly contrite that Dolph felL like 
thirty-three different kinds of heel. 
“I’ll wait for orders.” 

“It’s not a matter of orders,” 
Dolph said, and then had to stop 
and wonder just how to explain to 
this burstingly alive girl that she 
might die any minute in any one of 
hundreds of ways — as she almost 
had several times already. “The 
first thing is, I’ve got only one 
mask, and only one set of heavy 
clothes, and only one pair of gog- 
gles. You don’t dare go outside 
without those things. Outside is — 
well, it’s like the worst features of 
the top of Mount Everest, plus the 
worst of a salt desert like Muroc 
Dry Lake. It’s warm enough around 
noon, but except for that, it’s dead- 
ly.” 

“But I already knew that,” Nan 
said in some surprise. “I brought 
goggles and a mask — I just didn’t 
think to put thenl on while I was 
landing. They’re out in the wreck, 
along with my oxygen bottles and 
my sewing kit.” 

“Oh, Well, I’ll have to go and 
get them myself. If they’re all right, 
after that we probably can go out 
together.” 

“Fine,” Nanette said. “While 
you’re gone, I’ll make breakfast.” 

“No, no!” 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



83 




“Now what’s the matter?” 

A gain Dolph had to swallow and 
start over. “We’ve already had 
breakfast, Nan — and lunch and 
dinner, too. One meal a day is the 
rule here. And no cooking. While 
it lasts, we eat the stuff as it comes 
out of the can. Luckily those field 
rations heat themselves when you 
open them, and we can use any ex- 
tra heat we get. Don’t waste any 
by trying to dress things up. We 
just can’t afford it.” 

For a moment Nanette looked 
as though she were about to frown, 
but instead, she smiled slightly. 

“All right, I’ll forget cooking. 
Maybe I’ll dust — no, I guess that 
comes under the head of bouncing. 
Well, at least I won’t have to worry 
about dieting. Back home I was 
getting kind of pudgy.” 

She paused, looked at Dolph cri- 
tically, and then laughed outright. 

“You look like a dog trying to 
figure out a porcupine! Go ahead, 
Dolph. I’m human, and I’ll be all 
right, really I will.” 

“That’s good,” Dolph said doubt- 
fully. The girl was in many ways 
a bigger problem than Mars was, 
and one about which he knew far 
less. But since he had no choice, 
he dressed and went out anyhow, 
trying to distract himself by won- 
dering what he would find in the 
wreokage — and what he would 
find when he came home. 

He did not notice that this was 
the first time he had called the 
surviving packing-crate “home.” 

He was, moreover, totally un- 
prepared for what he found when 



he did get back. Nanette had found 
the root of the irregularity in the 
pump cycle, which had been elud- 
ing him for weeks. 

“What was it?” 

“Nothing to it,” she said calmly. 
“You forgot to oil it, that’s all.” 

“But — what did you oil it 
with?” 

“I rubbed the axle-points against 
my nose. If I’ve got to have a 
greasy nose for the next ten years, 
I might as well use it for some- 
thing. Sit down and stop gap- 
ing, Dolph, and show me what you 
salvaged.” 

I t had been too much to hope 
that Nanette’s power tube had 
survived her crash, and indeed it 
hadn’t. But there was a surprising 
amount of supplies and tools that 
had, and with this plus an addi- 
tional person the interior of Dolph’s 
crate changed from being almost 
intolerably crowded into being im- 
possible. After thinking the matter 
over, Dolph evolved a solution 
which also gave him a use for some 
of the lumber from the derelict. 

“I think the best place to build 
it would be on the airlock side,” 
he added. 

“But what? It’ll just be in our 
way.’ S 

“No, it won’t, not much, and it 
might help to keep us our way 
out. Maybe you’ve noticed that the 
sandstorms always blow from west 
to east — just like weather on 
Earth — and the airlock faces north. 
Some day we’re going to have a 
really big blow, and the sand might 
dune up against the airlock. If I

put the leanto on the north side 
and put its entrance on the east, 
we’ll have some protection against 
being sanded in.” 

“Makes sense,” Nanette admitted 
at once. “Also it gives us a longer 
shadow.” 

“A what? I mean, sure it does, 
but what of it?” 

“The sand blows almost in a line 

— horizontally. If the house is 
twice as long as it is now, it’ll catch 
twice as much sand against its front 
and give use twice as wide a low- 
sand lane in the bade.” 

“So it would,” Dolph said. “And 
that might 'be worth a lot to us 
some time. Sharp.” 

“Thank you.” 

“In fact if you hadn’t been sharp 
you wouldn’t be in this mess at all,” 
he added. Her slightly smug expres- 
sion evaporated. “Well, let’s get on 
it. With what’s left over from the 
lumber, we can put up a windmill 

— I think that old Exide’s past due 
for a recharging.” 

They were not able to pressurize 
the leanto. Dolph would have liked 
to, not only for the extra living 
space it would give them, but also 
because it would afford them separ- 
ate sleeping quarters. Dolph was 
not greatly worried about the pro- 
prieties at this distance from home, 
and in any event, between the ex- 
hausting life they were forced to 
lead and the thoroughness with 
which Nanette had absorbed a rather 
Puritan upbringing, he doubted that 
romance was going to be one of his 
major troubles. Nevertheless, they 
were the only human beings on an 
entire planet — and very little on 



this whole rusty world could be 
more dangerous to them than a 
pregnancy. 

But he could not build the new 
structure to sufficiently dose toler- 
ances to caulk it, even had he had 
enough extra pitch to do the job. 
He had to settle for moving more 
than half of their possessions into 
the shed, which at least gave them 
noticeably more floor space in their 
present living quarters. 

The windmill-generator worked 
well, which emboldened Dolph to try 
at last the production of oxygen 
by electrolysis of tumible-lichen sap. 
This worked too, thus confirming 
his theory that the sap was large- 
ly water; but it also confronted them 
with a problem which he should 
have anticipated, but hadn’t. Once 
the sap was gone, it left behind a 
brown, gummy residue which was 
a prime nuisance to clean out. And 
once he had his still going — thus 
also solving their drinking water 
problem, at least for the foresee- 
able future — the resin accumulated 
in that, too. 

CCTt must be good for something,” 

A he said thoughtfully. 

“To eat,” Nanette suggested. 
Nothing on Mars discommoded her 
so much as her own stomach. 

“I’d hate to try it. If the chinks 
in the leanto weren’t so big I’d 
try it for caulking.” 

“Stuff them with dried lichen. 
We’ve got bales of the stuff out- 
side, even allowing for what blows 
away.” 

“It won’t pack solid enough. But 
maybe . hmm. You know. I’ll

bet that if we shredded it fine 
enough and used this goo for a 
binder, it might make passable pa- 
per. 

“Goody,” Nanette said with heavy 
irony. “Then we can keep a diary.” 

“If I keep one, I’ll Tell All,” 
Dolph said. It was remarkable how 
Nanette’s presence cheered him, no 
matter how she complicated his 
problems — or perhaps it was not 
so remarkable after all. “But I was 
still thinking about caulking. We 
can smooth' out the sand in the 
leanto for a tray to make the paper 
in, and turn It out in big sheets — 
we don’t have to care if it isn’t 
uniformly thick — and plaster it up 
on the walls, as many layers of it 
as we need. Then we can caulk and 
pressurize. I’ll bet it would take less 
than a month.” 



“Better had,” Nanette said am- 
biguously. “Wallpaper on Mars! 
Well. I vote for a floral pattern.” 
“Why?” 

“Because I’m going to live there, 
so I get to choose.” 

“Idiot. Let’s go try it.” 

But her suggestion that the resin 
might be good to eat continued to 
work on him, somewhere at the 
back of his mind. Sooner or later 
— sooner, now that Nanette was 
aboard — they were indeed going 
to have to try the tumbledichens 
as food and pray that they were 
indeed edible. He decided to at- 
tempt the experiment alone and in 
private; there was no point in 
jeopardizing both of them. When? 
Not, at least, until after the wall- 
papering project was finished. By 
then, Nanette would have had 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



87 




enough experience of Mars, and 
enough warning of the traps he had 
encountered before her arrival, to 
have at least a good chance of sur- 
viving alone as he would have had 
. and a rather better chance than 
they had of surviving for any length 
of time as a couple. 

The obvious need to keep this 
plan a secret made facing up to it 
doubly hard. Somehow he was not 
helped by the fact that the wall- 
papering project was a resounding 
success and made Nanette as cheer- 
ful as a puppy at the prospect of 
having her own quarters. He won- 
wered if, after ah, she wasn’t just 
a little too cheerful, too optimistic 
about living on Mars, to take the 
problems of survival there alone with 
enough seriousness. Wouldn’t it be 
better to wait until — 

But he recognized this line of 
reasoning in time as the excuse it 
was, and grimly fought it off. When 
the appointed time came, he was 
not exactly ready to greet it gladly, 
but at least he was still determined. 

Nanette was in “the next apart- 
ment”, earnestly picking up an ob- 
ject from here to set it down there 
— a feminine rite which these 
cramped quarters had at last taught 
Dolph to appreciate. He was facing 
about half an ounce of tumble- 
lichen sap, freshly squeezed from 
the press and hence quite cold. He 
thought he how understood, too, 
how Socrates had felt when faced 
with the hemlock. Taking a deep 
breath, he tossed the swallow down 
with a most unphilosophic grimace. 

Then he held his breath and 
waited. 



T he response was not long in 
coming. It astonished him com- 
pletely. 

Whatever he had expected, it 
had not been this. Gradually, but 
with increasing speed, there crept 
through his body a feeling of total 
well being. He was no longer hun- 
gry, no longer thirsty, no longer 
chilly, no longer even tired. Yet it 
was more than just an adding up of 
negatives: he felt strong, alert, as 
ready for anything as he had ever 
felt in his life — and he had seldom 
been ill. 

He wondered: Is this what it’s like 
to be drunk? But he had experi- 
mented with alcohol once, and it 
felt nothing like this. For one thing, 
it had made him feel happy, almost 
gay, whereas there did not seem to 
be any emotional edge to the sen- 
sation caused by the sap. For an- 
other, it had made 'him giddy; well, 
he could test that. He walked across 
the room and back; no, no dizzi- 
ness. 

He noticed that he was still hold- 
ing his breath and let it out. 

“It was several seconds before he 
realized that he felt no desire to 
take another. 

He looked at his watch, and al- 
lowed another ten seconds to go by; 
fifteen; then twenty. He still felt not 
the slightest need to breathe. A mar- 
velous suspicion smote him, and he 
called out: 

“Nanette!” 

“What is it? I can barely hear 
you.” 

“Come here a minute, will you? 
Important.” 

After he called, his diaphragm 



88 



IF 




gave a small heave — just enough, 
he would guess, to replace the air 
he had used in calling. Then his 
chest was quiescent again. 

“Dolph — Dolph, what’s the mat- 
ter? You look so strange!” 

“How so? I mean, in what way? 
Do I look sick, or have I turned 
green or something like that? 

“No, you don’t look any differ- 
ent that way,” Nanette said. “It’s 
just your expression — like you’d 
just seen Banquo’s ghost or some- 
thing. What is it?” 

“I don’t know yet, but it could 
be something big. Do me a favor 
and take my pulse. Tell you why 
afterward.” 

“Sure, but — oh!” She snatched 
her hand back. 

“What now?” 

“It’s nothing. You’re cold. It 
startled me.” 

“I thought so. Go ahead with the 
pulse.” 

She took it and then stared at 
him incredulously. Then she took 
it again. 

“This is crazy,” she said. “It 
isn’t more than twenty to the min- 
ute. Dolph — you are sick!” 

“No, I don’t think so. With a 
pulse of twenty I ought to be dead. 
But I feel fine. In fact I feel 
great. And I* think our lives have 
just been saved. If you watch me, 
you’ll notice I’m not breathing 
either, that is except when I start 
talking to you.” 

“If you don’t stop being myster- 
ious,” she said grimly, “I am go- 
ing to pick up the nearest blunt 
instrument and make you good 
and sick. Talk!” 



G rinning, Dolph told her of his 
experiment with the sap. She 
was furious; it took him the bet- 
ter part of ten minutes to get her 
calmed down. 

“I know, I know. Everything you 
say is true, but all the same it had 
to be tried. And look, Nanette, this 
stuff is better than food. It stows 
down the metabolism — stows it 
way down, about five times. We’ll 
use that much less food, that much 
less oxygen, that much less water. 
And there’s something else. Ill 
check this very carefully, believe me, 
but it might even make it possible 
for us to live outside without masks, 
at least for a few hours at a time 
during the day. We’U save on heat, 
too — I’ll bet my body tempera- 
ture’s going to wind up at about 
half normal — and we’ll be glad 
of that in about a year.” 

“Why a year?” 

“Because then it’ll be winter. The 
Martian seasons are four times as 
long as they are on Earth.” 

“Hmm. I still think it was fool- 
hardy, but .... I want to try it.” 
“No,” Dolph said firmly. 

“Don’t give me that! If you can 
make a nitwit of yourself, I can 
too. And if there are any benefits, 
I ought to be entitled to them.” 
“No argument — but the experi- 
ment’s less than an hour old. The 
stuff could kill me. Even if it 
doesn’t there may be longterm bad 
effects — what the doctors call 
chronic toxicity. And then there’s 
this business of feeling so good; it’s 
like a drug. Maybe the sap’s addict- 
ing.” 

“Even if it is, there’s obviously 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



89 




plenty,” Nanette said, but she did 
not press the point. “Okay, I’ll hold 
off for a little while, anyhow. How 
long are you going to insist upon?” 
“Oh — say a week. Not really 
long enough, but it’ll have to do. 
I want to experiment with the dose, 
too; maybe I took more than I 
need, or — well, we just don’t know 
yet. What now?” 

Nanette had cocked her head 
and had stopped listening to him 
with more than half her mind. 

“Listen to the wind. That’s not 
just the evening blow. It’s getting 
worse.” 

After listening a moment for him- 
self, Dolph had to agree. “I wonder 
what that means?” 

“Didn’t you say we had a year 
to go until winter? Then we’re just 
at the beginning of autumn here. 
This is such a small planet, the 
winds must change pattern pretty 
sharply with the seasons. And I 
think it’s just started to change.” 
“I think you’re right.” Dolph 
strode to the porthole and looked 
out. “Look at that sand! It’s get- 
ting thicker every second. This could 
be a bad one.” 

Nanette nodded soberly. “If you 
ask me,” she said, “that week is 
going to be a long one.” 

IX 

THE LONG BLAST 

N anette was right. That night’s 
sandstorm was only half an 
hour longer than usual, but the next 
morning’s was better than an hour 
longer; and as the week wore on, 



the situation worsened steadily. By 
the end of the week, there was 
only about an hour around noon 
(and, presumably, another around 
midnight) when the air was quiet 
and clear. It was evident that the 
porthole would be covered shortly 
— and after that, perhaps the house 
itself. 

Their only hope lay in the fact 
that the wind continued always to 
blow in the same direction — 
though now from the south. Both 
the change and its constancy baffled 
Dolph for quite a while, but finally 
he thought he saw glimmerings of 
an explanation. 

“Look,” he said, drawing a circle 
on a scrap of left-over wallpaper. 
“Say this is Mars, looking down on 
it at the North pole at the time we 
arrived — just before the equinox, 
when the equator is warmer than 
the poles, just like it is all year 
around on Earth. While it’s like 

that, the air ought to circulate like 
it does on Earth. Here’s the di- 
rection of rotation, counter-clock- 
wise. Now — ” he quickly sketched in 
something like a ship’s propeller, 
its center at the pole, its blades bent 
away from the direction of rota- 

tion — “that gives us a travelling 
wave up in the stratosphere, a jet 
stream, like this, going in and out 

toward the pole twice a day but 

blowing in the same direction the 
planet rotates. Of course that never 
touches the ground, but — ” he put 
in four ovals trailing after the 
“blades” of the “propeller” — “it 
trails four high-pressure spots out 
toward the equator, and those give 
us our dawn and dusk winds. If we 



90 



IF 




were farther north or south, say at 
about forty-five degrees of latitude 
as we were in Iowa, we’d hit low- 
pressure cells that would have the 
same effect. So that’s why the 
weather always moves from West 
to East, just as it does at home.” 

“Which is why the wind is blow- 
ing steadily north now,” she agreed 
gravely. “Brilliant, Holmes, bril- 
liant.” 

“No, it isn’t idiot. Now winter is 
coming on, and winter on Mars 
isn't like home, because then one 
Martian pole is warmer than the 
equator — which never happens at 
home.” He drew another circle. 
“Here’s Mars in winter. Then the 
wind blows from one pole to the 
ether, going along the ground from 
the cold pole to the warm one, and 
back up and over through the stra- 
tosphere. And it’ll go right on like 
that through the soltice to the next 
equinox.” 

She considered this in silence for 
a few moments. 

“It makes sense, all right,” she 
said at last. “And I don’t think I 
like it, Dolph. With the wind blow- 
ing from the cold pole steadily, all 
the time, for nearly a year — well, 
it’s going to be cold around here.” 

“Sure it is,” Dolph said. He took 
her hand, tentatively. “But look, 
Nanette, we knew that already. We 
knew it before we ever left the 
Earth — we just didn’t know exact- 
ly why. Even at noon it won’t get 
above freezing around here, not 
by more than ten degrees at the 
most, and it’ll be blowing all the 
time. But by being here, we’ve got- 
ten a break we couldn’t have ex- 



pected or foreseen at home: the tum- 
ble-lichen sap. If that works out, we 
won’t be too awfully cold, and we’ll 
come through.” 

N anette closed her eyes, and 
slowly shook her head. 

“What’s the matter, Nan?” 
“Dolph, Dolph — the lichens 
will all be buried. They may be 
buried already. And they die in 
winter — we saw that from the 
Earth, too!” 

After a moment, Dolph put his 
hand to his forehead. 

“That’s true,” he said, stunned. 
Nan, we’ve got to go out.” 

“Into that storm?” 

“Yes. We don’t have any choice. 
We can still dig in the lee of the 
house — the ‘shadow’ you talked 
about. We’ll have to, before the 
sand gets any deeper. We have to 
pack the leanto full of lichen, while 
we can still get it, or we’re dead.” 
“All right,” Nanette said. “Then 
pass the bottle, Dolph.” 

“The time isn’t up.” 

“I don’t care. I won’t go out 
into that storm without some sort 
of juice under my belt. If I do, 
neither of us will come back.” 
There was no arguing this. Silent- 
ly, Dolph put the wine-press into 
action. Despite the gloominess of 
their situation, he was forced to 
chuckle at the parade of expressions 
that crossed Nanette’s face as the 
elixir took hold. If he had looked 
like that when she had first seen 
him after he had tried it, he could 
understand why she had been 
alarmed. 

“Wow,” she said. “That’s great. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTH RISE 



91 




I don’t see how anything that good 
could foe poisonous.” 

“I just hope that doesn’t come 
under the heading of famous last 
words,” he said. “But we’ve got 
no choice — we can’t get along 
without it now. Better get dressed 
now. The sand out there’s getting 
deeper by the minute.” 

T hey managed to dredge up sev- 
eral bushels of tumble-lichen 
during a quiet noon, before the 
storm drove them inside again. This 
in turn yielded about a pint of sap 
— enough to last quite a while, for 
Dolph had discovered that a tot of 
it barely large enough to swallow 
was sufficient to carry him through 
a full 25-hour day, while a larger 
dose, while it exerted its effects 
somewhat longer, was in the long 
run wasteful. Nevertheless, they lost 
no opportunity to augment the sup- 
ply, for — as Nanette had remind- 
ed him — when the winter had 
firmly closed in there would be 
no more lichens for months to come. 

For the rest of the time they 
were hard put to it to fill up the 
hours, for though there was much 
that they needed to be doing to pro- 
vide against the future, most of it 
could not be done while the storm 
raged. Nanette had adopted her own, 
originally half-frivolous suggestion 
of keeping a diary. There had been 
a great deal to record in it at first, 
but as . their confinement wore on 
the entries became shorter and short- 
er. Nevertheless, she kept at it, for 
even a bare notation of the passage 
of a day had the minimum virtue of 
keeping their calendar up to date. 



‘1 wish we could have some light, 
though,” Nanette said. “Not to stay 
up at night with, but for days when 
the weather is like this. Since the 
sand started blowing I can hardly 
see what I’m writing. Can’t we spare 
the electricity, now that the wind- 
mill’s working? Or is the battery 
going to go dead on us some day, 
too?” 

“The battery’s new, and this type 
ought to be good for about a 
thousand rechargings,” Dolph said. 
“And we can take power directly 
from the generator as long as the 
wind blows. But I’m just not up to 
making a carbon filament — and 
besides, even if I could, and got a 
bulb blown, I couldn’t evacuate it 
.... Hm. Don’t need to. I could 
just take it outside and seal it up 
out there — 200 millibars of nitro- 
gen ought to be nearly as good as a 
vacuum for this purpose. I’ll think 
about it. Maybe it could be done.” 

While he thought, he busied him- 
self cannibalizing the anti-gravity 
rig to build a crystal radio. It had 
occurred to him that it might just 
barely be possible to pick up one 
of the strongest of Earth’s broad- 
casting stations, or perhaps one of 
the networks if all the stations in 
a network broadcast on the same 
frequency — a question to which 
he could not remember the answer, 
if indeed he had ever known it. In 
the loneliness and silence of Mars, 
even the lobotomized ravings of 
WABC might occasionally be a wel- 
come reminder of home, however 
tenuous. 

While he worked, the wind blew 
on monotonously, and the sand 



92 



IF 




mounted toward the bottom of the 
porthole. The oasis was an oasis no 
longer, but a well of red murk, 
except at noon when the sun shone 
briefly down upon endless waves of 
ochre dunes, none the less depress- 
ing for a wild and patternless beau- 
ty, like a sea of blood frozen in 
mid-tide. 

“What are we going to do for 
light after the sand piles up over 
the portholes?” Nanette wanted to 
know. 

“Go out and shovel it away, I 
guess.” 

“What, Mr. Edison — still no 
magic electrical glow-lamp?” 

“Nope. Just shovelling.” 

“Pooh. And I always thought 
space travel would be glamorous.” 
But at least she still seemed to 
be cheerful — or was making a 
brave show of it. Perhaps the elixir 
helped; heaven knew there was lit- 
tle enough else to be cheerful about. 

T he storm did not stop at the 
end of a week, but by the end 
of two it seemed to have reached 
a sort of inflection^point, after 
which it carried away about as much 
sand as it brought in; though by 
then the burden of detritus was 
high enough to require daily trips 
outside to clear the porthole. 

By then the radio was almost 
finished, and high time, too. The 
circuit had not given Dolph any 
trouble, except with his memory, 
but contriving an earphone — he 
would have preferred a loudspeaker, 
for Nanette’s benefit, but he did 
not have the necessary transformer 
to drive one — had almost defeated 



him. The design was simple enough 
but he had no piece of steel thin 
enough to serve as a diaphragm. In 
the end he had manufactured one 
out of iron filings imbedded in bak- 
ed tumble-lichen resin. It was not 
as flexible as he would have liked, 
but he thought it would serve. 

For several evenings thereafter, 
his cat’s-whisker probing of the 
ether — or whatever was doing duty 
for the ether these days — brought 
him in nothing but the faint wash 
of background white noise which 
is the sound of stars — that “music 
of the spheres,” plus occasional 
bursts of aural hash which were most 
probably static from the Sun itself. 
Evidently no AM signal in the stan- 
dard broadcast band was powerful 
enough to push its way through the 
Kennedy-Heaviside layer of Earth’s 
atmosphere and have enough 
strength left to reach Mars. Too 
bad. He had half expected it, but 
still it would have been pleasant to 
have been able to pick up a little 
music now and then ... to say 
nothing of an occasional human 
voice, were it only some pitchman 
touting headache pills. Instead, the 
only man-made signal that came 
through the earphone was the steady 
flickflickflick of his own pump, like 
the distant sound of someone single- 
mindedly dusting a piece of wire 
screening with a whiskbrook. 

The other signal, when he finally 
found it, was markedly softer but 
there was no possibility of its being 
man-made. 

CCT don’t like it,” Nanette whis- 

JL pered, her eyes wide, the

clumsy phone pressed to her ear. “It 
sounds like — like an animal in 
pain.” 

“Well, it could be somebody sing- 
ing — I’ve heard worse,” Dolph said 
judiciously. “But I don’t think it is.” 

“Then what — ” 

“Wait a minute, and you’ll know 
everything I know about it. I made 
up a loop antenna after I happened 
on this thing. Watch what happens 
when I rotate it.” 

Her eyes widened once more. 
“The sound gets louder! . There, 
now it’s faded again.” 

“Yes, I swung the loop back out 
of line. I can’t pin it down more 
than approximately, but it seems to 
be coming either from west-north- 
west of where we are — or from 
exactly the opposite direction, of 
course. In other words, either from 
somewhere in Syrtis Major, or in 
the direction of ‘Arabia’. Or from 
somewhere much farther away, more 
likely, by the weakness of the sig- 
nal.” 

She lowered the earphone and 
stared at him. 

“But, Dolph — that must mean 
— oh, no! Do you think that some- 
body’s come for us?” 

He took the earphone from her 
and listened for a long moment to 
that high-pitched, infinitely melan- 
choly, ululating whine. It went on 
and on, as though the thing that 
produced it had no need to pause 
for breath: The sound went through 
the inside of his skull like the pain 
of a dentist’s burr. 

“No, I don’t think so, Nan. It’s 
far too soon for that. And whatever 
else that noise is, it isn’t a human 



noise. Or any other sound that was 
heard on Earth.” 

“Then — ” She stopped, as though 
uncertain whether to be hopeful or 
alarmed. “Then it has to be Mar- 
tians! Oh, Dolph, do you think they 
might help us? Do you think they 
could?” 

“I don’t see how,” he said gently. 
They don’t even know we’re here. 
And I’m not so sure but that I’d 
rather have it that way, at least until 
we know more about them. At the 
moment we’ve got nothing to go on 
but that noise, and I don’t find 
that any more reassuring than you 
do.” 

He listened to it again, then shook 
his head. 

“As for us finding them — well, 
at the distance they’re bound to be 
at, Nan, we couldn’t possibly make 
it ^without flying. For all the good 
they can do us right now, they 
might just as well be on Pluto. Or 
on Earth. It comes to just about the 
same thing in the end.” 

He put the earphone face down 
on the table. Nanette did not bother 
to nod, but it was clear from her 
expression that she could not much 
mourn the evanescence of a hope 
so suddenly raised ... at the very 
least, not this soon. 

Outside the house, the long blast 
blew on regardless.

IF 




as any living human being is ever 
likely to imagine. And as Dolph and 
Nanette found, a yearlong winter 
spent in a primitive hut is not a 
noticeable improvement. 

Of course there was never any 
snow, but fine sand makes a per- 
fectly acceptable substitute, and is 
even more difficult to keep out of 
the house. As for cold — mediated 
though they were by the tumblelich- 
en elixir, the night-time temperatures 
in the house were often ferocious. 
Outside, they were always so low as 
to be outright meaningless. 

Nanette bore it the less well. Des- 
pite all that Dolph could do with 
jokes, word games, improvised chess- 
men and sessions of hard physical 
work — and there was certainly very 
little of that he had to improvise — 
her innate cheerfulness wilted stead- 
ily, melting gradually into becoming 
morose, sullen and solitary. The 
small bruises that she inevitably sus- 
tained, often simply from bumping 
into things in the narrow confines 
of the hut, hung on for weeks, and 
after a while, too, he began to sus- 
pect that there was something wrong 
with her eyes. 

It was only after two episodes of 
something suspiciously akin to delir- 
ium, however, that he realized that 
she was specifically ill. It was most 
probably a nutritional deficiency of 
some sort; Dolph had no way to 
judge which one, since such things 
had long been extinct in the part 
of the world in which he and she 
had been brought up, but he sus- 
pected beri-beri. Luckily, it did not 
seem to be grave, at least not yet. 
But it worried him. Even worse, it 



deprived him of her help and com- 
pany alike most of the time. 

In her absence, he took on also 
the chore of keeping up the diary. 
In the remaining time — of which 
there was a lot — he listened to the 
ceaseless, wavering cry from the 
crystal radio. There was a pattern 
in it, of that he was sure. Sometimes 
he felt almost on the verge of grasp- 
ing it. Then, once more, it would 
fall apart into meaninglessness. 

He thought that with a cathode- 
ray oscilloscope and a high-speed 
camera he might have cracked the 
problem in short order — but he 
might as well have wished for a 
million dollars, the Taj Mahal and a 
broiled lobster with drawn butter 
and a spring salad. (Never mind 
that.) As matters stood, he had 
nothing to fall back on but close 
listening, patience and a mathema- 
tician’s faith in the existence of or- 
der at the heart of every puzzle, 
even on Mars. 

And slowly, slowly, these began 
to pay off. His first assumption, that 
the noise was in fact a voice — for 
it certainly did sound organic, like 
an animal in pain, as Nanette had 
said — he discarded eventually on 
common-sense grounds. Nothing an- 
imal could go on and on like that, 
hour after hour, week after week, 
not even a WABC announcer who 
didn’t need to breathe. If the mes- 
sage being sent were 'both important 
and unique, it couldn’t possibly be 
so long — and so limited in range. 
If, on the other hand, the message 
was brief and repetitious, as seemed 
more likely, it would surely be as- 
signed to a machine — unless the 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



95 




imagined Martian had a commercial 
sponsor, which hardly seemed likely. 

A machine then; but if so, what 
kind of a machine, and what 
was it sending? First of all, there 
was the possibility that it was “send- 
ing” only by accident, like the noise 
made by Dolph’s pump, and that 
the sound carried no information 
(other than being characteristic of 
the machine that made it). But this 
was the only such Mars -bom sound 
that Dolph could pick up. This pre- 
supposed either (a) that the Mar- 
tians didn’t know how to shield their 
electrical machines, and that this one 
therefore was the only one in this 
part of the planet; or, (b) that they 
did know how to shield, and had 
shielded all their machines but this 
one. Neither notion was logical 
enough to be worth any more study 
for the time being. 

Okay; then the signal was mach- 
ine-generated and repetitious, but 
there was a message in it — -inten- 
tionally. 

To know that much about it al- 
ready — no matter with what reser- 
vations — had to be counted a solid 
gain. Nevertheless, it was not much 
more than a beginning. 

What might the message be about? 
Before Dolph could know that, he 
had to know how he was supposed 
to be receiving it. True, he had 
picked it up as a sound, but that 
was no guarantee that it was being 
sent out as one. All he knew about 
that for sure was that it came to 
him as radio waves which he could 
translate into sound waves, but which 
the Martians might translate into 



something else — or might be able 
to sense directly, as Dolph could 
sense light waves directly. 

Now there was a thought. Sup- 
posing the signal was supposed to 
be translated first into a picture — 
that, in other words, it was a tele- 
vision broadcast? At first he rejected 
the notion out of hand, since he was 
getting the broadcast on a wave- 
length rather low in the standard 
AM band, whereas television re- 
quired high-frequency transmission. 
Later, however, he remembered 
vaguely that very short waves had 
not been available when TV had 
been invented, at the dawn of the 
century. The primitives had sent sta- 
tionary pictures by low-frequency 
AM, and even by wire. 

But if the Martian noise were even 
so simple a TV transmission as that, 
to translate it Dolph would need a 
pierced-spiral scanning disk — which 
he could make — and a powerful 
but sensitive amplitude-modulated 
light source, which he couldn’t. All 
right, scratch that — and hope that 
it’s wrong anyhow. 

But wait a moment; was he giv- 
ing up too easily? Any such noise 
as he was now hearing would not 
translate into anything but the sim- 
plest of pictures — a cross, say, or 
an ellipse — and that certainly 
would not make even a good test 
pattern for a useful television set. 
Its very simplicity suggested that it 
had been designed to be easy to 
pick up, and easy to identify, and 
over continental distances at that. 
Dolph could think of only one kind 
of signal that would have to satisfy 
all three of those conditions: 



96 



IF 




A beacon. 

And what could be more likely, on 
a planet where the desert was su- 
preme over vast areas for three 
years out of four, and even the 
vastest landmarks might be oblit- 
erated by a sandstorm in a matter 
of days? If fixed bench-marks were 
needed, they would have to be estab- 
lished where nature could not touch 
them — except, briefly, with solar 
static: in the eletromagnetic spec- 
trum. 

What Dolph was listening to, un- 
likely though the notion was on a 
waterless planet, was almost surely 
a lighthouse. 

What use he was going to make 
of the discovery was a question 
for which he could see no answer at 
all. 

H e had no more time to think 
about it now, in any event, for 
somewhere on the far side of the 
dead of winter, Nanette began to 
improve slightly and thereafter was 
much more trouble than she had 
been when most iU. Dolph was 
delighted; every other problem but 
this went completely out of his 
head. 

The improvement was small 
enough, in all conscience, but he 
fostered it like a wren trying to 
raise a cuckoo-chick. At first, she 
only talked in her sleep and al- 
lowed herself to be fed without 
objecting more than feebly to his 
interfering with her private night- 
mares, even when she discovered 
him sitting with her after a black- 
ly howling night. Then, she became 
wakeful enough at times to be- 



come embarrassed that he had been 
doing sanitary patrol for her while 
she had been unable to do it for 
herself. He had a hard time per- 
suading her that he ought to con- 
tinue to do it for a while to con- 
serve her much dwindled strength. 
He won that only by reminding 
her brutally that she was on Mars 
— which she had forgotten merciful- 
ly at her worst crisis. After that 
she was docile, though depressed. 

As her spirits lifted, she began 
to ask that he tell her stories. 

The task baffled him completely. 
Though enormously sensitive to the 
poetry of mathematics, he had no 
literary imagination whatsoever. The 
outcome of the proposal was that 
she told him stories. This embar- 
rassed him at first, but the tales 
she invented — fantastic improvi- 
sations about six-legged animals 
who needed boots to ward off a 
bad cold, dragons abashed to dis- 
cover that they had fluffy pink 
wings, bears who went space-travel- 
ing in a rocking-chair (well, what 
really was so fantastic about that, 
now?) — were so unpredictable, 
and she seemed to take such de- 
light in alternately surprising and 
outraging him, that he concluded 
they were at least as good for her 
as anything he might have concoct- 
ed, with talent or without it. 

Glad though he was to see her 
beginning to recover, however, he 
was nevertheless at a loss to un- 
derstand why she was recovering — 
or what it was she was recovering 
from. He had done nothing for her 
that he had not been doing all 
along, and there had been no other 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



97 




change around them that he had 
been able to detect. For example, 
his guess that her problem was a 
dietary deficiency now had to be 
ruled out; her diet was exactly what 
it had been for months. 

Equally obviously, she could not 
have had and sort of systemic in- 
fection, for had it been acute she 
would have recovered — or died 
— much earlier, whereas if it were 
chronic she would not be recover- 
ing now. Had it been simply the 
blues? A serious depression of the 
spirit, a kind of poisonous despair, 
which had expressed itself in a 
random collection of physical symp- 
toms? That was possible, of course, 
but it seemed grossly out of harmony 
with what he knew of her character 
and -her youth. 

He let the problem rest for a 
month, finding no handle by which 
he could even begin to grasp it 
with any confidence. In the mean- 
time, however, her partial return 
toward normal human converse — 
slow though it was — encouraged 
him to broach the question to her, 
once he felt she was strong enough 
not to be discouraged by his puzzle- 
ment. 

She promptly alarmed him all 
over again by laughing. 

“T ’ve been thinking about that 

JL myself,” she said. “There are 
parts^ of it that I noticed long be- 
fore you, but I didn’t want to bring 
it up because — well, because well- 
brought-up young ladies aren’t sup- 
posed to discuss such things with 
males, not even relatives. But 1 guess 



this isn’t exactly an ordinary situa- 
tion, either.” 

“Listen, are you sure you’re feel- 
ing all right? It isn’t that important, 
now that you’re mending. We can 
wait until — ” 

“No, Dolph, I really am making 
sense. The thing is, this planet 
doesn’t have any moons, or at least 
the ones it does have are so small 
that they might as well not be 
there.” 

“Moons? But, Nanette — ” 

“Hush and let me finish, will 
you?” she said firmly. “On Earth 
the moon is important to all sorts of 
things, not just the tides and the 
calendar. It has something to do 
with the weather, and there are lots 
of animals — even ones you’d never 
guess, like fiddler crabs — seem 
to time some of their behavior by it. 
Isn’t that right?” 

“Yes, it is,” he said. Belatedly, 
he was beginning to see what she 
was driving at. 

“Okay. It affects people, too. That 
business about crazy people get- 
ting crazier at certain times of the 
month — it was even called ‘lun- 
acy’ — wasn’t just superstition. And 
everybody knows that us female 
types run on a lunar calendar . 
except that on Mars, it seems, we 
don’t.” 

“So that’s it.” 

“Well, that’s part of it, any- 
how I think,” Nanette said. “I 
noticed that something was amiss 
not very long after I got here, and 
since then just about nothing has 
gone the way it’s supposed to. I 
must have gotten pretty toxic, and 
probably my hormones were all out 



98 



IF 




of. balance, too. I’m just going to 
have to adjust to a new schedule, 
that’s all — and so is every woman 
who comes to Mars, I’ll 'bet. I’m 
just glad it’s over this time.” 

“I hope it is. But how can you 
be sure? I mean — what do you 
think made the difference?” 

She smiled. “Why, Dolph, that’s 
easy. Spring is coming.” 

“Spring?” he said numbly. “Yes, 

I suppose it is. Not that we’ll no- 
tice any difference for quite a 
while yet.” 

“I’ve noticed,” she reminded him 
firmly. “And you will too if you 
listen. You’ve been so busy worrying 
about me this past week, you haven’t 
even noticed that the wind has 
changed.” 

Startled again, Dolph got up and 
bounced awkwardly to the port- 
hole. Sure enough. The air was v 
still hazed with ochre dust, but the 
narrowing fan of land where the 
drifts had been lower, the lee area 
they had taken to calling “the back 
yard,” showed long feathers of 
sand curling off the tops of its 
dunes, horizontal to the building. 
Gradually the yard was being swept 
clean. 

While he stared, there was a soft 
thump from above, like the sound 
of a cat jumping off a table. 

He looked up automatically, and 
then out the porthole again as two 
more thumps hit the crate roof. 
This time, one of the objects came 
falling into view and hit the ground 
before him, still rolling before the 
wind. It was about the size of his 
head; once, beyond question, it had 
been bigger. 



It was a tumble-lichen, fallen into 
the oasis after having been blown 
across a thousand miles of steppes 
and clefts. It was not as pretty as 
a first robin, but it was a thousand 
times more welcome. 

Spring was indeed begun; the 
“wave of quickening” was on its 
way north from the melting and 
subliming polar cap. 

B ut no buds showed, and no 
birds sang. It was still cold as 
death outside, and the air as thin 
and lifeless as it had always been, 
and always would be. Only the 
gradual replenishing of the food 
suppiy and the still more grad- 
ual rise in the noonday temper- 
ature maxima showed that the 
grip of winter had broken. They 
were still confined to quarters, ex- 
cept from the briefest of forays 
to collect lichens and clean the 
pump-filter. At least these broke 
the monotony of their days, a lit- 
tle. 

Except for the journal, they 
would never have noticed the day 
when an Earth year had passed 
since Dolph’s spoiled landing. 

The Martian year was not much 
more than half over — how much 
more, it was hard to guess, for 
Dolph and Nanette had necessarily 
been counting Martian days, of 
which there are 668.6 to a Mar- 
don year. By Earth time, the Mar- 
tian year is 687 days. Either way, 
however, there were better than 
200 days to go to the end of the 
first Martian year. 

To the eye, nevertheless, the 
oasis outside the crate and the 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTH RISE 



9f 




leanto softened as the days wore 
on. As the wind lessened, the periods 
of good visibility began earlier in 
the day and ended later in the 
afternoon. The lichens spread grad- 
ually, too, not just occasional 
migrants now, but establishing them- 
selves on the floor of the crater. 
The time was foreseeable when 
there would be a carpet of them 
again, as unbroken as it had been 
when Dolph had first seen it. 

The moderating weather suggested 
to Dolph the possibility of explor- 
ing the oasis, at least in short for- 
ays in the hours bracketing noon. 
Though he was reluctant to admit 
it, what he was hoping to find was 
an artifact — any object, no mat- 
ter how small, how old or how 
broken, which had been made by 
some guiding hand and brain, not 
just a product of nature. It seemed 
to him that by Martian standards, 
this valley had to be considered so 
sheltered and verdant a place that 
it must be known to whatever en- 
tities were responsible for the mys- 
terious radio signals. Even if they 
were not using it now, he reasoned, 
they must have visited it at some 
time in the past and left some sign 
of their passage, even were it only 
a few pieces of their equivalent of 
garbage. There was a lot one could 
learn, after all, from midden J heaps. 

But they found neither midden 
nor artifact. If the valley had in- 
deed ever been visited, the visits 
must have been brief and far apart 
— or too long ago to have left any 
traces Dolph’s inexpert eye might 
recognize. Of course, Dolph’s and 
Nanette’s brief, random diggings 



hardly qualified as skilled, inten- 
sive excavation, but Dolph was 
reasonably sure that had there ever 
been a lot of traffic in the oasis, 
they would have hit upon some sign 
of it. There was nothing. 

They did, however, find some- 
thing that Dolph thought might be 
of even greater value to them in the 
long run: a Martian animal, of a 
size large enough to suggest that it 
might be practicable to eat it. 

Nanette at first rejected this sug- 
gestion with horror, for the critter 
was not pretty. It was a hard-shelled, 
reddish invertebrate which combined 
the best features — - or, from Nan- 
ette’s point of view, the worst — of a 
centipede and a scorpion. It even 
had a sting in its tail, suggesting 
that somewhere on Mars there were 
animals its own size, or larger, 
against which it might have to de- 
fend itself. It was a burrower, com- 
ing out only at dawn — which ex- 
plained why they hadn’t seen it be- 
fore — to feed on the mites and 
nematodes and harvest water from 
the lichens. It had twenty legs, mov- 
ed rapidly when the sun warmed 
it, and seemed to vary from about 
seven inches in length to nearly two 
feet. 

N anette’s verdict on this com- 
plex biological wonder, so 
beautifully adapted to its world, so 
recognizably obeying many of the 
evolutionary laws which prevailed 
on Earth, yet so obviously neither 
an Earthly creature nor related to 
any, was classic in its simplicity: 
“ Ugh." 

“Very ugh,” Dolph agreed. “But 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



101 




a real find, all the same. I’ll bet 
there’s a lot of meat in those claws 
and probably along the sides and 
back too — it’s need lots of muscles 
to run all those legs and make the 
tail strike as hard as it does.” The 
toe of his shoe carried a respectable 
slash to testify to the force with 
which the animal could drive its 
stinger. He suspected that the sting 
was venomous, too, but had ab- 
solutely no plans to test the theory. 

“Dolph Haertel, if you’re suggest- 
ing that we eat that thing, I’ll just 
leave you flat. Starving to death 
would be a lot better than — ugh!” 

“I’M bet you’ve eaten lots of 
things like it.” 

“I have not,” she said indignant- 
ly. 

“I seem to remember that you 
love crabmeat — especially from 
those huge Alaskan king crabs.” 

“Well — all right, yes, I do. But 
I don’t have to think about the crab 
while I eat it. Any more than I 
have to think about a pig when I’m 
eating bacon. This thing is differ- 
ent.” 

“Nanette, put your hand on your 
heart and swear to me solemnly 
that you have never, never eaten 
a broiled lobster straight out of the 
shell. Now look at our friend here. 
He could almost be a lobster if it 
weren’t for the extra legs. Isn’t it 
true?” 

Nanette looked stubborn. “I see 
what you mean,” she said, “I agree 
that there’s a likeness, I agree that 
the first time I ever saw a lobster I 
was horrified — I’ll admit anything 
you like. But I will not eat that 
monster.” 



“Well, I won’t insist,” Dolph said 
with a sight. “But I mean to try it. 
One thing that’s been worrying me 
is that our diet is awfully short on 
protein. This looks like a good 
source of it, if it’s edible at all. And 
I want to build up a lot of strength 
for summer. I’ve got a really major 
product I have to try — not just 
simply surviving, but actually try- 
ing to make things better.” 

“What is it?” 

“I want to climb up to the rim 
of the oasis.” 

“What on — on Mars for?” she 
said, aghast. “Why Dolph, that’s 
miles up — and no breathable air 
at the bottom, let alone at the top! 
It’d be like trying to climb Everest 
in your underwear!” 

“Not quite as bad as all that. 
Remember, I weigh much less here 
than I did at home, but I’ve still 
got the same muscles I had then — 
though I’ll have to be in better shape 
than I am now.” 

“But why?” 

“I want to set up some sort of 
simple radio jammer up there,” 
Dolph said earnestly. “Not to send 
any message, but something that 
might scramble or fuzz up that 
beacon we’ve been listening to. And 
loud enough so that the Martians — 
if that’s what we’re dealing with 
here — can pinpoint where it’s 
coming from.” 

“Great. We louse up their beacon, 
make them mad and give them our 
names and our zip code numbers. 
Then they eat us, and our troubles 
are over!” 

“It could happen that way. But 
I’m hoping they’ll be more curious 



102 



IF 




than angry. Remember, we don’t 
know a thing about them; we’re not 
even sure they exist. But if they 
do, I want to attract their attention. 
I think we have to. 

“In fact, I’m sure we have to. 
Nanette, we’ve been doing better 
at getting along on Mars than any- 
body could have expected. We’ve 
got good reason to be proud of our- 
selves. But it just isn’t good enough. 
One more bout of sickness — or 
some other accident, something we 
can’t even guess might happen now 
— and we’d be done for. 

“Somewhere up there, there just 
may be intelligent creatures who 
could help us, if we asked them to. 
And I’m going to, Nanette. We 
need help.” 

XI 

HIGH GROUND 

D esigning the jammer took con- 
siderable thought. It had to be 
simple (as did all their improvi- 
sations), portable and capable of put- 
ting out a lot of noise over a rela- 
tively long time. For power, Dolph 
decided, nothing would be a more 
suitable source than the wind. It 
would be erratic, true, but less so 
than an Earthly wind, and it would 
last longer than his device, which 
was more than could be said for 
any accumulator he might devise 
with the material at hand. 

He had no hope, of course, of 
matching the complexities of the 
Martian signal itself, but any spark 
that would produce a tearing burst 
of white noise across most of that 



band should prove quite annoying 
enough for his purposes — if anyone 
was listening at all, the sole hope 
behind the whole projeot. 

This time, furthermore, it could 
not be fragile — not only because 
he would not be around to service 
it if it broke down, or replace it if 
it gave up, but because he* had to 
climb the crater with it. During the 
course of that climb he could at 
best expect to knock it several times 
against one outcropping or another. 
At worst he might drop it — but 
nothing he could build could be 
safe against that kind of fall, de- 
spite the weak Martain gravity. His 
building materials were too close- 
ly limited to such stuff as coins, 
glass and old string, whereas rock 
was rock, even on Mars. 

The final product looked as gim- 
crack as all of his other construc- 
tions, but it was, bluntly, the best 
he and Nanette had been able to 
do. He thought it would serve. Es- 
sentially it was an anemometer 
which whirled one set of unevenly 
wound coils inside another, passed 
on the resulting power to a set of 
small sparking brushes which spun 
on the same shaft, and fed the sig- 
nal to an antenna which was one end 
of a mile-long spool of wire, the 
other end of which Dolph planned 
to throw over the cliff once he 
was at the top. The pole-pieces for 
the coils had been made by the 
brute-force method of pounding 
chunks of soft iron until they were 
magnetized enough to pick up nails. 

This Rube- Goldberg device 
packed into a frame about the size 
of a cigar box and weighed less 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTH RISE 



103 




than a pound. On test, even in the 
moderate winds of lihait oasis, it 
produced in the earphones a weak 
but strident whistle which varied in 
pitch with the wind velocity. Nan- 
ette (found the noise almost as un- 
nerving as the beacon whose opera- 
tors it was supposed to annoy, and 
heard together they produced a wail- 
ing the like of which had probably 
been heard before only by Dante. 
When they crossed they produced 
most satisfying bursts of white noise, 
unpredictably but frequently. 

“I’d hate to have to try to screen 
that out, even with a lot of equip- 
ment on tap,” Dolph said. “It’s so 
wobbly that the only sure way I 
can think of to deal with it is to 
pour on more power and drown 
it out — and if the integrity of 
their signal is important to them, 
those white spots will still annoy 
them over long distances.” 

“It seems like such a small nui- 
sance,” Nanette said. “Like a mosqui- 
to. It’s hard to believe they’ll notice 
it.” 

“The mosquito knocked out the 
Roman Empire,” Dolph said, “and 
if Gibbon had known that, think 
what a lot of writing it would have 
saved him! I hope we don’t do any- 
thing that drastic. Anyhow, the 
thing works. Now all we have to 
do is get it up to where they can 
hear it buzzing.” 

“That’s what scares me. Oh Dolph, 
take care of yourself!” 

“The very best,” Dolph said gent- 
ly. “You too. Starting now, with 
early-to-bed. You still need more 
rest than you’ve been getting, and 
I’m all packed and ready — I want 



to go as soon as the morning winds 
slack off.” 

“All right,” she said. For some 
reason, she seemed very dispirited, 
though she was trying hard not to 
show it. 

In the morning, however, just be- 
fore he donned his mask to leave 
the house, she stunned him by kiss- 
ing him good-bye. Up to know they 
had been very careful about even 
the tiniest of touches, much though 
they both often had needed them. 
Dolph could only touch her shoul- 
der briefly, jam the mask into place 
and blunder out — otherwise he 
would never have been able to 
leave at all. He thought it could 
only make everything from now on 
much harder. 

But in fact, he barely noticed the 
first five j hundred-odd feet of the 
climb to the crater’s rim. 

F ive hundred feet, however, is 
only about a tenth of a mile, 
and a mile was only half the dis- 
tance Dolph had to climb to reach 
the dreary tableland of the Martian 
desert. Two miles measured straight 
up; the amount of ground he would 
have to cover to get there might 
well add more than another. 

Nevertheless, it had to be climbed; 
and it was climbed. 

Except to experts in the sport, 
accounts of mountain climbs suffer 
from a certain sameness, devolving 
from the fact that one mountain is 
really much like another. It is this 
situation which drives novelists into 
enriching fictional climbs with 
Abominable Snowmen, mantichores, 
love triangles and other monsters

IF 




either irrelevant or mythological. 
Dolph encountered none of these, 
but his ascent was no duller or less 
desperate to him on that account; 
and besides, it was in many ways 
unique. 

Having to travel masked all the 
way was a grave disadvantage, but 
there were other aspects of the ter- 
rain which, he was surprised to find, 
worked to his advantage. One of 
these was that it was not in fact a 
mountain that he was climbing, but 
a hole blasted into once-level 
ground by a random astronomical 
missile. Hence he was not faced 
with sheer, plunging walls of hard 
granite, but with the rougher, softer 
limonite, which offered a surer foot- 
ing and many more handholds. Like 
the lunar ringwalls, the slope of the 
crater was relatively gentle. Like 
them, too, it was terraced, offering 
natural levels at which to stop for 
rest and food — indeed, most of the 
terraces were quite broad enough to 
sleep on without worrying about roll- 
ing over an edge; keeping himself 
from becoming frozen solid over- 
night, which he had expected to be, 
the most serious of his problems, 
solved itself when he discovered that 
if he lay down just before dusk, he 
quickly ^became the core of a sand 
dune inside which the only difficul- 
ty was in breathing. Fortunately he 
he did not need to breathe much. 
And unlike the lunar terraces, these 
were weathered, so that their ledges 
were rounded, and cloven by many 
irregular fissures worn by trickling 
sand. 

Also unlke the lunar terraces 
were the banks of rubble which con- 



nected these to each other: forma- 
tions called talus-slopes produced by 
the splitting of water-bearing rocks 
by alternate melting and freezing — 
a process called, poetically, exfolia- 
tion, because on Earth it happened in 
the autumn not long after die trees 
shed their leaves. There was not 
much water on Mars, but the melt- 
ing and refreezing required for ex- 
foliation happened eVery day, not 
just a few times a year. These long 
slides or j ambles were a mixed bless- 
ing, for although they offered easier 
grades than the rock slides of the 
terraces themselves, they were also 
slippery. After being nearly buried 
by one after a flailing tumble back 
to its base, Dolph tackled them ©oly 
with ant-Jike caution and climbed 
fissures or chimneys instead where- 
ever possible. 

G eology — or areology, if that 
was what he had to call it here 
— had another such trap in store 
for him. Limonite is not as crumb- 
ly as sandstone, but it is not very 
cohesive, either. He found this out 
the hard way as he was heaving him- 
self up over the rim of a terrace, 
when an outcropping moved under 
his hand and turned into an in- 
dependent boulder the size of a bar- 
rel. Feeling it move under his grip 
was a sickening sensation, but a 
frantic lunge and scramble brought 
him safely over the edge. 

Safety? After a moment he was 
not so sure. Pausing to recover his 
breath and his nerve, he watched 
the boulder fall and was immediate- 
ly afraid that the danger had only 
transformed itself into another guise. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



105 




The Wg rook fell slowly, but the 
weakness of Martian gravity had not 
changed its mass any. When it next 
strode the side of the crater, it 
bounced high, and two companions 
were tumbling in its wake. Though 
the slowness of the process was al- 
most dreamlike, it did not seem to 
take very long for it to chum its 
way into a sizeable avalanche — and 
below it, seeming directly in its 
path, was the shack, looking from 
this height as small and fragile as 
two kitchen match-boxes. 

Gradually, however, the terraces 
intercepted more and more of the 
sliding masses of rocks. When the 
dust finally settled and he could 
again see die floor of the oasis, the 
match-boxes were still there, with no 
motion visible anywhere near them. 
It was more than possible that Nan- 
ette had never even been aware of 
the danger, unless she had happened 
to have been looking up after him 
during the past few minutes, for 
the slide had not been heavy enough 
to shake the ground and, in this thin 
air, had been virtually soundless. 

In addition, he could see that his 
climb had taken him at an angle 
away from a direct line down to the 
shack, so that even had the avalanche 
struck the crater floor, it probably 
would have missed Nanette by sev- 
eral hundred feet. All the same, the 
near-disaster made him even more 
cautious of his hand-holds, and his 
route still more indirect; which had 
the effect of slowing him down still 
further. 

And then, incredibly — for it now 
seemed to him that he would go on 
climbing forever, as he had always 



been climbing — he topped one 
more crumbling ridge, and the high 
desert stretched out before him, 
glowing and still in late afternoon 
sunlight. 

Despite its stillness, it seemed to 
his dazzled eyes to be moving, in 
some subtle way he could not quite 
understand. There was no wind, and 
nowhere even a feather pf cloud 
— only the dunes, long frozen ripples 
that told of motion past and move- 
ment still to come. But by some odd- 
ity of the light, the tilted steppes 
seemed to be burning, as gently and 
inexorably as though the very 
atoms of the ancient sands were de- 
caying into cold light before his 
eyes. A tinge of brilliant, almost 
electric blue in the light made the 
usual rusty color of the sand seem 
almost brown, and the puddles of 
shadow so like ink-blots as to seem 
almost liquid, especially those made 
sharper and smaller by distance. 

H e looked up. Except near the 
sun, the sky was as usual dark 
enough to show quite a few stars; 
but even at its blackest, the blue 
tinge was there. The whole sky 
looked as though it had been made 
from a spill of “washable” ink 
which had paled a little around the 
sun and the stars — not a proper 
heaven at all, but a dome of stained 
crystal, pierced here and there to 
let in celestial fires which burned 
not very far 'beyond it. 

Bemused, Dolph remembered at 
once a famous medieval woodcut of 
a man who, having reached the hori- 
zon of a flat world, had broken 
through the crystal of the sky where 



106 



IF 




it touched the ground and now 
stared in wonder beyond the sphere 
of stars at those prime movers — 
great wheels and other engines — 
which kept all the inner, Aristotelian 
spheres turning against their hack- 
drop of eternally twinkling flames. 
Though he knew that even the artist 
had not seen the matter so simply 
— that, indeed, the woodcut had 
been intended only to symbolize 
what a philosopher might do only 
in his mind, but no man ever in 
his physical person — Dolph felt 
for a long moment as though the 
primum mobile might well lie and 
turn just beyond this close, utterly 
unEarthly horizon, which he had 
only to cross the desert to touch . 

And even to hope to touch it 
would be death. This was the high 
desert of Mars, a terrible vision of 



dry and eternal winter, in mid- 
spring as always. No man would 
ever cross it except as part of a 
fully equipped expedition — or, by 
himself, in a carefully designed ve- 
hicle supported (and, when neces- 
sary, succored) by the entire re- 
sources of an elaborate, Mars-based, 
Earth-supplied technology. For 
Dolph, that tempting glass horizon 
was as unattainable as Barth itself. 

Thus brought back with a thump 
to the realities, he set about un- 
packing his device. But he could not 
help wondering about the light. Evi- 
dentally this was one of those rare 
days of “blue clearing,*' when the 
atmosphere of Mars, usually as 
opaque to blue light as all atmos- 
pheres are, had suddenly -become 
transparent to the shorter wave- 
lengths of the visible spectrum. The 




THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



107 




effect had often been noticed — 
even photographed — on Earth. 

All very well, except that as an 
explanation, it didn’t explain. Here 
on the spot, he could no more guess 
what caused “blue clearing” than 
could Earth’s astronomers. But the 
effect was certainly striking; in fact, 
it was downright eerie, like a land- 
scape remembered from a nightmare. 

The jammer seemed to have suf- 
fered no damage during the climb. 
Finding a shelter for the machine 
which would protect it from the 
sand — without at the same time 
shielding off a part of its output by 
the iron-rich rock — was out of the 
question, and in any case would have 
defeated the whole purpose of his 
climb. The anemometer cups had to 
be out in the open, preferably as 
high up as possible. He settled even- 
tually upon a sharp rise with a flat, 
mesalike top, on which he anchored 
the device with heavy rocks — not 
nearly as heavy for their size as he 
could have wished — upon its base 
flanges. The cups were already ro- 
tating in the rising breeze of eve- 
ning, and an earphone check showed 
that the complex signal was being 
generated as strongly as before. 

The last move was to throw the 
aerial reel over the lip of the crater. 
Since the floor was already a well 
of night, he lost track of the spool 
quickly and so could not tell whether 
it had unreeled all the way, or had 
become arrested on some terrace. 

Well, that oould be checked easily 
during the climb down, simply by 
following the aerial wire as a route- 
marker. But that was for tomorrow 
morning. Dolph made camp and, 



for the rest of the evening, watched 
the Earth set after the Sun behind 
the glass horizon, until it grew too 
cold for him to stay outside his pup- 
tent any longer. 

T he return was in many respects 
harder than the climb up — 
in part because he had now to be 
looking down much of the way, and 
in part because the route laid out 
for him by the aerial wire had been 
chosen by gravity without regard for 
such human conveniences as hand- 
holds. Experience, however, steered 
him around the worst traps and 
troubles, so that in the long run he 
managed to make the journey a 
little faster than he had made the 
ascent. 

But when he got back to the 
shack, he found Nanette ill again. 

Not seriously, no. Much of it, 
obviously, was simply the product 
of loneliness and suppressed fear, 
and within hours of his return she 
was almost her old self again. 

Nevertheless, it was dear that 
he could never again dare to leave 
the oasis by himself . nor did 
his memory of the high ground give 
him any reason to think that they 
could dream of crossing it, even 
together. For better or for worse, 
this was where the line ended.

“THEY ARE NOT DEAD!” 

I n the Arctic lands of Earth, spring 
is so bitter and summer so short 
that the ground only a few feet be- 
low the surface never thaws. This 



108 



IF 




iron-hard layer is called the perma- 
frost; and it was something much 
like this relentless stratum that the 
Haertels and the Fords had long 
since struck in their attempts to res- 
cue their children. 

The trouble lay partly, of course, 
in the distances involved — and not 
only in their sheer size, but in the way 
they fluctuated, which in turn af- 
fected the time lapses between years 
when a flight to Mars looked even 
slightly feasible at all. In an era 
when spaceflight of a sort had been 
a fact for more than two decades, 
the Moon at a quarter of a million 
miles away seemed to be nearly in 
Earth’s back yard to people who 
thought about the matter at all, 
though nobody had set foot on it 
yet; but Mars — though there were 
plans, on paper, to go there — still 
seemed quite a different matter. The 
48-million-mile gap between the two 
planets still looked vast to begin 
with, and on closer examination it 
also turned out to be a fiction — it 
was only a mean distance, not a 
real one, and the actual abyss a 
spaceship would have to span on 
such a journey was never going to 
be less than eight times as far — at 
least not as long as “spaceships” 
meant “rockets” — since the desti- 
nation like ' the home port, is al- 
ways in motion and must be chased. 

Nevertheless, those paper plans 
to go there did exist, and several un- 
manned vehicles, beginning with 
Mariner 4 in 1965, had paid the 
little planet visits of sorts. The real 
barrier was the permafrost that lies 
beneath the surface of all large 
governments, no matter what name 



they go by: layer after frozen layer 
of official indifference to any pro- 
ject not dose to home in some way, 
and not likely to pay off — in votes, 
in prestige or simply in color — 
during the effective lifetime of the 
officeholder who might be in a po- 
sition to do something about it. 
There was no deliberate cruelty he- 
hind that indifference, only a kind 
of practicality which was .worse than 
cruelty in its confessed and deliberate 
short-sightedness. 

F our bereft taxpayers in Iowa 
were in no position to thaw 
such a glacier. Not that the families’ 
long and determined campaign had 
made no impression whatsoever. The 
case of the Children in the Sky, 
though it had been out of the news 
for more than a year and was con- 
sidered closed, had left a lasting 
memory trace. Indeed, one widely 
syndicated columnist had even ob- 
served its anniversary by demanding 
to know what the government was 
doing — though he knew the an- 
swer well enough and was asking 
only because embarrassing the ad- 
ministration was his stock in trade. 

And the campaign had left them 
with at least one official friend: 
Garth Marshall, the research direc- 
tor of A. O. LeFebre et Cie., a 
huge industrial complex which sub- 
contracted rocket stages, solid pro- 
pellants and many more highly se- 
cret objects to NASA and the De- 
partment of Defense. The fact that 
a LeFebre subsidiary was building 
about half the hardware for Pro- 
ject Ares was probably irrevelant. 
The additional fact that Dr. Mar- 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTH RISE 



109 




shall had once been a suitor of Mrs. 
Haertel’s may have had more bear- 
ing on his support. Whatever the 
reason, that support was whole- 
hearted, and neither the Haertels nor 
the Fords were in any state of mind 
to question its motives. 

But Dr. Marshall had thus far 
been unable to budge NASA a centi- 
meter. 

“It’s the same old story,” he 
told a family conference — the lat- 
est of dozens, all equally fruitless and 
becoming steadily gloomier. “We 
haven’t been able to do anything 
on the Ares components thus far 
(I’m not supposed to be telling you 
this, of course) but make refine- 
ments here and there. Strictly frills 
and furbelows. They may add some 
reliability to the mission eventually, 
but they don’t do a thing toward 
getting it off the ground.” 

“It’s still the question of timing, 
then,” Mr. Ford said. The Haertels 
had met him only once before .the 
disaster; he had struck them then 
as an amiable non-entity. Since then, 
he had somehow simultaneously be- 
come both grayer and more force- 
ful. 

“Yes, I’m afraid so,” Garth Mar- 
shall said grimly. “With the time- 
table for the Apollo program in the 
same old shambles, NASA is hav- 
ing enough trouble getting contin- 
uing funds for a Moon landing. 
Even just plain talk about any 
manned expedition to Mars now 
comes back labeled ‘premature.’ 
And the Soviets won’t budge with- 
out our cooperation — naturally 
enough, since they’ll be asked to 
provide all of the orbital-assembly 



phase, which is where the really 
heavy stuff is called for. They don’t 
want to spend the money if all we’ve 
got for them to boost is one glider 
and a flock of empty nose-cones.” 
“Premature!” Mr. Haertel said. 
It might just as well have been a 
swear-word. 

“But what’s that got to do with 
anything?” Mrs. Ford said. “I don’t 
want to go to the Moon, Doctor 
Marshall. I don’t see why anybody 
would want to go there. We only 
want to get Nanette back, and 
Dolph. Why can’t they help us?” 
Mrs. Haertel, who had followed 
Dr. Marshall’s account all too well, 
put out her hand to the other wom- 
an, who grasped it blindly. There 
was a painful silence. 

CC'T^hey don’t care about the 
A children,” Mrs. Haertel said. 
“It’s not their fault that they don’t. 
They’re not their Children.” 

“No,” Dr. Marshall agreed. 
“And besides . well, if NASA 
ever believed that the kids were on 
Mars — which I’m not entirely sure 
they did — they don’t feel any pres- 
sure to rescue them now. They 
think that Dolph and Nanette are 
dead. I’ve tried hard to sell Ares 
as a rescue mission, and I’ve failed 
utterly. It’s just too late for that.” 
“But they aren’t!” Mrs. Haertel 
cried. “Garth — they got to Mars 
before anyone else. Doesn’t that 
count for something? Isn’t it stupid 
to think that they could do that, 
and yet not be able to take care 
of themselves when they got there?” 
“It might have been a fluke,” Dr. 
Marshall said, very gently. “Dolph’s 



110 



IF 




basic discovery certainly must have 
been a major accident. I’ve got a 
man in my lab who’s worked out a 
really colossal infringement of rela- 
tivity, derived just from the bare 
knowledge that Dolph had some 
kind of anti-gravity, and nothing 
more — not from any knowledge of 
what Dolph actually did, because 
nobody has that. It might well give 
us a breakthrough to some kind of 
ion drive, something that might 
shorten a crossing to Mars by near- 
ly three months. But I’m sure it 
isn’t more than remotely related to 
Dolph’s work. Everybody in the 
world is stuck for the most elemen- 
tary explanation of that. And . 
we know that Dolph took off for 
Mars too soon, before he’d properly 
stopped to think about what a 
dreadful desert the planet is. Nan- 
ette left even more precipitiously; 
she may never have reached Mars 
at all. They’ve already worked one 
miracle. Two is a lot to hope for 
— more than I can sell, anyhow. 
We have to face up to that.” 

“Do you think that?” Mr. Ford 
said. 

“I . ” Dr. Marshall fell silent 
and put two fingers to his brow, 
as though something ached above 
his eyes. At last he said: 

“I’ve studied Mars for many years. 
My company’s spent millions of dol- 
lars trying to work out ways for 
human beings to live there — skilled 
adults, backed up by lots of highly 
specialized equipment. How two 
teen-agers could last one day on that 
planet, I do not know. I simply do 
not know.” 

“But you’ll go on helping us, 



Garth, won’t you?” Mrs. Haertel 
said steadily. 

“Yes, Doris, of course I will. I'm 
just forced not to be very hopeful, 
that’s all.” 

Mrs. Ford burst into tears, but 
almost they seemed to be tears of 
relief. Dolph’s stepfather stood up. 
He looked unexpectedly tall.- 
“There’s got to be some way,” 
he said. “Garth, I don’t care what 
any of the other problems are. 
There’s bound to be a way around 
them, if we stick them out. But 
as far as the children are concerned, 
of one thing I’m absolutely sure: 
They are not dead ” 

Dr. Marshall stood up also. “I’ll 
go now,” he said. “And I’ll keep 
trying. If I can sell somebody our 
ion drive . well, that remains 
to be seen. LeFebre can be as hard 
to move as NASA — one of the 
penalties of size. But in the mean- 
time — no, dammit, I quite agree 
with you. They are not dead. I 
know it. They can’t be, that’s all.” 
His face stormy, he stomped out. 
The meeting was over. It was still 
as gloomy as all its predecessors 
had been; but it was not yet des- 
pairing. Not yet. Not quite. 

O nce back in his office. Dr. Mar- 
shall locked the door, inter- 
dicted all incoming calls and care- 
fully constructed a bombshell. Prob- 
ably, he thought, it would do noth- 
ing but destroy his job, his security 
clearance and his career, but he 
considered that the time was now 
past for half measures. The bomb- 
shell might also, of course, turn 
out to be a dud. On the whole, he

was sure he would prefer almost 
any sort of explosion, now.

Re: Booster Program — 

Prime Mover Section 

Your attention is called to the 
relativity discontinuity recently dis- 
covered by Dr. Lloyd McCann of our 
staff (v. Nature , whole no. 5463; 
LeFebre Tech. Publ. 1094; unpub- 
lished memo, ARES D-968). 

Briefly and non-mathematically, 
this discontinuity (which we are 
calling the McCann Effect for short, 
over Dr. McCann’s objections) im- 
plies that gravity is a function of 
the weaker and still unnamed 
‘fourth force’, and as such can vary 
independently of Lorenz-Fitzgerald 
mass variation. The pertinent field 
equations also suggest that gravity 
has polarity under certain condi- 
tions, none of which appear to be 
duplicatable experimentally. 

While the Effect has large im- 
plications in cosmology and other 
theoretical fields, immediate inter- 
est attaches to its possibilities as an 
adjunct tp rocket vehicle design. 

Suggestions are invited as to ways 
of applying the Effect to the reac- 
tion mass, jet flow or (possibly) 
payload of a space vessel, either 
chemical or ionic. As there ap- 
pears to be no present active NASA 
interest in Project Ares or other 
trans-lunar operations, the Geneva 



office will perhaps wish to explore 
the possibility of technical consulta- 
tion with British, French, Israeli 
and Soviet contacts. Needless to say, 
such explorations should be kept on 
a strictly scientific basis. 

Please post. 

GARTH MARSHALL 

And that, perhaps, was that: 
either the beginning of a marvel — 
or the end of two lives, and possibly 
three. Time, as usual, would have 
to tell. 

T he dark cold sleep of perma- 
frost was also on Dolph’s mind, 
though in a considerably more dir- 
ect sense. Frustrated even in his 
hopes of quitting the crater for high 
ground, he had turned defiantly in 
the opposite direction: straight down. 

He was hoping, in fact, to dig 
himself and Nanette a water mine. 

He was from the beginning al- 
most sure that such a project was 
feasible, the only important quali- 
fication being how deeply he would 
have to dig before the sands de- 
feated his efforts to hold them back. 
There was, after all, much more 
water on Mars than the most opti- 
mistic scientific estimates had haz- 
arded — not only enough to cover 
thousands of square miles of one 
Martian pole with hoarfrost (or 
perhaps even snow), but also 
enough to account for all the water 
in the bladders of the tumble- 
lichens; an attempt to calculate how 
much that added up to gave him a 
figure which was incredibly in the 
millions of gallons. 

Obviously the source of so mu cl 
water could not be on the planets 



112 




surface. Far one thing, sun high- 
lights would flash off it, which 
would have been visible from Earth, 
whereas in a solid century of ob- 
servation since Schiaparelli nobody 
had even seen one. For another, any 
open body of ice in this thin air 
would sublime — that is, pass direct- 
ly from the solid state into water 
vapor, without intermediate melting. 
Most of it would remain permanent- 
ly as finely divided ice crystals in 
the uppermost reaches of the at- 
mosphere, and the rest would join 
the hoarfrost at one pole or the 
other in winter. 

The conclusion was inescapable: 
There had to be ice underground, 
in considerable quantity — perhaps 
not just a layer of permafrost, but 
a whole geological stratum, a sort 
of “aquasphere” hundreds of feet 
thick: 

They found it within a week of 
digging. It was not much more than 
fifteen feet beneath the shifting sur- 
face of the crater — which now 
could be called an oasis in all ac- 
curacy, for obviously the aquasphere 
would be totally inaccessible from 
the high desert without the most 
elaborate of drilling rigs. 

They shored, shielded and roof- 
ed the short shaft with the few 
boards left over from the leanto 
project, filling in the gaps with home- 
made paperboard. The result was 
reasonably strong where it had to 
be and kept out enough wind-blown 
sand to keep the hole from filling, 
although its bottom had to be shov- 



eled regularly. They alternated at 
that task and at the daily chore of 
cutting and fetching ice-blocks. The 
near water supply took a great deal 
of wear off the wine-press, which 
now needed to be used only for the 
extraction of the all-important elixir. 

They found, too, that die well 
unexpectedly simplified the job of 
hunting the scorpion4ike creatures 
(which tasted absolutely nothing 
like lobster, but were not unpleasant 
to eat, and were inarguably nutri- 
tious); the scuttling beasts took ad- 
vantage of the exposed ice layer for 
their own watering, and there were 
always two or three of them half 
buried in the sand-cover atop it in 
the early morning. 

B ut the well proved abruptly to 
have another attraction that was 
a good deal less welcome. 

Nanette discovered it and re- 
turned one morning without the ice- 
cake she had gone for and with her 
eyes wide behind her mask. She 
did not need to say a word; she 
simply beckoned, and that and her 
expression were enough. His slowed 
heart thudding, Dolph followed her 
out. 

The crude trap that they had built 
for the ugly arthropods was broken 
and empty. Around it in the shel- 
tered sand were half a dozen broad, 
regular markings about the size of 
a pie-tin. Most of them were blurred, 
but one was quite clear and sharp. 

It was the print of a heavy, five- 
toed paw. 



CONCLUDED NEXT MONTH 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTH RISE

IF • Short Story 



HE LOOKED BACK 

by CARL JACOBI 



Mr. Smith made the mistake of 
Lot's wife — and suffered the 
same punishment for his act! 



F irst of all, Elsie, I want to thank 
you for getting me this job. 
When I first met you in Porto Var- 
gas I don’t mind telling you now I 
was down to my last twenty. Oh, my 
tour was paid for and the boat had 
made its last stop before returning to 
New York. But I had been careless 
buying souvenirs and things and . 
well, a girl can’t go around without 
money in her purse. 

I like it here. San Carlo is a beau- 
tiful little country, even if it is run 
by a dictator. And Rodosa is a pretty 
town, although I would like it better 
if it were nearer the coast instead of 
way up here in the mountains. But 
then the weather wouldn’t be so nice, 
and one can’t have everything, I 
suppose. 

Just as you said, I’m living in the 
hotel — Antenida, they call it — and I 



really have two jobs in one. I op- 
erate the desk switchboard (lucky 
I told you I had phone experience 
and fortunate too I brushed up on 
my Spanish last winter) and I serve 
as public stenographer occasionally 
in my spare time. 

Right now there aren’t many 
guests here as it’s sort of between 
seasons, but in a month or so Presi- 
dent Solera will stop in on this reg- 
ular hunting vacation and then, I’m 
told, the place will really be jumping. 

We do have one VIP. His name is 
Captain Juan La Cola, and he drove 
up in a gorgeous sport model Cith- 
edra-Ole that was about a mile long, 
bumper to bumper. He is a tall man, 
swarthy, with a beard no amount of 
shaving can completely remove, and 
he wears high boots and a belted 
tunic with the mark of the Confiden- 



114 




tial Police on the collar. I was stand- 
ing next to the room clerk when he 
signed the register and I couldn’t 
help seeing his signature. And would 
you believe it, the National Identity 
Number he wrote after his name was 
137 . 

Imagine me being in the same 
hotel with a one-thirty-seven. The 
closest I’ve ever come to important 
people is a twelve thousand, a su- 
preme court judge, seventy years 
old. Of course that was a Norte 
American NIN, but even so. 

Well, this Juan La Gola asked if 
I’d take a letter for him, and I did, 
and then he said I should come up 
and see him in an hour or so when 
he got settled, for more typing. 
Meanwhile he was expecting a pack- 
age and wanted it delivered to his 
room as soon as it arrived. 

Did he say package? It was a 
wooden crate, five feet square, and 
so heavy it had to go up the freight 
elevator. It had a lot of foreign seals 
plastered to its sides, but I couldn’t 
read any of them. 

After an hour I went up to the 
fifth floor and rang his bell. No one 
answered, but the door was partially 
open, so I went in. The crate had 
been opened, the boards stacked in 
a corner. In the center of the room 
on the table was a brand new dream 
machine. 

It wasn’t like any dreamer I’d ever 
seen, and I’ve seen a lot of them. 
It had three instrument panels in- 
stead of one, and mounted on the 
center one was a thing that looked 
like an enlarged hour glass with 
black powder running from one 
chamber to the other. It had a shiny 



disc, tipped sideways between two 
olendrons that slowly changed col- 
ors, from red to blue to yellow and 
back to red again. There was a sound 
chamber too somewhere, and out of 
it came a clickety clack like a far- 
away train. 

Sprawled on the bed at the * far 
side of the room lay Captain La 
Gola, fully dressed even tQ his boots. 
He was asleep. A single wire trailed 
across the floor from the dreamer 
and divided into plugs in his ears. 

I made a noise but he went right 
on sleeping. I stood there uncertain- 
ly, then moved across to a chair. I 
knew it disturbed some persons, to 
be wakened suddenly while under 
the effects of a dreamer, and I 
thought I’d wait a few moments and 
then, if he didn’t awake, leave and 
come back later. 

Now fleeting images took form in 
sepia on the titled disc, to be fol- 
lowed by a series of postcard-like 
views of places I had never seen be- 
fore. But all was in caricature with 
exaggerated detail and blurred back- 
ground. After a while it came to me. 
The scenes must be the visual re- 
production of the Captain’s dream 
while he slept. Never had I seen a 
dreamer with a sight attachment! 

The whirlagig changes continued, 
then held on what seemed to be the 
interior of a train. At the same time 
the clickety clack from the sound 
chamber grew louder. A group of 
officers in the uniform of Solera’s 
DEP Guards swam into view as they 
sat about a table in a train coach. 
Briefly the features of one officer 
after another appeared in close-up 
on the disc. 



HE LOOKED BACK 



115 




Then the scream of a train whistle 
sounded. It was repeated again and 
again. Wheels screeched, steel 
ground against steel as the brakes 
were applied. An instant later there 
was a muffled crash, the sound of 
breaking glass and agonized cries. 
The last scene on the disc became 
immobile. 

Across the room Captain La Gola 
sat up on the bed, blinking his eyes. 
There was a little smile of satisfac- 
tion on his lips as he removed the 
wire-connected plugs from his ears. 
Seeing me, he nodded and got to his 
feet, buttoning his tunic. 

“You said something about more 
letters ...” I said. 

“Yes . .” He strode across the 
room, looked out the window. “Yes 
. .” Then he began to dictate: 
“Don Carlos Proportoy Riaz, Casa 
Republica, Ventriago. Senor: The 
Government will require a thousand 
head of prime beef cattle by the first 
of the month. You will see that ship- 
ment is made to Porto Vargas with- 
out delay. Failure to meet these de- 
mands will result in your wife’s and 
daughter’s immediate transportation 
to the retention camp at Los Tobel- 
los.” 

“And the signature . ?” I said as 
he finished talking. 

He smiled again. “Juan La Gola, 
132.” 

“Yes, Elsie, he said one-thirty- 
two.” 

Talk has died down now, and I 
guess we all can breathe a little 
easier. But while it lasted the con- 
fusion over the wreck of the Sonora 
Express had the hotel in an uproar. 
The death of five of its most im- 



portant officers, to say nothing of 
the many lesser fry, was hard for the 
Government to take. Confidential 
Police were all over the place, ask- 
ing questions, checking alibis, which 
was to be expected, I suppose, since 
the wreck occurred only 48 kilom- 
eters — 30 miles — from here. 

They even questioned me, which 
was absurd, for what would I know 
about a train wreck; unless I told 
them about what I had seen on the 
dreamer in Captain La Gpla’s room. 
But that was three days before the 
wreck; and besides a dream is only 
a dream. If Captain La Gola wants 
to report the matter, I figure he can 
do it himself. 

I had to do an extra stint on the 
switchboard last night. Consuela, the 
night girl, went home ill. Before she 
left she said, “If Captain La Gola 
should make any middle-distance 
calls, put him through to operator 5 
on C circuit.” 

I didn’t know what she meant by 
middle-distance calls, and C circuit 
is an unconnected part of the switch- 
board with no outside lines at all. 

But a moment after she had gone, 
I examined the board and I saw that 
C circuit did have a new plug and a 
new outlet, and there was sawdust 
on the floor where installation work- 
men had left traces of their work. 
I thought it queer that Mr. Alverez, 
the manager, had not informed me 
of changes in the board, but Mr. 
Alverez is always so busy I decided 
he must have forgotten about it. 

Just at midnight Captain La 
Gola’s line lit up, and I plugged him 
in. 

“Consuela?” 



116 



IF 




“No,” T said. “This is Jennie. Con- 
suela is sick.” 

There was a moment of silence. 
“Look, Jennie, as a representative 
of the government I found it neces- 
sary to have certain additions made 
to your switchboard. Can I rely on 
you to say nothing about it to any- 
body?” 

“Of course,” I said. I was still 
disturbed by that letter he had dic- 
tated in his room; but the more I 
thought about it, the more it seemed 
a routine harmless official threat. 
Of course I really know nothing 
about governmental procedures of 
this kind. 

“Good,” Captain La Gola said. 
“Now put me through on the new 
circuit.” 

I called Operator 5, as Consuela 
had told me, and she answered; and 
then a lot of queer things began to 
happen. 

“Operator 5, this is Antenida 756- 
28. Have you an open line?” 

“Go ahead, please.” 

I switohed in the captain. “Okay, 
Sir.” 

Immediately a Donald Duck chat- 
ter began, which meant the captain 
had switched in a scrambler at his 
end. The voice of Operator 5 came 
on again. 

“I am taking your call, Antenida 
756-28. Interspace distance, please 
relay.” 

An amplifying hum sounded, fol- 
lowed by a burst of static. Then a 
far-off voice spoke, 

“This is Cliedes 4. We are relay- 
ing.” 

Another burst of static. “Rentar- 
ion-south. We are relaying. To Jan- 



ison Sphere. We have a polerated 
call for you from Antenida 756-28.” 

“This is Janison Sphere. Go 
ahead.” 

The Donald Duck began to chatter 
again, and a scrambler now came in 
at the other end. I sat there, listen- 
ing to the meaningless high cycle. 
But presently it ended, and the light 
above Captain La Gola’s plug 
winked off. 

Well, I asked myself, what was 
that all about? I was still thinking 
about it when I went off duty. 

After that I began to do more 
and more work for the captain. One 
day he dictated twelve letters. I 
didn’t like the tone of those letters 
and I didn’t like him. He was all 
spit and polish. He wore a plaited 
holster at his waist, and in it was 
one of those new logmetic revolvers. 
He knew how to use the weapon too. 
I was on the veranda one morning 
when he took up a position at the far 
end and calmly drew and fired at 
one of the hanging medallions that 
ornament the sun blinds. There was 
no sound, only an almost imper- 
ceptible tracer of lavender, and the 
medallion flew into a hundred 
pieces. 

“Progress,” he said to me with a 
little smile. “Even in San Carlo the 
science of defense has come a long 
way.” 

Well, you know me, Elsie. Cur- 
iosity may have killed the cat, but it’s 
always been a part of my makeup. 
I got to thinking about Captain La 
Gola’s dreamer and how he’d 
jumped his NIN number backward 
before the wreck of the Sonora Ex- 
press and the death of those five of- 



HE LOOKED BACK 



117 




ficers, and I decided I wanted an- 
other look. So I waited until the 
captain had gone into town and then 
I took the key and let myself into 
his room. The first thing I looked 
at was the drawer of his desk and 
there I hit the jackpot right away. 
There was a book in that drawer, a 
military manual, and between its 
pages was a folded-up typewritten 
list and that list contained the names 
of men prominent in San Carlo gov- 
ernmental and military affairs — I 
had read a lot of them in the news- 
paper from time to time — and after 
each name there was a number 
through 136 and a line had been 
drawn through the last names. Other 
names were marked, some with a 
check, some with a star, some with 
a question mark. 

I put the list back in the book and 
the book back in the drawer and 
turned to the dreamer which still 
stood on the table in the center of 
the room. The dials on one of the 
panels looked about the same as 
those on my little second-hand ma- 
chine back in Iowa, but the calibra- 
tions were not in English or Span- 
ish or in any language I knew. The 
disc in which I had seen — the visual 
reproduction of Captain La Gola’s 
dream still showed that last frozen 
scene of the train interior from that 
dream. 

I turned to the stacked pile of 
boards from the dismantled packing 
case which still stood along one wall 
of the room. Stenciled on one of the 
boards was apparently a return ad- 
dress: 

Janison Production Assembly 

Janison Sphere — Terberon Galaxy 



Teleport Station Number 5 

At that moment I heard steps in 
the outer corridor. I knew if I were 
caught I’d have plenty of trouble ex- 
plaining my presence. I eased open 
the connecting door to the adjoin- 
ing room, slipped in and waited until 
I heard the adjacent hall door open. 
Then I went out into the corridor 
and made my way back to the lift. 
I hadn’t been seen, but I had seen 
things that disturbed me. 

That night Captain La Gola again 
asked to be connected to the new 
circuit and again the call went 
through with surprising speed and 
facility. He had his scrambler on but 
I couldn’t see .that he needed it, so 
loud was the static amplification 
drone. The call was over almost be- 
fore it began, and the only thing I 
could understand was a voice that 
came on just before ring-off. It was 
a cold brittle voice, and it said, “It 
is decided then. The twelfth, accord- 
ing to your calendar.” 

Naturally, Elsie, I didn’t say any- 
thing about those calls, but when 
Mr. Alverez, the manager, came in- 
to the office, I spoke to him about 
the switchboard. He seemed nervous 
and anxious to avoid the subject. He 
said, 

“Yes, I know. Just keep on with 
your work as before. And if you 
want to, you can take the morning 
off tomorrow and go to the fiesta in 
San Medro. The bus leaves at nine 
a. m.” 

Which I thought was pretty nice 
of him, especially since I’ve been 
here only two months. On the bus 
I thought for a moment I saw Cap- 
tain La Gola sitting alone just in 



118 



IP 




back of the driver. But it must have 
been someone else for this man was 
in mufti and he neither looked 
around or spoke to anyone during 
the entire trip. 

San Medro is a delightful town 
with a lovely old church at one end 
of the single crooked street and the 
market place at the other. The fies- 
ta, or rather fair, was charming. I 
bought a tecinta neck scarf and one 
of those spangled oncero hats, and 
I drank so much chocolate I thought 
I would get sick. 

There’s an observatory at San 
Medro, and according to the post- 
cards in the shops it has a scope with 
a mirror twenty feet in diameter. 
I thought it would be interesting to 
see even in daytime when observa- 
tion was of course impossible. So I 
walked up the long cedar-lined trail 
and climbed about twenty flights of 
steps, but I might as well stayed at 
the fair. The front of the observatory 
and the walk that encircled it bris- 
tled with soldiers, all armed to the 
teeth, and every few yards machine 
guns had been set up, covering the 
road below. There was absolutely 
no admittance. In back of the obser- 
vatory a kind of shelf had been 
hacked out of the hillside and a big 
wooden wall had been erected as if 
to hide something from the people of 
the town. 

There was a large door in the side 
of this wall, and it opened while I 
stood there arguing with the guards. 
I had only a fleeting glimpse of what 
was inside but I did see a massive 
steel framework with criss-cross 
braces. The area around the block 
house — I took it for a black house — 



swarmed with federal troops. And 
when I went back to the bus stop 
more soldiers had set up large camp 
tables and were questioning all civ- 
ilians who were made to queue up 
and file by them. 

“Somebody declare war?” I said 
to one of the uniformed men. He 
didn’t smile and I didn’t realize at 
the time how near the truth I was. 

The bus ride back to Rodosa was 
restful, and after my climb to the ob- 
servatory I was content to sit in the 
sloping seat and doze, occasionally 
opening my eyes to watch the rocky 
scenery slide by. We were five miles 
out of San Medro when the explos- 
ion sounded behind us, a muffled 
thump as if a great container of 
water had fallen from a height. An 
instant later the shock wave hit! a 
window in the bus shattered, and the 
road in front seemed to stagger mo- 
mentarily. 

But I really didn’t know what had 
happened for two days.Jt took that 
long for the garbled story to straight- 
en itself out and by that time the 
significance of it had tapered off 
somewhat. It was still mighty big 
news. A Coronado interception 
missile had blown up in its cradle 
just outside San Medro. More than 
thirty officers and men had been 
killed. Rodoso was in an uproar. 
Concern of the people was not only 
over the explosion but for the reason 
behind the presence of the missile. 
Why had it been brought there to 
this little town far up in the moun- 
tains? Was the exploding of it an act 
of sabotage? If so, what persons 
were responsible? 

The confusion lasted a week. 



HE LOOKED BACK 



119 




Gradually things began to return to 
normalcy. Rumors passed on, and 
the wild (talk subsided. 

And then like an anti-climax Pres- 
ident Solera marched in with his en- 
tourage and took over the entire 
twelfth floor. The switchboard lit 
up like a Christmas tree as the oc- 
cupants of the rooms made outside 
calls or demanded room-service. 

To make matters worse, Consuela 
was taken sick again, and I had to do 
four hours of the night trick. At a 
quarter to twelve the outside line on 
the new C circuit suddenly lit. I 
plugged in. 

“Antenida 756-28.’’ 

“I have a call for Captain Juan 
La Gola.” 

“Just a minute, please.” 

The captain did not answer; and 
then I caught sight of him, striding 
across the lobby. He took the call at 
one of the house phones, and after 
he had talked for a moment he 
seemed to become greatly excited. 
When he hung up he stood there for 
several minutes, drumming his fin- 
gers on the counter. 

Then he came up to me. He be- 
came confidential in a way I knew 
he woqjdn’t dream of had he not 
been so disturbed. 

“Jennie,” he said, “how long have 
you lived in San Carlo?” 

“A little more than two months,” 
I replied. 

“You came from the United 
States, yes'?” 

“From Iowa.” 

“And how do you like San Carlo? 
Specifically, how do you like El 
Presidente Solera?” 

“Like him?” I said uncertainly. 



“I’m not sure I know what you 
mean.” 

“He’s a dictator, Jennie. Do you 
like dictators?” 

“Look,” I said with some annoy- 
ance, “I just run the switchboard. 
Local politics are a little out of my 
field.” 

He nodded and lit a cigarette, ex- 
pelling the smoke through his nos- 
trils. “You wouldn’t tolerate dic- 
tators in your country,” he said. 
“Why should we here?” 

I said nothing. He went on, 

“When the machinery of a gov- 
ernment becomes decrepit, it is time 
for a change. That change can bring 
wonderful results when it comes 
from far out and its operators are 
far more, advanced than we, even if 
they are alien.” 

“What do you mean, alien?” I 
said. 

He shrugged and smiled crypi- 
cally. 

“I’m expecting a . friend ... a 
Mr. Smith. Will you tell the room 
clerk to see that he gets the finest 
accommodations possible?” 

Next day the captain dictated two 
letters, and he signed them with the 
number 87. 

If possible the man became more 
disagreeable. He strutted about the 
lobby, his boots polished, his tunic 
buttoned to the throat. He gave or- 
ders and he signed the endless flow 
of napers that were brought to him. 

I couldn’t help thinking about that 
three-panel dreamer in La Gola’s 
room. Was it possible, I wondered, 
for such a machine to superinduce 
dreams of the future. And were 
those dreams merely prophetic or — 



120 



IF 




and I know this sounds foolish, 
Elsie — or did they cause those events 
visualized on the disc actually to 
happen? 

These questions gnawed away at 
me, and finally I decided to have an- 
other look at the captain’s room; but 
the door had been fitted with a new 
lock, and I couldn’t open it. It was 
perhaps just as well for I had a feel- 
ing I was being watched. And next 
day when I was retrieving a pencil 
I had occasion to view the back un- 
derside of the switchboard. There 
was a small box, the size of a cigar 
box, mounted there. Opening the lid, 
I saw a small compact tape recorder. 

It soon became apparent that Pres- 
ident Solera and his party were not 
here for a hunting vacation. Oh, sev- 
eral of his aides went out with guns 
and came back with tropicora quail, 
but they were lesser-fry sycophants 
whose movements meant little. Ev- 
ery few hours some official arrived 
at the hotel and demanded to see 
El Presidente. First came the civil- 
ian VIPs, next the 'military men, 
bristling with gold braid and self im- 
portance; and finally more civilians 
— scientists, judging from their talk 
and far-away looks. Everything was 
hush-hush; little groups stood about 
the lobby, talking in low tones. The 
switchboard was alive with calls, but 
almost every conversation was made 
meaningless with a scrambler. 

They even took over the hotel’s 
patio. Four big telescopes were 
mounted on tripods there, and in one 
afternoon all the beautiful bougan- 
villea were trampled on. I went into 
town on my day off and found the 
same confusion in Rodosa. No one 



would answer questions. Ask, and 
you received the same answer: 
“Quien sabe, Senorita?” 

There were rumors, of course, and 
these multiplied as peasants began to 
filter in, uncertain and bewildered. 
One family told of seeing “a great 
white shadow” skimming over the 
trees, hovering over the ground in 
the vicinity of Balerano, twenty 
miles north. An old man reported 
seeing a huge cigar-shaped thing 
high up from which smaller wing- 
less objects emerged to descend with 
great rapidity. 

About this time Mr. Smith, Cap- 
tain La Gola’s friend, arrived. He 
came in the hotel alone without lug- 
gage, and there was something odd 
about the way he walked across the 
lobby to the desk. He moved with a 
kind of jerkiness as if his leg muscles 
were stiff and not used to action. His 
clothes were ill-fitting, and I got the 
impression he disliked wearing them, 
although they were ordinary civilian 
clothes. His voice grating and par- 
rot-like. 

“My name is Smith,” he said to 
the room clerk. “I believe a reser- 
vation has been made for me.” 

In compliance with Captain La 
Gola’s wishes, he was assigned to 
the executive suite on the fifth floor. 

Well, I’m not exactly a fool and 
I can put two and two together and 
make four. During the night trick I 
sat there before the silent switch- 
board with the big lobby deserted 
and quiet as a tomb, and the more 
I thought about all the things that 
had happened since I had come to 
San Carlo and Rodosa, the more I 
seemed to see a pattern take form 



HE LOOKED BACK 



121 




with Captain La Gola at one end 
and, curiously, Mr. Smith at the 
other. 

I thought of the wreck of the 
Sonera Express and the destruction 
of <he interception missile and the 
closing-off of the observatory at 
San Medro, all the preparations — 
troops and guns, and scopes in the 
patio — and the tape recorder on the 
switchboard, and I ithought of Pres- 
ident Solera and the wild stories told 
by the peasants who had come down 
from me north. 

At one a. m. I was having my 
lonely coffee break when the whine 
of the descending lift broke the 
sileaoe. The lift door opened and 
President Solera stepped out. I 
didn’t know him at first. He wore 
dask glasses, and the collar of his 
coat was turned up hiding the lower 
part of his face. 

He came straight up to the switch- 
board. “Is there a through bus to 
Porto Vargas tonight?” 

I did a double take. El Presidente 
on a bus? 

“There’s one in half an hour,” I 
said, “but it doesn’t stop here at the 
hotel. You have to pick it up in 
Rodosa.” 

He stood there in hesitation. 
Then: “If anyone asks, you haven’t 
seen me, understand.” Before I 
could refuse, he had thrust a bill 
across the counter and was striding 
across- the lobby to the door. 

He had but gone out, when the 
second lift came down and Captain 
La Gola emerged. He lit a cigarette, 
strolled to the door and went out on- 
to the veranda. In the mirror above 
the switchboard, my only unob- 



structed line of vision, I watched 
him move idly toward the steps, 
stop and lean against a post. 

Beyond the veranda I could see 
the gaunt figure of President Solera 
as he strode across the brilliantly-lit 
plaissance. 

For a full minute Captain La 
Gola continued to stand there, 
smoking. Then he moved sideways 
out of range of my mirror. An in- 
stant later a scream rose to my lips. 
A thin tracer of lavender had dart- 
ed across the open space, straight 
toward President Solera. In mid- 
stride the man halted while a shud- 
der ran through his frame. His head 
jerked back; his shoulders twisted; 
then he pitched forward like a string- 
cut puppet and lay still. 

Well, you know well enough how 
the assassination threw all San Carlo 
in a state of shock. I suppose there 
is no need to describe to you the 
reactions here at the hotel. The 
hours that followed were hours I’d 
like to forget, a frenetic mixture of 
confusion, gloom and chaos. There 
were some the murder cast into the 
depths of despair. There were others 
who were openly elated at the re- 
moval of what they called an iron- 
bound dictatorship. 

As for me, I was in a nerve- 
wracked dilemma, so shaken I could 
hardly operate the switchboard. For 
while I hadn’t seen the source of 
that fatal shot, I was sure it had 
come from Captain La Gola. Yet 
what value would be placed on the 
testimony of a telephone girl whose 
only means of observation had been 
by way of a six-inch mirror. Still I 
had to tell someone.

IF 




I told Mr. Alverez. He said, “The 
Investigators Federale will be here 
tomorrow. I advise you to wait and 
speak to them.” 

Meanwhile neither Captain La 
Gola nor his friends were to be seen. 
Until evening. Then Mr. Smith came 
to the desk and informed the room 
clerk he was checking out. But be- 
fore he left he dictated a letter: 

We thank you for your ap- 
plication for our investigation 
of your primary (Mokart 
Scale: 246) culture in your sec- 
ondary (Class: C-X-l) world. 
While we found many things 
which would indicate sociolog- 
ical and technological advance- 
ment, certain representative pri- 
mordial characteristics make in- 
clusion into the Galactic Fed- 
eration inadvisable at this time: 
specifically the resort to mili- 
tary ordnance when govern- 
mental conversion was sus- 
pected to be imminent; and the 
ruthless homicide of an oligarch 
simply for the minority dislike 
of his political policies and the 
acquisition of his political 
status. We regret this decision 
but advise you herewith it is 
final. 

That was the letter, Elsie, and 
when I had typed it, Mr. Smith af- 
fixed his signature and said he would 
like the letter delivered to Captain 
La Gola personally. So because it 
seemed important I took it up my- 
self. The Captain’s face when he 
opened the door was drawn, and fear 
seemed to have frozen his features. 



His clothing was rumpled, and his 
hair in disarray as if he had just 
awakened from a heavy sleep. He 
told me to come in in case there 
might be a reply. 

As Captain La Gola finished read- 
ing the letter his face blanched. He 
lowered the paper slowly, .then 
brought it up and read it again. “He 
can’t do that!” he cried. “He can’t 
. .” He turned and ran out the 
door toward the waiting lift. 

And then my gaze was drawn 
farther in the room to the table on 
which the dreamer stood. There was 
a motionless scene on the dreamer’s 
disc, the final scene apparently from 
Captain La Gola’s recent sleep. 

It was a scene like a three-dimen- 
sional photograph. In the foreground 
was the captain, running toward an 
indefinite figure that could be only 
Mr. Smith some hundred yards 
ahead. At that frozen moment of the 
visual dream Mr. Smith was in the 
act of entering a dark cigar-shaped 
shadow from whose upper midsec- 
tion a violet flame was just begin- 
ning to blossom outward. There was 
terror in La Gola’s face even as he 
realized he could not make Mr. 
Smith aware of his approach. Terror 
as he realized that in another split 
second he would be engulfed by 
those flames. 

Well, I guess that’s all, Elsie. I 
never saw either of them again. I 
did see a petrified block in a 
scorched glade a mile north of Ro- 
dosa, just off the Highway Nation- 
ale. The peasants of the district 
pointed out its vaguely human shape 
and compared it to a scriptural char- 
acter — Lot’s wife. END

The Junk Man Cometh 

by ROBIN SCOTT 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



Interesting junk'. Nobody knew 
what it was meant for — but a 
lot of people wanted to get it! 



I 

O ne day late in June of ’86, I was 
sitting on the veranda of the 
family home in Ard County, West 
Virginia, trying to match the rapidly 
diminishing figures in my checkbook 
against the printing bills beginning 
to come in for the campaign posters 
I’d ordered. 

It was getting pretty obvious that 
there just wasn’t going to be enough 



money for even a half-way adequate 
senatorial campaign. I’d been out 
stumping around the state in earnest 
for the previous two weeks and I 
was tired. My conscience was 
troubling me too; I’d been neglecting 
my share of the work in the family 
junk business. 

All this was on my mind when we 
got a call from a junk dealer over 
near Morgantown asking us to bid 
in on a load of Army surplus MHD 



124 





generators he’d just picked up and 
claimed he couldn’t handle. His ask- 
ing price sounded pretty good; I 
was tired of worrying about my own 
problems, and I told Pop I’d run over 
to have a look. 

“Old Jacobs is a shady character,” 
warned Pop. “Don’t let him sell you 
no pig in no poke.” 

I agreed to be cautious, pocketed 
the company checkbook and drove 
the thirty miles to Morgantown in 
the pickup. The front rotor was act- 
ing up, and it took me the best part 
of half an hour on those country 
roads to make the trip. 

But it was worth it, or at least I 
thought so at first. Jacobs had the 
goods. Two hundred cannisters with 
the factory seals on them, each 
painted olive-drab and stenciled with 
the model number and other nomen- 
clature appropriate to the generators. 
I checked them against the catalogue 
listings, and at Jacobs’ price I figur- 
ed we could make a pretty neat pro- 
fit on them. I wrote out a check for 
sixty of them and headed for home. 

The next morning, my brother 
Buzzy decided that he needed a hair- 
cut and would take the carryall and 
two yard hands to pick up the can- 
nisters at JacQbs’ yard on the way 
back. Along about noon, Buzzy’s 
wife Phyllis stuck her head out of 
the kitchen door to holler at me in 
my alfresco office on the veranda. 
Phyllis had reproduced herself twice 
and Buzzy three times, and what 
with the kids constantly getting lost 
in the junk yard, she has developed 
a pretty fine voice for such a little 
woman. 



“PERCE,” she bellowed from not 
more than ten feet away. “WHEN 
YOU LOOK FOR BUZZY TO GET 
BACK?” 

“I don’t know, Phyllis,” I said. 
“But I expect he heard you inquire 
after him wherever he is.” 

She lowered her voice a couple 
of hundred watts. “He left here be- 
fore eight and he should have been 
back by now. I’ve got to take these 
kids into Morgantown for their shots 
at one o’clock.” 

1 looked at my watch and heaved 
myself to my feet. “Maybe one of 
the rotors on the carryall gave out 
on him. I’ll take the pickup and see 
if I can find him.” 

I backed the pickup out of its 
shed, skirted a pile of tangled and 
rusty reinforcing rod and pulled out 
toward the road. Pop was coming 
back from the mailbox, and he hop- 
ped aboard to come along for the 
ride. 

About three miles beyond Carson’s 
Corners we found the carryall and 
Buzzy. He was still alive, and Pop 
got on the pickup telephone to the 
Morgantown State Highway Patrol 
— even while I was stripping off 
Buzzy’s shirt to see what I could do 
for him. The Patrol ductor arrived 
in minutes, and Pop rode off with 
Buzzy to the hospital. I stuck around 
with the Highway Patrol and tried 
to make some sense of the scene. 

The evidence was confusing. Both 
men with Buzzy were dead. Old Ed 
Vickers was cut clean in two and 
the two halves of his body .were a 
hundred yards apart. Billy White — 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



125 




at least we assumed it was Billy — 
was burned beyond recognition. The 
carryall itself lay on its side, black- 
ened and crumpled. Under it lay 
the flattened remains of what had 
once been a white Jaguar XS con- 
vertible. Although from the time and 
the heading of the carryall it looked 
like Buzzy had been on his way back 
to the yard, he must not have made 
it to Jacobs’ to pick up the genera- 
tors; the carryall — or what was left 
of it — was empty, and there was 
no sign of cargo spilled out along 
the road. 

The Patrol sergeant set his men 
to taking measurements and looking 
for skid marks. He shot a few photos 
and then stood scratching his head. 

“It don’t make no sense, Congers- 
man Sansoni. It looks kinda like 
maybe your brother plowed into that 
there Jag-u-ar, I wouldn’t thought 
it’d flip a big ol’ carryall like that.” 
He stooped to peer under the wreck- 
ed carryall. “And what happened 
to the party drivin’ the Jag?” 

I shook my head and shrugged. 
It didn’t make any more sense to 
me. “I agree, Sergeant. And where 
did the fire come from? Both ve- 
hicles are Cesium-powered. And 
what happened to poor old Vickers? 
What could have cut him up like 
that?” 

It was the Sergeant’s turn to shrug. 
“Damn’f I know. Guess we’ll just 
have" to wait and see what your 
brothers’s got to say.” I looked away 
from the Sergeant and swallowed a 
pretty good-sized lump in my throat. 
Right then it didn’t look as though 
Buzzy would ever be able to say 
much of anything again. 



O ne of the principles which had 
guided my father, Albert San- 
soni, to a highly successful career 
as a junk dealer was to Keep the 
Stock Up. Pop would buy anything 
if the price were right and the quan- 
tity meaningful, always confident 
that somebody, somewhere would 
someday pay him a higher price for 
it. Well, West Virginia real estate 
was cheap, and there was no short- 
age of boon-docks to Jhold Pop’s 
acquistions. And of course he was 
right. There was always someone, 
somewhere. 

Still, we used to kid the old man 
a lot. I remember Buzzy once saying 
that if Pop had a chance to buy up 
all of the old 1972 calendars in ’73 
for a song, he’d do it just in hopes 
that ’72 would come back again 
someday and he could make a kill- 
ing. Somehow, with Pop’s luck, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if he couldn’t 
come out on a deal like that, some- 
how, with somebody, someday. 

Pop applied his principle of Keep 
the Stock Up in raising Buzzy and 
me. Buzzy, who pretty well shares 
the old man’s genius for mechanics, 
for combining useless junk into 
something highly saleable, picked up 
degrees in metallurgy, mechanical 
engineering and physics. He fought 
against it those years in school, but 
Pop is pretty persuasive, and he kept 
Buzzy at it. 

“You never know when you might 
need to know some of that stuff, 
Buzzy,” he would say. “I never had 
no opportunity like you got, and 
you damn-well better make the best 
of it.” Buzzy would sometimes argue 
back and plead and protest. But Pop 



126 



IF 




finally put an end to the worst of 
these arguments with a blasted: “All 
right! You go ahead and marry 
Phyllis! But after your honeymoon, 
you get yourself back up to the col- 
lege #r I'll stomp the tar out’n you!” 

Phyllis was the girl Buzzy had 
dated since he came back from the 
Sino-Sov war. “The college” at that 
time was M.I.T. 

As for me, I’m two years older 
than Buzzy and a good deal more 
independent. While I didn’t inherit 
much of the family’s mechanical ap- 
titude. I got a full measure of the 
old man’s stubbornness. Along about 
high school, I got hooked on politics, 
played football and earned myself a 
law degree at the University of Vir- 
ginia. I then spent two years at Ox- 
ford under the posthumous patron- 
age of Cecil Rhodes and — after the 
war — came back to West Virginia 
to become the youngest congressman 
the 14th District had ever sent to 
Washington. 

All this stretched Pop’s utilitarian 
philosophy a good deal, but I guess he 
is not the only man who considers 
politicians a pretty useless form of 
life. Still, he made the best of it, 
gave me what financial support he 
could for my campaigns and was 
— I think — secretly a little proud 
of me. 

I like politics, and I was a pretty 
good congressman. After three terms 
in the House, I was making serious 
plans to enter the senatorial race in 
*84, when I faced one of those situ- 
ations which confronts every poli- 
tician at one time or another. And 
maybe because of Pop or because 
of Cecil Rhodes or just because I 



am built that way, I acted according 
to my conscience — which can be a 
very expensive luxury in politics. 

I won’t go into the details, but 
after the dust had settled, I found 
myself still reasonably popular with 
the West Virginia electorate, but 
banished from public life by the West 
Virginia Party machine. My hopes 
for the senatorial nomination went 
glimm ering, and my place on the 
congressional ballot went to an old 
Party hack from Green County. As 
a result, at thirty-four, former Con- 
gressman Percival Sansoni could be 
found almost any fine morning in 
the spring of 1986 sitting on the 
veranda of the family home, study- 
ing the most recent issue of the 
Metals Reclamation Monthly . 

That’s how it was that I found 
myself — for a while at least — 
back in the family business. 

II 

F rom the way he had looked when 
we had loaded him into the 
State Highway Patrol ductor for 
transport to the hospital, I thought 
for sure old Buzzy had had it. But 
Buzzy turned out lucky. He had 
some pretty bad burns, mostly on 
his back, but when I finally got in 
to see him the next day along with 
the Patrol investigator, he was more 
angry than injured. 

“Boy, wait’ll I get my hands on 
those bums!” Buzzy was lying on 
his stomach, his chest supported by 
a couple of pillows. 

“Who do you mean, Mr. San- 
soni?” asked the investigator. He had 
his recorder running. 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



127 




“The hijackers! The guys that 
bushwhacked us!” 

“Hijackers?” I echoed stupidly. 

The investigator leaned forward 
from his chair to bring the micro- 
phone closer to Buzzy. 

“Why don’t you start at the be- 
ginning, Mr. Sansoni, and tell us 
what happened.” 

As Buzzy told it, greatly inter- 
spersed with profanity and clouds of 
cigar smoke, he’d gone into Morgan- 
town that morning and gotten his 
haircut as planned. Then he had 
driven to Jacobs’ yard, and he and 
Billy and Ed had loaded the MHD 
generators on the carryall. They 
headed for home then and were 
just topping the grade out of Carson’s 
Comers, when Buzzy spotted the 
Jaguar parked across the road, 
pretty well blocking it. 

The investigator interrupted at this 
point. “What was your speed when 
you first spotted the Jag, Mr. San- 
soni?” 

“Ah hell, I couldn’t have been do- 
ing more than one-ten, one-fifteen. 
We were pretty well loaded, and 
we’d just come up that grade.” 

As soon as Buzzy had seen the 
Jaguar, he’d reversed thrust, dropped 
the carryall down on the ground- 
effect shrouding and come to a stop 
about fifty yards on down the road 
from where the Jaguar had been. 

“We rolled over that Jag like it 
wasn’t -even there, but I heard the 
forward rotors tear into it and drag 
it along, and I knew I’d burned up 
the shrouds skidding along like that. 
I was mad enough to spit nails.” 

“Was there anyone in the Jag?” 
asked the investigator. 



“Hell no! And at first I figured 
some damn fool had just left it sit- 
ting there. Busted a rotor or run out 
of catalyst or something. Then I 
found out different.” 

Buzzy had dropped out of the cab, 
cursing, and started to work his way 
in through the ruined shrouding to 
take a look at the forward rotor, 
when there had been a flash and he 
heard a man scream — either Billy 
or Ed — he didn’t know which. The 
next thing he knew the carryall was 
flipped over on its side, and there 
was fire everywhere. The last thing 
he remembered was a big piece of 
tattered shrouding, stinking of 
smouldering rubber and fiber, drop- 
ping down on top of him. It prob- 
ably saved his life. 

Buzzy was worn out with so much 
talk, and the doctor shooed us out 
of his room. In the hall, the investi- 
gator rewound his tape and shook 
his head, clucking to himself. 

“We haven’t had a case of hijack- 
ing in this county for twenty years. 
Your brother must have had a pretty 
valuable and tempting cargo.” 

I stopped short, and for the first 
time I began to realize just how 
little sense the whole thing made. 
“What’s a Jaguar like that worth?” 
I asked. 

“They run about ten thousand 
new, and that one was new.” 

“Then it doesn’t make any sense,” 
I said. “Whoever hijacked that car- 
go destroyed ten thousand dollars 
worth of ductor to do it and got 
sixty generators at a junk price of 
two hundred bucks apiece. They 
made two thousand dollars and kill- 
ed two people doing it.”

The investigator looked hard at 
me. “Maybe three. The Jaguar was 
registered to a woman in New York. 
She hasn’t been heard of since she 
left Morgantown yesterday morn- 
ing.” 

Ill 

A lthough I grew up in one of the 
biggest junk yards in the East, 
it never occurred to me until pretty 
recently to really think about junk. I 
read the other day where some ar- 
cheologist was calling for Federal 
funds to make a national memorial 
out of a big junk yard up in Rhode 
Island. Claimed it was a treasure 
trove for future generations of ar- 
cheologists, a “many-layered record 
of the achievements of our society.” 
Conspicuous consumption and so 
forth. 

Maybe so. But — until recently 
— I never entertained such elevated 
ideas about junk; and if the elec- 
tions go the way I hope they will 
this fall, I don’t expect to give the 
subject much consideration in the 
future. 

My father, being both a very suc- 
cessful junk dealer for over thirty- 
five years and something of an 
original thinker by patural bent, has 
a well-developed philosophy of junk. 
I can picture Pop — a skinny, tough 
little man with bandy legs, a face 
like a geologist’s map and two bright 
eyes behind thick spectacles — Pop 
expounding this philosophy in his 
rough West Virginia speech to Mom 
(before she died) or to one of the 
neighbors or to anyone who would 
drink a beer with him and listen. 



“The thing you gotta realize about 
junk,” he would begin, “is that 
ever’thin’ in the world is junk to 
someone, while at the same time, 
they ain’t nothin' in the world that 
ain’t worth somethin' to someone 
somewheres. It all depends on your 
pointa view.’ 1 

This statement would usually earn 
Pop a quizzical look from his list- 
ener, and practised as he was in ex- 
position, he’d take a long pull on 
his beer to let the full dramatic ef- 
fect sink in before continuing with 
his theory. 

“Now to show you what I mean, 
you take your A - rab oil million- 
aire with his fifty Cadillacs and two 
hunert wives and jools and all, set- 
tin’ in his hot ol’ tent just wishin’ 
them slaves’d work them fans a lit- 
tle faster, and you send him a nice 
shiney fuel-oil stove right out’n the 
factory.” 

Pop would pause again and fix 
his listener with a piercing eye. “Why 
its junk, ain’t it! Far’s that /1-rab’s 
concerned, it about as useless as 
teats on a boar hog!” 

Then Pop would lower his voice 
to a conspiratorial tone: ”Oh t’other 
hand, you go on out in the yard 
there and dig up a couple them sorry 
old magnetic heat-exchangers and 
some of them cruddy surplus blow- 
ers, and you hook ’em together and 
give ’em a coat of paint and send ’em 
off to that old /4-rab, and he’s gon- 
na be some kinda happy! I know, 
’cause I done it already.” 

After this, Pop would sit back as 
if exhausted from the force of his 
argument and suck down whatever 
was left of his beer. Then, if he was 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



129 




talking to me or to my brother 
Buzzy, he’d add some shrewd obser- 
vation on the business of being a 
junk dealer as part of his continuing 
program which was intended to pre- 
pare us to take over the business 
from him someday. 

As he talked he would sweep his 
arm comprehensively around the 
fifteen acres of crowded yard, tak- 
ing in the old ground-effect cars, the 
rusting industrial machinery, the 
hulks of surplus military equipment, 
the rows of factory-reject appliances, 
the piles of bent ductor fans, the 
rolls of wire and heaps of industrial 
scrap, the stacks of crated electronic 
gear, the million and one bits and 
pieces which lay oxidizing quietly — 
each element in its own sure way — 
in the hot West Virginia sun. 

IV 

T hat night, after the Patrol in- 
vestigator’s interview with 
Buzzy, Phyllis cooked supper for 
the kids and Pop and me and then 
went off to spend the evening with 
Buzzy. Pop and I sat in the warm 
summer darkness out on the veranda, 
drinking beer and watching each 
other flip cigarette butts over the 
rail. There was a big, fat, lazy moon 
rising off the end of the airstrip, its 
yellow light silhouetting the steel 
spires and crags of the yard. The 
old M-70 tank Pop had stripped to 
bulldoze with looked like a war 
memorial. In fact the whole yard 
looked like a battle field in the 
moonlight, tom by shot and shell. 
During the day, with the bright wink 
of cutting torches, the raucous whine 



of the yard machinery, the squeals 
of Buzzy’s kids as they clambered 
like mountain goats on the piles of 
scrap, the yard was a cheerful place. 
I’d grown up in that junk, and I 
knew what a wonderful fairyland it 
was for kids. 

But at night, silent and deserted, 
the yard looked like a place where 
giants had wrestled, where great 
issues had been decided at high cost, 
leaving the wasted detritus conflict 
always brings. 

Pop heaved his empty beer can 
out into the darkness. For a man of 
sixty, Pop can still heave pretty far. 
It took a long time for the distant 
clatter to come back to us. He peeled 
the top off another and propped his 
feet on the veranda rail. “Perce?” 
he said. 

“Yeah, Pop.” 

“I run this yard more’n thirty- 
five years now. Ain’t never been 
nobody hurt workin’ for me here — 
until yesterday anyways.” 

“Yeah, I know Pop. But it wasn’t 
your fault.” 

Pop sighed and was silent for a 
moment. Then he snapped his chair 
back on the floor from its tilted posi- 
tion and stamped angrily to his feet. 

“Listen, son. Ever’thin’ about this 
yard is my fault! Somebody gits hurt 
workin’ for me, I’m damn-well gon- 
na find out why! I’m gonna git them 
bums that done it to Buzzy and Ed 
and Billy!” 

“Now take it easy, Pop. That’s 
what the police are for — ” 

“Police, hell! They ain’t never 
gonna figure it out. They ain’t even 
figured out how them hijackers man- 
aged to tip over a forty-five ton 



130 



IF 




carryall and burn it up thataway, 
much less who done it!” 

“Or for that matter,” I added, 
musing, “why?” 

“What do you mean, ‘why’,” Pop’s 
voice grew quieter. “They was hi- 
jackin’, wasn’t they? Stealin’ Buzzy’s 
cargo!” 

I shook my head in the darkness. 
“It doesn’t add up, Pop. Why would 
anybody go to all that trouble, 
smash up a ten thousand dollar car, 
wreck a carryall and kill two men, 
just to get sixty surplus MHD gen- 
erators worth maybe two-fifty apiece, 
tops?” 

T hat stopped the old man for a 
minute. Another empty clatter- 
ed in the darkness, and the flare of 
a match illuminated the old man’s 
face, his heavy white brows drawn 
together in thought, his lined and 
seamed face etched with concern. 
Pop looks like an old white-haired 
Indian when he’s worried about 
something. Other times he looks like 
a skinny Santa Claus. 

“Perce, like I always say, the 
value of junk depends on how much 
somebody wants it. Them generators 
ain’t worth more’n two fifty to you 
and me, but somebody else must’ve 
wanted' ’em pretty bad.” 

“Granted, Pop,” I said. “But the 
surplus catalogues are full of brand 
new generators. The government 
over-procured on them when it look- 
ed like that South Africa business 
was going to get nasty, and now 
they’re all over the place. Maybe 
the guys who bushwhacked Buzzy 
would’ve had to pay three or four 
hundred for them — I got a pretty 



good bargain out of Jacobs — but 
they sure as hell didn’t have enough 
to justify stealing them and killing 
people.” 

That stopped Pop again, but only 
for a minute. “What’d you say you 
paid old man Jacobs for them genera- 
tors?” There was a note of excite- 
ment in his voice. 

“Two hundred.” 

“And they was new? Factory seal- 
ed?” 

“The one I inspected was.” 

“One. You only looked at one?” 
Pop’s voice held a familiar note of 
accusation. 

“Heck, Pop. The others were all 
in sealed cannisters. What would 
have been the point of — ” 

“Perce, I done told you to watch 
that Jacobs. He’s a sharp one. He 
wouldn’t let you have them genera- 
tors for no two hundred bucks if 
there wasn’t somethin’ wrong some- 
wheres.” He snapped his fingers. 
“Sure, that’s it. You bought yourself 
one surplus MHD generator and 
fifty -nine somethin * elses!” 

I was chagrined. I knew what Pop 
said made sense, and maybe I had 
been taken. Somewhat sheepishly I 
said: “I suppose you’re right, Pop. 
I guess I’m lucky I didn’t take all 
two hundred of them.” 

Pop exploded. “You mean he had 
more of them at that price. Why in 
the name of heaven didn’t you clean 
him out?” 

“But Pop! If he was cheating me, 
it’s a good thing I didn’t!” 

Pop was half-way down the veran- 
da stairs, when he turned back to 
inquire, “How many times I gotta 
tell you, Perce, Keep the Stock Up!”

backed the pickup out into the yard. 
He jumped down then and disappear- 
ed into the house, reappearing mo- 
ments later with his arms full of 
weapons he’d salvaged at one time or 
another from junked military equip- 
ment and put into working order just 
for the hell of it. Pop didn’t even own 
a hunting license, but he had enough 
death and destruction in his arms to 
outfit a banana-republic constabu- 
lary. 

There was a BAR of world war 
II vintage, old but oiled and gleam- 
ing. There was a 55 mm bazooka 
of somewhat later date, a fairly new 
lazgun, one of the high-frenquency 
types like I’d used in Australia ten 
years before, and a 75-shot officers- 
issue carbine which was still stan- 
dard in the Army. He dumped his 
load with a clatter in the bed of the 




THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



pickup and dove back into the house 
to reappear in a moment with a 
qrate of bazooka shells, a couple of 
hundred rounds for the BAR and 
two spare power packs for the laz- 
gun. He dumped his load in on top 
of the weapons and climbed up into 
the seat next to me in the cab. He 
wasn’t even breathing hard. 

I went to full thrust, and negoti- 
ated the lane leading to the Morgan- 
town road at top speed before I said 
anything. When we’d settled down to 
a nice even one-fifty, I shouted to 
Pop above the whine of the rotors: 
“Hey Pop! What’s all the armament 
for? You got enough there for an 
army!” 

Pop struck a match on the pickup 
door and swallowed a cloud of cig- 
arette smoke. “Perce, you seen what 
a mess that carryall was and what 
they done to Ed and Billy — ” 

He didn’t have to say anything 
more. I knew what the weapons 
were for, and I was glad Pop had 
thought to bring them. 

We sat in silence during the twen- 
ty-minute drive to Morgantown. The 
town was deserted; it was nearly 
midnight. Once through and on the 
other side, we whipped down the 
grade to Carson’s Corners, where 
Buzzy had been waylaid the day be- 
fore, and took the turn into Jacobs’ 
access road with rotors whining and 
the outboard shrouding scraping 
clouds of dust from the dirt road. 

The Jacobs yard was dark, but 
there was plenty of moonlight, 
enough to reveal the empty loading 
platform. 

“They’re gone, Pop. He must have 
sold them to someone else.” 



133 




“Yeah.” There was disappoint- 
ment in Pop’s voice. “But let’s us 
talk to the old bum. Maybe we can 
shake outa him what was in them 
cannisters.” 

I parked the pickup, and we 
walked up to the dark shed that was 
old Jacobs’ combined bachelor quar- 
ters and office. Pop banged on the 
door, but there was no flare of light 
or answering stream of profanity. I 
left Pop on the front porch and 
walked around to the rear. Jacobs’ 
yard wasn’t anywhere near as big 
as ours; according to Pop, he spe- 
cialized in junked ductors, making a 
good living out of reclaiming cesium 
oxide and now and again taking on 
a hot vehicle for illicit resale. Still, 
the same moon that shone on our 
yard shone on Jacobs’, and there 
was the same sense of desolation 
and look of ended conflict in Jacobs’ 
shadowed junk piles. 

T he illusion of a battlefield was 
heightened by Jacobs himself 
— as I found him that night behind 
his home. Or at least pieces of him. 
I don’t know if they ever found all 
of him. There was enough, though, 
once I sorted it out from the black- 
ened ruins of his pickup truck. There 
was a head and most of an arm still 
in the smashed cab. The rest was 
pretty widely distributed 

I threw up and then shouted for 
Pop. He’s a tough old bird, Pop, 
but he got sick too when he saw 
what I was looking at. The empty 
platform and the carnage behind the 
house didn’t leave much doubt as 
to what had happened. I still didn’t 
buy the hijacker theory, but I walked 



around the pickup and pulled the 
lazgun out of the clutter in the bed 
and strapped it on anyway. 

I rejoined Pop, who was rather 
futilely trying to cover up what was 
left of Jacobs with a piece of tar- 
paulin. He’d have needed several 
hundred square feet to have done the 
job properly. 

“I guess we better give the High- 
way Patrol a call,” I said. 

“Yeah,” said Pop. “But lets us 
look around a little • bit first. Old 
Jacobs wasn’t the sort to put all his 
eggs in one basket. There may be 
some more of them cannisters stuck 
around here somewheres.” 

Pop got a flashlight out of the 
pickup, and we went hunting. After 
a quarter of an hour we found them, 
twenty of them, standing stacked 
two-high in the little shed Jacobs 
had used as his workshop. 

“These like the ones you bought?” 
Pop gestured with his flashlight. 

“Yes. Identical as far as I can 
see.” 

Pop bent to examine the cannis- 
ters more closely. “They ain’t Army 
cannisters, Perce. I ain’t never seen 
none like this before. Looky here. 
Look at this sealing band.” 

I looked and then realized I’d 
never seen a seal like that before 
either, except maybe for the sixty 
I’d bought the other day, when I 
hadn’t really examined them closely. 

“But Pop, it’s stenciled right on 
them: ‘ONE EA MHD GEN MOD 
2 MARK IV U.S. ARMY DEL- 
PHOS DEPOT’.” 

Pop directed the flashlight at the 
wall above Jacobs’ workbench. There 
hung a stencil with yellow paint:

TOPED SOHPLED 

“Old crook — rest his soul — sold 
you ringers, all right.” 

I went for the pickup and backed 
it up to the door of the workshop. 
We shifted our arsenal into the cab 
and loaded all twenty cannisters onto 
the truck bed. It was hot work; each 
cannister weighed the best part of 
three hundred pounds, and when we 
were finished the rear shrouding was 
belled out against the ground. 

We got ready to leave, and the 
thought hit me. “Hey Pop, wait a 
minute! Last couple of times some- 
body tried to truck these cannisters 
around, they got chopped into little 
pieces. Maybe we better think a bit.” 
Pop didn’t hesitate. “You might 
be right, son. But we can’t do noth- 
in’ with these babies here, and may- 
be the guys that got old Jacobs will 
figure the same as we did and come 
back to see if there’s any more.” 

I looked around the dark yard and 
shivered. Pop had a point. He fired 
the turbine and opened the door for 
me to climb into the cab beside him. 

“No, Pop. You drive, and I’ll ride 
shotgun jn the back.” Pop shrugged 
in that comical way he has when 
he’s really under pressure. 

“Okay. Choose your weapon, son.” 
I pulled the BAR out of the pile 
and took the belt of ammo he hand- 
ed me. “Keep your eyes peeled, 
son.” 

I climbed in back and settled my- 
self among the cannisters. “You too, 
Pop.” 



I wanted to look brave and non- 
chalant, and I poked a cigarette in 
my mouth with the kind of tougih- 
guy gesture I’d seen on 3-D. But my 
lighter was out of gas, and I had to 
be content to perch on the cannisters 
looking every bit as frightened as I 
felt. 

T he* rotors roared, and the heav- 
ily laden truck moved off on to 
the highway. We went through Car- 
son’s Corners wide open and whined 
up the grade outside of town at top 
speed. Once we passed the point 
where Buzzy had been bushwhacked, 
I began — foolishly — to breath easier. 
Then we were in Morgantown, and 
Pop had to drop down to sixty-five 
to make some of the turns in town. 
Once again in open country, he 
really opened her up. I was begin- 
ning to think we were home free, 
when something large and dark ap- 
peared a few hundred feet above the 
moonlit road behind us, blotting out 
a segment of stars. 

I started to shout a warning into 
the wind, but by that time Pop had 
spotted the tank-truck blocking the 
road ahead, and he reversed thrust 
and slewed off onto the berm. The 
heavy truck sat down hard on its 
shrouding, skidded crazily, and 
clipped a couple of small pines, but 
Pop managed to wrestle it off the 
road and bring it to a stop to one 
side of the stalled oil truck. I caught 
a glimpse of the driver’s body, man- 
gled and torn, lying half out of the 
open cab door. 

N ow clearly visible, the black 
shape — something like a flat- 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



135 




tened teardrop — slowed. A bright 
spot glowed high on its prow, and 
the tops of the pines along the road 
burst into flame. The beam from 
the strange craft swept across the oil 
truck. There was a massive blast and 
a wave of heat, and thick black bil- 
lows of smoke began to pour across 
the road into the thicket which con- 
cealed us. 

I shouted at the top of my lungs: 
“Take off, Pop! The smoke’ll screen 
us.” Hoping Pop would think I was 
still aboard, I rolled silently off the 
truck bed, the BAR cradled in my 
arms, and flopped to the ground. I 
opened up with the BAR. It was no 
match for whatever it was that had 
burned up the tank truck and the 
trees around us, but I figured it 
might give Pop enough cover to get 
away. 

The BAR whacked away, al- 
though I had trouble keeping it ele- 
vated enough to bring the wavering 
stream of tracers onto the black ship. 
I heard the whine of rotors as Pop 
slid the pickup through the burning 
thicket and back up onto the road 
behind the burning oil. Then I came 
to the end of the belt, and I wished 
I had that 55 bazooka that was now 
— hopefully — rolling away from me 
at well over a hundred MPH. But 
I didn’t. I pulled the lazgun and 
crackled away at the black shape 
now hovering closer and closer over 
me, and I thought of Pop and Buzzy 
and^ Phyllis and the kids and Oxford 
and the election and the girl I’d al- 
most married, when I first went 
down to Washington in ’78. 

And then I don’t remember any 
more. Not a thing. 



VI 

T he first thing I became aware of 
— how much later I don’t know 
— was the fact that I was lying flat 
on my back, my head elevated from 
the hard surface under me by a 
lump on the back of my head the 
size of a turkey egg. It hurt like hell, 
and I rolled my head to one side to 
ease the pain. There was a quick 
rustling sound not far away, and I 
opened my eyes, expecting — I guess 
— to see some starchy nurse and 
maybe Buzzy on the next bed. 

But it wasn’t a hospital. Or if it 
was, I was blind. I contemplated that 
thought for a while and found little 
comfort in it. Then my other senses 
came into play, and I realized that 
hospitals don’t smell of chlorine and 
hospital beds are not entirely con- 
structed of cold, hard metal. 

I sat up, eyes straining in the 
blackness, and there was another 
rustle, a frantic scuttling sound 
which my imagination quickly trans- 
lated into something horrible. I was 
scared, and I sat motionless for a 
long while, breathing as quietly as I 
could. There were no more rustlings, 
but I could hear something else 
breathing, something breathing in 
short, shallow gasps, like a wounded 
animal. 

Something , I thought, with a high 
metabolism rate. 

/ should stay put, I thought. Noth- 
ing has hurt me yet, I thought. 

And even as I thought it, my cur- 
iosity got the better of me. Or may- 
be it was the fact that I can’t stand 
fear and uncertainty and prefer al- 
most any resolution, even an unfav- 



136

orable one, to continuing in doubt. 
I stretched out a hand in the dark- 
ness before me and touched some- 
thing round and soft and warm 
which seemed to shrink away from 
me with much rustling and an in- 
take of breath. 

I checked the sensation of that 
touch against the card file of touches 
every man has in his head and very 
quickly identified it. 

“I beg your pardon, Madam,” I 
said. “Could you be good enough to 
tell me where we are?” 

There was a gasp, much rustling, 
a fumble of arms around my neck, 
and I found a sobbing girl pressing 
her head against my chest. Her hair 
smelled good. 

“Oh thank God! Thank God! I 
thought you were one of them.” The 
girl shuddered in revulsion. 

I held her tightly until her sobbing 
stopped. Then, as if suddenly 
aware of me as an individual and not 
just a pleasanter alternative to 
“them”, she pulled away, and I 
heard more rustling. There was the 
snap of a purse and the frustrated 
rattle of lipstick and mirror. 
“Damn,” she said. “I must look aw- 
ful.” She sniffed once or twice as 
women do, when wiping their eyes. 

“I think you look just fine,” I said, 
gallantly ignoring the fact that we 
were in utter darkness. “Do you 
have any idea where we are?” 

“In their ship — I think.” 

“A big black job, kind of a flat- 
tened tear-drop shape?” 

“Uh huh.” She slid over against 
me again and fumbled for the secur- 
ity of my hand. 



“How long have you been here?” 
I asked. 

“I don’t know. It seems forever. 
Since Wednesday morning, however 
long ago that was.” 

I began to put two and two to- 
gether. “You own a white Jaguar?” 
“Yes! How did you know?” 

I told her about Buzzy and the 
carryall, about Jacobs and the can- 
nisters and our attempt* to get what 
was left of them back to our yard. 

“These cannisters,” she said when 
I had finished, “are they round, with 
rounded ends, like maybe sleeping- 
powder capsules?” 

“Yes. That’s a good description. 
But they’re about the size of three 
fifty-gallon oil drums laid end to 
end.” 

“That explains it then. They can’t 
talk, at least not so you can under- 
stand them, but they kept drawing 
pictures. I didn’t understand what 
they wanted, but they drew a lot of 
pictures of those capsule-shaped 
things.” The girl withdrew her hand 
— to gesture with I guess. 

We sat in silence for a while, and 
some of the awesomeness of our 
situation began to sink in on me. 
Funny, you can talk blithely about 
creatures from outer space, about 
spaceships and first contact, and 
other esoteric matters. The reality is 
a hell of a lot more mundane, and 
its most striking aspect is more than 
that most simple and basic of human 
emotions: fear. 

And then the girl told me how 
she had been driving along the 
Morgantown road, when the ship 
had appeared above her and settled 
on the road before her. She had 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



137 




stopped; a hatchway had opened in 
the side of the ship, and the next 
thing she had known, she had been 
lying in darkness, sliding about on 
the metal floor of our prison as the 
ship apparently went through violent 
maneuvers. 

“There’s light sometimes. Not 
much, a dim, red light, but enough 
to see by. They showed me their silly 
pictures, but I didn’t understand 
them. Once they handed me the 
tablet and a funny-kind of pencil 
thing, and I wrote my name over and 
over again, but all they did was 
waggle their arms at each other and 
draw more capsules and meaningless 
pictures. 

“Then it was dark and then it 
was that funny kind of dim red 
light again. And there was a lot of 
flying around. Three times since I 
came here.” 

“That would have been the attacks 
on Buzzy, on old man Jacobs and 
on Pop and me.” 

“But if what they want is those 
capsules — cannisters — why didn’ t 
they just go get them from that man’s 
junk yard? Why did they have to 
wreck your brother’s carryall and kill 
that man and go after you and your 
father?” 

I thought a bit. “I don’t know, 
Miss . .” 

“Berenson. My name is Claudia 
Berenson.” ^ 

“. .* I don’t know, Miss'fieren- 
son. Maybe it has something to do 
With the blackness in here. Maybe 
they can’t see by the kind of light 
we see by. Maybe they can’t tell 
where the cannisters are until they’re 
in motion, or something.” 



W e were silent again for a mo- 
ment. Miss Berenson — Claud- 
ia — snuggled up close to me again, 
and I put a protective arm around 
her. She could have been any age, in 
the darkness, and ugly as sin. But 
from what I could feel and the sound 
of her voice, I had a hunch she was 
no old crone. 

Then, as much because we were 
afraid as anything else, we started to 
talk, to tell each other about our- 
selyes. She told me what it was like 
to be a fashion buye'r for a big chain 
of women’s stores, about how her 
brother had died during the Austra- 
lian campaign, about going to school 
in Albany, New York, about her first 
date and how funny it had been, 
about the apartment she shared with 
two other twenty-five-year-olds in 
Manhattan, about her unhappy love 
affair in ’84. 

Darkness is a wonderful aid to 
confession, and I found myself talk- 
ing about Australia and Oxford and 
the Party and the junk business and 
about my unhappy affair with Julia 
in Washington, and I discovered all 
of a sudden that talking about Julia 
didn’t hurt anymore. Despite the 
mystery and threat of our strange 
meeting, I found myself cheered at 
the absence of old pain and the 
promise of . something new. 

I was almost disappointed when 
the dim red lights suddenly came to 
life. As my eyes adjusted I was able 
to see what our prison consisted of. 
We occupied a kind of transparent 
bubble enclosing a roughly hemis- 
pherical space, perhaps a dozen feet 
across at its widest point. 

It looked like it had been jury- 

IF 



138 




rigged from some sort of plastic ma- 
terial just to contain us; I could see 
where the edges of the bubble were 
crudely but effectively fused against 
the deck, against what I took to be 
the outer wall of the ship and against 
a rear transverse bulkhead. A cylin- 
drical duct a few inches across led 
from the bubble to the ceiling, bring- 
ing sweet West Virginia summer air 
into us and offsetting the stench of 
chlorine. 

The space into which our bubble 
intruded conformed roughly to the 
forward half of the flattened tear- 
drop ship, I had last seen hovering 
over the Morgantown road. Perhaps 
thirty feet at its widest and sixty feet 
long, it tapered from a rounded 
prow back to the flat bulkhead, sep- 
arating, I supposed, the crew’s living 
and control area from that portion of 
the ship containing its drive mechan- 
ism and whatever cargo space could 
now be presumed to contain all but 
twenty of old man Jacobs’ two hun- 
dred and twenty cannisters. 

There were no windows or ports, 
but a row of flickering screens on 
the inner side of the curved prow 
gave a curiously distorted picture of 
woodland and hill. The ship — if the 
screens were correct — seemed to be 
nestled into one of the wilder groves 
that dot the northern West Virginia 
countryside. 

All of this, of course, I observed 
in detail later. My attention was in- 
itially riveted on the four figures 
now climbing down from crude wire- 
like racks suspended from the ceiling 
of the craft. Claudia shuddered be- 
side me, and I gathered that these 
were “them.” 



I couldn’t blame her for shudder- 
ing. They looked pretty bad, and I 
wouldn’t have found them substan- 
tially more appealing even had I 
known they were all registered vot- 
ers in the 14th district. Maybe eight 
or nine feet tall, they were vaguely 
human in that there was a recog- 
nizable head and trunk. But, there 
the resemblance ceased. 

There were far too. many arms 
and legs, and each was tipped with 
a writhing collection of small, pulpy 
tentacles. These “fingers” and 
“toes” seemed to obey their own- 
er’s commands to grasp a stanchion 
or turn a dial, but when their serv- 
ices were not otherwise engaged, 
they danced and waved with a weird 
life of their own. It was hard to tell 
colors in the red light, but our wrig- 
gling captors seemed to be covered 
with some sort of hard, chitinous 
material, its shimmering surface 
broken only by two slashes of bright 
cloth-like stuff, one draped across 
the chest and another bound about 
the uppermost “arm” on the left 
side. There is a kind of universal 
principle of clothing, and I would 
have bet my chances of ever getting 
out of there that one chunk of cloth 
indicated rank or status and the 
other covered whatever passed for 
pudenda among our chitinous 
friends. 

As a sometime lawyer, I am not 
unschooled in the rules of evidence, 
the logical process of putting two 
and two together to make four, twen- 
ty-two, or 1,111, as the case and the 
nature of the jury demand. Hence I 
was puzzled by the great discrep- 
ancy between the physical confor- 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



139 




mation of our captors and the ship 
and its outfitting. The chairs in front 
of the screens at the prow of the 
ship were mansized, not “thing” 
sized; there was a contour couch vis- 
ible to us, and the contour was not 
that of a “thing”. 

So far as I could tell, the switches 
and knobs, the door handles and 
lock mechanisms, the height of var- 
ious indicating instruments all 
seemed designed for some creature 
other than the “things.” Specifically, 
it looked like the mysterious ship 
had been — or was designed to be 
— occupied by a two-legged two- 
armed biped, like say, you or me. 
I puzzled over this for a bit. And 
then two and two added up to sug- 
gest that the “things” had not come 
by their ship honestly. I filed this 
assumption for future use. 

VII 

M y ruminations came to an end. 

One of our captors donned a 
transparent helmet, for all the world 
like an inverted fish-bowl, and 
slipped his uppermost arms and one 
leg through a harness containing 
what must have been gas bottles of 
some sort. He passed out of our field 
of vision through a hatchway in the 
rear bulkhead and reappeared a 
moment later through a lock mech- 
anism leading into our bubble from 
the same bulkhead, bringing with 
him a puff of chlorine. We coughed 
and choked for a moment until the 
lock had closed behind him. Claudia 
skittered behind me, as I rose to 
meet him. There was none of that 
“take me to your leader” business. 



Instead our visitor gave out with a 
scratching, whistling noise — like a 
fingernail across a blackboard — and 
looked at me expectantly with sev- 
eral wide-set, many-faceted eyes. 
When neither of us reacted to his 
greeting with a similar sound, he 
gave an unmistakable shrug — a ges- 
ture which also must be well nigh 
universal, but one which is formid- 
able when performed by a column 
of three shoulders. Then came the 
tablet and pencil. 

First there was a picture of the 
ship and under it a series of curved 
symbols unlike anything I’d ever 
seen. The thing in the helmet point- 
ed to the ship with one set of 
bunched tentacles and drew another 
bunch, stiffly gathered into a point- 
er, across the line of symbols. 

“Wheeskrick,” it said. 

I bowed slightly, stabbed a fore- 
finger at my chest and said; “Perci- 
val Sansoni.” 

The Wheeskrick chattered and 
whistled and handed me the tablet 
and scriber. I’d read a lot of science 
fiction and I figured I knew just 
what to do. I drew a circle and ten 
smaller circles in orbit around it. 
With an air of triumph and a proud 
eye cast toward Claudia, I placed a 
large X through the third circle out 
from the center. 

The Wheeskrick whistled and 
squeaked again, took the tablet and 
scriber from me with two jellyfish- 
like tentacles and lashed me a good 
one across the chops with a third. 
The language lesson was over, and 
he was impatient with my attempts 
at rudimentary cosmography. 

I staggered back before him, 

IF 



140 




mindful of the girl beside me and 
the necessity for belting him one in 
return. But I didn’t know where to 
start in, and anyway, he was busy 
scribbling again. It was another pic- 
ture of the black, flattened-teardrop 
ship, this time with a jagged hole in 
its side and little black Wheeskricks 
unloading cannisters from a hatch- 
way onto a neat stack under what 
was quite clearly a tree. 

The Wheeskrick chittered and 
whistled; the picture disappeared and 
was replaced with another display- 
ing a crudely-drawn man loading 
cannisters onto a carryall, while be- 
hind a straight line, apparently rep- 
resenting the side of the ship, four 
Wheeskricks lay supine in complex 
wire racks. I began to get the pic- 
ture. 

The Wheeskrick manipulated 
something on the tablet, and die pic- 
ture disappeared again; he began to 
draw another: a carryall lying on its 
side, crumpled but recognizable, and 
two Wheeskricks loading cannisters 
into their ship. Off to one side, the 
Wheeskrick painstakingly drew two 
stacks of cannisters, each stack 
twenty-one cannisters long and five 
high. He blacked in the last four 
rows of five with his stylus — the 
twenty cannisters not yet recovered. 

Whisding and screeching, he 
drew another series of inexplicable 
symbols under the twenty blackened 
cannisters and translated them for 
me by reaching out with his middle- 
right-hand arm and belting me again, 
this time hard enough to knock me 
up against the inner surface of our 
bubble prison. Without so much as 
a parting whistle, he wheeled on 



three feet, tucked his tablet under his 
upper left-hand arm and exited 
through the lock, leaving us once 
again gasping and choking in the 
fumes of the atmosphere he entered. 

C laudia knelt beside me and 
crooned over me, and although 
I wasn’t really hurt by the WHeesk- 
rick’s blow, I groaned a little bit for 
effect. The dim light Was perfectly 
sufficient to show me — beside the 
nature of our prison, the reaches of 
the interior of the Wheeskrick ship 
and the creeping horror of the 
Wheeskricks themselves — the de- 
lightfut fact that Claudia Berenson 
was a real looker, the kind of girl 
men dream about crooning over 
them when they have fallen honor- 
ably (and not fatally) on the field of 
combat. 

But that wasn’t getting us out of 
there. I stopped groaning, sat up and 
started thinking. The Wheeskrick’s 
pictures had been pretty clear. So 
had his blows. Old man Jacobs must 
have stumbled on the Wheeskrick’s 
cargo, when they had off-loaded it 
to repair some trouble in their ship. 
He’d swiped it during one of the 
sleep periods, sold it the way he sold 
other hot goods — quickly and cheap- 
ly — and now the Wheeskricks were 
doing all they could to recover it. 

I began to get curious about what 
was in those cannisters, more cur- 
ious than I had been before. What- 
ever it was, though, it was amply 
clear that the Wheeskricks wanted it 
back, wanted those other twenty 
cannisters and were prepared to 
knock me around until they found 
out where they were.

Well hell! They could have them. 




They’d cost too many human lives 




already. The problem was, how do 




you let go of a tiger when he has 




you by the tail? 




Claudia had been thinking too. 




She had been in our cage a lot longer

than I, with nothing to eat or drink, 
and there was a note of panic in her

voice. 


“All they seem to want are their 




silly cannisters. Can’t you tell them 
where they are? Maybe they’ll let 
us go then.” 


if 


I thought about the possibility. 
Then I thought about what they had 
done to Ed and Billy and to the old 
man, Jacobs, and what they might 
do if they got to Pop’s junk yard. 
I’d seen a lot of killing in Australia, 
some of it performed with the cas-

but nothing to rival the way old 
man Jacobs had looked. Or Ed Vick- 
ers. 

I shook my head. “I don’t think 
they’d let us go. I think we’re like 
some kind of annoying wildlife to 
them; I think they’d as soon kill us 
as look at us. Those missing twenty 
cannisters are the only reason you 
and I are alive now.” 

“But what can we doV The panic 
in Claudia’s voice advanced a half 
a dozen spaces toward “go”. 

“I don’t know,” I said. “Let me 
think.” 

While I was thinking, Claudia sat 
with her head back against the bub- 
ble, too frightened to sleep, too 
weary to look about her any more. 
I tested the walls, probing at the 
transparent plastic with my pen- 
knife. They were slightly flexible, 




and I could penetrate the surface 
with my knife. But all I got for my 
pains was a whiff of chlorine, and I 
realized that we’d suffocate long be- 
fore I could chop a hole big enough 
to let us escape. And even then, we 
would escape only into the Wheesk- 
rick’s chlorine-filled control room. 

I n the meantime, our captors were 
busy. One of them cycled his 
way out through a lock in the wall 
opposite our cage — his helmet and 
gas cylinders in place — while two 
others busied themselves assembling 
dozens of small tripod affairs, each 
a hand high and two hands across 
the base. When they had finished, 
the two went back through the after 
bulkhead and reappeared with one 
of the cannisters. One by one they 
tested the tripods by waving each 
toward the cannister. There were 
bright blips on the screen before the 
fourth Wheeskrick. 

An hour after he had left, the 
Wheeskrick with the helmet returned, 
a struggling calf in his arms. The 
Wheeskricks dragged the strangling 
animal over to our bubble and pro- 
ceeded to disassemble it before our 
eyes. I had a sobbing girl, her head 
buried in my shoulder again, to con- 
tend with. The obvious instructional 
session of the Wheeskricks was not 
lost on me, and I began to think even 
harder. 

But I didn’t come up with any- 
thing. Not for a while. There was 
another sleep period of complete 
darkness and another period of dim 
red light, during which three of the 
four Wheeskricks disappeared 
through the outer lock, their arms

loaded with the little tripod detec- 
tion devices. 

I could see what would lie ahead; 
I’d watched men break in Australia. 
There would be hunger and — judg- 
ing from what had already occurred 
— some more abuse. Then would 
come the time when they’d start in 
on Claudia, maybe like the calf, and 
I’d begin to think that perhaps if I 
started doing some fancy drawing on 
their tablet for them they’d let us go 
and maybe not hurt Buzzy and Phyl- 
lis and the kids and Pop. Just take 
their damn cannisters and go. That’s 
what I’d begin to think after a while, 
and I knew I’d be wrong. The dim 
red light winked out for the second 
time, and I thought even harder. 

I had long since assayed my 
pockets and found nothing other 
than some loose change, my pen- 
knife, and my fuel-less lighter. I gave 
Claudia a try. 

“What do you have in your 
purse?” 

“Why ... I don’t know. A few 
dollars, my comb, some cosmetics.” 

“Dump it out,” I said, “and tell 
me item by item what’s in it.” 

There was a clatter, like a slot 
machine paying off, and Claudia be- 
gan to finger her possessions in the 
blackness to identify them. 

“Let’s see. There’s a comb, lip- 
stick, mirror, . uh . four, no 
five bobby pins, compact, eye pen- 
cil, one, two, three, four, five, six 
. six coins, a can of hairspray, 
billfold, a couple of . uh . 
stamps, I guess, a box of aspirin tab- 
lets, car keys, apartment keys, nail 
file, a screw thingumajiggy out of 
my radio that I’ve got to get a new 



one of, subway pass, handkerchief, 
two . three coughdrops, master 
credit card, and . .” Claudia broke 
off. 

“And what?” I asked. I should 
have known better. 

“Uh ... a box of . uh . 
contraceptive pills.” 

“Oh.” I said. 

It didn’t look like a very promising 
collection, but I added it to my men- 
tal assay of my own pockets, and we 
lapsed into silence. 

T hen I had it. It was a long shot. 

I didn’t know if it would work, 
or if it did, whether we would sur- 
vive it or not. But I remembered that 
calf and old man Jacobs and Ed 
Vickers, and I figured it was worth 
the chance. 

The dim red light came on again, 
and the Wheeskricks began to clam- 
ber down from their wire perches. 
I pulled Claudia to her feet. 

“Pull your collar up around your 
ears and stand up as close to the 
outside wall as you can.” I thought 
a moment and stripped my jacket 
off and draped it over her head. “I’m 
going to try to blow us out of here, 
and if it works, get a good lung full 
of air and get to that outer lock as 
fast as you can. I think the top but- 
ton makes it open.” 

She nodded dumbly and did as she 
was bid. I watched the Wheeskricks. 
One of them had donned his fish- 
bowl and tanks and was headed back 
toward the entrance to our bubble. 

I fished the can of hairspray from 
Claudia’s purse and depressed the 
plunger on top. The small bubble 
began to fill with scent and with 



144 



IF 




finely atomized particles of highly 
flammable lacquer. I heard the in- 
ner lock door start to open just as 
the spray can fizzed out of gas. I 
joined Claudia at the wall, fished my 
fuelless lighter from my pocket, 
held it as far behind my back as I 
could, shouted “hold your breath!” 
and thumbed the striker. 

There was a whoosh of flame and 
a thumping explosion. The entering 
Wheeskrick never knew what hit 
him. The plastic walls of our prison 
blew out like an over-inflated bal- 
loon, and the shirt sleeve over my 
right arm burned with a merry 
flame. I ignored it and propelled 
Claudia before me through the rup- 
tured bubble toward the outer lock. 

One of the Wheeskricks brushed 
past us, headed to aid his colleague 
in the ruined bubble lock, confident 
that his buddy — who was approach- 
ing us as only a nine-foot, six-legged 
wheeskrick can — would make short 
work of me. I was pretty confident 
he could too, but I figured Claudia, 
at least, might make it. The fourth 
Wheeskrick never budged from his 
position in front of the detection 
screens, which shows the relative 
priority the Wheeskricks put on re- 
covering the rest of those cannisters. 

Claudia reached the outer lock, 
hammered ’ the uppermost button 
with her fist, and the door started to 
swing inward. I was making full 
speed toward her, my lungs burst- 
ing and eyes streaming from the 
chlorine, when a tentacled limb 
caught me on my burned right arm 
and the massive weight of the 
Wheeskrick brought me up short. I 
let his pull swing me in a short arc, 



and I brought my left fist around in 
an old style haymaker, knuckle out, 
aimed for the center of the patch of 
yellow cloth on the Wheeskrick’s 
chest. If Sansoni’s Universal Theory 
of Clothing were wrong, I would do 
him little damage. You may wound 
a soldier in his pride if you shoot 
him in the epaulette, but you reallly 
stop him if you get him in the pants. 

The theory proved correct. There 
was agonized screeching and whist- 
ling, and I tore myself loose from 
his writhing grasp and leapt the last 
few feet to the open door of the 
lock. Claudia slammed the door be- 
hind me; the pumps cycled swiftly, 
and we lay gasping and choking in 
the sweet afternoon air. I was dizzy, 
but I figured the Wheeskricks 
couldn’t open the inner lock door 
until the outer was closed, at least 
not for a while, and with the last of 
my strength I ripped one of Claud- 
ia’s shoes off her foot and wedged its 
heel into the crack between the outer 
door and its jamb. I wanted to make 
sure that door stayed open until we 
felt like leaving there. 

VIII 

W e lay gasping and retching for 
several minutes in the mouth 
of the strange ship’s airlock, and 
then it occurred to me that the 
Wheeskricks would soon be out af- 
ter us. They had helmets and gas 
bottles, and no doubt there was some 
way of getting that inner door open 
without closing the outer one. 

“Come on, Claudia, we’ve got to 
get out of here.” 

Claudia choked, slipped her other 

145 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 




shoe off and slid with me over the 
lip of the lock and dropped the 
three or four feet to the ground. 
We’d taken only two or three steps 
toward the dense woods which sur- 
rounded the Wheeskrick ship when 
a bright pencil of light sprang from 
somewhere above and behind us 
and a fresh, green juniper a few 
inches before my nose burst into 
flame. I pulled Claudia back into the 
shadowed swell of the ship’s flank. 

“Looks like they don’t want us to 
leave,” I said. Claudia began to sob 
quietly. I felt a little like it myself. 
It looked as if we had jumped splen- 
didly out of the frying pan and in- 
to the fire. I slid down beside Claud- 
ia on the grass, threw a well-done 
right arm around her quaking shoul- 
ders and started to think again. 

I thought very hard. We take 
three steps out of the shadow of the 
ship where their damn screens can 
pick us up, and ZAP, they burn us 
down. We wait here , and they'll 
come out after us , and this time — 
outside the ship — they won't he shy 
about using their weapons . 

We were damned if we did and 
damned if we didn’t. 

Then I remembered something 
out of OCS. The old, grizzled in- 
fantry officer who lectured us: “If 
you find yourself on foot against an 
enemy taijk, the safest place to be is 
up on the tank. They can’t get you 
thqre, but there is always a chance 
you can get them.” 

I pulled Claudia to her feet and 
then in best platoon-leader style 
said: “Follow me!” We skirted 

around the swelling of the ship to- 
ward the rear, where the tear-drop 



diminished to a series of blackened 
tubes, apparently the business end 
of the ship’s drive mechanism. I 
boosted Claudia ahead of me, up the 
tube mouths, until we were both on 
hands and knees on the pitted up- 
per surface of the ship. I could see 
the slightly elevated turret from 
which the ship’s lazbeams were pro- 
jected, but even if their basic sensor 
system were in the same turret, they 
would not dare fire at us without 
running the risk of scorching their 
own tail. 

We advanced on the turret. I 
rather cavalierly swatted Claudia on 
the fanny when she let it elevate 
too much; we would be far ahead if 
we could take them by surprise. Af- 
ter a hundred feet of abrasive crawl- 
ing we had reached the turret, and 
I could see the objectives of the 
ship’s sensors. There were six of 
them, each — I would suppose — with 
a sixty-degree coverage of the area 
around the ship. We kept low, be- 
neath the muzzles of the lazbeam 
projectors, and I pulled that pre- 
cious, junk-laden purse from Claud- 
ia’s shoulder. There was a lipstick, 
and it was only a moment’s work to 
obscure the objectives of the ship’s 
eyes with a thick, greasy layer of die 
stuff. Like Pop says, one man’s junk 
is another man’s salvation. 

We took the quick way down, slid- 
ing and scraping across the sharp 
prow and dropping the last eight or 
ten feet to the grass of the clearing. 
We didn’t pause. Three leaps and 
we were on the verge of the woods. 
Another scrub crackled into flame a 
yard away, and I turned to see one 
of the Wheeskricks in the lock en- 



146 



IF 




trance, a weapon in his hand. We 
ran on. 

A fter ten minutes, Claudia was 
breathing like a broken piston, 
and I wasn’t in much better shape. 
We went to ground, and I could 
hear the Wheeskrick thrashing 
around in the underbrush a hundred 
yards away. But now we were in 
our element, not his. We lay silently, 
and he passed us by, half blind in 
the high actinic light of our sun, 
laboring under the drag of his breath- 
ing apparatus. 

We lay like that, Claudia’s head 
pillowed on my shoulder, for hours. 
I figured with what I had observed 
of the Wheeskrick’s vision, we 
weren’t much better off in the night 
than in the day, but we needed the 
rest; Claudia — now three days 
without food or water — was in 
bad shape. 

At dusk, while she slept, I worked 
my way slowly around to a thick 
wild grape growing up a nearby pine, 
severed a three foot chunk of it, 
and brought it back to her. She drank 
greedily from the hollow core and 
rested; I figured she would be good 
for an hour or two of travel. Our 
ace in the hole was those twenty 
cannisters. As> long as they weren’t 
moved, the Wheeskricks couldn’t find 
them — or so I hoped. And if 
Claudia and I could make the thirty 
miles to my home and Pop’s ingenu- 
ity and those cannisters, we might 
have a fighting chance. 

We kept off the roads until we 
reached the outskirts of Carson’s 
Corners, which are about a nine- 
iron shot from the inskirts. There is 



a truck stop in Carson’s Corners, 
and I slicked my hair into some 
semblance of order and went in alone 
and bought a sack of hamburgers to 
go. We hunched together in the 
shadows behind the stop and ate 
greedily, while I watched for a 
chance to steal a ductor. I hatedr to 
do it, but I figured we could square 
it later, and my first assumption was 
that the Wheeskricks would 'be look- 
ing for two people on foot. 

I toyed with the idea of calling the 
Highway Patrol, but when I thought 
of the problem of trying to convince 
anybody who hasn’t seen the 
Wheeskrick ship that there was such 
a horror loose in the county, I gave 
up. Even if I could convince them, 
what could they do? 

A middle-aged couple parked their 
’84 Buick with its turbine still turning 
and headed for the rest rooms. I 
bundled Claudia through the door 
and crept silently out of the parking 
lot and onto the highway. At the 
edge of town I waited until a truck- 
er pulled out toward Morgantown 
and drove in the shadow of his tail- 
gate into and through that metropo- 
lis. My second assumption was that 
the Wheeskricks could very well be 
up there a few hundred feet in the 
air, their black ship all but invisible, 
prepared to jump any single car go- 
ing down that road alone. 

Outside of Morgantown, the 
trucker turned off on the Washing- 
ton Pike, and I drifted to the side 
of the road under a spreading maple. 
We waited until midnight, but noth- 
ing else came along. I could feel 
that black ship up there, detectors 
alert, waiting for something to pass

down the road. Then somewhere be- 
hind us, on the outskirts of Morgan- 
town I suppose, a drive-in theater let 
out. For a few minutes the road was 
crowded with ductors, and I swung 
out into the midst of them and let 
them convoy us all the way to Pop’s 
yard. I parked the stolen ductor be- 
hind the pile of defective zinc cof- 
fins, which graces the area between 
the road and the house, and sat there 
for a while, too weak to move. 

After a bit, I helped Claudia out 
of the ductor and into the house. 
Buzzy was home and so was Pop. 
Phyllis came down in curlers and a 
robe. 

We must have looked a sight. 
“Jeez! Perce,” said Buzzy. 

“My lord, son!” said Pop. 

“Oh you poor thing,” said Phyllis, 
reaching out to Claudia. 

“Pop!” I said, lapsing into my 
childhood West Virginia speech, 
“don’t move them goddamn cannis- 
ters! Not an inch!” 

And then I dropped where I stood. 
I guess I was pretty tired. 

IX 

T he real secret of Pop’s success 
as a junk dealer — apart from 
the philosophy and principles I have 
already described — lay in his genius 
for putting two or more pieces of 
useless machinery together into 
something that would bring a big 
price. Pop had a reputation all up 
and down the Eastern Seaboard, and 
the way it worked was this: 

Suppose a widget manufacturer in 
Brockton, Massachusetts, gets a sud- 
den rush order for a million biform- 



ed widgets with knobs on to be de- 
livered (under time penalty) within 
sixty days. His production capacity 
is based almost entirely on the num- 
ber of fully-automated widget-mak- 
ing machines he has in service. 
And if he hasn’t got enough to al- 
low him to fill the lucrative order, or 
if one of his machines is broken 
down and can’t be repaired in time, 
before he says “no” to the order, he 
gives Pop a call. 

“Mr. Sansoni, can you haywire to- 
gether a widget-maker with a 400 
widget per hour capacity? I’ll need 
it by Tuesday.” 

Maybe Pop has never heard of a 
widget, but he always answers in the 
same way. “Sure. Send me the prints 
and tell me how long it’s gotta last.” 
And that’s Pop’s secret. Send him 
the blueprints for a widget-machine, 
and he’ll make you a widget-machine 
— out of junk. It may not be a very 
efficient widget-machine and it may 
not last a hell of a lot longer than 
the requirements of the job (although 
it’s surprising how many improve- 
ment patents Pop has sold — meta- 
phorically speaking — to widget- 
machine manufacturers), but the 
widget man gets something that will 
do the job, and Pop turns low-cost 
junk into high-priced industrial ma- 
chinery. 

That’s why we have an 8000 foot 
landing strip out back of the yard. 
My earliest memories are of great 
cargo aircraft lumbering into that 
strip to pick up some complex piece 
of haywire Pop had spent the night 
crating for shipment. Of course, now 
the strip is mostly weeds and scrub 
pine; the flitters don’t need anything 



148 



IF 




like that kind of space to lift off 
from. 

Anyway, as you can see from all 
this, I wasn’t much use in the real 
operation of the family business. 
Sure, I could help out occasionally 
with a bit of v/iring, and I wasn’t 
bad with a cutting laser. But next to 
Pop and Buzzy I was all thumbs, and 
I didn’t have that trick of seeing 
how you could take the turbine from 
a ’79 Olds, two refrigeration units 
mounted back to back, the fusion 
chamber from a field generating 
plant, and most of the guts from a 
surplus radar set and put them all 
together into a workable widget 
maker. Besides, I’d been gone too 
long and I didn’t know where any- 
thing was anymore. And in a junk 
yard the size of ours, that’s as im- 
portant as anything else. 

And that’s why it was that I found 
myself working as combination book- 
keeper and purchasing agent for the 
business, along with handling Pop’s 
occasional legal problems. Pop didn’t 
mind giving up the bookkeeping, but 
he hated to miss out on the fun of 
acquisition. Still, he and Buzzy had 
all they could handle right there in 
the yard, and I started running 
around to surplus auctions, plant 
dismantlings, 'and other junk yards 
— like old man Jacobs’ — bidding 
on this and that, doing my bit to 
Keep the Stock Up, 

I hadn’t given up on my political 
career. Not by a damn sight. But 
my only chance was to run as an 
independent for the Senate seat that 
would be up for grabs in the fall of 
’86. I have a good name in the state, 
and I figured that if I could run a 



big enough campaign, I could be 
pretty sure to beat both the regular 
Party candidates, which would go a 
long way toward breaking the power 
of the courthouse gang that had 
tossed me out. 

But such a campaign takes money, 
lots of it. I figured I had about a 
year to earn it, and a third share in 
the family profits — unfair to Pop 
and Buzzy as it was — seemed like 
the best way to go about it. I didn’t 
really have much hope that I would 
be able to accumulate even half what 
I would need to do the job right, 
but I had to make the try with what- 
ever resources I could muster. 

Sometimes, after a long day pass- 
ing out my own campaign literature 
to uninterested housewives at some 
shopping center or shaking hands 
with too many limp individuals at 
some surplus auction, I felt like I 
was more of a junk man than Pop 
ever was, trying to salvage something 
useful out of the old rags and bones 
that my political career had become. 

F unny thing about the sleep of 
total exhaustion. When I awoke 
the morning after our escape from 
the Wheeskricks, my mind was full 
of campaign worries, thoughts about 
speeches and posters and 3-D time 
and how I was going to pay for it 
all. And then I came fully awake, 
heard voices outside my window, 
and the full memory of the events 
of the past three days came rushing 
in on me., 

I dragged myself out of bed, a 
little surprised to find that I wasn’t 
a good deal more stiff and sore than 
I was, and peeked out the window. 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



149 




A State Trooper was driving off in 
the ductor I’d swiped the night be- 
fore, and I could hear Pop explain- 
ing to another Trooper something 
about “them no-good juvenile delin- 
quents” and how they must have 
abandoned it here and so forth. Pop 
is not without imagination in a pinch. 

I showered and shaved and went 
down to the veranda, letting my nose 
guide me to the stacks of flapjacks 
and bacon there. The kids were al- 
ready off playing in the coffins in 
the front yard, and Pop was just 
coming in from his talk with the 
Troopers. Claudia, despite her three- 
day ordeal, looked fresh — like a 
million dollars in small, unmarked 
bills — and she was helping Phyllis 
turn out the flapjacks and bacon. 

Funny thing. We didn’t say any- 
thing at all to each other at first. 
She just turned toward me from the 
stove and kind of lifted her arms, 
and before either of us quite knew 
what we were doing, I had my arms 
around her and she had hers around 
my neck and we kissed. I guess it 
lasted a pretty long time. 

Buzzy was grinning. Phyllis look- 
ed like she was going to cry a little 
bit. Pop looked mildly disgusted. 
“When you’re all done, Perce,” he 
said, “I’d ’predate it if you could 
tell us where’n hell you been since 
I last seen ypu on the Morgantown 
road.” 

I flushed a little bit and looked at 
Claudia. She was cool as a cucumber 
and went back to slicing bread and 
feeding it into the toaster. 

I filled in Pop and Buzzy between 
bites of flapjack. I told them about 
the Wheeskrick ship and the Wheesk- 



ricks and how it looked like they 
didn’t really fit in their ship some- 
how. I told them about how old 
Jacobs had swiped the cannisters and 
about my theory that the Whees- 
kricks couldn’t see very well in our 
light and depended on their detection 
system to locate the cannisters. I 
wound up by stating the problem as 
I saw it: getting the cannisters back 
to the Wheeskricks without incurring 
a visit from them. I guess I had in 
mind some sort of remote-controlled 
ductor we could send off down the 
road loaded with the twenty cannis- 
ters. 

Pop’s look of disgust deepened. 
“I ain’t about to give them things 
nothin’,” he said. “Not after what 
they done to you and Buzzy and 
poor old Ed and Billy.” 

“But Pop,” I said, “those cannis- 
ters belong to the Wheeskricks. And 
anyway, you can’t very well call up 
the Highway Patrol and expect them 
to believe anything as wild as this.” 

“I ain’t goin’ to call up nobody,” 
said Pop. “And as far as the cannis- 
ters belonging to the Wheeskricks, 
didn’t you say it looked like they 
didn’t really fit in that ship? Like 
maybe it was built for someone else? 
I bet they highjacked that ship just 
like they coldcaulked Buzzy here.” 

I got legalistic and quoted some- 
thing out of Blackstone to the effect 
that two wrongs don’t make a right 
and that even if the cannisters were 
stolen property (several times, that 
is: the Wheeskricks stole them from 
some rightful owner, and Jacobs 
stole them from the Wheeskricks), 
we still didn’t have any legal title 
to them.

IF 




P op thought a minute. “All right, 
Perce. You want it nice and 
legal. I know a little sumpin’ about 
the Law. What do you call it when 
a guy unloads cargo on your proper- 
ty and has to pay for storage?” 
“Demurrage,” I said. 

“Yeah,” said Pop, a note of tri- 
umph in his voice. “And what hap- 
pens if he don’t pay when he un- 
loads his stuff?” 

“Well,” I said, “under the Law 
Merchant, the wharf owner can 
claim up to the value of the goods 
for non-payment, providing . .” 
“See!” said Pop, fairly cackling in 
triumph. “Them’s our cannisters un- 
til some court decides different, and 
I’ll bet anything it’s up to the Whees- 
krioks to take it to court, certainly 
not us.” 

“My God, Pop, you can’t apply 
common law to a situation like 
this.” 

Pop paid no attention. “And just 
think what them cannisters must be 
worth!” 

The word “worth” struck a respon- 
sive chord in me, and the legalisms 
began to give way to shyster isms. I 
needed money, and this could be 
the windfall that would pay the print- 
ing bills and maybe buy some 3-D 
time, and . And maybe it was 

sheer rationalization, but the memo- 
ry of that tank-truck driver sudden- 
ly arose in my mind. It seemed to be 
a fixed part of the Wheeskricks’ 
modus operandi to set up a violently 
constructed roadblock whenever they 
wanted to intercept cannisters on 
the move. My idea of a remote-con- 
trolled ductor would be almost sure 
to cost at least one more life. 



I became very silent as Pop and 
Buzzy began to talk about ways and 
means of moving the cannisters 
without activating the Wheeskrick 
detection system. 

As they talked I became aware of 
Claudia again, and I broke into 
their technical plotting. 

“All right,” I said. “I’ll go along 
with you. But you better figure from 
the start that the only way to get 
out of this in one piece is to suck 
those birds in and eliminate them, 
and if there’s going to be that kind 
of rough stuff around here, we bet- 
ter plan on getting Phyllis and the 
kids and Claudia the hell out of 
here.” 

For a change, Pop and Buzzy 
agreed with me, and the three of us 
started to hatch plans which would 
get the women and kids off the 
premises. 

Phyllis responded first with a sweet 
and dulcit: “Cut the crap, Buzzy, 
I’m not going anywhere.” 

Buzzy subsided meekly. 

Claudia just looked at me and 
grinned. “Now Claudia,” I said, 
“there’s no reason in the world . .” 
My voice trailed off. 

Pop looked at Buzzy, and then 
he looked at me. The look of disgust 
on his face deepened. “When your 
mother was alive, why when I said 
something, she . .” Pop stopped 
and shook his head. “Keerist,” he 
said and went back to drawing dia- 
grams on the table top. Claudia and 
Phyllis started cackling at each other 
and resumed their work at the sink. 
For a lawyer who was once pretty 
good at trial work, I was not batting 
very well that day.

X 

B y noon the Wheeskricks problem 
was still without a solution, but 
Pop had shrouded the parked pick- 
up containing the cannisters with 
several layers of copper screening, 
carefully grounded to the pickup 
frame, just in case the cannisters 
were radiating something the Whees- 
kricks could detect. 

Pop and Buzzy argued most of 
the morning on the best way to 
get the W^heeskrieks. Buzzy was in 
favor of rigging the pickup for re- 
mote control as I had suggested and 
then laying for the Wheeskricks ship 
with a couple of 75 mm recoilless 
rifles. But I piped up about the 
women and kids and said I wouldn’t 
have anything to do with a shooting 
match. Pop just grunted and gave 



Buzzy his pitying look. “I ain’t never 
had no chance to get me a space 
ship before and I ain’t about to shoot 
this one full of holes.” 

Then they debated running a 
heavy cable out into the boondocks 
well away from the house and wir- 
ing the cannisters good and hot to 
ground. Pop almost bought that one, 
until I pointed out that while we 
might fry the first couple of Whees- 
kricks who caught the loading de- 
tail, it’d still leave one or two in- 
side to fight back, burn up the coun- 
tryside with their lazbeams or, at the 
very least, shag on out of there when 
their buddies got cooked. 

That stumped us for a while, and 
you could see the gloom gathering. 
To lighten things a bit I suggested 
that maybe what we needed to get 
all the Wheeskricks out of their ship

IF 





at once was a good supply of lady 
Wheeskricks. Nobody laughed. Pop 
said: “The way you described ’em, 
how do you know they ain’t already 
lady Wheeskricks?” 

He had me there, and the gloom 
deepened. 

We sat there like three dummies 
while the women busied themselves 
in the kitchen with lunch. I wanted 
to be done with the whole thing, to 
take 'Claudia and shove off for far 
places where there were no life-or- 
death problems. With Claudia there, 
and the promise of what might be, 
I was even losing some of my des- 
pair about the election. Some of it, 
but not all. 

Then Pop got his idea. Phyllis was 
pulling and heaving on the long din- 
ing table on the veranda, trying 
to pull it apart so that an extra leaf 

THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



could be inserted. But the catch was 
in an awkward position, and the 
slides were old and sticky. It wasn’t 
until Claudia came and got a firm 
grip on the far end that Phyllis was 
able to pull her end out enough to 
open up the space in the middle. 

“See,” said Pop. “There’re just 
some things that take more’n one to 
do.” He pulled an old envoi ope out 
of his pocket and began to sketch 
with the stub of a pencil. “Looky 
here, boys. We gotta build us some- 
thing like this and drop it down over 
them cannisters.” 

A nd by evening we were finished. 

Pop had welded up a kind of 
bottomless cage, a shallow affair 
made out of reinforcing rod and 
channel iron. It was just wide enough 
and long enough to fit down over 

153 





the cannisters stacked two high and 
ten long. In the center of the top 
of the cage was welded a cast iron 
collar, part of the clutch housing 
from an ’83 Ford, through which 
Pop had bored four radial holes. Out 
in the strip, half a mile from the 
house, Buzzy and I sank the mas- 
sive piston from an old pneumatic 
lift into the ground and anchored it 
upright with a couple of yards of 
concrete. 

Along the top of Pop’s cage ran 
four spring-loaded rods designed to 
extend inward from each corner, 
through the holes in the collar, and 
into matching holes bored in the 
pneumatic piston and lined with in- 
sulating ceramic. Once lowered over 
the piston with the rods seated 
through the collar into the piston, 
there would be only one way to re- 
move the cage and get at the cannis- 
ters underneath: someone had to be 
at each corner to pull back the rod. 
Four comers meant four Whees- 
kricks. At least that’s the way Pop 
had it figured. 

But it didn’t quite work out that 
way. 

It was nearly dark when we had 
finished. Pop had run the old M-70 
out to where we had planted the pis- 
ton, the cage dangling from the M- 
70’s A-frame. We stashed a thousand 
KVA MHD generator in a little patch 
of brush a hundred yards away and 
ran a heavy cable out from it to 
the cage. One lead Pop bolted to the 
cage; the other we tack-welded to 
the piston for a ground. The earth 
was moist from recent rains, and if 
the Wheeskricks were even halfway 
decent conductors, they should get a 



good jolt. At least that’s the way 
we figured it. 

Pop looked everything over and 
nodded with satisfaction. All that 
was left to us was to run the pick- 
up full of cannisters out, unload 
them under the dangling cage, and 
lower it into place. Judging from 
the time it had taken the Whees- 
kricks to detect us when we had 
driven from Jacobs* yard two nights 
before, we would have a good quar- 
ter hour before we could expect 
them, after we once moved the can- 
nisters. 

Buzzy was all for going ahead with 
it immediately. But Pop wanted to 
give the concrete a little more set- 
ting time, and I reminded Buzzy 
about the Wheeskricks vision. “We’re 
going to need every break we can 
get,” I said. I was feeling pessimistic 
and more than a little scared. I 
wished we could persuade Phyllis 
and Claudia to take the kids and 
leave. 

We slept fitfully that night, and at 
five in the morning Pop was up and 
dealing out weapons from his store 
in the basement. I took one of the 
75-shot carbines and looked longing- 
ly at the 55 mm bazooka. But I re- 
membered the hard, pitted surface 
of that ship and gave it up. Pop 
probably would have objected any- 
way. 

As if we’d been practising it for 
weeks, we drove the pickup out to 
the cage and offdoaded the twenty 
cannisters in a matter of minutes. In 
my mind’s eye I could see those 
Wheeskricks huddled in front of their 
detection screen whistling and chat- 
tering as the blips began to appear. 



154 



IF 




Pop pulled the M-70 into position 
and lowered the cage down over the 
piston. The four rods sprang home 
with a solid snap. Buzzy cast off the 
winch line, and Pop took off in the 
M-70 for the brush patch with the 
generator. 

Buzzy and I went to ground in a 
drainage ditch fifty yards away in 
tfie opposite direction and began to 
survey the sky in the direction of 
Morgantown. 

I t was just a little after sunup and 
a fine day. There were chicken- 
hawks wheeling in slow, precise cir- 
cles over the woodlot down by the 
stream. Cicadas were beginning to 
saw away in the heavy dew, and 
from somewhere way off to the north 
there came the faint, casual clank 
of cowbells as some farmer turned 
his herd into pasture. The faint 
whine of the MHD generator was the 
only other man-made sound. 

Then right on time the Whees- 
krick showed up. Their ship was low, 
not more than a couple of hundred 
feet off the ground, and it zigzagged 
slightly, like a hound coursing after 
scent. Then it locked on, flew swift- 
ly to the strip and settled silently a 
few yards from the stacked cannis- 
ters. There was an eerie silence, and 
then the turret winked into life, and 
the M-70 glowed cherry red and be- 
gan to burn. Its fuel tank went off 
with a shuddering blast, and the A- 
frame crumbled into ruin. The tur- 
ret winked off. Buzzy and I dug our 
noses deeper into the grassy bank 
of the drainage ditch. I hoped Pop 
had had sense enough to dig in in 
his brush patch. 



The round hatchway in the side 
of the Wheeskrick ship swung open, 
and two came out, their goldfish 
bowls shining in the morning sun. 
They looked around carefully, saw 
no sign of life, and stepped down to 
examine Pop’s handiwork. They 
heaved at the cage and jiggled it 
and then spotted the spring-loaded 
bolts. One of them loped around to 
the far side, pulled back one bolt 
and stretched to reach the other on 
his side. His waving tentacles were 
inches short. 

He rejoined his fellow and waved 
three tentacled arms in a curious 
pattern. We could hear his whistling 
and screeching through the goldfish 
bowl and fifty yards away. There 
were two formidable Wheeskrick 
shrugs, and one of them did some- 
thing to the top of his goldfish bowl 
and pointed a waving bunch of ten- 
tacles at the ship. The hatch closed 
and a moment later reopened. Two 
more Wheeskricks joined the first 
two and watched attentively as the 
first two gesticulated and wiggled 
their tentacles. 

As the four took up their stations 
at the corners of Pop’s cage, Buzzy 
dug me in the ribs. “We got ’em, 
Perce! We got ’em!” 

I heard the faint whine of the 
generator deepen into a growl as 
Pop threw the breakers in. 

The Wheeskricks went on about 
their business. They released the bolts 
and started to lift the cage up and 
off the piston. There was a flash of 
fire as the collar of the cage brush- 
ed against the piston. I heard the 
clatter of breakers going out and 
then being shoved back in manually. 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



155 




The cable leading to Pop’s brush pile 
glowed red and broke into smoking 
flame. Whatever else they were, the 
Wheeskricks were dandy dielectrics, 
and if they felt anything at all from 
the jolt Pop was giving them, they 
didn’t show it. 

But the glowing cable showed 
them something. They pitched the 
cage to one side and opened fire at 
Pop’s brush patch. I got the carbine 
in position and started plugging 
away; Buzzy blasted with his lazgun. 
I took my time and aimed for fish- 
bowls. I shot two, and two Whees- 
kricks lay rolling and gasping on the 
ground. Buzzy’s lazgun hung on a 
third until he went screeching and 
whistling toward the rear of the ship, 
stumbled, and fell rolling, his fish- 
bowl and tank bouncing away from 
his grasp. 

The grass in front of us flared, 
and Buzzy cursed. His hair was burn- 
ing, and he dropped the lazgun to 
beat out the flame. The remaining 
Wheeskrick made a dash for the 
open hatch, and without really 
thinking I was on my feet and run- 
ning through the burning pasture- 
land to intercept him. 

Wheeskricks are faster than peo- 
ple, and he beat me by a good ten 
yards. I snapped a few rounds from 
the hip as I ran and saw him spurt 
rusty fluid and drop pulpy tentacles, 
still writhing, on the ground. Then 
I was at the hatchway, thrusting the 
carbfne barrel into the rapidly dim- 
inishing gap between hatch and jamb. 
The barrel glowed red, and the stock 
began to smoulder; but it was good 
steel, and the Wheeskrick abandon- 
ed his attempt to burn it out of the 



doorway. I heard the inner lock open 
and choked at the rush of chlorine. I 
took a deep breath, pried with all my 
might on the ruined carbine and 
plunged into the red dimness with- 
in. 

The Wheeskrick lay just inside 
the inner door, viscous fluid pouring 
from one ruined shoulder. His five 
remaining arms scrabbled at the lock 
on the door, trying to shut it. Blind- 
ed by the chlorine, I flailed at the 
figure before me. Something hard 
smashed me in the face, and I felt 
teeth loosen. I jabbed with the car- 
bine, caught a glimpse of yellow and 
jabbed again. Something pulled my 
feet out from under me, and I fell 
heavily, swinging as I went. There 
was a crunch of plastic, and then 
fire flared in my face, and I saw the 
fire envelop the Wheeskrick and my 
own clothes start to burn. As I start- 
ed to take a deep breath, I felt 
hands — not tentacles — dragging 
me back toward daylight. 

XI 

C laudia was giving me mouth-to- 
mouth resuscitation, when I 
came to a quarter of an hour later. 
I kept my eyes tightly closed and 
enjoyed the treatment. But she 
must have been able to tell from 
my more regular breathing that I 
was on the mend, and she stopped. 

I opened my eyes, looked up at her 
tearstained face and the blue sky and 
the chickenhawks beyond. 

“Oh Perce!”, she said. I smiled 
and winked one bloodshot eye. 

We went back to the resuscitation 
treatment.

After a bit, I thought about Pop 
and sat up. Three Wheeskricks lay 
where they had fallen around the 
cannisters and at the rear of the 
ship; the fourth was hanging dead, 
half out of the hatchway. Pop was 
cursing in a steady monotone as Phyl- 
lis rubbed some kind of salve onto his 
burned neck and shoulder. Buzzy 
was holding a handkerchief over ihis 
nose and peering in over the dead 
Wheeskrick at the interior of the 
ship. I got to my feet and hobbled 
over to them. 

Buzzy looked around as I ap- 
proached. Most of his hair was miss- 
ing, and the bandages on his burned 
back were singed black. “You okay, 
Perce?” 

I felt for the burned places on my 
cheek and forehead. “Yeah, but I’m 
glad I had my campaign pictures 
taken before this started.” 

Buzzy turned back to his inspec- 
tion of the ship. “It’s going to be a 
while before we can get in there to 
look around.” 

“I’m in no hurry,” I said. “I been 
in there too much already. All I 
want to know is how much dough we 
can get for it.” Buzzy, who at the 
moment was full of the purest scien- 
tific curiosity, looked blankly at me. 
“Oh yeah. Your campaign.” 

We walked to the cannister pile, 
but Pop was already ahead of ns. 
He had horsed one of them free 
from the pile and was examining 
the sealing band. “Here, Buzzy. Take 
a look. I’ll be dipped if I can figure 
out how this thing opens.” 

Buzzy bent over the strip to in- 
spect it and then pulled a pair of 
pliers from his coverall pocket. He 



got a good grip and pulled. His face 
grew red and his knuckles white. The 
end of the strip didn’t budge. He 
stopped and wiped his hands on his 
coveralls. “Maybe this isn’t a sealing 
strip.” he said. “Maybe there’s some- 
thing else.” 

Together the three of us rolled the 
cannister over and over, examining 
every inch for some means of open- 
ing it. “No wonder old man Jacobs 
sold you these things so cheap 
Perce,” said Pop. “He couldn’t fig- 
ure out how to open the cotton-pick- 
ers.” 

I thought back to Jacobs’ yard. 
“He must have opened one,” I said, 
“or found one already opened. There 
was the one he’d put the MHD in.” 

“Say,” I said, “that one wasn’t 
open along the end at all, come to 
think of it. It was split right down 
the middle.” 

Pop got down on his hands and 
knees and took his glasses off. With- 
out his glasses, Pop has about four 
power magnification in his near- 
sighted eyes. 

He found the hair-fine crack that 
ran the length of the cannister, and 
mid-way along it he found a slight 
indentation. “Looky here, boys,” he 
said, laying his thumb in the inden- 
tation. 

T here was a soft, chiming sound 
and the quiet hum of delicate 
machinery. Pop sprang back in sur- 
prise, and the cannister slowly split 
open along its seam, the two halves 
swinging slowly back from each 
other until they both lay horizontal. 

From where I was standing I 
could see only one half; it was 



THE JUNK MAN COMETH 



157 




packed with a fantastically complex 
mechanism, like three running yards 
of swiss watch, digital computor and 
heart-lung machine all carefully fit- 
ted together. All that had been cov- 
ered by olive-drab Army packing 
paper at Jacobs, but I marveled at 
Jacobs selling the cannisters off as 
he did. He must have known the 
Wheeskricks would be coming after 
the cannisters and unloaded them in 
sheer panic. 

I looked at that cannister and saw 
dollar signs and campaign posters 
and 3-D time. I looked up at Pop, 
across the cannister, and saw shock. 
I moved toward him and looked 
back at the cannister. 

A man lay in the other half. An 
old fellow, maybe sixty or so. His 
•eyes were open, and he was grinning 
at us. He was naked as a jay bird. 

He sat up, did something to the 
maze of instruments in the cannis- 
ter’s other half and climbed to his 
feet, stepping gingerly out onto the 
grass. He looked about him, taking 
in the ship, the dead Wheeskricks 
and the five of us. Then he bowed to 
Pop, crooked his elbow and swung 
it in a short circle in some sort of 
ceremonial gesture and said some- 
thing like “Sally Constantinople.” 
Pop, who has dealt with a lot of odd 
ones in his life, didn’t blink an eye. 
He crooked his elbow and waggled 
it in the same sort of stiff gesture 
and answered: “Sally Constantin- 

ople, to you, buster.” 

The naked old man laughed, a 
nice human laugh, and walked with 
a quick and springing step to the 
hatch of the ship. The chlorine had 
pretty well dissipated now, and we 



all crowded in after him. He looked 
at the jury-rigged sleeping rack of 
the Wheeskricks with a frown of 
disapproval and then strode to the 
complicated control area, seated 
himself in one of those very human- 
looking chairs and began to examine 
various instruments with practised 
sureness, occasionally snapping a 
switch or turning a dial, nodding 
with satisfaction at the results he 
read off. 

He rose then, and we? followed 
him back outside to the pile of can- 
nisters. He carefully picked over 
them until he found what he was 
looking for and began to heave one 
clear from the others. He was an old 
man, and Buzzy and I leaped to help 
him. In the same way, he found two 
more, and we helped him line up 
all three on the grass. 

He thumbed all three open. Out 
of two stepped men, one middle- 
aged and one who looked about as 
old as Buzzy. From the third came a 
girl. 

Funny thing about women. Neith- 
er Claudia nor Phyllis had said a 
word during all this, exhibited no 
surprise at the masculine nudity, but 
when that girl rose, displaying firm 
breasts and smooth shanks to the 
West Virginia sun, both women 
started off for the house. “I’ll bet 
they’re hungry,” said Phyllis, eye- 
ing Buzzy with a speculative look. 
“Yes,” said Claudia. “And cold, too. 
We’d better get that poor girl some- 
thing to cover up with.” It was at 
least eighty by that time in the morn- 
ing! 

Well, that was the end of the 
business. We helped the three men 



158 



IF 




and the girl carry the cannisters into 
the ship and stow them in the after 
cargo compartment with the other 
200. We helped (them tear out the 
Wheeskricks’ make-shift sleeping 
racks, and we brought up a couple of 
milk cans full of spring water to top 
off their tanks. They ate the sand- 
wiches Phyllis and Claudia brought, 
but declined the offer of clothing 
with polite smiles. 

T hen we had a session with a 
pencil and one of my yellow 
legal pads, and they drew pictures 
much as the Wheeskricks had done, 
explaining how they had been under- 
way for a long time, maybe even 
hundreds of years — the time symbol 
was confusing. As passengers on the 
ship, they had no way of knowing 
just how it had happened, but the 
evidence they now had suggested 
that the Wheeskricks had somehow 
taken over the ship at some way-sta- 
tion, killed the regular crew (Jacobs’ 
empty cannister?) and stolen the 
ship and its encapsulated passengers. 
I couldn’t understand why the 
Wheeskricks wanted the passengers 
so much, and the pictures that ap- 
peared when I tried to ask didn’t 
help much.. 

But that was the end of the busi- 
ness anyway. By noon, all four had 
waggled their elbows at us and said 
“Sally Constantinople” to us several 
times and had smiled great appre- 
ciative smiles as they presented Pop 
with a small ceramic vase — a real 
work of art, I’m sure — and entered 
their ship, which now, with new in- 
habitants, didn’t look nearly so for- 



midable and frightening as it had 
before. 

There was a shimmer of air under 
the ship, a faint whine and then a 
rapidly diminishing dot in the sky. 
The chickenhawks stopped their 
circling for a moment to watch and 
then went back to work. The spot 
disappeared, and I stopped craning 
my neck and lowered my gaze to 
more mundane things. 

Claudia and Phyllis were gathering 
up paper plates and empty beer cans 
and shooing the children back to- 
ward the house, just as if they’d fin- 
ished a perfectly ordinary picnic in 
the State Park over at Olney. Pop 
was bent over a spade, excavating a 
grave for one of the Wheeskricks. 
Buzzy slumped over toward us, the 
doleful look on his face matching 
mine. 

P op finished his work and pried 
the dead Wheeskrick into its 
shallow grave. He looked at me, and 
then he looked a Buzzy. “What’s the 
matter boys? You both look so 
down in the mouth you’d think you 
been eatin’ baby ducks.” Pop cack- 
led at his own wit, but neither of us 
cracked a smile. 

Buzzy shook his head in sorrow. 
“I don’t know, Pop. Just disappoint- 
ed I guess. When I think what we 
could have learned from that ship, 
from anything in that ship! If thev’d 
just have given us anything but that 
damn vase.” 

Pop said: “The trouble with you, 
Buzzy, is you just ain’t no art lover.” 
He had something up his sleeve, but 
I was too depressed to notice it. He

159 




looked at me. “And what about you, 
Perce. What’s got you so unhappy?” 

I shook my head. “I guess I’m just 
disappointed too, Pop. I should be 
thankful that we all got out of this 
business more or less healthy, but 
I guess I was kind of counting on 
getting something out of it, some- 
thing we could raise a fast buck on.” 
I felt ashamed of myself. My mo- 
tives weren’t anywhere near as hon- 
orable as Buzzy’s pure love of 
science. 

“I guess I wanted that Senate seat 
pretty badly,” I said. “And all we’ve 
gotten is four dead Wheeskricks to 
bury.” 

Pop leaned on his spade and gave 
us that “how-did-a-smart-old-man- 
like-me-get-such-stupid-sons” look. 
He stripped the lid off a fresh can of 
beer and downed half of it at a gulp. 
Then he strode toward the brush 

^iiiiiimmiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMiiiiiiMiiiiiiiiiiii 



patch, beckoning Buzzy and me to 
follow. He pulled back the limbs of 
a scrub cotton-wood and there in the 
weeds lay four cannisters. 

Buzzy said: “Jeez, Pop. How’d 
you manage that?” 

“I snuck ’em back off the ship 
while they was eatin’ Phyllis’ sand- 
wiches and drawin’ pictures for you' 
boys.” 

I felt sick inside. “Pop” I said. 
“Don’t you know that (there are four 
human beings in there! You can’t do 
this!” 

Pop took a long pull on his beer 
and heaved the empty can off into 
orbit somewhere up near the chick- 
enhawks. 

“Aw heck, Perce. What do you 
think I am?” 

“I’m a junk dealer, Perce.” 

“These here are the empties.”

Dear Editor: 

When I first saw the table of 
contents in the April 1966 issue 
of If I almost fainted. Our Man 
in Fandom, my father's mustache, 
shades of Sergeant Saturn! What 
is Kiwi Carter trying to pull? But 
just the same I leafed to page 75. 

I was determined to bear it out; 
when I finished page 79 I had 
changed my whole opinion. Yea, 
Kiwi Carter, good show and all 
that. Let’s have longer articles in 
this series, I’m for them. By the 
way please pass the xeno. 

Oh, I read the rest of the issue 
too. It was of course great, won- 
derful, even good. The Laumer/- 
Brown serial looks promising. But I 
must congrat you on your first; it 
was one of the best I have seen. 
Let’s have more of Kiwi Brown; 
he is good. Do you know a good 
fanzine or' a good SF or fantasy 
club looking for readers or mem- 
bers? — William Costella, 23 Proctor

Dear Editor: 

This is one of my very infrequent 
letters to editors, and if you think 
it is going to be another of those If - 
is-a-wonderful-magazine letters in 



Hue & Cry, then you are wrong. It 
won’t. Still, you will find enclosed 
a bank check for a renewal of my 
subscription. I have tried to figure 
out why I want to subscribe to a 
magazine I don’t like, and I think I 
have found the answer. If is the 
most exasperating magazine I read. 
Every issue gives me 166 pages to 
complain about, and as I am an all 
too kind, sweet and forgiving char- 
acter, I have to brush up on my 
deficient nastiness to be able to 
survive. 

Take Robert A. Heinlein. You 
print three of the novels of the best 
all-round science-fiction writer to 
date — and they have to be three 
of his worst. Podkayne of Mars 
jumped from culture to culture and 
dissolved into good sf’s worst enemy, 
the Big Chase. Famham f s Freehold 
was talkative, long-drawn and dis- 
organized. I had high hopes for The 
Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, but it 
turned into another discussion pro- 
tocol. Oh, the details are wonder- 
ful, as always with Heinlein, but 
the presentation is a flop. Only 
very few novels survive a first per- 
son singular treatment, but ever 
since Robert Graves’s I, Claudius 
authors seem unable to resist it.

Graves's story could not be told 
in any other way, because the story 
was the man who was supposed to 
tell it and who, because of his posi- 
tion, could have no other way to 
tell it than in an autobiography. But 
the revolt of a lunar colony is not 
a story which could be told from 
only one single viewpoint. And 
therefore the autobiography's all in- 
herent faults show glaringly, made 
infinitely worse by Heinlein's choice 
of narrator. Professor de la Paz 
would have written an autobiogra- 
phy to set the record straight for 
future historians, and he would 
have enjoyed writing it. Stu LaJoie 
would have written for the fun of 
it. Wyoh would have written to give 
the others the honor due them . 
and every one of them would have 
written an even more enjoyable 
story than Manny's because they 
all would have placed more em- 
phasis on people for the reason 
than they all understand and work 
people better than Manny does. A 
lesser author would have had Man- 
ny write the kind of story Stu 
LaJoie would have written, but 
Heinlein is that rare than, an auth- 
or with consistency, and having 
made the worst possible choice he 
sticks to it . Even a Heinlein flop 
is better than 99% of most sf, and 
the novel was certainly the best 
thing printed in If for years — but 
as usual with If it came out worse 
than necessary. 

Start doing something about lf\ 
Discontinue World of Tomorrow , 
which is even worse, if you cannot 



get time otherwise, and make If 
grow in something else but word- 
age. Science fiction should not have 
to become as stereotyped as the 
Western. It should not be predict- 
able. If you cannot do something 
better out of If, then by all means 
leave editing to someone who can 
and use your time writing. You are 
too good a writer to waste your time 
being an indifferent editor. 

My best wishes, anyway! — Sten 
Dahlskog, Tuna Backar 17 A, Upp- 
sala 16, Sweden. 

# Funny thing about Heinlein. In 
his incompetence to make the right 
basic decisions about how to write a 
story, he nevertheless manages to 
make his characters come so much 
to life that every reader knows at 
once what he should have done to 
make the story better . and no 
two readers agree! 

There was a lot more to that let- 
ter, by the way, but we only had 
room for about 20% of it (unless 
we bring out another magazine 
called Famous Fan Letters ) ; we 
appreciate your letters, friends, but 
we'd appreciate them even more if 
they were short enough to print 
entire. 

That about does it for this month. 
Our “first" is H. B. Michel this is- 
sue. Next issue we start a two- 
parter by A. Bertram Chandler in 
which he blends two themes he's 
touched on before — the Rim 
Worlds, and those wonderful mutat- 
ed rats from Giant Killer . After 
that . well, stick around and see!
