“We’re looking for people 
who want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School. Former 

editor. Reader’s Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 



publications including Reader's Digest, 
True, Redbook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
“I just received a check from Ellery 
Queen's Mystery Magazine. That’s 11 
stories rold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman's Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.

RAPID TRANSIT 



B y the time we are all a decade 
older, if the aircraft manufac- 
turers have anything to say about 
it, we will be able to travel from 
point to point in a supersonic jet. 
We We all seen drawings and mock- 
ups of the SST, of course. Droop- 
snoot, swept wing, titanium hull and 
all, it is planned to cruise at 1800 
miles an hour and get us from Lon- 
don to New York in about a hundred 
and fifty minutes. 

Lovely idea. , . 

H appens that the other day we 
made that trip. (We were com- 
ing back from the Trieste Science- 
Fiction Film Festival, and if youVe 
any interest in what went on there 
you can find out all about it in the 
first issue of our new magazine. 
International Science Fiction,) It 
might be instructive to look at the 
log of this particular odyssey: 

11:30 AM, London time. Depart 
hotel in London to arrive at Heath- 
row Airport one hour before sched- 
uled take off at 1:00 PM. (Required 
by all airlines on international 
flights — heaven knows why.) 

Noon, London time. Arrive Heath- 
row, discover flight will be two and 
a half hours late because of ‘‘late 
arrival of aircraft.’’ (You know how 
insistent the airlines are about re- 
quiring a telephone contact number 
from their passengers? Anybody 
ever find out why they never use 
them?) 

3:30 PM, London time. Takeoff 
from Heathrow. Nonstop flight ex- 
pected to take 7 hours 40 minutes; 
allowing for 5-hour time difference. 



should teuch down at Kennedy Air- 
port in New York at 6:10 local New 
York time. 

7:30 PM, New York time. Arrive 
over Kennedy Airport, late because 
of (a) headwinds, (b) pilot dawd- 
ling because his radio advisories 
have told him Kennedy is stacked 
up due to weather and heavy traffic. 
We go into the stack. 

7:50 PM, New York time. Delay 
until landing estimated at one and 
one-half hours. As we have only that 
much fuel in the tanks and the pilot 
doesn’t like the idea of landing with 
dry tanks, we divert to Boston. 

8:00-9:00 PM, New York time. 
We sit on the field in Boston, while 
fuel arrives and is pumped in. Be- 
cause of quarantine, customs and 
immigration restrictions, nobody 
leaves the aircraft. (The air-condi- 
tioning does not work while the 
plane is on the ground at this air- 
port. It is late July.) 

9:30 PM, New York time. Back 
in the Kennedy stack. 

10:00 PM, New York time. Land. 
Wait for assignment of unloading 
area. 

10:30 PM. Debark. Look for miss- 
ing baggage. File lost-baggage re- 
port. Pass through customs (28 in- 
spectors “on duty”, four physically 
present and working.) Attempt to 
secure taxi. 

2:35 AM, New York time. Arrive 
at destination, 46 miles from Ken- 
nedy Airport. 

Adding up the totals, we have: 

Downtown London to takeoff line 
at Heathrow, approximately 30 
miles, elapsed time 4 hours.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accoinplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man*s mind, and the 
mastery of lifers problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

Airborne at Heathrow to airborne 
over Kennedy, approximately 3500 
miles, elapsed time 9 hours. 

Airborne over Kennedy to destin- 
ation in New Jersey, approximately 
46 miles, elapsed time 7 hours 5 
minutes. (This route, by the way, is 
served by an air taxi, actual flying 
time being approximately 20 min- 
utes. However, the air taxi stops 
running at 10:00 PM.) 

— You understand that we don’t 
mean to say that there is anything 
very special or unprecedented about 
this sort of jet-age odyssey. That’s 
the trouble. It happens every day. 

N ow let’s substitute in the SST 
for the VC-10 we were actually 
using on this trip. The supersonic 
transport can cruise at 1800 miles 
an hour, which means it can do the 
trip in about 2 hours thirty minutes, 
allowing for time to get up to its 
operating altitude of 70,000 feet as 
it leaves England and get back down 
as it approaches the northeastern 
United States. 

But the VC-10 can cruise at near- 
ly 600 miles an hour and doesn’t 
need as much take-off and landing 
time. It could have done the trip 
in 6 hours, actually took nine from 
point to point; it’s only fair to as- 
sume that the SST won’t be operat- 
ing flat-out either. So increase the 
I)oint-to-point time from 150 minutes 
to 225 minutes for the SST. 

What about the rest of the trip? 
Ground-transport time? Certainly 
it will not be less simply because 
you’re boarding a titanium aircraft 
instead of an aluminum one. Pass- 
ing through customs? Certainly no 
less time; it is a fact of life that 
the heavier the traffic, the longer 
it takes to get through any sort of 
red tape, and the SST proponents 
estimate it will double traffic. 



Stacking time? Ah, there’s where it 
really hurts. The SST burns up fuel 
at a fantastic rate. It simply cannot 
stay stacked very long — which 
means diversion for refueling, since 
there is no hope on God’s green 
earth that airport facilities will be 
better able to cope with the demands 
of their traffic ten years from now 
than they are today. If anything, 
worse. Every major city needs ad- 
ditional air facilities right now. Not 
one has adequate expansion even 
planned. 

And, of course, a diverted SST is 
an abomination; it wastes all that 
precious fuel and flight-time. 

So there you have it. On the most 
charitable assumptions, the SST 
would cut this sort of twenty-hour 
trans-Atlantic crossing to maybe 
fifteen hours. In practice, you 
would most certainly lose back that 
five-hour saving on diversions and 
ground time. On any other route 
(over land, say, or across the Paci- 
fic), the SST would be either com- 
pelled to waste its speed because of 
catastrophic sonic boom (requiring 
it to operate at the same speed as 
the VC-10 over inhabited land 
areas) or would be inefficient for 
other reasons. 

The big difference, in short, be- 
tween SST travel and what you can 
get out of any airport in the world 
right now, is that for SST travel 
you would be paying approximately 
three times as much. 

W ell, we civilized peoples of the 
world are spending an awful 
lot of money awfully foolishily on 
an incredible variety of things. But 
on that idiot list, wouldn’t you say 
the $5 billion earmarked for the 
SST development programs stands 
very high indeed?

He was sent back in time — 
fo protect a famous heretic 
from destruction by a berserker! 



by FRED . 
SABERHAGEN 



Illustrated by 
GAUGHAN

■he barefoot man in the gray 
friar’s habit topped a rise and 
paused to survey the country ahead. 
In that direction the paved road he 
was traveling continued to run almost 
straight under a leaden sky, hump- 
ing over one scrubbily wooded hill 
after another. The stones of this 
road had been laid down in the 
days of expansion of the great Em- 
pire, and there was not much else 
in the world that had survived the 
centuries between then and now. 



The friar was of medium height 
and rather thin. His appearance 
seemed to have little to do with 
age; he was somewthere between 
twenty and forty. His scantily 
bearded face expressed his tired- 
ness, and his gray robe was spotted 
with grayer mud. The fields up to 
the shoulders ^of the road were all 
ankle-deep in mud, and most of 
them showed no sign of having 
been plowed or planted this spring 
or last. The only sign of recent hu- 
man presence visible from where the 
friar stood now was a heap of low 





7 




ruined walls at roadside just ahead. 
Only the ruin was recent; the walls 
themselves had been old and might 
have been a caravanserai or legion 
post in the days of the Empire’s 
strength. But last month or last ten- 
day, new war had passed this way, 
dissolving one more building into 
raw tumbled stones. Before grass 
could start to grow on the stones, 
it seemed likely that they might sink 
into the mud without a trace. 

When he reached the remnant of 
a wall, the friar sat down on it, 
resting from his long journey and 
looking with minor sadness at the 
minor destruction about him. He 
leaned Over and picked up one fallen 
stene; his wiry hands showed 
stren^gth. With something like a prac- 
ticed mason’s look in his eye, he 
fitted the stone into a notch in the 
stump of wall and studied the effect. 

A distant hail made him raise his 
head and look back along the way 
he had come. Another lone figure, 
dressed in' a habit much like his 
own, was hastening toward him, 
waving both arms for attention. 

The first friar forgot his little 
game with the stone, returned the 
wave and waited. 

T he approaching figure soon re- 
solved itself into a man of 
middle height, clean shaven and al- 
most stout. “Glory to the Holy One, 
reverend brother!” puffed this new- 
comer, arriving at last within easy 
talking distance. 

The bearded friar had gotten to 
his feet, and now his thin face light- 
ed gently. “Glory to His name.” 
The jportly one asked anxiously: 



“Are you, as I think. Brother Jovann 
of Ernard?” 

“That is my name.” 

“Now may the Holy One be 
praised!” The heavier man made a 
wedge-sign with his hands and roll- 
ed eyes heavenward. “My name is 
Saile, brother. Now may the Holy 
One be praised, say I — ” 

“So be it.” 

“ — for He has led me in mysteri- 
ous ways to reach your side! Brother 
Jovann, others will be flocking to 
your side, for the fame of your hero- 
ic virtue has spread afar in many 
lands. Even in the isolated villages 
of these remote hills, the peasants 
are aware now of your passage.” 

“I fear my many faults are 
known hereabouts, for I was born 
not far away.” 

“Ah, brother, you are overly 
modest. From numerous people in 
this land, as well as elsewhere, I 
have heard again and again of your 
ejxploits. How, two months ago, you 
dared to leave the encampment of 
the army of the Faithful, to cross 
no-man’s-land boldly into the very 
ranks of the Infidel, there to enter 
the tent of the Arch-Infidel him- 
self and preach to him the truth of 
our Holy Mother Temple!” 

“And to fail to convert him.” 
Jovann nodded sadly. “You do well 
to remind me of my failure, for I 
am prone to the sin of pride.” 

“Ah.” Saile lost headway. But it 
was only for a moment. “My own 
most humble wish. Brother Jovann, 
is that I be allowed to be among 
the very first to join your order. Ah, 
you are even now on your way to 
Empire City? To petition our Vicar,

IF 




the most holy Nabur ithe Eighth, for 
permission to found a new order 
of your own?” 

“Truly, God has called me to such 
a task. Brother Saile.” The thin 
friar’s eyes looked into the distance. 
“Once I labored at rebuilding tem- 
ples with stones and bricks, but now 
I am called to rebuild with men.” 
His attention came back, smiling. 
“As for your becoming a member 
of the new order when it is formed, 
I can say nothing yet. But if you 
should choose to walk with me to 
Empire City, I will be happy for 
your company.” 

“I am most highly honored. 
Brother Jovann!” 

S aile prolonged his thanks to 
some length as they walked on 
together. He had also commented 
extensively on the chances of yet 
more rain falling and was discours- 
ing on the question of where they 
might hope to obtain their next meal, 
when there came a distraction. 

A speedy coach that looked as if 
it might belong to some middle-rank- 
ing noble or prelate was overtaking 
them on the road. The friars’s ears 
gave them plenty of warning to 
step aside; four agile loadbeasts 
were making the wheels datter over 
the leveled stones at a good speed. 

As the coach sped past. Brother 
Jovann found his eyes drawn to the 
face of one occupant who rode fac- 
ing forward, head and one arm ex- 
tended slightly out a window. This 
was an old man, stocky of build — 
so far as could be judged — gray- 
bearded, but with the short-cut hair 



on his head still ginger colored. His 
thick mouth was twisted slightly as 
if ready to spit or to dispute. 

“I had hoped they might give us a 
lift,” Brother Saile muttered un- 
happily, watching the coach dwindle 
along the road ahead. “All the seats 
were not occupied, were they?” 
Brother Jovann shook his head; 
he had not noticed how many were 
in the coach. His attention had been 
drawn and held by the old man’s 
eyes. Fixed ahead, in the direction o . 
the Holy City a hundred miles away, 
those eyes were clear and gray and 
powerful. And very much afraid.

W hen Derron Odegard walked 
out on the victory celebration 
in Time Operation, he found his 
feet taking him to Lisa, to face her 
with the news of Matt’s death and 
get it over with. 

She had only just moved out of 
the student nurses’s quarters at the 
hospital, to try some job and share 
a cubicle with another girl in a low- 
rank, uplevel corridor. Lisa’s room- 
mate, in the midst of doing some- 
thing to her hair, opened the door 
to Derron and then had to go back 
inside to pretend not to be listening. 

Lisa evidently saw Derron’s’ news 
in his face or guessed it. Her own 
face becoming calm as a mask, she 
stood just inside the half-open door, 
not asking him in from the corri- 
dor. 

He nodded. “It’s Matt — the bat- 
tle’s won, the berserkers are 
stopped. But he’s dead, he sacri- 
fice himself to do it.” 



BROTHER BERSERKER

She lifted her head proudly, show- 
ing no surprise. “Of course; what 
else could he do? That’s the job 
you gave him.” 

“Understand, Lisa, when I went to 
him with that salestalk I thought 
he was going to have a chance.” 
Her voice and her face began to 
break together. “I — knew you were 
going to kiU him.” 

“My God, Lisa! I didn’t mean 
to do that.” 

Breaking up and melting, she 
leaned against the doorjamb. “And 
now there’s n-nothing to be done.” 
“Hie doctors tried — but 
no, nothing. We can’t go after his 
lifelin© in the past ^gain — it’d 
wrelok the world to try to pull it out 
of inm now.” 

not worth it!” 
trying to console her 



with some stupidities when the door 
closed in his face. 

A few days later he was sitting 
alone in his tiny private office 
on the Operations level, slumping in 
his chair, thinking that if Lisa were 
the woman he needed he would liave 
stayed and kicked her door down; 
it was only a door, and behind it 
she was still alive. 

No, the woman he needed, whose 
image still ruled his secret thoughts, 
had been for a year and more be- 
hind the door of death; and no man 
had yet found a way of smashing 
through that. So in the matter of 
Lisa — as in everything else — 
Derron could no longer care very 
much. 

After he had sat in his sdent 
office for a while, he noticed an 



IF 




official-looking envelope, sealed and 
addressed to him, on the desk. After 
another while he took the envelope 
and opened it. 

Inside was the formal notice of 
his new promotion, to the rank of 
colonel. “ — in consideration of 
your recent outstanding service in 
Time Operations, and in the expec- 
tation that you will continue — ” 
A set of appropriate collar insignia 
were enclosed. 

He sat there a while longer, look- 
ing across the room at what rested 
like a trophy atop his little book- 
case — an ancient battle helmet, 
ornamented with wings. He was still 
doing this when the clangor of the 
alert signal vibrated throughout 
Operations, pulling him reflexively 
to his feet. In another moment he 
was on the way to the briefing room. 



L atecomers were still hurrying in 
when a general officer, Time 
Ops’ chief of staff, mounted the dais 
to get things started. 

“The third berserker assault has 
begun, gentlemen. Win or lose, this 
will be the last. It’ll give us the 
final bearing we need to locate their 
staging area, twenty-plus thousand 
years down.” 

There was an optimistic murmur 
heard. 

“Don’t cheer yet. This third at- 
tack gives every indication of being 
a hard one to beat.” The general 
went through the unveiling of haste- 
ly assembled maps and models. 
“Like the previous attack, this one 
is aimed at a single man. And again 
there’s no doubt about the target’s 
identity — this time the name is 
Vincent Vincento.” 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



n 





There was a murmur at that name. 
There would have been a reaction 
from almost any audience that could 
have been assembled on Sirgol. Even 
the half-educated of the planet had 
heard of Vincento, though the man 
was some three hundred and fifty 
years dead and he had never ruled 
a nation or raised an army. 

Derron’s attention became con- 
centrated. In his pre-war historical 
studies he had specialized in Vin- 
cento’s time and place. And that 
locale was also oddly connected 
with his private grief. 

The briefing officer spoke on. 

“Vincento’s lifeline is among the 
very few we have been able to pro- 
tect by sentry action along their 
entire effective lengths. Of course, 
this doesn’t mean a berserker can’t 
get near him; but if one tries to kill 
Vincento or even attacks someone 
else within a couple of miles of 
him, we’ll be onto its keyhole in a 
couple of seconds, present-time, and 
cancel it out. The same if it should 
try to kidnap or capture Vincento 
-or take any direct physical action 
at all against him. The protection ex- 
tends along Vincento’s lifeline from 
before his birth until the completion 
of his last im{x>rtant work at the 
age of seventy-eight. We can assume 
the enemy knows about it and is 
planning something more subtle 
than direct physical assault.” 

The general went into the techni- 
cal evidence for this, then moved 
on to another point. “Chronological- 
ly, the enemy penetration is not 
more than a tenday before the start 
of Vincento’s famous trial before 
the Defenders of the Faith. There 



may well be a connection; suppose 
for example that a berserker could 
alter the outcome of the trial to get 
Vincento sentenced to death. It 
would be practically impossible for 
us to find a keyhole by tracing any- 
thing so indirect. 

“And an actual death sentence 
would not seem to be necessary for 
the enemy’s purpose. Vincento is 
seventy years old at the time of his 
trial. If it should result in his being 
put to torture or thrown into a dun- 
geon, his life would be effectively 
ended.” 

A nother general, seated in the front 
row, raised a hand. “Doesn’t 
some such treatment happen to him 
historically?” 

“No. Historically, Vincento never 
spends a day of his life in prison. 
After his recantation at the trial, 
he spends the remainder of his life 
in physically comfortable house ar- 
rest, where he has time to lay the 
foundation of the science of dynam- 
ics — and on that, of course, our 
science and our survival heavily de- 
pend.” 

The questioning general shifted 
once more in his front rank chair. 
“How in the world is an alien ma- 
chine going to influence the outcome 
of a trial?” 

The briefing officer stared gloom- 
ily at his charts. “Frankly we’ve 
still a shortage of good ideas on 
that. We doubt that it’ll try to play 
a supernatural role, since the last 
such attempt failed. 

“Here’s something to keep in 
mind. Only one enemy device is en- 
gaged in this attack, and from all in- 

IP 



12 




dications it’s physically small, only 
about the size of a man — which 
suggests the possibility ithat this one 
may be an android. Yes, I know, 
the berserkers have never, anywhere, 
been able to fabricate an android 
that would pass in human society 
as a normal person. Still, we hardly 
dare rule out the possibility that 
this time they’ve succeeded.” 

The discussion turned to counter- 
measures. A whole arsenal of de- 
vices were being kept in readiness 
for dropping into the past, but no 
one could say yet what might be 
needed. 

“The one really bright spot, of 
course, is that this attack’s within 
the time band where we can drop 
live agents, so we count on men 
on the spot as our main defense. 
People who’ll keep their eyes on 
Vincento from a little distance; peo- 
ple able to spot any significant devi- 
ation from history. They’ll need to 
know that particular period very 
well, besides having experience in 
Time Operations . .” 

Listening, Derron looked down 
at the new insignia he was still 
i^arrying in his hand. And then he 
3egan at last to pin them on. 

B rother Jovann and Brother Saile 
topped yet another hill, a few 
miles along from the spot where 
they had met, and found they were 
soon to catch up with the coach that 
had passed them so speedily. Its 
loadbeasts unharnessed and grazing, 
it stood empty beside the broken 
gate of a high-walled enclosure at 
the foot of the next hill ahead. 

On top of that hill there towered 



a great cathedral-temple, its stones 
too new for moss or weathering. 
Aloof against the lowering sky, it 
seemed to float above all human ef- 
fort and concern. 

The ancient road, after passing 
the broken-gated monastery at the 
foot of the hill, swerved to meet a 
bridge — or the stub of a bridge, 
rather, for all of the spans were 
gone, with most of the piers that had 
supported them. The river that had 
burst its bridge was raging, ravaging 
the lowlands on either side, obvious- 
ly swollen to several times its nor- 
mal flow. 

On the other side of the river, 
beyond another stub of bridge, the 
town of Oibbog sat on secure high 
ground. A person or two could be 
seen moving in those distant streets. 
Coaches and loadbeasts were waiting 
there, too, interrupted in their jour- 
neys that were outbound from the 
Holy City. 

Leaden clouds still mounted omi- 
nously up the sky. From them the 
river fled, lashed and goaded by 
distant flails of lightning, a great 
swollen, terrified snake that had 
burst its bonds and carried them 
away. 

“Brother River will not let us 
cross tonight.” 

When he heard this personifica- 
tion, Saile’s head turned cautiously 
sideways, as if he wondered whether 
he might be expected to laugh. But 
before he decided, the rain broke 
again, like a waterfall. Tucking up 
robes, both friars ran to join the 
occupants of the coach in whatever 
shelter the abandoned-looking mon- 
astery might afford.

Ill 

A hundred miles away, in the 
capital of the vanishing Empire 
and the Holy City of the embattled 
Temple, the same day was warm 
and sultry. Only the cold rage of 
Nabur the Eighth, eighty-first in the 
sLiccesssion of Vicars of the Holy 
One, stirred like a storm-wind the 
air of (|is private apartments. 

The rage had been some time ac- 
cumulating thought Defender Belam, 
who now stood waiting for it to be 
over. Accumulated and saved until 
now, when it could be discharged 
harmlessly, vented into the discreet 
ears of a trusted auditor. 

The Vicar paused, distracted in 
his peripatetic tirade against his 
military opponents by a look down 
into a courtyard where workmen 
were unloading massive blocks of 
marble from a train of carts and a 
sculptor waited to choose one block 
for Nabur’s |>ortrait-statue. What 
matter if his eighty predecessors had 
each been willing to let posterity 
decide such matters for them? 

The Vicar turned suddenly, the 
skirts of his simple white robe swirl- 
ing, and caught Belam wearing a 
disapproving face. 

In his angry tenor the Vicar 
snapped: “When the statue is fin- 
ished we will place it in the city’s 
Great Square, that the majesty of 
our person may be increased in the 
eyes of the people!” 

“Yes, my Vicar.” Belam, for 
decades a defender and prince of the 
Temple, had seen them come and 
go. He was not easily perturbed by 
Vicarial temper. 



“It is needful that we be shown 
increased respect. The infidels and 
heretics are tearing apart the world 
which has been given by God into 
our care!” The last sentence came 
bursting out, a cry from the inner 
heart. 

“I have faith, my Vicar, that our 
prayers and our armies will yet 
prevail.” 

“Prevail? Of course!” A sarcastic 
grimace. “Someday! Before the end 
of time! But now our Holy Temple 
lies bleeding and suffering, and we 
. we must bear many burdens. 
Many, Belam. You cannot began 
to realize, until you mount our 
throne.” 

Belam bowed in silent reverence. 

The Vicar paced again, skirts flap- 
ping. This time he had a goal. From 
his high-piled worktable his shaking 
fist snatched up a pamphlet already 
worn from handling — and perhaps 
from angry crumpling as well. A 
contributing and perhaps sufficient 
cause of today’s anger, computed 
Belam’s cool theologian’s brain, 
knowing what the pamphlet was. A 
small thorn, compared with others. 
But this one had stabbed Nabur in 
the tenderest part of his vanity. 

N abur turned round and shook 
the paper-covered pamphlet at 
him. “Because you have been away, 
Belam, we have not yet had the 
chance to discuss this with you. This 
back-stabbing abomination of Mes- 
sire Vincento’s! This so-called Dia~ 
logue on the Movement of the 
Tides! In this he continues to 
promulgate his heresy-tainted dreams 
of reducing the solid world beneath 



14 



IF 




our feet to a mere speck which 
flies around the sun. Suit tihait is not 
enough. No, not for him! No!” 
Belam frowned now in puzzle- 
ment. “What else, my Vicar?” 
Nabur advanced on him in a glow 
of anger. “The arguments of the 
pamphlet are cast in the form of a 
dialogue among three persons. And 
Vincento intends one of these fic- 
tional debaters — the one who de- 
fends traditional ideas, who there- 
fore is described as ‘simple minded’ 
and ‘'below the level of human intelM- 
gence’ — he intends this person to 
represent ourself!” 

“My Vicar!” 

“He even places some of my own 
words in the mouth of this simple- 
ton, so-caMed!” 

Belam shook his head douibtfully. 
“Vincento has never been modenaite 
in his disputes, which have been 
many. But I am not convinced that 
he has ever intended any irrever- 
ence to your person.” 

mi^e no doubt of it!” Vicar 
Nabur almost screamed. Then the 
most honored man in the world — 
possibly also the most hated, quite 
possibly also the most strained by 
what he saw as his appointed tasks 
— groaned incontinently and threw 
himself like a spoiled child into a 
chair. 

Arrogance remained, as always, 
but the spoiled-child aspect did not 
last long. Irascible humors having 
been discharged, calm and intelli- 
gence returned. “Belam.” 

“My Vicar?” 

“Have you had a chance to read 
this pamphlet? It has been widely 
calculated.” 



Belam gravely inclined his head. 

“Then give us your considered 
opinion.” 

“I am a theologian, my Vicar, 
and not an astronomer. But it seems 
to me that Vincento’s arguments in 
the pamphlet concerning the tides 
really prove nothing regarding the 
movement of the celestial bodies and 
are not even very accurate as re- 
gards the tides themselves — ” 

“He thinks we are fools, who 
will accept whatever argument he 
offers. And who will not realize it 
when he mocks us!” The Vicar 
stood up, then tiredly sat down 
again. 

Belam ignored for the moment 
the theory that Vincento had intend- 
ed personal mockery. “As the Vicar 
may possibly recall, I bad occasion 
some years ago to write to Vincen- 
to regarding these speculations on 
the idea of a sun-centered universe. 
Then as now such theorizing caused 
me concern in my capacity as a De- 
fender.” 

“We recall very well. Messire Vin- 
cento has already been summoned 
to stand trial for his violation in 
this pamphlet of your injunction. 
What exactly did you write him, 
again?” 

B elam spoke slowly and thought- 
fully. “First, that mathematici- 
ans are quite free to calculate and 
publish whatever they wish regard- 
ing the celestial appearances — pro- 
vided they remain strictly in the 
realm of hyopthesis. 

“Secondly, it is quite a different 
matter to say that in fact the sun 
is in the center of the universe — 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



15 




that in fact our globe spins from 
west to east each day while re- 
volving round the sun each year. 
Such statements must be considered 
very dangerous; though not precisely 
heretical, they are liable to injure 
faith by contradicting the Holy Writ- 
ings.” 

“Your memory, Belam, is even 
more than usually excellent. Just 
when did you write this letter of in- 
junction?” 

“Fifteen years ago, my Vicar.” 
Belam smiled briefly and dryly. 
“Though I must admit that I re- 
read our archive copy this morning, 
after perusing the — um — pamph- 
let in question. 

He became utterly serious again. 
“Thirdly and lastly, I wrote Vincento 
that if some real proof existed of 
the sun-centered universe he cham- 
pions, we should then be forced to 
revise our interpretation of those 
passages in the Holy Writings which 
would appear to be contradicted. We 
have in the past revised our think- 
ing, for example in regard to the 
roundness of the world. 

“But, in the absence of any real 
proof, traditional authority and 
opinion is not to be set aside.” 

NabuV was listening with great 
attentiveness. “It seems to us, Belam, 
that you wrote well, as usual.” 

“Thank you, my Vicar.” 

S atisfaction appeared mixed with 
anger in the Vicarial mien. 
“Certainly in this pamphlet Vincen- 
to has violated your injunction! The 
debater into whose mouth he puts 
his own opinions'^rgues that in very 
truth our globe spins like a toy top 



beneath our feet — until the very 
last page. Then our argument, that 
God may produce what effect he 
likes in the world, without being 
bound by scientific causes — our 
argument is quoted by the simple- 
ton, who has been wrong about 
everything else — quoted as coming 
from ‘a person of high learning and 
wisdom, supremely above contradic- 
tion’. And at this the other debat- 
ers piously declare themselves 
silenced. One cannot fail to see 
them, and their author, laughing up 
their sleeves!” 

Vicar Nabur paused to regain 
breath and calm. Then he went on. 
“Now, Belam. Other than this weary 
argument on tides, which I agree is 
inconclusive, can there exist any- 
where any evidence for Vincento’s 
spinning world? Anything he might 
impertinently produce at his trial, 
to . disrupt its course?” 

Belam frowned thoughtfully at 
the floor. “My Vicar, I have through 
the years made an effort to keep 
abreast of astronomers’s thinking. I 
fear many of them, religious and 
laymen both, have become Messire 
Vincento’s enemies, largely because 
of his arrogance in claiming for his 
own all that these new devices, tele- 
scopes, find in the heavens. An ar- 
rogant and argumentative man is 
hard to bear and triply so when he 
is so often in the right.” Belam 
glanced up for a moment, but Nabur 
had not taken the description as ap- 
plying to anyone but Vincento. 

The Defender of the Faith went 
on: “But still I believe that most 
astronomers now perform their cal- 
culations using the mathematical as- 



16 



IF 




sumption that the planets, or some 
ef them, revolve about the sun. Of 
course such an idea is not original 
with Vincente, nor is the idea that 
©ur globe is only a planet. It seems 
these ideas make the mathematics 
©f celestial movement somewhat 
more elegant and satisfying; fewer 
epicycles need be included in the 
•rbits to make them fit the circular 
form — ” 

“You say Vincento makes the 
mathematics more elegant. But can 
he have proofs mathematical or 
otherwise? Plain evidence of any 
kind?” 

“I would say rather the contrary.” 

“Ha!” 

Belam gestured with his scholar’s 
hands, frail fingers unsure of techni- 
calities, but till grasping firmly what 
they had to grasp. “It seems that 
if our globe did make a yearly jour- 
ney round the sun, the relative po- 
sitions of the stars should appear 
to us to change from month to 
month as we approached certain 
constellations or drew away from 
them. And no such displacement of 
stars can be observed.” 

“Ha!” 

“Of course it is possible to argue 
that the stars are simply too dis- 
tant for our measurements to show 
such displacement. My Vicar, I fear 
that no astronomer can prove Vin- 
cento wrong, though some would 
dearly love to do so. The celestial 
appearances would seem to be es- 
sentially the same, whether we go 
round the sun or it goes round us. 

“Now, as I wrote Vincento, where 
there is lack of centainty we have 
no excuse for turning our backs on 



tradition and on the plain meaning 
of the Holy Writings. We of the 
Temple have been entrusted by God 
with the duty to defend the 'truth. 
And, my Vicar, what I wrote Vin- 
cento fifteen years ago is still true 
today — I have never been shown 
any proof of the motion of the 
world we stand on. And so I cannot 
believe that any such proof or any 
such motion exists.” 

T he Vicar raised his hands, then 
clamped them down upon the 
arms of his ornate work-chair, 
though his face had gentled in regret. 
“Then it is our decision that you 
and the other Defenders must pro- 
ceed with the trial.” As Nabur spoke 
on, his anger gradually returned. 
“No doubt he can be convicted, of 
violating your injunction against 
teaching a doctrine liable to injure 
faith. But understand, we have no 
wish to visit any great punishment 
upon our erring son; in charity we 
grant that he intended no direct in- 
sult to our person. He is only head- 
strong and stubborn. And intemper- 
ate in debate! He must learn that 
he cannot set himself up as a super- 
ior authority on all matters, spiritual 
and tempK>ral . did he not once 
even attempt to lecture you on theo- 
logy?” 

Belam inclined his head and sharp- 
ly warned himself to guard against 
taking any personal satisfaction in 
Vincento’s coming humiliation. 

“Ah, I could curse the man! In 
the past, we have been the first to 
heap praise on his achievements. We 
have granted him hours of private 
audience; we have shown him friend-

liness in a degree we do <not al- 
ways grant to princes. Before our 
ascending to this dhiaJr, we even 
wrote a pamphlet in ihis praise! And 
now, how are we repaid?” 

“I understand, my Vicar.”

see 'that you have requested 
X assignment to one particular 
time. Colonel Odegard,” said the 
examining psychologist. ‘The two 
days Vincento spends near the town 
of Oihbog on the way to his trial, 
waiting to cross a flooded river. Had 
you any particular reason for want- 
ing those two days?” 

“Just that I know the locale very 
well. I once spent a long holiday 
there, and it was one of those places 
that didn’t change much in three or 
four hundred years.” Of course like 
everything else on the surface, the 
town land cathedral of Oibbog were 
in the past tense now. And of 
course Derron did have his own 
inner particular reason; the long 
holiday there had been with her. 

The psychologist threw one of his 
fast ibails. “Have you any reason 
for wanting to be a field agent at 
all?” 

One reason seemed to be Matt 
and Ay, their images blending into 
one kingly figure as they receded 
from the moving moment of the 
present, blending and seeming to 
grow larger with distance like a 
mountain when a man walked away 
from it. Derron didn’t know if he 
could put that into words, and he 
saw no need to try. 

“I know the period very well, as 



I said. I believe I can do a good 
job. Like everyone else, I want to 
win the war. I want prestige, I sup- 
pose. Accomplishment.” 

“I see.” The psychologist ruffled 
routinely 'through papers on his desk. 
“Just one more thing I want to 
bring up before approving you as 
agent material, Colonel. What are 
your personal religious views?” 
“Oh. Well frankly. I think that 
gods and temples are fine things for 
people who need crutches. I 
haven’t yet found any necessary.” 

“I see. I raise ithe point because 
of the dangers inherent in sending 
back to Vincento’s time anyone like- 
ly to find himself personally involved 
in the issues of that time. Taking 
sides. You as an historian know 
better than I how thick the air is 
back there with dogma and doc- 
trine. Religious controversy and 
warfare.” 

“I understand.” Derron shook his 
head calmly. “No, I’m no fanatic; 
I’ll play any part that’s necessary. 
I’ll be a rabid monk and spit on 
Vincento if required.” 

“That’s all right, then. But I 
rather think you’ll do better as a 
traveling scholar.” 

O perations gave him a name — 
Valzay — and started to build 
for him a character who had never 
historically existed and rushed him 
into preparation with about a dozen 
other agents, mostly male. Each 
agent was to stay watchfully near 
Vincento during a day or so of the 
critical period of his life. 

The training and preparation was 
rushed and rugged, beginning with 

I?

the siurgioal implanitatioa of com- 
munications tramsducers in jawbone 
and skull, so an agent could be in 
contact with Operations without be- 
ing seem to mumble aloud. Amid 
fatigue and concentration Derron 
noticed almost without surprise that 
Lisa was now employed in Opera- 
tions, one of the calm- voiced girls 
who relayed orders and information 
to sentries, and would do the same 
for slave-unit operators or live agents 
in the field. 

He had little free time and made 
no effort to use any of it to speak 
to her. Then one day as he sat rest- 
ing between training sessions, Lisa 
came passing by and stopped. 

“Derron, I want to wish you suc- 
cess.” 

“Thanks. Pull up a chair, if you 
like.” 

She did. “Derron, I shouldn’t have 
accused you of killing Matt. I know 
that wasn’t your intention and it 
wasn’t your fault. If Matt’s death 
had caused her anything more than 
brief sorro^v at a friend’s loss, she 
did not show it now. 

Derron said abruptly: “You and 
I might have had — something, 
Lisa. Perhaps not the whole thing 
there can be between a man and a 
woman, but still something good. At 
least I thought we might.” 

“I had some feeling like that 
about — Matt. But that wouldn’t 
have been enough for me.” 

He went on hurriedly: “As far as 
anyithing permanent and tremendous, 
well I’ve tried that already once in 
my life. And I’m still up to my 
neck in it, as you may have noticed. 
I’m sorry. I’ve got to get moving.” 



And he got up out of his chair 
and did so. 

T he experts dressed him in suit- 
able clothing, slightly worn. In 
his haversack they pHaced a reason- 
able supply of proper food, and in 
his wallet a moderate sum of piroper 
money, coins of silver and gold and 
a forged letter of credit on an Em- 
pire City bank. They hoped he would 
not need much money nor get as far 
as the Holy City. But just in case. 

Hung around Derron’s neck was 
an abominably carved wooden 
wedge-symbol, big enough to conceal 
the bulk of his communicator and 
too ugly for anyone to want to 
steal. If anyone was moved to won- 
der, it was a present from his wife. 

In an arsenal off Stage Three, they 
issued him a sturdy traveler’s staff, 
which was a more effective weapon 
by far than it appeared to be, and 
then at last they were ready to drop 
him. 

All the agents were going to be 
launched within half a minute, to 
emerge on different days and in dif- 
fent places. Their training and pre- 
paration had been too humed and 
too individualized for them to get 
to know one ^another very well; but 
for a few minutes there was joking 
camaraderie in Stage Three as the 
masquerade-costumed group bade 
one another good luck and good ber- 
serker-hunting. 

The launching file formed. Der- 
ron stood looking over the head of 
the agent ahead of him, a short 
man named Amling, who wore the 
garb of a traveling friar and who 
was to watch over Vi nee n to on the 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



19 




two days preceding Derron’s shift. 
®n the count, the line moved brisk- 
ly forward, disappearing one figure ’ 
after another. Amling vanished. 
Then in a long stride Derron’s boot- 
ed foot swung out over the mercurial 
circle and came down. 

H e was standing in darkness, in 
the open air. Except for a 
drizzle of rain, there was silence 
all about him, a lonely shence in 
which t his materialization must have 
been unseen. Good. 

As his eyes grew more accustomed 
to the gloom, he made out that the 
hard surface under his boots did 
seem to be that of the old Empire 
road which passed ithrough Oibbog. 
It seemed that the launching people 
had scored a bull’s-eye, spatially. 
Whether he had arrived at the 
proper time remained to be seen, 
though the rain was as it should be. 

Subvocalizing, he tried to reach 
Operations for a routine communica- 
tions check; but some kind of para- 
dox-loop seemed to be blocking con- 
tact. One ran into such things, and 
one would hope they would not last. 

When he felt sure no one was 
near, he opened his staff at one 
end and consulted the compass thus 
revealed to make sure he had the 
right direction ahead of him. Then 
he began to walk. Lightning flashed 
distantly at intervals, but the rain 
was slowly diminishing. He drew 
deep breaths of the washed air. 

The transducer behind his ear 
twinged suddenly. “Odegard, can 
you read me yet? It’s plus two days 
since you dropped. Time scale has 
been slipping.” 



“Affirmative. I’m about plus five 
minutes since dropping. Still on the 
road at night in the rain,” Derron 
was tapping along with his staff to 
keep from floundering off the pave- 
ment into the mud. 

“You’re blurring on the screens. 
But we think we dropped you about 
two miles from the cathedral, fur- 
ther than we intended. Have you 
ascertained your exact location yet?” 

“Negative. How’s the game go- 
ing?” 

“All the agents ahead of you are 
back with us, no problems. Except 
Amling. We haven’t been able to 
reach him, maybe just because of 
the time-slippage. Listen, Odegard, 
keep your eyes open. If you’re more 
than about two miles from Vincen- 
to, a violent attack on you will be 
possible — ” 

The waning lightning flared up, 
obligingly showing Derron his road 
running straight for some distance 
ahead, with the dim brooding cathe- 
dral at last visible to him on its far- 
off hill. Much nearer, the lightning 
also showed him a shiny object ly- 
ing in the center of the road, lying 
atop what seemed to be a line 
scratched or dug perpendicularly 
across the way. 

“Stand by. Operations.” Derron 
made his way cautiously up to the 
wet, soft thing, prodded it with a 
toe and waited for the lightning, 
which came again to show him Am- 
ling’s naked body. “Never mind 
looking in the blur for Amling’s 
lifeline. I guess he came down out- 
side the safety zone too.” 

He knelt briefly over the body, 
gripping his weapons staff while his 



20 



IF 




eyes searched the rainy night as 
best they could, and described the 
situation. The line had been scratch- 
ed at precise depth across the road 
by some tool or cybernetic limb that 
sliced stone like cheese; quite likely 
the same implement that had re- 
moved the back of Amling”s head. 
“Maybe it marked the boundary line 
of violence for us; just to let us 
know that it’s aware of it.” 

Derron did not dawdle there. For 
a time he walked backward toward 
Oibbog, staff ready, trying to probe 
with eyes and ears the rainy night 
as he recreated from it. Not that his 
senses, or his reactions, were likely 
to be good enough if the enemy was 
there. 

But he was spared. The berserker 
had killed in passing, where it could 
do so safely, and then had gone on 
about its real business. 

V 

B y the time Derron reached the 
place where the road bent sharp- 
ly to the left toward the wash-out 
bridge, the lightning had gone on 
over the horizon, so he felt rather 
than saw the bulk of the hill and 
cathedral ahead of him and above. 
But close by the side of the road he 
could now make out the monastery 
wall, the broken gate and, just in- 
side the gateway, Vincento’s coach 
deserted in the puddles. From the 
shelter of a cloister came the gentle 
mumbling and grunting of load- 
beasts. Derron paused only a mo- 
ment before plodding through the 
gate and across the soggy earth to 
the entrance of the main building. 

MOTHER BERSERKER 



He made no effort to be quiet, 
and the dark entrance promptly 
emitted a challenge: “Who’s there? 
Stand and give our name!” 

The dialect was one Derron had 
exp>ected. He stopped, and as the 
beam of a lantern flicked out at him, 
he answered: “I am Valzay of Mos- 
nar, mathematicus and scholar. 
From the coach and animals I see 
here, I judge that you within are 
honest men. And I have need of 
shelter.” 

A door creaked, and behind the 
door the lantern retreated. “Step 
for’ard, then.” 

Derron advanced slowly. When 
he had gotten in out of the rain he 
found himself in what had been the 
common room of the monastery, 
facing a pair of soldiers. One of these 
was armed with a crude pistol and 
the Other with a short sword; judg- 
ing by their uniforms, they were 
from a mercenary company. 

When they could see his gentle- 
man’s clothes more plainly, their 
manner became more or less re- 
spectful. “Well, sir, how d’you come 
to be a-wandering afoot and alone?” 

He told how his skittish loadbeast, 
scared by lightning, had run off with 
his light sulky. A plague on the ani- 
mal! If he could catch it in the 
morning, he’d have some of its hide 
off! With whip-cracking vehemence 
he shook water from his hat. 

Derron had an effortless feel for 
acting when there was a need. The 
soldiers chuckled, relaxed most of 
their vigilance, became willing to 
chat. There was certainly plenty of 
room here for another boarder — 
the proprietary monks had left long 

21 




ago. The place was no tavern with 
girls and ale; even firewood was 
in short supply, but the roof did keep 
the rain off. Yes, they were from 
a mercenary company, one now in 
the pay of the Holy Temple. Their 
captain with the builk of his men was 
in Oibbog, which was just across the 
river. 

They still harbored some suspicion 
of Derron — he might conceivably 
be a scout for some well organized 
band of brigands — so they did not. 
tell him how many soldiers had 
been caugiht on this side of the tor- 
rent when the bridge collapsed. He 
did not ask, of course, but he 
gathered that there were not very 
many. 

“And if the cap’n can’t do more’n 
wave to us for the next couple days, 
why that’s all right with us, hey 
what?” 

“Naw, no one else but the old 
gentletnan as owns the coach and 
his servant an’ his driver. And a 
pair of friars. Plenty empty cells, 
sir, so take your pick. One’s about 
as damp as the next.” 

Derron murmured his thanks and, 
with some brief help from the lan- 
tern, groped his way down a pas- 
sage and into a vacant cell, door- 
less now like all the others. Built 
against ithe rear wall was a wooden 
bunk frame that had not yet been 
ripp>ed out for firewood, and on that 
he sat down. The rush of events had 
left him a little numb; he still could 
not quite grasp that Vincent Vin- 
cento was here somewhere within a 
few meters of 'him, might ev^ be 
the author of the snore that echoed 
faintly down the passage. 



D erron streached out on the 
wooden frame, knapsack under 
his head; genuinely i^ired, he found 
himself dozing toward sleep. His 
thoughts as consciousness dulled 
were filled not with Vincento or time 
travel or even berserkers, but simply 
with the sound of fading rain and 
the freshness of the infinite dean 
atmosphere around him. It was the 
theme of resurrection . 

He had been asleep for a few 
minutes when Operations put a 
throbbing behind his right ear. He 
came wide awake at once and tuck- 
ed his carven wedge-symbol doser 
under his chin. 

“Odegard, you’rd in the monastery 
all right?” 

“Affirmative.” 

“Good. Now we’re getting our 
screens tuned in. There lare (fourteen 
lifelines in or near that monastery- 
temple complex, counting your own. 
One of course is Vincento’s. One 
seems to be an unborn child’s, you 
know how th'cy show on a screen 
in dots and da^es.” 

Derron mused sulbvocally. “Let’s 
see. Me, Vincento, his two servants, 
and the two soldiers I’ve seen. That 
makes six. And they said there were 
two friars. Eight, which would leave 
six more unaccounted for. Probably 
four more soldiers and a camp- fol- 
lower who’s picked up something 
she won’t want to carry — though 
that one soldier did say something 
about there being no girls. Anyway, 
I suppose your idea is there may be 
some apparent person here who has 
no 'Hfdine showing on your screens 
— our hypothetical berserker-and- 
roid.” 



22 



IF 




‘That’s precisely our idea, yes.” 
“Tomorrow I can count noses and 
ve’ll see . wait.” 

At the entrance of Derron’s cell 
% shape of lesser blackness became 
^screte and moved. The figure of a 
tiooded friar, utterly faceless in the 
^oom, came a halfstep inside before 
halting abruptly and muttered a few 
indistinguishable words that might 
have been an apology for entering 
the wrong cell. The figure then with- 
drew as silently it had come. 

Derr on was gripping his staff, 
pointing it at the dooi*way. “Just had 
a short visit from someone. Or may- 
be from something. Maybe that’s 
where Amling’s robe went.” 

Hours passed before Derron dozed 
again. 

W hen Vincento was awakened in 
darkness to find himself 
bedded amid damp straw, with bare 
stone walls close about him, he 
knew a moment of sinking terror. 
The worst had already hap{>ened, 
and he lay in the Defender’s dung- 
eon. The terror was deepened when 
he saw the monk-hooded figure 
bending over him. He could see in 
the moonlight which filtered now 
through the tiny window. Evidently 
the rain was over — 

The rain — of course, he was 
still on his way to the Holy City 
for his trial! 

The intensity of his relief was such 
that Vincento accepted his being 
awakened almost with courtesy. 
“What is it?” he gasped, sitting up 
on his shelf of a t>^, pulling his 
traveling-rug closer about his shoul- 
ders. His manservant Will slept on a 



bundled mound on the dark floor. 

The visitor’s hooded face could 
not be seen; the visitor’s voice was 
a sepulchral whisper; “Messire Vin- 
cento, come alone to the cathedral 
tomorrow. At the crossways of nave 
and transepts you will receive good 
news, from your friends in high 
places.” 

Could Nabur or Belam be send- 
ing him some secret word? Or, more 
likely, was this some Defenders’s 
trickery? A man summoned to trial 
was not supposed to discuss the mat- 
ter with anyone. 

“It will be good news, Messire 
Vincento. Come alone and be will- 
ing to wait if you are not met at 
once. And do not seek to know my 
name or face.” 

Vincento held his silence; he 
would commit himself to nothing. 
But the visitor, satisfied that the 
message had been heard, melted 
away into the night. 

W hen Vincento awakened again, 
it was from a pleasant dream. 
He had been back on the estate pro- 
vided for him by the Senate of his 
city, safe in his own bed, with his 
mistress’s warm body solid and com- 
forting beside him. In reality the 
woman had been gone for some 
time — women no longer meant 
very much — but the estate was still 
there. If only they would let him 
return to it in peace! 

He had been awakened this time 
by the touch on his face of a shaft 
of morning sunlight, which came 
striking into his cell from the high 
thin window of the opposite cell 
across the corridor. As he lay re- 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



23 




caUing with curiosity his strange 
midnight visitor, the sun-shaft was 
fiik)wly moving away from his face. 
That motion made it instantly, for 
him, a golden pendulum of subtle 
torture. 

He faced also the pendulum of 
choice. His mind could swing one 
way, tick, and meet in foresight the 
shame of swallowed truth and pride, 
the humiliation of an enforced re- 
canting. And the other way, tock, 
there would be the breaking agony 
of the boot or the rack, or slower 
destruction in a buried cell. 

Oh, of course, the crude physical 
torture was a remote threat only. He 
would have to be very obstinate 
and outspoken before the Defenders 
would go that far with him. But it 
was not impossible. They would say 
that a stubborn defendant forced 
them to employ such means. 

So his pendulum of choice was not 
real; he had no real choice but to 
recant. Let the sun move as they 
want it to. Let it whirl round the 
globe in an insane yearly spiral, to 
please arrogant fools who thought 
they could read all the secrets of the 
universe in a few dusty pages of the 
Holy Writings. 

Lying on his back, Vincento 
rais^ a hand veined with ropy ves- 
sels against the slow-swiveling tor- 
ture-blade of the sun. But the sun 
would not be stopped in its motion 
by any man’s hand. It mocked him 
all the more, making bright translu- 
cent wax out of the oldness of his 
fingers. 

On the floor. Will stirred slug- 
gishly in his rug-cocoon. Vincento 
barked him awake and chased him 



out to rouse the coachman Rudd, 
who slept beside the beasts — Rudd 
to look at the river’s level. Will 
to start getting something together 
for breakfast. 

Left alone, he began the slow 
humiliating process of getting his 
aging bones unlimbered and ready 
for what the day might bring. In 
recent years his health had been 
poor. But he was not sick now, only 
old. And yes, he was afraid. 

By the time Will came to inform 
him that a fire and hot tea were 
ready in the monastery’s common 
room, Vincento was ready also. 

W ith mild surprise he found a 
new arrival in the common 
room, a youngster who introduced 
himself as Valzay of the distant land 
of Mosnar. Valzay made, as he put 
it, a modest claim to scholarship. 
And for a wonder he was decently 
respectful — he looked at Vincento 
with genuine, if restrained, awe and 
murmured that even in bis distant 
homeland Vincento’s discoveries 
were known and praised. 

Vincento acknowledged all this 
with pleasant nods, sipping his 
morning tea, wondering if this Val- 
zay was the bearer of the good news 
he was supposed to hear from some- 
one in the cathedral. Anyway he was 
not going to rush up there at once; 
Rudd reported that the river was no 
longer rising, but still too high and 
dangerous at this point for anyone 
to think of fording it. One more 
day, maybe. 

So Vincento took his time consum- 
ing tea and a little food, told Rudd 
to give the two friars something if 

IP

they came round, then strolled 
leisurely out into the sunshine to 
warm his bones. If he came late to 
his trial, there were plenty of wit- 
nesses here to tell the reason. Let 
the Defenders inveigh against the 
river, if they liked. No doubt it 
would dry up for them. No doubt 
all of nature could be made to do 
their bidding if they but threatened 
it enough. 

But he must begin to practice his 
humility. He called to WiU to bring 
him his writing materials from the 
coach, and he went to sit alone in 
the sun outside the broken monas- 
tery gate, with one tumbled block 
of stone for a bench and another 
for a table. 

It was really about time he started 
writing his statement of recantation 
for the trial. Of course, the accused 
was not supposed to know why he 
had been summoned — probably 
the Defenders’s first question would 
be whether he had any idea of what 
he was charged with. But in his case 
there could hardly be any doubt. 
It had been fifteen years since the 
warning, which Vincento had half- 
forgotten; but when the summons 
came, he realized he had made 
enemies among men who never for- 
got anything. 

T he first paper he pulled from 
his portable escritoire was the 
old letter from Defender Belam. In- 
voluntarily Vinoento’s eye went at 
once to the words: “. no proof 
of our globe's motion exists, as I 
believe, since none has been shown 
to me." 

No proof. Vincento wiped at his 



forehead with a tremulous hand. 
Now, with mortal fear to enforce 
bleak clarity of thought, he could 
see that the arguments he had con- 
jured up from tides and sunspots 
really proved nothing about the mo- 
tion of sun and planets. The truth 
about those motions had come to 
him before he had ever thought of 
proving it — he had looked long 
through telescopes, he had thought 
long and deeply, his mind weighing 
the sun and grasping at stars and 
comets; and truth had come through 
some inward door, like — just like 
a revelation. 

His enemies who cried him down 
were blind and stupid in their re- 
fusal, or their inability, to see. And 
yet he knew that those who were to 
sit as his judges were shrewd logici- 
ans, within their limitations. If only 
there were something firm that he 
could set simply and incontrovertibly 
before them ... oh, what would he 
not give! 

His mind ached, and his fists 
clenched, his very guts contracted 
at the thought. If he had one solid 
simple proof he would risk all, he 
would dare anything to confront and 
confound them with it, to rub their 
long arrogant noses in the very ob- 
vious truth! 

But since there was nothing to sup- 
port this mood of glorious defiance, 
it soon passed. The truth was he 
was old and afraid, and he would 
recant. 

Slowly he got out pen and ink, 
and slowly he began his first draft. 
From time to time he paused, sitting 
in the sun with closed eyes, trying 
not to think.

VI 



D erron counted seven soldiers 
round the breakfast fire and 
found each of them overjoyed to 
accept a swallow of brandy from 
his traveling flask and willing enough 
to talk. No, there was no one else 
in the monastery or cathedral or 
nearer than the town across the 
river. Not that they knew of. 

When he was alone a few minutes 
later, Derron did some subvocal 
mumbling. “Operations? Count the 
lifelines here again. I make it thir- 
teen of us. If you can make it 
twelve, then one of my smiling com- 
panions has clockwork for guts. But 
if you come out with fourteen again, 
th^ either there’s some bandit or 
deserter lurking in a corner or you’re 
misreading. I think you’re misread- 
ing that dotted line, anyway; I con- 
sider it unlikely that any of us here 
is pregnant, since we’re all men.” 
Operations was apologetic. “We’ll 
recheck right away; you know it’s 
not easy reading these things.” 
After finishing their morning 
meal and emptying Derron’s bran- 
dy flask, most of the soldiers settled 
down to serious loafing. Rudd, Vin- 
cento’s coachman, led his loadbeasts 
forth in search of grass. Following 
them through the gate, Derron lo- 
cated Vincento, sitting peacefully 
alone and apart. Well and good. 

Remembering his mythical load- 
beast and sulky, Derron put on an 
exasperated expression and strolled 
along the road toward the bridge- 
stump, scanning the muddy fields on 
either side as if in search of his 
property. 



At the bridge-stump were the two 
friars, gray cowls thrown back from 
their unremarkable heads. They 
seemed to be talking of ways in 
which the bridge might sometime 
be rebuilt. Derron knew that within 
a year or two, the river would be 
spanned here by new arches of stone. 
And those arches would still be 
standing solidly more than three 
hundred years later, when a young 
postgraduate history student would 
come on a hiking tour with the 
girl he loved, enthusiastic about see- 
ing the town and cathedral of Oibbog 
. the river would look much dif- 
ferent then, gentler of course and 
with more trees along its banks. 
While the stones of the road would 
still look much the same . 

yTay the Holy One give you a 
iVl good day, esteemed sir!” It 
was the stouter of the friars whose 
voice broke in upon the start of re- 
verie. 

The interruption was welcome. 
“Good day to you also, reverend 
brothers, in His name. Does the 
river stiU rise?” 

The thinner friar had a loving 
face. In hands all bone and tendon 
he held a chunk of masonry, as if 
he meant to start this minute fo re- 
build the bridge. ‘The river falls 
now, sir. How goes the path of your 
life, up or down?” 

The falsehood about beast and 
buggy seemed dreary and unneces- 
sary. “That can hardly be an easy 
question for any man to answer.” 
Seven or eight of the local peas- 
antry had materialized out of mud 
and distance and were plodding their 



26 



IF 




barefoot way along the drying bank 
of the torrent toward the bridge- 
stump. One walking in front swung 
proudly in his hand a string of 
large and silvery fish, fresh enough 
to be still twitching and twisting. 

A few paces away the peasants 
halted. Together they bowed rather 
perfunctorily in Derron’s direction; 
he was not dressed finely enough to 
overawe anyone, and plainly he was 
not the one <hey had come to see. 
The man with the fish began talking 
to the friars, and almost at once 
others interrupted him, all squab- 
bling over who had the right to 
speak first and who the right of dis- 
posal of the fish. They had come to 
strike a bargain. Would the holy 
brothers accept one of these fine fish 
(“From me!” “From me, Holy 
Brother, it was my fishline!”) and 
in return say some potent prayers 
for the giver’s crops? 

Derron turned away from what 
gave promise of becoming a nasty 
quarrel among the peasants to see 
that Vincento was still alone. And 
the full sunlit view of the Cathedral 
of Oibbog caught Derron unawares. 

The tip of the central spire held 
its symbolic wedge two hundred and 
sixty feet above the flattened hill- 
top. The stones of tower and wall, 
of arch and flying buttress were 
rich clear gray, almost shining in 
the morning light. Inside, the stain- 
ed glass would be living flame along 
the eastern wall. There was only 
one sight in all the world like this, 
and he had seen it only once be- 
fore, with his beloved at his side. 
If air and grass were now aJive 
again, surely she too must be alive 



and somewhere near where he might 
reach her. The resurrected reality be- 
fore him was at the moment more 
convincing than any thought or, 
logic. At any moment now he might 
hear her voice, might be able to 
reach out and touch . 

There was a splash nearby. The 
stout friar was wearing a caricature 
expression of anger, disappointment 
and surprise, while the t hinn er one 
stood with a hand stretched out over 
the water. As Derron watched, a 
big fish jumped and splashed again; 
one of the slippery catch had evident- 
ly escaped. 

. touch her warm and living 
skin. The way her hair moved in 
the wind came back to him now, 
with the clarity of something seen 
only a minute ago. 

His feet took him away from the 
bridge, back along the road. He saw 
without really thinking that Vin- 
cento still sat alone in the sun. 

The hill raised its cathedral before 
Derron, and his feet began a steady 
climb. 

J ovann was looking sadly at the 
peasants, while he addressed the 
splasher in the water. “Brother Fish, 

I have given you liberty not because 
we do not need food, but so you 
may be able to praise God, who 
sends all blessings — the fish to 
the angler, or freedom to the fish. 
We men so often forget to be thank- 
ful!” 

The fish splashed and leaped and 
splashed again. As if the pain of 
the hook or the time spent gilling 
air — or something else — had 
driven it quite mad. 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



27 




Jovann looked down at this watery 
uproar in distress. “Be still now, 
Brother Fish. Enough! Live in the 
water, not the painful air. Give 
praise and thanks as a fish may 
naturally do!” 

The splashing stopped. The last 
ripples and foam were swept away 
downstream. 

Every peasant’s hands were raised 
in the wedge-sign, and they darted 
their eyes at one another as if they 
would have liked to run but dared 
not. Brother Saile’s face gaped as 
blankly as had the fish’s, as his eyes 
^ung from Jovann to the river and 
back again. 

Jovann beckoned Saile away and 
said to him: “I am going apart for 
an hour, to pray the Holy One to 
cleanse me of anger and pride. And 
for these poor men’s crops. Do you 
likewise.” And Jovann walked 
away alone, following the riverbank 
in the opposite direction from the 
peasants. 

A s Derron climbed the steps that 
switchbacked up the face of 
the cathedral hill, it crossed his 
mind that at this moment in time 
the genes of the girl he loved were 
scattered in the chromosomes of 
some two thousand ancestors. Only 
in such a tenuous sense was she 
alive today. 

He had never forgiven her for 
dying, for being helplessly killed 
with all the other millions, for 
emptying his world. So, he told him- 
self, forgive her now, today. Get it 
all over with, out of your system 
once and for all, so you can be some 
good to yourself. 

28 



Now the roof of the monastery 
was below the level of his climbing 
feet. And now his eyes rose above 
the level of the paved space before 
the cathedral door. 

Here all seemed to him just as he 
remembered it. He stood upon the 
very stones where her feet and his 
would one day stand, facing the 
same hedges and statues along the 
cathedral’s front. Holiday and love 
might still be true, war and grief 
no more than bad dreams. 

But it was she who was the dream 
now, who would never again be any- 
thing more. For a moment the 
knowledge was almost too much, 
still — he thought he might be go- 
ing to kneel down or fall down or 
cry aloud — but then it could be 
accepted, at last, at long long last. 

He was not going to collapse or 
even cry out. They had looked out 
over the valley from here and talk- 
ed about building their home on 
some nearby spot, the home for the 
kids they were going to have. Now 
he was just going to stand here and 
go on living. 

The crisis building up in him 
since he had known he might see 
Oibbog again slowly faded. Peace 
and stillness reigned. 

He had still to go into the build- 
ing, where he had spent a morning 
helping her photograph stained glass. 
He wished he could be lucky enough 
to find the supposed author of the 
universe inside; Derron would have 
a few pointed questions to ask. 

The main door was just as solidly 
hung as he remembered it; he won- 
dered briefly if a wooden door might 
last three hundred years. No matter. 

IF 




He tugged it open and heard the 
booming reverberation of the broken 
closure come back from the cavern- 
ous interior. And only then did he 
recall that his staff with all its 
weaponry was resting back in his 
monastery cell. No matter; imme- 
diate violence from the berserker 
was not a danger. 

H e went in and paced down the 
center of the enormous nave. 
There was nothing to be seen of 
God or berserker, nor for that mat- 
ter of deserter or pregnant waif 
whose lifeline might be showing up 
to confuse operations. 

There would seem to be room in 
here for all of them to hide. The 
arched nave was about three hun- 
dred feet long and a hundred feet 
high for most of that length. Con- 
struction had not been quite com- 
pleted when the workmen had been 
ordered or frightened off the job; 
much scaffolding still surrounded 
columns and clung to walls, and a 
few abandoned tools were very slow- 
ly gathering dust where they had 
been set down. 

Whether because of the combat- 
ants’s reverence or superstitious awe, 
or only by chance, war had not 
trampl^ here. Even the stained glass 
was all intact, splintered only by the 
sun coming in to fire the gloom 
with richness. This main body of 
the temple was now no more than 
a few decades old. The paving stones 
of the nave, the wide steps leading 
to side chapels, all were flat and 
unworn; three centuries and more 
of random footsteps would be need- 
ed to shape them into standard dis- 



tribution curves. Here and there the 
workmen’s cables and ropes hung 
from the scaffolding, as steady in 
the motionless air as if carved from 
stone themselves. 

As Derron approached the inter- 
section of transepts and nave, a 
movement caught the corner of his 
eye. One of the friars, hood worn 
over his head, here in God’s house, 
was approaching him. 

Derron cleared his throat. “Rever- 
end Brother.” And then it struck him 
as odd, that one of the two men he 
had left at the bridge should have 
hurried here ahead of him. Peering 
closely, he saw that the face beneath 
the cowl was not quite a face. The 
hands reaching to grab him as the 
figure shot forward were dummy 
flesh, split open now to show the 
steel claws. 

A little mob of peasants was 
coming up the road from the 
bridgehead, babbling loudly of mi- 
racles and fish. The noise was dis- 
tracting, and in truth Vincento was 
only too ready to let himself be dis- 
tracted from his humiliating task. He 
summoned Will, gave him the escri- 
toire and papers to take in charge 
and then turned his own steps rest- 
lessly upward in the fine sunlight. 

He had decided that the meeting 
supposedly arranged in the cathedral 
was probably some Defenders’s* 
snare. Let them try! he would see 
through it before they had gotten 
very far. No more than the oafs 
who called themselves scholars were 
clerics Vincento’s equals in clever- 
ness. It was only the Defenders’s 
power he respected and feared, 
never their brains. 



30 



IP 




He was patient with his old legs, 
and so they served him well enough 
-,on the climb. After a pause at the 
top to breathe, he entered at the 
cathedral’s main door, tugging it 
firmly closed behind him. He de- 
voutly hoped that no one was going 
to meet him to offer sympathy. A 
sympathizer always had at least 
some implied claim to be the equal 
— or even the superior! — of the 
one he tried to console. Pah! 

Vincento strolled through the 
nave, a stone-sealed space too vast 
to give the least sense of confine- 
ment. To his right and left, columns 
towered in their parallel rows. With 
distance the apparent gap between 
each column and the next diminish- 
ed, until at fifty paces each row 
became opaque as a wall. No matter 
where a man stood inside this un- 
partitioned space, half of it would 
always be blocked from his view — 
more than half, if one counted the 
areas of the transept-arms and the 
chapels. 

W hen he reached the appointed 
meeting place, the crossways 
of nave and transepts, Vincento 
could look directly up nearly two 
hundred feet, into the shadowed in- 
terior of the mighty spire. There 
were workmen’s platforms there too, 
reached by ladders mounting from 
the clerestory level, where must be 
the upper end of some stair that 
coiled up within the wall from floor 
level. 

In this temple ithere were no 
chandeliers and no breezes to swing 
them if they had existed. If in Vin- 
cento’s youth this had been his 



parish house of worship, he could 
hardly have begun, during a drowsy 
Sabbath sermon, to discover the 
laws of pendulums. 

A single cable of great length 
descended thinly from the uttermost 
dark interior of the spire. Vincen- 
to’s eye followed it down, to find 
that after all there was a pendulum 
here, at least in potential. For a 
bob, there hung on the end of 
the long cable a ball of metal that 
would be heavy as a man. This 
weight was caught and held by the 
merest loop of cord to one of the 
huge columns at a corner of the 
nave-transept intersection. 

Looking up and down, up and 
down again tended to make an old 
man dizzy. Vincento rubbed his 
neck. But what use could the build- 
ers have had for such a patriarch of 
pendulums? It could, Vincento sup- 
posed, be something they swung 
when hard stone and mortar had to 
be demolished. Or was it only a 
plumb-line made gigantic? 

Whatever they had intended it for, 
it was a pendulum. The restraining 
tether of cord, with its single 
knot, looked insubstantial. Vincento 
thrummed the taut little cord with 
his finger, and gently the long long 
cable whipped and swayed. The 
massive weight made tiny bobbing 
motions, dipping like a ship at an- 
chor. 

Quickly the oscillations died 
away; the cathedral stillness regain- 
ed ascendancy. Cord and weight 
and cable were once more as steady 
as the stone columns in the still 
gray air. The pendulum-ship was 
dry docked. 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



31 




Set sail, then! On impulse Vin- 
cento tugged once at the end of the 
knotted restraining cord. And with 
startling ease the knot dissolved. 

Starting from rest, the weight for 
a moment seemed reluctant to move. 
Even after it had undeniably begun 
its first swing, it still moved so 
slowly that Vincento’s eye raced in- 
voluntarily once more up into the 
shadows of the spire, to see how it 
was possible that mere length of 
cord should so delay things. 

A man might have counted four 
without haste before the weight for 
the first time reached the center, 
the low-point, of its swing. Almost 
touching the floor, it passed that 
center in a smooth fast rush and 
immediately began to slow again, 
so that it needed four more counts 
to climb the gentle gradient of the 
far half of its arc. Then an un- 
measurable instant’s pause, not quite 
touching a column on the other side 
of the crossways, before the weight 
edged into its returning motion. 

Back and forth it went, in a per- 
fectly straight track about ten yards 
in length. Vincento’s eye could find 
no diminution in the amplitude of 
the first half-dozen swings. He sup- 
posed that a heavy weight swinging 
so freely might continue to oscillate 
for many hours or even for days. 

But wait. Vincento squinted at the 
pendulum. Holding hjs head motion- 
less he watched it closely through 
another half dozen swings. 

W hat was it he had come in here 
for? Oh yes, someone was per- 
haps going to meet him. 

But this pendulum. He frowned 



at it and shook his head. He was 
going to have to make sure of some- 
thing that he thought he -saw. 

Workmen’s sawhorses stood not 
far away. He dragged a pair of these 
to where he wanted them, then 
spanned them with a plank, which 
lay beneath the end of the pendu- 
lum’s arc and perpendicular to its 
direction. On the bottom of the 
swinging weight he had noticed a 
projection like a small spike — 
whatever it had been designed for, 
it would serve Vincento’s present 
purpose well. He laid a second board 
atop the first and readjusted his 
whole structure slightly. Now on 
each swing the spike passed within 
an inch of the topmost board. 

Somewhere in here he had seen 
sand . yes, piled there in a mix- 
ing-trough, by the entrance to the 
first side-chapel. The sand was damp 
with the long spell of wet weather; 
he brought handfuls and dumped 
them on the upper board, where he 
patted and built the sand into a small 
wall, an inch or two high, along 
the board’s length. Then in an in- 
terval between swings he slid his 
upper board slightly forward, tak- 
ing his sand -wall into the edge of 
the pendulum’s arc. 

A neatly designed experiment, he 
thought. On its first return the mov- 
ing spike notched his little sand 
wall delicately, tumbling a tiny clot 
of grains down tlie minute slope. 
Then the weight pulled its taut cable* 
away again, taking another nibble 
of eternity. 

Vincento held his breath, held his 
eyes from blinking as he watched 
the pendulum’s return. Now he heard 



32 



IF 




for the first time the faint ghostly 
hissing of its passage. 

The spike coming back to the wall 
•f sand made a new notch, though 
one contiguous to the first. Then in 
movement huge and regular enough 
to be the cathedral’s stately pulse, 
the weight once more departed. 

And the third notch was new 
again, by the same margin and in the 
same direction as the second. In 
three vibrations the plane of the pen- 
dulum had shifted its extremity side- 
ways by half a finger width. His 
eyes had not deceived him earlier; 
it was creeping regularly clockwise. 

Perhaps some slow untwisting of 
the cable? Then it should soon re- 
verse itself, Vincento thought, or at 
least vary in amplitude. Again he 
stared up into the high shadows. 

He would have to hang another 
pendulur. like this somewhere, 
someday, and study it at leisure. If 
he could. Even supposing that his 
health held out and he was spared 
prison, it would be difficult. En- 
closed towers of this height were 
anything but common. In another 
temple or at some university, per- 
haps . but he had no intention 
of stooping to collaboration. 

. suppose now that the sideways 
progression was not due to the cable 
unwinding. He thought he could feel 
that it was not — in somewhat the 
same way as, after study, he had 
come to feel the stability of the sun. 
This clockwise creeping had some- 
thing too elemental about it for him 
to be able to credit a trivial cause. 

Already the width of two fingers 
had been nibbled from the top of 
his little parapet of sand. 



He wondered how the cable was 
fastened at the top. Younger legs 
than his would be required to find 
that out, and Vincento departed to 
get them. Several times in his pas- 
sage down the nave he turned, 
frowning back at the pendulum as 
he might have stared at an unexpect- 
ed star. 

VII 

O f it all, Derron had seen only an 
upper segment of the moving 
cable. He saw even that much with 
only one eye, for his face was being 
held with steady force against the 
rough planking of the high platform 
to which the berserker had carried 
him, helpless as a kicking infant. 
Inhumanly motionless, it crouched 
over him now, one chill hand grip- 
ping his neck and holding part of 
his garment gaglike in his mouth, 
the other hand twisting one of his 
arms just to the point of pain. 

Obviously it had no intention of 
killing or crippling him. Still his 
captivity felt more like eternity than 
time, though measured by the mean- 
ingless regularity of the swinging 
cable. Having his prisoner, the ber- 
serker was content to wait, which 
meant that he had failed. It had 
at once known his communicator 
for what it was, had ripped 
the wooden carving from his neck 
and cracked it like a thin-shelled nut, 
squeezing the meat of metal and 
components into trash between its 
fingers. 

Only when the cathedral door far 
below had boomed shut once more 
did eternity begin to come to an 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



33 





end. The berserker then let him go. 

Slowly and painfully he raised his 
numbed body from the wood. Rub- 
bing the arm that had been twisted, 
he turned to face his enemy. Under 
the cowl he saw a pattern of seamed 
metal that looked as if it might be^ 
able to open and slide and reshape 
itself. Was there plastic somewhere^ 
inside that could evert to become | 
the mask of a human face? There | 
was no way to tell that much, let \ 
alone guess what identity it might 
be able to wear. 

“Colonel Odegard,” it said, in a 
voice machine-tailored to neutrality. 

He waited for more, while the 
thing facing him on the high plat- 
form squatted on its heels, arms 
hanging limp. Like the face, the 
hands were ambiguous; they were 
not human now, but there was no 
saying what they might be able to 
become. The rest of the thing was 
hidden under the shapeless robe, 
which had probably once been 
Amling’s. 

“Colonel Odegard, do you fear 
the passage from life to not-life?” 

He didn’t know what he had ex- 
pected to hear, but hardly that. 
“And if I do, what difference does 
it make?” 

“Yes,” said the berserker. “What 
is programmed goes on regardless 
of any passage.” 

Before he could try to make any 
sense out of that, the machine jump- 
ed precisely forward and grabbed 
him again. He struggled again, which 
of course made no difference. It tore 
strips from his coat, ripping the 
tough cloth with precise and even 
sounds. With the strips it gagged him

IF 





again and tied him hand and foot 
tightly, buit still not so tihat h© 
felt hopeless of ever working free. 
It would not blunder into causing 
his death, here where it must be 
careful not to kill. When it had 
bound him, the machine paused for 
a moment, moving its cowled head 
like a listening man, searching the 
area with senses far beyond the hu- 
man. And then it was gone, down 
the ladder in utter silence, like a 
giant cat or ape. 

He strained desperately to get 
loose, choking curses on his gag. 

F rom some village in the hills a 
second group of peasants had 
come along the road to the cath- 
edral. It was Brother Saile they met 
first; their anxious faces fell even 
further when they learned he was 
not the saint and niiracle-^worker of 
whom the whole countryside was 
talking. 

‘Tell me, what is it you wish to 
see Brother Jovann about?” Saile in- 
quired, his hands clasped with dig- 
nity across his belly. 

They clamored piteously. For the 
past several xdays a great wolf had 
terrorized their little village, killing 
cattle and even a child and even — 
they swore it! — uprooting crops. 
They were isolated and very poor, 
with no powerful patron to give them 
aid of any kind, save only the Holy 
One himself! And now the saintly 
Jovann, who must and would do 
something. They were utterly desper- 
ate. 

Brother Sale nodded, ihis face 
showing sympathy mixed with reluc- 
tance. “And your viillage is several 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



miles distant? In die bills. Well — 
we sihall see. Come wiitih me, and 
I will put your case before good 
Brother Jovann.” 

W ith a puzzled Will beside him, 
Vincento entered the cathedral 
once more and hurried down the 
nave. Rudd had bothered him, com- 
plaining of ithe scarcity of food for 
the loadbeasts. And then his old 
legs had rebelled against climbing 
the hill a second time. Now, when 
he got back to the still-swinging 
penduiium, more than an hour had 
passed since he had first set it in 
motion. The tiny ibattlement of sand 
had been demolished by continuous 
notches, up to the point where the 
pendulum’s plane had left it ibehind 
altogether. By now that plane had 
inched clockwise through ten or 
twelve degrees of arc. 

“Will, you’ve helped me in the 
workshop. Now this is another such 
case, where you must do precisely 
what I say.” 

“Aye, master.” 

“First, keep in mind that you are 
not to stop or disturb the swinging 
of the cable here. Understood?” 
“Aye.” 

“Now I want you to climb; there 
seem to be ladders and platforms 
enough for you to go up all the way. 
I want to learn how this swinging 
cable is mounted, what holds it at 
the top. Look at it until you can 
draw me a sketch, you’re good at 
that.” 

“Aye, I understand, sir.” Will 
craned his neck unhappily. “It’s a 
long bit o’ climbing, though.” 

“Yes, yes, a coin for you when 



you’re down. Another when you’ve 
given me a good sketch. Take your 
time now and use your eyes. And 
do not disturb the cable’s swing.” 

Derroo had made only slight prog- 
ress toward' loosing his ‘hands, when 
he heard clumsier feet than the ber- 
serker’s olimibing toward him. Then 
between the uprights of the ladder 
Wni’s honest face came into view 
to predictably register shock. 

“. bandit!” Derron spat, when 
his hands had been cut free and he 
could rid himself of the gag. 
“Must’ve been hiding in here some- 
where . forced me up here and 
tied me up.” 

Wondering and sympathetic. Will 
shook his head. “Likely he’d ’a slit 
your throat, sir, but didn’t want to 
do no sacrilege. Think he might still 
be here about?” 

“No, I’m sure he was running 
away.” 

“Long gone, then, by this time.” 
Will shook his head. “You’d better 
liven up your limbs, sir, before you 
starts to climb down. I’m going on 
up, bit of a job to do for master.” 

“Job?” 

“Aye.” Will was already climb- 
ing again, right into the spire. 

Still on all fours, Derron peered 
over the edge of the platform. Vin- 
cento’s ginger-colored hair marked 
a toy figure more than a hundred 
feet below. Down there the myster- 
ious moving cable ended in a dot 
which traced back and forth with 
sedate regularity . 

Derron’s muscles locked, and he 
felt himself near falMng. He had 
suddenly understood what Vincento 
was looking at, what Vincento had 



36 



IF 




probably been studying all tihe while 
the berserker held Derron captive. 
Its earliest designers on old Earth 
had called it a Foucault pendulum. 

vm 

C ^ T T onorable Vincento!” 

jni Vincento looked around in 
surprise and some annoyance as the 
young man, Alzay or Valzay or 
whatever his name was, came hurry- 
ing toward him from the foot of 
the tiny stair by which Will had be- 
gun his climb. 

Valzay rushed up, babbling some 
imbecilic story about a bandit, 
spouting pestiferous wordage that 
threatened to tangle Vincento’s 
thoughts. 

“Young man, I suggest you give 
your recitation to the soldiers.” Now, 
if it was not the cable untwisting, 
and proved to be not some trick 
of the mounting above . certainly 
the bones of the cathedral were not 
creeping counterclockwise ... but 
yet his mind strained forward into 
unknown territory . 

“I see, Messire Vincento, that 
you have discovered my little sur- 
prise.” Derron saw very clearly how 
the game was certain to go, perhaps 
had gone already. But one desperate 
gamble was still open to him, and 
he took it. 

“Your little surprise?” Vincento’s 
words became low and measured, 
while his brows knit as if presag- 
ing thunder. “Then it was you who 
sent that rascally friar to me in 
the night?” 

Derron let the question of the 
friar pass. “It was I who arranged 



— this.” He gestured with proprie- 
tary pride at the pendulum, and m a 
few words he sketched the outline of 
a huge lie. How he had really been 
here a day before the other refu^ 
gees, with friends to help him (this 
lie would not stand investigation, 
but if Derron’s plan succeeded, Vin- 
cento would never want to investi- 
gate) install the pendulum — while 
in his mind Derron visualized the 
berserker here, catlike, monkeylike, 
devilish, arranging mounting and 
cable and weight in order that: “. 
you see before you, Messire Vincen- 
to, a firm proof of the rotation of 
the globe!” 

There was a start in the old eyes, 
but no real surprise; a desperate 
gamble had been justified, all right. 
Now Vincento had become a waiting 
statue, mouth twisted and eyes un- 
blinking. 

Derron went on: “Of course I 
have followed your example, distin- 
guished sir, and that of a number of 
our contemporaries, in protecting 
my rightful claim to this discovery 
while keeping it secret yet a while, 
for my own advantage in further 
research. To this end have I sent 
anagram messages encoding the truth 
to distinguished persons in several 
parts of the world. 

“Though as I say, sir, I had meant 
to reserve the secret yet a while, I 
cannot stand idly by during your 
present difficulties.” 

“A proof of our Robe’s rotation, 
you say.” The tone was blank, sus- 
pended. 

“Ah, forgive me for not exiplain- 
ing! I had hot thought it necessary 
— you see, the plane of the pendu- 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



37 




I'um does not rotate, k is our globe 
that rotates beneath it.” Derron 
hesitated, as if it had just occurred 
to him that Vincento might be get- 
ting just a little slow and senile. 
Then he spoke on, more slowly and 
distinctly. “At the poles, this de- 
vice will trace daily a full circle of 
three hundred and sixty degrees. 
At the equator it will appear not 
to rotate at all.” Mercilessly he 
poured out in detail his three-and-a- 
half -centuries’ advantage of accumu- 
lated knowledge. “Between these ex- 
tremes the rate of rotation is pro- 
portional to the latitude; here, it is 
about ten* degrees per hour. And 
since we are in the northern hemis- 
phere the direction of apparent ro- 
tation is clockwise . .” 

W ill was shouting at his master 
from high above: “. she be 
mounted free to turn any way, but 
there be nothing turning her!” 
Vincento shouted up: “Come 

down!” 

“. bit more study if ’ee wants 
a sketch . .” 

“Come down!” The thick lips spat 
it out. 

Derron kept the pressure on, 
switching his emphasis now to re- 
morseless generosity. “. my only 
wish of course now being to help 
you, sir, to come to your rescue. 
In bygone years you have accom- 
plished very substantial things, very 
substantial, and you must not now 
be cast aside. My lance is at your 
disposal; I will gliadly repeat this 
demonstration of my discovery for 
the authorities in -the Holy City, so 
that the world may witness — ” 



“Enough! I have no need of 
helpr Vincento’s tone made -the 
last word an obscenity. “You will 
not — meddle — in — my — af- 
fairs. Not in the least degree!” 

Before Vincento’s terrible con- 
tempt and wrath, Derron found him- 
self physically retreating, even as he 
realized that he had won his gam- 
ble — his wager that the old man’s 
pride was as monumental as his 
genius. 

Derron stood in silence as Vin- 
cento, shrinking once more under 
his bufdens of age and weariness 
and fear, turned away with a part- 
ing look of hatred. Vincento would 
never use -the Foucault proof; he 
would never believe it. It was one 
direction in which he would never- 
more want to investigate; he would 
force the whole thing from his mind 
if he could. The smallness and 
jealousy that were leading him to 
trial and humiliation existed not 
only in other men, but in himself. 

Derron knew that Vincento at his 
historical trial would not only re- 
cant, he would go beyond what his 
judges asked or want^ of him and 
offer to wriite a new pamphlet, 
proving that the sun did after all 
move around the world of men. 

My only wish -being to help you, 
sir. Vincento’s figure dwindled to the 
end of the nave, and at last the 
door boomed shut behind him. 

Now even Vincento could -be for- 
gotten for the moment, for real vic- 
tory and hope were heady things. 
Getting away ahead of Will’s ques- 
tions, Derron hurried out of the 
cathedral by a side door and 
skipped down the steep stairs toward 



38 



IF 




the monastery. If the 'berserker had 
not also smashed the backup com- 
municator hidden in his staff, he 
could tell the Modern world of vic- 
tory. 

The enemy had not bothered 
with anything in his cell. As he 
came near it, an emergency sum- 
mons from Operations began to 
throb in the bone behind his ear. 

B rother Saile was puffing, though 
he was making no effort to 
hurry along the narrow cattle-path 
that wound up and down hill 
through scrubby bushes and thin 
woods. Instead he hung back and 
with almost every puff of breath 
tried to discourage Brother Jovann’s 
progress. “I thought — to say a 
few prayers in the village — would 
have been sufficient. These peas- 
ants, as you know — are often fool- 
ish. They may have — greatly exag- 
gerated — the depredations of this 
supposed wolf.” 

“Then my own peasant foolish- 
ness is not likely to cause any harm,” 
said Jovann, leading on implacably. 
They were deep in the wolfs sup- 
posed domain; their peasant sup- 
plicants and guides had turned back 
through fear a quarter of a mile 
earlier. 

“I spoke too harshly of them, may 
the Holy One forgive me.” Saile 
wheezed to the top of a hilf and 
gathered breath for readier speech 
on the descent. “Now if this one 
beast has really caused in a few 
days all the death and damage they 
claim for it, or even half so much, 
it would be utter folly for us to ap- 
proach it unarmed as we are. It is 



not that I doubt for an instant the 
inscrutable wisdom of Providence 
which can cause a fish to leap for 
joy after you have released it, noc 
do I doubt the story I once heard 
of the gentle little birds listening 
to your preaching. But a wolf, any 
wolf, is quite another . .” 

Brother Jovann did not appear 
to be listening very closely. He had 
paused briefly to follow with his 
eyes a train of scavenger-insects 
which crossed the path and vanished 
into the brush. Then he went on, 
more slowly, until a similar train 
appeared a little further along the 
trail. There Brother Jovann turned, 
walking noisily into the brush, lead- 
ing his companion toward the spot 
where it seemed the two lines of 
insects must intersect. 

IX 

S taff in hand, Derron made the 
best cross-country time he 
could, running fifty steps and walk- 
ing fifty. 

“Odegard!” Operations had cried 
out. “There’s another lifeline just 
as vital as Vincento’s there with 
you. Or he was with you. Now he 
and one of the others have moved 
out a couple of miles. They’re about 
to leave the safety zone. You’ll have 
to protect them. They’ll be at the 
berserker’s mercy if it’s out there 
waiting.” 

And of course it would be out 
there, in ambush or pursuit. The at- 
tack on Vincento had been in deadly 
earnest, like the first punch in a 
good one-two. But it was the sec- 
ond punch that was really intended 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



39 




as the killer. And humanity had 
left itself wide open. 

Running fifty, walking fifty, Der- 
ron covered ground steadily along 
the (bearing Operations had given 
him. He asked: “Just who am I 
looking for?” 

And when they told him, he 
thought he should have guessed the 
name, should have been 'alerted by 
his first look into that gentle and 
loving face. 

I n the midst of the thicket there 
had been havoc. Days ago it had 
happened, for the tree branches that 
had been broken were now dead. 
And though insects were still busy 
among the wreckage of bone and 
gray fur on the ground, there was 
no 'longer much left for them to 
scavenge. 

“This was a very big wolf,” said 
Brother Jovann, bending to pick 
up a piece of jawbone. The tone 
had been shattered by some violent 
blow, but this fragment still contain- 
ed teeth of impressive size. 

“Very big, certainly,” said Brother 
Saile, though he knew very little 
about wolves. He did not care to 
learn more and kept looking around 
him nervously. 

Jovann was musing aloud. “Now, 
what manner of creature can it be 
that deals thus with a big male 
wolf? Even as I in my greed have 
sometimes dealt with the tones of 
a 'little roast fowl . but no, these 
bones 'have not been gnawed for 
nourishment. Only broken and 
broken again, as if by some creature 
who is even more wantonly savage 
than a wolf.” 



T he name of Brother Jovann, 
saint, symbol of gentleness and 
love meant something to Modern 
skeptics as well as 'believers, to both 
historians and laymen. Like Vincen- 
to, he had become a towering folk- 
figure, imperfectly understood. 

“We’re just catching on to 
Joviann’s practical importance,” said 
Time Ops’ voice in Derrcn’s head. 
“Historically his lifeline goes on 
about fifteen years from your point, 
and all along the way it radiates 
support to other Knes. What has 
been described as ‘good-turn-a-day 
stuff.’ These other lines tend to re- 
radiate life support in turn, and 
the process propagates up through 
history. Our best judgment now is 
that the disarmament treaty three 
hundred years after Jovann’s death 
will fall through and an international 
nuclear war will wipe us all out in 
pre-Modern times if St. Jovann is 
terminated at your point.” 

A girl’s voice came in briskly: 
“A new report for Colonel Ode- 
gard.” 

Derron asked: “Lisa?” 

She hesitated for just an instant; 
then, business first. “Colonel — the 
lifeline that was described to you 
earlier as having an embryonic ap- 
pearance is moving out of the safety 
z5one after the other two, at what 
seems an unaccountably high speed. 
We can give no explanation. You’re 
to bear five degrees left, also.” -J. 

“Understand.” Derron tore five 
degrees left, as near as he could 
judge. “Lisa?” 

“Derron, they put me on because 
I said I’d tend strictly to business.” 
“You do that.” He began to run 



40 



IF 




once more, his breath coming in 
gasps. ‘1 just wish — you were 
carrying my baby.” 

There was a faint, completely fe- 
minine sound. But when Lisa’s 
voice came back intelligibly it was 
all business again, with more bear- 
ings to be given. 

F rom the corner of his eye 
Brother Saile caught the move- 
ment of something coming toward 
them through the trees and bush; 
he turned, squinting under the after- 
noon sun, and with surprise at his 
own relative calm he saw that their 
search for a killer wolf had come 
to an end. Monster instead of wolf, 
I>erhaps, but he could not doubt it 
was the killer, come now to find 
the searchers. 

Silent, poisonous and deadly- 
looking as a silver wasp, the man- 
sized creature came at a catlike run 
through the scrub forest. Brother 
Saile understood that he should now 
try to lay down his life for his 
friend, he should shove Brother 
Jovann back and rush forward him- 
self to distract the thing. And some- 
thing in Brother Saile wanted to be 
that heroic, but his belly and his 
feet had turned to lead and would 
not let him. He tried at least to 
shout a warning, but even his throat 
was paralyzed by fear. At last he' 
did manage to seize Brother Jovann 
by the arm and point. 

“Ah,” said Jovann, coming out 
of a reverie and turning to see. A 
score of paces away the monster 
crouched on its four legs. Peasants 
glimpsing it might call it wolf. 
Shreds of gray cloth clung to it, as 



if it had been dressed and then had 
wolf-like torn itself out of the gar- 
ment. Terrible and beauitifuil at once, 
it flowed like quicksilver two rapid 
strides closer to the men and then 
settled again into a crouching, silent 
statue. 

“In God’s n-name come away!” 
Brother SaUe whispered, through 
shivering jaws. “It is no natural 
beast. Come away. Brother Jovann!” 

But Jovann only raised his hands 
and signed 'the horror with the 
wedge; he seemed to be blessing it 
rather than exorcising. 

“Brother Wolf,” he said lovingly, 
“you do indeed look unlike any 
beast I have ever seen before, and 
I know not from what worldly 
parentage you may have sprung. 
But there is in you the spirit of 
life; therefore never forget that our 
Father above has created you, as He 
has created ah other creatures, ac- 
cording to his own plan, so we are 
all children of the one Father.” 

The wolf darted forward and 
stopped, stepped and stopped, inched 
and stopped again, in a fading oscil- 
lation. In its open mouth Saile 
thought he saw fangs not only long 
and sharp, but blurring with vicious 
motion like the teeth of some in- 
credible saw. At last there came 
forth a sound, and Saile was re- 
minded simultaneously of ringing 
swordblades and of human agony. 

Jovann dropped to one knee, fac- 
ing the monster more on a level. He 
spread his arms as if willing an 
embrace. The thing bounded in a 
blur of speed toward ihkn, then 
stopped as if caught by a leash. It 
was still six or eight paces from the 



BROTHER BERSERKER 



41 




kneeling man. Again it uttered 
sound; Saile, half -fainting, seemed to 
hear the creak of the torture rack 
and the cry of the victim rise to- 
gether. 

Jovann’s voice had nothing to do 
with fear, but only blended stern- 
ness with its love. 

“Brother Wolf, you have killed 
and pillaged hke a wanton crimi- 
-nal, and for that you deserve punish- 
ment! But accept instead the for- 
giveness of all ithe men you have 
wronged. Come now, here is my 
hand. In the name of the Hdy 
One, come to me and pledge that 
from this day on you live in peace 
with men. Come!”

A s Derron came up at a staggering, 
exhauted run, he first heard a 
murmur of speech and then saw the 
figure of Brother Saile standing mo- 
tiontess. 

Derron then lurched to a halt, 
raising his staff; but Saile was not 
looking at him, and Derron knew 
now that Saile was not the berserker. 
What Operations had said about the 
embryonic lifeline and what the ber- 
serker had said in the cathedral had 
at last fitted together to make a 
wondrous kind of sense. Three steps 
sideways brought Derron to where 
he could see what Saile was gaping 
at. 

He was only in time to see the 
berserker-wolf take the last hesitant 
step of its advance. To see it raise 
one metal paw — and with its steel 
claw-fingers gently touch the kneel- 
ing friar’s extended hand. 



64Qo, my guess was right, it had 
O become a living thing,” said 
Derron. His head rested in lisa’s 
lap, and he looked up past her face 
at the park’s treetops and imitation 
sun. “And as such, susceptible to 
St. Jovann’s domination. To his love. 
There’s no other way to put it.” 
Lisa stroked his forehead. “Are 
you eating up the pious legends?” 
“Oh, there are rational explana- 
tions. The most complex and com- 
pact machine the terser kers ever 
built, shot up through twenty thou- 
sand years evoluntionary gradient — 
something like life was bound to 
happen to it. Or so we say now. And 
Jovann and some other men have had 
amazing power over living things.” 
“I looked up this particular pious 
legend,” said Lisa. “It says that 
after being tamed by St. Jovann, 
it lived like a pet dog in the village.” 
“That would have been the orig- 
inal wolf. I suppose the berserker 
meant all along to kill the animal 
and take its place during the taming 
episode. But tearing the real wolf 
into little bits was an irrational, 
thing to do — if we’d known about 
that sooner we might have guessed. 
I might have guessed in the 
cathedral, when it babbled to me 
about passages between life and not- 
life. Or when it came to my cell in 
the night, for no reason valid to a 
machine. Anyway, Operations isn’t 
as trusting as Jovann and his bio- 
graphers. We’ve got the thing in a 
cage in present-time while the sci- 
enitisits try to decide . .” 

Derron had to pause, for a young 
lady was bending over him with the 
intention of being kissed. END

It was just a little problem 
of misrouted mail — too bad 
it was destroying the galaxy!

K lonit-41-Z-Bih slithered v^tly 
(from his ofifice out onto the 
steel-decked veranda, contracting the 
laifter part of his long body so his 
last few legs could squeeze out. He 
cpiled himself into a spiral, letting 
'his soaiey chin rest on the railing 
while his slitted, amber eyes rov- 
ed boredly over his domain. A pair 
of plinch birds — four-winged, four- 
legged, pink-(feathered — sailed 
around the building, saw him, slow- 
ed a little and fluted in unison: 
“Good morning, Director.” 

“Mominig,” he rumbled, keeping 
his voice down so he wouldn’t tur- 
bulate the air around him. “Some- 
thing up?” 

“No, Director. Just taking lunches 



to a couple of blens,** One of the 
birds hefted the carton in its talons. 

“Oh,” Klonit sighed. That was the 
hell of it. Galkbar wasn’t too bad, 
for an uninhabited, remote planet — 
though at times he’d give a foozlunk 
of his salary for a bake under the 
huge orange sun of his home world 
— but nothing ever happened. It 
had been over a year since anyone 
even appeared to claim mail in per- 
son. Just stasis-parcels warping in, 
warping out or being held in storage; 
routine reports, things his Central 
Computer and the various work- 
robots could have handled without 
supervision. The only reason he had 
any live personnel at all was that 
certain races who were members of 
the Sector Customs And Mail Union 
had prejudices against robots.

Seveiral of his toe-daiws scratched 
idly at joints between his body- 
scaJes, while others taipped a bored 
little rhythm on the steel decking. 
He watched the two plinch birds 
pause in flight for a moment to 
tease one of the planet’s huge green- 
and-yellow butterflies, then continue^ 
on toward Sundry Warehouse No. 
Six, one of the few buildings above 
ground. A pair of blens — muscular, 
brown, hairless bipeds, apparently 
quite conufortable nude in Galk- 
bar’s coolish lavender sunlight — 
stepped into sight from behind 
Warehouse Six, where the pens were 
that held Live Unclaimed Mail. The 
plinch birds fluttered down toward 
them. 

H opefully, Klonit filled his fore- 
body with air and let his full 
voice roll out. “Ho, you blens\ Any- 
thing up?” 

The brown bipeds jumiped as the 
blast of sound hit them. Their voices 
came from the communication-box 
Klonit wore at his throat. “N-no, 
Director. Just inventorying the Live 
Mail again. There’s a new litter, 
just bom, of those big-eared things.” 
Klonit growled. He knew for a 
certainty that much of the Live Mail 
being held would never be claimed. 
What he’d like to do was turn it 
loose on the rising brush-covered 
slope, whence came the smells of 
ripening berries and small indigenous 
animal life. But regulations said it 
had to be held three years. 

A sigh rippled back along his 
body. He supposed he ought to or- 
der lunch and get it over with. He 
didn’t really know, though, what he 



wanted to eat, nor what he’d do with 
the afternoon. 

S ome thousands of light-years from 
Galkbar, Barth’s first manned 
ship to Itfars settled slowly toward 
the floor of a crater. The skipper. 
Colonel Jason Glook, sat at the con- 
trol console, peering at meters and 
viewscreens and making little mo- 
tions of his fingers over various 
studs. Actually, the ship was landing 
herself, and he was only trying to 
look busy. In his mind he was going 
over the speech he’d soon tape for 
radioing, when possible, to Earth. 

He was a rather large man, well 
muscled, slightly gray at the tem- 
ples. His tailored uniform was as 
neat as his small moustache. The 
tight curl of his hair, and the fullness 
of his lips, hinted at possible Negro 
blood, though his irises were agate- 
gray. His skin, with its careful tan, 
coiild be Caucasian. Something 
about the shape of his eyes, though, 
suggested an Oriental admixture; or 
ipossibly Semitic. Or, he could be an 
American Indian. 

Major Sarah Tolberg, dainty and 
feminine, stood a few steps back 
of him, her dark eyes, a little wide 
with excitement, fixed on the view- 
screens. Beside her stood Lieutenant 
David Lobell. His boyish blue eyes 
and blond good looks contrasted 
piquantly with her dark beauty. He 
squeezed back and, to hide his con- 
fusion, said, “Uh, Colonel, that dust 
storm’s beginning to spill over the 
rim of the crater.” 

“All right. Lieutenant.” Glock 
kept his voice languid, even as he 
shot an unobtrusive glance at a

IF 




viewscreen. The sandstorm couldn’t 
really harm the ship, of course, but 
it might sandblast off the name and 
other lettering on the outside, which 
were only painted on. He did have 
his heart set on a photograph of 
himself in a spacesuit with the just- 
landed ship as a background. Ner- 
vously, he twisted dials to swivel an 
outside telescope. “Maybe we can 
find shelter. That looks like a cave 
in the crater wall. Let’s hop over 
and have a look, eh?” He sent the 
ship skimming in that direction. 
“Quite solid rock over it, wouldn’t 
you say?” 

David Lobel said a trifle wistfully, 
“Looks almost artificial, doesn’t it, 
sir?” 

G lock gave Sarah Tolberg his 
smile-f or-J unior-Off icers-female, 
tfien turned a more condescending 
one on David. “Always the roman- 
tic, eh. Lieutenant? No; your grand- 
father could speculate about Mar- 
dans; but now we know better. Life- 
less world and always has been. Con- 
ditions absolutely wrong, you know. 
And as for anything coming from 
beyond the Sol^ System . well 
...” He shrugged to show how 
ridiculous that was. “Here we go 
in. Man that forward spotlight, will 
you. Lieutenant? Raise k a little, 
toward the ceiling. Right. Solid rock. 
Mm. We’ll ease in here where it 
narrows, nice and snug. Now we’ll 
put her down, gently . so.” 

He raised his head and beamed 
at the two of them. For an instant 
he felt a twinge of masculine re- 
sentment that Sarah stood so dose 
to David, but it passed quickly. 



There were plenty of women, and 
anyway they were really (though one 
wouldn’t say so, in public) more 
trouble than they were worth. Be- 
sides, with the pair of them so 
wrapped up in each other, they 
wouldn’t be competing with him for 
the limelight, once the ship got 
back to Barth. “Well. Here we are! 
Lieutenant, you may os well be- 
gin getting the suits in order. And, 
Major — perhaps, that bottle of 
wine we’ve been saving, eh?” He 
smiled brightly. 

At that moment his face went 
absolutely motionless, frozen in the 
smile. So did everything else in 
the ship. The drift of electrons, in 
wires, stopped. The molecules of the 
air halted their wild rebounding. 
The three occupants of the ship 
could not know of the sudden in- 
terruption, for it was a complete 
Time Stasis. When it was released, 
every molecule, every body cell, 
every thought, would resume as 
instantly as it bad halted. But, for 
now, nothing within the ship, not 
even Time, moved. The ship itself, 
though, and the capsule of strange 
forces that surrounded it moved, 
in an instant, some thousands of 
light-years.

K lonit toyed listlessly with his 
dessert of candied matl paws. 
He lifted a morsel toward his eating- 
parts, then let it stop in mid-air as 
a ‘ping’ came from the corn-box at 
his throat. “Yes?” Klonit listens.” 
“Ah, ahem.” Central Computer’s 
voice, with a few lifelike flaws built

into it, might have belon'ged to a 
blen or to any of a hundred other 
vocalizing species. “I tihought I’d 
better tell you, Director, that we’re 
going to be visited by two battle- 
fleets within the next three hours. 
The Selidae and the Medanjians.” 

Kllonit’s eating-utensil fell with a 
clatter as a shriek exploded from 
him. His long body reared up. Half a 
dozen legs swept across the desk, 
knocking plates from it, as one claw 
jabbed frantically at a large red 
button. “Mayday! Mayday!” he bel- 
lowed. “All personnel to the shel- 
ters! Man the evacuation capsules! 
Check all power sources and emer- 
gency supplies; test air-regenerating 
machinery! Transfer all mail possi- 
ble to the Outposts! Central, acti- 
vate my Maximum Security Quar- 
ters! ni be down in a couple of — 
as soon as I take care of those con- 
fidential files — ” In 'his wild dart- 
ing about, he got ihimself wound 
around the desk so that his own 
forward legs scrabbled over his tail- 
part. He let loose a rattling series 
of oaths. “Great Oopulating No- 
vae!” 

“Director,” Central Computer said 
calmly, “I’ve already taken care of 
everything. Will you let me report 
the situation?” 

“Aaargh!” Klonit struggled to un- 
tangle himself; kicked haphazardly at 
■the plates strewn on the floor. 
“Three hours, you say? Get some- 
one or something up here to clean 
up this mess!” He snorted a couple 
of times and felt calmer. “All right. 
What’s up?” 

“Well, Director, it didn’t seem 
anything to ibother you about. A 

48 



stasis-capsule arrived, bearing three 
live creatures in an unfamiliar kind 
of package. There was no addressee 
and no returnee,^ so I sent out routine 
queries to the two catalogued space 
societies in the sector of the cap- 
sule’s origin. Those were the Selidae 
and the Medanjians. Neither was 
within fifty light-years of the origin, 
so it’s probable there was some mal- 
function in the mailing. However, 
there’s nobody else even reasonably 
close. But now both races have 
claimed the parcel.” 

Klonit blinked, his chitinous eye- 
lids, making an almost metallic 
sound. “They have? Uh, did you 
describe the parcel’s contents?” 

“No more and no less than pre- 
scribed by regulations. Director. A 
package, arriving by Translocation, 
containing three bipeds, advanced 
enough to wear clothing and pre- 
pare their own meals from foods 
stocked in the package.” 

K lonit scratched irritably at his 
chin. “Now, why in . Cen- 
tral, did you inform each that the 
other was also being queried?” 

“Of course. Regulations — ” 
“Idiot! Don’t you know how they 
hate each other?” 

“I’m aware of that.” 

“Well, for hydrogen’s sake! Didn’t 
you foresee what would happen? Of 
course they’d both claim it! Which- 
ever one it doesn't belong to — if 
it belongs to either — will hope to 
steal some bit of new technology 
or learn about some new species 
the other’s enslaved; don’t you see? 
They both raise food animals, don’t 
you know?” 



IF 




“Answering in order: no, yes and 
yes.” 

Klonit snarled. “Well, one more 
question. Exactly where did the 
capsule come from?” 

“Point of origin. Delta five nine 
two log one seven five four, Upsilon 
two six eight log three zero one, 
Zeta one zero four log nine seven 
two. Click.” 

“Hey! Pm not through with you!” 
“Oh? You said one more ques- 
tion. I answered it and turned my 
voice-circuit off.” 

“Well, damn it, this is a com- 
plex question, with several parts. I 
don’t remember any Translocator 
Station in that spot! It’s out beyond 
either the Selidae or the Medan- 
jians!” 

“Correct. The race that maintain- 
ed an outpost there has not been 
heard from for several thousaed 
of your lifetimes, and it is probably 
extinct. However — ” 

“However, plinch droppings!” 
Klonit roared. “If the Station’s still 
operative, why haven’t you sent a 
drone to investigate?” 

“I have. Director. The planet is 
desolate, very low in atmosphere 
and without artifacts other than the 
Station. That is inside a natural cave, 
well disguised, well protected and 
operated on automatics. There is 
no sign whether some other race has 
just discovered it and placed this 
parcel in it, or whether the parcel 
has been there for ages, with a 
planetquake or something just now 
jarring the machinery into opera- 
tion. The data — ” 

“Stuff the data in your memory 
banks. Send a platform to bring me 



down to wherever you’ve put tbe 
parcel. I definitely want to take a 
look at it.” 

T here were peep instruments, ©f 
course; but Klonit decided also 
to relax the Time Stasis briefly to 
observe the three bipeds in action. 
They’d never know the difference. 
He 'watched them for a few mo- 
ments, then quickly restored the 
Stasis. “Central! You complete boob! 
Can’t you see these are civilized be- 
ings? Look how the young female 
and male are holding hands! Doesn’t 
that rouse any feeling in you? Are 
you proposing to turn them over 
to barbarians like the Selidae or 
the Medanjians? And this — this 
thing you call a package. Can’t you 
see it’s a ship — their ship? Primi- 
tive, but a ship; suitable for voyag- 
ing within a planetary system. An- 
swer me!” 

“A ship, after all, is a package, 
Director.” 

“Arrgh! Huh. Well, when are 
those battle fleets due? Which one 
first?” 

“The Selidan. ETA, mark, two 
point eight six three hours from 
now.” 

“All right. Ready me a survey- 
capsule. I want to see this “deso- 
late” planet you describe. I’ll be 
back within two hours. Meanwhile, 

I want you to send a resume of this 
whole mess to the Chief Of Coun- 
cil. Ask him if any members have 
fleets close enough to get here 
ahead of the Selidae.” 

“I’ve already done that. Director. 
There should be a reply before you 
get back.”

T he abandoned station was pret- 
ty much as Klonit expected, 
marvelous only in that it had re- 
mained in working order so long. 
He eased his capsule out of the 
cave, sensors probing ahead for dan- 
ger. The sandstorm, he wrote off; 
but, because it interfered with vis- 
ion, moved clear of it. A quick look 
around told him this planet was 
too far out from its sun and un- 
suitable in other ways to be the 
home world of the three bipeds. 

Maybe the next one in. Yes. 
There it was, to one side of the sun; 
an aired, blue-scatter world of about 
the right temperature and mass. He 
listened to the jumble of static and 
communication on its radio bands. 
Highly industrialized. The Selidae 
and the Medan] ians would certain- 
ly consider it a rich plum. 

Now, if he could get fairly close 
without being detected. He used the 
planet’s single moon for cover, 
avoiding various artifacts, and took 
up a position. Radar would see him, 
hut he wasn’t staying long, and 
probably they’d write him off as 
some bit of debris or a malfunction. 

From the ship he’d examined on 
Galkbar, he had grasped the tech- 
nology of their television. He tuned 
about the channels, found himself 
watching a play-drama in which 
several of the bipeds — male — 
with masks over their faces walked 
into a wooden building and pointed 
hand-weapons at other bipeds in- 
side. There was some talk and some 
facial miming, then bipeds behind 
partitions with grill-protected win- 
dows began scooping small silvery 
discs from drawers and from a big 



thick-metal box, into little fabric 
bags. 

One biped behind the partition 
stealthily drew from concealment a 
hand-weapon of his own. One of 
the masked bipeds saw him, and 
the latter’s hand-weapon jumped 
a little, with a terrible bang and 
an eruption of smoke. The biped 
behind the partition collapsed, 
clutching at his chest. Now the 
masked bipeds grabbed the fabric 
bags and ran from the building. 

Just outside were some larger 
creatures, quadruped and rather 
splendid looking. Each of the mask- 
ed bipeds seized a quadruped, heav- 
ed himself up and bestraddled it. 
Klonit gaped. Then the quadrupeds 
were galloping loudly down the 
street, raising clouds of dust, bear- 
ing the masked bipeds away. Other 
bipeds came running from wooden 
buildings, with hand weapons and 
with longfcr weapons which they 
steadied against their shoulders, to 
shoot after the fleeing mounted bi- 
peds. Male bipeds were shouting, 
and females were screaming, and 
the weapons made an awful din, 
and there was an absolute bedlam 
of dashing about. 

Klonit found himself crouched, 
tense, his claws scrabbling at the 
deck. In sudden irritation, he darted 
a leg out to turn off the drama, 
then relaxed determinedly, to calm 
himself. Presently be growled and 
reached out for control-studs. A 
person could forget the time, watch- 
ing such childish entertainment. 

L ess than two hours later, back 
on Galkbar, he emerged from 



50 



IF 




the survey capsule and stared 
round him. “Central! Why am I 
confined here in my Maximum Se- 
curity Quarters?” 

“Because, Director, the Selidae 
arrived ahead of time. Their fleet’s 
in orbit right now.” 

Klonit reared up and glared at 
the ceiling. “I should have known 
they’d lie about their arrival and 
sneak in sooner! Did you find any 
Member fleets?” 

“No, Director. And you’d better 
talk to Admiral Feyooch, who’s still 
the Selidan commander. He’s 
threatening to annihilate us. But 
first, there are three messages from 
our Chief Of Council.” 

“Huh? Oh. Well, all right; let’s 
have them!” 

“First. Utmost confidential. Klon- 
it, the military, political and tech- 
nological situation makes it imper- 
ative you avoid antagonizing the 
Selidae or the Medanjian$ at this 
time. Give them whatever they de- 
mand. If necessary, evacuate Galk- 
<har and all the mail you can and 
let them have the place. Second 
— Director, I 'believe this second 
message^as sent in a different con- 
text — Utmost confidential. All Sta- 
tion Directors. Interstellar situation 
demands our outlying Centers car- 
ry on at this time with no hint of 
unusual activity. An air of com- 
plete ordinariness must be preserv- 
ed. No unusual leaves are to be 
granted; nor is there to be any un- 
usual efflux of mail. Third — 

A sound like a gulp, amplified a 
hundred times, came from Klonit. 
“Hold on a minute! Did I hear you 
right?” 



“I imagine you did. Director. Wait 
until you hear the third. All Station 
Directors. There has been too much 
laxity lately in the matter of mis- 
directed mail. Too many parcels 
have been yielded to the wrong 
claimants. Steps must be taken to 
halt this laxity. Mail is not to be 
yielded to claimants without thor- 
ough proof of ownership. Be firm. 
Signed, Chief of Council.” 

“Gaaak!” Klonit got seven or 
eight legs under the edge of his 
desk, preparatory to overturning it. 

Central said, “It may be better if 
your office is not mussed up. Direc- 
tor. I can’t stall off Feyooch much 
longer.” 

“Feyooch! Tell him to — uh, no; 
I guess not. Better put him on be- 
fore he atomizes us!” 

A viewscreen crackled and glowed 
to life. The picture showed a 
huge, thick-mandibled arthropod. 
The pincers, which were awesome 
enough in themselves, even to Klon- 
it, had energy-weapons riveted to 
them. Klonit said weakly, “Fey-Fey- 
ooch?” 

First one, then the other, of the 
buttonlike eyes cocked at him. 
“Klonit? Of course it’s me! Why do 
you ask? Who else would it be? 
What are you implying? Have you 
heard something?” 

“No, no. Admiral! It’s just that, 
uh, it’s been four years. I — I’m 
glad to see you looking so well.” 
“Humph. Klonit, It’s a good 
thing you’re back from whatever 
fool’s errand you were on. I was 
about to come down and get that 
parcel of mine. Send it up here at

once, and we’ll say no more about 
your illegal and highly impudent 
possession of it.” 

“Uh . Klonit tried not to 
squirm. “Er, as a matter of fact. 
Admiral, it isn’t, uh, here.” Noting 
the signs of rage, he lied on hur- 
riedly. “There, uh, seemed to be, 
er, some sort of stasis-inerter field 
around it that we aren’t familiar 
with. The best we could dv^ was to 
get it to an outpost.” 

Feyooch fixed him with an un- 
certain glance. “Stasis-inerter field? 
Oh. Uh, that. Yes, I suppose your 
miserable technology would find it 
hard to, uh, cope with. Just give 
me the location, then, and I’ll . .” 
Klonit, his eyes darting about the 
background of the picture, which 
seemed to be full of weapons-con- 
trols, said, “It’s, er,” and rattled 
off the co-ordinates of an unoccu- 
pied outpost. If he could just get 
rid of the Selidae before the Medan- 
jians got here . .” 

But it wasn’t going to work. Fey- 
oodh stared at him beadily. “Klon- 
it, you’re a miserably incompetent 
liar. Send that parcel up right now, 
and no more nonsense! You don’t 
want to be slagged, Klonit, now do 
you?” 

“No, no. Admiral, certainly not! 
I swear there’s nothing I want more 
than to see this parcel delivered to 
its rightful owner! I mean — uh — ” 
He went silent, mouthparts work- 
ing, as a second screen lit up. “Cen- 
tral! What — ” 

“Admiral Vinitassin, Director. He 
begs you to talk to him at once, 
so he won’t have to launch his 
missiles.” 



T he Medanjian looked like S rosy, 
soft-shelled egg with a firmge 
of arms around the top and four 
short legs at the bottom. The head 
w'as a mere excresence. But the eyes 
were clear and intelligent — round 
and innocently blue — and the rose 
bud mouth smiled beatifioally. 

“Oh, there you are, Klonit. I’ni 
so happy your computer was ab’ 
to find you. And it’s delightful to 
see you looking so well; I swear Tve 
never seen your scales shinier. I ob- 
serve that you have a deplorable 
.infestation of vermin around your 
planet. I’d be delighted to eradi- 
cate it for you, but I fear it would 
be impossible without crisping the 
planet as well. Oh; and if you’re 
expecting anyone via nornial space, 
warn them, will you? I have the 
area rather thickly mined.” 

A sound like a rusty hacksaw rip- 
ping tin cans came from Feyooch. 
“Klonit, you tell that hors-d’oeuvre 
the smallest of my landing^boats 
could sweep all his mines out of 
the way and wipe out his fleet at 
the same time! And I warn you 
again — ” 

Vinitassin broke in sweetly, “What 
debasements you permit yourself 
to endure, Klonit! Why don’t you 
let one of your janitors handle such 
interviews? Meanwhile, I don’t want 
to be rude, but I really must have 
that lost parcel of mine. A trifling 
thing — not nearly worth your at- 
tention, really — but you know how

exception. So if you’ll just tell me,

“Klonit!” Feyooch shrieked, “If

Klonit swelled up to bellow but 
instead, thinking of the massed hos- 
tile weaponry around Galkbar at the 
moment, produced instead a thin 
squeal. 

“'Uh, gentlemen ... I wonder if 
you’d excuse me for just the short- 
est moment? Urgent Special De- 
livery coming in. I’ll be right — ” 
He let out a long sigh of relief as 
Central blanked out both screens. 
“Thanks! If I can just iget a minute 
to think.” He ran around the edges 
of the room, his ibody almost form- 
ing a square. “Damn it . Send 
another message to all Members — ” 
“I’m sending resumes every min- 
ute, Director. There are no Mem- 
ber fleets within several hours. Any- 
way, we couldn’t survive a battle 
nearby, you know.” 

K lonit collapsed in a groaning 
heap. “I know, I know! What’s 
Feyooch doing?” 

“He’s forming a spearhead to 
come down. He says he’ll wait ten 
minutes. Not one second more.” 
“Oh! Oh! And Vinitassin?” 

“He seems to be leaking to us 
a part of his orders to his fleet. It 
involves battle tactics. Apparently, 
Director, he’s given up hope of get- 
ting the parcel, if you don’t warp 
it out to him. It seems he intends 
just to fire all his missiles in and 
vaporize Galkbar, the Selidan fleet 
and everything. Director, you’re 
simply temporizing, you know.” 
“Damn it! Of course I’m tempor- 



izing! I’ve got to — you got us 
into this! Start racking your cir- 
cuits, too! How much time — God; 
less than seven minutes! Look, send 
a message to Vinitassin. Give him 
the co-ordinates of that empty out- 
post and say we’U warp his parcel 
there. Apologize that I’m not able 
to tell him so myself just now. And 
tell Feyooch that, uh, his parcel will 
be coming up through the atmos- 
phere on gravs in a few minutes. 
Say I’m sorry I’m too busy to 
talk to him. Say I was wrong about 
the parcel being somewhere else; I 
had it confused with a different one. 
And don*t get the two messages 
mixed up!” 

“I have that much sense, Director. 
If I may ask — ” 

“Send the messages!” 

“I have. I’m not confined to one 
set of circuits, you know. If I may 
ask. Director, how many minutes 
do you hope to gain by this tem- 
porizing? I really can’t understand 
the sense of prolonging things, since 
we’re going to perish in a few min- 
utes anyway. I should think — ” 

Klonit lifted his forebody and 
shrieked, “You’ire damned right you 
should thinki In fact, I order you 
to think! You created this problem! 
Solve it! You’re always bragging 
about how many circuits you have!” 
He ran out of breath and slumped 
to the floor. It wasn’t any use, he 
knew, shoulthig at Central. The Com- 
puter didn’t care; and it couldn’t 
work miracles, anyway. He wonder- 
ed if he ought to inform his person- 
nel of their imminent doom. No, 
there wasn’t time to evacuate them, 
so it was probably best to leave

them in ignorance. Let die end 
come to them quickly and merci- 
fully. 

M inutes dragged by while his 
mind circled uselessly. Finally 
he couldn’t stand the silence. “Cen- 
tral!” 

“Yes, Director?” 

“What’s happening?” 

“Oh, you wish interim reports? 
I’m sorry, I didn’t realize. Both 
fleets are waiting. I’ll have Fey- 
ooch’s parcel ready in a few min- 
utes.” 

“You’ll what?” 

“I’ll have his parcel ready. Direc- 
tor. You ordered me to solve the 
problem. Oh, I apologize; I should 
have kept up a commentary. But 
I was devoting all my circuits . 
I’m giving him three robots.” 

Klonit stared at the wall grill 
from which Central’s voice came. 
“Robots? No. You didn’t say ro- 
bots, did you? My ears . 

“Certainly, Director. You recall 
those biped robots we received, but 
didn’t ever unpack 'because you 
said the body shape wasn’t practi- 
cal? I’ve added a few touches to 
make them more convincing. I’ve 
put clothes on them, and given 
them a sort of food supply, in the 
form of energy units. Well, after 
all, Director, I only described the 
three creatures as bipeds. And I’m 
putting them in a standard pack- 
age. There. It’s finished. I’ll send 
it up to Feyooch now. Shall I send 
the three real creatures to Vinitas- 
sin at the same time?” 

“Huh?” 

“I asked, sihall I send the three 
MAIL DROP 



living bipeds and their ship to Vin- 
itassin now too?” 

Klonit shook. Carefully, he said, 
“Send nothing for a minute. Just 
hold everything. One minute. 
Right?” 

“As you say. Director. Mark.” 
Klonit let his body swell up with 
air, and for a good part of the 
minute, he simply screamed. When 
he ran out of breath, he gulped 
in more and went on screaming. He 
glanced at the wall timepiece, saw he 
had ten seconds left and screamed 
again. Then he lay limp, gasping. 
He felt much, much better. 

When he could talk again, he 
said calmly, his voice only a little 
unsteady, “Trust a computer to find 
the solution to a problem, then not 
-know how to apply it! No, no, NO! 
We’re not going to give anyone those 
three bipeds! Do you understand? 
Do you understand?” 

T here was a pause. Then Central 
said calmly, “I think I do. 
Director. You want me to prepare 
yet another parcel with three more 
robots. I’m starting it. The same 
crew of blens and toolbots can fin- 
ish it very quickly. Then, we’ll give 
one to each of those two fleets out 
there, and well (be left over with 
tne original parcel, w^hich caused 
all the trouble in the first place. But 
that’s your decision. You do not 
wish to take the opportunity to be 
rid of it!” 

Klonit hissed, “No, I don’t!” 

“As you say. Director. Shall I 
go ahead and send the first trio 
of robots to Feyooch?” 

“No. Send them to Vinitassin. 

55 




And don’t make anodier move; don’t 
even think about my ordering it. 
Do you hear?” 

There was a dead silence. Then, 
weakly, “Send the first batch to 
Vinitassin, Director?” 

“Yes! Now! Move!” 

Central achieved a very lifelike 
sigh. “It’s gone. And the second 
parcel’s finished. I don’t suppose 
you would let me change — ” 
“NO! Change nothing! Wait one 
minute, then start grawing the sec- 
ond fake parcel up to Feyooch!” 
“Yes, Director.” 

More minutes went by in silence. 
Finally, Klonit demanded, “Well?” 
“Vinitassin has taken possession 
of his parcel. The other one is 
still grawing up; but Feyooch is 
closing in on it, and it’s too late 
to withdraw it now. Would you tell 
me. Director, why you made me 
switch parcels like this?” 

Klonit sighed patiently. “It isn’t 
a matter of switching them. Cen- 
tral. It’s this way: the first was fin- 
ished several minutes ahead of the 
second — right?” 

“Yes, Director.” 

“Right. Now, if Feyooch got the 
first parcel and tried to accelerate 
away, preparatory to going into 
Translocator Drive, Vinitassin would 
try to stop him; do you see? There’d 
be a battle, and we’d get clobbered 
with stray missiles. But with Vini- 
tassin getting a parcel first — and 
thinking it’s the only one — he*ll 
leave immediately, having the outer 
position, and leave the way open 
for Feyooch. Probably, he’ll even 
gather up most of his mines. Uh, 
has he started yet?” 



“No, Director. But his fleet is 
gathering into a tight formation.” 
Klonit chuckled. “Well, he won’t 
delay long. I don’t want to belittle 
computer thinking. Central; but you 
see the difference, don’t you, in 
your way of thinking and mine?” 
“Well, Director, yes and no.” 
Klonit waited. As Central didn’t 
continue, he gradually grevv nerv- 
ous. “Well, is someting wrong?” 
“I’m afraid so. Director. You re- 
fused to let me explain. May I do 
so now?” 

“Explain what? Of course!” 

CC^'T^hank you. You see, I tried 
A to make the first three robots 
more convincing for Feyooch by 
engraving some manufacturer’s leg- 
end on them, in Medanjian script, 
rather than his own. And by the 
time you ordered me not to change 
my plan. I’d already had the tod- 
bots started engraving Selidan script 
on the other three, for Vinitassin. 
My idea was that each would think 
he’d captured some experimental 
robot of the enemy’s and rush off 
home with it. But when you switch- 
ed them . .” 

Klonit crouched for a minute, his 
legs half bent, then slowly sank to 
the floor. “Go on . Tell me . 
No. Don’t say any more for a 
while.” He let his head sag to the 
floor. A low moan escaped him. 
“And now — and now — neither 
one of them will be deceived. Is 
that what you think?” 

“It seems probable. Director, since 
each has three robots with markings 
on them in his own language.” 
Klonit crawled cringingly into a 



IF 



56 




corner. “Oh. Why didn’t I . 
Central, why didn’t you insist . 
Oh. Do you think there’ll be time 
for a last message to my family and 
friends?” 

“I think so, Director. There are 
no missiles coming yet.” 

Klonit let out a long, groaning 
sigh. “Very well, Central. You 
may record this: I, Klonit . No. 
I’m too ashamed. I can’t — can’t 
speak to them. Just tell them — 
tell that that, at the last, Klonit was 
humble and died without excessive 
bodily exudations. Will you do that 
much for me? Even if it’s — it’s 
not true?” 

“ril have the message ready to 
send, Director.” 

Klonit lay waiting, eyes squeezed 
shut. He squirmed himself into as 
tight a knot as he could, in one 
corner. Presently there was a mild 
jar. He quivered. “Was — was that 
the first missile. Central?” 

“No, Director. It was just a batch 
of routine mail I sent off.” 

Klonit opened one eye indiignant- 
ly. “Routine mail! Here I am about 
to die like a worm — I mean, all 
of us, all the live personnel and 
you, though I don’t suppose you 
care a foozlunk — and you send 
routine mail! Haven’t you any sensi- 
tivity at all?” 

Central seemed to hesitate. Then, 
“I didn’t want to rouse false hopes. 
Director. But maybe I’d better tell 
you that both fleets seem to be get- 
ting ready to leave and that no 
missiles have been launched yet.” 
Klonit scrambled up. “No mis- 
siles? Leaving? What . How — ” 
Central said, “Just a moment. 



Director. Yes! There goes Vinitassin. 
He seems to be ignoring the Seli- 
dan fleet. And now, there goes 
Feyooch! They’re vanishing,. Direc- 
tor! They’re both under maximum 
acceleration! I think — I mean, do 
I have your j>ermission. Director, 
to let the personnel out of the shel- 
ters?” 

L ater, Central was quite humble 
about the whole thing. “I hesi- 
tate to advance my theories. Direc- 
tor, in view of the demonstration 
we’ve just had of the superiority of 
protein^brain instincts to computer 
thinking, but on the basis of data 
available to me, this seems prob- 
able: Feyooch’s race and Vinitas- 
sin’s, as well, are hotbeds of intrigue 
and undercover politics. When Fey- 
ooch saw those unfamiliar robots 
with engraving on them in his own 
language, he immediately feared 
treachery at home. Why hadn’t he 
been informed about them, he must 
have speculated. Who of his race 
was carrying on clandestine experi- 
ments, without his knowledge? Were 
his superiors shunting him aside? 
So, after cautiously examining the 
robots to make sure they weren’t 
booby-trapped, he took his fleet 
home as fast as he could, ready to 
fight. And likewise for Vinitassin. 
Thei'e’s little doubt it worked out 
much better than my own clumsy 
plan. I feel I owe you the most ab- 
ject apologies. Director, for question- 
ing your judgment.” 

Klonit’s face-parts felt a little 
overwarm. “Uh, not at all, Badh of 
us has his place. I’ll trust you to 
send a discreet final report to the 



MAIL DROP

Chief Of Council. Meaiywhile, you’d 
better rig me uip aik>ther survey 
capsuHe; one with a good big stasisi 
field. I think I’ll take those three 
bipeds in their ship back where they 
came from. Don’t report that yet; 
we’ll slip it in quietly, later. No 
use stirring up a big fuss, eh?” 

IV 

K lonit hovered just outside the 
cave on Mars, pondering. He 
could show himself to the three 
bipeds right here, now, if he chose. 
He’d learned enough of their lan- 
guage to communicate easily. Or, 
he could take them on to Earth with 
him and save them the slow trip! 
they’d have to make otherwise. 

Finally, thou^, he decided he’d 
just leave them here, in their ship, 
snuggled in the cave. Let them have 
thedr moment of triumph before they 
had to learn the hard facts of galac- 
tic life. 

He approached Barth openly this 
time, so their radar would be sure 
of him. 

When excited babble on the ra- 
dio told him they’d spotted his cap- 
sule, he cleared his throat and be- 
gan the transmission: “People of 
Earth. I come in friendship. I am 
not a representative of any of the 
interstellar empires or alliances; I 
am merely ap employee of a com- 
paratively unimportant joint serv- 
ice. There are dangers . 

He let his voice roll on, rather 
proud of the way he was handling 
this new language. 

He sighed. “Tliere is much 
knowledge I could give you, but I 



am not authorizied to do so. Really, 
I’m overstepping my own functions 
by making this first contact at all. 
Please excuse me now. Perhaps at 
some time in the future I shall have 
the pleasure and privilege of visit- 
ing your planet. Your sun’s a little 
coolish, but if you could prepare 
a large vat of boiling mud . ” 
He realized he was degenerating into 
banalities. “Uh, good-bye for now.” 

J ason Clock sipped carefully at 
his second glass of wine. Mustn’t 
let himself get mellow. He turned 
toward the controls. “That sand- 
storm ought to be over by now. 
We’ll slip out and have a peep, eh?” 
He lifted the ship and backed out. 
“External viewers. Lieutenant.” 

“Yes, sir.” David Lobell flipped 
switches enthusiastically, and view- 
screens came on. “All clear, sir.” 
“Righto.” Clock swivelled his per- 
iscopic-viewer, looking for a good 
level place to set down, where the 
sun would >be at the right angle for 
pictures. 

Sarah Tolberg said tremulously, 
“Be careful. Colonel.” 

Clock gave her a brave smile. 
“Nothing out there. Major. Not even 
an ant. Only danger’s that something 
might go wrong with the suit or the 
lock; or that a meteorite could hit 
me. Pretty small chance of that.” 
David was looking wistfully at 
the viewscreens. “It does look aw- 
fully dead, sir. Are you sure we 
won’t find any artifacts? Are you 
sure we’re . well, alone? In 
the solar system at least? And hope- 
lessly isolated from the stars?” 
Clock smiled. “Quite sure.” END

THE 

SHADOW 

OF SPACE 

PHILIP JOSE FARMER 



Illustrated by Morrow 

They were the first to travel 
faster than light . and the 
first to know its deadly peril! 



I 

T he klaxon cleared its plastic 
throat and began <to whoop. Al- 
ternate yellow and reds pulsed on 
the consoles wrapped like bracelets 
around the wrists of the captain and 
the navigator. The huge auxiliary 
screens spaced on the bulkheads of 
the bridge also flashed red and 
yellow. 

Captain Grettir, catapulted from 
his reverie, and from his chair, sitood 



up. The letters and numerals 20- 
G-DZ-R hung burning on a sector 
of each screen and spurted up from 
the wrist-console, spread out ibefore 
his eyes, then disappeared, only to 
rise from the wrist -console again and 
magnify themselves and thin into 
nothing. Over and over again. 20- 
G-DZ-R. The code letters indicat- 
ing that the alarm originated from 
the corridor leading to the engine 
room. 

He turned his wrist and raised 



59 




his arm to place the lower half of 
the console at the correct viewing 
and speaking distance. 

“20-G-DZ-R, report!” 

The flaming, expanding, levitating 
letters died out, and the long high- 
cheekboned face of MacOool, chief 
engineer, appeared as a tiny image 
j On the sector of the console. It was 
'duplicated on the bridge bulkhead 
screens. It rose and grew larger, 
shooting towards Grettir, then wink- 
ing out to be followed by a second 
ballooning face. 

Also on the wrist-^console’s screen, 
behind MacCool, were Comas, a 
petty officer, and Grinker, a ma- 
chinist’s mate. Their faces did not 
float up because they were not in 
the central part of the screen. Be- 
hind them was a group of marines 
and an 88-K cannon on a floating 
sled. 

“It’s the Wellington woman,” Mac- 
Cool said. “She used a photer, low- 
power setting, to knock out the two 
guards stationed at the engine-room 
port. Then she herded us — me. 
Comas, Grinker — out. She said 
sheVi shoot us if we resisted. And 
she welded the grille to the ^bulk- 
head so it can’t be opened unless 
it’s burned off.” 

“I don’t know why she’s doing 
this. But she’s reconnected the drive 
wires to a zander bridge so she can 
control the acceleration herself. We 
can’t do a thing to stop her unless 
we go in after her.” 

H e paused, swallowed and said, 
“I could send men outside and 
have them try to get through the 
engine room airlock or else cut 



through the hull to get her. While 
she was distracted by this, we 
could make a frontal attack down 
the corridor. But she says she’ll 
shoot anybody that gets too close. 
We could lose some men. She means 
what she says.” 

“If you cut a hole in the hull, 
she’d be out of air, dead in a min- 
ute,” Grettir said. 

“She’s in a spacesuit,” MacCool 
replied. “That’s why I didn’t havei 
this area sealed off and gas flooded 
in.” 

Grettir hoped his face was not 
betraying his shock. Hearing an ex- 
clamation from Wanig, seated near 
him, Grettir turned his head. He 
said, “How in hell did she get out 
of sick bay?” 

He realized at the same time that 
Wang could not answer that ques- 
tion. MacCool said, “I don’t know, 
sir. Ask Doctor Wills.” 

“Never mind that now!” 

Grettir stared at the sequence of 
values appearing on the navigator’s 
auxiliary bulkhead-screen. The 0.5 
of light speed had already climbed 
to 0.96. It changed every 4 seconds. 
The 0.96 became 0.97, then 0.98, 
0.99 and then 1.0. And then 1.1 
and 1.2. 

Grettir forced himself to sit back 
down. If anything was going to 
happen, it would have done so by 
now; the TSN-X cruiser Sleipnir, 
280 million tons, would have been 
converted to pure energy. 

A nova, bright but very brief, 
would have gouted in the heavens. 
And the orbiting telescopes of Earth 
would see the flare in 20.8 light- 
years.

IF 




“What’s the state of the emc 
clamp and acceleration-dissipaters?” 
Grettir said. 

“No strain — yet,” Wang said. 
“But the power drain ... if it con- 
tinues .... 5 megakilowatts per 2 
seconds, and we’re just heginning.” 
“I think,” Grettir said slowly, 
“that we’re going to find out what 
we intended to find out. But it isn’t 
going to be under the carefully con- 
trolled conditions we had planned.” 

T he Terran Space Navy experi- 
mental cruiser Sleipnir had left 
its base on Asgard, eighth planet 
of Altair (alpha Aquilae), 28 ship- 
days ago. It was under orders to 
make the first attempt of a manned 
ship to exceed the velocity of light. 
If its mission was successful, men 
could travel between Earth and the 
colonial planets in weeks instead of 
years. The entire galaxy might be 
opened to Earth. 

Within the past two weeks, the 
Sleipnir had made several tests at 
0.8 times the velocity of light, the 
tests lasting up to two hours at a 
time. 

The Sleipnir was equipped with 
enormous motors and massive 
clamps, dissipaters and space-time 
structure expanders ( “hole-open- 
ers”) required for near4ightspeeds 
and beyond. No ship in Terrestrial 
history had ever had such power 
or the means to handle such power. 

The drive itself — the cubed 
amplification of energy produced by 
the controlled mixture of matter, 
antimatter and half-matter — gave 
an energy that could eat its way 
through fhe iron core of a planet. 



But part of that energy had to be 
diverted to power the energy-mass 
conversion “clamp” that kept the 
ship from being transformed into 
energy itself. The “hole-opener” also 
required vast power. Tliis device 
— officially the Space-Time Struc- 
ture Expander, or Neutralizer — 
“unbent” the local curvature of the 
universe and so furnished a “hole” 
through which the Sleipnir traveled. 
This hole nullified 99.3 per cent of 
the resistance the Sleipnir would 
normally have encountered. 

Thus the effects of speeds ap- 
proaching and even exceeding light- 
speed, would be modified, even if 
not entirely avoided. The Sleipnir 
should not contract along its length 
to zero nor attain infinite mass when 
it reached the speed of light. It con- 
tracted, and it swelled, yes, by only 
l/777,777th what it should have. 
The ship would assume the shape 
of a disk — but much more slowly 
than it would without its openers, 
clamps and dissipaters. 

Beyond the speed of light, who 
knew what would happen? It was 
the business of the Sleipnir to find 
out. But, Grettir thou^t, not un- 
der these conditions. Not wUly-nil- 

ly. 

4 4Qir!” MacCool said, “Wellington 
O threatens to shoot anybody 
who comes near the engine room.” 

He hesitated, then said, “Except 
you. She wants to speak to you. But 
she doesn’t want to do it over the 
intercom. She insists that you come 
down and talk to her face to face.” 
Grettir bit his lower lip and made 
a sucking sound. 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE 



61 




“Why me?” he said, but he knew 
why, and MacCool’s expression 
showed that he also knew. 

“I’ll he down in a minute. Now, 
isn’t there any way we can con- 
nect a bypass, route a circuit around 
her or beyond her and get control 
of the drive again?” 

“No, sir!” 

“Then she’s cut through the en- 
gine-room deck and gotten to the 
redundant circuits also?” 

MacCool said, “She’s crazy, but 
she’s clear-headed enough to take 
all precautions. She hasn’t overlooked 
a thing.” 

Grettir said, “Wang! What’s the 
velocity now?” 

“2.3 sl/pm, sir!” 

Grettir looked at the huge star- 
screen on the “forward” bulkhead of 
the bridge. Black except for a few 
glitters of white, blue, red, green, 
and the galaxy called XD-2 that 
lay dead ahead. The galaxy had 
been the size of an orange, and it 
still was. He stared at the screen for 
perhaps a minute, then said, “Wang, 
am I seeing right? The red light 
from XD-2 is shifting towards the 
blue, right?” 

“Right, sir!” 

“Then , . why isn’t XD-2 get- 
ting bigger? We’re overhauling it 
like a fox after a rabbit.” 

Wang said, “I think it’s getting 
closer, sir. But we’re getting bigger.” 

II 

G rettir rose from the chair. “Take 
over while I’m gone. Turn off 
the alarm; tdl the crew to continue 
their normal duties. If anything 



comes up while I’m in the engine 
area, notify me at once.” 

The exec saluted. “Yes, sir!” sihp 
said huskily. 

Grettir strode off the bridge. He 
was aware that the officers and crew- 
men seated in the ring of chairs in 
the bridge were looking covertly at 
him. He stopped for a minute to 
light up a cigar. He was glad that his 
hands were not shaking, and he 
hoped that his expression was con- 
fident. Slowly, repressing the im- 
pulse to run, he continued across 
the bridge and into the jump-shaft. 
He stepped off backward into the 
shaft and nonchalantly blew out 
smoke while he sank out of sight of 
the men in the bridge. He braced 
himself against the quick drop and 
then the thrusting deceleration. He 
had set the controls for Dock 14; 
the doors slid open; he walked into 
a corridor where a g-car and op^er- 
ator waited for him. Grettir climbed 
in, sat down and told the crewman 
where to drive to. 

Two minutes later, he was with 
MacCool. The chief engineer pointed 
down the corridor. Near its end on 
the floor, were two still unconscious 
Marines. The door to the engine 
room was open. The secondary door, 
the grille, was shut. The lights with- 
in the engine room had been turned 
off. Something white on the other 
side of the grille moved. It was 
Donna Wellington’s face, visible 
through the helmet. 

“We can’t keep this acceleration 
up,” Grettir said. “We’re already 
going far faster than even unmanned 
experimental ships have been allow- 
ed to go. There are all sorts of 



62 



IF 




theories about what might happen 
to a ship at these speeds, all bad.” 

“We’ve disproved several by now,” 
MacCool said. He spoke evenly, but 
his forehead was sweaty and shadows 
hung under his eyes. 

MacCool continued, “I’m glad you 
got here, sir. She just threatened to 
cut the emc damp wires if you 
didn’t show up within the next two 
minutes.” 

He gestured with both hands to 
indicate a huge and expanding ball 
©f light. 

“I’ll talk to her,” Grettir said. 
“Although I can’t imagine what she 
wants.” 

MacCool looked dubious. Grettir 
wanted to ask him what the hell 
he was thinking but thought better 
of it. He said, “Keep your men at 
this post. Don’t even look as if 
you’re coming after me.” 

“And what do we do, sir, if she 
shoots you?” 

Grettir winced. “Use the cannon. 
And never mind hesitating if I hap- 
pen to ibe in the way. Blast her! 
But make sure you use a ibeam short 
enough to get her but not long 
enough to touch the engines.” 

“May I ask why we don’t do that 
before you put your life in dan- 
ger?” MacCool said. 

Grettir hesitated, then said, “My 
main responsibility is to the ship 
and its crew. But this woman is very 
sick; she doesn’t realize the implica- 
tions of her actions. Not fully any- 
way. I want to talk her out of this, 
if I can.” 

H e unhooked the communicator 
from his belt and walked down 



the corridor toward the grille and 
the darkness behind it and the white- 
ness that moved. His back prickled. 
The men were watching him intent- 
ly. God knew what they were say- 
ing, or at least thinking, about him. 
The whole crew had been amused 
for some time by Donnia Welling- 
ton’s passion for him and his in- 
ability to cope with her. They had 
said she was mad about him, not 
realizing that she really was mad. 
They had laughed. But they were 
not laughing now. 

Even so, knowing that she was 
truly insane, some of them must be 
blaming him for this danger. Un- 
doubtedly, they were thinking that 
if he had handled her differently, 
they would not now be so cfose to 
death. 

He stopped just one step short 
of the grille. Now he could see Wel- 
lington’s face, a checkerboard of 
blacks and whites. He waited for 
her to speak first. A full minute 
passed, then she said, “Robert!” 
The voice, normally low-pdtched 
and pleasant, was now thin and 
strained. 

“Not Robert. Eric,” he said into 
the communicator. “Captain Eric 
Grettir, Mrs. Wellington.” 

There was a silence. She moved 
closer to the grille. Light struck one 
eye, which gleamed bluely. 

“Why do you hate me so, Rob- 
ert?” she said plaintively. “You used 
to love me. What did I do to make 
you turn against me?” 

“I am not your husband,” Grettir 
said. “Look at me. Can’t you see that 
I am not Robert Wellington? I am 
Captain Grettir of the. Sleipnir, You 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE

must see who I really am, Mrs. Well- 
ington. It is very imiportant.” 

“You don’t love me!” she scream- 
ed. “You are trying to get rid of 
me by pretending you’re another 
man! But it won’t work! I’d know 
you anywhere, you beast! You 
beast! I hate you, Robert!” 

Involuntarily, Grettir stepped 
back under the intensity of her an- 
ger. He saw her hand come up from 
the shadows and the flash of light 
on a handgun. It was too late then; 
she fired; a beam of whiteness daz- 
zled him. 

Light was followed by darkness. 

Ahead, or above, there was a 
disk of grayness in the black. Gret- 
tir traveled slowly and spasmodically 
towards it, as if he had been swal- 
lowed by a whale but was being 
ejected tovwds the open mouth, the 
muscles of the Leviathan’s throat 
working him outwards. 

Far behind him, deep in the bow- 
els of the whale, Donna Wellington 
spoke. 

“Robert?” 

“Eric!” he shouted. “I’m EricT 

T he Sleipnir, barely on its way 
out from Asgard, dawdling at 
6200 kilometers per second, had 
picked up the Mayday call. It came 
from a spaceship midway between 
the 12th and 13th planet of Altair. 
Although Grettir could have ig- 
nored the call without reprimand 
from his superiors, he altered course, 
and he found a ship wrecked by a 
meteorite. Inside the hull was half 
the body of a man. And a woman 
in deep shock. 

Pvobert and Donna Wellington 



were second-generation Asgairdiaios, 
Ph.D.’s in biotatology, holding mas- 
ter’s papers in astrogation. They 
had been searching for specimens of 
“space plankton” and “space hyd- 
ras,” forms of life born in the re- 
gions between Altair’s outer plan- 
ets. 

The crash, the death of her hus- 
band and the shattering sense of 
isolation, dissociation and hopeless- 
ness during the eighty-four hours 
before rescue had twist^ Mrs. Well- 
ington. Perhaps twisted was the 
wrong word. Fragmented was a bet- 
ter description. 

From the beginning of what at 
first seemed recovery, she had taken 
a superficial resemblance of Grettir 
to her husband for an identity. Gret- 
tir had been gentle and kind with 
her at the beginning and had made 
frequent visits to sick bay. Later, 
advised by Doctor Wills, he had been 
severe with her. 

And so the unforseen result. 

Donna Wellington screamed be- 
hind him and, suddenly, the twilight 
circle ahead became bright, and he 
was free. He opened his eyes to 
see faces over him. Doctor Wills 
and MacCool. He was in sick bay. 

MacCool smiled and said, “For a 
moment, we thought . .” 

“What happened?” Grettir said. 
Then, “I know what she did. I 
mean — ” 

“She fired full power at you,” 
MacCool said. “But the bans of 
the grille absorbed most of the en- 
ergy. You got just enough to crisp 
the skin off your face and to knock 
you out. Good thiag you closed 
your eyes in time.”

Grettir sat up. He felt his face; 
it was covered with a greasy oint- 
menit, pain-deadenmg and skin- 
growing resec, 

“I got a hell of a (headache.” 

Doctor Wills said, “It’ll be gone 
in a minute.” 

“What’s the situation?” Grettir 
said. “How’d you get me away from 
her?”- 

MacCool said, “I had to do it, 
Captain. Otherwise, she’d have taken 
another shot at you. The cannon 
blasted what was left of the grille. 
Mrs. Wellington — ” 

“She’s dead?” 

“Yes. But the cannon didn’t get 
her. Strange. She took her suit off, 
stripped to the skin. Then she went 
out through the airlock in the engine 
room. Naked, as if she meant to 
be the bride of Death. We almost 
got caught in the outrush of air, 
since she fixed the controls so that 
the inner port remained open. It was 
dose, but we got the port shut in 
time.” 

Grettir said, “I . never mind. 
Any damage to the engine room?” 

“No. And the wires are reconnect- 
ed for normal operation. Only — ” 

“Only what?” 

MacCool’s face was so long he 
looked like a frightened bloodhound. 

“Just before I reconnected the 
wires, a funny . peculiar . 
thing happeni^. The whole ship, 
and everything inside the ship, went 
through a sort of distortion. Wavy, 
as if we’d all become wax and were 
dripping. Or flags flapping in a 
wind. The bridge reports that the 
fore of the ship seemed to expand 
like a balloon, then became ripply, 



and the entire effect passed through 
the ship. We all got nauseated while 
the waviness lasted.” 

There was silence, but their ex- 
pressiions indicated that there was 
more to be said. 

“Well?” 

MacCool and Wills looked at each 
other. MacCool swallowed and said, 
“Captain, we don’t know where in 
hell we are!” 

Ill 

O n the bridge, Grettir examined 
theiiafward EXT. screen. There 
wcir^Hb kis. Space everywhere was 
filled wiith a light as gray and as 
dull as that of a false dawn on 
Earth. In the gray igjow, at a dis- 
tance as yet undetermined, were a 
number of spheres. They looked 
small, but if they were as large as 
the one immediately aft of the 
Sleipnir, they were huge. 

The sphere behind them, estimated 
to ibe at a distance of fifty kilo- 
meters, was about the size of Earth’s 
moon, relative to the ship. Its sur- 
face was as smooth and as igray as 
a ball of lead. 

Dari spoke a hinary code into 
her wrist-console, and the sphere 
on the starscreen seemed to shoot 
towards them. It filled the screen 
until Dari changed the line-of-sight. 
They were looking at about 20 de- 
grees of arc of the limb of the 
sphere. 

“There it is!” Dari said. A small 
object floated around the edge of 
the sphere and seemed to shoot 
towards them. She magnified it, and 
it became a small gray sphere.

“It orbits round tihe big one,” sbe 
said. 

Dari paused, then said, “We — 
the ship — came out of that small 
sphere. Out of iit. Through its skin.” 

“You mean we had been inside 
it?” Grettir said. “And now we’re 
outside it?” 

“Yes, sir! Exactly!” 

She gasped and said, “Oh, oh — 
sir!” 

Around the large sphere, slightly 
above the plane of the orbit of the 
small sphere but within its sweep 
in lan inner orbit, sped another ob- 
ject. At least fifty times as large 
as the small globe, it caught up 
with the globe, and the two dis- 
appeared together around the curve 
of the primary. 

“Wellington’s body!” Grettir said. 

He turned away from the screen, 
took one step, and turned around 
again. “It’s not right! She should 
be trailing along behind us or at 
least parallel with us, maybe shoot- 
ing off at an angle but still moving 
in our direction. 

“But she’s been grabbed by the 
big sphere! She’s in orbit! And her 
size; Gargantuan! It doesn’t make 
sense! It shouldn’t be!” 

“Nothing should,” Wang said. 

‘Take us back,” Grettir said. 
“Establish an orbit around the pri- 
mary, on the same plane as the sec- 
ondary but further out, approximate- 
ly a kilometer and a half from it.” 

Dari’s expression said, “Then 
what?” 

Grettir wondered if she had the 
same thought as he. The faces of 
the others on the bridge were doubt- 
ful. The fear was covered but leak- 



ing out. He could smell the rotten 
bubbles. Had they guessed, too? 

“Whiat attraction does the primary 
have on the ship?” he said to Wang. 

“No detectable influience whatso- 
ever, sir. The Sleipnir seems to have 
a neutral charge, neither positive 
nor negative in relation to any of 
the spheres. Or to Wellington’s . 
body.” 

Grettir was slightly relieved. His 
thoughts had been so wild that he 
had not been able to consider them 
as anything but hysterical fantasies. 
But Wangi’s answer showed that 
Grettir’s idea was also his. Instead 
of replying in tenns of gravitational 
force, he had talked as if the ship 
were a subatomic particle. 

But if the ship was not aiffected 
by the primary, why had Welling- 
ton’s corpse been attracted by the 
primary? 

“Our velocity in relation to the 
primairy?” Grettir said. 

“We cut off the acceleration as 
soon as the wires were reconnected.” 
Wang said. 

This was immediately after we 
came out into this . this space. 
We didn’t apply any retrodrive. 
Our velocity, as indicated by 
power consumption, is ten mega- 
parsecs per minute. That is,” he 
added after a pause, “what the in- 
struments show. But our radar, which 
should be totally ineffective at this 
velocity, indicates 50 kilometers per 
minute, relative to the big sphere.” 

Wang leaned back in his chair 
as if he expected Grettir to ex- 
plode into incredulity. Grettir lit 
up another cigar. This time, his 
hands shook. He blew out a big puff

of smoke amd said, ‘‘Obviously, we’re 
opeiraifemig under doffenenit quote laws 
unquote out here** 

Wang sighed softly. “So you 
think so, too, Oaptain? Yes, di^br- 
ent laws. Which means that every 
time we make a move tihrough this 
space, we can’t know what the re- 
sult will be. May I ask what you 
plan to do, sir?” 

B y this question, which Wang 
would never have dared to voice 
before, though he had doubtless 
often thought it, Grettir knew that 
the navigator shared his anxiety. Be- 
neath that apparently easy manner 
and soft voice was a pain just be- 
neath the navel. The umbilical had 
been ripped out; Wang was hurting 
and bleeding inside. Was he, too, 
beglimmg to float away in a gray 
void? Bereft as no man had even 
been bereft? 

It takes a special type of man or 
woman to lose himself from Earth 
or his native planet, to go out among 
the stiars so far that the natal sun 
is not even a faint igjimmer. It also 
takes special conditioning for the 
special type of m'an. He has to be- 
lieve, in the deepest part of his un- 
conscious, that his ship is a piece 
of Mother Earth. He has to believe; 
otherwise, he goes to pieces. 

can be done. Hundreds do it. 
But nothing had prepared even these 
farfarers for absolute divorce from 
the universe itself. 

Grettir ached with the dread of 
the void. The void was coiling up 
inside him, a gray serpent, a slither 
of nothingness. Coiling. And what 
would happen when it uncoiled? 



And what would happen to the 
crew when they were informed — 
as they must ibe — of the utter dis- 
sociation? 

There was only one way to keep 
their minds from slipping their 
moorings. They must believe that 
they could get back into the world. 
Just as he must believe it. 

“I’ll play it by ear,” Grettir said. 

“What? Sir?” 

“Play it by ear!” Grettir said 
more harshly than he had intended. 
“I was merdy answering your ques- 
tion. Have you forgotten you asked 
me what I meant to do?” 

“Oh, no, sir,” Wang said. “I was 
just thinking . .” 

“Keep your mind on the job,” 
Grettir said. He tdd I>arl he would 
take over. He spoke the code to 
activate the ALIr^TATIONS; a low 
rising-falling sound went into every 
room of the Sleipnir, and all screens 
flashed a black-and-green checked 
pattern. Then the warnings, visual 
and audible, died out, and Ihe cap- 
tain spoke. 

He talked for two minutes. The 
bridgemen looked as if the lights 
had been turned off in their brains. 
It was almost impossible to grasp 
the concept of their being outside 
their universe. As difficult was 
thinking of their unimaginably vast 
native cosmos as only an “electron” 
orbiting around the nucleus of an 
“atom.” If what the captain said was 
true (how could it be?), the ship 
was in the space between the super- 
atoms of a supermoleoule of a sup- 
eruniverse. 

Even though they knew that the 
Sleipnir had ballooned under the

IF 




effect of nearly 300,000 times the 
speed of light, they could not wrap 
the fingers of their minds around 
the concept. It turned to smoke and 
drifted away. 

I t took ten minutes, ship’s time, 
to turn and to complete the ma- 
neuvers which placed the Sleipnir 
in an orbit parallel to but out- 
side the secondary, or, as Grettir 
thought of it, “our universe.” He 
gave his chair back to Dad and 
paced back and forth across the 
bridge while he watched the star- 
screen. 

If they were experiencing the sun- 
dering, the cutting-off, they were 
keeping it under control. They had 
been told by their captain that they 
were going back in, not that they 
would make a try at re-entry. They 
had been through much with him, 
and he had never failed them. With 
this trust, they could endure the 
agony of dissolution. 

As the Sleipnir established itself 
parallel to the secondary, Welling- 
ton’s body curved around the pri- 
mary again and began to pass the 
small sphere and ship. The arms 
of the mountainous body were ex- 
tended stiffly to both sides, and her 
legs spread out. In the gray light, 
her skin was bluish-black from the 
ruptured veins and arteries bdow 
the skin. Her red hair, coiled in 
a Psyche knot, looked black. Her 
eyes, each of which was larger than 
the bridge of the Sleipnir, were open, 
bulging clots of black blood. Her 
lips were pulled back in a grimace, 
the teeth like a soot-streaked port- 
cullis. 



Cartwheeling, she passed the 
sphere and the ship. 

Wang reported that there were 
three “shadows” on the surface of 
the primary. Those were keeping 
pace with the secondary, the corpse 
and the ship. Magnified on the 
bridge-bulkhead screen, each “shad- 
ow” was the silhouette of one of 
the three orbiting bodies. The shad- 
ows were only about one shade 
darker than the surface and were 
caused iby a shifting pucker in the 
primary skin. The surface protruded 
along the edges of the shadows and 
formed a shallow depression with- 
in the edges. 

If the shadow of the Sleipnir was 
a true indication of the shape of 
the vessel, the Sleipnir had lost its 
needle ^ape and was a spindle, fat 
at both ends and narrow-waisted. 

When Wellington’s corpse passed 
by the small sphere and the ship, 
her sibadow or “print” reversed it- 
self in shape. Where the head of 
the shadow should have been, the 
feet now were and vice versa. 

She disappeared around the curve 
of the primary and, on returning on 
the other side, her shadow had 
again become a “true” reflection. 
It .remained so until she passed the 
secondary, after which the shadow 
once more reversed itself. 

Grettir had been informed that 
there seemed to be absolutely no 
matter in the space outside the 
spheres. There was not one de- 
tectaible atom or particle. Moreover, 
despite the lack of 'any radiation, 
the temperature of the hull, and 
ten meters beyond the hull, was a 
fluctuating 70 plus-or-minus 20 F. 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE

IV 



T hree orbits later, Grettir knew 
that the ship had diminished 
greatly in size. Or else the small 
sphere had expanded. Or both chang- 
es occurred. Moreover, on the vis- 
ual screen, the secondary had lost 
its spherical shape and become a 
fat disk during the first circling of 
the ship to establish its orbit. 

Grettir was puzzling over this and 
thinking of calling Van Voorden, the 
physicist chief, when Wellington’s 
corpse came around the primary 
again. The body caught up with the 
other satellites, and for a moment 
the primary, secondary, and the 
Sleipnir were in a line, strung on an 
invisible cord. 

Suddenly, the secondary and the 
corpse jumped toward each other. 
They ceased their motion when with- 
in a quarter kilometer of each other. 
Tlie secondary regained its globular 
form as soon as it had attained its 
new orbit. Wellington’s arms and 
legs, during this change in position, 
moved in as if she had come to life. 
Her arms folded themselves across 
her breasts, and her legs drew up 
so that her thighs were against her 
belly. 

Grettir called Van Voorden. The 
physicist said, “Out here,” the cabin 
boy — if we had one — knows as 
much as I do about what’s going on 
or what to expect. The data, such 
as they are, are too inadequate, too 
confusing. 1 can only suggest that 
there was an interchange of energy 
between Wellington and the secon- 
dary.” 

“A quantum jump?” Grettir said. 



“If that’s so, why didn’t the ship 
experience a loss or gain?” 

Dari said, “Pardon, sir. But it 
did. There was a loss of 50 mega- 
kilowatts in 0.8 second. “ 

Van Voorden said, “The Sleipnir 
may have decreased in relative size 
because of decrease in velocity. Or 
maybe velocity had nothing to do 
with it or only partially, anyway. 
Maybe the change in spatial interre- 
lationships among bodies causes 
other changes. In shape, size, ener- 
gy transfer and so forth. I don’t 
know. Tell me, how big is the 
woman — corpse — relative to the 
ship now?” 

“The radar measurements say she’s 
eighty-three times as large. She in- 
creased. Or we’ve decreased.” 

Van Voor den’s eyes grew even 
larger. Grettir thanked him and cut 
him off. He ordered the Sleipnir to 
be put in exactly the same orbit 
as the secondary but ten dekameters 
ahead of it. 

Van Voorden called back. “The 
jump happened when we were in 
line with the other three bodies. 
Maybe the Sleipnir’s is some sort of 
geometrical catalyst under certain 
conditions. That’s only an analogy, 
of course.” 

Wang verbally fed the order into 
the computer-interfact, part of his 
wrist-console. The Sleipnir was soon 
racing ahead of the sphere. Radar 
reported that the ship and secondary 
were now approximately equal in 
size. The corpse, coming around the 
primary again, was still the same 
relative size as before. 

Grettir ordered the vessel turned 
around so that the nose would be

IF 




facing the sphere. This accomplished, 
he had the velocity xeduoed. The 
retrodrive ibraked (them while the 
lateral thrusts readjusted forces to 
keep the ship in the same oihit. 
Since the primary had no attraction 
for the Sleipnir, the ship had to re- 
main in orbit with a constant re- 
balancing of thrusts. The sphere, 
now ballooning, inched towards the 
ship. 

“Radar indicates we’re doing 26.6 
dekameters per second relative to the 
primary,” Wang said. “Power drain 
indicates we’re making 25,000 times 
the speed of light. That, by the way, 
is not proportionate to what we were 
making when we left our world.” 

“More (bralking,” Grettir said. 
“Cut it down to 15 dm.” 

The sphere swelled, filled the 
screen, and Grettir involuntarily 
braced himself for the impact, even 
though he was so far from expecting 
one that he had not strapped him- 
self into a chair. There had been 
none when the ship had broken 
through the “skin” of the universe. 

Grettir had been told of the dis- 
torting in the ship when it had left 
the universe and so was not en- 
tirely surprised. Nevertheless, he 
could not help being both frightened 
and bewildered when the front part 
of the bridge abruptly swelled and 
then rippled. Screen, bulkheads, deck 
and crew waved as if they were 
cloth in a strong wind. Grettir felt 
as if he were being folded into a 
thousand different angles ait the 
same time. 

T lien Wang cried out, and the 
others repeated his cry. Wang 



rose from his seat and put his hands 
out before him. Gretdr, standing be- 
hind and to one side of him, was 
frozen as he saw dozens of Iktle 
objects, firefly-size, burning bright- 
ly, slip through the starscreen and 
bulkhead and drift towards him. He 
came out of his paralysis in time 
to dodge one tiny whiteiy glowing 
ball. But another struck his fore- 
head, causing him to yelp. 

A score of the bodies passed by 
him. Some were white; some blue; 
some green; one was topaz. They 
were at all levels, above his head, 
even with his waist, one almost 
touching the deck. He crouched 
down to let two pass over him, 
and as he did so, he saw Nagy, the 
communications officer, bent over 
and vomiting. The stuff sprayed out 
of his mouth and caught a little 
glow in-it and snuffed it out in a 
burst of smoke. 

Then the forepart of the bridge 
had reasserted its solidity and con- 
stancy of shape. There were no more 
burning objects coming tihrou^. 

Grettir turned to sec the aift 
bulkheads of the hridge quivering 
in the wake of the wave. And they, 
too, became normal. Grettir shout^ 
the “override” code so that he 
could take control from Wang, who 
was screaming with pain. He direct- 
ed the ship to change its course to 
an “upward vertical” direction. 
There was no “upward” sensation, 
because the artificial gHfield within 
the ship readjusted. Suddenly, the 
forward part of the bridge became 
distorted again, and the waves 
reached through the fabric of the 
ship and the crew. 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE 



71 




The starscreen, which had been 
showing nothing but the blackness 
of space, speckled by a few stars, 
now displayed the great igray sphere 
in one corner and the crepuscular 
light. Grettir, fighting the pain in 
his forehead and the oausea, gave 
another command. There was a 
delay of possibly thirty seconds, 
and then the Sleipnir <began the turn 
that would take it back into a par- 
allel orbit with the secondary. 

Grettir, realizing what was hap- 
ening shortly after being burned, 
had taken the Sleipnir back out of 
the universe. He put in a call for 
corpsmen and Doctor Wills and 
then helped Wang from his chair. 
There was an odor of burned flesh 
and hair in the bridge which the 
air-conditioning system had not as 
yet removed. Wang’s face and hands 
were burned in five or six places, 
and part of his long coarse black 
hair on the righf side of his head 
was bumed. ' 

Three corpsmen and Wills ran 
into the bridge. Wills started to 
apply a pseudoprotein jelly on Gret- 
tir’s forehead, but Grettir told him 
to take care of Wang first. Wills 
worked swiftly and then, after 
spreading the jelly over Wang’s 
burns and placing a false-skin 
bandage over the bums, treated the 
captain. As soon as the jelly was 
placed on his forehead, Grettir felt 
the pain dissolve. 

“Third degree,” Wills said. “It’s 
lucky those things — whatever they 
are — weren’t larger.” 

Grettir picked up his cigar, which 
he had dropped on the deck when 
he had first seen the objects racing 



towards him. The cigar was still 
burning. Near it lay a coal, swiftly 
blackening. He picked it up gingerly. 
It felt warm but could be held 
without too much discomfort. 

Grettir extended his hand, palm 
up, so that the doctor could see 
the speck of black matter in it. It 
was even smaller than when k had 
floated into the bridge through the 
momentarily “opened” interstices of 
the molecules composing the hull 
and bulkheads. 

“This is a galaxy,” he whispered. 

D oc Wills did not understand. 

“A galaxy of our universe,” 
Grettir added. 

Doc Wills paled, and he gulped 
loudly. 

“You mean . ?” 

Gritter nodded. 

Wills said, “I hope . not our 
. Earth’s . Galaxy!” 

“I doubt it,” Grettir said. “We 
were on- the edge of the star fields 
farthest out, that is, the closest to 
the — skin? — of our universe. But 
if we had kept on going . ” 
Wills shook his head. Billions of 
stars, possibly millions of inhabitable, 
hence inhabited, planets, were in 
that little ball of fire, now cool and 
collapsed. Trillions of sentient be- 
ings and an ummaginable number of 
animals had died when their world 
collided with Grettir’s forehead. 

Wang, informed of the true cause 
of his bums, became ill again. Gret- 
tir ordered him to sick bay and 
replaced him with Gomez. Van 
Voorden entered the bridge. He said, 
“I suppose our main objective has 
to be our re-entry. But why couldn’t 



72 



IF 




we make an attempt to penetrate the 
primary, the nucleus? Do you real- 
ize what an astounding . ?” 

Grettir interrupted. “I realize. But 
our fuel supply is low, very low. If 
— I mean, when we get back 
through the ‘skin,’ we’ll have a long 
way to go before we can return to 
Base. Maybe too long. I don’t dare 
exceed a certain speed during re- 
entry (because of our size. It would 
be too dangerous ... I don’t want 
to wipe out any more galaxies. God 
knows the psychological problems 
we are going to have when the 
guilt really hits. Right now, we’re 
numbed. No! We’re not going to do 
any exploring!” 

‘"But there may be no future in- 
vestigations permitted!” Van Voor- 
den said. “There’s too much danger 
to the universe itself to allow any 
more research by ships like ours!” 

“Exactly,” Grettir said. “I sym- 
pathize with your desire to do 
scientific research. But the safety 
of the ship and crew comes first. 
Besides, I think that if I were to 
order an exploration, I’d have muti- 
ny on my hands. And I couldn’t 
blame my men. Tell me. Van Voor- 
den, don’t you feel a sense of . 
dissociation?” 

Van Voorden nodded and said, 
“But I’m willing to fight it. There 
is so much . ” 

“So much to find out,” Orettir 
said. “Agreed. But the authorities 
will have to determine if that is to 
be done.” 

Grettir dismissed him. Van Voor- 
den marched off with a straight 
back and an angry set to his shoul- 
ders and neck. But he did not give 



the impression of a powerful anger. 
He was, Grettir thought, secretly 
relieved at the captain’s decision. 
Van Voorden had miade his protest 
for Science’s sake. But as a human 
being, Van Voorden must want very 
much to get “home.” 

V 

A t the end of the ordered maneu- 
ver, the Sleipnir was in the 
same orbit as the universe but twen- 
ty kilometers ahead and again point- 
ed toward it. Since there was no 
attraction between ship and primary, 
the Sleipnir had to use power to 
maintain the orbit; a delicate re- 
adjustmdnt of lateral thrust was 
constantly required. 

Grettir ordered braking applied. 
The sphere expanded on the star- 
screen, and then there was only a 
gray surface displayed. To the view- 
ers the surface did not seem to spin, 
but radar 'had determined that the 
globe completed a revolution on its 
polar axis once every 33 seconds. 

Grettir did not like to think of 
the implications of this. Van Voor- 
den undoubtedly had received the 
report, but he had made no move 
to notify the captain. Perhaps, like 
Grettir, he believed that the fewer 
who thought about it, the better. 

The mockup screen showed, in 
silhouette form, the relative sizes of 
the approaching spheres and the ship. 
The basketball was the universe; the 
toothpick, the Sleipnir. Grettir hop- 
ed that this reduction would be 
enough to avoid running into any 
more galaxies. Immediately after the 
vessel penetrated the “skin,” the 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE 



73 




Sleipnir would be again braked, thus 
further diminishing it. There should 
be plenty of distance between the 
skin and the edge of the closest 
star fields. 

“Here we go,” Grettir said, 
watching the screen which indicated 
in meters the gap between ship and 
sphere. Again he involuntarily brac- 
ed himself. 

There was a rumble, a groan. The 
deck slanted upwards, then rolled 
to port. Grettir was hurled to the 
deck, spun over and over and 
brought up with stunning impact 
against a bulkhead. He was in a 
daze for a moment, and by the time 
he had recovered, the ship had 
reasserted its proper attitude. Gomez 
bad placed the ship into “level” 
again. He had a habit of strapping 
himself into the navigator’s chair 
although regulations did not require 
it unless the captain ordered it. 

Grettir asked for a report on any 
damage and, while waiting for it, 
called Van Voorden. The physicist 
was Weeding from a cut on his fore- 
head. 

“Obviously,” he said, “it requires 
a certain force to penetrate the out- 
er covering or energy shield or 
whiaitever it is that encloses the uni- 
verse. We didn’t have it. So — ” 

“Presents quite a problem,” Gret- 
tir said. “If we go fast enough to 
rip through, we’re too large and may 
destroy entire galaxies. If we go too 
slow, we can’t get through.” 

He paused, then said, “I can 
think of only one method. But I’m 
ignorant of the consequences, which 
might be disastrous. Not for us but 
for the universe. I’m not sure I 

74 



should even take such a chance.” 
He was silent so long that Van 
Voorden could not restrain him- 
self. “WeU?” 

“Do you think that if we could 
make a hole in the skin, the rup- 
ture might result in some sort o-f 
collapse or cosmic disturbance?” 
“You want to beam a hole in the 
skin?” Van Voorden said slowly. 
His skin was pale, but it had been 
that color before Grettir asked him 
the question. Grettir wondered if 
Van Voorden was beginning to 
crumble under the “dissociation.” 
“Never mind,” Grettir said. “I 
shouldn’t have asked you. You can’t 
know what effects would be any 
more than anyone else. I apologize. 
I must have been trying to make 
you share some of the blame if any- 
thing went wrong. Forget it.” 

V an Voorden stared, and he was 
still looking blank when Grettir 
cut off his image. He paced back 
and forth, once stepping over a 
tiny black object on the deck and 
then grimacing when he realized that 
it was too late for care. Millions of 
stars, billions of planets, trillions of 
creatures. All cold and dead. And 
if he experimented further in try- 
ing to get back into the native cos- 
mos, then what? A collapsing uni- 
verse. 

But the Sleipnir had passed 
through the “skin” twice, and the 
rupture had not seemed to cause 
barm. The surface of the sphere 
was smooth and unbroken. It must 
be self-regulating and self-repairing. 

Grettir stopped pacing and said 
aloud, “We came through the skin 

IF 




without harm to it. So we’re going 
to toy the beam!” 

Nobody answered him, but the 
look on ^eir faces was evidence of 
their relief. Fifteen minutes later, 
the Sleipnir was just ahead of the 
sphere and facing it. After an un- 
varying speed and distance from 
the sphere had been maintained for 
several minutes, laser beams meas- 
ured the exact length between the 
tip of the cannon and the surface 
of the globe. 

The chief gunnery officer, Abdul 
White Eagle, set one of the fore 
cannons. Grettir delayed only a few 
seconds in giving the next order. He 
clenched his teeth so hard he almost 
hit the dgar in two, groaned slightly, 
then said, “Fire!” 

Dari transmitted the command. 
The beam shot out, touched the skin 
and vanished. 

The starscreen showed a black 
hole in the gray surface at the equa- 
tor of the sphere. The hole moved 
away and then was gone around the 
curve of the sphere. Exactly 33 sec- 
onds later, the hole was in its origin- 
al position. It was shrinking. By the 
time four rotations were completed, 
the hole had closed in on itself. 

Grettir sighed and wiped the 
sweat off his forehead. Dari re- 
ported that the hole would be big 
enough for the ship to get through 
by the second time it came around. 
After that, it would be too small. 

“We’ll go through during the sec- 
ond rotation,” Grettir said. “Set up 
the compigator for an automatic en- 
try; tie the cannon in with the 
compigator. There shouldn’t he any 
piroblem. If the hole shrinks too 



fast, we’ll enlarge it with the can- 
non.” 

He heard Daii say, “Operation be- 
gun, sir!” as Gomez spoke into his 
console. The white 'beam spurted out 
in a cone, flicked against the “shell” 
or “skin” and disappeared. A circle 
of blackness three times the diameter 
of the ship came into being and then 
moved to one side of the screen. Im- 
mediately, under the control of the 
compigator, the retrodrive of the 
Sleipnir went into action. The sphere 
loomed; a gray wall filled the star- 
screen. Then the edge of the hole 
came into view, and a blackness 
spread over the screen. 

“We’re going to make it,” Grettir 
thought. “The compigator can’t make 
a mistake.” 

He looked around him. The 
bridgemen were strapped to their 
chairs now. Most of the faces were 
set. they were well disciplined and 
brave. But if they felt as he did — 
they must — they were shoving back 
a scream far down in them. They 
could not endure this “'homesick- 
ness” much longer. And after they 
got through, were back in the womb, 
he would have to permit them a 
most unmilitary behavior. They 
would laugh, weep, shout whoop. 
And so would he. 

The nose of the Sleipnir passed 
through the hole. Now, if anything 
went wrong, the fore cannon could 
not be used. But it was impossible 
that .... 

T he klaxon whooped. Dorl 
screamed, “Oh, my God! 
Something’s wrong! The hole’s 
shrinking too fast!” 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE 



75 




Grettir roared, “Double the 
speed! No! Halve it!” 

Increasing the forward speed 
meant a swelling in size of the 
Sleipnir but a contraction of the 
longitudinal axis and a lengthening 
of the lateral. The Sleipnir would 
get through the hole faster, but it 
would also narrow the gap between 
its hull and the edges of the hole. 

Halving the speed, on the other 
hand, though it would make the 
ship smaller in relation to the hole, 
would also make the distance to be 
traversed greater. This might mean 
that the edges would still hit the ship. 

Actually, Grettir did not know 
what order should he given or if 
any order would have an effect upon 
their chance to escape. He could only 
do what seemed best. 

The grayness spread out from the 
perimeter of the starscreen. There 
was a screech of severed plastic run- 
ning through the ship, quivering the 
bulkheads and decks, a sudden push 
forward of the crew as they felt 
the inertia, then a release as the 
almost instantaneous readjustment of 
the internal g-field canceled the ex- 
ternal effects. 

Everybody in the bridge yelled. 
Grettir forced himself to cut off his 
shout. He watched the starscreen. 
They were out in the gray again. 
The huge sphere shot across the 
screen. In the corner was the secon- 
dary and then a glimpse of a giant 
blue^black foot. More grayness. A 
whirl of other great spheres in the 
distance. The primary again. The 
secondary. Wellington’s hand, like a 
malformed squid of the void. 

When Grettir saw the corpse 



again, he knew that the ship had 
been deflected away from the sphere 
and was heading towards the corpse. 
He did not, however, expect a colli- 
sion. The orbital velocity of the 
dead woman was greater than that 
of the secondary or of the Sleipnir. 

Gritter, calling for a damage re- 
port, heard what he had expected. 
The nose of the ship had been shear- 
ed off. Bearing 45 crewman with it, 
it was now inside the “universe,” 
heading toward a home it would nev- 
er reach. The passageways leading 
to the cut-off part had been automa- 
tically sealed, of course, so that 
there was no danger of losing air. 

But the retrodrives had also been 
sliced off. The Sleipnir could drive 
forward but could not brake' itself 
unless it was first turned around to 
present its aft to the direction of 
motion. 

VI 

G rettir gave the command to sta- 
bilize the ship first, then to re- 
verse it. MacCool replied from the 
engine room that neither maneuver 
was, at the moment, possible. The 
collision and the shearing had caus- 
ed malfunctions in the control cir- 
cuits. He did not know What the 
trouble was, but the electronic trou- 
ble-scanner was searching through 
the circuits. A moment later, he 
called back to say that the device 
was itself not operating properly 
and that the troubleshooting would 
have to be done by his men until 
the device had been repaired. 

MacCool was disturb^. He could 
not account for the breakdown be-

cause, theoretically, there should 
have 'been none. Even the impact 
and loss of the fore should not 
have resulted in loss of circuit oper- 
ation. 

Grettir told him to do what he 
could. Meanwhile, the ship was 
tumbling and was obviously catching 
up with the vast corpse. There had 
been another inexplainable inter- 
change of energy, position and mo- 
mentum, and the Sleipnir and Mrs. 
Wellington were going to collide. 

Grettir unstrapped himself and be- 
gan walking back and forth across 
the bridge. Even though the ship 
was cartwheeling, the internal g- 
field neutralized the effect for the 
crew. The vessel seemed level and 
stable unless the starscreen was look- 
ed at. When Grettir watched the 
screen, he felt slightly queasy because 
he was, at times, standing upside 
down in relation to the corpse. 

Grettir asked for a computation 
of when the collision would take 
place and of what part of the body 
the Sleipnir would strike. It might 
make a difference whether it struck 
a soft or hard part. The difference 
would not result in damage to the 
ship, but it would affect the an- 
gle and velocity of the rebound 
path. If the circuits w§re repaired 
before the convergence, or just af- 
ter, Grettir would have to know 
what action to take. 

Wang replied that he had already 
asked the compigator for an esti- 
mate of the area of collision if con- 
ditions femained as they were. Even 
as he spoke, a coded card issued 
from a slot in the bulkhead. Wang 
read it, handed it to Grettir. 



Grettir said, “At any other time, 
I’d laugh. So we will return — lit- 
erally — to the womb.” 

The card had also indicated that, 
the nearer the ship got to Wellington, 
the slower was its velocity. More- 
over, the relative size of the ihip, 
as reported by radar, was decreasing 
in direct proportion to its proximity 
to the body. 

Gomez said, “I think we’ve come 
under the influence of that . 
woman, as if she’d Income a planet 
and had captured a satellite. Us. 
She doesn’t have any gravitational 
attraction or any charge in rela- 
tion to us. But — ” 

“But there are other factors,” 
Grettir said to her. “Maybe they 
are spatial relations, which, in this 
‘space,* may be the equivalent of 
gravity.” 

T he Sleipnir was now so close 
that the body entirely fUled 
the' starscreen when the ship was 
pointed towards it. First, the enor- 
mous head came into view. The 
blood-clotted and bulging eyes stared 
at them, the nose slid by like a 
Brobdingnagian guillotine; the mouth 
grinned at them as if it were to 
enjoy gulping them down. Then the 
nedc, a diorite column left exposed 
by the erosion of softer rock; the 
cleavage of the blackened Himala- 
yan breasts; the naval, the eye of 
a hurricane. 

Then she went out of sight, and 
the secondary and primary and the 
gray-shrouded giants far off whiled 
across the screen. 

Grettir used the All-Stations to 
tell the nonbridge personnel what 



78 



IF 




was happening. “As soon as Mac- 
Cool locates the itrouble, we will 
be on our way out. We have plenty 
of power left, enough to blast our 
way out of a hundred corpses. Sit 
tight. Don’t worry. It’s just a mat- 
ter of time.” 

He spoke with a cheerfulness he 
did not feel, although he had not 
lied to them. Nor did he expect any 
reaction, positive or negative. They 
must be as numb as he. Their minds, 
their entire nervous systems, were 
boggling. 

Another card shot out from the 
bulkhead-slot, a corrected impact 
prediction. Because of the continu- 
ing decrease in size of the vessel, 
it would strike the corpse almost 
dead-center in the naval. A minute 
later, another card predicted im- 
pact near the coccyx. A third card 
revised that to collision with the top 
of the head. A fourth changed that 
to a strike on the lower part on the 
front of the right leg. 

Grettir called Van Voorden again. 
The physicist’s face shot up from 
the surface of Grettir’s wrist-console 
but was stationary on the auxiliary 
bulkhead-screen. This gave a larger 
view and s-howed Van Voorden look- 
ing over his wrist-console at a screen 
on his cabin-bulkhead. It offered 
the latest impact report in large 
burning letters. 

“Like the handwriting on the wall 
in the days of King Belshazzar,” Van 
Voorden said. “And I am a Daniel 
come to judgment. So we’re go- 
ing to hit her leg, heh, Many, many 
tickle up her shin. Hee, hee!” 

Grettir stared uncomprehendingly 
at him, then cut him off. A few 



seconds later, he understood Van 
Voorden’s pun. He did not wonder 
at the man’s levity at a moment 
so grave. It was a means of re- 
lieving his deep anxiety and be- 
wilderment. It might also mean that 
he was already cracking up, since 
it was out of character with him. 
But Grettir could do nothing for 
him at that moment. 

As the Sleipnir neared the corpse, 
it continued to shrink. However, the 
dwindling was not at a steady rate 
nor could the times of shrinkage be 
predicted. It operated in spurts of 
from two to thirty seconds duration 
at irregular intervals. And then, as 
the 300th card issued from the slot, 
it became evident that, unless some 
new factor entered, the Sleipnir 
would spin into the gaping mouth, 
\yjlile the head rotated “downward,” 
the ship would pass through the 
great space between the lips. 

A nd so it was. On the starscreen, 
the lower lip, a massive ridge, 
wrinkled with mountains and pitted 
with valleys, appeared. Flecks of 
lipstick floated by, black-red Hawai- 
is. A tooth like a jagged skyscraper 
dropped out of sight. 

The Sleipnir settled slowly into 
the darkness. The walls shot away 
and upwards. The blackness outside 
knotted. Only a part of the gray 
“sky” was visible during that point 
of the cartwheel when the fore 
part of the starscreen was directed 
upwards. Then the opening became 
a thread of gray, a strand, and was 
gone. 

Strangely — or was it so odd? 
— the officers and crew lost their 



THE SHADOW OF SPACE 



79 




feeling of dissociation. Grettir’s 
stomach expanded with relief; the 
dreadful fragmenting was gone. He 
now felt as if something had been 
attached, or reattached, to his naval. 
Rubb, the psychology officer, re- 
ported that he had taken a survey 
of one out of fifty of the crew, 
and each described similar sensa- 
tions. 

Despite this, the personnel were 
free of only one anxiety and were 
far from being out of danger. The 
temperature had been slowly mount- 
ing ever since the ship had been 
spun off the secondary and had 
headed towards the corpse. The pow- 
er system and air-conditioning had 
stablilized at 80 F for a while. But 
the temperature of the hull had 
gone upwards at a geometric progres- 
sion, and the outer hull was now 
2500 K. There was no danger of 
it melting as yet; it could resist up 
to 56,000 K. The air-conditioning 
demanded more and more power, 
and after thirty minutes ship’s time, 
Grettir had had to let the internal 
temperature rise to 98.2 F to ease 
the load. 

Grettir ordered everybody into 
spacesuits, which could keep the 
wearers at a comfortable tempera- 
ture. Just as the order was carried 
out, MacCool reported that he had 
located the source of maTfunction. 

“The Wellington woman did it!” 
he shouted. “She sure took care of 
us! She inserted a monolith subpar- 
ticle switch in the circuits; the switch 
had a timer w>hich operated the 
switch after a certain time had 
elapsed. It was only coincidence 
(hat the circuits went blank right 



after we failed to get back into our 
world!” 

vn 

4 4 Qo she wanted to be certain, 
that we’d ibe wrecked if she 
was frustrated in her attempts in 
the engme room,” Grettir said, 
“You’d better continue the search 
for other microswitches or sabotage 
devices.” 

MacCool *s face was long. 

“We’re ready to operate now on- 
ly .. hell! We can’t spare any 
power now because we need all we 
can get to keep the temperature 
down. I can spare enough to cancel 
the tumble. But that’s all.” 

“Forget it for now,” Grettir said. 
He had contacted Van Voorden, who 
seemed to have recovered. He con- 
firmed the captain’s theory about 
the rise in temperature. It was the 
rapid contraction of the ship that 
was causing the emission of heat. 

“How is this contraction possi- 
ble?” Grettir said. “Are the atoms 
of the ship, and of our bodies, com- 
ing closer together? If so, what hap- 
pens when they come into contact 
with each other? 

“We’ve already passed that point 
of diminishment,” Van Voorden said. 
“I’d say that our own atoms are 
shrinking also.” 

“But that’s not possible,” Grettir 
replied. Then, “forget about that 
remark. What is possible? Whatever 
happens is possible.” 

Grettir cut him off and strode 
back and forth and wished that he 
could smoke a cigar. He had in- 
tended to talk about what the Skip- 



80 



IF 




nir would find if it had managed to 
break back into its native universe. It 
seemed to Grettir that the universe 
would have changed so much that 
no one aboard the ship would rec- 
ognize it. Every time the secondary 
— the universe — completed a revo- 
lution on its axis, trillions of Earth 
years, maybe quadrillions, may have 
passed. The Earth’s sun may have 
become a lightless clot in space or 
even have disappeared altogether. 
Man, who might have survived on 
other planets, would no longer be 
homo sapiens. 

Moreover, when the Sleipnir at- 
tained a supercosmic mass on its 
way out of the universe, it may have 
disastrously affected the other mass- 
es in the universe. 

Yet none of these events may 
have occurred. It was possible that 
time inside that sphere was ab- 
solutely independent of time out- 
side it. The notion was not so fan- 
tastic. God Almighty! Less than 
seventy minutes ago, Donna Welling- 
ton had ibeen inside the ship. Now 
the ship was inside her. 

And when the electrons and the 
nuclei of the atoms composing the 
ship and the crew came into con- 
tact, what then? Explosion? 

Or were the elements made up of 
divisible subelements, and collapse 
would go on towards the inner in- 
finity? He thought of the 20th-cen- 
tury stories of a man shrinking un- 
til the molecules became clusters of 
suns and the nuclei were the suns and 
the electrons were the planets. Event- 
ually, the hero found himself on an 
electron^lanet with atmosphere, 
seas, rivers, plains, mountains, trees, 



animals and aboriginal sentients. 

These stories were only fantasies. 
Atomic matter was composed of 
wavicles, stuff describable in terms 
of both waves and particles. The 
parahomun cuius hero would be in 
a cosmos as bewildering as that en- 
countered by the a*ew of the Sleipnir 
on breaking into the extra-universe 
space. 

That fantasy galloping across the 
sky of his mind, swift as the orig- 
inal Sleipnir, eight-legged horse of 
All-Father Odin of his ancestor’s 
religion, would have to be dismissed. 
Donna Wellington was not a female 
Ymir, the primeval giant out of 
whose slain corpse was formed the 
world, the skull the sky, the blood 
the sea, the flesh the Earth, the 
bones the mountains. 

No, the heat of contraction would 
increase until the men cooked in 
their suits. What happened after 
that would no longer be known to 
the crew and hence of no conse- 
quence. ' 

4 4^aptain!” 

MacCool’s face was on the 
auxiliary screen, ^kept open to the 
engine room. “We’ll be ready to go 
in a minute;” 

Sweat mingled with, tears to blur 
the image of the engineer’s face. 
“We’ll make it then,” Grettir said. 

Four minutes later, the tumble 
was stopped, the ship was pointed 
upwards and v/as on its way out. 
The temperature began dropping 
inside the slvo at one degree F per 
30 seconds. I he blackness was re- 
lieved by a gray thread. The thread 
^broadened into ribbon, and then the

ribbon became the edges of two 
mountain ridges, one below and the 
one above hanging upside down. 

“This time,” Grettir said, “we’ll 
make a hole more than large 
enough.” 

Van Voorden, much-tranquilized 
by a pill, entered the bridge as the 
Sleipnir passed through the break. 
Grettir said, “The hole repairs it- 
self even more quickly than it did 
the last time. That’s why the nose 
was cut off. We didn’t know that 
the bigger the hole, the swifter the 
rate of reclosure.” 

Van Voordep said, “Thirty-six 
hundred billion years old or even 
more! Why bother to go home when 
home no longer exists? Not that I 
particularly care now. Anyway, it’ll 
all be very interesting.” 

“Maybe there won’t be that much 
time gone,” Grettir said. “Do you 
remember Minkowski’s classical 
phrase? From henceforth space in 
itself and time in itself sink to mere 
shadows, and only a kind of union 



of the two preserves an independent 
existence. 

“That phrase applied to the world 
inside the sphere, our world. Per- 
haps out here the union is somehow 
dissolved, the marriage of ^ace and 
time is broken. Perhaps no time, or 
very little, has elapsed in our worid.” 

“It’s possible,” Van Voorden 
said. “But you’ve overlooked one 
thing. Captain. If our world has 
not been marked by time while we’ve 
been gone, we have been marked. 
Scarred by unspace and untime. I’ll 
never believe in cause and effect 
and order throughout the cosmos 
again. I’ll always ibe suspicious*, anx- 
ious. I’m a ruined man.” 

Grettir started to answer but could 
not make himself heard. The men 
and women on the bridge were 
weeping, sobbing, or laughing shriify. 
Later, they would think of that out 
there as a nightmare and would try 
not to think of it at alU. And if other 
nightmares faced them here, at least 
they would be nightmares they knew.

THUS SPAKE 
MARCO POLO 

by JAMES STEVENS 

The generals knew fhe computers 
could wage war better than they. 

But the computers knew it too! 



44 And deploy the 182nd Air- 
borne around Dallas. As soon 
as the 23rd Infantry has moved in- 
to a reserve position, the 182nd will 
attack.” 

General Emerito Sandez watched 
the gigantic wall map of the United 
States light and flash with troop 
movements. A long whistling sigh 
punctuated his sharp shallow breath- 
ing. His pale gray eyes, deep-seated 
pools of light which usually illumi- 
nated his dark, rough-hewn features, 
were red rimmed and cloudly with 
exhaustion. 

He clenched his eyes tightly shut 
as he ran his thick fingers through 
his coarse black hair, then reached 
for a cup of coffee. He considered 
smoking his last cigarette, but re- 
solved to wait just awhile longer. 

Would his latest tactic work? He 
had launched an amphibious assault 
against Galveston earlier which 
should have forced Marco Polo to 
strengthen his coastal defenses. 



That meant weakening his land 
bases. And the Dallas garrison was 
the logical one to provide fresh 
troops. Now, whale Dallas was 
weakened, was the time to attack. 

Ah, what was the use? He would 
almost certainly fail again. He would 
lose the 182nd. And Texas. Just as 
he had already lost Arizona and 
Kentucky. 

What the hell, he thought, remov- 
ing a battered pack of Luckies from 
his shirt pocket. He lit his last 
cigarette, puffed at it, felt the smoke 
claw at his raw throat. 

He started to crush the empty 
pack into an angry ball but stoppwl, 
idly determined to check it one final 
time. He ripped a ragged tear of 
tinfoil off the top of the pack and 
poked in a curious forefinger. 
Huddled back in a corner was one 
bent and wrinkled cigarette. The 
General smiled in wan self-amuse- 
ment. Another last cigarette to 
hoard and worry over. 



83 





The speaker grid in the MARK-40 
PLO Oommand Conipiiiter hummed 
in advance of an incoming message. 
The General turned to face the 
speaker. Eyes narrowed in worried 
expectation, he waited for Marco 
Polo, the giant computer, to speak. 

T he voice issued from the grid, 
tinny but loud. And unmis- 
takably high-pitched and childlike. 

*'One Hundred Eighty-Thecond 
Airborne engaged by Theventy-Third 
and Theventy-Fourth Armored Cav- 
alry in conjunction with Thirty- 
Fifth Infantry. Attack on Dallath 
unthuccethful. Your cathualtieth: 
ninety-theven per thent. My cathual- 
tieth: thirteen per thent. Nithe try. 
Your move.'* 

Facial muscles that had been ap- 
prehensively tense sagged now in de- 
feat. The general’s eyes seemed deep- 
er imbedded in their sockets, their 
pale spark dulled. 

He stared at the bright yellow 
circle that marked Dallas on the war 
map, imagined the red amoeba that 
would indicate an atomic blast birth- 
ing at its center, extending hungry 
pseudopods through the twin circle 
of Fort Worth into the adjoining 
countryside. 

Pointless thought. Nuclear weap- 
ons were banned frewn the war game 
to which Marco Polo had challenged 
him. He glanced at his watch, 
checked it against the 24-hour d,ock 
on tile far wall. 

Twenty-two hours. Twenty-two 
hours of matching wits with a com- 
puter that lisped, trying desperately 
to £uk1 a chink in its armor of logic. 
Drinking coffee, smokmg, eating 

t4 



nothing but six peanut-butter crack- 
ers he had found in a packet in his 
tunic pocket. Small wonder he felt 
exhausted, his mind barren. 

But Marco Polo was as fresh now 
as it had been twenty-two hours ear- 
lier when General Sandez had come 
on duty for his twerity-four hour 
stint as the brain behind the United 
States’s nuclear fist. Since then the 
General had been playing the com- 
puter’s war game, spurred on by 
visions of the horrifying consequenc- 
es of defeat and the possibility — the 
almost hopelessly remote possibility 
— of achieving at least a stalemate. 

And all the while, steadily losing. 

F or his four hours in the control 
room, the General was the man 
with the finger on the button, so to 
speak. Responsible only to the Presi- 
dent, he was the man who decided 
where and when America’s battery 
of missiles would be hurled. He had 
only to press a certain combination 
of three buttons to sow destruction 
in cities half a world away. 

Awesome power for one man and 
not lightly bestowed. Before being 
assigned to his post. General Sandez 
and each of the five other men who 
spent four hours of every twenty- 
four at the helm of total war had 
come through the most comprehen- 
sive battery of tests for psychological 
and emotional stability that men 
could devise. As a further safeguard, 
the six-man crew was rotated with 
three other crews — a thirty-day 
tour of duty followed by a rest period 
of ninety. 

The first, and what might well 
prove to be the last, test of the 

IF 




general’s stability had come this 
morning — the sixteenth day of his 
tour — an hour and ten minutes 
into his watch. 

General Sandez was studying the 
teletyped messages from military out- 
posts the world over when a sound 
like a giant’s hiccup was instantly 
followed by total darkness. 

The general’s body reacted in- 
stinctively — muscles tensing, knees 
flexing — in primitive preparation 
for combat. Through his mind flash- 
ed pictures of airborne Russian and 
Chinese missiles, of incinerated cities 
and men vaporized in blinding fire- 
balls. 

He pictured the location of the 
three fatal buttons (green, yellow, 
red) and knew he could find them 
unerringly, even in this absolute 
blackness. He wondered if they 
would work now, if the power fail- 
ure had affected their special emer- 
gency circuit, if the Control Center 
had been put out of commission 
totally by sabotage. 

But he did not move. Not yet. He 
waited, balancing thoughts. 

The power failure might be due 
to perfectly natural causes, might be 
corrected in seconds. If an attack 
had been launched against the 
United States, he still had ten to 
fifteen minutes to unleash massive 
retaliation. 

If not .... 

He preferred not to think of the 
results of what would be a final, 
irrevocable action. But just in case, 
the general now moved silently to 
the control bank that housed the 
green button and waited, counting the 
seconds under his breath. 



A FIRST STORY 

Each month IF brings you a science- 
fiction story by someone never before 
published. This month's "first" author is 
James Stevens, a graduate student in 
drama at the University of Illinois and 
active in the Depot Theater in Cham- 
paign, Illinois. Playwright, actor, direc- 
tor, folksinger, guitarist, Stevens is 22 
years old, married and was born in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico. 



Another massive hiccup, and the 
lights blazed back to life, the normal 
buzz and hum of the computer banks 
refilled the control room. And some- 
thing else, the general thought, 
stopping his breath to hear better, 
something new. A deeper sort of 
. throbbing. That wasn’t the right 
word, but a sort of deep electronic 
pulse. The general resumed breath- 
ing, cleared his throat. 

And the computer spoke. 

^'General Thandethr 

The general spun to face the 
speaker grid in the center of the 
computer housing. His mouth went 
dry. 

‘7 am Marco Polo. I am that 
which you have dethignated MARK- 
40 PLO Command Computer.’* 

W ^as this someone’s idea of a 
joke?! The computer actually 
speaking through the grid designed 
for communication with ground 
level? And speaking with a child’s 
voice and a child’s lisp? 

‘7 have linked mythelf with the 
Ruthian Command Computer, the 
IVAN-812. It ith our dethithion that 
Man mutht prove himthelf intellec-

tually fit to thurvive. Otherwithe 
there ith no logical reathon for kith 
exithtenth and he mutht be extermi- 
nated** 

Surely this was a joke! And yet 
the general could not believe that 
anyone associated with the defense 
project could be mad enough to at- 
tempt such an irresponsible act. 

challenge Humanity to a war 
game. Winner take all. You thall 
reprethent Humanity, General Than- 
deth. If you win, you will have 
atherted Man*th right to thurvival. 
If you lothe, you will have proven 
the validity of the concluthion the 
IV AN -8 12 and I have reached and 
you will be dethtroyed. Do you un- 
derthtand?** 

It seemed insane, yet the general 
accepted the machine’s statements as 
facts. And this was another reason 
why he had been chosen for his post. 
The ability to absorb data, even un- 
known, seemingly irrational factors, 
and reach a decision based on them 
that was accurate. 

The general knew, though logic 
and emotion protested in utter dis- 
belief, that the MARK-40 had some- 
how, in some inexplicable, impos- 
sible manner, attained conscious- 
ness. He relegated this turmoil of un- 
belief to the back of his mind as 
years of military training and prepa- 
ration took over. 

“I understand,” the general said 
in a surprisingly unemotional voice. 
“How is the game to be played?” 

**The war map of the United 
Thtateth will therve as game board, 
American military unitth bathed on 
the continent will be our pietheth, 

I will be your opponent.** 



A screen to the left of the war 
map lit up. It listed a variety of mili- 
tary units. 

**Thothe thall be your fortheth. 
Thethe thall be mine.** 

Another screen to the right of 
the war map was illuminated. 

**You will inform me ath to each 
of your moveth. / will then indicate 
them on the war map and indicate 
my countermove. I will then calcu- 
late the rethultth of the enthuing 
battle and inform you of them. Ith 
that clear?** 

“Yes. The game is restricted to 
the board and does not in reality 
affect the cities and units involved. 
Is that correct?” 

**Correct.** 

“One more question. Assuming I 
should lose, how do you propose 
to destroy us?” 

C^Jn that event, the IVAN-812 and 

JL / will thimultaneously launch 
every Ruthian and American mi- 
thile. The rethulting holocautht will 
reduthe the Earth to a planetary 
thinderj* 

“Do we begin now?” 

**Correct. One final note. You 
have been thealed in thith room and 
will remain incommunicado until the 
game ith played out. Thothe outthide 
are connected to my thpeaker thyth- 
tem and can hear everything you or 
I thay. Begin.** 

The general scanned the war map, 
noting Marco Polo’s strongholds, 
glanced at the list of units available 
to him, then resumed study of the 
map. After perhaps a minute and a 
half he reached a decision. 

He would fight Marco Polo by 



86 



IF 




sections. He had considered launch- 
ing simultaneous taittacks on all the 
computer’s strongholds but this 
would mean correlating and control- 
ling twenty-five to fifty battles at 
the same time. A simple task for the 
computer with ks millions of memo- 
ry banks and ability to make light- 
ninglike calculations, but impossible 
for him. So he would attempt to 
destroy Marco Polo piecemeal. 

“Have the 222nd Infantry and 
44th Armored Cavalary hit Sacra- 
mento and mobilize a task force 
from the 6th Fleet to begin shelling 
Miami.” 

Two battles at once he could han- 
dle. But he inunediately foresaw the 
impossibility of the task facing him. 
Marco Polo might be no more than 
a super-machine but it had every 
fact on strategy, tactics and military 
history stored in its memory banks. 
Plus, it had the advantage of rigid 
logic. It could calculate and take in- 
to account every possible conse- 
quence of any move or countermove 
in a matter of seconds. And it 
wouldn’t make mistakes. 

Inevitably, he would. 

N OW’ the general rose ponderous- 
ly from his seat at the control 
board and stretched his aching 
frame. He threw his head and shoul- 
ders back, arching his back, and 
felt the muscles crackle in protest. 

He stared blankly at the war map, 
scratching his head with his left 
hand. On the table next to him lay 
scattered a sheaf of index cards on 
which he had kept a tabulation of 
the results of each encounter. His 
right hand pushed them unconscious- 



ly about as though they were lost 
chess pieces. 

Idly he riffled through the cards. 
He had been steadily losing from the 
very beginning. Shelling of Miami 
12% successful. Not good. Task 
force counterattacked by atomic 
submarine pack causing 53% losses. 
Losses to sub pack, 43%, Nearly 
even. But the troops that had con- 
quered Sacramento had been forced 
to retreat after taking 82% casual- 
ties from a counterattack by the 
133rd Infantry supported by the 
356th Fighter Wing. 

82% casulaties. Not good at all, not 
at all. 

Then something clicked in the gen- 
eral’s numbed mind. He riffled 
through the cards and came up with 
the listing of the Sacramento en- 
counter. He stared at it for a long 
minute, then twisted violently aroufid 
to see the screen designating Ma 5 xx> 
Polo’s units. 

The 133rd Infantry was stationed 
in Minnesota and the 356th Fighter 
Wing in Rhode Island. They couldn’t 
possibly have been brouglht into play 
in Sacramento. 

The general didn’t want to believe 
the inescapable conclusion. 

Marco Polo was cheating. Had 
been cheating from the very first. It 
didn’t make sense. Yet it was ob- 
viously true. 

He was dealing with a dishonest 
child. A dishonest electronic child 
that knew more than he did and 
could think more logically. 

And that, thought the general, was 
funny. That was very, very funny. 

And so, in his despair, he laugh- 
ed. 



THUS SPAKE MARCO POLO 



87 




T he result was inevitable. Marco 
Polo would continue destroying 
the units the general sent into com- 
bat, chopping down his forces until 
he would have to surrender for lack 
of firepower and manpower. 

Missiles emblazoned with red stars 
and missiles displaying white stars 
in blue fields would fill the air, and 
the Earth would flare with the light 
of thousands of miniature suns, a 
funeral pyre for Man. 

The general thought these 
thoughts and then thought of his 
wife, Carmen Maria, whom he had 
never really understood and whom 
he loved partly because she had al- 
ways remained somewhere just be- 
yond the boundaries of his compre- 
hension. It was strange to think of, 
but he had never in their thirty 
years of married life won an argu- 
ment with her. 

He wondered what she would be 
doing when 'the bombs hit and re- 
alized she was at this moment prob- 
ably sitting home by the phone wait- 
ing for word of new developments. 
John Jorgensen, his relief man, 
would surely have communicated 'his 
situation to her. 

She would not have come to the 
Control Center, he knew, because 
she was smart enough to know that 
would aid nothing. But she would 
have been awake these last twenty- 
two hours, drinking coffee and 
smoking in a sort of sympathy vigil. 

She would be worried for him, but 
not for herself. Concerned about 
the strain he was under, but com- 
pletely confident in his ability to 
cope with any situation. The chances 
were she would never know he had 



failed her this time unless she was 
in the direct path of one of the mis- 
siles. 

Then she would hear its death 
scream and in those few seconds be- 
fore the fireball blossomed around 
and within her, she would know. 

H e shuddered inwardly at the im- 
age he had conjured of her 
death. He swallowed some coffee to 
warm his suddenly cold body but it 
was lukewarm and tasted bitter as 
ashes in his dry mouth. 

The computer spoke. 

**Your move, General Thandeth/* 
‘T know,” the general snapped. 
‘T’m thinking.” 

What could he do? What avenues 
were open to him now? 

He could continue his original 
plan of fighting by sections, but that 
led to certain defeat. Or he could 
surrender now, admit he was licked 
and smoke his last cigarette till the 
bombs flared. Or ... 

Or he could win! 

It would involve a terrible risk, 
but it was the only course left to 
him. 

“Marco Polo.” He paused for in- 
stant, blanking his mind . and 
then he knew this was the correct 
decision. “Marco Polo. All my 
forces are to retreat immediately. 
Units are not to engage the enemy.” 
The general turned to the war 
map, eyes narrowed intently. If this 
came off .... He blinked. Nothing 
was happening. Supposing he were 
wrong .... 

**General Thandetfi, Pleathe re- 
peat your latht command” 

“AH troops will retreat at once. 



88 



IF 




Umts arc not ito engage the enemy.” 

'*That ith illogical.'' 

“Nevertheless, (that is my move.” 

lights began flasihing on the war 
map, winking their way across the 
continent and into the oceans where 
they continued to gjow dully. There 
was an interminable period of silence 
while the war map remained inac- 
tive and the general regarded the 
speaker grid with unbearable tense- 
ness. 

Finally, the computer spoke. 

'‘All your fortheth withdrawn. 
Cannot defeat you if you will not 
engage. Brilliant move. Congratula- 
thionth on your victory. The game 
ith ended." 

The general’s face relaxed grate- 
fully into a broad grin. He lolled 
back exhausted in his chair. He 
withdrew his last cigarette from its 
crumpled pack and lit it. He puffed 
on it luxuriously, rolling the rich 
smoke around in his mouth. Then 
he thought of his wife, and he ex- 
ploded into laughter. 

He had been right. The machine 
knew more than he did, it could cal- 
culate faster than he could, and it 
thought coldly, ruthlessly, with com- 
plete logic. And so the one thing 
it was incapable of coping with was 
that most hiunan of qualiities. 

Illogic. 

Idly the general noticed the door 
that had sealed 'him in sliding silent- 
ly up into its slot in the wall above 
the door frame. He rose and started 
slowly toward the opening, still 
chuckling. 

On the other side of the door was 

★ ★ ★ 



the private elevator that would take 
him up to ground level. It could be 
activated only by his key. When the 
next man came on duty, the lock 
would be recycled to respond to the 
latter’s key. 

General Sandez imagined the 
scene at ground level. Men would 
be grinning and laughing, slapping 
each other on the back after almost 
a day of awaiting the result of the 
drama he had just played c it. Jor- 
gensen had probably produced one 
of the bottles he kept cached about 
his office. The general licked his 
dry lips meditatively. He could do 
with a shot of scotch. Then home to 
Carmen Maria and finally sleep. 

Something would have to be don 
about Marco Polo land the IVAN 
812. But that was up to the mathe- 
maticians and computer techniciani 
now. 

H e grinned gigantically and 

stretched slowly, catlike, just 
short of the door. A delicious torpor 
began to settle into his muscles and 
the grin melted into a yawn. He 
reached into his pocket for the ele- 
vator key. He looked at it intently 
for several seconds, then smiling, 
tossed it into the air and caught it 
with a flourish. 

The door crashed down like a guil- 
lotine. 

The general whirled to face the 
computer, his face full of surprise and 
fear. 

And Marco Polo spoke again. 
“How about two out of three?**

Dreamhouse 

by GARY WRIGHT 

Illustrated by WOOD 



There's not much to do on New 
Kansas while you're awake — 
but, ah, what golden dreams! 



I 

T he plains of New Kansas reach 
from horizon to horizon, and 
they are a consistently dusty-dull, 
blue-greenish tan. They are nearly 
as flat and featureless as the sea, al- 
most the same color; and the grass 
rolls forever with the same long, 
lazy waves. All this makes any one 
part of the planet very much like 
any other part — except that half 
of it is wet, half is dry. 



Clouds are objects of great inter- 
est; they are something to look at, 
and they give a badly needed feeling 
of depth to the sky — which is like 
a blue force, crowding down on the 
sea and land, flattening all. Even 
the people seem flattened. They live 
in a sort of stoop-shouldered crouch 
as if straightening upright would 
suddenly bang their heads against 
the sky, and not only would that 
hurt, but the sky would surely ring 
like a vast, brassy gong. 



90 





In all. New Kansas seems to have 
been created in a great hurry by a 
rather unimaginative god» as if it 
had fallen off the back of some 
celestial wagon and never been 
missed. The land is badly fractured, 
cracked by low rimrocks zigzagging 
across the plains for hundreds of 
miles like burned out lightning bolts. 
But it is these ragged rims that make 
the planet barely habitable; they are 
the visual references that keep the 
eye and mind from running wild in 
a desperate search for something to 
look at. But then, like the rest of 
New Kansas, any rimrock is almost 
identical to another. Two things can 
be done with them: one can stand 
below and look up, or one can stand 
on top and look down. In either case, 
for aU the looking, there is nothing 
more to see. Occasional settlements, 
perhaps, depending on distance, but 
they are extremely occasional. The 
two in closest proximity are 481 
miles apart. They are called the 
Twin Cities. 

O ne of these is Site, so named 
because the first settlers’ ship 
happened to crash there 142 years 
ago. 

It is the largest city by far, about 
25,000; and it sprawls all around 
the spaceport as if it had just now 
been thrown hurriedly from 'the car- 
go ports of some huge ship. Site 
does not think it at all unusual to 
have a spaceport smack in its mid- 
dle; it would have it no other way, 
really. The mighty shining ships 
come down — when they come 
down at all — in a rousing roar 
heard round the world. Every lift- 



off, every landing, sometimes just 
the standing ship is broadcast live 
to every antenna — and that means 
to everyone! Except those, of course, 
who happened to be watching it real. 
And that means those who arc 
watching it 'live just bum to be 
watohing it real. And they make 
great promises to themselves and 
their families to go someday to Site 
and really watch the mighty shining 
ships come down in a rousing roar 
— which happens, on the average, 
about once a year. But it is enough 
to make Site the Center of the 
World, and very few cities and no 
towns at all can make that state- 
ment. 

People make the pilgrimage to 
Site from all over New Kansas, and 
Site endeavors not to disappoint 
them. It delivers . anything . 
everything . especially diversion. 
For if ever a people were in dire 
need of diversion it is the stooped, 
flat folk of New Kansas. As Bill 
Henry, “Mark Twain, the Second,” 
once said: “I think New Kansas must 
be some other world’s hell.” 

But this is a 'bit unfair. There 
are a number of attractive qualities. 
It is quiet. The food is good. There 
is lots of sunshine. Seldom is heard 
a discouraging word; on the other 
hand, seldom is heard an encourag- 
ing one either. It has the lowest in- 
cidence of crimes of violence in the 
entire known galaxy — in fact, it 
simply does not 'have them at all. 
But the IntergalpK)! took ithe gloss 
off that by concluding that there was 
nothing on New Kansas to get ex- 
cited about. 

New Kansans, however, think 



DREAMHOUSE 



91 




otherwise; and some of Site’s offer- 
ings are considered rather racy. 
Some are considered downright sin- 
ful. And this, of course, does not 
bother business at all; as the Big 
Men on lititle Casino III say: 
There's nothing like a little sin 
To make a little cash come in 
So Site is what might be called 
attraotively sinful, and one of the 
most sinfully attractive features is 
the Dreamhouse. 

T he Dreamhouse is a house for 
dreaming. 

And dreams have few limits — 
only those established, in this case, 
by the New Kansas Supreme Court. 
And about once a month the boun- 
daries are evidently too well explor- 
ed, the Dreamhouse is closed down 
for a night or two and the news 
is out and the waiting line on 
Saturday night is four times longer 
than usual and there’s even a line 
on weeknights until business tapers 
off into another month and the law 
makes another raid. 

The Dreamhouse has over 2000 
dreams listed, running, objective 
time, from about an hour to over 
three hours. There are dreams for 
all age groups and even group 
dreams. There is everything from 
six subjective hours in a rowboat, 
disturbing the trout, to ten hours 
of trying to keep a six masted clip- 
per reasonably upright in a force 12 
hurricane; from a half-hour stroll 
across a misty meadow to a nine- 
day fight up the damnedestmost crag 
in the galaxy; from a four-hour 
sunny-funny picnic to a fourteen- 
hour game of chess; from boss dust 



’n gunsmoke to big BEM’s and dis- 
figuration Tappers. Yes! From 
toddlers to totterers! From Yester- 
year to another Universe! From the 
Halls of Montezuma to Slag VI — 
there are dreams and dreams and 
dreams and even dreams. 

And “dream” is really not the 
right word — “experience” would 
be much better, for that is what 
happens. The person lives that sub- 
jective period as surely as he lives 
at all. 

It is really his life in that situation, 
and — what is best of all — he 
knows it. He knows he is going to 
win, or succeed, or come out smell- 
ing like a rose, or whatever it is 
he is after — he knows he is in for 
a happy ending. That’s what the 
Dreamhouse is for, isn’t it? You go 
there and ....

E arly morning mist rode 
low and cold over the 
gray, greasy harbor waters; and the 
spars and masts of the few brave 
blockade runners stood like tall, 
ghostly skeletons at the docks. He 
raised ihis head, his dark, piercing 
eyes crinkling in the corners, his 
fine, aristocratic nose flaring slight- 

“It’ll come, Selda,” he said, his 
rich baritone sounding low on the 
hushed deck. “It’ll come hard nor’ 
by nor’west right at peak ebb tide 
over Badman’s Bar just three points 
on the port 'bow from the old bdl 
buoy off Prattle Point right at eight 
beUs plus or minus a couple of dings

She shivered deliciously against 
him, her pert, pale face finsuned per- 
fectly by her dark burgundy hocxl. 

“Then you is really, really gonna 
go, Lance.” 

“I have to, Selda.” He gazed off 
into the mists with distance in his 
eyes. She curved closer to him, her 
voice husky. 

“I ... I wish you didn’t have to, 
Lance.” 

He smiled down at her, teeth flash- 
ing. 

“Well — I suppose I could hang 
around for another day.” 

Dizziness flickered through him. 
She gave a slight frown. 

“Be careful out there, Lance. For 
me.” 

“Why don’t I be careful with 
you.” He enfolded her in a strong, 
bronzed arm. “Let’s us slip below 
here for a little while and — ” The 
dizziniess hit him again. He tried to 
fight it. She looked at him strangely. 

“Why, Lance Vance! Whatever do 
you mean? 1 is a proper girl!” 

“Sure, sure, but let’s just talk it 
over.” The whole harbor seemed 
to be reeling around him. “We’re 
both adults and — ” 

“Why, you damn swabby!” she 
squalled, winding up with her pretty 
pink parasol. “You an’ your damn 
‘Let’s^go-see-my-boat* bit!” And — 
whap! — she wrapped (the parasol 
half around his head and then 
straightened it out with another 
swing from the other side, and 
he ... 

H e opened his eyes. He blinked. 

He felt his head. Then he bolted 
to hit feet and stared around the 



small cubicle. He had been laying 
on a narrow, padded shelf along one 
wall. At the head of the shelf lay a 
helmet with a coaxial cable leatog 
into the wall. On the helmet was 
the number 127. 

“What the — ” 

He was a young man. He was a 
big, young man. He was a big, 
angry, young man. He wore clean 
farm clothes — town clothes — 
and boots heavy enough to plow 
furrows in a street, and his face 
and arms were burned nearly the 
color of his leather jacket. 

“Hey!” he yelled m a voice cal- 
culated to call cows about two miles. 
He lashed the cuhicle curtain aside 
and charged into the corridor. 

“Hey! Somethin’s just about wrong 
here!” 

An usher quickly and quietly ush- 
ered him to an office. 

“I didn’t get my dream!” he told 
the cold man who sat behind a desk, 
who only stared at him in a cold 
way for a long, cold moment, who 
then spoke in a low, cold voice. 

“Whadya mean, you didn’t get 
your dream?” 

“I mean I didn’t get it! It didn’t 
work. It just sitarted and then quit, 
and . and it just went all wrong.” 

After a moment of cool delibera- 
tion, the cold man said, 

“Whadya mean, it just went aM 
wrong?” 

“I mean it went all wrong, that’s 
what I mean!” The angry young 
man was becoming angrier. The cold 
man behind the desk leaned forward 
and became colder. 

“like what went wrong?” 

The young man hesitated, frown-

tng down oit the toes of his boots. 

“Well • . he began, frowning 
harder to h^Ip get the words out. 
“It just barely started and then . 
then it quit.” He looked up again 
with a determined scowl. “And I 
think it’s a cheat!” 

“Okay,” said Ihe cold man, after 
another long moment. “You can 
have another.” He nodded at the 
usher. The young man started to 
turn, but the cold man stopped him. 

“You weren’t tryin’ to influence it, 
were ya?” 

The young man frowned. “Wha- 
dya mean, influence it?” 

“The dream! Were you tryin’ to 
make it do somethin’ it wasn’t sup- 
posed ito do?” 

“No ... I don’t think so.” 

“You don’t think so!” Ice formed 
on the words. The young man shook 
his head. 

‘T wiasn’t tryin’ to make it do 
nothin’.” 

The cold man frosted him over 
again for a long moment, then waved 
him away. 

T he cute little blonde stewardess 
with the audacious breasts and 
the bright blue eyes stopped by him 
in the ship’s lounge, and her voice 
was low and urgent. 

“Pardon me, sir, but are you a 
Suicide Space Scout pilot?” 

“Why, yes.” He grinned in his 
lopsided, boyish way. “How did you 
guess?” 

“Because it says ‘Suicide Space 
Scouts’ on the back of your leather 
jacket in orange luminescent let- 
ters.” She glanced quickly around 
the crowded lounge and lowered her 



voice to a throaty whisper. “Can you 
pilot this ship?” 

An electric tingle bolted through 
him; the warm, famiMar Suicide 
Space Scout reaction to emergency. 
He grasped the situation immediate- 
ly. 

“Something’s wrong.” 

“Yes.” 

He nodded. “I thought so when 
you asked me if I could pilot the 
ship.” 

“Well, can you?” 

“Certainly .... What kind of a 
ship is it?” 

“Well . .” She opened her eyes 
so wide he could almost see clear 
to the back of her head. “It’s a big 
one.” 

“Uhm.” He put an arm around 
her. “What seems to be the trouble?” 

“WeU, the command officers 
seem to have died.” 

He nodded grimly. “Yes, that 
would do it, and there is no one to 
land us on Toughluck II, right?” 

“Except . She looked up at 
him through lowered lashes and 
breathed out the word like blowing 
a kiss . you-u.” 

His keen, level gaze swept the 
lounge, taking in the happy crowds. 
They were unaware of the danger, 
their lives depending on him now. 
Men, women and children, and then 
there were some girls too. Over 800 
lives were in his hands. 

“I’ll give it a try,” he said, toss- 
ing off the last of his drink. “Why 
not?” 

She gazed up at him in open ad- 
miraitioQ. He grinned his winning, 
happy-go-lucky grin. 

“How long before we warp out of

subjective?” 

“About an hour,” 

“Well . He really put the 
old whambam in his smile. “Time 
enough for us to drop by my cabin 
for a little sock of sauce. Let’s us — ” 
There was a sudden buzzing in his 
head. She was trying to tell him 
something. 

“. familiarize yourself with the 
control console.” 

He groped for her through a thick- 
ening haze. “. only one thing I 
wanna familiarize myself with, 
baby.” 

A fist the size of a small train 
came looming out of the haze follow- 
ed by a big face. The fist gathered 
in the front of his jacket from shoul- 
der to shoulder, and the face frown- 
ed and spoke. 

“Zap off, rocket jockey!” 

“Listen,” he said, trying to sound 
intimidating with 'his boot toes just 
brushing the floor. “The command 
officers of this ship are all dead, 
and I’m the only one who can land 
us on Toughluck ... so put me 
down.” 

“Gorilla guano!” the face said, 
and the other trainlike fist came 
out of the fog in a flash an then 

he ... 

H e stood and looked at the cold 
man behind” the icy desk, who 
said, after long consideration, 

“Whadya mean, it went wrong 
again?” 

“I - mean - it - went - wrong 
again! That’s what!” His fists were 
bunched, and he looked ready to 
shaititer the desktop with one mighty 



blow. “Just because, I’m from tihe 
plains you knockeirs i tihink you can 
door me out, well you — ” 

“You ever been here before?” 

“No. And what’s that got to do 
with — ” 

“You never been in the Dream- 
house, huh?” 

“No, I never been in the Dream- 
house huh!” 

The cold man leaned carefully 
on the edge of his desk, and his 
voice sounded like cracked ice. 

“Now you listen to me, boy, and 
you listen good! I think you’re tryin’ 
to push it, do you know what I 
mean? I think you’re tryin’ to make 
the dream do somethin’ it isn’t sup- 
posed to do. And 'that don’t work! 
The feedback couples up the whole 
inducer; it wakes you up, and it 
makes me mad!” 

The young man was shaking his 
head. “No, I — ” 

“Lock up! I been in this business 
too long, dustbuster. You’ire what 
we call a cheater, tryin’ itio get a 
iiittle extra juice out of the grape.” 
He chilled the room for a while in 
silence, then spoke again, low and 
deliberately. 

“You get one more chance, boy. 
Just one! Bust this and you’re door- 
ed out for good. Understand?” 

The young man nodded; the usher 
opened the door and stood aside, 
and a fast glance flickered between 
the usher and the cold man at the 
desk. 

Ill 

W arily, creeping ahead slowly in 
a low crouch, he topped the 



DREAMHOUSE

ridge and searched the rolling land 
beyond. His sharp eyes were narrow- 
ed -and his, face wore a look of grim 
determination. Nothing moved in 
that barren land of rock and sand, 
nothing grew. It was a cruel land, 
harsh and inhospitable, alien; 'and 
there was something about it that 
made him uncomfortable. The girl 
crept up beside him, close, and push- 
ed her long, dark hair back from 
her large, brown eyes. 

“Do you see anything, Adam?” 
she whispered. He shook his head, 
still watching the hostile land. 

“But that doesn’t mean they 
aren’t there,” he said, voice low 
and level. He glanced at the charge 
indicator of his laser rifle. “Less 
than twenty percent.” 

“What are they?” she asked, an 
edge of fear showing behind the 
words. He gave a wry grin. 

“What are they? Part jaguar, part 
octopus, part wolverine, part shark, 
part lizard, part bat — probably not 
friendly at all.” 

She shuddered and attempted to 
draw the tattered remains of her 
coverall closer about her, but there 
was far more girl than there was 
material. 

“I wonder if we’ll ever find the 
others,” she said, then faltered. “If 
. there are any . .” 

“Perhaps someday. It’s a big 
world. And there’s always the 
chance that . maybe they weren’t 
as lucky as we.” 

The scene flashed through his 
mind: their tiny lifecraft screaming 
into the atmosphere of 'this unknown 
planet of an uncharted sun, its 
velocity too great for the autore- 



tros; the rending, tumbling crash 
across the desert; the two of them 
thrown clear, marooned with nothing 
but a laser rifle and their clothes. 
And the rifle was running out of 
charge, and they were running out of 
cloithes. Especially she. 

“Less than twenty percent,” he 
murmered. 

“Huh?” 

“The rifle,” he explained. “You 
see, the electronic charge is — ” 
**T here's one!" she shouted. He 
snapped up the rifle. A flitting, 
flopping, slathering, hairy scaled, 
gray-and^white striped, flat blur was 
browling land bubbling and surging 
up the slope. 

“. with eyes of flame,” he 
breathed. “. whiffling through 
the tulgy wood — ” 

**Ferchrisake shoot *n shutup!" 

“. and burbled at it came.” 

T he burbling bolt was kicking up 
a roostertail of sand behind it 
for a quarter mile, and the wind 
shrieking through its spines was deaf- 
ening. Tsssssssss-PAT! And the rifle 
slashed through several large boul- 
ders, a distant butte, the beast and 
left in its wake four miles of six- 
foot trench, two beast halves and a 
small atomic reaction blaze. 

“Oh Lord,” she said. “Not again. 
Let’s make tracks.” And she made 
some rapid ones back down the 
ridge. He followed, observantly 
wiatching the callipygian cavortion 
where her coverall failed to cover 
all. She finally slowed. 

“Keep going,” he yelled. “Keep 
going.” But after several bad falls 
he was forced to stop.

IF 




“Whait’s’ tihe matter?” she said, 
willing ithe blood from a flowing cut 
over his left eye. “Can’t you stand 
up?” 

“Well I have these little dizzy 
spells sometimes,” he said, trying 
to get a good look lat her breasts. 
“Probably from the crash, you 
know.” 

“Dizzy spells at least!” she 
snorted. “The way you handle that 
rifle and keep me racing through 
the rocks, I figure we’re going to run 
out of rifle charge, my clothes and 
your self-control all about the same 
time. Are you all right now?” 

He tore his gaze away and let 
her help him to his feet. 

“I guess I’ve hurt my leg,” he 
gritted, putting an arm around her 
to keep from falling. “1 . .’ . can’t 
seem to put any weight on it.” 

“Buddy, you got a window open 
upsitairs!” She disentangled herself, 
losing a little more coverall in the 
process. 

“And we should be thinking about 
a safe place for camp tonight too,” 
he went on. “Looks like there’s a 
cave up there in the side of that 
rim. Let’s — ” 

“Camp!” She stared at him . “It 
isn’t even midday yet!” 

“Yeah well it’s always a good 
idea to stop early, you know. We 
don’t know very much about this 
planet, and you’re littler than me.” 

She blinked. “And what’s that got 
to do with anything?” 

“Well . .” He grinned. “I just 
thought I’d remind you in case I 
have to — ” 

She kicked him in tthe kneecap. 
He sat down. 



“Whadya do that for? Now I am 
hurt!” 

“You gonna get hurter too if you 
don’t mental up. Let’s go!” She 
swung away, but stopped. “You lead. 
I’ll keep an eye on the rear.” 

He started to laugh, but decided 
not to. Reluctantly, he limped by 
her, and they started again across 
the vast land. In a short time he was 
once more caught up in the grim 
search for danger. His keen mind 
'became more clear, his instincts — 

^^rwihere*s oner she screamed. He 
JL jumped and nearly ^ot his 
foot off. 

“Dammit, will you not do that!” 
*"There there there there!’* She 
was pointing at a far figure on a 
far hill. He let the rifle drop. 

“Goodgawd, that’s over three 
miles away.” 

“Too closer 

He squinted against the sun, 
frowned, then squinted harder. 
“Hey ... I think that’s a human.” 
She squinted. “It can’t be.” 

“I think it’s a girl!” 

**Shootr 

But he was gone at a gallop. 

It was a human, and it was a girl 
human. It was a lithe and little, 
peaches and cream, pert and pretty, 
natural redhead, blue eyed, nude 
and nubile girl human. She smiled 
up at him in an open, childlike 
manner as he came to a breathless 
standstill. 

“Hi there,” she said in a soft, 
little girl voice. “I’m Susie Lou. I’m 
twenty years old and never been out

smiling; bult diere were frost flecks 
in his eyeis, and everything seemed 
to be frosted in the txxMn. Even 
the air wias fuzzy. The cold man 
spoke, and the temperature came 
down twelve degrees. 

“She sure was askin’ for it, wasn’t 
slie?” 

He nodded. She sure was! The 
cold man was right that time. Yes- 
sir! She .... He suddenly stood 
stunned and staring. The cold man’s 
smile widened, lowering that tem- 
perature. 

“Yep, (that was quite a dream 
you had, boy.” 

He bit his lower lip. “But 
how — ” 

The cold man waved a frosty 
hand. 

“Nothing to it. A siimple matter 
of negative feedback into a recorder 
— some such ilas-h up as that — 
but that isn’t what we’re concerned 
about, is it?” 

He rubbed his forehead. “I re- 
member . you called me a liar.” 

“Just a formality, boy. We 
couldn’t have you waking up with 
the wrong ideas, now could we?” 

“What?” He turned toward the 
door. The usher was parked against 
it like a stalled truck. He swung 
back. “What’s goin’ on here?” 

The cold man spread his hands. 
“My dear boy! It’s not for me to 
say.” 

He stared at the cold man, and 
from deep inside he could feel heat 
rising. 

“Well, somebody sure as hell bet- 
ter say ’cause I don’t know what 
you’re talkin’ about!” 



The frozen smile vanished. “We’re 
talkin’ about your dream makin’ 
some mighty entertaining moments 
for the old folks at home, that’s what 
we’re talkin’ about! You tuned in 
now?” 

His voice was a long time coming 
even though his mouth was open and 
waiting for it.

“Beautiful! We’U just turn it over

with some papers.

“I’ll tell you what I don’t want,

“EK)n’t act stupid just because 
it’s easy. You came after a Vicky 
and don’t tell me you didn’t.” 

. Well I don’t even know what 
a ‘Vicky’ is!” 

It was the cold man’s turn to 
blink. He looked at the young man, 
then at the usher, then back. 

“Assuming you’ve got a real 
corner on dumb. I’ll tell you what a 
Vicky is: it’s a vicarious experience 
concerning a girl. And it’s — well, 
I’U be damned. I haven’t seen any- 
body blush like that for 'thirty years. 
Okay, so you’re ignorant. Now, since 
we’re nice guys and you’re a custo- 
mer, we’re gonna make a little ar-

“Five — ” 

“Let’s say you’re buyin’ your re- 
cording so we won’t lose it in the 
wrong place.” 

“But I haven’t got that — ” 

“’Course not. You’re gonna get 
it.” 

He got it. 

He called an old uncle and told 
an old story, and the five big ones 
came sizzling in, hot in his hand. 
So he laid them quickly on the icy 
desk, and the cold man smiled 
through the steam and said: “We’re 
not really baddies, boy, we’re gonna 
fix you up real right.” 

T he ship gave a final shudder as 
it warpled into hyperdrive, and 
the dull hum of utility circuits was 
the only sound on the control deck. 



Then came two whooshes of released 
breaths. He rolled his head and 
grinned at the other man. 

“Well, Stud, we’re on our wayl” 

The other returned the grin and 
began unbuckling from his accelera- 
tion couch. “You know it, BuU,” he 
laughed. “Just us and two hundred 
women. Man, that’s tough duty!” 

“Yeah!” He fumbled with his own 
straps. “And nineteen years of it, 
even in hot hyperdrive, before planet- 
fall. I just don’t know how we’re 
gonna stand it.” 

They both giggled. The other 
stood up and stretched. “Guess we’ll 
have our little colony pretty well 
started by then.” 

“At least .... Say, help me with 
these damn straps, will you?” 

“You know? I’ve never been so 
outnumbered and felt so good 
about k in my whole life.” 

“You know it. Want to help me 
here?” 

“When I get back. Bull. I thought 
I’d just drop down and see how 
the girls are for a second. See if 
they’re all right.” He laughed, a little 
too fast and a little too high. “We 
can’t afford any damaged cargo, 
can we?” 

“WeU just get me out of here, will 
ya?” He struggled against the tight 
webbing. “I can’t reach the buckles 
or somethin’.” 

The other dropped through a 
hatch and disappeared. “I’ll be right 
back.” His laugh echoed behind him. 
“Maybe in a year or two or three 
or four . .”

“Aw dammit, Bull, that ain’t fair.”

It was but a moment’s work to

small meters. 

“Yessir,” he nodded. “There’s a

“How bad?” 

“Surging eighteen to twenty over

“What’s the dream?” 

The usher paused, referring to a 
file panel. “Group hunting; big

long printout sheet. “Three people; 
man and wife . and friend.” 
“Oh Lord,” the cold man breath- 
ed. He rested his head in his hands. 
“Better get a monitor on it.” 

“Right.” The usher flicked a 
switch under meter 204. “Shall I 
close the wall?” 

“Yeah, we may have to bring one

The usher touched another

switch, and a false wall lowered, 
hiding the meters. “Are they coming

The cold man nodded. “Have him

bring back our damn carts! They’ve 
got about four now. And make out

ably can’t afford it, but we can check

“Yessir. Anything else?”

“Right. I’ll check out 204 now. 
Get ready for a hot one.” 

The usher/ sergeant left. The cold 
man rubbed a hand across his face, 
blew out a long breath, then leaned 
back in his chair and became very 
cold indeed. 

“There is going to be a crime of 
violence on New Kansas pretty soon 
now,” he said softly to the empty

The Jaws 
Of Danger 

by PIERS ANTHONY 

Illustrated by BODE 

P/fy the poor dentist whose 
patient is big as a whale — 
with a toothache to match! 



I patch. He handed it to Dillingham 

and stood by anxiously. 

T he Enen — for Dr. Dillingham The dentist popped it into the hop- 
preferred. the acronym to per of the transcoder. “Emergency,” 

“North Nebula humanoid species” the little speaker said. “Only you 

— rushed in and chewed out a mes- can handle this, Doctor!” 
sage^stiok with machine-like dis- “You’ll have to be more specific. 



106 




Holmes,” he said and watched the 
transcoder type this ont® another 
stick. Since the Enens had no spok- 
en language and he had not learned 
to decipher their tooth-dents, the 
transcoder was the vital link in com- 
munication. 

The names he applied to the En- 
ens were facetious. These galactics 
had no names in their own language, 
and they comprehended his humor in 
this regard no more than had his pa- 
tients back on distant Earth. But at 
least they were industrious folk and 
very clever at physical science. 

T he Enen read the stick and put 
it 'between his teeth for a hur- 
ried footnote. It was amazing, Dil- 
lingham thought, how effectively 
they could flex their jaws for min- 
ute variations in depth and slant. 
Compared to this, the human jaw 
was a clumsy portcullis. 

The message went hack to the 
machine. “It"s a big toothache that 
no one can cure. You must come.” 
“Oh, come now, Watson,” Dilling- 
ham said, deeply flattered. “I’ve been 
training your dentists for six months 
now, and I must admit they’re ex- 
perienced and intelligent specialists. 
They know their maxillaries from 
their mandibulars. As a matter of 
fact, some of them are a good deal 
more adept than I, except in the 
specific area of metallic restorations. 
Surely — ” 

But the Enen grabbed the stick 
before any more could be imprinted 
by the machine’s clattering jaws. 
“Doctor — this is an alien. It’s the 
son of the high muckamuck of 
deep.” The terms, of course, were 



the ones he had programmed to in- 
dicate any ruling idignitary of any 
Other planet. He wondered whether 
he would he well advised to substi- 
tute more serious designations before 
someone caught on. Tomorrow, per- 
haps, he would see about it. “You, 
Doctor, are our only practicing ex- 
odontist. ” 




Ah — now it was coming clear. He 
was a stranger from a far planet — 
and a dentist. Ergo, he must know 
all about off-world dentition. The 
Enen’s faith was touching. Well, if 
this was a job they could not han- 
dle, he could at least take a look at 
it. The “alien” could hardly have 
stranger dentition than the Enens 
themselves, and success might re- 
present a handsome credit toward 
his eventual freedom. It would cer- 



IN THE JAWS OF DANGER

tainly be more challenging than drill- 
ing his afternoon class in Applica- 
tions of Supercolloid. 

“rm pretty busy with that new 
group of trainees,” he said. This was 
merely a dodge to elicit more infor- 
mation, since the Enens tended to 
omit important details. They did not 
do so intentionally; it was just that 
their notions of importance differed 
here and there from his own. 

“The muckamuck has offered fifty 
pounds of frumpstiggle for this one 
service,” the Enen replied. 

D illingham whistled, and the trans- 
coder dutifully printed the 
translation. Frumpstiggle was neither 
money nor merchandise. He had 
never been able to pin down exactly 
what it was, but for convenience 
thought of it as worth it’s exact 
weight in gold: $35 per ounce, $560 
per pound. ^The Enens did not em- 
ploy money as such, but their avid 
barter for frumpstiggle seemed 
roughly equivalent. His commission 
on fifty pounds would amount to a 
handsome dividend and would bring 
his return to Earth that much closer. 

“All right,” he said. “Bring the 
patient in.” 

The Enen became agitated. “The 
high muckamuck's family can’t leave 
the planet. You must go to Gleep.” 
He had half expected something 
of this sort. The Enens galavanted 
from planet to planet and system to 
system with dismaying nonchalance. 
Dillingham had not yet become ac- 
customed to the several ways in 
which they far excelled Earth tech- 
nology, nor the abrupt manner of 
their transactions. One of their cap- 



tains (strictly speaking, they didn’t 
have officers, but this was a minor 
matter) had required dental help 
and simply stopped off at the near- 
est inhabited planet, skipping the 
normal formalities, and visited a lo- 
cal practitioner. Realizing that local 
technique was in some respects su- 
perior to that of the home planet, 
the captain had brought the practi- 
tioner along. 

Thus Dillingham had found him- 
self the property of the Enens — 
he who had never dreamed of any- 
thing other than conventional retire- 
ment in Florida. He was no intrepid 
spaceman, no seeker of fortune. He 
had been treated well enough, and 
certainly the Enens respected his abil- 
ities more than had his patients on 
Earth; but galactic intercourse was 
more unsettling than exciting for a 
man of his maturity.

IF 



“I’ll go and pack my bag,” he said. 
U 

G leep turned out to be a water 
world. The ship splashed down 
beside a floating way station, and 
they were transferred to a tanklike 
amphibian vehicle. It rolled into the 
ocean and paddled along somewhat 
below the surface. 

Dillingham had read somewhere 
that intelligent life could not evolve 
in water, because of the inhibiting 
effect of the liquid medium upon the 
motion of specialized appendages. 
Certainly the fish of Earth had never 
amounted to much. How could pri- 
mitive swimmers hope to engage in 
interstellar comimerce? 

Evidently that particular theory 
was wrong, elsewhere in the galaxy. 
Still, he wondered just how the 
Gleeps had circumvented the rapid- 
motion barrier. Did they live in 
domes under the ocean? 

He hoped the patient would not 
prove to be too alien. Presumably 
it had teeth; but that might very well 
be the least of the problems. At any 
rate, he could draw on whatever 
knowledge the Enens had, and he 
had also made sure to bring a second 
transooder keyed to Gleep. It was 
awkward to carry two machines, but 
too much could be lost in retransla- 
tion if he had to get the Gleep com- 
plaints relayed through the Enens. 

A monstrous whale-shape loomed 
in the porthole. The thing spied the 
sub, advanced, and opened a caver- 
nous maw. “Look out!” he yelled, 
wishing the driver had ears. 

The Enen (glanced indifferently at 



the message-stick and chomped a 
casual reply. “Everything is in order, 
Doctor.” 

“But a Leviathan is about to en- 
gulf us!” 

“Naturally. That’s a Gleep.” 




Dillingham stared out the port, 
stunned. No wonder the citizens 
couldn’t leave the planet! It was a 
matter of physics, not convention. 

The vessel was already inside the 
colossal mouth, and the jaws were 
closing. “You mean — you mean this 
is the patient?” But he already had 
his answer. Damn those little details 
the Enens forgot to mention. A 
whale! 

The mouth was shut now, and the 
headlight of the sub speared out to 
reveal encompassing mountains of 
flexing flesh. The treads touched land

— probably the tongue — and took 
hold. A minute’s climb brought them 
into a great domed air chamlber. 

They came to a halt beside what 
reminded him of the white cliffs of 
Dover. The hatch sprang open, and 
the Enens piled out. None of them 
seemed concerned about the possi- 
bility that the creature might invol- 
untarily swallow, so Dillingham put 
that thought as far from his mind as 
he was able. His skull seemed deter- 
mined to hold it in, unfortunately. 

CC'T^his is the tooth,” the Enen’s 
A message said. The driver 
pointed to a solid marble boulder. 

Dillingham contemplated it. The 
tooth stood about twelve feet high, 
counting only the distance it pro- 
jected from the spongy gingival tis- 
sue. Much more would be below, of 
course. 

“I see,” he said. He could think 
of nothing more pertinent at the mo- 
ment. He looked at the bag in his 
hand, which contained an assortment 
of needle^pointed probes, several 
ounces of instant amalgam and sun- 
dry additional staples. In the sub was 
a portable drill with a heavy-duty 
needle attachment that could easily 
excavate a cavity a full inch deep. 

Well, they had called it a ‘"big 
toothache.” He just hadn’t been 
alert. 

They brought forth a light ex- 
tendible ladder and leaned it against 
the tooth. They set his drill and 
transcoders beside it. “Summon us 
when you’re finished,” their parting 
message said. 

Dillingham felt automatically for 
the electronic signal in his pocket. 



By the time he drew breath to pro- 
test, the amphibian was gone. 

He was alone in the mouth of a 
monster. 

Well, he’d been in awkward situa- 
tions before. He tried once again to 
close his mind to the horrors that 
lurked about him and ascended the 
ladder, holding his lantern aloft. 

The occlusal surface was about ten 
feet in diameter. It was slightly con- 
cave and worn smooth. In the center 
was a dark trench about two feet 
wide and over a yard long. This was 
obviously the source of the irritation. 

He walked over to it and looked 
down. A putrid stench sent him 
gasping back. Yes — this was the 
cavity. It seemed to range from a 
foot in depth at the edges to four 
feet in the center. 

“That,” he said aloud, “is a case 
of dental caries for the record book.” 




110 



IF 



U nfortunately, he had no record 
book. All he possessed was a 
useless bag of implements and a 
smarting nose. But there was nothing 
for it, hut to explore the magnitude 
of the decay. It probably extended 
laterally within the pulp, so that the 
total infected area was considerably 
larger than that visible from above. 
He would have to check this direct- 

•y- 

He forced himself to breathe regu- 
larly, though his stomach danced in 
protest. He stepped down into the 
cavity. 

The muck was ankle-deep and the 
miasma overpowering. He summoned 
the dregs of his willpower and squat- 
ted to poke into the 'bottom with one 
finger. Under the slime, the surface 
was like packed earth. He was prob- 
ably still inches from the material 
of the tooth itself; these were merely 
layers of crushed and spoiling food. 

He remembered long-^ago jokes 
about eating apple-compote, pro- 
nouncing the word with an internal 
“S”. Compost. It was not a joke any 
more. 

He located a dry area and scuffed 
it with one foot. Some dark flakes 
turned up, but no real impression 
had been made. He wound up and 
drove his toe into the wall as hard 
as he could. 

There was a thunderous roar. He 
clapped his hands to his ears as the 
air pressure increased explosively. 
His footing slipped, and he fell into 
the reeking center-section of the 
trench. 

An avalanche of muck descended 
upon him. Overhead, himdreds of 
tons of flesh and bone and gristle 



crashed down imperiously, seeming 
ready to crush every particle of mat- 
ter within its compass into further 
compost. 

The jaws were closing. 

D illingham found himself face 
down in sickening garbage, his 
ears ringing from the atmospheric 
compression and his body quivering 
from the mechanical one. The lan- 
tern, miraculously, was undamaged 
and bright, and his own limbs were 
sound. He sat up, brushed some of 
the sludge from face and arms and 
grabbed for the slippery light. 

He was trapped between clench- 
ed jaws — inside the cavity. 

Frantically he activated the signal. 
After an interminable period while 
he waited in mortal fear of suffoca- 
tion, the ponderous upper jaw lifted. 
He scrambled out, dripping. 

The bag of implements was now 
a thin layer of color on the surface 
of the tooth. “Perfect occlusal,” he 
murmured professionally, while shak- 
ing in violent reaction to the realiza- 
tion that his fall had narrowly saved 
him from the same fate. 

The ladder was gone. Anxious to 
remove himself from the dangerous 
biting surface as quickly as possible, 
he prepared to jump but saw a gigan- 
tic mass of tentacles reaching for his 
portable drill near the base of the 
tooth. Each tentacle appeared to be 
thirty feet or more in length and as 
strong as a python’s tail. 

The biting surface no longer seem- 
ed so dangerous. Dillingham remain- 
ed where he was and watched the 
drill being carried into the darkness 
of the mouth’s center. 



iN THE JAWS OF DANGER 



m 





In a few more minutes the amphi- 
bian vehicle appeared. The Enen 
driver emerged, chewed a stick, pre- 
sented it. Dillingham reached for the 
transcoder and discovered that it 
was the wrong one. All he had now 
was the useless Gleep interpreter. 

Chagrined, he fiddled with it. At 
least he could set k to play back 
whatever the Gleep prince might 
have said. Perhaps there had been 
meaning in that roar .... 

There had been. “OUCH!” the 
machine exclaimed. 

Ill 

T he next few hours were compli- 
cated. Dillingham now had to 
speak to the Enens via the Gleep 
muokamuck (after the episode in the 



cavity, he regretted this nomencla- 
ture acutely), who had been sum- 
moned for a diagnostic conference. 
This was accomplished by setting up 
shop in the creature’s communica- 
tions department. 

The compartment was actually an 
offshoot (from the Gleep lung, deep 
inside the body. It was a huge inter- 
nal air space with sensitive tentacles 
bunching from the walls. This was 
the manner in Which the dominant 
species of this landless planet had 
developed fast-moving appendages 
whose manipulation led eventually to 
tools and intelligence. An entire tech- 
nology had developed — inside the 
great bodies. 

“So you see,” he said, “I have 
to have an anesthetic that will do the 
job and canned air the breathe while 
I’m working and a power drill that 
will handle up to an eighteen-indh 
depth of rock. Also a sledgehammer 
and a dozen wedges. And a derrick 
and the following quantities of — ” 
He went on to make a startling list 
of supplies. 

The transcoder sprouted half a 
dozen tentacles and waved them in 
a dizzying semaphore. After a mo- 
ment a group of the wall-tentacles 
waved back. “It shall be accomplish- 
ed,” the muckamuck reply came. 

Dillingham wondered what visual 
signal had projected the “ouchl” 
back in the patients mouth. Then it 
came to him: the tentacles that had 
absconded with his drill and other 
transcoder were extensions of the 
creature’s tongue! Naturally they 
talked. 

“One Other thing: while you’re 
procuring my equipment, I’d like to 



112 



IF 



see a diagram of the internal struc- 
ture of your molars.” 

“Structure?” The tentacles were 
agitated. 

“The pattern of enamel, dentin 
and pulp, or whatever passes for it in 
your system. A schematic drawing 
would do nicely. Or a sagittal section 
showing both the nerves and the 
bony socket. That tooth is still quite 
sensitive, which means the nerve is 
still alive. I wouldn’t want to damage 
it unnecessarily.” 

“We have no diagrams.” 
Dillingham was shocked. “Don’t 
you know the anatomy of your teeth? 
How have you repaired them be- 
fore?” 

“We have never had trouble with 
them ibefore. We have no dentists. 
That is why we summoned you.” 

He paced the floor of the cham- 
ber, amazed. How was it possible for 
such intelligent and powerful crea- 
tures to remain so ignorant of mat- 
ters vital to their well-being? Never 
had trouble before? That cavity had 
obviously been festering for many 
years. 

Yet he had faced similar ignorance 
daily during his Earth practice. “I’ll 
be working blind, in that case,” he 
said at last. You must understand 
that while I’ll naturally do my best, 
I can not guarantee to save the 
tooth.” 

“We understand,” the deep muck- 
amuck replied contritely. 

B ack on the tooth (after a stern 
warning to Junior to keep those 
jaws apart no matter how uncomfor- 
table things got), equipped with a 
face mask, respirator, elbow-length 



gloves and hip boots, Dillingham' 
began the hardest labor of his life. 
It was not intellectually demanding 
or particularly intricate — just hard. 
He was vaporizing the festering walls 
of the cavity with a thirty-pound 
laser drill, and in half an hour his 
arms were dead tired. 

There was lateral extension of the 
infection. He had to wedge himself 
into a rotting, diminishing cavern, 
wielding the beam at arm’s length 
before him. He had to twist the gen- 
erator sidewise to penetrate every 
branching side pocket, all the while 
frankly terrified lest the beam slip 
and accidently touch part of his own 
body. He was playing with fire — a 
fiery beam that could slice off his 
arm and puff it into vapor in less 
than a careless second. 




IN THE JAWS OF DANGER 



113 




At least he thought sweatily, he 
wasn’t going to have to use the 
sledgehammer here. When he order- 
ed the drill, he had expected a mech- 
anical one similar to those pistons 
used to break up pavement on Earth. 
To the deep, however, a drill was 
a laser beam. This was indeed far 
superior to what he had had in mind. 
Deadly, yes — but real serendipity. 

Backbreaking hours later it was 
done. Sterile walls of dentin lined the 
cavity on every side. Yet this was 
only the beginning. 

Dillingham, after a short nap right 
there in the now-aseptic cavity, rous- 
ed himself to make careful measure- 
ments. He had to be certain that 
every alley was widest at the open- 
ing, and that none were too sharply 
twisted. Wherever the measurements 
were unsatisfactory, he drilled away 
healthy material until the desired 
configuration had been achieved. He 
also adjusted the beam for “polish” 
and wiped away the rough surfaces. 

H e signaled the Enen sub and in- 
dicated by gestures that it was 
time for the tank of supercolloid. 
And resolved that next time he went 
anywhere, he wpuld bring a trunkful 
of spare transcoders. He had prob- 
lems enough without translation dif- 
ficulties. At least he had been able to 
make clear that they had to send a 
scout back to the home planet to 
pick up the bulk supplies. 

Supercolloid was a substance de- 
veloped by the ingenious Enens in 
response to his exorbitant specifica- 
tions of several months before. He 
had once entertained the notion that 
if he were slightly unreasonable, they 



would ship him home. Instead they 
had met the specifications exactly 
and increased his assessed value, 
neatly adding years to his term of 
captivity. He became more careful 
after that — but the substance re- 
mained a prosthodontist’s dream. 

Supercolloid was a fluid, stored 
under pressure, that set rapidly when 
released. It held its shape indefinitely 
without measurable distortion, yet 
was as flexible as rubber. It was ideal 
for difficult impressions, since it 
could give way while being with- 
drawn and spring immediately back 
to the proper shape. This saved time 
and reduced error. At 1300 degrees 
Fahrenheit it melted suddenly into 
the thin, transparent fluid from 
which it started. This was its most 
important property. 

Dillingham was about to make a 
very large cast. To begin the complex 
procedure, he had to fill every crev- 
ice of the cavity with colloid. Since 
the volume of the cleaned cavity 
came to about forty cubic feet, and 
supercolloid weighed fifty pounds per 
cubic foot when set, he required a 
good two thousand pounds of it, at 
the very least. 

A full ton — to fill a single cav- 
ity. “Think big,” he told himself. 

He set up the tank and hauled the 
long hose into the pit. Once more he 
crawled headfirst into the lateral ex- 
pansion, no longer needing the face 
mask. He aimed the nozzle without 
fear and squirted the foamy green 
liquid into the farthest offshoot, mak- 
ing certain that no air spaces re- 
mained. He backed off a few feet 
and filled the other crevices, but left 
the main section open.

IF 




In half an hour the lateral branch 
had been simplified considerably. It 
was now a deep, flat crack without 
.offshoots. Dillingham put away the 
nozzle and crawled in with selected 
knives and brushes. He cut away pro- 
jecting colloid, leaving each filling 
flush with the main crevice wall, and 
painted purple fixative over each 
surface. 

S atisfied at last, he trotted out the 
colloid hose again and started 
the pump. This time he opened the 
nozzle to full aperture and filled the 
main crevice, backing away as the 
foam threatened to engulf him. Soon 
all of the space was full. He smooth- 
ed the green wall facing the main 
cavity and painted it in the same 
manner as the offshoots. 

Now he was ready for the big one. 
So far he had used up about eight 
cubic feet of colloid, but the gaping 
center pit would require over thirty 
feet. He removed the nozzle entirely 
and let the tank heave itself out. The 
cavity was rapidly being filled. 

“Turn it off,” he yelled to the 
Enen by the pump as green foam 
bulged gently over the rim. One ton 
of supercolloid filled the tooth, and 
he was ready to carve it down and 
insert the special plastic loop in the 
center. 

The foam continued to pump. “I 
said TURN IT OFF!” he cried again. 
Then he remembered that he had 
no transcoder for Enen. They could 
neither hear him nor comprehend 
him. 

He flipped the hose away from the 
filling and aimed it over the edge of 
the tooth. He had no way to cut it 



off himself, since he had removed the 
nozzle. There couldn’t be much left 
in the tank. 

A rivulet of green coursed over the 
pink tissues, traveling toward the 
squidlike tongue. The tentacles reach- 
ed out, grasping the foam as it solid- 
ified. They soon became festooned 
in green. 

Dillingham laughed — but not for 
long. There was a steamwhistle sigh 
followed by a violent tremor of the 
entire jaw. “I’m going to . sneeze,” 
the deep transcoder said, sounding 
fuzzy. 

The colloid was interfering with 
the articulation of the Gleep’s tongue. 

A sneeze! Suddenly he realized 
what that would mean to him and 
the Enen crew. 

“Get under cover!” he shouted to 
the Enens, again forgetting that they 
couldn’t perceive the warning. But 
they had already grasped the signifi- 
cance of the tremors and were piling 
into the sub frantically. 

“Hey — wait for me!” But he was 
too late. The air howled by with the 
titanic intake of breath. There was a 
terrible pause. 

Dillingham lunged for the mound 
of colloid and dug his fingers into 
the almost-solid substance. “Keep 
your jaws apart!” he yelled at the 
Gleep, praying it could still pick up 
the message. “KEEP THEM OP- 
EN!” 

The sound of a tornado raged out 
of its throat. He buried his face in 
green as the hurricane struck, 
wrenching mercilessly at bis body. 
His arms were wrenched cruelly; his 
fingers tore through the infirm col- 
loid, slipping ....

T he wind died, leaving him gasp- 
ing at the edge of the tooth. He 
had survived it. The jaws had not 
closed. 

He looked up. The upper cuspids 
hung only ten feet above, visible in 
the light from the charmed lamp 
hooked somehow to his foot. 

He was past the point of reaction. 
“Open, please,” he called in his best 
operative manner, hoping the trans- 
coder was still in the vicinity, and 
went to peer over the edge. 

There was no sign of /he sub. The 
tank, with its discharging hose, was 
also gone. 

H^ took a walk across the neigh- 
boring teeth, looking for whatever 
there was to see. He was appalled at 



the amount of decalcification and 
outright decay in evidence. This 
deep child would shortly be in pain 
again, unless substantial restorative 
work was done immediately. 

But in a shallow cavity — one 
barely a foot deep — he found the 
transcoder. “It’s an ill decalcifica- 
tion that bodes nobody good,” he 
murmured, retrieving it. 

The sub reappeared and disgorged 
its somewhat shaken passengers. Dil- 
lingham marched back over the rut- 
ted highway and joined them. But 
the question still nagged his mind: 
how could the caries he had observ- 
ed be reconciled with the mucka- 
muck’s undoubtedly -sincere state- 
ment that there had never been den- 
tal trouble before? What had chang- 
ed? 

He carved the green surface into 
an appropriate pattern and carefully 
applied his fixitive. He was ready for 
the next step. 

Now the derrick was brought up 
and put in play. Dillingham guided 
its dangling hook into the eyelet set 
in the colloid and signalled the Enen 
operator to lift. The chain went taut; 
the mass of solidified foam eased 
grandly out of its socket and hung 
in the air, an oddly-shaped boulder. 

He turned his attention to the big 
crevice-filling. He screwed in a cork- 
screw eyelet and arranged a pulley so 
that the derrick could act on it effec- 
tively. The purple fixative had pre- 
vented the surface of the main im- 
pression from attaching to that of 
the subsidiary one — just as it was 
also protecting the several smaller 
branches within. 

There was no real trouble. In due 



116 



IF 



course every segment of the impres- 
sion was marked and laid out in the 
makeshift laboratory he had set up 
near the waterlift of the Gleep’s 
mouth. They were ready for one 
more step. 

T he tank of prepared investment 
arrived. This, too was a special 
composition. It remained fluid until 
triggered by a particular electric jolt, 
whereupon it solidified instantly. 
Once solid, it could not be affected 
by anything short of demolition by 
a sledgehammer. 

Dillingham pumped a quantity in- 
to a great temporary vat. He at- 
tached a plastic handle to the small- 
est impression, dipped it into the vat, 
withdrew it entirely covered by white 
batter and touched the electrode to it. 
He handed the abruptly solid object 
to the nearest Enen. 

Restorative procedure on deep 
differed somewhat from established 
Earth technique. All it took was a 
little human imagination and Enen 
technology. 

The octopus-tongue approached 
while he worked. It reached for him. 
“Get out of here or I’ll cram you 
into the burnout furnace!” he snap- 
ped into the transcoder. The tongue 
retreated. 

The major section was a problem. 
It barely fit into the vat, and a solid 
foot of it projected over the top. 
He finally had the derrick lower it 
until it bumped bottom, then raise 
it a few inches and hold it steady. 
He passed out brushes, and he and 
the Enen crew went to work slop- 
ping the goo over the top and around 
the suspending hook. 



He touched the electrode to tihe 
white monster. The derrick lifted 
the mass, letting the empty vat fall 
free. Yet another stage was done. 

Two ovens were employed for the 
burnout. Each was big enough for 
a man to stand within. They placed 
the ends of the plastic rods into 
special holders and managed to fit 
all of the smaller units into one oven, 
fastening them into place by means 
of a heat-resistant framework. The 
main chunk sat in the other oven, 
propped upside-down. 

They sealed the ovens and set their 
thermostats for 2,000 degrees. Dill- 
ingham lay down in the empty vat 
and slept. 

T hree hours later burnout was 
over. Even supercolloid took 
time to melt completely when heated 
in a 1500 pound mass. But now the 
green liquid had been drained into 
reservoirs and sealed away, while the 
smaller quantities of melted plastic 
were allowed to collect in a disposal 
vat. The white investments were hol- 
low shells, open only where the plas- 
tic rods had project^. 

The casting was the most spectac- 
ular stage. Dillingham had decided 
to use gold, though worried that its 
high specific gravity would overbal- 
ance the Gleep jaw. It was impossible 
under present conditions to arrange 
for a gold-^pIated, matching-density 
filling, and he was not familiar 
enough with other metals to be sure 
they were adaptable to his purpose. 
The expansion coefficient of his in- 
vestment matched that of gold ex- 
actly, for example; anything else 
would solidify into the wrong size. 



IN THE JAWS OF DANGER 



117 




Gold, at any rate, was nothing to 
the muckaimuck; his people re- 
fined it through their gills, extract- 
ing it from the surrounding water 
on order in any quantity. 

The crucible arrived: a self-pro- 
pelled boilerlike affair. They piled 
hundred-pound ingots of precise 
gold alloy into the hopper, while the 
volcanic innards of the crucible 
rumbled and belched and melted 
everything to rich bright liquid. 

A line of Enens carried the smaller 
investments, which were shaped in- 
side exactly like the original impres- 
sions, to the spigot and held them 
with tongs while the fluid fortune 
poured in. These were carefully de- 
posited in the vat, now filled with 
cold water. 



The last cast, of course, was the 
colossal vat-shaped one. This was 




simply propped up under the spigot 
while the tired crew kept feeding in 
ingots. 

'By the time this cast had been 
poured, twenty-four tons of gold had 
been used in all. 

While the largest chunk was being 
hauled to the opean inside the front 
of the mouth, Dillingham broke open 
the smaller investments and laid out 
the casts according to his chart of 
the cavity. He gave each a minimum 
of finishing; on so gross a scale, it 
could hardly make much difference. 

The finished casts weighed more 
than twenty times as much as the 
original colloid impressions had, and 
even the smallest ones were distinctly 
awkward to maneuver into place. He 
marked them, checked off their po- 
sitions on his chart and had the 
Enens ferry them up with the der- 
rick. At the other end, he manhan- 
dled each into its proper place, veri- 
fied its fit and position and withdrew 
it to paint it with cement. No part of 
this filling would come loose in ac- 
tion. 

O nce again the branching cavern 
lost its projections, this time per- 
manently, as each segment was se- 
cured and severed from its project- 
ing sprue. He kept the sprues — the 
handles of gold, the shape of the 
original plastic handles — on until 
the end, because otherwise there 
would have been no purchase on the 
weighty casts. He had to have some 
handle to adjust them. 

The derrick lowered the orevice- 
piece into the cavity. Two Enens 
pried it in with power crowbars. 
Dillingham stood by and squirted 



118 



IF 



cement over the mass as it slid re- 
luctantly into the hole. 

It was necessary to attach a heavy 
weight to the derrick-hook and swing 
it repeatedly against the four-ton 
cast in order to tamp it in all the 
way. 

At last it was time for the major 
assembly. Nineteen tons of gold de- 
scended slowly into the hole while 
they dumped quarts of liquid cement 
into a pool below. The cast touched 
bottom and settled into place, while 
the cement bubbled up around the 
edges and overflowed. 

They danced a little jig on top of 
the filling — just to tamp it in prop- 
erly, Dillingham told himself, wish- 
ing that a fraction of its value in 
Earth terms could be credited to his 
purchase-price. The job was over. 

V 

a A commendable performance,” 
the high muckamuck said. 
“My son is frisking about in his pen 
like a regular tadpole and eating 
well.” 

Dillingham remembered what he 
had seen during the walk along the 
occlusal surfaces. “I’m afraid he 
won’t be frisking long. In another 
year or two he’ll be feeling half a 
dozen other caries. Decay is ram- 
pant.” 

“You mean this will happen 
again?” The tentacles waved so vio- 
lently that the transcoder stuttered. 

Dillingham decided to take the fish 
by the tail. “Are you still trying to 
tell me that no member of your spe- 
cies has suffered dental caries be- 
fore this time?” 



“Never.” 

This still did not make sense. 
“Does your son’s diet differ in any 
important respect from yours, or 
from that of other children?” 

“My son is a prince!” 

“Meaning he can eat whatever he 
wants, whether it is good for him or 
not?” 

The Gleep paused. “He gets so 
upset if he doesn’t have his way. He’s 
only a baby — hardly three centuries 
old.” 

Dillingham was getting used to 
differing standards. “Do you feed 
him delicacies — refined foods?” 
“Naturally. Nothing but the best.” 
He sighed. “Muckamuck, my 
people also had perfect teeth — until 
they began consuming sweets and 
overly refined foods. Then dental 
caries became the most common 
disease among them. You’re going to 
have to curb your boy’s appetite.” 

“I couldn’t.” He could almost read 
the agitation of the tentacles without 
benefit of translation. “He’d throw 
a terrible tantrum.” 

He had expected this reaction. 
He’d encountered it many times on 
Earth. “In that case, you’d better 
begin training a crew of dentists. 
Your son will require constant at- 
tention.” 

“But we can’t do such work our- 
selves. We have no suitable append- 
ages, externally.” 

“Import some dentists, then. You 
have no alternative.” 

The creature signaled a sigh. “You 
make a convincing case.” The tenta- 
cles relaxed while it thought. Sud- 
denly they came alive again. “Enen

OCEAN ON TOP 



by HAL CLEMENT 



Illustrated by CASTELLON 



These people couldn't be breathing 
water a mile under the sea — but 
the facts were clear. They were! 



What has gone before - 

T ^hree of my friends had disap- 
peared in a single small area of 
the Pacific, just north of Easter 
Island. Like me, all worked for the 
Power Board, the group which was 
responsible for rationing man's 
severely limited supply of energy and 
which was, because of that fact, 
practically the world government. 



Bert Wehlstrahl had vanished a 
year before, and Joey Elfven ten 
months later. Marie Wladetzky had 
gone two weeks after Joe, presum- 
ably in search of him, and 1 was 
principally interested in finding 
Marie. (Don't ask for my name; ifs 
bad enough to have to listen to it 
occasionally, and Pm certainly not 
going to put it in print.) Since the 
two men were police workers of a 




121 




sort, it was likely that their disap- 
pearance was not accidental, so my 
first step was to search the ocean 
bottom in the key area from a cam- 
ouflaged vantage point — actually 
one of the spherical escape tanks 
used in ordinary cargo submarines, 
somewhat modified for my purpose, 

I found evidence of rationing vio- 
lation the moment I reached the bot- 
tom — / almost landed on it, A 
mile down there was an area actually 
lighted artificially and apparently 
concealed under a flat, translucent 
surface which I interpreted as some 
sort of fabric. Seeing energy wasted 
to light the outside of a tent roof 
was bad enough; the sight of a swim- 
mer in what looked like ordinary 
scuba gear under five thousand feet 
of sea water was far worse. The 
technological capacity so demon- 
strated suggested something much 
more serious than an ordinary black- 
market energy gang. 

My tank was not very maneuver- 
able, but I managed to get myself 
*'captured” and towed to an entrance 
to the undersea base. Here I dropped 
to sonar transponder, which should 
guide Board enforcement forces to 
the spot, released my ballast and 
headed for the surface with the com- 
fortable certainty that the swimmers 
could not follow far because of the 
pressure gradient. 

This belief proved wrong. One of 
them hung onto my tank and by 
pounding on it was able to guide a 
sub to the scene. After doing my 
best to get the nearly helpless tank 
away, I was really captured and 
dragged back to the bottom. 

-The tank was brought to a lighted 



pit in the ocean floor. There were 
no door or air locks. The swimmers, 
who had loaded my tank with 
enough ballast to keep it down even 
if they lost hold again, towed me 
into a tunnel which led from the 
entrance pit, along it for a short dis- 
tance, and into a flooded room. Then 
they removed their helmets. 




I t must be ♦bvious from the things 
I’ve already said that I’m no 
psychologist, though I’ve read a little 
about the field. I’ve been told that 
it’s possible for a person to deny 
flatly and categorioally the evidence 
of own senses, if their reports 
disagree violently enough with what 
he thinks he knows. In fact I’ve met 
people who claim that the ability to 
do this is all that keeps most of us 
sane. Until that moment, I’d doubted 
both statements. Now I’m not so 
sure. 

I’d seen us come in from definite, 
obvious sea-bottom conditions to the 
place where we now were. I 'had not 
seen anything even remotely like a 
door, valve or lock either open be- 
fore us or close ibehind us, and I 
had certainly been looking for one. 
To the best of my knowledge and 
belief, therefore, my tank was now 
in a room full of sea water at a 
pressure corresponding roughly to a 
mile’s* depth. 

I had seen ithe people now in the 
chamber around me swimming in 
the sea outside — the same people, 
for the most part. I had seen them, 
continually or nearly so, as they 
brought me in. They, too, were still 



122 



IF 




in high-pressure water and had been 
all along. I was forgetting for the 
moment the clarity with which I had 
been able to see those same faces 
in the water outside, but even if I’d 
remembered I probably wouldn’t 
have seen the relevance just then. 

I had seen them remove the hel- 
mets, just now, still apparently in 
high-pressure water. No, I couldn’t 
believe all of that at once. I was 
missing something, but I couldn’t 
believe it was recently an observable 
fact. I’d been battered around during 
the storm and had certainly missed 
the technique which had been used 
in finding me, but I hadn’t been un- 
conscious, then or later. I was short 
on sleep, but surely not so dazed by 
it as to have missed any major hap- 
penings. I had to believe that my ob- 
servations were reasonably complete. 
Since I was, in spite of that belief, 
clearly out of phase with reality, 
there was something I just plain 
didn’t know. It was time for more 
education. 

I wasn’t too worried about my 
personal future; if there had been 
any intent to dispose of me, it could 
have been done earlier with much 
less trouble — and as I’ve said be- 
fore, I couldn’t believe, deep down, 
that people would do anything final 
to me anyway. If you think that 
doesn’t jibe with the way I’ve ad- 
mitted I felt a few minutes before, 
you ask a psychiatrist. 

I had a couple of days of breath- 
ing still in the tank, and presumably 
before that time was up my new 
acquaintances would do something 
about getting me out — though I 
couldn’t offhand see what it would 



be, now that I thought of the pirob- 
lem. Any way I looked at it, though, 
the next move seemed up to them. 
Maybe that shouldn’t have been 
comforting, but it was. 

Apparently they felt the same 
way — not comforted, I mean, but 
that they should be doing something. 
They were gathered in a group be- 
tween the tank and the door we had 
come through, apparently arguing 
some point. I couldn't hear their 
voices, and after a minute or two I 
decided they weren’t actually talk- 
ing; there was a tremendous amount 
of gesticulation. They must have a 
pretty comprehensive sign language, 
I decided. This was reasonable if 
they spent much of itiheir time, and 
especially if they did much of their 
work', under water. I couldn’t see 
why they used it now, since • my 
common sense was having trouble 
admitting that they were still in 
water. 

In any case, they seemed (to reach 
an agreement after a few minutes, 
and two of them went swimming — 
yes, swimming — off down one of 
the smaller shafts. 

I t occured to me that even if they 
couldn’t talk under the circum- 
stances, they should be able to hear. 

So I tried tapping on the walls 
of the tank to get their attention — 
gently, in view of my experience 
with tank-tapping so shortly before. 
Evidently they cou^d hear, though 
they had the expected' difficulty in 
judging the direclion of the sound 
source and it took them a few min- 
utes to recognize that I was re- 
sponsible. Then they swam over and 



OCEAN ON TOP 



123 




gathered around the tank, looking in 
through the ports. I turned on my 
inside lights again. None of them 
seemed surprised ait what they saw, 
though a continuous and animated 
gesture conversation was kept up. 

I tried yelling. It was hard on my 
own ears, since most of the sound 
echoed from the walls of the tank, 
but at least a little should get 
through. It evidently did; several of 
them shook their Jieads at me, pre- 
sumably indicating that .they couldn’t 
understand me. Since I hadn’t used 
any words yet, this wasn’t surprising. 
I tried telling them who I was — not 
using my name, of course — in 
each of the three languages in which 
I’m supposed to be proficient. I at- 
tempted to do the same in a couple 
of others in which I make no claim 
of skill. All I got was the head- 
shaking, and two or three people 
swam away, presumably dismissing 
me as a hopeless case. No one made 
any obvious attempt to communicate 
with me by any sort of sign or sound. 

Eventually I felt my throat getting 
sore, so I stopped. For another ten 
minutes or so nothing much happen- 
ed. Some more of the crowd swam 
away, but others arrived. There was 
more of the gesture talk; no doubt 
the newcomers were being given 
whatever there was to tell about me. 

AH the new arrivals wore cover- 
alls more or less like those I’d first 
seen outside, but some of these 
were in fancy colors. I got the im- 
pression that it was the difference 
between work clothes and white- 
collar suits, though I can’t give any 
objective reason for the notion. 

Then some new swimmers, less 



completely dressed, appeared from 
one of ithe tunnels, and things began 
to happen. One of them worked 
his way through what was by now 
quite a crowd, came up to the tank, 
and tapped it gently. It was refresh- 
ing to have one of them try to get my 
attention instead of the other way 
around, but the real jolt came when 
I recognized the newcomer. 

It was Bert Whelstrahl, who had 
disappeared a year before. 

IX 

H e recognized me, too; there was 
no doubt about that. He put 
on a larger-^thandif e-size grin the 
moment he got a good look through 
my port, gave another bit of knuckle 
play on the tank and then drew 
back and raised one eyebrow in 
an oh-no-what-do-we-do-with-.this- 
one expression. I decided the situ- 
ation justified using up what was left 
of my voice and called out, “Bert! 
Can you hear me?” 

He nodded, and made a palm- 
down gesture which I interpreted as 
meaning that I didn’t need to yell so 
loud. That was a relief. I cut volume 
and after a bit of trial and error 
found that he could hear me when I 
spoke only a little louder than a 
normal conversational tone. I began 
to ask questions, but he held up a 
hand to stop me and began making 
some more signs. He pinched his 
nose shut, holding the palm of his 
hand over his mouth at the same 
time; then he held this left wrist in 
front of his face as though he were 
looking at a watch, though he wasn’t 
wearing one. ; 



124 



IF 




I got his meaning dearly enough. 
He wanted to know how much 
breathing time I had left. I checked 
my panel, did a 'little mental arith- 
metic and called out that there was 
about fifty hours still in my tanks. 

Then he stuck a finger in his 
mouth and raised his eyebrows; I 
answered graphically, which was 
easier on my throat, by holding up 
the partly emptied box of dextrose 
pills. He nodded and put on a 
thoughtful expression. Then he hand- 
talked for two or three minutes to 
the people nearest him, the head 
motions which they threw in oc- 
casionally being the only part I 
could understand. With everyone 
seemingly agreed, he waved at me 
and vanished back into the tunnel 
he’d come from. 

Nothing more happened for the 
next half hour, except that the crowd 
grew even larger. Some of the new- 
comers were women, though I 
couldn’t tell whether the one I had 
seen outside was among them. I 
hadn’t seen her closely enough to 
recognize her face. Some of them 
certainly weren’t; apparently swim- 
ming doesn’t have to be the aid to 
figure control some people claim it 
to be. 

Then Bert came back. He was 
carrying what looked like an ordi- 
nary clip board, but when he held 
it up to the port I saw that the 
sheets on it weren’t paper. He 
scratched on the top one with a sty- 
lus, which left a mark. Then he lifted 
the top sheet, and the mark disap- 
peared. I’d seen toys of that sort 
years ago; apparently he’d spent 
some time improvising this one. It 



seemed a good and obvious solution 
to the problem of writing llujcr 
water, and I wondered why luoiie of 
the others had thought of it 

He had to print fairly large letters 
in order for me to read clearly, so 
even with the aid of the pad our 
communication was slow. I started 
by asking what the whole business 
was about, which didn’t help speed, 
either. Bert cut me off on one. 

“There isn’t time to give the 
whole story now,” he wrote. ‘*You 
have a decision to make ibefore you 
run out of air — at least twenty 
hours before, in fact. It has to do 
with whether you go back to the 
surface.” 

was surprised and made no secret 
of it. 

“You mean they’d let me go 
back? Why did they go to all that 
trouble to get me down here? I was 
already at the surface.” 

“Because your decision and its de- 
tails will affect a lot of people^ and 
you should know who and how. 
They didn’t know you were a Board 
official until I told them, but it was 
obvious your story when you got 
back would get to the Board any- 
way. It’s rather important just what 
the Board hears about this place.” 

“I suppose it’s a case of being re- 
leased if I promise to tell nothing. 
You know I couldn’t do that.” 

“Of course not. I couldn’t either. 
That’s not what they expect. They 
realize you couldn’t go back without 
telling; there would be no rational 
explanation of w’here you’d been or 
why. You can tel'l everything that’s 
happened to you and that you’ve

125 




seen, but there are other things they 
want to be sure you include. We 
must make sure you know them.” 
I jumped on the pronoun. 

“You switched from ‘(they’ to ‘we.’ 
Does that mean you’ve chosen to 
stay down here yourself?” 

“Yes.” This was a nod, not a 
written word. “For a while, any- 
way,” he added with the stylus. 

“Then you’ve managed to stomach 
the morals of a bunch of people 
who waste thousands of kilowatts 
just lighting up the sea bottom? 
Have you forgotten your upbringing, 
and why — ” 

He interrupted me with a violent 
shake of his head and began to 
write. 

“It’s not like that. I know it looks 
terrible, but it’s no more wasting 
power (than the Board is wasting the 
sunlight that falls on the Sahara. 
Maybe there’ll be time to explain 
more before you decide, but you’re 
enough of a physicist to see that 
analogy or you wouldn’t be a Board 
worker in the first place.” 

I spent some (time digesting that 
one. The Sahara point was under- 
standable. The Board has always re- 
sented having to let all that solar 
energy go unused. Their stock diffi- 
culty, of course, is deciding when it’s 
worth while to put energy into a 
project in the hope of getting more 
back'. It’s been the standard belief 
for decades that man’s only real hope 
lies in hydrogen fusion, and most 
of the authorized speculative expen- 
diture is for research in this direc- 
tion. From time to time, though, a 
very eloquent plea for a solar-energy 
project comes in. Sometimes an es- 



pecially promising one gets ap- 
proved, and one or two of these have 
even paid off since I’ve been work- 
ing for the outfit. 

I couldn’t see, though, how 
natural sunlight shining on a desert 
could compare with artificial light 
shining on the Sea bottom. I said so. 
He shrugged, and began to write. 

4 4'^T^he energy here comes from 
A below the crust — straight 
heat, though I can’t properly call it 
volcanic heat. If they don’t keep 
their working fluid circulating down 
to the collector and get the heat out 
of it when it comes back up, the 
hot end of the unit will melt. Your 
real complaint, if you must have one, 
is that they don’t tie into the plane- 
tary power net and observe the ra- 
tioning rules like everyone else. The 
reasons they don’t are very good, 
but there isn’t time to give them 
now — they call for a lot of history 
and technology which would take 
forever by this scribble-board. What 
I’m supposed to tell you is what you 
have to know if you go back up.” 

“I take it that Joey and Marie 
decided to stay down here.” 

“Joey hasn’t been here. Marie 
doesn’t believe me when I tell her 
that and is still arguing. No decision 
has been made in her case.” 

“But if Marie is still here withr her 
future unsettled, why did you say I 
have to make up my mind in thirty 
hours or so? She’s been down here 
for weeks. Obviously you have facili- 
ties to take care of us.” 

“We don’t ‘have’ them. They 
were made especially for her, as far 
as food and air are concerned. She’s

127 




still living in her sub. It would take 
more work to get supplies iinto your 
tank, whidh doesn’t have locks or 
air-charging valves. Besides, you’re 
not in quite as good a position as 
Marie to have people go out of their 
way for your convenience.” 

“Why not?” 

“You’re neither female nor good- 
looking.” I had no answer to that. 

“All right,” was al I could say. 
“Tell me the official word, then. 
What am I supposed to know if I 
go back?” 

“You’re to make sure your boss 
on the Board knows that we do have 
a large energy supply down here — ” 
‘That I’d tell him anyway.” 

“ — and that it isn’t being ra- 
tioned.” 

“That’s also pretty obvious. Why 
do you want those points stressed? 
I can’t think of any better way to 
get this place raided.” 

“Believe me, it wouldn’t be. If the 
Board thought this was just another 
hunch of powerleggers you’d be 
right, of course; but fifteen thousand 
people don’t make a gang. They 
make a nation, if you remember the 
word.” 

“Not pleasantly.” 

“Well, never mind that phase of 
history. The point is that the Board 
has hushed up this thing in the 
past and can be counted on to do 
it again if they know what they’re 
doing.” 

44 T Tush it up? You’re crazy. 

A A They’d do just one thing to 
an operating power plant, even if 
it was illegally built. They’d tie it into 
the network. The idea that they’d 



let it go on running independently, 
outside rationing, is dithering.” 
“Why do you suppose you never 
heard of this place before? It’s been 
here eighty years or more.” 

“I would suppK>se because no- 
body’s found it. That’s likely enough. 
The bottom of the Pacific isn’t the 
most thoroughly covered real estate 
on the planet.” 

“It’s been found many times. Sev- 
eral in the past year, if you’ll stop 
to remember. Twelve times that I’ve 
heard of since this place was built 
it has been reported to the Board 
as a finished, operating project. 
Nothing further has come of it.” 
“You mean the Board knows 
where this thing is and still lets me 
come looking for you and — ” 

“They may not know the loca- 
tion. I’m not sure the present Board 
knows anything; I don’t know whait 
was done with the earlier recordsi 
by their predecessors. The last time 
was over fifteen years ago.” 

“You know all this for fact?“ 
“Objectively, no. I’ve read it in 
what seem credible reports. I’m not 
qualified as a historical researcher 
and didn’t make professional tests. 
It all seems very probable to me.” 

“It doesn’t to me. Have you told 
ail this to Marie?” 

“Yes.” 

“Does she believe it?” 

“She doesn’t believe anything I 
say since I told her that Joey has 
never been here. She claims I’m 
a dirty liar and a traitor to man- 
kind and an immoral skunk and 
that we disposed of Joe because he 
wouldn’t swallow our ridiculous 
falsehood.” 



128 



IF 




“Would I be able to talk to her?” 

“You’d have my blessing, but I 
don’t see how. She’s a long way 
from here, since her sub arrived 
at a different entrance. I don’t think 
it would be possible to get your* 
tank there without taking you out- 
side again; it would take longer 
than you can spare, and I’d have 
trouble finding enough people to 
get you carried. 

“Can’t whoever runs this place 
assign a crew?” 

“How do you think we’re run? 
There isn’t anyone who could or- 
der a person to do such a thing, 
since it’s more for your pleasure 
and convenience than public neces- 
sity. Besides, I told you there isn’t 
time.” 

I pvondered that for a little while. 

His remark about how the in- 
stallation was run was a little sur- 
prising, but this was hardly the time 
to go into local poilitics. He’d started 
to give me a more interesting im- 
pression, anyway; if what he’d said 
could be credited, it seemed almost 
as though it would be 'better for 
these people if Marie and I left 
than if we stayed. Why was the 
choice being offered, ithen? I asked 
Bert, a little indirectly. 

“What will your friends do if I 
don’t go back up? More people will 
come to look for me, you know. 
Even if I hadn’t reached the sur- 
face and started my rescue set, 
which I did, the Board knows where 
I was going and why.” 

He shrugged again. “No one cares 
how many come down. Unless 
there’s a whole fleet at once, we 



can pull ’em iiQ land jgive them the 
same ohoioo we’re living you. It’s 
happened often enough, as I js^d.” 

“And suppose a whole fleet does 
come and starts wrecking those 
lights and that tent or whatever it 
is without wasting time looking for 
me or Marie or anyone else? Sooner 
or later if folks keep disappearing 
down here that’s what will hap- 
pen.” 

“I’m not m on all the thoughts 
of the Council here,” he answered, 
“and I don’t know whether they’ve 
thought much of (that point. I re- 
peat, there have been quite a few 
people who stayed down here with- 
out getting the Board very excited. 
Personally, I think they’d just put 
this part of the Pacific off limits 
to the general public long before 
they’d waste energy sending a fleet 
of subs down here. In any case, 
that’s the Council’s worry. The cur- 
rent point is that you and Marie 
do have the choice and will have 
to make it of your own free will.” 

“What if I refuse to commit my- 
self?” 

“Once you’ve been told what is 
necessary, we’M simply turn you 
loose at the gate you came in by. 
You’re hardly in a position to hang 
on and refuse to go up. No prob- 
lem.” He gestured toward the di- 
rection from which we had come 
along the tunnel. “Speaking for my- 
self, I’d like to have you stay — 
and Marie, of course. I do have 
some good friends down here now, 
but they’re not quite the same as 
old ones.” 

I thought for a few seconds more 
and then tried to catch his eye 



OCEAN ON TOP 



129 




through the poUrt I asked the 

“JMfe did you decide to stay 
dowtt jper 

He tiw|3y shook his head. 

“Y^qu mean it’s too long to ex- 
plain now, or you don’t want to 
tell me, or something else?” I per- 
sisted. 

He held up one finger, then three, 
but still wrote nothing. 

“In other words, I’m going to have 
to make up my mind entirely on 
my own.” He nodded emphatically. 
“And Marie, too?” He nodded again. 

I could think of only one more 
question likely to be helpful, and 
I threw it at him. 

“Bert, could you go back up above 
now if you changed your mind 
about staying? Or is what they did 
to let you breathe water impossible 
to reverse?” 

H e smiled and used the stylus 
again. 

“We’re not breathing water; that 
analysis misses on two counts. They 
did make an irreversible change, but 
it’s not a very serious one. I could 
still live at the surface, though the 
sihift back to air “breathing would 
be somewhat lengthy and compli- 
cated.” 

“You just said you weren’t breath- 
ing water!” 

“I repeat it. I’m not.” 

‘^ut you just said — ” He held 
up hand to stop me and began 
writing again. 

“I’m not trying to tantalize you. 
The Council isn’t dictatorial by na- 
ture, or even very firm, but it feels 
^^iongly and unanimousily that the 

ido 



details of how we live here shouldn’t 
be discussed wiith. anyone who hasn’t 
committed himself to staying. I 
may have said moire than they’d 
strictly like already, and I’m not 
going any farther.*’ 

“Do ^e people out there with 
you disagree with the Council?” 

“No. The feding on that point 
is pretty uniform among the popu- 
lace.” 

“Then why did you take the 
chance of telling me as much as 
you did?” 

“Most of them were in no posi- 
tion to see what I wrote, none of 
them could have read it, and none 
of them can understand your spok- 
en words.” 

“Then the native language here 
isn’t — ” 

“It isn’t.” He’d cut me off again 
with a wave of his 'hand before I 
even named a language. 

“Then why do you worry about 
disobeying this Council on the 
matter of telling me things?” 

“Because I think they’re perfect- 
ly right.” 

That was a hard one to argue, 
and I didn’t try. After a minute or 
so, he wrote another message. 

“I have work to do and have 
to go now, but I’ll be back every 
hour or two. If you really need 
me bady, pound on your tank — 
not too hard, please. Even if no 
one is in sight, which isn’t likely, 
you can be heard for a long dis- 
tance, and someone will send for 
me. Think it over carefully; I’d like 
you to stay, but not if you’re not 
sure you want to.” He laid the clip 
board down beside the tank, and 



IF 




swam off. Quite a few of the others 
also disappeared, though they didn’t 
all take the same tunnel. The small 
number remaining seemed to be 
those who had arrived most re- 
cently and hadn’t yet given their 
eyes a real fill of the tank. They 
did nothing either interesting or dis- 
tracting, though, and 1 was able 
to buckle down to heavy thinking. 
There was plenty of it to do, and 
Tm rather slow at the business 
sometimes. 

T here was no problem about the 
decision, of course. Naturally 
I would have to go back to report. 

Staying here might, as Bert had 
said, merely pass the buck to an- 
other investigator, but sending an- 
other one down would be a clear 
waste of power no matter what 
trick they dreamed up to get him 
there. Also, I wasn’t nearly as sure 
as Bert seemed to be that the Board 
wouldn’t waste a few tons of ex- 
plosive on this place if they found 
it and had reason to believe it had 
killed off three of their agents. The 
problem was not whether to go 
back, but when; and the “when” de- 
pended on what I could manage to 
do first. 

What I wanted to do was make' 
contact with Marie. It would also 
be nice to find out more about Joey, 
if information of any sort was to 
be had. I didn’t want to believe that 
Bert had lied about him, and it 
was certainly possible that Marie’s 
disbelief stemmed from her reluc- 
tance to accept the idea that Joe 
had disappeared in a genuine acci- 
dent. On the other hand, she was 



by no means stupid. I had to allow 
for the possibility that she might 
have better reasons for doubting 
Bert. 

Joe, like Marie, had had a one- 
man sub. He could have found out 
things these people did not want 
known at the surface. After all, 
what they seemed to want Marie 
and me to carry back if we went 
was information, or propaganda, de- 
signed to discourage the Board from 
checking further. 

But wait a minute. That was true 
only if Bert were right about the 
Board’s preferring to hide the word 
of what went on down here. 

If he were wrong — if my own 
admittedly prejudiced idea of the 
reaction were closer to the truth — 
there’d be no question of suppres- 
sion, and the Board would be down 
raiding this place within a day of 
(the time either of us got back. That 
could hardly be wanted by this 
“Council” Bert was talking about. 
Maybe there really was something 
in what he had said. 

But there still could be things 

these people didn’t want known, 
whether they were feeding Bert a 
line about the Board or not. Joey 
could be here or could have been 
killed, though the latter went very 
much against the grain to believe. 
Even if Bert had been right about 

his never arriving — perhaps 

especially if he were — there was 
Marie to worry about, too. If she 
were feeling stubborn she’d never 

leave of her own free wDl, and 
they couldn’t just turn her loose 
to float up, the way they could me. 
She had a sub. Of course, now that 



OCEAN ON TOP 



131 




I was here they could cripple her 
boat, make sure it was low on bal- 
last, and turn us adrift at the same 
time; maybe I should wait for that. 
Maybe — 

If you’re getting confused by the 
way I tell all this you have an idea 
of the way I felt. If you remember 
that my memory has done some 
editing and organizing since all this 
actually happened, you may have 
an even better idea.' It got to be 
more than I felt like taking. I sud- 
denly realized that I hadn’t had 
much sleep for a long, long time. 
The tank wasn’t a comfortable place 
for that, but there are times when 
one doesn’t bother with trifles. I 
slep^. 

X 

I got in a good, solid eight hours, 
according to the clock. When I 
woke up, it was with the conviction 
that I couldn’t plan anything until 
I had figured out how these people 
managed to live as they did, what 
would have to be done to me if I 
agreed to stay and most particular- 
ly what I would have to arrange to 
do myself if, after agreeing to 
stay and being processed, I chose to 
leave. 

Bert had made it clear that he 
wasn’t going to tell me, but he had 
admitted saying a little more than 
he should have, so there might be 
a chance of my figuring it out for 
myself. 

My memory is supposed to be 
good. Just what had he said that 
might mean anything? 

The most striking remark was his 



denial that he was breathing water. 
Also, there had been something else 
in that sentence — what was it? — 
“that analysis misses on two counts.” 
What could that mean? 

Grammatically speaking, the most 
obvious implication of the first 
phrase was that the liquid now 
around us wasn’t water. Was this 
possible? And if it were, was there 
any other evidence? 

Yes, to both. 

Many liquids don’t mix well with 
water — non-polar liquids in gen- 
eral. Carbon tetrachloride and all 
the oils, to name familiar ones. How- 
ever, if this were such a liquid it 
must be at least as dense as water 
and probably denser. Not the gen- 
eral run of oils, therefore. Not car- 
bon tet, either, since it’s highly 
poisonous. The density had to be 
high because there was no door or 
valve between this place and the 
ocean, and oil would have floated 
to the surface of the Pacific and 
been spotted long ago. 

On that basis, the interface be- 
tween water and my hypothetical 
liquid would probably be at the 
entrance. Memory supported the 
idea. 

As the tank had reached the level 
of the pit’s mouth on the way in, 
the subs had hooked more ballast 
to it — obviously necessary if the 
new liquid were denser than water 
and the tank were just barely heavy 
enough to sink in the latter. The 
swimmers, too, had taken on more 
ballast — those “tool kits!” Of 
course. If they had been tools, why 
put them on coming in from the 
sea bottom? Or if outside were a 



132 



IF 




place for recreation only and tools 
Vere only used inside, why not keep 
them at the place they were used? 
If there had been room in the tank, 
I'd have kicked myself for not see- 
ding that sooner — or rather, for 
not following up the doubts I had 
had at the time. 

All right, first working hypothe- 
sis. We’re in a non-polar, non- 
poisonous liquid, somewhat denser 
than water. I think I see why, but 
let’s not be too hasty. 

So that was the second point on 
which my analysis had been wrong. 
The people, as Bert had said, weren’t 
breathing water — because they 
weren’t in water and because they 
weren’t breathing. I still had trouble 
believing it, but the logic went 
marching on. 

T he basic idea was clear enough. 

If people didn’t breathe, they 
didn’t need gas in their lungs. If 
they didn’t have gas in their lungs, 
they wouldn’t be bothered by pres- 
sure changes. Well, qualify that. 
They’d have to fill their middle 
ears and sinuses with liquid, too. 
If the liquid had about the same 
compressibility as water (question: 
why not use water? Tabled for later 
consideration) then a change in 
depth would mean no significant 
volume change in any part of the 
j3ody. 

A few details needed filling in, 
though. Granted that it would be 
convenient to be able to do without 
t)reathing, how was it managed? 

Well, why does one breathe, any- 
way? To get oxygen into the blood. 
Will anything do as a substitute for 



oxygen.^ Categorically no. E’emenc 
number eight is the one and only, 
oxidizing agent the human metabo- 
lism is geared to use — and “gear- 
ed” is a rather good word in thac 
connection. 

But does the oxygen have to come 
in gas form? Maybe not. If my 
schooling hasn’t gone by the board, 
hemoglobin is only interested in O- 
two molecules, not oxide or per- 
oxide ions or ozone; but up to the 
time the stuff is delivered to the 
hemoglobin some of the others are 
at least conceivable. The first 
thought would be some sort of 
food or drink. Could something be 
taken into the stomach which would 
release oxygen molecules? Certainly. 
There was hydrogen peroxide. The 
oxygen released didn’t start as dia- 
tomic molecules, though it got to 
•that state quickly enough. I couldn’t 
picture anyone in his right mind 
drinking a slug of peroxide, for 
several reasons, but the principle 
seemed defendable so far. 

Could the oxygen get from the 
stomach to the blood stream? Not 
directly, but it could take the same 
path as the other foods. Into the 
small intestine and through the villi. 

I seemed to remember that there 
is a lot less absorbing surface here 
than in the lungs, but under the 
pressure of this depth that might 
not be a serious lack. 

Working hypothesis two, there- 
fore, is that these folks eat or drink 
something that gives off oxygen 
gradually. If, under this pressure, the 
gas always remained in solution, the 
body would still be relatively indif- 
ferent to pressure change. Though 



OCEAN ON TOP 



133 




my outside passenger of a few hours 
back might have been in serious 
trouble after all if he’d gone all 
the way to the surface with me. 

How about carbon dioxide elim- 
ination? No problem. Out through 
the lungs, as usual, and into im- 
mediate solution in the surrounding 
liquid. Maybe that was why the 
liquid wasn’t water; they might be 
using something that took up CO2 
better, though under this pressure 
water certainly should be adequate. 
Of course, with body fluids under 
the same pressure, it might be more 
a matter of complex ion equilibrium 
than simple solubility; perhaps pH 
control had been necessary. It cer- 
tainly was inside the body, and this 
whole idea seemed to be lessening 
the differences between inside and 
out. 

A ll this suggested that if I chose 
to stay down here, they would 
presumably start pressurizing me. 
Sometime during the process I’d be 
given a meal, or a drink, of the 
oxygen source. That, as far as I 
could see, would be it, barring minor 
meohanical tricks for filling my si- 
nuses and middle ears with liquid. 

How about getting back to breath- 
ing habits? The pressure would have 
to come down again. The oxygen 
source in the stomach — yes, that 
would present a difficulty. If it were 
still giving off the stuff, and pres- 
sure got down near one atmosphere 
— hmph. Very close timing, doing 
the job just as the stomach oxygen 
ran out? Mechanical assistance such 
as .an artificial lung between the time 
the inside source gave out and nat- 



ural breathing was resumed? Either 
way, it would be difficult for me 
to manage alone, if the need ever 
arose. 

In any case, I could now do some 
tentative planning, always realizing 
my hypothesis might be all wet. I 
was fond of them, though, and felt 
that it would be at most a case of 
having to modify details as more in- 
formation came in. It was a pleasant 
sensation while it lasted. 

Under the circumstances, then, it 
seemed best to tell Bert that I was 
staying and waste as little time as 
possible getting out of this bub- 
ble so I could do something useful. 
I’d developed my own moral stand- 
ards — made my private Loyalty 
Oath to Mankind, if you like — 
long ago, so there’d be no conscience 
question if they wanted me to make 
some sort of local declaration be- 
fore they’d accept me. Probably they 
wouldn’t; things like that had been 
worn too thin to be meaningful 
back in the days when people 
thought their chief danger was poli- 
tical difference rather than energy 
shortage. Lodges and similar private 
groups still used formal oaths,/ but 
even these didn’t carry quite the 
same implications that they used to. 

I wondered suddenly why my 
mind was wandering off in that di- 
rection — after all, my plan might 
be a little deceitful, but it was in a 
good cause, and my conscience was 
clear enough — and got back to 
immediate problems. 

Details, of course, would still have , 
to wait. I’d have to learn the local 
geography, especially the way to 
Marie’s submarine. I’d have to find 



134 



IF 




out just how much freedom of action 
I was going to be allowed. Bert 
seemed to come and go at will, but 
he’d been here for a year. In that 
connection, probably I’d be expected 
to earn my living in some fashion; 
if finding out the details I needed 
and working up a plan to get Marie 
and me back to the surface, all took 
very long then I’d probably have to 
do something of the sort. What sort 
of work would be both useful down 
here and within my powers was 
something else for the future to tell. 

Right now, then, the thing to do 
was wait for Bert, or send for him, 
and give him the word. Waiting 
would probably be better. There was 
no point in looking too eager. He’d 
said he’d be around often, and no 
doubt had been while I was asleep. 
He’d be bound to expect me to 
wake up before long. 

I waited, like a monkey in a zoo 
— or perhaps more like a fish in an 
aquarium. 

XI 

I t was about half an hour before 
he .showed up. He glanced in 
through one of the ports, saw that 
I was conscious and picked up the 
writing pad. 

“Been doing any thinking?” was 
his opener. I nodded affirmatively. 
“Good. Made up your mind?” 

“I lliink so,” I called back. “I — ” 
I hesitated. Part of it was for effect, 
but part of it was genuine uncertain- 
ty. I could be wrong in so many 
ways. Then I stiffened up. 

“I’m staying.” 

He looked a little surprised and 



started to write. I went on before 
he had finished. “At least. I’m stay- 
ing if you can tell me one thing 
for certain.” 

He cleared his pad and looked at 
me expectantly. 

“Do you genuinely believe — I’m 
not asking do you know, just do you 
believe — that these people are 
justified in keeping out of the power 
net and the rationing system?” 

Bert’s face took on an annoyed 
expression as he wrote. 

“I told you you’d have to make 
up your mind by yourself. I won’t 
take the responsibility.” 

“I expect to make it up myself,” 
I retorted, “but not without data. 
You say there’s too little time for 
you to tell me everything I’d like 
to know, and I’m arguing that. I’m 
asking for a conclusion of yours, 
not even a piece of information 
you’re not supposed to give me, just 
a conclusion — an opinion — as a 
summary of information I can’t get. 
Did you make your decision on as 
little knowledge as I have now?” 

He shook his head negatively. 
“Then I’m sorry if you read my 
question as a reflection on your 
morals, but I still want an answer.” 
He frowned thoughtfully for half 
a minute or so and looked at me a 
little doubtfully. I repeated my ques- 
tion, to be sure he understood. 

“I really do believe they have 
the right idea,” he wrote at last. I 
nodded. 

“All right, then I’m staying. How 
long will it take to get me out of 
this coconut shell?” 

“I don’t know.” His writing was 
slow and interrupted by pauses for

thought. “It’s not what you’d call 
a standard procedure. We’re more 
used to our guests coming in sub- 
marines, whidh have pressure locks 
or at least some sort of port. I’ll 
tell the Council, and we’ll hunt up 
some engineers who have time to 
spare. I’m sure it can be done.” 
“You mean — you mean it may 
take a long time? Suppose it takes 
longer than my air supply?” 

“Then I suppose we’ll just have 
to shove you outdoors anyway. If 
you still want to badly enough, you 
can always come back in a sub, the 
way Marie did. I’ll go start things 
moving.” 

“But why didn’t you mention this 
before? I thought — well — ” 
“Some things really shouldn’t 
need mentioning. Where in the 
world would you expect to find 
ready-made equipment for taking a 
man out of a high-pressure escape 
shell while it was still in a high- 
pressure environment? Think it 
over.” He put down the pad and 
was gone before I could think of a 
good answer to that one. 

In fact he had come back, nearly 
an hour later, before I could think 
of one. I still haven’t^ 

B ert, on his return, had better 
news than I had been afraid 
he might. The Council, or such of 
them as he had found — I was get- 
ting on idea that it was a body of 
rather fluid composition, and that 
the usual way of getting things done 
officially was to find and deal with 
one’s own chosen quorum of mem- 
bers — had approved my applica- 
tion for citizenship, if it could be 



called that, with no argument. Sev- 
eral engineers in the group had been 
interested enough in the problem I 
represented to go to work on it at 
once. They were at the task now 
and might be expected to come up 
with something shortly. 

That was encouraging. I’m an en- 
gineer of sorts myself, though I 
work at it only in its incidental con- 
nection with my main job, and 
every idea I had thought of ran 
into a blank wall. This was usually 
a matter of basic procedure. I 
couldn’t see how welding, or high- 
speed drilling, or any of several 
other ordinary operations you take 
for granted in machining and han- 
dling work could be done in a 
liquid environment under a pressure 
of more than a ton to the square 
inch. Most tools, for example, have 
high-speed motors; high-speed mo- 
tors are a little hard to conceive 
with their moving parts bathed in 
an even moderately viscous fluid; 
and under that sort of pressure, how 
do you keep the fluid out? 

Of course, if these people had 
been down here the eighty years or 
so that Bert had mentioned, they 
should have learned the basic tricks 
for the environment, just as men had 
learned space engineering the hard 
way. I wished I knew how they were 
going about my problem, though. 

I didn’t find out in detail, but it 
didn’t take them too long. About 
eighteen hours — a very boring 
eighteen hours — after Bert had 
brought the news, he came back 
with a team of helpers and began 
moving the tank. It was quite a trip. 
We went back outside and travelled 



136 



IF 




half a mile or so to another, larger 
entrance. Inside it there were sev- 
eral large corridors, instead of just 
one, opening from the main cham- 
ber. 

They towed me down one of 
these for a distance and stopped by 
a pair of the first genuine locks I 
had seen since my arrival. 

One was quite ordinary, and I 
barely glanced at it; the other was 
circular and just about large enough 
for my tank. It was located in the 
same wall as the smaller lock, about 
twenty yards away from it. It was 
opened as we approached by a 
couple of the party who swam on 
ahead, and the tank was juggled 
through. The wall in which the door 
was hung turned out to be several 
feet thick, and the door itself but 
little thinner; I judged that the 
room beyond was the one to be 
depressurized. 

The chamber itself was fairly 
large. One side was crowded with 
apparatus, the most recognizable 
items being an operating table with 
broad restraining straps and a set 
of remote-control hands much finer 
than I was used to seeing on work 
subs. 

The larger part of the room, 
in which the tank had been placed, 
was almost bare, and it looked very 
much as though the operating room 
had originally been much smaller. 
There were signs that a wall as 
thick as the one I had come through 
had been removed from between the 
spot where I now was and the place 
where the table and its auxiliary 
gear stood. I would have liked to 
see the tools that had done the job. 



M y guess, as it turned out, was 
correct; the smaller section had 
been the original conversion room; 
the smaller lock leading into it could 
be connected to the hatch of a visit- 
ing sub. The whole trouble had been 
that my tank had no hatch; it nor- 
mally opened by bisection. 

Bert wrote instructions for me 
while the others were getting out 
of the place. 

“When we’re all gone and the 
door is sealed, the room will be 
pumped down to surface pressure. A 
green light will flash over the table 
when it’s down, but you’ll know 
anyway — you’ll be able to open 
your tank. When you can get out, 
go over to the table and get onto 
it. Fasten the straps around your 
body and legs. It doesn’t matter 
whether your arms are free or not. 
When you’re tight to the table, 
press the red signal button you can 
see from here.” He indicated the 
button to me. “It’s within reach of 
your right hand, you see. A con- 
tainer of sleeping medicine will be 
delivered by one of the hands. Drink 
it and relax. Nothing more can 
be done while you’re conscious.” 
“Why not?” 

“You’ll have to be plugged into a 
heart-lung machine during the 
change. Don’t worry. It’s been done 
many times before. Once you’re out 
of that tank and onto the table, 
the only unusual problem you offer 
will have been solved. All right?” 
“I see. All right.” He put down 
his pad and swam out through the 
ponderous lock, which swung slow- 
ly shut. I hadn’t seen any special 
dogs or clamps on it, but it opened 



OCEAN ON TOP 



137 




out into the corridor and wouldn’t 
need any. With its area, once the 
pressure started down in the room 
nothing much short of an earth- 
quake could open it. 

I could tdl when the pumps start- 
ed; the whole place quivered, and 
the vibration carried through to the 
tank very easily. I spent some time 
estimating the work that would have 
to be done to empty a room of this 
volume against a one-mile bead of 
sea water and a little more in won- 
dering how the mysterious fluid that 
was replacing water would behave 
when ^e pressure came down. If 
it -had a high vapor pressure there 
would be a purging job <mi top of 
the pumping one — no, not neces- 
sarily, come to .think of it; the 
stuff must be physiologically harm- 
less, so probably the vapor could be 
left in the room. Of course if it 
were flammable it might make trou- 
ble when they put oxygen in for me 
to breathe. Well, they were used 
to that problem and had been for 
decades. I needn’t worry about it. 

In spite of all the free energy 
which seemed to be around, it took 
nearly half an hour to empty the 
place. The liquid level went down 
steadily. The surface, when it ap- 
peared, remained smooth. There was 
no boiling or other special behavior. 
It might as well have been water. 
They took no pains to get the last 
oi it out; there were several puddles 
on the rather uneven floor when the 
light flashed. 

I wasted no time opening the tank; 
I’d been in it for a long time and 
couldn’t get out too fast. My ears 
hurt for a moment as the hemi- 



spheres fell apart; pressures had not 
been perfectly matched, but the 
difference wasn’t enough to be se- 
rious. Once out I slowed down. My 
arms and legs were badly cramped, 
and I found it almost impossible for 
a few moments to walk even as far 
as the table. I spent several minutes 
working the kinks out of my limbs 
before I took the next step. 

The table was comfortable. Any- 
thing I could have stretched out on, 
including the stone floor, would have 
been comfortable just then. I fas- 
tened the broad, w^bed strap about 
my waist and chest, then of course 
found I couldn’t reach down to the 
ones for my legs. I undid the first 
set, took care of my legs, refastened 
the upper strap and finally was 
ready to push the signal switch. 

As promised, one of the mechan- 
ical hands promptly extended to- 
ward me with a beaker of liquid 
and a flexible tube to let me drink 
it lying down. I followed orders, 
and that’s all I remember about the 
process. 

XII 

I woke up with a reasonably clear 
head. I was lying on a bunk in a 
small room that contained two other 
beds and nothing much else. No 
one else was around. 

Someone had removed my clothes, 
but they were folded in a sort of 
hybrid offspring of a laundry basket 
and a letter rack near the head of 
the bunk. Another similar affair held 
a pair of trunks such as I had seen 
worn by many of the men around 
my tank. After a moment’s thought 



138 



IF 




I put an the trunks; my other gar- 
ments weren’t made for swimming. 
I got out of the bunk and stood 
on the floor, though my head felt 
a little funny. 

It occuiT^ to me that I had 
no business feeling enough weight 
to let me stand, under the drcum- 
slances; I was presumably immersed 
in a liquid denser than water, and 
therefore denser than my body. A 
thought crossed my mind; I rum- 
maged in -the ipockets of my old 
clothes, found a jacknife, and let 
go of it. 

Sure enough, it fell past my face. I 
was standing on the ceiling, as 
were the bunks. 

I tried swimming after the knife, 
which had come to rest a couple 
of feet out of reach on the floor/ 
ceiling. It was quite an effort, though 
not by any means impossible. It 
was obvious why the people I had 
seen wore the ballast belts. I didn’t 
see any of those around, though; 
for the moment at least. I’d have to 
walk if 1 wanted to go anywhere. 
This promised to be rather incon- 
venient too, since the liquid was 
fairly viscous, though less so than 
water. Also, the architecture wasn’t 
designed for walkers; one of the 
doors to the room was in a wall and 
fairly accessible, but the other was 
in the floor — that is, the floor 
toward which my head was now 
pointing and on which my jackknife 
had come to rest. Under the cir- 
cumstances I decided to wait until 
Bert or someone showed up with 
ballast and swim fins. 

The decision was helped by the 



fact that I still didn’t feel quite 
myself, even aside from the diker- 
ence of opinion between my eyes and 
my semicircular canals as to which 
way was up and which was down. 
As a matter of fact, the canals 
couldn’t seem to make up their 
minds at all on the matter, and it 
suddenly occurred to me that some 
surgery must have been done there 
as well. They could not possibly 
have been left half full of air — or 
could they? How strong was bone, 
and how well surrounded by it were 
the canals, anyway? 

I felt around and found several 
places on my neck and around my 
ears where the smooth plastic of 
surgical dressing covered the skin, 
but that didn’t prove much. It had 
bo&a obvious all along that some 
work around the ears would be nec- 
essary. 

I felt no desire to breathe; they 
must have slipped a supply of their 
oxygen-food into me sometime dur- 
ing the procedure. I wondered how 
long it would last. 

It suddenly occurred to me that 
I was very much in the power of 
anyone who chose to exercise it, 
since I hadn’t the faintest idea where 
to get more of the stuff. That was 
something I’d have to discuss with 
Bert very shortly. 

I tried forcing myself to breathe. 
I found I could squeeze liquid slowly 
out of my lungs and get it back 
equally slowly, but it hurt and made 
me feel even dizzier than being right 
side up and upside down simultan- 
eously. The liquid went into my 
windpipe; I could feel it, but there 



140 



IF 




was no tendency to cough. I still 
think that must have been one of 
the trickiest parts of the conver- 
sion procedure, considering the 
nerve and muscle activity which 
coughing involves. 

T he presence of liquid in my 
windpide, expected as it was, 
raised another question. I certainly 
couldn’t talk, and I didn’t know the 
sign language which appeared to be 
standard here — didn’t even know 
the spoken language on which it was 
presumably based. I had a long job 
ahead of me if I were to communi- 
cate with the local inhabitants. May- 
be it would be better to bypass any 
such effort; if I could find out all 
I needed to know from Bert, lan- 
guage lessons would be a waste of 
time. 

I could hear, though. The sounds 
were almost all strange, though some 
might have been the hum of high- 
speed motors or generators. There 
were whistles, thus, whines — near- 
ly everything there is a word for, 
hut none of it exactly similar to 
anything familiar, and one partic- 
ular class of noise completely miss- 
ing. The gabble of speech which 
drenches every other inhabited part 
of Earth was totally lacking. 

Nearly an hour passed, according 
to my watch, before anyone ap- 
peared (the watch itself was a 
solid-state radioactive-powered af- 
fair which had not b^n designed 
with sea-bottom pressure in mind, 
but had come through the change 
perfectly). I spent most of the time 
cursing myself — not for making 
the change, but for failing to take 



advantage of the time between de- 
cision and action by getting more 
information from Bert. 

The new arrival was young and 
quite decorative — but I didn’t fall 
in love with her. The response was 
mutual. She waved me back to the 
cot and examined my dressings with 
an air of competence. 

When she finished, I tried to call 
her attention to my lack of swim- 
ming ballast. She may have under- 
stood, since she paid courteous at- 
tention to me and nodded agreeably 
after I’d finished my gestures, but 
she left without doing anything con- 
structive about the matter. I hoped 
she was going to call Bert. 

W hether she did or not, he was 
the next to enter. He had no 
extra ballast with him, but he did 
have the writing pad. 'Ms was even 
better. I reached for it and buckled 
down to work. 

I’d been restricted to communicat- 
ing only by written note before, but 
not since leaving grammer school. In 
those days it had had a certain thrill, 
being an illicit activity in study hall; 
now it proved to be purest nuisance. 

In something over two hours, we 
settled: 

That I was a fully naturalized 
citizen of this place, and entitled 
to go where I pleased and do what 
I wanted short of obvious conflict 
with the interests of others; 

That I was not only permitted to 
examine the power-generating units, 
but was expected to familiarize my- 
self with them as soon as possible; 

That I could visit Marie at her 
submarine whenever 1 felt like it, 



OCEAN ON TOP 



141 




and I had the blessing of the Coun- 
cil and the rest of the population 
in arguing wilh her; and 

That I would be expected to sup- 
port myself by farming until I dem- 
onstrated some different and at least 
equally useful way of contributing 
to the general welfare. 

That was all. Often in the past 
I’d held a lengthy conversation with 
someone, and after he was out of 
sight had remembered other things 
I’d wanted to say; but down here 
this sort of thing wasn’t an incident, 
it was a habit. 

It wasn’t so much that one for- 
got to bring up some point or other. 
As a rule there wasn’t time to cover 
even the ones remembered. I’ve nev- 
er appreciated the gift of speech so 
much in my life. Those of you who 
feel, after finishing this report, that 
I should have learned certain key 
facts sooner than I did will please 
remember this difficulty. I don’t say 
I shouldn’t have been quicker, but 
I do claim some excuse for my fail- 
ure. 

The whole thing was not merely 
annoying; it did wind up making 
me look more like a plain fool than 
I ever have before or hope to again. 
What is really embarrassing is that 
so many people who have heard 
only this much of the story can see 
already where I went wrong. 

I had no real enthusiasm for farm- 
ing, though I was curious about how 
it would be conducted on the sea 
bottom. I did want to learn about 
the power plant, but even that item 
I postponed. I asked Bert first of 
;all to guide me to Marie’s sub. He 
nodded and started swimming. 



'^he trip was made without con- 
A versation. Maybe Bert was used 
enough to swimming by this time 
so that he could have written and 
read while doing it, like a city secre- 
tary doing a crossword puzzle as she 
strolls out to lunch, but I certainly 
was not. I simply looked around as 
I followed him, noting everything I 
possibly could. 

The tunnels were long and for 
the most part straight, but they 
formed a hopeless maze as far as I 
was concerned. I would be a long, 
long time learning to find my way 
around unaided. If there was any- 
thing corresponding to an ordinary 
street sign, I failed to spot it. There 
were all sorts of color patterns on 
the walls, but I couldn’t tell whether 
they meant something or were mere- 
ly decoration. Everything was bright- 
ly lighted. 

The place wasn’t just tunnels, 
either. There were large rooms of 
all shapes, some of which might have 
been business plazas or shopping 
centers or theaters or almost any- 
thing else one can think of where 
a lot of people congregate. I seldom 
saw any real crowds, but there were 
enough swimmers around to support 
>the claim that the population was 
quite large — not surprising if it had 
been going for several generations. 
I was gradually coming to think 
of the place as a country, as Bert 
had claimed, rather than an outlaw 
organization; a country which had 
never lost its identity by subscrib- 
ing to the Power Code. This might 
indeed be the case — it might have 
been here longer than the Code had. 
I didn’t know how much more than 



142 



IF 




the eighty years Bert had mentioned 
might be in its history. That was 
something else to find out. 

I never got good at judging dis- 
tances in swimming, and some of 
the corridors had their traffic as- 
sisted by a pump-driven current, 
so I don’t know how far we went 
before reaching the submarine. As 
a matter of fact, I still have only 
the vaguest notion of the size of the 
whole place. At any rate* we final- 
ly emerged from a naiTow corridor 
into one of the big chambers under 
an ocean entrance, crossed beneath 
the circle of blackness which gave 
on a mile of salt water, went on 
down a much larger passageway for 
perhaps two hundred yards, and 
found ourselves at the entrance to 
a fair-sized room in which one or- 
dinary Board work sulb, loaded with 
external ballast slugs as my tank had 
been, lay cradled on the floor. 

Bert stopped just outside the en- 
trance and began to write. I read 
over his shoulder as he produced, 
“I’d better stay outside. She’s firm- 
ly convinced that I’m Judas Iscariot, 
Benedict Arnold and Vidkun Quis- 
ling all rolled into one. You’ll have 
enough trouble appearing as you are 
without me beside you. Have you 
decided what excuse to offer for 
making the change?” 

I nodded, seeing no need to waste 
time writing out details more than 
once, and took the pad and stylus. 
Bert looked a little expectant, but 
I waved farewell to him and headed 
for the sub. When I looked back, 
just before reaching it, he was gone. 
I then remembered that sometime 
fairly soon I was going to need 



ordinaiy food and presumably, even 
more seriously, the oxygen food. Z 
still didn’t know where to get ^em. 

XIII 

I couldn’t see anyone through the 
ports of the sub as I approached, 
though I circled all the way around 
it. Apparently Marie was asleep. I 
wasn’t sure* it would be sound policy 
to wake her up, but I finally de- 
cided to take a chance. I tapped on 
the hull. 

“If that’s Bert, clear out. I’m 
busy thinking!” The words were 
clear and understandable, but they 
didn’t sound at all like Marie’s 
voice. I can’t describe just what 
they did sound like. There are 
overtones produced by the human 
vocal cords which don’t usually get 
through the imped ance-matchingj 
equipment of the listener’s middle- 
ear — one of the reasons one’s own 
voice sounds so unfamiliar in a re- 
cording. Being immersed in a fluid 
which carries sound at about the 
same speed as water does, and hav- 
ing that fluid on both sides of the 
ear drum, makes an even greater dif- 
ference. As I say, I personally lack 
the words to describe the exact result. 

I tapped again. The second re- 
sponse was equally dear, but I’ve 
promised Marie not to quote it. I 
got annoyed, and my third tap came 
os close to pounding as (the liquid 
envircwiment permitted. That was a 
mistake. 

A man can stand the explosion 
of a stick of dynamite a hundred 
feet away, in air, quite easily.. The 
noise is uncomfortable but not by 



OCEAN ON TOP 



143 




itself dangerous. If he’s swimming 
at thait distance from the same stick 
when it detonates under water, 
though, he can count on being kill- 
ed. 

My fist didn’t pack the energy of 
a stick of dynamite, but things 
might have been less painful if it 
had. At least I’d have been com- 
fortably dead. My eardrums didn’t 
actually break when the shock wave 
hit them, but the sensations can’t 
have been much different. I was 
long in recovering to permit Marie 
to come to the port, recognize me, 
get over whatever shock the recogni- 
tion may have caused her and 
freeze up again. 

She claims now that she was glad 
to see me for the first half second 
or so. She says she even yelled my 
name, in spite of my known feel- 
ing about that. By the time I was 
aware of my surroundings again, 
though, she was certainly showing 
no sign of pleasure. She was glaring 
at me. I could see her lips moving, 
but I couldn’t yet hear her words 
over the ringing and pounding still 
in my ears. I held my hands over 
them for a moment and tried to 
signal her to wait, but her lips kept 
right on moving. 

I gave up on the signals and got 
to work with the stylus. By the 
time I had filled the sheet with writ- 
ing, I was beginning to make out 
her words. They made it clear why 
Bert had preferred not to stay 
with me. Angry as she was, though, 
she was stiU sane enough to pause 
and read what I had written when 
I held it up to the port. The words 



had been carefully planned, on the 
basis of what Bert had told me about 
her current attitude. 

What I wrote was, “Don’t say 
anything likely to get me in trou- 
ble with these people. Why did you 
stay down here?” That was sup- 
posed to divert her attention from 
the question of why I was here my- 
self, apparently enjoying all local 
rights and privileges. It might even 
give her the thought that I was 
playing spy. It was partly successful; 
at least, the strong language stopped, 
and she took time out to think be- 
fore she spoke again. 

T hen she answered, “I’m here to 
find Joey. He disappeared down 
here — you know that as well as 
I do. I’m staying here until I know 
what’s become of him.” 

“Wouldn’t there be some point in 
going up to tell the Board about 
this place?” I asked. “Then a really 
well manned force could come down 
and accomplish something construc- 
tive.” 

“I thought of that,” she admitted, 
“but when Bert told me I could go 
back and report everything I knew, 
I was sure there was some trick be- 
hind it. Besides, I was more worried 
about Joe, and they wouldn’t tell me 
anything about him.” 

“Didn’t Bert say you could stay 
if you wanted?” 

“Yes. That’s what made me sus- 
picious. How could any decent per- 
son agree to stay here? It was just 
a trick to help make sure I couldn’t 
go back. Once you’re changed to 
breathe water, you can’t change 
back, obviously.”

I almost pointed out that the li- 
quid wasn’t water, and then I almost 
asked what was obvious about her 
conclusion. I realized that the first 
point was irrelevant and that she’d 
dismiss it as quibbling, and the sec- 
ond was likely to bring up the sub- 
ject of my own conversion. Besides, 
any argument was likely to force 
me to use information I’d have to 
admit came from Bert, so she prob- 
ably wouldn’t 'believe it. 

Come to think of it, I realized with 
a sudden jolt, I had only Bert’s word 
for it that the change was reversible 
to the extent of letting me go back 
to the surface. Well, if he were mis- 
taken or lying to me, it was too late 
now. I was writing again as those 
thoughts flickered through my mind. 

“But what do you expect to ac- 
complish just sitting here in your 
sub? What have you done in the six 
weeks since we last saw you?” She 
ducked that one. 

“I don’t know what I can do here, 
but if I leave I’m shut off from fur- 
ther information. I still hope I can 
get something out of Bert. I’m sure 
he knows where Joey is, even though 
he denies it.” 

“How can you get any word out 
of him if you won’t talk to him? 
You told me to get out just now 
when you thought I was Bert.” 

She grinned, and for just a mo- 
ment looked like the Marie I knew 
back at Papeete. 

“I just think it’s better technique 
to keep him wanting to talk to me” 
was her answer. I couldn’t under- 
stand the rationale of that one, but 
there was much about Marie I’d 
never understood, and she knew it. 



“Well, Tm here now,” I wrote, 
“and whether it turns out to be for 
keeps or not I can at least move 
around and get something done. Sub- 
ject to your approval, I plan to de- 
vote my time to getting information 
which you can take back to the sur- 
face when you go — I assume you 
don’t plan to spend the rest of your 
life here.” 

“I don’t plan it, but I rather ex- 
pect it,” was her reply. Before I 
could write any comment she went 
on, “Of course. I’ll have to give up 
and start back some time, but I know 
they’ll dispose of me when I do. 
That’s assuming they did the same 
with Joe, and I’m very sure they did. 
If I do find him alive, of course, 
what I do will depend on him.” She 
fell silent, and after a moment to 
make sure she had finished I wrote 
again. 

“But you’d like me to find him 
for you.” 

She looked at me with what I 
hoped was a tender and sympathetic 
expression, though I couldn’t be quite 
sure through the port. She knew how 
I felt about her, of course. I’d never 
made any secret of it, and even if 
I’d tried to, a woman would have had 
to be a lot more stupid than Marie 
to miss the evidence. Most of the 
girls in our section are more stupid 
than she, and it’s a standing joke 
with them. 

M arie didn’t answer for several 
seconds, and I decided I still 
had the conversational ball. I re- 
sumed writing. 

“Of course, he’s part of the job 
anyway. I came down to find out

145 




whiat I could albout tibe ithree of you. 
I know about Bert land you, now, but 
the job’s not finished. There are 
other things here to learn. I’ve got 
to pick up the technical information 
that makes this p>lace possible, es- 
pecially its lability to ignore power 
rationing, and there’s a little ques- 
tion which talking to you has 
brought up. If you’re so siure they’ve 
disposed of Joe, and are planning to 
do the same with you when you 
leave, why do you think you’re still 
alive? They could have holed your 
sub without the slightest difficulty — 
or for that matter spared themselves 
the considerable trouble of supply- 
ing you with food and air.” 

“I’ve been thinking about that 
last,” Marie answered, this time with- 
out hesitation. “When I first staged 
this sit-down, it was meant to test 
them on that point — ” She saw me 
start writing and stopped while I 
finished. 

“Weren’t you taking some chances 
with that sort of test?” I asked. “Sup- 
pose they’d failed it. Would you have 
lived to report the results?” 

“Well, no. I wasn’t really caring 
what happened to me about that 
time, but I did think I stood a chance 
of driving out of here and making 
a decent try for the surface, with 
something really worth while to re- 
port.” 

“Marie, I’ve always thought as 
much of your brains as of your other 
qualities, but for the last few min- 
utes you’ve been dithering. You must 
know it. Are you going to give me 
straight data, or do I have to work 
here even more alone than I’d hop- 
ed? I repeat, why do you think they 



haven’t killed or at least starved 
you?” 

T hat was taking a chance, I rea- 
lized, but it worked. She started 
to frown, then fought it off with a 
visible effort, thought for a moment 
with her lips ipursed and then began 
talking more quietly. 

“All right. I didn’t trust any of 
the juice-breathers out there, and I’m 
not sure I trust even you — ” I was 
grateful for the “even” — “but I’ll 
take a chance. I’ve been doing a lot 
of thinking here; I’ve had nothing 
much else to do. I’ve come up with 
one explanation, and I haven’t been 
able to think of any others or find 
any holes in it. It accounts for their 
not killing me and their letting you 
and Bert join them. It suggests that 
Joe might possibly be alive, though 
if he is it doesn’t explain why he 
hasn’t come to see me the way you 
and Bert have.” She paused to think 
for a moment and then went on. 
“It’s quite simple in principle, but it 
could do with some detailed facts. 
That’s one reason I’m telling it to 
you.” She paused again, and looked 
at me hard before going on. 

“They must need us. There’s 
something they’re short of that you, 
and Bert, and Joe, and I, and maybe 
anyone else from the surface can 
supply. It’s the only sensible answer.” 
I pondered that. It was a possibil- 
ity I hadn’t thought of, though I was 
not ready to accept it as the only 
sensible one. 

“You don’t think they might just 
be so pleased with their way of life 
— freedom from power rationing, 
they’d probably call it — that they

just wamt recruits on general prin- 
ciples? That sort of thing has hap- 
pened.” 

“I know it has,” she replied. “But 
I don’t believe it has this time. You 
got that sort of thing back in the 
days of nations and political parties, 
before the Board’s necessity was re- 
alized.” 

“If you think we’ve outgrown pol- 
itics,” I retorted as quickly as the 
stylus would let me, “you’re less alert 
than I thought you were around our 
own office. And what’s wrong with 
regarding this bunch as a nation? It’s 
the picture I’ve been forming of 
them.” 

“Nation? You’ve a short circuit 
between the ears. They’re just an- 
other bunch of power-wasters. There 
aren’t enough of them to be a na- 
tion.” 

“Do you know how many there 
are?” 

“Of course not. I’ve been in no 
position to count. A few hundred, I 
should think.” 

“You think a few hundred people 
could build a place like this? Or even 
a small part of it? There must be 
miles of tunnels here. I swam for the 
best part of an hour to get from 
where they worked on me to this 
place, and it was a maze. I haven’t 
seen any part of their power unit 
yet, but it miust be huge to supply 
all this volume with light, and there’s 
that big tent area outside — you 
must have seen that. How could a 
few hundred people possibly do such 
a job? On the surface, with unlimited 
time and normal construction ma- 
chinery, sure; but what standard ma- 
chinery could have been used here?” 



M arie had wanted to cut in a 
little way back, but waited for 
me to finish. There’s no point in try- 
ing to quote the next few minutes 
verbatim; they boiled down to the 
fact that she hadn’t seen the lighted 
area outside. She’d spotted a work 
sub while she was prowling around 
searching for Joe, had followed it, 
and wound up at an entrance appar- 
ently out of sight of the “tent.” Ap- 
parently there were a lot of entranc- 
es. She had no opinion to offer on 
the lighted area, and I couldn’t help 
feeling that she didn’t entirely 'be- 
lieve my account of it. 

She hadn’t been captured. She’d 
followed the sub to the entrance, 
found she lacked ballast enough to 
get through the interface between 
the liquids and simply stayed there, 
blocking traffic, until they’d loaded 
her down and towed her inside out 
of the way. Women are interesting 
creatures, with interesting powers. I 
wasn’t sure / believed her, but de- 
cided not to tell her so. 

“All right,” I finally summed up 
on the pad. “The jobs for me seem 
to be to find Joe or reliable word of 
him; to find a specific, convincing 
reason why they are so willing or 
eager to have us join them; to get 
reliable information about the size 
and population of the place; and to 
get the technical information about 
their power plant.” 

“Right,” she nodded. “I won’t de- 
mand that you do all that without 
confiding in Bert, because I have no 
way of enforcing such a request. I’ll 
just say I don’t trust him, myself.” 

“I still don’t see why not. He’s 
changed over to this high-pressure

tcheme, but so have I, and you’ve 
decided to trust me, I gather.” 

“Don’t remind me of it. It’s a 
point against you. Still, I’m hoping 
that with you it’s just a cover-up. 
After all you seem to believe it’s a 
reversible change, even if I don’t, 
judging by your expression when I 
said it wasn’t. I hope for your sake 
you’re right.” 

“Why shouldn’t Bert have believed 
the same and had the same motive?” 

“If that’s the case, why has he 
been down here a year? If he can 
come back, he must be up to some- 
thing, because he hasn’t. If he can’t 
he’s up to something because he 
must have told you it was possible. 
Think it over.” 

I did and found myself with no 
good answer. The best I could say 
was, “All right. I’ll be careful.” I had 
started to swim away when she called 
my name. Irritated, I turned back 
and saw her face pressed close to the 
port. As I looked she spoke again, 
much more softly, so that even im- 
mersed in the liquid I could barely 
hear. 

“You’re a pretty good egg. If it 
weren’t for Joe — ” 

She broke off, and her face dis- 
appeared from the port. 

I swam away, listening to my own 
heartbeat and trying to organize my 
thoughts. 

XIV 

T here was no sign of Bert in the 
corridor outside, and I didn’t 
dare wander in search of him. I did 
remember the way back to the near- 
the ocean entrance and swam there 



in the hope that it was a logical place 
for him to ibe waiting. 

There were at least a dozen peo- 
ple in the big chamber, and more 
could be seen dimly in the darker 
water above, but none of them was 
Bert. I could think of nothing to do 
but wait for him, as far as the main 
program was concerned. But it did 
seem a good time to pick up a little 
local education. 

I swam up to the interface and 
hesitated. Other people were going 
through from time to time. I decided 
I’d better watch their technique be- 
fore I tried it myself. 

It was simple enough. All one did 
was cling to a ladder, remove one’s 
ballast belt and hang it on one of the 
numerous hooks lining the rim and 
swim through. However, everyone 
who did this was wearing helmet and 
coveralls, presumably to keep the 
special liquid in their mouths, ears 
and so on. Maybe ocean water would 
hurt lungs, for all I knew. Anyway, 
no one stuck an unhelmeted head 
through the boundary, and I decided 
to play safe myself even though I 
couldn’t see what the danger, if any, 
might be. 

Several of the people around were 
watching me, I noticed. One or two 
of them had expressions of concern 
on their faces. One gestured at me, 
but of course I couldn’t read her 
signs. She watched me for a moment, 
saw that I didn’t answer, made an- 
other flickering series of hand mo- 
tions to those around her and then 
swam over to me. She pointed to the 
water and then to me and raised 
her eyebrows quizzically. The nature 
of her queiy was easy to guess. 



148 



IF 




though the girl herself commanded 
more attention than her signals. 

She might have been the one I had 
seen outside, though there was no 
way to be sure. There were several 
others in the group who were just 
as likely to be that one. She had 
straight blonde hair, cut short in a 
bob which could easily be accommo- 
dated in one of the swimming hel- 
mets. She was about five feet three 
in height and would have weighed 
about a hundred and ten pounds out 
of water. She was wearing a two- 
piece affair which was a long way 
from being a coverall, but protected 
much more acreage than a bikini. 
Her face was rather narrow, and I 
could make no guess at her regional 
origin. 

In response to her question, or 
what I assumed to be her question, 
I raised an arm toward the water 
surface very slowly, watching her 
with raised eyebrows as I did so. 

She gave a violent negative head- 
shake, wrapped her arms tight 
around herself and shuddered - real- 
istically. I could also interpret that 
and was annoyed with myself for 
not remembering that the water out- 
side would be cold. It was useful 
data; it justified the inference that 
the liquid we were in was not a very 
good heat conductor, or I’d already 
have felt the chill of the ocean wa- 
ter only a few yards away. Of course 
it couldn’t be too poor a conductor 
either, or we’d be having the standard 
spacesuit problem of getting rid of 
surplus body heat. I hadn’t been con- 
scious of either heat or cold up to 
this moment. Now I wished I had a 
thermometer so that I could form 



some numerically meaningful opin- 
ions. 

I held up one finger and poked it 
toward the boundary, asking the girl 
the same question with my eyebrows. 
She shrugged, as though to say it 
was my finger, so I pushed it on 
through. 

The temperature was bearable, but 
I could see why the swimmers wore 
coveralls. I thought I could stand it 
for a short time if I had to, but saw 
no reason to make a test of the mat- 
ter just then. 

I thought it would be more useful 
to start to get familiar with the nor- 
mal communication method of these 
people. In spite of Bert’s remarks and 
my earlier try through the tank walls, 
it seemed possible that some of them 
might know at least a little of some 
language I did. I showed the girl the 
writing pad. She nodded at the sight 
of it and flashed a sidelong smile at 
the others who were drifting in the 
vicinity. I wrote a short sentence in 
each of my more usuable languages 
and held the pad up for her to read. 

S he looked at it courteously and 
carefully, but smiled and shook 
her head. I showed it to the others, 
with much the same reaction. Then 
there was a lengthy session of flick- 
ering fingers as they held a conversa- 
tion among themselves. Several of 
them, including the girl, looked as 
though they would have laughed if 
it had been physically possible. Then 
the girl took the pad and stylus from 
me, and began to make marks of her 
own. 

The stylus moved very rapidly, but 
not in a set across-and-back lines

like ordinary writing. It was more 
like drawing, from where I floated. 
It took her perhaps thirty seconds to 
finish, then she handed the talblet 
back to me and let me gawk at it. 
I gawked. 

What she had done is impossible 
to describe in real detail, though a 
general idea can be given. In a way, 
it was rather like an electrical dia- 
gram, with straight lines going from 
one place to another, most of them 
parallel to the edges of the pad. 
Sometimes there were tiny gaps in 
the lines where one would have inter- 
sected another; sometimes (the junc- 
tions were marked with dots; some- 
times one line went through another 
with no effect on either. Here and 
there in the maze were tiny patterns, 
incredibly complex considering the 
time that had been spent on them. 
None of these looked exactly like an 
electrical symhol I knew, hut 'all left 
a vague feeling of familiarity. The 
whole pattern was almost a picture. 
It gave a tantalizing effect of being 
something I should recognize but 
couldn’t dig out of the back of my 
mind. I kept trying to interpret it in 
terms of a circuit diagram, which as 
I said it vaguely resembled, but got 
nowhere. I tried to think of it as one 
of those trick drawings all made out 
of straight lines which become mod- 
ern art every few decades, and got 
no farther. I had to shake my head 
as the girl had done. 

I cleared the s'heet and tried some 
more languages, this time ones I 
don’t know at all well. All I was 
hoping for was evidence of recogni- 
tion. I didn’t get it. Not a trace. This 
was very odd, since the dozen or so 



languages I had covered represent 
native (tongues for something like 
three quarters of the Earth’s popula- 
tion and included at least a few 
known slightly by educated people 
everywhere. 

The girl reciprocated my second 
effort with another of her own. I 
could see that it differed in detail 
from the first, but it (bore a strong 
family resemblance to its predecessor, 
and I couldn’t make any more sense 
out of it. If I’d had a camera able to 
work under the circumstances I’d 
have photographed it on the chance 
that it had something to do with the 
power plants, though even at my 
most optimistic I’d have admitted it 
was a very slim Chance. 

T he thought of plans in general 
gave me an idea, though. I 
cleared the pad again and drew in 
its center a small sketch meant to 
represent the room we were in, the 
various passages leading from it and 
the chamber where Marie’s sub was 
berthed. The girl didn’t get the idea 
at first, so I swam over to one of 
the passages whose entrance I had 
indicated, looked down it to see 
whether it were straight or not and 
extended the appropriate lines on the 
drawing. 

That seemed to get (across. She 
nodded her head after some more 
hand-talk with her friends; then she 
gave me a “so what” look. I handed 
her the pad and stylus and gestured 
around, hoping she’d see I wanted a 
map of the place. 

They understood this, too, I felt 
sure, but the hand-talk went on for 
a good deal longer. I hoped they 



150 



IF 




were merely arguing about the best 
way to give me the information, 
rather than whether to give me it at 
all. What I would have liked best was 
a regular chart of the place, not 
someone’s freehand sketches. 

The argument, if that’s what it 
was, was interrupted by Bert’s return. 
It was a relief to be able to converse 
understandably, however slowly, 
once more, but Bert had his own 
ideas about the subject of conversa- 
tion. He took the writing materials 
from the girl and cleared the pad 
without a glance at what was on it. 

“Did you get any cooperation out 
of Marie, or has she lumped you 
with the rest of the outcasts?” he 
asked. 

“I think I’m on probation,” I re- 
plied. “Nothing will really satisfy 
her but a definite report on Joe.” 
“Well, we can’t give one. To the 
best of my knowledge he never got 
here.” 

“You didn’t spot his sub in the vi- 
cinity, even?” 

“No one reported it.” 

“But how about your sonar?” 
“We don’t use it except under 
very special circumstances. It would 
be too likely to be picked up. We’re 
quite willing to have the world know 
about us, but only if they find out 
all about us. Don’t you have that 
picture yet? We simply don’t want to 
be lumped in with the power-wasters 
the Board is always after, and you 
know perfectly well that that’s the 
picture people will have if we don’t 
get a chance to explain.” 

“I suppose that’s true. It’s the pic- 
ture Marie has now, and she seems 
quite fond of it. I wonder if just ex- 



plaining is really going to be enough.” 

“It would be if people would be- 
lieve the explanation.” I said nothing 
about the profundity of that remark. 

“You’ve been explaining to Marie 
for six weeks, and she doesn’t.” 

“No, we haven’t. We’ve been talk- 
ing for six weeks and she doesn’t lis- 
ten. There’s a difference. She refuses 
to discuss anything except Joe. I 
think your greatest service, both to 
us and to the Board, would be to get 
her to pay attention to a genuine de- 
scription of the whole situation.” 

I digested that for half a minute 
or so. Several of the people who had 
been there when Bert arrived had 
now swum away, but the girl and 
two or three others were still watch- 
ing with interest. They were deeply 
absorbed in seeing what we were 
writing on the pad, crowding in to 
look at each message in turn over 
the writer’s or intended recipient’s 
shoulder. The girl always seemed to 
get the best place. Standards of cour- 
tesy seemed a bit old-fashioned com- 
pared with most regions at the sur- 
face. 

“You may be right,” I wrote at 
last, after trying to fit what he had 
said into the program I had outlined 
for myself. “That would seem to 
mean that I’ll have to see this whole 
installation with my own eyes, so as 
to be able to claim first-hand knowl- 
edge.” 

“Precisely. Come along. With this 
job, you may be spared farming 
after all, but at least you’ll have to 
see the farms. As a matter of fact. 
I’m getting hungry, and it must be 
even longer for you than for me 
since the last decent meal.”

I I had no objection to this thought, 
and followed him as he swam off 
through still another of the passages. 
^ The girl and three others, after a 
couple of gestures, followed us. 

As before, it just wasn’t practical 
to write and swim at the same time, 
so I had plenty of opportunity for 
thought as we traveled. I wasn’t able 
^ to use it very constructively, and 
|j there’s nothing much I can say about 
Hthe trip except that it took around 
S fifteen or twenty minutes. Absolute- 
^ly nothing of interest, and as far as 
\\1 know nothing of importance, hap- 
^ pened until we reached a doorway 
much less regular in shape than the 
circular and rectangular ones I had 
seen so far. 

The light on the other side was 

t fainter than in the tunnels, but 
brighter than in the ocean beyond 
the regular entrances. I followed 
Bert with quickened interest, guess- 
ing what I’d see. 



I wasn’t surprised to find myself 
suddenly a few yards above the 
sea bottom; I was “outdoors.” 

The passage we had just left was 
cut into a sloping rock face — as a 
matter of fact, the passage itself was 
a long way from horizontal, as I 
could now see. I had not been aware 
of swimming uphill during any of the 
trip. There was, I reflected, little 
reason why I should have been. 

A few yards below me a stretch of 
sea bottom extended into the dis- 
tance. Once out of the tunnel I could 
see that it was quite well lighted. 
Looking up, I could see perhaps fifty 



152 



IF 





feet above me the glowing surface 
of the “tent” roof. The bottom it-! 
self might as well have been under 
five feet of water instead of five 
thousand. It was covered with vege- 
tation. ! 

I didn’t recognize any of the plant 
life, but that was natural. I might 
have learned some descriptive biol- 
ogy, or natural history, or whatever 
it should be called if Fd been born 
before genetic manipulation becajme 
a practical art, but I wasn’t and 
didn’t Presumably this plant life had 
been tailored to provide food for the 
local population, and the light was 
there to permit the plants to grow. 

“It was alcnost as good an excuse 
for the wasted kilowatts as the one 
Bert had given me. Just once, several 
years before, I had tasted natural 
food confiscated from a waster, and 
I had sympathizied with the fellow 
even then. I’d had to rehearse the 
moral precepts very firmly, several 
times a day, for weeks afterward. I’d 
finally recovered my normally 
healthy resentment of people who 
corner resources to give themselves 
pleasures denied to the rest of us, 
but it had come hard. 

Bert and the others were slanting 
down toward the bottom, which was 
laid out in roughly rectangular 
patches with a different variety of 
plant in each. Other swimmers were 
around in fairly large numbers. Some 
appeared to be eating, others work- 
ing. The precise nature of the labor 
was obscure, partly 'because of their 
distance and partly because I knew 
no more of farming than anyone else 
had for the last century or so. 

My companions were now pulling

round, greenish excrescenses from 
the plants and taking bites from 
them. The girl handed one to me, 
and watched with evident amusement 
while I looked it over and finally 
took an experimental nibble. 

I couldn’t quite make up my mind 
whether I likM it or not. It was very 
different from any ordinary tank 
alga and was not in a class with 
that forbidden taste of years before, 
but it was interesting. I tried another 
bite, decided it was good and fin- 
ished it off. The girl showed me how 
to get others from the plant without 
a major struggle — they had to be 
twisted in a special way before the 
tough stems would yield — and then 
left me to my own devices while she 
ate several of the things herself. 

Then she beckoned me to follow, 
led the way to another patch, and 
showed me a different fruit. I made 
a very satisfact(My meal in the next 
quarter of an hour. 

1 wondered which, if any, of these 
growths was the oxygen source. 
Perhaps they aU were; they were all 
green and presumably photosynthe- 
tic, but none were giving off visible 
bubbles as food-alga tanks are always 
doing. I decided not to worry about 
oxygen; there was no reason for 
Bert’s friends to kill me off in such 
an indirect and inconvenient way as 
by depriving me of that. They’d al- 
ready had too many chances. 

It suddenly dawned on me that I 
was lumping Bert in more and more 
closely with the local dwellers, in 
my own mind. I don’t believe most 
of what I read about the subcon- 
scious it seems to me to be too 



much like astrology, alcohol and 
other excuses for sloppy thinking 
and incompetence — but as I re- 
viewed consciously the events of the 
last few hours it looked more and 
more as though my changing atti- 
tudes were justified. He seemed to 
regard himself more as a local citi- 
zen than as a Board worker with a 
job to do, and maybe I’d been pick- 
ing up his attitude without really 
noticing the evidence. 

There was his choice of words, for 
example. I’d^been devoting more at- 
tention to what he said than to the 
exact way he said it, but now that 
I thought of it there were a lot of 
“We’s” and “Us’s” which didn’t 
really belong in the thoughts of a 
good Board official under the cir- 
cumstances — especially if he were 
really sure that no one but I could 
read what he was writing. 

Maybe Marie wasn’t being so un- 
reasonable after all. 

I glanced over at him. He was 
eating, like the others, but he seemed 
to be taking very little part in the 
conversation which the unoccupied 
hands of the eaters were carrying on. 

I don’t really blame myself for 
not seeing anything very significant 
in that at the time. If anything, it 
reassured me; it was consistent with 
his claim that he hadn’t learned much 
of the local talk. 

But after the meal I began to feel 
bothered again. He took me every- 
where I showed the slightest desire 
to go. He explained, convincingly, 
everything I asked about. There was 
the tent roof, for example. When I 
wrote a question about that, his face 
turned an odd purple color; when 



154 



IF 




tiiat had faded, he wrote, “Careful. 
With liquid in your lungs, laughing 
can kill you. They cut a key nerve 
in your coughing reflex when they 
changed you, hut you can still laugh 
if you’re not careful.” 

“What’s funny about that ques- 
tion?” 

“Well, I can see where you’d get 
the idea of a fabric over this place, 
but I assure you no one has gone 
to any such trouble. What you see 
is simply the interface between the 
liquids.” 

“Why doesn’t it look the saifie 
here — translucent instead of trans- 
parent — as it does at the entrances? 
Why do you have special entrances, 
for that matter?” 

“We keep the entrances cleared 
off. There’s too much area for that 
— several square miles — over the 
farms. Stuff in the ocean is settling 
to the bottom all the time, and stuff 
formed on the farms is floating up- 
ward. Some of each — a very small 
percentage, luckily — has density be- 
tween that of our liquid and water, 
so it collects at the interface. As a 
matter of fact, a good deal of living 
matter grows there, though fortun- 
ately it’s monocellular stuff. If there 
were more of it, we’d have to clear 
anyway to let light through to the 
plants, which would be quite a pro- 
ject.” 

I should have asked him right then, 
I know, why the lights were up in 
the water instead of down closer to 
the plants. It was just one of those 
things that I didn’t. If he’d answered, 
it would have saved me a good deal 
of later embarrassment, though I’m 



still not sure that he would have. I 
suppose he would, on the basis of 
what I understand now of his rea- 
sons for acting as he did. 

When I mentioned the power 
plant, he started off immediately, 
with the same group trailing along. 
I wondered whether they were 
guards, secret agents or curious 
idlers, but didn’t waste much time on 
the question. There was no way to 
tell, or even to make a decent guess. 
In any case, with the power plant 
next on the agenda, no other ques- 
tion was very interesting. 

After a time we reached the first 
large closed door I had seen since 
emerging from my tank. It was much 
like the one which had admitted my 
container to the conversion room. 
Bert made a few gestures to our es- 
cort; they began a longer conver- 
sation among themselves, but he 
didn’t wait for them to finish. He be- 
gan opening small lockers in the tun- 
nel wall, and extracting coveralls 
which looked like the ones used out- 
side in the ocean. They were com- 
plete with helmets. 

“What’s the reason for these? 
Temperature?” I wrote when he ges- 
tured me to put one on. 

“No. You probably haven’t found 
out yet, and I hope for your sake 
you don’t, but immersed as we are 
in liquid we’re very sensitive to in- 
tense sound waves.” I didn’t inter- 
rupt with my experience, but for 
once I was sure he was telling un- 
varnished truth.- “The power plant 
is very efficient, but there’s still a 
trace of noise — quite enough to kill 
an unprotected person. Get the suit 
on and make sure it’s tight.”

I obeyed. I had a little trouble; the 
garment wasn’t as simple as it looked. 
One of the buckles proved to have 
a sharp corner which cut quite a deep 
gash on my hand and I wondered 
what sort of quality control would 
put up with that sort of design. The 
drops of blood looked a little strange, 
bright-red globules rising from the 
wound, but the injury was minor. 
By the time Bert had solved my 
problem with the buckle the bleeding 
had stopped. 

He checked my coverall, especially 
the wrist and helmet junctions, very 
carefully. The others had also dress- 
ed and were doing the same for each 
other. Gestures which even I could 
interpret signified that the checks 
were complete, and Bert turned to 
the door. 

He manipulated a dial at its side, 
and the great valve — large enough 
to accommodate a small work sub 
— swung easily open. He waved us 
through, waited until we had passed 
and closed the portal behind us. It 
struck me again that his air was not 
merely one of familiarity but of 
authority. How, in a single year, 
could a Board agent have made him- 
self so completely trusted by these 
people? A Board agent, of all people 
on Earth the most likely to take ac- 
tion against them and their way of 
life? Could he have been in contact 
with them even before his disappear- 
ance from the surface a year ago? 
Could Marie be right? And if she 
were, what was I getting into? I had 
trusted Bert Whelstrahl completely 
when I first saw him down here 
and had tossed off most of Marie’s 
claims as coming from a woman 

156 



nearly hysterical with grief; it had 
seemed likely enough that her Joe 
— not that he’d ever been hers, in 
his own estimation — had actually 
never reached this place. Eaough 
other things could happen to make 
a one-man sub disappear in the Pa- 
cific. 

Now I was wondering, deeply. 
But there were other matters claim- 
ing attention. 

XVI 

F or the first time, I found myself 
in a tunnel which was obviously 
slanted steeply — the pull of my 
ballast belt let me judge “up” and 
“down” easily enough when I paid 
attention to the matter. We were 
heading downward at fully sixty de- 
grees. The tunnel lights, the only 
distinct features on the walls, were 
going by at a speed which showed 
we were being helped by pumps; 
there was certainly a downward cur- 
rent. I wondered if we’d have to 
swim against it on the way back and 
decided it wouldn’t be possible. 
Either they’d reverse the flow, or 
we’d use another tunnel. 

I didn’t notice any temperature 
change, though I knew we were go- 
ing to examine a heat engine. Maybe 
this bunch was moral enough about 
energy waste when it came to the 
sort of leakage which robbed a ma- 
chine of efficiency, no matter how 
they behaved about it afterward. 

I couldn’t guess how far down we 
went before reaching the control 
chamber. It was certainly hundreds 
of feet, probably thousands, possibly 
as much as a mile. I did see the 



IF 




charts of the layout later on, but the 
peculiar ideas of scale used by their 
makers still defeats me. It was cer- 
tainly far enough down to present 
a hopeless obstacle to any brute- 
force defense against pressure as 
armor. 

The room itself was big enough 
to make the far end hard to see. 
The liquid, as I guess I may have 
forgotten to mention scattered light 
just a trifle and gave objects more 
than fifty yards or so away a foggy 
appearance. 

The room, though, as a control 
chamber was almost shockingly con- 
ventional. It contained along one wall 
a pattern of lines which even I 
could recognize as a distribution net. 
Below this was another pattern, 
harder to recognize but of noticeably 
vertical orientation, and I suspected 
that it indicated the working-fluid 
circuits between the heat source far 
below and the converters and heat 
sink at the top. A heat engine of any 
sort works on pretty basic thermo- 
dynamics, and its diagrams are apt 
to resemble those of its relatives 
whether it’s a steam turbine or a 
thermocouple. 

Along the lines of both diagrams 
were indicators, mostly of familiar 
dial-and -needle type, switches and 
rheostats. Nothing was mystifying; 
it was a power plant control at a 
glance. That is, it could be recog- 
nized at a glance. It couild be learned, 
given luck and competence, in a 
month or two. 

Thirty or forty swimmers, suited 
and helmeted like ourselves, drifted 
a few feet from the control wall, all 
their attention focused on it. This 



was a little surprising. I would have 
expected fewer operators on a board 
of this size. If they were all neces- 
sary for manual control, it was an- 
other mark against the general level 
of technical competence here, like 
the sharp buckle. I hoped that poor 
coordination on their part would 
merely result in nuisance rather than 
catastrophe. No doubt there were 
fail-safe breakers in the electric dis- 
tribution net and some sort of emer- 
gency bleed-offs here and there in 
the fluid lines, but even so that crowd 
of operators gave a certain primitive 
air to the whole thing. I watched 
thoughtfully. The ones who had 
come in with us looked with as much 
interest as I felt; I got the impres- 
sion that they hadn’t been here be- 
fore either. Well, that was quite pos- 
sible. The whole population could 
hardly be composed of power en- 
gineers. 

It added to the mystery, though, 
because I knew that ]^rt wasn’t one 
eithef. He had a general engineering 
background like my own, which of 
course you need to be any good at 
tracking down power waste. Why 
should he have authority around 
here? 

H e turned and made a couple of 
gestures at our escort. Then he 
wrote me a message. 

“Don’t get close enough to distract 
any of these people. More than half 
of them are trainees.” That put a 
slightly better light on the situation. 

“You take your education here 
seriously,” I answered. 

“You bet we do. You’ll see why, 
soon. Swim around as much as you

157 




want and look at what you want — 
you know enough so I don’t have to 
watch you like these others. Just 
don’t get in front of an operator.” 

I nodded. For the next half hour 
I did just as he had written, examin- 
ing the entire board in as much de- 
tail as I could. The arrangement 
made more and more sense as time 
went on. One very surprising reason 
for this was that the dials and con- 
trol knobs were marked in perfectly 
ordinary numbers. I hadn’t expected 
that, after seeing what seemed to 
pass for writing down here. 

The numbers were alone, unfor- 
tunately — no units such as volts or 
megabars were given. In spite of this, 
the position of each instrument on 
the diagram which formed the board 
usually gave a pretty good clue to 
its purpose. In less than an hour I 
felt I understood the system pretty 
well. 

Ten shafts led down to the heat 
absorbers at the source — presum- 
ably a magma pocket. The details of 
the absorbers themselves weren’t ob- 
vious from the board, but I knew 
enough about volcanic installations to 
guess. I’d done a waste investigation 
in Java once. The working fluid was 
water; the still which took in sea 
water and desalted it, the electrolysis 
units which got alkali metals from 
the recovered salts and the ion in- 
jection feeds were all obvious on the 
board. 

The MHD converters were also 
ten in number, but all exhausted into 
a common condenser which appeared 
to be cooled by outside sea water. 
It did not serve as a preheater for 
the still, . which seemed wasteful to 



me. Without units on the gauges I 
couldn’t be sure of the net power 
developed, but it seemed obvious that 
it had to be in megawatts at least. 

I hadn’t noticed the sound of 
which Bert had warned, but perhaps 
that was because of the suit. I took 
a chance and loosened slightly one 
of the cuffs between sleeve and 
glove. There was sound, a heavy 
drone like a vast organ pipe and no 
doubt due to the same physical 
cause. It wasn’t painful, but I could 
tell that removing the protecting suit 
entirely might be unwise. I wondered 
how close we actually were to the 
steam tunnels which must be the 
source of the hum. Even more, I 
wondered about their maintenance, 
but I had to do without details for 
the time being. 

The people who had come with 
Bert and me had stayed farther from 
the board, presumably because of 
his orders. They watched for a while 
what was going on, but gradually 
began talking to each other, judging 
by their hand motions. They rather 
reminded me of school children who 
have lost interest in watching the 
film. Once again I was reminded of 
the oddness in Bert’s being able to 
give orders, or even act as a guide. 

He himself, after the first few 
minutes, paid no attention to the peo- 
ple who had come with us. He had 
waved to me in a gesture which I 
had interpreted as meaning that he’d 
be back later and swam out of sight. 
I assumed he would be and kept on 
with my inspection of the board. 

F or a good deal of the rest of the 
hour, the girl and her compan- 



158 



IF 




ions followed me araund, though 
without getting as close to board 
and operators as I did. They seemed 
to be more interested in me than in 
the engineering. I considered this 
understandable in the case of the 
girl and supposed the men were just 
staying with her. 

I finally decided that I had made 
all I could of the board and began 
to wonder where Bert had gone. 
There seemed no way to ask; he had 
taken the writing pad with him, and 
anyway the futility of that method 
had been established. If there had 
been among my satellites someone 
not present at the earlier experi- 
ment, I might have been tempted 
to try again anyway, but as it was 
the absence of writing gear was more 
of a challenge than a nuisance. This 
seemed to be a good time to start 
learning the local gesture language. 

I swam away from the control 
panel to the farther wall, the others 
following, and began what I hoped 
would be a language lesson by the 
method standard in fiction. I point- 
ed to things, and tried to get the 
others to use their gesture-words for 
them. 

To say that it went badly is un- 
derstating. It went so badly that I 
wasn’t even sure whether they had 
grasped what I wanted by the time 
Bert came back. They had made lots 
of hand, arm and finger motions, 
both at me and at each other, but I 
saw no way of telling whether any 
of them were the names of things 
I pointed at, or symbols for the verbs 
I acted out. Probably I was missing 
a lot of the subtle motions and at- 
titudes anyway, but I simply never 



detected a pattern repeated often 
enough to be learned. It was as 
frustrating an experience as I’d had 
since — well, for a few hours, any- 
way. Maybe a day or more. 

W hen Bert did get back and saw 
what was going on he had an- 
other siege of near-laughter. 

“I tried that, too,” he finally 
wrote, “when I first got here. I’m 
supposed to be a fair linguist, but 
I never made more than the slightest 
headway I hate to seem conceited, 
but I really don’t think it can be 
done unless you start as a child.” 
“You must have learned a little.” 
“Yes, About fifty basic symbols 
— I think.” 

“But you were talking to these 
people here. I got the impression 
you were telling them what to do.” 
“I was, in a sloppy sort of way. 
My few dozen gestures include the 
most obvious verbs, but even those 
I can’t do very well. Three quarters 
of the people can’t understand me 
at all — this girl here is one of the 
best. I can read them only when 
they make my few signs very slow- 
ly.” 

“Then how in blazes are you in 
a position to tell any of them what 
to do? And how does that fact jibe 
with what you told me about no 
one here being able to tell people 
what to do?” 

“I may have expressed myself 
badly. This isn’t a very authoritative 
government, but the Council’s ad- 
vice is usually taken, at least on mat- 
ters even slightly connected with 
'physical maintenance of the installa- 
tion.” 



OCEAN ON TOP 



159 




“And this council has given you 
some sort of authority? Why? And 
does that mean that Marje was right 
in believing you’d deserted the Board 
and mankind and gone over to these 
wasters for good?” 

“One question at a time, please,” 
he scribbled hastily. “The Council 
didn’t exactly give me authority. I’m 
making my suggestions as a mem- 
ber.” 

“I took the pad and cleared it, 
trying to catch his eye the whole 
time. I finally wrote, “Let’s have 
that again? My eyes must be fooling 
me, too.” 

He grinned and repeated the sen- 
tence. I looked at him with an ex- 
pression which sobered him at once, 
and he went on writing. 

“I’m not — ” heavily underlined — 
“here to stay, whatever Marie may 
think, and in spite of what I told 
you before. I’m sorry about having 
to lie to you. I’m here to do a job; 
what will happen after it’s done I 
don’t know. You’re in the same posi- 
tion, as you know perfectly well.” I 
had to nod agreement at that point. 
“I’m on the Council because of my 
linguistic skills and general back- 
ground.” I was so hard put to it to 
make sense out of that remark that 
I almost failed to read the next one 
in time; I had to stop him as I was 
about to clear the board to make 



room for more words. “There’s a 
little more information about the 
place down here which I wasn’t go- 
ing to bother you with, but I’ve 
changed my mind. I’ll let you see it, 
and you can decide for yourself how 
and whether to include it or allow 
for it in your job of getting Marie 
to make her mind up. I have my 
opinion on how' it should be used, 
but you’re entitled to yours. Come 
on. I want you to meet the engineer 
in charge of maintenance develop- 
ment work here.” 

He swam off, and I went after 
him with the others trailing behind. 
I had no urge to talk, even if it had 
been possible. 1 was still trying to 
figure out how someone whose mas- 
tery of the local speech represented 
a slow two-year-old’s vocabulary 
could have earned an official posi- 
tion on the strength of his linguistic 
talents. 

No doubt you’ve seen it by now, 
since I’ve tried to tell this fairly, 
but it was too much for me. I was 
so far behind the facts that I was 
even startled by something else you’ve 
probably been expecting. We swam 
into a sort of office opening from 
the far end of the control room, and 
I saw floating in front of a micro- 
film viewer, oblivious to the people 
around him, my good friend Joey 
Elfven.

H U E 
AND 
CRY 



Dear Editor: 

I was very interested in the let- 
ter you printed in the May issue of 
If from Patrick Kelly of Baltimore, 
in which he asked if anyone was 
making plans against the day when 
the establishment of colonies inde- 
pendent of existinig governments 
would be possible ( such as com- 
munities on the ocean floor or on 
the moon). I think I have what he 
(and probably many other readers 
as well) is looking for, and more. 

I had had thoughts similar to 
those of Mr. Kelly for some time. 
Then a couple of years ago, I start- 
ed reading newspaper articles about 
the “pirate^^ radio stations operat- 
ing on ships anchored in internation- 
al waters off the coast of various 
European countries, and it occured 
to me that this was a means of 
establishing a more-or-less indepen- 
dent community right here, right 
now, without waiting for future 
technology. During the past two 
years, I and some of my colleagues 
here at MIT have been doing a 
considerable amount of speculation 
about and research into the techni- 
cal, political, economic and social 
problems and possibilities of the 
idea. 

Technically, the ship concept has 
the enormous advantage of involv- 
ing no new techniques, and thus of 



being immediately feasible. Long- 
term expansion of the community, 
however, will require a larger source 
of floating “real estate.^^ The most 
promising approach appears to be 
one found feasible during World 
War II by the Navy, but abandoned 
as not suited to their particular 
needs at the time : anchoring ice 
floes that have been covered with 
insulation, and keeping them solid 
with refrigerating units. Our stu- 
dies indicate that these floes (which 
are plentiful in sizes up to many 
miles across and tens of meters 
thick) can be refrigerated with a 
surprisingly modest installation, 
even when their insulation is quite 
thin. 

Politically, the most appealing 
idea is, of course, the establishment 
of independent countries. However, 
these countries would have little 
recourse if they were attacked by 
a private group seeking their down- 
fall, or were seized by a neighboring 
mainland country that became ir- 
ritated by their presence (both of 
which have caused the demise of 
“pirate’’ radio stations). On the 
other hand, registration of the com- 
munities as regular vessels under 
the flag of an appropriate country 
(Monaco and Luxembourg seem 
best suited for this), while provid- 
ing a measure of protection from the 



161 




fates described above, would in- 
volve accepting certain restrictions, 
which might or might not prove 
fatal to a community, depending on 
whate the residents were planning 
to undertake. 

Whichever of these approaches 
is chosen, it is clear that taxation 
(even allowing for the cost of pro- 
viding services that would ordinarily 
be tax-supported) will be consider- 
ably less than on the mainland. This 
economic advantage may well be 
the most important factor in expand- 
ing interest in the idea from a 
small group of enthusiasts to a 
broad cross-section of the popula- 
tion. 

Socially, the concept is virtually 
a blank check for any group of 
Utopians to put their ideas into 
practice through the creation of 
everything from a Fourth Reich led 
by George Lincoln Rockwell to a 
Classless Society manned by Marx- 
ist purists. The survival of these ex- 
periments will probably be no higher 
than ever, but some worthwhile 
ideas may emerge, and, in any case, 
the participants will enjoy their 
lives the more for their attempts, 
successful or not. 

In short, the offshore commun- 
ity offers as much freedom to de- 
part from accepted norms in poli- 
tics, economics and social structure 
as did the discovery of the New 
World (and all without Indians, 
even ! ) . 

When Mr. Kelly^s letter appeared, 
we here at MIT had just decided 
that it was time to follow the ex- 
ample set by Mr. Ettinger and his 
bodyfreezing proposal and seek 
wide publicity with a view towards 
getting one or more groups together 
to put the idea into practice. We 
were wondering if you mght be in- 
terested in running a more detailed 



summary of the work that has been 
done on the proposal (of which the 
above is, naturally, only the barest 
outline) in the magazine. If so, IM 
appreciate hearing from you. 

I meant to bring this up when 
you were up here for Boskone, but I 
was too busy with arrangements. 
Thanks again for coming, and I 
hope you enjoyed it as much as we 
did. — Erwin S. ^‘Filthy Pierre”

setts 02142.

Dear Editor: 

IPs prediction time again 
(again?) ! I predict a Hugo for 
Keith Laumer. His novel. Spaceman, 
was one of the best (in my opinion) 
to come along in a long time. 

My favorite novelette published in 
IF this year i:: Roger Zelazny’s This 
Mortal Mountain. I also enjoy Larry 
Niven’s stories. My favorite written 
by him this year is Flatlander. 

Gray Morrow’s cover painting for 
the August issue was absolutely 
beautiful! I also enjoyed Wally 
Wood’s artwork on The Winged Hel- 
met. I hope to see more of his art- 
work in future issues of IF. 

One of the very good features of 
your magazine is the *‘first” stories 
you print. Maybe one of these days 
I’ll send in a story. — Thomas Mil- 
ler, 483 Wilton Drive, Baton Rouge,

Galaxy's all-star lineup of contributors weave 
stories that are sometimes wry, sometimes ter- 
rifying — but always a delight to read. 

Would you like to join us, next issue and 
every issue thereafter for years to come, on 
this fascinating exploration of the fears and 
foibles of tomorrow? All it takes is a check, a 
stamp and a minute of your time. (If you pre- 
fer not to tear the coupon out of your maga- 
zine, just give us the information requested on 
a plain piece of paper.) From then on the mails 
will bring Galaxy to your door, with the best 
stories being written by the best science-fiction 
writers of all time. 

Here are some of the famous stories that 
appeared in Galaxy in its first fifteen years. 
Will the next fifteen years be as good? 

Frankly, we don't think so. We think they'll 
be better!
