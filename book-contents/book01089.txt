FOOTNOTES UP FRONT 



J ULES VERNE, Txdio got a 
going-over at the hands 
of Theodore L. Thomas in 
these pages a few months ago, 
is not without friends. If you 
doubt it, you should see our 
mail. 

Thomas's article was a 
thoughtful second look at 
Twenty Thousand Leagues Un- 
der the Sea from the vantage 
point of what we have since 
its writing learned about un- 
derwater facts of life. The 
article was entitled The Wa- 
tery Wonders of Captain 
Nemo, and it pointed out that 
many of the "astonishingly 
detailed predictions" Verne 
made in this first of subma- 
rine stories — just ain't so. 
For instance, there's the 
hoary old fabrication about 
how the first man who actually 
built a submarine periscope 
was refused a patent because 
Verne had already "invented" 



the device in his novel. This 
is a most appetizing fable for 
science -fiction readers like 
ourselves to enjoy; your editor 
has heard it broadcast at least 
twice in speeches at science- 
fiction conventions. But it's 
not true, sad to say. Verne 
not only didn't describe the 
periscope "accurately" — his 
Nautilus didn't have any per- 
iscope at all'. 

This struck us as so aston- 
ishing that we went down to 
the library and reread the old 
classic to see with our own 
eyes. True enough. The clos- 
est Verne came to it was a 
"glazed enclosure" — evident- 
ly a sort of retractable pilot- 
house — which is a horse of a 
quite different breed. 

Still, nobody can deny that 
Verne's crystal ball gave a 
very good picture on at least 
some of its channels. As Sam- 
uel A. Peeples (himself a 



writer of considerable attain- 
ments — as those who watch 
the credits of their favorite 
television shows know well) 
writes us, in Verne's novel 
"there is depicted the practi- 
cal use of the following items 
(none of which existed as a 
functioning practicality at the 
time the story was written):" 

1. An operating subma- 
rine. 

2. Electric lights with 
controlled degrees of 
light. 

3. Electric diving motors. 

4. Electric hoists. 

5. Electric elevators (the 
conning tower rose and 
lowered.) 

6. Double-hulled steel 
vessel for strength and 
safety against damage. 

7. The manufacture of 
food and other articles 
from seaweed, etc. 

8. Luminescent lighting 
(panels in ceiling.) 

9. Artificial manufacture 
of air (which Captain 
Nemo felt unneces- 
sary.) 

10. Electric centrifugal 
pumps. 

11. Electric clocks (un- 
known in 1866 ) even to 



a full description of 
their accuracy. 

12. Underwater speedom- 
eter. 

13. Electric stove for 
cooking. 

14. Electric water heater. 

15. Streamlined ship hull 
to reduce friction. 

16. Electric floodlights. 

17. Neon lights (electricity 
through glass tubes 
filled with gas for even 
white light.) 

18. Pneumatic underwater 
rifle. 

19. Auto-loading rifle. 

20. Airlock, complete to 
electrical piunps. 

21. Electric fence — to 
shock trespassers. 

We're grateful to Sam 
Peeples for the list — even if, 
maybe, one or two of the items 
aren't entirely beyond argu- 
ment. (The Japanese partic- 
ularly were gettingNemo-like 
food from the sea long before 
1866. An "operating subma- 
rine" existed as early as the 
War of the American Revolu- 
tion, and again in the Civil 
War.) 

But we still say that per- 
iscope just isn't there'. 



W E appreciate hearing 
from all of you, you 
know. Galaxy doesn't run a 
letter column, but that doesn't 
mean that your letters aren't 
read — and much appreciated. 
They furnish the only day-by- 
day guide we have to help us 
make the magazine what you 
like best. If it's humanlypos- 
sible, we'll usually try to do 
what you want . that's what 
we're in business for'. 

We have at least one read- 
er who we don't seem to have 
convinced of that. A young 
lady from the state of Wash- 
ington writes that she wants us 
to publish a letter column; 
what's more, she writes, "I 
am beginning to get angry; 
either publish the letter col- 
umn (which is what we want) 
or kindly admit that it is your 
magazine and you don't give a 
hollow hoot what your readers 
want . There is a compara- 
tively recent word in the Eng- 
lish language that fits this 
situation: Boycott. This is a 
group action, but just in case 
you didn't ^ow there is a 
group that just might be pre- 
pared to take this action . 
However ... it's doubtful if 
enough readers could be per- 



suaded to boycott to do any 
good; Galaxy is too good a 
magazine, and I'm afraid that 
backsliding would be rife." 

Dear reader, we appreciate 
the compliments and weigh 
your request. If there is any 
such large group of readers 
who want a letter column, we'd 
be pleased to hear from them. 
But you have to excuse us for 
doubting they exist. 

You point out that other 
science-fiction magazines 
have letter columns, which is 
true enough; but it hasn't ever 
been Galaxy's policy to be just 
like all other science-fiction 
magazines . Galaxy' s policy is 
very simple. We try to put out 
the best science-fiction maga- 
zine we possibly can. 

Does that mean we should 
print letters in every issue? 
Our best guess at this moment 
is no. In a postscript to your 
letter you add: "Bet most of 
your letters are on this sub- 
ject. Embarrassing, what?" 
We're afraid you lose that 
bet; of all the letters Galaxy 
received on the last three or 
four issues, at least, there 
was exactly one letter asking 
for a letter column. Yours.

PLANET 



Y oung man wanted, to 
travel sixty light-years and 
judge the life or death of a 
dozen worlds. Must have one 
hundred years experience in the 
quarantine service, and psionic 
classification five or better. Pay 
— well, an enterprising deputy 
warden with planets to sell could 
set his own price. 

The memo from the district 
office was not quite so bald, but 
those were the terms in which 
Wain Scarlet summed up the sit- 
uation for his own benefit. He had 
spent a tedious century at the 
regional headquarters on Dene- 
bola IV, waiting for just such an 
opening. He jumped at it. 



The jump wasn’t easy. 

His own face was the first great 
barrier. He was a scrawny, red- 
freckled runt, in a world where 
such needless ugliness was shock- 
ing. His half-conditioned parents 
had refused to meddle with na- 
ture. Then, before he himself was 
old enough to arrange his own 
aesthetic surgery, he had come to 
enjoy a cruel satisfaction in the 
pain he could inflict upon the 
beautiful beings around him, with, 
"the bulge of his low forehead and 
the jut of his rodent teeth and the 
defiant stare of his yellow eyes. 

The other barriers he had 
built upon that one, within his 
own mind. A habit of suspicion.

GALAXY 



By JACK WILLIAMSON Illustrated by FINLAY 

ft seemed that half the Galaxy was 
interested in Earth. The criminals 
sought to loot it; the better eiass 
merely wanted it destroyed by tire! 



A pattern of unprovoked aggres- 
sion and unnecessary flight. Al- 
though he had used the time- 
contracting neutrionic ships of the 
service to put a dozen different 
worlds behind him forever, he had 
not escaped his gnawing need to 
strike and run again. 

This time he was going to strike 
harder, and run farther. 

His goal was the galactic fron- 
tier, the fast-expanding bubble of 
new planetary systems claimed 
and conquered. Out there, a thou- 
sand Or ten thousand light-years 
beyond the utmost outposts of 
the service, all men were human. 
Perhaps, with the price of planets 
to spend, he could buy one last 
escape from eveiything he feared. 

If his plans seemed somewhat 
large for a common clerk in re- 
gional personnel, they had been 
growing for a hundred years, 
while he patiently endured all the 
incessant psionic indoctrination in 
the glorious traditions and the 
lofty obligations of the service, 
and carefully concealed his rank- 
ling resentment of all the hand- 
some men around him. 

When chance struck, he was 
ready. 

instrument of luck was 
Warden Thomwall, an inno- 
cent dark youth whom he secretly 
despised for his dark beauty and 
his frank friendship and his well- 
conditioned intelligence. 



“Wain, here’s a case that ought 
to interest you.” The warden 
tossed a little packet of docu- 
ments into the action basket on 
his desk. “A savage planet out the 
far side of nowhere, about to 
.reach a contact crisis. The natives 
are playing with rockets and 
atomic theory. Our watchers re- 
port that they will soon discover 
us. That means the end of our 
rights and duties imder the Cov- 
enants of Non-Contact. If the na- 
tives really qualify, we’ll have to 
usher them into civilization.” 

“I won’t hold my breath till 
they do.” Scarlet made a painful 
effort to reflect Thomwall’s open 
smile. “I’ve seen contact crises be- 
fore. The new races usually need 
several generations of supervised 
psionic training before we can cer- 
tify human status.” 

“Sol III will be no exception.” 
The lovely youngster nodded, un- 
aware of Scarlet’s veiled aversion. 
“You’ll find all the old arguments 
for extending the quarantine and 
for lifting it today — advanced by 
fussy old zoo-keepers and by pi- 
rates who want an open planet to 
loot and by social workers who 
need a new world to save. But 
this case gives us a novel compli- 
cation.” 

Scarlet looked hastily down at 
the documents, trying to hide the 
flicker of illicit hope in his tawny 
eyes. Cunning enough to know his 
own mental handicaps, he did his 



10 



GALAXY 



best to hide them from the rest 
of the world. 

“You’ll see a notice from the 
signal service,” the warden ex- 
plained. “They wanj to use Sol for 
the first unit of their new intergal- 
actic blinker. They’re asking us to 
evacuate all human beings from 
its vicinity, before they begin 
transmission.” 

“Must they use Sol?” Scarlet 
peered up at Thomwall, privately 
wondering how the demolition of 
a solar system might be turned 
into personal profit. “Aren’t there 
desert suns enough?” 

“Sol is a desert sun.” The beau- 
tiful man smiled serenely. “Even 
after five thousand years under 
our sujjervision, the native anthro- 
poids have failed to qualify for 
galactic citizenship. Their pro- 
gress reports arouse doubts that 
they ever will.” 

“Yet they’re alive.” 

“Any star you point at has half 
a dozen planets with life of some 
sort. The signal people have made 
a scientific survey of the stars 
available for their initial project. 
They need eight thousand stars 
of the right spectral type, located 
here at the Center. Sol is first on 
their list.” 

“There will be protests.” Scarlet 
squinted shrewdly. “Even from 
old hands in the service.” 

“I knew the case would interest 
you.” Thomwall glowed with ex- 
ecutive assurance. “Why don’t 



you look over the memo? I’ll have 
to check with the record section, 
but I believe you’re in line for 
the assignment if you want it.” 

SCARLET miu-mured a few po- 

lite words of praise for his 
rivals in the office, but he knew 
what the records section would 
say. Once, sixty years before, an- 
other beautiful and innocent 
young warden had gone stm-div- 
ing, tmsting Scarlet with the 
records. Since then the records 
said what Scarlet wanted them to. 

He fumbled quickly through 
the documents, trying to cover the 
sudden flare of triumph in his yel- 
low eyes. 

“You’ll have three possible de- 
cisions,” Thomwall went on. “You 
may decide that the inhabited 
planet needs a few more centuries 
to mature its native culture, under 
our care. If so, you may act within 
the limits of the Covenants to de- 
lay the contact and extend the 
quarantine.” 

Scarlet nodded, without much 
interest. Such a decision might 
please the cautious old heads in 
the service, but it offered no profit 
to him. 

“On the other hand, you may 
find that the natives are ready for 
admission ito civilization,” the 
warden said. “In that case, you 
may open the planet to traffic 
with the stars imder any supervi- 
sion you see fit to impose.” 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



11 



Scarlet brightened, scenting 
money. Every contact crisis 
brought outsiders swarming from 
all the worlds around, drawn by a 
himdred motives to welcome the 
new race into the dangerous free- 
doms of galactic civilization. Sure- 
ly somebody would pay what he 
wanted! 

“Or, finally, you may decide 
that the anthropoids will never 
qualify,” Thorhwall finished. “If 
so, you may overrule the protests 
against the blinker project and 
order the evacuation of every 
galactic citizen within a light-year 
of Sol.” 

Scarlet frowned, considering 
that. The signal service was un- 
likely to offer bribes. But there 
were many ways that a clever 
man might take toward the free- 
living frontiers. The first flash of 
the intergalactic beacon might be 
the signal of his fortune. His 
tawny eyes flared again. 

“I thought you would be inter- 
ested,” the warden said. “Let me 
speak to the director.” 

Even after that assurance, the 
actual orders seemed a long time 
coming. Scarlet sat for three days 
grimly pretending to work, fight- 
ing a cold fear that his tampering 
with the records had been dis- 
covered. When at last Thomwall 
came up and clapped him on the 
back, he gasped with terror in 
spite of himself. 

“Uh — ” He caught a quick 



breath and captured control of 
himself. “Yes, sir?” 

“The director wants to see you.” 
A luminous smile reassured him. 
“You’re going to get the break I 
SF>oke of. About time, too!” 

Y’ET his knees were trembling 
when he walked in to face the 
director, whose muscular perfec- 
tion gleamed through a film of 
steely dust. He wanted to sit 
down, but the sleek metallic god 
kept him standing half a minute, 
probing him with keen gray eyes 
which glinted with the passionless 
authority of perfect psionic con- 
ditioning. He couldn’t help cring- 
ing. 

“Nervous, Scarlet?” 

He nodded, grinning stiffly 
through his secret misery. 

“Not that I blame you.” With a 
cool steel smile, the giant allowed 
him to sit. “After all your years 
in this easy berth, you must dread 
being uprooted.” 

His greater fear was that he 
might appear too eager. 

“I have been very happy here, 
sir,” he agreed, in a voice which 
he tried to make regretful. “I hate 
to leave my marriage group, and 
I’ve a number of hobbies that I 
don’t like to interrupt.” 

The metal god nodded sympa- 
thetically. 

“Sun-diving, for one.” Actually, 
he detested the sport because his 
imperfect integration had left him 



12 



GALAXY 



dangerously inept with the psi- 
onic diving gear. But a nervous 
compulsion drove him on. “Just 
bought an outfit from a friend 
who got transferred. He’s been 
diving into sunspots, looking for 
the famous living lights. He had 
a theory they’re intelligent — ” 

“Perhaps they are.” The direc- 
tor’s nod froze his apologetic grin. 
“I don’t know how any complex of 
ions and electromagnetic energy 
can support intelligence, but I’ve 
brought back some queer psio- 
graphs from my own dives.” 

“Anyhow, I’ll be selling my 
gear.” Alarmed, Scarlet retreated 
as hastily as if the director had 
suddenly become a hissing solar 
fireball. “I wasn’t quite prepared 
for such a mission. But the service 
comes first.” 

“We’re living for the worlds we 
watch.” The steel man intoned 
that old slogan so solemnly that 
Scarlet felt an imcomfortable 
prickling at the back of his neck. 
“We left our own worlds behind 
once and for all when we took the 
service oath.” 

“I’m not looking back, sir.” His 
palms-were clammy from a sud- 
den fear that he had overdone his 
appearance of reluctance, but his 
eyes were on the new worlds 
ahead. “Though I suppose I’ve 
been here a little too long. I had 
almost forgotten how it feels to 
board a neutrionic flyer to skip 
down across a dozen or a hundred 



years, knowing that you can’t 
come back.” 

“That’s our destiny.” The mag- 
nificent man paused to study the 
records Scarlet had altered, so 
closely that he shuddered. “A bad 
situation, out there on Sol III. 
Frankly, Scarlet, I was hesitant to 
send a man of your incomplete 
conditioning. Especially one with- 
out field experience. But we’ve too 
many planets to watch, and too 
few dedicated men.” 

SCARLET gulped and decided 
^ not to trust his voice. He sat 
sweating, trying not to think of 
the rivals who should have ranked 
above him. 

“I’m a little surprised that 
we’ve kept you here so long.” The 
director gave him a quicksilver 
smile. “But this situation is apt to 
call for all you’ve learned in these 
hundred years.” 

Scarlet scanned the little stack 
of psionic dispatches that he 
pushed across the desk, trying to 
absorb them as swiftly as if he 
really rated five. Thomwall’s 
briefing helped him decide upon 
a troubled frown. 

“This last report from Sol III is 
already fifty years old.” His con- 
cern grew swiftly genuine. “I’ll be 
at least that long getting there by 
the regular routes. What can I 
expect to find?” 

“Your problem. Warden.” The 
director was already turning, 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



13 



reaching for another stack of dis- 
patches. “The finite speed of our 
communications is all that makes 
your mission necessary. In a con- 
tact crisis, we must have a respon- 
sible man on the spot.” 

“Trust me, sir.” Scarlet spoke 
with a pious gratitude for that 
finite limite upon the velocity of 
every sort of signal, even upon the 
flash of the intergalactic blinker. 
By the time any report of his de- 
cision could come back here, he 
would be so far beyond Sol that 
no possible pursuit could ever 
overtake him. “I’ll be on guard.” 

“You’ll need to be,” the steel 
man admonished him. “A contact 
crisis draws all sorts of people. 
Some pure as light. Some more 
savage than the savages we 
guard.” 

He boarded the supply ship 
next morning, carrying most of 
his material possessions in one 
small bag. The true rewards of the 
service were the joys of service 
itself. So they said. Certainly he 
had received very little besides. 

He was glad enough to aban- 
don what he had to leave behind, 
the too-risky sun-diving and the 
dabbling in psionic art and the 
aimless multiculture with which 
he had tried to kill the idle years. 
He couldn’t help feeling a secret 
relief even at the separation from 
his marriage group, although he 
tried to make a convincing display 
of regret. 



He even asked Glade to come 
with him. She was the sultry if 
somewhat shallow blonde who 
had always insisted that she was 
simply fascinated with his phe- 
nomenal ugliness, but now he was 
not surprised when she chose to 
remain with her more handsome 
husbands and the civilized ameni- 
ties of the station. 

T he flyer caught the neutrionic 
streams, the vast winds of in- 
visible neutrinos that burst from 
the novas and blow through the 
galaxies at almost the speed of 
light. Velocity foreshortened time. 
A long quarter-century on the 
planets ahead and behind was 
only a few weeks for Scarlet. 

He was still elated with the 
wine of one more triumphant 
escap>e from all the perfection he 
hated, when the flyer touched at 
Procyon Station. 

In the spaceport bar, he bought 
a drink for a service courier from 
the Regulus region and asked for 
news of Earth. 

“Light’s so damned slow,” he 
grumbled, disguising the casual 
boast about his mission. “A con- 
tact crisis comes up on a world 
like Earth, and it’s out of hand 
before you can get there to do 
anything about it. What about 
Earth?” 

The courier looked blank. 

“Sol III,” Scarlet said.. 

“Oh, we touched there.” The 



14 



GALAXY 



courier grinned maliciously. “Bet- 
ter take along a durable woman 
and a good library, if you’re wait- 
ing for those quarrelsome apes to 
civilize themselves.” 

“Huh?” Scarlet downed his 
drink uncomfortably. “Aren’t they 
near contact?” 

“Not that I heard about.” 
“They were firing military 
rockets a hundred years ago.” he 
protested hopefully. “They’ll be 
getting into space.” 

“But not for any peaceful pur- 
pose. They were groping toward 
fusion bombs, when we picked up 
those dispatches. They’ll soon be 
blowing the crust off their grubby 
little planet. Even if they do 
blunder into our outpost, it 
doesn’t mean that thes^’re fit for 
civilized society. 

“Time for another?” 

Scarlet blinked at his time ring. 
“Thanks, but my ship will be 
lifting.” 

He hurried back aboard, frown- 
ing gloomily. 

After a few worried weeks of 
ship .time, he watched Sirius flare 
out ahead like a natural nova. 
The news of Sol III was twenty 
years fresher, but still distressing. 

“Larger tribes are fighting big- 
ger wars with better weapons.” 
The post communications officer 
grinned sardonically. “If they do 
make contact, thes^l probably at- 
tack us with fusion bombs. We’re 
the ones who need protection!” 



“They may be troublesome.” 
Slowly tightening muscles ac- 
cented the ugliness of Scarlet’s 
pinched and chinless face, imtil 
the better-integrated man looked 
uncomfortably away. “But I’ll 
civilize them,” he muttered defi- 
antly. “If they are human at all!” 
Perhaps they were not, he re- 
flected silently. Perhaps he would 
have to approve the blinker proj- 
ect, after all. But, before he de- 
cided to let the supernova flash, 
he intended to be well paid for 
his decision. His first concern was 
the source of his payment.

TTE was alert for the scent of 
money when the flyer 
touched at Proxima Station. He 
got off to sniff for it, and caught 
only the odor of trouble. The 
restless anthropoids had fired 
rockets into space, but the radia- 
tion zones had slowed their efforts 
to reach the satellite of Earth. 

Wandering unhappily back to 
the flyer, he foimd a girl at the 
lock ahead of him. A deck officer 
had blocked her way. She was 
protesting in some liquid-toned 
tongue he had never heard be- 
fore, so vehemently that he 
snapped on his psionic translator. 

“ — unconditioned blunder!” 

The sense of her ringing words 
came suddenly through. “You can 
see that my passage was cleared 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



15 



through your own transportation 
office.” 

“You may come.” The officer 
nodded grudgingly. “But not your 
rubbish.” 

Scarlet heard the indignant 
catch of her breath, as the officer 
gestured stubbornly at a moun- 
tain of packing cases stacked be- 
side the ramp. In response to his 
glance, their blank labels flashed 
with words that he could read as 
if in his native tongue: 

CONTENTS: PSIONIC CON- 
DITIONING EQUIPMENT 
CONSIGNOR: BRIAR- 

STONE MISSION 
CUSTODIAN: CORAL FELL 
DESTINATION: SOL III 
The labels faded as his eyes 
went back to Coral Fell. 

“It isn’t rubbish and it isn’t 
mine,” she was warmly informing 
the officer. “It belongs to the 
people of Sol III. They’re near a 
contact crisis. The moment the 
quarantine is raised, they’ll need 
help. I’m going out there to open 
a psionic training center, to help 
them make the difficult jump to 
civilization. All this is just the 
barest essential equipment for our 
first clinic — ” 

“No matter if it’s a captive liv- 
ing light, this is not a common car- 
rier,” the officer snapped. “Our 
limited cargo space is already 
filled with supplies for Sol Sta- 
tion. Wait for a freighter.” 

“But there won’t be any fre- 



freighters.” A sob shattered her 
well-conditioned confidence. “Not 
till the quarantine is raised. Nor 
another supply ship for three 
whole years — ” 

“Too bad.” He shrugged un- 
sympathetically. “But we’re lift- 
ing off.” 

“Wait!” Her desperate voice 
fell, but the translator still caught 
her words. “I’ve funds of my own. 
Maybe we can reach some private 
understanding.” 

“I’m the wrong man to bribe!” 
The officer recoiled in indignation. 
“I can see to it that you aren’t 
allowed off any ship at Sol Sta- 
tion!” 

^HE turned, and Scarlet shrank 
from her angry loveliness. 
Her long hair shone with blue 
psionic moons, and her mouth was 
a quivering golden slash across 
her exquisite lean face. With tears 
burning in her violet eyes, she 
stalked toward him blindly. 

‘Warden Scarlet!” The deck 
officer moved to meet him with an 
unexpected graciousness. “So 
you’re already seen the sights of 
Proxima — ” 

“You’re a service executive?” 
Suddenly she saw him — but 
somehow not his ugliness. Her 
smile illuminated him. “Could you 
help me?” 

“Perhaps I can.” He turned 
briskly to the officer. “When the 
quarantine is lifted, the natives 



16 



GALAXY 



will need all the help they can get. 
We’re taking Coral Fell and all 
her cargo. In my own suite, if 
necessary.” 

“Yes, sir.” The officer had be- 
come somewhat purple, but he 
nodded stiffly. “I’ll arrange the 
space, sir.” 

“Thank you. Warden!” Her kiss 
took his breath, before he had 
time to reflect that she must have 
come from a world of more casual 
conventions than his own. “How 
can I ever repay you?” 

“I wish no pay.” Uncomfort- 
ably, he disengaged himself. In 
his judiciary position, he could 
hardly ask outright for the bribe 
the deck officer had refused. Deal- 
ing with her was going to require 
a delicate tact. “But — uh — shall 
we meet aboard for dinner?” 

She met him for dinner, won- 
drous in a gown of woven psionic 
filaments that reflected all his 
thoughts and moods in their flow 
of patterned color, and always 
amplified his responses to her 
beauty. She was far more, he soon 
discovered, than merely a dedi- 
cated missionary. 

He cringed from her shimmer- 
ing perfection, with his old uneasy 
defiance, but she was somehow 
neither fascinated nor repelled 
by his total ugliness. She 
simply failed to notice. Perhaps, 
he thought, she had lived on some 
frontier where aesthetic surgery 
was not the fashion. Or perhaps 



his very deformity appealed to 
the same generosity that had 
brought her to aid the natives of 
Earth. 

“So the whole future of these 
planets is yours to decide?” Her 
warm admiration overwhelmed 
his remaining defenses. “Isn’t that 
an awfully important decision to 
be left to just one man?” 

He caught his breath to assure 
her that he had been long trained 
for his task, and his fitness care- 
fully tested. But when he remem- 
bered how he had secretly insured 
his own selection, a wave of 
shame submerged him. 

Fortunately, their food was be- 
ing served. There were dishes he 
had never seen before, and by the 
time she had informed him that 
these were multicultured bioforms 
from Proxima II, he had begun to 
recover from his unexpected con- 
fusion. 

iWnPHE service is a volunteer 
organization,” he muttered 
awkwardly. “Though of course we 
do have official status. Our trouble 
is that so few people ever volun- 
teer to leave their own times and 
planets, to go voyaging down 
through strange worlds and ages, 
giving their lives to guard ignor- 
ant savages. We never have men 
enough. But we do what we can.” 

“We are volunteers, ourselves.” 
She nodded sympathetically. “I 
joined the mission because of my 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



17 



father. A galactic buccaneer, my 
mother used to call him. He 
owned a great fleet of neutrionic 
flyers. He used to operate out to- 
ward the Edge, looting new 
worlds of everything portable, us- 
ing his profits to build more flyers 
and loot more worlds. All legal 
enough, but Mother taught me 
not to like it. When I inherited his 
fortune, I came back to these for- 
gotten worlds at the Center, to 
return what he had taken.” 

Inwardly elated at this news 
of all she had to give away. Scar- 
let began cautiously trying to con- 
vey the idea that he would be re- 
ceptive. He admitted over the 
wine that he had long ago lost the 
youthful illusions that led him to 
volunteer. 

“I can remember when the feel- 
ing of it made me tingle all over,” 
he told her. “Skipping down the 
centuries, watching over all the 
retarded worlds as they clamber 
up out of the jungle. The trouble 
is, they take too long. They stum- 
ble too often, and fall back too 
far. We’ve been guarding Earth 
for five thousand years.” 

He tingled again, in her admir- 
ing glow. 

“Frankly, Coral, I have decided 
to leave the service as soon as I 
can afford it. I’m sick of the disci- 
pline, the long monotony, all the 
sacrifices. I want a decent living 
and a permanent family.” 

As she smiled, the psionic fibers 



of her gown made a veil of rosy 
flame in which their reflected 
pleasures in each other flowed 
into a mingled radiance. He 
thought for an instant that he had 
made his point. 

“To your new future!” She 
clinked her glass against his. “I 
think you’re wise to resign, be- 
cause I’ve never agreed with the 
quarantine philosophy. It seems 
almost criminal to let a world like 
Earth stumble in the dark for five 
thousand years, when psionic 
training could civilize it in two or 
three generations.” 

“To your mission on Earth!” 
He drained the wine, trying not 
to think of all the young civiliza- 
tions that had been destroyed by 
premature contact. “If I can lift 
the quarantine.” 

That was as plain as he dared 
to be, but still she failed to under- 
stand. His own dismay quenched 
all the burning glory of her gown, 
leaving her nearly nude beneath 
the dead gray filaments, as she 
leaned to kiss his glass again with 
her own. 

“To our new Earth!” she 
breathed. “Let’s make it that! 
You’ll find yourself again, in the 
exciting work of civilizing the 
planet. You and I, together — ” 
Panic shook him. 

“Wait for my decision!” he mut- 
tered desperately. “You’re forget- 
ting that Sol III has not yet quali- 
fied for civilization. Unless I find 



18 



GALAXY 



groimds for granting galactic citi- 
zenship, the planet will be incin- 
erated.” 

Ill 

glowing gown faded pale 
with shock, when he told her 
about the blinker project. 

“Wain, how can you consider 
that?” Her widened eyes were 
black. “The murder of a world? 
Murder multiplied three billion 
times!” 

“The extinction of the native 
culture may appear deplorable,” 
he told her. “But it won’t be mur- 
der, really. Not unless the natives 
are granted human status.” 

“But they are people, Wain!” 
Her face glowed again, with a 
pleading urgency. “One social 
worker from our mission spent 
months there, bundled up in their 
horrid fiber clothing, disguised as 
a medical student. He examined 
hundreds of them. Physically, 
they’re as fully human as we are.” 
“Human status depends on 
mental attainments,” he reminded 
her craftily. “Or, to be more ac- 
curate, it depends in this particu- 
lar case upon my own considered 
judicial decree.” 

Even then, she didn’t under- 
stand. To her well-conditioned 
innocence, a deputy warden stood 
far above any possibility of cor- 
ruption. Her pure illusions were 
immune to the boldest hints he 



dared to make, as red Proxima 
dimmed behind and died. 

The bribe he wanted, she might 
never pay. But all her innocence 
failed to restrain her from using 
the arts of psionics to press upon 
him another kind of bribe, which 
included herself. She seemed to 
mind neither the jut of his rodent 
teeth nor the squint of his yellow 
eyes nor even his own sadly 
botched conditioning. 

All the way to Sol, she talked 
of her magnificent plans for 
Earth. The equipment he had 
rescued would barely fit out the 
first psionic training center. But 
she had funds to purchase more. 
Her staff would be pitifully inade- 
quate at first, even if he decided 
to join her mission, but the 
natives they trained would soon 
be scattering out to open new cen- 
ters in every jungle village. 

At the end of the flight, they 
were sitting together in the ocular 
dome when the airless satellite 
eclipsed the driving glare of Sol. 
Earth still burned in the black 
space ahead: a thin, green-veined 
crescent, one horn tipped with a 
dazzle of ice. Watching, Coral 
caught her breath with a tiny 
gasp of pure delight. 

“So beautiful!” she breathed. 
“So wonderful and new! Every 
opportunity I’ve come so far to 
find!” 

Scarlet nodded, but his eyes 
hardly left her. With an ultimate 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



19 



missionary zeal, she had rinsed 
her hair with a psionic wash that 
came to flaming life with h’er joy, 
and powdered her body with a 
dust that caught and amplified all 
his feelings of desire in a glitter of 
diamond points. 

“Say you’ll stay. Wain!” She 
caught his hand. “In a couple of 
hundred years, we’ll have civiliza- 
tion blooming here!” 

“But I’m not — uh — completely 
conditioned,” he reminded her 
uncomfortably. “In that time, I’d 
be getting into — uh — middle 
age.” Watching her hair turn dull 
with his own discomfort, he mut- 
tered bleakly, “I’m getting out 
where life is worth living, as soon 
as my duty here is done.” 

“But, Wain!” The psionic dust 
turned cold and blue upon her, 
reflecting her distress. “I can’t just 
abandon the mission. And you 
know that our work here will take 
a good two or three hundred 
years.” 

“Your work,” he said unhap- 
pily- 

TTOWEVER magical it might 
seem to those without it, psi- 
onic training required toil and 
time. To become fully effective, 
the pre-conditioning had to begin 
at the instant of conception, 
guided by pre-conditioned par- 
ents. The first generations were 
always awkward half-things, lost 
between worlds, as he himself had 



been. He wanted no more of their 
hop)eless yearnings and inevitable 
defeats. 

“Stay!” She leaned toward him, 
bathed in a sudden glow of devo- 
tion. “We’ll be married the day 
you leave the service. My own 
conditioning will help complete 
yours. And you will find our work 
worth everything. A thousand 
years on Earth won’t be too long, 
now that we’re in love.” 

In spite of himself, he almost 
took her in his arms. 

Less than half conditioned, he 
had little immunity to her psionic 
lure. Yearning to kiss the cold 
green blaze of her mouth, he 
shivered with despair. He thought 
everything was lost. 

But darkness fell across the 
dome. He looked out to see the 
black-toothed rim of the moon ris- 
ing to gnaw the jeweled Earth 
away, as the flyer fell to land. 
Grateful for the interruption, he 
squirmed desperately away. 

“What’s wrong. Wain?” 

Her wounded voice tore at him, 
but he refused to look back at her 
psionic charms. He stood watch- 
ing the crescent Earth until its 
last glitter was gone. 

“Tell me, dear,” she begged 
him. ‘Whatever’s wrong, I want 
so to help you. But your late con- 
ditioning disturbs your reactions. 
You’re hard for me to under- 
stand.” 

He felt grimly thankful for that 



20 



GALAXY 



dark veil across his mind. He 
couldn’t tell her, but he was get- 
ting back his balance. She had 
swayed him dangerously, but he 
would surely find other lovely 
women glad enough to overlook 
his ugliness after he was rich. He 
had already squandered far too 
much of his short life for the hol- 
low rewards of the service; he 
didn’t intend to give up the rest 
of his youth for her. Surely, some- 
body else would pay him to raise 
the quarantine. 

“Darling — ” Alarm caught her 
voice. “Don’t ever think I feel 
above you!” 

“Of course I don’t.” He stared 
into the dark, afraid to look at her. 
“But we’re landing now. I’ve — 
I’ve just recalled my duty.” 

“I don’t see — ” 

“I am a deputy warden.” He 
was deliberately gruff. “I have 
come here to decide the future of 
a planet. The rules and traditions 
of the service do not allow me to 
become intimate with anyone who 
has a special interest in my deci- 
sion.” 

“Is that all?” She laughed 
breathlessly. “You silly dear! You 
don’t know how much you need 
re-conditioning. But I do respect 
your principles. I’ll stop pestering 
you until Earth has been admit- 
ted to civilization.” 

He gave her an uneasy glance, 
and fovmd her only normally al- 
luring. The flyer lurched and 



swayed, settling upon the satel- 
lite. They turned together to look 
for Sol Station. Here it was night. 
As his eyes adjusted to the cold 
starlight, apprehension touched 
him. 

¥ TPON the dead plain, a few 
^ small hummocks of naked 
stone stood clustered around a 
cruel black peak. Far away, a 
curving wall of ragged rock closed 
them in. 

He saw nothing else. 

“It’s all magnificent!” she 
whispered, before her first delight 
was clouded with bewilderment. 
“But where is the station?” 

“Still camouflaged.” He pointed. 
“Those rock hummocks are 
painted membranes, if you know 
how to look, inflated to hide the 
neutrionic flyers on the field. The 
main installations are in that 
peak, and imderneath. See!” 

He nodded toward a glint of 
moving metal in a dummy crater- 
let. A hidden airlock opened. 
Belted spacemen rose into view, 
riding the arms of a multiple 
crane, hoisting billowing mem- 
branes. 

“What are they doing?” 
“Rigging a screen to hide us,” 
he told her. ‘We’ll be getting off 
as soon as it’s inflated.” 

She said she had to go below to 
finish packing, and then lingered 
in the dome, watching him so 
sharply that he stiffened. Al- 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



21 



though he understood that ad- 
vanced conditioning included a 
taboo against uninvited mental 
prying, he couldn’t help an un- 
easy resentment of her psionic 
superiority. 

“Go ahead,” he snapped. “I’ll 
meet you down at the lock.” 

“You’re worried. Wain.” Her 
warm concern assured him that 
she had not been picking any 
guilty secrets from his mind. 
“Why?” 

“That camouflage.” He ges- 
tured at the hummocks clumped 
below the mountain. “It’s too 
good. The station is still con- 
cealed. I see no native rockets. I’m 
afraid we’re here too soon.” 

When he walked down the 
ramp from the lock, a few minutes 
later, into the cavernous tent that 
had been rigged to hide the flyer, 
the station commandant was wait- 
ing to greet him with the formali- 
ties due his rank and mission. 

Commander Newbolt was a 
lean blond giant, who enhanced 
his virile presence with a liberal 
use of psionic cosmetics. Scarlet 
heard the sharp intake of Coral’s 
breath when she first saw the 
shining mantle of magnified mas- 
culinity that revealed his muscu- 
lar beauty, and hated him in- 
stantly. 

Had Earth made contact? 

Scarlet was asking that urgent 
question, with every anxious 
glance at everything around him. 



but he refused to speak it. He 
answered each austere formality 
in kind, until Newbolt had com- 
pleted the ritual. 

“Your accommodations are 
ready, sir. Down in Tunnel Seven. 
I hope you find them adequate, 
because I believe you’re going to 
be here for some time.” 

“The crisis?” He couldn’t stop 
the question now. “Have the na- 
tives arrived?” 

“Not yet, sir.” 

“Why not?” He tried to gulp his 
panic down. “They were reported 
entering a contact crisis a hun- 
dred years ago. I expected to 
find their rockets here.” 

"O EVULSION from his ugliness 
and contempt for his judg- 
ment was thinly veiled behind 
the smug satisfaction of Newbolt’s 
thin-lipped smile. 

“I’m afraid you’ll discover that 
my predecessor was badly mis- 
taken when he prepared for such 
an early crisis here. I urged him 
at the time not to send for you.” 
Scarlet glared up at the tower- 
ing commander, bracing himself 
for trouble. He could already see 
that Newbolt was stupid enough 
to take a very dangerous attitude 
toward bribery. 

“How’s that?” he rapped. 
‘Weren’t the natives about to 
reach this satellite.” 

“They have jjrashed their clum- 
sy litle rockets here.” Newbolt 



22 



GALAXY 



f 

nodded contemptuously. “But 
even if they ever lived to discover 
us, they aren’t fit for civilization. 
Their culture is sick with a path- 
ological militarism.” 

“I’ll give due weight to your 
opinion,” Scarlet jabbed. “When 
I come to judge their fitness.” 
Newbolt remained undevas- 
tated. 

‘We have been assembling evi- 
dence for Your Equity’s consider- 
ation. When your flyer was 
sighted, I ordered all human be- 
ings in the solar system to gather 
for your inquiry.” 

“Thank you.” 

“My own recommendation will 
be that you approve the signal 
project,” Newbolt added. “I’m 
convinced that our long vigil here 
has been a waste of time. The 
natives have been growing more 
numerous and more destructive, 
but hardly more human.” 

“I’ll ask for your advice when 
I require it,” Scarlet told him. 
“Please have my luggage taken to 
my quarters. Arrange for the hear- 
ing to begin without delay.” 

“Yes, Your Equity.” 

“Wain!” Coral Fell came float- 
ing toward them in a pink glow of 
admiration, her wide eyes fixed 
on Newbolt. “I want to meet the 
commander.” 

“I don’t think you’ll like him,” 
Scarlet warned her. “He is advis- 
ing me to approve the blinker 
project.” 



“Is he, though?” 

Unhappily, Scarlet introduced 
them. Her psionic powder shone 
like galactic dust, reflecting her 
delight and Newbolt’s manly 
pleasure. When she asked to go 
with them fo the hearing, New- 
bolt agreed without waiting for 
Scarlet’s permission. 

A crude mechanical elevator 
dropped them from the lock 
tower into the moon, so fast that 
Scarlet, not yet used to the light 
gravitation, had to snatch at a 
hand rail to keep his feet on the 
floor. 

A mile below, Newbolt escorted 
them briskly through a long gal- 
lery that was a museum of the 
guarded planet. Crystal cases 
stood filled with stone axes, rust- 
eaten blades and primitive robot 
missiles. 

“Our newest exhibit.” Newbolt 
paused at a niche where a sleek 
aluminum rocket hung against 
star-dusted emptiness above the 
ice-gemmed splendor of the cres- 
cent planet, “The first space ship 
from Earth.” 

“How’d you get it here?” 

“We followed it out from Earth. 
The natives were trying for the 
moon, but they ran into a burst 
of solar radiation too hot for their 
shielding. After they were dead, 
we salvaged their equipment.” 
He chuckled. “If they had known 
how closely we were watching — ” 
‘’‘You let them die?” Scarlet

interrupted. “Out here in space?” 
“ Y ou know the Covenants.” 
Newbolt shrugged, not very re- 
spectfully. “They had failed to 
make contact. Consequently, we 
couldn’t interfere.” 



IV 



IGHTY-SEVEN galactic citi- 
zens had responded to his 
call. Most of them were attached 
to the quarantine service, but 
others had sought these wilder- 
ness worlds for ends as varied as 
their interstellar culture. A trio 
of prospectors had been sifting 
through the asteroids. A primitive 
artist had been recording an epic 
fantasy of a wrecked flyer down 
on a rocky moon of Saturn, sur- 
rounded by the “phantom lights” 
of space legend. A mystic on Pluto 
had interrupted a hundred years 
of solitary contemplation, to at- 
tend the hearing. An archeologist 
had abandoned a dig on Mars. 
Half a dozen outside agents had 
hastily discarded their disguises 
as inhabitants of Earth. 

Waiting under the old stone 
dome of the little auditorium, 
these legally human beings- had 
sorted themselves into three con- 
tending factions. 

“Beasts of prey!” Newbolt gave 
the nearest group a snarl of con- 
tempt. “Rumors of the crisis have 
been spreading out through space 
for a century now. These wolves 



have come swarming in, howling 
for leave to loot the planet.” He 
chuckled. “The signal project 
serves them properly!” 

Scarlet made no answer. Robed 
in his blue official light, he 
mounted to his bench and waited 
sternly for Newbolt to silence the 
chapiber. His feral eyes narrow 
with his most judicial scowl, he 
studied the three hostile factions. 

Newbolt was marching toward 
the neatly seated contingent from 
the quarantine station. Coral 
shimmered beside him, clad in 
golden dust and the cascade of 
psionic fire falling from her waist. 
Scarlet tightened his bony jaws, 
turning painfully away from her 
magnified allure. 

The hermit, his detached head 
blind and cadaverous in its crystal 
cell, had wheeled himself to join 
the three lean young men in the 
plain space dress of the signal 
service. Scarlet frowned disap- 
provingly at their contented pov- 
erty, and looked for the beasts of 
prey. 

The straggling group down at 
his left included the bearded 
artist and the spaceworn prospec- 
tors, among half a dozen others. 
They looked like feeble beasts. 
He saw no evidence of the wealth 
he wanted. 

TTUNCHED and ugly on the 
bench, he droned the official 
formula which invoked the olden 



24 



GALAXY 



justice of man. His voice was as 
ugly as his knobby angularity, 
slurred and harsh and high. 

“A routine affair,” he rasped, 
and paused again to savor the 
pain of the beautiful men. “We’ll 
dispense with formality, to get at 
the facts. I’ll summarize the briefs. 
The natives of Sol III are re- 
ported near contact crisis. Social 
workers are waiting to usher them 
into civilization. Their qualifica- 
tions for human status have been 
challenged, however, and the sig- 
nal service has filed notice of in- 
tention to appropriate Sol for use 
as an intergalactic beacon.” Look- 
ing sourly for Coral, he found her 
now at the back of the room, 
glowing over a stooped little 
stranger. “A few individuals have 
seen fit to protest — ” 

“Certainly we protest!” She 
started toward the bench, towing 
the stranger. “Because Sol is not a 
barren star. Earth has three bil- 
lion native inhabitants, whose 
human rights must be protected.” 

“Human?” He let his voice 
grate unpleasantly. “I understand 
that all human beings on these 
threatened planets were ordered 
to assemble here. I don’t count 
three billion.” 

“Of course they can’t obey psi- 
onic orders, because they don’t 
know psionics! But now I know 
they’re human.” She hauled the 
wispy stranger toward him. “This 
is Mark Whitherly, the anthro- 



pologist. He found on Mars — ” 

“Please, Miss Fell!” Newbolt 
intercepted her. “You’re here as a 
guest. You can’t interrupt the 
proceedings.” 

“Never mind. Commander.” 
Scarlet smiled to welcome a pos- 
sible bribe. “I won’t be bound by 
any red tape. I intend to explore 
every source of evidence.” 

Newbolt muttered and sat 
down. 

Scarlet waited, watching Coral 
and her discovery. The anthropol- 
ogist, with his shuffling gait and 
his trembling hands and his dry 
yellow skin drawn tight over fine 
old bones, looked a good five hun- 
dred years overdue for euthan- 
asia. The dull blue dust of his 
scholarly robe reflected nothing 
of Coral’s bright excitement. 

“Listen, Wain!” she was bub- 
bling. “Mark has found evidence 
— proof you can’t ignore! Now 
you will have to lift the quaran- 
tine at once. And you will disap- 
prove the blinker project.” 

“I’ll listen.” Scarlet frowned 
doubtfully. “To any actual evi- 
dence.” 

DO have evidence.” The old 
scholar spoke slowly but 
clearly, in a child’s high voice. 
“Your Equity, I have been watch- 
ing this planet at intervals for two 
thousand years. It is my great ex- 
periment.” 

“What sort of experiment?” 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



25 



“A study in cultural collision.” 
The dull dust brightened now 
with an eagerness that made the 
old man seem oddly boyish. “You 
hear a lot of theories about what 
happens when our galactic civili- 
zation impinges upon primitive 
societies. You hear that the primi- 
tives are usually benefited, and 
you hear that they are usually 
destroyed. I have been waiting for 
this crisis, preparing to settle that 
question scientifically. Now that 
the moment has come — ” 

“Has it come?” 

“It has!” A single comic lock of 
yellow hair waved above old 
Whitherly’s bobbing head. "I 
have been watching the natives 
fumble closer to contact. They 
have observed our psionic moni- 
tors — which they call dirigible 
dishes. They have written books 
about us. Their rockets have 
reached this satellite. All they 
lack is your formal recognition of 
their human status.” 

“Your Equity, I object!” The 
signal officer was alertly on his 
feet, tanned and handsome even 
though he wore no cosmetics, al- 
most insolent. “I must inform you 
that our corps did not select suns 
at random for the intergalactic 
beacon. We traced the records of 
early migration, and chose a sec- 
tor which was evidently bypassed. 
If Whitherly is a real authority, I 
challenge him to show you one 
shard of evidence that human col- 



onists- ever landed anywhere on 
Earth.” 

Scarlet looked inquiringly at 
the worn old man. 

“I can’t do that,” Whitherly 
said. 

“Then how can you claim hu- 
man status for these filthy anthro- 
poids?” Smugly confident, the 
tall signalman turned to Scarlet. 
“Your Equity, since Whitherly ad- 
mits that he has discovered no 
evidence of biological relation- 
ship, which is the first essential 
qualification for human status, I 
move that this inquiry be closed 
with a formal order approving our 
signal project.” 

“Wain, wait!” Blue alarm shiv- 
ered around Coral. “You haven’t 
heard about Mark’s great discov- 

Scarlet looked impatiently 
back at the lean old man, noting 
sourly that he looked too poor to 
pay for the least satellite of these 
worlds he wished to save. 

“Penwright jumped to a false 
conclusion.” Whitherly nodded 
feebly toward the signal officer. “I 
do have proof that the natives of 
Earth are our human kin. If no 
colonists ever landed here, that is 
simply because the movement 
was in the other direction.” 

A PUZZLED hush whispered 
through the chamber. 

“Listen, Wain!” Coral breathed. 

“The first civilized observers 



26 



GALAXY 



here noted the odd fact that all 
life on Earth appears to have 
sprung from a single family tree,” 
Whitherly’s high voice resumed. 
“Now I know why. All my evi- 
dence supports the obvious ex- 
planation that this world is where 
human life evolved.” 

Swaying unsteadily, he paused 
for breath. 

“Tell them!” Flickering with a 
purple urgency. Coral caught his 
sticklike arm. “Tell them what 
you found on Mars.” 

“In the last few centuries,” he 
labored slowly on, “I have ex- 
tended my search to the desert 
planets. On Mars I found a buried 
human site, dating from more 
than twenty thousand years ago. 
My excavations reveal that primi- 
tive neutrionic flyers landed at 
the site. Some of them remained 
there, abandoned. But some of 
them went on, after they had 
been refitted to cross interstellar 
distances.” 

The blue dust glowed around 
him. 

‘The first neutrionic ships!” he 
whispered thinly. ‘They had 
brought primitive men from 
Earth to Mars. They carried our 
ancestors out to claim the galaxy.” 
Unsteadily defiant, Whitherly 
blinked at Penwright. “You can’t 
be allowed to murder our mother 
world!” 

‘That is loaded language.” 
Penwright chuckled tolerantly. 



“Your Equity, I submit that every 
planet within two hundred light- 
years has been claimed as the ori- 
ginal cradle of mankind. On none 
of them, unfortunately, has any 
reliable evidence survived. The 
wave of migration has left these 
Center worlds too far behind. The 
few that were ever civilized have 
been abandoned for twenty thou- 
sand years.” 

“I know galactic history,” Scar- 
let reminded him frostily. “I am 
competent to rule upon the evi- 
dence.” 

“You will act promptly?” Old 
Whitherly peered up anxiously. 
“You can see that my own time is 
running out. My younger associ- 
ates scattered when they heard 
of the blinker project. If there is 
any long delay, my chance to ob- 
serve the crisis will be lost.” 

“Your own misfortunes are ir- 
relevant.” 

“But, Wain! Why wait?” Coral’s 
urgency washed her with rain- 
bow opalescence. “Since the na- 
tives are our proven kinsmen, and 
since they are already landing 
their rockets on the moon, can’t 
you end the quarantine now?” 

Sadly, Scarlet shook his head. 
Whitherly’s sociological research, 
like her own educational program 
and Penwright’s signal project, 
seemed inconsistent with bribery. 
Their noble claims might make a 
useful cover for him when he 
came to pronounce his decision,

but that would have to wait until 
he had found a purchaser for 
Earth. 

“No.” He frowned severely at 
Coral. “Not yet.” 

“Not for a thousand years, my 
dear.” Newbolt’s smile beamed 
through rosy sparks of virile con- 
fidence. “Never, in my own 
opinion. If the blinker project is 
not approved, we shall have long 
centuries here to while away — ’’ 
“Wrong, Newbolt!” That loud 
hail boomed from the back of 
the dome, and Scarlet swung to 
see a big stranger stalking in. “I’m 
just up from Earth, with news 
about the crisis.” He paused, star- 
ing boldly up at Scarlet. “Your 
Equity, I have come to inform 
you that the natives are about to 
make a contact that can’t be ig- 
nored. They’ll be here in exactly 
twenty hours!” 

V 

S CARLET stood smiling down 
at the stranger, captured 
by an unrepaired ugliness more 
violent than his own. Long- 
chinned and broken-nosed, the 
man was bald as a boulder, 
burned dark as weathered cop>- 
per, splotched with livid scars 
where wounds must have been 
sewed up by savage surgeons. 
Sheer muscular bulk made him 
look grotesquely short. Almost 
nude, he required no psionic cos- 



metics to amplify his powerful 
animal vitality. 

Beckoning Newbolt to the 
bench. Scarlet whispered, ‘Who is 
he?” 

“Nobody with any right to 
waste our time.” The commander 
gave the stranger one contemptu- 
ous glance. “Another of these 
beasts of prey waiting for the 
quarantine to end — and alarmed 
now because the blinker project is 
about to vaporize the planet he 
came to devour.” 

Scarlet nodded silently, fascin- 
ated by the barbaric blaze of 
priceless natural diamonds at the 
stranger’s dark throat and on his 
gigantic hands. 

“An insterstellar pirate, who 
calls himself a trader.” Although 
the man was coming near, New- 
bolt refused to lower his .scornful 
voice. “Dirk Flintledge. A loud- 
mouthed nuisance, but I’ll soon 
dispose of him!” 

‘Wait! If he has news about the 
crisis — ” 

“He’s lying.” The commander 
glared at Flintledge, who had 
been intercepted by Coral Fell, 
her makeup all aglow with pink 
admiration. “My agents have in- 
filtrated the native centers of 
space research. They report no 
new flight attempts since the loss 
of the rocket we salvaged.” 

“But this man has been on Sol 
HIP” 

“Unfortunately, yes.” Indig- 



30 



GALAXY 



nantly, he turned his back on 
Coral and the trader. “Though not 
through any fault of mine. He 
arrived here before I relieved 
Commander Rivers, and was per- 
mitted to begin an imdercover 
commercial survey of the planet. 
A glaring indiscretion, I believe. 
I don’t trust such men to respect 
the Covenants.” 

“Let me talk to him.” 

‘Wain, this is wonderful news!” 
Haloed with glowing elation. 
Coral led the trader toward the 
bench. “Dirk says there is a native 
rocket coming to this very spot!” 
“Commander Newbolt ques- 
tions that information.” 

“His own information is in- 
complete.” Flintledge turned a 
hideous grin upon the startled 
commander. “This new rocket was 
built at a secret military installa- 
tion which his quarantine agents 
had failed to penetrate. It was 
laimched before I left the planet. 
It is already halfway to the 
moon. Its arrival will present you 
with a full-blown contact crisis.” 

Tj^LINTLEDGE licked his naked 
lips. 

“You see, some of the savage 
tribes are fighting what they call 
a cool war, which is forcing the 
development of space weapons. 
Native spies have been feeding 
each faction disturbing reports 
about the progress of the others. 
One tribe was told that it was in 



danger from an enemy space base 
on the moon. This rocket is the 
reply to that report.” His grin 
grew frightening. “Unfortunately 
for Newbolt’s policies, their 
planned impact point coincides 
with the location of this station.” 
“He’s lying!” Newbolt turned 
pale before his vicious ugliness. 
“He’s attempting to influence 
Your Equity.” 

“Wait and see.” The scarred 
man remained aS cheerfully mon- 
strous as a black stone god rotting 
in some jungle temple. “But I 
must inform you that the savages 
have armed their space ship with 
what they classify as fifty-mega- 
ton fusion missiles.” 

Newbolt’s bright attire flick- 
ered. 

“A moment. Your Equity.” He 
bent over his wrist communicator. 
“Let me check my monitors.” 
Scarlet waited, watching the 
trader, weighing his wealth, xmtil 
Newbolt spoke stiffly through a 
haze of angry blue. “Our monitors 
have detected an object moving 
out from Sol III. Its emanations 
indicate both nuclear devices and 
living bodies. Its trajectory will 
bring it toward this side of the 
satellite.” 

“Toward contact!” Eager 
sparks swirled aroimd Coral. 
“This is the crisis!” 

“A false contact!” Newbolt 
glared at the trader. “These 
natives had failed to find their

own way through the radiation 
zones. They must have received 
illicit information — including our 
own location here.” The blue dust 
glittered frostily. “Your Equity, I 
accuse Dirk Flintledge of a 
criminal violation of the Cove- 
nants.” 

“Now, sir.” Flintledge remained 
undismayed. “Why should you 
suspect me?” 

“Because you want to force a 
crisis,” Newbolt rapped. “Be- 
cause you have been down on the 
planet, among the builders of this 
rocket. Because I have received 
reports of your illegal methods in 
previous collisions with the quar- 
antine service.” 

“Such circumstances are not 
proof — ” 

“I’ll find proof.” Newbolt blazed 
balefully. “Your Equity, I intend 
to convict and punish this crimi- 
nal.” 

“He hasn’t much time to as- 
semble his evidence.” Flintledge 
smirked insolently at Scarlet 
“The natives will be here in 
twenty hours, with missiles that 
he can’t ignore. If he decides to 
intercept them in space, that act 
itself will be contact.” 

“I’ll rule on what is contact.” 
Scarlet tried to match the savage 
ugliness of Flintledge with the 
harshness of his own slurred and 
strident voice. “I’ll decide whether 
this man has violated the Cove- 
nants.” 



“But, Your Equity — ” 

Stem on the bench. Scarlet 
silenced Newbolt. He sat scowling 
judicially, wondering how to ne- 
gotiate with Flintledge without 
exciting dangerous suspicions. 
Tension was breathing under the 
dome. Glowing with a delicious 
violet alarm. Coral wanted to 
know how the station could be 
protected from the savage attack 
— unless he recognized the con- 
tact and lifted the quarantine. 

A BRUPTLY he recessed the 
inquiry, announcing that he 
wanted time to consider his ruling 
on the incident. He ordered New- 
bolt to monitor the savage rocket, 
but not to interfere with its flight 
Ignoring the startled murmur in 
the chamber, he asked Newbolt 
about the trader’s background. 

“He’s unconditioned.” Newbolt 
dropped his eyes from Scarlet’s 
own unconditioned ugliness, and 
hurried on. “Unconditioned and 
desperate. You see, he has made 
an unwise gamble on an early end 
of the quarantine. Now he is 
about to lose eveiything.” 

Watching from their small cell 
of silence. Scarlet saw Coral talk- 
ing to Whitherly, whose aged 
admiration seemed still warm 
enough to light her psionic lures. 
Flintledge and the signal officer 
were both waiting for her, as if 
her green-lipped smile mattered 
more than the intergalactic bea- 



32 



GALAXY 



con, the lives of three billion per- 
sons or the fate of Earth. 

“Is Flintledge wealthy?” Scarlet 
asked. 

“I suppose he has been.” New- 
bolt shrugged disapprovingly. 
“Made a fortune cheating savages, 
I suppose, and lost most of it as 
they picked up enough psionics to 
match his tricks. When he learned 
that Sol in was getting ripe, he 
mortgaged his ship for the capital 
to pluck it. I learned that from 
the competent young man who 
has followed him from the Bank 
of Vega to collect the loan. The 
money is due in just ten years. 
He’d need that time to dig it out 
of the natives, even if you lifted 
the quarantine today. If' you ap- 
prove the blinker project, he’ll 
have no time to look for another 
plum. He’ll be erased.” 

“I see.” Scarlet scowled to hide 
his elation. “Now please show me 
to my quarters.” 

He stopped outside the barrier 
to ask Coral to join him for din- 
ner. Responsive colors lit her psi- 
onic snares, but she already had a 
dinner date with Penwright. 
When he turned hopefully to look 
for Flintledge, the trader had al- 
ready gone. Disappointed, he let 
Newbolt take him down to his 
quarters. 

The bare little cell, two miles 
below the lock tower, was ade- 
quate enough. The service cher- 
ished a tradition of austere sim- 



plicity; he was used to nothing 
better. Yfet the thought of lonely 
centuries here, waiting for this 
world to fumble its own way to- 
ward a real contact, was enough to 
make him shiver. 

The signalmen were welcome 
to broil the planet — unless Flint- 
ledge would pay to save it. 

Too cautious to make the first 
overture. Scarlet killed time with 
his bath and depilation. He delib- 
erately spun a new official robe. 
Still waiting, he hesitated over his 
own meager stock of psionic 
scents and pKJwders, and decided 
once more that he needed the 
more powerful lure of wealth. 

Disappointed when Flintledge 
did not call, he went dully up to 
eat alone. Mark Whitherly way- 
laid him outside the dining 
lounge. While he ate, the shriv- 
eled little anthropologist tried to 
brief him on the native culture, 
and tried to find out how soon he 
meant to lift the quarantine. 

ii^T^HAT deponds.” He paused, 
even though he could see 
that the aged man was too high- 
minded to think of bribery. “I 
may be compelled to approve the 
signal project.” 

“You can’t!” Whitherly’s yelp 
held a satisfying anguish. “You 
can’t let these rash young fools 
bum the mother world and all its 
people — just to generate one flash 
of light!” 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



33 



“I’m aware of my duty in this 
situation.” Scarlet drew himself 
up stiffly, concealing an inward 
grin. “Ill yield to no improper 
pressures.” 

“I’m not tryng to bribe you.” 
Whitherly flushed and trembled 
with an agitation that alarmed 
Scarlet for his heart. “But I must 
remind you that your own superi- 
ors have approved my plan to 
observe this contact crisis.” 

“What sort of monster are 
you?” Certain now that the old 
scholar would never offer him 
money, Scarlet let indignation 
into his voice. ‘Would you risk 
destroying these people with a 
premature contact, simply for the 
opportunity to observe it?” 

“Certainly.” Whitherly gasped 
for his breath. “But I’m no mon- 
ster. I’m simply a scientist, trained 
to exclude all emotional consider- 
ations from the field of research. I 
refuse to price truth in terms of 
anything material. Even if you 
can’t understand that kind of 
idealism, perhaps you can under- 
stand in practical terms that what 
we learn from the sacrifice of this 
world can help us save a thousand 
others.” 

“I understand you,” Scarlet 
said. “But the Covenants apply.” 
“You—” 

Breathing unevenly, the old 
man contained whatever reckless 
words he had almost uttered. 
Scarlet crouched apprehensively. 



but Whitherly had been condi- 
tioned above any crude display of 
physical violence. Muttering 
something about the mother 
world, he shuffled unsteadily 
away. 

Left alone. Scarlet sat finger- 
ing the blank disk of his wrist 
transceiver, anxious to call Flint- 
ledge, but yet afraid. He gasped 
when the crystal lit with the 
trader’s image under his fingers, 
a bald and hideous doll. 

“I suppose I shouldn’t inter- 
rupt your delberations.” The 
black beads of eyes glittered sar- 
donically. ‘What with Penwright 
so anxious to light his blinker, and 
Coral Fell so eager to enlighten 
the native anthropoids, and old 
Whitherly dying to observe his 
contact crisis, your decision is al- 
ready difficult enough.” 

“I am pleased that you called,” 
Scarlet answered carefully. “I 
have been considering your own 
interest in the outcome of the 
crisis.” 

“If you care to come aboard for 
a drink,” Flintledge suggested 
smoothly, “we might consider it 
together — ^unless you fear that 
contact with me might tarnish 
your equity.” 

“Uh, thanks.” Scarlet could not 
help stiffening against the trader’s 
familiarity, but he managed to 
put down his righteous resent- 
ment. “I should like very much to 
come.” 



34 



GALAXY 



Newbolt would disapprove, he 
knew, but then his whole object 
was to escape the disapproval of 
such people forever. 

“My call must be brief,” he 
added. “I’m resuming the hearing 
in two hours.” 

He put on a space belt in the 
lock tower, and hurried out to the 
flyer. He found Flintledge be- 
neath the air lock, waving his 
arms and blustering at the men 
who had come with camouflage 
screens to turn the ship into a 
lunar peak. 

“That fool Newbolt thinks we 
can hide here,” he growled. “I 
know better. I don’t intend for 
those attacking savages to catch 
me sitting — unless Your Equity 
can reassure me.” 

Scarlet followed him through 
the lock. The rich immensity of 
the interstellar vessel had taken 
his breath at first, but now it be- 
gan whetting a resolution to ask 
for more than he had dared. 

VI 

TN the wanton luxury of the 
trader’s stateroom, a dancing 
figurine caught his dazzled eye. 
Poised upon the gem-stone inlay 
that topped a dark block of pol- 
ished wood, the tiny nude was 
featureless at first, an anonymous 
symbol of all feminine enchant- 
ment, cut with an exquisite econ- 
omy from some limpid crystal. 



But it came to life as he looked, 
reflecting all his own images of 
woman’s loveliness, refined and 
transfigured through the percep- 
tions of the artist who had fash- 
ioned its psionic matrix. Suddenly 
it was Coral Fell, but younger and 
more tender than the actual Coral, 
not quite so firm about the mouth, 
smiling adoringly. Its stark 
beauty stabbed through him, 
leaving a haunting ache of im- 
quenchable desire. 

“Like it?” 

Flintledge’s question startled 
him. He tore his attention from 
the figurine, flushing self-con- 
sciously, before he could remind 
himself that its resjxjnse to his 
mind had been a private thing. 
Even though he might suspect 
that Coral’s charms had begun to 
color its reaction to the trader, 
too, they had not met to quarrel 
over her. 

“Look around.” Flintledge 
squinted at him frightfully. “Any- 
thing you want, just let me 
know.” 

He certainly wanted a great 
deal more than a psionic figurine. 
Looking appraisingly around the 
magnificent stateroom, he found 
two pictures that arrested him. 
Stereos, in twin crystal plaques, 
they were also psionic. His re- 
flected thoughts brushed them 
with life and meaning, instantly. 

Two men . 

They made him shiver. One

was winning, one hideous. One 
was lean and young, a dashing 
smile on his hard brown face. The 
other was older, puffy, with sly 
cunning peering evilly through a 
pallor of fear. Yet somehow they 
were twins. 

Both of them were he. 
Shrinking in confusion, he 
turned to find the trader watching 
with an insolent amusement 
which angered him. 

“Uh — what are they?” 
“Perhaps I should apologize.” 
The trader’s chuckle was not apol- 
ogetic. “Psionic mirrors, you might 
call them. They are matrixed to 
reflect the self you wish to show 
the world, and the one you don’t. 
I like to watch my friends react.” 
Scarlet managed, with some 
effort, not to inquire how Flint- 
ledge saw himself. 

“I like — ^like your reaction.” 
The trader bellowed with coarse 
laughter. “But sit down.” He 
struggled to contain his amuse- 
ment. “I see that you need that 
drink.” 

l^HEY sat, while a psionic robot 
came with a strange bottle 
and two glasses of ice on a tray. 
Silently responsive to the trader’s 
wishes, it poured a fuming distil- 
lation over the ice. Scarlet sat 
back to taste it cautiously. Recov- 
ering now from his surge of im- 
conditioned resentment, he began 
to observe that Flintledge was no 



better conditioned than he him- 
self was. 

The bottle had come from Sol 
III. The savages called it whiskey, 
and there was nothing like it any- 
where. As the trader declaimed 
about its rare aroma. Scarlet saw 
the glass shaking in his scarred, 
enormous fist. Gulping it too fast, 
he strangled. 

“Won — Wonderful stuff!” 

Wheezing, he wiped at his eyes. 
“From a wonderful planet. I had 
discovered that, before our friends 
from the signal service got here 
with their incinerator. Wonderful 
wealth, that has never been 
touched!” 

Scarlet sipped the burning 
liquid, waiting impatiently for 
their game to reach the monetary 
moves. Flintledge coughed and 
recovered his voice, but his loud 
enthusiasm had a hollow ring. ' 

“Whole continents rich enough 
to mill!” His restless eyes stabbed 
at Scarlet, blades thrust through 
his jovial mask. “Oceans to ex- 
port! We can scrape the planet a 
hundred miles deep!” 

“I have studied some of the old 
surveys.” Scarlet nodded cau- 
tiously. “I’m sure the natural re- 
sources are still untouched. We’ve 
been on guard. But don’t they be- 
long to the natives?” 

“A miserable lot.” Flintledge 
shrugged. “Too backward to make 
any trouble. We can soon dispose 
of their nuclear weapons. The 



36 



GALAXY 



survivors may even be useful 
around our new installations, after 
Coral has tamed them with a 
pinch of psionics.” 

“They are — ^uh — my responsi- 
bility.”- Scarlet scowled sternly. 
“You must convince me that this 
contact is the culmination of their 
unaided progress toward civiliza- 
tion.” 

“I was waiting for that one.” 
Flintledge laughed too heartily 
again. “You knew that I’d infil- 
trated that tribal group, and 
you’re acute enough to infer that 
I’d guided them toward this con- 
tact.” 

“So you admit that you have 
forced a premature contact?” 

“On the contrary.” The trader’s 
unnatural merriment subsided; he 
sat blinking at Scarlet with bold 
black eyes. “But even if I should, 
my own testimony would be irrel- 
evant. As Your Equity is certainly 
aware, this contact is what you 
say it is.” 

Scarlet merely nodded, watch- 
ing him. 

Dull beads of sweat had come 
out on his unperfected face, be- 
traying his incomplete integra- 
tion. His battered fists clenched 
and trembled. He reached sud- 
denly for another whiskey. 

“Here, Your Equity!” Hastily 
draining the drink, he opened a 
file of bright psionic films. “I want 
to show you my plans to develop 
the planet.” 



^OOLLY, Scarlet scanned his 
designs for enormous instal- 
lations to harvest the guarded 
wealth of Earth. Dams to divert 
the excess oceans into export 
tanks. Mills to devour, continents. 
A heat-exchanging neutrionic net, 
to cool the deeper crust for the 
processing machines. Compres- 
sing stations, for the surplus at- 
mosphere. Ports for the trading 
fleets that would drain the plun- 
der into space. 

“Competent engineering.” Scar- 
let nodded casually. “You ought 
to make some money.” 

“I expect to.” His hoarse voice 
quivered with a tension that he 
could not completely contain. “In 
fact, I must. I have a large in- 
vestment, in my flyer and my 
trade cargo and my terraforming 
machinery, which I must protect.” 

“I see.” Scarlet turned cheerful- 
ly to a new survey of that wealthy 
room. “I suppose that any long 
delay would be expensive to 
you.” 

“It would kill me!” His harsh 
and sudden violence was startling, 
but then he grinned bleakly at the 
way Scarlet cringed. “I was talk- 
ing to Coral,” he added. “She tells 
me that you spoke of leaving the 
service.” 

“A foolish dream of my youth.” 
Wistfully grave. Scarlet shook 
his head. “An old dream of a new 
life, out among the new stars of 
the galactic frontier. If I had the 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



37 



means for a new start there, I’d 
quit the service today.” 

“Good.” The trader’s flinty grin 
began to soften. “I see that we can 
do business. With your service 
background, you’re just the man 
I need to handle my affairs with 
these anthropoids. If you’ll sign 
a contract with me for just a hun- 
dred years — ” 

“I won’t,” Scarlet said. “I’ve al- 
ready thrown too many centuries 
away, pampering savages.” 

“What else do you want?” 

“I — uh — ” Scarlet checked 
himself, to peer imeasily at the 
strange luxury around him. His 
throat felt dry. His temples 
throbbed. For a moment he 
wished that he had been more 
securely integrated — but then, of 
course, his psionic maladjustment 
was his secret strength. 

“We have privacy.” Flintledge 
winked appallingly. “Neither of 
us is likely to violate it.” He ges- 
tured for the robot. “Have another 
drink, and tell me what you 
want.” 

Weakly, Scarlet waved the 
robot away. 

“I want the flyer.” He gasped 
for his breath, blinking at his own 
audacity. “The flyer and half your 
cargo.” 

“If that is meant to be a 
joke—” 

“That’s my price.” 

The trader’s dark face turned 
yellow. Wheezing alarmingly, he 



gulped another whiskey. His 
great, dark hands spread into 
grasping talons, reached out sav- 
agely, and slowly sank. 

“You’re an unconditioned 
fool!” he breathed at last. “Why 
should I pay you such a price?” 

“If I had been better condi- 
tioned, I’d have nothing for sale,” 
Scarlet reminded him. “As things 
stand, I have nine planets on the 
block, one of them half-terra- 
formed and inhabited. I am offer- 
ing you a bargain.” 

“If I refuse — ” 

“I’ll approve the blinker proj- 
ect.” Scarlet laughed as unpleas- 
antly as possible. “You can look 
for another world to loot — if your 
Vegan bankers care to give you 
tim^” 

64'Y'OUR Equity is a hard 
trader!” Flintledge grinned, 
briefly revealing a pained admira- 
tion. “As two misfits, striving to 
heal our psionic scars with money, 
we ought to strike a reasonable 
bargain. But you know I can’t give 
up this flyer.” 

“With planets to sell, you can 
buy a better one.” 

“You’re unintegrated!” The 
trader’s voice lifted vehemently. 
“You don’t realize all the schem- 
ing, the waiting, the daring, the 
borrowing, the begging pretty 
men — ” 

“But I do realize.” Scarlet rose. 
“That’s how I know that you can’t 



38 



GALAXY 



afford to let me approve the 
blinker.” 

“Sit down!” Flintledge yelped. 
“Let’s have another drink, over a 
reasonable arrangement!” 

‘We have just concluded a 
reasonable arrangement,” Scarlet 
said. “I am going back to recon- 
vene the inquiry now. For the 
sake of appearances, I shall have 
to skim through the evidence, but 
I shall be forced to rule on the 
crisis before that savage ship 
arrives.” 

“Listen, Your Equity!” Flint- 
ledge was weeping. “Listen to 
reason!” 

“If you want a favorable rul- 
ing,” Scarlet interrupted him, 
“send your banker to the hearing. 
Let him bring formal legal con- 
veyances to the ship, half the 
trade goods and half the terra- 
forming gear. He can pass the 
documents up to me as a final 
packet of evidence.” 

“You have thought of every- 
thing!” 

“I hope!” A pale smile showed 
Scarlet’s rodent teeth. “I believe 
we understand each other. My 
ruling in your favor will not be- 
come final until I have actual pos- 
session of the flyer and my share 
of the cargo, with time for a start 
toward the stars.” 

“If Your Equity is absolutely 
unconditioned — ” 

“That’s our bargain.” Scarlet 
let his voice grate painfully. “Send 



me your banker.” He nodded 
curtly at the dancing figurine. 
“By the way, I’m keeping her.” 

“Fll leave the others, too.” 
Flintledge glanced sardonically at 
the two crystal plaques where 
Scarlet had seen his public and 
his private selves. “You will be 
needing them!” 

Silently, avoiding those dis- 
turbing mirrors. Scarlet turned to 

go. 

“I’ll prepare the documents.” 
Flintledge followed him anxiously 
toward the air lock. “I trust Your 
Equity to anticipate whatever dif- 
ficulties may be created for us by 
Newbolt and old Whitherly and 
the signal crew — ” 

Clothed in the cold blue purity 
of his judicial light. Scarlet spun 
a sound barrier to shut out the 
trader’s whining voice. He was 
drunk with elation, too drunk to 
fret with petty detail. 

The frontier stars were in his 
grasp. 

VII 

'’■''HE hearing dome was crowded 
again, the contending groups 
as breathlessly tense as if they 
had never been conditioned. Even 
the signal officer wore a restless 
look. Coral flashed Scarlet a 
green, uneasy smile. Newbolt rose 
ominously to report that his moni- 
tors were still tracking the savage 
attacker, which was no more than 
halfway to the moon. 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



39 



Concealing his elation, Scarlet 
resumed the inquiry with a re- 
quest for additional relevant evi- 
dence. 

Newbolt quickly offered a psi- 
onic tap>e recording the conse- 
quences of a casual illicit contact 
between a disguised quarantine 
officer and an unsuspecting native 
named Lenin. Scanning the tape 
in his most severe judicial man- 
ner, Scarlet found his wandering 
thoughts drawn imexpectedly 
back from the freedom of the 
frontier stars. In the uncondi- 
tioned native, he somehow saw 
himself. 

“Your Equity,” Newbolt urged 
him, “this record shows the un- 
readiness of these savages for any 
kind of contact with civilization. 
A native boy talks briefly with a 
civilized outsider. Neither intends 
any harm. But the native picks 
up ideas more dangerous than 
atomic theory to his fellow sav- 
ages!” 

“I’ll weigh the evidence.” Scar- 
let paused to scowl. “Are there 
other exhibits?” 

“Your Equity, please!” Coral 
fluttered brightly to the bench, 
bringing a tape from the frail 
ivory hands of old Mark Whith- 
erly. “There have been other con- 
tacts, with less harmful results. 
Here is the record of a case which 
proves that the natives are as 
highly civilized as you are.” 

Scarlet scanned the report of 



another accidental contact. A 
royal yacht from Altair II had 
been wrecked in space. One pas- 
senger had found his way to 
Earth. Alone among the savages, 
he had learned to like them. 
When a rescue expedition reached 
him, he refused to leave his native 
friends. 

“A touching display of senti- 
mental primitivism!” Penwright 
scoffed. “But the outcome is not 
surprising when you consider the 
dubiously human status of Altair 
II — which itself very narrowly es- 
caped our signal project.” 

Lazily insolent, he brought an- 
other exhibit to the bench. 

“Here, Your Equity, is evidence 
that contact with these verminous 
animals is full of unpredictable 
dangers — not only to them, but 
also to us!” 

The tape recorded the fate of 
a big-nosed peddler from the 
frontier worlds, who came to 
Earth to satisfy an unconditioned 
thirst for whiskey, and died there 
of something called a cold. 

“These sub-human worlds here 
at the Center face us with mys- 
teries greater than the flying 
lights, and enemies deadlier than 
we have met on the frontier 
planets.” The signalman radiated 
his cool, complacent beauty. 
“Your Equity must consider that 
the first flash of our beacon will 
sterilize all the malignant mutant 
micro-organisms that have been 



40 



GALAXY 




breeding here for thirty thousand 
years.” 

“ni consider ever 3 rthing.” 

CCARLET turned his carefully 
impatient frown upon old 
Mark Whitherly, who was wildly 
waving another p>sionic tape. Hid- 
ing his own growing concern 
about Flintledge, he watched 
Coral gliding to help the old man 
toward the bench. 

A sudden stir among the wor- 
ried quarantine people huddled at 
the door gave him a moment of 
hope that the trader or his banker 
had arrived at last, but the man 
who entered was only Newbolt, 
bringing a curt report that the 
savage rocket was drawing near 
the moon. 

“We have your decision now.” 
The commander’s muscular 
shoulders lifted majestically, as if 
tossing off his tattered respect for 
Scarlet. “For our own safety. Your 
Equity, we must either recognize 
this contact and welcome our visi- 
tors into universal civilization — 
or else deny their human status 
and allow the blinker projest to 
proceed.” 

“I’ll decide,” Scarlet rasped. 
“When I have weighed all the evi- 
dence.” 

He looked again for Flintledge, 
and decided that the trader was 
waiting to drive a harder bargain 
in another private meeting. 

“The inquiry is recessed,” he 



rapped abruptly. “Clear the cham- 
ber.” 

‘Wait, Wain!” Coral snatched 
Whitherly’s tape and rippled to- 
ward the bench. “Scan this before 
you decide.” Bright excitement 
cascaded from the psionic moons 
in her hair. “It’s more than proof 
that these people are human. It is 
proof that they are our own ances- 
tral race. It’s the clue that led 
Mark to the side of that prehis- 
toric space port on Mars. Please 
take time to scan it!” 

Ignoring the signals of con- 
tempt and alarm that were flick- 
ering between the cool signal offi- 
cer and the boiling commander. 
Scarlet took the tape from Coral. 
It told of an old explorer who 
had gone down among the unsus- 
pecting natives to search their 
history for the first decisive spark 
of human civilization. Fighting a 
skeptical quarantine inspector no 
better conditioned than Scarlet 
himself, the explorer had pierced 
the lost past far enough to glimpse 
the birth of the human mind, the 
invention of the scientific method, 
and the laimching of the first 
neutrionic flyer. 

“That was — us!” Coral whis- 
pered, when he looked up from 
the tape. “This is our home planet; 
the people on that flyer were our 
forefathers. You can’t let any- 
body murder our mother race!” 

‘Tlease, Miss Fell!” Penwright 
reproved her with a hard bronze 



42 



GALAXY 



grin, and turned smoothly to the 
bench. “If Your Equity feel that 
we still have time for such enter- 
tainments, I have another exhibit 
to submit.” 

Scarlet glanced again at the 
empty doorway. 

“Very well,” he muttered. 

T he tape reported the case of a 
native who had been illegally 
removed from Earth for exhibi- 
tion in a galactic zoo. Inade- 
quately adjusted, even by savage 
standards, he had violently de- 
stroyed the expensive reconstruc- 
tion of his primitive habitat in 
which he had been displayed. 
Scarlet followed him to his fate 
with a reluctant and imcomfort- 
able "fascination, as if the uncon- 
ditioned anthropoid had also been 
himself. 

‘Well?” Pbnwright leered at 
Coral. “Are you sure you can 
make civilized men out of such 
untamable animals?” 

“That one was sick,” she pro- 
tested. “He was not typical.” 

“But what about this one?” 
Newbolt looked suddenly up from 
his wrist transceiver, glowering at 
the bench. “Your Equity, my 
monitors have just intercepted an 
electromagnetic signal from the 
savage rocket, beamed directly at 
this station. The sender appears 
as violent as that captive animal.” 
“Please translate the message.” 
“I shall. Your Equity.” 



Sound boomed into the dome, 
amplified through Newbolt’s wrist 
instrument. For a moment it was 
utterly strange; then Scarlet dis- 
tinguished a savage voice beneath 
the metallic distortion of the 
crude transmission system. In 
another moment, the psionic 
translator had given meaning to 
the roaring syllables. 

“United States Aerospace Force 
Rocket Ship Four One, Major 
Tom Scoggins in command, call- 
ing unidentified base on lunar 
equator.” 

Scarlet heard a tremor in the 
voice and a breath quickly drawn; 
he caught a vivid sensation of 
the frightened but determined 
savage in the rocket, fl 3 ung his 
crude craft toward a world un- 
known to him, crouching desper- 
ately over his battery of weapons, 
preparing to face hostility as vio- 
lent as his own. Even though the 
savage was completely imcondi- 
tioned. Scarlet felt a thrill of un- 
expected admiration. 

“Identify yourselves!” The 
strained voice rang again through 
the crackle of static. “Establish 
your friendly intentions at once. 
Otherwise we shall be forced to 
take action to insure the safety 
of the United States!” 

64 Vj^AIN, that’s our contact!” 
Coral’s voice lilted joy- 
ously. “You can tell that Major 
Tom Scoggins is desperately 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



43 



afraid, but this message proves 
that he is human. How can we 
wait?” 

“We — uh — we can’t.” Dis- 
turbed by a wave of unexpected 
emotion in himself, Scarlet turned 
uncertainly to Newbolt. “I — uh 
— I’m forced to instruct you to 
reply — ” 

“Your Equity!” 

The shout drew his eyes to the 
doorway. The dapper young Ve- 
gan banker came bursting into the 
dome, waving a sheaf of psionic 
documents. Sight of them turned 
Scarlet giddy. Here was his long 
dream realized. Here was his es- 
cape forever from all the wounds 
and sneers that he had suffered 
from the beautiful people, escape 
from their false sympathy and 
their shallow pretense that he 
could ever be one of them. Here 
was glorious revenge for his un- 
conditioned ugliness. He shut his 
eyes for an instant, trying to re- 
cover his mask of judicial sever- 
ity. 

“Your Equity!” The banker’s 
urgent voice seemed far away. 
“Captain Flintledge wishes me to 
present these new exhibits in evi- 
dence. We are confident that they 
will persuade you to recognize the 
contact, disapprove the blinker 
project and open Earth to galactic 
commerce.” 

Hands trembling. Scarlet ac- 
cepted the documents. Though 
his eyes were blurring, he quickly 



satisfied himself that they were 
what he had demanded — ^the neu- 
trionic flyer and a fair half of its 
load of trade goods and terraform- 
ing machinery, legally conveyed 
to him. 

“What kind of unconditioned 
aberration can delay your deci- 
sion now?” Newbolt’s contemptu- 
ous indignation reached him 
faintly. “May I remind Your 
Equity that our anthropoid at- 
tacker is already arming his 
fusion missiles?” 

“I — I’m aware of the facts.” 

Scarlet rose unsteadily, gasp- 
ing for his breath. The important 
facts were those in his hands. 
Even though his decision sacri- 
ficed one worn-out world, it would 
enable him to claim and colonize 
a hundred new ones when he 
reached the galactic frontier. For 
his own profit, perhaps; but also 
for the expanding community of 
human civilization. 

Such facts were all that mat- 
tered. But others kept buzzing in- 
sanely in his mind. Louder than 
Newbolt’s angry shout the earnest 
voice of the young savage Lenin 
echoed from the tape. The deci- 
sion of the shipwrecked prince 
flamed brighter than the moons 
in Coral’s hair. The breathless 
desperation of Major Tom Scog- 
gins was somehow suddenly his 
own. 

Stiffly, he gestured for silence 
in the chambers. 

GALAXY 



r 

I “I — uh — I have weighed the 

evidence.’’ 

Grinning at the splendid people 
waiting, he let his rodent teeth 
jut. He widened his yellow eyes. 
He was glad of his bent little body 
and the bulge of his low forehead 
and the red freckles splotched 
along his receeding jaw. Proud of 
all his unconditioned ugliness, he 
let them wait. 

“I have — uh — given due con- 
sideration to all the claims which 
have been presented here.” He let 
his slow voice rasp and whine 
offensively. “I have reviewed the 
Covenants of Non-Contact, and 
all the body of galactic law and 
custom relating to contact crises. 
I am ready — uh — to rule.” 
Snarling hideously, he let them 
wait again. 

“I rule that no contact exists!” 

^ORAL gasped indignantly. Old 
^ Whitherly swayed and fell. 
The banker bellowed. Newbolt 
and the signal officer shouted 
their startled approval. The up- 
roar drowned his voice. 

In the breathless hush that fol- 
lowed that surprised outburst, he 
let them wait again. He picked 
his pointed noise, deliberately 
savoring their pain. 

“The evidence convinces me 
that this native culture could not 
survive an uncontrolled contact.” 
Ignoring the baleful rage of the 
banker, he studied the smug ela- 



tion of Newbolt and Penwright, 
and paused again to relish what 
he meant to do to them. “How- 
ever, I am equally convinced that 
they are human beings.” 

He let his voice drag and grate. 

“Aware of my sworn duty un- 
der the Covenants, I therefore 
disapprove the signal project. I 
order Commander Newbolt and 
his successors to continue the 
quarantine of Earth until its 
native culture is declared ready 
for contact.” 

He stopped again to enjoy the 
sputtering deflation of the signal 
officer. 

“Pursuant to that directive, I 
order Newbolt to intercept the 
savage Tom Scoggins without 
needless injury to him or his 
crew. I suggest that they be en- 
listed in the quarantine service, 
as undercover agents acting to 
prevent any future expeditions 
from Earth into space.” 

“Why, Wain? Why?” Coral 
stared up at him, the blue flame 
pale and cold and flickering furi- 
ously around her. ‘Why have you 
done this?” 

He merely sriiiled at her with 
his offensive teeth, imtil she hissed 
and ran from the dome. Newbolt 
and the banker stalked after her. 
The signal officer turned to fol- 
low, but swimg abruptly back. 

“Your Equity?” His cold voice 
was ominous and slow. “May I 
ask why?” 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



44 



45 



“You have no right to ask.” 
Scarlet paused to survey the signs 
of strain that marred his bronze 
mask of calm perfection. “I don’t 
mind telling you, however, that I 
came here prepared to make a 
different decision. You yourself 
helped to change my first inten- 
tion, with the evidence you of- 
fered about the people of Earth. 
Even the stories of their imper- 
fections helped to persuade me 
that they are as human as I am. 
You seem surprised by my ruling. 
Perhaps I am, too. Surprised — 
and pleased!” 

Penwright was no longer listen- 
ing. His wrist screen had flashed. 
He scanned it, whispering. When 
at last he looked up again at Scar- 
let, his bronze mask was beauti- 
ful again. 

“Your Ekiuity,” he murmured 
gently, “I have another surprise 
for you. I believe it means that 
your astonishing verdict will soon 
be reversed by a higher authority, 
in favor of our signal project.” 

“Careful!” Scarlet rapped. 
“You’ll find yourself in con- 
tempt.” 

“I am in contempt.” Penwright 
nodded serenely. “I can be candid 
about that, because we have just 
received a message from a pas- 
senger on another incoming serv- 
ice flyer. He’s an old associate of 
yours, from the quarantine office 
on Denebola IV. Remember War- 
den Thomwall?” 



“Why is he here?” 

“There’s something in your 
past.” Penwright chuckled dis- 
creetly. “Some tampering with 
official records. Somebody dis- 
covered that you were inade- 
quately conditioned for your mis- 
sion here. The regional director 
sent Thomwall to replace you.” 

S CARLET stood staring blank- 
ly, speechless, with all his 
new resolutions shattering into 
panic. Following too close to the 
limiting velocity of light, his past- 
had overtaken him. His gesture of 
help toward the people of Earth 
had cost him everything. 

“Thomwall is an old school 
friend of mine.” Penwright glowed 
with reminiscent pleasure. “Once 
I saved his life, when we were sun- 
diving after the flying lights and 
he had got himself trapped in one 
of their magnetic nests. I think I 
can tmst him to approve the 
blinker project.” 

“Perhaps he will,” Scarlet 
rasped. “When he arrives!” 

Still robed defiantly in his ju- 
dicial light, he abandoned the 
bench and darted down to Mark 
Whitherly, who sat like a white 
and silent mummy wrapped in 
rhill gray dust, alive only in his 
bright and bitter eyes. 

“Where is Coral?” Scarlet 
shouted. “Where did she go?” 

“Do you know what you have 
done?” The fading wisp of 



46 



GALAXY 



Whitherly ignored his own hoarse 
demand. “With your imcondi- 
tioned blindness, you have killed 
jny great chance to observe a 
contact crisis. You have killed me. 
I am asking for euthanasia.” 

“I’ll approve it gladly,” Scarlet 
snarled. “But what became of 
Coral Fell?” 

“You will find her with Flint- 
ledge,” Whitherly whispered 
through the frosty dust. “If you 
find her at all!” 

Feeling as cold and futile as the 
dying scientist. Scarlet mshed 
from the dome to the surface 
level. When he burst out of the 
lock tower in a space belt, Sol 
was already rising over the bleak 
moonscape. 

But how could it be Sol? 

Bewilderment froze him. 

That blinding point of hot blue 
light was too small for Sol, rising 
too far north and three days early. 
Perhaps it was another star! 

But he had no time for riddles 
now. Setting the belt to filter out 
its burning glare, he ran on to 
search for his neutrionic flyer. 

Perhaps, he supposed, Newbolt 
had been panicked into an un- 
duly violent interception of the 
rocket from Earth. Perhaps Tom 
Scoggins’s fusion missiles had 
been detonated. But then, if that 
were true, the fire in space should 
have been fading. 

Instead, it was visibly growing. 
He had to turn his filters up again. 



Although the savage blaze hid the 
constellations, he thought it must 
be in the direction of Denebola. 
It must be — 

An artificial nova! 

That jolted him. Even since he 
knew Penwright, the demolition 
of a star seemed incredible inso- 
lence. But he caught his breath 
and hurried on. 

Which star had the signalmen 
chosen to bum for the first inter- 
galactic flash? 

VIII 

He found the Vegan banker vm- 
happily surveying a gray crater 
of deflated camouflage fabric 
around the empty pad where the 
neutrionic flyer had stood. Shiver- 
ing with a sense of chill desola- 
tion, he whispered hoarsely: 
“Coral? Have you seen her?” 
“Gone with Flintledge.” The 
banker waved stiffly at the blaz- 
ing sky. “Gone out where you 
yourself were planning to go.” 
Scarlet recovered his breath 
and buried his dreams. He offered 
mechanically at last to surrender 
the documents that had made 
him legal owner of the flyer. 

“Worthless waste tape!” The 
banker laughed. “Riding the neu- 
trionic wind from that new nova, 
the flyer will come close enough 
to the speed of light. Flintledge 
and Coral can’t be overtaken. 
They can choose their own worlds 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



47 



to civilize, out on the galactic 
frontier — wherever it is when 
they overtake it.” 

“I can’t understand it.” Scarlet 
stood scowling with a puzzled in- 
dignation. “What had Coral in 
common with that monster?” 

“Enough.” The banker grinned. 
“They were both searching for 
more primitive creatures to ex- 
ploit, each in his own way. They 
found each other. But I believe 
Your Equity has more urgent 
problems now.” A raw edge of 
malice cut through the Vegan’s 
well-conditioned courtesy. “Al- 
though I am in no position to 
press any charges against you, I 
was pleased to learn that Com- 
mander Newbolt has ordered 
your arrest.” 

“I’m immune from arrest,” 
Scarlet muttered desperately. “So 
long as I wear my light of office.” 

“You won’t wear it long,” the 
banker promised unpleasantly. 
‘Warden Thornwall will soon be 
landing, with all the unfortunate 
facts you thought you had buried 
on Denebola IV.” 

CTILL clinging grimly to the 
^ pale halo of his authority. 
Scarlet was waiting with Newbolt 
and Penwright and the banker 
when the arriving quarantine flyer 
came down out of the savage glare 
of the nova. Newbolt marched 
quickly to meet Thornwall at the 
lock. 



“Here’s your man, sir.” He 
nodded contemptuously toward 
Scarlet. “I attempted to arrest 
him. But he has the face to claim 
judicial immunity.” 

“Hello, Wain!” Thornwall 
looked older, his dark beauty 
oddly dulled, as if the long light- 
years had somehow overtaken 
him. Yet his worn smile seemed 
strangely benign. He walked past 
Newbolt, in order to grasp Scar- 
let’s hand. 

“Forgive my bringing up your 
past sins.” Oddly, he was grin- 
ning. “When I sent the message, 
I understood from Newbolt that 
you were about to make a more 
serious sort of blunder. Fortun- 
ately, your ruling on the crisis 
here was a magnificent vindica- 
tion.” 

“What’s all this?” Newbolt fol- 
lowed from the lock, glaring furi- 
ously. ‘Warden Thornwall, aren’t 
you going to nullify the decisions 
of this criminal?” 

“On the contrary.” A stem 
smile flickered through the 
shadow on Thornwall’s face. 
“Commander, I am afraid that 
you have forgotten one of the 
first traditions of the service. We 
allow our people to learn from 
their mistakes. Although Scarlet 
was not aware of it, his uncondi- 
tioned behavior back on Denebola 
IV was observed and reported at 
the time. The regional director 
offered me a bet that he would 



48 



GALAXY 



make the right decision, before 
we sent him here.” 

Scarlet blinked his yellow eyes. 

“But if — if you know what I 
have done, aren’t you going to 
break me?” 

“Don’t be an utterly uncondi- 
tioned fool!” Thornwall clapped 
him warmly on the back. “I re- 
fused to accept that bet. We’re 
few of us perfect. And those few 
are seldom successful in the serv- 
ice, because they share too little 
with the people we guard. Wain, 
I’m going to recommend you for 
promotion.” 

Scarlet gulped and tried to 
wet his quivering lips. 

“But he ought to be cashiered!” 
Newbolt stormed. “I can prove 
that he accepted a bribe. His de- 
cision to extend the quarantine 
ignored comp>etent evidence that 
Earth is not human. I will advise 
the signal service to appeal!” 

“Your advice will carry little 
weight,” Thornwall softly inter- 
mpted him. “Because you have 
been relieved of your duties here. 
You are being reassigned to the 
signal service — which is now 
facing an extraordinary emer- 
gency.” 

Ignoring Newbolt’s indignant 
roar, Thornwall turned briskly 
back to Scarlet. 

“Wain, you are replacing New- 
bolt as commander of the station 
here. For the next few centuries, 
you will be shepherding the 



people of Earth along toward 
tmly human status. That will be 
a difficult and lonely task, which 
you can hope to accomplish only 
by making the best use of subor- 
dinates who are no better condi- 
tioned than you are.” 

Newbolt had moved apart, 
muttering with Penwright. 

‘We won’t take this!” he 
shouted suddenly. “The blinker 
project must be accelerated now, 
to integrate this natural nova into 
our intergalactic signal. The con- 
demnation of the planets of Sol 
was supported by adequate evi- 
dence, which Scarlet chose to ig- 
nore. The signal service is going to 
appeal to your regional head- 
quarters on Denebola IV!” 

Thornwall’s worn smile 
checked him. 

“We no longer have any head- 
quarters on Denebola IV.” He 
nodded soberly toward that ter- 
rible new luminary blazing over 
the blue moonscape. “Because 
that nova is Denebola.” 
“Denebola — a nova?” 

“But not a natural nova.” 

T^EWBOLT gasped and stared 
’ at Penwright. 

“It can’t — ” Violently, the sig- 
nal officer shook his head. “It 
can’t be artificial! Sol was to be 
the first. Denebola is no part of 
our signal project.” 

“Not of yours,” Thornwall said. 
“But there is another.” 



A PLANET FOR PLUNDERING 



49 



“Whose — ?” 

“Interpreting the signal will be 
part of your duty now.” Thorn- 
wall smiled bleakly. “I had my 
first hint of the thing years ago, 
when I was sun-diving in Dene- 
bola, investigating the radiations 
of the energy complexes that we 
used to call the flying lights. On 
several occasions, I detected neu- 
trionic components in their emis- 
sions. 

“Since, I have been gathering 
the reports of other expeditions 
into other stars. Several divers 
have detected focused neutrionic 
beams, of the same type that you 
meant to use to ignite your own 
supernovas. A mass flight of the 
lights from the surface of Dene- 
bola, which I observed not long 
before I left, led me to suspect 
that our galactic civilization is 
just reaching contact with another 
culture more highly advanced 
than we can easily imagine.” 

Thomwall chuckled at Pen- 
wright’s pale amazement. 

“I should imagine that your 
blinker project will have to be 
abandoned now.” The flicker of 
amusement faded from his voice. 



“Because these electronic beings 
have apparently selected the suns 
for their signal project with no 
more regard for us than you had 
for the anthropoids of Earth. I 
doubt that Denebola will be the 
last of their synthetic supernovas 
— unless you can persuade them 
to grant us status in their culture.” 

“How — how can we hope to 
do that?” 

“It’s your crisis now.” 

Scarlet turned slowly away 
from Penwright’s hoarse con- 
sternation. He glanced into the 
burning sky, wondering which 
direction Coral and the trader had 
taken. 

Then his mind came quickly 
back to the more important prob- 
lem. He would have to return 
Major Tom Scoggins to Earth 
with a warning for the natives — 
tell them that the radiation from 
the nova would force a halt to all 
their plans for the exploration of 
space. 

Then — to shepherd its people 
through the years of growth — un- 
til Earth could rejoin its proud, 
prodigal children!

Not all aliens come from distant

— and our very homes are theirs!

The 

Tall- Tied 



Kings 

E brought Them water, 
one by one. 

“The water is sweet, 
One-Eye,” said a Mother. “Very 
sweet.” 

“Many bring Us water,” a 
second Mother said, “but the 
water you bring is sweet.” 

“Because his breath is sweet,” 
said a third Mother. 

The One-Eye paused, about to 
leave. “I would tell you of a good 
thing,” a Father said, “which none 
others know, only We. I may tell 
him, softly, in his ear, may I not?” 
In his comer. Keeper stirred. A 
Mother and a Father raised their 
voices. “It is colder now,” They 
said. “Outside: frost. A white thing 
on the ground, and burns. We 



have heard. Frost.” Keeper 
grunted, did not move. “Colder, 
less food, less water. We have 
heard, but for Us always food, al- 
ways water, water, food, food . .” 
They went on. Keeper did not 
move. 

“Come closer,” said the Father, 
softly. “I will tell you of a good 
thing, while Keeper sleeps.” The 
Father’s voice was deep and rich. 
“Come to my mouth. A secret 
thing. One-Eye.” 

“I may not come. Father,” said 
the One-Eye, imcertainly. “Only 
to bring water.” 

“You may come,” said a 
Mother. Her voice was like milk, 
her voice was good. “Your breath 
is sweet. Come, listen. Come.” 




THE TAIL-TIED KINGS

Another Father said, “You will 
be cold, alone. Come among Us 
OTd be warm.” The One-Eye 
moved his head from side to side, 
and he muttered. 

“There is food here and you 
will eat,” the other Father said. 
The One-Eye moved a few steps, 
then hesitated. 

“Come and mate with me,” said 
the milk-voiced Mother. “It is my 
time. Come.” 

The One-Eye perceived that it 
was indeed her time and he 
darted forward, but the Keeper 
blocked his way. 

“Go, bring water for Them to 
drink,” said Keeper. He was huge. 

“He has water for Us now,” a 
Mother said, plaintively. “Stupid 
Keeper. We are thirsty. Why do 
you stop him?” 

A Father said, “He has water 
in his mouth which he has brought 
for Us. Step aside and let him 
pass. Oh, it is an ugly, stupid 
Keeper!” 

“I have water in my mouth 
which I have brought for Them,” 
the One-Eye said. “Step aside and 
— ” He stopped, as they burst into 
jeers and titters. 

The Keeper was not even 
angry. “There was nothing in 
your mouth but a lie. Now, go.” 

Too late, the One-Eye per- 
ceived his mistake. “I may sleep,” 
he muttered. 

“Sleep, then. But go.” Keeper 
bared his teeth. The One-Eye 



shrank back, and turned and 
slunk away. Behind him he heard 
the Mother in her milk-voice say, 
“It was a stupid One-Eye, 
Father.” 

“And now,” the Father said. 
The One-Eye heard their mating 
as he went 

S ometimes he had tried to 

run away, but- 'eversrwhere 
there were others who stopped 
him. “It is a One-Eye, and too far 
away. Go to your place, One-Eye. 
Go to your duty, bring water for 
the Mothers and Fathers, take 
Their food to the Keeper, go back, 
go back, One-Eye, go back,” they 
cried, surrounding him, driving 
him from the way he would go. 

“I will not be a One-Eye any 
longer,” he protested. 

They jeered and mocked. 
“Will you grow another eye, then? 
Back, back; it is The Race which 
orders you!” And they had nipped 
him and forced him back. 

Once, he had said, “I will see 
the goldshining!” 

There was an old one who said, 
“Return, then, One-Eye and I will 
show you the goldshining on the 
way.” And the old one lifted a 
round thing and it glittered gold. 
He cried out with surprise and 
pleasure. 

Then, “I thought it would be 
bigger,” he said. 

“Return, One-Eye, or you will 
be killed,” the old one said. “Out- 



52 



GALAXY 



side is not for you. Return . Not 
that way! That way is a death 
thing. Mark it well. This way. Go. 
And be quick — there may be 
dogs.” 

There was some times a new 
one to instruct, blood wet in the 
socket, at the place of water, to 
drink his fill and then fill his 
mouth and go to the Fathers and 
Mothers, not to swallow a drop, 
to learn the long way and the 
turnings, down and down in the 
darkness, past the Keeper, mouth 
to mouth to the Fathers and 
Mothers. Again and again. 

“Why are They bound?” a new 
one asked. 

“Why are we half-blinded? It is 
The Race which orders. It is The 
Race which collects the food that 
other One-Eyes bring to Keeper, 
and he stores it and feeds Them.” 

‘Why?” 

They paused, water dripping 
from above into the pool. Why? 
To eat and drink must be or else 
death. But why does The Race 
order Fathers and Mothers to be 
bound so that they cannot find 
their own food and water? “I am 
only a stupid One-Eye. But I 
think the Fathers and Mothers 
would tell me . There was men- 
tion of a' secret thing . The 
Keeper would not let me listen 
after that ...” 

“That is a big Keeper, and his 
teeth are sharp!” 

Water fell in gouts from over- 

THE TAIL-TIED KINGS 



head and splashed into the pool. 
They filled their mouths and 
started down. When he had emp)- 
tied the last drop in his mouth he 
whispered, “Mother, I would hear 
the secret thing.” 

She stiffened. Then she 
clutched at him. The other 
Fathers and Mothers ceased 
speaking and moving. At the 
entrance ^e Keeper sat up. 
‘What is it?” he called. There was 
alarm in his voice, and it quav- 
ered. 

“A strange sound,” said a 
Father. “Keeper, listen!” Then — 
“Slaves?” he whispered. 

The Keeper moved his head 
from side to side. The Fathers 
and Mothers were all quite still. 
“I hear nothing,” Keeper said, un- 
certainly. 

“Keeper, you are old, your 
senses are dulled,” the deep- 
voiced Father said. ‘We say there 
is a strange noise! There is dan- 
ger! Go and see — go now!” 

The Keeper became agitated. 
“I may not leave,” he protested. 
“It is The Race which orders me 
to stay here — ” 

Fathers and Mothers together 
cried out at him. “The Race! The 
Race! We are The Race! Go and 
find out the danger to Us!” 

“The One-Eye — ^where is the 
One-Eye? I will send him!” But 
they cried that the One-Eye had 
left (as, indeed, one of them had), 
and so, finally, gibbering and mut- 

53 




tering, he lumbered up the pas- 
sageway. 

As soon as he had left, the milk- 
voiced Mother began to caress 
and stroke the One-Eye, saying 
that he'Was clever and good, that 
his breath was sweet, that — 

“There is no time for that. 
Mother,” she was interrupted. 
“Tell him the secret. Quick! 
Quick!” 

“Before you were made a One- 
Eye and were set apart to serve 
Us, with whom did you first 
mate?” she asked. 

“With the sisters in my own 
litter, of course.” 

“Of course .... for they were 
nearest. And after that, with the 
mother of your own litter. Your 
sire was perhaps an older brother. 
After that you would have mated 
with daughters, with aunts . .” 

“Of course.” 

The Mother asked if he did not 
know that this incessant inbreed- 
ing could eventually weaken The 
Race. 

“I did not know.” 

She lifted her head, listened. 
“The stupid Keeper is not return- 
ing yet. Good ... It is so, One-Eye. 
Blindness, deafness, deformation, 
aborting, madness, still-births. All 
these occur from time to time in 
every litter. And when flaw mates 
with flaw and no new blood 
enters the line. The Race weak- 
ens. Is it not so. Fathers and 
Mothers?” 



They answered, “Mother, it is 
so.” 

The One-Eye asked, “Is this, 
then, the secret? A Father told 
me that the secret was a good 
thing, and this is a bad thing.” 

Be silent. They told him, and 
listen. 

In her milk-rich voice the 
Mother went on, “But We are not 
bom of the same litter. We are 
not sib, not even near kin. From 
time to time there is a choosing 
made of the strongest and clever- 
est of many litters. And out of 
these further selections. And then 
a final choosing — eight, perhaps, 
or ten, or twelve. With two, or at 
most, three males to be Fathers, 
and the rest females. And these, 
the chosen of the best of the 
young, are taken to a place very 
far from the outside, very safe 
from danger, and a Keeper set to 
guard them, and One-Eyes set 
apart to bring them food and 
Water . .” 

A Father continued the story. 
“It is of Ourselves that We are 
talking. They bound Us together, 
tied Us tightly with many knots, 
tail to tail together, so that it was 
impossible to mn away. We had 
no need to face danger above, no 
need to forage. We had only to 
eat, to drink, to grow strong — and 
you see that we are far larger 
than you — and to mate. All this 
as The Race has ordered.” 

“I see ... I did not know. This 



54 



GALAXY 



is a good thing, yes. It is wise.” 
The Mothers and Fathers cried 
out at this. “It is not good!” They 
declared. “It is not wise! It is not 
right! To bind Us together when 
We were young and unknowing 
was well, yes. But to keep Us 
bound now is not well. We, too, 
would walk freely about! We 
would see the goldshining and the 
slaves, not to stay bound in the 
dimness here!” 

“One-Eye!” They cried. “You 
were set apart to serve Us — ” 
“Yes,” he muttered. “I will 
bring water.” 

But this was not what They 
wanted of him. “One-Eye,” They 
whispered, “good, handsome, 
clever, yoimg, sweet-breathed 
One-Eye. Set Us free! Unloose the 
knots! We cannot reach them, you 
can reach them — ” 

He protested. “I dare not!” 
Their voices rose angrily. “You 
must! It is The Race which or- 
ders! We would rule and We will 
rule and you will rule with Us!” 
"... mate with Us!” In his ear, 
a Mother’s voice. He shivered. 

Again, they spoke in whispers, 
hissing. “See, One-Eye, you must 
know where there are death 
places and food set out which 
must not be eaten. Bring such 
food here, set it down. We will 
know. We will see that Keeper 
eats it, when he returns. Then, 
One-Eye, then — ” 

Suddenly, silence. 

THE TAIL-TIED KINGS 



All heads were raised. 

A Father’s deep voice was shrill 
with fear. “That is smoke!” 

But another Father said, “The 
Race will see that no harm comes 
to Us.” And the others all re- 
peated his assurance. They moved 
to and fro, in Their odd, circum- 
scribed way, a few paces to each 
side, and around, and over each 
other, and back. They were wait- 
ing. 

It seemed to the One-Eye that 
the smoke grew thicker. And a 
Mother said, “While We wait, let 
Us listen for Keeper and for the 
steps of those The Race will send 
to rescue Us. Meanwhile, you, 
One-Eye, try the knots. Test the 
knots, see if you can set Us free.” 

“What is this talk of ‘try’ and 
‘test’ and ‘see’?” a Father then 
demanded. “He has only to act 
and it is done! Have We not dis- 
cussed this amongst Ourselves, al- 
ways, always? Are We not 
agreed?” 

A second Mother said, “It is so. 
The One-Eye has freedom, full 
freedom of movement, while We 
have not; he can reach the knots 
and We can not. Come, One-Eye. 
Act. And while you set Us free. 
We will listen, and when We are 
free, We will not need to wait 
longer for Keeper and the others. 
Why do they not come?” she 
concluded, querulous and uncer- 
tain. 

And they cried to him to untie 



55 



Them, set Them free, and great 
things would be his with Them; 
and, “If not,” They shrilled, “We 
will kill you!” 

They pushed him off and 
ordered him to begin. The smell 
of the smoke was strong. 

Presently he said, “I can do 
nothing. The knots are too tight.” 

“We will kill you!” they clam- 
ored. “It is not so! We are agreed 
it is not!” And again and again he 
tried, but could do nothing. 

“Listen, Mothers and Fathers,” 
the milk-voiced one said. “There 
is not time. No one comes. The 
Race has abandoned Us. There 
must be danger to them; rather 
than risk, they will let Us die and 
then they will make another 
choosing for new Mothers and 
Fathers.” 

Silence. They listened, strained, 
snuffed the heavy air. 

Then, screaming, terrified, the 
others leaped up, fell back, tum- 
bling over each other. A Mother’s 
voice — soft, warm, rich, sweet — 
spoke. “There is one thing alone. 
Since the knots will not loose, 
they must be severed. One-Eye! 
Your teeth. Quickly! Now!” 

The others crouched and 
cringed, panting. The One-Eye 
sank his teeth into the living knot, 
and, instantly a Father screamed 
and lunged forward, cried stop. 

“That is pain!” he whimpered. 
“I have not felt pain before, I can- 
not bear it. Keeper will come, the 



others will save Us, The Race — ” 

And none would listen to the 
Mother. 

“Mother, I am afraid,” the One- 
Eye said. “The smoke is thicker.” 

“Go, then, save yourself,” she 
said. 

“I will not leave without you.” 

“I? I am part of the whole. Go. 
Save yourself.” 

But still he would not, and 
again he crept *up to her. 

They came at last to the end 
of the passage. They could not 
count the full number of the dead. 
The smoke was gone now. The 
Mother clung to him with her fore 
limbs. Her hind limbs dragged. 
She was weak, weak from the un- 
accustomed labor of walking, 
weak from the trail of thick, red 
blood she left behind from the 
wound which set her free. 

“Is this outside?” she asked. 

“I think so. Yes, it must be. See! 
Overhead — the goldshining! The 
rest I do not know,” the One-Eye 
answered. 

“So that is the goldshining. I 
have heard — Yes, and the rest, 
I have heard, too. Those are the 
houses of the slaves and there are 
the fields the slaves tend, and 
from which they make the food 
which they store up for Us. Come, 
help me, for I must go slowly; and 
we will find a place for Us. We 
will mate, for We are now The 
Race.” Her voice was like milk. 
“And our numbers will not end.” 



56 



GALAXY 



He said, “Yes, Mother. Our 
numbers will not end.” 

With his single eye he scanned 
i Outside — ^the Upper World of the 

; slaves who thought themselves 
masters, who, with trap and ter- 
rier and ferret and poison and 
smoke, warred incessantly against 
The Race. Did they think that 
even this great slaughter was vic- 



tory? If so, they were deceived. 
It had only been a skirmish. 

The slaves were slaves still; the 
tail-tied ones were kings. 

“Come, Mother,” he said. And, 
slowly and painfully, and with 
absolute certainty, he and his new 
mate set out to take possession of 
the world.

S O HELP me, I’m not really 
a fiend, a monstrous mur- 
derer or a Bluebeard. I am 
not, truly, even a mad scientist 
bucking for a billing to top Frank- 
enstein’s. My knowledge of sci- 
ence ends with the Sunday mag- 
azine section of the paper. As for 
the bodies of all those women 
the front pages claim I butchered 
and buried somewhat carelessly 
out by the garage, all that is just 
— well, just an illusion of sorts. 

Equally illusory, I am hoping, 
is my reservation for a sure seat, 
next performance, in the electric 
chair which now seems so. certain 
after the merest formality of a 
trial. 

Actually I am, or was, nothing 
but a very normal, average — 
upper middle average, that is — 
sort of a guy. I have always been 
friendly, sociable, kindly, lovable 
to a fault. So how did lovable, 
kindly old I happen to get into 
such a bloody mess? 

I simply helped a little old 
lady cross the street. That’s all. 

All right, I admit I was old for 
Boy Scout work. But the poor 
old bat did look mighty confused 
and baffled, standing there on the 
corner of York and Grand Ave- 
nue, looking vaguely around. 

So, “What the hell,” I said to 
myself; and, to her, “Can I help 



58 



GALAXY 



you, Madam?” I had to cross the 
street anyway. Traffic being what 
it was, I figured I’d feel a little 
safer with her for company. It 
was silly, of course, to think that 
a poor old lady on my arm would 
ever inhibit the Grand Avenue 
traffic but I tried it. 



Good job I did, too. 

It was an early fall afternoon, 
a bit before rush hour. I had 
knocked off work early. It was too 
nice a day for work and besides 
the managing editor had fired me 
again. I had nothing better to 
doj so I thought I’d wander over 
to Maxim’s for a drink or two. 
Then, on the corner, I found the 
old lady. 

She was a pretty sad-looking 
old lady. Matter of fact she was 
— just standing there, not even 
trying — the worst-looking old 
lady I ever saw. She looked, to 
put it kindly, like a three-day 
corpse that had made it the hard 
way after a century of poor 
health. First I thought, hell, I’ll 
give the old bag of misery a 
boost, shove her under a bus or 
something. It would be the de- 
cent, kindly thing to do. 

I spoke, tentatively. She half- 
turned and looked up at me from 
her witch’s crouch. The eyes in 
the beak-nosed, ravaged ruin of 
a face were big, luminous, a glow- 
ing green. They clearly belonged 
elsewhere and there was a 
lost, appealing look in them. 



There was a demand there, too. 

“I — uh — that is, would you 
care to cross with me. Madam?” 
I asked her. 

She took my arm. There was a 
moment’s lull in the wake of a 
screaming prowl car. I muttered 
a word of prayer and we were off 
the curb. The old hag was sur- 
prisingly quick. It looked as 
though we were going to make it. 
Then, three-quarters across, I 
came down with a rubber heel in 
an oil slick just as a roaring, 
grinding cement-mixer truck was 
coming down on me like an ava- 
lanche. My feet went up. I gave 
the old witch a shove clear and 
shut my eyes for fear the coming 
sight of smeared blood and guts 
— my own — would make me 
sick. 

A ND then, instead of a prone, 
cringing heap on the pave- 
ment sweating out the ten-to-one 
odds against all those wheels 
missing me, I was airborne. Cable- 
strong arms caught and lifted me. 
We were racing down field, elu- 
sive, unstoppable, all the way — 
touchdown. 

So there we were, safe on the 
sidewalk. Traffic on the freeway, 
gaping at us, was chaos as the 
frail, doddering little old lady put 
me down. Me, I was never any 
extra large size. But still, a touch 
under six feet, maybe a little too 
friendly with beer and rich des- 



STAR-CROSSED LOVER

serts — say, 210 pounds — I 
had considered myself a little big 
for convenient carrying about. 

This was something new in 
little old ladies. 

I stared down at her. She 
wasn’t even breathing hard. In 
fact I couldn’t tell if she was 
breathing at all. “Madam,” I 
said, “my sincere thanks and ad- 
miration. I wonder now. If you’re 
not late for practice with the 
Bears or something, perhaps we 
could go someplace and talk?” 
I couldn’t guess what, but there 
was for sure some sort of a story 
here. If I could get something hot 
for the Sunday magazine, I’d have 
my job back. 

The old crone looked up at me 
with those oddly out of place, 
compelling eyes of hers. “You will 
listen to me? You will help?” 

“Madam, help you don’t need. 
But listen, yes. This is my great 
talent. I will be happy to listen 
to you.” 

I thought a quiet booth and a 
couple of cold ones in Maxim’s 
would be nice. No. She wondered 
in a different, quavering old 
voice, if greater privacy might 
not be better. “What I have to 
tell you, young man, may be dif- 
ficult for you to grasp. It may 
be necessary to show you some 
things.” 

“Uh.” She wasn’t the type of 
doll I favored taking home for 
a sociable evening but it wouldn’t 



have seemed mannerly to say no 
to the look of appeal in her eyes. 
“All right.” 

We went on over to the park- 
ing lot and I drove her to the 
very comfortable home out in 
Oakdale that Uncle John and 
Aunt Belle turned over to me 
when they rolled off to see the 
world from their house trailer a 
year and a half back. Of course 
they dropped anchor in Peters- 
burg and haven’t budged since, 
but I guess it gives them the 
footloose feeling they were look- 
ing for. And I have the house, 
which is quite a pleasant little 
place. 

I think Aunt Belle figured giv- 
ing me the house would offset my 
own dubious attributes so that 
some nice girl might just possibly 
marry and make something of me. 
But I kept a picture on my 
bureau of Uncle John, standing 
by the sink in his apron, and was 
still holding out. 

Well, the old bat didn’t clue 
me in on anything on the drive 
out there in my car. We chatted 
along the way, mostly her asking 
the questions, me answering. She 
was just a visitor to the town, she 
said. She wanted to find out all 
about it — with ten thousand 
nonsensical questions. 

I parked in the drive and we 
went in. While she settled down 
on the sofa I went to the bar, my 
addition to the, home furnishings.

to fix ® drink; wondered if there 
flight still be any tea knocking 
around; thought better of that 
and mixed two drinks. Then I 
turned back toward her. 

“Now,” I said, “tell me.” 

“Well,” announced that ravaged 
wreck of an old woman, “the fact 
is that I am from another world.” 

“Oh, hell,” I said, “how did you 
come in? By saucer or by 
broom?” It was a mean remark, I 
suppose. Not kindly. Even so, the 
way she took it seemed all out 
of proportion. The old bat’s face 
suddenly went slack. She 
slumped over sideways on the 
sofa, those big, green eyes open, 
staring, empty. There was no 
need to go check for a pulse or 
heartbeat. She was plainly, re- 
voltingly dead. 

“Ugh!” I said and tossed off 
one of the two drinks I was hold- 
ing. It seemed the thing to do. 

6irio not be alarmed,” said 
an apparent voice. “I am 
really perfectly all right. I have 
simply left that poor vehicle I 
was using. I had thought, wrongly 
it now seems, that communication 
with you chemically powered life 
forms might be easier if I too 
were concealed within one such 
structure.” 

The voice actually wasn’t so 
much a voice as a voice impres- 
sion. It came from a point in the 
air above the body on the sofa. 



And it did make an impression. 
It came through in a rush of 
meanings, too loud somehow, al- 
most overpowering. 

I looked toward the point of 
origin. That’s what it was, as near 
as anything, a tiny pinpoint of 
intense, green-gold light. It was 
too intense; I had to turn my eyes 
away. My head started to ache. 
I felt and knew that, whatever 
species this might be, my visitor 
was a female of it. She was, at 
the moment, horribly overbear- 
ing. She was communicating ef- 
fectively, enthusiastically, but un- 
clearly and it wasn’t easy. Not on 
me, anyway. My mind was 
swamped with a mass of con- 
cepts, jabber and ideas, like all 
the women’s clubs of the world 
talking at once. 

I groaned and staggered back 
against the bar. “All right,” I 
yelled, “all right, I believe you. 
You come from another world. 
You are an amazing, wonderful 
girl and I am proud to entertain 
you. But please — go back to 
being an old woman, or some- 
thing I can handle.” 

The ravaged old crone’s eyes 
glowed again. She blinked and 
sat up. “Please don’t shout so. I 
can hear you,” she remarked 
primly. 

I drained the other drink and 
put both glasses back on the bar. 
“Ugh. Uh, that’s better. But who 
— where — what — ?”

“Please do stop and think a 
minute,” the old witch told me. 
“If you will simply use that elec- 
tro-chemical mental equipment 
of yours, you will find that I 
have already given you the 
answers to those questions about 
who and what I am and where I 
come from.” 

“Nonsense.” But then it came 
to me that she had. I just hadn’t 
taken time to sort any of it out. 

I tried sorting. Much of it re- 
mained fuzzy, I suppose because 
some aspects were so far outside 
the range of anything known to 
me. She was, the way I got it, a 
life form based on something ap- 
proximating atomic energy. She 
came from a dwarf star out some- 
place, I couldn’t quite place it, 
out Orion way I think. Sure, the 
entire concept was beyond me 
and completely alien. And yet, 
oddly, in a lot of ways it was 
like old home week. This was a 
kind of life totally different from 
ours in all structure and develop- 
ment; and yet their kind of 
thought, their relationship to their 
world and their social organiza- 
tion, seemed weirdly familiar. 
They had work, recreation, social 
organization. They reproduced 
by some sort of polarity business 
I didn’t get then and still don’t; 
but it required mating and it cer- 
tainly seemed a fair approxima- 
tion of sex. 

They had arts based on forms 



and shaped patterns of energy. 
I don’t get it. She said it • com- 
pared to our literature, music and 
painting and I take her work for 
it. “Only,” as she later explained 
a touch wistfully, “terribly, ter- 
ribly decadent in the present 
era.” * 

T here was their problem. 

Their social structure and 
individuals alike seemed, at last, 
to be losing all vitality. The birth 
rate dropped. Culture declined. 
They had, fairly recently by their 
standards, discovered the possi- 
bility of freeing themselves from 
their sun and travelling through 
space. But, while they found 
planets with chemical life forms 
like us not uncommon in space, 
they had found no form compar- 
able to their own. Outside con- 
tacts, they had thought, might 
stimulate and revitalize their so- 
ciety. But, of course, where there 
is life there is politics. They had 
developed many and bitter dif- 
ferences of opinion regarding the 
feasibility or value of any attempt 
to communicate with chemical 
life forms. There was a party for, 
a party against and several fa- 
voring an agonizing reappraisal of 
the position whatever it might 
turn out to be. Nothing was done. 
And that, in due course, had 
brought me my lone lady visitor. 

The “communication” party de- 
cided to take action in spite of 



r the absence of official sanction. 
They worked cautiously, in se- 
cret. Specially selected represent- 
I atives with certain exceptional 

> kinds and degrees of sensitivity 

I ^ere made ready. Necessary en- 
ergy supplies for distant space 
travel were carefully hoarded. 
Chances of anything coming of 
I it were considered slim but . 

I there was the horrible old hag 

sitting on my sofa, looking hope- 
fully up at me out of great, 
I youthfully glowing green eyes. 

I Anyway, that’s the way the 
r thing shaped up in my mind. And 
it seemed plenty hard to believe. 

“Must I come out and show 
you again?” 

“No,” I said quickly. “Oh, no, 
please don’t. I’m convinced.” 

“Or will be,” she remarked 
cryptically. “Good. This now 

( proves that at least one level of 
communication between us is 
possible. This is promising. It 
could mark the beginning of a 
relationship which may be most 
stimulating for both life forms.” 
Well, it was startling at least, 
I would have to admit that. 
I “Speaking of forms,” I said, “You 
I sure picked an ugly one there. 
Why?” 

“Oh? But I am only now begin- 
ning to understand your stand- 
ards of attraction. I took this 
structure — ” she pwinted one 
gnarled, knotty hand at herself 
— “because in my own form no 



one seemed willing to listen or 
accept me logically. They only 
yelled that I was an A-bomb or 
a short circuit or lightning, or 
else simply pretended they didn’t 
see me at all. So I took this body, 
making only a few small internal 
repairs and improvements. But 
then, until you came along, no 
one would stop long enough to 
listen to me.” 

“Hum. Where’d you get it?” 

“I picked it up at one of your 
places for them to die. What you 
call the cold room at the County 
Hospital. There was, I admit, 
some confusion.” 

That I could believe. 

“You are not nearly as differ- 
ent from us in mental processes 
and customs as I should have 
thought. Such an intriguing life 
form, with such amusing compli- 
cations. Just strange enough to 
be exciting. Come over here and 
sit by me.” 

She beckoned coyly, like a flirta- 
tious girl, and winked one youth- 
fully glowing eye at me. The 
effect, in that ruin of a face, was 
appalling. I stayed where I was. 

“Oh,” she said in a hurt tone, 
“you don’t like me? And you 
seemed so attractively receptive 
at first. How can we communicate 
completely on your plane if you 
are to be so aloof?” She stopped 
and seemed to concentrate a 
moment. I felt as if something 
gave my thoughts a brisk stir-

ring with a long swizzle stick. 

“Damn it,” I snapped, “quit 
that, you hear me? You’ve got to 
stop messing around in my mind. 
It’s an outrageous invasion of — ” 

“All right, all right,” she said. 
“I won’t do it again, I promise. 
Unless — well, never mind.” A 
t5T3ically feminine-type promise. 
“But now I see that it is simply 
this body that offends you. Ex- 
cept for this, you are quite ready 
to love me.” 

That was putting it a little 
strongly. I had to admit though, 
that she was a pretty interesting 
proposition. 

“It is odd to attach such im- 
portance to form. A chemical life 
characteristic, I suppose. I do 
note that your own structure has 
its — well. There is no reason for 
this present form of mine being 
a problem between us. I shall 
simply change it.” 

“Oh?” Like changing a dress, 
she made it sound. It wasn’t quite 
that easy. 

“You must make it clear to 
me what sort of body you prefer. 
Oh, I see. That tall, widely curved 
one with the red hair. Yes, I 
see the image . my . and so 
lightly clad. Very well. I will 
have this body for you.” 

She was reading my mind 
again, the back corner section 
where I was keeping a few bright- 
ly descriptive memos on Venus 
de Lite, that luscious, languorous. 



long-legged new stripper-exotic 
dancer downtown at the Roma. 
“That,” I told her, not without 
a touch of wistful regret, “is a 
live body. You cannot take live 
bodies. And stop reading my 
mind.” 

“I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.” 
She kept saying that; and doing 
it just the same. “I shall not have 
to take the original body. I can 
simply duplicate it.” 

“How could you do that?” 

“It should not be difficult. The 
elements in the structure are 
common enough here and in 
readily modified forms. The body 
organization is complex, true, and 
not particularly efficient in many 
respects. However, the patterns 
can be readily traced and dupli- 
cated. It is a simple question of 
the application of energy to 
chemical matter. So now you 
must take me to observe this body 
which has such attraction for 
you.” 

II 

rpHAT, as it turned out, was 
the toughest part. I did what 
I could, trying to fix the horrible 
old witch up in an outfit from one 
of Aunt Belle’s old trunks and a 
few rather elementary cosmetics. 
The end result was that, instead 
of looking like a plain old witch, 
she seemed a scandalously de- 
praved, probably drunken old 

GALAXY 



r witch. The Roma, in a long his- 
tory dating back to prohibition 
days, has seen all kinds and con- 
jjitions. But I don’t doubt we 
^ere one of the damnedest look- 
ing couples on record. 

“This — uh — this is my 
Grandma,” I told the few, nastily 
grinning acquaintances I couldn’t 
duck on our way into the joint. 
“Grandma is just up on a little 
visit from Lower Dogpatch. Ex- 
cuse us, would you? Grandma 
needs a double shot quick.” 

That seemed unarguable. We 
finally settled at a small table 
off by the swinging doors to the 
kitchen and sat there through one 
floor show. “All right,” said, my 
old witch, as Venus closed the 
set with her final frenzy in the 
blue spotlight, “I have the pat- 
tern. There are a number of dif- 
ferences there from the picture 
in your mind. The age, the chem- 
icals applied.” 

Venus went off to vigorous ap- 
plause. The club lights came up 
and the M.C. stumbled out to 
favor us with his version of The 
Gent’s Room Joe Miller. I con- 
sidered. The more beautiful- 
looking the doll, I suppose, the 
greater the probable degree of 
illusion. “Where you find discrep- 
ancies,” I told my old witch, “be 
guided by my imagination. 
Right?” 

“All rightie,” she remarked 
i brightly, patting my hand on the 

STAR-CROSSED LOVER 



table as she favored me with 
what I would estimate as one of 
history’s lewdest winks. I noted 
a mutter of contempt from sur- 
rounding tables. “Shall I go 
ahead? Perhaps you’d better 
close your eyes,” she said, “I — ” 

“No, not here!” I grabbed her 
arm and dragged her to her feet. 
Neighbor tables gave us their full 
attention and the muttering took 
on an ominous tone. “Come on. 
For pity’s sake, let’s get on 
home.” I wasn’t exactly con- 
vinced this proposition was going 
to work out; but a crowded night- 
club was no place for her to try 
it. 

“Graverobber!” was one of the 
indignant remarks that caught 
my ear as I dragged the harridan 
out. She giggled. The female, 
species immaterial, seems to have 
a sense of humor ranging from 
the Pollyanna-like to the grave- 
yard ghoulish — missing nearly 
every point between. 

She was quiet and thoughtful 
on the ride back home. So was I, 
pondering the doubtful status of 
my reputation around town and 
my sanity. 

TN THE house, she was brisk 
and businesslike. She got me 
to help her stack a bunch of 
canned goods and junk from the 
refrigerator on the kitchen table 
— “Just for convenience.” She 
remarked domestically, “It would 



64 



65 



have saved your fuel and power 
if I had made the change at the 
other place. I must draw heavily 
on the power that runs into this 
house. I must, you understand, 
conserve my own supply.” 

“Perfectly all right. Be my 
guest.” The whole thing had a 
sort of dream quality to it by 
then. You know how it is in 
dreams sometimes? The action 
and story lines are fantastic. You 
know the whole thing must be 
nonsense. You could, by an effort 
of will, wake up and end it. And 
yet you go along with the thing 
just to see how the foolishness 
will turn out. That is the way I 
felt then. 

“Oh yes, one more detail,” said 
my witch. “What about the eyes? 
I found nothing about the color 
of the eyes in your largely imag- 
inary mental picture of the cheap 
floozy in that second-rate 
saloon.” 

Already she was not only 
speaking the language but think- 
ing the thoughts like a native fe- 
male. The eyes. Hmm. I guess my 
mental film strips of Venus had 
kind of skipped past facial close- 
ups. “Why don’t you just keep 
the same eyes you have now?” I 
suggested. 

“Good,” she said. “They are my 
own design. Here goes. Close your 
eyes; there may be some glare.” 

I closed my eyes. For a mo- 
ment there was nothing. Then, 



for about a second, say, there was 
an intense, flaring glare that 
shone reddish through my closed 
lids. Then it was dark. 

“All righty,” said a sweet-soft 
voice, ending in a little, half- 
breathless giggle. “Now you can 
look.” 

I looked. 

Trouble was, it was still dark. 
No lights. All I could see by 
"the faint light of a half moon fil- 
tering in the kitchen window was 
a dim figure standing by the 
table. 

Fact was, I found later, a sud- 
den power surge on the main line 
outside the house blew a trans- 
former and blacked out the whole 
blinking suburb. 

I snapped out my lighter and 
flicked it on. Well now, indeed! 
There, half shy, half not so shy 
and wearing the same negligible 
costume as in her final number 
at the Roma, was Venus, con- 
structed just exactly the way she 
should have been. 

“The way I built me,” she said, 
and giggled, “to your very ex- 
plicit order. So now what are you 
going to — ” 

I wouldn’t say that I am 
notably more impetuous than the 
next man. That was just an im- 
petuous situation. I let the light- 
er go and grabbed her. “Ah,” I 
remember her saying softly, “now 
we can truly begin to communi- 
cate.”

I can say with every reason- 
able assurance that we did so 
most effectively. Alien she was, 
but she was also a lovely girl, my 
own dream girl. Or girls. What 
man of any imagination at all is 
a totally monogamous dreamer? 
Ansrway, she was unarguably 
lovely, loving, uniquely adapt- 
able, generally sweet. And if, 
once her frequently unfathom- 
able mind was made up, she had 
the determination of seven dedi- 
cated devils — well, she was fe- 
male and probably no worse than 
some billion local girls. My little 
atom-powered space girl had a 
lot more built-in compensating 
factors. 

But that’s as it developed. 
That night, naturally, was largely 
devoted to communication. Luck- 
ily, having been fired, I didn’t 
need to worry about getting up 
to go to work. 

A long about eleven or so the 
next morning she bounced 
out of bed, bright, beautiful and 
lively. I dragged on down to the 
kitchen with her to see if we 
could put together a breakfast 
from whatever staples she hadn’t 
found it necessary to incorporate 
into new construction. By the 
kitchen table I stumbled over the 
most ravaged, deadest looking 
corpse I ever hope to see. It was, 
of course, the unlamented body 
of the original witch, lying just 



where it had dropped the evening 
before. 

“Look, hon, what about this?” 
She shrugged quite charmingly, 
in spite of the tentlike dimensions 
of Aunt Belle’s nightgown. “What 
about it?” 

‘Well, why didn’t you use the 
— uh — material there, instead 
of all the groceries?” 

Another shrug. “I wanted some- 
thing fresh.” 

She had a point. I couldn’t 
argue. I never could, when she 
turned those big green eyes of 
hers on me, full power. “Yeah,” 

I said. “Only what are we going 
to do with it?” j 

“What do your kind do with 
old bodies here?” 

“Mostly we bury them.” 

“All right then.” 

That was unassailable feminine 
logic. All right. So I’d bury it. 

That night, by the eerie light 
of the waning moon, I went at 
it with Uncle John’s pick and 
shovel and buried the old witch’s 
body next to Aunt Belle’s rose 
bushes by the garage. My bright, 
new-incarnation girl lounged 
around and chatted sociably. 
Everything still had quite a 
dreamlike quality; the corpse was 
a final, nightmare touch. But 
even so, I was beginning to won- 
der a bit about things; such things 
as, specifically, where we went 
from there. 

“Star-doll-baby — " well, hell,

■ to use terms like that to com- 

l municate with the female — “you 

aren’t going to vanish all of a 
sudden and leave me now, are 
you? Ugh!” That was a heavy 
shovel and thick clay. “What are 
our plans?” 

“Sil-ly. I understand your cus- 
tom now. We are going to be 
married, of course. Then we shall 
see. There is no hurry. I have, 
by your standards, plenty of time. 
I must assimilate and learn to 
understand you and your fasci- 
nating life-form. We shall live 
together and be man and wife. 
As I have said, your species and 
mine may derive much benefit 
from this intermingling.” 

That, if I understood her cor- 
rectly, sounded fine to me. It 
was the best proposal I’d had yet. 
And surely it would have been 
poor hospitality to a lonely little 
girl some light-years away from 
home for me to have refused. 
“This is terribly sudden,” I told 
her. “Uf! That ought to be enough 
of a hole for as wizened up a 
little old body as that . yes, 
darling, I will marry you. Who’s 
going to earn us a living?”

The next day we applied for 
our license. Three days later we 
were married — so far as I know, 
an interstellar first. The job or 
money problem, as it turned out, 
was no problem. Her first thought 
was the direct, female approach to 
the problem. She could simply 
make it out of old newspapers 
whenever we needed some, as she 
had the body. She made some to 
show me. 

“Well now,” I told her, “it does 
seem the simplest way, I admit. 
But the government is pretty 
jealous of its ability to print 
money. It likes to think that no- 
body else can do the job just 
right.” 

I was afraid this might be one 
of her stubborn points but it 
wasn’t. Government restrictions, 
bureaucracy and red tape were 
things she had no trouble under- 
standing. “It is the same way 
back home with power and en- 
ergy rations,” she told me. “You 
have no idea the difficulty we 
had in building up the capital 
supply necessary for my trip 
here. So I suppose we must find 
another way. Don’t you already 
have some of this money? Or 
couldn’t you manage to borrow 
some?” 

I had $37.62 in my checking 
account, but the house was in 
my name. I borrowed five grand.

I When there was a sudden flash 

I and the lights blinked out, the 

idea hit me. I was scared. What if 
she had gone back, left me? I 
dashed to the kitchen. Just 
through the swinging door, I trip- 
ped over a body and fell into the 
kitchen table. Had she — ? Then 
I heard a charming, slightly ac- 
cented little giggle. 

I didn’t bother with my lighter. 
I reached out, caught her, pulled 
i my sweet little dark-haired baby 

to me and kissed her. “Honey- 
I doll, believe me — I do love you. 
No matter who you are, I love 
you!” 

I meant every word of it, too. 

1 That was a brand of accomoda- 

tion you will never get from any 
, local girl. 



King Midas developed his touch. 
If I sank a buck in land, oil would 
turn up within the week, and if 
it turned out to be a geologically 
inexplicable tiny pocket the next 
week — that would be after I had 
unloaded. Stocks, commodities, it 
made no difference. The money 
rolled in. We had the touch. Paid 
our taxes, too, but she had a way 
with tax loopholes that gave the 
district collector a nervous break- 
down. 

We traveled, but we kept the 
old house. We always came back 
to it for sentimental reasons. We 
spent a lot of time in libraries, 
museums. We went to shows and 
concerts. An3rthing that was go- 
ing, we went to ,it. She had a 
contagious interest that she com- 
municated to — not to say forced 
on — me; and if some of the 
operas and symphonies we 
caught seemed to my elemental 
musical taste to run a little long 
and loud, I had my conipensa- 
tions. And a lot more than most; 
our adjustments were not all one- 
sided. 

Example: We made a tour of 
Europe. Now, I always was a fine, 
loving husband to her. Complete- 
ly faithful. But — well, there was 
a dark-haired, laughing, button- 
cute little chick who sang Span- 
ish songs in English with an Ital- 
ian accent in a little place on the 
Riviera. I didn’t make a pass. I 
didn’t even speak to her. But I 



have to admit that, as a strictly 
idle fancy, she did cross my mind 
once or twice. 

“Hah!” my tall, statuesque, 
beautiful red-haired wife snorted 
at me one evening after we were 
back home. She was sitting listen- 
ing to hi-fi, some of the very 
long-hair music that she called 
“the second most fascinating de- 
velopment of ydur kind.” I was 
just sitting, maybe dozing a bit. 

“So!” She gave it full-force, 
wifely indignation. “You sit there 
and you smile on me — and all 
the time you are thinking of this 
cheap, female, singing bullfighter 
you have seen two times. You 
have two times me in your mind!” 
Already she was talking with 
just the accent that chick had 
used. 

“Now look here,” I protested, 
“you promised not to go prowling 
through my mind. A man is en- 
titled to a little privacy!” 

“How can you think so of this ' 
other woman? You don’t — ” sob 
— “love me any more!” 

Women! That’s the way trsdng ^ 
to argue with them goes. You are 
always on the defensive. 

“Aw now, Star-hon-baby,” I j 
said, “honestly, it was just a pass- 
ing thought. I only — ” i 

“I know what sort of thought 
it was! Very well.” She got up 
and stalked off to the kitchen. 

I didn’t get what she was up to, 
not even when I heard her bang-

^HE next night I had to dig a 
new grave out by the garage 
— a bigger one this time, for a 
big, beautiful, long-legged, red- 
haired body. Funny thing. Con- 
trary to general belief, none of 
this ever seemed to do ans^hing 
for the roses by the garage. They 
had done poorly ever since Aunt 
Belle left and they kept on doing 
poorly. Well, no matter. Six 
months later it was the little 
brimette’s turn to go and we went 
back to red hair. When I say my 
wife was all women to me, I 
mean it. 

The last model was medium

height, Titian shade hair, not 
spectacular but cute, very com- 
panionable, very lovable, beauti- 
fully built, built to last. She was 
some builder, my wife, and she 
did a lot of fine construction work 
for me. 

One_ night, back along about 
the third week of our marriage, I 
got to feeling lousy — sniffles, 
headache, no appetite. 

It was no dramatic plague; 
just a tsqjical, nasty case of flu. 
I used to get them every fall and 
winter. I mixed myself a couple 
of hot lemon and’s, and explained 
it to my (tall, red headed) wife. 
“Oh, yes,” she said. “I see.” 

I had an idea she took another 
quick prowl through my mind 
but I felt too sick to complain. 
“I’m going to bed,” I told her. I 
went. 

Oddly enough, instead of put- 
ting in a restless night, I slept 
like a log. When I woke up the 
next morning, I felt great. In fact, 
as I burst into a spontaneous 
and very tuneful chorus of Body 
and Soul in the shower, it came 
to me that I had never in my 
life felt so well. When I looked 
in the mirror to shave, it seemed 
to me I was even looking better. 

Later that day I was up on the 
roof putting up a TV aerial. I 
hadn’t ever bothered with TV, 
but she wanted to learn all about 
even that. I put up the aerial. 
Then I fell off the roof. I dropped

twelve feet, landing on my left 
arm and shoulder on hard-packed 
lawn. Then I got up and dusted 
myself off. No damage. I was all 
right. 

“Clumsy,” she said to me from 
the porch. 

“No,” I said. “Damn it, there 
was this loose shingle up there. 
It slipped right out from under 
me and — anyway, you might 
at least be a little sympathetic. 
It’s a wonder I didn’t break my 
arm. In fact, I can’t understand 
why I didn’t.” 

“Nothing broke because of the 
improvements I made in you last 
night.” 

“What?” 

“Darling,” she said, “I made a 
few improvements. Of course, 
you were very attractive, lover. 
Perfectly charming. But structur- 
ally, really, you were a most im- 
perfect mechanism. So now that 
I have made a study of these 
bodies your people use, I . 
rebuilt you.” 

“Oh? Oh! Now, look here! Who 
in hell said you could?” 

I T did, at the time, seem pretty 
damned officious. I was sore. 
However, I had to admit that the 
changes she made worked out 
rather well. A strong, light metal- 
lic alloy seems to make much 
better bones than can be rnade of 
calcium. General immunity to 
disease was desirable, I couldn’t 



deny. My re-wired nervous sys- 
tem and modified muscular struc- 
ture were as pleasant to work 
with as they were efficient. I was 
a new man. 

Of course, every woman al- 
ways wants to make a finer speci- 
men of whatever slob she marries. 
Only I had the luck to get the 
one who knew how to do the job 
properly — from the inside out, 
rather than by simply peck, peck, 
pecking away at the outside. 

It was all as near perfect as a 
marriage can be. I have no. com- 
plaints now — and very few 
even then. She had built me to 
last a couple of centuries. I was 
ready and willing to string along 
with her all the way. 

But it never does work out 
that way, does it? 

What happened to us, as it 
does to most, was that at the end 
of the third year she got preg- 
nant. A very ordinary female 
trait, you may say, and not ordi- 
narily surprising. No. Except that 
she was no ordinary female. 

We were in bed one night — 
out last night as it turned out — 
when she told me. 

“Darling,” she said, and kissed 
me. “I have something to tell 
you.” 

“Haw?” I was sort of sleepy. 

“I’ve been hoping and hoping 
it would happen, but I wasn t sure 
it could.” 

“Ha? Whatsat?”

“Darling, we — are going to 
become parents.” 

“What?” I was awake then. 
“We’re going to have a baby? 
Why, that’s great. Wonderful! Do 
you think he’ll take after me?” 
As I thought it over, it seemed 
something of a problem. What 
would the heredity be? In fact, 
how could it be? 

“Never mind, darling,” she said 
quietly — sadly, I like to think, 
as I look back on it “That’s 
woman’s work, you know. Just 
leave the details to me.” 

I kissed her. We were very lov- 
ing and tender. I went to sleep, 
and dreamed all night long that I 
was Siamese twins in a fratricidal 
finish fight over my model wife. 

IV 

T woke up by daylight to a hor- 
rible, icy, lost and separated 
feeling, as though part of me had 
really died. I reached out my 
hand for reassurance — and I 
yelled. 

That sweet, soft-curved body 
in the bed next to me was cold 
and dead. 

“Please! don’t be frightened. 
It’s all right. Really, it’s all right.” 
That was a voice that wasn’t a 
voice again, as back in the be- 
ginning. It was familiar and at 
the same time new. It wasn't all 
right! I looked up, over the bed. 
There were not one but two tiny. 



blinding-bright pinpoints of light. 

“What? Who?” 

“Father,” they said, “we are 
your children.” 

They were certainly not my 
idea of it. 

“No. Oh, no! Star-baby, where 
are you?” 

“Here. We were she. Now she 
plus you has become us. She has 
divided and now we are two, the 
children of you and she.” 

“Nonsense. Quit the double talk 
and give it to me straight!” 
Double talk it was. But if it was 
nonsense, it was an unhappy sort 
of nonsense I couldn’t get around. 

Coming slightly out of shock, 
I tried arguing and got nowhere. 
I never won any arguments from 
their mother either. I was con- 
vinced in spite of myself that this 
was the simple, brutal truth. It 
was the way of reproduction of 
her form of life. My alien wife 
had divided, to become two half- 
alien offspring. 

I felt lousy. I didn’t want two 
bright, pin-point kids. I wanted 
my wife. “But look, why couldn’t 
one of you — ” 

“Why, father!” I got it in a tone 
of shocked horror. “Such a thing 
would be positively incestuous. 
No. We must go now. This is 
what mother-we came here for — 
to mix and to re-vitalize her-our 
people by the addition of a fresh, 
new stream of life force.” 

“You mean me?” It was flat-

tering to think my stock would 
invigorate the population of a 
sun, but it was no cure for the 
loneliness in which I was lost. 
“You are going back across space 
— and leave me here alone?” 
"Yes, father. We must leave at 
onee.” 

“Oh, now, wait just one radiat- 
ing little minute! You say I’m 
your father. Well, I forbid — ” 
Weary patience. “Now, father, 
please.” 

“But — will you come back 
sometime?” 

“Certainly. With the success 
of her-our mission, we hope the 
factions back home will imite in 
a policy of further interchange. 
We and others of our family will 
come. Soon, we hope. It could 
even prove possible to find a way 
of converting you to our own 
form, so that later you may re- 
turn with us.” 

“But look—” 

But that was it. A few more 
words and, “Goodby, father,” they 
said, putting a reasonable amount 
of regret into it — even though I 
know damned well they were it- 
ching to get going. “And do take 
care of yourself.” 

They were gone. I was alone. 
No big, lush and lovely wife; no 
button-cute little brunette wife; 
no gay, lively, companionable, 
, loving Titian-haired wife. No wife 
at all. 

, I had never been so alone. 



Nothing but me. What was I to 
do? 

Well, there was only one pos- 
sible thing to do, and I did it. 
I got drunk. I hung one on. It 
was a beauty. Sometime in the 
course of the following night I 
held a tearful wake' out by the 
garage and I buried my wife’s 
last body. That, I recognize, was 
thoughtless. I could and should 
have called doctors and under- 
takers to tell me there was no 
life left in the body, and then let 
them do the digging for me in a 
more formal, costly manner. But, 
for one thing, I was drunk. For 
another, I guess I’d just sort of 
gotten into the habit of doing 
it the other way. 

TV/TUCH too early the next day 
— like about 2:30 in the 
afternoon — the doorbell rang. I 
was totally despondent, nursing 
my sorrow and a fat hangover 
with a cold beer and some of 
my Star-baby’s more heavily 
long-hair, hi-fi selections. 

I let the bell ring for a while. 
Then I let somebody pound on 
the door for a bit. But that got 
to be hard on my headache so I 
went to the door. 

There was Mrs. Schmerler, 
from next door, who used to be a 
real biddy-buddy of my Aunt 
Belle’s. There were a couple of 
hard-eyed cops with her, too. 
They all pushed right on in.

“Celebrating something, Mac?” 
inquired cop number one, while 
Mrs. Schmerler and the other 
glared suspiciously about. 

“No,” I said, too miserable to 
think. ^“Not celebrating, mourn- 
ing. Just lost my wife, and kids, 
too.” 

“He never had any children!” 
said Mrs. Schmerler. “Only 
women. And a great deal too 
many of the cheap tarts. What 
his poor, dear Aunt Belle, as 
saintly a woman as ever lived, 
would say'. Why don’t you 
ask him what he w^s digging for 

— digging and yowling Star dust 

— out there by his garage last 
night? And not the first time, 
neither!” 

The sudden realization of what , 
could be turned up out there by 
the garage — and how that would 
look to the unsympathetic and 
non-credulous eyes of the law — 
hit me. I opened and closed my 
mouth three or four times like 
an unwell goldfish. Nothing came 
out except a miasma of alcohol. 
Mrs. Schmerler gaped at me with 
delighted shock, indignation and 
horror. It was the great moment 
of her life. 

The cops stepped in — not 
aggressively, more big-brotherly 
— and took a good, firm grip on 
my arm. 

I won’t go into the rest of all 
that. They got a squad and they 
dug. They took me in. I wouldn’t 



talk. They locked me up. Cell 
block bookies quoted 50-1, no 
takers, I would make the death 
cell. The way I felt, I didn’t care. 
The newspapers went wild. 
Things had been slow since the 
election. All my old pals from 
my working days on the paper 
were making a buck with special 
“Even then there was something 
frighteningly different about him” 
feature stories. 

The next day, as my hangover 
faded and I got to thinking things 
over, my outlook changed. It was 
no time for me to give up. I 
would get a lawyer. 

I walked over to rattle my cell 
door for a bit. “Hey! Hey there, 
guard. Come here a minute, huh?” 
y He came. “So? Is our Blue- 
beard softening up? Want to 
make a statement?” 

“Uh-uh. Not me. I just want 
to ask a question. Those bodies, 
are they going to autopsy them?” 
“Not yet. Today.” 

“Well, look—” 

I had a little trouble persuad- 
ing him, but I got him to take 
down all the data I could re- 
member on the first one, the old 
hag. There would be records on 
her at the County Hospital. 
They’d never make any charge 
worse than bod 3 ^-snatching stick 
on that one. 

The others? I chuckled. I was 
imagining the medical officers’ 
expressions when they ran in|p

those stainless-steel bones, plastic 
circulatory system, metallic wir- 
ing and Ae assorted other little 
innovations that my wife — my 
late wife — had installed in her 
body-building exercises. That 
would give them something to 
think about. 

So — that’s my story; all of it 
up to now. I’m still here in my 
cool little cell, and I am damned 
lonesome. But I am not scared. I 
figure I have about four different 
kinds of insurance. 

I N the first place, the way I am 
built now, with all the improve- 
ments in structure and durability 
she put into me, I doubt they 
could electrocute me. I’d probably 
just short the equipment out. A 
thing like that would make me 
quite a scientific curiosity, no 
doubt; but not, at least, a dead 
one. 

Second, there are my invest- 
ments and the way the money has 
piled up. You know and I know 
perfectly well that they just don’t 
ever send a million bucks plus 
to any electric chair. 

Besides, third place, while I 
have no doubt I can be convicted 
of something, I don’t see how it 



could be murder. I wouldn’t be 
surprised to see me get sent to 
the loony bin. I won’t much mind 
that. I have nothing to do but 
wait anyway. 

And, in the fourth place, which 
is what I am waiting for, there 
are my children — hers and mine. 
They are coming back. Soon, I 
hope. Not alone, I hope. “Tell 
them back there,” was the last 
thing I said before they left, “tell 
them I want a girl just like the 
girl that married your dear old 
dad.” 

I admit it’s a poor thing for a 
man to have to send his kids to 
do his courting for him — but at 
least mine are pretty exceptional 
children. Much better informed 
than most, too. They should bring 
me back a new bride. They’ve got 
to. 

Somehow I kind of have a feel- 
ing now that a blonde — maybe 
a tall, willowy, statuesquely 
stacked type — might be nice for 
a while. After that, I don’t know. 
I’ll have to think it over. The 
waiting is what is going to be 
tough. 

Kids aren’t really undepend- 
able today. Are they?

ing for Picatinny. When intro- 
duced into active service it will 
probably get a different name, 
but for the moment Projectile P 
will do. 

The first point I have to make, 
after stating that I got to see it 
as a result of a kind invitation by 
Major General W. K. Ghormley 
to pay a visit to the Arsenal, is 
that this is the complete projec- 
tile. I trust that it wasn’t loaded, 
but otherwise nothing is missing, 
except for one little item which 
I’ll mention later. But the missing 



little item is not, repeat not, the 
nose cone. 

Projectile P is, as has been 
mentioned, an anti-tank weapon, 
meant to be fired by other tanks. 
The very fact that it is to be car- 
ried by another tank produces a 
number of problems. It mustn t 
weigh too much. More important- 
ly, it must not take up too much 
space. And it must be capable of 
punching a hole through another 
tank’s skin, no matter how tough 
and how thick that skin might 
be.

^NE might say that the prob- 
lem began in 1887. 

At that time chemists almost 
anywhere were, if the term can 
be used in this case, knee-deep in 
high-explosives research. Only a 
few useful high explosives were 
known: guncotton, discovered ac- 
cidentally by Christian Friedrich 
Schonbein in 1845, and dynamite, 
discovered equally accidentally 
by Alfred Nobel in 1866. Of 
course nitroglycerin was known 
since it is the basis of dynamite. 
But nitroglycerin was so untrust- 
worthy that several countries had 
passed laws simply forbidding its 
manufacture. 

As for guncotton, military engi- 
neers distinguished two kinds. 
One contained more than twelve 
per cent of water and was there- 
fore referred to as “wet’^ guncot- 
ton. It was perfectly safe to 
handle but very hard to explode. 
The other kind of guncotton was 
logically known as “dry” guncot- 



ton (5 per cent water or less) and 
it was easy to explode, but by 
the same token it was unreliable. 
As for Nobel’s dynamite it was 
safe, but nobody, Nobel himself 
included, had yet succeeded in 
inventing a really reliable igniting 
cap for it. Moreover most experts 
felt — correctly, it must be 
added — that dynamite was fine 
for construction and mining pur- 
poses but was not suited for mili- 
tary applications. 

Military engineers and ord- 
nance men hoped for an explosive 
which could not only be handled 
safely but could even be mis- 
treated with impunity — but 
which would explode with great 
power if the prop>er fuze was ap- 
plied to it. (To avoid receiving 
letters about that “misspelled” 
word I wish to point out that, dur- 
ing World War II, the Chief of 
Ordnance laid down a rule: fuzes 
used in ammunition of any kind 
are spelled with a “z”, while a

“fuse” is something you replace 
after you had a short circuit.) 

One of the researchers was an 
American, Professor Charles E. 
Munroe. The aspect of his work 
which interests us here had to do 
with the damage which is in- 
flicted on steel plate by a nearby 
explosion. His tests were con- 
ducted on an old bank safe with 
various kinds of explosive sub- 
stances, standard as well as ex- 
perimental. Fairly small samples 
of the explosives were attached 
to the safe and then exploded. 

One of the samples was a disk 
of compressed guncotton, with 
the letters U. S. N. and the year 
1884 indented on its face, indi- 
cating year of manufacture and 
ownership. 

After this disk had been ex- 
ploded, Professor Munroe in- 
spected the steel plate for dam- 
age. It was negligible, just as he 
had expected; but to his intense 
surprise he now saw the letters 
U. S. N. and the date 1884 in- 
dented in the steel. Nobody had 
ever seen anything like that and 
there was no explanation. 

Professor Munroe wondered 
whether the fact that the “bot- 
tom” of each indented letter had 
been a short distance from the 
metal could have anything to do 
with it. At first glance this did not 
seem likely; Munroe himself had 
exploded charges Vi inch, Vz inch 
and as much one inch away from 



the metal plate to see what would 
happen. Nothing had. 

But then he reasoned that he 
did not deal with a short distance 
away from the metal only. It was 
a combination of two things; a 
short airspace between plate and 
high explosive under the indented 
letters; but this short airspace 
was surrounded by high explosive 
fitting against the metal. 

To test his idea he took a small 
bundle of sticks of dynamite, 
pulled the stick in the center back 
for about an inch, then tied the 
bundle tightly and placed it 
against the steel plate. The explo- 
sion promptly punched a hole in- 
to the “burglarprooP safe. 

The same quantity of dyna- 
mite, exploded against the steel in 
open air, had hardly even dented 
it. 

I F the date of the experiment 
had been 1957 instead of 1887, 
Professor Munroe’s journal 
would have been stamped 
SECRET immediately. Since this 
was 1887, Professor Munroe de- 
scribed what had happened in an 
article in Scribner’s Magazine 
(March issue of 1888), wrote a 
technical article about it for Pro- 
fessor Silliman’s American Jour- 
nal oi Science (’Wave-like effects 
produced by the detonation of 
guncotton,” vol. 36, 1888) and, 
at a later date (1900) rewrote 
this article in popular form for

the magazine Popular Science 
Monthly. 

Other researchers repeated the 
experiment in various forms, 
found it correct and began speak- 
ing about the “Munroe effect”. 
They all agreed that the Munroe 
effect consisted in focusing an ex- 
plosion. The gases develop)ed by 
the high explosive around the 
cavity ran into each other and, so 
to speak, compromised on a con- 
centrated blast in a specific direc- 
tion. 

In Germany one researcher. 
Dr. Egon Neumann, spent a good 
deal of time investigating the 
Munroe effect and developed ar- 
rangements and shapes which 
produced it best. He reported on 
his work in 1914 in a German 
scientific journal under the title 
“New types of hollow bodies 
made of explosive substances”. 



Thereafter Germans talked about 
the “Neumann Effekt.” In the 
meantime a German explosives 
manufacturer, the WASAG (the 
letters stand for Westphalisch- 
Anhaltische SprengstoS Aktienge- 
sellschait or Westphalian-Anhal- 
tian Explosives, Inc.), had taken 
out several patents for such 
shaped charges. They were used 
to replace the rock drill in ore 
mines. The shaped charges 
punched deep and narrow holes 
into the rock, then dynamite 
sticks were inserted into these 
holes for blasting. 

This went on all through the 
first World War . and nobody 
ever conceived the idea that 
something that punches holes 
through armor plate might have a 
military application! 

After the first World War a 
Russian, M. Kukharevsky, began

to look at the Munroe-Neumann 
effect and wrote (in the journal 
Technology of the Red Army) 
about “Researches concerning the 
question of whether there is a 
possibility of increasing the effect 
of high explosives by the method 
of the accumulation wave.” 

But in spite of all the learned 
treatises in German and in Rus- 
sian the Munroe effect was finally 
used for military purposes in the 
country of its discovery. The first 
weapon to carry a shaped charge 
was the famous bazooka of World 
War II. It had been learned in 
the meantime — I don’t know 
when and by whom that the 
punch of a shaped charge was 
very noticeably increased if the 
cavity of the high explosive was 
lined with thin metal. Wartime 
research also established that not 
every metal was equally effective 
as a liner. Lead and aluminum 
liners did not add much. A steel 
liner did and, surprisingly, a zinc 
liner was quite effective. What 
was used in the bazooka was 
simply steel; what is in use how 
is, naturally, classified. The rea- 
son why such a metal liner in- 
creases the force is easy to under- 
stand. The explosion tears the 
liner into tiny particles which are 
added to the blast and probably 
act somewhat like an abrasive. 

The bazooka which carried the 
first shaped charges into battle 
was a rocket, a rather slow one. It 



was easy to follow its flight .all 
the way from launching tube to 
target. Then shaped charges were 
used in slightly larger rockets 
(airborne), in grenades and, I 
believe, in mortar shells. None of 
these types of ammunition spins 
in flight. If you visualize the ac- 
tion of the Munroe effect care- 
fully you’ll realize that it would 
be diluted by a spinning projec- 
tile. 

But bazooka-type rockets and 
rifle grenades do not have much 
range. Moreover, they are not 
very accurate. They lack both in 
range and in accuracy because of 
the fact that they are not very 
fast. They are much slower by far 
than an artillery projectile. 

T his is what led up to Projeo 
tile P. 

If you could fire a shaped 
charge from a long— barreled high 
velocity artillery piece you would 
get the velocity and with it range 
and accuracy. But you also get 
spin. Could one fire a shell with- 
out causing it to spin? Well, yes, 
but it must be stabilized in flight 
somehow. Bombardment rockets 
are stabilized by fins at their rear 
ends and so are mortar shells. 

Why not a fin-stabilized artil- 
lery projectile? 

There are some problems, one 
of which is the fact that any pro- 
jectile is in a very curious situa- 
tion immediately after leaving 



82 



GALAXY 



the muzzle. Since a few figures 
are needed at this point I’ll quote 
those for the German infantry 
rifle, model 1898, which ’may 
safely be considered to be public 
property. When this rifle was 
fired with its normal cartridge, 
the bullet left the muzzle with a 
velocity of 2900 feet per second. 
When the same rifle was fired 
with the same cartridge but with 
the bullet removed, the combus- 
tion gases left the muzzle with a 
velocity of nearly 7000 feet per 
second. The point is that they still 
did this, even if they had pro- 
pelled the bullet — which means 
that the bullet, immediately after 
leaving the muzzle, fovmd itself 
in a strong “wind” of hot combus- 
tion gases which were faster than 
the bullet and blew against its 
stern. 

For a sj)herical bullet this 
doesn’t matter much. For an elon- 
gated bullet it does. And for a 
fin-stabilized bullet it could cause 
trouble. (Needless to say, the 
condition of the hot powder gases 
blowing from the rear holds true 
for any firearm of any size or con- 
struction.) Normally a designer 
would help himself with a long 
nose cone and fins on a rather 
long spike. But a shorter projec- 
tile has advantages too, not even 
counting the problem of storage 
space. 

In the case of Projectile P, the 
fuze had to stick out in front on 



a spike so that the shap>ed charge 
would explode before it had been 
squashed flat by the impact. It 
then turned out that the shock 
wave caused by the spike acted 
very nearly like the nose cone of 
another projectile. It did not 
spread out fast enough, so that it • 
still hit the body of the projectile. 
But by adding a little collar to 
the spike this problem could be 
solved. 

That’s the reason why Projec- 
tile P does not have the normal 
ogive in front. 

Since the front end could be 
shortened, the tail end could be 
shortened too; the fins are closer 
to the body than one would ex- 
pect. Fine, but now the armor- 
punching projectile has to be fired 
from the gun which is mounted in 
the tank turret. That gun has a 
rifled barrel and should not be 
made unusable for its normal 
ammunition. 

Well, sometimes a problem can 
be solved by putting the cart 
before the horse. Normal ammu- 
nition has driving bands which 
are forced into the groves be- 
tween the lands of the gun barrel 
and which spin the shell. Projec- 
tile P has a rotating band, a band 
which is forced into the rifling, 
making a gastight seal. But here 
only the band rotates. The projec- 
tile is left alone,, to be stabilized 
in flight by its tail fins. 

The whole cartridge, roughly 



FOR YOUR INFORMATIPN 



83 



three feet in length, hardly looks 
different from an artillery car- 
tridge of about the same size. 
Compared to a cartridge for an 
anti-aircraft gun the shell looks 
very short. And, of course, the 
nose cone seems to be missing. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

My father, who was bom and 
grew up in Hamburg used to tell 
me that it is possible to see stars 
in full daylight, provided that you 
look up through a tall opening 
such as a mine shaft or tall fac- 
tory chimney. I have recently 
been able to test his story but the 
result was negative. Could this be 
due to the fact that Hamburg is 
about 10° farther North than 
Chicago? 

Karl Wechselmann 

Chicago 56, 111. 

No, this is due to the fact that 
this legend is rather wide-spread 
in Germany but not in the United 
States. I have recently re-read 
the third volume of Baron Alex- 
ander von Humboldt’s Kosmos — 
for an entirely different reason, of 
course — and found that the 
famous traveler had been an- 
noyed by the same story. Being 
Humboldt, he had traced the 
whole history of the idea. 

He had heard it when a boy 
and had, naturally, tried it and 
failed. This failure annoyed him 



and he never missed an oppor- 
timity during his long life to 
check back on it. He found that 
the oldest mention is in Aristo- 
tle’s works, “in a place where one 
would never have looked for it,” 
namely in the book on animals. 
Aristotle says that stars can be 
seen in daylight from dark “cis- 
terns” and Humboldt explained 
that these “cisterns” are subter- 
ranean caves with fresh water 
springs. In order to provide some 
illumination a shaft was dug from 
the roof of the cistern to the sur- 
face. 

Alexander von Humboldt then 
reminded his readers that he, in 
his young days, had been the 
supervisor of mining in a German 
duchy, having therefore many 
opportunities to test the story. 
But he had never succeeded. The 
Swiss “natural philosopher” Hor- 
ace Benedict de Saussure re- 
ported that his guides at the 
Montblanc swore they could see 
stars when looking up from the 
bottom of a nearly vertical moun- 
tain side. Humboldt pointed out 
that de Saussure himself did not 
see stars and that two other Swiss, 
the brothers Hermann and 
Adolph Schlagintweit, also did 
not succeed and that, finally, he 
himself had spent years in the 
high mountains of South America 
and had never succeeded, even 
though he could see Jupiter and 
Venus when the sun was in the

sky. Humboldt was a most meth- 
odical man. 

But then Sir John Herschel, in 
his Outlines of Astronomy would 
write: “We have ourselves heard 
it stated by a celebrated Optician, 
that the earliest circumstance 
which drew his attention to as- 
tronomy, was the regular appear- 
ance, at a certain hour, for several 
successive days, of a considerable 
star, through the shaft of a chim- 
ney.” Humboldt quickly struck up 
ephemeral friendships with pro- 
fessional chimney-sweeps, who all 
assured him that they had never 
seen stars through their chimneys 
in daytime. But it seemed to 
them that the stars seen through 
a chimney at night seemed to be 
enlarged. 

In short, there is nothing to 
the story. It is, of course, possible 
that Jupiter or Venus happen to 
be in the piece of sky visible 
through a slanting mineshaft. But 
if they are visible under these 
conditions they would also be 
visible from the top of this shaft, 
provided you know where to look 
for them. 

I have been trying to find a 
list of the larger asteroids but my 
local librarian has not been able 
to help me. One other question: 
does any asteroid ever become a 
naked-eye object? 

(Mrs.) Diana Fields 

Trenton, New Jersey 



Well, I can oblige you with a 
list of the first 35 asteroids, which 
is sure to include most of the 
largest of them. (Some of the 
Trojan asteroids, in the orbit of 
Jupiter, are quite large but are 
not in this list because they were 
discovered quite late.) No aster- 
oid ever reaches visual magnitude 
6, which is usually considered to 
be the smallest magnitude visible 
to the naked eye. I may add here 
that the well known astronomer 
Dr. Bobrovnikoff once told me 
that he found many people, 
among his students, I presume, 
which could see stars of magni- 
tude 7 imder fine conditions. But 
for normal eyesight, or eyesight 
corrected to normal by glasses, 
and under normal conditions you 
can’t hope to see an asteroid with- 
out the aid of a telescope. 

In a newspaper article about 
life forms of other planets it was 
mentioned that there are life 
forms which do not feed on or- 
ganic substances like animals and 
do not need sunlight, like plants. 
Can you tell me more about them, 
if they really exist? 

Dave McGuire 
Rutherford, New Jersey 

Yes, they do exist, but one 
could say that they do depend on 
plant life even though they do not 
eat vegetable matter. Plants, re- 
member, use a process called 



86 



GALAXY 



photosynthesis. They can convert 
simple chemical compounds into 
complicated so-called organic 
compounds, provided liquid 

water is present and there is sun- 
light as an energy source. The by- 
product of photosynthesis is free 
oxygen. The life forms which do 
not live on vegetable matter but 
do not need sunlight either utilize 
a process called chemosynthesis. 
They are a special group of bac- 
teria which have names like nitro- 
gen bacteria, methane bacteria, 
and sulphur bacteria. They can 
build up complex molecules from 



simple molecules without needing 
sunlight, but they do need oxygen. 
As a rule one does not consider 
oxygen a “vegetable matter” since 
it is a chemical element. But in 
the ecology of a whole planet it 
is practical to remember that free 
oxygen would not exist if the 
plants did not keep making it; 
without a steady production of 
more oxygen, the oxygen that 
happens to be in a planetary 
atmosphere would quickly be 
used up by oxidizing whatever 
can be oxidized.

I THE 
LONG 
I SILVERY 
DAY 



By MAGNUS LUDENS 

44¥ ETS go slumming,” said 
-Li Powers-of-pearl. “Let’s give 
an earthman his wish for a day. 
We haven’t played that game in 
ages.” 

“How do we pick him?” Fire- 

88 



pride asked indulgently. “Phone 
book?” 

“Intensity’s more fun. But no 
more nomads, I got so bored put- 
ting connoisseur features on syn- 
thetic camels!” 

GALAXY 



Peter Stone put on his hat and 
started for the station. Every 
third step he inhaled and told 
himself: “It isn’t that bad.” Peter 
bad a good job, a good wife, and 
commuting was wearing him 
down to a twitch. Sooty teeth- 
rattling train, Penn Station’s 
steaming caverns, a soggy lurch- 
ing bus, lunch down in sun-seared, 
exhaust-ventilated streets and 
the ride home ... as the hated 
maroon dot of his train app>eared, 
a convulsion of revulsion shook 
him. 

“I wish it weren’t that bad!” 
he thought with every fiber. And 
Powers-of-pearl, suffused with the 
glow of challenge, laughed. 

Peter Stone, fighting at the 
newsstand, noted with annoyance 
that a crew of maintenance men 
swarmed about the train. “Broke 
down again," he thought bitterly. 
Halfway down his car two men 
ran a vacuum cleaner over the 
tired plush. Keeping pace behind 
them, two others aimed wide- 
mouth silver hoses upwards, 
spreading thick sheets of foam on 
the ceiling. It wasn’t xmtil Peter 
Stone unfolded his newspaper 
that he noticed how quiet had 
spread with that foam. Next, his 
ears registered with surprise the 
purr of freshly-oiled machinery, 
and his eyes the sight of a tree, 
for once without its double win- 
dow screen of hair-oil and dried 
grime droplets. 

THE LONG, SILVERY DAY 



When he boarded his bus, a 
maintenance man was just hang- 
ing a sign over the gagged fare 
box: 

Due to Tax Readjustment, 

Urban Transportation Free. 

The driver, liberate^ from 
change-making and police duties, 
smiled a greeting at him. No 
crush in the bus, perhaps because 
there seemed so many about. The 
silver one coming towards him 
had a big green and white sign: 
DOWN FIFTH TO 33rd. WEST 
ON 33rd TO SEVENTH. PENN 
STATION LAST STOP. It was 
the first readable bus sign he 
remembered seeing. 

Whenever the light turned red, 
he found, squads of maintenance 
men darted about the stopped 
cars and trucks, slapping silver 
cylinders over each exhaust pipe. 
He could hear snatches of explan- 
ations: “City ordinance,” “Free 
service.” As soon as a cylinder was 
in place, smoke and noise stopped 
coming out of the exhaust. 

Vjf^TIEN his hat sailed gaily to- 
wards the hook. Peter 
Stone realized that, incredibly, he 
wasn’t tired. Work flowed through 
his fingers, his secretary smiled, 
his boss looked in once and whis- 
tled. At noon only the thought of 
paraffined carton coffee restrained 
him from staying in. 

89 



“Coming right up, Seventeen!” 
said the new silver grille next to 
the elevator button. Cheered, he 
clove the mindless rush down- 
stairs and pushed inside a lunch- 
eonette where maintenance men 
were finishing the removal of 
every second stool and the re- 
upholstery of the remainder with 
foam cushions. A smiling waitress 
brought him a menu and a pencil. 
OppHDsite each item was a small 
circle, and a line at the top ex- 
plained: THIS IS YOUR MEN- 
UCHECK. PLEASE MARK 
WANTED ITEMS, DROP 
MENUCHECK IN SLOT. 

Served incredibly fast, Peter 
Stone ate in blissful peace. On his 
way out he saw that the cashier’s 
cage had been replaced with three 
silver cabinets with hoppers for 
Menuchecks and money, recessed 
cups for change and a turnstile 
each. When he walked through he 
found that he still had forty 
minutes of his lunch hour left. 

Forty minutes! He could walk 
to a bookshop, or the park . 
walk, through exhaust fumes and 
the belches of airconditioner 
waste? But silver mesh covered 
the noissome vents. A cautious 
sniff assured him it worked. 

He decided to walk to the 
Library newsstands for a foreign 
magazine. As he reached 42nd 
and Fifth an army of workmen 
were putting the last touches on a 
structure of dull silver that 



spanned the four sides of the in- 
tersection. Airy and elegant, with 
faint echoes of Library style, the 
quadruple arch provided the per- 
fect finishing touch for the square. 
Each side was composed of three 
escalators and moving platforms 
in both directions, with a set of 
stairs and a promenade. 

- Timidly, he set foot, on the sil- 
ver filigree. He was wafted up, 
across and down. Beneath him 
flowed a brilliant river of quiet 
cars. Fascinated, he took the trip 
back, then stood on the promen- 
ade watching the pattern, breath- 
ing in incredulous lungfuls of 
clean air. 

The afternoon fled on newly 
silent feet. Once more he put on 
his hat to face the ride home. 

H IS small, air-conditioned sil- 
ver bus reached Penn Sta- 
tion ten minutes earlier than 
usual. By now Peter Stone was 
not overly surprised to see silver 
moving ways disappearing into 
the Station’s maw, nor, once in- 
side, to feel breezes that blew 
silently from silver gadgets like 
jet engines. He also accepted the 
waiting passengers dancing in the 
great lobby — ^the piped music 
there had long been excellent. 

A low, pleasant voice an- 
nounced his train in diamond-cut 
syllables that floated from silver- 
dollar speakers spangling the 
walls. Silver escalators swept to 



90 



GALAXY 



a bright platform covered in 
springy non-skid green plastic. 

One wall of his train was made 
Up of clear plastic sliding doors. 
Inside, there were deep pile car- 
pets, reclining chairs, low blue 
overheads and movable reading 
lights. As the doors slid softly 
shut, Peter Stone remembered as 
usual the letter he’d forgotten to 
mail for his wife; but this time he 
could see a stamp machine and 
mail box at the end of the car. 
When he got up he saw that there 
were also milk, coffee, soda, fruit, 
cigarette, aspirin and newspaper 
vending machines, and three tele- 
phone booths. 

The train glided to a hushed 
halt three minutes after a speaker 
at his elbow had murmured the 
name of his station. Before his 
wife’s goggling eyes, Peter Stone 
bonded down the steps and ran 
to their car. She remembered that 
evening the rest of her life. 

Powers-of-pearl let the silver 
evaporate, and with it the mem- 
ory of it. “The best game yet,” she 
smiled, leaning in happy exhaus- 
tion against Firepride’s shoulder. 

“You were magnificent,” 
laughed Fire-pride. “One step 
ahead of an entire city!” Powers- 
of-pearl blushed radiantly. 

No trace of their game re- 
mained. But for some obscure rea- 
son, Peter Stone decided that one 
day he would run for Mayor.

T he dancing green blip 
traced an erratic course 
upon the glossy gray 
screen, the jagged-line pattern 
repeated over and over, its out- 
line going from dim to sharply 
emerald brightness to dim again 
before fading. The technician cut 
the switch. There was a sustained 
whir of reorganization within the 
machine as the data-cards were 
refiled. 



92 



GALAXY 



“Care to see it again, sir?” asked 
the technician. His fingers hov- 
ered over the dials, his body in 
an attitude of impending motion. 

Jerry Norcriss tilted his head 
in a brief, authoritative nod. The 
technician started the machine 
again. With a soft humming, the 
gray circular screen began to 
pulse once more with that dancing 
line of brightness. 

“Now, here, sir,” said the tech. 



“is where the scanner beam first 
caught the pulse of the creature.” 
Jerry nodded, his eyes riveted 
to that zigzag phosphor pattern 
upon the screen. He noted the 
soaring peaks and plunging val- 
leys with something like dismay. 
“It’s a powerful one,” he mar- 
veled. It was one of his rare 
comments. Space Zoologists 
rarely spoke at all, to any but 
their own kind, and even then 



BIG BABY 



93 



were typically terse of speech. 

The tech, almost as impressed 
by this — for Jerry — long 
speech as he had been by the 
first warning from Naval Space 
Corps Headquarters on Earth, 
could only nod grimly. His own 
eyes were as intent upon the 
screen as Jerry’s. 

“Here — ” the line was glowing 
its brightest now — “here’s where 
the creature passed directly be- 
neath the scanner-beam. That’s 
the full strength of its life-pulse.” 
The line lost clarity and strength, 
faded. “And here’s where it was 
lost again, sir.” 

“Time of focus?” snapped 
Jerry, trying to keep his voice 
calm. 

“Nearly a full minute,” said the 
tech, still blinking at the screen. 
It was now devoid of impulse, 
barren once more. “That means 
that whatever the thing is, it’s big, 
sir. Damned big, to stay at maxi- 
mum pulse that long.” 

“I know very well what it 
means!” Jerry grated. “The thing’s 
so — ” 

The tech smiled bleakly. 
“ — incredible, sir?” 

Jerry’s nod was thoughtful. 
“The only word for it. Ensign.” 
His inner eye kept repeating for 
him that impossible green pat- 
tern he’d seen. The strong, flat 
muscles of his shoulders and neck 
knotted into what could easily 
become a villainous tension-head- 

94 



ache. Jerry realized suddenly that 
he was badly scared . 

the tech said suddenly, 
^ “I was under the impression 
that the roborocket scanners 
couldn’t miss a life-pulse on a 
planet. I mean, making a com- 
plete circuit of the planet every 
ninety minutes, for a period of six 
months . It’s impossible for 
them to miss an uncatalogued 
life-form.” 

“I know it is,” said Jerry 
Norcriss, pushing blunt fingers 
through his shock of prematurely 
white hair. “Save for two prece- 
dents, I cannot conceive of any 
way in which this pulse could 
have been overlooked.” 

“Two precedents, sir?” said the 
tech, intrigued both by the un- 
suspected fallibility of the scan- 
ner and by this unusual loquacity 
from the zoologist. 

Jerry removed his gaze from 
the screen and regarded the 
young man standing beside it. He 
made as if to reply, then thought 
better of it. Any out-going on his 
part was an effort. A big effort. 
And a danger. Only another Space 
Zoologist would understand the 
danger of speech, of letting loose, 
of relaxing for a moment that 
terrible vigil over one’s personal 
psychic barricades. 

“Skip it,” he said abruptly. The 
young ensign’s smile tightened 
to obedience at the words. 

GALAXY 



“Yes, sir,” said the tech, with 
strained cordiality. “Will that be 
all, sir?” 

“Yes,” said Jerry. Then, as the 
tech started out of the compart- 
ment, “No, wait. Tell Ollie Gibbs 
in the Ward Room to bring up a 
pot of coffee. Black.” 

The man nodded, and went out 
the door, dogging it after him. 

Jerry listened to the booted 
feet clanking on their magnetic 
soles up the passageway of the 
spaceship, and sighed. 

The situation, in Jerry’s ex- 
perience, was fantastic. Only 
twice, in the history of Space 
Zoology, had there been over- 
sights on the part of the scanners. 
One, almost comically, had been 
on Earth, when the scanners were 
first being tested. The chunky 
roborocket — its angles and 
bulges and tapering pickup-heads 
unsuitable for flight in any me- 
dium but airless space — had 
swept giddily about the planet, 
the sensitive pickup-heads record- 
ing and filing on microtape the 
patterns of the life-pulses of all 
sentient life below. And when the 
tape had been translated onto the 
IBM cards, and the cards run 
through the translation chambers, 
to get their incomprehensible 
sine-patterns changed into read- 
able English, it was found that 
there was an animal missing. 

Six months of circling the 
planet had still left the index 

BIG BABY 




blank on that animal’s expected 
check-pattern. The animal was 
the brown bear, of north central 
America. And only after agon- 
izing hours of theorizing and 
worrying did someone come up 
with the answer to the dilemma: 

It had been a long, hard winter. 
The bears were in extended hi- 
bernation. Somehow, the fleeting 
flicker of their subdued life-pulses 
had never managed to correspond 
with the inquisitive sweep of the 
scanner-beams from the blackness 
of space overhead. And so, they’d 
been left off, as though they did 
not even exist. 

A lot of sweat was dabbed from 
relieved foreheads in the Corps 
when a secondary roborocket, 
sent into a short one-week orbit, 
had picked up the animals’ pulses 
with ease as soon as springtime 
was upon the land. The odds 
against their being thus missed 
were fantastic, astronomically 
unlikely. But it had happened, 
despite the odds against it, and 
the Corps was forcibly reminded 
that in a universe of planets, there 
is infinite room for even the un- 
likely to occur. 

The only other oversight had 
been years later, when a just- 
settling colony had been half-de- 
stroyed by a herd of immense 
beasts similar to the buffalo of 
Earth, but viciously carnivorous. 
There had been no indication, in 
the six-month, scanning period, 

95 ^ 



that such a species even existed 
on the planet, the third planet of 
Syrinx Gamma, the sun of a 
newly discovered system beyond 
the Coalsack. 

The reason was maddeningly 
simple. The herds were migratory. 
Their migrations had corre- 
sponded in scope around the 
oceanless planet with the sweep 
of the scanner-beam in such a way 
that the roborocket was scanning 
either where the herd had just 
been or where it had not yet ar- 
rived. Again, the odds were fan- 
tastic against the occurrence. Yet, 
again, it had happened. Other 
than these two events, though, 
there had been no further error 
on the part of scanners for nearly 
a decade. 

Precautions had been taken 
against recurrence. 

Roborockets were now sent to 
scan a planet only at a time when 
there would be an overlap of sea- 
sonal climes, so that the beam 
would inspect the surface through- 
out both the mild and the rig- 
orous weathers, thus obviating a 
repeat of the brown bear incident. 
And the sweep of the beam had 
been extended, so that no animal 
with migratory movement at 
speeds less than that of a super- 
sonic plane could have avoided 
being duly detected and cata- 
logued. That, they thought, should 
prevent any more such incidents. 

All that Jerry knew. 



A ND yet, here he was, descend- 
ing through the black 
vacuum of space toward an al- 
ready-colonized planet, the second 
planet of Sirius, a planet sup- 
posedly already scanned, cata- 
logued, and long-since ready for 
inhabitation. And now, after the 
colonials had been there for 
nearly five years, something was 
starting to wipe them out. Some 
unsuspected alien thing was 
present on the planet, a thing 
that a hastily lofted roborocket 
had located in a matter of hours, 
and yet had missed in its original 
six-month orbital check, before 
the settlers came. 

It was impossible. Incredible. 
And yet, again, it had happened 
— was happening — and had to 
be stopped. 

A frantic appeal had been 
beamed to Earth through sub- 
space, an appeal for a Space Zoo- 
logist to find the alien. Learn its 
weaknesses, and recommend its 
mode of destruction. 

“Some day,” Jerry mused, wait- 
ing impatiently for Ollie Gibbs 
with the coffee, “I’ll come upon 
an invincible alien. What recom- 
mendation then!” He could just 
imagine himself telling a second- 
generation village of hardshell 
settlers that they’d best just pack 
up and get out . 

Jerry’s ruminations were in- 
terrupted by the soft tap on the 
door that meant Ollie had arrived.

He grunted an answer, and the 
ship’s mess boy came in, his face 
rigid in an expression of polite 
decorum as he set the steaming 
pot and drab plastic cup down 
on the swing-out table at Jerry’s 
elbow. 

Jerry sensed the man’s eyes 
flickering onto him each time the 
mess boy felt the zoologist wasn’t 
looking his way. He finally turned 
and caught the youth in mid- 
stare. 

‘What is it, Ollie?” said Jerry, 
not unkindly. “You’ll burst if you 
don’t talk. Go ahead, spit it out.” 

Ollie flashed a brief grin, a daz- 
zle of white teeth that was all the 
brighter in his bronze face. “If 
I’m bursting with anything, sir, 
it’s just plain nosiness.” 

J ERRY glanced from Ollie to 
the wall clock — spaceship 
clocks were always set at Eastern 
Standard Earth Time — and 
sighed. He was cutting it terribly 
close this time. Suddenly, he 
wanted very much to have some- 
one to talk to. It didn’t matter, all 
at once, that he’d be exposing 
himself to danger by relaxing his 
mental grip on himself. If the 
ship were not landed and his job 
begun within two hours he’d be 
no worse off speaking than if he’d 
kept still. 

“Sit down, Ollie,” he said ab- 
ruptly. 

The mess boy’s eyebrows rose 



at this unheard-of request, but he 
perched obediently in a chair, al- 
most poised for flight on the edge 
of the seat. To have a chat with 
a Space Zoologist was without 
precedent in Ollie’s experience. 

Jerry carefully poured himself 
a cup of coffee, took a sip and 
settled back comfortably in his 
chair. “What’s on your mind, 
Ollie?” 

“Like I said, sir, just plain nosi- 
ness. I — I can’t get over you 
Learners, sir, that’s all. I always 
wonder what gets you into the 
business. Why you stay in it so 
long, why you die so quick if you 
quit the Corps, or — Well, like 
that, sir.” 

“Just general curiosity about 
my raison d’etre, huh?” said 
Jerry. He wasn’t trying to floor 
the mess boy with a four-dollar 
word; even the lowliest crewman 
on a spaceship had been chosen 
for brainpower, long before brawn 
came into consideration at all. 

“That’s about it, sir.” Ollie 
nodded. “I mean, I watch you, sir, 
when you come out on these trips. 
You get all keyed up and worried 
and sick-looking, and I keep won- 
dering, ‘Why does he do it? Why 
doesn’t he get out of it if it affects 
him like that?”’ 

Jerry stared ruefully at the 
wall before him, and didn’t meet 
the mess boy’s eyes as he replied. 

“Every man gets keyed up and 
scared when he has an important

jy. Space nerves or something of 
the sort, I guess.” 

“Sure, sir.” 

The mess boy turned and con- 
tinued down the passageway. 
Jerry shut the door slowly, then 
sat down in his chair once more. 



undertaking at hand. It’s just 
worry, plain and simple. The 
thought of failure keeps' me all 
tightened up.” 

Jerry paused, awaiting a re- 
sponse. When none was forth- 
coming, he turned his gaze slowly 
to meet that of the mess boy, 
hoping he was doing it casually 
enough to allay an3rthing like sus- 
picion in the other man. But the 
smile he met was, affectionately, 
the smile of a man who hasn’t 
been fooled. 

“That’s not it, sir,” said Ollie. 
“I know it’s not. Because you’re 
keyed up the wrong way. You’re 
keyed up with worry that you 
won’t have a job to do. Your big 
upset’s a lot like a — Well, like 
a junky waiting for his next 
fix ... If you’ll pardon the expres- 
sion, sir.” 

6iT will not pardon it!” Jerry 
bawled, then gripped the 
arms of his chair and shook his 
head in instant apology as the 
other man’s face went slack with 
surprise. “No, Ollie, no. I take 
that back. I asked you to sit 
there, told you to let me know 
what was on your mind. I can’t 
very well blow up just because 
you followed my lead.” 

“Everyone blows up, now and 
then, sir,” Ollie said. 

Jerry nodded glumly. 

Ollie got up. “I’ll be in the ward 
room, sir, if you need anything 



else,” he said. “Unless you’d like 
me to stick around awhile?” 

Jerry considered the offer, then 
shook his head. “No . I’d better 
not, Ollie.” The barest ghost of 
humof glowed a moment on the 
zoologist’s face. “You’re too 
damned easy to talk to.” 

“Yes, sir,” Ollie grinned, then 
went out and closed the door 
after him. 

Jerry sat in the chair a second 
longer, then jumped up and 
pulled the door open again. Ollie, 
a few steps down the passageway, 
turned about in curious surprise. 

“Sir?” 

“Tell Captain — ” Jerry began, 
then realized his voice was nearly 
a ragged shout, and lowered it. 
‘Would you please tell the cap- 
tain to speed things up if he can, 
Ollie?” 

Ollie hesitated. “The vec- 
tor — ” he started, then stiffened 
militarily and replied, “Yes, sir. 
At once, sir.” 

“No,” Jerry groaned, closing his 
eyes and hanging onto the metal 
edge of the doorframe. “Forget it. 
He’s got a course to follow in. He 
can’t get there any faster.” 

Ollie, knowing this already, 
just stood there'. 

“Just go have a cup of coffee,” 
Jerry added, lamely. “And about 
what I said — ” 

“You know I wouldn’t say any- 
thing about it, sir,” Ollie said. 

“I know,” Jerry admitted. “Sor-

cold needle-pricks of fear in every 
muscle and joint of his body.

rpHE colony on the second 
planet of Sirius existed 
solely due to one of those vicious 
circles of progress. Just as iron is 
needed to make the steel to build 
the tools and equipment neces- 
sary to mine the raw iron ore, so 
this colony was needed to mine 
the precious mineral that made 
such colonies possible in the first 
place. 

The mineral was called Praeso- 
dynimium, a polysyllabic mouth- 
ful which meant simply that it 
was an unstable crystalline iso- 
tope of sodium that broke down 
eventually into ordinary sodium 
(hence “prae-”:before; “sod-”:so- 
dium), which was possessed of 
extreme kinetic potentials 
(“dyn-”:power), and was first 
extracted from sodium com- 
pounds by a Canadian scientist 
( -imium” instead of the more 
American “-inum” or even “-um”). 
This crystal had the happy 

BIG BABY 



habit of electrical allergy. When 
subjected to even a mild electric 
current, it avoided the consequent 
shakeup of its electronic juxtapo- 
sition by simply vanishing from 
normal space until the power was 
turned off. The nice part about its 
disappearance — from an astro- 
naut’s point of view — was that 
the crystal took not only itself, 
but objects within a certain radius 
along with it. It turned out that 
a crystal of Praesodynimium the 
moderate size of a sixteen-inch 
softball would warp a ninety-foot 
spaceship into hyperspace with- 
out even breathing hard. Of 
course, it would warp anything 
else within a fifty-foot radius, too; 
so it was only turned on after the 
ship had ascended beyond planet- 
ary atmosphere, lest a large scoop 
of landing-field, not to mention a 
few members of the ground crew, 
be carried away with the ship. 

In her eagerness to investigate 
the now-attainable stars. Earth 
had soon exhausted her sources 
of the mineral. Worse, the crystal, 
being unstable, had a half-life of 
only twenty-five years. That 
meant that a ship using it had a 
full-range radial margin of about 
five years before the crystal 
ceased warping the ship-inclusive 
area. 

Until some way was discovered 
to get into hyperspace without 
using Praesodynimium — and its 
actual function was as much a 



98 



99 



mystery to scientists as an auto- 
mobile’s cause-and-effect is to a 
lot of drivers; very few people 
can describe the esoteric relation- 
ships between the turning of the 
ignition key and the turning of 
the rear wheels — the mineral 
was worth ten times its weight in 
uranium 235. 

Sirius II had been found to be 
as rife with the mineral as a 
candy store is with calories. 
Hence the colony. 

For so long as the ore held out 
the planet would be regarded 
with fond respect and esteem by 
any and all persons who had in- 
vestments, relatives or even just 
interest in the Space Age and its 
contingent programs. 

S O it was with considerable 
trepidation that Earth re- 
ceived the news that the mines 
on Sirius were no longer being 
worked. Oh, yes, there was still 
ore — enough to keep the planet 
profitable for another century. 
The trouble was the miners. They 
weren’t coming out of the mines 
anymore. And no one who went 
inside to look for them was ever 
seen again, either. 

Naturally, mining slacked off. 
The men refused to set foot in 
the mines until somebody found 
out what had happened to their 
predecessors. 

So the officials of the colony 
resurrected a scanner-beam and 



roborocket from the cellar of the 
spacefield warehouse and storage 
depot. They sent the rocket into 
an orbit matching planetary ro- 
tation. In effect it simply hovered 
over the mines while it scanned 
the area for uncatalogued alien 
life. 

And when they brought the 
rocket down and checked the 
microtape against the file of 
known species on the planet, they 
found that no such beast had ever 
been catalogued. Its life-pulse 
gave a reading of point-nine-nine- 
nine. 

Since lifepulses are catalogued 
on a decimal scale based on the 
numeral one (with Man rated at 
point-oh-five-oh), the colonial ad- 
ministration staff immediately 
ordered the mines officially closed 
and off-limits. This brought no 
results on Sirius II which had not 
been already achieved, but the 
declaration made the miners feel 
a little less guilty over their dere- 
liction of duty. 

An SOS was swiftly sent to 
Earth, explaining the situation in 
detail and requesting instructions. 

Earth sent word to hang on, 
keep calm and leave the mines 
closed until an investigation could 
be made — all of which the col- 
ony was trying to do anyway. 

A duplicate of the microtape 
had been transmitted along with 
the SOS. Earth had checked the 
pattern against every known spe- 

GALAXY 



cies filed in U.S. Naval Space 
Corps Alien-Contact Library, a 
collection of the vast alien multi- 
tude gathered by Space Zoolo- 
gists in the methodical coloniza- 
tion and exploration of the 
universe. It was found to be not 
only unknown anywhere in the 
thus-far-explored cosmos, but 
totally unlike any life-pulse pre- 
viously encountered. 

Earth decided the only way to 
get any satisfaction would be by 
the unorthodox method of send- 
ing in a Space Zoologist to Con- 
tact the alien, though this would 
be the first time in the history of 
Contact that this had ever been 
done on an already-settled planet. 

And so the badly frightened 
colony lingered behind bolted 
doors, and peered through locked 
windows at the sky — awaiting 
the arrival of Jerry Norcriss, and 
praying he’d locate the alien and 
tell them how it might be dealt 
with . 

egging your pardon, sir,” 
grinned the tech, doing 
some last-minute fiddling with the 
machine, “but you never had it 
so good.” Jerry dabbed at the 
cold sweat-film on his forehead 
and upper lip, and nodded 
silently. 

In all his previous Contacts, 
done before any colonization was 
even attempted, things were a bit 
more rustic. His present environs 

BIG BABY 




were luxury compared to those 
setups. If the six-month orbit of 
the roborocket found the planet 
safe for humans, well and good; 
Jerry did not have to go. But if 
a new life-form were spotted — 
one that did not correspond in 
life-pulse to any known species 
— then it was Jerry’s job to land 
on the planet and Learn the 
beast, to determine its probable 
menace, if any, to man. 

The tech was referring to the 
fact that Jerry’s usual base of 
operations was out on the sward 
beside the tailfin of the rocket, 
the only power-source on a non- 
colonized planet. There, in his 
Contact helmet, relaxed upon his 
padded couch, he would let his 
mind be sent right into that of the 
alien, to Learn it from the inside 
out. Here, though, on a settled 
world, his accommodations were 
pleasantly out of the ordinary. 
He was in the solarium of the 
town’s research laboratory-hospi- 
tal. He gazed up through quartz 
panes at soothing blue skies, in 
air-conditioned comfort spoiled 
only by a fugitive scent of disin- 
fectant lingering in the building. 

Some half-dozen curious mem- 
bers of the building’s staff were 
gathered in the room. None of 
them had ever seen a man go into 
Contact before. In vain the tech 
had assured them, before Jerr 3 r’s 
arrival, that there was nothing to 
be seen. Jerry would lie on the 



100 



101 



couch and adjust the helmet upon 
his head, and then the tech would 
throw a switch. And for forty 
minutes there would be nothing 
to see except Jerry’s silent supine 
body. 

Later, of course, the inforina- 
tion transmitted by Jerry’s mind 
through the helmet pickups to the 
machine would be translated into 
English. Then they could all read 
about the new animal. That 
would be the interesting part, for 
them; not this senseless staring 
at the young man, white-haired 
at thirty-plus, who would, so far 
as they’d be able to tell, merely 
doze off for an uneventful forty- 
minute nap. 

For Jerry, however, things 
would be anything but dull for 
those forty minutes. 

Once the process was begun, 
there was no way known even to 
the discoverer of the Contact 
principle to extend or reduce the 
time-period. When Jerry’s mind 
had traveled to that of the alien, 
he would remain there for the full 
time. Anything that happened to 
the alien in that period would also 
happen to Jerry. Including death. 

If the alien somehow perished 
with Jerry “aboard,” as it were, 
the group in the solarium would 
wait in vain for him ever to bestir 
himself and rise from the couch 
again. 

Jerry, fighting the waves of 
nausea that burned in the pit of 



his stomach, lay there in his hel- 
met and waited for the tech to , 
finish adjusting the machine. 

A scanner-beam, sent toward 
the suspected locale from the 
solarium, had instantly retrig- 
gered that same green blip in 
response, as jagged and powerful 
as before. Jerry would soon be 
sent right into the center of the 
response-area, and his mind im- 
bedded in the brain of the alien. 

“Hurry it up, will you?” Jerry 
called over to the tech, trying not 
to shout. 

“Ready, sir,” the other man 
said abruptly. “Are you all set?” 

“All set. Ensign,” Jerry replied, 
then shut his eyes to the clear 
blue sky and the stares of the 
curious and let his mind relax for 
the brief shock of transport . 

A flare of lightning, silent, 
white and cold in his mind — and 
Jerry Norcriss was in Contact . 

O NE of the nurses, crisp and 
efficient in white starched 
cotton, took a hesitant step to- 
ward the figure on the couch, 
then spoke to the tech without 
looking at him, intensely. “What 
are his chances? It’s so important 
that he succeed!” 

About to brush her off with a 
noncommittal reply, the tech 
turned his gaze from the control 
panel to meet, turning to face 
him, a pair of the deepest blue 
eyes he’d ever seen, and a smooth- 



102 



GALAXY 




skinned serious face beneath a 
short-cropped tangle of bright 
yellow hair. The eyes were 
troubled. His manner softened in- 
stantly. 

Trying not to show the sudden 
warmth he felt, he pointed with 
offhand authority at the tall 
metal machine, its face alive with 
leaping lights and quivering in- 
dicator needles. 

“This’ll tell the story, one way 
or the other,” he said. “A Space 
Zoologist’s chances are always 
fifty-fifty. He either succeeds and 
returns in perfect health, or he 
fails and doesn’t return at aU. 
But whatever data he picks up in 
Contact will be punched onto the 
microtape. It may help us deal 
with the menace. Or it may not. 

She looked surprised. “Then 
this is simply a recorder? I’d 
thought it was the thing that sent 
his mind out to the mine area . .” 
She faltered on the last few 
words, and looked more con- 
cerned than ever. 

The tech was tempted to ask 
her about it, but decided to stay 
on the neutral ground of simple 
mechanics for a while. “No, his 
mind sends itself. That is, the 
helmet triggers a certain brain- 
center; his mind follows a scan- 
ner-beam directed toward the 
alien and he Contacts. After that, 
this machine could be turned off, 
so far as maintaining Contact 
goes. After a forty-minute interim. 



his mind would return to his body 
by itself. The brain-center gets 
triggered sort of like a muscle re- 
acts to a blow. It gets paralyzed 
for a certain time. Forty minutes. 
Beyond that limit, or short of it, 
no Contact or breaking of Con- 
tact is possible . .” 

His voice trailed off as he real- 
ized her responsive nods were ab- 
stracted and vague, her thoughts 
elsewhere. “Look,” he said awk- 
wardly, “I’m no psyche-man, but 

maybe it’d help if you talked 

about it.” 

A faint smile touched her 
mouth. “I didn’t realize it 
showed.” 

He grinned and shrugged. 

“My name’s Jana,” she said. 
“Jana Corby.” She was trying to 
ease some of the natural tension 
between strangers. 

“Bob Ryder,” said the tech. 
He stood and waited for her to 
make the next move. 

“My father — ” she said, and 
for the first time, some of the ten- 
sion behind her eyes flowed over 
into her voice. “My father was 
one of the miners. He was on the 
morning shift. The day the men 
didn’t come home was the day 
before my wedding.” 

Bob frowned. “I don’t under- 
stand.” 

S HE blinked at the moisture 
that had come to her eyes, 
and flashed him a sad little smile.

GALAXY 



“I’m sorry. I was telescoping 
events. You see, with Dad miss- 
ing, I postponed the ceremony, 
naturally, till I could learn what 
had happened. Jim — that’s Jim 
Herrick, my fiance — was won- 
derfully understanding about it. 
He’s a miner, too. On the night- 
shift, thank God. But if Lieuten- 
ant Norcriss doesn’t succeed — 
if he can’t find a way to destroy 
this beast, whatever it is — we 
can’t get married, ever.” 

Bob shook his head slowly. 
“You can’t? I don’t follow.” 

“You’re in the Space Corps,” 
she said. “Maybe you don’t know 
about interstellar colonies. It 
costs plenty to send people to the 
stars. The investors want some 
kind of guarantees for their 
money. So we’re all signed to a 
ten-year contract. If we fail to 
fulfill the terms we’re sent back 
to Earth on the next ship going 
that way.” 

“Well — I know you’re still 
within the limit,” said Bob, “but 
how does this upset your mar- 
riage plans?” 

‘We go where we’re sent,” she 
said simply. “If this colony fails, 
we’ll be sent to a new planet. It 
may not be the same one. I’ll be 
sent where they need nurses, Jim 
where they need miners.” 

Bob felt funny, talking against 
the colonial program, but the 
weary despair in the girl’s eyes 
outweighed economic considera- 



tions. “You could both renege on 
your contracts.” 

“And go back to Earth to- 
gether?” Jana shook her head. “I 
couldn’t do that, for Jim’s sake. 
He’s spent his life at mining, and 
this is the kind of mining he 
knows best: Praesodynimium. 

And there just is no more on 
Earth.” 

“He could get something else,” 
said Bob. 

“I know. But he might not be 
happy. After a while, he might 
blame me for it. Or I’d blame my- 
self. Either way, things just 
wouldn’t be the same. I — I sup- 
pose you think I’m foolish, feeling 
so strongly about him?” 

Bob said softly, “Honey, any 
guy would cut his arm off to get 
a girl like you. Myself included.” 
Embarrassed, she looked once 
more toward the silent figure up- 
on the couch. “You’re very kind.” 
“Not kind,” said the tech. 
‘Wistful.” 

Behind them, a myriad banks 
of lights and switches flickered 
shifted with electric monotony, 
slowly recording the details, down 
to the most minute sensory 
awareness, of the Contact be- 
tween Jerry Norcriss and the 
alien . 

Ill 

^ I ■'HERE was at first the feeling 
of warm sunlight on his flesh, 
then a pimgent scent of crushed 



BIG BABY 



105 



foliage, green and heady very 
strong and familiar. 

As his mind took hold, a whis- 
per of wind hummed into his con- 
sciousness and a shimmering 
golden brightness began to grow 
upon his closed eyelids. Abruptly, 
unity of sensation was achieved. 
Jerry Norcriss “was” in a sunlit 
part of the woods near the mines, 
feeling the alien’s perceptions as 
though they were his own. 

He crinkled his eyes against 
the glare, then slowly opened 
them. 

As he blinked his eyes to focus 
the golden glare, he spotted a 
strange little cluster of tiny sticks, 
with miniature leaves sprouting 
greenly on thread-like branches. 
Halfway between his face and 
this fragile copse slithered a bril- 
liant blue line, ribbon-thin, 
through a serpentine gouge along 
the earth. On the far side of this 
trickle lay a rich tumble of soft 
green velvet, ending at a group 
of more of those twig-copses. 
Puzzled, Jerry turned his gaze 
skyward. Within the warm blue 
canopy overhead he saw clouds 
. but clouds unlike any he’d 
ever seen for size. None of them 
could have been more than a 
foot in diameter. They hung 
against the sky like cotton-cov- 
ered basketballs. 

He returned his gaze ground- 
ward, and for the first time saw 
the scuffed grayish area of earth 



between himself and the trickle. 
A wiry network of metal glittered 
there, the wires in pairs, and the 
pairs disappearing into small 
square punctures against a wall 
of banked soil. 

Then Jerry gasped. His mind 
had apprehended the implications 
of his vista so suddenly that he 
was staggered. 

All the facts sprang into proper 
perspective. The twigs were ac- 
tually tall trees, the tumble of 
velvet a wide stretch of grassy 
sward, the trickle was a rushing 
blue river, and the tiny wire-net- 
work in the grayish area was the 
tracks for the mine-cars, leading 
down into the planet through 
those tiny square adits. 

Jerry had unconsciously been 
receiving sensations in terms of 
his host’s size. A quick calculation 
showed him that his head must 
be easily five hundred feet in the 
air. 

Cautiously, he glanced for the 
first time toward the body of his 
host, to see what sort of creature 
he was in Contact with. 

There was nothing whatever to 
be seen. 

Yet when he closed his eyelids 
once again, golden opacity re- 
turned. He reopened them 
thoughtfully. The alien, appar- 
ently, could cut off its vision. Yet 
the eyes of a creature so high 
must be many feet in diameter. 
And, at this height, twin opacities 



106 



GALAXY 



would be spotted even from the 
nearby town. 

But so such sight had been re- 
ported. Therefore, the lids were 
opaque only from the inside. 
Which was ridiculous. Yet it was 
happening. 

Jerry’s thoughts were interrup- 
ted by a giddy realization. He, in 
this alien body, was not standing. 
He was seated cross-legged on 
the ground. That meant a height 
of not five hundred feet, but 
nearer seven hundred. 

^AUTIOUSLY, he extended a 
hand toward one of the tiny 
mine-cars. He had a little diffi- 
culty directing a hand and arm 
he could not see; but, by feeling 
along the earth, he got hold of the 
dull gray object and tried to lift 
it. It came up with featherweight 
ease. 

Then, halfway to his eyes, it 
began to glow, to smoke, to grow 
terribly hot. And as Jerry re- 
leased it with a reflex of pain, it 
biust into white flame and hit the 
ground as a shapeless gobbet of 
molten slag. Jerry’s hand came to 
his mouth automatically. He 
sucked and licked at the sore sur- 
faces of his finger and thumb, 
trying to drain some of the hurt 
out of them. 

Then he froze. 

After a heartbeat, he felt care- 
fully about the interior of his 
mouth with a forefinger. Gums. 



Warm, wet, soft-boned toothless 
gums. Whatever the alien looked 
like — it was still only a baby. 

Which meant — 

Quickly Jerry looked at the 
sky again. Not a cloud had 
moved. Their rotund fleeciness 
might have been carven there. 
He gave himself a mental kick. 
Hadn’t one of his first alien 
awarenesses been the sound of 
wind? And yet the grass lay still. 
The trees stood silent. And the 
clouds, so nearly over his head 
that he could have touched one, 
hung quietly against a perfectly 
calm sky. 

It was not the wind he had 
heard. It was air. Just molecules 
of air, as they shifted and flew 
about at incredible speeds. 

The alien-baby’s time-sense 
was occluded, as that of any 
Earth-baby, by shortness of life. 
It was the paradox of relative 
lifetime. 

A lifetime. Old Peters had said, 
training the eager young men who 
were to become graduate Space 
Zoologists, is a lifetime. He’d 
written it on the blackboard so 
they might understand he was 
not speaking in circles. 

“A lifetime,” he’d said, “is the 
time one spends from birth until 
any present moment. A lifetime 
is the actual count of moments 
of existence from birth. When a 
baby has been born for an hour, 
its lifetime is sixty minutes. And 



BIG BABY 



107 



to the baby, that sixty minutes is 
a lifetime.” 

He’d written the two words on 
the board, and would point from 
one to the other as he spoke, so 
the class could understand the 
distinction visually, and not have 
to rely on his inflection to tell 
which term he’d used. 

“A lifetime,” he’d continued, 
“is subjective; a lifetime is objec- 
tive. The first deals in one’s per- 
sonal sense of time passed. The 
second is simply readings from a 
clock. When a man turns ninety, 
he is usually surprised to find how 
short a life he’s seemed to have 
had. His ninety years seem hardly 
longer to him than a single day 
seemed when he was a baby. 

“It is a lucky thing that we can- 
not penetrate the mind of an in- 
telligent creature. If any of us 
got into the mind of a baby, we’d 
soon start going out of our minds 
with the maddening length of a 
day’s time, seen from a baby’s 
viewpoint. Remember, when you 
are in Contact with an alien mind, 
for that immutable forty minutes 
your sensation of elapsed time 
will be subject to that of your 
host. To a baby, forty minutes is 
forever.” 

A ND here Jerry Norcriss was, 
in a baby’s mind. 

No wonder no tree had rippled, 
no cloud had blown. The baby- 
senses were geared to a near-eter- 



nal forty minutes. For all prac- 
ical purposes, Jerry was stuck in 
one frame of a movie 
trapped for who-knows-how-long 
till the next frame came by. 

“That’s why the car melted!” 
he realized. “The movement of 
the car toward me, in my hand, 
must have been infinitely shorter 
than the few seconds it seemed 
to take. I tried to make the mine 
car move more than five hundred 
feet, in an actual time less than 
a thousandth of a second!” 

Jerry wasn’t overly concerned 
about the duration itself. He’d 
been in subjectively-slow crea- 
tures before. If things got too bor- 
ing, he could always doze off; that 
usually served to pass the time. 
Even a baby’s time-sense jumps 
long gaps when it sleeps. 

The thing that puzzled him 
was this: If the rhine car had 
burnt up from moving too far too 
fast, why hadn’t the baby’s hand 
and arm been scorched by the 
motion? The heat of the car had 
affected it, so that let out inborn 
heat-resistance. 

His hands once again went to 
his face. He felt not only the 
features — familiar features, 
eerily like a human babsr’s — 
but the skull-size. When he’d fin- 
ished, he no longer had reason to 
doubt that the baby was of an 
intelligent- species. Too much 
cranial allotment to think any 
differently. 



.108 



GALAXY 



The whole situation, Jerry 
mused with grim humor, was 
screwy. The six-month roborocket 
could not have missed a creature 
with such an intense life-pulse, 
but it had. Contact could not be 
achieved with an intelligent mind, 
but it had been. Invisibility — 
except for certain species of un- 
derwaters creatures — was sup- 
posed- to be impossible for a liv- 
ing organism. Yet here it was. 

Three separate impossibles . 
all accomplished. 

“Still,” said Jerry to himself, 
“that’s not the main puzzle. The 
vanishing of those two shifts of 
miners is still beyond me. They 
could, of course, have simply 
walked head-on into this invisible 
leviathan. But how fast can a 
man walk? And would they all 
have done it? Now, if this kid 
happened to pick one of them 
up — ” Jerry gave a shudder at 
the thought of what had hap- 
pened to that metal mine car. 
“Still,” he sighed, baffled, “a man 
who bursts into flame is no more 
fun to hold than a hot mine car. 
After maybe two or three deaths 
at the outside, the kid would’ve 
learned not to touch them.” 

Then he had an even eerier 
thought. If this creature were a 
baby — where did its mother and 
father lurk? 

The thought of two more in- 
visible giants at large on the 
planet was unbearable. 



RRY decided to chance loos- 
ing control over the alien 
mind, to let its own instincts come 
to the fore. 

There was' the possibility that 
it knew where its folks were, and 
would try moving in that direc- 
tion. Or it might cry for its 
mother, and she’d hurry back. If 
there were invisible giants, the 
sooner the colony was informed 
the better. 

As Jerry’s control of his host 
grew tenuous, he could feel the 
baby’s mind taking over once 
again. Feeble pulsations reached 
him — nothing like solid thought, 
but mere urgencies about com- 
fort, food and affection. 

Jerry waited, in the back- 
ground of the unformed mind, for 
something to happen. Then, sud- 
denly, there was a shifting, 
something like a metal earth- 
quake. A cold hard light of 
awareness focused on him, where 
he’d thought he was safely hidden 
in the background. 

“Who are you?” asked the 
awareness. 

It is not in so many words, of 
course. A mind speaks to another 
mind in incredibly swift short- 
hand. The actual thought-impulse 
that came to Jerry was a thick 
wave of curiosity, its stress laid 
upon identity. 

“I am a Learner,” Jerry’s 
thought replied. It was a self-suf- 
ficient response, since Jerry’s 




BIG BABY 



109 



concept of all that a Learner was 
was incorporated in the thought. 

“I see,” said the alien. “You 
have memories of antagonism 
which are now gone from your 

intent. Explain.” 

“I came to find a menace. I 
found a helpless child.” 

“I see,” came the cold, thought- 
ful reply. “Yes, that is how I 
sensed it.” 

“Is your mother around? 
asked Jerry. “Or father?” 

“Dead,” said the awareness. I 
am alone.” 

At the thought, the intense 
thought of loneliness, a kindred 
spark flared in Jerry’s own mind. 
The alien caught at the spark, 
recognized it. 

“Strange,” it said. “Y ou, too, are 
alone. But it is a different alone- 

ness.” . 

Jerry’s thoughts were whirling 
in confusion. To be read so easily 
by a baby was incredible to him. 
Yet the situation was without 
precedent. Perhaps a baby’s mind 
was brighter than science gave 
credit. Since a mind needed no 
words or manual skills, the mind 
of a baby might be open to learn 
the thousand things necessary for 
adult survival. Maybe as a man 
learned to use his body, he forgot 
in proportion how to use his mind. 

“How can you know my alone- 
ness?” asked Jerry. 

“I see it, there in your mind. It 
is plain to me. You have been 



misled. You are a helpless pawn 
of a singularly wicked scheme. 
The victim of a lie.” 

TERRY’S recollection flashed to 
J his conversation with Ollie 
Gibbs, to the things he had 
wanted to tell the other man but 
was unable to put into words. All 
the heaviness he had borne alone 
these many years was apparent 
to this mind he enhosted. The 
alien mind knew. Knew! 

“I see,” it said again, though 
Jerry was unaware of expressing 
any conscious thought. “It is clear 
to me now. You have suffered 
much — will suffer much. No 
hope for you, is there?” 

There was warmth in the words 
— warmth, friendship and com- 
passionate understanding. Sud- 
denly, to this mind of an alien in 
its incongruous, invisible baby’s 
body, Jerry found himself blurt- 
ing the things he had never told 
to any man. Things which no 
Space Zoologist had ever dis- 
cussed even with another member 
of that hapless clan. 

“They never told us,” he said 
to the alien. “I don’t hold any 
rancor because of it; they dared 
not tell us, lest we refuse to be- 
come one with them. They were 
fair, though. Long before we were 
indoctrinated, long before we’d 
been allowed to attempt our first 
Contact, we were told that there 
were dangers. Not the dangers we 



no 



GALAXY 



had heard about, such as the 
imminent peril of dying if the 
host died while we were in Con- 
tact. Another danger was implied, 
one which we could only learn of 
by actually becoming Learners, 
and one which — once we had 
learned of it — would be impos- 
sible to escape. 

“With a little thought along the 
proper lines, we might almost 
have guessed it. For every action, 
there is an equal and opposite re- 
action. One of Newton’s laws, ap- 
plied in an area he did not even 
suspect existed. 

“Oh, we were a brave, adven- 
turous lot, all of us. We would be 
Learners; no alien mind but we 
could enter it, and actually be- 
come the alien for the period of 
Contact. Thrills, danger and 
hairsbreadth escapes would be 
ours. Ultimate adventurers, they 
called us. And all along, we were 
fools.” 

The alien refrained from com- 
ment, although Jerry could feel 
its mind waiting, listening, assimi- 
lating. 

“Contact had a drawback. A 
basic one which we might have 
guessed, if we hadn’t been going 
around with stars in our eyes and 
a delightful feeling of superiority 
over the men who ^rould never 
know the interior on any minds 
but their own. In Contact, just as 
in simbathing, there is a delayed 
reaction, a kickback.” 



“Sunbathing?” thought the 
alien. 

Jerry’s mind swiftly opened for 
the alien’s inspection his full 
storehouse of information on the 
subject. In an instant, the alien 
apprehended the fate that lay in 
wait for the careless Space Zoo- 
logist — 

44^URE IS warm in here,” said 

^Bob, running a finger around 
inside his sweat-dampened uni- 
form collar. 

“You have to be careful,” said 
Jana, indicating the quartz panes 
that formed the ceiling and three 
walls of the solarium. “The quartz 
passes ultraviolet, unlike glass. 
You can pick up a severe burn if 
you sit out here too long without 
some sort of protection for your 
skin.” 

The tech nodded. “The insid- 
ious thing about sunburn is that 
you only turn a little pink as long 
as you’re out in the sunlight. It’s 
when you’ve gone indoors, or the 
sun has set, or you put your 
clothes back on that the red-hot 
bum begins to show up on your 
flesh.” 

“It’s the light-pressure,” said 
Jana. “As long as there’s an influx 
of ultraviolet, the flesh continues 
to absorb it without showing 
much reaction. But as soon as you 
get away from the rays — the 
bums show up ... I wonder how 
Norcriss is making out.

mean, then,” said the 
^ alien to Jerry, “that all the 
experiences you undergo in Con- 
tact are held back under the sur- 
face of your mind, waiting there 
until you let up on the incoming 
Contact experiences?” 

‘That’s it,” said Jerry, miser- 
ably. “In some of my Contacts, 
I’ve undergone pretty painful 
experiences. I’ve had an eye 
twisted out, an arm eaten and 
digested, been poisoned, nearly 
strangled — you name a near- 
death; I’ve been through it.” 

“And your reaction?” thought 
the mind. 

“Nil,” said Jerry, ruefully. 
“When I awakened from a Con- 
tact, my memory of my experi- 
ences was strictly a mental one. 
Like something I’d read in a 
book. There was no emotional 
reaction whatsoever. My heart 
beat its normal amount, my 
glands excreted normal perspira- 
tion, my muscles were relaxed. 
Not a trace of shock or any other 
after effect.” 

“And later?” the mind asked 
gently. 

“Back on Earth,” said Jerry, 
“the Space Zoologists have a 
thing we call the Comprehension 
Chamber. It’s a room filled with 
couches and helmets, in which we 
can listen — through replayed 
microtapes — to all the Contacts 



our confreres have ever made. 
Perhaps ‘listen’ is a weak word. 
For all practical purposes, we are 
in Contact, so long as the tape 
runs. I thought this room was a 
wonderful adjunct to my educa- 
tion, but nothing more. I went 
there a lot at first. It was even 
more fun than the real thing be- 
cause there was no danger of 
perishing. Tapes of zoologists who 
died while in Contact are never 
used in the Chamber.” 

The mind waited, listening 
patiently. 

“So one week — ” Jerry’s mind 
gave a' mental twinge akin to a 
physical shudder — “one week I 
got bored. I decided not to go to 
the Comprehensive Chamber. I 
went out on a few dates, instead. 
Tennis, the movies, like that. And 
on the third day, I woke in the 
morning with a heart trying to 
pound its way through my ribs, 
with my bedsheets dripping with 
cold .perspiration, and lancing 
agony in my eye, my hand 
knotted into a fist of pain, lungs 
burning for air . .” 

“Delayed reaction,” said the 
mind. 

“Yes,” said Jerry. “That was it. 
I recognized the pains right away, 
having been through them per- 
sonally in Contact only a month 
before them. I had a horrible 
inkling of what was occurring. I 
called the medics at Space Corps 
Headquarters before I passed out. 



T They came, shot me full of mor- 
phine and stuck me into a helmet 
for twenty-four hours straight, to 
cram my reactive agonies back 
beneath an overload of vicarious 
Contacts. It worked pretty well. 
The pain was' gone when I 
awakened. But my nerves weren’t 
the same afterward. I used to look 
forward to Contacts because I en- 
joyed them. Now I look forward 
to them because I dread what will 
happen if I don’t have another 
one in time.” 

“In time?” 

44T FIND that I must get to a 
Contact — real or vicarious 
— at least once in forty-eight 
hours. I’Ve been trapped by my 
job. I’m doomed to do this job or 
die horribly. Some men, desperate 
for escape from this treadmill, 
have quit the Corps, tried to bat- 
tle this kickback-effect. None of 
them have made it. They were 
found, all of them, in various 
states of agony. Dead, broken, 
burnt, tom . .” 

“Psychosomatic pressures?” 
asked the mind. 

“Yes. Their minds, overborne 
by their emotions, self-hypnotized 
them into re-undergoing their ex- 
periences. And their bodies, 
duped by their minds, reacted. 
On a normal man, a hypnotically 
suggested burn can raise an actual 
blister. On a man who’s opened 
his mind to the Contact-power — 



his body can break, burn, dissolve 
or even evaporate.’” 

“Poor Jerry,” said the alien 
mind, soothingly. A tingle formed 
slowly in Jerry’s mind, a growing 
warmth, a vibration of utter af- 
fection. He was being consoled, 
being loved by the alien. It knew 
his troubles. It understood the 
sorrow of his life. It wanted only 
to keep him close, to tell him not 
to be afraid, to make him happy, 
comfortable, safe . Safe, and 
secure, and — 

The glare of silent lightning 
leaped through Jerry’s conscious- 
ness, jerking him back from the 
unnervingly delightful torpor 
he’d been letting overcome his 
thoughts. 

Something hard bumped 
against his forehead. He realized 
that he’d just sat up on the couch, 
knocking the helmet from his 
head with the shock of the break- 
ing Contact. 

“Sir!” said the tech, pausing 
only to snap off the circuit switch 
before dashing to his side. “What 
the hell happened? I never saw 
you break Contact like that! Did 
you see the alien? Can it be de- 
stroyed?” 

Jerry groaned, tried to speak, 
then fell back onto the thick pad- 
ding, unconscious. 

“What’s the matter with him?” 
cried Jana, sensing the fright in 
the tech’s attitude. 

“I don’t know,” he whispered. 



112

BIG BABY 



113 



“I’ve never seen him act this way 
before. Whatever’s out there, it’s 
unlike anything we’ve ever en- 
countered before! Here, you get 
some of your medics up here to 
see to him. I’m going to process 
this damned tape and see what’s 
what!” 

Her face pale, Jana hurried 
off to do his bidding. The tech 
began to reset the machine so that 
the coded information on the tape 
might be translated into legible 
words. 

And Jerry Norcriss lay on the 
couch, sobbing and groaning like 
a man on the rack, although his 
mind was blanked by merciful un- 
consciousness. 

A baby?” choked the tech. 

“That thing out there is a 

baby?” 

“Does the tajje ever lie?” sighed 
Jerry, relaxing against the plump 
white pillows Jana had arranged 
under his back and shoulders. 

“Well, no,” faltered the tech. 
“But a baby! Five hundred feet 
high — and invisible — and able 
to carry on an intelligent conver- 
sation?” 

“Which reminds me,” said 
Jerry, sternly. “I am going to ask 
you to edit both the tape and that 
typewritten translation of that 
conversation. It’s just as well too 
many people don’t get the inside 
story on my job, and its rather 
rugged drawback. And as for 



yourself. Well, I can’t order you 
to forget what you’ve read there.” 
“I won’t talk about it, sir, if 
that’s what you mean,” said the 
tech. “It’s not such a hard secret 
to keep. All the crewman on the 
ship know there’s something 
pretty awful about yotir job. I 
just happen to know what. All I’d 
get for spilling the inside dope 
would be, ‘Oh, is that what it is!’ 
Hardly worth it.” 

“That’s hardly a noble reason 
to keep a secret,” Jerry mur- 
mured, looking narrow-eyed at 
the tech. 

The man grinned, then shrug- 
ged. “Makes my life easy, too. 
Now when you flare up at me. I’ll 
know why, and skip it.” 

“Thanks a hell of a lot,” Jerry 
muttered. 

The tech laughed aloud. 

“But,” the zoologist added so- 
berly, “we did learn one surprising 
lesson today. The forty-minute 
Contact period can be broken, 
under certain stresses.” 

The smile left the tech’s face, 
and he looked earnestly puzzled. 
“I don’t follow you, sir. There was 
nothing on the tape about — ” 
“Tape?” said Jerry. “You saw 
how quickly I came out, didn’t 
you? What’s that got to do with 
the tape?” 

“Sir,” the tech said hesitantly, 
“you were under the helmet for 
the full forty.” 

Jerry flopped back upon the 



114 



GALAXY 



pillows, staring at the other man 
as if he’d suddenly gone berserk. 
“That can’t be,” he said slowly. “I 
was in a long-life host. The clouds 
weren’t even moving. That baby 
was living many subjective days 
in the forty-minute period.” 
“Begging your pardon, sir,” said 
the tech, “but you must be mis- 
taken. You were gone the full 
forty.” 

“That’s impossible,” said Jerry. 
Jana, who’d been standing back 
from the two men, stepped for- 
ward cautiously, apprehensive at 
butting into something that was 
not really her affair. 

“Excuse me. Lieutenant Nor- 
criss,” she said softly, “but Bob’s 
right. You were gone as long as 
he says.” 

“You don’t understand, either 
of you!” Jerry snapped. “My time- 
awareness in a host is subject to 
the host’s time-awareness. So far 
as this host was concerned, a day 
was a confoundedly long period. 
But I could tell the elapsed time 
by watching the clouds, the height 
of the sun. They didn’t move, 
either of them, visibly . .” 

“How’s that again, sir? asked 
the tech. “How long did you seem 
to spend?” 

“Possibly an hour.” 

‘Well, then.” The tech shrug- 
ged. 

“But this had nothing to do 
with the host’s subjective sense 
of time, Ensign. It was my own 



knowledge of objective time 
through watching the sun, the 
trees, the clouds. None of them 
moved during my subjective hour 
in the host-alien. So no time — 
or very little time; barely a few 
minutes — could have passed 
while I was enhosted, do you 
see?” 

“Lieutenant Norcriss,” said 
Jana, abruptly. “I’m sorry to in- 
terrupt, but did you say clouds?” 

“Yes,” said Jerry, puzzled by 
her intensity. “Why?” 

“There hasn’t been a cloud in 
the sky today,” she said awk- 
wardly. “I mean — Well, look for 
yourself!” 

Jerry turned his gaze upward 
through the quartz ceiling of the 
solarium. The sky, a fich tur- 
quoise, was smooth and unbroken 
save for the glaring gold orb of 
the sun, Sirius. He sat up then, 
looking out through the likewise 
transparent walls. As far as he 
could see, over storetops, cottage 
roofs, and distant green glades, 
the sky was that same unbroken 
blue. 

“But that’s crazy!” he said, 
siiiking back against the pillows. 
“It couldn’t have been like that 
all the time I was in Contact. 
Could it?” 

Jana and Bob exchanged an 
uncomfortable look. 

‘Well, sir,” the tech said, “we 
weren’t exactly watching the sky, 
if you know what I mean. But it 



BIG BABY 



115 



was clear when you went into 
Contact. And it’s clear now.” 

His voice trailed off, uncer- 
tainly, but Jerry gave a slow 
thoughtful nod. “You’re right. 
Ensign. It is, and it was. The like- 
lihood of its clouding up for forty 
minutes, and then clearing again 
is so ridiculous I can’t even con- 
sider it . And yet, I saw — ” 

Jerry stopped speaking, and 
shook his head. Then he waved 
a hand at the tech, abstractedly. 
“Get me some coffee. Ensign. I 
have to think, hard.” 

■^jf/TIEN nightfall had cloaked 
” the planet in dark purple 
folds, Jerry was still gazing in- 
tently at nothingness, racking his 
brain for an answer. Bob, mean- 
time, had checked the card 
against the ship’s files on dealing 
with alien menaces, and had 
found — much as both he and 
Jerry had suspected — that there 
was no recommendation avail- 
able. The menace was new. It 
would have to be approached 
strictly ad libidum. Whatever 
method served to rid the planet 
of the menace would then, not 
before, be incorporated into the 
electronic memory of the brain on 
the ship, to serve future colonies 
who might meet a similar alien 
species. 

“Any ideas, sir?” asked the 
tech, after a long silence from his 
superior. 



“None,” Jerry admitted, not 
turning his head. “It’s pretty 
damned difficult to find a solution 
to a problem until you’re sure 
what the problem is.” 

“Well,” said the tech, “we 
played the radar all over the area 
where the tape said the thing was 
located. We got nothing. Maybe 
the kid’s mother came back.” 
“Just a second — ” said Jerry. 
“Ensign, could you rig the ma- 
chine to give us, not a written 
transcript of that alien’s descrip- 
tion, but a drawing of it?” 

“Jeepers, sir!” choked the tech, 
taken aback. “I don’t know. I’d 
have to talk with the engineers.” 
“It should be possible. Hell, it’s 
got to be. When I was enhosted, 
my mind transmitted back every 
bit of info on that body. A man 
who only knew mechanical draw- 
ing could sketch that shape, sim- 
ply by following the measurement 
specifications as my mind re- 
corded them. Go on. Ensign, get 
with it. One way or the other, I 
want a look at what we’re dealing 
with.” 

It was nearly midnight when 
Bob shook Jerry gently awake 
and handed him a small glossy 
rectangle of paper. 

Jerry, blinking his eyes against 
the sudden onslaught of light in 
the room as the tech threw the 
wall switch, stared blearily at the 
paper for a moment, blank and 
disoriented.

“It’s the picture, sir,” Bob said, 
recognizing the bafflement on his 
superior’s face for what it was. “I 
finally had the bright idea of turn- 
ing the problem over to the brain, 
aboard the ship. It followed the 
specifications from the tape by 
drawing the picture in periods.” 
“In what periods?” Jerry mum- 
bled, still trying to come awake. 

“Not time-periods, sir. Pimctu- 
ation. Then, when it had the thing 
done, on a ten-by-fourteen-inch 
sheet of feed-paper from its roller, 
I had the ship’s photographer 
take a snapshot and reduce it in 
size, so it looks at least as good 
as the average newspaper half- 
tone job.” 

Jerry nodded, absorbing the in- 
•formation even as his eyes crept 
over the image in his hands. 
“Looks strangely familiar,” he 
said, studying it closely. 

“If you’ll pardon what soimds 
like a gag, sir,” began the tech, “I 
think that the picture — in fact, 
we all think — ” 

“Yes?” said Jerry, looking at 
the man. 

“Well, the consensus among the 
crew was that this baby here looks 
a hell of a lot like you, sir.” 

Jerry sat where he was, his eyes 
on Bob’s face, for a long moment, 
as fingers of ice took hold of his 
spine. Then, with unreasoning ap- 
prehension, he turned his gaze 
back upon the near-photographic 
likeness he held. “Ensign,” he said. 



after a minute. “This is a picture 
of me.” 

“But sir, it can’t be,” said the 
tech. 

“You’re wrong,” said Jerry, let- 
ting the paper drop to the floor. 
“It can be, because it is. And all 
at once I think I know why.” 
Without warning, Jerry swung , 
his legs over the side of the couch 
and jumped to his feet. 

“Listen,” he said urgently, 
“there’s no time to lose. Get the 
hospital staff together, fast, and 
bring me back their best psyche- 
man. I need a hs^pnotist.” 

“A h-hyp — ?” the tech blurted, 
confused, then gave an obedient 
nod and hurried out, shaking his 
head all the way to the switch- 
board. 

ttlVrEVER mind why. Doctor. 

’ Can you do it? That’s all 
I care to knew,” Jerry’s voice 
crackled, his eyes flashing with 
authority. 

“Y-Yes, I think so,” quavered 
the other man. “If you can be 
hypnotized, I mean.” 

“All Space Zoologists have the 
brainpower necessary to be per- 
fect subjects,” Jerry snapped. 
“Quickly, now, Doctor. I’ve 
wasted one Contact already.” 
“Very well, sir,” said the man. 
“If you’ll lie back, now, and make 
your mind blank — ” 

“I know, I know! Get on with 
it, will you!” 



BIG BABY

Bob and Jana stood back in the 
shadows beside the towering met- 
al control board, listening in 
silence as the hypnotist put Jerry 
under, deeper and deeper, until 
his mind was readily suggestible. 
Then he made the statements 
Jerry had told him to make, and 
with a snap of his fingers brought 
the zoologist out of hypnosis. 

“You heard. Ensign?” asked 
Jerry. “Did he do exactly as I 
tbld him to?” 

“Sir!” protested the doctor. 

“I mean no offense,” said Jerry. 
“But if your words left my mind 
too free, too human somehow, the 
alien would sense it. And a ruse 
like this one might not work on 
a second attempt, once the alien 
had been apprised of our intent.” 
“He did, sir,” said Bob. “Word 
for word, as you told it to him.” 
“Good,” Jerry said. “Thank you. 
Doctor. And good night.” 

«Uh — yes,” said the man, 
finally realizing he was being per- 
emptorily dismissed after coming 
all the way across the town from 
his warm bed in the black morn- 
ing hours. “Good night to you, 

» 

Sir. 

H e fumbled his way out the 
door, and Jana, after a glance 
at Bob, shut it after him. Bob 
stood beside the control board, 
waiting as Jerry once more ad- 
justed the helmet upon his head 
and lay back on the couch. 



“All right?” he called to the 
tech, as Jana, now walking ner- 
vously on tiptoe, though there’d 
been no injunction against noise, 
hurried to Bob’s side and took his 
arm. 

“Ready, sir,” Bob said, keeping 
his voice steady. 

“You’ve set the stopwatch?” 
warned Jerry. 

“I depress the starter the same 
instant I turn on the machine,” 
said Bob. 

“All right, then,” said Jerry. 

Bob’s right hand threw a 
switch. 

Even as it snapped home, his 
left thumb had jabbed down upon 
the stopwatch button. The long 
red sweephand began clicking 
with relentless eagerness about 
the dial. 

On the couch Jerry stiffened, 
then relaxed. 

“You’d better stay with him,” 
Bob cautioned Jana. “The ma- 
chine’s on automatic. If I’m not 
back on time, it’ll take care of 
itself.” 

“Back on time?” she gasped. 
“But you can’t be. Bob. If what 
he said about the timing — ” 

Bob shut his eyes and gripped 
his forehead between thumb and 
fingers. “Yes, of course. I’m being 
an idiot. This maneuver is some- 
thing new. But — ” he withdrew 
his hand from his face and smiled 
at the girl — “you stay with him 
anyhow. I’d feel better — safer 



118 



GALAXY 



— if you weren’t with me and the 
others.” 

“Yes, Bob,” she said, in a faint 
shadow of her normal voice. “Be 
careful.” 

Bob grinned with more confi- 
dence than he felt, turned and 
hurried from the room. 

Jana moved slowly across the 
floor to the couch where Jerry 
Norcriss lay in unnatural slumber, 
and stood staring down at his 
strange, young-old face, and her 
eyes were bright with quiet won- 
der . 

V 

;4TI^AT’S this, what’s this?” 
** rasped Jerry’s mind. 
“Where have I gotten to, now?” 

“It’s all right,” said a soothing 
voice. “You’re with me, now.” 

“Oh? Oh?” Jerry’s mind said, 
snickering. “And who might you 
be?” 

It was dark as he looked out 
through the alien eyes, but a 
quick patting of his paw across 
his face reassured him that his 
sharp white incisors, muzzle and 
stiff gray whiskers were intact and 
healthy. 

“How can I be you?” asked 
Jerry. “If I’m a gray rat and 
you’re a gray rat, what am I doing 
here?” 

“You’ve come to spy on me, I 
know,” said the soothing voice. 
“But see? You have nothing to 



fear, nothing at all. I’m not going 
to htirt you. You find no menace 
in me. Do you?” 

“No. No menace. No danger. 
I’m safe, I’m secure, I’m warm 
and loved ...” 

“Relax,” said the alien. “Relax, 
and let. me have full control again. 
You can sleep if you do. You can 
rest. I’ll take care of you, thrust 
in that.” 

“Yes. Sleep. Rest. No more 
running, hiding, fearing . .” said 
Jerry Norcriss, the gray rat-mind 
in the invisible body of another 
rat much like himself . 

“Come on with that flashlight, 
damn it!” Bob raged, leading the 
other three crewmen through the 
woods. Two of them carried rifles, 
one had a flamethrower, and Bob 
himself carried one of the new 
bazookas with a potent short- 
range atomic warhead. Ollie, the 
man with the light, hurried up to 
him with a quick apology. 

“Okay, okay,” Bob said. “But 
I’ve got to see this dial — Ah, 
yes. This is the way, all right. 
Come on. Ollie, keep that beam 
so it spills on the tracking-cone 
dial as well as on the earth. We 
don’t dare risk losing our way. 
There are only seven minutes left 
until Contact is broken.” 

“Yes, sir. I’ll keep it right on 
there,” Ollie said. “But about the 
lieutenant — are you sure he 
won’t — ” 



BIG BABY 



119 



“That’s what the stopwatch is 
for. We must strike just as Con- 
tact is being broken. Any sooner, 
and we kill Lieutenant "Norcriss 
with the alien. Any later, and the 
alien kills us. The same -way it 
did the others who came upon it.” 
“But what does it do? What 
does it look like?” Ollie persisted. 

“Damn it, there’s no time to 
talk now! Just keep that light 
steady, and hurry!” 

The men plunged onward 
through the woods, the white cir- 
cle of light from the arc-torch 
splashing the cold leaves and 
damp, colorless grass with sickly, 
stark illumination. 

46TF YOU would only release 
■^your hold,” the alien was say- 
ing. Then its mind-voice stopped. 

Jerry, too, had seen the danc- 
ing white freckles that spattered 
the boles and branches of the 
nearby trees. The darkness of the 
woods was rent by streamers of 
ruler-straight light beams. They 
began to radiate like luminous 
wheel-spokes through the tangled 
leaves of the woods. 

“Men!” cried the alien mind. 
“Men are coming here. Men, our 
enemies!” 

Jerry, still in partial control of 
the invisible rat-body, fought the 
flight-impulse that began to stir 
beneath the unseen skin. 

“Run!” shrieked the alien mind. 
“You fool, can’t you see that we 



must flee this place? Quickly, or 
we are done for!” 

“Run — Flee — ” Jerry said 
dully, within the alien mind. ‘Yes. 
Run from men . the eternal 
enemy, men. Run, hide, -a dark 
corner, under a bush, behind a 
tree . .” 

He felt his own mind joining 
that of the alien in the prelimi- 
nary tension that comes before 
flight . Then the glaring beam 
of the arc-torch was full in his 
eyes, and the hypnotic illusion, at 
this, the trigger of his psyche, was 
shattered. And Jerry once again 
knew himself to be a man. 

A man in the body of a rat — 
the animal which Jerry Norcriss 
loathed most of all creatures! 

“Run!” screamed the alien. 
“Why don’t you — !” Its com- 
mands ceased as it realized the 
difference within the mind that 
had invaded its body. “You 
again!” it cried, trying wildly to 
reassume the placid plump image 
of that unseen baby once more. 

“You’re too late,” said Jerry, 
fighting its will with his own as 
the crewmen broke from the un- 
derbrush into the clearing, and 
the tech, pointing straight at him, 
yelled a caution to the man with 
the flame thrower. The man 
bringing, up the terrible gaping 
mouth of that weapon halted, 
waiting, as the tech stared at the 
stopwatch in his hand. 

“Five seconds!” cried the tech. 



120 



GALAXY 



“Four . three . two . one 
. Get it, quick!” 

Jerry, still within the mind and 
watching with the same horrified 
fascination as his host, saw the 
puff of flame within the flame- 
tube of the weapon, then saw the 
insane red flower blossoming with 
its smoking yellow tendrils toward 
his face — 

And the silent white lightning 
flared — 

And he sat up on the couch, 
back in the solarium. 

ANA hurried over to him. 

“Did it work? Did it work, 
sir?” she cried. “Is Bob — ” 

Jerry patted her hand. “Bob’s 
all right. He was on time. Just on 
time.” 

“i still don’t understand, sir,” 
said the nurse, sinking onto the 
couch beside him without waiting 
for an invitation. “I don’t under- 
stand any of this!” 

For an instant, Jerry resented 
this familiarity, then felt slightly 
overstuffed, and slipped an arm 
paternally across her slim shoul- 
ders. 

“I’ll explain,” he said. “It’ll pass 
the time till he gets back.” 

Jana nodded. 

“The alien,” Jerry said softly, 
“was a mimic. A perfect mimic. 
It was, while non-intelligent, of an 
abnormally well developed mind 
in one function: telepathy. That’s 
how it could carry on apparently 



intelligent mental conversation/ 
with me, during my first contact. 
It could sense my questions, then 
probe my mind for the answers I 
wanted most to hear — and play 
them back to me. For my forty 
minutes of contact, it told me only 
what I wanted to know, like a 
selective echo. It needed no un- 
derstanding of my questions, nor 
of the answers it plucked from my 
mind. It had one instinct: self- 
preservation. It could sense my 
question, select an uncontrover- 
sial answer from my mind and 
feed it back to me, without really 
understanding how it warded me 
off as a menace to it, any more 
than a dog understands why low- 
ering its ears and hanging its head 
as it whines can fend off the wrath 
of its master. It works; that’s all 
the creature cares about.” 

“But how did you know — ?” 
Jana asked. 

“I didn’t,” Jerry replied. “It 
fooled me completely. Until the 
Ensign — Bob told me that my 
full forty minutes in Contact had 
elapsed, despite my knowledge 
that the sun and clouds had re- 
mained motionless during my 
Contact. That threw me. I’ll ad- 
mit, for quite a while. It just 
didn’t make sense.” 

Jana’s eyes widened as she sud- 
denly understood. “And then you 
realized that you had seen the 
sun and clouds motionless be- 
cause that was what you expected 



BIG BABY 



121 



to experience when enhosted in a 
baby!” 

“That’s it,” Jerry nodded. “It 
made an error with the baby, 
though. It was able to duplicate 
it in almost every respect except 
two: Size and appearance.” 

“Why?” asked Jana. “And why 
appear as a baby at all?” 

iiT’M COMING to that,” said 
Jerry. “The size was off be- 
cause the first thing I saw when 
I blinked open my eyes was a 
distant copse of trees, which I 
took to be an upright pile of leafy 
twigs. Since my mind possessed 
information regarding the rela- 
tive size of babies and twigs, the 
alien immediately made sure my 
mind saw other things in the same 
perspective. By the time it real- 
ized it had made an error, it was 
too late to normalize the baby’s 
dimensions; that would have 
given its fakery away.” 

“But why did the thing choose 
a baby?” 

“Because that was the thing’s 
protection! It had a powerful hyp- 
notic power, one that worked on 
its victims minds directly through 
its telepathic interference with 
sensory perception. It always ap- 
peared as the thing the victim 
would be least likely to harm. In 
my case, a baby. But it made a 
slight error there, too. I’m a 
bachelor, Jana. There’s only one 
baby with whom I ever had any 



great amount of experience: my 
self.” 

“And the invisibility?” 

“I have no recollection, even 
now, of my body when I was a 
baby. I may have stared at my 
toes, played with my fingers, but 
they just never registered on my 
consciousness as being part of 
myself. So the thing was stuck 
when it came to reproducing me 
visually, since it depended upon 
my own memory for details. But 
it was able to supply the way I’d 
felt as a baby. Every baby has an 
acute awareness of its own skin; 
it will cry if any particle of its 
flesh is bothered in the slightest. 
So the alien fed the ‘feel’ of my 
baby-body back to me, if not the 
view. Which is why the electronic 
brain on the ship was able to 
duplicate the detail into an almost 
p>erfect replica of my babyhood 
likeness.” 

Jana nodded, as she finally un- 
derstood the meaning of that 
strange illusion. “And this time? 
That post-hypnotic suggestion 
you had the doctor give you, I 
mean: that you’d think you were 
a gray rat until such time as the 
light of the arc-torch caught you 
directly in the eyes . .” 

“Duplicity, Jana. It had to be 
that way. The alien was very sure 
of its powers. If I returned, and 
it were a baby again, I couldn’t 
attack it or thwart its ends. And 
such an attack was necessary. I 



122 



GALAXY 



had to be able to fight it, to hold 
it in place for that last moment 
before it was destroyed. Which is 
why I chose a gray rat, an animal 
I cannot bear the sight of. When 
the light struck my eyes and I 
became myself again, I caught 
the alien unawares. Then, before 
it could change to a baby, and 
start lulling me back into cama- 
raderie, it was too late. Bob had 
given the order to fire. And here 
I am.” 

¥ TURR YIN G footsteps sounded 
in the corridor. The door 
burst open and Bob rushed in, his 
face anxious and creased with 
worry until he saw Jerry sitting 
on the couch, alive and well. 

“Whoosh!” The tech expelled a 
mingled chuckle and sigh as he 
sank into a chair opposite the zo- 
ologist. “Well, sir, I can’t tell you 
how glad I am to see you. I 
couldn’t be sure you’d gotten out 
of that thing alive until I got back 
here. Glad you made it, sir. Damn 
glad!” 

“That ‘thing’ you mentioned,” 
said Jerry. “What did it actually 
look like?” 

Bob jerked his head toward the 
corridor. “The other guys are 
bringing it along. I kind of 
thought you’d want a peep at it.” 

As more footfalls were heard 
from the corridor. Bob bounced to 
his feet again, and stepped to the 
door. “Hold it a minute, guys,” he 



said, then turned back into the 
room. “Jana, I don’t think you’d 
better stick around for this. It’s 
not very pretty.” 

The girl hesitated, then flashed 
him a smile and shook her head. 
“I’ll stay. It can’t look as ugly as 
a bad case of peritonitis on the 
surgeon’s table. If I can take that 
without upchucking, I can take 
anything.” 

Bob shrugged. “Suit yourself, 
honey. Just remember you got 
fair warning.” He leaned back out 
the door. “Okay. Bring it in.” 

The crewmen, looking a little 
ill, came slowly into the room, 
bearing a bloated, scorched ob- 
ject on a stretcher thejr’d con- 
trived from two long poles and 
their jackets. They set it onto the 
tiled floor before the zoologist, 
then stepped away, all of them 
wiping their hands hard against 
their trousers in ludicrous unison, 
though their grip on the poles had 
not brought them into actual con- 
tact with the alien’s corpse. 

“There it is, sir,” said Ollie 
Gibbs. “And you are very wel- 
come to it.” 

Jana, to her credit, had not up- 
chucked, but she went a shade 
paler, and her mouth grew tight. 

Jerry studied the burnt husk, 
from its sharp-fanged mouth — 
easily eighteen inches from side 
to side — to its stubby centipedal 
cilia under the grossly swollen 
body. 



BIG BABY 



123 




“Damn thing’s all bloat, slime 
and mouth,” said the tech, sud- 
denly shuddering. “I wonder if its 
victims felt those jaws rending 
them open, or if it kept their 
minds fooled through to the end?” 
“I don’t think we’ll ever know 
that. Ensign,” said Jerry. “Unless 
you feel like going out there and 
playing victim to one of this 
thing’s confreres?” 

“No thanks, sir,” said Bob, so 
swiftly that Jana laughed. ‘Td 
rather fall out an airlock in hyper- 
space.” 

here’s what we do to 
” get rid of this thing, 
then,” said Jerry. “Since it as- 
sumes a form that’s the least 
likely to be harmed by whatever 
presence stimulates its mimetic 
senses, we’ll have to trick it. Be- 
fore this thing decomposes too far, 
rig it up with an electrical charge, 
and stimulate its nerve-centers 
artificially. That ought to give you 
an accurate microtape of its life- 
pulse. Then hook the tape to a 
scanner-beam, and send the life- 
pulse into the mine-area. When 
the fellows of this creature react 
to it, they’ll assume the safest pos- 
sible form: their own.” 

“I get you, sir!” said Bob. “Then 
all the miners have to do is see it 
for what it is, and shoot it.” 

Jerry nodded. “It’ll mean all 
miners will have to go armed for 
awhile. But that’s better than 



getting eaten alive by one of 
these.” 

“You sure their presence won’t 
trigger the thing’s mimetic pow- 
er?” asked Bob, uneasily. 

“Not if you give full power to 
the scanner-beam,” Jerry replied. 
“It’ll muffle their life-pulse radia- 
tions under the brunt of the arti- 
ficial one.” 

“Good enough, sir,” said Bob. 
“I’ll rig it right away.” 

Jerry shook his head. “No need. 
You could use some rest, I’m sure. 
The morning’ll be soon enough. 
Meantime, you can see this young 
lady home. The rest of you,” he 
said to the hovering crewmen, 
“are dismissed, too.” 

The men, eager to be away 
from the thing, saluted smartly 
and hurried out of the solarium, 
buzzing with wordy relief. 

Jana paused a moment, staring 
at the creature whose strange 
powers had destroyed her father. 
Then she turned to Bob. 

“I think I’ll go to Jim’s place,” 
she said. “I want him to know.” 
She moved her gaze to Jerry. “I 
owe you a lot,” she said. “We all 
owe you a lot” 

Embarrassed by the warmth of 
her praise, Jerry could only mum- 
ble something diffident and look 
the other way. He was taken quite 
by surprise by the pressure of cool 
moist lips against the side of his 
face. 

When he looked back at the 



BIG BABY 



125 




pair, Bob and Jana were on their 
way out the door. 

Only when he heard the eleva- 
tor doors at the end of the corri- 
dor close behind them did he 
move to the still-warm corpse of 
his onetime adversary, with a 
look of deepest compassion on 
his face. 

“Well,” he said gently, “you’ve 
lost. The planet goes back to the 
invaders. Once again. Earth has 
successfully obliterated the op- 
position.” 

He reached out a hand and 
touched the hulking thing on the 
floor. “Good-by,” he said. “And 
I’m sorry.” 

Jerry Norcriss wasn’t thinking 
about the deadliness of the thing, 
nor of the deaths of the hapless 
miners, nor of the billions of dol- 
lars he’d saved the investors hold- 
ing Praesodynimium stock. He 
was thinking of a voice that — 
even unintelligently, even in the 
course of deception — had said, 
‘Toor Jerry. Rest . Relax. 
You’re safe . Secure . .” 

“You really had me going for 
a while, baby,” he said, then 
blinked at the sudden sharp sting 
in his eyes, and hurried from the 
room. 

/^UTSIDE, the sun was glowing 
pink against the black eastern 
sky, and the air was cool and 
fresh in his nostrils. As he crossed 
the street from the hospital, head- 



ing toward the landing field and 
his shipboard bunk, a hurrying 
figure from the end of the block 
caught up with him and began to 
pace his stride, panting slightly. 

“Talk about happy,” said Bob, 
glumly. ‘When Jana told her boy 
friend the news, they went into 
such a clinch I didn’t even stick 
around to be introduced. Seemed 
a nice enough guy, I guess. Hope 
she’ll be happy with him.” 

Jerry recognized the gloomi- 
ness of the tech’s mood, and its 
cause, so didn’t say anything. 
After a moment. Bob seemed to 
recover himself a little. 

“Sir,” he said, “there’s one thing 
still bugs me about this alien.” 
“Oh?” said Jerry, halting. 
“What’s that. Ensign?” 

“How’d the initial roborocket 
miss the thing and its kind when 
it circled the planet before coloni- 
zation began?” 

“That’s a moot question,” said 
Jerry. “But my conjecture is that 
the scanner always caught it 
when it was assuming some other 
form. Since its victims were 
always indigenous to this planet, 
the things familiar to them were 
also of this planet, and the scan- 
ner-beam couldn’t detect any life- 
pulses which were dissimilar to 
already-known species.” 

“I’ll be damned,” said Bob. “It’s 
almost childishly simple when 
you explain it.” Then, as Jerry 
went to start off again. Bob 



126 



GALAXY 



stopped him with an exclamation. 

“What about that melting mine 
car I read about on the transla- 
tion sheets? Was that for real, or 
wasn’t it?” 

Jerry shook his head. “Part of 
the general mimetic illusion, like 
the motionless clouds and un- 
moving trees. It let me see what 
I expected to see. In reality, I was 
just in the woods near the mine 
area, where you came upon the 
creature to destroy it.” Jerry 
started slowly moving away once 
more. 

A few steps further, and Bob 
halted again. “One final point, 
sir. That life-pulsing reading of 
point-nine-nine-nine. If the thing’s 
pulsation was that powerful, I 
should think it would’ve been a 
lot harder to knock off than it 
was.” 

“You’re right,” said Jerry. “It 
would have been. But its life-pulse 
wasn’t nearly that high.” 

“But the scanner-beam — ” Bob 
protested. “When the colony sent 
up that roborocket, after those 
miners vanished, it reported an 
unknown life-pulse of point-nine- 
nine-nine. If that wasn’t the al- 
ien’s life-pulse, what the devil was 
it?” 

Jerry patted Bob on the shoul- 
der. “You’re forgetting the mimic- 
ry. The roborocket they sent up 
caught the alien off-guard, in its 
own shape, not imitating some 
other life-form’s pulsations. It de- 



tected the beam, since a scanner 
picks up mental pulses, and it in-

This was the endless problem of all spaceship cooks: He had 
to feed the men tomorrow on what they had eaten todayl 



By ALLEN KIM LANG 



U NABLE to get out to the 
ballgame and a long way 
off from the girls, men on 
ships think about, talk about, 
bitch about their food. It’s true 
that Woman remains a topic of 
thoughtful study, but discussion 
can never replace practice in an 
art Food, on the other hand, is 
a challenge shipmen face three 
times a day, so central to their 
thoughts that a history of sea- 



faring can be read from a com- 
missary list. 

In the days when salt-sea 
sailors were charting islands and 
spearing seals, for example, the 
fo’c’s’le hands called themselves 
Lobscousers, celebrating the 
liquid hash then prominent in 
the marine menu. The Limey 
sailor got the name of the anti- 
scorbutic citrus squeezed into his 
diet- a fruit known to us mariners 



of a more sophisticated age only

gin-and-tonic. And today

our 

And today we 
I are called Slimeheads, 

honoring in our title the Chlorella 
and Scenedesmus algae that, by 
filling up the spaces within, open 
the road to the larger Space with- 
out. 

Should any groimdsman dis- 
pute the importance of belly- 
furniture in history — whether 
it be exterminating whales, or 
introducing syphilis to the Fiji 
Islanders, or settling the Austra- 
lian littoral with cross-coves 
from Middlesex and Hampshire 
— he is referred to the hundred- 
and-first chapter of Moby Dick, 
a book spooled in the amusentent 
tanks of all but the smallest 
spacers. I trust, however, that no 
Marsman will undertake to re- 
view this inventory of refresh- 
ment more than a week from 
groundfall. A catalogue of sides 
of beef and heads of Leyden 
cheese and ankers of good 
Geneva would prove heavy read- 
ing for a man condemned to 
snack on the Chlorella-spawn of 
cis-Martian space. 

The Pequotfs crew ate wormy 
biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz’s 
men won their war on canned 
pork and beans. The Triton made 
her underwater periplus of Earth 
with a galley stocked with frozen 
pizza and concentrated apple- 
juice. But then, when sailors left 



GOURMET 



the seas for the skies, a decline 
set in. 

The first amenity of groundside 
existence to be abandoned was 
decent food. The earliest men 
into the vacuum swallowed pro- 
tein squeezings from aluminum 
tubes, and were glad enough to 
drop back to the groundsman’s 
diet of steak and fried potatoes. 

T ONG before I was a boy in 
^ Med School, itching to look 
at black sky through a view- 
port, galley science had fulfilled 
the disgusting exordium of 
Isaiah 36:12, to feed the Slime- 
heads for breakfast today what 
was day-before-yesterday’s table- 
scraps and jakes-water. 

The Ship’s Cook, the man who 
accomplishes the daily miracle of 
turning offal into eatables, is in 
many ways the most vital man 
aboard a spacer. He can make 
morale or foment a mutiny. His 
power is paramount. Slimeheads 
remember the H. M. S. Aiax^ 
fiasco, for example, in which a 
galleyman leveled his Chlorella 
tanks with heavy water from the 
ship’s shielding. Four officers and 
twenty-one Other Ranks were 
rescued from the Ajax in deep 
space, half dead from deuterium 
poisoning. We think of the Ben jo 
Maru incident, too, caused by a 
Ship’s Cook who allowed his 
algaeal staff-of-life to become 
contaminated with a fast-grow- 



128

ing Saccharomycodes yeast. The 
Japanese vessel staggered to her 
pad at Piano West after a twenty- 
week drunk: the alien yeast had 
got into the stomach of every 
man aboard, where it fermented 
each subsequent bite he ate to a 
superior grade of sake. And for a 
third footnote to the ancient ob- 
servation, “God sends food, and 
the Devil sends cooks,” Marsmen 
will recall what happened aboard 
my ship the Charles Partlow 
Sale. 

The Sale blasted off from 
Brady Station in the middle of 
August, due in at Piano West 
in early May. In no special hurry, 
we were taking the low-energy 
route to Mars, a pathway about 
as long in time as the human 
period of gestation. Our cargo 
consisted mostly of Tien-Shen 
fir seedlings and some tons of an 
arctic grass-seed — these to be 
planted in the maria to squeeze 
out the native blue bugberry 
vines. We had aboard the Reg- 
istry minimum of six men and 
three officers. Ship’s Surgeon was 
myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Cap- 
tain was Willy Winkelmann, the 
hardest man in space and very 
likely the fattest. Ship’s Cook 
was Robert Bailey. 

Cooking aboard a spacer is a 
job combining the more frustrat- 
ing tensions of biochemistry, 
applied mycology, high-speed 
farming, dietetics and sewage 



engineering. It’s the Cook’s re- 
sponsibility to see that each man 
aboard gets each day no less than 
five pounds of water, two pounds 
of oxygen, and one-and-a-half 



T 



pounds of dry food. This isn’t 
just a paragraph from the Spacer 
Union Contract. It’s a statement 
of the least fuel a man can run 
on. 

Twelve tons of water, oxygen, 
and food would hav£ filled the 
cargo compartments to bursting, 
and left a small ship like the 
C. P. Sale no reason to reach 
for Mars. By allowing a colony 
of Chlorella algae to work over 
our used air, water and other 
effluvia, though, three tons of 
metabolites would see us through 
from Brady Station to Piano West 
and back. Recycling was the 
answer. The molecule of car- 
bohydrate, fat, protein or mineral 
that didn’t feed the crew fed 
the algae. And the algae fed us. 

All waste was used to fertilize 
our liquid fields. Even the stubble 
from our 2,680 shaves and the 
clippings from our 666 haircuts 
en route and back would be fed 
into the Chlorella tanks. Human 
hair is rich in essential amino 
acids. 

The algae — dried by the 
Cook, bleached with methyl 
alcohol to kill the smell and 
make the residue more digestible, 
disguised and seasoned in a hun- 
dred ways — served hs a sort 

GALAXY 



of meat-and-p>otatoes that never 
quite wore out. Our air and water 
were equally immortal. Each 
molecule of oxygen would be con- 
versant with the alveoli of every 
man aboard by the end of our 
trip. Every drop of water would 
have been intimate with the 
glomeruli of each kidney on the 
ship before we grounded in. 
Groundling politicians are right 
enough when they say that we 
spacers are a breed apart. We’re 
the one race of men who can’t 
afford the luxury of squeamish- 
ness. 

^ I ‘'HOUGH I’m signed aboard as 
Ship’s Surgeon, I seldom lift 
a knife in space. My employment 
is more in the nature of TS-card- 
puncher extraordinary. My duties 
are to serve as wailing-wall, 
morale officer, guardian of the 
medicinal whiskey and frustrator 
of mutual murder. Generally the 
man aboard who’d serve as the 
most popular murder-victim is 
the Cook. This trip, the-man-you- 
love-to-hate was our Captain. 

If the Cook hadn’t problems 
enough with the chemical and 
psychic duties of his office, 
Winkelmarm supplied the want. 
Captain Willy Winkelmann was 
the sort of man who, if he had to 
go into space at all, had best do 
so alone. If the Prussians had a 
Marine Corps, Winkelmann 
would have done splendidly as 

GOURMET 



Drill Instructor for their boot 
camp. His heart was a chip of 
helium ice, his voice dripped 
sarcastic acid. The planet Earth 
was hardly large enough to ac- 
commodate a wart as annoying as 
Willy Winkelmann. Cheek-by- 
jowl every day in a nacelle the 
size of a Pullman car, our Cap- 
tain quickly established himself 
as a major social hemorrhoid. 

The Captain’s particular patsy 
was, of course, young Bailey the 
Cook. It was Winkelmann who 
saw humerous possibilities in the 
entry, “Bailey, Robert,” on Ship’s 
Articles. He at once renamed our 
imfortunate shipmate “Belly- 
Robber.” It was Winkelmann 
who discussed haut cuisine and 
the properties of the nobler 
wines while we munched our 
algaeburgers and sipped coffee 
that tasted of utility water. And 
it was Captain Willy Winkel- 
mann who never referred to the 
ship’s head by any other name 
than The Kitchen Cabinet. 

Bailey tried to feed us by 
groundside standards. He hid the 
taste of synthetic methionine — 
an essential amino acid not 
synthesized by Chlorella — by 
seasoning our algaeal repasts 
with pinches of oregano and 
thyme. He tinted the pale-green 
dollops of pressed Chlorella pink, 
textured the mass to the con- 
sistency of hamburger and toasted 
the slabs to a delicate brown in 



130 



131 



a forlorn attempt to make mock- 
meat. For dessert, he served a 
fudge compounded from the dex- 
trose-paste of the carbohydrate 
recycler. The crew thanked him. 
The Captain did not. “Belly- 
Robber,” he said, his tone icy as 
winter wind off the North Sea, 
“you had best cycle this mess 
through the tanks again. There 
is a pun in my home country: 
Mensch ist was er isst. It means, 
you are what you eat. I think 
you are impertinent to suggest I 
should become this Schweinerei 
you are feeding me.” Captain 
Winkelmann blotted his chin 
with his napkin, heaved his bulk 



you set a table second to none.” 

Bailey took a handful of 
dried Chlorella from a bin and 
fingered it. It was green, smelled 
of swamp, and looked appetizing 
as a bedsore. “This is what I have 
to work with,” he said. He tossed 
the stuff back into its bin. “In 
Ohio, which is my home country, 
in the presence of ladies, we’d 
call such garbage Horse-Leav- 
ings.” 

“You’ll never make Winkel- 
mann happy,” I said. “Even the 
simultaneous death of all other 
human beings could hardly make 
him smile. Keep up the good 
work, though, and you’ll keep our 



nine heads like crisp, three-di- 
mensional jigsaw puzzles. The 
piece de resistance was again a 
“hamburger steak;” but this time 
the algaeal mass that made it up 
was buried in a rich, meaty gravy 
that was only faintly green. The 
essence-of-steak used in these 
Chlorella cutlets had been 
sprinkled with a lavish hand. 
Garlic was richly in evidence. 
“It’s so tender,” the radioman 
joked, “that I can hardly be- 
lieve it’s really steak.” 

Bailey stared across the dining- 
cubby toward Winkelmann, si- 
lently imploring the Captain’s 
ratification of his masterpiece. 
The big man’s pink cheeks bulged 
and jumped with his chewing. He 
swallowed. “Belly-Robber,” Win- 
kelmann said, “I had almost 
rather you served me this pond- 
scum raw than have it all 
mucked-up with synthetic onions 
and cycler-salt.” 

seem able enough to 
choke down Bailey’s chow. 
Captain,” I said. I gazed at Win- 
kelmann’s form, bulbous from a 
lifetime of surfeit feeding. 

“Yes, I eat it,” the Captain 
said, taking and talking through 
another bite. “But I eat only as a 
man in the desert will eat worms 
and grasshoppers, to stay alive.” 
“Sir, what in heaven’s name 
do you expect from me?” Bailey 
pleaded. 

GOURMET 



“Only good food,’* Winkel- 
mann mumbled through his 
mouthful of disguised algae. He 
tapped his head with a finger. 
“This — the brain that guides 
the ship — carmot be coaxed to 
work on hog-slop. You under- 
stand me, Belly-Robber?” 

Bailey, his hands fisted at his 
sides, nodded. “Yes, sir. But I 
really don’t know what I can do 
to please you.” 

“You are a spacer and a Ship’s 
Cook, not a suburban Hausfrau 
with the vapors,” Winkelmann 
said. “I do not expect from you 
hysterics, tantrums or weeping. 
Only — can you understand this, 
so simple? — food that will keep 
my belly content and my brain 
alive.” 

“Yes, sir,” Bailey said, his face 
a picture of that offense the 
British term Dumb Insolence. 

Winkelmann got up and 
climbed the ladder to the pilot- 
cubicle. I followed him. “Cap- 
tain,” I said, “you’re driving 
Bailey too hard. You’re asking 
him to make bricks without 
straw.” 

Winkelmann regarded me with 
his pale-blue stare. “You think. 
Doctor, that my cruelty to the 
Belly-Robber is the biliousness 
of a middle-aged man?” 

“Frankly, I can’t understand 
your attitude at all,” I said. 

“You accuse me of driving a 
man to make bricks without 




up from the table, and climbed 
up the ladder from the dining- 
cubby. 

441^0C, do you like Winkel- 

■®-'mann?” the Cook asked 
me. 

“Not much,” I said. “I suspect 
that the finest gift our Captain 
can give his mother is to be 
absent from her on Mother’s 
Day. But we’ve got to live with 
him. He’s a good man at driving 
a ship.” 

“I wish he’d leave off driving 
this Cook,” Bailey said. “The fat 
swine!” 

“His plumpness is an unwitting 
tribute to your cooking, Bailey,” 
I said. “He eats well. We all do. 
I’ve dined aboard a lot of spacers 
in my time, and I’ll testify that 












Captain fat.” 

Bailey nodded from his one- 
man cloud of gloom. I got a 
bottle of rye from Medical Stores 
and offered him a therapeutic 
draught. The Cook waved my 
gift aside. “Not now. Doc,” he 
said. “I’m thinking about to- 
morrow’s menu.” 

The product of Bailey’s cere- 
brations was on the mess table at 
noon the next day. We were each 
served an individual head of 
lettuce, dressed with something 
very like vinegar and oil, spiced 
with tiny leaves of burnet. How 
Bailey had constructed those 
synthetic lettuces I can only 
guess: the hours spent preparing 
a green Chlorella paste, rolling 
and drying and shaping each arti- 
ficial leaf, the fitting together of

straw,” Winkelmann said. “Very 
well, Doctor. It is my belief that 
if the Pharaoh’s taskmaster had 
had my firmness of purpose, the 
Children of Israel would have 
made bricks with stubble. Neces- 
sity, Doctor, is the mother of 
invention. I am Bailey’s neces- 
sity. My unkindnesses make him 
uncomfortable, I doubt that not. 
But I am forcing him to ex- 
periment, to improvise, to widen 
the horizons of his ingenuity. He 
will learn somehow to bring good 
food from Chlorella tanks.” 

“You’re driving him too hard. 
Sir,” I said. “He’ll crack.” 

“Bailey will have some fifty 
thousand dollars’ salary waiting 
when we ground at Brady Sta- 
tion,” Captain Winkelmann said. 
“So much money buys many dis- 
comforts. That will be all. Doc- 
tor Vilanova.” 

“Crew morale on the ship . .” 
I began. 

“That will be all. Doctor Vila- 
nova,” Captain Winkelmann re- 
peated. 

T>AILEY grew more silent as 
^we threaded our way along 
the elliptical path to Mars. Each 
meal he prepared was a fresh 
attempt to propitiate the appetite 
of our splenetic Captain. Each 
such offering was condemned by 
that heartless man. Bailey began 
to try avoiding the Captain at 
mealtimes, but was frustrated 



by Winkelmann’s orders. “Con- 
vey my compliments to the Chef, 
please,” the Captain would 
instruct one of the crew, “and 
ask him to step down here a 
moment.” And the Cook would 
cheerlessly appear in the dining- 
cubby, to have his culinary genius 
acidly called in question again. 

I myself do not doubt that 
Bailey was the finest Cook ever 
to go into Hohmann orbit. His 
every meal established a higher 
benchmark in brilliant galley- 
manship. We were served, for 
instance, an ersatz hot turkey 
supreme. The cheese-sauce was 
almost believable, the Chlorella 
turkey-flesh was white and 
tender. Bailey served with this 
delicacy a grainy and delicious 
“cornbread,” and had extracted 
from his algae a lipid butter- 
substitute that soaked into the 
hot “bread” with a genuinely 
dairy smell. “Splendid, Bailey,” 
I said. 

“We are not amused,” said 
Captain Winkelmann, accepting 
a second helping of the pseudo- 
turkey. “You are improving, 
Belly-Robber, but only arithme- 
tically. Your first efforts were so 
hideous as to require a geometric 
progression of improving excel- 
lence to raise them to mere 
edibility. By the time we are half- 
way ’round the Sun, I trust you 
will have learned to cook with 
the competence of a freshman 



Home Economics student. That 
will be all, Bailey.” 

The crew and my fellow-of- 
ficers were amused by Winkel- 
mann’s riding of Bailey; they 
were in addition gratified that 
the battle between their Cap- 
tain and their Cook served to 
feed them so well. Most spacers 
embark on an outward voyage 
somewhat plump, having .eaten 
enough on their last few days 
aground to smuggle several hun- 
dred calories of fat and many 
memories of good food aboard 
with them. This trip, none of 
the men had lost weight during 
the first four months in space. 
Winkelmann, indeed, seemed to 
have gained. His uniform was 
taut over his plump backside, and 
he puffed a bit up the ladders. I 
was considering suggesting to our 
Captain that he curtail his diet 
for reasons of health, a bit of 
advice that would have stood 
unique in the annals of space 
medicine, when Winkelmann 
produced his supreme insult to 
our Cook.

rACH man aboard a spacer is 
allowed ten kilograms of per-

playing-cards, knitting-wool, whis- 
key or what have you to help 
him while away the hours be- 
tween the planets. Bailey, I knew 
for a fact, had used up his weight- 
allowance in bringing aboard a 
case ^of spices: marjoram and 
mint, costmary, file powder, basil 
and allspice, and a dozen others. 

Captain Winkelmann was not 
a reader, and had brought no 
books. Cards interested him not 
at all, as card-playing implies a 
sociability alien to his nature. He 
never drank aboard ship. I had 
supposed that he’d exercised his 
option of returning his personal- 
effects weight allowance to the 
owners for the consideration of 
one hundred dollars a kilogram. 
To collect the maximum allow- 
ance, spacers have been known 
to come aboard their ship mother- 
naked. 

But this was not the case with 
WinkelmannT His personal-effects 
baggage, an unlabeled cardboard 
box, appeared under the table at 
noon mess some hundred days 
out from Piano West. Winkel- 
mann rested his feet on the mys- 
terious box as he sat to eat. 

“What disgusting form does 
the ship’s garbage appear in to- 
day, Belly-Robber?” he asked 
the Cook. 

Bailey frowned, but kept his 
temper, an asceticism in which by 
now he’d had much practice. 
“I’ve been working on the. pro-

blem of steak, Sir,” he said. “I 
think I’ve whipped the taste; 
what was left was to get the tex- 
ture steak-like. Do you under- 
stand, Sir?” 

“I understand,” Winkelmann 
growled. “You intend that your 
latest niess should feel like steak 
to the mouth, and not like baby- 
food. Right?” 

“Yes, Sir,” Bailey said. “Well, 
I squeezed the steak-substrate — 
Chlorella, of course, with all sorts 
of special seasonings — through 
a sieve, and blanched the strands 
in hot algaeal oil. Then I chopped 
those strands to bits and rolled 
them out. Voila! I had something 
very close in texture to the 
muscle-fibers of genuine meat.” 

“Remarkable, Bailey,” I said. 

“It rather throws me off my 
appetite to hear how you muddle 
about with our food,” the Cap- 
tain said, his jowls settling into 
an expression of distaste. “It’s 
quite all right to eat lobster, for 
example, but I never cared to see 
the ugly , beast boiled before my 
eyes. Detail spoils the meal.” 

Bailey lifted the cover off the 
electric warming-pan at the cen- 
ter of the table and tenderly 
lifted a small “steak” onto each 
of our plates. “Try it,” he urged 
the Captain. 

^APTAIN Winkelmann sliced 
^ off a corner of his algaeal 
steak. The color was an excel- 



lent medium-rare, the odor was 
the rich smell of fresh-broiled 
beef. Winkelmann bit down, 
chewed, swallowed. “No too bad, 
Belly-Robber,” he said, nodding. 
Bailey grinned and bobbed his 
head, his hands folded before him 
in an ecstasy of pleasure. A kind 
word from the Captain bettered 
the ruffles-and-flourishes of a 
more reasonable man. “But it 
still needs something . some- 
thing,” Winkelmann went on, 
slicing off another portion of the 
tasty Chlorella. “Aha! I have it!” 

“Yes, Sir?” Bailey asked. 

“This, Belly-Robber!” Winkel- 
mann reached beneath the mess- 
table and ripped open his card- 
board carton. He brought out a 
bottle and unscrewed the cap. 
“Ketchup,” he said, splattering 
the red juice over Bailey’s mas- 
terpiece. “The scarlet burial- 
shroud for the failures of Cooks.” 
Lifting a hunk of the “steak,” 
streaming ketchup, to his mouth, 
Winkelmann chewed. “Just the 
thing,” he smiled. 

“Damn you!” Bailey shouted. 

Winkelmann’s smile flicked off, 
and his blue eyes pierced the 
Cook. 

“. Sir,” Bailed added. 

“That’s better,” Winkelmann 
said, and took another bite. He 
said meditatively, “Used with 
caution, and only by myself, I 
believe I have sufficient ketchup 
here to see me through to Mars.

Please keep a bottle on the ''table 
for all my future meals, Belly- 
Robber.” 

“But, Sir . .” Bailey began. 

“You must realize, Belly-Rob- 
ber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a 
threat to the welfare of his ship. 
Were I to continue eating your 
surrealistic slops for another hun- 
dred days, without the small 
consolation of this sauce I had 
the foresight to bring with me, 
I’d likely be in no condition to 
jet us safely down to the Piano 
West pad. Do you understand, 
Belly-Robber?” he demanded. 

“I understand that you’re an 
ungrateful, impossible, square- 
headed, slave-driving . .” 

“Watch your noun,” Winkel- 
mann cautioned the Cook. “Your 
adjectives are insubordinate; your 
noun might prove mutinous.” 

“Captain, you’ve gone too far,” 
I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, 
was scarlet, his chest heaving with 
emotion. 

“Doctor, I must point out to 
you that it ill behooves the Ship’s 
Surgeon to side with the Cook 
against the Captain,” Winkel- 
mann said. 

“Sir, Bailey has tried hard to 
please you,” I said. “The other 
officers and the men have been 
more than satisfied with his 
work.” 

“That only suggests atrophy of 
their tastebuds,” Winkelmann 
said. “Doctor, you are excused. 



As are you, Belly-Robber,” he 
added. 

"DAILEY and I climbed from 
the mess compartment to- 
gether. I steered him to my 
quarters, where the medical sup- 
plies were stored. He sat on my 
bunk and exploded into weep-

metal bulkhead. “You’ll have 
that drink now,” I said. 

“No, dammit!” he shouted. 

“Orders,” I said. I poured us 
each some fifty cc’s of rye. “This 
is therapy, Bailey,” I told him. 
He poured the fiery stuff down 
his throat like water and silently 
held out his glass for a second. 
I provided it. 

After a few minutes Bailey’s 
sobbing ceased. “Sorry, Doc,” he 
said. 

“You’ve taken more pressure

“Nothing to be ashamed of.” 

“He’s crazy. What sane man

man.” 

“I hate him,” Bailey said with 
the simplicity of true emotion. 
He reached for the bottle. I let 
him have it. Sometimes alcohol 
can be an apt confederate of vis 
medicatrix naturae, the healing 
power of nature. Half an hour 
later I strapped Bailey into his 
bunk to sleep it off. That 
therapeutic drunk seemed to be 
just what he’d needed. 

For morning mess the next day 
we had a broth remarkable in 
horribleness, a pottage or boiled 
Chlorella vulgaris that looked 
and tasted like the vomit of some 
bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey, 
red-eyed and a-tremble, made no 
apology, and stared at Winkel- 
mann as though daring him to 
comment. The Captain lifted a 
spoonful of the disgusting stuff to 
his lips, smacked and said, “Belly- 
Robber, you’re improving a little 
at last.” 

Bailey nodded and smiled. 
“Thank you. Sir,” he said. 

I smiled, too. Bailey had con- 
quered himself. His psychic 
defenses were now strong enough 

138 



to withstand the Captain’s 
fiercest assaults of irony. Our food 
would likely be bad the rest of 
this trip, but that was a price 
I was willing to pay for seeing 
destroyed the Willy Winkelmann 
theory of forcing a Cook to make 
bricks without straw. The Cap- 
tain had pushed too hard. He’d 
need that ketchup for the meals 
to come, I thought. 

Noon mess was nearly as awful 
as breakfast had been. The coffee 
tasted of salt, and went largely 
undrunk. The men in the mess 
compartment were vehement in 
their protests, blaming the Caj>- 
tain, in his absence, for the de- 
cline in culinary standards. Bailey 
seemed not to care. He served 
the algaeburgers with half a mind, 
and hurried back into his galley 
oblivious of the taunts of his 
crewmates. 

^ I ■'HERE being only three seats 
in the Safe’s mess compart- 
ment, we ate our meals in three 
shifts. That evening, going down 
the ladder to supper, my nose 
was met with a spine-tingling bar- 
becue tang, a smell to make a 
man think of gray charcoal glow- 
ing in a picnic brazier, of cicadas 
chirping and green grass under- 
foot, of the pop and hiss of canned 
beer being church-keyed. “He’s 
done it. Doc!” one of the first- 
shift diners said. “It actually 
tastes of food!”

■ “Then he’s beat, the Captain 

■ at his game,” I said. 

f “The Dutchman won’t want to 
I mess ketchup on these steaks,” 
I the crewman said. 

I sat, imfolded my napkin, and 
looked with hope to the electric 
warming-pan at the center of the 
table. Bailey served the three of 
' us with the small “steaks.” Each 
contained about a pound of dried 
Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine 
I with my fork. But they were 
' drenched in a gravy rich as the 
stuff grandma used to make in 
her black iron skillet, peppery 
and seasoned with courageous 
bits of garlic. I cut a bit from my 
steak and chewed it. Too tender, 
of course; there are limits to art. 
But the pond-scum taste was 
j gone. Bailey appeared in the 
galley door. I gestured for him to 
join me. “You’ve done it, Bailey,” 
I said. “Every Slimehead in orbit 
will thank you for this. This is 
actually good." 

“Thanks, Doc,” Bailey said. 

I smiled and took another bite. 
“You may not realize it, Bailey; 
but this is a victory for the Cap- 
tain, too. He drove you to this 
triumph; you couldn’t have done 
it without him.” 

“You mean he was just whip- 
ping me on, trying to make me do 
better?” Bailey asked. 

“He was driving you to do the 
impossible,” I said; “and you did 
it. Our Captain may be a hard

man, Bailey; but he did know 
how to coax maximum perform- 
ance out of his Ship’s Cook.” 

Bailey stood up. “Do you like 
Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?” 
he asked. 

I thought about his question a 
moment. Winkelmann was good 
at his job. He persuaded his men 
by foul means, true; but it was all 
for the good of the ship and his 
crew. “Do I like Captain Winkel- 
mann?” I asked, spearing another 
piece of my artificial steak. “Bai- 
ley, I’m afraid I’ll have to admit 
that I do.” 

Bailey smiled and lifted a 
second steak from the warming- 
pan onto my plate. “Then have 
another piece,” he said.

“W 



"E need data,” I said 
as I manipulated 
the scanner and 
surveyed our little domain of 
rocks and vegetation. “The ani-

is of a low order.” 

“There is nothing here with 
intelligence,” Ven agreed, gestur- 
ing at the specimens in front of 
us. “Although they’re obviously 
related to our race, they’re quite 



incapable of constructing those 
artifacts we saw on our way 
down.” 

“Or of building electone com- 
munications or even airboats,” I 
added. 

“I expect that there is only one 
way to get what we want — and 
that’s to go looking for it,” Ven 
said as she smoothed her antennae 
with a primary digit. “I also ex- 
pect,” she added acidly, “that

so hard to start looking. Or did 
you have to set us down in this 
isolated spot?” 

I glared at her and she flushed 
a delicate lavender. “Do you 
think I landed here because I 
wanted to?” I asked with some 
bitterness, inflating my cheek 
pouches to better express my 
disgust. “There were less than 
two vards of useful fuel left on 
the reels when I cut the drives. 
There isn’t enough to take us 
across this valley. We came close 



to not making planetfall here at 
all.” 

“Oh,” Ven said in a small 
voice, vocalizing as she always 
does when she is embarrassed. 
Like most females, she finds it 
difficult to project normally when 
she is under emotional stress. 
Afraid or angry she can blow a 
hole in subspace; but embar- 
rassed, her projections are so faint 
that I have to strain my antennae 
to receive them. 

Her aura turned a shamefaced

nacreous lavender. I couldn t stay 
angry with her. She was lovely, 
and I was proud to be her mate. 
The Eugenics Council had made 
an unusually good match when 
they brought us together. The 
months we had spent aboard ship 
on our sabbatical had produced 
no serious p>ersonality conflicts. 
We fitted well, and I was more 
happy than any Thalassan had a 
right to be. 

“We shall have to try other 
measures,” I said. “Although 
there aren’t very many natives 
hereabouts, we had better start 
looking for them rather than wait 
for them to look for us.” I felt 
disappointed. I was certain that 
we made enough disturbance 
coming down for them to be here 
in droves, which was why I had 
the robots camouflage the ship to 
look like the surrounding rocks. 
There could be such a thing as 
too much attention. 

“They could have mistaken us 
for a meteor,” Ven said. 

“Probably,” I agreed. “But it 
would have saved a great deal 
of trouble if one of them had 
come to us.” I sighed. “Oh well,” 

I added, “it was only a hope, at 
best.” 

“I could explore,” Ven offered. 

“I was about to suggest that,” 
I said. “After all, the atmosphere 
is breathable although somewhat 
rich in oxygen, and the gravity 
is not too severe. It would be best 



to wait until dark before start- 
ing out. There may be danger. 
After all, this is an alien world, 
and Authority knows what’s out 
there.” 

Her antennae dropped, her 
aura dimmed to gray and her 
integument turned a greenish 
black. “It doesn’t sound pleas- 
ant,” she said. 

npHE sun dipped below the hori- 
-*• zon with an indecently gaudy 
display of color. After the last 
shades of violet had faded, I 
opened the airlock and watched 
Ven, a darker blot in the dark- 
ness of the night, slip away into 
the shadows. 

She went unarmed. I wanted 
her to take a blaster, but she 
refused, saying that she had never 
fired one, wouldn’t know what to 
do with one — and that its 
weight would hold her back. I 
didn’t like it. But I was unable 
to go with her, and it was better 
that she did as she wished at this 
time. 

I sat for a while in the entrance 
port watching the slow wheel of 
the stars across the heavens, and 
for a moment I wished that I were 
a female with the rugged phy- 
sique to withstand this gravity. 
As it was, the beauty of the night 
was lost on me. I breathed un- 
comfortably as the pressure 
crushed my body and made 
every joint and muscle ache. 



142 



GALAXY 



Males, I reflected gloomily, 
‘ weren’t what they were in the 
old days. Too much emphasis on 
mind, and not enough on body, 
had made us a sex of physical 
weaklings. 

I wondered bitterly if a brain 
was as worthwhile as the Council 
insisted. 

The next few hours were 
miserable. I worried about Ven, 
imagining a number of unpleas- 
ant things which might have hap- 
pened to her. I dragged myself 
into the control room and fiddled 
with the scanners, trying the infra 
and ultra bands as well as the 
normal visible spectrum in the 
hopes of seeing something. And 
just as I was beginning to feel 
the twinges of genuine fear, I 
heard Ven. 

Her projection was faint. “Help 
me, Eu! Help me!” 

I stumbled to the entrance port, 
dragging a blaster with me. 
“Where are you?” I projected. I 
couldn’t see her, but I could 
sense her presence. 

“Here, Eu. Just below you. 
Help me. I can’t make it any 
farther!” 

Somehow I managed it. I don’t 
know from where the strength 
came, but I was on the ground 
lifting her, pushing her onto the 
flat surface of the airlock — 
clambering up — dragging her 
in and closing the lock behind 
us. I looked down at her with 



pride. Who would have thought 
that I, a male, could lift a mature 
female into a ship’s airlock 
even against normal gravity? I 
chuckled shakily. Strange things 
happen to a body when its owner 
is stressed and its suprarenals are 
stimulated. 

She looked up at me. “Thank 
you,” she said simply. But there 
was more behind the words than 
the bare bones of customary grat- 
itude. 

T helped her into the refresher 
and as she restored her tired 
body I pelted her with numerous 
questions. 

“Did you succeed?” I asked. 
“Better than I expected.” 

“Did you find a native?” 

“Two of them.” The cubicle 
glowed a pale green as her 
strength came back. 

“Where?” 

“Two vursts from here — down 
the hill. They’re camped near a 
road. They have a big ground 
car with them.” 

“Did you see them?” 

“Yes.” 

“What did they look like.” 
The radiance in the cubicle 
flicked out. “They’re horrible!” 
Ven said. “Monstrous! Four or 
five times our size! I never saw 
anything so hideous!” 

“Did they see you?” 

“No, I don’t think so. They 
weren’t looking in my direction 



FOUNDING FATHER 



143 



at first. And I don’t think they 
can sense, because I was fright- 
ened and they didn’t respond to 
my projection.” She was begin- 
ning to recover. 

“You couldn’t have been too 
frightened,” I said. “I didn’t hear 
you — and you can reach farther 
than two vursts.” 

“Mostly I was repelled,” Ven 
admitted. 

“Why?” 

“I don’t know. They smelled 
bad, but it was more than that. 
There was something about them 
that made my antennae lie flat 
against my ears. Anyway — I 
did a foolish thing.” The cubicle 
turned a pale embarrassed lav- 
ender. 

“What did you do?” I de- 
manded. 

“I ran away,” Ven said. “And 
I made a lot of noise.” 

“All right — all right,” I said 
impatiently. “Go ahead and tell 
the rest of it.” 

“By the time I stopped run- 
ning I was down at the bottom of 
the hill,” Ven said. “I was dead 
tired — and with all that rock 
to climb to get back to the ship. 
I didn’t really think I’d make it.” 

“But you did,” I said proudly. 
“You’re a real Thalassan — pure 
green.” 

The cubicle slowly brightened 
again. 

“Can you find them again?” I 
asked. 



“Of course. I wasn’t lost at 
any time. If I hadn’t panicked. 
I’d have been back a whole lot 
sooner.” 

“Can you go now?” 

S HE shivered with distaste. “I 
can,” she said, “but I don’t 
want to.” 

“That’s nonsense. We can’t let 
a little physical revulsion stop us. 
After all, there are some pretty 
grim things to be seen in this 
universe.” 

“But nothing like this! I tell 
you, Eu, they’re horrible! That’s 
the only word that can describe 
them.” 

“Take a stat projector — ” I 
began. 

“Aren’t you coming?” she 
asked. 

“Two vursts on this planet? 
What do you think I am?” 

Her face hardened. “I don’t 
know,” she said coldly, “but I do 
know this — if you don’t come, 
I won’t go.” 

I groaned. From her aura I 
could tell she meant every word. 
It angered me, too, because 
Thalassan females usually don’t 
defy a male. “Remember,” I said 
icily, “that you’re not the only 
female on Thalassa.” 

“We’re not on Thalassa,” she 
said. Her aura was a curious 
leaden color, shot through with 
sullen red flares and blotches. 
“I have no right to force you,” 



144 



GALAXY 



she went on stubbornly, “but I 
can’t handle them alone. You 
simply have to come.” 

“But Ven — I’m a physical 
cipher. This gravity flattens me. 
I won’t make it.” 

“You will,” she said. “I’ll help 
you. But this job needs a male 
mind.” 

It was deliberate flattery, I 
suppose. But there was an ele- 
ment of truth in it. Ven obviously 
couldn’t do it, and obviously she 
thought I could. I couldn’t help 
feeling pride in her need for me. 
I liked the feeling. For, after all, 
we hadn’t been mated so long 
that there was too great an 
amount of familiarity in our rela- 
tionship. The Eugenics Council 
had taken care of that very effec-. 
tively when we announced our 
plans for our sabbatical. 

“All right — I’ll go,” I re- 
peated. 

With a quick light movement 
she touched my antennae with 
her primary digits. The shock ran 
through me clear to my pads. 
“You’re good,” she said — and 
the way she said it was an acco- 
lade. 

II 

t^fT^HIS way,” Ven said, emit- 
ting a faint yellow aura 
that lighted the area around her. 
“Follow me.” She staggered a 
little under the weight of the 



equipment she was carrying. I 
wished that we had enough power 
to energize an air sled — but we 
had none to spare. The robots 
had used up most of our scanty 
power metal reserves in camou- 
flaging the ship and the adaptor 
had taken the rest. This was going 
to be a miserable trip. It was 
going to be painful, uncomfort- 
able and perhaps even dangerous. 

It was. 

We went across rocks, through 
sharp-twigged brush — across the 
saw-edged grass of the meadow 
below us, over more rocks, and 
down-hill along a faint double 
trail that never seemed to end. 
I was nearly dead with weariness 
when Ven’s aura flicked off and 
the dark closed in. My proprio- 
ceptors were screaming as I sank 
to the ground and panted the 
rich air of this world in and out 
of my aching chest. 

“They’re just ahead,” Ven 
whispered. “Around that next 
group of rocks. Be careful.” 

We moved forward cautiously. 
“There was a fire,” Ven whis- 
pered. 

“There isn’t now,” I said. “I 
can’t sense any heat.” The night 
air blew a rank odor to my 
nostrils. My spines stiffened! I 
knew what Ven meant when she 
said that these natives repelled 
her. I had smelled that scent 
before — the scent of our an- 
cestral enemies! So these were 



FOUNDING FATHER 



145 



the natives, the dominant life on 
this planet! I gagged, my tongue 
thick in my throat. 

“You see?” Ven asked. 

I nodded. “It’s pretty bad,” I 
said. 

“It reminds me of a zoo,” Ven 
answered softly. 

I nodded. It did and it was 
thoroughly unpleasant. 

I strained my perception to its 
limits, pushing it through the 
gelid darkness, searching until I 
found the natives. “They’re 
asleep,” I said. 

“What’s that?” 

“Suspension of consciousness. 
Something like estivation.” 

“Oh. Then we can approach 
safely?” 

“If we are quiet,” I replied. 
“Sleep is broken easily and 
consciousness returns quickly.” 

The trail deepened beyond 
the rocks — two rutted tracks 
about three vards apart. We 
moved forward cautiously, our 
senses keyed to their highest 
pitch. The night was oppressively 
still and every movement rasped 
loudly. My breath came fast and 
shallow. My heart pounded and 
my musk glands were actively 
secreting as I parted the opening 
to their cloth shelter, and sensed 
the dim forms within. 

“Stat,” I projected and Ven 
handed me the weapon. It was 
almost more than I could manage 
in my weakened condition, but 



I aimed it and fired a full in- 
tensity blast at the nearest lumpy 
figure. It jerked and flopped in- 
side its coverings, and the second 
form sat up with horrid speed! 

A roar of soimd came from it 
as the air was filled with its 
fetid odor. In panic I triggered a 
blast at the menacing figure, and 
it, too, flopped and laid still. 

I ran my tongue over the roof 
of my dry mouth and called to 
Ven. “They’re quiet now. Come 
in and see what we’ve got.” 

“Ugh!” Ven snorted as she en- 
tered the tent at my heels. “It 
stinks!” 

“They’re not the sweetest life 
form in the universe,” I said as 
I prodded the huge mound be- 
side me, looking for reflexes that 
would indicate returning con- 
sciousness. 

“What are they?” Ven asked. 

“Mammals,” I said. 

“No wonder I thought of a 
zoo,” Ven said. “But they’re so 
big!” 

“Not on all planets,” I said. 

“Obviously,” Ven commented. 
'‘Well — what’s next? Let’s get 
this done. I’m suffocating!” 

“Hand me the probe kit,” I 
said. 

I selected two of the longest 
probes and made my way up to 
the head of the nearest monster. 
I scanned its braincase until I 
found the area I wanted and in- 



146 



GALAXY 



serted the probes, driving them 
through the heavy bone and into 
the brain beneath. I clipped on 
the short antennae and stepped 
back. “Turn the control to low,” 
I said. “Place the clips on your 
antennae. Now think of rising.” 
The bulk beside me stirred and 
Ven gave a squeak of terror. “It’s 
all right,” I assured her. “Turn 
the control back to zero. This 
one’s secure.” 

I went to the second and 
treated it like the first, and felt a 
justifiable pride as it reacted. Not 
many men could implant neuro- 
probes correctly on the first at- 
tempt. “All right, Ven. You can 
go out now. Take the controls 
with you. I’ll see what I can do 
to get these brutes out of their 
coverings.” 

The tent opening swayed as 
Ven passed through and I bent 
over the nearest form. The cover- 
ing was a heavy sack closed with 
a slide fastener much like the 
ones we used. I pulled and it 
opened, sending a flood of rank 
scent into the fetid air. I coughed, 
my eyes smarting, and found the 
fastener of the other sack. Retch- 
ing with nausea I staggered out 
of the tent. 

Ven sprang forward, caught me 
as I was about to fall, and low- 
ered me gently to the ground. 

“What are we going to do?” 
Ven asked as I lay panting at her 
feet. 



“We’re going to get them out 
of there,” I said, “and take them 
back to the ship. I didn’t come 
all this way for nothing.” I drew 
one of the controls toward me, 
fastened the clips to my antennae, 
advanced the gain and thought 
into it. There was a stir of move- 
ment inside and a huge form came 
stumbling out. It stood there clad 
in loose cloth coverings, reeking 
with halogen. I looked up at the 
dark bulk and shivered. 

“That smell!” Ven said. 

66 V|^I£ can help it a bit,” I 
** replied and turned to the 
control. With its massive fore- 
limbs the brute ripped the cloth 
from its body as it moved down- 
wind. I made it stand and took 
the other control. 

“Let me do it,” Ven said. “You 
can’t handle both of them in your 
condition.” 

“All right,” I said, “but be 
careful.” 

“I will. Now what do I do?” 

“Advance the intensity knob 
and think what you want it to 
do.” 

There was a flurry of move- 
ment inside the tent, the thrash- 
ing of a huge body, and the sec- 
ond mammal burst through the 
opening and staggered clumsily 
to a stop. 

“Reduce the intensity,” I said. 
“You’re projecting too strong a 
stimulus. Now uncover it and 



FOUNDING FATHER 



147 



send it over with the other one 
to cool off. They’re more bear- 
able when they’re cold. They 
exude the scent from their skin 
glands to compensate for tem- 
perature.” 

“I know,” Ven said. “I studied 
biology.” She did as I instructed 
and then dropped beside me. We 
relaxed, gathering our strength 
for the climb ahead. But I didn’t 
recover rapidly. I could move, but 
the exertion made me dizzy. The 
excitement was over and reaction 
had set in. “I’ll never make it,” 
I said dully. 

“I can help,” Ven said — “a 
little.” 

“It won’t be enough. You don’t 
have the strength to carry me.” 
I looked at the huge bodies of 
the mammals gleaming pallidly 
in the darkness, and suddenly I 
had an idea. The Slaads on Valga 
domesticated mammals. They 
were quadrupedal, true enough, 
but they were still mammals. 
Why couldn’t I ride one of these 
as they did? Those great masses 
of muscle should carry me easily. 
“I think I have a solution,” I 
said. 

“What?” 

“I’ll have one of them carry 
me.” 

“You can’t!” 

“Why not? They’re controlled. 
And they’re the only way I’ll be 
able to get back to the ship.” 
I picked up the nearest controller. 



“Let’s see what happens.” 

Ven squeaked as the monster 
lifted me in the air and set me 
across its neck. I crossed my pads 
and hung on. The ground seemed 
terribly far away. 

“How is it up there?” Ven 
asked. 

“A little unstable,” I said, “but 
I’ll manage. Shall we go?” 

We moved up the trail to the 
rocky abutment and turned up 
the hill. The brute beneath me 
climbed strongly and easily. 

“Wait a minute,” Ven said as 
she turned the corner behind 
me, “you’re going too fast.” 
“Why don’t you ride?” I called 
down to her. “This one moves 
easily enough. It’s much better 
than walking.” 

“I think I will,” Ven replied. 

is all right,” Ven said 
■*- as we moved side by side 
up the hill. “The fibrils on top 
of its head — ” 

“Hair,” I corrected. 

“The hair of this one is longer 
than yours. I can hold on nicely.” 
The big bodies of the natives 
moved smoothly and powerfully, 
their giant strides eating up the 
distance we had so painfully cov- 
ered some time before. Presently 
we came out onto the lower edge 
of the meadow below our ship. 

Ven looked at me, her aura 
glowing pink with excitement. 
“I’ll race you to the ship,” she 



148

jT/ c-/ 
















cried, snd dashed off with a burst 
of speed. 

Somehow I couldn’t resist the 
challenge in her voice. I advanced 
the control knob and thought 
strongly. The brute jumped as 
though it had been whipped and 
leaped into a plunging nm. I 
clung desperately for a moment 
and then relaxed as I caught the 
rhythm of the driving strides. My 
heart pounded, but not with 'fear. 

I had never known such exhilara- 
tion! Machines were pale com- 
pared to it. The mammal could 
run like a frightened skent — and 
it was faster than Yen’s! 

I caught her halfway up the 
meadow, and pulled away, exult- 
ing in the powerful muscles mov- 
ing underneath me. I charged up 
to the grove of trees that con- 
cealed our camouflaged ship, and 
brought the mammal to a halt. It 
was 'panting, trembling, drenched 
with stinking sweat, but I didn’t 
mind. I was part of it. There was 
a certain amount of feedback in 
a bipolar control circuit and I 
could feel the heat of its body, 
the beat of the great heart, the 
rise and fall of the broad chest, 
the pulse of the blood vessels in 
the thick neck. It was magnifi- 
cent! I laughed. I had never be- 
fore felt the ecstasy of physical 
strength! 

I turned and looked back, still 
tasting the pleasure of the great 
body connected to my mind. 



Yen drew up beside me. “Hai 
Yee!” she exclaimed. “What a 
sensation!” 

“You liked it?” I asked. 

“Liked it? Liked it? I loved it! 
Didn’t you?” 

“I think so,” I said truthfully. 

“I’m going across the meadow 
again,” Yen said as she turned 
her mammal around. 

“No,” I said. “We have use for 
these two and we have no knowl- 
edge of how much they can stand. 
There’s no sense damaging them.” 

I frowned as I noticed the bloody 
scratches on the legs and body 
of her mammal. 

Yen noted the direction of my 
gaze. “They’re not as tough as 
I thought,” she said with sudden 
contrition. “But they’re not too 
badly damaged, are they?” 

“No.” I said. 

I ordered the mammal to set 
me down. Dawn was breaking 
and I could see better what we 
had captured. They were a male 
and a female. On the whole, ex- 
cept for their mammalian an- 
cestry, they conformed to domi- 
nant-race criteria, being erect, 
bipedal, predatory types with 
binocular vision. Their upper 
extremities were evolved into 
manipulative organs similar to 
our primary digits. 

The most outstanding differ- 
ence was the extreme sex dimor- 
phism, which was obviously ap- 
parent in the brightening light.

GALAXY 



The physical differences were 
carried to such lengths that it was 
hard to believe that they were 
members of the same species. 

* I ■'HEY weren’t exactly ugly, yet 
■*- there was something disturb- 
ing about them. Perhaps it was 
the rank halogen odor of their 
skin glands that were still secret- 
ing despite the coolness of the air. 
Or perhaps it was merely that 
they were intelligent mammals. 
It was as though Authority had, 
in a moment of cosmic humor, 
drawn oversized caricatures of 
Thalassans and endowed them 
with life. I felt a subtle insult in 
their presence. I suppose it show- 
ed in my aura because Yen came 
quickly to my side. 

“I told you they were disturb- 
ing,” she said as we looked up at 
their monstrous forms towering 
over us. 

“I’m glad they’re not uncon- 
trolled,” I answered, shivering a 
little as I looked at them. “I 
suppose it’s just species antipa- 
thy, but they make me uncom- 
fortable.” 

“Mammals were exterminated 
on Thalassa long ago, weren’t 
they?” 

“Yes,” I said. “They ate our 
eggs.” 

Yen walked forward and ran 
her primary digits over the fe- 
male’s legs. “They’re quite well 
evolved,” she said. “The skin 



hasn’t a vestige of scales.” 
“Neither does yours except at 
the tip of your tail,” I said tartly. 
“Don’t get the idea that they’re 
a primitive life form. Actually 
they are a later evolutionary type 
than we! If our ancestors had not 
developed intelligence enough to 
realize their peril we would be 
extinct — and something like 
them would rule Thalassa to- 
day.” 

Yen shivered, “How horrible! 

I don’t like thinking about it.” 
“Don’t,” I advised. 

“What are we going to do 
with them?” Yen asked. 

“I was going to analyze them 
and construct a proxy, but they’re 
far too big to duplicate with our 
limited resources. I suppose the 
only thing we can do is to insert 
control circuits and use them as 
they are.” 

“Won’t that be painful?” 

“Only psychically. Physically 
they shouldn’t suffer a bit. The 
brain, you know, feels no pain. It 
merely interprets stimuli from 
elsewhere.” 

“In mammals too?” 

I shrugged. “I suppose so. Be- . 
sides, what difference does it 
make? Once we’re through with 
them we can destroy them if 
they’re too badly damaged.” 

“That seems unfair.” 

“It’s not a question of fairness. 
It’s survival. If they don’t per- 
form properly, we shall have to 



FOUNDING FATHER 



151 



dispose of them or they’ll be back 
here with a whole herd. Of course, 
if they operate under control, 
we’ll turn them loose when we’re 
through with them. I doubt that 
their technology is advanced 
enough to recognize a bio-circuit 
if they saw one. And if it is, they 
will have learned nothing new.” 

“But why can’t we keep them 
— take them back to Thalassa? 
They’d make an unusual contribu- 
tion to the Central Zoo.” 

“I’m afraid not,” I said. “I 
doubt if they’d survive space. The 
only part of the ship large enough 
to hold them would be the cargo 
storage compartment, and that’s 
not shielded. A hyperjump would 
kill them. You wouldn’t want 
even them to die that way, would 
you?” 

Her aura turned gray. “No, I 
suppose not.” 

“There isn’t a chance,” I said, 
seizing her thought before it was 
uttered. “It would take ten of our 
lifetimes to reach our nearest out- 
post on normal spacedrive. Forget 
it.” 

“But^” 

“Come along,” I said, “I’ll need 
your help to modify these brutes.” 

A CTUALLY it wasn’t a hard 
■^job. Their brains were well 
developed and nicely compart- 
mentalized. With our probes and 
instruments it was a simple 
enough matter to implant the 



necessary organic extensions of 
our instruments. 

“That should do it,” I mur- 
mured as I disconnected the leads 
I had jury-rigged into the ana- 
lyzer. “They’re clean as a Far- 
del’s tooth.” I was tired, but I 
had the pleasant feeling of ac- 
complishment that comes from 
working with organic matter. 
Possibly if I were not so inter- 
ested in History, I’d have become 
a medic. I do have a certain talent 
along that line. 

At any rate, we now had a 
pair of proxies. With only nor- 
mal fortune they would be com- 
pletely undetectable. 

“Is it all done?” Ven asked as 
she looked over my shoulder. 

“Yes,” I said. “But leave the 
probes in place until we test 
them.” I dragged my weary body 
once again into the control room 
and tried the headgear and cir- 
cuits. They functioned absolutely 
perfectly. 

“What do we do now?” Yen’s 
projection came to me. 

“Remove the probes and send 
them back to their camp. There’s 
no sense in leaving them here.” 

“But Eu— ” 

“No,” I said. “They are not 
toys. They’re tools. They’re to 
do a job for us. Now stop acting 
like a child. When they bring 
us metal you can play games with 
them — but not now. They’re 
stressed, tired, and need rest. 



152 



GALAXY 



And they’re going to get it.” 
“Yes, Eu.” Her projection was 
submissive. 

“But don’t worry,” I added 
kindly. “You can monitor them. 
I installed two extra circuits, one 
to the hypothalamus and the 
other to the tactile centers. You 
will be able to feel every sen- 
sation they experience. It will be 
just like having an extra body.” 
“Can I try it now?” she asked 
eagerly as she came into the con- 
trol room. 

“Go ahead,” I said. “Put on a 
helmet and use the double con- 
trol. Take them back to their 
camp and then neutralize the 
controller. As for me, I’m going 
to the refresher. I need it.” 

Ill 

T awoke from partial estivation 
with Yen’s projection vibrating 
my antennae. “Eu! Come quickly! 
They’re awake!” 

I groaned. What did she ex- 
pect? But it might be interesting 
to see how they behaved. And if 
they panicked, someone should 
be there to assume control. 

I checked the chronometer. I 
had rested for eight satts which 
should be enough. I felt as well 
as could be expected, so with only 
a few choice Low-Thalassic ex- 
pletives to help me I managed to 
clamber out of the tank and 
stagger into the control room. 



Yen already had one of the hel- 
mets on. I picked up the other 
and flicked the switch to “on.” It 
was the male’s — and he was 
talking. The words were gibber- 
ish, but the thoughts behind them 
were easy to read. 

I was part of an entity called 
Donald G. Carlton, a male mam- 
mal of the human species. He 
was a “writer” and was mated to 
the female, who was called Edith 
and who worked in “motion pic- 
tures.” They lived in a place 
called Holl3Twood, in a family 
unit structure faintly similar to 
a children’s creche. Custom on 
this world dictated that the fe- 
male take one name of her mate, 
which indicated that the sex was 
even more subservient than fe- 
male Thalassans. The male’s 
body ached, but not as badly as 
I would have expected. And, as I 
exp>ected, there was no sensitivity 
in the brain. 

“Hey! Edith!” Donald said. 
“Get up!” 

“Leave me alone, Don. I’m 
miserable,” a lighter voice an- 
swered from the lumpy sack be- 
side him. “I had the most awful 
dream.” 

“It must be the mountain air,” 
he replied. “I did too.” 

“Whatever made me think this 
would be fun!” Edith said. “You 
and your meteor-hunting!” The 
sack heaved and twisted and her 
head appeared at one end. “I 



FOUNDING FATHER 



153 



feel like I’ve been worked over 
with a baseball bat. Oh! My 
legs!” 

“You’re not alone,” he said. 
“I guess it’s the hard ground and 
these strait-jackets they laugh- 
ingly call sleeping bags.” 

“About that dream,” Edith 
said. “It was horrible. There was 
this little green and yellow thing 
that looked like a cross between 
a lizard and a human being. It 
was sitting on my shoulders and 
I was naked — carrying it around, 
doing what it wanted me to do! 
I wanted to throw it off and 
stamp on it but I couldn’t. I just 
ran and ran and all the time 
that little monster sat with its 
legs around my neck, hooting like 
an owl. Now, wasn’t that some- 
thing?” 

Donald was very quiet. “You 
know,” he said slowly, “essen- 
tially that was the same dream I 
had.” 

“But that can’t be! People 
don’t have the same nightmares.” 

“We did.” 

“Then maybe — maybe it 
wasn’t a nightmare!” 

“Nonsense. We’re here. We’re 
all right. But I think perhaps 
we’d better get out of here - — 
oh, Keerist! I’m one solid bruise.” 
He twisted around until he found 
the fastenings and op>ened the 
bag. With a groan he stood up. 

Edith looked at him, her eyes 
wide with sudden terror. “Don,” 



she said in a brittle voice, didn’t 
you wear pajamas when you went 
to bed last night?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, you’re not wearing them 
now.” An expression of horror 
crossed her face. “And neither am 
I,” she added in a small voice. 

T could feel the shock in Donald’s 
■*- brain as he looked down at 
himself. “That’s not all I’m not 
wearing,” he said dully. “I’m 
shaved!” 

There was a brief flurry inside 
the other sleeping bag. “So am 
I!” Edith’s voice was a whisper 
of fright. “That was no dream! I 
remember this. The lizard gave 
me something that I rubbed all 
over myself — and my hair came 
off. I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t 
help myself.” Her hands went to 
her head and she sighed, “Well, 
that’s all there. For a moment I 
thought — ” 

“My skin is different,” Donald 
interrupted thoughtfully as he 
inspected himself. “It feels 
thicker. And I don’t feel cold, 
although I’ll bet it’s nearly freez- 
ing outside.” 

“Don! Don’t you understand? 
That dream was real!” Edith 
said. 

“Of course it was, — unless 
this is a dream. We could be 
having a nightmare about a night- 
mare . 

I looked at Ven. 



154 



GALAXY 



“Just what did you do to 
them?” I asked. 

She glowed guiltily. “I didn’t 
know it would take their hair 
off,” she said. “I was worried 
about their scratches, and the in- 
sects were biting them. So I made 
them rub on some of our skin con- 
ditioner.” 

I raised my digits toward the 
sky. “There is an Authority that 
looks over fools and Thalassan 
females,” I said. “What made 
you so sure our conditioner would 
work on them? It might have 
been poisonous.” 

“I tried it on the male first,” 
Ven said. 

“Genius,” I breathed with icy 
sarcasm, “sheer genius!” 

“Well,” she said, “it worked!” 
The eternal pragmatist had 
applied her sole criterion. “And 
what’s more they looked and 
smelled lots better after they 
used it.” 

I shrugged, gave it up and 
turned my attention back to the 
mammals. 

Edith had emerged from her 
sack and was standing before the 
male. 

“Do I look like a nightmare?” 
she demanded. 

“No. More like a skinned 
rabbit — ouch! What did you do 
that for?” He rubbed his face 
where she struck him with her 
digits. 

“There!” Edith said. “Now do 



you think it’s a dream?” 
“I never did,” he replied 
mildly. “I’ve never dreamed in 
my life. I was just breaking it 
to you easy. It was real enough 
— even the blank spaces. I 
wonder - — ” 

“You wonder what?” 

“What their reason was for 
capturing us and then letting us 
go. It doesn’t make sense. They 
wouldn’t grab us just for fun. 
They’re obviously intelligent, and 
probably thought we would be 
useful to them. But they turned 
us loose. So we couldn’t be useful 
except maybe for amusement — 
but that doesn’t jell. No. They’ve 
done something to us. They’ve 
let us go for a reason.” 

660TOP analyzing!” Edith said. 

^ “Why don’t you just get 
scared, like I am!” 

“I am,” he said, “but I like to 
figure things out. If I know what 
frightens me, it doesn’t bother me 
so much.” 

“Do that while we’re on the 
way home. Get your clothes on 
and let’s get out of here! Right 
away!” 

“We have to pack.” 

“Oh, leave it! Let’s get out 
while we can!” 

“I don’t think we’re in any 
danger,” he said. 

“Well — I don’t want to stay 
here a minute longer!” 

“All right. We’ll go. But we’ll 



FOUNDING FATHER 



155 



pack first. Look at it logically. 
They had us cold. We didn’t 
escape. We were let go. So why, 
if they didn’t want us then, should 
they want us now?” 

“Unless they can get us any 
time they want us.” 

“You have a point there, but 
if that’s the case, they can get 
us anyway. So let’s pack.” 

“You can pack if you want to. 
I’m leaving!” Edith pulled the 
opening to the tent and slipped 
out. 

“Edith!” Donald cried. “Wait!” 

I touched Ven. “Stop her,” I 
said. 

Edith’s voice came from out- 
side. “Don!” she called in a tight 
voice. “Don! Help me! I can’# 
move!" 

“Try coming back here and 
see what happens,” Donald said 
slowly. 

Edith’s head appeared in the 
entrance. “I’m back,” she said 
in a small voice. 

'“I thought you would be. Now 
let’s pack and perhaps they’l^ 
let us go. It’s obvious that we 
can’t run away.” 

“But why? What’s happened 
to us?" 

“If I told you, you’d think I’m 
crazy.” 

“Tell me anyway. It can’t be 
any worse than this.” 

^T think,” Donald said slowly 
as he began to roll up his 
sleeping bag, “that we were 



kidnapped by extraterrestrials.” 

“Martians?” 

“Not necessarily,” he said. 
“But if I remember my night- 
mare correctly, they aren’t 
human — and they are obviously 
smart. So they aren’t of this earth. 
We don’t have intelligent reptiles 
here. And with their ability to 
control our actions, I’d say that 
they were from a considerably 
higher culture than ours. They’ve 
done things to us — but I don’t 
think they did them just for fun. 
They want us to do some- 
thing.” 

“What?” 

“I don’t know. Right now I’d 
guess they want us to pack our 
things. Let’s do it and get out 
of here. This place smells like the 
reptile house in the zoo!” 

T was amazed. The native’s 
-*• analysis was as logical as my 
own would have been under 
similar circumstances. There was 
nothing wrong with his mind or 
with his courage. That big brain- 
case held a smoothly functioning 
mind and a cold courage I could 
almost envy. In a similar fix I 
wasn’t sure that I could be so 
calm. 

My respect for him mounted. 
If there were others like him on 
this world, his race could be a 
potential danger spot for the 
whole Galaxy. And, with the 
natural antipathy between our 



156 



GALAXY 



races, these creatures could be 
trouble if they ever reached space. 
I wondered for a moment if 
Authority had known this when 
It brought me here. There must 
be some design that !■ should 
land here when this race was still 
capable of being frustrated. 

For the sake of civilization I 
would have to learn more about 
these mammals. Much more. But 
since the male had deduced so 
much, there was only one logical 
course of action. I adjusted the 
filters ort my helmet to allow the 
passage of surface thoughts, 
twisted the dials on the con- 
troller until the meters balanced 
and projected gently. 

“Donald — listen to me,” I 
said.. 

He stiffened. “I thought you 
would be somewhere around,” he 
said. “Who are you?” 

“My name is Eu Kor, and I am 
a native of Thalassa.” 

“Where’s that?” 

“A good many spatial units 
from here — a good many of 
your light years,” I amended. “I 
mean you no harm, but I need 
your cooperation. My spaceship 
is crippled. Our fuel has dete- 
riorated. We need more and I 
want you to get it for us. We 
captured you because we need 
your help. Being a native you 
would not make a ripple in this 
society. And we would create 
whirlpools.” 



“What is this material you 
want?” 

“A metal. Atomic number 50, 
a white metal used as an alloy 
component of primitive metallic 
cultures,” I said. “It shouldn’t be 
too hard to get.” I didn’t realize 
how hard it was to describe what 
I wanted. I wasn’t getting 
through, and it bothered me. 
The culture barrier was almost 
as bad as though we couldn’t 
contact mind to mind. 

“I think you mean tin,” he 
said. I grasped the concept and 
it seemed right. 

“Bring me some and I will run 
tests,” I said. 

“And what do I get in re- 
turn?” 

T thought quickly. If he wanted 

to bargain perhaps we could 
reach an agreement. It’s always 
better to have a cooperative 
proxy. They don’t cause nearly 
the trouble in management. And 
I had other things to do than 
monitor natives. There was a 
great deal of repair work to be 
done on the ship before she would 
fly again. The subspace radio 
power bank had to be rebuilt 
and the circuits should be 
checked. 

“I can give you knowledge 
that you wouldn’t have for dec- 
ades — maybe centuries,” I 
said. “And I can adjust your 
bodies for a longer and happier 



FOUNDING FATHER 



157 



life.” I shot a glance at Ven still 
immersed in her helmet. In fact, 

I have made a few adjustments 
already.” 

“So I noticed,” Donald thought 
dryly. “Although whether they’re 
an improvement or not I couldn t 
say. But did you have to go to 
all this trouble?” 

“Think of us — and discount 
the fact that you carried us be- 
cause our bodies are too weak for 
your heavy world.” I said. “Did 
you like us?” 

“No,” he said. “You repelled 
me. I disliked you on sight, more 
than I can say.” 

“The emotion is mutual,” I 
said. “Yet I can endure you. But 
with your glandular outlook you 
could only think of destroying 
us.” 

“That is true. But you treated 
us like animals.” 

“You are animals,” I said 
logically. 

“We are masters of this world. 
We recognize no higher author- 
ity. We are free people — not 
slaves. And unless we are treated 
as free agents you will get no 
cooperation from us.” 

“I can force you to do as I 
wish,” I said. 

“Prove it!” 

I took over. And while Donald 
watched with helpless horror 
his hand picked up a knife 
and drew it across his arm. 
The keen edge split the tissues 



neatly and the blood flowed. 

“Don! What are you doing!” 
Edith screamed and then stif- 
fened as Ven took control. 

“Observe,” I said as I released 
control. 

“Why, you — ” Donald began 

— and then continued in a tone 
of wonder. “Why — the cut’s 
closing! There’s no more blood 

— It’s gone!” 

“It’s just one of the improve- 
ments I mentioned,” I said 
smugly. “You also had a patch of 
scar tissue on your left lung and 
infected kidneys. You do not 
have them now. Had you not met 
us you would have been dead 
within five of your years.” 

H e was shaken. I could feel it. 

“I do have Bright’s disease,” 
he said thoughtfully. 

“You had it,” I corrected. 

“All right,” he said suddenly, 
“I’ll bargain with you. You’ve 
done me a good turn and it de- 
serves a payment. I’ll help you 
get your metal.” He grinned rue- 
fully. “I guess I couldn’t do 
anything else.” 

“It makes it easier this way,” 
I said. I smiled to myself. I was 
telling him the truth, but not all 
of it. Nor did I trust him. There 
was fear and hatred in his lower 
centers, and a formless feeling in 
his upjjer levels that he could 
outsmart any damn lizard that 
ever lived. He didn’t realize 



158 



GALAXY 



i 



that I could read his surface 
thoughts. 

“Just remember,” I said, “I 
can control you completely, if 
necessary, and pick your brain 
for data whether you wish it or 
not. And forget those ideas of in- 
forming your authorities about us. 
Except with your mate you can- 
not communicate to anyone about 
us. There’s a basic block in your 
brain that will result in irrever- 
sible mental damage if you try.” 
This last was not quite the 
''truth. But I hoped that by es- 
tablishing fear I would prevent 
talk. “Now find us samples of the 
metal I want.” I withdrew and 
went back to scanning. 

“What was going on there?” 
Edith said. “You were talking to 
empty air. And why did you cut 
yourself?” 

“It was one of our reptilian 
friends,” Don said. “Like I 
thought, they’re right with us — 
every way. He’s a weird sort. 

; Wants to trade health and knowl- 
\ edge for tin.” 

“Tin?” 

“Yeah. At least I think it’s tin. 
\ His description of the metal fits. 
They use it instead of rocket 
juice.” 

“But that knife — your arm?” 

“Look. No cut — no blood. 
That’s one of the things they did 
to us. We’ve got puncture-proof 
skin.” 

“Is that good?” 



FOUNDING FATHER 



“It isn’t bad. And I don’t think 
I’ll ever have to shave again. As 
I remember I put that stuff on 
my face. Anyway, we now have 
a couple of fairy godmothers 
who ride around in spaceships 
instead of pumpkin coaches.” 
“You’re mixing your stories,” 
Edith said. “Cinderella travelled 
in the pumpkin coach, not her 
fairy godmother. And besides, it’s 
not funny. We’re more like those 
poor souls in the Middle Ages 
who were possessed by devils — 
incubuses, I think they called 
them.” 

“It makes no difference what 
you call them,” Donald said in- 
differently. “Whatever they are, 
we’ve got them and they’re not 
going to leave until they’re damn 
good and ready. Incidentally, 
yoiirs is a female, so she’s proba- 
bly a succubus. Now don’t start 
screaming. You’ll probably be 
paralyzed if you do.” 

“I won’t scream,” Edith said 
dully. “I’m too numb to scream.” 

IV 

"V^E had surprisingly little 
” trouble with the two natives 
once they realized we could con- 
trol them if we wished. Of the 
two, Edith was the worst. She 
refused to cooperate and had to 
be forced into the simplest ac- 
tions. 

“We’re going to have trouble 



159 



with that one,” I observed as Ven 
looked at me with faint exaspera- 
tion in her yellow eyes. 

“Oh, I don’t think so,” she said. 
“Not really. This is a normal fe- 
male reaction. It’s a phase. Like 
the way I felt when the Eugenics 
Council selected me to be your 
mate.” 

“Did you feel like that?” I 
asked with surprise. 

“Of course. I wanted to make 
my own choice.” 

“But you never told me.” 

“There was no need. I came 
around to the Council’s view be- 
fore I met you. And Edith will 
come around to mine. Don’t 
worry. I know how to handle 
this.” 

And she did. 

I helped a little by altering a 
few reflex arcs and basic attitudes, 
but Ven wouldn’t allow me to 
modify the higher centers. 

“There’s no need to make her 
a mindless idiot,” Ven said. “You 
didn’t do that to Donald.” 

“Yes, but Donald controls his 
emotions. He doesn’t like me any 
better than Edith likes you, but 
he doesn’t work himself into an 
emotional homogenate every time 
I make a suggestion. We argue 
it out like rational intelligences. 
Often I can use his experience 
and viewpoint. And when I can’t 
agree, he will cooperate rather 
than operate under control. He’s 
not like that bundle of glands 



and emotions you are trying to 
make into a useful proxy.” 

“She is a problem,” Ven ad- 
mitted, “but if I had her here 

“That can be arranged,” I said. 
“I’ll give you two weeks. And if 
that doesn’t work you let me 
perform a prefrontal block.” 
“That isn’t very long.” 

“That’s all we can afford, I told 
her. 

“All right, I can try. In a month 
I know I could do it.” 

Donald protested violently 
when I told him what we plan- 
ned for Edith, but when I gave 
him the alternative, he reluc- 
tantly agreed. 

He passed a story that Edith 
would be visiting friends, and 
brought her to the ship. 

At once Ven went systemat- 
ically to work to reduce the 
mammal to an acquiescent state 
that would permit control. Since 
sleep is unknown to our race but 
necessary for mammals, the task 
of breaking down the female’s 
resistance was simplified by 
physical exhaustion. Ven also 
found that the mammal’s sleep- 
ing time could be used to 
strengthen the new reflex chan- 
nels built during her waking pe- 
riods. The results were amazing, 
even to me, and I’m fairly well 
trained in neuromanipulation. 
Halfway through the second 
week the mammal’s surrender 
was complete.

4 NOTHER day and she can 
go back,” Ven said. “I can 
finish her training at long range. 
Now that I have the channels 
established, I don’t think she’ll 
be any further trouble.” 

I took the helmet and scan- 
ned Edith. “Hmm,” I said. “Do 
you know what you’ve done? 
You’ve built yourself into an 
Authority image.” 

“I know,” Ven said smugly. 
“She is essentially a dependent 
type. Her mate was her decision 
maker. That’s why I had to get 
her alone. It wasn’t too hard once 
I knew where to look. As a girl, 
her mother made the decisions 
for her. As a woman, Donald has 
done it. And when I faced her 
with situations where she had to 
decide and where the decisions 
were invariably wrong, she trans- 
ferred the decision-making power 
to me.” 

I looked at her sharply. “I had 
no idea that you intended to 
make a pet out of her,” I said. 
“Otherwise I wouldn’t have per- 
mitted this.” 

“Well, it’s too late now. And 
besides, it was the only way I 
could do it in the time you 
allotted. But don’t worry. She’ll 
be as good a tool as your pre- 
cious Donald — maybe even a 
better one — because she’ll do 
things to please me and not 
merely because they’re expe- 
dient.” 



Ven had a point there. But it 
isn’t a good policy to get emotion- 
ally involved with alien races. 
However, the deed was done, and 
as long as Ven was happy I 
didn’t care. I only hoped that she 
wouldn’t become too attached to 
the creature. 

Donald I was much more coop- 
erative and much tougher. He 
had realized from the start that 
there was no profit in objecting 
to my demands. But, unlike 
Edith, he gave me no handle for 
leverage. He arranged his life to 
include the unpleasant fact of my 
existence, and that was that. 
Where Ven achieved a form of 
mastery, I never received anything 
more than acquiescence. There 
were levels in Donald I could 
not touch. At first it irked me, 
but then I realized that I was 
the greater gainer. For Donald 
was a constant challenge, a de- 
light to the mind, an outward 
collaborator and an inward 
enemy. Our relationship had all 
the elements of an armed truce. 
And I often thought that if I 
did not have the crushing ad- 
vantage of control, our contest 
might have been more even. 

Although in time Donald’s 
hatred became modified to a 
grim sort of tolerance, and his 
repulsion into something that 
closely resembled admiration, he 
never lost the basic species an- 
tipathy which separated us. And 



FOUNDING FATHER 



161 



in that regard our feelings were 
mutual. The ancient Thalassan 
proverb that familiarity breeds 
friendship simply didn’t apply. 
We held a mutual respect for each 
other, and in a fashion we coop- 
erated, but I never could pierce 
the armor of resentment that 
shielded him. I tried, but finally I 
gave up. There would never be 
friendship between us. We. were 
too different — 

And too alike. 

I’N the days that followed the 
first contact, I proceeded ac- 
cording to approved methods of 
investigating alien civilizations. 
At my request, Donald went to 
the local book repository and we 
went through a number of works 
on law, government, social struc- 
ture, and finance. I felt that I 
should have some knowledge of 
this mammalian culture before 
attempting to refuel the ship. 
There was no sense in calling 
attention to myself any more 
than necessary. If I could obtain 
what I wanted and leave quietly, 
I would be perfectly happy. This 
world was of interest — but it 
was too disturbing to contem- 
plate for an extended period of 
time. 

“You were right, Eu Kor,” Ven 
said to me as we scanned the 
pattern of the mammals’ culture. 
“If you had picked any place 
less isolated than this, we might 



have been engulfed in that mael- 
Strom.” 

I nodded. “It was more luck 
than design,” I said, “but I am 
happy that we are no closer. This 
world is not for us. It is too 
strange, too alien with its uncon- 
trolled emotionalism and fright- 
ening energy.” 

“It reminds me of a malignant 
neoplasm,” Ven said, “growing 
uncontrolled, destroying the body 
from which it draws sustenance. 
Have you ever seen such a seeth- 
ing flux of people — such 
growth - — such appalling waste 
and carelessness?” 

I shook my head. “The only 
parallel that comes to mind is 
Sennor.” 

“But that’s a dead world — 
killed by a suicidal race that 
achieved technology before it had 
attained culture.” 

“Which is precisely the situa- 
tion we have here. Or have you 
observed their social inequities 
and history? Periodically these 
mammals erupt in merciless riots 
and slaughters over things that 
cotild be settled by reason. And 
oddly enough, these ‘wars’ as 
humans call them have the effect 
of stimulating technology. This is 
a race that apparently loves death 
and battle. A barbaric horde of 
cultural morons, with a civilized 
technology geared to mutual 
destruction.” 

“Frankly, I’ve been scanning 



162 



GALAXY 



through Edith. I’ve seen only the 
technical excellence of their en- 
tertainment industry, and the 
enormous waste which goes into 
the making of one of their pro- 
ductions.” 

“We must have a synthesis,” 
I said, “and pool our observa- 
tions.” 

Ven nodded. 

“I’m not at all happy about 
this place,” I continued. “It makes 
me uncomfortable.” 

“Could we modify it?” Ven 
asked. 

I shook my head. “It would 
take an entire task force to do 
that. Reeducation of this culture 
would have to begin at birth 
after appropriate culling. We 
would have to start from the 
beginning. I fear that the council 
would never authorize such an 
action on behalf of mammals. 
We are altruistic . * but not 
that altruistic.” 

“Then they will destroy them- 
selves?” 

“I fear so. This culture has a 
poor prognosis. But it is perhaps 
better so. Or would you like to 
see them roaming through the 
Galaxy?” 

Ven shuddered. “Not as they 
are now. Not these fierce, com- 
bative stupid brutes. Individuals 
perhaps, but not the race. They 
would have to learn the rules of 
civilization first.” 

“Yet they show no sign of 



learning. If they can’t even coop- 
erate with their own species, how 
in Authority’s name could they 
ever get along with the dissimilar 
races of this island universe?” 

“They couldn’t. We would have 
to quarantine them.” 

“So isn’t it better to save the 
expense and let them quarantine 
themselves?” 

“I suppose so.” Ven’s aura was 
a dull gray and mine matched 
the gloom of hers. It is hard to 
stand aloof and watch a race 
condemn itself to death. 

Vj^E fed our observations into 
the analyzer, together with 
all extraneous data we could lay 
our digits on via our proxies — 
not to prove our conclusions but 
to determine the means by 
which we could obtain the power 
metal with the least possible re- 
percussions in this society. We 
both realized it would be fatal to 
expose ourselves. The mamma- 
lian technology was sufficiently 
advanced for them to duplicate 
the essential portions of our ship, 
and chaos could result if they 
secured a road to the stars. Gen- 
erations of effort would be re- 
quired to confine them again to 
their homeworld. 

Thinking in this manner 
caused me to take certain pre- 
cautions with the drive mechan- 
ism that would ensure no trace 
of our craft remaining if I pro- 



FOUNDING FATHER 



163 



jected a certain impulse at a given 
strength. Ven, of course, was ap- 
palled at my action, although she 
■realized its grim necessity. 

And in the meantime we 
worked with our proxies, I at- 
tempting to establish some means 
of quietly obtaining the metal 
we needed, and Ven doing nothing 
so far as I could determine that 
would further our mission. At 
that, Edith was in no position to 
obtain metal, and Ven was too 
young and inexperienced in con- 
tact work to attempt a mission 
of such delicacy. Since Edith 
amused her, I was content to 
leave them both to their own 
devices while I worked -with 
Donald to speed our departure. 

“In this society,” I said to 
Donald, “it seems that one can 
accomplish anything with this 
medium of exchange you call 
money.” 

“That’s close to a fundamental 
truth,” Donald replied. 

“And you are not too well 
supplied with it?” I asked. 

“Those four ingots I brought 
you last week put a vicious dent 
in our savings account.” 

“Isn’t your trade as an author 
profitable?” 

“Only in spurts. It’s a feast- 
famine existence. But it’s the only 
one I care to lead.” 

“But popular fiction makes 
money — and you can write.” 

“I wish you’d tell that to my 



agent. He seems to have other 
ideas.” 

“I have recently read some of 
your fiction,” I said, “and have 
noticed that it has certain basics 
that could easily be applied to an 
analyzer. There is no reason why 
we could not cooperate and prod- 
uce a work that would yield a 
great deal of money.” 

Donald laughed. “Now I’ve 
heard everything!” he said. “You 
mean to tell me you could write 
a book humans would buy?” 

“No, you would write the book. 
I would merely furnish the idea, 
the research data, the plot, and 
the general story outline. In your 
popular fiction,” I continued, 
“there are four basic elements 
and a plot that can be varied 
about twenty-five ways. There is 
small need for philosophy and 
little need for abstract thought. 
In fact, there is no need at all for 
anything but glandular excitation. 
All that is really necessary is 
plenty of action, enough under- 
standing of the locale and events 
to avoid anachronism — and the 
basics.” 

V|7TIAT are these basics?” 
** Donald said. “As a writer 
I’d like to know them.” 

“There are four,” I ticked 
them off on my digits. “First, 
violation of the ethical or moral 
code of your race; second, ade- 
quate amounts of cohabitation 



164 



GALAXY 



L between the characters; third, 
^ brutality; and fourth — murder- 
ous assault.” 

“Hmm. Sin, sex, sadism and 
( I slaughter,” Donald commented. 

“You know, you might have 
j something there.” 
j “I have prepared an outline 
and a synopsis of such a book,” 
! I said. “It is a historical novel. 

It should sell. Most historical 
1 novels do.” 

“You’ve done what?” Donald 
1 gasped. Then he laughed. “Of all 
the insufferable egoists I’ve ever 
seen!” 

“Listen,” I said, ordering him 
to silence while I outlined the 
opening chapter. 

“I can’t stop you,” Donald said. 
“But why should this happen to 
me? Isn’t it bad enough to be 
* bossed around by you lizards 
without having to be forced to 
ghost-write your amateur literary 
efforts?” 

“It is laid in the period of your 
history called the Renaissance,” 
I continued, “and deals with a 
; young man of a noble but im- 
; poverished house who rose to 
j power by cleverness, amorality 
and skill with the sword.” 

“I suppose the girl is the 
daughter of the local duke.” 

“No,” I said, “she is the favor- 
ite wife of a Saracen corsair.” 

“Well, that’s a switch,” Donald 
said. “Tell me more.” 

So I did. I outlined the open- 



ing and told him the major points 
of the whole story ... as the 
computer had synthesized it out 
of seven excellent novels of the 
period and a four-volume set of 
Renaissance history. 

Donald was enthralled. “You’re 
right,” he said. “It will sell. It’s 
lousy literature, but it’s got ap- 
peal. With this story and my 
writing we can out-Spillane 
Mickey.” He was more enthusi- 
astic than I had ever seen him 
appear before. 

“Who is Spillane?” I asked. 

Donald looked at me as though 
he thought I was crazy and shook 
his head. “I can get to work on 
it as soon as I get home,” Donald 
said. “And if I keep at it, it’ll be 
ready for mailing in a couple of 
weeks. I’ll get it off to my agent 
and we’ll see. I hate to admit it, 
but I think you’re right about the 
yarn. It should sell like hotcakes.” 

“That is fine. It should provide 
us with the medium of exchange, 
which is necessary in this so- 
ciety.” 

“It’s not necessary,” Donald 
grinned. “It’s essential.” 

V 

T^ONALD’S prediction was a 
■*^a good one. The book sold — 
and sold well. Despite the out- 
right plagiarism of ideas -and 
source material it was hailed as 
a new novel — one that stimu- 



FOUNDING FATHER 



165 



lated thought with its realistic 
approach to the life of the times. 
And we prospered amazingly. 

With the advance money, I 
had Donald buy the land on 
which the ship was resting, to- 
gether with the valley and rim- 
rock. Having thus secured our 
landing site I felt a bit more com- 
fortable. The comfort was even 
greater when, at Donald’s sug- 
gestion, a fence was placed around 
the property and electronic tell- 
tales were installed. The re- 
mainder of the royalties were 
used to purchase tin and supplies. 

But despite our prosperity and 
the regular supply of tin that 
came to me as a result of my 
adventure in fiction, and the cer- 
tainty that Ven and I would be 
leaving, Donald was not happy. 

As a successful new author he 
had to travel to meetings in 
various cities. He had to speak at 
public gatherings. He had to meet 
with publishers eager to receive 
rights to his next book. And Edith 
did not go with him. 

Ven was adamant on this point. 
“It’s bad enough that she is 
working on this motion picture,” 
she said, “but I’m not going to 
have her traveling all over the 
face of this planet. She’s the only 
amusement I have since we must 
stay cooped up in this place. I’m 
not going to let her go.” 

Donald was upset about it He 
was so angry that he came to 



visit me voluntarily, and the sight 
of Edith’s little car parked under 
the trees below the ship infuriated 
him even more. It took the con- 
troller to make him keep his 
distance as he stood in front of 
the airlock and hated me. 

“Damn you!” he swore. “You 
can’t do this to me! Edith’s my 
wife and I don’t like this rela- 
tionship between her and that — 
that dinosaur! It isn’t healthy.” 
“It’s out of rhy hands,” I said. 
“Edith is Yen’s responsibility.” 
“It’s not only that,” he raged. 
“Ever since you lizards butted 
into our lives Edith looks at me 
like I was a stranger.” His face 
twisted. “I’ll admit she has her 
reasons. But that gives her no call 
to ask Yen’s advice rather than 
mine. When I told her I wanted 
her to come with me, the first 
thing she said was that she’d ask 
Ven. She doesn’t do one damn 
thing without that cold-blooded 
little monster’s consent! She even 
asks advice on what clothes she 
should wear!” He laughed 
harshly. “The blind asking advice 
from the blind!” 

T couldn’t help chuckling. Ven, 
like all Thalassans, had never 
worn anything in her life except 
a utility belt. Clothing has never 
been a feature of our culture. 
Since it isn’t necessary on Thalas- 
sa, it was never developed, and 
since our sex impulses are pe- 



166 



GALAXY 



riodic it has never been useful 
to attract either males or females. 
“I can see your point,” I said. 
“Yen’s ideas along that line 
would be zero.” 

“Not quite,” Donald said 
angrily. “She likes moccasins. 
Apparently they make feet look 
more like your pads.” 

“Well?” 

“But that’s it! Edith’s idea of 
what a well-dressed housewife 
should wear is — moccasins! She 
damn near caused a riot the other 
day when our TV repairman 
called to fix the set. We’ll be 
lucky if we’re not forced to move 
because of that little incident!” 
“I’ll speak to Ven,” I said. 
“And if that doesn’t work. I’ll 
insert a block against such a 
thing happening again. I don’t 
want special attention called to 
you. That sort of thing will stop 
right now.” 

“Thanks,” Donald said. “But 
I should be the one to stop it.” 
“Face it,” I replied, “you 
aren’t. Not now. But you will be 
once we’re gone.” 

“Which can’t be too soon to 
suit me,” he said. “I spend every 
spare moment collecting tin for 
you. Edie doesn’t. She wants Ven 
to stay.” 

“They seem to be happy with 
each other. Edith comes up here 
regularly.” 

“I know,” he said bitterly. 
“She’s here more often than 



she’s home. I can’t see what fun 
she gets out of running around 
these hills stripped to the skin 
carrying your mate on her shoul- 
ders.” 

“I wouldn’t know,” I said. 
“Certainly you never seem to 
enjoy performing that service 
for me.” 

“I don’t even like the thought 
of it. I’m not an animal, 
after all.” 

“But you are,” I said. “So am I. 
The only difference is that I am 
a superior animal and you, being 
inferior, conform to my wishes. 
It is a law of nature that the 
superior type will inevitably rule. 
The inferior either conforms or 
dies. And you have no desire to 
die.” 

He shook his head. “But I can 
still object,” he said. 

“At that?” I asked pointing 
across the meadow with a pri- 
mary digit. 

Edith was running, her long 
yellow hair floating free behind 
her. Ven, high on her shoulders 
in a seat the two of them had 
contrived, waved gaily at us as 
they came up. Edith was flushed 
and laughing. Her eyes sparkled 
and her smooth bronze body 
gleamed in the sunlight. She low- 
ered Ven to the ground, slipped 
the harness off her smooth shoul- 
ders and stood behind my mate, 
breathing deeply but not at all 
distressed.

167 



Donald!” she said. “We 

^^had a wonderful climb — 
clear up to the top of the ridge! 
And coming down was almost 
like flying! I’ll tell you all about 
it in a minute, right after I take 
a dip in the p>ool. Ven doesn’t 
like it when I sweat.” She turned 
and ran down to the little p>ool 
in the meadow. 

“See what I mean!” Donald 
gritted. 

“She seems happy. She’s not 
hurt. And Yen’s little weight 
doesn’t seem to bother her. What 
are you complaining about?” 

Donald growled something un- 
intelligible, turned on his heel 
and walked away. 

I let him go. There was no 
sense in making him angrier than 
he was. After a moment the snarl 
of his car’s engine rose to a 
crescendo then faded away into 
the distance. 

A few minutes later Edith 
came back to the ship. “Why did 
Don leave?” she asked. 

“Perhaps he had something to 
do,” Ven said. 

She pouted. “He’s always so 
busy nowadays,” she said sul- 
kily. “He isn’t nice like he used 
to be. Do you think he’s tired of 
me?” 

“No, I don’t think so. He just 
doesn’t like you spending so 
much time up here,” I said. 

“But it’s fun — and Ven likes 
it,” she said. “I like it too. And 



since he isn’t home much any 
more, it’s the only place where I 
can relax and be myself.” She 
brushed the drops of water from 
her body and shook out her damp 
hair. “It’s wonderful up here — 
so quiet and peaceful — and 
Yen’s so nice.” 

My mate’s aura glowed a 
pleased pink as I turned an em- 
barrassed lavender. It was almost 
criminal, I thought, what Ven 
had done to the girl. Donald 
might be my servant, but I had 
never attempted to condition him 
into liking it. As much as possible 
we operated as equals, rather 
than in this sickening relation- 
ship which Ven had imposed 
upon Edith. To avoid showing 
my displeasure I went up to the 
control room, donned my helmet 
and went into rapport with 
Donald. 

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I hadn’t 
realized the true situation. The 
best thing for both of us is for 
Ven and me to leave as quickly 
as possible.” 

“How quick is that?” he shot 
back angrily. 

“Four thousand pounds more,” 
I said. 

‘Whew! That can must drink 
tin.” 

“It takes a great deal to leave 
a planet,” I said. “And hyper- 
space demands a great deal more. 
Once we develop an inertialess 
drive it will be easier. But we’ve 



168 



GALAXY 



only been working on it a thou- 
sand years. These things take 
time.” 

“I imagine. Well, are you going 
to do anything about Edith?” 
“No,” I said. “It would only 
make things worse. The relation- 
ship has gone too far. Ven has 
become an Authority-image.” 
“You could break it.” 

“But I won’t. I’m fond of Ven.” 
“You’re a damned little ty- 
rant,” Donald said. “You like to 
see a human squirm.” 

66 jD E thankful that I’m the 
worst tyrant you’ll see,” I 
answered sharply. “You could 
really learn about them if the 
Slaads knew you existed. They’re 
more advanced than you. And, 
unlike us, they’re warlike and 
predatory. They breed mammals 
for food. However, I’ll put up a 
marker on your moon before I 
leave. They respect Thalassa and 
won’t preempt our claims.” 

“You mean you’re going to 
lay claim to Earth?” 

“Only technically. We’ll exer- 
cise it only if the Governing 
Council decides it will be to our 
advantage.” 

“What would you do if you 
took over?” Don asked curiously. 

“Clean things up,” I said. 
“Stop wars, stabilize the popula- 
tion, increase production and 
distribution, give you an effec- 
tive central government and an 



understandable legal code, and 
eliminate the unfit. In three gen- 
erations you’d be Class VI all 
over your planet.” 

“It sounds good. What’s the 
catch.” 

“The catch,” I said, “is that 
you wouldn’t like it. You mam- 
mals are erratic, emotional and 
uncontrolled. You do not reason 
well, and you have no race dis- 
cipline.” 

“What’s that?” 

“The capability of sacrificing 
units for the benefit of the whole. 
Eugenics control, culling the un- 
fit.” 

“You’re talking about human 
beings!” Donald exploded. 

“And what makes a human 
being different from any other 
animal?” I asked. “Would you 
hesitate to dispose of an animal 
that was unfit to breed?” 

He sighed. “No,” he said. “But 
that’s not the same.” 

“What’s the difference? And 
realize, it’s done for your better- 
ment.” 

“Just a bunch of murderous 
little altruists,” Donald sneered. 
“Out of the kindness of your 
cold-blooded hearts — ” 

“That’s the trouble with you 
lower orders,” I interrupted. 
“You get emotional. Your obser- 
vations have no basis in logic. 
Actually, the Galaxy wouldn’t 
even quiver if the lot of you dis- 
appeared tomorrow. Yet you 



FOUNDING FATHER 



169 



think the universe rotates about 
your heads.” 

“I didn’t—” 

“Don’t interrupt,” I snapped. 
“You — your race — your whole 
pitiful little civilization is ready 
mentally and almost ready tech- 
nologically to commit suicide. If 
we came and saved you, you 
would owe us eternal gratitude, 
but I doubt if we’d get it.” 

“You wouldn’t,” Donald as- 
sured me. “There wouldn’t be 
a human alive who wouldn’t hate 
you.” 

“I realize that — and that is 
one of the reasons I should re- 
port your world imfavorably to 
the council. We could hardly take 
on an altruism mission like this 
unless we felt that our work 
would be appreciated. It would 
be better to let you kill your- 
selves.” 

“Altruism!” 

“In a sense. At least your race 
would be the greater gainers. All 
we’d get would be your excess 
population.” 

“And what would you want 
them for — slaves?” 

“Authority, no!” I said, shocked 
in spite of myself. “We’d merely 
process them for food.” 

He was silent after that. 

r^ONALD was away again, at 
a publisher’s meeting. Our 
new book laid in Restoration 
England was going to be an even 



greater success than the first if 
the advance notices were any 
criterion. Edith was at a studio 
party celebrating the completion 
of the picture in which she was 
working. And Ven was bored. 

For awhile she sat in on 
Donald’s conference in a city 
called New York, but that 
proved to be uninteresting. I was 
busy with a faulty fuel feed in 
the drive chamber. The sun was 
hot, and the day was promising 
to be extremely warm even 
though it was not yet noon. It 
was one of those days when 
nothing happens, and I was 
grateful for it. I had had enough 
of emotional tangles to last me 
for some time. It was almost 
soothing to work with the robots 
on insensate machinery rather 
than supervise a pair of highly 
charged mammals and a hardly 
less unstable mate. 

The association with these en- 
tities hadn’t done Ven a great 
deal of good. In fact, I could 
notice a deterioration of her 
character that bothered me. She 
no longer looked at me with 
respect. Indeed, her yellow eyes 
at times held a pitying amuse- 
ment that I should be so weak as 
to argue with Donald. I didn’t 
bother to point out that the three 
tons of power metal had vir- 
tually all been brought aboard 
through Donald’s efforts, and 
that our conveniences, our de- 



170

fenses, our robots and our very 
lives were diie to the working 
arrangements I had established. 

The only useful thing Edith 
had done in the past month was 
to help me change the tube liners 
in the steering jets. Her size and 
strength had made the job easy 
— and it was normally a hard 
one, since the robots didn’t have 
the flexibility or balance that 
Edith, with her dancer’s body, 
possessed. The job had taken 
two days. It would have taken 
better than a week if I had to 
use robots. 

The mammals, I thought, 
would be of distinct value as 
members of spaceport mainten- 
ance crews. Their combination of 
immense strength and high intel- 
ligence would be useful to our 
society. I made a note of it and 
added it to the data I was as- 
sembling for the Council. It was 
foolish, perhaps, but I couldn’t 
help feeling an interest in these 
creatures. 

I looked across the little valley 
that was our domain. It was an 
idyllic life we were leading. Un- 
hurried — peaceful — the sort of 
life I thoroughly enjoyed. It 
would have been perfect if it 
wasn’t for the insane and danger- 
ous world on which it was being 
lived. 

Of course it was too good to 
last. Idylls invariably are. The 
peace of ours was shattered 



abruptly when Ven came into the 
drive room and disturbed my 
work. Her aura blazed a rich 
violet. 

“Eu,” she said. “Come up to 
the control room. Something’s 
wrong!” 

“What,” I asked. 

“It’s Edith. I can’t do a thing 
with her.” 

“You’re not supposed to. She’s 
working now.” 

“She is not! Her studio has 
finished the picture and they’re 
having a party.” 

“That’s nice. I hope you’re 
letting her have a good time.” 

“I told her to. But I never 
imagined what they’d be doing!” 
Ven’s voice was anguished. 

“Well, what are they doing?” 
“Ingesting ethanol to excess!” 
“Ethanol!” I gasped. “Oh no!” 
I hadn’t realized that normal 
mammals consumed excess 
amounts of the stuff, although 
there were references to it in 
the literature. I thought that was 
merely literary exaggeration. After 
all, we had been here scarcely 
half a year, and we hadn’t really 
learned too much about the de- 
tails of mammalian society. 
Donald’s kidneys had forced him 
to lead a quiet life, and the pass- 
ing of Edith from his control to 
Ven’s had caused no remarkable 
alterations in her doings. 

I should have paid more atten- 
tion to their customs. But I had 



FOUNDING FATHER 



171 




been too busy. I swore as I 
reached for my control helmet. 
I’d have to stop this before it 
became serious. Donald would be 
of no help to me. He was several 
thousand vursts away, and even 
under the best circumstances 
couldn’t be expected back for a 
day. 

I didn’t bother to call him, but 
instead adjusted the controls to 
Edith’s setting. 

VI 

A horde of gaily dressed mam- 
mals surrounded me, their 
faces and bodies oddly fuzzy and 
distorted. Edith’s voice was 
equally fuzzy. There was some- 
thing wrong with her centers. I 
tapped the helmet and checked 
the controller just in case it was 
on our end, but they were func- 
tioning perfectly. There was 
nothing wrong — merely the fact 
that ethanol was disturbing the 
biocircuits I had implanted in her 
brain. I swore a few choice ex- 
pletives of Low Thalassan and 
tried to get through by increasing 
the power. It did no good. 

“I c’n still feel that li’l lizard 
in m’ head,” Edith announced. 
“Gimme another drink. I wanna 
wash her out. Darn li’l lizard 
makes me do things I dowanna 
do. It wants me to quit, but I 
wanna get drunk.” 

“Take it easy,” a fuzzy male 



face said. “You’re loaded. Why 
does a nice chick like you hafta 
be loaded? Whyncha get outa 
here? I gotta nice place over in 
Santa Monica where — ” 

The face disappeared. 

“Hey! Alice! Golly, I almos’ 
din’t reckanize you. Howya 
doin?” 

“Better than you, Edith. 
You’re drunk. And from the 
looks of you, you’re going to be 
sick if you don’t get some fresh 
air.” 

“Gotta go spit in the eye of my 
li’l lizard,” Edith said. “Y’wanna 
come with me? I got Don’s car. 
We c’n get outa here an’ get some 
fresh air — an’ I c’n tell that li’l 
lizard what I think of her.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“You wanna see my li’l lizard. 
She’s got yella eyes, and a li’l 
tail, and she turns all kindsa 
colors, and she lives in a rock 
with a door in it, an she makes 
me do things I dowanna do. It 
ain’t so bad though. Mosta the 
time I like it. Not alia time 
though. That’s why I wanna spit 
in her eye. She c’n tell me all 
she wants — but she’s gotta 
leave me’n Don alone. I love that 
guy.” Edith started sobbing — 
why, I couldn’t understand. 

“She’s maudlin,” I said to Ven. 
“No one’s going to believe a 
thing she is saying. But this 
should be a warning to us. We’ll 
have to put in a block against 



FOUNDING FATHER 



173 




drinking ethanol. I didn’t realize 
how badly it can affect the biocir- 
cuits.” I handed the helmet back 
to Ven. “You can watch this mess 
if you want to. I’m going to our 
quarters.” 

I slipped out of the control 
chair and walked across the room. 

I was stronger now, more ac- 
customed to the gravity, and it 
didn’t bother me unless I had to 
stand for long periods of time. I 
turned in the doorway to look at 
Ven. She had the helmet on again 
and her aura was a crackling red. 
I shook my head. Edith was du'e 
for a bad time when the effects 
of that hydrocarbon wore off. 

I had hardly fallen into light 
estivation when Yen’s projection 
crashed through my antennae. 

“Eu! Get up! Come here 
quickly!” 

With a groan I came slowly 
back to full facility and ran to 
the control room. Yen’s face was 
filled with panic. 

“They’re coming up here,” she 
said. “A whole earful of them!” 

“Who?” 

“Edith’s drunken friends! 
Somehow she’s collected six of 
them and they’re driving up here 
to spit in my eye!” 

Despite myself, I laughed. Ven 
looked so outraged I couldn’t 
help it. 

“We can close the airlock,” I 
said, “and they can’t tell us from 
a rock.” 



“I won’t! I’m going to teach 
that girl a lesson she won’t forget 
in a hurry! I’ve listened to my- 
self being insulted for two hours 
— and she’s still going strong. 
When she gets up here I’ll show 
her whose eye she’ll spit in!” 

l^EN was raging. I’d never seen 
’ her so emotional before. Her 
aura swelled and ebbed in ruddy 
shades as her breath came and 
went in short gasps. 

“And how do you propose to 
do that?” I asked. 

“I’ll stat her!” Ven raged. “I’ll 
stat every one of them!” 

I blinked. “I wouldn’t do that,” 
I said mildly. “What can we do 
with them? The two we have are 
bad enough. And if you stat them, 
we’ll have to kill or condition 
them. We couldn’t let them go 
home with a story like the one 
they’d tell.” 

“I don’t care,” Ven said. “You 
can do what you like about the 
rest of them, but thaf Edith is 
going to learn a lesson.” She was 
being emotional and quite un- 
willing to listen to reason — and 
she was larger and stronger than 
I. Despite my protests, she jerked 
a stat projector from the rack 
and strode toward the open air- 
lock. 

“Thalassa!” she exclaimed. 
“They’re coming through the 
gate! They’ll be here in a minute.” 

I could hear the roar of a pro- 



174 



GALAXY 



testing engine groaning up the 
trail to the lower meadow as I 
hurried aftef Ven. As I reached 
the airlock, the gray body of 
Donald’s station wagon poked its 
nose around the trees below our 
ship. 

Ven stood rigidly in the airlock, 
waiting, her lips tight and her 
eyes narrow. She took a firmer 
grip on the stat as the car stopped 
and the giggling, half-sober 
humans tumbled out. I was in a 
quandary. I didn’t want Ven to 
shoot, but I couldn’t close the 
airlock with her inside it. So I 
stood, hesitating while the group 
of gaily dressed mammals came 
toward us through the trees, their 
high voices loud in the stillness. 

“Gotta find that li’l lizard an 
tell her to stop meddling with my 
life,” Edith’s voice came to my 
ears. 

Ven stiffened beside me as the 
group broke out of the trees in 
front of the ship. 

“Why, Edie, it’s beautiful!” a 
voice said. “It’s a fairy glen! No 
wonder you’d never tell us where 
you got that suntan! And that big 
rock — it’s just like you said — 
•And — uh!” The voice never 
finished as Ven pressed the trig- 
ger. 

I looked down at the six 
crumpled mammalian bodies and 
the lone standing figure that 
looked stupidly up at us. 

“Well,” I said. “You’ve done 



it this time. Now are you satis- 
fied? 

“No,” Ven said. “Not half.” 
Her voice was tight with anger. 
She looked down at Edith. 
“Come here!” she said. 

“Dowanna,” Edith replied un- 
certainly. “You’ve made Don 
leave me. I don’t like you.” -But 
habit was stronger than alcohol 
and under the furious lash of 
Yen’s voice she came unsteadily 
forward. 

“Do you understand me, you 
little sarf!” Ven snapped icily. “I 
said come here!" She took the 
control box from her waist and 
viciously twisted the intensity 
dial to maximum. At this range 
its force was irresistible, even 
with alcohol-deadened synapses. 
Edith shuddered and moved to- , 
ward us, her hands clumsily tear- 
ing at the fabric that covered her. 

“I’m cornin’! You don’ hafta 
shout. I ain’t deaf. I ain’t done 
nothin’!” She sat down beside 
the airlock and struggled out of 
her clothing, ripping the thin 
fabric under the last of Yen’s 
anger until she was completely 
naked. Then she stood up and 
reached her hands toward Ven. 

“You’re not going to try to ride 
her while she’s in that condition?” 

I said. 

“This is my affair,” Ven 
replied grimly. “I’m going to get 
this settled.” 

I shrugged. 



FOUNDING FATHER 



175 



T here was no sense reasoning 
with her while she was in that 
mood. And if she wanted to kill 
herself that was her concern. I 
watched her drop onto Edith’s 
shoulders, wind one hand vi- 
ciously into the mammal’s long 
blonde hair and guide the gross 
body into a shambling walk to- 
ward the meadow. Edith swayed 
dangerously, but somehow she 
managed to stay on her feet as 
they disappeared into the trees. 

I walked over to the six bodies, 
gave each of them a light stat to 
make sure they would remain 
quiet and sat down beside the 
nearest one to think. 

Yen’s anger had left me a size- 
able problem. What on earth 
could I do with six human fe- 
males? I needed them like I 
needed a broken digit. Time 
passed and the sun rose toward 
the zenith, and finally I came to a 
decision. Since we had them on 
our hands, we might as well make 
use of them. Killing would be too 
dangerous. 

And presently Edith came 
through the trees, a sick, tired, 
sober Edith whose face was dirty 
and tear streaked, carrying a 
grim Yen whose aura smoldered a 
reddish brown. 

“What did you do to her?” I 
asked. 

“None of your business,” Yen 
snapped. “She’s all right now. 
Aren’t you, Edith?” 



“Yes, Yen — and I won’t do 
it again. Honest I won’t.” 

“You’d better not,” Yen said 
grimly. “Now I suppose we have 
some work to do.” 

“You certainly have,” I said. 
“If it wasn’t for your temper 
we wouldn’t have this mess on 
our hands. Now get moving! 
Have Edith carry these girls to 
the ship.” I gestured at the prone 
bodies. “And you, get inside and 
bring out the control equipment 
and connect the leads to the com- 
puter.” I was angry, too. Under 
the force of my superior will, 
the two females scurried to obey. 
“I’m disgusted with you. Yen,” 
I said angrily. “Just because your 
pet went to a party, you don’t 
have to act childish. Did you ex- 
pect she’d behave like a Thalas- 
san?” 

“I trusted her,” Yen said. 

“It just goes to show that you 
can’t trust an animal too far,” I 
said. “Now get moving. Bring the 
probes first. We have a lot of 
work to do before evening.” 

I T was finished sooner than I 
expected. The sun was still in 
the sky, but close to the edge of 
the hills. The row of mammalian 
bodies slumbered peacefully be- 
side the airlock. Yen looked 
down at them speculatively. 

“No,” I said. “You have one, 
and that’s enough.” 

“But,” Yen said. 



176 



GALAXY 



“I’ve humored you,” I said. 
“I’ve let you act like a lower 
order. Now I want to see you 
behave like a civilized being. For 
unless you do, I shall have to 
take steps. I’m tired of this child- 
ishness.” 

“I’ll be all right now,” Yen 
replied. “We’ve come to an un- 
derstanding.” She gestured at 
Edith with her primary digit and 
the big mammal shivered. I 
wondered what Yen had done to 
her. Edith was thoroughly 
cowed — actually afraid of little 
Yen, who was less than one fifth 
her size. In a way, I felt an odd 
sort of pride in my mate that 
she should achieve mastery over 
such an intelligent and potentially 
dangerous brute. I knew perfectly 
well that I’d never dare attempt 
such dominance over Donald un- 
less I was prepared to rob him 
of the mentality that made him 
useful. But I consoled myself with 
the thought that this female was 
peculiarly susceptible to domina- 
tion. 

“We’d better get that car out 
of sight,” Yen said. She nodded 
to Edith. The human obediently 
trotted off in the direction of the 
car. A few moments later the 
sound of the motor rose and fell 
as she concealed it in the trees. 

As soon as I could, I con- 
tacted Donald and told him what 
had happened. Fortunately he 
was alone, so his exclamation of 



surprise and consternation didn’t 
arouse any suspicion. 

“Ethanol, eh?” he said specula- 
tively. 

It was easy to follow the trend 
of his thoughts. “Don’t get any 
ideas,” I warned in my best TY 
villain manner. “I have Edith up 
here with me. If you want to see 
her again, you’d better stay 
sober.” 

“I wouldn’t think of crossing 
you,” he assured me insincerely. 
“I’m too close to being rid of 
you.” 

“Well — what do we do?” I 
asked. “You’re the expert on this 
insane society of yours.” 

“You’ve done it,” he said. “I 
don’t think it was smart of you, 
but under the circumstances, I 
can’t see how you could have 
done anything else. I warned you 
about Yen and Edith,” he added 
— rather gloatingly, I thought. 
“Now you’re in for it.” His voice 
was almost gay. 

“How?” 

“Six women vanishing all at 
once is going to cause a stir even 
in Los Angeles,” he said. 

“After an ethanol party?” I 
asked curiously. “Six dancers out 
of a production that used a hun- 
dred? Your city will never miss 
them.” 

“But their families will.” 

Families! I hadn’t thought of 
that. Mammals had strong family 
ties — probably due to their 



FOUNDING FATHER 



177 



method of reproduction. We 
Thalassans, coming as we did 
from eggs, had none of this. The 
state inculiators and the creches 
were our only contact with 
parenthood. We had no families. 
“Hmm,” I said. “I hadn’t thought 
of that.” 

“Well, you’d better start. I 
hope it gives you a headache.” 

“You get nastier every time I 
talk with you,” I complained. 

“I have my reasons,” he said 
bitterly. “Now, if you’re through 
with me, little master, I think I’d 
like to get some sleep. In the 
meantime you’d better get them 
back to their homes before they’re 
missed.” 

“I can’t,” I confessed. “The 
controller isn’t big enough to 
handle eight of you — not as 
individuals.” 

Donald chuckled grimly. 
“That’s your worry. Remember, 
unless you find out which of 
them will be missed and act ac- 
cordingly, you’re going to be very 
much in the public eye.” 

I didn’t feel too happy as I cut 
off, but Donald had given me 
an idea. 

One by one I checked the new 
proxies. Of the six, two were 
living together. They had the 
casual emotional involvement 
with males so characteristic of 
this species, but they could re- 
main here for several days with- 



out causing comment. Of the re- 
remaining four, one had a room- 
mate and would be difficult to 
extract; another was living alone; 
still another was mated and had 
an offspring, but she was not 
living with her mate — a legal 
action having separated her much 
as it separates incompatible 
Thalassans. The offspring, how- 
ever, was living with her when 
she wasn’t working, a not un- 
usual situation on this world, but 
one which could have some com- 
plications unless she was returned 
to it very shortly. 

The last was living with her 
parents and was seriously in- 
volved emotionally with a male. 
She was planning to be officially 
mated in the near future, al- 
though it would be legal fiction 
rather than fact since she was 
already nurturing a living embryo 
of some three weeks develop- 
ment. I debated whether to re- 
move it, a simple enough manipu- 
lation, but decided against it. It 
would be interesting to observe a 
mammalian reproduction. But to 
remove her from her family and 
her unofficial mate was a task 
that might be difficult. I needed 
help. 

I projected a call for Ven, 
phrasing it imperatively so she 
could have no doubt about its 
urgency. Her answer was quick 
and clear. 

“I’m coming,” she said. 



178 



GALAXY 



“Good. I need you. And bring 
Edith. We have a problem that 
will require her talents.” 

“She’ll be happy to cooperate.” 
Ven’s projection was cheerfully 
confident. 

“You did her no permanent 
damage, I hope.” 

“Not a bit. In fact, you’d never 
know she’s been disciplined.” 

“Well, get in here, both of you. 
We have work to do.” 

Edith had trouble squeezing 
into the control room and, despite 
her skin conditioning, the place 
quickly filled with her scent. But 
Ven and I were old hands now 
and took it in stride. She grasped 
the problem instantly. “The only 
one who might be any trouble is 
Alice. Her family and her boy 
friend can be difficult. The others 
won’t need much effort, except 
for Grace. She’d better be re- 
turned to her baby as soon as 
possible.” 

“How soon?” I asked. 

“The baby isn’t living with 
her,” Edith added, “not while 
she’s working, but she sees it 
regularly. Every day or two, T 
believe.” 

I sighed. That solved the big- 
gest problem. 

“We had better start at once,” 
Ven said. 

T ignored her and looked inquir- 
ingly at Edith. “What would 
you do?” I asked, flashing a cold 



projection at Ven to stay out of 
this. 

“Well — if I had to do it, I’d 
send Alice and Grace home. I 
wouldn’t do anything to Alice ex- 
cept block her from talking about 
this place and what happened. 
Grace I’d put under full control, 
have her pick up her baby, go 
home and pack to leave. As soon 
as .,she’s ready to go, bring her 
out here.” 

“The infant, too?” 

“Of course. A baby’s no 
bother.” 

This, I thought, was something 
of an understatement. 

“And what of the others?” I 
asked. • 

“Velma has a nosey room- 
mate. Have her start a fight and 
leave angry. She hasn’t much 
baggage, and it won’t be any 
trouble for her to collect it. As 
for the other three, I think Joan’s 
being kept. She can’t afford a 
single apartment on her salary. 
Loleta and Marian are always 
out, sometimes for days. Their 
landlady won’t think a thing of 
it. If they never return, she’ll just 
pack their things and rent the 
room to someone else. I know 
that old witch. I’d just keep those 
three here and not worry about 
them. Nobody’s going to make 
any fuss about three chorines dis- 
appearing. Later on you can 
make them write letters enclosing 
money to send their clothes to 



FOUNDING FATHER 



179

another city. Then they can be 
picked up and stored. That 
should give us a year before 
anyone gets suspicious enough to 
look for them.” 

“Edith,” I said, “you’re a 
genius.” 

“I got you into this mess,” 
Edith said. “So, perhaps I’d bet- 
ter get you out.” 

“But your fellow mamrhals — ” 

“You haven’t hurt me — not 
much, anyway,” Edith said. “So 
I don’t suppose you’ll hurt them. 
And, besides, I don’t want Ven 
mad at me like she was this 
afternoon. Anyway — you’ll be 
gone soon.” 

“I think I shall regret leaving,” 
I said honestly. “There is a great 
deal about you mammals I am 
beginning to suspect I do not 
know.” 

“You aren’t kidding,” she said 
with faint bitterness so similar to 
Donald’s that my antennae 
quivered. “But it’s been quite an 
experience. I’ll tell my kids when 
I have them — but they’re not 
going to believe me.” 

“I hope you have those chil- 
dren — and raise them to 
maturity,” I said. 

The tone of my voice caused 
her to look at me with sudden 
fear on her face. But at the 
sight of my impassive features it 
died away. “You scared me for a 
moment,” she said. 

“Did I? I didn’t mean to.” 



t^HE next week kept us busy 
following Edith’s instructions. 
I didn’t see how they would 
apply to Alice, but Edith knew 
her species better than I. Alice’s 
silence and the prying inquisitive- 
ness of her parents and her boy- 
friend worked like magic. Alice 
finally became angry and after a 
stormy scene left the house, 
swearing never to return. Edith 
picked her up as she walked 
away; Ven turned on the control 
and turned the threat to fact. 
Later I took a leaf from Edith’s 
book and sent Alice to San Fran- 
cisco, where I had her write a 
pair of bitter letters to her parents 
and her extralegal mate. After 
that I felt more secure. 

The others worked out exactly 
as Edith predicted. No trouble at 
all. By the time Donald returned 
from the East with a ton of tin 
ingots in a small truck our train- 
ing schedule was well set up. The 
robots and I had managed to 
build a multiplex controller 
similar to those we used on 
Thalassa on the state farms, but 
much smaller. It could handle the 
proxies en masse or as individuals. 
While far less sensitive than the 
one in the ship, it was effective 
enough for our rather elementary 
purposes. 

Edith, who was running the 
group under Ven’s supervision. 



180 



GALAXY 



had them lined up in a row to 
greet Donald as he came up the 
hill toward the ship. 

“The place looks like a nudist 
colony,” Donald grumbled. “You 
haven’t improved it any.” He 
eyed the file of mammals troop- 
ing down to the truck to unload 
the tin ingots. “I have another 
ton lined up for delivery as soon 
as you get this processed,” he 
said. 

“Good,” I replied. “We’ll leave 
as soon as it’s aboard. I don’t 
like the looks of your recent ac- 
tions.” 

“Mine?” I shook my head. 
“Oh, you mean the world situa- 
tion.” I nodded. “You shouldn’t 
worry about it. You should have 
seen it this time last year.” 

I shrugged. I would never 
really understand these creatures. 
Their brains functioned differ- 
ently. “You frighten me with 
your wild displays of emotion. 
Someday one of you is going to 
start something and your world 
is going to go up in fire.” 

“I don’t think so,” he said. “I 
have some ideas about that. With 
the money from your stories and 
with what you have taught me, 
I think there will be some 
changes.” There was a peculiar 
expression in his eyes that I 
couldn’t identify. It made me 
vaguely uneasy. “I’ve been doing 
a lot of thinking since you met 
up with Edie and me. What this 



world needs is someone who can 
run it.” 

“That’s obvious,” I said. “Until 
your society catches up with 
your technology you will be in 
constant danger. You mammals 
will have to learn to discipline 
your emotions.” 

His face twisted. “I’ve had a 
good practical course in that,” he 
said. “Now I’m getting post- 
graduate training.” He gestured 
at the women coming up the hill 
carrying the silver tin ingots. 
“Just how long do you think I 
can endure something like this?” 
“Like what?” I asked. 

“Do I have to draw you a 
diagram?” he asked. “Ever since 
you lizards came into my life I 
haven’t been able to touch a 
woman. Not even Edith — and 
she’s my wife. Just how much 
of this do you think I can take?” 

I exclaimed with 
'^dawning comprehension. “I 
think I see.” 

The situation would have been 
amusing if it wasn’t so stupid. I 
was surprised that I hadn’t real- 
ized it before. There was, I knew, 
a certain amount of feedback in 
a bipolar control circuit. Obvi- 
ously enough of Ven’s condition- 
ing, and mine, had seeped through 
to affect Donald and Edith’s nor- 
mal relationships. Manimals were

zines, television and motion pic- 
tures reeked of it. It was present 
in almost every piece of advertis- 
ing, and four of our six new 
proxies were living histories of it. 
Yet Donald and Edith, because of 
our feedback, had been kept as 
continent as novitiates for the 
priesthood of Authority! 

“I’m a perfectly normal male,” 
Donald said. “Just what do you 
think you’ve been doing to me? 
I can’t drink. I can’t make love. 
I can’t do anything except collect 
tin for you lizards. Just why do 
you think I hate you? Now you 
surround me with a whole 
damned untouchable harern! Are 
you trying to drive me insane?” 

I laughed, and Donald recog- 
nize the sound for what it was. 

“Oh, damn you!” he said bit- 
terly. “How would you like to 
be married for eight months and 
for six of them be unable to 
touch your wife? Just why do you 
think Edith tried to get drunk? I 
could kill you cheerfully for what 
you’ve done to us!” 

“Oh!” I said. There was a 
world of understanding opening 
in front of me. Of course, it 
would do no good to tell him 
that Ven and I had remained in 
enforced continence for five 
years. It was just the Eugenics 
council working through us — 
entirely involuntarily. What was 
bothering Donald and Edith was 
so absurdly simple that neither 



Ven nor I would have thought to 
ask. And the mammals with their 
peculiar customs and habits 
would never have told us unless 
— as had happened — the pres- 
sure became too great. 

What our mammals needed 
was a good dose of Va Krul’s 
basic therapy. If Edith were 
fertilized as a result of it, so 
much the better. It would keep 
her attention where it more prop- 
erly belonged. The thought 
would never have occurred to 
me in my present state. Since I 
was content, I had erroneously 
assumed that everything was in 
harmony. 

“You might as well go home,” 
I said. “Take Edith with you. 
We won’t need you for several 
days.” 

“Why?” 

“You’ll find things a little dif- 
ferent. I’ll make a few adjust- 
ments on the controller.” 

my surprise Don didn’t ap- 
pear happy at all. “Does that 
mean what I think it does?” he 
demanded. “Do you think I’ll get 
any satisfaction out of being con- 
trolled even there?’’' 

“I don’t know about the 
pleasure,” I. said coldly, “but I 
do know that it will improve your 
attitude.” 

Donald raged at me, his brain 
white with anger. “So help me 
God, Eu Kor, someday I’m going 



182 



GALAXY 



to kill you for this! It’s the ulti- 
mate insult.” 

“You’re not going to do any- 
thing,” I said calmly. His voice 
dissolved into obscenity. For a 
moment I felt sorry for him until 
I remembered the basic truth 
that none of us are free — and 
the most intelligent, naturally, are 
the least free of all. They are 
bound by their commitments, 
their duties, their responsibili- 
ties, and by their intelligence it- 
self. If a superior intelligence oc- 
casionally exhibits petty lapses 
— which amuse him or relieve 
his boredom — it is not the place 
of the less endowed to construe 
it as a sign of equality. 

Some — like Ven and me — 
have known their place from 
birth. Others, like Edith and 
Alice, learn easily with a mini- 
mum amount of pain. Some like 
Grace learn hard; and some — 
like Donald — do not learn at 
all. 

Donald was the eternal rebel, 
complying because he must, yet 
seething with resentment because 
he did. He was the personifica- 
tion of drive without innate con- 
trol, ambition without humility, 
intelligence without wisdom. As 
he had been, he was not quite 
enqugh. At best he would have 
been a minor author and a petty 
domestic tyrant. He would never 
have been a threat simply be- 
cause he didn’t have the ability 



or training. But I had given him 
what he lacked. The knowledge 
I had impressed upon his mind 
would give him a tremendous 
advantage over his fellow mam- 
mals, and his tendencies toward 
domestic tyranny would expand 
to include others. His glandular 
attitude would pervert his knowl- 
edge to the detriment of human- 
kind. He could become a thing 
so dangerous that it could destroy 
this precariously balanced world. 

T went into the ship and set up 

a world matrix on the com- 
puter, using all the data I had 
accumulated, secured the an- 
swer, and then inserted Donald’s 
potential into the matrix. I then 
ordered a probability extrapola- 
tion for both matrices, equating 
the solutions with survival. 

The answers confirmed my 
thoughts. With the matrix as it 
stood, the twenty year survival 
prediction was 65 per cent, which 
wasn’t too bad since few ad- 
vanced-technology worlds have 
better than an 85 per cent sur- 
vival probability. But with 
Donald in the matrix, the sur- 
vival prediction was zero! 

I knew what I must do. I could 
not leave him behind as I had 
planned. Nor could I inflict the 
senseless cruelty of brainblotting. 
He would have to be mercifully 
destroyed. 

Although I was fond of Donald, 



FOUNDING FATHER 



183 



and his death would leave me 
sick for weeks, it would not be 
right to let my creation live and 
condemn the mammal race to 
death. I could not exterminate a 
race Authority had created. The 
guilt syndrome would be shatter- 
ing. Of course, if they killed each 
qther that was not my concern. 

But until we left I would give 
him all the freedom he could use. 
Outside of the minimum of con- 
trol, he would be free to do and 
act as he pleased. I didn’t owe 
it to him, yet it was not his fault 
that he had come into my hands. 
And when I returned to Thalassa 
I would tell the Council what I 
had done and ask for justice. Per- 
haps we could save this world 
from itself even as we had saved 
others. The question of gratitude 
would be immaterial. 

With a firm hand to set them 
on the track, the mammals might 
learn the values of intelligence 
and cooperation before it was too 
late. They might understand the 
realities of existence rather than 
fall victim to their glandular fan- 
cies. They might. But if they did, 
one thing would be certain — 
they would learn it the hard way. 
Donald was proof of that. 

I went to our living quarters, 
and presently Ven joined me. 
“They’re all in for the night, Eu,” 
she said. 

“That’s good. How are they 
coming along?” 



“Splendidly. Another week 
should see the end of the train- 
ing. Edith was a good experience 
for rtie in handling these. I’m not 
making the mistakes I did. I’m 
finding the blocks and removing 
them. One of them, the one called 
Grace, should be even better than 
Edith.” 

“As a mount?” I asked with 
faint humor. “Or as a working 
proxy?” 

“Both,” Ven said promptly. 
“She’s stronger and more intelli- 
gent. Yet even so I think I shall 
always like Edith best.” 

66/^NE’S first dependent is al- 
'^ways one’s fondest memo- 
ry,” I replied sententiously, 
“But you’ll forget them all when 
we’re back on Thalassa.” 

“I won’t,” Ven said. “I’ll never 
forget Edith.” 

“Never is a long time,” I said 
gently. “I shall even forget the 
pain of killing Donald some day.” 
“Then you’ve decided to elimi- 
nate him?” Ven said. 

I nodded. “It’s necessary,” I 
said. “This world wouldn’t be 
safe with him alive.” 

“Poor Edith. She’s fond of the 
brute,” Ven said. She moved to- 
ward the doorway. 

“Where are you going?” I 
asked. 

“I want to talk to Edith. Per- 
haps I can prepare her.” 

“No. Don’t,” I said. “Contact 



184 



GALAXY 



her if you wish, but tell her 
nothing.” 

“Very well,” she said. I 
smiled as she disappeared. Ven 
was going to miss her pet once we 
had left. It was obvious. 

“Eu! Quick!” Ven’s projection 
crackled in my brain. “They’re 
fighting! Edith’s being hurt, and 
I can’t touch them! They’ve set 
up a block!” 

I ran for the control room, 
slapped the helmet on my head, 
reached for the controls — and 
stopped, laughing. 

“Stop them!” Ven screamed. 
Her aura blazed a brilliant white 
and her projection nearly 
knocked me down. She reached 
for the control switch, but I 
slapped her hand away. 

“Quiet!” I snapped. “They’re 
not fighting, you little fool! Turn 
on your audio and listen and stop 
acting silly!” 

Ven did as^ I told her and her 
aura changed to a fiery pink. 
“Oh!” she said in a small voice, 
“but they never — ” 

I must have made some mis- 
take in revising the controllers — 
or feedback was stronger than I 
suspected — for the Va Krul syn- 
drome came back along our 
lines of contact with explosive 
force! Desperately I reached for 
the switch — but my hand froze 
in midair as an intolerable wave 
of emotion drove Ven and me 
together like two pieces of iron 

F O U N D I N T A T H E R 



with opposite magnetic charge! 
The last thing I remember was 
being enveloped in the flaring 
golden glow of Ven’s aura. 

T came to my senses in our living 
quarters. I was stunned — ex- 
hausted — limp and gasping. 

“Thalassa!” I said weakly, 
“we’ve really done it now!” 

Ven smiled a pale blue radiance 
at me. “You have become strong, 
living on this heavy world,” she 
said. “I like it.” 

“But — but!” I sputtered. 
“It was so — it can’t — it 
couldn’t — ” 

“But it did,” Ven said softly. 
“And I’m glad it did.” 

“I don’t mean that. What I 
mean to say was that it was 
so — ” 

“Unexpected?” 

“No! So utterly—” 
“Satisfying?” she asked. 

“Stop interrupting! It was all 
of that and more. But what I 
want to say is that we’ve violated 
the prime restriction for space 
travellers. How could we do it?” 
“You’re forgetting that for 
some time we have been liv- 
ing upon this emotion-charged 
world,” Ven said. “The steady 
erosion was more than our con- 
ditioning could take. The feed- 
back was merely the last in a 
whole series of disruptive stimuli. 
It was the trigger, but our de- 
fenses had been weakened long 



185 



before. Not that I’m sorry,” she 
added quickly. “For weeks I’ve 
been wondering what sort of a 
mate you’d be when this trip was 
over. I’m not unhappy with the 
preview.” She smiled at me and 
the whole of our living quarters 
was filled with a bright tender 
blue. 

“The natives,” I said worriedly. 
“We were in contact with them.” 

Ven’s aura darkened. “I had 
forgotten them,” she said. “I hope 
that the feedback wasn’t intensi- 
fied and returned to them. I’d 
better look.” She started for the 
control room and I followed more 
slowly. 

“There’s no damage,” she said 
from beneath the helmet. “Edith 
feels just as I do.” 

I took my helmet and coded 
Don’s pattern on the selector. 
Peculiar, I thought with vague 
wonder. Most peculiar. For the 
first time Donald and I were in 
true rapport. His mind was slow, 
lazy, sluggish — even his ambi- 
tion was sated for the moment. 
Could it be, I wondered, that we 
could find agreement through our 
emotions? Was it frustration that 
drove him? Whatever the block 
had been it was gone now. This 
was a true empathic meeting — 
something far more satisfying 
than our previous conflict. 

I relaxed in it, feeling the slow 
langorous questings of his mind 
even as he felt mine. There was 



a sense of brotherhood that 
transcended differences in race 
and culture. We were down to 
basics, on the oldest meeting 
ground of life. 

He was wondering idly what 
the outcome of this might be — 
conscious of me, but careless. It 
jolted me. He might be uncertain, 
but I knew Ven was from good 
family stock, and “good” to a 
Thalassan meant something en- 
tirely different than it commonly 
did to the natives of this planet! 

I disengaged hurriedly and 
shook Ven out of her rapport 
with Edith. “We’ve no time to 
lose,” I said. “We must leave at 
once! You know what’s going to 
happen!” 

“I know,” Ven said. “I feel 
the changes already.” 

“That’s just in your mind,” I 
snapped. 

“We’re not going home,” she 
said. There was a note of prophe- 
cy in her voice. “We’ll never 
make it.” 

“We can’t stay here!” 

“I know.” 

“Then what are we going to 
do?” 

V|^E couldn’t stay here. But we 
couldn’t go home either. The 
trip would take weeks, and hy- 
perspace is fatal to a gravid 
Thalassan female. That was 
something we learned long ago, 
and the principal reason for con- 



186 



GALAXY 



tinence-conditioning for couples 
in space. What was more, I knew 
that where Ven stayed, I would 
stay. 

“Remember the fourth planet 
of this system?” Ven asked. 

“Yes. Ideal gravity, adequate 
oxygen, but too cold.” 

“And with no intelligent life,” 
Ven added. “That’s an advantage 
— and we can beat the cold. It 
wouldn’t be too hard to build 
domes. We have plenty of power 
metal, and a matricizer. We could 
hatch our clutch there. With the 
mammals to help us, we should 
be able to make a comfortable 
enough life for the forty years 
it’ll take to bring our offspring to 
maturity. We should be able to 
do this easily, and still get home 
before we’re strangers.” 

**Hmm,” I said. “It’s possible. 
And we can use this world for a 
supply base. But would you care 
to live on that cold barren 
planet?” 

“There are worse places,” she 
said matter-of-factly. “And we’d 
be close to everything we’d need.” 

It did have possibilities. And 
the mammals could be adapted. 
They were a more advanced evo- 
lutionary form than we, but 
lower on the adaptive scale — 
nonspecialized — more so than 
any other intelligent race I had 
encountered. 

Ven said, “We would actually 
be doing their race a favor, if the 



computation of this world’s fu- 
ture is correct Some of them 
would still survive if this planet 
commits suicide. And if the pre- 
diction is wrong, we would have 
done no harm. If they reach 
space, they’ll merely find that 
they’ve already arrived when 
they reach the fourth planet.” 

“Which might be something of 
a surprise to their explorers,” I 
said with a chuckle. “All right. 
We’ll play it your way.” 

I was pretty sure how Donald 
would take this. He was going to 
be ftirious, but after all one 
doesn’t make a pet of a wolf and 
then turn it loose. It’s too hard 
on the livestock. But I didn’t 
think he’d be too unhappy. He’d 
be the principal human on Mars; 
and after we left he’d be ruler 
of a world. And in the meantime 
he could be a domestic tyrant. 

It was fortunate, I thought with 
a smile, that mammals were 
essentially polygamous. Donald 
would make some nasty com- 
ments about being a herd sire — 
but I didn’t think his comments 
would be too sincere. After all, 
it’s not every man that has a 
chance to become a founding 
father. 

I was still smiling as I turned 
the dials on the controller and 
flipped the switch. Founding 
father — the title was as much 
mine as his!

FOUNDING FATHER

The first Laika visited space and died. The second Laika 
reversed that order — to save a man's life! 



MOON 

DOG 

By ARTHUR C. CLARKE IHustrofed by DICK FRANCIS 



W HEN I heard Laika’s 
frantic barking, my first 
reaction was one of an- 
noyance. I turned over in my 
bunk and murmured sleepily 
“Shut up, you silly bitch.” That 
dreamy interlude lasted only a 
fraction of a second. Then con- 
sciousness returned — and with 
it, fear. Fear of loneliness, and 
fear of madness. 

For a moment I dared not oj)en 
my eyes. I was afraid of what I 
might see. Reason told me that no 
dog had ever set foot up>on this 
world, that Laika was separated 
from me by a quarter of a million 
miles of space — and, far more 
irrevocably, by five years of time. 
“You’ve been dreaming,” I told 



myself angrily. “Stop being a fool 
— open your eyes! You won’t see 
anything except the glow of the 
wall-paint.” 

That was right, of course. The 
tiny cabin was empty, the door 
tightly closed. I was alone with 
my memories, overwhelmed by 
the transcendental sadness that 
often comes when some bright 
dream fades into drab reality. 
The sense of loss was so desolat- 
ing that I longed to return to 
sleep. 

It was well that I failed to do 
so, for at that moment sleep 
would have been death. But I did 
not know this for another five sec- 
onds, and during that eternity I 
was back on Earth, seeking what 



188 



GALAXY 



comfort I could from the unfor- 
gotten past. 

1^0 one ever discovered Laika’s 
origin, though the Observa- 
tory staff made a few inquiries 
and I inserted several advertise- 
ments in the Pasadena news- 
papers. I found her, a lost and 
lonely ball of fluff, huddled by the 
roadside one summer evening 
when I was driving up to Palomar. 
Though I have never liked dogs, 
or indeed any animals, it was im- 
possible to leave this helpless 
little creature to the mercy of the 
passing cars. With some qualms, 
wishing that I had - a pair of 
gloves, I picked her up and 
dumped her in the baggage com- 
partment. I was not going to haz- 
ard the upholstery of my new ’92 
Vik, and felt that she could do 
little damage there. In this, I was 
not altogether correct. 

When I had parked the car at 
the Monastery — the astrono- 
mers’ residential quarters, where 
I’d be living for the next week — 
I inspected my find without much 
enthusiasm. I had intended to 
hand the puppy over to the jani- 
tor. But then it whimpered and 
op>ened its eyes. There was such 
an expression of helpless trust in 
them that — well, I kept it. 

Sometimes I regretted that de- 
cision. But never for long. 

I had no idea how much trouble 
a growing dog could cause, de- 



liberately and otherwise. My 
cleaning and repair bills soared. 

I could never be sure of finding 
an unravaged pair of socks or an 
unchewed copy of the Astrophyai- 
cal Journal. But eventually Laika 
was both house-trained and Ob- 
servatory-trained; she must have 
been the only dog ever to be al- 
lowed inside the 200-inch dome. 
She would lie there quietly in the 
shadows for hours, while I was up 
in the cage making adjustments, 
quite content if she could hear my 
voice from time to time. The 
other astronomers became equal- 
ly fond of her (it was old Dr. 
Anderson who suggested her 
name) but from the beginning she 
was my dog. She would obey no 
one else. Not that she would al- 
ways obey me. 

She was a beautiful animal, 
about 95% Alsatian. It was that 
missing 5%, I imagine, that led to 
her being abandoned. (I still feel 
a surge of anger when I think of 
it, but as I shall never know the 
facts I may be jumping to false 
conclusions.) Apart from two 
dark patches over the eyes, most 
of her body was a smoky gray. 
Her coat was soft as silk. When 
her ears were pricked up, she 
looked incredibly intelligent and 
alert. Sometimes I would be dis- 
cussing spectral types or stellar 
evolution with my colleagues, and 
it would be hard to believe that 
she was not understanding us. 



MOONDOG

Even now, I cannot understand 
why she bdcame so attached to 
me, for I have made very few 
friends among human beings. Yet 
when I returned to the Observa- 
tory after an absence, she would 
go almost frantic with delight, 
boimcing round on her hindlegs 
and putting her paws on my 
shoulders — which she could 
reach quite easily — all the while 
uttering small squeaks of joy 
which seemed highly inappropri- 
ate from so large a dog. I hated 
to leave her for more than a few 
days at a time. I could not take 
her with me on overseas trips, but 
she accompanied me on most of 
my shorter journeys. 

She was with me when I drove 
north to attend that ill-fated sem- 
inar at Berkeley. 

^HE had been very good com- 
^ pany on the long drive. 

We were staying with univer- 
sity acquaintances on Telegraph 
Hill; they had been polite about 
it, but obviously did not look for- 
ward to having a monster in the 
house. However, I assured them 
that Laika never gave the slight- 
est trouble. Rather reluctantly, 
they let her sleep in the living 
room. “You needn’t worry about 
burglars tonight,” I said. 

“We don’t have any in Berke- 
ley,” they answered, rather coldly. 

In the middle of the night it 
seemed that they were wrong. 



I was awakened by an hysteri- 
cal, high-pitched barking from 
Laika which I had heard only 
once before — when she had first 
seen a cow, and did not know 
what on earth to make of it. Curs- 
ing, I threw off the sheets and 
stumbled out into the darkness of 
the unfamiliar house. My main 
thought was to silence Laika be- 
fore she roused my hosts — as- 
suming that this was not already 
far too late. If there had been an 
intruder, he would certainly have 
taken flight by now. Indeed, I 
rather hoped that he had. 

For a moment I stood beside 
the switch at the top of the stairs, 
wondering whether to throw it. 
Then I growled, “Shut up, Laika!” 
and irritably flooded the place 
with light. 

She was scratching frantically 
at the door, pausing from time to 
time to give that hysterical yelp. 
“If you want out,” I said angrily, 
“there’s no need for all that fuss.” 
I went down and shot the bolt. 
She took off into the night like a 
rocket. 

It was very calm and still, with 
a waning moon struggling to 
pierce the San Francisco fog. I 
stood in the luminous haze, look- 
ing out across the water to the 
lights of the city, waiting for 
Laika to come back so that I 
could chastise her suitably. I was 
still waiting when, for the secpnd 
time in the Twentieth Century, 



190 



GALAXY 




the San Andreas Fault woke from 
its sleep. 

Oddly enough, I was not fright- 
ened — at first. 

I can remember that two 
thoughts passed through my 
mind, in the moment before I 
realized the danger. Surely, I told 
myself, the geophysicists could 
have given us some warning. And 
then I found myself thinking, 
with great surprise, “I’d no idea 
that earthquakes make so much 
noisel” 

It was about then that I knew 
that this was no ordinary quake. 

What happened afterward I 
would prefer to forget. The Red 
Cross did not take me off until 
quite late the next morning, be- 
cause I refused to leave Laika. 
As I looked at the shattered 
house containing the bodies of my 
friends, I knew that I owed my 
life to her; but the helicopter 
pilots could not be expected to 
imderstand that, and I cannot 
blame them for thinking that I 
was crazy, like so many of the 
others they had foimd wandering 
among the fires and the debris. 

A FTER that, I do not suppose 
we were ever apart for more 
than a few hours. I have been 
told — and I can well believe it 
— that I became less and less in- 
terested in human company, with- 
out being actively unsocial or mis- 
anthropic. Between them, the 



stars and Laika filled all my 
needs. We used to go for long 
walks together over the moun- 
tains; it was the happiest time I 
have ever known. 

There was only one flaw. I 
knew, though Laika could not, 
how soon it must end. 

We had been planning the 
move for more than a decade. As 
far back as the 1960’s, it was real- 
ized that Earth was no place for 
an astronomical observatory. 
Even the small pilot instruments 
on the Moon had far out-per- 
formed all the telescopes peering 
through the murk and haze of the 
terrestrial atmosphere. The story 
of Mount Wilson, Palomar, 
Greenwich and the other great 
names was coming to an end. 
They would still be used for train- 
ing purposes, but the research 
frontier must move out into space. 

I had to move with it. Indeed, 
I had already been offered the 
post of Deputy Director, Farside 
Observatory. In a few months, I 
could hope to solve problems I 
had been working on for years. 
Beyond the atmosphere, I would 
be like a blind man who had sud- 
denly been given sight. 

It was utterly impossible, of 
course, to take Laika with me. 
The only animals on the Moon 
were those needed for experi- 
mental purposes. It might be an- 
other generation before pets were 
allowed, and even then it would 



192 



GALAXY 



cost a fortune to carry them there 
and to keep them alive. Providing 
Laika with her usual two pounds 
of meat a day would take several 
times my quite comfortable sal- 
ary. 

The choice was simple and 
straightforward. I could stay on 
Earth and abandon my career. Or 
^ I could go to the Moon and aban- 
don Laika. 

After all, she was only a dog. 

In a dozen years, she would be 
dead, while I should be reaching 
the peak of my profession. No 
sane man would have hesitated 
over the matter. Yet I did hesi- 
tate, and if by now you do not 
imderstand why, no further words 
of mine can help. 

In the end, I let matters go by 
default. Up to the very week I 
was due to leave, I had still made 
no plans for Laika. When Dr. 
Anderson volunteered to look 
after her, I accepted numbly, 
with scarcely a word of thanks. 
The old physicist and his wife 
had always been fond of her, and 
I am afraid that they considered 
me indifferent and heartless. The 
truth was just the opposite. 

We went for one more walk 
together over the hills; then I 
delivered her silently to the An- 
dersons, and did not see her again. 

^AKE-OFF was delayed almost 
twenty-four hours until a 
major flare-storm had cleared the 



Earth’s orbit. Even so, the Van 
Allen belts were still so active 
that we had to make our exit 
through the North Polar Gap. 

It was a miserable flight. Apart 
from the usual trouble with 
weightlessness, we were all groggy 
with anti-radiation drugs. The 
ship was already over Farside be- 
fore I took much interest in the 
proceedings, so I missed the sight 
of Earth dropping below the hori- 
zon. Nor was I really sorry. I 
wanted no reminders, and in- 
tended to think only of the future. 
Yet I could not shake off that 
feeling of guilt; I had deserted 
someone who loved and trusted 
me, and was no better than those 
who had abandoned Laika when 
she was a puppy, beside the dusty 
road to Palomar. 

The news that she was dead 
reached me a month later. 

There was no reason that any- 
one knew; the Andersons had 
done their best, and were very 
upset. She had just lost interest in 
living, it seemed. For a while, I 
think I did the same; but work is 
a wonderful anodsme, and my 
program was just getting under 
way. 

Though I never forgot Laika, in 
a little while the memory ceased 
to hurt. 

Then why had it come back to 
haunt me, five years later, on the 
far side of the Moon? I was 
searching my mind for the reason.

when the metal building around 
me quivered as if under the im- 
pact of a heavy blow. 

I reacted without thinking. I 
was already closing the helmet of 
my emergency suit when the 
foundations slipped and the wall 
tore open with a short-lived 
scream of escaping air. Because 
I had automatically pressed the 
General Alarm button we lost 
only two men, despite the fact 
that the tremor — the worst ever 
recorded on Farside — cracked all 
three of the Observatory’s pres- 
sure-domes. 

It is hardly necessary for me to 
say that I do not believe in the 
supernatural. Everything that 
happened has a perfectly rational 
explanation, obvious to any man 
with the slightest knowledge of 
psychology. In the Second San 
Francisco earthquake, Laika was 
not the only dog to sense ap- 
proaching disaster. Many such 
cases were reported. And on Far- 
side, my own memories must have 
given me that heightened aware- 



ness, when my never-sleeping sub- 
conscious detected the first faint 
vibrations from within the Moon. 

The human mind has strange 
and labyrinthine ways of going 
about its business. It knew the 
signal that would most swiftly 
rouse me to the knowledge of 
danger. There is nothing more to 
it than that; though in a sense one 
could say that Laika woke me on 
both occasions, there is no mys- 
tery about it, no miraculous 
warning across the gulf that 
neither man nor dog can ever 
bridge. 

Of that I am sure, if I am sure 
of anything. 

Yet sometimes I wake now, in 
the silence of the Moon, and wish 
that the dream could have lasted 
a few seconds longer — so that I 
could have looked just once more 
into those luminous brown eyes, 
brimming with an unselfish, unde- 
manding love I have found no- 
where else on this world, or on 
any other.
