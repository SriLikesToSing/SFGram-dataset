Do You Laugh 
Your Greatest 
Powers Away? 

THOSE STRANGE 
INNER URGES 

You have heard the phrase, 
"Laugh, clown, laugh.” Well, that 
fits me perfectly. I’d fret, worry 
and try to reason my way out of 
difficulties— all to no avail; then 
I’d have a hunch, a something 
within that would tell me to do 
a certain thing. I’d laugh it off 
with a shrug. I knew too much, I 
thought, to heed. these impres- 
sions. Well, it’s different now — 
I’ve learned to use this inner power 
and I no longer make the mis- 
takes I did, because I do the right 
thing at the right time. 

This FREE BOOK Will Prove 
What Your Mind Can Do( 

Here is how I got started right. 
I had heard about hypnosis reveal- 
ing past lives. I began to think 
there must be some inner intelli- 
gence with which we were born. 
In fact, I often heard it said there 




was; but how could I use it, how 
could I make it work for me daily? 
That was my problem. I wanted 
to learn to direct this inner voice, 
master it if I could. Finally, I wrote 
to the Rosicrucians, a world-wide 
fraternity of progressive men and 
women, who offered to send me, 
without obligation, a free book 
entitled The Mastery of Life. 

That book opened a new world 
to me. I advise you to write today 
and ask for your copy. It will prove 
to you what your mind can demon- 
strate. Don’t go through life 
laughing your mental powers 
away. Simply write: Scribe J.F.W.

WHICH WAY IS PROGRESS? 



TV/fOST of the great debates of 
-L” our time contain built-in 
hypotheses which seldom get 
questioned — because most peo- 
ple engaging in the debates don’t 
know they are there. One com- 
mon one has to do with “progress.” 
We assume that “progress” is 
another word for “change” — 
that is, willy-nilly, the human 
race is on its way up, and every- 
thing that is different is better. 

There isn’t any doubt that 
there has been progress in the 
history of mankind. We are a 
long way from the Sumerians, in 
so many things that it is almost 
impossible to count them. Every- 
one would agree to that. 

But what are we all agreeing 
to? What, specifically, are the 
things that have shown improve- 
ment? 



As a starter, let’s say the pro- 
longation of the average life span. 
Certainly we have done a great 
deal there. Probably it has been 
tripled in historic time, and if 
you define progress in terms of 
longevity we are home free be- 
fore the argument really gets 
started. But — “progress” im- 
plies a goal. What’s the goal here, 
immortality? Obviously there is 
no great merit in that if it is un- 
accompanied by other far-reach- 
ing changes. Never mind how 
much you would like to live for- 
ever; do you want the human 
race to stop evolving because 
there is no room for new gener- 
ations? Or — the only alternative 
in the long run — do you want 
the population so to increase that 
we all starve? (Or to succumb to 
population-pressure psychoses, as

recent animal experiments sug- 
gest may happen?) 

“Progress” in this case, then, 
indicates a change in a direction 
which ultimately changes its sign 
and becomes “regression.” Since 
we can’t locate the point at which 
the change occurs, let’s see if we 
can find an -easier measure of our 
accomplishments. 

Shall we speak of progress in 
providing material comforts for 
the average man? That’s an easy 
concession too . provided we 
know what we mean by “material 
comforts.” The early cultures did 
not give every man a TV set, 
that’s sure; they didn’t have them 
to give. Nor did they provide 
automobiles, for the same reason. 
But let’s not pretend that all of 
the gadgets and contraptions we 
carry on our fiscal backs are pure 
joy! The average man’s budget of 
major machines and appliances 
totals maybe fifty items, from hi- 
fi sets to typewriters, and of the 
fifty perhaps ten are in some way 
or another broken and another 
two or three never worked exactly 
right even when he got them from 
the store. As all suburbanites 
know, there is no “convenience” 
quite so inconvenient as a fully 
automated household when a 
storm or other difficulty cuts off 
the power supply. 

We might, if we wished, meas- 
ure “progress” in terms of diet or 
food production or energy con- 



sumption. Here we find surprises. 
The world average diet, except 
for the rich nations, is hardly one 
calorie higher per capita than it 
was five thousand years ago; that 
is to say, it is at the minimum 
level that will make survival and 
reproduction possible. The pro- 
duction of food per acre of land 
has shown improvement where 
fertilizers and irrigation have 
been applied — that’s a plus — 
but has actually shown decrease 
where agricultural machinery has 
taken over hand-tilling of the soil. 
That’s a minus, and a big one. 
It is true that we now produce 
more food per man-hour ex- 
pended in farming; but man-hours 
are always available, we create 
more of them every time a child 
is born; and the arable land of 
the Earth is a remorselessly fixed 
quantity. 

Energy consumption, then? 
The world average is about 2500 
kilowatt hours per year. This is 
far greater than during the Mid- 
dle Ages, say. But it is far less 
than that of interglacial man, 
50,000 years ago, who burned up 
twice that much each year! 
(Wastefully, it is true. Most of it 
was in the form of great watch- 
fires to keep animals away. But 
Wastefulness is not a sin peculiar 
to primitive man, as we drivers 
of automobiles which convert 
something under 5% of the orig- 
inal heat energy of the petroleum

GALAXY 



into mechanical motion should 
admit.) 

Indeed, we can hardly rely 
even on the arrow of evolution 
to point always “up.” We pride 
ourselves on our great brains, our 
delicately featured faces and 
other marks that distinguish us 
from the apes — but Boskop man 
had a larger brain and a far more 
“human” face; and the last Bos- 
kopoid died a hundred centuries 
ago. 

TTAVING said this much, we 
must not pretend to have 
said the final word. There has 
been progress, and we all know it. 

But let’s be sure we know what 
“progress” we mean — and, more 
important, let’s think about what 
we want “progress” in the future 
to be like. Without such thought 
humanity becomes a race of fa- 
natics. (Under the definition of 
“fanatic” that goes: “One who re- 
doubles his efforts once he has 
lost sight of his goal.”) 

George Orwell made a pene- 
trating and relevant observation 
in his book, The Road to Wigan 
Pier. The time was the 1930s; he 
had been traveling in the ugly 
industrial towns of northern 
England, visiting working-class 
homes where a dozen families 
might use the same communal 
outside lavatory; where eight per- 
sons slept in one room, five in a 
bed; where every green thing had 



been systematically rooted out 
and it was impossible to heat the 
tiny houses to a point where sick- 
ness could be avoided. 

Orwell questioned one of the 
men whose'families lived in these 
“beastly” homes: 

I asked him when the 
housing shortage first be- 
came acute in his district; 
he answered, “When we 
were told about it,” mean- 
ing that till recently people’s 
standards were so low that 
they took almost any degree 
of overcrowding for granted. 

“When we were told about it.” 
Man can reconcile himself to al- 
most anything. He will seek a 
better life if he can — but only 
if he can see the direction in 
which improvement lies. 

It is in helping us to find these 
directions that science-fiction sto- 
ries may serve a useful purpose. 
We need to look somewhat far- 
ther ahead than our grandfathers 
did. The pace of events is very 
quick now. 

If we want “progress” to lead 
us in a direction we will like, we 
need to know what the possible 
directions are. 

For that we need a perspective, 
an opportunity to look at our- 
selves from outside . 

And for that we need science- 
fiction stories! the EDITOR

I 



HTHE apartments of Joaz Ban- 
beck, carved deep from the 
heart of a limestone crag, con- 
sisted of five principal chambers, 
on five different levels. At the 
top were the reliquarium and a 
formal council chamber: the first 
a room of somber magnificence 
housing the various archives, 
trophies and mementos of the 
Banbecks; the second a long nar- 
row hall, with dark wainscoting 
chest-high and a white plaster 
vault above, extending the entire 
width of the crag, so that bal- 
conies overlooked Banbeck Vale 
at one end and Kergan’s Way at 
the other. 

Below were Joaz Banbeck’s 
private quarters: a parlor and 
bed-chamber, then next his study 
and finally, at the bottom, a work- 
room where Joaz permitted none 
but himself. 

Entry to the apartments was 
through the study, a large L- 
shaped room with an elaborate 
groined ceiling, from which de- 
pended four garnet-encrusted 
chandeliers. These were now 
dark. Into the room came only a 
watery gray light from four 
honed-glass plates on which, in 
the manner of a camera obscura, 
were focused views across Ban- 
beck Vale. The walls were pan- 
eled with lignified reed. A rug 



patterned in angles, squares and 
circles of maroon, brown and 
black covered the floor. 

In the middle of the study 
stood a naked man. 

His only covering was the long, 
fine, brown hair which flowed 
down his back, the golden tore 
which clasped his neck. His fea- 
tures were sharp and angular, his 
body thin. He appeared to be lis- 
tening, or perhaps meditating. 
Occasionally he glanced at a yel- 
low marble globe on a nearby 
shelf, whereupon his lips would 
move, as if he were committing to 
memory some phrase or sequence 
of ideas. 

At the far end of the study a 
heavy door eased open. 

A flower-faced young woman 
peered through, her expression 
mischievous, arch. At the sight of 
the naked man, she clapped her 
hands to her mouth, stifling a 
gasp. The naked man turned — 
but the heavy door had already 
swung shut. 

For a moment he stood deep in 
frowning reflection, then slowly 
went to the wall on the inside 
leg of the L. He swung out a 
section of the bookcase and 
passed through the opening. Be- 
hind him the bookcase thudded 
shut. Descending a spiral stair- 
case he came out into a chamber 
rough-hewn from the rock: Joaz 
Banbeck’s private work-room. A 
bench supported tools, metal 



10 



GALAXY 



shapes and fragments, a bank of 
electromotive cells, oddments of 
circuitry: the current objects of 
Joaz Banbeck’s curiosity. 

The naked man glanced at the 
bench. He picked up one of the 
devices and inspected it with 
something like condescension, 
though his gaze was as clear and 
wondering as that of a child. 

Muffled voices from the study 
penetrated to the work-room. The 
naked man raised his head to 
listen, then stooped under the 
bench. He lifted a block of stone, 
slipped through the gap into a 
dark void. Replacing the stone, 
he took up a luminous wand, and 
set off down a narrow tunnel, 
which presently dipped to join a 
natural cavern. At irregular in- 
tervals luminous tubes exuded a 
wan light, barely enough to pierce 
the murk. 

The naked man jogged forward 
swiftly, the silken hair flowing 
like a nimbus behind him. 

T>ACK in the study the min- 
strel-maiden Phade and an 
elderly seneschal were at odds. 
“Indeed I saw him!” Phade in- 
sisted. “With these two eyes of 
mine, one of the sacerdotes, 
standing thus and so, as I have 
described.” She tugged angrily at 
his elbow. “Do you think me be- 
reft of my wits, or hysterical?” 

Rife the seneschal shrugged, 
committing himself neither one 



way nor the other. “I do not see 
him now.” He climbed the stair- 
case, peered into the sleeping par- 
lor. “Empty. The doors above are 
bolted.” He peered owlishly at 
Phade. “And I sat at my post in 
the entry.” 

“You sat sleeping. Even when 
I came past you snored!” 

“You are mistaken; I did but 
cough.” 

“With your eyes closed, your 
head lolling back?” 

Rife shrugged once more. 
“Asleep or awake, it is all the 
same. Admitting that the creature 
gained access, how did he leave? 
I was wakeful after you sum- 
moned me, as you must agree.” 
“Then remain on guard, while 
I find Joaz Banbeck.” Phade ran 
down the passage which presently 
joined Bird Walk, so called for 
the series of fabulous birds of 
lapis, gold, cinnabar, malachite 
and marcasite inlaid into the mar- 
ble. Through an arcade of green 
and gray jade in spiral columns 
she passed out into Kergan’s 
Way, a natural defile which 
formed the main thoroughfare of 
Banbeck Village. Reaching the 
portal, she summoned a pair of 
lads from the fields. “Run to the 
brooder, find Joaz Banbeck! 
Hasten, bring him here; I must 
speak with him.” 

The boys ran off toward a low 
cylinder of black brick a mile to 
the north. 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



11 



Phade waited. With the sun 
Skene at its nooning, the air was 
warm. The fields of vetch, belle- 
garde and spharganum gave off 
a pleasant odor. Phade went to 
lean against a fence. Now she be- 
gan to wonder about the urgency 
of her news, even its basic reality. 
“No!” she told herself fiercely. “I 
saw! I saw!” 

At either side tall white cliffs 
rose to Banbeck Verge, with 
mountains and crags beyond, and, 
spanning all, the dark sky flecked 
with feathers of cirrus. Skene 
glittered dazzling bright, a minus- 
cule flake of brilliance. 

Phade sighed, half-convinced 
of her own mistake. Once more, 
less vehemently, she reassured 
herself. Never before had she 
seen a sacerdote; why should she 
imagine one now? 

The boys, reaching the brooder, 
had disappeared into the dust of 
the exercise pens. Scales gleamed 
and winked; grooms, dragon-mas- 
ters, armorers in black leather 
moved about their work. 

After a moment Joaz Banbeck 
came into view. 

TTE mounted a tall thin-legged 
Spider, urged it to the full 
extent of its head-jerking lope, 
pounded down the track toward 
Banbeck Village. Phade’s uncer- 
tainty grew. Might Joaz become 
exasperated, would he dismiss 
her news with an unbelieving 



stare? Uneasily she watched his 
approach. Coming to Banbeck 
Vale only a month before, she 
still felt unsure of her status. Her 
preceptors had trained her dili- 
gently in the barren little valley 
to the south where she had been 
born, but the disparity between 
teaching and practical reality at 
times bewildered her. She had 
learned that all men obeyed a 
small and identical group of be- 
haviors. Joaz Banbeck, however, 
observed no such limits, and 
Phade found him completely un- 
predictable. She knew him to be 
a relatively young man, though 
his appearance provided no guide 
to his age. He had a pale aus- 
tere face in which gray eyes shone 
like crystals, a long thin mouth 
which suggested flexibility, yet 
never curved far from a straight 
line. He moved languidly; his 
voice carried no vehemence; he 
made no pretense of skill with 
either saber or pistol; he seemed 
deliberately to shun any gesture 
which might win the admiration 
or affection of his subjects. Yet 
he had both. 

Phade originally had thought 
him cold, but presently changed 
her mind. He was, so she decided, 
a man bored and lonely, with a 
quiet humor which at times 
seemed rather grim. But he 
treated her without discourtesy, 
and Phade, testing him with all 
her hundred and one coquetries, 



12 



GALAXY 



not infrequently thought to de- 
tect a spark of response. 

Joaz Banbeck dismounted 
from the Spider, ordered it back 
to its quarters. Phade came dif- 
fidently forward, and Joaz 
turned her a quizzical look. 
“What requires so urgent a sum- 
mons? Have you remembered 
the nineteenth location?” 

Phade flushed in confusion. 
Artlessly she had described the 
painstaking rigors of her training; 
Joaz now referred to an item in 
one of the classifications which 
had slipped her mind. 

Phade spoke rapidly, excited 
once more. “I opened the door 
into your study, softly, gently. 
And what did I see? A sacerdote, 
naked in his hair! He did not 
hear me. I shut the door, I ran 
to fetch Rife. When we returned 
— the chamber was empty!” 
Joaz’s eyebrows contracted a 
trifle; he looked up the valley. 
“Odd.” After a moment he asked, 
“You are sure that he saw noth- 
ing of you?” 

“No. I think not. Yet, when I 
returned with stupid old Rife he 
had disappeared! Is it true that 
they know magic?” 

“As to that, I cannot say,” re- 
plied Joaz. 

^T'HEY returned up Kergan’s 
Way, traversed tunnels and 
rock-walled corridors, finally 
came to the entry chamber. 



Rife once more dozed at his 
desk. Joaz signaled Phade back 
and, going quietly forward, thrust 
aside the door to his study. He 
glanced here and there, nostrils 
twitching. 

The room was empty. 

He climbed the stairs, investi- 
gated the sleeping-parlor, re- 
turned to the study. Unless magic 
were indeed involved, the sacer- 
dote had provided himself a sec- 
ret entrance. With this thought in 
mind, he swung back the book- 
case door, descended to the 
workshop and again tested the 
air for the sour-sweet odor of 
the sacerdotes. A trace? Possibly. 

Joaz examined the room inch 
by inch, peering from every angle. 
At last, along the wall below the 
bench, he discovered a barely per- 
ceptible crack, marking out an 
oblong. 

Joaz nodded with dour satis- 
faction. He rose to his feet and 
returned to his study. He con- 
sidered his shelves: what was here 
to interest a sacerdote? Books, 
folios, pamphlets? Had they even 
mastered the art of reading? 
When next I meet a sacerdote I 
must inquire, thought Joaz vague- 
ly; at least he will tell me the 
truth. On second thought, he 
knew the question to be ludi- 
crous; the sacerdotes, for all their 
nakedness, were by no means bar- 
barians, and in fact had provided 
him his four vision-panes — a 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

technical engineering feat of no 
small skill. 

He inspected the yellowed 
marble globe which he considered 
his most valued possession: a 
representation of mythical Eden. 
Apparently it had not been dis- 
turbed. Another shelf displayed 
models of the Banbeck dragons: 
the rust-red Termagant; the 
Long-horned Murderer and its 
cousin the Striding Murderer; the 
Blue Horror; the Fiend, low to 
the ground, immensely strong, tail 
tipped with a steel barbell; the 
ponderous Jugger, skullcap pol- 
ished and white as an egg. A little 
apart stood the progenitor of the 
entire group: a pearl-pallid crea- 
ture upright on two legs, with two 
versatile central members, a pair 
of multi-articulated brachs at the 
neck. 

Beautifully detailed though 
these models might be, why 
should they pique the curiosity 
of a sacerdote? No reason what- 
ever, when most of the originals 
could be studied daily without 
hindrance. 

What of the workshop, then? 
Joaz rubbed his long pale chin. 
He had no illusions about the 
value of his work. It was idle 
tinkering and no more. Joaz put 
aside conjecture. Most likely the 
sacerdote had come upon no 
specific mission, the visit perhaps 
being part of a continued inspec- 
tion. But why? 



A pounding at the door: old 
Rife’s irreverent fist. Joaz opened 
to him. 

“Joaz Banbeck, a notice from 
Ervis Carcolo of Happy Valley. 
He wishes to confer with you, and 
at this moment awaits your re- 
sponse on Banbeck Verge.” 

“Very well,” said Joaz. “I will 
confer with Ervis Carcolo.” 

“Here? Or on Banbeck Verge?” 
“On the Verge, in half an hour.” 

II 

f'T'EN miles from Banbeck Vale, 
-*• across a wind-scoured wilder- 
ness of ridges, crags, spines of 
stone, amazing crevasses, barren 
fells and fields of tumbled bould- 
ers, lay Happy Valley. As wide 
as Banbeck Vale but only half 
as long and half as deep, its bed 
of wind-deposited soil was only 
half as thick and correspondingly 
less productive. 

The Chief Councillor of Hap- 
py Valley was Ervis Carcolo, a 
thick-bodied short legged man 
with a vehement face, a heavy 
mouth, a disposition by turns 
jocose and wrathful. Unlike Joaz 
Banbeck, Carcolo enjoyed noth- 
ing more than his visits to the 
dragon barracks, where he treated 
dragon-masters, grooms and drag- 
ons alike to a spate of bawled 
invective. 

Ervis Carcolo was an energetic 
man, intent upon restoring Hap-

py Valley to the ascendancy it 
had enjoyed some twelve genera- 
tions before. During those harsh 
times, before the advent of the 
dragons, men fought their own 
battles. The men of Happy Valley 
had been notably daring, deft and 
ruthless. Banbeck Vale, the Great 
Northern Rift, Clewhaven, Sadro 
Valley, Phosphor Gulch: all ac- 
knowledged the authority of the 
Carcolos. 

Then down from space came 
a ship of the Basics, or grephs, as 
they were known at that time. 
The ship killed or took prisoner 
the entire population of Clew- 
haven. It attempted as much in 
the Great Northern Rift, but only 
partially succeeded; then bom- 
barded the remaining settlements 
with explosive pellets. 

When the survivors crept back 
to their devastated valleys, the 
dominance of Happy Valley was 
a fiction. A generation later, dur- 
ing the Age of Wet Iron, even the 
fiction collapsed. In a climactic 
battle Goss Carcolo was captured 
by Kergan Banbeck and forced 
to emasculate himself with his 
own knife. 

Five years of peace elapsed, 
and then the Basics returned. 
After depopulating Sadro Valley, 
the great black ship landed in 
Banbeck Vale, but the inhabitants 
had taken warning and had fled 
into the mountains. Toward night- 
fall twenty-three of the Basics 



sallied forth behind their precise- 
ly trained warriors: several pla- 
toons of Heavy Troops, a squad 
of Weaponeers — these hardly 
distinguishable from the men of 
Aerlith — and a squad of Track- 
ers: these emphatically different. 
The sunset storm broke over the 
Vale, rendering the flyers from 
the ship useless, which allowed 
Kergan Banbeck to perform the 
amazing feat which made his 
name a legend on Aerlith. Rather 
than joining the terrified flight 
of his people to the High Jambles, 
he assembled sixty warriors and 
shamed them to courage with 
jeers and taunts. 

It was a suicidal venture — 
fitting the circumstances. 

Leaping from ambush they 
hacked to pieces one platoon of 
the Heavy Troops, routed the 
others, and captured the twenty- 
three Basics almost before they 
realized that anything was amiss. 
The Weaponeers stood back, 
frantic with frustration, unable to 
use their weapons for fear of 
destroying their masters. The 
Heavy Troopers blundered for- 
ward to attack, halting only when 
Kergen Banbeck performed an 
unmistakable pantomime to 
make it clear that the Basics 
would be the first to die. 

Confused, the Heavy Troopers 
drew back. Kergan Banbeck, his 
men and the twenty-three cap- 
tives escaped into the darkness.

nPHE long Aerlith night passed. 

The dawn storm swept out of 
the east, thundered overhead, re- 
treated majestically into the 
west; Skene rose like a blazing 
atom. 

Three men emerged from the 
Basic ship; a Weaponeer and a 
pair of Trackers. They climbed 
the cliffs to Banbeck Verge, while 
above flitted a small Basic flyer, 
no more than a buoyant platform, 
diving and veering in the wind 
like a poorly balanced kite. The 
three men trudged south toward 
the High Jambles, a region of 




chaotic shadows and lights, 
splintered rock and fallen crags, 
boulders heaped on boulders. It 
was the traditional refuge of 
hunted men. 

Halting in front of the Jam- 
bles, the Weaponeer called out 
for Kergan Banbeck, asking him 
to parley. 

Kergan Banbeck came forth. 
There ensued the strangest col- 
loquy in the history of Aerlith. 
The Weaponeer spoke the lan- 
guage of men with difficulty, his 
lips, tongue and glottal passages 
more adapted to the language of 
the Basics. 

“You are restraining twenty- 
three of our Revered. It is neces- 
sary that you usher them forth, 
in all humility.” He spoke soberly, 
with an air of gentle melancholy, 
neither asserting, commanding 
nor urging. As his linguistic habits 
had been shaped to Basic pat- 
terns, so had his mental processes. 

Kergan Banbeck, a tall spare 
man with varnished black eye- 
brows, black hair shaped and var- 
nished into a crest of five tall 
spikes, gave a bark of humorless 
laughter. “What of the Aerlith 
folk killed, what of the folk seized 
aboard your ship?” 

The Weaponeer bent forward 
earnestly, himself an impressive 
man with a noble aquiline head. 
He was hairless except for small 
rolls of wispy yellow fleece. His 
skin shone as if burnished. His 



16 



GALAXY 




ears, where he differed most 
noticeably from the unadapted 
men of Aerlith, were small, fragile 
flaps. He wore a simple garment 
of dark blue and white, carried no 
weapons save a small multi-pur- 
pose ejector. With complete poise 
and quiet reasonableness he re- 
sponded to Kergan Banbeck’s 
question: “The Aerlith folk who 
have been killed are dead. Those 
aboard the ship will be merged 
into the under-stratum, where 
the infusion of fresh blood is of 
value.” 

Kergan Banbeck inspected the 
Weaponeer with contemptuous 
deliberation. In some respects, 
thought Kergan Banbeck, this 
modified and carefully inbred 
man resembled the sacerdotes of 
his own planet, notably in the 
clear fair skin, the strongly mod- 
eled features, the long legs and 
arms. 

Perhaps telepathy was at work, 
or perhaps a trace of the char- 
acteristic sour-sweet odor had 
been carried to him: turning his 
head he noticed a sacerdote 
standing among the rocks not 
fifty feet way — a man naked 
except for his golden tore and 
long brown hair blowing behind 
him like a pennant. By the an- 
cient etiquette, Kergan Banbeck 
looked through him, pretended 
that he had no existence. The 
Weaponeer after a swift glance 
did likewise. 



“I demand that you release the 
folk of Aerlith from your ship,” 
said Kergan Banbeck in a flat 
voice. 

The Weaponeer smilingly 
shook his head, bent his best ef- 
forts to the task of making him- 
self intelligible. “These persons 
are not under discussion. Their 
— ” he paused, seeking words — 
“their destiny is . parceled, 
quantum-type, ordained. Estab- 
lished. Nothing can be said more.” 

T^ERGAN Banbeck’s smile be- 
came a cynical grimace. He 
stood aloof and silent while the 
Weaponeer croaked on. The 
sacerdote came slowly forward, 
a few steps at a time. “You will 
understand,” said the Weaponeer, 
“that a pattern for events exists. 
It is the function of such as my- 
self to shape events so that they 
will fit the pattern.” He bent, with 
a graceful sweep of arm, and 
seized a small jagged pebble. 
“Just as I can grind this bit of 
rock to fit a round aperture.” 
Kergan Banbeck reached for- 
ward, took the pebble, tossed it 
high over the tumbled boulders. 
“That bit of rock you shall never 
shape to fit a round hole.” 

The Weaponeer shook his head 
in mild deprecation. “There is 
always more rock.” 

“And there are always more 
holes,” declared Kergan Banbeck. 
“To business then,” said the 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



17 



Weaponeer. “I propose to shape 
this situation to its correct ar- 
rangement.” 

“What do you offer in ex- 
change for the twenty-three 
grephs?” 

The Weaponeer gave his 
shoulder an uneasy shake. The 
ideas of this man were as wild, 
barbaric and arbitrary as the 
varnished spikes of his hair-dress. 
“If you desire I will give you 
instruction and advice, so that — ” 
Kergan Banbeck made a sud- 
den sharp gesture. “I make three 
conditions.” The sacerdote now 
stood only ten feet away, face 
blind, gaze vague. “First,” said 
Kergan Banbeck, “a guarantee 
against future attacks upon the 
men of Aerlith. Five grephs must 
always remain in our custody as 
hostages. Second — further to 
secure the perpetual validity of 
the guarantee — you must de- 
liver me a space-ship, equipped, 
energized and armed. And you 
must instruct me in its use.” 

The Weaponeer threw back his 
head and made a series of bleat- 
ing sounds through his nose. 

“Third,” continued Kergan 
Banbeck, “you must release all 
the men and women presently 
aboard your ship.” 

The Weaponeer blinked, spoke 
rapid hoarse words of amazement 
to the Trackers. They stirred, un- 
easy and impatient, watching 
Kergan Banbeck sidelong as if 



he were not only savage, but mad. 
Overhead hovered the flyer; 
the Weaponeer looked up 
and seemed to derive encourage- 
ment from the sight. Turning 
back to Kergan Banbeck with a 
firm fresh attitude, he spoke as 
if the previous interchange had 
never occurred. “I have come to 
instruct you that the twenty- 
three Revered must be instantly 
released.” 

Kergan Banbeck repeated his 
own demands. “You must furnish 
me a space-ship, you must raid 
no more, you must release the 
captives. Do you agree, yes or 
no?” 

The ' Weaponeer seemed con- 
fused. “This is a peculiar situa- 
tion — indefinite, unquantizable.” 

“Can you not understand me?” 
barked Kergan Banbeck in ex- 
asperation. He glanced at the 
sacerdote, an act of questionable 
decorum, then performed in man- 
ner completely unconventional: 
“Sacerdote, how can I deal with 
this blockhead? He does not seem 
to hear me.” 

rpHE sacerdote moved a step 
nearer, his face as bland and 
blank as before. Living by a doc- 
trine which proscribed active or 
intentional interference in the af- 
fairs of other men, he could make 
to any question only a specific 
and limited answer. “He hears 
you, but there is no meeting of 



18 



GALAXY 



ideas between you. His thought 
structure is derived from that of 
his masters. It is incommensur- 
able with yours. As to how you 
must deal with him, I cannot say.” 

Kergan Banbeck looked back 
to the Weaponeer. “Have you 
heard what I asked of you? Did 
you understand my conditions 
for the release of the grephs?” 

“I heard you distinctly,” re- 
plied the Weaponeer. “Your 
words have no meaning, they are 
absurdities, paradoxes. Listen to 
me carefully. It is ordained, com- 
plete, a quantum of destiny, that 
you deliver to us the Revered. It 
is irregular, it is not ordainment 
that you should have a ship, or 
that your other demands be met.” 

Kergan Banbeck’s face became 
red. He half-turned toward his 
men but, restraining his anger, 
spoke slowly and with careful 
clarity. “I have something you 
want. You have something I want. 
Let us trade.” 

For twenty seconds the two 
men stared eye to eye. Then the 
Weaponeer drew a deep breath. 
“I will explain in your words, so 
that you will comprehend. Cer- 
tainties — no, not certainties: 
definites . Definites exist. These 
are units of certainty, quanta of 
necessity and order. Existence is 
the steady succession of these 
units, one after the other. The 
activity of the universe can be 
expressed by reference to these 



units. Irregularity, absurdity — 
these are like — half of a man, 
with half of a brain, half of a 
heart, half of all his vital organs. 
Neither are allowed to exist. That 
you hold twenty-three Revered as 
captives is such an absurdity: an 
outrage to the rational flow of the 
universe.” 

Kergan Banbeck threw up his 
hands, turned once more to the 
sacerdote. “How can I halt his 
nonsense? How can I make him 
see reason?” 

The sacerdote reflected. “He 
speaks not nonsense, but rather a 
language you fail to understand. 
You can make him understand 
your language by erasing all 
knowledge and training from his 
mind, and replacing it with pat- 
terns of your own.” 

Kergan Banbeck fought back 
an unsettling sense of frustration 
and unreality. In order to elicit 
exact answers from a sacerdote, 
an exact question was required; 
indeed it was remarkable that 
this sacerdote stayed to be ques- 
tioned. Thinking carefuly, he 
asked, “How do you suggest that 
I deal with this man?” 

“Release the twenty-three 
grephs.” The sacerdote touched 
the twin knobs at the front of his 
golden tore: a ritual gesture in- 
dicating that, no matter how re- 
luctantly, he had performed an 
act which conceivably might al- 
ter the course of the future. Again 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



19 



he tapped his tore and intoned, 
“Release the grephs; he will then 
depart.” 

Kergan Banbeck cried out in 
unrestrained anger. “Who then do 
you serve? Man or greph? Let us 
have the truth! Speak!” 

“By my faith, by my creed, by 
the truth of my tand, I serve no 
one but myself.” The sacerdote 
turned his face toward the great 
crag of Mount Gethron and 
moved slowly off. The wind blew 
his long fine hair to the side. 

17'ERGAN Banbeck watched 
-*-*• him go, then with cold de- 
cisiveness turned back to the 
Weaponeer. “Your discussion of 
certainties and absurdities is in- 
teresting. I feel that you have 
confused the two. Here is certain- 
ty from my viewpoint: I will not 
release the twenty-three grephs 
unless you meet my terms. If you 
attack us further, I will cut them 
in half, to illustrate and realize 
your figure of speech, and perhaps 
convince you that absurdities are 
possible. I say no more.” 

The Weaponeer shook his head 
slowly, pityingly. “Listen, I will 
explain. Certain conditions are 
unthinkable. They are unquan- 
tized, un-destined — ” 

“Go,” thundered Kergan Ban- 
beck. “Otherwise you will join 
your twenty-three revered grephs, 
and I will teach you how real the 
unthinkable can become!” 



The Weaponeer and the two 
Trackers, croaking and mutter- 
ing, turned, retreated from the 
Jambles to Banbeck Verge, de- 
scended into the valley. Over 
them the flyer fluttered like a 
falling leaf. 

Watching from their retreat 
among the crags, the men of Ban- 
beck Vale presently witnessed a 
remarkable scene. Half an hour 
after the Weaponeer had returned 
to the ship, he came leaping forth 
once again: dancing, cavorting. 
Others followed him — Weapon- 
eers, Trackers, Heavy Troopers 
and eight more grephs — all 
jerking, jumping, running back 
and forth in distracted steps. The 
ports of the ship flashed lights of 
various colors, and there came 
a slow rising sound of tortured 
machinery. 

“They have gone mad!” mut- 
tered Kergan Banbeck. He hesi- 
tated an instant, then gave an 
order. “Assemble every man! We 
attack while they are helpless!” 

Down from the High Jambles 
rushed the men of Banbeck Vale. 
As they descended the cliffs, a 
few of the captured men and 
women from Sadro Valley came 
timidly forth from the ship, and 
meeting no restraint fled to free- 
dom across Banbeck Vale. Others 
followed — and now the Ban- 
beck warriors reached the valley 
floor. 

Beside the ship the insanity 



20 



GALAXY 



had quieted. The out-worlders 
huddled quietly beside the hull. 
There came a sudden mind-shat- 
tering explosion: a blankness of 
yellow and white fire. The ship 
disintegrated. A great crater 
marred the valley floor; fragments 
of metal began to fall among the 
attacking Banbeck warrior's. 

Kergan Banbeck stared at the 
scene of destruction. 

Slowly, his shoulders sagging, 
he summoned his people and led 
them back to their ruined valley. 
At the rear, marching single-file, 
tied together with ropes, came the 
twenty-three grephs, dull eyed, 
pliant, already remote from their 
previous existence. 

The texture of Destiny was in- 
evitable. The present circum- 
stances could not apply to twen- 
ty-three of the Revered. The 
mechanism must therefore adjust 
to insure the halcyon progression 
of events. The twenty-three, 
hence, were something other than 
the Revered: a different order of 
creature entirely. 

If this were true, what were 
they? Asking each other the 
question in sad, croaking under- 
tones, they marched down the 
cliff into Banbeck Vale. 

Ill 

A CROSS the long Aerlith years 
the fortunes of Happy Val- 
ley and Banbeck Vale fluctuated 



with the capabilities of the op- 
posing Carcolos and Banbecks. 
Golden Banbeck, Joaz’s grand- 
father, was forced to release Hap- 
py Valley from clientship when 
Uttern Carcolo, an accomplished 
dragon-breeder, produced the 
first Fiends. Golden Banbeck, in 
his turn, developed the Juggers, 
but allowed an uneasy truce to 
continue. 

Further years passed. Ilden 
Banbeck, the son of Golden, a 
frail ineffectual man, was killed 
in a fall from a mutinous Spider. 
With Joaz yet an ailing child, 
Grode Carcolo decided to try his 
chances against Banbeck Vale. 
He failed to reckon with old 
Handel Banbeck, grand-uncle to 
Joaz and Chief Dragon-master. 

The Happy Valley forces were 
routed on Starbreak Fell. Grode 
Carcolo was killed and young 
Ervis gored by a Murderer. For 
various reasons, including Hen- 
del’s age and Joaz’s youth, the 
Banbeck army failed to press to 
a decisive advantage. Ervis Car- 
colo, though exhausted by loss of 
blood and pain, withdrew in some 
degree of order, and for further 
years a suspicious truce held be- 
tween the neighboring valleys. 

Joaz matured into a saturnine 
young man who, if he excited no 
enthusiastic affection from his 
people, at least aroused no violent 
dislike. He and Ervis Carcolo 
were united in a mutual con-

tempt. At the mention of Joaz’s 
study, with its books, scrolls, 
models and plans, its complicated 
viewing-system across Banbeck 
Vale (the optics furnished, it 
was rumored, by the sacerdotes), 
Carcolo would throw up his 
hands in disgust. “Learning? Pah! 
What avails all this rolling in 
bygone vomit? Where does it 
lead? He should have been born 
a sacerdote. He is the same sort 
of sour-mouthed cloud-minded 
weakling!” 

An itinerant named Dae Al- 
vonso, who combined the trades 



of minstrel, child-buyer, psychia- 
trist and chiropractor, reported 
Carcolo’s obloquies to Joaz, who 
shrugged. “Ervis Carcolo should 
breed himself to one of his own 
Juggers,” said Joaz. “He would 
thereby produce an impregnable 
creature with the Jugger’s armor 
and his own unflinching stupid- 
ity.” 

The remark in due course re- 
turned to Ervis Carcolo, and by 
coincidence touched him in a par- 
ticularly sore spot. Secretly he 
had been attempting an innova- 
tion at his brooders: a dragon al- 
most as massive as the Jugger, 
with the savage intelligence and 
agility of the Blue Horror. But 
Ervis Carcolo worked with an 
intuitive and over-optimistic ap- 
proach, ignoring the advice of 
Bast Givven, his Chief Dragon- 
master. 

The eggs hatched; a dozen 
spratlings survived. Ervis Carco- 
lo nurtured them with alternate 
doses of tenderness and objur- 
gation. Eventually the dragons 
matured. 

Carcolo’s hoped-for combina- 
tion of fury and impregnability 
was realized in four sluggish, ir- 
ritable creatures, with bloated 
torsos, spindly legs, insatiable ap- 
petites. (“As if one can breed a 
dragon by commanding it: ‘Ex- 
ist!’ ” sneered Bast Givven to his 
helpers, and advised them: “Be 
wary of the beasts; they are com- 



22 



GALAXY 



petent only at luring you within 
reach of their brachs.”) 

T HE time, effort, facilities and 
provender wasted upon the 
useless hybrid had weakened 
Carcolo’s army. Of the fecund 
Termagants he had no lack. 
There was a sufficiency of Long- 
horned Murderers and Striding 
Murderers; but the heavier and 
more specialized types, especially 
Juggers, were far from adequate 
to his plans. 

The memory of Happy Valley’s 
ancient glory haunted his dreams. 
First he would subdue Banbeck 
Vale; and often he planned the 
ceremony whereby he would re- 
duce Joaz Banbeck to the office 
of apprentice barracks-boy. 

Ervis Carcolo’s ambitions were 
complicated by a set of basic 
difficulties. Happy Valley’s popu- 
lation had doubled but, rather 
than extending the city by 
breaching new pinnacles or driv- 
ing tunnels, Carcolo constructed 
three new dragon brooders, a 
dozen barracks and an enormous 
training compound. The folk of 
the valley could choose either to 
cram the fetid existing tunnels or 
build ramshackle dwellings along 
the base of the cliff. Brooders, bar- 
racks, training compound and 
huts encroached on Happy Val- 
ley’s already inadequate fields. 
Water was diverted from the 
pond to maintain the brooders. 



Enormous quantities of produce 
went to feed dragons. The folk 
of Happy Valley, under-nour- 
ished, sickly, miserable, shared 
none of Carcolo’s aspirations, and 
their lack of enthusiasm infuri- 
ated him. 

In any event, when the itiner- 
ant Dae Alvonso repeated Joaz 
Banbeck’s recommendation that 
Ervis Carcolo breed himself to a 
Jugger, Carcolo seethed with 
choler. “Bah! What does Joaz 
Banbeck know about dragon- 
breeding? I doubt if he under- 
stands his own dragon-talk.” He 
referred to the means by which 
orders and instructions were 
transmitted to the dragons: a 
secret jargon distinctive to every 
army. To learn an opponent’s 
dragon-talk was the prime goal of 
every Dragon-master, for he 
thereby gained a degree of con- 
trol over his enemies’ forces. “I 
am a practical man, worth two of 
him,” Carcolo went on. “Can he 
design, nurture, rear and teach 
dragons? Can he impose disci- 
pline, teach ferocity? No. He 
leaves all this to his Dragon- 
masters, while he lolls on a couch 
eating sweetmeats, campaigning 
only against the patience of his 
minstrel-maidens. They say that 
by astrological divination he pre- 
dicts the return of the Basics, that 
he walks with his neck cocked, 
watching the sky. Is such a man 
deserving of power and a pros- 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



23 



perous life? I say no! Is Ervis 
Carcolo of Happy Valley such a 
man? I say yes, and this I will 
demonstrate!” 

1T|AE Alvonso judiciously held 
up his hand. “Not so fast. He 
is more alert than you think. His 
dragons are in prime condition; 
he visits them often. And as for 
the Basics — ” 

“Do not speak to me of Basics,” 
stormed Carcolo. “I am no child 
to be frightened by bugbears!” 

Again Dae Alvonso held up his 
hand. “Listen. I am serious, and 
you can profit by my news. Joaz 
Banbeck took me into his private 
study — ” 

“The famous study, indeed!” 

“From a cabinet he brought out 
a ball of crystal mounted on a 
black box.” 

“Aha!” jeered Carcolo. “A 
crystal ball!” 

Dae Alvonso went on placidly, 
ignoring the interruption. “I ex- 
amined this globe, and indeed it 
seemed to hold all of space. 
Within it floated stars and 
planets, all the bodies of the 
cluster. ‘Look well,’ said Joaz 
Banbeck, ‘you will never see the 
like of this anywhere. It was built 
by the olden men and brought to 
Aerlith when our people first ar- 
rived.’ 

“ ‘Indeed,’ I said. ‘And what is 
this object?’ 

“ ‘It is a celestial armamentari- 



um,’ said Joaz. ‘It depicts all the 
nearby stars, and their positions 
at any time I choose to specify. 
Now — ’ here he pointed — ‘see 
this white dot? This is our sun. 
See this red star? In the old al- 
manacs it is named Coralyne. It 
swings near us at irregular inter- 
vals, for such is the flow of stars 
in this cluster. These intervals 
have always coincided with the 
attacks of the Basics.’ Here I ex- 
pressed astonishment; Joaz as- 
sured me regarding the matter. 
‘The history of men on Aerlith 
records six attacks by the Basics, 
or grephs as they were originally 
known. Apparently as Coralyne 
swings through space the Basics 
scour nearby worlds for hidden 
dens of humanity. The last of 
these was long ago during the 
time of Kergan Banbeck, with the 
results you know about. At that 
time Coralyne passed close in the 
heavens. For the first time since 
then, Coralyne is once more close 
at hand.’ This,” Alvonso told Car- 
colo, “is what Joaz Banbeck told 
me, and this is what I saw.” 

Carcolo was impressed in spite 
of himself. “Do you mean to tell 
me,” demanded Carcolo, “that 
within this globe swim all the 
stars of space?” 

“As to that, I cannot vouch,” 
replied Dae Alvonso. “The globe 
is set in a black box, and I suspect 
that an inner mechanism projects 
images or perhaps luminous spots 



24 



GALAXY 



which simulate the stars. Either 
way it is a marvelous device, one 
which I would be proud to own. 
I offered Joaz several precious 
objects in exchange. But he would 
have none of them.” 

Carcolo curled his lip in dis- 
gust. “You and your stolen 
children. Have you no shame?” 
“No more than my customers,” 
said Dae Alvonso stoutly. “As I 
recall, I have dealt profitably 
with you on several occasions.” 
Ervis Carcolo turned away, 
pretended to watch a pair of 
Termagants exercising with 
wooden scimitars. The two men 
stood by a stone fence, behind 
which scores of dragons practiced 
evolutions, dueled with spears 
and swords, strengthened their 
muscles. Scales flashed. Dust 
rose up under splayed stamping 
feet. The acrid odor of dragon- 
sweat permeated the air. 

Carcolo muttered. “He is 
crafty, that Joaz. He knew you 
would report to me in detail.” 

D AE Alvonso nodded. “Pre- 
cisely. His words were — but 
perhaps I should be discreet.” He 
glanced slyly toward Carcolo 
from under shaggy white eye- 
brows. 

“Speak,” said Ervis Carcolo 
gruffly. 

“Very well. Mind you, I quote 
Joaz Banbeck. ‘Tell blundering 
old Carcolo that he is in great 



danger. If the Basics return to 
Aerlith, as well they may, Happy 
Valley is absolutely vulnerable 
and will be ruined. Where can 
his people hide? They will be 
herded into the black ship and 
transported to a cold new planet. 
If Carcolo is not completely 
heartless he will drive new tun- 
nels, prepare hidden avenues. 
Otherwise — ’ ” 

“Otherwise what?” demanded 
Carcolo. 

“Otherwise there will be no 
more Happy Valley, and no more 
Ervis Carcolo.’ ” 

“Bah,” said Carcolo in a sub- 
dued voice. “The young jacka- 
napes barks in shrill tones.” 

“Perhaps he extends an honest 
warning. His further words — but 
I fear to offend Your Dignity.” 
“Continue! Speak!” 

“These are his words — but no. 
I dare not repeat them. Essential- 
ly he considers your efforts to 
create an army ludicrous. He con- 
trasts your intelligence unfavor- 
ably to his own. He predicts — ” 
“Enough!” roared Ervis Carco- 
lo, waving his fists. “He is a subtle 
adversary, but why do you lend 
yourself to his tricks?” 

Dae Alvonso shook his frosty 
old head. “I merely repeat, with 
reluctance, that which you de- 
mand to hear. Now then, since 
you have wrung me dry, do me 
some profit. Will you buy drugs, 
elixirs, wambles or potions? I

have here a salve of eternal youth 
which I stole from the Demie 
Sacerdote’s personal coffer. In 
my train are both boy and girl 
children, obsequious and hand- 
some, at a fair price. I will listen 
to your woes, cure your lisp, guar- 
antee a placidity of disposition. 
Or perhaps you would buy drag- 
on eggs?” 

“I need none of those,” grunted 
Carcolo. “Especially dragon’s 
eggs which hatch to lizards. As 
for children, Happy Valley 
seethes with them. Bring me a 
dozen sound Juggers and you 
may depart with a hundred 
children of your choice.” 

Dae Alvonso shook his head 
sadly and lurched away. Carcolo 
slumped against the fence, staring 
across the dragon pens. 

The sun hung low over the 
crags of Mount Despoire. Even- 
ing was close at hand. 

This was the most pleasant 
time of the Aerlith day, when the 
winds ceased, leaving a vast vel- 
vet quiet. Skene’s blaze softened 
to a smoky yellow, with a bronze 
aureole. The clouds of the ap- 
proaching evening storm gath- 
ered, rose, fell, shifted, swirled; 
glowing and changing in every 
tone of gold, orange-brown, gold- 
brown and dusty violet. 

Skene sank; the golds and 
oranges became oak-brown and 
purple. Lightning threaded the 
clouds, and the rain fell in a black 



curtain. In the barracks men 
moved with vigilance, for now the 
dragons became unpredictable: 
by turns watchful, torpid, quarrel- 
some. With the passing of the 
rain, evening became night, and 
a cool quiet breeze drifted 
through the valleys. The dark 
sky began to burn and dazzle 
with the stars of the cluster. One 
of the most effulgent twinkled 
red, green, white, red, green. 

Ervis Carcolo studied this star 
thoughtfully. One idea led to an- 
other, and presently to a course 
of action which seemed to- dis- 
solve the entire tangle of uncer- 
tainties and dissatisfactions which 
marred his life. 

Carcolo twisted his mouth into 
a sour grimace. He must make 
overtures to that popinjay Joaz 
Banbeck. But, if this were un- 
avoidable so be it! 

Hence, the following morning, 
shortly after Phade the minstrel- 
maiden discovered the sacerdote 
in Joaz’s study, a messenger ap- 
peared in the Vale, inviting Joaz 
Banbeck up to Banbeck Verge 
for a conference with Ervis Car- 
colo. 

IV 

t'RVIS Carcolo waited on Ban- 
beck Verge with Chief 
Dragon-master Bast Givven and 
a pair of young fuglemen. Behind, 
in a row, stood their mounts: four 



26 



GALAXY 



glistening Spiders, brachs folded, 
legs splayed at exactly identical 
angles. 

These were Carcolo’s newest 
breed. He was immoderately 
proud of them. The barbs sur- 
rounding the horny visages were 
clasped with cinnabar cabochons; 
a round target enameled black 
and studded with a central spike 
covered each chest. The men 
wore the traditional black leather 
breeches, with short maroon 
cloaks and black leather helmets, 
with long flaps slanting back 
across the ears and down to the 
shoulders. 

The four men waited, patient 
or restless as their natures dic- 
tated, surveying the well-tended 
length of Banbeck Vale. To the 
south stretched fields of various 
food-stuffs: vetch, bellegarde, 

moss-cake, a loquat grove. Direct- 
ly opposite, near the mouth of 
Clybourne Crevasse, the shape of 
the crater created by the explo- 
sion of the Basic ship could still 
be seen. North lay more fields, 
then the dragon compounds, con- 
sisting of black-brick barracks, 
a brooder, an exercise field. Be- 
yond lay Banbeck Jambles — an 
area of wasteland, where ages 
previously a section of the cliff 
had fallen, creating a wilderness 
of tumbled rock, similar to the 
High Jambles under Mount Geth- 
ron, but smaller in compass. 

One of the young fuglemen 



rather tactlessly commented upon 
the evident prosperity of Ban- 
beck Vale. Ervis Carcolo listened 
glumly a moment or two, then 
‘ turned a haughty stare toward 
the offender. 

“Notice the dam,” said the 
fugleman. “We waste half our 
water in seepage.” 

“True,” said the other. “The 
rock facing is a good idea. I won- 
der why we don’t do something 
similar.” 

Carcolo started to speak, but 
thought better of it. With a 
growling sound in his throat, he 
turned away. Bast Givven made 
a sign; the fuglemen hastily fell 
silent. 

A few moments later Givven 
announced: “Joaz Banbeck has 
set forth.” 

Carcolo peered down toward 
Kergan’s Way. “Where is his 
company? Does he choose to ride 
alone?” 

“So it seems.” 

A few minutes later Joaz Ban- 
beck appeared on Banbeck Verge 
riding a Spider caparisoned in 
gray and red velvet. Joaz wore a 
loose lounge cloak of soft brown 
cloth over a gray shirt and gray 
trousers, with a long-billed hat of 
blue velvet. He held up his hand 
in casual greeting. 

Brusquely Ervis Carcolo re- 
turned the salute, and with a jerk 
of his head sent Givven and the 
fuglemen off out of ear-shot.

/"''ARCOLO said gruffly, “You 
^ sent me a message by old 
Alvonso.” 

Joaz nodded. “I trust he ren- 
dered my remarks accurately?” 
Carcolo grinned wolfishly. “At 
times he felt obliged to para- 
phrase.” 

“Tactful old Dae Alvonso.” 

“I am given to understand,” 
said Carcolo, “that you consider 
me rash, ineffectual, callous to the 
best interests of Happy Valley. 
Alvonso admitted that you used 
the word ‘blunderer’ in reference 
to me.” 

Joaz smiled politely. “Senti- 
ments of this sort are best trans- 
mitted through intermediaries.” 
Carcolo made a great show of 
dignified forbearance. “Apparent- 
ly you feel that another Basic 
attack is imminent.” 

“Just so,” agreed Joaz, “if my 
theory, which puts their home by 
the star Coralyne, is correct. In 
which case, as I pointed out to 
Alvonso, Happy Valley is serious- 
ly vulnerable.” 

“And why not Banbeck Vale 
as well?” barked Carcolo. 

Joaz stared at him in surprise. 
“Is it not obvious? I have taken 
precautions. My people are 
housed in tunnels, rather than 
huts. We have several escape 
routes, should this prove neces- 
sary, both to the High Jambles 
and to Banbeck Jambles.” 

“Very interesting.” Carcolo 



made an effort to soften his' voice. 
“If your theory is accurate — 
and I pass no immediate judg- 
ment — then perhaps I would 
be wise to take similar measures. 
But I think in different terms. I 
prefer attack to passive defense.” 
“Admirable,” said Joaz Ban- 
beck. “Important deeds are done 
by men such as you.” 

Carcolo became a trifle pink in 
the face. “This is neither here nor 
there,” he said. “I have come to 
propose a joint project. It is en- 
tirely novel, but carefully thought 
out. I have considered various 
aspects of this matter for several 
years.” 

“I attend you with great in- 
terest,” said Joaz. 

Carcolo blew out his cheeks. 
“You know the legends as well as 
I, perhaps better. Our people 
came to Aerlith as exiles during 
the War of the Ten Stars. The 
Nightmare Coalition apparently 
had defeated the Old Rule, but 
how the war ended — ” he threw 
up his hands — “who can say?” 
“There is a significant indica- 
tion,” said Joaz. “The Basics re- 
visit Aerlith and ravage us at their 
pleasure. We have seen no men 
visiting except those who serve 
the Basics.” 

“Men?” Carcolo demanded 
scornfully. “I call them some- 
thing else. Nevertheless, this is 
no more than a deduction, and 
we are ignorant as to the course 



28 



GALAXY 



of history. Perhaps Basics rule 
the cluster; perhaps they plague 
us only because we are weak and 
weaponless. Perhaps we are the 
last men. Perhaps the Old Rule 
is resurgent. And never forget 
that many years have elapsed 
since the Basics last appeared on 
Aerlith.” 

“Many years have elapsed 
since Aerlith and Coralyne were 
in such convenient apposition.” 

/^ARCOLO made an impatient 
^ gesture. “A supposition, 
which may or may not be rele- 
vant. Let me explain the basic 
axiom of my proposal. It is sim- 
ple enough. I feel that Banbeck 
Vale and Happy Valley are too 



small a compass for men such 
as ourselves. We deserve larger 
scope.” 

Joaz agreed. “I wish it were 
possible to ignore the practical 
difficulties involved.” 

“I am able to suggest a method 
to counter these difficulties,” as- 
serted Carcolo. 

“In that case,” said Joaz, “pow- 
er, glory and wealth are as good 
as ours.” 

Carcolo glanced at him sharp- 
ly, slapped his breeches with the 
gold-beaded tassel to his scab- 
bard. “Reflect,” he said. “The sac- 
erdotes inhabited Aerlith before 
us. How long no one can say. It 
is a mystery. In fact, what do we 
know of the sacerdotes? Next to 




THE DRAGON MASTERS 



29 






nothing. They trade their metal 
and glass for our food. They live 
in deep caverns. Their creed is 
disassociation, reverie, detach- 
ment, whatever one may wish to 
call it — totally incomprehen- 
sible to one such as myself.” He 
challenged Joaz with a look; Joaz 
merely fingered his long chin. 
“They put themselves forward as 
simple metaphysical cultists. Ac- 
tually they are a very mysterious 
people. Has anyone yet seen a 
sacerdote woman? What of the 
blue lights? What of the lightning 
towers, what of the sacerdote 
magic? What of weird comings 
and going by night, what of 
strange shapes moving across the 
sky, perhaps to other planets?” 

“The tales exist, certainly,” 
said Joaz. “As to the degree of 
credence to be placed in them — ” 

“Now we reach the meat of my 
proposal!” declared Ervis Car- 
colo. “The creed of the sacerdotes 
apparently forbids shame or re- 
gard for consequence. Hence, 
they are forced to answer any 
question put to them. Neverthe- 
less, creed or no creed, they com- 
pletely befog any information an 
assiduous man is able to wheedle 
from them.” 

Joaz inspected him curiously. 
“Evidently you have made the 
attempt.” 

Ervis Carcolo nodded. “Why 
should I deny it? I have ques- 
tioned three sacerdotes with de- 



termination and persistence. 
They answered all my questions 
with gravity and calm reflection, 
but told me nothing.” He shook 
his head in vexation. “Therefore, 
I suggest that we apply coercion.” 

“You are a brave man.” 

Carcolo shook his head mod- 
estly. “I would dare no direct 
measures. But they must eat. If 
Banbeck Vale and Happy Valley 
cooperate, we can apply the very 
cogent persuasion of hunger. Pre- 
sently their words may be more 
to the point.” 

Joaz considered a moment or 
two. Ervis Carcolo twitched his 
scabbard tassel. “Your plan,” said 
Joaz at last, “is not a frivolous 
one, and is ingenious — at least 
at first glance. What sort of in- 
formation do you hope to secure? 
In short, what are your ultimate 
aims?” 

/"’ARCOLO sidled close, prod- 
ded Joaz with his forefinger. 
“We know nothing of the outer 
worlds. We are marooned on this 
miserable planet of stone and 
wind while life passes us by. You 
assume that Basics rule the clus- 
ter. But suppose you are wrong? 
Suppose the Old Rule has re- 
turned? Think of the rich cities, 
the gay resorts, the palaces, the 
pleasure-islands! Look up into the 
night sky. Ponder the bounties 
which might be ours! You ask 
how can we implement these de- 



30 



GALAXY 



sires? I respond, the process may 
be so simple that the sacerdotes 
will reveal it without reluctance.” 
“You mean — ” 
“Communication with the 
worlds of men! Deliverance from 
this lonely little world at the edge 
of the universe!” 

Joaz Banbeck nodded dubi- 
ously. “A fine vision. But the evi- 
dence suggests a situation far dif- 
ferent, namely the destruction of 
man and the Human Empire.” 
Carcolo held out his hands in 
gesture of open-minded tolerance. 
“Perhaps you are right. But why 
should we not make inquiries of 
the sacerdotes? Concretely I pro- 
pose as follows: that you and I 
agree to the mutual cause I have 
outlined. Next, we request an 
audience with the Demie Sacer- 
dote. We put our questions. If he 
responds freely, well and good. 
If he evades, then we act to- 
gether. No more food to the sac- 
erdotes until they tell us plainly 
what we want to hear.” 

“Other valleys exist,” said 
Joaz thoughtfully. 

Carcolo made a brisk gesture. 
“We can deter any such trade by 
persuasion or by the power of our 
dragons.” 

“The essence of your idea ap- 
peals to me,” said Joaz. “But I 
fear that all is not so simple.” 
Carcolo rapped his thigh 
smartly with the tassel. “And 
why not?” 



“In the first place, Coralyne 
shines bright in the sky. This is 
our first concern. Should Coral- 
yne pass and the Basics not at- 
tack — then is the time to pursue 
this matter. Again — and perhaps 
more to the point — I doubt that 
we can starve the sacerdotes into 
submission. In fact, I consider it 
impossible.” 

Carcolo blinked. “In what 
wise?” 

“They walk naked through 
sleet and storm; do you think 
they fear hunger? And there is 
wild lichen to be gathered. How 
could we forbid this? You might 
dare some sort of coercion, but 
not I. The tales told of the sacer- 
dotes may be superstition — or 
they may be understatement.” 

Ervis Carcolo heaved a deep 
disgusted sigh. “Joaz Banbeck, I 
took you for a man of decision. 
But you merely pick flaws.” 

“These are not flaws. They are 
major errors which would lead to 
disaster.” 

“Well, then. Do you have any 
suggestions of your own?” 

J OAZ fingered his chin. “If Cor- 
alyne recedes and we are still 
on Aerlith — rather than in the 
hold of the Basic ship — then let 
us plan to plunder the secrets of 
the sacerdotes. In the meantime 
I strongly recommend that you 
prepare Happy Valley against a 
new raid. You are over-extended, 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



31 



with your new brooders and bar- 
racks. Let them rest, while you 
dig yourself secure tunnels!” 
Ervis Carcolo stared straight 
across Banbeck Vale. “I am not 
a man to defend. I attack!” 

“You will attack heat-beams 
and ion-rays with your dragons?” 
Ervis Carcolo turned his gaze 
back to Joaz Banbeck. “Can I con- 
sider us allies in the plan I have 
proposed?” 

“In its broadest principles, cer- 
tainly. However I don’t care to 
cooperate in starving or otherwise 
coercing the sacerdotes. It might 
be dangerous, as well as futile.” 
For an instant Carcolo could 
not control his detestation of Joaz 
Banbeck. His lip curled, his hands 
clenched. “Danger? Pah! What 
danger from a handful of naked 
pacifists?” 

“We do not know that they are 
pacifists. We do know that they 
are men.” 

Carcolo once more became 
brightly cordial. “Perhaps you 
are right. But essentially at least 
we are allies.” 

“To a degree.” 

“Good. I suggest that in the 
case of the attack you fear, we 
act together, with a common 
strategy.” 

Joaz nodded distantly. “This 
might be effective.” 

“Let us coordinate our plans. 
Let us assume that the Basics 
drop down into Banbeck Vale. 



I suggest that your folk take ref- 
uge in Happy Valley, while the 
Happy Valley army joins with 
yours to cover their retreat. And 
likewise, should they attack Hap- 
py Valley, my people will take 
temporary refuge with you in 
Banbeck Vale.” 

Joaz laughed in sheer amuse- 
ment. “Ervis Carcolo, what sort 
of lunatic do you take me for? 
Return to your valley, put aside 
your foolish grandiosities, dig 
yourself protection. And fast! 
Coralyne is bright!” 

Carcolo stood stiffly. “Do I 
understand they you reject my 
offer of alliance?” 

“Not at all. But I cannot un- 
dertake to protect you and your 
people if you will not help your- 
selves. Meet my requirements, 
satisfy me that you are a fit ally 
— then we shall speak further of 
alliance.” 

Ervis Carcolo whirled on his 
heel, signaled to Bast Givven and 
the two young fuglemen. With 
no further word or glance he 
mounted his splendid Spider, 
goaded him into a sudden leaping 
run across the Verge and up the 
slope toward Starbreak Fell. His 
men followed, somewhat less 
precipitously. 

Joaz watched them go, shaking 
his head in sad wonder. Then, 
mounting his own Spider, he re- 
turned down the trail to the floor 
of Banbeck Vale.

V 

T HE long Aerlith day, equiva- 
lent to six of the old Diurnal 
Units, passed. 

In Happy Valley there was 
grim activity, a sense of purpose 
and impending decision. The 
dragons exercised in tighter for- 
mation. The fuglemen and cor- 
nets called orders with harsher 
voices. In the armory bullets were 
cast, powder was mixed, swords 
were ground and honed. 

Ervis Carcolo drove himself 
with dramatic bravado, wearing 
out Spider after Spider as he sent 
his dragons through various evo- 
lutions. In the case of the Happy 
Valley forces, these were for the 
most part Termagants — small 
active dragons with rust-red 
scales, narrow darting heads, 
chisel-sharp fangs. Their brachs 
were strong and well-developed. 
They used lance, cutlass or mace 
with equal skill. A man pitted 
against a Termagant stood no 
chance, for the scales warded off 
bullets as well as any blow the 
man might have strength enough 
to deal. On the other hand a sin- 
gle slash of fang, the rip of a 
scythe-like claw, meant death to 
the man. 

The Termagants were fecund 
and hardy and throve even under 
the conditions which existed in 
the Happy Valley brooders; 



hence their predominance in Car- 
colo’s army. This was a situation 
not to the liking of Bast Givven, 
Chief Dragon-master, a spare 
wiry man with a flat crooked- 
nosed face, eyes black and blank 
as drops of ink on a plate. Habit- 
ually terse and tight-lipped, he 
waxed almost eloquent in oppo- 
sition to the attack upon Ban- 
beck Vale. “Look you, Ervis Car- 
colo. We are able to deploy a 
horde of Termagants, with suf- 
ficient Striding Murderers and 
Long-horned Murderers. But 
Blue Horrors, Fiends and Juggers 
— no! We are lost if they trap 
us on the fells!” 

“I do not plan to fight on the 
fells,” said Carcolo. “I will force 
battle upon Joaz Banbeck. His 
Juggers and Fiends are useless 
on the cliffs. And in the matter 
of Blue Horrors we are almost 
his equal.” 

“You overlook a single diffi- 
culty,” said Bast Givven. 

“And what is this?” 

“The improbability that Joaz 
Banbeck plans to permit all this. 
I allow him greater intelligence 
than that.” 

“Show me evidence!” charged 
Carcolo. “What I know of him 
suggests vacillation and stupidity! 
So we will strike — hard!” Car- 
colo smacked fist into palm. 
“Thus we will finish the haughty 
Banbecks!” 

Bast Givven turned to go. Car-

colo wrathfully called him back. 
“You show no enthusiasm for 
this campaign!” 

“I know what our army can 
do and what it cannot do,” said 
Givven bluntly. “If Joaz Banbeck 
is the man you think he is, we 
might scceed. If he has even the 
sagacity of a pair of grooms I 
listened to ten minutes ago, we 
face disaster.” 

In a voice thick with rage, Car- 
colo said, “Return to your Fiends 
and Juggers. I want them quick 
as Termagants.” 

Bast Givven went his way. 
Carcolo jumped on a nearby 
Spider, kicked it with his heels. 
The creature sprang forward, 
halted sharply, twisted its long 



neck about to look Carcolo in 
the face. Carcolo cried, “Hust, 
hust! Forward at speed, smartly 
now! Show these louts what snap 
and spirit mean!” The Spider 
jumped ahead with such vehe- 
mence that Carcolo tumbled over 
backward, landing on his neck, 
where he lay groaning. 

Grooms came running and as- 
sisted him to a bench where he 
sat cursing in a steady low voice. 
A surgeon examined, pressed, 
prodded, recommended that Car- 
colo take to his couch and ad- 
ministered a sedative potion. 

/^ARCOLO was carried to his 
^ apartments beneath the west 
wall of Happy Valley and placed 



34 



GALAXY 



I 



under the care of his wives. He 
slept for twenty hours. When he 
awoke the day was half gone. 

He wished to arise, but found 
himself too stiff to move and, 
groaning, lay back. Presently he 
called for Bast Givven, who ap- 
peared and listened without com- 
ment to Carcolo’s adjurations. 

Evening arrived. The dragons 
returned to the barracks. There 
was nothing to do now but wait 
for daybreak. 

During the long night Carcolo 
underwent a variety of treat- 
ments: massage, hot baths, in- 
fusions and poultices. He exer- 
cised with diligence, and as the 
night reached its end he declared 
himself fit. Overhead the star 



Coralyne vibrated poisonous 
colors — red, green, white — by 
far the brightest star of the 
cluster. Carcolo refused to look 
up at the star, but its radiance 
struck through the corners of his 
eyes whenever he walked on the 
valley floor. 

Dawn approached. Carcolo 
planned to march at the earliest 
moment the dragons were man- 
ageable. A flickering to the east 
told of the oncoming dawn storm, 
still invisible across the horizon. 
With great caution the dragons 
were mustered from their bar- 
racks and ordered into a march- 
ing column. There were almost 
three hundred Termagants; 
eighty-five Striding Murderers, 




iRNeb muRbeRCR 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



35 



as many Long-horned Murderers; 
a hundred Blue Horrors; fifty-two 
squat, immensely powerful 
Fiends, their tails tipped with 
spiked steel balls; eighteen Jug- 
gers. They growled and muttered 
evilly among themselves, watch- 
ing an opportunity to kick each 
other or to snip a leg from an 
unwary groom. Darkness stimu- 
lated their latent hatred for hu- 
manity — though they had been 
taught nothing of their past, nor 
the circumstances by which they 
had become enslaved. 

The dawn lightning blazed, 
outlining the vertical steeples and 
astonishing peaks of the Malheur 
Mountains. Overhead passed the 
storm, with wailing gusts of wind 
and thrashing banks of rain, mov- 
ing on toward Banbeck Vale. The 
east glowed with a gray-green pal- 
lor, and Carcolo gave the signal 
to march. 

Still stiff and sore he hobbled 
to his Spider, mounted, ordered 
the creature into a special and 
dramatic curvet. Carcolo had mis- 
calculated. Malice of the night 
still gripped the mind of the 
dragon. It ended its curvet with a 
lash of the neck which once again 
dashed Carcolo to the ground, 
where he lay half-mad with pain 
and frustration. 

He tried to rise; collapsed; 
tried again; fainted. 

Five minutes he lay uncon- 
scious, then seemed to rouse him- 



self by sheer force of will. “Lift 
me,” he whispered huskily. “Tie 
me into the saddle. We must 
march.” This being manifestly im- 
possible, no one made a move, 
Carcolo raged, finally called 
hoarsely for Blast Givven. “Pro- 
ceed; we cannot stop now. You 
must lead the troops.” 

i^IVVEN nodded glumly. This 
^ was an honor for which he 
had no stomach. 

“You know the battle-plan,” 
wheezed Carcolo. “Circle north 
of the Fang, cross the Skanse with 
all speed, swing north around 
Blue Crevasse, then south along 
Banbeck Verge. There Joaz Ban- 
beck may be expected to discover 
you. You must deploy so that 
when he brings up his juggers 
you can topple them back with 
Fiends. Avoid committing our 
Juggers. Harry him with Terma- 
gants; reserve the Murderers to 
strike wherever he reaches the 
edge. Do you understand me?” 

“As you explain it, victory is 
certain,” muttered Bast Givven. 

“And so it is, unless you blund- 
er grievously. Ah, my back! I 
can’t move. While the great battle 
rages I must sit by the brooder 
and watch eggs hatch! Now go! 
Strike hard for Happy Valley!” 

Givven gave an order. The 
troops set forth. 

Termagants darted into the 
lead, followed by silken Striding 



36 



GALAXY 



Murderers and the heavier Long- 
horned Murderers, their fantastic 
chest-spike tipped with steel. Be- 
hind came the ponderous Juggers, 
grunting, gurgling, teeth clashing 
together with the vibration of 
their steps. Flanking the Juggers 
marched the Fiends, carrying 
heavy cutlasses, flourishing their 
terminal steel balls as a scorpion 
carries his sting. Then at the 
rear came the Blue Horrors, who 
were both massive and quick, 
good climbers, no less intelligent 
than the Termagants. To the 
flanks rode a hundred men: 
dragon-masters, knights, fugle- 
men and cornets. They were 
armed with swords, pistols and 
large-bore blunderbusses. 

Carcolo watched from a 
stretcher till the last of his forces 
had passed from view, then com- 
manded himself carried back to 
the portal which led into the 
Happy Valley caves. 

Never before had the caves 
seemed so dingy and shallow. 
Sourly he eyed the straggle of 
huts along the cliff, built of rock, 
slabs of resin-impregnated lichen, 
canes bound with tar. With the 
Banbeck campaign at an end, he 
would set about cutting new 
chambers and halls into the cliff. 
The splendid decorations of Ban- 
beck Village were well-known. 
Happy Valley would be even 
more magnificent. The halls 
would glow with opal and nacre, 

THE DRAGON MASTERS 



silver and gold . And yet, to 
what end? If events went as 
planned, there was his great 
dream in prospect. And then, 
what consequence a few paltry 
decorations in the tunnels of Hap- 
py Valley? 

Groaning, he allowed himself 
to be laid on his couch and en- 
tertained himself picturing the 
progress of his troops. By now 
they should be working down 
from Dangle Ridge, circling the 
mile-high Fang. 

He tentatively stretched his 
arms, worked his legs. His mus- 
cles protested. Pain shot back and 
forth along his body — but it 
seemed as if the injuries were 
less than before . By now the 
army would be mounting the 
ramparts which rimmed that wide 
area of upland fell known as the 
Skanse . The surgeon brought 
Carcolo a potion. He drank and 
slept, to awake with a start. What 
was the time? His troops might 
well have joined battle! 

He ordered himself carried to 
the outer portal; then, still dis- 
satisfied, commanded his servants 
to transport him across the valley 
to the new dragon brooder, the 
walkway of which commanded a 
view up and down the valley. De- 
spite the protests of his wives, 
here he was conveyed, and made 
as comfortable as bruises and 
sprains permitted. 

He settled himself for an in- 



37 



determinate wait. But news was 
not long in coming. 

rjOWN the North Trail came 
a cornet on a foam-bearded 
Spider. Carcolo sent a groom to 
intercept him and, heedless of 
aches and pains, raised himself 
from his couch. The cornet threw 
himself off his mount, staggered 
up the ramp, sagged exhausted 
against the rail. 

“Ambush!” he panted. “Bloody 
disaster!” 

“Ambush?” groaned Carcolo in 
a hollow voice. “Where?” 

“As we mounted the Skanse 
Ramparts. They waited till our 
Termagants and Murderers were 
over, then charged with Horrors, 
Fiends and Juggers. They cut us 
apart, drove us back, then rolled 
boulders on our Juggers! Our 
army is broken!” 

Carcolo sank back on the 
couch, lay staring at the sky. 
“How many are lost?” 

“I do not know. Givven called 
the retreat. We withdrew in the 
best style possible.” 

Carcolo lay as if comatose. The 
cornet flung himself down on a 
bench. 

A column of dust appeared tp 
the north, which presently dis- 
solved and separated to reveal a 
number of Happy Valley dragons. 
All were wounded. They 
marched, hopped, limped, 

dragged themselves at random, 



croaking, glaring, bugling. First 
came a group of Termagants, 
darting ugly heads from side to 
side; then a pair of Blue Horrors, 
brachs twisting and clasping al- 
most like human arms; then a 
Jugger, massive, toad-like, legs 
splayed out in weariness. Even 
as it neared the barracks it 
toppled, fell with a thud and lay 
still, legs and talons jutting into 
the air. 

Down from the North Trail 
rode Bast Givven, dust-stained 
and haggard. He dismounted 
from his drooping Spider, 
mounted the ramp. With a 
wrenching effort, Carcolo once 
more raised himself on the couch. 

Givven reported in a voice so 
even and light as to seem care- 
less, but even the insensitive Car- 
colo was not deceived. He asked 
in puzzlement: “Exactly where 
did the ambush occur?” 

“We mounted the Ramparts by 
way of Chloris Ravine. Where the 
Skanse falls off into the ravine a 
porphyry outcrop juts up and 
over. Here they awaited us.” 
Carcolo hissed through his 
teeth. “Amazing.” 

Bast Givven gave the faintest 
of nods. 

Carcolo said, “Assume that 
Joaz Banbeck set forth during 
the dawn-storm, an hour earlier 
than I would think possible. As- 
sume that he forced his troops 
at a run. How could he reach the

Skanse Ramparts before us even 

•)» 
s or 

“By my reckoning,” said Giv- 
ven, “ambush was no threat until 
we had crossed the Skanse. I had 
planned to patrol Barchback, all 
the way down Blue Fell and 
across Blue Crevasse.” 

Carcolo gave somber agree- 
ment. “How then did Joaz Ban- 
beck bring his troops to the Ram- 
parts so soon?” 

Givven turned, looked up the 
valley, where wounded dragons 
and men still straggled down the 
North Trail. “I have no idea.” 

“A drug?” puzzled Carcolo. “A 
potion to pacify the dragons? 
Could he have made bivouac on 
the Skanse the whole night long?” 
“The last is possible,” admitted 
Givven grudgingly. “Under Barch 
Spike are empty caves. If he 
quartered his troops here during 
the night, then he had only to 
march across the Skanse to way- 
lay us.” 

Carcolo grunted. “Perhaps we 
have underestimated Joaz Ban- 
beck.” He sank back on his couch 
with a groan. “Well, then, what 
are our losses?” 

1 1 'HE reckoning made dreary 
news. Of the already inade- 
quate squad of Juggers, only six 
remained. From a force of fifty- 
two Fiends, forty survived and of 
these five were sorely wounded. 
Termagants, Blue Horrors and 



Murderers had suffered greatly. 
A large number had been torn 
apart in the first onslaught. Many 
others had been toppled down the 
Ramparts to strew their armored 
husks through the detritus. Of the 
hundred men, twelve had been 
killed by bullets, another fourteen 
by dragon attack. A score more 
were wounded in various degree. 

Carcolo lay back, his eyes 
closed and his mouth working 
feebly. 

“The terrain alone saved us,” 
said Givven. “Joaz Banbeck re- 
fused to commit his troops to the 
ravine. If there were any tactical 
error on either side, it was his. 
He brought an insufficiency of 
Termagants and Blue Horrors.” 

“Small comfort,” growled Car- 
colo. “Where is the balance of 
the army?” 

“We have good position on 
Dangle Ridge. We have seen none 
of Banbeck’s scouts, either man 
or Termagant. He may conceiv- 
ably believe we have retreated to 
the valley. In any event his main 
forces were still collected on the 
Skanse.” 

Carcolo, by an enormous effort, 
raised himself to his feet. 

He tottered across the walk- 
way to look down into the dis- 
pensary. Five Fiends crouched in 
vats of balsam, muttering and 
sighing. A Blue Horror hung in a 
sling, whining as surgeons cut 
broken fragments of armor from 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

its gray flesh. As Carcolo watched, 
one of the Fiends raised itself 
high on its anterior legs, foam 
gushing from its gills. It cried out 
in a peculiar, poignant tone and 
fell back dead into the vat of 
balsam. 

Carcolo turned back to Givven. 
“This is what you must do. Joaz 
Banbeck surely has sent forth 
patrols. Retire along Dangle 
Ridge. Then, taking all conceal- 
ment from the patrols, swing up 
into one of the Despoire Cols. 
Tourmaline Col will serve. This 
is my reasoning. Banbeck will as- 
sume that you are retiring to 
Happy Valley, so he will hurry 
south behind the Fang, to attack 
as you come down off Dangle 
Ridge. As he passes below Tour- 
malone Col, you have the ad- 
vantage. You may well destroy 
Joaz Banbeck there with all his 
troops.” 

Bast Givven shook his head de- 
cisively. “What if his patrols lo- 
cate us in spite of our precau- 
tions? He need only follow our 
tracks to bottle us into Tourma- 
line Col, with no escape except 
over Mount Despoire or out on 
Starbreak Fell. And if we venture 
out on Starbreak Fell his Juggers 
will destroy us in minutes.” 

Ervis Carcolo sagged back 
down upon the couch. “Bring the 
troops back to Happy Valley. We 
will regroup and await another 
occasion.” 

40 



/^UT into the cliff south of the 
^ crag which housed Joaz’s 
apartments was a large chamber 
known as Kergan’s Hall. The pro- 
portions of the room, the simplic- 
ity and lack of ornament, the 
massive antique furniture con- 
tributed to the sense of lingering 
personality, as well as an odor 
unique to the room. This odor 
exhaled from naked stone walls, 
the petrified moss parquetry, old 
wood — a rough ripe redolence 
which Joaz had always disliked, 
together with every other aspect 
of the room. The dimensions 
seemed arrogant in their extent. 
The lack of ornament impressed 
him as rude, if not brutal. One 
day it occurred to Joaz that he 
disliked not the room but Kergan 
Banbeck himself, together with 
the entire system of overblown 
legends which surrounded him. 

The room nevertheless in 
many respects was pleasant. 
Three tall groined windows over- 
looked the vale. The casements 
were set with small square panes 
of green-blue glass in muntins of 
black ironwood. The ceiling like- 
wise was paneled in wood, and 
here a certain amount of the 
typical Banbeck intricacy had 
been permitted. There were mock 
pilaster capitals with gargoyle 
heads, a frieze carved with con- 
ventionalized fern-fronds. The 

GALAXY 






f 



furniture consisted of three 
pieces: two tall carved chairs and 
a massive table, all polished dark 
wood, all of enormous antiquity. 

Joaz had found a use for the 
room. The table supported a care- 
fully detailed relief map of the 
district, on a scale of three inches 
to the mile. At the center was 
Banbeck Vale, on the right hand 
Happy Valley, separated by a 
turmoil of crags and chasms, 
cliffs, spikes, walls and five ti- 
tanic peaks: Mount Gethron to 
the south, Mount Despoire in the 
center, Barch Spike, the Fang and 
Mount Halcyon to the north. 

At the front of Mount Gethron 
lay the High Jambles, then Star- 
break Fell extended to Mount 
» Despoire and Barch Spike. Be- 
yond Mount Despoire, between 
the Skanse Ramparts and Barch- 
back, the Skanse reached all the 
way to the tormented basalt ra- 
vines and bluffs at the foot of 
Mount Halcyon. 

As Joaz stood studying the 
map, into the room came Phade. 
She was mischievously quiet. But 
Joaz sensed her nearness by the 
scent of incense, in the smoke 
of which she had steeped herself 
before seeking out Joaz. She wore 
a traditional holiday costume of 
Banbeck maidens: a tight-fitting 
sheath of dragon intestine, with 
muffs of brown fur at neck, el- 
bows and knees. A tall cylindrical 
hat, notched around the upper 



edge, perched on her rich brown 
curls, and from the top of this 
hat soared a red plume. 

Joaz feigned unconsciousness 
of her presence. She came up be- 
hind him to tickle his neck with 
the fur of her neck-piece. Joaz 
pretended stolid indifference. 
Phade^ not at all deceived, put on 
a face of woeful concern. “Must 
we all be slain? How goes the 
war?” 

“For Banbeck Vale the war 
goes well. For poor Ervis Carcolo 
and Happy Valley the war goes 
ill indeed.” 

“You plan his destruction,” 
Phade intoned in a voice of 
hushed accusation. “You will kill 
him! Poor Ervis Carcolo!” 

“He deserves no better.” 

“But what will befall Happy. 
Valley?” 

Joaz Banbeck shrugged idly. 
“Changes for the better.” 

“Will you seek to rule?” 

“Not I.” 

“Think!” whispered Phade. 
“Joaz Banbeck, Tyrant of Ban- 
beck Vale, Happy Valley, Phos- 
phor Gulch, Glore, the Tarn, 
Clewhaven and the Great North- 
ern Rift.” 

“Not I,” said Joaz. “Perhaps 
you would rule in my stead?” 

“Oh! Indeed! What changes 
there would be! I’d dress the 
sacerdotes in red and yellow rib- 
bons. I’d order them to sing and 
dance and drink May wine. The 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



41 



dragons I’d send south to Arcady, 
except for a few gentle Terma- 
gants to nursemaid the children. 
And no more of these furious bat- 
tles. I’d burn the armor and break 
the swords; I’d — ” 

641%/fY dear little flutterbug,” 
said Joaz with a laugh. 
“What a swift reign you’d have 
indeed!” 

‘Why swift? Why not forever? 
If men had no means to fight — ” 
“And when the Basics came 
down — you’d throw garlands 
around their necks?” 

“Pah. They shall never be 
seen again. What do they gain by 
molesting a few remote valleys?” 
“Who knows what they gain? 
We are free men. Perhaps the 
last free men in the universe. 
Who knows? And will they be 
back? Coralyne is bright in the 
sky!” 

Phade became suddenly in- 
terested in the relief map. “And 
your current war — dread- 
ful. Will you attack, will you 
defend?” 

“This depends on Ervis Car- 
colo,” said Joaz. “I need only wait 
till he exposes himself.” Looking 
down at the map he added 
thoughtfully, “He is clever 
enough to do me damage, unless 
I move with care.” 

“And what if the Basics come 
while you bicker with Carcolo?” 
Joaz smiled. “Perhaps we shall 



all flee to the Jambles. Perhaps 
we shall all fight.” 

“I will fight beside you,” de- 
clared Phade, striking a brave at- 
titude. “We will attack the great 
Basic space-ship, braving the 
heat-rays, fending off the power- 
bolts. We will storm to the very 
portal. We will pull the nose of 
the first marauder who shows 
himself!” 

“At one point your otherwise 
sage strategy falls short,” said 
Joaz. “How does one find the 
nose of a Basic?” 

“In that case,” said Phade, “we 
shall seize their — ” She turned 
her head at a sound in the hall. 
Joaz strode across the room, flung 
back the door. Old Rife the porter 
sidled forward. “You told me to 
call when the bottle either over- 
turned or broke. Well, it’s done 
both.” 

Joaz pushed past Rife, ran 
down the corridor. “What means 
this?” demanded Phade. “Rife, 
what have you said to disturb 
him?” 

Rife shook his head fretfully. 
“I am as perplexed at you. A bot- 
tle is pointed out to me. Watch 
this bottle day and night’ — so 
I am commanded. And also, 
When the bottle breaks or tips, 
call me at once.’ I tell myself that 
here in all truth is a sinecure. And 
I wonder, does Joaz consider me 
so senile that I will rest content 
with a make-work task such as 



42 



GALAXY 



watching a bottle? I am old, my 
jaws tremble, but I am not wit- 
less. To my surprise the bottle 
breaks! The explanation admit- 
tedly is simple. It fell to the floor. 
Nevertheless, without knowledge 
of what it all means, I obey orders 
and notify Joaz Banbeck.” 

Phade had been squirming im- 
patiently. “Where then is this bot- 
tle?” 

“In the studio of Joaz Ban- 
beck.” 

Phade ran off as swiftly as the 
tight sheath about her thighs per- 
mitted: through a transverse tun- 
nel, across Kergan’s Way by a 
covered bridge, then up at a slant 
toward Joaz’s apartments. 

Down the long hall ran Phade, 
through the anteroom where a 
bottle lay shattered on the floor, 
into the studio, where she halted 
in astonishment. No one was to 
be seen. She noticed a section of 
shelving which stood at an angle. 
Quietly, timorously, she stole 
across the room, peered down 
into the workshop. 

rpHE scene was an odd one. 
■*- Joaz stood negligently, smil- 
ing a cool smile, as across the 
room a naked sacerdote gravely 
sought to shift a barrier which 
had sprung down across an area 
of the wall. But the gate was cun- 
ningly locked in place, and the 
sacerdote’s efforts were to no 
avail. 



He turned, glanced briefly at 
Joaz, then started for the exit 
into the studio. 

Phade sucked in her breath 
and backed away. 

The sacerdote came out into 
the studio, started for the door. 

“Just a moment,” said Joaz. “I 
wish to speak to you.” 

The sacerdote paused, turned 
his head in mild inquiry. He was 
a young man, his face bland, 
blank, almost beautiful. Fine 
transparent skin stretched over 
his pale bones. His eyes — wide, 
blue, innocent — seemed to stare 
without focus. He was delicate of 
frame and sparsely fleshed. His 
hands were thin, with fingers 
trembling in some kind of ner- 
vous imbalance. Down his back, 
almost to his waist, hung the 
mane of long light-brown hair. 

Joaz seated himself with osten- 
tatious deliberation, never taking 
his eyes from the sacerdote. Pres- 
ently he spoke in a voice pitched 
at an ominous level. “I find your 
conduct far from ingratiating.” 
This was a declaration requiring 
no response, and the sacerdote 
made none. 

“Please sit,” said Joaz. He in- 
dicated a bench. “You have a 
great deal of explaining to do.” 

Was it Phade’s imagination? Or 
did a spark of something like 
wild amusement flicker and die 
almost instantaneously in the 
sacerdote’s eyes? But again he 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



43 



made no response. Joaz, adapting 
to the peculiar rules by which 
communication with the sacer- 
dotes must be conducted, asked, 
“Do you care to sit?” 

“It is immaterial,” said the 
sacerdote. “Since I am standing 
now, I will stand.” 

Joaz rose to his feet and per- 
formed an act without precedent. 
He pushed the bench behind the 
sacerdote, rapped the back of the 
knobby knees, thrust the sacer- 
dote firmly down upon the bench. 
“Since you are sitting now,” said 
Joaz, “you might as well sit.” 
With gentle dignity the sacer- 
dote regained his feet. “I shall 
stand.” 

Joaz shrugged. “As you wish. I 
intend to ask you some questions. 
I hope that you will cooperate 
and answer with precision.” 

The sacerdote blinked owlish- 

ly- 

“Will you do so?” 

“Certainly. I prefer, however, 
to return the way I came.” 

Joaz ignored the remark. 
“First,” he asked, “why do you 
come to my study?” 

The sacerdote spoke carefully, 
in the voice of one talking to a 
child. “Your language is vague. I 
am confused and must not re- 
spond, since I am vowed to give 
only truth to anyone who re- 
quires it.” 

Joaz settled himself in his 
chair. “There is no hurry. I am 

44 



ready for a long discussion. Let 
me ask you then: did you have 
impulses which you can explain 
to me, which persuaded or im- 
pelled you to come to my studio?” 
“Yes.”- 

“How many of these impulses 
did you recognize?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“More than one?” 

“Perhaps.” 

“Less than ten?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Hmm . Why ar.e you un- 
certain?” 

“I am not uncertain.” 

“Then why can’t you specify 
the number as I requested?” 
“There is no such number.” 

“I see ... You mean, possibly, 
that there are several elements of 
a single motive which directed 
your brain to signal your muscles 
in order that they might carry 
you here?” 

“Possibly.” 

Joaz’s thin lips twisted in a 
faint smile of triumph. “Can you 
describe an element of the even- 
tual motive?” 

“Yes.” 

“Do so, then.” 

r | ''HERE was an imperative, 
against which the sacerdote 
was proof. Any form of coercion 
known to Joaz — fire, sword, 
thirst, mutilation — these to a 
sacerdote were no more than in- 
conveniences; he ignored them as 

GALAXY 



if they did not exist. His personal 
inner world was the single world 
0 f reality. Either acting upon or 
reacting against the affairs of the 
Utter Men demeaned him. Ab- 
solute passivity and absolute can- 
dor were his necessary courses of 
action. Understanding something 
of this, Joaz rephrased his com- 
mand: “Can you think of an ele- 
ment of the motive which im- 
pelled you to come here?” 

“Yes.” 

“What is it?” 

“A desire to wander about.” 

“Can you think of another?” 

“Yes.” 

“What is it?” 

“A desire to exercise myself by 
walking.” 

“I see . Incidentally, are you 
trying to evade answering my 
question?” 

“I answer such questions as you 
put to me. So long as I do so, so 
long as I open my mind to all who 
seek knowledge — for this is our 
creed — there can be no question 
of evasion.” 

“So you say. However, you 
have not provided me an answer 
that I find satisfactory.” 

The sacerdote’s reply to the 
comment was an almost imper- 
ceptible widening of the pupils. 

“Very well then,” said Joaz 
Banbeck. “Can you think of an- 
other element to this complex 
motive we have been discussing?” 

“Yes.” 



“What is it?” 

“I am interested in antiques. I 
came to your study to admire 
your relics of the old worlds.” 
“Indeed?” Joaz raised his eye- 
brows. “I am lucky to possess 
such fascinating treasures. Which 
of my antiques interests you par- 
ticularly?” 

“Your books. Your maps. Your 
great globe of the Arch-world.” 
“The Arch-world? Eden?” 
“This is one of its names.” 

Joaz pursed his lips. “So you 
come here to study my antiques. 
Well then, what other elements 
to this motive exist?” 

The sacerdote hesitated an in- 
stant. “It was suggested to me 
that I come here.” 

“By whom?” 

“By the Demie.” 

“Why did he so suggest?” 

“I am uncertain.” 

“Can you conjecture?” 

“Yes.” 

“What are these conjectures?” 
The sacerdote made a small 
bland gesture with the fingers of 
one hand. “The Demie might wish 
to become an Utter Man, and so 
seeks to learn the principles of 
your existence. Or the Demie 
might wish to change the trade 
articles. The Demie might be fas- 
cinated by my descriptions of 
your antiques. Or the Demie 
might be curious regarding the 
focus of your vision-panels. Or — ” 
“Enough. Which of these con- 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



45 



jectures, and of other conjectures 
you have not yet divulged, do 
you consider most probable?” 
“None.” 

J OAZ raised his eyebrows once 
more. “How do you justify 
this?” 

“Since any desired number of 
conjectures can be formed, the 
denominator of any probability- 
ratio is variable and the entire 
concept becomes arithmetically 
meaningless.” 

Joaz grinned wearily. “Of the 
conjectures which to this mo- 
ment have occurred to you, 
which do you regard as the most 
likely?” 

“I suspect that the Demie 
might think it desirable that I 
come here to stand.” 

“What do you achieve by 
standing?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Then the Demie does not send 
you here to stand.” 

To Joaz’s assertion, the sacer- 
dote made no comment. 

Joaz framed a question with 
great care. “What do you believe 
that the Demie hopes you will 
achieve by coming here to stand?” 
“I believe that he wishes me to 
learn how Utter Men think.” 

“And you learn how I think by 
coming here?” 

“I am learning a great deal.” 
“How does it help you?” 

“I don’t know.” 



“How many times have you 
visited my study?” 

“Seven times.” 

“Why were you chosen special- 
ly to come?” 

“The synod has approved my 
tand. I may well be the next 
Demie.” 

Joaz spoke over his shoulder to 
Phade. “Brew tea.” He turned 
back to the sacerdote. “What is 
a tand?” 

The sacerdote took a deep 
breath. “My tand is the represen- 
tation of my soul.” 

“Hmm. What does it look 
like?” 

The sacerdote’s expression was 
unfathomable. “It cannot be de- 
scribed.” 

“Do I have one?” 

“No.” 

Joaz shrugged. “Then you can 
read my thoughts.” 

Silence. 

“Can you read my thoughts?” 

“Not well.” 

“Why should you wish to read 
my thoughts?” 

“We are alive in the universe 
together. Since we are not per- 
mitted to act, we are obliged to 
know.” 

Joaz smiled skeptically. “How 
does knowledge help you, if you 
will not act upon it?” 

“Events follow the Rationale, 
as water drains into a hollow and 
forms a pool.” 

“Bah!” said Joaz, in sudden ir- 



46 



GALAXY 



station. “Your doctrine commits 
you to non-interference in our 
affairs, nevertheless you allow 
your ‘Rationale’ to creat condi- 
tions by which events are influ- 
enced. Is this correct?” 

“I am not sure. We are a pas- 
sive people.” 

“Still, your Demie must have 
had a plan in mind when he sent 
you here. Is this not correct?” 

“I cannot say.” 

Joaz veered to a new line of 
questioning. “Where does the 
tunnel behind my workshop 
lead?” 

“Into a cavern.” 

P HADE set a silver pot before 
Joaz. He poured and sipped 
reflectively. Of contests there 
were numberless varieties. He 
and the sacerdote were engaged 
in a hide-and-seek game of words 
and ideas. The sacerdote was 
schooled in patience and supple 
evasions, to counter which Joaz 
could bring pride and determina- 
tion. The sacerdote was handi- 
capped by an innate necessity to 
speak truth. Joaz, on the other 
hand, must grope like a man 
blindfolded, unacquainted with 
the goal he sought, ignorant of the 
prize to be won. Very well, 
thought Joaz, let us continue. We 
shall see whose nerves fray first. 
He offered tea to the sacerdote, 
who refused with a shake of the 
head so quick and of such small 



compass as to seem a shudder. 

Joaz made a gesture signifying 
it was all the same to him. 
“Should you desire sustenance 
or drink,” he said, “please let it be 
known. I enjoy our conversation 
so inordinately that I fear I may 
prolong it to the limits of your 
patience. Surely you would pre- 
fer to sit?” 

“No.” 

“As you wish. Well, then, back 
to our discussion. This cavern you 
mentioned: is it inhabited by 
sacerdotes?” 

“I fail to understand your 
question.” 

“Do sacerdotes use the cav- 
ern?” 

“Yes.” 

Eventually, fragment by frag- 
ment, Joaz extracted the infor- 
mation that the cavern connected 
with a series of chambers, in 
which the sacerdotes smelted 
metal, boiled glass, ate, slept, per- 
formed their rituals. At one time 
there had been an opening into 
Banbeck Vale, but long ago this 
had been blocked. Why? There 
were wars throughout the cluster; 
bands of defeated men were tak- 
ing refuge upon Aerlith, settling 
in rifts and valleys. The sacer- 
dotes preferred a detached exist- 
ence and had shut their caverns 
away from sight. Where was this 
opening? The sacerdote seemed 
vague. To the north end of the 
valley. Behind Banbeck Jambles? 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



47 



Possibly. But trading between 
men and sacerdotes was con- 
ducted at a cave entrance below 
Mount Gethron. Why? A matter 
of usage, declared the sacerdote. 
In addition this location was more 
readily accessible to Happy Val- 
ley and Phosphor Gulch. How 
many sacerdotes lived in these 
caves? Uncertainty. Some might 
have died, others might have been 
born. Approximately how many 
this morning? Perhaps five hun- 
dred. 

At this juncture the sacerdote 
was swaying and Joaz was hoarse. 
“Back to your motive — or the 
elements of your motives — for 
coming to my studio. Are they 
connected in any manner with the 
star Coralyne, and a possible new 
coming of the Basics, or the 
grephs, as they were formerly 
called?” 

Again the sacerdote seemed to 
hesitate. Then: “Yes.” 

“Will the sacerdotes help us 
against the Basics, should they 
come?” 

“No.” This answer was terse 
and definite. 

“But I assume that the sacer- 
dotes wish the Basics driven off?” 

No answer. 

Joaz rephrased his words. “Do 
the sacerdotes wish the Basics 
repelled from Aerlith?” 

“The Rationale bids us stand 
aloof from affairs of men and 
non-men alike.” 



Joaz curled his lip. “Suppose 
the Basics invaded your cave and 
dragged you off to the Coralyne 
planet. Then what?” 

r T , HE sacerdote almost seemed 
to laugh. “The question can- 
not be answered.” 

“Would you resist the Basics 
if they made the attempt?” 

“I cannot answer your ques- 
tion.” 

Joaz laughed. “But the answer 
is not no?” 

The sacerdote assented. 

“Do you have weapons, then?” 
The sacerdote’s mild blue eyes 
seemed to droop. Secrecy? Fa- 
tigue? Joaz repeated the question. 

“Yes,” said the sacerdote. His 
knees sagged, but he snapped 
them tight. 

“What kind of weapons?” 
“Numberless varieties. Projec- 
tiles, such as rocks. Piercing weap- 
ons, such as broken sticks. Cutting 
and slashing weapons, such as 
cooking utensils.” His voice be- 
gan to fade as if he were moving 
away. “Poisons: arsenic, sulfur, 
triventidum, acid, black-spore. 
Burning weapons, such as torches 
and lenses to focus the sunlight. 
Weapons to suffocate: ropes, 

nooses, slings and cords. Cisterns, 
to drown the enemy . .” 

“Sit down. Rest,” Joaz urged 
him. “Your inventory interests 
me, but its total effect seems in- 
adequate. Have you other weap- 



48

ons which might decisively repel 
t he Basics should they attack 
your 

The question, by design or 
chance, was never answered. The 
sacerdote sank to his knees, slow- 
ly, as if praying. He fell forward 
on his face, then sprawled to the 
side. Joaz sprang forward, yanked 
up the drooping head by its hair. 
The eyes, half-open, revealed a 
hideous white expanse. “Speak!” 
croaked Joaz. “Answer my last 
question! Do you have weapons 
. — or a weapon — to repel a 
Basic attack?” 

The pallid lips moved. “I don’t 
know.” 

Joaz frowned, peered into the 
waxen face, drew back in bewil- 
derment. “The man is dead,” he 
whispered. 

VII 

■pHADE looked up from drows- 
ing on a couch, face pink, 
hair tossed. “You have killed 
him!” she cried in a voice of 
hushed horror. 

“No. He has died — or caused 
himself to die.” 

Phade staggered blinking 
across the room, sidled close to 
Joaz, who pushed her absently 
away. Phade scowled, shrugged 
and then, as Joaz paid her no 
heed, marched from the room. 

Joaz sat back, staring at the 
limp body. “He did not tire,” mut- 



tered Joaz, “until I verged upon 
secrets.” 

Presently he jumped to his 
feet, went to the entry hall, sent 
Rife to fetch a barber. An hour 
later the corpse, stripped of hair, 
lay on a wooden pallet covered by 
a sheet, and Joaz held in his 
hands a rude wig fashioned from 
the long hair. 

The barber departed. Servants 
carried away the corpse. Joaz 
stood alone in his studio, tense 
and light-headed. He removed his 
garments, to stand naked as the 
sacerdote. Gingerly he drew the 
wig across his scalp and examined 
himself in a mirror. To a casual 
eye, where the difference? Some- 
thing was lacking: the tore. Joaz 
fitted it about his neck. Once 
more he examined his reflection, 
with dubious satisfaction. 

He entered the workshop, hes- 
itated, disengaged the trap, cau- 
tiously pulled away the stone 
slab. On hands and knees he 
peered into the tunnel and, since 
it was dark, held forward a glass 
vial of luminescent algae. In the 
faint light the tunnel seemed 
empty. 

Irrevocably putting down his 
fears, Joaz clambered through the 
opening. The tunnel was narrow 
and low. Joaz moved forward ten- 
tatively, nerves thrilling with 
wariness. He stopped often to j 
listen, but heard nothing but the 
whisper of his own pulse. 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



49 



After perhaps a hundred yards 
the tunnel broke out into a 
natural cavern. Joaz stopped and 
stood indecisively straining his 
ears through the gloom. Lumi- 
nescent vials fixed to the walls at 
irregular intervals provided a 
measure of light, enough to de- 
lineate the direction of the cav- 
ern. It seemed to be north, par- 
allel to the length of the valley. 
Joaz set forth once again, halting 
to listen every few yards. 

To the best of his knowledge 
the sacerdotes were a mild un- 
aggressive folk, but they were 
also intensely secretive. How 
would they respond to the pres- 
ence of an interloper? Joaz could 
not be sure, and proceeded with 
great caution. 

The cavern rose, fell, widened, 
narrowed. Joaz presently came 
upon evidences of use: small cub- 
icles, hollowed into the walls, lit 
by candelabra holding tall vials 
of luminous stuff. In two of the 
cubicles Joaz came upon sacer- 
dotes, the first asleep on a reed 
rug, the second sitting crosslegged, 
gazing fixedly at a contrivance of 
twisted metal rods. They gave 
Joaz no attention; he continued 
with a more confident step. 

rpHE cave sloped downward, 
widened like a cornucopia 
and suddenly broke into a cavern 
so enormous that Joaz thought 
for a startled instant that he had 



stepped out into the starless 
night. 

The ceiling reached beyond the 
flicker of the myriad lamps, fires 
and glowing vials. Ahead and to 
the left smelters and forges were 
in operation; then a twist in the 
cavern wall obscured something 
of the view. Joaz glimpsed a 
tiered, tubular construction which 
seemed to be some sort of work- 
shop, for a large number of sac- 
erdotes were occupied at com- 
plicated tasks. To the right was 
a stack of bales, a row of bins con- 
taining goods of unknown nature. 

Joaz for the first time saw sac- 
erdote women: neither the 

nymphs nor the half-human 
witches of popular legend. Like 
the men they seemed pallid and 
frail, with sharply defined fea- 
tures; like the man they moved 
with care and deliberation; like 
the men they wore only their 
waist-long hair. There was little 
conversation and no laughter. 
Rather there was an atmosphere 
of not unhappy placidity and con- 
centration. The cavern exuded a 
sense of time, use and custom. 
The stone floor was polished by 
endless padding of bare feet. The 
exhalations of many generations 
had stained the walls. 

No one heeded Joaz. 

He moved slowly forward, 
keeping to the shadows, and 
paused under the stack of bales. 
To the right the cavern dwindled 



50 



GALAXY 



by irregular proportions into a 
vast horizontal funnel, receding, 
twisting, telescoping, losing all 
reality in the dim light. 

Joaz searched the entire sweep 
of vast cavern. Where would be 
the armory, with the weapons 
whose existence the sacerdote, by 
the very act of dying, had prom- 
ised him? Joaz turned his at- 
tention once more to the left, 
straining to see detail in the odd 
tiered workshop which rose fifty 
feet from the stone floor. A 
strange edifice, thought Joaz, 
craning his neck; one whose na- 
ture he could not entirely com- 
prehend. But every aspect of the 
great cavern — so close beside 
Banbeck Vale, and so remote — 
was strange and marvelous. 
Weapons? They might be any- 
where. Certainly he dared seek no 
further for them. 

There was nothing more he 
could learn without risk of dis- 
covery. He turned back the way 
he had come: up the dim passage, 
past the occasional side cubicles, 
where the two sacerdotes re- 
mained as he had found them 
before: the one asleep, the other 
intent on the contrivance of 
twisted metal. He plodded on 
and on. 

Had he come so far? Where 
was the fissure which led to his 
own apartments? Had he passed 
it by, must he search? Panic rose 
in his throat, but he continued, 



watching carefully. There, he had 
not gone wrong. There it opened 
to his right, a fissure almost dear 
and familiar. He plunged into it, 
walked with long loping strides, 
like a man under water, holding 
his luminous tube ahead. 

An apparition rose before him, 
a tall white shape. 

Joaz stood rigid. The gaunt 
figure bore down upon him. Joaz 
pressed against the wall. The 
figure stalked forward, and sud- 
denly shrank to human scale. It 
was the young sacerdote whom 
Joaz had shorn and left for dead. 
He confronted Joaz, mild blue 
eyes bright with reproach and 
contempt. “Give me my tore.” 

VjfTITH numb fingers Joaz 
** removed the golden col- 
lar. The sacerdote took it, but 
made no move to clasp it upon 
himself. He looked at the hair 
which weighed heavy upon Joaz’s 
scalp. With a foolish grimace Joaz 
doffed the disheveled wig, prof- 
fered it. The sacerdote sprang 
back as if Joaz had become a 
cave-goblin. Sidling past, as far 
from Joaz as the wall of the pas- 
sage allowed, he paced swiftly off 
down the tunnel. Joaz dropped 
the wig to the floor, stared down 
at the unkempt pile of hair. He 
turned and looked after the sacer- 
dote, a pallid figure which soon 
became one with the murk. Slow- 
ly Joaz continued up the tunnel. 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



51 



There. An oblong blank of 
light, the opening to his work- 
shop. He crawled through, back 
to the real world. Savagely, with 
all his strength, he thrust the slab 
back in the hole and slammed 
down the gate which originally 
had trapped the sacerdote. 

Joaz’s garments lay where he 
had tossed them. Wrapping him- 
self in a cloak, he went to the 
outer door and looked forth into 
the anteroom, where Rife sat doz- 
ing. Joaz snapped his fingers. 
“Fetch masons, with mortar, 
steel and stone.” 

Joaz bathed with diligence, 
rubbing himself time after time 
with emulsion, rinsing and re- 
rinsing himself. Emerging from 
the bath he took the waiting 
masons into his workshop and 
ordered the sealing of the hole. 

Then he took himself to his 
couch. Sipping a cup of wine, he 
let his mind rove and wander . 

Recollection became reverie. 
Reverie became dream. Joaz once 
again traversed the tunnel, on 
feet light as thistledown, down 
the long cavern, and the sacer- 
dotes in their cubicles now raised 
their heads to look after him. At 
last he stood in the entrance to 
the great underground void, and 
once more looked right and left 
in awe. Now he drifted across 
the floor, past sacerdotes laboring 
earnestly over fires and anvils. 
Sparks rose from retorts, blue 



gas flickered above melting met- 
al. 

Joaz moved beyond to a small 
chamber cut into the stone. Here 
sat an old man, thin as a pole, 
his waist-long mane of hair snow- 
white. The man examined Joaz 
with fathomless blue eyes, and 
spoke, but his voice was muffled, 
inaudible. He spoke again; the 
words rang loud in Joaz’s mind. 

44T BRING you here to caution 
you, lest you do us harm, 
and with no profit to yourself. 
The weapon you seek is both 
non-existent and beyond your 
imagination. Put it outside your 
ambition.” 

By great effort Joaz managed 
to stammer, “The young sacer- 
dote made no denial. This weap- 
on must exist!” 

“Only with the narrow limits 
of special interpretation. The lad 
can speak no more than the lit- 
eral truth, nor can he act with 
other than grace. How can you 
wonder why we hold ourselves 
apart? You Utter folk find purity 
incomprehensible; you thought 
to advantage yourself, but 
achieved nothing but an exercise 
in rat-like stealth. Lest you try 
again with greater boldness I 
must abase myself to set matters 
correct. I assure you, this so- 
called weapon is absolutely be- 
yond your control.” 

First shame, then indignation 



52 



GALAXY 



came over Joaz. He cried out, 
“You do not understand my ur- 
gencies! Why should I act dif- 
ferently? Coralyne is close; the 
Basics are at hand. Are you not 
men? Why will you not help us 
defend the planet?” 

The Demie shook his head, 
and the white hair rippled with 
hypnotic slowness. “I quote you 
the Rationale; passivity, com- 
plete and absolute. This implies 
solitude, sanctity, quiescence, 
peace. Can you imagine the an- 
guish I risk in speaking to you? 
I intervene, I interfere, at vast 
pain of the spirit. Let there be an 
end to it. We have made free 
with your studio, doing you no 
harm, offering you no indignity. 
You have paid a visit to our hall, 
demeaning a noble young man 
in the process. Let us be quits! 
Let there be no further spying on 
either side. Do you agree?” 

Joaz heard his voice respond, 
quite without his conscious 
prompting. It sounded more na- 
sal and shrill than he liked. “You 
offer this agreement now when 
you have learned your fill of my 
secrets, but I know none of 
yours.” 

The Demie’s face seemed to 
recede and quiver. Joaz read con- 
tempt, and in his sleep he tossed 
and twitched. He made an effort 
to speak in a voice of calm rea- 
son: “Come, we are men together. 
Why should we be at odds? Let 



us share our secrets, let each help 
the other. Examine my archives 
at your leisure, and then allow 
me to study this existent but 
non-existent weapon. I swear it 
shall be used, only against the 
Basics, for the protection of both 
of us.” 

The Demie’s eyes sparkled. 
“No.” 

“Why not?” argued Joaz. 
“Surely you wish us no harm?” 

“We are detached and passion- 
less. We await your extinction. 
You are the Utter men, the last 
of humanity. And when you are 
gone, your dark thoughts and 
grim plots will be gone. Murder 
and pain and malice will be 
gone.” 

“I cannot believe this,” said 
Joaz. “There may be no men in 
the cluster, but what of the uni- 
verse? The Old Rule reached far! 
Sooner or later men will return 
to Aerlith.” 

The Demie’s voice became 
plangent. “Do you think we 
speak only from faith? Do you 
doubt our knowledge?” 

“The universe is large. The 
Old Rule reached far.” 

“The last men dwell on Aer- 
lith,” said the Demie. “The Utter 
men and the Sacerdotes. You 
shall pass; we will carry forth 
the Rationale like a banner of 
glory, through all the worlds of 
the sky.” 

“And how will you transport 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



53 



yourselves on this mission?” Joaz 
asked cunningly. “Can you fly to 
the stars as naked as you walk 
the fells?” 

“There will be a means. Time 
is long.” 

“For your purposes, Time 
needs to be long. Even on the 
Coralyne planets there are men. 
Enslaved, reshaped in body and 
mind, but men. What of them? 
It seems that you are wrong, 
that you are guided by faith in- 
deed.” 

T HE Demie fell silent. His 
face seemed to stiffen. 

“Are these not facts?” asked 
Joaz. “How do you reconcile 
them with your faith?” 

The Demie said mildly, “Facts 
can never be reconciled with 
faith. By our faith, these men, if 
they exist, will also pass. Time is 
long. O the worlds of brightness: 
they await us!” 

“It is clear,” said Joaz, “that 
you ally yourselves with the 
Basics and hope for our destruc- 
tion. This can only change our 
attitudes toward you. I fear that 
Ervis Carcolo was right and I 
wrong.” 

“We remain passive,” said the 
Demie. His face wavered, seemed 
to swim with mottled colors. 
“Without emotion, we will stand 
witness to the passing of the Ut- 
ter men, neither helping nor hin- 
dering.” 



Joaz spoke in fury. “Your faith, 
your Rationale — whatever you 
call it — misleads you. I make 
you this threat: if you fail to help 
us, you will suffer as we suffer.” 
“We are passive. We are in- 
different.” 

“What of your children? The 
Basics make no difference be- 
tween us. They will herd you to 
their pens as readily as they do 
us. Why should we fight to pro- 
tect you?” 

The Demie’s face faded, be- 
came splotched with transparent 
mist. His eyes glowed like rotten 
meat. “We need no protection,” 
he howled. “We are secure.” 

“You will suffer our fate,” 
cried Joaz, “I promise you this!” 
The Demie collapsed suddenly 
into a small dry husk, like a dead 
mosquito. With incredible speed, 
Joaz fled back through the caves, 
the tunnels, up through his work- 
room, his studio, into his bed 
chamber where now he jerked 
upright, eyes starting, throat dis- 
tended, mouth dry. 

The door opened; Rife’s head 
appeared. “Did you call, sir?” 
Joaz raised himself on his 
elbows and looked around the 
room. “No. I did not call.” 

Rife withdrew. Joaz settled 
back on the couch, lay staring at 
the ceiling. 

He had dreamed a most pecu- 
liar dream. Dream? A synthesis 
of his own imaginings? Or, in all 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



55 



verity, a confrontation and ex- 
change between two minds? Im- 
possible to decide, and perhaps 
irrelevant. The event carried its 
own conviction. 

Joaz swung his legs over the 
side of the couch and blinked at 
the floor. Dream or colloquy, it 
was all the same. He rose to his 
feet, donned sandals and a robe 
of yellow fur, limped morosely 
up to the Council Room and 
stepped out on a sunny balcony. 

The day was two-thirds over. 
Shadows hung dense along the 
western cliffs. Right and left 
stretched Banbeck Vale. Never 
had it seemed more prosperous or 
more fruitful, and never before 
unreal: as if he were a stranger to 
the planet. He looked north along 
the great bulwark of stone which 
rose sheer to Banbeck Verge. 
This too was unreal, a facade be- 
hind which lived the sacerdotes. 
He gauged the rock face, super- 
imposing a mental projection of 
the great cavern. The cliff toward 
the north end of the vale must 
be scarcely more than a shell! 

Joaz turned his attention to 
the exercise field, where Juggers 
were thudding briskly through 
defensive evolutions. How 
strange was the quality of life, 
which had produced Basic and 
Jugger, sacerdote and himself. He 
thought of Ervis Carcolo, and 
wrestled with sudden exaspera- 
tion. Carcolo was a distraction 



most unwelcome at the present 
time. There would be no toler- 
ance when Carcolo was finally 
brought to account. 

A light step behind him, the 
pressure of fur, the touch of gay 
hands, the scent of incense. Joaz’s 
tensions melted. 

If there were no such creatures 
as minstrel-maidens, it would be 
necessary to invent them. 

r|EEP under Banbeck Scarp, 
in a cubicle lit by a twelve- 
vial candelabra, a naked white- 
haired man sat quietly. On a 
pedestal at the level of his eyes 
rested his tand, an intricate con- 
struction of gold rods and silver 
wire, woven and bent seemingly 
at random. The fortuitousness of 
the design, however, was only ap- 
parent. Each curve symbolized 
an aspect of Final Sentience. The 
shadow cast upon the wall repre- 
sented the Rationale, ever-shift- 
ing, always the same. The object 
was sacred to the sacerdotes, and 
served as a source of revelation. 

There was never an end to the 
study of the tand. New intuitions 
were continually derived from 
some heretofore-overlooked re- 
lationship of angle and curve. 
The nomenclature was elaborate: 
each part, juncture, sweep and 
twist had its name; each aspect 
of the relationships between the 
various parts was likewise cate- 
gorized. Such was the cult of the 



56 



GALAXY 



tand: abstruse, exacting, without 
compromise. At his puberty rites 
the young sacerdote might study 
the original tand for as long as 
he chose. Then each must con- 
struct a duplicate tand, relying 
upon memory alone. Then oc- 
curred the most significant event 
of his lifetime: the viewing of his 
tand by a synod of elders. 

In awesome stillness, for hours 
at a time they would ponder his 
creation, weigh the infinitesimal 
variations of proportion, radius, 
sweep and angle. So they would 
infer the initiate’s quality, judge 
his personal attributes, determine 
his understanding of Final Sen- 
tience, the Rationale and the 
Basis. 

Occasionally the testimony of 
the tand revealed a character so 
tainted as to be reckoned intol- 
erable. The vile tand would be 
cast into a furnace, the molten 
metal consigned to a latrine, the 
unlucky initiate expelled to the 
face of the planet, to live on his 
own terms. 

The naked white-haired Demie, 
contemplating his own beautiful 
tand, sighed, moved restlessly. 
He had been visited by an influ- 
ence so ardent, so passionate, so 
simultaneously cruel and tender, 
that his mind was oppressed. Un- 
bidden, into his mind, came a 
dark seep of doubt. 

Can it be, he asked himself, 
that we have insensibly wandered 



from the true Rationale? Do we 
study our tands with blinded 
eyes? . How to know, oh how 
to know! All is relative ease and 
facility in orthodoxy, yet how can 
it be denied that good is in itself 
undeniable? Absolutes are the 
most uncertain of all formula- 
tions, while the uncertainties are 
the most real . 

Twenty miles over the moun- 
tains, in the long pale light of 
the Aerlith afternoon, Ervis Car- 
colo planned his own plans. “By 
daring, by striking hard, by cut- 
ting deep can I defeat him! In 
resolve, courage and endurance, 
I am more than his equal. Not 
again will he trick me, to slaugh- 
ter my dragons and kill my men! 
Oh, Joaz Banbeck, how I will pay 
you for your deceit!” He raised 
his arms in wrath. “Oh Joaz Ban- 
beck, you whey-faced sheep!” 
Carcolo smote the air with his 
fist. “I will crush you like a clod 
of dry moss!” 

He frowned and rubbed his 
round red chin. But how? Where? 
He had every advantage! Car- 
colo pondered his possible strate- 
gems. “He will expect me to 
strike. So much is certain. Doubt- 
less he will again wait in am- 
bush. So I will patrol every inch, 
but this too he will expect and 
so be wary lest I thunder upon 
him from above. Will he hide be- 
hind Despoire, or along North-

guard, to catch me as I cross the 
Skanse? If so, I must approach 
by another route — through 
Maudlin Pass and under Mount 
Gethron? Then, if he is tardy in 
his march I will meet him on 
Banbeck Verge. And if he is 
early, I stalk him through the 
peaks and chasms . .” 

VIII 

WW7"ITH the cold rain of dawn 
pelting down upon them, 
with the trail illuminated only by 
lightning-glare, Ervis Carcolo, his 
dragons and his men set forth. 
When the first sparkle of sun- 
light struck Mount Despoire, 
they had already traversed 
Maudlin Pass. 

So far, so good, exulted Ervis 
Carcolo. He stood high in his 
stirrups to scan Starbreak Fell. 
No sign of the Banbeck forces. 
He waited, scanning the far edge 
of Northguard Ridge, black 
against the sky. A minute 
passed. Two minutes. The men 
beat their hands together, the 
dragons rumbled and muttered 
fretfully. 

Impatience began to prickle 
along Carcolo’s ribs. He fidgeted 
and cursed. Could not the sim- 
plest of plans be carried through 
without mistake? But now the 
flicker of a heliograph from 
Barch Spike, and another to the 
southeast from the slopes of 



Mount Gethron. Carcolo waved 
forward his army; the way lay 
clear across Starbreak Fell. 
Down from Maudlin Pass surged 
the Happy Valley army: first the 
Long-horned Murderers, steel- 
spiked and crested with steel 
prongs; then the rolling red 
seethe of the Termagants, dart- 
ing their heads as they ran; and, 
behind, the balance of the forces. 

Starbreak Fell spread wide be- 
fore them, a rolling slope strewn 
with flinty meteoric fragments 
which glinted like flowers on the 
gray-green moss. To all sides 
rose majestic peaks, snow blaz- 
ing white in the clear morning 
light: Mount Gethron, Mount 

Despoire, Barch Spike and, far to 
the south, Clew Taw. 

The scouts converged from left 
and right. They brought identical 
reports: no sign of Joaz Banbeck 
or his troops. Carcolo began to 
toy with a new possibility. Per- 
haps Joaz Banbeck had not 
deigned to take the field. The 
idea enraged him and filled him 
with a great joy: if so, Joaz 
would pay dearly for his neglect. 

Halfway across Starbreak Fell 
they came upon a pen occupied 
by two hundred of Joaz Ban- 
beck’s spratling Fiends. Two old 
men and a boy tended the pen, 
and watched the Happy Valley 
horde advance with manifest 
terror. 

But Carcolo rode past leaving 



58 



GALAXY 



t j,e pen unmolested. If he won 
the day, it would become part of 
his spoils. If he lost, the spratling 
Fiends could do him no harm. 

The old men and the boy stood 
on the roof of their turf hut, 
w atching Carcolo and his troops 
pass: the men in black uniforms 
and black peaked caps with back- 
slanting ear-flaps; the dragons 
bounding, crawling, loping, plod- 
ding, according to their kind, 
scales glinting: the dull red and 
maroon of Termagants; the 
poisonous shine of the Blue Hor- 
rors; the black-green Fiends; the 
gray and brown Juggers and 
Murderers. Ervis Carcolo rode 
on the right flank, Bast Givven 
rode to the rear. And now Car- 
colo hastened the pace, haunted 
by the anxiety that Joaz Ban- 
beck might bring his Fiends and 
Juggers up Banbeck Scarp be- 
fore he arrived to thrust him 
back — assuming that Joaz Ban- 
beck had been caught napping. 

But Carcolo reached Banbeck 
Verge without challenge. 

He shouted out in triumph, 
waved his cap high. “Joaz Ban- 
beck the sluggard! Let him try 
now the ascent of Banbeck 
Scarp!” And Ervis Carcolo sur- 
veyed Banbeck Vale with the 
eye of a conqueror. 

T>AST Givven seemed to share 
none of Carcolo’s triumph, 
and kept an uneasy watch to 



north and south and to the rear. 

Carcolo observed him peevish- 
ly from the corner of his eye and 
presently called out, “Ho, ho, 
then! What’s amiss?” 

“Perhaps much. Perhaps noth- 
ing,” said Bast Givven, searching 
the landscape. 

Carcolo blew out his mus- 
taches. Givven went on, in the 
cool voice which so completely 
irritated Carcolo. “Joaz Banbeck 
seems to be tricking us as before.” 
“Why do you say this?” 

“Judge for yourself. Would he 
allow us advantage without 
claiming a miser’s price?” 

“Nonsense!” muttered Carcolo. 
“The sluggard is fat with his last 
victory.” But he rubbed his chin 
and peered uneasily down into 
Banbeck Vale. From here it 
seemed curiously quiet. There 
was a strange inactivity in the 
fields and barracks. A chill began 
to grip Carcolo’s heart — then he 
cried out. “Look at the brooder: 
there are the Banbeck dragons!” 
Givven squinted down into the 
vale, glanced sidewise at Carcolo. 
“Three Termagants, in egg.” He 
straightened, abandoned all 
interest in the vale and scruti- 
nized the peaks and ridges to the 
north and east. “Assume that Joaz 
Banbeck set out before dawn, 
came up to the Verge, by the 
Slickenslides, crossed Blue Fell 
in strength — ” 

“What of Blue Crevasse?” 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



59 



“He avoids Blue Crevasse to 
the north, comes over Barchback, 
steals across the Skanse and 
around Barch Spike . 

Carcolo studied Northguard 
Ridge with new and startled 
awareness. A quiver of move- 
ment, the glint of scales? 

“Retreat!” roared Carcolo. 
“Make for Barch Spike! They’re 
behind us!” 

Startled, his army broke ranks, 
fled across Banbeck Verge, up 
into the harsh spurs of Barch 
Spike. Joaz, his strategy discov- 
ered, launched squads of Mur- 
derers to intercept the Happy 
Valley army, to engage and de- 
lay and, if possible, deny them 
the broken slopes of Barch 
Spike. 

Carcolo calculated swiftly. His 
own Murderers he considered his 
finest troops, and held them in 
great pride. Purposely now he de- 
layed, hoping to engage the Ban- 
beck skirmishers, quickly destroy 
them and still gain the protection 
of the Barch declivities. 

The Banbeck Murderers, how- 
ever, refused to close, and scram- 
bled for height up Barch Spike. 
Carcolo sent forward his Terma- 
gants and Blue Horrors. 

With a horrid snarling the two 
lines met. The Banbeck Terma- 
gants rushed up, to be met by 
Carcolo’s Striding Murderers and 
forced into humping pounding 
flight. 



The main body of Carcolo’s 
troops, excited at the sight of re- 
treating foes, could not be re- 
strained. They veered off from 
Barch Spike, plunged down upon 
Starbreak Fell. The Striding 
Murderers overtook the Banbeck 
Termagants, climbed up their 
backs, toppled them over squeal- 
ing and kicking, then knifed open 
the exposed pink bellies. 

Banbeck’s Long-horned Mur- 
derers came circling, struck from 
the flank into Carcolo’s Striding 
Murderers, goring with steel- 
tipped horns, impaling on lances. 

Somehow they overlooked 
Carcolo’s Blue Horrors who 
sprang down upon them. With 
axes and maces they laid the 
Murderers low, performing the 
rather grisly entertainment of 
clambering on a subdued Mur- 
derer, seizing the horn, stripping 
back horn, skin and scales, from 
head to tail. So Joaz Banbeck 
lost thirty Termagants and per- 
haps two dozen Murderers. Nev- 
ertheless, the attack served its 
purpose, allowing him to bring 
his knights, Fiends and Juggers 
down from Northguard before 
Carcolo could gain the heights 
of Barch Spike. 

Carcolo retreated in a slant- 
wise line up the pocked slopes, 
and meanwhile sent six men 
across the fell to the pen where 
the spratling Fiends milled in 
fear at the battle. The men broke 



60 



GALAXY 



the gates, struck down the two 
old men, herded the young Fiends 
across the fell toward the Ban- 
beck troops. The hysterical sprat- 
lings obeyed their instincts. They 
clasped themselves to the neck 
of whatever dragon they first en- 
countered, which thereupon be- 
came sorely hampered, for its 
own instincts prevented it from 
detaching the spratling by force. 

fT'HIS ruse, a brilliant improvi- 
sation, created enormous 
disorder among the Banbeck 
troops. Ervis Carcolo now 
charged with all his power di- 
rectly into the Banbeck center. 
Two squads of Termagants 
fanned out to harass the men. His 
Murderers — the only category 
in which he outnumbered Joaz 
Banbeck — were sent to engage 
Fiends, while Carcolo’s own 
Fiends, pampered, strong, glisten- 
ing with oily strength, snaked in 
toward the Juggers. Under the 
great brown hulks they darted, 
lashing the fifty-pound steel ball 
at the tip of their tails against 
the inner side of the Jugger’s legs. 

A roaring melee ensued. Bat- 
tle-lines were uncertain. Both 
men and dragons were crushed, 
torn apart, hacked to bits. The 
air sang with bullets, whistled 
with Steel, reverberated to trum- 
peting, whistles, shouts, screams 
and bellows. 

The reckless abandon of Car- 



colo’s tactics achieved results out 
of proportion to his numbers. His 
Fiends burrowed ever deeper 
into the crazed and almost help- 
less Banbeck Juggers, while the 
Carcolo Murderers and Blue 
Horrors held back the Banbeck 
Fiends. Joaz Banbeck himself, 
assailed by Termagants, escaped 
with his life only by fleeing 
around behind the battle, where 
he picked up the support of a 
squad of Blue Horrors. In a fury 
he blew a withdrawal signal, and 
his army backed off down the 
slopes, leaving the ground littered 
with struggling and kicking 
bodies. 

Carcolo, throwing aside all re- 
straint, rose in his saddle and 
signaled to commit his own Jug- 
gers, which so far he had treas- 
ured like his own children. 

Shrilling, hiccuping, they lum- 
bered down into the seethe, tear- 
ing away great mouthfuls of 
flesh to right and left, ripping 
apart lesser dragons with their 
brachs, treading on Termagants, 
seizing Blue Horrors and Mur- 
derers, flinging them wailing and 
clawing through the air. Six Ban- 
beck knights sought to stem the 
charge, firing their muskets point- 
blank into the demoniac faces; 
they went down and were seen 
no more. 

Down on Starbreak Fell tum- 
bled the battle. The nucleus of 
the fighting became less concen-

trated, the Happy Valley advan- 
tage dissipated. Carcolo hesita- 
ted, a long heady instant. 

He and his troops alike were 
afire; the intoxication of unex- 
pected success tingled in their 
brains — but here on Starbreak 
Fell, could they counter the odds 
posed by the greater Banbeck 
forces? Caution dictated that 
Carcolo withdraw up Barch 
Spike, to make the most of his 
limited victory. Already a strong 
platoon of Fiends had grouped 
and were maneuvering to charge 
his meager force of Juggers. Bast 
Givven approached, clearly ex- 
pecting the word to retreat. But 
Carcolo still waited, reveling in 
the havoc being wrought by his 
paltry six Juggers. 

Bast Givven’s saturnine face 
was stern. “Withdraw, withdraw! 
It’s annihilation when their flanks 
bear in on us!” 

Carcolo seized his elboe. 
“Look! See where those Fiends 
gather, see where Joaz Banbeck 
rides! As soon as they charge, 
send six Striding Murderers from 
either side; close in on him, kill 
him!” 

Givven opened his mouth to 
protest, looked where Carcolo 
pointed, rode to obey the orders. 

TTERE came the Banbeck 
Fiends, moving with stealthy 
certainty toward the Happy Val- 
ley Juggers. Joaz, raising in his 



saddle, watched their progress. 
Suddenly from either side the 
Striding Murderers were on him. 
Four of his knights and six 
young cornets, screaming alarm, 
dashed back to protect him; there 
was clanging of steel on steel and 
steel on scale. The Murderers 
fought with sword and mace. The 
knights, their muskets useless, 
countered with cutlasses, one by 
one going under. 

Rearing on hind legs the Mur- 
derer corporal hacked down at 
Joaz, who desperately fended off 
the blow. The Murderer raised 
sword and mace together — and 
from fifty yards a musket pellet 
smashed into its ear. Crazy with 
pain, it dropped its weapons, fell 
forward upon Joaz, writhing and 
kicking. Banbeck Blue Horrors 
came to attack; the Murderers 
darted back and forth over the 
thrashing corporal, stabbing 
down at Joaz, kicking at him, 
finally fleeing the Blue Horrors. 

Ervis Carcolo groaned in dis- 
appointment. By a half-second 
only had he fallen short of vic- 
tory. Joaz Banbeck, bruised, 
mauled, perhaps wounded, had 
escaped with his life. 

Over the crest of the hill came 
a rider: an unarmed youth whip- 
ping a staggering Spider. Bast 
Givven pointed him out to Car- 
colo. “A messenger from the Val- 
ley, in urgency.” 

The lad careened down the fell 



62 



GALAXY 



toward Carcolo, shouting ahead, 
but his message was lost in the 
din of battle. At last he drew 
close. “The Basics, the Basics!” 
Carcolo slumped like a half- 
empty bladder. “Where?” 

“A great black ship, half the 
valley wide. I was up on the 
heath, I managed to escape.” He 
pointed, whimpered. 

“Speak, boy!” husked Carcolo. 
“What do they do?” 

“I did not see; I ran to you.” 
Carcolo gazed across the bat- 
tle-field; the Banbeck Fiends 
had almost reached his Juggers, 
who were backing slowly, with 
heads lowered, fangs fully ex- 
tended. 

Carcolo threw up his hands in 
despair. He ordered Givven, 
“Blow a retreat, break clear!” 
Waving a white kerchief he 
rode around the battle to where 
Joaz Banbeck still lay on the 
ground, the quivering Murderer 
only just now being lifted from 
his legs. Joaz stared up, his face 
white as Carcolo’s kerchief. At 
the sight of Carcolo his eyes 
grew wide and dark, his mouth 
became still. 

Carcolo blurted, “The Basics 
have come once more; they have 
dropped into Happy Valley, they 
are destroying my people.” 

J OAZ Banbeck, assisted by his 
knights, gained his feet. He 
stood swaying, arms limp, look- 



ing silently into Carcolo’s face. 

Carcolo spoke once more. “We 
must call truce. This battle is 
waste! With all our forces let us 
march to Happy Valley and at- 
tack the monsters before they de- 
stroy all of us! Ah, think what we 
could have achieved with the 
weapons of the sacerdotes!” 

Joaz stood silent. Another ten 
seconds passed. Carcolo cried 
angrily, “Come now, what do you 
say?” 

In a hoarse voice Joaz spoke, 
“I say no truce. You rejected my 
warning. You- thought to loot 
Banbeck Vale. I will show you 
no mercy.” 

Carcolo gaped, his mouth a red 
hole under the sweep of his mus- 
taches. “But the Basics — ” 

“Return to your troops. You 
as well as the Basics are my 
enemy. Why should I choose be- 
tween you? Prepare to fight for 
your life; I give you no truce.” 

Carcolo drew back face as pale 
as Joaz’s own. “Never shall you 
rest! Even though you win this 
battle here on Starbreak Fell, yet 
you shall never know victory. I 
will persecute you until you cry. 
for relief.” 

Banbeck motioned to his 
knights. “Whip this dog back to 
his own.” 

Carcolo backed his Spider 
from the threatening flails, 

turned, loped away. 

The tide of battle had turned. 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

The Banbeck Fiends now had 
broken past his Blue Horrors. 
One of his Juggers was gone; an- 
other, facing three sidling Fiends, 
snapped its great jaws, waved its 
monstrous sword. The Fiends 
flicked and feinted with their 
steel balls, scuttled forward. The 
Jugger chopped, shattered its 
sword on the rock-hard armor of 
| the Fiends; they were under- 
neath, slamming their steel balls 
into the monstrous legs. It tried 
to hop clear, toppled majestical- 
l ly. The Fiends slit its belly, and 
now Carcolo had only five Jug- 
gers left. 

“Back!” he cried. “Disengage!” 
l Up Barch Spike toiled his 

troops, the battle-front a roaring 
seethe of scales, armor, flickering 
■ metal. Luckily for Carcolo his 

j rear was to the high ground, and 
I after ten terrible minutes he was 
l| able to establish an orderly re- 
treat. 

Two more Juggers had fallen. 
The three remaining scrambled 
’ free. Seizing boulders, they 

hurled them down into the at- 
{ tackers, who, after a series of 

i sallies and lunges, were well con- 

tent to break clear. In any event 
Joaz, after hearing Carcolo’s 
news, was of no disposition to 
spend further troops. 

Carcolo, waving his sword in 
desperate defiance, led his troops 
back around Barch Spike, pres- 
ently down across the dreary 



Skanse. Joaz turned back to Ban- 
beck Vale. The news of the Basic 
raid had spread to all ears. The 
men rode sober and quiet, look- 
ing behind and overhead. Even 
the dragons seemed infected, and 
muttered restlessly among them- 
selves. 

As they crossed Blue Fell the 
almost omnipresent wind died. 
The stillness added to the op- 
pression. 

Termagants, like the men, be- 
gan to watch the sky. Joaz won- 
dered, how could they know, how 
could they sense the Basics? He 
himself searched the sky, and as 
his army passed down over the 
scarp he thought to see high over 
Mount Gethron, a flitting little 
black rectangle, which presently 
disappeared behind a crag. 

IX 

T^RVIS Carcolo and the rem- 
nants of his army raced pell- 
mell down from the Skanse, 
through the wilderness of ravines 
and gulches at the base of Mount 
Despoire, out on the barrens to 
the west of Happy Valley. All 
pretense of military precision had 
been abandoned. 

Carcolo led the way, his Spider 
sobbing with fatigue. Behind in 
disarray pounded first Murderers 
and Blue Horrors, with Termag- 
ants hurrying along behind. Then 
the Fiends, racing low to the 



i

ground, steel balls grinding on 
rocks, sending up sparks. Far in 
the rear lumbered the Juggers 
and their attendants. 

Down to the verge of Happy 
Valley plunged the army and 
pulled up short, stamping and 
squealing. Carcolo jumped from 
his Spider, ran to the brink, stood 
looking down into the valley. 

He had expected to see the 
ship, yet the actuality of the 
thing was so immediate and in- 
tense as to shock him. It was a 
tapered cylinder, glossy and 
black, resting in a field of le- 
gumes not far from ramshackle 
Happy Town. Polished metal 
disks at either end shimmered 
and glistened with fleeting films 
of color. There were three en- 
trance ports — forward, central 
and aft — and from the central 
port a ramp had been extended 
to the ground. 

The Basics had worked with 
ferocious efficiency. From the 
town straggled a line of people, 
herded by Heavy Troopers. Ap- 
proaching the ship they passed 
through an inspection apparatus 
controlled by a pair of Basics. A 
series of instruments and the eyes 
of the Basics appraised each man, 
woman and child, classified them 
by some system not instantly ob- 
vious, whereupon the captives 
were either hustled up the ramp 
into the ship or prodded into a 
nearby booth. 



Peculiarly, no matter how 
many persons entered, the booth 
never seemed to fill. 

Carcolo rubbed his forehead 
with trembling fingers, turned his 
eyes to the ground. When once 
more he looked up, Bast Givven 
stood beside him, and together 
they stared down into the valley. 

From behind came a cry of 
alarm. Starting around, Carcolo 
saw a black rectangular flyer 
sliding silently down from above 
Mount Gethron. 

Waving his arms Carcolo ran 
for the rocks, bellowing orders to 
take cover. Dragons and men 
scuttled up the gulch. Overhead 
slid the flyer. A hatch opened, 
releasing a load of explosive pel- 
lets. They struck with a great 
rattling volley, and up into the 
air flew pebbles, rock splinters, 
fragments of bone, scales, skin 
and flesh. All who failed to reach 
cover were shredded. 

The Termagants fared rela- 
tively well. The Fiends, though 
battered and scraped, had all sur- 
vived. Two of the Juggers had 
been blinded, and could fight no 
more till they had grown new 
eyes. 

The flyer slid back once more. 
Several of the men fired their 
muskets — an act of apparently 
futile defiance, but the flyer was 
struck and damaged. It twisted, 
veered, soared up in a roaring 
curve, swooped over its back,

plunged toward the mountain- 
side, crashed in a brilliant orange 
gush of fire. Carcolo shouted in 
maniac glee, jumped up and 
down, ran to the verge of the 
cliff, shook his fist at the ship 
below. He quickly quieted, to 
stand glum and shivering. 

Then, turning to the ragged 
cluster of men and dragons who 
once more had crept down from 
the gulch. Carcolo cried hoarsely, 
“What do you say? Shall we 
fight? Shall we charge down 
upon them?” 

HERE was silence. 

Bast Givven replied in a 
colorless voice, “We are help- 
less. We can accomplish nothing. 
Why commit suicide?” 

Carcolo turned away, heart too 
full for words. Givven spoke the 
obvious truth. They would either 
be killed or dragged aboard the 
ship; and then, on a world too 
strange for imagining, be put to 
uses too dismal to be borne. 

Carcolo clenched his fists and 
looked westward with bitter 
hatred. “Joaz Banbeck, you 
brought me to this! When I might 
yet have fought for my people 
you detained me!” 

“The Basics were here al- 
ready,” said Givven with unwel- 
come rationality. “We could have 
done nothing since we had noth- 
ing to do with.” 

“We could have fought!” bel- 



lowed Carcolo. “We might have 
swept down the Crotch and come 
upon them with all force! A hun- 
dred warriors and four hundred 
dragons — are these to be de- 
spised?” 

Bast Givven judged further 
argument to be pointless. He 
pointed. “They now examine our 
brooders.” 

Carcolo turned to look, gave 
a wild laugh. “They are aston- 
ished! They are awed! And well 
have they a right to be.” 

Givven agreed. “I imagine the 
sight of a Fiend or a Blue Hor- 
ror — not to mention a Jugger 
— gives them pause for reflec- 
tion.” 

Down in the valley the grim 
business had ended. The Heavy 
Troopers marched back into the 
ship. A pair of enormous men 
twelve feet high came forth, lifted 
the booth, carried it up the ramp 
into the ship. Carcolo and his 
men watched with protruding 
eyes. “Giants!” 

Bast Givven chuckled dryly. 
“The Basics stare at our Juggers, 
we ponder their Giants.” 

The Basics presently returned 
to the ship. The ramp was drawn 
up, the ports closed. From a tur- 
ret in the bow came a shaft of 
energy, touching each of the 
three brooders in succession, and 
each exploded with great erup- 
tion of black bricks. 

Carcolo moaned softly under 




68 



GALAXY 



his breath, but said nothing. 

The ship trembled, floated. 
Carcolo bellowed an order; men 
and dragons rushed for cover. 
Flattened behind boulders they 
watched the black cylinder rise 
from the valley, drift to the west. 
“They make for Banbeck Vale,” 
said Bast Givven. 

Carcolo laughed, a cackle of 
mirthless glee. Bast Givven 
looked at him sidelong. Had Er- 
vis Carcolo become addled? He 
turned away. A matter of no 
great moment. 

Carcolo came to a sudden re- 
solve. He stalked to one of the 
Spiders, mounted, swung around 
to face his men. “I ride to Ban- 
beck Vale. Joaz Banbeck has 
done his best to despoil me; I 
shall do my best against him. I 
give no orders: come or stay as 
you wish. Only remember! Joaz 
Banbeck would not allow us to 
fight the Basics!” 

He rode off. The men stared 
into the plundered valley, turned 
to look after Carcolo. The black 
ship was just now slipping over 
Mount Despoire. There was 
nothing for them in the valley. 
Grumbling and muttering, they 
summoned the bone-tired drag- 
ons and set off up the dreary 
mountainside. 

T^RVIS Carcolo rode his Spider 
at a plunging run across the 
Skanse. Tremendous crags soared 



to either side, the blazing sun 
hung halfway up the black sky. 
Behind, the Skanse Ramparts; 
ahead, Barchback, Barch Spike 
and Northguard Ridge. 

Oblivious to the fatigue of his 
Spider, Carcolo whipped it on. 
Gray-green moss pounded back 
from its wild feet, the narrow 
head hung low, foam trailed from 
its gill-vents. Carcolo cared noth- 
ing. His mind was empty of all 
but hate — for the Basics, for 
Joaz Banbeck, for Aerlith, for 
man, for human history. 

Approaching Northguard the 
Spider staggered and fell. It lay 
moaning, neck outstretched, legs 
trailing back. Carcolo dismounted 
in disgust. He looked back down 
the long rolling slope of the 
Skanse to see how many of his 
troops had followed him. A man 
riding a Spider at a modest lope 
turned out to be Bast Givven, 
who presently came up beside 
him and inspected the fallen 
Spider. “Loosen the surcingle. He 
will recover the sooner.” Carcolo 
glared, thinking to hear a new 
note in Giwen’s voice. Neverthe- 
less he bent over the foundered 
dragon and slipped loose the 
broad bronze buckle. Givven dis- 
mounted, stretched his arms, 
massaged his thin legs. He 
pointed. “The Basic ship de- 
scends into Banbeck Vale.” 

Carcolo nodded grimly. “I 
would be an audience to the land- 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



69 



ing.” He kicked the Spider. 
“Come, get up, have you not 
rested enough? Do you wish me 
to walk?” 

The Spider whimpered its fa- 
tigue, but nevertheless struggled 
to its feet. Carcolo started to 
mount, but Bast Givven laid a re- 
straining hand on his shoulder. 
Carcolo looked back in outrage: 
here was impertinence! Givven 
said calmly, “Tighten the surcin- 
gle, otherwise you will fall on 
the rocks and once more break 
your bones.” 

Uttering a spiteful phrase un- 
der his breath, Carcolo clasped 
the buckle back into position. 
The Spider cried out in despair. 
Paying no heed, Carcolo 
mounted, and the Spider moved 
off with trembling steps. 

Barch Spike rose ahead like the 
prow of a white ship, dividing 
Northguard Ridge from Barch- 
back. Carcolo paused to consider 
the landscape, tugging his mus- 
taches. 

pIWEN was tactfully silent. 

Carcolo looked back down 
the Skanse to the listless straggle 
of his army, then set off to the 
left. 

Passing close under Mount 
Gethron, skirting the High Jam- 
bles, they descended an ancient 
water-course to Banbeck Verge. 
Though perforce they had come 
without great speed, the Basic 



ship had moved no faster. It had 
only started to settle into the 
vale, the disks at bow and stern 
swirling with furious colors. 

Carcolo grunted bitterly. 
“Trust Joaz Banbeck to scratch 
his own itch. Not a soul in sight! 
He’s taken to his tunnels, drag- 
ons and all.” Pursing his mouth 
he rendered a mincing parody of 
Joaz’s voice: “ ‘Ervis Carcolo, my 
dear friend, there is but one an- 
swer to attack: dig tunnels!’ And 
I replied to him, ‘Am I a sacer- 
dote to live underground? Bur- 
row and delve, Joaz Banbeck, do 
as you will. I am but an old-time 
man; I go under the cliffs only 
when I must.’ ” 

Givven gave the faintest of 
shrugs. 

Carcolo went on, “Tunnels or 
not, they’ll winkle him out. If 
need be they’ll blast open the en- 
tire valley. They’ve no lack of 
tricks.” 

Givven grinned sardonically. 
“Joaz Banbeck knows a trick or 
two — as we know to our sorrow.” 

“Let him capture two dozen 
Basics today,” snapped Carcolo. 
“Then I’ll concede him a clever 
man.” He stalked away to the 
very brink of the cliff, standing 
in full view of the Basic ship. 
Givven watched without expres- 
sion. 

Carcolo pointed. “Aha! Look 
there!” 

“Not I,” said Givven. “I re- 



70 



GALAXY 



spect the Basic weapons too 
greatly.” 

“Pah!” spat Carcolo. Neverthe- 
less he moved a trifle back from 
the brink. “There are dragons in 
Kergan’s Way. For all Joaz Ban- 
beck’s talk of tunnels.” He gazed 
north along the valley a moment 
or two, then threw up his hands 
in frustration. “Joaz Banbeck will 
not come up here to me. There 
is nothing I can do. Unless I 
walk down into the village, seek 
him out and strike him down, he 
will escape me.” 

“Unless the Basics captured 
the two of you and confined you 
in the same pen,” said Givven. 

“Bah!” muttered Carcolo, and 
moved off to one side.

Banbeck Vale for the first time 
were being put to practical use. 

He had evolved the scheme 
while playing with a set of old 
lenses, and dismissed it as quick- 
ly. Then one day, while trading 
with the sacerdotes in the cavern 
under Mount Gethron, he had 
proposed that they design and 
supply the optics for such a sys- 
tem. 

The blind old sacerdote who 
conducted the trading gave an 
ambiguous reply. The possibility 



of such a project, under certain 
circumstances, might well de- 
serve consideration. Three 
months passed. The scheme re- 
ceded to the back of Joaz Ban- 
beck’s mind. Then the sacerdote 
in the trading-cave inquired if 
Joaz still planned to install the 
viewing system. If so he might 
take immediate delivery of the 
optics. 

Joaz agreed to the barter price, 
returned to Banbeck Vale with 
four heavy crates. He ordered the 
necessary tunnels driven, in- 
stalled the lenses, and found that 
with the study darkened he could 
command all quarters of Banbeck 
Vale. 

Now, with the Basic ship dark- 
ening the sky, Joaz Banbeck 
stood in his study, watching the 
descent of the great black hulk. 

At the back of the chamber 
maroon portieres parted. Clutch- 
ing the cloth with taut fingers 
stood the minstrel-maiden Phade. 
Her face was pale, her eyes 
bright as opals. In a husky voice 
she called, “The ship of death. 
It has come to gather souls!” 

Joaz turned her a stony glance 
and turned back to the honed- 
glass screen. “The ship is clearly 
visible.” 

Phade ran forward, clasped 
Joaz’s arm, swung around to look 
into his face. “Let us try to es- 
cape into the High Jambles. 
Don’t let them take us so soon!” 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

“No one deters you,” said Joaz 
indifferently. “Escape in any di- 
rection you choose.” 

Phade stared at him blankly, 
then turned her head and 
watched the screen. The great 
black ship sank with sinister de- 
liberation, the disks at bow and 
stern now shimmering mother-of- 
pearl. Phade looked back to Joaz, 
licked her lips. “Are you not 
afraid?” 

Joaz smiled thinly. “What 
good to run? Their Trackers are 
swifter than Murderers, more 
vicious than Termagants. They 
can smell you a mile away, take 
you from the very center of the 
Jambles.” 

Phade shivered with super- 
stitious horror. She whispered, 
“Let them take me dead, then. 
I can’t go with them alive.” 

Joaz suddenly cursed. “Look 
where they land! In our best field 
of bellegarde!” 

“What is the difference? 

“ ‘Difference’? Must we stop 
eating because they pay their 
visit?” 

T)HADE looked at him in a 
daze, beyond comprehen- 
sion. She sank slowly to her 
knees and began to perform the 
ritual gestures of the Theurgic 
cult. Hands palm down to either 
side, slowly up till the back of 
the hand touched the ears, and 
the simultaneous protrusion of 

72 



the tongue; over and over again, 
eyes staring with hypnotic inten- 
sity into emptiness. 

Joaz ignored the gesticulations, 
until Phade, her face screwed up 
into a fantastic mask, began to 
sigh and whimper. Then he 
swung the flaps of his jacket 
into her face. “Give over your 
folly!” 

Phade collapsed moaning to 
the floor. Joaz’s lips twitched in 
annoyance. Impatiently he 
hoisted her erect. “Look you, 
these Basics are neither ghouls 
nor angels of death. They are no 
more than pallid Termagants, the 
basic stock of our dragons. So 
now, give over your idiocy, or 
I’ll have Rife take you away.” 
“Why do you not make ready? 
You watch and do nothing.” 
“There is nothing more that I 
can do.” 

Phade drew a deep shuddering 
sigh, stared dully at the screen. 
“Will you fight them?” 
“Naturally.” 

“How can you hope to counter 
such miraculous power?” 

“We will do what we can. They 
have not yet met our dragons.” 
The ship came to rest in a 
purple and green vine-field across 
the valley, near the mouth of 
Clybourne Crevasse. The port 
slid back and a ramp rolled forth. 
“Look,” said Joaz, “there you see 
them.” 

Phade stared at the queer pale 
GALAXY 






shapes who had come tentatively 
out on the ramp. “They seem 
strange and twisted, like silver 
puzzles for children.” 

“They are the Basics. From 
their eggs came our dragons. 
They have done as well with 
men: look, here are their Heavy 
Troops.” 

Down the ramp, four abreast, 
in exact cadence, marched the 
Heavy Troops, to halt fifty yards 
in front of the ship. There were 
three squads of twenty: short 

squat men with massive shoul- 
ders, thick necks and stern, down- 
drawn faces. They wore armor 
fashioned from overlapping 
scales of black and blue metal, 
a wide belt slung with pistol and 
sword. Black epaulets, extending 
past their shoulders, supported a 
short ceremonial flap of black 
cloth ranging down their backs. 
Their helmets bore a crest of 
sharp spikes. Their knee-high 
boots were armed with kick- 
knives. 

A number of Basics now rode 
forth. Their mounts were crea- 
tures only remotely resembling 
men. They ran on hands and feet, 
backs high off the ground. Their 
heads were long and hairless, 
with quivering loose lips. The 
Basics controlled them with neg- 
ligent touches of a quirt, and 
once on the ground set them can- 
tering smartly through the belle- 
garde. Meanwhile a team of 



Heavy Troopers rolled a three- 
wheeled mechanism down the 
ramp, directed its complex snout 
toward the village. 

“Never before have they pre- 
pared so carefully,” muttered 
Joaz. “Here come the Trackers.” 
He counted. “Only two dozen? 
Perhaps they are hard to breed. 
Generations pass slowly with 
men; dragons lay a clutch of eggs 
every year . 

r I ''HE Trackers moved to the 
side and stood in a loose rest- 
less group: gaunt creatures seven 
feet tall, with bulging black eyes, 
beaked noses, small undershot 
mouths pursed as if for kissing. 
From narrow shoulders long 
arms dangled and swung like 
ropes. As they waited they flexed 
their knees, staring sharply up 
and down the valley, in constant 
restless motion. After them came 
a group of Weaponeers — un- 
modified men wearing loose 
cloth smocks and cloth hats of 
green and yellow. They brought 
with them two more three- 
wheeled contrivances which they 
at once began to adjust and test. 

The entire group became still 
and tense. 

The Heavy Troopers stepped 
forward with a stumping, heavy- 
legged gait, hands ready at pis- 
tols and swords. “Here they 
come,” said Joaz. Phade made a 
quiet desperate sound, knelt and 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

once more began to perform 
Theurgic gesticulations. Joaz in 
disgust ordered her from the 
study. He went to a panel 
equipped with a bank of six di- 
rect-wire communications, the 
construction of which he had per- 
sonally supervised. He spoke in- 
to three of the telephones, assur- 
ing himself that his defenses were 
alert, then returned the honed 
glass screens. 

Across the field of bellegarde 
came the Heavy Troopers, faces 
heavy, hard, marked with down- 
veering creases. Upon either 
flank the Weaponeers trundled 
their three-wheeled mechanisms, 
but the Trackers waited beside 
the ship. About a dozen Basics 
rode behind the Heavy Troopers, 
carrying bulbous weapons on 
their backs. 

A hundred yards from the por- 
tal into Kergan’s Way, beyond 
the range of the Banbeck mus- 
kets, the invaders halted. A 
Heavy Trooper ran to one of the 
Weaponeers’ carts, thrust his 
!; shoulders under a harness and 
stood erect. He now carried a 
gray machine, from which ex- 
tended a pair of black globes. 
The Trooper scuttled toward the 
village like an enormous rat, 
while from the black globes 
streamed a flux, intended to in- 
terfere with the neural currents 
of the Banbeck defenders, and 
so immobilize them. 



Explosions sounded. Puffs of 
smoke appeared from nooks and 
vantages through the crags. Bul- 
lets spat into the ground beside 
the Trooper. Several caromed off 
his armor. 

At once heat-beams from the 
ship stabbed against the cliff 
walls. In his -study Joaz Ban- 
beck smiled. The smoke puffs 
were decoys. The actual shots 
came from other areas. The 
Trooper, dodging and jerking, 
avoided a rain of bullets and ran 
under the portal, above which 
two men waited. Affected by the 
flux, they tottered, stiffened, but 
nevertheless dropped a great 
stone which struck the Trooper 
where the neck joined his 
shoulders and hurled him to the 
ground. 

He thrashed his arms and legs 
up and down, rolled over and 
over. Then, bouncing to his feet, 
he raced back into the valley, 
soaring and bounding, finally to 
stumble, plunge headlong to the 
ground and lay kicking and quiv- 
ering. 

The Basic army watched with 
no apparent concern or interest. 

T | ''HERE was a moment of in- 
activity. Then from the 
ship came an invisible field of 
vibration, traveling across the 
face of the cliff. 

Where the focus struck, puffs 
of dust arose and loose rock be- 



74 



GALAXY 



came dislodged. A man, lying on 
a ledge, sprang to his feet, danc- 
ing and twisting, plunged two 
hundred feet to his death. Pass- 
ing across one of Joaz Banbeck’s 
spy-holes, the vibration was 
carried into the study where it 
set up a nerve-grinding howl. The 
vibration passed along the cliff. 
Joaz rubbed his aching head. 

Meanwhile the Weaponeers 
discharged one of their instru- 
ments. First there came a 
muffled explosion, then through 
the air curved a wobbling gray 
sphere. Inaccurately aimed, it 
struck the cliff and burst in a 
great gush of yellow-white gas. 
The mechanism exploded once 
more, and this time lobbed the 
bomb accurately into Kergan’s 
Way — which was now deserted. 
The bomb produced no effect. 

In his study Joaz waited grim- 
ly. To now the Basics had taken 
only tentative, almost playful, 
steps. More serious efforts would 
surely follow. 

Wind dispersed the gas; the 
situation remained as before. The 
casualties so far had been one 
Heavy Trooper and one Ban- 
beck rifleman. 

From the ship now came a 
stab of red flame, harsh, decisive. 
The rock at the portal shattered. 
Slivers sang and spun; the Heavy 
Troopers jogged forward. 

Joaz spoke into his telephone, 
bidding his captains caution, lest 



in counter-attacking against a 
feint they expose themselves to 
a new gas bomb. 

But the Heavy Troopers 
stormed into Kergan’s Way — 
in Joaz’s mind an act of con- 
temptuous recklessness. He gave 
a curt order. 

Out from passages and areas 
swarmed his dragons: Blue Hor- 
rors, Fiends, Termagants. 

The squat Troopers stared 
with sagging jaws. Here were un- 
expected antagonists! Kergan’s 
Way resounded with their calls 
and orders. First they fell back, 
then, with the courage of desper- 
ation, fought furiously. Up and 
down Kergan’s Way raged the 
battle. 

Certain relationships quickly 
became evident In the narrow 
defile neither the Trooper pistols 
nor the steel-weighted tails of the 
Fiends could be used effectively. 
Cutlasses were useless against 
dragon-scale, but the pincers of 
the Blue Horrors, the Termagant 
daggers, the axes, swords, fangs 
and claws of the Fiends, did 
bloody work against the Heavy 
Troopers. A single Trooper and 
a single Termagant were approx- 
imately a match; though the 
Trooper, gripping the dragon 
with massive arms, tearing away 
its brachs, breaking back its neck, 
won more often than the Terma- 
gant. But if two or three Terma- 
gants confronted a single Troop- 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



75 



er, he was doomed. As soon as he 
committed himself to one, an- 
other would crush his legs, blind 
him or hack open his throat. 

So the Troopers fell back to 
the valley floor, leaving twenty 
of their fellows dead in Kergan’s 
Way. The Banbeck men once 
more opened fire, but once more 
with minor effect. 

J OAZ watched from his study, 
wondering as to the next 
Basic tactic. Enlightenment was 
not long in coming. The Heavy 
Troopers regrouped and stood 
panting, while the Basics rode 
back and forth receiving informa- 
tion, admonishing, advising, chid- 
ing. 

From the black ship came a 
gush of energy, to strike the cliff 
above Kergan’s Way. The study 
rocked with the concussion. 

Joaz backed away from the 
vision-plates. What if a ray 
struck one of his collecting 
lenses? Might not the energy be 
guided and reflected directly 
toward him? 

He departed his study as it 
shook to a new explosion. 

He ran through a passage, de- 
scended a staircase, emerged into 
one of the central galleries, to 
find apparent confusion. White- 
faced women and children, retir- 
ing deeper into the mountain, 
pushed past dragons and men in 
battle-gear entering one of the 



new tunnels. Joaz watched for a 
moment or two to satisfy himself 
that the confusion held no panic, 
then joined his warriors in the 
tunnel leading north. 

In some past era an entire 
section of the cliff at the head of 
the valley had sloughed off. 
creating a jungle of piled rock 
and boulders: the Banbeck Jam- 
bles. Here, through a fissure, the 
new tunnel opened; and here 
Joaz went with his warriors. Be- 
hind them, down the valley, 
sounded the rumble of explosions 
as the black ship began to demol- 
ish Banbeck Village. 

Joaz, peering around a boul- 
der, watched in a fury, as great 
slabs of rock began to scale away 
from the cliff. 

Then he stared in astonish- 
ment, for to the Basic troops had 
come an extraordinary reinforce- 
ment: eight Giants twice an or- 
dinary man’s stature — barrel- 
chested monsters, gnarled of arm 
and legs, with pale eyes, shocks 
of tawny hair. They wore brown 
and red armor with black epau- 
lettes, and carried swords, maces 
and blast-cannon slung over 
their backs. 

Joaz considered. The presence 
of the Giants gave him no reason 
to alter his central strategy, 
which in any event was vague 
and intuitive. He must be pre- 
pared to suffer losses, and could 
only hope to inflict greater losses 



76

Basic on mount;

I, 



on the Basics. But what did they 
care for the lives of their troops? 
Less than he cared for his drag- 
ons. And if they destroyed Ban- 
beck Village, ruined the Vale, 
how could he do corresponding 
damage to them? 

He looked over his shoulder at 
the tall white cliffs, wondering 
how closely he had estimated the 
position of the sacerdote’s hall. 
And now he must act; the time 
had come. 

He signaled to a small boy, one 
of his own sons, who took a deep 
breath, hurled himself blindly 
away from the shelter of the 
rocks, ran helter-skelter out to 
the valley floor. A moment later 
his mother ran forth to snatch 
him up and dash back into the 
Jambles. 

“Done well,” Joaz commended 
them. “Done well indeed.” Cau- 
tiously he again looked forth 
through the rocks. The Basics 
were gazing intently in his di- 
rection. 

R a long moment, while Joaz 
tingled with suspense, it 
seemed that they had ignored his 
ploy. They conferred, came to a 
decision, flicked the leathery but- 
tocks of their mounts with their 
quirts. The creatures pranced 
sidewise, then loped north up the 
valley. The Trackers fell in be- 
hind, then came the Heavy 
Troopers moving at a humping 



quick-step. The Weaponeers fol- 
lowed with their three-wheeled 
mechanisms, and ponderously at 
the rear came the eight Giants. 

Across the fields of bellegarde 
and vetch, over vines, hedges, 
beds of berries and stands of oil- 
pod tramped the raiders, destroy- 
ing with a certain morose satis- 
faction. 

The Basics prudently halted 
before the Banbeck Jambles, 
while the Trackers ran ahead like 
dogs, clambering over the first 
boulders, rearing high to test the 
air for odor, peering, listening, 
pointing, twittering doubtfully to 
each other. The Heavy Troopers 
moved in carefully, and their 
near presence spurred on the 
Trackers. 

Abandoning caution, they 
bounded into the heart of the 
Jambles, emitting squeals of hor- 
rified consternation when a dozen 
Blue Horrors dropped among 
them. They clawed out heat-guns, 
in their excitement burning 
friend and foe alike. With silken 
ferocity the Blue Horrors ripped 
them apart. Screaming for aid, 
kicking, flailing, thrashing, those 
who were able fled as precipit- 
ously as they had come. 

Only twelve from the original 
twenty-four regained the valley 
floor; and even as they did so, 
even as they cried out in relief at 
winning free from death, a squad 
of Long-homed Murderers burst 




78 



GALAXY 



out upon them, and these surviv- 
ing Trackers were knocked down, 
gored, hacked. 

The Heavy Troopers charged 
forward with hoarse calls of rage, 
aiming pistols, swinging swords; 
but the Murderers retreated to 
the shelter of the boulders. 

Within the Jambles the Ban- 
beck men had appropriated the 
heat-guns dropped by the Track- 
ers. Warily coming forward, they 
tried to burn the Basics. But, un- 
familiar with the weapons, the 
men neglected either to focus or 
condense the flame. The Basics 
were no more than mildly singed. 
Hastily they whipped their 
mounts back out of range. The 
Heavy Troopers, halting not a 
hundred feet in front of the Jam- 
bles, sent in a volley of explosive 
pellets, which killed two of the 
Banbeck knights aijd forced the 
others back. 

XI 

AT A discreet distance the 
Basics appraised the situa- 
tion. The Weaponeers came up 
and, while awaiting instructions, 
conferred in low tones with the 
mounts. 

One of these Weaponeers was 
now summoned and given orders. 
He divested himself of all his 
weapons and holding his empty 
hands in the air marched forward 
to the edge of the Jambles. 



Choosing a gap between a pair of 
ten-foot boulders, he resolutely 
entered the rock-maze. 

A Banbeck knight escorted 
him to Joaz. Here, by chance, 
were also half a dozen Terma- 
gants. The Weaponeer paused 
uncertainly, made a mental read- 
justment, approached the Ter- 
magants. Bowing respectfully he 
started to speak. The Termag- 
ants listened without interest, 
and presently one of the knights 
directed him to Joaz. 

“Dragons do not rule men on 
Aerlith,” said Joaz dryly. “What 
is your message?” 

The Weaponeer looked dubi- 
ously toward the Termagants, 
then somberly back to Joaz. 
“You are authorized to act for 
the entire warren?” He spoke 
slowly in a dry bland voice, se- 
lecting his words with conscien- 
tious care. 

Joaz repeated shortly, “What 
is your message?” 

“I bring an integration from 
my masters.” 

“ ‘Integration’? I do not under- 
stand you.” 

“An integration of the instan- 
taneous vectors of destiny. An 
interpretation of the future. They 
wish the sense conveyed to you 
in the following terms: ‘Do not 
waste lives, both ours and your 
own. You are valuable to us 
and will be given treatment in 
accordance with this value. 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



79 



Surrender to the Rule. Cease the 
wasteful destruction of enter- 
prise. 

Joaz frowned. “Destruction of 
‘enterprise’?” 

“The reference is to the con- 
tent of your genes. The message 
is at its end. I advise you to 
accede. Why waste your blood, 
why destroy yourselves? Come 
forth now with me. All will be 
for the best.” 

Joaz gave a brittle laugh. “You 
are a slave. How can you judge 
what is best for us?” 

The Weaponeer blinked. 
“What choice is there for you? 
All residual pockets of disorgan- 
ized life are to be expunged. The 
way of facility is best.” He in- 
clined his head respectfully 
toward the Termagants. “If you 
doubt me, consult your own 
Revered Ones. They will advise 
you.” 

“There are no Revered Ones 
here,” said Joaz. “The dragons 
fight with us and for us; they 
are our fellow-warriors. But I 
have an alternate proposal. Why 
do not you and your fellows join 
us? Throw off your slavery, be- 
come free men! We will take the 
ship and go searching for the old 
worlds of men.” 

The Weaponeer exhibited only 
polite interest. “ ‘Worlds of men’? 
There are none of them. A few 
residuals such as yourself remain 
in the desolate regions. All are 



to be expunged. Would you not 
prefer to serve the Rule?” 

“Would you not prefer to be 
a free man?” 

The Weaponeer’s face showed 
mild bewilderment. “You do not 
understand me. If you choose — ” 
“Listen carefully,” said Joaz. 
“You and your fellows can be 
your own masters, live among 
other men.” 

The Weaponeer frowned. 
“Who would wish to be a wild 
savage? To whom would we look 
for law, control, direction, order?” 

J OAZ threw up his hands in dis- 
gust, but made one last at- 
tempt. “I will provide all these; I 
will undertake such a responsibil- 
ity. Go back, kill all the Basics — 
the Revered Ones, as you call 
them. These are my first orders.” 
“Kill them?” The Weaponeer’s 
voice was soft with horror. 

“Kill them.” Joaz spoke as if 
to a child. “Then we men will 
possess the ship. We will go to 
find the worlds where men are 
powerful — ” 

“There are no such worlds.” 
“Ah, but there must be! At one 
time men roamed every star in 
the sky.” 

“No longer.” 

“What of Eden?” 

“I know nothing of it.” 

Joaz threw up his hands. “Will 
you join us?” 

“What would be the meaning 



80 



GALAXY 



of such an act?” said the Weapon- 
eer gently. “Come then. Lay 
down your arms, submit to the 
Rule.” He glanced doubtfully 
toward the Termagants. “Your 
own Revered Ones will receive 
fitting treatment. Have no fear 
on this account.” 

“You fool! These ‘Revered 
Ones’ are slaves, just as you are 
a slave to the Basics! We breed 
them to serve us, just as you are 
bred! Have at least the grace to 
recognize your own degradation!” 
The Weaponeer blinked. “You 
speak in terms I do not com- 
pletely understand. You will not 
surrender then?” 

“No. We will kill all of you, if 
our strength holds out.” 

The Weaponeer bowed, turned, 
departed through the rocks. Joaz 
followed, peered out over the val- 
ley floor. 

The Weaponeer made his re- 
port to the Basics, who listened 
with characteristic detachment. 
They gave an order, and the 
Heavy Troopers, spreading out 
in a skirmish line, moved slowly 
in toward the rocks. 

Behind lumbered the Giants, 
blasters slung forward at the 
ready, and about twenty Track- 
ers, survivors of the first foray. 
The Heavy Troopers reached the 
rocks, peered in. The Trackers 
clambered above, searching for 
ambushes, and finding none, 
signaled back. With great caution 



the Heavy Troopers entered the 
Jambles, necessarily breaking 
formation. Twenty feet they ad- 
vanced, fifty feet, a hundred feet. 
Emboldened, the vengeful Track- 
ers sprang forward over the rocks 
. and up surged the Termag- 
ants. 

Screaming and cursing the 
Trackers scrambled back, pur- 
sued by the dragons. The Heavy 
Troopers recoiled, then swung 
up their weapons, fired. Two Ter- 
magants were struck under the 
lower armpits, their most vulner- 
able spot. Floundering, they 
tumbled down among the rocks. 
Others, maddened, jumped 
squarely down upon the Troop- 
ers. There was roaring, squealing, 
cries of shock and pain. The 
Giants lumbered up, and grin- 
ning vastly plucked away the 
Termagants, wrenched off their 
heads, flung them high over the 
rocks. Those Termagants who 
were able scuttled back, leaving 
half a dozen Heavy Troopers 
wounded, two with their throats 
torn open. 

A GAIN the Heavy Troopers 
moved forward, with the 
Trackers reconnoitering above, 
but more warily. The Trackers 
froze, yelled a warning. The 
Heavy Troopers stopped short, 
calling to each other, swinging 
their guns nervously. Overhead 
the Trackers scrambled back, 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



81 



and through the rocks, over the 
rocks, came dozens of Fiends and 
Blue Horrors. 

The Heavy Troopers, grimac- 
ing dourly, fired their pistols; and 
the air reeked with the stench of 
burning scale, exploded viscera. 
The dragons surged in upon the 
men, and now began a terrible 
battle among the rocks, with the 
pistols, the maces, even the 
swords useless for lack of room. 

The Giants lumbered forward 
and in turn were attacked by 
Fiends. Astonished, the idiotic 
grins faded from their faces; they 
hopped awkwardly back from 
the steel-weighted tails, but 
among the rocks the Fiends were 
also at a disadvantage, their steel 
balls clattering and jarring away 
from rock more often than flesh. 

The Giants, recovering, dis- 
charged their chest-projectors in- 
to the melee. Fiends were torn 
apart as well as Blue Horrors and 
Heavy Troopers, the Giants 
making no distinction. 

Over the rocks came another 
wave of dragons: Blue Horrors. 
They slid down on the heads of 
the Giants, clawing, stabbing, 
tearing. In a frenzy the Giants 
tore at the creatures, flung them 
to the ground, stamped on them, 
and the Heavy Troopers burnt 
them with their pistols. 

From nowhere, for no reason, 
there came a lull. 

Ten seconds, fifteen seconds 



passed, with no sound but whim- 
pering and moaning from 
wounded dragons and men. A 
sense of imminence weighted the 
air, and here came the Juggers, 
looming through the passages. 

For a brief period Giants and 
Juggers looked each other face 
to face. Then Giants groped for 
their blast-projectors, while Blue 
Horrors sprang down once more, 
grappling the Giant arms. The 
Juggers stumped quickly for- 
ward. Dragon-brachs grappled 
Giant arms; bludgeons and 
maces swung, dragon armor and 
man armor crushed and ground 
apart. Man and dragon tumbled 
over and over, ignoring pain, 
shock, mutilation. 

The struggle became quiet. 
Sobbing and wheezing replaced 
the roars, and presently eight 
Juggers, superior in mass and 
natural armament, staggered a- 
way from eight destroyed Giants. 

The Troopers meanwhile had 
drawn together, standing back to 
back in clots. Step by step, burn- 
ing with heat-beams the scream- 
ing Horrors, Termagants and 
Fiends who lunged after them, 
they retreated toward the valley 
floor, and finally won free of the 
rocks. The pursuing Fiends, anx- 
ious to fight in the open, sprang 
into their midst, while from the 
flanks came Long-horned Mur- 
derers and Striding Murderers. 
In a spirit of reckless jubilation,

a dozen men riding Spiders, 
carrying blast-cannon taken from 
the fallen Giants, charged the 
Basics and Weaponeers, who 
waited beside the rather casual 
emplacement of three-wheeled 
weapons. The Basics, without 
shame, jerked their man-mounts 
around and fled toward the black 
ship. 

The Weaponeers swiveled 
their mechanisms, aimed, dis- 
charged bursts of energy. One 
man fell, two men, three men — 
then the others were among the 
Weaponeers, who were soon 
hacked to pieces . including the 
persuasive individual who had 
served as envoy. 

Several of the men, whooping 
and hooting, set out in chase of 
the Basics. But the human 
mounts, springing along like mon- 
strous rabbits, carried the Basics 
as fast as the Spiders carried the 
men. 

From the Jambles came a horn 
signal. The mounted men halted, 
wheeled back; the entire Ban- 
beck force turned and retreated 
full speed into the Jambles. 

The Troopers stumbled a few 
defiant steps in pursuit, then 
halted in sheer fatigue. 

Of the original three squads, 
not enough men to make up a 
single squad survived. The eight 
Giants had perished, all Weapon- 
eers and almost the entire group 
of Trackers. 



The Banbeck forces gained the 
Jambles with seconds only to 
spare. From the black ship came 
a volley of explosive pellets, to 
shatter the rocks at the spot 
where they had disappeared. 

/"'kN A wind-polished cape of 
" rock above Banbeck Vale 
Ervis Carcolo and Bast Givven 
had watched the battle. 

The rocks hid the greater part 
of the fighting. The cries and 
clangor rose faint and tinny, like 
insect noise. There would be the 
glint of dragon scale, glimpses of 
running men, the shadow and 
flicker of movement, but not un- 
til the mangled forces of the 
Basics staggered forth did the 
outcome of the battle reveal it- 
self. Carcolo shook his head in 
sour bewilderment. “The crafty 
devil, Joaz Banbeck! He’s turned 
them back. He’s slaughtered their 
best!” 

“It would appear,” said Bast 
Givven, “that dragons armed 
with fangs, swords and steel balls 
are more effective than men with 
guns and heat-beams — at least 
in close quarters.” 

Carcolo grunted. “I might have 
done as well myself, under like 
circumstances.” He turned Bast 
Givven a waspish glance. 

“Do you not agree?” 
“Certainly. Beyond question.” 
“Of course,” Carcolo went on, 
“I had not the advantage of pre- 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

paration. The Basics surprised 
me, but Joaz Banbeck labored 
under no such handicap.” He 
looked back down into Banbeck 
Vale, where the Basic ship was 
bombarding the Jambles, shat- 
tering rocks into splinters. “Do 
they plan to blast the Jambles 
out of the valley? In which case, 
of course, Joaz Banbeck would 
have no further refuge. Their 
strategy is clear. And as I sus- 
pected: reserve forces!” 

Another thirty Troopers had 
marched down the ramp to stand 
immobile in the trampled field 
before the ship. 

Carcolo pounded his fist into 
his palm. “Bast Givven, listen 
now, listen carefully! For it is in 
our power to do a great deed, to 
reserve our fortunes! Notice 
Clybourne Crevasse, how it 
opens into the Vale, directly be- 
behind the Basic ship.” 

“Your ambition will yet cost 
us our lives.” 

Carcolo laughed. “Come, Giv- 
ven, how many times does a man 
die? What better way to lose a 
life than in the pursuit of glory?” 
Bast Givven turned, surveyed 
the meager remnants of the Hap- 
py Valley army. “We could win 
glory by trouncing a dozen sac- 
erdotes. Flinging ourselves upon 
a Basic ship is hardly needful.” 
“Nevertheless,” said Ervis Car- 
colo, “that is how it must be. I 
ride ahead, you marshal the 



forces and follow. We meet at the 
head of Clybourne Crevasse, on 
the west edge of the Vale!” 

XII 

STAMPING his feet, mutter- 
^ ing nervous curses, Ervis 
Carcolo waited at the head of 
Clybourne Crevasse. 

Unlucky chance after chance 
paraded before his imagination. 
The Basics might surrender to 
the difficulties of Banbeck Vale 
and depart. Joaz Banbeck might 
attack across the open fields to 
save Banbeck Village from de- 
struction and so destroy himself. 
Bast Givven might be unable to 
control the disheartened men 
and mutinous dragons of Happy 
Valley. Any of these situations 
might occur; any would expunge 
Carcolo’s dreams of glory and 
leave him a broken man. 

Back and forth he paced the 
scarred granite. Every few sec- 
onds he peered down into Ban- 
beck Vale. Every few seconds he 
turned to scan the bleak skylines 
for the dark shapes of his drag- 
ons, the taller silhouettes of his 
men. 

Beside the Basic ship waited a 
scanty two squads of Heavy 
Troopers: those who had sur- 
vived the original attack and the 
reserves. They squatted in silent 
groups, watching the leisurely 
destruction of Banbeck Village.

GALAXY 



Fragment by fragment, the 
spires, towers and cliffs which 
had housed the Banbeck folk 
cracked off, slumped down into 
an ever-growing mound of rub- 
ble. An even heavier barrage 
poured against the Jambles. 
Boulders broke like eggs. Rock 
splinters drifted down the valley. 

A half hour passed. Ervis Car- 
colo seated himself glumly on a 
rock. 

A jingle, the pad of feet: Car- 
colo bounded to his feet. Wind- 
ing across the skyline came the 
sorry remnants of his forces, the 
men dispirited, the Termagants 
surly and petulant, a mere hand- 
ful each of Fiends, Blue Horrors 
and Murderers. 

Carcolo’s shoulders sagged. 
What could be accomplished 
with a force so futile as this? He 
took a deep breath. Show a brave 
front! Never say die! He assumed 
his bluffest mien. Stepping for- 
ward, he cried out, “Men, drag- 
ons! Today we have known de- 
feat, but the day is not over. The 
time of redemption is at hand; 
we shall revenge ourselves on 
both the Basics and Joaz Ban- 
beck!” 

He searched the faces of his 
men, hoping for enthusiasm. 
They looked back at him without 
interest. The dragons, their un- 
derstanding less complete, 
snorted softly, hissed and whis- 
pered. “Men and dragons!” 



bawled Carcolo. “You ask me, 
how shall we achieve these 
glories? I answer, follow where I 
lead! Fight where I fight! What 
is death to us, with our valley 
despoiled?” 

Again he inspected his troops, 
once more finding only listless- 
ness and apathy. Carcolo stifled 
the roar of frustration which rose 
into his throat, and turned away. 
“Advance!” he called gruffly over 
his shoulder. Mounting his droop- 
ing Spider, he set off down Cly- 
boume Crevasse. 

T^HE Basic ship pounded the 
Jambles and Banbeck Vil- 
lage with equal vehemence. From 
a vantage on the west rim of the 
valley Joaz Banbeck watched the 
blasting of corridor after familiar 
corridor. Apartments and halls 
hewn earnestly from the rock, 
carved, tooled, polished across 
the generations — all opened, de- 
stroyed, pulverized. Now the tar- 
get became that spire which con- 
tained Joaz Banbeck’s private 
apartments, with his study, his • 
workroom, the Banbeck reliquari- 
um. 

Joaz clenched and unclenched 
his fists, furious at his own help- 
lessness. The goal of the Basics 
was clear. They intended to de- 
stroy Banbeck Vale, to extermi- 
nate as completely as possible 
the men of Aerlith — and what 
could prevent them? 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

Joaz studied the Jambles. The 
old talus had been splintered 
away almost to the sheer face of 
the cliff. Where was the opening 
into the Great Hall of the sacer- 
dotes? His far-fetched hypotheses 
were diminishing to futility. 
Another hour would see the 
utter devastation of Banbeck 
Village. 

Joaz tried to control a sicken- 
ing sense of frustration. How to 
stop the destruction? He forced 
himself to calculate. Clearly, an 
attack across the valley floor was 
equivalent to suicide. But behind 
the black ship opened a ravine 
i similar to that in which Joaz 
i stood concealed: Clybourne Cre- 
vasse. The ship’s entry gaped 
wide, Heavy Troopers squatted 
listlessly to the side. Joaz shook 
his head with a sour grimace. In- 
conceivable that the Basics could 
neglect so obvious a threat. 

Still — in their arrogance might 
they not overlook the possibility 
of so insolent an act? 

Indecision tugged Joaz for- 
ward and backward. And now a 
barrage of explosive pellets split 
open the spire which housed his 
apartments. The reliquarium, 
the ancient trove of the Ban- 
beck’s, was about to be destroyed 
. Joaz made a blind gesture, 
jumped to his feet, called the 
closest of his dragon-masters. 

“Assemble the Murderers, 

' three squads of Termagants, two 

THE DRAGON MASTERS 



dozen Blue Horrors, ten Fiends, 
all the riders. We climb to Ban- 
beck Verge. We descend Cly- 
bourne Crevasse. We attack the 
ship!” 

The dragon-master departed. 
Joaz gave himself to gloomy con- 
templation. If the Basics in- 
tended to draw him into a trap, 
they were about to succeed. 

The dragon-master returned. 
“The force is assembled.” 

“We ride.” 

Up the ravine surged men and 
dragons, emerging upon Banbeck 
Verge. Swinging south, they came 
to the head of Clybourne Cre- 
vasse. 

A knight at the head of the 
column suddenly signaled a halt. 
When Joaz approached he 
pointed out marks on the floor 
of the crevasse. “Dragons and 
men have passed here recently.” 

Joaz studied the tracks. “Head- 
ing down the crevasse.” 

“Yes.” 

Joaz dispatched a party of 
scouts who presently came gal- 
loping wildly back. “Ervis Car- 
colo, with men and dragons, is 
attacking the ship!” 

Joaz wheeled his Spider and 
plunged headlong down the dim 
passage, followed by his army. 

/"kUT CRIES and screams of 
battle reached their ears as 
they approached the mouth of 
the crevasse. Bursting out on the 



87 



valley floor Joaz came upon a 
scene of desperate carnage, with 
dragon and Heavy Trooper hack- 
ing, stabbing, burning, blasting. 
Where was Ervis Carcolo?? Joaz 
recklessly rode to look into the 
entry port. It hung wide! Ervis 
Carcolo then had forced his way 
into the ship! 

A trap? Or had he effectuated 
Joaz’s own plan of seizing the 
ship? What of the Heavy Troop- 
ers? Would the Basics sacrifice 
forty warriors to capture a hand- 
ful of men? Unreasonable — but 
now the Heavy Troopers were 
holding their own. They had 
formed a phalanx, they now con- 
centrated the energy of their 
weapons on those dragons who 
yet opposed them. A trap? If so, 
it was sprung — unless Ervis 
Carcolo already had captured 
the ship. Joaz rose in his saddle, 
signaled his company. “Attack!” 

The Heavy Troopers were 
doomed. Striding Murderers 
hewed from above, Long-horned 
Murderers thrust from below, 
Blue Horrors pinched, clipped, 
dismembered. The battle was 
done, but Joaz, with men and 
Termagants, had already charged 
up the ramp. From within came 
the hum and throb of power, and 
also human sounds — cries and 
shouts of fury. 

The sheer ponderous bulk 
struck at Joaz. He stopped short, 
peered uncertainly into the ship. 



Behind him his men waited, mut- 
tering under their breath. 

Joaz asked himself, “Am I as 
brave as Ervis Carcolo? What is 
bravery, in any case? I am com- 
pletely afraid: I dare not enter, 
I dare not stay outside.” He put 
aside all caution and rushed for- 
ward, followed by his men and a 
horde of scuttling Termagants. 

Even as Joaz entered the ship 
he knew Ervis Carcolo had not 
succeeded. Above him the guns 
still sang and hissed. Joaz’s apart- 
ments splintered apart. Another 
tremendous volley struck into the 
Jambles, laying bare the naked 
stone of cliff, and what was 
hitherto hidden: the edge of a 
tall opening. 

Joaz, inside the ship, found 
himself in an ante-chamber. The 
inner port was closed. He sidled 
forward, peered through a rec- 
tangular pane into what seemed 
a lobby or staging chamber. Er- 
vis Carcolo and his knights 
crouched against the far wall, 
casually guarded by about twen- 
ty Weaponeers. A group of 
Basics rested in an alcove to the 
side, relaxed, quiet, their attitude 
one of contemplation. 

Carcolo and his men were not 
completely subdued. As Joaz 
watched Carcolo lunged furious- 
ly forward. A purple crackle of 
energy punished him, hurled him 
back against the wall. 

From the alcove one of the 



88 



GALAXY 



Basics, staring across the inner 
chamber, took note of Joaz Ban- 
beck. He flicked out with his 
brach, touched a rod. An alarm 
whistle sounded, the outer port 
slid shut. A trap? An emergency 
process? The result was the 
same. Joaz motioned to four men, 
heavily burdened. They came 
forward, kneeled, placed on the 
deck four of the blast cannon 
which the Giants had carried into 
the Jambles. 

Joaz swung his arm. Cannon 
belched; metal creaked, melted; 
acrid odors permeated the room. 
The hole was still too small. 
“Again!” The cannon flamed; the 
inner port vanished. 

Into the gap sprang Weapon- 
eers, firing their energy guns. 
Purple fire cut into the Banbeck 
ranks. Men curled, twisted, 
wilted, fell with clenched fingers 
and contorted faces. Before the 
cannon could respond, red-scaled 
shapes scuttled forward: Terma- 
gants. Hissing and wailing, they 
swarmed over the Weaponeers, 
on into the staging chamber. In 
front of the alcove occupied by 
the Basics they stopped short, as 
if in astonishment. The men 
crowding after fell silent. Even 
Carcolo watched in fascination. 

Basic stock confronted its de- 
rivative, each seeing in the other 
its caricature. The Termagants 
crept forward with sinister de- 
liberation. The Basics waved 



their brachs, whistled, fluted. The 
Termagants scuttled forward, 
sprang into the alcove. 

There was a horrid tumbling 
and croaking. Joaz, sickened at 
some elementary level, was 
forced tp look away. The struggle 
was soon over. 

There was silence in the al- 
cove. Joaz turned to examine Er- 
vis Carcolo, who stared back, 
rendered inarticulate by anger, 
humiliation, pain and fright. 

TT'INALLY finding his voice 
Carcolo made an awkward 
gesture of menace and fury. “Be 
off with you,” he croaked. “I claim 
this ship. Unless you would lie 
in your own blood, leave me to 
my conquest!” 

Joaz snorted contemptuously, 
turned his back on Carcolo, who 
sucked in his breath, and with 
a whispered curse, lurched for- 
ward. Bast Givven seized him, 
drew him back. Carcolo strug- 
gled. Givven talked earnestly into 
his ear, and Carcolo at last re- 
laxed, half-weeping. 

Joaz meanwhile examined the 
chamber. The walls were blank, 
gray; the deck was covered with 
resilient black foam. There was 
no obvious illumination, but 
light was everywhere, exuding 
from the walls. The air chilled 
the skin, and smelled unpleasant- 
ly acrid: an odor which Joaz had 
not previously noticed. He 



THE DRAGON MASTERS 



89 



coughed. His ear-drums rang. 

A frightening suspicion be- 
came certainty. On heavy legs 
he lunged for the port, beckoning 
to his troops. “Outside, they poi- 
son us!” He stumbled out on the 
ramp, gulped fresh air. His men 
and Termagants followed, and 
then in a stumbling rush came 
Ervis Carcolo and his men. Un- 
der the hulk of the great ship the 
group stood gasping, tottering on 
limp legs, eyes dim and swim- 
ming. 

Above them, oblivious or care- 
less of their presence, the ship’s 
guns sent forth another barrage. 
The spire housing Joaz’s apart- 
ments tottered, collapsed. The 
Jambles were no more than a 
heap of rock splinters drifting in- 
to a high arched opening. Inside 
the opening Joaz glimpsed a dark 
shape, a glint, a shine, a structure 
— then he was distracted by an 
ominous sound at his back. From 
a port at the other end of the 
ship, a new force of Heavy Troop- 
ers had alighted. Three new 
squads of twenty men each, ac- 
companied by a dozen Weapon- 
eers with four of the rolling pro- 
jectors. 

Joaz sagged back in dismay. 

He glanced along his troops. 
They were in no condition either 
to attack or defend. A single al- 
ternative remained: flight. “Make 
for Clybourne Crevasse,” he 
called thickly. 



Stumbling, lurching, the rem- 
nants of the two armies fled un- 
der the brow of the great black 
ship. Behind them Heavy Troop- 
ers swung smartly forward, but 
without haste. 

Rounding the ship, Joaz 
stopped short. In the mouth of 
Clybourne Crevasse waited a 
fourth squad of Heavy Troopers, 
with another Weaponeer and his 
weapon. 

J OAZ looked to right and left, 
up and down the valley. 
Which way to run, where to turn? 
The Jambles? They were non- 
existent. Motion, slow and pon- 
derous in the opening previously 
concealed by tumbled rock 
caught his attention. A dark ob- 
ject moved forth. A shutter drew 
back, a bright disk glittered. Al- 
most instantly a pencil of milky 
blue radiance lanced at, into, 
through the end-disk of the Basic 
ship. 

Within, tortured machinery 
whined, simultaneously up and 
down the scale, to inaudibility at 
either end. The luster of the end- 
disks vanished. They became 
gray, dull; the whisper of power 
and life previously pervading the 
ship gave way to dead quiet. The 
ship itself was dead, and its mass, 
suddenly unsupported, crushed 
groaning into the ground. 

The Heavy Troopers gazed 
up in consternation at the hulk 



90 



GALAXY 



which had brought them to Aer- 
lith. Joaz, taking advantage of 
their indecision, called, “Retreat! 
North — up the valley!” 

The Heavy Troopers doggedly 
followed. The Weaponeers how- 
ever cried out an order to halt. 
They emplaced their weapons, 
brought them to bear on the 
cavern behind the Jambles. With- 
in the opening naked shapes 
moved with frantic haste. There 
was slow shifting of massive ma- 
chinery, a change of lights and 
shadows, and the milky blue 
shaft of radiance struck forth 
once more. It flicked down. 

Weaponeers, weapons, two- 
thirds of the Heavy Troopers 
vanished like moths in a furnace. 
The surviving Heavy Troopers 
halted, retreated uncertainly 
toward the ship. 

In the mouth of Clybourne 
Crevasse waited the remaining 
squad of Heavy Troopers. The 
single Weaponeer crouched over 
his three-wheeled mechanism. 

With fateful care he made his 
adjustments. Within the dark 
opening the naked sacerdotes 
worked furiously, thrusting, 
wedging, the strain of their 
sinews and hearts and minds 
communicating itself to every 
man in the valley. The shaft of 
milky-blue light sprang forth, 
but too soon: it melted the rock 
a hundred yards south of Cly- 
bourne Crevasse, and now from 



the Weaponeer’s gun came a 
splash of orange and green flame. 
Seconds later the mouth of the 
sacerdote’s cavern erupted. 
Rocks, bodies, fragments of 
metal, glass, rubber arched 
through the air. 

The sound of the explosion re- 
verberated through the valley. 
And the dark object in the cav- 
ern was destroyed, was no more 
than tatters and shreds of metal. 

Joaz took three deep breaths, 
throwing off the effects of the 
narcotic gas by sheer power of 
will. He signaled to his Murder- 
ers. “Charge! Kill!” 

The Murderers loped forward. 

The Heavy Troopers threw 
themselves flat, aimed their 
weapons, but soon died. In the 
mouth of Clybourne Crevasse the 
final squad of Troopers charged 
wildly forth, to be instantly at- 
tacked by Termagants and Blue 
Horrors who had sidled along the 
face of the cliff. The Weaponeer 
was gored by a Murderer. There 
was no further resistance in the 
valley, arid the ship lay open to 
attack. 

Joaz led the way back up the 
ramp, through the entry into the 
now dim staging-chamber. The 
blast-cannon captured from the 
Giants lay where his men had 
dropped them. 

Three portals led from the 
chamber, and these were swiftly 
burned down. The first revealed 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

a spiral ramp. The second, a long 
empty hall lined with tiers of 
bunks. The third, a similar hall 
in which the bunks were occu- 
pied. Pale faces peered from the 
tiers, pallid hands flickered. Up 
and down the central corridor 
marched squat matrons in gray 
gowns. Ervis Carcolo rushed for- 
ward, buffeting the matrons to 
the deck, peering into the bunks. 
“Outside,” he bellowed. “You are 
rescued, you are saved. Outside 
quickly, while there is opportu- 
nity.” 

But there was only meager re- 
sistance to overcome from a half- 
dozen Weaponeers and Trackers, 
none whatever from twenty Me- 
chanics — these, short thin men 
with sharp features and dark 
hair — and none from the six- 
teen remaining Basics. 

All were marched off the ship 
as prisoners. 

XIII 

Q UIET filled the valley floor, 
the silence of exhaustion. 
Men and dragons sprawled in 
the trampled fields. The captives 
stood in a dejected huddle be- 
side the ship. Occasionally an iso- 
lated sound came to emphasize 
the silence: the creak of cooling 
metal within the ship, the fall of 
a loose rock from the shattered 
cliffs; an occasional murmur 
from the liberated Happy Valley 



folk, who sat in a group apart 
from the surviving warriors. 

Ervis Carcolo alone seemed 
restless. For a space he stood with 
his back to Joaz, slapping his 
thigh with his scabbard tassel. He 
contemplated the sky where 
Skene, a dazzling atom, hung 
close over the western cliffs, then 
turned, studied the shattered gap 
at the north of the valley, filled 
with the twisted remains of the 
sacerdotes’ construction. He gave 
his thigh a final slap, looked 
toward Joaz Banbeck, turned to 
stalk through the huddle of Hap- 
py Valley folk, making brusque 
motions of no particular signifi- 
cance, pausing here and there to 
harangue or cajole, apparently 
attempting to instill spirit and 
purpose into his defeated people. 

In this purpose he was unsuc- 
cessful. Presently he swung 
sharply about and marched across 
the field to where Joaz Banbeck 
lay outstretched. 

Carcolo stared down. “Well, 
then,” he said bluffly. “The battle 
is over, the ship is won.” 

Joaz raised himself up on one 
elbow. “True.” 

“Let us have no misunder- 
standing on one point,” said Car- 
colo. “Ship and contents are mine. 
An ancient rule defines the 
rights of him who is first to at- 
tack. On this rule I base my 
claim.” 

Joaz looked up in surprise, and 



92 



GALAXY 



seemed almost amused. “By a 
rule even more ancient, I have 
already assumed possession.” 

“I dispute this assertion,” said 
Carcolo hotly. “Who — ” 

Joaz held up his hand wearily. 
“Silence, Carcolo! You are alive 
now only because I am sick of 
blood and violence. Do not test 
my patience!” 

Carcolo turned away, twitch- 
ing his scabbard tassel with re- 
strained fury. He looked up the 
valley, turned back to Joaz. 
“Here come the sacerdotes, who 
in fact demolished the ship. I 
remind you of my proposal, by 
which we might have prevented 
this destruction and slaughter.” 
Joaz smiled. “You made your 
proposal only two days ago. Fur- 
ther, the sacerdotes possess no 
weapons.” 

Carcolo stared as if Joaz had 
taken leave of his wits. “Then 
how did they destroy the ship?” 
Joaz shrugged. “I can only 
make conjectures.” 

Carcolo asked sarcastically, 
“And what direction do these con- 
jectures lead?” 

“I wonder if they had con- 
structed the frame of a space- 
ship. I wonder if they turned the 
propulsion beam against the 
Basic ship.” 

Carcolo pursed his mouth du- 
biously. “Why should the sacer- 
dotes build themselves a space- 
ship?” 



“The Demie approaches. Why 
do you not put your question to 
him?” 

“I will do so,” said Carcolo with 
dignity. 

But the Demie, followed by 
four younger sacerdotes and 
walking with the air of a man in 
a dream, passed without speak- 
ing. 

J OAZ rose to his knees and 
watched after him. The De- 
mie apparently planned to mount 
the ramp and enter the ship. 
Joaz jumped to his feet, followed, 
barred the way to the ramp. 

Politely he asked, ‘What do 
you seek, Demie?” 

“I seek to board the ship.” 

“To what end? I ask, of course, 
from sheer curiosity.” 

The Demie inspected him a 
moment without reply. His face 
was haggard and tight. His eyes 
gleamed like frost-stars. Finally 
he replied, in a voice hoarse with 
emotion. “I wish to determine if 
the ship can be repaired.” 

Joaz considered a moment, 
then spoke in a gentle rational 
voice. “The information can be 
of little interest to you. Would 
the sacerdotes place themselves 
so completely under my com- 
mand?” 

“We obey no one.” 

“In that case, I can hardly take 
you with me when I leave.” 

The Demie swung around, and

for a moment seemed as if he 
would walk away. His eyes fell 
on the shattered opening at the 
end of the vale, and he turned 
back. 

He spoke, not in the measured 
voice of a sacerdote, but in a 
burst of grief and fury. “This is 
your doing! You preen yourself, 
you count yourself resourceful 
and clever. You forced us to act, 
and thereby violate ourselves and 
our dedication!” 

Joaz nodded, with a faint grim 
smile. “I knew the opening must 
lie behind the Jambles. I won- 
dered if you might be building a 
space-ship; I hoped that you 
might protect yourselves against 
the Basics, and so serve my pur- 
poses. I admit your charges. I 
used you and your construction 
as a weapon, to save myself and 
my people. Did I do wrong?” 
“Right or wrong — who can 
weigh? You wasted our effort 
across more than eight hundred 
Aerlith years! You destroyed 
more than you can ever replace.” 
“I destroyed nothing, Demie. 
The Basics destroyed your ship. 
If you had cooperated with us 
in the defense of Banbeck Vale 
this disaster would have never 
occurred. You choose neutrality. 
You thought yourselves immune 
from our grief and pain. As you 
see, such is not the case.” 

“And meanwhile our labor of 
eight hundred and twelve years

GALAXY 



goes to naught,” the Demie said. 

Joaz asked with feigned in- 
nocence, “Why did you need a 
space-ship? Where do you plan 
to travel?” 

f | 'HE Demie’s eyes burst with 
flames as intense as those of 
Skene. “When the race of men is 
gone, then we go abroad. We 
move across the galaxy. We re- 
populate the terrible old worlds, 
and the new universal history 
starts from that day, with the 
past wiped clean as if it never 
existed. If the grephs destroy 
you, what is it to us? We await 
only the death of the last man 
in the universe.” 

“Do you not consider your- 
selves men?” 

“We are as you know us — 
above-men.” 

At Joaz’s shoulder someone 
laughed coarsely. Joaz turned his 
head to see Ervis Carcolo. “ ‘Over- 
men’?” mocked Carcolo. “Poor 
naked waifs of the caves! What 
can you display to prove your 
superiority?” 

The Demie’s mouth drooped, 
the lines of his face deepened. 
“We have our tands. We have 
our knowledge. We have our 
strength.” 

Carcolo turned away with an- 
other coarse laugh. Joaz said in 
a subdued voice, “I feel more pity 
for you than you ever felt for us.” 

Carcolo returned. “And where 



did you learn to build a space- 
ship? From your own efforts? Or 
from the work of men before you, 
men of the old times?” 

“We are the ultimate men,” 
said the Demie. “We know all 
that men have ever thought, 
spoken or devised. We are the 
last and the first. And when the 
under-folk are gone, we shall re- 
new the cosmos as innocent and 
fresh as rain.” 

“But men have never gone and 
will never go,” said Joaz. “A set- 
back, yes. But is not the universe 
wide? Somewhere are the worlds 
of men. With the help of the 
Basics and their Mechanics, I 
will repair the ship and go forth 
to find these worlds.” 

“You will seek in vain,” said 
the Demie. 

“These worlds do not exist?” 

“The Human Empire is dis- 
solved. Men exist only in feeble 
groups.” 

“What of Eden, old Eden?” 

“A myth, no more.” 

“My marble globe, what of 
that?” 

“A toy. An imaginative fabri- 
cation.” 

“How can you be sure?” asked 
Joaz, troubled in spite of himself. 

“Have I not said that we know 
all of history? We can look into 
our tands and see deep into the 
past, until the recollections are 
dim and misty, and never do we 
remember planet Eden.” 



THE DRAGON MASTERS

Joaz shook his head stubborn- 
ly. “There must be an original 
world from which men came. Call 
it Earth or Tempe or Eden; 
somewhere it exists.” 

The Demie started to speak, 
then in a rare show of irresolution 
held his tongue. Joaz said, “Per- 
haps you are right. Perhaps we 
are the last men. But I shall go 
forth to look.” 

“I shall come with you,” said 
Ervis Carcolo. 

“You will be fortunate to find 
yourself alive tomorrow,” said 
Joaz. 

Carcolo drew himself up. “Do 
not dismiss my claim to the ship 
so carelessly!” 

Joaz struggled for words, but 
could find none. What to do with 
the unruly Carcolo? He could not 
find in himself enough harshness 
to do what he knew should be 
done. He temporized, turned his 
back on Carcolo. 

“Now you know my plans,” he 
told the Demie. “If you do not 
interfere with me, I shall not in- 
terfere with you." 

The Demie moved slowly 
back. “Go then. We are a passive 
race. We despise ourselves for 
our activity of today. Perhaps it 
was our greatest mistake . But 
go, seek your forgotten world. 
You will only perish somewhere 
among the stars. We will wait, as 
1 already we have waited.” He 
turned and walked away, fol- 



lowed by the four younger sacer- 
dotes, who had all the time stood 
gravely to the side. 

Joaz called after him. “And if 
the Basics come again? Will you 
fight with us? Or against us?” 

The Demie made no response, 
but walked to the north, the long 
white hair swinging down his thin 
shoulder-blades. 

Joaz watched him a moment, 
gazed up and down the ruined 
valley, shook his head in wonder 
and puzzlement, turned back to 
study the great black ship. 

CKENE touched the western 
^ cliffs. There was an instant 
dimming of light, a sudden chill. 

Carcolo approached him. “To- 
night I shall hold my folk here in 
Banbeck Vale, and send them 
home on the morrow. Meanwhile, 
I suggest that you board the ship 
with me and make a preliminary 
survey.” 

Joaz took a deep breath. Why 
could it not come easier for him? 
Carcolo had twice sought his life, 
and, had positions been reversed, 
would have shown him no mercy. 
He forced himself to act. His 
duty to himself, to his people, to 
his ultimate goal, was clear. 

He called to those of his 
knights who carried the captured 
heat-guns. They approached. 

Joaz said, “Take Carcolo into 
Clybourne Crevasse. Execute him 
at once.”

Protesting, bellowing, Carcolo 
.was dragged off. Joaz turned 
away with a heavy heart, and 
sought Bast Givven. “I take you 
for a sensible man.” 

“I regard myself so.” 

“I set you in charge of Happy 
Valley. Take your folk home, be- 
fore darkness falls.” 

Bast Givven silently went to 
his people. They stirred, and 
presently departed Banbeck 
Vale. 

Joaz crossed the valley floor 
to the tumble of rubble which 
choked Kergan’s Way. He 
choked with fury as he looked 
upon the destruction, and for a 
moment almost wavered in his 
resolve. Might it not be fit to fly 
the black ship to Coralyne and 
take revenge on the Basics? He 



walked around to stand under 
the spire which had housed his 
apartments, and by some strange 
freak of chance came upon a 
rounded fragment of yellow mar- 
ble. 

Weighing this in his palm he 
looked up into the sky where 
Coralyne already twinkled red, 
and tried to bring order to his 
mind. 

The Banbeck folk had 
emerged from the deep tunnels. 
Phade the minstrel-maiden came 
to find him. “What a terrible 
day,” she murmured. “What aw- 
ful events. What a great victory.” 

Joaz tossed the bit of yellow 
marble back into the rubble. “I 
feel much the same way. And 
.where it all ends, no one knows 
'less than I!” — JACK VANCE

In October Galaxy we begin a two-part serial called Plague of 
Pyfhons — the by-line is Frederik Pohl — and add to it at least a pair of 
first-class novelettes: The Ballad of Lost C'Mell, by Cordwainer Smith, and 
Who Dares a Bulbur Eat? by Gordon R. Dickson. We say "at least a pair;" 
actually, Theodore Sturgeon is hard at work on the final draft of one 
that we plan to rush into print if we get it in time — and that one is going 
to be worth reading! — but it remains to be seen if it'll be in the next 
issue or later. 

Anyway, there'll be shorts, a particularly interesting Willy Ley column,

HAND 




J AMES Ypsilanti swung at the 
door with the steak cuber. Or 
was it the cube steaker? No 
matter. The door was a good, 
hardwood door and resisted his 
onslaught well. But time was on 
his side. 

He had the energy and the 
time, he knew, and sooner or later 
“the door would be kindling. 

It was the door to his room. It 
was evident to him that he did 
not need the door to his room 
and that he did need heat. In fact 
he had better get some heat 
pretty soon — although he was 
keeping warm enough for the 
present by beating on the door. 
So he would beat this door to 
kindling, and then he would build 



a nice, cozy fire in the hall that 
would keep him warm for a long 
time ... if he was stingy with his 
fuel. 

The carpenter came by. The 
carpenter was always coming by, 
except when you wanted him, Jim 
realized. The carpenter was a 
mighty, mighty busy fellow. 

The carpenter stopped short 
when he saw Jim demolishing the 
door. In fact he came to a grind- 
ing halt. 

“Jim, why didn’t you tell me!” 

“Carpenter, how was I to know 
where you were? Who can ever 
find you?” 

“I know Jim. Jim, you work 
so hard!” 

“Yes!” he said, pounding. 



98 



GALAXY 



“Take this hatchet, Jim. A 
hatchet is what you demolish 
doors with! Good-by.” The car- 
penter departed. 

James Ypsilanti swung on the 
door with his newly acquired 
hatchet. Soon he was ready for 
his fire. He struck a match, and 
in no time had the pile of var- 
nished kindling blazing smokily 
in the hall. He held his hands 
over the blaze. 

“Ah, good, good. Good.” He 
closed his eyes. “What could be 
better than this?” Then he opened 
them again regretfully. “It’s din- 
ner time. I’d better fix it while 
I have my fire going.” He hurried 
to the kitchen and chose a can 
of eggs-bacon-and-pancakes from 
the massive stores. 

i^WPENING the large can, he 
” heated it over his hall fire. 
Then he dumped the contents on 
his tin plate and ate. 

“Murder,” he thought somber- 
ly. “That’s what I’m in for. 
Practically murder with consent. 
She said she couldn’t live without 
me. Margie begged me to kill her, 
you might as well say. Good old 
Margie; a good kid, but I killed 
her. And now . Well, that’s 
life!” He speared a pancake. 

“Damn, but it’s cold!” He threw 
an armload of wood on the fire 
and it blazed up. “Sure wish these 
carpenters had feelings. My lord, 
they got no feelings at all!” 



The carpenter arrived with a 
new hardwood door. Whistling 
cheerily, he began to install it 
where the other one had just been 
hatcheted away. 

“Carpenter, that door won’t be 
staying there long. I’m almost out 
of fuel.” 

“I hope you don’t expect me to 
be surprised, Jim, if this door 
doesn’t last very long. The previ- 
ous twenty-two doors at this lo- 
cation, Jim, did not last very long 
either.” Still whistling to himself, 
he installed the last of the hinge 
screws. 

“Why don’t you just give me 
the doors, instead of causing your- 
self all this work?” demanded 
James Ypsilanti. 

“ ‘Inmates will not be issued 
materials,’ Jim. I’ve quoted that 
section of the rules to you many 
times, Jim.” 

“But couldn’t you just lean the 
door up against the door jamb 
and leave it?” argued the inmate. 
“You go to a ridiculous amount of 
trouble.” 

“It is not ridiculous, Jim. I am 
a carpenter, Jim. Good-by.” 

After lunch, James Ypsilanti 
crawled into his escape tunnel. 

He liked to go in there every 
day and daydream. The tunnel 
ended abortively at the wall of 
the prison, for the prison wall ex- 
tended down into solid bed rock 
for a meter, and it was fabricated 
of one-meter thick compressed 



HAN DYMAN

steel. It was the nearest thing to 
an exit that the prison had. 

Officials had always come and 
gone through the massive, englob- 
ing wall by matter transmitters. 
“Smarties couldn’t find me 
though, when I was in my escape 
tunnel.” he chortled, as he 
stretched out in the cave under 
the concrete. “They can walk 
through walls, but they couldn’t 
find me.” Then his tone became 
baleful. “The smarties’ll never 
find me.” 

A S JAMES Ypsilanti chopped 
on the door next day, the car- 
penter stood cheerily watching. 

“Carpenter, why don’t you fix 
the damn heating plant? Then I 
wouldn’t have to be chopping up 
your doors all the time to keep 
warm.” 

“I am a carpenter, Jim, not a 
heat-plant fixer, as you well know 
from our previous negotiations on 
the subject.” 

“What will you do, carpenter, 
when I have used up all your 
doors?” the convict jibed. 

‘Why, Jim, we will have to 
send out for some more,” the 
carpenter answered condescend- 
ingly. 

“Still, I wish you would let me 
work on that he^t plant,” urged 
Ypsilanti. “I might fix it.” 

“ ‘Inmates will not be per- 
mitted to disassemble or other- 
wise interfere with the machinery 



of the institution,’ ” quoted the 
carpenter. “Need I say more, 
Jim?” 

“Okay,” said James Ypsilanti, 
resuming his destructive work on 
the new door. “Scram, stupid.” 
The carpenter departed. 

“That dope,” Jim said between 
blows, “is even foggier in the head 
than my lousy lawyer was, and 
that’s going some.” 

“Jim,” said the carpenter, re- 
turning and sounding very 
pleased with himself, “look here at 
what I have found, Jim.” 

James Ypsilanti turned to look 
at what the carpenter held in his 
hand. It was a carpenter’s square 
sheathed in plastic. 

“Found enough of them to last 
me a lifetime, Jim,” said the 
carpenter complacently. “I’ll 
never have to buy any.” 

“No, you won’t,” agreed James 
Ypsilanti bitterly. “Can’t you get 
it into your head that you and I 
are the only ones left on Earth? 
After the war the rest left. They 
couldn’t find us when they evacu- 
ated this atomic-explosion 
wrecked planet, because we were 
in this escape-proof jug. So they 
went away and left us!” 

“I know, Jim.” 

Ypsilanti studied the mobile 
features of the carpenter, search- 
ing intently for a sign. 

But the carpenter robot 
strolled away, whistling.

ROTATING LUMINOUS WHEELS IN THE SEA 

U SCIENCE,” I have told stu- 
^ dents and lecture audiences 
on numerous occasions, “is a self- 
correcting process. It never stands 
still, mainly because new material 
is constantly being added.” 

This column is just one more 
illustration for this statement. 
When I reported on Commander 
Bodler’s encounter with a gigan- 
tic luminous, rotating “pinwheel” 
in the waters of the Gulf of Oman 
I had only vaguely heard of such 
a phenomenon before. (If you 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



101 



keep a file of Galaxy, please re- 
read his report in the December 
1960 issue.) A reader then called 
my attention to a chapter in one 
of Charles Fort’s books and I was 
able to quote half a dozen more 
cases ( Galaxy , June 1961.) 
While I was still brooding about 
the phenomenon I received an 
airmail letter from Arthur C. 
Clarke telling me that, according 
to a British scientific journal, a 
German publication contained a 
whole collection of such cases. 

Since these enormous, rotating, 
luminous wheels are such a 
breathtakingly unusual phenome- 
non — even sober logbook entries 
abound in terms like “weird,” 
“most awe inspiring,” “an effect 
of great eerieness,” unheimlich 
(German for fear-inspiring) and 
angstwekkende indruk (Dutch 
for fear-inspiring) — the source 
for what is to follow should be 
stated first. The journal in ques- 
tion is the Deutsche Hydro graph- 
ische Zeitschrift, vol. XIII, No. 2 
(April 1960), published in Ham- 
burg by the German Hydrograph- 
ic Institute. Incidentally, about 
three quarters of this article is in 
English. The author is Professor 
Dr. Kurt Kalle. Dr. Kalle’s 
sources, in turn, are mainly The 
Marine Observer, published by 
Her Britannic Majesty’s Station- 
ery Office, and some logbooks of 
German and Dutch vessels. 

None of the cases quoted in 



Dr. Kalle’s report are identical 
with the ones I reported in 
Galaxy. In the tabulation later in 
this column I have added the 
cases from the U. S. Naval Insti- 
tute Proceedings and from Fort’s 
book. 

r | ''HE total number of observa- 
tions quoted by Dr. Kalle is 
seventy, but not all of them are 
about rotating luminous wheels. 
In going through all the reports 
of highly unusual phosphorence 
in the sea that he could find he 
established several categories. At 
first these categories were merely 
to aid in sorting out, and were 
based on the described appear- 
ance of the phenomenon. Later, 
he found a very interesting and 
probably significant corollary. 
His first section, comprising six 
reports, he labelled “general and 
superficial descriptions,” a some- 
what harsh term, for some of 
them are impressive indeed. Be- 
sides I would have put three of 
these reports into the second 
section, which in Dr. Kalle’s 
article consists of 23 reports. 

These reports are all alike in 
that they describe what looks al- 
most like an explosion. “Balls of 
light” suddenly appear at the 
ocean’s surface, spreading out 
with utmost rapidity to cover an 
area of a hundred square yards 
or more. Here are a few examples 
of these reports:

View of three revolving phenomena from board of the S. S. Arracan. 
Observed December 19, 1927, northern part of the Andaman Sea. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



103 



The cargo ship Stephan was, 
on September 30, 1923, at 46' 
northern latitude and 15’ western 
longitude, which is in the Atlantic 
Ocean to the west of the Bay of 
Biscay. The sea phosphoresced 
and “occasionally an extra brilli- 
ant patch would seem to bubble 
up from the bottom of the sea, 
burst into vivid light and spread 
rapidly over the surface before 
gradually fading away.” 

The captain of the S.S. Omar 
had a very similar story to tell. 
His ship was at 7' 50’ N., 76' 18’ 
E., which is in the Indian Ocean 
to the South of Ceylon; the date 
was October 14, 1923. “These 
patches of light, whilst expand- 
ing, became very brilliant and 
after about two minutes died 
away. They commenced with a 
diameter of about one foot and 
expanded to at least 30 yards.” 
Two years later, on August 23, 
1925, the officer of the watch 
(not named) of the German pas- 
senger liner Preussen produced 
the following description: “From 
right next to the ship and up to 
the limit of vision luminous balls 
rose from the lower strata of the 
ocean. Their distances from each 
other varied from 12 to 100 feet. 
The time interval between ap- 
pearances varied between 20 and 
30 seconds. The balls seemed to 
rise with a speed of about half 
a yard per second and had an 
estimated diameter of 8 inches. 



Just below the surface they ex- 
panded to a diameter of about 
half a yard. When reaching the 
surface these spheres expanded 
and flattened. It looked as if they 
were bursting. The area occupied 
by such a phantom body was el- 
lipsoid in shape, with a major 
axis from 10 to 20 feet and a 
minor axis of 6 to 10 feet. The 
larger ones of them retained their 
intense silvery-greenish luminosi- 
ty with a shivering motion until 
we lost sight of them.” The loca- 
tion of the Preussen was also in 
the Indian Ocean, but to the west 
of that of the Omar, the precise 
position being 9‘ N., 63' East. 

A little more than a year later, 
on October 31, 1926, S. S. Somer- 
setshire, being in the same general 
area as the Omar and the Preus- 
sen (7' 30’ N, 74' 30’ E.) saw 
the same thing. P. H. Potter, the 
second officer, described it as 
“balls of brilliant light seemed to 
shoot from the depth, burst on 
nearing the surface, irradiate and 
cover an area, seemingly of a 
couple of hundred square yards.” 

]Y/|OST of the reports of “ex- 
ploding” balls of light come 
from the Indian Ocean, being 
strung out roughly along the 10th 
parallel of northern latitude from 
the African east coast to Ceylon’s 
west coast. 

Before I mention the interest- 
ing fact discovered by Dr. Kalle 



104 



GALAXY 




Talma. Observed December 28, 1929, 
northern part of the Andaman Sea. 

I have to explain briefly the other 
categories established by him. 
His category (C) consists of re- 
ports — eleven of them — which 
describe waves of light, apparent- 
ly parallel and not curved, which 
move rapidly across the surface 
of the sea. Category (D) com- 
prises seven reports about waves 
of light which have a motion as 
if they were rotating around a 
common center, the center, how- 
ever, being not visible to the ob- 
server who reported it. The final 
category, twenty-four reports, 
deals with rotating wheels which 
have a clearly visible center. 

When dealing with reports of 



this kind, the obvious first step 
is to take a map of the world and 
enter the various observations ac- 
cording to their geographical lo- 
cations. Naturally Dr. Kalle did 
this. He found that all the reports, 
except three, came from the Indi- 
an Ocean. Of the three which 
were not from the Indian Ocean 
two were from the Atlantic. One 
of them was that of the Stephan 
quoted above; the other one came 
from the John Holt, February 19, 
1957, from the vicinity of the 
Cape Verde Islands, also in the 
Atlantic. The third came from 
the S. S. Tasmania (May 21, 
1933), which was at sea to the 
west of the North Island of New 
Zealand. After Dr. Kalle had 
drawn his map he naturally en- 
tered the depth of the ocean at 
the places of the observation. The 
surprise came then. 

The average depth of the 
ocean for all cases of “exploding” 
light balls was over 10,000 feet. 
The least was about 1700 feet 
while one could not be judged 
properly. The location was just 
where the continental shelf slopes 
into the abyss. Since the ship’s 
position was not given within, say, 
200 yards, the depth of water 
under the keel could have been 
anything from 700 to 3500 feet. 
But the average depth for the 
waves of light, whether seemingly 
parallel or rotating was less than 
300 feet, again with two excep- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



105 



tions due to the nearness of the 
edge of the continental shelf. 

The only definite exception as 
regards the freshly established 
rule of shallow water for parallel 
or rotating light beams was the 
S. S. Somersetshire on August 13, 
1925. The position was 12" 38’ N., 
55" 28’ E, which is not very far 
from the east coast of Africa. As 
a matter of fact I do not consider 
the report made by P. Hawkins, 
the second officer, very typical 
for the parallel light waves, since 
he wrote: “A white line seemed to 
be coming toward the ship at a 
tremendous speed from the east- 
ward, which had the appearance 
of breakers. Very shortly after, 
the whole sea was quite white, 
with now and again circular and 
streaky black patches, and the 
whole surroundings were bril- 
liantly lightened up.” But Haw- 
kins added a very interesting 
comment: “During this time 

(9:20 P.M. till 10:40 P.M.) the 
atmospheric conditions were ex- 
traordinary. No sound was heard, 
not even the wind nor the break- 
ing of the sea. No swell was vis- 
ible; and the vessel, which had 
previously been rolling heavily, 
had practically no movement on 
her. In fact, one could almost 
have been in dock.” 

A FAR more typical report on 
the parallel waves was de- 
livered by D. Brown, the second 



officer of the S.S. City of Khios on 
July 23, 1954. The ship was at 
24" 19’ N., 66" 20’ E„ in the north- 
ernmost part of the Arabian Sea, 
with a depth of water of about 
200 feet. “Shafts of pale white 
light were observed moving 
swiftly NE-SW. They appeared 
to be just above the surface of 
the sea and parallel with each 
other. They were passing the ship 
at the rate of about one per sec- 
ond. They appeared to stretch as 
far as the eye could see on each 
side of the vessel and did not at 
any time appear to curve. After 
about 15 minutes the phenome- 
non disappeared.” 

While the experience of the 
S. S. Somersetshire must have 
been awe-inspiring, the case does 
not necessarily belong into this 
collection. If it be discarded as 
being “something else,” whatever 
that may be, there is no exception 
to the rule found by Dr. Kalle 
that the exploding balls are a 
deep-water phenomenon, while 
the light beams appear only over 
the continental shelf. He himself 
wrote that “this result reinforces 
the supposition that the distinc- 
tion into ‘exploding’ and ‘rotating’ 
types, which was based on the 
differences in appearance and be- 
havior, is essentially correct.” 

This fact is not very helpful 
in explaining either one of these 
phenomena. But in a field where 
observations (or at any event re-

ports) have become reasonably 
frequent only during the last 
three decades, any definite fact is 
welcome. It may become impor- 
tant at a later date when more is 
known. 

After quoting one more case 
of parallel light beams, because 
it contains an interesting guess, 
we can go on -to the rotating 
beams. That case was reported 
by Captain Bradley of the S. S. 
Aristo. It was seen in July, 1938 
(no date given) and the position 
of the vessel was 23" 56’ N., 66 ' 
53’ E., quite close to the position 
of the City of Khios. “The beams,” 
Captain Bradley wrote, “traveled 
in the reverse direction of the 
wind, sea and swell . The 
rapidly moving beams of lumi- 
nosity may have been caused by 
minute phosphorescent organisms 
turning in a certain direction. Not 
that they moved rapidly from 
place to place, but that they re- 
mained practically stationary 
and only altered position to ex- 
pose their luminous sides. What- 
ever the cause, the phenomenon 
was most awe-inspiring. No won- 
der that the mariners of old were 
so prone to superstition and re- 
turned to their native shores full 
of weird and wonderful tales of 
the sea.” 

The oldest report of rotating 
beams quoted by Dr. Kalle is 
dated May 23, 1906 and comes 
from the Gulf of Oman. The most 



interesting aspect is that it was 
observed from shore. The obser- 
ver, a German by the name of A. 
Stiirken, said that he was stand- 
ing on board a ship which had 
made fast on a pier near Bender 
Abbas. The geographical position 
of the pier is given as 26" N., 57" 
E. 

“The southern horizon was a 
luminous ribbon which looked 
precisely as if there were a heavy 
surf out there. The intensely 
bright luminescence approached 
us rapidly, shooting sharply de- 
fined light rays to the West in 
rapid succession, looking like the 
beam from the searchlight of a 
warship. Then the whole lumi- 
nous flood — always below the 
water’s surface — approached our 
ship. Wide waves of fire, 200 to 
300 yards long, came in endless 
succession and passed under our 
keel for a period of about three 
minutes. Then the picture 
changed suddenly. To the left of 
us, about 550 yards away, a gi- 
gantic fiery wheel formed itself 
with spokes that reached as far 
as one could see. The whole 
wheel whirled around for two or 
three minutes: Then all of the 
luminescence moved away, as 
fast as it had arrived. For a mo- 
ment it was visible near the 
horizon and then the appari- 
tion was over.” (The word used 
by Stiirken which I translated as 
“apparition” is Spuk, normally 



108 



GALAXY 



used for alleged supernatural 
phenomena, like seeing a ghost 
or witnessing Walpurgis Night.) 

1Y/JOST reports deal with the 
phenomenon when it is, if 
this phrase is applicable here, in 
full bloom. Most of the time the 
ship runs into a rotating wheel, 
or sees it some distance away. 
But the crew of the S.S. Aeneas 
saw it develop. The date was De- 
cember 3, 1926; the place 5” 48’ 
N., 98" 9’ E., in the Strait of Mal- 
acca, between Sumatra and the 
Malay Peninsula. The report was 
written by J. M. Anderson, who 
was second officer of the ship. 
The phenomenon began at 30 
minutes after midnight: 

“Commencing with but a few 
isolated points and patches of 
sparkling and pulsating light, the 
display developed until the sur- 
face of the sea from horizon to 
horizon had the appearance of 
being lit up from below, by 
thousands of beams of light which 
independently flashed and were 
eclipsed with great regularity, at 
intervals of about one second. 
This phosphorescence increased 
in brilliancy until 1:45 A.M. Two 
distinct systems of light waves or 
phosphorescent wheels were ob- 
served, one to port and one to 
starboard. These light waves 
were observed to be traveling 
clockwise over the surface of the 
sea, appearing to issue from a 



focus around which they rotated, 
increasing in brilliancy and ve- 
locity of rotation until 2:05 A.M. 
The phosphorescent points and 
patches previously described were 
noticed to increase in brilliancy 
as the illuminated beams swept 
over them and to decrease in 
intensity during the passage of 
the successive dark spaces, and 
this phenomenon was quite 
noticeable even when the light 
waves, toward the end of the dis- 
play, became quite faint. At 2:15 
A.M. the light waves were no 
longer visible, and at 2:30 A.M. 
the last traces of phosphorescence 
were observed.” 

The crew of the S. S. Arracan, 
on December 19, 1927, being in 
the same general area ( 14° 23’ N., 
96’ 3’ E.) also watched the devel- 
opment of a rather short-lived 
phenomenon. At 2 A.M. the ves- 
sel passed “through small clusters 
of phosphorescent light.” Very 
soon after, “these clusters of light 
expanded into bars and com- 
menced to revolve in an anti- 
clockwise direction, and appeared 
to pass the bridge, from where 
they were observed, at the rate of 
one every half second. This 
phenomenon was in the form of 
a Catherine wheel, the hub of 
which could be observed plainly 
about two hundred yards to the 
westward of the ship’s course. At 
2:05 A.M. the phosphorescent 
light failed, and then became 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



109 



brighter, and on this occasion the 
spokes or beams of light revolved 
in the opposite direction, i. e. 
clockwise. At 2:15 A.M. this 
phenomenon disappeared. On 
each occasion the hub of the 
Catherine wheel was clearly vis- 
ible to the westward of the ship.” 
Quite close to the position of 
the S. S. Arracan, namely at 14” 
15’ N, 96" 41’ E., and almost pre- 
cisely two years later, namely on 
December 28, 1929, the S.S. 

Talma also observed a rotating 
wheel. The “spokes” were curved 
(see Fig. 2) and about 30 feet 
wide when they hit the ship. The 
“spokes” followed each other at 
intervals of half a second. The 
hub of the wheel, which could not 
be seen very clearly, seemed to 
be about five miles from the ship. 
The duration of the whole was 
15 minutes. This report has an 
interesting postscript: “It was 

later reported from the engine 
room that at this time the revo- 
lutions [of the engine] dropped 
considerably and the main en- 
gines were straining. As this 
straining of the engines appeared 
to me to point to the possibility 
of a marine volcanic disturbance 
I considered it advisable to send 
out a wireless warning.” 

TT would serve little purpose to 
•*- quote more reports. They all 
read more or less alike and all 
stress the weird impressiveness 



of the sight — quite naturally, 
since for each observer it was the 
first time that he saw it. One ex- 
ception to that rule is the experi- 
ence of Captain R. W. White and 
his second officer, C. Jackman, 
who saw it three times, on Sep- 
tember 9, October 5 and Decem- 
ber 29, 1932. The location for all 
three observations was the Anda- 
man Sea and Second Officer 
Jackman, on the third occasion, 
merely entered: “Experienced 

the same phenomenon, duration 
26 minutes.” Well, one can also 
get used even to being under 
artillery bombardment, as many 
soldiers can testify. 

Geographically the phenome- 
non of the rotating lights clearly 
centers around two areas. The 
first one is the Gulf of Aden, the 
Persian Gulf and the Gulf of 
Oman, plus the coastline to the 
East of the Gulf of Oman to 
about Bombay. The other area 
is the sea around the Malay Pe- 
ninsula, the Andaman Sea, the 
Strait of Malacca and the Bor- 
neo Sea. 

For simplicity’s sake I referred 
to these two areas as the Western 
and the Eastern Phenomenon 
and, trying to see whether the 
seasons (admittedly not too no- 
ticeable in these tropical seas) 
had anything to do with the fre- 
quency of occurrence, I tabulated 
all reports as to their dates. (See 
table.)

It can be seen that the Western 
Phenomenon shows a rather faint 
clustering for the period from late 
March to the end of July, while 
the Eastern Phenomenon shows 
a somewhat more pronounced 
clustering for the period from 
October through December. But, 
since neither clustering is very 
pronounced, it might be argued 
that the apparent concentration 
during the last three months of 
the year for the Eastern Phe- 
nomenon is caused by the simple 
fact that the number of reports is 
not large enough to be meaning- 
ful. Dr. Kalle has a total of only 
five reports for the years from 
1906 to 1914. Then there is a 
complete absence of reports for 
the years 1915 to 1919, caused, 
no doubt, by the first World War. 
There is the same absence of re- 
ports for the years from 1939 to 
1949, caused by the second 
World War and its aftermath. No 
doubt quite a number of reports 
from those years do exist but, 
since they formed part of other- 
wise classified material, were 
never published. -And so far the 
collection is somewhat limited 
also to nationality. Reports from 
British vessels seem to be known 
more or less completely, thanks 
to The Marine Observer, and 
some reports from Dutch vessels 
have appeared in the Dutch ma- 
rine publication De Zee. Nobody, 
so far, has gone over the material 



that might be hiding in French 
and Portuguese publications. I 
expect the latter especially to 
yield much material because the 
sea route from Portugal to Goa 
went through the waters which 
are prone to produce the phe- 
nomenon. 

After the reports which were 
classified because of wartime, and 
the French and Portuguese re- 
ports, have been added to the 
material the seasonal statistics 
may look different. 

N OW for an attempt to explain 
all this. 

Before I give Dr. Kalle’s ex- 
planation I have to quote a sen- 
tence he wrote in the introduc- 
tory paragraph of his paper: “A 
definitive explanation of this 
natural phenomenon, which 
occurs at night and at sea in a 
surprising manner, tempting 
observers to think of cosmic or 
supernatural causes, does not yet 
exist.” The tentative explanation 
which is then advanced by Dr. 
Kalle is based on the known fact 
that luminescent marine organ- 
isms do not luminesce all the 
time. If they did, we would have 
phosphorescence all the time. But 
when the sea does phosphoresce 
it can clearly be seen that the 
organisms respond to physical 
stimuli. No captain of a sailing 
vessel ever produced as bright a 
wake as do the propellers of a 



112 



GALAXY 



steamer or motor ship. And if you 
stand in shallow water when 
there is phosphorescence you can 
produce an extra bright flash by 
the simple expedient of striking 
the surface with your outstretched 
hand. 

The small organisms — they 
are not actually microscopic, as 
one can read in many places, 
since the most common one 
measures about a millimeter in 
diameter — definitely respond 
to the shock wave produced by 
the blow on the surface. 

That they also seem to respond 
to something we don’t even feel 
is shown by the report of the 
ship’s master of the M. S. British

Premier (Nov. 30, 1951; location: 
southern portion of the Persian 
Gulf): “The ship’s radar appara- 
tus had been switched on with a 
view to checking her position, 
when, in the same instant this 
gear became operative, most 
brilliant boomerang-shaped arcs 
of phosphorescent light appeared 
in the sea, gyrating in a clock- 
wise direction to starboard and 
anticlockwise to port, but all 
sweeping inward toward the 
ship.” 

Now since the luminescence 
can be excited by a stimulus it is, 
as Captain Bradley of the Aristo 
pointed out, not necessary that 
the organisms themselves move 
rapidly. A rapidly moving stimu- 
lus would produce the same ap- 
pearance. Professor Kalle thinks 
that shock waves provide this 
stimulus, the shock waves them- 
selves being caused by submarine 
earthquakes. 

The rotating wheels, accord- 
ing to the same theory, might be 
caused by the interference of 
shock waves from two different 
sources, of which the second 
might be a reflection of the first. 
Dr. Kalle places some emphasis 
on this thought. 

The validity of the whole ex- 
planation depends on a rapid 
“lights on, lights off” of the organ- 
isms involved. If they, once stim- 
ulated, continue to luminesce for 
a few minutes, one would only 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



113 



get a generally luminous sea 
from seismic shock waves but no 
definite figures. So the next point 
of the investigation lies in the 
field of marine biology. First it 
has to be established just what 
organism, or organisms account 
for most of the phosphorescence 
in the areas involved. Then it has 
to be established whether they 
respond to shock waves, which 
offhand seems likely but may re- 
quire the presence of another con- 
dition. Finally it has to be estab- 
lished whether they “switch off” 
again quickly, so that the lumi- 
nescence lasts only for the dura- 
tion of being hit with the shock- 
wave. (A small time lag of half 
a second or so would be accept- 
able.) Once the answer to all 
three of these questions has been 
found to be yes, a mathematical 
analysis of the agreement or dis- 
agreement between observations 
and velocities of shockwaves un- 
der water could be undertaken. 

I have one more question in 
my mind: Has there ever been a 
naval battle at night in one of 
these areas? And did the shell 
splashes cause light waves, wheels 
and counter-wheels? 

If so, shouldn’t it be possible 
to produce a rotating wheel by 
means of underwater explosions 
. so that it does not come as a 
surprise but can be set off when 
everything is ready for its study?

A 

MATTER OF 
PROTOCOL 



By JACK SHARKEY Illustrated by SCHELLING 

■ 



"■ ^ROM space, the planet Vir- 
B-^ idian resembled a great 
B green moss-covered tennis 
ball. When the spaceship had 
arrowed even closer to the lush 
jungle that was the surface of the 
7000-mile sphere, there was still 
no visible break in the green cloak 
of the planet Even when they 
dipped almost below their margin 
of safety — spaceships were poorly 
built for extended flight within 
the atmosphere — it took nearly a 
complete circuit of the planet be- 
fore a triangle of emptiness was 
spotted. It was in the midst of 
the tangled canopy of treetops, 
themselves interwoven inextric- 
ably with coarse-leaved ropy 
vines that sprawled and coiled 



about the upthrust branches like 
underfed anacondas. 

Into the center of this triangle 
the ship was lowered on sputter- 
ing blue pillars of crackling en- 
ergy, to come to rest on the soft 
loamy earth. 

A bare instant after setdown, 
crewmen exploded from the air- 
lock and dashed into the jungle 
shadows with high-pressure tanks 
of gushing spume. Their job was 
to coat, cool and throttle the hun- 
gry fires trickling in bright orange 
fingers through the heat-black- 
ened grasses. Higher in the trees, 
a few vines smoldered fitfully 
where the fires had brushed them, 
then hissed into smoky wet ash 
as their own glutinous sap smoth-

ered the urgent embers. But the 
fire was going out. 

“Under control, sir,” reported a 
returning crewman. 

Lieutenant Jerry Norcriss 
emerged into the green gloaming 
that cloaked the base of the ship 
with a net of harlequin diamonds. 
Jerry nodded abstractedly as 
other crewmen laid a lightweight 
form-fitting couch alongside the 
tailfins near the airlock. On this 
couch Jerry reclined. Remaining 
crew members turned their fire- 
fighting gear over to companions 
and stood guard in a rough semi- 
circle with loaded rifles, their 
backs to the figure on the couch, 
facing the jungle and whatever 
predatory dangers it might hold. 

Ensign Bob Ryder, the techni- 
cian who had the much softer job 
of simply controlling and coor- 
dinating any information relayed 
by Jerry, leaned out through the 
open circle in the hull. 

“All set, sir,” said the tech. 
Jerry nodded and settled a heav- 
ily wired helmet onto his head, 
while Bob made a hookup be- 
tween the helmet and the power 
outlet that was concealed under 
a flap of metal on the tailfin. 

Helmet secured, Jerry lay back 
upon the couch and closed his 
eyes. “Any time you’re ready, 
Ensign.” 

Bob hurried back inside, found 
the panel he sought among the 
jumble of high-poWered machin- 



ery there, and placed a spool of 
microtape on a spindle inside it. 

He shut the panel and thumbed 
the button that started an im- 
pulse radiating from the tape into 
the jungle. 

The impulse had been detected 
and taped by a roborocket which 
had circled the planet for months 
before their arrival. It was one 
of the two Viridian species whose 
types were as yet uncatalogued by 
the Space Corps, in its vast files 
of alien life. Jerry’s job, as a 
Space Zoologist, was to complete 
those files, planet by planet 
throughout the spreading wave of 
slowly colonized universe. 

Bob made sure the tape was 
functioning. Then he clicked the 
switch that would stimulate the 
Contact center in Jerry’s brain 
and release his mind into that of 
the taped alien for an immutable 
forty minutes. 

Outside the ship, recumbent in 
the warm green-gold shadows, 
Jerry’s consciousness was dwarfed 
for an instant by a white light- 
ning-flash of energy. And then his 
body went limp as his mind 
sprang with thought-speed into 
Contact . 

J ERRY opened his eyes to a 
dizzying view of the dull 
brown jungle floor. He blinked a 
moment, then looked toward his 
feet. He saw two sets of thin 
knobby Vs, extending forward 



116 



GALAXY 



and partly around the tiny limb 
he stood upon, their chitinous sur- 
face shiny with the wetness of the 
jungle air. 

Slowly working his jaws, he 
heard the extremely gentle “click” 
as they came together. The endo- 
skeleton must exist all over his 
host’s body. 

After making certain it would 
not disturb his balance on the 
limb, he attempted bringing what- 
ever on the alien passed for hands 
before his face. 

Sometimes aliens had no 
hands, nor any comparable or- 
ganisms. Then Jerry would have 
to soft-pedal the mental nagging 
of being “amputated,” an unavoid- 
able carryover from his subcon- 
scious “wrong-feeling” about arm- 
lessness. 

But this time the effort moved 
up multi-jointed limbs, spindly as 
a cat’s whiskers, terminating in a 
perpetually coiling soft prehensile 
tip. He tried feeling along his tor- 
so to determine its size and shape. 
But the wormlike tips were tac- 
tilely insensitive. 

Hoping to deduce his shape 
from his shadow, he inched side- 
ways along the limb on those in- 
adequate-looking two-pronged 
feet toward a blob of yellow sun- 
light nearer the trunk. 

The silhouette on the branch 
showed him a stubby cigar- 
shaped torso. 

“I seem to be a semi-tentacled 



no-hop grasshopper,” he mused to 
himself, vainly trying to turn his 
head on his neck. “Head, thorax 
and abdomen all one piece.” 

He tried flexing what would be, 
in a man, the region of the shoul- 
derblades. He was rewarded by 
the appearance of long, narrow 
wings — two sets of them, like a 
dragonfly’s — from beneath two 
flaps of chitin on his back. 

He tried an experimental flap- 
ping. The pair of wings — white 
and stiff like starched tissue 
paper, not veinous as in Earth- 
insects — dissolved in a buzzing 
blur of motion. The limb fell 
away from under his tiny V- 
shaped feet. And then he was up 
above the blinding green blanket 
of jungle treetops, his shadow 
pacing his forward movement 
along the close-packed quilt of 
wide leaves below. 

“I’d better be careful,” thought 
Jerry. “There may be avian life 
here that considers my species the 
piece de resistance of the pteroid 
set ...” 

Slowing his rapid wingbeat, he 
let himself drop down toward the 
nearest mattress-sized leaf. He 
folded his out-thrust feet in mid- 
air and dropped the last few 
inches to a cushiony rest. 

A SLIGHT shimmer of dizzi- 
•**- ness gripped his mind. 

Perhaps the “skull” of this crea- 
ture was ill-equipped to ward off 



A MATTER OF PROTOCOL 



117 






the hot rays of the tropic sunlight. 
Lest his brain be fried in its own 
casing, Jerry scuttled along the 
velvet top of the leaf, and ducked 
quickly beneath its nearest over- 
lapping companion. The wave of 
vertigo passed quickly, there in 
the deep shadow. Under the can- 
opy of leaves Jerry crawled back 
to a limb near the top of the tree. 

A few feet from where he stood, 
something moved. 

Jerry turned that way. Another 
creature of the same species was 
balancing lightly on a green limb 
of wire-thickness, its gaze fixed 
steadily toward the jungle floor- 
ing, as Jerry’s own had been on 
entering the alien body. 

Watching out for predators? 
Or for victims? 

He could, he knew, pull his con- 
sciousness back enough to let the 
creature’s own consciousness car- 
ry it through its daily cycle of eat- 
ing, avoiding destruction, and the 
manifold businesses of being an 
ambient creature. But he decided 
to keep control. It would be easier 
to figure out his host’s ecological 
status in the planet’s natural life- 
balance by observing the other 
one for awhile. 

Jerry always felt more com- 
fortable when he was in full con- 
trol. You never knew when an 
alien might stupidly stumble into 
a fatality that any intelligent 
mind could easily have avoided. 

Idly, as he watched his fellow 



creature down near the inner part 
of the branch, he wondered how 
much more time he would be in 
Contact. Subjectively he’d 
seemed to be enhosted for about 
ten minutes. But one of the draw- 
backs of Contact was the subju- 
gation of personal time-sense to 
that of the host. Depending on the 
species he enhosted, the forty- 
minute Contact period could be 
an eternity, or the blink of an 
eye . 

IVTOTHING further seemed to 

” be occurring. Jerry reluc- 
tantly withdrew some of his con- 
trol from the insect-mind to see 
what would happen. 

Immediately it inched forward 
until it was in the same position 
it had been in when Jerry made 
Contact: V-shaped feet forward 
and slightly around the narrow 
branch, eyes fixed upon the 
brownish jungle floor, body mo- 
tionless with folded wings. For 
awhile, Jerry tried “listening” to 
.its mind, but received no read- 
able thoughts. Only a sense of 
imminence ... Of patience ... Of 
waiting . 

It didn’t take long for Jerry to 
grow bored with this near-mind- 
less outlook. He reassumed full 
control. Guiding the fragile feet 
carefully along the branch, he 
made his way to his fellow watch- 
er, and tried out the creature’s 
communication system. His mind 



118 



GALAXY 



B 

strove to activate something on 
the order of a larynx; the insect’s 
nervous system received this im- 
pulse, changed in inter-species 
translation, as a broad request for 
getting a message to its fellow. Its 
body responded by lifting the 
multi-jointed “arms” forward. It 
clapped the hard inner surfaces of 
the “wrists” together so fast that 
they blurred into invisibility as 
the wings had done. 

A thin, ratchetty sound came 
, forth from that hardshell contact. 
The other insect looked up in 
annoyance, then returned its gaze 
to the ground again. 

Aural conversation thus obvi- 
ated, Jerry tried for physical at- 
tention-getting. He reached out a 
vermiform forelimb-tip and 
tugged urgently at the other in- 
sect’s nearest hind leg. An angry 
movement gave out the unmis- 
takeable pantomimic message: 
“For pete’s sake, get off my back! 
I’m busyl” The other insect 
spread its thin double wings and 
went buzzing off a few trees away, 
then settled on a limb there and 
took up its earthward vigil once 
more. 

“Well, they’re not gregarious, 
that’s for sure,” said Jerry to him- 
self. “I wish I knew what the hell 
we were waiting for!” 

He decided he was sick of 
ground-watching, and turned his 
attention to his immediate vicin- 
ity. His gaze wandered along all 



the twists, juts and thrusts of 
branch and vine beneath the sun- 
blocking leaves. 

And all at once he realized he 
was staring at another of his kind. 
So still had its dull green-brown 
body been that he’d taken it for a 
ripple of bark along a branch. 

Carefully, -he looked further on. 
Beyond the small still figure he 
soon located another like it, and 
then another. Within a short 
space of time, he had found three 
dozen of the insects sitting silent- 
ly around him in a spherical area 
barely ten feet in diameter. 

/"|DDLY disconcerted, he once 
more spread his stiff white 
wings and fluttered away through 
the treetops, careful to avoid 
coming out in direct sunlight this 
time. 

He flew until a resurgence of 
giddiness told him he was over- 
straining the creature’s stamina. 
He dropped onto a limb and 
looked about once more. Within 
a very short time, he had spotted 
dozens more of the grasshopper- 
things. All were the same, sitting 
in camouflaged silence, steadily 
eyeing the ground. 

“Damn,” thought Jerry. “They 
don’t seem interested in eating, 
mating or fighting. All they want 
to do is sit — sit and wait. But 
what are they waiting for?” 

There was, of course, the possi- 
bility that he’d caught them in an 



A MATTER OF PROTOCOL 



119 



off-period. If the species were noc- 
turnal, then he wouldn’t get any 
action from them till after sunset. 
That, he realized gloomily, meant 
a re-Contact later on. One way or 
another, he would have to deter- 
mine the functions, capabilities 
and menace — if any — of the 
species with regard to the influx 
of colonists, who would come to 
Viridian only if his report pro- 
nounced it safe. 

Once again, he let the insect’s 
mind take over. Again that over- 
powering feeling of imminence . 

He was irritated. It couldn’t 
just be looking forward to night- 
fall! There were too many things 
tied in with the imminence feel- 
ing: the necessity for quiet, for 
motionlessness, for careful watch- 
ing. 

The more he thought on it, the 
more had the distinct intuition 
that it would sit and stare at the 
soft, mulch-covered jungle floor, 
be it bright daylight or blackest 
gloom, waiting, and waiting, and 
waiting . 

Then, suddenly, the slight feel 
of imminence became almost un- 
bearable apprehension. 

The change in intensity was 
due to a soft, cautious shuffling 
sound from down in the green- 
gold twilight Something was 
coming through the jungle. Some- 
thing that moved on careful feet 
along the springy, moist brown 
surface below the trees. 



Far below, a shadow detached 
itself slowly from the deeper 
shadows of the trees, and a form 
began to emerge into the wan ffl. 
tered sunlight. It — 

An all-encompassing lance of 
silent white lightning. Contact 
was over . 

Jerry sat up on the couch, 
angry. He pulled the helmet off 
his head as Bob Ryder leaned out 
the airlock once more. “How’d it 
go, sir?” 

“Lousy. I’ll have to re-establish. 
Didn’t have time to Learn it suffi- 
ciently.” A slight expression of 
disappointment on the tech’s face 
made him add, “Don’t tell me you 
have the other tape in place al- 
ready?” 

“Sorry,” Bob said. “You usually 
do a complete Learning in one 
Contact.” 

“Oh — ” Jerry shrugged and 
reached for the helmet again. 
“Never mind, I’ll take on the 
second alien long as it’s, already 
set up. I may just have hit the 
first one in an off-period. The de- 
lay in re-Contact may be just 
what I need to catch it in action.” 

Settling the helmet snugly on 
his head once more, he leaned 
back onto the couch and waited. 
He heard the tech’s feet clanking 
along the metal plates inside the 
ship, then the soft clang of an • 
opening door in the power room, 
and — 



120 



GALAXY 



■ 

Whiteness, writhing electric 
whiteness and cold silence. And 
he was in Contact. 

D arkness, and musky 

warmth. 

Then a slot of light appeared, 
a thin fuzzy line of yellow striped 
with spiky green. Jerry had time, 
in the brief flicker, to observe 
thick bearlike forelimbs holding 
up a squarish trapdoor fastened 
with cross-twigs for support. Then 
the powerful forepaws let the 
door drop back into place, and it 
was dark again. 

He hadn’t liked those forepaws. 
Though thick as and pawed like 
a bear’s, they were devoid of 
hair. They had skin thin as a 
caterpillar’s, a mottled pink with 
sick-looking areas of deathly 
white. 

Skin like that would be a push- 
over to actinic rays for any long 
exposure. Probably the thing 
lived underground here, almost 
permanently. His eyes had de- 
tected a rude assortment of thick 
wooden limbs curving in and out 
at regular intervals in the vertical 
wall of soil that was the end of 
this tunnel, just below the trap- 
door. Tree roots. But formed, by 
some odd natural quirk, into a 
utile ladder. 

But why had the thing peered 
out, then dropped the door to 
wait? Did every species on this 
planet hang around expectantly 



and nothing else? And what was 
the waiting for? 

Then he felt the urge within 
the creature, the urge to scurry 
up that ladder into the light. But 
there was, simultaneously, a coun- 
ter-urge in the thing, telling it to 
please wait a little longer . 

Jerry recognized the urge by 
quick anthropomorphosis. It was 
the goofy urge. The crazy urge. 
Like one gets on the brinks of 
awesome heights, or on subway 
platforms as the train roars in: 
The impulsive urge to self-de- 
struction, so swiftly frightening 
and so swiftly suppressed . 

Yet, it had lifted and dropped 
that lid too briefly to have seen 
anything outside. Could it be lis- 
tening for something? Carefully, 
he relinquished his control of the 
beast, fraction by fraction, to see 
what it would do. 

It rose on tiptoe at once, and 
again lifted that earthen door. 

It squinted at the profusion of 
green-yellow sunlight that stung 
its eyes. Then it rose on powerful 
hind limbs and clambered just 
high enough on that “ladder” to 
see over the grassy rim of the 
trapdoor-hole. Jerry then heard 
the soft shuffling sound that had 
re-alerted it, and saw the source. 

Out on the matted brown 
jungle flooring, beneath the tow- 
ering trees, another of the bear- 
things was moving forward from 
an open turf-door, emitting low, 



A MATTER OF PROTOCOL 



121 



whimpering snorts as it inched 
along through the dappling yellow 
sunlight. 

Obviously it was following that 
manic-destruction impulse that he 
just felt and managed to suppress. 
It must have been almost a hun- 
dred degrees out there. And the 
damned thing was shivering. 

TTERE and there, Jerry noticed 
suddenly, other half-opened 
trapdoors were framing other 
bear-things’ heads. The air was 
taut with electric tension, the ten- 
sion of a slow trigger-squeeze that 
moves millimeter by millimeter 
toward the instant explosion . 

The soft shuffling sounds of the 
animal’s movement jogged Jerry’s 
memory then, and he knew it for 
the sound he had heard when en- 
hosted in the grasshopper-thing. 
Was a bear-thing what they’d 
been waiting in the trees so 
silently for? And what would be 
the culmination of that vigil? 

Then the bear-thing he was in 
Contact with hitched itself up 
another root-rung. Jerry saw the 
thing toward which the quaking 
creature was headed, in a 
hunched crawl, its whimpers more 
anguished by the moment. 

Pendant in the green gloaming, 
about four feet above the spongy 
brown jungle floor, hung a thick 
yellow-gray gourd at the tip of a 
long vine. Its sides glittered stick- 
ily with condensed moisture that 



mingled with the effluvium of the 
gourd itself. The odor was both 
noisome and compelling, power- 
ful as a bushel of rotting roses. It 
sickened as it lured, teased the 
nostrils as it cloyed within the 
lungs. 

To this dangling obscenity the 
bear-thing moved. Its eyes were 
no longer afraid, but glazed and 
dulled by the strength of that 
musky lure. Its movements were 
fluid and trancelike. 

It arose on sturdy hind limbs 
and struck at the gourd with a 
gentle paw, sending it jouncing to 
one side on its long green vine. As 
it bobbed back, the creature 
struck it off in the opposite direc- 
tion with a sharper blow. 

Jerry watched in fascination. 
The gourd swung faster; the 
mottled pink-white alien creature 
swayed and wove its forelimbs 
and thick body in a ritual dance 
matching the tempo of the arcing 
gourd. 

Then Jerry noted that the vine 
was unlike earth-vines which 
parasitically employ treetops as 
their unwilling trellises. It is a 
limp extension of the tip of a tree 
branch itself. So were all the 
other vines in that green matting 
overhead. 

A RIPPING sound yanked his 
gaze back to the dazed crea- 
ture and the gourd again. 

A ragged tear had riven the 



A MATTER OF PROTOCOL 



123 



I 



side of the gourd. Tiny coils of 
green were dribbling out in 
batches, like watchsprings spilled 
from a paper bag. They struck 
with a bounce and wriggle on the 
resilient brown mulch. And then, 
as they straightened themselves, 
Jerry knew them for what they 
were: Miniature versions of the 
grasshopper-things, shaped pre- 
cisely like the adults, but only a 
third as large. 

The bear-thing’s movements 
had gone from graceful fluidity to 
frenzy now. A loud whistle of 
fright escaped it as the last of the 
twitching green things flopped 
from its vegetable coccoon, 
whirred white wings to dry them 
and flew off. 

And the lumbering creature 
had reason for its fright. 

The instant the last coil of 
wiggly green life was a vanishing 
blur in the green shadows, a cloud 
of darker green descended upon 
the pink form of the beast from 
the trees. 

The grasshopper-things were 
waiting no longer. Thousands 
swarmed on the writhing form, 
until the bear-thing was a lumpy 
green parody of itself. 

As quickly as the cloud had 
plunged and clustered, it fell 
away. The earth was teeming 
with the flip-flopping forms of dy- 
ing insects, white wings going 
dark brown and curling like cello- 
phane in open flame. The bear- 



thing itself was no longer recog- 
nizable, its flesh a myriad egg-like 
white lumps. It swayed in agony 
for a moment, then toppled. 

Instantly the other creatures — 
his host with them — were racing 
forward to the site of the encoun- 
ter. Jerry felt his host’s long gum- 
my tongue flick out and snare one 
— just one — of the dead adult in- 
sects. It was ingested whole by a 
deft backflip of tongue to gullet. 
As his host turned tail and scur- 
ried for the tunnel once more, 
Jerry swiftly took control again, 
and halted it to observe any fur- 
ther developments. 

"t' ACH of the other things, after 
a one-insect gulp, was just 
vanishing back underground. The 
turf-tops were dropping neatly in- 
to almost undetectable place hid- 
ing the tunnels. The sunlight 
nipped at his pale flesh, but Jerry 
held off from a return to the un- 
derground sanctuary, still watch- 
ing that lump-covered corpse on 
the earth. Then . 

The vine, its burden gone, be- 
gan to drip a thick ichor from its 
ragged end upon the dead animal 
beneath it. 

And as the ichor touched upon 
a white lump, the lump would 
swell, wriggle, and change color. 
Jerry watched with awe as the 
color became a mottled pink, and 
the surface of the lumps cracked 
and shriveled away, and tiny 



124 



GALAXY 



forms plopped out onto the 
ground: miniature bear-things, 

tiny throats emitting eager 
mouse-squeaks of hunger. 

They rushed upon the body in 
which they’d been so violently in- 
cubated and swiftly, systematic- 
ally devoured it, blood, bone and 
sinew. 

And when not even a memory 
of the dead beast was left upon 
the soil, the tiny pink-white 
things began to burrow downward 
into the ground. Soon there was 
nothing left in the area but a 
dried fragment of vine, a few 
loose mounds of soil and a vast 
silence. 

“I’ll be a monkey’s uncle!” said 
Jerry . forgetting in his excite- 
ment that this phrase was nearly 
a concise parody of the Space 
Zoologists’ final oath of duty, and 
kiddingly used as such by the 
older members of the group. 

The whole damned planet was 
symbiotic! After witnessing those 
alien life-death rites, it didn’t take 
him long to figure out the screw- 
ball connections between the spe- 
cies. Insects, once born of vine- 
gourds and fully grown, then 
propagated their species by a 
strange means: laying bear-eggs 
in a bear- thing and dying. And 
dying, eaten by the surviving 
bears, they turned to seeds which 
— left in the tunnels by the bear- 
things as droppings — in turn took 
root and became trees. 



And the trees, under the on- 
slaught of another bear-thing on a 
dangling pod, would produce new 
insects, then drip its ichor to fer- 
tilize the eggs in the newly dead 
bear-thing . 

Jerry found his mind tangling 
as he attempted a better pinpoint- 
ing of the plant-animal-insect re- 
lationship. A dead adult insect, 
plus a trip through a bear-thing’s 
alimentary canal, produced a tree. 
A tree-pod, with the swatting 
stimulus of a bear-thing’s paws, 
gave birth to new insects. And in- 
sect eggs in animal flesh, stimu- 
lated by the tree-ichor, gestated 
swiftly into young animals . 

That meant, simply, that insect 
plus bear equals tree, tree plus 
bear equals insect, and insect plus 
tree equals bear. With three sys- 
tems, each relied on the non-inclu- 
sive member for the breeding- 
ground. Insect-plus-ichor produced 
small animals in the animal flesh. 
Dead-insect-plus-bear produced 
tree in the tree-flesh (if one con- 
sidered dead tree leaves and bark 
and such as the makeup of the 
soil.) Bear-swats-plus-tree pro- 
duced insects . “Damn,” said 
Jerry to himself, “but not in the 
insect-flesh. The thing won’t 
round off . .” 

He tried again, thinking hard. 
In effect, the trees were parents 
to the insects, insects parents to 
the bears, and bears parents to 
the trees . Though in another 



A MATTER OF PROTOCOL 



125 



sense, bear-flesh gave birth to new 
bears, digested insects gave birth 
(through the tree-medium) to 
new insects, and trees (through 
the insect-medium) gave birth to 
new trees . 

Jerry’s head spun pleasantly as 
he tried vainly to solve the confu- 
sion. Men of science, he realized, 
would spend decades trying to 
figure out which species were re- 
sponsible for which. It made the 
ancient chicken-or-egg question 
beneath consideration. And a lot 
of diehard evolutionists were go- 
ing to be bedded down with 
severe migraines when his report 
went into circulation . 

A dazzle of silent lightning, and 
Contact was over. 

66TJEADY with that first tape 
again,” Bob Ryder said as 
Jerry removed the Contact hel- 
met and brushed his snow-white 
hair back from his tanned, youth.- 
ful face. “Or do you want a 
breather first?” 

Jerry shook his head. “I won’t 
need to re-Contact that other spe- 
cies, Ensign. I got its life-relation 
ships from the second Contact.” 

“Really, sir?” said Bob. “That’s 
pretty unusual, isn’t it?” 

“The whole damned planet’s 
unusual,” said Jerry, rising from 
his supine position and stretching 
luxuriously in the warm jungle 
air. “You’ll see what I mean when 
you process the second tape.” 



Bob decided that Jerry — run- 
ning pretty true to form for a 
Space Zoologist — wasn’t in a par- 
ticularly talkative mood, so he 
had to satisfy himself with wait- 
ing for the transcription of the 
Contact to get the details. 

Later that day, an hour after 
takeoff, with Viridian already 
vanished behind them as the 
great ship plowed through hyper- 
space toward Earth and home, 
Bob finished reading the report. 
Then he went down the passage- 
way to the ward room for coffee. 
Jerry was seated there already. 
Bob, quickly filling a mug from 
the polished percolator, slid into 
a seat across the table from his 
superior and asked the question 
that had been bugging him since 
seeing the report. 

“Sir — on that second Contact. 
Has it occurred to you that you’d 
relinquished control to the host 
before you saw that other crea- 
ture move out and start swatting 
the gourd-thing?” 

“You mean was I taking a 
chance on being destroyed in the 
host if the creature I was Contact- 
ing gave in to the urge to do the 
swatting?” 

“Yes, sir,” said Bob. “I mean, I 
know you can take control any 
time, if things get dangerous. But 
wasn’t that cutting it kind of 
thin?” 

Jerry shook his head and sip- 
ped his coffee. “Wrong urge, En- 



126 



GALAXY 



sign. You’ll note I recognized it 
as the goofy urge, the impulse to 
die followed instantly by a vio- 
lent surge of self-preservation. It 
wasn’t the death-wish at all. My- 
self and the creatures who re- 
mained safely at the tunnel- 
mouths had a milder form of what 
was affecting the creature that did 
start swatting the gourd.” 

“Then what was the difference, 
sir? Why did that one particular 
creature get the full self-destruc- 
tion urge and no other?” 

Jerry wrinkled his face in 
thought. “I wish I didn’t suspect 
the answer to that, Ensign. The 
only thing I hope it isn’t is the 
thing I have the strongest inkling 
it is: Rotation. Something in their 
biology has set them up in a cer- 
tain order for destruction. And 
that rite I saw performed was so 
un-animal, so formalized — ” 

Bob’s eyes widened as he 
caught the inference. “You think 
they have an inbuilt protocol? 
That if one particular creature 
missed its cue, somehow, the 
designated subsequent creature 
would simply wait forever, never 
jumping its turn?” 

“That’s what I mean,” nodded 
Jerry. “I hope I’m wrong.” 

“But the right creature made 
it,” said Bob, blinking. “We can’t 
have upset the ecology, can we?” 
“Things develop fast on Viridi- 
an,” mused Jerry. “If I figure the 
time-relationship between their 



egg-hatching rate and growth rate, 
those trees must mature in growth 
in about a month. And we man- 
aged to shrivel a half dozen vines 
with our rocket fires when we 
landed, and probably that many 
again when we blasted off ... ” 

“We dropped CO2 bombs after 
we cleared the trees,” offered the 
tech, uneasily. “The fire was out 
in seconds.” 

“That wouldn’t help an al- 
ready-shriveled vine, though, now 
would it!” sighed Jerry. “And if 
my hunch about protocol is cor- 
rect — ” 

“The life-cycle would inter- 
rupt?” gasped the tech. 

“We’ll see,” said Jerry. “It’ll 
take us a month to get back, and 
there’ll be another six months be- 
fore the first wave of engineers is 
sent to begin the homesteads and 
industry sites We’ll see. Ensign.” 

TT took two months for the engi- 
neers to go out and return. 

They hadn’t landed. A few or- 
bits about the planet had shown 
them nothing but a vast dead ball 
of dust and rotted vegetation, 
totally unfit for human habitation. 
They brought back photographs 
taken of the dead planet that no 
longer deserved the name it had 
rated in life. 

But Jerry Norcriss, Space Zool- 
ogist, made it a special point to 
avoid looking at any of them.

PORTRAITS 

AND 

A 

PRAYER 



Howard Chandler Christy: 
The Lovely Young Girl 

WW7TIEN Dr. Rhine Cooperstock 
” was put under my care I 
was enlarged with pride. Dr. 
Cooperstock was a hero to me. I 
don’t mean a George Washington, 
all virtue and no fire, I mean he 
was a dragon killer. He had 
carried human knowledge far into 
the tiny spaces of an atomic 
nucleus. He was a very great man. 
And I was his doctor and he was 
dying. 

Dr. Cooperstock was dying in 
the finest suite in the Morgan 
Pavilion and with all the best 
doctors. (I am not modest.) We 
couldn’t keep him alive for more 
than a matter of months, and we 
couldn’t cure him at all. But we 
could make him comfortable. If 
round-the-clock nurses and color 
television constitute comfort. 

I don’t ask you to understand 
technical medical terms. He was 
an old man, his blood vessels de- 
teriorating, and clots formed, 
impeding the circulation. One day 
a clot would form in heart, brain 
or lungs and he would die. If it 
was in the lung it would be pain- 
ful and slow. In the heart, painful 
and fast. In the brain most pain- 
ful of all, but so fast that it would 
be a mercy. 

Meanwhile we fed him heparin 
and sometimes coumarol and 
attempted by massages and heat

and diet to stave off the end. 
Although, in fact, he was all but 
dead anyway, so little freedom of 
movement we allowed him. 

“Martin, the leg hurts. You’d 
better leave a pill,” he would say 
to me once or twice a week, and 
I would hesitate. “I don’t know 
if I can make it to the bathroom 
tonight, Martin,” he would say, his 
tone cheerfully resigned. Then he 
would call for the bedpan while 
I was there, or mention casually 
that some invisible wrinkle in the 
sheet caused him pain and stand 
by bravely while the bed was re- 
made, and say at last, self-de- 
precating, “I think I will need that 
pill, Martin.” So I would allow 
myself to be persuaded and let 
him have a red-and-white capsule 
and in the morning it would be 
gone. I never told him that they 
contained only aspirin and he 
never admitted to me that he did 
not take the pills at all but was 
laboriously building up a hoard 
against the day when the pain 
would be really serious and he 
would take them all at once. 

Dr. Cooperstock knew the leth- 
al dose as well as I did. As he 
knew the names of all his veins 
and arteries and the chemistry of 
his disease. A man like Rhine 
Cooperstock, even at seventy, can 
learn enough medicine for that in 
a week. * 

He acquired eleven of the little 
capsules in one month at the 




Pavilion; I know, because i 
counted them after he left. That 
would have been enough for sui- 
cide, if they had not been aspirin. 
I suppose he would have stopped 
there, perhaps beginning to take 
a few, now and then, both to keep 
me from getting suspicious and 
for the relief of the real pain he 
must have felt. But he did leave. 
Nan Halloran came and got him. 

She invaded the Pavilion like 
a queen. Expensive, celebrated 
hospital, we were used to the 
famous; but this was Nan Hallor- 
an, blue-eyed, black-haired, a face 
like a lovely child and a voice like 
the sway of hips. She was a most 
remarkable woman. I called her 
a queen, but she was not that, she 
was a goddess, virgin and fertile. 
I speak subjectively, of course, 
for in medical fact she was surely 
not one and may not have been 
either. She breezed into the room, 
wrinkling her nose. “Coopie,” she 
said, “What is that awful smell? 
Will you do me a favor, dear? I 
need it very much.” 

You would not think that a 
man like Dr. Cooperstock would 
have much to do with a television 
star; but he knew her; years be- 
fore, when he was still teaching 
sometimes, she had somehow 
wandered into his class. “Hello, 
Nan,” he said, looking quite as- 
tonished and pleased. “I’ll do any- 
thing I can for you, of course. 
That smell,” he apologized, touch-

ing the leg with its bright spots 
of color and degenerated tissues, 
“is me.” 

“Poor Coopie.” She looked 
around at me and smiled. Al- 
though I am fat and not attractive 
and know in my heart that, what- 
ever long-term wonders I may 
work with the brilliance of my 
mind and the cleverness of my 
speech, no woman will ever lust 
for me on sight, I tingled. I looked 
away. She said sweetly, “It’s about 
that fusion power thing, Coopie. 
You know Wayne Donner, of 
course? He and I are good 
friends. He has these utility com- 
pany interests, and he wants to 
convert them to fusion power, and 
I told him you were the only man 
who could help him.” 

Dr. Cooperstock began to 
laugh, and laughed until he was 
choking and gagging. I laughed 
too, although I think that in all 
the world Dr. Cooperstock and I 
must be two of the very few men 
who would laugh at the name of 
Wayne Donner. “Nan,” he said 
when he could, “you’re amazing.. 
It’s utterly impossible, I’m afraid.” 

CHE sat on the edge of his bed 
^ with a rustle of petticoats. She 
had lovely legs. “Oh, did that hurt 
you? But I didn’t even touch your 
leg, dear. Would you please get 
up and come now, because the 
driver’s waiting?” 

“Nan!” he cried. “Security reg- 



ulations. Death. Lack of proper 
engineering! Did you ever think 
of any of those things? And 
they’re only a beginning.” 

“If you’re going to make objec- 
tions we’ll be here all day, darling. 
As far as security is concerned,” 
she said, “this is for the peaceful 
use of atomic power, isn’t it? I 
promise you that Wayne has 
enough friends in the Senate that 
there will be no problem. And the 
engineering’s all right, because 
Wayne has all those people al- 
ready, of course. This isn’t any 
little Manhattan Project, honey. 
Wayne spends money.” 

Dr. Cooperstock shook his head 
and, although he was smiling, he 
was interested, too. “What about 
death, Nan?” he said gently. 

“Oh, I know, Coopie. It’s ter- 
rible. But you can’t lick this 
thing. So won’t you do it for me? 
Wayne only needs you for a few 
weeks and he already talked to 
some doctors. They said it would 
be all right.” 

“Miss Halloran,” I said. I admit 
I was furious. “Dr. Cooperstock is 
my patient. As long as that is so, 
I will decide what is or is not all 
right.” 

She looked at me again, sweetly 
and attentively. 

I have now and had then no 
doubt at all; I was absolutely 
right in my position. Yet I felt as 
though I had committed the act 
of a clumsy fool. She was clean 



THREE PORTRAITS AND APRAYER 



131 



and lovely, her neck so slim that 
the dress she wore seemed too 
large for her, like an adorable 
child’s. She was no child , I knew 
that she had had a hundred 
lovers because everyone knows 
that, even doctors who are fat and 
a little ugly and take it all out in 
intelligence. Yet she possessed an 
innocence I could not withstand. 
I wanted to take her sweetly by 
the hand and shelter her, and 
walk with her beside a brook and 
then that night crush her and 
caress her again and again with 
such violence and snorting pas- 
sion that she would Awaken and 
then, with growing abandon, Re- 
spond. I did know it was all fool- 
ishness. I did. But when she 
mentioned the names of five or six 
doctors on Donner’s payroll who 
would care for Dr. Cooperstock 
and suggested like a child that 
with them in charge it would 
really be all right, I agreed. I even 
apologized. Truth to tell, they 
were excellent men, those doctors. 
But if she had named six chiro- 
practors and an unfrocked abor- 
tionist I still would have shrugged 
and shuffled and stammered, “Oh, 
well, I suppose, Miss Halloran, 
yes, it will be all right.” 

So we called the nurses in and 
very carefully dressed the old 
man and wheeled him out into the 
hall. I said something else that 
was foolish in the elevator. I said, 
because I had assumed that it 



was so, that she probably had a 
cab waiting and a cab would not 
do to transport a man as sick as 
Dr. Cooperstock. But she had 
been more sure of herself than 
that. The driver who was waiting 
was at the wheel of a private 
ambulance. 

A TIME cover, 
attributed to Artzybasheff, 
with mosaic of dollar signs. 

T DID not again hear of Dr. 

Cooperstock for five weeks. 
Then I was telephoned to come 
and get him, for he was ready to 
return to the Pavilion to die. It 
was Wayne Donner himself who 
called me. 

I agreed to come to one of 
Donner’s New York offices to 
meet him, for in truth I was curi- 
ous. I knew all about him, of 
course — rather, I knew as much 
as he wished anyone to know. I 
have seen enough of the world’s 
household names in the Pavilion 
to know what their public rela- 
tions men can do. The facts that 
were on record about Wayne 
Donner were that he was very 
rich. He had gone from a lucky 
strike in oil and the twenty-seven 
and a half per cent depletion al- 
lowance to aluminum. And thence 
to electric power. He was almost 
the wealthiest man in the world, 
and I know his secret. 

He could afford anything, any- 



132 



GALAXY 



thing at all, because he had 
schooled himself to purchase only 
bargains. For example, I knew 
that he was Nan Halloran’s lover 
and, although I do not know her 
price, I know that it was what he 
was willing to pay. Otherwise he 
would have given her that thin, 
bright smile that meant the parley 
was over, there would be no con- 
tract signed that day, and gone on 
to another incredible beauty more 
modest in her bargaining. Donner 
allowed himself to want only what 
he could get. I think he was the 
only terrible man I have ever 
seen. And he had nearly been 
President of the United States! 
Except that Governor Hewlett of 
Ohio spoke so honestly and so 
truthfully about him in the pri- 
maries that not all of Donner’s 
newspapers could get him the 
vote; what was terrible was not 
that he then destroyed Hewlett, 
but that Hewlett was not de- 
stroyed for revenge. Donner 
hated too deeply to be satisfied 
with revenge, I think; he was too 
contemptuous of his enemies to 
trouble to crush them. He would 
not give them that satisfaction. 
Hewlett was blotted out only in- 
cidentally. Because Donner’s 
papers had built the campaign 
against him to such a pitch that 
it was actually selling papers, and 
thus it was profitable to go on to 
ruin the man. When I saw Donner 
he had Hewlett’s picture framed 



in gilt in his waiting room. I won- 
dered how many of his visitors 
understood the message. For that 
matter I wondered how many 
needed it. 

When I was admitted, Dr. 
Cooperstock was on a relaxing 
couch. “Hello, Martin,” he said 
over the little drone of its motor. 
“This is Wayne Donner. Dr. 
Finneman. Dr. Grace.” 

I shook hands with the doctors 
first, pettishly enough but I felt 
obliged to show where I stood, 
and then with Donner. He .was 
very courteous. He had discov- 
ered what bargains could be 
bought with that coin too. He 
said, “Dr. Finneman here has a 
good deal of respect for you, Doc- 
tor. I’m sure you’re well placed at 
the Pavilion. But if you ever con- 
sider leaving I’d like to talk to 
you.” 

I thanked him and refused. I 
was flattered, though. I thought 
of how his fusion-power nonsense 
might have killed Dr. Cooperstock 
before he was ready to die, and 
I thought of him with Nan Hallor- 
an, sweat on that perfect face. And 
I am not impressed by money. 

Yet I was flattered that he 
would take the trouble and time, 
and God knows how much an 
hour of his time was worth, to 
himself offer me a job. I was flat- 
tered even though I knew that the 
courtesy was for his benefit, not 
mine. He wanted the best he 



THREE PORTRAITS AND APRAYER 



133 






chose to afford — in the way of a 
doctor, in my case, but the best 
of anything else too. If he hired a 
gardener he would want the man 
to be a very good gardener. Aware 
as he was of the dignities assumed 
by a professional man, he had 
budgeted the time to give me a 
personal invitation instead of let- 
ting his housekeeper or general 
manager attend to it. It was only 
another installment of expense he 
chose to afford and yet I was glad 
to get out of there. I was almost 
afraid I would reconsider and say 
yes, and I hated that man very 
much. 

TV7HEN we got Dr. Cooperstock 
” back and bedded and 
checked over I examined the rec- 
ords Dr. Finneman had sent. He 
had furnished complete tests and 
a politely guarded prognosis, and 
of course he was right; Cooper- 
stock was sinking, but not fast; he 
was good for another month or 
two with luck. I told him as much, 
snappishly. “Don’t be angry with 
me, Martin,” he said, “you’d have 
done the same thing for Nan if 
she asked you.” 

“Probably, but I’m not dying.” 

“Don’t be vulgar, Martin.” 

“I’m not a nuclear physicist, 
either.” 

“It’s only to make a few dollars 
for the man, Martin. Heavens. 
What difference can another bil- 
lion or two make to Donner? Be- 



sides,” he said strongly, “you 
know I’ve always opposed this 
fetish of security. Think of Oppen- 
heimer, not allowed to read his 
own papers! Think of the waste, 
the same work done in a dozen 
different places, because in Irku- 
tsk they aren’t allowed to know 
what’s going on in Denver and in 
Omaha somebody forgot to tell 
them.” 

“Think of Wayne Donner with 
all the power in the world,” I said. 

He said, “I guess Nan hit you 
harder than I thought, to make 
you so mad.” 

Although I watched the papers 
I did not see anything about con- 
verting Donner’s power stations 
to fusion energy. In fact, I didn’t 
see much of Donner’s name at all, 
which caused me to wonder. Nor- 
mally he would have been spotted 
in the Stork or cruising off Bimini 
or in some other way photo- 
graphed and written about a 
couple of times a week. His pub- 
licity men must have been labor- 
ing extra hard. 

Nan Halloran came to see Dr. 
Cooperstock but I did not join 
them. I spent my time with him 
when there was no one else, after 
my evening rounds. Sometimes 
we played cards but more often I 
listened to him talk. The physics 
of the atomic nucleus was poetry 
when he talked of it. He told me 
about Gamow’s primordial atom 
from which all the stars and dust 



134 



GALAXY 



clouds had exploded. He ex- 
plained Fred Hoyle to me, and 
Heisenberg. But he was tiring 
early now. 

Behind the drawer of his night 
table, in a used cigarette package 
thumbtacked to the wood, his 
store of red-and-white capsules 
was growing again. They were 
still aspirin. But I think I would 
not have denied him the real 
thing if he had known the decep- 
tion and asked. We took off two 
toes in March and it was only a 
miracle that we saved the leg. 

By Gilbert Stuart. 

His late period. 

Size 9’ x 5’; heroic. 

IN THE beginning of May 
newspaper stories again began 
to appear about Donner, but I 
could not understand them. The 
stories were datelined Washing- 
ton. Donner was reported in top- 
level conferences, deeply classi- 
fied. There were no leaks, no one 
knew what the talks were about. 
But the presidential press secre- 
tary was irritable with the re- 
porters who asked questions, and 
the cabinet members were either 
visibly worried or visibly under 
orders to keep their mouths shut. 
And worried. I showed one or two 
of the stories to Dr. Cooperstock, 
but he was too tired to guess at 
implications. 

He was hanging on, but it 



would not be for long. Any night 
I expected the call from his nurses, 
and we would not be able to save 
him again. 

Then I was called to my office. 
I was lecturing to fourth-year men 
when the annunciator spoke my 
name; and when I got to my of- 
fice Governor Hewlett was there. 

“I need to see Dr. Cooper- 
stock,” he said. “I’m afraid it may 
excite him. The resident thought 
you should be present.” 

I said, “I suppose you know 
that any shock may kill him. I 
hope it’s important.” 

“It is important. Yes.” The 
Governor limped ahead of me to 
the elevator, his bald head gleam- 
ing, smiling at the nurses with his 
bad teeth and his wonderful eyes. 
Dr. Cooperstock was a hero to 
me. Governor Hewlett was some- 
thing less, perhaps a saint or a 
martyr. He was what St. George 
would have been if in the battle 
he had been killed as well as the 
dragon; Hewlett had spent himself 
against Donner in the campaign 
and now he lingered on to serve 
out his punishment for his daring, 
the weasels always chipping away 
at him, a constant witness before 
commissions and committees with 
slanders thick in the air, a subject 
for jokes and political cartoons. A 
few senators and others of his own 
party still listened to him, but 
they could not save him from the 
committees. 



THREE PORTRAITS AND A PRAYER 



135 



The Governor did not waste 
words. “Dr. Cooperstock, what 
have you done? What is Wayne 
Donner up to?” 

Cooperstock had been dozing. 
Elaborately he sat up. “I don’t 
see, sir, that it is — ” 

“Will you answer me, please? 
I’m afraid this is quite serious. 
The Secretary of Defense, who 
was with me in the House fifteen 
years ago, told me something I 
did not suspect. Do you know that 
he may be asked to resign and 
that Wayne Donner may get his 
job?” 

Dr. Cooperstock said angrily, 
“That’s nonsense. Donner’s just a 
businesman now. Anyway, what 
conceivable difference can — ” 
“It makes a difference, Dr. 
Cooperstock, because the rest of 
the cabinet is to be changed 
around at the same time. Every 
post of importance is to go to a 
man of Donner’s. You recall that 
he wanted to be President. Per- 
haps this time he does not want 
to bother with a vote. What 
weapon have you given him to 
make him so strong, Dr. Cooper- 
stock?” 

“Weapon? Weapon?” Cooper- 
stock stopped and began to gasp, 
lying back on his pillow, but he 
thrust me away when I came to 
him. “I didn’t give him any weap- 
on,” he said thoughtfully, after 
staring at the Governor’s face for 
a moment, forcing his lungs to 



work more easily. “At least, J 
don’t think I did. It was only a 
commercial matter. You see 
Governor, I have never believed 
in over-classification. Knowledge 
should be free. The basic 
theory — ” 

“Donner doesn’t intend to 
make it free, Dr. Cooperstock, he 
plans to keep it for himself. 
Please tell me what you know.” 

46TW7ELL, it’s fusion power,” 
" Cooperstock said. 

“The hydrogen bomb?” 

“Oh, for God’s sake, Governor! 
It is fusion of hydrogen, yes, but 
not in any sense a bomb. The self- 
supporting reaction takes place 
in a magnetic bottle. It will not 
explode, even if the bottle fails; 
you would have to coax it to make 
it blow up. Only heat comes out, 
with which Donner is going to 
drive steam generators, perfectly 
normal. I assure you there is no 
danger of accident.” 

“I was not thinking of an acci- 
dent,” said the Governor after a 
moment. 

“Well — In that event — I 
mean, it is true,” said Cooperstock 
with some difficulty, “that, yes, as 
the reactor is set up, it would be 
possible to remove the safeguards. 
This is only the pilot model. The 
thing could be done.” 

“By remote control, as I under- 
stand,” said Hewlett wearily. 
“And in that event each of Don- 



136 



GALAXY 



ner’s power stations would be- 
come a hydrogen bomb. Did you 
know that he has twenty-four of 
them under construction, all over 
the nation?’ 

Cooperstock said indignantly. 
“He could not possibly have 
twenty-four installations com- 
pleted in this time. I can hardly 
believe he has even one! In the 
New York plant on the river we 
designed only the fusion chamber 
itself. The hardware involved in 
generating power will take 
months.” 

“But I don’t think he bothered 
with the hardware for generating 
power, you see,” said the Gov- 
ernor. 

Dr. Cooperstock began to gasp 
again. The Governor sat watching 
him for a moment, his face sag- 
ging with a painful fatigue, and 
then he roused himself and said 
at last, “Well, you shouldn’t have 
done this, Dr. Cooperstock, but 
God bless you, you’re a great man. 
We all owe you a debt. Only we’ll 
have to do something about this 
now.” 

In my office the Governor took 
me aside. “I am sorry to have dis- 
turbed your patient. But it was 
important, as you see.” 

“Donner is a terrible man.” 

“Yes, I think that describes 
him. Well. It’s all up to us now,” 
said the Governor, looking very 
gray. “I confess I don’t know what 
we can do.” 



“Surely the government can 
handle — ” 

“Doctor,” he said, “I apologize 
for troubling you with my reflec- 
tions, I’ve not much chance to 
talk them out with anyone, but I 
assure you I have thought of 
everything the government can 
do. Donner has eight oil senators 
in his pocket, you know. They 
would be delighted to filibuster 
any legislation. For more direct 
action, I’m afraid we can’t get 
what we need without a greater 
risk than I can lightly contem- 
plate. Donner has threatened to 
blow up every city of over eight 
hundred thousand, you see. I now 
find that this threat is not empty. 
Thank you, Doctor,” he said, 
getting up. “I hope I haven’t dis- 
tressed your patient as much as 
he has distressed me.” 

He limped to the door, shook 
hands and was gone. 

Half an hour later it was time 
for my rounds. I had spent the 
time sitting, doing nothing, almost 
not even thinking. 

But I managed to go around, 
and then Dr. Cooperstock’s nurse 
signaled me. He had asked her to 
phone Nan Halloran for him, and 
should she do it? There was a 
message: “I have something else 
for Wayne.” 

¥ FOUND that puzzling but, as 
you will understand, I was in 
an emotionally numb state; it was 



THREE PORTRAITS AND APRAYER 



137 






difficult to guess at what it meant. 
I told the nurse she could trans- 
mit the message. But when Nan 
Halloran arrived, an hour or two 
later, I waited in the hall outside 
Dr. Cooperstock’s room until she 
came out. 

“Why, Doctor,” she said, look- 
ing very lovely. 

I took her by the arm. It was 
the first time I had touched that 
flesh, we had not even shaken 
hands before; I took her to my 
office. She seemed eager to go 
along with me. She asked no 
questions. 

In the office, the door closed, I 
was extremely conscious of being 
alone in a room with her. She 
knew that, of course. She took a 
cigarette out of her purse, sat 
down and crossed her legs. Gal- 
lant, I stumbled to my desk and 
found a match to light her ciga- 
rette. 

“You’ve been worrying Coopie,” 
she said reproachfully. “You and 
that Hewlett. Can’t he stay out of 
a simple business matter?” 

She surprised me; it was such 
a foolish thing to say and she was 
not foolish. I told her very briefly 
what Hewlett had said. No one 
had told me to be silent. She 
touched my hand, laughing. 
“Would it make so very much 
difference . Martin? (May I?) 
Donner’s not a monster.” 

“I don’t know that.” 

She said impishly, “I do. He’s 



a man like other men, Martin 
And really he’s not so young, even 
with all the treatments. What 
would you give him, with all his 
treatments? Twenty more years 
tops?” 

“A dictatorship even for twenty 
minutes is an evil thing, Miss 
Halloran,” I said, wondering if j 
had always sounded so complete- 
ly pompous. 

“Oh, but bad words don’t make 
bad things. Sakes! Think what 
they could call me, dear! Donner’s 
only throwing his weight around, 
and doesn’t everyone? As much 
weight as he has?” 

“Treason — ” I began, but she 
hardly let me get even the one 
word out. 

“No bad words, Martin. You’d 
be astonished if you knew what 
wonderful things Wayne wants to 
do. It takes a man like him to 
take care of some problems. He’ll 
get rid of slums, juvenile delin- 
quents, gangsters . .” 

“Some problems are better not 
solved. Hitler solved the Jewish 
question in Europe.” 

She said sweetly, “I respect 
you, Martin. So does Wayne. You 
have no idea how much he and 
Dr. Cooperstock think of you, and 
so do I, so please don’t do any- 
thing impulsive.” 

She walked out the room and 
left it very empty. 

I felt turgid, drained and a little 
bit stupid. I had never wanted 



138

. 

anything as much as I had wanted 
her. 

It was several minutes before 
I began to wonder why she had 
taken the trouble to entice me in 
a pointless conversation. I knew 
that Nan Halloran was her own 
bank account, spent as thriftily 
as Donner’s billions. I wondered 
what it was that I had had that 
she was willing to. purchase with 
the small change of a few words 
and a glimpse of her knees and 
the scent of her perfume. 

Before I had quite come to 
puzzle the question through, 
while I was still regretting I had 
had no higher-priced commodity 
for her, my phone rang. It was 
Dr. Cooperstock’s nurse, hysteri- 
cal. 

Nan Halloran’s conversation 
had not been pointless. While we 
were talking two ambulance at- 
tendants had come to assist Dr. 
Cooperstock into a wheelchair, 
and he was gone. 

To Whom 

all things concern 

r\N THE fourth of May Dr. 

Cooperstock defected and in 
the morning of the fifth Governor 
Hewlett telephoned me. “He’s not 
back?” he said, and I said he 
wasn’t, and Hewlett, pausing only 
a second, said, “Well. We can’t 
wait any longer. The Army is 
moving in.” 



I went from my office to the 
operating room and I was shaking 
as I scrubbed in. 

It was a splenectomy, but the 
woman was grossly fat, with a 
mild myocarditis that required 
external circulation. It took all of 
my attention, for which I was 
grateful. We were five hours in 
the room, but it was successful 
and it was not until I was smoking 
a cigarette in the little O.R. 
lounge that I began to shake. 

Twenty-four nuclear bombs in 
twenty-four cities. And of course 
one of them, the one that we knew 
was ready to go off, was in the 
city I was in. I remembered the 
power plant, off in the Hudson 
River under the bridge, yellow 
brick and green glass. It was not 
more than a mile away. 

And yet I was alive. The city 
was not destroyed. There had 
been no awful blast of heat and 
concussion. 

I walked into the recovery 
room to look at the splenectomy. 
She was all right, but the nurse 
stared at me, so I went back to 
my office, realizing that I was 
crying. 

And Nan Halloran was there 
waiting for me, looking like a 
drunken doll. 

She pulled herself together as 
I came in. Her lipstick was 
smeared, and she shook. “You 
win, Martin,” she said, with a 
little laugh. “Who would have 



THREE PORTRAITS AND APRAYER

thought old Coopie was such a 
lion? He gave me something for 
you.” 

I poured her a drink. “What 
happened?” 

“Oh,” said she. She drank the 
whiskey, politely enough, but 
showing she needed it. “Coopie 
came to Wayne and made a deal. 
Politics, he said, is out of my line, 
but you owe me something, I’ve 
helped you, I’ll help you more, 
only you must promise that re- 
search will be free and well en- 
dowed. He had it very carefully 
worked out, the man is a genius.” 
She giggled and held out her 
glass. “Funny. Of course he’s a 
genius. So Wayne took the hook 
and said it was a deal, what was 
Coopie going to do for him next? 
And Coopie offered to show him 
how to convert the power plant to 
a different kind of bomb. Neu- 
trons, he said.” So Dr. Cooper- 
stock had taken the billionaire 
down into the guarded room and, 
explaining how it was possible to 
change the type of nuclear re- 
action from a simple hot explo- 
sion to a cold, killing flood of rays 
that would leave the city un- 
harmed, if dead, he had diverted 
the hydrogen fuel supply, starved 
the reaction and shut off the mag- 
netic field that contained it. 

And then he had told Donner 
all deals were off. 

There was nothing hard about 
rebuilding the field and restarting 



the reaction, of course. It only 
took a few days; but Donner no 
longer had days. “I told Wayne,” 
said Nan Halloran gravely, drain- 
ing her glass, “I told him he 
should wait until he had all the 
bombs ready, but he’s — he was 
— he’s still, but I think not for 
long, hard-headed. I have to go 
now, my plump friend, and I do 
thank you for the drink. I believe 
they’re going to arrest me.” She 
got up and picked up her white 
gloves, and at the door she paused 
and said, “Did I tell you? I’ve got 
so many things on my mind. 
Coopie’s dead. He wouldn’t let 
Wayne’s doctors touch him.” 

r I ''HEY did arrest her, of course. 
A But by and by, everything 
calming down, they let her go 
again. She’s even starring in the 
movies again, you can see her 
whenever you like. I’ve never 
gone. 

The letter in the envelope was 
from Dr. Cooperstock and it said: 

I’ve pulled their fuses, Martin, 
for you and the Governor, and if 
it kills me, as you should know it 
must, please don’t think that I 
mind dying. Or that I am afraid 
to live, either. This is not suicide. 
Though I confess that I cannot 
choose between the fear of living 
in this world and the fear of what 
may lie beyond it. 

The leg is very bad. You would 



140 



GALAXY 



not even let me wear elastic socks, 
and for the past hour I have been 
crawling around the inside of 
Donner’s stainless-steel plumbing. 
It was really a job for a younger 
man, but I couldn’t find one in 
time. 

So I suppose these are my last 
words, and I wish I could make 
them meaningful. I expect there 
is a meaning to this. Science, as 
one of my predecessors once 
said — Teller, was it? — has be- 
come simpler and more beautiful. 
And surely it has become more 
wonderful and strange. If gravity 
itself grows old and thin, so that 
the straggling galaxies themselves 
weaken as they clutch each other, 
it seems somehow a much lesser 
thing that we too should grow 
feeble. Yet I do hate it. I am able 
to bear it at all, indeed, only 
through a Hope which I never 
dared confess even to you, Martin, 
before this. 

When I was young I went to 
church and dreaded dying for the 
fear of hellfire. When I was older 
I dreaded nothing; and when I 
was older still I began to dread 
again. The hours, my friends, in 
which I held imaginary conversa- 
tions with the God I denied — 
proving to Him, Martin, that He 
did not exist — were endless. And 
then, past Jehovah and prophets, 
I found another God, harsher, 
more awful and more remote. I 
could not pray to Him, Creator 
of the Big Bang, He Who Came 
Before the Monobloc. But I could 
fear Him. 

Now I am not afraid of Him. 



A galaxy twenty billion years old 
has given me courage. If there was 
no monobloc there can have been 
no God Who made it. I live in the 
hope of the glorious steady state! 

It was weak and wicked of me 
to give Donner a gun to point at 
the world, therefore, and I expect 
it is fair if I die taking it back; but 
it is not to save the world that I do 
it but to save my own soul in the 
galaxies yet to be born. For if the 
steady state is true there is no end 
to time. And infinity is not 
bounded, in any way. Everything 
must happen in infinity. Every- 
thing must happen ... an infinity 
of times. 

So Martin, in those times to 
come, when these atoms that com- 
pose us come together again, un- 
der what cis-Andromedan star I 
cannot imagine, we will meet — 
if there is infinity it is sure — and 
I can hope. In that day may we 
be put together more cleanly, 
Martin. And may we meet again, 
all of us, in shapes of pleasing 
strength and health, members of 
a race that is, I pray, a little wiser 
and more kind. 

That was the letter from Dr. 
Rhine Cooperstock. I folded it 
away. I called my secretary on 
the intercom to tell her that his 
suite would now be free for an- 
other patient; and I went out into 
the spring day, to the great black 
headlines with Donner’s name 
over all the papers and to the life 
that Cooperstock had given back 
to US all. — KREDERIK POHL, 



THREE PORTRAITS AND A PRAYER

You too can be a Qurono. All you need do is geoplanct. All you 
need know is when to stop! 

By JIM HARMON Illustrated by RITTER 



B ARNHART sauntered 
right into the middle 
of them. He covertly 
watched the crew close in around 
him and he never twitched an 
eyelash. Officers must never pan- 
ic, he reminded himself, and man- 
ipulated the morning sighting on 
the nearest sun through the Fitz- 
gerald lens. It was exactly 
900:25:30, Galactic Time. 

He jotted the reading in, satis- 
fied. The warm breath tickling 
the back of his neck was unnerv- 



ing. If he showed fear and grab- 
bed a blaster from the locker he 
could probably control them, 
but he was devastingly aware that 
a captain must never show fear. 

“Captain Barnhart,” Simmons, 
the mate, drawled politely, “do 
you still plan on making the jump 
at 900 thirty?” 

The captain removed his eye- 
glasses and polished the lenses. 

“Simmons,” he said in comfort- 
ing, confiding tones, “you are well 
aware that regulations clearly 



142 



GALAXY 



state that a spaceship that phases 
in on a star in major trans-spot 
activity is required to re-phase 
within twenty-four hours to avoid 
being caught in turbulence.” 

“Yes, sir,” Simmons said. “But, 
as I have stated before, it is my 
belief that regulation means that 
a ship should phase to avoid the 
possibility of being caught in an 
energy storm. We landed right in 
the middle of one. As you are 
aware, sir, if we phase now there 
is an excellent chance we will 
warp right into the sun!” 

Barnhart shook his lean, bronze 
head wearily. “Simmons, the Ad- 
miralty has gone through this 
thousands of times. Obviously 
they know our danger is greater 
by staying where we are. Why, 
Ignatz 6Y out there may nova! 
We’ll have to take our chances.” 

“No, sir.” Simmons thrust his 
pale, blue-veined jaw at him, his 
light eyes Nordicly cold below a 
blond cropping. “The storm spots 
are dying down. We aren’t phas- 
ing yet.” 

Barnhart drew himself up and 
looked down at the mate. Behind 
Simmons, York moved closer. 
The captain was suddenly aware 
of York’s low forehead and mus- 
cular, free-swinging arms. It was 
probably sheer bias, but he had 
frequently entertained the idea 
that Englishmen were closer to 
our apelike ancestor than most 
people . the way they ran 



around painted blue when every- 
body was civilly wearing clothes 
and all. Obviously York was in- 
capable of thinking for himself 
and was willing to do anything 
Simmons commanded him to do. 

It became transparent to Barn- 
hart that they were going to mu- 
tiny to avoid following their duty 
as clearly outlined in regulations. 
Judging from York’s twitching 
knuckles, they were going to re- 
sist by strangling him. 

Barnhart wondered if this was 
the time to show fear and unlock 
a weapon to defend himself. 

York clamped onto him before 
he could decide on the proper 
interpretation of the regulations 
and just as his mind settled on 
the irresolvable question: If a 
captain must never show fear, 
why was he given the key to a 
hand weapons locker to use when 
in fear of his life? 

¥> ARNHART gazed around the 
purple clearing with clouded 
eyes. He trembled in near trau- 
matic shook. It was almost too 
much to bear. 

Regulations clearly stated that 
no officer was to be marooned on 
a .9 Earth-type planet at fourteen- 
forty Galactic Time, early even- 
ing local. 

Or (he brushed at his fore- 
head) he was damned certain 
they at least strongly implied it. 

But fear was such a foreign ele- 



ALWAYS A QURONO 



143 



ment to his daily routine he dis- 
carded it. 

The scene took him back to 
his boyhood. 

He sorted out the survival 
supplies, lifting even the portable 
nuclear generator effortlessly un- 
der the .67 gravity, and remem- 
bered how he used to go camping 
regularly every month when he 
was a Boy Scout. He had been a 
bookish child, too obsessed with 
reading, they told him. So he had 
put himself on a regular schedule 
for play. Still, it never seemed to 
make people like him much 
better. After he established his 
routine he didn’t try to change 
it — he probably couldn’t make 
things better and he certainly 
couldn’t stand them any worse. 

Barnhart paused in his labors 
and stripped off his soaked uni- 
form shirt, deciding to break out 
his fatigues. As the wet sleeve 
turned wrong side out he noticed 
his wristwatch showed fifteen 
hundred hours. 

As usual he fetched his tooth- 
brush from the personals kit and 
started to scrub his teeth. 

This was when he saw his first 
qurono in the act of geoplancting. 

It a deeply disturbing exper- 
ience. 

DARNHART and the lank, 
slick-bodied alien ignored 
each other every morning while 
the marooned captain had his 



coffee and the native chronoped; 
each afternoon while Barnhart 
laid down for a nap and the other 
xenogutted; and of course before 
retiring while Barnhart brushed 
his teeth and the alien did his 
regular stint of geoplancting. 

The captain sat about arrang- 
ing living quarters on the planet. 
The crew of the Quincey had pro- 
vided him with every necessity 
except communications gear. Still 
he was confident he would find 
a way back and see that Simmons 
and the rest got the punishment 
clearly called for in Regulation 
C-79, Clause II. 

This driving need to have the 
regulation obeyed was as close as 
he could get to anger. 

His lot was a rough and primi- 
tive one, but he sat down to doing 
the best with things that he could. 
Using the nuclear reactor, he 
synthesized a crude seven-room 
cottage. He employed an unortho- 
dox three-story architecture. This 
gave him a kind of observation 
tower from which he could watch 
to see if the natives started to get 
restless. Traditionally, this would 
be a bad sign. 

Humming to himself, he was 
idly adding some rococo work 
around the front door when thir- 
teen-hundred-thirty came up and 
he stopped for his nap. At the 
edge of the now somewhat larger 
clearing the alien was xenogutting 
in the indigo shadows of a droop- 



144 



GALAXY 



ing bush-tree. Since he hadn’t 
furnished the house yet, Barnhart 
stretched out on the grass. Sud- 
denly he sat upright and shot a 
glance at the alien. Could this sort 
of thing be regarded as restless 
activity? 

He was safe so long as the 
aliens maintained their regular 
routine but if they started to de- 
viate from it he was in trouble. 

He tossed around on the velvet 
blades for some minutes. 

He got to his feet. 

The nap would have to be by- 
passed. As much as he resented 
the intrusion on his regular rou- 
tine he would have to find some 
other natives. He had to know if 
all the aliens on the planet 
xenogutted each afternoon as he 
was having his nap. 

The though crossed his mind 
that he might not wake up some 
afternoon if his presence was 
causing the aliens to deviate 
dangerously from their norm. 

r T , HE most unnerving thing 
about the village was that 
there were exactly ten houses and 
precisely one hundred inhabit- 
ants. Each house was 33.3+ feet 
on a side. The surfaces were hand- 
hewn planking or flat-sided logs. 
There were four openings: each 
opposing two were alternately 
one foot and an alarming ten feet 
high. Barnhart couldn’t see the 
roof. The buildings appeared 



square, so he supposed the houses 
were 33.3+ feet tall. 

At the end of the single packed, 
violet-earthed street facing up 
the road was a large sign of some 
unidentifiable metal bearing the 
legend in standard Galactic: 

THIS IS A VILLAGE OF 
QURONOS 

Barnhart received the informa- 
tion unenthusiastically. He had 
never before encountered the 
term. The sign might as well have 
told him the place was a town of 
jabberwockies. 

The single scarlet sun with its 
corona of spectrum frost was 
drawing low on the forest-covered 
horizon. Barnhart, dry of mouth 
and sore of foot, had not encoun- 
tered yet a single one of the hun- 
dred inhabitants. He had missed 
his nap and his dinner, and now 
(he ran his tongue over his thick- 
feeling teeth) he was about to 
miss his nightly brushing of his 
teeth. He had taken only a mini- 
mum survival kit with him — 
which did not include a smaller 
personals kit. 

His wristwatch, still on good, 
reliable ship’s time, recorded 
nearly fifteen hundred hours 
straight up. His body chemistry 
was still operating on the Cap- 
tain’s Shift, whereby he spent part 
of the time with both the day and 
night shifts. It was nearly time 



ALWAYS A QURONO 



145 



for him to go to bed. Fortunately 
it was almost night on the planet. 

He was searching out his port- 
able force field projector from 
some loose coins and keys when 
the one hundred quronos came 
out of their houses and began 
geoplancting. 

Fifth Day Marooned 
The Journal of 

Captain T. P. Barnhart, Late of 
the U.C.S. Quincey 

It becomes apparent that 1 
may never leave alive this planet 
whose name and co-ordinates 
have been kept from me. By rea- 
son, justice and regulations, the 
men who put me here must pay 
(see formal attached warrant 
against First Mate O. D. Sim- 
mons and the remainder of my 
crew). For this reason and in 
the interest of science I am be- 
ginning this journal, to which 1 
hope to continue contributing 
from time to time, barring sud- 
den death. 

At this writing 1 am in a vil- 
lage of ten houses identified as 
a settlement of quronos. These 
tall, hairless humanoids have 
performed an intricate series of 
indescribable actions since I 
first encountered them. My 
problem, as is apparent, is to 
decide whether these actions 
constitute their normal daily 
routine or whether 1 have insti- 
gated this series of actions. 

If the latter is the case: where 
will it all end? 

1700: Fifth day 



Barnhart was not used to being 
ignored. 

It was certainly not a part of 
his normal routine. Often in his 
life he had been scorned and 
ridiculed. Later, when he earned 
a captaincy in the exploration 
service, the men around him had 
to at least make a show of respect 
and paying attention to him. Be- 
ing ignored was a new experience 
for him. While it was a strange 
thing to say of an explorer, Barn- 
hart didn’t particularly like new 
experiences ... or rather he only 
liked the same kind of new ex- 
periences. 

He kicked the wine-colored soil 
in red-faced impotence the first 
few dozen times quronos went 
silently past him on the way to 
gather fruit from the forest, or 
hew logs to keep the buildings in 
repairs (which seemed to be a 
constant occupation.) 

However, when the twenty-fifth 
alien shouldered past him the 
morning after he first discovered 
the village, Barnhart caught him 
by the shoulder, swung him half 
around and slugged him off his 
feet with a stabbing right cross. 

The alien shook his head fog- 
gily a few times and slowly 
climbed to his feet. 

Barnhart bit at his under lip. 
That hadn’t been a wise thing to 
do at all. He should know that 
unorthodox moves like that led 
only to certain disaster. He fum- 



146 



GALAXY 



bled for his force-field projector, 
and with a flush of adrenalin dis- 
covered he had lost it. 

Now, he thought, the alien will 
signal the rest of them. And they, 
all one hundred of them (now 
does that include the one I first 
saw in the clearing or not?) they 
will converge on me and — 
The qurono marched off into 
the forest. 

Everyone was still ignoring 
Barnhart. 

TJARNHART munched on a 
steak sandwich listlessly and 
watched the aliens through the 
faint haze of the force field. 

He had found the projector 
half stamped into the earth and 
he was testing it. But even a test 
was foolish. None of them was 
close enough to him to harm him 
with so much as a communicable 
disease. He might as well quit 
roughing it and get back to the 
cottage. 

In the last few days he had had 
time to think. He took up his 
journal. 

Eighth Day 
I can only suppose that these 
actions of the aliens represent 
some kind of religious ritual. 
Again I am presented with the 
problem of whether these rituals 
are a part of their normal, daily 
life, or are they a special series 
instigated by my presence? 
Yesterday I observed two of 



the quronos repairing one of the 
village houses. The native lum- 
ber seems to be ill-suited to con- 
struction purposes. Several 
times I have noticed logs tear- 
ing themselves free and crawling 
back into the virgin forest. Due 
to the instability of their build- 
ing materials the aliens are con- 
stantly having to repair their 
houses. 

In watching the two quronos 
at work I observed something 
highly significant. 

The humanoids worked 
smoothly as a team, splitting 
and planing down the reluctant 
logs with double-bladed axes. 
Then, putting the lumber in 
place, they fastened it down 
with triangular wooden pegs. 
They pounded these pegs home 
awkwardly with the flat side of 
the axes. 

The axes are crude and ob- 
viously indigenous to the cul- 
ture. 

I view this with considerable 
alarm. 

Obviously any culture that 
can produce an axe is capable of 
inventing the hammer. 

The quronos are not using 
their hammers in front of me. 

I am producing a change in 
their routine. 

Where will it end? 

What are they saving their 
hammers for? 

800: Eighth Day 

Barnhart had written that just 
before dawn, but as usual the 
aliens had continued to ignore 



148 



GALAXY 



' I 

him. For all he knew the ritual 
might go on for years — before 
they used their hammers. Or 
whatever they were planning. 

It was drawing near time for 
his nap, but he felt completely 
wide awake even inside the safety 
of the force field. His throat hurt 
and the backs of his legs ached 
with the waiting, the waiting for 
the natives to come out and begin 
xenogutting. 

He wiped his hands together 
and forced a smile. Why should 
he worry what the natives did? 
He was completely safe. He 
could live out his life in im- 
mutable security. 

But this wasn’t his world. No 
part of it was his . or at least 
only the part he had brought with 
him. Sanity lay in holding to what 
was left of his own world. But san- 
ity didn’t always mean survival. 

What if he could make the 
quronos’ world his own? 

Barnhart wiped at the tiny 
stings against his face and his 
fingertips came away moist with 
beads of perspiration. 

The aliens began marching out 
of the houses, in twos from the 
ten-foot doors, singly from the 
foot-square openings of every 
other facing wall. 

It wasn’t his world of fire- 
works-streaked Ohio summers 
and bold green hills, this planet 
cowled with nun-like secrecy, 
looking acrid, tasting violet and 



transmitting a beauty and con- 
fusion only a trio of physical sci- 
entists could solve. 

But there was only one thing 
to do. 

Barnhart let down his force 
field and went out. 

The human body wasn’t well- 
adapted for it but Barnhart did 
his best to join the quronos in 
xenogutting. 

Instantly the cry welled up. 
“Master.” 

Barnhart stood up and faced 
the aliens, deeply disturbed. 

TTE was even more disturbed 
when, later, he wrote again 
in his journal: 

Ninth day 
“Qurono,” I have learned 
from the Leader, is a term refer- 
ring to a particular type of sub- 
human android. The synthetic 
process used in manufacturing 
these men does not allow them 
to develop beyond a certain 
point — a built-in safety factor 
of their creators, I can only sup- 
pose. Thus they were given the 
concept of the axe and have re- , 

tained it, but they were able 
only to devise the idea of using 
the axe to hammer things with 
and are not capable of thinking 
of a special hammering tool. 

With almost complete lack of 
creative ability they are bound 
to the same routine, to which 
they adhere with an almost re- 
ligious fanaticism. 



ALWAYS A QURONO 



149 



Since last night I have been 
treated as virtually a god. I have 
been given one of their build- 
ings entirely for my own use. 

1 find this turn of events ob- 
solutely surprising. 1 intend to 
discuss this with the Leader to- 
day. (Note to any ethnologist 
who may see these papers: Since 
all quronos are built to the 
same standards none is superior 
to another. But, recognizing the 
need for one director, each of 
the one hundred has an alter- 
nate term as Leader.) 

900: Ninth day 

Despite the upsetting turn of 
events Barnhart decided he was 
more comfortable in his familiar 
role of command. 

He glanced at his wristwatch 
and was surprised to note that he 
had overslept. The time for both 
breakfast and chronopting was 
past. He made himself ready and 
left the building. 

The alien was waiting just out- 
side the door. He looked as if he 
hadn’t moved all night. Yet, 
Barnhart thought, he seemed a 
trifle shorter. 

“Are you the Leader?” Barn- 
hart asked. 

“I am the Leader. But you are 
the Master.” 

As an officer of a close-confines 
spaceship that sounded a little 
stuffy even to Barnhart. The fel- 
low still looked shorter. Maybe 
they had changed Leaders the 
way he had been told the night 



before. Or maybe quronos shrank 
when left out in the night air. 

“Let’s go someplace where we 
can sit down. And, incidentally, 
just call me ‘sir’ or ‘captain.’ ” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Barnhart nodded. He had been 
expecting: Yes, Master, I will call 
you ‘captain.’ 

But the alien didn’t move. He 
finally decided that the Leader 
thought they could sit on the 
ground where they were standing. 

Barnhart squatted. 

The Leader squatted. 

Before they could speak a muf- 
fled explosion vibrated the ground 
and Barnhart caught a fleeting 
glimpse of an unstable chemical 
rocket tearing jerkily into the 
maroon sky. 

“Celebration for my arrival?” 
Barnhart asked. 

“Perhaps so. We are putting the 
un-needed ones in status.” 

He decided to let that ride for 
the moment. 

“Tell me, why didn’t you rec- 
ognize me before I joined you in 
your — ritual, Leader?” 

The alien tilted his head. 
“What was there to recognize? 
We thought you were some new 
variety of animal. Before you 
xenogutted how were we to know 
you were rational life?” 

Barnhart nodded. “But how did 
you so cleverly deduce that I was 
your Master?” 

“There are one hundred of us. 



150 



GALAXY 



You were the one hundred and 
first. You had to be the Master 
returned.” 

The Master had been some 
friendly lifeform in the Federa- 
tion, obviously. Otherwise the 
qurono androids wouldn’t speak 
Galactic. Barnhart nibbled on his 
under lip. 

“I want to find out how much 
you still know after the Master 
has been away so long,” the cap- 
tain said. “Tell me, how do you 
communicate with the Master?” 

“What for?” The Leader began 
to look at Barnhart oddly. 

“For anything. Where’s the sub- 
space radio?” 

The direct approach produced 
a rather ironic expression on the 
qurono’s narrow face but no 
answer. But if there was a radio 
on the planet Barnhart meant to 
find it. Spacemen forced to aban- 
don their craft were required to 
report to the nearest Federation 
base as quickly as possible. Be- 
sides, he meant to see that Sim- 
mons and his Anglo stooge and all 
the others paid for their mutiny. 
But, he decided, perhaps he had 
better not press the matter at the 
moment. 

Another rocket punctuated the 
moment of silence. 

“Take me to your launching 
area,” Barnhart said. 

The android stood up and 
walked. But he walked at Barn- 
hart’s side, forcing the captain to 



catch his stride a half-step to let 
the alien lead him. He wasn’t sure 
if it was a mark of respect not to 
get ahead of the Master or an at- 
tempt to see if he knew where the 
launching site was located. The 
quronos were limited, but just 
how limited Barnhart was begin- 
ning to wonder. 

r I , 'HEY rounded the clump 
of drooping lavender trees 
and Barnhart saw the eight men 
laying on the ground in the trans- 
parent casings. Not men, but 
quronos, he corrected himself; in 
a molded clear membrane of some 
sort. 

“They are in status,” the Leader 
explained, answering the cap- 
tain’s unasked question. 

“This is how you keep your 
population at one hundred,” 
Barnhart thought aloud, removing 
his glasses to rest his eyes and to 
get a better look at the bodies. 
Despite regulations he could still 
see better without his spectacles. 

“It is how you arranged it, 
Master. But as you know we are 
now ninety and one.” 

The captain put his glasses 
back on. “I’ll test you. Why are 
you now ninety and one?” 

“Naturally,” the Leader said 
emotionlessly, “you required a 
whole shelter unit to yourself. 
We had to dispose of the ten who 
previously had the unit.” 

Barnhart swallowed. “Couldn’t 



ALWAYS A QURONO 



151 



you think of anything less drastic? 
Next time just build a new unit.” 

“But master,” the alien pro- 

tested, “it takes a great deal of 
work to construct our units. Our 

lumber escapes so badly no 

matter how often we beat it into 
submission. Our work capacity is 
limited, as you are aware. Is it 
really desirable to overwork us 
so much?” 

The captain was a little 

shocked. Was this humorless, 
methodical android really protest- 
ing a command from his Master? 
“How do you suppose the ten you 
are putting in status feel about 
it?” he managed. 

“They would doubtlessly prefer 
not to be overworked. Our fatigue 
channels can only stand so much.” 

But it wasn’t the work, Barn- 
hart suddenly knew. It was the 
idea that there could be eleven 
houses, instead of ten. The con- 
cept of only ninety quronos and 
a master must be only slightly 
less hideous to them. They 
couldn’t really be so overjoyed to 
see him. 

A third rocket jarred off, rising 
unsteadily but surely in the low 
gravity. It was a fairly primitive 
device — evidently all they re- 
tained from the original model 
supplied them by the Master. 

Barnhart looked at the figures 
on the ground. Only seven. 

“The ones in status go into the 
rockets!” Barnhart gasped. 



“And circle in the proper or- 
bits,” the Leader agreed. 

This time he saw the quronos 
lifting a stiff form and taking it 
to the crude rocket. It looked 
entirely too much like a human 
body. Barnhart looked away. 

But at the edge of his peri- 
pheral vision he saw the quronos 
halt and stand up their fellow in 
status. He glanced at his wrist. 
Fifteen hundred hours. The aliens 
began geoplancting. 

Barnhart ran his tongue over 
his teeth, noting that they needed 
brushing. He came to himself with 
a start. 

Of course. He had almost for- 
got. 

Barnhart faced the others and 
joined them in geoplancting. 

A hideous cry built from one 
plateau of fury to another. 

“He’s no better than us!” the 
Leader screamed. 

Ninth day 
I have made a serious mis- 
take. 

While it was necessary for me 
to conform to the quronos’ rit- 
ual to get myself recognized, I 
should not have continued to 
adhere to it. Apparently by 
these creatures’ warped reason- 
ing I established myself as a 
reasoning creature by first join- 
ing them in their routine; but 
when I continued to act in ac- 
cord with them I proved myself 
no better than they are. As 



152 



GALA 



Master I am supposed to be 
superior and above their mun- 
dane routine. 

At the moment they are mill- 
ing belligerently outside my 
force-field screen. As I look into 
their stupid, imaginationless 
faces 1 can only think that 
somewhere in the past they 
were invented by some unortho- 
dox Terran scientist, probably 
of English descent. They — 

Wait. 

The force field. It’s waver- 
ing. It must have been damaged 
when it got tramped underfoot. 
They are going to get in to me. 

It — 

Barnhart watched them pre- 
pare the rocket that would blast 
him into an orbit circling the 
planet. He could see and even 
hear the sound that vibrated 
through the thin membrane in 
which he was encased, but he 
could not move a nerve-end. 
Fortunately his eyes were focused 
on infinity, so he could see every- 
thing at least blurrily. 

The Leader, who seemed to 
have grown a few inches, wasted 
no time. He gave the orders and 
the quronos lifted him into the 
rocket. The hatch closed down on 
the indigo day and he was alone. 

The blast of takeoff almost 
deafened him but he didn’t feel 
the jar — only because, he real- 
ized, he could feel nothing. 

A few weeks later the centri- 
fugal force of the spinning rocket 



finally nudged the latch and the 
hatch swung open. Barnhart was 
exposed to naked fire-bright 
blackness itself. 

After a day or two he stopped 
worrying about that, as he had 
stopped fretting about breathing. 

He grew accustomed to the 
regular turn around the planet 
every fourteen hours. For two out 
of every three seconds he faced 
out into space and that was. al- 
ways changing. Yet, all poetry 
aside, the change was always the 
same. 

He didn’t have to worry about 
keeping on a schedule. He kept on 
one automatically. 

And he didn’t like it. 

So he kept retreating further 
and further from it. 

(»(, W E couldn’t leave him 
W there!” 

What? Who? Barnhart thought 
along with at least seven other 
double-yous. He returned to him- 
self and found that he was stand- 
ing in the airlock of a spaceship, 
faced by his first mate Simmons 
and his stooge York. 

“We couldn’t leave him there,” 
Simmons repeated with feeling. 
“That would be the nastiest kind 
of murder. We might maroon him. 
But none of us are killers.” 

“It’s not the punishment we will 
get for the mutiny,” York com- 
plained. “It’s having to go back to 
his old routine. That time-sched- 



ALWAYS A QURONO 



153 



ule mind of his was derailing 
mine. He was driving the whole 
crew cockeyed. Even if he wasn’t 
going to kill us all by the rule 
book, I think we would have had 
to maroon him just to get rid of 
him.” 

Simmons fingered a thin-bladed 
tool knife. “I wonder how he got 
up there in that rocket and in this 
transparent shroud? I’m sure he’s 
alive, but this is the most unor- 
thodox Susp-An I’ve ever seen. 
Almost makes you believe in 
destiny, the way we lost our co- 
ordinate settings and had to back- 
track — and then found him out 
there. (“I’ll bet he jimmied the 
calculator,” York grouched.) 
You know, York, it’s almost as if 
the world down there marooned 
him right back at us.” 

The first mate inserted the 
knife blade. The membrane with- 
ered and Barnhart lived. 

“Now the arrest,” York mur- 
mured. 

“What are you muttering 
about, York?” Captain Barnhart 
demanded. “What are we stand- 
ing around here for? You can’t 
expect me to waste a whole after- 
noon on inspection. We have to 



get back on schedule.” He looked 
to his wrist. “Fifteen hundred 
hours.” 

“He doesn’t remember,” York 
said behind him. 

“He remembers the same old 
routine,” Simmons said. “Here we 
go again.” 

Barnhart didn’t say anything. 
In the close confines of a space- 
ship there was bound to be a cer- 
tain degree of informality. 

He stepped inside his cabin at 
the end of the corridor and did 
what he always did at fifteen hun- 
dred hours. 

York and the first mate were 
deeply disturbed. 

Barnhart looked out at them 
sharply. “Well, spacemen, I run a 
taut ship here. I expect everyone 
to hit the mark. Adhere to the 
line. Follow my example. Snap 
to it!” 

Simmons looked at York and 
his shoulders sagged. They 
couldn’t go through the whole 
thing again, the marooning, the 
rescue, then this. That routine 
would drive them crazy. 

Even this was preferable. 

They joined Barnhart in geo- 
plancting. —JIM HARMON

THE 

LUCK 

OF 

MAGNITUDES 

By GEORGE O. SMITH 

Earth's near neighbors in space are a most convenient size — for 
us. Otherwise, astronomy would be a far more difficult science! 



r T''HE human being, we are told, 
-*■ lies about halfway in the 
scale between the size of nuclear 
particles and the vastness of the 
great universe they comprise. 

This is a meaningless concept, 
because neither of these extremes 
can be appreciated. They can 
only be expressed in figures that 
require a special mathematical 
notation — because they are too 
little on one end and too large on 
the other for the kind of numbers 
we use in our daily lives. 

But it can be argued that the 
size of the Earth and its distance 
from the Sun are approximately 
ideal for the development of life. 
And once this point is estab- 
lished, it can be argued further 



that the size and distance rela- 
tionships between Earth, Moon, 
Sun and stars are just about right 
to arouse the curiosity of the first 
glimmer of intelligence, and to 
place it on the long road toward 
knowledge. 

Taking first things first, we 
start with the proposition that 
water-based hydrocarbon life is 
by far the most likely to succeed. 
Let us thus take a couple of new 
looks at Mother Earth. 

The spectral class of any sun 
will define the planetary temper- 
atures for any orbital distance we 
may want to calculate. For the 
Sun — i.e., Sol — a planet inside 
of the orbit of Venus will be too 
hot to permit the formation of ice. 






THE LUCK OF MAGNITUDES 



155 



And outside of the orbit of Mars 
it will be too cold to permit the 
formation of water vapor. Since 
water-based hydrocarbon life de- 
pends upon an environment in 
which the solid, liquid and vapor 
phases of hydrogen-oxide can 
exist in equilibrium, the solar 
radiation alone places a minimum 
and maximum limit of planetary 
distance for life to exist. The 
Earth lies just about in the center 
of Old Sol’s “life-belt.” As far as 
distance is concerned, this is in- 
deed the best of all possible 
worlds. 

Now about the size. We could 
go smaller, but not by much. Mars 
is about half the diameter of 
Earth; since mass is a function of 
the cube of the diameter, the mass 
of Mars is about one-eighth of the 
Earth. As a consequence, Mars 
hasn’t enough gravity to hang 
onto a decent atmosphere, to say 
nothing of hanging onto its water. 
For, you see, the molecular weight 
of water is only 18, whereas the 
weight of the oxygen molecule is 
32, nitrogen is 28, and carbon di- 
oxide is a whopping 44. Move 
Mars in to the orbit of the Earth, 
and the additional heat would 
boil away what little water Mars 
has managed to retain. 

^T'HE upper limit is more flexi- 
ble. If we consider an Earth 
the size of Jupiter we get into 
some interesting trouble. The first 



thing that comes to mind is the 
2 Vi gravities increase. This is 
enough to provide Jupiter with a 
dense, thick atmosphere that prob- 
ably reaches critical pressure high 
above the actual surface of the 
planet itself. “Critical pressure” 
describes a gas so highly com- 
pressed that it behaves as a liquid. 
This leads to the speculation that 
Jupiter might not have a true sur- 
face but rather a transition zone 
that passes from gas to liquid to 
solid with no defined phases. Fur- 
ther evidence is the rotation of 
the planet. The equatorial zones 
rotate at a different speed than 
the temperate zones, which rotate 
at a different speed than the polar 
zones. 

But that is only first thought. 
If we examine the picture more 
carefully, we get a shock. To sup- 
port life, Jupiter must be trans- 
planted to an orbit within the 
life-belt. But if you do this Jupiter 
will begin to evaporate. For Ju- 
piter is one of the ice-giants. That 
is, Jupiter and the huge outer 
planets are strongly suspected of 
being composed mostly of ice. 

This speculation has good 
foundation. The preponderance of 
hydrogen and oxygen in the uni- 
verse suggests that hydrogen- 
oxide is a plentiful substance in- 
deed. The density of Jupiter is 
slightly higher than that of water. 
What could be better than to 
make a tremendous planet with 



156 



GALAXY 



the density of water out of the 
most plentiful stuff in the uni- 
verse? 

Well, there’s always good old 
ammonia, NH 4 ; which, by the 
way, has the same molecular 
weight as good old H l .O. There 
are few other plentiful substances 
with the same physical character- 
istics. 

Jupiter is ten times the diame- 
ter of Earth and would therefore 
be a thousand times the mass if 
the big fellow were composed of 
rock and metal and other stuff 
as the Earth is. Instead, Jupiter 
is just a big fellow with one thou- 
sand times the volume of Earth 
— which by some odd circum- 
stance is just about the same pro- 
portion as the water-making ele- 
ments bear to the rest of the 
periodic chart found in the uni- 
verse. 

Or maybe it isn’t really so odd. 

But since a real honest-to-good- 
ness rock-and-iron Jupiter would 
have a surface gravity about 12 V 2 
times that of the Earth, let’s take 
a look at something more reason- 
able. 

Let’s add more earth to the 
Earth until we’re living on some- 
thing which is built of the same 
stuff but two times the former 
diameter. This double-Earth will 
have eight times the volume and 
mass, and the surface will be two 
times as far from the center. The 
first fact increases the gravity by 



eight. The second diminishes the 
gravity by the inverse square of 
two, which is one-fourth. This 
gives the double-Earth a surface 
gravity of 2, which provides meat 
for two pertinent observations: 

First, that the surface gravity 
of a planet is proportional to its 
diameter and to its density. (A 
fuller exposition of this statement, 
plus a table of its workings in our 
Solar System, is appended.) 

Second, the size limits for life 
aren’t as wide as we’d have ex- 
pected. Mars, at one-half the di- 
ameter of Earth, can’t hold a 
satisfactory atmosphere and even 
less water. The hypothetical dou- 
ble-Earth is too close for comfort 
to the conditions that prevail 
upon Jupiter. One is therefore 
tempted to set the size limits be- 
tween three-quarters and one and 
one-half times the diameter of 
Earth. 

TTAVING been handed this di- 
vot of celestial real estate, of 
critical size and distance from its 
primary, it remains for curiosity 
and intelligence to appreciate it. 

First, the Earth and Moon are 
unique in being more of a double 
planet that a planet and satellite 
system. From the Earth, the 
Moon subtends about a half-de- 
gree diameter circle in the sky. 
Since its orbit is fairly eccentric 
as orbits go, the apparent diame- 
ter of the Moon varies between

Surface Gravity as a Product of Diameter Times Density 



Resolved: That the surface gravity of a planet is proportional to its diameter 
and its density. 

Premise: This is a restricted way of applying Newton’s Laws in which a 
statement of the planet’s diameter defines at once the distance from surface 
to center and also the volume. By including the density, the planetary mass 
emerges automatically since mass is a function of density times volume. 
Argument 1 : Given two planets of equal density, one twice the diameter 
of the other, Planet A will have eight times the volume and hence eight 
times the mass of Planet B, and will exert eight times the attraction at a 
given distance. But the surface of Planet B is twice removed, the square 
of which is four, and thus the attraction is diminished by one-fourth; hence 
the surface gravity of Planet A is twice the surface gravity of Planet B. 
Conclusion 1: For equal densities, the surface gravity of a planet is 

directly proportional to its diameter. 

Argument 2: Given two planets of equal diameter, one twice the density 
of the other, the first will have twice the surface gravity of the second since 
their volumes are equal, the distance to the surfaces are equal and their 
masses are proportional to their densities. 

Argument 3: If Planet A, above, with twice the diameter and hence twice 
the surface gravity of Planet B, is now increased in density by two-to-one, 
its surface gravity will also be increased by two-to-one according to Argu- 
ment 2, and its surface gravity wiil then be four times the surface gravity 
of Planet B. 

Conclusion: That the surface gravity of a planet is directly proportional 

to its diameter and its density. 

The following is a table of calculations made from figures in Willy Ley’s 
Conquest of Space in which the diameters have been rounded. The surface 
gravity was calculated by the conventional method of planetary radius versus 
mass. Columns 4, 5 and 6 are my calculations, made to 10-inch sliderule 
accuracy. Agreement in surface gravity between the two methods is as 
close as the other figures are known.

slightly larger and slightly smaller 
than the Sun. This provides the 
denizens of Tellus with the gor- 
geous spectacles of total and an- 
nular eclipses of Sol. A total 
! eclipse would not be possible with 
a smaller Moon; no annular 
eclipse would occur with a larger 
one. 

Perhaps no celestial event has 
caused so much fear, awe, religion, 
fol-de-rol and scientific interest, 
and few natural events have 
awakened such an interest in re- 
cording the date and time as the 
solar eclipse. 

Thales of Miletus is supposed 
to have stopped a war between 
the Lydians and the Medes by 
predicting a solar eclipse and at- 
tributing it as a warning from un- 
pleased gods. A couple of thou- 
sand years later The Connecticut 
Yankee saved his hide by the 
same process of doing more pow- 
erful medicine than Merlin. Both 
stories are — stories. Thales could 
not have predicted time and place 
for a solar eclipse; he hadn’t 
enough knowledge. Of course, he 
undoubtedly knew the Babylon- 
ian “Secret of the Saros” in which 
the motion of the Moon and the 
pattern of lunar eclipses are re- 
peated every seventeen years. 
(Actually, every 225 lunations.) 
Thales was also aware of what 
made eclipses. He might have 
been able to predict an eclipse of 
the Moon, since this event takes 



place over several hours and is 
visible from the entire hemi- 
sphere that faces the Moon at the 
time. But, for a specific location, 
eclipses of the Sun are rare — 
although hardly a year goes by 
without at least one solar eclipse 
visible from some spot, and some 
years have two. So the closest that 
Thales could have come was to 
predict the possibility that such 
an event could take place at or 
near such and such a date. 

No moonlet such as Deimos 
would create much stir. There 
would be no great spectacle to 
fear, revere or study. Kings would 
not bother to hire Royal Astrono- 
mers to predict the unimportant 
event of a minuscule speck cross- 
ing the face of the Sun, and 
scientists would have dismissed it 
as useless until recently when the 
value of timing transits became 
known. Now, the fact that the 
king used these predictions to 
threaten his enemies or to prove 
his wisdom, or to bamboozle his 
people into thinking he had a di- 
rect contact with Jove, Wotan, 
Baal and Co., is not important. 
The side-benefit is. When the king 
appointed you to the post of 
Royal Astronomer, with a certain 
chance of being relieved of office 
by the Lord High Executioner for 
flubbing, you darned well studied 
astronomy and learned how to 
predict eclipses. 

Nor would a minute moonlet

show phases, which is a feature 
that led to early conjecture that 
the celestial bodies were spherical. 

TT WAS Anaxagoras of Clazo- 
menae who demonstrated with 
a candle and a ball that the puz- 
zling phases of the Moon could 
be explained by suggesting that 
the Moon was spherical and il- 
luminated by the moving Sun. 
This demonstration caused con- 
jecture about the rest of the ce- 
lestial bodies, mainly the five 
naked-eye planets which tend to 
wax and wane and disappear. 
Such phases or partial phases had 
to wait for Hans Lippershey to 
tell Galileo about the telescope, 
although some of the sharp-eyed 
Greeks claimed to have seen cres- 
cent phases in Venus. (This is un- 
fortunately too much like report- 
ing a vision or relating ex post 



facto a forecast of doom. One can 
claim to see the crescent phase of 
Venus with the naked eye . 
but it isn’t likely.) 

One thing is certain. The 
Greeks had some very sharp-eyed 
observers. For a concrete example 
of observing something that lies 
on the slender edge of non-visibil- 
ity, take the measurement of the 
Earth-Sun-Moon relationship per- 
formed by Aristarchus of Samos. 
Aristarchus argued that when the 
Sun and the Moon were at right 
angles, the terminator line on the 
Moon would be curved as shown 
in Figure 1, at M-l. Then when 
the Moon had moved to where 
the terminator line is straight, 
position M-2, then a right angle 
would exist between the Sun and 
the Earth with the Moon at the 
corner. For a pair of long, skinny 
triangles such as those shown, E, 



160 



GALAXY 



T 



M-l, M-2 is similar to S, M-2, E; 
that is, the triangles are the same 
shape but different in size. Once 
this layout is measured by its 
angles alone, determing any of 
the linear distances will reveal 
the whole shooting match by the 
application of some simple trig- 
onometry. 

Now comes the gimmick. The 
next time you have a chance to 
look at the Moon in either the 
first or last quarter, take a good 
look at the terminator. Watch it 
closely for about ten minutes. Ob- 
serve the change in the curvature 
of the terminator line in those ten 
minutes, for that is about what it 
takes for the Moon to move from 
M-l, geocentric quadrature, to 
M-2, lunacentric quadrature. This, 
by the way, represents a true 
movement of about five miles 
over the center of the face of the 
Moon from curved terminator to 
straight. Aristarchus flubbed, and 
so did Hipparchus, Posidonius 
and Ptolemy one after another. 
None of them believed in the vast- 
ness of the vast, so they all shaded 
their figures low. Their error 
wasn’t so great; but the important 
thing is that they did get figures 
for this split-hair experiment. 

One can, in a conjecture of this 
kind, argue that a larger Moon, 
or more comparable distances, 
might have made their work a lot 
easier. But by placing this triang- 
ulation on the very extreme limit 



of detectability, another near-im- 
possible measurement is made 
feasible. 

The same Aristarchus of Samos 
is given first credit for proposing 
the heliocentric solar system. He 
ran into two violent objections, 
neither of them religious. The first 
is the apparent absence of aber- 
ration and the second is the ap- 
parent absence of parallax. Both, 
said the other philosophers, must 
be present if the Earth is in mo- 
tion about the Sun. Let’s take 
them in order: 

Aberration is defined as a form 
of distortion in which things do 
not appear as they really are. For 
example, it is raining gently with 
no wind so that the drops are 
coming straight down. Now if you 
don your sou’wester and go for 
a drive in your chariot, you’ll ob- 
serve that the down-falling rain- 
drops are apparently coming at 
a slant, and that the amount of 
slant depends upon how fast you 
are going. Related to astronomy, 
it would appear that the source is 
forward of its true position; if we 
are in motion with respect to an 
orthogonal flow, the cloud or the 
star that emits the light must ap- 
pear to be displaced forward 
along the line of our motion. 
Thus, they argued, stars lying 
along the axis of this supposed 
orbit should describe circles, re- 
volving once each year; stars ly- 
ing along the plane of this sup- 



THE LUCK OF MAGNITUDES 



161 



posed orbit would move back and 
forth each year; and stars be- 
tween the axis and the plane 
should make ellipses with an ec- 
centricity proportional to the 
angle between these extremes. 

r T , HE lack of aberration can be 
explained in any one of 
three ways: 1) the speed of light 
is infinite; 2) the stars are so far 
away that the aberration can’t be 
detected; or 3) the Earth is ex- 
actly where we always claimed, 
immobile and at the center of the 
universe. So there! 

The truth, of course, is 2) and 
considering the Greek ability to 
measure the speed of light, we 
might well toss 1) in as a total 
loss. If it looks like a dog, smells 
like a dog, barks like a dog and 
acts like a dog — confound it, 
it is a dog. If you can’t see some- 
thing it’s invisible, and if you 
can’t measure something it might 
as well be infinite! 

It turns out that the Constant 
of Aberration is 20.47 seconds of 
arc. Divide the diameter of the 
Moon into 1800 equal parts, draw 
a circle the size of one part and 
you’ll have the displacement that 
the Greeks couldn’t observe. 

We all know about parallax. 
Thales seems to have discovered 
it in his studies in geometry; he 
used it to measure the distance 
from shore to a ship at sea. This 
was the first optical range-finder 



system and it lasted about 2500 
years, until' radar displaced it 
during the late unpleasantness. 

With parallax in mind, the pro- 
ponents of the geocentric theory 
scoffed at a mobile Earth. 

When parallax is mentioned, 
the star 61 Cygni comes to mind 
because it was the first to be 
measured. Um — the heliocentric 
parallax of 61 Cygni is listed at 
0.293 seconds of arc. This isn’t 
simply splitting hairs, friend. It’s 
dividing hairs into umpteen hun- 
dred equal slices. And that ain’t 
all. 61 Cygni has a proper motion. 
That is, it moves as all celestial 
bodies move; 61 Cygni moves 
across the sky at the rate of 5.22 
seconds of arc per year. 

So whither 61 Cygni? With a 
declination of about 40 degrees, 
its aberration will make an ap- 
parent ellipse about twice as long 
as it is wide; its dimensions will 
be the Constant of Aberration, 
20.47 seconds. This ellipse will 
flow across the sky doing 5.22 
seconds linear motion per year. 
The ellipse will be distorted by 
heliocentric parallax of 0.293 
seconds. 

The only thing that keeps helio- 
centric parallax from being com- 
pletely smothered is that we don’t 
measure it by sighting the star 
and then reading the setting cir- 
cles on the telescope. It is done 
by comparison against the back- 
ground of stars, all of which un- 



162 



GALAXY 



dergo equal aberration, cancel- 
ling it. What remains is the proper 
motion and parallax which com- 
bine to produce a wavy line 5.22 
seconds between peaks and 0.293 
seconds amplitude. 

In passing, the nearest star, 
Alpha Centauri, has a parallax of 
only 0.760 seconds and a proper 
motion of 3.68 seconds. Neither 
of these make a whale of a lot of 
improvement over 61 Cygni. 

"VTOU may argue in favor of a 
larger orbit, which would pro- 
vide a longer heliocentric base- 
line. It would be colder, but if 
we’d evolved on an Earth-sized 
planet along the orbit of Mars 
we’d have had enough air to 
breathe and we’d have become 
accustomed to the chilly temper- 
ature. 

The distance from the Earth to 
the Sun is still a subject for argu- 
ment. The best estimates place 
the error at plus or minus about 
50,000 miles. Move Earth out 
farther and solar parallax dimin- 
ishes accordingly. Solar parallax 
is so nearly a straight line that it 
becomes difficult to assay, using 



the diameter of the Earth as a 
baseline. For the Sun can’t be 
compared in position against the 
starry background like measur- 
ing the parallax of a star. During 
total eclipse? Fine, but could you 
trust your figures, realizing that 
the gravitational field of Old Sol 
will diffract light rays just as A. 
Einstein said it would? 

Make the Earth bigger? That 
means a more dense atmosphere 
and greater diffraction. Since geo- 
centric parallax requires measure- 
ments made from the widest sep- 
aration, the geometry places the 
observed object low near the 
horizon whether it is sighted si- 
multaneously by two stations a 
hemisphere apart or by one sta- 
tion with a twelve-hour wait be- 
tween sightings. Refraction gets 
worse as the object approaches 
the horizon. What is gained by 
distance is lost by distortion. 
Make the Earth larger by the ac- 
ceptable physical limit and — 
again, what is gained by distance 
is lost by distortion. 

City hall isn’t the only thing 
that can’t be licked.

T HERE are mornings and 
mornings. This was one of 
the latter. Rotten clear 
( through. 

Isaac Nels Rhinelander knew 
very well the cause of the dark 
brown taste in his mouth the mo- 
ment he awoke. In characteristic 
fashion he charged his happiness 



deficit to other accounts. For ex- 
ample, the violent argument at 
breakfast with his brother-in-law, 
Atwater Pope. 

Ten minutes after it was over, 
Rhinelander couldn’t even re- 
member the topic. How cumulus 
clouds formed. The dimension of 
a gnat’s wing. Some other equally

inane subject from the filler slugs 
of the morning news sheet that 
unreeled from the printer in the 
breakfast atrium of Rhinelander’s 
(actually his wife Iris’s — ugh) 
villa. 

Watty sat there, cool and edu- 
cated and superior, adjusting the 
chinstrap of his bumishfed steel 



crash helmet (He was flying his 
vertiracer in a rally at noon.) To 
every argument Rhineland put 
forth, Watty replied in metaphor 
and epigram and little rapier 
thrusts of logic. Finally Rhine- 
lander just screamed. Lost the 
argument, of course. Watty 
chuckled, activated his sports-

model personnel jets and went 
flying out of the atrium the win- 
ner. As always. 

That was enough to make 
Rhinelander feel rotten through 
and through. But it wasn’t the 
true cause of the rotten feeling. 
Rhinelander found still other 
events to blame. Such as: 

The unaccountable breakdown 
of his Chrome De Luxe Executive 
Limoubus, whose magnetic pilot 
jumped the aerialway guidestrip 
on the two hundred and sixty mile 
trip from the suburbs into New 
York, and crashed in an undigni- 
fied although harmless way into 
the thick foamex median. Other 
conveyances whizzed by. Their 
occupants cheerfully smoked or 
read morning tickers, unable to 
stop. Rhinelander had to trudge 
in the hot sun to a call box. He 
had to suffer the sneers of the 
mechanics who came, raised the 
forward deck of the Limoubus by 
means of magnetic cranes and 
then took care of his difficulty. 

Actually, it required only one 
mechanic to solve the trouble. He 
just reconnected a short spring 
which held two motor rods to- 
gether in a most untechnical way. 
Rhinelander stumped from one 
foot to the other, beet red. He saw 
that the mechanics were exchang- 
ing sidelong glances of derision at 
his expense while they totaled up 
their bill. They let him go easily, 
however: eighty-five dollars. But 



that didn’t relieve the mounting 
rottenness of the day. 

As the Limoubus whisked on 
toward the slender gleaming py- 
lons of the megalopolis eighty 
miles ahead, Rhinelander once 
more felt the sting of the true 
cause of his anger and frustration. 
Hot stabs of jealousy, of virulent 
envy, shot through him. He re- 
fused to acknowledge them, wait- 
ing, just waiting, for the next 
mess. 

That mess was not long in com- 
ing. 

TT happened ten seconds after 

he walked through the elec- 
tronic doors of The Rhinelander 
Galleries, which occupied the en- 
tire first floor of The General 
Matter Building on Park Mall. 

In the lift-tube up from the gar- 
age, Rhinelander had halfway 
composed himself. After all, he 
was about to enter his own per- 
sonal domain, as he did on the 
three working days of each week. 
He pulled his corpulent frame up 
to its full height of five feet three. 
His cheeks stopped flapping. His 
protuberant blue eyes receded in- 
to their sockets. Like an emperor 
he breezed through the doors, 
rubbing his plump little hands. 

And stopped. 

Under the multicolored beams 
which bathed the central display 
pedestal in the gallery’s marble 
foyer, several of his employees, 



166 



GALAXY 



including his assistant Phenley, 
were wringing their hands and 
gazing at a litter of striated cop- 
per-shot stone on the floor. Phen- 
ley rushed forward. 

“The workmen,” he gargled. 
“Teamsters. Hook slippage during 
erection.” 

Gazing at the wreckage of Jan 
van der Maarsch’s rendering of 
The Culture of the Womb, Rhine- 
lander shrieked, “Get out of my 
sight, Phenley, before I kill you! 
Two hundred thousand I pay for 
that, and you let the boobs break 
it before we even get the critics 
in! Call the insurance people and 
stay away for two weeks or I 
won’t answer for your safety!” 

“Oh, sir, I’m so terribly sorry, 
so terribly sorry,” Phenley kept 
saying. Then Phenley’s voice was 
silenced by another sound. One 
of the gallery functionaries poked 
at a last piece of the sculpture 
teetering on the pedestal. 

This piece, of course, crashed 
to the floor just a second before 
Rhinelander stepped into his pri- 
vate office. 

By now his cheeks were flap- 
ping and bulging again. His eyes 
stuck out to amazing dimensions. 

Groping for the spigot of the 
TrankwilSoda dispenser in the 
bottom drawer of his desk, Rhine- 
lander heard the taped metallic 
voice of his automatic secretary: 

“Please call Mr. Kuprin. Mr. 
Kuprin communicated at two 



minutes past nine, eight minutes 
past nine, fourteen minutes past 
nine and twenty-eight min — ” 

“Ah, God!” breathed Rhine- 
lander, slamming his hand on the 
stud that shut off the wretched 
voice. He swilled a tumbler of 
TrankwilSoda. It did no good 
whatever. 

He buried his head on his arms 
and tried to shut off his mind. 
Impossible. Argument with Wat- 
ty, wrecked Limoubus, smashed 
sculpture — all paled. He was face 
to face with the actual cause of his 
frustration. 

TTE could not avoid getting in 
touch with Kuprin. The eth- 
ics of the business demanded it. 
If he didn’t there would be talk. 
Talk could hurt. 

But perhaps the opening had 
flopped. Even as he reached for 
the hand microphone, he knew 
the opening had not flopped. He 
pressed the stud combination for 
Kuprin’s studio. A section of desk- 
top lifted. A screen swam and 
blurred. Presently a thin, wild- 
haired man in a smock, his face 
smeared with daubs of ochre, ap- 
peared. 

“Good morning, Nels. Seen the 
reviews?” 

“No, I have not. You know I 
wouldn’t concern myself with 
such trash. Who is this Caul any- 
how? Who’s heard of him?” 

“The whole art world, by now,” 



ONE-RACE SHOW 



167 



said Kuprin with a nasty little 
smile. 

“Why are you badgering me? 
Just because I shaved the price 
on that lousy gesso item you flim- 
flammed me into buying in 
August?” 

“I merely thought you’d be in- 
terested in the opening of the 
Caul show!” Kuprin pulled some 
gobs of paint off his nose. “You 
really must see it, Nels.” 

“Go to Swallows’s? I never go 
to other galleries.” 

“For this you must. The can- 
vases — well, have you ever 
looked at hell?” 

“Several good facsimilies,” said 
Rhinelander, thinking of his wife 
and Watty. 

“They’re really remarkable. 
When the rest of us are polite, full 
of form and balance — ” Kuprin 
swayed a little, weaving illusions 
with his paint-smeared hands — 
“this man, whoever he is, wher- 
ever he is, has visions of night- 
mares. Ugly. Terrible. Horrid. No 
landscapes like his exist on earth 
any more, with everything so 
beautiful and aseptic. But some- 
where this Caul saw such scenes. 
I’m a little sick.” From behind his 
immense spectacles, Kuprin 
glanced sidewise at Rhinelander 
through the screen. “Certainly 
this makes Swallows the pre-emi- 
nent gallery in the city, perhaps 
even in the world. 

Jealousy wrenched Rhineland- 



er’s gut. “The stuff’s really that 
good, eh?” 

“Marvelous, marvelous.” 

“I haven’t got time.” 

“Don’t be petty, Nels. It’s a 
shame you couldn’t have snared 
Caul.” 

“Caul, who the hell is Caul?” 
Rhinelander shouted. “Whoever 
heard of him before?” 

“Apparently Swallows did, one 
way or another. I understand 
there are even lines around the 
block. Can you imagine? Lines, 
for an exhibit of paintings! Well 
. .” Kuprin waved in a vague 
, way. “I suppose I might as well go 
back to work, although I doubt 
there’ll be much market for my 
stuff in the next few months. Not 
at the best galleries, certainly. 
Swallows doesn’t need me. I’ll 
show you what I’m doing, when 
it’s further along.” 

Kuprin promptly switched off, 
leaving Rhinelander to fume be- 
fore the blank screen. He knew at 
last that he could no longer dodge 
the source of his feelings on this 
rottenest of all rotten mornings. 

For weeks the art world had 
buzzed with rumors of the new 
show soon to open at Swallows’s. 
Rhinelander, not wanting to be- 
lieve, had tortured himself into 
believing. And it had all come 
true. But who was Joe Caul? 
Who’d ever heard of Joe Caul? 

Rhinelander sent for biographi- 
cal tapes. 



168 



GALAXY 



No painter named Joe Caul 
existed. 

Then Rhinelander sent for the 
morning reviews. 

They made him foam. 

Rhinelander, finally, sent for 
his Limoubus. He would, to tor- 
ture himself further, have a look 
at Joe Caul’s hell. 

II 

T ET it be said in Rhinelander’s 
favor that Joe Caul over- 
whelmed him. 

A thin drizzle was falling when 
Rhinelander reached the ivory 
and platinum front of The Fred- 
eric Swallows Gallery. Doubtless 
the weather service felt it was 
time for a little rain, but the rain 
made Rhinelander mad, especial- 
ly since he had to wait in a damp, 
shuffling line of customers that 
stretched half way around the 
square. 

Most of the students in line had 
come with portable rain-deflect- 
ors. They were in a holiday mood, 
buzzing with talk about the Caul 
canvases which they would soon 
be privileged to view. Rhineland- 
er felt his dignity violated by this 
forced mingling with members of 
the public. And then, just as his 
section of the line reached the 
great Swallows doors, the tower 
blowers came on and all the arti- 
ficial rain clouds were swept 
away, leaving the streets gold and 



gleaming in the sudden over- 
whelming sun. 

Feeling spongy, Rhinelander 
would have hated Michelangelo 
himself. So it was a strong reflec- 
tion on Rhinelander’s character 
and Joe Caul’s brush technique 
when he was overwhelmed in 
spite of the fact that the gallery 
attendant hadn’t even honored 
his trade courtesy card, but had 
made him pay admission just like 
anybody else. 

Rhinelander was not only over- 
whelmed, he was awed and fright- 
ened too. Caul’s canvases brought 
the stink of animal fear, raw as a 
piece of decomposing liver, into 
the refinement of Swallows’s main 
hall. 

Few spoke while viewing the 
Caul works. Swallows had, by de- 
sign, reduced the lighting so that 
only the canvases themselves, 
huge panels a uniform twenty by 
ten, stood out against ebony 
drapes. Knots of art-lovers hud- 
dled together, soaked and struck 
dumb, under each of the five 
works. Their faces held none of 
the joy or exhilaration some sen- 
sitive souls show when gazing up- 
on a new or revolutionary work. 
Instead, eyes gleamed wetly. 
Mouths hung loose and even a 
little moronically. 

For in each of the five works, 
signed in block .letters and black 
oil, Joe Caul, and labelled crudely

5, those who looked saw no 
heightened reality or beauty. 
They saw nothing they could 
measure by any customary yard- 
stick. They saw instead, a height- 
ening of sickness. They saw in- 
sanity made two-dimensional. 

“Evil filth,” Rhinelander whis- 
pered. But he couldn’t tear his 
eyes away from Pictur 1 to gaze 
at Pictur 2, the first was so power- 
ful. 

\/dEWS of hell? Rhinelander 
” knew the description was far 
too simple. Hell, as all the sophis- 
ticated spectators knew, was a 
fictitious place, like Amusement 
Land on the West Coast. The 
writhing purple and green and 
orange creatures, only dimly 
human, shrouded in pestilential 
vapors and frozen like hideous 
Laocoons, had a peculiar realism 
that made Rhinelander think to 
himself, This is ghastly; then, 
This is beautiful; then This is 
totally, utterly real — whatever it 
is. 

Under the spell of the canvases 
which seemed merely different 
views of the same subject (what- 
ever that was, besides reality) 
Rhinelander found himself both 
repelled and fascinated. Repelled 
by the labyrinthine weaving of 
shape and color, suggesting ever 
so many indecent images. Fasci- 
nated by the sledgehammer reali- 
zation that, although he didn’t 



quite understand, he was face to 
face with total truth. 

Let it further be said in Rhine- 
lander’s favor that he gazed at 
each of the pictures for at least 
twenty minutes without once feel- 
ing envy. At last, however, busi- 
ness concerns became too great. 
He tottered out of the exhibit 
hall, looking back as though ex- 
pecting one of Caul’s creatures to 
be roosting on his shoulder. Final- 
ly free of the grip of the paintings, 
he ended up in the office of Fred- 
eric Swallows, with Mr. Swallows 
on page by his autosecretary. 

Fortunately Swallow’s office 
was along an outer wall. Sunlight 
poured in and helped dispel the 
obscene guilt which Rhinelander 
had been feeling. It took only a 
moment for his regular nature to 
assert itself. He started pawing 
through papers and memoranda 
on top of Swallows’ ornate desk, 
searching for a clue to the elusive 
Caul. 

His cheeks puffed suddenly. 
He’d found something. 

Caul, the slip said. Plus Geneva 
Credit Depository. 43-1289-66. 

One of those numbered bank 
accounts? Rhinelander wondered. 
He heard footfalls in the outer 
corridor. Hastily he stuffed the 
slip back under a pile in its ori- 
ginal place. He was lighting up a 
dollar Nirvanatella when Frede- 
ric Swallows whisked in like corn 
husks rustling on a stalk. 



170 



GALAXY 



66T HARDLY expected you, 
Nels,” Swallows said. His 
hair was white, his face still 
whiter, his hands laced with blue 
veins. He was ninety-six years 
old, kept alive by nutrient cos- 
metics and injections of hor- 
mones. Swallows dry-washed his 
hands briskly and pursed his lips. 
“You are not noted for your mag- 
nanimity, old friend. One would 
have thought you would have 
stayed away.” 

“From — from that?” Rhine- 
lander waved outward. “Impos- 
sible. All I’ve heard about Joe 
Caul is absolutely true. I congrat- 
ulate you, Frederic.” 

Swallows nodded. “You’re 
right, you’re right. Once, in my 
youth, when I was taking drugs 
and painting in Tahiti, I saw one 
or two visions something like 
those pictures. I was so appalled 
I committed myself to a sanitari- 
um. When I was cured, I thought 
about trying to recapture a little 
of what I’d seen. The prospect 
was so grisly that I remained 
drunk for three months. I’ve 
never had the impulse again.” 

Swallows began to bustle and 
pry among the papers on the 
desktop. “Yes, I’m flattered that 
Caul, whoever he is, chose to send 
his paintings to me. He must have 
picked my name from the gallery 
directory. That was a lucky 
chance, eh, Nels?” From under 
the litter of memoranda, he drew 



out the slip at which Rhinelander 
had been peeking. “Excuse me.” 
Since Swallows’s eyesight was 
so weak, he had to turn his back 
to the window and hold the paper 
to the tip of his nose, in the sun’s 
beam. At that moment a window- 
washer’s platform slid into view 
on the face of the building. The 
washer was scribbing busily. He 
had an immense fan beard of red 
and wore a hearing apparatus. 
Rhinelander tried to remember 
when, if ever, he had seen a win- 
dow-washer. When he was a 
child? Swallows forced the papers 
against his eyes, then tittered. 

“Ah, yes, this is the one. Excuse 
me, excuse me.” 

The window-washer’s platform 
vanished upward out of sight. 
Rhinelander was no longer pay- 
ing attention, for his brains had 
suddenly fastened on a remark 
the old man had made a minute 
before. He watched Swallows 
waggle one foot in the air, make a 
few quick passes with his left 
hand, open the visual safe and 
pop the slip inside. Casual, now, 
Rhinelander thought. Very casual. 
He cleared his throat. 

“Frederic, did you say you 
don’t know this Caul personally?” 

66T DID, I did, old friend,” said 
Swallows, meaning, old en- 
emy. 

“He selected your gallery at 
random?” 



ONE-RACE SHOW

Swallows lifted 'a shoulder- 
blade. “I suppose so. How else to 
explain the sudden arrival of five 
massive crates one day last 
month? A day later came a note, 
with ten cents postage due. Ludi- 
crously written. This Caul can 
barely spell. Witness ‘pictur’. In 
his illiterate hand he informed me 
that something made him want to 
show his works, and if I deemed 
them of any value I should depo- 
sit funds in one of those secret 
Swiss bank accounts, whose num- 
ber he conveniently provided. 
The numbers were so miserably 
written I had to try seven ac- 
counts before hitting the correct 
one. Some clever advisor has 
doubtless told this Caul, wherever 
and whoever he may be, about 
numbered accounts. His own 
hand — I had it analyzed — proves 
he’s something above an imbecile, 
but only a little something. Very 
strange, very peculiar.” 

“Have you heard from Caul 
again?” Rhinelander asked. He 
felt better now, almost wolfish as 
his mind repeated, to fix it firm, 
43 - 1289 - 66 . 

“No, but I certainly hope I 
shall. If I never sell another can- 
vas in my lifetime, Caul’s five pic- 
tures will make me comfortable. I 
might even say wealthy.” Swal- 
lows ruffled a few more paper and 
chits. “I do appreciate your stop- 
ping, Nels. Drop in again when- 
ever you wish. But I have at least 



a hundred letters from various 
museums requesting chromostats 
of one or all of the Caul canvases, 
plus proofs of a critique I’ve just 
written, and — oh.” Swallows 
blinked again, as though he had 
just remembered a formality of 
the profession. “How’s your busi- 
ness?” 

“Very brisk,” Rhinelander said 
with a smile, hate boiling his guts. 

“Too bad you couldn’t have 
gotten Caul. Pure chance, though. 
Well, good day.” 

“Yes, too bad,” Rhinelander 
echoed. He shook the old man’s 
spidery hand and passed out of 
the office thinking, 43 - 1289 - 66 . 

With a shudder he walked be- 
neath Picturs 1 through 5 and 
didn’t look up. He didn’t want to 
be unnerved again. He was feel- 
ing too rich, too hot-headed, too 
sure and exhilarated. 

“Too bad,” he said again as he 
shoved his way through the 
crowds still waiting outside. At 
the end of the building he paused, 
looked both ways, spat on the 
platinum gallery name-plate. 

“F orty - three, twelve - eighty - 
nine, sixty-six, you old bastard. 
I haven’t got him now. But I soon 
will have.” 

Ill 

A T the evening dinner Rhine- 
lander’s wife Iris had one of 
her shrieking spells.

GALAXY 



The meal began cordially 
enough. Artificial sunset filtered 
through the pergola that over- 
looked the pool, where mechani- 
cal swans floated in geometric 
patterns. Iris, Rhinelander and 
Watty reclined on their couches, 
eating roast duckling with orange 
sauce. 

Iris brought up the subject of a 
party she was giving in a few 
weeks. She planned to turn the 
entire house and estate, including 
Rhinelander’s wing, into an ex- 
tinct Asian commune. Watty, 
wearing only shorts and several 
bandages from the race, sucked 
on gobbets of duckling and ap- 
peared indifferent. Rhinelander 
struggled up from his couch to 
protest the party. 

In the phony sunset light Iris 
looked disgusting to Rhinelander. 
No longer a young woman, she in- 
sisted on dyeing her hair a dif- 
ferent shade each month. This 
month it was pea-green. She wore 
tight scarlet trousers woven with 
platinum threads and a blouse 
which revealed her large flabby 
bosom. Her nails were three 
inches long. Rhinelander cared 
for her only occasionally. To- 
night was not one of the occasions. 

“I won’t have my house tricked 
out to resemble some socialistic 
experiment, Iris.” 

Iris clamped her sharp little 
teeth on her lower lip and tried 
to show patience. “Darling, can’t 



you at least look at the clever 
plans?” 

As if on signal, a young crea- 
ture in pink drawers and a cos- 
metic suntan burst in at the per- 
gola entrance. He began to unroll 
sheafs of brownprints. The sight 
of Yoggemeyer, Iris’s personal 
decorator, infuriated Rhinelander 
even more. 

“I refuse to look at them!” He 
kicked over a platter of duckling. 
Yoggemeyer minced aside, nearly 
getting his lacquered toes slop- 
ping up with orange sauce. 

"1JF7ATTY chuckled, licking his 
’’ fingers. “Obstinate tonight, 
aren’t we, Nels?” 

“You keep out of this, play- 
boy!” Rhinelander snarled. 

“Dear Nels,” Watty said, prop- 
ping up on one elbow. “I should 
to do that. But you make it im- 
possible. A moment ago you said 
you wouldn’t have ‘y° ur ’ house 
redesigned to accommodate my 
sister’s desires, but you really 
don’t have much choice. Let’s not 
have a scene, please. I had a hard 
day.” 

“Vertiracing?” Rhinelander 
sneered. “Pah. Playing games.” 

“Facing more reality that you 
possibly could," Watty said. 

“Anyway,” Rhinelander said, 
“we’ve gone this route before. The 
house and estate are registered in 
my name, and therefore — ” 

“Please,” Yoggemeyer cooed, 



ONE-RACE SHOW 



173 



“if you’d just glance at these cun- 
ning plans — ” 

“Get the hell out of here!” 
Rhinelander threw half of the 
duckling at the decorator. Yogge- 
meyer squealed, his head covered 
with ooze and raisins, and disap- 
peared sobbing behind the hedges. 

This set Iris to flexing her 
claws. She paced back and forth, 
a raw edge on her never very 
soothing voice: 

“Isaac Nels Rhinelander, we 
certainly have discussed the regis- 
tration before, and need I re- 
mind you that it’s my money, and 
my brother’s, which enables you 
to live in such luxury? I’ll decor- 
ate, and I’ll decorate any way I 
damned please!" 

“There,” Watty chortled. “Now 
can you confront reality or not, 
dear Nels?” 

For a moment Rhinelander’s 
eyes threatened to explode out of 
his head. His cheeks worked like 
bellows. He glared at the pair 
with hate brimming inside him. 
He wanted to smash their heads. 
He wanted to kill. To shut them 
up. To kill. To kill. To kill — 

But he managed to get control 
of his emotions. After all, he had 
Caul to consider. And the num- 
bered bank account. 

He lowered his sweating body 
back to the couch as Iris paced to 
the other side of the pergola, beat- 
ing her fists against her thighs. 
Rather nonsensically, too, Rhine- 



lander thought. Ah, things were 
calming down. 

A T that moment Watty noisily 
sucked some meat from a 
duckling leg. “You can’t face real- 
ity, Nels. Really you can’t. Few 
can. Care to debate?” 

And, unreasonably, Rhineland- 
er exploded again: 

“Yes, damn it, Watty. I’ll de- 
bate with you, you smug wastrel.” 
“You see?” Watty pointed with 
the bone. “I, at least, know where 
I’m going. Nowhere. Whereas you, 
destined for the same goal, think 
you’re going somewhere. That is 
precisely what I mean about real- 
ity. Take this morning. 

“Two vertiracers collided at 
the rally. Bloody goo all over the 
firing pad. A crowd gathered, bug- 
eyed. Why? Because, Nels, no 
one could actually believe that 
two human beings had been jel- 
lied. The people stared at the re- 
mains until they convinced them- 
selves of it. Then they went away. 
In an hour I’ll wager every one 
of them was certain again that he 
could never be jellied because 
those two wretches weren’t jellied 
either — it was all some sort of 
dismal dream. The mind simply 
refuses to accept some things, and 
invents all sorts of clever excuses 
for not doing so. Your mind, for 
example, refuses to accept two 
basic facts. One, that you have 
flimsy artistic tastes. Two, that 



174

you have no real business instinct. 
Therefore your gallery is, and al- 
ways will be, a monumental flop, 
sustained by the funds that Iris 
pours in.” 

“And do I pour them in!” Iris 
shrieked. “Oh, my God, do I!” 

“I could kill you,” Rhinelander 
said. “I could, Watty.” 

“Do you think that that sur- 
prises me?” 

Rhinelander stormed to his 
feet, bent toward Watty. “What if 
I admitted all you said? That so 
far I’ve never amounted to any- 
thing much? What if I said, all 
right, I know I exhibit second-rate 
items but now I’m on to some- 
thing of quality. Now I’m going to 
fight and scheme until I get my 
hands on it?” 

“Something of quality?” Watty 
was skeptical. “What might that 
be?” 

“More paintings by Joe Caul.” 
Never before had Rhinelander 
seen Watty show astonishment. 
“I’ve heard of the Caul things. 
Are there more than five?” 

“There may be, if I can unlock 
a numbered bank account in 
Switzerland.” 

“Impossible, Nels, old boy.” 
“All right,” Rhinelander said 
tightly. “I agree. See, I’m realistic. 
But you have the right connec- 
tions, Watty. And enough money. 
You could unlock the personnel 
dossier behind that account. If 
you wanted to do it badly enough. 



If you wanted to see whether or 
not I’d fail.” 

Rhinelander’s eyes narrowed 
now as he tried to gauge the effec- 
tiveness of his goad, his dare. 

“Would you like to gamble on 
my ineptitude, Watty? If you 
would, unlock- the account. That’s 
all I ask.” 

“It might be amusing to watch 
you fail.” 

“Take a chance, Watty?” 

Watty threw back his head and 
laughed. “Give me the number in 
the morning.” 

A TIDE of relief swept over 
Rhinelander. “Thank you, 
Watty,” he said as his mind ticked 
over a hundred cruel tortures he 
would enjoy inflicting on his 
brother-in-law in return for this 
particular bit of groveling. Emo- 
tions and luck had thrown Wat- 
ty’s help his way. Rhinelander felt 
a little stronger for having 
chanced and won. 

But he was deeply ashamed, 
too, because his emotions had 
been laid bare. 

Chewing on a piece of duckling 
as the rheostats began to fade out 
the sunsets, he heard Iris ap- 
proach, her heels ticking on the 
paving. His eyes were large, wet, 
carefully empty of emotion. 

“There will be a party, Nels,” 
Iris said. “It’s my money.” 

“There had better not be.” 

“There will be, there will be, 



ON E - R A C E SHOW 



175 



the will be,” he whispered, almost 
like a prayer. 

Rhinelander stuck his fingers 
in the pneumatic tubes of the san- 
itary unit next to his couch. 
Liquid jets and brushes cleaned 
off the duckling grease. He some- 
how felt a thousand miles away 
from this witch with green hair. 

“I don’t wish to talk about it 
any more.” 

But even as he promised him- 
self that one day he would kill 
Iris and Watty, he also realized 
he would never have the cour- 
age to do it. Small triumph only, 
he thought. Better than none, 
though. Watty think's I’ll fail. Re- 
ality? I can face it well enough. 
He’ll see. Still, the mixture of hate 
and doubt assailed him. 

Iris went shrieking off to con- 
sult Yoggemeyer, Watty to shoot 
a game of dimensional billiards. 
As the last of the festering light 
died behind the lattices Rhine- 
lander lay panting on the couch, 
rationalizing himself into believ- 
ing that more Caul canvases 
would be worth all this. 

TN the exalted orbits of leisure 

and finance in which Atwater 
Pope revolved, bribery was not 
bribery. 

It was a cordial cocktail at a 
wheel lounge spinning in space 
five hundred miles above Cape 
Fear. 

It was an exploratory luncheon 



at an inn among pine trees just 
outside Olde Manhattan Metrop- 
olis National Forest. 

It was a process in which the 
briber (never called that, of 
course) made a polite request, 
and the briber sent four or five 
dozen messages via the communi- 
cations mirrors whizzing around 
Earth, then suggested certain dis- 
creet investments. 

After a short interval, which 
allowed the bribee to get answers 
and the briber to gather up a 
small sinking fund of several mil- 
lions, a yachting party was ar- 
ranged in the ionosphere. Matters 
were brought to fruition over iced 
tonics on the infrared deck. Al- 
though the proceedings were 
wholly dishonest from start to 
finish, at least they were genteel. 

It took Watty eight and a half 
weeks to unlock the secret of 43- 
1289-66. 

And in those fifty-nine days the 
printing presses of the world ham- 
mered out matte finish reproduc- 
tions of Picturs 1 through 5, in 
twelve colors, on press runs up- 
wards of eighty million. 

A news service ran a simulpix 
of a Tibetan monk examining a 
print of Pictur 3 which had found 
its way into the crystal fastness on 
the back of a steel packass in the 
summer supply caravan. Abori- 
gines (what few were left) and 
intelligent school boys (even 
fewer) carried Joe Caul prints 



176

around with them, dreadfully fas- 
cinated. Earth crowned a new god 
of canvas, one whose work it 
could not quite understand. 

Editorials and clerical procla- 
mations decried the veiled horror 
of the new messiah of art. But not 
a single voice denied the awful 
something that was the truth of 
the pictures, pictures which pirate 
lithograph houses had to spew out 
by the bale in order to keep up 
with the demand. 

No one seemed to know the 
whereabouts of Joe Caul, at least 
publicly. This was due to the re- 
markable circumstance that no 
one, apparently, wished to find 
Joe Caul. If he were anything like 
his works, the unspoken feeling 
ran, best that he be left alone. 

But in every six billion rational 
people there is bound to be at 
least one Isaac Nels Rhinelander. 

He’d waited eight and a half 
weeks. He’d groveled before that. 
Now he was on the trail. 

IV 

r T'HE State of Industrial Jersey 
had an output amounting to 
one tenth of the GNP, and a resi- 
dent population of twenty-eight. 
Rhinelander had to hire a low- 
paid ranger from the forestry 
service at Olde Central to lead 
him into the wilderness of tower- 
ing automated factories, all alike 
except for their name signs and 



their products which went shoot- 
ing, cased, to every land via un- 
derground pneumatic systems. 

Industrial Jersey sprawled out 
beneath a depressing blanket of 
smog and drizzle. Even the ran- 
ger got lost twice in the empty 
cement canyons before he 
brought Rhinelander to Yummy- 
dinners Ltd. 

The one clear, traceable name 
written by Joe Caul when he had 
filled out the personnel dossier for 
Geneva Credit Depository six 
months ago was the name Hubert 
Elk. This appeared in a column 
headed Personal References. Be- 
side the name, Caul had scrawled: 
lended me $ for paints. Other 
vital sections — Current Address, 
Current Employer, Current Cable 
Code — Caul had left blank, shun- 
ning public attention. Well, now 
he had public attention, and 
Rhinelander had Hubert Elk, a 
portly man who shut off one lever 
marked Broasted Gooselet in Ar- 
tichokes Yummydinner and 
yanked another stencilled Toma- 
to Surprise Under Glass Yummy- 
dinner. 

Fidgety with impatience — Elk 
refused to be hurried — Rhine- 
lander watched the processes un- 
derway along the two-mile floor 
of the food works, six stories be- 
low the small bubble of an office. 
At one side of the vast cavern 
mammoth dump bins poured soya 
pods into funnels which led to 



ONE-RACE SHOW 



177 



hooded conveyors whose escape 
valves squirted occasional puffs of 
red steam. On the opposite side 
of the cavern, claw forks stacked 
bright cartons of Gooselet Yum- 
mydinners onto skids which were 
then blasted down distribution 
tubes with small rocket charges. 
When Elk switched from produc- 
tion of one Yummydinner to an- 
other the dump-bins continued to 
pour out soya pods but the pack- 
aged goods which emerged had 
become Tomato Surprises, plastic 
glass bells included. 

“About Joe Caul” Rhinelander 
dragged his gaze away from the 
belches of red steam which re- 
minded him of Pictur 4. “You are 
the Hubert Elk with whom Joe 
Caul was once — ah — associated?” 
“Right, that’s me.” Elk picked 
his teeth. “Owner and sole opera- 
tor of Yummydinners. Caul used 
to work for me.” He glanced at 
Rhinelander’s enameled card a- 
gain. “Art dealer, huh? I heard 
something about Caul and his pic- 
tures. He used to paint around 
here, too. Why?” 

“As an art dealer, I wish to 
develop — ah — greater public ap- 
preciation of his remarkable tal- 
ents. I wish to locate him. So that 
I can purchase more of his pic- 
tures.” 

t'LK guffawed. From behind a 
bank of instruments he 
dragged a small canvas whose 



subject was a water spaniel, done 
with syrupy realism in garish 
tones of yellow and rust. Rhine- 
lander recoiled from its wetter- 
than-life tongue. 

“Oh, come now, Mr. Elk. Caul 
didn’t paint that.” 

“He certainly did,” Elk said 
testily. “I watched him do it. 
After all, he worked for me, didn’t 
he? Plus eight or nine other fac- 
tories.” 

“Not as an artist, surely?” 

“Nope. Janitor. Swept out the 
office here.” Elk waved at the 
clanking conveyors far below. 
“What else could he do in a place 
like this?” 

“Y ou seriously expect me to be- 
lieve Joe Caul painted works of 
this sort?” 

“If you don’t believe me, here’s 
the signature. You have to look 
close. Down in the corner. ‘Joe 
Caul.’ ” 

Aghast, Rhinelander saw that 
it was so. 

Elk turned smug. “Didn’t I tell 
you? He painted dogs, mostly. 
When it wasn’t dogs, it was angels 
and martyrs. Caul wasn’t too 
bright, you understand. How 
could a man be, and be a regular 
resident of this place? I haven’t 
seen any of his pictures all the 
papers are talking about, except 
for one they ran in black and 
white. Didn’t look like Joe Caul’s 
stuff to me, at least not the Joe 
Caul I knew before the accident.” 



178 



GALAXY 



“Accident?” Rhinelander’s 
cheeks quivered. “What sort of 
accident? When?” 

“Sub-reactor on the synthesizer 
belt vibrated its shield bolts loose. 
Caul had swept up here and was 
on his way over to Blumenthal 
Better Ball Bearings to do the 
same. He got burned in the atom 
shower. Of course we rushed him 
to the autodoctor to get the 
charge neutralized. Only trouble 
was, I found out later the ma- 
chine was due for overhaul that 
next week. Some of its tapes were 
a mite worn. Caul didn’t seem bad 
off after the accident, but he had 
trouble sleeping nights. Slept like 
a top before. I was going to cash 
his compensation for him, send 
him to a clinic to check the work 
the autodoc had done — hell of a 
bother, but it’s these Goddamn 
bureaucratic laws we got — but by 
then Caul was committed.” 

“Committed?” Rhinelander’s 
eyes began to bulge. His nostrils 
grew big as dimes. You don’t 
mean to some sort of therapeutic 
farm?” 

“None other than Thlex,” said 
Elk, with another smug nod. 

“Narcotics? Caul was on nar- 
cotics?” (That would explain 
some of the visions. Some, but by 
no means all.) “How did you find 
this out?” 

“Why, Caul told me. He had 
dreams, he said. Couldn’t sleep, 
but he had dreams. Imagine that. 



So he robbed one of those robo- 
pushers always parked around the 
turnpike entrances, and got 
hooked. That was two years ago.” 

T^LK rose and peered at a pres- 
sure gauge imbedded in a 
wall bank. “Hell, I was glad to see 
him leave Industrial Jersey. He 
wasn’t the only one had insomnia. 
Soon as I brought him back from 
the autodoc I couldn’t get more 
than two hours a night myself. 
Toss, turn, thinking of my inlaws, 
production problems, worry, 
worry, worry. Must of felt respon- 
sible for Caul’s trouble. Anyway, 
when he committed himself to try 
and shake the habit, I began to 
sleep sound, again. Shows you 
how the Goddamn spenders who 
run this country can make a man 
feel guilty if he doesn’t wipe the 
nose of any stumblebum who 
sweeps up his shop. Caul’s prob- 
ably still in Thlex for all I know. 
Good riddance. After he was 
burned, I couldn’t even stand to 
look at him.” For a moment Elk’s 
eyes looked far beyond Rhine- 
lander to something ghastly. Then 
the mood passed. 

“Excuse me now, mister. Time 
for the three o’clock changeover.” 

Rhinelander attempted to 
thank Elk but the latter was oc- 
cupied with another lever labeled 
Grape Aphrodisia Gelatin Yum- 
mydinner, With Extra Vine 
Leaves Included. Rhinelander let

himself out of the office bubble. 
He ran down the automatic stairs 
to the exit where the ranger was 
waiting for him in the rain. 

As they walked along the ran- 
ger said, “Find what you were 
after?” 

“I most certainly did.” In his 
mind, Rhinelander saw himself 
delivering punches to Watty 
Pope’s groin. “Let’s hurry. I must 
catch a flight for Kentucky as 
soon as possible. I — good heav- 
ens! Look at that!” 

On a corner between auto- 
mated factories a man with a 
huge red beard was selling news- 
sheets from a portable stand. Not 
actually selling them. Merely 
standing there holding an ear 
trumpet to the right side of his 
head while the rain turned the 
newssheets spongy. All at once 
the bearded man caught sight of 
Rhinelander and the ranger. He 
scuttled out of sight around the 
corner of a factory, kicking over 
his stand as he went. 

The ranger shook his head. 
“Crazy. Who reads papers out 
here, I wonder?” 

“These aren’t even papers,” 
Rhinelander said, stooping to pick 
up the top sheet. All the letters 
including the masthead were 
greeked. The reverse side of the 
page was blank. The bundle un- 
derneath was compressed excel- 
sior. Rhinelander felt a shiver of 
fright chase down his spine. He 



looked around the corner. The 
red-bearded man had vanished 
into the rain and the empty con- 
crete distances. 

HPHE only staff professional at 
Thlex who had time to talk 
with Rhinelander was a Second 
Assistant Staff Recreationist 
named Dr. T. T. Wu. And he 
clearly demonstrated that he was 
none too happy about the assign- 
ment by reminding Rhinelander 
two seconds after they met that 
Thlex received a minimum of ten 
thousand patients a week. Rhine- 
lander could well believe it. 

At Central Administration in 
Lexington City he had made a 
generous donation of some of 
Iris’s money. It had then taken 
him two hours by rotor to reach 
Dr. Wu’s section, five counties 
away, because nearly three-quar- 
ters of the state was occupied by 
the national narcotics hospital. 
The gently rolling landscape, all 
sunlit green hills and long grass, 
swarmed with thousands of fig- 
ures in white gowns wandering to 
and fro like extras in some epic 
from Hollywood-on-the-Tiber. 

Dr. Wu’s irritation showed on 
his young, lemon-colored face. He 
and Rhinelander had to walk two 
miles before they found an unoc- 
cupied bench, where they could 
chat. 

“I can give you only ten min- 
utes, please, Mr. Rhinelander,” 



180 



GALAXY 



Wu said. “At ten I am directing 
six hundred of our inmates in a 
Shakespearian therapy.” Wu 
pinched his upper nose. “Going 
badly, too. Our lumber mill was 
supposed to have delivered the 
Birnam Wood costumes last 
Tuesday. All I get is excuses, ex- 
cuses, excuses. Let’s see.” 

Wu dug into his smock for a 
card. “Hmmm. Quite a substantial 
donation. I’m no public relations 
man, but I suppose I must co- 
operate.” 

Rhinelander said irritably, “I 
had hoped the donation might 
facilitate — ” 

“When we release a thousand 
patients a week only to get ten 
thousand?” Wu’s little chestnut 
eyes snapped in the Kentucky 
sun. “God pity our staff if we 
ever have a depression, Mr. 
Rhinelander. Then we’ll really be 
jammed. Now we have only the 
social cases. Those in the exurbs 
who try it for kicks and then — but 
time is wasting.” Another glance 
at the card. “Caul, was it? Ah, yes, 
Caul, Caul. Low status, I recall. 
No education, no money, no chil- 
dren, no mistresses. No reason to 
become addicted. Here three 
weeks. Had to release him.” 

“Cured?” Rhinelander was dis- 
appointed. A confirmed addiction 
might explain the haunting, evil 
quality of the Picturs, but a recon- 
structed addiction — 

Wu shook his head. “Totally 



hopeless. Besides, he caused 
riots.” 

Rhinelander’s eyebrows shot 
up. “Riots?” 

“Yes, riots. Among his village 
mates. When Caul arrived they 
began to complain of sleepless- 
ness. As did Caul himself. Caul 
was completely uncooperative. 
Stayed up all night painting. Big, 
psychotic pictures. Three of them 
while he was here. One of our in- 
mates looked at Caul’s work and 
went into a screaming fit. ‘I know 
what that is!’ he screamed. Two 
nights later he murdered three 
matrons and escaped over the 
Ohio. He drowned trying to swim 
to a roadside fix stand on the 
other side. 

“The man had been partially 
cured, too,” Wu added snappish- 
ly. “Well, I simply don’t have 
time to stand for such regressive 
nonsense. So after the patients be- 
gan to riot — the first riot broke 
out one night when Caul dis- 
played his canvases after mess — 
I obtained an executive order. I 
crated his nightmarish work and 
shipped it, and Caul as well, to 
the place we send all our incur- 
ables.” 

TJHINELANDER batted away

and looping around his nose. His 
whole body erupted in perspira- 
tion. His heart jackhammered un-

stared at his sandals, at the sky, 
at his nails, at several inmates act- 
ing out their hostilities by playing 
freeway drivers in a nearby glade. 
Rhinelander thought: What luck! 
A physician too idealistic by half, 
too caught up and concerned with 
his charges to know, even now, 
what a find he once had in the 
person and the paintings of Joe 
Caul. Carefully Rhinelander said: 

“To what place do you send 
your incurables, Dr. Wu?” 

Wu stood up. “Denver. The 
Monastery of Positive Thinking. 
It’s for incipient and developed 
insanity. Caul reached the latter 
state shortly upon arrival. If 
you’ll pardon me, I must check 
up on Birnam Wood. Your dona- 
tion is appreciated, but it still 
hardly makes a dent. Send me a 
new lumber-mill foreman in- 
stead.” Off he went into the dap- 
pled sunlight falling through the 
magnolias. 

Starting up a hillside toward 
the rotor park, Rhinelander got a 
jolt. Stenciled against the sky, an 
attendant wheeled an empty pa- 
tient’s chair. The attendant had 
something resembling a jeweler’s 
loupe screwed into his left eye. 
His reddish beard flapped in the 
hot wind. 

Rhinelander began to run. 
“Wait, you! Wait just a moment! 
Stand still, I tell you.” 

But the bearded man was 
younger and more agile than 



Rhinelander. He tipped over his 
chair, flung off his white smock 
and jackrabbited away over an- 
other hill. Rhinelander puffed af- 
ter him, but got only as far as the 
chair whose wheel revolved lazily 
and caught the sun in chrome 
glints. He was panting too hard 
to run further. 

Leaves stirred in the woods 
into which the figure had van- 
ished. Rhinelander wished he 
were nearer an analytical lab that 
could, for a fee, get hold of the 
perspiration index left on the 
chair’s handgrips. Who was that 
damned spook with the red 
beard? 

Some flunky Watty had hired 
to check on the success or failure 
of Rhinelander’s search? 

Yes, that must be! Rhinelander 
mopped his face and pursed his 
lips in a little smile. He could feel 
his blood pressure mounting as he 
thought of Watty and Iris but he 
calmed himself by thinking: 

Denver. Denver. When he 
shook a fist at the blue sky, it was 
the fist of a victor. 

V 

T> HINELANDER’S sense of 
victory was so complete he 
couldn’t resist sending Watty a 
message before he took off from 
Thlex. He reported his destina- 
tion, reported that he had located 
Joe Caul, reported that within a 



182 



GALAXY 



day he would most certainly have 
Joe Caul signed to the exclusive 
management and representation 
of The Rhinelander Galleries. See 
how Watty liked that. 

As the sonicliner whined down 
over Denver through a sundown 
sky all gold and royal purple, 
Rhinelander munched a Digest-o- 
tab provided by the stewardesses 
to help get rid of the sixteen 
courses of the flight meal. He re- 
flected that soon he would prove 
once and for all that he was really 
a clever and resourceful person. 

A short twelve miles by limou- 
bus from Denver and he reached 
the sprawling onion towers of the 
Monastery of Positive Thinking. 
It was twilight. Motorized doves 
wheeled above the chapel. The 
carillon rang out the strains of 
Smiles. 

As Rhinelander entered the 
gate he saw a platoon of the 
brothers marching briskly 
through a cloister. Barefoot, each 
wore impeccable flannel habila- 
ments. Each was whistling in an 
optimistic way. Rhinelander had 
heard about the order. Its breth- 
ren were mainly hopelessly insane 
advertising executives. Their 
tranquility was achieved through 
the use of drugs. Nevertheless, 
the entire scene had a refreshing 
spiritual air which Rhinelander 
enjoyed. 

A novice asked him to wait in 
the garden until Evening Plans- 



board was finished. Rhinelander 
sat on a marble bench in the 
piney mountain evening at the 
foot of a bronze statue of the 
great hospitaler himself, J. Walter 
Thorngate. The hands of the 
figure were widespread in a ges- 
ture of invitation to the figure of 
an ailing consumer lying at his 
feet. 

Before he knew it Rhinelander 
was joined by a stately monk 
with a crew cut and horn-rims. He 
introduced himself in a cheerful 
way as Brother Buzz, the Vice 
President in Charge of Intraven- 
ous Equipment. 

“Your inquiry isn’t precisely in 
my bailiwick,” said Brother Buzz 
with a warm smile, “but since 
we’re a team here, all involved in 
caring for the incurable and so 
forth, I’m sure I can help put a 
little zing back in your swing.” 

“Thank you, thank you,” 
Rhinelander replied. “I’d like to 
talk with one of your patients. I 
believe his name is Caul.” 

“Joe? A swell guy. But then 
they’re all swell guys.” Brother 
Buzz, however, could not suppress 
a gentle frown. “Unfortunately 
he’s our unhappiest ward. Com- 
plains constantly that the fellows 
on the team think pure white 
thoughts. But of course we do." 
Brother Buzz laid his arm across 
Rhinelander’s shoulders. “We’ve 
zeroed in on the great truths, my 
friend. When we send positive

thinking up the flagpole, every 
man on the team salutes. Actually 
you won’t be able to see Joe until 
after the morning meal. The pa- 
tients have retired for the night.” 
“Oh. But he’s here, isn’t he?” 
“Of course.” 

TVTOW Rhinelander became very 
^ ' careful. “Brother Buzz, may 
I ask what may seem a question. 
Do you and your brothers have 
any contact with the outside 
world? That is to say, I mean 
specifically the world of art. You 
see, I’m an art dealer.” 

“The world of art? No, we’re 
totally divorced from the world 
outside. We have no paintings 
here except for an original Rock- 
well in the narthex. However — ” 
Brother Buzz shook his head — 
“I’m sorry you have made the trip 
for nothing, because that work is 
not for sale at any price.” 

Rhinelander suppressed a gig- 
gle. “All I want is to talk to Caul, 
please.” 

“Then you shall.” Brother Buzz 
stood up and fished among the 
folds of his robe. “I’ll show you 
where you can sleep. I regret the 
surroundings are modest, but our 
order believes that existence 
should be one single, harmonious 
ball of wax. In the meantime, you 
may be interested in this message. 
Our supply rotor dropped it along 
with our consignment of Gruel 
Yummydinners shortly after six.” 



Rhinelander did not untold tne 
slip until Brother Buzz had led 
him to the guest cell, and drawn 
Rhinelander’s Gruel Yummydin- 
ner from the dumbwaiter. A beam 
of red sunlight came through the 
bars of the cell and lit up the let- 
ters of the message like flame: 

GLAD TO LOCATE YOU IN 
TIME TO REPORT PARTY 
GOING SPLENDIDLY. YOUR 
PRIVATE POOL NOW PART 
OF SPLENDID RICE PADDY. 
GOVERNOR STEMPLE HIM- 
SELF APPEARING AS LEAD- 
ER OF COMMUNE! CHAM-

FUSES TO BELIEVE UNTIL 
THE SIXTH PICTUR IS 
HUNG AT RHINELANDER^. 
I’D BE WITH HIM, EXCEPT 
HAVING TOO DELIRIOUS A 
TIME COMMUNIZING TO 
THINK ABOUT IT. IRIS. 

“God damn,” Rhinelander said. 
Then more vehemently, “Oh, God 
damn her.” The arrogant message 
triggered him like a bomb. He 
raged and stamped up and down 
his cell with his mind a turmoil of 
humiliation and rage. 

Redecorate his house, would 
she? 

Against his wishes, would she? 

Bitch! Flagrant, arrogant bitch. 

Her money, her money, her 
money, he sneered to himself. Oh, 



184 



GALAXY 



yes — but not for long. Not when I 
sign Caul tomorrow! 

TN a spasm of fury, Rhinelander 

kicked over the plastic wash 
stand with its metal bowl, towel, 
straight razor and bar of shaving 
soap. Then he stamped on the 
bowl until he bent it totally out of 
shape. 

And Watty, he thought. Still 
thinks I’ll fail. Still, still, still. 

Rhinelander hurled the closed 
razor at the wall with a low 
scream of rage. Only the sound of 
the carillon pealing out Happy 
Days Are Here Again over the 
mountains prevented Rhineland- 
er’s noise from upsetting the en- 
tire monastery. At last, sobbing, 
he sank down on his pallet and 
blew out the single candle. 

But he could not sleep. 

He wanted to sleep. Something 
seemed to be sucking at his mind 
as he lay in the cool dark. Pulling 
and sucking and draining, until he 
could hardly move. He felt limp, 
exhausted. But his mind refused 
to accept this exhaustion. Instead, 
it conjured up tortures and inde- 
cencies and obscenities and cruel- 
ties committed upon the persons 
of Iris and Watty, tortures and in- 
decencies and obscenities and cru- 
elties of a magnitude which 
startled even Rhinelander’s own 
soggy, hate-purpled self. At last, 
snuffling and weeping, he fell into 
a fitful light sleep. 



Yet in that stage, foggy demons 
flew around inside his head. 

“You,” the voice was whisper- 
ing. A wet, loose-lipped sound. 
“You, you.” 

Rhinelander sat bolt upright. 
He was bathed in cold sweat. 

Through the cell window a 
shaft of icy moonlight fell on the 
cell floor. Rhinelander tottered 
toward the door. There was a hor- 
rid crawling on his spine. His 
hand trembled as he reached for 
the latchstring. When Rhine- 
lander opened the door and 
shrank back, his visitor shambled 
inside. 

The visitor stood in the moon- 
beam, spittle gleaming on his lips. 
Rhinelander’s legs turned to jelly. 

The visitor was a bent, flaccid 
man in his middle forties, pale 
with a face like suet. He stood 
looking foolishly at Rhinelander. 
His big eyes seemed to have cav- 
erns behind them. His feet, stick- 
ing out of shabby gray work trou- 
sers, were dirty, as if he were too 
imbecilic to give himself good 
care. Then Rhinelander saw the 
fresh daubs of color on the toes, 
on the trousers, on the tattered 
shirt. Finally, he saw what the 
man held, as the man brought it 
forward like a Mongoloid child 
displaying a bauble. 

“Joe Caul,” Rhinelander said. 

“Thankee,” said Joe Caul. “Ye 
helped me paint again. Many 
thanks.” 



ONE-RACE SHOW 



185 



And he showed the small can- 
vas. 

T> HINELANDER covered his 
face and fell shrieking 
against the cold stone wall. 

“Turn it around, for Christ’s 
sake. It’s filthy.” 

Joe Caul blinked. “That’s 
queer. A man calling himself 
dirt.” 

“What do you — no, don’t come 
any closer! What do you mean?” 
“I painted what I seed in your 
head tonight. I don’t see things in 
the heads of them monks. They 
got pure white heads. Drugs or 
suthin’. What’s wrong with a fel- 
ler paintin’ what he sees, huh?” 
“What do you mean, you saw 
that?” Rhinelander howled. 

Caul blinked innocently. “Why 
just like it always is, since the 
burn back when I was with Elk. I 
can’t sleep no more. But when I 
close my eyes, I see. Finally I 
figured out what I seen. It must 
be inside heads. It must be,” Caul 
repeated in his pleading whine. 
“Don’t noplace in the world have 
crawly sights like that. One of the 
fellers at Thlex unnerstood. He 
unnerstood why I had to have 
drugs. Only way I know to get rid 
of this.” Caul wagged the picture 
again. Rhinelander retched. 

“Only way’s to paint it. Jesus 
— ” Caul was nearly weeping in 
the steel-blue moonlight now — 
“wisht I could paint a dog again. 



All I can see is this here. Awful. 
Take it!” Caul thrust the painting 
forward at Rhinelander. His voice 
shrilled up a note. 

“Jesus, take it, mister. I don’ 
want it, I can’t stand it. That’s 
why I sended the big ones to a 
name I seen in a directory book. 
The feller at Thlex, my friend, he 
said I could get money. I filled out 
some papers, he showed me how, 
except he was so high, I don’t 
guess we did a very good job. 
Guess I got a bank somewhere. 
Don’t know where, though. 
Money. I guess so, too. Except the 
feller unnerstood and swum all 
the way to Ohio and got killed 
hunting a new fix. He couldn’t 
stand it either.” 

A LL at once Caul’s mind ran 
down like a broken clock. 
He stood, just stood. His arms 
dangled. His lower lip made a pla- 
teau from which saliva dripped, 
evil and iridescent under the 
weird mountain moon. 

“I see,” Rhinelander choked, 
talking half to himself. “The 
burns — the incomplete treatment 
— you look inside heads — ” 

A stupid, pleading smile 
twitched Caul’s lips. 

“You unnerstand. You a 
friend?” 

“No, I’m not your friend. Christ, 
no!” 

“I can’t he’p what I see,” Caul 
mumbled. “I see it, I got to purge

it out or I’d kill myself.” Caul 
looked down at his most recent 
work. “Thankee. I wanted to 
paint again because some of what 
I seen was still inside my head, 
but — I guess — it takes a dirty 
head to get it really stirred again. 
Wasn’t bad enough until you 
come. Just bad, not bad enough.” 

“A dirty head,” Rhinelander 
said, with a witless giggle. He 
could hardly speak. “You — that’s 
why — the Picturs — they look so 
familiar, but — dirty heads. 
They’re— all of us?” 

“Please,” said Caul, holding up 
the painting. 

“Give me that thing,” Rhine- 
lander screamed. He snatched the 
canvas from Caul’s hands, scrab- 
bled on the stone floor, opened 
the razor and began to slash, criss- 
cross, with great outraged strokes. 

Slash, slash, slash. Anything to 
eradicate the putrescent vision of 
his own mind which Joe Caul had 
somehow seen tonight, seen and 
sucked out and transferred to vir- 
ulent, shadowy life on his little 
scrap of canvas. Slash, slash, slash. 
Rhinelander struck back and 
forth like a demon. 

“What you doin’, mister?” Caul 
caught Rhinelander by the shoul- 
der with one loose hand. “Hey, 
there! What — ” 

Unable to control himself, 
Rhinelander spun around. His 
arm whipped back and forth in a 
continuation of the hysterical at- 



tack upon the canvas. The razor 
gleamed cold as death and sliced 
clean through Joe Caul’s jugular. 

Caul screamed. He lurched into 
a corner of the cell, kneeling in 
his own bubbling blood. Some- 
thing blue-white exploded from 
the corridor. Rhinelander grew 
conscious of a babble of voices he 
had heard for some time. Then a 
louder voice exclaimed: 

“A wright, awright, how was I to 
know he’d kill him? I got the shot, 
you can go in now an’ — quit shov- 
ing, dammit! I’m a representative 
of the press.” 

Rhinelander staggered to an- 
other corner, unable to look at 
the twitching, bleeding thing he 
had killed. Through his blurred 
eyesight swam the face of Brother 
Buzz. Then another face with a 
red fan beard. Monks were tussl- 
ing with the intruder, who had a 
camera and was shouting about 
being manhandled: 

“Sigma. Charley Sigma, Top- 
flite Press Service. Legit? Sure 
I’m legit! Been following this bird 
for days. Mystery of Joe Caul. 
Got a tip in Geneva about a 
cracked numbered account. What 
a story. ‘The cesspool of the hu- 
man mind on canvas.’ Awright, 
awright, quit shoving. I know my 
constitutional rights. Where’s the 
communication center in this 
dump?” 

Mine, Rhinelander thought 
hideously. He had slashed the 



188 



GALAXY 



canvas but could not slash its 
image out of his thoughts. Purple, 
whirling, obscene. Mine! 

“A little tranquility, brothers,” 
said the voice of Brother Buzz 
with conference-room authority. 
Rhinelander felt the blessed 
needle pierce his arm to bring the 
blessed dark. 

VI 

TJHINELANDER or Iris or 
Watty seldom went to the 
observatory in the villa because 
none of them were interested in 
astronomy. But the observatory 
sat upon the highest point of their 
property, overlooking a distant 
highway, so tonight the three of 
them stood by the balustrade, 
watching. Far off, lights by the 
thousands burned in a crawling 
pattern along the highway. Rhine- 
lander turned his back, feeling 
chilly, although the evening tem- 
perature was over seventy. 

He didn’t care to watch. Iris 
had insisted, however, The 
psychomentalist who cleared 
Rhinelander of accidental homo- 
slaughter at his hearing had also 
insisted. 

Watty, never at a loss, 
chuckled. 

“Did you see the sheets to- 
night, Nels old boy? Five hun- 
dred thousand copies of Professor 
Hatlo’s new edition of A Bioglos- 
sary of Great Artists destroyed at 



the end of the press run? Poor 
Hatlo only finished revising it 
three weeks ago to include Joe 
Caul. And the reviews! What an 
about-face.” 

“Vile,” Iris breathed. “Those — 
pictures.” Her sticky lips twisted 
with loathing. “They couldn’t 
come from any one of us.” 

“Oh, no?” Watty laughed again. 
He lifted his hand to indicate the 
moving chain of lights. “My dear, 
they’re from all of us. Or were.” 

“When is Swallows’s funeral?” 
Rhinelander asked. Swallows had 
hung himselff 

“Tomorrow,” said Watty. 

“What fools we were,” Rhine- 
lander said with another long 
shudder. 

“Amen,” Iris said. “For once we 
agree, darling.” 

“Oh, no,” said Watty. “A week 
ago we weren’t fools. We were 
sensitive men and women. To- 
night we’ve become fools again. 
Incidentally, Nels. Although you 
did find your friend Caul, I still 
consider that you failed to win 
our little challenge. Nels? Ah, 
well.” 

Rhinelander stood rigid, smil- 
ing a little now. The procession 
of lights had come to a halt. A red 
smear leaked up on the horizon. 

It grew redder and taller. Soon 
it revealed the fifty thousand who 
had marched out of the city to 
burn the five Picturs of Joe Caul.

r | ''HIS PAST autumn, the New 
York Times published a fine 
article by Isaac Asimov recapitu- 
lating the role of science fiction of 
the recent past in the develop- 
ment of our present technology. 
The question that Asimov raised 
was, with so many of its basic 
plot concepts translated into 
reality, where does SF go from 
here? To an aficianado, the 
answer is obvious. The sky is not 
the limit. The tremendous break- 
throughs in all branches of inves- 
tigation are opening up fictional 
vistas that are positively stagger- 
ing in their potential. The impact 



of all these innovations on social, 
political and economic levels 
presents a huge challenge to the 
author brave enough to attempt 
a picture of future life in a world 
formed in the mold of new scien- 
tific achievement. 

Of course, to us this is noth- 
ing new. Such trailblazers as 
Asimov’s own Caves of Steel, 
Pohl-Kornbluth’s Gravy Planet, 
Bester’s Demolished Man set a 
pattern for exploring fantastic 
environments from the viewpoint 
of day-to-day living. 

However, another interesting 
point raised by Asimov: 



190 



GALAXY 



Just as we watched the science 
fiction stories of our fathers be- 
come matter-of-fact, so we can 
see our own favorite SF themes 
graduate into the realm of every- 
day reality. The rocket is fast 
following the path of the flying 
machine, the horseless carriage 
and the submersible boat. The 
sober space timetable issued by 
NASA reads like a plot back- 
ground of recent super-imagina- 
tive fiction: two-man orbital 

flight, three-man flight, space- 
ship construction in earth orbit, 
orbital moon flight, moon land- 
ings. And all this projected only 
slightly more than a half decade 
into the future! 

Living proof of this is a new 
series of boys’ books by Donald 
A. Wollheim. 

Just a short span of years ago, 
the words “American Rocket So- 
ciety” conjured up a picture in 
the public eye of a group of wild- 
eyed, half loony visionaries, com- 
pletely out of touch with reality, 
living in a dream world of their 
own. Now along comes this series, 
replete with ideas, concepts and 
themes which were utterly laugh- 
able then to Mr. Averageman and 
they read like, not today’s, but 
yesterday’s newspaper. Sic transit 
yesterday’s science fiction. Mike 
Mars has already receded from 
the future to the past, alongside 
Tom Swift, The Rover Boys and 
the long list of Verne heroes. 



MIKE MARS, ASTRONAUT; 
MIKE MARS FLIES THE X-15; 
MIKE MARS AT CAPE CANAV- 
ERAL; MIKE MARS IN ORBIT, 
all by Donald A. Wollheim, 
Doubleday & Co. Inc. 

THESE BOOKS, which would 
have qualified as adult SF fare 
in subject matter if not in treat- 
ment five years ago, are carefully 
geared to reality. 

Wollheim’s intensive research 
has lent an air of authenticity to 
the stories that should impart 
considerable knowledge to young, 
would-be astronauts — of both 
sexes. 

One beneficial result of the 
Russian lead in the space-race 
has been the elimination of the 
swarthy, bearded foreigner as the 
engineer of plot conflict. Woll- 
heim has substituted a money- 
and power-hungry father and 
publicity-hungry son as the vil- 
lainous team. Not much more 
edible, perhaps, but slightly more 
credible. 

The individual titles are indi- 
cative of content and each vol- 
ume is complete, although there 
is a crude tie-in at the end of 
each.

THRESHOLD OF THE STARS 
by Paul Berna. Abelard-Schu- 
man. 

BERNA’S JUVENILE envis- 
ioned the French as winners of 
the space contest. He thus joins 
the ranks of a host of other foggy 
crystal ball owners. 

The story action is viewed 
through the eyes of a twelve-year- 
old, son of a remote-control ex- 
pert, cloistered along with a 
thousand others in a secret base. 
Security is strict but youngsters 
bent on exploration can slip 
mouselike through the tightest 
checkpoints. 

Berna’s concept of a burgeon- 
ing space project is, to say the 
least, naive, as are his estimates 
of costs. But this is easily for- 
given. Eight years of hindsight 
can make an Einstein of anyone. 

The story, outdated though it 
is, is written with Gallic verve 
and sparkles with a spirit of ad- 
venture and wonder. Young 
readers will find the outlook of 
the French adult a refreshing 
contrast to that of the usual 
American. 

Rating:**** 

Then there is the ageless story, 
in which the author places the 
action so far in the future that 
there is little danger of scientific 
developments catching up with 
the yarn for quite some time. 



SPACEMEN, GO HOME by Mil- 
ton Lesser. Holt, Rinehart and 
Winston. 

LESSER’S latest juvenile is in 
this category. And even though 
there is a continuing revolution 
in computer design and tech- 
niques, there is likewise little dan- 
ger of any foreseeable parallel of 
Lesser’s basic gimmick', a planet- 
size, self-operative computer of 
advanced design. 

A joint project of a Galactic 
confederation similar to the UN, 
the Star Brain was built to settle 
all disputes between worlds. To 
supply the background for the 
story, it has ruled against Earth 
in a dispute with an alien race. 
Without going into story detail, 
suffice it to report that it is a 
study of the contrast between the 
good and the bad inherent in 
human conduct and how such a 
contrast might baffle alien in- 
telligences.

Books for youngsters are 
among the best gauges of techno- 
logical advancement. Dikty’s col- 
lection, believe it or not, contains 
not a single story that was written 
for a juvenile audience. All, with- 
out exception, were written with 
the highly informed adult reader 
in mind. 

Such is the pace of our scien- 
tific progress.

EVERY BOY’S BOOK OF 
OUTER SPACE STORIES ed- 
ited by T. E. Dikty. Frederick 
Fell, Inc. 

DIKTY’S ANTHOLOGY is an 
odd assemblage of real McCoy 
and real McCorn. Of course, back 
in the ’30s, such as Manly Wade 
Wellman’s Men Against the Stars 
read like pure heart rather than 
99.44% hokum. However, most 
of the others are excellent. 

Kornbluth’s That Share of 
Glory, Correy’s . And a Star 
to Steer Her By, Abernathy’s 
startling concept of The Canal 
Builders and Jameson’s Blind 
Man’s Buff are all typical of the 
unlimited horizon of SF. 

Rating: **** 

Asimov himself is a master of 
the timeless story. Of his dozen 
or so novels, none is in any dan- 
ger of immediate obsolescence. 
He is his own best example of 
what an unfettered imagination 
can create from trends or devel- 
opments that are barely emerg- 
ing in our own time. None of his 
novels is more recent than half 
a decade past, yet each is a 
fresh-cut gem.

A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF 
THE SEA by Willard Bascom. 
Doubleday & Co., Inc. 

THE ABOVE BOOK serves as 
an admirable example of fact en- 
croaching on fiction in our spe- 
cialized field. I’d be a wealthy 
man if I had a dollar for every 
fictional hole in the Earth’s crust, 
from Verne’s and Burroughs’s to 
the shiveringly ingenious one be- 
ing drilled from below by Arthur 
C. Clarke. But, frankly, I don’t 
recall any fictional excavations 
of real depth beneath the ocean 
floor. Quite a few books, from 
Coblentz’s Sunken World to the 
Pohl-Williamson juvenile sub- 
aquatic series, have envisioned 
limited penetration of the under- 
sea crust but all have fallen short 
of the audacity of planning ex-

a midocean hole some 25,000 feet 
down through solid rock to reach 
earth’s mantle. 

Won’t opening such a hole 
create a volcano or cause earth- 
quakes? 

Of course not, the author says, 
and proves his point. He also 
elaborates on drilling techniques 
on land and water and offers such- 
a plethora of fascinating geologi- 
cal information that even a casual 
reader will soon find himself com- 
pletely absorbed in an enthralling 
book. 

This is author Bascom’s own 
do-it-yourself, since he is also Di- 
rector of the Mohole Project. He 
has managed to pour his own 
knowledge and enthusiasm in 
such great measure into his book 
that it qualifies unqualifiedly as 
un-down-puttable. 

THE BEST FROM FANTASY 
AND SCIENCE FICTION, 
TENTH SERIES, edited by 
Robert P. Mills. Doubleday & 
Co., Inc. 

EDITOR MILLS has turned out 
a collection from last year’s crop 
of F&SF yarns that is as well 
balanced as a circus aerialist. Al- 
most all of the seventeen items 
are topnotch, with the following 
as tip toppers: Robert F. Young’s 
Nikita Eisenhower Jones, a star- 
struck Polynesian; Richard Mc- 
Kenna’s Mine Own Ways, super- 



civilization’s field anthropologists 
survive or die in primitive man- 
hood rituals: The Rainbow Gold, 
Jane Rice’s superbly comic back- 
woods pot-o’-gold story and Ward 
Moore’s The Fellow Who Mar- 
ried the Max ill Girl, a sensitive 
account of the plight of a dim- 
witted (by his race’s standards) 
alien, his green thumb and his 
exile on Earth.

THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT 
by Harry Harrison. Pyramid 
Books. 

HARRISON’S SLICK story, as 
highly polished as his striking 
title, envisions a society in which 
crime literally does not pay. Only 
the lone-wolf super-criminal can 
buck the superbly equipped and 
organized law-enforcement agen- 
cies with success. And thereby 
hangs his tale: set a thief to catch 
a thief. The top-secret Special 
Corps does just that, since the 
devious workings of the criminal 
mind differ from that of the con- 
scientious cop. 

Harrison’s clever yarn explores 
a fascinating facet of the future, 
crime detection and prevention, 
and though pure entertainment, 
underlines SF’s role in providing 
speculative thought about poten- 
tial problems.
