STRATEGY & TACTICS Is a magazine. It's 
also a tool: a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events — past, present, 
and future — that shape our lives. 

Now. instead of merely reading about what's 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique of Conflict Simulation. 



What ia Conflict Simulation? 

Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game") format, the conflict situation is 
re-created -so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and, in the game at 
least, change the way things were, are, or

CRY • ? ' 



Rrjdt-fs wri[t.‘ <im! wrotur 



Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I have several things to comment on 
regarding the April ’ 73 Worlds of If. 
I have never really enjoyed del Rey as 
a reviewer until this issue, but this 
was a review from which much can be 
learned. Most reviewers seldom 
come down hard on even a bad book, 
but Mr. del Rey did a fine job on Clon- 
ing. I like reviewers who demand a 
lot and let readers know when a book 
may not be up to par. 

Vll be paying closer, attention to this 
column from now on. 

I am about to add Colin Kapp to my 
small but growing list of authors who 
cause me to sit up all night reading. So 
far only Delany and Ursula K. LeGuin 
have managed the feat. Now Mr. 
Kapp has joined them. / cant remem- 
ber a serial that has had me more 
eagerly waiting for : the next install- 
ment than his last one in If. The con- 
clusion of The Wizard of Anharitte 
was the first thing I read in the April is- 
sue and it was good to the end — one of 
the most entertaining, enjoyable 
and best thought-out books I’ve had 
the pleasure to read in a long time. 

Another thing I’d like to bring up 
deals with the suddenly (to me) 
asinine efforts (including my own) at 
defining science fiction. We are 
madly trying to name the thing, draw 
its limits , say where it stops , where it 
starts and how far it can go. This is a 



little like saying that the universe is 
infinitf, but ends four hundred miles 
beyond Pluto. Nuts. I think most peo- 
ple at least sense that science fiction is 
a literature without limits, so what 
the hell are we trying to limit it for? 
My feeling is that the so-called “ hard- 
core ” advocates are way off base. The 
argument is silly — science fiction is 
that form of literature that cant be de- 
fined. 

So why don’t we just get down to 
reaching out farther with our imag- 
inations — that’s what the field needs. 

One last item: Does anyone know if 
there is a science fiction club in Van- 
couver? I’ve just moved here from the 
east and have been unable to find out. 
Nicholas Grimshawe 
Vancouver, B. C. 

Will those in the know please reply 
in care of Hue and Cry? Mr. Grim- 
shawe, an old and valued contributor 
to this department, neglected to en- 
close his latest address. Contribu- 
tors’ complete addresses are pub- 
lished only upon request — in this case 
to do so might have been in order. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

It seems that / have entered my sub- 
scriptions at an odd date— just when 
the last Jack Gaughan art died away 
from the covers of If and Galaxy. Will 
the old fellow ever be coming back? 
Oh, sure — I see plenty of his sketches 
inside, but none outside. 

Cover by Brian Boyle, says an in- 
side page. I sigh in passive sad- 
ness — no Gaughan. Ever since his 
weirdo covers for the lensman series 
I’ve been following his artwork all 
across the world of sf books and mag -

NOVELETTE 



I 

THHE door was locked, so Pear- 
sail rang the door chime — who 
carries a housekey halfway down 
the galaxy’s arm and back, eight 
months by Skip Drive? It was long 
enough, he saw, for the white paint 
to have begun flaking off the door. 
Pearsall had applied that paint 
slowly and lovingly only a few 
weeks before Hawk Flight's depar- 
ture. The industrial fumes evi- 
dently had been getting worse. 

His wife opened the door. 
“Who — Woody!” She flung herself 
at him, arms reaching and clasp- 
ing — but only for a moment. Sud- 
denly she recoiled and staggered 
back, her face contorted. 

“No!” She backed away through 
the foyer toward the living room, 



7 



hands clenching and unclenching, 
gray eyes wide and mouth slack 
with shock. 

He followed, but didn’t try to 
touch her. “What’s the matter, 
Glenna?” Something was happen- 
ing too fast — he couldn’t believe 
her reaction, let alone understand 
it. “You heard the ship was in, 
didn’t you?’’ Her face was pale, the 
fine cheekbones standing out from 
the faint hollows Tjelow. She shook 
her head. Her mouth worked but 
no words came out. _ 

“You’ve cut your hair,’’ he said. 
She had always worn it long and 
straight. Now it was a mass of 
short curls, tinted a lighter red- 
brown than he remembered. One 
curl hung loose over her right eye- 
brow, near the tiny black mole at 
the corner of her eye. Almost as 
tall as he, still slim, she stood rig- 
idly defensive, angles of bone ac- 
centing her loose beige robe. 

“Who are you? What do you 
want?’’ 

It didn’t make sense. He tried to 
smile but the smile died — he sup- 
pressed an impulse to reach out to 
her. “Well, who do I look like?’’ 
His tone was gentle. “Have I 
changed so much in only eight 
months?” 

Her fisted hands stood out * 
little from her sides, shaking. 
“Whoever you are, it isn’t funny! 
It’s a cruel, cruel joke!” Now he 

8 



felt the edge of panic — sweat 
prickled at his armpits. 

She turned arid ran to the bed- 
room, paused just inside the door- 
way. “Get out! You get out of 
here! I have a gun. My — my hus- 
band’s. So you just better get out of 
here!” She disappeared behind the 
door — he heard her rummaging 
through drawers. 

To Pearsall, his mind stalled at 
dead center, the chime of the pic- 
turephone came almost as a rblief. 
Automatically he set his bag on the 
floor and crossed the room to flip 
the switch, the thought came that 
he’d never heard of anyone being 
shot while answering the phone and 
he almost grinned. But not 
quite— a bullet was not what he 
feared. 

The chubby-faced man on the 
screen was familiar by sight but not 
by name — a junior member of the 
spaceport commander’s staff. 

“Yes,” the man said, “we 
thought you might be there.” He 
waved Pearsall to silence. “We’ve 
pinpointed the discrepancy noted in 
the records when Hawk Flight 
landed. Admiral Forgues wants to 
discuss that with you. Meanwhile, 
a John Laifd urgently requests that 
you call him at his home. One of 
your navigation personnel, I be- 
lieve. The young man seemed al- 
most hysterical.” 

Forgues, the port commander,* 

IF 




moved into the picture. “I’ll take 
it — I’ll take it — ” Peripherally, 
Pearsall saw Glenna in the bed- 
room doorway. She had found the 
.old automatic pistol but the gun 
pointed at the floor as she watched 
Pearsall and the screen. 

“All right,” said Forgues, “let’s 
get to the bottom of this. Who are 
you?” 

Exasperation drove out fear. 
Pearsall exhaled hard. “Sir, I am 
Commander Elwood Jay Pearsall, 
first officer on Hawk Flight. 
You’ve known me for fifteen years 
at least. Is my identity in doubt?” 
“It certainly is. Whoever you are 
you’re not Woody Pearsall — and 
what you were doing on Hawk 
Flight , I don’t know. But I intend 
to find out. So you might as well 
tell the truth. Now.” 

“Damn it, sir, I’m Woody Pear- 
sall.” He shook his head briskly to 
clear it of cobwebs. “Who the hell 
else would I be?” 

Forgues grinned tightly. “Well, 
in that case we do have a problem. 
Because, you see, you're dead.” 

T HE viewscreen, as Pearsall 
maneuvered Hawk Flight to its 
final descent, was spattered with 
random moving dots. He jiggled a 
tuning knob slightly, but saw no 
improvement. The knob was 
sticky. He made a mental note to 
tell young Laird that if he abso- 



lutely had to eat on watch, for 
God’s sake to wipe his hands be- 
fore touching the equipment. 

The landing area showed clearly 
enough, but the flashing dots were 
a distraction. The viewing equip- 
ment was due for a full over- 
haul— but then, so was the entire 
ship. And so was Pearsall. 

The spaceport looked unfamil- 
iar, somehow. To hisj*ight, toward 
the nearby city, he remembered a 
soaring tower topping a white, 
shining building. Surely it couldn’t 
have been torn down in the .eight 
months he’d been away — the build- 
ing had been almost new. Perhaps 
he was confusing one spaceport 
with another — perhaps an overdose 
of Skip Drive was fogging his 
memory. He put full attention to 
landing the ship. The impact was 
barely noticeable. 

“Nice grounding. Woody.” The 
voice over the intercom was Cap- 
tain Vaille’s. “Give the watch to 
Laird and report to my quarters, 
would you, please?” 

Pearsall acknowledged. 

“All your^,” he said to John 
Laird. “See you next, on the 
ground, probably. The main- 
tenance crew will be here to relieve 
you as soon as our landing blast 
cools. When they arrive call the 
captain’s quarters for clearance 
and you’re home free.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Laird. “Now re-

member, Commander, I want you 
and your wife to meet my family, 
have dinner with us, as soon as you 
can. You have the address?” 

“Right.” He tipped Laird a 
mock-salute and left. 

The captain’s quarters were one 
deck below. Halfway down the nar- 
row ladder Pearsall’s heel caught 
on a torn edge of plastic. He almost 
fell, but caught himself. “Damned 
old crock really needs some work,” 
he grumbled. But he patted the 
bulkhead beside him to soften the 
curse before proceeding to the cap- 
tain’s cabin. 

Vaille was big, taller and heavier 
than Pearsall. On his desk were a 
bottle and two small glasses. 

“A toast. Woody? It’s been a 
hard trip, but a good one.” They 
raised their glasses, sipped. The li- 
quor was an oTf-world product, a 
brandy from Harper’s Touchdown. 
Golden flecks hung in the dark 
fluid. 

“You’re right, skipper — a good, 
hard trip.” Eight months on high 
Skip-factor, never landing, only 
slowing a few times for fly-by re- 
connaissance of new planetary sys- 
tems, took a lot out of men and 
ship alike. But the odds had been 
good to them — Hawk Flight's un- 
manned one-way probes had dis- 
covered two new habitable planets, 
potential colony sites. 

“We should be able to dis- 



embark in an hour or two,” said 
Vaille. “All the tapes and solar- 
wind samples are boxed to go. I 
imagine everyone^ has his own stuff 
packed, or nearly. I can throw my 
gear together in five minutes.” 
Pearsall grinned. “Me, too. Or 
leave it — and good riddance.” 
Vaille laughed with him. It was 
good to be home. Even the nor- 
mally reticent captain was affected. 

In due time the maintenance- 
and-repair crew boarded. Its chief 
brought clearance papers, thus ac- 
cepting responsibility^ for the 
ship — red tape was minimal. 
Spaceport personnel began the un- 
loading of cargo. And finally 
Hawk Flight's crew, fifteen men 
and nine women, trod the catwalk 
to the outside gantry, rode the ele- 
vator down and touched shoe soles 
to Earth’s concrete rind. As al- 
ways, that moment gripped Pear- 
sall’s throat. 

P ORT Commander Forgues no 
longer greeted returning crews 
personally. Many ships came and 
went now and Forgues had other 
duties — procedures had been 
streamlined. Even the newspersons 
stayed away; making do with offi- 
cial handouts unless a real news 
-item were involved. Announcement 
of the two new colony planets, 
Pearsall guessed, would soon bring 
them running.

IF 




He didn’t recognize the subordi- 
nate who was preparing to do the 
honors. The man struck him as a 
bit of a fussbudget, with his clip- 
board in one hand and pencil 
shifted awkwardly back and forth 
between handshakes. 

“Captain Vaille? Yes.” Check- 
mark, shift pencil, handshake. 
“Welcome. Honored, sir.” End of 
handshake. Shift pencil. “First Of- 
ficer Frantiszek?” Checkmark. 
Shift pencil. 

“No. I’m First Officer Pear- 
sall.” No handshake. The pencil 
wavered. 

“Pearsall? Must be a mixup. 
Where’s Frantiszek?” 

Pearsall looked for Vaille to an- 
swer, but the captain was talking 
with someone else, a few feet away. 
“I replaced Frantiszek when he 
broke his leg skiing, a week before 
we left. Funny you didn’t get the 
correction.” The mishap had 
boosted Pearsall to First Officer a 
year or two before he had expected 
the promotion. 

Erase checkmark, scribble note. 
“All right — we’ll check it out,” the 
man said and moved along to the 
next person. No handshake for 
Pearsall. Bored, he withdrew his 
attention while the man check- 
marked and handshook his way 
down the list. 

A tone of exclamation broke his 
reverie. “Laird? My roster shows

no John Laird. What is your posi- 
tion on this ship?” 

“Junior navigator, sir,” the boy 
answered. “On commander Pear- 
sall’s watch.” 

“Pearsall, eh? Neither of you is 
on my roster.” He harumphed. 
“We’ll check it out.” No hand- 
shake for Laird either. 

They were escorted to a nearby 
building for a quick, perfunctory 
medical check. Orin Teague, Hawk 
Flight's own medical officer, had 
made thorough examinations and 
certified the ship’s complement as 
free of alien infection, but the min- 
imum formality was still observed. 

Then they were free, the two 
dozen, to go where they would and 
do what they could. “Report back 
Tuesday morning,” said the man 
with the discrepant list. “Oh-eight 
hundred sharp. That gives you sev- 
enty-two hours, less a few.” By 
Tuesday, Pearsall thought, their re- 
ports would be analyzed — the re- 
ports they had prepared during the 
past in-flight months. Until then 
Hawk Flight's crew was super- 
fluous. That suited him just fine. 

He shook all the hands he could 
find, waved goodbyes and left to 
catch a city-bound tube train. On 
arrival he used his spaceman’s pri- 
ority card to rent a ground car. He 
checked its fuel-cell reading and set 
off for Fisher’s Landing, the small 
neighboring town that was home. 



He didn’t call first — it had never 
been his habit. 

During his absence some street 
routings had been changed. He 
found his usual access to the 
throughway was one-way in the 
wrong direction. Rather than tak- 
ing time to solve the new layout, he 
settled for an older, secondary arte- 
rial and soon made his way out of 
the city into a countryside of roll- 
ing hills. 

It was that time! of autumn when 
leaves turn color but have yet to 
fall. One small maple, yellow and 
fed, so entranced him that he 
pulled over and stopped— just to 
look, to make it part of him. 

He left before he was done with 
his tree, because now he was so 
near that he could no longer wait to 
see Glenna. Married to him for al- 
most twenty-five years, more than 
half his life— she still brought all 
his senses alive. 

Either the signs had been 
changed or he had day- 
dreamed— he missed his turn-off. 
But he circled, found an unfamiliar 
road with the proper designation. 
Soon he was back on his homeward 
route and enterings Fisher’s Land- 
ing. Until he turned into his own 
street he didn’t realize he had been 
driving faster than usual. 

He parked in front and paused a 
moment to look at the house, sa- 
voring the weathered wood. Ivy

was growing to cover the bay win- 
dow again — it needed cutting back. 
A brick, maybe more than one, 
was missing from the chimney top 
— he tried to remember if he’d seen 
it before. He couldn’t be sure. No 
matter — he’d have to fix it anyway. 

He got out of the car and locked 
it, taking only his bag, leaving his 
other luggage for later. He strode 
up the flagstone walk, finally giv- 
ing impatience its head. 

By habit he reached into his 
pocket for the house key. Then he 
laughed and rang the door chime. 

^fT\EAD, sir?” Pearsall stared 
^^at Forgues' blue-tinted 
image and shook his head. “One 
of us has to be crazy." 

“That’s possible,” said the admi- 
ral. “Why else would you pretend 
to be a man who was killed more 
than a year ago? Tube train fail- 
ure — you must have seen it in the 
news. The propelling field col- 
lapsed. Cars smashed out through 
the girders. At least seventy dead.” 
“Not me, though.” Now he re- 
membered the disaster. “I missed 
that train.” 

“Obviously,” said Forgues, “but 
Pearsall didn’t. You look like 
hinr — or like his twin if he had 
one — but you can’t be Woody. I at- 
tended the funeral myself, damn it! 
So who are you?” 

To Pearsall none of it made 



sense — but somewhere there had to 
be a handle, a place to apply logic 
and twist hard. 

“Ask the captain,” he said. 
“Captain Vaille — he can vouch for 
me. 

Forgues shook his head. “Can’t 
locate him. He and his wife went 
off somewhere, left no word.” 

“But any of the other offi- 
cers — or the crew?” The admiral’s 
head still moved side-to-side, his 
face stony in negation. “Or 
even — the fussy fellow with the 
clipboard. He saw me come off the 
ship—” 

‘ “But he didn’t see you get on. Or 
where you got on.” Abruptly For- 
gues’ face went stiff, his eyes wide. 

At first Pearsall didn’t get 
it— and then he did. He laughed.- 
“ Hawk Flight made no outworld 
landings. Admiral. We didn’t even 
have occasion to use the airlocks. 
Run the telemetry tapes through 
your computers.” Faced with ques- 
tions that had answers he felt his 
mind coming alive, working surely. 

The admiral’s grin was sheepish. 
“All right, that’s easy enough to 
check. We can scratch the sugges- 
tion that you’re some kind of alien. 
But that doesn’t tell me who you 
are. So you tell me.” 

Pearsall shook his head. “I’ve 
done that. Sir, with all due respect, 
we’re wasting time. There’s a mis- 
take somewhere — I don’t know

what it is. I’ll report Tuesday as or- 
dered. Meanwhile I have a couple 
of personal problems to attend 
to — urgent ones/’ He hit the cutoff 
switch before the admiral could 
reply. He daught himself worrying 
with a fingertip the spot at the 
crown of the head where his hair 
was thinning and took his hand 
away. 

And what of Glenna? He turned 
and saw her standing near the bed- 
room doorway, the old handgun 
hanging loose in her hand. She 
stared at him, but now in puz- 
zlement rather than outrage. 

“Well, Glenna? Am I me — the 
man you married?” 

“You can’t be.” He could barely 
hear her words. “Woody is 
dead— I saw him buried.” She 
winced. “Oh, you look like him, 
talk and act like him — but you 
can’t be him.” The gun dropped 
to the carpet. “I wish to God you 
could. But you can’t.” She put her 
hands to her face — leaning back 
against the wall she slowly sank to 
the floor and sat there, sobbing. 

Knowing he must not touch her, 
Pearsall moved to squat facing her, 
not close enough to threaten. Qui- 
etly he spoke. 

“Glenna — Glenna.’’ Again: 
“Glenna.” Repeating her name 
slowly until she raised her head and 
looked at him. 

“I am Woody,’’ he said, 



“Woody Pearsall. I look and talk 
and -act like him— and love like 
him — because I am him. I’m me, 
Glenna, nobody else. A long time 
ago we married each other — 
remember?” Blankfaced, her head 
shook slowly. 

“The tube train didn’t kill me 
that night because I missed it. I 
was late for dinner. You were 
really angry when I finally got 
home — until we saw the news of 
the wreck. I’ve been gone eight 
months on Hawk Flight . Before I 
left you and I had a champagne 
dinner — more champagne than 
dinner, I’m afraid. Then we took a 
boat out near the middle of Lake 
Fisher and made love there. Don’t 
you remember?” 

“I’d like to. Oh, I’d like to!” 
Then her voice went dull. “But I 
can’t — because it didn’t happen.” 

“To me it did. And you were 
there. You were all of it. Try to 
remember.” 

“I’d like to,” she said again. 
“But I saw my husband dead.” 
Facing him, she was like a blank 
wall. 

“I’m dead and I’m not dead.” 
He spoke more toiiimself than to 
her. “We made love on the lake^ 
and we didn’t. I was v on the ship but 
I wasn’t. The admiral helped bury 
me — but I’m not buried. 
Glenna — ” His tone snapped her 
alert. “I don’t know what’s wrong,

but if there’s any way I can do so 
I’ll find out.” He sighed and 
touched her hair gingerly, as 
though it might electrocute him. 
“I have to leave now for a while. 
But try to know who I am. Will 
you?” 

She managed no words, but nod- 
ded, then fled, crying. 

J OHN LAIRD’S line was busy. 

Pearsall calculated — it was less 
than an hour’s drive — best to go 
now, without calling ahead. And 
better, he thought, not to stay in 
one place too long — Forgues might 
decide to have him pulled in rather 
than wait until Tuesday. The front- 
door key was on its usual hook in 



the kitchen. He took it. 

Dusk had come, the time of 
beauty that is dangerous to drivers. 
Pearsall drove fast but with full 
concentration and alert- 
ness— officially he might be dead 
but factually he was alive' and de- 
termined to remain so. 

He passed an apartment high- 
rise — it loomed gray, square and 
ugly, but the massed upper win- 
dows reflected the last of the day’s 
sun as molten copper. The glow fit 
his mood. He watched until it 
passed to the side of his vision. 

The Laird home was hidden in a 
semi-suburban housing cluster, a 
puzzle-piece of contrived curving 
streets that changed names at every

jogging. By backtracking and per- 
sistence Pearsall found the address 
he sought. 

In the dim light the house both 
sprawled and soared. Its style of 
architecture had bloomed rapidly 
and dated almost as fast. He 
parked in the double-width drive- 
way and approached the huge, oval 
front door. Finding no pushbutton, 
he knocked. 

An older, heavier version of 
John Laird opened the door. “All 
right, what do you want?” The man 
sounded as harassed as he looked, 
with his rumpled hair, high color 
and heavy breathing. 

‘Tm looking for John Laird.” 

“You found him. What do you 
want with me?” 

“The John Laird I know is 
younger. Your son, perhaps?” 

“No — Christ, no! But maybe 
you’d better come in, at that. You 
might be able to help.” 

“Help? How?” But Pearsall 
thought he knew. 

“A young man came here. He 
says he’s my son, claims to be 
named John Laird. I came home 
this afternoon — my wife was half- 
crazy. This boy we never saw was 
calling her ‘mother’— and then me, 
‘father.’ And damn it, we never saw 
him before — ” 

“How do you figure I can help?” 

“Sounded as if you said you 
knew him. If you do, maybe you 



can get some sense out of him. He 
locked himself in the bathroom and 
won’t come out. Come on — I’ll 
show you the way.” 

Pearsall was led into a large liv- 
ing room, past a plump, wide-eyed 
woman* a boy about twenty and 
two teenaged girls — he was in- 
troduced to none of them — along a 
•hall, to a door. Closed, it 
was — closed, and inscrutable. 

Laird nodded. “He’s in there.” 
“All right.” He raised his voice. 
“John Laird. This is Pearsall.” 

II 

44/^OMMANDER.” The voice 
^-'was muffled. “Thank God 
you’re here — someone who knows 
I’m real. I thought I was going 
crazy. Or that everybody else was.” 
“I — think I know how you feel, 
John.” Pearsall grinned briefly, a 
ticlike twitch. “Why don’t you 
come out now and talk it over? 
Let’s see if any of this makes sense. 
All right?” 

“You won’t let them send me 
away?” 

Pearsall thought — he couldn’t 
speak for the Laird- family. “If you 
can’t stay here, John, you can come 
with me. Will that do?” 

“I guess so.” The" door opened. 
Young John Laird, looking both 
sheepish and defiant, emerged. 
Pearsall shepherded the two Lairds 



16 



IF 




to the living room, where the others 
sat stiffly, as though posing for an 
old tintype. 

“I’m Commander Pearsall,” he 
said, “First officer of the ship Hawk 
Flight. As you may have heard, 
we’ve just returned from an eight- 
month mission.” He turned to the 
older man. “Would you introduce 
me?” 

“All right, Commander. You 
know my name. This is my wife, 
Bonita — my son Charles — my 
daughters Mildred — ” he nodded 
at the older girl “ — and Irene.” 

Pearsall smiled and performed 
the ritual courtesies. “And now,” 
he ^aid, “may I introduce this 
young man, who for the past eight 
months has served as my junior na- 
vigator? He is listed on the ship’s 
roster as John Laird, Jr. — of this 
address.” 

“I can’t believe that,” Mr. Laird 
said. 

“The roster isn’t classified — I 
can get you a photostat if you 
like.” Impatiently Pearsall shook 
his head. “But right now — Laird, 
men on watch together pass the 
time by talking and they talk of 
home. Young John here has spoken 
often of you. He has described this 
house to me and many pleasant 
recollections of it. __ 

“Tell me,” he said, “do none of 
you recognize him at all?” He saw 
only blank stares. “Are you saying 



that it’s some kind of delusion that 
he believes himself to be your son 
and brother?” 

Bonita Laird spoke, her voice 
low. “I have two sons: James and 
Charles. Two daughters: Mildred 
and Irene. There would have been a 
John, but — ” 

‘7 have two brothers,” said 
young John Laird, breathing in 
gasps, as though at high altitude, 
“Two brothers — James and 
Charles — and a sister Mildred.” 
He turned to the younger girl. “I 
don’t know what you’re doing 
here — I don’t have any sister 
Irene.” She shrank away. 

He reached a hand toward her. 
“Oh, wait — I’m not saying you 
shouldn't exist — I won’t do that to 
you. You’re here. I don’t under- 
stand it but I won’t tell you not to 
be here, the way Dad’s been telling 
me — ” He frowned. “I just don’t 
know why I’m not supposed to be 
here^that’s all. Because I live 
here. I’ve lived here all my life with- 
all of you — except Irene. And 
James was here, too — where’s my 
brother James?” 

“Your brother James,” Mr. 
Laird began, “I mean, my son 
James — was married last spring. 
He and his wife live north of here 
about forty miles, in the Horizon 
Hills complex.” He hunched his 
shoulders for a, moment, let them 
retax again. “I don’t see what this 



PEARSALL'S RETURN 



17 




has to do with your barging in, 
claiming to be my son. I should 
know how many children we 
have — ” 

Pearsall suddenly felt pity for 
them all — and some for himself. 
“Mrs. Laird, you said a moment 
ago that there would have been a 
son named John. Could you ex- 
plain that, please?” 

Color flooded her cheeks. For a 
moment he could see the pretty girl 
hiding behind the armor of 
fat — the ultimate disguise for 
beauty afraid of itself. “Mr. Pear- 
sall — Commander Pearsall, I 
mean — it’s not really any of your 
business, but if it will help this 
young man — well, when my James 
was two I had a son born dead. 
And his name would have been 
John.” 

“But James was two when I was 
bom,” young Laird protested. 
“And I grew up here and we 
all — you don’t know me? You 
don’t know me at all?” 

Five heads shook as one. 

Gently Pearsall said, “Don’t any 
of you see a family resemblance — a 
possible relationship? Couldn’t you 
start as cousins or something and 
work up?” He knew he was pushing 
too hard on something he didn’t 
fully understand, but his own needs 
were eating him. And some wild 
guesses were beginning to take 
shape. So he laid it on the line and 



hoped. “Can’t you try something?” 

He lost. “We can’t take a 
stranger into our home,” said the 
elder Laird. Bonita Laird’s mouth 
twitched, but she did not speak. Of 
them all, it was Irene who 
protested. 

‘7 wouldn’t mind if he stayed,” 
she said. She shook back her fair 
hair, fallen forward over one shoul* 
der. “I like him.” 

“Out of the question.” Her fa- 
ther’s face showed fear. Fear of 
what? 

Pearsall knew when to cut his 
losses. “Let’s go, John.” He gave 
the obligatory handshakes. 

Young Laird looked at each per- 
son in turn. He paused at Bonita 
but shook his head. He spoke only 
to Irene. “Thanks,” he muttered 
and touched her hand briefly. Pear- 
sall took his arm firmly and led 
him away. The boy’s luggage was 
at the front door — Pearsall picked 
it up and got the two of them out 
and safely away. 

In the car, before starting it, he 
said, “You’re not insane, John. 
You’re up against a problem that’s 
totally new, that’s all. And so am 
I.” 

P EARSALL had nowhere to go 
,but home — and there only if 
Glenna allowed it. If she did — he 
supposed Laird could stay also. 
What effect the boy’s presence 



18 



IF 




might have he couldn’t guess. To 
learn that the universe held other 
confusions, other entrapments, 
might help her. 

Driving through the night, his 
headlights carving a dark-walled 
tunnel as the road skirted a swamp, 
Pearsall explained his own 
problem. 

“So, to her,” he finished, “I’m 
an impostor. I have to be — she saw 
me dead.” He made a wordless 
sound. “I suppose I should find my 
grave and pay my respects.” 
“We’re in the same boat, aren’t 
we?” said Laird. “Except that your 
wife knows at least that she was 
married to you. My family simply 
doesn’t believe I exist — or ever did. 
I can’t understand it — what’s hap- 
pened to everybody?” 

“We happened to them. Other- 
wise they’re all perfectly sane, sen- 
sible people.” 

“Then we’re what’s wrong? Or 
has the whole world gone crazy?” 
“No, we’re fine, John — just fine. 
So far anyway. And as worlds go, 
this one is sane and good.” 

“Then what is wrong?” 

“Don’t you get it yet? Well, I’m 
not sure I do, either, in detail. But 
one thing’s clear — this perfectly 
good world isn't our world.” 

“You mean this isn’t Earth?” 
“Of course it’s Earth. 
But — different, somehow. Prob- 
ably more so than we’ve realized.” 



“You mean, my family back 
there — it isn’t really the one I grew 
up with?” 

“Almost, but not quite. They 
had a son bom dead, so they’re not 
the same people they’d be if he had 
lived. The difference isn’t 
much — except to you, who happen 
to be that son. You see?” 

Silence for a time, then: “Yes, I 
think so.” Then, after another brief 
pause: “This seems a funny thing 
for me to be worried about — but do 
you think they’ll ever accept me?” 
Laird’s voice shook. 

“Eventually, I imagine, when 
they understand what has hap- 
pened — when they’re told by some- 
one who can speak with authority. 
Keep your hopes up, but be 
patient — it may take a while.” 

“I’ll do that,” Laird said grimly, 
“and thanks. But what did 
happen?” 

“I’m afraid that’s the question of 
the century. I wish I could answer 
it” 

They were silent for the rest of 
the drive. An unfamiliar car was in 
Pearsall’s driveway. He parked at 
the curb. He took his remaining 
luggage from the car and motioned 
for Laird to bring his, also. This 
time, at the door, he used his 
key — once inside, luggage and all, 
his position would be stronger. 

As they went through the hall to 
the living room he heard conversa-

tion that broke off as they entered. 
Pearsall recognized the small, dark 
woman with Glenna. 

It was Glenna who spoke. 
“You’re back, I see.” Her voice 
was stiff and forced, close to the 
breaking point. “Well, maybe you 
can explain to Ludmilla here, 
where her husband is. She’s been 
asking me — and of course I don’t 
know.” 

“I don’t understand,” Pearsall 
began — but suddenly he did under- 
stand and realized he should have 
foreseen the complication. 

Ludmilla Frantiszek rose and 
faced him. Her hands were 
clenched tightly across her chest. 
The heavy black braid that fell for- 
ward over her left shoulder to her 
waist swayed with the slow ago- 
nized shaking of her head. 

“Where is Miro?” Her voice was 
low and ragged. “What have you 
done with my husband, you dead 
man who walks?” 

She stared blankly at him. 

Pearsall tried to answer, but 
could say only, “Milla — ” 

“Aw, you know me, do you? I 
knew you, too. And Miro knew 
you. We grieved at your funeral. 
And then Miro was gone a long 
eight months with Hawk Flight . I 
was not here when Hawk Flight re- 
turned— I was with my troupe in 
London, dancing. You remember 
that I am a dancer?” 



“Yes, Milla. And a very good 
one.” 

“Yes,” she nodded. “That is 
true — I am. When I heard, I re- 
turned. To the port. Hawk Flight's 
crew was gone, scattered to reunite 
with families for three days. They 
will be back on Tuesday, the fat- 
faced man said.” Pearsall nod- 
ded — he knew the one she meant. 

“But Miro,” he said,/ “has not 
come back. Instead there is you, 
who are dead. Tell me — you must 
tell me! How can this happen?” 

“Milla — Milla, I don’t know. 
Miro was not on Hawk Flight with 
me. He’d broken a leg skiing and 
was grounded while it healed. I 
took his place — he stayed at home. 
And somehow I have returned to a 
world in which you’ve seen me 
dead and Miro, not I, left on Hawk 
Flight as first officer. That’s all I 
know Milla. It’s not much help, but 
it’s true.” 

Black eyes wide under furrowed 
brow, she gazed at him as if trying 
to memorize him cell by cell. Fi- 
nally she nodded. “I believe you. I 
don’t understand all you say, but I 
never knew you to lie, Woody, 
while you were— ^alive.” She was 
trying not to cry, but could not stop 
her tears. “I will go now.” 

^She turned away. Pearsall 
moved toward her but Laird waved 
him back and took her arm, guid- 
ing her out. He did not return im-

mediately. Pearsall decided he was 
making sure she was in fit condi- 
tion to drive before letting her go. 

if'T'HEN I was right,” Glenna 
** said, suddenly breaking si- 
lence. “You’re not my Woody at 
all, are you? You’re some kind of 
Woody Pearsall, all right, but you 
never saw me before today. Nor I, 
you. You’re a close match. I can't 
see any differences yet — maybe I 
never will. But you’re simply 
not — my Woody!” 

Tears welled — it was Pearsall’s 
night for weeping ladies. 

“Oh, I wish you were!” 

He passed off the thought that 
her wish, literally taken, would 
make him dead— he knew her true 
meaning. “So do I, my dear,” he 
said. “You have no idea how much 
I wish it.” 

She ignored his words. “I should 
have known — I did know — when 
you said I’d cut my hair. Because I 
haven’t worn it long for nearly six 
years. I cut it when I had the role of 
Helen in that play — what was the 
name of it? I can’t remember — ” 
Pearsall couldn’t recall. her ever 
acting in any play at all. “And 
somehow I never got around to 
growing it long again. Though I 
should, really. But you didn’t 
know. So you can’t be my Woody, 
can you?” 

She asked the question as though 



it had an answer, so he gave her the 
best he had. “No, I’m not,” he 
said. “And you’re not quite my 
Glenna, either. But — ” and now for 
the first time he moved and 
touched her, took her by the shoul- 
ders to hold her facing him — “we 
are each the best — the best Woody 
and the best Glenna — that either of 
us is ever going to find.” 

She came to him and clung, sob- 
bing, but by the feel of her he knew 
it was still no good between them. 

At least, he thought, she had ac- 
cepted him as a friend. 

Ill 

P EARSALL and Glenna shared 
the same bedroom that 
night — Laird had the guest 
room — but not the same bed. 
Lying awake, he heard her slow, 
sleeping breath. He had steeled 
himself to being aroused and frus- 
trated by her nearness, but within 
him no Excitements stirred — he 
was as much disappointed as re- 
lieved. The thought came to him 
that his need to establish identity 
was stronger than his need for sex. 
When on a mission he schooled 
himself to celibacy. Some men and 
women formed shipboard liai- 
sons — he did not. Early on he had 
considered the idea — but apart 
from Glenna’s unorthodox monog- 
amist convictions he felt the plea- 



PEARSALL'S RETURN 



21 




sures did not compensate for the 
risk of jealousies and impaired mo- 
rale. He took no moralistic posi- 
tion, but felt that as a ship’s officer 
it was unwise for him to invite pos- 
sible trouble. 

At home, though, his urges were 
strong dnd frequent, not much di- 
minished by age. And so were 
Glenna’s — in the world he remem- 
bered they were well matched. 

He had to get away from that 
thought. Instead he considered 
what Glenna had said after Laird 
had returned from seeing Ludmilla 
Frantiszek safely on her way. 

“Admiral Forgues called,” she 
had told them, ~just before Milla 
came here. Everyone from Hawk 
Flight is to report back to duty to- 
morrow morning.” 

“Sunday?” 

“Yes. He said* it’s important.” 

“I’m sure it is. I wonder—” if 
it's really everyone , he thought, he 
wants there tommorow — or only 
me 

“Wonder what, Woody?” 

He hadn’t answered her. Any- 
thing he could have said would 
have sounded as paranoid as he had 
begun to feel. 

Now, lying alone as though he 
were on the ship and Glenna light- 
years away instead of a mere few 
feet, he still wondered. 

Sleep came eventually, much 
later than he wished. 



Next morning Glenna was cheer- 
ful in an impersonal way, as she 
served the two men breakfast. “I’ll 
expect you both home for dinner,” 
she said, “so call me if you can’t 
make it. And do let me know if you 
learn — well, anything that explains 
anything, won’t you?” 

“Of course, Glenna.” He wanted 
to say more, but it was no time to 
crowd his luck. Besides, Laird was 
there. 

Laird looked more at peace with 
himself. The night’s sleep must 
have helped. He said little, but 
smiled occasionally. 



A T THE spaceport he took a 
shortcut to the Administration 
Building — rather, to where he re- 
membered it to be. The building 
wasn’t there. In its place stood an 
old dilapidated warehouse. 

Now he remembered — the soar- 
ing tower he had looked for and 
hadn’t seen when he had been mak- 
ing his landing approach, was the 
new Administration building. He 
should have known before he had 
ever touched ground that this was 
not his world. 

He stopped the car and searched 
through memory. 

- “What’s the matter?” asked 
Laird. 

“Nothing. Well, yes — something 
is, in a way. John, do you remem- 



22 



IF 




ber the Ad Building and its tower?” 

“Of course. Why?” 

“Well, this is where it was. Now 
it isn’t. Let me think a minute. 
We’ll have to find the old building, 
the one our Space Service tore 
down,” 

Laird’s face went blank. He 
blinked rapidly several times. Pear- 
sall shook his head — just now he 
couldn’t afford to worry about 
Laird. 

The old building had been va- 
cated two or three years ago — he 
should be able to remember. Yes, 
he knew where to go. 

He was right. The building that 
he had seen razed was where it had 
been. He parked and used an elbow 
to nudge laird. “Come on, John. 
The admiral doesn’t like to be kept 
waiting.’? 

Inside the building Pearsall said, 
Hawk Flight — ” at each check- 
point and was passed through to 
Forgue’s receptionist without hav- 
ing to show identification. One 
desk removed from the admiral’s 
presence he repeated the name and 
added: “Where do we go?” 

“You are?” The girl was blond 
and pretty. A blue eye, her left, 
that aimed slightly outward, ac- 
cented her piquancy. It would be 
unwise of her, thought Pearsall, to 
correct that defect. 

“First Officer Pearsall,” he said. 
And pointing a thumb at his com- 



panion, “Navigator third John I- 
forget-the-initial Laird. We’re a 
little late. Where do we go, 
please?” 

“Oh — yes, sir. The small confer- 
ence room just off the admiral’s of- 
fice, to your right. You know it?” 
“Yes. Thank you.” He guided 
Laird along. They entered the 
room. 

From his seat at the end of the 
long table, Forgues peered up at 
them. At first look his head always 
seemed too large for his small 
frame, but Pearsall was accus- 
tomed to the discrepancy and ad- 
justed automatically. A quick 
count told him that he and Laird 
were the last to arrive. The dead, 
stuffy air of the drab room was 
heavy with anxiety. 

“Sorry we’re late, sir,” said 
Pearsall. “No excuses. But I think 
I have part of the answer to some 
of the questions you’ll be asking. ’ v 
“No doubt,” was the dry-toned 
answer. “You’re an intelligent 
man. You must have reached the 
same conclusions we have.” 

“I don’t understand. I 
thought — ” 

“You thought you were the only 
odd fish in the soup. Please find a 
seat, Commander — you too, 
Laird — and we’ll get down to it.” 
Confused but alert, Pearsall sat. 
“Let’s not waste time,” Forgues 
began. “I’ve heard some of your 



PEARSALL'S RETURN 



23 




stories. I believe them. We’ll get to 
your individual problems a little 
later. 

“About six hours after you dis- 
embarked I knew as a certainty 
that your ship was not the Hawk 
Flight we sent out eight months 
ago. Unfortunately, Commander 
Pearsall, I did not have this knowl- 
edge when I spoke to you at your 
home. But moments later tbe 
maintenance crew ran into a few 
problems — some of their testing 
procedures wouldn’t work. It took 
us a while to find out why, but 
when we did the answers told us a 
great deal. 

“Shortly before Hawk Flight left 
this port, the labs sent us a new set 
of modifications to improve con- 
trol efficiency. I put crews on over- 
time and got the work done in time__ 
for liftoff. Ourrepair crew’s prob- 
lem turned out to be that on your 
ship these changes had not been 
made. We checked and found that 
the departure date in your log is 
three days earlier than our records 
show. It is not the same ship — you 
are not the same people. There 
have been a number of repercus- 
sions ’’ 

P EARSALL saw a small, iri- 
descent, green insect crawling 
along the upper edge of the admi- 
ral’s collar, never quite touching 
his neck. Unable to look away 



from the little tightrope-walker, he 
felt akin to it — he wanted it to 
survive. 

“We have,’’ said Forgues, “three 
gross anomalies. Commander 
Pearsall, who was dead before 
Hawk Flight undertook its mis- 
sion, is now returned alive to us. 
My congratulations, Commander. 
Commander Miro Frantiszek was 
first officer of the Hawk Flight I 
know — your records show he was 
never aboard. And ours make no 
mention of Navigator Third John 
Laird, who is indisputably present. 

“Of the remaining twenty- 
two — many of you have encoun^ 
tered problems of your own. If you 
wish to discuss any of these, now 
would be a good time.” He looked 
around the table. “Prentice?” 

Second Officer Miles Prentice 
rose — a tall man, stooped and 
lean — and spoke in a low, intense 
voice. “I went to my a d- 
dress — someone else lives there. 
When I finally found my wife, she 
said we’ve been divorced more than 
three years. She’s remarried and 
has two new children. I don’t know 
what to do,” Shaking his head, he 
sat down again,, 

Forgues looked at him but said 
nothing. He acknowledged a raised 
Jiand. “Chandri?*’ 

“I was married, too. But now I 
find that my wife — I said goodbye 
to her only eight months ago — has 




been dead nearly five years. It’s in- 
sane, that’s all. Or I am.” 

“You’re not,” said the admiral. 
“Only— misplaced.” 

The testimony continued. “Geh- 
ring — Lena Gehring. I was a 
widow with a son in boarding 
school, a married daughter and a 
grandson. Now I’m a childless 
spinster. I’d rather be dead.” 

“Cheng here, second pilot. Last 
year my wife and I moved to a new 
house — but somehow it turns out 
we didn’t. Nothing else is much 
different.” 

“Johnson. I was a bachelor, but 
now I seem to have a wife and two 
kids. I’m not complaining — I like 
it.” 

“Lightfoot. I drew good cards. 
My husband was a hopeless 
drunk — and I do mean hopeless. 
Here he’s been dry for the last four 
years.” 

“Ramirez. I went home. It 
wasn’t my place and never has 
been. My wife's folks never heard 
of me and she*s married to some- 
body else. So I looked myself up in 
the directory. I have a wife I never 
saw before. It's a little scary, but I 
think it'll work out okay — she's 
pretty nice.” 

“Timon — Aldred Timon. There 
are some minor differences but 
nothing serious. It doesn’t bother 
me any.” 

“Parelli, it says on the roster. I 



have a different husband but I 
probably would anyway by this 
time, even if I’d stayed home. I al- 
ways seem to marry the wrong 
type. I think maybe this one is a 
little better than average.” 

“I’m Red Sarchet, drive tuner. I 
live with my folks, like always. But 
down at the corner bar they all let 
on I was one of the gay guys. I’m 
not — I don’t have anything against 
them, but I’m not. I had to fight 
one fellow. I’m not going back 
there.” 

“Gerard, communications. I 
didn’t have anybody before and I 
still don’t. I live in a new place. 
What’s the difference?” 

“Vaille, captain. I found some 
problems to be worked out, but 
nothing insurmountable.” 

On and on it went, all through 
the twenty-two. One short, fat man 
said only, “I pass.” Looking at 
him, Pearsall recalled his name, 
Crawford, and his job, supply 
clerk. Nothing more came to mind, 
from eight months on the same 
ship. 

Poor Crawford , he thought. 

The consensus was almost evenly 
divided between those adjusting 
successfully to the changes and 
those finding them from distressing 
to intolerable. What could anyone 
do for Chandri or Gehring? 

Forgues muttered into the inter- 
com — the pretty blonde came al- 



PE A RSALL'S RETURN

most immediately with a big pot 
and a tray of cups. As the coffee 
ritual began the admiral spoke 
again. 

“Your attention, please.” The 
green insect was gone. Pearsall 
hadn’t seen it go, didn’t know 
whether or not it was still circum- 
navigating the admiral. “For what 
help it might be, I’ll tell you as 
much ar I understand of what has 
happened. 

“It seems we didn’t know 
enough about the Skip Drive. Of 
course the press stories, that it 
beats lightspeed by going through 
hyperspace, are a lot of horse 
puckie — there’s no such thing as 
hyperspace. But all we had to 
know — in operations — was that it 
works. It took us there and it 
brought us back. For ten years, on 
the shorter hauls our power sources 
could handle, we had no trouble. 
So last year when we got the Krie- 
ger power units, we pushed perfor- 
mance as high as we could. 

“Now, I had a two-hour lecture 
last night, by a top man from the 
labs. I won’t take two hours to tell 
you, because I didn’t understand 
that much of it. But I’ll tell you the 
parts I did get.” 

T HE little bug reappeared, sit- 
ting like a tiny epaulette on the 
admiral’s left shoulder. Pearsall 
was glad to see it. 



“The trick is that space and time 
are quantized. If you don’t know 
what that means, wait and ask me 
later. Mainly, the universe doesn't 
exist continuously. It pul- 
sates — appears and disappears at a 
rate much too high to measure. So 
when you move you do it by van- 
ishing at one point and reappearing 
at the next — normally. 

“Ordinarily, in moving we hit ev- 
ery point along the way. Skip Drive 
suppresses our appearances at 
most of those points. We beat 
lightspeed because it’s the ins and 
outs that use up time and energy, 
not the motion itself.” 

“Excuse me, sir.” It was Captain 
Vaille who spoke. “Was it ex- 
plained how the relativistic effects 
are avoided? That’s one.thing I’ve 
never understood and it bothers 
me. 

“I can’t give you the math for it, 
Captain — ’’ Vaille smiled and 
shook his head — “but the way Dr. 
Kunda at the labs put it, velocity 
has to do with the number of ap- 
pearances, not the distance be- 
tween them. So at a Skip-factor of 
ten your theoretical limit is ten 
lights, not one. And of course we 
never push that limit — our in- 
struments are redlined at ten per 
cent time-mass variation, which 
we’ve found acceptable. 

“Nice, isn’t it? We thought we 
had the universe by its short hairs. 



26 



IF 




So we sent you out at top Skip-f ac- 
tor — well over a thousand, I be- 
lieve — and instead of coming back 
to where you once belonged you 
came here instead. 

“Kunda told me why. There are 
more worlds than one — more than 
we could count, I expect. There 
have to be — to explain what’s hap- 
pened. They run side-by-side in 
time and ordinarily you stay in 
your own rut — no way to get out of 
it. But on high Skip-factor, with 
the checkpoints fewer and farther 
between, so to speak, you can drift 
into a new and different set of 
probabilities. The higher and 
longer you Skip the farther you 
may drift from the world you 
know. That’s why you’re here in- 
stead of there. 

“And you can’t get back.” 
“Huh?” 

“Why?” 

“Why not?” 

Several people were speaking at 
once. Pearsall remained quiet. And 
the little green insect had vanished 
again. 

“You could try,” said Forgues. 
“go out again and take your 
chances. But you’d probably find a 
set of circumstances even more 
strange to you. effects on any one 
trip appear to be random, but may 
well be cumulative. You might 
come closer to your original 
world— then again, you might not. 



The odds aren’t necessarily favor- 
able. In fact, indications point to 
the contrary.” 

“Then where do we stand?” 
someone demanded. “What are we 
supposed to do?” 

“I don’t know,” Forgues said. 
His voice was flat, deliberate. 
“When I do. I’ll be sure to inform 
you.” 

Pearsall spotted his small green 
friend. It had flown, while he 
wasn’t looking, to a window ledge. 
He felt himself released from an 
anxiety he hadn’t consciously 
noticed. 

“Sir,” he said, “is there anything 
more for us to do here, now? Or 
may we leave?” 

As Forgues began to answer, the 
door opened. The fey-eyed recep- 
tionist failed to block the entrance 
of the aide Pearsall had seen on his 
picturephone. The chubby man 
spoke. 

“Admiral, sir, a ship has 
landed.” 

Pearsall thought Forgues would 
explode into harangue, but he said, 
level-toned, “Thank you, Abbott, 
for the information. But ships land 
here quite often, I believe. This is 
an important conference. Why did 
you interrupt it?” 

“Sir, I thought you might want 
to know immediately about this 
particular landing. The ship is 
Hawk Flight 



PEARSALL'S RETURN

IV 

F ORGUES broke the intent sil- 
lence. “Is it ours this time?” 

“It seems to be — or as near as 
makes no difference. At least the 
roster checks out. And the time of 
departure.” 

Forgues sighed. “My friends, it 
seems we have a whole new ball 
game. I have no idea how to cope 
with it. I welcome any suggestions.” 
“Just a minute, sir,” said Pear- 
sall. He turned to the chubby news- 
bearer. “Are all crew members 
alive and well?” 

“Yes, they are,” the man said. 
“Why?” 

“Excuse me, Admiral.” Without 
waiting for a response, Pearsall 
walked into the receptionist’s of- 
fice, closing the door gently. 

“May I use your phone?” The 
girl nodded. He punched the re- 
membered number — after a few 
seconds a picture lighted. 

The woman’s eyes were swollen 
but dry. Her black mass of hair 
swung loose. Her right hand held a 
brush. 

“Milla,” he said. “The other 
Hawk Flight has landed, the one 
that belongs here*. Miro has come 
home.” 

The brush dropped unnoticed. 
Her eyes filled. She smiled like a 
very young child seeing the antics 
of clowns. “Miro? Miro! Oh, how 



wonderful! You have just learned?" 

“About thirty seconds ago. I 
called you, first thing.” 

“Oh, thank you. Woody — thank 
you! You have seen him?” 

“Not yet. But all crew members 
are reported alive and well.” 
“Shall I come there?” 

“I — I don’t know Milla. Does 
Miro usually call from the port, 
when he lands?” 

“Yes. Always.” 

“Then I’m sure he will now, as 
soon as he can. Why don’t you wait 
for his call, then decide between 
you where to meet?” 

“Yes, that is best. Though wait- 
ing will be very hard.” 

“Yes, Milla — I know. But it’s 
not for long now.” My God , he 
thought — she looks ten years 
younger. “Look, Milla — I’d better 
get off this line so Miro can get 
through to you as soon as he has 
the chance. And I’m very happy for 
you.” 

“Yes. Thank you. I hope also for 
your happiness. And now, 
goodbye.” 

Shutting off the phone, Pearsall 
thanked the receptionist for its use 
and returned to the conference 
room. It stank of desperation. 

“Has anything been decided?” 
he said. 

“Where the hell have you been, 
Pearsall?” Forgues snapped. 
“Telling Ludmilla Frantiszek 



28 



IF 




she has her husband back, sir. I 
thought somebody should.” 

“Oh, yes — yes, of course! Sorry, 
Pearsall. Glad you thought of it.” 
“It’s all right, sir. Does anyone 
know what comes next?” 

“Not so you’d notice it. The 
other crew should be through medi- 
cal check before much longer. I’ll 
have to talk to them, explain the 
situation — I suppose they’ve heard 
a garbled version from someone 
and are feeling anxious, to say the 
least.” 

Forgues scowled. “I should have 
thought of that and issued instruc- 
tions.” 

“When?” asked Pearsall. “Beg- 
ging your pardon, but none of us 
anticipated this landing until it 
happened — and then the first 
people to talk with the ship would 
naturally let out the whole story.” 
“What?” The admiral's pre- 
occupation was evident. “Oh, yes, 
you’re right.” He rapped on the 
table for the group’s attention. 
“Well, I’d better give the situation 
readout as I see it.” He looked 
around at all of them. “For some 
of you this new development must 
be one blow too many. Having to 
readjust to living someone else's 
life was bad enough, terrible in 
some cases. And now the someone 
else has come to take up his or her 
own life and you must live with 
that, too:” 



He sighed and shook his head/ 
“One thing is clear — your careers 
are secure. You’re all competent 
people in your own right. Despite 
the fact that someone else now 
shares your name there will be a 
place for you. We’ll find a w£y to 
straighten out the records. You 
needn’t worry about any of that. 
I’ll take care of it.” 

He frowned. “Now, your per- 
sonal lives. Each case will need its 
own unique solution, I expect. 
Some of you may have to give up 
your families — and no help for it. 
Or your alter-ego may want out of 
his current life situation and bow 
out in your favor — it’s not impos- 
sible, but don’t count on it, Or 
some of you — and your doubles 
and. your families, might agree to 
share your lives — multiple mar- 
riages aren’t common, but they are 
legal. And it could be arranged for 
any pair of doubles to ship out al- 
ternately, if that would help. The 
service will make counseling avail- 
able to any who feel the need for it. 
Don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll see that 
the red tape is bypassed.” Forgues 
looked at his watch. “Please re- 
main here while I speak to the 
other crew. I’ll arrange for lunch to 
be brought in. Then I want to be 
present at the first meeting of each 
pair of doubles, in privacy — maybe 
I can help you accept each other’s 
existence a little more easily. 



PEARSALL'S RETURN 



29 




“I realize the procedure will be 
time-consuming, but at the mo- 
ment I can’t think of a better one. 
Your welfare is my responsibility 
and I intend to discharge that re- 
sponsibility as best I can. That’s all 
I have to say at this time. I’ll have 
somebody hustle that lunch for 
you.” 

“Sir,” said Pearsall. “Laird and 
I have no doubles to meet. But we 
do have personal problems of our 
own, each of us. May we have your 
permission to leave now?” 

“What? Oh, yes. And Frantis- 
zek, in the other crew. I’ll call and 
have him released if Abbott hasn’t 
thought to do so— which I doubt.” 
The admiral turned to leave. As 
Pearsall and Laird followed him 
out, they paused to wave restrained 
goodbyes. In a way Pearsall felt 
like a deserter— but what more 
could he do here? He hurried to 
catch up with Forgues. 

“When do you want us back 
here, sir?” 

“Tomorrow morning. No, make 
it after lunch. I may be up most of 
the night with those twenty-two 
pairs of doppelgangers — and I’ll 
need some sleep.” 

They parted. Outside, Pearsall 
noticed a new gouge along the. side 
of the drab little rental car. Some 
things never change, he 
thought — he remembered his 
grandfather complaining about 



“damned idiots in parking lots.” 
And throughout most of his child- 
hood young Elwood thought 
“idiots” were strange creatures 
who lurked in parking lots and 
lived only to ravage the cars of in- 
nocent grandfathers. 

The vagrant memory eased his 
tension. He found himself smiling. 



T HE morning drive had been 
hectic. Homeward bound he 
drove more leisurely, wondering 
what he could do or say to help his 
cause with Glenna. Not much, he 
decided— she had all the pieces and 
would have to put them together 
herself. Neither he nor Laird spoke 
during the drive. He didn’t know 
what the boy was thinking and, just 
then, he didn’t want to know. He’d 
think about Laird’s problem later 
and help if he could. 

Before they reached home he 
was sweating — the morning had 
been cool, but now it was past noon 
and Indian-summer hot. He’d have 
to take time, he thought, to turn in 
this rental contraption and get his 
own car out of storage. 

Glenna greeted the two men 
cheerfully enough. She wore light- 
weight halter and x briefs in a color- 
ful print pattern. Pearsall went 
straight to the refrigerator and was 
pleased to find a pitcher of daiqui- 
ris cooling, as in earlier, happier 



30 



IF 




times. He took a little in a glass 
and sipped it, before taking a cool 
shower and changing into shorts 
and sandals. 

Glenna, when he rejoined her, 
was setting out cold cuts and salad. 
The sound of running water from 
the basement shower indicated that 
Laird was also cooling off. Pearsall 
poured himself a full glass from the 
pitcher and sipped from it between 
bites of cheese, liverwurst, salad 
and crackers. He kept the silence 
until she broke it. 

“Woody — Laird told me what 
happened.” 

“That Hawk Flight came back? 
The one that belongs here?” "" 

“Yes. Why didn’t you tell me? 
And what does it mean? What hap- 
pens now?” 

“I wanted us to take our time 
talking about it. And I needed that 
cold shower first. Mind?” She 
shook her head. “Well, first it 
means that most of my crew have 
doubles and may be excess baggage 
on this world.” He summarized 
Forgues’ conclusions, then added: 
“Tomorrow, after he’s talked with 
all the pairs, we’ll have a better 
idea of how they’re reacting. It’s 
not going to be easy for most, I’m 
afraid.” 

She was rubbing a knuckle 
alongside her nose, looking steadily 
over it. “But, then Miro Frantiszek 
is back. Does Milla know?” 



“I called her immediately, as 
soon as we heard.” 

“Yes — you would. You were al- 
ways thoughtful — in my world.” 
He had to speak. “It seemed that 
I — that my Hawk Flight — ever 
since we landed, had been doing 
nothing but make people unhappy. 
I guess I jumped at the chance to 
make somebody happy for a 
change. I think it did me as much 
good as it did Milla.” 

He touched his cold glass to his 
right ear — the chill was refreshing. 
Changing hands, he gave the other 
ear the same treatment and grinned 
at Glenna. She began to smile back 
at him. The door chime inter- 
rupted. 

“I’ll get it.” She rose and went to 
the door. From where he sat, Pear- 
sall couldn’t see whom she greeted. 

“Yes, he’s here. Please come 
in.” What did they want with him 
now? But into the room Glenna 
ushered Bonita and Irene Laird. 

H E STOOD and saw them 
seated, offered and served 
drinks, returned to his own chair. 
The two Lairds weren’t talking, so 
Pearsall took the plunge. “You’re 
here to see John? He should be 
coming soon. He’s been showering, 
but the water stopped running a 
minute ago.” 

Mrs. Laird leaned forward. 
“The problem was my husband. 



PEARSALL'S RETURN

yi>u sec — not me. This thing is like 
a superstition or something with 
him. I wouldn't have turned young 
John away — he needed us. I could 
see that.” She rubbed her hands to- 
gether. “But my husband — he’s 
John* too, of course; I suppose Fd 
get used to that — he wouldn’t have 
it. Charles and Mildred never could 
stand up to him any more than I 
can, except just once in a while. 
James and Irene have all the family 
spunk.” She smiled tentatively and 
fell silent. 

“Yes, Mrs. Laird?” said Pear- 
sall. “Go on.” 

“Well. After you left Irene 
wouldn’t let it go. She just kept 
on — didn’t you, honey?” The girl 
blushed and nodded. “I agreed 
with her that we should have taken 
the boy in, .but John — my 
John— never listens to me unless I 
throw a fit and a set of dishes. 
Well — not quite that bad, really. 
Usually things aren’t important 
enough and I let him have his way. 
This time, though, I stood with 
Irene. Any time she ran out of 
steam I came in for her. But still 
my John wouldn’t have it.” Now 
she sat upright. “Then James 
called on the phone. It was late by 
then. He’d seen the news about 
Hawk Flight and the John Laird 
who wasn’t on the records. They 
showed a picture of him and told 
his address on v the ship’s 



books— our address. So James J 
called us, even that late.” 1 

“What did he say?” If he could 1 
keep her talking, Pearsall thought, J 
sooner or later she’d get to the *4 
point. Jji* 

“He asked had we seen the news? J 
My John said we’d seen more than | 
that— the man had come here | 

»rs 

saying we’re his family. James 1 
asked, well, where is he? John said 
he’d sent him packing. And James 
called his father some names — very 
disrespectful, James was.” 

Pearsall raised his glass to hide a 
grin. “And then what happened?” 
“James said he didn’t < under-r 
stancP it, but when he saw young 
John’s picture his spine went cold. 
That he knew he couldn’t ever have 
seen him before, but he felt he rec- 
ognized him. Then he said if We 
didn’t take the boy in, he would.” 
“And I said, good for them.” 
Irene spoke for the first time. Her 
voice was low and clear. “And I 
asked James did they have room 'j 
for me, too?” 

“That’s right, honey — you did. 
And right there I had enough. T 
love my John, but sometimes— I 
shouldn’t say" it, though it’s 
true — he’s a pigheaded fool! I’d 
carried a son nine months, I said, 
and lost him — a woman never gets 
over that. Now somehow I had a 
chance to get him back alive and 
I’d be eternally damned if anyone

was going to take that chance away 
from me! We argued late, to 
daylight — didn’t get up until noon 
today. John missed work, first day 
in years. But he finally agreed last 
night and stands by it today. He 
still complains a little but that’s 
just show — he does hate to lose an 
argument. So here we are, Irene 
and I— if the boy still wants any- 
thing to do with us.” 

Pearsall walked back along the 
hall to the basement door across 
from the kitchen. He shouted down 
the stairs. 

“Laird. John Laird, get your 
lazy carcass up here. You’re going 
home.” 

“Yes, I know.” Coming from 
the kitchen, behind Pearsall, the 
voice sounded thick, as though is- 
suing from a constricted throat. “I 
heard.” 

r T HE Lairds, all three, had gone. 

Pearsall felt wrung out. Into a 
short glass he poured bourbon over 
ice — daiquiris were all well and 
good, but at the moment he wanted 
a little more bite. 

“Well, that’s two happy endings 
today.” His voice and smile were 
gentle. “Care to try for three?” 

Glenna stiffened noticeably. 
“Woody, I can’t take that — not 
just now. Couldn’t you have 
waited? I was coming to like 
you — I do like you — but now 



you’ve brought it all back. That 
you’re not my real husband.” 

“Your real husband is dead.” 
Maybe a little shock treatment 
would work. “You saw him 
dead — you said so. Now tell me 
— hadn’t you ever thought of 
remarrying? Were you going to 
waste the rest of your life mooning 
over a rotting corpse?” 

She shrank visibly into herself. 
Her face paled. He could see the 
light dusting of freckles normally 
masked by her healthy coloring. 

“I — I might have remarried. I 
had no one in mind, but of course 
I’ve thought of it. But not like 
this — you’re asking me simply to 
let you move in here in place of my 
Woody. That’s not remarriage.” 
She shook her head. “You know 
my beliefs, my monogamist up- 
bringing. You accepted all that 
when you married me. Didn’t 
you?” 

He overlooked the gaps in her 
logic. Yes, he thought, he’d ac- 
cepted her views — perhaps more 
thoroughly than she knew. All 
right, he’d play it her way. 

“Well, then Glenna. will you 
marry me?” 

“No, I won’t.” Instant, level- 
voiced anger. “You’re making fun 
of me.” 

He took a deep breath and ex- 
haled carefully, stifling the words 
that would estrange her beyond re- 



34 



IF 




call. In his mind he rephrased what 
he would have to say next — win or 
lose. 

“Glenna — isn’t this all a bit pre- 
tentious? I mean, it’s not as though 
there had never been anyone else 
for you — besides the Woody who is 
dead.” 

“What do you mean?” Gripping 
the arms of her chair, she started to 
rise. “Of course there has been no 
one else. I came to you a vir- 
gin — don’t you believe that now?” 
“You are surely mixing up your 
Woodys, now aren’t you? Yes — 
certainly I believe it. That’s not 
what I’m talking about.” 

“Then just what are you talking 
about?” 

He sighed. “All right. I’d never 
intended to throw it up to 
you — never thought I’d have 
to — but we both know you broke 
your own special rules after I had 
come to accept them. I knew about 
you and Piers Carlton when he was 
directing the Little Theater in 
Spring Harbor.” 

She stood frozen, mute — he had 
to go on. “It doesn’t matter now, 
Glenna. After the miscarriage I 
could understand — you needed 
something I couldn’t give you. And 
I judged that Carlton wasn’t the 
sort who would ever be unkind to 
you. So Pendured it and never held 
it against you — until now, when 
you turn me away.” 



Wide-eyed, she shook her head. 
“But I didn’t, Woody— I didn’t! 
No, listen — let me talk. I thought 
of it, yes — I played around with the 
idea. In a way it fascinated me. 
You’re right — I needed something. 
We had had all those years of hop- 
ing — and finally I was pregnant. 
And then the miscarriage and the 
doctor said I could never have the 
child I’d come so close to having. I 
think I was a little crazy, Woody, 
for a while. And I did flirt with 
Piers Carlton — that’s true. But he 
got me interested in the theater, in- 
stead. So ' then I found what I 
needed — but on the stage, not on 
the casting couch.” 

It was Pearsall’s turn to shake 
his head. “Glenna, don’t bother to 
lie to me.” 

“Lie? I’m not lying! Why should 
I lie to a man I’m rejecting?” 

“I have no idea. But, you see — I 
caught you. I came home and 
found you together on the bed. You 
didn’t see or hear me — I went out 
again and stayed away until he was 
gone. Afterward, until I was sure it 
was over, I took care to give fair 
warning of my comings and goings 
and to make it easy for you to find 
excuses to meet him.” 

She was frowning, intent. 
“Why would you do that?” 

JJE SHRUGGED. “I’m not 
-®-sure. I suppose — I thought

you’d be having enough problems 
with guilt without my piling shame 
on top of it.” He was getting off the 
point — oh, yes! “But another 
thing, Glenna — you were never in a 
play or on the stage in your life. 
Why do you try to tell me such 
things?” 

She stared at him silently. Then 
she laughed — and laughed and' 
laughed. Finally she stopped and 
wiped her eyes. 

“Oh, Woody! To paraphrase 
you — you’re mixing up your 
Glennas. Your Glenna may have 
done all you say — since you say it 
I’ll believe you. But I didn’t. And I 
did act on the stage. I have my 
keepsakes, the theater programs. 
Would you like to see them?” 

He was trying to comprehend, to 
absorb what she bad said. “I’d like 
to later, yes. But now I’ll take your 
word for them, though what you 
tell me is hard to understand. But 
I’m still interested in only one 
thing — where do we stand, you and 
I?” 

A vertical crease formed and 
deepened between her brows. “Sep- 
arately, I’m afraid.” She paused. 
“You can sleep in the guest room 
tonight — now that Laird has 
gone— but tomorrow you’d better 
go somewhere else. Or I’ll leave if 
you insist. I need to be apart from 
you.” 

“Why?” 



“Because we do mix up our 
Woodys and our Glennas. You 
think you know me, but you don’t. 
And every time I come to feel that. 
I know you I find I don’t, not at all. 
How many more pitfalls are there 
in our separate pasts that we’d 
stumble into if we tried to make a 
future together? I don’t know. And 
I’m afraid to find out.” 

Frustration bit at his nerves and 
muscles like electric shock, bring- 
ing him perilously near the edge of 
violence. He took a deep breath. 
Then, forcing himself to sit still 
while looking at his not-wife, he 
said, “All right. I’ll leave in the 
morning. I’ll take my luggage and I 
won’t be back. You can ship the 
rest of my stuff — anything that’s 
still around here — when I have a 
place for it. I’ll let you know and 
pay the freight. This place is yours. 
It was silly, Glenna, for you to of- 
fer to move out.” 

“No. It’s only legally mine. You 
have as much right to everything as 
I do.” 

“But not to you?” 

“No — not to me.” 

There was nothing he could say. 
He looked at his watch — it was 
mid-afternoon. Suddenly he 
couldn’t face staying in this house 
through all the hours until dawn. 
He rose to his feet. 

“I might as well gather my travel 
gear and go now, Glenna.” 



36 



IF 




She stood, also. “What do you 
plan to do?” 

“Ship out again, I suppose.” He 
could still muster a grin. “Next 
time I may come-back to a world 
I’m better suited to.” 

He was ready to leave in a few 
minutes. Awkwardly, encumbered 
by his three pieces of luggage, he 
paused in the living room. Silent 
and withdrawn, she looked up at 
him but did not speak. 

He made no move to set down 
the luggage or to touch her. 

“Goodbye, Glenna.” 

When she made no answer he 
started to move away. Then she 
said, “Goodbye, Woody—” and 
looked away again. 

Outside, he stowed his gear in 
the car. He looked up at the broken 
chimney that someone else would 
have to repair. Then he slid under 
the wheel and drove toward the 
city. 

He registered at a hotel near the 
spaceport. He could have taken 
quarters at the port itself, but he 
didn’t yet feel up to mingling with 
service personnel. He needed to be 
alone. 

He had dinner, but didn’t eat 
much. He bought a book but, back 
in his room, read very little. He had 
a bottle, also, but drank sparingly. 
He went to bed early. 

It was the longest night he’d ever 
known. 

PEARSALL'S RETURN 



E AWOKE dull-brained and 
heavy-eyed. A shower helped 
and the automatic routine of morn- 
ing soothed him. He rummaged for 
clean clothes — in some cases he 
was down to his last item. Some 
things were missing. Glenna must 
have laundered them, he thought 
and had forgotten to tell him. He 
dressed as best he could. 

In the hotel’s restaurant he had 
breakfast — steak and eggs, witty 
more black coffee than his nerves 
needed. 

Outside he felt the sun’s warmth, 
though it shone vaguely through 
ground haze. Two blocks away he 
found a store that carried clothing. 
He bought a few things he needed. 
He walked back to the hotel, got 
his duffel together and checked 
out. 

Through mists that lessened as 
the sun burned them away, he 
drove to the port. He registered for 
quarters and moved his luggage 
into a clean, featureless cubicle. He 
placed his shaving kit and some 
other trivia on the dresser top to 
identify the room for him next time 
he entered it. 

He looked at his watch: 1040. 
The Administration Building was 
less than two miles away — it would 
make a nice walk, he decided, and 
headed in that direction. 

At 1115 hours, wide-awake now 
but not overheated, he approached 

ii 





Admiral Forgues’ office. He rated 
a smile from the receptionist with 
the entrancingly off-track eye. She 
wore an electric-blue dress. With 
her pale skin and hair it made her 
look like a child playing grownup. 
Pearsall liked the ef- 
fect — momentarily he wished he 
could shed half his birthdays. 

Through the thin office door the 
admiral’s telephone voice rumbled 
unmistakably. Pearsall raised his 
eyebrows toward the sound. The 
girl nodded and he entered the ad- 
miral’s presence just as Forgues 
said, “Well, do it, then,” and shut 
off the phone. 

“Morning, Pearsall. You’re here 
early.” 

“Yes sir. I’m anxious about 
some of our people and wondered 
how the interviews came out. If 
you’re not busy—” 

“Not especially. Most of the 
talks went faster than I’d expected. 
I got almost enough sleep — as 
much as I usually get, anyway.” 
“Congratulations, sir.” 

“The situation is not as bad as I 
feared, Pearsall. To begin with, at 
Captain Vaille’s suggestion I had 
as many spouses and other family 
members brought here as I could 
reach on short notice. I included 
them iathe interviews once the ini- 
tial meetings were over. I think 
their presence helped a great deal 
in a number of cases. 



“Vaille himself was no 
trouble — in either of his identities. 
When the two met, one said, “Do 
you suppose our wife will agree 
that she can’t have too much of a 
good thing?’ They both 
laughed— 'thea Mrs. Vaille came 
in. At first it bothered her that she 
couldn’t tell them apart, so your 
Vaille took scissors and trimmed 

his mustache short. Then she re- 

/ 

laxed and rapport between the 
three was good. In fact, I prevailed 
upon them to stay for the rest of 
the interviews and I think their ex- 
ample was of help to others who 
were less secure.” 

“Yes, sir — that’s the captain, all 
right. He doesn’t talk much, stays 
out of the limelight — but he’s never 
at a loss.” 

“True. Well, then, not to bog 
you dowrf with details — eight other 
triangular households are launched 
successfully, including three with 
the wife duplicated. In six cases 
your shipmate was displaced by his 
or her twin and in three the other 
crewman was displaced. Leav- 
ing — let me see — ” he referred to a 
scribbled list — “four pairs of 
‘twins’ who, forgone reason or an- 
other, are quite adrift in this world. 
So we have seventeen who are ef- 
fectively ‘displaced persons.’ I hope 
we can find some way to help 
them.” Forgues scowled. “No, I 
forgot — make that sixteen. Your

IF 




version of Lena Gehring killed her- 
self during the night. I’m 
sorry — did you know her well?” 

Shaking his head, Pearsall felt a 
pang. He hadn’t known her at all. 
If he had, could he have helped? 

“But you’d better make it sev- 
enteen again, sir,” he said. “I 
qualify.” 

“Oh?” Forgues raised his eye- 
brows, started to speak, but shook 
his head and began again? “Sorry 
to hear that. And how about young 
Laird?” 

“He’ll be all right. The family 
decided to give him a try.” 

“Good. And Frantiszek’s in safe 
harbor, too. The only problem is 
that I can’t reach him — he’s dis- 
connected his phone.” 

Pearsall laughed. “I can’t say I 
blame her.” 

“What? Oh, yes — of course. 
Well, that’s the wrapup. Unfortu- 
nately I can’t do much about the 
loose ends just now — they’ve sad- 
dled me with another insoluble 
problem.” 

“Another, sir?” 

“The courier ships — were those 
on the boards in your world before 
you left?” 

“Hmmm — yes, sir. Little two- 
person cans, weren’t they? With 
Skip-factors into five or six fig- 
ures— the idea was to provide 
faster communications between 
here and the colonies. And expedite 



the high-priority small cargo.” 

“That’s right. Well, the ships are 
built — almost ready to deliver. We 
put a lot of money into that 
project. And now’ we can’t use the 
damned things!” 

“Can’t use them? Oh, of 
course — I see.” 

“Yes. Who’ll pilot a ship that 
can’t come home again? And what 
good are messages to an alternate 
world?” 

After a moment, Pearsall did 
see. Oh, God, how he saw! “Sir — I 
think — your two problems solve 
each other!” 

“How’s that? What do you 
mean?” 

“The difference between one 
world and another may be impor- 
tant to individuals, sir, but on the 
larger scale — politics, economics, 
commerce — it would be minor, 
even unnotioeable. Every version of 
Harper’s Touchdown is going to 
need new counter-agents against 
the cyclic insect mutations, for in- 
stance. And — well, draw your own 
examples, sir — you have more data 
on the colonies than I do. And 
communications dealing with over- 
all problems rather than individual 
ones will still be valid — especially if 
the first messages explain the mul- 
tiple-world concept, to alert every- 
one to be on the lookout for dis- 
crepancies. “If our thinking is 
careful, 'sir, the courier ships can do 



PEARSALL'S RETURN 



39 




almost exactly the job they were 
planned for.” 

“But who will run them?” 

“I will, for one — and probably 
most of your other displaced per- 
sons will volunteer. You see — it’s 
our only chance to find a world we 
can live in.” 

“But, Pearsall — you know how 
little chance you have of finding 
what you have lost.” 

“Yes, sir — I do know. But, what 
about a woHd in which I have no il- 
lusory ties that don’t really work? 
Where I never met Glenna and 
never will? In a world like that I 
could feel free to make a new start. 
Here I can’t.” 

For a time Forgues was silent. 
Then: “Yes — I see. But how do we 
run a courier system with seventeen 
people — seventeen who will work 
at it only until they find a place to 
call home?” 

“How many other ships — after 
Hawk Flight — went out long-haul 
at high Skip-factor and that aren’t 
back yet? And from how many 
worlds? I’m afraid our seventeen 
are only the first of many. And 
think of this, too— the possibilities 
of exchange of information be- 
tween worlds. It will be random, 
but over the long haul the law of 
averages will make it work. Too, 
you’ll find people attracted to the 
program for the adventure of it. 
Younger men particularly.” 



“Hmm — it might work. It just 
might, at that. For a time at least, 
until someone comes up with a bet- 
ter idea.” He paused. “Pearsall, 
before you go looking for yout bet- 
ter world I want you to help me get 
this thing organized.” He stood. 
“Now let’s get on with our next 
conference. At least, thanks to you, 
I have something to say 
there — besides a lot of platitudes.” 



ASHE followed Forgues, Pear- 
*^sall almost felt good. It wasn’t 
every day, he thought, that a mere 
commander heard two sets of prob- 
lems from an admiral and handed 
him the answer to both — on a plat- 
ter, with an apple in its mouth. 
Yes, he felt almost good. 

The cute cockeyed blonde smiled 
up at him as he passed her desk. He 
returned the smile absently and 
continued in the admiral’s wake, 
but she called after him. 

“Commander Pearsall?’’ He 
turned. “I have a message for 
you — please call your wife. You 
may use this phone if you like.” 
He called to the departing admi- 
ral. “Sir? Excuse me — I’ll be along 
shortly.” Forgues waved assent. 

What, thought Pearsall, could 
Glenna possibly have to say to him 
now? It had all been said. What 
further excuses, rationalizations, 
could she offer? He punched out 



40 



IF 




the number and waited until the 
screen lit. \ 

“Woody?” Her robe hung awry. 
Her hair was tousled. 

“More or less,” he answered. 
“What do you want?” 

“I have to ask you something. 
After — after Carlton, were you and 
your Glenna happy together?” 

He thought about it. “Yes, I 
think we were.” 

“You were able to forgive her? 
You didn’t resent what had 
happened?” 

“Of course I resented it — at 
first. Then I accepted it, and after 
that it didn’t count any more either 
way — it was over and done with. 
But why do you ask? What differ- 
ence does it make?” 

“I couldn’t sleep last night for 
thinking. My Woody — he was 
kind, like you, but not easily for- 
giving — I don't think he could have 
done what you did. That may be 
why I — didn’t , after all — you see? 
For I might have lost him. Do you 
understand?” 

“No, Glenna. I don’t think I do. 
What do you mean?” 

“I mean, come home. Woody! 
You were right — we’re the best 
Woody and Glenna we can find. 
Maybe an improvement on the 
originals. We can try, anyway!” 
At first he couldn’t 
breathe — and then he could. “Yes, 
Glenna. I may be a little late for 



dinner, but I’ll surely be there.” 

Her smiling lips quivered. “I can 
wait,” she said and on the screen 
the picture died. 

For a moment he stood still, his 
mind worlds away. His own 
Glenna — there had never been any 
real chance of his finding his way 
back to her, but this decision made 
the separation final. So she was 
widowed. But this Glenna had sur- 
vived widowhood. 

How many worlds? How many 
Woody s and Gleonas — some with 
the right mates, some with the 
wrong? Some with none and maybe 
some Avith two. But for him and 
her, here — he shook his head and 
came back to one framework of 
time and space. 

The blonde looked quizzically at 
him, but Pearsall merely winked at 
her as he left. In the conference 
room a discussion was under way* 
Unceremoniously, he cut into it. 

“Excuse- me, Admiral,” he said. 
“Your displaced-persons ros- 
ter — you’ll' have to cut it back to 
sixteen.” Forgues’ raised eyebrows 
wavered between surprise and an- 
noyance at the interruption — then 
he grinned. Pearsall smiled back. 

“I’ll be glad to help initiate the 
courier program, sir,” he said, “but 
I’m afraid I can’t ride in it. I’m 
taking no, chances of losing this 
world of yours. I seem to have 
found a home here.” • 



PEARSALL'S RETURN 



41 





Sure , the Eater was always 
hungry. But so were the 
poor things it devoured! 



STEPHEN TALL 

















I 

T HE call came to Red Spine 
and to the others of his shelter 
cluster as they rested deep in the 
cool corridors, insulated by many 
thicknesses of sand and soil from 
the harsh radiation of the blazing 
sun. It was the normal time of re- 
pose. But the call came and Red 
Spine and his fellows responded. 
Help was needed, help to save life. 
And life was sacred. 

“The information is not good,” 
Red Spine projected. “Great 
masses of rock have closed the 
portals and smashed the corridors. 



Many have ceased to live.” Red 
Spine spoke from his mind, from 
his thought centers. Since his pro- 
jection was open, it was detected 
by the many canceroids that 
formed the long line of slowly 
spinning beings that stretched out 
across the shimmering desert. 

“It has always been a poor lo- 
cation for a shelter cluster,” Yel- 
low Stripe said. “The Scaling 
Hills have not been called the Scal- 
ing Hills for nothing.” 

“The mountains shook.” Purple 
Fringe’s thought pulse came from 
far up near the head of the column. 
“This has not happened for many 



43 




molts. There are projections of 
many beings in pain. 1 fear that 
there will be much food for the 
Eater.” 

“It, at least, will welcome 
tragedy,” Red Spine murmured. 
“To satisfy it becomes ever 
harder. Sometimes I wonder — ” 
he left the thought unfinished. 

There was no response up and 
down the moving line. He knew 
that all had detected and had re- 
sponded, but their thoughts were 
shielded. It was always so when 
anyone spoke of the Eater. 

In his life span Red Spine had 
never seen so much death. Can- 
ceroids from shelter clusters all 
along the desert’s edge toiled to- 
gether to remove the rock, to dig 
under the great slabs that could 
not be moved, a cold, steady, pas- 
sionless effort to free the un- 
fortunate victims of the shaking 
land. Yellow Stripe had observed 
truly. It had not been a good place 
for a shelter cluster. 

As the smashed bodies were re- 
moved, often piecemeal, they 
were laid aside neatly, in tidy 
piles. The piles, in turn, were 
steadily diminished by those who 
had elected to serve as bearers. 
Each individual did what seemed 
most to need doing, so there was 
order, though no being directed. 
Thus another line wound back 
across the desert toward the high- 



peaked, disklike hill in the dis- 
tance that was not a hill at all. 

There was communication. 
Meaningful patterns pulsed from 
thought center to thought center. 
Such was conversation as can- 
ceroids knew it, soundless, con- 
cise. And in every reception cen- 
ter another projection throbbed 
and hummed, dully, monotonous- 
ly. None answered it. It could not 
be answered by speech. It could 
only be interrupted or stilled by 
the carriers of the pieces of broken 
bodies. 

“Food! Food! Food!” 

The irritating, endless projec- 
tion of the Eater was a part of can- 
ceroid life. None could remember 
when it had not been there.. To feed 
the Eater was a responsibility of 
every canceroid. None contested 
it. None challenged it. It had al- 
ways been so. 

ED SPINE moved rock. His 
peaked carapace, a sturdy disk 
ten feet in diameter, thick and re- 
sistant, was balanced on sixteen 
pairs of armored walking ap- 
pendages. His cold stalked eyes 
peered from under heavy chitinous 
sheaths. He enjdyed his strength. 

Others dug sand. Still others 
carefully moved the living bodies 
as they were freed. If there was no 
vital hurt these would be removed 
to the corridors and repose cham- 



44 



IF 




bers of other shelter clusters. 
There they would sit and be fed by 
their hosts until they had 
regenerated all that had been in- 
jured or lost. The ruined shelter 
cluster would be dug and built 
again, with symbionts donated 
from other communities, but 
next time it would not be located 
where the mountains could fall on 
it. 

Cleanly, neatly, every scrap of 
broken body, every cast append- 
age, even the fragments of shat- 
tered carapaces were gathered up. 
All went to feed the Eater. There 
could be no wasting of biomass. 
It was becoming precious. But this 
time, at least, it was abundant. The 
Eater had bodies and more bodies, 
as many as even its capacious gut 
could welcome and digest. And 
after two days the telepathic 
mumble of its incessant food call 
slowly subsided and became still. 

“The Eater is satisfied,” Blue 
Dot projected. “I do not ever 
remember this happing before. 
This is good.” 

“I am from an 1 earlier hatching 
than you,” Red Spine said. “I re- 
member an earlier time. And it is 
not good.” 

“How can it not be good? The 
flesh is dead. Only life is sacred. If 
the Eater is filled, we do not have 
to feed it. To me, that is very 
good.” 



“Watch. If I am wrong, I will 
correct my statement. When the 
Eater calls for food again, life will 
be harder. Watch.” 

With all the food, the vast 
mound that was the Eater became 
torpid. In the memory of the 
oldest canceroid it had never 
walked, for its nourishment was 
supplied -at its mouth opening and 
its wastes were removed from be- 
hind it. But now, under its thick 
and radiation-scarred carapace, 
on which lichens and sponge 
masses grew tall and dense, 
changes were taking place. Its in- 
credible expanses of tissue filled 
with fluids — it writhed and shifted 
for half a day. Then the whole 
great skeleton ripped asunder. A 
red, pulsing, monstrous thing 
crept feebly from it, pulling limp 
appendages from the rigid 
cylinders that had protected them. 
It dragged itself clear of the vast 
skeleton, inching, almost flow- 
ing along, then lay inert, cringing 
and shuddering in the hard radia- 
tion of the brilliant light of day. 

But this was something that 
happened. To the monstrosity it 
was normal. It was a creature of 
the radiation and could tolerate it. 
It did not die. 



S LOWLY a new carapace 
formed over the acres of shift-

ing, rippling flesh, thickening and 
darkening, becoming more and 
more the color of the expanse of 
sand around it. Its appendanges 
stiffened as armor sheathed them. 
Around the great dome of its body 
they then reached outward, grop- 
ing, huge pincers clashing. 

They found what they searched 
for. The discarded skeleton, a 
great split crumpled mass, was 
seized and slowly dragged to 
where the creature’s staring 
stalked eyes could study it. Mas- 
sive chelae pulled it to the mouth 
opening, wide palps savored it 
and for hours the splintering 
crunch of its mandibles sounded as 
it devoured its previous covering 
to the last morsel. 

Then it settled itself ponder- 
ously into the sand, drawing in 
the many pairs oT appendages and 
burying them deep. The carapace 
had finished its hardening. Ridges 
ran from its edge to the high peak 
of its center, like rain furrows 
from the top of a cone-shaped hill. 
Its eyestalks drew back under 
their heavy protective overhangs. 
It sat, quiescent, thirty thousand 
times the size of any canceroid 
that fed it. It could have been 
carved from the stone of the near- 
by hills. No watcher would have 
suspected it to be alive. The sponge 
clusters and crust-like life forms in- 
vaded and began to grow again, 



camouflaging the new carapace. 

The Eater lay in a deep stupor, 
maturing its tissues, consolidat- 
ing the increase in size that came 
with every shedding. When the 
outcry, which was not sound and 
which only a canceroid could de- 
tect, began again, it would be 
stronger, more insistent than ever 
before. 

“The Eater has molted and now 
it does not call for food.” Knobbed 
Claw exuded pleasure. “This is a 
marvelous thing. Perhaps it will 
not need to eat again for many 
starshines.” 

His pulse of relief was re- 
inforced from many thought cen- 
ters and Red Spine, who knew bet- 
ter, shielded what was in his mind. 
They would know soon enough. 

And all this happened only 
days before the Invader ship 
came in. 

T T CAME gently, slowly, quiet- 
* ly, an enormous glittering cyl- 
inder, featureless, having no 
openings and no appendages. 
There was nothing to show why it 
should fly through the light at- 
mosphere of Cancerol as though it 
were a flutterby. x But fly it did 
without effort, cruising low over 
the wide stretches of open country, 
swinging with silent ease over the 
piled masses of the Scaling Hills. 



46 



IF 




Red Spine watched it. Flattened 
in the sand, his appendages drawn 
under him, his eyestalks ex- 
truded, he stared with a cold intelli- 
gent wonder. For Red Spine had 
speculated on things such as this. 
But his speculations had never 
included such size, such implica- 
tions of advanced competence. 
He had no' basis for the concept of 
a ship. On Cancerol all beings 
were their own transportation. 
So he thought that the Invader 
ship was a living thing and down in 
his cold consciousness a fear be- 
gan and grew. 

“If it must feed,” he thought, “it 
will require living things. When 
we feed ourselves and keep the 
Eater satisfied, not much re- 
mains. Therefore it will eat — us!” 

Canceroids were not prone to 
panic, but Red Spine felt un- 
accustomed agitation when the 
strange object finally drifted 
down. It came to rest on the stretch 
of open sand where the members 
of Red Spine’s shelter cluster al- 
ways played at pebble tag. Only a 
few minutes’ journey away, slop- 
ing under the nearest hill, was the 
wide, low main entrance of the 
shelter. 

As it happened, not many mem- 
bers of the cluster were abroad 
when the great cylinder touched 
down. It was the time of rest. Most 
were in repose in the cool dark 



chambers of the shelter. When the 
sun Cancer was hidden, when the 
radiation dropped, this was their 
normal time of activity. They 
could tolerate the savage sunshine, 
but they did not require it. The 
day was the time of the sponge 
masses, the green and red and yel- 
low producer beings that dotted 
the sandy plains and clung even to 
the raw faces of the vertical cliffs. 
They reveled in the sun. While it 
shone they grew, sucking mois- 
ture from the dry air and from deep 
in the soil, building succulent 
masses of tissue that formed the 
food base of the planet. Not only 
the canceroids, but a wealth of 
other life preyed on and con- 
tinually pruned the ever-growing 
mounds. 

More often than most of his fel- 
lows Red Spine prowled in the 
bright radiation. He was con- 
cerned with the speed at which the 
sponge beings grew, with the 
amount of food for canceroids 
that they produced. He watched 
the other forms that fed on the 
sponges. These, too, could be eaten 
by canceroids, but only the body 
parts that could be regenerated. 
On Cancerol there was one law 
and all things respected it. Life 
must not be destroyed. 

So Red Spine watched the in- 
vader land. He was appalled by its 
bigness and deeply concerned 



THE INVADERS 



47 




that it might not respect the law. 
For how could it know? Why 
should it care? It was an unbe- 
lievable shape and greater in length 
even than the Eater, which lay like 
a cone-shaped hill a short run 
away. 

Red Spine settled deeper into 
the sand, his stalked eyes glittering 
like brilliants. And a strange thing 
happened. 

A hole opened in the side of the 
Invader. Out of the hole small be- 
ings swarmed, beings unlike any- 
thing ever seen on Cancerol. They 
were white, shiny white, bouncing 
back the sunlight. They had 
appendages, but only two pairs, 
placed at opposite ends of the long 
bodies. One pair they used for lo- 
comotion, the other they waved 
about in random patterns, or used 
to hold what seemed to be arti- 
facts. A large round head sat atop 
the body column. One glistening 
eye covered half the head, and al- 
ways faced in the direction of the 
creature’s locomotion. 

Red Spine understood. It was a 
hard thing to grasp, but he dealt 
with facts, and there was no doubt- 
ing the evidence of his eyes. The 
Invader was an artifact. It was a 
made thing. Presumably the be- 
ings spewing out of it had made it, 
used it for shelter and locomo- 
tion, used it to bring them out from 
the blue mystery of space. 



Red Spine was well camou- 
flaged. The rippling colors that 
could flow along his carapace 
ridges were extinguished. His 
appendages were buried. He could 
have been simply a symmetrical 
boulder lying among the stones 
that were scattered everywhere. 
But they found him quickly and 
unerringly. 

II 

T HEY surrounded him, teeter- 
ing on their single pairs of 
walking appendages. They held 
out small objects with their hold- 
ing chelae. And they communi- 
cated continually — by sound! 
Primitive. Still, Red Spine knew 
that these beings were not primi- 
tive. They were different. And 
probably they were danger. How, 
in what fashion, he did not know. 
His thought centers grappled cold- 
ly with the problem. And prompt- 
ly he decided what he would do. 

The ring of white figures 
widened when he rose slowly and 
majestically from the sand, stand- 
ing high on his sixteen pairs of 
appendages. Every spine that 
stippled his high-crowned cara- 
pace, far greater in diameter than 
the height of the tallest alien, 
glowed with a ruby light. He ex- 
truded his eyes to the extreme

IF 




length of their stalks, folded his 
palps decorously over his mouth 
opening. Then, with dignity, he 
flashed the peace sign with his cold 
light. 

The beings teetered backward 
swiftly and a babble of sound 
came from them. They held out 
long objects in their holding 
chelae, cylinders with the ends 
pointing at him. The high sharp 
noises were not intelligible, but 
their meaning was plain, just the 
same. They were fear noises. 
Somehow, they had misunder- 
stood the signs of friendship. The 
cylinders were menace. 

Red Spine was incapable of 
sound. He could communicate 
only with the awareness waves of 
his kind and with these beings he 
felt that they would be useless. 

Still he tried. 

“Do not panic,” he projected. 
“We are different, but that is no 
cause for fear.” And because 
courtesy required it he again 
flashed the peace sign. 

The sounds how came from one 
being, while the others held out 
the cylinders. 

“Easy does it,” the being said. 
“No radiation in that flash. It’s as 
cold as firefly light. That thing is 
saying something.” 

“Yeah,” another vocalized. 
“Get off my world or I’ll blast you! 
That’s what it’s saying.” 



There was rumbling sound from 
the first being. 

“Good old Pegleg! Your faith, 
as usual, is touching. Look at it! If 
it had a tail, it would be wagging it. 
There’s no menace there.” 

A third being, a smaller than 
the rest, made a higher, shriller 
sound, most unpleasant to Red 
Spine’s receptors. Yet in spite of 
this he could sense the friendliness 
in it. 

“I agree, Roscoe. It means no 
harm. It may even be frightened: It 
must have seen us land.” 

Again the rumbling sound from 
the first being. 

“That could have brightened up 
its day. Let’s back away and see 
what it’ll do. If it’s really aware 
it’ll think^ef something.” 

“Do you mind,” said the other 
maker of deep sounds, “if I keep 
my laser pointed in its general 
direction? Just in case what it 
thinks of isn’t what you had in 
mind?” 

“If there were danger I’d feel it,” 
the high sound said. “There!” And 
it placed the cylinder it had been 
holding into a slit in its carapace. 

“Grandstanding,” the ^ deep 
sound grumbled. “Lindy, little 
friend of the galaxy. You only 
have to be wrong once, you know.” 

The sounds receded as the be- 
ings teetered backward on those 
single pairs of appendanges, al- 



THE INVADERS

ways keeping the large eye toward 
him. Red Spine felt a sudden 
twinge of pity as he watched. Such 
flimsy, unstable creatures! But 
then he turned his stalked eyes 
toward the huge artifact that had 
brought them there and his pity 
died. These were advanced be- 
ings. Whence they had come, how 
they moved through, space, why 
they were here — no canceroid 
could imagine. The sounds that 
they made were varied and Red 
Spine knew that they were com- 
plex speech. He had recorded 
them all in his memory tissues, so 
that later, in a thought period, he 
could bring them back and analyse 
their components, searching for 
keys that would reveal their mean- 
ings. 

The beings continued to move 
away, so Red Spine flexed his 
many pairs of walking append- 
ages and began to rotate slowly, 
first in place, then drifting across 
the sand like a great spinning top. 
The invaders became small white 
dots in the distance. The can- 
ceroid had but one thought sudden- 
ly — to get back to the shelter 
cluster and tell this strange tale. He 
felt sure that he was being 
watched, so he took a long and de- 
vious route, zig-zagging among 
the boulders, and finally spinning 
around the mighty cone-shaped 
mass that was the Eater. With its 



bulk between him and the distant 
beings he sped for the shelter 
opening like a desert dust-devil. 

O THERS had seen the alien 
carrier come to ground. Half a 
dozen elders, the largest and at 
times the most brightly colored of 
the cluster, sat inert on 
prominences, their stalked eyes 
fixed on the long cylinder of the 
distant artifact. 

“We feared you were de- 
stroyed.” one projected. It was 
Right Twist. Red Spine respected 
him. Right Twist was old and 
learned. 

“The creature came out of 
space,” Right Twist continued. 
“We saw it come. It had many 
pairs of stalked eyes and its mouth 
opening glowed red. No doubt it 
has come to feed on us.” 

“Your vision is better than 
mine,” Red Spine thought 
courteously. “I was quite closer 
and I did not see these things. But 
it settled near me and I learned.” 
“What did you learn?” Yellow 
Stripe showed no color now. His 
carapace was sand gray, as were 
the others. 

“I learned,” Red Spine pro- 
jected, “that it is not a creature at 
all. It requires no food. It is an 
artifact.” 

He could sense the polite disbe- 
lief from half a dozen thought cen- 



50 



IF 




teFS. For a brief time span there 
was no other communication. 

Then Right Twist projected 
gravely: “There are facts to sup- 
port this statement?” 

“There are facts,” Red Spine 
acknowledged. “The thing is a car- 
rier of many small beings. An 
opening formed in it and a num- 
ber of them came out and walked 
on the sand. They have white cara- 
paces and one great eye. They lo- 
comote on a single pair of append- 
ages. And,” he paused, for the 
point was an impressive one, 
“they communicate entirely by 
sound.” 

“Primitives!” The pulse burst 
from Yellow Stripe. 

“This is unlikely.” The pro- 
jection came from Blue Dot, who 
occupied the highest prominence. 
“To build and use a carrier such as 
this is not primitive.” 

They all sat. An aura of puzzle- 
ment and frustration seemed to 
hang in the air, but to have no par- 
ticular origin. They all contributed 
to it. 

“You accept Red Spine’s facts?” 
Right Twist thought at Blue Dot. 

“My vision is good,” Blue Dot 
said, “and I sit above you. There 
are small bits of white about the^ 
thing and they are moving.” 

“Their eye is very large,” Red 
Spine said. “It may be that they al- 
so see us.” 



“We have no ways of measuring 
what they can do,” Right Twist de- 
cided. “They are alien. Whence 
they came we cannot imagine. 
Why they are here we cannot even 
speculate. Our rules will not apply 
to them. We can only watch.” 

“And be watched,” Blue Dot 
thought drily. 

“And hope.” Yellow Stripe’s 
fear throbbed in his projection. 
From the very egg he had been 
timid. 

“When the sun is gone,” Red 
Spine thought, “when the radia- 
tion drops and the only light is 
starshine, we can look closely at 
the artifact. The aliens will be in- 
side. It is likely that they come out 
only in the day.” 

“But not certain,” Right Twist 
cautioned. “We must use cau- 
tion.” 

“They were very near me and 
examined me carefully and I 
came to no harm. And when I rose 
and flashed the peace sign, they 
showed fear. They pointed cylin- 
ders at me and walked away back- 
ward, the large eyes always on me. 
And the sounds seemed dis- 
turbed. ” 

“Nevertheless, we will wait,” 
Right Twist decreed. “I agree that 
the time of starshine is best. We 
will go then.” 

While he had no power to make 
decisions, because of his age he 



THE INVADERS 



51 




was respected. They waited. The 
intelligence of the landing of the 
strange carrier was projected in- 
to the shelter opening, where it 
was passed from thought center to 
thought center by hundreds of 
canceroids in dozens of chambers 
and corridors and repose 
cubicles. Each being sat quietly 
wherever it received the news. 
There was no rush to the shelter 
opening or to emergency exits to 
see for themselves. There was 
nothing more to^ be done or 
learned until starshine. So they 
waited. 

A ND as they waited it began 
again. Whether the unusual 
mental activity of the canceroids 
disturbed it or whether simply the 
renewed peristalsis of its vast 
gut — empty after the rigors of 
molt and new skeleton forma- 
tion — roused The Eater mattered 
not. What did matter was that 
when he sulky, petulant rumble 
began, it must be fed. 

“Food! Food! Food!” 

Each canceroid understood, 
with an almost inherited wis- 
dom, that the Eater should not 
move. Red Spine had wondered in 
moments of meditation if it 
could move for any great distance, 
after all the eons of remaining in 
that one location among the 
boulders on the hot sandy plain. 



Even its wastes were removed 
from behind it. Canceroids car- 
ried them far and wide, burying 
them under the sand. And at these 
spots the sponge clusters grew with 
unusual vigor and provided more 
and better cuttings of food pieces. 

Still, the Eater did move — if on- 
ly a little way — as it flowed out of 
its armor at each molt. These hap- 
pened rarely. Red Spine could re- 
call but two in his life span. They 
occured just after the creature 
had had great masses of food. On- 
ly some great destruction of life, 
such as the fall of rock just past, 
could provide enough . 

“Food! Food! Food!” 

The mindless pulses became 
stronger, clearer. The Eater’s pa- 
tience was not great. 

Right Twist flashed a call into 
the shelter cluster. When the first 
canceroid emerged, he himself led 
the way out to where the sponge 
clusters were best developed. Oth- 
er shelter clusters, each in its tradi- 
tional turn, would be sending out 
food gatherers to placate the 
Eater’s endless hunger. There was 
no resentment. It had always 
been thus. Only Red Spine won- 
dered, deep in his contemplation 
centers, if this should be. 

-“The Eater will require more 
food than ever before,” Blue Dot 
projected. “Some of it must come 
from very far away.” 



52 



IF 




“I wonder,” Red Spine thought, 
“if all the canceroids from all the 
shelter clusters can provide 
enough. The sponge bodies are 
pruned as closely as we dare. We 
bring to it all dead bodies of all be- 
ings, however small. And still it 
cries.” 

“We must give it more,” Blue 
Dot said. 

“There isn’t more. Our own food 
needs must be remembered. The 
symbionts of the shelter clusters 
must eat. The little beings that 
live under rocks, the flutterbys of 
the air, all must feed. Life cannot 
be destroyed even for the Eater.” 

“Then,” Blue Dot said, “perhaps 
the Eater will go searching for its 
own nourishment. It does not 
know that life must not be de- 
stroyed. If we do not feed it, it will 
devour anything in its path. It will 
leave nothing of the sponge be- 
ings to r^enerate. It will tear apart 
the shelter clusters. It will feed 
on — us.” 

“And then, having destroyed 
all the food, it will die,” Red Spine 
said. “There is no benefit here for 
anything. All life will be de- 
stroyed to no purpose. Cancerol, 
the home world, will have no in- 
habitants.” 

Blue Dot swiveled his stalked 
eyes toward the long cylinder of 
the alien carrier, far across the 
desert. 



“Others will come;” he pro- 
phesied. “There is proof, that car- 
rier out there. Beings from space 
will take the world that has been 
ours since the beginning.” 



"O ED SPINE shifted his many 
appendages restlessly. This 
talk disturbed him. Something 
was wrong here. His sense of jus- 
tice was offended. It was legend 
that the Eater had always been 
there, slowly growing bigger, 
and that canceroids had always 
fed it. But why? What did it contri- 
bute? Its wastes were not enough. 
Without it there would be food in 
plenty. There would be time for 
thought, for contemplation. With 
it, extinction threatened. 

“I sense your thoughts,” Blue 
Dot projected. “You should shield 
them. They are not worthy of you.” 

Red Spine said, “All sides of a 
problem should be considered. 
Even this one. Why should we feed 
the Eater?” 

“It has always been done.” 

“That is not enough. For every- 
thing else there must be a reason. 
Why must I not challenge this?” 

“No one ever has,” said Blue 
Dot. 

“And so we must die. Is this 
reasonable? Do you deny my right 
to question?” 

The bright blue spots of Blue

Dot’s carapace slowly faded un- 
til he was again the color of the 
rocks around. He withdrew his 
eyestalks into their sockets. Ner- 
vously his appendages tossed a 
pebble back and forth. 

“You disturb me. Such 
thoughts have always been buried 
deep and have never been un- 
shielded. But you have the right to 
question.” 

Red Spine felt satisfaction. 
“Do we know that the Eater can 
move and destroy all life? It never 
has. Why may it not use more 
energy in moving than it gets from 
the food it finds? Then it will grow 
weaker, find less food.” 

“And finally die,” Blue Dot 
finished. “That is not defensible. 
Life cannot be destroyed.” 

“It is defensible. All living be- 
ings must feed themselves. If they 
do not they die.” 

“The Eater is different. It has 
never fed itself.” 

“And now,” Red Spine pro- 
jected boldly, “I wonder why. 
You have admitted my right to 
question and you cannot tell me 
why.” 

Doubt and dismay swirled 
around the big canceroids as they 
sat unmoving on the prominences. 
Yellow Stripe and Purple Fringe 
and Plain Shell and Knobbed Claw 
and Blue Dot were completely 
without their distinguishing color 



patterns. Even a good eye could 
scarcely have told one from an- 
other. 

But Red Spine had never been 
brighter. The tip of every spine 
sparkled crimson. The six eyes at 
the ends of their extended stalks 
glinted pale crystalline blue. He 
raised and lowered his glowing 
body disk, half spinning as the 
appendages shifted. An idea that 
had been buried deep in his con- 
sciousness since his growing 
molts had finally emerged. It was 
heresy, but it was reasonable. 
That the Eater was given the food 
that should have been the right of 
all living things everyone knew. 
But the thought had never been 
allowed to surface. It had never 
been expressed before. 

Red Spine was stimulated, 
elated. 

“I may die,” he projected, “but 
I will not be the cause. I will no 
longer take food to the Eater.” 

“But — ” the soundless pulse 
burst from five thought cen- 
ters — “it must be fed!” 

“Why?” 

“We are repeating,” Blue Dot 
said. “We cannot insure that you 
will feed the Eater. But we can re- 
move your appendages, to give 
you time to reflect while they re- 
generate: This has been done.” 

“True,” Red Spine mused, “but 
I do not agree that this is required. 



54 



IF 




Therefore, I will resist. And if I 
do, you will lose appendages as 
well.” 

“But no one has ever resisted!” 
Yellow Stripe’s thought pulse 
quavered. 

“True. And no one ever before 
decided not to feed the Eater. I 
have long felt that this is just. I al- 
so feel that it would be reasonable 
to protect my appendages.” 

“You have the right to believe 
this,” Blue Dot said reluctantly. 
“We will wait for the wisdom of 
Right Twist.” 

Red Spine rocked on his append- 
ages. 

“He also is fallible,” he stated. 
“When the alien carrier came 
down he saw on it appendages and 
many stalked eyes. Now I was near 
it, on the sand, and it had none of 
those things. It was his fear that 
saw.” 

Stalk'ed eyes emerged again 
from carapace sheaths. For a brief 
while they had forgotten the 
aliens. The insistent food call' of 
the Eater had subsided into a 
sulky murmur, so they knew that 
food was being piled before it. 
While it ate the hunger pulses grew 
less. 

Ill 

T HE sun had set. Overhead the 
stars grew steadily brighter, a 



black canopy stippled with sweeps 
and swirls of yellow points. The 
time of starshine was beginning. 
The radiation had receded. It was 
the pleasant time. 

“The small white beings will go 
back into the carrier,” Red Spine 
said quietly. This will be the time 
to look closely at the artifact.” 

“I must feed the Eater,” Blue 
Dot said hastily. “It is my turn.” 
“And mine! And mine! And 
mine!” 

“I am free,” Yellow Stripe ad- 
mitted. “I will go, but not too near. 
We should not frighten them — if 
they are small, as you say.” 

“I will go also,” a thought 
pulsed ffom distance. “It may be 
that I did not see eyes and append- 
ages. If there are none, I will cor- 
rect my statement.” 

“We will meet you,” Red Spine 
projected. “Then we can agree on 
what is there.” 

It was the first of many visits. 
The canceroids approached the 
great ship carefully at first, but on 
succeeding nights — in succeed- 
ing times of starshine — they 
gradually grew bolder. They paced 
the distance from end to end of the 
ship, a distance greater than the 
longest corridor in the largest 
shelter cluster. They marveled at 
the smooth curving sides of the 
huge cylinder. In those glistening 
walls, openings could appear, 



THE INVADERS 



55 




sometimes small, to allow the be- 
ings to come through, sometimes 
so large that gleaming, pointed 
artifacts were spat from them, to 
cruise far and wide in the air over 
the deserts and mountains and 
finally return and be received in- 
to the openings again. 

One thing was discovered 
early. The beings were not con- 
fined to the sunshine. Like the 
canceroids, they soon realized 
that the night was the better time. 
And, added marvel, when they 
came out into the starshine they 
were different. What appeared to 
be a carapace was not a part of the 
beings at all. When the sun was 
gone they emerged pliant and 
slender, the great eye replaced by 
two tiny ones and a mouth orifice 
studded with small white stones in 
rows. The false carapace was 
simply a shielding structure 
against the radiation and was 
readily removed. 

By sunlight and by starshine, 
Red Spine watched. Almost al- 
ways he was near the carrier, im- 
pressing every wonder onto his 
memory tissues. Since he no longer 
fed the Eater, he had time. And 
soon he was deeply disturbed at 
what the aliens did. 

They looked closely at all life. 
Nothing escaped their attention. 
They had strange means of loco- 
motion, leaping far across the 



desert at a single bound, or rolling 
along in a device into which sev- 
eral of the beings fitted. To Red 
Spine these things were merely 
curios. But the beings’ lack of re- 
gard for the right of all beings to 
live was quite another thing. 

To take a portion of an 
organism for food was proper and 
necessary. But even in direst situa- 
tion enough of the being must be 
left to regenerate. Otherwise life 
would not continue. 

This basic understanding was 
completely ignored by the aliens. 
They took entire individuals and 
placed them in confinement- and 
would not allow them the freedom 
of movement that had always 
been the right of all things. In rows 
and rows of enclosures they im- 
prisoned beings both large and 
small. They climbed the hills, lifted 
the rocks, dug under the sand. 
Even flutterbys beat their flying 
appendages helplessly against 
cleverly woven wall meshes of 
bright metal. 

R ED SPINE communicated 
what he saw. The ehders of the 
shelter cluster sat* long in rapport, 
discussing what was known. As 
always they listened to Right 
Twist, because greater age gave 
greater wisdom. 

And Right Twist, after much 
meditation, finally offered his 



56 



IF 




conclusion. He spoke first to Red 
Spine, as they lingered near the 
carrier in bright starshine. 

“These creatures, no matter 
how advanced, have brought to 
the homeworld an ancient bar- 
barism. They destroy. Therefore 
they must themselves be de- 
stroyed.” 

“A life for a life solves noth- 
ing.” Red Spine took philosophi- 
cal opposition. “First it must be 
understood why they do these 
things. They must be prevailed on 
to desist.” 

“Why?” Right Twist ques- 
tioned. “Will this release the 
forms they have imprisoned? Will 
it bring back those they have de- 
stroyed? Will it prevent them from 
destroying more? We have specu- 
lated on life from the stars, but who 
could have imagined that it would 
have primitive, exterminative 
ethics?” 

“Perhaps they are not really 
alive,” Red Spine speculated. “In 
many ways they seem artificial. 
They could be merely devices, 
controlled by the Ultimate Wis- 
dom from unimaginable space. 
They could have been sent to test 
the strength of our convictions, 
the consistency of our beliefs in 
the sacredness of life.” 

Right Twist picked up a pebble, 
passed it from appendage to 
appendage around the entire 



circle of his carapace, a swift, facile 
gesture of irritation. 

“They are alive,” he projected. 
“Their metabolism involves food 
and energy release and excre- 
tion. They are affected by the 
radiation. Note how quickly they 
have adjusted to the starshine 
cycle. Their carapaces are arti- 
ficial. But they are alive.” 

Red Spine knew this. He simply 
made use of the practices of de- 
bate while he thought. It was 
ethically necessary to refute an 
idea before a discussion could 
progress. Red Spine was a 
true fundamentalist in his think- 
ing and to destroy an organism 
totally was, admittedly, not de- 
fensible. But Right Twist, from an- 
other view, was showing alarm- 
ing signs of instability. Perhaps 
he should be deprived of all his 
appendages, to give him time to 
reflect and to become more ra- 
tional while they regenerated. This 
was a mere passing thought pulse, 
shielded deep in his contempla- 
tive centers, and while Right Twist 
could not detect it, he probably 
shrewdly speculated that it was 
there. 

“I propose that we approach 
them directly,” Red Spine 
thought, in his dulcet frequencies. 
“We cannot judge them by their 
actions. We must know their mo- 
tivation.'’ 



THE INVADERS 



57 




“I do not care to be collected,” 
Right Twist thought drily. “I have 
no intention of having my move- 
ments restricted by an enclosure. 
These are alien, savage life forms. 
Undoubtedly they are searching 
for a life space. Ours is the ideal 
planet. They will take it unless we 
prevent them — and in the taking 
destroy us all.” 

Red Spine was becoming more 
than disturbed. He was appalled. 
He had not realized the extent of 
Right Twists’s thought deviation. 
It was he who was the primitive, 
savage form. To suspect the aliens 
of needing a life space was a 
proposition not worthy of a larva. 
Obviously their technology was 
almost unbelievably advanced. 
It would be far more reasonable to 
meet them as equals, welcome 
them as guests, touch their strange 
centers in friendship. 

“Compared to them,” Red 
Spine offered, “we are large. They 
would not try to dismember or 
imprison us. They will treat us 
with respect.” 

“They control enormous 
energies,” retorted Right Twist. 
“Size is meaningless. I propose 
that we take one when it strays 
from its group, remove its append- 
ages and observe how it re- 
generates. This should provide 
some clue as to their possible po- 
tential to harm us.” 



T HE sharp projections along 
the radiating lines of Red 
Spine’s carapace glowed a 
brighter, a faintly pulsating scar- 
let. His six stalked eyes glistened 
like blue jade. 

“Unwise,” he projected. 
“These beings are connected by a 
communications net. Injure one 
and the others will know. Furth- 
er, I feel sure that they do not re- 
generate. Of the many from the 
carrier, not one lacks an append- 
age from the two pairs that are all 
they seem to have.” 

“Then how do they feed? Can it 
be that they consume entire 
bodies and use their gonads alone 
to produce more? Disgusting!” 
“They are merely different,” 
Red Spine thought soothingly. 
“Consider that they came from 
the depths of space. They are both 
a challenge and an opportunity. 
Not, I think, a menace.” 

Red Spine himself was actually 
more disturbed by the invaders 
than he., wished Right Twist to 
know. They exhibited, indeed, a 
frightenjng adaptability. In a 
space of ten rotations of the 
planet, of the glorious homeworld 
Cancerol, the Center of the Uni- 
verse, they had shown quick un- 
derstanding of how living things 
were fitted to conditions and dis- 
tributed as to space. These beings 
also, knew untold things that a 



58 



IF 




canceroid could only suspect. 
They had come from space. They 
knew what was out there. 

Suddenly Red Spine felt the 
need for meditation, for solitude. 
He turned his disk slowly, flashed 
the peace sign with his cold light 
and went spinning away across the 
sand toward the shelter cluster. He 
enjoyed the exercise, enjoyed the 
exhilaration of the flexing 
muscles in his sixteen sets of 
appendages. Out of sheer well-be- 
ing he spun faster and faster, leav-^ 
ing a blurred, looping trail across 
the sand. 

Right Twist followed him, but 
more slowly, scuttling along in a 
straight line, his stalked eyes 
directed back at the great space 
vessel of the aliens. 

Red Spine felt amusement. 
Right Twist now had no friendship 
for the creatures, but there was in 
him a healthy respect for what they 
might do. He was not disposed to 
remain near their ship alone. 

D AY followed day. The elders 
of the shelter cluster stabilized 
their attitudes toward the aliens, 
but they kept their thoughts 
shielded. There was not the rap- 
port that had always existed be- 
fore, for the points of view were too 
far apart. Red Spine communi- 
cated and soothed and counseled 
friendship whenever he felt a 



* 

mind open to him. This was not of- 
ten. But he was aware of the feel- 
ings of most and worked quietly to 
modify them. 

Yellow Stripe, he knew, feared 
the invaders, as he always feared 
any unknown thing. He felt sure 
that Right Twist was plotting, 
deep in his own consciousness, to 
conduct his regeneration ex- 
periment if ever he could lay 
holding appendages on a speci- 
men. Blue Dot remained aloof, 
coldly watching while the aliens 
went about their taboo-breaking, 
blasphemous activities. And 
Red Spine himself kept his stalked 
eyes on them all. 

He felt satisfaction that the 
aliens had made no attempt to im- 
prison a canceroid. Instead, 
they also seemed to be watching, 
using recording artifacts. They 
made many sounds, waved their 
appendages in strange ways, 
emitted energies in wave-lengths 
most distressing to the cancer- 
oid nervous system. Red Spine in- 
terpreted this behavior, he felt, 
correctly. 

“It is justice,” he projected. 
“While we are studying them, they 
are beyond doubt studying us. 
They recognize the nonthinking 
forms for what they are. Us they 
treat differently.” 

“We are large,” Yellow Stripe 
said fearfuly. He kept his ener- 



THE INVADERS 



59 




gy pulses to lowest intensity, so 
that his thoughts were hard to de- 
tect. “Only our size prevents 
them from destroying us.” 

“I feel that this has little ef- 
fect,” Red Spine thought. “They 
have energies we could never 
counter. Instead, it seems likely 
that they are trying to communi- 
cate. The sounds, the waving ap- 
pendages, all indicate this. It is 
in this fashion that they commu- 
nicate with each other.” 

“This is evidence of low intel- 
ligence level,” came from Right 
Twist. “Only primitive forms use 
sound.” 

“You are thinking with our 
measuring devices. They came 
from space, in a vessel wider and 
longer than any burrow in any 
cluster on the homeworld. This is 
not primitive. "It is very ad- 
vanced. We could not do it.” 

“We would not wish to,” Right 
Twist said stubbornly. “We have 
here the best of all possible 
worlds. Why should we leave? 
While they, having nothing to 
compare with CanceroL have 
come to wrest it from us and live 
here always.” 

It was then that Red Spine be- 
gan to realize that he had a re- 
sponsibility to sustain some- 
thing far more basic than a differ- 
ence of opinion or philosophy. 
Deep in the cold recesses of his 



thinking structures the convic- 
tion grew that these creatures, 
these invaders, with their mighty 
space vessel and unbelievable 
artifacts, mu§t not be given cause 
to become antagonistic. What 
Right Twist plotted was danger- 
ous. The senseless fears of Yellow 
Stripe might result in senseless 
behavior, actions the aliens 
would not understand. That was 
the real hazard. Lack of under- 
standing. 

For these beings did not covet 
the homeworld. They were too dif- 
ferent. The conditions that ex- 
isted on Cancerol, so satisfying 
to the radiation-resistant na- 
tive life, actually caused them 
grief. So it followed that they 
would not stay. As they came, so 
they would go. But they must not 
be challenged as long as they 
caused no deliberate harm, no 
widespread destruction. 

IV 

R ED SPINE himself had 
caused another problem, an- 
other stress in the age-old pattern 
of canceroid life: His refusal to 
feed the Eater was communi- 
cated from cluster to cluster. 
Rapport groups throughout the 
range of his kind gave it deep con- 
sideration. His own cluster de- 
bated it again and again. 



60 



IF 




“The Eater cannot move,” Blue 
Dot finally decided. “Why 
should it then eat my food? I think 
Red Spine has wisdom.” 

“Would you suggest that we, 
too, cease to feed it?” Knobbed 
Claw asked. 

“I will go further,” projected 
Blue Dot. “Henceforth I will gath- 
er only for the shelter cluster. 
Let the Eater provide for itself.” 
“Madness,” Yellow Stripe pro- 
tested. He twiddled his palps ner- 
vously. “We live the best of all 
possible lives because we have al- 
ways fed the Eater. It is the price 
we pay for our existence. If we 
stop we will certainly die.” 

“And we die if we continue. 
Food can no longer be brought fast 
enough. No — if I must die, let it 
be a new way. I bring no more 
food.” 

“This is a reasonable posi- 
tion,” Knobbed Claw said. “I will 
reflect on it.” 

It was a point of view that sud- 
denly became contagious. From 
other shelter clusters fewer and 
fewer workers streamed in with 
biomass for the endlessly hun- 
gry mountain-thing. Higher and 
ever more frantic grew its tele-/ 
pathic screams. 

“Food! Food! Food!” 

After eons of unconfused, 
peaceful living — wherein all 

things were known and predic- 



table — the homeworld was in 
turmoil. Out in the desert the in- 
vader ship lay unmoving, inert, 
but the beings that inhabited it 
scurried and hopped and walked 
and flew like an all-pervading 
plague. They were everywhere. 
And ^always the Eater’s raven- 
ous projections frazzled nerve- 
ends. 

The aliens had early discov- 
ered that the Eater was a being- 
— that it was alive. They gave it 
much attention. Red Spine could 
always find some of them near it, 
watching, making their varied 
sounds. And he was there when 
three of them climbed to the peak 
of the great carapace, drawing 
themselves up the steep slope by 
clinging to its gnarled spines and 
by bracing their appendages in 
the cracks and striations that 
seamed it. They paused to study 
the sponge clusters and the lichen 
forms which so encrusted it that it 
appeared little different from 
the distant hills. 

These three were known to Red 
Spine. He passed them often and 
when he flashed the peace sign they 
always waved their appendages 
in answer. He had seen them 
watching, probably with wonder 
and astonishment, the continu- 
al carrying of food and the re- 
moval of wastes. Now as they 
climbed, he studied them in turn. 



THE INVADERS 



61 




T HEY made the sounds of 
communication often. Red 
Spine recorded these in his mem- 
ory tissues as usual, though Jje 
wondered now if he would ever 
have the leisure and the peace to 
try to decipher them. 

One of the beings spoke deeply. 
“I’ve ridden whales on Cetus I and 
dinosaurs on Aldebaran II, but 
I do believe this is the first time 
I’ve climbed a living hill — ” 

Its smaller companion made the 
high trilling sound so irritating 
to Red Spine’s detectors. 

“Anyhow, Roscoe, this one 
won’t throw you. It must not have 
moved for ages. It probably 
can’t.” 

“It has appendages,” the third 
being vocalized. “They look like 
buried redwood trunks. It 4 s 
adapted to move. And,” it added 
maliciously, “if it moves, Ros- 
coe falls. He has ridden things— 
but he hasn’t ridden ’em far!” 

It was starshine, and the aliens 
were without their clumsy cover- 
ings. They- swung nimbly from 
spine to spine, chattering as they 
climbed. Finally they stood on 
the very peak of the giant cara- 
pace. They appeared small against 
the star canopy, but their sounds 
came clearly to Red Spine on the 
plain below. 

“All that food! Roscoe, give us 
the ecological justification 



for that. It looks like these crea- 
tures are starving themselves, 
using up their own feeding time 
and substance, just endlessly 
stuffing this thing. How do they 
profit?” 

“I think they don’t, Pegleg. 
They’re losing ground. They must 
have been doing it for many years, 
for certainly the creature grows. 
Notice how rushed they seem.” 

Red Spine got no meaning from 
the sounds. Still, he was watching 
the hurrying canceroids with 
their loads of food, and a cold con- 
cern was building in his thought 
centers. For he could detect, as 
the aliens could not, the mindless 
outrage of the Eater that its 
hunger was not being satisfied. 
Red Spine knew he was right. The 
Eater should not be fed at all. Per- 
haps it never should have been — 
but now it was no longer possible. 
They could not bring enough. 

“I’m going down to the intake 
end,” the larger of the deep-voiced 
aliens sounded. “There are proba- 
bly eyestalks under those crags 
down there. All of a sudden I 
think I know what this thing is!” 

“It’s steep,” the high sound said. 
“I’ll go back the way we came. 
Meet you at the bottom, Roscoe. 
Come on, Pegleg.” 

“I think I’ll just sit a spell and 
watch you both,” the other deep 
sound said. “First hill I ever 



62 



IF 




climbed where I couldn’t chip the 
rocks. A chiton-covered moun- 
tain! Wild!” 

Red Spine’s eyestalks were ful- 
ly extended. Puzzlement grew in 
him as the alien climbed down the 
Eater's carapace, paused at the 
giant eyestalk sheaths, then swung 
from spines above the almost ver- 
tical drop to the cavernous 
mouth opening below. 

Canceroids brought food. It was 
sponge tissue, the basic food, and 
the Eater swept it in with one great 
pedipalp. But it did not satisfy. 
What the Eater wanted, though 
probably it did not know it, was 
flesh. Meat. And its next move 
filled the watching Red Spine with 
cold horror. Yellow Stripe moved 
up in front of the great gaping 
maw, staggering under a food 
load. As canceroids had done for 
untold years, he deposited it the 
conventional distance from the 
mouth, turned to spin away. But 
the Eater could not wait. The huge 
pedipalp darted out, the long 
curved hooks gripped and both 
Yellow Stripe and his load were 
dragged against the enormous 
mandibles that ground like giant 
millstones. 

The canceroid gave a single 
despairing telepathic pulse, 
then the clashing gastric mill re- 
duced him to crushed biomass. 

Red Spine flashed a warning to 



other food bearers coming in 
across the desert. 

“Go back!” he projected. “The 
Eater destroys life! The Eater 
kills!” 

And as the living juices flowed 
into its gullet, the Eater, too, re- 
sponded. Its telepathic food cry 
changed, became savage. 

“Food! Food! Food!” 

H IGH on the top of the cara- 
pace the single alien grasped 
a spine and held on as the hill be- 
gan to rock. The mighty, buried 
appendages lashed free of the 
sand. The Eater lunged upward. 
It was only one movement of the 
locomotor limbs, but it threw the 
hill forward many diameters of 
a canceroid. Two food bearers 
understood too late. The pedi- 
palps darted, the mandibles 
clashed. The carriers and their 
loads followed Yellow Stripe. 

The small alien had completed 
its descent. In spite of its single 
pair of appendages it ran swiftly. 
But it did not run away. It circled 
the Eater, looking up to where the 
third alien clung to spines above 
the Eater’s mouth opening. 

“Climb back, Roscoe,’’ it 
shrilled and for once Red Spine did 
not mind the sound. He under- 
stood that it was doing what he 
had done. It was warning its own 
kind. 



THE INVADERS 



63 




The being above was struggling 
strongly. It pulled itself up spine 
by spine while the Eater ingested 
the food bearers. It was safe. Then 
the huge stalked eyes emerged 
from their sheaths, each far larger 
than the alien, and swung back and 
forth as the Eater sought further 
prey. The alien was swept from its 
hold and went plunging down to 
land heavily on the sand. 

The Eater reacted slowly. The 
being lay a short distance from its 
mouth opening, but it had come 
from above and the mindless mon- 
ster was confused. But only for a 
moment. The pedipalp darted, 
but it swept over the being lying 
prone, flattened against the sand. 
It had no second chance. 

The small alien leaned against a 
boulder. Its slender body seemed 
to be shudderifig. But in one hold- 
ing appendage it grasped a ta- 
pered cylinder, the artifact that 
none of them was ever without. 
The pedipalp moved again and a 
pale thin beam lanced from the cyl- 
inder. The base of the pedipalp 
glowed red. Smoke rose from it. 
Then with a violent, involun- 
tary spasm the Eater cast off the 
appendage. It lay twitching on 
the sand and where it had been at- 
tached a raw, seared stump dripped 
a dark viscous blood. 

Red Spine poised on his running 
appendages. His eyestalks pro- 



truded with wonder. The pale 
beam switched to the other pedi- 
palp — and again the violent au- 
totomy resulted. The Eater cast 
the appendage. Its telepathic 
projection was no longer a food 
call. It screamed with rage and 
pain. 

“Hurt! Hurt! Hurt!” 

It reared high and flung itself 
backward. It was as if a mountain 
moved on the landscape. 

The alien that had fallen rolled 
over and rested on its bent walking 
appendages. It held out its own 
, cylinder. The thin beam from it 
flashed directly into the wide and 
working mouth of the vast mon- 
strosity, the mouth through which 
so much food had passed for so 
many ages. This, its last meal, was 
a knifing ray of pure, ripping en- 
ergy. 

Red Spine’s receptors vibrated 
with a great pulse of agony. For a 
moment it came with terrifying 
volume — then it began to fade, 
to grow gentle. It ended almost as 
a sigh. And the canceroid knew, 
without knowing how he knew, 
that a whole era had ended on the 
homeworld. He'knew that the Eat- 
er was dead. 

The two aliens clung closely, 
their holding appendages 
wrapped around each other, their 
mouth orifices pressed together, 
and from the smaller one came

broken, sobbing sounds. Red 
Spine dutifully recorded every- 
thing on his memory tissues. Lat- 
er, he promised himself, he would 
decide what it all meant. 

Many pairs of stalked eyes fol- 
lowed steadily as the three aliens 
walked slowly away from the 
mountain of carrion that had 
been the Eater, walked toward the 
ship that loomed across the plain 
under the stars. As the sounds of 
their vocalizing grew faint with 
distance Red Spine shook the sand 
from his appendages and scut- 
tled furtively after them. He in- 
tended that his record of sounds 
should be complete, though the 
thought of the energy of the cyl- 
inders rested cold in his memory. 
He followed until an opening in 
the ship closed behind them. Then 
he settled himself in the sand, 
studying patiently. 

V 

liUT he did not know when, lat- 
*^er, one of the beings settled it- 
self into a small square space, like 
a repose cubicle, inside the great 
carrier. It rested on an artifact 
constructed to fit its bent walking 
appendages and curved body. In a 
holding chela it grasped a small 
stylus, with which it rapidly drew 
symbols on a thin layer of white 
material resting on another ar- 



tifact before it. Had he had op- 
portunity to see, it would have 
been one more wonder to Red 
Spine, for he would have recog- 
nized it as a record, an artificial 
device for remembering. 

And had it been possible to im- 
print what he saw onto his mem- 
ory tissues, symbol by symbol, 
his recall would have been thus: 

THE LOG OF THE 
STARDUST 
Earth Calendar A. D. 2125 . 

Log entry 41. Roscoe Kis- 
singer , Ecologist. Also Dr. 
Linda Kissinger , Micro- 
biologist and Dr. Pegleg 
Williams , Geologist. 

Twenty-sixth day , post 
landing. 

Well, we did it. 

It was a judgment thing 
and maybe we bent the let- 
ter of the ISC ruling that 
says: No interference with 
the lives or the activities of 
an aware species. For they 
are aware. No doubt about 
that. More than aware. High- 
ly intelligent, with a social 
structure undoubtedly satis- 
fying and effective. 

They have an ecological- 
ly balanced economy that 
Earth might take note of. 
And they had — note had 
— an economic problem. 



THE INVADERS 



65 




And that’s where we bent the 
letter. We solved it for them. 

Technically we have an 
out, I suppose. Without any 
interference three crew 
members would have had to 
move lively to save the skin 
of at least one of them. Be- 
ing that one, I’d have to say 
that it would have been 
tricky. But Lindy is good 
with that laser. 

We didn’t have to kill the 
thing. Our hand lasers could 
have — and did — cause it 
to cast off appendages. Like 
its normal species-mates, it 
probably would have re- 
generated them in time. But 
that would have called for 
more food. And that, I think, 
was the problem. 

The thing was a mutant, a 
mutant crab-being. How 
old it was is an interesting 
speculation, but we have 
no data at all. Undoubted- 
ly it grew in proportion to 
the amount of food they 
brought it and every molt 
upped its requirements for 
nourishment. And finally 
its need was greater than the 
environment could pro- 
duce. That was why it ran 
amok. 

I think we saved a race 
from serious damage or de- 



struction — a civilization 
of sorts. I agree that that’s no 
part of our function. The 
galaxy must be full of disin- 
tegrating ecosystems. And it 
could be that maybe we just 
postponed destruction, be- 
cause the intense hard radi- 
ation in the sun’s rays must 
cause many a mutation. 
They may recognize these 
and do something about 
them. If so, the giant got 
away from them. 

Maybe he developed un- 
usual size before they un- 
derstood. Maybe they fed 
him first from admiration 
— or to prevent him from 
bullying them and taking 
what they had collected. 
Maybe they worshiped him, 
thought he was a god. I’m 
speculating, Dr. Rasmus- 
sen, brainstorming, but it 
seems reasonable to record 
everything. You like a full 
log. So do I. So you’re get- 
ting it. 

I believe that the crab peo- 
ple, the -sand-dollar people, 
as Lindy has called them, 
understand about us. I 
think they know that we are 
not of this planet, that we 
constructed the Stardust , 
that we came out of space. I 
know they try to communi-

cate. Those blasted firefly 
lights! They symbolize 
something and I’m not sure 
what. Whatever it is, it’s 
friendly. 

There’s one, the big fellow 
with the long-spined cara- 
pace who can show red on ev- 
ery spine, that has haunted 
us, followed us around, 
watched us as carefully as 
we have watched them. He 
knows me. Whenever I’m 
close to him I give him a spe- 
cial arm-wave. He flashes his 
light. And he talks to me. Oh 
yes, he does! I can’t under- 
stand it — I can’t even hear 
it, but it’s there. I’ll prove it- 
— I think. 

When old Red Spine sits in 
front of me his eyestalks out 
as far as he can push them, 
those thirty-two append- 
ages rimming his carapace 
like an ornate fringe on a 
sombrero, he seems almost 
to be demanding that I lis- 
ten to him. But I can’t, of 
course. There isn’t any 
sound. There’s just one clue. 
My energy detector is sen- 
sitive to a faint stimulus 
when he comes near and es- 
pecially when he insists on 
communicating with me. It’s 
strongest then. 

So here’s more specula- 



tion. They’re telepaths. I’m 
picking up the energy of a 
mental projection. And I 
know they listen when we 
speak. They’re probably 
just as frustrated as we are. 

It may be judged interfer- 
ence, but I’ll never regret 
the demise of the mutant. If 
the International Space 
Council rules that we’ve ex- 
ceeded our mandate we’ll 
just have to take our lumps. 
What do they know? A var- 
mint as tall as a hill, with a 
diameter as great ks the 
length of a football field, 
sopping up the biomass of 
a whole ecosystem and giv- 
ing nothing but its wastes in 
return — uh-uh! If the 
aware life of this part of the 
planet were to survive he 
had to go. He couldn’t have 
persisted much longer any- 
how. His need for food was 
greater than his ability to 
gather it for himself. But he 
would have caused fearful 
havoc before he died. I think 
we arrived here at the criti- 
cal molt, the molt that broke 
the balance. Up to now the 
crab people could feed him. 
After that molt they 
couldn’t. He was too big. 

I had thought that they 
might eat the body, but you’ll

note in the tapes that they’re 
not doing so. Today we 
counted more than five thou- 
sand of them, streaming in 
from all directions, some 
from colonies hundreds of 
miles away. They’re taking 
apart that incredible ca- 
daver, dissecting it into 
transportable parcels, car- 
rying them away and bury- 
ing them. But they’re not do- 
ing it the easy way. They’re 
not using a limited area for 
a cemetery. They’re spread- 
ing him out over many square 
miles of sand and desert. In 
effect, they’re putting him 
back where he came from. 

Where those chunks are 
buried, the sponge clumps 
will grow faster and bigger. 
When they are pruned and 
harvested, they’ll regener- 
ate more swiftly. There’ll be 
enough food for everybody. 
Sure, I’m interpreting. 
Does anyone want to debate 
it? Look at your film, your 
charts, your records. Look 
at Ursula’s paintings. 

I think I’ll go out and say 
good-bye to : Red Spine, if I 
can find him. 

T HE days and nights of labor 
were ended. Where the enor- 
mous bulk of the Eater had al- 



ways been now there was nothing. 
For the first time in the memory 
of the oldest canceroid the sen- 
sors could not feel the sulky pres- 
sure of the creature’s insatiable 
hunger. Their nerve ends had quiv- 
ered for the last time to the mind- 
less, endless cry of “Food! Food! 
Food!.’’ 

“They are going,” Red Spine 
projected. “They have watched us 
dispose of the Eater. They know 
how we live, what we eat, how we 
die. It is, I think, their function to 
learn such things.” 

Red Spine had scrambled up the 
sloping surface of a large boul- 
der. Now he sat well above the de- 
sert floor, his stalked eyes flicking 
back and forth restlessly, his 
spines glowing. 

Across the desert, from every 
direction, the canceroids were’ 
coming. Each carapace glittered 
and flashed with the pattern that 
made every individual differ- 
ent. As the yellow sun Cancer 
dropped behind the uptilted 
range, the colors brightened. 

Since it had landed — many 
starshines ago— the great bulk of 
the carrier had lain inert, un- 
changing, unmoving. It had, in- 
deed, often opened holes in itself, 
through which the invader beings 
came out and went in. In the radi- 
ation of the sun they were always 
covered with the white cara-

paces, each showing the one large 
eye. In the starshine they were dif- 
ferent. The carapaces disap- 
peared — the beings were slender 
and pliant, their appendages thin. 
The one big eye was replaced by 
two small ones, without any stalks 
at all, and below these a mouth 
opening where all the sounds came 
out. Yet they were the same be- 
ings. They carried on the same ac- 
tivities, made the same sounds. It 
was possible to distinguish one 
from another by size and by the 
depth and the pitch of their noises. 
Red Spine had come to know sev- 
eral of them rather well. 

“They destroyed the Eater with 
ease,” Knobbed Claw signaled. 
“Are we wise to assemble here? 



Why should they not destroy us as 
well?” 

“What would be their purpose? 
They do not require a home- 
world. With their carrier they can 
go wherever they choose, perhaps 
to the very stars themselves. No,” 
Red Spine insisted, “they mean no 
harm to us. They wish us well.” 

“They wish us well,” Blue Dot 
echoed. “They destroyed the Eat- 
er. We assemble here to thank 
them.” 

“They wish us well!” The mes- 
sage pulsed from thought center to 
thought center, on out to the edges 
of the sea of great disks that spread 
over much distance and in all di- 
rections. around the alien craft. 
The sun was gone. In the starshine

each carapace glowed ever bright- 
er as the signal was repeated. The 
desert was a shimmering, shift- 
ing pattern of multicolored 
lights. 

The carrier responded. Its vast 
dark bulk began to show open- 
ings, more and more openings, 
and into these spaces the aliens 
crowded, their small eyes peering 
out onto the wide-spread gather- 
ing of canceroids. The aliens 
waved their appendages, their 
mouths opened and closed and Red 
Spine knew that they were making 
the noises of speech, though the 
clear substance that covered each 
opening did not allow the sounds 
to be heard. 

But then a sound did come, a 
great sound that was speech, as 
though the carrier itself spoke, 
and canceroids yet miles away 
heard it plainly. Red Spine still 
had no clues as to the meanings of 
the sounds, but he recorded all 
that he detected. In quieter times, 
when meditation and thought 
were again possible, he promised 
himself that he would learn to un- 
derstand them. 

So he recorded the great sound, 
the last he was'to hear. 

“Goodbye, crab people! We 
hope you’re here to show grati- 
tude, but if instead we’ve de- 
stroyed your god, we’re sorry. It 
seemed sort of necessary at the 



time. Anyhow, whether you know 
it or not, you’re better off.” 

Then another voice came, one 
well known to Red Spine. 

“So long. Red Spine old buddy! 
I’ve met a lot worse citizens than 
you. We wish you well!” 

The openings vanished. The car- 
rier lay, a long, black forbidding 
shadow, showing no life at all. 
Then slowly, gently, silently, it 
began to ‘rise. It swept easily in a 
huge circle over the thousands of 
canceroids, its dark bulk blotting 
out the starshine. High and higher 
it spiraled, the greatest marvel 
the homeworld Cancerol would 
know for countless ages. 

Red Spine atop his boulder felt 
a surge of feeling and he knew it 
was regret. He reared himself 
high on his many appendages. He 
fixed his stalked eyes on the dis- 
tant spacecraft — and flashed the 
peace sign. Others around him fol- 
lowed the example. Ten thou- 
sand pale golden beams lanced up- 
ward against the stars. 

The ship swung around once 
more. From it a cone of light 
flashed downward, light of the 
same quality as the small beams of 
the canceroids. 

The beings had learned the peace 
sign. They were civilized, after 
all. 

Red Spine sat alone on his boul- 
der and thought 1 — and wondered. •

THE 

MEANING 
OF THE 
WORD 



CHELSEA QUINN YARBRO 



I SAW something odd, fuzzed 
with the sand glimmering in the 
coral sunlight and I began to slog 
my way toward it. 

“Jhirinki, get back here!” Wol- 
ton ordered from the skiff. He was 
sounding angrier by the minute. 

“There’s something out — ” I 
tried to tell him but Almrid cut me 
off. 

“Let him alone, Wolton. Your 
jurisdiction goes no farther than 
the skiff.” Then, with scarcely a 
change in tone, he said to me, 
“You stay here until camp is set 
up. I want to know where every- 




Wolton gave him a sour smile 
and motioned me away. But it was 
important that they know about 
that irregularity. I tried again. “I 
saw something out there. It 
doesn’t look — ” 

“Wait until the camp is set up. 
We need to get some more defin- 
itive readings before we go ex- 
ploring. And—” Almrid added to 
Wolton — “we can’t get those with- 
out the prowler.” 

Wolton jerked the hatch of the 
skiff open. “All right. Here’s the 
prowler. You know that, it can’t 
get any better data from the sur- 
face than the monitors can.” 

“Look, Almrid — ” I began. 

“Not now, Peter. We’ll talk 
later. When we have more ac- 
curate material to work from.” 
This last was, of course, for Wol- 
ton. 

It was useless. I stepped back as 
Wolton reluctantly put the prowler 
in action, letting it scuttle out over 
the hazy sand, scanners clicking 
contentedly to itself. 

Sumiko Hyasu had barricaded 
herself behind her equipment, 
preparing to run soil tests. She 
and Langly, the biochemist, 
worked in silence, the remote 
sounds of their breathing mur- 
muring in my earphones. 

On the other side of the skiff I 
knew Parnini and Goetz were furl- 
ing the sails of the weather unit. I 



could hear them swearing oc- 
casionally. They were busy. Wol- 
ton and Almrid were still arguing. 
My eyes were dragged back again 
to that irregular spot in the sand 
that might be what I wanted. That 
might be digs. 

“I’m calling Captain Tamo- 
shoe,” Wolton declared to any- 
one who would listen. “I’m going 
to give him a status report.” 

“That is your responsibility,” 
murmured Almrid as he watched 
the prowler set zig-zagging in a 
widening spiral. His heavy head 
was even larger in the Class Eleven 
uniform. His hands hung like paws, 
wholly unlike what one expected 
in a virologist. It was hard to think 
of him doing the minute mani- 
pulations that were the mark of 
his work — it was like trying to 
imagine Caliban or Quasimodo 
making watches or microcir- 
cuitry. 

A yawning breeze wound a bit 
of dust on its finger and then sank 
back, too tired to hold it. That was 
the feel of the whole place — 
drowsiness. The wind barely 
breathed. The plain was heavy with 
dreaming, the sky unmarred by 
clouds where the greater of two 
suns hung about fifteen degrees 
above the horizon, a platter of 
polished copper. Our presence in- 
truded on this somnambulistic 
landscape where even the rocks

IF 




were softened and sometimes 
crumbling and in placejof dirt there 
was sand that was not sand flicker- 
ing in the monochrome stillness. 

Yet 1 wondered and hoped. 
There had been indications of 
structures from the monitors on 
the Nordenskjold. I knew my digs 
were here to be found, if only I 
knew where to look. 

“Jhirinki’s been wandering 
around,'’ Wolton was reporting 
and the sound of my name brought 
me back to the camp. He added in 
response to the captain’s garbled 
question, “It was Almrid’s idea to 
bring along an archeologist. Not 
mine. Ask him.” 

In the slow heat of the opal- 
escent afternoon work was 
sluggish. There was nothing for 
me to do but stare at the one odd 
spot in the distance — and wish. 

Goetz swore in my earphone as 
his equipment toppled for the sec- 
ond time, victim to the treach- 
erous shifting of the sand. “Need 
help?” I asked him, not reluctant- 
lyr 

“What I need is a foundation,” 
came his answer, the words bitten 
out in frustration. 

“According to the monitors,” 
Almrid said icily, directing the in- 
sult at Wolton, “there’s all kinds 
of rock around here. Or, maybe 
not rock. Maybe it once was build- 
ings." 



“Look, Almrid—” Wolton be- 
gan. 

Then, unexpectedly, Sumiko 
Hyasu cut in. “Leave him alone, 
Franz,” she said softly to Almrid. 
“We have work to do.” 

“It looks like you’ve wasted your 
trip, Peter,” Almrid said to me, a 
certain morose satisfaction in this 
statement. “Why don’t you ride 
up tonight and forget it? There 
are other planets.” 

I wondered if my disappoint- 
ment showed so much. 

“I think I’ll stick around for a 
while,” I said. 

4<¥ DON’T know, Sumiko,” I 
was saying as we watched the 
second skiff settle onto the sand. 
“I can’t give up the thought that 
there’s something here.” 

Absently she made some an- 
swer. 

“Don’t you feel that?” 

“I suppose so.” She was only 
half-listening. This world was too 
unknown, too compelling for us 
to pay much attention to each 
other. Everyone of us saw it 
through his/her eyes only, “Is any 
of this real, Peter?” she asked. “Or 
is the planet hiding from us?” 

I had felt that from the first. 
Something was hidden here right 
under our noses and we hadn’t the 
sense to find it. But all I could do 
was shrug. I didn’t know then what

she wanted to find, what it was she 
had been searching for with that 
terrible, fragile intensity that 
marked her more than her beauty. 

“What do you want to find?” she 
asked me. 

“Oh, I don’t know.” It was a lie 
and, like a lot of lies, it felt ugly. 
But I couldn’t admit to her that I 
had longed for the chance to find a 
lost civilization here, to be the 
first to decipher its language. Peo- 
ple could be known and under- 
stood by the way they used words, 
and to be the first to understand 
in that way had been an obsession 
with me since before I trained on 
the Probe Ship Magalhaes. 

“You’re going to do some ex- 
ploring later?” It wasn’t really a 
question, it was a dismissal. 

“Whenever Aljnrid and Wol- 
ton get tired of fighting and give a 
general release, then, yes. I’ll go 
exploring.” Neither of them was 
willing to stop feuding long 
enough to let the expedition get 
moving and I was becoming riled 
at the delay. But Commander 
Markham would be in the next 
skiff and knowing Josh, he would 
put an end to the sparring that had 
taken up too much time already. 

“Good luck,” she murmured 
and went back to her equipment. 
Then, as she started adjusting the 
sample breakdowns, her voice 
sounded again in my earphones. 



“Why wait? Why not do what you 
want to do?” 

B Y THE time the base camp 
had been set up and the full 
complement of expedition staff 
had been ferried down the surface 
shelters were waiting. I had spent 
the long afternoon struggling 
with ring supports, emplacing 
the doughnut-shaped foundations 
for the inflatable buildings, but 
now it was night. 

I walked away from the camp, 
watching the unfamiliar sky. 
There were more and brighter stars 
above me and some eleven dis- 
similar moons coursed overhead 
in a bewildering tangle. 

In a while I found the irregular 
stone, although I had not con- 
sciously been looking for it — I 
had been drawn to it as surely as 
fur draws static. I knew that it 
would tell me what I wanted to 
know, if only I could puzzle it out 
before Captain Tamoshoe or- 
dered us all back to the Nor- 
denskjold. Yet, as I stood over it, 
not knowing where to look or 
what I was looking for, I could 
still mock myself for being so ob- 
sessed with wanting to find a lan- 
guage and a culture that obvious- 
ly had failed in all this desolation. 
What could it teach us? 

So I paced the thing off non- 
chalantly. It was not too large.

this oblong section of rock, rath- 
er like one of the old headstones in 
the landmark cemeteries. 

I kneeled in the sand and rubbed 
at the side of the block — and 
touched what I thought at first was 
a flaw or chip in the surface. Cur- 
ious, I bent closer, gently blowing 
the clinging dirt from the slab with 
my sweat valve, brushing the stone 
clear as I worked. 

And then, there it was. Without 
any doubt, without any am- 
biguity, the glyphs appeared un- 
der my hands. I drew back to get a 
proper look at them. 

£-1 cbocS^©^ 

For several minutes I sat and 
looked at them. The stillness of 
the night was suddenly alien. 
Eight low relief marks on a 
rock — and I felt for the first time 
that all I am was justified. 

I rose, wiping more of the block 
free of the sand, but I could find 
nothing more. The inexorable 
movement of the sand might have 
worn other markings away, or 
perhaps the stone reached deeper 
into the ground than I had thought 
at first, with more glyphs farther 
down. Almrid and Wolton had 
said something about erosion. 
Perhaps this had been high above 
the sand, once. 

It seemed like a long way back 



to the camp just to get a shovel and 
some help. I stood, rubbing my 
hands together to free them of the 
dust that was clinging insidiously 
to them and to film of my surface 
suit. Was it worth it, going all the 
way back? I could do more here to- 
night even without tools. And if I 
went back, Almrid or Wolton 
would be sure to try to stop me 
from coming back. In the morn- 
ing I could bring some of the ex- 
pedition with me, but then this 
find would no longer be mine. I 
finally accepted the rationaliza- 
tion that left me alone with my 
particular dream for a little 
longer. 

Setting to work, I scooped arm- 
loads of the soil away from the 
block, hoping to discover more 
glyphs. I felt that I had found the 
key to a larger discovery. 

It was on the fifth armload that 
I fell through into the room. 

D UST spread out around me 
like a reverse halo against the 
shiny surface of the floor. I tasted 
grit — the suit must have ruptured 
somewhere. As I lay on the floor I 
took stock. No bones broken, but 
some dandy bruises. I gathered 
my knees beneath me and care- 
fully stood up. It was dark down 
here except for the shine from the 
moons through the hole. There was 
no other light. 



THE MEANING OF THE WORD 



75 




With uncertain fingers I 
grabbed for my litepak and found 
it undamaged. Thumbing it, I 
found that it could hardly reach 
beyond the sand on the floor. Af- 
ter a moment of thought I turned 
it off and began walking slowly in 
an outward spiral. 

On the third round I bumped in- 
to a thing, apparently of stone, 
about the size of a half-chair with a 
shoe-shaped projection. It felt 
smooth and solid. 

“Curiouser and curiouser,” I 
said aloud to the unechoing 
blackness. 

Slowly I wandered back to the 
sand haze on the floor, the site of 
my fall. I looked up at the rent in 
the roof. The realization rushed 
in on me then that I was truly cut 
off from the expedition. I had left 
my commkit at the camp and my 
litepak’s trickle of a beam could 
not have been seen by anyone at 
that distance. The sand filtered 
down through the hole, whisper- 
ing. 

And the light was failing. Two 
of the moons had set since I had 
fallen into my find and I could not 
get out without light. 

Let ’s leave that alone for the mo- 
ment , Jhirinki, I told myself for 
comfort. 

Then, as I watched, the great 
heavy stone I had loosened by my 
fall gave a kind of sigh and, with 



deceptive languor, tumbled end 
over end to crash and shatter on 
the floor. If it had fallen straight 
down, that would have been the end 
of Peter Jhirinki. 

Badly shaken, I went back to 
the object I had walked into 
earlier. My hands shook when I 
reached out to steady myself, and 
I drew them back. 

Perhaps I should touch nothing 
here until I knew what had made 
that great stone fall. Were other 
stones still in the ceiling above me? 

Anxiously I pulled out my lite- 
pak again and played its feeble 
beam over the ceiling. But the fact 
that I saw no other blocks of stone 
was actually small comfort. This 
room was an important find and I 
was without means to see it — and 
now too isolated to get the help I 
needed. I also remembered there 
was a tear in my suit, which might 
or might not mean anything on 
this planet. 

Again I wandered back to the 
place beneath the hole, taking 
care not to get near the gently fall- 
ing sands. 

“Peter!” 

For a moment I didn’t believe 
the sound in my suit phone. Then, 
as my name was called again, I 
realized that I had been missed 
and that a party was searching 
for me. 

“Yeo!” I yelled, full of relief. 



76 



IF 




The stream of dust into the hole 
increased. 

“Peter Jhirinki — ” Now that the 
voices were closer I was able to 
pick out Markham's among the 
others — a large resonant sound 
that no commsystem could 
properly handle. 

“Down here — ” More rivulets 
of the soft dust were pouring down 
now and I wondered how strong 
the roof was. “Be careful — I 
don’t know how long the roof here 
willhold.” 

“Thanks. Markham’s voice. 
“We’ll get you out of there. Dom- 
inguiz went back for the rig.” Af- 
ter a moment’s silence Josh 
Markham asked, “And did you 
find anything down there, Pete?’’ 

It took me a little time to an- 
swer him. “I hope so,’’ I said final- 
ly. Then, as I looked around the 
dark, I didn’t want to leave. “Drop 
me a litepak, will you?’’ 

“Right.” And in a moment 
Markham’s litepak in its crash- 
case thudded to the floor. “Dom- 
inguiz will be back any time, Pete. 
Make it short.’’ 

B UT I knew that. I wrenched 
the litepak from its case and 
pressed the switch. The beam 
stabbed into the darkness, show- 
ing me the room for the first time. 

It was large, low-ceilinged and 
shiny save for the place where I had 



brought in the sand. Two of the 
walls were a patchwork of de- 
signs, intricate embossed pat- 
terns on tilelike bricks. The other 
two walls . 

The other two walls were cov- 
ered with glyphs. 

“Get ready, Pete.” Markham 
cut into my discovery like razor 
into flesh. “I can’t get this very 
steady. You’ll have to guide it com- 
ing out.’’ 

There was a clank of the rig as 
the saddle hit the floor, then the 
purposeful clicking of the pulleys 
set in motion. 

Quickly I straddled the saddle, 
grabbing the upper sling so that I 
could help control the lift. 

“We’re under way,” Markham 
called as the rig hoisted me into 
the air. 

I turned the beam of the litepak 
on the walls as I rose, letting the 
light linger on the marks for as 
long as I could. 

I got my back scraped coming 
out of the hole, but I was too pre- 
occupied to notice it until Josh 
Markham said, “Holy Mama, 

.ere did you get that?” 

I looked at my arm, saw noth- 
ing and shrugged. 

“Your back, man, your back.” 

As soon as he said it, the pain hit 
like a hammer. “Oh. That.” For a 
moment I concentrated on the 
damage and decided that it

77 




wasn’t that much. “Coming out of 
the hole, I think. Is it bad?” 

Relieved, Josh said, “It’s 
messy. Have Sanderson look at it 
back at the base. He’ll want to 
check you for foreign bugs any- 
way. What the devil did you find 
down there?” 

“Words,” I said quietly. “A 
whole world of words.” 

“There are ruins down there?” 
He asked it incredulously, his big 
body slewing about in the sand. 
“A city?” 

“I don’t know about the city, but 
there sure as hell are words. May- 
be a complete language. I’m go- 
ing back down tomorrow and find 
out.” 

Markham eyed me suspicious- 
ly. “What if Wolton says other- 
wise? What if I sfcy otherwise?” 

“It wouldn’t matter.” As I said 
it, I knew it could make no dif- 
ference what they said. Nothing 
anyone could say or do would 
keep me out of that hole now that I 
had seen the wall. 

“All right, Pete. But don’t push 
your luck. This place is still terra 
incognita as far as we’re con- 
cerned.” 

I nodded. “That’s just it. It 
won’t be unknown if I can get a 
chance at that wall. There’s the 
whole puzzle, right down there. 
Complete with solution.” 

“Hdy, won’t machines do as 



well?” Dominguiz put in, having 
listened to us as he stowed the gear 
in the crawler. “We got machines 
for that.” 

“No. I spoke harshly, but 
there was no way for me to say it 
kindly. “No machine wrote that, 
no machine is going to read it. 
That is what I’m trained for. That’s 
why I’m part of the crew. And it’s 
what I’ve wanted to do all my life.” 

“Sure. Sure. I don’t care 
whether you get yourself ruined. I 
just want to know. Academics!” 
He sat down in the driving cock- 
pit. “You two can ride in the back 
if you want.” He didn’t wait for an 
answer, preferring his machines to 
our company. 

Josh Markham and I scrambled 
aboard as the crawler began its 
lurching way off through the sand. 
Only it wasn’t sand. 

“Josh,” I said uncertainly as 
we clung to the rear platform of 
the crawler. “I think I know what 
this stuff is.” 

“The dirt? Damned persistent, 
isn’t it?” 

“It isn’t dirt,” I told him slowly, 
avoiding his eyes. “I think it’s 
ash.” 

THIS is where you dis- 
appeared to,” Franz Almrid 
said, wiping his hands in a futile 
gesture to rid them of the ash. 

“Yes.” I was beaming with 



78 



IF 




pride. In the morning light the 
hole was even better than I had 
thought. 

“What is it?" Almrid’s voice 
held open sarcasm as he looked at 
the figures on the wall. “Looks 
like spermatozoa in formation 
with math symbols." 

“It does at that," I admitted, 
determined not to fight with Aim- 
rid. The very fact that there had 
been something worth discover- 
ing on this planet had made him 
furious. 

“You really think you’re going 
to get sense out of that?" He gave 
a derisive laugh. “You’re kidding 
yourself, Jhirinki." 

I was spared the problem of an- 
swering him by Josh Markham, 
who* was lowered into the hole on 
the new cable rig. 

“Looks good, Pete," Josh said, 
craning his corded neck, trying to 
see it all without turning around. 
“What’s next?" 

“Well, that wall," I told him, 
pointing to the farthest one, “is 
probably not worth much. It’s too 
scarred and faded. But this — " I 
looked at the longer wall with its 
bright surface and clear mark- 
ings — “is a treasure." 

It was as if I had finally lured a 
much-sought mistress into my 
bed. That wall, with its thousands 
of glyphs in neatly horizontal 
lines was more than I had ever 



hoped to have for myself. 

“You’re a damned romantic, 
that’s what you are,’’ Josh said 
with a chuckle. “Well, while you’re 
busy down here, we’ll just go along 
and dig up a few square miles of 
ash, in case there might be a city 
down there." 

I’d told him that there might be, 
late late last night after I had re- 
ported the find. In the morning I 
wondered if I’d been right, but \tt 
it go. The chance was worth a look. 

“If you’re sure this is a building, 
where is the door? Or did they all 
tumble in the way you did?’’ 
Almrid’s icy tone stopped both 
Josh and me. 

I hated to admit it, but Almrid 
had a point. If this had been a 
building there had to be a way in 
and out of it. And no matter what 
size or shape the inhabitants a 
door is a door is a door. 

“Maybe in the floor?" Josh sug- 
gested. “This is pretty high up, 
judging from the few readings 
we can get around here. Maybe 
this was an attic or a sun room." 
He looked at me hopefully, his big 
hands rubbing at the ash. 

“It’s possible.’’ Looking 
around the room I knew there was 
an answer. I just had to be left 
alone to find it with my instincts 
and my pores. 

“There’s nothing for us peas- 
ants to do but dig," Almrid said

acidly. “All right. Professor. 
Well do it your way.” He went to 
the sling and was hauled out of the 
hole. 

“Don’t let him bother you, 
Pete,” Josh said with all the reas- 
surance he could muster. “He 
doesn’t like the place and can’t fig- 
ure out why.” 

“I know.” 

A short silence fell. 

“Well, I’ll leave you to your 
work. Call if you need help.” 

“I will,” I promised him as he 
rose through the hole. 

W HEN he was gone I circled 
the room again, looking at 
the wall with the glyphs. There was 
a key somewhere. There had to be. 
I could find it if I thought about it. 
Again I came U) the bench-like af- 
fair. Again I studied the surface of 
the shoe end. It was smooth and 
faintly luminous. For a moment 
it seemed to be the reflection of 
one of the suns — and then I rea- 
lized that neither was shining 
down directly. This made me won- 
der. 

I sat on the half-chair (which was 
a bit too low and too small for 
comfort). This might be the clue I 
wanted. In my annoyance I 
tapped the cool, faintly glowing 
sheet of — was it stone? The echo 
sounded unused. I went on tap- 
ping absent-mindedly as I tried 



to take stock of the wall and the 
*room. 

Blink . 

I was so startled that I raised my 
hand. The light, if there had been a 
light, stopped. 

But now I had a hope. Gently I 
tapped the surface again. Then 
firmly. 

BLINK 

Then I put my hands full and 
solidly onto the surface of the 
table, pressing it, willing the light 
to continue. “Come on, light,” I 
pleaded with it. “Blink.” 

Almost ridiculously, it did. 
First there was a flicker, then a 
wavering opacity and finally a 
bright glow. 

“What the bloody hell is this?” I 
asked of the air joyously. Since 
there was no one but me to an- 
swer, I shook my head in ignor- 
ance. 

The light in the table was in- 
creasing, growing brilliant. Sym- 
bols formed on it: 

r°1o^: + 

“I think — ” I said to the ma- 
chine. Then l realized that 1 would 
have to stop thinking and be will- 
ing to learn. “Machine, you and I 
have a little mutual understand- 
ing to do.” 

The symbols faded but the light 
stayed on, full and strong. I hesi-

tated — then, taking my stylus, 1 
made a small circle on the table 
and put nine dots leading out from 
it, added little points for the 
moons. When this was done, I 
drew a box around Terra and 
waited. 

The machine buzzed. 

On a guess I wiped the marks 
away. 

In a moment the machine 
showed two circles and a series of 
dots, putting a box around the 
fourth one. This was the fourth 
planet, but the machine showed 
only three moons. This bothered 
me, but there was no way to ques- 
tion the machine about it. I would 
have to wait. 

But we were on the right track. 

I duplicated the Sol system dia* 
gram and boxed Terra and labeled 
it. 

The machine made the planets 
again, with the puzzling moons. 

“All right. Now that we're in- 
troduced, let's get down to lan- 
guages." 

The machine began to hum, 
making periodic squeaks. I 
couldn't have it malfunction now. 
I fumbled over the sides, looking 
for knobs or dials that might help. 
The hum and the squeaks merged 
into a rising wail. 

“Wait a bit," I told it. 

I moved my hands again, rub- 
bing the sides firmly until a single 



dot appeared on the screen in front 
of me and I heard, very clearly the 
single word: “Ge/.” 

My hands began to shake. I 
sensed that this was a machine in- 
tended to teach, to inform. The 
concept was not unfamiliar to 
human archeologists — men of 
many eras had left time capsules 
or other record of their passing 
for future centuries to Find. Who- 
ever had left this artifact had 
known what he was about. The im- 
plications took a little time to 
sink in. 

The machine formed another 
dot directly above the first and 
called it: Shy/* 

It was giving me the elements 
of language. Those two symbols 
were part of the name of the plan- 
et. 

A vertical line connected the 
two dots and the dots faded out. 
“Sti,” said the machine in its 
parody of a voice. 

I took out my scanner and 
trained it on the table top. The 
scanner would give the Nor - 
denskjold a record of all this in 
case something went wrong down 
here. 

TT hen 1 set to work, the ma- 
chine reciting its language to 
me, showing it to me, bringing 
it to life. 

“Pete! Pete! Answer me!" The

81 




commkit beside me sounded put 
out. The voice was Sumiko’s, high 
and overcontrolled. I wondered 
if she had been calling for long. I 
had been absorbed. 

I stood up stiffly from the 
bench, muscles protesting, and 
reached for the kit. 

“Pete — ” it went in my ear. 

“Yeo. I’m here. What is it?” 
“This is Sumiko. I’ve finished 
the tests on the silt from your digs. 
You’re right. It is ash.” 

“I know. Look,” I said, rushing 
on, “I may be way off, but I think 
you might find some evidence of 
volcanic or — I don’t know, earth- 
quakes, maybe, a long time ago. 
There’d be a lot of them, occurring 
all at once or with little warning. 
The diagram I’ve found down here 
shows only thpee moons. Either 
we’ve got the wrong planet or 
things have changed upstairs — ” 
“What diagram?” she inter- 
rupted. 

“There’s a device down here 
that teaches the language,” I ad- 
mitted reluctantly. “It seems to 
be programed to communicate 
with strangers — I mean beings 
possibly alien to whoever or 
whatever made it, which suggests 
that the culture of which it was a 
part anticipated being wiped out. 
The device and I have just begun 
to come together on basics — I 
should get the rest in a few days.” 



“You’ll let me know?” This was 
said too quickly. 

“Sure, Sumiko.” Right then, I 
wanted her to find what she was 
seeking, too. There had to be 
something here to compensate 
for the terrible hunger at the back 
of her eyes also. 

“You’ll need tools,” she said de- 
cisively. 

“Maybe some digging tools. 
Brushes for the walls. Levers and a 
couple of files. There’s a pack in 
my shelter.” 

“Is that all? I’ll bring them 
along.” 

“Thank you.” There was a 
jealousy in me as I spoke. I was 
not yet ready to share my hole, my 
wall. Not with anyone. Not even 
Sumiko, the one person who 
might understand what I felt. 

“I’ll be there as soon as the cap- 
tain is ready to come over.” 

In some surprise I asked her, 
“Is he down on the surface? I 
didn’t think he was planning to 
come.” 

“He and Wolton have been go- 
ing over the whole camp for about 
the last hour. .He’s had Almrid 
and Dominguiz in. I gave them my 
report earlier.” 

A prickle ran along my spine, a 
feeling that gravity had shifted, 
immeasurably, under my feet. 
The captain had gone to the soil 
chemist and a biophysicist before 



82 



IF 




the archeologist on a planet with 
digs. Something wasn’t right. 

“Pete?” 

“What?” 

“I’ll see you later?” 

“Yeah,” I said. “It’s going to be 
interesting.” And with that I 
signed off. 

Standing there in my hole, with 
the language of Shy-gei-ath wait- 
ing for me, I frowned, wondering 
what had gone wrong. No one had 
come in with a negative report. 
There had been no warnings about 
the virology level or the func- 
tional radiation ratings that 
usually got the captain on the 
groung long enough to get every- 
one back to the ship. 

I remembered my scraped back 
from the evening before, but that 
couldn’t figure in anything. The in- 
jury itched unpleasantly under 
the thin surface suit and there had 
been some trouble getting it to 
scab over. But that was hardly 
enough to worry about. What was 
Captain Tamoshoe doing down 
here, anyway? Why had he come? 

The machine was reciting “co- 
rel-sti-gei" “sa-che-sti-gei" p, 
“co-sa-che-sti-gei” P , when I final- 
ly heard the noise above me. I 
tapped the machine on what I'd 
come to think of as the hold but- 
ton and waited for visitors. 

They took their time. Once 1 
heard Franz Almrid swear, use 



cold words with venom I had nev- 
er heard from him before. 

A T LAST the sling came down, 
bearing Captain Nemeu 
Tamoshoe, black on black. 

“Jhirinki,” he said, turning his 
trademark grin on me, a display 
of large white teeth in a face only 
slightly lighter than his black cap- 
tain’s uniform. And in that face, 
which dictated eyes of obsidian, 
Captain Tamoshoe’s smouldered 
the impossible blue of Aegean 
waters. 

“What’s wrong, Captain?” 

But he didn’t answer me, not 
right away. He got off the sling and 
began to walk around the hole. 
“Have you been able to decipher 
this?” he asked me, pointing at my 
wall. 

I knew that there was some- 
thing very wrong then. “That sec- 
tion you’re pointing to reads from 
right to left: 'Thir de-lom-sti-gei 
jhae emh bis lom-de-sti-gei / Sec- 
ond line: ‘ Thu shy-ens emh thu 
lom-qua-fer-de-sti-gei sir-ath- 
gei/" 

“Which means?” 

“That is what the walls says, sir. 
In fact, right now I can read out 
loud every word up there and 
make the symbol for it if I hear it 
spoken. But I don’t yet know what 
it means, because this machine 
does not have a way to tell me un-

til it has explained to me all the 
elements of its language. But the 
communications center on the 
ship will have records of this so I 
can work from them, if neces- 
sary.” 

Captain Tamoshoe looked at 
me evenly for about a minute, an 
eternity. “I am sorry, Jhirinki. 
The commcenter didn’t pick up. the 
relay. Almrid and Wolton were too 
busy wrangling to center the chan- 
nel.” 

“I don’t understand — ” and as I 
said it I did understand. 

“Radiology reported a variance 
last night. This place was hot. That 
little machine of yours has been 
running along on plutonium and 
the room was sealed. You fell into 
a vat of radon gas — ” He stopped. 
Then: “There’s isn’t much danger 
on the surface of course, but we 
don’t know how many of these 
things there are. I am sorry, 
Jhirinki.” 

“Wait — ” Josh Markham ap- 
peared in the hole, hanging onto 
the sling too tightly, his large face 
drawn and his eyes heavy. “Cap- 
tain?” 

“I have told him what I could. 
You can explain it more thorough- 
ly if necessary. Are we ready to 
ferry up?” 

“Almost.” 

Again Captain Tamoshoe: “It 
is a pity. This is surely the find of a 



lifetime.” He turned back to me, 
blue eyes hooded. “Well, perhaps 
you will be able to reconstruct 
much of this from memory, do you 
think? There isn’t much time and it 
would be a shame to lose all of it.” 
“How do you mean" lose it?” I 
was frightened then, not of the 
radiation that had slid in through 
my respirator into my bones, but 
of leaving Shy-gei-ath. I had come 
so far. I did not want to leave. 

“Looks like this one was more 
trouble than it was worth, Pete,” 
Markham said, trying to keep his 
tone light and failing. 

“No.” 

“Pete—” 

“No,” I told them again, step- 
ping back to the teaching ma- 
chine. “I’ve almost got it all. I’m 
so close to the meaning of it. It 
won’t take too much longer. I’ll be 
out of here in no time.” 

J OSH shook is head. “Can’t do 
it, Pete. You’ve been exposed. 
We should have brought you out 
before now, but I knew this was 
damned important to you.” 

“Wait — ” I said, licking my 
lips. “What is the treatment for 
radon? Can’t I take decontamina- 
tion and then come back. It’s gone 
now — and I’d be safe.” 

“I am sorry, but we'll have to 
put the place in quarantine until 
we know how much potential

IF 




danger remains,” Captain Tamo- 
shoe said apologetically. “You un- 
derstand the necessity, don’t you? 
When all investigations have 
been made we can come back.” 
“But what about that?” I 
pointed to the wall, already haz- 
ing from the dust filtering down. 
“How much longer will that be 
here once the ash gets in? The oth- 
er walj, is almost useless. This one 
will be ruined.” 

“There may be others.” 

“And maybe there aren’t.” I 
knew I was starting to . sweat. 
“And the machine will be ruined.” 
Captain Tamoshoe shook his 
head. “I can recommend speed 
and claim emergency status on the 
artifacts. The Navy is aware of 
the value of this sort of find. We 
might be able to have full Class 
Nine suits authorized.” 

“You’ve got to leave, Pete.” 
Markham had taken a step toward 
me. I stepped back. 

“Commander Markham,” the 
captain said quietly. 

“Take a look at your hands, 
Pete.” Josh shot an angry look at 
Captain Tamoshoe as he spoke. 

“What about my hands?” But as 
I looked down and saw what 
looked like varicose veins in my 
palms I closed the marks inside 
my fists. 

“The skiff is waiting, Pete.” 

“Let it wait.” And as Josh 



started toward me I raised the 
commkit ovei; my head. “Don’t 
try it. Josh— 1 will use this.” 

It wasn’t much of a weapon, but 
it made Josh stop. “You stupid 
kid,” he said dispassionately. 
“You’re going to die.” 

“Am 1?” I asked Captain 
Tamoshoe. 

“Almost certainly,” he an- 
swered me. 

Without moving from the place 
I stood I said. “Get out of here. 
Josh. I want to talk to the cap- 
tain.” 

Josh looked at me with an ex- 
pression I had once seen in my fa- 
ther’s eyes. Then, with a nod to the 
captain, he let himself be hoisted 
out of the hole. 

“He wants you to live, Jhirinki. 
And you were not assigned to my 
ship to die.” 

In the stillness that followed his 
words I realized that he and I were 
the only people left here, that the 
others were back at the ferry, wait- 
ing to leave Shy-gei-ath. 1 felt an 
enormous loneliness fall over me, 
dark and heavy. 

“Why not come back?” 

I shook my head. “No. This is 
what I'm all about. 

I’ve spent my life learning to do 
what has to be done here. To add to 
what men may someday have to 
know. I can’t leave when I’m this 
close.” 



THE MEANING OF THE WORD 



85 




“Have you a choice?” 

For just a moment I knew 
panic. Then: “Will I last all that 
much longer if I leave?” 

“No. Not that much longer.” 
“Then I’ll stay.” 

“But what will you do, Jhirinki? 
The strange part was that I knew 
the answer. “As long as I can. I’ll 
describe the forms to you, the way 
the machine did for me. You can 
leave me a skiff relay, can’t you?” 
Not waiting for an answer I hur- 
ried on. “I’ll try to translate what 
I’ve found and you can record it for 
the Margien Language In- 
stitute.” 

Captain Tamoshoe considered 
this. “I’ve always thought,” he re- 
marked absently, “that a man’s 
death should be as much in his 
hands as his life. You’ll get the re- 
lay.” 

“And food?” 

He didn’t answer me, so I knew. 
“Thank you. Captain.” 

“Goodbye, Peter Jhirinki,” he 
said as he left. 

44T OM-DE-STI-GEI ath dev 
-L* lim-gei,” I dictated from 
the wall to the commkit. I listened 
for the relay sound that would tell 
me they had recorded the line on 
board the Nordenskjold . 

A half-dozen lines were left. 
Lines that wavered in front of me, 
milky with haze. 



“Pete!” 

But that wasn’t my machine. It 
was someone I used to know. Why 
would Josh call me? What did he 
want? 

“Pete, for God’s sake!” 

“What?” 

That must have been what he 
wanted to hear. But I couldn’t hold 
my commkit steady. My hands 
had gone funny. Purple. TJje ten- 
dons were soft, spongy. 

“ . translations?” 

That mattered to me. That was 
important. More important than 
my strange hands. I had to tell 
them. 

“A few words — ” 

“What words?” 

“Shy-gei-ath.” Like Terra and 
Terrans. 

The twin suns were hot above 
me, but it was dark. I burned and 
burned and it was dark. If I looked 
at the floor I could see my face. But 
I didn’t do that. 

“The wall, Pete. The wall.” 

From here on the floor I could 
watch my wall as I told theYn about 
it. I knew what it meant at last. 

“Shy, infinitive verb. To be. Ac- 
tive sense. Gei, infinitive verb. To 
be. Passive sense. Shy-sti-gei, to 
be alive. Sti-gei to exist. Shy-sti to 
conceive. They build from there.” 
Was that sound me? 

“But the wall, Pete.” 

It was an effort, >but I began to

read. But breathing hurt and I got 
slower and slower. “In the time of 
the Fourth Moon, I sought out a 
high place and made it safe against 
the end of Shy-gei-ath . " 

“Go on.” 

“Against the end it hap- 
pened I found this place and re- 
quired a stronghold be built. The 
time was short for we could see in 
the night in the Fourth Moon. Wa- 
ters would soon rise, the moun- 
tains change and Rel-ath-gei would 
consume all.” That would quiet 
them, the noisy ones above me. I 
looked at the wall through darken- 
ing eyes, turning on the floor to 
read the end of the story. 

“Peter! Answer me!” 

I kicked the commkit, laughing. 

“What about the place name.

Reluctantly I pulled myself

DAVID MAG/L 

Such a disorderly young 
lady! How come she was 
working for law and order? 

I ’M A cop. Nothing surprises me. 

A cop gets to see it all — too 
much of it and too much of it bad. 
The worst is death when a kid buys 
it. The toughest thing of all is hav- 
ing to look down at the body of a 
once breathtakingly beautiful 
young girl. 

I’m a detective. The name’s 
Mike Winsor. I was looking down 
at the body as the M.E. was getting 
set to do his onceover. She’d been a 
beauty. Age was a little tough. It 
wasn’t more than seventeen by that 
good young body- the face looked 
even younger. 

Story was simple. For some rea- 
son she’d been damn fool enough 
to try to cut across Central Park at 
night. Somebody jumped her and 
then used the knife. That much was 
easy. 

I tore my eyes away from her. 
Doc had peeled back the shroud 
and it was hard to look away. Best 




legs I’d ever seen and everything 
else she had was that good. Some 
guys in the department were going 
to save her pictures as memorabilia 
of waste or for other reasons. But 
they weren’t my problem. 

I had her purse. It had been 
found right beside her. It was new. 
Inside there were no cosmetics, not 
even a comb — yet, even after she 
had been jumped and killed, her 
hair was done neatly. 

“That a wig?’’ I asked the Doc. 

“Nope. That’s all her.’’ 

No handkerchief in the purse. 
No change. One ten-dollar bill, 
new, crisp. And there were three 
buttons. They looked like buttons. 
I picked them out and looked at 
them. They didn’t have holes in 
them. So they weren’t buttons. 
Some kind of metallic substance, 
but what they were and what they 
were made of was a lab problem. 

So that was it. Unless a miracle 
happened it was going to be one 
more unsolved murder. If she was a 
runaway or something I wondered 
whether we’d even find out who she 
was. But she had that body and 
that face. We might get lucky, I 
thought. She was worth acknowl- 
edging. 

“Hey, Mike. A key. Hotel 
Mercury.’’ 

“Hers?” 

“Could be,’’ my partner said. 
“Looks clean. Couldn’t have been 
out here too long. If she had it in 
her hand when they got her, 
maybe — ’’ 



“Okay. Doc? Anything?’’ 

He looked up at me, his eyes 
slitted, brow furrow. “Body tem- 
perature’s all wrong. It’s normal 
or damn close to it.” 

“She’s dead?” 

“Look at that wound. She 
Wed — the blood’s coagulated. 
There’s no way her temperature 
can be normal. Here, feel here. 
And look at this.” He pulled up the 
torn skirt even further. 

“So?” 

“Raise your eyes, boy.” 

“Belly button?” 

“That’s right. A perfect 
rectangle.” 

“What’s it mean? Anything? She 
a Martian?” 

“Yeah. Ha-ha. I don’t know 
what it means. No pulse. No other 
irregularities. But give me a call in 
about four hours. I’m going to give 
this young lady a complete 
physicial.” 



I CHECKED out the body and 
left the rest of the work with my 
partner. Then I drove over to the 
Mercury. It was the new ho- 
tel — expensive, a handsome place. 
I showed my shield, showed the 
key, described the body. No prob- 
lem there. “Mary or Alice Smith.” 
Both knockouts, my description 
could fit either one. They’d been in 
a week. Registration form showed 
no prior address. Unusual, a viola- 
tion of NYCPLH679331 — ninety 
days, fifteen-hundred-dollar fine,

and a license renewal problem. 

1 rorgot it. 

I rode up and knocked on the 
door. No answer. I used the dead 
girl’s key. It was the agreement. I 
forgot their violation — they forgot 
their houseman was supposed to go 
in with me. 

The room was empty. Two suit- 
cases, nothing in them. Closet 
empty. Dresser empty. Nothing in 
the bathroom. Bathtub not wet. 
Bed not slept in. The Gideon out on 
the bedside table, marker in at 
Isaiah. Marked passage: Chapter 
forty-one, verse twenty-four: Be- 
hold » ye are nothing. And your 
work a thing of nought; An abomi- 
nation is he that chooseth you. 

What did that mean? 

I went back down and asked 
there. The sister, apparently— the 
surviving one — had gone out at 
seven. She always went out at sev- 
en. She always came back at noon. 
They didn’t think she’d skipped. 

I asked them to give me a call 
and then I went over to the morgue. 
Doc was having a time. Our 
girl was still maintaining her nor- 
mal temperature — she was at 98.6 
and holding. She had no molars, no 
cavities. Teeth looked new, no 
wear. She had no appendix, which 
wasn’t that unusual. What was dis- 
tressing was she seemed to be lack- 
ing some sexual equipment and ac- 
cording to X-ray, she had multiple- 
chamber lungs and a unichamber 
heart. Blood was so far unclassi- 
fiable. 



“I don’t know what we have 
here,” Doc told me. It bothered 
him. He didn’t like mysteries. 

I went back to the bureau and 
did my part of the report and then I 
put in some time on a grocery store 
killing. That was going to get into 
the the unsolved files, too. 

But at noon I was back at the 
Mercury, knocking on that hotel 
room door again. 

S HE wasn’t more beautiful than, 
the dead one, but she wasn’t 
one bit less. I showed her my 
shield. She looked at it, confused, 
as if not knowing what it meant. 
But she smiled at me and let me in. 

I asked her name. 

“Andridida.” 

44 Want to spell that?” 

‘‘Alice, I mean,” she said. “It is 
Alice Smith.” 

“Where you from, Alice?” 
“Uh— ” 

“Who were you here with? Was 
it your sister?” 

“No, Tinna is . I mean 
Mary is just a friend.” 

“Your friend and you have the 
same name — and you’re not even 
sure what your name is? You don’t 
know where you come from. You 
runaways?” 

“Please. I’m sorry. I do not 
know a great deal. I’m here to 
learn. Would it be possible for you 
to’ explain whatever situation this 
may be?” 

I looked at her. You run into a 
lot of crazies. She didn’t look like 



92 



IF 




she was on anything. She was a 
great-looking girl. “Okay. You 
want to sit down?” 

“If you wish that of me,” she 
said and stretched out on the bed. 

“I said ‘sit,’ I’m on official busi- 
ness, girl.” 

“Oh? You mean in this 
position?” 

“Right. I’m a police detective. 
I’m here on business. I hate having 
to break it to you, but early this 
morning we found your friend in 
the park. She’d been attacked. Af- 
ter they finished with her they 
killed her.” 

“Oh.” 

“Oh? That’s all you have to 
say?” 

“I’m not facile with the lan- 
guage. Attacked? What does this 
mean?” 

“Violated, sexually violated. A 
man or men jumped her.” 

“Oh! And she wasn’t willing?” 
“We don’t know that, but the as- 
sumption is she wasn’t or they 
thought she wasn’t.” 

She seemed to be weighing that. 
“And what does ’killed’ mean?” 
“You’re kidding. It means depri- 
vation of life without the victim’s 
volition. She’s dead.” 

“Oh! Why didn’t you say that? 
Where is she? Please. Take me 
there. I have to see her. 

I figured about then she was a 
crazy, but that wasn’t illegal. 

I tried to prepare her on the ride. 
I tried to get across to her that her 
friend or whatever the dead girl 



had been to her wasn’t all that 
pretty to look at any more. She 
didn’t seem aware of what I was 
saying, didn’t seem to give a damn. 
She looked out through the car 
windows like a tourist on vacation 
in Fun City as we drove through 
the traffic. 

They hadn’t done the autopsy, 
just the preliminary report was in. 
Because of the irregularities Doc 
wanted some experts around for 
the carving. So the dead 
girl — Mary, call her — was in the 
drawer. Old Jinx, grouchy as ever, 
rolled it open for us. 

“Now just take it easy, huh,” I 
told Alice. 

I pulled the sheet down just 
enough so the face was clear, not 
the throat. 

“Hi,” Alice said to the body. 

T raised an eyebrow. Doc had 
come in with a couple of other 
people. It wasn’t often we had 
someone who looked like Mary on 
a slab or someone who looked like 
Alice visiting. 

“Alice. Is that your friend 
Mary?” I asked her. 

Alice went and just took the 
sheet out of my hand and pulled it 
down to the dead girl’s ankles. 
That rectangular navel stood out 
and hit you. She put her hand on 
the dead girl’s breast— a well made 
one — and then, frowning, reached 
up and touched the ripped neck. 

She said: “You dummy! Didn’t I 
tell you that you had to be care- 
ful?” Then, to me: “Did she violate

93 




some custom or hurt anything in 
your primitive society?” 

I didn’t believe it. 

“Oh, well.” She sighed. She 
opened her shoulder bag, got out a 
button just like the buttons I’d 
found on the dead girl. She shoved 
one button into the dead girl’s 
navel. 

I SAW it. Jinx saw it. Doc and the 
others saw part of it. The dead 
girl’s throat clamped together — it 
actually moved and then it healed. 
In ten seconds that throat was un- 
cut. Fifteen seconds and the girl sat 
up, shook her head, said: “Hi — ” 
to Alice and climbed right off that 
slab. 

“What were you up to, Tinna? 
You know how much trouble this is 
gonna cause.” 

“It was only a little mistake.” 
“Well, you apologize to these 
people and then you’re going to 
have to go right home,” 

I was bugeyed. I didn’t believe it. 
“Do I have to? Oh, come on, An- 
dridida. It’s wasn’t my fault. I just 
made a little mistake.” 

“You violated the rules and 
that’s the one thing you know 
you’re not allowed to do. Now you 
apologize to these people and we’ll 
just take you back and send you on 
home. When you grow up and are 
ready to behave responsibly maybe 
you can come back again. All 
right?” 

“I don’t want to go. I like it 
here.” 



“What. What happened last 
night?” I heard myself ask. I was 
talking to a dead girl — it occurred 
to me that she was a stiff. 

“Oh, hi,” she said to me. Big 
smile. “I don’t know, I was walk- 
ing through that nice area and sud- 
denly one of your people — ” 
“Took a fancy to you,” Alice 
whispered. 

“Took a fancy to me,” the dead 
girl informed me. 

“Took a fancy to you, did he? 
Did you see this person?” 

“Oh, it was really four persons, I 
think.” 

“You think. What did they look 
like?” 

“I can’t say, you know.” 

“You didn’t see their faces?” 
“Oh, I saw them. They were 
funny. All red-faced and real 
funny-looking. But I can’t tell you 
exactly. All of you look just alike 
to me.” 

“All of us look alike to you? 
Were they tall or short, white, 
black, Chinese, Puerto Rican?” 
“I’m very sorry, sir. But you see, 
I don’t know those things. They all 
looked the same to me, very 
funny.” 

“Funny. You didn’t happen to 
see which one cut your throat?” 
“Yes. I saw him, of course. But I 
couldn’t describe him or anything. 
He just looked likevyou.” 

“Like me?” 

“Or like him or those men. You 
ancients all look the same to me.” 
“Ancients.”

IF 




“We’re very sorry, sir. And we 
promise it won’t ever happen 
again. If we hurt anything or 
caused some irreparable damage to 
the fabric of your society you just 
tell me and I’ll see that it’s 
fixed — rectified — and just as good 
as newness,” Alice told me. “Now 
you, dummy. You come on. And 
when you get back you’d better not 
lie. You tell exactly what hap- 
pened. You know the damage you 
could wreak with something like 
this. Now, come on — right this 
minute!” 

Alice took the dead girl’s arm 
and the two of them just walked 
out. As an aside, the no longer 
dead girl was stark naked. 

I’m supposed to think 
quickly — I get paid for it — but I 
just stood aside and Jinx did and 
Doc did and the others did. 

It took me a full minute before I 
realized that the slab was empty 
and the dead girl was gone. 

I ran. 

The city can be pretty damned 
blase, but there were enough signs. 
There were two wrecked cars down 
at the corner. People were out and 
arguing in front of a grocery store. 
When I got to them they were yell- 
ing at each other about whether 
they’d just seen a stark naked 
beauty being hauled by her ear by 
another girl who was the equal of 
the naked one. 

I ran on, chased around, bumped 
into Blind Charlie. He’d seen 
them — he was only blind during 



working hours. He was on his 
lunch break. 

I raced on, tracked the girls 
across town, ignored the policing 
that should have been done in their 
wake. I almost cornered them as 
they headed into the park. Missed 
them by seconds. What happened 
to them then I have no idea. 

T HREE weeks later, about three 
o’clock in the morning, the 
buzzer went off. I’d just finished 
forty-eight hours straight of trying 
to save a kidnaped kid — I hadn’t. I 
crawled out of bed, got into my 
pants and dragged myself to the 
door. 

“Hi,” she said. 

She was wearing a see-through 
blouse and not much of a skirt and 
she had a deep tan all over. If she’d 
come to me to report getting raped 
in that getup I would have slapped 
her in jail for provocation. It was 
Alice. (I just thought — the only 
place the name was spoken was in 
my head.) 

“No,” she said. “My real name 
is Andridida. I’m sorry. You see, I 
made a mistake and they sent me 
back to rectify it. You were chosen 
as witness to the rectification.” 
“Yeah? What happened?” 

“Oh, she’s fine. You know. It 
was just that she was a dummy. 
Oh, you mean when you followed 
us? Well, we went to our place and 
then went home.” 

“You’d better come in. Where’s 
home?”

“It’s in the future and it’s on a 
distant planet. But we are de- 
scended from Earth Explorers, you 
know.’’ 

“How far in the future?’’ 

“Seven thousand three hundred 
and thirty-nine Earth years. But 
that’s not accurate — exactly — be- 
cause Earth changed about five 
thousand years ago or two thou- 
sand years from now. It’s a little 
confusing.” 

She looked around my ultra- 
modern apartment, a real futuristic 
place. 

“Quaint,” she told me. 

“How did you get Mary, Tinna 
whatever her name to heal that 
way?” 

“That’s the sort of thing I’m not 
supposed to tell you. Boy, did they 
ever give me hell. Tinna was always 
a dum-dum and they said they 
couldn’t really expect much more 
from her, but what happened was 
my fault and so they sent me back 
to rectify and not cause any more 
trouble. Okay?” 

“What are you going to rectify?” 

“Well, those boys who took the 
fancy to Tinna. They can’t be. 
Anachronism is okay but bad ones 
simply aren’t acceptable. So we 
have to attend to them.” 

“We have to attend to them? 
How? You know how many young 
punks are floating around this city 
and how many older ones? Did 
your friend give you any 
description?” 

“No. She’s a dummy. She really 



thinks you all look the same. But 
there’s a way. Here. I have a list.” 
She opened her purse and gave 
me a fifty-page notebook. Every bit 
and piece of paper front and back 
was covered with tiny writing. She 
spelled badly. The way I saw it, 
most of the terms applied to 
electrical equipment. 

“If this wasn’t such a mess now I 
think I’d just go out and steal 
it — but, boy, would they ever give 
me hell if I did that and got caught 
or something. So, I’ve just been 
and I priced all the things I could 
find and in your money I need al- 
most exactly ten million dollars. 
So, if you’ll just give it to me I’ll 
rectify this and then everything will 
be all right again.” 

“Ten million dollars?” 

“Yes. Is that a lot?” 

“Well, it’s more than I have.” 
“Oh. I was certain you’d have 
it.” 

“’Fraid not. Sorry.” 

“Well. We can’t do it without 
the apparatus, you know.” 

“Couldn’t you make it for a hun- 
dred and twenty-five dollars? I 
have that.” 

“No. Ten million is the amount I 
need. Wait. Let me think for a 
minute.” 

She stood there, beautiful, 
maybe more beautiful with that 
puzzled, pensive^ little-girl look. 
And then she just dematerialized. 
She was there, right in front of me, 
and then she wasn’t there any 
more.

IF 




T HREE weeks after that I was 
collaring a pusher down on a 
Hundred and Forty-second. The 
pusher’s neighbors didn’t like him 
but liked me less. There were circl- 
ing and closing in on me. Their 
faces weren’t angry — they were 
stolid. They didn’t even have to 
whip up their feelings about getting 
me. They knew they had me. And I 
knew the only way I’d get out was 
shoot my way out. With the politi- 
cians and the department scared to 
death of the newspapers and every- 
one else, I had a choice of being 
stomped to death right out of the 
department or shooting my way 
out and getting heaved out of the 
job for that. 

Me and my pusher were in the 
center of the ring. I didn’t see any 
way out. They didn’t care if I got 
some of them. I was a cop and they 
hated cops. 

“Hi.” 

She was there with me. Where 
she came from, I don’t know. “I 
can do it for a hundred and twenty- 
five dollars. Will you give it to me 
now, please?” 

“These citizens want to kill me,” 
I explained. 

“Oh?” She turned and smiled at 
them all, “I don’t think you should 
kill Mike. It’s not nice. Now all of 
you go home.” 

They didn’t believe it. There was 
this gorgeous piece of meat, almost 
all of it on view — this kid, this 
piece of fluff. And she was telling 
them. 



She shook her finger at them. 
“You go home right away or I’m 
going to get good and mad,” she 
told them. They didn’t even know 
what the hell she was talking about. 
She turned to me as if they were 
taken care of already. “Do you 
have the money? The sooner you 
give it to me the faster this is going 
to get done.” 

I watched them. She had magic 
buttons. If they got me I didn’t 
have anything but health insurance. 

“Don’t worry about these 
people. They’re all going home. 
Now!” She clapped her hands. A 
whole gang of them had been grim, 
mean, bent on bending me, but 
suddenly every face there took on 
an idiotic grin. They were smiling. 
Some of them — probably for .the 
first time in their lives when not 
turned on— giggled. Like jolly 
zombies they turned and walked 
away. 

“You see? You have to trust me. 
Now. The money. Please.” 

I tried breathing again. I was 
still alive. That was when a patrol 
car idled up. They had probably 
been sleeping it off in some al- 
ley — great police force we have. I 
turned my pusher over to them and 
then I took Andridida’s arm — it 
was very warm and the skin was 
baby soft. We got into my car and I 
didn’t even question her. I just 
drove us to the bank, told her to 
wait, walked in and emptied my ac- 
count, brought out the money and 
gave it to her.

“Oh, good. Now, please. You 
have to tell me where I can find 
a — ” she stopped and seemed to 
think about it — “bookie joint and 
then a crap game and do they have 
roulette?” 

That was what she wanted to 
know. I told her. East Side Eddie 
ran a floating crap game. She could 
find him either in the furnace room 
of P.S. 147 or behind the 16th Pre- 
cinct, in a garage there. Loose-lip- 
ped Louis was the bookie. He ran a 
candy store on 86th Street. As far 
as roulette, there was a casino over 
in Fort Lee. 

“Okay,” she said, accepting. 
“And please don’t worry. I know I 
made a mistake, but I promise I’ll 
rectify it.” 

“Yeah,” I said. 

She didn’t vanish. She just got 
out of the car and walked away. 

But I didn’t Jose her. 

T HE reports came in and I saw 
them. 

East Side Eddie and all his 
friends were flat busted. All they 
remembered was that, even switch- 
ing dice, they couldn’t stop her. 
She came in, asked them how to 
play the game and then she rolled 
whatever they told her would win. 
According to East Side Eddie, who 
was found weeping in a bar over on 
Third Avenue by a gambling squad 
detective, they switched her onto 
dice that were so loaded the aver- 
age guy wasn’t strong enough to 
pick them up. 



The next report was on Loose- 
lipped Louis. They found him in an 
alley. He’d been worked over and 
worked over hard. He kept mum- 
bling, “Please, girlie. Please, 
girlie.” 

She’d come in and put her win- 
nings on the least likely pair of 
nags in the history of flat racing. 
The horses were so old and feeble 
they weren’t even allowed on a de- 
cent track. Neither one of them 
had ever finished better than last 
and twenty furlongs behind the 
pack. Glue factories and ice 
wagons used better. But there was 
a quote on them and Andridida 
walked in, put her ten thousand 
dollars on them (presumably the 
money gained from East Side Ed- 
die and his pals) and they paid 408 
to one. That should have given her 
four million and eighty thousand 
dollars. Loose-lipped Louis — a 
grade-school dropout — could not 
even imagine such a sum. He of- 
fered to give her back her money 
and invited her to come up to his 
place to see his Danish picture 
books. Andridida had a fit. She 
took him out in the alley-and man- 
handled — really strong-armed him. 
Then she escorted him around 
town to collect. The best he could 
come up with was ten per cent. She 
took the four hundred thou but 
parted with Loose-lipped in an al- 
ley where she finished her ex- 
pression of unhappiness with wel- 
chers. Knocked his teeth out, every 
one.

IF 




It wasn’t a surprise. I heard the 
story and decided to keep the radio 
on. Presently the story came over 
the' speaker: “Unidentified, beau- 
tiful young girl machine-gunned by 
gangsters. ’’ She had been walk- 
ing down 16th Street and a dark 
limousine had cruised up. A sub- 
machine gun had spoken and the 
bullets had cut her down. 

I drove like crazy to get there. 
The whole machinery of the law 
was there: the squad, the ambu- 
lance, the medical examiners, the 
witnesses, the crowd. I held my 
shield out front and just walked 
through. Those bullets had really 
gotten her. She was as riddled as 
any shooting victim I’d ever seen. I 
just elbowed through to her. The 
precinct captain was there. He 
wasn’t my friend. He asked what 
the hell I was doing on his turf. 

I told him to just take it easy. 
“It’s a special case. She’s a friend.’’ 
“Oh,” he said, pretending to 
have a human concern. “Sorry 
about it, Mike.’’ 

“Don’t worry, huh? Her purse 
around?'’ 

“Yeah. Why?’’ 

“Let me see it for a minute, will 
you?’’ 

He got a detective to fetch it for 
me. It was new, almost empty — but 
there were those buttons. I pulled 
one out. 

“What are you doing?’’ 

I knelt beside her and peeled 
back the shroud. If she’d worn any 
more clothes I couldn’t have gotten 



to it, but before they grabbed me 
and hauled me back I crammed the 
thing into her navel. 

It didn’t take more than thirty 
seconds — and half her head had 
been blown away, too. She regrew 
the half of head while the cops 
stopped holding me to watch. Then 
she sat up, blinked those big eyes of 
hers, smiled that smile she had and 
said. “Hi.’’ 

They were all speechless. They 
also seemed paralyzed. I just left 
her there and them with her and 
walked away from it. 

T RICKS again. By the time I 
got to my car, she was already 
in it. “You know,’’ she told me. “I 
think Mr. Loose-lipped Louis did 
that. It wasn’t at all nice.’’ 
“Yeah,’’ I said. 

“I’ll fix him,’’ she informed me. 
“Yeah,’’ I said. (As it worked 
out, she did fix him. Guys who’d 
never beat him suddenly couldn’t 
miss. He turned loser, finally 
Found God or at least sanctuary in 
some monastic order. So because 
of her a monastery has a Brother 
Loose-lipped Louis.) 

“Come on. I have almost a half a 
million and I only need nine and a 
half million more.’’ 

“Uh-huh.’’ 

She insisted and I wasn’t going 
to cross her.

plained the game to her and as 
soon as she had it she decided to 
ask that the limit be raised. She 
wanted to get it on two spins. The 
manager didn’t trust even his rig- 
ged wheel that much. He let her bet 
a thousand at a spin. She liked nine 
black. And, not surprising me, that 
little ball couldn’t resist it. Nine 
black came up ten times running 
and that was it. That was all the 
money they had. 

She had a tantrum, called them 
cheats and bad sports and was just 
working her way into turning them 
into frogs or something when I de- 
cided it was wiser to haul her out. 

So she went on with the tantrum 
at me. She was still short of her 
first million. Didn’t I want the rec- 
tification? Didn’t I have any inter- 
est in it? Didn’t I want to help her? 
Wasn’t I her friend? 

“Now, look. You’ve taken less 
than twelve hours. You’ve ruined 
the biggest floating crap game in 
this city. You busted and beat up 
our most important bookie. You 
wiped out this casino and you got 
killed once. That’s plenty for one 
day.” 

“But I have to get the money. I 
can’t do it without money. How am 
I going to get the money?” 

“Find an oil field or uranium 
mine or something.” 

“Are those things worth 
anything?” 

“They’re worth something.” 
“How? I mean, where should I 
find them?” 



“Well, it would be best if you 
owned the land. Find the oil or the 
uranium or gold if you want, buy 
the land and then sell it.” 

“Should I find it in any special 
place?” 

“Probably someplace where the 
land is cheap and not too 
developed.” 

“Where is the land cheap?” 

“Deserts, maybe remote 
mountains.” 

“I should find a lot of this oil or 
uranium or gold?” 

“A lot would be better.” 

“Okay. Thank you, Mike. I 
really do appreciate your help, you 
know,” she told me and off she 
went. 

The story didn’t make the pa- 
pers in the morning and didn’t 
even get into the evening papers. 
But the next morning’s headlines 
announced: largest mineral de- 
posits IN NORTH AMERICA. The 
early reports were, of course, 
typically inaccurate. The evening 
paper set it straight: largest min- 
eral DEPOSITS ON EARTH DISCOV- 
ERED. 

Interestingly, she was a cheap- 
skate. She had found the cheapest 
land in the country and then she 
bought hardly any of it. And the 
stuff was arranged like pipelines 
right down to the core. One pipe 
was oil, one natural gas, one ura- 
nium, one gold, one silver, one cop- 
per and more. 

She got her ten million and then 
some.

IF 




I HAVE a one-bedroom apart- 
ment in an old building. The 
movers had had trouble bringing 
my ninety-inch sofa up on the 
freight elevator and the floor’s so 
ancient it isn’t sturdy enough for a 
waterbed. 

They had put Andridida’s gadget 
on a great flatbed truck — a gadget 
maybe the size of a small house. It 
had taken a couple of giant cranes 
and two teams of loaders. And then 
with an escort they somehow got it 
across town and to my freight en- 
trance. There they checked the ad- 
dress again and started cursing and 
swearing and yelling. That was 
when little Andridida walked up. 
She touched the monster gadget, 
waited for it to reduce itself in 
size, then picked it up with one 
hand and carried it up to my place. 

Ten million dollars’ worth of 
that game went on. Even after all 
the paraphernalia had been shrunk 
to little and very little I could 
barely squeeze into my place after 
a while. But all the deliveries were 
finally made and she clapped her 
hands, satisfied. But her happiness 
lasted only five minutes. She 
turned morose. I asked her what 
the problem was. She needed a 
screwdriver. 

What I produced wasn’t what 
she wanted but she decided it would 
have to do. I offered to help but 
wasn’t much help. The two of us 
sat on the floor and I watched 
while she worked. I had no idea 
what the devil she was making, but 



when it was finished it was about a 
six feet square. She talked to it or 
did something to it and it dutifully 
shriveled up and came down to 
about the size of a cassette 
recorder. 

That pleased her. She was 
happy. She smiled at me. 

So we took her ten-million-dol- 
lar toy and went to the park to the 
bushes where we’d found Mary or 
Tinna or whatever the other girl’s 
name. We sat there cross-legged 
and she flipped on her machine. 

I screamed. There was a Bronto- 
saurus standing on my foot. She 
said, “Sorry,” and the Bronto- 
saurus went away. She made some 
sort of adjustment. I kept myself 
from yelling, but I drew my service 
revolver. We were surrounded by 
these four slope-headed hairy guys 
bearing animal skins with clubs in 
their hands. They went away. It 
was a long process. We were under 
water twice — once we were con- 
fronted by a sharklike creature. 
Later a gang of Indians came after 
us. It was just one thing after an- 
other. Happily, she turned off most 
of the things pretty quick. But she 
was a voyeur or whatever the fe- 
male equivalent and from the first 
slopehead with his girl, through the 
Indian bucks and maids, through 
Nieuw Amsterdam’s guys and 
girls, through the British couples, 
the Colonial ones, the guys and 
dolls. Well, for the first time 
in my life I wondered whether the 
place really wasn’t Fun City. That 



SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL POLICE 



101 




copse of bushes had to be the sex 
capital of the world and Andridida 
just loved it. I was a little embar- 
rassed by it, myself. 

Finally, after a hell of a long 
time, along came Tinna or Mary or 
whatever her name. 

“Ah-ha,” Andridida said and we 
watched the shocking rape murder 
in perfect focus and detail. 

W HEN the act was over and the 
punks ran off we followed 
them — somehow. Andridida car- 
ried the machine and we just 
traipsed after the guys, I guess. It 
was a little confusing because it 
wasn’t really then but it was now 
and so — going into the IRT, for ex- 
ample — we occupied real space but 
the four punks were just walking 
right through people. 

We subwayed after them and 
then followed the punks up the 
steps and out into what hadn’t been 
a good neighborhood, ever. As it 
worked out, as we came up, the 
four of them were standing in front 
of a pornographic bookstore. They 
were standing on top of themselves. 

“There they are,” Andridida 
said, clearly pleased. She switched 
off the machine. The four of them 
really were there, no double image. 

Andridida walked right up to 
them and said, “Hi.” 

I was right behind her. 

They saw me and they said, 
“Cop!” 

They started to take off. I didn’t 
even think to draw on them. For 



what? They had raped and mur- 
dered somebody who wasn’t or 
hadn’t been or had been buttoned 
out of it. What kind of crime was 
it? Anyway, it was Andridida’s 
rectification. 

The way I heard it, it really was 
a zap sound. 

They were gone. Their clothes 
and shoes were just in puddles on 
that filthy street. 

I turned to her, shrugged one 
more time. “Do I ask what hap- 
pened to them?” 

“They’re being rectified. Yeah,” 
she said nodding. 

“So then, that’s it?” 

“Yes. I think so, unless I made 
another mistake. But I don’t think 
I did.” 

“Well, that’s nice. You wouldn’t 
want to leave me your machine, 
would you?” 

“1 don’t think I’m allowed.” 

“Oh.” 

“Well, it was very nice knowing 
you and I hope you’ll forgive any 
problems I may have caused you.” 

“Nothing at all. My pleasure.” 

She stuck out her hand. I shook 
it. “Goodbye, Mike. I looked you 
up.” 

“Did you?” 

“Everything’s all right for you. 
It works out.” 

“Good to know. Thanks. 
Andridida.” 

She smiled and turned and 
walked away. I watched her until 
she rounded the corner. One hell of 
a girl. •

IF 




I F OLD-VALUE science fiction 
is on its way out nobody over at 
Doubleday seems to know it yet. In 
the past few months, the publishers 
have issued five giant volumes of 
older stories, at a total cost to the 
readers of $45.75! Unless publish- 
ers are losing their market sense, 
there must be a growing demand 
for fiction that was written before 
the new-value concept was devel- 
oped fully in our field. 

By old-value stories, I mean 
those that were essentially meant 
to entertain, where the emphasis 
was on story rather than on style dr 
relevancy to any current situ- 
ation — stories that tended to as- 
sume an expanding universe of 
man’s destiny. These might be 
called reader-oriented stories, since 
they were written for the general 



reader, with no thought of appeal- 
ing to the regular literary critics. 
The new-value stories, of course, 
are those which develop science fic- 
tion according to the current liter- 
ary and mainstream values, with 
style and significance given tnore 
emphasis than story. (We need 
some handy labels. But the new 
and old “wave” labels are so in- 
volved with emotional overtones 
and quasi-political feuds that they 
have become almost worthless.) 

One of these anthologies issued 
by Doubleday has been eagerly an- 
ticipated for some time, though its 
present form is something of a sur- 
prise. This is The Science Fiction 
Hall of Fame , edited by Ben Bova, 
made up of novellas. But instead of 
the expected single volume, we 
have two — Volume Two A and 




Volume Two B, at $9.95 each. 

The first volume of this series 
covered the shorter stories, and 1 
considered it the finest single book 
of science fiction ever published, 
justifying its claim to be the “great- 
est of all time.” The two new 
volumes make the same claim for 
the novellas, and the stories are 
certainly excellent. But I find I 
have very mixed reactions to the 
current books as an equal to the 
former superlative anthology. 

Much of the value of the first 
Hall of Fame came from a logical 
arrangement of stories according 
to their year of publication — that 
year clearly indicated. This enabled 
the reader to fix himself in time 
v and to get a clear perspective on 
the story in terms of the progress of 
the field. Any crudities in an early 
story could be easily understood 
and allowances therefore made. 
But here, for some reason (or lack 
of it), this logical approach has 
been abandoned. There is no dis- 
cernible pattern, which strikes me' 
as a rather careless way to deal 
with volumes meant to be 
definitive. 

The rationale behind the selec- 
tion of some stories and the use of 
two volumes for the novellas is 
sometimes also hard to discover. 
These stories were supposedly se- 
lected via voting by the members of 
the Science Fiction Writers of 



America under conditions govern- 
ing the selection of Nebula win- 
ners — e.g., these works would have 
merited the SFWA Nebula award, 
had that award existed when the 
stories were published. Or so I was 
told. In editing the first volume, 
Robert Silverberg followed this 
concept as closely as possible, list- 
ing the main votes and giving his 
reasons for the few deviations. 

Ben Bova also lists the top ten 
novellas chosen by the SFWA 
members. Eight of these are in- 
cluded in the A volume. A Walter 
Miller story is omitted necessarily 
because rights were not available, 
and one of the two Heinlein stories 
is dropped to avoid having more 
than one story by each author. (I 
find myself unsure of the wisdom 
of this; I rather think the best sto- 
ries should be used in any* list of 
“greatest,” even if half of them are 
by the same writer.) However, the 
top-rated ten authors are also 
listed, which adds only Poul An- 
derson to the list. His highest- 
choice novella is therefor added to 
Volume A. Fine, we now have nine 
stories. And probably the tenth ex- 
pected story could, have been the 
next highest choice below the top 
ten already mentioned. Maybe it 
is — but we don’t know; there are 
two other novellas in Volume A 
and eleven stories in Volume B. 
These are good stories, but was it 



104 



IF 




really necessary to have a second 
volume? And if so, shouldn’t the 
listing of top stories and top writers 
have been extended to show us 
why? 

I also feel less than happy about 
the inclusion of H. G. Wells’ The 
Time Machine in Volume A. True, 
it’s a great classic. But the fact re- 
mains that it first appeared at a 
time when not only was there no 
SFWA — but when there could 
have been no SFWA, because there 
was no regular field for science fic- 
tion writers. I don’t know about 
this. In fact, 1 wind up with more 
uncertainties about the choices 
than certainties. 

Volume Two A contains: Call 
Me Joe, by Poul Anderson; Who 
Goes There? by John W. Camp- 
bell; Nerves , by Lester del Rey; 
Universe , by Robert A. Heinlein; 
The Marching Morons , by C. M. 
Kornbluth; Vintage Season , by 
Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore; 

A nd Then There Were None , 
by Eric Frank Russell; The Ballad 
of Lost CMell, by Cordwainer 
Smith; Baby Is Three, by Theodore 
Sturgeon; The Time Machine , by 
H. G. Wells and With Folded 
Hands, by Jack Williamson. That’s 
a good list of stories, and well 
worth the price. Volume B also has 
excellent stories, but since these are 
apparently second-choice stories 
for this purpose, I suggest you look 



at the table of contents when you 
see the book and decide for your- 
self whether you want to spend the 
money. (The Introduction is identi- 
cal for both volumes, incidentally.) 

I think it might have been better 
to restrict the novellas to the single 
volume originally planned; that 
might have had more effect in de- 
fining the best of our longer works 
than this vaguely demarcated 
double volume. (Also, perhaps then 
the author advance might not have 
been restricted to Vi $ per word — a 
low rate which seems very curious 
for a project of the SFWA — an or- 
ganization that is supposed to be 
devoted to raising rates in our field. 
Since this advance is against royal- 
ties, it probably doesn’t matter; but 
half the usual advance doesn’t look 
good for a professional organiza- 
tion of this type!) 

Happily, Doubleday has done a 
much better job with the dust 
jacket this time, and the books are 
both more dignified and easier to 
read than the psychedelic mon- 
strosity on Volume One. 

^ HE Astounding- Analog Read - 
er, edited by Harry Harrison 
and Brian W. Aldiss, is another 
two-volume anthology (at $7.95 
per volume) from Doubleday. The 
first volume contains fifteen sto- 
ries, beginning with 1932 and end- 



READING ROOM 



105 




ing with 1946. The second volume 
had twenty-one stories, 1947 to 
1965 — all from Astounding and 
Analog, of course. The stories are 
arranged by date of publication, 
with a general introduction and 
separate introductions for each 
group of three stories. 

The selections here were made 
by Harrison and Aldiss, without 
any voting by larger groups. Yet 
they don’t suffer by comparison 
with the SFWA lists. Surprisingly, 
there were almost no duplicates be- 
tween these volumes and the Hall 
of Fame ones; only Anderson’s 
Call Me Joe and Moore and Ku- 
ttner’s Vintage Season are shared. 
(And only two shorter stories are 
shared with the earlier Hall of 
Fame volume.) 

Looking at the Harrison-Aldiss 
table of contents, it’s hard to see 
how some of the stories were not 
selected by the SFWA: Forgetful- 
ness, by Don A. Stuart — perhaps 
the ultimate romantic statement of 
man’s destiny; Farewell to the 
Master, by Harry Bates; By His 
Bootstraps, by Robert A. Hein- 
lein — the most complex of all time- 
travel stories; City, by Clifford D. 
Simak; Child’s Play, by William 
Tenn — and a great many others 
that are genuinely classic in qual- 
ity. There are a number of stories 
that I probably would not have se- 
lected — and a few I’d like to see 



here; but it is a list of stories that I 
can only consider outstanding. 

Probably by the nature of the 
magazines covered and my own 
taste, I like the first volume better 
than the second — but only by a 
narrow margin. 

I’d strongly recommend the 
Harrison-Aldiss volumes to anyone 
looking to see what made — and 
makes — science fiction wonderful. 
And if I had to choose between the 
two-volume SFWA set and the 
two-volume Harrison-Aldiss an- 
thology, I’d tend to take the lat- 
ter — I’d also save a few dollars, 
though that is incidental. Harrison 
and Aldiss have done a fine job of 
selecting and explaining the things 
that made Astounding I Analog a 
leader for so long! 

T HE fifth huge volume from 
Doubleday deals with the work 
of an even earlier period of maga- 
zine fiction than the other antholo- 
gies. This goes^all the way back to 
original science fiction published in 
the magazines in 1930 and 1932. It 
is Anthology : Three Novels, by 
John W. Campbell (Doubleday, 
$9.95). All the stories Campbell 
wrote about the characters Arcot, 
Wade and Morey are included fi- 
nally in this one volume — and a 
big, fat volume it is. 

I’ve already discussed the stories 
in an introduction to the book and 



106 



IF 




there’s a bonus introduction by 
Isaac Asimov. But this is the type 
of fiction that is almost certainly 
anathema to the literary among 
us — and dearly beloved by the rest 
of us, though it is now far in our 
background. Campbell took the 
story of man’s physical mastery of 
science and his conquest of space as 
far as it could go. He piled wonder 
on wonder, until no more was pos- 
sible. Back in 1932, he reached the 
ultimate limit of even such modern 
ideas as psi power. The effect defi- 
nitely isn’t literary — but man, how 
it moves! And I still find it fun to 
read. 

The stories are almost legendary 
now. I’m delighted to know they 
are finally in a permanent form I 
can keep and browse through once 
in a while. Nobody writes stories 
like that now. Perhaps nobody 
should, to be honest — but I’4n glad 
Campbell wrote them once, for all 
time! 

T HE other anthology and col- 
lection of good-old-days mate- 
rial are mercifully already in soft 
covers and hence less expensive. 
Science Fiction: the Great Years, 
edited by Carol & Frederik Pohl 
(Ace, $1.25) is a most welcome ad- 
dition to all the huge volumes. I’m 
delighted with it particularly for 
two reasons; first, it brought Carol 
Pohl — Fred’s most attractive 



wife — into the reading group of 
fans — she makes a welcome addi- 
tion to the book’s tone. And sec- 
ond, it brings Raymond Z. Gal- 
lun’s remarkable Old Faithful back 
to us, among the other excellent 
stories included. 

To a very large extent, three 
writers were responsible for science 
fiction as we know it. Two of 
them — John W. Campbell under 
the Don A. Stuart byline and Stan- 
ley G. Weinbaum — get and deserve 
credit for their influence on the 
field. But Ray Gallun began mov- 
ing toward the “Golden Age’’ of 
science fiction before them and he 
was one of the best early “living 
proofs” that science-fiction writers 
could handle real feeling and emo- 
tion. When his Old Faithful first 
appeared in 1934, it attracted more 
attention than any story of its 
length for the year. And it still 
stands up after all this time. The 
yarn is no longer novel — too many 
other writers have since taken off 
from Gallun’s inspiration — but it is 
just as fine to me as it always was. 
It is about time that some antholo- 
gist gave the attention to the story 
that it richly deserves. 

A NOTHER writer who did 
some of the best-liked stories 
in the good old days was Ross 
Rocklynne. His The Men and the 
Mirror (Ace, 95tf) is a collection of 



READING ROOM 



107 




related stories. Most of these fea- 
ture puzzles — men find themselves 
in situations where something is 
cockeyed and dangerous and work 
their way out by making the effort 
to understand their strange envi- 
ronment. The five stories in the 
book are all good examples of this. 

Curiously, my own favorite isn’t 
included — though it is listed on the 
copyright page. This is And Then 
There Was One , which I have al- 
ways considered the best story of 
its kind ever done in science fiction. 
If Ace decided to omit it because of 
the length of the book, I think it 
was a serious mistake. But even 
without it the book is worth the 
price. 

W E DON’T have to turn only 
to the past to discover old- 
value fiction, however. Fortunately 
some of the writers who loved to 
read the older stories are writing 
them today. Romance is not wholly 
dead — some of us still love the leg- 
endary Mars of Percival Lowell, 
even though Burroughs is dead and 
Leigh Brackett isn’t writing about 
it any more. 

The Man Who Loved Mars, by 
Lin Carter (Fawcett, 750) is in the 
grand tradition of such romance. 
Here are the dryland tribes with 
their exotic barbarian cultures, the 
ancient cities crumbling into slow 
and fabulous decay, the legends 



from the days of old and the few 
Earthmen who can exist among 
them. But Carter hasn’t completely 
neglected what we have learned of 
the planet from our space shots. He 
may have given us an atmosphere 
denser than the latest theories — but 
it’s an atmosphere that is much less 
dense than that of Barsoom. There 
are still two moons in the sky — but 
logically so tiny that they can’t be 
seen without exact knowledge and 
luck. And there’s a certain bitter- 
ness about the contact of Earthman 
and Martian that comes off very 
well indeed. 

Carter also captures the color 
and feeling of the planet as readers 
know it, the little touches that 
bring the romance of far-off worlds 
home to us. And the mystery of 
Martians who look like Earthman 
isn’t thrown aside, but becomes 
part of the plot. 

This is by all odds the best show- 
case of Carter’s writing I have 
seen. For this type of story, his 
people move naturally. The color 
he evolves for his world is tradi- 
tional, but he has made it very 
much his own. And the book hangs 
together. It’s Carter’s best to date, 
in my opinion, and I heartily rec- 
ommend it. 

O NE of the old values was that 
of honestly trying to please and 
satisfy the reader. Old-value fiction 



108 



IF 




demands that the writer assume 
that there is no obligation on the 
part of his reader to understand, 
appreciate or finish the story— the 
obligation is on the writer to pay 
the reader back for the investment 
of time and money. 

Without this sense of values no 
amount of borrowing backgrounds 
and methods can do an adequate 
job of recreating the type of adven- 
ture fiction many readers still 
demand. 

At the Narrow Passage , by 
Richard C. Meredith (Putnam, 
$5.95), seems to be the beginning of 
a good adventure novel. It isn’t. 

Among the best of the adventure 
writers, up to the time of his regret- 
table death, was H. Beam Piper, 
who built a complex society around 
the discovery of Paratime. The 
Paratime stories involved a sort of 
side-by-side time sequence — mil- 
lions of alternate todays could be 
reached. Meredith dedicates his 
book to the memory of Piper and 
the multiple worlds of Paratime. 
He’s honest abput his use of a 
similar background, happily. And 
I agree with him that there is 
much room for further adventure 
fiction in Piper's worlds. 

The novel begins well, too, 
though the intrustion of nonhu- 
mans into Paratime is something I 
found somewhat hard to take. (The 
general usefulness of the rule of 



“one assumption, and no more’’ is 
worth noting.) But generally this 
one began to shape up as a good ac- 
tion story, with our hero — and her- 
oine — moving into tighter and 
tighter jams. I enjoyed it until 

Well, I began to worry when 
only ten pages were left, but I kept 
hoping for something clever. Five 
more pages and I began to lose that 
hope. And then I hit the last page. 
Our hero and heroine had been 
caught between two forces, gradu- 
ally coming at them from both 
sides. So, they’re stranded. And let 
me quote the last three sentences: 

“Someone, somehow, must stop 
this hell before it destroys billions 
upon billions of human beings 
across the Lines and all the mag- 
nificient civilizations we’ve built. 
And if nobody else will do it, I 
guess it’ll be up to Sally and me. 
But damned if / know how (Ital- 
ics mine.) 

I don’t care if a sequel is planned 
or not. I wouldn’t read it if it came 
out, since such dishonesty, such to- 
tal lack of story value as that 
unending, means I can’t trust the 
writer ever again. 

It’s damned bad writing, and 
even worse editing— if the editor 
bothered to read it before buying it. 
Don’t be cheated! Both old-value 
and new-value writing deserve their 
readers — but no-value writing like 
that deserves only contempt. •

Westwind.” 

One wall of the steaming, 
stinking room began to wa- i 
ver, the magic portal that had 
opened upon a garden of al- 
most inconceivable beauty 
beginning to mist and 
change. Fountains of marble 
waved like grass, and rose 
trees, whose flowery branches 
wore strands of pearl and dia- 
mond, faded to soft old val- j 
entines. The ruler’s chair 
turned to bronze, then to um- 
ber, and the ruler himself, fa- 
therly and cunning, wise and 
unknowable, underwent a 
succession of transforma- i 
tions, becoming at first a pic- 
ture, then a poster and at last 
a postage stamp. 

THHE lame old woman who ran 
* the place turned the wall off 
and several people protested. “You 
heard what he said,” she told them. 
“You know your duty. Why do you 
have to listen to some simpleton 
from the Department of Truth say 
everything over in longer words 
and spread his spittle on it?” 

The protesters, having registered 
their postures, were silent. The old 
woman looked at the clock behind 



no 



the tiny bar she served. 

“Game in twenty minutes,” she 
said. “Folks will be coming in then, 
rain or no rain, wanting drinks. 
You want some, you better get 
them now.” 

Only two did: hulking, dirty men 
who might have been of any dis- 
honest trade. A few people were al- 
ready discussing the coming game. 
A few others talked about the ad- 
dress they had just heard— not its 
content, which could not have 
meant much to most of them — but 
about the ruler and his garden, ex- 
changing at hundredth hand bits of 
palace gossip of untold age. The 
door opened and the storm came in 
and a young man with it. 

He was tall and thin. He wore a 
raincoat that had soaked through 
and an old felt hat covered with a 
transparent plastic protection 
whose elastic had forced the hat's 
splayed brim into a tight bell 
around his head. One side of the 
young man's face was a blue 
scar — the old woman asked him 
what he wanted. 

“You have rooms,” he said. 

“Yes, we do. Very cheap, too. 
You ought to wear something over 
that.” 

“If it bothers you,” he said, 
“don't look at it.” 

“You think I’ve got to rent to 
you?'' She looked around at her 
customers, lining up support, 



should the young man with the scar 
decide to resent her remarks. “All 
I’ve got to do if you complain is say 
we’re full. You can walk to the po- 
lice station then — it’s twenty 
blocks-^and maybe they’ll let you 
sleep in a cell.” 

“I’d like a room and something 
to eat. What do you have?” 

“Ham sandwich,” she said. She 
named a price. “Your room — ” 
She named another. 

“All right,” he said. “I’d like 
two sandwiches. And coffee.” 

“The room is only half if you 
share with somebody — if you want 
me to I can yell out and see if any- 
body wants to split.” 

“No.” 

She ripped the top from a can of 
coffee. The handle popped out and 
the contents began to steam. She 
gave it to him and said, “I guess 
they won’t take you in the other 
places, huh? With that face.” 

¥JTE TURNED away from her, 
* -^sipping his coffee, looking the 
room over. The door by which he 
had just entered (water still 
streamed from his coat and he 
could feel it in his shoes, sucking 
and gurgling with his every move- 
ment) opened again and a blind girl 
came in. 

He saw that she was blind before 
he saw anything else about her. She 
wore black glasses, which on that

impenetrable, rain-wracked night 
would have been clue enough, and 
as she entered she looked (in the 
second most terrible and truest 
sense) at Nothing. 

The old woman asked, “Where 
did you come from?” 

“From the terminal,” the girl 
said. “1 walked.” She carried a 
white cane, which she swung before 
her as she sidled toward the sound 
of the old woman. 

“I need a place to sleep,” the girl 
said. 

Her voice was clear and sweet 
and the young man decided that 
even before the rain had scrubbed 
her face she hadn’t worn makeup. 

He said, “You don’t want to stay 
here. I’ll call you a cab.” 

“I want to stay here,” the girl 
said in her clear voice. “I have to 
stay somewhere.” 

“I tfave a communicator,” the 
young man said. He opened his 
coat to show it to her — a black box 
with a speaker, keys and a tiny 
screen — then realized that he had 
made a fool of himself. Someone 
laughed. 

“They’re not running.” * 

The old woman said, “What’s 
not running?” 

“The cabs. Or the buses. There’s 
high water in a lot of places all over 
the city and they’ve been shorting 
out. I have a communicator, 
too — ” the blind girl touched her 



waist — “and the ruler made a 
speech just a few minutes ago. I lis- 
tened to him as I walked and there 
was a newscast afterward. But I 
knew anyway because a gentleman 
tried to call one for me from the 
terminal, but they wouldn’t come.” 
“You shouldn't stay here,” the 
young man said. 

The old woman said, “I got a 
room if you want it — the only one 
left.” 

“I want it,” the girl told her. 
“You’ve got it. Wait a minute 
now — I’ve got to fix this fellow 
some sandwiches.” 

Someone swore at the old 
woman and said that the game was 
about to start. 

“Five minutes yet.” She took a 
piece of boiled ham from under the 
counter and put it between two 
slices of bread, then repeated the 
process. 

The young man said, “These 
look eatable. Not fancy, but eat- 
able. Would you like one?” 

“I have a little money,” the blind 
girl said. “I can pay for my own.” 
And to the old woman: “I would 
like some coffee.” 

“How about a sandwich?” 

“I’m too tired to eat.”

the storm and splashed in to watch 
the game. The old woman turned 
the wall on and they crowded near 
it, watching the pre-game warmup, 
practicing and perfecting the in- 
tentness they would use on the 
game itself. The scarred young 
man and the blind girl were edged 
away and found themselves nearest 
the door in a room now grown very 
silent save for the sound from the 
wall. 

The young man said, “This is 
really a bad place — you shouldn’t 
be here.” 

“Then what are you doing 
here?” 

“I don’t have much money,” he 
said. “It’s cheap.” 

“You don’t have a job?” 

“I was hurt in an accident. I’m 
well now, but they wouldn’t keep 
me on — they say I would frighten 
the others. I suppose I would.” 

“Isn’t there insurance for that?” 

“I wasn’t there long enough to 
qualify.” 

“I see,” she said. She raised her 
coffee carefully, holding it with 
both hands. He wanted to tell her 
that it was about to spill — she did 
not hold it quite straight — but 
dared not. Just as it was at the 
point of running over the edge it 
found her lips. 

“You listened to the ruler,” he 
said, “while you were walking in 
the storm. I like that.” 



“Did they listen here?” she 
asked. 

“I don’t know. I wasn’t here. 
The wall was off when I came in.” 
“Everyone should,” she said. 
“He does his best for us.” 

The scarred young man nodded. 
“People won’t cooperate,” she 
said. “Don’t cooperate. Look at 
the crime problem — everyone com- 
plains about it, but it is the people 
themselves who commit the crimes. 
He tries to clean the air, the water, 
all for us — ” 

“But they burn in the open 
whenever they think they won’t be 
caught,” the young man finished 
for her, “and throw filth in the riv- 
ers. The bosses live in luxury be- 
cause of him, but they cheat on the 
standards whenever they can. He 
should destroy them.” 

“He loves them,” the girl said 
simply. “He loves everyone. When 
we say that it sounds like we’re 
saying he loves no one, but that’s 
not true. He loves everyone .” 
“Yes,” the scarred young man 
said after a moment, “but he loves 
Westwind the best. Loving every- 
one does not include loving some- 
one more than others. Tonight he 
called Westwind ‘my eyes.’ ” 
“Westwind observes for him,” 
the girl said softly, “and reports. 
Do you think Westwind is someone 
very important?” 

“He is important,” the young

man said, “because the ruler listens 
to him — and after all, it’s next to 
impossible for anyone else to get an 
audience. But I think you mean 
‘does he look important to us?’ I 
don’t think so — he’s probably some 
very obscure person you’ve never 
heard of.” 

“I think you’re right,” she said. 

He was finishing his second 
sandwich and he nodded, then real- 
ized that she could not see him. She 
was pretty, he decided, in a slender 
way, not too tall, wore no rings. 
Her nails were unpainted, which 
made her hands look, to him, like a 
schoolgirl’s. He remembered 
watching the girls playing volley- 
ball when he had been in 
school — how he had ached for 
them. He said, “You should have 
stayed in' the terminal tonight. I 
don’t think this is a safe place for 
you.” 

“Do the rooms lock?” 

“I don’t know. I haven’t seen 
them.” 

“If they don’t I’ll put a chair un- 
der the knob or something. Move 
the furniture. At the terminal I 
tried to sleep on a bench — I didn’t 
want to walk here through all that 
rain, believe me. But every time I 
fell asleep I could feel someone’s 
hand on me — once I grabbed him, 
but he pulled away. I’m not very 
strong.” 

“Wasn’t anyone else there?” 



“Some men, but they were 
trying to sleep, too — of course it 
was one of them, and perhaps they 
were all doing it together. One of 
them told the others that if they 
didn’t let me alone he’d kill some- 
one — that was when I left. I was 
afraid he wasn’t doing it — that 
somebody would be killed or at 
least that there would be a fight. 
He was the one who called about 
the cab for me. He said he’d pay.” 
“I don’t think it was him, then.” 
“I don’t either.” The girl was si- 
lent for a moment, then said, “I 
wouldn’t have minded it so much if 
I hadn’t been so tired.” 

“I understand.” 

“Would you find the lady and 
ask her to show me to my room?” 
“Maybe we could meet in the 
morning for breakfast.” 

The blind girl smiled, the first 
time the scarred young man had 
seen her smile. “That would be 
nice,” she said. 

H E WENT behind the bar and 
touched the old woman’s arm. 
“I hate to interrupt the game,” he 
said, “but the young lady would 
like to go to her room.” 

“I don’t care about the game,” 
the old woman said, “I just watch 
it because everybody else does. I’ll 
get Obie to take care of things.” 
“She’s coming,” the scarred 
young man said to the blind girl.

IF 




“I’ll go up with you. I’m ready to 
turn in myself.” 

The old woman was already mo- 
tioning for them and they followed 
her up a narrow staircase filled 
with foul odors. ‘They pee in 
here,” she said. “There’s toilets 
down at the end of the hall but they 
don’t bother to use them.” 

“How terrible,” the girl said. 
“Yes it is. But that way they’re 
getting away with some- 
thing — they’re putting one over on 
me because they know if I was to 
catch them I’d throw them out. I 
try and catch them, but at the same 
time I feel sorry for them — it’s 
pretty bad when the only wins you 
have left are the games on the wall 
and cheating a old woman by dir- 
tying her steps.” She paused at the 
top of the stairs for breath. “You 
two are going to be just side by 
side — you don’t mind that?” 

The girl said, “No,” and the 
scarred young man shook his head. 

“I didn’t think you would and 
they’re the last I’ve got anyway.” 
The scarred young man was 
looking down the narrow corridor. 
It was lined with doors, most of 
them shut. 

“I’ll put you closest to the bath- 
room,” the old woman was saying 
to the~ girl. “There’s a hook on the 
bathroom door, so don’t you 
worry. But if you stay in there too 
long somebody’ll start pounding.” 



“I’ll be all right,” the girl said. 

“Sure you will. Here’s your 
room.” 

The rooms had_ been parts of 
much larger rooms once. Now they 
were subdivided with green-painted 
partitions of some stuff like heavy 
cardboard. The old woman went 
into the girl’s place and turned on 
the light. “Bed’s here, dresser’s 
there,” she said. “Washstand in the 
corner but you have to bring your 
water from the bathroom. No 
bugs — we fumigate twice a year. 
Clean sheets.” 

The girl was feeling the edge of 
the door. Her fingers found a chain 
lock and she smiled. 

“There’s a deadbolt too,” the 
scarred young man said. 

The old woman said, “Your 
room’s next door. Come on.” 

TTIS room was much like the 
* -^girl’s, save that the cardboard 
partition (it had been liberally 
scratched with obscene words and 
pictures) was on the left instead of 
the right. He found that he was 
acutely aware of her moving be- 
hind it, the tap of her stick as she 
established the positions of the bed, 
the dresser, the washstand. He 
locked his door and took off his 
soaked coat and hung it on a hook, 
then took off his shoes and stock- 
ings. He disliked the thought of 
walking on the gritty floor in his 



WESTWIND 



115 




wet feet, but there was no alterna- 
tive except the soggy shoes. With 
his legs folded under him he sat on 
the bed, then unhooked the com- 
municator from his belt and pushed 
123-333-4477, the ruler’s number. 

“This is Westwind,’’ the scarred 
young man whispered. 

The ruler’s face appeared in the 
screen, tiny and perfect. Again, as 
he had so often before, the young 
man felt that this was his real size, 
this tiny, bright figure — he knew it 
was not true. 

“This is Westwind and I’ve got a 
place to sleep tonight. I haven’t 
found another job yet, but I met a 
girl and I think she likes me.” 

“Exciting news,” the ruler said. 
He smiled. 

The scarred young man smiled, 
too, on his unscarred side. “It’s 
raining very hard here,” he said. “I 
think this girl is very loyal to you, 
sir. The rest of the people 
here — well, I don’t know. She told 
me about a man in the terminal 
who tried to molest her and an- 
other man who wanted to protect 
her. I was going to ask you to re- 
ward him and punish the other one, 
but I’m afraid they were the same 
man — that he wanted to meet her 
and this gave him the chance.” 

“They are often the same man,” 
the ruler said. He paused as though 
lost in thought. “You are all 
right?” 



“If I don’t find something to- 
morrow I won’t be able to afford a 
place to stay, but yes, I’m all right 
tonight.” 

“You are very cheerful. West- 
wind. I love cheerfulness.” 

The good side of the scarred 
young man’s face blushed. “It’s 
easy for me,” he said. “I’ve known 
all my life that I was your spy, your 
confidant — it’s like knowing where 
a treasure is hidden. Often I feel 
sorry for the others. I hope you’re 
not too severe with them.” 

“I don’t want to aid you openly 
unless I must," the ruler said. “But 
I’ll find ways that aren’t open. 
Don’t worry.” He winked. 

“I know you will, sir.” 

“Just don’t pawn your 
communicator.” 

The image was gone, leaving 
only a blank screen. The young 
man turned out the light and con- 
tinued to undress, taking off every- 
thing but his shorts. He was lying 
down on the bed when he heard a 
thump from the other side of the 
cardboard partition. The blind girl, 
feeling her way about the room, 
must have bumped into it. He was 
about to call, ‘*Xre you hurt?” 
when he saw that one of the panels, 
a section perhaps three feet by 
four, was teetering in its frame. He 
caught it as it fell and laid it on 
floor. 

The light the old woman had 



116 



IF 




turned on still burned in the girl’s 
room and he saw that she had hung 
up her coat and wrapped her hair in 
a strip of paper towels from the 
washstand. While he watched she 
removed her black glasses, set 
them on the bureau and rubbed the 
bridge of her nose. One of her eyes 
showed only white; the iris of the 
other was the poisoned blue color 
of watered milk and turned in and 
down. Her face was lovely. While 
he watched she unbuttoned her 
blouse and hung it up. Then she un- 
hooked her communicator ,from 
her belt, ran her fingers over the 
buttons once and, without looking, 
pressed a number. 

“This is Westwind,” she said. 

He could not hear the voice that 
answered her, but the face in the 



screen, small and bright, was the 
face of the ruler. “I’m all right,” 
she said. “At first I didn’t think I 
was going to be able to find a place 
to stay tonight, but I have. And 
I’ve met someone.” 

The scarred young man lifted the 
panel back into place as gently as 
he could and lay down again upon 
his bed. When he heard the rattle of 
her cane again he tapped the parti- 
tion and called, “Breakfast tomor- 
row. Don’t forget.” 

“I won’t. Good night.” 

“Good night,” he said. 

In the room below them the old 
woman was patting her straggling 
hair into place with one hand while 
she punched a number with the 
other. “Hello,” she said, “this is 
Westwind. I saw you tonight.” •

BENTLEY PRICE, Global

hole appears in the suburban 
landscape and people start 
marching through, four and five 
abreast. They are outlandishly 
costumed in garb ranging from 
long robes to buckskin, seem of all

While a steady stream of the

ror. The President declares a na- 
tional emergency. 

29 . Once the men were seated 
around the table in the confer- 
ence room, Dr. Samuel Ives 
opened the discussion. 

“This meeting,’' he said, “de- 
spite the solemnity of the occa- 
sion that brings us together in the 
dead of night, marks what for all of 
us of the present must be an excit- 
ing event. Throughout our profes- 
sional lives most of us have at 
times puzzled over the funda- 
mental nature of time’s irre- 
versibility. A couple of us, my- 
self and Dr. Asbury Brooks, have 
spent a great deal of effort in its 
study. I am of the opinion that Dr. 
Brooks will not take it badly if I 
say we have made little, if any, 



progress. While the lay person — 
viewing time as a philosophical 
rather than a physical con- 
cept — may question the validity 
of our efforts the fact remains 
that the physical laws with which 
all of us work are embedded in this 
somewhat mysterious function 
we call time. We must ask our- 
selves, if we are completely to un- 
derstand the concepts we em- 
ploy, both in our daily lives and our 
continuing investigations in- 
to many areas of science, what 
may be the physical interrela- 
tionships underlying the expan- 
sion of the universe, informa- 
tion theory and the thermody- 
namic, electromagnetic, bio- 
logiqal and statistical arrows of 
time. In the description of any 
physical phenomenon the time 
variable is a parameter at the 
most elementary level. We have 
wondered if such a thing as uni- 
versal time exists — or are we 
dealing only with a feature of 
boundary conditions? There are 
some of us who think that the lat- 
ter may be true — that the time fac- 
tor was perhaps rather random- 
ly set at the moment of the begin- 
ning of the universe and that this 
concept has governed our think- 
ing ever since. And all of us are 
aware that our concepts of time 
must be overwhelmingly preju- 
diced by intuitive notions and

that this may be one of the factors 
that have made it so difficult for 
us to understand and formulate 
any real theories about the sub- 
ject." He looked across the table 
at the three men from the future. 
“I must beg your indulgence for 
this sort of introduction to our 
discussion — remarks that, in view 
of what you have learned, may 
sound somewhat silly. But I did 
think it important to set our own 
studies into some sort of perspec- 
tive. _Now that I have said this 
much, 1 think that it is your turn to 
talk. I assure you that all of us will 
listen most attentively. Which 
one of you would like to begin?" 

Hardwicke and Cummings 
looked at one another question- 
ingly. Finally Hardwicke said, 
"Perhaps I might as well. I must 
express the deep appreciation 
all of us feel at your willingness to 
meet with us at this unusual hour, 
i And I am afraid that we are about 
to disappoint you, for I must tell 
you that we know very little more 
about the fundamental nature 
of time than you do. We have 
asked ourselves some of the same 
questions you have asked and have 
found no real answers." 

"But you can travel in time," 
said Brooks. "That would argue 
that you must know something of 
it. You must have at least a basic 
understanding—" 



"What we found," said Ffard- 
wicke, "is that we are not the only 
universe. There are at least two 
universes coexisting within the 
same space, but universes so fun- 
damentally different from one 
another that neither ordinarily 
would be aware of the other. At 
the moment I will not go into the 
manner in which this other uni- 
verse was detected or what we 
know of it. It is not, however, a 
contraterrene universe, so there 
is, so far as we know, no danger 
from it. I might add that the first 
hint of its existence came from a 
study of the strangeness of certain 
particles. The particles them- 
selves are a part of our universe, 
but in some instances they may re- 
act to certain not entirely under- 
stood conditions in the other. We 
now have postulated two totally 
different universes — the other 
made up of particles and inter- 
actions that have little to do with 
ours. Interactions occur on so 
small a scale that only blind, 
dumb luck could bring them to 
one’s notice. 

“Fortunately our research- 
ers experienced that kind of luck. 
And it was mostly luck, too, that 
revealed to us something else 
about the second universe. I of- 
ten wonder if luck itself should be 
the subject of a study with a view 
to a better determination of its

parameters. As I said, we found 
out one other thing about the oth- 
er universe — a simple but devas- 
tating discovery. We learned 
that the arrow of time in the sec- 
ond universe flows in exactly the 
opposite direction to the one it 
travels in ours. While undoubted- 
ly in that universe it was moving 
from the universe’s past toward its 
future — in relation to our uni- 
verse it was traveling from our fu- 
ture toward our past.” 

“One thing puzzles me,” said 
Ives. “You were dealing with a 
very complex matter and yet in 
twenty years or so — ” 

“It is not as remarkable as you 
think,’’ said Cummings. “We 
launched a crash project, certain- 
ly, to achieve our means of coming 
here, but by then we were in pos- 
session of the knowledge Dr. 
Hardwicke has just outlined. On 
your old time track the second 
universe was discovered some- 
what less than a hundred years 
from now. It had been investi- 
gated for almost four centuries 
before we finally put the- time ar- 
row of the second universe to 
work. As a matter of fact, much 
significant work had been done 
on the possibility of using the 
opposite time direction of the 
second universe as a time-travel 
medium. All we had to do was 
give the investigation a final 



push. I think the method we final- 
ly devised might have been worked 
out earlier — even before the in- 
vasion by the aliens — if there had 
been any reason for doing so. 
But, aside from scientific curi- 
osity, we had little motive. Un- 
der ordinary circumstances 
there’s not much attraction to 
time travel— if you can move in 
only one direction and there's no 
possibility of returning. 

“By the time we decided," said 
Hardwicke, “that the only way 
we could survive was to travel 
back into time, much of the real 
work already had been done. 
Throughout the history of scien- 
tific inquiry a certain segment 
of the population has always 
questioned the validity of pure re- 
search. What is the good of it? 
How is it going to help us? What 
can we use it for? I think our situ- 
ation is a perfect example of the 
value of basic research. The 
work that had been done on the 
second universe and its time flow 
had been pure research, an expen- 
diture of effort and funds that 
seemed to offer no chance at all of 
either benefit or return. And yet, 
as things turned out, it did have a 
return. It offered the human race 
a chance to save itself.” 

“As I understand it, said 
Brooks, “what you have done is 
make use of the opposite time 



122 



IF 




flow of the other universe to bring 
you here. Somehow or other your 
time tunnels trap the opposite 
flow. You step into the reverse 
stream in your own present time 
and step out of it in ours. But to do 
this you must manage to speed up 
the time flow tremendously and 
be able to control it." 

Hardwicke said, “The hard part 
of the job was the implementa- 
tion theories that had already been 
worked out. Still, the end result 
turned out to be unbelievably 
simple to achieve.” 

“You think it is in the range of 
our present technology." 

“We are sure of it," said Hard- 
wicke. “That is why we chose your 
particular period. We had to se- 
lect a target that held men who 
would understand and accept our 
theories — and other men who 
could build the necessary equip- 
ment. We also needed to reach a 
time whose intellectual and 
moral climate was such that there 
would be a willingness to provide 
us the help we needed. We also 
had to find a period with an econ- 
omy productive enough to sup- 
ply us with the implements and 
tools we would need to start life 
anew in the Miocene. Perhaps we 
are being unfair to hope for so 
much from you. We have one justi- 
fication. If we had not come back 
to you the race of man would have 



ended some five hundred years 
from now. As it is, you have been 
shifted to a new time track, a phe- 
nomenon we can take time later 
to discuss, if you wish. For there 
now is a chance, although no cer- 
tainty, that you can continue in- 
to a future that holds no alien in- 
vasion." 

“Dr. Osborne, said Ives, “has 
so far taken no part in this discus- 
sion. Is there something you might 
like to add?" 

Osborne shook his head. “All 
this is beyond my competence, 
gentlemen. I'm not a physicist, 
but a geologist with leanings 
toward paleontology. I'm sim- 
ply along for the ride. Later, if 
some of you want to discuss the 
Miocene, which is our eventual 
destination— that is something 
I could talk about." 

Brooks said, “I would be inter- 
ested in hearing you right now. It's 
been proposed that some of the 
present population of the Earth 
go back into the Miocene with 
you. The idea might appeal to the 
more venturesome among us. 
Would you be willing to tell us 
what you think we might find in the 
Miocene?" 

“I would be glad to. You must 
understand, of course, that we are 
dealing in suppositions, al- 
though we can be fairly sure of 
some facts. The main reason we 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



123 




picked the Miocene is that grass 
first appeared upon the Earth 
then — grazing animals seem to 
have increased rapidly in the 
early part of the epoch. The cli- 
mate later became somewhat 
more arid, although by our calcu- 
lations there still would have been 
plenty of rainfall for agricul- 
ture. Many of the huge forest 
tracts gave way to grassy plains, 
supporting herds of herbivores. 
Evidence has been found of oreo- 
donts, sheep-sized animals that 
may have been remote relatives 
of the camels. There would have 
been camels, too, although far 
smaller than the ones you know 
today. We could expect to find 
small horses, the size of ponies. We 
might see a number of rhinos. 
Some time during the Miocene, 
probably in its early days, ele- 
phants migrated to North Ameri- 
ca over the Bering land bridge. 
They would have been four-tusk- 
ers, smaller than today's ele- 
phants. One of the more danger- 
ous animals would have been the 
giant pig, big as oxen and with 
skulls that measured four feet 
long — ugly customers to meet. 
With so many herbivores running 
in herds on the prairies, the Mio- 
cene could be expected to have its 
full quota of carnivores, both ca- 
nines and felines — probably the 
ancestors of the sabertooths. 



That's only a quick rundown. 
There is much more. The point is 
that we believe the Miocene was 
a time of rather rapid evolution- 
ary development, with the fauna 
expanding into new genera and 
species — the changes character- 
ized overall, perhaps, by a ten- 
dency of animals to increase in 
size. There might be a number of 
holdovers from the Oligocene, 
even from the Eocene. I suppose 
some of the mammals might be 
dangerous. There could be poi- 
sonous snakes and insects — I'm 
not entirely sure of that. As a 
matter of fact, we have little evi- 
dence along those lines." 

“In your estimation, how- 
ever," said Brooks, “modern man 
could survive in the Miocene." 

“We are sure he could. He could 
live off the land until he got 
started. There would be plenty of 
game, nuts, berries, fruit, roots. 
Fishing should be good. We're not 
as sure about the climate as we'd 
like to be, but there is some evi- 
dence that it would be more equa- 
ble than now. The summers prob- 
ably would be as warm, the win- 
ters not so cold. You understand 
this can’t be guaranteed." 

“I understand that, said 
Brooks, “but in any case — you're 
set on going?" 

“We have," said Osborne, 
“very little choice."

30 . Steve Wilson came back in- 
to the pressroom. The desk lamp 
was still lit, painting a circle of 
light in the darkened room. The 
teletypes muttered against the 
wall. Almost three o'clock, he 
realized. He'd have to get some 
sleep. Even with the best of luck he 
had four hours or so before he had 
to be on the job again. 

As he approached the desk 
Alice Gale rose from a chair set in 
the room's shadows. She still wore 
her white robe. He wondered if it 
was all the clothing she had. The 
people from the future had car- 
ried litle luggage. 

“Mr. Wilson," she said, “we 
have been waiting for you, hoping 
that you would come here. My fa- 
ther wants to talk with you. Will 
you see him?" 

“Certainly, said Wilson. 
“Good morning, Mr. Gale." 

Gale came out of the darkness 
and laid his attache case on the 
desk top. 

“1 am somewhat embar- 
rassed," he said. “1 find myself in 
a position that could be awk- 
ward. I wonder if you would lis- 
ten to me and tell me how to go 
about what I want to do. You seem 
to be a man who knows his way 
around." 

Wilson, moving to the desk, 
stiffened. The whole thing, he 
sensed, as Gale had said, had an 



awkwardness about it. He sensed 
he was going to be placed in a dif- 
ficult position. He waited. 

“We are well aware," said Gale, 
“that our coming from the future 
has placed a terrible burden 
upon the governments and the 
peoples of the world. We did what 
little we could. In areas where we 
knew there would be food short- 
ages we arranged the delivery of 
wheat and other foodstuffs. We 
stand ready to supply any labor 
that will be required, for we rep- 
resent a large and idle labor 
force. But the building of the tun- 
nels and the supplying tq us of the 
tools we will need in the Miocene 
will represent a vast expendi- 
ture of funds — " 

He reached down into the cir- 
cle of light on the desk top, un- 
latched the case, opened it. It was 
packed with small leather bags. 
Lifting one of these, he pulled it 
open and poured out a shower of 
cut stones that flashed and glit- 
tered in the light. 

“Diamonds," he said. 

Wilson gulped. “But why?" he 
whispered. “Why diamonds? And 
why bring them to me?" 

“These stones provided the on- 
ly way we could bring anything of 
value in small enough volume to 
be conveniently transported. 
We know that if they were dumped 
on the exchanges all at once they 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



125 




would ruin much of your econo- 
my. But if they were fed into the 
market a few at a time, surrepti- 
tiously, they would have little ef- 
fect. This is especially true if 
their existence can be kept se- 
cret. We have been very careful 
that there be no duplications — 
that no paradoxes are involved 
with their presence here. It would 
have been possible to have 
brought from the future many of 
the famous gems that now exist 
and are well known. We have not 
done this. All the stones in this case 
were found and cut in' your fu- 
ture.” 

“Put them back,” said Wilson, 
horrified. “Good God, man, can 
you imagine what might happen 
if it became known what was in 
that case? Billions of dollars — ” 

“Yes, many billions,” Gale said 
calmly, “at the going prices in 
this age. They are worth much 
more here than they were in our 
time.” 

Unhurriedly he picked up the 
stones, put them back into the 
bag, fitted the bag back into the 
case, closed and latched it. 

“I wish,” said Wilson, “you 
hadn’t told me about this.” 

“But we had to,” Alice said. 
“Don’t you see? You are the only 
one we know — the only person 
we can trust. We knew we could 
safely tell you — and that you 



could tell us what we should do.” 
Wilson struggled to put some 
calmness into his words. “Let’s 
all sit down,” he said, “and talk 
this over. And let’s not speak too 
loudly. I don’t think there is any- 
one around, but someone could 
walk in.” 

They went back beyond the cir- 
cle of light, pulled three chairs to- 
gether and sat down. 

“Now suppose you tell me,” 
Wilson said, “what you’re really 
driving at.” 

“We had thought,” said Gale, 
“that the proceeds from these 
stones, wisely marketed, could 
compensate in part for some of 
the actual costs your helping us 
entails. Not one government, not 
one people, but all the govern- 
ments and all the peoples of the 
Earth are involved.” 

“In that case — ” 

“I anticipate your question. 
Why were the stones not divided 
and offered to the separate gov- 
ernments? There are two reasons 
this was not done. We want to keep 
the number of those who know of 
these stones to a minimum. Next, 
there are few governments we can 
trust — actually some of us felt 
the United Nations should be the 
organization entrusted with the 
gems. But frankly, we have little 
confidence in the U. N. Next I 
was supposed to hand the stones to

your President. I decided against 
this when I realized how many 
problems he had weighing on his 
mind and how often he was forced 
to depend on the judgments of 
many other people.” 

"I know one thing,” said Wil- 
son. "You can't keep on carrying 
this case around with you. You 
have to be placed under security 
until it has been put into some 
safe place. Fort Knox, probably, 
if the government is willing to 
accept it.” 

"You mean, Mr. Wilson, that 
I'll have to be placed under guard? 
Fm not sure I like that. 

"Christ, 1 don't know,” said 
Wilson. "I don't even know where 
to begin. 

He reached for the phone and 
dialed. "Jane, you still on duty ? Do 
you know — has the President re- 
tired?” 

"An hour ago,” said Jane. 

"Good, said Wilson. "He 
should have gone to bed long be- 
fore then.” 

"Is it important, Steve? He left 
orders that if anything impor- 
tant came up he should be called.” 

"No, this can wait. Do you think 
you can get hold of Jerry Black?” 

"I'll try. 1 think he's still 
around.” 

The room was silent except for 
the teletypes. Gale and Alice sat 
unstirring in their chairs. Light 



still shone beneath the press- 
lounge doors, but there was no 
sound of typing. 

"We're sorry to upset you so,” 
Alice said to Wilson. "But we 
were at our wits' ends. We didn't 
know what to do.” 

"It's all right,” said Wilson. 
"You don't know how much this 
means to us,” she said. "The rest of 
the people may not know till lat- 
er, but we'll know that we did not 
come as beggars. That we paid our 
way. That's important to us.” 
Footsteps came down the corri- 
dor and turned in at the door. 

"What's going on, Steve?" 
asked Jerry Black. 

"We need a couple of men," 
said Wilson. 

"I'm one of them,” said Black. 
"I can find another.” 

"It'll be a favor,” said Wilson. 
"I have no jurisdiction. I'm act- 
ing on my own. It'll be until to- 
morrow morning — or as soon as 
I can see the President.” 

"It's okay,” said Black, "if it's 
for the President.” 

"I think,” said Wilson, "that it 
might be for him.” 

"All right. What is it?” 

"Mr. Gale has an attache ease. I 
won't tell you what is in it. You 
wouldn't want to know. But it's im- 
portant. And I want him to keep 
it — him and no one else. Until we 
know what to do with it.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



127 




“That can be managed. You 
think it needs two of us?" 

“I’d feel better if there were two 
of you." 

“No trouble," said Black. “Let 
me use your phone." 

31 . Dawn was graying the east- 
ern sky when Enoch Raven sat 
down to his typewriter. Outside 
the window lay the green Virginia 
hills, and in the trees and shrubs a 
few awakening birds began their 
twittering and chirping. 

He flexed his fingers over the 
keyboard and then began to type 
steadily and without pause. He 
had made it a rule these many 
years to have his words thought out 
before he sat down to write his col- 
umn. 

The world today faces 
what may be its greatest 
crisis, and the strangeness of 
this lies in the fact that the 
crisis comes not by the ordi- 
nary channels. Although, 
when one thinks it through, it 
becomes apparent that the 
present difficulty does par- 
allel a problem we have 
long recognized— over- 
population and the eco- 
nomic problems that could 
spring from it. As short a 
time ago as last Sunday 



morning, however, no one 
in his right mind could have 
imagined that a critical 
overpopulation could come 
upon us overnight. 

Now that it has, we are 
faced with a situation that 
must be solved, not over a 
long period of careful plan- 
ning, but in a matter of 
weeks. The brutal fact is that 
we can feed the hordes of 
people who have come to us 
for help for only a very 
limited span of time. They 
themselves are frank in ad- 
mitting that they were aware 
of the problems their com- 
ing would create and in con- 
sequence of this have 
brought us the knowledge 
and the tools we will need in 
solving them. All that re- 
mains is that we use these 
tools. This requires the will- 
ing cooperation of every 
one of us. These words are 
not used lightly, nor in a hor- 
atory political sense, but in 
a very personal way. Every 
one of us, each of us, all of us. 

What is -needed from most 
of us is forbearance, a will- 
ingness to bear certain sac- 
rifices, to tolerate certain 
inconveniences. It may 
mean that there will be less 
food — and that not so

IF 




good — for us to eat. We may 
have to wait for delivery of 
that new car. We may not be 
able to buy a new lawnmow- 
er when the 'old one breaks 
down. The economic ener- 
gy and direction that under 
normal circumstances would 
be channeled into the produc- 
tion and distribution of items 
and services we need must be 
channeled not only into send- 
ing our descendants farther 
back into time, but into pro- 
viding them with the equip- 
ment, tools and supplies they 
will need to build a viable 
culture. Detroit may be 
called on to turn out plows 
and other implements rath- 
er than cars. It may be that, 
voluntarily or by govern- 
ment decree, we may have to 
ration ourselves. Wise as 
the actions taken by Presi- 
dent Henderson may have 
been in calling for a bank 
holiday and a price and wage 
freeze, a case can be made 
for his having taken one 
further step by issuing a 
strong warning against 
hoarding. While we can ill 
afford to deal in a bureau- 
cratic manner with the press 
of events that has been 
forced upon us, it would 
seem that some move toward 



a strict rationing of food and 
other items vital to the con- 
tinuing economy should be 
taken at once. It is quite 
understandable, for politi- 
cal reasons, why Mr. Hen- 
derson might have been re- 
luctant to do this. But it is 
upon such unpopular ac- 
tions — or the failure to take 
these actions — that we 
sometimes stand or fall. 

It would scarcely seem 
necessary to point out that 
such actions as the Presi- 
dent has taken should be 
taken by other nations as 
well. It is reliably under- 
stood that Britain, Russia, 
France, Germany, Japan, 
China and possibly other 
nations may already have 
made corresponding moves 
before these words see print. 
The problem we face is 
worldwide and for it to be 
solved temporary econom- 
ic strictures must be im- 
posed not only upon the 
larger economic units, but 
upon the entire world. 

The appearance of the 
people from the future un- 
doubtedly will call forth 
from the various intellec- 
tual factions a wide variety 
of opinions, many of which 
undoubtedly will be ill- 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



129 




founded. This is illustrated 
by the public agony being 
exhibited by the Reverend 
Jake Billings, one of the 
more colorful of our evan- 
gelists, over the revelation 
that the people of five hun- 
dred years from now have 
forsaken religion as a 
rather footless factor in the 
lives of men. Distressing as 
this may be to the profes- 
sional religionists, it is 
scarcely a consideration 
that has any bearing on the 
matter immediately at 
hand. Not only on this point, 
but on many others, pro- 
found questions will be 
raised, but now is not the 
time to expend any notice- 
able amount of energy in 
trying to answer or resolve 
them. They will only further 
divide a population which, 
under the best of circum- 
stances, is bound to be di- 
vided by the basic task which 
has been brought upon us. 

We have not yet had time, 
nor indeed enough facts, to 
form a true evaluation of 
the situation. While we have 
been made aware of some of 
the basics, much is yet un- 
known. 

There is no time, of course, 
for deliberate consider- 



ation of the crisis — in es- 
sence, the world must act 
with more expediency than 
may be entirely wise. The 
very fact that expediency is 
necessary calls for a public 
forbearance that is usually 
not desirable when great is- 
sues are at stake. A storm of 
criticism and a violent put- 
ting forward of opinions at 
variance with official opin- 
ion and action will accom- 
plish nothing other than an 
impedance to a solution 
which must come quickly if 
it is to come at all. The men 
in Washington, at Whitehall 
and in the Kremlin may be 
wrong on many points, but 
their various publics must 
realize that they will be act- 
ing in honest good faith, do- 
ing what they consider 
proper. 

Democracy demands, 
and rightly, that all men 
should have a voice in their 
government and in govern- 
mental decisions and ac- 
tions, that all viewpoints be 
given fuM consideration, 
that there be no arbitrary 
decisions counter to the 
public will. But today we 
cannot afford the luxury of 
such an idealistic concept. 
The situation may not be 



130 



IF 




handled as many of us would 
wish. Some toes undoubted- 
ly will be trod upon. Certain 
ideas of justice and propri- 
ety may be outraged. But to 
accept all of this, if not in si- 
lence, at least without rais- 
ing too great an outcry, is a 
part of the forbearance that 
is called for. 

This commentator has 
no way of knowing what will 
happen. I cannot even 
guess. I am aware that there 
may be much that I will not 
like, much that I will consid- 
er could be done differently 
or better. In the past there 
has been no hesitancy on 
my part to place my person- 
al opinion on record and at 
a later date, after this is 
over, I suppose I may not be 
above pointing out glaring 
errors as I may have per- 
ceived them. But from this 
day forward and until then I 
shall, as a personal con- 
tribution, exercise stern 
censorship upon, if not my 
thoughts, at least upon my 
typewriter. I am hereby en- 
rolling myself as charter 
member in the Keep Your 
Mouth Shiit, Enoch, Club. 
The membership is wide 
open and I invite all of you 
to join. 



32 . He had somehow climbed a 
tree and gotten out on a limb— for 
no reason that seemed quite logi- 
cal — when a violent wind had 
come up. Now he was hanging 
grimly to a branch whipping in 
the wind. He knew that at any mo- 
ment his grasp might be tom loose 
and he would be thrown to the 
ground. But when he looked down 
he saw, with horror, that there 
wasn’t any ground. 

From somewhere far off, a voice 
was speaking to him, but he was so 
intent on maintaining his grip on 
the branch that he was unable to 
distinguish the words. The shak- 
ing became even more violent. 

“Steve,” the voice was saying. 
“Steve, wake up.” His eyes came 
open to a slit and he realized that 
he was in no tree. A distorted face 
swam crazily just above him. No 
one had such a face. 

“Wake up, Steve,” said a voice 
that was Henry Hunt’s. “The 
President is asking for you.’’ 
Wilson lifted a fist and scrubbed 
his eyes. The face, no longer dis- 
torted, was Henry Hunt’s. 

The face receded into the dis- 
tance as the Times man straight- 
ened. Wilson swung his feet off the 
couch, sat up. Sunlight was 
streaming through the windows 
of the press lounge. 

“What time is it?” he asked. 

“Almost eight.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



131 




Wilson squinted up at Hunt. 
“You get any sleep?” 

“I went home for a couple of 
hours. I couldn’t sleep. Things kept 
spinning in my head. So I came 
back.” He picked a jacket off the 
floor. “This yours?” 

Wilson nodded groggily. “I got 
to get washed up,” he said. “I got 
to comb my hair.” He rose to his 
feet, took the jacket from Hunt 
and tucked it under his arm. 
“What’s going on?” 

“What you might expect. The 
wires are clogged with screams of 
anguish over the business holi- 
day. How come you didn’t tip us 
off, Steve?” 

“I didn’t know. He never said a 
word about it.” 

“Well, that’s all right,” said 
Hunt. “We should have guessed it. 
Can you imagine what would have 
happened if the exchanges were 
open?” 

“Any word about the monster?” 

“Rumor. Nothing solid. One 
rumor says another got through 
in Africa. Somewhere in the 
Congo. Christ, they’ll never find it 
there.” 

“The Congo’s not all jungle, 
Henry.” 

“Where it’s supposed to have 
happened, it is.” 

Wilson headed for the wash- 
room. When he returned Hunt had 
a cup of coffee for him. 



“Thanks.” Wilson sipped the 
hot brew and shuddered. “I don't 
know if I can face the day,” he 
said. “Any idea of what the Presi- 
dent has in mind?” 

Hunt shook his head. 

“Judy in yet?” 

“Not yet, Steve.” 

Wilson put the cup down on the 
coffee table. “Thanks for getting 
me up and going,” he said. “I’ll 
see you later.” 

He went into the pressroom. 
The lamp he had forgotten to 
turn off still shone feebly on the 
desk. In the corridor outside 
footsteps went smartly up and 
down. He straightened his jacket 
and went out. 

Two men were with the Presi- 
dent. One was General Daniel 
Foote; the other was one of the 
refugees, rigged out in a moun- 
taineer outfit. 

“Good morning, Mr. Presi- 
dent,” said Wilson. 

“Good morning, Steve. You get 
any sleep?” 

“An hour or so.” 

“You know General Foote, of 
course,” said the President. “The 
gentleman with him is Isaac 
Wolfe. Dr. Wolfe is a biologist. 
He brings us rather frightening 
news. I thought you should hear 
it.” 

Wolfe was a heavy man — heavy 
of body, deep in the chest, stand- 



132 



IF 




ing on short, solid legs. His head, 
covered by a rat’s nest of graying 
hair seemed overlarge for a man 
his height. 

He stepped quickly forward 
and shook Wilson’s hand. “1 am 
sorry,” he said, “to be the bearer 
of such disturbing facts.” 

“Last night,” said the Presi- 
dent, “rather, some time this 
morning, a farmer not far from 
Harper’s Ferry was wakened by 
something in his chicken coop. 
He went out and found the hen- 
house full of strange beasts, the 
size, perhaps, of half-grown hogs. 
He fired at them and they got 
away, all except one which the 
shotgun blast almost cut in two. 
The farmer was attacked. He’s in 
a hospital. He’ll live, I’m told, 
but he was fairly well chewed up. 
From what he says there can be lit- 
tle doubt the things in the hen- 
house were a new batch of the mon- 
sters.” 

“But that’s impossible, said 
Wilson. “The monster escaped 
only a few — ” 

“Dr. Wolfe came to me last eve- 
ning,” said Foote, “shortly after 
the monster escaped from the 
tunnel. I frankly didn’t believe 
what he told me, but when the re- 
port of the henhouse episode came 
in from an officer of a search par- 
ty out in West Virginia, 1 looked 
him up and asked him to come to 



the White House. I’m sorry, Doc- 
tor, for not believing you to start 
with.” 

“But it’s still impossible,” said 
Wilson. 

“No,” said Wolfe. “It is not im- 
possible. We are dealing with an 
organism entirely different 
from anything you’ve ever known. 
The evolutionary processes of 
these monsters are like nothing 
you have even guessed. Their reac- 
tion to environmental stress is 
beyond all belief. We had known 
something of it and had deduced 
the rest. But I am convinced that 
under stresses such as the escaped 
monster is experiencing, the 
developmental procedures can 
be speeded up to a fantastic rate. 
An hour or so to hatch — an hour 
later to be hunting food. The 
same pressure that is placed upon 
the parent is transmitted to the 
young. For both the parent and 
the young this is a crisis situation. 
The parent is aware of this, of 
course — the young, of course, 
would not be. But in some strange 
manner I can’t pretend to under- 
stand a sense of desperate ur- 
gency is transmitted to the egg. 
The message seems to read: Hatch 
swiftly, grow up quickly, scatter 
widely, reach the egg-laying stage 
as soon as possible. It is a genetic 
reaction to a survival threat. The 
young aliens are driven by an ^vo- 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



133 




lutionary force that in an earthly 
life form would be inconceivable. 
They are members of a strange 
race that has a unique and inborn 
capability to use every trick in 
the evolutionary pattern to its 
advantage.” 

Wilson found a chair and sat 
down limply. He looked at the 
President. “Has any of this 
leaked out?” 

“No,” said the President, “it 
has not. The farmer’s wife phoned 
the sheriff. The military search 
party had just reached the area 
and was talking with the sheriff 
when the call came in. The officer 
in charge clamped on a security 
lid. That is why you’re here, Steve. 
We can’t keep this buttoned up. 
It’ll leak out — if not this particu- 
lar incident, then others. There 
may be hundreds of these tiny 
monsters out there in the moun- 
tains. They’ll be seen and re- 
ported. The reports will begin to 
pile up. We can’t sit on all of them, 
nor should we.” 

“The problem,” said Wilson, 
“is how to release the news with- 
out scaring the pants off every- 
body.” 

“If we don’t tell them,” said the 
President, “we create a credi- 
bility gap that will make every- 
thing we do suspect. And there is, 
as well, the matter of public safe- 
ty.” 



“In a few days,” said Foote, “all 
the mountains will be swarming 
with full-grown monsters. They 
will probably scatter. We can 
hunt some of them down, but not 
all. In any event we’ll need every 
man we can lay our hands on to 
hunt them down.” 

“That they will scatter is right,” 
said Wolfe. They will want to in- 
sure their chances of survival. And 
they can travel fast. By mother 
day, perhaps, they'll be up in New 
England, down into Georgia. 
They will keep, at first, to the 
mountainous terrain because it 
would give them the best conceal- 
ment. In time they'll begin 
branching out from the moun- 
tains.” 

“How long would you guess,” 
asked Wilson, “before they be- 
gin laying eggs?” 

Wolfe spread his hands. “Who 
can know?” he said. 

“Your best guess.” 

“A week. Two weeks.. I do not 
know.” 

“How many eggs in a clutch?” 

“A couple of dozen. You must 
understand we do not know. We 
found only a few -nests.” 

“When will they begin their kill- 
ing?” 

“Now. Right now. They must* 
eat to grow. They must do a lot of 
killing. Wild animals, farm ani- 
mals and occasionally humans. 



134 



IF 




Not many humans to start with. 
By killing men they draw atten- 
tion to themselves. Warlike as 
they may be, they still will know 
they are vulnerable because there 
are so few of them. They may be 
psychopathic killers, but they 
aren't stupid." 

“We have some troops out 
now," said the President. "We'll 
have to use many more. Get planes 
and helicopters up to spot the 
aliens. 1 talked to Sandburg just a 
while ago. He is coming in. He'll 
know what we can do. This means 
we call out the reserves, perhaps 
call back some troops from 
abroad. Not only do we have to 
hunt the monsters, but we have to 
maintain the camps for the refu- 
gees." 

"We do not wish to stand idly 
by," Wolfe put in. "There are 
many thousands of us. Give us 
arms and we'll go in side by side 
with your military. We know 
about these creatures and we were 
the ones who brought them here. 
We have a duty and — " 

"Later," said the President, 
"there will be plenty you can do. 
Getting you into the field now 
would be a tremendous task. 
Right at the moment we must de- 
pend on our own men." 

"How about the people out 
there in the mountains?" asked 
Wilson. "Do we pull them out?" 



The President shook his head. 
"I don't think so, Steve. We have, 
right now, all the refugees we can 
handle. And I'm inclined to think 
that at the moment our monsters 
may not be too aggressive. 
They're probably concentrat- 
ing on staying out of sight. There 
may be some incidents, but we 
must be prepared to accept those. 
It's all we can do. 

"I think you're right, sir," said 
Wolfe. "They are outnumbered 
now and must build up their 
strength. In any event, the young 
aliens will not, for a time, be too 
great a menace. They'll have to 
put on size and weight. They may 
know that they face deadlier wea- 
pons — and in much greater num- 
bers — than anything we could 
ever bring against them. We had 
lived in peace so long we had lost 
most of the military techniques 
and we started from scratch in wea- 
pon building." 

"You face a busy day, Mr. Pres- 
ident," said Foote. "If there is 
nothing further you wish from 

us — " 

The President rose and came 
around the desk. He shook both his 
visitors by the hand. "Thanks for 
coming by,” he said. "This is 
something we must get busy on 
immediately." 

Wilson stood up to leave. "Do I 
call in the press immediately?” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



135 




he asked. “Or should I wait until 
after you have talked with Sand- 
burg?” 

The President hesitated, con- 
sidering. “I should think right 
away,” he said. “I’d like us to be 
the first to tell them. The military 
has the lid clamped down, but it 
won’t stay clamped for long. Some 
of the people from the Hill are 
coming in to see me. It would be 
better if they knew about this be- 
fore they arrived.” 

“There’s another matter, 
said Wilson. “You were asleep 
and I didn’t want to wake you. 
There’s a dispatch case full of dia- 
monds — ” 

“Diamonds? What have dia- 
monds got todo with this?” 

“It’s a rather awkward busi- 
ness, sir,” said Wilson. “You re- 
call that case Gale was carry- 
ing—” 

“There were diamonds in that 
case?” 

“It was packed with sacks. He 
opened one sack and poured out 
diamonds on the desk. He told me 
the rest of the sacks also con- 
tained diamonds and I’m inclined 
to believe him. The refugees had 
the idea they could turn them over 
to us to pay whatever was laid out 
to send them back to the Mio- 
cene.” 

“I would like to have seen your 
face,” Henderson said, “when he 



poured out the diamonds. What, 
may I ask, did you do about it?” 

“I called in Jerry Black and put 
Gale under guard. I insisted he 
keep the diamonds.” 

“I guess that was all you could 
do. I think maybe I should call in 
the treasury people to take tem- 
porary custody and check with 
Reilly Douglas about the legality 
of all this. Did you get any idea 
how much the diamonds might be 
worth?” 

“Gale said, at present prices, 
perhaps billions of dollars. That 
is, if they can be fed into retail 
outlets slowly, without depres- 
sing the market. They’re not, you 
understand, for us alone, but for 
the entire world. Gale wants to 
leave them with us in trust as it 
were.” 

“You realize, of course, how 
sticky this could be if word leaked 
out?” 

“To be entirely fair,” said Wil- 
son, “we still must realize that 
they are only trying to be help- 
ful. They want to pay their way.” 
“Yes, I know,” said the Presi- 
dent. “We’ll have to see what 
Reilly says about it.” 

33 . The crowd had been gather- 
ing in Lafayette Park across the 
avenue from the White House 
since early morning. It was still the 
quiet and watchful group that had 



136 



IF 




stood the Sunday vigil, stolid in its 
watchfulness. But now there were 
a few placards and there had been 
none before. One of the placards, 
crudely lettered, read: back to 
the Miocene. Another read: 
bring on your sabertooths. 
Still another: let us leave this 
lousy world. 

A newsman pushed his way 
through the crowd, zeroing in on 
the whiskered youth who bore the 
back to the miocene placard. 

“Would you mind telling me,” 
he asked, “what is going on?” 

“Man,” said the youth, impa- 
tiently, “it is there for you to read. 
It says it loud and clear.” 

“It puzzles me,” said the news- 
man, “what you are trying to 
prove. Or don’t you have a point to 
make?” 

“No points this time,” the sign- 
carrier told him. “In the past we 
have tried to prove some points and 
have mostly gotten nowhere.’’ 
He made a thumb in the direction 
of the White House. “The man 
don’t listen too good. No one lis- 
tens too good.” 

“This time,” said a girl who 
stood beside the sign-carrier, 
“we’re not proving anything at 
all. We’re simply saying what we 
want to do and that’s go back to 
the Miocene.” 

“Or the Eocene,”-said another 
girl. “Or the Paleocene. Just any- 



where at all to get away from this 
scruffy place. We want to leave this 
crummy world and get another 
start. We want to go back and 
build the kind of world we want. 
We’ve been trying for years to 
change this society and we’ve got- 
ten exactly nowhere. And when 
we saw we couldn’t change it we 
tried to get out of it. That’s what 
the communes are all about. But 
the society won’t let us go. It 
reaches out and hauls us back. It 
will not let us go.” 

“Finally,” said the sign-carrier, 
“here’s a way to get shut of it. If 
these people from the future can 
travel to the past there’s no reason 
why we shouldn’t. There aren’t 
many people who would be sorry 
to see us go. Most of them would 
be glad,” 

“I suppose,” said the newsman, 
“that this could be called a move- 
ment. Most of the other things you 
people have done have been 
labeled movements. Would you 
mind telling me how many of 
you — ” 

“Not at all,” said the first girl. 
“Not more than fifteen or twenty 
of us now. But you write your story 
and let us get a news spot on tele- 
vision and there’ll be thousands of 
us. They’ll be coming from Chi- 
cago and New York, from Boston 
and Los Angeles. There’ll be more 
of us than this town can hold. Be-

cause, you see, this is the first real 
chance we’ve had to get away.” 
“That’s ail right,” the newsman 
said. “I can see your point. But 
how do you go about it? Storm 
across the street and pound on the 
White House door?” 

“If you mean,” said the sign-car- 
rier, “that no one will pay atten- 
tion to us, you may be right.'But 
twenty-four hours from now they’ll 
pay attention to us„ Forty-eight 
hours from now they’ll be out here 
in the street talking with us.” 

“But you realize, of course, there 
are no time tunnels yet. There may 
never be. Those will take materials 
and manpower.” 

“They got their manpower right 
here, mister. All anyone has got 
to do is ask. Hand us picks and 
shovels. Hand us wrenches. Hand 
us anything at all and tell us what 
to do. We’ll work until we drop. 
We’ll do anything to get away 
from here. We don’t want any pay 
for working — we don’t want any- 
thing at all except to be allowed 
to go.” 

“You tell them that,” said the 
second girl. “You put it just the 
way we say.” 

“We’re not out to kick up any 
trouble,” said the sign-carrier. 
“We don’t want to cause any fuss. 
We just want to let them know. 
This is the only way we can.” 

“We won’t ask anything if 



they’ll only let us leave,” said the 
first girl. “We would like some 
hoes and axes, maybe some pots 
and pans. But if they won’t give us 
anything we’ll go empty-handed.” 

“Prehistoric men. made out with 
stone,” said the sign-carrier. “If 
we have to we can do the same.” 

“Why stand there listening to 
them?” asked a burly individual 
with a cigar stuck in his mouth. 
“Hell, all they do is talk. They all 
are full, of crap. They don’t want to 
go anywhere. They just want to 
stir up trouble.” 

“You’re wrong,” said the man 
with the sign. “We mean exactly 
what we say. What makes you 
think we want to stay here with 
jerks like you?” 

The man with the cigar made a 
grab at the sign and one of the girls 
kicked him in the shin. His reach- 
ing fingers missed the sign. The 
carrier clunked him on the head 
with it. A man who had been stand- 
ing beside the man with the cigar 
hit the sign-carrier on the jaw. 

The scuffle exploded and the po- 
lice came in and broke it up. 

34 * Judy was 'at her desk. Notes 
were beginning to accumulate on 
the spindle. The lights on the con- 
sole were blinking. 

“You get any sleep?” asked Wil- 
son. 

She looked up at him. “A little. 



138 



IF 




I lay awake thinking, scared. It’s 
not good, is it, Steve?” 

“Not good,” he said. “It’s too 
big for us to handle. If it weren’t 
for the time element it wouldn’t be 
so bad. If we only had a little 
time.” 

She gestured toward the door 
leading to the lounge. “You won’t 
tell them that, will you?” 

He grinned. “No, I won’t tell 
them that.” 

“They’ve been asking when 
you’re going to see them.” 

“Fairly soon,” he said. 

“I might as well tell you,” she 
said. “No use waiting. I’m going 
home. Back to Ohio.” 

“But I need you here.” 

“You can get a girl from the 
secretarial pool. Couple of days 
and you won’t know the differ- 
ence.” 

“That’s not what I mean.” 

“I know what you mean. You 
need me to shack up with. It’s been 
like that for how long — six 
months? It’s this damn town. It 
makes everything dirty. Some- 
where else it might have worked for 
us. But it isn’t working here.” 
“Damn it, Judy,” he said, 
“what’s got into you? Because I 
didn’t come out last night—” 
“Partly that, perhaps. Not all 
that, of course. I • know why you 
had to stay. But it was so lonely 
and so many things had happened 



and I sat there thinking and got 
scared. I tried to call my mother 
and the lines were busy. A poor 
scared girl, for Christ’s sake, run- 
ning back to mama. But suddenly 
everything was different. I wasn’t a 
sleek, competent Washington hus- 
sy any longer — I was a kid in pig- 
tails in a little town deep in Ohio. 
It all started with my getting 
scared. Tell me honestly now — I 
had a right to be scared.” 

“You had a right, v he said 
soberly. “I’m scared myself. So is 
everyone.” 

“What’s going to happen to us?” 
“Damned if I know. But that 
isn't what we were talking about.” 
“Monsters running loose,” she 
said. “Too many mouths to feed. 
Everyone fighting one another 
or getting set to fight.” 

“We were talking about your go- 
ing to Ohio. I'm not going to ask 
you do you really mean it — be- 
cause I know you do. I suppose 
you're lucky to have a place to run 
to. Most of us have no place. I'd 
like to ask you to stay, but that 
would be unfair. What’s more, it 
would be selfish. But I still wish 
you would.” 

“I have a plane reservation,” she 
said. “With the phone tied up and 
all I was surprised to get one. The 
country's in a panic. In a time like 
this you get that terribly helpless 
feeling.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



139 




“You won’t like Ohio. Once you 
get there you won’t like it. If you’re 
scared in Washington, you’ll be 
scared in Ohio.” 

“I still am going, Steve. Come 
six-fifteen tonight I’ll be on that 
plane.” 

“There’s nothing I can say?” 

“There’s nothing you can say,” 
she said. 

“Then you’d better let the press 
in. I have some news for them.” 



35 . Senator Andrew Oakes 
hitched himself up slightly from 
the depths of the chair. “I’m not 
right sure, Mr. President,’’ he 
said, “that it’s wise to bring home 
all the troops. We need to keep our 
bases manned. And it seems to me 
we’re allowing ourselves to get 
flustered just a mite too soon. 
Some itty-bitty monsters raid a 
chicken coop out in West Virginia 
and we start bringing home the 
troops. It don’t scarcely seem 
right. And I’m not sure it was too 
smart, either, to tell the newsmen 
about these little monsters. We’ll 
get the country all up tight.” 

“Senator,” said Congressman 
Nelson Able, “I think you may 
have gotten your protocol some- 
what twisted. We were not invited 
here to decide whether the troops 
were to be brought back home, but 
rather to learn that they were be- 



ing brought back and to be told 
the reason for it.” 

“1 still believe, said Senator 
Oakes, “that President Hender- 
son would want to know our 
thoughts. He might not agree with 
them, but I think that he should 
hear them. 

“That's right, Andy,” said the 
President. “You know that 
through the years I have listened 
to you often and almost as often 
have been fascinated by what you 
had to say. Which is not to say I 
agreed with you. Most commonly 
I don’t.” 

“I am well aware of that,” said 
Oakes, “but it has not stopped me 
from saying what I think. And I 
think it’s plain damn foolishness 
to fly back the troops. It’s not go- 
ing to take the total strength of our 
military might to run down some 
little chicken-killing monsters.” 

“I think the point has been 
made,” said Senator Brian Dixon, 
“that the monsters will not stay lit- 
tle monsters. The only sensible way 
for us to tackle them is to run them 
down before there get to be any 
more of them and before they have 
a chance to grow,” 

“But how do we know,” per- 
sisted Oakes, “that they will really 
grow or increase in numbers? 
We’re taking the word of people 
who came scurrying back to us be- 
cause they couldn’t face them. And 



140 



IF 




they couldn't face them because 
they had let down their guard. 
They had no military and they had 
no weapons — " 

“Now, just a minute. Senator," 
protested Congressman Able. “It's 
all right for you to make your mili- 
tary speeches up on the Hill. You 
get a good press there and can im- 
press the public. .But this is just 
among ourselves. We won't be im- 
pressed." 

“Gentlemen," Henderson said, 
“as I see it, this is all beside the 
point. With all due deference to 
the Senator, the military will be 
brought back home. 1 1\ will be 
brought home because the secre- 
tary of defense and the chiefs of 
staff have told me the forces are 
needed here. We discussed mat- 
ters very thoroughly earlier in the 
day. The feeling was that we can- 
not take the chance of anything 
going wrong. We may be aiming 
at overkill, but that is better than 
negligence. It may be true that we 
have been given poor informa- 
tion by the people from the fu- 
ture, but I am not inclined to think 
so. They have faced the monsters 
for twenty years and it seems to me 
that they would know far more of 
them than we do. I have talked 
with members of the Academy of 
Sciences and they tell me that 
while the characteristics at- 
tributed to this life form may be 



unusual they do not go contrary 
to any established biological rule. 
So I don’t think you can say there 
has been any lack of responsibil- 
ity in the reaching of our de- 
cisions. Because of the press of cir- 
cumstances we have moved faster 
than we ordinarily would, but we 
simply haven’t got the time to go 
at any of this with due delibera- 
tion." 

Oakes did not reply, but settled 
back in his chair, grunting softly 
to himself. 

“There was a report of a mon- 
ster loose in the Congo,” said 
Congressman Wayne Smith. 
“Have you, sir, any further in- 
formation?" 

“None," Henderson said. “We 
can’t be sure one did get through. 
The reports are unreliable." 

“There has been no request for 
aid to hunt it down?" 

“No request,” said the 
President. “Nothing official at 
all." 

“How about the tunnels, sir? 
The news reports seem to be in 
some conflict. Some of them, we 
know, have closed, but I can’t seem 
to get a clear idea of what is going 
on." 

“You probably know as much as 
we do here, Wayne. Here at home 
the Virginia tunnel is closed, of 
course. Two more were closed 
without our intervention — one in 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



141 




Wisconsin, the other down in 
Texas. I suppose those were shut 
down by the people in the future 
when the monsters were moving 
too close. Either that or there were 
malfunctions. Otherwise all the 
tunnels in the United States still 
are operating.” 

' “Would you think that the two 
you mentioned as closing may 
have done so because all the peo- 
ple had come through? There has 
to be an end to all these people 
some time.” 

“We know the Wisconsin tunnel 
closed because of an attack at the 
other end. The last of the people 
who came through told us that. I' 
don’t know about the Texas clos- 
ing. But as to the implied ques- 
tion of all the people having come 
through — yes, I would hope that 
soon the tunnels would start clos- 
ing because they’ve done their 
job.” 

“Mr. President,” asked Senator 
Dixon, “what do you know about 
the practical side of tunnel build- 
ing? Can we build the tunnels so 
the people can go back into the 
past?” 

“I am told we can,” said the 
President. “Our physicists and 
engineers are working with 
refugee scientists and engineers 
right now. The refugees have 
picked out the sites where the tun- 
nels should be built. One en- 



couraging feature is that not as 
many tunnels need be built as were 
used in bringing these people 
here. There isn’t the immediate 
time pressure to get them all back 
into the Miocene. Also, as I un- 
derstand it, transportation can 
be used to get the people to tunnels 
several hundred miles away. The 
one problem is getting some tun- 
nels built and the people moving 
out before the refugees eat us out 
of house and home.” 

“The construction of the tun- 
nels, then, isn’t beyond our capa- 
bility? All we need is time, money 
and labor.” 

“That is right, Brian. Labor is 
no problem. The refugees repre- 
sent a huge and willing labor force 
and just an hour or so ago I had 
word from Terry Roberts that our 
labor peple will raise no objection 
to our using them on what must be 
viewed as a federal project. Terry 
assures me that unions will co- 
operate in every way. Money is a 
problem. Even should industry be 
as willing to go along with us as 
labor is a vast amount of retool- 
ing will be necessary before we 
can start fabricating the com- 
ponents for the tunnels. Ordinarily 
retooling is a time-consuming 
process and a costly one. The fact 
that we must get at it immediate- 
ly and around the clock makes it 
expensive beyond anything that 



142 



IF 




can be imagined. Next, the com- 
ponents themselves will be costly 
items. And the brunt of the work 
must be borne by the pre- 
dominantly industrial nations. 
We, Germany, Russia, France, 
Britain, China, Japan and a few 
others must build the com- 
ponents — not only for ourselves 
but for the rest of the world. And 
we must build enough tunnels for 
there to be a fairly consistent 
regional distribution when they 
go back to the Miocene. While the 
population of the future is not as 
great as ours, it still must be scat- 
tered. The building of a new 
civilization in the past would be 
defeated if we dumped too many 
people in one area. And we must 
also furnish the refugees with the 
tools, livestock and seed they will 
need to make a new beginning. 
Furnishing the tools is going to 
call for a significant industrial ca- 
pacity/’ 

“Have you talked with anyone 
in the industrial community?" 

“Not personally. Commerce is 
making some tentative ap- 
proaches to see what sort of reac- 
tion is forthcoming. I have no 
word as yet. But it seems to me 
there should be some positive 
reaction. 1 should be disap- 
pointed if there weren't." 

Oakes hunched up out of his 
chair. “Have you any idea yet, Mr. 



President, what all of this might 
cost? Any good round figure?" 

“No," Henderson said, “I 
haven't." 

“But it's going to be costly." 

“It is going to be costly." 

“Maybe a great deal more than 
the defense budget, which every- 
one seems so horrified about." 

“You want me to say it, of 
course — " Henderson smiled — 
“so I will. Yes, it is going to be 
more costly than the defense bud- 
get, many times more costly. It 
will be even more costly than a 
war. It may bankrupt the world — 
but what would you have us do? 
Go out and shoot down all the 
refugees? That would solve the 
problem. Is that a solution you 
would like?" 

Grumbling, Oakes let himself 
sink back into the chair. 

“One thing has occurred to me," 
said Able. “There is the possibility 
that no matter what it costs us we 
may get value received. The 
refugees come from a time period 
where many technological prob- 
lems have been worked out, new 
approaches have been developed. 
One thing that has been men- 
tioned is fusion power. We are no- 
where near that yet — it may take 
us years to get there. For us fusion 
power would be a great leap for- 
ward. I would assume that, in re- 
turn for what we propose to do for 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



143 




them, they’d be willing to acquaint 
us with the basics of their techno- 
logical advances.” 

“It would ruin us,” Oakes said 
wrathfully. “It would finish up the 
job they’ve started. Take fusion 
power — there, gentlemen, in the 
twinkling of an eye, the gas and oil 
and coal industries go down the 
drain.” 

“And,” said Able, “I suppose 
the medical profession as well — if 
these people could give us the cure 
for cancer.” 

Dixon said, “What the Con- 
gressman says is true. If we had 
the advantages of all their scien- 
tific and technological ad- 
vances — perhaps their social and 
political advances — we would be 
much better off than we are to- 
day. To whom, I wonder, would 
the new knowledge and principles 
belong? To the man who was able 
to acquire the information by 
whatever means? Or to his govern- 
ment? Or to the world at large? 
And if the last — how would the in- 
formation be handled or imple- 
mented? It seems to me that at best 
we would have many thorny prob- 
lems to work out.” 

Congressman Smith put in, 
“This is all speculation. Right now, 
it seems to me, we have two im- 
mediate problems. We have to dis- 
pose of the aliens and do whatever 
is possible to send our guests back 



to the Miocene. Is this the way 
you read it, Mr. President?” 
“Exactly,” Henderson said. 

“I understand, Oakes rum- 
bled, “that the Russian ambas- 
sador is coming over to have a 
pow-wow with you.” 

“You were not supposed to 
know that, Andy.” 

“Well, you know how it is, Mr. 
President. You stay up on the Hill 
long enough and you get a lot of 
pipelines. You get told things. 
Even what you’re not supposed to 
know.” 

“The ambassador’s visit is no 
secret,” Henderson said. “I have 
no idea why he’s coming, but we 
are trying to work closely with 
everyone. I have had phone con- 
versations with a number of 
heads of state. I take it that the am- 
bassador’s visit is no more than an 
extension of these talks.” 

“Perhaps,” said Oakes. “Per- 
haps. I just tend to get a mite 
nervous when the Russians be- 
come too interested in anything 
at all.” 

36 . There was something in the 
hazel thicket at the edge of the tiny 
cornfield— a vague sense of a 
presence, a tantalizing outline 
that never quite revealed itself. 
Something lurked there, waiting. 
Sergeant Gordy Clark was quite 
sure of that. Just how he knew he 



144 



IF 




could not be sure. But he was 
sure — or almost sure. Some in- 
stinct born out of hundreds of pa- 
trols into enemy country, some- 
thing gained through the sharp, 
hard objectivity that was neces- 
sary for an old soldier to keep him- 
self alive while others died — some- 
thing that he or no one else could 
define told him there was a lurker 
in the thicket. 

He lay silent, almost unbreath- 
ing, stretched out on the little 
ridge that rose above the cornfield, 
his rocket launcher steadied on an 
ancient, rotted log and the cross- 
hairs centered on the thicket. It 
could be a dog, he told himself, or 
a child, perhaps even nothing — but 
he could not bring himself to think 
it was nothing. 

The drooping sumac bush bent 
close above him, shielding him 
from the view of whatever might 
be in the thicket. He could hear the 
faint mutter of the mountain 
brook that ran just beyond the 
cornfield. And from the hollow 
between the hills, where the farm 
buildings were located, came the 
senseless cackling of a hen. 

There was no sign of any other 
member of the patrol. He knew 
several of them must be close, but 
they were being careful not to be- 
tray their presence. They were 
regulars, every one of them, and 
they knew their business. They 



could move through these woods 
like shadows. They would make no 
noise, disturb no bush or branch. 

The sergeant smiled grimly to 
himself. They were good men. He 
had trained them all. The captain 
thought himself the one who had 
trained them, but it had not been 
the captain. Sergeant Gordon 
Fairfield Clark had beaten their 
business into these men. They all 
hated him, of course, and he 
wanted it no other way. For out of 
hatred could sometimes come 
respect. Fear or respect, he 
thought — either one would serve. 
There were some, perhaps, who 
had cherished the fantasy of put- 
ting a bullet through his skull. 
They must have had oppor- 
tunities, but they had never done it. 
For they needed him, the sergeant 
told himself — although not real- 
ly him, of course, but the hatred 
they had for him. There was 
nothing like a good strong hatred 
to hold a man together. 

The farmer at the buildings in 
the hollow thought he had seen 
something. He couldn’t tell what it 
was, but it had been pretty awful 
from the glimpse he had gotten of 
it. A kind of thing he had never 
seen before. Something no man 
could imagine. The farmer had 
shivered as he talked. 

The thing in the thicket came out 
so fast that it seemed to blur. Then, 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



145 




as quickly as it had moved, it 
stopped. It stood in the little open 
space of ground between the 
thicket and the com. 

Sergeant Clark caught his breath 
and his guts turned over, but even 
so he moved the launcher to cen- 
ter the cross-hairs on the crea- 
ture’s great paunch and his finger 
began the steady squeeze. 

Then it was gone. The .cross- 
hairs centered on nothing except 
the ragged clump of brush beyond 
the cornfield’s edge. Clark didn’t 
stir. He lay looking through the 
sight, but his finger slacked off the 
trigger. 

The monster had not moved. He 
was sure of that. It had simply dis- 
appeared. One microsecond 
there — the next, gone. Nothing 
could move that fast. 

Sergeant Clark raised his head, 
levered himself to his knees. He 
wiped his face and was astonished 
to find that his hand came away 
greasy wet. He had not been aware 
that he was sweating. 

37. Fyodor Morozov was a good 
diplomat and a decent man, the 
two not being incompatible, and 
he hated what he had to do. Be- 
sides, he told himself, he knew 
Americans and his present errand 
simply would not work. It would, 
of course, embarrass them and 
point out their sins for all the world 



to see and, under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, he would not have 
been averse to this. But under 
present conditions, he knew, the 
Americans were in no position to 
observe the niceties of diplomatic 
games and there was no way to 
gauge reactions. 

The President was waiting for 
him when he was ushered in and 
beside Henderson as was to be ex- 
pected, stood Secretary of State 
Williams. The President was all 
open blandness, but Thornton 
Williams, Fyodor could see, was a 
somewhat puzzled man, al- 
though he was doing an excellent 
job of hiding what he felt. 

When they had "shaken hands 
and sat down the President opened 
the conversation. “It’s always 
good to see you, Mr. Am- 
bassador,” he said, “for any rea- 
son — or even for no reason. But 
tell me, is there something we can 
do for you?” 

“My government,” said Fyodor, 
“has asked me to confer with your 
government — as unofficially as 
our official positions can make 
possible — concerning a matter of 
security I would assume is of some 
concern to both of us — in fact, to 
everyone.” 

He paused and they waited for 
him to go on. They did not re- 
spond — they asked no questions. 
They were no help at all. 



146 



IF 




“It is the matter,” he said, “of 
the alien creature that escaped 
from the Congo tunnel. There is 
no question that it must be hunted 
down. Since the Congo does not 
have sufficient military or police 
forces to accomplish this, my 
government is offering to supply 
some troops and we are about to 
sound out both Britain and France 
and perhaps other nations as 
well to determine if they might 
want to contribute to a joint ex- 
peditionary force against the 
monster.” 

“Certainly, Ambassador Mor- 
ozov,” said Williams, “your gov- 
ernment does not feel compelled* 
to seek our permission to embark 
on so neighborly an undertaking. 

I would imagine that you are pre- 
pared to make guarantees that 
you’ll withdraw all forces after the 
alien has been taken.” 

“Of course we are.” 

“Then I fail to grasp your 
point.” 

“There is also, said Fyodor, 
“the matter of the aliens — or 
monsters — on your own territory. 
We are. prepared to make the 
same offer to you as we will make 
the Congo.” 

“You mean,” said the Presi- 
dent, amused, “that you would be 
willing to lend us some of your 
forces to hunt down the aliens?” 
“We would go, I think,” said 



the ambassador, “somewhat be- 
yond the word you use — willing. I 
would think that, unless you can 
guarantee absolute effectiveness 
in containing and disposing of 
the creatures, we might possibly 
insist. This is not a national mat- 
ter — the international com- 
munity is concerned. The in- 
vaders must be obliterated. If you 
can’t accomplish this, then you 
must accept any help that’s of- 
fered.” 

“You know, of course,” said 
Williams, “that we are bringing 
home our troops.” 

“I know that, Mr. Secretary, 
but the question is how quickly 
can you bring them home. Our 
military people estimate it will 
take you thirty days at least and 
that may not be fast enough. There 
also is the question of whether 
you have personnel enough to cov- 
er the required territory.” 

The President said, “I can as- 
sure you that we appreciate your 
concern.” 

“It is the position of my govern- 
ment,” said Fyodor, “that many 
more men would be placed on the 
ground — and more quickly — if 
you accepted the aid we offer — ” 

“Mr. Ambassador,” said the 
President, interrupting, “I am 
certain you know better than to 
come to us with such an impudent 
suggestion. Surely you are aware 



OUR CHILDREN'S CH ILDREN 



147 




that if there had been genuine good 
will on the part of your govern- 
ment a different approach would 
have been employed. There is no 
question in my mind that the sole 
purpose of this call is to em- 
barrass us. In that, of course, 
you’ve failed. We are not in the 
least embarrassed.” 

“I am delighted that you’re 
not,” said Fyodor, unruffled. 
“We thought it was only the decent 
thing to approach you first in 
private.” 

“I assume,” said Williams, “you 
mean you now will bring the mat- 
ter up before the U.N., where 
you’ll seek to embarrass us in 
public.” 

“You gentlemen,” said the am- 
bassador, “persist in placing a 
wrong interpretation on this mat- 
ter. It is true, of course, that our 
countries have had their differ- 
ences in the past. We have not al- 
ways seen exactly eye to eye. Un- 
der present circumstances, how- 
ever, the entire world needs to 
stand together. It is quite clear to 
us — if not to you — that solving the 
alien problem quickly is in the in- 
ternational interest and that it is 
your duty to accept such aid as 
may be needed. We should be re- 
luctant to report to the United 
Nations that you neglect your 
duty.” 

“We would not attempt,” said 



Williams stiffly, “to suggest what 
you might tell the U.N.” 

'“If you should decide to accept 
our offer,” said the ambassador, 
“it would be agreeable to us to 
leave the initiative with you. If you 
should ask other nations — per- 
haps Canada, Britain, France and 
us — to supply the additional 
forces that you need nothing has to 
be said about this conversation.” 

“I suppose,” Henderson said, 
“you will want to relay an answer 
to your government.” 

“We would imagine you might 
want to deliberate on its nature. 
The U.N. does not meet until to- 
morrow noon.” 

“And if we asked some of our 
friends among the community of 
nations to supply us troops and 
did not include your government 
among them you would be of- 
fended?” 

“I cannot answer that with any 
surety — but I would presume we 
might be.” 

“It seems to me,” Williams said, 
“that all of this is no more than of- 
ficial mischief-making. I have 
known you for some years and 
have held a high regard for you. 
You have been here among us for 
three years — or is it four? — and 
surely you have grown to know us 
in that length of time. I think that 
your heart may not be entirely in 
these proceedings.”

Fyodor Morozov rose slowly to 
his feet. “I have delivered the mes- 
sage from my government,” he 
said. “Thank you both for seeing 
me.” 



38 . In New York, Chicago and 
Atlanta, mobs hurled themselves 
against police lines. The signs read: 
we didn’t ask them to come. 
They read: we have little 
enough as it is. They read: we 
refuse to starve. The crowds 
threw stones, bricks, tin cans bat- 
tered into tin shinny pucks with 
cutting edges, plastic bags filled 
with garbage. The ghetto areas 
roiled with violence. Some 
died — many were injured. Bon- 
fires were kindled. Houses burned 
and when fire rigs tried to reach the 
blazes they were stopped by bar- 
ricades. Great areas were given 
over to looting. 

In little towns throughout the 
country grim-faced men talked on 
benches in front of general stores, 
at filling stations, feed stores, 
street corners, at coffee breaks in 
the corner drug store and while 
waiting their turns in barber 
shops. They said to one another: It 
don’t seem right, somehow. It 
don’t seem possible. It ain’t like 
the old days, when you knew what 
was going on. There ain’t no tell- 
ing these days what will happen 



next. Too much is new-fangled 
now. The old days are going fast. 
There is nothing left for a man to 
hang to. 

They said judiciously: Of course 
if it is the way they say, we got to 
do our best for them. You heard 
the President say it last night. Chil- 
dren of our children. That’s what 
he said. Although I don’t know 
how we’re going to do it. Not with 
taxes what they are. We can’t pay 
no more taxes, and them tunnels 
are about to cost a mint. Taxes on 
everything you buy. On every- 
thing you do. On everything you 
own. Seems no matter how hard a 
man may scratch he can’t keep 
ahead of taxes. 

They said sanctimoniously: That 
preacher down in Nashville hit it 
on the head. If a man loses his re- 
ligion he has lost everything 
worthwhile. He has nothing left to 
live for. You lose the Good Book 
and you have lost it all. It don?t 
seem possible that even in five 
hundred years men would have 
given up their God. It’s the evil in 
the world today, right now, that’s 
made it possible. It’s big-city liv- 
ing. The meanness of it. Out here 
you could never lose your God. No, 
sir, He’s with you all the time. You 
feel Him in the wind. You see Him 
in the color of the eastern sky just 
before the break of dawn. You 
sense Him in the hush of evening. I 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



149 




feel sorry for these people from 
the future. I do feel purely sorry 
for them. They don’t know what 
they lost. 

They said angrily of the riots: 
Ought to shoot them down. I 
wouldn’t fool around with stuff like 
that. Not for a minute would I. 
Those people, some of them, ain’t' 
never done a lick of work in their 
entire lives. They just stand there 
with their hands out. You can’t tell 
me, if a man really wants to 
work — or a woman either — he or 
she can’t find a job. Out here we 
scratch and dig and sweat and we 
get next to nothing, but we don’t 
riot, we don’t burn, we don’t stand 
with hands out. 

They said of the young people 
with the signs in Lafayette Park: If 
they want to go to the Miocene or 
whatever this place is, why don’t 
we let them go? We won’t never 
miss them. We would be better off 
without them. 

The village banker said with 
ponderous judiciousness: Mark 
my word, we’ll be lucky if these fu- 
ture folks don’t ruin the entire 
country. Yes, sir, the entire coun- 
try — maybe the entire world. The 
dollar will be worth nothing and 
prices will go up. 

And inevitably some got around 
to whispering their blackest 
thoughts: You just wait and see. 
It’s a Commie plot, I tell you. A 



dirty Commie plot. I don’t know 
how they worked it, but when the 
wash comes out we’ll find these 
Russians at the bottom of it. 

There was marching in the land, 
a surge toward Washington by 
hitch-hiking, by bus, by old beat- 
up clunkers. An inward stream- 
ing of the counter-cultural young. 
Some of them reached the city be- 
fore the fall of night and marched 
with banners saying back to the 

MIOCENE — BRING ON THE SABER- 
TOOTHS! Others continued 
through the night or rested briefly 
in haystacks or on park benches, 
wolfing hamburgers, seeking out 
alliances, talking in hushed tones 
around campfires. 

In the streets of Washington 
bands formed around young men 
staggering under the weight of 
heavy crosses, stumbling and fall- 
ing, staggering up again to con- 
tinue on their way. Some wore 
crowns of thorns, blood trickling 
down their foreheads. Late in the 
afternoon a furious fight broke out 
in Lafayette Park when an in- 
dignant crowd, among them many 
of the hopefully Miocene-bound 
youngsters, moved to stop a 
crucifixion, with the victim al- 
ready lashed to the cross and the 
hole half dug for its planting. 
Police charged in and after a 
bloody fifteen minutes cleared the 
park. When this was over four

IF 




crudely fashioned crosses were 
gathered up and carted off. 

“These kids are crazy," said one 
panting officer. “I wouldn't give 
you a dime for the whole lot of 
them." 

Senator Andrew Oakes phoned 
Grant Wellington. “Now is the 
time," he said in a conspiratorial 
voice, “to lie low. Don't say a 
word. Don't even look as if you 
were interested. The situation, 
you might say, is fluid. Nothing is 
set. No one knows which way the 
cat will jump. But something is go- 
ing on. The Russian was at the 
White House this morning and that 
bodes no good for anyone. Some- 
thing we don't understand is very 
much afoot." 

Clinton Chapman phoned Reilly 
Douglas. “You know anything, 
Reilly?" 

“Nothing except that there real- 
ly is time travel and we have the 
blueprints for it." 

“You have seen the blueprints?" 

“No, 1 haven't. It's all under 
wraps. No one is saying anything. 
The scientists who talked with the 
future people aren't talking." 

“But you—" 

“I know, Clint. I'm the attorney 
general, but, hell, in a thing like 
this that doesn't count for any- 
thing. This is top secret. A few of 
the Academy crowd are in on it and 
that is all. Not even the mili- 



tary — and even if the military 
wanted it I have my doubts — " 

“But they have to let someone 
know. You can't build a thing un- 
til you know how. 

“The blueprints show how to 
build it, but that's all. Not what it 
really is. Not how it works. Not 
why it works. Not the principle." 

“What the hell difference does 
that make?" 

“I should think it would make 
some," said Douglas. “I, personal- 
ly, would be distrustful of build- 
ing something I didn't under- 
stand." 

“You say it is time travel. No 
doubt of that? It really is time 
travel 4 ? 1 " 

“No doubt at all," said Douglas. 

“Then there's a mint in it," said 
Chapman, “and I mean to — " 

“But if it only works one way." 

“It has to work both ways," said 
Chapman. “That's what my peo- 
ple tell me." 

“It will take a lot of financing," 
said Douglas. 

“I've talked to a lot of people," 
said Chapman. “People I can 
trust. They are interested. They 
see the possibilities. There'll be no 
lack of funds if we can put it 
through." 

Judy Gray got on the plane and 
found her seat. She looked out 
through the window, saw the 
scurrying trucks mistily and

quickly put up a hand to wipe her 
eyes. 

She said to herself, almost lov- 
ingly, through clenched teeth, “The 
son of a bitch. The dirty son of a 
bitch!” 

39 . Tom Manning spoke 
guardedly into the phone. “Steve, I 
have been hearing things.” 

“Put them on the wire, Tom,” 
said Wilson. “That’s why you are 
there. Put them on the wire for the 
glory days of dear old Global 
News.” 

“Now,” said Manning, “that 
you’ve had occasion to show off 
your shallow sense of humor, 
shall we get down to business?” 

“If this is a ploy,” said Wilson, 
“to trick me into confirmation of 
some rumor you have heard — 
you know it won’t work.” 

“You know me better than that, 
Steve.” 

“That’s the trouble. I do know 
you.” 

“All right, then,” said Man- 
ning, “if that’s the way of it let’s 
start at the beginning. The Presi- 
dent had the Russian ambassa- 
dor in this morning — ” 

“The President didn’t have him 
in. He came in on his own. The am- 
bassador made a statement to 
the press. You know about that.” 
“Sure, we know what the am- 
bassador said and what you said 



in this afternoon’s briefing, 
which, I might say, added very lit- 
tle light to the situation. But no 
one in town, no one in his right 
mind, that is, buys what either of 
you said.” 

“I’m sorry about that, Tom. I 
told all I knew.” 

“Okay,” said Manning. “I’ll 
take your word for that. It’s just 
possible that you weren’t told. But 
there’s a very nasty story being 
whispered at the U.N. in New 
York. At least it was whispered to 
our man there. I don’t know how 
much farther it has gone. Our man 
didn’t put it on the wire. He phoned 
me and I told him to hold it until I 
talked with you.” 

“I don’t have the least idea, 
Tom, ofwhat you’re talking about. 
I had honestly assumed the am- 
bassador told all that could be 
told. There have been some con- 
versations with Moscow and it 
sounded reasonable. The Presi- 
dent didn’t tell me differently. We 
mentioned it, I guess, but we 
didn’t talk about it. There were so 
many other things.” 

“All right, then,” said Man- 
ning, “here’s the stoYy as I heard it. 
Morozov talked to Williams and 
the President and offered troops 
to help hunt down the monsters 
and the offer was rejected.” 

“Tom, how good is your source? 
How sure are you of this?”

Hale. He’s your man up there.’’ 

“One of the best,” said Man- 
ning. “He’s fairly good at sorting 
out the truth.” 

“Yes, he is. I remember him 
from Chicago days.” 

“Hale’s informant told him 
that tomorrow the U.N. will be 
told of our refusal and a demand 
will be made that we be forced to 
admit troops from other nations. 
It’ll be said that we are negligent 
in not accepting them.” 

“The old squeeze play,” said 
Wilson. 

“And that’s not all of it. If other 
troops are not accepted and the 
aliens can’t he controlled — then, 
the U.N. will be told, the entire 
area must be nuclearly destroyed. 
The world can’t take chances.” 

“Wait a minute,” said Wilson, 
quickly. “You’re not putting this 
on the wires, you say?” 

“Not yet. Probably never. I 
hope never. That’s the reason I 
phoned. If Hale heard it there’s a 
likelihood someone else will hear 
it and, sure as God, it will get on a 
wire or be published somewhere.” 
“There’s no truth in it,” said 
Wilson. “I am sure of it. Christ, 
we’re all in this together. For the 
moment political power plays 
must be set aside. Tom, I simply 
OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



can’t believe this hearsay.” 

“You know nothing of this? Of 
any of it? There hasn’t been a 
breath?” 

“Not a breath,” said Wilson. 
“You know,” said Manning, “I 
wouldn’t have your job, Steve. Not 
for a million dollars.” 

“You’ll hold off, Tom. You’ll 
give us a little time to check.” 

“Of course. Until the pressure 
gets too great. Until someone 
else . I’ll let you know.” 

“Thanks, Tom. Some day — ” 
“Some day, when this is all 
over,” said Manning, “we’ll go off 
into some dark corner in an ob- 
scure bar where no one can pos- 
sibly find us and we’ll hang one 
on.” 

“I’ll stand the drinks,” said 
Wilson. 

He sat slumped after hanging 
up. Just when another day was 
about to end, he thought. But, hell, 
some days never ended. They just 
kept on and on. Yesterday and 
today had not been two days, but a 
nightmare-haunted eternity that 
seemed, when one thought of it, to 
have no reality at all. Judy gone. 
Kids marching in the street. The 
business community bitching be- 
cause it was prevented from using 
the economic disruption to go out 
and make a killing. Pulpit- 
thumping preachers hell-bent to

monsters running in the hills and 
the future still emptying its 
humanity upon this moment in the 
time track. 

His eyelids slid down and stuck 
and he forced himself erect. He 
had to get some sleep tonight — he 
had to find the time to get some 
sleep. 

Mqybe Judy had had the right 
idea. Just get up and walk away 
from it. Although, he told himself 
quite honestly, there still re- 
mained the question of what she’d 
walked away from. He missed 
her — she had been gone no more 
than an hour or two and he was 
missing her. Quite suddenly he 
realized he’d been missing her all 
day. Even while she still had been 
here, be had been missing her. 
Maybe, he thought, he should 
have asked her once again to stay, 
but there hadn’t been time and he 
hadn’t known how to do it — at 
least how to do it gracefully. And 
you did things gracefully or you 
did them not at all. More than 
likely, had he known, she wouldn’t 
have listened to him. 

He picked up the phone. “Kim, 
you still there? I’ll need to see the 
President. It is rather urgent. The 
first chance you have to squeeze me 
in.” 

“It may be some time, Steve,” 
she said. “There is a cabinet 
meeting.” 



40 * Sergeant Gordon Fairfield 
Clark said to Colonel Eugene 
Dawson, “I had it in my sights and 
then it wasn’t there. It disap- 
peared. It went away. I’m sure it 
didn’t move. Like a cartoonist 
drawing something moving fast, 
lettering in a swish, but this was 
without a swish. When it dis- 
appeared there wasn’t any motion. 
The first time I could see move- 
ment. But not when I had it in my 
sights. It didn’t move then. It 
didn’t blur.” 

“It saw you, Sergeant,” said the 
colonel. 

“I would think not, sir. I was 
well hidden. I kept still. I shifted 
the launcher barrel a couple of 
inches to aim it. That was all.” 

“It saw one of your men, then. 
It must have.” 

“Sir, I trained all those men my- 
self. No one sees them — no one 
hears them.” 

“It saw something or heard 
something. It sensed danger and 
disappeared. You’re sure about 
this disappearance, Sergeant? Ab- 
solutely?” 

'Colonel, I am sure.” 

Dawson was sitting on a fallen 
log. He reached down and picked 
up a small twig from the duff of the 
forest floor, began breaking it 
and rebreaking it. Clark squatted 
to one side, leaning on the 
launcher.

IF 




“Seargent," Dawson said, “I 
don’t know what the hell we’re go- 
ing to do about all this. I don’t 
know what the army's going to do. 
You find one of these things and 
before you can whap it, it is gone. 
We can handle them. I am sure of 
that. Even when they get big and 
rough and mean, like the people 
from the future say they will, we 
still can handle them. We’ve got 
the firepower. We have the sophis- 
tication. If they’d line up and 
come at us we could clobber them. 
But not when they're trying to 
keep clear of us and not in this kind 
of terrain. We could bomb ten 
thousand acres flat and get maybe 
one of them. God knows what else 
we’d kill, including people. We 
haven't the time or manpower to 
evacuate the people so that we can 
bomb. We’ve got to hunt these 
damned beasts down one by 
one — " 

“But even when we hunt them 
down, sir — " 

“Yes, I know." 

“Sir," said Sergeant Clark, 
“This is worse than Vietnam ever 
was. And Vietnam was hairy." 

The colonel stood up. “Nothing 
has ever beaten us all the way. 
These aliens won't either. But we 
have to find out how to kill them. 
All the firepower in the world, all 
the sophistication in the world is 
of no use until you can find some- 



thing to aim at long enough to pull 
the trigger.’’ 

Sergeant Clark rose to his feet, 
tucked the launcher under his arm. 
“Well, back to work,’’ he said. 

“Have you seen a photographer 
around here?" 

“A photographer? What 
photographer. I ain’t seen no 
photographer." 

“His name was Price. With 
some press association. He was 
messing around. I put the run on 
him.’’ 

“If I happen onto him," Ser- 
geant Clark said, “I’ll tie his tail in 
a knot." 



41 • Reverend Jake Billings was in 
conference with Ray MacDon- 
ald, formerly his assistant pub- 
lic relations manager, who had 
been appointed within the last 
twelve hours to the post of crusade 
operations chief. 

“I really do not think, Ray," 
said Billings, “that this business of 
crucifixion will advance our 
cause. It strikes me as being ra- 
ther crude and it could backlash. 
As one paper had to say of the at- 
tempt at Washington — " 

“You mean someone has al- 
ready gotten around to editorial- 
izing about it?" 

“The reaction has not been 
good." Billings spoke with unac- 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



155 




customed heat. “The editorial 
called it a cheap trick and a panty- 
waisted effort. The editorial be- 
came facetious in tone as it des- 
cribed the use of thongs, rather 
than nails in fastening the young 
man to the cross.” 

“But they were wrong,” 
MacDonald said. 

“You mean that you used 
nails?” 

“No. What I’m saying is that 
ordinarily the arms are tied, not 
nailed to the cross. We did some re- 
search on it — ” 

“Your research is no concern 
of mine,” said Billings icily. 
“What 1 do care about is that you 
gave some smart-assed editorial 
writer a chance to poke fun at us. 
And in any case, I think the whole 
idea of a fake crucifixion stinks. 
You didn’t check with me. How 
come you didn’t check with me?” 

“You were busy, Jake. You told 
me to do my best. You told me I 
was the man who could come up 
with ideas and I did come up with 
ideas. 1 ’ 

“I also had a call from Steve 
Wilson,” Billings said. “He 
chewed me out. There is no doubt 
that official Washington — the 
White House at least — is solidly 
against us. When he gets around to 
it, Wilson will publicly brand us 
sensationalists. He brushed us 
off contemptuously in his press 



briefing this afternoon. That was 
before this silly crucifixion busi- 
ness. Next time around he'll blast 
us.” 

“But we have a lot of people 
with us. You go out to the coun- 
tryside, to the little towns — ” 

“Yes, I know. The rednecks. 
They’ll be for us, sure, but how 
long do you think it will take be- 
fore their opinion can have any 
impact? What about the influen- 
tial pastors in the big city churches? 
Can you imagine what the Rever- 
end Dr. Angus Windsor will tell 
his congregation and the news- 
papers and the world? He won't go 
along with solemn young men 
packing crosses through the street 
and getting crucified on a public 
square. For years I have tried to 
conduct my ministry with dig- 
nity and now it's been pulled down 
to the level of street brawling.” 
MacDonald protested. “We’ve 
used stunts before. Circus stuff. 
Show biz. They’re what you built 
the business on.” 

“But with restraint.” 

“Not too much restraint. Sky- 
writing and parades and miles of 
billboards—” 

“Legitimate advertising,” said 
Billings. “Honest advertising. A 
great American tradition. The 
mistake you made was to go out in 
the streets. You don’t know about 
the streets. You ran up against the 



156 



IF 




experts there. These Miocene 
kids know about the streets. They 
have been there — and have lived 
there. You had two strikes on you 
before you started out. What made 
you think you could compete with 
them?" 

"All right, then — what are we 
going to do? The streets are out, 
you say. So we pull off the streets. 
Then what do we do? How do we 
get attention?" 

Reverend Jake Billings stared at 
the wall through glassy eyes. "I 
don’t know," he said. "I purely do 
not know. I don’t think it makes 
much difference what we do. I 
think that gurgling noise you hear 
is our crusade going down the 
drain." 

42 . It was the dog that did it. 
Bentley Price hadn't had a drink all 
day. The road was narrow, wind- 
ing across the mountain, and 
Bentley, exasperated beyond 
endurance at what had happened 
to him, was driving faster than he 
should. After hours of hunting for 
it, he had finally found the army 
camp — a temporary stopping 
point by the looks of it, with none 
of the meticulous neatness of the 
military. It huddled in a dense 
patch of woods beside a stream 
that came brawling down the val- 
ley. Filled with a deep sense of duty 
done and perseverance paying 



off, Bentley had slung cameras 
around his neck and plodded 
toward the largest of the tents. 
The colonel had come out to stop 
his further progress. Who the hell 
are you, the colonel had asked, 
and where do you think you’re go- 
ing? I’m from Global News. Bent- 
ley had told him, and I am out here 
to take some pictures of this mon- 
ster hunt. I tell the city editor it 
isn’t worth the time, but he disa- 
grees with me and it’s no skin off 
my nose no matter where I’m sent, 
so leave us get the lead out and do 
some monster hunting so 1 can' 
get some pictures. 

You’re off limits, mister, the col- 
onel had told him. You are way off 
limits, in more ways than one. I 
don’t know how you got this far. 
Didn’t someone try to stop you? 
Sure, said Bentley, up the road a 
ways. A couple of soldier boys. 
But I pay no attention to them. I 
never pay attention to someone 
who tries to stop me. I got work to 
do and I can’t fool around. 

And then the colonel had thrown 
him out of there. He had spoken in 
a clipped, military voice and hrad 
been very icy-eyed. We’ve got trou- 
ble enough, he said, without some 
damn fool photographer muck- 
ing around and screwing up the 
detail. If you don’t leave under 
your own power I’ll have you es- 
corted out. While he was saying 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



157 




' this, Bentley snapped up a camera 
and took a picture of him. That 
made the situation even worse and 
Bentley, with his usual quick per- 
ception, could see his cause had 
failed. He had beaten a dignified 
retreat to avoid escort. Some of 
the soldiers had called out to him 
derisively. Bentley had slowed 
down momentarily, debating 
whether to go back and reason 
with them, then had thought better 
of it. They ain’t worth the time, he 
had told himself. 

Now the dog. 

The dog came bursting out of 
high weeds and brush that grew 
along the road. Its ears were laid 
back. Its tail was tucked in and it 
was kiyodeling in pure, blind pan- 
ic. The dog was close and Bentley 
was traveling much too fast. He 
jerked the wheel. The car veered off 
the road, smashed through a clump 
of brush. The tires screamed as 
Bentley hit the brakes. The nose of 
the car slammed hard into a huge 
walnut tree and stopped with a 
shuddering impact. The left- 
hand door flew open and Bentley, 
who held a lofty disdain for such 
copouts as seat belts, was thrown 
free. The camera he wore on a 
strap around his neck described a 
short arc and brought up against 
his ear, dealing him a blow that 
made his head ring as if there were 
a bell inside it. He landed on his 



back and rolled, wound up on 
hands and knees. He surged erect 
and found that he had ended up on 
the berm of the road. 

Standing in the middle of the 
road was a monster. Bentley 
recognized it — he had seen two of 
them only yesterday. But this one 
was small, no bigger than a Shet- 
land pony. Which did not mean the 
horror of it was any less. 

But Bentley was of different fi- 
ber than were other men. He did 
not gulp. His gut did not turn over. 
His hands came up with swift pre- 
cision, grabbed the camera firm- 
ly, brought it to his eye. The mon- 
ster was framed in the finder and 
his finger pressed the button. The 
camera clicked and as it clicked 
the monster disappeared. 

Bentley lowered the camera and 
let loose of it. His head still rang 
from the blow upon the ear. His 
clothes were torn — a gaping rent 
in a trouser leg revealed one knob- 
by knee. His right hand was bloody 
from where his palm had scraped 
across some gravel. Behind him 
the car creaked slightly as twisted 
metal settled slowly into place. The 
motor pinged and’sizzled as water 
from the broken radiator ran 
across hot metal. 

Off in the distance the still-run- 
ning dog was yipping frantically. 
In a tree up the hillside an excited 
squirrel chattered with machine- 



158 



IF 




gun intensity. The road was em|5- 
ty. A monster had been there. 
From where he stood Bentley 
could see its tracks printed in the 
dust. But it was no longer there. 

He limped out into the road, 
stared up and down it. There was 
nothing on the road. 

It was there, Bentley said stub- 
bornly to himself. I had it in the 
finder. It was there when I shot the 
picture. It wasn't until the shut- 
ter clicked that it disappeared. 
Doubt assailed him. Had the beast 
been there or not when he'd shot 
the picture? Was it on the film? 
Had he been robbed of a photo by 
the animal's disappearance? 

Thinking about it, it seemed to 
him that the monster had been in 
his viewfinder when he triggered 
the camera, but suddenly he 
could not be sure. 

He turned about and started 
limping down the road as rapidly 
as he could. There was one way to 
find out. He had to get to a phone, 
get another car. He must get back 
to Washington. 

43 . “We have made three con- 
tacts with the monsters," Sand- 
burg said. “There are yet to be re- 
sults. No one has had a chance to 
fire at them. They simply van- 
ish." 

“You mean," said Thornton 
William, “that they duck away 



when threatened. Some people 
have made more permanent con- 
tact." 

“No, I don't mean that they 
duck," Sandburg said. “They just 
cease to be there. The soldiers who 
saw them swore they didn’t move 
at all. They were there and then 
they weren't^ The observers, all 
reporting independently, not 
knowing of the other reports, 
have made identical statements. 
One man could be wrong in his ob- 
servation — it's possible that two 
could be. It seems impossible 
that three observers could err on 
exactly the same point." 

“Have you, has the military, any 
theory, any idea of what is going 
on?" 

“None," said Sandburg. “It 
must be a new defensive adapta- 
tion that they have developed. 
These creatures are fighting for 
survival. Cornered, I suppose 
that they would fight, but only if 
they had no way out. And ap- 
parently they have come up with 
something new. We have talked 
with Dr. Isaac Wolfe, the refugee 
biologist who probably knows 
more about these aliens than any 
other man — and this business is 
something he has never heard of. 
He suggests, simply as a guess, 
that the vanishing act may be 
only a juvenile capability — de- 
fense mechanism for the young. It 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



159 




may have gone unobserved until 
now because Dr. Wolfe and his 
people have had little opportu- 
nity to observe the juveniles — 
they had their hands full fighting 
off the adult aliens.” 

“How are you doing with get- 
ting men into the area?” asked the 
President. 

“I haven’t any figures,” said 
Sandburg, “but we’re piling them 
in as fast as we can move them. 
The refugee camps have formed 
their own governing committees 
and that takes off some of the pres- 
sure, frees some troops. The agri- 
culture and welfare agencies are 
handling transportation of food 
and other necessities to the refu- 
gees and that, too, has freed mili- 
tary personnel. We expect the 
first overseas transport planes to 
begin landing some time tonight 
and that will give us more men to 
work with.” 

“Morozov was in this morn- 
ing,” said Williams, “with an of- 
fer to supply us men. In fact, he 
rather insisted upon it. We, of 
course, rejected the offer. But it 
does raise a point. Should we, per- 
haps, ask for some assistance from 
Canada, perhaps Mexico, maybe 
Britain, France, Germany — 
or from some of the other friendly 
powers?” 

“Possibly we could use some of 
their forces,” said Sandburg. “I’d 



like to talk with the chiefs of staff 
and get their reactions. What we 
need, and haven’t been able to 
manage, are some rather substan- 
tial forces for both north and 
south — down in Georgia and in 
upstate New York. We should try 
to seal off the aliens’ spread, if they 
are spreading — and I suppose 
that is their intention. If we can 
contain them we can handle 
them.” 

“If they stand still,” said the 
President. 

“That is right,” said Sandburg. 
“If they stand still.” 

“Maybe we should move on to 
something else,” Henderson sug- 
gested. “Reilly, I think you have 
something to report.” 

“I’m not yet too solid on this,” 
said Reilly Douglas, “but it’s a 
matter that should be discussed. 
Frankly, I am inclined to think 
there may be a rather tricky legal 
question involved and I’ve had no 
chance to go into that aspect of it. 
Clinton Chapman came to see me 
last night. I think most of you 
know Clint.” 

He looked around the table. 
Many of the men rtodded. 

“He came to me,” said Doug- 
las, “and since then has phoned 
three o four times and we had 
lunch today. I suppose some of 
you know that we were room- 
mates at Harvard and have been 



160 



IF 




friends ever since. I suppose that’s 
why he contacted me. On his first 
approach he proposed that he — 
himself — would take over the 
building of the tunnels, finan- 
cing the cost with no federal funds 
involved. In return he would con- 
tinue in ownership of them once 
the future people had been trans- 
ported back to the Miocene and 
would be licensed to operate 
them. Since then — ” 

“Reilly,”^Williams interrupted, 
“I can’t quite understand why 
anyone would want to own them. 
What in the world could be done 
with them? The time force, or 
whatever it is, as I understand it, 
operates in only one direction — 
into the past.” 

Douglas shook his head. “Clint 
won’t buy that. He has talked with 
his research people — and the 
staff he has is probably one of the 
best in the world — and they have 
assured him that if there is such a 
thing as time travel it can be made 
to operate both into the past and 
into the future. As a matter of 
fact, they tdld him it would seem 
easier to operate it forward than 
into the past because time’s nat- 
ural flow is into the future.” 

Williams blew out a gusty 
breath. “I don’t know,” he said. 
“It has a dirty sound to it. Could 
we conscientiously turn over 
two-way travel through time — if 



such travel were possible — to 
any one man or any group of men? 
Think of the ways it could be 
used — ” 

“I talked to Clint about this at 
lunch,” said Douglas. “I ex- 
plained to him that any such opera- 
tion, if it were possible, would 
have to be very strictly con- 
trolled. Commissions would have 
to be set up to formulate a code — 
Congress would have to legislate. 
Not only that, but the code and the 
legislation would have to be 
worldwide — there would have to 
be some international agree- 
ment and you can imagine how 
long that might take. Clint agreed 
to all of this, said he realized it 
would be necessary. The man is 
quite obsessed wjth the idea. As an 
old friend, I tried to talk him out of 
it, but he still insists he wants to go 
ahead. If he is allowed to do it, 
that is. At first he planned to fi- 
nance it on his own — but ap- 
parently he is beginning to real- 
ize the kind of money that would be 
involved. As I understand it, he is 
now very quietly trying to put to- 
gether a consortium to take over 
the project.” 

Sandburg frowned. “I would say 
no on impulse. The potentials 
would have to be studied closely.” 

“There could be military appli- 
cations,” said Williams. “I’m not 
just sure what they would be.” 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



161 




“International agreements, with 
appropriate safeguards, would 
have to be set up to keep it from be- 
ing used militarily,” said the 
President. “And if these agree- 
ments should fail at any time in the 
future, I can’t see that it would 
make much difference who held 
the license. National needs would 
always take precedence. No mat- 
ter how it goes, rapid movement 
'through time seems to be some- 
thing we’re stuck with. It’s some- 
thing we have to face — and make 
the best of.” 

“You favor Clint’s proposal, 
Mr. President?” Douglas asked 
in some surprise. “When I talked 
with you — ” 

“I wouldn’t go so far as to say I 
favored it,” Henderson said.. 
“But under the conditions we face 
it seems to me we should consider 
all possibilities or proposals. We 
are going to be hard pressed to 
find the kind of money or credit 
that is needed to build the tun- 
nels. Not only we, but the world. 
Perhaps the rest of the world con- 
fronts more difficulties than we.” 

“That brings us to another 
point,” said Williams. “I suppose 
Chapman and his consortium 
are proposing to construct only 
the tunnels in the United States.” 

“I don’t know the extent of his 
plans,” Douglas said. “I would 
guess that Chapman’s consorti- 



um might include some foreign 
money. I can’t see a country like 
the Congo or Portugal or Indo- 
nesia turning its back on someone 
who wants to build its tunnels. 
Other nations might be hesitant, 
but if we went along with the plan 
and a couple of the other major 
nations joined us — say Germany 
or France — most of the others 
would follow. Nobody would 
want to be left out.” 

“This is going to cost a lot of 
money,” Secretary of the Treas- 
ury Manfred Franklin put in. 
“Tunnels for the entire world 
would run into billions.” 

“There are gamblers in the fi- 
nancial world,” observed Ben 
Cunningham, of Agriculture. 
“But mostly theirs is what is 
known as smart money. Chapman 
must be fairly sure of his bets. Do 
you imagine he may know some- 
thing we don’t know?” 

Douglas shook his head. “I am 
inclined to think not. His RD 
people are good, but they’re only 
theorizing that time travel has to 
be a two-way street. Practical ap- 
plication so far says no. But even 
that is the first new’jdea — the first 
really . new idea with genuine tech- 
nological and engineering potential 
— that has come along in fifty 
years or more. Clint and his gang 
understandably want to get in on 
the ground floor.”

IF 




"‘The question,” said Williams, 
“is whether or not we should let 
them.” 

“Much as we may regret to do 
so,” said the President, “we may 
have to. Or word would be leaked 
to the public and you can imagine 
what the taxpayers’ reaction 
would be. Frankly, gentlemen, we 
may Find ourselves in a position 
where opposing the consortium 
would be political suicide.” 

“You don’t seem to be too upset 
about it,” Williams said some- 
what acidly. 

“When you have been in politics 
as long as I, Thornton, you don’t 
gag too easily at anything that 
comes up. You learn to be practi- 
cal. There are times when you 
simply cannot take potshots at 
Santa Claus.” 

“I still don’t like it,” said Wil- 
liams. 

“Nor do 1,” said Sandburg. 

“Letting Chapman go ahead 
would be a solution,” said Frank- 
lin. “Labor is ready to join us in 
the emergency. If the financial 
interests of the world would also 
go along — which is actually what • 
would happen under this consorti- 
um setup — our basics would be 
settled. We still have to feed the 
refugees, but I understand we 
can do that longer than we had 
thought at first. Supplying them 
with what they’ll need to establish 



themselves in their new start can 
be done at a fraction of the tunnel 
costs. Someone will have to do 
some rather rapid planning to 
calculate how much of our manu- 
facturing processes and re- 
sources will have to be converted 
for a time to the making of wheel- 
barrows, hoes, axes, plows and 
other similar items, but that’s 
simply a matter of computer 
time. The job may pinch us a bit, 
but it can be done. The tunnels are 
the big challenge and Chapman’s 
consortium will do the job there if 
we let them.” 

“How about all those banner- 
carrying kids who say they want to 
go back in time?” asked Cunning- 
ham. “I say let them go. It would 
clear the streets of them and for a 
long time a lot of people have been 
yelling about population pres- 
sure. We may have the answer 
here.” 

“You’re being facetious, of 
course,’’ said the President, 
“but—” 

“I can assure you, sir. I’m not in 
the least facetious. I mean it.” 

“And I agree with your main po- 
sition,’’ Henderson said. “My 
reasons may not be yours, but I do 
think we should not try to stop any- 
one who wants to leave us. But be- 
fore we allow them to go they 
must have the same ecological 
sense and convictions the future 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



163 




people have. We can’t send back 
people who’ll use up the resources 
we already have used. That would 
make a paradox I don’t pretend 
to understand, but I imagine it 
might be fatal to our civilization.” 
“Who would teach them this 
ecological sense and convic- 
tion?” 

“The refugees. They don’t all 
need to go back into the past im- 
mediately. In fact, they have of- 
fered to leave a group of special- 
ists with us who will teach us much 
of the knowledge of the next five 
hundred years — as much of it as 
we can assimilate. I think this of- 
fer should be accepted.” 

“So do I,” said Williams. 
“Some economic and social ap- 
plecarts will be upset, but in the 
long run we should be way out in 
front. In twenty years or less we 
could jump five hundred years 
ahead — without making the mis- 
takes our descendants on the old 
world line made.” 

“I don’t know about that,” said 
Douglas. “There are too many 
factors involved. I’d have to think 
about that for a while.” 

“We are forgetting one thing,” 
Sandburg said. “We can go ahead 
and plan, of course. And we have 
to do it fast. We have to be well 
along to a working solution in a 
month or so or time will begin 
running out. But the point I want 



to make is this — the solution, the 
planning may do us little good if 
we aren’t able to wipe out, or at 
least control, the aliens.” 

44 . The kids out in the street 
might be the ones, Wilson told 
himself, with the right idea. He 
could understand their fascina- 
tion with the concept of starting 
over once again — the slate wiped 
clean and the record clear. Only 
trouble was, he thought, that even 
starting over, the human race 
might still repeat many of its past 
mistakes — perhaps in some dif- 
ferent form. Then again, maybe 
not. It would take some time to 
make old errors and there would at 
least be the opportunity, if the 
will were there, to correct them 
before they got too big, too en- 
trenched and awkward. 

Alice Gale had talked about a 
wilderness where the White 
House once had stood and Dr. Os- 
borne, on the ride from Fort Myer 
to the White House, had expressed 
his doubt that the trend that had 
made the White House park a wil- 
derness could be stopped — it had 
gone too far, he had said. You are 
too top-heavy, h<s had said — you 
are off balance. 

Perhaps the trend had gone too 
far, Wilson admitted to him- 
self — big government w^s grow- 
ing bigger; big business was grow- 



164 



IF 




ing fatter and more arrogant; 
taxes were steadily rising, never 
going down; the poor were be- 
coming ever poorer and increas- 
ing in numbers despite the best in- 
tentions of a welfare-conscious 
society; the gap between the rich 
and poor, the government and the 
public was becoming wider by 
the year. How could it have been 
done differently, he wondered. 
Given the kind of world Earth was, 
how could circumstances have 
been better ordered? 

He shook his head. He had no 
idea. There might be men who 
could go back and chart the politi- 
cal, economic and social growth 
and show where the errors had 
been made, putting their fingers 
on certain actions in a certain 
year and saying here is where we 
made this error. But the men who 
could do this were theorists work- 
ing on the basis of ideas, many of 
which could not stand the test of 
application. 

The phone on his desk rang and 
he picked it up. 

“Mr. Wilson?" 

“Yes." 

“This is the guard at the south- 
west gate. There is a gentleman 
here who says that he must see you 
on a matter of importance. Mr. 
Thomas Manning. Mr. Bentley 
Price is with him. Do you know 
them, sir?" 



“Yes. Please send them in." 

“I'll send an escort with them, 
sir. You'll be in your office?" 

“Yes. I'll wait here for them." 

Wilson dropped the receiver 
back into its cradle. What could 
bring Manning here? Why should 
he have to come in person? A mat- 
ter of importance, he had said. 
And Bentley — for the love of 
God, why Bentley? 

Was it, he wondered, something 
further about the U. N. business? 

He looked at his watch. The 
cabinet meeting was taking long- 
er than he had thought it would. 
Maybe it was over and the Presi- 
dent had become busy with other 
matters. Although that would be 
strange — Kim ordinarily would 
have squeezed Steve in. 

Manning and Bentley came into 
the room. The guard stopped at the 
door. Wilson nodded at him. 

“It’s all right. You can wait out- 
side. This is an unexpected plea- 
sure," he said to the two, shaking 
their hands. “I seldom see you, 
Tom. And Bentley. I almost 
never see you." 

“I got business elsewhere," 
Bentley said. “I get my legs run 
off. I'm running all the time." 

“Bentley just got in from West 
Virginia," Manning said. “That's 
what this visit is about." 

"There was this dog in the 
road," said Bentley, “and then a 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



165 




nearby tree came up and hit me.” 

“Bentley took a picture of a 
monster standing in the road/’ 
said Manning, “just as it disap- 
peared.” 

“I got her figured now,” said 
Bentley. “It saw the camera 
pointed at it and it heard it click. 
Them monsters don’t stay around 
when they see something pointed 
at them.” 

“There have been other reports 
of their disappearing,” Wilson 
said. “A defense mechanism of 
some sort, perhaps. It’s making it 
tough for the boys out hunting 
them.” 

“I don’t think so,” said Man- 
ning. “Forcing them to disap- 
pear may be as good as hunting 
them.” 

He unzipped a thin briefcase he 
was carrying and took out a sheaf 
of photos. “Look at this,” he said. 

He slid the top photo across the 
desk to Wilson. 

Wilson took a quick look, then 
fixed his gaze on Bentley. “What 
kind of trick photography is 
this?” he asked. 

“There ain’t no tricks,” said 
Bentley. “A camera never lies. It 
always tells the truth. It shows you 
what is there. That’s what really 
happens when a monster disap- 
pears. I was using a fast film — ” 

“But dinosaurs!” yelled Wilson. 

Bentley’s hand dipped into his 



pocket and brought out an object. 
He handed it to Wilson. “A 
glass,” he said. “Take a look with 
it. There are herds of them off in 
the distance. You can’t do tricks 
of that sort.” 

The monster was hazed, a sort of 
shadow monster, but substan- 
tial enough for there to be no doubt 
it was an alien. Behind it the dino- 
saurs, three of them, were in sharp 
focus. 

“Duckbills,” said Manning. “If 
you showed that photograph to a 
paleontolqgist, I have every ex- 
pectation he could give you an ex- 
act identification.” 

The trees were strange. Some 
looked like palms, others like gi- 
gantic ferns. 

Wilson unfolded the magnifier, 
bent his head close above the pho- 
to, shifted the glass about. Bent- 
ley had been right. There were 
other strange creatures spread 
across the landscape, herds of 
them, singles, pairs. A small 
mammal of some sort cowered 
under a shrub. 

“We have some blowups,” Man- 
ning said, “of the background. 
Want to look at them?” 

Wilson shook his head. “No. I'm 
satisfied.” 

“We looked it up in a geology 
book, said Bentley. “That there 
is a Cretaceous landscape.” 

“Yes, I know,” said Wilson. 



166 



IF 




He reached for the phone. 
“Kim," he said, “is Mr. Gale in his 
room? Thank you. Please 'ask him 
to step down." 

Manning laid the rest of the pho- 
tos on the desk. “They are yours," 
he said. “We'll be putting them on 
the wire. We wanted you to know 
first. You thinking the same thing 
that I am?" 

Wilson nodded. “I suppose I 
am," he said, “but no quotation, 
please." 

“We don't need quotes," said 
Manning. “The picture tells the 
story. The monster, the mother 
monster, I would suppose you'd 
call it, was exposed to the time 
travel principle when it came 
through the tunnel. The principle 
was imprinted on its mind, its in- 
stinct, whatever you may call it. It 
transmitted knowledge of the 
principle to the young — a he- 
reditary instinct." 

“But it took time tunnels, me- 
chanical contraptions, for the 
humans to do it," Wilson ob- 
jected. “It took technology and 
engineering — " 

Manning shrugged. “Hell, 
Steve, I don't know. I don't pre- 
tend to know. But the photo says 
the monsters are escaping to an- 
other time. Maybe they'll all es- 
cape to another time, probably to 
the same time. The escape time 
bracket may be implanted on 



their instinct. Maybe the Creta- 
ceous is a better place for* them. 
Maybe they have found this era 
too tough for them to crack, the 
odds too great." 

“I just thought of something," 
said Wilson. “The dinosaurs died 
out—" 

“Yeah, I know," said Manning. 
He zipped the briefcase shut. “We 
better go," he said. “We have 
work to do. Thanks for seeing us." 

“No, Tom," said Wilson. “The 
thanks are to you and Bentley. 
Thanks for coming over. It might 
have taken days to get this puz- 
zled out. If we ever did — " 

He stood and watched them go, 
then sat down again. 

It was incredible, he thought. 
Yet it did make a lopsided sort of 
sense. Humans were too prone to 
think in human grooves. Aliens 
would be different. Again and 
again the refugees from the future 
had emphasized the creatures 
must not be regarded as simple 
monsters, but rather as highly in- 
telligent beings. And that intelli- 
gence, no doubt, would be as alien 
as their bodies. Their intelligence 
and ability would not duplicate 
human intelligence and ability. 
Hard as it might be to understand, 
they might be able to do by in- 
stinct what humans would need a 
machine to accomplish. 

Maynard Gale and Alice came 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



167 




into the room so quietly that he 
did not know they were there until 
he looked up and saw them stand- 
ing beside the desk. 

“You asked for us,” said Gale. 

“I wanted you to look at these,” 
said Wilson. “The top one first. 
The others are detail blowups. 
Tell me what you think.” 

He waited while they studied 
the photos. Finally Gale said, 
“This is the Cretaceous, Mr. Wil- 
son. How was the photo taken? 
And what has the monster to do 
with it?” 

“The photographer was taking a 
picture of the monster. As he 
took it — at the moment he took 
it — the monster disappeared.” 

“The monster disappeared?” 
“This is the second — or third or 
fourth — report of one disap- 
pearing. The second that I know 
of. There may have been others. I 
don’t know.” 

“Yes,” said Gale, “I suppose 
that it is possible. They’re not like, 
us, you know. The one that came 
through the tunnel experienced 
time travel — an experience that 
would have lasted for only a frac- 
tion of a second. But that may 
have been enough.” He shuddered. 
“If that is true — if after such an 
exposure they are able to travel 
independently in time, if their 
progeny is able to travel inde- 
pendently in time, if they can sense 



and learn and master such a com- 
plex thing so well, so quickly, it’s a 
wonder that we were able to stand 
up against them for these twenty 
years. They must have been play- 
ing with us, keeping us, protect- 
ing us for their sport. A game pre- 
serve. That is what we must have 
been. A game preserve.” 

“You can’t be sure of that,” said 
Wilson. 

“No, I suppose not. Dr. Wolfe is 
the man you should consult about 
this. He would know. At least he 
could make an educated guess.” 

“But you have no doubt?” 

“None,” said Gale. “This could 
be a hoax?” 

Wilson shook his head. “Not 
Tom Manning. We know one an- 
other well. We worked on the Post , 
right here, together. We were 
drinking companions. We were 
brothers until this damn job came 
between us. Not that he has no 
sense of humor. But he wouldn’t 
use it in a thing like this. And Bent- 
ley? The camera is his god. He 
wouldn’t use it for an unworthy 
purpose. He lives and breathes his 
cameras. He bows down before 
them each night before he goes to 
bed.” 

“So we have evidence the aliens 
flee into the past — even as we 
fled.” 

“I think so,” said Wilson. “I 
wanted your opinion. You know 



168 



IF 




these creatures and we do not.” 
“You’ll still talk with Wolfe?” 
“Yes, we’ll do that.” 

“There is another matter, Mr. 
Wilson, that we have wanted to 
talk with you about. My daughter 
and I have talked it over and we are 
agreed,” 

“What is that?” asked Wilson. 
“An invitation,” said Gale. 
“We're not sure you will accept. 
Perhaps you won’t. We may even 
offend you with it. But many other 
people, I think, would accept the 
invitation. To many it would have 
a great attraction. I find it rather 
awkward to phrase it, but it is this: 
When we go back into the Mio- 
cene — if you wished to do so you 
would be welcome to go along 
with us. With our particular 
group. We should be glad to have 
you.” 

Wilson did not move. He tried to 
find words and could not. 

Alice said, “You were ourjirst 
friend, perhaps our only real 
friend. You arranged the matter 
of the diamonds. You have done 
so many things.” 

She stepped quickly around the 
desk,.* bent to kiss him on the 
cheek. 

“We do not need an answer 
now,” said Gale. “You will want to 
think about it. If you decide not to 
go with us we'll not speak of this 
again. The invitation, I think, is 



issued with the knowledge that in 
all probability, your people will 
be using the time tunnels to go 
back into an era some millions of 
years in the past. I have the feeling 
you will not be able to escape the 
crisis that overtook our ances- 
tors (I refer to you, of course) on 
the original time track.” 

“I don’t know,” said Wilson. “I 
honestly do not know. You will let 
me think about it.” 

“Certainly,” said Gale. 

Alice bent close, her words a 
whispers. “I do so hope you’ll de- 
cide to come with us,” she said. 

Then they were gone as silently 
and unobtrustively as they had 
come. 

Dusk was creeping into the 
room. In the press lounge a type- 
writer clicked hesitantly as the 
writer sought words. Against the 
wall the teletypes muttered 
querulously. One button on 
Judy’s phone console kept flash- 
ing — not Judy’s console any 
more, he thought. Judy was gone. 
The plane that was taking her to 
Ohio was already heading west- 
ward. 

Judy, he said to himself. For the 
love of God, what got into you? 
Why did you have to do it? 

He would be lonely without her, 
he knew. He had not known until 
now, he realized, how much she 
had kept him from feeling alone. 



OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 



169 




She had not needed to be with 
him — the mere thought that she 
was somewhere nearby had been 
quite enough to bring gladness to 
his heart. 

She still would be near, he 
thought. Ohio was not far — in this 
day no place on Earth was distant. 
Phones still worked and letters 
went by mail, but there was a dif- 
ference now. He thought of how 
he might phrase a letter if he wrote 
to her, but he knew he would never 
write. 

The phone rang. Kim said, “The 
meeting’s over. He can see you 
now.’’ 

45 . “Thank you, Kim,’’ said 
Wilson. That he had asked to see

mind. So much had happened 
since. 

When he entered the office the 
President said, “I’m sorry you 
were kept waiting, Steve. There 
was so much that had to be talked 
over. What do you have?" 

Wilson grinned. “Nothing quite 
as grim as what I had when I tried 
to reach you earlier. I think the 
situation is better now. There was 
a rumor out of the U. N." 

“This Russian business?" 

“Yes, the Russian business. Tom 
Manning, phoned. His U. N. 
man — Max Hale, you know him?’’ 

“1 don’t think I’ve ever met him. 
I read him. He is sound." 

“Hale heard that the Russians 
would push for the international 
dropping of nuclear weapons on 
the areas where the monsters 
might be." 

“I had expected something of 
that sort," said the President. 
“They’d never be able to pull it 
off." 

“I think the question is academ- 
ic now anyhow," said Wilson. 
“These just came in." He laid the 
photos on the desk. "Bentley 
Price took the shot." 

“Price," said the President. “Is 
he the one — " 

“He's the one all the stories are 
about. Drunk a good part of the 
time, but a topnotch photogra- 
pher. The best there is." 



170 



IF 





The President studied the first 
photo, frowning. “Steve, I'm not 
sure I understand this." 

“There's a story that goes with 
it sir. It goes something like this — " 

The President listened closely, 
not interrupting. When Wilson 
finished he asked, “You really 
think that's the explanation, 
Steve?" 

“I'm inclined to think so, sir. So 
does Gale. He said we should talk 
with Wolfe. But there was no ques- 
tion in Gale's mind. All we have to 
do is keep pushing them. Push 
enough of them into the past and 
the rest will go. If there were more 
of them — if we had as few weap- 
ons as the people of five hundred 
years from now had when they first 
reached liarth — they probably 
would try to stay on here. We'd 
offer plenty of fighting, be worthy 
antagonists. But I think they may 
know when they are licked. And 
back in the Cretaceous, they'll 
still have worthy opponents. For- 
midable ones. Tyrannosaurus 
rex and all his relatives. The tri- 
ceratops. The coelurosaurs. The 
hunting dinosaurs. Hand-to-hand 
combat, face-to-face. They might 
like that better than what humans 
have to offer. More glory in it for 
them." 

The President sat thoughtfully 
silent. Then he said, “As I recol- 
lect, the scientists have never fig- 



ured out what killed off the dino- 
saurs. Maybe now we know." 

“That could be," said Wilson. 

Henderson reached for the call 
box, then pulled back his hand. 

“No," he said. “Fyodor Moro- 
zov is a decent sort of man. What 
he did this morning was in the line 
of duty— he had to carry out or- 
ders. No use phoning him. He’ll 
find out when the picture hits the 
street. So will the people at the 
U.N. I’d like to see their faces. I’d 
say it spikes their guns." 

“I would say so, sir," said Wil- 
son. “I’ll take no more of your 
time—’’ 

“Stay for a minute, Steve. 
There’s something you should 
know. A sort of precautionary 
knowledge. The question may 
come up and you should know how 
to field it. No more than a half- 
dozen of our people — all scient- 
ists — know this and they won’t 
talk. Neither will the future 
people. ^There is no record. State 
doesn't know. Defense doesn’t 
know." 

“I wonder, sir, if I should—’’ 

“I want you to know," said the 
President. “Once you hear it you 
are bound by the same secrecy as 
the others. You’ve heard of the 
Clinton Chapman proposal?" 

“I have heard of it. I don’t like 
it. The question came up this 
morning and I refused comment.

Said it was only rumor and I had 
no knowledge of it.” 

“Neither do I like it,” said the 
President. “But as far as I am 
concerned he’s going to be en- 
couraged to go ahead. He thinks 
he can buy time travel — thinks he 
has it in his hand. He can fairly 
taste it. I have never seen a more 
obvious case of naked greed. I’m 
not too sure his great good friend, 
Reilly Douglas, may not have a 
touch of that same greed.” 

“But if it’s greed — ” 

“It’s greed, all right,” said the 
President. “But I know some- 
thing he doesn’t know and if I can 
manage it, he won’t know it until 
it’s too late to do him any good. 
And that is this: What the future 
people used was not time travel as 
we think of it — it is something 
else. It serves the same purpose, 
but it’s not time travel as tradi- 
tionally conceived. I don’t know 
if I can explain this too well, but it 
seems there is another universe, 
coexistent with ours. The people 
of the future know it’s there, but 
there is only one thing they really 
know about it. That is that the 
direction of time’s flow in the sec- 
ond universe is exactly the oppo- 
site of ours. Its future flows 
toward our past. The people of the 
future traveled into their past by 
hooking onto the future flow of 
this other universe — ” 



“But that means you can travel 
in only one direction.” 

“Exactly,” said the President. 

“It means that you can go into the 
past, but you can’t come back.” 

“If Chapman knew this the deal 
would be off.” 

“I suppose it would be. He’s not 
proposing to build the tunnels 
from patriotic motives. He’s been 
told, of course, that the tunnels 
work only one way, but he doesn’t 
know why. Do you think badly of 
me, Steve, for my deception — 
my calculated dishonesty?” 

“I’d think badly of you, sir, if 
there really were a chance for 
Chapman to do what he means to 
do and you did not stop him. This 
way, however the world gets help 
and the only ones who are hurt are 
men who, for once, will have over- 
reached themselves. No one will 
feel sorry for them.” 

“Some day,” Henderson said, 
“it will be known. Some day my 
dishonesty will catch up with 
me.” 

“When it does,” said Wilson, “a 
great guffaw will go around the 
world. You’ll be famous, sir. 
They’ll build statues of you.” 

The President smiled. “I hope 
so, Steve. I feel a little sneaky.” 
“One thing, sir,” said Wilson. 
“Just how tight is this secret of 
yours?” 

“I feel it’s solid,” said the Presi-

dent. “The people you brought up 
from Myer told our National 
Academy people — only three of 
them. The future scientists and 
the men who talked with them re- 
ported back to me. To me alone. 
By this time, I had gotten wind of 
Chapman’s deal and I asked them 
to say nothing. Only a few of the 
refugee scientists worked on the 
project that sent the people 
back — only a handful of them 
know what is actually involved. 
And, as it happens, they all are 
here in the United States. Some- 
thing like the diamonds. They all 
are here because they felt we were 
the one nation they could trust. 
The word has been passed along at 
Myer. The future scientists 
won’t talk. Neither will our men.” 
Wilson nodded. “It sounds all 
right. You mentioned the dia- 
monds. What became of them?” 
“We have accepted temporary 
custody. They are locked away. 
Later, after all of this is over, 
we’ll see what can be done with 
them. Probably discreet sales will 
dispose of them, with a suitable 
cover story provided. The money 
will be put in escrow for later dis- 
tribution to other nations.” 

Wilson rose and moved toward 
the door. Halfway there, he 
stopped and turned. “I’d say, Mr. 
President, that things are going 
very well.” 



“Yes,” said the President. “Af- 
ter a bad start events are moving 
well. There’s still a lot to do, but we 
are on the way.” 

Someone was at Judy’s desk 
when Wilson returned. The room 
was dark. There were only the 
flashing lights on the console and 
they were not being answered. 

“Judy?” Wilson asked hesitant- 
ly. “Judy, is that you?” Knowing 
that it couldn’t be, for by now she 
was probably landing in Ohio. 

“I came back,” said Judy. 4 T got 
on the plane and then got off again. 
I sat at the airport for hours, won- 
dering what to do. You are a son 
of a bitch, Steve Wilson, and you 
know you are. I don’t know why I 
got off the plane. Getting off, I 
don’t know why I came here.” 

He strode across the room and 
stood beside her. 

“But, Judy—” 

Judy pouted. “You never asked 
me Jo stay. You never really asked 
me.” 

“But I did. I asked you.” 

“You were noble about it. That’s 
the trouble with you. Noble. You 
never got down on your knees and 
begged me. And now my baggage 
is headed for Ohio and I — ” 

He reached down and lifted her 
from the chair, held her close. 

“It’s been a rough two days,” he 
said. “It’s time for the two of us to 
be going home.” •

azines. Now , lo, he appeareth in color 
no longer. ( Take a look at May 73 
Galaxy — Ed.) 

Another point: I am afraid that I 
cannot find words for the story in Gal- 
axy (March 73) titled The Girl And 
The Dolphin. Those animals are real- 
ly that smart , hunh? Still , I must say 
the story was out of the ordin- 
ary — and I must congratulate Frank 
Herbert on his novel, Project Forty. / 
read it in one evening and found it 
amazing. 

Re The Wizard of Anharitte — / 
didn't place this novel as Kapp's 
Patterns of Chaos on my favorite 
story list. The Wizard lacked the color 
of Patters — it was an interesting 
yarn all the same. 

Keep up the good work. I'm about to 
read Doomship now — and I know you 
won't let me down. 

Will you? 

R. E. Grehan 
Memphis, Tenn. 

With a Fred Pohl/Jack Williamson 
collaboration? And you’re asking? 

Dear Mr. Jakobbson: 

The cover illustration of the April 
Worlds of If was the best I've seen in a 
long time — it was better than any of 
Brian Boyle's three Project 40 covers 
for Galaxy Magazine or most of his 
paintings up to now. Very, very 
good — have Mr. Boyle keep it up. 

The best feature in this issue was 
Doomship, another Pohl/ William- 
son masterwork, extensively fla- 
vored by Jack Williamson's whole- 
some and identifiable human char- 
acterizations — his most attractive 



trademark, I think. 

The Wizard of Anharitte, which re- 
ceived such heavy praise from Tony 
Lewis in Locus, was equal to the pre- 
vious parts published in If. 

Next Time and Call Me Proteus 
were also enjoyable. 

I'd like to suggest, though, that in- 
stead of running serial installments 
every month you forget about serials 
entirely and try to include a novella, 
a couple of novelettes and as many 
short stories as you can in each issue. 

In view of the competition you still 
have to try harder! And I'll be boost- 
ing you all the way. 

Lester Boutillier 
New Orleans, La. 

Good science fiction, the best we 
can find at any length in wordage, is 
what we’ve wanted and will continue 
to want for Galaxy/If — I -can say 
most emphatically and with total 
sincerity that I have never turned 
xlown for purely mechanical rea- 
sons a work of fiction that I’ve liked. 

You may see — if you look through 
back issues — that we often com- 
press type to get in all that we want. 
And sometimes departmental ma- 
terial or art work is squeezed. 

.Both If and Galaxy are, first of all, 
science fiction magazines. 

Competition is a lovely game and 
good fun and every criticism hurts 
and is noted. But every publication 
in the field should serve the field, hope- 
fully add to it. Perfection is beyond 
most of us— but the unforgivable 
lapse would be to be of disservice to 
the field, as mindless competition 
for its own sake would make us. 

We’re going to try harder — we al- 
ways do. But both If and Galaxy re- 
main open to all lengths of good, pre-

viously unpublished fiction — with* 
in reason — available to them. 

Besides, the magazine graveyards 
are haunted by ghosts — many of 
them once vital and lovely — who 
went to their ends as mechanical 
marvels, their services finished. 

All boosts, of course, are gratefully 
received — as are all helpful sugges- 
tions as to how we can best serve. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson : 

I have been trying to locate a short 
story I read some years ago ( ten to fif- 
teen years — or more), but have been 
hampered by the fact that I don’t re- 
member the name of the author or of 
the magazine in which the story ap- 
peared. 

The title of the story was Native 
Problem and the plot ran as follows: 

A man named Danton claims a 
planet. This comes about because at 
the time of the story it is possible to 
reach any point in the galaxy in a short 
period of time through a faster-than - 
light drive — and the galaxy is filled 
{ relatively ) with uninhabited. 

Earthlike planets. 

He is transported to his planet and 
left to fend for himself. 

Shortly afterward another space- 
ship arrives, carrying a group of re- 
ligious pilgrims. The ship is of an- 
cient design, has no FTL drive and has 
been in transit for centuries. No one 
on the ship has even set foot on a plan- 
etary surface, but the group s proph- 
ets have designated Danton s world 
as their promised land. 

In the ensuing encounter with Dan- 
ton the pilgrims refuse to listen to his 
explanations for his presence, but 
insist on considering him merely 
one of the natives to be subdued 



and I or converted. 

How Danton ends up as " the last of 
the natives " with the pilgrims estab- 
lished on the planet is a hilarious 
comment on the peculiar blindness 
we know as bigotry. y 

If you or anyone on your staff is fa- 
miliar with this story, could you please 
jot down the name of the author or of 
the magazine in which the story ap- 
peared and send it to me in the en- 
closed envelope? 

Thank you.
