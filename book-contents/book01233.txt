SUPPLY TRAIN ON THE MOON — Loaded with radio, television and electri- 
cal power equipment, a huge atomic-powered caterpillar train crawls out of a 
crater's shadow up into the sunlight, on its way to the site where a Moon 
base is under construction. After communication and power equipment 
are on their way, food and prefabricated housing units are unloaded from 
the two shuttle ships seen in the distance on the crater's floor. Now turn 
to inside back cover.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

WHAT WILL LIFE in America be 
like 100 years from now? 

That is the theme of IF’s first 
Collegiate Science Fiction Contest 
which was announced last fall. 
Participants are limited to under- 
graduates in colleges in the United 
States and Canada, and the object 
is three fold : to introduce IF to 
new readers; stimulate interest in 
science fiction among young men 
and women, who will be the Amer- 
ica of tomorrow; and to get their 
ideas and opinions, which are to 
be expressed in novelette form of 
approximately 10,000 words. The 
curtain falls next month, midnight 
May 15th to be exact, and there are 
prizes totaling $2,000. 

Writing ability is being consid- 
ered, but of primary concern are 
ideas and imagination. Politics, 
science, literature, economics, se- 
mantics, sports, medicine — any 
classroom subject or personal ones 



— may be used as a background; 
the scene : any city, village farm or 
other place in America. There are 
no taboos and the only limitation 
is the author’s imagination. 

Well, manuscripts have begun to 
trickle in. How many we will re- 
ceive before the deadline is hard to 
tell but, judging from enquiries re- 
ceived since last November, there 
will be many more than antici- 
pated. The response is not only en- 
couraging, from the standpoint of a 
successful contest, but to see so 
many young people curious and 
anxious to express their opinions 
and speculations about what their 
country will be like a century from 
now. As one young man from Seat- 
tle, Washington, expressed it: “I 
have several ideas running around 
in my head ... It will be fun to 
kick this thing around.” 

None of the entrees will be 
judged, of course, until after the 
contest closes, but from brief scan- 
ning of early returns space travel, 
government, electronics, synthetics 
and human relations seem to be the 
most popular subjects. 

One of the stories predicts an 
American Empire, consisting of 
North and South America, as one 
of three nations existing on earth a 
century from now. It seems that the 
United States, diluted with social- 
ism and communism, is saved from 
becoming a Soviet puppet state 
(about 1984) by a man with the 
soldiery of General MacArthur, 
the economic judgment of Her- 
bert Hoover and the oratory of 
William Jennings Bryan. Another 
story tells of a United States sub- 
sisting on synthetics while a vast 
program, under military supervi- 




sion, is being conducted to rehabili- 
tate our natural resources; still an- 
other contestant prophesizes the 
human life span to be 125 years, 
with the cure of cancer as common 
as that of pneumonia is today. 

So — the ideas are coming thick 
and fast already. What their diver- 
sity will be when all submissions are 
in and we start judging is any- 
body’s guess. But one thing is sure: 
it’s going to be an exciting, fasci- 
nating, and thought-provoking 
journey into what young America 
is thinking today about tomorrow. 
And if you want to see what the 
winners predict, don’t miss the No- 
vember and December issues — you 
are in for a real treat. 

WHEN RADIO first made its ap- 
pearance with the old crystal sets 
back in the middle twenties and 
grew with leaps and bounds up 
through the thirties and forties, it 
never did seem to attain the de- 
gree of popularity that television 
has received in the relatively few 
years since you got a flickering pic- 
ture over a “seven-inch” set. 

In less than ten years TV has be- 
come something of a home life so- 
cial problem as well as a source of 
entertainment. People build on 
special rooms or re-do attics or cel- 
lars. They buy special chairs, tables, 
lamps, ash trays, etc. Dad stays 
home at night and Mother lets the 
dishes go until morning. The small 
fry either forget or won’t do their 
homework, they refuse to come to 
meals until the last redskin has bit 
the dust, and that errand you want 
them to do can wait until Space 
Captain Carson has safely landed 
his ship on the Moon. In many 



cases they have taken over the fam- 
ily TV completely. 

However, there may soon come 
a time when television will have the 
exact opposite effect — on the small 
fry, anyway. Junior will jump the 
minute you call him, he will never 
hesitate to do an errand, he will 
rush into his meals! Well . ? 

Television is not only a medium 
of entertainment. It is used by the 
Signal Corps to study battle prob- 
lems. It is the “eyes” of the opera- 
tor of machines that detonate and 
disassemble bombs. It is equipment 
in industry where machinery per- 
forms robot operations untenable 
by man. It is a medium of instruc- 
tion. ! 

Now we have it! Perhaps it won’t 
be too long before school is con- 
ducted by television — right in your 
own home. All you have to do is 
put Junior in front of the set, turn 
it on at “bell time” and he’ll get his 
readin’, writin’, and ’rithmetic 
without even going out of doors. 
He’s gonna be told to wash his face 
and hands, do his home work, do 
this and that. He’s gonna get so 
much schoolin’ that he’ll be happy 
to do anything to get a “recess”. 

So — once TV school starts, par- 
ents will get back their sets, ring- 
side seats and domestic peace. 

By the way, have you got your 
color set yet? If not, and that $700- 
$1,000 price is keeping you from 
one, don’t let it worry you. RCA is 
sending out color that you can pick 
up — in black-and-white — on your 
present set without adapters or 
gadgets. So, you can wait until 
color comes down to your budget. 

A long, long and fast, fast way 
from Marconi and Bell. — jlq 




If historical precedent be wrong — what qualities, then, must 
man possess to successfully colonize new worlds? Doctor Ashby 
said: “There is no piece of data you cannot find, provided you 
can devise the proper experimental procedure for turning it 
up.” Now — about the man and the procedure .

T HIS WAS the rainy year. Last 
year had been the dry one, and 
it would come again. But they 
wouldn’t be here to see it, Captain 
Louis Carnahan thought. They 
had seen four dry ones, and now 
had come the fourth wet one, and 
soon they would be going home. 
For them, this was the end of the 
cycle. 

At first they had kept track of 
the days, checking each one off on 
their calendars, but the calendars 
had long since been mingled in- 



distinguishably with the stuff of the 
planet itself — along with most of 
the rest of their equipment. By that 
time, however, they had learned 
that the cycle of wet and dry sea- 
sons was almost precisely equiva- 
lent to a pair of their own Terran 
years, so they had no more need for 
the calendars. 

But at the beginning of this wet 
season Carnahan had begun mark- 
ing off the days once again with 
scratches on the post of the hut in 
which he lived. The chronometers 




6 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



were gone, too, but one and three- 
quarters Earth days equalled one 
Serrengian day, and by that he 
could compute when the ships from 
Earth were due. 

He had dug moats about the hut 
to keep rain water from coming in 
over his dirt floor. Only two of the 
walls were erected, and he didn’t 
know or much care whether he 
would get the other two up or not. 
Most of the materials had blown 
away during the last dry period and 
he doubted very much that he 
would replace them. The two avail- 
able walls were cornered against 
the prevailing winds. The roof was 
still in good shape, allowing him a 
sufficient space free of leaks to ac- 
commodate his cooking and the 
mat which he called a bed. 

He picked up a gourd container 
from the rough bench in the center 
of the room and took a swallow of 
the burning liquid. From the front 
of the hut he looked out over the 
rain swept terrain at the circle of 
huts. Diametrically across from him 
he could see Bolinger, the little 
biologist, moving energetically 
about. Bolinger was the only one 
who had retained any semblance of 
scientific interest. He puttered con- 
tinually over his collection, which 
had grown enormously over the 
eight year period. 

When they got back, Bolinger at 
least would have some accomplish- 
ment to view with pride. The rest 
of them — ? 

Carnahan laughed sharply and 
took another big swallow from the 
gourd, feeling the fresh surge of hot 
liquor already crossing the portals 
of his brain, bringing its false sense 
of wisdom and clarity. He knew it 



was false, but it was the only source 
of wisdom he had left, he told him- 
self. 

He staggered back to the bed 
with the gourd. He caught a 
glimpse of his image in the small 
steel mirror on the little table at the 
end of the bed. Pausing to stare, 
he stroked the thick mat of beard 
and ran his fingers through the 
mane of hair that had been very 
black when he came, and was now 
a dirty silver grey. 

He hadn’t looked at himself for 
a long time, but now he had to. He 
had to know what they would see 
when the ships of Earth came to 
pick up the personnel of the Base 
and leave another crew. The image 
made him sick. 

At the beginning of this final sea- 
son of the rains, all his life before 
coming to Serrengia seemed like a 
dream that had never been real. 
Now it was coming back, as if he 
were measuring the final distance 
of a circle and approaching once 
again his starting point. He kept 
remembering more and more. 
Watching his image in the mirror, 
he remembered what General Win- 
throp had said on the day of their 
departure. “The pick of Earth’s 
finest,” the General said. “We have 
combed the Earth and you are the 
men we have chosen to represent 
Mankind in the far reaches of the 
Universe. Remember that wherever 
you go, there goes the honor of 
Mankind. Do not, above all, betray 
that honor.” 

Carnahan clenched his teeth in 
bitterness. He wished old fatty 
Winthrop had come with them. 
Savagely he upended the gourd 
and flung it across the room. It 




THE COLONISTS 

meant a trip to Bailey’s hut to get it 
replenished. Bailey had been the 
Chief Physicist. Now he was the 
official distiller, and the rotgut he 
produced was the only thing that 
made existence bearable. 

The Captain stared again at his 
own image. “Captain Louis Carna- 
han,” he murmured aloud. “The 
pick of Earth’s finest — !” He 
smashed a fist at the little metal 
mirror and sent it flying across the 
room. The table crashed over, one 
feeble leg twisting brokenly. Then 
Carnahan hunched over with his 
face buried against the bed. His 
fists beat against it while his shoul- 
ders jerked in familiar, drunken 
sobs. 

After it was over he raised up, 
sitting on the edge of the bed. His 
mind burned with devastating 
clarity. It seemed for once he could 
remember everything that had ever 
happened to him. He remembered 
it all. He remembered his child- 
hood under the bright, pleasant sky 
of Earth. He remembered his am- 
bition to be a soldier, which meant 
spaceman, even then. He remem- 
bered his first flight, a simple train- 
ing tour of the Moon installations. 
It convinced him that never again 
could he consider himself an Earth- 
man in the sense of one who dwells 
upon the Earth. His realm was the 
sky and the stars. Not even the 
short period when he had allowed 
himself to be in love had changed 
his convictions. He had sacrificed 
everything his career demanded. 

Where had it gone wrong? How 
could he have allowed himself to 
forget? For years he had forgotten, 
he realized in horror. He had for- 
gotten that Earth existed. He had 



7 

forgotten how he came to be here, 
and why. And all that he was 
meant to accomplish had gone un- 
done. For years the scientific work 
of the great base expedition had 
been ignored. Only the little biolo- 
gist across the way, pecking at his 
tasks season after season, had ac- 
complished anything. 

And now the ships were coming 
to demand an accounting. 

He groaned aloud as the vision 
became more terrible. He thought 
of that day when they had arrived 
at the inhospitable and uninhabited 
world of Serrengia. He could close 
his eyes and see it again — the four 
tall ships standing on the plateau 
that was scarred by their landing. 
The men had been so proud of 
what they had done and would yet 
do. They could see nothing to de- 
feat them as they unloaded the 
mountains of equipment and sup- 
plies. 

Now that same equipment lay 
oozing in the muck of leafy de- 
composition, corroded and useless 
like the men themselves. And in the 
dry seasons it had been alternately 
buried and blasted by the sands and 
the winds. 

He remembered exactly the day 
and the hour when they had 
cracked beyond all recovery. With 
an iron hand he had held them for 
three years. Weekly he demanded 
an appearance in full dress uni- 
form, and hard discipline in all 
their relationships was the rule. 
Then one day he let the dress re- 
view go. They had come in from a 
long trek through a jungle that was 
renewing itself after a dry season. 
Too exhausted in body and spirit, 
and filled with an increasing sense

of futility, he abandoned for the 
moment the formalities he had 
held to. 

After that it was easy. They fell 
apart all around him. He tried to 
hold them, settling quarrels that 
verged on mutiny. Then in the 
sixth month of the fourth year he 
had to kill with his own hands the 
first of his crazed and rebellious 
crew. This scientific work disin- 
tegrated and was abandoned. He 
remembered he had locked up all 
their notes and observations and 
charts, but where he had hidden 
the metal chest was one of the few 
things he seemed unable to recall. 

The more violent of the expedi- 
tion killed each other off, or wan- 
dered into the jungle or desert and 
never came back. On the even 
dozen who were left there had set- 
tled a kind of monastic hermitage. 
Each man kept to himself, aware 
that a hairbreadth trespass against 
his neighbor would mean quick 
challenge to the death. Yet they 
clung to membership in this degen- 
erate community as if it repre- 
sented their last claim to human- 
ness. 

This is what they would see Car- 
nahan, thought. They would see 
his personal failure* It was his, 
there was no question of that. If he 
had been strong he could have held 
the expedition together. He could 
have maintained the base in all the 
strength and honor of military 
tradition that had been entrusted 
to him. He hadn’t been strong 
enough. 

The ships would come. The four 
of them. They might come tomor- 
row or even today. A panic crept 
through him. The ships could land 



at any time now, and their men 
would come marching out to greet 
him in his failure and cowardice 
and his dishonor. It must not hap- 
pen. Old fatty Winthrop had said 
one thing that made sense: 
“ — there goes the honor of Man- 
kind. Do not, above all, betray that 
honor.” 

Fatty was right. The only thing 
he had left was honor, and in only 
one way could he retain it. 

With the fiery clarity burning in 
his brain he struggled from where 
he lay and picked up the metallic 
mirror and hung it from the post 
near the bed. He turned up the 
broken table against the wall. 
Then, with the air of one who has 
not been on the premises for a long 
time he began searching through 
the long unused chests stacked in 
the corner. The contents were for 
the most part in a state of decay, 
but he found his straight edged 
razor in the oiled pouch where he 
had last placed it. 

There should have been shaving 
detergent, but he couldn’t find it. 
He contented himself with prepar- 
ing hot water, then slowly and 
painfully hacked the thick beard 
away and scraped his face clean. 
He found a comb and raked it 
through his tangled mat of hair, 
arranging it in some vague resem- 
blance to the cut he used to wear. 

From the chests he drew forth 
the dress uniform he had put away 
so long ago. Fortunately, it had 
been in the center, surrounded by 
other articles so that it was among 
the best preserved of his possessions. 
He donned it in place of the rags 
he wore. The shoes were almost 
completely hard from lack of care,

but he put them on anyway and 
brushed the toes with a scrap of 
cloth. 

From underneath his bed he took 
his one possession which he had 
kept in meticulous repair, his serv- 
ice pistol. Then he stood up, but- 
toning and smoothing his coat, and 
smiled at himself in the little mir- 
ror. But his gaze shifted at once 
to something an infinity away. 

“ ‘Do not, above all, betray that 
honor.’ At least you gave us one 
good piece of advice, fatty,” he 
said. 

Carefully, he raised the pistol to 
his head. 



ULL NUMBER FOUR was 
erect and self-supporting. Its 
shell enclosure was complete ex- 
cept for necessary installation open- 
ings. And in Number One the in- 
stallations were complete and the 
ship’s first test flight was scheduled 
for tomorrow morning. 

John Ashby looked from the 
third story window of his office to- 
ward the distant assembly yards on 
the other side of the field. The four 
hulls stood like golden flames in 
the afternoon sunlight. Ashby felt 
defeated by the speed with which 
the ships were being completed. It 
was almost as if the engineers had 
a special animosity toward him, 
which they expressed in their un- 
reasonable speed of construction. 
This was nonsense, of course. They 
had a job to do and were proud if 
they could cut time from their 
schedule. 

But there was no cutting time 
from his schedule, and without the 
completion of his work the ships 



would not fly. He had to find men 
capable of taking them on their 
fantastic journeys. To date, he had 
failed. 

He glanced down at the black 
car with government markings, 
which had driven in front of the 
building a few moments before, 
and then he heard Miss Haslam, 
his secretary, on the interphone. 
“The Colonization Commission, 
Dr. Ashby.” 

He turned from the window. 
“Have them come in at once,” he 
said. 

He strode to the door and shook 
hands with each of the men. Only 
four of them had come: Mr. Mer- 
ton, Chairman; General Winthrop; 
Dr. Cowper; and Dr. Boxman. 

“Please have seats over here by 
the window,” Ashby suggested. 

They accepted and General 
Winthrop stood a moment looking 
out. “A beautiful sight, aren’t they, 
Ashby?” he said. “They get more 
beautiful every day. You ought to 
get over more often. Collins says 
you haven’t been around the place 
for weeks, and Number One is go- 
ing up tomorrow.” 

“We’ve had too much to occupy 
us here.” 

“My men are ready,” said the 
General pointedly. “We could sup- 
ply a dozen crews to take those 
ships to Serrengia and back, and 
man the base there.” 

Ashby turned away, ignoring the 
General’s comment. He took a 
chair at the small conference table 
where the three Commissioners had 
seated themselves. Winthrop fol- 
lowed, settling in his chair with a 
smile, as if he had scored a major 
point.

RAYMOND F. JONES 



“Number One is ready,” said 
Merton, “and still you have failed 
to offer us a single man, Dr. Ashby. 
The Commission feels that the time 
is very near when definite action 
will have to be taken. We have your 
reports, but we wanted a personal 
word with you to see if we couldn’t 
come to some understanding as to 
what we can expect.” 

“I will send you the men when I 
find out what kind of man we 
need,” said Ashby. “Until then 
there had better be no thought of 
releasing the colonization fleet. I 
will not be responsible for any but 
the right answers to this problem.” 

“We are getting to the point,” 
said Boxman, “where we feel 
forced to consider the recommen- 
dations of General Winthrop. 
Frankly, we have never been able 
to fully understand your objec- 
tions.” 

“There’ll never be a time when I 
cannot supply all the men needed 
to establish this base,” said Win- 
throp. “We spend unlimited funds 
and years of time training person- 
nel for posts of this kind, yet you 
insist on looking for unprepared 
amateurs. It makes no sense what- 
ever, and only because you have 
been given complete charge of the 
personnel program have you been 
able to force your views on the 
Commission. But no one under- 
stands you. In view of your con- 
tinued failure, the Commission is 
going to be forced to make its own 
choice.” 

“My resignation may be had at 
any time,” said Ashby. 

“No, no, Dr. Ashby.” Merton 
held up his hand. “The General is 
perhaps too impulsive in his dis- 



appointment that you have failed 
us so far, but we do not ask for 
your resignation. We do ask if there 
is not some way in which you might 
see fit to use the General’s men in 
manning the base.” 

“The whole answer lies in the 
erroneous term you persist in ap- 
plying to this project,” said Ashby. 
“It is not a base, and never will 
be. We propose to set up a colony. 
It makes an enormous difference 
with respect to the kind of men 
required. We’ve been over this be- 
fore — ” 

“But not enough,” snapped Win- 
throp. “We’ll continue to go over 
it until you understand you can’t 
waste those ships on a bunch of 
half-baked idealists inspired by 
some noble nonsense about carry- 
ing on the torch of human civiliza- 
tion beyond the stars. We’re put- 
ting up a base, to gather scientific 
data and establish rights of occu- 
pancy.” 

“I don’t think I agree with your 
description of my proposed party 
of colonists,” said Ashby mildly. 

“That’s what they’ll be! Were 
colonists ever anything but psalm 
singing rebels or cutthroats trying 
to escape hanging? You’re not go- 
ing to establish a cultural and scien- 
tific base with such people.” 

“No, you’re quite right. That’s 
not the kind.” 

“What is it you’re looking for?” 
said Merton irritably. “What kind 
of men do you want, if you can’t 
find them among the best and the 
worst humanity offers.” 

“Your terms are hardly accu- 
rate,” said Ashby. “You fail to rec- 
ognize the fact that we have never 
known what kind of man it takes 




THE COLONISTS 



11 



to colonize. You ignore the fact 
that we have never yet successfully 
colonized the planets of our own 
Solar System. Bases, yes — but all 
our colonies have failed to date. 5 ’ 
“What better evidence could you 
ask for in support of my argu- 
ment?” demanded Winthrop. 
“We’ve proved bases are practical, 
and that colonies are not.” 

“No matter how far away or how 
long the periods of rotation, a man 
assigned to a base expects to re- 
turn home. Night or day, in the 
performance of any duty, there is 
in his mind as a working back- 
ground the recognition that at some 
future time he can go home. His 
base is never his home.” 

“Precisely. That is what makes 
the base successful.” 

Ashby shook his head. “No base 
is ever successful from the stand- 
point of permanent extension of a 
civilization. By its very nature it 
is transitory, impermanent. That is 
not what we want now.” 

“We have the concept of perma- 
nent bases in military thinking,” 
said Winthrop. “You can’t general- 
ize in that fashion.” 

“Name for me a single military 
or expeditionary base that con- 
tinued its permanency over any ex- 
tended period of history.” 

“Well — now — ” 

“The concept is invalid,” said 
Ashby. “Extensions of humanity 
from one area to another on a per- 
manent basis are made by colonists. 
Men who do not expect to rotate, 
but come to live and establish 
homes. This is what we want on 
Serrengia. Humanity is preparing 
to make an extension of itself in 
the Universe. 



“But more than this, there are 
limitations of time and distance in 
the establishment of bases, which 
cannot be overcome by any amount 
of training of personnel. Cycles of 
rotation and distances from home 
can be lengthened beyond the ca- 
pacity of men to endure. It is only 
when they go out with no expecta- 
tion of return that time and dis- 
tance cease to control them.” 

“We do not know of any such 
limitations,” said Winthrop. “They 
have not been met here in the Solar 
System.” 

“We know them,” said Ashby. 
“The thing we have not found and 
which we must discover before 
those ships depart is the quality 
that makes it possible for a man to 
ignore time and distance and his 
homeland. We know a good deal 
about the successful colonists of 
Earth’s history. We know that in- 
variably they were of some minority 
group which felt itself persecuted 
or limited by conditions surround- 
ing it, or else they were fleeing the 
results of some crime.” 

“If that is what you are looking 
for, it is no wonder you have 
failed,” said Dr. Cowper. “We have 
no such minority groups in our so- 
ciety.” 

“Very true,” Ashby replied. “But 
it is not the condition of fleeing or 
being persecuted that generates the 
qualities of a perfect colonist by 
any means! We have examples 
enough of adequately persecuted 
groups who failed as colonists. But 
there is some quality, which seems 
to appear, if at all, only in some of 
those who have courage enough to 
flee their oppression or limiting 
conditions. This quality makes

them successful in their coloniza- 
tion. 

“We are looking first, therefore, 
for individuals who would have the 
courage to resist severe limitations 
to the extent of flight, if such lim- 
itations existed. And among these 
we hope to find the essence of that 
which makes it possible for a man 
to cut all ties with his homeland.’ 5 

“So you are making your search,” 
said Merton, “among the poten- 
tially rebellious and criminal?” 

Ashby nodded. “We have con- 
fined our study to these individuals 
as a result of strict historical prece- 
dent so that we might narrow the 
search as much as possible. You 
must understand, however, that to 
choose merely the rebellious and 
staff our ships with these would be 
foolhardy. It would be a ridiculous 
shotgun technique. Some of them 
would succeed, but we would never 
know which it would be. We might 
send twenty or a thousand ships out 
and establish one successful colony. 

“We have to do much better 
than that. Our consumption of fa- 
cilities on this project is so great 
that we have to know, within a neg- 
ligible margin of error, that when 
these groups are visited in eight or 
fifty years from now we will find a 
community of cooperative, progres- 
sive human beings. We cannot be 
satisfied with less!” 

“I’m afraid the majority of sen- 
timent in the Commission is not in 
agreement with you,” said Mr. 
Merton. “To oppose General Win- 
throp’s trained crews with selected 
cutthroats and traitors may have 
historical precedent, but it scarce- 
ly seems the optimum proceedure 
in this case! 



“We are willing to be shown 
proof of your thesis, Dr. Ashby, but 
we have certain realities of which 
we are sure. If we can do no better, 
we shall take the best available to 
us at the time the ships are ready. 
If you cannot supply us with 
proven crews and colonists by then 
we shall be forced to accept Gen- 
eral Winthrop’s recommendations 
and choose personnel whose reac- 
tions are at least known and pre- 
dictable to a high degree. I’m sorry, 
but surely you can understand our 
position in this matter.” 

For a long time Ashby was si- 
lent, looking from one to the other 
of the faces about the table. Then 
he spoke in a low voice, as if hav- 
ing reached the extremity of his re- 
sources. “Yes — the reactions of 
Winthrop’s men are indeed known. 
I suggest that you come with me 
and I will show you what those re- 
actions are.” 

He stood up and the others fol- 
lowed with inquiring expressions 
on their faces. Winthrop made a 
short, jerky motion of his head, as 
if he detected a hidden sting in 
Ashby’s words. “What do you mean 
by that?” he demanded. 

“You don’t suppose that our ex- 
aminations would neglect the men 
on whom you have spent so much 
time and effort in training?” 

The General flushed with rage. 
“If you’ve tampered with any of 
my men — ! You had no right — !” 
The other Commission members 
were smiling in faint amusement 
at the General’s discomfiture. 

“I should think it would be to 
your advantage to check the results 
of your training,” said Mr. Merton. 
“There is only one possible 




THE COLONISTS 



13 



check!” exclaimed General Win- 
throp. “Put these men on a base 
for a period of eight years and at 
a distance of forty seven light years 
from home and see what they will 
do. That is the only way you can 
check on them.” 

“And if you know anything 
about our methods of testing, you 
will understand that this, in effect, 
is what we have done. Your best 
man is about to be released from 
the test pit. He can’t have more 
than an hour to go.” 

“Who have you got in your 
guinea pig pen?” the General de- 
manded. “If you’ve ruined him — ” 
“Captain Louis Carnahan,” said 
Ashby. “Shall we go down, gentle- 
men?” 

I T HAD been a grisly business, 
watching the final minutes of 
Carnahan’s disintegration. General 
Winthrop’s face was almost pur- 
ple when he saw the test pit in 
which Carnahan was being exam- 
ined. He tried to tear out the ob- 
servation lens with his bare hands 
as he saw the Captain lift the 
loaded pistol to his head in the mo- 
ment before the safety beam cut in. 

And now Ashby kept hearing 
Winthrop’s furious, scathing voice: 
“You have destroyed one of the 
best men the Service has ever pro- 
duced! I’ll have your hide for this, 
Ashby, if it’s the last act of my 
life.” 

Merton and the others had been 
shocked also by the violence and 
degradation of what they saw, but 
whether he had made his point or 
not, Ashby didn’t know. Carnahan, 
of course, would be returned to the 



Service within twenty four hours, 
all adverse effects of the test com- 
pletely removed. He would be 
aware that he had taken it and had 
not passed, but there would be no 
trace of the bitter emotions gen- 
erated during those days of exami- 
nation. 

Ashby looked out again at the 
four hulls now turning from gold 
to red as the sun dropped lower in 
the sky. He had not asked Merton 
if the ultimatum was going to stick. 
He wondered how they could insist 
on it after what they had seen, but 
he didn’t know. 

Impatiently, he turned from the 
window as Miss Haslam’s voice 
came on the intercom once more. 
“Dr. Ashby, Mr. Jorden is still 
waiting to see you.” 

Jorden. He had forgotten. The 
man had been waiting during his 
conference with the Commission- 
ers. Jorden was the one who had 
been rejected for examination two 
weeks ago and insisted he had a 
right to be examined for coloniza- 
tion factors. He had been trying to 
get in ever since. He might as well 
get rid of the man once and for all, 
Ashby decided reluctantly. 

“Show him in,” he said. 

Mark Jorden was a tall, blond 
man in his late twenties. Shaking 
hands with him, Ashby felt thick, 
strong fingers and glimpsed a mas- 
sive wrist at the edge of the coat 
sleeve. Jorden’s face was a pleasant 
Scandinavian pink, matched by 
blue eyes that looked intently into 
Ashby’s face. 

They sat at the desk. “You want 
to be a colonist,” said Ashby. “You 
say you want to settle forty seven 
light years from Earth for the rest 




14 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



of your life. And our preliminary 
psycho tests indicate you have 
scarcely a vestige of the basic quali- 
ties required. Why do you insist on 
the full examination?” 

Jorden smiled and shook his 
head honestly. “I don’t know ex- 
actly. It seems like something I’d 
enjoy doing. Maybe it’s in my peo- 
ple — they liked to move around 
and see new places. They were 
seamen in the days when there 
weren’t any charts to sail by.” 
“It’s certain that this is a situa- 
tion without charts to sail by,” said 
Ashby, “but I hardly think the 
word ‘enjoy’ is applicable. Have 
you thought at all of what existence 
means at that distance from Earth, 
with no communication whatever 
except a ship every eight years or 
so? Qualifications just a trifle short 
of insanity are required for a ven- 
ture of that kind.” 

“I’m sure you don’t mean that. 
Dr. Ashby,” said Jorden reprov- 
ingly. 

“Perhaps not,” said Ashby. His 
visitor’s calm assurance irritated 
him, as if he were the one who 
knew what a colonist ought to be. 
“I see by your application you’re 
an electrical engineer.” 

Jorden nodded. “Yes. My com- 
pany has just offered me the head 
of the department, but I had to 
explain I was putting in an applica- 
tion for colonist. They think I’m 
crazy, of course.” 

“Does taking the examination 
mean giving up your promotion?” 
“I’m not sure. But I rather think 
they will pass me up and give it to 
one of the other men.” 

“You want to go badly enough to 
risk giving up that chance in order 



to take an examination which will 
unquestionably show you have no 
qualifications whatever to be a 
colonist?” 

“I think I’m qualified,” said Jor- 
den. “I insist on being given the 
chance. I believe I have the right 
to it.” 

Ashby tried to restrain his irrita- 
tion. What Jorden said was perhaps 
true. No one had ever raised the 
point before. Those previously re- 
jected by the preliminary tests had 
withdrawn in good grace. It 
seemed senseless to waste the time 
of a test pit and its large crew on 
an obviously hopeless applicant. On 
the other hand, he couldn’t afford 
to have Jorden stirring up trouble 
with the Colonization Commission 
at this critical time — and he could 
guess that was exactly what Jor- 
den’ s next move would be if he 
were turned down again. 

“Our machines will find out 
everything about you later,” said 
Ashby, “but I’d like you to tell me 
about yourself so that I may feel 
personally acquainted with you.” 

Jorden shrugged. “There’s not 
much to tell. I had the usual school- 
ing, which wasn’t anything impres- 
sive. I had my three year hitch in 
the Service, and I suppose that’s 
where I began to feel there was 
something available in life which I 
had never anticipated. I suppose it 
sounds very silly to you, but when I 
first put a foot on the Moon I felt 
like crying. I picked up a handful 
of pumice and let it sift through my 
fingers. I looked out toward Mars 
and felt as if I could go anywhere, 
that I ought to go everywhere. 

“The medicos told me later that 
it was a crazy sort of feeling that 




THE COLONISTS 



15 



everyone gets his first time out, but 
I didn’t believe them. I didn’t be- 
lieve it was quite the same with 
anyone else. When I got out to 
Mars finally, and during my one 
tour on Pluto, it seemed to get 
worse instead of decreasing as they 
told me it would. When I got out 
I took a job in my profession, and 
I’ve been satisfied, but I’ve never 
been able to get rid of the feeling 
there’s something I’m missing, 
something I ought to be doing. It’s 
connected with everything out 
there.” He lifted a broad hand and 
gestured to the horizon beyond the 
windows. 

“Perhaps your career should 
have been in the Service,” sug- 
gested Ashby. 

“No. That was good enough 
while it lasted, but they didn’t have 
anything I wanted permanently. 
When I heard about the proposed 
colonization on Serrengia that 
seemed to be it.” 

“Your application indicates you 
are not married.” 

“That’s right,” said Jorden. “I 
have no ties to hold me hack.” 
“You understand, of course, that 
as a colonist you will be expected 
to marry, either before leaving or 
soon after arrival. Colonial life is 
family life.” 

“I hadn’t thought much about 
that, but it can’t be too bad, I sup- 
pose. I presume my choice would 
be quite severely limited to a fel- 
low colonist?” 

“Correct.” 

“There is a story about my third 
or fourth grandfather who was 
given a girl to marry the night be- 
fore he sailed from his homeland 
to settle in a new country. They 



had seventeen children and were 
said to be extraordinarily happy. 
My family still owns the homestead 
they cleared. I was bom there.” 

“It can be done, but it doesn’t 
conform closely with our currently 
accepted social mores,” said Ashby 
hopefully. 

“I’m sure that won’t stand in my 
way. If there’s a woman who’s will- 
ing to take a chance, I certainly 
will be.” 

“There’s one more thing we have 
to know,” said Ashby. “What are 
you running away from? Who or 
what are your enemies?” 

Jorden laughed uncertainly. “I’m 
sorry, but I’m not running away 
from anything. As far as I know I 
have no enemies.” 

“All colonists are running from 
something,” said Ashby. “Other- 
wise they would stay where they 
are.” 

Jorden regarded him a moment 
in silence, then smiled slowly. “I 
think you are going to have occa- 
sion to revise that thesis,” he said. 

“A great deal of history would 
also have to be revised if we did,” 
said Ashby. “At any rate, let’s go 
down to the test pits. I’ll show you 
what’s in store for you there, and 
you can further decide if you insist 
on going through with it.” 

T HE LABORATORIES of the 
Institute of Social Science were 
spread over a forty acre area, con- 
sisting mostly of the test pits where 
experimental examination of pro- 
posed colonists was being con- 
ducted. Ashby led his visitor to the 
ground floor where they took a 
pair of the electric cycles used for 




16 



transportation along the vast cor- 
ridors of the laboratory. 

A quarter of a mile away they 
stopped and entered a glassed-in 
control room fitted with a number 
of desks and extensive banks of 
electronic equipment. 

“This almost looks like a good 
sized computer setup / 5 said Jorden 
admiringly. 

“We use computers extensively, 
but this equipment is merely the 
recording and control apparatus 
for the synthetic environment es- 
tablished in the test pit. Please step 
this way . 55 

The control room was empty 
now, but during a test it was occu- 
pied by a dozen technicians. It was 
a highly unorthodox procedure to 
show a prospective colonist the test 
pit setup before examination, but 
Ashby still had hopes of shunting 
Jorden aside without wasting the 
facilities on a useless test. 

They moved to an observation 
post and Ashby directed Jorden’s 
attention to the observation lenses. 
“We cleaned out here this after- 
noon , 55 he said. “A Captain of the 
Service last occupied the pit . 55 

Jorden looked up inquiringly. 
“Did he— ?” 

“No. He didn’t make it. Tomor- 
row morning you will be given a 
preconditioning which will set up 
the basic situation that you have 
traveled to Serrengia and are now 
established there in the colony. We 
will begin the test at a period of 
some length after establishment 
there, when difficulties begin to pile 
up. Other members of the party 
will be laboratory staff people who 
will provide specific, guiding stim- 



RAYMOND F. JONES 

uli to determine your reaction to 
them . 55 

“Are they there constantly, night 
and day?” 

“No. When you are asleep their 
day’s work is over and they go 
home . 55 

“What if I wake up and find the 
whole setup is a phony?” 

“You won’t. We have control 
beams constantly focussed upon the 
persons being tested. These are 
used to keep him asleep when de- 
sirable, and to control him to the 
extent of preventing him doing 
physical harm to himself or others.” 

“Is that necessary?” said Jorden 
dubiously. “Why should anyone 
wish to do harm?” 

“The Captain, whom we re- 
leased today, was pushed to the 
point of suicide,” said Ashby. “We 
find it quite necessary to assure our- 
selves of adequate control at all 
times.” 

“How can you set up the illu- 
sion of distance and a whole new 
world in such a comparatively 
small area?” 

“It is illusion, a great deal of it. 
Some is induced along with the 
initial preconditioning, other fea- 
tures are done mechanically, but 
when you are there you will have 
no doubt whatever that you are a 
colonist on the planet Serrengia. 
You will act accordingly, and re- 
spond to the stimuli exactly as if 
you had been transported to the 
actual planet. In this way, we are 
sure of finding colonists who will 
not blow up when they face the 
real situation.” 

“How many have you found so 
far?” 

“None.” 




THE COLONISTS 



17 



Jorden was shaken for a mo- 
ment, but he smiled then and said, 
“You have found one. Put my 
name down on the books.” 

“We’ll see,” said Ashby grimly. 
“Your colony will be in the limited 
belt of the planet’s northern hemi- 
sphere where considerable agricul- 
ture is possible. You’ll be in the 
midst of a group trying to beat a 
living from a world which is neither 
excessively hostile nor conducive to 
indolence. Some of the people will 
be bitter and wish they had never 
come. They will break up in 
groups and fight each other. They 
will challenge every reason you 
have for your own coming. You 
will face your own personal im- 
poverishment, the death of your 
child—” 

“Child?” said Jorden. 

“Yes. You will be provided with 
a wife and three children. One of 
these will die, and you will react as 
if it were your own flesh. Your wife 
will oppose your staying, and de- 
mand a return to Earth. We will 
throw at you every force available 
to tear down your determination to 
build a colony. We shall test in ev- 
ery possible way the validity of 
your decision to go. Do you still 
wish to go through with it?” 

Jorden’s grin was somewhat 
fainter. He took a deep breath as 
he nodded slowly. “Yes, I’ll go 
through with it. I think it’s what I 
want.” 

When Ashby finally returned 
alone to the office, Miss Haslam 
had gone home. He put in a call 
anyway for Dr. Bonnie Nathan. 
She usually remained somewhere 
in the laboratory until quite late, 



even when not assigned to a test. 

In a few minutes her voice came 
over the phone. “John? What can 
I do for you?” 

“I thought I could let you off for 
a few days,” said Ashby, “but we’ve 
got another one that’s come up 
rather suddenly.” He told her 
briefly about Mark Jorden. “It’s 
useless, but I don’t want him run- 
ning to the Commission right now, 
so we’ll put him through. You’ll be 
the wife. We’ll use Program Sixty 
Eight, except that we’ll accelerate 
it.” 

“Accelerate — !” 

“Yes. It won’t hurt him any. 
Whatever happens we can wipe up 
afterwards. This is simply a nuis- 
ance and I want it out of the way 
as quickly as possible. After that — 
perhaps I can give you those few 
days I promised you. O.K.?” 

“It’s all right with me,” said 
Bonnie. “But an accelerated Sixty 
Eight—” 

T HEY STOOD on a low hillock 
overlooking the ninety acres of 
bottom land salvaged from the 
creek grass. Mark Jorden shaded 
his eyes and squinted critically 
over the even stand of green shoots 
emerging from the bronzed soil. 
Germination had been good in 
spite of the poor planting time. 
The chance of getting a crop out 
was fair. If they didn’t they’d be 
eating shoe plastic in another few 
months. / 

The ten year old boy beside him 
clutched his hand and edged closer 
as if there were something threat- 
ening him from the broad fields. 
“Isn’t there any way at all for 




18 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



Earth to send us food,” he said, “if 
we don’t get a crop?” 

“We have to make believe Earth 
doesn’t exist, Roddy,” said Jorden. 
“We couldn’t even let them know 
we need help, we’re so far away.” 
He gripped the boy’s shoulders 
solidly in his big hands and drew 
him close. “We aren’t going to need 
any help from Earth. We’re going 
to make it on our own. After all, 
what would they do on Earth if 
they couldn’t make it? Where 
would they go for outside help?” 

“I know,” said the boy, “but 
there are so many of them they 
can’t fail. Here, there’s only the 
few of us.” 

Jorden patted his shoulder gent- 
ly again as they started moving to- 
ward the rough houses a half mile 
away. “That makes it all the easier 
for us,” he said. “We don’t have to 
worry about the ones who won’t 
cooperate. We can’t lose with the 
setup we’ve got.” 

It was harder for Roddy. He re- 
membered Earth, although he had 
been only four when they left. He 
still remembered the cities and the 
oceans and the forests he had 
known so briefly, and was cursed 
with the human nostalgia for a past 
that seemed more desirable than 
an unknown, fearful future. 

Of the other children, Alice had 
been a baby when they left, and 
Jerry had been born during the 
trip. They knew only Serrengia 
and loved its wild, uncompromising 
rigor. They spent their abandoned 
wildness of childhood in the near- 
by hills and forests. But with Roddy 
it was different. Childhood seemed 
to have slipped by him. He was 
moody, and moved carefully in 



constant fear of this world he 
would never willingly call home. 
Jorden’ s heart ached with longing 
to instill some kind of joy into him. 

“That looks like Mr. Tibbets,” 
said Roddy suddenly, his eyes on 
the new log house. 

“I believe you’re right,” said 
Jorden. “It looks like Roberts and 
Adamson with him. Quite a dele- 
gation. I wonder what they want.” 

The colony consisted of about a 
hundred families, each averaging 
five members. Originally they had 
settled on a broad plateau at some 
distance from the river. It was a 
good location overlooking hun- 
dreds of miles of desert and forest 
land. Its soil was fertile and the 
river water was lifted easily 
through the abundant power of 
the community atomic energy 
plant which had been brought from 
Earth. 

Three months ago, however, the 
power plant had been destroyed in 
a disasterous explosion that killed 
almost a score of the colonists. 
Crops for their next season’s food 
supply were half matured and could 
not be saved by any means avail- 
able. 

The community was broken into 
a number of smaller groups. Three 
of these, composed of fifteen fam- 
ilies each, moved to the low lands 
along the river bank and cleared 
acreage for new crops in a desper- 
ate hope of getting a harvest be- 
fore the season ended. They had 
not yet learned enough of the cycle 
of weather in this area to predict it 
with much accuracy. 

Mark Jorden was in charge of 
one of the farms and the elected 




THE COLONISTS 



19 



leader of the village in which he 
lived. 

Tibbets was an elderly man from 
the same village. In his middle six- 
ties, he presented a puzzle to Jor- 
den as to why he had been permit- 
ted to come. Roberts and Adamson 
were from the settlements farther 
down the river. 

Jorden felt certain of the reason 
for their visit. He didn’t want to 
hear what they had to say, but he 
knew he might as well get it over 
with. 

They hailed him from the nar- 
row wooden porch. Jorden came 
up the steps and shook hands with 
each. “Won’t you come in? I’m 
sure Bonnie can find something 
cool to drink.” 

Tibbets wiped his thin, wrinkled 
brow. “She already has. That girl 
of yours doesn’t waste any time be- 
ing told what to do. It’s too bad 
some of the others can’t pitch in 
the way Bonnie does.” 

Jorden accepted the praise with- 
out comment, wondering if no one 
else at all were aware of the hot, 
violent protests she sometimes 
poured out against him because of 
the colony. 

“Come in anyway,” Jorden said. 
“I have to go back to the watering 
in a little while, but you can take it 
easy till then.” He led the way into 
the log house. 

Their homes on the plateau had 
been decent ones. With adequate 
power they had made lumber and 
cement, and within a year of their 
landing had built a town of fine 
homes. Among those who had been 
forced to abandon them, no one 
was more bitter than Bonnie. 
“You’re no farmer,” she said. 



“Why can’t those who are be the 
ones to move?” 

Now, when he came into the 
kitchen, she was tired, but she tried 
to smile as always at her pleasure 
in seeing him again. He couldn’t 
imagine what it would be like not 
having her to welcome him from 
the fields. 

“I’ll get something cool for you 
and Roddy,” she said. “Would 
you gentlemen like another drink?” 
When they were settled in the 
front room Tibbets spoke. “You 
know why we’ve come, Mark. The 
election is only a couple of months 
away. We can’t have Boggs in for 
another term of governor. You’ve 
got to say you’ll run against him.” 
“As I told you last time, Boggs 
may be a poor excuse for the job, 
but I’d be worse. He’s at least an 
administrator. I’m only an engineer 
— and more recently a farmer.” 
“We’ve got something new, 
now,” said Tibbets, his eyes sud- 
denly cold and meaningful. 

“The talk about his deliberately 
blowing up the power plant? Talk 
of that kind could blow up the 
whole colony as well. Boggs may 
have his faults but he’s not insane.” 
“We’ve got proof now,” said 
Tibbets. “It’s true. Adamson’s got 
the evidence. He got one of the en- 
gineers who escaped the blast to 
talk. It’s one of them who were 
supposed to have been killed. He’s 
so scared of Boggs he’s still hiding 
out. But he’s got the proof and 
those who are helping him know 
it’s true.” 

“Tibbet’s is right,” said Adam- 
son earnestly. “We /know it’s true. 
And something like that can’t stay 
hidden. It’s got to be brought out 




20 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



if we’re going to make the colony 
survive. You can’t just shut your 
eyes to it and say, ‘Good old Boggs 
would never do a thing like that.’ ” 

Jorden’s eyes were darker as he 
spoke in low tones now, hoping 
Roddy would not be listening in 
the kitchen. “Suppose it is true. 
Why would Boggs do such an in- 
sane thing?” 

“Because he’s an insane man,” 
said Tibbets. “That’s the obvious 
answer. He wants to destroy the 
colony and limit its growth. He 
was satisfied to come here and be 
elected governor and run the show. 
He saw it as means of becoming a 
two-bit dictator over a group of 
subservient colonists. It hasn’t 
turned out that way. He found a 
large percentage of engineers and 
scientists who would have none of 
his nonsense. 

“He saw the group becoming 
something bigger than himself. He 
had to cut it down to his own size. 
He’s willing to destroy what he 
can’t possess, but he believes that 
by reducing us to primitive status 
he can keep us in line. In either 
case the colony loses.” 

“If what you say is true — if it’s 
actually true,” Jorden said, his 
eyes suddenly far away,- “we’ve got 
to fight him — ” 

“Then we can count on you?” 

“Yes — you can count on me.” 

He stood in the doorway watch- 
ing the departure of the three men, 
but he was aware of Bonnie behind 
him. She rushed to him as he 
turned, and put her face against 
his chest. 

“Mark — you can’t do it! Boggs 
will kill you. This is no concern of 



ours. We don’t belong to Main- 
town any more. It’s their business 
up there. I’d go crazy if anything 
happened to you. You’ve got to 
think of the rest of us!” 

“I am thinking,” said Mark. He 
raised her chin so he could look 
into her eyes. “I’m thinking that 
we are going to live here the rest of 
our lives, and so are the children. 
If the story about Boggs is true, 
we’re all concerned. We wouldn’t 
be down here if the power plant 
hadn’t been destroyed. We’d be liv- 
ing in our good home in Main- 
town. Would you expect me to let 
Boggs get away with this without 
raising a hand to stop him?” 

“Yes — I would,” said Bonnie, 
“because there is nothing anyone 
can do. You know he has Main- 
town in the palm of his hand. He’s 
screened out every ruffian and 
soured colonist in the whole group 
and they’ll do anything he says. 
You can’t fight them all, Mark. I 
won’t let you.” 

“It won’t be me alone,” said 
Jorden. “If it develops into a fight 
the majority of the colony will be 
with us. Earth will be with us. 
Boggs will be facing the results of 
the whole two billion year struggle 
it took to make man what he now 



I N THE lounge off the lab cafe- 
teria, Ashby indulged in a late 
coffee knowing he wouldn’t sleep 
anyway. Across the table Bonnie 
ate sparingly of a belated supper. 

“The threat of having to fight 
Boggs didn’t give him much of a 
scare,” said Ashby thoughtfully. 
“It’ll take a lot more than a

bogey man like Boggs to scare 
Mark / 5 said Bonnie. “You’ve got 
yourself a bigger quantity of man 
than you bargained for.” 

“This might turn out to be more 
interesting than we thought. I wish 
there were more time to spend on 
him. But Merton called up again 
today to verify the ultimatum I told 
you about. We produce colonists by 
the time Hull Four is complete or 
they turn the personnel problem 
over to Winthrop — even after they 
saw Carnahan go to pieces before 
their eyes.” 

“Has it ever occurred to you,” 
said Bonnie slowly, “that we might 
just possibly be off on the wrong 
foot? How do you know that any 
of the colonists of Earth’s history 
could have stood up to the de- 
mands of Serrengia? I’m beginning 
to suspect that the Mayflower’s 
passenger list would have folded 
quite completely under these con- 
ditions. They had it comparatively 
easy. So did most other successful 
colonists.” 

“Yes—?” said Ashby. 

“Maybe they succeeded in spite 
of being rebels. If they could have 
come to the new lands without the 
pressure of flight, but in complete 
freedom of action, they might have 
made an even greater success.” 

“But why would they have come 
at all, then?” 

“I don’t know. There must be 
another motive capable of impel- 
ling them. In great feats of explora- 
tion, creation — other human ac- 
tions similar to colonization — ” 

“There are no other human ac- 
tions similar to colonization,” said 
Ashby. “Surely you realize we’re 
dealing with something unique 



here, Bonnie!” 

“I know — all I’m trying to say 
is there could be another valid mo- 
tive. I think Mark Jorden’s got it. 
There’s something different about 
this test, and I think you ought to 
look in on it yourself.” 

“What’s so different about him?” 

“He doesn’t act like the rest. He 
hasn’t any apparent reason for be- 
ing here.” 

Ashby looked at the girl closely. 
She was one of his top staff mem- 
bers and had been with him from 
the beginning. The incredible 
strain of working day after day in 
the test pits was showing its effects, 
he thought. 

“I shouldn’t have let you get 
started on this one,” he said. 
“You’re fagged out. Maybe it 
would be better to erase what we’ve 
done and start over, so that you can 
drop out.” 

She shook her head with a quick- 
ness that surprised him. “I want to 
finish it, and see how Mark turns 
out. I’m so used to working with 
the bitter, anti-social ones that it’s 
a relief to have someone who is 
halfway normal and gregarious. I 
want to be around when we find 
out why he’s here.” 

“Especially if he should go all 
the way to the end. But he 
won’t — ” 

Ashby was genuinely concerned 
about Bonnie’s condition when he 
looked in on her the next morning. 
The strain on her face was real be- 
yond any matter of make-up or act- 
ing. He wondered just why she 
should be giving in to it now. Bon- 
nie was well trained, as were all 
the staff members who worked in 




22

the test pits. The emotional con- 
flicts mocked up there were not al- 
lowed to penetrate very deeply into 
their personal experience, yet it 
looked now as if Bonnie had some- 
how lost control of the armor to 
protect against such invasion. She 
seemed to be living the circum- 
stances of the test program almost 
as intensely as Mark Jorden was 
doing. 

Such a condition couldn’t be 
permitted to continue, but he was 
baffled by it. Her physical and emo- 
tional check prior to the test had 
not shown her threshold to be this 
low. Evidently there was emotional 
dynamite buried somewhere in the 
situation they had manufactured. 

Through the observation lens of 
the test pit Ashby watched Jorden 
begin a tour of the villages, making 
a quiet investigation of the situa- 
tion, which he had all but ignored 
until it was forced to his attention. 
Jorden spent an hour with Adam- 
son, listening carefully to the 
atomic engineer’s story, and then 
was led to the hiding place of the 
engineer who claimed direct evi- 
dence that Boggs had instigated the 
explosion at the power plant. 

As Adamson left them, Ashby 
signaled him through the tiny but- 
ton buried in the skin behind his 
right ear. “This is Ashby,” he said. 
“How does it look? Do you think 
he’s going to tackle Boggs?” 

“No question of that.” Adam- 
son’s words came back, although he 
made no movement of his mouth or 
throat. “Jorden is one of these peo- 
ple with a lot of inertia. It takes a 
big push to get him moving, but 
when he really gets rolling there 
isn’t much that can stop him, 



either. You’re really going to have 
to put the pressure on to find his 
cracking point.” 

“I’m afraid we’re likely to find 
Bonnie’s first. There’s something 
about this that’s hitting her too 
hard. Do you know what it is?” 
“No,” said Adamson. “I thought 
I noticed it a little yesterday, too. 
Maybe we ought to check her out.” 
“She insists on completing the 
program. And I’d like to go all the 
way with Jorden. I’m becoming 
rather curious about him. Keep an 
eye on Bonnie and let me know 
what you think at the end of the 
shift.” 

“I’ll do that,” said Adamson. 

J ORDEN followed his guide for 
more than a mile beyond the 
last village on the bank of the river. 
There, in a willow hidden cave in 
the clay bank, he found James, the 
atomic engineer who was reported 
to know of Boggs’ attack on the 
power plant. 

“I told him you were coming,” 
said Adamson, “but I’m going to 
leave. You can make out better if 
you’re alone with him. He’s bitter, 
but he isn’t armed, and he’ll go 
along with you if you don’t push 
him too hard.” 

Jorden watched Adamson disap- 
pear along the bank in the direc- 
tion from which they had come. He 
had a feeling of utter ridiculous- 
ness. This wasn’t what they had 
come for! They had come to build 
an outpost of human beings, to es- 
tablish man’s claim in this sector 
of the Universe. And they were 
ending in a petty conflict worthy of 




THE COLONISTS 



23 



the politics of centuries before, back 
on Earth. 

His face took on a harder set as 
he approached the mouth of the 
cave and whistled the signal notes 
that Adamson had taught him. If 
the establishment of the colony de- 
manded this kind of fight then he 
was willing to enter the battle. He 
had not dedicated the remainder of 
his life to a goal only to abandon it 
to a petty tyrant like Boggs. 

A bearded face peered cautiously 
through parted willows and James’ 
voice spoke. “You’re Jorden? I sup- 
pose by now everybody in the vil- 
lages knows where I’m hiding out. 
I’m the world’s prize fool for letting 
this parade come past my place. 
Come in and I’ll tell you what I 
know. If you help get Boggs it will 
be worth anything it costs me.” 

Jorden followed the man 
through the screening willows to 
the mouth of the cave. There the 
two of them squatted on rocks op- 
posite each other. 

“I remember you now,” said 
James. “You set up the electric 
plant when we were assembling the 
pile, didn’t you? I thought we’d 
worked together.” 

Jorden nodded, hoping James 
would go on, remembering Adam- 
son’s caution not to push him too 
hard, but the engineer seemed to 
have nothing more to say. He 
rubbed a hand forcibly against his 
other arm and looked beyond the 
mouth of the cave to the slow mov- 
ing river. 

“This business concerning Boggs’ 
destruction of the plant — how did 
it start?” said Jorden finally. 

“How does anything of that kind 
start?” said James. “Boggs came to 



some of us and remarked in casual 
conversation what a shame it 
would be if the colony were to du- 
plicate all over again the mistakes 
that sooieties on Earth have made 
during the past thousands of years. 
A few of us were sympathetic with 
that thought — it would indeed be 
a shame. Some of the engineers 
thought that this was the perfect 
chance to set up a truly scientific 
society. They didn’t agree that 
Boggs was the ideal leader, but he 
was the leader and the obvious one 
to work through. They all became 
convinced that a rapid industrial- 
ization and a highly technological 
society built upon the old rusty 
foundations would be most difficult 
to overcome in building a society 
on truly adequate sociological prin- 
ciples. You can take it from there.” 
Yes, he could, Jorden thought. 
Anybody could take it from there. 
It was the oldest lie that men of 
power and position had ever con- 
cocted. Why had those particular 
colonists fallen for it? 

“What about you?” he asked 
James. “Were you sucked in by 
Boggs’ arguments?” 

The engineer nodded. “He took 
all of us. And all along he never 
intended that more than a couple 
would get out alive — by double 
crossing the others.” 

“Why?” said Jorden. 

“Why? I’ve thought a lot about 
that, living here in this mudhole. 
You get to thinking about things 
like that when you realize there’s 
no going back, that Boggs would 
kill me on sight for what I could 
tell — and that the other colonists 
would also, because of what I’ve 
done. Adamson says I can trust 




24 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



him. He says I can trust you. But I 
don’t trust anybody. I know that 
someday soon I’m going to get a 
bullet in the head from one of you. 
All I’m hoping is that some of you 
hate Boggs enough to get him first.” 
“Why did you come to Serrengia 
in the first place?” 

“To get away. Why did anyone 
come? You don’t give up every- 
thing you’ve got in order to go to 
some strange world and spend the 
rest of your life unless you’ve got a 
reason. Unless you hate what 
you’ve got so much you’re willing 
to try anything else. Unless you’re 
so terribly afraid of what could 
happen to you back there that 
you’re willing to face any kind of 
dangers out here. We all had our 
reasons. I’m not asking yours. It 
makes no difference to you what 
mine were. But they’re all alike. 
We came because we were so afraid 
or full of hate we couldn’t stay.” 
“How did you expect to build a 
new world out of hate and fear of 
the old one?” 

“Who worried about what we’d 
build here? All we wanted to do 
was get away. You can’t tell me 
you came for any other reason!” 

J ORDEN made no answer. He 
continued to stare in wonder at 
the atomic engineer. To what ex- 
tent were James’ words actually 
true? How completely was the col- 
ony riddled with unpredictable, 
purposeless characters like him? 

If they had fled Earth with a 
purpose to create something better 
than they left, there was a chance. 
But if James was right that most 
of them had come in blind flight 



with no goal at all then the Earth 
colony of Serrengia would be dead 
long before the ships came again. 

But Jorden did not believe this. 
He did not believe that any but a 
small fraction of the colonists had 
any feeling toward Earth except 
that of love. Most had come bo- 
cause they wanted to do this par- 
ticular thing with their lives. Noth- 
ing had driven or forced them to it. 

“Tell me what Boggs did, and 
what he persuaded you to do,” said 
Jorden. 

In detail, James told him how 
Boggs had gained influence with 
the technicians necessary to pre- 
pare the plant for destruction, how 
he had persuaded them that a new, 
idealistic social order demanded 
their obedience to this fantastic 
plan. Then, under the Governor’s 
direction, two of the men betrayed 
the rest. Only James, who was at a 
slight distance from his normal 
operating post that night, had es- 
caped with non-fatal injuries. 

“I know how you feel,” said 
James. “You’d like to stick a knife 
into me now. But until you succeed 
in disposing of Boggs, you need to 
be sure I’m alive. When that’s over 
you’ll send someone around to take 
care of the traitor, James. But you 
may be sure I won’t be here. I’ll get 
through your guards!” 

The man was half crazed, Jor- 
den thought, from infection and 
fever in half treated wounds, and 
probably from the effects of radia- 
tion itself. “We aren’t going to set 
up any guards,” he said. “We’re go- 
ing to send you medical care. Don’t 
try to get away down the river. I’ll

have some men who’ll take you 
where you’ll be safe and have 
care. 55 

Jorden left, on the hope that 
James would not attempt further 
flight until he was assured of Boggs’ 
defeat. But the colony could not 
quickly administer the kind of de- 
feat James wanted. They had to be 
orderly, even if it was a frontier 
community. There had to be a trial. 
There had to be evidence, and 
James had to be called to give it. 

He returned to the village and 
made arrangements with Adamson 
to get medical care for James. Dr. 
Babbit, one of the four physicians 
with the colony, was sufficiently 
out of sympathy with Boggs to be 
trusted. 

Then, with his family, he accom- 
panied Tibbets to Maintown. On 
the bulletin board outside the 
Council Hall he hung an an- 
nouncement of his candidacy for 
the governorship, which Tibbets 
had prepared for him. Tibbets 
made a little speech to the hand- 
full of people who gathered to read 
what was on the bulletin, but Jor- 
den declined to make any personal 
statement just now. He had enough 
to say when it came time to accuse 
Boggs of the crimes involved in de- 
struction of the power plant. 

But among those who squinted 
closely at Tibbets’ fine, black print- 
ing there came a look of mild awe. 
It had been generally assumed that 
Boggs would go unopposed for re- 
election. 

On the way back Tibbets’ car 
passed the length of Maintown and 
took them by the deserted house 
which Jorden had built in their 
first year on Serrengia. Bonnie gave 



it a covetous look, contrasting its 
spaciousness with the primitive 
cabin in which she now lived. 

, Tibbets caught her glance. “If it 
were not for Boggs you would still 
be living there,” he said. 

Bonnie made no answer. Both 
she and Roddy stared ahead, as if 
unable to bring their attention to 
bear upon the present, because of 
the fear incited by everything about 
them. Jorden was also silent, but 
his eyes wandered incessantly over 
the surrounding hills and distant 
farmlands. He hadn’t bargained for 
anything like this. He had expected 
to find himself in a society of co- 
operative and uniformly energetic 
human beings. He knew now, with- 
out any further persuasion, that 
this had been a vision strictly from 
an ivory tower. 

He should have anticipated that 
in a group like this there would be 
a sprinkling of small time thugs and 
dictators and generally shiftless in- 
dividuals who could not make a go 
of it in the society they had left. At 
home you could live and work with 
such without ever being more than 
vaguely aware of their eccentrici- 
ties. Here, their deviation from re- 
quired cooperation was enough to 
disrupt the whole community. 

He could understand the terror 
in Bonnie and Roddy. They had 
come only because of him, with no 
understanding of the colony’s pur- 
pose. The present turmoil under- 
lined their conviction that it had 
been pure folly to come. Somehow 
he’d have to show them. He’d have 
to make them understand there was 
a reason for being on Serrengia. 
But at the moment he did not know 
how to do it.

RAYMOND F. JONES 



T HE PROGRAM called for a 
continuation well into the night 
with a long scene at the cabin, but 
Ashby interrupted it as soon as they 
returned from Maintown. He or- 
dered a twenty four hour rest, be- 
cause of Bonnie. The extended 
period of sleep wouldn’t harm 
Jorden. 

Bonnie, however, was furious at 
the interruption as she came out of 
the test pit. 

“If you’re going to let it go to 
the end, why don’t you get on with 
it?” she demanded. “The whole 
thing is so far off the track that 
you might as well find out as soon 
as possible that you’re not getting 
anywhere.” 

“I think we’re beginning to find 
out a great deal. But I want you to 
have a rest. The hours of this shift 
are much too long for you.” 

“You think you know what’s go- 
ing on inside Mark Jorden by 
watching the dials and meters, but 
you don’t, because it’s not himself 
he’s concerned about. It’s a goal 
outside and bigger than himself. 
The colony means something to 
him. It never meant anything at all 
to any of the others.” 

“Then this is the kind of situa- 
tion we’ve been looking for.” 

“But we haven’t the techniques 
or insight to understand it. We can 
analyze a man who’s running away 
— but we’re not prepared for one 
who’s running toward ” 

The night after they returned 
from Maintown a terrific storm 
broke over the plateau. It began at 
supper time and for an hour poured 
torrents of water on the land. Jor- 
den wanted to go down to the river 



to see if their diversion dams were 
holding. If they went out it meant 
long days of hard hand labor re- 
storing them. 

He gave in, however, to Bonnie’s 
plea to stay in the house with them. 
Roddy was frightened of the storm 
and looked physically ill when 
thunder made the walls of the 
cabin shake. It wouldn’t change 
the actual facts of the damage to 
the dams whether Jorden exam- 
ined them now or in the morning. 
He tried to think up stories to tell 
the children, but it was hard to 
make up some dealing only with 
Serrengia and ignoring Earth, as 
he had to do for Roddy’s sake. 

After the rain finally stopped 
and Bonnie had put the children to 
bed there came a knock at the door. 
Bonnie opened it. Governor Boggs 
and two of Council members 
moved into the room. Little pools 
of water drained to the floor about 
their feet. 

The Governor turned slowly and 
grinned at Bonnie and Mark Jor- 
den as the light from the lamp and 
the fireplace fell upon him. “Nasty 
night out,” he said. “For a time I 
was afraid we weren’t going to 
make it.” 

Boggs was a short, stout man and 
carried himself very erect. He 
seemed to exaggerate his normal 
posture as he moved toward the 
chairs Bonnie offered the men. 

Jorden remained seated in his 
big wooden chair by the fireplace 
glancing up with cold challenge in 
his face as his visitors settled on 
the opposite side of the fire. 

“I’m sorry we missed you when 
you were in town today,” said 
Boggs. “It was not until late this 




THE COLONISTS 



27 



afternoon that I became aware of 
your visit.” 

He reached to an inner coat 
pocket and drew forth a paper 
which he unfolded carefully. Jor- 
den recognized it as the announce- 
ment he had tacked on the bulletin 
board. Boggs passed it over. 

“I felt sure you would wish to 
withdraw this, Jorden, after you 
had given it a little fuller considera- 
tion. I’m sure that by now you 
have had time to think over the 
matter a little more calmly and find 
a good many reasons why you 
should withdraw your announce- 
ment.” 

“I haven’t thought much about 
it,” said Jorden, “but now that you 
call it to my attention I am becom- 
ing aware of an increasing number 
of reasons why I should not with- 
draw. I assure you I have no in- 
tention of doing so.” 

Boggs smiled and folded up the 
paper and slipped it into the fire. 
“I have not been such a bad ad- 
ministrator during my first term of 
office, have I Jorden?” 

“That is for the people to decide 
— on election day.” 

“But why should they want to 
change a perfectly capable admin- 
istrator,” said Boggs in an injured 
tone, “and put in a very capable 
engineer and farm manager — who 
has no qualifications in adminis- 
trative matters?” 

“That too is a question to be an- 
swered on election day.” 

Boggs shifted in his chair, drop- 
ping the deliberately maintained 
smile from his face. “There have 
been some stories circulating about 
the colony recently,” he said. “It is 
possible that you have heard them 



and believe them.” 

“Possibly,” said Jorden. 

“I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t believe 
them if I were you. I wouldn’t even 
listen to them because it might lead 
to dangerous and erroneous con- 
clusions, which would cause you to 
convict in your mind an honest 
man.” 

“That would be my error then, 
wouldn’t it?” said Jorden. 

The Governor nodded. “A grave 
one as far as it concerns the wel- 
fare of yourself and your family, 
Jorden.” 

Jorden’s face hardened. “Threats 
of that kind aren’t appropriate to 
your position, Governor.” 

“Perhaps you are not aware of 
my exact position.” 

“I think I am! And I intend to 
do everything in my power to 
change it. You are a small time 
chiseler who saw a good chance to 
set yourself up for life in a cushy 
situation where five hundred other 
people would obey your slightest 
whim. That’s an old fashioned 
situation, Boggs, and you can’t set 
it up here even if you are willing 
to resort to sabotage and murder.” 
Boggs eyes narrowed and he 
looked at Jorden for a long time. “I 
am afraid, then,” he said, “that 
there is nothing I can do except put 
a stop to your repeating these lying 
stories about me.” 

The Governor’s eyes never 
moved, but Jorden shifted in sud- 
den, wild indecision. Almost simul- 
taneously there were two shots ex- 
ploding in the narrow cabin, and 
then a third. Jorden and Boggs 
leaped out of their chairs. 

From the kitchen doorway came 
the steel-taut voice of Bonnie. 




28 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



“Don’t move any further, Mr. 
Boggs. Put your hands in the air. 
Get his gun, Mark — in the pocket 
on this side.” 

For a moment Jorden hesitated, 
his eyes held by the sight of Boggs’ 
two gunmen on the floor, blood 
spreading in tiny rivulets. He took 
the pistol from the Governor’s 
pocket and held it in readiness. 

“I ought to kill you now, Boggs,” 
he said. “Fortunately, or unfortu- 
nately, we have to set a precedent 
in such matters if the colony is to 
survive. We have to go through 
the formality of a trial for sabotag- 
ing the power plant and murdering 
those killed there. Actually, it 
would be a good idea if you just 
took off over the hills and went as 
far as you could before the jungle 
got you. It would save us all a great 
deal of trouble.” 

Hope surged in Boggs’ eyes as he 
recognized that Jorden was incapa- 
ble of shooting him down. Then 
bitterness mingled with that hope. 
“You won’t get away with this, 
Jorden. We’ll see what the people 
have to say about your wife shoot- 
ing my men down while my back 
is turned.” 

“Their backs weren’t turned,” 
said Jorden. “Get them out of here 
now. If you want to save explana- 
tions as to why you came here to- 
night you might find a convenient 
spot and bury them — before you 
take out over the hills yourself.” 

Watching until they could no 
longer see the lights of Boggs’ car, 
they closed the door. Bonnie col- 
lapsed with a moan, cringing in 
Jorden’s arms. 

“Now they’ll kill us all,” she said 
in a lifeless voice. “We haven’t got 



a chance. For this we followed your 
great dream of colonizing an out- 
post of the Universe!” 

That night Roddy was sick. Six 
days later he was dead. Before 
they decided to go through with 
this section of the program there 
were long and heated conferences 
between Bonnie and Ashby and the 
staff working at the test pit. Bonnie 
insisted the program should be 
dropped here. They already knew 
that Jorden was what they were 
searching for. They had only to 
analyze the factors that had 
brought him to the test and they 
would have what they needed to 
identify as many colonists as the 
project required. He didn’t need 
to be broken down any further. 

Ashby knew this was not true. 
Jorden’s basic purpose as a colonist 
had not yet been brought into sight. 
Ashby recognized that his goal was 
almost certainly the perpetuation 
of the colony — and he was the first 
one who had maintained such a 
goal this far — but they had to know 
the drive that existed behind the 
goal. If it should develop a basis 
wholly in flight it would still crack 
before completion of the program. 

But Ashby continued to be hesi- 
tant on Bonnie’s account. Roddy’s 
illness and death meant a continu- 
ous tour in the test pit for the full 
six days. And this was cut from the 
scheduled eight it normally occu- 
pied. Why it was impossible for 
Bonnie to reduce her own personal 
tension on the project, Ashby didn’t 
know, but she had become increas- 
ingly susceptible as time went on. 

Word of Jorden’s persistence was 
spreading among the staff person-

Dr. Miller, who was Tibbets in 
the program, came up to his side. 
“What is it, Ashby? Has something 
gone wrong?” 

Ashby shook his head slowly in 
wonder and pointed to the image 
in the viewer. “Look at her,” he 
said. “Can’t you see what has hap- 
pened to Bonnie? We should have 
caught it long ago. No wonder this 
job is tearing her apart — no won- 
der she doesn’t want it to end the 
way it must — or end at all, for that 
matter!” 

“I still don’t see what you are 
talking about,” said Miller in ex- 
asperation. “I don’t see that any- 
thing has happened to her. She 
looks like the same old Bonnie to 
me.” 

“Does she?” said Ashby. “Watch 
her when she looks at Jorden. Can’t 
you see she has fallen in love with 
him?” 

T HERE WAS probably a whole 
class of people like Roddy, Jor- 
den thought. People incapable of 
surviving beyond the world on 
which they were born. Since the 
day of his coming Roddy had 
fought an unceasing battle with 
this hated, alien world of Serrengia. 
He awoke each morning to renew 
the unequal contest before he was 
even out of bed — and knowing fully 
that he was beaten before he 
started. 

Jorden had tried every way he 
knew to instill into his son some of 
his own love for this new world. It 
was a good world and the men who 
grew up on it in the years to come 
would love it with all their hearts. 
But Roddy could not give up his 



reaching back, his longing for 
Earth. He shrank before the prob- 
lem of their doubtful food supply. 
He caught snatches of adult wor- 
ries and nourished them with a 
dark agony that made it appear to 
Jorden sometimes as if the boy were 
walking in a nightmare. 

It had been cruel and brutal to 
bring him. But there was no use 
blaming himself for that. If only 
Bonnie would stop blaming him! 
He couldn’t have known ahead of 
time that Roddy was one of those 
who could not be — transplanted. 
Fervently, he prayed for the boy’s 
life now and vowed that when the 
ships came again he would be free 
to go home. 

And always Bonnie’s eyes were 
upon him. Sitting in the firelight 
of the cabin, he could feel her star- 
ing at him, accusing him, hating 
him for bringing them to Serrengia. 

Once he looked up and caught 
her glance. “Don’t hate me so 
much, Bonnie!” he said. “You’re 
driving Roddy down. I can feel it. 
Reach out to him with your love 
and don’t let him go.” 

But Roddy said later that same 
evening, “Maybe I’ll go back to 
Earth now, Daddy. Do you think 
that’s where little boys go when 
they die?” 

He wanted to return so badly 
that he was willing to die to achieve 
it, Jordon thought. That’s what 
Dr. Babbit said: “Roddy doesn’t 
even want to live, Jorden. As in- 
credible as it seems, he’s literally 
dying of homesickness. I’m afraid 
there’s not a thing I can do for him. 
I’m sorry, but it’s up to you. You 
and Bonnie are the only ones who 
can give him a desire to remain, if 




THE COLONISTS 



31 



anyone can.” 

Roddy’s hate for Serrengia was 
greater than any desire they could 
induce in him to live. With ease, 
he conquered all the miracle drugs 
Dr. Babbit lavished from the col- 
ony’s restricted store. He died on 
the sixth night after Boggs’ visit. 

The funeral was held in the lit- 
tle community church built when 
the colonists first laid out Main- 
town. Mark and Bonnie Jorden 
were almost oblivious to the words 
spoken over the body of Roddy by 
the Reverend Wagner, who had 
come as the colonists’ spiritual ad- 
viser. 

Bonnie’s hands were folded on 
her lap, and she kept her eyes down 
throughout the service. She was 
aware of the agony within Mark 
Jorden. It was a real agony, and 
its strength almost frightened her, 
for she had never before seen such 
a response in any man who had 
gone through the test this far. They 
were men concerned only with 
themselves, incapable of the love 
that Jorden could feel for a son. 

He reached out and took one of 
her hands in his own. She could 
feel the emotion within him, the 
tightening and trembling of his big, 
hard-muscled arm. 

Ashby was watching. Over the 
private communication system that 
linked them he murmured, “Cry, 
Bonnie! Make it real. Make him 
hate himself and everything he’s 
done since he decided to become 
a colonist — if you can! This is 
where we’ve got to find out whether 
he can crack or not — and why.” 

“You can’t break him,” said 
Bonnie. “He’s the strongest man 



I’ve ever known. If you find his 
breaking point it will be when you 
destroy him utterly. You’ve got to 
quit before you reach that point!” 
“All that we’ve done will be use- 
less if we quit now, Bonnie. Just a 
few more hours and then it will 
all be over — ” 

As if his words had touched a 
hidden trigger, she did begin to cry 
with a deep but almost inaudible 
sound and a heavy movement of 
her shoulders. Mark Jorden put his 
arm about her as if to force away 
her grief. 

“I know, Bonnie,” said Ashby 
softly. “I can see in your face 
what’s happened to you. It’s going 
to be all right. Everything doesn’t 
end for you when the test is over.” 
“Oh, shut up!” said Bonnie in a 
sudden rage that made her tears 
come faster. “If I ever work on an- 
other of your damned experiments 
it will be when I’ve lost my senses 
entirely! You don’t know what this 
does to people. I didn’t know either 
— because I didn’t care. But now I 
know — ” 

“You know that no harm results 
after we’ve erased and corrected 
all inadequate reactions at the end 
of the test. You’re letting your feel- 
ings cover up your full awareness 
of what we’re doing.” 

“Yes, and I suppose that when 
it’s over I had better submit to a 
little erasing myself. Then Bonnie 
can go back to work as a little iced 
steel probe for some more of your 
guinea pigs!” 

“Bonnie—!” 

She made no answer to Ashby, 
but lay her head on Jorden’s shoul- 
der while her sobbing subsided, 
How did it happen? she asked her- 




32 

self. It wasn’t anything she had 
wanted. It had just happened. It 
had happened that first day when 
he came in from the field at the 
beginning of the experiment with 
all of the planted background that 
made him think he was meeting 
Bonnie for the thousandth time in- 
stead of the first. 

She was supposed to be an actress 
and receive his husbandly kiss with 
all the skilled mimicry that made 
her so valuable to the lab. But it 
hadn’t been like that. She had 
played sister, mother, daughter, 
wife — a hundred roles to as many 
other tested applicants. For the 
first time she saw one as a human 
being instead of a sociological speci- 
men. That’s the way it was when 
she met Mark Jorden. 

There was no answer to it, she 
thought bitterly as she rested her 
face against his shoulder. Ashby 
was right — just a few more hours 
and it would all be over. All Jor- 
den’s feeling for her as his wife 
was induced by the postulates of 
the test, just as were his feelings for 
Roddy. His subjective reactions 
were real enough, but they would 
vanish when their stimulus was re- 
moved with the test postulates. He 
would look upon the restored 
Roddy as just another little boy — 
and upon Bonnie, the Doctor in 
Sociology, as just another misem- 
ployed female. 

She raised her head and dried 
her eyes as she sensed that the serv- 
ice was ending. Actually, Ashby 
was right, of course. They had to 
go on, and the sooner it came to an 
end the better it would be for her. 
She would submit to alteration of 
her own personal data after the 



RAYMOND F. JONES 

test, she thought. She would let 
them erase all feelings and senti- 
ments she held for Mark Jorden, 
and then she would be as good as 
new. After all, if a sociologist 
couldn’t handle his own reactions 
in a situation of this kind he wasn’t 
of much value in his profession! 

T HE SUN was hot as they re- 
turned from the little burial 
ground near the church. There 
were quite a number of other 
graves besides Roddy’s, but his was 
the loneliest, Jorden thought. He 
had never forgiven them for rob- 
bing him of his home and the only 
world in which he could live. 

He felt the growing coldness of 
Bonnie as they came up to their 
shabby cabin that had once looked 
so brave to him. Serrengia had cost 
him Bonnie, too. Even before 
Roddy. She had remained only be- 
cause it was her duty. 

He took her hand as she put a 
foot on the doorstep. “Bonnie — ” 
She looked at him bitterly, her 
eyes searching his face as if to find 
something of the quality that once 
drew her to him. “Don’t try to say 
it, Mark — there’s nothing left to 
say.” 

He let her go, and the two chil- 
dren followed past him into the 
house. He sat down on the step and 
looked out over the fields that 
edged the river bank. His mind felt 
numbed by Roddy’s passing. Bon- 
nie’s insistent blame made him live 
it over and over again. 

The light from the green of the 
fields was like a caress to his eyes. I 
should hate it, he thought. I should 
hate the whole damned planet for 




THE COLONISTS 



33 



what it’s taken from me. But that’s 
not right — Serrengia hasn’t taken 
anything. It’s only that Bonnie and 
I can’t live in the same world, or 
live the same kind of lives. Roddy 
was like her. But I didn’t know 
then. I didn’t know how either of 
them were. 

We have to go on. There’s no 
going back. Maybe if I’d known, I 
would have made it different for 
all of us. I can’t now, and it would 
be crazy to start hating Serrengia 
for the faults that are in us. Who 
could do anything but love this 
fresh, wild planet of ours—? 

He ought to go down and take a 
look at the field, he thought. He 
rose to go in and tell Bonnie. The 
crops hadn’t had water since 
Roddy took sick. 

He found Bonnie in the bedroom 
with the drawers of their cabinets 
open and their trunk in the middle 
of the floor, its lid thrown back. 
Clothes lay strewn on the bed. 

He felt a slow tightening of his 
scalp and of the skin along the back 
of his neck. “Bonnie — ” 

She straightened and looked into 
his face with cold, distant eyes. 
“I’m packing, Mark,” she said. 
“I’m leaving. I’m going home. The 
girls are going with me. You can 
stay until they dig your grave be- 
side Roddy’s, but I’m going home.” 

Jorden’s face went white. He 
strode forward and caught her by 
the arms. “Bonnie — you know 
there’s no way to go home. There 
won’t be a ship for six years. This 
is home, Bonnie. There’s no other 
place to go.” 

For a moment the set expression 
of her face seemed to melt. She 
frowned as if he had told her some 



mystery she could not fathom. 
Then her countenance cleared and 
its blank determination returned. 
“I’m going home,” she repeated. 
“You can’t stop me. I’ve done all 
a wife can be expected to do. I’ve 
given my son as the price of your 
foolishness. You can’t ask for 
more.” 

He had to get out. He felt that 
if he remained another instant just 
then something inside him would 
explode under the pressure of his 
grief. He went to the front door 
and stood leaning against it while 
he looked over the landscape that 
almost seemed to reach out for him 
in hate as it had for Roddy. So you 
want her, too! he cried inside him- 
self. # 

Alice came up and tugged at his 
hand as he stood there. “What’s 
the matter, Daddy? What’s the 
matter with Mama?” 

He bent down and kissed her 
on the forehead. “Nothing, honey. 
You go and play for a moment 
while I help Mother.” 

“I want to help, too!” 

“Please, Alice—” 

He moved back to the bedroom. 
Bonnie was carefully examining 
each item of apparel she packed in 
the big trunk. She didn’t look up as 
he came in. 

“Bonnie,” he said in a low voice, 
“are you going to leave me?” 

She put down the dress she was 
holding and looked up at him. 
“Yes I’m leaving you,” she said. 
“You’ve got what you wanted — all 
you’ve ever wanted.” She looked 
out towards the fields, shimmering 
in the heat of the day. 

“That’s not true, Bonnie. You 
know it isn’t. I’ve always loved you 




34 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



and needed you, and it’s grown 
greater every hour we’ve been to- 
gether.” 

“Then you’ll have to prove it! 
Give up this hell-world you want us 
to call home, and give us back our 
Earth. If you love me, you can 
prove it.” 

“It’s no test of love to make a 
man give up the goal that means 
his life to him. You’d despise me 
forever if I let you do that to me. 
I’d rather you went away from me 
now with the feeling you have at 
this time, because I’d know I had 
your love — ” 

Bonnie remained still and un- 
moving in his arms, her face 
averted from his. He put his hand 
to her chin and turned her face to 
him. “You do love me, Bonnie? 
That hasn’t changed, has it?” 

She put her head against his 
chest and rocked from side to side 
as if in some agony. “Oh, no — 
Mark! That will never change. 
Damn you, Ashby, damn you — ” 

In the control room Ashby and 
Miller groaned aloud to each other, 
and a technician looked at them 
questioningly, his hand on a switch. 
Ashby shook his head and stared 
at the scene before him. 

Jorden shook Bonnie gently in 
his arms. “Ashby?” he said. “Who’s 
Ashby?” 

Bonnie looked up, the blank de- 
spair on her face again. “I don’t 
remember — ” she said haltingly. 
“Someone I used to — know — ” 

“It makes no difference,” Jorden 
said. “What matters is that you 
love me and you’re going to stay 
with me. Let’s put these things 
away now, darling. I know how 



you’ve felt the past week, but we’ve 
got to put it behind us and look 
forward to the future. Roddy 
would want it that way.” 

“There’s no future to look for- 
ward to,” said Bonnie dully. “Noth- 
ing here on Serrengia. There’s no 
meaning to any of us being here. 
I’m going back to Earth.” 

“It does have a meaning! If I 
could only make you see it. If you 
could only understand why I had 
to come — ” 

“Then tell me if you know! 
You’ve never tried to tell me. You 
live as if you know something so 
deep and secret you can live by it 
every hour of your life and find 
meaning in it. But I can only guess 
at what it is you’ve chosen for your 
god. If it’s anything but some illu- 
sion, put it into words and make 
me know it, too!” 

“I’ve never tried,” said Jorden 
hesitantly. “I’ve never tried to put 
it into words. It’s something I 
didn’t know was in me until I 
heard of the chance to colonize 
Serrengia. And then I knew I had 
to come. 

“It’s like a growing that you feel 
in every cell. It’s a growing out 
and away, and it’s what you have 
to do. You’re a sperm — an ovum — 
and if you don’t leave the parent 
body you die. You don’t have to 
hate what you leave behind as 
James and Boggs and so many of 
the others do. It gave you life, and 
for that you’re grateful. But you’ve 
got to have a life of your own. 

“It’s what I was born to do, 
Bonnie. I didn’t know it was there, 
but now I’ve found it I can’t kill 
it.” 

“You have to kill it — or me.” 




THE COLONISTS 



35 



“You don’t mean that. You’re 
part of me. You’ve been a part of 
me so long you feel what I feel. 
You’re lying, Bonnie, when you say 
you’re going away. You don’t want 
to go. You want to go on with me, 
but something’s holding you back. 
What is it, Bonnie? Tell me what 
it is that holds you back!” 

Her eyes went wide. For a mo- 
ment she thought he was talking 
out of the real situation, not the 
make-believe of the test. Then she 
recognized the impossibility of this. 
Her eyes cast a pleading glance in 
the direction of the observation 
tubes. 

Ashby spoke fiercely: “Go on, 
Bonnie! Don’t lose the tension. 
Push him. We’ve got to know. He’s 
almost there!” 

She moved slowly to the dresser 
where she had laid Jorden’s hunt- 
ing knife previously, as if with no 
particular intent. Now, out of sight 
of Jorden, her hand touched it. 
She picked it up. 

Ashby’s voice came again. “Bon- 
nie — move!” 

She murmured, “Lost — ” 

And then she whirled about, 
knife in hand. She cried aloud. “I 
can’t go on any further! Can’t you 
see this is enough? Stop it! Stop 
it—” 

Jorden leaped for the knife. 

In the observation room a tech- 
nician touched a switch. 



SHBY FELT the subdued ela- 
tion of success reached after a 
long and strenuous effort. Bonnie 
was seated across the desk from 
him, but he sat at an angle so that 
he could see the four hulls out of 



the corner of his eye. One and Two 
had made their test flights and the 
others would not be far behind. 
The expedition would be a success, 
too. There was no longer any doubt 
of that, because he knew now 
where to look for adequate per- 
sonnel. 

“I’m glad I didn’t foul up your 
test completely, anyway,” said Bon- 
nie slowly. “Even if what you say 
about Mark shouldn’t turn out to 
be true.’* 

Ashby moved his chair around to 
face her directly. She was rested, 
and had gone through a mental re- 
orientation which had removed 
some of the tension from her face. 

“You didn’t foul it up at all,” 
he said. “We went far enough to 
learn that he would have survived 
even your suicide, and would have 
continued in his determination to 
carry the colony forward. Nothing 
but his own death will stand in his 
way if he actually sets out on such 
a project. Are you completely sure 
you want to be tied to such a sin- 
gle purposed man as Mark Jorden 
is?” 

“There’s no doubt of that! But 
I just don’t feel as if I can face 
him now — with his knowing . 
How can I ever be sure his feeling 
for me was not merely induced by 
the test experience, and might 
change as time goes on? You 
should have wiped it all out, and 
let us start over from scratch. It 
would have been easier that way.” 

“There isn’t time enough before 
the ships leave. But why should we 
have erased it all? We took away 
the postulates of the test and left 
Bonnie in his memory. His love for 
you didn’t vanish when the test 




36 



RAYMOND F. JONES 



postulates went. As long as he has 
a memory of you he will love you. 
So why make him fall in love with 
you twice? No use wasting so much 
important time at your age. Here 
he comes — ” 

Bonnie felt she couldn’t possibly 
turn around as the door opened 
behind her. She heard Mark’s mo- 
ment of hesitation, his slow steps 
on the carpet. Ashby was smiling a 
little and nodding. Then she felt 
the hard grip of Mark’s hands on 
her shoulders. He drew her up and 
turned her to face him. Her eyes 
were wet. 

“Bonnie — ” he said softly. 

Ashby turned to the window 
again. The gantry cranes were 
hoisting machinery in Hull Three. 
Maybe he had been wrong about 
there not being enough time be- 
tween now and takeoff for Mark 
and Bonnie to discover each other 
all over again. They worked pretty 
fast. But then, as he had men- 
tioned, why waste time at their 

age? 

They were smiling, holding tight 
to each other as Ashby turned back 
from the window. 

“They tell me I passed,” said 
Jorden. “I’m sorry about taking 
your best Social Examiner away 
from you — but as you told me in 
the beginning this colonization 
business is a family affair.” 

“Yes — that happens to be one 
of the few things I was right 
about.” Ashby motioned them to 
the chairs. “Through you we lo- 
cated our major error. It was our 
identifying rebellion with coloniza- 
tion ability. Colonization is not a 
matter of rebellion at all. The two 



factors merely happen to accom- 
pany each other at times. But the 
essence of colonization is a growth 
factor — of the kind you so very ac- 
curately described when Bonnie 
pushed you into digging up some 
insight on the matter. It is so often 
associated with rebellion because 
rebellion is or has been, historically, 
necessary to the exercise of this 
growth factor. 

“The American Colonists, for 
example, were rebels only inciden- 
tally. As a group, they possessed 
a growth factor forcing them be- 
yond the confines of the culture in 
which they lived. It gave them the 
strength for rebellion and successful 
colonization. And it is so easy to 
confuse colonists of that type with 
mere cutthroats, thugs, and misfits. 
The latter may or may not have a 
sufficiently high growth factor. In 
any case, their primary drive is hate 
and fear, which are wholly inade- 
quate motives for successful colo- 
nization. 

“The ideal colonist does not 
break with the parent body, nor 
does he merely extend it. He creates 
a new nucleus capable of inter- 
change with the parent body, but 
not controlled by it. He wants to 
build beyond the current society, 
and the latter is not strong enough 
to pull him back into it. Coloniza- 
tion may take everything else of 
value in life and give nothing but 
itself in return, but the colonists’ 
desire for new life and growth is 
great enough to make this suffi- 
cient. It is not a mere transplant 
of an old life. It is conception and 
gestation and birth. 

“Our present society allows al- 
most unlimited exercise of the 




the colonists 



37 



growth factor in individuals, re- 
gardless of how powerful it may be. 
That is why we have failed to 
colonize the planets. They offer no 
motive or satisfaction sufficient to 
outweigh the satisfactions already 
available. As a result we’ve had vir- 
tually no applicants coming to us 
because of hampered growth. You 
are one of the very few who might 
come under our present approach. 
And even a very slight change of 
occupational conditions would have 
kept you from coming. You didn’t 
want the department leadership 
offered you, because it would limit 
the personally creative functions 
you enjoyed. That one slim, hair- 
breadth factor brought you in.” 

“But how do you expect now to 
get any substantial number of colo- 
nists?” exclaimed Jorden. 

“We’ll put on a recruiting cam- 
paign. We’ll go to the creative 
groups — the engineers, the plan- 
ners, the artists — we’ll show that 
opportunity for creative function- 
ing and growth will be far greater 
in the work of building colonial 
outposts than in any activity they 
now enjoy. And we won’t have to 
exaggerate, either. It’s true. 

“We’ll be able to send out a col- 
ony of whom we can be certain. In 
the past, colonies have invariably 
failed when they consisted only of 
members fleeing from something, 
without possessing an adequate 
growth factor. 

“When this becomes thoroughly 
understood in my field, I shall 
probably never live down my initial 
error of assuming that a colonist 
had to hate or fear what he left be- 
hind in order to leave it forever. 
The exact opposite is true. Success- 



ful colonization of the Universe by 
Earthmen will occur only when 
there is a love and respect for the 
Homeland— and a capacity for 
complete independence from it.” 

Ashby pressed his fingers together 
and looked at his visitors soberly. 
“There is only one thing further,” 
he said. “We’ve found out also that 
Bonnie is not essentially a colo- 
nist — ” 

Bonnie’s face went white. She 
pushed Jorden’s arm away and 
leaned across the desk. “You 
knew — ! Then we can’t — Why 
didn’t you tell me this in the be- 
ginning?” 

“Please don’t be hasty, Bonnie,” 
said Ashby. “As I was about to say, 
we have found, however, that an- 
other condition exists in which you 
can become eligible and stable 
through a genuine love for a quali- 
fied colonist, to the extent you are 
willing to follow him completely in 
his ambitions and desires. This is 
strictly a feminine possibility — a 
woman can become a sort of sec- 
ond order colonist, you might say. 

“Of course, Jorden, you still 
have to make the basic decision as 
to whether you want to go to Ser- 
rengia or not. We have found out 
merely that you can . 33 

“I think there’s no doubt about 
my wanting to,” said Jorden. 

He turned Bonnie around in his 
arms again, and Ashby chuckled 
mildly. “I have always said there is 
no piece of data you cannot find, 
provided you can devise the proper 
experimental procedure for turn- 
ing it up,” he said.

Poor Henry was an unhappy husband whose wife had a habit 
of using bad cliches. Alfear was a genii who was, quite like most 
humans, a creature of habit. T heir murder compact was abso- 
lutely perfect, with —

C OMMITTING a perfect mur- 
der is a simple matter. Drive 
out some night to a lonely road, 
find a single person walking along 
out of sight of anyone else, offer 
him a ride, knife him, and go home. 
In such a crime, there’s no reason 
to connect killer and victim — no 
motive, no clue, no suspect. 

To achieve the perfect murder 
of a man’s own wife, however, is a 
different matter. For obvious rea- 
sons, husbands are always high on 
the suspect list. Who has a better 
reason for such a crime? 

Henry Aimsworth had been pon- 
dering the problem with more than 
academic interest for some time. It 
wasn’t that he hated his wife. He 
simply couldn’t stand the sight or 
sound of her; even thinking about 
her made his flesh crawl. If she had

been willing to give him a divorce, 
he’d have been content to wish her 
all the happiness she was capable 
of discovering. But Emma, unfortu- 
nately, was fond of being his wife; 
perhaps she was even fond of him. 
Worse, she was too rigidly bound to 
trite morality to give him grounds 
to sue. 

There was no hope of her stray- 
ing. What had been good enough 
for her mother was good enough 
for her, and saved all need of think- 
ing; a woman needed a husband, 
her place was in the home, marriage 
was forever, and what would the 
neighbors think? Anyhow, she’d 
have had difficulty being unfaith- 
ful, even if she tried. She’d been 
gaining some ten pounds every year 
for the eleven years they had been 
married, and she’d long since

stopped worrying about taking care 
of her appearance. 

He looked up at her now, letting 
the book drop to his lap. She sat 
watching the television screen with 
a vacant look on her face, while 
some comic went through a tired 
routine. If she enjoyed it, there was 
no sign, though she spent half her 
life in front of the screen. Then the 
comic went off, and dancers came 
on. She went back to darning a pair 
of his socks, as seriously as if she 
didn’t know that he had always re- 
fused to wear the lumpy results. 
Her stockings had runs, and she 
still wore the faded apron in which 
she’d cooked supper. 

He contrasted her with Shirley 
unconsciously, and shuddered. In. 
the year since Shirley Bates had 
come to work in his rare book store, 
he’d done a lot of such shuddering, 
and never because of the slim 
blonde warmth of his assistant. 
Since that hot day in August when 
they’d closed the shop early and 
he’d suggested a ride in the coun- 
try to cool off, he and Shirley . 

He was interrupted in his more 
pleasant thoughts by the crash of 
scissors onto the floor, and his eyes 
focussed on the deepening folds of 
fat as Emma bent to retrieve them. 
“Company coming,” she said, be- 
fore he could think of anything to 
prevent the mistaken cliche. Then 
she became aware that he was star- 
ing at her. “Did you take the gar- 
bage out, Henry?” 

“Yes, dear,” he answered wood- 
enly. Then, because he knew it was 
coming anyhow, he filled in the in- 
evitable. “Cleanliness is next to 
godliness.” 

She nodded solemnly, and began 



putting aside her darning. “That’s 
finished. Mama always said a stitch 
in time saves nine. If you’d cut your 
toenails, Henry . .” 

He could feel his skin begin to 
tingle with irritation. But there was 
no escape. If he went upstairs to his 
bedroom, she’d be up at once, put- 
tering about. If he went to the base- 
ment, she’d find the canned food 
needed checking. A woman’s place 
was with her husband, as she’d re- 
peatedly told him. Probably she 
couldn’t stand her own company, 
either. 

Then he remembered something 
he’d stored away. “There’s a new 
picture at the Metro,” he said as 
quietly as he could. “Taylor’s 
starred, I think. I was going to 
take you, before this extra work 
came up.” 

He could see her take the bait and 
nibble at it. She had some vague 
crush left for Taylor. She stared at 
the television set, shifted her bulk, 
and then shook her head reluctant- 
ly. “It’d be nice, Henry. But go- 
ing at night costs so much, and — 
well, a penny saved is a penny 
earned.” 

“Exactly. That’s what I meant 
to say.” He even relaxed enough 
to overlook the platitude, now that 
there was some hope. “I saved the 
price of lunch today. The nut who 
wanted King in Yellow was so 
tickled to get the copy finally, he in- 
sisted on treating. You can even 
take a cab home afterwards.” 

“That’s nice. It’ll probably rain, 
the way my bunion’s been aching.” 
She considered it a second more, 
before cutting off the television. He 
watched as she drew off the apron 
and went for her coat and hat.

making a pretense of dabbing on 
make-up. She might as well have 
worn the apron, he decided, as she 
came over to kiss him a damp good- 
bye. 

H E CONSIDERED calling Shir- 
ley, but her mother was visit- 
ing her, and the conversation would 
have to be too guarded at her end. 
If he could find some way of get- 
ting rid of Emma . 

It wouldn’t even be murder, 
really. More like destroying a vege- 
table — certainly no worse than end- 
ing the life of a dumb cow to make 
man’s life more worth living. It 
wasn’t as if she had anything to live 
for or to contribute. It would al- 
most be a kindness, since she lived 
in a perpetual state of vague dis- 
content and unhappiness, as if 
somehow aware that she had lost 
herself. But unfortunately, the law 
wouldn’t look at it in such a light. 

He’d only been thinking actively 
of getting her out of the way since 
August, however; and somehow, 
with time, there must be some fool- 
proof scheme. There was that alco- 
hol-injection system — but it re- 
quired someone who would drink 
pretty freely first, and Emma was 
a teetotaler. Maybe, though, if he 
could get her to taking some of 
those tonics for women . 

He dropped it for the moment 
and turned back to the book. It was 
an odd old volume he’d received 
with a shipment for appraisal. 
There was no title or date, but the 
strange leather binding showed it 
was old. Apparently it had been 
hand-set and printed on some tiny 
press by the writer, whose name was 



omitted. It seemed to be a mixture 
of instructions on how to work 
spells, conjure demons, and prac- 
tice witchcraft, along with bitter 
tirades against the group who had 
driven the writer out and forced 
him, as he put it, to enter a compact 
with the devil for to be a wizard, 
which is like to a male witch. 
Henry had been reading it idly, 
slowly deciding the book was 
authentic enough, however crazy 
the writer was. The book had no 
particular value as a collector’s 
item, but he could probably get a 
fine price from some of the local 
cultists, particularly since there 
were constant promises in it that 
the writer was going to give a sure- 
fire, positive and simple recipe for 
conjuring up a demon without need 
of virgin blood, graveyard earth or 
unicorn horn. 

He skimmed through it, looking 
for the formula. It turned up on the 
fifth page from the end, and was 
everything the writer had claimed. 
A five-sided figure drawn on the 
floor with ordinary candle wax, a 
pinch of sugar inside, a bit of some- 
thing bitter outside, two odd but 
simple finger gestures, and a string 
of words in bad Latin and worse 
Greek. There was a warning that it 
would work without the penta- 
gram, sugar and bitters, but at par- 
lous risk to the conjurer without 
such protection. 

He frowned. Too simple for the 
cultists, he realized — unless he 
could somehow persuade them that 
the trick lay in some exact phras- 
ing or gesturing pattern which took 
experiment. They liked things made 
difficult, so they’d have a good alibi 
for their faith when the tricks 




42 



LESTER del REY 



failed. If he could show them in 
advance that it didn’t work, but 
hint that a good occultist might 
figure out the right rhythm, or 
whatever . 

He read it through again, trying 
to memorize the whole thing. The 
gestures were — so — and the words 
— umm . 

There was no flash of fire, no 
smell of sulphur, and no clap of 
thunder. There was simply a tall 
creature with yellowish skin and 
flashing yellow eyes standing in 
front of the television set. His head 
was completely hairless, and he was 
so tall that he had to duck slightly 
to keep from crashing into the ceil- 
ing. His features were too sharp for 
any human face. There were no 
scales, however; his gold cape and 
black tights were spangled, and he 
wore green shoes with turned up 
toes. But generally, he wasn’t bad 
looking. 

“Mind if I sit down?” the crea- 
ture asked. He took Henry’s assent 
for granted and dropped into Em- 
ma’s chair, folding his cape over 
one arm and reaching for an apple 
on the side table. “Glad to see 
you’re not superstitious enough to 
keep me locked up in one of those 
damned pentagrams. Drat it, I 
thought the last copy of that book 
was burned and I was free. Your 
signal caught me in the middle of 
dinner.” 



H ENRY swallowed thickly, feel- 
ing the sweat trickle down his 
nose. The book had warned against 
summoning the demon without the 
protective devices! But the thing 
seemed peaceful enough for the 



moment. He cleared his voice. “You 
mean — you mean magic works?” 

“Magic — shmagic!” the creature 
snorted. He jerked his thumb to- 
ward the television. “To old Eph- 
riam — the crackpot who wrote the 
book before he went completely 
crazy — that set would have been 
more magic than I am. I thought 
this age knew about dimensions, 
planes of vibrations, and simultan- 
eous universes. You humans always 
were a backward race, but you 
seemed to be learning the basic 
facts. Hell, I suppose that means 
you’ll lay a geas on me, after I was 
hoping it was just an experimental 
summons!” 

Henry puzzled it over, with some 
of the fright leaving him. The scien- 
tific sounding terms somehow took 
some of the magic off the appear- 
ance of the thing. “You mean those 
passes and words set up some sort 
of vibrational pattern . .” 

The hairless fellow snorted again, 
and began attacking the grapes. 
“Bunk, Henry! Oh, my name’s Al- 
fear, by the way. I mean I was a 
fool. I should have gone to my 
psychiatrist and taken the fifty year 
course, as he advised. But I thought 
the books were all burned and no- 
body knew the summons. So here I 
am, stuck with the habit. Because 
that’s all it is — a conditioned re- 
flex. Pure compulsory behavior. I’m 
sensitized to receive the summons, 
and when it comes, I teleport into 
your plane just the way you pull 
your hand off a hot stove. You read 
the whole book, I suppose? Yeah, 
just my luqk. Then you know I’m 
stuck with any job you give me — 
practically your slave. I can’t even 
get back without dismissal or finish- 




NO STRINGS ATTACHED

ing your task ! That’s what comes of 
saving money by not going to my 
psychiatrist.” 

He muttered unhappily, reach- 
ing for more grapes, while Henry 
began to decide nothing was going 
to happen to him, at least physical- 
ly. Souls were things he wasn’t quite 
sure of, but he couldn’t see how 
just talking to Alfear could endan- 
ger his. 

“Still,” the creature said thought- 
fully, “it could be worse. No penta- 
gram. I never did get mixed up 
with some of the foul odors and 
messes some of my friends had to 
take. And I’ve developed quite a 
taste for sugar; tobacco, too.” He 
reached out and plucked a cigarette 
out of Henry’s pack, then a book 
of matches. He lighted it, inhaled, 
and rubbed the flame out on his 
other palm. “Kind of weak tobac- 
co, but not bad. Any more questions 
while I smoke this? There’s no free 
oxygen where I come from, so I 
can’t smoke there.” 

“But if you demons answer such 
— such summons, why don’t people 
know about it now?” Henry asked. 
“I’d think more and more people 
would be going in for this sort of 
thing. If the wizards were right all 
along . 

“They weren’t, and we’re not 
demons. It didn’t get started until 
your Middle Ages. And if it hadn’t 
been for old Apalon . .” Alfear 
lighted another cigarette off the 
butt, which he proceeded to ex- 
tinguish on the tip of his sharp 
tongue. He scratched his head 
thoughtfully, and then went on. 

“Apalon was studying your wor- 
ship. You see, we’ve been studying 
your race the way you study white 



rats, using lower races to explain 
our own behavior. Anyhow, he got 
curious and figured out a way to 
mentalize himself into your plane. 
He was sort of a practical joker, 
you might say. So he picked a time 
when some half-crazy witch was 
trying to call up the being you wor- 
ship as Satan to make some kind 
of a deal. Just as she finished, he 
popped up in front of her, spitting 
out a bunch of phosphorus to make 
a nice smoke and fire effect, and 
agreed with all her mumbo- jumbo 
about having to do what she 
wanted. She wanted her heart fixed 
up then, so he showed her how to 
use belladonna and went back, fig- 
uring it was a fine joke. 

“Only he made a mistake. There’s 
something about moving between 
planes that lowers the resistance to 
conditioning. Some of our people 
can take five or six trips, but Apa- 
lon was one of those who was so 
conditioning-prone that he had the 
habit fixed after the first trip. The 
next time she did the rigamarole, 
back he popped. He had to dig up 
gold for her, hypnotize a local baron 
into marrying her, and generally 
keep on the constant qui vive, un- 
til she got sloppy and forgot the 
pentagram she thought protected 
her and which he was conditioned 
to. But after he disintegrated her, 
he found she’d passed on the word 
to a couple of other witches. And 
he knew somebody at the Institute 
was bound to find what a fool he’d 
made of himself. 

“So he began taking members 
aside and telling them about the 
trick of getting into your world. 
Excellent chance for study. Have 
to humor the humans by sticking 




44 



LESTER del REY 



to their superstitions, of course. One 
by one, they went over on little 
trips. It wasn’t hard to find some 
superstitious dolt trying to summon 
something, since word had got 
around in your world. One of us 
would pop up, and that spread the 
word further. Anyhow, when Apa- 
lon was sure each member had 
made enough trips to be condi- 
tioned, he’d tell him the sad truth, 
and swear him to secrecy on pen- 
alty of being laughed out of the In- 
stitute. The old blaggard wound up 
with all of us conditioned. There 
was quite a flurry of witchcraft 
here, until we finally found a psy- 
chiatrist who could break the habit 
for us. Even then, it was tough go- 
ing. We’d never have made it with- 
out the inquisitions and witch-burn- 
ings one of our experimental socio- 
logists managed to stir up.” 

Alfear put out the third cigarette 
butt and stood up slowly. “Look, I 
don’t mind a chat now and then, 
but my wives are waiting dinner. 
How about dismissing me?” 

“Umm.” Henry had been think- 
ing while he listened. It had 
sounded like a reasonable explana- 
tion on the whole, except for the 
bit about Apalon’s disintegrating 
the witch. Apparently as long as a 
man wasn’t too unreasonable, 
there was a certain usefulness to 
having such friends on call. “What 
about the price for your help? I 
mean — well, about souls . .” 

Alfear twitched his ears dis- 
gustedly. “What the deuce would 
I do with your soul, Henry? Eat 
it? Wear it? Don’t be a shnook!” 
“Well, then — well, I’ve heard 
about wishes that were granted, 
but they all had a trick attached. 



If I asked for immortality, you’d 
give it, say; but then I’d get some 
horrible disease and beg and plead 
for death. Or ask for money, and 
then find the money was recorded 
as being paid to a kidnaper, or 
something.” 

“In the first place, I couldn’t 
give you immortality,” Alfear said, 
as patiently as he apparently could. 
“Your metabolism’s not like ours. 
In the second place, why should I 
look for tainted money? It’s enough 
nuisance doing what you ask, with- 
out looking for tricks to pull. Any- 
how, I told you I half-enjoy visit- 
ing here. As long as you’re reason- 
able about it, I don’t mind keeping 
my end of the compulsion going. 
If you’ve got something to ask, ask 
away. There are no strings at- 
tached.” 

The creature seemed to be quite 
sincere. Henry considered it brief- 
ly, staring at a large tinted picture 
of Emma, and took the plunge. 
“Suppose I asked you to kill my 
wife for me — say by what looked 
like a stroke, so nobody would 
blame me?” 

“That seems reasonable enough,” 
Alfear agreed easily. “I could break 
a few blood vessels inside her skull 
. Sure, why not? Only the pic- 
ture in your mind is so distorted, I 
wouldn’t know her. If she’s like 
that, why’d you ever marry her?” 

“Because she seemed different 
from other women, I guess,” Henry 
admitted. “When I tipped the ca- 
noe over, and I figured she’d be 
mad because her dress was ruined, 
all she said was something about 
not being sugar, so she wouldn’t 
melt.” He shuddered, remember- 
ing all the times she’d said it since. 




NO STRINGS ATTACHED

“You won’t have any trouble. Look, 
can you really read my mind?” 

“Naturally. But it’s all disor- 
ganized.” 

“Umm. Well.” It gave him a 
queasy feeling to think of anyone 
seeing his secret thoughts. But this 
fellow apparently didn’t work by 
human attitudes, anyhow. He 
groped about, and then smiled 
grimly. “All right, then. You can 
tell I think of her as my wife. And 
just to make sure, she’ll be sure to 
say something about early to bed 
and early to rise ; she says that every 
single damned night, Alfear! She 
never misses.” 

Alfear grunted. “Sounds more 
reasonable every minute, Henry. 
All right, when your wife says that, 
I pop out and give her a stroke that 
will kill her. How about dismissing 
me now?” 

“No strings?” Henry asked. He 
watched carefully as Alfear nodded 
assent, and he could see no sign of 
cunning or trickery. He caught his 
breath, nodded, and closed his eyes. 
Seeing something vanish was noth- 
ing he wanted. “Dismissed.” 

T HE FRUIT was still gone when 
he opened his eyes, but there 
was no other sign of the thing. He 
found some fruit still in the refrig- 
erator and restocked the bowl. Then 
he closed the strange book and put 
it away. He’d have to buy it him- 
self, and burn it to make sure no 
one else found the trick, of course. 
For a moment, uneasiness pricked 
at him. Yet he was sure Alfear 
hadn’t been lying, and the story 
the creature had told made more 
sense than the older superstitions. 



Henry adjusted his mind to having 
a well-conditioned demon on tap 
and then began the harder job of 
bracing himself for Emma’s inco- 
herent but detailed account of the 
movie when she came back. 

Unfortunately, it was a more 
complicated plot than usual, and 
she went on and on, from the mo- 
ment she entered the door. He tried 
to close his ears, but he’d never suc- 
ceeded in that. He yawned, and she 
yawned back, but went on until the 
last final morsel was covered for the 
second or third time. 

“He was wonderful,” she finally 
concluded. “Just wonderful. Only 
I wished you’d come with me. 
You’d have liked it. Henry, did you 
take the garbage out?” 

“Yes, dear,” he answered. 
“Hours ago.” 

He yawned elaborately again. 
She mumbled something about hav- 
ing to keep the kitchen clean be- 
cause cleanliness was next to god- 
liness, but her automatic yawn 
muffled the words. Then she 
glanced at the clock. “Heavens, it’s 
almost one! And early to bed and 
early to rise . .” 

Henry jerked his eyes away, just 
as he caught the first glimpse of 
Alfear popping into existence be- 
side her. He heard the beginning of 
a shriek change to a horrible gar- 
gling and then become a dying 
moan. Something soft and heavy 
hit the floor with a dull thud. Henry 
turned around slowly. 

“Dead,” Alfear said calmly, rub- 
bing one of his fingers. “This busi- 
ness of getting just one finger 
through the planes into her head 
cuts off the circulation. There, that’s 
better. Satisfied?” 




46

Henry dropped beside the corpse. 
She was dead, according to the 
mirror test, and there wasn’t a mark 
on her. He stared at the puffy, re- 
laxed features; he’d expected an 
expression of horror, but she seemed 
simply asleep. His initial feeling of 
pity and contrition vanished; after 
all, it had been quick and nearly 
painless. Now he was free! 

“Thanks, Alfear,” lie said. “It’s 
fine — fine. Do I dismiss you now?” 
“No need this time. I’m free as 
soon as the job’s done. Unless you’d 
like to talk awhile . .” 

Henry shook his head quickly. 
He had to telephone a doctor. Then 
he could call Shirley — her mother 
would be gone by now. “Not now. 
Maybe I’ll summon you sometime 
for a smoke or something. But not 
now!” 

“Okay,” Alfear said, and van- 
ished. Surprisingly, seeing him dis- 
appear wasn’t unpleasant, after all. 
He just wasn’t there. 

Waiting for the doctor was the 
worst part of it. All the legends 
Henry knew ran through his mind. 
Alfear could have given her a stroke 
and then added some violent poison 
that would show up in an autopsy. 
He could be sitting wherever he 
was, chuckling because Henry 
hadn’t restricted his wish enough 
to be safe. Or any of a hundred 
things could happen. There was the 
first witch, who had thought she 
had Apalon under control, only to 
be turned to dust. 

But the doctor took it calmly 
enough. “Stroke, all right,” he de- 
cided. “I warned her last year that 
she was putting on too much weight 
and getting high blood pressure. 
Too bad, Mr. Aimsworth, but there 



was nothing you could do. I’ll turn 
in a certificate. Want me to contact 
a mortician for you?” 

Henry nodded, trying to appear 
properly grief-stricken. “I — I’d ap- 
preciate it.” 

“Too late now,” the doctor said. 
“But I’ll be glad to send Mr. 
Glazier around in the morning.” 
He pulled the sheet up over Em- 
ma’s body, leaving it on the back- 
room couch to which they had car- 
ried it. “You’d better go to a hotel 
for the night. And I’ll give you 
something that will make you 
sleep.” 

“I’d rather not,” Henry said 
quickly. “I mean, I’d feel better 
here. You know . 

“Certainly, certainly.” The doc- 
tor nodded sympathetically, but as 
if it were an old story to him. He 
left the pills with instructions, said 
the proper things again, and finally 
went out. 



S HIRLEY’S voice was sleepy and 
cross when she answered, but 
it grew alert as soon as he told 
her about Emma’s stroke. He was 
almost beginning to believe the sim- 
ple version of the story himself. 

“Poor Henry,” she murmured. 
Her voice sharpened again. “It was 
a stroke? The doctor was sure?” 
“Positive,” he assured her, curs- 
ing himself for having let her guess 
some of the thoughts that had been 
on his mind. “The doctor said she’d 
had hypertension and such before.” 
She considered it a second, and 
then a faint laugh sounded. “Then 
I guess there’s no use in crying over 
spilled milk, is there, Henry? If it 
had to happen, it just had to. And

I mean, it’s like fate, almost!” 

“It is fate!” he agreed happily. 
Then he dropped his voice. “And 
now I’m all alone here, baby lamb, 
and I had to call you up . .” 

She caught on at once, as she al- 
ways did. “You can’t stay there 
now! It’s so morbid. Henry, you 
come right over here!” 

Demons, Henry thought as he 
drove the car through the quiet 
residential streets toward her apart- 
ment, had their uses. They were a 
much maligned breed. Probably the 
people who had summoned them 
before had been ignorant, stupid 
people ; they’d messed up their 
chances and brought trouble on 
themselves by not finding out the 
facts and putting it all down to su- 
perstitious magic. The fellows were 
almost people — maybe even a little 
superior to humans. If a man would 
just try to understand them, they 
could help him, and with no dan- 
ger at all. 

“No strings attached,” he said to 
himself, and then chuckled softly. 
It fitted perfectly; now there were 
no strings attached to him. Emma 
was at peace, and he was free. He’d 
have to wait a few months to marry 
Shirley legally, of course. But al- 
ready, she was as good as his wife. 
And if he played up the shock an- 
gle just enough, this could be a 
wonderful evening again ... 

Shirley was unusually lovely 
when she met him at the door. Her 
soft golden hair made a halo for 
her face — a face that said she’d al- 
ready anticipated his ideas, and had 
decided he was a man who needed 
sympathy and understanding for 
what had happened. 

There was even time for the idea 



that he was free to be brought up, 
tentatively at first, and then even- 
tually as a matter of course. And 
the plans expanded as he consid- 
ered them. There was no need to 
worry about things now. The quiet 
marriage became a trip around the 
world as he confessed to having 
money that no one knew about. 
They could close the shop. He could 
leave town almost at once, and she 
could follow later. Nobody would 
know, and they wouldn’t have to 
wait to avoid any scandal. They 
could be married *in two weeks! 

Henry was just realizing the val- 
ues of a friendly demon. With 
proper handling, a lot of purely 
friendly summoning, and a reason- 
able attitude, there was no reason 
why Alf6ar couldn’t provide him 
with every worldly comfort to share 
with Shirley. 

He caught her to him again. “My 
own little wife! That’s what you 
are, lambkins! What’s a mere piece 
of paper? I already think of you as 
my wife. I feel you’re my wife. 
That’s what counts, isn’t it?” 

“That’s all that counts,” she 
agreed with a warmth that set fire 
to his blood. Then she gasped. 
“Henry, darling, it’s getting light 
already! You’ll have to get back. 
What will the neighbors say if they 
see you coming from here now?” 

He tore away reluctantly, swear- 
ing at the neighbors. But she was 
right, of course. He had to go back 
and take the sleeping medicine to 
be ready for the arrival of the mor- 
tician in the morning. 

“It’s still early,” he protested, 
automatically trying to squeeze out 
a few more minutes. “Nobody’s up 
yet.”

“I’ll heat up the coffee, and then 
you’ll have to go,” Shirley said 
firmly, heading for the kitchen. 
“Plenty of people get up early 
around here. And besides, you 
need some sleep. Early to bed and 
early to rise, makes a man healthy, 
wealthy and — ” 

From the kitchen came the 
beginning of a shriek. It changed 
to a horrible gasp, and died away in 
a failing moan. .There was the sound 
of a body hitting the floor. 



LESTER del REY 

Alfear stood over Shirley’s body, 
rubbing one finger tenderly. His 
ears twitched uncertainly as he 
studied Henry’s horror-frozen face. 
“I told you,” he said. “I warned 
you some of us get conditioned to a 
habit the first time. And you 
thought of her as your wife and she 
said . 

Abruptly, he vanished. Henry’s 
screams were the only sound in the 
apartment.

THE HUMAN MIND 

By Fritz Leiber 



D EAR FRIEND, I suppose you 
are taking it easy as you read 
this. You are lying down, sitting, 
or possibly straphanging. Outside 
of the possibility of unexpected 
atom bombs and smaller commo- 
tions, you feel quite safe. 

I’m sorry to tell you, but you 
aren’t. 

The human mind can be snared 
quite as easily as the human body 
can be atomized. The modern 
witch-doctors have an astonishing 
armory of new weapons, which they 
they are probably trying out on you 
right now. Even the magazine in 
your hands (I humbly apologize to 
the editor) could be a threat. 

There’s a rat at the University of 
California. He has a radio in his 
skull. Dr. Joseph Gengerelli inserted 
it there surgically. For the very best 
scientific purposes. Dr. Gengerelli 
is showing, among other things, 



that he can control a rat from a 
distance. 

From the midget radio a very tiny 
wire leads into the rat’s brain 
through a very tiny hole drilled in 
its skull. When Dr. Gengerelli starts 
broadcasting, the rat gets the jit- 
ters and runs “erratically about”. 
All because Dr. Gengerelli has 
pushed a button. The learned scien- 
tist and his button might be on the 
moon and it would still work, if he 
had a strong enough broadcasting 
set. If all the rats in the world were 
so equipped, they would all get the 
jitters. 

This type of experiment has been 
carried a lot further, working with 
monkeys. These primates have had 
not one, but dozens of tiny wires in- 
serted in different parts of their 
brains, from a central radio receiv- 
er permanently set in the skull. The 
wires are insulated up to the point 




50 



FRITZ LEIBER 



where they touch a selected bit of 
gray matter. Radio control allows 
any selected part of the monkey’s 
brain to be stimulated electrically. 
Sometimes the result is a violent 
dislike of bananas. Sometimes the 
monkey finds himself with ten times 
as much appetite as usual. Some- 
times he gets violently aggressive, 
and sometimes he fawns. It all de- 
pends on which button is pushed. 

Could anything like this be done 
in a practical way to human beings? 
Surely not. But according to the 
Signal Corps Engineering Labora- 
tory at Fort Monmouth, New Jer- 
sey, a wrist-watch size radio re- 
ceiver has been perfected that hears 
up to 40 miles. It is made of five 
transistors, a pencil-tip battery, a 
tiny earphone like that of a hearing 
aid, and an antenna that fits inside 
a man’s sleeve. 

Meanwhile General Electric has 
developed a radio transmitter 
which, including the microphone, 
is no bigger than a cigarette case. So 
far it has a range of only 70 feet, 
but we all know what technology 
can do to a “so far”. 

Technologically-shrunken ver- 
sions of such radio transmitters and 
receivers could be surgically in- 
serted into the human body. Spe- 
cifically, near the skull, ear and 
vocal chords, or connected to those 
by wires. The skin would be grown 
back over them again, just as it is 
over a plastic or metal hip joint. 
Such radios would report back to 
headquarters every word a man or 
woman said, they would even keep 
check on his half -whispered, or sub- 
vocal thinking. They would send 
him orders through an implanted 
earphone. They might even, if the 



tiny holes in the skull were 
drilled and the wires inserted, con- 
trol his emotions. Finally a midget 
bomb might be implanted in the 
flesh, set to explode at the proper 
radio signal. 

While it might be wasteful to out- 
fit an army this way, considering 
how age-old methods of discipline 
achieve comparable results, such 
surgeried-in devices could be used 
to advantage on spies, soldiers on 
suicidal missions, suspected traitors 
and persons with top-secret infor- 
mation. 

But how would it really help 
headquarters to give a man a vio- 
lent dislike for bananas, or punch 
a button to make him aggressive, 
or decide from his sub-vocal mut- 
terings that he wasn’t being ag- 
gressive enough and so blow him 
up at long distance? 

The answer is that these are 
things that could be done today. 
With our rapidly increasing knowl- 
edge of the human brain, control 
will become much subtler. For that 
matter, maybe it has already 'be- 
come much subtler. Maybe you are 
haunted, as I am, by the uneasy 
feeling that we people outside the 
barriers of military and govern- 
mental security simply don’t know 
the tenth of it. Heck, at some mo- 
ments I am afraid that I think cer- 
tain thoughts simply because some 
propaganda bureau has already in- 
vaded the inmost recesses of my 
brain. 

Of course there are a lot more 
axlike methods than implanted 
radios of influencing the activities 
of the human brain — methods 
which have been popular in hospi- 
tals and clinics for some twenty 




SNARING THE HUMAN MIND 



51 



years. I am referring to those meth- 
ods which destroy a part of the 
brain slowly by long series of elec- 
tric shocks (or insulin or metrazol 
injections), or quickly by the sur- 
geon’s knife or probe. 

In lobotomy and its sister oper- 
ations a part of the brain is de- 
stroyed and as a result the person so 
favored does not bother about 
things so much. For instance, if he 
is against the government, he gives 
up this idealistic pursuit and takes 
up chasing food or women. Which 
makes it easier for his keepers. 

It has been suggested, by the 
French scientist Christian Favre, 
that lobotomy may be one of the 
key weapons of dictators. Imagine 
that the dictator has captured an 
enemy of his regime who cannot 
be broken down by torture. A clever 
twist of the surgeon’s knife inside 
his brain and he is turned into a 
vegetable, a creature who can be 
drilled into saying whatever the 
prosecuting attorney wants to hear. 

Would scars show that such sur- 
gery has been performed? The sur- 
geon’s probe, inserted between the 
eyeball and the muscles around it, 
can reach the brain and destroy the 
necessary part, leaving no outward 
trace. 

Electro-shock, on the other hand, 
probably does no damage to the 
brain except when treatments are 
repeated many times. But it has 
been used as a threat to get neu- 
rotic soldiers back into the fighting 
lines. Some psychiatrists believe 
that electro-shock is effective most- 
ly because dread of it, much like 
the old snake-pits and whippings 
for lunatics, scares the patient back 
into a semblance of sanity. 



IT IS NATURAL that we should 
I feel a spontaneous revulsion at 
the idea of invading the human 
brain by knife or even electricity. 
For a long time investigation of the 
living human brain was taboo. The 
idea was that if it was bad to cut 
into the human body, it was much 
more indecent to cut into the seat 
of reason. Knowledge of the brain 
was gained during necessary and 
rare surgical operations, when a 
willing subject would permit the 
surface of his brain to be given a 
mild electrical stimulation in dif- 
ferent places, the subject reporting 
what he felt. Now it is possible to 
study the brain without piercing the 
skull. One method is by recording 
the well-known brain waves, those 
mixed and faint electrical rhythms 
that can be picked up by moist 
electrical contacts on the head. 

But this is not thought-control. 
Brain waves cannot as yet be 
beamed back into the skull to con- 
trol a man’s activities. 

Yet recently it has been discov- 
ered that brain waves can (in a 
sense) be effectively turned back on 
the brain to control it, not in the 
form of electricity, but light. At the 
Burden Neurological Institute in 
Bristol, England, physiologist Grey 
Walter gives people what he calls 
flicker-fits. While a person’s brain 
waves are being recorded, a bright 
light that flickers about ten times a 
second is shined into his eyes. Then 
the timing of the flashes is changed 
so that they are in exact rhythm 
with one of the chief brain waves. 

At this point the person begins to 
see things that are not there, and 
not only see but also feel and touch. 
He may experience an inexplicible 




52 



FRITZ LEIBER 



disgust, or intense pleasure. Finally 
he begins to have convulsions like 
those of an epileptic. At this point 
Grey Walters switches off the light. 

But suppose he didn’t. Gould 
brilliant, rapidly flickering star- 
shells strike down an army with 
artificial epilepsy? 

One thing that Grey Walter’s 
subjects frequently see in their 
flicker-fits is a spiral, a light that 
whirls out from a center in tight but 
rapidly widening circles. This is a 
common scanning pattern — a way 
of inspecting every part of an area, 
just as a boy might hunt for a lost 
baseball by circling out from a cen- 
tral point. TV does the same thing 
in getting or reproducing a picture, 
except that it works in straight lines, 
back and forth. 

Grey Walter believes that here 
we have evidence that the thinking 
part of the brain is scanning the 
seeing part of the brain, which is 
located in the back of the head, to 
see what pictures have been trans- 
mitted there from the retina of the 
eye. 

This is an example of the way 
the brain is being investigated these 
days. Here is another: physiolo- 
gists have speculated about the sense 
of smell for a long time. They 
have tried to reduce it to something 
like the simple sweet-salt-bitter- 
sour of the sense of taste. All sorts 
of experts, including the suavest 
French wine-tasters and the most 
judicial British tea-samplers, have 
tried to describe just what they were 
smelling. But they did not reach 
conclusions. 

Now Raymond Hainer, an in- 
dustrial scientist in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, has tackled this 



problem from brain-side, rather 
than nose-side. He finds that there 
are 24 different types of odor-sen- 
sitive nerves leading from the nose 
to the brain. Depending on which 
nerves are stimulated and which 
are not, the brain can sense about 
16 million different odors. No won- 
der the experts couldn’t find a vo- 
cabulary to describe smells accu- 
rately. 

These examples show the care- 
fully detailed way the human 
brain is being examined these days. 
For several years scientists like Nor- 
bert Wiener of M. I. T. (see IF, 
January issue) have been hinting 
to us that the brain is a calculating 
machine. And just like slot-ma- 
chines, calculating machines can be 
gimmicked to give whatever re- 
sults and pay off on whatever per- 
centages the mechanic who adjusts 
them chooses. 

Do you want your brain gim- 
micked? Neither do I. But we’ll 
have to watch out for it in the fu- 
ture. 

For a long time the robot of fic- 
tion has been the machine built to 
imitate man. Now it is turning out 
that man himself is a robot, a vast- 
ly complex electro-chemical circuit 
that can nevertheless be gimmicked 
by a clever operator. 

Yet the gimmicking of the human 
brain is far from a modern wonder. 
It is something that was going on 
long before the first priest of Am- 
mon talked through a tube whose 
outlet was the mouth of the statue 
of the god for whom he was solicit- 
ing. It started with the first witch- 
doctor to discover the cosmos-shak- 
ing truth that people don’t think 
realistically, but in terms of desires 




SNARING THE HUMAN MIND 

and symbols. In other words, if you 
want to influence other people, you 
work through the subconscious. 
This obviously holds true today. For 
example, a firm manufacturing 
men’s shirts and wanting to sell 
them, not to ordinary customers 
but to hard-headed retailers, de- 
cided on these rules: Don’t talk 
about shirts, don’t talk about prices; 
but show a pretty girl almost with- 
out one of the shirts you are trying 
to sell. 

Such seemingly obvious appeals 
to basic human urges are getting 
more subtle all the time, as trained 
psychologists and sociologists are 
lured into the selling game by far 
higher salaries than universities can 
pay. For instance, a Viennese psy- 
chiatrist has figured out for Chrys- 
ler that a man looks on a converti- 
ble as his mistress, but on a hard- 
topped sedan as his wife. So the 
psychiatrist advises car dealers to 
put a convertible in the front win- 
dow of the store, with a lot of more 
businesslike cars behind it. Men 
will come in to smell anxiously 
around the convertible, but they’ll 
buy the other model. 

Another psychoanalyst has been 
telling greeting card manufacturers 
just what shapes and forms to put 
on the pasteboard oblongs they sell. 
The shapes and forms, all very gay- 
ly colored and carefully general- 
ized, turn out to be the basic sym- 
bols of sex. 

Of course, part of this is just good 
old horse sense and another part is 
merely psychologists trying to sell 
industry an interesting bill of goods. 
But there is a solid reminder of ac- 
tivities pointing to an ever more 



53 

efficient gimmicking of the human 
brain. 

A LOT OF this gimmicking 
seems much too obvious to be 
effective, especially to the person 
who prides himself on being “ad- 
hardened.” This may be true for 
the conscious mind, but hardly for 
the subconscious. We laugh indul- 
gently at the childishness of an ad- 
vertiser who tries to make us buy 
a soft drink because it is pictured on 
the same billboard as an impossibly 
attractive and innocent-looking girl. 
Meanwhile we drink the same soft 
drink because, we tell ourselves, it 
is really more refreshing. 

The migration of psychologists 
into industry has been paralleled by 
other manifestations of a large-scale 
attempt to gimmick the human 
brain : the growing resemblance be- 
tween articles and advertising in 
magazines and newspapers ; the ten- 
dency to expect authorities — or 
perhaps, ultimately, robot brains — 
to settle all questions; careful cen- 
soring in advance of each item that 
goes into the mass media of com- 
munication; increasing distrust by 
authorities of the ability of ordinary 
people to weigh any general prob- 
lem intelligently. 

Meanwhile, our old friend hyp- 
notism is being made into a more 
potent weapon. For a long time 
many psychologists believed that a 
hypnotized person could not be 
made to perform an act contrary to 
his moral code. Yet recent experi- 
ments show that a hypnotized per- 
son will attempt a murderous attack 
on an innocent bystander — if first

“I’m up here, Trina .” 

She looked up then and saw him, 
hovering some thirty feet off the 
ground in the ridiculous windmill- 
like craft he and his people used 
when they visited the world. 

“Oh, hello, Max.” No wonder 
she had known the voice. Max 
Cramer, down from space, down to 
the world, to see her. She knew, 
even before he dropped his craft 
onto the grass beside her, that he 
had come to see her. He couldn’t 
have been on the world for more 
than the hour she’d been riding. 

“You’re visiting us early this year, 
Max. It’s not festival time for three 
months yet.” 

“I know.” He cut the power to 
the windmill blades, and they 
slowed, becoming sharply visible. 
The horse snorted and backed 
away. Max smiled. “This world is 
very — attractive.” 

His eyes caught hers, held them. 
She smiled back, wishing for the 
hundredth time since last summer’s 
festival that he were one of her 
people, or at least a worldling, and 
not a man with the too white skin 
of space. 

“It may be attractive,” she said. 
“But you always leave it soon 
enough.” 

He nodded. “It’s too confining. 
It’s all right, for a little while, but 
then...” 

“How can you say that?” She 
shook her head sadly. Already they 
were arguing the same old unre- 
solvable argument, and they had 
scarcely greeted each other. After 
all his months in space they met 
with the same words as they had 
parted. She looked past him, up and 
out, toward the horizon that seemed 



so many miles away, toward the 
morning sun that seemed to hang 
far, far off in the vaulted blue dome 
of the sky. 

“How can you even think it? 
About this?” 

His lips tightened. “About this ” 
he repeated. “A horizon you could 
ride to in five minutes. A world you 
could ride around in two hours. A 
sun — you really call it a sun — that 
you could almost reach up and 
pluck out of that sky of yours.” He 
laughed. “Illusions. World of il- 
lusions.” 

“Well, what do you have? A ship 
— a tiny ship you can’t get out of, 
with walls you can see, all around 
you.” 

“Yes, Trina, with walls we can 
see.” 

He was still smiling, watching 
her, and she knew that he desired 
her. And she desired him. But not 
the stars. 

“You have nothing like this,” she 
said, knowing it wouldn’t do any 
good. She looked past him at the 
light tower, one of the many that 
formed the protective screen about 
her world, that made it seem great 
and convex, a huge flattened sphere 
with the sun high above, and not 
the swift curving steel ball that it 
actually was. 

This was her world. It was like 
Earth, like the old Earth of the 
legends of the time before the ra- 
diation wars. And even though her 
mind might know the truth about 
the screens that refracted light and 
the atomic pile that was her sun, 
her heart knew a more human 
truth. This was a world. As it had 
been in the beginning. As it must 
be till the end — or until they found 




THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING 



57 



a new Earth, somewhere, some- 
time . 

Max sighed. “Yes, you have your 
world, Trina. And it’s a good one — 
the best of its kind I’ve ever vis- 
ited.” 

“Why don’t you stay here then?” 
A spaceman, she thought. With 
all the dozens of men in my world, 
why did it have to be a spaceman? 
With all the visitors from New 
France and New Chile and New 
Australia last festival, why did it 
have to be him? 

“I have the stars, Trina.” 

“We do too!” Last festival, and 
the warm June night, heavy, drug- 
gedly heavy with honeysuckle and 
magnolia, and the hidden music 
from the pavillions. And Max 
Cramer, tall and strong boned and 
alien, holding her in his arms, danc- 
ing her away from her people, out 
onto the terrace above the little 
stream, beneath the full festival 
moon and the summer stars, the 
safe, sane, well ordered constella- 
tions that their ancestors had looked 
upon from Earth. 

“My stars are real, Trina.” 

She shook her head, unable to 
argue with him. World-woman and 
space-man, and always different, 
with nothing in common between 
them, really, except a brief forget- 
fulness at festival time. 

“Come with me, Trina.” 

“No.” She gathered up the reins 
and chucked at the horse and 
turned, slowly, for the village. 
“You wouldn’t come — for me?” 
“You wouldn’t stay, would you?” 
She heard the windmill blades 
whir again, and a rustling of wind, 
and then he was beside her, skim- 
ming slowly along, barely off the 



ground, making her horse snort 
nervously away. 

“Trina, I shouldn’t tell you this, 
not until we’ve met with your 
councilmen. But I — I’ve got to.” 

He wasn’t smiling now. There 
was a wild look about his face. She 
didn’t like it. 

“Captain Bernard’s with the 
council now, giving them the news. 
But I wanted to see you first, to be 
the one who told you.” He broke 
off, shook his head. “Yet when I 
found you I couldn’t say anything. 
I guess I was afraid of what you’d 
answer. .” 

“What are you talking about?” 
She didn’t want to look at him. It 
embarrassed her somehow, seeing 
him so eager. “What do you want 
to tell me?” 

“About our last trip, Trina. 
We’ve found a world!” 

She stared at him blankly, and 
his hand made a cutting gesture of 
impatience. “Oh, not a world like 
this one! A planet, Trina. And it’s 
Earth type!” 

She wheeled the horse about and 
stared at him. For a moment she 
felt excitement rise inside of her 
too, and then she remembered the 
generations of searching, and the 
false alarms, and the dozens of bar- 
ren, unfit planets that the space- 
men colonized, planets like ground- 
bound ships. 

“Oh, Trina,” Max cried, “This 
isn’t like the others. It’s a new 
Earth. And there are already peo- 
ple there. From not long after the 
Exodus. .” 

“A new Earth?” she said. “I 
don’t believe it.” 

The council wouldn’t either, she 
thought. Not after all the other 




58 



MARI WOLF 



new Earths, freezing cold or meth- 
ane atmosphered or at best com- 
pletely waterless. This would be 
like the others. A spaceman’s 
dream. 

“You’ve got to believe me, 
Trina,” Max said. “And you’ve got 
to help make the others believe. 
Don’t you see? You wouldn’t live 
in space. I wouldn’t live here — on 
this. But there, on a real planet, on 
a real Earth. 

Then suddenly she felt his ex- 
citement and it was a part of her, 
until against all reason she wanted 
to believe in his mad dream of a 
world. She laughed aloud as she 
caught up the reins and raced her 
horse homeward, toward the long 
vista of the horizon and the capital 
village beyond it, ten minutes gal- 
lop away. 

AX AND TRINA came to- 
gether into the council hall 
and saw the two groups, the room- 
ful of worldmen and the half dozen 
spacemen, apart from each other, 
arguing. The spacemen’s eyes were 
angry. 

“A world,” Captain Bernard 
said bitterly, “there for your tak- 
ing, and you don’t even want to 
look at it.” 

“How do we know what kind of 
world it is?” Councilman Elias 
leaned forward on the divan. His 
voice was gentle, almost pitying. 
“You brought no samples. No vege- 
tation, no minerals. 

“Not even air samples,” Aaron 
Gomez said softly. “Why?” 

Bernard sighed. “We didn’t want 
to wait,” he said. “We wanted to 
get back here* to tell you.” 



“It may be a. paradise world to 
you ” Elias said. “But to us. 

Max Cramer tightened his grip 
on Trina’s hand. “The fools,” he 
said. “Talking and talking, and all 
the time this world drifts farther 
and farther away.” 

“It takes so much power to 
change course,” Trina said. “And 
besides, you feel it. It makes you 
heavy.” 

She remembered the stories her 
father used to tell, about his own 
youth, when he and Curt Elias had 
turned the world to go to a planet 
the spaceman found. A planet with 
people — people who lived under 
glass domes, or deep below the 
formaldehyde poisoned surface. 

“You could be there in two 
weeks, easily, even at your world’s 
speed,” Captain Bernard said. 

“And then we’d have to go out,” 
Elias said. “Into space.” 

The worldmen nodded. The 
women looked at each other and 
nodded too. One of the spacemen 
swore, graphically, and there was 
an embarrassed silence as Trina’s 
people pretended not to have 
heard. 

“Oh, let’s get out of here.” The 
spaceman who had sworn swore 
again, just as descriptively, and 
then grinned at the councilmen 
and their aloof, blank faces. “They 
don’t want our planet. All right. 
Maybe New Chile. .” 

“Wait!” Trina said it without 
thinking, without intending to. She 
stood speechless when the others 
turned to face her. All the others. 
Her people and Max’s. Curt Elias, 
leaning forward again, smiling at 
her. 

“Yes, Trina?” the councilman 





THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

said. 

“Why don’t we at least look at 
it? Maybe it is — what they say.” 

Expression came back to their 
faces then. They nodded at each 
other and looked from her to Max 
Cramer and back agahTat her, and 
they smiled. Festival^ time, their 
eyes said. Summer evenings, sum- 
mer foolishness. 

And festival time long behind 
them, but soon to come again. 

“Your father went to space,” 
Elias said. “We saw one of those 
worlds the spacemen talk of.” 

“I know.” 

“He didn’t like it.” 

“I know that too,” she said, re- 
membering his bitter words and the 
nightmare times when her mother 
had had so much trouble comfort- 
ing him, and the winter evenings 
when he didn’t want even to go 
outside and see the familiar, Earth 
encircling stars. 

He was dead now. Her mother 
was dead now. They were not here, 
to disapprove, to join with Elias 
and the others. 

They would have hated for her 
to go out there. 

She faltered, the excitement 
Max had aroused in her dying 
away, and then she thought of their 
argument, as old as their desire. 
She knew that if she wanted him it 
would have to be away from the 
worlds. 

“At least we could look,” she 
said. “And the spacemen could 
bring up samples. And maybe even 
some of the people for us to talk 
to.” 

Elias nodded. “It would be inter- 
esting,” he said slowly, “to talk to 
some new people. It’s been so 



long.” 

“And we wouldn’t even have to 
land,” Aaron Gomez said, “if it 
didn’t look right.” 

The people turned to each other 
again and smiled happily. She 
knew that they were thinking of 
the men and women they would 
see, and all the new things to talk 
about. 

“We might even invite some of 
them up for the festival,” Elias said 
slowly. “Providing they’re — cour- 
teous.” He frowned at the young 
spaceman who had done the 
swearing, and then he looked back 
at Captain Bernard. “And provid- 
ing, of course, that we’re not too far 
away by then.” 

“I don’t think you will be,” Ber- 
nard said. “I think you’ll stay.” 

“I think so too,” Max Cramer 
said, moving closer to Trina. “I 
hope so.” 

Elias stood up slowly and sig- 
nalled that the council was dis- 
missed. The other people stood up 
also and moved toward the doors. 

“We’d better see about chang- 
ing the world’s course,” Aaron 
Gomez said. 

No one objected. It was going to 
be done. Trina looked up at Max 
Cramer and knew that she loved 
him. And wondered why she was 
afraid. 



I T WAS TEN days later that 
the world, New America, came 
into the gravitational influence of 
the planet’s solar system. The auto- 
matic deflectors swung into func- 
tioning position, ready to change 
course, slowly and imperceptibly, 
but enough to take the world 




60 



MARI WOLF 



around the system and out into the 
freedom of space where it could 
wander on its random course. But 
this time men shunted aside the 
automatic controls. Men guided 
their homeland in, slowly now, to- 
ward the second planet from the 
sun, the one that the spacemen had 
said was so like Earth. 

“We’ll see it tomorrow,” Trina 
said. “They’ll shut off part of the 
light tower system then.” 

“Why don’t they now?” Max 
Cramer asked her. It was just past 
sunset, and the stars of a dozen gen- 
erations ago were just beginning 
to wink into view. He saw Venus, 
low on the horizon, and his lips 
tightened, and then he looked up 
to where he knew the new sun must 
be. 

There was only the crescent of 
Earth’s moon. 

“Now?” Trina said. “Why should 
they turn the screens off now? 
We’re still so far away. We 
wouldn’t see anything.” 

“You’d see the sun,” Max said. 
“It’s quite bright, even from here. 
And from close up, from where the 
planet is, it looks just about like 
Earth’s.” 

Trina nodded. “That’s good,” 
she said, looking over at the rose 
tints of the afterglow. “It wouldn’t 
seem right if it didn’t.” 

A cow lowed in the distance, and 
nearer, the laughing voices of chil- 
dren rode the evening breeze. 
Somewhere a dog barked. Some- 
where else a woman called her fam- 
ily home to supper. Old sounds. 
Older, literally, than this world. 

“What are the people like, out 
there?” 

He looked at her face, eager and 



worried at the same time, and he 
smiled. “You’ll like them, Trina,” 
he said. “They’re like — well, they’re 
more like this than anything else.” 

He gestured, vaguely, at the 
farmhouse lights ahead of them, at 
the slow walking figures of the 
young couples out enjoying the 
warm spring evening, at the old 
farmer leading his plow horse home 
along the path. 

“They live in villages, not too 
different from yours. And in cities. 
And on farms.” 

“And yet, you like it there, don’t 
you?” she said. 

He nodded. “Yes, I like it there.” 

“But you don’t like it here. 
Why?” 

“If you don’t understand by 
now, Trina, I can’t explain.” 

They walked on. Night came 
swiftly, crowding the rose and pur- 
ple tints out of the western sky, 
closing in dark and cool and sweet 
smelling about them. Ahead, a 
footbridge loomed up out of the 
shadows. There was the sound of 
running water, and, on the bank 
not far from the bridge, the low 
murmuring of a couple of late lin- 
gering fishermen. 

“The people live out in the open, 
like this?” Trina said. 

“Yes.” 

“Not underground?” Not under 
a dome?” 

“I’ve told you before that it’s like 
Earth, Trina. About the same size, 
even.” 

“This is about the same size, 
too.” 

“Not really. It only looks that 
way.” 

The fishermen glanced up as 
they passed, and then bent down 




THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING 



61 



over their lines again. Lucas Cross- 
man, from Trina’s town, and Jake 
Krakorian from the southern hemi- 
sphere, up to visit his sister Lu- 
cienne, who had just had twins. 

Trina said hello to them as she 
passed, and found out that the 
twins looked just like their mother, 
except for Grandfather Mueller’s 
eyes, and then she turned back to 
Max. 

“Do people live all over the 
planet?” 

“On most of it. The land sec- 
tions, that is. Of course, up by the 
poles it’s too cold.” 

“But how do they know each 
other?” 

He stopped walking and stared 
at her, not understanding for a 
minute. Girl’s laughter came from 
the bushes, and the soft urging 
voice of one of the village boys. 
Max looked back at the fishermen 
and then down at Trina and shook 
his head. 

“They don’t all know each 
other,” he said. “They couldn’t.” 

She thought of New Chile, where 
her cousin Isobelle was married 
last year, and New India, which 
would follow them soon to the 
planet, because Captain Bernard 
had been able to contact them by 
radio. She thought of her people, 
her friends, and then she remem- 
bered the spacemen’s far flung 
ships and the homes they burrowed 
deep in the rock of inhospitable 
worlds. She knew that he would 
never understand why she pitied 
the people of this system. 

“I suppose we’ll see them soon,” 
she said. “You’re going to bring 
some of them back up in your ship 
tomorrow, aren’t you?” 



He stood quietly, looking down 
at her. His face was shadowed in 
the gathering night and his whole 
body was in shadow, tall and some- 
how alien seeming there before her. 

“Why wait for them to come 
here, Trina?” he said. “Come 
down with us, in the ship, tomor- 
row. Come down and see for your- 
self what it’s like.” 

She trembled. “No,” she said. 

And she thought of the ship, out 
away from the sky, not down on 
the planet yet but hanging above it, 
with no atmosphere to break the 
blackness, to soften the glare of the 
planet’s sun, to shut out the empti- 
ness. 

“You’d hardly know you weren’t 
here, Trina. The air smells the 
same. And the weight’s almost the 
same too. Maybe a little lighter.” 

She nodded. “I know. If we land 
the world, I’ll go out there. But not 
in the ship.” 

“All right.” He sighed and let 
go his grip on her shoulders and 
turned to start walking back the 
way they had come, toward the 
town. 

She thought suddenly of what he 
had just said, that she would hard- 
ly be able to tell the difference. 

“It can’t be so much like this,” 
she said. “Or you couldn’t like it. 
No matter what you say.” 

“Trina.” His voice was harsh. 
“You’ve never been out in space, so 
you couldn’t understand. You just 
don’t know what your world is like, 
from outside, when you’re coming 
in.” 

But she could picture it. A tiny 
planetoid, shining perhaps behind 
its own screens, a small, drifting, 
lonely sphere of rock. She trembled 




62

again. “I don’t want to know,” she 
said. 

Somewhere in the meadows be- 
yond the road there was laughter, 
a boy and a girl laughing together, 
happy in the night. Trina’s fingers 
tightened on Max’s hand and she 
pulled him around to face her and 
then clung to him, trembling, feel- 
ing the nearness of him as she held 
up her face to be kissed. 

He held her to him. And slowly, 
the outside world of space faded, 
and her world seemed big and solid 
and sure, and in his arms it was 
almost like festival time again. 



A T NOON the next day the 
world slowed again and 
changed course, going into an orbit 
around the planet, becoming a 
third moon, nearer to the surface 
than the others. 

The people, all. of those who had 
followed their normal day-to-day 
life even after New America came 
into the system, abandoned it at 
last. They crowded near the tele- 
vision towers, waiting for the sig- 
nal which would open up some of 
the sky and show them the planet 
they circled, a great green disk, 
twice the apparent diameter of the 
legendary Moon of Earth. 

Max stood beside Trina in the 
crowd that pressed close about his 
ship. He wore his spaceman’s suit, 
and the helmet was in his hand. 
Soon he too would be aboard with 
the others, going down to the 
planet. 

“You’re sure you won’t come, 
Trina? We’ll be down in a couple 
of hours.” 

“I’ll wait until we land there. If 



we do.” 

Curt Elias came toward them 
through the crowd. When he saw 
Trina he smiled and walked faster, 
almost briskly. It was strange to see 
him move like a young and active 
man. 

“If I were younger,” he said, 
“I’d go down there.” He smiled 
again and pointed up at the zenith, 
where the blue was beginning to 
waver and fade as the sky screens 
slipped away. “This brings back 
memories.” 

“You didn’t like that other 
world,” Trina said. “Not any more 
than Father did.” 

“The air was bad there,” Elias 
said. 

The signal buzzer sounded again. 
The center screens came down. 
Above them, outlined by the fuzzy 
halo of the still remaining sky, the 
black of space stood forth, and the 
stars, and the great disk of the 
planet, with its seas and continents 
and cloud masses and the shadow 
of night creeping across it from the 
east. 

“You see, Trina?” Max said 
softly. 

The voices of the people rose, 
some alive with interest and others 
anxious, fighting back the planet 
and the unfamiliar, too bright stars. 
Trina clutched Max Cramer’s 
hand, feeling again the eagerness 
of that first day, when he had come 
to tell her of this world. 

“You’re right,” she whispered. 
“It is like Earth.” 

It was so much like the pictures, 
though of course the continents 
were different, and the seas, and 
instead of one moon there were 
two. Earth. A new Earth, there 




THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING 



63 



above them in the sky. 

Elias let out his breath slowly. 
“Yes,” he said. “It is. It’s not a bit 
like that world we visited. Not a 
bit.” 

“When you’re down there it’s 
even more like Earth,” Max said. 
“And all the way down you could 
watch it grow larger. It wouldn’t 
be at all like open space.” 

At the poles of the planet snow 
gleamed, and cloud masses drifted 
across the equator. And the people 
looked, and pointed, their voices 
growing loud with eagerness. 

“Why don’t we land the world 
now?” Trina cried. “Why wait for 
the ship to bring people up here?” 

“Landing the world would take 
a lot of power,” Elias said. “It 
would be foolish to do it unless we 
planned on staying for quite a 
while.” He sighed. “Though I 
would like to go down there. I’d 
like to see a really Earth type 
planet.” 

He looked at Max, and Max 
smiled. “Well, why not?” he said. 

Elias smiled too. “After all, I’ve 
been in space once. I’ll go again.” 
He turned and pushed his way 
through the people. 

Trina watched him go. Some- 
how he seemed a symbol to her. 
Old and stable, he had been head 
of the council since she was a 
child. And he had gone into space 
with her father. 

“Please come, Trina,” Max said. 
“There’s nothing to be afraid of.” 

With both Max and Elias along, 
certainly it couldn’t be too bad. 
Max was right. There was nothing, 
really, to be afraid of. She smiled 
up at him. 

“All right,” she said. “I’ll go.” 



And then she was walking with 
Max Cramer toward the ship and 
trying not to remember her father 
crying in his sleep. 

HE SHIP rose, and Trina cried 
out as she felt the heaviness 
wrench her back against the cush- 
ions. Max reached over to her. 
She felt the needle go into her arm 
again, and then sank back into the 
half sleep that he had promised 
would last until they were ready to 
land. 

When she awoke the planet was 
a disk no longer, but a great curv- 
ing mass beneath the ship, with the 
mountains and valleys and towns 
of its people plainly visible. But the 
planet’s sky still lay below, and 
around them, in every direction 
except down, space stretched out, 
blacker than any night on the 
world. The world. Trina moaned 
and closed her eyes, glad she hadn’t 
seen it, somewhere tiny and insig- 
nificant behind them. 

Max heard her moan and 
reached toward her. She slept 
again, and woke only when they 
were down and he was tugging the 
straps loose from around her. She 
sat up, still numbed by the drug, 
still half asleep and unreal feeling, 
and looked out about her at the 
planet’s surface. 

They were in a field of some sort 
of grain. Beyond the scorched land 
where they had come down the tall 
cereal grasses rippled in the soft 
wind, a great undulating sea of 
green, reaching out toward the far 
off hills and the horizon. Cloud 
shadows drifted across the fields, 
and the shadow of the ship reached 





64 



MARI WOLF 



out to meet them. 

Trina rubbed her eyes in wonder. 

“It is like the world/’ she said. 
“Just like it.” 

For a moment she was sure that 
they were back on the world again, 
in some momentarily unrecognized 
pasture, or perhaps on one of the 
sister worlds. Then, looking along 
the row of hills to where they 
dropped away into an extension of 
the plain, she saw that the horizon 
was a little too far, and that the 
light shimmered differently, some- 
how, than on her home. But it was 
such a little difference. 

“Come on outside,” Max Cramer 
said. “You’ll be all right now.” 

She stood up and followed him. 
Elias was already at the airlock, 
moving unsteadily and a little 
blankly, also still partly under the 
influence of the narcotic. 

The lock opened. Captain Ber- 
nard stepped out and went down 
the ladder to the ground. The oth- 
ers followed him. Within a few 
minutes the ship stood empty. 



T RINA breathed the open air 
of the planet and felt the 
warmth on her face and smelled 
the scent of grass and the elusive 
fragrance of alien flowers. She 
heard the song of some strange, 
infinitely sweet throated bird. 

“It’s — it’s Earth,” she whispered. 
Voices, eager, calling voices, 
sang out in the distance. Then, lit- 
tle cars rolled toward them through 
the field, mowing down the grass, 
cutting themselves a path to the 
ship. People, men and women and 
children, were calling greetings. 
“This is where we landed be- 



fore,” Max said. “We told them 
we’d be back.” 

They were sunbronzed, country 
people, and except for their strange 
clothing they might have been from 
any of the worlds. Even their lan- 
guage was the same, though ac- 
cented differently, with some of the 
old, unused words, like those in the 
legends. 

“You’ve brought your people?” 
the tall man who stood in the fore- 
front said to Captain Bernard. 

“They’re up there.” Bernard 
pointed up at the sky, and the peo- 
ple looked up. Trina looked up too. 
One of the planet’s moons was al- 
most full overhead. But the world 
was invisible, shut off by the sky 
and the clouds and the light of the 
earthlike sun. 

“They’d like some of you to come 
visit their world,” Bernard said. “If 
any of you are willing.” 

The tall man nodded. “Everyone 
will want to go,” he said. “Very 
few ships ever land here. Until you 
came, it had been years.” 

“You’d go out in space?” Trina 
said incredulously. 

Again the man nodded. “I was a 
spaceman once,” he said. “All of 
us MacGregors were.” Then he 
sighed. “Sometimes even now I 
want to go out again. But there’ve 
been no ships here, not for years.” 

Trina looked past him, at the 
women and the children, at the 
lush fields and the little houses far 
in the distance. “You’d leave this?” 

MacGregor shook his head. “No, 
of course not. Not to live in space 
permanently. I’d always come 
back.” 

“It’s a fine world to come back 




THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING 



65 



to,” Max said, and he and the tall 
man smiled at each other, as if 
they shared something that Trina 
couldn’t possibly understand. 

“We might as well go into town,” 
MacGregor said. 

They walked over to the cars. 
MacGregor stopped beside one of 
them, his hand on the door button. 

“Here, let me drive.” The girl 
stepped forward out of the crowd 
as she spoke. She was tall, almost as 
tall as MacGregor, and she had 
the same high cheekbones and the 
same laughter lines about her eyes. 

“Not this time, Saari,” Mac- 
Gregor said. “This time you can 
entertain our guests.” He turned to 
Max and Trina and smiled. “My 
daughter.” His face was proud. 

They climbed in, Trina wedging 
herself into the middle of the back 
seat between Max and the planet 
girl. The car throbbed into motion, 
then picked up speed, jolting a bit 
on the rough country road. The 
ground rushed past and the fields 
rushed past and Trina leaned 
against Max and shut her eyes 
against the dizzying speed. Here, 
close to the ground, so close that 
they could feel every unevenness of 
its surface, it was far worse than in 
the windmill like craft the space- 
men used on the worlds. 

“Don’t you have cars?” Saari 
asked 

“No,” Trina said. “We don’t 
need them.” 

A car like this would rush all the 
way around the world in half an 
hour. In a car like this one even 
the horizons wouldn’t look right, 
rushing to meet them. Here, though 
the horizons stayed the same, un- 
moving while the fence posts and 



the farmhouses and the people 
flashed past. 

“What do you use for transpor- 
tation then?” 

“We walk,” Trina said, opening 
her eyes to look at the girl and then 
closing them again. “Or we ride 
horses.” 

“Oh.” 

A few minutes later the car 
slowed, and Trina opened her eyes 
again. 

“We’re coming into town,” 
Saari said. 

They had climbed up over the 
brow of a small hill and were now 
dropping down. At the bottom of 
the hill the houses clumped to- 
gether, sparsely at first, then more 
and more of them, so that the 
whole valley was filled with build- 
ings, and more buildings hugged 
the far slopes. 

“There are so many of them,” 
Trina whispered. 

“Oh, no, Trina. This is just a 
small town.” 

“But the people — all those peo- 
ple. .” 

They crowded the streets, watch- 
ing the cars come in, looking with 
open curiosity at their alien visitors. 
Faces, a thousand faces, all differ- 
ent and yet somehow all alike, 
blended together into a great 
anonymous mass. 

“There aren’t half that many 
people on the whole world,” Trina 
said. 

Saari smiled. “Just wait till you 
see the city.” 

Trina shook her head and looked 
up at Max. He was smiling out at 
the town, nodding to some men he 
apparently knew, with nothing but 
eagerness in his face. He seemed a 




66 



MARI WOLF 



stranger. She looked around for 
Curt Elias, but he was in one of the 
other cars cut off from them by the 
crowd. She couldn’t see him at all. 

“Don’t you like it?” Saari said. 

“I liked it better where we 
landed.” 

Max turned and glanced down 
at her briefly, but his hand found 
hers and held it, tightly, until her 
own relaxed. “If you want to, 
Trina, we can live out there, in 
those fields.” 

For a moment she forgot the 
crowd and the endless faces as she 
looked up at him. “Do you mean 
that, Max? We could really live out 
there?” 

Where it was quiet, and the sun 
was the same, and the birds sang 
sweetly just before harvest time, 
where she would have room to ride 
and plenty of pasture for her favor- 
ite horse. Where she would have 
Max, there with her, not out some- 
where beyond the stars. 

“Certainly we could live there,” 
he said. “That’s what I’ve been 
saying all along.” 

“You could settle down here?” 

He laughed. “Oh, I suppose I’d 
be out in space a good deal of the 
time,” he said. “The ships will 
come here now, you know. But I’ll 
always come home, Trina. To this 
world. To you.” 

And suddenly it didn’t matter 
that the girl beside her chuckled, 
nor that there were too many peo- 
ple crowding around them, all talk- 
ing at once in their strangely ac- 
cented voices. All that mattered 
was Max, and this world, which 
was real after all. and a life that 
seemed like an endless festival time 
before her. 



E VENING came quickly, too 
quickly, with the sun dropping 
in an unnatural plunge toward the 
horizon. Shadows crept out from 
the houses of the town, reached 
across the narrow street and 
blended with the walls of the 
houses opposite. The birds sang 
louder in the twilight, the notes of 
their song drifting in from the near- 
by fields. And there was another 
sound, that of the wind, not loud 
now but rising, swirling fingers of 
dust in the street. 

Trina sat in front of the town 
cafe with the planet girl, Saari. 
Max Cramer was only a few feet 
away, but he paid no attention to 
her, and little to Elias. He was too 
busy telling the planet people about 
space. 

“Your man?” Saari asked. 

“Yes,” Trina said. “I guess so.” 
“You’re lucky.” Saari looked over 
at Max and sighed, and then she 
turned back to Trina. “My father 
was a spaceman. He used to take 
my mother up, when they were first 
married, when the ships were still 
running.” She sighed. “I remember 
the ships, a little. But it was such a 
long time ago.” 

“I can’t understand you peo- 
ple.” Trina shook her head. “Leav- 
ing all of this, just to go out in 
space.” 

The room was crowded, oppres- 
sively crowded. Outside, too many 
people walked the shadowed streets. 
Too many voices babbled together. 
The people of this planet must be 
a little mad, Trina thought, to live 
cooped together as the spacemen 
lived, with all their world around 
them. 

Saari sat watching her, and 




THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

nodded. “You’re different, aren’t 
you? From us, and from them too.” 
She looked over at Max and Ber- 
nard and the others, and then she 
looked at Curt Elias, who sat 
clenching and unclenching his 
hands, saying nothing. 

“Yes, we’re different,” Trina 
said. 

Klax Cramer’s voice broke in- 
cisively into the silence that lay be- 
tween them then. “I don’t see 
why,” he said, “we didn’t all know 
about this world. Especially if more 
than one ship came here.” 

Saari’s father laughed softly. “It’s 
not so strange. The ships all be- 
longed to one clan. The Mac- 
Gregors. And eventually all of them 
either were lost in space somewhere 
or else grew tired of roaming 
around and settled down. Here.” 
He smiled again, and his high 
cheekboned face leaned forward 
into the light. “Like me. 

Night. Cloudless, black, but 
hazed over with atmosphere and 
thus familiar, not like the night of 
space. The two small moons, the 
stars in unfamiliar places, and 
somewhere, a star that was her 
world. And Trina sat and listened 
to the planet men talk, and to the 
spacemen among them who could 
no longer be distinguished from 
the native born. Outside, in the 
narrow street, wind murmured, 
skudding papers and brush before 
it, vague shadows against the light 
houses. Wind, rising and moaning, 
the sound coming in over the voices 
and the music from the cafe 
singers. 

It was a stronger wind than ever 
blew on the world, even during the 
winter, when the people had to stay 



inside and wish that Earth tradi- 
tion might be broken and good 
weather be had the year around. 

“We’d better get back to the 
ship,” Elias said. 

They stopped talking and looked 
at him, and he looked down at his 
hands, embarrassed. “They’ll be 
worried about us at home.” 

“No, they won’t,” Max said. 
Then he saw the thin, blue-veined 
hands trembling and the quiver not 
quite controlled in the wrinkled 
neck. “Though perhaps we should 
start back. 

Trina let out her breath in relief. 
To be back in the ship, she thought, 
with the needle and its forgetful- 
ness, away from the noise and the 
crowd and the nervousness brought 
on by the rising wind. 

It would be better, of course, 
when they had their place in the 
country. There it would be warm 
and homelike and quiet, with the 
farm animals near by, and the 
weather shut out, boarded out and 
forgotten, the way it was in winter 
on the world. 

“You’re coming with us?” Cap- 
tain Bernard was saying. 

“Yes, we’re coming.” Half a 
dozen of the men stood up and be- 
gan pulling on their long, awkward 
coats. 

“It’ll be good to get back in space 
again,” MacGregor said. “For a 
while.” He smiled. “But I’m too old 
for a spaceman’s life now.” 

“And I’m too old even for this,” 
Elias said apologetically. “If we’d 
found this planet the other time. 
He sighed and shook his head and 
looked out the window at the shad- 
ows that were people, bent for- 
ward, walking into the wind. He

sighed again. “I don’t know. I just 
don’t know.” 

Saari got up and pulled on her 
wrap too. Then she walked over to 
one of the other women, spoke to 
her a minute, and came back carry- 
ing a quilted, rough fabricked coat. 
“Here, Trina, you’d better put this 
on. It’ll be cold out.” 

“Are you going with us?” 

“Sure. Why not? Dad’s talked 
enough about space. I might as well 
see what it’s like for myself.” 

Trina shook her head. But be- 
fore she could speak, someone 
opened the door and the cold 
breeze came in, hitting her in the 
face 

“Come on,” Saari said. “It’ll be 
warm in the car.” 

Somehow she was outside, fol- 
lowing the others. The wind 
whipped her hair, stung her eyes, 
tore at her legs. The coat kept it 
from her body, but she couldn’t 
protect her face, nor shut out the 
low moaning wail of it through the 
trees and the housetops. 

She groped her way into the car. 
The door slammed shut, and the 
wind retreated, a little. 

“Is it — is it often like that?” 
Saari MacGregor looked at her. 
Max Cramer turned and looked at 
her, and so did the others in the 
car. For a long moment no one 
said anything. And then Saari said, 
“Why, this is summer , Trina.” 
“Summer?” She thought of the 
cereal grasses, rippling in the warm 
day. They’d be whipping in the 
wind now, of course. The wind that 
was so much stronger than any the 
world’s machines ever made. 

“You ought to be here in win- 
ter,” Saari was saying. “It really 



blows then. And there are the rain- 
storms, and snow. .” 

“Snow?” Trina said blankly. 

“Certainly. A couple of feet of 
it, usually.” Saari stopped talking 
and looked at Trina, and surprise 
crept even farther into her face. 
“You mean you don’t have snow 
on your world?” 

“Why, yes, we have snow. We 
have everything Earth had.” But 
snow two feet deep. Trina shiv- 
ered, thinking of winter on the 
world, and the soft dusting of white 
on winter mornings, the beautiful 
powdery flakes cool in the sunlight. 

“They have about a sixteenth of 
an inch of it,” Max said. “And 
even that’s more than some of the 
worlds have. It hardly ever even 
rains in New California.” 

Saari turned away finally, and 
the others did too. The car started, 
the sound of its motors shutting out 
the wind a little, and then they 
were moving. Yet it was even more 
frightening, rushing over the roads 
in the darkness, with the houses 
flashing past and the trees thrash- 
ing in the wind and the people 
briefly seen and then left behind in 
the night. 

The ship was ahead. The ship. 
Now even it seemed a safe, familiar 
place. 

“This isn’t like Earth after all,” 
Trina said bitterly. “And it seemed 
so beautiful at first.” 

Then she saw that Saari Mac- 
Gregor was looking at her again, 
but this time more in pity than in 
surprise. 

“Not like Earth, Trina? You’re 
wrong. We have a better climate 
than Earth’s. We never have bliz- 
zards, nor hurricanes, and it’s never 




THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING 



69 



too cold nor too hot, really.” 

“How can you say that?” Trina 
cried. “We’ve kept our world like 
Earth. Oh, maybe we’ve shortened 
winter a little, but still. .” 

Saari’s voice was sad and gentle, 
as if she were explaining something 
to a bewildered child. “My moth- 
er’s ancestors came here only a few 
years out from Earth,” she said. 
“And do you know what they called 
this planet? A paradise. A garden 
world.” 

“That’s why they named it 
Eden,” Max Cramer said. 

Then they were at the ship, out 
of the car, running to the airlock, 
with the grass lashing at their legs 
and the wind lashing at their faces 
and the cold night air aflame sud- 
denly in their lungs. And Trina 
couldn’t protest any longer, not 
with the world mad about her, not 
with Saari’s words ringing in her 
ears like the wind. 

She saw them carry Curt Elias 
in, and then Max was helping her 
aboard, and a moment later, final- 
ly, the airlock doors slipped shut 
and it was quiet. 

She held out her arm for the 
needle. 



W HEN SHE awoke again it 
was morning. Morning on 
the world. They had carried her to 
one of the divans in the council 
hall, one near a window so that she 
could see the familiar fields of her 
homeland as soon as she awoke. 
She rubbed her eyes and straight- 
ened and looked up at the others. 
At Elias, still resting on another 
divan. At Captain Bernard. At 
Saari and her father, and another 



man from the planet. At Max. 

He looked at her, and then 

sighed and turned away, shaking 
his head. 

“Are we — are we going back 
there?” Trina asked. 

“No,” Elias said. “The people 
are against it.” 

There was silence for a moment, 
and then Elias went on. “I’m 
against it. I suppose that even if I’d 
been young I wouldn’t have 

wanted to stay.” His eyes met 

Trina’s, and there was pity in them. 

“No,” Max said. “You wouldn’t 
have wanted to.” 

“And yet,” Elias said, “I went 
down there. Trina went down 

there. Her father and I both went 
out into space.” He sighed. “The 
others wouldn’t even do that.” 

“You’re not quite as bad, that’s 
all,” Max said bluntly. “But I don’t 
understand any of you. None of us 
ever has understood you. None of 
us ever will.” 

Trina looked across at him. Her 
fingers knew every line of his face, 
but now he was withdrawn, a 
stranger. “You’re going back there, 
aren’t you?” she said. And when he 
nodded, she sighed. “We’ll never 
understand you either, I guess.” 

She remembered Saari’s question 
of the night before, “Is he your 
man?” and she realized that her 
answer had not been the truth. She 
knew now that he had never been 
hers, not really, nor she his, that 
the woman who would be his would 
be like Saari, eager and unafraid 
and laughing in the wind, or look- 
ing out the ports at friendly stars. 

Elias leaned forward on the 
divan and gestured toward the 
master weather panel for their part

of the village, the indicators that 
told what it was like today and 
what it would be like tomorrow 
all over the world. “I think I un- 
derstand,” he said. “I think I know 
what we did to our environment, 
through the generations. But it 
doesn’t do much good, just know- 
ing something.” 

“You’ll never change,” Max said. 

“No, I don’t think we will.” 

Captain Bernard got up, and 
MacGregor got up too. They 
looked at Max. Slowly he turned 
his head and smiled at Trina, and 
then he tco stood up. “Want to 
come outside and talk, Trina?” 

But there was nothing to say. 
Nothing she could do except break 
down and cry in his arms and beg 
him not to leave her, beg him to 
spend the rest of his life on a world 
she could never leave again. 

“No,” she said. “I guess not.” 
And then, the memories rushed 
back, and the music, and the little 
lane down by the stream where the 
magnolias spread their web of fra- 
grance. It’s — it’s almost festival 
time, Max. Will you be here for 
it?” 

“I don’t know, Trina.” 

It meant no; she knew that. 

The weeks slipped by, until it 
was summer on the world, until 
the festival music sang through the 



villages and the festival flowers 
bloomed and the festival lovers 
slipped off from the dances to walk 
among them. There was a breeze, 
just enough to carry the mingled 
fragrances and the mingled songs, 
just enough to touch the throat and 
ruffle the hair and lie lightly be- 
tween the lips of lovers. 

Trina danced with Aaron Go- 
mez, and remembered. And the 
wind seemed too soft somehow, 
almost lifeless, with the air too 
sweet and cloying. 

She wondered what a festival on 
the planet would be like. 

Max, with Saari MacGregor, 
perhaps, laughing in the wind, run- 
ning in the chill of evening along 
some riverbank. 

I could have gone with him, she 
thought. I could have gone. 

But then the music swirled faster 
about them, the pulse of it pound- 
ing in her ears, and Aaron swept 
her closer as they danced, spinning 
among the people and the laughter, 
out toward the terrace, toward the 
trees with leaves unstirring in the 
evening air. All was color and 
sound and scent, all blended, hyp- 
notically perfect, something in- 
finitely precious that she could 
never, never leave. 

For it was summer on the world, 
and festival time again.

THE 

VALLEY

T HE SHIP dove into Earth’s 
sea of atmosphere like a greats 
silver fish. 

Inside the ship, a man and wom- 
an stood looking down at the ex- 
panse of land that curved away to 
a growing horizon. They saw the 
yellow ground cracked like a dried 
skin; and the polished stone of the 
mountains and the seas that were 
shrunken away in the dust. And 
they saw how the city circled the 
sea, as a circle of men surround a 
water hole in a desert under a blaz- 
ing sun. 

The ship’s radio cried out. 
“You’ve made it! Thank God! 
You’ve made it!” 

Another voice, shaking, said, 



“President — Davis is — over- 
whelmed. He can’t go on. On his 
behalf and on behalf of all the 
people — with our hope that was 
almost dead, we greet you.” A 
pause. “Please come in!” 

The voice was silent. The air 
screamed against the hull of the 
ship. 

“I can’t tell them,” said the man. 
“Please come in!” said the radio. 
“Do you hear me?” 

The woman looked up at the 
man. “You’ve got to Michael!” 
“Two thousand years. From one 
end of the galaxy to the other. Not 
one grain of dust we can live on. 
Just Earth. And it’s burned to a 
cinder.”

A note of hysteria stabbed into 
the radio voice. “Are you all right? 
Stand by! We’re sending a rescue 
ship.” 

“They’ve got a right to know 
what we’ve found,” said the wom- 
an. “They sent us out. They’ve 
waited so long — .” 

He stared into space. “It’s hope- 
less. If we’d found another planet 
they could live on, they’d do the 
same as they’ve done here.” 

He touched the tiny golden 
locket that hung around his neck. 
“Right now, I could press this and 
scratch myself and the whole farce 
would be over.” 

“No. A thousand of us died. 
You’ve got to think of them.” 

“We’ll go back out into space,” 
he said. “It’s clean out there. I’m 
tired. Two thousand years of rein- 
carnation.” 

She spoke softly. “We’ve been to- 
gether for a long time. I’ve loved 
you. I’ve asked very little. But I 
need to stay on Earth. Please, 
Michael.” 

He looked at her for a moment. 
Then he flipped a switch. “Milky 
Way to Earth. Never mind the 
rescue ship. We’re all right. We’re 
coming in.” 



T HE GREAT, white ship set- 
tled to Earth that was like a 
plain after flood waters have 
drained away. 

The man and woman came out 
into .the blazing sunlight. 

A shout, like the crashing of a 
thousand surfs, rose and broke over 
them. The man and woman de- 
scended the gang-plank toward the 
officials gathered on the platform. 



They glanced around at the massed 
field of white faces beneath them; 
saw those same faces that had been 
turned toward them two thousand 
years past; remembered the cheers 
and the cries that had crashed 
around them then, as they and the 
thousand had stood before the 
towering spires of the ships, before 
the takeoff. 

And, as then, there were no chil- 
dren among the milling, grasping 
throng. Only the same clutching 
hands and voices and arms, asking 
for an answer, a salvation, a happy 
end. 

Now the officials gathered 
around the man and the woman, 
and spoke to them in voices of 
reverence. 

A microphone was thrust into 
Michael’s hand with the whispered 
admonition to tell the people of the 
great new life waiting for them, 
open and green and moist, on a 
virgin planet. 

The cries of the people were slip- 
ping away and a stillness growing 
like an ocean calm and, within it, 
the sound of the pumps, throbbing, 
sucking the water from the seas. 

And then Michael’s voice, “The 
thousand who left with us are 
dead.” For some time we’ve known 
the other planets in our solar sys- 
tem were uninhabitable. Now 
we’ve been from one end of the 
galaxy to the other. And this is 
what we’ve found. We were 
given Earth. There’s no place else 
for us. The rest of the planets in 
the galaxy were given to others. 
There’s no place else for them. 
We’ve all had a chance to make 
the best of Earth. Instead we’ve 
made the worst of it. So we’re here 




74 



RICHARD STOCKHAM 



to stay — and die.” He handed the 
microphone back. 

The silence did not change. 

The President grasped Michael’s 
arm. “What’re you saying?” 

A buzzing rose up from the peo- 
ple like that of a swarm of fright- 
ened bees. The sea of white faces 
swayed and their voices began to 
cry. The din and motion held, long 
and drawn out, with a wail now 
and a fluttering beneath it. 

Michael and the woman stood 
above them in the center of the 
pale, hovering faces of the officials. 

“Good God,” said the President. 
“You’ve got to tell them what you 
said isn’t true!” 

“We’ve been searching two thou- 
sand years for a truth,” said 
Michael. “A thousand of us have 
died finding it. I’ve told it. That’s 
the way it’s got to be.” 

The President swayed, took the 
microphone in his hands. 

“There’s been some mistake!” he 
cried. “Go back to the pumps and 
the distilleries! Go back to the wa- 
ter vats and the gardens and the 
flocks! Go back! Work and wait! 
We’ll get the full truth to you. 
Everything’s going to be all right!” 

Obediently the mass of faces 
separated, as though they were be- 
ing spun away on a whirling disk. 
Michael and the woman were swal- 
lowed up, like pebbles inside a clos- 
ing hand, and carried away from 
the great, white ship. 

They ushered the man and wom- 
an into the beamed and paneled 
council chambers and sat them in 
thick chairs before the wall of pol- 
ished wood desks across which 
stared the line of faces, silent and 



waiting. And on a far wall, facing 
them all, hung a silver screen, fifty 
feet square. 

The President stood. “Members 
of the council.” He paused. “As 
you heard, they report — complete 
failure.” He turned to Michael. 
“And now, the proof.” 

Michael stood beside the motion 
picture projector, close to his chair. 
The lights dimmed. There was only 
the sound of the pumps throbbing 
in the darkness close and far away, 
above and beneath and all around. 
Suddenly on the screen appeared 
an endless depth of blackness filled 
with a mass of glowing white, 
which extended into the room 
around the watching people, seem- 
ing to touch them and then spread- 
ing, like an ocean, farther away 
and out and out into an endless 
distance. 

Now streaks of yellow fire shot 
into the picture, like a swarm of 
lightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed 
shadows of space ships, hurtling, 
like comets, toward the clustered 
star smear. And then silent 
thoughts flashed from the screen 
into the minds of the spectators; 
of time passing in months, years 
and centuries, passing and passing 
until they themselves seemed to be 
rushing and rushing into the black- 
ness toward blinding balls of white 
light, the size of moons. 

The dark shapes of smaller 
spheres circling the blinding ones 
moved forward into the picture; 
red, blue, green, yellow, purple and 
many mixtures of all these, and 
then one planet filled the screen, 
seeming to be inflated, like a bal- 
loon, into a shining red ball. There 
was a razor edge of horizon then 




THE VALLEY 



75 



and pink sky and an expanse of 
crimson. Flat, yellow creatures lay 
all around, expanding and con- 
tracting. A roaring rose and fell 
like the roaring of a million winds. 
Then fear flowed out of the picture 
into the minds of the watchers so 
that they gasped and cringed, and 
a silent voice told them that the 
atmosphere of this planet would 
disintegrate a human being. 

Now the red ball seemed to pull 
away from them into the blackness 
and the blinding balls of light, and 
all around could be seen the streaks 
of rocket flame shooting away in 
all directions. 

Suddenly a flash cut the black- 
ness, like the flare of a match, and 
died, and the watchers caught 
from the screen the awareness of 
the death of a ship. 

They were also aware of the 
rushing of time through centuries 
and they saw the streaking rocket 
flames and planets rushing at them ; 
saw creatures in squares and circles, 
in threads wriggling, in lumps and 
blobs, rolling jumping and crawl- 
ing; saw them in cloud forms 
whisking about, changing their 
shapes, and in flowing wavelets of 
water. They saw creatures hopping 
about on one leg and others crawl- 
ing at incredible speeds on a thou- 
sand; saw some with all the num- 
bers of legs and arms in between; 
and were aware of creatures that 
were there but invisible. 

And those watching the screen 
on which time and distance were a 
compressed and distilled kaleido- 
scope, saw planet after planet and 
thousands at a time; heard strange 
noises; rasping and roaring, clinks 
and whistles, screams and crying, 



sighing and moaning. And they 
were aware through all this, of at- 
mosphere and ground inimical to 
man, some that would evaporate at 
the touch of a human body, or 
would burst into flame, or swallow, 
or turn from liquid to solid or solid 
to liquid. They saw and heard 
chemical analyses, were aware of 
this ocean of blackness and clouds 
of white through which man might 
move, and must ever move, be- 
cause he could live only upon this 
floating dust speck that was Earth. 

The picture faded in, close to one 
of the long, needle nosed crafts, 
showing inside, a man and a wom- 
an. Time was telescoped again 
while the man cut a tiny piece of 
scar tissue from his arm and that 
of the woman, put them in bottles 
and set them into compartments 
where solutions dripped rhythmi- 
cally into the bottles, the tempera- 
ture was held at that of the human 
body, and synthetic sunlight fo- 
cused upon them from many pen- 
cil like tubes. 

The watchers in the council 
chamber saw the bits of tissue swell 
into human embryos in a few sec- 
onds, and grow arms and legs and 
faces and extend themselves into 
babies. Saw them taken from the 
bottles and cared for, and become 
replicas of the man and woman 
controlling the ship, who, all this 
time were aging, until life went out 
of their bodies. Then the ones who 
had been the scar tissue disin- 
tegrated them in the coffin-like 
tubes and let their dust be sucked 
out into space — all this through 
millions of miles and a hundred 
years, compressed for the watchers 




76

into sixty seconds and a few feet of 
space. 

Instantly there was black space 
on the screen again, with the fin- 
gers of flame pointing out behind 
the dark bodies of the ships. 

And then the spectators saw one 
ship shudder and swerve into a blaz- 
ing, bluish white star, like a gnat 
flying into a white hot poker; saw 
another drop away and away, out 
and out into the blackness past the 
swirling white rim of the galaxy, 
and sink into a dark nothingness. 

Great balls of rock showered like 
hail onto other ships, smashing 
them into grotesque tin cans. The 
stream of fire at the tail of another 
ship suddenly died and the ship 
floated into an orbit around a great, 
yellow planet, ten times the size of 
Jupiter, then was sucked into it. 
Another burst like a bomb, flinging 
a man and woman out into the 
darkness, where they hung sus- 
pended, frozen into statues, like 
bodies drowned in the depths of an 
Artie sea. 

At this instant from the watching 
council, there were screams of hor- 
ror and voices crying out, “Shut it 
off! Shut it off!” There was a mov- 
ing about in the darkness. Murmurs 
and harsh cries of disapproval grew 
in volume. 

Another ship in the picture was 
split down the side by a meteor and 
the bodies inside were impaled on 
jagged blades of steel, the con- 
torted, bloody faces lighted by 
bursts of flame. And the screams 
and crys of the spectators rose 
higher, “Shut it off . Oh 
Lord . ” 

Lights flashed through the room 
and the picture died. 



M ICHAEL and Mary, both 
staring, saw, along the line 
of desks, the agonized faces, some 
staring like white stones, others 
hidden in clutching fingers, as 
though they had been confronted 
by a Medusa. There was the sound 
of heavy breathing that mixed with 
the throbbing of the pumps. The 
President held tightly to the edges 
of his desk to quiet his trembling. 

“There — there’ve been changes,” 
he said, “since you’ve been out in 
space. There isn’t a person on 
Earth who’s seen a violent death for 
hundreds of years.” 

Michael faced him, frowning. “I 
don’t follow you.” 

“Dying violently happened so 
seldom on Earth that, after a long 
time, the sight of it began to drive 
some people mad. And then one 
day a man was struck by one of the 
ground cars and everyone who saw 
it went insane. Since then we’ve 
eliminated accidents, even the idea. 
Now, no one is aware that death by 
violence is even a possibility.” 

“I’m sorry,” said Michael, 
“we’ve been so close to violent 
death for so long. What you’ve 
seen is part of the proof you asked 
for.” 

“What you showed us was a pic- 
ture,” said the President. “If it had 
been real, we’d all be insane by 
now. If it were shown to the people 
there’d be mass hysteria.” 

“But even if we’d found another 
habitable planet, getting to it 
would involve just what we’ve 
shown you. Maybe only a tenth of 
the people who left Earth, or a 
hundredth, would ever reach a 
destination out in space.” 

“We couldn’t tolerate such a pos-

sibility,” said the President gravely. 
“We’d have to find a way around 
it.” 

The pumps throbbed like giant 
hearts all through the stillness in 
the council chambers. The faces 
along the line of desks were smooth- 
ing out; ths terror in them was 
fading away. 

“And yet the Earth is almost 
dead,” said Michael quietly, “and 
you can’t bring it back to life.” 

“The sins of our past, Mr. Nel- 
son,” said the President. “The 
Atomic wars five thousand years 
ago. And the greed. It was too late 
a long time ago. That, of course, 
is why the expedition was sent out. 
And now you’ve come back to us 
with this terrible news.” He looked 
around, slowly, then back to Mi- 
chael. Gan you give us any hope 
at all?” 

“None.” 

“Another expedition? To An- 
dromeda perhaps? With you the 
leader?” 

Michael shook his head. “We’re 
finished with expeditions, Mr. 
President.” 

There were mutterings in the 
council, and hastily whispered con- 
sultations. Now they were watch- 
ing the man and woman again. 

“We feel,” said the President, 
“it would be dangerous to allow 
you to go out among the people. 
They’ve been informed that your 
statement wasn’t entirely true. This 
was necessary, to avoid a panic. The 
people simply must not know the 
whole truth.” He paused. “Now we 
ask you to keep in mind that what- 
ever we decide about the two of 
you will be for the good of the peo- 
ple.” 



Michael and Mary were silent. 

“You’ll wait outside the council 
chambers,” the President went on, 
“until we have reached our de- 
cision.” 

As the man and woman were led 
away, the pumps beat in the still- 
ness, and at the edge of the shrink- 
ing seas the salt thick waters were 
being pulled into the distilleries, and 
from them into the tier upon tier 
of artificial gardens that sat like 
giant bee hives all around the 
shoreline; and the mounds of salt 
glistening in the sunlight behind 
the gardens were growing into 
mountains. 



I N THEIR rooms, Michael and 
Mary were talking through the 
hours, and waiting. All around 
them were fragile, form-fitting 
chairs and translucent walls and a 
ceiling that, holding the light of the 
sun when they had first seen it, was 
now filled with moonlight. 

Standing at a circular window, 
ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, 
far below, the lights of the city ex- 
tending into the darkness along the 
shoreline of the sea. 

“We should have delivered our 
message by radio,” he said, “and 
gone back into space.” 

“You could probably still go,” 
she said quietly. 

He came and stood beside her. “I 
couldn’t stand being out in space, 
or anywhere, without you.” 

She looked up at him. “We could 
go out into the wilderness, Michael, 
outside the force walls. We could go 
far away.” 

He turned from her. “It’s all 
dead. What would be the use?”

RICHARD STOCKHAM 



“I came from the Earth,*’ she 
said quietly. “And Fve got to go 
back to it. Space is so cold and 
frightening. Steel walls and black- 
ness and the rockets and the little 
pinpoints of light. It’s a prison.” 
“But to die out there in the des- 
ert, in that dust.” Then he paused 
and looked away from her. “We’re 
crazy — talking as though we had a 
choice.” 

“Maybe they’ll have to give us a 
choice.” 

“What’re you talking about?” 
“They went into hysterics at the 
sight of those bodies in the picture. 
Those young bodies that didn’t die 
of old age.” 

He waited. 

“They can’t stand the sight of 
people dying violently.” 

Her hand went to her throat and 
touched the tiny locket. 

“These lockets were given to us 
so we’d have a choice between suf- 
fering or quick painless death . 
We still have a choice.” 

He touched the locket at his own 
throat and was very still for a long 
moment. “So we threaten to kill 
ourselves, before their eyes. What 
would it do to them?” 

He was still for a long time. 
“Sometimes, Mary, I think I don’t 
know you at all.” A pause. “And 
so now you and I are back where 
we started. Which’ll it be, space or 
Earth?” 

“Michael.” Her voice trembled. 
“I — I don’t know how to say this.” 
He waited, frowning, watching 
her intently. 

“I’m — going to have a child.” 

His face went blank. 

Then he stepped forward and 
took her by the shoulders. He saw 



the softness there in her face; saw 
her eyes bright as though the sun 
were shining in them; saw a flush 
in her cheeks, as though she had 
been running. And suddenly his 
throat was full. 

“No,” he said thickly. “I can’t 
believe it.” 

“It’s true.” 

He held her for a long time, then 
he turned his eyes aside. 

“Yes, I can see it is.” 

“I — I can’t put into words why I 
let it happen, Michael.” 

He shook his head. “I don’t know 
— what to — to say. It’s so incredi- 
ble.” 

“Maybe — I got so — tired — just 
seeing the two of us over and over 
again and the culturing of the scar 
tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe 
that was it. It was just — something 
I felt I had to do. Some — real life 
again. Something new. I felt a need 
to produce something out of myself. 
It all started way out in space, 
while we were getting close to the 
solar system. I began to wonder if 
we’d ever get out of the ship alive 
or if we’d ever see a sunset again or 
a dawn or the night or morning like 
we’d seen on Earth — so — so long 
ago. And then I had to let it hap- 
pen. It was a vague and strange 
thing. There was something forcing 
me. But at the same time I wanted 
it, too. I seemed to be willing it, 
seemed to be feeling it was a neces- 
sary thing.” She paused, frowning. 
“I didn’t stop to think — it would be 
like this.” 

“Such a thing,” he said, smiling 
grimly, “hasn’t happened on Earth 
for three thousand years. I can re- 
member in school, reading in the 
history books, how the whole Earth 




THE VALLEY 



79 



was overcrowded and how the food 
and water had to be rationed and 
then how the laws were passed for- 
bidding birth and after that how 
the people died and there weren’t 
anymore babies born, until at last 
there was plenty of what the Earth 
had to give, for everyone. And then 
the news was broken to everyone 
about the culturing of the scar tis- 
sue, and there were a few dissent- 
ers but they were soon conditioned 
out of their dissension and the pop- 
ulation was stabilized.” He paused. 
“After all this past history, I don’t 
think the council could endure what 
you’ve done.” 

“No,” she said quietly. “I don’t 
think they could.” 

“And so this will be just for us ” 
He took her in his arms. “If I re- 
member rightly, this is a traditional 
action.” A pause. “Now I’ll go with 
you out onto the Earth — if we can 
swing it. When we get outside the 
city, or if we do — Well, we’ll see.” 

They were very still together and 
then he turned and stood by the 
window and looked down upon the 
city and she came and stood beside 
him. 



T HEY BOTH saw it at the same 
time. And they watched, with- 
out speaking, both knowing what 
was in the other’s mind and heart. 
They watched the giant four di- 
mensional screens all through the 
city. A green, lush planet showed 
bright and clear on them and there 
were ships standing among the 
trees and men walking through the 
grass, that moved gently like the 
swells on a calm ocean, while into 
their minds came the thoughts pro- 



jected from the screen: 

“This will be your new home. 
It was found and then lost. But an- 
other expedition will be sent out to 
find it again. Be of good hope. 
Everything will be all right.” 
Michael turned from the win- 
dow. “So there’s our evidence. Two 
thousand years. All the others 
killed getting it. And with a sim- 
ple twist, it becomes a lie.” 

Mary sat down and buried her 
face in her hands. 

“What a terrible failure there’s 
been here,” said Michael. “The 
neglect and destruction of a whole 
planet. It’s like a family letting 
their home decay all around them, 
and living in smaller and smaller 
rooms of it, until at last the rooms 
are all gone, and since they can’t 
find another home, they all die in 
the ruins of the last room.” 

“I can’t face dying,” Mary said 
quietly, “squeezed in with all these 
people, in this tomb they’ve made 
around the seas. I want to have the 
open sky and the quiet away from 
those awful pounding pumps when 
I die. I want the spread of the 
Earth all around and the clean air. 
I want to be a real part of the Earth 
again.” 

Michael barely nodded in agree- 
ment. He was standing very still 
now. 

And then there was the sound of 
the door opening. 

They both rose, like mourners at 
a funeral, and went into the council 
chambers. 

Again they sat in the thick chairs 
before the wall of desks with the 
faces of the council looking across 
it like defenders.

RICHARD STOCKHAM 



The pumps were beating, beat- 
ing all through the room and the 
quiet. 

The President was standing. He 
faced Michael and Mary, and 
seemed to set himself as though to 
deliver a blow, or to receive one. 

“Michael and Mary,” he said, 
his voice struggling against a tight- 
ness, “we’ve considered a long time 
concerning what is to be done with 
you and the report you brought 
back to us from the galaxy.” He 
took another swallow of water. “To 
protect the sanity of the people, 
we’ve changed your report. We’ve 
also decided that the people must 
be protected from the possibility of 
your spreading the truth, as you did 
at the landing field. So, for the good 
of the people, you’ll be isolated. All 
comforts will be given you. After 
all, in a sense, you are heroes and 
martyrs. Your scar tissue will be 
cultured as it has been in the past, 
and you will stay in solitary confine- 
ment until the time when, perhaps, 
we can migrate to another planet. 
We feel that hope must not be de- 
stroyed. And so another expedition 
is being sent out. It may be that, 
in time, on another planet, you’ll be 
able to take your place in our so- 
ciety.” 

He paused. “Is there anything you 
wish to say?” 

“Yes, there is.” 

“Proceed.” 

Michael stared straight at the 
President. After a long moment, he 
raised his hand to the tiny locket at 
his throat. 

“Perhaps you remember,” he 
said, “the lockets given to every 
member of the expedition the night 
before we left. I still have mine.” 



He raised it. “So does my wife. 
They were designed to kill the wear- 
er instantly and painlessly if he 
were ever faced with pain or a ter- 
ror he couldn’t endure.” 

The President was standing 
again. A stir ran along the barri- 
cade of desks. 

“We can’t endure the city,” went 
on Michael, “or its life and the 
ways of the people.” He glanced 
along the line of staring faces. 

“If what I think you’re about to 
say is true,” said the President in a 
shaking voice, “it would have been 
better if you’d never been born.” 

“Let’s face facts, Mr. President. 
We were born and haven’t died — 
yet.” A pause. “And we can kill 
ourselves right here before your 
eyes. It’d be painless to us. We’d be 
unconscious. But there would be 
horrible convulsions and grimaces. 
Our bodies would be twisted and 
tom. They’d thresh about. The 
deaths you saw in the picture hap- 
pened a long time ago, in outer 
space. You all went into hysterics 
at the sight of them. Our deaths 
now would be close and terrible to 
see.” 

The President staggered as 
though about to faint. There was a 
stirring and muttering and a jump- 
ing up along the desks. Voices cried 
out, in anger and fear. Arms waved 
and fists pounded. Hands clasped 
and unclasped and clawed at col- 
lars, and there was a pell mell rush- 
ing around the President. They 
yelled at each other and clasped 
each other by the shoulders, turned 
away and back again, and then sud- 
denly became very still. 

Now they began to step down 
from the raised line of desks, the

81 



President leading them, and came 
close to the man and woman, gath- 
ering around them in a wide half 
circle. 

Michael and Mary were holding 
the lockets close to their throats. 
The half circle of people, with the 
President at its center was moving 
closer and closer. They were sweaty 
faces and red ones and dry white 
ones and hands were raised to seize 
them. 

Michael put his arm around 
Mary’s waist. He felt the trembling 
in her body and the waiting for 
death. 

“Stop!” he said quietly. 

They halted, in slight confusion, 
barely drawing back. 

“If you want to see us die — just 
come a step closer . And remem- 
ber what’ll happed to you.” 

The faces began turning to each 
other and there was an undertone 
of muttering and whispering. “A 
ghastly thing . Instant . Noth- 
ing to do . Space’s broken their 
minds . .They’ll do it . Eyes’ re 
mad . What can we do? . 
What? . The sweaty faces, the 
cold white ones, the flushed hot 
ones : all began to turn to the Presi- 
dent, who was staring at the two 
before him like a man watching 
himself die in a mirror. 

“I command you,” he suddenly 
said, in a choked voice, “to — to give 
me those — lockets! It’s your — 
duty!” 

“We’ve only one duty, Mr. Presi- 
dent,” said Michael sharply. “To 
ourselves.” 

“You’re sick. Give yourselves over 
to us. We’ll help you.” 

“We’ve made our choice. We 
want an answer. Quickly! Now!” 



The President’s body sagged. 
“What — what is it you want?” 

Michael threw the words. “To go 
beyond the force fields of the city. 
To go far out onto the Earth and 
live as long as we can, and then to 
die a natural death.” 

The half circle of faces turned to 
each other and muttered and whis- 
pered again. “In the name of God 
. Let them go . Contaminate 
us . Like animals . Get them 
out of here . Let them be fin- 
ished . Best for us all . And 
them . .” 

There was a turning to the Presi- 
dent again and hands thrusting 
him forward to within one step of 
Michael and Mary, who were 
standing there close together, as 
though attached. 

Haltingly he said, “Go. Please go. 
Out onto the Earth — to die. You 
will die. The Earth is dead out 
there. You’ll never see the city or 
your people again.” 

“We want a ground car,” said 
Michael. “And supplies.” 

“A ground car,” repeated the 
President. “And — supplies. 
Yes.” 

“You can give us an escort, if you 
want to, out beyond the first range 
of mountains.” 

“There will be no escort,” said 
the President firmly. “No one has 
been allowed to go out upon the 
Earth or to fly above it for many 
hundreds of years. We know it’s 
there. That’s enough. We couldn’t 
bear the sight of it.” He took a step 
back. “And we can’t bear the sight 
of you any longer. Go no\V. Quick- 
ly!” . 

Michael and Mary did not let go 
of the lockets as they watched the 




82 



RICHARD STOCKHAM 



half circle of faces move backward, 
staring, as though at corpses that 
should sink to the floor. 



I T WAS night. The city had been 
lost beyond the dead mounds of 
Earth that rolled away behind 
them, like a thousand ancient 
tombs. The ground car sat still on 
a crumbling road. 

Looking up through the car’s 
driving blister, they saw the stars 
sunk into the blue black ocean of 
space; saw the path of the Milky 
Way along which they had rushed, 
while they had been searching 
frantically for the place of salvation. 

“If any one of the other couples 
had made it back,” said Mary, “do 
you think they’d be with us?” 

“I think they’d either be with 
us,” he said, “or out in space again 
— or in prison.” 

She stared ahead along the beam 
of headlight that stabbed out into 
the night over the decaying road. 

“How sorry are you,” she said 
quietly, “coming with me?” 

“All I know is, if I were out in 
space for long without you, I’d kill 
myself.” 

“Are we going to die out here, 
Michael?” she said, gesturing to- 
ward the wall of night that stood at 
the end of the headlight, “with the 
land?” 

He turned from her, frowning, 
and drove the ground car forward, 
watching the headlights push back 
the darkness. 

They followed the crumbling 
highway all night until light crept 
across the bald and cracked hills. 
The morning sun looked down up- 
on the desolation ten feet above the 



horizon when the car stopped. They 
sat for a long time then, looking 
out upon the Earth’s parched and 
inflamed skin. In the distance a 
wall of mountains rose like a great 
pile of bleached bones. Close ahead 
the rolling plains were motionless 
waves of dead Earth with a slight 
breeze stirring up little swirls of 
dust. 

“I’m getting out,” she said. 

“I haven’t the slightest idea how 
much farther to go, or why,” said 
Michael shrugging. “It’s all the 
same. Dirt and hills and mountains 
and sun and dust. It’s really not 
much different from being out in 
space. We live in the car just like 
in a space ship. We’ve enough con- 
centrated supplies to last for a year. 
How far do we go? Why? When?” 

They stepped upon the Earth 
and felt the warmth of the sun and 
strolled toward the top of the hill. 

“The air smells clean,” he said. 

“The ground feels good. I think 
I’ll take off my shoes.” She did. 
“Take off your boots, Michael. Try 
it.” 

Wearily he pulled off his boots, 
stood in his bare feet. “It takes me 
back.” 

“Yes,” she said and began walk- 
ing toward the hilltop. 

He followed, his boots slung 
around his neck. “There was a road 
somewhere, with the dust between 
my toes. Or was it a dream?” 

“I guess when the past is old 
enough,” she said, “it becomes a 
dream.” 

He watched her footprints in the 
dust. “God, listen to the quiet.” 

“I can’t seem to remember so 
much quiet around me. There’s al- 
ways been the sound of a space ship.

or the pumps back in the cities.” 

He did not answer but continued 
to watch her footsteps and to feel 
the dust squishing up between his 
toes. Then suddenly: 

“Mary!” 

She stopped, whirling around. 

He was staring down at her feet. 

She followed his gaze. 

“It’s grass!” He bent down. 
“Three blades.” 

She knelt beside him. They 
touched the green blades. 

“They’re new,” he said. 

They stared, like religious de- 
votees concentrating upon some 
sacred object. 

He rose, pulling her up with him. 
They hurried to the top of the hill 
and stood very still, looking down 
into a valley. There were tiny 
patches of green and little trees 
sprouting, and here and there, a 
pale flower. The green was in a 
cluster, in the center of the valley 
and there was a tiny glint of sun- 
light in its center. 

“Oh!” 

Her hand found his. 

They ran down the gentle slope, 
feeling the patches of green touch 
their feet, smelling a new freshness 
in the air. And coming to the little 
spring, they stood beside it and 
watched the crystal water that 
trickled along the valley floor and 
lost itself around a bend. They saw 
a furry, little animal scurry away 
and heard the twitter of a bird and 
saw it resting on a slim, bending 



branch. They heard the buzz of a 
bee, saw it light on a pale flower 
at their feet and work at the sweet- 
ness inside. 

Mary knelt down and drank from 
the spring. 

“It’s so cool. It must come from 
deep down.” 

“It does,” he said. There were 
tears in his eyes and a tightness in 
his throat. “From deep down.” 

“We can live here, Michael!” 
Slowly he looked all around until 
his sight stopped at the bottom of 
a hill. “We’ll build our house just 
beyond those rocks. We’ll dig and 
plant and you’ll have the child.” 
“Yes!” she said. “Oh yes!” 

“And the ones back in the city 
will know the Earth again. Some- 
time we’ll lead them back here and 
show them the Earth is coming 
alive.” He paused. “By following 
what we had to do for ourselves, 
we’ve found a way to save them.” 
They remained kneeling in the 
silence beside the pool for a long 
time. They felt the sun on their 
backs and looked into the clean 
depth of the water deeply aware of 
the new life breathing all around 
them and of themselves absorbing 
it, and at the same time giving back 
to it the life that was their own. 

There was only this quiet and 
breathing and warmth until Mi- 
chael stood and picked up a rock 
and walked toward the base of the 
hill where he had decided to build 
the house. • • • THE END

LARK DECKER winced and 
scrounged still lower in his 
seat as Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin rested 
her enormous bosom on the front of 
the podium and smiled down on 
the Patriot Daughters of America 
in convention assembled as she an- 
nounced: “And now, my dears, I 
will read you one more short quo- 
tation from Major Wicks’ fascinat- 
ing book ‘The Minor Tactics of 
The American Revolution.’ When 
I am finished, I know that you will 
all agree that Rebecca Johns-Hayes 
will be a more than fitting successor 
to myself as your President.” 

Decker looked wildly about for a 



way of escape from the convention 
auditorium. If he had only re- 
mained in the anteroom with Pro- 
fessor MacCulloch and the His- 
torical Reintergrator! After suffer- 
ing through four days of speeches 
by ladies in various stages of mam- 
malian top-heaviness, he hadn’t be- 
lieved it possible that anyone could 
top Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin for 
either sheer ability to bore or for 
the nobility of her bust. Mrs. 
Rebecca Johns-Hayes had come 
as something of a shock as she 
squirmed her way onto the speak- 
er’s platform. But there she was as 
big as life, or rather bigger, smil-

in g at Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin, the 
Past President^ beaming at Mrs. 
Lynd-Torris, a defeated candidate 
for the presidency and whose an- 
cestor had been only a captain, and 
completely ignoring Mrs. Tolman, 
the other defeated candidate whose 
ancestor had been so inconsiderate 
as to have been a Continental ser- 
geant. Only the thought that now 
that the voting was over and the 
new president chosen, the ladies 
might be ready for the demonstra- 
tion of the Reintergrator had 
brought Decker onto the conven- 
tion floor, and now he was trapped 
and would have to listen. 

“And so,” Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin 
was reading, “upon such small 
events do the great moments of his- 
tory depend. The brilliant scouting 
and skirmishing of the riflemen un- 
der Colonel Peter Johns prevented 
the breakthrough of Captain Fos- 
dick’s column and the possible 
flanking of the American army be- 
fore Saratoga. Thus, this little 
known action may have been the 
deciding factor in the whole cam- 
paign that prevented General Bur- 
goyne from carrying out the British 
plan to divide the colonies and end 
the war. It is impossible for the his- 
torian to refrain from speculation 
as to what might have happened 
had Colonel Johns not been on 
hand to direct the riflemen and 
militia in this section; as indeed he 
might not have been, since his own 
regiment of short-term enlistees had 
returned to Pennsylvania a few days 
previously. Only the Colonel’s pa- 
triotism and devotion to duty kept 
him in the field and made his abili- 
ties available to the country when 
they were most needed.” 



Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin waited 
until the burst of applause had died 
down and then continued, “That is 
the man whose great-great-great- 
great - granddaughter you have 
elected your president today 
Mrs. Rebecca Johns-Hayes!” Turn- 
ing to Mrs. Johns-Hayes she went 
on, “Before you make your accept- 
ance speech, dear, we have a little 
surprise for you.” 

Clark Decker had been edging 
his way toward the side of the audi- 
torium where the Men’s Auxiliary 
of the Daughters had their seats but 
he turned back at the mention of 
the surprise. It sounded as though 
it was time for him and the Pro- 
fessor to start their demonstration. 

“A surprise which we hope will 
also be a surprise to the whole 
world of science,” Mrs. Appleby- 
Simpkin was holding the podium 
against a determinedly advancing 
Mrs. Johns-Hayes. “Indeed we 
may be able to say in future years, 
that the 1989 Convention of the 
Patriot Daughters was marked by 
the first public demonstration of 
one of the most momentous inven- 
tions in the history of science.” The 
Past President was speaking faster 
and faster, because the new Presi- 
dent with a hand full of notes was 
doing her best to edge her away 
from both the podium and the 
microphone. 

“Thank you, darling,” Mrs. 
Johns-Hayes said, pulling the mi- 
crophone firmly toward her, “but 
we really must get along with busi- 
ness. I have quite a few things I 
want to say and several motions 
which I want to place before the 
Convention.” 

“And as I was saying, dear,” Mrs.

Appleby-Simpkin said, pulling the 
microphone back with equal firm- 
ness, “I know that you will be just 
unbearably thrilled.” There was an- 
other brief struggle for the mike 
and Mrs. Appleby-Simpkin won 
and went on. “I know that he will 
be just as proud of you as you are 
of him. That is why we have ar- 
ranged for Professor MacCulloch 
to demonstrate his historical Reinte- 
grator at our convention by bring- 
ing into our midst Colonel Peter 
Johns, the hero of the action at 
Temple Farm, to see his great- 
great-great-great-granddaughter in- 
stalled as the fifty-fourth president 
of the Loyal Order of Patriot 
Daughters of America. Now I . 
Mrs. Johns-Hayes again won con- 
trol of the mike. 

“Thank you very much, dear.” 
Her voice was a genteel screech. 
“I’m sure that we will be only too 
glad to have the ... who? Who 
did you say?” Mrs. Appleby-Simp- 
kin regained the microphone from 
the other woman’s relaxing grip. 

“I believe I see Mr. Decker, the 
Professor’s assistant, in the audi- 
ence,” she said. “Will you be so 
good as to tell the Professor that 
we are ready for his epic-making 
experiment?” 

With a great feeling of relief, 
Decker escaped from the rising tur- 
moil of the convention hall into the 
relative quiet of the anteroom 
where MacCulloch waited with the 
Reintegrator. He found the Profes- 
sor sitting with his head in his hands 
staring at the machine. The little 
man looked up and smiled quiz- 
zically as his assistant approached 
him. 

“They’re ready, Professor ! They’re 



ready!” Still under the influence 
of the convention, Decker found 
himself shouting. 

“Ah. Ah, yes. Then it will be to- 
day. I’ve waited so long. Ten years 
of work and now instead of a scien- 
tific gathering, I have to demon- 
strate my machine before a wom- 
an’s club.” 



D ECKER began to wheel the 
platform which held the Re- 
integrator toward the door. “After 
today, Professor, all the scientific 
organizations in the world will have 
heard of you and will be demand- 
ing demonstrations.” 

“Yes, but these Patriot Daugh- 
ters! Who are they? Who in the 
scientific world ever heard of 
them?” 

“No one except a few scientists 
unfortunate enough to fall afoul 
of their Loyalty and Conformity 
Committee.” 

“I think we should have gone 
elsewhere for our demonstration.” 
“Now Professor. Who in the 
world today would be interested in 
the past except a group of ancestor 
conscious women?” 

“Some historical society per- 
haps,” the Professor said wistfully. 

“And what historical society 
could have advanced the twenty 
thousand dollars we needed to com- 
plete the machine?” 

“I suppose you’re right, my boy,” 
MacCulloch sighed as he helped 
push the Reintegrator onto the 
auditorium floor. 

By the time Clark Decker reached 
the platform to explain the demon- 
stration, the fight for the micro- 
phone had turned into a three-way 




88 



GEORGE H. SMITH 



struggle. A lady who represented 
the Finance Committee was trying 
to win it away from both the Past 
President and the new President. 

Taking them by surprise, Decker 
managed to gain control long 
enough to explain what was about 
to happen. 

“You mean/’ demanded Mrs. 
Johns-Hayes, “that this is some sort 
of time machine and you’re going 
to transport great-great-great-great- 
grandfather from the past into the 
present?” 

“No, Mrs. Hayes. This isn’t a 
time machine in the comic book use 
of the term. It is just what Profes- 
sor MacCulloch has called it, an 
historical Reintegrator. The theory 
upon which it is based, the Mac- 
Culloch Reaction, says that every 
person who ever existed, and every 
event which ever took place caused 
electrical disturbances in the space- 
time continuum of the universe by 
displacing an equal and identical 
group of electrons. The task of the 
Reintegrator is to reassemble those 
electrons. That is why Professor 
MacCulloch is now placing your 
ancestor’s sword in the machine. 
We will use that as a base point 
from which our recreation will be- 
gin.” 

The machine was humming and 
small lights were beginning to play 
about its tubes and dials. “If our 
calculations are accurate, and we 
believe that they are,” Decker said, 
“within a very few minutes, Colo- 
nel Johns should be standing before 
us as he was on a day approxi- 
mately a week before his heroic ac- 
tion in the battle at Temple Farm.” 

Mrs. Johns-Hayes, although still 
gripping her notes, was beginning 



to get a little flustered. “Oh my, 
that would be before he married 
great-great-great-great-grandmoth- 
er Sayles. They were married only 
two days before the battle, you 
know. It was so romantic ... a war- 
time romance and all.” 

“Just imagine,” Mrs. Tolman 
remarked, “at that time your whole 
family was just a gleam in the Colo- 
nel’s eye!” 

Professor MacCulloch made one 
or two last passes at the machine 
and then stood back to watch, a 
look of pure scientific ecstasy on his 
face. A mistiness began to gather on 
the platform where the Colonel’s 
sword lay and through it from time 
to time shot sparks of electricity. 
Suddenly a gasp went up from the 
assembled Daughters as a man’s 
head and shoulders appeared and 
expanded downward, a long way 
downward, to a large pair of feet. 
There was one last hum from the 
machine and then a tall young man 
in faded blue regimentals and very 
much in need of a shave was stand- 
ing blinking in the blazing lights of 
the auditorium. 

“Oh, Mr. Decker, surely there’s 
some mistake!” was Mrs. Johns- 
Hayes’ first comment as she sur- 
veyed the very tall, very tattered, 
and very dirty young man. “Great- 
great-great-great-grandfather’s pic- 
tures always show him as a digni- 
fied old gentleman.” 

The Colonel took one quick look 
around and made a grab for his 
sword, but the Professor managed 
to calm him and to explain the sit- 
uation before any violence could 
take place. After a few minutes of 
hurried talk, MacCulloch steered 
the Colonel in the direction of the 




THE ORDEAL OF COLONEL JOHNS 



89 



speaker’s platform for the meeting 
with his great-great-great-great- 
granddaughter. 

Peter Johns’ bewilderment faded 
into astonishment, but he still 
gripped his sword as the Professor 
guided him through the throngs of 
excited ladies onto the stage. He 
paused momentarily to look at the 
brilliant lights and at the huge num- 
ber of American flags which hung 
overhead. A picture of George 
Washington, hung among the 
flags, seemed to reassure him and 
he allowed the Professor to lead 
him to Mrs. Johns-Hayes. 

That lady had drawn herself to- 
gether at the approach of her an- 
cestor and had obviously decided to 
carry it off as best she could. She 
advanced to meet him crying, 
“Dear, dear great-great-great-great- 
grandfather! This is such a pleas- 
ure! You can’t know how proud all 
of us in the family have always been 
of you.” 

The young Continental officer 
stared open mouthed at the red- 
faced, big-bosomed woman who 
was twice his age, but who ad- 
dressed him as great-great-great- 
great-grandfather. Then he turned 
to MacCulloch who stood beside 
him. “Are you sure you have the 
right man?” he asked. 

“Oh yes! Perfectly, perfectly! 
You’re Colonel Peter Johns of 
Pamworth, Pennsylvania, and this 
is your great-great-great-great- 
granddaughter, Rebecca Johns- 
Hayes.” 

“Rebecca? You mean she’s named 
after Becky Sayles?” The Colo- 
nel rubbed a hand across his sev- 
eral days’ growth of beard. 

“That’s right, dear great-great- 



great-great-grandfather. I’m named 
after great-great-great-great-grand- 
mother,” Mrs. Johns-Hayes an- 
nounced. 

“Then I married Becky Sales?” 
the Colonel asked. 

“Why, of course! Aren’t you 
planning on getting married in a 
few days?” Clark Decker asked. 

The Colonel was embarrassed but 
he grinned, “Well, I don’t rightly 
know. Miss Sayles and I have been 
courtin’ for some months but there’s 
little Jennie Taylor down in Tren- 
ton ... To tell the truth, I haven’t 
quite made up my mind.” 

“Well! Of all things! What would 
the family think! What would great 
Aunt Mary Hayes say?” Mrs. 
Johns-Hayes puffed out even far- 
ther than usual. 

“Well, we can ease your mind on 
that subject, Colonel. The history 
books say that you married Miss 
Sayles — and here is Mrs. Johns- 
Hayes to prove it.” 

The Colonel scratched his chin 
again as he looked at Mrs. Johns- 
Hayes. “Is that so? Is that so? 
What’s all this about history books? 
You mean I got in history because 
I married Becky Sayles?” 

The Professor laughed. “Well, 
not exactly. It was because of your 
heroism in the defeat of Burgoyne’s 
army. If you hadn’t blocked Cap- 
tain Fenwick’s flanking move at 
Temple Farm, the American army 
under General Gates might have 
been defeated and the Colonies 
might even have lost the war.” 
“Well, I’ll be . Me? I did all 
that? I didn’t even know there was 
going to be a battle. Did I end up a 
live hero or a dead one?” The 
Colonel was beginning to feel a bit 




90 

more easy in his surroundings, and, 
to the horror of Mrs. Johns-Hayes, 
took a plug of tobacco out of his 
pocket and bit off a piece and be- 
gan to chew it. 

“You came through the battle 
with only a slight wound and lived 
to a ripe old age surrounded by 
grandchildren,” the Professor told 
him. 

“Then I reckon I won’t go back 
to Pennsylvania with the other 
boys. They figure that since their 
enlistments are up, it’s time to get 
back to the farm and let them New 
Yorkers do some of their own fight- 
mg. 

“Oh no! You weren’t thinking of 
going back — of leaving the 
fighting?” Mrs. Johns-Hayes de- 
manded. 

The Colonel shifted his wad of 
tobacco and looked at the woman 
carefully as though he couldn’t 
quite believe the evidence of his 
eyes. “No, ma’am, I don’t reckon 
I am. I don’t exactly look on it the 
same as the other boys do. I kind 
of feel like if we’re ever going to 
have a country, it’s worth fighting 
for.” 

Mrs. Johns-Hayes beamed, as did 
all the other officers of the Daugh- 
ters. “Well, your faith and heroism 
have been rewarded, great-great- 
great-great-grandfather. I know 
you’ll be proud to know that these 
ladies whom you see before you are 
the present guardians of the ideals 
that you fought for.” 

“Well, now, is that so, ma’am? 
Is that so?” Peter Johns looked 
around the convention hall in 
amazement. 

“And that I, your descendant, 



GEORGE H. SMITH 

have just been elected their Presi- 
dent!” 

“Well, what do you know about 
that! Maybe all the hard times and 
the danger we been going through 
is worth it if you folks still remem- 
ber the way we felt about things.” 
“It’s too bad,” Decker whispered 
to MacCulloch, “that we can’t let 
him see what the country is really 
like. I’m not sure these ladies are 
representative.” 

There was a worried look on the 
Professor’s face. “That’s impossi- 
ble. The reintegration is good for 
only an hour or so. I hope nothing 
goes wrong here.” 

Mrs. Appleby - Simpkin took 
charge of the Colonel and ushered 
him to a seat of honor near the 
podium while the new President 
prepared to deliver her speech. 
Decker and the professor managed 
to obtain seats on either side of 
Johns just as Rebecca started. He 
managed to whisper to them, “I’m 
sure amazed! I’m sure amazed! All 
these nice old ladies feeling the 
same way about things as we do.” 

D ECKER had a premonition 
of trouble as Mrs. Hayes’ 
words poured forth. He had hoped 
for a cut and dried acceptance 
speech with nothing but the usual 
patriotic platitudes, but, as she 
went on his worst fears were real- 
ized. Inspired by the presence of 
her ancestor, the woman was going 
into superlatives about the pur- 
poses and aims of the Patriot 
Daughters. She covered everything 
from the glories of her ancestry to 
the morals of the younger genera- 
tion and women in politics.

Decker watched the Coloners 
face, saw it changed from puzzle- 
ment to painful boredom as word 
after word floated from the battery 
of speakers overhead. 

MacCulloch was whispering in 
Johns’ ear in an attempt to draw 
his attention from the woman’s 
booming voice but the man disre- 
garded him. “Am I really respon- 
sible for that? The Colonel jerked 
his head in the direction of Mrs. 
Johns-Hayes. 

“I’m afraid, Colonel, that you’re 
getting a distorted idea of what 
America is like in our time,” Deck- 
er said. The Colonel didn’t even 
turn to look at him. He was scowl- 
ing at his Amazonian descendant 
as her screeching reached new 
heights. 

“. and we hold that this is 
true! Our simple motto, as you all 
know, is: One race, one creed, one 
way of thinking!” 

Colonel Johns began to squirm 
violently in his seat. The professor 
found it necessary to grasp him 
firmly by one arm while Decker 
held him by the. other. 

The president of the Patriot 
Daughters had finished her speech 
amidst thunderous applause and 
started to present suggestions for 
the formation of new committees, 
for the passing of new by-laws and 
for resolutions. 

“A committee should be formed 
to see that the public parks are 
properly policed to prevent so- 
called ‘spooners’ from pursuing 
their immoral behaviour. 

“A new by-law is needed,” and 
here Mrs. Hayes glanced aside at 
Mrs. Tolman, “to prevent mem- 
bers being accepted unless their 



forebears were lieutenants or of 
higher rank in the glorious Conti- 
nental army.” 

The Colonel was a strong man 
and both Decker and MacCulloch 
were older than he. With some- 
thing between a snort and a roar 
he shook them loose and started for 
the exit. 

“Oh my,” MacCulloch moaned, 
“I was afraid that this whole thing 
was a mistake.” 

Colonel Johns had taken only 
two steps toward the door when 
he seemed to stagger. MacCulloch 
leaped to his side and caught him 
by the arm. There was an uproar 
in the auditorium as the Colonel 
faded slightly and the professor 
hurried him down the steps toward 
the Reintegrator. 

“I’m afraid the Colonel isn’t go- 
ing to be with us much longer,” 
the professor explained. 

Thank goodness, Decker thought, 
I don’t believe the poor man could 
have stood it much longer. 

“I’m afraid the reintegration 
time of Colonel Johns is running 
out and he must return to his own 
time,” the professor went on. 

The grim-faced Colonel said 
nothing as MacCulloch led him up 
to the machine. 

“Goodbye, great-great-great- 
great-grandfather,” Mrs. Johns- 
Hayes called from the platform. “It 
has been so nice having you with 
us.” 

“Goodbye, Rebecca,” the Colo- 
nel said as he began to fade away. 

“Give my regards to great-great- 
great-great-grandmother.” 

The figure in the dirty, faded 
blue uniform was gone but Decker 
(Continued on page 105) 




Theirs was a world of great culture yet their destiny had ever 
been run , run , run — flee the Hunters. Even with the near per- 
fection of the Concerts, the ultimate advance of civilized man, 
they would run once again. But this time there were two who 
stayed behind .

T WAS NEARLY sundown 
when Ravdin eased the ship 
down into the last slow arc toward 
the Earth’s surface. Stretching his 
arms and legs, he tried to relax 
and ease the tension in his tired 
muscles. Carefully he tightened the 
seat belt for landing; then he 
blinked eagerly down at the vast, 
tangled expanse of Jungle-land be- 
low him. Several miles ahead was 
the bright circle of the landing 
field, with the sparkling glow of the 
city beyond. Momentarily his eyes 
swept the horizon beyond the city, 
hoping to catch a glimpse of the 
Concert before he was swallowed 
by the brilliant lights. 

A bell chimed softly in his ear, 
and Ravdin brought his attention 



back to the landing operation. He 
was still numb and shaken from the 
Warp-passage, his mind still mud- 
dled by the abrupt and incredible 
change. Moments before the sky 
had been a vast, starry blanket of 
black velvet ; then, abruptly, he had 
been hovering over the city, sliding 
down toward warm friendly lights 
and music. He checked the proper 
switches and felt the throbbing 
purr of anti-gravs as the ship slid 
down toward the landing slot. The 
tall spires of the other ships rose 
to meet him, circle upon circle of 
silver needles in the bright landing 
place. The instrument panel 
whirred into activity as the auto- 
matics set the ship back into the 
berth from which it had risen days

before. With a sigh, Ravdin eased 
himself out of the seat, his heart 
pounding with excitement. Per- 
haps, he thought, he was too ex- 
cited, too eager to be home, for his 
mind still reeled from the fearful 
discovery of his journey. 

The station was completely 
empty as Ravdin walked down the 
ramp to the shuttles. At the desk 
he checked his fuel report in the 
shiny punchcard robot, and walked 
swiftly across the polished floor. 
The wall panels pulsed a sombre 
blue-green, broken sharply by bril- 
liant flashes and overtones of scar- 
let, reflecting with subtle accuracy 
the tumult in his own mind. Not a 
sound was in the air, not a whisper 
nor sign of human habitation. 
Vaguely, uneasiness grew in his 
mind as he entered the shuttle sta- 
tion. Then, suddenly, the music 
caught him — a long, low chord of 
indescribable beauty, rising and 
falling in the wind, a distant whis- 
per of life. The Concert, of course. 
Everyone would be at the Concert 
tonight, and even at the five-mile 
distance, the beauty of four hun- 
dred perfectly harmonized voices 
could carry to him in the breeze. 
The uneasiness disappeared, re- 
placed by an eagerness to join, to 
discharge his horrible message and 
join the others in the great amphi- 
theatre set deep in the hillside out- 
side the city. Because he knew 
everyone would be there — except 
one. Instinctively Ravdin knew 
that Lord Nehmon would be miss- 
ing the Concert, too, waiting for 
him to return. 

The shuttle slipped soundlessly 
from its berth, rising in a slow arc 
high over the edges of Jungle-land 



toward the shining walls of the city. 
Ravdin settled back, trying to clear 
his mind of the shock and horror, 
straining to catch the wisps of mu- 
sic as he crossed closer to the hill- 
side place, down into the bright 
beauty of the city. The curves and 
spires of glowing plastic passed be- 
low, and his throat tightened as he 
looked down. Very suddenly he re- 
alized that his whole life was en- 
tangled in the very beauty of that 
wonderful city, everything he had 
ever hoped or dreamed lay shel- 
tered there in the ever-clinging 
rhythm of colors and shapes and 
sounds. And now, he knew, he 
would see his beloved city burning 
once again, a consuming pyre, 
heartbreaking memorial to the age- 
old fear of his people. 

Softly the little shuttle-car 
sighed, settling down gently on the 
green terrace near the center of the 
city. The building was a master- 
piece of smoothly curving walls and 
tasteful lines, opening a full side 
to the south to catch the soft sun- 
light and warm breezes. Ravdin 
stepped onto the deep carpeting of 
the terrace. There was other music 
here, different music, a wilder, 
more intimate fantasy of whirling 
sound. An oval door opened for 
him, ushering him into the vaulted 
room. He stopped short, staggered 
for a moment by the overpowering 
beauty of the dance before him. 

A girl with flaming red hair — 
red like the color of new flame — 
dancing with enthralling beauty 
and abandon, her flowing body 
moving like ripples of wind to the 
music which filled the room with 
its throbbing cry. Her beauty was 
exquisite, every motion, every

flowing turn, a symphony of flaw- 
less perfection as she danced to the 
wild music. 

“Lord Nehmon!” 

The dancer threw back her head 
sharply, eyes wide, her body frozen 
in midair, and then, abruptly, she 
was gone, leaving only the barest 
flickering image of her fiery hair. 
The music slowed, singing softly, 
and Ravdin could see the man who 
sat in the room, looking at him. 
Nehmon rose, a tall, vital man, his 
graying hair and the strong, sad 
lines of his face belying the youthful 
movement of his body. A smile 
broke on his face, and he came for- 
ward, clapping Ravdin on the back, 
taking his hand warmly. “You’re 
too late for the Concert — it’s a 
shame. Mischana is the master to- 
night, and the whole city is 
there — ” 

Ravdin’ s throat tightened as he 
tried to smile, and his voice was 
hoarse and urgent. “They’re com- 
ing , Nehmon! I saw them, hours 
ago—” 

The last overtones of the dance 
broke abruptly, like a glass shat- 
tered on stone. The room was 
deathly still. Lord Nehmon’s eyes 
searched the younger man’s face 
for a long moment; then he turned 
away, not quite concealing the sad- 
ness and pain in his eyes. “You 
couldn’t be mistaken?” 

“No chance. I found signs of 
their passing in a dozen places. I 
saw them, their whole fleet. There 
were hundreds. They’re coming, I 
saw them.” 

“Did they see you?” Nehmon’s 
voice was sharp. 

“No, no. The Warp is a wonder- 
ful thing. With it, I can come and 



go in the twinkling of an eye. But 
I saw them in the twinkling of an 
eye.” 

“It couldn’t have been anyone 
else?” 

“Could anyone else build ships 
like the Hunters?” 

Nehmon sighed, sinking back 
into his relaxer, shaking his head. 
“No one that we know.” He 
glanced up at the scout. “Sit down, 
Ravdin, sit down. I — I’ll just have 
to rearrange my thinking a little. 
Where were they? How far?” 
Ravdin sat down facing him, his 
face drawn and pale. “Seven light 
years, Nehmon. Can you imagine 
it? Just seven, and they were com- 
ing without hesitation. They know 
where we are.” His eyes filled with 
fear. “They couldn’t have come — 
unless they have the Warp, too — ” 
The older man’s breath cut off 
sharply. There was real alarm in 
his eyes. “You’re right,” he said 
softly. “Six months ago it was eight 
hundred light years away, in an 
era completely remote from us. 
Now just seven. In six months they 
have come so close — ” 

“And there’s no confusion now. 
They know where we are — ” the 
scout looked up at Nehmon, a deso- 
late look. “What can we do? We 
have only weeks, maybe days, be- 
fore they’re here. We have no time 
to plan, no time to prepare for 
them. What can we do?” 

The room was silent. Finally the 
older man stood up, wearily, his 
six hundred years of life showing 
in his face for the first time in cen- 
turies. “We can do once again what 
we have always done,” he said sad- 
ly. “We can run away.”

T HE BRIGHT street below the 
oval window was empty and 
quiet. Not a breath of air stirred in 
the city. Ravdin stared out in 
shocked silence, hardly believing 
the words, now that he’d heard 
them. “Again”, he said dully. 
“After we have worked so hard, 
done so much — now we must burn 
the city and flee again — ” His voice 
trailed off to silence. He stared at 
Nehmon, seeking in his face some 
answer, some reassurance. He 
found no answer there, only sad- 
ness. “The Concerts — it’s taken so 
long, we’re so close to the ultimate 
goal in the Concerts — ” he gestured 
toward the thought-sensitive sound- 
ing boards lining the walls, through 
which the dancer-illusion had been 
possible — “All the beauty and 
peace we’ve found here — ” 

“I know. How well I know.” 
Ravdin’s voice became sharper. 
“Yet the Hunters come again, and 
again we must run away.” He 
stared at the old man, his eyes sud- 
denly bright. “Nehmon, I’ve been 
thinking — ” 

Nehmon looked up sharply. Not 
in alarm, but with a look of plead- 
ing, like the look of an old and 
dying man who begs to be spared 
false hope. A faint smile crossed 
his lips. “I think, too, sometimes.” 
“Not what I’ve been thinking.” 
Ravdin sat down, clasping his 
hands in excitement. “We run 
away, Nehmon. Think about that 
a moment. We run, and we run, 
and we run. From what? We run 
from the Hunters. They’re hunting 
us, these Hunters. They never quite 
find us, because we’ve already run. 
We’re clever, we’re fortunate, we 
have a way of life that they do not, 



so they’ve never found us — yet. 
Whenever they come close to find- 
ing us, we run.” 

Nehmon nodded slowly. “For 
thousands of years.” 

Ravdin’s eyes were bright. “Yes, 
we run, we cringe, we hide under 
stones, we break up our lives and 
tear up our families, we run like 
frightened animals — ” he gulped a 
breath, and his eyes sought Neh- 
mon’s, angrily. “Why do we run , 
my Lord?” 

Nehmon’s eyes widened. “Be- 
cause we have no choice,” he said 
sharply. “We must run or be killed. 
You know that, you’ve seen the 
records, you’ve been taught.” 

“Oh, yes, I’ve been taught, I 
know. I’ve been taught that mil- 
lenia ago remote ancestors of ours 
fought the Hunters, and lost, and 
fled, and were pursued — and al- 
ways ran, ran, ran. But why? Time 
after time we’ve been cornered, and 
we’ve turned and fled. Why? Even 
animals know that when they’re 
cornered they must turn and 
fight-” 

“We are not animals ” Neh- 
mon’s voice cut the air like a whip- 
lash. 

“But we could fight.” 

“Animals fight. We do not. We 
fought once, like animals, and now 
we must run from the Hunters, 
who must continue to fight like ani- 
mals. Let the Hunters fight.” 
Ravdin rubbed his lips, sinking 
back into the relaxer. “Then — the 
Hunters are not men like us,” he 
said suddenly. “That’s what you’re 
saying. They’re animals. We kill 
animals for our food, isn’t that 
true? We kill the tiger-beasts in the 
Jungle to protect ourselves. Why

not kill the Hunters to protect our- 
selves?” 

Nehmon sighed, and reached out 
a hand to the younger man. “1’m 
sorry, 55 he said gently. “It seems 
logical, but it’s false logic. No, the 
Hunters are men — men just like 
you and me. Their lives are differ- 
ent, their culture is different, but 
they are men. And human life is 
sacred, to us, above all else. This 
is the fundamental basis of our very 
existence. Without it we would be 
Hunters, too. If we fight, we are 
dead. That’s why we must run 
away now, and always. Because we 
know that we must not kill men. 55 

O N THE STREET below, the 
night air was suddenly full of 
voices, chattering , intermingled 
with whispers of song and occa- 
sional brief harmonic flutterings. 
The footfalls were muted on the 
polished pavement as the people 
passed, slowly, their voices carry- 
ing a hint of puzzled uneasiness as 
they passed. 

“The Concert’s over! 55 Ravdin 
walked to the window, feeling a 
chill pass through him. “So soon — 
something must have gone wrong. 55 
Eagerly he searched the faces pass- 
ing in the street for Dana’s face, 
sensing the lurking discord in the 
people’s quiet talk. Suddenly the 
sound-boards in the room tinkled a 
carrilon of ruby tones in his ear and 
he turned from the window. And 
then she was in the room, his new 
bride, rushing to his arms with a 
happy cry, pressing her soft cheek 
to his rough chin. “You’re back! 
Oh, I’m so glad, so very glad!” She 
turned to Lord Nehmon then, her 



face stricken. “Oh, Nehmon, if you 
could have been there tonight — it 
was horrible. There was something 
in the air. Everyone felt it — we 
knew there was something wrong, 
and the Concert was ruined. The 
people were afraid — ” 

Ravdin turned away sharply. 
“Tell her,” he said to the old man. 

Dana looked at them, her gray 
eyes widening in horror. “The 
Hunters! They’ve found us?” 
Ravdin nodded wordlessly. 

Her hands trembled as she sat 
down, and there were tears in her 
eyes. “We came so close tonight — 
so very close. I felt the music before 
it was sung, do you realize that? I 
felt the fear around me, even 
though no one said a word. It 
wasn’t vague or fuzzy, it was clear! 
The transference was perfect.” She 
turned her stunned face to the old 
man. “It’s taken so long to come 
this far, Nehmon. So much work 
and training to reach toward a per- 
fect communal Concert. We’ve 
had only two hundred years here, 
only two hundred! I was just a lit- 
tle girl when we came, I can’t even 
remember before that. Before we 
came here we were undisturbed for 
a thousand years, and before that, 
four thousand. But two hundred — 
we can 3 t leave now. Not when 
we’ve come so far.” 

Ravdin looked from Dana to the 
old man. “Closer and closer. This 
time they will catch us. Or next 
time, or the next. And that will be 
the end of everything for us, unless 
we fight them.” He paused, watch- 
ing the last groups dispersing on the 
street below. “If we only knew, for 
sure, what we were running from.” 
There was a startled silence. The 




98

girl’s breath came in a gasp and her 
eyes widened as his words sank 
home. “Ravdin,” she said softly. 
“Have you ever seen a Hunter ?” 
The couple stared at each other 
in amazement. Ravdin felt chill of 
excitement tingle his spine. Music 
burst from the sounding-board — 
odd, wild music, suddenly hopeful. 
“No,” he said, “no, of course not. 
You know that.” 

She rose from her seat, trem- 
bling. She looked at Lord Nehmon. 
“Have you ? 33 

“Never.” The old man’s voice 
was harsh. 

Dana stared at her husband. 
“Has anyone ever seen a Hunter?” 
Ravdin’s hand trembled. “I — I 
don’t know. None of us living now, 
no. It’s been too long since they last 
actually found us. I’ve read — oh, I 
can’t remember. I think my grand- 
father saw them — or my great 
grandfather — somewhere back 
there. It’s been thousands of 
years — ” 

“Yet we’ve been tearing ourselves 
up by the roots, wrenching our peo- 
ple from planet to planet, running 
and dying and still running. Sup- 
pose that we might not have to 
run?” 

He stared at her. “But they keep 
coming. They keep searching for 
us. What more proof do you need?” 
Dana’s face glowed with excite- 
ment; her slender body was alive 
with new vitality, new hope. “But 
they might have changed. Things 
can happen — look at us, how we’ve 
grown since the wars with the 
Hunters. Think how our philoso- 
phy and culture have matured! Oh, 
Ravdin, you were to be Master at a 
Concert next month. Think how 



the Concerts have changed ! Even 
my grandmother can remember 
when the Concerts were just a few 
performers playing, and everyone 
else just sitting and listening! Can 
you imagine anything more silly? 
They hadn’t even thought of trans- 
ference then, they never dreamed 
what a real Concert-communion 
could be. Why, those people had 
never tasted music, until they be- 
came a part of the music. Even we 
can see these changes — why 
couldn’t the Hunters have grown 
and changed just as we have?” 

Nehmon’s voice broke in, almost 
harshly, as he faced the excited 
pair. “The Hunters don’t have 
Concerts,” he said grimly. “You’re 
deluding yourselves. They laughed 
at our music, they scoffed at our 
arts and twisted them into mock- 
eries. They had no concept of 
beauty in their language. The 
Hunters are incapable of change.” 

“And you can say that when no- 
body has seen them for thousands 
of years?” 

Nehmon met her steady eyes, 
read the strength and determina- 
tion in their depths. He knew, des- 
pairingly, what they were thinking 
— that he was old, that he couldn’t 
understand, that his mind was 
channeled now beyond the ap- 
proach of wisdom. “You mustn’t 
think what you’re thinking,” he 
said weakly. “You’re blind. You 
wouldn’t know, you couldn’t have 
any idea what you would find. If 
you tried to contact them, you 
could be lost completely, killed, tor- 
tured. If they haven’t changed, you 
wouldn’t stand a chance. You’d 
never come back, Dana.” 

“She’s right.” Ravdin’s voice was

low in the still room. “You’re 
wrong, my Lord. We can’t continue 
this way if we’re to survive. Some- 
time our people must contact them, 
find the link that was once between 
us, and forge it strong again. We 
could do it.” 

“I could forbid you to go.” 

Dana looked at her husband, and 
her eyes were proud. “You could 
forbid us to go,” she said, facing 
the old man, “but you could never 
stop us.” 



F ROM THE edge of the Jungle- 
land a great beast watched with 
green-gleaming eyes, licking his 
fanged jaws as he watched the 
glowing city, sensing somehow that 
the mystifying circle of light and 
motion was soon to become his 
jungle again. In the city the tur- 
moil bubbled over, as wave after 
wave of the people made the short 
safari across the intervening jun- 
gle to the circles of their ships. Hus- 
bands, wives, fathers, mothers, car- 
rying their small, frail remem- 
brances out to the ships. There 
was music among them still, but it 
was a different sort of music, now, 
an eerie, hopeless music that drifted 
out of the city on the wind and 
caused all but the bravest of the 
beasts to prickle the hair on their 
backs and run in panic through the 
jungle darkness. A melancholy 
music carried from thought to 
thought, from voice to voice as the 
people of the city wearily prepared 
themselves once again for the long 
journey. 

To run away. In the darkness of 
secrecy, to be gone, without a trace, 
without symbol or vestige of their 



once proud presence, leaving only 
the scorched circle of land for the 
jungle to reclaim, so that no eyes, 
not even the sharpest, would ever 
know how long they had stayed, 
nor where they might have gone. 

In the rounded room of his 
house, Lord Nehmon dispatched 
the last of his belongings, a few re- 
membrances, nothing more, be- 
cause the ‘space on the ships must 
take people, not remembrances. He 
knew that the remembrances would 
bring only pain. All day he had 
supervised the loading, the intri- 
cate preparations, following plans 
laid down millenia before. He saw 
the libraries and records transport- 
ed, mile upon endless mile of mul- 
timicrofilm, carted to the ships pre- 
pared to carry them, stored until a 
new resting place was found. The 
history of a people was carried to 
those ships, a people once proud 
and strong, now equally proud, but 
dwindling in numbers in toll for 
the constant roving. A proud peo- 
ple, yet a people who would turn 
and run without thought, in a 
panic of age-old fear. They had to 
run, Nehmon knew, if they were to 
survive. And with a blaze of anger 
in his heart, he almost hated the 
two young people waiting with him 
for the last ship to be filled. For 
these two would not go. 

It had been a long night, a pain- 
ful night. He had pleaded and 
begged, to persuade them that 
there was no hope, that the very 
idea of remaining behind or trying 
to contact the Hunters was insane. 
Yet he knew they were sane — per- 
haps unwise, naive, but their deci- 
sion had been reached, and they 
would not be shaken. 




100 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



The day was almost gone, the 
sun sinking lower as the last ships 
began to fill. Nehmon turned to 
Ravdin and Dana, his face lined 
and tired. “You’ll have to go soon,” 
he said. “The city will be burned, 
of course, as always. You’ll be left 
with food and with weapons 
against the jungle. The Hunters 
will know that we’ve been here, but 
they’ll not know when, nor where 
we have gone. You will have to see 
that they don’t learn.” 

Dana shook her head. “We’ll tell 
them nothing, unless it’s safe for 
them to know.” 

“They’ll question you, even tor- 
ture you — ” 

She smiled calmly. “Perhaps they 
won’t. But as a last resort, we can 
blank out.” 

Nehmon’s face went white. 
“You’d never regain your memo- 
ry,” he said. That must be saved as 
a last resort.” 

Down below on the street the 
last groups of people were passing, 
the last sweet, eerie tones rising to 
the darkening room. In a few mo- 
ments the last families would have 
taken their refuge in the ships, 
waiting for Nehmon to give the 
dreaded signal to fire the plastic 
city before the ships started on their 
voyage. The Concerts were over. 
They all knew the years of aimless 
wandering in the black reaches of 
space before another home could 
be found. They knew the longer 
years of settlement and turmoil be- 
fore the Concerts could once again 
rise from their hearts and throats 
and minds, once again work toward 
the climactic expression of their 
heritage. 

Ravdin felt the desolation in the 



people’s minds, the utter hopeless- 
ness in the old man’s face, and his 
own mind reeled in sudden des- 
pair. It was such a slender hope, so 
frail and dangerous. He knew of 
the terrible fight, the war of his 
people against the Hunters, so 
many thousand thousand years be- 
fore. They had risen together, a 
common people, a single planet 
their home. And then, the gradual 
splitting of the nations, his own 
people living in peace, seeking the 
growth and beauty of the arts, hat- 
ing the bitterness and barrenness 
of war — and the Hunters, under an 
iron heel of militarism, of govern- 
ment for the perpetuation of gov- 
ernment, split farther and farther 
from them. It was an ever-widen- 
ing split as the Hunters grew to 
hate Ravdin’ s people for all the 
things the Hunters were losing: 
peace, love, happiness. Ravdin 
knew of the slowly developing doc- 
trine of the Sanctity of Life, shat- 
tered abruptly by the horrible wars, 
and then the centuries of fear and 
flight, hiding from the wrath of 
the Hunters’ vengeance. His people 
had learned much in those long 
years — they had conquered disease, 
they had grown in strength as they 
dwindled in numbers. And now 
the end could be seen, crystal clear, 
the end of his people and a ghastly 
grave. 

Nehmon’s voice broke the si- 
lence. “If you must go, then go. 
The city will burn an hour after we 
blast.” 

“We will be safe, outside the 
city.” Dana’s eyes glowed, instilling 
some fraction of her strength and 
confidence in her husband’s heart. 
“Wish us the best, Nehmon. If a 




THE LINK 



101 



link can be forged, we will do it.” 
“I wish you the best in every- 
thing.” There were tears in the old 
man’s eyes as he turned and left the 
room. 



T HEY STOOD in the jungle-land 
and heard the running animals. 
They shivered in the cool night air 
as the bright sparks of the ships’ ex- 
hausts faded into the black starry 
sky. A man and a woman, speech- 
less, watching, staring with awful 
longing into the skies, watching the. 
bright specks flicker and go out — 
Purple spumes of flame shot into 
the air from the city, throwing a 
ghastly, un-human light on the 
frightened jungle, spires of flame 
seeking the stars with their fingers 
as the plastic walls and streets of 
the city hissed and shriveled, black- 
ening, bubbling into a vanishing 
memory before their eyes. The 
flames shot high, carrying with 
them the last remnants of the city 
which had stood proud and tall an 
hour before. And then a silence fell, 
deathly, like the lifeless silence of a 
cold grave. Finally, out of the si- 
lence, little whispering sounds of 
the jungle crept to their ears, first 
frightened, then curious, then bold- 
er and bolder, as the wisps of grass 
and little animals ventured out and 
out toward the clearing where the 
city had stood. And the jungle 
gathered courage, and the clearing 
slowly, silently, began to disappear. 

And then, days later, new sparks 
of light appeared in the black sky, 
grew to larger specks, and then to 
flames, and finally settled to the 
earth on powerful, flaming jets. 



They were squat, misshapen ves- 
sels, circling down out of the air, 
hissing, screeching, landing with a 
grinding crash in the tall thicket of 
the jungle. Ravdin’s signal had 
brought the ships down, and the 
Hunters had seen them, standing 
on a hilltop where the amphithea- 
ter had been. Men had come out 
of the ship, large men with cold 
faces and dull eyes, weapons 
strapped to their trim uniforms. 
The Hunters had blinked at them, 
unbelieving, and their weapons 
were held ready. Ravdin and Dana 
were seized and led to the largest 
ship. As they approached it, their 
hearts sank and they clasped hands 
to bolster their failing hope. 

The leader of the Hunters sat 
back from his desk as they were 
thrust into the cabin. His face was 
a graven mask as he searched their 
faces dispassionately, the slightest 
hint of a sneer about his deep-set, 
thoughtful eyes. Their eyes were 
pale with fear in the bright light, 
and Frankie felt a wave of disgust 
pass through his mind. ‘‘Chickens,” 
he muttered. “We have been hunt- 
ing down chickens.” His eyes 
turned to one of the guards. “They 
have been searched?” 

“Of course, sir.” 

“And questioned?” 

The guard frowned. “Their lan- 
guage, sir, it’s almost unintelligi- 
ble.” 

“You’ve studied the basic 
tongues, haven’t you?” Frankie’s 
voice was as cold as his eyes. 

“Of course, sir, but this is very 
different — ” 

Frankie’s eyes swept contemp- 
tuously to the fair-skinned pair, and 
fixed upon their faces for a long 




102 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



moment. Finally he said, “Well?” 
Ravdin glanced briefly at Dana’s 
white face. His own voice seemed 
weak and unsteady in comparison 
to the Hunter’s grating baritone. 
“You are the leader of the Hunt- 
ers?” 

Frankie regarded them sourly, 
without replying. His thin face was 
swarthy, his short-cut grey hair 
matching the cold grey of his eyes. 
His was an odd face, completely 
expressionless, blank of any thought 
or emotion, yet capable of shifting 
to a strange biting slyness in the 
briefest instant. It was a rich face, 
a face of inscrutable depth. Sharp- 
ly he pushed his chair back, his 
eyes watchful and sharp. “We know 
your people were here,” he said 
suddenly. “Now they’ve gone and 
you’ve stayed behind.” There was 
no softness in the man’s face, only 
suspicion and distrust. “Presumably 
you had some reason for such rash- 
ness. Are you going to tell me now, 
or do you prefer to waste a few 
days of my time first?” 

Ravdin stared at him for a mo- 
ment. “My people were here, that’s 
true. We stayed to contact you, to 
tell you we want peace — ” 

Frankie’s eyes widened, almost 
startled. Then tired lines appeared 
around his eyes. “Is that all you 
have to say? Where have your peo- 
ple gone?” 

Ravdin met him eye for eye. “I 
can’t say.” 

The Hunter burst into a short 
laugh. “I’m quite sure you can. 
You don’t choose to — just now. 
Let’s be precise. Who knows, very 
soon you may wish with all your 
heart to tell me — ” 

Dana’s voice was sharp. “We 



want peace — that’s all there is to 
say. This constant hunting and run- 
ning is senseless, exhausting to both 
of us. We want to make peace with 
you, to bring our people together 
again.” 

Frankie snorted. “You came to 
us in war, once, long ago. Now you 
want peace. What would you do, 
clasp us to your bosom, to smother 
us in your idiotic music? Or have 
you gone on to greater things?” 

Ravdin’s face flushed hotly. 
“Much greater things,” he snapped. 

Frankie sat down slowly, his 
eyes betraying his anger. “Very 
soon you will be killed,” he said 
softly. “The quickness or lengthi- 
ness of your dying will be largely 
determined by the civility of your 
tongue. A civil tongue answers 
questions with the right answers. 
Now, shall we commence asking 
questions?” 

Dana stepped forward suddenly, 
her cheeks flushed. “We don’t have 
the words to express ourselves, we 
can’t tell you in words what we 
must,” she said softly. “But music 
is a language even you can under- 
stand. We could tell you what we 
want, in music — ” 

Frankie scowled. He knew the 
magic of this music, he had heard 
of the witchcraft these weak chick- 
en-people could weave, of their 
strange, magic power to steal men’s 
minds from them, to make them 
like children before wolves. Yet he 
had never heard that music, with 
his own ears — he looked up at 
them, his eyes strangely bright. 
“You know I cannot listen to your 
music,” he growled. “It’s forbid- 
den, even you should know that. 
How dare you propose — ” 




THE LINK 



103 



“But this is different music — ” 
Dana’s eyes widened suddenly, and 
she threw an excited glance at her 
husband. “Our music is beautiful, 
wonderful to hear. If you could 
only hear it — ” 

“Never.” The man looked away, 
a little light of indecision in his 
eyes. “Your music is forbidden, 
poisonous — ” 

Her smile was like sweet wine, a 
smile that worked into the Hunter’s 
mind like a gentle, lazy drug. “But 
you are the leader here,” she said. 
“And forbidden pleasures are so 
much sweeter — ” 

Frankie’s eyes were on hers, fas- 
cinated. Slowly, with a graceful 
movement, she drew the gleaming 
thought-sensitive stone from her 
clothing. It glowed in the room 
with a pearly luminescence, and 
she saw the man’s eyes turning to 
it, drawn as if by magic. Then he 
shook his head, and a cruel smile 
played about his mouth. He mo- 
tioned toward the stone. “All 
right,” he said mockingly. “Show 
me your precious music.” 

Like a tinkle of glass breaking in 
a well, the stone flashed its fiery 
light in the room. Little swirls of 
music floated suddenly into the 
barren stillness of the room. Fran- 
kie tensed, a chill running up his 
spine, unable to draw his eyes from 
the gleaming jewel. And then the 
music was there in the room, rising 
in its glorious beauty like an over- 
powering wave, filling his mind 
with strange and wonderful images. 
The stone shimmered and grew, 
and took the form of dancing 
clouds of light, swirling with the 
music as it rose. Suddenly Frankie 
felt his mind groping toward the 



music, trying desperately to reach 
into the heart of it, to become part 
of it. And Ravdin and Dana stood 
there, trancelike, staring transfixed 
at the gleaming center of light, 
forcing their joined minds into the 
crashing, majestic chords as the 
song lifted from the depths of ob- 
livion to the heights of glory in the 
old, old song of their people — 

A song of majesty, and strength, 
and dignity. A song of love, of as- 
piration, a song of achievement. A 
song of peoples driven by ancient 
fears across the eons of space, seek- 
ing only peace, seeking love, even 
the love of those who drove them. 
Frankie heard the music, and could 
not comprehend, for his mind 
could not catch the chords, the 
true overtones of that glorious 
music, but he felt the strangeness 
in the pangs of fear which groped 
through his mind, cringing from 
the wonderful strains, dazzled by 
the dancing light. And then he was 
staring at the couple, wide-eyed, 
trembling. The authority was gone 
from his face for the barest instant, 
the cruelty was gone, the avarice, 
the sardonic mockery. For the 
briefest moment his cold grey eyes 
grew incredibly tender with a sud- 
den ancient, long-forgotten long- 
ing, crying at last to be heard — 
And then, with an animal 
scream, he was stumbling into the 
midst of the light, lashing out wild- 
ly into the heart of its shimmering 
brilliance, sweeping the hypnotic 
stone with a roar into a crashing, 
ear-splitting cacophony against the 
cold steel bulkhead. He stood, his 
whole body shaking, eyes blazing 
with fear and anger, bitter hatred 
sparking from his gleaming eyes as 




104 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



he turned on Ravdin and Dana, his 
voice a raging storm of hatred in 
the dying strains of the music. 

“Spies! You thought you could 
steal my mind away, make me for- 
get my duty, make me listen to your 
rotten, poisonous noise! Well, you 
failed, do you hear? I didn’t hear 
it, I didn’t listen, 1 didn't! I’ll hunt 
you down as my fathers hunted you 
down. I’ll bring my people their 
vengeance and glory, and then your 
music will be dead!” He turned to 
the guards, wildly, his hands still 
trembling. “Take them out! Whip 
them, burn them, do anything! But 
find out where their people have 
gone. Find out! Music ! We’ll take 
the music from them, once and for 
all ” 



T HE INQUISITION had been 
horrible. Their minds had no 
concept of such horror, such in- 
sidious, racking pain. The burning 
lights, the questions screamed in 
their ears, Frankie’s vicious eyes 
burning in bitter frustrated hatred, 
and their own screams, rising with 
each question they would not an- 
swer, rising into hideous rasps until 
their throats were scorched and 
they could no longer scream. And 
then they reached the limit, and 
almost at the same instant they 
muttered the hoarse words that 
could deliver them. No words that 
Frankie could hear, but the words 
that could blank out their minds 
like a wet sponge over slate. The 
hypnotic key clicked into the lock 
of their minds, and their screams 
died in their throats. Then their 
eyes widened stupidly as their 
memories died in their brains. 



Frankie stared at them, and knew 
instantly what they had done, a 
technique of total memory oblitera- 
tion known and dreaded for so 
many thousand years that history 
could not remember. And then, as 
his prey stood mindless before him, 
he let out one hoarse, agonized 
scream, and flew into a terrible, 
roaring, flailing rage of frustration 
and defeat. 

But he did not kill them. They 
were left on a cold stone ledge, 
blinking dumbly at each other as 
the Hunter’s ships rose, one by one, 
and vanished like fireflies in the 
dark night sky. Naked, they sat 
alone. They knew no words, no 
music, nothing. And they did not 
know that in the departing ships 
the seed was planted. For Frankie 
had heard the music, he had seen 
the beauty of his enemies for that 
brief instant, and in that instant 
they had become less his enemies. 
Though he hated them now, the 
tiny, tiny seed of doubt had been 
planted. The seed would grow. 

The two sat dumbly, shivering. 
Far in the distance a beast roared 
against the heavy night, and a light 
rain began to fall. The two sat 
naked, the rain soaking their skin 
and hair, and still they sat. Then 
one of them grunted and moved 
into the dry darkness of the cave. 
Deep within him some instinct 
spoke, warned him to fear the roar 
of the animal in the distance. 

Blinking dully, the woman crept 
into the cave after him. Three 
thoughts alone filled their empty 
minds. Not thoughts of Nehmon 
and his people — to them, Nehmon 
had never existed, forgotten as 
completely as if he had never been.

No thoughts of the Hunter, either, 
nor of his unheard-of mercy in 
leaving them their lives — lives of 
memoryless oblivion, like animals 
in this green Jungle-land, but life — 
Only three thoughts filled their 
minds : 



It was raining. 

They were hungry. 

The saber-tooth was wandering 
tonight. 

They never knew that the link 
had been forged.

and MacCullogh heard him mutter 
just before he disappeared alto- 
gether, “I will, if I ever see her 
again!” 

MacCulloch turned to stare at 
the platform and Decker turned to 
follow his gaze. A sudden dizziness 
overcame them both and there was 
a slight haze about the auditorium. 
When it cleared, the podium was 
empty. Mrs. Johns-Hayes was gone 
as if she had never been. 

“My God!,” the professor gasped. 
“I was afraid something like this 
might happen. He must have mar- 
ried the other girl.” 



“I suppose,” Decker said quietly, 
“that we should consider ourselves 
lucky that he didn’t decide to go 
back to Pennsylvania.” His voice 
broke off and he wondered what he 
had been saying. He looked up at 
the speakers’ platform trying to re- 
member why he should think it 
strange that it was draped in Union 
Jacks and that Lady Appleby- 
Simpkin should be saying, “And 
now, my dears, I know that all of 
you, as Loyal Daughters of the 
British Empire will be happy to 
know . .”

Personalities in Science 



Nature and Nature’s Laws lay 
hid in night, 

God said, “Let Newton be!” 
and there was light. 

— Pope. 

T O REALIZE what Newton’s 
discoveries mean to us, let us 
look back a little into the minds of 
the men of several centuries ago. In 
those days they recognized a certain 
order of things beneath nature’s 
confusion — such as the fact that 
the sun rises in the east and sets in 
the west, that summer and winter 
and day and night follow one an- 
other, that objects always fall to the 
ground when released in mid-air. 
But all these things were accepted 
without explanation. The nature of 
light, heat, sound and electricity 
were unknown; chemistry was still 
befogged with alchemy, and astron- 
omy with astrology. The farthest 
outposts were the discoveries of 
Galileo and Keppler in astronomy, 
mechanics and optics. Such was the 
intellectual world into which Isaac 
Newton was born on Christmas 
morn in the year 1642 in Wool ton- 
shire, England. 

Until he made the momentous 
decision that he would beat the 
school bully both mentally and 
physically, he was an extremely 
poor student. His interests lay in 



inventing clever devices rather 
than in the study of Greek and 
Latin. Among his childhood inven- 
tions were such things as a small 
windmill that would grind wheat 
and corn, a water clock run by the 
force of dropping water, a sundial, 
which still stands today on the wall 
of the house in which he was born, 
and very practical doll’s house fur- 
niture. 



A T FOURTEEN he was taken 
from school to help his wid- 
owed mother run the farm. He 
spent so much time at reading that 
he was of absolutely no use on the 
homestead at all and it was decided 
that he be sent to the University. 
Here he was a profound student 
and an excellent scientist, so eager 
to learn that he often read ahead 
on his own hook and completely as- 
tonished his teachers by knowing 
his subject fully and completely be- 
fore the school year had really 
started. 

His devotion to the study of 
mathematics led him to discover a 
new method of calculus — or, as he 
called it, fluxions — which was to 
prove invaluable and was later to 
enable him to prove his law of grav- 
itation. A curious sidelight on this 
particular discovery is that the 
great Leibnitz seems to have dis- 
covered this same method at about 
the same time; and publication by

Newton was met with bitterness by 
the German who accused Newton 
of having stolen the idea from him. 
The controversy raged all their 
lives and had such a deep effect on 
Newton that he became extremely 
reluctant about publishing his find- 
ings. He became so sensitive to criti- 
cism that his friends had to beg him 
to publish his work. Writing to a 
friend, he said, “I see that a man 
must either resolve to put out noth- 
ing new, or to become a slave to 
defend it.” 

The story of the apple is one that 
every school child learns long be- 
fore he really understands what 
gravity means. As a test to prove 
his theory, Newton calculated the 
orbit of the moon, and the motion 
as he figured it agreed “pretty 
nearly” with the known facts. But 
to him “pretty nearly” was as bad 
as not at all — and since he could go 
no further with it at the time, he 
laid gravitation aside for a while. 

Now he began to tinker with 
light and color. By 1669 he demon- 
strated the compound character of 
light and the fact that color re- 
sides not in the object, but in the 
light itself. Newton explained light 
by the corpuscular theory — that 
light is caused by a stream of mi- 
nute particles given off at a high 
velocity by a luminous body. This 
was later rejected by scientists as 
the one place where Newton really 
had gone wrong. The undulatory 
theory, in which light traveled in 
waves, became the accepted theory. 
But since the discovery of radium 
and radioactivity have proved the 
existence of minute particles mov- 
ing at high speeds, we’re not so sure 
now that he was completely wrong 



on this point. 

In 1684, the astronomer Halley 
stumbled on the fact that Newton 
had (after seven years of inactivity 
on the subject) picked up his 
theory of gravitation again. That 
he had in fact worked out in soli- 
tude the principle of his theory. 
He had satisfied himself and with 
his usual reticence about “advertis- 
ing” had absolutely no desire to tell 
the world about it. Halley nagged 
and begged and pleaded until New- 
ton finally set down the elements 
of his findings in his “Principia.” 
It is said there weren’t 12 men in 
Europe able to understand this 
book at the time of its publication 
in 1687. 



A T ABOUT that time a new 
facet of the personality that 
was Isaac Newton came to the fore. 
Through the despotic meddling of 
King James II, who desired to 
bring Catholicism into power in 
England, force was brought against 
the University of Cambridge to 
grant a degree to a monk of ex- 
tremely low capabilities. The uni- 
versity refused. When King James 
threatened to close the school, 
Newton was called from his studies 
to lend his abilities and prestige to 
a committee that had been formed 
to combat this encroachment. His 
activities in this cause resulted in 
his election to a seat in Parliament, 
which he held for two years. While 
he held the seat he was a keen and 
active participant in the promotion 
of public welfare and used it to 
seek official encouragement for in- 
ventors and young men of science. 
The development of the chro- 




108 



PERSONALITIES IN SCIENCE 



nometer devised by John Harrison 
was largely due to his generous in- 
terest and inspiration. 

In 1696 he was appointed war- 
den of the mint, being regarded as 
particularly suited to the post, not 
only because of his reputation as a 
mathematician, but especially as a 
metallurgist because of his many 
experiments with alloys for making 
telescope mirrors. A reformation in 
coinage was taking place at the 
time and Newton was able to be 
particularly helpful. Two years 
later he was made Master of the 
Mint, which position he held for 
the rest of his life and which as- 
sured him a comfortable old age. 

This shorter than average, rather 
stout little man hardly seemed to 
have stature enough to be pre- 
possessing, yet he stood a giant 
among men dedicated to scientific 
investigation. 



T ODAY Newton’s theory of grav- 
itation has been questioned. 
Einstein has rejected his explana- 
tion, though not the fact of its 
operation. But all science admits 
that the Englishman laid the foun- 
dations on which Einstein built his 
theory of relativity. The “Princi- 
pia” has been called the greatest 
single contribution to science ever 
made by one man. It established 
the ideas of mass and force, the 
principal of mechanics of the heav- 
enly bodies and the science of theo- 



retical mechanics as it exists today. 
Newton’s improved methods of cal- 
culation placed knowledge and 
achievement on a basis of mathe- 
matical precision. The spectrum 
analysis of white light paved the 
way for a host of useful optical dis- 
coveries and inventions. He orig- 
inated the mathematical basis for 
all of modern physics. For isolated 
facts he substituted a rule of law. 
He invented the first reflector tele- 
scope and widened the scope of the 
entire Universe for us. With these 
universal laws Newton brought or- 
der into chaos, knowledge out of 
superstition. 

After being knighted, Isaac was 
able to retire and continue his work 
with more ease — if a man such as 
he ever could take things easy. A 
hackney, three beautiful horses and 
a home presided over by a gay and 
charming sister provided all the 
ease he wanted. Despite criticism 
of his “notions, 55 he had literally 
hundreds of friends. He was charm- 
ing, witty and serene — and calm 
beyond belief. With all this he was 
so modest that he never considered 
himself at all important in the field 
of science — he preferred to think 
of himself as the eternal “tinkerer.” 
Fie always maintained that his 
achievements were those of “ — a 
little boy picking up a few pebbles 
on the beach; while all around lay 
the boundless sea of undiscovered 
knowledge.”

Man knows he is the forerunner of a finer and more perfect race; and his

The HOLES and JOHN SMITH 

By Edward W. Ludwig 

Illustration by Kelly Freas 




I T ALL BEGAN on a Saturday 
night at The Space Room . If 
you’ve seen any recent Martian 
travel folders, you know the place: 
“A picturesque oasis of old Mar- 
tian charm, situated on the beau- 
teous Grand Canal in the heart of 
Marsport. Only half a mile from 
historic Chandler Field, landing 
site of the first Martian expedition 
nearly fifty years ago in 1990. A 
visitor to the hotel, lunch room or 
cocktail lounge will thrill at the 
sight of hardy space pioneers min- 
gling side by side with colorful 
Martian tribesmen. An evening at 
The Space Room is an amazing, 
unforgettable experience.” 

Of course, the folders neglect to 
add that the most amazing aspect is 
the scent of the Canal’s stagnant 
water — and that the most unforget- 
table experience is seeing the “root- 
of-all-evil” evaporate from your

pocketbook like snow from the 
Great Red Desert. 

We were sitting on the bandstand 
of the candle-lit cocktail lounge. 
Me — Jimmie Stanley — and my 
four-piece combo. Maybe you’ve 
seen our motto back on Earth: 
“The Hottest Music This Side of 
Mercury.” 

But there weren’t four of us to- 
night. Only three. Ziggy, our bass 
fiddle man, had nearly sliced off 
two fingers while opening a can of 
Saturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing 
the number of our personnel by a 
tragic twenty-five per cent. 

Which was why Ke-teeli, our 
boss, was descending upon us with 
all the grace of an enraged Venus- 
ian vinosaur. 

“Where ees museek?” he shrilled 
in his nasal tenor. He was almost 
skeleton thin, like most Martians, 
and so tall that if he fell down he’d 
be half way home. 

I gulped. “Our bass man can’t 
be here, but we’ve called the Mars- 
port local for another. He’ll be here 
any minute.” 

Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to 
as Goon-Face and The Eye, leered 
coldly down at me from his eight- 
foot-three. His eyes were like black 
needle points set deep in a mask of 
dry, ancient, reddish leather. 

“Ees no feedle man, ees no job,” 
he squeaked. 

I sighed. This was the week our 
contract ended. Goon-Face had dis- 
played little enough enthusiasm for 
our music as it was. His comments 
were either, “Ees too loud, too fast,” 
or “Ees too slow, too soft.” The real 
cause of his concern being, I sus- 
pected, the infrequency with which 
his cash register tinkled. 



“But,” I added, “even if the new 
man doesn’t come, we’re still here. 
We’ll play for you.” I glanced at 
the conglomeration of uniformed 
spacemen, white-suited tourists, 
and loin-clothed natives who sat at 
ancient stone tables. “You wouldn’t 
want to disappoint your customers, 
would you?” 

Ke-teeli snorted. “Maybe ees bet- 
ter dey be deesappointed. Ees better 
no museek den bad museek.” 

Fat Boy, our clarinetist who dou- 
bles on Martian horn-harp, made a 
feeble attempt at optimism. “Don’t 
worry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass 
man will be here.” 

“Sure,” said Hammer-Head, our 
red-haired vibro-drummer. “I think 
I hear him coming now.” 

Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the 
entrance. There was only silence. 
His naked, parchment-like chest 
swelled as if it were an expanding 
balloon. 

“Five meenutes!” he shrieked. 
“Eef no feedle, den you go!” And 
he whirled away. 

We waited. 

Fat Boy’s two hundred and 
eighty-odd pounds were drooped 
over his chair like the blubber of an 
exhausted, beach-stranded whale. 

“Well,” he muttered, “there’s al- 
ways the uranium pits of Neptune. 
Course, you don’t live more than 
five years there — ” 

“Maybe we could make it back 
to Lunar City,” suggested Hammer- 
Head. 

“Using what for fare?” I asked. 
“Your brains?” 

Hammer-Head groaned. “No. I 
guess it’ll have to be the black pits 
of Neptune. The home of washed- 
up interplanetary musicians. It’s too 




THE HOLES AND JOHN SMITH 



111 



bad. We’re so young, too.” 

The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli 
was casting his razor-edged glare in 
our direction. I brushed the chewed 
finger nails from the keyboard of 
my electronic piano. 

Then it happened. 



F ROM THE entrance of The 
Space Room came a thumping 
and a grating and a banging. Sud- 
denly, sweeping across the dance 
floor like a cold wind, was a bass 
fiddle, an enormous black monstros- 
ity, a refugee from a pawnbroker’s 
attic. It was queerly shaped. It was 
too tall, too wide. It was more like 
a monstrous, midnight-black hour- 
glass than a bass. 

The fiddle was not unaccompa- 
nied as I’d first imagined. Behind 
it, streaking over the floor in a 
waltz of agony, was a little guy, an 
animated matchstick with a flat, 
broad face that seemed to have 
been compressed in a vice. His sand- 
colored mop of hair reminded me 
of a field of dry grass, the long 
strands forming loops that flanked 
the sides of his face. 

His pale blue eyes were watery, 
like twin pools of fog. His tight- 
fitting suit, as black as the bass, 
was something off a park bench. It 
was impossible to guess his age. He 
could have been anywhere between 
twenty and forty. 

The bass thumped down upon 
the bandstand. 

“Hello,” he puffed. “I’m John 
Smith, from the Marsport union.” 
He spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if 
anxious to conclude the routine of 
introductions. “I’m sorry I’m late, 
but I was working on my plan.” 



A moment’s silence. 

“Your plan?” I echoed at last. 

“How to get back home,” he 
snapped as if I should have known 
it already. 

Hummm, I thought. 

My gaze turned to the dance 
floor. Goon-Face had his eyes on 
us, and they were as cold as six In- 
dians going South. 

“We’ll talk about your plan at 
intermission,” I said, shivering. 
“Now, we’d better start playing. 
John, do you know On An Asteroid 
With You ? >3 

“I know everything said John 
Smith. 

I turned to my piano with a 
shudder. I didn’t dare look at that 
horrible fiddle again. I didn’t dare 
think what kind of soul-chilling 
tones might emerge from its ancient 
depths. 

And I didn’t dare look again at 
the second monstrosity, the one 
named John Smith. I closed my 
eyes and plunged into a four-bar 
intro. 

Hammer-Head joined in on 
vibro-drums and Fat Boy on clari- 
net, and then — 

My eyes burst open. A shiver 
coursed down my spine like gigan- 
tic mice feet. 

The tones that surged from that 
monstrous bass were ecstatic. They 
were out of a jazzman’s Heaven. 
They were great rolling clouds that 
seemed to envelop the entire uni- 
verse with their vibrance. They 
held a depth and a volume and a 
richness that were astounding, that 
were like no others I’d ever heard. 

First they went Boom-de-boom- 
de-boom-de-boom , and then, boom- 
de-de- boom -de-de- boom -de-de- 




112 



EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



boom , just like the tones of all bass 
fiddles. 

But there was something else, too. 
There were overtones, so that John 
wasn’t just playing a single note, 
but a whole chord with each beat. 
And the fullness, the depth of those 
incredible chords actually set my 
blood tingling. I could feel the 
tingling just as one can feel the vi- 
bration of a plucked guitar string. 

I glanced at the cash customers. 
They looked like weary warriors 
getting their first glimpse of Val- 
halla. Gap-jawed and wide-eyed, 
they seemed in a kind of ecstatic 
hypnosis. Even the silent, bland- 
faced Martians stopped sipping 
their wine-syrup and nodded their 
dark heads in time with the rhythm. 

I looked at The Eye. The trans- 
formation of his gaunt features 
was miraculous. Shadows of gloom 
dissolved and were replaced by 
a black-toothed, crescent-shaped 
smile of delight. His eyes shone like 
those of a kid seeing Santa Claus. 

We finished On An Asteroid With 
You, modulated into Sweet Sally 
from Saturn and finished with 
Tighten Your Lips on Titan . 

We waited for the applause of 
the Earth people and the shrilling 
of the Martians to die down. Then 
I turned to John and his fiddle. 

“If I didn’t hear it,” I gasped, 
“I wouldn’t believe it!” 

“And the fiddle’s so old, too!” 
added Hammer-Head who, al- 
though sober, seemed quite drunk. 

“Old?” said John Smith. “Of 
course it’s old. It’s over five thou- 
sand years old. I was lucky to find 
it in a pawnshop. Only it’s not a 
fiddle but a Zloomph. This is the 
only one in existence.” He patted 



the thing tenderly. “I tried the hole 
in it but it isn’t the right one.” 

I wondered what the hell he was 
talking about. I studied the black, 
mirror-like wood. The aperture in 
the vesonator was like that of any 
bass fiddle. 

“Isn’t right for what?” I had to 
ask. 

He turned his sad eyes to me. 
“For going home,” he said. 

Hummm, I thought. 



E PLAYED. Tune after tune. 
John knew them all, from the 
latest pop melodies to a swing ver- 
sion of the classic Rhapsody of The 
Stars. He was a quiet guy during 
the next couple of hours, and get- 
ting more than a few words from 
him seemed as hard as extracting a 
tooth. He’d stand by his fiddle — I 
mean, his Zloomph — with a dreamy 
expression in those watery eyes, 
staring at nothing. 

But after one number he studied 
Fat Boy’s clarinet for a moment. 
“Nice clarinet,” he mused. “Has an 
unusual hole in the front.” 

Fat Boy scratched the back of 
his head. “You — you mean here? 
Where the music comes out?” 

John Smith nodded. “Unusual.” 
Hummm, I thought again. 
Awhile later I caught him eye- 
ing my piano keyboard. “What’s 
the matter, John?” 

He pointed. 

“Oh, there,” I said. “A cigarette 
fell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole 
in the key. If The Eye sees it, he’ll 
swear at me in seven languages.” 
“Even there,” he said softly, 
“even there. 

There was no doubt about it. 





THE HOLES AND JOHN SMITH 



113 



John Smith was peculiar, but he 
was the best bass man this side of a 
musician’s Nirvana. 

It didn’t take a genius to figure 
out our situation. Item one: Goon- 
Face’s countenance had evidenced 
an excellent imitation of Mephisto- 
pheles before John began to play. 
Item two: Goon-Face had beamed 
like a kitten with a quart of cream 
after John began to play. 

Conclusion : If we wanted to 
keep eating, we’d have to persuade 
John Smith to join our combo. 

At intermission I said, “How 
about a drink, John? Maybe a shot 
of wine-syrup?” 

He shook his head. 

“Then maybe a Venusian fizz?” 
His grunt was negative. 

“Then some old-fashioned beer?” 
He smiled. “Yes, I like beer.” 

I escorted him to the bar and as- 
sisted him in his arduous climb on- 
to a stool. 

“John,” I ventured after he’d 
taken an experimental sip, “where 
have you been hiding? A guy like 
you should be playing every night.” 
John yawned. “Just got here. Fig- 
ured I might need some money so 
I went to the union. Then I worked 
on my plan.” 

“Then you need a job. How 
about playing with us steady? We 
like your style a lot.” 

He made a long, low humming 
sound which I interpreted as an 
expression of intense concentration. 
“I don’t know,” he finally drawled. 

“It’d be a steady job, John.” In- 
spiration struck me. “And listen, I 
have an apartment. It’s got every- 
thing, solar shower, automatic chef, 
’copter landing — if we ever get a 
’copter. Plenty of room there for 



two people. You can stay with me 
and it won’t cost you a cent. And 
we’ll even pay you over union 
wages.” 

His watery gaze wandered lazily 
to the bar mirror, down to the glit- 
tering array of bottles and then out 
to the dance floor. 

He yawned again and spoke 
slowly, as if each word were a lead- 
en weight cast reluctantly from his 
tongue : 

“No, I don’t . care much . 
about playing.” 

“What do you like to do, John?” 

His string-bean of a body stif- 
fened. “I like to study ancient his- 
tory . and I must work on my 
plan.” 

Oh Lord, that plan again! 

I took a deep breath. “Tell me 
about it, John. It must be interest- 
ing.” 

He made queer clicking noises 
with his mouth that reminded me 
of a mechanical toy being wound 
into motion. “The whole founda- 
tion of this or any other culture is 
based on the history of all the time 
dimensions, each interwoven with 
the other, throughout the ages. And 
the holes provide a means of study- 
ing all of it first hand.” 

Oh, oh, I thought. But you still 
have to eat . Remember , you still 
have to eat. 

“Trouble is,” he went on, “there 
are so many holes in this universe.” 

“Holes?” I kept a straight face. 

“Certainly. Look around you. All 
you see is holes. These beer bottles 
are just holes surrounded by glass. 
The doors and windows — they’re 
holes in walls. The mine tunnels 
make a network of holes under the 
desert. Gaves are holes, animals live 




114 



EDWARD W. LUDWIG 



in holes, our faces have holes, 
clothes have holes — millions and 
millions of holes!” 

I winced and thought, humor 
him because you gotta eat, you 
gotta eat. 

His voice trembled with emotion. 
“Why, they’re everywhere. They’re 
in pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket 
jets, in bumpy roads. There are but- 
tonholes and well holes, and shoe- 
lace holes. There are doughnut 
holes and stocking holes and wood- 
pecker holes and cheese holes. 
Oceans lie in holes in the earth, 
and rivers and canals and valleys. 
The craters of the Moon are holes. 
Everything is — ” 

“But, John,” I said patiently as 
as possible, “what have these holes 
got to do with you?” 

He glowered at me as if I were 
unworthy of such a confidence. 
“What have they to do with me?” 
he shrilled. “I can’t find the right 
one — that’s what!” 

I closed my eyes. “Which particu- 
lar hole are you looking for, John?” 
He was speaking rapidly again 
now. 

“I was hurrying back to the Uni- 
versity with the Zloomph to prove 
a point of ancient history to those 
fools. They don’t believe that in- 
struments which make music ac- 
tually existed before the tapes! It 
was dark — and some fool researcher 
had forgotten to set a force-field 
over the hole — I fell through.” 

I closed my eyes. “Now wait a 
minute. Did you drop something, 
lose it in the hole — is that why you 
have to find it?” 

“Oh I didn’t lose anything im- 
portant,” he snapped, “just my own 
time dimension. And if I don’t get 



back they will think I couldn’t prove 
my theory, that I’m ashamed to 
come back, and I’ll be discredited.” 
His chest sagged for an instant. 
Then he straightened. “But there’s 
still time for my plan to work out — 
with the relative difference taken 
into account. Only I get so tired 
just thinking about it.” 

“Yes, I can see where thinking 
about it would tire any one.” 

He nodded. “But it can’t be too 
far away.” 

“I’d like to hear more about it,” 
I said. “But if you’re not going to 
play with us — ” 

“Oh, I’ll play with you,” he 
beamed. “I can talk to you. You 
understand.” 

Thank heaven! 



H EAVEN LASTED for just three 
days. During those seventy- two 
golden hours the melodious tinkling 
of The Eye’s cash register was as 
constant as that of Santa’s sleigh 
bells. 

John became the hero of tourists, 
spacemen, and Martians, but nev- 
ertheless he remained stubbornly 
aloof. He was quiet, moody, playing 
his Zloomph automatically. He’d 
reveal definite indications of be- 
longing to Homo Sapiens only when 
drinking beer and talking about his 
holes. 

Goon-Face was still cautious. 
“Contract?” he wheezed. “May- 
be. We see. Eef feedleman stay, we 
have contract. He stay, yes?” 

“Oh, sure,” I said. “He’ll stay — 
just as long as you want him.” 

“Den he sign contract, too. No 
beeg feedle, no contract.” 

“Sure. We’ll get him to sign it.” 




THE HOLES AND JOHN SMITH 115 



I laughed hollowly. “Don’t worry, 
Mr. Ke-teeli.” 

Just a few minutes later tragedy 
struck. 

A reporter from the Marsport 
Times ambled into interview the 
Man of The Hour. The interview, 
unfortunately, was conducted over 
the bar and accompanied by a gen- 
erous guzzling of beer. Fat Boy, 
Hammer-Head and I watched 
from a table. Knowing John as we 
did, a silent prayer was in our eyes. 

“This is the first time he’s talked 
to anybody,” Fat Boy breathed. 
“I — I’m scared. 

“Nothing can happen,” I said, 
optimistically. “This’ll be good pub- 
licity.” 

We watched. 

John murmured something. The 
reporter, a paunchy, balding man, 
scribbled furiously in his notebook. 

John yawned, muttered some- 
thing else. The reporter continued 
to scribble. 

John sipped beer. His eyes 
brightened, and he began to talk 
more rapidly. 

The reporter frowned, stopped 
writing, and studied John curiously. 

John finished his first beer, 
started on his second. His eyes were 
wild, and he was talking more and 
more rapidly. 

“He’s doing it,” Hammer-Head 
groaned. “He’s telling him!” 

I rose swiftly. “We better get 
over there. We should have known 
better — ” 

We were too late. The reporter 
had already slapped on his hat and 
was striding to the exit. John turned 
to us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanish- 
ing like air from a punctured bal- 
loon. 



“He wouldn’t listen,” he said, 
weakly. “I tried to tell him, but he 
said he’d come back when I’m 
sober. I’m sober now. So I quit. 
I’ve got to find my hole.” 

I patted him on the back. “No, 
John, we’ll help you. Don’t quit. 
We’ll — well, we’ll help you.” 
“We’re working on a plan, too,” 
said Fat Boy in a burst of inspira- 
tion. “We’re going to make a more 
scientific approach.” 

“How?” John asked. 

Fat Boy gulped. 

“Just wait another day,” I said. 
“We’ll have it worked out. Just be 
patient another day. You can’t 
leave now, not after all your work.” 
“No, I guess not,” he sighed. “I’ll 
stay — until tomorrow.” 

A LL NIGHT the thought crept 
through my brain like a teasing 
spider: What can we do to make 
him stay ? What can we tell him? 
What, what, what? 

Unable to sleep the next morn- 
ing, I left John to his snoring and 
went for an aspirin and black cof- 
fee. All the possible schemes were 
drumming through my mind : find- 
ing an Earth blonde to capture 
John’s interest, having him electro- 
hypnotized, breaking his leg, forg- 
ing a letter from this mythical uni- 
versity telling him his theory was 
proved valid and for him to take 
a nice long vacation now. He was 
a screwball about holes and force 
fields and dimensional worlds but 
for that music of his I’d baby him 
the rest of his life. 

It was early afternoon when I 
trudged back to my apartment. 
John was squatting on the living

room floor, surrounded by a forest 
of empty beer bottles. His eyes were 
bulging, his hair was even wilder 
than usual, and he was swaying. 
“John!” I cried. “You’re drunk!” 
His watery eyes squinted at me. 
“No, not drunk. Just scared. I’m 
awful scared!” 

“But you mustn’t be scared. That 
reporter was just stupid. We’ll help 
you with your theory.” 

His body trembled. “No, it isn’t 
that. It isn’t the reporter.” 

“Then what is it, John?” 

“It’s my body. It’s — ” 

“Yes, what about your body? 
Are you sick?” \ 

His face was white with terror. 
“No, my — my body’s full of holes. 
Suppose it’s one of those holes! 
How will I get back if it is?” 

He rose and staggered to his 
Zloomph , clutching it as though it 
were somehow a source of strength 
and consolation. 

I patted him gingerly on the arm. 
“Now John. You’ve just had too 
much beer, that’s all. Let’s go out 
and get some air and some strong 
black coffee. G’mon now.” 

We staggered out into the morn- 
ing darkness, the three of us. John, 
the Zloomph , and I. 

I was hanging on to him trying 
to see around and over and even 
under the Zloomph — steering by a 
sort of radar-like sixth sense. The 
street lights on Marsport are pretty 
dim compared to Earthside. I 
didn’t see the open manhole that 
the workmen had figured would be 
all right at that time of night. It 
gets pretty damned cold around 4: 
A.M. of a Martian morning, and I 
guess the men were warming up 



with a little nip at the bar across 
the street. 

Then — he was gone. 

John just slipped out of my grasp 
— Zloomph and all — and was gone 
— completely and irrevocably gone. 
I even risked a broken neck and 
jumped in the manhole after him. 
Nothing — nothing but the smell of 
ozone and an echo bouncing crazily 
off the walls of the conduit. 

“ — is it. — is it. — is it. — is it.” 

John Smith was gone, so utterly 
and completely and tragically gone 
it was as if he’d never existed. 

Tonight is our last night at The 
Space Room. Goon-Face is scowl- 
ing again with the icy fury of a 
Plutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face 
has said, “No beeg feedle, no con- 
tract.” 

Without John, we’re notes in a 
lost chord. 

We’ve searched everything, in 
hospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs, 
hotels. We’ve hounded spaceports 
and ’copter terminals. Nowhere, no- 
where is John Smith. 

Ziggy, whose two fingers have 
healed, has already bowed to what 
seems inevitable. He’s signed up for 
that trip to Neptune’s uranium 
pits. There’s plenty of room for 
more volunteers, he tells us. But I 
spend my time cussing the guy who 
forgot to set the force field at the 
other end of the hole and let John 
and his Zloomph back into his own 
time dimension. I cuss harder when 
I think how we were robbed of the 
best bass player in the galaxy. 

And without a corpus delecti we 
can’t even sue the city.

What Is Your Science I.Q.? 

NOT SO very long ago atoms were comparatively unknown to 
the lay public, now every science fiction aficionado, including the 
kids who love space suits and ray guns, knows about them. The 
intrepid reader is also learning about a lot of other things in and 
out of this world — both fact-wise and fiction-wise. See how many 
of the questions below you can answer. Then check your score on 
page 119 and see how wise you are in the ways of science and 
science fiction. Counting 5 for each correct answer, here’s how you 
rate: 100 — good; 110 — very good; 120 — excellent. 



GROUP 1 

1. What is the name of the proc- 
ess that uses two or more 
combined atoms to release 
energy. 

2. What is the name of the man 
who was the first to success- 
fully smash the atom?

rings, but how many moons 
has it? 

7. What is the term used to refer 
to the growing of food in 
chemical compounds. 

8. What American is credited

known senses? 

12. What do we call a luminous 
heavenly body that has a tail 
and follows a fixed orbit 
around the sun? 



GROUP 2 (True or False?) 

1. Gamma rays are waves of pure 
energy. 

2. The Great Nebula is a mass of 
luminous gas in the constella- 
tion Orion than can be seen 
with the naked eye. 

3. Wolf I is a fixed star. 

4. Light travels at a speed of 
186,000 miles per minute. 

5. An android is a mechanical 
device made to resemble a 
man. 

6. When two dissimilar organ- 
isms live together in close 

•union it is called symbiosis. 

7. Plutonium is a natural ele- 
ment found in the earth. 

8. A parsec is a unit of astro- 
nomical length equal to 19.2 
trillion miles. 

9. Parthenogenesis is a process of 
reproduction through union of 
a sperm and an ovum.

process of disintegration in an 
atom that is unstable. 

13. The atmospheric pressure on 
earth is about 15 pounds per 
square foot. 

14. Mare Crisium is the name 
astronomers have given to the 
largest crater of the moon 
visible to the naked eye. 

15. A light year is equal to 
6,000,000,000,000 miles. 





Sun Cookery — Indian scientists 

have perfected a food cooker that 
utilizes solar energy as fuel. With 
a mirror four feet wide, this cooker 
weighs about thirty pounds and is 
more than adequate for an average 
size family. It sells for about $14 — 
and is being manufactured at the 
rate of about 1,000 per month. 
Sounds good, but we’ll hang onto 
our old gas stove for the rainy sea- 
son. 

Mail Rockets — What the postage 
will cost is anybody’s guess, but 
rocket experts are predicting that 
by 1978 we will be receiving first 
class mail by rockets. Advances in 
the science of guided missiles indi- 
cate that a letter posted in New 
York (E.S.T.) will arrive approxi- 
mately 36 minutes later in San 
Francisco (P.S.T.) When this time 
is halved, which they will undoubt- 
edly do, your friend can read your 
letter in San Francisco before you 
write it in New York! Figure it out. 

T.V. Bomb Demolition — At the 

Army Ordnance Depot in Oregon, 
bombs of all types are now disas- 
sembled safely with the aid of a 
T.V. camera. The operator who 
works the motor driven disassem- 
bling machine sits in a bomb-proof 
shelter and watches the entire 

1 



operation on a receiver. The cam- 
era is focused on all moving parts 
and the operator can stop work im- 
mediately after noting any signs of 
danger. Safe but it probably tops all 
other shows for suspense effects! 

X-Ray 'Tooth-picks" — Wooden ap- 
plicator sticks with radioactive 
cesium for the “heads” will replace 
bulky X-ray equipment now used 
by dentists. This “tooth-pick” held 
against the jaw or tooth, either in- 
side or outside the mouth, will pro- 
duce a picture on an X-ray film 
packet held in the appropriate posi- 
tion. 

Missile "Brains" — Two small but 
high speed computers, lightweight 
enough for air-borne control of 
guided missiles, were revealed re- 
cently. Nine different devices feed 
information into the computers. 
After digesting the information and 
solving the control problems, the 
“brain” takes over by controlling 
the flight mechanism. The actual 
use to which this computer will be 
put is still a military secret. 

Skull "Pie" — Skull surgeons will 
now be required to be “bakers” too. 
A Washington doctor has per- 
fected a plastic dough which, when 
kneaded and rolled, can be molded 
into the skull depression to replace 
metal plates now used for such re- 
pairs. More form-fitting and a bet- 
ter insulator than metal, this plastic 
won’t perforate the skin and is far 
less expensive than metal. The 
“pie” is mixed, fitted, hardened 
and sterilized right in the operating 
room. Less than twenty minutes are 
required for the whole process.

Fish "Radar"— A new deep-sea 
echo-sounding device which can 
sweep back and forth as well as 
straight down and so “see’ 5 in any 
direction will soon take most of the 
guesswork out of commercial fish- 
ing. With this gadget fishermen can 
locate a school of fish, note it’s size, 
direction and speed and lower nets 
before they reach the vicinity. A 
pocket-sized edition would help 
eliminate all those tales of “the one 
that got away”. 

Prospecting '54 Style — Using mass 
production techniques that would 
daze a forty-niner, the govern- 
ment’s uranium prospecting doesn’t 
guarantee results but, rather, sup- 
plies uranium-hunters with leads to 
potential deposits, leaving it to in- 
dividuals to work the areas over. 

The basic technique is for a low 
flying plane carrying a scintillation 
detector — a sort of super Geiger 
counter — to fly over measured strips 
in a given area. Any reaction on 
the detector is marked on a paper 
tape and a 35-mm. camera 
mounted on the tail of the plane 
maps the area at the same time. 
The air prospectors work in teams, 
with a D.C. 3, flying at about 500 
feet, and mapping up to 600 square 
miles a day. Then, the second crew, 
flying a little Piper Cub, flys over 
the area at a much lower altitude 
to get more accurate readings. The 
aerial maps gathered in this way, 
with the potential deposits clearly 
marked, are then posted in offices 
of the Department of the Interior 
and Atomic Energy Commission. 

That the program has been 
helpful is indicated by the A.E.C. 
report that three-fourths of the 
newly opened uranium deposits in 



the Black Hills of South Dakota 
have been located by this aerial 
exploration method. With pay- 
ment of $1.50 a pound for ore 
containing 1/10 of 1 per cent 
uranium to $3.50 a pound for 2/10 
of 1 per cent, plus the extra bonus 
on delivery to the A.E.C., there 
is a host of small-time prospectors 
hoping to strike it rich in this 
government sponsored prospecting 
business. 

Flying Blinds — “Flying Venetian 
blinds” are likely to pop up in the 
news soon. Army tests of a plane 
with slatted wings have proved ex- 
tremely promising. With such 
equipment a fast transport can take 
off vertically from a “pocket hand- 
kerchief” field. 

Robot Arms — The “little wonder 
robot arm” that can bake a cake 
and pour your tea is right around 
the corner. It exists right now, but 
a gross weight of 15 tons makes it a 
little impractical. Patience Ladies, 
the day will come.

Shades of Dick Tracy — The wrist 
radio is coming closer and closer 
for everybody’s use. The latest 
model uses five transistors instead 
of vacuum tubes, and can pick up 
broadcasts from as far away as 65 
miles. 

Underwater "Mountain Climbing" 

—Mountaineers of the future may 
be climbing underwater mountains. 
Recent ocean surveys show canyons 
as deep as Grand Canyon and 
mountains of gigantic proportions 
under the Pacific Ocean. 

Insects Beware! — Those insects 
that have learned to resist D.D.T. 
take warning. A new insecticide 
that is 100 times more powerful, yet 
non poisonous to man or animals, 
has been developed. We’re not 
licked yet. 

Salt-Water Fresh Water — Resi- 
dents in low-rainfall areas won’t 
have to worry too much about wa- 
ter conservation in the future. Heat 
from atomic fuels is being visual- 
ized as the agent for distilling fresh 
water from the ocean in quantities 
huge enough to serve every need. 

Bomb-Radiation-Proof Concrete — 

If contractors should receive stand- 
ing orders to mix barite with con- 
crete, there will be an excellent 
reason. Tests have shown that such 
a combination helps buildings with- 
stand bomb blasts and protects the 
occupants from radiation. 



"Shock Treatment" — Even an 
electronic brain can become cranky 
or difficult, and when the comput- 
ers display such human failings en- 
gineers in charge of them treat 
them much the same way a psychia- 
trist would treat a human patient 
with a personality maladjustment. 

First a rest (a complete stop- 
page) is prescribed. Then a slow 
resumption of operation is ordered, 
quite often this sort of brief “rest- 
cure” is all the “cranky” machine 
may need. If this “vacation” doesn’t 
work, the next step is a shock 
treatment of sorts. Sometimes a 
swift kick on the part of the en- 
gineer will be “shock” enough. If 
it isn’t, then the kind of treatment 
now used on stubborn mental cases 
is used. Just as the application of 
high voltage electricity often shocks 
the patient back to normality, so 
the “brain” often responds to a 
sudden over-voltage charge, and 
the mechanism may be set to work- 
ing again. 

If all this sort of treatment still 
doesn’t bring about a cure of the 
balky computer, engineers resort to 
their version of surgery. This means 
tearing out one or more parts and 
repairing or replacing them. Of 
course, there is an added advan- 
tage to this sort of surgery over 
the human kind, the “patient” 
needs no post operative care and 
can go back to the business at 
hand immediately. 



LOOKING AHEAD to the July issue of IF . JAMES GUNN, who is no 
stranger to science fiction readers, has written one of those really exciting 
and suspenseful stories for which he is noted. The title is A MONSTER 
NAMED SMITH — another outstanding novelette in a fine issue filled 
with exceptionally good science fiction. 




SOLAR POWER PLANTS — Giant power plants such as these are installed 
at a point where they will receive constant sunlight. The entire project 
hinges on these plants for they will convert the sun's rays into heat and 
electrical power needed in all construction and maintenance work. The semi- 
spherical building in the lower right is a prefabricated shelter unit which 
will house workmen and scientists until the larger, all-functioning housing 
unit is completed. (In the July issue: Moon base in operation.)
