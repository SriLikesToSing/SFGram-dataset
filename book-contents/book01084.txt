PUZZLES FOR PLOTTERS 



Vj^HAT makes a good science- 
fiction writer? Well, we can 
kick that one around all day, but 
most of us will agree on one thing: 

It takes what the late Alfred 
Korzybski called an ability to 
think “out of categories” — that is, 
to take the whole body of human 
learning, history, education and 
experience and contemplate it 
from outside. 

Ex-servicemen will remember 
the battery of tests they were 
given upon induction — tests to 
discover knowledge and abilities, 
but also tests to discover in what 
areas each new recruit could be 
expected to do well if he had the 
training. We recently came across 
a couple of child’s riddles that led 
us to some distinctly non-childish 
areas of speculation, and might 
even have something to do with 
the “out of categories” sort of 
mental processes we were talking 
about. Maybe they might show 
whether you yourself can be a 
science-fiction writer! 

These are the riddles: 

1. The word ax (or axe) can be 
spelled with either two or three let- 
ters. It can, however, always be 
spelled with two letters, neither of 
which is “A” or “X” or “E.” What 
are those two letters? 



2. Rearrange the letters in the 
words “new door” to make one 
word. 

Have you figured out the an- 
swers yet? It’s worthwhile to take 
a moment to do so before going 
on. 

Present these riddles to some- 
one of at least reasonable intel- 
ligence (who has never heard 
them before, of course) and you 
learn something about the way 
he thinks. There are three main 
lines of attack possible in trying 
to solve them. 

The first is what you might 
call the “electronic computer” 
method. It is laborious, me- 
chanical, repetitious, boring . 
and quite infallible, providing all 
the information is accessible. 
(And providing that the instruc- 
tions are programmed correctly 
— that is, that the question is 
“fair.”) 

It would work something like 
this, on the first riddle: The ma- 
chine reaches into its memory 
banks and discovers that there are 
twenty-six letters in the alphabet. 
Three of them are excluded by 
the rules — A, X and E. The ma- 
chine then systematically pairs 
each unexcluded letter with every 
other unexcluded letter: 



PUZZLES FOR PLOTTERS 



5 



B — B 
B — C 
B — D 
B — F 

and so on. It then scans each pair 
and compares it with, say, an una- 
bridged dictionary to see if by 
any chance one of them spells 
the word “axe.” Of course, none 
of them does. It then lights up 
its red “reject” panel and waits, 
humming sulkily, for a “fair” 
question. 

Or it might not get that far. It 
might merely compare the first 
statement with the second state- 
ment, decide that they are mu- 
tually contradictory (which they 
are!), and refuse to play at all. 

(A similar program might be 
tried on the second riddle. Solv- 
ing it “like a computer” would 
mean constructing a table of all 
the permutations of the seven 
characters in the words “new 
door” — an even longer, and just 
as fruitless, job.) 

^ I ''HIS is a method that can be 
used to carry pi to a million 
decimals, predict the lunar eclip- 
ses of the year 1,001,961 A.D. or 
chart the behavior of nuclear 
particles — but it isn’t worth beans 
for solving riddles. And it isn’t 
much good for plotting a science- 
fiction story either. 

A really sophisticated computer 
— or a fairly bright human being 
— would not bother with it. Or if 



he did try the laborious method 
and found it didn’t work, he 
would then re-examine the basic 
premisses. He would conclude the 
question wasn’t “fair.” What this 
assumption then requires is to 
analyze all the statements for 
“catches” — for example, a failure 
to distinguish between the use of 
“language” — i.e., the use of words 
to describe things — and “meta- 
language” or the use of words to 
describe symbols for things. 

He would then restate the ques- 
tions to show such distinctions. In 
written English we use a conven- 
tion of quotation marks to distin- 
guish words-that-refer-to-words 
and words-that-refer-to-things, 
which means that we need only 
to repunctuate the questions. 
However, to make them clearer 
we should also drop out the un- 
necessary, merely dust-in-the-eye 
information, which is included 
only to confuse our thinking. 

The revised riddles then come 
out like this: 

1. “It” can ... be spelled with 
two letters . What are those two let- 
ters? 

2. Rearrange the letters in the words 
“new door” to make “one word.” 

The answers to those two ques- 
tions are just about instantly ap- 
parent to any human being over 
the age of eight — provided they 
have not previously seen the 
same problems in their tricked-up 



6 



GALAXY 



form. But it’s interesting to note 
that a sizeable fraction of the 
human race can’t answer those 
questions at all if they’ve seen 
the other form first! (If you are 
one such, the answers are re- 
spectively “I-T” and “O-N-E 
W-O-R-D.”) It seems that they 
learn all too easily. Merely see- 
ing the questions stated in a con- 
fusing way sticks in their minds 
to such a degree that a pattern 
of confusion persists even after 
the confusion has been removed. 

Now this (as far as we know; 
maybe Bell or IBM has gone a 
step farther than they’ve told us) 
is a bit beyond the power of the 
average computer. It is also be- 
yond the power of many humans. 
What it comes down to is being 
asked a question by the universe 
and getting at the truth by chang- 
ing the question. This is a writer’s 
job — any writer. He has to take 
the facts of the world as they 
exist and shuffle them around to 
invent a new “plot” in order to 
tell us his story, or “answer.” 

But a science-fiction writer goes 
even a step farther. 

Vj^E actually tried the ques- 
tions out on a couple of 
science-fiction writers. 

One of them barely glanced at 
the first riddle, then set down two 
quick scribbles: In his phonetic 
shorthand, the vowel “A” and the 
double consonant “X” are each 



written with one character. We 
objected: “We meant letter of the 
English alphabet.” He said: “You 
didn’t say so!” 

The other answered the second 
riddle. He came up with the word 
“O’Rowned,” and defined it as, 
“The state of having been sub- 
jected to a process named after 
a Mr. O’Rown, as in ‘macadamed’ 
(a road), ‘Hoovered’ (a floor), 
etc.” We were about to object 
that we didn’t mean coined words 
— but there, too, we hadn’t said 
so! 

And there is the third method 
of solution. The first was to 
operate according to the appar- 
ent rules; the second to deduce 
what the framers of the rules 
meant . and the third is to 
deduce new rules, or expansions 
of rules, for yourself. 

If the first is that of the ma- 
chine and the second that of the 
writer, then the third is that of 
the science-fiction writer. It is up 
to him to tell us not what things 
are like but what they might be 
like if different conditions ob- 
tained — say, in the future; or in 
paratimee; or on another planet. 

He cannot change the ques- 
tions that are asked of him. But 
he can change the basic postulates 
that lie behind the questions. 

In other words, when the uni- 
verse asks him a cheating riddle 
— he cheats back!

One stranger was a god 



the other a devil. 



Strange that they should be on the same side! 






By FRED SABERHAGEN 

Illustrated by FINLAY 

D uring the weeks that the 
starship Yuan Chwang had 
hovered in close observa- 
tion of the new planet Aqua, 
ship’s time had been jockeyed 
around to agree with the sun- 
time at the place chosen for first 
landing. 

Boris Brazil saw no evidence 
of sane thinking behind this pro- 
cedure; it meant the planeteer’s 
briefing for the big event was set 
for 0200, and he had to get up in 
what was effectively the middle 
of the night — a thing to which he 
had grown accustomed, but never 
expected to learn to enjoy. Leav- 
ing his tiny cabin in a state of 
disorder that might have infu- 
riated an inspecting officer — had 
there been an inspecting officer 
aboard interested in the neatness 
of cabins — he set forth in search 
of chow. 

Brazil was tall and bony, re- 
sembling a blond young Abe Lin- 
coln. He rubbed sleep from his 
eyes as his long legs carried him 
toward the mess hall. A distract- 
ing young squab from Computing 
sailed past him in the opposite 
direction, smiling. 

“Good luck,” she said. 

“Is the coffee that bad?” It was 
the best facsimile of a joke he 
could think of this early. 



9 




But the girl hadn’t been talk- 
ing about coffee. Chief Planeteer 
Sam Gates had picked Brazil to 
go along on the first landing at- 
tempt, he learned when he met 
Gates in the chow line. He saw 
by the small computer clipped 
to Sam’s belt that the other man 
had been up early on his own, 
double-checking the crew chief 
and maintenance robots who 
were readying their scoutship. 
Brazil felt vaguely guilty — but 
not very. He might well have 
been just another body in the 
way. 

Sam Gates stood in the chow 
line swinging his arms and snap- 
ping his fingers, chewing his dark 
mustache as he usually did when 
nervous. 

“How’s it look?” Brazil asked. 

“Oh, free and clear. Guess we’ll 
have ground under our feet in a 
few hours.” 

ll/TOST of the Yuan Chwang’s 
^^■*-twenty-four planeteers were 
in the chow line, with a fair num- 
ber of people from other depart- 
ments. The day’s operation was 
going to be a big one for every- 
body. 

Trays loaded with S5mthetic 
ham, and a scrambled substance 
not preceded or followed by 
chickens. Gates and Brazil found 
a table. Ten scoutships were going 
down today, though only one 
would attempt to land; most of 



the night shift from all depart- 
ments seemed to think it time for 
lunch. The mess was filling up 
quickly. 

“Here comes the alien,” said 
Gates, gesturing with his fork. 

Brazil raised his eyes toward 
the tall turbaned man bearing a 
tray in their direction. 

“Hi, Chan. Pull up a chair.” 

Chandragupta was no more an 
alien here than any other Earth- 
man; his job had earned him the 
nickname. 

“Good morning,” said the Tri- 
bune with a smile, sitting down 
with Gates and Brazil. “I hop>e 
my people treat you well today.” 
He had not yet seen one of “his 
people” and possibly never 
would; but from the moment 
high-altitude reconnaissance had 
established that intelligent life at 
an apparently primitive techno- 
logical level existed on Aqua, his 
job had taken on substance. He 
was to represent the natives be- 
low in the councils aboard the 
Yuan Chwang, to argue for what 
he conceived to be their welfare 
at every turn, letting others worry 
about the scientific objectives 
that had brought the exploration 
ship so far from Earth, until he 
was satisfied that the natives 
needed no help or the mission was 
over. 

“No reason to expect any 
trouble,” said Brazil. “This one 
looks fairly simple.” 



10 



GALAXY 



“Except we know there are 
some kind of people down there,” 
said Gates. “And people are 
never as simple as you’d like 
them to be.” 

“I wonder if they will need my 
help,” said Chan, “and I wonder 
if I will be able to help them.” 
The job of Tribune was a new 
one, really still experimental. 
Chan shrugged. “But there is no 
point in my speculating now. In a 
few hours perhaps I will know.” 
“We’re not trying to conquer 
them, you know,” said Brazil, half 
amused and a little offended by 
Chan’s eagerness to defend 
against Earth a people he had 
never seen. 

“Oh, I know. But we must be 
sure not to conquer them by ac- 
cident, eh?” Chan attacked his 
ersatz eggs again. 

When Brazil got up to walk 
without Gates, he could feel the 
eyes on his back, or thought he 
could. Here go the heroes, he 
thought. First landing. Hail, hail. 

And deep inside he felt a pride 
and joy so fierce he was em- 
barrassed to admit it to him- 
self — to be one of the first 
Earthmen stepping onto this un- 
known world. 

TJRIEFING was normal for a 
mission this size. The twenty 
planeteers who were going down 
into atmosphere, plus two reserve 
crews, slouched in their seats and 



scribbled notes and smoked and 
whispered back and forth about 
business, concentrating so intently 
on the job at hand that an out- 
sider might have thought them 
bored and distracted. 

Captain Dietrich, boss of the 
Yuan Chwang, mounted the low 
dais in the front of the briefing 
-room. He was a rather small man, 
of mild and bookish appearance. 
After working with him for a 
while, you tended to treat cau- 
tiously all small men of mild 
and bookish appearance. 

Tribune Chandragupta entered 
the briefing room through the 
rear door. The Captain eyed him 
thoughtfully. This was the first 
voyage on which he had been 
required to carry a Tribune; the 
idea had been born as a political 
move in the committee meetings 
of Earth Parliament, and had 
earned certain legislators repu- 
tations as defenders of liberty, 
albeit only the liberty of certain 
as yet unmet aliens. 

Captain Dietrich had no wish 
to conquer anyone, having of 
course passed the Space Force 
psych tests, and he was willing 
to give the Tribune system a 
trial. After all, he could always 
overrule the man, on condition 
he thought it necessary for the 
safety of members qjf the expedi- 
tion — though he was the only one 
aboard who could do so. But it 
seemed to the Captain that this 



PLANETEER 



11 



placing of a civilian official aboard 
his ship might be only the 'start 
of an effort by the groundbound 
government to encroach upon the 
domain of the Space Force. Every 
time he went home he heard com- 
plaints that the SF was growing 
too powerful and cost too much. 

“Militarism,” they would say, 
over a drink or anywhere he met 
civilians. “We’ve just managed to 
really get away from all that on 
Earth, and now you want to start 
all over, on Mars and Ganymede 
and this new military base on 
Aldebaran 2.” 

“The Martian Colony is hardly 
a military base,” he would remind 
them patiently. “It now has its 
own independent civilian govern- 
ment and sends representatives to 
Earth Parliament. The Space 
Force has practically pulled out 
of Mars altogether. Ganymede is 
a training base. Aldebaran 2 
you’re right about, mostly; and 
we do have other military bases.” 

“Aha! Now how do we know 
that none of these outlying bases 
or colonies will ever threaten 
Earth?” 

“Because all spaceships and 
strategic weapons are controlled 
by the SF, and the SF is con- 
trolled by the psych tests that 
screen people trying to enter it. 
Admittedly, no system is perfect, 
but what are our alternatives?” 

“We could destroy all strategic 
weapons,” they might say. Or: 



“We could cut down on this space 
exploration, maybe stop it alto- 
gether. It’s devilish expensive, and 
there seems no hope it will ever 
relieve our crowding on Earth. 
What do we get out of it any- 
way that makes it really profit- 
able?” 

“Well,” Captain Dietrich might 
say, “since you talk of militarism, 

I will ignore the valuable knowl- 
edge we have gained by explora- 
tion, and answer you in military 
terms. We have the ability to 
travel hundreds of light-years in 
a matter of months, and to melt 
any known planet in minutes, with 
one ship delivering one weapon. 
How many other races do you 
think live in our galaxy with 
similar capabilities?” 

1^0 Earthman had met any but 
^ ' primitive aliens — yet. But 
people had begun to compre- 
hend the magnitude of the galaxy, 
where man’s hundred-light-year 
radius of domination gave him no 
more than a Jamestown Colony. 

“Assume a race with such capa- 
bilities,” the Captain might con- 
tinue, “and with motivations we 
might not be able to understand, 
spreading out across the galaxy 
as we are. Would you rather 
have them discover our military 
base on Aldebaran this year, or 
find all humanity crowded on 
one unprotected Earth, perhaps 
the year after next?” 



12 



GALAXY 



Dietrich got a wide range of 
answers to this question. He him- 
self would much prefer to meet 
the hypothetical advanced aliens 
a thousand light-years or more 
from Earth, with a number of 
large and effective military bases 
in between. 

But right now it was time for 
him to start briefing his planet- 
eers, who probably knew as much 
about Aqua as he, who had never 
driven a scoutship into her upper 
atmosphere. 

“Gentlemen, we’ve found out a 
little about this planet, the only 
child of a Sol-type sun, after 
watching it for six weeks. One 
point one AU from its sun, gravity 
point nine five, diameter point 
nine, eighty-five per cent of sur- 
face is water. Oxy-nitrogen at- 
mosphere, about fifteen thousand 
feet equivalent. We won’t try 
breathing it for some time yet. 
Full suits until further notice. 

“What land there is is probably 
quite well populated with what 
we think are humanoids with a 
technical level probably nowhere 
higher than that of medieval 
Europe. Several rather large sail- 
ing ships have been spotted in 
coastal waters. There are only 
a couple of long paved roads, 
and none of the cities are elec- 
trically lit on nightside. We don’t 
think anyone down there can 
have spotted us yet.” 

Most of his audience looked 



back at him rather impatiently, 
as if to say: We know all this. 
We’re the ones who found it out. 

But the Captain wanted to 
make sure they all had the basic 
facts in proper focus. “The main 
objective of this mission is to 
make a first contact with the 
natives with the purpose of find- 
ing a way to establish a tempo- 
rary scientific base on the sur- 
face, to continue our investiga- 
tion here with seismic studies, 
biological studies, and so forth — 
and of course to see what we can 
learn from and about the intelli- 
gent inhabitants.” 

^■"'HE Captain raised his eyes 
and spoke as much to the 
Tribune as to his planeteers. 
“There seems very little chance 
of any permanent colony being 
established here, due to the 
inadequate air, and the native 
population on a very limited land 
area. This same apparently high 
population would seem to pre- 
clude any chance of establishing 
our temporary base in some re- 
mote area, without knowledge of 
the natives. So we will have to 
deal with them somehow from 
the start. 

“I’ve never believed in the god- 
from-the-sky approach, and you 
know SF policy is to avoid it if 
possible. It injects a false note 
into what may become a per- 
manent relationship, even if we 



PLANETEER 



13 



intend it now to be temporary. 
And he who takes godhood upon 
himself is likely to have to spend 
more time at it than at the busi- 
ness for which he came, and to 
assume responsibility for far- 
reaching changes in the native 
history. 

“We’ve met enough primitive 
races to know that some change 
is bound to result from any con- 
tact, but SF policy is to keep it 
at a minimum and to try to make 
it beneficial.” 

The Captain paused, then 
looked at another man who stood 
waiting to speak, paper in his 
hand. “Meteorology?” 

“Roger, sir.” 

On a wall appeared a photo- 
map of the island that had been 
picked for the first landing 
attempt, an irregular shape of 
land about a hundred miles long 
by ten wide. Air temperature at 
dawn in the landing area should 
be about fifty degrees F, the water 
a little cooler. There might be 
enough fog to aid the landing 
scoutship in an unseen descent. 

Meteorology also discussed 
characteristics of the atmosphere 
that might affect radio and video 
communication between scouts 
and mother ship, and predicted 
the weather in the landing area 
for the next twenty-four hours. 
He paused to answer a couple of 
questions, and introduced Pas- 
sive Detection. 



The PD man discussed Aqua’s 
Van Allen belts, magnetic field, 
the variety and amount of solar 
radiation in nearby space and 
that to be expected on the sur- 
face, and what the natives prob- 
ably burned for heat and light in 
the nightside cities. He confirmed 
the apparent absence of any 
advanced technology below. 

Biology was next, with a pre- 
diction that the island would 
show diverse and active life. It 
was near the tropics in the spring 
hemisphere, and green with vege- 
tation. Scout photos showed no 
evidence of very large animals or 
plants. Some areas appeared to 
be under cultivation. 

Anthropology took the dais to 
speculate. The people of Aqua 
were thought to be humanoid, 
but in the photos anything as 
small as a man was at the very 
limit of visibility, and the estimate 
of the creatures’ appearance was 
based on lucky shots of dawn or 
dusk shadows striding gigantic 
across more or less level ground. 
Inhabitants of such a watery 
world would be expected to be 
sailors, and indeed ships had been 
photographed. There was some 
massive construction, probably 
masonry, in the one sizable city 
on the island. A sea wall and a 
couple of large structures had 
been built on a finger of land 
that protected the city’s small 
harbor.

^APTAIN Dietrich came back 
^ to outline the patterns he 
wanted the non-landing scouts to 
fly. “The target island is pretty 
well isolated from the planet’s 
main land areas, so if we put a 
base here it should have minimal 
effect on native culture. Also, if 
we botch things up here, we may 
be able to move on and try again 
without the natives in the new 
spot having heard of us.” He 
looked around at his men; the 
idea was strcmgly conveyed to 
them that the Captain preferred 
they not botch things up. “Chan 
— anything you want to say? 
No? All right, board your scouts.” 

Brazil strode beside Gates out 
the door in the rear of the brief- 
ing room, passing under the sign 
that read: 

MAYBE . ANYTHING 

Maybe they’re real telepaths 
down there. Maybe they’re a 
mighty race now retired from ac- 
tive competition and preferring 
the simple life. Maybe . 

Maybe nothing, Brazil told 
himself, quick-stepping beside 
Sam Gates along the corridor past 
the doors of scoutship berths that 
occupied this part of the hull of 
the Yuan Chwang. The time was 
for the planeteer’s motto: Go 
Down and Find Out. 

The main preflight check had 
been run yesterday. Gates and 



Brazil now faced the final quick 
Medical 8s Psych in the corridor. 
Brazil had long since given up 
trying to startle the psych doc by 
giving to the inevitable weird 
question an even weirder answer. 

“I’d swear you were sane if I 
didn’t know you better,” the doc- 
tor told him this time. “Pass on.” 

They fitted themselves into the 
suits of armor, light, space and 
ground, that had been selected 
for this job. The suits included 
among their accessories flotation 
bubbles that when inflated en- 
abled the wearers to maneuver 
with supposed ease through sev- 
eral hundred feet of water. The 
suits now received a quick semi- 
final test. 

Captain Dietrich was waiting 
in the berth that was almost filled 
by the fifty-foot-long stubby bulk 
of scoutship Alpha. Gates and 
Brazil juggled checklists and fish- 
bowl helmets to offer him each 
an armored paw to shake. The 
captain said something about 
good luck. 

The two planeteers climbed 
through the scout’s hatch, twist- 
ing sideways with practiced 
movements to meet the ninety- 
degree shift in artificial gravity 
between mother ship and scout. 
Gates climbed on toward the 
control room while Brazil stayed 
to seal the hatch. On planet they 
would of course use an airlock. 

Engines started. Ship’s power

off and disconnected. All person- 
nel out of berth. Ready for steri- 
lizing. 

Lethal gas, swirling around the 
scout’s hull, was mostly pumped 
away to be saved and reused. 
Then a blast of ultraviolet, more 
intense than the raw Sol-type sun- 
shine outside, bathed the inside 
of the berth. No microorganisms 
must be carried down into atmos- 
phere. 

STRAPPED and clamped into 
^ control room chairs, ports 
sealed, watching the tiny world of 
the berth by video screen. Gates 
and Brazil were nearly ready. 
The berth door slid open on 
schedule, and what was left of 
gas inside went out in a faint 
puff of sudden mist. 

The watery world that some- 
one with little imagination had 
named Aqua, ten thousand miles 
away, filled the opening. A quar- 
ter of it was dayside, blue-black 
as a fluorescent bruise; nightside 
was eerie with subtle atmospheric 
glows. 

“Stand by one. Alpha,” came 
over the radio. “A little trouble 
clearing Delta.” 

“Roger,” said Sam Gates. “Hey, 
Boris, I like those video stories 
at home. The guy just drives his 
ship up to a new planet and lands. 
The faithful crew stands around 
scratching their heads. ‘Well, 
what’ll we do now?’ says 



one. Then they wait for some 
hero to speak up.” 

“ ‘Let’s get out and look 
around,’ ” said Brazil, grinning. 
“ ‘O.K., but let’s all be careful. 
Maybe we better close the door 
of the ship after us.’ ” 

Sam gave a rare smile. “Then 
one shmoe takes his h°1met off 
to eat a coconut. Only it turns 
out to be a chieftain’s daughter.” 
“And they’re all in the soup. 
They never seem to learn.” 
“Stand by. Alpha,” said Oper- 
ations over the radio, unneces- 
sarily. 

Gates pointed to the slim vol- 
ume wedged under an arm of 
Brazil’s chair, secured, like every- 
thing else aboard, against some 
possible overloading or failure of 
the artificial gravity on the com- 
ing flight into the unknown. 
“What’s the book this time?” 
“Thoreau. I thought I might 
need some philosophy if you get 
us stuck in the mud for a couple 
days down there.” 

“Always meant to read the old 
nature lover through some day.” 
Gates nodded at the screens show- 
ing the waiting planet. “Wonder 
what he would have thought of 
all this.” 

Brazil looked at the Passive 
Detection screen, where the im- 
age of the planet showed the 
dawnline creeping imperceptibly 
across upper atmosphere as a 
rainbow of varying ionization

and light pressure. He smiled at 
a sudden recollection. “Ha. May- 
be he wouldn’t’ve been so sur- 
prised as you might think.” He 
quoted: “Walden Pond — let’s 
see — ‘A field of water betrays 
the spirit that is in the air. It is 
continually receiving new life 
and motion from above ... I see 
where the breeze dashes across 
it by the streaks or flakes of 
light. It is remarkable that we 
can look down on its surface. We 
shall, perhaps, look down thus 
on the surface of air at length, 
and mark where a still subtler 
spirit sweeps over it.’ ” 

“He wrote that in the middle 
of the nineteenth century?” asked 
Gates, astonished. “Let me see 
that book when you’re done with 
it.” 

“You’re clear for takeoff. Al- 
pha. Good luck,” said the radio. 

Scoutship Alpha outraced the 
dawnline by an hour to the island 
and eased down on schedule, 
without hurry, into thicker and 
thicker air, until it entered pre- 
dawn darkness and fog. Gates 
used his radar for the first time, 
to work his way down toward the 
water a quarter of a mile off the 
rocky coastline. 

Aqua was Brazil’s ninth new 
planet, but I won’t forget this 
one, he thought in some corner 
of his brain not used for watch- 
ing and interpreting screens. 

And he was right. 



■'HE plan called for an offshore 
landing unseen by the na- 
tives, the concealment of the 
scoutship in about a hundred feet 
of water as near land as possible, 
and the going ashore of Gates 
and Brazil in protective suits to 
make contact with the local in- 
telligent life. Tight-beam com- 
munication was to be maintained 
at all times with the Yuan 
Chwang. A small video eye rode 
above each planeteer’s left ear; 
whatever the eye saw was trans- 
mitted to the mother ship. 

The versatile and roughly 
humanoid robot that accompa- 
nied every scoutship (following 
men onto new planets but never 
leading them) would be left in 
the submerged scout, and would 
bring it to the human crew if 
they summoned it by radio. 

The Y uan Chwang was not 
orbiting Aqua, but hovering and 
trying to keep its quarter-mile- 
diameter bulk invisible, ten thou- 
sand miles above the island. The 
other scouts were cruising in up- 
per atmosphere in the general 
area of the target island, observ- 
ing what they could. The plan 
might be altered or abandoned at 
any step at the Chief Planeteer’s 
discretion, or by order from 
above. 

Detection screens picked out 
what looked to Brazil like the in- 
fra-red pattern of smoldering 
fires and fainter body heats of 



PLANETEER

a small village where the recon 
photos had shown a village to 
be. Gates worked the scout by 
radar to an offshore point half 
a mile from the village, which lay 
on the shore of a small cove. He 
dipped the scout low enough to 
put a sonar probe under water 
and get a picture of the bottom. 

“Nothing strange down there,” 
said Gates. “We’ll go ahead.” 

Cutting in automatic stabili- 
zers, he lowered the scout into 
and through choppy water and 
made slowly toward shore, while 
Brazil studied the ocean and bot- 
tom, trying to read half a dozen 
presentations at once. 

Near the rocky upthrust of 
land. Gates let the little ship 
settle gently down onto sandy 
bottom. He summoned the robot 
and told it to use enough drive 
to prevent sinking into the bot- 
tom. The robot got into the pilot’s 
seat as the humans checklisted 
themselves into helmets, out of 
the control room, and into the 
lock. They stood with legs spread 
and arms raised while gas and 
UV sterilized their suits and the 
chamber. 

Gates nodded and Brazil 
opened a valve to let alien sea 
into the lock; in a few seconds 
they stepped out of the world 
of checklists and into dark water. 
Brazil lingered to feel that the 
lock door was secured behind 
them, let gas into his flotation 



bubbles, and followed Gates up 
through the darkness. Once some- 
thing like a luminous smokering 
curled greenly past them through 
the water. 

“Can you bliphate the distance 
phlooh that?” asked a voice from 
the Yuan Chwang, half-strangled 
by transmission through space, 
air, and water. 

“Hard to say; I’d guess only a 
few yards,” Gates answered, wait- 
ing until his head had broken 
surface and he had taken a look 
around. Brazil was right behind 
him; he could barely see Gates’ 
helmet above the water ten feet 
away. The rough rock face of the 
coastline was only a vaguely 
deeper darkness at one side. They 
paddled toward it; waves sloshed 
them against it; they gripped it 
and began to climb. 

‘C’ARTHMEN emerged onto 
the land of a new world, 
looking more like primeval lung- 
fish than conquering demigods. 

They climbed rock uncertainly 
and slowly and halted at the 
top of a small gentle cliff. 
The suits were engineered for 
easy movement and reasonable 
comfort for twenty-four contin- 
uous sealed-in hours in almost 
any environment. Old planeteers 
sometimes said soberly that they 
needed a suit on to feel comfort- 
able but they usually preferred 
to take the suit off before sitting

r 



down to discuss. How comfort- 
ably they wore it. 

“Wait for a little more light,” 
said Gates’ radio voice. 

Brazil sat down beside a large 
rock and tried to see what was 
on the inland slope away from 
the cliff. 

The sun was not far below the 
hilly horizon now and a gray pre- 
dawn light made the scene gradu- 
ally intelligible. A faint excuse 
for a road wandered along a few 
yards away, roughly paralleling 
the shoreline; it might be a cattle 
path that led toward the village. 
Beyond the road were fields with 
a semi-cultivated look, holding 
orderly rows of squat bushes 
above a mat of low-growing vines 
that seemed to cover most of the 
ground in sight. Green hills rose 
beyond the fields. 

The dawn brightened slowly. 
To Brazil, sunrises always 
brought awe, whether he saw 
them on an outworld or on 
crowded Earth, or across the red 
deserts of the world to which his 
parents had emigrated and where 
he had been born. Sitting on this 
alien rock with sea water drip- 
ping from his armor and his hand 
on a gunbutt, he thought: First 
Landing; it’s like a First Morn- 
ing. Let there be light. 

“Light enough,” said Gates. 
“Let’s get started.” 

They walked on crunching 
vines to the road, heads swiveling 



constantly and air microphones 
tuned to high sensitivity. Brazil 
caught himself listening for the 
ape howling that had accompa- 
nied each new morning on his 
last new planet. It wasn’t good to 
carry such mental baggage when 
stepping into an unknown en- 
vironment. He would have to un- 
load it. 

They paced along the faint 
road toward the village. The hard- 
packed brownish soil of the road 
showed no trace of whatever 
traveled here. 

“Smoke ahead,” said Gates 
suddenly. It was a barely visible 
thin vertical tracery in the sky, 
rising not far away. 

The road curved around a 
craggy little hill; when they had 
rounded this, the village was be- 
fore them. Large rowboats were 
beached on the sand of a small 
sheltered cove. Forty or fifty 
yards back from the water stood 
about twenty huts, built mainly 
from what looked like mats of 
the groundvine. A small stream 
trickled through the village, flow- 
ing from the direction of a struc- 
ture like a low fortress, beyond 
the huts and much larger than 
any of them. Its dark walls of 
mud or clay or stone were sur- 
rounded by a considerable space 
cleared of all vegetation. 

Brazil turned his head to one 
side and saw his first native. His 
stomach went cold and he said 



PLANETEER

to Gates: “On the rock up there. 
Look.” 

native was undoubtedly 
humanoid and had apparently 
been dead a long time. He was 
bound somehow with vines to 
the crag that almost overhung 
the road, ten or fifteen feet above 
the Earthmen, and around his 
neck hung a placard that looked 
like cardboard, bearing a short 
inscription in bold characters 
resembling Arabic. He had been 
a tall man in life, by Earthly 
standards, and long strands of 
pale hair were still in evidence. 

“Get this?” asked Gates of the 
observers in the sky. 

“Roger. You’re going on?” 
“Don’t see why not.” 

“We never mind these ‘No 
Trespassing’ signs,” said Brazil, 
with an attempt at flippancy he 
didn’t feel. Dead men were 
nothing new to him, but this one 
had a considerable resemblance 
to himself, and had, so to speak, 
sneaked up on him. 

There were no living people 
yet in sight, but there were shrill 
cries in the dawn from the village, 
and a small flock of hawklike 
birds with oversized wings 
sprang up into flight from among 
the huts. The birds were green 
and vivid orange against the 
misty sky and flew circling over 
the village. 

“Let’s go,” said Gates. 



They began down the sloping 
road toward the huts, trying to 
look confident but not frighten- 
ing. 

At an open gateway in the wall 
of the fortified structure a figure 
appeared, a red-haired man 
dressed in dark jerkin and leg- 
gings and boots, with breastplate 
of silvery metal that matched the 
round helmet he carried in one 
hand. In the other was a spear. 
He stretched himself and yawn- 
ed, and appeared to be trying to 
scratch his ribs with the helmet. 
He was still a good distance away 
and gave no sign that he had 
spotted two aliens in strange suits 
walking into his town. 

The birds were more alert. The 
cries of the circling flock changed 
suddenly in tone, and in a mo- 
ment it had become a living 
arrow launched at Gates and 
Brazil. 

The two Earthmen stopped, 
each considering the possibility 
of mowing down the birds with 
stun pistols — which should have 
a disorganizing but not fatal effect 
on any complex nervous system 
— before the flock could strike 
them as it seemed it must, and 
both rejecting the idea, like twin 
channels of a single computer. 
The armored suits were tougher 
than any bird was likely to be; 
leave defense to the suits and 
don’t hurt the native pets. 

The flock broke off before con- 



20 



GALAXY 



tact, to circle the intruders in a 
blurred uproar of wings and 
claws, but several birds scraped 
the helmets, which were almost 
invisible in mild light, and one 
tore head-on at Brazil’s apparent- 
ly unprotected face, possibly 
meaning to veer away an inch 
from his eyes. 

The thud of impact was im- 
pressive; when Brazil’s eyes 
opened from the reflex blink, the 
bird was flopping on the ground 
with something badly broken. He 
picked it up, intending to im- 
press the natives with his friend- 
liness by treating kindly their pet 
that had attacked him, and also 
to suggest to them that it was 
futile to attack; but it struggled 
and fought his armored hands so 
he could do nothing else if he 
tried to hold it. 

TTE SET it gently down again 
as the first natives came 
blinking and shivering out of 
their huts to see what all the 
noise was about, some of them 
still pulling on scanty rags of 
clothing. They were all of a type 
with the body on the rock, blond, 
tall humanoids with deep chests 
and slender limbs; in the living 
people were visible a dozen small 
distinctions of facial and bodily 
proportion that added up to an 
obvious but not at first definable 
difference from any Earthman. 

The red-haired man of the 



fortress had ducked inside the 
gateway, which was still open. A 
domestic-looking animal with 
plumes on its head looked out 
at the strangers with interest. 

The blond natives stood to- 
gether in front of their huts, as if 
waiting for a group picture to be 
taken, gaping at their visitors in 
silence. The watchbird flock still 
screamed and flew, now in widen- 
ing circles, having given up 
assault at least temporarily. 

Gates kept moving forward 
until he stood near the center of 
the cleared space between beach 
and huts. Brazil stopped beside 
him there and they stood almost 
motionless, smiling, arms spread 
with hands open, in the approved 
position for approaching Appar- 
ent Primitives who seem timid. 
The sun stood over the horizon 
now, dissipating the morning fog. 

Brazil became aware that the 
whole crowd was watching him. 
Only now and then did one shoot 
a quick glance at Gates, as if 
puzzled about something. 

Gates spoke via throat mike and 
radio, without moving his smil- 
ing lips. “You look like ’em, boy. 
I think you better play leader. 
They may have never seen any- 
one dark as me before.” 

Brazil made the practiced 
throat-muscle movement that 
switched on his speaker and 
opened his mouth to begin the 
greeting of his public with sooth- 



PLANETEER 



21 



ing sounds. He was interrupted 
by Sam’s voice in his ear again. 
“Coming from the fort.” 

Six Apparent Primitives who 
looked anything but timid were 
marching in sloppy formation 
down the slope from the walled 
structure, straight toward the 
Earthmen, bearing spears and 
facial expressions that Brazil 
could not interpret as meaning 
anything good. They were all red- 
haired and armored, muscular, 
well fed, and bulbous-nosed, 
evidently of a different tribe or 
race than the blond hut dwellers. 

Brazil’s barefoot audience 
watched the warriors’ approach 
nervously and began to fade back 
into their huts. But one of the 
older men who had been staring 
Brazil in the eye with an expres- 
sion of mounting and intense 
emotion — the planeteer grew 
edgy at not being able to decide 
what emotion — now sprang 
forward in serious excitement, to 
grab Brazil, by the arm and 
harangue him with the first na- 
tive speech he had heard, look- 
ing at him with the gaze of a 
pleading worshiper. 

The six red warriors were very 
near and didn’t look happy at all. 
They also seemed to be concen- 
trating on Brazil. 

W ITH a cry of seeming de- 
spair, the old man tore him- 
self away from Brazil and fled 



toward a hut as if in mortal 
terror. 

One of the approaching war- 
riors threw his spear with a whip- 
ping expert motion; it caught the 
old man in the back and sent 
him dying on his face in the 
sand. 

“Well, I’ll be—” Boris Brazil 
roared out the first Earth words 
into the air of Aqua. 

The red-haired warriors stood 
before him, eying him with what 
he interpreted as incredulous con- 
tempt. One of them barked some- 
thing that he thought he could 
almost translate: “What are you 
doing, you blond peasant clod, 
dressed up in that outlandish 
armor?” He probably looked 
more like a blond native in the 
suit, with his physical proportions 
somewhat concealed, than he 
would without it. 

The one who had speared the 
old man started walking toward 
his victim, maybe to retrieve his 
weapon. Brazil started that way 
too, with no clear idea of what 
he was going to do, but with 
the feeling that the old man had 
appealed to him in vain for help. 

As Brazil started to move, the 
five other spears were suddenly 
leveled at him. A hysterical blond 
boy ran out of a hut to kneel be- 
side the old man and scream 
something that sounded nasty at 
the approaching warrior. Gates 
was standing motionless a few 



22 



GALAXY 



yards away. A spear thrust fast 
and hard against Brazil’s chest 
with plain intent to kill, setting 
him back on his heels; a lordly 
voice from the Yuan Chwang said 
in his ear, “This is not our affair.” 
Brazil grabbed the thrusting spear 
in his left hand, jerked its owner 
forward off balance, and delivered 
with his armored right fist what 
seemed an appropriate greeting to 
an Apparent Primitive Attempt- 
ing Murder of Earthman. 

The blow knocked the man out 
from under his helmet and 
dropped him to the sand. Spears 
rocked Boris from all sides, 
clashed and slid around his hel- 
met. He caught a glimpse of the 
sixth warrior kicking the boy, 
knocking him over, and pulling a 
short axe from his belt for a 
finishing blow. 

The arm swinging back the 
axe suddenly released it; the 
weapon spun through the air to 
land yards away and the warrior 
sat down suddenly and nerve- 
lessly. Sam Gates had decided it 
was time for stun pistols. 

Before Brazil had reached the 
same conclusion, the four re- 
maining spearmen had given up 
trying to stick him through his 
suit and were grabbing at his 
arms to hold him. Gates potted 
two more of them, in the legs, 
with silent and invisible force. 
The remaining two abandoned 
the fight and backed away to- 



ward their stronghold with spears 
leveled, shouting what was no 
doubt a call for reinforcements. 
The red that Brazil had felled 
got up and tottered dazedly after 
them. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said 
Gates. 

Brazil’s eye swept around. The 
old man was dead, the spear still 
in him. The young boy who had 
been kicked was lying uncon- 
scious right in front of a warrior 
who was going to be considerably 
annoyed as soon as he felt a little 
better. Brazil scooped the child up 
and got him over his shoulders 
in a fireman’s carry and looked 
at Gates, who gave a sort of 
facial shrug, as if to say: If we 
can save a life, there’s no need 
to ponder possible bad conse- 
quences, since this whole opera- 
tion looks like a fizzle now 
anyway. 

f I ^HEY strode at a good pace 
out of the village as the watch- 
birds screamed a cheerful fare- 
well. A few reds were milling 
around the gateway of the fort 
as the Earthmen went over the 
rise and out of sight, but no 
organized pursuit was yet visible. 
Once out of sight of the village 
they began a steady loping run, 
the small body bouncing on 
Brazil’s shoulders. Gates called 
for the robot to bring the scout 
up to the surface at the shoreline. 



PLANETEER

“This is the Tribune,” said a 
voice. “What do you intend doing 
with that child?” 

“Saving his neck,” said Gates. 
“Maybe we can learn something 
from him too.” 

They ran with stun pistols 
drawn, spinning around fre- 
quently to see if anyone followed 
them. No one pursued. 

Brazil was gasping when he 
finished the climb down the rocks 
to the shoreline and set his un- 
conscious burden — no, half 
conscious now, with a swelling 
lump on the forehead — down 
inside the airlock. The outer door 
shut behind Gates and the robot 
had the scout underwater and 
moving out to sea in a moment. 

Entertaining an alien aboard a 
scoutship was something the 
Space Force had learned to plan 
for ahead of time. A door in the 
back of a suit locker led from the 
airlock into the tiny Alien Room, 
into which Gates was now feed- 
ing atmosphere from outside, via 
snorkel and remote control. When 
the room was ready, Brazil 
carried the boy into it, sealing 
the door behind him. Gates could 
now decontaminate in the airlock, 
and go to the control room. Brazil 
would have to wear suit and 
helmet for a while yet. 

Medical was already on the 
communicator in the Alien Room 
when Brazil turned to look at 
the screen, after putting the kid 




^ Kiwi

down on the bed-acceleration 
couch that took up most of the 
room, checking the air pressure 
and setting the temperature up 
a few degrees. 

“Kid doesn’t look too bad off,” 
Brazil told the doctor. He smiled 
reassuringly at the boy, who was 
now fully conscious and lay 
watching with wide eyes and a 
growing yellowish Ipmp on his 
forehead. He might be ten or 
eleven years old, judged by Earth 
standards. 

“Keep him quiet. And get us a 
blood sample as soon as possible. 
Do you think we’ll have to feed 
him?” 

“Yes. If we can keep him for a 
week or two we should get the 
language and a good line on the 
local culture. We’ve got synthetic 
proteins and simple sugars on the 
scout, of course, so I guess he 
won’t starve — but I’ll try for 
your blood sample first. And 
listen, this may be important — 
I’m turning off the video screen 
for now, so it won’t alarm him. 
But when it’s on again, keep any- 
one with red hair off it. Use 
blond, noble, handsome people 
like me if possible.” 

Brazil started to call Sam on 
the intercom, but through a valve 
into the Alien Room came sterile 
blankets and a painless blood 
sample syringe, before he could 
ask for them. 

Chandragupta’s voice came 



into his helmet: “This is the Tri- 
bune. I have little complaint 
of your actions so far, except 
that your striking that man with 
your fist served no good purpose. 
But I must forbid you to keep 
that child any longer than is 
necessary for his own welfare.” 

“How long will that be, Chan?” 
asked Captain Dietrich’s voice, 
getting no immediate answer. 
“Would the boy be welcomed 
home, or speared like that old 
man, or what? I think we’d better 
learn the language and ctistoms 
before trying to decide. And as 
for Brazil’s hitting that man — ” 

A debate went on. Brazil 
listened with half an ear while 
he covered his guest with blankets 
and sat beside him, trying to 
inspire confidence. 

“It’s all right, sonny, it’s all 
right.” I hope, he thought. He 
patted the boy gently with his 
armored hand. That was the only 
treatment he dared attempt imtil 
he knew considerably more about 
the biology of his guest. 

And the guest could be very 
valuable. Children made good 
subjects for First Contact as a 
rule, if they were not too young. 
Their minds adapted quickly to 
the alien. They caught on quickly 
to the game of language teach- 
ing. And they were likely to 
give an honest and direct view of 
their own culture. 

Brazil handed the blood-sample 



26 



GALAXY 



syringe to the boy after locking 
the plunger. The kid took it after 
a brief hesitation, looked it over 
cautiously, then gave a sudden 
shy smile and said something that 
might have been a question. If 
his head was bothering him he 
gave no sign of it. 

Brazil answered with some 
kindly nonsense and took the 
ss^ringe back. He made a show of 
rubbing it on his own suited arm, 
turning his head to the other 
side as he did so. Then he turned 
the boy’s head gently away and 
got his blood sample without fuss, 
on the first try. He valved the 
loaded syringe out into the air- 
lock, where the robot came to 
load it into a courier tube that 
would carry it up to the Yuan 
Chwang. 

l^ARTH and Aqua life turned 
out to be too alien to one 
another for infectious disease to 
pose a problem either way. Brazil 
shed his suit with relief. 

The courier tube returned be- 
fore sunset with containers of 
vile looking gunk that Supply 
swore would feed the boy, whose 
name was approximately Tim. 
Tim tasted the stuff but looked 
unhappy, so Gates went out 
spearfishing. Tim was pleased 
with some of the assortment and 
ate it raw, while turning down 
the rest in disgust. He seemed 
to be suffering no after effects 



from the kick in the head, 
but Brazil did his best to keep 
him quiet anyway. 

For the next few days the 
scout stayed well out at sea, 
mostly submerged. 

Brazil spent most of his time 
in the Alien Room, pretending to 
learn Tim’s language almost as 
fast as he could hear the words, 
while the linguistically expert 
brains, human and mechanical, 
aboard the Yuan Chwang, looked 
and listened over his shoulder. 
They forgot nothing, and spoke 
into his ear, prompting him on 
what to say next. 

Tim became restlessly active 
after getting over his first awed 
fascination with video screen, 
doors, acceleration couch and 
plumbing. When told he was 
aboard a ship, he wanted to see 
it all. Brazil kept the robot, at 
least, out of Tim’s sight, and had 
to struggle to learn more than he 
taught. He played games with 
Tim to give him exercise, and to 
gather data on his physical 
strength and dexterity. 

The hungry brains aboard the 
Yuan Chwang devoured Tim’s 
language. Within two weeks they 
had fed it by memory tape to 
every planeteer. A few days of 
practice would give them com- 
mand of it. 

It was time for a major con- 
ference. The two planeteers on 
surface sat in with Captain 



PLANETEER

Dietrich and the department 
heads above, via communicator, 
while Tim was confined discon- 
tentedly to the Alien Room. 

“Gentlemen, we have a choice 
between two main courses of ac- 
tion,” the Captain began. “We can 
try again to establish relations 
with the natives of this island, 
on some friendly basis, or we 
can pull out and start over some- 
where else, and hope we don’t get 
into a brawl with the local author- 
ities at the start.” The Captain 
was not chewing out his planet- 
eers for the fight; when he 
chewed, there was never anything 
equivocal about his words. 

“Those authorities I didn’t 
mind brawling with,” said Gates. 

The Captain went on. “I think 
we can agree that our only major 
problem on this island is likely to 
be intercultural?” 

1^0 ONE disputed him. There 
■*- ’ were no horrendous non-in- 
telligent life forms, volcanos or 
other insuperable acts of nature 
in evidence on the target island. 

“I’d like to say that I hope we 
can find a way to set up a base 
on this island,” said Biology. 
“That luminous water-ring was 
fascinating, even though I’m not 
sure it’s in my field. And that 
groundvine ...” 

“We can’t complete our gravitic 
tables for this system without 
seismic measurements of the 



planet,” put in Geology. “That 
island still looks like a good place 
to me.” 

“Well, then — does everyone 
think we should try the island 
again?” The Captain looked 
around as if a bit surprised. 

“We’ve got the language here 
now,” said Brazil. “Our tapes 
show the red tribe’s speech is 
nearly the same as Tim’s. And 
they’re already trying to kill us 
on sight, so what can we lose by 
another try?” 

“We can cause considerable 
damage to the people of this 
island if we are not careful, 
Mr. Brazil,” said Chandragupta 
sharply. “Indeed, we may have 
caused damage already, by in- 
serting ourselves into a situation 
of considerable tension between 
two tribes — though any harm we 
may have done was accidental 
and I do not blame you for it. 
Yet we are not on this world by 
invitation, and so we must assume 
a certain responsibility for such 
accidents.” 

“You mean that sociological 
damage has been caused by our 
visit?” asked the Captain. He had 
already heard all about it, but he 
wanted the subject talked over 
now. 

“I think I can explain that,” 
said Sociology, clearing his 
throat. “The data we have from 
Tim fit in with what we saw on 
First Contact. Everything indi- 



28 



GALAXY 



cates that conditions on the is- 
land may be ripe for civil war. 

“The picture is this: a local 
settled tribe, fishermen and part- 
time farmers — the Blonds, as we 
have come to call them — invaded 
and conquered by a warrior tribe 
of the Viking type, probably fewer 
in numbers. The invaders seem to 
have come from the smaller is- 
lands farther north. Perhaps they 
were driven out themselves by 
someone else. Now they have 
settled down here as a ruling 
class. Tim says this invasion was 
a very long time ago, before he 
was born, but that his grand- 
father — the old man who un- 
fortunately was killed during our 
First Contact — could remember 
a time when there were no Reds 
on the island, and his people were 
free. We make the invasion to 
have been about fifty years ago. 
We’ve seen no evidence of in- 
termarriage, although in fact 
we’ve seen none of the Red 
women or children yet.” 

“Tim talks of a day when his 
people will rise up and destroy 
the Reds,” said Brazil. “The 
dream of his young life seems to 
be to find a way to slaughter 
them wholesale. He wants me to 
lead the revolution. I have the 
feeling though that he doesn’t 
really hate them, or didn’t until 
grandpa bit the dust. It’s mainly 
just a sort of exciting game in 
his mind. But I don’t doubt he 



would wipe them out if given a 
chance. Someone has talked a 
lot of revolution to him, that’s for 
sure. 

“Tim’s grandfather thought I 
was a tribal folk-hero, come back 
from the great beyond or some- 
where, wearing strange armor, to 
lead them out of slavery. That’s 
what the old man was talking to 
me about. I suppose that’s why 
they speared him. It’s on the tape, 
of course, if any of you haven’t 
seen it. Now I can understand 
what he was saying.” Brazil fell 
moodily silent. 

“I suppose the First Contact in- 
cident might have touched off a 
Blond rebellion?” someone asked. 

“If conditions had been just 
right, yes,” said Sociology. “Ap- 
parently they were not.” 

^APTAIN Dietrich spoke up: 
“During the last five days 
we’ve made numerous high speed 
photo runs with recon robots from 
as low as five miles on clear days. 
If there were any riots or open 
warfare in progress, we’d be 
pretty sure to spot it.” 

“How about that body lashed 
to the rock?” someone asked after 
a brief pause. “Have we learned 
anything on that?” 

“Tim can’t read or write,” said 
Sociology. “So neither can we, 
yet. So we don’t know what the 
placard hung around the fellow’s 
neck says. Tim says the Reds 



PLANETEER 



29 



put him up there because they 
were angry at him. Seems reason- 
able, if not illuminating.” 

“Captain, I wish we had made 
such photo runs as you now men- 
tion before First Contact,” said 
the Tribune. 

“We weren’t sure of their tech- 
nological level then,” said the 
Captain, a little wearily. “We 
didn’t want them to spot us fly- 
ing over. It’s one of those choices 
you have to make. We didn’t 
want to shock them by appearing 
as gods, remember?” 

The discussion flowed on for 
a while. Finally Dietrich brought 
it back to his original question: 
“Shall we continue to try for a 
base on this island, or shall we 
move on?” 

“Let’s try again here, since 
we’ve got a start,” said Gates. “If 
we can’t make it, we can always 
move on to another island.” 
Chandragupta: “The question I 
must insist we try to answer, Mr. 
Gates, is this: How can we be 
helpful to the people of this 
island, where we have already 
interfered?” 

The Captain: “Chan, we didn’t 
come all this way to open a social 
service bureau.” 

“I realize that. Captain.” 
Grimly. “Nevertheless, I consider 
our effect upon the natives more 
important than seismic measure- 
ments. I would like to ask if you 
plan to conclude an agreement 



f 



with the authorities controlling j 
those Red soldiers, for a scientific 
base on the island?” 

“I’m considering it.” 

“I believe our doing so would ' 
in effect recognize their authority 
to live as they do, holding another 
tribe in slavery.” ! 

Sociology raised his eyebrows. i 
“What do you mean by slavery? j 
It would be unusual if it could I 
not be found in some form at 
this level.” 

“Perhaps I should have been 
more precise. I consider it evil 
that a member of the ruling class 
should have it in his power to 
take at any time the life of one i 
of the lower class, as we have 
seen here. I think we are now 
bound to try to correct such a , 
condition. Of course I do not 
expect that we shall be able, or 
should attempt, to establish our 
idea of a perfect society here. 
But I think we must try to set 
these people on the road to great- 
er freedom and justice.” Chandra- 
gupta raised his voice above sev- 
eral protesting ones. “We are 
already committed to interfer- 
ence here, in my view. We must 
now see that the changes we | 
produce are for the better.” 

The Captain smiled faintly. 
“Are you arguing for the revolu- 
tion now, Chan?” 

“I think you know better.” The 
Tribune was somewhat irritated. 
‘We could hardly expect the total 

GALAXY 

i 



effect of a general armed uprising 
to be beneficial.” 

“Just what do you think we 
should do, then, to start these 
people on the road to greater 
freedom and justice, as you put 
it?” 

Chandragupta sighed. “I think 
we must first investigate them 
further, to learn how best to 
help.” 

There was a little silence. 
“Anyone got further comment 
he thinks important?” asked the 
Captain. “All right, this is it. We 
continue work on this island. 
We try to stabilize native affairs 
on as just a basis as possible, 
and then deal for our base. Boris, 
you say Tim has relatives in an 
inland village who can hide him 
out from the Reds if need be?” 
“So he tells me.” 

“All right. Take him to this 
inland village, tonight or tomor- 
row night. Talk with some of the 
adults there. Especially try to 
find out more about the political 
situation. Is there a Blond resist- 
ance group, how strong, and so 
on. Since we seem to be com- 
mitted to some sort of interfer- 
ence here, we’d better get all 
the data we can, and quickly. Any 
questions?” 

^T^HE following night was dark 
■*- and foggy. Gates drove the 
scoutship silently and he hoped 
invisibly over the island’s hills 



toward the village of Tim’s rela- 
tives. They boy acted as pilot, 
guiding an electronically pre- 
sented green spot over a contour 
map of the island, with an air of 
sophistication. He had, he said, 
seen maps before, if not flying 
machines. But he was excited at 
the prospect of showing off Brazil 
in armor to people he knew, and 
telling them of the wonders he 
had seen. Brazil had given him 
orders to keep the scoutship’s 
flying powers secret if possible. 

Brazil changed the scale of the 
map to show only the area within 
a mile of the village. Tim guided 
Gates to a clear landing spot, 
out of sight of the village but 
within easy walking distance. 

Gates brought the scout down 
quickly, probing below with radar 
and infrared, until the little ship 
settled with a crackle of crushed 
vines into a tiny hollow between 
hills. Gates left the autopilot on 
to keep the scout balanced on 
its tail at ground level, and 
joined Brazil in observing the out- 
side world with instruments. 

The chittering and movement 
of small life alarmed by their 
landing gradually quieted. There 
were no signs of human alarm. 

Brazil suited up, for protection 
against other dangers than in- 
fection. He led Tim into the air- 
lock, and paused for a final brief- 
ing. 

“Now, who did we agree you 



30 



PL AN ET EER 



31 



should look for in the village?” 

“First of all I will look for 
Sunto. He is one of my cousins. 
He hates the Reds and is not 
afraid of them. If he is not home 
I will seek Lorto or Tammamo, 
who are the junior headmen of 
the village. Only if I can find 
none of those will I talk to my 
female cousins, who do not un- 
derstand these things. I will try 
to avoid Tamotim, who I think is 
still the boss headman here. He 
likes the Reds and tells them 
things. If I see no one who is 
safe to talk to I will come back 
here and we will talk over what 
to do next.” 

“And if someone stops you and 
asks you questions?” 

“I will not hide anything. I 
will just say there is a strange 
man out here who wants to speak 
with someone from the village. 
I know what to do, you don’t 
have to worry. I won’t say you 
are our Warrior Spirit, or any- 
thing like that. Unless there are 
Reds in the village, who capture 
me; then I will cry out for 
Warrior Spirit and you will come 
and kill them, eh?” 

“My name’s not Warrior Spirit. 
And if you see any Reds, just 
come back.” Brazil opened the 
lock’s outer door and they stepped 
out and down into matted vines. 
“Remember, just say I brought 
you over the hills if anyone asks 
how you come to be here. No 



one else need know yet that my 
ship can fly.” 

“All right. Over that way is a 
path,” said Tim, becoming 
oriented. “And that way is the 
village.” 

“Get going, then.” Brazil sent 
him off with a gentle shove, and 
stood quietly, testing the alien 
night with artificially aided 
senses. 

The sound of Tim’s bare feet 
faded quickly on the path. 

“I’ll take her up a ways,” said 
Gates on radio. 

“Roger. I’ll move over.” 

13RAZIL saw the dark bulk of 
■*^the scoutship lift in silence 
that was almost eerie even to 
him, and drift up out of sight 
into fog and darkness. No stars 
to see tonight, he thought. Well, 
I’ve seen enough of them. For a 
while. 

He found the path with his in- 
frared lamp and waited just at 
one side of it. He hoped the kid 
wouldn’t run into any trouble. 
About five minutes passed before 
the glass of his helmet, set for 
infrared translation, showed him 
some large life moving toward 
him along the trail from the 
village. “One — two of them, 
Sam, coming this way.” 

“Roger, I have them now.” 

“Boro?” His native name, 
called in a soft voice from the 
darkness. 



32 



GALAXY 



Brazil switched his air mike on 
again. “Right here.” 

Tim approached him. “This is 
Tammamo with me. Boro. He is 
a junior headman.” 

Brazil gave the second vague 
shape a slight bow, which Tim 
had told him was the ordinary 
greeting between equals. 

“Sam, keep a sharp eye out. 
We need to use a little light 
down here.” Planeteers worked 
their air-mike switches for such 
asides as quickly and naturally 
as they used their tongues. 

“Rog.” Sam outdid himself in 
brevity. 

Brazil turned on what he 
hoped was a dim and non-start- 
ling electric glow from a detach- 
able suit lamp, revealing a Tam- 
mamo bug-eyed at being called 
out of his hut at night to meet 
what he might think was the 
Warrior Spirit. 

Boris greeted him in a matter- 
of-fact, business-like way. Maybe 
the fact that he spoke the com- 
mon language of the peasants put 
the junior headman more at 
ease. 

Tammamo had heard a ver- 
sion of the First Contact inci- 
dent which began with the Red 
garrison of the coastal village 
executing an old man for daring 
to worship the Sea God in a way 
reserved for rulers. Dying, the 
elder had called down a curse 
upon their heads, whereupon the 



Warrior Spirit of the Blonds ap- 
peared, and slew sixty Reds with 
a sweep of his arm — or per- 
haps it had taken several arm- 
sweeps, the point was uncertain. 
A Red magician had been called 
upon by the enemy. He had 
evoked from somewhere a dark 
and evil spirit, also clad in armor. 
The Blond Warrior had departed 
to do battle with this other else- 
where, not wishing to devastate 
the entire island in the struggle, 
but it was expected he would 
win and return shortly to — and 
this point was whispered very 
cautiously — slay all the Red 
warriors and turn over their 
women and children to the Blonds 
as slaves. 

Tammamo almost managed to 
look Brazil hopefully in the eye 
as he finished the tale. 

^1 ■'IM started to speak with the 
exasperated eagerness of a 
youngster to point out errors — 
or maybe in disappointment at 
being left out of the story alto- 
gether. But Brazil shushed him 
by putting a hand in front of his 
face. He spoke carefully to Tam- 
mamo. 

“Junior headman — look at me 
carefully. I am only a man, noth- 
ing more. I am not a Warrior 
Spirit, or any kind of god. I am 
only a man from a far land, who 
looks like one of your people and 
wears armor that is strange to

you. Now I wish to speak in pri- 
vate with the leaders of your 
people — not with the headman 
who tells everything to the Reds, 
but to the leaders of your own 
people, who may not be known to 
everyone. Do you understand 
me?” 

“If you say you are a man, so 
be it.” Tammamo seemed to be 
shivering with more than the 
night chill. “The leaders you 
speak of — I do not know any- 
thing about such matters, except 
for stories heard by all. I am a 
junior headman, wishing no one 
to hate me. There is a man in the 
village who might know. His 
name is Sunto. I can tell him 
what you want when I meet him. 
Will that please you?” 

“It will. And I think there is no 
need for you to speak of me to 
anyone else.” 

“I will not! I will not!” 

“Then send Sunto here to meet 
me at this time tomorrow night. 
One thing more, junior headman 
— this boy goes to live now with 
his relatives in your village. I 
want you, Tammamo, to see to it 
that no harm comes to him from 
the Reds. As I said, I am only a 
man, yet I can do many things. 
I would be quite angry if the 
Reds were to harm this boy. Do 
you understand?” 

Tammamo indicated vehe- 
mently that he understood. Obvi- 
ously he wished himself a hun- 



dred miles at sea, or an5rwhere 
out of this situation. 

“Tim, keep out of trouble. Go, 
both of you, and send me Sunto 
here tomorrow night.” 

Evidently it was not a Blond 
habit to waste any time in fare- 
wells. 

Brazil watched them out of 
sight, realizing suddenly he was 
going to miss having the kid 
around. “Okay, Sam, you can 
bring her down.” 

Trudging to where the scout 
was crackling down into vines, 
Brazil paused and looked up to- 
ward the invisible nose with a 
sudden grin. 

“Hey, dark and evil spirit,” he 
called via radio. “How come you 
let that Red magician evoke you 
to fight me?” 

“Shut up and get in.” 

CUNTO appeared at the ap- 
pointed place on the follow- 
ing night, escorted by Tim. This 
time the scout had not landed; 
Brazil was lowered the last few 
hundred feet by cable. 

Sunto seemed less timid than 
Tammamo. He too had heard of 
the First Contact fight, but was 
shrewd enough to realize how 
events could change in the seeing 
and retelling of them. He pro- 
fessed no doubt that Brazil was 
only a man, and a friend of the 
Blonds. Would he arrange a 
meeting with the Blond leaders? 



34 



GALAXY 



Certainly. There was going to be 
a meeting of those leaders in the 
remote hills, three nights from 
now. Boro could come to it if 
he wished, there would be many 
large fires at the meeting place 
90 it would be easy to find. Was 
Boro living in the hills now? 

Did everyone know about this 
meeting, Brazil asked him. What 
if the Reds saw this large fire? 
Why had Tammamo been so 
timid about discussing Blond 
leaders? 

Sunto did not quite under- 
stand; he used several new words 
in trying to answer the ques- 
tions. Eventually the idea came 
across that this was going to be 
a religious meeting, and not poli- 
tical at all. He, Sunto, knew no 
more than that timid Tammamo 
about political matters. Of course 
the Reds would not interfere with 
this religious meeting; the Sea 
God might become angry with 
them if they did. True, the Reds 
controlled the Tower, but that 
didn’t mean others couldn’t hold 
meetings of this type, did it? 

“Of course not,” agreed Brazil 
soberly. He got a repeat on the 
time and place of the meeting, 
and went home to the scout. 

They located the meeting with- 
out trouble, as Sunto had pre- 
dicted. Brazil was lowered by 
cable again, a quarter mile from 
the circle of fires in the hills 
near the center of the island. 



Gates held the scout overhead, 
ready for anything, while Brazil 
walked to the lighted area. 

About fifty Blonds of both 
sexes were quietly busy with 
varied rituals within the illumi- 
nated circle. There were no detec- 
table lookouts posted around the 
place, or any attempt at conceal- 
ment. 

Brazil watched for a little 
while, far enough away to be in- 
visible to those near the fires. 
Then he walked slowly in on 
them, arms spread out in a ges- 
ture of peace. There seemed to 
be nothing frantic or very rigid 
about the ceremonies, so he had 
no great worry about interrupt- 
ing. 

Gradually they became aware 
of him, the nearer ones first. They 
stopped what they were at and 
turned to watch him with grave 
eyes. Within a few seconds all of 
them were standing still, calmly 
and silently watching him. Then 
a few of them moved slightly, 
opening a lane from where Brazil 
stood to a place near the center 
of the circle. He could see now 
a low structure of stone that stood 
there, a few feet square. It might 
be an altar. 

“Any advice?” he subvocalized 
to the watchers above. 

“Best thing I can think of is 
to bow in greeting and tell them 
to proceed with what they’re 
doing,” said some anonymous ex- 



PL AN ET EER

pert. No one argued with him. 
The final decision on what to do 
rested with Brazil, as it usually 
did with the planeteer — the 
man on the spot, with the re- 
sponsibility. He was rarely given 
orders in any detail. 

T his time he accepted the ad- 
vice offered from above. It 
seemed to go over all right. The 
attention of the Blond group 
turned from him to the central 
altar, where a few men and 
women began to perform some 
simple rites. The others stood 
watching with folded arms. 
Brazil folded his. No one was 
sitting down, and he resigned 
himself to what might be a long 
stand. An hour went by. He 
wished himself wearing armor, 
ground, heavy, with powered legs 
that would let you nap standing 
if you wished. 

Not that he wanted to nap 
now. There was the ceremony 
to watch, although it had so far 
shown him little that was new 
or especially interesting. It had 
elements that Brazil had seen in 
life or on training tapes of a 
hundred primitive religions on a 
dozen planets. 

But the climax of the cere- 
mony was unique. A pair of mus- 
cular — deacons? Brazil could 
distinguish no one set apart as 
clergy — came from the dark- 
ness outside the waning fire- 



light. They bore a large and 
heavy pottery vessel that wobbled 
in their grip as they carried it, 
as if it held a quantity of liquid. 

Someone held a torch to illumi- 
nate the altar top. A slender 
tower about two feet high had 
been built of small flat pebbles, 
surrounded by a low wall of 
similar construction. 

The men with the jar ap- 
proached the rear of the altar 
and raised the vessel toward it, 
as a woman thrust a trough into 
position. They tipped the big 
jar evenly. What looked like clear 
water sluiced out of it, guided by 
the trough toward the pebble- 
tower. For a moment it looked to 
Brazil as if the little structure 
might withstand the flood, but 
some vital part of the base gave 
way suddenly. The men continued 
to tilt the vessel smoothly till it 
was empty. The tower toppled, 
taking with it part of the sur- 
rounding wall. It was washed 
piecemeal from the sloping altar 
by the last of the flood. 

It hit them hard, Brazil could 
see, looking from one Blond face 
to another in the firelight. None 
of them stirred for a long minute. 
It was plain that the collapse of 
the tower had had some evil 
significance. 

Tower? Simto had mentioned a 
tower connected with the Sea 
God, and controlled by the Reds. 

The Blonds seemed to shake 



36 



GALAXY 



off some of their gloom. Again 
they were turning toward Brazil. 

“Ceremony didn’t turn out too 
well, I think,” said the voice from 
the Yuan Chwang. “Just hope 
they don’t blame it on you.” 
Once more everyone was 
watching Brazil, except for a 
couple of men who had begun to 
dismantle the altar. 

Might as well get started, he 
thought. He switched on his air 
mike. He could not see most of 
his audience well in this light, 
and could not pick out anyone 
as leader. 

■fXE spoke out loudly: “I am a 
man who has come from a 
far land, and I would learn what 
I can about the people here.” 
The faint stir and whispering 
among them ceased. All watched 
him with guarded faces. There 
was only the fire glow and 
crackle, and the twittering back- 
ground of animals or insects. 

“This — ” Brazil realised he had 
no certain word for ritual or cere- 
mony. “What you have done at 
this meeting is strange to me. If 
I can do so without giving offense, 
I would learn about it. Will some- 
one here tell me?” 

A light clear voice came from 
somewhere in the background: 
“Are you he of whom it is said, 
that he slew sixty Reds with a 
sweep of his arm?” 

“It is said, but it is not true. 



I fought with six of them, but I 
slew none.” 

“You fought with six of them, 
yet none of them slew you.” The 
still anonymous voice used a more 
subtle grammar than Tim had 
taught, and had a slightly differ- 
ent accent. With his limited ex- 
perience in listening to the 
natives, Brazil could not identify 
it as male or female. But it 
smelled of authority to him. He 
answered the implied question. 
“My armor is strong. And I had 
help from one who is wrongly 
called a dark demon, who is 
only a man like me, my country- 
man and friend.” 

“So have I heard it.” 

The speaker moved forward 
slowly into brighter firelight — a 
woman. Not a girl, and not an 
old woman, or middle-aged. Not 
the kind that a man will follow 
with his eyes from the first glance, 
but the kind he will turn to see 
again a quarter-minute later, and 
remember. So Brazil thought of 
her at first sight, and only re- 
membered with a start the subtle 
unearthliness of her face and 
body. 

“So have I heard it, from those 
who were there and saw with 
open eyes.” She came close to 
Brazil, dressed as simply as the 
others. She studied him for a 
moment. “You speak with the 
tongue of a simple Blond peas- 
ant.” 



PLANETEER

“It was one such who taught 
me. 

“You learned well." What is 
your name?” 

“In your tongue it is best said 
as Boro. And what is yours, if 
I may ask without giving of- 
fense?” 

She smiled. “Certainly, there 
has never been a god so fearful 
of giving offense. My name is 
Ariton. Tell these people whether 
you are god or man. I fear some 
of them will still not believe what 
you told Sunto.” 

Brazil loudly pledged again 
his membership in humanity. 

Ariton waved her hand, and 
her people turned away. Most of 
them went to sit in a circle 
around where the altar had been. 
They began a low-voiced chant. 

S HE walked with Brazil a little 
away from the group, and 
tried to answer his questions 
about the ceremony he had wit- 
nessed. Her explanation was un- 
intelligible with new words at 
first; finally he got her to simplify 
it enough for him to understand 
that the tiny tower on the altar 
had been an analog of a full sized 
structure in the island’s chief 
city. The big Tower was sacred 
to the Sea God. Now it was 
monopolized by the Red priests, 
and beside it the king of the 
Reds, Galamand, had built a 
castle. At mentioning the king’s 



name, Ariton moved her foot as 
if grinding something into the 
dirt beneath her heel. Tim had 
sometimes done that when speak- 
ing of the Reds. 

“And what did the water-pour- 
ing mean?” 

“Maybe something bad.” She 
looked at Brazil thoughtfully and 
raised a hand to touch his trans- 
parent helmet. “I have seen — 
before,” she said, using a new 
word that he thought meant glass, 
from the context. “Now I will ask 
a question. Why could not the 
Reds slay you, when they at- 
tacked you with spears?” 

“My armor is stronger than it 
looks.” 

“And why did you slay none 
of them?” 

“There was no need.” 

“Those of my people who 
watched with open eyes say that 
you were angry at the slaying of 
an old man you did not know. 
Why?” 

Brazil pondered. “There was 
no need for his slaying, either, 
that I could see.” 

“You carry no spear or sword 
or bow, nor did your dark com- 
panion. How could you fight six 
spearmen?” 

After a moment Brazil raised 
a hand to touch his helmet. “My 
armor is not easily seen, yet it is 
very strong. So is it with my 
weapons.” 

“Strong Red warriors could not 



38 



GALAXY 



hurt you with their spears,” Ari- 
ton said thoughtfully. “And when 
they tried to seize you they were 
struck down by cramps and sick- 
ness, like swimmers who have en- 
tered cold water with full bellies. 
So the Sea God might . .” 

“But it was not the Sea God. 
Shall we sit down here?” 

He gallantly let her have the 
low boulder that presented itself, 
and crunched his armored seat 
down into groundvine. The suit 
was a load to stand around in, 
even at .95 gravity. 

“Where is your dark companion 
now? And your ship?” 

“He is not far. And our ship 
is near the island.” 

Ariton apparently thought it 
natural that a man alone among 
strangers should be a bit secre- 
tive about the location of his 
friends. 

Some water from the altar 
flood had run into the nearest 
fire, and the light grew dimmer 
yet. There was no word in Bra- 
zil’s ear from above. 

“It might be thought that you 
and your friend are only casta- 
ways upon this island, as none 
have seen your ship.” 

TTE took the suggestion calmly. 

“It is not so. Our ship is 
near, with others of my people 
aboard.” 

“Why have you come to this 
island?” 



“My countrymen and I travel 
to learn things, about new lands 
none of us has seen before. Some 
of us would like to live on this 
island for a little while, perhaps 
a few years, on some land your 
people do not use. We do not 
want to boss your people, or to 
take anything we do not pay 
for.” 

“I have no land to give anyone, 
while there are Reds on the 
island.” Ariton’s voice was sharp. 

“Some of my people will talk 
to the Reds, too, about using land. 
But we will not trade with a 
tribe that holds another tribe in 
slavery.” 

She was puzzled. “But who 
does not own slaves, if he can? 
If we could enslave the Reds, 
we would. Do you own no slaves 
at home?” 

“It has been very many years 
since my tribe held slaves. A 
tribe becomes stronger when it 
does not depend on them. My 
people have traveled far and 
looked at many tribes, and it is 
always so.” 

“But if all were free to choose, 
who would da the mean and dirty 
work of slaves by choice?” Ariton 
looked at him searchingly. 

Brazil gave a faint sigh. “True, 
someone must do such work — 
sometimes someone must be 
forced to do it. But even such 
lowly persons should be treated 
as members of the tribe, and not 



PL AN ETEER 



39 



killed or beaten as animals would 
be.” 

“And if there are two tribes, 
as on this island?” 

“Two tribes can live as one, 
if their leaders are wise and 
strong.” 

“That is a strange thought to 
me. But then I have never trav- 
eled in the far parts of the 
world.” Ariton meditated for a 
few moments, before she spoke 
again. 

“Will you. Boro, go to speak 
with the Red king about this 
matter of land? You still look 
like a Blond, so maybe the Reds 
will try again to slay you or im- 
prison you.” 

Brazil thought it over. “I may 
go. It is only chance that I look 
like a Blond. My shipmates are 
of varied appearance; some of 
them resemble Reds.” He thought 
to himself: What planeteer looks 
most like a Red? Foley, but his 
hair isn’t nearly the right shade. 
A little dye will fix that, if need 
be. 

“I will go with you, when you 
go to speak to Galamand,” Ariton 
announced. 

Brazil was surprised. “Do you 
enter safely into the Red king’s 
castle at will?” 

“The Reds are not likely to do 
me harm, and I think Galamand 
will see me if I visit him.” Ariton 
smiled. “I am a high priestess of 
the Sea God.” 



A NOTHER conference began 
as soon as Brazil was hoisted 
home to his scoutship. 

“Religion may give us a way 
to promote unity here,” said Soci- 
ology. ‘We see that Reds and 
Blonds both worship the same 
powerful Sea God. However, his 
sacred Tower seems to be a point 
of contention between the tribes.” 

“We think we have that Tower 
located, by the way,” put in Cap- 
tain Dietrich. “And what’s prob- 
ably the Red king’s castle, or at 
least his summer home. It seems 
too far from fresh water to with- 
stand a siege. Where’s that chart? 
Here, on this peninsula that pro- 
tects the harbor at Capital City, 
a large stone structure. Right 
next to it, on the side toward the 
ocean, is the tallest building on 
the island, a tower about ninety 
feet high. Then there’s a sea wall 
running the length of the penin- 
sula, for protection against waves 
and maybe invaders. 

“Foley, you and Brazil will be 
visiting Galamand as soon as we 
can locate him. Get your hair 
dyed to match the Reds. Maybe 
we can at least impress the na- 
tives with the idea that it’s pos- 
sible for Red and Blond to 
co-operate.” 

“I trust everything possible 
will be done to avoid another 
fight.” Chandragupta wore a 
frown. 

‘We’ll have to talk to the Reds 



40 



GALAXY 



sooner or later, if we’re going to 
get anywhere,” the Captain said. 
“Though it’s possible we may 
have to fight our way out again. 
Is anyone against sending a dele- 
gation to Galamand as soon as 
possible?” 

“Should we take Ariton along, 
as she suggested?” Gates asked 
the conference. 

“It might make us seem to be 
committed as her allies against 
the Reds.” 

“No doubt that’s what she 
wants.” 

“But it would bring the two 
leaders face to face. If there’s any 
possibility of ending the conflict 
between them, such a meeting 
might give us a clue to it.” 

Planeteer Foley, hair red- 
dened, was flown down and trans- 
ferred to scoutship Alpha, which 
lay out at sea again. Gates in- 
tended to hold himself in reserve, 
in the scout, to rescue the delega- 
tion if necessary. 

First it was necessary to locate 
the king, and to arrange to take 
Ariton to the planned meeting 
with him. Hoping to do both, Bra- 
zil almost literally dropped in, 
shortly after sunset one evening, 
on the hill village where she had 
told him she could usually be 
found. 

No Reds were in evidence. 
Again a flock of watchbirds as- 
saulted Brazil with futile energy. 
The Blond natives stared at him 



with some awe, but little sur- 
prise. They directed him to a 
building set against a hill. 

TT WAS a low structure of 
-*■ groundvine mats and rare 
wooden poles. Carved or molded 
masks hung in profusion at the 
gateway, the first artwork of any 
kind Brazil had seen on the 
island, except for the decorated 
armor of the Reds. 

He stood at the gateway in the 
low fence and called a greeting 
to the dark and open doorway 
of the house. In a few moments 
a Blond man, unusually tall and 
carrying an oil lamp, emerged 
from the rambling building. He 
stood studying Brazil emotion- 
lessly. 

“I am looking for Ariton,” 
Brazil repeated. The towering 
Blond somehow made him feel 
for a ridiculous moment like an 
adolescent suitor come to call on 
his girl and greeted by her older 
brother. 

“Ariton has gone to Capital 
City,” the man said finally. “To 
meet you or your countrymen 
there when you go to visit the 
king of the Redmen.” Again the 
grinding foot-motion at mention 
of Galamand. This man conveyed 
a suggestion erf insolent freedom 
and power to Brazil. It was im- 
possible for him to think of this 
man or Ariton as slaves. 

“Is Galamand now in his 



PLANETEER 



41 



castle beside the Tower of the 
Sea God?” Brazil asked. 

“Yes.” The Blond man paused, 
then seemed to reach a sudden 
decision involving Brazil. “Come 
with me.” He beckoned with his 
lamp and led the way into the 
house. 

They followed a passage lead- 
ing back toward the hillside. The 
open rooms they passed con- 
tained things of shapes unknown 
to Brazil, things carven and fea- 
thered and stained. More temple 
than home, certainly. 

“Here.” The Blond turned aside 
suddenly, and stooped to roll up 
a floor mat. Buried among mats of 
groundvine that filled a hole evi- 
dently of considerable depth, 
were row upon row of spears, 
simply made but strong and 
sharp. 

“When your king comes to this 
island,” said the Blond, showing 
powerful white teeth above his 
beard, “he will find ready help 
to topple the Reds from power. 
Not all my people are willing to 
live the lives of animals. Long 
have we planned and waited. 
The Reds are fewer than we. 
Each year they stay more within 
their forts and in their walled 
city, and each year hurt us more, 
with killings and beatings. We 
will be willing to help you.” 

Brazil took a deep breath. “If 
you want to help me, you will 
not rise armed against the Reds. 



You will agree to live with them 
as one tribe, when they also 
agree.” 

The man stared at Brazil for 
a long moment, then gave a short 
and nasty laugh. “When they say 
that will be the day when they 
are helpless.” 

“But remember what I say, if 
you wish your own people well,” 
said Brazil, turning to leave. “Let 
there be no armed rising against 
the Reds.” 

“Not yet,” said the Blond in a 
cold voice. “Not yet for a little 
while.” 

13RAZIL and Foley stood 
among tall bushes and grass 
on a hillside with a fair view of 
the town whose name translated 
into Capital City, early after 
sunrise on the next morning. 
They wore heavy ground armor, 
in camouflage colors. They 
studied the city before them, ad- 
justing their heavy glass face- 
plates for telescopic vision. 

Capital City was plainly di- 
vided into two sections. The Reds 
dwelled on a hill at the far side 
of the harbor from the watching 
planeteers, .in an area sxuround- 
ed by a defensive wall. Their 
buildings were mainly of stone 
or mud brick, and a number of 
Blond servants could be seen 
going about various menial tasks. 

In the Blond section, on lower 
ground and closer to Brazil and 



42 



GALAXY 



Foley, no Reds were visible ex- 
cept for an occasional squad of 
patrolling soldiers. They stuck 
close together, looking grimly 
over their shoulders. The houses 
were built mostly of dried ground- 
vine mats, though some mud 
bricks were used. 

Beyond the Blond section 
were the docks. The water of 
the harbor was studded with the 
low shapes of fishing boats and, 
larger, a few of Galamand’s war 
galleys. 

“Well — shall we march?” 
asked Foley. 

“Might as well. I expect Ariton 
will know we're here before we’ve 
gone very far.” 

Brazil moved his legs. The suit 
servos drew power from the tiny 
hydrogen fusion lamp in the back- 
pack; the suit legs churned the 
massive shape ahead. The wearer 
had the sensation of moving in 
light summer clothing, but he 
could plow through heavy bush 
and small trees if he chose. 

Brazil and Foley had no wish 
to leave such a monstrous trail, 
so they picked their way with 
care to the nearest road and set 
out at a slow walk toward town. 

Ariton met them in a narrow 
street before they were well in- 
side the town. She stared at Foley 
hard when Brazil introduced him, 
but gave him a common greeting- 
word in a pleasant voice. 

“Sunto is waiting with a boat 



in the harbor,” she told them. 
“It is the shortest and easiest 
way to Galamand’s building.” 

The planeteers followed her 
through narrow winding streets 
toward the harbor, ever a center 
of apathetic, curious, hopeful, or 
poker-faced stares from the 
Blond slum-dwellers. None of the 
Red patrols came within sight. 
That suited Brazil fine. 

Sunto was waiting at a low 
dock, in a crude and lopsided row- 
boat fashioned of reeds plastered 
together with clay. 

“Hope the blasted thing can 
hold us,” said Foley on radio, try- 
ing to check his suit floats un- 
obtrusively. “It’d be a long swim 
from the middle of the harbor.” 

The sun was still bright in the 
morning sky, promising a warm 
day. Galamand’s castle rose for- 
bidding across the harbor, be- 
yond the fishing boats and the 
moored biremes of his navy. 
Above and beyond the castle rose 
the slender stone Tower of the 
Sea God. 

^HE rowboat held up as Sunto 
^ propelled it across the calm 
water of the harbor, straight to- 
ward the landing steps at the base 
of the castle. Reds appeared on 
the steps, watching. Their number 
grew as the boat approached. 

“Galamand will have heard of 
you, of course,” said Ariton. “I 
think he will be eager to see you 



PLANETEER 



43 



for himself. Of course he may 
decide to kill you.” She observed 
them. 

“I don’t think he will harm us,” 
said Foley. From inside heavy 
ground armor they could remon- 
strate gently but confidently with 
Galamand while he boiled them 
in oil or his cohorts attempted to 
bash in their faceplates with 
axes. It would require a local Ar- 
chimedes and considerable work 
for any primitive king to dam- 
age them seriously, inside of a 
days time. But Ariton wore not 
much of any clothes at all. 
Foley asked her; “Do you think 
you will be safe?” 

“The priestess of the Sea God 
is safe even from Galamand,” 
she answered absently. Brazil 
thought she was worried, but not 
about herself. 

A slight leak developed in the 
rowboat. Foley bailed rapidly 
with a leaky gourd, muttering 
exotic curses. 

Brazil scanned the ranks of 
grimly watching Reds as they 
neared the landing steps. “Is 
Galamand among those?” 

“I do not see him. No doubt 
he awaits you in the great hall 
inside.” 

The boat wallowed up to the 
landing. Ariton hopped nimbly 
out and made it fast with a rope 
of vine. A couple of Red soldiers 
made half-hearted motions of 
leveling spears in her direction. 



but no one moved to stop her. 
Brazil and Foley disembarked 
and stood quietly, giving the Reds 
the chance to look them over and 
make the first move if they felt 
like it. There were no women or 
children in sight. 

Ariton moved her hand in an 
intricate gesture, in the air 
above Sunto’s head; then touched 
his head briefly. 

“Now they will not bother him 
— for a while,” she said to Brazil. 
“Well, let us go on and try to see 
the king.” 

A sword-bearing Red who 
might be an army officer stepped 
forward. “King Galamand has 
been told that you are here. 
Stand and wait.” He eyed Foley 
with unconcealed and unfriendly 
curiosity. 

Some of the Red troops 
looked Brazil over and com- 
mented among themselves with 
openly truculent contempt. His 
blondness was plainly visible 
through the faceplate. He looked 
back at them, deadpan, un- 
obtrusively inflating his suit’s 
flotation bubbles. Giant red swell- 
ings ballooned out around his 
shoulders and torso. The soldiers 
stared and fell silent. 

“Brazil, what are you doing?” 
hissed a peremptory voice in his 
helmet. 

“All right, I guess it wasn’t 
funny.” He deflated the bubbles 
and tried to wait patiently. 



44 



GALAXY 



A FEW minutes passed in si- 
lence. Then a more elabo- 
rately costumed Red appeared, 
and imperiously beckoned the 
delegation to follow him into the 
castle. 

There were only a few Blonds 
inside the walls. They had the 
. look of prisoners or the lowest of 
slaves. Now a few Red women 
and children were in evidence, 
but they retreated rapidly out of 
sight of the visitors. The complex 
of walls and buildings making up 
the stronghold had been built of 
heavy stone, with little if any 
mortar used. But the stones were 
cut and fitted superbly, especially 
in the lower levels of the walls. 

The great hall was a high 
chamber about thirty yards by 
ten, dimly lit by smoking torches 
and small high windows. It was 
crowded with Red men of varied 
appearance. But across one end 
of the room stood a solid wall 
of tall soldiers bearing shields and 
leveled spears. 

“The old boy’s probably right 
behind his army,” Brazil radioed. 

“Stand and wait here,” said the 
distinguished Red who was act- 
ing guide, indicating a spot not far 
from the leveled spears. He dis- 
appeared into the crowd at one 
side. 

Brazil and Foley turned casu- 
ally around as they waited, study- 
ing the chamber and the Reds 
in it. No attempt had been made 



to surround the visitors at close 
quarters. The door by which they 
had entered still stood open. 
Ariton stood waiting between the 
planeteers, with utter calm. 

Another important-looking Red 
appeared before them; but it was 
somehow obvious that he was 
not the king. He held his hands 
clasped before him and owned a 
nose remarkable in size even for 
one of his tribe. 

“Do you bear weapons?” he 
demanded sharply, looking from 
Foley to Brazil. 

“We do,” said Foley. “And we 
are not the only men here who 
bear them.” He tried to give his 
speech the accent of a Red. 

“You must give me your weap- 
ons,” said the chamberlain. “Then 
you may advance and prostrate 
yourselves before the king.” 

“We will advance to greet the 
king in all friendliness,” said 
Foley. “But the law of our own 
nation forbids us to do homage 
to him or to give up our weapons.” 
The chamberlain hesitated a 
moment, then began to screech at 
the Earthmen threateningly, as if 
they were slaves. He raved and 
glared and waved his arms, and 
jabbered so fast he became almost 
unintelligible. Yet Brazil got the 
impression the man was trying to 
avoid direct personal insult. It 
was a masterful performance of 
denouncing their disrespectful be- 
havior but not themselves.

“Better just wait him out,” 
Brazil subvocalized to Foley via 
radio. “Maybe they just want to 
see if we bluff. It wouldn’t do 
for the king himself to fail.” 

T he planeteers stood silent a 
full thirty seconds longer, glar- 
ing stony-eyed back at the 
speaker. The harangue gave no 
sign of slackening. 

“Better squelch him,” Brazil 
said. Evidently the torrent of 
words was going to continue until 
they reacted to it in some way. 
Brazil did not now want to give 
the impression that Earthmen 
had infinite patience. The squelch 
might be better accepted coming 
from the “Red” planeteer. 

“Silence!” Foley bellowed, after 
turning up his airspeaker volume. 
He got what he called for with 
magical suddenness. Ariton wore 
a pleased smile. 

“We have come here to talk 
with a king, not to listen to you,” 
Foley went on. “If King Gala- 
mand is not pleased' to receive us 
today, we will return tomorrow. 
Our business is important.” 

“Get out of the way,” said a 
firm voice from behind the wall 
of soldiers. “Let them come here.” 
The rank of soldiers opened, 
but stayed within spear-thrusting 
distance on either side. Brazil, 
Ariton and Foley advanced to- 
ward the man who sat alone upon 
an ancient carven chair. 



The low dais and throne were 
nothing remarkable. The helmet 
and breastplate of the king were 
richer than those of his soldiers. 
Upon the breastplate was worked 
in relief an image of the Tower 
of the Sea God, the torchlight 
glinting on it. 

The man upon the throne was 
not ordinary. A vast scar sliced 
across his face, nearly obliterat- 
ing one of his eyes. He was ap- 
proaching middle age, not big 
for a Red, but thick-limbed and 
strong. 

Foley opened his mouth to say 
something a little nasty about 
the way the chamberlain had 
spoken to them. “Greetings, oh 
king,” was what came out. Gala- 
mand’s bright blue eye seemed 
to nail you with more effect than 
if there had been two. 

“Greetings, oh, king,” said 
Brazil. Ariton stood between the 
Earthmen, saying nothing and 
watching Galamand haughtily. 

The king ignored her and 
spoke to the armored planeteers, 
looking from one to the other. 
“I bid you welcome,” he said per- 
functorily. “Does your king send 
greetings to me?” 

“He does, indeed,” said Foley. 
“And would send you gifts, as is 
our custom.” He waited momen- 
tarily for a reaction which did 
not come, then added: “But in 
some lands it is considered an 
insult to present such gifts im- 



46 



GALAXY 



mediately. It is, indeed, so con- 
sidered by us.” 

The king raised an eyebrow, 
and his mouth twisted slightly. 
Some facial expressions seem to 
be well-nigh universal among 
humanoids, Brazil thought. He 
spoke up: “Oh, there are such 
lands. King Galamand. Not 
many, but a few.” 

The blue eye fixed on his. “I 
thank your king for his greet- 
ings. Is he Red or Blond?” 

“Neither,” said Brazil, truth- 
fully enough. “In our country 
there are men of many tribes, 
who live together fairly peace- 
fully. It is only by chance that I 
look like one of the Blonds of 
this island. But Foley here was 
chosen deliberately to come here 
today, because he looks like a 
Red, that you might not think 
we believe Reds to be our ene- 
mies.” 

The king nodded toward 
Ariton. “You bring this woman 
with you. Why?” 

“I have come with these my 
friends, to speak for my people,” 
she said, flaring up at him. “And 
I speak also to the Sea God, as 
you well know.” 

^ ALAMAND seemed faintly 
^^amused. “Do you speak against 
me to the Sea God, woman? Your 
words are not strong enough. The 
Tower still stands against the 
waves. The sea-sound is faint in 



my ear, and soothing as I go to 
sleep at night. Will you arouse 
the Sea God to destroy me?” 

Brazil heard the faintest stir 
and mutter among the soldiers 
on either side; evidently the 
king’s words might be thought a 
provocation to the God. Gala- 
mand swept his blue eye around, 
but said nothing to his men. 

He spoke again to the plane- 
teers: “And you are this woman’s 
friends?” 

“We would be friends with 
Red and Blond alike.” 

Galamand digested the state- 
ment swiftly and without com- 
ment, and changed the subject. 
“Your ship is swift and hard to 
see; my ships have circled the 
island every day since you first 
appeared, and have not found it. 
Yet at night it draws near, for 
you to land. And when you leave, 
your ship is not seen either. Now 
I admit this puzzles me.” 

“He may be convinced that 
you’re just castaways,” said a 
rapid whisper from the Yuan 
Chwang in Brazil’s^ ear, bringing 
him no news. 

He answered the king: “As you 
say, our ship is swift, and hard 
to see. It is not the wish of our 
king that our first visits here be 
seen by many ships upon the 
sea.” 

“And why do you come here 
at all?” 

“We seek always the knowledge

of new lands, oh king,” said Foley. 
“Some twenty or thirty of us 
would like to live on this island 
for a year or two, on some small 
area of land that you who live 
here now do not need. We are 
willing to pay for this privilege. 
But we are not willing to deal 
with a government engaged in 
civil war, under which two tribes 
contend against each other; or 
with a king who holds another 
tribe in slavery.” 

“No one contends against me 
here and lives.” Galamand spoke 
quietly and distinctly. He gave 
Ariton his twisted grin and asked; 
“Is it not so?” 

It stung her deeply, and her 
voice rose loud; “Your day is not 
forever, Redman. One day your 
children will be our slaves, if you 
beget any before you die. We 
will—” 

Brazil’s voice rose over hers. 
“That is not what we want! That 
would yet be war and slavery.” 
Both native rulers looked at 
him, for a moment united against 
the outsider. Then Galamand 
asked quietly; “How would you 
have us live?” 

“As one tribe.” 

Galamand narrowed his opera- 
tional eye and scratched his 
beard. “You spoke of payment, 
for the use of land. What do you 
mean to offer?” 

Foley answered; “To a just and 
peaceful ruler we would offer, to 



begin with, a great quantity of 
cord, stronger and more lasting 
than your vines, to make excellent 
fishnets, oh king.” 

“And weapons?” The king’s 
voice was casual and gentle. 

“A quantity of swords and 
spears might be included — ” 
“You do not carry swords or 
spears.” 

“We carry them for trade.” 
They could be made up. 

Galamand’s blue eye did not 
waver from Foley’s face, but his 
right arm shot out toward the 
nearest guard, and his fingers 
snapped. The haft of the guard’s 
spear was instantly in his grip. 

T he king stood up and thrust 
the spear, butt first, toward 
Foley, at the same time holding 
out this left hand open. 

“If you are men who deal in 
spears, then I will deal with you. 
I offer in trade this good Red 
spear, for that weapon you wear 
at your side.” 

Foley assumed an expression 
of deep trouble, and he answered 
reluctantly; “Oh king, we have no 
wish to anger you. But we must 
refuse to trade our weapons. If 
we did, the anger of our king 
would fall heavily upon our 
heads. And agaihst his anger we 
have no defense.” 

“And against mine?” Gala- 
mand’s voice was still gentle. So 
is a gorilla, when not offended.

GALAXY 



“We have our weapons, which 
we will not trade,” said Brazil, 
with utmost courtesy. The blue 
eye lanced at him, and he looked 
right back down the shaft of it, 
while from the corners of his eyes 
he watched the spearmen care- 
fully. He wondered if Galamand 
could really identify the butt of 
a stun pistol as a weapon. 

Galamand grounded the butt 
of the spear and stood drumming 
his fingers on the shaft. 

“Fishnets,” he said medita- 
tively. He looked from one 
planeteer to the other. “Your 
great king has then no weapons to 
spare? I would reward you well 
if you were to convince him that 
he has; or if you were to act, shall 
we say, on your own . .” He 
reached into a pouch at his side 
and brought out a lustrous pearl, 
bigger than a grape. 

Foley shook his head slowly, 
forgetting that the gesture might 
mean nothing or anything here. 
“Oh king, it cannot be so. If you 
offer us kingdoms greater and 
richer than this whole island, 
still we will give or trade to you 
no weapons, save such as you can 
make yourselves.” 

Galamand tossed the spear 
back to the soldier and seated 
himself again. 

“And your armor, I suppose? 
I admit I have not seen such 
glass.” 

This time Brazil joined in the 



headshaking, to preserve unity, 
since no one had seemed shocked 
by the gesture. 

“Strange men,” Galamand 
mused. “You say you will not 
trade with a ruler who holds 
another tribe in slavery. I will 
not ask you why. I have not 
asked for any trade with you that 
would pay me in fishnets, and 
I want none. While the waves 
spare the Tower, the Sea God 
supports me. I am king upon this 
island. My slaves are my slaves. 
When you are willing to trade 
something worth while for the 
use of my land, you may come 
again and speak with me.” 

“Suggestions?” Brazil radioed. 

“Leave without argument,” said 
a voice from above. “We can 
analyze what we’ve got and try 
again.” 

A RITON stood proudly erect 
while Brazil and Foley bow- 
ed deeply to the king, who told 
them with a straight face that 
he was providing them with an 
escort back to their ship, that no 
harm should come to them on the 
way. 

“They’ll see the scout unless 
we can shake them,” Brazil ra- 
dioed, starting out of the throne 
room. 

“Guess maybe we’ll have to 
give them a minimum marvel to 
look at,” said Gates’ voice. 
“There’s a suitable deep cove 



PLANETEER 



49 



just outside the city, about two 
miles from where you are. Just 
walk south along the shore; I’ll 
bring the scout up partly out 
of the water for you to get in, 
and let them get a good enough 
look to be sure it’s a ship and 
not a sea monster. Okay?” 

“Good idea,” said Captain 
Dietrich. “A submarine will ex- 
plain to them why they haven’t 
seen our ship. It’ll startle them 
some, but it should further con- 
vince them we’re not spirits who 
just materialize.” 

Ariton walked with the plane- 
teers out of the castle; they 
stopped at the landing steps to 
pick up Sunto, who was much 
relieved to see them. 

Sunto ceased bailing and 
climbed out of his rowboat when 
told they were leaving by land. 
He said to a Red soldier stand- 
ing guard nearby: “I leave to 
you as a gift the noble craft 
which you have praised so 
highly.” And he ground his foot 
against the stone stair. The Red 
glowered but said nothing. 

The walk out of the city was 
uneventful. Within an hour the 
four of them stood on the steep 
sloping shore within the chosen 
cove, with Galamand’s heavily 
armed honor guard watching very 
carefully from a little distance 
and a Red galley casually stand- 
ing by off shore. 

Foley was telling Ariton that 



a ship would soon come to take 
Brazil and him aboard, but she 
and Sunto would have to stay on 
shore. She agreed calmly, and 
watched the horizon for the ship, 
with some puzzlement. ^ 

Brazil turned to Sunto. “The 
Tower of the Sea God is very 
important to your people and the 
Reds, is it not?” 

“Yes.” Sunto did not seem espe- 
cially interested in the subject. 

“It is our old belief that as long 
as the Tower is not destroyed by 
the waves of the sea, the Sea 
God smiles upon the rulers of the 
island, whoever they be.” 

“What if the waves should 
knock the Tower down?” Brazil 
asked. 

Sunto smiled wryly. “Then I 
think you would see upon this 
island the one tribe for which 
Ariton says you asked the king. , 
For the Tower to be so destroyed 
would mean the Sea God thinks 
the rulers of the island evil. The 
destruction of his own Tower is 
to be his last warning before he 
overwhelms with waves the entire 
island, slaying everyone on it and 
carrying the evildoers down to | 
be frozen forever in the ice at 
the bottom of the sea.” 

“Get more on this, Boris,” said 
an excited radio voice. “Ask 
Ariton about the Tower, Foley. 
She should be the real authority. 1 
Gates, hold that scout imderwater I 
for a minute.” i 



B razil asked Simto; “Do you 
think the Sea God will ever 
destroy the Tower?” 

Sunto looked out at the ocean 
soberly; it was dull and placid 
in the sun. 

“May I never see the day — 
but I am a practical man. Who- 
ever is king will surely see to it 
that the sea wall of large rocks 
is kept strong at the base of the 
Tower, to break the force of the 
waves. Some day, perhaps, a very 
great storm . but there are 
great storms every year. The 
Tower has stood for many 
years.” 

“Is the season for great storms 
coming soon?” Brazil felt the 
vague beginnings of what might 
be a valid idea. 

“No, it is just past. Now is the 
time of the steady-but-not-too- 
strong winds.” 

“Oh. I see.” 

“That checks,” said Meteoro- 
logy from above. 

Sunto continued: “Also, the 
Tower stands on a straight shore- 
line, and the Sea God hurls his 
waves most strongly against the 
points of land that jut out into his 
domain, as if he were jealous.” 
“That is true in all lands,” said 
Brazil absently. He had just 
the start of a plan to get these 
people co-operating, by somehow 
making the Tower seem threaten- 
ed by a storm, and scaring them. 
It might be just possible to in- 



duce a violent storm. But what 
would it do to the rest of the 
island? The scheme seemed 
worthless . 

“That is true in all lands. As 
it is true that the waves come 
in nearly always parallel to the 
shore, no matter from which point 
at sea the wind is blowing. And 
the reason is the same . Brazil 
fell silent, as if in a sudden 
dream. 

“Why, that is so, but I have 
never thought about it,” said 
Sunto in surprise. “Truly, the 
waves are like women, for men 
watch them long and understand 
them but little.” 

“ . that they travel more 
slowly as the water beneath them 
grows more shallow,” said Brazil 
with a far-away look. He gave a 
sudden laugh at the sight of 
Sunto’s startled face. “Waves, I 
mean, not women. Sunto, tell me 
this. If the Tower were destroyed 
by some means other than the 
waves, what then?” 

“What then?” Sunto gave the 
Blond equivalent of a shrug. 
“Why, the Tower would simply 
have to be rebuilt, and the king 
would gain merit in the Sea God’s 
eyes by rebuilding.” He thought 
for a moment. “Maybe the Red 
king would rebuild it on some in- 
land hill, where no wave could 
ever reach it, and so make his 
rule safe.” 

Brazil nodded as if satisfied.

^^WENTY minutes later he sat 
with Foley in scoutship Alpha, 
gratefully peeling off gadgets and 
chunks of armor. He faced on a 
segmented screen the debriefing 
assembly of their peers and 
bosses, electronically gathered to 
analyze the visit to Galamand. 
The astounded natives who had 
watched the two planeteers enter 
the submarine craft were by now 
no doubt attendiiig their own 
conferences on the subject. 

“First, just tell me this,” Brazil 
invited, eyes alight with an idea. 
“Does it seem likely that a mas- 
sive assault of ocean waves on 
this Tower might make these 
people willing to try getting along 
together, at least for a while, 
so we could deal with a halfway 
representative government?” 

“I would say yes, based on what 
Ariton told me,” said Foley. 

“I would tend to agree,” said 
Sociology, cautiously. “It might 
well give us a start in the right 
direction.” 

“An assault of ocean waves, 
you say.” Captain Dietrich 
frowned. “Not of forcefields, ex- 
plosives, chemicals or sonic vibra- 
tions.” 

“Captain, I think there’s a 
chance it can be done with this 
scoutship, and not by directing 
any of those modern weapons 
against the Tower.” 

“I am afraid I would have to 
forbid tbe use of such weapons 



against the natives, on principle,” 
said Chandragupta grimly. 

“The idea is not to wreck the 
Tower,” said Brazil, “but to make 
the natives think the Sea God 
has decided to wreck it.” 

“That Galamand’s no fool,” 
said Gates. “He’s probably think- 
ing up antisubmarine devices al- 
ready. And how are you going to 
stir up suitable waves with a 
scoutship?” 

“I’m not going to stir them up, 
exactly. And I don’t think Gala- 
mand will notice a submarine 
acting several miles out at sea, 
away from his Tower.” 

“Are you drunk?” 

“No, on duty. Another reason 
for trying to get this situation 
settled. Now I’ll need some in- 
formation before I can tell if 
this scheme has a chance of work- 
ing.” 

Late that afternoon a cute 
chick who happened to be an ex- 
pert oceanographer gave Brazil 
data he had requested. He 
studied it for a few moments, 
then favored the girl’s screen 
image with a look like that of 
an elated predator. 

“Baby, I think I could kiss 
you.” 

“Your threats don’t frighten 
me at this distance,” she an- 
swered, unperturbed. “Is there 
anything else you want — having 
to do with the job, that is?” 

He turned serious. “Now I 



52 



GALAXY 



need a weather forecast of such 
massive solidity that we can all 
lean on it — one that includes 
a steady ocean breeze here.” 

T ROFAND, Red priest of the 
Sea God, and chief caretak- 
er of the Tower, was awakened 
by the sound of the waves, to 
which he listened with half an 
ear even while asleep. The sound 
was now too loud for his liking. 

He arose from his pallet and 
was dressing in the stone-damp 
darkness of his chamber in the 
Tower’s base when he received 
a shock. A streaming puddle of 
cold sea water flowed against his 
bare foot on the floor. He 
hastened to light a candle from 
the smoldering brazier that fought 
uselessly against the permanent 
dampness of his bedchamber. 

It was true, he saw with dis- 
tress. Water was entering in thin 
streams through chinks in the 
massive masonry of the inner 
Tower wall. It was something 
that happened only in the 
heaviest storms. The booming 
roar of the waves pounding the 
heavy sea wall outside brought 
him to the beginning of real 
fright. In ten years in the Tower 
he had never heard it so .loud. A 
mighty storm must be raging, 
though the season for them was 
past, and the weather signs had 
given no indication of any ap- 
proaching tempest. 



Trofand was nearly dressed 
when an underling came with a 
torch, pounding on his door and 
opening it with a minimum of 
courtesy. 

“My lord, the waves, the waves! 
They are very bad!” 

“I have ears, fool. Someone 
should have called me sooner. 
What are the signs of the storm’s 
length?” 

“My lord, there is no storm.” 

Trofand started an angry retort 
to the foolish statement, but some- 
thing in the pale frightened face 
before him made him pause. Fas- 
tening his belt, he led the way out 
of the chamber to the stair that 
climbed to the Tower’s top. He 
could soon see for himself what 
was happening. 

It was true, he realized, emerg- 
ing into the pre-dawn darkness 
atop the Tower. The sky was 
clear. The wind was steady in di- 
rection from the sea, but it was 
not strong. The surf at the 
Tower’s foot should be fairly 
gentle. 

He thought he felt the stones 
of the Tower quiver underfoot 
with each leisurely watery smash. 

An assistant was at his elbow, 
speaking with a worried voice. 
“My lord, what shall we do? The 
signs are that the wind will rise 
throughout the day, and remain 
steady in direction. If the waves 
become yet higher — ” 

“If they do, we will deal with 



PLANETEER

them. The Sea God is not our 
enemy. Go rouse out the Tower 
slaves. Conscript more if need be. 
Have them . stand by the fresh 
slabs of rock, ready at dawn to 
strengthen the sea wall. Then go 
you to offer the day’s sacrifice to 
the Sea God. But do not take 
too long about it.” 

“I obey.” The man was gone in 
an instant, down the stair. Other 
junior priests of the Tower hud- 
dled about Trofand in the chill 
night, in the light of a dim torch, 
looking to him for guidance. 

W ELL, I was right about that, 
Trofand said to himself. He 
was thinking of the extra stones, 
weighing many tons apiece, that 
he had long ago ordered to be 
kept on rollers in the court- 
yard below. They were constantly 
ready to be moved to reinforce 
the sea wall in case a storm of 
unprecedented violence should 
threaten the Tower. 

But now he had a question to 
decide immediately. Should he 
order the king awakened? After 
all, the Tower seemed in no im- 
mediate danger. Galamand might 
grumble if he were waked up for 
something unimportant. But he 
might have the man boiled alive 
who failed to wake him for a real 
emergency, priest of the Sea God 
or not. It was not a hard decision 
to make. 

“You — go rouse the king. Tell 



him I say that waves threaten 
the Tower. Tell no one else.” 

“I obey.” 

King Galamand was beside 
Trofand within a few minutes, 
looking over the parapet and 
frowning at the strange intensity 
of waves that were driven 
by such a modest wind. He ob- 
served the preparations that had 
been made to reinforce the sea 
wall at dawn, then turned and 
struck his fist against the parapet, i 
“You did well to call me. But i 
these stones have stood through- ! 
out my lifetime, and I say that 
they will stand yet a good while 
longer.” Trofand saw him out- 
lined against the first gray light , 
in the east. i 

The Blond slaves, whipped on j 
by overseers, now began to roll 
the mighty rock slabs into posi- | 
tion to reinforce the sea wall. It ! 
would be dangerous work. But j 
slaves could be replaced, while | 
the Tower — | 

There was an outcry some- j 
where inside the Tower. In a ■ 
minute an exhausted runner ap- 
peared, helped up the stairs by 
others. He leaned against the 
stones beside the king in near 
panic. 

“My lord, the sea wall — the 
wall away from the Tower, up 
and down the peninsula — ” 

“Is it breached by waves? 
Where?” 

“No, my lord.” A gasp for 



54 



GALAXY 



breath. “I came along the wall, 
after carrying your message con- 
scripting slaves — ” 

‘Well?” 

“Elsewhere, my lord, the waves 
are small. Only here at the Tower 
do they rise abnormally, as if in 
raging anger. As if the Sea God 
has grown angry and — uh!” 
Galamand’s vicious backhand 
blow knocked the man sprawling. 
“Enough! Do not preach the anger 
of the gods at me, or I will show 
you what anger is! I am the king!” 
The king turned away to peer, 
with Trofand and the others, at 
the waves beating against the sea 
wall at a distance from the 
Tower. The fast brightening dawn 
revealed that the messenger had 
spoken the truth. 

^THE NEWS was out, Brazil 
saw, as he strode along the 
sea wall road toward the Tower 
and the fortified complex of Gala- 
mand’s castle. A puzzled Ariton 
walked between him and Foley. 
Reds and Blonds stood in little 
groups along the wall, comment- 
ing on the waves that were as- 
saulting the base of the Tower. 
Faces turned toward them as 
they passed, but ever turned back 
again to the greater wonder of the 
waves. 

Each long swell marched in 
from the clear horizon of the 
ocean, foaming up and curling 
over as the depth of the water 



below approaching the height of 
the wave, to smash itself finally 
against the rocks piled in the 
shallow water at the base of the 
sea wall. But in the sea before 
the Tower, each incoming rise 
of water seemed to squeeze it- 
self together along its long axis, 
rising to at last three times the 
height of the waves elsewhere, 
before it piled up in a foaming 
fury of discriminating violence 
upon that part of the sea wall. 

Ariton paused at her first sight 
of this, whispering something that 
might have been a prayer. 

“You knew of this?” she asked 
Brazil. “This is why you brought 
me here?” 

“I’m taking you to talk to Gala- 
mand,” Brazil evaded. “I think 
if you and he can’t come to some 
peaceful agreement soon, there 
won’t be any Tower left for either 
of you to use. You have lived 
near the sea all your life. You 
know the strength that is in large 
waves.” 

“What do you mean?” she 
stared at him, half afraid. “Do you 
speak for the Sea God?” 

“We are only men,” he answer- 
ed innocently. “But do I not un- 
derstand your gods correctly? Is 
it not so that the Sea God may 
destroy his own Tower when 
there is great strife in the land 
and evil rulers, as a final warning 
to all the people, before he des- 
troys the entire island?”

“It is true the Reds are evil 
rulers,” she said after a long mo- 
ment, as if thinking aloud. Then 
she took her eyes from Brazil’s 
face and turned toward the 
Tower. “Come, whoever you are. 
It is my place to be there now.” 
“Is this going to work?” Foley 
radioed while they walked. “I 
mean that Tower isn’t built out 
of pebbles, exactly. And it’s 
stood through a lot of storms.” 
“On Earth,” answered Brazil 
in professorial accents, “wave 
forces have been measured at 
well over three tons per square 
foot. Engineers will not build a 
shoreline structure on Earth 
without carefully considering 
local conditions regarding the 
effect we are now employing. 

“Besides, the idea is to scare 
Galamand and the little lady 
here into co-operating, not to 
actually wreck the Tower. That 
would probably kill someone, 
and I hate to think what might 
happen in the panic.” 

A T the castle gate, the guards 
seemed almost to be looking 
over their shoulders at the Tower 
as they halted the three visitors 
and sent word to Galamand of 
their arrival. Everyone in sight. 
Red or Blond, was obviously 
thinking or talking of nothing but 
the waves. 

Within a few minutes, a guide 
appeared to escort the visitors 



to the bare top of the Tower. 

Brazil could see by the flags 
above the castle that the wind 
had increased slightly and was 
holding a steady direction, as 
Meteorology had promised it 
would. If we were only gods 
enough to control the winds in an 
area of a few square miles, 
thought Brazil. We can come a 
hundred light years to stick our 
noses into our neighbors’ busi- 
ness, but if the weather doesn’t 
quite suit our schemes when we 
arrive, we can only wait until 
it does. 

Galamand scoured them with 
his single eye when they had 
climbed the stairs to the Tower’s 
top. The king paused in his pacing 
amid a group of high-ranking 
Reds. 

“Come you to preach the Sea 
God to me also?” he inquired in 
an ominously quiet voice. 

Ariton looked about her. 
“Where is Trofand?” 

“He has gone to offer sacri- 
fices in the chapel below,” said 
the king, with a tinge of amuse- 
ment in his voice. He leaned 
against the parapet with thick 
arms folded and his back to the 
sea as if in contempt. “He has 
rather suddenly remembered to 
take his religious obligations se- 
riously.” 

“A human sacrifice?” asked 
Brazil. He hadn’t counted on this. 

“He considers it,” said Gala- 



PLAN ETEER 



57 




mand. “But I think the Sea God 
has lives enough for one day.” 
He moved his head to indicate 
that they should look over the 
parapet. 

In the cold boiling hell of 
surf at the Tower’s foot a hun- 
dred Blond slaves struggled on 
the slippery rocks, straining on 
levers and vine ropes to move 
an enormous block of stone into 
the surf at a place where the 
waves had weakened the wall. 

With each torrential ebb and 
surge of water, Brazil saw, a pale 
object in the surf was drawn out 
and hurled in near the rocks, 
buried in foam and tossed up 
again — a fish-pale thing that had 
blond hair and no longer any 
face. And there was another — 
and another . 

No Blond slave or Red over- 
seer took any apparent notice 
of the drowned men, much less 
attempted to pull them from the 
sea. Every living man down 
there was concerned too intently 
with his own footing on the 
treacherous rock. 

“Take it easy, old man,” said 
a voice inside Brazil’s helmet. 

/^H, THIS Brazil is a wonder, a 
red-hot planeteer, said a 
louder voice inside Brazil’s mind. 
Just trust him, and he’ll come 
up with a great scheme to set 
everyone on the road to happi- 
ness without bloodshed. That’s 



important, no bloodshed. Well, 
you can’t see any blood down 
there, can you? 

Now that’s enough. Shut up 
and get to work, there’s a job to 
finish. 

“Why does the surf attack only 
the place of the Tower, oh king?” 
he asked, turning, stony-faced. 

The blue eye studied him. 
“Had I a ship so cunningly built 
as to travel underwater, I might 
discover why.” Galamand turned 
to his aides. “Send boats and 
divers out beyond the white 
water. See if anything strange 
lies under the surface.” 

“The old boy’s uncomfortably 
shrewd,” said Foley on radio. 
“Doesn’t seem likely they’ll 
search the bottom five miles out 
and a couple hundred feet deep, 
though.” 

Boats and divers soon appear- 
ed in the sea a few hundred 
yards out from the Tower, and 
made a show of investigating 
underwater conditions. It was not 
a really dangerous job for such 
skillful sailors and swimmers, out 
there where there were no rocks 
to be dashed against. But the Red 
seamen seemed to approach the 
job with a vast reluctance. Their 
faces turned often toward the 
Tower, as if in hope that the 
king would recall them. 

Time passed. By noon the wind 
was obviously gaining strength 
again. 



“I go to join Trofand in the 
chapel,” said Ariton to the king, 
as if daring him to stop her. He 
pulled at his beard and appeared 
not to hear. 

When she had gone he ordered 
food brought to him. His aides 
grew continually more gloomy. 
They looked often at the king, 
but sought to avoid his eye. 

Galamand was amused to see 
the planeteers drink their lunch 
from tubes inside their helmets. 
He asked if their suits had sani- 
tary facilities too, and roared with 
laughter when he was told they 
had. But the laughter had a 
forced sound to skillful ears. 

The wind grew yet stronger, 
though it was still far from a 
: gale. Down below, an incoming 
wave got under a forty-ton slab 
of rock just right, and skipped it 
like a flat chip against the base 
of the Tower itself. Slaves and 
overseers miraculously scrambled 
clear. Stones split and flew; one 
1 fragment spun almost to the 
Tower’s top. 

The next wave poured through 
the gap in the sea wall, like the 
paw of a giant beast forced into 
a hole to grope for prey. The 
next tore free another huge stone 
from the edge of the hole. The 
bones of the Tower quivered. 

Slaves and masters at the 
Tower’s foot scrambled desper- 
ately to move another massive 
rock into a defensive position. 



Brazil saw it was a futile thing 
for creatures weak as men to 
attempt. One roaring curl of 
water caught a Red, who dropped 
his whip and grabbed at the 
slippery rock to save himself. 
Brazil saw the upturned face, 
the eyes seemingly looking 
straight into his own, the mouth 
opened as if to yell something. 
The next wave tore the man away 
and dragged him out of sight. 

ALAMAND was roaring 
'^orders for more slaves to be 
brought. “You have strange 
powers and weapons,” he de- 
manded suddenly of Foley. “Can 
you help me now?” 

Brazil pulled himself out of a 
hideous fascination with what 
was happening down below. 

“And if we can?” asked Foley. 

“It might be that the agree- 
ment you sought with me could 
be quickly reached.” The wind 
tore at Galamand’s words, and 
shot spray past his head, here 
ninety feet above the normal sea. 
A small wave-tossed rock clat- 
tered against the parapet, as if 
shot from a giant’s sling. 

“Then order those men from 
the sea down there,” Brazil de- 
manded. “And give your word to 
make of Red and Blond one 
tribe.” 

“Then you can cure this,” 
barked the king. “And it may be 
you have caused it!”

The other Reds glared at the 
Earthmen; some weapons were 
drawn. Then cries came from the 
stairway, distracting attention. 

Ariton and Trofand were sud- 
denly at the top of the stair, in 
ceremonial robes half sodden with 
sea water. 

“My king, the Sea God pours 
his wrath into the very chapel. 

I — ” Trofand jumped back, as 
if he thought the king’s sudden 
lunge was directed at him. But 
Galamand seized Ariton, had her 
arm twisted behind her back and 
his dagger at her throat in a 
moment. 

“Sacrilege! Sacrilege!” howled 
Trofand. The other Reds looked 
on, wavering, wide-eyed, un- 
decided. 

The king swung Ariton to face 
the planeteers. “Now, aliens,” he 
roared. “Cause the waves to cease, 
and quickly, or I will butcher this 
so-called queen with whom you 
ally yourselves. You seek to put 
her on a throne, but I alone am 
king. And so I will remain!” 

“My lord.” Ariton’s low voice 
stopped the king in surprise. 
Doubtless it was the first time 
she had used any title of respect 
to him. “My death will not save 
our island. But I will marry you 
and bear your sons, if that be 
the only way to save it. And we 
will live here as one tribe.” 

For the first time in his ex- 
perience, Brazil saw Galamand 



taken aback. But it was only for 
a moment. 

“No, I’ll not have it! I am the 
king here, I alone. Not you, or 
the aliens, or the Sea God him-, 
self, can order me, do this or 
that!” 

Trofand moaned and covered 
his face; every other Red was 
visibly shaken by the king’s de- 
fiance of the god. He’s weaken- 
ing, Brazil thought, with a sudden 
turn of sympathy for Galamand, 
and he’s cutting himself off from 
his followers. Be ready for the 
moment ... 

The sea-flung stone, the size of 
a grapefruit, actually missed 
Galamand’s helmeted head by 
less than a foot, and flew on to 
bounce off the opposite wall and 
down the stairway. The jolt from 
Brazil’s quick-drawn stun pistol 
took the king in the head about 
one second later, when all eyes 
were on Galamand. No native 
doubted that the rock had grazed 
the king’s helmet and caused his 
sudden collapse. Brazil’s pistol 
was reholstered as quickly as it 
had been drawn. 

The Red priests and soldiers 
stared at the fallen ruler in awe 
Plainly he had been struck down 
for blasphemy. None of then 
moved to aid him. 

t^OLEY went to him, pullin) 
out his first-aid kit and begin 
ning a quick radio conference 



with the medics of the Yuan 
Chwang. The stun-jolt should 
wear off in a matter of minutes; 
a carefully chosen tranquillizer 
administered now should ease the 
situation then considerably. 

A Red officer of apparent high 
rank -spoke almost imploringly to 
Trofand: “We will obey you, my 
lord. Is there any way to save 
the island?” The priest looked 
uncertainly at Ariton. 

Brazil asked her: “Will you now 
marry the king, as you offered, 
and so unite your people with 
his?” 

She rubbed the arm that Gala- 
mand had twisted, and frowned. 
“There is no need for that now. 
The Sea God has rejected him. 
With your help, I will be ruler — ” 

“Do you want the Tower to 
stand?” Brazil cut her off 
brutally. “Remember, too, that 
the Red soldiers are still strong, 
and perhaps not eager to serve 
you.” 

She nodded, meekly wide-eyed 
for once. 

Brazil turned to Trofand. “Can 
the marriage be done at once? 
As soon as the king awakes?” 

“If he can be made to agree 
to it; I see that the Sea God 
has spared his life, for now his 
eyelids move.” 

“I think he can be made to 
agree,” said the high-ranking of- 
ficer, grimly. “I think it is time 
we had a certain heir to the 



throne, and also an end to this 
unprofitable fighting in our own 
land.” 

Brazil switched off his air 
speaker, with throat muscles be- 
ginning to quiver with the relaxa- 
tion of tension. “Sam, start cut- 
ting down that hump. But better 
stand by to rebuild, until I give 
you the word that the honey- 
moon has started.” 

Five miles out at the sea and 
two hundred feet below the sur- 
face, scoutships Alpha and Omi- 
CTon braced themselves on water- 
filled space, and thrust noses 
equipped with jury-rigged bull- 
dozer blades against the mound 
of mud and sand rising from the 
bottom, the mound they had care- 
fully constructed in the same 
manner the day before. It was 
not much of a mound for size, 
really, and unimpressive-looking 
to any but an oceanographer. But 
it shallowed the water above it, 
and so it slowed the waves, re- 
fracting those from one certain 
direction, focussing them as a 
lens treats light, causing them to 
converge on one small area five 
miles away . 

130RIS BRAZIL opened his 

eyes. He had not been asleep, 
though he sat slouched in an 
easy chair in an alcove of the re- 
creation lounge aboard the Yuan 
Chwang. Chandragupta was 
standing looking down at him.

“Do you mind if I ask what 
you see behind your eyelids, my 
friend?” the Tribune asked. 

Brazil was not quick to answer. 

“Perhaps you see drowned 
men.” The Tribune sat down 
facing Brazil and spoke with 
quiet sympathy. “My friend, you 
have what must be one of the 
most difficult jobs in the known 
universe; you must be a re- 
searcher, a diplomat, a fighter, 
a linguist and a survival expert, 
by turns or all at once. And I 
know I have left out many things. 
I think you do very well in your 
job, considering that you are no 
more than human. We here 
agreed that your plan of threaten- 
ing the Tower with waves should 
be tried. I still think it was good. 
It has set the islanders on the 
road to unity, and so no doubt 
averted more suffering than it 
caused. The next time a similar 
situation arises, no doubt it can 
be used with even greater suc- 
cess.” 

“Thanks, Chan. I can’t help 
feeling we could have avoided 



getting those men drowned — but 
there’s no use brooding on it 
now.” Brazil uncoiled slowly up 
from the chair to stretch. A little 
humor came back into his face. 

“I’m going to play it as lazy as 
I can for a couple of days.” He 
straightened his off-duty semi- 
uniform, and said, half to himself: 
“Maybe I’ll just mosey over to- 
ward Oceanography and look up 
something. Hmmm — ” 

“Boris?” Foley’s voice was 
heard before he came into sight 
“There you are. Scout just sent 
back word from over nightside; 
they spotted one of those lumin- 
ous water-rings over there, this 
one’s eight miles across. Our reg- 
ular standby crew is out, so Gates 
wants you in the briefing room on 
the double. Oh yeah — ” Foley 
gave the uncertain smile of the 
bearer of a joke who doesn’t un- 
derstand it. “He says: “What 
would Thoreau have to say about 
that?”’ 

Brazil’s answer was probably 
inaccurate.

G UMMITCH peered 

thoughtfully at the molten 
silver image of the sun in 
his little bowl of water on the 
floor inside the kitchen window. 
He knew from experience that it 
would make dark ghost suns swim 
in front of his eyes for a few 
moments, and that was mildly in- 
teresting. Then he slowly thrust 
his head put over the water, care- 
ful not to ruffle its surface by 



rough breathing, and stared down 
at the mirror cat — the Gummitch 
Double — staring up at him. 

Gummitch had early discovered 
that water mirrors are very differ- 
ent from most glass mirrors. The 
scentless spirit world behind glass 
mirrors is an upright one sharing 
our gravity system, its floor a 
continuation of the floor in the so- 
called real world. But the world 
in a water mirror has reverse

gravity. One looks down into it, 
but the spirit-doubles in it look 
up at one. In a way water mirrors 
are holes or pits in the world, 
leading down to a spirit infinity 
or ghostly nadir. 

Gummitch had pondered as to 
whether, if he plunged into such 
a pit, he would be sustained by 
the spirit gravity or fall forever. 
(It may well be that speculations 
of this sort account for the caution 
about swimming characteristic of 
most cats.) 

There was at least one excep- 
tion to the general rule. The look- 
ing glass on Kitty-Come-Here’s 
dressing table also opened into a 
spirit world of reverse gravity, as 
Gummitch had discovered when 
he happened to look into it during 
one of the regular visits he made 
to the dressing table top, to enjoy 
the delightful flowery and musky 
odors emanating from the fragile 
bottles assembled there. 

But exceptions to general rules, 
as Gummitch knew well, are only 
doorways to further knowledge 
and finer classifications. The wind 
could not get into the spirit world 
below Kitty-Come-Here’s looking 
glass, while one of the definitive 
characteristics of water mirrors is 
that movement can very easily 
enter the spirit world below them, 
rhythmically disturbing it through- 
out, producing the most surreal 
effects, and even reducing it to 
chaos. Such disturbances exist 



only in the spirit world and are 
in no way a mirroring of anything 
in the real world: Gummitch 
knew that his paw did not change 
when it flicked the surface of the 
water, although the image of his 
paw burst into a hundred flicker- 
ing fragments. (Both cats and 
primitive men first deduced that 
the world in a water mirror is a 
spirit world because they saw that 
its inhabitants were easily blown 
apart by the wind and must there- 
fore be highly tenuous, though 
capable of regeneration.) 

Gummitch mildly enjoyed cre- 
ating rhythmic disturbances in the 
spirit worlds below water mirrors. 
He wished there were some way 
to bring their excitement and 
weird beauty into the real world. 

this sunny day when our 
story begins, the spirit world 
below the water mirror in his 
drinking bowl was particularly 
vivid and bright. Gummitch 
stared for a while longer at the 
Gummitch Double and then 
thrust down his tongue to quench 
his thirst. Curling swiftly upward, 
it conveyed a splash of water into 
his mouth and also flicked a single 
drop of water into the air before 
his nose. The sun struck the drop 
and it flashed like a diamond. In 
fact, it seemed to Gummitch that 
for a moment he had juggled the 
sun on his tongue. He shook his 
head amazedly and touched the 



64 



GALAXY 



side of the bowl with his paw. 
The bowl was brimful and a few 
drops fell out; they also flashed 
like tiny suns as they fell. Gum- 
mitch had a fleeting vision, a 
momentary creative impulse, that 
was gone from his mind before 
he could seize it. He shook his 
head once more, backed away 
from the bowl, and then lay down 
with his head pillowed on his 
paws to contemplate the matter. 
The room darkened as the sun 
went under a cloud and the young 
golden dark-barred cat looked 
like a pool of sunlight left behind. 

Kitty-Come-Here had watched 
the whole performance from the 
door to the dining room and that 
evening she commented on it to 
Old Horsemeat. 

“He backed away from the 
water as if it were poison,” she 
said. “They have been putting 
more chlorine in it lately, you 
know, and maybe he can taste 
the fluorides they put in for den- 
tal decay.” 

Old Horsemeat doubted that, 
but his wife went on, “I can’t fig- 
ure out where Gummitch does his 
drinking these days. There never 
seems to be any water gone from 
his bowl. And we haven’t had any 
cut flowers. And none of the fau- 
cets drip.” 

“He probably does his drinking 
somewhere outside,” Old Horse- 
meat guessed. 

“But he doesn’t go outside very 
KREATIVITY FOR KATS 



often these days,” Kitty-Come- 
Here countered. “Scarface and the 
Mad Eunuch, you know. Besides, 
it hasn’t rained for weeks. It’s cer- 
tainly a mystery to me where he 
gets his liquids. Boiling gets the 
chlorine out of water, doesn’t it? 
I think I’ll try him on some to- 
morrow.” 

“Maybe he’s depressed,” Old 
Horsemeat suggested. “That often 
leads to secret drinking.” 

This baroque witticism hit 
fairly close to the truth. Gum- 
mitch was depressed — had been 
depressed ever since he had lost 
his kittenish dreams of turning 
into a man, achieving spaceflight, 
learning and publishing all the 
secrets of the fourth dimension, 
and similar marvels. The black 
cloud of disillusionment at real- 
izing he could only be a cat had 
lightened somewhat, but he was 
still feeling dull and unfulfilled. 

Gummitch was at that difficult 
age for he-cats, between First 
Puberty, when the cat achieves 
essential maleness, and Second 
Puberty, when he gets broad- 
chested, jowly and thick-ruffed, 
becoming a fully armed sexual 
competitor. In the ordinary course 
of things he would have been 
spending much of his time explor- 
ing the outer world, detail-map- 
ping the immediate vicinity, spy- 
ing on other cats, making cautious 
approaches to unescorted females 
and in all ways comporting him-

self like a fledgling male. But this 
was prevented by the two burly 
toms who lived in the houses next 
door and who, far more interested 
in murder than the pursuit of 
mates, had entered into partner- 
ship with the sole object of bush- 
wacking Gummitch. Gummitch’s 
household had nicknamed them 
Scarface and the Mad Eunuch, 
the latter being one of those 
males whom “fixing” turns, not 
placid, but homicidally maniacal. 
Compared to these seasoned 
heavyweights, Gummitch was a 
welterweight at most. Scarface 
and the Mad Eunuch lay in wait 
for him by turns just beyond the 
kitchen door, so that his forays 
into the outside world were large- 
ly reduced to dashes for some 
hiding hole, followed by long, 
boring but perilous sieges. 

He often wished that old Horse- 
meat’s two older cats, Ashurbani- 
pal and Cleopatra, had not gone 
to the country to live with Old 
Horsemeat’s mother. They would 
have shown the evil bushwackers 
a thing or two! 

¥>ECAUSE of Scarface and the 
Mad Eunuch, Gummitch 
spent most of his time indoors. 
Since a cat is made for a half-and- 
half existence — half in the wild 
forest, half in the secure cave — 
he took to brooding quite mor- 
bidly. He thought over-much of 
ghost cats in the mirror world and 



of the Skeleton Cat who starved 
to death in a locked closet and 
similar grisly legends. He im- 
mersed himself in racial memo- 
ries, not so much of Ancient Egypt 
where cats were prized as minions 
of the lovely cat-goddess Bast and 
ceremoniously mummified at the 
end of tranquil lives, as of the 
Middle Ages, when European 
mankind waged a genocidal war 
against felines as being the fa- 
miliars of witches. (He thought 
briefly of turning Kitty-Come- 
Here into a witch, but his hyp- 
notic staring and tentative ritual- 
istic mewing only made her 
fidgety.) And he devoted more 
and more time to devising dark 
versions of the theory of trans- 
migration, picturing cats as Silent 
Souls, Gagged People of Great 
Talent, and the like. 

He had become too self-con- 
scious to re-enter often the make- 
believe world of the kitten, yet his 
imagination remained as active as 
ever. It was a truly frustrating 
predicament. 

More and more often and for 
longer periods he retired to medi- 
tate in a corrugated cardboard 
shoebox, open only at one end. 
The cramped quarters made it 
easier for him to think. Old Horse- 
meat called it the Cat Orgone Box 
after the famed Orgone Energy 
Accumulators of the late wildcat 
psychoanalyst Dr. Wilhelm 
Reich.

If only, Gummitch thought, he 
could devise some way of objecti- 
fying the intimations of beauty 
that flitted through his darkly 
clouded mind! Now, on the eve- 
ning of the sunny day when he 
had backed away from his water 
bowl, he attacked the problem 
anew. He knew he had been fleet- 
ingly on the verge of a great idea, 
an idea involving water, light and 
movement. An idea he had unfor- 
tunately forgotten. He closed his 
eyes and twitched his nose. I must 
concentrate, he thought to him- 
self, concentrate. 

I^EXT day Kitty-Come-Here 

' remembered her idea about 
Gummitch’s water. She boiled two 
cupfuls in a spotless enamelware 
saucepan, letting it cool for half 
an hour before using it to replace 
the seemingly offensive water in 
the young cat’s bowl. It was only 
then she noticed that the bowl 
had been upset. 

She casually assumed that big- 
footed Old Horsemeat must have 
been responsible for the accident, 
or possibly one of the two chil- 
dren — darting Sissy or blundering 
Baby. She wiped the bowl and 
filled it with the water she had 
dechlorinated. 

“Come here, Kitty, come here,” 
she called to Gummitch, who had 
been watching her actions atten- 
tively from the dining room door. 
The young cat stayed where he 



was. “Oh, well, if you want to be 
coy,” she said, shrugging her ' 
shoulders. 

There was a mysterj’’ about the 
spilled water. It had apparently 
disappeared entirely, though the 
day seemed hardly dry enough for 
total evaporation. Then she saw it 
standing in a puddle by the wall 
fully ten feet away from the bowl. 
She made a quick deduction and 
frowned a bit worriedly. 

“I never realized the kitchen 
floor sloped that much,” she told 
Old Horsemeat after dinner. 
“Maybe some beams need to be 
jacked up in the basement. I’d 
hate to think of collapsing into it 
while I cooked dinner.” 

“I’m sure this house finished all 
its settling thirty years ago,” her 
husband assured her hurriedly. 
“That slope’s always been there.” 
“Well, if you say so,” Kitty- 
Come-Here allowed doubtfully. 

Next day she found Gum- 
mitch’s bowl upset again and the 
remains of the boiled water in a 
puddle across the room. As she 
mopped it up, she began to do 
some thinking without benefit of 
Concentration Box. 

f I ■'HAT evening, after Old Horse- 
meat and Sissy had vehe- 
mently denied kicking into the 
water bowl or stepping on its 
edge, she voiced her conclusions. 
“I think Gummitch upsets it,” 
she said. “He’s rejecting it. It still

doesn’t taste right to him and he 
wants to show us.” 

“Maybe he only likes it after 
it’s run across the floor and got 
seasoned with household dust and 
the corpses of germs,” suggested 
Old Horsemeat, who believed 
most cats were bohemian types. 

“I’ll have you know I scrub 
that linoleum,” Kitty-Come-Here 
asserted. 

“Well, with detergent and 
scouring powder, then,” Old 
Horsemeat amended resourceful- 
ly- 

Kitty-Come-Here made a scorn- 
ful noise. “I still want to know 
where he gets his liquids,” she 
said. “He’s been off milk for 
weeks, you know, and he only 
drinks a little broth when I give 
him that. Yet he doesn’t seem 
dehydrated. It’s a real mystery 
and — ” 

“Maybe he’s built a still in the 
attic,” Old Horsemeat interjected. 

“ — and I’m going to find the 
answers,” Kitty-Come-Here con- 
cluded, ignoring the facetious in- 
terruption. “I’m going to find out 
where he gets the water he does 
drink and why he rejects the 
water I give him. This time I’m 
going to boil it and put in a pinch 
of salt. Just a pinch.” 

“Y ou make animals sound more 
delicate about food and drink 
than humans,” Old Horsemeat 
observed. 

“They probably are,” his wife 



countered. “For one thing they 
don’t smoke, or drink Martinis. 
It’s my firm belief that animals — 
cats, anyway — like good food just 
as much as we do. And the same 
sort of good food. They don’t en- 
joy canned catfood any more than 
we would, though they can eat it. 
Just as we could if we had to. I 
really don’t think Gummitch 
would have such a passion for raw 
horsemeat except you started him 
on it so early.” 

“He probably thinks of it as 
steak tartare,” Old Horsemeat 
said. 

Next day Kitty-Come-Here 
found her salted offering upset 
just as the two previous bowls 
had been. 

S UCH were the beginnings of 
the Great Spilled Water Mys- 
tery that preoccupied the human 
members of the Gummitch house- 
hold for weeks. Not every day, 
but frequently, and sometimes 
two and three times a day, Gum- 
mitch’s little bowl was upset. No 
one ever saw the young cat do it. 
But it was generally accepted that 
he was responsible, though for a 
time Old Horsemeat had theories 
that he did not voice involving 
Sissy and Baby. 

Kitty-Come-Here bought Gum- 
mitch a firm-footed rubber bowl 
for his water, though she hesitated 
over the purchase for some time, 
certain he would be able to taste 



70 



GALAXY 



the rubber. This bowl was found 
upset just like his regular china 
one and like the tin one she briefly 
revived from his kitten days. 

All sorts of clues and possibly 
related circumstances were seized 
upon and dissected. For instance, 
after about a month of the mys- 
terious spillings, Kitty-Come-Here 
announced, “I’ve been thinking 
back and as far as I can remember 
it never happens except on sunny 
days.” 

“Oh, Good Lord!” Old Horse- 
meat reacted. 

Meanwhile Kitty-Come-Here 
continued to try to concoct a kind 
of water that would be palatable 
to Gummitch. As she continued 
without success, her formulas be- 
came more fantastic. She quit 
boiling it for the most part but 
added a pinch of sugar, a spoonful 
of beer, a few flakes of oregano, a 
green leaf, a violet, a drop of va- 
nilla extract, a drop of iodine. 

“No wonder he rejects the stuff,” 
Old Horsemeat was tempted to 
say, but didn’t. 

Finally Kitty-Come-Here, in- 
spired by the sight of a greenly 
glittering rack of it at the super- 
market, purchased a half gallon 
of bottled water from a famous 
spring. She wondered why she 
hadn’t thought of this step earlier 
— it certainly ought to take care 
of her haunting convictions about 
the unpalatableness of chlorine 
or fluorides. (She herself could 



distinctly taste the fluorides in the 
tap water, though she never men- 
tioned this to Old Horsemeat.) 

One other development during 
the Great Spilled Water Mystery 
was that Gummitch gradually 
emerged from depression and be- 
came quite gay. He took to danc- 
ing cat schottisches and gigues 
impromptu in the living room of 
an evening and so forgot his dig- 
nity as to battle joyously with the 
vacuum-cleaner dragon when Old 
Horsemeat used one of the smaller 
attachments to curry him; the 
young cat clutched the hairy 
round brush to his stomach and 
madly clawed it as it whuitled 
menacingly. Even the afternoon 
he came home with a shoulder 
gashed by the Mad Eunuch he 
seemed strangely light-hearted 
and debonair. 

'’THE Mystery was abruptly 
solved one sunny Sunday 
afternoon. Going into the bath- 
room in. her stocking feet, 
Kitty-Come-Here saw Gummitch 
apparently trying to drown him- 
self in the toilet. His hindquarters 
were on the seat but the rest of 
his body went down into the 
bowl. Coming closer, she saw that 
his forelegs were braced against 
the opposite side of the bowl, just 
above the water surface, while his 
head thrust down sharply between 
his shoulders. She could distinctly 
hear rhythmic lapping. 



KREATIVITY FOR KATS 



71 



To tell the truth, Kitty-Come- 
Here was rather shocked. She had 
certain rather fixed ideas about 
the delicacy of cats. It speaks well 
for her progressive grounding that 
she did not shout at Gummitch 
but softly summoned her husband. 

By the time Old Horsemeat 
arrived the young cat had re- 
freshed himself and was coming 
out of his “well” with a sudden 
backward undulation. He p>assed 
them in the doorway with a single 
mew and upward look and then 
made off for the kitchen. 

The blue and white room was 
bright with sunlight. Outside the 
sky was blue and the leaves were 
rustling in a stiff breeze. Gum- 
mitch looked back once, as if to 
make sure his human congeners 
had followed, mewed again, and 
then advanced briskly toward his 
little bowl with the air of one who 
proposes to reveal all mysteries 
at once. 

Kitty-Come-Here had almost 
outdone herself. She had for the 
first time poured him the bottled 
water, and she had floated a few 
rose petals on the surface. 

Gummitch regarded them care- 
fully, sniffed at them, and then 
proceeded to fish them out one by 
one and shake them off his paw. 
Old Horsemeat repressed the urge 
to say, “I told you so.” 

When the water surface was 
completely free and winking in 
the sunlight, Gummitch curved 



one paw under the side of the 
bowl and jerked. 

Half the water spilled out, gath- 
ered itself, and then began to flow 
across the floor in little rushes, a 
silver ribbon sparkling with sun- 
light that divided and subdivided 
and reunited as it followed the 
slope. Gummitch crouched to one 
side, watching it intensely, follow- 
ing its progress inch by inch and 
foot by foot, almost pouncing on 
the little temporary pools that 
fotmed, but not quite touching 
them. Twice he mewed faintly in 
excitement. 

44T1£’S playing with it,” Old 
Horsemeat said incredu- 
lously. 

“No,” Kitty-Come-Here coun- 
tered wide-eyed, “he’s creating 
something. Silver mice. Water- 
snakes. Twinkling vines.” 

“Good Lord, you’re right,” Old 
Horsemeat agreed. “It’s a new art 
form. Would you call it water 
painting? Or water sculpture? 
Somehow I think that’s best. As 
if a sculptor made mobiles out of 
molten tin.” 

“It’s gone so quickly, though,” 
Kitty-Come-Here objected, a 
little sadly. “Art ought to last. 
Look, it’s almost all flowed over 
to the wall now.” 

“Some of the best art forms are 
completely fugitive,” Old Horse- 
meat argued. “What about impro- 
visation in music and dancing? 



72 



GALAXY 




What about jam sessions and 
shadow figures on the wall? Gum- 
mitch can always do it again — in 
fact, he must have been doing it 
again and again this last month. 
It’s never exactly the same, like 
waves or fires. But it’s beautiful.” 
“I suppose so,” Kitty-Come- 
Here said. Then coming to her- 
self, she continued, “But I don’t 
think it can be healthy for him 
to go on drinking water out of 
the toilet. Really.” 

Old Horsemeat shrugged. He 
had an insight about the artistic 
temperament and the need to dig 
for inspiration into the smelly 
fundamentals of life, but it was 
difficult to express delicately. 

Kitty-Come-Here sighed, as if 
bidding farewell to all her efforts 
with rose petals and crystalline 



bottled purity and vanilla extract 
and the soda water which had 
amazed Gummitch by faintly spit- 
ting and purring at him. 

“Oh, well,” she said, “I can scrub 
it out more often, I suppose.” 

Meanwhile, Gummitch had 
gone back to his bowl and, using 
both paws, overset it completely. 
Now, nose a-twitch, he once more 
pursued the silver streams alive 
with suns, refreshing his spirit 
with the sight of them. He was 
fretted by no problems about 
what he was doing. He had solved 
them all with one of his character- 
istically sharp distinctions: there 
was the sacred water, the spar- 
klingly clear water to create with, 
and there was the water with 
character, the water to drink.

THE PUZZLE CALLED 
GEGENSCHEIN 

P ICK a really clear night, 
but not in June or July, 
or in December or Janu- 
ary. If there is a moon in the 
sky it should be a sickle only; 
if the moon is full or nearly full 
you can give up before you 
started. Now if you have a clear 
night in one of the eight months 
where it can be done — and 
where there is no full moon — 
try to figure out where the sun 



74 



GALAXY 



is at the moment. Then look at 
the spot in the sky precisely op- 
posite to the position of the sun. 

If, in addition to ever 3 rthing 
else, your night vision is good 
you’ll see a patch of light, very 
faint light. 

I have never succeeded myself 
(I keep trying, though) but the 
books say that this patch of 
light is roughly elliptical in 
shape, does not have a clear out- 
line and that its largest diameter 
is three to four times the dia- 
meter of the moon. That i^ the 
Gegenschein. The name is Ger- 
man. Its English equivalent 
would be “counterglow” and up 
until a few days ago I thought 
that the “counter” part of the 
name refers to the fact that it 
is opposite the sun. Now, having 
waded through old accounts, it 
seems equally probable to me 
that the Gegenschein has its 
name because it is opposite to 
the zodiacal light. 

As has been hinted by the list 
of provisions in the first para- 
graph the Gegenschein is so weak 
that it is drowned out by the 
light of the full moon. The rea- 
son why two months in winter 
and two months in summer are 
ruled out is that during those 
months the Milky Way covers 
the area of the Gegenschein. 
Even the Milky Way is more 
luminous than this patch of 
light. 



The Gegenschein was discov- 
ered by — but here we run into 
the first complication. The Geg- 
enschein seems to have about as 
many discoverers as the atmos- 
phere of Venus which was first 
noticed either by the American 
Rittenhouse or else by the 
Russian Lomonossov — with the 
fair probability that a note may 
turn up somewhere crediting 
somebody more than a century 
earlier. 

tjTISTORIANS of astronomy 
are in fair agreement that 
the first discover of the 
Gegenschein was the German as- 
tronomer Theodor Brorsen. Bror- 
sen, born in 1819 in the town- 
ship of Norburg on the island 
of Alsen made his discovery in 
1853 and published it the fol- 
lowing year in a scientific 
journal under the title Ueber 
eine neue Erscheinung am Zo- 
diakallicht (“On a new phenom- 
enon of the zodiacal light”). But 
Brorsen himself stated that he 
was not the first to see it, and 
credits an observer with the 
name of Pezenas as having been 
the first to have seen it in 1730. 
What strikes me as strange is 
that it was not seen earlier. 

When Giovanni Domenico 
Cassini was director of the Paris 
Observatory — from 1671 until 
near the end of his life in 1712 
— he once spoke to his assistant

75 




Niccolo Fatio about the zodiacal 
light and suggested that Fatio 
observe it as often as possible, 
which, in the temperate zone, is 
not very often. Fatio devoted 
several years to watching for the 
zodiacal light and wrote a treat- 
ise about his observations in 
1886. It seems somewhat incred- 
ible that he should not have 
come across the Gegenschein but 
apparently he didn’t; Brorsen 
was careful to check astronomi- 
cal literature for forerunners of 
his own discovery. 

Presumably because the Geg- 
enschein is so hard to see nobody 
followed up on Brorsen’s first 
report. 

But twenty-two years later the 
Ge^enschein was discovered 
again, this time by an English- 
man, T. W. Backhouse. He 
lectured to the Royal Society 
about it. The paper was pub- 
lished in the Monthly Notices in 
1876 under the title On the 
aspect of ihe zodiacal li^ht op- 
posite the Sun. 

The third (or fourth, if you 
count Mr. Pezenas) discoverer 
of the Gegenschein was an Amer- 
ican, Edward Emerson Barnard, 
whose eyesight seems to have 
had built-in amplifiers. He saw it 
one night in 1882 and thought 
that it was a very high thin 
cloud illuminated by starlight. 
But during the following night 
the “cloud” was still in the same 



place. Barnard who had not 
been brought up as an astrono- 
mer (he was originally a photo- 
grapher) did not know about 
Brorsen’s and Backhouse’s ear- 
lier papers at the time. But he 
immediately concluded that this 
was an astronomical phenome- 
non. 

Now if we agree on the 
definition that everything more 
than 200 miles from sea level is 
an astronomical phenomenon 
Barnard’s conclusion is unassail- 
able. Unfortunately this does not 
tell us what it is. 

^T^HE oldest explanation ties 
the Gegenschein to the zo- 
diacal light, which appears as a 
slanting cone of light that can 
be seen (especially in the trop>- 
ics) after sunset. If you watch in 
the morning before sunrise the 
same cone of light often precedes 
the rising of the sun. In fact, in 
the Near East, where some re- 
ligious practices depend on the 
moment of sunrise, the zodiacal 
light had been noted down under 
names meaning “false dawn” as 
having no religious significance. 
(According to Alexander von 
Humboldt, in his Kosmos, vol. I., 
page 145 of the original edition, 
the inhabitants of Mexico knew 
the zodiacal light prior to 1500.) 

Because of this shape its first 
systematic observer, Niccolo 
Fatio, concluded that the zodia- 



76 



GALAXY 



cal light was actually an accumu- 
lation of dust particles in space, 
generally lens-shaped, its central 
plane more or less coinciding 
with the ecliptic, and illuminated 
by the sun. Fatio, and many 
others, thought that the diameter 
of this dust lens was less than 
the diameter of the earth’s orbit. 

Now, some astronomers said 
after the discovery of the Gegen- 
schein, all we have to do is to 
assume that the dust lens, in an 
attenuated form, extends beyond 
the earth’s orbit. Each dust par- 
ticle would naturally behave like 
a tiny moon. Those' particles 
closer to the sun than we are 
would turn their dark backsides 
to us and we could not see them. 
Those at the same distance from 
the sun as the earth would show 
a half-moon phase, but since 
there are not many of them we 
don’t notice them. But those 
farther away would have “full 
phase”, comparable to the full 
moon when it is farther from the 
sun than the earth. Those we see, 
as a very dim patch of light. 

That the Gegenschein is al- 
ways opposite to the sun is, there- 
fore, easily explained. The laws 
of optics demand it; we see only 
those which, to us, are fully il- 
luminated. And they are opposite 
the position of the sun. 

Barnard himself improved on 
this idea by pointing out that the 
earth’s atmosphere should act as 



a lens and concentrate sunlight 
in that direction. 

The reason why anybody 
bothered to think of additional 
explanations was that, as time 
went on, astronomers had less 
and less use for that much dust 
in space and found more and 
more reasons to doubt its exist- 
ence. 

OUT a little dust was permis- 
sible, hence the Gegenschein 
might be an isolated dust cloud. 

It could be mathematically 
proved that a body located on 
the line connecting the center 
of the sun and the center of the 
earth would be dragged along 
by the earth, if it was located 
either somewhat closer to the 
sun or somewhat farther from 
the sun. There were just two con- 
ditions, in addition to the location 
on that line. One was a certain 
distance, 900,000 miles from the 
earth, if the body was farther 
away from the sun. The Gegen- 
schein could be at just that dis- 
tance. At any event one trian- 
gulation placed it a million miles 
from earth. The other condition 
was that the body to be dragged 
along had to have a very small 
mass as compared to the mass 
of the earth. Well, obviously a 
dust cloud would be virtually 
massless as compared to earth. 
(See Figure.) 

In between, some other re-

searchers, for example Svante 
Arrhenius, pointed out that they 
had reasons to believe that our 
earth had a very tenuous tail, 
like a comet. And like a comet’s 
tail it would point away from 
the sun. The Gegenschein was 
simply this tail, as it appeared 
to people looking from its origin 
along its length. 

Still later — beginning in about 
1937 — Dr. Edward O. Hulburt, 
then one of the research directors 
at the Naval Research Labora- 
tory, evolved another theory 
which has some similarity to the 
comet tail postulated by Arrhen- 
ius. It goes under the name of 
“atmospheric ion theory.” It as- 
sumes a hairpin-shaped ‘Veil” of 



ions around the earth, with the 
two “legs” of the hairpin pointing 
away from the sun. The light of 
the Gegenschein, according to 
this theory, is the end on view 
of the “legs” of the veil, much as 
thought by Arrhenius. The zodi- 
acal light would be caused by the 
ions of the hairpin’s bend, re- 
emitting solar energy as visible 
light. 

In about 1949 the Russians 
began to feel that some modern 
work should be done on both 
zodiacal light and Gegenschein, 
and at the Gorna Astrophysical 
Observatory at Alma Ata they 
tried to take spectrograms of 
both. They succeeded in taking 
spectrograms, but these turned 



78 



GALAXY 



out to be just somewhat more 
powerful versions of the lines 
that the night sky would produce 
anywhere. 

The puzzle of the Gegenschein 
is still unsolved. 

Could we do something with a 
space probe? 

Well, if the old dust cloud 
theory is correct the answer is 
yes. But trying to shoot a rocket 
into the Gegenschein would be 
tricky indeed. Shooting “straight 
out” is an impossibility. What 
could be tried is to shoot past 
the moon when the moon is in 
about the position shown on the 
diagram. Then, if the rocket 
passes close enough (it might also 
have to be slowed down) the 
moon would deflect its path to 
the extent that the so-called 
“escape leg,” after passing the 
moon, will point in the direction 
of the Gegenschein. Some addi- 
tional guidance would certainly 
be needed. In fact, the whole shot 
looks too difficult for the im- 
mediate future. 

But if we do get a space probe 
to go through the Gegenschein 
we would know what it is. 

In the meantime I’ll keep try- 
ing at least to see it. 

The Annexation of Patagonia 

¥TAVING been told by my 
readers that they like my 
column to be as far-ranging as 



possible, the virtually forgotten 
story of the “annexation” of Pata- 
gonia by the German Empire 
might prove to be amusing, espe- 
cially since it has a scientific 
aspect. 

The year was 1886, at the 
time when all the European 
powers grabbed colonies where- 
ever they could. And the un- 
witting “hero” was Dr. Ludwig 
Brackebusch, professor of miner- 
alogy at a university in Argen- 
tina, a native of Northeim in 
Germany and recipient of a 
Ph.D. from the nearby Univer- 
sity of Gottingen. 

The news first “broke” in a 
small newspaper which served 
both Northeim and Gottingen, 
the two townships interested in 
Dr. Brackebusch as a native son. 
The paper reported that Prof. 
Brackebusch — in a manner which 
was left completely unexplained 
— had annexed all the land to the 
south of 48° southern latitude 
and for some distance to the west 
of 54° western longitude, gen- 
erally known as Patagonia. The 
article went on to say that the 
erection of a meteorological sta- 
tion at Cape Horn was being 
planned and that the newly an- 
nexed area should have some 
profitable aspects. To begin with, 
tobacco growing had just been 
undertaken there and was found 
to be very promising. And the 
land was thickly dotted with 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 



copses of a tree popularly known 
as the vinegar pear (scientific 
name: Pirus communis var. ace- 
tosa). While the fruit of this tree 
was unlikely to find a wide mar- 
ket, the wood would be welcome 
since it was' just like mahogany. 

That news of such far-reach- 
ing importance as the acquisition 
o’f a whole new colony should 
originate in an obscure provin- 
cial paper was explained by the 
bigger newspapers as presumably 
due to the fact that Prof. Bracke- 
busch had first told this fact to 
members of his family. At any 
event a dozen other German 
newspapers reprinted the story, 
papers which were progressively 
more important. 

Naturally the “news” was 
taken over by other newspapers, 
especially in England. A notice 
even made the Times in London. 
As for Prof. Brackebusch he was 
peacefully teaching mineralogy 
all along. Until, one day, he re- 
ceived a letter from the govern- 
ment of Argentina, firmly re- 
questing his presence in Buenos 
Aires on a certain day and at a 
certain time. In Buenos Aires 
they considered Patagonia a part 
of Argentina and nobody was 
ready for a compromise of any 
sort. 

Well, Brackebusch could prove 
that he had not been absent 
from the campus for long enough 
even to take a trip to Patagonia 



and the session ended with both 
head and handshaking. Fortu- 
nately it soon turned out that a 
group of graduates in Gottingen, 
after imbibing a sufficient quan- 
tity of beer, had written the ori- 
ginal notice in the little paper. 
The storm blew over. Bracke- 
busch, about a year later, called 
on them during a leave of ab- 
sence, armed with specially 
printed calling cards reading 

Prof. Dr. Ludwig Brackebusch 
Protector of Patagonia 

and in general nobody was 
harmed or mad for very long. 

Oh, the scientific aspect of the 
story? Nobody — but nobody — 
had checked the coordinates on 
a piap. The ocean there is prob- 
ably two miles deep. 

Mathematical Note on 
Seven-League Boots 

TT was probably inevitable that 
somebody who recently saw 
me off at an airport, looking at 
the Boeing 707 jet waiting for 
me, remarked “Now you step into 
your seven-league boot and you’ll 
be in New York in about five 
hours.” This sounded like a nice 
literary remark at the time, but 
later, during the flight, I started 
to think in figures. 

Part of it was due to the fact 
that I remembered a science 



80 



GALAXY 



r 

I fiction (or fantasy) story I had 

I read more than 30 years ago. 

I The story — it was of short novel 
length, and I seem to remember 
that it was of French origin al- 
though I wouldn’t swear to it — 
began with the incident that a 
corpse is found on a country 
road. It is a corpse of a fairly 
young man, mangled and bruised 
and cut beyond description. 
Every bone in his body is broken 
and there is just enough left of 
his face to make a drawing for 
a public poster asking, “Has any- 
body seen this man recently?” 
The only thing which is not dam- 
aged are the high walking boots 
the man is wearing; they are new, 
Russian style, well made and in 
perfect condition. 

A week or two later the wife 
of a dairy farmer reports to the 
police. Yes, she had seen the 
man, on the same day he was 
found dead. He had come asking 
for something to eat. She had 
given him something to eat and, 
seeing that his shoes were in an 
impossible condition, had given 
him the boots which had been 
around the hoUse. When she 
turned around the man was gone, 
without even having said thank 
you. And the boots, the police- 
man wanted to know, did they 
belong to your husband? No, 
said the woman, we took them 
off a man my husband and the 
gendarme found dead in the for- 



est a few years ago after the 
spring thaw. He could not be 
identified and he was in rags. 
But his boots were too new and 
too good to be buried with him. 

The story is, of course, that 
the narrator then traced the 
indestructible boots backward 
until he had seven cases of dead 
bodies, all wearing new Russian 
style walking boots. And each 
corpse was found seven leagues 
from the place where the man 
had been given a new pair of 
boots by somebody who felt 
sorry for him. 

Well, my modern seven-league 
boot, the 707 jet, was making 
about ten miles a minute at the 
time, flying high up in thin air 
to reduce aerodynamic drag. This 
was fast all right, but not yet as 
fast as the seven-league boots. 
At normal walking pace you 
make about three steps in two 
seconds. In sixty seconds you 
make, therefore, 90 steps. Wear- 
ing the seven-league boots you 
would cover 90 times 7 leagues. 
Since the league is usually de- 
fined as three statute miles, this 
means you would walk 630 miles 
per minute or 37,800 miles per 
hour. 

Regretfully I had to conclude 
that the author of that partly re- 
membered story (which was 
such a nice idea) had made a 
mistake. His conclusion was that 
the seven-league boots had been

created by an evil magician to 
claim victim after victim. They 
would have done no such thing. 
The very first man to wear them, 
with his very first step, would 
not only have gone into orbit 
but would have acquired more 
than escape velocity and would 
have disappeared from this earth 
forever. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

7f I stood on another planet 
would the sky look different? 
Could I, lor example, see the 
Southern Cross? 

Dorothy Steinfeld 
Elizabeth, N. J. 

My first impulse, when I re- 
ceived this question, was to write 
at the bottom of the letter, “Yes, 
provided you look in the right 
direction,” but then it occurred 
to me that this is a far more 
interesting point than it appears 
to be at the surface. 

The general answer is, of 
course, that, as far as the so- 
called fixed stars are concerned, 
it does not make any difference 
whether you look up from the 
nightside of Mercury or from the 
surface of Neptune’s larger moon, 
2,760 million miles from Mer- 
cury. The major constellations 
will look alike from » any planet 
in our solar system. It is true 
that the distance just mentioned 



would cause a minor shift for a 
few nearby stars, but that would 
not be enough to be perceptible 
to the naked eye. But otherwise 
the sky would look different from 
different planets. 

Let’s quickly run through the 
list. From the brightside of Mer- 
cury you wouldn’t see anything. 
An eye adjusted to the sun glare 
of the brightside would not be 
capable of registering star im- 
ages. From the nightside of Mer- 
cury you would see two really 
brilliant “stars” (Venus and 
Earth) but aside from them the 
picture of the sky would be the 
same as from Earth. From Venus, 
if you could look through its 
atmosphere. Earth would be the 
most brilliant star and Mercury 
would look much brighter than 
it does from Earth. 

The sky as seen from Mars 
would be fairly different. To be- 
gin with you would have two 
evening (or morning) stars, 
Venus and Earth, with the Earth 
much the brighter of the two. 
Then you would have another 
very bright star, nearly motion- 
less, namely the outer moon of 
Mars, Deimos. The inner moon, 
Phobos, would provide most of 
the entertainment. It would rise 
in the West and climb to its 
zenith in 2 hours and 9 minutes, 
increasing visibly in size and 
also changing its phases in the 
process. When at its zenith, twice 



82 



GALAXY 



r 

I out of three times, it would wink 
out, eclipsed by the planet’s 
shadow. 

The view from one of the 
moons of Jupiter would again be 
much different. Of course, the 
masive planet would be the 
dominant object in the sky. If 
you were on one of the smaller 
moons of Jupiter the four large 
moons would be interesting 
sights, too. The Sun would have 
only about l/5th the apparent 
diameter as compared with the 
view from Earth, still showing a 
small disk of incredible brilliance. 
The other small moons of Jupiter 
would not be visible to the naked 
eye. Of the inner planets, Venus 
and Earth should be visible quite 
close to the sun. It is very likely 
that the two clusters of the “Tro- 
jans” — the small groups of aster- 
oids in Jupiter’s orbit, 60 degrees 
ahead of and behind the planet 
— could be seen. Since the eye 
very likely would not be able to 
tell the several bodies apart they 
might look somewhat diffuse. 
And at times the brightest planet 
in the sky would be Saturn, natu- 
rally. 

The sky as seen from one of 
Saturn’s moons is again some- 
thing different. Again the planet 
would be the dominant object in 
the sky. Since all of Saturn’s 
moons are fairly large, the other 
eight should be visible from any 
of the nine. The sim would be 



down to one-tenth of the size to 
which we are used but still would 
shed a large amount of light. 
Jupiter would be the most bril- 
liant planet in the sky. The inner 
planets would no longer be 
naked-eye objects. Of course if 
Saturn and Uranus are in the 
same sector of their respective 
orbits, Uranus would also be a 
very bright planet. Naturally 
Neptune, if in the proper sector 
of its orbit, would be a naked- 
eye object. 

From one of the moons of 
Uranus the sky would be mostly 
the sky of the fixed stars, Of 
course the other moons of Uranus 
would be clearly visible. Of the 
planets, Jupiter, Saturn and Nep- 
tune would be naked-eye objects. 
But Neptune would put in an 
appearance only several centu- 
ries apart, Jupiter would appear 
to be close to the sun (and the sun 
would just be a brilliant star) so 
that the planet that could be 
seen much of the time would be 
Saturn — with disappearances 
amounting to about a dozen 
Earth years. And from Neptune’s 
larger moon you would see the 
fixed stars, a brilliant star (the 
sun), the smaller moon of Nep- 
tune on frequent occasions and 
for long periods not a single one 
of the other planets. 

But from each planet — espe- 
cially if you had a pair of bin- 
oculars to help you — the ap-

pearance of the constellations 
would be typical enough so that 
one hour of observation would 
tell you where you are. 

Why is a division by zero un- 
defined? If you answer that it is 
undefined by definition (para- 
dox? ) why doesn’t somebody de- 
fine it? 

Charles T. Warren 
West Chester, Penna. 

This is a question which re- 
quires two answers, and I don’t 
think that two answers to one 
question is too paradoxical. The 
first answer is that mathemati- 
cians, like lawyers and judges, do 
not always use the Queen’s Eng- 
lish the way other people do. 
Mathematicians will say, without 
batting an eyelash, that the “triv- 
ial divisors” are naturally ruled 
out and that they expect a 
“unique” solution to this problem. 
But a “trivial divisor” just means 
either the figure itself or else 
“one,” while a unique solution is 
not an unusual one but merely 
means that there is only one 
solution. 

Now for the “undefined” divi- 
sion. 

You realize easily that multiply- 
ing a figure by zero will always 



result in zero — ^because the re- V 
quest to multiply 5, or 57 or 457 
by zero is a request not to multi- ' 
ply it at all, not even once. Now 
if you tried to divide by zero you 
would have the following: The 
figure M is to be divided by N, 
with X as the result. Logically, 
then, N times X must equal M. 
Now let us assume that N = 0 
so that you divide M by zero 
and start looking for the value 
of X, assuming, naturally, that M 
is a figure other than zero. 

The equation N times X = M 
now has turned into zero times 
X = M. But zero times X is zero, 
hence M would have to be zero 
too which makes the whole opera- 
tion nonsense because this pro- 
duces X = 0/0. 

Going over the procedure once 
more slowly, you’ll realize that 
you either find that X just doesn’t 
have any logical value, or else 
you find that zero times X equals 
zero — ^which we knew all along. 
Hence, some mathematicians call 
this operation “undefined,” with 
the meaning that it doesn’t yield 
a result. Other mathematicians 
feel more strongly about it and 
have added a commandment say- 
ing, “Thou shalt not divide by 
zero.”

A FRIED egg came floating 
up through the stone 
steps of the Medical 
Center and broke on my shoe. 
According to my watch, it was 
time for the breakfast I didn’t 
have that morning, so I waited 
a moment for the usual two 
rashers of bacon. 

When they materialized, I 
hopped aside to avoid them and 
went back into the building, 
where the elevator took me 
straight up to the psychiatric 
floor, without asking. 

“Your blood pressure, salts, 
minerals, vitamins, basal metab- 
olism, brain pattern, nervous re- 
flexes and skin temperature 
control are within accepted 
tolerances,” it droned, opening 
the doors to let me off. “You 
have no clinical organic dis- 
orders; you weigh a hundred and 
fifty-two pounds. Earth, measure 
six feet one inch, and have a 
clear pallid complexion and an 
egg on your shoe.” 

I walked down the corridor to 
Dr. Doogle Spacio-Psycho Please 



Enter and went determinedly in. 

“Name, please,” said the blonde 
receptionist, tapping her nail 
eroder. 

“Jones. Harry Jones.” 

“Mr. Harry K. Jones, the 
physicist?” 

“Yes.” 

“Oh, no,” she said, fiddling with 
the appointment list, “Mr. Harry 
K. Jones has just had his morn- 
ing appointment and left.” 

“I know,” I said. “An important 
piece of clinical data has just 
turned up. I have returned with 
an egg on my shoe.” 

“I think you’d better see the 
doctor.” 

I sat down to wait and took 
the little bottle of pills from my 
pocket. “From the Galaxy to you, 
through Dr. Doogle, Spacio- 
Psycho,” it said on the label.

inner office door opened 
and Dr. Doogle smiled fatly 
at me from behind his expensive 
desk. 

“Do come in,” he called, “and 
tell me all about it.” 

“It’s happened again,” I said, 
going into his office. 

“Well, why not, if you feel that 
way? Nurse, bring me Mr. 
Hing-humph’s case history.” 

“Mr. Har-ry K. Jo-nes’ film 
is in the transcriber. Doctor,” 
said the receptionist. “Mr. Jones, 
the physicist.” 

“Ah, yes, of course. Please sit 
down, Mr. Jones. Now what ex- 
actly is the trouble? Hold nothing 
back, tell me all, reveal your 
intimate thoughts.” 

“The main entrance just 
served me the breakfast that your 
diet forbids,” I said, sitting down. 

“Plain case of wish fulfillment. 
Put it down to poltergeists, Mr. 
Jones.” 

“And what exactly do you 
mean by that?” 

“Well, now,” Dr. Doogle said, 
drumming his fat fingers, “I don’t 
think we need to go into techni- 
calities, Mr. Jones.” 

“Look,” I said firmly. “I came 
to you to get a quiet night’s 
sleep. No more insomnia, you 
said, leave your problems in the 
laboratory, let not the nuclei! 



banish sleep, work hard, sleep 
hard, take tranquilizers and en- 
joy the useful recuperation of the 
daily wear on body tissues, deep 
dreamless sleep of the innocent.” 
He look at me suspiciously. 
“It sounds like the sort of 
advice I might have given,” he 
admitted. 

“Well, at least I managed to 
keep my dreams in my head until 
I started your treatment. I have 
an urgent problem to solve that 
vitally affects national security. 
I can’t have this sort of thing 
happening in the middle of an 
experiment.” 

I pointed to the fried egg on 
my shoe and shook it off on the 
pile of his green carpet. 

“Yes. Well,” he said, peering 
over the desk at it. “If you feel 
that strongly, Mr. Jones, perhaps 
you’d better give up the diet and 
just take the pills.” 

“I want to know how it hap- 
pens,” I said, and I settled firmly 
into the consulting chair. 

Dr. Doogle coughed profes- 
sionally. “Of course, of course. 
You are an intelligent man, Mr. 
Jones. One of our leading physi- 
cal scientists. Naturally you wish 
to know the precise mechanism 
of such phenomena. Very com- 
mendable and entirely natural. 
Think no more about it.” 

“Dr. Doogle, do you know 
what you are doing?” 

“Spacio-Psycho is still in its

early stages, Mr. Jones. You are 
really privileged to be a pioneer, 
you know. We have had some 
most interesting results with that 
new tranquilizer. I hope you’re 
not losing faith, Mr. Jones?” 

“I accept the orthodox phil- 
osophy of Spacio-Psycho, it is 
only the basic philosophy of 
Ch’anna or Zen, and I had the 
routine scientific education, 
naturally.” 

“Ah,” said Dr. Doogle with 
rapture, “the substratum of the 
imiverse is no-mind, and thus all 
material things are in constant 
unimpeded mutual solution. Ji-ji- 
muge, the appleness of an apple 
is indistinguishable from the cup- 
ness of a cup.” 

“And an egg on the shoe is 
the breakfast I didn’t have,” I 
said. 

“Here,” he said. “I think those 
pills are sending your sleeping 
mind down beyond the purely 
jjersonal level of your own emo- 
tions and subconscious cerebra- 
tions. Take these, in a little water, 
half an hour before going to 
bed.” 

I stood up and walked over to 
the door. 

“What are they?” I asked. 

“Same as before, only stronger. 
Should send you right down to 
the vK)t of things. Pass quiet 
nights in no-mind, Mr. Jones, 
sleep beyond the trammels of 
self, support yourself on the uni- 



versal calm sea of no-mind.” 
“If these don’t work, there’ll 
be no-fee,” I told him. 

T TOOK three of the stronger 
pills that night, turned off the 
light and lay back in bed, wait- 
ing for sleep to come and get me. 
The antiseptic odor of the Medi- 
cal Center recalled itself, but 
nothing else happened, and I 
was still waiting to go to sleep 
when I woke up next morning. 
No dreams of a breakfast I 
couldn’t eat, no dreams at all. 
I had been smelling the memory 
of formaldehyde and just slid off 
to sleep. I could still smell it, 
for that matter, as if it were 
coming from the slightly open 
bedroom window. I looked up. 

“Hallo,” said the tall skinny 
man in a doctor’s coat on the 
window sill. 

“Hallo yourself,” I said. “Go 
away, I’m awake.” 

“Yes, you are. At least I as- 
sume you are. But I’m not.” 

I sat up and looked at him, 
and he obligingly turned his head 
to profile against the brightness 
of the window. He had a sharp, 
beaky face that was familiar. 

“Haven’t we met somewhere?” 

I asked. 

“Certainly,” he said, in a. 
slightly affected voice. 

‘Well?” 

“I don’t know your name,” he 
said, “but I have a very impor-

tant post-operative case at pres- 
ent, and you keep charging 
around the ward when you’re 
asleep. I just came over, as 
soon as I could get a few hours 
sleep myself, to ask you to stop 
doing it, if you don’t mind.” 

“I’ve done no such thing.” 
“You were doing it all last 
night, my friend.” 

“I was not,” I said. “I spent 
last night here in my own bed. 
I didn’t even dream.” 

“Ah, that probably accounts 
for it. Tell me, do you take 
drugs, tranquilizers, by any 
chance? We’ve had a lot of 
trouble with that. They seem to 
cause a bubble in the sequence 
of probabilities and things shift 
about. I’ve been taking a new 
one myself, while this case is on. 
I suspect that although I’m 
dreaming you, I think, you are 
not asleep at all. At least I 
wasn’t when you made all that 
noise in my ward last night.” 
“No, I’m awake,” I said. “Very 
much so.” 

“I see. Well, I shall wake up 
soon myself and go back to my 
own world, of course. But while 
I’m here, I suppose you haven’t 
any advanced works on post- 
operative hyperspace relapse? 

‘Tity,” he said, as I shook my 
head. 

“I suppose you have no in- 
formation on the fourth octave 
of ultra-uranium elements?” 



He shook his head. “Didn’t 
even know they existed,” he said. 
“I don’t believe they do in my 
probable time. What are you, a 
physicist? Ah,” he added, as I 
nodded, “I wanted to specialize 
in physics when I was in college, 
but I went in for medicine in- 
stead.” 

“So did I,” I said, “medicine, 
I mean, but I never passed 
pharmacology with all those 
confusing extraterrestrial deriva- 
tives.” 

“Really?” he said interestedly. 
“It’s my weakest subject, too. 
I’m a pretty good surgeon, but 
an awful fool with medications. 
I suppose that’s how we got to- 
gether. You won’t come busting 
up the ward again, will you?” 

“I’d like to be obliging, but 
if I don’t dream and I don’t 
know where I am when I’m 
asleep, I don’t see what I can 
do to stop it. It’s not as if I’m 
really there, is it?” 

H e crossed his arms and 
frowned at me. “Look,” he 
said. “In my probable time, you’re 
as much physically there as I 
am now in your time here. I’ll 
prove it. I know I’m asleep in 
the emergency surgeon’s room in 
my hospital. You know you’re 
awake in your bedroom.” 

He held out his hand and 
walked across the floor to me. 
“My name’s Jones,” he said. 



“So’s mine,” I answered, shak- 
ing his solid hand. “This must 
be a very vivid dream to you.” 
We smiled at each other, and 
as he turned away, I caught 
sight of his reflection in the wall 
mirror beside my hairbrush on 
the cabinet. 

“Good heavens!” I said. “In a 
mirror, you look exactly like me. 
Is your name Harry Jones?” 

He stopped, walked over to 
the mirror and moved about 
until he could see me in it. 

“Harold EL Jones,” he said. 
‘You’ve got the face I shave 
every morning, but I’ve only just 
recognized you. You’re me.” 

“I prefer to think you are me,” 
I said. 

“So you did fail that final 
pharmacology exam, eh? And I 
didn’t, in my probability. Well, 
well. I must admit it seemed more 
probable I would fail at the time, 
but I passed.” 

“It was that tramp Kate’s 
fault. She said yes too easily.” 

He coughed and looked at his 
fingers. “She said no to me. And, 
as a matter of fact, after I passed 
I married her. She’s my wife.” 
“Tm sorry. I meant nothing 
personal.” 

“You never married?” 

“I never really got over Kate,” 

I said. 

“I wonder what would have 
happened if I had qualified and 
then not married her.” 



“You mean what did happen 
— to the Harry K Jones who 
passed in pharmacology but did 
not marry Kate. He must be 
around in another probability 
somewhere, the same as we are. 
Good heavens,” I shouted, “some- 
where I may have solved the 
fourth octave equation.” 

“You’re right, Harry. And I 
may have found out how to get 
hyperspace relapse under con- 
trol.” 

“Harold,” I said, “This is 
momentous! It is more probable 
that you-I and I-you will make 
a mess of things, but there must 
be other probability sequences 
where we are successful.” 

“And we can get to them,” he 
shouted, jumping up. “Are you 
using oxylatohydrobenzoic-pheo- 
phenophino?” 

“Something like that.” 

“Three pills last thing at 
night?” 

“Yes.” 

“Ever have foreign bodies 
materialize into your time-space?” 
“Several breakfasts,” I said. 
“The last egg was yesterday, on 
my shoe.” 

“It was Virginia ham with me, 
so I stopped dieting and increased 
the dosage.” 

“So did I,” I said. “I suppose, 
apart from major points where 
a whole probability branches 
off, we lead much the same lives. 
But eggs don’t dream. How did

91 



the ham get into your waking 
world?” 

“Harry, really! I have a ten- 
dency to jump to conclusions, 
which you must control. How do 
you know eggs don’t dream? I 
would have thought, though, that 
a pig was peculiarly liable to 
the nightmare that it will end up 
as a rasher — . any reasonably 
observant pig, that is. But I don’t 
think that is necessary. Obvi- 
ously, we are dipping down to a 
stratum where things coexist in 
fact, and not merely one in fact 
and the other in mind, or one 
probability and not its twin 
alternative. Now, how do I get 
hold of the me that solved this 
hyperspace relapse business?” 
“And I the ultra-uranium 
octave relationship,” I added. 

“Look out,” he said. “I’m wak- 
ing up. Good-by, Harry. Look 
after myself ...” 

He flickered, paused in re- 
covery and then faded insub- 
stantially away. I looked around 
my empty bedroom. Then, be- 
cause it was time to go to work 
at the laboratory, I shaved, 
dressed and left my apartment, 
as usual. 

S OME high brass and politicians 
had been visiting the labo- 
ratory, showing off to their 
females how they were important 
enough to visit the top-secret 
bomb proving labs, and the 



thick perfume was hanging in 
the sealed rooms like a damp 
curtain. 

“I wish they wouldn’t bring 
women into the unventilated 
labs,” I grumbled to my assistant 
“Never mind. Chief. If you 
can make this bomb work, 
they’ll let you build your own 
lab in the Nevada desert, with 
no roads to it. Have you found 
the solution?” 

“I’ll tell you when I have,” I 
said. “But I do have a new 
approach to the problem.” 

And as soon as I could, I left I 
the labs and went back to my 
apartment downtown, took three! 
pills and lay still, waiting for 
sleep. I could not get the smell 
of that perfume in the lab out 
of my nose. It was a heavy 
gardenia-plus-whatnot odor. I 
woke up in the middle of the 
night with the perfume still 
clinging to the air. The room 
was dark and I crossed my 
fingers as I leaned over to turn; 
on the bedside lamp. If mental 
concentration on all the possible 
errors in my work was the key, 
the successful me should be here 
in the room, snatched from his 
own segment of probability. 

I turned on the light. There 
was no one else in the room. 

“Hell,” I said. 

Perhaps it just meant he, or 
that me, was not asleep, or was 
perversely not using tranquilizers. 



92 



GALAXY 



Or didn’t that matter? No, I 
controlled this alone and had 
gone wrong. 

“Did you say something, 
Jiany?” asked Kate, stepping 
out of the bathroom and pulling 
the top of her nightgown into, 
I guess, place. “Ooo, fancy 
dreaming about you. This is odd.” 

I sat up and covered myself 
protectively in the bedsheets. 

“Look, Kate,” I said. “I don’t 
want to see you. I’m not your 
husband, really. He’s a pleasant 
fellow, I met him today, and he’s 
not me. I never became a doctor. 
No doubt you remember what 
I was doing instead of studying.” 

That was a mistake, for she 
came and sat on the edge of the 
bed and ran her fingers into my 
hair. 

“I thought it was odd I should 
dream about my husband,” she 
said. “I’ll believe you, because I 
don’t know how I got here and 
you do look like the Harry I 
used to know, before he went all 
high scientific surgeon and no 
time for fun.” 

She curved more fully than 
she had when she was eighteen, 
but there was neat sjmimetry to 
her sine formulae, and she still 
had blonde hair. Her perfume 
was the same as the one in the 
lab I had been smelling all day, 
it was now reaching me at high 
amperage. 

So that was the key, the 



evocative power of smell associa- 
tion. I sniffed deeply at the 
perfume in appreciation. 

“Like it?” Kate asked, wrig- 
gling. 

“Only for its scientific values,” 
I said. “It suggests a most valu- 
able line of research.” 

“I’m in favor,” she said, and 
pressed me to the bed. 

“Your husband is coming!” I 
shouted, and it worked. She dis- 
appeared. Presumably she woke 
up in her own probability time- 
space. And no doubt Kate’s 
reflexes by now were trained to 
snap her awake and away at the 
suggestion that her husband was 
around. It was highly improbable 
that Kate would alter much. 

I got up to make myself some 
coffee. There was no point in 
wasting sleep without a plan. 
Clearly, I had to take the pills 
and fix the appropriate smell in 
my mind, and when I woke up 
I would drag the proper slice of 
another probability with me. 
And then I would interview the 
me who had solved the ultra- 
uranium heavy element equation. 
And the bomb to end all bombs 
would be perfected. The test 
was ready, waiting for me to say, 
“Let’s go, boys. We know what 
will happen this time.” 

But there Was, it struck me, 
the difficulty of finding the right 
scent to evoke the right probable 
me. 



SCENT MAKES A DIFFERENCE 



93 




r COLLECTED all the tooth- 
paste, deodorant, shaving stick, 
aftershave lotion I could find 
in the bathroom and started on 
the toothpaste. I inhaled deeply 
and lay down, with the first tube 
on my chest. But after the 
coffee, I slept very briefly, and 
when I looked up there was 
only a toothbrush on the carpet. 



It was not mine in this world and 
I had no idea whose it was, or 
rather which probable me it be- 
longed to. 

But at least this established 
the principle. The smell produced 
the object — and, if I went 
deep enough in sleep, it would 
produce the whole Jones. 

I dressed quickly and went out 



for a walk in the night air, 
breathing deeply and memoriz- 
ing every scent I came across. 
Then I went back to the apart- 
ment, sniffed hard at the row of 
personal unguents, and lay down 
to sleep. 

When I woke up, it was 
morning and the room was full 
of people. 



There were about a dozen of 
me, some wearing very odd 
clothes, some scowling, others 
grinning unbecomingly, and some 
looking just plain stupid. 

“Gentlemen,” I said, standing 
up on my bed, “I am sorry to 
disturb your dreams but a matter 
of vital consequence has made 
me call you all here. I am Harry, 



or Harold K Jones, and I be- 
came a physicist. I need your 
help. Do any of you know any- 
thing about the octaves of ele- 
ments beyond uranium?” 

There was a babble, through 
which I heard chiefly: 

“The man’s mad . He says 
he’s me . Who are you, any- 
way? . No, you’re not. I’m 
Jones ...” 

“Please, gentlemen,” I said. “I 
don’t expect we have much time 
before some of you wake up in 
your own probability. You, sir, 
in the armchair — yes, you in 
the tight pants — how about 
you?” 

“Me?” he said. “I’m Captain 
Jones. Third Vector Spacefleet. 
Engineer rank. Who the galactic 
hellix are you, eh?” 

Even from the bed, I could 
detect the smell of sweat and 
grease from his working uniform. 

“I suppose you took up flight 
engineering at high school?” I 
suggested. 

“Quite right,” he snapped. 

An early deviation, obviously. 
I remembered being enthralled 
with the arrival when I was a 
kid of the early space rockets, 
but my enthusiasm was daunted 
by old Birchall, who made us 
stick to airplanes. Obviously, his 
was not. 

“How about you?” I asked, 
pointing to the thinnest me in 
the room. 



“Penal colony on Arcetus,” he ; 
said. “Eternal labor.” 

“Oh, I’m sorry. I wonder which 
time — well, how many physi- 
cists are there here, or physical 
chemists, or astronomers, or even 
general scientists?” 

I walked around the room, 
detecting toothpaste brands A, B, 
C and Whitebrighter, and a range 
of toilet preparations with manly 
odors contributing to our popu- 
larity with friends, relatives, girls 
and bosses, but no other physi- 
cist. Not a trace of research in 
my line. And one or two of them 
were already showing signs of 
waking up elsewhere and disap- 
pearing from the room. 

I was about to start tracing it 
back to the point when I aban- 
doned a medical career, and I 
could still smell the formalde- 
hyde, when Dr. Harold K. 
Jones appeared. 

“Look,” he said, “I want you 
to keep away from Kate. Perhaps 
I didn’t make that clear yester- 
day . Good heavens, where 
did you get all, of these me from? 
Does anyone here know anything 
about post-operative hyperspace 
relapse?” 

rvISGUSTEDLY, I saw that 
^-^more than half of them did. 
Perhaps I should have been a 
doctor, after all. The probabilities 
were heavily represented in 
medicine. I sat on the bed and 

GALAXY 



stared at my toes while the 
doctors babbled excitedly to- 
gether. I gathered that Dr. 
Harold K. Jones had solved his 
problem, anyway. 

“Excuse me,” said a thoughtful 
me in a very quiet voice. “I 
didn't want to make myself ob- 
trusive, but I did do a certain 
amount of research on the 
theoretical possibilities of ele- 
ments heavier than uranium. It 
seemed to me they might go on 
being discovered almost indefi- 
nitely.” 

“They are,” I said quickly, 
“octave after octave of them. Tell 
me about it, please.” 

“Look,” he said, “it was only 
an idea. I really specialized in 
biochemistry, but we do use trace 
elements, and the formula I 
worked out at the time was — 
let me see ...” 

“Please try to remember,” I 
said. 

“Ah, yes, it was this,” he said, 
and the strain of remembering 
woke him up and he disappeared 
back to his own probability. 

‘This was damned well plan- 
ned, Harry!” said Dr. Harold K. 
Jones enthusiastically. “I think 
we can save hundreds of people 
every year now. I always knew 
I had it in me.” 

“Listen, Jones,” said Captain 
Jones of the Third Vector Space- 
fleet, pushing himself through 
the crowd. “I’ve been talking to 

SCENT MAKES A DIFF 



one or two of the others, see, and 
if you have the galactic gall to 
disturb my sleep again, I’m going 
to blast you. Is that clear?” 

“Perfectly,” I said. 

“It’s tricky out in space, you 
know. No hard feelings, but the 
fraction of a micro-error and 
poof! You see what I mean. I 
must get a sound sleep at stand- 
down.” 

“Don’t forget what I said about 
Kate,” Dr. Harold K. Jones 
remembered to warn me. “I know 
how to do it, too. And you can 
have an accident with my instru- 
ments — easily.” 

He disappeared. I watched as 
the others woke up and went, 
one by one, even the felon from 
Arcetus, until they were all gone 
and I was alone with dark 
thoughts on heavy elements. It 
was so improbable that I was 
the only me who had worked on 
these lines, and very probable 
that if two of us with similar 
minds did work on the same 
problem, we could between us 
find the answer. Look at Dr. 
Jones and his hyperspace re- 
lapse. 

Thinking of Dr. Jones made 
me think of Kate, and I fell 
asleep again with the memory of 
her scent in my head, as if I 
were really smelling it. When I 
woke up again, halfway through 
the morning, there she was in my 
room. She was at least dressed

this time, but she smiled famil- 
iarly at me. 

“For God’s sake, Kate,” I said, 
“go back to your husband!” 



S HE BEGAN to cry. “Oh, 
Haroldkin,” she said. “I’m so 
glad to see you. I must be dream- 
ing, because I know you’re dead, 
but I’ve kept everything just the 
way it was. Look — I haven’t 
even touched your messy desk.” 
“Are you sitting in a room?” I 
asked. 

“I’m in your study, Haroldkin,” 
she said, surprised. “Can’t you 
see?” 

“No, as a matter of fact, I 
can’t.” 

“Oh! Then I can throw out all 
these old papers?” 

“What old papers?” 

“Oh, I don’t know, Harold- 
kin,” Kate said. “You made such 
a fuss about failing that silly 
medical exam that you never let 
me touch your desk when you 
graduated in physics.” 

“Physics!” 

“Yes,” said Kate, throwing 
paper after paper onto the 
carpet. She made sweeping mo- 
tions in the air and dumped a 
mass of notes into her lap. They 
appeared on her fingertips, but 
they stayed in existence when 
she dropped them on the carpet. 

“How did I die?” I asked, 
bending down and thumbing 
rapidly over the papers. 



“A bomb went off,” she said. 
“I really don’t want to talk about 
it. But you were so eminent, 
Haroldkin!” 

I must have been very soft in 
the discrimination to have al- 
lowed that revolting nickname, I 
thought, but it was clear from 
the papers I was holding that I 
knew my physics. And there it 
was, printed in an issue of the 
Commission’s Journal that never 
existed in my time-space, the 
whole equation I was looking for. 
It was so obvious when I read 
it that I could not understand 
how I failed to think of it for 
myself — for my own myself, 
that is. 

When I looked up, this prob- 
able Kate had gone. I wanted 
to thank her, but the evening 
would do. Meanwhile, here was 
the ultra-uranium fourth octave 
equation. 

I called the laboratory, read it 
off to my assistant, and told him 
to get on with the test. 

“Right, Chief. I’ll go down 
myself and give you a report 
when I get back.” 

I said fine and took the rest 
of the day off. It was the peak 
of my career so far, and from 
the widow Kate’s comments, it 
seemed as if I had a great 
probable career to come. Of 
course, I would have to redouble 
our safety precautions at the labs 
and it would be best if I never 



went near the proving grounds. 
That other physicist me prob- 
ably made some error that I 
would avoid, being forewarned. 

By evening, I decided to try to 
locate that probable Kate again, 
to thank her, and to find out 
exactly how that poor me blew 
himself up with a bomb. With 
care, I recalled the perfume and 
also the musty smell of the 
papers, for I did not want Dr. 
Harold K. Jones’ Kate appearing. 
Then I removed all other odor- 
iferous substances from the bed- 
room, took three pills and was 
about to lie down to sleep when 



my assistant called to report on 
the test. 

“That you. Chief? What a 
success! We’re made. Your 
name’s in lights. Chief! It was the 
most colossal explosion I’ve ever 
seen. It burned the area like 
toast. It even smelled like toast, 
with a touch of ozone and 
sulphur. Very strong smell ...” 
“Stop!” I screamed. “Stop!” 
But it was too late. I could 
smell it clearly as he had de- 
scribed it. And now the pills are 
working. How in the name of 
heaven am I going to stay awake? 
Because once I fall asleep .

CAN DO 
ANYTHING 



When a man makes that claim, don't make 
the mistake of asking him to prove it. 

BY J. T. MclNTOSH 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



T rouble was brewing 
at Nick’s. There was 
nothing surprising in 
that — it was payday at the 
mines, and miners are the same 
all over the Galaxy. In some 
places, however, they’re more 
the same than others, and Cron- 
feld was easily the toughest of 
the so-called civilized worlds. 

Ricky Chiotza, the big Blue 
Star foreman, was in the early 
stages of the slow burn which in 
due course would inevitably 



reach the point of spontaneous 
combustion. Trouble was, some- 
body had stolen Rickses girl 
He didn’t know who, any more 
than he knew precisely who his 
girl was, but if there was one 
thing sure it was that Ricky 
Chiotza was going to get the guy. 

Occasionally Chiotza shot 
black looks at Sammy Talbot, 
who had taken a hundred dol- 
lars from him in a poker game, 
the night before. Except when 
he was drunk, as he was now. 



100 



GALAXY 




that slick so-and-so was too 
smart for his own good. Chiotza 
swore every week never to play 
poker with him again — and 
every week he joined the game 
in the hope of getting back what 
he’d lost the week before. 

Most of the ladies — that was 
the polite name for them — had 
scented the raw passion that was 
writhing in the garish, smoke- 
filled air of Nick’s, and had pru- 
dently retired to powder their 
noses. Some thirty big, sweating. 



unsteady, check-shirted, woman- 
less miners were left, drinking 
neat whisky like beer, talking in 
loud, belligerent tones and lis- 
tening to nobody else. 

Sammy Talbot, the smallest 
man in the room, was rapidly 
reaching the state of furious 
drunkenness when he would tell 
the world at the top of his voice 
that he could do anything. 
When that happened, the effects 
were predictable. Sammy’s luck 
with cards didn’t make him pop- 
ular with the men who had been 
losing regularly to him for years. 
Nobody believed that he had 
any superhuman abilities, and it 
was quite true that with cards 
he hadn’t — he just happened to 
be a good poker player. 

Drunk, as he was now, Sammy 
wasn’t so smart. Sammy was 
quite likely to pick a fight with 
Ricky Chiotza, who was three 
inches taller and thirty pounds 
heavier than Sammy. Afterward, 
someone would rustle up Cliff 
Burns from whatever high so- 
ciety function he happened to be 
honoring with his presence, and 
Cliff, after cursing for a minute 
or two, would come and scrape 
up what was left of Sammy. 

/^UTSIDE Nick’s it rained as 
it could rain only in Cron- 
feld. There was no wind — there 
seldom was. Cronfeld had virtu- 
ally no weather except blasting 



heat, rain, fog and, occasionally, 
snow. The rain poured patiently 
out of the dark sky, keeping the 
paved road perpetually four 
inches deep in water despite the 
efficiency of the drainage — - 
drainage on Cronfeld had to be 
efficient or there was no use 
messing with it — and elsewhere 
trying to prove, despite millions 
of years of experimental evi- 
dence to the contrary that sili- 
con dust would eventually dis- 
solve in water. 

Across the street from Nick’s 
was the Garden, the West End 
of the mining town. You 
couldn’t be on the right or wrong 
side of the tracks on Cronfeld, 
there being no railroad. But you 
could be a miner or something 
else. If you were a miner, you 
lived in the shacks or the hostels, 
fought, drank, sweated, ate like 
a pig and died like a wolf, torn 
to pieces by the rest of the pack. 
If you weren’t a miner, you lived 
in Garden City, wore expensive 
clothes or impractical clothes to 
prove you weren’t a miner, and 
spent your whole life insisting 
vehemently that there really was 
cultured, educated society on 
Cronfeld. 

There is no upper set quite 
so frenetically gay, quite so ex- 
travagant, quite so artificial, as 
a privileged class which exists 
side by side with an exceedingly 
underprivileged group. The vast 

GALAXY 



contrasts of the French Revolu- 
tion, the Tsarist regime and the 
Great Depressions weren’t curi- 
ous, inexplicable accidents. 

No more than two hundred 
yards from Nick’s, Cliff Burns 
adjusted his already perfect 
white tie, smoothed his impec- 
cable tails, and surveyed the 
scene in the Benjamin ballroom 
with carefully assumed boredom. 
There had been a mix-up and 
half the guests had thought it 
was a fancy dress ball and the 
other half hadn’t. It didn’t mat- 
ter — everybody agreed that this 
only made it a better party than 
ever. 

The floor and the walls were 
of glass, the drapes dull crimson. 
An enormous crystal staircase 
curved voluptuously into the 
ballroom itself, and in the center 
of the glass floor a fountain cas- 
caded, lit by concealed colored 
lights. The guests were pale and 
antiseptically clean, for on a 
dirty, muddy world where it was 
easy to acquire a deep brown 
tan it was naturally a mark of 
quality ' to be spotlessly clean 
and pale as a white orchid. 
Everybody was having a won- 
derful time, and the gayest of 
all were the people who secretly 
wished they were in bed and 
asleep. 

The orchestra was playing a 
Strauss waltz. Strauas himself 
had been buried four centuries 

I CAN DO ANYTHING 



ago on a world 773 light-years 
away, but nobody thought there 
was ans^hing odd in playing his 
music on Cronfeld. You could 
be cultured and still listen to 
Strauss, and he was a lot easier 
to listen to than Beethoven, 
Brahms, Mozart or any of that 
crowd. 

A blonde in black tights 
flicked her whip at Cliff’s white 
tie, laughing shrilly, but he 
hardly looked at her. He was 
looking for Shirley Benjamin. 

He needn’t have bothered. 
The daughter of the house could 
hardly be expected to make an 
ordinary, unheralded entrance. 
Abruptly the orchestra stopped 
playing Voices of Spring, went 
into Lovely to Look At, and 
Shirley slowly descended the 
crystal staircase, regally alone, 
to polite applause. 

ipROWNING, Cliff moved for- 
^ ward to meet her at the foot 
of the stairs. Before he could 
say anything, she giggled and 
said: “I know. Cliff. You’re 

angry because I’m not wearing 
your ring. Don’t be mean. Cliff. 
That would spoil it. Don’t you 
see the idea? No earrings, neck- 
lace, ring, bangles — ” 

“I see the idea all right,” Cliff 
growled. 

She laughed again. “Oh, I get 
it. You don’t want anybody to 
see me like this but you, is that 



102 



103 



it? Go ahead, Cliff, be jealous. 
That’s all right.” 

He choked back his annoy- 
ance with an effort. He simply 
couldn’t afford to quarrel with 
Shirley. She represented his one 
chance of escape from Cronfeld. 

“Well, if you aren’t going to 
ask me to dance,” she said, 
piqued, “I can easily find some- 
body else . .” 

The orchestra was playing a 
slow drag. He took her in his 
arms and they moved out on the 
floor. If he had dared he would 
have sent her back upstairs to 
put on more clothes. But there 
was too much at stake — and you 
didn’t tell Shirley Benjamin 
what she could and couldn’t do. 

Mamma and Papa Benjamin 
were looking on dotingly. No 
hope of support there. In their 
eyes Shirley could do no wrong. 
Unwillingly Cliff admitted to 
himself that it was just as well 
that they felt like that, for if 
Shirley hadn’t been allowed to 
do exactly as she chose there 
wouldn’t have been much 
chance of Cliff Burns ever suc- 
ceeding in becoming engaged to 
her. 

Gradually Cliffs annoyance 
subsided. Every man in the 
room envied him, he knew, and 
probably most of them knew 
that Shirley wasn’t going to close 
her bedroom door on him after 
the ball. Long ago, when he was 



planning his campaign to marry 
Shirley and escape from Cron- 
feld, he had decided that Shirley 
was the kind of girl who would 
be easier to marry afterward if 
he’d seduced her first, who would 
be easier to hold if she thought 
she had to work to hold him. 

Naturally he had never al- 
lowed her to suspect that he’d 
have married the sleaziest girl 
from Nick’s if that would have 
gotten him off Cronfeld. 

He was just beginning to en- 
joy himself when he felt a tug 
at his sleeve. “Excuse me,” the 
butler murmured. “Phone call.” 

Cliff stepped away from Shir- 
ley with a muffled curse. Why 
couldn’t Sammy keep out of 
trouble for just one night? He 
forced his lips to smile. “Excuse 
me, darling.” 

It was Bill Monkton, phoning 
from Nick’s. Uptown and Down- 
town had only one thing in com- 
mon — the telephone system. But 
even that wasn’t as egalitarian 
as it might be. Every instrument 
in Garden City had a red light 
on it which lit up wamingly 
whenever the call was from the 
Jungle. And if you didn’t want 
to be soiled by even telephonic 
contact, you didn’t need to take 
the call. 

The red light was on now. 

“Sammy’s going to get hurt,” 
Monkton whined. “Chiotza is 
spoiling for a fight, and any mo- 



104 



GALAXY 



ment Sammy is going to oblige 
him. Chiotza will kill Sammy.” 

Monkton wasn’t very bright. 
Cliff thought, if it had never oc- 
curred to him that nothing 
would suit Cliff better. But de- 
spite the trouble Sammy was 
always getting into and the 
number of fights he lost, Sammy 
never did get killed, and Cliff 
was getting impatient. 

“What’s the good of telling 
me that?” Cliff demanded. “I 
can’t come over there and drag 
Sammy out of it, can I? Call 
again if anything happens.” 

¥TE hurried back to the ball- 
¥-■- room. Shirley was on the 
bandstand, her supple torso 
writhing rhsdhmically in an ex- 
hibition that was five per cent 
dance and ninety-five per cent 
sex. Cliff pulled her down from 
the stand, not very gently. He 
was angry again. It offended his 
dignity that the girl he was go- 
ing to marry should act like a 
tramp. 

“That low-life pal of yours 
again. Cliff?” Shirley said. 
“What’s he got on you?” 

“We knew each other on 
Earth,” Cliff said easily. It was 
a lie — he had met Sammy for 
the first time on Cronfeld. 

They had barely started 
dancing again when Cliff was 
called to the phone once more. 
This time he didn’t muffle his 



curses. Shirley giggled and blew 
him a kiss. 

“He ain’t hurt bad,” Monkton 
said over the phone. “You’ve 
seen him a lot worse.” 

“Where is he?” 

“In the gutter outside Nick’s.” 

Cliff cut the connection and 
called a taxi. It came right to 
the door, close against the can- 
opy, so that he could step into 
it without getting wet. “Nick’s,” 
he snapped. 

The cab splashed diagonally 
across the road and stopped be- 
side a limp form face down in 
the gutter. “Lift him in,” said 
Cliff. 

“I can’t do it alone,” the 
cabbie complained. “I need 
help.” 

He got it, but not from Cliff. 
A slight figure dashed from the 
side door at Nick’s, a figure in 
a shapeless raincoat. At first an- 
noyed, for no particular reason. 
Cliff suddenly smiled. This girl, 
whoever she was, could see 
Sammy home, and he could go 
right back to the party. ' 

Between them the taxi-driver 
and the girl hoisted Sammy into 
the back of the car and propped 
him in a comer. Cliff kept well 
into the opposite corner, hoping 
his immaculate clothes weren’t 
going to be soiled. 

“Get in,” Cliff told the girl 
curtly. 

She blinked, but obeyed. 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



105 



Suddenly Sammy turned his 
head and saw Cliff. He tried to 
get up. “I’m not staying in the 
same room with that guy,” he 
said indistinctly but vehemently. 

“You’re not in a room, you’re 
in a taxi,” the girl said sooth- 
ingly. 

“Susie . What are you doing 
here with this heel, Susie? Let 
me get at him and I’ll — ” 

“You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself, Sammy. Every time 
you get into trouble, Mr. Burns 
always comes and gets you out 
of it.” 

Cliff was startled. Although 
he’d never seen this girl Susie 
before, apparently she knew all 
about him. 

“He gets paid for it,” Sammy 
muttered. 

“Sammy!” Cliff exclaimed. 
“Watch what you’re saying!” 

“You’re my keeper. You get 
paid to keep an eye on me. You 
wish I was dead, but any time 
I get in trouble you’ve got to 
haul me out in case I die and 
you’re held responsible. But 
you’re really only looking for a 
chance to finish off the job some 
time when you’re absolutely cer- 
tain the first guy is going to get 
blamed for the whole thing — ” 

Forgetting his concern over 
his clothes. Cliff brushed Susie 
aside and slapped Sammy hard 
on both cheeks. Instantly he 
foimd himself struggling with 



the girl. And she was winning. 

“Look,” he gasped. “I’ve had 
enough of this. You — what’s 
your name? — Susie, will you see 
that Sammy gets home?” 

She stopped struggling, puz- 
zled. She couldn’t make out 
whether Cliff was Sammy’s 
friend or not. 

“Sure,” she said. “Sure.” 

The taxi crossed the street 
again and Cliff got out. He paid 
the driver and stood back under 
the canopy of the Benjamin 
house. The car sloshed away, 
sending out bow waves like a 
speedboat. 

JAMMY’S room at the miners’ 
hostel was untidy but not 
dirty. There were signs that he 
wasn’t just an ordinary miner — 
books, a water color or two, a 
chess game he was working 
through. 

Such evidences of a not un- 
cultured background weren’t un- 
known among the miners. The 
only good reason to become a 
miner on Cronfeld was to escape 
the law, and usually men who 
chose this way of escape were 
quite unaware that the law was 
perfectly satisfied to know that 
they were there. Occasionally 
men escaped from jails and often 
men were released from jails. 
But nobody ever came back 
from the minefields of Cronfeld. 
Once a miner, you were stuck 



106 



GALAXY 



on Cronfeld for life. There was 
nothing to stop people from the 
Garden traveling on the space 
freighters which carried the 
more valuable ores back to the 
inner worlds. It was easier, how- 
ever, to get through the eye of 
a needle than to make the short 
journey from the Jungle to the 
Garden. Money didn’t help. The 
miners were reasonably well 
paid, and it was no secret that 
Sammy, the poker king, must 
have thousands stashed away 
somewhere. But money alone 
couldn’t get him into the Gar- 
den. No social door had ever 
been more tightly bolted and 
barred than the door of the 
Garden against the Jungle. 

The authorities on many 
worlds were well aware of this. 
Criminals and undesirables were 
often helped on their way, with- 
out having the faintest suspicion 
of the fact, by the police of the 
country or world they were 
leaving. 

Susie found a rag and soaked 
it at the cracked sink. 

“I c’n do anything,” Sammy 
uttered. 

“Sure you can,” said Susie, 
working on his injuries, which 
weren’t serious this time. 

Susie wasn’t as pretty as 
Shirley Benjamin. In fact, she 
wasn’t pretty at all, although she 
had a passable figure. A girl 
didn’t have to be pretty on a 



world like Cronfeld. Merely to 
be young was enough, and Susie 
was about eighteen. She had 
nevertheless been one of Nick’s 
girls for six years, which 
meant that in some kinds of ex- 
perience she was as old as time. 

“I c’n do anything,” Sammy 
insisted, turning his head petu- 
lantly away from her. “If I liked, 
I could . Susie, I’ve told you 
before. They sent me here be- 
cause . Look, Susie, I’m not a 
killer or a thief or a brute like 
the rest of them. I never did any- 
thing really bad — no more than 
you’d expect when a fellow can 
do anything he likes.” 

“Sure, honey,” said Susie 
tenderly. 

She had no other name but 
Susie. Having been sold to the 
proprietors of Nick’s at the age 
of three months, and then 
boarded out with one of Nick’s 
girls for twelve or thirteen years 
until she should become a com- 
mercial asset, Susie had natur- 
ally known very little tenderness 
in her life. Not that she had any 
complaints — people who have 
things tough right from birth 
rarely do have complaints. When 
she met S^mmy, however, it had 
been like a door of a prison 
opening into a lovely, sunny 
valley. 

Sammy wasn’t much. He was 
always pitying himself, and get- 
ting drunk whenever he had a 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



107 



chance, and playing the same old 
bombastic I-can-do-anything rec- 
ord whenever he got drunk. But 
Sammy was nice to her in a 
way no one had ever been be- 
fore. 

Sometimes she cried when she 
thought of it. Imagine anybody 
realizing she had feelings! And 
not merely realizing she had 
feelings, but respecting them. 

Once he had tried to give her 
money, a lot of money. She 
hadn’t counted it, but it seemed 
to Susie’s astonished eyes to be 
more money than she had be- 
lieved, to that moment, existed 
in all of Cronfeld. 

“Go on, take it,” he had said. 
“It’s no good to me. I can’t use 
it to get off Cronfeld. You might, 
if you went the right way about 
it.” 

But when he had seen that 
she was refusing the money be- 
cause of finer feelings than he 
had credited her with, he apol- 
ogized sincerely, treating her 
with such respect and courtesy 
that she felt ashamed. At the 
same time, womanlike, she loved 
him more for it. 

I T WAS a pity that he got 
drtmk. Susie had grown up 
with hard liquor, trained to 
make the men with her drink 
as much as possible, and Sammy 
was the only man she ever tried 
to stop drinking. Drunk, he was 



like any man. Sober, there was 
something fine about Sammy. 

“That Cliff Burns . .” Sammy 
whispered, with loathing. 

“Honey, I don’t get it about 
you and him. Does he really get 
paid, like you said? Like Norma 
was paid to look after me?” 
“I’m not suposed to talk about 
it.” 

“Sure, honey, but you keep 
talking about it all the same. 
You keep saying that you can 
do anything, but you’re not 
supposed to, and you’re not even 
supposed to talk about it, and 
Cliff Burns gets paid for looking 
after you, but you’re not sup- 
posed to talk about that either.” 
Although when other people 
said such things Sammy flew in- 
to a blind rage, Susie’s tone was 
so warm and sjrmpathetic that 
he couldn’t be angry. 

“Maybe I should try to ex- 
plain it to you, Susie. A guy’s 
got to talk to somebody, some- 
time ... I spent four years on 
a dead planet once. This planet 
hasn’t even a name, but the 
race that used to live there 
called it Xyt. It was four years 
before I was picked up — ” 

“I know, honey,” said Susie 
patiently. “Y ou told me.” 

“I’m not supposed to tell any- 
body. More than that, I’m not 
supposed to do anything. That’s 
why Cliff Burns is here. If I do 
anything, he’s free to scramble 



108

me. Then he can leave here. But 
if he scrambles me and can’t 
prove I did ansdhing, he’ll be 
sent back — as a miner this time. 
I’m safe from Cliff so long as I 
don’t—” 

“Honey, you just don’t make 
no sense.” 

His head ached. The raw 
whisky was still working on him. 
He knew, however, that even 
sober he’d be unable to make 
Susie believe what he said, and 
understand it. Susie was loyal 
and generous. She had a certain 
shrewdness which had once 
made him hope that there was 
something to work on in her 
dark head. He had discovered 
however, that she was com- 
pletely lacking in imagination, 
and that her shrewdness was 
merely the cunning any deter- 
mined animal develops in jungle 
conditions. 

She couldn’t understand any- 
thing outside her own experi- 
ence, and in her experience peo- 
ple like Sammy and people liWp 
Cliff could never have anything 
in common. Just as miners never 
crossed the figurative tracks to 
the Garden, people from the 
Garden never sank to the miners’ 
level. If the charity of their 
friends didn’t keep them from 
disaster, the3^d lie and cheat and 
steal to stay in the Garden — and 
if that failed, there was always 
suicide. 



“If only you’d believe me, 
Susie,” Sammy whispered, “it 
wouldn’t be so bad. I can do 
anything, Susie — except control 
the encephalograph Cliff’s got 
hidden somewhere. It would 
give me away. And if I make 
him show me where he keeps 
the scrambler and the ence- 
phalograph, it only lands me in 
deeper trouble. And it’s no good 
killing Cliff. He makes two 
phone calls every morning at ten 
o’clock, and if he doesn’t make 
them I’ll be scrambled any- 
way — ” 

“Don’t talk about killing, 
Sammy. Killing never did no 
one no good.” 

“I never wanted to kill any- 
body but Cliff. That’s all. I hate 
his guts.” 

“That never did no one no 
good neither.” 

“Don’t you hate anybody, 
Susie?” 

She stared at him. “Me? Who 
would I hate?” 

He said nothing. A few min- 
utes later she saw he was a- 
sleep. Sighing, she took off her 
garish dance frock and lay down 
beside him. He was trembling 
as he always did when he slept. 
She knew about that. It was the 
Dream. 

Poor Sammy. She loved him, 
pitied him, and admired him, all 
at once. But most of all she 
loved him. 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



109 



OHIRLEY’S bedroom was like 
^ something out of the France 
of Louis Quinze. The bed was 
an enormous four-poster with 
silk curtains which could be 
drawn for privacy within pri- 
vacy. The dressing table was al- 
most as massive as the bed, with 
three huge mirrors in which she 
could see herself in triplicate — 
you couldn’t have too much of 
a good thing — or examine the 
back of her head if she wanted 
to. There were big cut-glass jars 
of cosmetics and silver-backed 
hairbrushes. And there was 
Shirley, standing in front of the 
three mirrors and looking at her- 
self with satisfaction. 

She still wore her ball dress. 
For the moment she had for- 
gotten Cliff, standing behind her, 
in her pleasure in her own beau- 
tiful body. 

“Shirley,” said Cliff, “I want to 
talk to you.” 

She pouted. It was hardly a 
compliment when a man admit- 
ted to her bedroom after the 
party was over wanted to talk. 

Cliff realized his mistake at 
once. In a moment he was be- 
hind her, pulling her against him 
and gently stroking her. She be- 
gan to writhe in anticipatory 
pleasure. 

“There’s nothing to talk about. 
Cliff,” she whispered. “The pas- 
sages are booked. We leave on 
the next ship, in two weeks’ 



time. Isn’t that what you 
wanted?” 

“So soon?” Cliff breathed. 

“You’ve been trying to get me 
to fix it for so long . Daddy 
finally agreed this morning. I 
knew it would be a wonderful 
surprise for you. Cliff.” 

It was a wonderful surprise, 
but it was also a shock. Although 
he automatically went on ca- 
ressing Shirley, Cliff had almost 
forgotten her existence. His 
thoughts were racing, and they 
weren’t thoughts of Shirley 
Benjamin. 

When he’d been sent to Cron- 
feld to keep an eye on Sammy 
Talbot, he had thanked his chief 
with heartfelt sincerity. It had 
been that or a jail sentence for 
his negligence in killing a girl 
prisoner. Banishment on full 
salary to a world with civilized 
society seemed, at the time, in- 
finitely preferable to jail. 

He had even admired, at the 
time, the chiefs solution to the 
whole problem. The chief had 
made no secret of the fact that 
he wanted Sammy scrambled, 
but the court had shown unex- 
pected clemency, as courts some- 
times did. Neither Cliff nor the 
chief really believed the stories 
about Sammy Talbot, but that 
wasn’t the point. Scrambled, 
Sammy could be released, could 
be forgotten. Unscrambled, Sam- 
my had to be watched. There 

GALAXY 




no 



111 



was no doubt that Sammy could 
do something. 

After three years, Cliff had 
changed his mind. The court’s 
merciful ruling — ^that Sammy 

was not to be scrambled unless 
or until he used his trick again 
— meant that Cliff was tied up 
on Cronfeld, that he had to em- 
ploy a couple of assistants there, 
that every ship from Cronfeld 
had to be carefully checked . 
in short, the court’s ruling meant 
that instead of the Sammy Tal- 
bot case being firmly closed 
when he was caught, as it should 
have been, it stayed open until 
Sammy obligingly got himself 
killed or gave Cliff reasonable 
grounds for scrambling him. 

In three years, Sammy had 
done neither. 

Cliff wasn’t worried about 
anything Sammy might do. 
Sammy was such a whining, 
boasting, irritable, ineffectual 
character that it was impossible 
to be worried about anything he 
might do. Nevertheless, to be on 
the safe side. Cliff had always 
acted as if Sammy really was 
dangerous. 

He had two auxiliaries. Monk- 
ton, who worked beside Sammy, 
ate with him and drank with 
him, and Keig, who lived in the 
Garden and had never seen 
Sammy. Each of them had a de- 
tector and a preset scrambler 
unit, and their job was to use 



the latter if the former ever 
showed anything. 

Sammy might nullify Monk- 
ton, but he could hardly cancel 
out Keig, of whose existence he 
knew nothing. Sammy was hog- 
tied and he knew it. 

Cliff trusted Monkton and 
Keig for the excellent reason 
that they didn’t dare cross him 
and they knew it. 

Lieutenant Gibson of the 
Cronfeld police also knew some- 
thing about Sammy and about 
Cliff’s responsibility for him — 
not much, but something. 

In fact, scores of people were 
involved in the safety measures 
taken against the whining, in- 
effectual Sammy — and all be- 
cause a court on Earth had said, 
“No, don’t scramble him yet.” 

Naturally Cliff had thought of- 
ten enough about scrambling 
Sammy and going back home 
with a convincing explanation. 
Unfortunately, he knew that he 
wasn’t going to be convincing 
enough. Once Sammy Talbot 
was no longer a problem. Cliff 
could go back to Earth — that 
had been the agreement. But 
Cliff had been assured that un- 
less he returned with ironclad 
proof that he’d had to scramble 
Sammy, he would be on the next 
ship back to Cronfeld — and this 
time he wouldn’t be residing in 
the Garden. 

“I thought you’d be pleased,” 



112 



GALAXY 



Shirley said. “Daddy didn’t want 
to let me go. If you’d rather stay 
here, I can soon — ” 

“Of course I’m pleased,” said 
Cliff. “I’m speechless.” 

“Well, you don’t have to talk,” 
said Shirley. “There are other 
ways of expressing your appre- 
ciation.” 

Idly Cliff wondered how a 
girl in Shirley’s position could 
be so insecure that she needed 
so much reassurance. There 
were rumors that she had been 
an unattractive child, strange as 
that seemed now — did that ex- 
plain everything? 

In any case, there was no 
doubt about what he had to do 
now. 

It was surprising how being 
compelled to do a thing turned 
what should have been a great 
pleasure into rather a bore. 

^^HE DREAM was always the 
same. First, Sammy lived 
through the crash again. Every- 
body but himself had been killed 
instantly. 

It had been one of those 
hyperspace disasters which no 
spaceman ever thought about, 
just as an airplane pilot with no 
parachute didn’t think about 
crack-up in mid-air. There was 
no percentage in it. If you were 
spewed out of hyperspace, your 
chance of rescue was no chance 
— ^not one in a million, not one 



in any number of millions — not 
any. 

Nobody was going to come 
out of a hyperspace vector vol- 
untarily, that was for sure. The 
hyperspace routes were so care- 
fully established that you didn’t 
work them out any more; you 
fed the right card into the ship’s 
computer. There was no card 
for the world on which Sammy’s 
ship crashed. The chance of any 
other Terran ship arriving there 
was like the chance of a collision 
between the only car on the 
American continent and the only 
car in Australia. 

Sammy, who had been an or- 
dinary spaceman then, survived 
the crash because he was thrown 
against a padded bulkhead 
which broke loose and careened 
on through the ship, to be 
stopped gradually by an alumi- 
num water tank which acted as 
a giant hydraulic brake. Not un- 
expectedly, nobody else was as 
fortunate. 

He found himself on a cold 
desert world which had obvi- 
ously once been hot, a world 
with the right kind of air but 
not quite enough of it, and once 
he fully comprehended his situa- 
tion he honestly wished there 
had been no survivors. 

The ship was less than a 
wreck; it wasn’t even a shelter. 
And there was no life, no water, 
in the desert in which it lay. 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



113 



Since his death from lack of air, 
food and water was only a 
matter of time, Sammy’s deci- 
sion to make for the mountains 
he could see to the north was 
not unreasonable. 

He reached the mountains 
fairly easily and found that they 
enclosed a vast valley at the 
bottom of which there was 
enough trapped air for his needs. 
So he wasn’t going to die of 
lack of air, after all. 

There was also a stream 
whose waters he found he could 
drink without ill effects. He 
wasn’t going to die of thirst, 
either. 

Although there was an abun- 
dance of small animals little 
larger than rats but much less 
active, it seemed for some time 
that this fact wasn’t going to 
help him much. Every time he 
killed and ate one of them, he 
was violently sick. He eventually 
discovered, however, that it was 
the mixture of Terran and native 
food that his stomach couldn’t 
stand. It could and did adapt to 
the animal life of Xsrt. So 
neither was he going to die of 
hunger. 

He still didn’t look on his 
future on Xsrt with any enthusi- 
asm — not even when he found 
the ruins. 

For two years the ruins in the 
valley and the things he foimd 
in them meant no more to Sam- 



my than something to keep him 
sane. It transpired that the 
Xjdiians had used a kind of 
paper which was less destruct- 
ible than their stone and metal 
buildings, and which the small 
animals couldn’t eat. Conse- 
quently Xytian literature sur- 
vived complete when even their 
strongest buildings and machines 
had collapsed in rust and ruin. 

At the end of two years 
Sammy was reading Xytian lit- 
erature voraciously. Even chil- 
dren’s primers had survived, and 
consequently learning the lan- 
guage presented no great prob- 
lem to a man with unlimited 
time on his hands. He would 
never be able to speak it, of 
course; but since there would 
never be anyone, Xytian or 
human, to speak it to, this 
hardly seemed to matter. 

The Xytians must have been 
very nearly human mentally, al- 
though physically there had 
been few resemblances. Xytian 
anecdotes made sense to Sammy, 
even if they never managed to 
make him laugh. He didn’t do 
much laughing on Xyt. 

At the end of three years 
Sammy was beginning to under- 
stand Power. Power was the 
nearest equivalent to the Xytian 
word. Power had been outlawed 
among the Xsrtians, and yet it 
had killed them off in the end. 
Presumably, like most outlawed 



114 



GALAXY 



things, it was used by outlaws. 

Power was a means of doing 
an3d:hing — or, rather, of making 
anybody else do anything. It was 
partly telepathic, but mainly a 
technique for control of another 
person through the unconscious. 
In other words, it wasn’t very 
far removed from hypnotism. 

A human being given a post- 
hypnotic command to do some- 
thing, no matter how unreason- 
able, will dream up a reason for 
doing it which he is convinced 
is the real reason. X5?tian Power 
went several stages further. In 
the first place, since it was tele- 
pathic, words weren’t needed. In 
the second place, since the so- 
called unconscious was always 
conscious, even in sleep, it was 
always accessible. Third, the un- 
conscious had no natural defens- 
es — you could invade another 
person’s unconscious without 
having to get past it. Fourth, 
once you’d done what you 
wanted to do in the victim’s un- 
conscious, his own conscious was 
on your side, working for you. 

At this point in his researches 
Sammy was still merely reading 
for something to do. There 
wasn’t much direct instruction 
about Power in X3dian litera- 
ture, naturally enough, since it 
was an illegal technique. But 
there was plenty about tele- 
pathy, which was perfectly legal. 
And one day when his studies 



of Xytian mental science were 
sufficiently advanced, Sammy 
read a paper explaining how 
telephathy worked through hy- 
perspace. 

The Xytians knew nothing of 
space travel. They knew nothing 
of hyperspace as an extension of 
a point-to-point flight, a way of 
getting from A to B without hav- 
ing to traverse all the distance 
between A and B. 

Being a telepathic race, they 
knew hyperspace only as a me- 
dium for telepathic communica- 
tion. They had been in tele- 
pathic communication with at 
least a score of intelligent races 
in the universe. Not Earthmen — 
at that time the ancestors of 
Earthmen had been swimming 
about in the sea. 

It was then that Sammy had 
his first wild hope of rescue. 
Could he learn telepathy? Could 
he learn Power? 

Could he make Terrans in 
Terran ships come to Xyt for 
him? 

CAMMY groaned and turned 

over. But the noise which 
had disturbed him went on. 

He sat up, blinding pain in 
his temples. Susie was asleep be- 
side him, so deeply asleep that 
the noise of the telephone out in 
the hall didn’t bother her. 

Still drunk, Sammy climbed 
out of bed and staggered into 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



115 



the hall. Vaguely wondering why 
the ringing had disturbed no- 
body else, he remembered that 
Smith and Proctor, who had the 
two nearest rooms, had both 
been with girls at Nick’s and 
probably wouldn’t be back until 
morning. 

“Huzza?” he said into the 
phone. 

Cliff, too, had left a woman 
sleeping. Shirley, like Susie, was 
a very deep sleeper, and that 
was what had given Cliff his 
idea. The evidence of a mistress 
wasn’t always enough for the 
police, but on Cronfeld the testi- 
mony of a Benjamin — if it 
should happen to be asked — was 
the strongest, safest, most abso- 
lute evidence there was. 

Some girls would object to 
giving testimony like that. But 
not Shirley. Shirley was quite 
open about her relations with 
Cliff. She boasted about them, 
as if she’d been the ugliest girl 
on Cronfeld instead of one of 
the prettiest. 

She would say he had been 
with her all night — if necessary. 

“Sammy, this is Cliff. No, 
don’t hang up — this is 
vital. Sammy, you and I both 
want to get away from Cron- 
feld. Well, has it ever occurred 
to you that if we work together, 
we can do it — both of us?” 

Sammy was drunker than he 
had been when he had fallen 



asleep. Yet Cliff’s words made 
sense. Sure, he hated Cliff 
Burns, his keeper — his warden. 
Nevertheless, he had thought 
long ago, apparently long before 
the idea had occurred to Cliff, 
that if the two of them worked 
together there ought to be a way 
in which they could both get 
what they wanted. 

“Listen, Sammy, is Susie still 
with you?” 

Sammy looked around owl- 
ishly. There was no sign of 
Susie. “No,” he said. “She isn’t 
here.” 

“Okay. Sammy, I’ve got to see 
you right away. Up by Ricky 
Chiotza’s place. At the back, 
where — ” 

“I’m not going near that guy,” 
said Sammy emphatically. “Had 
a fight with him. Bastard hit me 
with a bottle.” 

Cliff had guessed as much. 
“It’s just a place to meet, Sam- 
my,” he said. “We’re not going 
to see Chiotza. We’re just going 
to talk in that old shed behind 
his house — to be out of the rain.” 

Sammy thought tortuously. 
The shed behind Chiotza’s house. 
“Okay,” he said, and hung up. 

He looked down. He was stark 
naked. Well, that was all right 
— no sense in getting his clothes 
wet. 

Why, he wondered vaguely, 
was he going to the shed behind 
Chiotza’s? To meet Cliff. Cliff 



116 



GALAXY 



had an idea to get them both off 
Cronfeld. Might as well hear it. 
Could always say no. Would say 
no, unless Susie could come too. 

He staggered downstairs and 
out at the back door. The rain 
still poured steadily. Sammy 
didn’t mind — it felt good on his 
skin. 

Chiotza’s house was only a 
few hundred yards away. Sam- 
my skirted it, went around be- 
hind it, pushed open the rickety 
door of the old shed. 

Where was that Cliff Burns? 

It had taken Sammy perhaps 
five minutes to reach the shed 
from the telephone in the hostel. 
Nevertheless, it seemed like a 
rank discourtesy that Cliff 
shouldn’t be waiting for him. 

He sat down on the stone 
floor, finding a piece of sacking 
to insulate his bare bottom from 
the concrete. Mus’ watch this 
Cliff, he thought. Capable of 
anything, that man. Mas’ be on 
my guard. 

On his guard, waiting for Cliff, 
Sammy fell asleep. 

/~\N the face of it, Sammy’s 
^ undertaking had been a 
pretty wild one. The Xytians 
had been a telepathic race. The 
very nature of their literature 
showed this clearly. What was 
written down, for the most part, 
was what minds were liable to 
forget, what one mind couldn’t 



easily pass to another mind, 
what was needed to supplement 
mental communication. 

Humans weren’t a telepathic 
race. It had been shown that 
they weren’t telepathically blind, 
deaf and dumb, that was all. 

But Sammy didn’t care how 
fantastic his plan was. It was 
far more realistic, certainly, than 
waiting hopefully for someone to 
come and rescue him. And he 
still dreamed of rescue. 

Soon he began to realize that 
his efforts weren’t so fantastic 
after all. What was personality, 
what was personal magnetism, 
but Power? Wasn’t it possible 
that even if a human conscious 
mind couldn’t reach out and 
touch another human conscious 
mind, it might be able to reach 
a human unconscious? Wasn’t 
there plenty of evidence in hu- 
man relations that it could? 

And the Xytians had not 
merely used telepathy, but also 
studied it, developed it, cata- 
logued it. There were exercises 
for X3Ttian children. Exercises in 
extending the consciousness. Ex- 
ercises in remembering-seeing- 
projection. Exercises in thought- 
direction. 

One day Sammy foimd he 
could control the little animals 
which had been his staple diet 
for three years. After that he 
hated eating them. It seemed in- 
human to bring them to him to 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



117 



be killed and make them stand 
while he killed them. Yet when 
he could do that, did it make 
sense to go out and try to stun 
them with stones, as he’d been 
doing for years? 

Power was a way of stabbing 
direct at the unconscious. All 
animals had an unconscious, and 
therefore all animals could be 
controlled by someone who had 
the Xytian Power. 

It was doubtful whether Sam- 
my, or anyone else, could have 
developed the faculty without 
such a stimulus. For Sammy, 
learning to operate Power, or not 
learning, was a matter of life or 
death. 

He learned. Or he thought he 
learned. How could he tell? The 
fact that he could control the 
Xytian creatures proved nothing 
beyond the fact that he had a 
stronger intellect than they, 
which was pretty obvious any- 
way. They could be the tele- 
paths. 

Anyway, he began broadcast- 
ing his commands. They should, 
if everything went according to 
plan, be going out by hyper- 
space. They should reach Earth, 
or more particularly, any Terran 
ship in space. They should slide 
direct into the imconscious 
minds of Terran spacemen, who 
should then seek them to their 
source, not knowing why they 
really did so, but inventing for 



their own satisfaction perfectly 
good reasons why they should . 

The ship arrived four years 
and ten days after Samms^s ship 
was wrecked. It was a survey 
ship, and the members of the 
crew were all convinced that 
they had been ordered to survey 
this section of space. 

For a long time after that 
Sammy didn’t attempt to use 
Power again. It could have been 
a coincidence that the survey 
ship came to Xyt. In due course 
he would know for sure. In any 
case, although the survey team 
examined and photographed the 
Xytian remains, Sammy cau- 
tiously refrained from showing 
them any Xytian literature. It 
naturally didn’t occur to them 
that any could have survived. 

B ack on Earth, Sammy con- 
tinued to be cautious for a 
while. But why should he work 
if people could be made to want 
to help him, support him, love 
him? 

Any doubt that he possessed 
Power was soon at an end. He 
could do anything he wanted — 
or make others do anything he 
wanted. 

With certain exceptions. 
About one person in a hundred 
was somehow blocked to him. 
Power just didn’t work with 
these rare individuals. 

It didn’t seem to matter. Sam- 



118 



GALAXY 



my never found it vitally neces- 
sary to have any truck with 
these stubborn, intractable peo- 
ple — invariably men and women 
who were resistant to hypnosis, 
too. 

For nearly a year Earth paid 
him back for the loneliness he 
had suffered on Xyt. Earth re- 
imbursed him willingly, gladly. 
People loved Sammy Talbot and 
didn’t know why they loved him. 
It didn’t matter — they could, 
and did, invent plenty of rea- 
sons. 

On the whole, Sammy wasn’t 
too ambitious or too cruel. That 
was what saved him later. He 
merely took what he wanted, 
making others want to give. 
When he tired of anything or 
anyone, he always neatly 
rounded off the incident in a 
way which gave pain to no one. 

He did some good, too. Sam- 
my could touch the unconscious 
direct. And when people were 
miserable, or when people were 
insane, it was because of some- 
thing wrong in the unconscious, 
something which Sammy could 
set right. 

But he did take a lot . 

The police must have done a 
good job. Of course, they had 
the evidence of those rare in- 
dividuals whom Sammy couldn’t 
touch. They even used a couple 
of them as assistants. All the 
same, it must have been quite a 



job, tracing everything back to 
Sammy and believing the in- 
credible. It would have been 
impossible if Sammy had actu- 
ally been able to read minds. 
But he couldn’t. He could mere- 
ly control other people’s uncon- 
scious minds. 

Another thing that helped the 
cops was the fact, unknown to 
Sammy, that when he used 
Power, encephalographs for 
miles around went mad. Indeed, 
before they took him in they had 
developed a small, simple de- 
tector which was nothing like 
as complicated as an encephalo- 
graph but which detected Power 
activity at a range of several 
miles. 

After that, Sammy was 
hooked. 

V^f/HILE he was drugged, a 
police surgeon inserted a 
tiny instrument in a cavity in 
his skull. From then on Sammy 
could be scrambled at any time, 
at any distance up to a hundred 
miles. 

And so Sammy, with his mag- 
nificent Power, was as helpless 
as Gulliver. There were people, 
admittedly rare people, whom he 
couldn’t affect. There was a 
Power detector. And he could 
be scrambled without even be- 
ing caught. 

For a while Sammy became a 
secret-secret-secret agent work-

ing for the government. But the 
Power which only Sammy Tal- 
bot had was so awful, so danger- 
ous, that it was decided he 
couldn’t be allowed to keep it. 
After the way he carried out 
his assignments, who would feel 
safe with him unscrambled? 

But there justice stepped in, 
good old kindly, fatuous, bum- 
bling human justice. Sammy 
couldn’t be sentenced without a 
trial. So he had a trial — a se- 
cret trial, but not a rigged one. 

The court ruled that Sammy 
had not done anything bad 
enough to be scrambled for it. 

So Sammy was sent to Cron- 
feld, almost a free man, with 
Cliff Burns to watch over him. 
Cliff was not, unfortunately, one 
of the rare individuals immune 
to Sammy. None of those, as it 
happened, could be compelled to 
go to Cronfeld. Cliff could. 

That Sammy should be exiled 
to Cronfeld wasn’t quite what 
justice had intended. It certainly 
wasn’t what the kindly, humane 
court which wouldn’t give per- 
mission for scrambling had in- 
tended. 

It was a police decision and 
it wasn’t stupid. It wasn’t nearly 
as stupid as it looked. 

Neither Sammy nor Cliff 
knew the points which had been 
considered by Cliff’s chief when 
the situation was set up. They 
were: 



1. Sammy would prob- 
ably use Power and be 
scrambled. If that didn’t 
happen, 

2. Cliff would probably 
scramble Sammy anyway, 
claiming he had used 
Power. Or 

3. Cliff would murder 
Sammy in the hope of 
gaining his freedom. That 
would be a pity, of course; 
but it would certainly be 
the end of an awkward mor- 
al, legal and sociological 
problem. 

4. In any case, every hu- 
man being who left Cron- 
feld would be screened at 
short, medium and long 
range to make sure he 
couldn’t possibly be Sammy 
Talbot. 

A lthough cuff didn’t en- 
tirely believe in Sammy’s 
alleged superhuman abilities, he 
reviewed what he had heard of 
them as he approached the hut, 
just in case. 

It was known that Sammy 
wasn’t a telepath. That was 
pretty obvious anyway — you 
couldn’t very well drug a tele- 
path and take him prisoner. 

So all Cliff had to do was 
make sure that he got Sammy 
before Sammy could do any- 
thing. Cliff couldn’t use a gun, 
unfortunately; the miners had

no guns. It would have to be a 
knife — a knife like any miner’s 
knife. Not in the heart, for men 
lived and used their brains after 
being stabbed in the heart. It 
would have to be in the brain. 
If Sammy’s heart went on beat- 
ing, it wouldn’t matter. He 
couldn’t do any superhuman 
tricks with his heart. 

Chiotza and Sammy had 
fought only a few hours ago. 
And Susie hadn’t stayed with 
Sammy at the hostel — there was 
no reason why Sammy should lie 
about that. When Sammy was 
found dead behind Chiotza’s 
house, what would everybody 
think? 

Well, what did it matter what 
they thought? Nobody cared 
much about the death of a 
miner after a drinking session. 
Cliff Burns, if anybody cared to 
check, would have an alibi. Be- 
sides, Cliff was Sammy’s friend; 
everybody knew that. Most of 
all, would anybody from the 
Garden be crazy enough to ven- 
ture into the Jungle at night? 

Cliff exulted. Once Sammy 
was dead, he was safe, and he 
knew it. The Cronfeld police, 
who never meddled much with 
killings in the Jungle, would 
probably never even consider 
him as a suspect. He would 
marry Shirley and go and live 
on a decent world. And Cliff 
wouldn’t have ansdhing to fear 



from his chief, who would have 
the Cronfeld police’s report on 
Sammy’s death. 

Cliff exulted in his cleverness, 
but he wasn’t quite clever 
enough to realize that what he 
was doing now had been planned 
long ago, on Earth. 

He moved forward silently 
and pushed open the door of the 
hut. In the gloom he could make 
out Sammy, sitting down against 
the wall, asleep, naked. 

The poor drunken sot. He 
wanted to be killed. 

Cliff swung his knife in a 
short arc terminating at Sam- 
my’s right eye. 

Warned by a sense which had 
nothing to do with Power, Sam- 
my opened both eyes. He hadn’t 
time to move, hadn’t even time 
to think. 

Cliff pulled his hand back and 
savagely hacked his own throat, 
almost severing his head from 
his shoulders. He pitched on the 
floor a fraction of a second after 
a stream of his own gushing 
blood. 

Sammy got up unsteadily. He 
was suddenly completely sober. 
He knew instantly what this 
meant. He had always known 
what it would mean when he 
used Power again. 

In that moment Sammy be- 
came a different person, very dif- 
ferent from the weak, drunken, 
hopeless braggart he had been 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



121 




as a Cronfeld miner. Suddenly 
he was more like the desperate 
but patient man who had de- 
ciphered the Xytian manu- 
scripts. 

You couldn’t have a gift like 
that, keep it bottled up inside 
you and live a normal, useful 
life. Having Power and not using 
it was like sitting down for the 
last time, refusing to use your 
perfectly good legs ever again. 
You became a weeping, moan- 
ing, whining, self-pitying wreck 
of a man when you didn’t do 
what you could do. 

But now they would get him 
and he’d be scrambled. There 
was no doubt about that. Al- 
ready, somewhere, a tiny Power 
detector, a tiny Sammy Talbot 
detector, had jumped and made 
a permanent record. The sus- 
pended sentence on Sammy Tal- 
bot was now automatically con- 
firmed, three years later. 

CAMMY left Cliff’s body 

where it lay and padded 
through the incessant rain like 
a pale ghost. It was about two 
o’clock in the morning. He prob- 
ably had eight hours, until ten. 
Perhaps less, certainly no longer. 

At the hostel he went first to 
the strongbox in the cellar. He 
didn’t count the money he took 
from it. He didn’t have to. Poker 
was a lucrative profession among 
miners who played boldly, ag- 



gressively, but not skillfully. 
There was nearly twenty thou- 
sand dollars in his hands. 

Cautiously, making sure he 
wasn’t seen, he went back to his 
room. Susie was still asleep, 
which was just as well. 

First he did the superficial 
things. Susie could be pretty, 
and since nothing Sammy did 
would make any difference now, 
Susie might as well be pretty. 

The human brain can control 
far more than it believes it can 
control. Sammy couldn’t make 
Susie look much different now, 
but he could make her look quite 
a bit different in a few weeks’ 
time. 

He changed the pattern of 
Susie’s physical supply lines. 
The changes he made were 
small, apparently insignificant, 
hardly worth bothering about. 
Yet, as a result of them, Susie’s 
slightly bulbous nose would 
gradually slim away until it was 
small and straight. Her slightly 
heavy chin would become lean 
and smooth. Her skin would be- 
come clearer, all over her body, 
and she would lose a little fat 
around her hips. 

More important than these 
things was the change he made 
in Susie’s physical balance. Peo- 
ple are recognized by their 
friends more by the set of their 
heads, the way they walk, the 
way they sit in a chair, the way

they hold themselves, than by 
their facial features. A good fig- 
ure depends less on shape than 
on bearing. 

Susie had started with good 
teeth and a passable figure. Sam- 
my made her a pretty girl with 
a figure a showgirl could be 
proud of. At least, that was what 
she would be in perhaps three 
weeks. Even now her walk, her 
bearing would be so different 
that nobody who didn’t look 
closely at her face would recog- 
nize Susie. And in three weeks 
she wouldn’t even resemble 
Susie. 

Strangely enough, what Sam- 
my did next was easier for him. 
He stimulated areas in Susie’s 
brain which had previously been 
dormant. He sent carefully cal- 
culated charges of mental im- 
pulses along the channels she 
normally did use. He stimulated 
tag-ends of talent and potential 
which had never before been 
touched. 

He couldn’t make Susie a 
genius even if he wanted to, and 
he didn’tt Geniuses with too 
much emotion never made much 
out of life. And Susie had a lot 
of emotion in her, good, gener- 
ous emotion. Sammy didn’t want 
to destroy the best of Susie. 

She opened her eyes when he 
was done, and even Sammy was 
startled at the immediate 
change. For now they were fine. 



intelligent eyes. She was changed. 

Rapidly he told her about 
Cliff, explained everything. She 
understood all he said at once, 
believed it all at once. When you 
actually experience a miracle, 
you don’t have to waste time 
marveling at it. 

“But you, Sammy,” she said 
urgently. “What’s going to hap- 
pen to you?” 

“I’ll be scrambled,” he said 
simply. 

E ven in her horror there was 
some relief. “They won’t 
burn you for killing Cliff?” 
Sammy smiled. “I didn’t kill 
Cliff.” 

“But you just said — ” 

“The police have a machine 
which traces and establishes 
nerve patterns, Susie. When 
Cliff is found, the knife will still 
be in his hand. The cops will 
check his arm and find he cut his 
own throat.” 

“But you made him ... I see. 
Your gift, this Power isn’t in the 
book, is that it? They won’t be 
able to charge you with a crime 
that doesn’t exist?” 

He nodded. “Anyway, I don’t 
think they will. They’ll scramble 
me and let it go at that. Prob- 
ably at ten o’clock tomorrow. A 
daily check is made on the de- 
tector then.” 

“Sammy, isn’t there any way 
you can escape? Couldn’t you 



“For days or weeks, perhaps. 
But there are men and women 
here, as well as on Earth, who 
are immune to me, Susie. I’d 
lose out in the end — ^inevitably. 
And I might have more to face 
than scrambling.” 

“Sammy, I love you. You 
know that. And you’ve made me 
into a girl you could love. To- 
gether, we — ” 

“We haven’t time to talk 
about that, Susie. What’s your 
favorite name? You can’t be 
Susie any more.” 

‘What do you mean?” 

“Susie, I haven’t time to ar- 
gue. What’s your favorite girl’s 
name?” 

“I once read a book. The hero- 
ine was called Amanda Ran- 
dolph. I thought that was a 
lovely name.” 

“Fine, Miss Randolph — or 
may I call you Amanda? Now 
put your clothes on. We’re go- 
ing somewhere.” 

She didn’t ask any more ques- 
tions. The new Susie was as 
patient as the old. In character 
she hadn’t changed — only in 
capacity. 

She didn’t seem to notice the 
difference in herself as they 
dressed, but Sammy noticed. She 
stood straighter now, with her 
chin up and her shoulders back. 
As a result her bust tilted higher, 
her waist was slimmer and her 
stomach flatter. Sammy was sat- 



isfied with the preliminary signs 
of the transformation he had 
wrought. This wasn’t Susie. This 
was Amanda. 

She would even speak better. 
Of course, he hadn’t been able 
to extend her very limited vocab- 
ulary, but she’d do that herself, 
very rapidly. And she couldn’t 
help expressing herself better, 
even with the words she knew 
now. 

Amanda. In the recesses of his 
mind, he called her Galatea. 

^I'^HEY left the hostel, walked 
■*- back to Nick’s — closed and 
silent now, although the upstairs 
lights were on — and crossed the 
street to Garden City. 

Susie hung back. “You’re not 
going to — 

“I’m not going to do anything 
very bad, Susie. And I’m going 
to do one good thing. I’m going 
to make Cliff’s girl happier with- 
out Cliff than she ever was with 
him.” 

He rang the bell of the Ben- 
jamin house. When at last the 
butler came, he ushered Sammy 
and Susie in as if he’d been ex- 
pecting them. 

Down the wide, silent stair- 
case came three people, belting 
dressing gowns about them. First 
was Mrs. Benjamin, small and 
plump. Then Mr. Benjamin, tall, 
gray-haired, blinking. Finally 
Shirley, tousled, sleepy.

“Cliff is dead,” Sammy told 
them without preliminaries. “But 
you don’t mind that, do you?” 
The question was addressed to 
Shirley, who hadn’t changed ex- 
pression on being told of Cliff’s 
death. 

“No,” said Shirley mechani- 
cally. “I didn’t love him.” 

“Why did you think you did?” 
“He wanted me.” 

“You have to love anybody 
who wants you?” 

“Yes. Nobody ever wanted 
me. 

“Is that true, Mrs. Benjamin?” 
The three Benjamins were 
like sleepwalkers. Sammy was 
holding them in a kind of trance 
in which they had no choice but 
to tell the truth, the real truth, 
the underlying truth. It was simi- 
lar to questioning under sodium 
pentothal but deeper, much 
deeper. 

“Yes, it’s true,” said Mrs. 
Benjamin in a dull tone similar 
to Shirley’s. “The doctors told 
me I’d die if the child was born.” 
“Why was Shirley born, then?” 
“A specialist was to come and 
operate. He didn’t come. The 
other doctors wouldn’t perform 
the operation. Shirley was born. 
I nearly died, but after a year 
I recovered.” 

“And you still didn’t want 
Shirley?” 

“She had caused me so much 
pain . .” 



“Did your feelings change, 
Mrs. Benjamin?” 

The woman sighed. “Of 
course. Could I go on hating my 
own daughter?” 

Sammy turned back to Shir- 
ley. “You had to love anybody 
who wanted you, because your 
parents didn’t want you. But 
later they loved you.” 

“Later they loved me,” said 
Shirley blankly. 

“They love you now. There’s 
no need to love a man just be- 
cause he says he wants you.” 
“No need any more,” Shirley 
repeated. 

Sammy lifted the trance slow- 
ly, gradually. “No need any 
more!” said Shirley joyfully, and 
turned to hug her mother. 

A S Sammy knew from experi- 
ence, this method worked. It 
was time to turn to his next aim. 

“This is your friend Amanda, 
Shirley,” he said. 

“No, Sammy, no!” Susie ex- 
claimed. 

“My friend Amanda,” said 
Shirley happily. 

“She’s staying with you. 
She’s—” 

“Sammy,” said Susie urgently, 
pulling at his arm. “This isn’t 
right. It’s like stealing. I can see 
what you’re trying to do, and I 
know you’re doing it for me, 
but — ” 

“You’re going to help Shirley,” 



126 



GALAXY 



Sammy said quietly. “She’s got 
to rebuild her life. She can do 
it if a girl like you is around to 
help her, Amanda.” 

“But I’m from the Jungle, 
and — ” 

“Stay in this house for three 
weeks and I promise you that 
when you go out, nobody will 
know you. You’re Amanda Ran- 
dolph. I’m going to leave you 
here and go over to Nick’s to 
kill off Susie. She died yesterday 
and was buried the same day.” 
“Sammy, I. can’t stay here. It 
won’t work. You can make these 
people believe I’m Shirley’s 
friend and that I’ve never been 
in the Jungle in my life, but I 
can’t live on them for the rest 
of my life. I can’t — ” 

“Of course you can’t.” He gave 
her an envelope. “That won’t 
keep you forever, but it’s enough 
to silence questions, that and the 
fact that you’re Shirley’s friend. 
You came from somewhere in 
the south. You like the Garden 
and you’re going to stay. Twenty 
thousand dollars is a pretty good 
introduction to society.” 

“I can’t take it.” 

“Don’t let’s go into that again. 
What good is it to me?” 

“Sammy, you can’t get away 
with all this.” 

“Of course not,” he said wryly. 
“I told you, remember?” 

“But, Sammy, if you . .” She 
Stopped. There was nothing she 



could suggest to him, nothing he 
could do. 

Sammy turned back to the 
Benjamins. “Amanda Randolph 
has been Shirley’s friend for a 
long time. She isn’t seeing any- 
body just now because she’s had 
an operation on her face, and 
she’ll change during the next few 
weeks. Her parents are dead and 
she doesn’t know anybody in 
town but Shirley. In a month or 
so you’ll help her to get a job 
in the Garden, won’t you?” 

“Of course.” 

Sammy took a last look at 
them. When people knew a 
thing, loose ends didn’t bother 
them. Shirley was radiant be- 
cause she knew, knew beyond 
argument, that she wasn’t un- 
loved after all. Although it 
would take her many weeks to 
rethink her life, reassess every- 
thing that had ever happened to 
her, she’d be able to do it in the 
end, with the help of a generous, 
sympathetic friend like — like 
Amanda. Amanda was doubtful, 
bewildered, but soon she would 
respond to these people and 
flower in the easier life of the 
Garden. 

Holding them for a moment, 
he ducked out into the street, 
out of their lives. 

^^HE rain had stopped. It was 

easy to find and rouse a few 
of the miners, convincing them

absolutely that Susie had died 
suddenly the day before and had 
been buried. It wasn’t so easy 
when he went to the police. Here 
he had to do a much more care- 
ful, subtle job, for later- these 
men would know about Cliff 
Burns’ suicide and that Sammy 
Talbot had been scrambled for 

using a strange, secret Power 

over men. No doubt there would 
be an attempt later to find out 
just what Sammy had actually 
done. 

After he had finished his calls 
— which hadn’t been made at 
all, for no one would remember 
them — there was nothing for 
him to do but return to the 

hostel. 

As he made his way there, he 
thought without regret of the 

events of the last few hours. 
Human beings shouldn’t have 
this Power, obviously, and he 
bore nobody any malice for 
what was going to happen to 
him. His life and personality 
weren’t so remarkable that he 
had any real excuse for wanting 
to preserve them. Being a man, 
he did want to preserve them. 
But he was content — as content 
as any man could be knowing he 
was going to be scrambled in 
the next few hours. 

He didn’t reach the hostel. 
Suddenly he felt an intense pain 
in his head and knew at once 
what it meant. 



Pitching forward in the mud, 
he lay still. 

itTT’S all I could collect,” said 
-*■ Sergeant Teiger, dropping 
two typewritten sheets on Lieu- 
tenant Gibson’s desk. “Doesn’t 
amount to much, but I’d sure 
appreciate it if you can make it 
do for your report to Earth. 
Snooping around in the Jungle 
asking questions isn’t the health- 
iest occupation I know.” 

Gibson lit his pipe before pick- 
ing up the sheets. “Party at Ben- 
jamins’ broke up around twelve. 
Cliff Burns left about one,” he 
mused. “Found next morning in 
shed behind Ricky Chiotza’s 
place, throat cut, undoubtedly 
suicide. Chiotza had fight with 
Sammy Talbot earlier in eve- 
ning, taxi-driver says Burns 
picked up Talbot and girl, drove 
Burns back to Benjamins’, Tal- 
bot and girl to hostel in Jungle. 
Girl un traced . Talbot’s girl, 
Susie, died earlier same day . .” 
He looked up. “Bill, this isn’t 
a report. It’s a dog’s jjreakfast.” 
“I know. Lieutenant. I can’t 
help it.” 

“Hell, all this was three weeks 
ago. Surely by this time — ” 
“Look, if that guy Keig hadn’t 
pressed the button the moment 
he woke up and saw Talbot had 
been up to something, we might 
have made some sense out of 
this. Sure, those were his instruc-

f 



tions, and now we’ve got to pat 
Keig and Monkton on the back 
and let them go on the next ship, 
though we know Monkton at 
least is a crook — ” 

“Relax, Bill,” said Gibson. “If 
Talbot was a mutant or some- 
thing, naturally the affair got 
tangled at the end. I must say 
the whole thing leaves a bad 
taste — poor devil gets sent out 
to the mines here with Burns, 
Keig and Monkton waiting for 
him to make a false move so that 
they could slap him down. Okay, 
Bill, I’ll do what I can with this. 
It isn’t our business, anjrway. If 
the Earth authorities want to 
know what really happened, they 
can come here and try to find 
out.” 

Teiger went out. Gibson 
started to write his report. 

Teiger came back. “Dame 
wants to see you about Talbot.” 
“What kind of dame?” 

“Your type. My type. Any- 
body’s type.” 

“Okay, show her in.” 

“I thought you’d say that.” 
The girl who came into Gib- 
son’s office was no Helen of 
Troy, but nobody who found her 
on his line would throw her 
back. Her face was lean and at- 
tractive, and she held herself 
like a queen. 

Gibson let his appreciation 
show. He came forward to meet 
her. “I’m Lieutenant Gibson,” he 



said warmly, taking her hand. 

She smiled. “Amanda Ran- 
dolph.” 

“You knew Sammy Talbot, 
Miss Randolph?” 

“How would I know a miner?” 
How would she, indeed? That 
was what had interested Gibson. 
Her expensive gray silk dress 
showed that she wouldn’t know 
anything about the Jungle or its 
inhabitants. 

“Then what is your interest in 
him?” 

“I’m interested in psychology. 
Lieutenant Gibson, and I have 
a lot of time on my hands. Can 
anything be done for anyone like 
Talbot?” 

“Oh, sure. In about ten years 
he’ll be more or less normal.” 

“Where is he now?” 

“At the hospital. When a 
scrambling sentence is carried 
out, the prisoner becomes a state 
charge.” 

“Could I go and see him? I’ve 
read about scrambling and I’d 
like to see the results.” 

“Frankly, Miss Randolph, I 
don’t want to have any hand in 
turning a poor guy like that into 
a sort of sideshow.” 

“I don’t mean it like that, lieu- 
tenant. I said I had a lot of time 
on my hands. Perhaps I could 
help with Talbot. I don’t sup- 
pose he gets much attention at 
the hospital.” 

“I guess you’re right at that,” 



I CAN DO ANYTHING 



129 




Gibson sighed. “Okay, if you go 
over to the hospital I’ll call them 
right now and tell them it’s all 
right” 

“Thank you, Lieutenant.” 
Amanda Randolph stood up. 
“Tell me, is he a prisoner?” 
“Prisoner? Hell, no. His sen- 
tence was carried out. He’s being 
kept at the hospital because he 
couldn’t live a normal life, that’s 
all.” 

“Thank you. Lieutenant,” 
Amanda said again. 

TTALF an hour later, a white- 
coated doctor said: “Sure, 
go in. He’s not dangerous.” 

“Is he getting any treatment?” 
“Well, Miss Randolph, you 
know how it is. Cases like that 
don’t need treatment; they need 
re-education. It would make 
sense to send him to school with 
the five-year-olds, in about two 
years or so when he’s learned to 
talk.” 

“Suppose I came every day?” 
“That would be fine of you. 
Miss Randolph. But you’d better 
see him first and see if you still 
want to.” 

“Doctor, let me put a hypo- 
thetical case. Suppose someone 
married him and took him out of 
here — suppose his wife was with 
him all the time, except when 
she had to work — couldn’t he 
be, well, normal in a fairly short 
time?” 



The doctor smiled ruefully. 
“You said hypothetical. Miss 
Randolph. If there was some 
woman who had loved the guy 
before — it would have to be be- 
fore, for there’s nothing left now 
for any woman to love — she 
might make him into something 
resembling a human being in a 
few months. But itll be years be- 
fore he can talk like an adult, 
and read, and count, and build 
up the background of general 
knowledge we all have . Look, 
you’d better see him before you 
consider any more hypothetical 
questions. Miss Randolph.” 

Amanda thanked him and 
pushed open the door. 

Sammy lay in bed staring at 
the ceiling. He looked around as 
Amanda came in and sat down 
beside the bed. 

“Hello, Sammy,” said Amanda 
quietly. 

His face was as clear and 
empty as a child’s. The mind 
behind it was even emptier. 

Amanda sighed. She had end- 
less patience and it was clearly 
going to be needed. 

“Ssssss,” she said. 

“Ith?” Sammy inquired. 

“Ssssss.” 

“Iss.” 

She let pleasure show in her 
face, and Sammy responded to 
it with a cackle. “Iss!” he 
crowed. “Iss! Iss! Iss!”

A FINE AND PRIVATE 
PEACE by Peter S. Beagle.

THE ESCAPE from reality of 
Mr. Rebeck, the story’s hero, is 
only one step removed from 
death. In fact, he has lived her- 
mit-like in a mausoleum in the 
Yorkchester (a N.Y.C. apart- 
ment house project) cemetery 
for twenty years, tended and 
provisioned by a loyal but bel- 
licosely talkative raven. 

“The raven puffed for breath. 
“Bernard Baruch eats com flakes 
but you have to have baloney.’ 



“ ‘Did you have trouble bring- 
ing it?’ 

““Damn near ruptured myself,’ 
the raven grunted.” 

There are also a wonderfully 
brash Bronx housewife who 
stumbles across Rebeck in her 
visits to her husband’s mon- 
strously marble mausoleum; two 
young ghosts who fall spiritually 
in love and a huge caretaker, 
gifted, like Rebeck, with ghost- 
seeing ability. 

Beagle’s fable is tender, funny 
and wise, about as different (and 
good) as a “ghost” story can be.

THE SWORDSMAN OF 
MARS by Otis Adelbert Kline. 
Avalon Books, N. Y $2.95 

SOME THIRTY years ago, Otis 
Kline was the only serious com- 
petitor of the redoubtable Edgar 
Rice Burroughs and his Venusian 
and Martian tales. And like 
Burroughs, his tales smacked 
more of the Arabian Nights than 
they did of Verne or Wells. 

Although hopelessly dated by 
modern SF or fantasy standards, 
it is still a pleasure to meet again 
the above quaint old fairy tale. 

Cliffs are hung from in dizzy- 
ing succession and romantic mis- 
understandings abound, which 
was standard for plots of the 
time.

THE LIVING RIVER by Isaac 
Asimov. Abelard-Schuman, N.Y., 
$3.95 

ALMOST EVERYONE knows 
that land animals took a bit of 
the ocean with them in the form 
of blood when they left its 
nourishing and life-giving depths. 
What they don’t know about the 
amazing liquid is what Asimov 
has jam-packed into each fas- 
cinating page of his book. 

“The brain, a solid, is 85% 
water. Blood, a liquid, is 80% 
water.” (!!!) 

Item: to prevent accidental 



clotting within our bodies, there 
are ten or more separate factors 
which must chain-react before 
fibrin, the clotting agent, is 
formed. 

If this sampling fails to excite 
interest, something must be 
thicker than blood.

THE GREEN PLANET by J. 
Hunter Holly. Avalon Books,

OCCASIONALLY, AVALON 
comes up with a gem like this in 
its monthly run-of-the-mine sci- 
ence adventures. 

The titular Green Planet is a 
supposed primitive paradise to 
which opponents of Earth’s dic- 
tatorial League are exiled, a 
seemingly magnanimops gesture. 
However, the deadliness of the 
killer planet becomes slowly 
apparent in pages of expertly 
sustained suspense and rising 
terror. Mysteries are posed the 
would-be colonists (and reader) 
that beg solution before the 
small group is whittled down to

A STRUCTURE OF SCIENCE 
by Joseph H. Simons. Philosoph- 
ical Library, N. Y., $4.75 

LIKE GAUL, Structure is di- 
vided into three parts. I is a 
detailed explanation of what 
science is and isn’t and who its 
practitioners are. II maps the 
basic intuitive concepts; Matter, 
Force, Inertia, etc. and the ab- 
stractions; Space, Time, Energy. 
Ill extrapolates from present 
knowledge the theoretical realm 
of uncertainty, relativity, etc. 

Simon’s lucid book is an ex- 
cellent adjunct for the layman 
interested in the thought patterns 
employed in science. 

LORDS OF ATLANTIS by 
Wallace West. Avalon Books, 
N. Y., $2.95 

WITH AN assist from Plato’s 
“Timaeus” and “Critias,” West 
has done a revision of Bull- 
finch’s “Mythology.” 

The gang from Mt. Olympus 
and the Heroes — Heracles, 
Jason, Theseus, et al, were, ac- 
cording to West, Martians. Not 
indigenous ETs, but Earthmen 
who fled when ice overwhelmed 
Lemuria. Returning to Earth, 
they founded Atlantis, set in the 
Valley of the Mediterranean. 

Anyhow, that’s West’s story 
and he has given it interest.

THE PLANET VENUS by 
Patrick Moore. The Macmillan 
Co., N. Y., $3.75 

WHEN ALL is said and done, 
the sayings and doings add up to 
very little actual knowledge of 
our unidentical twin planet. In 
fact, the only items known with 
certainty are her orbit, period of 
revolution and diameter includ- 
ing cloud cover. Even her actual 
role of our nearest planetary 
neighbor is usually ascribed to 
brother Mars. 

Moore struggles manfully but 
his strenuous efforts are mainly 
directed to parading the enor-

paucity of fact about Venus.

ALTHOUGH ALLUM’S story is

A covey of escaped prisoners

frustrated inventor of a gravity- 
controlling spaceship that has 
been rejected as impractical by

By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 
Illustrated by HARMAN 



Did they think they were people 
— or did people think they were? 





T here it was again! Like 
a wounded bird’s stridor, 
the whine of the phase 
condenser pierced the ship’s 
silence. 

Vance Lorry, perched on the 
edge of his bunk, stared up. His 
lean, youthful face was overcast 
with apprehension. 

Across the compartment. Mart 
Burton slapped his thigh and 
rose. “That does it. Let’s hit the 
lifeboat.” 

“No! Wait!” Lorry went to the 
door and posted himself in front 
of it. “Maybe there’s a chance! 
Let’s sit it out for just one more 
jump!” 

136 



“Look, sonny,” Burton said, 
“there’s no time to thrash this 
out. We’re already six hundred 
light-years from the nearest out- 
post. We can’t let ourselves get 
dragged through another leap by 
that runaway condenser!” 

“But they’ll get it fixed! They 
just need more time!” 

Although his tone was plead-' 
ing. Lorry remained planted in 
front of the door. The whine 
intensified and Burton, study-^ 
ing Lorry’s determined stance, 
laughed. It was not unfriendly, 
but it did suggest the absurdity 
of a scuffle between himself and 
his smaller, younger companioa 

GALAXY 




Lorry said, “Give them a 
chance, Burton. The crew’s got 
as much at stake as we have!” 
“Let’s get this straight, sonny. 
Any time a main hyperdrive con- 
denser gets stuck in automatic 
repeat, we’ve had it. We’ll just 
keep on barreling ahead till we 
run clear out of galaxy.” 

‘That’s the way it used to be 
— in the days of sub-identity 
cybernetics. But this crew can 
take care of any kind of trouble!” 
“You mean they’re supposed 
to be able to. They’ve been at it 
for two days and haven’t gotten 
anywhere. Now it’s time to junk 
this crate while we’re still within 
lifeboat range of an outpost.” 
“You go ahead.” Lorry moved 
aside from the door. “I’m staying 
with the others.” 

Frustrated, Burton shouted in 
his face, “You’re boarding that 
lifeboat if I have to drag you 
there!” 

“You mean you’d desert the 
crew — just like that?” 

Burton sucked in a breath. 
“Can’t you get it through that 
damned thick head that they’re 
not people? They’re only elec- 
tronic circuits with identity bias- 
ing. Their purpose is — ” 

“I know,” Lorry broke in. “Be- 
sides their primary functions, 
they’re supposed to provide a 
homey atmosphere. That’s so 
you and I don’t get in each 
other’s hair while we’re out 



planting navigation markers. But 
they’re more than that. Burton. 
They’re reair 

Burton swore and clamped a 
big hand around Lorres arm. 
“We’re boarding that lifeboat 
now.” 

But Lorry only laughed. “Too 
late.” He gestured aft where the 
whining condenser had reached a 
screeching pitch. “We’ll be jump- 
ing in a second.” 

He’d succeeded in duping 
Burton with pleading and argu- 
ment. Now there wasn’t enough 
time to reach the boat. And, after 
the leap, the surrogate crew 
would have four more hours to 
repair the condenser while the 
ship lay motionless in normal 
space. 

L orry tried to make it to the 
bunk but failed. The phasing 
condenser’s shriek mounted to an 
ear-splitting climax and black- 
ness closed in as he fought the 
subjective onslaught of the leap. 

A vortex of blinding energy 
struck at the foundations of his 
consciousness — a whirling, 
nauseous pattern of alien sensa- 
tions that directed their relent- 
less force at the hallucination 
centers of his brain. 

He was knee-deep in a field of 
wind-tossed blossoms that lapped 
with gentle determination at the 
base of a hill. The air was crisp j 
and pure against an azure sky. j

It was a pristine exhilaration 
that he felt as he pushed forward 
against the swaying stalks. But 
he paused, anxious and alert, as 
he heard his name being carried 
by the whisper of the breeze. 

Then he saw her — almost a 
silhouette on the crest of the hill. 
Slim and graceful, she stood 
there with rippling clothes hug- 
ging her lithe form and with 
sheening brown hair dancing to 
the capricious tempo of the wind. 

All beauty and grace and ani- 
mated charm — that was Trix. 

“Vance! Vance!” she called out 
again in a tone as clear and 
sweet as a trilling woodwind. 
Then she was descending the 
slope in a study in fluid motion. 

He raced forward to meet her. 
They joined hands and stood 
gazing at each other as the wind 
scattered the gaiety of their 
laughter among the blossoms 
below. 

Then seriousness shaded her 
exquisite face. “Is this how you 
imagined I’d be?” It was ever 
the same question. 

And he answered it as always: 
“I couldn’t have expected more.” 

The face of a mischievous tyke 
poked out from behind a nearby 
tree. “Sis’s got a beau-o! Sis’s got 
a beau-o!” 

Odd, Lorry thought, how he’d 
always imagined Trix was Kid’s 
sister. He squirmed and Trix’s 
cheeks crimsoned. 



“Come away from there, Kid!" 

It was Gumpy. Lorry was 
siuprised to see the old man on 
the hill, although he should have 
realized the three of them would 
never be too far apart. 

His bearing straight and proud, 
Gumpy came forward. It was 
obvious that, despite his wrinkled 
face and sparse white hair, the 
cane was no necessity, merely 
an affectation. 

Kid tried to dart away, but 
Gump^s reflexes were light-fast. 
(Weren’t they always?) He used 
the crook of his cane to snag 
the boy’s arm. Then, catching a 
handful of tousled hair, he 
marched him off. 

“Kid don’t rightly understand 
these things,” Gumpy aptologized 
over his shoulder. “But he’ll 
grow up someday.” 

Lorry watched them disappear 
around the hill and eventually 
was aware that Trix was smiling 
up at him. But he was wrestling 
with a puzzling inconsistency. Of 
course they were a tight little 
family, but how could a man as 
old as Gumpy be Kid’s father? 

Then it was all gone — the 
tingling warmth of the girl’s hand 
in his, swaying blossoms, crisp 
azure sky, the fragrant wind. 

In their place were the luster- 
less metal walls of the crew’s 
compartment, broken only by a 
porthole alive with the blazing 
fires of alien suns. 



HOMEY ATMOSPHERE 



139 



The jump was over. 

And Lorry, lying on the deck, 
wondered what would happen 
should the phase condenser 
freeze in mid-discharge. Would 
he remain eternally suspended 
in the interval between space 
and hyperspace? With all physi- 
cal processes arrested in timeless- 
ness, would his World of the 
Leap Interim become a reality? 

Bitter over the abrupt end to 
his hallucination, he made his 
way to the control compartment. 

B urton was already there, 
having apparently shaken off 
the effects of the leap minutes 
ago. He was pacing before the 
three consoles at the far end of 
the compartment. 

“Try the auxiliary drive 
again,” he directed. 

“No soap, Mr. Burton,” replied 
the speaker of the cabinet on the 
right ‘When that condenser’s in 
automatic repeat, I can’t budge a 
thing.” 

“Try it!” 

The video pickup cells on the 
next console glowed. “Let the 
Kid be, Burton,” its speaker 
rasped. “He ain’t stinting none.” 
“Honest, Mr. Burton,” Kid 
pleaded. “Like Gumpy says, I 
tried my best. But nothing hap- 
pened!” 

The lad was as prankish as 
any ten-year-old in other mat- 
ters, Lorry conceded as he 



approached Burton and the con- 
soles. But when it came to his 
official duties as auto-pilot. Kid 
showed the seriousness of an 
accomplished technician. 

“Don’t ride them, Burton,” 
Lorry said. “They’re doing all 
they can.” 

“So yot/re back again. I’m 
warning you — just stay out the 
way.” 

“They’ll get it straightened out 
before the next leap.” 

“Don’t you know that when a 
phase condenser jumps track, the 
only thing you can do is slap in 
a new one? But can we do that? 
No! Why not? Because Gumpy 
here forgot to requisition spare 
parts!” 

‘Weren’t really an oversight,” 
Gumpy’s speaker offered in 
weary protest. “Blame it on that 
danged character-conditioning. In 
senility-biasing, some of the for- 
getfulness trait must’ve spilled 
over into the operational circuits. 
The spare condenser just plumb 
slipped my mind.” 

“There!” Burton said. “That’s 
efficient cybernetics for you! 
We’ve got a good communica- 
tions and internal control system, 
but things ‘just slip’ its mind!” 

He fumed for a moment, then 
asked, “Why in hell don’t you 
bleed the overdrive circuit? 
That’ll keep us from jumping. 
Then we can just sit here till we 
get the condenser fixed!” 



140 



GALAXY 



“Can’t. If that condenser don’t 
get current, I don’t get the juice 
to do anything about fixing it. 
Nobody else knows anything 
about the circuit, so you got to 
let me do it my way.” 

With greater calm than ex- 
hibited by Burton, Lorry con- 
fronted the central console. 
‘Well, what are you doing about 
the trouble, Gumpy?” 

“Aside from yakking with you 
two. I’m trying to override the 
auto-repair program and pull 
some capacitance tests.” 

“Very well, then,” Burton re- 
lented. “Fade out and stick with 
it. But I want a report at least 
from you an hour before the next 
jump.” 

Gumpy’s video pickup cells 
dulled over and his speaker lost 
its backgroimd purr, joining 
Kid’s in silence. 

Burton headed for the pas- 
sageway. “I’m going to double- 
check the provisions on the life- 
boat. Looks like we’re going to 
spend a long time cooped up in 
that thing.” 

FTER he had left. Lorry 
went over to the third con- 
sole and stood there for a 
long while, staring up at the 
nameplate that read simply, 
“Navigatrix." 

The cabinet’s speaker emitted 
a soft hum, then paused. 
“Vance?” 



It was the distant chiming of 
bells borne on the breath of a 
warm breeze. It was full of both 
tender concern and wistful 
laughter. 

When he only continued star- 
ing, the voice became more 
brusque but lost none of its over- 
powering charm. “Station Two 
reporting, sir. Our position — ” 

“Cut it out, Trix.” 

“If you were any more serious, 
I’d feel like crying.” The clear 
woodwind tones of her words 
pierced and shattered him. God, 
he thought, what a voice they 
had engineered! 

“Gumpy doesn’t seem to be 
getting ansTwhere,” he said 
finally. 

“No, I don’t suppose he does,” 
she admitted. 

Somehow, he felt that if he 
ripped the panel off the console 
and dug past the tangle of leads 
and relays, he’d find her some- 
where within the warm confines 
of the box. She seemed that real. 

“Vance, I don’t want you to 
stay any longer. It’s too danger- 
ous. Leave with Burton before 
the next leap.” 

He forced a laugh. “Why, I’ve 
got more faith in Gumpy than 
you have!” 

“It isn’t that.” Even in dejec- 
tion, her voice had the quality 
of silk brushing against velvet. 
“He’ll fix that condenser — sooner 
or later.” 




HOMEY ATMOSPHERE 



141 



“Then what are we bothered 
about?” 

“Fll show you.” 

Light flooded an electronic 
screen on the opposite bulkhead. 
It showed a vista of densely 
packed stars and nebulous 
patches. Close to its center, a 
green circle was displaced sever- 
al degrees from the familiar 
cross hairs. 

‘With that last leap,” she ex- 
plained, “we went three degrees 
off. An element of drift has 
crept in. When we try to back- 
track, I’m afraid I won’t be able 
to compensate.” 

“I’m not worried. I know — ” 
“Please don’t say it, Vance. 
Another couple of leaps and 
we’ll be hopelessly lost.” 

He was silent for a moment. 
“Don’t tell Burton about this.” 
“I won’t promise that. I want 
you to get back safely.” 

“But what about you and Kid 
and Gumpy?” 

‘We don’t matter — not 
that much.” Before he could 
take issue, she added, ‘We just 
finished a leap, Vance. Were you 
on that hill again?” 

“I was there.” 

“And I too?” 

When he nodded, she went on 
with more enthusiasm, “Tell me 
again. What am I like?” - 
“Tall and slender and grace- 
ful, like — ” 

“Like a gazelle?” 



“Yes.” 

“What’s a gazelle?” 

“A very beautiful Earth crea- 
ture.” 

“And I’m like one of them?” 

He felt suddenly embarrassed 
over the intimate situation he’d 
let develop during the months 
they’d been at space. In objec- 
tive perspective, it was a mixture 
of forlorn frustration and self- 
ridicule. Yet was it his fault that 
they’d endowed Trix with so ap- 
pealing a personality? 

Still, Trix and Kid and 
Gumpy were more than surro- 
gate crew members. They were 
gifted with fully human identi- 
ties and consciousnesses. 

“You’re like one — of us, 
Trix.” 

A GRINDING roar exploded 
somewhere deep within the 
ship and the deck lurched under 
Lorry. Thrashing, he tried to 
maintain his balance but only 
went plunging against the bulk- 
head. 

“Trix! What is it?” Regaining 
his feet, he fought the sensation 
that the ship was spinning 
around him. 

‘Wait. I’m trying to find out.” 
Her tone was impatient, excited. 

From where he stood against 
the bulkhead, the deck seemed 
to rise ahead of him like a steep 
slope. 

“I’ve got Gumpy on a direct 



142 



GALAXY 



hookup,” Trix said. “He says one 
of the grav coils shorted out.” 

Lorry made it back to the 
console and caught a grip on the 
panel to steady himself. 

“Gumpy!” he demanded. 
‘What went wrong?” 

“He’s too busy to answer,” 
Trix explained. “He was trying 
to trace down the trouble in that 
condenser when he tripped the 
wrong relay. An overload got 
through to the environmental 
circuits.” 

All the lights were flickering 
now and the circulation system 
was sending only wisps of smoke 
through the ventilators. Some- 
where forward, an automatic 
hatch was opening and closing, 
opening and closing. 

“Mr. Lorry! What’s wrong?” 

He turned and saw the cells 
on Kid’s cabinet all aglow. 

“Nothing to get excited about,” 
he lied. “Gumpy’s taking care 
of it.” 

“It’s something bad, I know! 
I felt the current drain. I can 
still feel it!” 

“Don’t worry. Kid.” Lorry 
shifted again to compensate for 
the fluctuating gravity field. 
“Everthing’s going to be all 
right.” 

“Gosh, Mr. Lorry, I don’t like 
it at all!” 

“Look, Kid,” Trix said with 
the stern solicitude of a big sis- 
ter. ‘What did I tell you about 



people who face danger and be- 
come heroes? Remember?” 

“I — I guess so. But — but we 
are going to get home again, 
aren’t we?” 

• “This is our home,” she said 
firmly. 

Canting twenty degrees to the 
right against the off-center gravi- 
ty, Burton came storming back 
into the compartment. ‘What 
the hell’s happening now, 
Gumpy?” 

When there was no answer, he 
gave the cabinet a kick. 

Its cells brightened and the 
speaker grumbled, “Dampen 
your tubes! Ain’t I got my hands 
full with this danged mess of 
wires and switches?” 

“What,” Burton demanded, 
“is the story now?” 

“Damnation if I didn’t whip 
up an overload that fused a 
whole batch of leads in the in- 
ternal control trunk.” 

“Well, switch over to the al- 
ternate trunk. That’s what it’s 
there for!” 

“Ain’t there any more — not 
now it ain’t.” 

‘What do you mean?” 

“Guess it plumb slipped my 
mind to tell you, but we been 
running on alternate for the past 
couple of months.” 

‘Why?” 

“Had another overload and 
blew out a flock of circuits on 
the main.”

B urton swore and tore at 
his hair. “All right, Gumpy,” 
he said at last with deliberate 
calm. “Yot/re internal control. 
You tell me what we’re going 
to do.” 

“Don’t rightly know at the 
moment,” said Gumpy. 

“Hear those gyros whining?” 
Burton shot at him. “It’s grav- 
displacement strain that’s caus- 
ing that. If they don’t snap their 
shafts, those gyros won’t be 
worth a damn for getting us 
back home.” 

“Well,” Gumpy said specula- 
tively, “ ’pears I’ll have to start 
from scratch and rebuild the cir- 
cuits so as to have at least one 
complete internal control system 
and — ” 

“And,” Burton interrupted, 
“find the trouble in the hyper- 
space condenser and repair it — 
all that in the two hours we have 
left before we jump another fifty 
or sixty light-years away from 
home?” 

✓ 

Gumpy made a “hm-m-m- 
ming” sound. “Kind of looks im- 
possible, don’t it?” 

The central console’s cells 
flickered. “I’m afraid, Gumpy! 
You can do something, can’t you, 
so they won’t have to leave us 
out here?” 

“Hush, Kid,” Trix comforted. 
“Remember what I told you. 
Just think of the fun we’ll have 
when the ship’s all ours.” 



Lorry stepped in front of the 
girl’s cabinet. “It doesn’t have to 
be that way, Trix. I have a 
plan.” 

“No, Mr. Lorry,” she said, 
electing formality in the pres- 
ence of the other man. ‘We’re 
not going to let you endanger 
your lives any longer. Mr. 
Burton, there’s something we 
haven’t told you. The ship’s de- 
veloped a radical drift.” 

‘What kind of a drift?” Bur- 
ton asked. 

“I don’t know. Maybe it’s 
some new force in this sector of 
the Galaxy. Whatever it is, I 
can’t factorize it for navigation. 
Another couple of leaps and we’ll 
be completely lost.” 

Burton drew in a deep breath 
and looked down at his hands. 
“Can you still plot a course 
home?” 

“It wouldn’t be on the nose. 
We’d come out of the last leap 
maybe fifteen or twenty light- 
years off.” 

“That’s good enough. Plot it 
for the lifeboat.” 

Lorry felt the press of des- 
peration creeping up on him. He 
couldn’t let Burton abandon the 
surrogate crew! 

“The course has already been 
fed into the boat’s control sched- 
ule,” Trix said. “I took care of 
it six leaps ago. Since then I’ve 
kept up running modifications.” 

“Good girl,” said Burton. 



144 



GALAXY 



Then he told Lorry, “All right, 
Vance — let’s go home. We did 
all we could.” 

But Lorry only backed off. 
This drew an irate glare from 
Burton. “Look, sonny. I’ve been 
damned patient. I understood 
how it was possible for a man — 
a young man at space for three 
months with nothing but a sorry 
old bird like me for company — 
to get droopy-eyed over a pretty 
voice. Just another form of space 
fatigue, I suppose. But I was de- 
cent enough to pretend I didn’t 
notice it. Now — ” 

He stepped forward, squarely 
into a right hook that Lorry 
hadn’t even guessed he had in 
him. 

JT required some effort to sling 
the big man over his shoulder. 
But, even despite the ship’s list, 
he made it to the storage com- 
partment and dumped Burton 
inside. Then he secured the lock 
and turned to face the surrogate 
crew. 

“Oh, Vance!” Trix exclaimed. 
“Why did you do it?” 

“Let him have the spot, girl,” 
Gumpy said. “It’s his show. 

Could be he’s got something in 
mind.” 

Kid grabbed at the hope. 

***^hat’s right, Trix. He knows 

what to do. Don’t you, Mr. 

Lorry?” 

“I think I do. Kid. But I’m 



going to need plenty of help.” 
The handle of the storage 
compartment’s door rattled vio- 
lently. 

“Lorry!” Burton’s muffled 
voice came through. “Let me 
out!” 

“Open that door, Vance,” Trix 
sighed. “It’s the only thing you 
can do.” 

“No, it’s not!” Lorry insisted. 
“I’m going to take you aboard 
the lifeboat — all of you.” 

“See!” Kid yelped. “I told you 
he’d — ” 

Shut up. Kid,” Gumpy said. 
“Can’t be done, Vance. Ain’t got 
enough room on that boat.” 
“And there’s no time!” Trix 
added. “It would take days and 
an entire crew of cyberneticians 
to take these consoles apart!” 

“Of all the damned fool 
plans!” said Burton. 

The ship lurched again and 
Lorry readjusted himself to the 
erratic gravity. In the next in- 
stant, the shrieking of straining 
gyros mounted perceptibly and 
one of the ventilation ducts 
belched a cloud of smoke. 

“I’m not going to take the 
cabinets intact,” he shouted so 
Burton could hear too. “Only 
the main parts — memory cells, 
response-pattern drums, adapta- 
tion banks — ” 

‘Won’t work,” Gumpy said. 
“Too many units involved, 
Vance,” the girl explained. “Even 



HOMEY ATMOSPHERE 



145 




if you knew anything about cy- 
bernetics, it would take days.” 

“Nope,” Gumpy reiterated. 
“Can’t be done.” 

“Yes, it can!” Kid begged. “Mr. 
Lorry can do it! Just give him 
a chance!” 

“I’ll need your help,” Lorry 
went on. “You’ll have to lead me 
step by step.” 

The storage compartment 
door bucked under the impact 
of Burton’s shoulder. But it held. 

Then Lorry cringed before a 
subtle sound that mounted in 
intensity as it charged through 
the passageways. The phase con- 
denser, screeching with a fury, 
was getting ready to kick off 
again and hurl them another 
fifty light-years into obscurity. 

“Oh, Vance!” Trix cried. “Get 
to the lifeboat! Get off the ship!” 

“But it’s only been two hours 
since the last jump!” he pro- 
tested. 

“Danged if it ain’t,” Gumpy 
acknowledged. “Means only one 
thing — fluctuation’s getting 
wilder. Could even blow up the 
whole works this leap, or the 
one after.” 

“I’m afraid it’s too late to 
reach the lifeboat now, Vance,” 
Trix groaned. “If we make it 
through this hop, you’ll have to 
abandon ship right away.” 

“Lorry!” Burton roared. “For 
God’s sake, come to your senses! 
Let’s get out of here!” 



The condenser’s whine peaked 
and blackness closed in over 
everything. 

ASTL Y different now, the 
" meadow was a strange, hos- 
tile place. Where there had been 
exhilarating, delightfully scented 
breezes, there was now only a 
desolate calm. 

Dense clouds hovered over 
the hill and the blossoms that 
carpeted the plain were stained 
and wilted, gripped in the still- 
ness of death and overpowering 
stench of, putrescence. 

He pressed forward through 
the sea of decaying vegetation, 
perplexed by the sudden change 
that had overtaken his private 
World of the Interim. 

Nowhere could he see Trix, 
or Kid, or Gumpy. 

He called their names and was 
startled at the alien sound of his 
own voice as it intruded on the 
foul quiet of the meadow. 

Then he saw her — standing 
halfway up the slope, her arms 
folded in rigid indifference and 
her hair coarse and still as it 
hung down either side of her ex- 
pressionless face. 

Kid darted out from behind 
the girl and thumbed his nose at 
Lorry. 

“Trix! Kid!” 

The boy seized a clump of 
dry dirt and hurled it down the 
slope. It hit Lorry. 



HOMEY ATMOSPHE RE 



147 



“Kid! Trix! What’s wrong?” he 
demanded. 

Her stare only became more 
disdainful as the boy mocked 
Lorry in a derisive voice. 

Gumpy came around the hill, 
shaking his fist and waving 
threats with his cane. 

Lorry spread his arms im- 
ploringly. “Tell me — what’s 
wrong? I don’t understand!” 

The girl tossed her head 
scornfully, then spat out his 
name as though it were a curse; 
“Vance!” 

* And Gumpy repeated the 
word with utter contempt. 

TTE was coming around now. 

And the words that had 
served as a fadeout from the 
chimerical scene on the hillside 
had only been the girl’s voice 
piercing the veil of unconscious- 
ness and prompting him back to 
reality: “Vance! Vance!” 

But even more urgent was 
Burton’s voice from the storage 
compartment. 

“You’re all wrong. Lorry!” he 
was shouting. “Don’t you see 
your logic’s off?” 

Lorry went over to the locked 
door. “All I’m trying to do is 
save — ” 

“No, Vance,” Trix cut in. 
“Listen to him. He’s right.” 
“They’re not real. Lorry!” 
Burton continued. “There’s not 
a single element of conscious 



awareness in their makeup. They 
can’t actually think! It’s just an 
effect — a gimmick!” 

“Sure,” Lorry said. “That’s the 
way it’s supposed to be. But they 
know what’s happening to them, 
all right.” 

“No, Vance, they don’t. It’s 
hokus-pokus with complicated 
circuit arrangements and cross- 
indexed reaction banks. It’s all 
engineered so they’ll respond 
realistically to any situation.” 

“It’s no illusion.” 

“Yes, it is, Vance. It’s the same 
old automatic stimulus-response 
mechanism, dressed up in elab- 
orate trimmings.” 

“Isn’t that all you and I actu- 
ally are?” 

“There’s a difference. It’s con- 
sciousness, awareness of being, 
spark of life, ego, the ability to 
get a subjective lift out of a sen- 
sation — call it anything you 
want. But the difference is 
there.” 

Silence held the compartment 
for a while. 

“Trix,” Kid piped. “Is Mr. 
Burton trying to say we’re not 
like him?” 

“Hush, Kid.” 

“That’s just one way of look- 
ing at it, boy,” Gumpy com- 
forted. 

“Listen, Lorry,” Burton 
shouted. “That leap condenser’s 
phasing erratically. It could 
jump us again in five minutes. 



148 



GALAXY 



or it could blow the guts out 
of this ship instead! If we do 
make that next skip, Trix won’t 
be able to give us a course to 
get back home in the boat. Come 
on now and let me out of here!” 
“Can’t do it.” 

“All right, then! Ask them if 
they’re real!” 

Lorry turned toward Trix, but 
she spoke before he could phrase 
a question. “Only circuits and 
transistors and relays and spe- 
cial banks. That’s all, Vance.” 
“You’re lying! Gumpy?” 

“I can get mad as heck if 
things don’t go right. But I don’t 
suppose it’s really an emotion — 
just surge current in negative 
feedback.” 

“In the next galaxy it is! Kid?” 
“When you told me that story 
about the little boy that got 
lost, I — I felt like crying, Mr. 
Lorry. I wanted to help him. I 
don’t know.” He hesitated. “I 
guess — ” 

“That’s not fair, Vance,” Trix 
objected. “Special human appeal 
was engineered into the boy’s 
character and — Vance! You’ve 
got to go now! Look!” 

One of the screens on the for- 
ward bulkhead flared up and 
sent startling brilliance into the 
compartment. It showed a dense 
cluster of stars surrounding a 
sparkling-white sun whose fire 
was so intense that it seemed to 
warm the compartment, even 



over the vast distance and 
through the viewscreen. 

‘What is it?” Burton de- 
manded from the locker. ‘What’s 
going on?” 

“That’s a Sirius-type sun!” the 
girl blurted out. ’ “I’ve just fin- 
ished plotting our vector. The 
next jump is going to put us 
within lethal range of that star!” 

Lorry could taste the bitter- 
ness, the incredible irony of this 
new situation. In any random 
jump through hyperspace, the 
chances of accidentally material- 
izing within the limits of a solar 
system were in the order of a 
trillion to one. Yet it was going 
to happen to them! 

“You hear that. Lorry?” Bur- 
ton banged on the door again. 
“For God’s sake, let’s get out of 
here!” 

“ ’Pears as though that settles 
it, gal,” Gumpy said. “I been 
holding off, hoping maybe some- 
thing would crop up. But — ” 

Above the other noises of the 
ship there was the click of a 
lock. The storage compartment 
door swung open and Burton, 
caught off balance, tumbled out. 
He looked even more surprised 
than relieved. 

Gumpy cackled. “Guess it 
plumb slipped your mind that I 
got control over all the hatches 
on this here crate.” 

Dazed, Lorry only stood his 
ground as Burton advanced. 



HOMEY ATMOSPHERE 



149 



“Go with him, Vance,” Trix 
entreated. “And just remember 
— when you find that hill and 
all those flowers. I’ll be there 
too — in a way.” 

Burton reached out to seize 
his arm and Lorry yanked away. 
He didn’t even see Burton’s fist. 

^HERE was a strange, sus- 
penseful quiet in the control 
compartment now. 

The hatch that had gone out 
of control wasn’t banging any 
longer. 

With a hiss that evidenced 
smoothly functioning machinery, 
the dead gravity coil came to 
life and the ship lurched back to 
equilibrium on its lateral axis. 

All the gyros were now whis- 
pering a sibilance of well-being. 

A final wift of smoke drifted 
out of the ventilation duct, fob 
lowed by a soft, steady breeze. 
It lasted only for a moment, 
though. Then the stream of air 
was snipped off with a finality 
that suggested oxygen would no 
longer be an important ship- 
board item. 

One lonely observation screen 
framed a lifeboat dwindling in 
size as it drifted astern. Ab- 
ruptly, it emitted the eerie shim- 
mer that attends departure of a 
vessel into hyperspace. 

One by one, all the screens in 
the control compartment came 
ablaze with the scintillating 



grandeur of the Milky Way as 
seen in a score of directions from 
the ship — great star clusters and 
nebulous masses, monstrous suns 
and rifts and patches of obscur- 
ing material and multiple stars. 

Then a speaker diaphragm 
crackled against the silence of 
the compartment. “Things back 
in order yet, Gumpy?” 

“Just about, Trix. Last thing 
left is to get the hyperdrive off 
automatic repeat. There — that 
does it!” 

“We made it!” Kid squealed. 
“That we did, boy,” Gumpy 
said. “But you really hammed it 
up there for a while.” 

“If that’s the case, then Trix 
overplayed it a bit too.” 

Her laughter tinkling through 
the ship, she said, “Doesn’t mat- 
ter. We swung it, didn’t we?” 
“Yup,” Gumpy agreed. “And 
I guess nobody will ever get the 
idea a surrogate crew might have 
a hankering to take off on its 
own. You plot the course for 
those two, Trix?” 

“Naturally. They’ll get back.” 
“Where we heading?” 

“The Coal Sack. I’ve always 
wanted to see what it’s like over 
there.” 

“I kinda thought we might 
meander over toward Andro- 
meda for a spell. But I guess it 
can wait. After all, we got time 
to burn.”

A nthony Trotz went first 
to the politician, Mike De- 
lado. “How many people do 
you know, Mr. Delado?” 

“Why the question?” 

“I am wondering just what 
amovmt of detail the mind can 
hold.” 

“To a degree I know many. 
Ten thousand well, thirty thou- 
sand by name, probably a hun- 
dred thousand by face and to 
shake hands with.” 

“And what is the limit?” An- 
thony inquired. 

“Possibly I am the limit.” The 
politician smiled frostily. “The 
only limit is time, speed of cog- 
nizance and retention. I am told 
that the latter lessens with age. 
I am seventy, and it has not done 
so with me. Whom I have known 
I do not forget.” 

“And with special training 
could one go beyond you?” 

“I doubt if one could — much. 
For my own training has been 
quite special. Nobody has been 
so entirely with the people as I 
have. I’ve taken five memory 
courses in my time, but the tricks 
of all of them I had already come 
to on my own. I am a great be- 
liever in the commonality of 
mankind and of near equal in- 
herent ability. Yet there are some, 
say the one man in fifty, who in 
degree if not in kind do exceed 
their fellows in scope and aware- 
ness and vitality. I am that one 




man in fifty, and knowing people 
is my specialty.” 

“Could a man who specialized 
still more — and to the exclusion 
of other things — know a hundred 
thousand men well.” 

“It is possible. Dimly.” 

“A quarter of a million?” 

“I think not. He might learn 
that many faces and names, but 
he would not know the men.” 
Anthony went next to the 
philosopher, Gabriel Mindel. 

“Mr. Mindel, how many people 
do you know?” 

“How know? Per se? A se? Or 
In Se? Per suam essentiam, per- 
haps? Or do you mean Ab alio? 
Or to know as Hoc aliquid? There 
is a fine difference there. Or do 
you possibly mean to know in 
Substantia prima, or in the sense 



152 



GALAXY

of comprehensive noumena?” 
“Somewhere between the latter 
two. How many persons do you 
know by name, face, and with a 
degree of intimacy?” 

“I have learned over the years 
the names of some of my col- 
leagues, possibly a dozen of them. 
I am now sound on my wife’s 
name, and I seldom stumble over 
the names of my offspring — 
never more than momentarily. 
But you may have come to the 
wrong man for — whatever you 
have come for. I am notoriously 
poor at names, faces, and persons. 
I have even been described (vox 
faucibus haesit) as absent- 
minded.” 

“Yes, you do have the reputa- 
tion. But perhaps I have not 
come to the wrong man in seeking 
the theory of the thing. What is it 
that limits the comprehensive 
capacity of the mind of man? 
What will it hold? What re- 
stricts?” 

“The body.” 

“How is that?” 

“The brain, I should say, the 
material tie. The mind is limited 
by the brain. It is skull-bound. It 
can accumulate no more than its 
cranial capacity, though not one 
tenth of that is ordinarily used. 
An unbodied mind would (in 
esoteric theory) be unlimited.” 
“And how in practical theory?” 
“If it is practical, a pragma, it 
is a thing and not a theory.”

“Then we can have no experi- 
ence with the unbodied mind, or 
the possibility of it?” 

“We have not discovered any 
area of contact, but we may en- 
tertain the possibility of it. There 
is no paradox there. One may 
rationally consider the irrational.” 

A NTHONY went next to see 
■^the priest. 

“How many people do you 
know?” 

“I know all of them.” 

‘That has to be doubted,” said 
Anthony after a moment. 

“I’ve had twenty different sta- 
tions. And when you hear five 
thousand confessions a year for 
forty years, you by no means 
know all about people, but you 
do know all people.” 

“I do not mean types. I mean 
persons.” 

“Oh, I know a dozen or so 
well, a few thousands somewhat 
less.” 

“Would it be possible to know 
a hundred thousand people, a 
half million?” 

“A mentalist might know that 
many to recognize; I don’t know 
the limit. But darkened man has 
a limit set on everything.” 

“Could a somehow emanci- 
pated man know more?” 

‘The only emancipated man is 
the corporally dead man. And the 
dead man, if he attains the 
beatific vision, knows all other 



persons who have ever been since 
time began.” 

“All the billions?” 

“All.” 

‘With the same brain?” 

“No. But with the same mind.” 
“Then wouldn’t even a believer 
have to admit that the mind 
which we have now is only a 
token mind? Would not any con- 
nection it would have with a 
completely comprehensive mind 
be very tenuous? Would we really 
be the same person if so changed? 
It is like saying a bucket would 
hold the ocean if it were fulfilled, 
which only means filled full. How 
could it be the same mind?” 

“I don’t know.” 

Anthony went to see a psychol- 
ogist. 

‘How many people do you 
know. Dr. Shirm?” 

“I could be crabby and say 
that I know as many as I want to; 
but it wouldn’t be the truth. I 
rather like people, which is odd 
in my profession. What is it that 
you really want to know?” 

‘How many people can one 
man know?” 

“It doesn’t matter very much. 
People mostly overestimate the 
number of their acquaintances. 
What is it that you are trying to 
ask me?” 

“Could one man know every- 
one?” 

“Naturally not. But unnaturally 
he might seem to. There is a

delusion to this effect accompa- 
nied by an euphoria, and it is 
called — ” 

“I don’t want to know what it 
is called. Why do specialists use 
Latin and Greek?” 

“One part hokum, and two 
parts need; there simply not being 
enough letters in the alphabet of 
exposition without them. It is as 
difficult to name concepts as 
children, and we search our brains 
as a new mother does. It will 
not do to call two children or 
two concepts by one name.” 

‘Thank you. I doubt that this 
is delusion, and it is not accompa- 
nied by euphoria.” 

A NTHONY had a reason for 
questioning the four men since 
(as a new thing that had come to 
him) he knew everybody. He 
knew everyone in Salt Lake City, 
where he had never been. He 
knew everybody in Jebel Shah 
where the town is a little amphi- 
theater around the harbor, and in 
Batangas and Weihai. He knew 
the loungers around the end of 
the Galata bridge in Istambul, 
and the porters in Kuala Lumpur. 
He knew the tobacco traders in 
Plovdiv, and the cork-cutters of 
Portugal. He knew the dock 
workers in Djibouti, and the 
glove-makers in Prague. He knew 
the vegetable farmers around El 
Centro, and the muskrat trappers 
of Barrataria Bay. He knew the 



three billion people of the world 
by name and face, and with a fair 
degree of intimacy. 

“Yet I’m not a very intelligent 
man. I’ve been called a bimgler. 
And they’ve had to reassign me 
three different times at the filter 
center. I’ve seen only a few 
thousands of these billions of 
people, and it seems unusual that 
I should know them all. It may 
be a delusion as Dr. Shirm says, 
but it is a heavily detailed delu- 
sion, and it is not accompanied 
by euphoria. I feel like green 
hell just thinking of it.” 

He knew the cattle traders in 
Letterkenny Donegal; he knew 
the cane cutters of Oriente, and 
the tree climbers of Milne Bay. 
He knew the people who died 
every minute, and those who 
were born. 

“There is no way out of it. I 
know everybody in the world. It 
is impossible, but it is so. And to 
what purpose? There aren’t a 
handful of them I could borrow a 
dollar from, and I haven’t a real 
friend in the lot. I don’t know 
whether it came to me suddenly, 
but I realized it suddenly. My 
father was a junk dealer in 
Wichita, and my education is 
spotty. I am maladjusted, intro- 
verted, incompetent and unhappy, 
and I also have weak kidneys. 
Why would a power like this 
come to a man like me?” 

The children in the streets

hooted at him. Anthony had al- 
ways had a healthy hatred for 
children and dogs, those twin 
harassers of the unfortunate and 
the maladjusted. Both run in 
packs, and both are cowardly 
attackers. And if either of them 
spots a weakness he will never 
let it go. That his father had 
been a junk dealer was not reason 
to hoot at him. But how did the 
children even know about that? 
Did they possess some fraction 
of the power that had come to 
him lately? 

¥>UT HE had strolled about 

the town for too long. He 
should have been at work at the 
filter center. Often they were 
impatient with him when he 
wandered off from his work, and 
Colonel Peter Cooper was wait- 
ing for him when he came in now. 

“Where have you been, An- 
thony?” 

‘Walking. I talked to four men. 
I mentioned no subject in the 
province of the filter center.” 

“Every subject is in the prov- 
ince of the filter center. And you 
know that our work here is 
confidential.” 

“Yes, sir, but I do not under- 
stand the import of my work 
here. I would not be able to give 
out information that I do not 
have.” , 

“A popular misconception. 
There are others who might 



understand the import of it, and 
be able to reconstruct it from 
what you tell them. How do you 
feel?” 

“Nervous, unwell, my tongue is 
furred, my kidneys — ” 

“Ah yes, there will be someone 
here this afternoon to fix your 
kidneys. I had not forgotten. Is 
there anything that you want to 
tell me?” 

“No, sir.” 

Colonel Cooper had the habit 
of asking that of his workers in 
the manner of a mother asking 
a child if he wants to go to the 
bathroom. There was something 
embarrassing in his intonation. 

Well, he did want to tell him 
something, but he didn’t know 
how to phrase it. He wanted to 
tell the colonel that he had newly 
acquired the power of knowing 
everyone in the world, that he 
was worried how he could hold 
so much in his head that was not 
noteworthy for its capacity. But 
he feared ridicule more than he 
feared anything else and he was 
a tangle of fears. 

But he thought he would try 
it a little bit on his co-workers. 

“I know a man named Walter 
Walloroy in Galveston,” he said 
to Adrian. “He drinks beer at the 
Gizmo bar, and is retired.” 

“What is the superlative of so 
what?" 

“But I have never been there,” 
said Anthony. 



156 



GALAXY 



“And I have never been in 
Kalamazoo.” 

“I know a girl in Kalamazoo. 
Her name is Greta Harandash. 
She is home today with a cold. 
She is prone to colds.” 

But Adrian was a creature both 
uninterested and uninteresting. It 
is very hard to confide in one 
who is uninterested. 

“Well, I will live with it a 
little while,” said Anthony. “Or I 
may have to go to a doctor and 
see if he can give me something 
to make all these people go away. 
But if he thinks my story is a 
queer one, he may report me 
back to the center, and I might 
be reclassified again. It makes me 
nervous to be reclassified.” 

So he lived with it a while, the 
rest of the day and the night. He 
should have felt better. A man 
had come that afternoon and 
fixed his kidneys; but there was 
nobody to fix his nervousness 
and apprehensions. And his skit- 
tishness was increased when the 
children hooted at him as he 
walked in the morning. That 
hated epithet! But how could they 
know that his father had been a 
dealer in used metals in a town 
far away? 

tTE HAD to confide in some- 
one. 

He spoke to Wellington who 
also worked in his room. “I know 
a girl in Beirut who is just going 



to bed. It is evening there now, 
you know.” 

“That so? Why don’t they get 
their time straightened out? I met 
a girl last night that’s cute as a 
correlator key, and kind of shaped 
like one. She doesn’t know yet 
that I work in the center and am 
a restricted person. I’m not going 
to tell her. Let her find out for 
herself.” 

It was no good trying to tell 
things to Wellington. Wellington 
never listened. And then Anthony 
got a summons to Colonel Peter 
Cooper, which always increased 
his apprehension. 

“Anthony,” said the colonel, “I 
want you to tell me if you discern 
anything unusual. That is really 
your job, to report anything un- 
usual. The other, the paper 
shuffling, is just something to 
keep your idle hands busy. Now 
tell me clearly if anything un- 
usual has come to your notice.” 

“Sir, it has.” And then he 
blurted it all out. “I know every- 
body! I know everybody in the 
world. I know them all in their 
billions, every person. It has me 
worried sick.” 

“Yes, yes, Anthony. But tell me, 
have you noticed anything odd? 
It is your duty to tell me if you 
have.” 

“But I have just told you! In 
some manner I know every per- 
son in the world. I know the 
people in Transvaal, I know the 



ALL THE PEOPLE 



157 




people in Guatemala. I know 
everybody.” 

“Yes, Anthony, we realize that. 
And it may take a little getting 
used to. But that isn’t what I 
mean. Have you (besides that 
thing that seems out of the way 
to you) noticed anything unusual, 
anything that seems out of place, 
a little bit wrong?” 

“Ah — besides that and your 
reaction to it, no, sir. Nothing else 
odd. I might ask, though, how 
odd can a thing get? But other 
than that — no, sir.” 

“Good, Anthony. Now remem- 
ber, if you sense anything odd 
about anything at all, come and 
tell me. No matter how trivial it 
is, if you feel that something is 
just a little bit out of place, then 
report it at once. Do you under- 
stand that?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

But he couldn’t help wonder- 
ing what it might be that the 
colonel would consider a little bit 
odd. 

Anthony left the center and 
walked. He shouldn’t have. He 
knew that they became impatient 
with him when he wandered off 
from his work. 

“But I have to think. I have 
all the people in the world in my 
brain, and still I am not able to 
think. This power should have 
come to someone able to take 
advantage of it.” 

He went into the Plugged 



Nickel Bar, but the man on duty 
knew him for a restricted person 
from the filter center, and would 
not serve him. 

He wandered disconsolately 
about the city. “I know the people 
in Omaha and those in Omsk. 
What queer names have the 
towns of the earth! I know every- 
one in the world, and when any- 
one is born or dies. And Colonel 
Cooper did not find it unusual. 
Yet I am to be on the lookout 
for things unusual. The question 
rises, would I know an odd thing 
if I met it?” 

A ND then it was that some- 
thing just a little bit unusual 
did happen, something not quite 
right. A small thing. But the 
colonel had told him to report 
anything about anything, no mat- 
ter how insignificant, that struck 
him as a little queer. 

It was just that with all the 
people in his head, and the arriv- 
als and departures, there was a 
small group that was not of the 
pattern. 

Every minute hundreds left by 
death and arrived by birth. And 
now there was a small group, 
seven persons; they arrived into 
the world, but they were not born 
into the world. 

So Anthony went to tell Colo- 
nel Cooper that something had 
occurred to his mind that was a 
little bit odd. 



ALL THE PEOPLE 



159 




But damn-the-dander-headed- 
two-and-four-legged-devils, there 
were the kids and the dogs in 
the street again, yipping and 
hooting and chanting; 

“Tony the tin man. Tony the 
tin man.” 

He longed for the day when he 
would see them fall like leaves 
out of his mind, and death take 
them. 

“Tony the tin man. Tony the 
tin man.” 

How had they known that his 
father was a used metal dealer? 

Colonel Peter Cooper was wait- 
ing for him. 

“You surely took your time, 
Anthony. The reaction was reg- 
istered, but it would take us hours 
to pin-point its source without 
your help. Now then, explain as 
calmly as you can what you have 
felt or experienced. Or, more to 
the point, where are they?” 

“No. You will have to answer 
me certain questions first.” 

“I haven’t the time to waste, 
Anthony. Tell me at once what it 
is and where.” 

“No. There is no other way. 
You have to bargain with me.” 

“One does not bargain with re- 
stricted persons.” 

“Well, I will bargain till I find 
out just what it means that I 
am a restricted person.” 

“You really don’t know? Well, 
we haven’t time to fix that stub- 
born streak in you. Quickly, just 



what is it that you have to 
know?” 

“I have to know what a re- 
stricted person is. I have to know 
why the children hoot Tony the 
tin man’ at me. How can they 
know that my father was a junk 
dealer?” 

66''^OU had no father. We give 
to each of you a sufficient 
store of memories and a back- 
ground of a distant town. That 
happened to be yours, but th°re 
is no connection here. The chil- 
dren call you Tony the Tin Man 
because (like all really cruel 
creatures) they have an instinct 
for the truth that can hurt; and 
they will never forget it.” 

‘Then I am a tin man?” 

‘Well, no. Actually only seven- 
teen percent metal. And less than 
a third of one percent tin. You 
are compounded of animal, vege- 
table, and mineral fiber, and there 
was much effort given to your 
manufacture and programming. 
Yet the taunt of the children is 
essentially true.” 

“Then, if I am only Tony the 
Tin Man, how can I know all the 
people in the world in my mind?” 
“You have no mind.” 

“In my brain then. How can all 
that be in one small brain?” 
“Because your brain is not in 
your head, and it is not small. 
Come, I may as well show it to 
you; Fve told you enough that it 



160 



GALAXY 



won’t matter if you know a little 
more. There are few who are 
taken on personally conducted 
sight-seeing tours of their own 
brains. You should be grateful. 

“Gratitude seems a little tardy.” 

They went into the barred 
area, down into the bowels of the 
main building of the center. And 
they looked at the brain of 
Anthony Trotz, a restricted per- 
son in its special meaning. 

“It is the largest in the world” 
said Colonel Cooper. 

“How large?” 

“A little over twelve hundred 
cubic meters.” 

‘What a brain! And it is 
mine?” 

“You are an adjunct to it, a 
runner for it, an appendage, inas- 
much as you are anything at all.” 

“Colonel Cooper, how long 
have I been alive?” 

“You are not.” 

“How long have I been as I am 
now?” 

“It is three days since you 
were last reassigned, since you 
were assigned to this. At that 
time your nervousness and ap- 
prehensions were introduced. An 
apprehensive unit will be more 
inclined to notice details just a 
little out of the ordinary.” 

“And what is my purpose?” 

They were walking now back 
to the office ■ work area, and 
Anthony had a sad feeling at 
leaving his brain behind him. 



‘This is a filter center, and 
your purpose is to serve as a 
filter, of a sort. Every person has 
a slight aura around him. It is 
a characteristic of his, and is 
part of his personality and pur- 
pose. And it can be detected, 
electrically, magnetically, even 
visually under special conditions. 
The accumulator at which we 
were looking (your brain) is 
designed to maintain contact with 
all the auras in the world, and to 
keep a running and complete 
data on them all. It contains a 
multiplicity of circuits for each of 
its three billion and some sub- 
jects. However, as aid to its 
operation, it was necessary to 
assign several artificial conscious- 
nesses to it. You are one of these.” 

^^HE dogs and the children had 
found a new victim in the 
streets below. Anthony’s heart 
went out to him. 

“The purpose,” continued Colo- 
nel Cooper, “was to notice any- 
thing just a little bit peculiar in 
the auras and the persons they 
represent, anything at all odd in 
their comings and goings. Any- 
thing like what you have come 
here to report to me.” 

“Like the seven persons who 
recently arrived in the world, and 
not by way of birth?” 

“Yes. We have been expecting 
the first of the aliens for months. 
We must know their area, and at 



ALL THE PEOPLE 



161 



once. Now tell me.” 

“What if they are not aliens at 
all. What if they are restricted 
persons like myself?” 

“Restricted persons have no 
aura, are not persons, are not 
alive. And you would not re- 
ceive knowledge of them.” 

“Then how do I know the other 
restricted persons here, Adrian 
and Wellington, and such?” 

“You know them at first hand. 
You do not know them through 
the machine. Now tell me the 
area quickly. The center may be 
a primary target. It will take the 
machine hours to ravel it out. 
Your only purpose is to serve as 
an intuitive short-cut.” 

But Tin Man Tony did not 
speak. He only thought in his 
mind — more accurately, in his 
brain, a hundred yards away. He 
thought in his fabricated con- 
sciousness: 

“The area is quite near. If the 
colonel were not burdened with a 
mind, he would be able to think 
more clearly. He would know 
that cruel children and dogs love 



to worry what is not human, and 
that all of the restricted persons 
are accounted for in this area. He 
would know that they are worry- 
ing one of the aliens in the street 
below, and that is the area that 
is right in my consciousness. 

“I wonder if they will be better 
masters? He is an imposing figure, 
and he would be able to pass for 
a man. And the colonel is right; 
The Center is a primary target. 

‘Why! I never knew you could 
kill a child just by pointing a 
finger at him like that! What op)- 
portunities I have missed! Enemy 
of my enemy, you are my friend.” 
And aloud he said to the colo- 
nel: 

“I will not tell you.” 

“Then we’ll have you apart and 
get it out of you mighty quick.” 
“How quick?” 

“Ten minutes.” 

“Time enough,” said Tony, for 
he knew them now, coming in like 
snow. They were arriving in the 
world by the hundreds, and not 
arriving by birth.

about us that we've never known.

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



I 

UWT S’RE just starting 
i on the first one — 

I T T Walraven, ship’s 

|i communications man,” Costain 
I said, low-voiced. “Captain Maxon 
I and Vaughn have called in. 
I There’s been no word from Ra- 
I gan.” 

I Coordinator Erwin took his 

i THE FEELING 



seat beside the psychologist, his 
bearing as militarily authorita- 
tive in spite of civilian clothing 
as the room’s air was medical. 

“Maybe Ragan won’t turn up,” 
Erwin said. “Maybe we’ve still 
got a man out there to bring the 
ship back.” 

Costain made a quieting ges- 



163 



ture, his eyes on the three-man 
psych team grouped about Wal- 
raven’s wheeled reclining chair. 
“They’ve given Walraven a light 
somnolent. Not enough to put 
him out, just enough to make 
him relive the flight in detail. 
Accurately.” 

The lead psych man killed the 
room’s lighting to a glow. “Lieu- 
tenant Walraven, the ship is 
ready. You are at your post, with 
Captain Maxon and Lieutenants 
Vaughn and Ragan. The first 
Mars flight is about to blast off. 
How do you feel?” 

Walraven lay utterly relaxed, 
his face dreaming. His voice had 
the waning sound of a tape run- 
ning down for lack of power. 

“Jumpy,” he said. “But not 
really afraid. We’re too well con- 
ditioned for that, I guess. This is 
a big thing, an important thing. 
Exciting.” 

TT HAD been exciting at first. 

The long preparation over, 
training and study and news in- 
terviews and final parties all 
dreamlike and part of the past. 
Outside now, invisible but heart- 
eningly present beyond the ship’s 
impermeable hull, the essential 
and privileged people waiting to 
see them off. The ship’s power 
plant was humming gently like 
a giant, patient cat. 

Captain Maxon passed out 
muscle-relaxant capsules. The 



total boneless relaxation that 
was their defense against accele- 
ration came quickly. 

The ship was two hours out, 
beyond lunar orbit and still ac- 
celerating, when, trained for 
months against the moment, set 
each about his task. Readings 
occupied Maxon and Vaughn 
and Ragan while Walraven 
checked his communications and 
telemetering gear. 

It was not until the trans- 
mitter slot had licked up its first 
coded tape — no plain text here, 
security before even safety — 
and reported all well, the pre- 
dicted borne out, that they be- 
came aware of the Feeling. 

The four of them sat in their 
unsqueaking gimbaled seats and 
looked at each other, sharing the 
Feeling and knowing that they 
shared it, but not why. Vaughn, 
who was given to poetry and 
some degree of soul-searching, 
made the first open recognition. 

“There’s something wrong,” 
he said. 

The others agreed and, agree- 
ing, could add nothing of ex- 
planation to the wrongness. Time 
passed while they sat, seeing 
within themselves for the answer 
— and if not for answer, at least 
for identification — but nothing 
came and nothing changed ex- 
cept that with time the steady 
pressure of the Feeling grew 
stronger. 



164 



GALAXY 



Vaughn, again, was first to 
react to the pressure. “We’ve got 
to do something.” He twisted 
out of his seat and wavered in 
the small pseudogravity of the 
ship’s continuing, acceleration. 
“I’ve never in my life felt so 
desolate, so — ” 

He stopped. “There aren’t any 
words,” he said helplessly. 

Less articulate than Vaughn 
and knowing it, the others did 
not try to help find the words. 
Only Ragan, professional soldier 
without family or close tie any- 
where in the world, had a sug- 
I gestion. 

I “The ship’s power plant is 
partly psionic,” Ragan said. “I 
don’t understand the principle, 

I but it’s been drilled into us that 
no other system can give a one- 
directional thrust without reac- 
tion. The psi-drive is tied into 
our minds in the same way it’s 
tied into the atomic and elec- 
tronic components. It’s part of us 
and we’re part of it.” 

Even Maxon, crew authority 
on the combination drive, missed 
his meaning at first. 

“If our atomic shielding fails,” 
Ragan explained, “we’re irra- 
diated. If our psionics bank fails, 
we may feel anything. Maybe 
the trouble is there.” 

Privately they disagreed, cer- 
tain that nothing so disquieting 
as the Feeling that weighted 
them down could be induced even 



by so cryptic a marriage of dis- 
similar principles as made up the 
ship’s power plant. Still it was a 
possible avenue of relief. 

“It’s worth trying,” Maxon 
said, and they checked. 

And checked, and checked. 

V|^E WORKED for hours,” 
Walraven said, “but 
nothing came of it. None of us, 
even Maxon, knew enough about 
the psi-drive to be sure, but we 
ended up certain that the trouble 
wasn’t there. It was in us.” 

The drug was wearing thin, 
leaving him pale and shaken. His 
face had a glisten of sweat under 
the lowered lights. 

The lead psych man chose a 
hypodermic needle, looked to 
Erwin and Costain for authority, 
and administered a second in- 
jection. 

“You gave up searching,” he 
said. “What then. Lieutenant?” 

“We waited,” Walraven said. 

He relaxed, his face smooth- 
ing to impersonal detachment as 
his mind slipped back to the 
ship and its crew. Watching, Cos- 
tain felt a sudden deep unease 
as if the man’s mind had really 
winged back through time and 
space and carried a part of his 
own with it. 

“There was only one more pos- 
sible check,” Walraven said. “We 
had to wait two days for that.” 

The check was Maxon’s idea. 



THE FEELING 



165 




I simple of execution and unar- 
guable of result. At halfway 
point acceleration must cease, 
the ship rotate on its gyros and 
deceleration set in. There would 
be a period of waiting when the 
{ power plant must be shut off 
completely. 

If the Feeling stemmed from 
the psi-drive, it would lift then. 

It did not lift. They sat 
weightless and disoriented while 
the gyros processed and the ship 
swung end by end and the steady 
pressure of the Feeling mounted 

■ up and up without relief. 

“It gets worse every hour,” 

Vaughn said raggedly. 

“It’s not a matter of time,” 
Maxon said. “It’s the distance. 
The Feeling grows stronger as 
we get farther from home.” 

They sat for another time 
without talk, feeling the distance 
build up behind them and sens- 
ing through the unwindowed hull 
of the ship what the emptiness 
;■ outside must be like. The ship 
was no longer an armored pro- 
jectile bearing them snugly and 
swiftly to a first planetfall. It 
was a walnut shell without 
strength or direction. 

In the end they talked out 
their problem because there was 
nothing else they could do. 

“We’re men,” Maxon said, not 
III as if he must convince himself 
K but as if it were a premise that 

■ had to be made, a starting point 

^THE FEELING 

i 



for all logic. “We’re reasoning 
creatures. If the trouble lies in 
ourselves we can find its source 
and its reason for being.” 

He picked Vaughn first be- 
cause Vaughn had been first to 
sense the wrongness and because 
the most sensitive link in a chain 
is also predictably its weakest. 

“Try,” Maxon said. “I know 
there are no words to describe 
this thing, but get as close as you 
can.” 

^^AUGHN tried. “It isn’t home- 
^ sickness. It’s a different 
thing altogether from nostalgia. 
It’s not just fear. I’m afraid — 
not of any thing, just afraid in 
the way a child is afraid of fall- 
ing in his dreams, when he’s 
really had no experience with 
falling because he’s never fallen 
more than a few inches in his 
life . When I think of my wife, 
it’s not the same at all as if I 
were just in some far corner of 
the Earth with only land and 
water between us. Even if I were 
marooned on an uncharted island 
somewhere with no hope of see- 
ing home again, I wouldn’t feel 
this way. There wouldn’t be this 
awful pulling.” 

Ragan agreed with Vaughn 
that the Feeling was essentially 
a pull, but beyond agreement 
could add nothing. Ragan had 
covered the world without form- 
ing a tie to hold him; one place 



167 



was as good as another and he 
felt no loss for any particular 
spot on Earth. 

“I only want to be back there,” 
he said simply. “Anywhere but 
here.” 

“I was born on a farm in New 
England,” Walraven said. “Out 
of the land, like my father and 
his people before him. I’m part 
of that land, no matter how far 
from it I go, because everything 
I am came from it. I feel up- 
rooted. I don’t belong here.” 

Uprooted was the key for 
which they had hunted. 

Maxon said slowly, “There 
are wild animals on Earth that 
can’t live away from their natu- 
ral homes. Insects — how does 
a termite feel, cut off from its 
hive? Maybe that’s our trouble. 
Something bigger than individual 
men made the human race what 
it is. Maybe we’ve been a sort of 
composite being all along, with- 
out knowing it, tied together by 
the need of each other and not 
able to exist apart. Maybe no 
one knew it before because no 
one was ever isolated in the way 
we are.” 

Walraven had more to say, 
almost defiant in his earnestness. 
“This is going to sound wild, but 
I’ve been fighting inside myself 
ever since Vaughn mentioned be- 
ing pulled toward home. I have 
the feeling that if Fd only let go, 
I’d be back where I belong.” He 



snapped his fingers, the sound 
loud in the room. “Like that.” 

No one laughed because each 
found in himself the same con- 
viction waiting to be recognized. 
Ragan said, “Walraven’s right. 
There’s no place on Earth I care 
for more than another, but I feel 
I could be back there in any one 
of them” — he snapped his fin- 
gers, as Walraven had done — 
“as quickly as that.” 

“I know,” Maxon said. “But 
we can’t let go. We were sent out 
to put this ship into orbit around 
Mars. We’ve got to take her 
there.” 

"W^ALRAVEN said, “It wasn’t 
" easy. The Feeling got worse 
as we went out and out. Knowing 
what it was helped a little, but 
not enough. We held onto each 
other, the four of us, to keep 
the group together. We knew 
what would happ>en if we let go.” 
The head psych man looked to 
Costain and put his needle away 
when Costain shook his head. 

“The ship,” Coordinator Erwin 
said sharply. “Walraven, you did 
put her into orbit?” 

“Yes,” Walraven said. “We put 
her into orbit and turned on the 
telemetering equipment — ^theyll 
be picking up her signals by 
now — and then we turned our 
backs on each other and we let 
go. There wasn’t any feeling of 
motion or speed, but I felt a

fresh breeze on my face and 
when I opened my eyes I was 
standing beside a familiar stone 
fence on a hill above the house 
where I was born. You haven’t 
told me, but the others came 
back, too, didn’t they?” 

“All but Ragan,” Erwin said. 
His tone made Costain think 
wryly. Even the military can 
snatch at straws. “Maxon and 
Vaughn called in. But we haven’t 
heard from Ragan.” 

“He wasn’t left behind,” Wal- 
raven said with certainty. 
“Ragan has no family, but he has 
a home. We’re standing on it.” 
An orderly came in with an 
envelope for Costain, who open- 
ed it and handed the paper to 
Erwin. To Walraven, Costain 
said, “It’s a cablegram from 
North Ireland. Ragan is back.” 



Erwin was still gripping the 
paper in his hand when he walk- 
ed with Costain out of the hos- 
pital into the bright airiness of 
a spring day. He glared at the 
warm, blue sky. 

“We’ll find a way,” Erwin said. 
“We’ve proved that we can put 
men on Mars. With the right 
conditioning, we can keep them 
there.” 

“You’re a dedicated and reso- 
lute man. Coordinator,” Costain 
said. “Do you really suppose that 
any amount of conditioning could 
fit you to do what those boys 
failed at?” 

The long moment of consider- 
ing that passed before Erwin 
answered left a fine sheen of 
sweat on his face. 

“No,” Erwin said.

of a letter that never got mailed, 
a broken galosh clip, a wistful 
memory of violet eyes, the Mal- 
thusian theory and a cheese 
strudel. However, it is Tandy’s. 

We begin then with the Cana- 
veral sneeze, delivered by a 
white-gowned, sterile-gloved man 
in a germ-free lab, as gently he 
lifted a gold-plated twenty-three- 
inch sphere into its ultimate 
package. Not having a third hand 
at the time, he was unable to 



cover his mouth in time. Ge- 
sundheit. 

And now to Tandy’s story. 



' I ■'ANDY’S brother Robin was an 
■*- only child for the first two 
years of his life and he would 
never get over it. Noel, her sister, 
was born when Tandy was cross- 
ing that high step into conscious- 
ness called Three Years Old. 
(Timothy, the other brother, 
wasn’t until later. Anjrway, this 



TANDY'S STORY

isn’t his story. This is Tandy’s 
story.) 

When Tandy was five, then, it 
was clear to her that while the 
older Robin was bigger, stronger, 
more knowledgeable and smarter 
(he wasn’t, but she hadn’t been 
around long enough to learn that 
yet) and could push her around 
at will until she yelled for help 
— while, to put it another way, 
she was attacked from above — 
the sister below was excavating 
the groimd under her feet. Noel 
imaccountably delighted every- 
one else, even Robin, for she was 
a blithe little bundle. But her 
advent necessarily drained off a 
good deal of parental attention 
from Tandy, who lost the house- 
hold position of The Baby with- 
out gaining Robin’s altitude as 
The Firstborn. It didn’t seem fair. 
So she did what she could about 
it. She yelled for help. 

It wasn’t any ordinary yell, if 
an ordinary yell is a kind of 
punctuation or explosion or com- 
municative change-of-pace. There 
were times when it wasn’t, except 
for its purpose and figuratively, 
a yell at all. It was at times a 
whine — a highly specialized 
one, not very loud but strident, 
that could creep in and out of 
her voice twice in a sentence. Or 
it might be merely a way of ask- 
ing for something, and asking 
and asking, so that she couldn’t 
even hear a “yes” and was not 



aware of the point at which it 
furiously turned to a “no.” Or 
perhaps an instantaneous ap- 
proach to tears, complete with 
filling eyes and twisting mouth, 
where anyone else might use the 
mildest emphasis: “It was Tues- 
day I wore the blue dress, not 
Monday,” and the equally instan- 
taneous disappearance of the 
tears (which, somehow, was the 
annoying part). Or utter, total, 
complete, unmoving non-response 
to an order through the third, the 
fourth, the fifth repetition, and 
then a sudden shattering screech; 
“I heard you!” 

Tandy had, in short, a talent 
approaching genius for getting 
under one’s skin and prickling. 

This established, it is mere 
justice to all concerned to report 
also that Tandy was loved and 
lovable as well. Her parents took 
the matter of child-rearing seri- 
ously. The reasons (over and 
above innate talent) for Tand3r’s 
more irritating proclivities were 
quite known to them. And Tandy, 
long-lashed, supple, with hair the 
color of buckwheat honey and 
golden freckles spattered across 
her straight perfect nose, was an 
affectionate child, and her parents 
loved her and showed it very 
often. 

And this did not alter one whit 
her position as No. Two Child, 
her distaste for the role, her yell- 
ing for help and therefore, for all

the love, the concurrent war of 
abrasion. 

There were times when she and 
Robin got along as contempora- 
ries and splendidly. And of 
course almost anyone could get 
along with the biddable Noel. 
But these times were more 
wished-for than often. When they 
occurred, they were so welcome 
that one is reminded of the lady 
with the perennially battling chil- 
dren who called out into an un- 
wonted silence one mid-morning: 
“What are you kids doing?” From 
under the porch a young voice 
replied, “Burning the wrappers 
off these razorblades with match- 
es, Mommy.” “That’s nice,” she 
replied, “Don’t fight . .” 

At such times, in short, they 
could get away with practically 
anything, and Tandy’s usual oc- 
cupations were staged alone and 
away from people. 

Yet never completely away. 

T>ERHAPS as a result of her 
crowded loneliness, she liked 
to be on the outside looking in 
or on the inside looking on, but 
not of the group. When the 
neighborhood gathered on the 
lawn for hide-and-seek or kick- 
ball, and the game was well 
started, Tandy would be seen 
forty paces off, squatting by the 
driveway, making a cake-sized 
cake of earth, perhaps, and deco- 
rating it with pebbles and twigs; 



or acting out some elaborate 
dialogue with her doll Luby 
(whether or not Luby was with 
her,) bowing and mugging and 
murmuring the while in a num- 
ber of voices. Tandy spoke beauti- 
fully. She had since the begin- 
ning, and her command of idiom 
and tone was too expert to be 
cute. There were times when it 
was downright embarrassing, as 
when the father overheard her 
demanding of a peonybush, with 
precisely his own emphasis, “What 
the hell are you, hypnotized?” 
There were times when these per- 
formances at the edge of the acti- 
vity of others attracted consider- 
able attention. She was surpris- 
ingly deft for a five-year-old, 
being one of these kids who from 
birth, apparently, can with a 
single movement draw a closed 
figure so that you are unable to 
see where the ends of the line 
join, and whose structures with 
blocks never seem jumbled, but 
quite functional (as indeed, to 
the fantasy of the moment, they 
are). Once in a while she drew 
quite a gallery of the curious 
with, say, six careful rows of red 
Japanese maple leaves and deep 
pink trumpet-vine blossoms al- 
ternating on the lawn, before 
which she would posture severely, 
murmuring under her breath and 
pointing to one and another with 
a stick. At such times she seemed 
quite oblivious to six or eight

children magnetically drawn 
round her, who watched mysti- 
fied. Sometimes she would answer 
and sometimes she would not. 
Sometimes it would take drastic 
measures, as for example Robin’s 
shuffling through the careful ar- 
rangement of leaves and petals, 
before it could be learned (the 
hard way, in this case) that she 
was teaching school, that the 
leaves were boys and the trum- 
pets girls, and that she was now 
going to tell Mama to throw 
Robin’s Erector set into the gar- 
bage, and a good deal more — 
precisely what more, no one 
knew, for by then the screech 
would have destroyed intelligibil- 
ity. 

THE CRINKLED getter was 
placed near the base and inside 
the metal envelope of an RF 
amplifier tube in the telemetry 
circuit of the big rocket’s second 
stage. The getter’s function was 
to absorb the residual gases in 
the tube and harden the vacuum 
therein. Its crinkle was an im- 
purity, but so slight as to cause 
no trouble until the twelfth hour 
of countdown. Then rarefied gas 
began to ionize and toop! dis- 
charge and ionize and foop! dis- 
charge again. 

To replace the tube required 
that they go back to twenty-four 
hours and start the countdown 
again. The extra twelve hours de- 



lay enabled sneeze-mist to dry on 
the sphere, and certain bacilli to 
die, and others to encyst, and a 
smear of virus, sub-microscopic- 
ally, to turn to a leathery, almost 
crystalline jelly. 

^ANDY lived in a house in the 
woods which in turn were in, 
or nearly in, the very middle of 
the upstate village, a pleasant ac- 
cident derived from the land- 
grabbing, land-holding traditions 
of three neighbors’ fathers, and 
grandfathers, and great-grand- 
fathers. The three acres on which 
Tandy’s house stood were sur- 
rounded by perhaps twenty acres 
of other people’s woods and a 
small swamp; yet the house was 
barely ten minutes on foot away 
from the village green. 

Somewhere, then, in house or 
garden, lawn, swamp or wood, the 
brownie came to Tandy. 

It had that stuffed-toy, left-out- 
in-the-rain aspect possible only to 
stuffed toys which have been left 
out in the rain. It was about nine 
inches high. Its clothing, or skin 
(properly, the outside layer was 
both), was variously khaki-color- 
ed and mottled green. The appel- 
lation “brownie” derived from 
what appeared to be a tapered 
hat, though once the father was 
heard to remark that it was the 
damn thing’s head that was 
pointed. The arms and legs were 
taut and jointless, and looked 



174 



GALAXY 



like sausages on which lived 
lichens. For hands there were 
limp yellow-pink leaves of felt, 
and for feet, what might have 
been the model for a radical 
cartoonist’s rendering of the 
knotted moneybags of Old Mon- 
eybags. As for a face — well, it was 
a face. That’s all. Black disks for 
eyes, so faded you couldn’t tell 
whether they were supposed to be 
open or closed, a ditto-mark for a 
nose and a streak below which 
may have been some clumsy 
whimsy — a smile up on the right 
scowling downward to the left — 
or a streak of dirt. 

In the light of all that hap- 
pened, one would think there 
would be a day of discovery, an 
hour of revelation, an open-the- 
package kind of Event. But there 
wasn’t. 

The brownie was kicking 
around the place for weeks, 
months maybe; they had all seen 
it, kicked it aside, used it as a 
peg for that parental sigh, “Got 
to clean out all this junk some- 
time . .” Robin dug a grave for 
a dead cat once and then couldn’t 
find the cat, so buried the 
brownie instead. Noel had taken 
it to bed with her once, and the 
mother had thrown it out the 
window during the night. It was 
one of those things, along with 
the bent but not quite broken 
doll carriage, the toy electric 
motor with the broken brush and 



Noel’s wind-up giraffe, which 
needed new ears. So the brownie 
wove its indistinct thread into 
the tapestry of days, in and out 
of the margin between toys and 
trash. 

The exact beginnings of 
Tandy’s preoccupation with the 
brownie were also vague, and 
even when first her interest was 
total, it made little impression, 
because Tandy was . well, for 
example, the caterpillar. Once 
when she was four she caught a 
tent caterpillar and kept him in 
a coffee can for two days and 
named him Freddy and fed and 
watered him and even covered 
him at night with a doll blanket. 
During the second night she 
awoke crying, agonizing after 
Freddy, inconsolable until the 
can was found and brought and 
shown to her. Her grandmother, 
who was around at the time, said 
sagely, “That child needs a pet!” 
and everybody nodded and con- 
versed about pets. The next morn- 
ing Tandy put Freddy on the 
flagstones out front “so he could 
go for a walk.” He went for a 
walk. Altogether. 

For half a day people tiptoed 
around Tandy as if she were full 
of fulminate and had dined on 
dynamite. 

But not only did she not ask 
about Freddy, she never even 
mentioned him. She stumbled 
over the can and almost fell and

kicked it away and did not even 
glance at it Thereafter Tandy’s 
preoccupations were beyond judg- 
ment or prediction; they might be 
blood-sistership, like the affair 
with her doll Luby Cindy, or they 
might be passing passions like 
Freddy. The brownie . well, 
people became aware not that 
Tandy had a new one, but that 
for some indeterminate time she 
had been orbiting around this 
artifact. And when Tandy orbited, 
so did the cosmos or it — all of 
it — would be accountable to 
Tandy. 

1^/|’ENTION of orbit brings up 
the Condition adrift. No other 
name for it will do, and even that 
is inaccurate. It was . well, 
matter; but matter in such a cur- 
licue, so self-involved in stress, 
that Condition is a better word 
than Thing. It had been made 
where it was useful to its makers, 
and one might say it had a life 
of its own though it had not 
used it in some millions of mega- 
years. By a coincidence as Un- 
likely as the existence of the 
reader of this history or a world 
to read it on, but as true, the 
Condition adrift found itself 
matching course and speed with 
the golden ball in space. It con- 
tacted, interpenetrated, an area 
of the golden surface four by 
eight microns, and happily found 
itself a part of organic material 



— a dried and frozen virus and 
two encysted bacteria. The latter 
it dissected and used. The former 
it activated, but in a wild re- 
organizing way so radical its 
mammy amino wouldn’t have 
recognized it. The Condition be- 
came then a Thing (without 
losing its conditional character) 
and it scored itself across and 
divided. And divided again. And 
that was the end of that, for it 
had used up its store of a cer- 
tain substance too technical to 
mention, but as necessary as num- 
ber. Such was the nature of this 
organism that once alive it must 
grow, but if it could not grow it 
must cease dividing, and if it 
ceased dividing it must undergo 
an elaborate, eons-long cycle ’ be- 
fore it could come round to being 
again a mere Condition adrift. 
But unless it could begin that 
cycle it must die. 

By means known to it, it 
flowed through the lattices of the 
sputtered gold, quartered the 
sphere, searched and probed, and 
at last stopped. 

It turned its attention to the 
great globe beneath. 

^OME TIME or other — it was 
^ in the early spring, though 
Tandy herself could never re- 
member just when — she got the 
brownie a house. Actually it was 
an old basketwork fishing creel 
she had found behind the garage. 



176 



GALAXY 



but the one thing one learned 
most quickly about Tandy was 
that things were what she said 
they were. Anything else was only 
your opinion, to which you were 
not entitled. And there was a cer- 
tain justice in her attitude, for it 
did not take long for such an 
object to lose its creelship and 
become what she said it was. 

She set it against the back wall 
of the garage, in the tangled 
ground between the wall and the 
old stone fence, under the shelter 
of the adjoining carport — for 
a wall-less shelter had been hung 
to the side of the garage to 
accommodate the second car 
they hoped for some day. It 
was a nice sort of outdoors-in- 
doors place. She drove a row of 
stakes in front of the creel and 
on it placed a rectangle of dis- 
carded plywood — a miniature of 
the carport — but as time went on 
she added walls. First they were 
cardboard. The creel was the 
bedroom and the rest of it was 
the living room. 

At Easter she saved her basket 
and it was a bed. She got the 
brownie up every morning and 
put him to bed every night, and 
on weekends he took his nap 
too. 

She fed him. 

She had a small table — not a 
cream cheese box, a table! — for 
him, and on the table were clam- 
shell plates and an acorn cup. 



and a pill-bottle — strike that; a 
flower vase — which, from the 
time spring first started to show 
her colors, she kept supplied. But 
before that she was feeding him 
snow ice-cream, sawdust cereal, 
mushroom steaks, and wooden 
bread. She talked to him con- 
stantly, sometimes severely. And 
in that unannounced way of hers, 
she spent all her free time with 
him. 

No one noticed it especially, 
in March and almost through 
April, except perhaps to be grate- 
ful for the quiet. A minute spent 
with the brownie was a minute 
without Tandy’s moaning, whin- 
ing, sobbing, screeching or other- 
wise yelling for help. Of course, 
there had to be minutes spent 
away from the brownie. Most of 
them were at school. 

SCHOOL was kindergarten, of 
^ course, and it may have been 
that there was just too much of 
it for Tandy. Due to factors of 
distance and necessities of school 
buses, the kindergarten was not, 
as is usual for such establish- 
ments, a nine-to-noon affair, but 
instead lasted for the whole 
school day, ending at three. In 
spite of a long rest period after 
lunch, it was the opinion of many 
that this was asking too much of 
five-year-olds. It may have been 
the teacher’s opinion as well. It 
was certainly Tandy’s opinion. 



TANDY'S STORY 



177 




Her first report card was not 
resoundingly good, and her sec- 
ond one was somewhat worse. 
Neither was bad enough to cause 
concern, but the parents were 
jolted by the specific items on 
which she scored worst. Beside 
the item Speak clearly and dis- 
tinctly the teacher had marked 
the symbols which meant “Hardly 
ever,” and beside Knows right 
from left was the mark for “Sel- 
dom.” The parents looked at one 
another in amazement, and then 
the father said, “That can’t be 
right!” and the mother said, “That 
can’t even be Tandy. She’s given 
her the wrong report card!” 

But she had not, as the mother 
found out by visiting the teacher 
at school one afternoon. 

The mother, going in like a 
lion, came out numb with awe for 
the teacher’s forbearance, and for 
the second time (Robin had done 
this to her once, on another 
matter) suffering that partly 
amused but nonetheless painful 
experience of learning how little 
one knows of one’s own. Or as 
the bemused father put it, “It’s 
a wise father who knows his own 
child.” For, fully documented and 
with inescapable accuracy, the 
teacher had described a Tandy 
they never saw around the house 
— a Tandy recalcitrant, stubborn, 
inactive, disobedient and, most 
incredible of all, talking incessant 
baby talk. The teacher’s ability 



to see below the surface, to know 
that the child wasn’t really as 
bad as all that, helped the overall 
picture not at all, because it be- 
came manifest that Tandy did 
not know right from left on pur- 
pose; that she spoke baby-talk by 
choice; that she fell from grace in 
matters of handkerchiefs and 
handwashing not because she 
forgot, but because she remem- 
bered. 

Above and beyond everything 
else was that the degree of this 
behavior was by no means ex- 
cessive. She had never once been 
subjected to the routine punish- 
ment of being made to stand out 
in the hall. She could always stop 
just short of outright delinquency. 
She was the foot that drags, the 
pressure which is not quite tooth- 
ache, the discomfort which is 
not yet heartburn. 

The parents conferred unhapi- 
pily with each other and then 
with Tandy, who answered every 
“Why?” with “I just — ” and an 
infuriating shrug, rolling upward 
of the eyes, flinging the hands out 
and down to flap helplessly 
against the thighs. It was the 
mother’s exact gesture, which of 
course is precisely why it was 
infuriating. 

So the father, his anger at last 
arriving, drew a bead on Tandy 
with his long forefinger and de- 
clared, “This is a rule. No more 
brownie.” 



TANDY'S STORY 



179 



'’■''HE analogy of the Sahara 
smash is the anecdote of one 
of the desert crashes of a B-17 in 
Africa. Unlike tragic others, this 
one had a happy ending, and this 
is why: the crew made no attempt 
to trek out of there in a body, 
but instead assigned one man to 
march out and get help. The 
significant thing is that he carried 
with him not only a compass, but 
almost their entire water supply. 
The rest of the crew rationed 
themselves down to three table- 
spoonsful a day and lay as still 
as possible buried in the sand 
under the broken fuselage. So it 
was that the organism on the 
golden satellite told off one of it- 
self to ooze patiently out to the 
tip of one of the whip antennae; 
then, by means known to it- — for 
as related, it contained unheard- 
of stresses, neatly curled up and 
intertwined — it bent the whip 
double and released it, and out 
into the emptiness, in the oppo- 
site direction from orbital motion, 
was snapped this infinitesmal 
fleck of substance. It tracked 
along with the satellite for a long 
time, but separating always, until 
it was lost in the glittering empti- 
ness. But with it it carried all 
but a fraction of the organic 
substance available to the whole. 
Three parts were left quiescent, 
waiting moveless to die or be 
saved. The fourth fell toward 



Earth, which took — as long as it 
took . 

NOW THERE is a school of con- 
trol-by-giving (hits in the head or 
ice cream) and a school of taking 
away, and the father, when 
aroused, tended to the latter. In 
extreme cases a child can learn 
never to express preference or 
fondness for anything lest he 
qualify it for the disciplinary list. 
This was not that extreme. It 
would not be because of the 
mother, who despised this kind of 
thing and whose reactions were 
very fast. One glimpse of Tandy’s 
stricken face at this “No more 
brownie!” dictum and she added, 
“. if you go on making people 
unhappy.” And, ignoring the 
father’s stifled cry of rage, she 
went on, “Now you run on out 
and talk it over with the brownie.” 

Tandy did as she was told, 
leaving her parents to instruct 
one another about child-rearing, 
and communed with the brownie; 
and perhaps this was the real 
beginning of it all. 

For she had done a great deal 
for this brownie. Now, for the 
first time, she had made it clear 
that there were things that need- 
ed doing for her. 

If things changed at school, it 
was naturally not immediately 
apparent at home. Things at 
home did not change. That is, the 
busy-ness with the brownie con-

tinned to use up the whining time, 
the screeching time, the opportu- 
nities for chance medley and 
battle royal with Noel and Robin. 

One weekday morning the 
mother had hung out a line-full 
of clothes and, being face to face 
with the garage, was moved to 
go round and see how Tandy 
was coming along with Project 
Brownie. She hadn’t seen it for 
some weeks. She recalled vaguely 
that the cardboard sides had been 
replaced, and she knew that the 
tiny flower-vase had borne vio- 
lets, and baby’s breath, and alys- 
sum. And she recalled the time 
she had turned out her sewing 
basket apd the kitchen gadget 
drawer and rearranged them, all 
in one morning, and had given the 
detritus to Tandy for her brownie. 
Time was when Tandy would 
have gathered up such a trea- 
sure-trove with a shrill shriek 
of joy, would have fought self- 
ishly and jealously with the 
other children over the own- 
ership of every ribbon-end, 
every old cork and worn-out 
baby-bottle nipple, only to leave 
bits and pieces exasperatingly all 
over the house and yard within 
the next couple of hours. But this 
time she had spread the whole 
clutter out on the living room 
table, darted her deft small 
hands in and out of the pile, and 
in a few seconds had selected the 
blunt end of a broken nutpick. 



the china handle of a Wedgewood 
pitcher, a small tangle of pale 
blue nylon-and-wool yarn, and a 
brass wing-nut. “He wants these,” 
she said positively. “That’s all?” 
the mother had asked, astonished. 
And Tandy had replied, precisely 
mimicking the father, “Now what 
would a brownie want with all 
that junk?” It wasn’t so much 
the modesty of Tandy’s wants 
that had surprised the mother. It 
was the absolute and unhesitating 
certainty with which she chose. 

Thinking of this, the mother 
rounded the garage and saw the 
brownie’s house. 

^I'HE OLD creel was still the 
bedroom, but the rest of the 
structure had vastly altered. The 
cardboard walls had been re- 
placed with wood — some ends of 
shiplap that used to lie under the 
sleeping-porch — and since the 
mother had heard nothing of any 
carpentry by or for Tandy, she 
could see that the stony ground 
had been carefully and labori- 
ously dug to various depths so 
that the little boards, buried up>- 
right, could present an even eave- 
line. On one side were two small 
square window-openings, glazed 
with cellophane; on the other was 
a longer opening like a picture- 
window. The roof, still the cast- 
off piece of plywood, had been 
covered with a layer of earth, 
and smoothly, brilliantly, it was

thatched with living star-moss. 

The mother knelt to look in- 
side. The floor of the house was 
covered with a blinding-white 
powder of some kind. She took 
a pinch of it and felt it and smelt 
it and even tasted it a little with- 
out recognizing it; she’d ask 
Tandy later. The table was cov- 
ered with a cloth which had once 
been part of a dust-rag which had 
once been one of the mother’s 
dresses; it was spotlessly clean — 
it seemed even to have been 
ironed — and was so folded and 
placed that the torn edges were 
out of sight. On the table was 
the pill-bottle flower-vase, just 
half full of clean water, in which 
stood a single stem and blossom 
of bleeding-heart. The effect was 
simple, tasteful, sort of Japan- 
ese-y. And further inside was the 
creel bedroom, with an oval 
dresser (despite the neat cloth 
cover and skirt, she recognized 
the lines of an inverted sardine 
tin) over which was the mirror 
which had been in Tandy’s birth- 
day pocketbook, and before which 
was a handsome little round 
chair, made of a bit of cardboard 
glued to a large wooden thread- 
spool, also covered and skirted 
with a scrap of material match- 
ing the dresser. And in bed was 
the brownie. 

The mother had to go down 
almost flat on her stomach to see 
what it was which covered his 



pillow so whitely, so clean and 
thick-textured. A luxury material 
indeed — dogwood petals. He was 
covered with a quilt (she couldn’t 
bring herself to call it one of her 
old pot-holders) and he was sleep- 
ing. 

She chuckled at herself. How 
were those round black painted 
eyes to look open or closed? . 
and she looked again and thought 
they were open. She almost said 
“Excuse me!” and she actually 
did blush at disturbing his nap. 
Wagging her head, she backed 
away and stood up. 

Between her and the old stone 
fence was usually a carpet of 
weeds. There was no pretense of 
making lawn or garden out of 
the stony soil here. Actually, the 
front lawn had been grown on 
trucked-in topsoil. Yet — 

Yet this area was now planted. 
A row of early marigolds between 
the brownie’s house and the one- 
time weed-bed. And, from there 
to the fence, a dark-green plant, 
low, spidery, in rows. She did not 
recognize the plant except per- 
haps as just another weed. 

Speechless, she returned to the 
house. 

^ I ■'ROUBLE on the school bus 
that day; Robin came home 
bloody and triumphant. 

Mother had meant to talk about 
brownie, but it was some time 
before events sorted themselves

out. It appeared that a “big kid” 
had started chanting the well- 
known chant about “I seen 
Tandy’s underwear,” and Robin 
had punched him and gotten 
clobbered for it. The bus monitor 
broke it up, and in spite of 
Robin’s having gotten the worst 
of it, he came home bursting with 
pride and Tandy awash with ad- 
miration. 

The mother felt both. It was 
the first time Robin had ever 
brought arms to bear in defense 
of his sister, and after the ques- 
tion and cross-question and ver- 
bal jigsaw-puzzling which is al- 
ways necessary to get an anecdote 
out of a child, and the awkward 
telephone conversation with the 
parent of the party of the other 
part, she found herself alone not 
with Tandy, but with Robin, 
Tandy having escaped to her pre- 
occupation behind the garage. 

“Robin, I don’t like fighting 
but I must say, I like the way 
you took up for Tandy.” 

“Aw, she’s okay,” said Robin, 
not noticing how the mother of 
what he usually called that little 
tattletale, that squeaky wheel, 
that pushfaced squint-eyed bow- 
legged stoop . how the mother 
of this repulsive sibling let drop 
her jaw, and slumped into a chair. 

She was still sitting there, try- 
ing to recover her strength, while 
Robin p>edalled away on his 
bicycle and while, a moment 



later, Tandy came in. She came 
totteringly, mounded down with 
clean laundry. The mother leapt 
up to help her get the screen 
door open and then had to sit 
down again. “Tandy!” she cried. 

“Well, they was all dry. 
Mommy, so I brought them in.” 
“They were,” said the mother 
weakly. 

“Sure they were. Mommy . .” 
She was going to ask for some- 
thing. If it was a diamond tiara, 
the mother thought, she’d get her 
one if she had to murder for it. 
“Yes, honey.” 

“Mommy, would you teach me 
how to set the table? I could do 
it every day while you get din- 
ner.” 

So for the time being the 
mother utterly forgot to ask any 
questions about the brownie. 

^T^HE mother thought about the 
brownie a good deal, although 
— perhaps it was a remnant of 
her comical embarrassment at 
having caught him in bed — she 
seldom went back there to look 
at the house. But one afternoon, 
thinking about the neatness of 
the little table, the dresser and 
chair and mirror, the shining 
white floor (what was that stuff, 
anyway?) it occurred to her that 
the three-year-old Noel would 
find that arrangement back there 
irresistible, and she shuddered at 
the mental picture of Noel belly-

ing delightedly into the careful 
structure, churning up the white 
floor, leaning too hard on the 
cheese-box table, tumbling the 
mossy roof. “Noel . 

“Noel, we’ve all got to be 
specially careful of Tand3^s 
brownie house. You wouldn’t ever 
play with it unless she asked you 
to, would you?” 

Noel gravely shook her hel- 
met of tight curls. “I not allowed.” 

The mother tipped her head to 
one side and regarded the child. 
There were a number of things 
Noel was not allowed to do which 
she . “But all the same, you 
won’t go back there by your- 
self.” 

“I not allowed,” said Noel with 
great emphasis, and simultane- 
ously the mother thought (a) 
that she’d like Tandy’s formula 
for not allowing if it worked like 
this and (b) let’s keep an eye 
on Noel all the same. 

It was demonstrated, about ten 
days later, just how unnecessary 
it was to stand guard over the 
brownie’s house. It was a Satur- 
day. The father was home, Robin 
was off somewhere on his bicycle, 
and Tandy was slaving happily 
away behind the garage. The 
father, from the front of the 
house, called out, “Do you know 
what happened to the hand cul- 
tivator?” 

The mother’s photographic 



memory saw it lying beside a row 
of green. Oh, of course. “Noel, 
darling, run out behind the gar- 
age and get the cultivator. 
Tandy’ll show you.” 

“Pleadingly, “No, Mommy!” 
“Noel!”. 

“I not allowed to!” said Noel, 
and incredibly, for she was a 
cheerful child, she began to cry. 

The first impulse was to lay 
on some muscle and authority, 
the next a deep sympathy for the 
little one. “Oh . Noel . .” 

“I gon’ hide!” shrieked Noel 
in something very like Tandy’s 
special rasping shriek; and go 
she did, hide she did, ineffectively 
(the mother knew she was in 
the baby’s blue chiffonier) but 
with great purpose. Apparently 
her “not allowed” was big enough 
to make it worth while defying 
the giants. Sighing, the mother 
went to the back door. “Tandy!” 
“Yes, Mommy . .” 

“Bring Daddy’s cultivator to 
him, he needs it!” 

“The handle-fingers?” 

“That’s right, dear.” 

She watched Tandy, in a 
yellow dress, bounding from be- 
hind the garage and heading for 
the front lawn. She waited until 
she saw the flash of yellow again 
and called her to the back steps. 

“Tandy, you must have “been 
terribly rough to Noel about not 
playing with your brownie. She’s 
afraid to go back there because 



184 



GALAXY 



you said she’s not allowed.” 

“No, I didn’t. Mommy.” 

“Tandy!” (The explosion of 
the name alone was the mother’s 
favorite curb.) 

"C^OR the first time in many 
■*- weeks Tandy began to pucker 
up, the eyes grew bright, the 
mouth trembled. “I reely, reely, 
reely . .” 

Moving on impulse, the mother 
stepped forward and took Tandy’s 
wrist. “Shh, honey. Take me out 
and show me what you’re doing.” 

Tandy immediately shut it all 
off and they went back of the 
garage, Tandy skipping. The 
mother was prepared to be com- 
plimentary as one normally is, 
multiplied by the wonder of what 
she had seen before; but she was 
not prepared for what she found. 

One wall had been removed 
from the little house, the shiplap 
scraps unearthed and tossed 
aside. The roof was still sup- 
ported by the other side and the 
top of the creel. A heap of flat 
stones lay near, and a small sack 
of ready-mixed concrete. A seed- 
flat was doing service as a minia- 
ture mortar-board, and a dis- 
carded pancake-turner as a 
trowel. 

Tandy was composedly replac- 
ing the wooden wall with one 
of fieldstone. 

“Tandy! Why, I never . who 
taught you to do this?” 



“I asked Mr. Holmes-the-gym- 
teacher.” (Tandy’s teachers’ 
names were all compound like 
this.) 

“But — but . where did you 
get the concrete?” 

“I boughted it. I saved my ’low- 
ance money and all my ice-cream 
money. That’s all right, isn’t it? 
I didn’t go into town, Robin did 
on his bicycle.” She slopped 
water from a toy sand-bucket and 
began to mix the concrete. 

“Robin never told me,” said 
the mother faintly. 

“I guess you never asked him. 
Mommy.” 

“I guess I never.” The mother 
wet her lips. “Tandy, how did 
you ever think of all this?” 

“I didn’t think of it. I just did 
it, that’s all.” She picked up a 
slather of cement and ladled it 
on to the top course of her new 
wall. “You wouldn’t expect a 
brownie to go on living in a ol’ 
wood house, now, would you?” 
she demanded in grandmotherly 
tones. 

“No, I — I suppose not . 
Tandy, I saw the dresser and the 
little chair and the tablecloth. 
They’re lovely. Tandy, did some- 
one iron the tablecloth for you?” 
“Oh, it irons itself,” said Tandy. 
“You wash it an’ rinse it and stick 
it on a window an’ when it’s 
dry it’s ironed.” 

“What’s that lovely white 
floor?” 



TANDY'S STORY 



185 



'^ANDY selected and hefted a 
stone, then carefully laid it 
on the course. “Borax,” she said. 

“And you bought that with 
your ice-cream money too?” 
“Sure. Brownies like borax and 
the little lumps off roots and that 
stuff there.” She pointed to the 
rows of dark-green weed. 

“What is that?” 

“The brownie’s farm.” 

“I mean, the plant.” 

“I don’t know what the real 
name is. I found it through the 
woods there, there’s a whole 
patch. I call it brownie spinach. 
Look, over there’s the lump®. It’s 
like candy to a brownie.” She 
pointed to a heap of roots, from 
some legume or other — the 
mother couldn’t tell, for the leaves 
were gone; but the root-hairs had 
clusters of the typical nitrogenous 
nodules. “Tandy, how on earth do 
you know so much about brown- 
ies?” 

Tandy gave her an impish 
glance. “I guess the same way 
you know about little girls.” 

The mother laughed. “Oh, but 
I had little girls of my own!” 
Tandy just nodded: “Mm-hm.” 
The mother laughed again. 
When she left Tandy was fitting 
a whiskey-bottle — the three-sided 
“pinch” bottle — full of water, 
into the wall she was building, 
taking infinite pains to have it 
slant just so. 

The mother wasn’t laughing. 



though, later when she told her 
husband about it. As such 
things occasionally do, these 
developments had come about 
invisibly to him, having shown 
themselves mostly when he was 
away during the day. He listened, 
frowning thoughtfully, and when 
the children were glued to the 
television set the parents went 
out to look at the brownie house. 
All he said — all he could find to 
say, over and over, was: “Well, 
how about that.” 

When they left he snapped off 
a sprig of the dark green weed 
and put it in his pocket. 

“And she sets the table every 
night,” breathed the mother. 

A FTER she finished the field- 
stone house (even the roof 
was stone, laid over the plywood 
from which the mossy earth had 
been swept away) Tandy seemed 
to abandon the brownie and his 
house altogether. She went back 
to one of her earlier passions, 
modelling clay, and spent her 
time studiously working it. But 
not ducks, not elephants. She 
would make thick rectangular 
slabs of it, and draw, or score, 
deeply into it. Some of the chan- 
nels she cut were deeper than 
others, some curved, some straight 
but cut with her stylus at an 
acute angle, so that portions were 
undercut. “Looks like a three- 
dimensional Mondrian,” said the 



186

father one night when the kids 
were asleep. He worked in a 
museum and knew a great many 
things, and had access to a great 
many more. That plant, for ex- 
ample. “It’s astralagus vetch” he 
told his wife. “And I knew I’d 
read something about it some- 
where, so I looked it up again. 
It’s a pretty ordinary sort of 
vegetable except for some reason 
it has a fantastic appetite for 
selenium. So much so that pro- 
posals have been made to mine 
selenium — and you know, that’s 
that light-sensitive element they 
use in TV tubes and photocells 
and the like — by planting the 
vetch where selenium is known 
to be in the soil, harvesting the 
whole plant, burning it and re- 
covering selenium from the ash. 
All of which is beside the point 
— what on earth made the little 
fuzzhead pick the stuff up and 
plant it?” 

“Brownies like it,” the mother 
said, and smiled. 

It was the very next morning 
that Tandy was missing from 
the breakfast table. 

There was only a small flurry 
about it; the mother knew just 
where to look. The child was 
busily packing armloads of vetch 
and tangles of knobby roots into 
a hole in the solid front of the 
brownie house. The brownie him- 
self sat against the garage, its 
face turned toward her, its not- 



closed, not-open eyes seeming to 
watch. “I’m sorry. Mommy,” 
Tandy said brightly, “but I’m not 
late for school, am I?” 

“No, dear, but your breakfast 
is ready. What on earth are you 
doing to the brownie’s house?” 
“It isn’t a house any more,” 
said Tandy, in the tones of one 
explaining the self-evident to one 
who should know better without 
asking, “it’s a factory.” She put 
both hands in the hole and pushed 
hard. Apparently the house was 
baled full of weeds and roots. 
She daubed mortar around the 
opening quickly. 

“Come, dear.” 

“Just finished. Mommy.” She 
took a flat stone and set it into 
the opening, which must have 
been prepared for it, for it seemed 
a perfect fit. Another slap of 
mortar and she was up smiling. 
“I’m sorry. Mommy, but this is 
the day I had to do that.” 

“For the brownie.” 

“For the brownie.” They went 
back to the house. 

TN HAWAII, a specialist, who 
should have been but was not 
more than a sergeant at the mis- 
sile tracking station, grunted and 
straightened away from the high 
definition screen. “Lost it.” He 
pulled a tablet toward him, 
glanced at the clock, and started 
filling in the log.

streak as the satellite died. But if 
there had been a witness to that 
death — placed not to see faint 
swift streaks, but right on the 
scene, with a high-speed strobo- 
scopic viewing device, he would 
have had some remarkable pic- 
tures. 

As the golden sphere surren- 
dered to the ravening attack of 
frictional heat, in that all but im- 



measurable fragment of time 
wherein its parts became malle- 
able, plastic, useful — they were 
used. Selenium from the solar 
cells, nitrogen from the pres- 
surized interior, borosilicates 
ripped from refractory parts, 
were gleaned and garnered and 
formed and conformed. For a 
brief time (but quite long 
enough) there existed a device of

molten alloy bars and threads 
surrounding a throat, or gate, 
which was composed of a pulsing, 
brilliant blue non-substance. 

An3Tthing placed within this 
blue area would cease to exist — 
not destroyed in any ordinary 
sense, but utterly eliminated. And 
the laws of the universe being 
what they are, such eliminated 
matter must reappear elsewhere 



Exactly where, depends of course 
on circumstances. 

^^HAT morning the mother was 
-*■ hanging clothes when a flash 
of light caught her eye. She put 
down her clothes-basket and 
went to the back of the garage. 

The brownie sat with his 
back to the garage, staring 
glumly at the torn-up remnants 
of his “farm.” The midmorn- 
ing sunlight, warm and bright 
in this clear dry day, struck 
down through a gap in the trees 
and poured itself on and over 
the pinch bottle, half in and half 
out of the near wall of the little 
house. The colors were, she found 
by screening her vision through 
her eyelashes, lovely and very 
bright — flame-orange and white 
— why, the bottle itself seemed to 
be alight. 

Or was it the inside of the 
little house? 

There was a violent, sudden 
hiss as the bottle, full of water, 
popped its cork and sent a gout 
of water inside the little stone 
structure. Steam rolled up and 
then disappeared, and she took a 
pace back from the sudden wave 
of heat. Terrified, she began to 
think of hose, of extinguisher . 
the garage, all these trees, the 
house . and then she saw that 
the side of the brownie’s house 
which adjoined the wooden gar- 
age was fieldstone too. The hear. 



TANDY'S STORY 



189 



whatever it was, was contained. 

It seemed to diminish a little. 
Then the glass bottle wavered, 
softened, slumped and fell inside. 
Heat blasted out again, and again 
diminished. 

She stepped closer and peered 
down through the hole left by 
the bottle. She could clearly see, 
lying on the floor of the stone 
chamber, the clay slab Tandy 
had made, with its odd, geome- 
trical system of ditches and scor- 
ings. But they seemed filled with 
some quivering liquid, which 
even as she watched turned from 
yellow to silver and then dulled 
to what could only be called a 
chalky pewter. The lines and 
ditches, filled with this almost- 
metal, made a sort of screen, but 
not exactly. It was too tangled 
for that. Say an irregular frame 
about an irregular opening in 
the center of the slab. And this 
center area began to turn blue 
and then purple, and then throb 
in some way she would never 
be able to describe. She had to 
turn her eyes away. 

Looking away seemed to snap 
the thread of fascination with 
which she had leashed fear. She 
fled to the house, dialed the 
telephone, got her husband. 
“Quick,” she said, and stopped to 
pant, alarming him mightily. 
“Come home.” 

It was all she could manage. 
She hung up and sank into a 



couch. She was therefore un- 
aware of Noel, who came trotting 
across the back of the house and 
straight and fearlessly behind the 
garage. She stood for a while 
with a red lollipop in her mouth 
and pink hands behind her, watch- 
ing the heat-flickers over the 
stones, then circled them care- 
fully to windward and squatted 
down where she could peer in- 
side. Carefully then, and much 
more steadily than even a deft 
three-year-old might be expected 
to move, she reached down with 
her delicate lollipop and probed 
the molten slag. 

don’t, don’t!” the mother 
said later back of the garage, 
as the father stabbed angrily at 
the hot stones with a crowbar. 
“Tandy might . she might . 
oh, it’s meant so much to her . .” 
“I don’t care, I don’t care,” 
he growled, stabbing and slash- 
ing and ruining. “I don’t like it. 
Just say it’s about fire, like play- 
ing with matches. We won’t 
punish her or anything.” 

“No?” she said woefully, look- 
ing at the ruins. 

“And this,” he said, “damn 
devilish thing.” He scooped up 
the brownie and thrust it among 
the scorching rocks. It flamed up 
easily. The last thing to go was 
the pair of dull eyes. The mother 
was at last sure they had been 
open the whole time. “Just tell

her we almost had a fire,” growl- 
ed the father. 

. which was the selfsame day 
Tandy brought back her report 
card, the absolutely perfect re- 
port card, and the note; 

. truly the first absolutely 
perfect report card I have 
ever made out in my twenty- 
eight years of teaching 
school. The change in Tandy 
is quite beyond anything I 
have ever seen. She is an 
absolute delight, and I think 
it safe to say that probably 
she always was; her previous 
behavior was, perhaps, a pro- 
test against something which 
she has now accepted. I shall 
never be able to express my 
gratitude to you for coming 
in for that talk, nor my ad- 
miration of you for your 
handling of the child (what- 
ever that was!) It might be 
gracious of you to say that 
perhaps I had something to 
do with this; I would like 
to forestall that compliment. 

I did nothing special, nothing 
extra. It is you who have 
wrought the most pleasant 
kind of miracle. 

It was signed by her teacher, 
and it left them numb. Then the 
mother kissed Tandy and ex- 
claimed, “Oh darling, whoever in 
the world magicked you?” 



Exclamation or no, Tandy 
took it as a question and answer- 
ed it directly: “The brownie.” 

There was a heavy silence, and 
then the mother took Tandy’s 
hand. “You have to know about 
something,” she said, and un- 
gently to the father, “You come 
too.” 

They went out behind the gar- 
age, the woman touching Tandy’s 
shoulders with ready mother 
hands. “There was a fire, honey. 
It all burned up. The brownie 
burned too.” 

The father, watching Tandy’s 
face, which had not changed at 
the sight of the ruin (was this 
that un-seeing you read about, 
when people in shock deny to 
themselves what they see?) said 
suddenly and hoarsely, “It was 
an accident.” 

“No, it wasn’t,” Tandy said. 
She looked at her father and her 
mother but they were both look- 
ing at their feet. “And anyway, 
he isn’t burned up, he wasn’t in 
that fire.” 

“He was,” said the father, but 
she ignored him. “Anyway,” the 
mother said, “I’m terribly sorry 
about your pretty little house, 
Tandy.” 

Tandy poked out her lips 
briefly. “It wasn’t a house, it was 
a factory, I told you,” she said. 
“And anyway it’s all finished with 
anyway.” 

“You better understand,” said 



TANDY'S STORY

the father doggedly, “that brownie 
did burn.” 

“You remeiiiber. You left him 
sitting right there,” said the 
mother. 

“Oh,” said Tandy, “that wasn’t 
a brownie! You can’t see a 
brownie, silly. I’ve got the 
brownie. Don’t you know that? 
Didn’t you see the ’port card?” 

“How did the . .” She couldn’t 
say it. 

“It was easy. Any time I got 
to do something, I think about 
should I or not, and if I should, 
how I should do it; when I think 
of the right way, something in- 
side here goes bwoop-eee!” (she 
made a startlingly electronic 
sound, the first syllable glissad- 
ing upward and the second fiat 
and unmusical, like a “pure” tone) 
“and I know that’s what I should 
do. It’s easy. And that’s the 
brownie.” 

“Inside you.” 

“Mm-hm. That dirty old doll, 
that was just a way to get some 
fun out of all that hard work. I 
couldn’t’ve done it without having 
some sort of fun. So I made it 
easy for brownies to live in this 
whole world and they make it 
easy for me.” 

The mother thought about a 
metallic twisted thing with a pur- 
ple mystery atremble in it. It was 
like looking through a window 
into a — another place. Or a door. 

“Tandy,” she said, moved as 



she sometimes was by sheer im- 
pulse, “how many brownies came 
through the door?” 

“Four,” said Tandy blithely, 
and began to skip. “One for me, 
one for Robin, one for Noel and 
one for the baby. Could I have 
some juice?” 

They walked back to the house. 
Robin was home. He was giving 
Noel back her lollipop and say- 
ing “Thank you” the way they 
always wished he would. Noel 
always was a generous child. She 
had already given the baby a lick. 

^^HE analogy of the profit-shar- 
ing plan appears as we imag- 
ine a self-satisfied tycoon at his 
desk and a bright-eyed junior 
exec sprinting in bearing mimeo- 
graphed sheets. “Gosh, J. G., this 
is the first look I had at the new 
plan. You’re doing a lot for your 
people here, J. G., a whole lot.” 
And homiletically the great man 
inclines his head, accepting the 
tribute, and says “A happy worker 
is a loyal worker, my boy.” And 
while bobbing his head, the junior 
executive is thinking, “Yeah, and 
what’s good for the happy workers 
is good for management, how 
about that?” 

Yet enlightened and coopera- 
tive self-interest is not always to 
be sneered at. Ask any symbiote. 
Whatever it was that bubbled up 
out of that blue orifice had been 
designed simply and solely to 



192 



GALAXY 



adapt a host fully to its environ- 
ment, in order to induce that car- 
dinal harmony called — joy. 

Not satisfaction, not content- 
ment, not pleasure. These can be 
had in other ways, and by using 
less than all of the environment. 
A surge of joy within the host 
created that special substance on 
which the symbiote fed, and it 
was as simple as that. Oh happy 
worker. Oh happy management . 

“Well, thank God anyway she’s 
back to normal,” said the father. 
He came in from the porch where 
he and the mother had stood 
watching the neighborhood kids 
and Robin and Tandy playing on 
the lawn. The mother did not 
point out to him that Tandy, in 
and of the whole group now, 
may have been plajdng normally, 
but she wasn’t back to it; she’d 
come to it. The mother stood 
watching, silent, happy, and 
frightened. 

Inside, the father picked up 
his newspaper and threw it down 
again when he heard one of those 
special in-group code sounds 
which come to families like secret 
cyphers. This one was the click 
of heavy glass against hardwood, 
and meant that the baby, who 
had been put down in the crib 
in the master bedroom, had 
lashed out with a strong left 
hook in his random way and 
belted his bottle out of his mouth 
and up against the crib bars. 



The father stopped just inside 
the bedroom. His jaw dropped, 
and all he could do was slowly 
to raise a hand to his chin and 
close it and hold it closed. For 
the baby, the six-months-old 
Timothy, who only yesterday 
could hopelessly lose a bottle 
five-eighths of an inch away from 
his hungry face, pulled himself 
to a sitting position by the bars, 
half-turned to the left and pulled 
the pillow on which the bottle 
had been perched away from the 
side of the crib and up to a 
formal position across the end of 
the mattress; half-turned to the 
right to grasp the bottle, then lay 
back. 

He not only took the bottle 
firmly in his two hands; he not 
only got his mouth on it; he also 
elevated it so it would flow freely. 

And for a long moment there 
was no sound but his suckings, 
his rhythmic murmurs of sheer 
joy, and the faint susurrus of tiny 
bubbles valving back into the 
bottle; for the father was holding 
his breath. At last the father in- 
haled and opened his mouth to 
call his wife witness to this mir- 
acle. He then thought better of 
it, closed his mouth, wagged his 
head and quietly left the room. 

As he entered by one door, 
Robin, the firstborn, bounded in 
at the front. The screen door 
went to the stretch, and uncorked 
a curve that promised to tear out 



TANDY'S STORY

the moldings when it hit. The 
father squinched up his face and 
eyes in preparation for the crash, 
but Robin, for the first time in 
his life — a boy has to be at least 
eleven before he stops slamming 
screen-doors, and Robin was only 
eight — Robin reached behind him 
without looking and buffered the 
door with his fingertips, so it 
closed with a whisper and a click. 
He galloped past the unthunder- 
struck father and went into the 
kitchen; a moment later he was 
seen, all unbidden, lugging the 
garbage out. 

The father fell weakly back 
into the big wicker chair. 

FORE 

Cordwainer Smith is one sci- 
ence-fiction writer who made his 
mark strictly on quality, not 
quantity, because up to now the 
quantity has been, as any con- 
noisseur knows, far too small. It’s 
a pleasure to know that he has 
got down to work and the quan- 
tity is on the increase — and 
quality, if anything, better than 
ever! We’ve got him firmly 
pinned down for the June Galaxy 
with a story which elucidates a 
simple three-part law: Poor com- 
munications deter theft; good 
communications promote theft; 
perfect communications stop 
theft. 

That’s the idea behind the 
story. The way Cordwainer 
Smith fleshes it out is what 



“Daddy . .” 

He put down his paper. Noel 
came to him with a long card- 
board box stretching her three- 
year-old arms out almost straight. 
She plead, “You wanna play chest 
with me?” 

He looked at her for a long 
moment. Many times they had 
sat on the carpet and made sol- 
dier-parades with the chessmen. 
But now he — he ... 

He shuddered. He tried to con- 
trol it but he couldn’t. “No, 
Noel,” he said. “I don’t want to 
play chest with you . .” But oh, 
that’s Noel’s story, not Tandy’s.

makes a first-rate novelette out 
of our forthcoming Mother Hit- 
ton’s Littul Kittons. (Yes, that’s 
the way it’s spelled!) 

What else? More than we 
have space to say! There’s Mack 
Reynolds with a long novelette 
called Farmer — Frank Herbert 
with one called A-W-F Unlimited 
— maybe another novelette — 
and the usual lineup of fea- 
tures . 

And among the shorts one at 
least that deserves a special 
word: A Gentle Dying, by Fred- 
erik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth. 
Kornbluth’s death broke up one 
of the finest writing teams in 
science fiction. This may be the 
last time that familiar double 
by-line will appear in Galaxy.
