THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE by JAMES BLISH 




Could you write 
for television? 

ByMaxShulman 



X rankly, T don’t know. But this I do know: 
when I was running the Dobie Gillis show, 
I often paid $2,500 and more for scripts 
turned out by people who should have been 
arrested for impersonating writers. 

How such people got to be high-priced 
TV writers is not as mysterious as it seems. 
Television is an insatiable maw into which 
scripts must be fed at a rate unprecedented 
in the history of entertainment. It is a grate- 
ful producer indeed who consistently gets 
scripts which have been written with real 
understanding of television’s powers and 
limitations. 

To help train new TV writers, I joined 
with Rod Serling (creator of The Tw ilight 
Zone, winner of five Emmy Awards) and 
ten other leading authors* to start the 
Famous Writers School. We pooled every- 
thing we had learned in our long years in the 
business to devise four professional writing 
courses that men and women, seriously in- 
terested in writing, could take in their own 
homes in their free time. 

How to write “with a lens” 

All four of our courses give you a solid 
foundation in basic writing skills. And three 
of them (Fiction, Non-Fiction and Adver- 
tising) give you training in the techniques 
of television. You learn to build interesting, 
believable characters; how to write dialogue 
that rings true; how to plot convincingly. 
Theif you develop the specialized approach 
that TV demands: the facility to tell your

story (or documentary or commercial) in 
quick, visual sequences . the knack of 
thinking and writing with a lens! 

Through a series of carefully planned 
assignments, you learn as you write— guided 
by our own specially organized textbooks. 
Your assignments are painstakingly edited 
and revised by our staff of instructors, them- 
selves all professional writers. Under our 
supervision, an instructor works with you 
by mail, much as a producer or editor works 
with an established writer. 

Do you have an aptitude for writing? 

To help you (and us) decide whether you’ve 
got the stuff to be a writer, we have worked 
up a revealing aptitude test. The coupon 
below will bring you a copy, along with a 
4S-page School brochure. If your test indi- 
cates aptitude, you are eligible to enroll in 
the School. You are, however, under no ob- 
ligation to do so.

IF • Editorial 



CHEER UP. FELLOWS! 



Readers, Tou’re exempted from 
reading editorial — yon needn’t 
take notes and there will be no foiz. 
It's the writers we'd like to talk 
to this time. 

Fellows, how about if in our peer- 
ing into the crystal ball that we 
use for a typewriter, we try to 
see something a little more inter- 
esting and constructive for a while? 
After all, we're not limited to the 
probable future. Anybody can write 
about that. Heaven knows it's a 
temptation to look at the going 
population trends and come up with 
a world of a trillion people breath- 
ing in each other's armpits, eating 
pressed algiae and dreaming of 
the annual vacation when they can 
hope to have a sight of a real tree. 
Or the arms race and the rumblings 
of war can make it rather likely 
that underpopulation is more like- 
ly to be a problem than over, and 
it's pretty easy to project a world 
where bearded savages howl in the 
crumbling canyons of Wall Street. 

We're not suggesting that science- 
fiction writers should stick their 
heads in the sand and write a sort 
of 28th-century Pollyanna. We're 
suggesting something quite differ- 
ent. 

We're suggesting that if you don't 
like the looks of the future, a very 
good kind of story to write — and 
one that we get all too seldom — is 
the story of how the people of day 
after tomorrow learn how to avoid, 
prevent, terminate and/or cure 
whatever we think is going to be 
wrong. 



John ]L Pierce says: There is 
only one intiiTe when it comes; the 
only chance we have to consider 
alternate futures is now, when we're 
still not sure which one will turn 
up. 

It's even possible that by see- 
ing the disasters that Ue ahead — 
and by shewing what can be done 
about them — a few people today 
can take some sort of part in help- 
ing to avoid them. Maybe even a 
few science-fiction writers! 

And if that’s too much to 
ask — well, at least it will be 
more fun for all of us if we think 
in terms of what can be done, 
rather than what will be done to 
us. 



A ll right, readers, you can come 
back in now. 

If you've been paying atten- 
tion, you've noticed that If tries to 
avoid the Gloom & Doom kind of 
story . not because we don't un- 
derstand Great Art or because our 
middle name i^ Pangloss, but simp- 
ly because most of them strike us 
as being inordinately dull. We don't 
demand happy stories. Some of our 
favorites have wound up with the 
characters we loved best either dead 
or doomed. But there's a great dif- 
ference between drama and despair 
. and so many of the stories we 
read (and reject!) are simply 
despairing. 

If that's Great Art — we'll take 
The Master Mind of Mara! 

— The Editor

THE 

HOUR by JAMES BLISH 

BEFORE 




Illustrated by MORROW 



Dolph always wanted to go to Mars. 
Now he had a vehicle that could 
take him there — his tree house/ 

I 

THE TREE HOUSE 

D alph Haertel — even now that 
he was eighteen, nobody who 
knew him risked calling him Adolph,

except his father — took a quick 
last look at the free-floating needle 
in the middle of the table. Then 
he launched himself across the floor 
of his packing crate to the port- 
hole, for his first close view of 
Mars. 

The view wasn’t particularly good. 
For one thing, the bullseye was dou- 
ble. He had bought it originally as 
raw material for a telescope mirror, 
and because the walls of the pack- 
ing crate were also double, he had 
been forced to use both blanks 
to make a single porthole. The re- 
sult was rather like looking down 
at Mars through a short tunnel, six 
inches in diameter, with an inch- 
thick pane of slightly scratched 
crown glass at each end. 

In addition, the glare was blind- 
ing. Even at only a little beyond 
one hundred miles above the plan- 
et’s surface, Dolph was still ef- 
fectively outside the Martian atmos- 
phere, and between the sharp steel- 
blue glare of the gas horizon and 
the red-tinged lemon shimmering of 
the noonday desert, details were al- 
most as washed out as they were 
in the best Palomar photographs. 

Nevertheless, as Dolph fell slow- 
ly toward the desert south of the 
area called the Sinus Sabaeus, a 
regular triangle of dark blue-green 
streaks, narrowing from the Sinus 
through the desert toward the 
“oasis” named (most fancifully) 
Arabia, gradually took on better 
and better definition. He watched 
them grow, hardly daring to breathe. 
These dark, impossibly straight lines 
were major examples of the Martian 
mystery long referred to as “canals,” 



though nothing could be more cer- 
tain than, that they were not canals 
in any Earthly sense. Were they 
volcanic fault lines? Animal trails? 
Something made by intelligent life, 
perhaps millions of years ago? Or 
just illusions, put together from tiny 
details by an eye straining for a 
regular pattern across millions of 
miles of space emptiness? 

But these canals were not fading 
away as the packing crate settled. 
On the contrary, they, were becom- 
ing sharper every minute. From up 
here — for Dolph was close enough 
to think of the diminishing gap as 
a height, rather than a distance — 
his eye could already resolve de- 
tails smaller than fifty kilometers 
across, so that he could have seen 
a Sicily or even a Long Island, had 
Earth’s areographers been whimsical 
enough to put one on the map of 
Mars. And still the canals showed 
no signs of dissolving into a welter 
of background markings, as a pro- 
per optical illusion should. Instead, 
their linearity became steadily more 
definite, their edges sharper and 
more inarguable as he descended. 

No, the canals of Mars were real. 
And before the next hour was over, 
Dolph Haertel was going to become 
the first human being in history to 
know without doubt just what they 
were. 

D olph touched a bared copper 
end of a wire to a B battery 
terminal and watched the needle 
floating above the center of the 
breadboard rig begin to turn slow- 
ly and uncertainly. Outside his tree- 
house, spring winds moved gently in

IF 




the Iowa night, but the needle paid 
as little attention to them as it did 
to any other force of the massive 
and turning Earth. For the needle, 
the breadboard was all of the uni- 
verse that there was. 

At the age of eighteen, Dolph 
Haertel had discovered anti-gravity. 

Dolph was wholly aware of the 
fantastic importance of what he 
had found, but the discovery did 
not seem as unlikely to him as it 
would have to, say, his father — 
or for that matter, to a theoretical 
physicist who had spent a lifetime 
studying the mysterious metrical 
frame of space-time, that invisible, 
tyrannical grid which confined the 
courses of spiral nebulae and falling 
stones alike. Indeed, the discovery 
seemed inevitable to him now, at 
least in -the light of hindsight. 

At the very least, better than 
half a dozen accidents seemed to 
have conspired to lead him toward 
it. And for seeing it when he at 
last happened upon it, he was fully 
prepared to take credit if asked, 
for a great deal of reading in the 
history of science had convinced 
him of the truth of Pasteur’s first 
law of research: “Chance favors 
only the prepared mind.” 

The preparation had inhered first 
of all in a natural bent for mathema- 
tics — part of it doubtless only that 
gift that exists in every child until 
it is suppressed or poisoned by the 
schools; part of it perhaps inherited 
from his mother, who was a govern- 
ment bacteriologist at NASA’s Cen- 
ter for Xenobiology at the State Uni- 
versity of Iowa in nearby Iowa City. 
Certainly little of it could have de- 



scended from his foster father, who 
was a grain-elevator salesman whose 
“head for figures” — to use Mrs. 
Haertel’s affectionate description — 
“comes to a point at business arith- 
metic.” 

Then, too, there had been the 
fact that his natural bent was rather 
solitary. Even outdoors it^ leaned 
toward hikes and fishing rather than 
team sports like baseball, which he 
found acutely dull. This was fur- 
thered by a boyhood isolation im- 
posed from outside. His foster father 
spent much of his time “on the 
road” — which was as likely to take 
him to Manitoba or the Punjab as it 
was to any of the American bread- 
basket states — and as a govern- 
ment worker in the space sciences 
his mother was subject to transfers 
of base upon short notice, or no 
notice at all. Hence, although the 
suburban house in Iowa’s low, roll- 
ing green hills was spacious and the 
countryside altogether pleasant, 
Dolph never was tempted into the 
mistake of thinking of it as “home”. 
He had never had one, and did not 
particularly feel the lack; and he 
had never been thrown among any 
group his own age long enough to 
form a firm friendship which might 
have drawn his attention outward 
from his own thoughts and the read- 
ing which chiefly nourished them. 

Lately, it was true, he had taken 
more and more to noticing that the 
human beings in the world were 
divided into two sorts, one of which 
seemed softer and inarguably was 
more difficult to talk to than the 
other. One of these, a disturbing 
Canadian blonde — black hair and 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



9 




blue eyes — named Nanette Ford, 
had even shown an astonishing com- 
prehension of what Dolph was up 
to now, so much so that for a while 
he had hoped she might share the 
grand adventure itself. But more 
and more it had come to seem to 
him that the risks were too great. 
Besides, in a venture with so many 
unknowns, the including of a sec- 
ond party — and that a girl! — 
would be the least manageable un- 
known of all, and the most avoid- 
able. 

T he final and most crucial stroke 
of luck had come when he was 
fourteen, and already beginning to 
turn himself, without being aware 
of it, into an attic inventor — per- 
haps one of the last of the breed, 
in a world dominated by team re- 
search costing sums only govern- 
ments could afford to risk or could 
hope to raise. (The attic itself was 
out, for despite his mother’s inter- 
vention, Rolph’s foster father could 
not be swayed from the notion that 
all forms of experimentation in- 
volved explosions, or at least a 
risk of fire. But he was allowed 
to work in the top of the garage. 
Dolph carefully did not point out 
that when both cars were in it, the 
garage was almost as costly an edi- 
fice as the house. His conscience 
was quite .clear about it, since his 
plans included no explosions, nor 
even so much as a lighted match.) 

Instead, he had four years ago 
blundered upon a brief mathemati- 
cal paper in Nature, that most Brit- 
ish and yet most universal of all 
scientific journals, which had turned 



out to have a bearing on the mystery 
of gravity — a mystery abandoned 
by most physicists long ago, since 
the prevailing Einstein cosmography 
ruled firmly that nothing could be 
done about gravity but endure it, 
time without end. Since at fourteen 
Dolph had not yet had enough time 
to decide that any scientific ques- 
tion could be closed or any theory 
sacrosanct, he set out to run down 
all other existing papers on the sub- 
ject, and to keep his eye out for 
new ones. 

His motives for this were not 
entirely imbedded in intellectual cur- 
iosity. Through his mother, he was 
closer than most laymen to the U. S. 
space effort, and better able to see 

— as he did without difficulty — 
what an enormously expensive blind 
alley it was becoming. Project Apol- 
lo, the American effort to make a 
manned landing on the Moon, had 
already consumed billions of dollars 
and still was utterly bogged down, 
its timetable advanced again and 
again and becoming more difficult 
to believe with each postponement. 
Even simple unmanned rocket shots 
did not seem to be gaining much in 
reliability, though they certainly 
never failed to be more costly than 
their predecessors. Wasn’t there 
some more sensible way to go 
about the whole thing? 

Apparently not. And yet the spec- 
tacle offend^ Dolph. He was whol- 
ly susceptible to the vast romance 
inherent — though not yet realized 

— in space travel, and it seemed 
to him that the way the world was 
going about prosecuting it was cra- 
zy; or, at least, that the people in 



10 



IF 




charge had lost sight of the pri- 
mary goal, which was to get out 
into space. Instead, the whole world 
seemed to be spending itself blind 
on more and more expensive rockets 
— not because these brute-force en- 
gineer’s toys were the best way 
to cross interplanetary space (that 
question apparently hadn’t even been 
raised), but because it was a useful 
substitute for the arms race that 
had kept the now-obsolete Cold War 
going. Apparently taxpayers could 
still be sold spaceships — even 
dud ones — where they could no 
longer be sold missiles. \ 

All right. Dolph knew he wasn’t 
competent to question the politics 
of it, nor indeed was he much in- 
terested in that side of it. He was 
interested in space travel itself, and 
he was too young to be convinced 
that rockets were the only possible 
devices that could free man of the 
Earth. It occurred to him that if 
gravity was the chief enemy of 
spaceflight, then something might 
be gained by studying the enemy, 
no matter how hopeless Relativity 
declared such a study would turn 
out to be. 

T he outcome was that at eighteen 
Dolph had become an amateur 
expert in a field so new that few 
physicists even knew it existed, and 
most would say could not exist. 

For all its formidable reputation. 
Relativity had turned out to be 
absurdly easy to master — a discov- 
ery which had been made over and 
over again by everyone with any 
feeling for the poetry of math — 
and full of absurdly large holes in 



both its reasoning and its appeals 
to evidence. British scientists in par- 
ticular, it turned out, had been 
shooting holes in poor old Einstein 
for more than a decade. One espe- 
cially drastic English astronomer, a 
mystical don named Milne, had 
produced a competing form^of Rela- 
tivity that swallowed Einstein’s like 
a goat. Milne had died nearly 
twenty years before Dolph’s birth, 
but he was not forgotten — not in 
a suburb of Iowa City, anyhow. 

Dolph doodled with Milne, and 
Dingle, and the pitifully few others 
who had had the courage to keep 
on thinking about gravity, and, Slav- 
ing been born into precisely the 
right moment, and having brought 
precisely the right mind to the right 
opportunity, fell into the fundamen- 
tal discovery that although gravity 
is (as Einstein had maintained) a 
condition of space rather than a 
force like electricity, it has polarity 
(which Einstein had broken his 
heart trying to disprove). 

It followed naturally that it could 
be manipulated, probably without 
too much work. Since it was a weak 
field to begin with, and worked 
best only over very long distances, 
only a little effort should be re- 
quired to produce desirable vector 
effects — 

Or, that is, working with gravity 
rather than against it could prob- 
ably be done in a garage, with only 
a few dollars. For example: A 

model space drive, capable of lift- 
ing perhaps a hundred pK>unds or 
more of dead weight, sihould be easy 
to assemble from standard television 
set parts and other components. 



tHE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



n 




With Nanette’s rather distracting 
help, he had assembled a small 
breadboard rig to test at least a 
few small margins of the notion. 
The rig worked only too well. It 
turned out to be well over a hundred 
times as efficient as he had dared 
to hope. In an eternal moment of 
groaning boards and squeaking nails, 
it had cut a whole garage off from 
the Earth and lifted it, both family 
cars included, a good inch off its 
foundations. 

The instant when the power cut 
off and the whole mass thudded 
back into place was even more 
alarming, but it was all that had 
saved garage, Nanette and Dolph. 
He had had the rig plugged into 
a light socket, and the feeder line 
had parted before the frame build- 
ing had pulled quite free of its 
concrete biding. 

Nanette had been frightened, but 
it hadn’t occurred to Dolph to be 
genuinely alarmed until a day lat- 
er, when some of the implications 
of the test began to pile up in his 
imagination. After all, despite his 
miscalculation there had never been 
any real danger that the garage 
would take off for the clouds. It was 
too massive a load for the available 
pvower. Hoisting it and its content 
far enough to snap a BX cable was 
quite incredible enough, without im- 
agining consequences the bread- 
board rig could never have brought 
about^ 

But there were things the bread- 
board rig could do. One of them, 
he realized, was to make possible a 
small but genuine spaceship — so 
small that he could build it himself 



in the back yard, but fully function- 
al all the same. 

W hen that idea come to the 
surface, he was scared. 

And yet — why not? Obviously 
the first manned space journey, 
even to so nearby a target as the 
Moon, was still decades in the 
future for the money-happy engin- 
eers, their brute-force rockets and 
their professionally heroic “astro- 
nauts.” Dolph could see no good 
reason — no good technical reason, 
anyhow — why the breadboard rig 
should not take him to Mars some 
time within a year, provided that 
he could somehow scrounge about 
two hundred dollars . well, call 
it three hundred to be on the safe 
side . and could find the time 
both to do the building job proper- 
ly, and to make the round trip be- 
fore somebody caught him at it 
and forbade his trying it at all. 

It was primarily out of the need 
for disguise that the tree house had 
evolved, much to the satisfaction of 
Mr. Haertel, who though he used 
the outdoors for nothing more 
strenuous than business golf him- 
self, liked to see his adopted son 
get his nose out of books and tackle 
something, anything that was prop- 
erly boyish and outdoorsy. The an- 
cient pear tree in the back yard 
would have been absurdly easy for 
anyone to climb, except possibly for 
somebody who had to try it in a 
wheelchair. But the very fact that 
the tree house was up off the ground 
made it unlikely to be blundered 
into by adults who might find what 
was inside it unexpected enough to 



12 



IF 




prompt questions. As for kids, well, 
there was nobody around of Dolph’s 
own age who would think a tree- 
house anything but too juvenile to 
be worth noticing, except Nanette. 
Younger children could invade it 
whenever they liked, as far as Dolph 
was concerned — there would be 
nothing in it complex enough for 
them to damage, and nothing for 
them to see that they could report 
to older people in any terms which 
would make sense. 

He made a model ship of his first 
packing case, in the ravine with 
which the parcel of land ended at 
the back. He caulked it as carefully 
as though it would some day actual- 
ly need to hold breathable air 
against the malice of a hard vacuum 
— though his limited resources pre- 
vented his giving it a double hull or 
any insulation — and equipped it 
with his first breadboard rig. One 
night, far past midnight, he lifted 
it silently a hundred feet into the 
moonlit air, and just as silently set 
it down again except for a faint 
grating noise as its bottom resettled 
among the heather-hazed rocks of 
the dry stream bed. 

Nobody saw the boxey specter as 
far as he could tell — although the 
neighbor’s dog, a pure-bred cocker 
spaniel with nerves of purest Jello, 
howled all the rest of the night — 
and a week later he felt sure enough 
of the safety of the model to take 
Nanette along for a second cautious 
night ascension. She was breathless 
with excitement, but he took great 
care to make the “flight” as slow 
and solemn as that of a tethered 
balloon, and to avoid even the faint- 



est hint that there might be more 
to be done with the anti-gravity field 
than this. (And he swore her to 
secrecy on even that much of it.) 

The tree house was not much 
larger than the model, but it was al- 
together more elaborate. He meant 
it to take him into space, and to 
bring him back; he had no intention 
that it should kill him instead, if 
he could possibly avojd that 

The floor of the exterior crate 
went into the tree first, as a plat- 
form (which, like the sides, had 
been sprayed with five layers of 
epoxy resins over the basic caulk- 
ing — a horribly expensive proce- 
dure because he had been forced to 
buy the spray in household-^ize 
aerosol cans from the local super- 
market, for the sake of secrecy). 
Then the interior crate, similarily 
caulked, had been bedded on the 
platform in a nest of rock wool, 
the best he could do in the way 
of insulation (it would at least pre- 
serve some heat balance in space, 
though against hard radiation it 
would be worse than useless), and 
set about preparing his entrance 
lock and his porthole. 

The problems of supply had to 
be ducked, for the most part. He 
could not afford to buy, and he 
would not have the space to carry, 
more than a token ration of food, 
water or oxygen — especially oxy- 
gen, which came in expensively 
heavy steel bottles which had to 
be cracked by expensive heavy ap- 
paratus. Instead, he bought his oxy- 
gen by the 22-liter flask from the 
local drug store, in the form of a 
gaseous patent medicine put on the

market for hypochondriacs who 
were nervous about smog. Again this 
was a sinfully expensive way of at- 
tacking the problem at hand, but 
no other was open to Dolph if dis- 
guise was to be maintained. 

T here was no solution to this 
logistic problem, nor to the 
menace of cosmic rays and the 
solar wind, but that of time. 

The dinosaurs of power and 
money might afford to tackle them 
directly — though they’d been do- 
ing badly at it up to now — but 
for Dolph only speed, evasiveness, 
foreplanning and penury could serve. 
Those were precisely what the anti- 
gravity drive made possible, other- 
wise the whole notion of the trip 
would be no more than a nocturnal 
fantasy. 

The new rig was no longer, 
strictly speaking, a breadboard- 
chassis improvisation, though it was 
spaced out almost as much for ease 
of access. The components, all tran- 
sistorized except for a power tube, 
were now fixed on a heavy table, 
which in turn was firmly bolted to 
both the floor and one wall of the 
crate, and under which was slung 
the most capacious truck battery 
Dolph had been able to buy from 
Sears Roebuck. The small, heavy 
torus which was the source of the 
field was mounted on a post precise- 
ly at the crate’s geometrical center, 
on ^ gymbals from a Navy-surplus 
gyroscope compass. 

The supplies were in; the tree 
house was tight; the rig was work- 
ing; his course was plotted. There 
was no longer any reason to hang 



back. Even his time was accounted 
for, closely enough so that in a little 
while it would start running out. 
There was a four-day weekend com- 
ing up, and through the medium of 
his shopping — which had been too 
extensive to be hidden, though it 
could be disguised — Dolph had let 
it be known that he planned an- 
other solitary camping trip, which 
would run at least one more day 
than the official holiday. Since he 
had accumulated the e;ctra day off 
from school and his marks were 
mostly up to snuff, the plan arous- 
ed no unusual attention. 

Of course Nanette would sus- 
pect something like the truth when 
she saw the tree house gone, but 
he counted on her to keep her own 
counsel about it. As for the adults, 
what they would think of that 
couldn’t be helped. But he was pret- 
ty sure their guesses would be wide 
of the mark. It would probably take 
them two days to look up far enough 
to notice that the packing ‘crate was 
missing — a tree without a crate 
in its branches being so much more 
ordinary a sight than a tree with 
one — and probably they would 
then assume that he’d disassmbled 
it and set it up at a distance. 

His foster father, in fact, was al- 
most sure to say: “After all, it 

couldn’t very well have flown away 
by itself, could it?” 

So that was that. Late that Thurs- 
day night, with no more than a min- 
imum shower of pear leaves and a 
yap of stifled terror from the dis- 
tant cocker, he edged the crate out 
of the ancient tree. 

And promptly at 2207 Sidereal

Time, as the calculations required, 
the packing crate silently became a 
spaceship and vanished, Dolph and 
all. 

II 

THE SEA OF STREAMS 

N o amount of reading of the 
synthetically excited copy about 
orbital flights poured out by the 
popular press — most of it written 
by reporters who had been mock- 
ing the very notion of space flight 
as “that crazy Buck Rogers stuff” 
even after the launching of Sputnik 
I — had prepared Dolph for the 
immense fullness of space. 

He had expected it to be lonely. 
Even the most cursory knowledge 
of the distances which stretched 
around the planets would have fore- 
warned him that the universe of 
night is vast beyond all hope of 
understanding. When the idea of 
making a crossing to Mars had first 
come to him, one of his first 
thoughts had been the sober realiza- 
tion that Columbus in his fragile 
bark had been setting out to jump 
a local puddle compared to the 
audacity of setting sail for Mars 
in a packing crate. 

The Earth itself was only bare- 
ly large enough a vessel to risk in 
space, as the eternal lifelessness of 
the Moon 'preached graphically. The 
stars were suns, but their planets 
only motes in their eternal light. 

But that space itself should truly 
be a sea, unappeasably in motion 
everywhere and charged to bursting 
with restless particles and energies 



in every millimeter of its measure- 
less reaches, was a concept he had 
never encountered (though he might 
have been warned by the physicists’ 
word for the phenomenal universe, 
“plenum”, which means “the full- 
ness”). The impact of the exper- 
ience itself, piled atop the shock 
of actually seeing the Earth be- 
come just another point of light, lost 
amid millions of others — for since 
Dolph chanced to be travelling in 
the Galactic plane, and the posi- 
tion of Mars at the time was on 
the other side of the Earth from 
Shapley Center, the heart of the 
Galaxy, the Earth for him quickly 
was swamped out in the general 
glitter of the Milky Way — was a 
cotnplete shock, and a blackly 
frightening one. 

In his first hour beyond the at- 
mosphere, after he had finished his 
first checkout of his crate and his 
course, he became grimly aware that 
if he were to turn back now he 
might just barely have the great 
good luck to come home alive — 
and never mind the catastrophic 
nonsense of even dreaming of reach- 
ing Mars. 

Nothing but luck could explain 
his having stayed alive this long. 
Outside the packing crate, mostly 
invisible and beyond the detection 
of his few toy instruments, the cur- 
rents of space raged in a storm 
that had been going on for fourteen 
billion years — if indeed it had 
ever had a beginning — and might 
go on raging for another fourteen 
billion, or forever. Sun and star- 
light glared off the aluminum-paint- 
ed hull of his absurd shell, charring 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



15 





the wood underneath steadily and 
implacably, molecule by mol^ule. 
The solar wind — that torrent of 
atomic fragments which extended the 
Sun’s atmosphere out as far as Jupi- 
ter — seethed and reded in the 
magnetic field which was secondary 
to his miniature gravitational pat- 
tern. X-rays from the hearts of 
exploding stars poured through the 
ship, and its pilot too. Cosmic rays 
— the stripped cores of atoms, 
driven at near-light velocities from 
the ultimate synchrotrons of spiral 
galaxies — bulleted past him, most 
of them luckily deflected by his 
field, missiles against which any 
physical shield would have been 
worse than useless. Micro-meteors, 
some few as big as grains of sand, 
scored the paint and pitted the 
porthole; these too were slowed and 

16 



veered away by his shield, and 
those few that got through his out- 
er hull were trapped by his in- 
sulation (although nothing could 
be done about the minute slow 
leaks these produced). 

H e had known about most of 
these things in advance, at least 
in the abstract, and had tried to 
take them into account. He had 
chosen for the flight a period of 
clear solar weather, in a trough of 
the pulsation cycle when no flares 
were expected (though there were 
no guarantees against them, either). 
Against other radiation he counted 
mainly on the protection of speed, 
to keep his dosage down to safe 
levels, since shielding was out of 
the question. With meteors he was 
willing to take his chances. They 

IF 




were not very common beyond 
Earth’s immediate gravitational en- 
velope, and one capable of killing 
him — one, say, as big as a fleck 
of gravel — would find him a small 
and gravitationally unattractive tar- 
get. As for the air, the drug-store 
oxygen bottles were equipped with 
their own masks which he could 
don if the oxygen tension became 
dangerously low — though for loss 
of pressure in the cabin, there was 
no effective precaution but speed 
of transit. 

It had all seemed at least possi- 
ble, if not very reasonable, back in 
the safety of the garage and the 
Iowa spring. In the raging sea of 
streams which was the reality of 
“empty” space, it was death, not 
pear-leaves, that whispered every 
second just outside the jcrate. 



But he was not going to turn 
back now — and most especially if 
he might not make it home alive 
even if he did. 

He had firm objections to being 
killed, but above all he was not 
going to let himself be knocked 
out of the sky for a project he’d 
already given up. All right, he’d 
obviously made a mistake, and a 
fat one — quite big enough to kill 
him. But he’d made it, and he 
was on his way. And that was defi- 
nitely that. 

He tried to keep his mind off 
the universe of whispering blind 
hostility just outside by concentrat- 
ing on the mechanics of his jour- 
ney, but there was really very lit- 
tle to do. His flight plan had been 
the ultimate in simplicity, thanks 
to the fundamental nature of the 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



17 




discovery which had made it possi- 
ble at all: the discovery that gravity 
is not only a structural condition 
in space, as Einstein had postulat- 
ed, but at the same time a part 
of the general field which included 
electricity and magnetism as its 
other aspects (as Einstein had nev- 
er succeeded in proving) and hence 
has polarity — can have its own 
peculiar forms of negative and pos- 
itive poles. 

Knowing only this much — and 
given the slight vector thrust to 
turn it to account — Dolph could 
sling himself and his tree house 
away from the Earth with all the 
initial velocity he could glean from 
Earth’s own centrifugal force, simp- 
ly by shielding himself from his 
planet’s own gravity. He had only 
to be careful how suddenly he did 
it. Once free of the last clinging 
wisps of Earth’s air, he could add 
with the snap of a switch an ac- 
celeration of two gravities — an- 
other sixty-four feet per second, 
every second. He would in effect 
give the packing crate a “like 
charge” to that of the Earth; this 
on top of a velocity imparted by 
coming off the end of a four-thou- 
sand-mile-long sling which all his life 
had been whirling him through 
space at the rate of not much un- 
der a thousand miles an hour (and 
had he started from the equator, it 
would have been greater still) . 

Tavo gravities would not have 
seemed like much of an accelera- 
tion to the rocket masters at Cape 
Kennedy, who were accustomed to 
sweat blood (and money) to crack 
their vehicles up past nine. But two 



gravities applied over several hours 
can build up a much more respect- 
able end-velocity than can nine grav- 
ities achieved in the three or four 
minutes before a rocket blurts out 
the last of its reaction-mass and be- 
comes just another one of the uni- 
verse’s helplessly falling or coast- 
ing objects. And for Dolph, this 
much was for free, or so near 
to it as made no difference. If he 
wanted to add more to it, he could 
reject the Sun’s gravity ^ well, at 
no extra cost but some much more 
complicated calculations. But for a 
crossing as short as the one he 
planned, the gain did not prove to 
be worth the extra brainwork. 

Steering, of course, was none too 
easy, but here again a little vectoring 
returned large dividends. Once the 
Earth’s field was screened out and 
the crate rode free in the sea of 
streams, retreating from the Sun, a 
faint softening of the lines of force 
on the side of the crate toward 

Mars let in a faint tendril of the 
red planet’s own distant tug. Not 
much, only a sort of an urge, but 
enough to start him into a long 

curving fall toward the fleeing 

world. For him, after all, there was 
no place else to fall to. 

T he moment the meters first reg- 
istered that tug, Dolph was able 
to step it up. To double it, in fact. 
By the middle of his second day 
in space he was already slightly 

more than halfway there, and be- 
ginning to stop the Martian attrac- 
tion back down and use the Earth 
as a drag-anchor. 

It was just as well, too. The air 



18 



IF 




in the crate was already thin and 
a little foul, and Dolph was begin- 
ning to feel quite chilly. In addi- 
tion, he felt a little feverish, which 
he hoped was due solely to the fact 
that he had had no sleep, and that 
he hadn’t bothered to provide his 
crude vessel with plumbing. If the 
odd feverishness also meant that 
he had gotten a higher radiation 
dose than he had planned on, there 
wasn’t a thing he could do about 
it. He was lucky — though he tried 
hard not to think about it — to be 
still alive at all. 

But now his stern chase of Mars 
was beginning to show fruits. The 
red spark was getting fatter — not 
larger, exactly, but markedly bright- 
er. From here on out the ballistics of 
the trip would be even simpler. He 
had only to fall, as mindlessly as 
Newton’s apple, and let natural law 
do the rest until it was time to slow 
himself down to a leaf-fall speed. 

Not that it would do to allow 
carelessness or neglect to cancel out 
everything the sea of streams had 
been unable to sweep away from 
him. He had to land safely on Mars; 
he had to live there, for an hour 
or so at the least; and he had to 
get back, with proofs. Otherwise 
he had risked not only his own life 
for nothing, biit also all the love 
and care that had brought him into 
the world, and kept him alive and 
happy until that moment a few 
months ago when he had decided 
to leave it for a while. Even here 
he was not really alone. 

He had brought with him years 
of devotion, centuries of history, 
ages of evolution; and out here, he 



stood for them all, he and his scraps 
of Earth wood and paint and metal, 
of life and curiosity and knowledge. 
He was custodian of all these things, 
not just of his own life. 

Stub of pencil in hand, he studied 
his instruments with minute care, 
and scribbled calculations on the 
wall of the crate. Mars got fatter.- 
The crate got colder. 

By “morning” — though he still 
had been unable to sleep — the air 
was very bad. He had to don the 
oxygen mask, after a last gulp of 
his rations and swallow of water. 
The gas made him feel more alert, 
and a little warmed, too, though 
he knew that that part of it was 
an illusion. Inside the crate the 
light was now quite orange, cast 
in a truncated cone from the port- 
hole from the surface of Mars. 

Now he had to look down, come 
what may. He took a last quick 
measurement from the free-floating 
needle in the middle of his in- 
strument table, and then launched 
himself across the floor of the crate 
to the porthole. He was already so 
used to the effects of free fall 
that he arrived without banging his 
nose more than slightly. 

The view, disappointingly, was 
not good. For one thing, the micro- 
meteorite scratches on the outside 
bull’s eye had gotten worse; and the 
glare was blinding, especially after 
so many hours of star-hazed black- 
ness. But slowly, he got used to it. 

And slowly he began to realize 
what it was that he was seeing: the 
canals. They were not dissolving, but 
becoming more definite as he des- 
cended. He drew in a sharp breath. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



19 




The canals of Mars were real — 
and before the next hour was over, 
he was going to become the first 
of all human beings to know with- 
out doubt just what they were. 

Always providing, of course, that 
he lived through the next hour. 

Ill 

DOWN . AND OUT 

T he oasis toward which he was 
settling, -in the heart of the sub- 
desert called Aeria, was shown on 
his Pic du Midi map but not given 
any name — probably because it 
was one of those Martian features 
which failed to show up from time 
to time, as even larger green areas 
failed to do some summers. It was 
an oval blotch about thirty degrees 
south of the equator, and perhaps 
five hundred miles off the eastern 
“shore” of Syrtis Major. 

It was certainly showing nicely 
this summer. At a guess, Dolph 
would have said it was as big as 
Rhode Island. Five canals converged 
on it, and more were becoming vis- 
ible, like railroad lines converging 
on a city, animal trails leading to 
a water hole — or spaiU^arks 
around a bullet hole in shatterproof 
glass. 

Dolph resisted that last com- 
parison until it was impossible to 
fight it any longer . until, in 
fact, he could see that it was very 
closer to the truth. The nameless 
oasis was an impact crater, like 
Meteor Crater in Arizona, or the 
ringwalls of the Moon. 

The discovery made his heart 



sick, for it instantly made disastrous 
sense of the surface of Mars, map 
and landscape both. Was it possi- 
ble that Mars, too, was a bombard- 
ed and blasted planet, as implacably 
lifeless and hostile as the Moon 
despite its blanket of thin air? True, 
it was not as obviously pocked and 
torn up as the lunar landscape, but 
that might only mean that the winds 
— and the gigantic sandstorms that 
they carried, often big enough to 
be seen all the way from Earth — 
had worn down the oldest and the 
biggest craters and mountain rang- 
es, and smoothed off the others. The 
retreat of the North pK>lar snows in 
the spring had revealed one moun- 
tain range, the Mountains of Mitch- 
ell; and recurrent sharp edges to 
the cloud-patterns had hinted at 
similar ranges elsewhere on the 
planet, even though no shadows of 
such peaks had been seen. 

The roughly circular shapes of 
the northern deserts — ^ Electric 
Eridania, Ausinia, Hellas, Argyre 
— also looked much like the circular 
maria of the Moon, as did such 
smaller southern ones as Isidis Re- 
gio. And here in the packing crate, 
from less than fifteen miles up, 
there was no longer any doubt that 
Mars at some time in its history 
had been the target of vast celestial 
missiles, some of them as big as 
asteroids. The major canals, the 
ones even old Schiaparelli had seen, 
were colossal straight faults in the 
very crust of the planet, where 
whole continental blocks of the sur- 
face had tilted like ice-floes and 
refrozen out of true to the main 
mass. The minor canals — the ra- 



20 



IF 




dialing marks — were spalled cracks 
centered upon the impacts of small- 
er meteors, objects of the size that 
had so devasted the Moon. 

Since the surface of Mars had 
not changed permanently since the 
invasion of the telescope, it seemed 
likely that no such cataclysm had 
hit Mars in more than three hundred 
years. But the same thing might be 
said of the Moon — which did not 
make Earth’s sister world any less 
barren and hopeless. Whenever the 
bombardment had struck Mars, it 
had changed the planet decisively. 
In the sand sample that the first 
unmanned Martian probe had pho- 
tographed there had been many mic- 
roscopic shells, like those of Earthly 
Foraminifera, which showed de- 
cisively that Mars had once had 
seas. They were all gone now. The 
sands of their bottoms blew about 
the planet in the thin gales. Most 
of that water must have poured 
into the fissures opened when the 
great meteors struck, and boiled 
away, to go finally into combina- 
tion with the rock in the form of 
limonite, the hydrated iron oxide 
which in powdered form made up 
the bulk of the Martain sands. Lit- 
tle enough was left to form the 
thin polar icecaps. 

Had therd been any highly or- 
ganized forms of life on Mars then, 
they could not have survived the 
sudden remaking of their whole 
world. If life itself had survived 
at all, it had had to begin all over 
again. Any that survived there now, 
on this very ancient little world, 
must — paradoxically — be very 
primitive, and even genetically al- 



most without memory of the age of 
oceans. 

Mars was still not dead. But what 
life remained must be staging a 
last stand, quite as dramatic as 
Lowell had guessed . but with 
far fewer resources, and with even 
less hope. 

G lumly, Dolph maneuvered his 
clumsy little craft do^n toward 
a landing in the middle of the 
nameless oasis, the blue-green spot 
of life created by the stony monster 
from space that had also helped to 
turn most of Mars into a perma- 
nent desert. He had not expected 
anything better, really, but he had 
had hopes. Now his hopes were 
limited to seeing just how high a 
form of primitive life could manage 
to hang on where properly there 
should be no life at all. 

The tilted ochre tableland spread 
out beneath him, and the rim of 
the crater expanded like an open- 
ing mouth. From a mile above the 
desert surface he was able to see 
the shadows cast by the low rim. 
The inside of the oasis began to 
look first like a bowl, and then more 
like a shallow saucer. 

It was mid-afternoon on the des- 
ert when the packing crate reached 
it, and the low domed peaks of the 
rim — so oddly like the hills of 
eastern Iowa except for their color 
— rose around him. As the floor of 
the crater came to meet him, how- 
ever, he found himself in a sort 
of gentle blue-green twilight; the 
rays of the brilliant but shrunken 
sun did not reach the bottom at this 
hour. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



21 




At last the scene outside the port- 
hole became motionless. Cautiously 
Dolph cut off his field. 

The crate dropped the last few 
feet with a soft, muffled thunk, as 
though it had fallen onto a ntattress. 
Then there was silence. 

He was on Mars. 

The silence continued, indifferent 
and undisturbed. He had been used 
to it in space, because he had ex- 
pected it; but here it was as though 
the planet, bent upon cherishing the 
last of its own life, did not even 
notice his existence. Well, why 
should it? In its long, slow, tor- 
tured life, Dolph was only the ac- 
cident of an instant. 

He shook off his depression and 
set to work. First, the outside temp- 
erature, and the air pressure. 

The resulting readings were hard 
to believe. He took two more of 
each and could hardly trust them 
even after they agreed with the first. 
His equipment wasn’t the 'best. 

But it was the best he had, and 
it said that the temperature out there 
was twenty-five degrees Centigrade, 
or 77° on the obsolete Fahrenheit 
scale the English-speaking peoples 
clung to. That was outright balmy 
— nobody could fairly call it less. 
As for the air pressure — 200 milli- 
bars — it was about equivalent to 
what he would have encountered 
high in the Himalayas, far from 
breatheable even had it contained 
enough oxygen; but even so it was 
better • than twice the pressure he 
could even have hoped to find up 
on the desert. On Mars, it ap- 
peared, it paid to be at the bottom 
of a deep, deep hole. 



In short, he could go outside, 
wearing no more clothing than he 
had on right now, and with no 
protection from the air but the 
respirator. He buckled it on, fol- 
lowed by the canvas belt which held 
the twenty plastic vials which were 
for his samples, and loaded his poc- 
kets. Then he dropped to his hands 
and knees before the tightly caulk- 
ed barrel which was his airlock. 

A few moments later he was out. 

He lost about twenty per cent 
of the Earthly air in the crate in 
the process, but this did not bother 
him. He was not after all, planning 
to stay long. He got to his feet and 
looked about. 

In the indirect sunlight, the vast 
circular valley was so still that it 
was like being on the floor of some 
long-untended aquarium or pond. 
Overhead, the sky was a deep violet, 
almost an indigo, in which he could 
see a scattering of stars, including 
several brilliant ones. He wondered 
if one of those could be the Earth. 
The idea gave him a distinct chill. 

The horizon was near, but not 
bounded by the mountains of the 
ring-wall — in fact, he could not 
even see their peaks; the oasis was 
too big for that. Except for low, 
rolling hills, the crater floor stretch- 
ed away evenly in all directions, an 
almost uniform blue-green, with a 
few chocolate spots. 

He struck a wooden match against 
the crate. Nothing happened, of 
course. 

The blue-green was vegetation; 
he got back down on his hands 
and knees to look at it, then 



22 



IF 




snatched his hands up again. The 
air was warm, all right, but the 
ground was bitter cold even through 
his gloves. He had forgotten that 
the midnight temperatures here 
probably hit 150 degrees below Fah- 
renheit zero during most of the 
year, and could not be much warm- 
er even in high summer. Luckily 
his hiking shoes were heavy, and 
so were his socks, or he’d be risk- 
ing frost-bitten toes just standing 
there. 

The vegetation was curious stuff; 
he found it hard to think of any- 
thing to compare it with. In tex- 
ture it was a little like loosely wov- 
en sponge, the filament either gray, 
greenish or the chocolate brown 
he had noticed, and looking rather 
tough. Interwoven with these were 
more delicate filaments of a lighter, 
more vivid green, which here and 
there were gathered into small knots 
or clumps within holes formed by 
the spongy matrix. 

He pulled at it experimentally. It 
tore readily, a little to his surprise, 
and the fragment of it in his hand 
promptly seemed to shrink, forming 
itself into a rough ball. Similar balls, 
of varying sizes, were scattered 
about him, as though detached by a 
wind. 

Up close tbe sponge had a spec- 
kled appearance, because both kinds 
of filaments bore tiny fruits or 
bladders, he could not decide which. 
Those on the tough filament were 
black or brown like their parents 
and were about the size of B-B 
shot; those on the green strands 
were bigger and elongated, like 
small beans, but were quite trans- 



parent. Suspecting water or some 
sap, Dolph stripped off a glove 
and tried to break one of those sacs 
with thumb and finger nail. But 
though its pellicle yielded, it would 
not break. 

Water on second thought was un- 
likely, since it would freeze in the 
Martian night. But what then Was 
in the clear little bladders? 

He was distracted from 'the ques- 
tion by a sign of movement on his 
bare palm. Startled, he looked clos- 
er. The skin seemed to be crawl- 
ing. 

It was crawling. He was reminded 
at once of what had happened in 
his boyhood when he had picked 
up a wounded robin chick, and had 
afterward discovered that his hand 
was covered with mites, an incident 
which had divested him of all senti- 
mentality toward birds forever. 
These were not mites, but they were 
some Martian equivalent. They were 
about a quarter of an inch long, 
looked quite like some species of 
nematode or roundworm, and there 
were thousands of them. And yes, 
here and there among them were 
genuinely mite-like creatures, black 
arthropods, scuttling among the 
nematodes, or settled quietly on the 
backs of their necks, feeding .... 

He kicked away the sponge around 
him in a hurry until he had exposed 
a patch of powdery red soil, and 
scrubbed both hands in a handful of 
it, cold or no cold. Though he prob- 
ably had no reason to be afraid of 
these tiny spots of Martian animal 
life, he was not going to take any of 
it back into the crate with him — 
and hence back to Earth — if he 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE

could possibly help it. At least, not 
loose on his person or in his cloth- 
ing. 

B ut he did want samples. The 
vegetation alone was a discov- 
ery worth the trip. The unmanned 
probe had brought back no life but 
a few unexciting species of bacteria, 
and some spore-like things, which 
had refused to germinate on Earth. 
This spongy stuff was evidently a 
kind of lichen — half fungus, half 
alga — highly developed to wring 
from the inhospitable soil, air and 
sunlight what little nutrient and en- 
ergy they offered. Its tendency to 
break into balls when it reached a 
critical size, furthermore, meant that 
up on the surface it must travel with 
the winds when the summer air cir- 
culation set in — thus explaining the 
mysterious “wave of darkening” 
which swept down from the polar 
icecap when it melted, and explain- 
ing as well why the dark maria 
could never be permanently covered 
by the sandstorms. It was lichen, 
but it had adopted the spawning 
habit of the tumbleweed. 

Where did it get water? Surely 
there wasn’t enough water vapor in 
the air to be worth bothering with — 
certainly not enough to support the 
pcres and acres of life about him 
and, by extension, over all the dark 
areas of the planet. After a moment’s 
rsiizzlement the answer came to him. 
The fungal strands probably broke 
h chemically out of the sand, for 
every molecule of limonite carries 
'^'ith it, in chemical combination, 
^hree molecules of water. That way, 
the plant could get all its water 



without ever touching or needing a 
drop of water in the liquid state. At 
high noon, some of those water 
molecules would break free at the 
urging of sunlight and scurry for new 
positions, carrying other essential 
chemicals with them by loose bond- 
ing rather than in any sort of con- 
ventional solution. Some Earthly 
desert plants, the xerophytes, had 
the rudiments of a similar system for 
using bound water; it was what oc- 
casionally made specimen cactuses in 
museum cases suddenly sprout after 
decades of apparent lifelessness — 
and what kept alive grains of wheat 
which, buried thousands of years 
ago with the Pharaohs, sometimes 
astonished biologists by germinating. 
Here on Mars it was not an oddity, 
however, but a basic mechanism of 
life. 

Feeling a little dazed, Dolph care- 
fully stuffed fragments of the sponge 
into four of his vials, scrubbing his 
hands again afterwards — and the 
outsides of the vials, too. If his 
guess was correct, at least some of 
the material would be alive when he 
got home. 

After a last look at the sky he 
went back inside the crate, where he 
transferred samples from one of the 
vials onto several prepoured agar 
plates. He doubted that they would 
take hold, but there was no harm in 
trying. With his oxygen mask off he 
found the task, light though it was, 
a little tiring. A check with the bar- 
ometer showed that his cabin pres- 
sure was down to an Earthly equiv- 
alent of eight thousand feet — doubt- 
less due. to losses through the air- 
lock. Well, if Andean Indians could 



24 



IF 




live and do heavy labor at that alti- 
tude, so could he, he hoped, at 
least for a while. 

And now what? 

It might be worthwhile lifting ship 
and taking a look at some other spot. 
On the other hand, there was no 
reason to suppose than any other 
vegetated area would differ signif- 
icantly from this one, despite its 
isolation. Searching for possible 
ruins, like mapping or any other 
form of protracted exploration, was 
out of the question — it was beyond 
his equipment and his available time. 
After all, this trip was essentially 
only a stunt, and it would be sensible 
not to forget it. 

All the same, he could see no 
special reason why he should not 
levitate a mile or so above the des- 
ert — which would certainly put him 
above any pK>ssible mountains — and 
let the planet turn under him for a 
while, just to make a quick survey 
in the hope of seeing something in- 
teresting. If he stayed aloft only a 
few hours he could traverse as much 
as a sixth of the planet westward, 
crossing Syrtis Major and probably 
Isidis Regio too, and perhaps reach- 
ing the eastern marches of Aethiopis, 
where there was a chain of oases all 
far bigger than this one. 

Well, after alt, why not? He could 
spare four hours before he had to 
leave for home; that would even 
leave him a margin for error. He 
secured everything — quickly, though, 
because the afternoon was fading 
and he wanted to drift west in re- 
maining sunlight, trusting to the 
long shadows to betray anything real- 
ly striking on the surface. Keep- 



ing this idea in mind, he fed power 
into the rig. 

Nothing happened. 

A larmed, he checked the leads, 
but everything was tight. The 
coil was intact, too, and shorting the 
battery produced a nice, fat spark- 
shower. , 

Yet the crate simply refused to 
lift. 

Baffled, Dolph set about running 
a component-by-component check, 
grimly doing his best to keep his 
breathing even and shallow and his 
hands steady. The shadowless semi- 
dusk outside was becoming slowly 
but steadily dimmer, and above all 
he did not want to be caught on 
Mars over night. 

It did not, in fact, take him very 
long to find the trouble. It was in the 
one logically vulnerable spot in the 
system, and the one about which he 
could do precisely nothing: the 6BQ5 
power tube. It was, without ques- 
tion, burned out. 

Of course, he should have brought 
a spare; he realized that now. It 
wouldn’t have taken up much space. 
But he hadn’t. 

Almost any other failure in the 
rig, Dolph could have repaired. It 
was otherwise not much more com- 
plicated than a crystal radio. But 
this one was fatal. The tube had 
been brand new, and had tested out 
perfectly the day before he’d left 
Earth, but that was no comfort now. 
Once a tube goes, it is gone, regard- 
less of age. 

This one was dead, and that was 
that. 

And Dolph was marooned. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



25 




IV 

A LITTLE DETECTION 

T hough it was small consolation 
to Dolph, he could reflect — 
and it looked like he might have 
plenty of time for that — that part 
of his trouble was rooted in the early 
discovery of the transistor, found 
before the vacuum tube — or 
“thermionic valve” — had had a 
chance to come of age. Even in its 
heyday, now a decade gone, tube 
design had been more of an art 
than a science, depending almost as 
much upon a feeling for shapes and 
flows as on calculations of the mean 
free paths of electrons. As a re- 
sult, a well designed tube might 
function perfectly in any of a hun- 
dred uses for thousands of hours — 
or it might fail an hour after hav- 
ing passed its final tests at the fac- 
tory, and not even its designer could 
tell the successes from the lemons. 
Dolph’s solitary and crucial 6BQ5 
had evidently been a lemon. 

But the real failure, he knew very 
well, had been in his own fore- 
sight. 

Yet there was no time to be 
wasted in self-reproaches or in idle 
detective work. Dusk was falling 
fast, and the temperature even fast- 
er. At this rate it would be freez- 
ing outside by sunset. Yet, too, 
there would be no point in lurch- 
ing about inside the packing crate 
in a^ panic. He could not afford the 
loss of a drop of water, a cubic 
centimeter of oxygen or an erg of 
energy in waste motion. He needed 
first of all to run an inventory of 



what he had — and then to think 
about how he might best use it. 

And it had to be a detailed in- 
ventory — right down to the last 
thread. He could depend upon Mars 
for nothing, this early. He could 
not even hope. 

Oxygen first. He had started with 
five flasks, totaling 110 liters or 
45 gallons at Earth-normal pres- 
sure, stored at 300 pounds per 
square inch. One flask was prob- 
ably almost gone, and the drugstore 
gadget had no gauge to ‘tell him how 
much was left. Undoubtedly his to- 
tal store would last him the night, 
but he had to hope for much more 
time than that. He scribbled fur- 
iously on the walls of the crate. 

Ideally, he might seal the crate 
well enough to keep the air pres- 
sure inside at about one half of one 
Earth atmosphere, using Mars’s own 
nitrogen to pressurize the room if 
he could rig a way to pump it in 
enough of a hurry. But if he did 
that, he would need an oxygen 
volume of 40 per cent — twice 
Earth’s — in order to keep up the 
necessary oxygen pressure of 1 60 
mm. of mercury, and his supplies 
simply wouldn’t permit it, even over 
a short term. On the other hand, 
if he tried to maintain full Earth air 
pressure in the crate, he would need 
a lot of power, and that was in 
short supply too — no more than 
what remained in his battery. 

No immediate solution was ob- 
vious. All right, shelve it for now. 

Water: Possibly not a real worry 
yet. He had three i7.5 gallon drums 
of it — storage drums from the 
Civil Defense craze of 1962. The 



26 



IF 




drums were each 2234” high and 
stacked one on another in one cor- 
ner of the crate, leaving him four 
inches of headroom for unstacking 
them. Each had a plastic bag liner 
assembly with a spout which folded 
under its cover; one could be used 
as a commode by cutting the mouth 
of the liner and folding it around 
the top opening of the drum. When 
about seven-eighths full, the liner 
could be sealed with a wire tie — 
and saved, he thought with a grim- 
ness that left him no room to be 
squeamish, for fertilizer or half a 
dozen other easily imaginable uses, 
plus others that would doubtless 
occur to him if he lived long enough. 

H e was not foolish enough to be- 
lieve that 52.5 gallons could be 
called a lot of water. In the desiccat- 
ed airs of Mars he would have to 
consume a minimum of a gallon a 
day, not counting probably that 
much again lost by evaporation — 
probably being lost right now, right 
through the plastic liners. But there 
was life on Mars, and that meant 
there was water too. He thought 
that he might find enough to use 
in the three weeks to a month that 
the contents of the drums should 
give him. 

Now, food: He had a small case 
of K rations, what the specifications 
advertised as a two-week’s supply, 
which meant that It could be 
stretched as long as the water in 
the drums would. Thereafter, he 
would again have to see what he 
could find on Mars — and face the 
excellent chance that all the life 
here would prove poisonous to him. 



He also had a small packet of agar- 
agar and a jar of Bovril which he 
had brought along as food for cul- 
tures of Martian microorganisms, 
but he was sure he would have no 
objections to beef aspic for him- 
self instead — again, for so long 
as there was water to make it with. 
That might keep him alive another 
week. What else? Oh yes: six cans 
of evaporated milk, and two ounces 
of salt. And . one month’s sup- 
ply of multivitamin capsules, if he 
stretched it to the utmost. Where 
might he get more? That any life- 
form on Mars might contain any 
vitamin that he needed, let alone all 
of them, was close to impossible. 

All right, shelve that too. He 
had to hope. 

Power? The truck battery, possib- 
ly rechargable. Surely something 
could be done about that. Some- 
thing had to be done, for he would 
need power to keep up the air pres- 
sure, and probably also to generate 
oxygen by electrolysis of water if 
he could find water, and certainly to 
generate heat if he could think of 
no way to store heat during the 
day. The only other stored pK>wer 
he had with him was a small can of 
Sterno, which he did not dare even 
think of lighting until his oxygen 
problem could be made less acute. 
Nothing else was available but mus- 
cle power, which would not last 
long if Mars could not be made to 
refuel it. 

His clothing, counting what he 
had on, consisted of three pairs of 
long, heavy wool sox; two T-shirts; 
two pairs of boxer shorts and one 
of athletic shorts; two flannel shirts; 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



27 




one pair of heavy slacks; a pair of 
hiker’s shoes; a pair of heavy gloves; 
a racing driver’s helmet liner and a 
pair of heavy, padded, tinted gog- 
^es; a thick jacket, and a volum- 
inous wool muffler. Not bad in 
terms of the warmth needed, but 
he had to remember that all of it 
would wear rapidly on this harsh 
world — and rot rapidly, too, be- 
cause he would be unable to wash 
any of it, let alone himself. 




But he could patch. This thought 
moved him to add to this part of 
his inventory his blanket roll — two 
very ancient blankets, a torn sheet, 
a polyethylene garment-bag and the 
five feet of clothesline they were 
tied up with — and his belt, plus 
a spool of heavy-duty thread with 
a veritable whaler’s needle stuck into 
it, an old single-edged razor blade, 
and the canvas floor covering of 
the crate. Oh yes, his Scout knife, 
too. It had an awl in it, which 
would pierce canvas or leather. 

That seemed to cover tailoring 
and shoemaking. Nothing could be 
done now about the fact that he 
was totally ignorant of both trades. 
While the oxygen lasted, he would 
have to try to learn. 

T he notation of vitamins re- 
minded him that he was going 
to have to be sick some of the 
time — or perhaps even much of 
the time. But he did not even look 
into his first-aid kit to know how 
inadequate it was. Aspirin, PVP- 
iodine, Band-Aids, about a dozen 
capsules of some antibiotic left over 
from an illness two years ago and 
hence probably halved in potency, 
a semi-squashed tube of anesthetic 
ointment; that was all. Were he to 
be seriously ill, he would die, and 
that would be that. In view of the 
immediacy of the oxygen problem, 
the medical one did not alarm him 
much, however. Though he was 
scared, he felt the basic strength 
of his youth, and in addition a 
reassuring doubt that any Martian 
germ could be a real menace to 
his Earthborn body.

Mars would probably leave him be- of friction tape; a coil of copper 

tween noticing the need and finish- wire, length unknown, but obviously 

ing the machine? Nothing that he no more than five feet and probably 

saw in the cabin was reassuring, but less; and mirabile dictu, an axe, 

he noted every item on the wall all newly sharpened. In addition — for 

the same: One table; one breadboard though they were less obvious, they 



rig( with dead tube), a n small sol- too were tools — he had two pen- 
dering iron, with solder and flux (if cils, a bail-point pen, a drawing

compass, a protractor, a pocket 
compass, a wristwatch, a pair of 
binoculars, two star charts, an 
ephemeris and the Pic du Midi map 
of Mars (the most recent one, re- 
vised from the photographs sent back 
by the unmanned probes). 

After a moment’s thought, he add- 
ed to the list of tools a sub-class 
for Chemicals, but it did not con- 
sume much space: the salt, the 
agar, a small box of lye, six ounces 
of absolute alcohol and four of for- 
malin. What about his mess kit, 
and the canteen and canvas sling? 
Well, call those tools, too. At least 
the kit contained a spoon with fork 
prongs and a cutting edge. 

He looked slowly around the cab- 
in, which he had now to begin to 
think of as his home. He could see 
nothing that he had missed listing. 
That meant it was time to empty his 
pockets, which he did onto the 
table which bore the dead rig. 

When he was through, he had a 
bandanna; an extra pair of rawhide 
shoelaces; a pocket notebook; a 
few loose coins (to call home 
with?); his matches (in, ironically, 
a waterproof case); his wallet, con- 
taining four dollars and assorted 
cards (plus a snapshot of Nanette 
in the patented secret compartment) ; 
a key-ring on a snake chain with 
eleven keys on it, all of them now 
as useless ,as six of them had al- 
ways been mysterious; and finally, 
his class ring (which he had almost 
given to Nanette, and might just as 
well have, for all the good it was 
likely to do him on Mars). 

And that was absolutely all. No, 
not quite. There were eight small 



paper-clips and one middle-sized one 
marking pages in the ephemeris; and 
thrust into the wall, holding up the 
charts and the Pic du Midi map, 
fourteen push-pins. 

No matter how he looked at it 
all, it was not much of a survival 
kit. For anything else, he would 
have to depend upon Mars — and 
upon luck, who had abruptly al- 
ready stopped smiling on him. 

What now? Think! 

But he could think of nothing, 
except that he was suddenly thirsty. 

W 'hen the goddess of luck stops 
smiling, she is often likely to 
be thorough. Although Dolph had 
no way of knowing it, when she 
had run out on him on Mars, she 
had simultaneously deserted him 
forty-eight million miles away. 

Nanette had noticed that the tree- 
house was missing, on the very 
morning of its departure. 

Though she had taken sporadic 
care to disguise it around Dolph, 
Nanette’s mind was quick as well 
as gifted, and relentlessly logical as 
only the feminine mind can be 
without formal training. In addi- 
tion, she had a strong visual imag- 
ination — so powerful, in fact, that 
she was still wavering between 
wanting to be a painter, her first 
dream, and to be a scientist, a 
notion sparked by Dolph — and that 
midnight trip into the silent skies 
in Dolph’s first test crate had put 
her emotions into a secret ferment 
she hadn’t yet admitted. 

It would have taken a dull brain 
indeed to have failed to respond 
to the moonlit wonders of that 



30 



IF 




silent ascent, and since she al- 
ready knew in general knowledge 
the vastness of the problem Dolph 
had been nibbling at, she had not 
been slow to imagine what an auda- 
cious mind might do with a solution 
for it — a solution that Dolph 
obviously now had, at least in large 
part. If anti-gravity was achievable 
at all, ninety per cent of the work 
was done. Everything else was tech- 
nicalities, to be worked out in de- 
tail by any dim-witted engineer, or 
maybe even by a household electri- 
cian. 

Anw now the tree house was gone 
— and not a footprint below it to 
show that it had been carried any 
place else on Earth. It had been an 
elaborate and heavy tree house; it 
couldn’t possibly have been just 
wafted away — 

— unless, of course, it had done 
precisely and only that. It could 
not have vanished in any other way 
but that. 

She questioned Dolph’s mother 
cautiously. That was difficult, for 
the two women liked each other, 
and it was impossible for Nanette 
to disguise the fact that she was 
troubled. Luckily, Dolph’s cover 
story was good enough to give her 
reason to be troubled. Had he really 
gone camping without even letting 
her know he was going, she would 
have had good reason to be fur- 
ious, and Mrs. Haertel drew that 
conclusion and commiserated with 
her on male thoughtlessness. Nan- 
ette withdraw unscathed but shaky, 
and now furious indeed, though for 
quite different reasons. 

Given the additional facts in her 



possession, she saw at once that 
the cover story was full of holes, 
and only a little more elementary 
detective work among the tools, 
scraps, shavings and last-minute 
discards that Dolph had left was 
enough to confirm the conclusion 
she had been trying all morning 
not to have to draw. 

She climbed into the loft-space 
of the garage and hunkered down 
in the only part of it that had a 
floor, a dark and filthy corner 
where Dolph — years earlier, be- 
fore they had met — had abortively 
kept pigeons, all of which had died 
of some fungus disease Mrs. Haer- 
tel had said was dangerous to 
people, too. 

“The bum,” Nanette said bitterly. 
“That steaming, no-good, sneaky, 
runaway bum.” 

She was not at all surprised to 
find herself crying. She did a 
thorough job of it, though silently 
enough so that someone passing the 
garage would have heard from the 
abandoned cote only an occasional, 
ghostly coo. When it was over, half 
an hour later, she felt quite washed 
out — still furious, to be sure, but 
ready to cope with male perfidy on 
any scale the situation required. 
Wiping her nose on the inadequate 
tail of her skirt, she crunched back 
down the unsafe stairs to examine, 
first, Dolph’s work-bench, and then 
the abandoned test crate. 

“The bum,” she told the crate. 

“I’ll show /z/m,” she said, poking 
at half a bucket of glass-hard pitch. 

“Run out on me, will he,” she 
growled at an uncrumpled wiring 
diagram from the waste can. 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



31 




I' “And besides,” she said to last 
-jyear’s ephemeris, “he’s sure to be 
i(in trouble.” 

With an unexpected and uncon- 
trollably loud snihle, Nanette strode 
toward home in search of a solder- 
ing iron, constructing in her head 
as she went the rudiments of a cover 
story for herself. Though she had 
never before needed a really good 
one, she was grimly confident that 
she could make a better job of it 
than Dolph had. Constructing cover 
stories and passing them off with 
a perfectly bland countenance is an- 
other of the instinctive feminine arts 
for which no practice is needed 
(though sometimes it helps). 

It was not Nanette’s fault that 
this story — for her, for Dolph and 
for all the world — needed to be 
longer, wilder and more portentous 
than any told since the Viking long- 
boats groped toward an unknown 
Greenland. After all, she was only 
trying to nail down her man, with 
the same weapons that had served 
woman beside the brooks of Swans- 
combe in 250,000 B.C. 

“You in-ter-plan-et-ary hobo** 
she muttered across 48 million miles 
of storming space. “I’ll show you** 

V 

MORNING ON MARS 

D olph awoke slowly, stiff with 
cold and from the boards un- 
der his blankets. His mouth was 
parched, his lips cracked, his lungs 
wheezing. He felt half suffocated; 
and when he sat up, with a great 
start of alarm, he became so dizzy 



that he fell back with a gasp, won- 
dering where he was and what was 
wrong with him. 

Then he remembered. 

Without sitting up, he looked 
about cautiously. A hard beam of 
bluish sunlight, as sharp and merci- 
less as a laser ray, struck horizon- 
tally across the cabin from the port- 
hole but did not seem to reflect off 
anything; the rest of the enclosure 
was as dim as a cave. He tasted 
his dry lips with a swollen tongue, 
which made him cough, and at 
once he became conscious of being 
imbedded in an enormous silence. 
Even the cough sounded remote and 
feeble in his own ears, and when 
the silence flowed back it was as 
enormous as the bottom of the sea. 
Now he realized what had awakened 
him: a non-noise — the end of the 
last hiss of his first oxygen bottle. 

He struggled to his feet. The diz- 
ziness returned, but it was not 
as severe this time, and slowly pass- 
ed. He wondered if he should worry 
about it, but he was almost cer- 
tain that it was an effect of gravi- 
ty — after all, he weighed only 
48 pounds here, and it would take 
his heart and blood vessels time 
to get used to the lightened load. 

Oxygen was what counted now. 
He could allow time for nothing 
else until that need was met. And 
he had to face the fact that he 
would have to consume a good deal 
to provide for the possibility of 
more. He cracked open the second 
flask and got to work. 

First of all he ate, and then, from 
the traces of fat left in the K-ration 
container and a few crystals of lye. 



32 



IF 




he made a weak soap solution. A 
small loop of wire gave him a pass- 
^able bubble-pipe, and with the float- 
ing bubbles he had no trouble in 
locating three leaks in the walls of 
his cabin, two of them large enough 
to be critical. He marked them. 
There was bound to be minor seep- 
age too, but he could worry about 
that later, when the interior pres^ 
sure was high enough to make de- 
tecting it possible. 

Next, an electric motor. That was 
a simple enough proposition, re- 
quiring only two bits of metal and 
some wire, plus a frame which he 
delayed building until he could be 
absolutely sure of how he wanted 
to use the machine. He was already 
sure that the motor itself was too 
small, no matter how he would 
want to use it; but it was as big 
as he dared to build it with what 
he had on hand, and that would have 
to be that. 

For now, he wanted it as the heart 
of a pump, of a simple design he 
remembered seeing once in an ad- 
vertisement in a technical maga- 
zine. It was a pump that would 
never get wet, no matter what it 
pumped, because it consisted of 
nothing but two rollers continuous- 
ly squeezing a few inches of soft 
rubber tubing, the input end would 
go through the largest of his leaks 
to the Martian atmosphere; the out- 
put would open into the cabin. 

But what was he going to do for 
rollers? That was easy — two brief 
lengths of glass tubing, fused onto 
nails as axles with the aid of the 
Stemo can and the blowpipe. But 
he had to burn up the oxygen even 



more to get the Sterno to burn at 
all, and even so, his air was almost 
pure poison by the time the opera- 
tion was done. At home it would not 
have cost him half an hour. Here, 
it was as hard work as heaving coal. 

At last, however, the motor was 
connected to the battery, and hum- 
ming fairly smoothly. The little 
poot-poots of air that came out of 
it could hardly be felt, but he could 
only hope that they would add up to 
a sizeable increase in pressure be- 
fore too long. He had used the 
Sterno heat simultanously to soften 
a gob of pitch, with which he now 
closed the remaining leaks in the 
hull. Then, after five minutes of 
rest — it was not nearly enough — 
he valved the oxygen back down 
to a trickle. 

T T 7hile he rested, he became con- 
▼ ▼scions of a kind of whisper- 
ing, which at first he could not 
identify. Then he thought it might 
be wind, although such a thing 
seemed impossible in the near-vac- 
uum outside. Or was it? After all, 
many an astronomer had seen sand- 
storms sweeping Mars — seen them, 
and often cursed them for obscuring 
the view at a crucial opposition. 
Dolph got up and peered out. 

It was wind, all right. Gentle, al- 
most imperceptible waves were mov- 
ing along the surface of the ground- 
clinging vegetation, which as he 
watched became obscured by a 
faint haze, as though some invisible 
housekeeper was dusting them. 

After only a few moments, the 
whispering had become a sighing, 
and then the sighing developed a 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



33 




soft but definite whistling edge 
around the packing crate. The haze 
roze, and the far wall of the crater 
became dim. Soon it had vanished 
completely, and the air had become 
quite dark. Though it was still ob- 
viously day, there was no longer 
any direct sunlight visible — it was 
as though the sky had become over- 
cast. For a wild moment, Dolph 
wondered if it were going to rain. 

But of course it didn’t. The air 
simply continued to become darker 
with flying dust and fine sand. It 
was a good thing that his pump de- 
sign didn’t allow any access of the 
air to its moving parts, for the 
machine was far too fragile to stand 
much abrasion. As it was, he’d do 
well to slap some kind of filter over 
its input hole — and change the 
filter daily, if this kind of flurry 
happened every morning. 

If this was just a part of a gen- 
eral sandstorm, of course, the ad- 
venture was over. He would be 
buried, and that would be that. 

In half an hour, however, the 
whistling began to abate, and the 
day began to seem lighter once 
more. By the end of an hour, the 
crater was as still and brilliant as 
it had ever been; the thin air 
couldn’t carry even impalpable dust 
long without any current to keep 
it in motion. The whole thing, Dolph 
supposed, was just a local gust, 
probably caused by the heating of 
the valley when the sunlight struck 
it after the Hyperboreal night. 

He hoped so; for if the little storm 
were a regular occurence, he could 
use it; in fact, it would solve one 
of his most pressing problems — 



the problem of how to keep his 
battery charged. There was power 
for the taking out there. All he had 
to do was build a small generator — 
a slightly larger version of his mo- 
tor, with a thoroughly hammered 
piece of soft iron for a rotor, would 
do nicely — and a windmill. He 
could probably cut the sails for 
the windmill from his canvas. The 
stuff was rather heavy for the thin 
air, but on the other hand the gusts 
seemed to have plently of energy 
behind them. Only experiment 
would decide what the best sail 
design would be, though. 

His watch said that it was now 
near noon; the sun didn’t agree. 
The disagreement would grow as 
the slightly longer Martain day ex- 
panded, and as more days followed. 
He could of course open the back 
of the watch and retard the mech- 
anism’s governor as far as it would 
go, but he doubted that it would 
prove to be enough. It would be 
better to keep Martian time, ap- 
proximately, and use the watch 
only for timing short operations, as 
the need arose . and not risk 
exposing the watch’s innards to the 
dryness and the dust. Its sealed in- 
terior probably still preserved some- 
thing quite close to an Earth-normal 
atmosphere, and he decided against 
sacrificing that for an experiment in 
collimation which was probably too 
delicate to come off anyway. 

B ut the reminder of noon re- 
minded him also that at home 
he would be coming up on lunch 
time. Here on Mars, he would have 
to give it another title: No-Lunch 



34 



IF 




time, or perhaps some title that 
didn’t mention food at all. Medieval 
man, after all, had gotten along 
handily on two meals a day, and 
animals — carnivores, anyhow — 
only had to be fed once. Until 
further notice, he was going to have 
to be an animal. All the same, if 
he had, say, a stack of blueberry 
pancakes about seven inches high, 
and a pitcher of cold buttermilk, 
and .... 

No more of that nonsense, he 
told himself grimly. You get six 
ounces of water — and then back 
to work. 

What was next? Potentially he 
had air pressure; and even more 
potentially, he had power. But he 
still did not have oxygen — only 
a means of conserving it slightly, 
not of replenishing it. He had to 
have a source. 

Was the clear fluid in the Mar- 
tian plants water — or something 
that was mostly water? If so, that 
would solve his oxygen problem too, 
if he kept busy enough, for he could 
always crack it by electrolysis — 
and burn the hydrogen produced 
after the Sterno ran out, if he could 
figure out a way to store the hydro- 
gen. He seriously doubted that he 
could, for the, universe’s lightest gas 
is elusive stuff even under Earth- 
normal pressures, and he certainly 
couldn’t hope to pump it success- 
fully through rubber tubing — you 
might as well hope to pump water 
through tubing made of sponge. 

He shook his head savagely. Hyd- 
rogen wasn’t his problem. The thin- 
ness and impoverishment of the air 
was blurring his thinking — that. 



and the fact that he was hungry, 
though as yet the hunger was prob- 
ably mostly in his imagination. Oxy- 
gen was what he needed — not 
hydrogen, oxygen! 

He opened one of his specimen 
bottles cautiously and looked at the 
ambiguous plants inside it. They did 
not seem much withered; well, may- 
be the denser, damper air inside the 
cabin was a feast to them. The lit- 
tle transparent sacs were stiff and 
glistening, as though they were 
nearly ready to burst. How to tell 
if that stuff was water? 

He popped one experimentally. To 
his intense disappointment, nothing 
came out of it — nothing at all. 
Inside it was bone dry. He popped 
another, with the same result. If 
the sacs didn’t store sap, then what 
could they be for? 

While he was puzzling about that, 
he pinched another sac, which 
promptly confused him by spurting 
cold liquid into his face, in a fine 
spray which dried instantly and left 
him feeling sticky and taut, as 
though he had just dried off after 
coming out of the ocean. No doubt 
about that one — that had been 
sap of some sort, containing salts 
in solution, and probably sugars, 
too. But what was the solvent? 

He still could think of no simple 
chemical test which might answer 
this question. Yet, after all, what 
other answer could there be? There 
is only one universal solvent — or 
at least, only one which is stable 
at the temperature ranges prevalent 
on Mars. On Jupiter, liquid am- 
monia might do nicely — but luck- 
ily, he wasn’t on Jupiter. Mars was 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



35 




quite^bad enough. It had to be wat- 
er. It just couldn’t be anything else. 

What about the substances that 
were dissolved in it? They might 
well be poisonous. He didn’t dare 
take the chance that they weren’t 

— at least, not yet, not until his 
food ran out. He would have to 
distill the sap after he collected it 

— more heat needed for that, but 
perhaps not heat which would con- 
sume oxygen; he might power a 
still from the sun, with an arrange- 
ment of burning glasses and mir- 
rors. Come to think of it, a simple 
mirror arrangement might help 
warm the cabin during the day, 
too. 

Qpeaking of the sun, what had 
O happened to it? The cabin was 
getting dark again. Automatically 
he looked at his watch: 4:38. He 
had been on Mars just a little past 
one full Earth day. It would not 
be dusk yet up on the tilted pla- 
teau — only mid-afternoon — but 
the floor of the oasis would get 
no more direct sunlight today, and 
the temperature would already be 
dropping. Would there be another 
brief standstorm shortly after full 
dark? Probably — but with luck he 
would sleep through At. 

With luck he would sleep through 
a great deal more than that. In 
general, the less activity, the bet- 
ter, ^ beyond what was absolutely 
necessary to keep himself alive, 
until — 

Until wha't? 

He discovered that he did not 
know. Rescue was out of the ques- 
tion; just to begin with, nobody 



knew where he was. He supposed 
it would be possible, once his wind- 
mill-generator was set up, to build 
a spark-gap radio transmitter and 
to make it heard, for he remember- 
ed having read somewhere that the 
amount of power required for ef- 
fective interplanetary radio was as- 
tonishingly small. But that would 
do him precisely no good at all, for 
a spark-gap transmitter can send 
nothing but bursts of noise — dots 
and dashes, long noises ' and short 
ones — and he did not know any 
code, Morse or otherwise, except, 

ironically, ... ... for “help!” 

and ... - from the Beethoven Fifth 
Symphony, which his father some- 
how knew was Morse for “v” — 
also useless. 

la fact, the spark would do him 
no good until the first manned for- 
mal expedition to Mars was actual- 
ly in the sky above him. Then he 
could use it to draw attention to 
himself, and, come to think of it, 
the expedition could triangulate on 
the signal and locate him precise- 
ly. Until then, he had many bet- 
ter uses for electricity than produc- 
ing arbitrarily patterned bursts of 
radio noise. 

And the first manned formal ex- 
pedition to Mars was a long way 
off yet — a long way off. At the 
thought, he sat down on the floor 
and began to batter one fist slowly, 
mechanically into the palm of the 
other hand. Up until now, when 
be had considered the matter of 
survival of all, except in the minute- 
to-minute basis of actually working 
at it, he had thought in terms of 
months. But survival and rescue? 



36 



IP 




That was going to be a matter of 
years . and perhaps a matter of 
decades. 

No stretching of rations would 
carry him through that. If he lived 
at all, he was going to have to live 
off the land — off the most alien, 
the most bitter, the most inhospitable 
land ever to feel the impact of a 
human foot. 

If only he had thought to bring 
a spare tube — the only component 
in the breadboard rig whose failure 
could not be compensated for by 
any sort of improvisation! If only, 
in general < — since in fairness to 
himself he would not have asked 
anyone’s forethought to be quite so 
specific — it had occurred to him 
that something, no matter what, 
might happen to make his stay 
longer than his plans had called for! 
There were twenty small articles 
he might have brought with him, 
all without overloading his craft in 
the least, that would have increased 
his chances of survival many times 
over twenty-fold. 

But it was too late now. He was 
on Mars for ten years to come, 
and quite possibly for life. 

Suddenly he realized that it was 
pitch black in the crate. Where had 
the day gone? He hadn’t accom- 
plished 'a fraction of what needed 
to be done. 

In the darkness he could hear 
his air-pump running. For a mom- 
ent the sound was obscurely com- 
forting — at least he had gotten 
that much done — until he noticed 
that the pump’s cycle seemed to 
have developed a slight irregularity; 
he’d have to check that, first thing 



in the morning. Quite possibly there 
was some grit lodged somewhere in 
the tubing which was throwing the 
thing off stride. If the obstruction 
got any bigger it might break one 
of the glass rollers. 

In the meantime, through the 
cold blackness of the Martian night 
it whispered to him steadily: 
Forlife forlife forlife forlife for- 
life forlife forlife . ’. 

VI 

EVENING ON MARS 

I t was not strictly true, of course, 
that no one knew where Dolph 
was. But for all the good it did 
him — or was going to do him in 
the foreseeable future — it might 
just as well have been true. 

Nanette now knew where he was 
with some specificity. A discarded 
map of Mars torn out of a book — 
discarded apparently because it was 
a Flagstaff map, out of an obser- 
vatory where astronomers had been 
letting their imaginations abet their 
eyes about the red planet ever since 
the days of Lowell — a scribbled 
ellipse enclosed the Syrtis Major; 
and common sense told her that 
Dolph would most likely have 
stuck to that planned landing area, 
simply because so large a green 
spot, so near the equator, would 
be almost guaranteed to be the 
most livable area on Mars, par- 
ticularly in high summer. That the 
marked area was at least as big as 
Alaska did not daunt her at all, 
since it never occurred to her. Even 
more than Dolph — probably be- 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



37 




cause she was younger — her 
thought processes were a mixture 
of sheer brass, naive and hence as- 
tounding ingenuity, and glorious 
inattention to niggling but crucial 
details which would have scared any 
adult green — any adult, that is, 
who like most could no longer re- 
call the contradictions that had made 
up his own brain as a teen-ager. 

Nanette also knew, even more 
specifically, how Dolph had gotten 
where he was, and how she was go- 
ing to get there after him. On 
this latter count, quite a bit of 
the work had already been done for 
her, in the form of Dolph’s first 
flying model — the one he had 
taken her aloft in, thus putting the 
essence of his secret in her hands 
— which still stood on the floor 
of the garage. With the aid of the 
wiring diagrams she had been able 
to check the rig — which, being 
the original, was even simpler than 
the one which had actually taken 
Dolph away — and, with her sol- 
dering iron, to repair the few places 
in the circuit Dolph’s voltmeter 
showed had failed, or might fail 
under a work load. The bucket of 
pitch had suggested to her the 
necessity of caulking her proposed 
craft (she might, it must be con- 
fessed, not have thought of it with- 
out some such hint), and in general, 
once she kniew the category in which 
she needed to be thinking, other 
clues^ 'hints and helps pwjpped out 
at her not only from all over the 
garage, but from memory and from 
reading, in bewildering profusion. 

She could not take advantage of 
all of them. For one thing, she was 



dead certain that she was in a hurry 
— and even under normal circum- 
stances she was not much inclined 
to be patient. Second, she had not 
accumulated any money for the ven- 
ture, and even at the best would 
have had fewer sources to call upon 
than Dolph had had. Finally — and 
most crucially — she did not think 
of everything. 

But in one major respect she kept 
her head. She left a note. It read: 

Dear Mom and Dad, and Mr. & 
Mrs. Haertel, 

You won’t believe this but 
you simply must, because it’s 
absolutely true. Dolph has not 
gone camping. He has gone to 
Mars, and I have gone after 
him. 

I know how this sounds but 
maybe if we do not come back 
for a while and you don’t find 
us anywhere else you may think 
of it again. We haven’t eloped 
or run away or anything stupid 
like that. It’s just that Dolph 
has discovered some kind of 
anti-gravity which is very sim- 
ple to build and run. He took 
me for a sho,rt run in it and 
then he built a sort of space- 
ship in his tree house and went 
to Mars in it on a junket I 
know he didn’t plan to stay long 
because he didn’t take enough 
supplies and things with him, 
but he’s not back yet and I 
have to go because he probably 
needs help. 

He marked a place called 
Syrtis Major on a map of Mars 
and I’m pretty sure he’s stuck 
somewhere there, so that’s 
where I’m going too. I will 



38 



IF 




bring him back if everything 
goes right. If it doesn’t then 
we really will be in a pickle, 
but please don’t worry. 

Love and things, 
Nanette 

She carefully enclosed the map 
in the envelope — but none of 
Dolph’s wiring diagrams, or his 
calculations, or his notes, or any- 
thing else that might have helped 
anyone to rediscover Dolph’s anti- 
gravity, let alone put it immediately 
to useful work. All these she packed 
neatly into a manila envelope for 
Dolph, on the chance — which she 
thought good — that he migjit have 
left some one of them beihind by 
accident, and would now be need- 
ing it. 

Then she heaved and tugged her 
own small vessel onto an old sled, 
hauled it out of the garage into the 
road and took off — in darkness, 
as Dolph had gone. With her went 
the priceless and useless envelope 
of paper — useless to Dolph, and 
certainly to her; and priceless be- 
cause, left on Earth, they would 
have been Dolph’s and Nanette’s 
last hope of rescue. The darkness 
swallowed her with its usual in- 
difference, leaving behind only the 
heart-stopping, icy flame of a sum- 
mer night in Iowa, where hardly 
anyone ever looks up at the eternid 
stars except the young who love 
them. 

A s for Dolph, he was making a 
wine press, and finding it a 
harder job than his preliminary 
sketches had made it seem. Had 



he had nothing but grapes to think 
about, he would have given it up 
at once; but it was his own life 
he was trying to squeeze. 

He had yet to discover what else 
besides water was in the sap-sacs 
of the tumble-lichens; but when the 
firey, itching dryness of ^is mouth, 
throat and nose in the mornings 
was complemente4 by nosebleeds 
and a hacking cough, he realized 
belatedly that he had to keep his 
cabin air moist, or die of dehydra- 
tion of the respiratory system. A 
wick of torn cloth dipped into a 
Petri dish seemed the logical an- 
swer to that — and yet he hated 
to use his bottled water for any 
purpose besides actually drinking it. 

The obvious solution was to use 
sap squeezed out of the plants. 
There was a dividend of sorts to be 
gained in the process, too. In the 
course of aimlessly popping the ap- 
parently empty sacs and wondering 
what they contained, and what they 
were good for if the answer was 
“nothing,” he had thought to pop 
one near a match-flame. The match 
had produced a brief, tiny, but quite 
definite increase in brightness. The 
“empty” sacs, in short, contained 
oxygen — ^perhaps not the pure stuff, 
but close to it. 

Both discoveries made sense. 
There was not enough water vapor 
or oxygen in the Martian atmosphere 
to sustain a plant so much like an 
Earthly one as this was. The tumble- 
lichen obviously had to crack both 
out of the basic limonite sands in 
which it grew. And to maintain 
sufficient vapor pressure and oxy- 
gen tension to support life in its 



THE HOUR BEFORE EARTHRISE 



39 




cells, it had to maintain both inside 
itself — in that part of the environ- 
ment the famous physiologist Claude 
Bernard had called the milieu inter- 
ieur — ^since both were denied it on 
the outside. 

Hence if Dolph were to squeeze 
water out of the plants inside his 
cabin, he would pick up some oxy- 
gen too. Probably no more than 
a small fraction of what he needed, 
but every extra molecule was a gain. 
The cake that was left over after 
the pressing operation could be 
piled outside Ae packing crate, 
against the time when he might need 
it for bedding, for insulation, for 
fertilizer — ‘he really had no idea 
what it might eventually be good for. 
He did already know, however, that 
for him the first law of survival was 
Save it — ^no matter what “it” might 
be. (And many New Englanders 
might have told him the second and 
third laws, which were Use it up and 
Make it do; but he had in fact al- 
ready arrived at them, although he 
hadn’t put them to himself quite so 
tersely.) 

When the wine press was com- 
pleted, it looked quite like a bellows- 
frame without its collaj>sible sides 
(or what a health-food addict would 
have called a juicer). The next step 
he had planned was to begin to 
make a still from some of his avail- 
able glassware, while he still had 
enough oxygen to insure finishing 
the job — and before time had in- 
sured that he would need stiU more 
oxygen to complete it, by provid- 
ing accidents to break some of the 
glassware. 

But the day was already waning 



— he had long since given up really 
believing that Martian days were ac- 
tually longer than Earth days — and 
he did not want to break off making 
the still in the middle. Instead, it 
seemed like a useful idea to give the 
press a try. That would take him 
outside to gather tumble-lichens. He 
had not been outside for two days, 
and needed the exercise before he 
became both too stiff and too weak 
to move. The cramped quarters, the 
cold nights and the low gravity were 
conspiring to rob him of strength. 

He attached to his belt a length 
of rope to bale up the plants with, 
donned his heavy clothes and his 
respirator, and crawled out onto 
the powdery sands. He was just in 
time for the evening dust-up, which 
nearly' froze him before he could 
get into the lee of his ship, but it 
was quickly over and seemed to 
have done him no permanent dam- 
age. He resolved, nevertheless, to 
check on how close dusk might be 
before venturing outside again; 
there would be no harvesting for 
him this evening. 

B efore starting back, he indulged 
a glance at the sky. 

It was quite black at the zenith 
and -almost all the way to the hor- 
izons, though there was a remaining 
glow of steel blue along the edge of 
the crater behind which the small 
sun had set. The stars were brilliant, 
and there seemed to be thousands 
of them, many more than had ever 
been visible in the Iowa skies even 
during the best conditions of seeing. 
He doubted that Mars would ever 
allow him the time to relearn to 



40 



IF 




pick out the constellations, although 
their shapes could not be much 
changed here. 

All the same, there were two un- 
usual objects in the sky right now. 
One was a dim spark of light skim- 
ming over the northern edge of the 
crater. It had to be one of the two 
satellites — nothing else in the Mar- 
tian sky could move visibly — and of 
them, the choice was probably Dei- 
mos, the larger and farther out of 
the two; he was almost surely too 
far south on the planet to be able 
to see Phobos, even from up on the 
plateau. Even Deimos was only a 
dim spark, very far removed indeed 
from the low-hanging, looming Dei- 
mos of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s 
Mars. Had it not been moving, he 
would have been unable to pick it 
out from many stare more brilliant. 

But the Other unusual object was 
something about which there could 
be no argument, though Dolph had 
never seen it before in just this way. 
It was a star as brilliant as Rigel 
or Sirius, and — though none of the 
Martian stars twinkled, for the at- 
mosphere was far too thin for that 
— with a steady intensity which 
marked it as not a star at all, but 
a planet. Furthermore, though it 
glared as blue-white as any of the 
stellar giants, there was also a green- 
ness about its light shared by no 
star Dolph had ever seen, then or 
now. 

Looking up at it, Dolph felt him- 
self slowly drowning in an invisible 
sea of homesickness. He would not 
have believed it possible that any- 
one could feel his whole heart and 
soul so drawn toward what seemed 



to be no more than a point of light 
. brilliant and beautiful, to be 
sure, but only one among so many. 
Then the Earth went out 
For a moment he thou^t his eyes 
had failed him, and brushed one 
glove across his goggles. In the next, 
a sudden shocking suspicion of dis- 
aster hit him, one of those night- 
mares with which everyone has 
lived since Hiroshima. But if the 
Earth had blown up, then — 

He was left no more time for 
guessing, for other stars around 
where the Earth had been were go- 
ing out too — and then, just for a 
second, there flashed in the black 
space near the zenith a sort of 
lozenge of reddish-yellow light, like 
one side of a falling box. 

I t was a falling box, which had 
briefly caught the last of the sun- 
light before sinking below the lip of 
the crater. Now he could no longer 
judge its fall except by the spread- 
ing area of starlessness above him. It 
was — it had to be, there was no 
other possibility — another crate like 
his own. It was heading straight 
down for him, and it was coming far 
too fast. 

He knew that it would do him no 
good to run. He might just as well 
die under it, as be in the clear if it 
were going to smash his own home. 
He stood rooted to the freezing 
ground, watching. 

The area of blackness grew. 
Then suddenly it seemed to stop 
growing for a moment, and veer off 
to the northwest. In the next instant, 
it was no longer between him and 
the stars, and was lost in the night.

FEODAR'S BOX 

by ROBERT E. LORY 



When Feodor was lost, if was an 
accident. But when he was found 
again — it was a total disasterl 



T he thick-spectacled man was un- 
impressive to look at. He was in 
his fifties, small, slight of build; his 
appearance could be be described as 
unkempt. Yet when he showed up 
suddenly in Room 109 carrying a 
little black box, eyelids clicked open 
and voices halted in midsentence. 

The reaction was justified. No- 
body was supposed to know about 
Room 109 — nobody, at least, who 
wasn’t specifically cleared by the 
Prime Minister. And those cleared 
were very few and very well known 
to each other. 

And nobody in Room 109 knew 
the slight, unkempt man with the 
little black box. 

Chief secret agent Chlebnik 
sprang into action. Springing wasn’t 
easy for Chlebnik — ^he weighed two 



hundred seventy-seven pounds. 
Nonetheless, he jumped from his 
chair, directed two office workers 
to latch onto the uninvited new- 
comer and, seeing his order accomp- 
lished, quickly passed through the 
three doors and dim hallway to 
Room 109-J, the existence of which 
was known only to himself, Palakov 
and the Prime Minister. 

When he swung open the door to 
Palakov’s office, Chlebnik was sur- 
prised to see his superior had a 
visitor. 

The visitor’s figure contrasted 
sharply to that of Palakov, whose 
rolls of fat made even Chlebnik look 
lean. 

The visitor was a slight, unkempt 
man wearing thick spectacles and 
holding a little black box. 



43 




S teel-black eyes greeted Chlebnik. 

“How do you explain thisV 
Palakov said icily. 

Chlebnik did his best. “But . 
but I left this man in 109, well 
guarded. I came here to report his 
presence to you.” 

“And he reached here before 
you? How is that possible? And how 
did he get into 109 in the first place? 
How did he get past the locks, the 
outside guards, the inside guards?” 
Difficult questions. But Chlebnik 
had answered difficult questions be- 
fore. At the university he’d been an 
accomplished practitioner in lan- 
guage, logic, debate and dialectic. 
But it seemed impossible to handle 
Palakov’s questions in terms of Cap- 
italistic Oppression of the Masses. 
So Chlebnik said nothing and simp- 
ly stared at the little man with the 
box in his hand. 

“Perhaps — if I might attempt an 
explanation?” the little man offered 
timidly. 

“By all means, attempt.” Palakov' 
directed his visitors to chairs with a 
gesture of his fleshy hand. 

The little man cleared his throat. 
“Tlie loyal party member and serv- 
ant of the state who sits before 
you is named Feodar Rodumetoff. 
In recent years I’ve been under as- 
signment to the Prime Minister him- 
self, working on a special device — 
this box, which — ” 

“One moment,” Palakov broke in. 
“Rodumetoff, you say? Strange, I 
recall nothing of you.” He motioned 
Chlebnik to a large steel filing cab- 
inet across the room. 

“I assure you, Feodar Rodumetoff 
is the only name by which I’ve been 



known since birth. But perhaps you 
don’t recognize me because you’re 
new here.” 

**New?** Palakov reared back at 
the use of the word in connection 
with his term of office. After all, 
he’d held this post five years — a 
long tenure considering the political 
setbacks his country’s statesmen 
were often exposed to. “New?** 
“What I mean is, you weren’t here 
when I last was — w^hen I received 
the assignment from Premier Stalin 
and — ” 

He was interrupted at the same 
instant by both listeners. “Stalin?** 
Beads of sweat covered Palakov’s 
face. “Exactly when did you re- 
ceive this . assignment from — 
Premier Stalin?” 

While Feodar considered the 
question, Chlebnik fingered fran- 
tically through the files. 

“Directly a^ter the war, I be- 
lieve. At that time I was working 
on — ” He adjusted his glasses and 
surveyed Palakov warily through the 
thick lenses — “on another project. 
I should hazard a guess that it was 
around 1946 or 1947. Sometime 
around there, I’m sure.” 

“And you’ve been working in 
isolation since then?” 

“Rodumetoff, Feodar!” Chlebnik 
roared triumphantly, pulling a large 
blue card from the files and laying 
it on Palakov’s desk. 

“Isolation? Well, you might call 
it that, I don’t suppose I did get out 
of my workshop too often.” 

Palakov look^ up from the card. 
“But what about the radio, Pravda, 
Izvestiya?** 

“No time for that sort of thing. 



44 



IF 




My subscriptions to the scientific 
journals even lapsed. The immediate 
work at hand occupied my mind en- 
tirely.” 

Palakov looked back at the blue 
card and reread the statement that 
Feodar Rodumetoff had been exe- 
cuted for the good of the state in one 
or another of the purges that fol- 
lowed discovery of Stalin’s treason- 
ous activities. Thinking to himself 
that somebody was going to pay 
heavily for such stupidity, he smiled 
good-naturedly at Feodar. 

“Well, then. Comrade Rodumet- 
off. I trust that so much time ded- 
icated to our people’s good has 
been fruitfully employed?” 

“Indeed yes,” Feodar said enthus- 
iastically, waving the little box. 
“This device will revolutionize — 
he noticed the startled faces of 
Palakov and Chlebnik — “er, will be 
©f tremendous value in both war 
and espionage.” 

“And just what does it do?” Pal- 
akov asked. 

In answer, Feodar turned a knob 
on the top of the box. A slight hum- 
ming sound began, and then disap- 
peared. 

So did Feodar Rodumetoff. 

“God!” Chlebnik exclaimed. 

“Comrade Chlebnikr Palakov 
said sternly. 

“Excuse it, comrade, a slip of the 
tongue.” 

The telephone rang then. Palakov 
answered, listened and placed the 
receiver back on the hook slowly. 
His face went white. 

“That,” he said, “ — ^that was Feo- 
dar Rodumetoff, calling from your 
officer 



C hlebnik had been sent back to his 
duties in Room 109. In 109-J 
Palakov listened in fascination as 
Feodar explained the workings of 
the miraculous box, he held secure- 
ly in his hands. 

“So you see — a slot and two 
knobs. The holder of the box be- 
comes invisible if he inserts his 
finger in the slot. When this knob 
is turned, your body dematerializes 
and can pass easily through solid 
structures — walls, for instance. To 
materialize again, you simply turn 
this second knob.” 

“Unbelievable! The possibilities of 
the thing are astounding,” Palakov 
said, his jowls suddenly frowning. 
‘Tell me, who else knows of your 
project?” 

Feodar smiled proudly. “No one. 
I worked quite alone. It was all very 
secret and, besides that, there arc 
very few with technical knowledge 
of the sort necessary to aid in the 
box’s construction.” 

“And where are the other nnodels? 
I’m rather concerned for their safe- 
ty.” 

“There are none. This is the only 
one of its kind.” 

“The plans for it, then — ^where 
are they?” 

“Here,” said Feodar, tapping his 
forehead. “Adequately safe from 
theft.” 

“Excellent. In that case, if you’ll 
hand that box over to me. I’ll keep 
it here under strict security. And 
now, comrade, leave your address 
with Chlebnik and return home un- 
til you get word from me. It will be 
soon, I assure you.” 

True to his word, immediately af- 



FEODAR'S BOX

ter Feodar left the office, Palakov 
telephoned orders to Ohlebnik. 

“Our records show him as dead. 
Aside from considering the danger 
to the state that the man repre- 
sents, we must keep our records ac- 
curate,” he told his subordinate. 

Palakov then made a second call 
and arranged for Chlebnik’s liquida- 
tion. He had to be removed, of 
course — ^he knew about the box. 

The box. Palakov touched it ad- 
miringly with his meaty right hand. 
“The possibilities are astounding,” 
he’d told Feodar. And they were. 
Soldiers carrying the box would be 
invincible. Bullets would go right 
through them, harming nothing. An 
entire city equipped with the device 
could withstand even atomic attack. 
And espionage. Where couldn’t spies 
go, what couldn’t they do? What 
possibilities! Naturally the device 
would have to be tested thoroughly. 

He drew his poised finger back 
quickly and looked self-consciously 
over his shoulder. 

Well, why not? he asked him- 
self. Somebody had to do the test- 
ing. The pudgy finger poised again 
and entered the slot. He was invis- 
ible. 

He turned the first knob. He was 
dematerialized. 

Weightless, nothingness — ^what a 
wonderful feeling! Strange, he al- 
most thought he’d sink through the 
floor. But of com^e — weightless, he 
had nothing for gravity to act upon. 
But he could direct his body, he 
found. There, through the wall — ac- 
tually through a wall! And another 
one. 

He was out in 109 now. Chlebnik 



sat dumbly happy at his desk. Poor 
Chlebnik, soon to be a state sac- 
rifice. Ah, well — ah! Now, how was 
it Palakov never noticed that shape- 
ly file clerk before? 

He chuckled. A little pinch, per- 
haps? Surely, what was a little pinch 
between comrades? There. 

No reaction? 

Of course. He was dematerialized 
completely. He’d have to give the 
second knob a little turn. 

Odd. The second knob was just to 
the left of — 

When he realized there was no 
longer a second knob, Palakov 
screamed. Of course, nobody could 
hear him. 

I n his dusty workshop, Feodar 
Rodumetoff took a small knob 
from his pocket and screwed it in 
the top of one of the sixty boxes in 
neat rows on a long lab table. 

Admiring the completed device, 
he checked to make sure he’d for- 
gotten nothing. Yes, he’d given 
Chlebnik an incorrect address. Yes, 
he’d sent the coded message to Nor- 
way that “P” was no longer a prob- 
lem. Yes, he’d stolen the blue iden- 
tification card that labeled him dead. 

Dead, was he? How well he re- 
membered the night they tried! How 
lucky he was that he’d perfected the 
first working model of his inven- 
tion. He’d made up his mind then 
and there how he’d get even. 

He hefted the new box and head- 
ed for the door. He stopped short, a 
strange look coming over his face. 
He’d have to check his maps again. 
He’d forgotten the Prime Minister’s 
room number. END

The police methods of tomorrow 
always work — except this time, 
when the victim did not exist! 



I 

I t started innocently enough. No, 
strike that. Innocence was long 
gone. It started the usual way for 
me; I was sent for. 

Did that sound strange? I suppose 
it was. There were very few of us, 
at least of those of us who had jobs 
worth having, who went to their 
work instead of having it come to 
them. I had to put up with it, though. 
A policeman’s lot was not a happy 
one. 

My bedroom alarm sounded. My 
sleeping accommodations were strict- 



ly solo, even though the room was 
full sized. RHIP. “Rank hath its 
privileges,” as the ancients used to 
say. I did have rank. The alarm was 
quiet; I woke easily. That is, it was 
easy for whoever or whatever woke 
me, but on me it was murder. 

When I was waked at night, it 
usually was. 

I didn’t stop for details, just the 
place. There were few reliable wit- 
nesses, and I gave up listening to 
gory details when a ravishing and 
ravished blonde turned out to be a 
middle-aged male heart-attack vic- 
tim. 



47 




My police bug looked just like a 
heli-cab, but it was a quick animal of 
metal and plastic with more horse- 
power than standard. That didn’t 
show. It also had manual controls 
and fuel cells, so I could leave the 
roadways. I never needed to. I was 
really not the adventurous sort. 

The robot traffic controls phased 
me through non-stop. I got there fast, 
and most of the time that was 
enough. Either the killing was a spur 
of the moment thing, and thereby 
either very quick or very difficult, 
or somebody was so extremely clever 
as to tie a noose around his own 
neck. A figurative noose; we didn’t 
use the real thing any more. There 
were more humane ways of ultimate 
disposal, and in most cases restrain- 
ing was a better solution, socially. 
That was not my worry. 

This was going to be different. I 
knew it immediately, I felt it in my 
bones. Different, and a new kind of 
torment. 

I t could have been a sex crime. 

They’re always bad, but this 
smelt worse. The victim was male, I 
guessed his age at seventeen, possiblv 
nineteen. He was either nude or 
naked, depending on whether he 
wanted to be that way. Had wanted 
to be that way. He lay on his right 
side, legs bent up acutely. It did not 
look like a foetal position; for one 
thing, his‘ trunk was bent back rath- 
er than forward. One of his arms 
was under him, the other thrown 
back with the elbow bent in a way 
unbroken bones could not manage. 
He was heavily bruised, and his face 
was bloody. 



His scalp had been shaved 
smooth. Bald. 

I looked up. Cabs passed a few 
feet overhead, two or three going by 
within a few seconds. It was going 
to be interesting, finding out which 
of them had carried him here. I 
would have bet willingly that the 
corpse had been pushed or rolled 
over the railing of a taxi. 

The stars, far beyond, twinkled 
at me, laughing. 

I turned back to the boy. That’s 
all he was, that’s all 'he had been, 
a boy. He had been dead long enough 
so that rigor mortis had come and 
gone. The robosurg would find out 
quickly how long. His fingertips 
would tell who he had been. Then, 
a canvass of his family, his friends, 
his credit card account, that would 
be it. There would be questions to 
answer, of course. 

I wondered how he had been kill- 
ed. Oh well, the robosurg would find 
that out, too, and maybe give a clue 
about where. I wondered if he wait- 
ed long to die. The expression on his 
face told me that he had known 
that he was being had. Many go 
limp, others stay stiff. 

I wondered who had killed him. 
How could the murderer ever be- 
lieve that he could get away from 
us, from me? 

As the robots moved in and pick- 
ed him up, I saw something. A 
wound in his abdomen, about twen- 
ty-five millimeters long, and narrow. 
A stabbing. I hadn’t seen one of 
those in — how long? — fifteen years. 

He hadn’t necessarily died of it. 
The opening was small, and we 
didn’t have an awful lot of knives

IF 




around with long, narrow blades. It 
was too low to have been aimed at 
a vital spot, anyway. It might have 
penetrated only into the flat belly 
muscles and done no important dam- 
age except cause bleeding. And pain. 

There was little external blood. 
Either he had been washed, or he 
had been practically dead when he 
was stabbed. 

The meat wagon lifted him away 
and I examined the alley again. We 
were outside the dome area of City 
proper, in the almost deserted ware- 
house storage sector. There was an 
amusement park near here — an 
amusement park in the new sense — 
and that accounted for the volume 
of cab traffic overhead. 

It might also account for the mur- 
der. The unwritten law was repealed, 
but now and then it was still en- 
forced. A post thirty-five husband 
still could easily take exception to 
his wife’s housebreaking a teen-age 
boy in the fashion that is as old as 
mankind, and, for that matter, most 
of the other high mammals. 

Over ithe past twenty years, human 
feet had probably walked in this al- 
ley ten or twelve times, very likely 
less than that. I might have been the 
second. It was a robot area, a work- 
ing place,' not like the stevedore 
stages where the descendants of men 
whose muscles had once provided 
necessities for them and their famil- 
ies still play-acted the earning of a 
living. 

A robot found the body, its sen- 
sors identified it as possibly 
human (confused, no doubt, by its 
failure to radiate heat) and it had 



requested a management decision. 
Management decisions were furnish- 
ed by watchmen (custodial special- 
ists) who resp>onded to such calls — 
when, as and if there were any. 

I would have to get a statement 
from the man. In the meantime, I 
went through the alley again If I 
were asked what were the most im- 
portant differences between human 
beings and robots, my profession 
would have forced me to say, “Ro- 
bots are neat.” 

Not always, but exceptions were 
accidental: leaking oil, possibly paint 
scraped off going around a comer 
where specified clearances did not 
obtain and the like. But essentially 
they were neat. They didn’t leave 
litter, like cigarette butts, nor were 
they careless. Nor stupid, if they 
were properly programmed. 

My runner was parked at the end 
of the alley. It couldn’t enter unless 
I used my overriding controls, be- 
cause there were no guide tracks 
here. I was hardened to such things 
by my occupation, and I didn’t mind 
a walk of a couple of hundred me- 
ters. (My secret was, it was easier 
to move around on the job than to 
spend time in a gymnasium — and 
much more productive.) I wanted 
light, so I went back to the bug and 
removed one of the headlights (that 
was another extra on a police ma- 
chine) and carried it back on its ex- 
tension cord. 

The alley was bare and clean. The 
sheet metal roof of one of the low 
buildings was crushed where the 
body had fallen on it. In giving, it 
had protected the corpse, so I was 
grateful.

There was a fourteen month old 
fax sheet that I tonged up; most 
likely just wind-blown debris. I was 
ready to leave when I saw something 
else, lying near the spot where the 
corpse had been. It hadn’t been there 
when I came in, I had looked that 
area over carefully, so it might have 
been in or on the body, and dis- 
lodged when it was removed. It 
could have come from the murder 
scene. I tonged it. 

A piece of paper. No, cardboard. 
About three or four millimeters wide, 
less than half that thick and some 
twenty millimeters long. One end 
was burned, the other had been torn. 
Far too small to carry a meaningful 
fingerprint, and the odds were that 
any fragments would be, at best, 
blurred. What manner of thing was 
it? 

I directed routine autopsy and 
identification procedures, and advis- 
ed that I would not want the results 
before ten the next morning. I went 
home and back to bed. On the way, 
I also directed that the alley be 
sealed off, and that robot cleaners be 
sent in with directions to turn over 
anything not necessarily found in 
such a place to my office. Which 
meant me. 

Last, I left a “first-thing” call for 
my secretary. I didn’t know why, but 
I had a bothersome feeling. Call it 
a premonition, call it a male mani- 
festation of the old maid syndrome 
(after all, I was a bachelor; at the 
age of forty-seven, a professional 
bachelor), call it anything you want, 
but as for me, it warned me to leave 
no tern unstoned and save up bricks 
for the seagulls, early in the game. 



I went back to bed, but I couldn’t 
sleep. Perhaps I would have, but 
I couldn’t get my mind out of that 
alley, away from that boy. 

Somebody once told me that I was 
a misogynist, a woman hater. I pre- 
tended to think about the idea, then 
announced that it was false, untrue, 
even libelous. I was impartial. I was 
not a misogynist, I was a misan- 
thrope. I hated everybody. 

I did. I hated people. Not persons, 
people, the milling, filthy mobs. 
There was so much good in the worst 
of us, and all that. But that part 
wasn’t in control when we got to- 
gether in groups. 

I never understood why the ma- 
chine picked me for my job. In one 
way I did, of course. Who was bet- 
ter qualified than I to catch a mur- 
derer? But there were others who 
were cleverer, more quick witted 
and nimble tongued, better persuad- 
ers, with pleasanter personalities. 
Was it only because I was me, be- 
cause I learned the lesson that I was 
diminished in the loss of any of my 
fellow men? Because I had had to 
learn that lesson? 

Why did I so fear and hate all 
death — except my own? 

I lay on my bed until dawn light- 
ed my room. My apartment was my 
only ostentation. Larger than I need- 
ed, although by no means as large 
as my position entitled me to, high 
in the city above dome level and 
open to the morning sun. I had three 
full rooms, my four meter by three 
meter bedroom, my office (five met- 
ers long) and my “other” room for 
necessary social functions, decorated 
as an old-fashioned living room.

IF 




I'he other paraphernalia beloved 
by my forerunners was disposed of. 
M’Pher, who had the position brief- 
ly just before me, actually had a hu- 
man operate his bug — and that a 
special, oversize monster he called 
an “official limousine.” I did not 
have to add to my own honor and 
prestige, and therefore I reduced 
such things in keeping with my hav- 
ing work to do. 

Besides, I was fat and forty — 
and bald. Such things merely made 
me look ridiculous. Amend that. 
More ridiculous. 

II 

I was sitting on the side of my bed, 
trying to decide whether to give 
up my pretense and admit that I 
was awake, or force myself to lie 
down again, when the Vise chime 
sounded. It would have to be Betty, 
answering my call. I said “Hello” 
and she came on. There was no pic- 
ture; I didn’t hold with having a 
’vision pickup in the bedroom. Pri- 
marily because I let myself go to 
seed. I was no vision, just a sight. 

Her voice was bright, cheerful, 
stimulating and therefore altogether 
an obscenity at that hour. “What’s 
up, boss?” she a^ked, as if she damn- 
ed well didn’t know. This time I’d 
fix her, her and her antique mania. 
I’d gone through the same phase my- 
self, a long time ago, and I remem- 
bered the perfect phrase: 

“We’ve got a live one.” Ideal, mid- 
twentieth trite verbiage. 

I could almost hear her strip gears 
mentally, whatever that meant (it 
was another of those expressions, 



having to do with putting a machine 
hors de combat somehow). Of 
course, she was a person. Her sec- 
retary was a robot. She boggled at 
the expression I used, then recog- 
nized it as indicating that we had 
a critical emergency. 

An emergency, naturally, was any 
situation which required immediate 
correction. A critical emergency was 
one where things would get worse 
rapidly, while a non-critical did not 
promise further decay. 

“What sort?” 

I did like her. She was smart, 
reliable, flexible and even quite at- 
tractive. Luckily, she never found 
out how to make the most of her 
good points. Homicide department 
was no place for happily married 
people. Homicide department was no 
place for happy people. At least, we 
never had any. 

“Kid. Boy, specifically. Post pub- 
erty, pre fuU physical growth matur- 
ity. Estimated age, seventeen, plus 
two . minus one. Violent murder. Ab- 
dominal stab wound, marks of beat- 
ing. Precise cause of death undeter- 
mined. Found by robot in warehouse 
area.” 

“No chance of accident?” 

“He had been stripped as naked 
as a peeled egg. Not a stitch on him, 
no trace of his clothing. Dumped 
from a copter. Oh, yes, his head was 
shaved. All his hair, except his eye- 
brows.” 

“Just his head?” 

I thought back. “Yes.” 

A long pause, while she thought 
Freudian thoughts. I knew she would 
come to the same conclusion I had 
when he shaw the body.

When she was ready, I continued, 
“I asked for a report at ten, but it’s 
probably finished now. I ordered a 
quick freeze until the next of kin can 
take the delecti off our hands, of 
course.” She didn’t need to answer, 
so she didn’t. What I was describing 
was as routine as eating breakfast. 

I left her there and went into the 
bath. The shower came on as she 
s|X)ke to me again, but the ’phone 
compensated by increasing volume. 
Naturally, I didn’t have a ’vision 
pickup in the bath, either. Many did. 
“Any ideas?” she asked. 

“Only the obvious, and it’s still 
quite possible.” A jealous husband, 
or more likely boy friend. A man 
whose woman was cooling off, and 
who resented finding out why. But 
why the beating? Ninety per cent of 
the time, anyone caught with another 
male’s female just runs. 

It might have been that he had 
no way to escape. Or he could have 
made the mistake of getting caught 
with his pants only half off. If there 
were a fight, that kind of fight, 
though, it shouldn’t have lasted long 
enough to account for all the dam- 
age. He looked as if someone, or 
some two or more, had kicked him 
around while he was helpless. 

Betty didn’t say another word 
while I washed and shaved. When I 
entered my office, her full-length 
image was on the screen. She didn’t 
look at me. She faced me, but she 
had dialed a different picture and 
now she manipulated a hand control 
so that she could turn the subject 
around and examine all sides, all 
features. 



Finally she switched it off. “I go 
along with everything you said,” she 
agreed. No mean admissiem. She 
meant what I had thought as well as 
what I had spoken. I had four sec- 
retaries before I found one who 
would fight with me to my satisfac- 
tion. Not physically, of course; we 
rarely see each other personally. 

The last commissioner of homi- 
cide, M’Pher, had had a mammoth 
organization. Mammoths couldn’t 
have been too well organized — they 
were extinct. So when I was pulled 
in from the outside I made changes. 

Where there had been at least 
twenty persons rep>orting directly, 
there was now one secretary. The 
number of people in my department, 
compared to the wildest dreams of a 
commissioner in the early days of 
scientific investigation, would not 
have been believed. And in the fact 
that I had managed to reduce the 
administration materially — well, 
that hadn’t happened since Gideon. 

I had the same kind of artillery 
Gideon had. 

I hadn’t let anyone go. Good men 
were hard to find and dedicated men 
almost impossible. That was the 
truth, even with twenty-five or thirty 
to apply for every valid job that 
opened. Here was I, in a real posi- 
tion, and I didn’t even ask for it! 
Halh! 

The number of cases per capita of 
population wouldn’t have been be- 
lieved a few years back, either. It 
was small. Murder was not popular, 
these days. There were a go^ num- 
ber of reasons. One of them was that 
murder wasn’t easy to get away 
with any more.

IF 




T here was a time, say in the trou- 
bled twentieth, when many kill- 
ings simply weren’t recognized. That 
was practically ended when a trained 
post-mortem of body and surround- 
ings was made for each and every 
death. There had to be some kind of 
use for all the surplus manpower. 

Investigation was improved, step 
by step. Robots were handy; they 
could pick up a specimen without 
contaminating it with their own life 
processes. In this case, except for 
the watchman who confirm^ the 
finding of the body and checked to 
insure that it was probably dead, no 
human hand had touched the corpse 
since the murderer pushed it out of 
his cab. 

I assumed that he did have a cab, 
but that was safe. The number of 
private machines in this part of City 
was so small as to be negligible, not 
more than twenty or thirty thousand, 
including those like mine that were 
official duty cars, used by service- 
men or inspectors for the various 
public systems. 

City was a big place. The north- 
ern extreme was called Bangor, the 
other end Key West. It wasn’t con- 
tinuous, of course. The segment that 
was my beat covered what used to 
be northern Rhode Island and east- 
ern Massachhsetts, centering more 
or less over Taunton. 

We had many domes, not one. 
Everything from Warwick through 
the Attleboros came under one patch- 
work monster, and an irregular trail 
staggered off northward to the Bos- 
ton complex, while another hooked 
east over Taunton to Fall River, New 
Bedford and parts of Cape Cod. 



All this was my beat. I was com- 
missioner. I investigated every mur- 
der that took place, up to a dozen 
a year. 

Only a dozen. Two hundred years 
ago, when the population was a third 
of what I had, there might have been 
two or three dozen a year just in 
Boston. 

There was more to the reduction 
of homicide than just having plenty 
of policemen. Part of it was, well, 
public relations. Press agentry, they 
used to call it. “Murderers get 
caught.” The lesson started in gram- 
mar school. 

“Killers can’t get away.” Oh, some 
still tried, and any kind of investiga- 
tion was less than perfect. But if 
somebody did manage, he certainly 
couldn’t go around bragging. 

That was what I did with my 
excess personnel. Training. Visiting 
schools, athletic clubs and any and 
every place where the young held 
out. When an adult needed retrain- 
ing, he’d be turned over to someone 
perhaps more forceful than I. He 
was restrained very effectively. Right 
from scratch. 

Just as I was. 

I set my department up on a cell 
basis. Most cases I didn’t deal with 
myself, except to meddle around at 
the start. There was an old question: 
Quis custodiet ipsos custodies? I 
did. The machine watched me. I 
didn’t care who watched the ma- 
chine. 

m 

I had been sitting back, watching 
Betty. Let us be frank: she was 
an old maid. I was an old bachelor.

which sounded a lot nicer, but to all 
practical ends added up to equiva- 
lents. Betty and I understood each 
other. But just the same we liked 
each other, so I imagine we were 
friends. 

She’d never had a man. Certainly 
not full time, and I suspected never 
at all. She was no prude, however. 
If she had been neo-Vic, she wouldn’t 
have been able to take the hard 
knocks her job gave her. That “mod- 
esty” nonsense that was so dominant 
in public thinking was, to us, for 
the birds. 

She had been examining our cus- 
tomer. I was curious to find out what 
she had noticed that I hadn’t, how 
her opinions agreed with mine and 
where they differed. As I said, she 
was strong-willed, and if she didn’t 
see things the same way I did, she’d 
let me know. Quickly, sharply, and 
without any pretense of respect. I 
could Jiave loved her. I probably did, 
but I needed her too much to admit 
it. 

I watched her, not him. I had seen 
him, even though he hadn’t been set 
up for display then. I had seen him 
as he had been found, and I didn’t 
want to change my mental picture 
until I had extracted all the data 
from it that was to be had. 

I hadn’t touched the body. I didn’t 
expect to, for all of that. Most likely, 
no human hands would ever contact 
it again. 

Betty ^switched to me and asked, 
“Do you want me to punch in my 
own description?” 

Of course I did, and she knew it. 
She was doing so. 

Her asking was an apology for not 




54 



IF 






speaking to me immediately. I was 
perfectly content to wait. I punched 
the order-^transmit stud and asked for 
the identification of the body. 

The green light on my wall that 
meant the computer was operating 
flashed, and the datascreen lighted. 
The words appeared, “Subject not 
registered.” I pushed Cancel, then 
Query. Was it a malfunction? 

The reply to Query came imme- 
diately. The datascreen lighted again, 
this time with “Functioning normal- 
ly.” 

T ordered a new identification 
search, and waited. Before, the time 
needed had varied between barely 
perceptible and a half second. Now 
it stayed on in the green. Ten sec- 
onds, twelve, fifteen. After twenty- 
two seconds, the screen lighted again. 
“Subject not registered.” 

“Subject not registered.” That 
meant there was no record anywhere 
on Earth, accessible to the computer, 
of the person who had become our 
dead body. No birth certificate 
(which would have carried finger- 
prints), no school records, no credit 
cards, nothing. 

Betty watched her screen, too. 
They were hooked up in parallel 
when we talked, so that both would 
have the same supplementary infor- 
mation. Her face was pale. Mine was 
probably white. 

“Data request, all missing persons 
who come within ninety per cent 
of characteristics of subject.” In 
other words, how many people were 
there whose whereabouts we didn’t 
know, who might have been mistaken 
for the dead boy? That would take 
a few seconds. Tt did. Seven. The list 



BIRCHER 



55 



of names ran up the screens, and 
the machine had been generous. Af- 
ter each name, a per cent. The Grst 
was ninety-seven point thirteen; the 
last ninety point zero one. 

“Betty, this time we earn our keep. 
Oh, yes, under the circumstances, I 
think I’m justified in putting our 
wonder boy — or boy wonder — un- 
der permanent hold.” I did. I didn’t 
do it often — never if the identifica- 
tion were quick unless there were 
something that looked strange, or 
some data that might be needed. 

After all, cemetery space was 
scarce. It certainly wasn’t fair for a 
person to lock up almost a hundred 
kilos of perfectly reusable biological 
materials after he was done with 
them. Normal disposal was by cre- 
mation, with the ashes turned over 
to the next of kin if he wanted them. 
That way, most of the substance was 
reclaimed from the exhausted gases. 
Most of the time what was left 
wasn’t wanted either, and the whole 
thing was recycled. 

When there was a question, 
though, it was a good idea to keep 
the evidence on hand. 

The work and expense of embalm- 
ing were substantially lessened. It 
was once a difficult, expensive and 
time-consuming process, and the 
structure and mechanics of the body 
were so extensively changed that the 
advisability, from a practical stand- 
point, wasn’t great. Anciently — very 
anciently — processing the remains 
took over a month. All the internal 
organs were removed and -the entire 
thing was treated with bitumen. (The 
word “mummy” meant pitch. Did 
you know?) 



By early modem times, say 
late eighteenth to early twentieth 
centuries, this treatment was faster 
and better. So much better that a 
post-mortem performed on John Paul 
Jones a century after his death veri- 
fied the original physician’s opinion. 
It was still rare for a body to be 
treated this way and quite expensive. 
It would be honest also to say that 
it was rare for the treatment to be 
that effective. 

For us it was very fast and cheap. 
A coffin was taken 'from stock, a 
glass tube, open at one end and a 
flattened ellipsoid in cross section. 
The corpse was put inside, the tube 
filled with salt water and its open 
end sealed with a glass plate fused 
in place. 

TTie specimen was irradiated, not 
in a pile but in a high voltage elec- 
tron gadget, so that body, support- 
ing fluid and transparent coffin were 
sterilized. Glass was impenetrable by 
microorganisms, and the boy would 
not require further attention until he 
were removed for incineration, or 
the glass broken. 

I turned to Betty. The list of names 
still glowed on the datascreens. 
“Well?” I asked. She looked at the 
list, then back at me. She weighed 
facts and considered alternatives, in- 
cluding resignation. She gave in. 

“Suppose I take half,” she volun- 
teered. 

“Good girl.” It wouldn’t be fun. 
She’d be ’vising people, telling them 
that, although according to the com- 
puter it couldn’t be their son, broth- 
er or sweetheart we had, we were 
establishing identity for a body, and 



56 



IF 




i^uld they care to make a positive 
identification, either negative or af- 
firmative? It would not be true to 
say that tact was required. Tact 
wouldn’t be enough. A strong stom- 
ach would be necessary. 

I took the top half of the list. 
They’d be closer misses, since the 
descriptions more nearly tallied. 

In a few minutes the body would 
be ready, I waited for the door 
chime. (Yes, I was keeping it in 
my apartment. Where else?) I set it 
up so that the scanners viewed it 
up from about the diaphragm. If it 
had been female. I’d have dollied in 
on the upper shoulders. 

My predecessor, old M’Pher, had 
been neo- Victorian, or at least he 
let the neo-Vics run him, and he had 
any bodies that were bottled dressed 
first. I didn’t. Not to save the cost 
of clothing, but because there might 
be an injury, a scar or a birthmark 
that clothing would hide. A couple 
of centuries back, a spy — in case 
the word is strange, it means a kind 
of p>olitical criminal — was caught 
because he tried to substitute for a 
person who had been circumcised. 
The spy hadn’t. 

The kid wasn’t pretty in the tube. 
His face still showed stark terror. 
He must have waited, expecting 
death, perhaps for hours or even 
days. He was ugly with bruises, from 
one of his eyes that had been black- 
ened on down to his wrists and 
ankles that were rubbed raw. He had 
been gagged, too. 

It was a shame. Not for what he 
was — I never believed that he was 
first class citizen material — but for 
what he might have been. 



He floated in the water. It was 
somewhat salty, to match his natural 
blood chemistry. That way there 
wouldn’t be any tendency for water 
either to seep into the body or leach 
out. We didn’t want him swelling 
or shriveling. There wasn’t any chem- 
ical need for water, but it supported 
him. If he were left lying in "an 
empty tube, his weight would flatten 
tissues, change his appearance. That 
doesn’t happen to living people, be- 
cause they don’t really stay still in 
one posture long. But he would. 

As soon as Betty was tied in, so 
that she could project the same pic- 
ture of him that I showed, I asked 
for the names and ’vise numbers of 
the next of kin. It was just as bad a 
job as I was afraid it would be. 
There were altogether too many who 
wanted to believe the worst. 

There were even more who were 
too curious, who wanted to take 
over the remote pickup and run their 
own examinations. I didn’t dislike 
persons, but I hate people. I was 
not squeamish. I didn’t care if I em- 
barrassed every neo-Vic in the coun- 
try; if it would have helped me find 
his killer I would have showed his 
bare backside and equally naked 
frontside to every man, woman and 
child in Greater North America. But 
I still didn’t like either the carelessly 
inquisitive nor the sensation seeker. 

I n the end, it was negative. I asked 
for the next ten per cent, but 
these I took in groups, with a con- 
ference bridge on the ’visor circuits. 
It meant that I couldn’t see faces, 
but there were other benefits to be 
realized from it.

There is a distribution curve, a 
“bean” curve, that meant that as the 
number of percentage points of simi- 
larity decreased, the number of pos- 
sibilities — missing people — would 
increase rapidly toward a peak. From 
seventy per cent down, we sent post- 
cards, with three dimensional photo- 
graphs. We kept right on going down 
to cellar level, covering every person 
missing on planet Earth for the last 
hundred fifty years. I even got one. 

I sent a note to the Asteroid Le- 
gation, as well. It shouldn’t have been 
possible for him to be an off-worlder, 
a Moon boy or conie, because we 
should have received records of his 
coming in, with passport photos and 
ID prints, but I couldn’t reject mere 
improbabilities. After all, we were 
supposed to be unstoppable. 

It would be plenty bad if we didn’t 
find the killer; but if we couldn’t 
even find out who the victim was, 
it’d be much worse. I wouldn’t have 
to worry about it long. At least not 
professionally, because it’d be some- 
one else’s problem. I wouldn’t be 
commissioner any more. 

I knew someone who would like 
that very much. 

The department would be hit 
where it would be hurt the most, in 
the reputation. Our success in pre- 
venting crimes was responsible for 
much of our success in solving them. 
The last time a murder had gone de- 
tected and unsolved, it had started a 
landslide with thirty-three separate 
removals in a single year. 

“Removals” was a euphemism. 

One factor that made it difficult 
to hide a crime was our speed and 
efficiency in identification. A per- 



son’s fingerprints were recorded at 
birth. Then they were checked every 
six months when he turned in his 
credit card. At the ages of five, seven, 
ten, fourteen, eighteen, twenty-two, 
twenty-eight, thirty-five and fifty, his 
Bertillon measurements were record- 
ed for statistics. 

Money was a commodity most 
people, except antique nuts, never 
heard of. The reason was that our 
society was too rich to afford it. We 
had something better. 

True enough. Go way back when 
— say to medieval or renaissance 
times. People were poor. The way we 
looked at it, even the rich were poor. 
The Borgia and Medici families 
couldn’t afford strawberries in Jan- 
uary. The amounts of gold and silver 
available were almost constants. The 
accumulation from year to year was 
tiny. Back then, with people gener- 
ally without wealth, it was feasible 
to melt down the metals and make 
money — tokens of value — from it. 

Actual wealth increased year by 
year, faster than the people to share 
it. It came partly from exploitation 
of new sources, partly by profit 
realized on past investments, partly 
from better use of man’s muscle and 
brain power. Ships, for instance, sail- 
ed faster, were more likely to reach 
port and carried larger cargoes. The 
greater profit encouraged heavier 
investments. 

With wealth increasing, the need 
for symbols of value overstepped the 
availability of precious metals. Sub- 
stitutes were found, sometimes even 
produce like tobacco, but paper was 
the first adequate replacement. By 
the twentieth century it pushed gold 



58 



IF 




out of circulation. By then silver had 
become too useful for such a value- 
less purpose. 

P aper money had started on its way 
out before it was really in, re- 
placed by a couple of new inventions 
applied to something older than the 
Merchant of Venice: credit. The 
computer could do the work of un- 
countable clerks, do it fast, do it 
cheap and do it with little likelihood 
of error. Especially when credit 
cards were used. 

Credit cards. They became the 
universal symbol of worth. An un- 
sung genius started using them to 
print with magnetic inks, so the 
computers could read them without 
human assistance and error. 

Once they were issued by practi- 
cally every company, just as once 
almost any bank had printed its own 
money. With a credit card for each 
purp>ose, for use in a single store or 
to purchase auto fuel from a single 
chain of vendors, they multiplied 
unchecked until one person might 
carry a dozen or twenty of them. 

Then they became a Government 
monopoly, and our prime weapon, 
outside of the people . on our staff. 
Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, 
except maybe » the birchers and stil- 
yegi (that was during their time). 
No^V each person carried one. It was 
purposeless to steal one, because for 
any purchase of value it was still 
necessary to scrawl a signature, and 
the life of the card was limited. 

The cards weren’t all the same, by 
any means. Mine was blue and yel- 
low. Depending on the way I put it 
in the slot, I could charge purchases 



either to my own account or my de- 
partment. Others had the same fea- 
ture, but their charges were reviewed 
by their superiors. 

Most people had the plain green 
cards of the private citizen, or the 
red of restricted credit, and there 
were the yellow of the pensioner and 
the white of the minor child. 

They were handy for us.. Whatever 
you — anyone purchased, in services 
or material objects, was charged by 
them. A person couldn’t view a fax 
sheet outside his home, mount a 
walkway, take a cab or buy a dispo- 
suit without a card. That meant he 
couldn’t make a getaway or disguise 
himself without leaving a printed rec- 
ord. 

Unlike taxis, there was no charge 
for walkways. But safety’s sake re- 
quired limited access, and before a 
person could get on the moving belts, 
he had to slip his card into a slot. 
That way the computers know just 
how many people there are on each 
route, so they can adjust speeds and 
directions to prevent traffic prob- 
lems. True? 

There were violet credit cards, 
that were used by machines to make 
purchases. 

The credit card was the real wea- 
pon against the criminal. 

Incidentally, when I said “crimi- 
nal,” I meant murderer. I was a 
specialist. 

IV 

M y admission chime sounded 
from the front door. “Open,” 

I ordered, and Betty came in. This 
was the third time that she had been 



BIRCHER 



59 




in my apartment office in the four- 
teen years she had worked with me, 
and the fifth time we had met face 
to face. 

I was expecting her. I figured she 
was as bothered as I was. 

She walked to the boy. His tube 
coffin was standing in the corner of 
the room, away from the wall. It 
was/>n a bearing so that it could be 
turned freely, and she pushed it to 
start it revolving. “Pity,” she said, 
her first word since she entered. 

I wondered why. Did she, like me, 
resent the world losing the possible 
benefits he might have brought, had 
he lived out his life? Did she feel 
sympathy for the boy’s parents, his 
possible brothers and sisters, or his 
probable girl friend? Or was it the 
evidence of sadism, the inflicting of 
pain and injury on him because it 
was sweet to his torturer? 

I wouldn’t ask. I was afraid that 
it might be simply the loss of a male, 
of the affection and sex she might 
never have known, when she could 
have made such pleasant use of them. 

T did not criticize her hunger. We 
who worked for homicide were mis- 
erable, wretched people, sick of the 
world and sick with the world. Was 
I in my own heart afraid that if I 
were not so twisted as I was, I would 
no longer know happiness? I was too 
full of the milk of human kindness, 
and in me it had gone sour. 

She stepped back. “He was bound 
and gagged while he was still alive.” 

Not only that, he had fought to 
get loose. His wrists were raw and 
bloody, and his ankles were bruised 
from struggling, and the gag had 
torn his mouth. He might have been 



unattended for some time after his 
capture. 

His body had been washed. He 
had been at least partially covered 
some time during his torture, because 
the traces of blood over his abdomen 
showed a curious weave pattern 
where it had glued material to his 
body. It could have been a tarp or 
something of the sort, instead of 
clothing. 

The wound was over eight centi- 
meters below the navel. Whether or 
not it was made to kill, it was made 
to cause pain, so it was kept well 
away from the critical areas, such as 
the heart. He must have been lying 
flat on his back, because the blood 
had run down to the crotch and then 
down again to whatever surface he 
had been lying on. In back, he show- 
ed red all the way up to the nape 
of the neck. 

His scalp was shaved. That was 
curious. No — I was curious, that 
was strange. Betty confirmed my 
thinking. “Possibly a symbolic cas- 
tration.” 

“Um,” I agreed, then, “I wonder 
why the symbolism? There was noth- 
ing at all preventing the real thing.” 
True. He had been gagged, and 
therefore unable to scream any more 
in agony than in terror. He had been 
bound, and could neither fight nor 
escape. He had undoubtedly tried 
all three. 

I ordered a credit-card check of 
all copters that had crossed the ware- 
house area less than two days before 
the body was found, against a list 
of the relatives, friends, etc., of miss- 
ing people. That would take hours of 
computer time, but it was a must. 



60 



IF 




T he key to the problem was the 
identity of the victim. I wrote 
off my first guess, that it was a sex- 
linked crime. 

If the corpse were supposed to re- 
main an unknown, the clothing 
might have been removed because it 
would tell too much. It would not 
have been possible to provide other 
raiment, because the purchase would 
be traceable. Credit cards were used 
for everything from bubble gum to 
asteroid ships, and it was impossible 
to buy anything and not leave a rec- 
ord of who bought it. 

I was bothered by something, 
bothered very much. I had come to 
a conclusion, made a deduction from 
valid facts. What annoyed me was 
that I didn’t know what it was. 

What was I hiding from myself? 
And why was I hiding it? 

I was the introspective sort. I 
knew that, it made my life a hell on 
Earth. The only thing I really knew 
right then was 'that I was getting a 
world’s record headache. A jim- 
dandy skull splitter. The description 
occurred to me, and gave me anoth- 
er source of wonder. Why was I 
starting to spout these ancient gems 
of hackney? I had outgrown my own 
antique mania twenty^five years ago. 

I must have looked tired, because 
I hadn’t slept. I skipped breakfast, 
too, but that was nothing. I missed 
a lot of meals and still stayed fat. 

The fax dispenser chimed and 
started to read out. The chime meant 
that information of interest to me 
was included; other than that, I’m 
keyed for random read-outs, since I 
am heavy on coincidences and long 
chances (except gambling). 



I didn’t look at it. It was already 
mid-afternoon, and there was so 
much that I hadn’t done. There was 
a report on the body to read; I was 
trying to find a murderer without 
knowing what had killed the victim, 
and when. The fax sheets could be 
of no interest. There was only one 
thing of importance to me in this 
bitter world, and that was to get my 
man. 

Or to have him gotten. I released 
the case to the entire department. 
If I were a telepath, I could have felt 
the sigh of relief and the salivation 
of eagerness from the dozen or more 
warped souls who were the artillery 
of homicide. They were like me; 
there would never be rest while the 
job was to be done. 

I was the commissioner. It was 
my right to take over a case when it 
interested me, or to let whomsoever 
I would have the joy. That was about 
the only pleasure that any of us felt, 
ever, the thrill of the chase. I won- 
dered, casually, what the German 
word would be for the pleasure of 
the hunt. Something incorporating 
Jagt, I suppose, and Lust, Jagt- 
lust,” most likely. 

Now I gave the puzzle to every- 
one. Immediately the datascreen 
showed me that one, two, an unde- 
termined number, were picking up 
the reins. The body started to turn 
as eager eyes began their examina- 
tion, hoping that there was some 
mote of a clue that had escaped the 
old man. 

The restrictions on the observa- 
tions of outsiders hardly applied to 
department members. I hoped, for 
the sake of the boy, that there were 



BIRCHER 



61 




no remnants of modesty. Somehow, 
and I wished I knew why, I was 
quite sure that, even alive, no one 
would have called him shy or ex- 
pected any kind of treatment to em- 
barrass him — or hoped to find any 
other decency, either. 

B etty went to my other room and 
got me a drink, probably one 
of those niid-twentieth horrors that 
were so popular again, a martini or 
screwdriver or something, I didn’t 
know what, but it was big and had a 
high proportion of alcohol. I wasn’t 
a drinking man. Ordinary vices didn’t 
entertain me, nor did I retain my 
fondness for antiques. 

I didn’t suppose Betty drank much, 
either, but she was enamored of 
relics of days gone by, as well as 
the hope of some day having a male 
of her own. This that she gave me 
was big and cold. She called it a 
“zombie.” 

I supposed that I looked dead 
enough to qualify — but it wouldn’t 
have been a department matter since 
I hadn’t been killed. Not that there 
wasn’t somebody willing. 

I drank and in a few minutes went 
to sleep in a chair. One reason why 
I didn’t often use alcohol was be- 
cause I reacted to it as to any other 
anesthetic. 

I dreamed. The corpse there in my 
office was ‘laughing at me. No, he 
didn’t come to life or anything, but 
I knew he was laughing. I recogniz- 
ed him both as a type and as an 
individual. He represented a class 
that I didn’t care for, a specific 
brand of young hood, but like all the 
rest of the genera, cheap, vile and 



violent, without respect for the per- 
son and property of another, with 
regard only for the immediate grati- 
fication of his own desires. 

I was almost glad he was dead. 
Of all the people I hated, his was 
the kind I despised most of all. My 
kind. As I had been, not as I was. 

He was more than just a type, 
though. He was an individual, and I 
knew him. I knew him and he knew 
me, and he floated there, laughing 
at me. 

I knew more about him than Betty 
did, even though she had all the in- 
formation I did. There was some- 
thing specific that led me to under- 
stand the dead boy. The only trou- 
ble was, I didn’t know what it was. 

I didn’t know. 

I dreamed, and in my dreaming I 
went back to the alley where he had 
been found. I look^ up, and far 
away the stars laughed at me. Even 
then, I knew, I could have turned 
to the corpse and said, “He’s — .” 
I wanted to laugh back at the heav- 
ens, because even then I had pene- 
trated their secret, I had known 
what they knew. 

What was it I knew? 

I didn’t know. The corpse wouldn’t 
tell me. The stars wouldn’t tell me. 

**Mica, mica, parva Stella; Mir or 
quaenam sis tambella; Splendens 
eminis in illo; Alba, vaelut, gemma 
caelo** Was that it, the secret of the 
stars? No, scarcely. After all these 
years, my Latin wouldn’t even have 
been correct, anyway. And that was 
about the first thing I learned, thirty- 
odd years ago, in English, it went, 
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star — .” I 
knew it in that language.

I woke. Betty was gone. I walked 
over to the‘ subject and stared 
at him, eye to eye. I would be damn- 
ed if I’d let him beat me. It would 
please him for me to lose at my little 
project of finding his killer. I had 
the sneaky feeling that he and I had 
less than sympathy for each other. 
Amend that. Would have had. 

The pain, the torment and fear, 
the agony of his dying were still 
written in the contortions of his face, 
in his clenched fists and staring eyes. 

I punched the key for the robo- 
surg’s report, and let it run once 
across the datascreen without any 
pauses. 

On the second trip, I went through 
each item carefully, looking for 
something there that bothered me. 
It had found its way into the back 
of my mind and joined the other 
facts that were assembled, and added 
its voice to the Greek chorus that 
was there, laughing at me. 

They were laughing along with the 
stars, and the corpse, and his killer. 

I would be damned if I’d let them 
beat me, any of them. I’d be replaced 
as well; that was nothing. The honor 
and prestige of my job did not taste 
good to me, I had them too long. I 
lied. How I lied. The department had 
become my life. 

The fax sheet was what I was 
afraid it would be. Headlines from 
one side to the other, “Mystery Body 
Puzzles Police.” 

I told myself that it was really 
high praise. We were expected now, 
as a matter of course, to have the 
solution in only hours. This was al- 



most a day old! I wondered why the 
fax sheets seemed almost to ignore 
the dead boy, in order to heap calum- 
ny on my head. 

They could keep it up for weeks, 
too. It wasn’t often that they got any 
kind of story, and in homicide it had 
been years since the report of an eli- 
mination had not been released wiA- 
in minutes of the arrest of the crim- 
inal. There was another faptbr, too. 
The editor was a man who did not 
love me. He was M’Pher, who had 
been homicide commissioner for 
only a few months when the ma- 
chines removed him and inserted 
me. 

M y memory flashed back to gram- 
mar school days. That was 
something the years changed little, 
the children assembling away from 
their homes for classes. The system 
would have been cheaper abandoned, 
but the results would not be good. 
People had to learn to live tog^her, 
and the schools were the only place 
that taught that. 

Automation had brought back 
what was once known as “cottage 
industry,” except that we didn’t have 
enough cottages to be worth count- 
ing. A man’s apartment was his cas- 
tle, and also his workshop, whether 
he put words on tape or performed 
microrepairs on one-of-a-kind elec- 
tronics circuit. Or tied dry flies for 
fishing, for all of that. 

A child was brought into the 
world through the affection, inten- 
tion or negligence of its parents, and 
lived with them alone until it was 
six years old. It played in super- 
vised areas perhaps, and went with 



BIRCHER

its mother or father shopping some- 
times, and that was all. (At that it 
was lucky, compared to earlier gen- 
erations where father was just a 
strange commuting creature who 
came home after dark, left to catch 
a train before dawn and slept with 
mother.) 

I thought about my own indoc- 
trination lectures. The homicide com- 
missioner then was many steps far- 
ther back than MTher, and his pic- 
ture decorated the hall. We were 
told stories about the department’s 
cunning, perseverance, craft and 
perspicacity. 

We were taught very carefully 
how important it was that we respect 
other people, and not do them dam- 
age either willfully or through neg- 
ligence. 

We were taught that the one real 
crime was not asking for help if we 
needed it, failing to recognize the 
shortcomings — quick temper, exag- 
gerated responses, vindictiveness — 
that meant that we needed psychia- 
tric aid, to prevent our wanting to 
kill or maim. We were taught that, 
if we would not live with our fellow 
men, perhaps we should live away 
from them, say beyond the asteroids. 

I was one in whom the lectures 
did not bear fruit. Betty was an- 
other. I knew where there was a 
third, close to me, laughing at me. 

He laughed the louder at that. 
No, not him. 7 was laughing. It was 
my own amusement, my own sar- 
casm, my own bitterness, that I was 
imputing to the corpse. He hadn’t 
felt anything, anything at all, in 
days. Had he? What was so impor- 
tant about that question? 



I ran through the report again, 
looking for something. Yes! A para- 
graph, starting with the comment 
that there was some indication of 
recent sexual activity — scarcely 
news, when a healthy male dies vio- 
lently, he often has an ejaculation — 
but ^men reserves were not de- 
pleted. Then the kicker, three words 
that should have been in flickering 
red, “sperm motility — zero.” 

I laughed now, at my uncon- 
scious. So that was his secret! 

The fax sheets had a time with 
me. Within three days they were 
calling for my “voluntary” resigna- 
tion. After a week, they dropped the 
voluntary part of it, and in ten days 
they had forgotten about resigning. 
Had MTher forgotten that that was 
the only way my job can be vacated? 
Scarcely, because he wasn’t ma- 
chine-picked, and he was ousted by 
the computers. 

MTher was a political appointee. 
He had his place only while the per- 
son the machines wanted wasn’t 
available. 

Retraining wasn’t an overnight 
deal. 

I t was a week before the idea pene- 
trated to some creep that if one 
person could get away with murder, 
two could. He either wasn’t as smart 
or as lucky as my unknown killer. 
In his case the announcement of 
the apprehension of the killer was 
made within seconds of the news of 
the crime. 

It gave the fax sheets more am- 
munition against me. 

They were altogether too violent. 
M’Pher was editorializing on the 



64 



IF 




front page about my incompetence, 
and the inability of a machine to 
pick the right man for such an im- 
portant job. 

The fax sheets dropped below 
decent minima. I had ceased reading 
them, just let the ribbons of plastic 
issue from the slot and disappear 
into the waste box. 

With all the weapons the depart- 
ment has, such as free and unlim- 
ited access to computer data and 
systems, to the records compiled all 
over the face of the Earth during the 
last fifty years, to the fussy analysis 
equipment and examination proced- 
ures that almost pick the memory 
of a single molecule, the most im- 
portant single factor went complete- 
ly unnoticed. 

That factor was the people man- 
ning the department. The unhappy, 
twisted, tormented satires of hu- 
manity who made it their life to 
track down the broken vessels who 
shatter the lives of others. We ran, 
night and day, without pause. We 
hated each other, we hated human- 
ity, and all because we, each of us, 
hated ourselves. 

Hate was the tension that made 
us go. It was the force that propelled 
us, as a stressed mainspring had 
once driven the movement of a 
watch. Or better, as the Romans 
had once twisted to drive the cata- 
pults, the ballistas and onagers that 
were their weapons of war against 
fortified cities. What was the name 
applied to all kinds of throwing 
devices powered that way? I forgot. 
No, I didn’t, either. The word was 
“torquati.” 

But that’s what we were, the ar- 



tillery of homidde department 

Run, killer, run. You’re a person, 
and we’re only machines. Run, kill- 
er. Run. We’ll still follow. 

Run, killer. We hate you. 

Now the fax sheets hated me. 
They hated me so much less than I 
hated me, they could scarcely mat- 
ter. 

Run, killer! You give us some- 
thing to live for. Run! 

Time was to be. I was patient, my 
customer, was patient. His sympathy 
may not have been with me, nor 
mine with him, but he would be 
satisfied. If not, let him tell me. 
There was no point in premature 
action; I had a trail to uncover, and 
it was pleasant not to fight time. 

Beside, I was amused at my de- 
partment. The trick perspective 
played on them was strange. 

The usual reason for dumping a 
body was because it could not be 
hidden. Not so this time! Disposing 
of a person’s remains was not easy. 
But it could be done. I had done 
it myself, a half dozen times or 
more. It was my hobby, trying to 
outguess the computer, and I was 
no amateur. Three times I succeed- 
ed. 

Well, why not? We’d had the 
bodies in permanent hold a half cen- 
tury or more. The odds were that 
the killers had gone to their own 
rewards, and there was certainly 
nothing to be gained by keeping the 
clay of their victims around. Our 
reputation for efficiency was a lot 
older than our efficiency was. 

Time drew near. The brief was 
drawn up, the warrants prepared 
and filed under ’’tentative, hold” 



BIRCHER

and the court trial was scheduled. 
A summary was ready to be 
dropped in the hands of the district 
attorney. There was only one 
trouble. The murder for which the 
trial was the result hadn’t been com- 
mitted. The killer I would have 
prosecuted hadn’t killed. His victim 
still breathed. 

That was an awful problem for a 
homicide commissioner, but I solved 
it manfully. 

I also scheduled the murder, and 
I was ready to provide the victim. 

T ime had come. I stood before 
the corpse and laughed in his 
face. Then I issued my invitations. 

That was social usage. It certainly 
wasn’t normal for one to go to an- 
other’s home; the ’vision screens 
were as good as personal confron- 
tation, or even better. If a person 
were a nuisance, he could be shut 
off. This, on the other hand, would 
be easier on me, and private, as 
well. 

My datascreen lighted; it was 
signalled by an amber light. The ma- 
chine was taking action on its own, 
and my heart stood still. I looked at 
the panel. “Disapprove your ac- 
tions.” That was simple. 

I punched in, “Will you stop 
them?” 

“Reply withheld.” 

I knew what expression was writ- 
ten on my face — ^hatred — ^buit I felt 
relief trickle through and melt the 
horror that I had felt. Perhaps I 
was a pawn of the machine, myself, 
but I, too, was a player in this 
game. I would lay my wager! 

The stage was set. My other room 



was redecorated. I would continue 
my play. 

The three of them came at the 
appointed time. Betty, my secretary; 
his honor, O’Moore, the high mayor; 
and M’Pher, my predecessor, the 
editor. They sat down and looked 
around and stared at each other. 

Betty’s eyes widened in surprise 
at the changes in the room, just as 
they had narrowed in hatred at the 
sight of thin, ascetic M’Pher. M’Pher 
was most astounded. ^ “I never 
dreamed you had such good taste,” 
he admitted. 

I only whispered thanks. By his 
standards, I didn’t have good taste. 
To me, antiques were merely items 
wrongfully spared destruction. The 
room was furnished in what, two 
centuries ago, had been called 
“American Colonial.” It was mid- 
twentieth phony. The furniture was 
supposed to look as if it were made 
of wood, light colored maple, and 
the upholstery resembled printed 
textiles. M’Pher sat by a table where 
an antique flintlock pistol lay. 

“Be careful of that, will you? It’s 
functional.” 

“You mean, you could load and 
fire it?” When he looked at me, I 
could see the four “F’s” in his eyes. 
Forty, fat, feeble and foolish. I ad- 
mitted to all of them — at least the 
appearance. I had been commission- 
er for sixteen years, however. I had 
had more than one adversary. 

“It’s already loaded.” 

“Oh.” He recoiled slightly, then 
examined it closely, but without 
touching it. He was mesmerized, like 
the mythical bird hypnotized by a 
serpent. 



66 



IF 




I wasn’t sure whether he believed 
me or not. I cared less. He had had 
the pistol drawn to his attention. 

His honor sat opposite . me, and 
Betty was at my right hand. That 
was fitting and proper. ''Dulce et 
decorum” I thought, and smiled 
at the rest of the quotation. 

The only set of circumstances 
where it was proper to invite one’s 
superior to a home was to tender 
a resignation. It was neither neces- 
sary nor proper for M’Pher to be 
present, but I would bend propriety 
into a pretzel this night. M’Pher was 
so happy of the chance to rub salt 
in a wound, he accepted eagerly. 

W hen my guests were seated, I 
brought refreshments. That 
was not customary; it was poor taste 
for a person’s boss to accept his 
hospitality just as the rug was being 
pulled out, but O’Moore took the 
glass. He and I had always gotten 
along; he didn’t like me, but I did 
a good job always until now, and I 
wasn’t a politico, trying to spring- 
board from my place to his. 

While they still had their glasses 
up, I excused myself and left the 
room. I went back pushing a tube. 
I was sorry to ruin their appetites 
that way. I di^dn’t realize than any-i 
one, especially not a former com- 
missioner, could be so squeamish. 

“He’s naked!” M’Pher snapped, 
looking at Betty. 

She was innocence. “Why, sure 
enough, he is. Until you said so, I 
hadn’t noticed.” 

M’Pher blushed. The red color 
was not becoming, his regular gray 
suited him much better. So he was 



neo-Vic. I wondered why. That 
prudish act was very common, as 
well as the mania for antiques. 
Neither one was comprehensible. I 
wondered if M’Pher culttered up his 
apartment with chain mail. 

He had his chance to dominate 
the conversation, and let it go. It 
was my turn again. O’Moore looked 
sick. 

I said, simply enough, “I "am sorry 
to go on record as stating that the 
killer of this boy will not be brought 
to trial.” 

“If you hadn’t been such a bung- 
ling jackass,” M’Pher snapped at me, 
“he would have been caught. I’m 
glad you’re man enough to an- 
nounce your incompetence.” 

I star^ at him. I had practiced the 
expression of blankness with an ad- 
mixture of incredulity and a season- 
ing of curiosity. I said, “I beg your 
pardon?” 

His expression was just as read- 
able, but scarcely prearranged — 
open, utter hostility and burning 
hate. “I said. I’m glad you admit 
your incompetence! My readers will 
be glad to know that the homicide 
department is changing its head.” 

Who hated me more, he or I? He 
put a great deal of value on the posi- 
tion I took away from him, far more 
than was justified, and after all these 
years he’d never have a chance to 
get it back. 

“I am very sorry.” I still had to 
be meek and mild. “I made no ad- 
mission of the sort. I merely stated 
that the killer of this boy will not, 
can not, be brought to trial.” 

“Isn’t that the same thing?” 

“By no means. It’s simply that the 

67 



BIRCHER 




killer is outside our jurisdiction. He’s 
dead himself.” 

B etty was fastest on the uptake. 

“You’ve caught the killer!” Her 
face was eager, alert, happy. She was 
a good one. She was happy for me 
in success, and eager to support 
me in my difficulties. 

“Sorry.” I kept my blank expres- 
sion. Then, quietly, “But I know 
who he was. Rather, who one of 
the killers was.” 

The four faces in front of me 
showed four expressions. Betty’s, 
simple joy; O’Moore was incredu- 
lous, and happy too. M’Pher showed 
pained astonishment, as if he just 
discovered that he had swallowed 
his cigar. The other face showed 
only the pain that was the last thing 
it was ever to record. 

M’Pher suddenly wanted to 
change the subject. “Can’t you get 
that thing out of here?” He meant 
the corpse. This neo-Vic modesty 
was a strange phenomenon, just as 
complicated and* unrealistic as the 
real thing back during the late 
eighteen hundreds and very early 
nineteen hundreds. 

During the original Victorian per- 
riod, the word “leg” was never 
breathed; for people, “limb” was 
substituted, and for poultry “drum- 
stick.” A ‘“chair” became a “seat,” 
because it drew attention to the por- 
tion of the anatomy that rested on 
it to refer to it so crudely. 

Nevertheless, public buildings 
were decorated with statues of 
ydung men (but not young women) 



with not even a fig leaf brief, and 
boys went swimming in neighbor- 
hood rivers in the same unconfin- 
ing natural costume. 

“Why?” I asked, as ingenuously 
as Betty. I saw that what bothered 
M’Pher was her presence. She saw 
it too, and started to push back 
toward the corner where she would 
have been less obviously present. 
But I stopped her with a subtle ges- 
ture — she knew me well. “He’s not 
embarrassed. I don’t tipnk he’d blush 
even if he were alive — which he 
hasn’t been for some time.” 

“That’s impossible,” Betty object- 
ed. “There was almost no decom- 
position.” 

I nodded. “True. I took a dif- 
ferent angle, though. What bothered 
me most was why his scalp had been 
shaved. It was inviting to presume 
that he was caught in the act of 
love and killed by a husband, broth- 
er or boy friend. 

“The trouble was, he was dead 
before he was stripped. There are 
traces of blood on his abdomen, 
which acted as an adhesive between 
his skin and his covering. When the 
material was pulled away, a pattern 
was left which we can still see. In- 
cidently, the material was a very 
rare plastic.” 

The three of them looked to me 
for an explanation. 

“When he was stabbed, the knife 
also carried fibers into the wound, 
where they were found during the 
autopsy. He was dressed in cotton.” 

“Cotton? Isn’t that a plant prod- 
uct, one that is used in some kind of 
industry?” O’Moore had recovered 
his stomach and become curious. 



68 



IF 




“Nowadays it is just an ini^ustrial 
raw material. It has a plant origin, 
but it is a plastic. A natural plastic, 
rather than synthetic. This particu- 
lar cotton was doubly unusual. It 
was what was called a ‘stretch fab- 
ric.’ 

“Up to about seventy-five years 
ago, cotton and wool were processed 
mechanically into fabrics which were 
woven as cloth and made into ap- 
parel. Really cheap disposable, plas- 
tic and paper clothes ended that, 
along with laundries.” 

“I see.” 

I continued, “Fibers from his 
clothing adhered to his skin, as well. 
He was washed after his death, to 
loosen his coverings primarily. 
That’s why his chin and hands were 
left bloody. However, microscopic 
traces remained.” 

“So what,” M’Pher blustered. 

“In itself, nothing. There was even 
a cotton warehouse near where he 
was found. But the fibers on the 
corpse did not match any there, so 
he had not been in that building.” 

I paused. It was still not time to 
move quickly. This was not the 
time nor the place for a confronta- 
tion and accusation. My victim 
would not be bullied. “That was 
strange. He had had natural fiber 
clothes. That’s worn only in the as- 
teroids. His lower legs and feet 
showed dust from tanned leather, 
but they don’t wear leather shoes or 
boots even there! 

“His clothes must have been taken 
because they could be identified. 
That raised another area for spec- 
ulation.” 



M’Pher interjected an explosive 
opinion about wild guessing. I let 
him talk, but ignored him otherwise 
as did the three other watchers. No, 
we did not really ignore him . No- 
body had glanced my way in some 
time. 

Recounting the chase, I felt my 
own pulse racing with remembered 
excitement as my trail warmed for 
me, and I felt that three of the four 
others felt the same stimulation. The 
fourth didn’t respond to me at all. 
He just watched M’Pher accusingly, 
as I had set him up to do, without 
moving a muscle. 

“Why was his head shaved? It 
could have been psychological cas- 
tration. Back when we had wars, 
girls who fraternized too much or 
too profitably with invaders were 
sometimes punished after liberation 
by having their heads shaved. They 
were symbolically de-sexed. 

“On the other hand, why bother 
with symbolism? There was no need 
for substitute. He was a total pris- 
oner. He was completely helpless. 

“He was gagged, he could neither 
shout nor scream. 

“He was tied down hand and 
foot, he could neither fight nor run. 

“He was without food or water 
about two days. There was no short- 
age of time or opportunity. 

“Judging by the evidence, he lay 
on his back, his hands and feet 
bound together and lashed down to 
ring bolts. Would that be about 
right, M’Pher?” 

He looked at me, his eyes wide 
and bright. My prey knew whom I 
hunted. “Why ask me? How should 
I know?”

would aid in identification, what 
characteristics could it have that 
would be a revelation?” 

Betty answered, “I don’t see what, 
unless it were green. Or — ” Her eyes 
widened. 

I walked to the upright coffin. 
“See his scalp. Notice the suntan.” 
The mayor and Betty looked; 
M’Pher didn’t leave his chair. 

Betty turned to me and said one 
word: “Bircher.” 

I nodded yes. A bircher. 

VII 

N ot a member of the John Birch 
Society. That had dried up and 
blown away during the Sino-Soviet 
war. But the name lived on, just as 
the Cosa Nostra, the Black Hand 
Society (Mafia) of Sicily had been 




turned from a defense purpose to 
terrorist ends, just as the Ku Klux 
Klan had been subverted by a self- 
interest second generation. 

Birchers and stilyegi. Over a hun- 
dred years ago. The gang war that 
rocked America and shook the 
world, and resulted in the reaction 
that gave us our present stability 
and peace. “Wanna fight? Go to 
the asteroids and take on Mother 
Nature’s homicidal deep space sis- 
ter!” 

The stilyegi. A Russian word, 
given to an American group. The 
descendants of the best generation, 
the great-grandchildren of the zoot- 
suiters; their trademark an unshorn 
head, their emblem a switchblade 
knife. 

They were the owners of the nar- 
cotics trade, and the proprietors of 
almost every house of ill fame in 
the country. Those that they didn’t 
own were small-time hick affairs. 

The birchers. They were the rivals 
of the stilyegi, neither better nor 
worse but the same, hoodlums and 
hooligans. They had to be different, 
so they specialized in hi-jacking and 
armed robbery. They shaved their 
heads except for a single, very nar- 
row stripe of hair than ran straight 
back from the forehead, a fashion 
that was once worn by some native 
Americans, some tribes of warlike 
Indians. 

They claimed to be American In- 
dians. More than that, they shouted 
of their bravery, their virtue, their 
loyalty, how they protected the 
country from alien without and cor- 
rupter within. They lied. They were 
no more protectors of the country 



BIRCHER

than crows were guardians of the 
cornfields. 

Where the stilyegi wore a sloppy 
uniform of jeans and sweatshirt and 
considered it unsmart for either to 
be clean, and carried their sharp 
knives in their pockets, the birohers 
wore leotards, skin tight coverings 
of a single layer of sketch fabric, as 
many square indies as possible trans- 
lucent, and short military jackets. 
They carried their weapons, bayon- 
ets, openly in sheaths at their waists 
and wore heavy field or engineer 
boots. 

All were thugs. If they had elim- 
inated only each other their war 
would have been without signif- 
icance. 

The corpse in the tube had been a 
bircher. His scalp was suntanned ex- 
cept for a band about twenty mili- 
meters wide. He had been knifed, 
so he may have been the victim of 
a stilyegi assassination or the ex- 
ecuted captive from a battle. He 
may have been killed by an initiate 
stilyegi, who thereby got his hands 
so dirty that the clan would never 
fear his going straight. 

“The knife did not kill him.” That 
had been the opinion of the robo- 
surg, with a proviso that he would 
have died from the wound in min- 
utes, had something else not fin- 
ished him. The robosurg didn’t know 
what did kill him. It had not been a 
natural cause of death, the failure 
of one of his vital physiological sys- 
tems. 

I continued, “I imagine that the 
knife was just another torture by his 
captors. He was tied, and the blade 
may have been pushed into his belly 



and left for him to cut his way free. 
If he could figure out how. He 
couldn’t.” 

B etty, O’Moore and the boy wait- 
ed for me to continue. M’Pher’s 
eyes opened at my guess. It was a 
pity, in a way; he had been telling 
the world so long that I was a help- 
less, bumbling booby, that he had 
come to believe it himself. Oh, that 
my enemy would always so under- 
estimate me! 

“What killed him, then?” Betty 
was curious. Even the corpse seemed 
to be listening to my words. 

“Same thing that preserved him, 
of course.” I wanted to be opaque 
for a few more minutes. 

M’Pher’s expression didn’t change. 
The other two brightened. 

“He had a girl friend. More than 
that, she was pregnant by him. He 
didn’t tell her where he was off to, 
only that he had an idea how they 
could make a real killing.” I smiled. 
“A killing was made, but not what 
he anticipated. He never came back, 
and of course they were never mar- 
ried. 

“She carried his child, and kept 
faith in him. Judging by the records 
again, she was the only one who did. 
Nevertheless, she refused to give 
the child up for adoption. The son 
grew to maturity, and when in due 
course of events she passed away, 
the only legacy their child inherited 
was having his name listed as next 
of kin for a long-vanished bircher. 

“Their granddaughter inherited no 
more, nor did I, their great-grand- 
child.” I looked deep into M’Pher’s 
eyes. “I wasn’t surprised to receive 



72 



IF 




a card from the bureau, asking if I 
would care to make an identifica- 
tion, but it did start me thinking.” 
I poured myself a drink, and stood 
beside my ancestor. “It always both- 
ered me, that I recognized him when 
I looked at him, but I never knew 
who he was. I got to wondering 
how would he look say thirty years 
older than he was. I was thinking 
that way when I looked into a mir- 
ror.” 

“He is — ^was — skinny and eight- 
een. I am fat and forty-seven. I 
felt their eyes going back and forth 
between us, adding up the similar- 
ities in color, in facial features, in 
general build. 

“I don’t know if he got into this 
on his own, or if he walked into a 
trap. The stilyegi were supposed to 
have a blood initiation sometimes, 
and this might have been a handy 
way to get the blood.” I shrugged. 
“Maybe my ancestor found a key 
that would get him into a space 
module and got caught prowling. 

“You know what happened. We 
don’t use that kind of ship any more 
at all. They weren’t used very long, 
but they were handy. The cheapest 
kind of space travel ever developed.” 
They had seen the pictures; the ships 
were only long tubes, some three 
meters in diameter, with wide noses 
and wide sterns. The robot controls 
were in the fore cone, the drive ma- 
chinery in the tube and the tail only 
supported the craft on the apron. 
Cargo came in individual containers 
each shaped like a wedge of cake. 
A wedge with a bite taken from the 
point, to conform to the core tube. 

They were wonderful economi- 



cally. The trouble was, when they 
fired up, the engines irradiated the 
modules and junked too much car- 
go. Just as the laboratory irradi- 
ating equipment preserved a stiff' in 
a tube. The ships also had a ten- 
dency, once in a while, to fry per- 
sonnel. Even personnel in protected 
bunkers quite a way away, although 
that was rare. 

C4T)ut — you mean he’s been in 
space all this time?” Betty 

asked. 

“That’s right. Protected against 
dehydration by a blanket of frozen 
air. 

“The stilyegi had some red-hot 
contraband, including some weapons 
that may have been connected with 
crimes, and some loot that had so 
many people looking for it that it 
wasn’t safe to dispose of. 

“They got to somebody in con- 
trols and fouled up a robot so that 
instead of heading for Mars, it 
looped out in a long orbit past Jup- 
iter. I know who, but he’s dead. 

“Either the boy here was just 
looking for loot, or he somehow got 
the idea that there was something 
going on. Maybe they set a trap for 
him, to bloody the hands of a couple 
of their apprentices. Anyhow, the 
stilyegi got him. Probably violently. 
The robosurg reports that he got a 
concussion somehow in the back of 
his skull that must have resulted in 
temporary unconsciousness. 

“They had access to a cargo mod- 
ulus, where they had stashed their 
stuff. They couldn’t let 'him go, be- 
cause he was a birchen He’d either 
try to arrange a hi-jack, or even go 



BIRCHER 



F3 




to the police. Either way the stilyegi 
were out. Some of them could wind 
up getting hanged. 

“Somebody had an idea, so they 
tied him down in the pod and put 
the knife into him. Before or in be- 
tween, they worked him over. Then 
they left him there. He was awake 
when he died. He was probably 
awake while he was being beaten, 
too, but that’s neither here nor there. 
Incidentally, he died one hundred 
and eighteen years ago.” 

VIII 

B etty’s eyes expressed a blank, 
and his honor was trying to 
think of a way to word the question 
he felt. 

I had to finish explaining. “There 
was no need for the crime to be dis- 
covered. Well, yes, there was. But it 
was a psychological need rather 
than physical necessity. If a person 
dies now, it’s practically impossible 
to conceal the fact — ^because of 
credit cards. 

“If a person goes too long without 
any charges, we take a look-see. 
Also, every six months, everybody 
has to turn his card in and get a 
new one. When he does that, his 
fingerprints are recorded. 

“Besides, there’s no way for the 
average person to dispose of a body. 
Dead human beings don’t keep very 
wejl. After a while they start to 
smell. Apartments haven’t had food 
preparation centers now for almost 
a century, and people simply don’t 
have the large deepfreezes that were 
once common, where flesh could be 
stored indefinitely. 



“A person can’t even chop a 
corpse up and flush it down the 
water closet. The sewage outflow is 
monitored for just such contingen- 
cies. 

“This corpse didn’t present that 
problem. It was in a state of preser- 
vation, lying in a shipment module 
at about absolute zero in a space- 
ship theoretically lost in space. 
Somebody couldn’t let things go on 
that way. 

“I suppose I’m naive, but I had 
thought that the stilyegi were gone. 
That they vanished at about the 
same time as the birchers. That 
wasn’t the truth, however. This body 
was brought home to haunt me by 
a living stilyegi. A hundred years 
ago, the birchers got the upper hand. 
They were in the majority, to begin 
with, and they had an advantage, 
more sympathy from the public and 
the police. 

“When the handwriting was post- 
ed on the wall, a group of the stil- 
yegi took action. They acted smart. 
They got haircuts, and they bought 
better fitting suits. I suppose some 
of them joined the birchers, even. 
Without its brain trust, the stilyegi 
— that is, the visible stilyegi — ran 
out of steam and folded. 

“With the stilyegi gone, the birch- 
ers found themselves up against it. 
Perhaps they were not as clever. 
Maybe the top ranks were absorbed 
into the underground that the others 
left. Anyway, the birchers had no- 
body to protect America against — 
and they had the entire population, 
and now the police too, down on 
them. 

“They had, before, had some sym- 



74 



IF 




pathy from the citizenry and the 
police, but that was really all revul- 
sion against the stilyegi. With them 
only a memory, the birchers couldn’t 
stand up too long against a united 
population. 

“The stilyegi weren’t gone. They 
were underground. In a disguise of 
respectability, they passed on their 
gains from one generation to an- 
other, and added to them with 
stealth and cunning — ^but with no 
more respect for others than they 
had ever had. 

“They bought themselves posi- 
tions of respect and honor. Public 
jobs, where they were the trusted. 
One of them almost made the grand 
coup, the one job in this sector that 
would have given them a literal 
license to kill, but the machine 
wouldn’t hear of it and put its own 
man in the post.” I stared at 
M’Pher, letting him know that each 
additional word that I spoke, now, 
would be a stone added to the an- 
chor I was tying to his feet. 

There was just one difficulty! He 
was immune to me. He had never 
killed. 

T he mayor spoke again. “But 
there are still stilyegi?” He was 
shocked just as I had been. 

“That’s how the freighter got re- 
trieved. The boss of the original job 
had a record of what he had done. 
The ship was in a long orbit, it 
would not be back conveniently close 
to Earth for more than a century, 
but that was all right. It would give 
the weapons and the loot a chance to 
cool off. 

“He passed the information on 



to his son, eventually his grandson 
and finally his great grandson got 
the word. He had access to a ship, 
and had a hand-picked crew of 
three. They intercepted the freighter 
and remote-guided it down to an 
undeveloped area on the far side 
of the moon. ^ 

“Not the moon of Earth, Phobos 
of Mars. They triggered the warm- 
ing equipment, so they wouldn’t 
have to thaw out the cargo, and af- 
ter a couple of hours entered. I pre- 
sume they were surprised to find the 
body. I don’t know what thoughts 
ran through the mind of the leader 
of the salvage group. Maybe he 
subconsciously detected the resem- 
blance between my ancestor and me. 

“The opportunity was too good to 
miss. It was a golden chance to dis- 
credit me, because obviously I would 
never be able to identify the corpse. 
Neither could I find the killer. He 
was dead himself! The body was 
thawed with the rest of the capsule, 
so they wrapped it in a tarp, fused 
the edges to keep out microorgan- 
isms and moved the body into their 
own ship. 

“Then they dumped the body, 
warmed up their scriptwriters, and 
waited for things to run their 
course.” 

They were staring at me, now, 
quietly. Except for one; his eyes 
neyer left M’Pher. 

“Oh, yes, I have excellent relations 
with the asteroid people. The conies. 
Their homicide inspector is a rel- 
ative of mine. And of his.” I nodded 
at the corpse. “He doesn’t have as 
many murders as I do, so he has 
plenty of time to meddle in other 



BIRCHER 



75 




things. Just as, here, I am guilty of 
trespass. 

“He found the ship. One pod had 
been opened, and in it, along with 
the remainder of the loot, he found 
a bloody floor, a stilyegi knife and 
the clothing that had been removed 
from the corpse. He found a cargo 
manifest under a crate. It was signed 
by a ‘MacPherson.’ Your ancestor?” 

M’Pher stared at me. It was a 
captive stare, and I didn’t like it. 
I like the chase, not the capture. 
Wasn’t he going to fight me? No 
wonder the machine hadn’t changed 
my plans. 

“You gave yourself away,” I told 
him. “You attacked me in your 
paper with altogether too much vir- 
ulence. You’ve never made any sec- 
ret of hating me, I was the one who 
stood between you and the power 
you’ve coveted. You must hate me 
even moxe than I do.” 

When he made it clear that he 
would not reply, I drove another 
nail. “As soon as it dawned on me 
that this wasn’t a recent crime, I 
started to wonder who was profit- 
ing. By the third editorial, I was so 
curious about you that I checked the 
trip recorder of your private car, 
your new limousine. I was quite 
surprised to find you, of all people, 
visiting the amusement park the 
night before our friend was found. 
And that was the only recorded trip 
where you ordered your machine 
to fly low and slow. 

“There was another thing, too. I 
suppw3se you washed the boy in part 
to prevent his dirtying the car. Fine, 
but you didn’t waki the car. 

“Along with your other antique 



pursuits, you smoke those vile cigars. 
You light them with paper matches.” 
I held up the tiny piece of card- 
board I found in the alley. “When 
you pushed him out the door, his 
hand scraped this up from the floor 
or seat.” 

His lips moved, he swallowed. 
My heart beat wildly. Perhaps the 
machine was wrong. 

He snatched the ancient pistol, 
pulled back the hammer, pointed it 
and fired. But not at me! 

He aimed at the boy his great- 
grandfather had helped kill. 

T he gun exploded, chopping off 
his hand, as I had made sure it 
would do. The shattered tube of 
steel that had been the barrel threw 
itself across the room like an orchid 
made of metal and smashed the 
glass tube into splinters, throwing 
the corpse out onto my carpet. 

I put a tourniquet around the 
pulped stump of M’Pher’s arm, and 
Betty sent for a medic, but there 
wasn’t enough time. M’Pher lived 
only a couple of minutes. He wanted 
to die. I wasn’t sure why, but I felt 
that he would rather not live than 
go on knowing he had been beaten 
by someone for whom he had ex- 
pressed such profound contempt. 

I had wanted to die. I had tried, 
again, to be killed, but the machine 
had beaten me one more time. Beat- 
en me, but not all the way. The vic- 
tory was not unmixed. I felt some- 
thing of myself expire, become no 
more a part of me, deep inside. 

How ironic! I had wanted to kill 
myself, and all I succeeded in de- 
stroying was my will to die! END

THE MAN 
FROM WHEN 

by DANNIE PLACHTA 



He came out of nowhere — 
and could never go back! 



M r. Smith was about to mix a 
moderately rationed Martini 
for himself, when a thunderous ex- 
plosion quaked through his house, 
upsetting the open bottle of Ver- 
mouth. After applying a steadying 
hand to the gin bottle, and while the 
ice cubes still tinkled maniacally 
in their shuddering bowl, he sprint- 
ed outside. An incandescent glare a 
hundred yards from the house de- 
stroyed the purple sunset he had 
been admiring not five minutes ear- 
lier. “Oh, my God!” he said, and 
ran back in to phone the state 
police. 

As Smith was procuring a heady 
draught of gin directly from the 
bottle, he was further alarmed by 



a steadily gushing hiss from beyond 
his open front door. When the sound 
persisted for a full minute, he went 
cautiously to the porch to find an 
intense mist rising from the area of 
the fiery thing he had viewed mo- 
ments earlier. Somewhat awed, and 
thoroughly scared, he watched and 
waited for about five minutes. Just 
as he was about to go inside for 
another belt of gin, a man walked 
out of the fog and said, “Good eve- 
ning.” 

“Good evening,” said Mr. Smith. 
“Are you the police?” 

“Oh, no,” answered the stranger. 
“I’m from that,” he said, pointing a 
finger into the mist. “My cooling 
equipment finally kicked into high.” 



77 




“You’re a spaceman,” Smith de- 
cided. 

“I only came a few hundred 
miles,” shrugged the stranger mod- 
estly. “Mostly, I’m a time traveller.” 
He paused to light a dark cheroot. 
“The one and only time traveler,” 
he added, with a touch of pride in 
his voice. 

“The real McCoy, eh? Well, come 
on in and have a drink. Vermouth’s 
all gone, but I saved the gin.” 

“Be glad to,” said the stranger, 
as they walked in together. 

“Past or future?” wondered 
Smith, handing the bottle to his 
guest. 

“From the future,” replied the 
time traveler after a satisfying 
pause. “Hits the spot,” he smiled, re- 
turning the bottle. 

‘Well,” said Smith, sitting down 
and making himself comfortable, “I 
guess you’ll want to tell me all about 
it.” 

“Yes, thank you, I would.” 

“Feel free,” said Smith, passing 
the bottle. 

“Well, I had my final calcula- 
tions, with the usual plus or minus 
. .. .” He paused for another sip 
of gin. “And of course it was the 
minus that had me a little worried.” 



“But you took the chance,” inter-^ 
jected Smith. 

“Naturally. And as it happened, 
there was some minus. Just enough 
to destroy the world.” 

‘That is too bad,” Smith com- 
mented, reaching for the bottle. 

“Yes. You see, there was such an 
expenditure of energy that it com- 
pletely wiped out the Earth of my 
time. The force blasted me all the 
way through space to this spot. By 
the way, I am sorry if I disturbed 
you.” 

“It was nothing, nothing at all. 
Forget it.” 

‘Well, in any event, I took the 
chance and I’m not sorry. A cal- 
culated risk, but I proved my point. 
In spite of everything, I still think 
it was worth it. What do you think?” 

“Well, as you said, you took the 
chance; you proved your point. I 
suppose it was worth it.” Smith took 
a final drink, saving a few glimmer- 
ing drops for his guest. “By the way, 
how far from the future did you 
travel?” 

The time traveller grabbed the gin 
bottle and consulted his watch. 
“Eighteen minutes,” he replied. 

“It wasn’t worth it,” said Smith.

CYBERNIA

Illustrated by LUTJENS 



She was an Old Martian, anyone 
could see that But there had 
never been any Old Martians! 



I 

✓ 

I was in Mexico City in Novem- 
ber, ^ taping the bull fights for 
next summer’s microwaves, when 
Gallegher stumbled on me. If you 
like black beer, Restaurant Prendes 
is the place for you; so I was there. 

Prendes flourished while Porfirio 
Diaz was dictator. It has survived 
the earthquake which attended Ma- 
dero’s triumphal entry, the civil con- 
vulsions of the revolution, the 
stormy session of the United Nations 



and fifty years of U. S. tourists. 
Prendes’s tap beer was the best in 
the world when Diaz ruled. It still 
is. 

I was on the second stein when 
Galeg backed around the glass 
screen that masks the entrance. I 
would have known that rusty neck 
in hell; and I rose and collared it. 
**Tiene usted” I asked, *'un fosforo, 
Senor?** 

Without a word, he extended a 
five hundred peso note backward 
at me. 



79 





“Many thanks. This’ll keep that 
tap pouring for a week.” 

He retrieved the bank note just 
as I was sitting down, and flagged 
a mozo with it. “Two more of 
these,” he ordered, pointing at my 
beer, “and a plate of huachinango 
Veracruzana for me. Are you eat- 
ing?” 

I had, so I sat watching while he 
put away the fish and slanted a bold 
eye at me between gulps of the 
Modelo. As he was finishing, I lit 
a cigar and dug the needle into 
him. “So you’re on the dodge again? 
If you’d like me to put in a good 
word with the police . .” 

“Never fear. It’s not the police 
that’s worrying me. It’s a female.” 
“Relax,” I told him. “What wom- 
an would pursue a great gowk of a 
fellow with a permanent Mars-burn? 

She probably mistook you for an 
uncle, and a few words will clear 
up the whole — ” 

“A few words! That one expects 
me to tell her all the secrets of 
heaven and hell and join her in a 
new wave of evolution. It’s all Cy- 
bernia’s fault. Cybernia, where are 
you?” 

“Who is Cybernia, what is she, 
that all the swains her praises sing?” 
The Old Galeg looked at me sus- 
piciously. “There was a Swayne in 
it, all right. You’ve heard already, 
have you?”^ 

“Only what everybody’s heard: 
how you shot your way out of the 
boudoir, the doxie on your arm — ” 
“Phoo!” Now his self-confidence 
was restored. He no longer kept a 
corner-eyed watch toward the door. 
“Look here. I’ve* nothing to do for 



the afternoon. Switch off that methy- 
lated pickup to your tape, and I’ll 
give you the true orbit about Cyber- 
nia and Dona Luisa out there.” 

I signaled el mozo to keep the 
lubricant flowing free, and Galleg- 
her began reflectively: 

F ortune telling, fake or for real, 
always fascinated me. I was 
born under a caul, my mother told 
me, and it may be I have a little of 
the power myself. I’m not telling. 

Last spring I had ah argument 
with the big jet at Dome One on 
Mars. There was some fool talk 
about a few liters of high Geiger 
concentrate missing out of my last 
few loads, and it ended with me 
walking out on him just before his 
fuel tank exploded. I knew he was 
due to be rotated to earth and I 
forgave him his nerves, for I’m the 
forgiving sort. I wouldn’t like to 
spend three straight years on Mars 
myself. 

There I was, then, with no job 
and about a thousand sparks in my 
pocket — and on Mars. The twenty- 
five thou that passage to Earth cost 
might as well have been a million. 
So I went to the carnival. 

It was just as wild as it always 
is. I mean. Mars ain’t the same 
moral climate as here ... if you 
understand me. But it wasn’t kicks 
from the “dancing” girls I was 
looking for. It was a stake. I wan- 
dered along past the Sacred Mar- 
riage Rites of the Bird People from 
Arcturus and the Awful Ootopi 
from Alpha Centauri. Who knows 
better than a jet jockey that we 
haven’t even got to Pluto? Arcturus!

IF 




Well, it was a partner I was hunt- 
ing, you understand. I can get all the 
lone wolfing I want in space, with 
just me and the flame and the cargo, 
hoping the techs taped a true course 
for me and the pipe. When I’m on 
dirt, I like someb^y back to back 
with me. What I was really looking 
for was a three card monte layout. 
I figured to beat it for a thousand 
or so just to show I knew where 
the pips on the cards were, and dien 
join up with the operators on a little 
faster operation. 

There was a big crowd milling 
around to get in and see the Mat- 
ing Dance of the Amazons — in four 
dimensions — and as the last strag- 
glers rushed the ticket taker, I saw 
what I wanted: a little monte store. 
I wandered over like a yokel and 
asked if they could tell me when 
the Amazons would mate again. 
They could, and they did, and it 
was just time enough to run the 
cards a few times. 

Well, I picked the Queen a 
couple of times, and missed her 
a couple of times, and a little 
crowd gathered, the way they will, 
and pretty soon the roper got me 
off to one side and began to ex- 
plain to me how he was going to 
mark the Queen. (You know the 
gaff, don’t you? On the last big 
bet, the marked card turns out — 
surprise! — ^not to be the Queen. 
The only way out is to mark the 
Queen yourself for the last bet; 
but you’ve got to be as quick as 
the man who kissed the ostrich, or 
none of ’em will be the Queen.) 

I meant to listen. But right in 
the middle something began to 



tickle my neck — and it wasn’t the 
roper’s breath, though he had one 
that would fuel a rocket. I had to 
look around. Sure enough, when I 
did I saw this ratty little tent down 
a kind of cul-de-sac off the mid- 
way. 

There wasn’t much bally to it: 
just a canvas sign, “MARTINA”, 
and underneath, in smaller letters, 
“Past. Present. Future. What may 
be, can be.” 

I was hooked. I was ahead may- 
be twenty credits on the Monte 
game, and I shook the roper off 
and headed straight for the fortune 
teller. The tent was bigger than 
it looked, somehow, when you got 
up close, and an ugly character in 
a beard and a stench was guarding 
the door. 

“How much?” I asked him. 

He got a kind of sly look on 
his face and told me it wasn’t a 
commercial enterprise; that a con- 
tribution was expected in accord- 
ance with the help one got; that 
the “personage” inside — he hesitated 
over that — was a Martian, endowed 
with senses unknown to man. 

Now, I know as well as you do 
there wasn’t no Martians when de 
Camp first got there except the 
lichens and the two-inch oaks. But 
this guy’s manner had my jets rum- 
bling. He somehow acted as if he 
didn’t want me to come in. I was 
hot to get by him. 

Finally, he sighed in his beard 
and played his trump card, “You’ll 
have to take off your shoes.” 

\ nybody who runs the risk of be- 
ing caught without shoes on 



CYBERKIA

Mai’s is an idiot. The sand of Mars 
is one big sponge; and in a hun- 
dred steps, it’ll suck out all the 
water in your body. There’s a mum- 
my in the Mars museum who was 
the first rocket kicker who found 
out what the sand is. 

So I kept my shoes in my hand. 
I didn’t even take them off until I 
was on the flooring of the tent. 
Beard boy tried to grab them, but 
I ignored him. Right inside the tent, 
of all things, was a door. Everything 
else on Mars is sphincters or pres- 
sure valves. Tlie handle of the door 
was hard as hagan to turn, and it 
pinched my finger when I did move 
it. 

Behind that door was a three-D 
projection of the solar system as the 
sweetest, the smartest and the most 
innocent baby alive might imagine 
it. The sun didn’t burn, it just 
flashed gold. All the planets looked 
like Earth, green and gorgeous. The 
firmament, instead of the fire and 
ice that it actually is, was got up 
in the color of a summer sky — 
that fresh-washed blue, you know — 
and a few cottony clouds drifting 
through it. 

It took my breath away. A chair 
walked up behind me, and I sat 
down in it to watch and worship 
that gay sun apd his friendly planets. 
The place was pressurized too. It 
smelled like a spring morning on 
earth, and there was a kind of 
faint, far away birdsong. 

This went on for all of a min- 
ute with me drinking in that beauty, 
and then it was gone. That beauti- 
ful projection shrank to the size of 
a reactor pellet surrounded by a 



dead black void, and then it ex- 
ploded! 

A real nova couldn’t have been 
brighter. I felt as i if my eyes had 
been put out. I knew they were 
closed, but they couldn’t shut out 
that light. I don’t know how long I 
was blind, sitting there holding my 
shoes in my lap and waiting for 
God-knows-what; but after a while 
I could sense a pulse in the light, 
and between pulses I could see pat- 
terns: wild colors, startling figures, 
and bright spirals like polished plat- 
inum coils. Then the light began to 
separate into flashes, and between 
flashes I could glimpse the real in- 
side of the room I was in. 

It was a little dome. All around 
were lighted disks in different col- 
ors, forty or fifty, and different 
sizes, all blinking at different rates. 
To one side, where I could barely 
see it, was a bank of lights — ^twenty- 
four, I made it — ^flashing a dozen 
times a minute in a different pattern 
every time. 

Except for the. colored blinkers 
and the bank of lights, there wasn’t 
any other illumination. The flashes 
were too bright to see by, and they 
made me blink, too, so I couldn’t see 
anything except the patterns of veins 
in my eyelids ... so it was some 
time before I caught what was right 
in front of me, about ten feet away. 

It was the Martian. 

You never saw a creature like 
that. 

Nobody else did, either. Not out- 
side that tent. 

It had eight legs, jointed and stiff 
like a spider. The head was a great, 
gleaming, silvery sphere, with two 



CYBERNIA 



83 




dark blue-green spots that weren’t 
eyes. Itiey slid and slipped around 
the surface, changing size and their 
relation to each other every instant. 

In between that spherical head 
and those spidery legs, it was a 
woman. From neck to navel, she 
was as naked as a star, and a million 
times as beautiful. 

II 

Y ou can get the picture, can’t 
you? Me in that dark room, 
surrounded by flashes and pulses of 
light and color, facing that Martian 
sphinx. I was as unoriented as the 
primal atom. If there were flies on 
Mars, I could have caught a colony, 
my jaw was that slack. The hackles 
of my neck stood up like a dog’s, 
and I just stared. 

The flashes had stopped but the 
blinking was still going on, and off 
to the side that bank of lights was 
still running off patterns, when the 
Martian spoke. It wasn’t the voice 
that woke me — though it was a mus- 
ical sound, kind of barrel-organ 
music, none of your chamber stuff; 
a real lilt in it — no, what woke me 
was the movement that accompan- 
ied the voice. It was a delicious kind 
of ripple in that lovely flesh, and 
seeing it brought me to full con- 
sciousness at once. The patterns in 
the bank at the side began to run 
and crackle almost faster than I 
could notice, and all the colored 
disks began to blink more rapidly. 
The silver globe was spinning with 
the two dark spots sliding around. 

“What would you know?” was the 
first thing the Martian said. 



I got hold of myself. “Who am 
I?” 

And the Martian told me. Called 
me by the name my mother did, 
which you shan’t hear. Gave me my 
blood type, star number, weight, 
height, home town, the amount of 
money in my wallet and the hour 
and minute I had walked off the 
job. “What would you know?” 

I asked, “Who are you?” 

“A child of the stars. Ask not 
of my Star, or I reply no more. 
What would you know?’^ 

I gave up on that. Those ripples 
were making me sweat, so •! rushed 
it up. “What am I going to do in 
the next week?” 

“You will succeed in a great un- 
dertaking, but you will humble 
yourself to do so. Above all, remem- 
ber this: from this moment, you 
can . succeed . only . with 
. the help . of . MARS!” 
I asked what that meant, but all 
the lights went off. There was a faint 
luminescence from the silver globe, 
spinning, spinning, and all was dark- 
ness. The voice sank in the distance. 
“Return tomorrow. Tomorrow . 
tomorrow . return . .” 

The chair turned me around and 
helped me to my feet. The door 
opened, and there I was with my 
shoes in my hand and Black Beard 
in my nostrils. He looked at me 
with accusation and said, “The con- 
tribution bowl is at your left.” 

It took some rooting around, but 
I managed to find a one-credit note 
in my roll. He looked at it contemp- 
tuously and blocked my way. That 
was all I needed. 

I hit him right in the center of 



84 



IF 




the stubble, with all the frustration 
and fear that thing inside had left 
in me. I might as well have hit an 
old-fashioned jaok-o-lantern. His 
face just kind of squished, and the 
next thing I knew, he was rolling on 
the sand and the face was slipping 
off. I grabbed the hair and had the 
whole thing in my hand. 

It was a mask of plastic flesh. The 
head underneath it was as feature- 
less as an egg. The only breaks in 
the smoothness were a spreading 
ugly bruise where I’d caught him, 
and two slits where hrs eyes were 
closed. 

About that time, something 
caught me. Have you ever been 
kicked in the back by a woman who 
really meant it? 

W hen I picked myself up, she 
had a little, old-fashioned 
solid projectile gun aimed at me, 
and old egghead was sitting up, 
shaking his head hard enough to 
addle it. She handed him the mask. 

“Put it back on, Swayne. Then 
run through this fellow’s pockets. 
He’s got better than a thousand 
sparks in a pigskin wallet,” 

“Go ahead, honey,” I told her. 
“Tell me my weight and my blood 
type again.” Of course, you can’t see 
what a woman 'looks like when she’s 
dressed for out of doors on Mars, 
and her voice didn’t sound the same 
as it did through the machine, but 
it stood to reason. She had to come 
out of the tent to get me the way 
she did, and she knew to the spark 
how many credits I had in my tank. 

“Just tell me one thing,” I said, 
as I stood and gracefully revolved 



to -bring my wallet pocket into 
Swayne’s reach. “Say that wasn’t a 
mask on you.” 

She laughed. I never thought 
much of freckles before, but some- 
how the sprinkle of them across 
her nose put a whole new content 
into the concept of freckles. 
“Rocket, you’re okay,” she told me 
then. “No hard feelings, I know. 
You can’t spark out. Nobody gets 
paid better than you lightning jok- 
eys. If you’re broke, all you have 
to do is grab a hot pipe back to 
Earth. I told you to humble your- 
self.” 

I turned the other pocket. “Egg,” 
I told the barker, “there’s a few 
credits in a money clip you missed.” 

She cocked the little old pistol. 
“Nobody makes any funny remarks 
about Swayne. He got burned in 
the high Geiger mines, and he's 
getting a new face grown on him. 
You think that’s funny?” 

Maybe you think freckles can’t 
reflect emotion. You’re wrong. I 
was looking at the little constella- 
tion of them on her nasal bridge, 
and each one looked like another 
model of that popgun she was hold- 
ing. 

“Mrs. Swayne, I apologize. And 
Mr. Swayne, if you’ll lend me a 
hundred of my own credits. I’ll buy 
you a drink. I’m down and out my- 
self, but you’ve made me feel like 
an oxygen thief and the luckiest 
man alive all at the same time. I 
heard about guys getting caught in 
flash fissions before, but you’re the 
first I ever saw. I apologize again,” 

You can’t tap a foot in the Mar- 
tian sand very well; but she was 



CYBERNIA 



85 




switching the muzzle of that little 
old pistol in the air with the same 
rhythm. “You say you’re down and 
out, but you’re not. All you have 
to do is go apologize to the Super 
at Dome One, and you’ll be riding 
a flame to Earth’s space station to- 
night.” 

I explained to her why I didn’t 
think that was possible, and why 
I couldn’t apologize to the Super 
with the same sincerity I had to 
them. Then I couldn’t resist digging 
her. “How come you can’t read me 
out here? Inside that fake tent, you 
knew every bump in my brain.” 
She grinned. “That’s just it. Out 
here I haven’t got my electronic 
fingers on your skull. Give him two 
hundred, Brud, and let’s get that 
drink. I’d give it all back. Rocket, 
but we need it for the hospital.” 

“Is it Mr. and Mrs. Brad 
Swayne?” I asked. “Or what?” 
“Brud,” she said, “Brud, Brud! 
Bruddie! Swayne’s my brother, not 
my husband. Still game for that 
drink?” 

“Lady,” I replied, “did anybody 
ever tell you you have cute freck- 
les?” 

After we had absorbed a few 
high-volatile cups, we all switched in 
our reserve air tanks, you might say. 
I was pleased that she hadn’t order- 
ed any of that sweet Venusian bub- 
ble-juice; and a few jolts of sour 
mash^ Carbon- 14 always loosens 
everybody up. 

They were in tough shape, for 
sure. Pushing the hot pipes is tough, 
but picking the high G ore out of 
Mars’s old rocks is the toughest 



racket in the cosmos. She had 
thrown up a good job in the Lon- 
don School of Electroencephalo- 
graphy to get right out to him when 
it came through that he was burned. 
If she hadn’t, he never would have 
survived. Just knowing she was on 
the way gave him something to hang 
on to during the first months after 
his burn. 

After she kept him alive, they 
were stuck. Broke, and with an ex- 
pensive course of bio-plastics on the 
books to get him a new face. No 
compensation, either. Those ore 
pickers are all independent contrac- 
tors. The first goixl break came 
when an experimental type of rocket 
blew up almost on top of their living 
dome, so they were able to beat the 
caterpillar salvage guys to the loot. 
Instead of selling it, she had built 
the first installation of that tent. 
The bank of lights was an auto- 
matic analyzer, and the stiff handle 
took a blood sample when it pinch- 
ed you. The shoes had to come off 
to ground you into the feeler cir- 
cuits built into the floor. 

She was way over my head talk- 
ing about the still unsolved mystery 
of thought itself; but I got that she 
could reach random information and 
surface thought in a brain and get 
enough character to go on from 
there with a regular old-time for- 
tune teller’s act. 

The “come back” routine was de- 
signed to increase the take. If a 
customer came back, he was hook- 
ed, and the second look at his brain 
surface gave her a real handle 
on him. 

Still, they weren’t making money. 



86 



IF 




because Swayne’s treatments cost a 
lot, and living’s not cheap on Mars, 
even in the slums. They might never 
get off the rusty planet, and we all 
got a little bitter and cynical about 
it. 

Until the brainstorm hit me. 

I laid it out on the table, and we 
kicked it around a little. Finally she 
ordered a round of straight caffeine 
and we examined it again, on the 
alert. It still looked good. 

Ill 

M y idea was, if she was going to 
fake, why not fake something 
worthwhile? The techno psychs are 
all over the place, but everybody 
knows (it’s never admitted in your 
tapes, but it’s true) that there are 
plenty of minds slightly off orbit. 
What the techno psychs do, you 
know, is to throw the whole system 
out of balance to compensate the 
aberration of the moment. Then a 
few months later, they give it an- 
other twist. Your circuits always feel 
smooth, but they’re always a little 
out of phase. 

It’s been a long time since any- 
body tried to straighten up a whole 
system. We’ve got used to every- 
body’s being a little off target, and 
we get along with it, without liking 
it. My idea was to rebuild her de- 
vice into a machine for general 
psychic adjustment. That way we 
could get it off the midway and 
turn it into a real racket. Anybody 
who can promise to make fortunes 
instead of just to tell fortunes is go- 
ing to be swimming in credits . 
’til they catch up with him. 



The trouble was that she had 
ethics. 

Everyone from the Londcm 
School has, she told me; basic con- 
ditioning in the first year. But she 
looked as if she’d like to cry when 
she told me, and I finally dug it 
out of her that she’d evaded her con- 
ditioning to break away and cpme 
up to Mars when Swayne got burn- 
ed, and the conflict she’d generated 
was still bubbling in her. 

Well, I talked to her, but what’s 
talk? She saw through my every 
gambit, and for a couple of hours, 
it kept looking like a worse and 
worse idea. I told her the truth; fuel 
your own tank first is still the basic 
human ethic, never mind what it’s 
going to be someday; and she said 
I hadn’t any ethical standard at all, 
and didn’t understand even what the 
words meant. 

All of a sudden, we both realized 
her brother hadn’t kept on with the 
conversation. When we looked at 
him, his face — the one on the 
mask — was all out of shape. I 
didn’t realize what was happening, 
but she did. He was crying inside his 
mask, and it had slipped. 

That turned the trick. There was 
a lot of blubbery confirmation, but 
as soon as she looked at me over 
his shoulder, I knew the same deep- 
er compulsion that broke her con- 
ditioning before had broken it again. 

The essence of a good swindle is 
planning. Performance is just the 
icing on the cake. It helps to have 
a trained crew, but her formal train- 
ing and mechanical knowledge were 
enough, with the experience she’d 
had in her tent. 



CYBERNIA

We cooked it up pretty good the 
next day. The first thing we had to 
do was to get some big shot into 
the tent. We couldn’t afford the 
rental on the main strip of the carni- 
val, and it was a thousand chances 
to one that we’d ever get one of 
the big *uns to turn that shabby little 
comer, as I had. 

We finally worked it out neatly. 
I was to snatch one. 

I t isn’t as risky as it sounds. On 
Mars, the conditions of society 
are such that everybody is accessi- 
ble. It’s just too tough to be other- 
wise; and besides, no one can forget 
Rooky Hdloran’s dying in Dome 
One thirty seconds after he reeled 
off the coordinates of the first big 
high G strike. Nobody wants to 
miss it if some other rock-knocker 
wanders in with another hot location 
on the tip of a tongue about to wag 
its last. 

I wore a disguise; Swayne’s face. 
With my features inside to distort 
it, it didn’t look like Swayne. And 
it sure didn’t look like me. 

About seven o’clock, just before 
quitting time, I skimmed into Dome 
One and around to the big jet’s 
office. It was all thinned out of 
people, and he was just fitting on 
his air when I slid in and showed 
him two things: Cybernia’s antique 
popgun and a note to precede me 
quietly. 

I tried to smile to calm him, but 
it mu^ have made that face look 
worse. He turned as white as you, 
but he managed to walk. 

After hours, nobody cares a hot 
hagan for protocol on Mars, so no- 



body paid any attention as we 
strolled out of Dome One. We 
headed off toward the carnival, and 
he began to argue, quiet like. I had 
my hand inside his arm, as if we 
were old buddies, and I let him 
feel that little old hand* cannon like 
a finger in his ribs. After that, he 
didn’t make a sound. 

He did cuss once when the door 
handle took its blood sample. We 
had figured he would balk at taking 
off his shoes, so we just sat him 
in the chair, and Cyberrtia hypno- 
tized him. She hypnotized me too, 
even though I knew the gaff. It was 
comical, the way her shape sagged 
and lost its appeal, when I thought 
about it later on. She said she didn’t 
want to have to keep damping down 
my impulses, so she just hypnotized 
us both. 

Then her ethics got her by the 
throat again. She left poor old rota- 
tion bait sitting in the chair, blind 
and deaf to everything real, and got 
up and came over to me,^ I objected 
when she started pulling on a jersey, 
but she said, “Don’t worry. He still 
thinks I’m there. What do you think 
he’s staring at? But Galeg, we can’t 
do it. If you could understand what 
the analyzer is showing on the inside 
of that silver dome, you’d realize. 
He’s so far gone I’m afraid to touch 
anything.” 

Well, she cried and she cried, 
but she wouldn’t do it. She sobbed 
that he might end up an idiot. When 
I said he already was, she said that 
was just like a man. I tried to get 
her back in my arms, and she beat 
on my chest. Then she cried qn it 
some more.

IF 




By this time Mr. Dome One was 
groanmg and sweating. It was just 
the natural male reaction to about 
ten minutes of watching those 
ripples, but it irritated her again. 
She began to yammer about men be- 
ing all sensual brutes, and she hit 
me two or three times more, but 
by that time her tears and all that 
belting on my casing had bled off 
her overcharge, and she crawled 
back inside the silver globe ‘ and 
went to work. 

Lord only knows what he thought 
was happening to him, but he quit 
groaning and began to purr. Then 
he burst into tears. I never heard a 
man cry like that. After a while he 
quit crying. Then he straightened 
up out of hypnosis and out of the 
chair, put on his air and his shoes, 
and walked out of the place with- 
out looking right or left. 

I just looked at her. She looked 
at me the way a girl does, you 
know, when she’s done something 
wrong, and then she told me what 
she had done. 

S he hadn’t treated him at all. She 
had just induced a euphoric 
feeling in him toward me. “It won’t 
wear off until about this time to- 
morrow,” she told me. “So you’re 
going to go wangle passage for your 
wife and brother-in-law and a job 
for yourself.” I must have looked 
a little startled when she said “wife”, 
for she withered me with a glance 
and said, “Don’t worry. All we want 
out of you is green hills, and you 
can go to hagan.” She made me 
think she meant it, too. 

Wangle is no word for what I 



did. If my native modesty aiid good 
sense hadn’t prevented he would 
have installed me as oommodore of 
the freight fleet. He didn’t have the 
power, but for me he would have 
assumed it. The only regret he had 
was that my job would take me 
away from him. He made mo 
promise to come back and to stay 
with him for several weeks when I 
did. 

You ain’t interested in my trip. 
You can make up better ones. I 
beat her and Brud back by weeks, 
and I was waiting at their landfall. 

I have received severe frostbites 
in space, but none to equal the one 
I got that day. When they were half- 
way home, the berth officer was 
making his daily check to see that 
everybody was taking the nerve tone- 
pills and flexing the large muscle 
groups. He had run the scanner by 
her cubicle every 25 hours, of 
course, but one day he suddenly 
saw the way her name was spelled 
(Mrs. Gallegher, you see?) and 
asked her if she knew me. Then he 
had to go and tell her that old story 
about that crazy woman at Dome 
Four. Well, it was later proved that 
woman was entirely mistaken, you 
know, about the whole thing. Not 
only was the ancient Martian marri- 
age ceremony not performed on that 
occasion, there is no ancient Mar- 
tian marriage ceremony. It was all 
a big mistake. 

But trust this leaky-skulled berth 
officer! That little cathode ray had 
cooked his brains, if you want my 
opinion. We had drunk a million 
liters of rocket fuel together in one 
deadfall or another, and he thought 



CYBERNIA 



89 




he was pulling a big joke, I guess. 
She should have had sense enough 
to know that he was just selling 
shares in the waxworks on Mars, 
but women never know when they’re 
being kidded, especially about some- 
body they’re really interested in. 
That’s how I first knew she really 
was interested in me, she was so 
mad about that old Dome Four 
party. 

But she was madi I couldn’t let 
her walk off: I had to hold on to 
her until we could make enough 
money to square up those passages. 
The boss might get rotated home, 
but they don’t rotate bookkeeping 
entries. 

Old Brud came through for me, 
bless his blubbery psyche, when I 
reminded her how quick we could 
raise the money for his skin sculp- 
ture. I don’t know what I’d have 
done if it hadn’t been for old care- 
less — yes, and I don’t know what 
I’d have done if I’d been him, either. 
You’re right, but don’t look down 
your nose at me. 

W e scrounged up 'enough second- 
hand parts to open up a little 
more sophisticated version of MAR- 
TIANA. I thought up the name 
CYBERNIA, and it sure pulled in 
the suckers that always think a ma- 
chine can do things better than a 
person. I call people like that “punch 
brains.” Most of ’em would have 
been scared to death if they’d re- 
alized a 118 pound girl was knead- 
ing up their brains and baking them 
over, but when they were conned 
into thinking a computer was doing 
it, they were in heaven. 



We set up a learning machine to 
keep them distracted, with levers to 
pull and buttons to push and the 
damnedest set of irrelevant ques- 
tions and answers the hagan you 
ever saw. The motive power for 
the learning machine was supplied 
by two metal treadles. Ah, you 
guessed it, did you? That’s how we 
kept their bare feet grounded into 
the system, and the very first lever 
they pulled or button they pushed 
got our blood sample for us. After 
Cybernia explained to me what she 
was doing, all the information gath- 
ering was simple. You’d be surprised 
what your blood fractions tell about 
where you’ve been and the kind of 
life you’ve led. Hoo-eee, boy! 

With me running the ballyhoo, 
we were rocking right along, sweet 
as a train in a tube, paid off the 
passage money, buying Bruddie 
Swayne a better-looking face than 
the one he’d been born with, and 
I’m actually beginning to think 
about marriage, the genuine, ancient 
Earthman, Me Tarzan You Jane 
This Our Tree ceremony; and I 
know Cybernia is too, because she’d 
josh me about Dome Four and that 
crazy dame, the way a woman will, 
you know, when she knows she’s got 
the key to your air supply. 

Money’s a terrible thing. We got 
to where we were taking in more 
than we could spend, even paying 
up ahead for Brud’s operations and 
treatments. Her conscience was easy 
because she really was doing a 
pretty good job on the lackwits we 
were pulling in. We were getting 
away with it; then it was our mis- 
fortune to get a really big chance.

IF 




I tell you, rich won’t describe it. 
Plutonium strikes on Mars ain’t in 
the same orbit. A man who owned 
all the patents on rocket propulsion 
would have had just the ante in this 
game. 

I knew it was toq good to be true. 
Like when you first start on the run 
to Mars and you think the techs 
have given you a perfect tape be- 
cause you can see Mars about the 
fourteenth week, and you keep on 
seeing her, but you don’t stop to 
think that means you’re undershoot- 
ing until the rescue rockets start 
buzzing around you, throwing grap- 
ples and missing, and cursing you 
for every son of a march they can 
lay tongue to. No, believe me, when 
things look too rosy, that’s the time 
to break gravity and set a no orbit 
course, if it takes every gram of 
fuel you’ve got. 

If I’d lit the tube when I first saw 
that woman . oh, not Cybernia! 
The rich one. Rich one! What a pale 
way that is to describe Dona Luisa. 
Richest one, that’s more like it. 
Squared rich, that’s better: her 

money didn’t just breed like some 
ordinary rich millionaire’s, her 
money cubed itself every twenty 
four hours. 

And the » analyzer couldn’t read 
her! 

Unprecedented, say you? Right 
you are, says I, but that’s another 
pale pink word for what was a raw 
red reality. 

O ne of our suckers brought her 
in. They’d been on a wild orbit 
for three or four days, it looked like, 
and both needed an hour of breath- 



ing CO2 and then about twenty- 
three more on straight oxygen. Cy- 
bemia was a little contemptuous of 
our clientele by this time, and these 
two just fitted her feelings like a 
pigskin glove with the bristles inside. 
She had built a permanent hallucin- 
ation of herself into the machine so 
she didn’t have to be anywhere near 
it, at least not while the prelimin- 
ary trepanning was going on. 

We were in the office, counting 
money. Brud’s new face was paid 
for, and almost grown onto him, too. 
She was thinking about closing down 
and going back to school, she 
that had cozened more cerebellums 
into involuntary sanity than you 
could shake a garlic bulb at; ami I 
was trying to work myself up to the 
“Barkis is willin’ ” routine. Not for 
the money! What’s money? So many 
jets to your credit — it’s like fuel in 
a tank, not worth a hot hagan ’til 
you burn it. I been rich before and 
I’ll be rich again. It’s separating the 
grabbers from their gelt that I en- 
joy. The intellectual pleasure is just 
about balanced by the emotional 
suspense. No, it was the girl. When 
she was in the same room, I itched 
all over; and when shd wasn’t, I 
twitched steady. 

T didn’t know these two drunks 
were any different from our reg- 
ular run of glue sniffers when they 
came in^ And he wasn’t; she was. 

“Here’s my friend. Dona Luisa, the 
richest old bat in Mexico,” he gig- 
gled (talking to the illusion, you 
see). “Her problem is that she thinks 
like a man, Cybernia. Be a sweet 
and reprogram her in the right di- 
rection, won’t you?” 



CYBERNIA 



91 




Cybernia snorted. “Well, that’s 
not his problem anyway.” 

I laughed and got out of her way, 
because it wasn’t really like her to 
be unsympathetic to a sucker (she 
always thought of them as patients, 
you see?), so I knew she was out of 
sorts. 

I should have stayed. Still, I don’t 
know what I could have done. The 
worst happens when you least ex- 
pect it. It was just Fenagle’s Law in 
full, subtle operation. 

I did see the woman on the 
screen. She was a really theatrical 
brunette, with just the first streak of 
gray in her hair. You would p’t see 
the gray when it was done right, 
but now it was all in wild disorder, 
and she was swaying, not like a 
drunk about to fall over, but with 
her feet planted wide, like a votary 
in torment. She had a Zapotec kind 
of face (like the smiler with the 
crown, you know); but she didn’t 
look Zapotec. That lovely Indian 
face was all twisted with some sort 
of inexpressible pain. She had on a 
brocaded dress in gold and silver 
that was snagged and ripped and 
half off, off far enough that you 
could see the figure was genuine: a 
real armful of woman! 

Far gone. She was far gone. Cy- 
bernia’s “globe” voice told her to 
take off her shoes, and with two 
gestures, she took off every stitch 
she had on. That got her ‘Bernie’s 
full attention . .' . and mine too. You 
take a surface car round to the old 
Ministry of Transportation Building 
today after siesta and look at that 
figure Zuniga did of the woman 
with the sheaf of corn on the door 



post by the plaza. That’ll give you 
an idea . only think of that 
face, ravaged with sorrow and 
streaked with tears, and that body 
racked with sobs, begging for help. 

W ith one hand, ‘Bernie hit the 
switch that shut off the tell- 
tale board so I couldn’t see what 
the machines were producing, the 
switch to the screen with the other, 
shot me out the door with a phrase 
I didn’t know she knew,* and slid 
out the other door and into her 
globe — all while that brocade 
dress and its underpinnings were 
still in the air. She had work on 
her hands. 

I should have stayed . but I 
don’t know what I could have done. 
As I say. Dona Luisa defied the 
analyzer. She did what she was 
told, and there was no conscious 
resistance. Couldn’t be, anyway. 
You can’t resist what you don’t 
know is happening. She just didn’t 
come through. 

Cybernia told me it was like 
looking at her “Martian” self. You 
know there’s a body behind those 
mirrors, you know the mirrors are 
there, but still you can’t see any- 
thing but the illusion. 

Only in this case, for somebody 
as used to walking around bare- 
footed in other people’s brains as 
‘Bernie, it was even weirder. Blood 
pressure, temperature, pulse, respira- 
tion, bile dripping out of the liver 
(overworked with all that aged te- 
quila), sweat glands, kidneys, all 
the physical activity was there on 
the board, she told me. But the 
mind! Nothing. Worse than nothing. 



92 



IF 





93 



Static. The physical activity of the 
brain was there, all upside down 
and inside out, but nothing she 
could do to it would make it add 
up to a mind, which after all is 
something wholly different from the 
physical activity in which it’s em- 
bedded. 

She took her head out of the 
globe and went over and looked at 
the woman, Cybernia told me. 
Looked at her, and there she was, 
pumping away at the treadles, pull- 
ing, pu^ng, mouthing her answers, 
sweat pouring off her with effort. 
And back inside the globe, nothing. 
Just a jumble. 

Cybernia was in a research work- 
er’s heaven . and hell at the 
same time. What could be causing 
this woman to louse up the ma- 
chine this way? A happy lifetime 
of a great researcher might go into 
just formulating the right questions. 
Michelson didn’t leave his mark for 
precision experiments, you know . 
it was for asking, “If the ether’s 
there, why doesn’t it slow down this 
light beam?” 

But on the other hand, she 
couldn’t talk to a soul in her field. 
What, and admit she was a party to 
the engaging fraud I had set up 
around her ideas? She was afraid 
they would form a hollow square 
of professors and snip off her Phi 
Beta Kappa, key, or her — some- 
thing, I don’t know. 

Meanwhile the sucker was get- 
ting sicker. ‘Bernie was so fasci- 
nated by the problem, the invisible 
brain, so to speak, that she quit 
watching the money; but Mrs. Gal- 
legher didn’t raise no idiot children. 



and I was raising the ante every 
time our rich lady showed up. 
There didn’t seem to be any figure 
I could name that would make her 
winee. 

S he was always gassed. Maybe 
that’s why. My own catwalk 
diagnosis was that she was going to 
be ignited by some stray spark from 
our machine before we could cure 
her. I don’t know why she came 
back. We weren’t doing her as much 
good as a rust spot in a rocket tube, 
and there are more limits to hyp- 
nosis than you may know. In credits, 
we had to charge her all the thrust 
her engines would stand, though, be- 
cause ’Bernie had cured every other 
customer we had and run them all 
off with a bad taste in the mouth; 
as if she made them feel that when 
they realized how outrageous our 
bills were, then they were well. 

No head for business. She was 
only interested in that invisible 
brain. Bruddie got his certificate, 
gave his new photo to Social Se- 
curity to match his old fingerprints, 
and shipped right out to old Rusty. 

He still thought he was going to 
hit it big in those old high Geiger 
hummocks. 

She hardly knew he was leaving. 
This whole thing grew up out of 
her affection for him, and now she 
gave him a kiss and a “Be care- 
ful” and sent him right back out 
to be cooked whole next time, like 
as not. « 

And heavy as I was drawing on 
Dona Luisa’s fuel, don’t you think 
Cybernia was flaming it faster than 
I could pump it? Between new ma-

IF 




chinery, engineering checks on the 
old, and restructuring the analy- 
tical elements, we ran up bills that 
would have exhausted the Federated 
U.N.’s credit, and they nearly used 
up ours. I tell you, we were as rich 
as a Martian who’s found a good, 
cheap substitute for water. 

As bright as ’Bemie is, still she’s 
logical; and I don’t think she ever 
would have solved the problem if 
Dona Luisa’s brother hadn’t come 
to rescue her from us. He was a 
business man, polite as Charles Vee, 
you know, and just as tough. He 
came in with a little reel of punch- 
ed tape from Banco Longoria’s 
Mexico City branch. 

I knew what was on it: the rec- 
ord of his sister’s payouts to us. 
Every inch of that tape would have 
bought Tenochtitlan ten times over 
the day Cortez first saw it. 

What could I say: “Don Her- 
mano. I’m keeping your sister crazy 
so my girl can have some fun?” or, 
“Say, did you know your sister’s 
head is hollow?” 

’And it was sure no use to try 
the mystery religion angle on him. 
He looked as if he’d been there 
when the water burns and the ser- 
pants talk and hadn’t been a hot 
hagan impress^ed. He had the other 
Zapotec face, big beak nose and 
sharp chin, but still a brother’s re- 
semblance to Dona Luisa. Somehow 
he looked more familiar than that 
to me, but his hair was that shiny 
silver, and I kept trying to see it 
raven wing black, and couldn’t. 

He said, very politely, that he 
wanted to see his sister. I had 
opened Cybernia into the conver- 



sation as soon as he ID’d himself, 
and she put on quite a little show. 
By that time, she had the equip- 
ment to start her own creation, 
pretty near, and she cracked about 
a forty-thousand volt streak of 
lightning through the office. Then 
while we were still fighting the 
ozone, she doused all the lights and 
made the door to the tank creak 
away like a grave opening itself. 

He was tough, though. It never 
shook the ash off that Orizaba cigar 
he was smoking. 

We went out into the tank, and 
there was his sister, peddling away 
on those treadles, and working that 
learning machine like crazy. (Ha 
ha.) Of course my sweetie trans- 
fixed him as soon as she caught 
his eye. We never improved on 
that original ripple technique. It 
always got attention. 

When she had his shoes off and 
put him to work on the treadles. 
Dona Luisa got a rest and in a min- 
ute, Cybernia came swarming out 
of the globe and woke me up. She 
was all excited, but she remem- 
bered to apologize for hypnotizing 
me too. 

S he jerked me in the office and 
switched on the repeaters, and 
just stood there, hands on her hips. 
“Well?” she said. 

“Well, what?” 

I hated to admit to her I couldn’t 
read her dials and pen squiggles. I 
can read tape and punches like 
everyone, and I do a pretty good job 
of hearing when it’s just simple ma- 
chines talking to each other. I never 
walk into a door at a posh restau-

rant, because I can bear the scanner 
ordering the servo mechanism, 
whether it’s Open Sesame or Shut 
Says-me. But her stu^f was just too 
much for me. 

She hit me a couple of times on 
the chest to relieve h^ tension and 
then pointed to the whole board. 
“He’s not there either!” 

Well? Mean anything to you? 
It didn’t to me either, until we got 
to talking it over. First she’d cut 
one of them in, then the other. 
Finally she wheeled in another 
learning machine and kept them 
both at it, walking forty miles a 
day sitting down. 

I’ll say this much. That long a 
course with ’Bemie would sure put 
somebody in shape. Dona Luisa had 
the figure of a once-handsome 
woman when she came to us. Now 
there was no more once upon a 
time about it. She was a magnifi- 
cent incarnation of Indian beauty. 
Of course, ’Bemie didn’t work her 
in the altogether any more (pru- 
dish), but I saw her striding in and 
out. The exercise was bringing the 
rose up under the olive in her com- 
plexion and the lines were dropping 
out of her face. If she’d ever looked 
at herself, she’d have been well. 
But we didn’t even know what it 
was that obsessed her so passionate- 
ly, because she was invisible in the 
only way that, counted. 

First we asked. Could it be all 
Mexican brains are invisible? Didn’t 
make sense. No basic psychologic 
function has ever been found to be 
ethnically determined, let alone na- 
tionally. Then we asked, Could this 
be cultural? And again we said no, 



Mexico hasn’t got that kind of 
homogeneous culture . and there 
was our answer, in reverse. Mexico 
has made the preservation of her 
separate Indian cultures a national 
passion; and these two people 
weren’t like from Acapulco and 
Chihahuahua, one a Nayarit and the 
other a Tarahumara. They were 
from the identical culture. ^ there 
was our answer, and we just needed 
a few more Zapotecs as controls to 
demonstrate it. 

Only it wasn’t. They didn’t. All 
the other Zapotecs we tested showed 
up on the dials as well as I did. 

V 

I n the end, I solved it by being 
clumsy. 

Cybernia thought she had spotted 
a pattern of significance and wanted 
to run the tape back and ^e it on 
the dials again. The takeup reel 
stayed on slow when she reversed, 
and there was a big pileTup before 
she noticed it. I charged in to un- 
snarl it, and tore the tape. In the 
end, the simplest way out was to 
tear off the whole snarled section, 
splice it back in and get it wound 
at the right speed. 

Cybernia was transfixed. The 
splice took aibout three minutes to 
run, and she never said a word. 
Then she had it back. Then she 
had it back again. Finally she belted 
me on the shoulder. “What did you 
do?” 

I looked and turned sick. Here 
she thought she had something, and 
I had just switched tape ends when 
I spliced it. She was seeing all the 



96 



IF 




readings backwards . and upside 
down, you might say. I showed her 
the dark line on the tape was on 
the wrong edge, and kind of ducked. 
I figured she’d hit me with some- 
thing more than her fist. That little 
old gun, maybe. 

Instead, she just played the tape 
back one more time. Then she look- 
ed at me, dead serious, and said, 
“It’s the mark of genius to recog- 
nize the implications of your work, 
even when you didn’t expect them. 
Everything I’ve done has shown me 
that human beings are an infinite 
variety. ‘Normal’ to these machines 
is such a wide spread that it 
wouldn’t be tolerated in a factory 
that manufactured toy rockets. Hu- 
man beings must be a still evolving, 
still mutating species. Here’s the 
living proof that there is no ab- 
normality in electroencephalography 
that isn’t ‘normal’ for somebody.” 

She started cutting switches and 
turning on the hypno-tape that sent 
our sibling subjects out and brought 
them back the next day like a pair 
of flatworms rising to the sun. 

“These two people — brother and 
sister — I’ll bet it’s a family trait 

— dominant, got to be, they’ve 
both got it — they’re just polarized 

— something — the reverse of 
everybody el^e in the world. It’ll 
only be a few days’ work with Dona 
Luisa now that I can see her.” 

So it was; but you don’t take 
somebody through the valley of the 
shadow the way we had la Senora 
without arousing their human de- 
pendence. Dona Luisa was the most 
converted convert in the history of 
psychic technology. It wasn’t the 



conditioning, after a little; I n^n, 
not the conditioning Cybemia had 
given her. It was the deep human 
urge to lean on somebody, or some 
thing. Seemed like la Senora wasn’t 
sure whether it was me or Cybemia 
she owed her sanity to. 

Then the air gave out. What do 
I mean? I mean disaster struck. The 
reactor blew up. Put it any awful 
way you want: the universe col- 
lapsed into the primordial atom and 
then blew up . only I’m still alive 
and in chaos. 

Cybemia unpeeled the inside of 
Dona Luisa’s skull to the very trau- 
ma that had crippled her . and 
don’t you think it turned out it 
happened on a trip she made to 
Mars as a girl? When Cybemia 
found that out, she fixed Dona 
Luisa’s dependence on me as tight 
as the rocket jockey’s suit in the 
story, and she disappeared like 
liquid oxygen on a spring morning. 
I trailed her to London, but they 
said she had come here, so here I 
am . 

H e drew deep on the taro of beer 
in his rusty fist. 

“But, Galeg,” I said, “what has 
a tourist trip to Mars got to do 
with you?” 

At that moment, a giggling troop 
of the professional street urchins 
the government pays to hang around 
the tourist section up on Avenida 
Juarez erupted around the glass 
screen at the door, piping, ^"Senora! 
Aqui! Aquir Gallegher got pur- 
posefully to his feet. 

“Hold ’em off ’til I can get out 
through the kitchen, won’t you? 



CYBERNIA 



97 




Why, it seems Luisa was married 
on Mars. She was a blonde then. 
That’s why I thought I recognized 
Don Hermano, and didn’t recognize 
her. You guessed it: she was 

wedded in the ancient Martian mar- 
riage ceremony. She believes it’s her 
destiny to lay the egg that’ll start 
up Martian evolution again. Crazy, 
no? Pay the tab. I’ll square up at 
your hotel.” 

Just as I was about to remind 
Galleghcr that he didn’t know where 
I was staying and that, in point of 
fact, it was a guest house near the 



bull ring, his Martian tan paled visi- 
bly and he vanished behind the 
ice counter where Prendes displays 
its fresh red snappers. I heard a 
mellow voice cry, “Ah! Ah! My 
Lizard Prince, I am coming! All 
Mars awaits our heir!” 

As I turned to see, I am sorry 
to say a magnificent woman with 
a rosy olive complexion and a 
wild, rolling eye tripped over my 
foot in the aisle. I didn’t wait for 
the waiter to bring me change. There 
wasn’t time!

Science Fiction's Holiday 

by LIN CARTER 

What sf fans do at the end 
of every summer — and why! 



O NCE a year the science-fiction 
world gets together and has it- 
self a sort of birthday party. Tech- 
nically this shindig is termed The 
Annual World Science Fiction Con- 
vention, but this stern, imposing 
label conceals a good excuse for 
science-fiction people — both fans 
and the professional writers, artists 
and editors alike — to have them- 
selves a big party. 

The “Con,” as informal usage 
has it, has been around for more 
than a quarter of a century now, 
and it’s the annual high-point of 
the fannish year. It gives people like 
us a chance to visit a new city 
every year, and hobnob with people 
we know by repute, or through their 
work. Every year the convention 
moves to a different city, on a rota- 
tion system that decides the area 
but not the city. 

Hmm. I can see I’m going to 
have to elucidate. Okay: it’s agreed 
the Con will be held “somewhere” 
in the midwest one year; then on 
the east coast the next; then on 
the west coast; then back to the 
center of the country again. The 



different cities in each region may 
submit a “bid. at this year’s Con- 
vention. If chosen, the winner of the 
bid is host at next year’s Con. 
Naturally, only those cities with a 
healthy, active fan club make a 
bid — or sometimes (as is the case 
this year) two or three smaller 
clubs in nearby cities will sort of 
consolidate to present a stronger bid. 

How did all this get started? 

T here had been “local” conven- 
tionettes just about from the 
very beginnings of science-fiction 
fandom. These were an afternoon 
long, or even lasted a full day, and 
attracted fans and pros in their 
immediate region. But back in the 
late 1930’s, one such little con in 
Newark, New Jersey, attracted such 
a large and enthusiastic gathering 
that it was only a matter of time 
before the idea caught on. This 
particular get-together called itself 
“The First National Science Fiction 
Convention” and could boast of no 
less than 125 attendees! Gosh wow. 
The fan world was agog. And then 



99 





— lo and behold — one group 
put on the First World Science Fic- 
tion Convention. 

The year was 1939. Naturally, 
the place just had to be New York, 
the city where so many major fea- 
tures of the fannish “way of life” 
were inaugurated. The Con had a 
stellar line-up of major speakers: 
famed cover artist Frank R. Paul, 
Ray Cummings (author of The Girl 
in the Golden Atom), John W. 
Campbell, Jr., editor of Astounding 
Science Fiction, and others. An an- 
nouncement was read, reporting the 
establishment of something called 
Arkham House and the forth com- 
ing publication of some sort of a 
memorial volume dedicated to the 
late H.P. Lovecraft and titled The 
Outsider and Others. Attendees 
were urged to support this venture 
and place orders on the spot, the 
price being $3.50. (Yes, 1939 was 
quite a while ago, wasn’t it? To- 
day you’ll see The Outsider offered 
for sale by rare book dealers at 
prices like $150.00!) 

Something like 150 people at- 
tended this first of all Cons. Many 
were famous celebrities of science 
fiction of the day. Jack Williamson 
came from New Mexico. Forrest J. 
Ackerman hove into port from dis- 
tant California (and among his en- 
tourage was a young fan named 
Ray Bradbury). Isaac Asimov and 
Eando Binder were on hand. Despite 
some feuding and disturbances, it 
was a whale of a Convention and 
everybody had a jolly time ... so 
much so that it became a regular 
thing. 

Cons were held thereafter, at dif- 



ferent cities like Denver and New 
Orleans and Los Angeles. Since fans 
have a happy habit of inventing 
slangish neologisms galore, this first 
New York convention was labelled 
“the Nycon.” Other Cons followed 
suit: we had the “Denvention” and 
the “Nolacon” and even a “Paciti- 
con” at the places noted above. 

The annual Con has been held 
every year (except during World 
War II, when things got disrupted 
and a few years were skipped over). 
This year’s Con will be 24th World 
Science Fiction Convention. 

What happens at a World 
Con, anyway? 

A ll sorts of things. Tradition de- 
mands there be a Guest of 
Honor — or “GoH” (remember 
what I said about slang?) at each. 
This gives the science-fiction world 
a chance to honor its most impor- 
tant members. Usually these are 
writers, people like Robert Hein- 
lein, Arthur C. Clarke, Murray 
Leinster. Said GoH makes a major 
speech which is often printed later 
in one of the fanzines. 

Quite often there’s a banquet — 
sometimes with entertainment. One 
such that I attended had Theodore 
Sturgeon whangin’ away on his gui- 
tar during the meal. 

Two staples, but rarely omitted 
from the Con program, are the 
auction (where everyone has a 
chance to bid for things like rare 
books, original paintings used on 
science-fiction magazine covers, au- 
tographed manuscripts and such like, 
including items like clothbound sets 



100 



IF 




of Unknown Worlds complete) and 
the costume ball (where one may 
encounter Martians, robots, Bug 
Eyed Monsters, and a fantastic 
pageant of spectacular creatures). 

And — ever since the 11th Con- 
vention, in Philadelphia (yclept the 
“Philcon”) — there’s been the an- 
nual “Hugo” awards. This silver 
spaceship, named in honor of Hugo 
Gernsback, who founded the first 
professional science-fiction maga- 
zine, Amazing Stories, is awarded 
every year. Actual award categories 
fluctuate a little from Con to Con, 
but it’s generally given to the year’s 
best science-fiction novel, novelette, 
short story, illustrator, professional 
magazine, fanzine and (sometimes) 
to the most promising new writer 
and best dramatic presentation. The 
“Oscar” of science fiction was 
thought of by one Hal Lynch, who 
first suggested the idea of an annual 
award. Hal is, of course, a fan from 
New York. 

Sometimes the Con has a special 
feature. Like the science-fiction bal- 
let at the Newyorkon in 1956. Or 
the “genuine” dianetics demonstra- 
tion at New Orleans. Once in a 
while (and not half as often as I’d 
like), the Con resurrects a classic 
fantasy movie for the delight of 
Con-goers. 

All this formal program stuff to 
the side, gang, the World Con is 
really just an excuse for a week- 
end-long party. Oh, sure you see and 
meet and mingle with science-fiction 
celebrities (and sometimes outside 
celebrities: cartoonist A1 Capp was 
at the Newyorkon, and horror movie 
star Christopher Lee stalked about 



at last year’s Con) — but the most 
fun is had after hours, at the epic 
parties. Conventions, you see, are 
held at large hotels, and out-of- 
towners take suites and rooms in the 
Con hotel — perfect for throwing 
all-night gabfests and holding week- 
end-long parties. 

And the things you’ll remember 
most of all, after the* Con is over 
and you’re back home again, back 
to the humdrum job or classroom, 
are not the speeches and banquets, 
but the little things that happened: 
the chance meetings, the new 
friends made, the old friends met, 
the talks you’ve had with people 
you’ve wanted to talk to for years. 
The two things I most remember 
about my first Convention, after a 
dozen years or more, is having mar- 
tinis with Cyril Kornbluth and trad- 
ing clerihews and limericks, and a 
hilarious two hours over a break- 
fast table shared with Robert Bloch 
(years and years before he wrote 
Psycho and got to be a Real Cele- 
brity). 

Last year, the World Convention 
was in London. (England, that is, 
not Connecticut.) The Guest of 
Honor was one of Britain’s newest 
and most brilliant science-fiction 
writers, Brian W. Aldiss. The fans 
of America were pretty well repre- 
sented, and, of course, the science- 
fiction people from England, Ire- 
land and Scotland were out in force. 
One thing that makes Cons fun is 
getting a good look at a city new 
to you, and the conventioneers from 
the U.S. had an exciting time see- 
ing Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham 
Palace and Big Ben.

ing to this system, eligibility as a 
Con-site shuttles back and forth 
between the east, west and middle 
states. Any foreign city can make 
a bid at any time. If they win, the 
rotation system is merely suspended 
for that year, and resumes when 
next year rolls around. While most 
Cons are situated in the United 
States (which has more fans per 
capita than countries overseas, and 
more active and numerous fan 
clubs), the Con is, of course, a 
World Convention. London has been 
the Convention city twice now, and 
Toronto, Canada, has also been host 
to the science-fiction world. 

This year (according to the ro- 
tation system), the midwest gets the 
Convention. Then, in 1967, it will 
be one of the larger cities on the 
East Coast. 1968 will see a World 
Con somewhere along the Pacific. 
But let’s get back to this year. 

Where'll you be this 
Labor Day Weekend? 

T his year the science-fiction 
world salutes Cleveland, Ohio, 
and fans and professionals from all 
the fifty states and several Euro- 
pean countries will be gathering 
there for the 24th World Science 
Fiction Convention. 

The place: the Sheraton-Cleve- 
land Hotel on Public Square. Very 
convenient for out-of-town travelers. 
It’s located right above the Cleve- 
land railway terminal; and it’s the 



first stop for transportation if you’re 
coming from the airport. There are 
five restaurants in the hotel, no less, 
and one of them is happily open 24 
hours a day, so you can have some 
hot coffee after one of those all- 
night-long parties. The time is the 
Labor Day “long” weekend — Sep- 
tember 2, 3, and 4, not to mention 
5. Information about the Conven- 
tion can be had by writing the 24th 
World Science Fiction Convention, 
Box 1372, Cleveland, Ohio, 44103. 

There’ll be^ a costume ball and 
a banquet. Prizes will be given for 
the Most Beautiful {costume, that 
is, not the person inside it). Most 
Authentic (that is, if you want to 
come as Gandalf the Gray or Conan 
the Cimmerian or Captain Future, 
make sure you’ve got the details 
straight), and several others. One 
possible category is Best Presenta- 
tion: that is, if you want to appear 
in a cloud of smoke or plan to en- 
ter the ball hall (well, what else 
can I call it?) being chased by a 
dinosaur — you’ve got a good 
chance of copping that one. People 
planning a costume appearance with 
special effects are begged to consult 
the costume ball administration (care 
of box number above) for official 
cooperation. 

There’ll be tables for hucksters, 
too. That is, people wanting to sell 
books, magazines, original cover art, 
science-fiction curiosities, fanzines 
and other stuff. So bring plenty of 
loose cash. 

Guest of Honor at Cleveland’s 
Convention will be L. Sprague de 
Camp, who has been writing fan- 
tasy and science fiction since the 

IF 



102 




1940’s. You’ve seen his name on 
a shelf or two ol your favorite books 
— Lest Darkness Fall, The Incom- 
plete Enchanter, Land of Unreason, 
An Elephant For Aristotle, and a 
couple dozen more. Mr. de Camp 
is a globe-trotter who intersperses 
writing science fiction and fantasy 
with some marvelous historical nov- 
els and non-fiction books on archeo- 
logy and ancient history. He is 
about nine feet tall, bearded as a 
Viking god, speaks forty-seven lan- 
guages (including those of Lost At- 



lantis and Sunken Lemuria), and is 
one of the most witty, urbane and 
entertaining speakers you could ever 
wish to meet. He usually appears in 
a cloud of smoke, and I hope the 
costume ball administration has 
warned everybody. 

This Con is to be known as “the 
Tricon,” by the way. Reason is, 
three cities — Cleveland, Cincinnati 
and Detroit — consolidated their 
convention bids. 

So . will we be seeing you 
there? END

R oan and his three men walked, 
guns in their hands, along the 
echoing corridor. No one challenged 
them. 

“Why don’t we pull out now, 
chief?” Sidis demanded. “We can 
take our pick of the tubs on the 
ramp.” 



“That isn’t what I came for,” 
Roan said. “I have unfinished busi- 
ness ito take care of.” 

“Why bother knocking off any 
more of these Terries?” Askor quer- 
ied. “Not much sport in it, if you 
ask me.” 

“I didn’t!” Roan snapped. “Keep 
your mouth shut and your eyes 
open! We’re not in the clear yet.

What Has Gone Before 



Roan Cornay, a human born in mysterious circumstances on the 
outworld Tambooi, grows up among aliens and is kidnapped by a 
traveling Extravaganzoo. The 'zoo's ship is destroyed by the pirate 
Henry Dread, whose band Roan joins. Henry's own ship is destroyed in 
an encounter with a Niss vessel and Roan shoots Henry in an argument. 
Roan then assumes command of a lifeboat, boards the Niss ship, finds it 
long deserted; but it contains a captured Imperial Terran Navy ship 
which Roan and his crew take over. Roan, seeking his true origin and 
fabled Terra, heads for Tambooi and finds the old family slave, T'hoy 
hoy, who can tell him of his origins only that he is pure blood human 
and that he was bought as an embryo at the Thieves' Market. 

Roan finds the sleazy agency dealing in embryos and forces the 
ancient being who sold him to show him his record, which reveals that 
Roan originally came from an experimental station on Alpha Centauri 
and was the only survivor of a shipment of embryos. Roan heads for 
Alpha Centauri, Rim Headquarters for the Imperial Terran Navy, turns 
his ship over to one of the crew and goes with only his three toughest, 
most loyal men toward the Imperial Terran Navy headquarters on sec- 
ond from Centaurus. As Roan, Askor, Sidis and Poion approach ITN 
headquarters, their lifeboat is boarded by Imperial Terran Navy men. 
Roan tricks the ITN Commander into turning over his vessel to him, and 
takes the ship into Rim Headquarters. 

Roan is then entertained at a luxurious dinner party by Commo- 
dore Quex, a cruel, decadent humanoid who tells Roan, at knife point, 
that it was he who stole the batch of human embryos from Starbird's 
keeping, and that in turn the embryos were pirated by the Shah of the 
Gallian planet, who was at that moment deposed and the embryos 
stolen again and at that point were brought to the Thieve's Market on 
Tambooi. Roan and his three men overcome a murderous attack by 
Quex anrd his crew, and Roan kills Quex, who requests an honorable 
death. 

Trishinist wasn’t at the party — or dozen more men, emerging from 
any of his men.” the shelter of tattered drapes and 

A thunderclap racketed along chipped marble columns, peering 

the corridor. Roan spun, went flat, down from a wrought-metal gallery, 
“Hold your fire!” he roared, guns ready. 

Trishinist tittered and stepped out of “I heard the, er, sounds of cele- 
the half-open door that had con- bration,” the Terran confided. “It 

cealed him. There was at least a seemed wise to have a chat with 



EARTHBLOOD 



105 




you before you, ah, continue with 
what you’re about.” 

“We’ve already talked,” Roan 
snapped. ‘Tell your Terries to put 
their guns away before my men get 
nervous and shix)t them out of their 
hands.” 

“Umm. You Geeks do look effi- 
cient. Still, I daresay one or two of 
my chaps would live long enough 
to dispatch the four of you. So per- 
haps we’d best call a truce.” 

Roan got to bis feet. His men 
stood, facing outward in a tight cir- 
cle. 

“I have an appointment with Ad- 
miral Starbird,” Roan said. “Or have 
you forgottwi?” 

“I remember,” Trishinist said 
quickly. “You haven’t, um, changed 
your plans?” 

“Why should I?” 

“I thought pwbaps — after all the 
excitement <rf the banquet — ” 

“You knew about Quex’s plans for 
the evening?” 

“I suspected something of the sort 
might take place. After all, stran- 
gers . .” 

“Thanks for letting me know.” 

“Well, if you couldn’t handle that 
group — what good are you to me, 
ummm?” 

“We’re going on now,” Roan said. 

“Just so,” Trishinist agreed. “But 
leave the guns.” 

Roan looked at Trishinist. There 
were small bubbles at the corners of 
his mouth. 

“All right,” he said. “Put ’em 
down, men.” 

“W^at for. Boss?” Askor inquired. 

“Sidis still has his knife. That’s 
all he needs.” 



Trishinist shuddered. Roan tossed 
his gun aside. The others followed 
suit. 

“Now what, Chief?” Sidis asked. 
“Now we get on with the job,” 
Roan turned on his heel and started 
toward the apartment of Admiral 
Starbird. 

I t was silent on the corridor. The 
guards on the admiral’s door 
were gone. Roan stopped, faced 
Trishinist. 

“Send your Men away,” He said. 
“You can stay. Keep your gun, if 
you feel like it.” 

Trishinist lifted his lip to show 
his pearly teeth. “You’re giving me 
orders?” he said in a wondering 
tone. 

“You want them to see it?” 
Trishinist started. “I see,” he mur- 
mured. He turned, gave crisp or- 
ders. All but four of the Men turn- 
ed, formed up in a squad, marched 
away. 

“They’ll be waiting,” Trishinist 
cooed. “Now — ” 

The door behind Roan clicked and 
swung in. Admiral Starbird stood in 
the opening, a gun in his hand. 
“Ten — shunr he commanded. 

Trishinist’s Men instinctively 
straightened and in the instant’s 
pause, Askor, standing nearest them, 
swung and brought his hand down 
like an axe across the neck of one, 
caught his gun as it fell, swiveled 
on the next as he brought his gun 
around and the two weapons fired 
as one. The guard spun, falling, his 
gun still firing. A vivid scar raked 
the wall and door jamb and caught 
Admiral Starbird full in the chest.

IF 




The old man slammed back against 
the wall. He fell slowly, sprawling 
full length in a growing stain of 
brilliant crimson. 

Trishinist made a noise like re- 
pressed retching and stumbled back. 
Askor brought his gun around as 
the remaining two guards backed, 
white with shock but with guns lev- 
eled on Roan and his crew. 

“You’ve killed him,” Trishinist 
gasped. “The Admiral is dead!** 

“I can nail the pair of youse, 
easy,” Askor grinned at the gun- 
ners. “Who’s first?” 

Roan knelt at Starbird’s side, ig- 
noring the confrontation of guns. 

“Admiral.” He tried the pulse at 
the corded veins of the wrist. There 
was a faint flutter. “Get your doc- 
tors, Trishinist!” 

“Yes . yes . Fetch Surgeon 
Splie, Linerman! Hurry!” A man 
turned and darted away. 

Starbird’s eyes opened. He stared 
at the men holding guns aimed at 
Roan. “At ease,” he said, and died. 

“You killed the admiral,” Roan 
said slowly, looking up at Trishinist. 

“Not I,” Trishinist gasped, back- 
ing. “It was an accident. I won’t have 
that on my conscience. It was them!” 
He pointed at the two guards. “Blun- 
derers!” he croaked. “You’ve killed 
a man of the True Blood!” 

“Not me, Captain! Strigator was 
the one!” The guards looked shaken, 
still covering Roan and Poion while 
Askor covered them. 

“Shall I kill ’em?” Askor asked. 

“Cover Trishinist.” Askor’s gun 
flicked to point at the small Man’s 
chest. Poion licked his lips and eyed 
the gun on the floor. 



“Don’t try it,” Askor rumbled. 
“You have no chance,” Trishinist 
said weakly, his eyes on the gun in 
Askor’s hands. “Surrender and I’ll 
deal leniently with you.” 

“Give us a ship,” Roan said. 
“We’ll go quietly.” 

“You with the gun, Trishinist ad- 
dressed Askor. “Give up that wea- 
pon and you’ll go free.” 

“What about the Cap’n and these 
two lunkheads?” 

*'You*ll go free. Never mind about 
them.” 

Askor grinned, holding the gun 
steady. 

“Very well, then. There’s been 
enough bloodshed. You’ll all go 
free.” 

4 4T’11 keep the gun,” Askor said. 

X “But I won’t use it unless I 
have to. How about that boat now?” 
“Certainly.” Trishinist licked his 
lips. “I’ll give the orders. But only 
after you surrender the gun.” Sweat 
was trickling down the small Man’s 
face. 

“What about it, Cap’n?” 

“Do I have your word as a Man?” 
Roan asked. “A ship, and no pur- 
suit — for all four of us?” 

Trishinist nodded quickly. “Yes, 
of course. My word on it.” 

“All right, Askor,” Roan said. 
“Wait a minute, Boss!” 

“Don’t do it. Chief,” Sidis bark- 
ed. “Askor can get the both of ’em 
while they’re shooting us! Then him 
and you can take fancy-pants here 
fer a hostage — ” 

Roan shook his head. “Put the 
gun down.” 

Askor made a jabbing motion to- 



EARTHBLOOD 



107 




ward Trishinist, and the Captain 
jumped back. Askor laughed and 
tossed the gun aside with a clatter. 
Roan faced Trishinist. 

The Man took out a handkerchief, 
mopped at his face. 

“Very well,” he said. He made a 
curt gesture to the two armed men. 
“Take these stupid pigs to D level.” 

With a bellow Poion jumped. The 
guard’s gun shrieked and sp>outed 
blue lightning, and Poion whirled 
and fell, smoke churning from a gap- 
ing, blackened wound in his chest. 
He groaned and rolled on his back, 
and charred ribs showed before the 
blood welled out to hide the sight. 

“Askor! Sidis!” Roan snapped. 
“Stand fast! That’s an order!” 

Roan looked at Trishinist, smil- 
ing. “You surprise me. Captain,” he 
said. “I didn’t think even a traitor 
like you would disgrace his Man- 
hood in front of a couple of cross- 
bloods.” 

Trishinist tore his eyes from 
Roan’s. “There’s been enough kill- 
ing. I’m ill with killing. Take them 
away — alive.” He turned back to 
Roan. “I have every right to execute 
you — all of you — out of hand. I’m 
sparing your lives. Consider your- 
selves lucky. You’ll be questioned, 
of course — later.” He turned and 
stalked away. 

“Poion,” Roan called. “Are you 
. can you . .?” 

^“I have taken my death-wound. 
Captain,” Poion gasped. “How 
strange . that so many years of 
life . can end in such ... a little 
moment . and the worlds go on 
without me . .” 

“So long, Poion,” Sidis said. “Take 

108 



a pull at the Helhhorn for me.” 

“Nice try, old pal,” Askor said 
hoarsely. “I think maybe you’re the 
lucky one.” 

The Man who had gone for the 
doctor came up with a short fat Man 
in tow. He glanced at the Admiral, 
shuddered, shook his head. 

“What about him?” A guard point- 
ed at Poion. The doctor purs^ his 
lips at the wound. “No chance,” he 
said and turned away. 

“Surgeon — have you ... no medi- 
cine to cure the pain of living . .” 
Poion whispered. 

“Hmmmph.” The doctor opened 
a small case, took out a hypospray, 
pressed it briefly against Poion’s 
laboring chest. A breath sighed out 
and then there was silence. 

“Let’s go,” the guard said. 

XXXIII 

A skor reached up and gripped the 
chain that linked the manacle 
on his left wrist to a ring set high 
in the concrete wall. He pulled him- 
self up high enough to see through 
the foot-square barred opening in 
the cell wall. He grunted and drop- 
ped back. 

“Nothing, Cap’n. Some kind of 
tunnel, I guess. We’re fifty feet un- 
derground anyways.” 

Sidis squatted at the end of his 
tether near the door, angling the 
blade of his polished machete 
through the bars to catch the faint 
light from along the corridor. 

“They’s a guard post about thirty 
yards along,” he said. “One Terry 
with a side-arm.” 

“You shoulda let us jump ’em 

IF 




Cap’n,” Askor said. “It woulda been 
better than this crummy joint. It 
stinks.” He wrinkled his wide nose 
to dramatize the odor. 

“I can smell it,” Roan said. “And 
as long as we’re alive to smell things 
we still have a chance.” 

Sidis was eyeing the barred door. 
“Them bars don’t look so tough,” 
he said. “I bet I could bend ’em — 
if I could reach ’em.” 

“What do you figure’ll happen, 
Chief?” Askor said. 

“As soon as Trishinist recovers 
his stomach, he’ll be along to find 
out who sent us and why,” 

Askor guffawed. “That’ll be a 
laugh,” he said. “He’ll twist and 
slice us till he makes a mess a mud- 
pig would puke at, but we won’t tell 
him nothing. We can’t. We don’t 
know nothing! That’ll gravel him.” 
“If we was to bend them bars,” 
Sidis said, “one of us could slide 
out and get to the joker with the 
blaster. Then he could come back 
and bum them chains off.” 

“Wise up,” Askor said. “You got 
to get the chain off the first one 
first.” 

Sidis hefted his machete. “They 
left me this,” he said thoughtfully. 
“Them crazy Terries. I guess they’re 
so used to guns they forgot a knife’s 
a weapon too,” 

“So what? It won’t cut chromal- 
loy.” 

Sidis backed from the wall until 
the six-foot chain attached to his 
wrist came taut. 

“How much time you think we 
got, Cap’n?” he asked. 

“They’ll be along soon.” 

Sidis licked his lips. “Then I bet- 



ter get moving.” He brought the 
machete up and with one terrific 
stroke severed his left hand. 

T hey stood in a dark room, amid 
a jumble of piping and tanks. 
“Smells like a derelict’s bilge,” 
Askor snorted. 

“Dead end,” Sidis grunted. His 
stump was bound in rags torn from 
Askor’s shirt and there was a tour- 
niquet around his massive upper 
arm^ His face looked pale and damp. 

Roan went to the center of the 
room, studying the floor. “Maybe 
not,” he said. 

Askor came up. There was a three- 
foot metal disk set in the floor, with 
a ring near its edge. 

Roan gripped the ring and lifted 
the lid, exposing a dark hole and 
the rungs of a corroded ladder. 
Water glistened at the bottom. 

The voices outside were suddenly 
louder. Askor stepped to the door, 
looked out. “Oh-oh. They’re right on 
our tail.” 

“I hope they get here quick,” 
Sidis said. “I don’t want to miss 
nothing.” 

“Are you well enouh to travel?” 
Sidis nodded. “Never better. 
Chief.” He took a step, staggered, 
then stood firm. 

“Askor, you go first,” Roan said 
quickly. “Sidis, you follow him.” 
“Too bad we had to burn the 
door. We could maybe of foxed 
’em.” Askor started down the lad- 
der. “Come on, Sidis. Shake it up.” 
“I’ll stay here,” he said. “They 
got to pass the door one at a time, 
and Gut-biter’ll get all the action he 
wants.” 



EARTHBLOOD

“Down the hole,” Roan snapped. 
“Fast!” 

“Cap’n, I ain’t — ” 

“That’s an order!” 

Sidis started down, awkwardly, 
one-handed. 

“Hey, Chief, wonder where this 
thing leads to?” Askor’s voice echo- 
ed from below. 

Roan knelt at the manhole. “If 
you’re lucky, it will take you out to 
a drainage ditch in the open.” 

Sidis turned his tatooed face up. 
“What’s that mean, Boss? If we*re 
lucky?” 

“Fm covering you,” Roan said. 
“I’ll give you a ten minute start and 
then follow.” 

Sidis started back up. Roan put 
out a hand. “If you get clear, wait 
for me ten minutes. Maybe they’ll 
miss the door.” 

Below, Askor was shouting: “Hey, 
what’s that? What’s Cap’n saying?” 
“Shut up and get moving. If you 
get through, come back and get me. 
With our cruiser you can blow this 
place wide open.” 

“We ain’t going without you, 
Cap’n. You know better’n — ” 
“They won’t kill me,” Roan said. 
“I’m Pure Strain, remember? They’d 
burn you two down on sight.” 

“We come this far, we ain’t — ” 
“Did you ever hear of discipline?” 
Roan s^id harshly. “This is our only 
chance. If I’ve tried to teach you 
anything, it’s how to follow orders 
like Men instead of behaving like a 
bunch of Geeks!” 

Sidis looked at Roan. “If that’s 
what you want, Cap’n. But we’ll 
come back. You stay alive, Cap’n.” 
“I’ll stay alive. Get going!” 



When they were gone, Roan slid 
the manhole cover back in place 
and turned to face the door. 

C aptain Trishinist lounged behind 
the wide desk in the office 
recently vacated by Admiral Star- 
bird. 

“Why?” he repeated sourly. “Sev- 
enty-two hours, holed up in a filthy 
sewage pumping room, without food, 
drink or sleep, aiming a gun at the 
door. Why? You mhst have known 
you’d be taken in the end.” 

Roan blinked at the fog before 
him. His head ached and his throat 
was like dried husks. 

“Was it just for that precious pair 
of animals?” The captain’s eyes 
seemed to glitter as he stared at 
Roan. “What hold had they on 
you?” 

“Did they get clear?” Roan ask- 
ed. His voice was blurry with fa- 
tigue. 

“You’re a fool,” Trishinist said. 
“But you’ll talk to me in time. There 
are methods for dealing with recal- 
citrants — effective methods.” 

“I’ll bet they got through,” Roan 
said. “Your kind couldn’t stop 
them.” 

“Oh-hoh, you think to tempt me 
to angry disclosures!” The captain 
smirked. “How really quaint.” 
“You’re so quaint you stink,” 
Roan said. “But you can’t touch me. 
You’re afraid to. You’d gut your 
own grandmother and make bon- 
fires out of children, but you can’t 
kill a real Terry.” 

Trishinist glowered. “Don’t press 
me too far, spy!” 

Roan laughed aloud. “You’re a 

IF 



110 




poor half-breed with pretensions, 
Trishinist. You’re pitiful. Even my 
poor Gooks got past you.” 

Trishinist was on his feet, shaking 
with rage. “Your wretched crea- 
tures died in unspeakable agony an 
hour after you saw them last!” 

“You’re a liar,” Roan said. 

Trishinist spewed saliva and fury. 
“Dead!” he screeched. “I took them 
and stripped the hide from them 
alive!” 

“Prove it. Show me the bodies.” 

“I’ll show you nothing! Slave! 
Traitor! Spy! What need have I to 
prove — ” 

Roan laughed in his face. “Good 
for Askor. I knew he’d get through. 
I hope he stole one of your better 
ships.” 

“Take him away!” Trishinist 
screamed. “Put him in the Hole. Let 
him rot there!” 

The Man holding the rope looped 
around Roan’s neck jerked it, and 
Roan stumbled and almost fell. 

“And when you’re ready to tell 
me your heart’s secrets, beg. And 
perhaps! Perhaps! I’ll find time to 
listen!” 

Trishinist was still fulminating as 
Roan was led along the corridor. 
The rope urged him roughly through 
a small door into a paved court, 
across it and out onto dry hard- 
packed dirt. The air was cold here, 
and the sparse stars of the Rim 
gleamed through mist. Roan stum- 
bled on, determined not to fall. 

The tugging at the rope stopped 
at last, and a rough hand shook him. 

“Don’t go to sleep standing up, 
you. Grab the rope — unless you 
want to hang!” 



He took the slack rope on his 
hands, looping it around his fore- 
arms, and a blow on the back sent 
him reeling forward. And then he 
was falling, and his arms felt as 
though they had been torn from their 
sockets as he brought up short. He 
felt himself descending, the taut rope 
trembling in his grip. Above, the 
circle of dark-glowing slcy dwindled. 
Down, down — 

He slammed the mucky bottom 
with a force that knocked him flat. 
There was a whistling, and the coils 
of rope fell down about him. Far 
above, someone called: 

“Trishinist won’t kill ye, maybe, 
bucko! But if you die on your own, 
that’s yer privilege!” 

A t first, Roan was hungry all the 
time. He was so hungry he 
chewed on the rope, and so thirsty 
he licked at the water that dripped 
everlastingly along the muddy cir- 
cumference of the pit. And he tried, 
again and again, to climb the slimy 
sides of the hole. He scraped hand 
and foot holds with his fingers, even 
after his nails had broken off, and 
always the crevices he made oozed 
away. And once, when he’d gotten 
several feet up, someone flashed a 
light in to watch him, and laughed 
when he fell. Roan lay where he’d 
fallen, listening as the laughter echo- 
ed down the hollow hole. 

One evening the old Man threw 
down the bread and then something 
else, something alive and bristly that 
struck Roan on the arm. As it leap- 
ed across his hand it bit him. It was 
hard to make out the shape of the 
thing in the dim twilight of the hole. 



EARTHBLOOD

but it had red eyes that glittered and 
it seemed to be bigger than Roan’s 
foot. 

Its frightened bite made a vicious, 
screaming kind of pain and Roan 
could feel the blood oozing from his 
hand. He found the bread and then 
sat in the dark, his back against the 
cold, wet mud of the wall that soak- 
ed into the tatters of his clothes, 
and ate. He no longer longed for a 
bath, just as he no longer felt hun- 
gry all the time. He watched the 
red eyes glitter in the dark, listened 
for the scrabble of its claws. It leap- 
ed at the walls again and again, and 
fell back with a thud and a splash. 
Once in its panic it ran over Roan’s 
lap and then leaped at the slime of 
the wall again. 

Then, finally exhausted, it stop- 
ped, and crouched across the floor 
from Roan, panting horribly, loud 
as a Man. The panting slowed, and 
Roan watched, his hand aching, 
thinking of ways to kill the thing — 
later, when he felt better . 

Roan awoke with a start. The ro- 
dent had crept to his foot, attempted 
to gnaw his ankle. He kicked out, 
cursing. The rat retreated a few feet, 
sat watching him, sensing his weak- 
ness. 

Roan felt fhe gashed skin of his 
ankle, the slippery blood. The bite on 
his hand ached, a swelling, throbbing 
ache. He was dizzy and hot now 
and wiping his forehead, Roan real- 
ized it was dry. feverish. He shut 
out from his mind every thought ex- 
cept the need to survive. He wasn’t 
going to be eaten alive by a rat at 
the bottom of a dark hole. Some- 
how, he was going to escape, and 



get to Terra. And if it was impos- 
sible, he’d do it anyway. 

4 4X^e still alive, boy?” came tiie 
jL voice. 

Roan, startled, came out of his 
sleep. He saw the head silhouetted 
against the dark sky above. 

“Yes, curse you. I’m still alive and 
so is the rat. Double the rations.” 

The old Man laugjhed. ’ “Got no 
orders to double the ration.” 

The bread struck one side of the 
hole, bounced to the other and the 
rat ran out, went for the crumbs 
that the bouncing had dislodged. 

Roan stood, shakily, pulled off his 
heavy metal-linked belt, tied his trou- 
sers in a knot at the top. They were 
inches too wide for him now, and 
the blades of his hips jutted out like 
knives. His dizziness turned to nau- 
sea whenever he moved. His strength 
had gone out of his body and into 
the earth . 

Roan held the belt by one end, 
walked toward the rat, then swung 
with all his strength. 

He caught the rodent as it turned 
to dart away and it screamed a 
woman’s scream, kicking in the mud, 
filling the already fetid air with its 
smell of fear. Roan felt his knees 
going. He fell, lay in the mud, list- 
ening to the death struggle. Roan 
was afraid to believe it even when 
he could feel the death in it, so he 
strangled it again with his hands. 

And knowing his weakness and 
starvation were probably going to 
kill him, feeling half insane but 
knowing he must have nourishment, 
he skinned the rat with the sharp 
edge of his belt buckle, and ate it.

I t was three days and nights before 
the fever went away; Roan tried 
to rebuild his strength by pacing the 
circumference of the hole and swing- 
ing his arms, but he found it harder 
to exercise his mind, and sometimes 
all day would go by and it would 
seem like a minute, and other times 
a night would seem like centuries 
and the only time anything different 
happened was when it rained and 
the water rose knee-deep before it 
drained away. And time passed . 

Then, one evening the old Man 
didn’t come with the bread. Nor the 
next. And Roan could do nothing 
but wait, wait eternities. The stars 
came and went and came again, 
and Roan, trapped for so long in the 
dark, slimy pit, wondered if indeed 
he had died and this was what death 
was — an aching and a waiting for- 
ever and all of the world a circle 
of changing sky fifty feet above. 
Roan lay in one spot against the 
wall and ignored the pain in his 
stomach. He tried to sleep, and per- 
haps dream of Stellaraire and of 
food. Stellaraire bringing him food, 
feeding him the delicacies of a hun- 
dred worlds washed down with an- 
cient Terran wines, Stellaraire smil- 
ing .. and fading. The food dis- 
appeared and Gom Bulj was yelling 
and Henry Dread was yelling and . 

Someone was yelling, up above, a 
head silhouetted against dark sky. 

Roan saw the rope dangling in 
front of him. Was it real? For a 
long time it didn’t seem worth the 
trouble of reaching up to find out. 
He had waited so long . 



But he did reach up, almost with- 
out hope that it was a real rope, real 
people calling him to loop the rope 
around his waist. But he complied, 
and the rope pulled, lifting him, and 
it hurt, and he grabbed the rope, 
thinking he would never reach the 
top. Probably there was no top. 

Then hard hands were on him, 
lifting him up, and a broad, ugly 
face was bending over him, and he 
saw the glint of light on filed steel 
teeth. 

“Gee, Boss,” Sidis said. And Roan 
had the strange thought that it must 
be raining, because there was water 
running down the leathery face. 

“You Gooks . took your time 
. .” Roan said. And then Askor 
was there, grinning a meat-eating 
grin, and their faces were prettier 
than any faces Roan had ever seen. 
He smiled. 

Smiling, he let it all go and whirl- 
ed down into the bottomless soft 
night. 

4 4T7at slowly,” a testy voice said 
from somewhere; Roan’s 
eyes were almost shut against the 
bright light. “And not too much.” 

Roan sipped a brothy soup, the 
bowl trembling in his hands. After 
the soup the doctor poked him, 
shone lights in his ears and mouth 
and whistled. “I’m giving you a 
walloping shot of vitastim,” he said. 
“You’ll feel human in about an 
hour. But don’t overdo it. Unless, 
of course, you want to,” he added. 

Askor and Sidis hustled him into 
a hard shower, gave him a brush to 
scrub with. Then they let him sleep. 
By the time Roan had on a uniform 



114 



IF 




which almost fit his bone-thin body, 
he’d come back to himself. The face 
that looked back at him from the 
mirror was a stranger’s. A gaunt, 
old-looking, deep-eyed stranger. And 
the hair above his ears had silver 
streaks in it. But Roan grinned at 
the reflection. 

“We’re alive,” he said. And be- 
hind him, Askor and Sidis smiled, 
too. 

“Let’s go, men,” Roan said. 
“There’s nothing more here for us.” 

A board the stolen light cruiser 
Heirs Whore with an hour’s run 
in space. Roan relaxed in the big 
padded First Officer’s chair, study- 
ing the pattern of lights on the 
screen. 

“I’m glad you two showed up 
when you did,” he said. “But it was 
pretty stupid of the two of you to 
try it alone.” 

“We wasn’t alone. Boss,” Sidis 
corrected. “We had their best bucket 
here. Tough we had to wait around 
out there on Four for three months 
to get a crack at her, but you know 
there wasn’t much left of the old 
Rage of Heaven” 

“Nice work, taking a cruiser with 
that hulk,” Roan said. “Maybe 
you’re learning after all.” 

“Nothing to it. They thought they 
was taking us.” 

“I wish I’d been there — instead 
of where I was.” 

“You didn’t miss nothing.” Sidis 
flashed his teeth and examined the 
tip of the steel toothpick with which 
he had been grooming them. “It was 
kind of pitiful, them bums pulling 
guns on us.” 



“And that’s what they call the 
Imperial Terran Navy,” Askor snick- 
ered. “Them nancies — ” 

“Those weren’t real Terries,” Roan 
said. “That was just some sort of 
rag-tag gipsy outfit using the name. 
The real Terries are on Terra.” 

“I heard of it,” Sidis said doubt- 
fully. But I thought — Hey, Cap- 
tain, we ain’t going there, are we?” 
“Why shouldn’t we go there?” 

“I dunno. I figured maybe you 
was still looking for the ITN like 
Cap’n Dread.” 

“I’ve seen enough of the ITN for 
now,” Roan said shortly. He rose 
and picked up the folded garments 
of blue and silver polyon which he 
had replaced with the old familiar 
ship-clothes, tossed them to Sidis. 

“What’ll I do with this stuff?” 
Sidis asked, holding the Terran uni- 
form. 

“Burn it,” Roan said. 

XXXV 

S ol was a brilliant jewel to star- 
board of Hells Whore and new 
the tiny, faint points of lights that 
were Sol’s planets could be seen. 
Roan tried to pick out the one that 
might be Terra. But he couldn’t be 
sure. It was a double planet. Star- 
bird had said, but the faint compan- 
ion. Luna, would be too dim to see 
at this distance. 

There was the usual buzz of inter- 
stellar noise as he switched the re- 
ceiver on, but nothing else. He took 
the microphone and began trans- 
mitting. “Imperial Terran Cruiser 
Hells Whore calling Niss headquar- 
ters . .”

“Wtiat makes you think they speak 
Panterran, Boss?” Sidis ask^ ner- 
vously. He had been nervous ever 
since they sighted the great, silent 
Niss ship. 

“They did five thousand years 
ago,” Roan said. 

“How long’s it been since anyone 
tried to run the blockade?” Askor 
inquired. 

“Four hundred years,” Roan said. 
“They didn’t make it.” 

“Swell,” Sidis muttered. 

“We ought to be in detector range 
now,” Roan said calmly. He adjusted 
controls; a meteorite flashed around 
the repulsion field of the ship’s hull. 
The image grew or the screens. 

“She’s a big baby,” Sidis said. 

“No bigger than the last one,” 
Askor pointed out. 

“Yeah — it was dead,” Sidis con- 
ceded. “But what if this one ain’t?” 

“Then we’ll get blasted into the 
Nine Hells. Why?” 

“Just asking,” Sidis said, and then 
they watched the screen in silence. 

U p close, the Niss ship looked 
familiar, even to the characters 
sprawled across the dark curve of 
the hull. It was a twin to the dread- 
naught they had boarded after Hen- 
ry Dread’s death, so many years be- 
fore. Immense, ancient, dead. 

It took an hour with a cutting 
torch to force an* opening. Dead air 
whistled, stilled. Inside, sealed in 
their atmosphere suits. Roan and his 
men walked along the narrow, emp- 
ty, dim passageways, remembering 
the route, passing the little piles of 
dust and fish bones that had been 
Niss warriors. 



In the control room there was an 
ancient, abandoned-looking uniform 
jacket hanging over the back of the 
pilot’s chair — the first garment they 
had seen. Roan came closer to the 
control board. 

“Terran!” an echoing voice said. 
“Stand where you are!” 

Roan slipped his power pistol from 
its holster. 

“Drop your weapon!” The voice 
was hollow, alien as not even a 
Geek’s voice was alien, and ^filled 
with an inexpressible weariness. 

Roan stopped breathing for a mo- 
ment. Askor and Sidis stood behind 
him, silent. 

“Never mind,” the voice came 
again. “Keep your gun, Terran. I 
cannot keep this up. And I am dy- 
ing, so there is no need to shoot 
me.” The chair moved, swung 
around. In it was draped a creature 
that looked like a long, crushed 
polyon bag with something rotten 
in it. The part that moved. Roan 
decided, must be the mouth. 

“My form shocks you,” the voice 
said. “It is because my energy level 
is so low. But how did you come 
here? Where are my people?” 

Roan made his voice sound. “You 
are the first Niss I’ve ever seen.” 

“I am Over-great-one Thstt, Com- 
mandei of Twelve Hordes. The 
alarm energized my forebrain and I 
came awake, here, in the stink of 
loneliness. I called, but none an- 
swer. Only you, Terran.” 

“I’ve waited years for this,” Roan 
said. “I always thought it would be 
very satisfying to kill a Niss. But 
now I don’t seem to care.” 

“Did the armies of Terra arise 



116 



IF 




then and destroy us? I see our 
dreadnaughts all in station, orbiting 
the enemy home-world. But no one 
answers my signals. And when I 
tried to call my home planet, I got 
only . listen.” 

The Niss floated out a portion of 
his polyoid body, threw a switch. 
“Listen!” 

Roan could hear nothing. But out 
of the receiver came a swirl of pur- 
ple smoke. No. Not purple. Some 
inconceivable color. It writhed into 
the room and disappeared without 
dispersing. 

T hstt screamed, and his scream 
turned finally into a smoke of 
the same color as that coming out 
of the receiver. The Niss’ odd, form- 
less body twisted and swelled, pul- 
sating and then shrank, slacker than 
before. 

Roan stepped over, switched off 
the microphone. “1 don’t know what 
that means,” he said in a shaken 
voice. 

“It’s the sound of desolation,” 
Thstt said. “Don’t you see? There is 
no one left but me. We had planned 
to seize your Galaxy because our 
own was infected with a parasite that 
consumed Niss vital energies. But 
we have lost.' And so we died — all 
but me, waiting here in alert sta- 
tis . .” 

“The Niss were never conquered,” 
Roan said. “They just disappeared, 
as far as anyone knows. And the 
machinery has run down, over the 
eons.” 

“And so I, too, die,” said Thstt. 
“And with me the ancient and 
mighty dream that was the race of 



Niss. But do not shoot me, or I will 
implode and you, too, will die. There 
is no need to watch me. It is not 
pleasant. We Niss are strong, and 
strong is our hold on that mystery 
we know as life . .” 

But Roan did watch. The polyoid 
body first grew, expanding as high 
as the ceiling and half as wide as 
the room, exchanging an -alien rush 
of terrifying colors within itself. 
Fascinated, Roan found himself hyp- 
notized by the horror of the colors 
and by something else, as though the 
death agonies of this alien were be- 
ing breathed into his own nostrils, 
stuffed into his own ears, touching 
nerve endings . 

Thstt began to shrink now, the 
colors becoming denser and slower 
and coagulating into painful scabs. 
Roan felt himself grasping painfully 
for breath and his mind reeled at 
the horror he felt. 

Then, suddenly, it was over. Roan 
let out his breath in a long sigh. He 
went to the crumpled polyon on the 
floor, and when he picked up the 
shrunken, pathetic thing, something 
clanked inside of it, like bones. 

“Gee, Boss,” Sidis spoke for the 
first time. 

Askor wiped his face with a horny 
hand. “Let’s get out of here. Chief.” 

Roan nodded, silently and turned 
away, feeling a strange loneliness, 
as though a part of his life had died. 

E ven from a hundred miles up it 
was beautiful. At twenty miles 
the night side was misted with lights 
and the day side was a soft har- 
mony of blue and green and russet. 
Roan could feel the leap of his 



EARTHBLOOD 



117 




heart, the shine in his eyes. Terra. 
Home. If only Henry Dread could 
have seen it like this. 

Roan dropped deeper into atmo- 
sphere, and his men leaned close, 
scanning the scene on the high mag 
screen. 

“Look, Boss,” Sidis pointed. 
“They’re coming up to meet us. May- 
be we better arm a couple batteries.” 

Roan watched the atmosphere 
planes, flashing their wings in the 
sun, far below. 

“They’re coming to meet us, as 
you said,” Roan pointed out. “Not 
to shoot at us.” 

A jet flyer barreled past, rolled 
like a playful fish, then shot away 
toward the west. 

“Hey!” Askor was studying the 
charts and comparing them with the 
screens. “That there is American- 
ada. Only it’s upside down.” 

Sidis keyed the communicator and 
called, for the twentieth time. There 
was no answer. The jet was back, 
circling, then streaking away again. 

“He wants us to follow,” Roan 
said. He altered course, trailed the 
tiny ship. It led them over a daz- 
zling blue and green coastline, across 
green hills, over a sprawling city, 
down to a wide paved field as white 
as beach sand. Roan lowered the 
ship carefully so as not to disturb 
the wide bands of colored plants 
massed beside the ramp. The ship 
grounded gently, and the rumble of 
the drive died. 

Roan stood, feeling his mouth 
dry, his knees trembling slightly. It 
wasn’t like fear. It was more like 
the feeling he’d had the first time 
he saw Stellaraire: Wanting her, and 



afraid that somehow he’d do some 
small thing wrong, and lose her. 
Askor was buckling on his guns. 
“Leave ’em here,” Roan said. 
“This is home. You don’t need your 
gun at home.” 

“Us Gooks got no home, Cap’n,” 
Sidis said. “But maybe we can pre- 
tend.” 

Roan took a deep breath. “May- 
be we’ll all have to pretend a little,” 
he said. 

XXXVI 

T hey descended from the ship into 
a world flashing with sunlight. 
Beyond the flower beds were trees 
that fluttered silver when the wind 
blew, and the air smelled of a thou- 
sand perfumes. It was so familiar to 
Roan’s dreams that tears came to 
his eyes. 

“Where’s all the Terries?” Sidis 
wondered aloud. 

Faint but pervasive, as though 
sounded by the motion of the air, 
came a gentle music. 

“Come on.” Roan led the way 
across the glass-white concrete, past 
Terran planes, blind and closed, past 
a row of empty, bright-colored bug- 
gies, used no doubt to convey pas- 
sengers from the long-range planes 
to the building ahead where helicop- 
ters waited on the roof. 

There was a wide, color-tiled walk 
between whispering, silver - leafed 
trees. Roan followed it and bumped 
into the door before he saw it. It 
was absolutely translucent glass, as 
was the wall. Only a faint line show- 
ed where the glass door joined the 
glass wall, and beyond it was a gar- 



118 



IF 




den of thin-petalled flowers. Within 
he could see solid panels, walling off 
rooms, and more flowers and 
streams and fountains. 

But no people. 

Roan thought for a panicked mo- 
ment of Aldo Cerise, of the beauti- 
ful, sad, dead city and the woman 
who was only a statue. But no. There 
were obviously people here. People? 
Could it be that the Niss had taken 
it over, that there were now only 
Niss? 

He pushed at the door, but it 
didn’t open and there wasn’t a han- 
dle. 

He heard running steps and 
through the trees came a child, a 
human child, and after the child a 
large white animal that Roan rec- 
ognized as a dog, from the picture- 
book he’d seen as a child. 

“Paulikins! Paulikins!” called the 
dog, and then barked wildly, seeing 
them. 

The child stopped before Roan, 
rocking a little after the run. He 
stared mercilessly, a beautiful pink 
and gold child with round blue eyes. 

The dog ran up, panting, and 
cringed with his tail between his 
legs. “It’s only a child, sirs,” he 
said and trembled all over. “A 
youngling. 1 don’t know how he got 
loose.” 

“It isn’t old Niss,” the child said. 
“It’s just a funny man. Look at his 
funny hands. See, Talbot?” 

“Of course we’re not Niss,” Roan 
said, and patted the child on the 
head. “We’re human, like you.” 

Talbot was sniffing the air, and 
edged closer, trying to sniff at Roan 
without seeming to. His eyes rolled 



to take in Sidis and Askor, standing 
silently by. 

“Is it a Mama or a Daddy?” Rob- 
ert asked. “It smeUs funny.” 

“There’s been a mistake, sir,” Tal- 
bot said. He had lost his fear and sat 
on his hunches, looking serious. He 
was a big woolly white dog, -spot- 
lessly clean, and Roan could imag- 
ine that Paulikins rode -on his back 
and afterwards curled up on the 
grass and rested his head on his 
furry stomach. 

“I see,” Roan said. “We landed 
in a spaceship and naturally every- 
one would think we were Niss.” 

“If you could wait here a mo- 
ment, sir, I’ll inform the Culture 
Authorities. You see, they’re fetch- 
ing a Niss scholar. They didn’t want 
anyone else to greet you.” 

“We’ll wait,” said Roan. 

A helicopter hesitated and lighted 
easily as a fly on the roof. As- 
kor and Sidis got up from where 
they had been sitting under a tree, 
smelling flowers they had picked. 
Roan was pacing under the trees, 
practicing Terran in his mind. The 
dog’s accent had been smoother, 
much more precise than his own. 
Many of the words Roan had had 
to strain or guess at. Also, there was 
a rising inflection that Roan’s lan- 
guage lacked. 

The woolly dog was back and 
made a deferential noise in the back 
of its throat. “If you would come 
this way. Sir, so that you can be 
properly received.” 

Roan turned to follow the dog 
and Askor and Sidis fell in beside 
him. He waved them back.

“You two wait here,” he said. “I’ll 
handle this.” 

“How come, Chief?” Askor 
frowned. “Up to now we always 
stuck together.” 

“I don’t need a bodyguard here,” 
Roan said. “And I don’t want the 
sight of you two to scare anybody. 
Just stand by.” 

The glass door opened silently at 
a touch. Roan followed the dog into 
a paneled-off room which looked as 
translucent from the inside as the 
glass door had looked from the out- 
side. The room was planted with a 
lush, green lawn that sprang softly 
under his feet. A breeze blew through 
the room, thou^ there were no 
openings in the one-way glass. 

A door slid open soundlessly 
across the spacious room, and a 
handsome young woman — no, a 
handsome young Man with bright 
brown hair that curled aroimd his 
head like a cap stepped through and 
smiled. A dog followed, silent and 
watchful. 

“I am Daryl Raim, the Niss ex- 
pert,” the Man said. His voice was 
low and controlled, as though he 
tuned each phrase before he spoke 
it. Roan felt his face looking angry. 

“I’m no Niss,” he said in a voice 
that sounded harsher than he intend- 
ed. I’m a Man.” 

“Of course. I‘see you are not Old 
Niss.” 

When ^ Daryl smiled, a dimple 
broke in the smooth, white skin of 
his left cheek. Roan found himself 
for the first time a mixture of em- 
barrassing emotions and to his hor- 
ror, he blushed. There was some- 
thing feminine and appealing about 

120 



the dimple, and the smooth white 
skin glowed as though it wanted to 
be touched. 

Daryl sat down gracefully, mo- 
tioned Roan to a chair entwined 
with trumpet-vines. 

“I . .” Roan didn’t know how to 
begin. How to explain who he was. 
“I am a Terran,” he said finally. 

Daryl nodded, smiling encourag- 
ingly. Roan felt foolish. Always be- 
fore, “I am a Terran,” had been an 
impressive thing to say. 

“Of course,” Daryl said. “I as- 
sume you have some important mes- 
sage from Old Niss?” 

Roan’s mouth opened and closed. 
His face hardened. “No,” he snap- 
ped. “I’m a Terran, coming home. 
The Niss are dead.” 

t4/^h?” Daryl’s voice was uncer- 
tain. “Dead? I’m sure this 
news will interest many people. But 
if you’re not from Old Niss . .?” 

“I was born on Tambool, out in 
the Eastern Arm,” Roan said. “Out 
there, Terra is a legend. I came here 
to see if it was real.” 

Daryl smiled apologetically. “Geo- 
graphy was never a hobby of mine.” 
“Tambool is another world. It’s 
half a lifetime away. Its sun is so 
far away you can’t even see it in the 
sky from here.” 

Daryl smiled uneasily. “You’ve 
come from Beyond? You’ve really 
. returned from the dead?” 

“Who said anything about the 
dead?” 

“I can’t believe it.” Daryl seemed 
to be talking to himself now. “But 
you do look — and your ship is like 
— and — and I’ve seen your face 



IF 




before — somewhere!” He finished 
up with his voice almost on a note 
of fright. Roan thought he shudder- 
ed — but the smile never left Dar- 
yl’s face. He held out his arm. 
“Lxx)k. Goosebumps!” 

Roan got to his feet. The chair 
was too comfortable, the conversa- 
tion too unreal. He looked around at 
the perfect lawn, the perfect invisi- 
bility of the walls, the perfumed and 
curled Man, 

“Don’t you realize what this 
means? The Niss blockade is over. 
Terra’s an open world again!” 

Daryl took out a thin golden cyl- 
inder, drew on it, blew out pink 
smoke through delicate nostrils. He 
rearranged his body with a subtle 
excitement. 

“I haven’t felt such a thrill in 
years,” he said. “I half believe you 
really did come back from Be- 
yond.” He stood, a smooth, flow- 
ing motion. “I want you to come 
with me, talk to me. I promise you 
such a night as you’ve never ex- 
perienced on either side of the grave. 
My equipage is waiting. Come along 
to my place.” He put a slender hand 
on Roan’s arm. Roan knocked it 
away. 

“Just tell me where to find your 
military leaders,” he said harshly. 
He pushed past Daryl, who shrank 
back, his painted eyes wide. Roan 
groped, looking for the door. He 
slammed against the invisible wall, 
cursed, felt his way along it, banged 
his knee at an invisible corner. He 
whirled on Daryl. 

“Get me out of here!” He roar- 
ed. “Where in the Nine Hells are 
the people who ought to be out here 



to hear what I have to tell them!” 

Daryl huddled against his dhair; 
Roan stared at him, feeling the an- 
ger drain away as suddenly as it had 
come. 

“Listen — Daryl,” he said, forcing 
his voice low. “I grew up amcmg 
aliens, fought my way through aliens 
to come here. I’ve gotten what I’ve 
had out of life by force, by guile, 
by killing. Those are my methods — 
the way you survive on the worlds 
out there.” Roan rammed spread 
fingers at the sky, accusing the 
worlds, accounting for himself. “I’m 
sorry if I hurt you,” he finished. 

Daryl smiled through glistening 
tears. He rose, all assurance again, 
touched his hair. 

“You’re quite wonderful,” he said. 
“And of course you’ll want to meet 
— oh, ever so many fascinating peo- 
ple.” 

“The place looks deserted,” Roan 
said. “Where is everybody?” 

“They’re a little shy. You under- 
stand. We weren’t just sure about 
Old Niss.” 

“You didn’t seem to be afraid of 
me — at first,” Roan said bluntly. 

“Afraid? Oh, I see what you mean. 
No, of course I wasn’t afraid. The 
restrainers are focused on you.” 

4 a restrainer?” Roan 

▼ ^ said in a tight voice. 

Daryl giggled. “They’re trained on 
your two — associates, too,” he said. 
“Shall I give you a demonstration?” 

“No!” Roan looked out across 
the flowerbeds beyond the glass. As- 
kor and Sidis were standing togeth- 
er, squinting up at the strange blue 
sky of Terra.

“We need a place to stay,” he 
said. He was looking around the 
room now, trying to pick out some- 
thing that looked like a restrainer. 

“Oh, you’ll find many charming 
compositions to choose from,” Dar- 
yle said. “But why don’t you accept 
my invitation? It would be such a 
coup to have you all to myself this 
first evening.” 

“What about my friends?” Roan 
demanded. 

Daryl arched his neck gracefully 
to look at them. “Such strange look- 
ing, er, persons,” he said, “If you 
don’t mind my saying so.” 

“Why should I mind?” Roan 
snapped. “It’s true enough, I guess. 
But there are a lot stranger, out 
there.” He waved at the sky. 

“They’ll be quartered wherever 
you choose,” Daryl said stiffly. “So 
long as you’re sure they’re not . 
Lowers . .” 

Roan rounded on him. “No, damn 
you! They’re my friends!” And he 
hated the reluctance he felt in claim- 
ing them. 

Daryl frowned. “Your manner is 
somewhat abrupt,” he said stiffly. 

“Too bad about my manfters,” 
Roan snapped. 

“But I suppose you forget such 
things. Beyond.” Daryl led the way 
out through panels that opened be- 
fore he touched them to the accom- 
paniment of musical tones that shim- 
mered in the air like soap bubbles. 
Outside, Roan beckoned Askor and 
Sidis over. 

“This is Daryl,” he said. “He’s fix- 
ing us up with a place to stay.” 

“Boss, did you say he?'* Sidis 
grinned. 



But Roan was staring at the heavy- 
maned, two-legged animals that pull- 
ed the open chariot. The chariot it- 
self was a work of ai*t — a series of 
airy, fluted colmuns that supported 
a latticed roof. The columns were 
gold and the latticed roof seemed 
to be of glass or a plastic and chang- 
ed color constantly, always glittering. 
The chariot had large wheels of 
gold, spoked with the same glitter- 
ing lattice work, whose convolutions 
suggested . something like the 
forms of half remembered dreams. 
And Roan would have stood puz- 
zling over the lattice, except that his 
eyes kept going back to the heavy- 
maned draught animals . 

“They’re Men!” he cried sudden- 
ly, watching the dog adjusting their 
harness neatly. “Terrans, pulling 
your chariot!” 

“Only Lowers,” said Daryl. “You 
wouldn’t have dogs do it? My char- 
ioteers are very well treated. Come, 
give them a sweet and see how happy 
they are.” He smiled benignly, went 
over and took something from the 
pouch at his waist. 

Roan watched, feeling something 
in his heart rip. Terrans! The magic 
that word had been, all across the 
universe. Askor and Sidis gaped, 
mouths open. 

Daryl handed a square, white bit 
of food to one of the hairy Terrans. 
“Here, Lenny. Good boy.” 

L enny took the candy and popped 
it into his mouth, then grinned 
happily. “Good, Master!” He almost 
jerked the chariot over as he got 
down to kiss Daryl’s sandaled foot. 
“Now, now, Lenny,” Daryl re-

IF 




proved softly. “Such a good boy,” 
he said, turning to Roan. “Would 
you like to give the other candy to 
Benny?” 

“No, damn you!” Roan roared. 
“I’d . .” and then stopped in shock 
when Benny — the other draught- 
human — burst into tears. 

Daryl started to say something to 
Roan, sighed, and gave Benny the 
candy himself. “Roan is not familiar 
with our customs,” he told Benny, 
patting him on the shoulder. “Good 
Benny. We all love Benny. Benny 
is pretty. Roan, could you tell Ben- 
ny he’s pretty?” 

Roan bit his lip. Benny looked at 
him in agony, holding the sweet and 
too upset to eat it. Benny had wide, 
innocent eyes that went oddly with 
his square beard and intricately plait- 
ed mane. 

“Benny is pretty,” Roan choked 
out. Lenny was watching, looking 
confused and frightened. 

“The slaves on Alpha Two at least 
hated being slaves,” Roan said. “And 
they weren’t even human.” 

“Hmmm,” Daryl mused. “You 
feel that because Benny and Lenny 
have the same basic form as you 
that they should be in all ways the 
same as you? Whereas if they were 
a different Shape . .?” 

“I don’t know,” Roan cut him 
off. He avoided the eyes of Askor 
and Sidis. “Come on, load up,” he 
snapped. 

“In this play-pretty?” Sidis growl- 
ed. 

“Unless you want to walk!” 

“Yeah,” Askor said. “We’ll walk.” 

“I guess we can walk as fast as 
Benny,” Sidis said. 



“And Lenny,” Askor added. 
‘Then walk.” 

The cart moved off. 

“You’ll need a dog, of course. I’ll 
see to it as soon as I have you situ- 
ated. You’ll have time for a bath 
and a nap.” Daryl gaily flicked the 
flower decked reins over the broad 
tan backs. “And then — but you’ll 
see for yourself — tonigiht!” 

XXXVII 

R oan woke in utter darkness, and 
his sleep had been so deep it 
was still heavy on him, like a weight 
of blankets. For a moment he stain- 
ed his ears for noise, hearing only 
the silence that crowded his own 
heartbeat into his ears. 

Then he remembered. He was on 
Terra, in a room like a garden with 
flowers, high in a glassy tower. In 
the darkness, a breeze was blowing 
from somewhere and it smelled like 
a drowsy afternoon. 

Then suddenly the darkness light- 
ened and Roan looked up to see a 
large, short-haired brown dog which 
nodded pK>litely. 

“Good evening. Master. I am Sos<^ 
telle. I am to be your dog — if you 
approve, sir.” 

Roan grunted, sat up. “My dog,” 
he said. He had never owned a liv- 
ing creature before. 

“I’m sorry to have disturbed you. 
Master — but Master Daryl was em- 
phatic about the party.” 

“That’s all right. I’m hungry. Can 
you get me something to eat?” 
Sostelle moved gracefully on his 
over-long hind legs, trotted to the 
wall, pushed a button, and a tray of 



EARTHBLOOD 



123 




hot, glazed fruit came out. He pull- 
ed the legs down on the tray and 
rolled it over to Roan, pulling up a 
chair for Roan to sit on. He had 
hands like a Man’s. 

“Is this all there is?” Roan asked. 

“It’s usual,” Sostelle said. “But 
I’ll get you something else, if you 
wish.” 

“How about meat and eggs?” 

“Dog food?” Sostelle looked as 
though he didn’t know whether to 
frown or laugh. 

“I can’t live on candy,” Roan said. 

“I’ll do my best, Master,” Sostelle 
said. “Cutlets in Sun Wine and 
pheasant eggs Metropole?” 

“Okay,” Roan said. “Anything.” 

“And shall I prepare a bath. 
Master?” 

“I had one yesterday,” Roan snap- 
ped. 

“Still — it’s customary . .” 

“All right.” Roan looked at the 
dog. “I’m pretty ignorant, Sostelle. 
Thanks for trying to help me.” 

Sostelle’s tongue came out in a 
canine smile. “I am sure that you 
will be a great master. I sense it. If 
you’ll forgive a dog’s foolish fancy, 
Sir.” 

“Keep me from looking like an 
idiot in front of these pretty crea- 
tures and I’ll forgive you anything.” 

T he fete was held in a vast, silver- 
and-glass walled space where 
fragile columns as slender as reeds 
ran up to arch out and meet in a 
glitter of jeweled-glass panels high 
overhead. The floor was a polished 
expanse of deep violet glass. The 
music was as stirring and as lovely 
as a flight of swans, as martial as 



the roar of lions, as gay as carnival. 

To Roan’s left and behind him, 
Sostelle stood in his stiff formal 
jacket, quite graceful on his hind 
legs, and whispered. “Hold your 
glass with one finger. Master, not 
with your whole hand.” 

Roan nodded, feeling awkward 
and almost naked, for Sostelle had 
depilated him and dressed him in a 
silky, green and gold garment that 
folded and tied together and felt as 
though it might fall off if you moved 
too quickly in it. The guests care- 
fully avoided staring at him. Sostelle 
pointed them out as they whirled 
past, their dance a dainty posturing 
in which neither partner touched 
even the fingertips of the other. 

Roan watched, overwhelmed by 
the blaze of light, of color, of move- 
ment across the vast expanse of mul- 
titiered glass-clear floor that made 
the throng of fancifully gowned men 
and women appear to be floating 
in the air. He finished the drink 
and another was there at once. Daryl 
appeared, transformed in a pink gar- 
ment, silver-dyed hair, and feathery 
wings attached to his ankles. 

“Roan — how marvelous you 
look.” He glanced at Sostelle. 

“And Sostelle — didn’t he offer 
you a choice of hair tints and scents? 
And what about decorative touch- 
es.” 

“He offered them,” Roan cut in. 
“I didn’t want them. Look, Daryl, 
I can’t afford to waste any more 
time. When will I meet your govern- 
mental leaders, your military men?” 

A small crowd was gathering in 
Daryl’s wake, watching Roan cu- 
riously. Someone tittered. 



124 



IF 




“Waste time?” Daryl’s nose got a 
pinched look. 

“I seem to have offended every- 
body again,” Roan said in the si- 
lence. “Didn’t you warn them I’d 
forgotten my manners?” 

A nervous laugh went through the 
group. 

“Is that what it means to you?” 
he almost shouted. “Manners? Don’t 
you care that Terra’s a free world 
again — that the Galaxy is open to 
you?” 

Daryl put a hand on his arm. “No 
one here is much on mythology. 
Roan. They — ” 

“Mythology, Hell! I’m talking 
about a thousand worlds — a million 
of them — and once Terra ruled 
them all!” 

A ripple of applause broke out. 

Daryl joined in. “Oharming,” he 
said “So spontaneous.” He flicked 
his eyes at the others. “Roan’s going 
to be wonderful,” he said. 

A girl was looking at Roan. If she 
had been done by a bad artist in 
brass, she would have looked like 
Stellaraire. She was the statue in the 
garden on Aldo Cerise, but her body 
was warm human flesh instead of 
cold stone, and her mouth by its 
very existence begged to be kissed. 
She had smiled when the others 
laughed. Her lips barely curved but 
her green eyes seemed to tilt up at 
the corners. 

“I’m Desiranne,” she said. “I 
don’t understand what you’ve said 
— but it’s exciting.” 

“Desiranne will entertain tonight,” 
Daryl said. “It will be die high point 
of the evening.” His eyes moved 
over her like a lecherous hand. 



44T ook,” Roan said to the girl. 

A-/ “It’s nice about the party 
and you’re so beautiful a nmn almost 
can’t endure it, but someone’s got 
to listen to me. This is the biggest 
thing that’s happened to Terra in 
five thousand years. But before long 
the ITN is going to realize the 
blockade is over. There’s a fdlow 
named Trishinist who’d give his hair 
to be the one to lead a’n invading 
force in here. They think of Terra 
as one big treasure house, ripe for 
looting — the richest prize of all.” 

Daryl laughed with a mouth full 
of smoke and ended up choking. 
Sostelle came immediately with a 
glass of water and a scented, gos- 
samer tissue. People were turning 
away, already looking bored. 

Daryl smiled knowingly, took out 
a cigarette. “I wouldn’t,” he said. 
“Not so soon. I’m sure you’ll become 
a great Favorite, but if you tiy to 
push yourself forward right away, 
people will resent it.” 

Roan growled and Daryl jumped. 
“Really,” he said almost sharply. 
“You’ll have to learn a few of the 
graces. And I’d also suggest you let 
your fingernails grow out a bit more 
gracefully and a few things like that 
which Sostelle will advise you 
about.” He rose in a smooth ballet 
movement. 

“And now, I think Desiranne and 
I—” 

“She’ll dance with me,” Roan said 
roughly. He finished his wine with a 
gulp, tossed the glass aside, walked 
past Daryl to the girl’s side. She 
looked around, wide-eyed, as Roan 
took her in his arms. She was as 
light as a handful of moonbeams, 



EARTHBLOOD 



125 




Roan found himself thinking, sud- 
denly struck dumb by her fragile 
loveliness. 

But there was no need for talk. He 
was suddenly aware of the music, 
swelling louder now. There was a 
deep, booming throb that matched 
the cadence of the human heart, and 
a dazzling interplay of horns that 
repeated the rhythms of the human 
nervous system, and an intricate mel- 
ody that echoed forgotten human 
dreams. Stellar aire had taught Roan 
how to dance, long ago; he had not 
forgotten. All around, the Terrans 
had drawn back. Now they stood, 
watching, as Roan responded with 
a lifetime’s pent-up emotion to the 
call of the music and the girl and 
the strong wine of Terra. 

And then the music ended on a 
fading susurration of cymbals and 
the high wail of brass. Roan swept 
Desiranne almost to the floor. For 
a moment he held her there, looking 
into her perfect, half-frightened, half- 
enraptured face. 

“I think I know now why I came 
here,” he said. “I think I knew I’d 
find you. Now I don’t think I’ll ever 
let you go.” 

Tliere were sudden tears in her 
eyes as Roan set her on her feet. 
“Roan,” she whispered. “Why didn’t 
you come sooner?” 

Then she turned and fled. 

S uddenly there was deafening ap- 
plause. Shouts of bravo! and 
splendid! rang out. Everyone seemed 
to be staring at him with eyes that 
were bright with . fear? 

They came toward him almost cau- 
tiously, as though approaching a 



tame beast, led by a small, lithe 
brunette with long hair done into 
such a complex system of plaits and 
curls that her head looked too heavy 
for her small body. She had a sin- 
uous, elongated walk, and her dress 
was the color of ... of air with 
sunshine in it. 

“Mistress Alouicia,” Sostelle whis- 
pered to Roan, “a dancer, and a 
very clever woman.” 

“Marvelous,” she said. “Such a 
spectacle of primitive savagery! For 
a moment I thought you were going 
to lose control and kill her, tear her 
throat out with those great strong 
teeth.” She shuddered, showing Roan 
a smile that was just a little long in 
the tooth. 

“I’d never understood ancient mu- 
sic before,” a man said. “Now I 
think I do.” 

“The way he sprang at her!” 
someone else offered. “And then 
putting his hands on her that way. 
It was intended to represent a tiger 
seizing his prey, wasn’t it?” 

“No, it was just a dance,” Roan 
said, and turned to Sostelle and ask- 
ed in a loud voice, “It’s all right, 
isn’t it, to say what you mean instead 
of making people guess?” 

Sostelle, knowing this wasn’t to 
be answered, kept a discreet silence 
and straightened the folds in Roan’s 
chiton. 

“Does everyone dance in that way 
in your homeland?” Alouicia asked, 
smiling a bit stiffly now. 

“On every world there are differ- 
ent dances. Once I was with a circus 
and my girl did erotic dances in sev- 
eral different cultures.” 

“Erotic? How interesting.” 



126 



IF 




Roan Was glad to have found a 
subject of interest. He was feeling 
the wine, wanting to put everyone 
at ease, and then go find Desiranne. 

“It frequently led to public copu- 
lation,” he added. 

“To . to . what did you 
say?” Alouicia’s eyes widened. 

“What does it mean?” a high 
voice whispered loudly. 

Someone tittered. “Like Dogs. 
Imagine!” 

“Really! What sort of . animal 
. would perform such a dance?” 
“She was beautiful,” Roan said, 
remembering Stellaraire. and feeling 
that something should be said out 
of loyalty. “I loved her.” 

“He’s not merely a savage,” a 
voice said loudly behind him. ‘T do 
believe he’s a Lower.” 

Roan turned. A tall, wide-shoul- 
dered Terran stood looking at him 
with an expression of distaste. 

“Master Hugh, the famous ath- 
lete.” Sostelle murmured. 

“Hugh!” Alouicia said, her voice 
carrying the faintest edge of shrill- 
ness. “What an exciting confronta- 
tion! The strongest man on Terra, 
with your interest in the ancient 
athletic arts — and this . elemental 
man from — wherever he’s from!” 
“Please,” 'Daryl said, putting a 
hand on Roan’s arm. “I think — ” 
“Never mind,” Roan said. “I’m 
not very good at remembering all 
the things that are too ugly for you 
pretty people to talk about. I’m a 
man; I sweat and bleed and eat and 
excrete — ” 

“Roan!” Daryl said. Alouicia drew 
away with a small cry. Sostell gasp- 
ed. 



“Go away,” Hugh said. “I don’t 
know who brought you here. You’re 
not fit for the society of civilized 
people!” 

“There’s nothing civilized about 
the ITN,” Roan said. “What would 
you do if they showed up? If they 
came storming across those pretty 
gardens and in through the pretty 
door; what would you do?’’ 

“I’m sure that thirty thousand 
years of culture have prepared us 
to deal with whatever a barbarian 
might do,” Daryl said uneasily. 

Roan doubled a fist and held it 
before him. “Do you know what 
this is?” 

H ugh eyed the double knuckles. 

His nose wrinkled. “Of course. 
The dawn-men — Romans, I think 
they were called — had a primitive 
sport in which they flailed one an- 
other with their hands held in that 
way. This was done in a coliseum 
called Madison Square Garden, and 
the winner was awarded a fig-leaf, 
or something of the sort.” 

Roan drew back his fist and hit 
Hugh square on the nose, taking 
care not to put too much power 
back of the blow. Hugh went down, 
blood streaming down across his lip 
and into his mouth. He cried out, 
dabbed at his face, stared at the crim- 
soned fingers. There were little 
shrieks all around. 

“You bruter Hugh said. 

“All right,” Roan heard himself 
shouting. “What do you do, with 
your thirty thousand years of cul- 
ture?” 

Hugh came to his feet. All round, 
people stared, eyes bright, lips part-

ed. Roan stepped to Hugh and hit 
him solidly on the side of the jaw. 
Hugh fell down again, his mouth 
open and a look of utter amazement 
on his face. 

“You’re supposed to be an ath- 
lete,” Roan said. “Get up and fight 
back.” 

Hugh got to his feet. He folded 
his fingers over his palms and held 
them in front of him; then he step- 
ped up to Roan and struck out with 
an overhand blow. Roan casually 
brushed Hugh’s arm aside and hit 
him in the stomach. As Hugh dou- 
bled over. Roan planted a left and 
right to the face. Hugh sprawled on 
the floor and began to cry. 

Roan reached, caught his garment 
by the shoulder, hauled him half 
erect, slapped him across the cheek. 

“It may surprise you,” he said. 
“But members of an attacking army 
don’t stop when you cry. They just 
laugh at you. And they don’t fight 
nicely, like I do. If you’re on the 
floor — ” he let Hugh drop — “they 
kick you. Like this.” And he planted 
a solid blow in Hugh’s ribs with his 
toe. Hugh scrambled back, tears 
streaming down his face. He was 
sobbing loudly. 

“Get up!” Roan said. “Get mad! 
That’s the only thing that will stop 
me!” He followed Hugh, dragged 
him to his feet, hit him in the eye, 
then, holding him up, punched him 
in the mouth. Hugh’s face was a 
bloody mask now. 

“Fight!” Roan said. “Hit back!” 

Hugh broke away, stumbled back 
against the watching crowd. They 
thrust him back toward Roan. He 
saw their faces then, for the first 



time. They were like hungry char- 
ons, waiting for an old Gracyl to 
die. 

“Kill him, savage!” a man called. 
Saliva ran out of his mouth and 
down into his perfumed, pale blue 
beard. Alouicia held out her hands, 
the gold-enameled nails like raking 
claws. “Bite his throat!” she shrill- 
ed. “Drink his blood!” 

Roan dropped his hands, feeling a 
thrill of horror. Hugh broke through 
the ring and ran, sobbing: 

“Master,” Sostelle said. “Oh, 
Master . .” 

“Let’s go,” Roan said. “Where’s 
my crew?” He staggered, feeling the 
room tilt under his feet. Terran 
wine was made for Terran nervous 
systems; it hit hard. 

“Master, I don’t know. But — ” 

CtT^ind them!” Roan shouted. 

^ People scattered before him. 

He was out in the wide entry hall 
now. The polished black floor threw 
back reflections of chandeliers and 
of the stars above the glass-domed 
ceiling. Sostelle hurried ahead, 
bounding on all fours. Two tall, wide 
shapes stepped from the shadow of 
a slender supporting rib ahead, stood 
silhouetted against the sweep of 
glass front. 

“Askor,” Roan called. “Sidis!” 

“Yeah, Boss.” They came toward 
him. They were dressed in their 
soiled ship clothes. Sidis wore a 
pistol openly at his hip. 

“Thought I said ... no guns,” 
Roan said blurrily. 

“I had a hunch you might change 
your mind,” Sidis said. His teeth 
gleamed in the gloom. 



128 



IF 




“You did, eh?” Roan felt an un- 
reasoning anger rising in him. It 
was almost like joy. “Since when 
did you start doing my thinking for 
me?” He took a step, swung what 
should have been a smashing blow to 
the Minid’s head, but he missed, al- 
most fell. Sidis hadn’t moved. 

“Gee, Chief,” Askor said admir- 
ingly. “You’re drunk!” 

“I’m not drunk, damn you!” Roan 
planted his feet, breathing hard. 
“And what are you doing here in 
those rags? Why haven’t you washed 
your ugly faces? I can smell you 
from three yards away!” He could 
feel his tongue slurring over the 
words, and this made him angrier 
than ever. “You trying . ’sgrace 
me?” he roared. “Get out of here 
and don’t come back . till you 
look like human beings!” 



“That could be quite a while. 
Chief,” Askor said. “Look, Cap’n, 
let’s blow out of this place. It’s 
creepy. I can hardly keep my hands 
off these Terries of yours.” 

“They’re not mine,” Roan yelled. 
“And I’ll say when we leave!” 
“He’s right. Boss,” Sidis cut in. 
“This world ain’t good for us. LQt’s 
shove off, Cap’n. Just the three of 
us, like before.” 

“I’m Captain of the bloody men- 
agerie!” Roan yelled. “When I’m 
ready to lift ship. I’ll tell you. Now 
get out of my sight! Get lost!” 
“Master,” Sostelle whispered. 
“You, too, you freak,” Roan stag- 
gered, wiped a hand across his face. 
It was hot, feverish. Everything 
seemed to be spinning around him; 
his mind seemed to be floating free 
of his body, like a captive balloon.

Then skyrockets came shooting up 
in a fiery shower and when they 
shimmered away into darkness there 
was nothing . 

XXXVIII 

R oan sat up and looked around. 

Noise roared in his ears. A 
face swam mistily before him. 

“Ah, he’s awake!” someone call- 
ed. Someone else thrust a thin-stem- 
med glass into his hand. He drank 
thirstily, let the glass fall. Daryl was 
there, looking at him eagerly with 
painted eyes. 

“Roan! You looked so lovely sleep- 
ing, with your mouth open and 
sweat on your face.” 

“Where’s Desiranne?” Roan said. 
His head ached but he could speak 
clearly now. 

“Eh? Why she’s preparing for her 
performance, later in the evening — 
but — ” 

“I want to see her.” Roan stood 
and the table fell over. “Where is 
she?” 

“Now, Roan.” Daryl was at his 
side. “Just be patient. You’ll see 
her.” He laughed a high, tight laugh. 
“Oh, my, yes, you’ll see her. You 
liked her, didn’t you? You . you 
lusted after her?** 

Roan took Daryl by the shoulder, 
lifted him from the floor. “Keep 
away from me,” he snarled, and 
threw the Terran from him. His vi- 
sion seemed cloudy, as though the 
room were full of mist. There were 
other people around him, but their 
faces weren’t clear. Sostelle was 
there, his face worried and homely 
and familiar and dependable. 



“Where is she, Sostelle?” Roan 
said. “Where did she go?” 

“Master, I don’t know. This is not 
a matter for dogs.” His voice was 
almost a moan. 

“Sure, I liked her,” Roan said 
loudly. “I loved her!” He kicked a 
chair from his path, started across 
the floor. “She liked me, too, didn’t 
she?” He rounded on the dog. “Well, 
didn’t she?” 

Sostelle’s face assumed an unread- 
able canine expression^ “Her inter- 
est in you was unmistakable. Mas- 
ter.” 

“You think so?” 

“Certainly. She is a lovely lady. 
Master. Worthy of you.” But there 
was something about his tone; some- 
thing Roan didn’t understand. 

“I’ve got to find her. Can’t leave 
this mad house until I find her.” He 
started on. The people before him 
flitted backward, just out of reach, 
just out of vision. The noise was 
like an avalanche of sound — a wild, 
screaming sort of music that seemed 
to tell of great birds of prey swoop- 
ing to a feast. 

“T will help you. Master,” Sostelle 
said. “I will help you all I can.” 

“You’re a damned good dog, Sos- 
telle. Hell, you’re the only friend 
I’ve met here.” 

“Sir!” Sostelle sounded shocked. 
“It’s not done. Sir, to call a dog a 
friend.” 

Roan laughed harshly. “I guess 
I’ll never learn the rules, Sostelle. I 
came too late — for all of us.” 

“Master. Perhaps you should go 
now — and take me with you.” 

“You, too? What is it, a conspir- 
acy? I’ve told you, damn you. I’m

IF 




not going until I find her!” There 
was a table in his path and he kicked 
it savagely aside. 

“Roan, Roan,” a quavering voice 
called. He stopped, steadied himself 
against a table, peered through the 
mist. Daryl darted up to him, his 
carefully coiffured hair awry. A 
smile flicked on and off like leaf 
shadows playing on water. 

“It’s Desiranne you want to see. 
I promise you, you’ll see her. Just 
wait. But now come along with me. 
The party’s just begun. We have 
wonderful things planned, and we 
must have you! It will be the great- 
est affair of the century — of a life- 
time! And at the end — Desiranne!” 
“Sostelle, is he lying?” Roan star- 
ed at the Terran, who was quiver- 
ing with eagerness, like an Alphaa 
slave awaiting a kick or the dregs of 
a wineglass, not knowing which it 
would be. 

“Master,” Sostelle whined, “Mas- 
ter Daryl speaks the truth.” 

“Then I’ll come.” 

“You’ll be glad. Roan,” Daryl 
gushed. “So glad. And^ — ” 

“Never mind that. Where are we 
going?” 

“First, we’ll dine. After the danc- 
ing and the . excitement ... we 
need to nourish ourselves, don’t you 
think?” He giggled. “And then — 
but you’ll see. There will be marvel- 
ous things. All the pleasures of Terra 
are waiting for you tonight!” He 
danced away, calling to others. Roan 
started after him, then turned back 
to Sostelle with a quick thought. 

“Pleasure,” he said, “is what you 
go after when there isn’t anything 
else left.” 



T he cold night air cleared Roan’s 
head. He looked down from 
the open flyer in which he and Daryl 
and two women and their dogs sat 
on silken cushions, drinking from 
small, thin-necked bottles of spicy 
liquor. There were other airboats 
around them, darting in and out like 
a school of playful fish. Over the 
rush of air, thin cries of ex!citement 
mingled with the chatter of many 
voices talking at once. 

The dog piloting the craft drop- 
ped it to the tip of a tall spire of 
glowing yellow glass. Roan followed 
the others through an entry that 
looked like solid glass, but parted 
before him with a tinkle of cold 
crystals. Flushed, bright-eyed faces 
swarmed around him, but none of 
them were Desiranne. A tall girl 
with heavy golden hair came up to 
Roan, her bare arms ivory-white. She 
looked at him with her eyes half 
shut, her lips parted, her tongue 
showing. Roan showed his teeth and 
reached for her, and she shuddered 
and shrank back. Roan laughed and 
pushed through to follow Daryl. 

H e was trying hard to remember 
where the table was, how he 
had come there. He couldn’t. There 
had been so many tables, so much 
noise, so many of the little bottles 
of spicy wine. He felt very sober, 
though, and his mind seemed to be 
working unusually clearly. 

Neatly dressed dogs were serving 
food. Roan ate with voracious ap- 
petite while his companions nibbl^ 
and watched. Roan hardly noticed 
them. Once he looked up to see the 
blonde girl sitting across from him. 



EARTHBLOOD

“You Terries know how to make 
food,” he said. “This is better even 
than blood.” 

The girl — Phrygette, Roan re- 
membered her name — looked sick 
and excited at the same time. She 
put out her hand as though to touch 
the hair on Roan’s arm, then drew 
it back. 

“You’re strange,” she whispered. 
“I wonder what you think about.” 

“I think about many things,” Roan 
said carefully, wishing the hot feel- 
ing and the humming in his ears 
would go away. “I think about the 
Niss, and how Man killed himself 
fighting them, and how they died 
alone, then, and how their ghosts 
haunted the Galaxy for five thou- 
sand years.” 

“Old Niss,” Phrygette said, boldly 
touching Roan’s arm now. “I always 
thought he was a silly superstition.” 

“I did a terrible thing when I ran 
the Niss blockade.” Roan said. “I 
didn’t free Terra. I shattered the 
myth that had held the universe out 
for five thousand years. Now she’s 
exposed to the sharks: Trishinist, 
and after him, others, until Terra is 
no different than Tambool.” 

Phrygette was looking around for 
her dog, Ylep, to come and fix her 
make-up. 

“A new navy, that’s what you 
need,” Roan said. “Trishinist can 
muster fifty thousand men, and he 
has the ships to transport them. 
You have ships, too — underground, 
waiting. You need to issue weapons 
and learn how to use them, prepare 
tactics to meet an enemy landing 
party.” 

Phrygette frowned at Roan. “Real- 



ly, for someone from Beyond, you 
talk about the strangest things. Tell 
me how it feels to kill someone. 
Roan. Tell me how it feels to die.” 

“You’ll find out soon enough,” 
Roan said roughly. 

Suddenly he felt very bad. His 
heart was trying to climb up his 
throat, and his head hurt terribly. 
He swallowed more wine, put his 
head down on the table. Phrygette 
got to her feet, wrinkling her nose. 

“I’m afraid he’s becoming a bore,” 
she said to someone. “Let’s go on 
to the theater, Daryl. They’ve prob- 
ably already started — without us!” 

“They wouldn’t dare!” Daryl said, 
sounding alarmed. “Not after / 
plapned it!” 

“They might.” 

“Roan!” Daryl was shaking him. 
He raised his head and saw a crowd 
all around him, faces staring out of 
a blackish haze. 

“Come on. Roan!” It was Daryl, 
catching at his hand. “You went to 
sleep again, you foolish boy, but 
now we’re all ready to go to the 
Museum!” 

“Go where?” 

“To the Museum of the Glory of 
Man! Come on! Oh, you’ll be thrill- 
ed, Roan! It’s an ancient, ancient 
place — just at the edge of the 
Lower Town. All sort of shuddery 
and dim — but marvelous, really! It’s 
all there — all Terra’s history. We’ve 
been saving it for a special occa- 
sion — and this is certainly the per- 
fect night!” 

“Funny place ... for a party . .” 
Roan said, but he got to his feet 
and followed the laughing, chatter- 
ing crowd. 



132 



IF 




O ut on the roof, the dogs jumped 
up, handing their masters and 
mistresses to their places in the 
waiting flyers, some of which hov- 
ered, waiting their turn. Roan felt 
as though he were moving in a 
dream imbued with a sense of ter- 
rible impending. The dogs’ eyes 
looked wide, afraid. Even Sostelle 
was awkward, getting the flyer’s 
door open. Roan’s hand went to his 
belt, feeling for a gun that wasn’t 
there. 

“Askor,” he said suddenly. “And 
Sidis. Where are they?” He half 
rose, sat down suddenly as the fly- 
er jumped forward. 

“They’ll trouble you no more,” 
Daryl said. “And now. Roan, just 
think! Objects that were held sacred 
by our ancestors, five thousand — 
ten thousand years ago — ” 

“What do you mean,” Roan said, 
feeling tightness in his chest. “Where 
are they?” 

“Roan — don’t you remember? 
You sent them away yourself.” 
“Sostelle!” Roan felt a sudden 
weakness as he tried again to rise. 
Blackness whirled in, shot with fire. 

“Master, it is true. You ordered 
them to leave you. They laid hands 
on you, to drag you with them, 
but you fought, and then . then 
Master Daryl was impelled to . 
to call for the Enforcers.” 

“What are they?” Roan heard his 
own hoarse voice as from a great 
distance. 

“Specially trained dogs. Master,” 
Sostelle said in a tight voice. “Led 
by Kotsohai the Punisher.” 

“Are they — did they — ?” 

“Your companions fought might- 



ily Master. They killed many dogs. 
At last they were overwhelmed, and 
restrainers were focused on them. 
Then they were taken away.” 

“Then they’re alive?” The black- 
ness broke, flushed away. 

“Of course. Master!” Sostelle 
sounded shocked. 

Roan laughed harshly. “Tliey’re 
all right, then. They’ve bfeen in jail 
before. I’ll bail ’em out in the morn- 
ing.” 

T hey had landed on the wide 
roof of an ancient palace. Roan 
tottered, felt Sostelle’s hand under 
his elbow. 

“I’m sick,” he said. “I’ve never 
been sick, since I was burned when 
Henry Dread shelled the Extrava- 
ganzoo. There was a Man doctor 
there; he cured me. He couldn’t 
cure Stellar aire, though. She was 
crushed by a cromalloy beam, and 
then . , burned ...” 

• “Yes, Master,” Sostelle soothed. 

“Gom Bulj died from the ac- 
celeration. But I killed Ycth. And 
I killed Henry Dread, too. You 
didn’t know that, did you Sostelle? 
But Iron Robert — he died for 
me .... 

They were inside now. The voices 
of the others were like birds quarrel- 
ing over a dung heap. Their faces 
were blurred, vague. All around, 
tall cases were ranged, faced with 
glass. Someone was talking urgently 
to Roan, but he ignored him, walked 
to the nearest display, feeling as 
though he were toiling up a hill. 

“This is a collection of famous 
jewel stones. Master,” Sostelle was 
saying. “All natural minerals, found 



EARTHBLOOD 



133 




here on Terra, and treasured by 
Men for their beauty and rarity.” 

Roan stared down at rank on rank 
of glittering, faceted crystals — red, 
green, blue, violet, clear white. 

“There is the Napoleon emerald,” 
Sostelle said. “Worn by an ancient 
war-chief. And beyond is the Bud- 
dha’s Heart ruby, once the object 
of veneration of five billion wor- 
shippers. And there, just beyond — 
the Iceberg diamond, said to be the 
largest and finest ever found in 
Antarctica.” 

“Look, Roan,” Daryl called. 
“These are called monies. They’re 
made of solid natural gold, and in 
early times they were traded back 
and forth in exchange for oh, other 
things,” he finished vaguely. “Rather 
a bore, really. Come along to the 
next room, though. There are some 
fabulous things . 

Roan followed, stared at looming 
walls decorated with objects as bar- 
oque and primitive as the crude 
weapons of the wild men on Aldo 
Cerise, others of a powerful, bar- 
baric beauty, and still others of a 
glittering intricacy that his mind 
could not comprehend. There were 
more cases — miles of them, each 
glowing with is own soft light, each 
with its array of objects of metal, 
stone, wood, glass, fabric, synthe- 
tic. 

“Look!” Daryl was poking Roan. 
“Those clothes were made from 
fibers that grew from the dirt. They 
scraped them clean in some way, 
and then worked them all together, 
and colored them with — with fruit 
juices or something. Then they saw- 
ed out pieces and looped them to- 



gether with little strings. That was 
called sowing — ” 

“No, that was when they made 
the plants that they got the fibers 
from,” someone interrupted. “But 
aren’t they funny?” 

Roan gazed at the display of old 
uniforms. Some \yere shapeless and 
faded, brown with age, curled with 
time, even protected as they were 
by the vacuum of the display cas- 
es. Others, farther along, were more 
familiar. 

“You see those long, sharp things? 
They used those to stick into each 
other,” A high excited voice called. 
“And these odd-shaped objects made 
some sort of lightning and tore 
holes in people. There must have 
been a great deal of blood.” 

Roan stopped, staring at a tunic 
of brilliant blue, with narrow silvery- 
gray trousers, and a belt with a buc- 
kle bearing an eagle and the words 
Terran Space Forces, 

“It’s like the ITN uniform,” he 
said to no one. “But it was made 
before there was an empire . .” 
Daryl was beside Roan, his face 
puckered in thought. He looked 
up at Roan, his eyes snapping wide. 

“You!” he said in a strained 
voice. “I know where it was I saw 
your face. Look, everybody, come 
with me!” He turned, ran off. 

“What’s the matter with him?” 
Roan growled, but he followed. 

I n a small room off the main hall, 
a crowd clustered around a 
lighted case. They looked around 
as Roan came up, gave way, star- 
ing at him, silent now. Roan halted 
before the high glass panel, stared 



134 



IP 




at a hazy scene, bright lit. He 
blinked, cleared his vision. 

The figure of a man stood be- 
fore him, clad in a uniform like 
the one he had just seen, leaning 
against the flank of a ship of quaint, 
primitive design. The eyes, blue 
like cool fire, looked into Roan’s 
from across the centuries. The deep 
red hair was hacked short, but its 
stubborn curl still showed. A deep, 
recorded voice spoke from a slot 
beneath the display: 

“This was Vice-Admiral Stephen 
Murdoch, as he appeared in his last 
solido, taken only moments before 
he embarked on his last, heroic mis- 
sion. Admiral Murdoch is renowned 
as the hero of the Battle of Ceres 
and of the Siege of the Callistan 
Redoubts. He was lost in space in 
the year eleven thousand, four hun- 
dred and two of the Atomic Era.” 
“Master,” Sostelle said in the si- 
lence. “It’s you!” 

Roan turned, looked at Daryl. 
“How . ?” he started. He put 
his hands on himself as though to 
assure himself that he was Roan 
Cornay, alive here and now. But 
Daryl and the others stared back 
at him as though he was himself 
a thing from out of the remote 
past, like the figure in the case. 

Roan laughed suddenly, wildly. “I 
wanted to know who my father was,” 
he said. “But I never suspected he 
was sixteen thousand years old.” 
“He . really . is . .” 
Daryl said, and licked at his lips. He 
whirled to the others. “Don’t you 
understand? He really did come 
from Beyond, just as he said! He’s 
returned from the dead!” 



“No,” a loud voice said. It was 
Hugh, his face raw and cut from 
the beating Roan had given hkn. 
“He’s a dirty Lower, and 'he should 
be turned over to the dogs.” 

“He’s returned from the dead!” 
Daryl screeched. “Come along! It’s 
easy enough to prove!” - 

“The genetic analyzer!” someone 
called. “In the next hall ...” 
“Roan, this will show them all,” 
Daryl said breathlessly. There was 
a strange light in his eyes. “And 
then — you’ll tell me how it feels 
to be dead, and rise again!” 
“You’re insane, Daryl,” Roan 
said. “You’re all insane!” he shout- 
ed. “I’m the most insane of all, for 
being here, where I don’t belong!” 
He broke off. “Tomorrow,” he said. 
“Tomorrw I’ll leave here. With As- 
kor and Sidis. They’re my kind: I 
understand them. They’re not pretty, 
but they’ve got the beauty of reality 
about them . .” 

“And you’ll take me. Master?” 
Sostelle whispered. 

“Sure, Man’s best dog is his 
friend, eh?” Roan stumbled, almost 
fell. He was hardly aware of walk- 
ing, Sostelle at his side, Daryl trot- 
ting ahead, under a high arch with 
a flame burning under it in a metal 
tray, on into an even bigger room 
that echoed with the bat-like cries 
of the Terrans. 

“ . classify persons wishing to 
contribute to the germinal banks,” 
Daryl was saying. “Here in the Hall 
of Man, all the records were 
kept — ” 

“My genetic patterns won’t be 
here,” Roan said, almost clear- 
headed for the moment.

‘^He’s afraid,” Hugh said. “WiU 
he confess his pretensions now?” 

Roan looked around at gleam- 
ing equipment, towering metal pan- 
els, winking clinical lights. 

“Put your hand here, Roan,” 
Daryl urged. He indicated an open- 
ing, guided Roan’s hand to it. He 
felt a sharp tingle for an instant, 
nothing nK>re. 

There was a soft hum and a plas- 
tic tab extruded from a slot in the 
face of the genetic analyzer. Daryl 
snatched it, looked at it, then 
whirled to face the others. 

“It’s him! It’s Stephen Murdoch, 
returned from beyond the cremator- 
ium!” 

XXXIX 

H e didn’t remember again then; 

not until they were in a vasty 
room with ancient flags hanging 
from age-blackened rafters. 

“ . minster Hall,” an excited 
voice was saying. “Over thirty 
thousand years old. Think! Of the 
toil, the human tears and sweat ackl 
heartache that went into building 
this, so long ago, to preserving it 
down through the ages, to bring it 
here — for us!” The voice went on, 
excited, rapturous. 

“What’s it all about?” Roan 
asked. “What’s this old building? It 
looks like something on Tambool.” 
“It’s very ancient. Master,” Sos- 
telle said. Somewhere a bright light 
was flaring in the gloom. 

“ . took them so many ages 
to create, with all its traditions and 
memories — and we, us! Yes, in 
a single night! A single hour! We 

137 



can destroy it all. Thirty thousand 
years of human history end — 
now!” Roan watched as a slender 
man in flowing garments ran for- 
ward, applied the torch to the base 
of a hand^hewn cdunm. Fire lick- 
ed upward. In moments it had 
reached the faded pyennants; they 
disappeared into smoke. Fire ran 
across the high peaked ceiling. 
Voices shouted as the crowd pushed 
forward. Suddenly a woman whirled 
madly, striking out at those around 
her. They fell back yelping, and 
the frenzied girl tore at her gar- 
ment, stripped it off, threw it at 
the fire. Roan saw with a dull shock 
that there was no hair on her body. 

“Give me something sharp!” she 
screamed, then plunged, caught up 
a jagged fragment of smoking wood, 
scored it down the creamy white of 
her chest and stomach. Blood start- 
ed. The woman staggered back, 
wailed faintly, fell, and dogs start- 
ed forward, bore her away. 

“Get back!” Someone was call- 
ing. The ceiling was a mass of 
boiling smoke and flame. Each mas- 
sdve timber supporting the rafters 
blazed, crackling. Roan backed 
away, then turned and ran. 

Behind him, the roof fell with 
a great thunder. A blast of scald- 
ing air struck at him, and sparks 
flew all around . 

Later, he stood at the top of a 
broad flight of marble steps, where 
a group of men wheezed under the 
weight of a black stone statue of 
a man with a wide head-dress and 
a straight-ahead gaze. 

“See him. Roan?” Daryl called. 
“Isn’t he wonderful? The labor, the 



hopes that went into that image. 
And now ...” 

The Pharaoh Horem-heb went 
over with a resounding smash, tum- 
bled down head over throne, pulver- 
izing the steps as it struck them. 
The head flew off, struck a man 
standing below, who fell screaming, 
and a crowd closed around him like 
fish after a bait. 

“Master, you’re not well,” Sos- 
telle was saying. “Let me take you 
home!” 

“Wait! Have to see Desiranne.” 
Roan shook his head, started down 
the stairs. Daryl skipped ahead, 
dragging a picture in a heavy frame. 
At the foot of the stairs, he raised 
it high, brought it down on the 
bronze figure of a girl with a water 
jar; it burst into a cloud of dry 
chips. 

“The Mona Lisa,” he caroled. 
“The only one in the world — and 
1 destroyed it!” He spun on Roan. 
“Oh, Roan, doesn’t it give you a 
wonderful feeling of power? Those 
old ones that conquered the Uni- 
verse — they treasured all this! 
And we have the power to do as 
we like with it. They made it — we 
finish it! Doesn’t that make us their 
equals?” 

R oan stared past him at a bigger- 
than-life white marble of a 
thick-bodied woman with her gar- 
ment down around her hips. She was 
chipped and her arms were miss- 
ing. 

“Shame,” Roan mumbled. 
“Shouldn’t break ... old things.” 
He felt as though he were fall- 
ing.

IF 




“I didn’t do that one,” Daryl said. 
“Someone else . but I’U finish 
it!” He ran to the statue and push- 
ed. It didn’t budge. Daryl made a 
face and ran on to pull down a 
painting of a man with one ear 
missing. 

“It’s hot in here,” Roan said 
aloud. The walls were sailing by, 
going faster and faster. He grop^ 
for support, sank down on the steps. 
All around, people were running like 
Gracyls in moulting time, carrying 
things that smashed, or broke, or 
were torn apart. Someone started a 
blaze in the center of the floor, 
and pictures went flying into it. 
The floor shook as heavy marbles 
toppled. 

“Get a cutter,” a girl screamed, 
“to use on the bronzes!” 

“What a night!” Daryl exulted. 
“We did the Louvre long ago, and 
the Grand Palais e’Arte, and the 
Imperial Gardens. We were saving 
this one for a special occasion. And 
your being here — it’s just made it 
perfect!” 

Roan got to his feet, fighting 
the blackness. “I can’t wait any 
longer,” he shouted over the din. 
“Where’s Desiranne?” 

“Roan, Roan! Forget her for now! 
There’s her Performance coming! 
There’s lots of luscious sport to be 
had before then — ” 

Phrygette was there tucking back 
a strand of corn-yellow hair with 
a white arm smudged with soot. 

“I’m bored,” she said. “Daryl, 
let’s get on to the Performance.” 
“But there are stiU lots of things 
to do,” he cried, dancing round her. 
“The books! We haven’t even begun 



on the books — and the tapes, and 
the old films, and . and ...” 
“I’m going,” Phrygette pouted. 
She looked at Roan. He stared back, 
seeing her face danding in fire. 

“Don’t look at me like that,” she 
said. “You look so peculiar!” 

Roan took a deep breath ^nd held 
one part of his mind away from the 
whirling dizziness that ^veloped 
him. He produced something that 
could be defined as a smile. 

“If you were a sixteen thousand 
year throwback, you’d look pecu- 
liar, too.” He seemed to be watch- 
ing everything through a view- 
screen now; Daryl looked tiny and 
far away, and all around the floor 
curved upward. A wild singing 
whine rang in Roan’s ears. His face 
felt furnace-hot. “I want to see 
Desiranne now,” he said. 

“Oh, all right.” Daryl gave Phry- 
gette an icy look. “Spoilsports!” 

T hey were in a mouldy velvet and 
chipped gilt room lit by tiny 
lights glaring down from above like 
stars as seen in Deep Space, set in 
a ceiling that slanted away toward 
a small, bright-lit platform below. 
There were seats ranked beside 
Roan’s and more rows lower down, 
and others swinging in wide sweeps 
farther up, and still more, perched 
like tiny balconies just above the 
stage, and all of them were fUled 
with slim-necked, soot-streaked Men 
and Women. 

“In all that you’ve told me of 
other worlds. Roan,” Daryl said in 
a low, vibrant voice, “there has 
been nothing to equal what you will 
see Desiranne do here tonight.” 



EARTHBLOOD 



139 




“What will she do? Play some 
instrument? Sing?” The thought of 
seeing her again made his pulse 
throb in his head, driving back the 
sickness. He remembered Stellaraire 
and her erotic dancing. Surely Desir- 
anne wouldn’t do anything like 
that . 

“Master,” Sostelle whined at 
Roan’s side. “Please let me bring 
the doctor to see you now.” 

“The stuff you gave me is work- 
ing,” Roan said. “I feel better.” 

A blue mist blew across the stage. 
Out of it, a little blue and silver 
dog merged, singing an eerie, 
piercing little song in a register so 
high it was barely within hearing. 
The blue color faded, and now there 
were pale pastels — mauve, bluish 
pink, sunshine-yellow, rain-gray — 
swirls, clouds, blown foams. The 
blue dog’s song ended in a tiny yelp, 
and behind Roan, Sostelle winced. 
Roan could make out another figure 
in the mist now, dressed in diaphan- 
ous robes, swathed from head to 
foot. It came forward and the scarf 
blew from its head. It was Desir- 
anne and her pale hair swirled down 
about her shoulders. 

The music was low and gentle, 
almost a lullaby, and Desiranne ran 
gracefully, girlishly about in the 
mists, playing. Then, by degrees, 
the tempo changed and a drum be- 
gan to beat — an insistent, com- 
manding beat. Roan began to be 
aware of Daryl’s breathing beside 
him and he also remembered the 
fearful beat of the drums that night 
he stood frozen with fear by the 
high wire on Chlora, when he was 
with the circus. 



Was that it? Was that what was 
making the small hairs on his arms 
prickle, and bringing the smell of 
danger and the cold sweat in his 
stomach? Something ... he turned 
to Daryl to teU him to stop the 
show. Whatever it was going to be. 
Roan could feel it beginning to 
stink. Something was wrong. Some- 
thing . 

But Daryl was smiling expectantly 
and proudly at Desir^ne. 

“By the way,” he said. “Did I 
mention that she is my daughter?” 

“Your daughter?” Roan repeated 
dumbly. “You’re not old enough,” 
he blurted. 

Daryl looked astonished. “Not old 
enough . ...” A strange expres- 
sion crossed his face. “You mean 
— you’re ...” he gulped. “I re- 
member learning once that long ago, 
men died like dogs, after only a 
moment of life. Do you mean. Roan, 
that you — that you . ?” 

“Never mind.” On the stage, De- 
siranne had begun a slow, sensuous 
strip tease. The music became more 
and more insinuating, erotic, then 
slowed as Desiranne removed her 
last wisp of garment. As she pir- 
outed, all pink and gold in the lights, 
the little silver and blue dog came 
mincing out onto the stage with 
something sharp that glittered silver 
where the light caught it. 

It was a knife, long and leaf-thin 
and sharp. Desiranne dipped in her 
dance to pluck the stilleto from its 
cushion, danced away, and now a 
savage tempo took over. An animal 
music. It went straight to some dark, 
forgotten part of Roan’s mind and 
again fear began to swell in him

insistently. He came to his feet — 
Desiranne stopped, stood poised. 
She held the scalpel-keen blade in 
her right hand and with great grace 
and sure slowness, cut off the lit- 
tle finger of her left hand. 

A terrible cry tore itself from 
Roan’s throat. He plunged 
down through the crowd, not even 
aware of the screams and the smash 
of his fists on anything that im- 
peded him. With a leap he was on 
the stage, snatching the knife from 
Desiranne’s hand as she moved to 
stroke it across her wrist. He caught 
her, looked into eyes as vacant and 
dead as the glassless windows of a 
ruined city. 

“Why?” Roan screamed. “Why?” 
Blood ran down Desiranne’s arm. 
For a moment her eyes seemed to 
stir with returning life; then she 
wilted. Roan caught her up, whirled 
on the others who had crowded 
around the stage now, all shouting 
at once. The air reeked of blood; 
it was a taste in the mouth. 

“Get a doctor! She’ll die!” 
Daryl’s livid face was in front 
of him. He shook his fists over 
his head. His mouth looked loose 
and wet. 

“Your' daughter!” Roan said 
hoarsely, looking down at the small, 
gentle, beautiful face. “Your own 
daughter!” 

“She felt nothing! She was drug- 
ged! Do -you realize that her one 
chance for a perfect Death Per- 
formance is ruined forever? That 
this is all she has lived for and now 
she will never have it? I reared her 
for this, trained her myself! All 



these years I’ve kept her perfect, 
waiting for the one, the ideal occa- 
sion — and now — ” 

Roan snarled and kicked him 
brutally, and Daryl doubled over, 
mewing, coiled on the bloody floor. 

“Sostelle — get a Man-doctor!” 
Roan jumped down, ran toward the 
rear of the theater. Desiranne hung 
limp in his arms, hef face as pale 
as chalk. 

I n a vast gilt room. Desiranne lay 
on a narrow couch of pale 
green silk with curved legs wrought 
of silver and ivory. A small crowd 
of eager-eyed Terjans stood by, 
watching. The doctor, a scrubbed- 
looking dog carrying a pouch, cluck- 
ed and sprayed something from the 
pouch over Desiranne’s stumped fin- 
ger, looking over at Roan. 

“She will survive. The tourniquet 
saved her from excessive bleeding. 
A pity. So fair she was. But you. 
Sir; you don’t look well. Sostelle tells 
me — ” 

“Never mind me! Why doesn’t 
she wake up? Are you sure she isn’t 
going to die?” 

“She won’t die. I’ll see to a bud 
implant from self-germinal tissue, 
and in a year or two, with the pro- 
per stimuli, she’ll be as good as 
now. Now I must insist. Sir. Let me 
have a look at you.” 

“All right.” Roan sank down in 
a high-backed chair. The doctor 
applied smooth, cold metal objects 
to him, muttered to himself. 

“You’re sick. Master,” he said. 
“Temperature over one hundred and 
four; blood-pressure — ” 

“Just give me some medicine,” 



EARTHBLOOD

Roan interrupted. “My head aches.” 
“I’ve heard a bit of your back- 
ground, sir,” the doctor said as he 
rummaged in his bag. “I think I 
see what’s happened here. You’ve 
no immunity to the native diseases 
of Terra. And, of course, they find 
in you a perfect host. Now — ” 
“I’ve never been sick,” Roan said, 
“not like this. I thought it was just 
the wine, but ...” He tottered in 
the chair as a wave of dizziness pass- 
ed over him. 

“Master!” Sostelle was at Roan’s 
side, “They are coming — Master 
Hugh and many others — and with 
them are the Enforcers. Kotschai 
himself!” 

“Good!” Roan snarled, showing 
his teeth. “I need something to fight! 
Terrans are no good — they just fall 
down and cry.” 

“Please, Sir,” the doctor said 
sharply. “You must stand still if 
I’m to administer my medicants!” 
“Doctor,” Sostelle whimpered. 
“Give him something to bring back 
his strength. See how he faints!” 
“Ummm, yes, there are stimulants 
— dangerous, mind you, but — ” 
“Quickly! They come! I smell 
them! I smell the odor of human 
hate!” 

“The scent is thick here in this 
room,” the doctor grunted. He 
sprayed something cold against the 
inner side of Roan’s elbow. 

“Master, you must flee now.” 
Sost^le took his arm. 

Roan shook him off. “Bring ’em 
on,” he yelled. “I want to crush 
the life out of something! I want to 
pay them back for what they did 
to Desiranne!” 



“But, Master, Kotschai is strong 
and cruel and skilled in inflicting 
pain — ” 

“So am I,” Roan shouted. Ice 
seemed to be pumping through his 
veins. The ringing in his head had 
receded to a distant humming. Sud- 
denly he was light, strong, his vision 
keen; only his heart seemed to 
pound too loudly. 

“Oh, Master, there are many of 
them,” Sostelle cried. “You cannot 
kill them all. And you are sick. Run 
quickly, while I delay them!” 

“Sostelle — go and find Askor 
and Sidis. Get them and bring them 
to the ship.” 

“If I do as you command. Mas- 
ter, will you make your escape? 
The door is there; it leads by a nar- 
row way to the street below.” 

“All right,” Roan let his breath 
out in a hiss between his teeth. “I’ll 
run. Just get them and send them 
to me — and take care of this poor 
girl.” 

“I will. Master!” 

“Good-bye, Sostelle. You were 
the best Man I found on Terra.” He 
opened the door and stepped through 
into dusty gloom. 

The street was not like the others 
Roan had seen on Terra. It was un- 
lit, with broken pavement through 
which rank weeds grew. He ran, 
and behind him dogs yelped and 
called. 

There was a gate ahead, a stark 
thing of metal bars and cruel spikes. 
Roan recognized it from Daryl’s 
description. Beyond it he saw the 
ominous darkness, smelled the filth 
and decay of the Lower Town. 
Without pausing, he leaped up.

pulled himself to the top, and drop- 
ped on the other side. 

XL 

R oan didn’t know how many 
hours later it was. He had run 
— for miles, it seemed — through 
dark, twisting, ancient streets, emp-. 
ty of people, with the police baying 
at his heels. Once they cornered 
him in a crumbling courtyard, and 
he killed two of them as they closed 
in, then leaped up, caught a low- 
hanging roof’s edge and fled away 
across the broken slates where they 
could not follow. 

Now he was in a street crowded 
with faces that were like those re- 
membered from evil dreams. Ter- 
rans, with scars, pock-marks, dis- 
ease-ravaged faces and starvation 
racked bodies. Women with eyes 
like the sockets in a skull held out 
bony hands, quavering pleas for 
bread and copper; children like dart- 
ing brown spiders with oversized 
eyes and knobby knee joints trailed 
him, shouting in incomprehensible 
language. A vast, obese man with 
one eye and an odor of old sick- 
ness trailed him for two blocks, 
until Roan turned, snatched up a 
foot-long knife from a display be- 
fore a tumble-down stall and ges- 
tured with it. 

There were no dogs here, only the 
warped, crooked people and the evil 
stench and the glare of unshielded 
lights and the sense of age and 
decay and bottomless misery. Roan 
could feel the strength going from 
his legs. He stumbled often. Once 
he fell, and rested a while on hands 



and knees before he could stand 
again, shouting to scatter the ring 
of glittering-eyed people who had 
closed in on him. 

He felt a burning, terrible thirst, 
and went toward a smoky, liquory, 
loud-smelling bar. Inside, it was hot, 
steamy, solid with noise that sawed 
at him like ragged knives. He sank 
down at a wobbly table. A green- 
toothed female slid into the seat 
beside him and elbowed him invit- 
ingly. Roan made a growling sound 
and she went away. 

A huge, big-bellied Man was 
standing before him. 

“What’ll it be?” he growled in 
very bad Terran. 

“Water,” Roan said in a dry whis- 
per. “Cold water.” 

“Water costs too,” the man said. 
He went away and came back with 
a thick, greasy tumbler, half full 
of grayish liquid. 

“I have no money,” Roan said. 
“Take this.” He fumbled the gold- 
en clasp from his garment, tossed 
it on the table. 

The barman picked it up, eyed it 
suspiciously, bit into it. 

“Hey,” he grunted. “That’s real 
gold!” 

“I need ... a place to rest,” Roan 
said. The sickness was back in 
full force now, washing up around 
him like water rising in a sinking 
ship. “Get me a doctor . .” 

“You sick, huh?” The Man was 
leaning toward him, leering. His 
eyes swelled until they were as big 
as saucers. Roan forced his eyes 
shut, then opened them, fighting to 
hold onto consciousness. 

“I know . where there’s more 



EARTHBLOOD 



143 




...” He could feel his luind cut- 
ting loose from his body again* 
ready to float away into a toss- 
ing sea of fever fantasies. But he 
couldn’t — not yet. He tried to 
get to his feet, slammed back into 
the chair. The glass clashed against 
his teeth. 

“Drink up, buddy.” the thick 

voice was saying. “Yeah, I’ll get a 
doc fer yuh. You know where there’s 
more, eh?” 

Roan gulped. The warmish, stag- 
nant-smelling liquid gagged him. 
The man brought more water, cold 
this time and in a slightly cleaner 
glass, as though he had wiped it 
on his shirt. 

“Look, Bo, you take it easy, 

huh? I’m Soup the Insider. Sure, 

I’ll fix yuh up with a room. Swell 
room, bed and everything. Private. 
Only look around good before yuh 
close the door. Yuh can never tell 
what yuh might be locking yourself 
in with.” He guffawed. 

“Got to have rest,” Roan man- 
aged. “Be ... all right in the 
morning. Find my friends. Hope 

Desiranne is all right. Then get 
out . this filthy place . .” 

“You just take it easy, Bub. I’ll 
fix yuh up good. Then we’ll talk 
about where to get more of these 
little knick-knacks. And you don’t 
talk to nobody else, see?” 

“Get me ... .” Roan gave up 
trying to talk and felt the big man’s 
arm^under his, leading him away. 

H e fought his way up from a 
nightmare of heat and pur- 
suit and blood and cruelty. He 
opened his eyes. 



There was a spotted glare panel 
set in a blotched ceiling, casting a 
sick light on a threadbare velvet 
wall with nauseous4ooking stains. 
An ancient, withered Man stood 
beside the bed, blinking down at 
him with eyes that were polished 
stones set in pockets of inflamed 
tissue. 

“Sick ye are, true enough, lad. 
Ye’ve caught every ailment I ever 
heard of and six or eight I haven’t, 
you.” 

Roan tried to sit up. His head 
barely twitched, and pain shot 
through it like an axe-blow. He lay, 
waiting for the throbbing to sub- 
side. His stomach ached as though 
it had been stamped by booted feet, 
and a sickness seemed to fester 
through his body like sewage bub- 
bling in a cesspool. 

“Sore, hey?” the oldster cackled. 
“Well it might be. Ye’ve tossed up 
every meal ye’ve et since ye learned 
to guide spoon to lip, you.” 

Through the wall Roan heard an 
angry scream and a slap. “For half 
a copper I don’t even smile!” a fe- 
male voice shrilled, and a door 
slammed. 

“Got to get out,” Roan said. He 
tried to throw back the rough blan- 
ket, and the blackness swirled again. 

“ . him something to make 
him talk,” the thick voice of the big 
man was saying. 

“Whatever ye say, Soup. But it’ll 
kill him, it.” 

“Just so he talks first.” 

Roan felt a cold touch on bis 
arm, a sharp stab of pain. 

“Where’s the loot, Bo?” Soup’s 
thick voice demanded. 



144 



IF 




“Ye’ll have to wait a little hour, 
Soup. First he’ll sleep a bit, eh, to 
get back the strength to talk, he.” 
“All right. But if you let him die 
before he spills. I’ll squeeze that 
scrawny neck of yours.” 

“No fear o’ that. Soup.” 

Time passed, like a storm of 
yellow dust that choked and harried 
and would never cease. Sometimes 
voices stabbed at him, and he 
cursed them and struck out. Again 
he was running, falling, and far 
away on the floodlit stage the knife 
was cutting into Desiranne’s white 
flesh. He fought his way toward 
her, but always the sea of mad 
faces blocked his way until he 
screamed and clawed his way out 
of the dream. 

“ . tell me now, before the 
blasted glutton comes back, he,” 
a scratchy voice was saying. “Then 
I’ll give ye more nice medicine, and 
ye’ll sleep like a whelp at a bitch’s 
teat.” 

“Get . away ... me ” 
Roan managed. “Got . go . .” 
Something sharp and painful 
poked his throat. 

“Ah, ye felt that, then, lad? Good. 
Now speak once more, tell old Yagg 
where the pretty treasures lie. Not 
in Upper' City, eh? For the dogs 
would tear a man to bits if ever he 
ventured there. Where, eh? Is there 
some house that’s been missed?” 
There was a great smash, and 
a bull roar. 

^ “So! Yuh’d cheat Soup, would 
yuh? I’ll rip your head off!” 

“Now, Soup — you misjudge me, 
you! I was just trying to find out 
for you. No harm, what?” 



There was a growl and a sound 
of two heavy blows and a squeal. 
Then Soup’s wide face loomed over 
Roan, breathing foul breath and 
flecks of spittle. 

“All right, give. Bo! You ain’t 
going to die and not tell Soup, 
not after he give yuh a place to 
die in!” 

Roan croaked, and liis hand mov- 
ed feebly. “Tell . you . later 
...” The face fad^ and Soup’s 
voice mumbled, drifted off into the 
insistent clamor of fever images. 

ight again, and sounds. 

“ . didn’t you send for me 
sooner?” a tremulous voice was com- 
plaining. “That quack Yagg like to 
killed him, with his poisons! He’s 
full of disease! Look at those sores 
— and see the swelling here. He’ll 
die. Mark my words, he’s a goner. 
But we can do our best.” 

“Yuh better.” 

Stellaraire was standing by the 
bed, looking down at him. Her hair 
was burnt off and her face was 
scarred and blistered. 

“Come with me, Roan,” she said 
urgently. “We’ll leave this ’zoo and 
go so far away they’ll never find 
us. Come! Then she was running 
away, and Henry Dread was shoot- 
ing after her, the blaster bolts echo- 
ing along the steel corridor, echo- 
ing .. 

Henry Dread bolstered the gun. 
“Damned Gooks,” he said. “But 
you and I Roan. We’re different. 
We’re Terries.” His face changed, 
became small and petulant. “I 
trained her,” Daryl said. “What 
higher art form can there be than

destruction? And the destruction of 
one’s self is its highest expression 
. Deftly, Daryl fitted a noose 
about his neck, hoisted himself up. 
His face became black and twisted 
and terrible. “You see?” he said 
pleasantly. He went on talking, and 
many voices chimed in, and they 
cheered and the dust cleared away 
and Iron Robert held up his arms, 
melted off at the elbow. 

“Iron Robert born to fight. 
Roan,” he said. “Can’t fight, now. 
Time for Iron Robert to die.” He 
turned and the iron door opened and 
he walked into the furnace. The 
flames leaped out of the open door, 
scorching Roan’s face. He turned 
away, and rough hands pulled him 
back. 

“Yuh can’t die yet,” Soup’s voice 
said. “Yuh been laying We for 
two days and two night, yelling to 
yourself. Now talk, danm you, or 
I’ll choke the life out of yuh!” 
Hands like leather-covered stone- 
crushers closed on Roan’s throat — 

There was a terrible growling, and 
then a scream. And suddenly the 
hands were gone and there were 
awful sounds of Tearing flesh and 
threshing limbs. 

And then Sostelle’s face was 
leaning over him, and there was 
blood on the dog’s jaw. 

“Master! I came as quickly as I 
could!” ■ 

Roan cried out, turned away 
from the phantom. 

“Master! It’s your dog, Sostelle! 
And I have another with me. Look, 
Master!” 

A cool hand touched Roan’s fore- 
head. There was a faint odor of a 



delicate perfume, almost lost in the 
stench of the foul room. Roan open- 
ed his eyes. Desiranne looked down 
at him. Her face was pale and he 
could see the faint blue tracing of 
the veins in her eyelids. But she 
smiled at him. 

“It’s all right now. Roan,” she 
said softly. “I am with you.” 

“Are you . real?” 

“As real as any of us,” she said. 
“Your hand . ” 

She held it up, swathed in band- 
ages. “I’m sorry I’m no longer per- 
fect, Roan.” 

The dog doctor appeared, look- 
ing concerned. He talked, but Roan 
couldn’t hear him for the thunder 
in his ears. He lay and watched 
Desiranne’s face until she faded and 
dissolved in mist, and then the mist 
itself faded into darkness shot with 
lights, and the lights twinkled like 
distant stars, and then went out, one 
by one. 

R oan was sitting up in bed. His 
arm, resting on the patched 
blanket over his knees, was so thin 
that his fingers met around it, and 
it was scarred with half-healed pock 
marks. Desiranne sat by the bed, 
feeding him thin soup. 

Her face was thin and paler than 
ever, and her hair was cut short, 
held back by a simple scarf of clean 
cloth. Roan lifted his hand, took 
the spoon. 

“I can do that now,” he said. 
The spoon trembled, spilling soup; 
but he went on to empty the bowl. 

“I’m stronger now,” he said. “I’m 
getting up.” 

“Roan, rest a few days more.” 



146 



IF 




“No. We’ve got to get to the ship 
now, Desiranne. How long has it 
been? Weeks? Maybe Askor and 
Sidis will be there, waiting for me. 
We’ll leave this poisoned world and 
never come back.” He had thrown 
back the blanket and put 'his feet 
down on the floor. His legs were 
so thin that a choked laugh grunt- 
ed from him. 

“I look like old Targ,” he said. 
With Desiranne’s hand under his 
arm, he stood, feeling his senses 
fade in vertigo from the effort. He 
took a step and fell, and Desiranne 
cried out and then Sostelle was 
there, helping him back into the 
rags of the cot. 

I t was a week later. Roan sat in 
a chair by the window, looking 
out at the decayed roofs and tot- 
tering waUs of Lower Town. There 
was a sickly plant in a clay pot 
on the windowsill, and a fresh 
breeze brought odors of springtime 
and corruption. 

Sostelle came in, carrying a patch- 
ed cloak. 

“This is all I could get, Master.” 
I told you never to call me ‘Mas- 
ter’ again,” Roan snapped. “My 
name is Roan.” 

“Yes . Roan. Here is a gar- 
ment. But please don’t go. Not yet. 
The dogs are about again today.” 
Roan stood, ignoring the dizzi- 
ness. “We’re going today. Askor 
and Sidis are probably waiting for 
me, wondering what happened. They 
probably think I’m dead.” His fin- 
gers fumbled with the chipped but- 
tons. 

“Yes, Mas — Roan.” The dog 



helped him with the cloak. It was 
a faded blue, of a rough weave that 
scratched Roan’s pale skin. Desir- 
anne appeared at the door. 

“Roan — you’re so weak.” 

“I’m all right.” He forced himself 
to smile gently at her, to walk with- 
out staggering across to her. “It’s 
not far,” he said. “We can do It.” 

They went down patched stairs, 
ignoring the eyes that stored from 
half-concealment at the dog who 
had torn the throat out of the for- 
midable Soup, and the pale Upper 
woman, and the sick madman. Out 
in the sun-bleached time-eroded 
street other faces, weather-burned 
and life-scarred, watched as they 
passed. When one of the watchers 
ventured too close, Sostelle bared 
his fangs and they drew back. 

After half an hour. Roan and 
his escort stopped to rest at a dry 
fountain with broken carvings of 
Men with the tails of fish. Roan 
looked at them, and wondered on 
what world they lived. He and 
Desiranne sat on the carved stone 
lop of the monument, feeling the 
warmth of the sun, while Sostelle 
paced up and down, his human- 
like hands hooked in his leather 
belt. When Roan had rested, they 
went on. 

It was late afternoon when they 
reached the raised avenue that ran 
past the port and on to the bright 
towers of Upper City. Roan shaded 
his eyes, staring past the orderly 
trees and the banked flowers in 
the distance. 

“Where is it?” he said. “I don’t 
see the ship.” There was a new sick 
feeling in him now, not the fever 



EARTHBLOOD 



147 




oi pain and infection, but the hol- 
low sickness of terrible loss. He 
scrambled up the embankment, led 
the way along under the gentle trees. 
He could see parked flyers, the 
flash of color of moving chariots, 
the tiny figures of dogs at work; 
but HelVs Whore was gone. 

“Perhaps the people, sir,” Sos- 
telle said. “Master Daryl and the 
others may have moved her.” 

“They couldn’t have,” Roan said 
in a voice that almost broke. “Only 
Askor and Sidis knew how to open 
her ports — how to lift her.” 

“Roan — we must go back now.” 
Desiranne’s hand was on his arm. 
He touched the thin fingers, looking 
at Sostelle. 

“You knew,” he said. 

“Roan — I could not be sure — 
and how could I have told you?” 
“It’s all right.” Roan tried des- 
perately to hold his voice firm. “At 
least they got away. 1 knew those 
pansies couldn’t hold them.” 
“Perhaps one day they’ll come 
back. Roan,” Sostelle said. “Per- 
haps — ” 

“No. They’re gone, back to where 
they belong — out there.” Roan 
tilted his head back, looking up 
into the bottomless blue of the deep 
sky. “I sent them away myself,” 
be said. “I betrayed them to their 
enemies and then turned my back 
on them. There’s nothing for them 
to come back for.” 

XLI 

R oan sat with Desiranne and Sos- 
telle at a small table in the bar 
that Soup the Insider had once 



owned. It was evening. The room 
was filled with yellow light and 
the last of the day’s heat. In one 
corner, a Man with magic fingers 
caressed a stringed instrument that 
mourned for love and courage and 
other forgotten things. A one-eyed 
Man came in silently from the 
street, crossed to their table. 

“I seen another patrol,” he said 
accusingly. “You and yer woman 
and yer dog better pull out to- 
night.” 

Roan looked at him with an 
expression that was the absence of 
all expression. 

“Yer calling ’em down on us,” 
the Man said, his lips twisting with 
the hates that ate at him like crabs. 
“When the dogs get on a Man’s 
trail, they don’t never quit. And 
long’s they’re here in the Town, 
ain’t nobody safe.” 

“They’re not looking for me,” 
Roan said. “Not after a year. I’m 
not that important.” 

“A year — ten years. It’s all the 
same to dogs. They ain’t like a Man. 
They’re trained to hunt — and that’s 
what they’re doing.” 

“He’s right. Roan,” Sostelle said. 
“Kotschai will never forget the Man 
who shamed him by escaping him. 
Perhaps we’d best leave now, and 
find another place.” 

“I’m not leaving,” Roan said. “If 
they want me, let them find me.” 
He looked at the one-eyed Man. “If 
you fought them — if we all fought 
them — we could wipe them out. 
There are only a few hundred of 
them. Then you could leave this 
pest-hole. You could spread out into 
the countryside, start new villages — ”

IF 




The Man shook his head. “You 
was lucky,” he said. “You got clear 
of ’em. But that was because you 
was in Upper Town, where they 
wasn’t expecting no trouble. When 
they come down here, they come in 
packs, with nerve guns and organ- 
ization. Nobody’s going to jump 
that kind of force. And neither are 
you.” He straightened, showing his 
teeth. “You’re going to get out, like 
I said — or you ain’t going to live 
long.” 

Roan laughed at him. “Is that 
a threat? Is being dead worse than 
living in this ghetto?” 

“Your’e going to find out pretty 
soon, you and your . friends.” 
He swaggered away. 

“Roan,” Sostellel started. “We 
could leave by night, make our way 
to — ” 

“I’m going out.” Roan stood. “I 
need fresh air.” 

“Roan! You’re challenging the 
dogs — and the Men as well I” 

Desiranne caught at his hand. 
‘They’ll see us.” 

Roan pushed her gently back. 
“Not us. Just me. Let them be- 
ware.” 

“I’m going with you.” 

“Stay here with Sostelle,” Roan 
said flatly. “I’ve hidden from them 
for a year. That’s long enough.” 

As he walked away, he heard 
Sostelle say: “Let him go, mistress. 
A Man like Roan cannot live for- 
ever as a hunted slave.” 

T he rumor ran ahead of Roan. 

People stared, made mystical 
signs, then darted out to follow as 
he strode along, taking the center of 



the hut and garbage-choked street. 
Others slipped away into decay- 
slimed alleyways to spread the 
word . 

The last of sunset faded. The few 
automatic polyarcs that still worked 
came on, shedding their tarnished 
brilliance on broken walks, cracked 
facades and Roan, walking the night 
with his shadow striding ahead. 

“They’re close,” someone called 
to Roan from a doorway. “Better 
run quick. Mister Fancy-talk!” 

He was in a wide avenue with a 
center strip of hard-packed dirt 
where flowers had once grown. At 
the far end was the wide collon- 
aded front of a building white in 
the glare from a tall pole-mounted 
light. Tall weeds poked up among 
marble slabs there. Rude huts grew 
like toadstools in the shadows of 
the chipped pediments. 

A dog appeared on the broken 
steps, standing tall, curve-shouldered, 
cringe-legged, cruel-fanged, wearing 
the straps and sparkling medalions 
of the police. Roan walked toward 
him, and the trailing crowd fell 
back. 

“Stop there, red-haired Man!” the 
dog yelped. He drew the curiously 
shaped gun strapped under his fore- 
leg and pointed it at Roan. “You’re 
under arrest.” ’ 

“Run,” Roan said in a strange, 
flat voice. “Run, or I’ll kill you.” 

“What? Kill me? You’re a fool. 
Red-hair. I have a gun.” 

Roan broke into a run straight 
toward the dog. The animal crouch- 
ed and fired. In the sudden shock 
of pain Roan felt his legs knot 
and cramp, and he fell. The dog 



EARTHBLOOD 



149 




stalked up to him, waving back 
the gathering crowd. 

Ifs only pain, Roan told himself. 
He rested on hands and knees. Pain 
is nothing. Dying without feeling 
his tfiroat under your hands is the 
true agony. 

He rose to his feet in a sudden 
movement, and the police dog 
whirled, reaching for the gun. But 
Roan’s swing caught him below his 
cropped ear, sent him spinning. With 
a growl, the dog scrambled to all 
fours, and Roan’s foot met him un- 
der the jaw with a solid impact. 

The shaved body rolled aside and 
lay still. Roan stooped, picked up 
the gun, as a mutter of alarm swept 
across the mob. 

“You see?” Roan shouted. 
“They’re dogs — nothing more!” 

“Now they’ll kill you for sure!” 
a gaunt woman yelled. “Serve you 
right, too, you trouble-bringer!” 

“Here they come!” another voice 
screeched. Two more dogs had ap- 
peared from the ruin, coming on 
at a relentless loj>e. Roan took aim 
and shot one. It fell yelping and 
kicking out, and the other veered 
aside and dashed for safety. The 
crowd shouted now. 

“But these are just ordinary dogs.” 
The one-eyed Man had come up 
close to Roan. “Wait until you 
meet Kotschai, face to face. Then 
you’ll learn the taste of honest 
fear.” 

“They say he’s three hundred 
years old,” a short, clay-faced man 
said. “His masters have given him 
their magic medicine to make him 
live long, and with every passing 
year he’s grown more wise and evil. 



My gran’fer remembered him — ” 
“He’s just a dog,” Roan shout- 
ed. “And you’re Men!” 

A cross the square a squad of 
uniformed dogs burst into view, 
fanned out, halted, facing the crowd, 
which recoiled, leaving Roan to 
stand alone. 

Then an avenue opened through 
the police and an immense dog 
paced through. In silence he ad- 
vanced across the plaza' skirted the 
injured dog which was crawling 
painfully, whimpering. A dozen feet 
from Roan, he halted. 

“Who dares defy Kotschai the 
Punisher?” he growled. He was 
taller than Roan, massive-bodied, 
with the thick, sinewy forelegs of 
a tiger and jaws like a timber-wolf. 
His body had been shaved except 
for a ruff around the neck. His 
pinkish-gray hide was a maze of 
scars. He was dressed in straps and 
bangles of shiny metal decorated 
with enamel. There was a harness 
studded with spikes of brass across 
his chest. Above his yellow eyes 
was a brass horn that seemed to be 
set in the bone of his brute-flat 
skull. His tail had been broken 
and badly set. It swung nervously, 
as thought it hurt all the time. 

“How does a dog dare to chal- 
lenge a Man?” Roan demanded. 

“It is the order of my Master.” 
The wicked jaws grinned and a pink 
tongue licked black gums. 

“Can you fight all of us?” Roan 
motioned toward the silent mob. 

“They do not count,” Kotschai 
said. “Only you. I see you have a 
gun, too. But my dogs have more.” 



150 



IF 




“You and I don’t need guns,” 
Roan said. “We have hands and 
teeth for fighting.” 

Kotsohai looked at Roan with 
his small, red-circled eyes. He lifted 
his muzzle and sniffed the air. 

“Yes,” the dog said. “I smell the 
odor of human blood-lust.” He 
seemed to shiver. “It is not a scent 
I love. Master.” 

“Then you’d better learn how to 
crouch on all fours and heel on 
command dog,” Roan said loudly, 
so that everyone could hear. 

“I have never learned such les- 
sons, Master,” Kotschai said. 

“You haven’t had a proper teach- 
er, dog.” 

“That may be true.” Kotschai 
motioned his dogs back. He un- 
buckled his gun harness, threw it 
aside. 

“It is said that once Man was 
Terra’s most deadly predator,” he 
said. “I have wondered long how 
it was that the pretty creatures I 
call Master made the dogs their 
slaves. Perhaps in you I see the 
answer.” 

“Perhaps in me you see your 
death.” 

Kotschai nodded. “Perhaps. And 
now I must punish you. Master.” 

Roan tossed, the gun to a Man, 
reached to his shoulder, ripped loose 
the clasp that held his garment, 
wrapped the ragged cloth around his 
left forearm. 

“Now I’ll instruct you in courte- 
sy, dog,” he said, and Kotschai 
snarled and charged. 

R oan’s padded arm struck into the 
open jaws as the dog’s bristly 



body slammed against him. He stum- 
bled back, twisting aside from the 
horn that raked his jaw. He locked 
his free arm around the dog’s 
shoulders, keeping his face above 
the viscious chest spikes, and to- 
gether Man and dog fell. Roan lock- 
ed his legs around the heavy torso. 
Kotschai snarled, raking with all 
four limbs as Roan locked arms 
and legs crushed, crushed — 

With a frantic effort, the dog 
wrenched his jaws half free of 
Roan’s strangling forearm. He 
lunged for a better grip with his 
teeth, and Roan struck with his 
fist, kicked free, hurled the animal 
from him. Kotschai scrambled to his 
feet, jaws agape, the stubble along 
his spine erect. Roan faced him, 
blood on his arm, teeth bared in 
an ancient defience. All around, 
dogs and Men stood silent, gaping 
at the spectacle of Men pitted 
against beast. 

The dog charged again. Roan 
slipped aside, dropped on the broad 
back, locked ankles under the dog’s 
belly, wrapped his arms around the 
thick neck, pressing his face close 
to the mightily-muscled shoulder. 
Kotschai went down, rolled, and 
Roan held on, throttling the breath 
in the dog’s throat. Kotschai reared 
high, tottering under the weight of 
the Man on his back, throwing his 
horned head from side to side. 
Roan’s grip loosened — 

At once, the dog twisted, the great 
jaws snapping a hair’s breath from 
Roan’s unprotected shoulder. Roan 
doubled his fist, struck a smashing 
blow across the dog’s face, but the 
jaws snapped again, and this time 



EARTHBLOOD 



151 




they met hide and muscle. Roan 
found a grip on the corded throat, 
forcing the fanged head back. He 
felt the looked teeth tear his flesh. 

The garment wrapping Roan’s arm 
had slipped down. It flapped in 
in the dog’s face, and the animal 
snapped at it. In the instant’s diver- 
sion, Roan ripped free; but even 
as he retreated a step the dog was 
on him, and again the rag-snarled 
fist was thrust into the yawning 
jaws, and again Roan fell, and now 
Kotschai was above him, snarling 
and worrying the impeding gag, 
struggling to find a clear thrust at 
Roan’s throat, while Roan fought 
to hold the fighting body close .... 

A minute that was an eternity 
passed, while the two antagonists 
contended, chest to chest, their 
agonized breathing the only sound 
in all the wide plaza. And slowly the 
jaws grew closer. 

Roan’s grip loosened. He looked 
into the yellow eyes, and felt the 
hot, inhuman ferocity that burned 
an inch from his face now. And then 
he saw another face, above and 
behind that of the dog — the fea- 
tures set and pale, the one eye glar- 
ing — 

There was a shock, and the pres- 
sure was gone. Kotschai kicked con- 
vulsivdy, growling. The growl be- 
came a howl, choked off. Roan 
thrust the two-hundred pound body 
from him, got to his knees, then 
to hisTeet. Blood was running hot 
across his chest from the wound 
in his shoulder, and his breath was 
raw in his throat. 

He was aware of the Man stand- 
ing before him, looking half-tri- 



umphant, half afraid, and of a roar 
from the mob of humans, and of the 
dogs starting forward uncertainly, 
guns ready. Roan shook out his torn 
and bloody tunic, pulled it on. 

“Thanks,” Roan said, then yelled 
and charged the advancing dogs. 

H e felt the wash of fire as the 
field of a nerve gun touched 
him, and then he was on the near- 
est dog, feeling the solid smash of 
his fists on hide, and then' the shout- 
ing was all about him and the ragged 
horde leaped past him, howling out 
their long-pent fury. The dogs fought 
bravely. But as quickly as one Man 
fell another leaped his body to 
grapple his antagonist. The police 
fell back almost to the broken mar- 
ble steps of the ruined building 
before whistles and barkings sounded 
from a side way. 

Now more dogs arrived, long pink 
tongues hanging out, stub tails whip- 
ping, firing as they came; and still 
more Men scrambled to join the 
fight which had spread all across the 
square now. 

The one-eyed Man was beside 
Roan. His face was bleeding from 
a dog bite but his single eye gleamed 
with life. 

“I killed three of ’em” he yelled. 
“Got one by the throat and choked 
him till he died!” He ran on. 

The dogs had formed a tight 
phalanx, guns aimed outward to 
sweep the crowd, and they retreated 
slowly as Men rushed at them, 
shouting curses, leaping the bodies 
of the fallen, striking out with clubs, 
knives, fists. Now the dogs reached 
a narrow way, and more Men fell 



152 



IF 




as the enemy retreated, leaving a 
trail of casualties behind them. They 
reached a gate, and slipped through 
it and it clanged behind them. The 
Men tried to climb it, but the dogs 
shot them down, and they fell, all 
but one who hung, impaled on spear- 
points. 

But a wild yell was echoing along 
the street, across the plaza. Men 
and women danced, screaming their 
triumph. The one-eyed Man was 
back, seizing Roan’s arm, pumping 
his hand. 

“We beat ’em! he was shouting 
at the top of his lungs. 

“They’ll be back!” Roan shouted. 
“We’ll have to collect the weapons, 
set up a defensive position ...” 

No one was listening. Roan turn- 
ed to another Man as One-eye darted 
away, tried to explain that the dogs 
had retired in good order for tac- 
tical reasons, that they would renew 
the assault as soon as reinforcements 
arrived with heavy weapons. 

It was useless. The Lowers cap- 
ered, all yelling at once. 

Something made Roan look up- 
ward. A point of brilliant light 
sparkled and winked against the 
night sky, and Roan felt the clutch 
of a ghostly hand at his heart. 

“A ship!”' he said aloud, feeling 
his voice choke. 

“Roan!” 

He whirled. Sostelle was there, 
unruffled by the frenzy all about. 
“The Lady Desiranne commanded 
me to come.” 

Roan clutched at him. “It’s a 
ship!” he said hoarsely, pointing. 

“Yes, Roan. We saw it from the 
roof top. Or, Roan! Is it your ship?” 



A great searchlight lanced out 
from the port area. The finger of 
chalky bluish light glared on low 
clouds, found the ship, glinted on 
its side. 

“No,” Roan said, and the gJfcOSt- 
ly hand gripped even tighter. “It’s 
not my ship. It’s a big one. A dndod- 
naught of the line. It’s Trishindst and 
his plunderers of the Imperial Ter- 
ran Navy.” 

XLII 

R oan and Sostelle watched from 
the shelter of the causeway as 
the mile-long vessel suspended itself 
five miles over the city, like an 
elongated moon ablaze with lights 
from stem to stern. It’s pressor 
beams were columns of pale fire 
bearing on smoking pits, spaced at 
hundred yard intervals across the 
flower beds and glassy pavement of 
the landing ramps. Three smaller 
shapes of light had detached them- 
selves from the mother vessel, drop- 
ping quickly toward the Earth. 

“They’re landing about three 
hundred Men,” Roan said. “How 
many fighting dogs are there?” 

“I don’t know. Roan. Perfiaps 
as many, perhaps more. But look 
there!” 

From the Upper City, a flock of 
flyers had appeared, moving swiftly 
toward the port. Roan could see 
the crossed-bones insignia of the 
police blazoned on the sides of the 
grim, gray machines. The landing 
craft from the ITN battleship were 
settling to the broad pavement iKXW. 
Ports cycled open. A cascade of 
men poured out of each, fommed 



EARTHBLOOD 



153 




up in ragged columns. The police 
flyers closed ranks, hurtling to the 
attack at low altitude. Something 
sparkled from tihe prow of the first 
landing craft in line, and the lead 
flyer exploded into arcing frag- 
ments with a flash that lit the 
landscape for two miles around in 
dusty orange light. The other po- 
lice vessels scattered, screaming 
away at flank speed, hugging the 
ground, but not before an aerial 
torpedo got away to burst near an 
ITN column, sending half a dozen 
men sprawling. 

“The dogs are brave enough,” 
Roan said. But they don’t know how 
to fight a force like Trishinist’s. The 
ship won’t fire. He’ll want the city 
intact to loot. But the ground party 
will walk through them to take the 
city, and then they’ll come on to 
Lower Town, and from here they’ll 
go on to the next city, and when 
they’re finished there’ll be nothing 
left but ashes.” 

“Perhaps if the Lowers joined 
with the dogs — ” 

“No use. They’re just a mob, 
drunk on a taste of victory.” 

“Why, Roan?” Sostelle whined. 
“What do these Men seek here? 
Surely in the wide skies there must 
be worlds enough for all crea- 
tures.” 

“They destroy for the love of it 
— like Daryl and his friends. Poor 
Terra. Her last, forlorn hope is 
gone ^now.” 

The landing force had advanced 
across the ramp to the reception 
buildings. A detachment broke off. 
Roan saw the wink of guns as they 
smashed their way into the glass- 



walled lounge where he had met 
Daryl that first day, so long ago. 
The dog^, meanwhile, had ground- 
ed their flyers and were advancing 
in open order across a wide park 
to intercept the invaders at the 
causeway. 

“Terra’s own lost, wandering sons 
— returned to deal her her death- 
blow,” Sostelle whisp>ered. “In a 
sad world, this is the crowning sad- 
ness.” 

Roan was studying the advanc- 
ing ITN column. Even from the 
distance of half a mile he could 
make out the hulking forms, the 
shambling gaits of the mongrel hu- 
mans in the blue and silver uni- 
forms. Two large Men marched at 
the head of the column, a smaller 
figure between them.” 

Sostelle raised his nose and sniff- 
ed. 

“Look there!” Roan said. 

“My eyes are not as keen as 
those of a Man, Roan.” 

Roan was on his feet. His heart 
beat in his throat, almost choking 
him. Then he was running, sprint- 
ing across a stretch of open grass, 
leaping up the embankment to the 
causeway. He heard Sostelle at his 
side. 

“Roan, you’ll be killed! Both 
sides will fire their guns at you!” 

But Roan ran on toward the ap- 
proaching ITN detachment. The 
leader — a huge figure in ill-fitting 
blues — held up a hand, halted 
the column, brought a short-bar- 
reled power gun around . 

Then he threw it aside. 

“Roan! Chief!” he bellowed. 

“Askor! And Sidis!” 



154 



IF 




T hey came together and Roan 
seized the Minid’s broad shoul- 
ders in a wild embrace, shouting 
while Askor grinned so widely that 
everyone of his twenty-eight teeth 
showed. 

“Chief, we knew we’d find you,” 
he roared out. Sidis was looming 
then, his steel teeth glittering in 
the polyarc ligjht. 

“Askor and me come in here 
ready to blow this dump apart if 
we didn’t find you okay,” He 
clapped Roan on the back with his 
steel hook and Roan seized him, 
danced him around, while the 
troops standing by at the ready 
gaped and grinned. 

“I told that lunk-head you was 
okay.” Askor gripped Roan’s arm 
and pounded his back with a great, 
horny hand. 

“Gee, Boss, you look different,” 
Sidis said. “Your hair’s got gray 
and you got lines in your face . 
and you ain’t been eating good, 
neither. But to the Nine Hells with 
it! We’re together!” 

Roan laughed and listened to 
both men talk at once. Then other 
crewmen were crowding forward, 
and Roan caught a glimpse of a 
once-familiar face, now thin and 
dirty and streaked with tears. 

It was Trishinist. There was an 
iron collar around his neck to which 
a length of heavy chain was weld- 
ed. 

“I knew you big plug-uglies would 
come back,” Roan said. Sostelle was 
by his side, his tail wagging. “Didn’t 
I, Sostelle?” Roan demanded, blink- 
ing back an annoying film in his 
eyes. 



“Yes, Roan,” the dog said. “You 
knew.” 

“Chief, I guess maybe we better 
take a few minutes to straighten out 
these fellows coming out from the 
city,” Askor said. The dogs were 
marching across the causeway now, 
four abreast, advancing in defense 
of their masters. 

“Sostelle — can’t you stop them?” 
Roan asked. 

“No,” the dog said almost proud- 
ly. “The dogs will fight.” 

Then Askor was away, bawling 
orders, and Roan stood with Sidis 
under a tree that drifted lavender 
petals on them as the two columns 
met in fire and dust. 

Q unlight shifted suddenly past a 
O shattered beam and waked 
Roan. “It’s quiet,” he said to Desir- 
anne, who stood at the edge of the 
cavernous ruin of the old house, 
looking toward the city. She looked 
around, smiled, the sunlight misting 
in her hair. 

Askor appeared around the edge 
of the wall. “Looks like it’s over, 
Chief.” 

“That’s Sami!” Desiranne cried, 
pointing toward a dog that limped 
across the ruined square toward 
them. “It’s ... it was a dog I 
knew.” 

“My animals are overwhelmed,” 
Sami said. “Only twenty-three sur- 
vive, and all of those are injured. 
We can no longer fight.” His fur 
was singed and there was blood 
clotted at the side of his head, 
but he stood straight. 

“You put up a good scrap,” As- 
kor said approvingly. “You knocked 



EARTHBLOOD 



155 




off a couple dozen ITN’s and even 
nailed one or two of my boys.” 

“I request one hour’s time to per- 
mit my dogs to clean themselves 
and polish their brasses before we 
are put to death,” Sami said. “They 
wish to meet their end in propter 
fashion, and not as Masterless curs.” 

“Huh? Who said anything about 
killing you?” Askor said. 

“But we are sworn to defend to 
the death ...” 

“No“ Sami,” Desiranne put in 
softly. “I know your training, your 
loyalty. But the world is different 
now. I am different. So are you. 
Men and dogs must change or both 
be lost.” 

“What would you say to joining 
up,” Askor said. 

“Joining . ?” 

“The ITN,” Askor explained. “I 
need good fighters.” He looked at 
Roan. “Sorry, Chief. I guess this 
last year I kind of got a habit of 
talking like it was my show.” 

“It is,” Roan said. “You’ve 
earned it.” 

“If we hadn’t found Archaeop- 
teryx and our old crew cruising 
around near Alpha Four looking for 
us, we never would of made it. But 
what about signing up the dogs. 
Chief? You like the idea okay?” 

“Sure. They’re Terrans too, aren’t 
they?” 

The dog’s eyes gleamed. He 
straightened his back even more. 
“SirsJ^ My dogs and I accept your 
offer! We will fight well for Terra, 
Sirs!” Sami saluted and limped 
away. 

Sidis came up. “Boss, uh, the 
boys is kind of looking around a 



little in the city, if that’s okay. They 
been a long time in space, and, 
uh . .” 

“No unnecessaiy^ killing or des- 
truction,” Roan said. “I leave it to 
them to decide what’s necessary.” 
“Them poor Terries in the dump 
town,” Askor said. “They look 
worse than the Geeks back in that 
place, Tam bool. Chief. We give ’em 
some food and blasted down the 
gates so’s they could help themselves 
to some of the stuff that’s laying 
around in the fancy part of town. I 
got a idea we could sign on a few 
of them, too, after the fun’s over.” 
“Yeah, Boss,” Sidis said eagerly. 
“With a couple hundred of Trish- 
inist’s Gooks, and the dogs, and 
now those Terries, we got a nice- 
sized little navy shaping up. We 
could maybe even man two ships. 
What you got in mind for our next 
cruise?” 

Desiranne put her hand on Roan’s 
arm, and looked up at him anxious- 
ly. Roan covered her hand with his, 
covering the old finger wound. He 
shook his head. “I’m staying on 
Terra,” he said. 

Askor and Sidis stared at him. 
“This world needs every Man it 
can get,” Roan said. “The old equil- 
ibrium’s been shattered. If we leave 
them to their own devices they’ll die. 
The Lowers outnumber the Uppers 
a hundred to one — but they don’t 
know how to run a world. And if 
the automatic machinery isn’t pro- 
perly tended, they’ll all starve. 
They’ll starve soon, anyway, when 
the system breaks down completely. 
But I can help. I have to try.” 
Askor nodded. “Yeah . from 



156 



IF 




what I saw, there ain’t much hope 
for these Terries on their own.” 
“There still life in the old 
world,” Roan said. “Now that the 
blockade is broken, the word will 
spread. They’ll be coming, to get 
in on the spoils. But with a little 
time and luck, I can organize her 
defenses — enough to give her a 
chance.” 

Askor frowned. “Defenses? What 
about Archie? There ain’t many 
tubs in space can take her on.” 

“I can’t ask you to stay here,” 
Roan said. “For me, it’s different. 
I have a wife now. And in a few 
months I’ll have a son . ” 
Askor and Sidis looked at each 
other. “Uh . you know. Boss, 
it’s a funny thing,” Sidis said. “I 
feel at home here myself.” He waved 
a thick-fingered hand. “The air 
smells right, the sunlight, the trees 
— all that kind of stuff. I been 
thinking — ” 

“Uh, Chief,” Askor btoke in, “Til 
be back.” 

Roan looked after him. “I guess 
I’m a great disappointment to him. 
Married, settled down, no more 
raiding the space ways . ” 

“It ain’t that, Boss.” Sidis snap- 
ped the top off a tall wine bottle 
and occupied himself with swallow- 
ing. A big Gook named Gungle ap- 
peared at the door, grinned across 
at Roan. 

“Hey, Cap’n, what do you want 
to do with this Terry Admiral we 
got here? Askor said bring him 
along from Alpha for you to roast 
over a slow fire if you wanted to.” 
He tugged the chain in his hand 
and Trishinist stumbled in. 



4 4'Ooan! Dear lad,” he babbled. 

-Iv “If you’ve a heart, surely 
you’ll take a moment now to instruct 
these animals to release me.” 

Gungle jerked the chain. “Talks 
funny, don’t he, Cap’n?” 

“Maybe we should find a nice 
deep hole to put him in,” Roan said 
thoughtfully, studying the former 
officer. “But somehow the idea bores 
me. You may as well just shoot 
him.” 

“Roan — no! I’m far too valuable 
to you!” 

“He’s all the time talking about 
something he knows, Cap’n,” Gun- 
gle explained. “Said you wouldn’t 
never find out if we was to blow 
a hole in him.” 

“Yes, Roan,” Trishinist gasped. 
“Only set me free — with a stout 
vessel, of course — one of the 
flagship’s lifeboats will serve nicely 
— and an adequate supply of pro- 
visions — and perhaps just a few 
small ingots of Terran gold to help 
me make a new start — and I’ll tell 
you something that will astonish 
you!” 

“Go ahead,” Roan said. 

“But first, your promise.” 

Gurgle gave the chain a sharp 
tug. “Tell it,” he growled. 

Trishinist bleated. “Your word, 
Roan — ” 

“I guess I might as well go ahead 
and plug him, Cap’n,” Gungle said 
apologetically, tugging at his pistol. 
“I shudn’t of bothered you.” He 
turned on the cowering man. 

“I’ll speak!” Trishinist bleated. 
“And throw myself on your mercy, 
Roan. I have faith in your sense 
of honor, dear lad!”

Roan yawned. 

“You’re a Terran!” Trishinist 
screeched. “Yes, of the Pure Strain. 
The ancient strain! There was a 
ship — oh, old, old, it was. Roan! 
Hulled in Deep Space by a rock 
half as big as a lifeboat, and drift- 
ing through space and centuries — 
until I found it. There was the body 
of a Man, frozen in an instant as 
the rock opened her decks to space. 
They took from his body the frozen 
germ cells, and at my order — my 
order. Roan — our finest techni- 
cians thawed them, and induced 
maturation! And then — but the 
you you know ...” He stared 
at Roan, his mouth hanging open, 
his eyes pleading. 

“His name was Admiral Stuart 
Murdoch,” Roan said. “He died 
sixteen thousand years ago.” 

4 4^^hen — you knew it.” Trishin- 
A ist’s face went gray. 

“I didn’t know the whole story. 
Tell me, Trishinist, if I let you go, 
will you settle down here on Terra 
and live a useful life?” 

“Live? Life? the former Admiral 
straightened. “Roan, I’ll be a model 
citizen, I swear it. Oh, I’di tired, 
tired! Of killing, and struggle, and 
hate! I want to rest now. I’ll till 
a plot of land — Terran soil — and 
marry a Terran woman, raise a 
family. I want* ... I want to be 
loved. 

“Gripes,” Gungle said. 

“Perhaps he does,” Desiranne 
said. “We’re all having a new birth 
now.” She leaned heavUy oh Roan, 
reminding him of the new life with- 
in her. 



“Get out,” Roan said to him. 
“And if you betray me. I’ll find 
you. Wherever you are.” 

“Gee, Cap’n,” Gungle said dis- 
gustedly. He dropped the chain 
and Trishinist caught it up, darted 
from the room. Roan heard a yell, 
then the scamper of retreating feet. 
Askor came in, grinning. 

“I figured you’d let him go. 
Chief. And, uh, now I got some- 
thing to show you.” 

He turned, beckoned. A* girl ap- 
peared in the doorway, smiling shy- 
ly. She was small, pretty, obviously 
Terran. She was dressed in soft- 
colored garment from the Gallian 
World, and she held a baby in her 
arms. Askor went to her, put a pro- 
tective hand on her shoulder, led 
her to Roan. A fat, three month- 
old face looked up at Roan, sud- 
denly smiled a half-familiar smUe. 
“My kid,” Askor said proudly. 
Roan blinked. 

“Me and CyrDlia,” Askor went 
on, grinning. “I, uh, kind of took 
her along when me and Sidis left 
here. Chief. We was in kind of a 
hurry, but I seen her and you 
know ...” 

“You took her with you?” Roan 
took the baby. He was solid, heavy, 
with the round face of a Minid 
and the pert nose of his mother. 
“Then — this means — ” 
“Yeah,” Askor said. “I guess that 
proves even a Gook’s got a little 
Earthblood, huh? I want to stay 
here. Chief. With you. ’’And the 
rest of the boys too. You need us 
here. Terra needs us to start her 
new navy. And ever since Roan was 
born — ” Askor blushed.

“We named him for you, Sir,” 
Cyrillia said in a soft voice. 

“Hell’s hull, Chief — all the 
boys are tired of this shipboard life. 
They all want to get a nice Terrie 
gal and settle down. We’ll keep 
Archie ship-shape.” 

“There are plenty of ships,” Roan 
said, through a smile that felt as 
large and silly as Askor’s” 

T he first star came out. But it 
wasn’t somewhere to go. It was 
just a decoration. 

Roan held Desiranne’s hand in 
his and saw that she was looking 
down the grassy- hillside to the city, 
where fire winked and glimmered 
among the dark buildings. Echoes 
of grating laughter, shouts, the tune- 
less counterpoints of drunken looters 
sounded. 

“Tears for your city?” Roan ask- 
ed his wife, feeling them fall on 
his hand. 

“Only for the strangeness of it 
all, the difference,” she said softly, 
and then almost shouted, “No! 
Let them destroy it, root out all 
the evil. And then we start over.” 
“Still ... I could weep myself 
for all that history. The ancient 
things burning there, the treasures 
of Terran art, the heritage of Terra’s 
greatness.” 

Desiranne touched his cheek. “Oh, 
Roan, how you must ache for it! 
The Terra you came so far for, 
that you spent your youth to find. 
The Terra that no longer existed.” 
“No.” Roan helped Desiranne to 
her feet, looking out with her over 
the city, into the night. “I learned 
something. If what you want doesn’t 



exist, you create it. Terra’s past is 
lost forever. Now she has only the 
future. We’ll make the future. You 
and me — and our friends out 
there!” END

Dear Editor : 

Congratulations! You have just 
received my nomination for the best 
science-fiction magazine of 1965 (or 
any other year, for that matter). 

Anyone who can publish in the 
same issue the conclusion of Hein- 
lein’s best novel yet, the beginning 
of another world-beater serial, 
PLUS the best collection of short 
stories and novelettes anywhere de- 
serves the Hugo. Maybe they should 
create another category, the editor 
who has done the most to promote 
better science fiction. If they do, 
the only person who could honestly 
accept it would be you, Mr. Pohl. 

On the minus side however, is the 
juvenile artwork displayed on the 
covers of your magazines. So far, 
only Galaxy has had any decent 
covers. The ones on W. O. T. and 
If give the prospective buyer a false 
impression of what sf is about. I 
feel that the cover artwork should 
be equal to, if not better than, the 
interior artwork. 

Now for the analyzation. Starting 
with the past three issues (Febru- 
ary). The Heinlein serial was, of 
course, the best part of the entire 
magazine. Coming in second, was C. 
C. MacApp, who I must admit Pm 
partial to. For the short, short story 



of the new year. Build We Musty 
takes the prize. Next, R. A. Laffer- 
ty with the Nine Hundred Grand- 
mothers, Please give us more of 
Lafferty’s work, which, although 
it is not very popular, is some of 
the best weird-type fiction written. 
Booby prize goes to Not by Sea 
which never should have seen print. 

In the March issue, once again 
the Master comes thru with the 
No. 1 story, followed closely by Dam 
Nuisance, One of my favorite 
authors (you have a different one 
of them every issue) John Brunner 
came through with a rousing good 
story, with a feminine hero for a 
change. Neither of the short stories 
were worth the time it took to 
read them. 

I hate to seem monotonous but 
once again the writer who must be 
the best all-time writer of sf ever, 
came through with the Hugo winner 
for ^66 for long fiction. I am re- 
ferring to The Moon Is a Harsh 
Mistress. The new serial by Laumer 
and Brown (just who the heck is 
Rosel G. Brown, anyway?) was 
good and promises to be consistent- 
ly so. Castles in Space was unusual 
and was very enjoyable. E. Clayton 
McCarty who writes like no one 
else, with tenderness, understand- 



160 





ing and warmth, (plus a t 5 rpewriter) 
came throug'h with another enjoy- 
able tale, his third in a row for 
you. No comment on Garrett 
Brown’s story, let’s just say that 
you must have had very i>oor pick- 
ings that month. To sum it up, at 
least five were very goods, three 
goods and about two strike-outs. A 
very commendable record. 

Before I end, I would like to 
air one of my biggest gripes that 1 
have about your group of maga- 
zines. You, Mr. Pohl, are one of 
the finest writers of this generation. 
Yet in the last two or three years, 
you have not written anything that 
would be considered even fair for 
a writer of your calibre. The works 
of yours that I have read are all 
reprints. Perhaps it is the fact 
that you have three magazines to 
edit that prevents you from gar- 
nering the yearly crop of Hugos. 
I do wish that you would find time 
to write some more stories that are 
the sequel of say, Space MerchanU\ 
or a novelette like The Abominable 
Earthman. 

Keep up the good work. — Drake 
Maynard, 2509 Columbine Lane, 
Burlington, North Carolina. 27215. 
P.S. A while ago, someone read one 
of my letters and wrote to me. I 
seem to have lost his address and 
would appreciate it if you would 
publish this' letter so he could write 
me again to send me his address.

Dear Editor: 

I have noticed in your recent 
issue of If some comments on the 
desirability of advertisements in 
your magazine. Unfortunately, 
science-fiction fans have a poor un- 
derstanding of the advertising busi- 
ness. I have been in the advertising 
business for over twenty years and 



perhaps I can straighten out their 
misconceptions. 

First of all, science-fiction fans 
think it is impossible to get adver- 
tisements from technical and scien- 
tific firms in science-fiction maga- 
zines. It is not possible. It is true 
that a few gimcrack outfits will 
advertise in s-f magazines, ' but 
authentic scientific firms do not 
need to. The reason is simply that 
most of these firms advertise in pro- 
fessional publications where they 
are assured that their ad will be 
read by the person for whom it is 
intended. There are almost twenty 
thousand of these publications, and 
none of them ever appear on the 
newsstands. Some of them are is- 
sued every two weeks and many 
of them are an inch thick. They also 
deliver up-to-the-minute news on the 
profession at which they are aimed. 
In other words, they are everything 
that the professional man needs. 

I realize that s-f fans want such 
ads in s-f magazines to add a touch 
of dignity while bringing in enough 
money to make the magazine better. 
And this brings up the question of 
whether they consider dignity more 
important than a better magazine. 
I am inclined to believe that they 
do. However, you cannot eat dignity. 
The writers and artists for the 
magazines can make more money if 
the magazine has advertising rev- 
enue. Obviously, with more money 
coming in, the publisher can afford 
to pay more. It is equally obvious 
that a magazine with an assured 
advertising income could eventually 
lower its cover price. AU of these 
would be good things. But you can 
only get them if you are willing 
to accept the presence of consumer 
advertising in the pages of the 
magazine. That means liquor ads. 



HUE & CRY 



161 




cig'arette ads, chewing gum ads, 
etc. You use there products, so why 
detest the need for advertising 
them? 

This brings us to the ever-present 
problem of display space. The ad- 
vertiser is just as concerned about 
this as the publisher of s-f maga- 
zines. The advertiser needs room 
to show his product, and there just 
is not sufficient room in the pres- 
ent digest size s-f mag. To correct 
this problem, I suggest that the 
s-f mags give serious consideration 
to the possibility of increasing their 
size to that of the Playboy type 
magazine. Large sizes have been 
tried, as I stated in my last let- 
ter. However, expense was not giv- 
en enough consideration. It was as- 
sumed by those who tried it that 
the large size might automatically 
bring in enough readers to support 
the magarine in that size printed 
on slick paper. 

From my point of view, a slick 
paper magazine in the s-f field is 
not worthy of consideration, be- 
cause it could never pay for itself. I 
suggest an approximately S'^xlO^' 
format, saddle stitched and printed 
on pulp paper. Half-page inside 
illustrations would be sufficient and 
the cover illustration need not cover 
the whole page. A publication of 
this size would be more attractive 
to the potential advertiser than the 
present size. S-f magazines have 
changed their formats three times 
in the past forty years. There is 
no reason why they cannot change 
again. — D. Bruce Berry, 4554

Dear Editor: 

Several of my friends and I were 
wondering about NICAP — where is 



national headquarters, how does one 
join and related information. Could 
you at If do an editorial on 
NICAP? — Leroy M. Webb, P.O. 
Box 178, Yelm, Washington. 

% The National Investigations Com- 
mittee on Aerial Phenomena, largest 
(and most easily comprehended!) of 
the groups interested in UFOs, is 
located at 1536 Connecticut Ave- 
nue NW, Washington 36, D.C. Far 
as we know, membership is open to 
any interested party. Their princi- 
pal function is to serve as a sort 
of clearing house for reports of un- 
explained sightings; they also pub- 
lish books and periodicals about 
them, attempt to investigate as 
many sightings as possible, etc. — 
Editor, 

Dear Editor: 

Anyone who had a rejected 
science-fiction story sent to a pub- 
lisher, and anyone who would like 
to write a story or has some good 
ideas for stories, should write to 
me if they would like to join the 
club called the S.F.W.O. (Science 
Fiction Writers Organization). 

Anyone who is interested, write 
me a letter and I will send them 
a letter on what it is all about.

ing, Minnesota. 

# ThaVs about it for another 
month. This month's ‘‘First" is A. 
A. Walde with — we think you'll 
agree! — an unusual contribution, 
not only because of its story quali- 
ties but because of its length (Most 
beginning writers stick to very short 
pieces — but as you see, it's not 
essential ! ) 

Next month? Hal Clement's back, 
with a story called The Foundling 
Stars. Need we say more?
