We’re Looking For People 
Who Like To Draw! 

by Albert Dome 

FAMOUS MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATOR 




D O YOU LIKE TO DRAW? If yOU do 

— America’s 12 Most Famous 
Artists are looking for you . We want 
you to test your art talent ! 

Too many persons miss a won- 
derful career in art — 
simply because they 
don’t think they have 
talent. But my colleagues 
and I have helped thou- 
sands of people get 
started. Like these— 

Don Smith lives in 
New Orleans. Three 
years ago Don knew 
nothing about art — even 
doubted he had talent. 

Today, he is an illus- 
trator with a leading advertising 
agency in the South — and has a 
future as big as he wants to make it. 

John Busketta is another. He 
was a pipe-fitter’s helper with a big 
gas company — until he decided to 
do something about his urge to 
draw. He still works for the same 
company — but as an artist in the 
advertising department. At a big 
increase in pay ! 

Don Golemba of Detroit stepped 
up from railroad worker to the 
styling department of a major auto- 
mobile company. Now he helps 
design new car models ! 

A salesgirl in West Virginia 
who liked to draw got a job as an 
artist, later became advertising 



manager of the best store in 
Charleston. A married man with 
three children — unhappy in a dead- 
end job — switched to a great new 
career in art. Now he’s one of 
the happiest men you’ll 
ever meet! 

How about you? 
Wouldn’t you like to 
trade places with these 
happy artists? 

We want to help you 
find out if you have the 
talent for a fascinating 
money-making art ca- 
reer (part time or full 
time). We’ll be glad to 
send you our remarkably 
revealing 8-page talent test. Thou- 
sands of pieople formerly paid SI 
for this test. But now we’ll .send it 
to you free — if you sincerely like to 
draw. No obligation on your part. 
But act at once. Simply mail the 
coupon provided below.

LOOK 

S OME months back, I related 
the unsettling experience of 
a writer who found himself trudg- 
ing up the subway steps behind 
two men. The first exclaimed that 
the Sun had been out when they 
got aboard . and here it was 
pouring downtown! “Well,” said 
the other, “it’s better than noth- 
ing.” 

I speculated on the possibility 
that the second speaker was an 
alien from a world without 
weather, or perhaps from an un- 
known part of Earth where 
weather was optional. Then I had 
to drop the subject, having run 
out of data. 

That’s not so any longer and 
I can’t say I’m happy it isn’t. All 
of it adds up to the conclusion 
that there are indeed Aliens 
Among Us. 

No, it’s not a matter of looking 
for slight scars where antennae 
have been neatly lopped off, signs 
of third eyes, fingers grafted onto 
tentacles, legs that bend back- 
ward at the knee, or where the 
knee should be, or watching for 
“people” to emerge from burrows 
in Central Park. 

Even we, with our necessarily 
less advanced science, would be 
cleverer than that. The give- 

4 



NOW! 

aways, as you can see, can’t be 
that easily detected. 

Then must we remain dupes? 
Not at all! 

One thing that can’t be shucked 
very readily is conditioning. 
You’ve had one example. Did the 
“man” who betrayed himself get 
flustered and fear exposure? I 
doubt it; we’re accustomed to 
laugh off such flubs as unthinking 
answers or slips of the tongue, 
and any well-trained scout would 
exploit that human trait. 

But no longer! Regard this 
blooper: A letter to a newspaper 
blamed subway accidents on the 
“fact” that, for the past few 
years, transport workers have 
had no working conditions at all! 

Somebody (or something), I’ll 
wager, is going to get recalled and 
made an example of. Besides 
shooting off his mouth, if that is 
what it is, he falsified in our 
terms, which are the ones that 
count, for if there’s anything the 
TWU has, it’s working condi- 
tions. 

I admit that I was bothered by 
both these instances being associ- 
ated with the subway. Now, con- 
sidering the others at hand, I 
think it’s only coincidence. 

In my first editorial job, I was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



jolted by this astonishing sen- 
tence: “Gibbering idiotically, his 
bare feet padded across the floor.” 
Naturally, I thought it was 
merely a dangling participle— but 
gibbering feet aren’t so impos- 
sible when you remember that 
crickets communicate, or what- 
ever they do, by rubbing their 
hind legs together. 

Then there’s the now defunct 
(or recalled) Broadway charac- 
ter who enthused over a movie: 
“Don’t miss it if you can!” 

Translating that is as frustrat- 
ing as staring at the optical-illu- 
sion blocks — just when you think 
you have it, the whole meaning 
turns upside down. I think it may 
indicate a desperate lack of free 
will. But it may be exactly the 
opposite ... or something else en- 
tirely that we can’t even ima- 
gine. 

Sam Goldwyn’s famous — well, 
Goldwynisms could stand deci- 
phering. For example: “I’ll be- 
lieve in color TV when I see it in 
black and white.” Anybody who 
sees color in black and white 
could be seeing black and white 
in color! 

He is also reported to have 
said: “These guys who are work- 
ing on the atom bomb must be 
crazy. Don’t they know they’re 
playing with dynamite?” I sense 
contempt here, a hint of alien 
weapons so powerful that even 
our most horrible are like blast- 



ing powder by comparison. 

He denies authorship of these 
and other — well, Goldwynisms. I 
believe him, if only because no 
scout would be allowed to goof 
so often. 

Or is that more of the same 
contempt? After a recent TV 
commercial, I can understand 
such superiority: Super Anahist, 
the anouncer said, gets rid of 
sniffles and red, swollen eyes. If 
we had detachable eyes, I guess 
we’d be feeling pretty superior, 
too, eh? 

I think I’m on the right track 
in decoding these weird glimpses 
of outworld conditioning, but 
there are at least two complica- 
tions : 

— It sounds as if we’re playing 
unwitting host to more than one 
alien species. 

— Some human beings do have 
tangled tongues, like the Rev. 
Spooner’s “Pardon me, madam; 
you’re occupewing the wrong pie. 
I’ll sew you to another sheet.” 
That doesn’t make detection a bit 
easier. 

But what I’m really worried 
about is a quote from The Pocket 
Book of Boners, an omnibus of 
(supposedly) schoolboy howlers: 

Name a noted foreigner assisting 
the eoionisls in the Kevolutionary 
War. 

God. 

Now what in the name of 
Heaven does that mean?

for Dinosaur 



N o, MR. SELIGMAN, I 
won’t take you hunting 
late-Mesozoic dinosaur. 
Why not? How much d’you 
weigh? A hundred and thirty? 
Let’s see, that’s under ten stone, 
which is my lower limit. 



I’ll take you to any period in 
the Cenozoic. I’ll get you a shot 
at an entelodont or a titanothere 
or a uintathere. The’ve all got fine 
heads. 

I’ll even stretch a point and 
take you to the Pleistocene, where 



A GUN FOR DINOSAUR

you can try for one of the mam- 
moths or the mastodon. 

I’ll take you back to the Tri- 
assic where you can shoot one of 
the smaller ancestral dinosaur. 

But I will not — will jolly well 
not — take you to the Jurassic or 
Cretaceous. You’re just too small. 

No offense, of course. 

What’s your weight got to do 
with it? 

Look here, old boy, what did 
you think you were going to shoot 
them with? 

You hadn’t thought, eh? 

Vj^ELL, sit there a minute . 
” Here you are, my own pri- 
vate gun for that work, a Conti- 
nental .600. Does look like a shot- 
gun, doesn’t it? But it’s rifled, as 
you can see by looking through 
the barrels. Shoots a pair of .600 
nitro express cartridges the size of 
bananas; weighs fourteen and a 
half pounds and has a muzzle 
energy of over seven thousand 
foot-pounds. Costs fourteen hun- 
dred and fifty dollars. Lot of 
money for a gun, what? 

I have some spares I rent to the 
sahibs. Designed for knocking 
down elephant. Not just wound- 
ing them, knocking them base- 
over-apex. That’s why they don’t 
make guns like this in America, 
though I suppose they will if 
hunting parties keep going back 
in time through Prochaska’s 
machine. 



I’ve been guiding hunting par- 
ties for twenty years. Guided ’em 
in Africa until the game gave out 
there except on the preserves. 
That just about ended the world’s 
real big-game hunting. 

My point is, all that time I’ve 
never known a man your size who 
could handle the six-nought- 
nought. It knocks ’em over. Even 
when they stay on their feet, they 
get so scared of the bloody can- 
non after a few shots that they 
flinch. Can’t hit an elephant at 
spitting range. And they find the 
gun too heavy to drag around 
rough Mesozoic country. Wears 
’em out. 

It’s true, lots of people have 
killed elephant with lighter guns: 
the .500, .475, and .465 doubles, 
for instance, or even .375 mag- 
num repeaters. The difference is 
that with a .375 you have to hit 
something vital, preferably the 
heart, and can’t depend on simple 
shock-power. 

An elephant weighs — let’s see 
— four to six tons. You’re plan- 
ning to shoot reptiles weighing 
two or three times as much as an 
elephant and with much greater 
tenacity of life. That’s why the 
syndicate decided to take no more 
people dinosaur - hunting unless 
they could handle the .600. We 
learned the hard way, as you 
Americans say. There were some 
unfortunate incidents. 

I’ll tell you, Mr. Seligmari. It’s 



8 



GAIAXV SCIENCE FICTION 



after seventeen hundred. Time I 
closed the office. Why don’t we 
stop at the bar on our way out 
while I tell you the story? 

¥ T WAS about the Raja’s and 
my fifth safari. The Raja? Oh, 
he’s the Aiyar half of Rivers & 
Aiyar. I call him the Raja be- 
cause he’s the hereditary monarch 
of Janpur. Means nothing now- 
adays, of course. Knew him in 
India and ran into him in New 
York running the Indian tourist 
agency. That dark chap in the 
photograph on my office wall, the 
one with his foot on the dead 
saber-tooth. 

Well, the Raja was fed up with 
handing out brochures about the 
Taj Mahal and wanted to do a bit 
of hunting again. I was at loose 
ends when we heard of Professor 
Prochaska’s time machine at 
Washington University. 

Where is the Raja? Out on 
safari in the early Oligocene, after 
titanothere, while I run the office. 
We take turn about now, but the 
first few times we went out to- 
gether. 

Anyhow, we caught the next 
plane to St. Louis. To our morti- 
fication, we found we weren’t the 
first. 

Lord, no! There were other 
hunting guides and no end of sci- 
entists, each with his own idea of 
the right use for the machine. 

We scraped off the historians 



and archeologists right at the 
start. 

Seems the bloody machine 
won’t work for periods more re- 
cent than 100,000 years ago. 
From there, up to about a billion 
years. 

Why? Oh, I’m no four-dimen- 
sional thinker, but as I understand 
it, if people could go back to a 
more recent time, their actions 
would affect our own history, 
which would be a paradox or con- 
tradiction of facts. Can’t have that 
in a well-run universe. But before 
100,000 B.C., more or less, the 
actions of the expeditions are lost 
in the stream of time before hu- 
man history begins. At that, once 
a stretch of past time has been 
used, say the month of January, 
one million B.C., you can’t use 
that stretch over again by sending 
another party into it. Paradoxes 
again. 

But the professor isn’t wor- 
ried; with a billion years to ex- 
ploit, he won’t soon run out of 
eras. 

Another limitation of the ma- 
chine is the matter of size. For 
technical reasons, Prochaska had 
to build the transition chamber 
just big enough to hold four men 
with their personal gear, plus the 
chamber-wallah. Larger parties 
have to be sent through in relays. 
That means, you see, it’s not prac- 
tical to take jeeps, boats, aircraft, 
or other powered vehicles. 



A GUN FOR DINOSAUR

O N THE other hand, since 
you’re going to periods with- 
out human beings, there’s no 
whistling up a hundred native 
bearers to trot along with your 
gear on their heads. So we usu- 
ally take a train of asses — burros, 
they call them here. Most periods 
have enough natural forage to get 
you where you want to go. 

As I say, everybody had his 
own idea for using the machine. 
The scientists looked down their 
noses at us hunters and said it 
would be a crime to waste the 
machine’s time pandering to our 
sadistic amusements. 

We brought up another angle. 
The machine cost a cool thirty 
million. I understand this came 
from the Rockefeller Board and 
such people, but that only ac- 
counted for the original cost, not 
the cost of operation. And the 
thing uses fantastic amounts of 
power. Most of the scientists’ 
projects, while worthy as worthy 
could be, were run on a shoe- 
string, financially speaking. 

Now we guides catered to 
people with money, a species with 
which America seems overstocked. 
No offense, old boy. Most of these 
could afford a substantial fee for 
passing through the machine to 
the past. Thus we could help 
finance the operation of the ma- 
chine for scientific purposes, pro- 
vided we got a fair share of its 
time. 



Won’t go into the details, but in 
the end the guides formed a syn- 
dicate of eight members, one 
member being the partnership of 
Rivers & Aiyar, to apportion the 
machine’s time. 

We had rush business from the 
start. Our wives — the Raja’s and 
mine — raised bloody hell with us. • 

They’d hoped when the big game 
gave out they’d never have to 
share us with lions and things 
again, but you know how women 
are. Can’t realize hunting’s not 
really dangerous if you keep your 
head and take precautions. 

O N THE fifth expedition, we 
had two sahibs to wet-nurse : 
both Americans in their thirties, 
both physically sound, and both 
solvent. Otherwise they were as 
different as different can be. 

Courtney James was what you 
chaps call a playboy: a rich 
young man from New York who’d 
always had his own way and 
didn’t see why that agreeable con- 
dition shouldn’t continue. A big 
bloke, almost as big as I am; 
handsome in a florid way, but be- 
ginning to run to fat. He was on 
his fourth wife, and when he 
showed up at the office with a 
blonde with “model” written all • 
over her, I assumed this was the 
fourth Mrs. James. 

“Miss Bertram,” she corrected ^ 
me, with an embarrassed giggle. ^ 
“She’s not my wife,” James ex- 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



plained. “My wife is in Mexico, I 
think, getting a divorce. But 
Bunny here would like to go 
along — ” 

“Sorry,” I said, “we don’t take 
ladies. At least not to the late 
Mesozoic.” 

This wasn’t strictly true, but I 
felt we were running enough risks, 
going after a little-known fauna, 
without dragging in people’s do- 
mestic entanglements. Nothing 
against sex, you understand. Mar- 
velous institution and all that, but 
not where it interferes with my 
living. 

“Oh, nonsense,” said James. “If 
she wants to go, she’ll go. She skis 
and flies my airplane, so why 
shouldn’t she — ” 

“Against the firm’s policy.” 

“She can keep out of the way 
when we run up against the dan- 
gerous ones.” 

“No, sorry.” 

“Damn it,” said he, getting red. 
“After all, I’m paying you a goodly 
sum and I’m entitled to take who 
I please.” 

“You can’t hire me to do any- 
thing against my best judgment,” 
I said. “If that’s how you feel, get 
another guide.” 

“All right, I will. And I’ll tell all 
my friends you’re a goddamn — ” 
Well, he said a lot of things I 
won’t repeat. It ended with my 
telling him to get out of the office 
or I’d throw him out. 

I was sitting in the office think- 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



ing sadly of all that lovely money 
James would have paid me if I 
hadn’t been so stiff-necked, when 
in came my other lamb, one 
August Holtzinger. This was a 
little slim pale chap with glasses, 
polite and formal where the other 
had been breezily self-confident 
to the point of obnoxiousness. 

Holtzinger sat on the edge of 
his chair and said: “Uh — Mr. 
Rivers, I don’t want you to think 
I’m here under false pretenses. 
I’m really not much of an out- 
doorsman and I’ll probably be 
scared to death when I see a real 
dinosaur. But I’m determined to 
hang a dinosaur head over my 
fireplace or die in the attempt.” 
“Most of us are frightened at 
first,” I soothed him, and little 
by little I got the story out of him. 

W HILE James had always 
been wallowing in money, 
Holtzinger was a local product 
who’d only lately come into the 
real thing. He’d had a little busi- 
ness here in' St. Louis and just 
about made ends meet when an 
uncle cashed in his chips some- 
where and left little Augie the 
pile. 

He’d never been married but 
had a fiancee. He was building a 
big house, and when it was fin- 
ished, they’d be married and 
move into it. And one furnishing 
he demanded was a ceratopsian 
head over the fireplace. Those are 

11 



the ones with the big horned 
heads with a parrot-beak and frill 
over the neck, you know. You 
have to think twice about collect- 
ing them, because if you put a 
seven-foot triceratojss head into a 
small living room, there’s apt to 
be no room left for anything else. 

We were talking about this 
when in came a girl, a small girl 
in her twenties, quite ordinary- 
looking, and crying. 

“Augie!” she wept. “You can’t! 
You mustn’t! You’ll be killed!” 
She grabbed him round and said 
to me: “Mr. Rivers, you mustn’t 
take him! He’s all I’ve got! He’ll 
never stand the hardships!” 

“My dear young lady,” I said, 
“I should hate to cause you dis- 
tress, but it’s up to Mr. Holtzinger 
to decide whether he wishes to re- 
tain my services.” 

“It’s no use, Claire,” said Holt- 
zinger. “I’m going, though I'll 
probably hate every minute of it.” 
“What’s that, old boy?” I asked. 
“If you hate it, why go? Did you 
lose a bet or something?” 

“No,” said Holtzinger. “It’s this 
way. Uh — I’m a completely undis- 
tinguished kind of guy. I’m not 
brilliant or big or strong or hand- 
some. I’m just an ordinary Mid- 
western small businessman. You 
never even notice me at Rotary 
luncheons, I fit in so perfectly. 
But that doesn’t say I’m satis- 
fied. I’ve always hankered to go 
to far places and do big things. 



I’d like to be a glamorous, adven- 
turous sort of guy. Like you, Mr. 
Rivers.” 

“Oh, come,” I protested. “Pro- 
fessional hunting may seem glam- 
orous to you, but to me it’s just 
a living.” 

E SHOOK his head. “Nope. 
You know what I mean. 
Well, now I’ve got this legacy, I 
could settle down to play bridge 
and golf the rest of my life and 
try to act like I wasn’t bored. But 
I’m determined to do something 
big for once. Since there’s no more 
real big-game hunting, I’m gonna 
shoot a dinosaur and hang his 
head over my mantel. I’ll never 
be happy otherwise.” 

Well, Holtzinger and his girl, 
whose name was Roche, argued, 
but he wouldn’t give in. She made 
me swear to take the best care 
of her Augie and departed, 
sniffling. 

When Holtzinger had left, who 
should come in but my vile- 
tempered friend Courtney James. 
He apologized for insulting me, 
though you could hardly say he 
groveled. 

“I don’t actually have a bad 
temper,” he said, “except when 
people won’t cooperate with me. 
Then I sometimes get mad. But 
so long as they’re cooperative, 
I’m not hard to get along with.” 

I knew that by “cooperate” he 
meant to do whatever Courtney 




12 



GALAXY SCIENCE fICTION 



James wanted, but I didn’t press 
the point. “How about Miss Bar- 
tram?” I asked. 

“We had a row,” he said. “I’m 
through with women. So if there’s 
no hard feelings, let’s go on from 
where we left off.” 

“Absolutely,” I agreed, business 
being business. 

The Raja and I decided to 
make it a joint safari to eighty- 
five million years ago: the early 
upper Cretaceous, or the middle 
Cretaceous, as some American 
geologists call it. It’s about the 
best period for dinosaur in Mis- 
souri. You’ll find some individual 
species a little larger in the late 
upper Cretaceous, but the period 
we were going to gives a wider 
variety. 

Now, as to our equipment, the 
Raja and I each had a Continen- 
tal .600 like the one I showed you 
and a few smaller guns. At this 
time, we hadn’t worked up much 
capital and had no spare .600s to 
rent. 

A UGUST HOLTZINGER said 
he would rent a gun, as he 
expected this to be his only safari 
and there was no point in spend- 
ing over a thousand dollars for a 
gun he’d shoot only a few times. 
But since we had no spare .600s, 
his choice was between buying 
one of those and renting one of 
our smaller pieces. 

We drove into the country to 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



let him try the .600. We set up a 
target. Holtzinger heaved up the 
gun as if it weighed a ton and 
let fly. He missed completely and 
the kick knocked him flat on his 
back with his legs in the air. 

He got up, looking paler than 
ever, and handed me back the 
gun, saying; “Uh — I think I’d bet- 
ter try something smaller.” 

When his shoulder stopped be- 
ing sore, I tried him out on the 
smaller rifles. He took a fancy to 
my Winchester 70, chambered for 
the .375 magnum cartridge. It’s 
an excellent all-round gun — 

What’s it like? A conventional 
magazine rifle with a Mauser-type 
bolt action. It’s perfect for the 
big cats and bears, but a little 
light for elephant and very defi- 
nitely light for dinosaur. I should 
never have given in, but I was in 
a hurry and it might have taken 
months to get him a new .600. 
They’re made to order, you know, 
and James was getting impatient. 
James already had a gun, a Hol- 
land & Holland .500 double ex- 
press. With 5700 foot-p)ounds of 
muzzle energy, it’s almost in a 
class with the .600. 

Both sahibs had done a bit of 
shooting, so I didn’t worry about 
their accuracy. Shooting dinosaur 
is not a matter of extreme accu- 
racy but of sound judgment and 
smooth coordination so you shan’t 
catch twigs in the mechanism of 
your gun, or fall into holes, or 

13 



climb a small tree the dinosaur 
can pluck you out of, or blow 
your guide’s head off. 

People used to hunting mam- 
mals sometimes try to shoot a 
dinosaur in the brain. That’s the 
silliest thing you can do, because 
dinosaur haven’t got any. To be 
exact, they have a little lump of 
tissue about the size of a tennis 
ball on the front end of their 
spines, and how are you going to 
hit that when it’s imbedded in a 
moving six-foot skull? 

The only safe rule with dino- 
saur is — always try for a heart 
shot. They have big hearts, over 
a hundred pounds in the largest 
species, and a couple of .600 slugs 
through the heart will kill them 
just as dead as a smaller beast. 
The problem is to get the slugs 
through that mountain of muscle 
and armor around it. 

Vjj^ELL, we appeared at Pro- 
” chaska’s laboratory one rainy 
morning; James and Holtzinger, 
the Raja and I, our herder Beau- 
regard Black, three helpers, a cook, 
and twelve jacks. Burros, that is. 

The transition chamber is a 
little cubbyhole the size of a small 
lift. My routine is for the men 
with the guns to go first in case a 
hungry theropod might be stand- 
ing in front of the machine when 
it arrived. So the two sahibs, the 
Raja and I crowded into the 
chamber with our guns and packs. 



The operator squeezed in after 
us, closed the door, and fiddled 
with his dials. He set the thing 
for April twenty-fourth, eighty- 
five million B.C., and pressed the 
red button. 

The lights went out, leaving 
the chamber lit by a little battery- 
op>erated lamp. James and Holt- 
zinger looked pretty green, but 
that may have been the dim light- 
ing. The Raja and I had been 
through all this before, so the 
vibration and vertigo didn’t 
bother us. 

I could see the little black 
hands of the dials spinning round, 
some slowly and some so fast they 
were a blur. Then they slowed 
down and stopped. The operator 
looked at his ground-level gauge 
and turned a handwheel that 
raised the chamber so it shouldn’t 
materialize underground. Then he 
pressed another button and the 
door slid open. 

No matter how often I do it, 
I get a frightful thrill out of step- 
ping into a bygone era. The oper- 
ator had raised the chamber a 
foot above ground level, so I 
jumped down, my gun ready. The 
others came after. We looked 
back at the chamber, a big shiny 
cube hanging in mid-air a foot off 
the ground, with this little lift- 
door in front. 

“Right-ho,” I told the chamber- 
wallah, and he closed the door. 
The chamber disappeared and 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



we looked around. The scene had- 
n’t changed from my last expedi- 
tion to this era, which had ended, 
in Cretaceous time, five days be- 
fore this one began. There weren’t 
any dinosaur in sight, nothing but 
lizards. 

TN THIS period, the chamber 
materializes on top of a rocky 
rise from which you can see in 
all directions as far as the haze 
will let you. 

To the west, you see the arm 
of the Kansas Sea that reaches 
across Missouri and the big 
swamp around the bayhead where 
the sauropods live. It used to be 
thought the sauropods became ex- 
tinct before the Cretaceous, but 
that’s not so. They were more 
limited in range because swamps 
and lagoons didn’t cover so much 
of the world, but there were 
plenty of them if you knew where 
to look. 

To the north is a low range 
that the Raja named the Janpur 
Hills after the little Indian king- 
dom his forebears had ruled. To 
the east, the land slopes up to a 
plateau, good for ceratopsians, 
while to the south is flat country 
with more sauropod swamps and 
lots of ornithopods : duckbills and 
iguanadonts. 

The finest thing about the 
Cretaceous is the climate: balmy, 
like the South Sea Islands, with 
little seasonal change, but not so 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



muggy as most Jurassic climates. 
We happened to be there in 
spring, with dwarf magnolias in 
bloom all over, but the air feels 
like spring almost any time of 
year. 

A thing about this landscape is 
that it combines a fairly high 
rainfall with an open type of 
vegetation-cover. That is^, the 
grasses hadn’t yet evolved to the 
point of forming solid carpets 
over all open ground, so the 
ground is thick with laurel, sassa- 
fras and other shrubs, with bare 
ground between. There are big 
thickets of palmettos and ferns. 
The trees round the hill are most- 
ly cycads, standing singly and in 
copses. Most people call them 
palms, . though my scientific 
friends tell me they’re not true 
palms. 

Down toward the Kansas Sea 
are more cycads and willows, 
while the uplands are covered 
with screw-pine and ginkos. 

Now I’m no bloody poet — the 
Raja writes the stuff, not me — 
but I can appreciate a beautiful 
scene. One of the helpers had 
come through the machine with 
two of the jacks and was pegging 
them out, and I was looking 
through the haze and sniffing the 
air, when a gun went off behind 
me — ban^! ban^! 

I turned round and there was 
Courtney James with his .500 
and an ornithomime legging it 

15 



for cover fifty yards away. The 
ornithomimes are medium-sized 
running dinosaurs, slender things 
with long necks and legs, like a 
cross between a lizard and an 
ostrich. This kind is about seven 
feet tall and weighs as much as a 
man. The beggar had wandered 
out of the nearest copse and 
James gave him both barrels. 
Missed. 

I was a bit upset, as trigger- 
happy sahibs are as much a men- 
ace as those who get panicky and 
freeze or bolt. I yelled: 

“Damn it, you idiot, I thought 
you weren’t to shoot without word 
from me!” 

“And who the hell are you to 
tell me when I’ll shoot my own 
gun?” he demanded. 

Vj^E HAD a rare old row until 
™ Holtzinger and the Raja got 
us calmed down. 

I explained: “Look here, Mr. 
James, I’ve got reasons. If you 
shoot off all your ammunition be- 
fore the trip’s over, your gun 
won’t be available in a pinch and 
it’s the only one of its caliber. 
Second, if you empty both barrels 
at an unimportant target, what 
would happen if a big theropod 
charged before you could reload? 
Finally, it’s not sporting to shoot 
everything in sight. I’ll shoot for 
meat, or for trophies, or to defend 
myself, but not just to hear the 
gun go off. If more people had 

16 



exercised moderation in killing, 
there’d still be decent sport in our 
own era. Understand?” 

“Yeah, I guess so,” he said. 
Mercurial sort of bloke. 

The rest of the party came 
through the machine and we 
pitched our camp a safe distance 
from the materializing place. Our 
first task was to get fresh meat. 
For a twenty-one-day safari like 
this, we calculate our food re- 
quirements closely so we can 
make out on tinned stuff and 
concentrates if we must, but we 
count on killing at least one piece 
of meat. When that’s butchered, 
we go on a short tour, stopping 
at four or five camping places to 
hunt and arriving back at base 
a few days before the chamber is 
due to appear. 

Holtzinger, as I said, wanted a 
ceratopsian head, any kind. James 
insisted on just one head : a tyran- 
nosaur. Then everybody’d think 
he’d shot the most dangerous 
game of all time. 

Fact is, the tyrannosaur’s over- 
rated. He’s more a carrion-eater 
than an active predator, though 
he’ll snap you up if he gets the 
chance. He’s less dangerous than 
some of the other theropods — 
the flesh-eaters — such as the big 
saurophagus of the Jurassic, or 
even the smaller gorgosaurus 
from the period we were in. But 
everybody’s read about the tyrant 
lizard and he does have the big- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gest head of the theropods. 

otte in our period isn’t the 
rex, which is later and a little 
bigger and more specialized. It’s 
the trionyches with the forelimbs 
not reduced to quite such little 
vestiges, though they’re too small 
for an5dhing but picking the 
brute’s teeth after a meal. 

When camp was pitched, we 
still had the afternoon, so the 
Raja and I took our sahibs on 
their first hunt. We already had 
a map of the local terrain from 
previous trips. 

The Raja and I have worked 
out a system for dinosaur hunting. 
We split into two groups of two 
men and walk parallel from 
twenty to forty yards apart. Each 
group consists of one sahib in 
front and one guide following and 
telling the sahib where to go. 

We tell the sahibs we put them 
in front so they shall have first 
shot, which is true, but another 
reason is they’re always tripping 
and falling with their guns 
cocked, and if the guide were in 
front, he’d get shot. 

The reason for two groups is 
that if a dinosaur starts for one, 
the other gets a good heart shot 
from the side. 

A S WE walked, there was the 
usual rustle of lizards scut- 
tling out of the way: little fellows, 
quick as a flash and colored like 
all the jewels in Tiffany’s, and 



big gray ones that hiss and plod 
off. There were tortoises and a 
few little snakes. Birds with beaks 
full of teeth flapped off squawk- 
ing. And always that marvelous 
mild Cretaceous air. Makes a 
chap want to take his clothes off 
and dance with vine-leaves in his 
hair, if you know what I mean. 
Not that I’d ever do such a thing, 
you understand. 

Our sahibs soon found that 
Mesozoic country is cut up into 
millions of nullahs — gullies, you’d 
call them. Walking is one long 
scramble, up and down, up and 
down. 

We’d been scrambling for an 
hour and the sahibs were soaked 
with sweat and had their tongues 
hanging out, when the Raja 
whistled. He’d spotted a group 
of bonehead feeding on cycad 
shoots. 

These are the troodonts, small 
ornithopods about the size of 
men with a bulge on top of 
their heads that makes them look 
quite intelligent. Means nothing, 
because the bulge is solid bone 
and the brain is as small as in 
other dinosaur, hence the name. 
The males butt each other with 
these heads in fighting over the 
females. They would drop down 
to all fours, munch a shoot, then 
stand up and look round. They’re 
warier than most dinosaur be- 
cause they’re the favorite food of- 
the big theropods. 



A CUN FOR DINOSAUR 



17 



People sometimes assume that 
because dinosaur are so stupid, 
their senses must be dim, but it’s 
not so. Some, like the sauropods, 
are pretty dim-sensed, but most 
have good smell and eyesight and 
fair hearing. Their weakness is 
that, having no minds, they have 
no memories; hence, out of sight, 
out of mind. When a big theropod 
comes slavering after you, your 
best defense is to hide in a nullah 
or behind a bush, and if he can 
neither see nor smell you, he’ll 
just forget all about you and 
wander off. 

We sneaked up behind a patch 
of palmetto downwind from the 
bonehead. I whispered to James: 
“You’ve had a shot already today. 
Hold your fire until Holtzinger 
shoots and then shoot only if he 
misses or if the beast is getting 
away wounded.” 

“Uh-huh,” said James and we 
separated, he with the Raja and 
Holtzinger with me. This got 
to be our regular arrangement. 
James and I got on each other’s 
nerves, but the Raja, once you 
forget that Oriental-potentate rot, 
is a friendly, sentimental sort of 
bloke nobody can help liking. 

Well, we crawled round the 
palmetto patch on opposite sides 
and Holtzinger got up to shoot. 
You daren’t shoot a heavy-caliber 
rifle prone. There’s not enough 
give and the kick can break your 
shoulder. 

18 



TJOLTZINGER sighted round 
-^-^the last few fronds of pal- 
metto. I saw his barrel wobbling 
and weaving and then off went 
James’s gun, both barrels again. 
The biggest bonehead went down, 
rolling and thrashing, and the 
others ran on their hindlegs in 
great leaps, their heads jerking 
and their tails sticking up behind. 

“Put your gun on safety,” I 
said to Holtzinger, who’d started 
forward. By the time we got to 
the bonehead, James was stand- 
ing over it, breaking open his 
gun and blowing out the barrels. 
He looked as smug as if he’d in- 
herited another million and he 
was asking the Raja to take his 
picture with his foot on the game. 
His first shot had been excellent, 
right through the heart. His sec- 
ond had missed because the first 
knocked the beast down. James 
couldn’t resist that second shot 
even when there was nothing to 
shoot at. 

I said: “I thought you were to 
give Holtzinger first shot.” 

“Hell, I waited,” he said, “and 
he took so long, I thought some- 
thing must have gone wrong. If 
we stood around long enough, 
they’d see us or smell us.” 

There was something in what 
he said, but his way of saying it 
got me angry. I said: “If that 
sort of thing happens just once 
more, we’ll leave you in camp the 
next time we go out.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Now, gentlemen,” said the 
Raja. “After all, Reggie, these 
aren’t experienced hunters.” 
“What now?” asked Holtzinger. 
“Haul the beast back ourselves or 
send out the men?” 

“I think we can sling him un- 
der the pole,” I said. “He weighs 
under two hundred.” The pole 
was a telescoping aluminium car- 
rying pole I had in my pack, with 
yokes on the ends with sp>onge- 
rubber padding. I brought it along 
because in such eras you can’t 
always count on finding saplings 
strong enough for proper poles on 
the spot. 

The Raja and I cleaned our 
bonehead, to lighten him, and 
tied him to the pole. The flies be- 
gan to light on the offal by thou- 
sands. Scientists say they’re not 
true flies in the modern sense, 
but they look and act like them. 
There’s one conspicuous kind of 
carrion fly, a big four-winged in- 
sect with a distinctive deep note 
as it flies. 

’ I ■’HE REST of the afternoon, 
we sweated under that p>ole. 
We took turns about, one pair 
carrying the beast while the other 
two carried the guns. The lizards 
scuttled out of the way and the 
flies buzzed round the carcass. 

When we got to camp, it was 
nearly sunset. We felt as if we 
could eat the whole bonehead at 
one meal. The boys had the camp 

A CUN FOR DINOSAUR 



running smoothly, so we sat down 
for our tot of whiskey feeling like 
lords of creation while the cook 
broiled bonehead steaks. 

Holtzinger said: “Uh — if I kill 
a ceratopsian, how do we get his 
head back?” 

I explained : “If the ground per- 
mits, we lash it to the patent 
aluminium roller-frame and sled 
it in.” 

“How much does a head like 
that weigh?” he asked. 

“Depends on the age and the 
species,” I told him. “The biggest 
weigh over a ton, but most run 
between five hundred and a thou- 
sand pounds.” 

“And all the ground’s rough 
like today?” 

“Most of it. You see, it’s the 
combination of the open vegeta- 
tion cover and the high rainfall. 
Erosion is frightfully rapid.” 

“And who hauls the head on its 
little sled?” 

“Everybody with a hand. A 
big head would need every ounce 
of muscle in this party and even 
then we might not succeed. On 
such a job, there’s no place for 
side.” 

“Oh,” said Holtzinger. I could 
see him wondering whether a 
ceratopsian head would be worth 
the effort. 

The next couple of days, we 
trekked round the neighborhood. 
Nothing worth shooting; only a 
herd of fifty-odd ornithomimes 

19 



who went bounding off like a lot 
of bloody ballet dancers. Other- 
wise there were only the usual 
lizards and pterosaurs and birds 
and insects. There’s a big lace- 
winged fly that bites dinosaurs, 
so you can imagine its beak 
makes nothing of a human skin. 
One made Holtzinger leap into 
the air when it bit through his 
shirt. James joshed him about it, 
saying: “What’s all the fuss over 
one little bug?” 

The second night, during the 
Raja’s watch, James gave a yell 
that brought us all out of our tents 
with rifles. All that had happened 
was that a dinosaur tick had 
crawled in with him and started 
drilling into his armpit. Since it’s 
as big as your thumb even when 
it hasn’t fed, he was understand- 
ably startled. Luckily he got it 
before it had taken its pint of 
blood. He’d pulled Holtzinger’s 
leg pretty hard about the fly 
bite, so now Holtzinger repeated : 
“What’s all the fuss over one 
little bug, buddy?” 

James squashed the tick under- 
foot and grunted. He didn’t like 
being twitted with his own words. 

E PACKED up and started 
on our circuit. We meant to 
take them first to the borders of 
the sauropod swamp, more to see 
the wild-life than to collect any- 
thing. 

From where the transition 



chamber materializes, the sauro- 
pod swamp looks like a couple 
of hours’ walk, but it’s an all-day 
scramble. The first part is easy, 
as it’s downhill and the brush 
isn’t heavy. But as you get near 
the swamp, the cicads and willows 
grow so thickly, you have to worm 
your way among them. 

There was a sandy ridge on the 
border of the swamp that I led 
the party to, for it’s pretty bare 
of vegetation and affords a fine 
view. When we got to the ridge, 
the Sun was about to go down. 
A couple of crocs slipped off into 
the water. The sahibs were so 
exhausted, being soft yet, that 
they flopped down in the sand 
as if dead. 

The haze is thick round the 
swamp, so the Sun was deep red 
and distorted by the atmospheric 
layers — pinched in at various 
levels. There was a high layer 
of clouds reflecting the red and 
gold, too, so altogether it was 
something for the Raja to write 
one of his poems about. Only 
your modern poet prefers to 
write about a rainy day in a gar- 
bage dump. A few little pterosaur 
were wheeling overhead like bats, 
only they don’t flutter like bats. 
They swoop and soar after the 
big night-flying insects. 

Beauregard Black collected fire- 
wood and lit a fire. We’d started 
on our steaks, and that pagoda- 
shaped Sun was just slipping be- 




20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



low the horizon, and something 
back in the trees was making a 
noise like a rusty hinge, when a 
sauropod breathed out in the 
the water. If Mother Earth were 
to sigh over the misdeeds of her 
children, it would sound just 
about like that. 

The sahibs jumped up, waving 
and shouting: “Where is he? 

Where is he?” 

I said: “That black spot in the 
water, just to the left and this 
side of that point.” 

They yammered while the 
sauropod filled its lungs and dis- 
appeared. “Is that all?” yelped 
James. “Won’t we see any more 
of him?” 

Holtzinger said: “I read they 
never come out of the water be- 
cause they’re too heavy.” 

“No,” I explained. “They can 
walk perfectly well and often do, 
for egg-laying and moving from 
one swamp to another. But most 
of the time they spend in the 
water, like hippopotamus. They 
eat eight hundred pounds of soft 
swamp plants a day, all with 
those little heads. So they wander 
about the bottoms of lakes and 
swamps, chomping away, and 
stick their heads up to breathe 
every quarter-hour or so. It’s get- 
ting dark, so this fellow will soon 
come out and lie down in the 
shallows to sleep.” 

“Can we shoot one?” demanded 
James. 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



“I wouldn’t,” said I. 

“Why not?” 

I SAID: “There’s no point in it 
and it’s not sporting. First, 
they’re even harder to hit in the 
brain than other dinosaurs be- 
cause of the way they sway their 
heads about on those long necks 
and their hearts are too deeply 
buried in tissue to reach unless 
you’re awfully lucky. Then, if 
you kill one in the water, he sinks 
and can’t be recovered. If you kill 
one on land, the only trophy is 
that little head. You can’t bring 
the whole beast back because he 
weighs thirty tons or more. We 
don’t need thirty tons of meat.” 
Holtzinger said: “That mu- 

seum in New York got one.” 
“Yes,” I agreed. “The American 
Museum of Natural History sent 
a party of forty-eight to the early 
Cretaceous, with a fifty-caliber 
machine gun. They assembled the 
gun on the edge of a swamp, 
killed a sauropod — and spent two 
solid months skinning it and hack- 
ing the carcass apart and drag- 
ging it to the time machine. I 
know the chap in charge of that 
project and he still has night- 
mares in which he smells decom- 
posing dinosaur. They also had 
to kill a dozen big theropods who 
were attracted by the stench and 
refused to be frightened off, so 
they had them lying round and 
rotting, too. And the theropods ate 

21 



three men of the party despite 
the big gun.” 

Next morning, we were finish- 
ing breakfast when one of the 
helpers called: “Look, Mr. Rivers! 
Up there!” 

He pointed along the shoreline. 
There were six big duckbill feed- 
ing in the shallows. They were 
the kind called parasaurolophus, 
with ia .crest consisting of a long 
spike of B^e ' sticking out the 
back of their heads, like the horn 
of an oryx, and a web of skin 
connecting this with the back of 
their neck. 

“Keep your voices down,” I 
said. The duckbill, like the other 
ornithopods, are wary beasts be- 
cause they have no armor or 
weapons against the theropods. 
The duckbill feed on the margins 
of lakes and swamps, and when a 
gorgosaur rushes out of the trees, 
they plunge into deep water and 
swim off. Then when phobo- 
suchus, the super-crocodile, goes 
for them in the water, they flee 
to the land. A hectic sort of life, 
what? 

Holtzinger said: “Uh — Reggie, 
I’ve been thinking over what you 
said about ceratopsian heads. If 
I could get one of those yonder, 
I’d be satisfied. It would look big 
enough in my house, wouldn’t it?” 

“I’m sure of it, old boy,” I said. 
“Now look here. I could take you 
on a detour to come out on the 
shore near there, but we should 

22 



have to plow through half a mile 
of muck and brush, up to our 
knees in water, and they’d hear 
us coming. Or we can creep up to 
the north end of this sand spit, 
from which it’s four or five him- 
dred yards — a long shot, but not 
impMsssible. Think you could do 
it?” 

“With my ’scope sight and a 
sitting position — yes. I’ll try it.” 
“You stay here,” I said to 
James. “This is Augie’s head and 
I don’t want any argument over 
your having fired first.” 

J AMES grunted while Holt- 
zinger clamped his ’scope to 
his rifle. We crouched our way up 
the spit, keeping the sand ridge 
between us and the duckbills. 
When we got to the end where 
there was no more cover, we crept 
along on hands and knees, mov- 
ing slowly. If you move slowly 
directly toward or away from a 
dinosaur, it probably won’t notice 
you. 

The duckbills continued to 
grub about on all fours, every 
few seconds rising to look round. 
Holtzinger eased himself into the 
sitting position, cocked his piece, 
and aimed through the ’scope. 
And then — 

Bang! bang! went a big rifle 
back at the camp. 

Holtzinger jumped. The duck- 
bill jerked up their heads and 
leaped for the deep water, splash- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing like mad. Holtzinger fired 
once and missed. I took a shot at 
the last duckbill before it disap- 
peared. I missed, too: the .600 
isn’t designed for long ranges. 

Holtzinger and I started back 
toward the camp, for it had struck 
us that our party might be in 
theropod trouble and need re- 
inforcements. 

What happened was that a big 
sauropod, probably the one we’d 
heard the night before, had wan- 
dered down past the camp under 
water, feeding as it went. Now 
the water shoaled about a hun- 
dred yards offshore from our spit, 
halfway over to the edge of the 
swamp on the other side. The 
sauropod had ambled up the 
slope until its body was almost 
all out of water, weaving its head 
from side to side and looking for 
anything green to gobble. This 
kind looks like the well-known 
brontosaurus, but a little bigger. 
Scientists argue whether it ought 
to be included in the genus cama- 
rasaurus or a separate genus with 
an even longer name. 

When I came in sight of the 
camp, the sauropod was turning 
round to go back the way it had 
come, making horrid groans. It 
disappeared into deep water, all 
but its head and ten or twenty 
feet of neck, which wove about 
for some time before they van- 
ished into the haze. 

When we came up to the camp, 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



James was arguing with the Raja. 
Holtzinger burst out: “You bas- 
tard! That’s the second time 
you’ve spoiled my shots!” Strong 
language for little August. 

“Don’t be a fool,” said James. 
“I couldn’t let him wander into 
camp and stamp everything flat.” 
“There was no danger of that,” 
objected the Raja politely. “You 
can see thee water is deep off- 
shore. It is just that our trigger- 
happee Mr. James cannot see any 
animal without shooting.” 

¥ SAID: “If it did get close, all 
you needed to do was throw a 
stick of firewood at it. They’re 
perfectly harmless.” This wasn’t 
strictly true. When the Comte de 
Lautrec ran after one for a close 
shot, the sauropod looked back at 
him, gave a flick of its tail, and 
took off the Comte’s head as 
neatly as if he’d been axed in 
the Tower. 

“How was I to know?” yelled 
James, getting purple. “You’re all 
against me. What the hell are we 
on this goddamn trip for except 
to shoot things? You call your- 
selves hunters, but I’m the only 
one who’s hit anything!” 

I got pretty wrothy and said 
he was just an excitable young 
skite with more money than 
brains, whom I should never have 
brought along. 

“If that’s how you feel,” he said, 
“give me a burro and some food 

23 



and I’ll go back to the base by 
myself. I won’t pollute your air 
with my loathsome presence!” 
“Don’t be a bigger ass than you 
can help,” I snapped. “That’s 
quite impossible.” 

‘Then I’ll go all alone!” He 
grabbed his knap>sack, thrust a 
couple of tins of beans and an 
opener into it, and started off with 
his rifle. 

Beauregard Black spoke up: 



“Mr. Rivers, we cain’t let him 
go off like that by hisself. He’ll 
git lost and starve or be et by 
a theropod.” 

“I’ll fetch him back,” said the 
Raja and started after the run- 
away. He caught up as James was 
disappearing into the cycads. We 
could see them arguing and wav- 
ing their hands, but couldn’t make 
out what they said. After a while, 
they started back with arms 




24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



around each other’s necks like old 
school pals. I simply don’t know 
how the Raja does it. 

This shows the trouble we get 
into if we make mistakes in plan- 
ning such a do. Having once got 
back into the past, we had to 
make the best of our bargain. We 
l> always must, you see. 

I don’t want to give the im- 
pression Courtney James was 
, only a pain in the rump. He had 



his good points. He got over these 
rows quickly and next day would 
be as cheerful as ever. He was 
helpful with the general work of 
the camp — when he felt like it, 
at any rate. He sang well and 
had an endless fund of dirty 
stories to keep us amused. 

We stayed two more days at 
that camp. We saw crocodile, the 
small kind, and plenty of sauro- 
pod — as many as five at once — 




A GUN FOR DINOSAUR

but no more duckbill. Nor any of 
those fifty-foot super-crocodiles. 

S O, ON the first of May, we 
broke camp and headed north 
toward the Janpur Hills. My 
sahibs were beginning to harden 
up and were getting impatient. 
We’d been in the Cretaceous a 
week and no trophies. 

I won’t go into details of the 
next leg. Nothing in the way of 
a trophy, save a glimpse of a 
gorgosaur out of range and some 
tracks indicating a whopping big 
iguanodont, twenty-five or thirty 
feet high. We pitched camp at 
the base of the hills. 

We’d finished off the bonehead, 
so the first thing was to shoot 
fresh meat. With an eye to tro- 
phies, too, of course. We got ready 
the morning of the third. 

I told James: “See here, old 
boy, no more of your tricks. The 
Raja will tell you when to shoot.” 
“Uh-huh, I get you,” he said, 
meek as Moses. Never could tell 
how the chap would act. 

We marched off, the four of us, 
into the foothills. We were look- 
ing for bonehead, but we’d take 
an ornithomime. There was also 
a good chance of getting Holt- 
zinger his ceratopsian. We’d seen 
a couple on the way up, but mere 
calves without decent horns. 

It was hot and sticky and we 
were soon panting and sweating 
like horses. We’d hiked and scram- 

26 



bled all morning without seeing 
a thing except lizards, when I 
picked up the smell of carrion. 
I stopped the party and sniffed. 
We were in an open glade cut up 
by these little dry nullahs. The 
nullahs ran together into a couple 
of deeper gorges that cut through 
a slight depression choked with a 
denser growth, cycad and screw- 
pine. When I listened, I heard 
the thrum of carrion flies. 

“This way,” I said. “Something 
ought to be dead — ah, here it is!” 

And there it was: the remains 
of a huge ceratopsian lying in a 
little hollow on the edge of the 
copse. Must have weighed six or 
eight tons alive; a three-horned 
variety, perhaps the penultimate 
species of Triceratops. It was hard 
to tell because most of the hide 
on the upper surface had been 
ripped off and many bones had 
been pulled loose and lay scat- 
tered about. 

IJOLTZINGER said: “Oh, hell! 

Why couldn’t I have gotten 
to him before he died? That 
would have been a darn fine 
head.” Associating with us rough 
types had made little August pro- 
fane, you’ll observe. 

I said: “On your toes, chaps. 
A theropod’s been at this carcass 
and is probably nearby.” 

“How d’you know?” James 
challenged, with the sweat run- 
ning off his round red face. He 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



spoke in what was for him a low 
voice, because a nearby theropod 
is a sobering thought even to the 
flightiest. 

I sniffed again and thought I 
could detect the distinctive rank 
odor of theropod. But I couldn’t 
be sure because the stench of the 
carcass was so strong. My sahibs 
were turning green at the sight 
and smell of the cadaver. 

I told James: “It’s seldom even 
the biggest theropod will attack 
a full-grown ceratopsian. Those 
horns are too much for them. But 
they love a dead or dying one. 
They’ll hang round a dead cera- 
topsian for weeks, gorging and 
then sleeping their meals off for 
days at a time. They usually take 
cover in the heat of the day any- 
how, because they can’t stand 
much direct hot sunlight. You’ll 
find them lying in copses like this 
or in hollows, anywhere there’s 
shade.’’ 

“What’ll we do?” asked Holt- 
zinger. 

“We’ll make our first cast 
through this copse, in two pairs 
as usual. Whatever you do, don’t 
get impulsive or panicky.” I 
looked at Courtney James, but 
he looked right back and then 
merely checked his gun. 

“Should I still carry this 
broken?” he wanted to know. 

“No; close it, but keep the 
safety on till you’re ready to 
shoot,” I said. It’s risky carrying 

A 6UN FOR DINOSAUR 



a double closed like that, espe- 
cially in brush, but with a thero- 
pod nearby, it would have been a 
greater risk to carry it open and 
perhaps catch a twig in it when 
one tried to close it. 

“We’ll keep closer than usual, 
to be in sight of each other,” I 
said. “Start off at that angle. Raja. 
Go slowly and stop to listen be- 
tween steps.” 

We pushed through the edge 
of the copse, leaving the carcass 
but not its stink behind us. For a 
few feet, we couldn’t see a thing. 
It opened out as we got in under 
the trees, which shaded out some 
of the brush. The Sun slanted 
down through the trees. I could 
hear nothing but the hum of in- 
sects and the scuttle of lizards 
and the squawks of toothed birds 
in a treetop. I thought I could 
be sure of the theropod smell, but 
told myself that might be imagi- 
nation. The theropod might be 
any of several species, large or 
small, and the beast itself might 
be anywhere within a half-mile 
radius. 

“Go on,” I whispered to Holt- 
zinger, for I could hear James 
and the Raja pushing ahead on 
my right and see the palm-fronds 
and ferns lashing about as they 
disturbed them. I suppose they 
were trying to move quietly, but 
to me they sounded like an earth- 
quake in a crockery shop. 

“A little closer,” I called, and 

27 



presently they appeared slanting 
in toward me. 

DROPPED into a gully 
” filled with ferns and clam- 
bered up the other side, then 
found our way blocked by a big 
clump of palmetto. 

“You go round that side: we’ll 
go round this,” I said, and we 
started off, stopping to listen and 
smell. Our positions were exactly 
the same as on that first day 
when James killed the bonehead. 

I judge we’d gone two-thirds 
of the way round our half of the 
palmetto when I heard a noise 
ahead on our left. Holtzinger 
heard it and pushed off his safety. 
I put my thumb on mine and 
stepped to one side to have a 
clear field. 

The clatter grew louder. I 
raised my gun to aim at about 
the height a big theropod’s heart 
would be at the distance it would 
appear to us out of the greenery. 
There was a movement in the 
foliage — and a six-foot-high bone- 
head stepped into view, walking 
solemnly across our front from 
left to right, jerking its head with 
each step like a giant pigeon. 

I heard Holtzinger let out a 
breath and had to keep myself 
from laughing. Holtzinger said: 
“Uh— ” 

“Quiet,” I whispered. “The 
theropod might still — ” 

That was as far as I got when 



that damned gun of James’s went 
off, ban^! bang! I had a glimpse 
of the bonehead knocked arsy- 
varsy with its tail and hindlegs 
flying. 

“Got him!” yelled James, and 
I heard him run forward. 

“My God, if he hasn’t done it 
again!” I groaned. Then there was 
a great swishing, not made by the 
dying bonehead, and a wild yell 
from James. Something heaved 
up and out of the shrubbery and 
I saw the head of the biggest of 
the local flesh-eaters, tyranno- 
saurus trionyches himself. 

The scientists can insist that 
rex is bigger than trionchyes, but 
I’ll swear this tyrannosaur was 
bigger than any rex ever hatched. 
It must have stood twenty feet 
high and been fifty feet long. I 
could see its big bright eye and 
six-inch teeth and the big dewlap 
that hangs down from its chin to 
its chest. 

The second of the nullahs that 
cut through the copse ran athwart 
our path on the far side of the 
palmetto clump. Perhaps six feet 
deep. The tyrannosaur had been 
lying in this, sleeping off its last 
meal. Where its back stuck up 
above ground level, the ferns on 
the edge of the nullah masked it. 
James had fired both barrels over 
the theropod’s head and woke it 
up. Then James, to compound his 
folly, ran forward without reload- 
ing. Another twenty feet and he’d 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have stepped on the tyranno- 
saur’s back. 

J AMES understandably stopped 
when this thing popped up in 
front of him. He remembered his 
gun was empty and he’d left the 
Raja too far behind to get a clear 
shot. 

James kept his nerve at first. 
He broke open his gun, took two 
rounds from his belt and plugged 
them into the barrels. But in his 
haste to snap the gun shut, he 
caught his right hand between 
the barrels and the action — the 
fleshy part between his thumb 
and palm. It was a painful pinch 
and so startled James that he 
dropped his gun. That made him 
go to pieces and he bolted. 

His timing couldn’t have been 
worse. The Raja was running up 
with his gun at high port, ready 
to snap it to his shoulder the 
instant he got a clear view of the 
tyrannosaur. When he saw James 
running headlong toward him, it 
made him hesitate, as he didn’t 
want to shoot James. The latter 
plunged ahead and, before the 
Raja could jump aside, blundered 
into him and sent them both 
sprawling among the ferns. The 
tyrannosaur collected what little 
wits it had and crashed after to 
snap them up. 

And how about Holtzinger and 
me on the other side of the pal- 
mettos? Well, the instant James 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



yelled and the tyrannosaur’s head 
appeared, Holtzinger darted for- 
ward like a rabbit. I’d brought 
my gun up for a shot at the tyran- 
nosaur’s head, in hope of getting 
at least an eye, but before I could 
find it in my sights, the head was 
out of sight behind the palmettos. 
Perhaps I should have shot at 
where I thought it was, but all 
my experience is against wild 
shots. 

When I looked back in front 
of me, Holtzinger had already 
disappeared round the curve of 
the palmetto clump. I’m pretty 
heavily built, as you can see, but 
I started after him with a good 
turn of speed, when I heard his 
rifle and the click of the bolt 
between shots: bang — click-click 
— bang — click-click, like that. 

He’d come up on the tyranno- 
saur’s quarter as the brute started 
to stoop for James and the Raja. 
With his muzzle twenty feet from 
the tyrannosaur’s hide, he began 
pumping .375s into the beast’s 
body. He got off three shots when 
the tyrannosaur gave a tremen- 
dous booming grunt and wheeled 
round to see what was stinging it. 
The jaws came open and the head 
swung round and down again. 

Holtzinger got off one more 
shot and tried to leap to one 
side. He was standing on a nar- 
row place between the palmetto 
clump and the nullah. So he fell 
into the nullah. The tyrannosaur 

29 



continued its lunge and caught 
him, either as he was falling or 
after he struck bottom. The jaws 
went chomp and up came the 
head with poor Holtzinger in 
'^■^hem, screaming like a doomed 
soul. 

1 CAME up just then and 
aimed at the brute’s face. 
Then I realized its jaws were full 
of my friend and I’d be shooting 
him. As the head went up, like 
the business end of a big power 
shovel, I fired a shot at the heart. 
But the tyrannosaur was already 
turning away and I suspect the 
ball just glanced along the ribs. 

The beast took a couple of 
steps away when I gave it the 
other barrel in the back. It stag- 
gered on its next step but kept 
on. Another step and it was nearly 
out of sight among the trees, 
when the Raja fired twice. The 
stout fellow had untangled him- 
self from James, got up, picked 
up his gun and let the tyranno- 
saur have it. 

The double wallop knocked the 
brute over with a tremendous 
smash. It fell into a dwarf mag- 
nolia and I saw one of its hind- 
legs waving in the midst of a 
V shower of incongruously pretty 
pink-and-white jDetals. 

Can you imagine the leg of a 
bird of prey enlarged and thick- 
ened until it’s as big round as 
the leg of an elephant? 

30 



But the tyrannosaur got up 
again and blundered off without 
even dropping its victim. The last 
I saw of it was Holtzinger’s legs 
dangling out one side of its jaws 
(by now he’d stopped screaming) 
and its big tail banging against 
the tree-trunks as it swung from 
side to side. 

The Raja and I reloaded and 
ran after the brute for all we 
were worth. I tripped and fell 
once, but jumped up again and 
didn’t notice my skinned elbow 
till later. When we burst out of 
the copse, the tyrannosaur was 
already at the far end of the 
glade. I took a quick shot, but 
probably missed, and it was out 
of sight before I could fire an- 
other. 

We ran on, following the tracks 
and spatters of blood, until we 
had to stop from exhaustion. 
Their movements look slow and 
ponderous, but with those tre- 
mendous legs, they don’t have to 
step very fast to work up con- 
siderable speed. 

When we’d finished gasping 
and mopping our foreheads, we 
tried to track the tyrannosaur, on 
the theory that it might be dying 
and we should come up to it. But 
the spoor faded out and left us at 
a loss. We circled round hoping 
to pick it up, but no luck. 

Hour later, we gave up and 
went back to the glade, feeling 
very dismal.

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



31 








C OURTNEY JAMES was sit- 
ting with his back against a 
tree, holding his rifle and Holt- 
zinger’s. His right hand was swol- 
len and blue where he’d pinched 
it, but still usable. 

His first words were: “Where 
the hell have you been? You 
shouldn’t have gone off and left 
me; another of those things might 
have come along. Isn’t it bad 
enough to lose one hunter through 
your stupidity without risking an- 
other one?” 

I’d been preparing a pretty 
warm wigging for James, but his 
attack so astonished me, I could 
only bleat: “We lost — ?” 

“Sure,” he said. “You put us in 
front of you, so if anybody gets 
eaten, it’s us. You send a guy 
up against these animals under- 
gunned. You — ” 

“You stinking little swine,” I 
began and went on from there. 
I learned later he’d spent his 
his time working out an elaborate 
theory according to which this 
disaster was all our fault — Holt- 
zinger’s, the Raja’s and mine. 
Nothing about James’s firing out 
of turn or panicking or Holt- 
zinger’s saving his worthless life. 
Oh, dear, no. It was the Raja’s 
fault for not jumping out of his 
way, etcetera. 

Well, I’ve led a rough life and 
can express myself quite elo- 
quently. The Raja tried to keep 
up with me, but ran out of Eng- 



lish and was reduced to cursing 
James in Hindustani. 

I could see by the purple color 
on James’s face that I was get- 
ting home. If I’d stopped to think, 
I should have known better than 
to revile a man with a gun. Pres- 
ently James put down Holt- 
zinger’s rifle and raised his own, 
saying: “Nobody calls me things 
like that and gets away with it. 
I’ll just say the tyrannosaur ate 
you, too.” 

The Raja and I were standing 
with our guns broken open, under 
our arms, so it would take a good 
part of a second to snap them 
shut and bring them up to fire. 
Moreover, you don’t shoot a .600 
holding it loosely in your hands, 
not if you know what’s good for 
you. Next thing, James was set- 
ting the butt of his .500 against 
his shoulder, with the barrels 
pointed at my face. Looked like 
a pair of blooming vehicular 
tunnels. 

The Raja saw what was hap- 
pening before I did. As the beg- 
gar brought his gun up, he stepped 
forward with a tremendous kick. 
Used to play football as a young 
chap, you see. He knocked the 
.500 up and it went off so the 
bullet missed my head by an inch 
and the explosion jolly well near 
broke my eardrums. 

The butt had been punted 
away from James’s shoulder when 
the gun went off, so it came back 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like the kick of a horse. It spun 
him half round. 

The Raja dropped his own gun, 
grabbed the barrels and twisted it 
out of James’s hands, nearly 
breaking the bloke’s trigger finger. 
He meant to hit James with the 
butt, but I rapped James across 
the head with my own barrels, 
then bowled him over and began 
punching the stuffing out of him. 
He was a good-sized lad, but 
with my sixteen stone, he had no 
chance. 

TWTHEN HIS face was properly 
” discolored, I stopped. We 
turned him over, took a strap out 
of his knapsack and tied his wrists 
behind him. We agreed there was 
no safety for us unless we kept 
him under guard every minute 
until we got him back to our 
time. Once a man has tried to 
kill you, don’t give him another 
opportunity. Of course he might 
never try again, but why risk it? 

We marched James back to 
camp and told the crew what we 
were up against. James cursed 
everybody and dared us to kill 
him. 

“You’d better, you sons of 
bitches, or I’ll kill you some day,” 
he said. “Why don’t you? Because 
you know somebody’d give you 
away, don’t you? Ha-ha!” 

The rest of that safari was 
dismal. We spent three days 
combing the country for that 

A GUN FOR DINOSAUR 



t3n-annosaur. No luck. It might 
have been lying in any of those 
nullahs, dead or convalescing, 
and we should never see it un- 
less we blundered on top of it. But 
we felt it wouldn’t have been 
cricket not to make a good try 
at recovering Holtzinger’s re- 
mains, if any. 

After we got back to our main 
camp, it rained. When it wasn’t 
raining, we collected small rep- 
tiles and things for our scien- 
tific friends. When the transition 
chamber materialized, we fell 
over one another getting into it. 

The Raja and I had discussed 
the question of legal proceedings 
by or against Courtney James. 
We decided there was no prece- 
dent for punishing crimes com- 
mitted eighty-five million years 
before, which would presumably 
be outlawed by the statute of 
limitations. We therefore untied 
him and pushed him into the 
chamber after all the others but 
us had gone through. 

When we came out in the pres- 
ent, we handed him his gun — 
empty — and his other effects. As 
we expected, he walked off with- 
out a word, his arms full of gear. 
At that point, Holtzinger’s girl, 
Claire Roche, rushed up crying: 
“Where is he? Where’s August?” 

I WON’T go over the painful 
scene except to say it was dis- 
tressing in spite of the Raja’s 

33 



skill at that sort of thing. 

We took our men and beasts 
down to the old laboratory build- 
ing that Washington University 
has fitted up as a serai for ex- 
peditions to the past. We paid 
everybody off and found we were 
nearly broke. The advance pay- 
ments from Holtzinger and James 
didn’t cover our expenses and we 
should have damned little chance 
of collecting the rest of our fees 
from James or from Holtzinger’s 
estate. 

And speaking of James, d’you 
know what that blighter was do- 
ing all this time? He went home, 
got more ammunition and came 
back to the university. He hunted 
up Professor Prochaska and asked 
him: 

“Professor, I’d like you to send 
me back to the Cretaceous for a 
quick trip. If you can work me 
into your schedule right now, you 
can just about name your own 
price. I’ll offer five thousand to 
begin with. I want to go to April 
twenty-third, eighty-five million 
B.C.” 

Prochaska answered: “Vot do 
you vant to go back again so soon 
so badly for?” 

“I lost my wallet in the Creta- 
ceous,” said James. “I figure if I 
go back to the day before I ar- 
rived in that era on my last trip. 
I’ll watch myself when I arrived 
on that trip and follow myself 
till I see myself lose the wallet.” 

34 



“Five thousand is a lot for a 
vallet.” 

“It’s got some things in it I 
can’t replace. Suppose you let me 
worry about whether it’s worth 
my while.” 

“Veil,” said Prochaska, think- 
ing, “the party that vas supposed 
to go out this morning has phoned 
that they vould be late, so maybe 
I can vork you in. I have alvays 
vondered vot vould happen vhen 
the same man occupied the same 
time tvice.” 

So James wrote out a check 
and Prochaska took him to the 
chamber and saw him off. James’s 
idea, it seems, was to sit behind 
a bush a few yards from where 
the transition chamber would ap- 
pear and pot the Raja and me as 
we emerged. 

TT OURS later, we’d changed 
into our street-clothes and 
phoned our wives to come get us. 
We were standing on Forsythe 
Boulevard waiting for them when 
there was a loud crack, like an 
explosion or a close-by clap of 
thunder, and a flash of light not 
fifty feet from us. The shock- 
wave staggered us and broke 
windows in quite a number of 
buildings. 

We ran toward the place and 
got there just as a policeman and 
several citizens came up. On the 
boulevard, just off the curb, lay 
a human body. At least it had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been that, but it looked as if 
every bone in it had been pul- 
verized and every blood vessel 
burst. The clothes it had been 
wearing were shredded, but I 
recognized an H. & H. .500 
double-barreled express rifle. The 
wood was scorched and the 
metal pitted, but it was Courtney 
James’s gun. No doubt whatever. 

Skipping the investigations and 
the milling about, what had hap- 
pened was this : Nobody had shot 
us as we emerged on the twenty- 
fourth and that, of course, couldn’t 
be changed. For that matter, the 
instant James started to do any- 
thing that would make a visible 
change in the world of eighty- 
five million B.C., the space-time 
forces would snap him forward 
to the present to prevent a para- 
dox. 

Now that this is better under- 
stood, the professor won’t send 
anybody to a jDeriod less than 
five hundred years prior to the 
time that some time traveler has 
already explored, because it 
would be too easy to do some 
act, like chopping down a tree or 
losing some durable artifact, that 
would affect the later world. Over 
long periods, he tells me, such 
changes average out and are lost 
in the stream of time. 

We had a bloody rough time 
after that, with the bad publicity 
and all, though we did collect a 
fee from James’s estate. The dis- 



aster hadn’t been entirely James’s 
fault. I shouldn’t have taken him 
when I knew what a spoiled, un- 
stable sort he was. And if Holt- 
zinger could have used a heavy 
gun, he’d probably have knocked 
the tyrannosaur down, even if he 
didn’t kill it, and so given the rest 
of us a chance to finish it. 

So that’s why I won’t take you 
to that p>eriod to hunt. There are 
plenty of other eras, and if you 
think them ovpr, I’m sure you’ll 
find — 

Good Lord, look at the time! 
Must run, old boy; my wife’ll 
skin me. Good night!

1 AM PROUD and happy to 
announce that contact with 
intelligent beings other than 
ourselves has Anally been 
achieved and that, as a result of 
that meeting, peace has come at 
last, with the peoples of all na- 
tions firmly united behind a shin- 
ing new doctrine. 

The true story of this final 
contact has been delayed for 

36 



several months, for security rea- 
sons, which necessitated that any 
publication of the facts be 
cleared first with the Secret Ser- 
vice, the FBI, the Treasury De- 
partment, the ICC, the Immigra- 
tion Service and Senator Bang — 
who, while he had no direct offi- 
cial connection with the matter, 
would have caused everybody 
else a lot of trouble if he hadn’t 

GALAXY SCIiNCE FICTION 



been checked with first. 

Also, it was necessary to clear 
with the opposite numbers of the 
above individuals and organiza- 
tions in some one hundred and 
twenty-seven other nations, who 
either had representatives at the 
final contact aforementioned, or 
learned about it afterward in one 
way or another, and were under- 
standably miffed at not being in- 
vited to the conference, as they 
called it. 

The story actually begins some 
few months back when a space- 
ship landed on the lawn of the 
White House one morning about 
eight A. M. and the President, 
looking out the window of his 
bedroom, perceived it. 

“A spaceship!” he ejaculated. 

“That is correct, sir,” replied a 
voice inside his head. “The ship 
you see is the racing spaceabout 
Sunbeam and I am Captain Bligh. 
Over.” 

“Captain Bligh!” echoed the 
astounded President. 

“Why, yes — ” The voice broke 
off suddenly and the President re- 
ceived the impression of a 
chuckle of amusement. “Oh, I see 
the coincidence that startles you. 
I read you loud and clear. Strange, 
isn’t it, how words will sometimes 
duplicate themselves in a totally 
alien language? If you will go 
down to your office, you will meet 
me and we can talk there. Over.” 

“I’ll be right down,” said the 



President, hurriedly grabbing for 
his pants. 

“Right. See you then. Over and 
out.” 

“Over and out,” replied the 
President mechanically. 

tTE RUSHED down to his of- 
fice and locked the door. A 
curtain by the window stirred and 
there stepped into view a crea- 
ture slightly shorter than himself, 
but much heavier, equipped with 
tentacles and fangs. The Presi- 
dent, however, was pleasantly 
surprised to note that it — or ra- 
ther he, for it later turned out 
that Captain Bligh was, indeed, 
a male — did not in the least re- 
pel him with his alienness, this 
being the first human to discover 
that no totally unfamiliar form 
can arouse an emotional response. 

“Captain Bligh, I presume,” he 
said politely. 

“The same,” replied the cap- 
tain in passable English. “I have 
been profiting by the interval 
since we last spoke to learn your 
language and succeeded to some 
degree. Two-way mental radio is 
a marvelous device, you know. 
Over.” 

“Roger — I mean you do very 
nicely,” said the President, pass- 
ing a hand over his damp brow. 
“But you know, my dear sir, that 
ship of yours will attract all sorts 
of attention.” 

“Not at all,” answered Bligh. 



FIAT TIGER

“The spaceabout’s light-reflecting 
properties have been heterodyned 
to yohr personal retinal pattern 
only. Be assured that you are the 
only man on this world that can 
see it at the present moment.” 
“That’s a relief. You have no 
idea how the papers would jump 
on something like this.” He ges- 
tured to a chair. “Won’t you sit 
down?” 

“Thanks, but I’d rather stand. 
No leg joints, you see. You’re 
probably wondering how I hap- 
pen to be here.” 

“Well, I don’t think I should 
commit myself by giving you a 
definite answer immediately on 
that,” said the President cautious- 
ly- 

“No matter,” said Bligh. “I will 
explain anyway. I happen to be 
in a round -the-Galaxy race at 
the moment — the Sunbeam is a 
stripped-down hot-warp. Unfor- 
tunately, as I was passing your 
solar system, I got a flat tiger 
and had to pull in for repairs.” 
“I beg your pardon?” queried 
the President. “Did you say a 
flat tiger?” 

“Excuse me,” said Bligh. “I 
should have explained. The tiger 
— Felts Tigris Longipilis or what 
you know as the Siberian tiger — 
is a discarded mutant variform 
of a race which was formerly dis- 
tributed ever3Twhere throughout 
the Galaxy, but which has since 
ended its physical existence and 



passed on — ” Captain Bligh’s 
voice took on a reverent hush and 
he removed the top of his head, 
considerably startling the Presi- 
dent until he realized that it was 
actually a cap of some sort — 
“to that great macro-universe up 
yonder to which we must all go 
one day.” 

T he President cleared his 
throat embarrassedly. Cap- 
tain Bligh put his cap back on 
and continued his explanation. 

“Tigers are, therefore, to be 
found on every world and familiar 
to every intelligent race. Since 
they still possess many of the 
potentials of their departed mas- 
ter-strain, they have been bred 
and conditioned to a variety of 
uses. One of the most widespread 
of these is as neural governors 
on the feeders that meter out 
fuel to the warp engines. The 
fuel feed must be controlled with 
such delicacy that no mechani- 
cal process can be devised fine 
enough. I have four warp engines 
on my Sunbeam and therefore, 
naturally, four tigers; one petty 
tiger and three tigers second 
class.” 

“Ah — yes,” the President re- 
plied. “But you said that this 
tiger was flat.” 

“Exactly. My tigers and others 
like them have been bred and 
trained for their work. It is a 
very exacting job, as you can 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



38 



imagine, since a tiger’s attention 
must not waver for one milli- 
second while the ship is in opera- 
tion. To aid them in their 
concentration, the tigers’ lungs 
are filled with a drug in gaseous 
form under high pressure, which, 
being slowly absorbed into the 
bloodstream, keeps them in a 
state of hyper-concentration.” 

“Oh?” said the President. “But 
why a gaseous drug? I should 
think an injection — ” 

“Not at all. A gaseous drug has 
the great advantage that when 
the trip is over, or at any moment 
when the situation may require 
it, the tiger may exhale and with- 
in a few seconds be rid of the 
effects of the drug. No tiger of 
your planet, of course, could do 
it — but our tigers are quite cap- 
able of holding their breaths for 
weeks.” 

“Then how did this accident 
occur?” 

“My Number One Port Tiger 
somehow omitted a basal metab- 
olism test at his last physical 
checkup,” said the Captain sadly. 
“I am sorry to say that he was 
eighteen points over normal and 
used up his gas ahead of schedule. 
There is no room on the ship to 
set up the gas-manufacturing ap- 
paratus and, of course, yours was 
the only habitable planet for us 
to land on in this system. I did 
not know it was — er — civi- 
lized.” 



“And when you saw it was?” 
prompted the President. 

“I looked you up immedi- 
ately,” replied the Captain. “I am 
in no sense an official, but I 
could hardly wait to offer you the 
tentacle of friendship on behalf of 
the Galactic Confraternity of In- 
telligences.” 

C OUGHING explosively to 
gain a little time, the Presi- 
dent dabbed at his mouth with 
his handkerchief and put it away 
again. 

“I am only, you must under- 
stand,. executive head of this one 
nation.” 

“Oh? I see — ” said Captain 
Bligh, telepathing the equivalent 
of a bothered frown. “That makes 
it troublesome. Time is, of course, 
relative; but there’s this little 
matter of my possibly losing the 
race if I have to spend too much 
time here. I can, of course, notify 
Exploration when I reach the 
finish point on Capra IV, but that 
will mean centuries of red tape. 
It would short-cut things enor- 
mously if I could carry word di- 
rectly to Confraternity Head- 
quarters that you already consider 
yourselves a member world.” 
“Oh, I see,” said the President. 
“Tell me, just how much time can 
you afford to spend?” 

“Well, let me see — To set up 
the apparatus, one of your days — 
To gas Number One Port Tiger,

two days — To dismantle, half a 
day. Say, three days from this 
coming sunset.” 

“Hum,” said the President 
thoughtfully, “I’ll see what I can 
do.” 

They went outside to the space- 
about together. 

“Be with you in a minute,” 
said the Captain and dived in 
through the airlock of his vessel, 
to return a moment later, carry- 
ing — he was obviously of inhu- 
man strength — a rather thin, 
helpless-looking tiger. 

“Mr. President,” said the Cap- 
tain. “May I present my Number 
One Port Tiger, second class.” 

The Tiger extended a paw. 

“This is indeed an honor,” it 
telepathed feebly. 

“Not at all, not at all,” said 
the President gingerly shaking 
the animal’s paw. 

“The poor fella’s worn out,” 
said the Captain in an aside to 
the President as he laid the Num- 
ber One Port Tiger on the White 
House lawn. “The last of his gas 
went while we were still a num- 
ber of light-years short of your 
system and we went the last 
stretch on nerve alone. Pretty 
well took it out of him.” 

Looking at Number One Port 
lie on the grass, looking more 
like a cardboard cut-out of a 
tiger than the real item, the 
President was inclined to agree. 

“You’re going to set up your 



apparatus here?” he asked, some- 
what nervously. 

Bligh instantly comprehended 
the cause of his agitation. “Don’t 
worry,” he reassured. “I guaran- 
tee complete invisibility.” 

“Well, if you think so — ” re- 
plied the President, rather doubt- 
fully. “I’ll leave you to that and 
see what I can do in this other 
matter.” 

T he President returned to his 
office and sat down at his 
desk, pressing a button as he did 
so. A few seconds later, his Spe- 
cial Secretary, Morion Stanchly, 
put in an appearance. 

“Yes, Mr. President?” he said. 
“Sit down. Morion,” said the 
President. “I have something to 
discuss with you.” And he waved 
his Special Secretary to a chair. 

Morion Stanchly was a little 
administrative secret. He had 
been around the White House for 
forty years, inheriting the office 
from his father who had had it 
in turn from his father, and so on 
back to Preserved Stanchly, who 
had first been named to the post 
by General Washington, before 
the General became President. It 
was, of course, an unofficial post. 
Special Secretaries were always 
carried on the payroll under a 
different title and usually under 
a different name. Morion was, at 
the moment, down on the official 
books as a White House chauf- 



FIAT TIGER 



41 



feur named Joe Smith. 

He would remain Joe Smith 
until some contingency required 
him to adopt another cover name 
and occupation. But he would 
not leave the White House; and 
the secret of his existence would 
be passed on by word of mouth 
as a strictly administrative secret 
from one President to the next. 
His duty was to do the impos- 
sible. 

He was a tall, dark-browed 
capable-looking man in his early 
sixties and he nodded agreeably 
as he took his chair. 

“Morion,” said the President. 
“We have been contacted from 
outer space.” 

A true Stanchly, Morion mere- 
ly raised one eyebrow quizzically. 
“Yes, sir?” he said. “And — ” 

The President told him the 
whole story. Morion got up and 
looked out the window onto the 
White House lawn. But, of course, 
he saw nothing. 

“What would you like me to 
do, sir?” he said, returning to his 
seat. 

“Three days,” said the Presi- 
dent. “I know it sounds ridicu- 
lous — but would there be any 
possible chance of arranging a 
meeting of the Four of us inside 
of three days?” Hardly were the 
words out of his mouth when he 
realized how incongruous they 
sounded. “No, no, of course not,” 
he said. “I’m thrown a little off 

42 



balance by this thing. Morion. 
Maybe — ” 

“Well, now, Mr. President,” 
said Morion judiciously. “All 
Four. Well, now — ” 

The President looked at him 
with hope beginning to revive in 
his eyes. 

“Morion!” he said. “You don’t 
mean — ” 

“There is a certain possibility,” 
said the Special Secretary. “Con- 
sidering the gravity and urgency 
of the situation. Mark you — just 
a possibility. I’ll have to swear 
you to secrecy, of course.” 

“Anything, Morion, anything!” 
“Very well, then,” said the 
Special Secretary. 

H e rose from his chair and 
went to one wall of the room. 
He pushed aside a picture of a 
former President that was hang- 
ing there and revealed the front 
of a wall safe. His fingers spun 
the dial, the safe opened and he 
removed an old-fashioned wall- 
phone with a handcrank, from 
which a long cord led back into 
the depths of the safe. He car- 
ried the phone to the desk and 
set it down. 

“Would you lock the door, Mr. 
President?” he asked courteously. 

The President went to do so, 
hearing behind his back the shir- 
ring ring of the phone as Morion 
turned the bell crank for one long 
ring and three shorts. There was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a slight pause; and then the Spe- 
cial Secretary spoke into the an- 
tiquated mouthpiece. 

“Hello? Boris? This is Morion 
. why, yes. A trifle chilly here. 
Yes, a head cold. No! You don’t 
say. No! Is that a fact? Not really. 
No — ” He paused, covered the 
mouthpiece with his hand and 
turned apologetically to the Presi- 
dent. 

“If you don’t mind, Mr. Presi- 
dent,” he said. “Perhaps you’d 
better wait outside, after all.” 

Bowing his head, the President 
unlocked the office door and went 
out, closing it behind him. Out- 
side, he lit a cigarette and paced 
up and down nervously. 

After a short while, he returned 
to the office door and opened it 
a crack. The voice of Morion 
came to his ear, in conversation 
now with a man apparently 
named Cecil. The President went 
back to his pacing for another 
fifteen minutes and then ven- 
tured to open the door again. 
Morion waved him to come back 
inside. 

“ — that’s right, Raoul,” he 
was saying into the mouthpiece. 
“Here tomorrow at three o’clock 
local time, in the afternoon. Yes 
. Yes. You may bring your 
man in by the north underground 
entrance. Yes . Yes, indeed. 
The same to you and Felice. 
Good-by.” 

He hung up, returned the 



phone to the safe, closed the safe 
and replaced the picture. 

“They’ll be here tomorrow, sir,” 
he told the President. 

“Morion!” said the President, 
delightedly. “This is miraculous.” 

“Part of my duties, sir,” replied 
Morion, immovably. 

“It is a miracle!” said the Presi- 
dent. “What would I do without 
you? Tell me. Morion — those 
other men you were talking to. 
They wouldn’t by any chance 
be the Special Secretaries o( — ” 

“Mr. President!” interrupted 
Morion, deeply shocked. 

“Oh, sorry,” said the President. 
“I didn’t mean to pry.” 

“Such information is absolute- 
ly restricted.” 

“Sorry.” 

“Well, now,” said Morion, the 
stern lines of his face relaxing. 
“No damage was done, fortunate- 
ly. You understand, though, that 
the strictest security is necessary 
in my work.” 

“Oh, of course,” said the Presi- 
dent. “Where shall I meet the 
other — the visitors. Morion?” 

“I would suggest right here in 
your office, Mr. President,” said 
Morion. “Leave the details to 
me.” 

“Gladly,” said the President. 
“And now,” he added a trifle ner- 
vously, “perhaps I’d better go 
back outside and let Captain 
Bligh know.” 

“I would advise that, sir,” said 



FLAT TIGER 



43 



Morion Stanchly, nodding soberly. 

“I will be honored to attend 
your meeting,” said Captain 
Bligh, waving a cheerful tentacle 
as he busily connected pieces of 
equipment together. 

A t three o’clock the fol- 
lowing day, Captain Bligh 
and the President were ensconced 
in the President’s office, for the 
meeting that would start as soon 
as those others due to be present 
had arrived. They were talking 
golf. Or rather the President was 
talking golf, and the Captain, as 
befitted a being strongly sports- 
conscious, was listening. 

“ The fourteenth on that par- 
ticular course is a dog-leg,” the 
President was saying. “Three hun- 
dred and forty-five yards from 
tee to pin. I decided to take a 
chance — ” 

There was a discreet knock on 
the door and Morion appeared, 
ushering in, in that order, the 
Prime Minister of England, the 
President of France and the Sec- 
retary of a Certain Party in 
Russia. 

The President of the United 
States rose to his feet. 

“Gentlemen,” he said warmly. 
“May I present Captain Bligh of 
the Galactic Confraternity of In- 
telligences — ” and there was the 
usual bustle of hand and tentacle 
shaking and personal introduc- 
tions, which ended with all four 

44 



of the humans seated around the 
President’s desk and Bligh stand- 
ing facing them all. 

“To start the ball rolling,” said 
our President, “may I say that . 
there is nothing official about this 
meeting. Just a little — er — get- 
together.” 

“Of course,” said Great Britain. 

“But certainly,” said France. 

“Maybe,” said the Secretary of 
the Certain Party, looking suspi- 
ciously at Bligh. 

“Well, at any rate,” said the 
President, hurrying along, “since 
the meeting’s to be informal, I 
suggest we get right down to busi- 
ness. I assume that you have all 
been informed of the reasons for 
Captain Bligh’s presence on 
Earth and his willingness to carry 
to the Confraternity Earth’s wish 
to join the rest of the Galaxy in 
that great organization to which 
he belongs. The question in my 
mind, and I’m sure in yours, is 
why it would or would not be 
feasible for us to do so. Captain 
Bligh has offered to cast some 
light on this question for us by 
explaining something of what life 
is like as a member of the Con- 
fraternity and afterward answer- 
ing any questions we may wish 
to put him. Captain Bligh?” 

H e sat down. Leaving the 
floor to the Captain, who 
waved a tentacle modestly. 

“Well, now,” he said. “I’ll see 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



what I can do to satisfy you peo- 
ple about the Galaxy. As you 
know, there’s nothing official 
about my visit or myself and 
there are many octillions of be- 
ings who could describe the situ- 
ation much better than I — you’ll 
meet some of them if you decide 
to join the Confraternity. But I’ll 
do my best as an amateur and a 
sports-being to pinch hit for 
them. 

“I don’t happen to know the 
figures on how many races and 
inhabited worlds there are in the 
Confraternity. Let’s just say that 
there are enough of both to make 
their exact counting a thing of 
merely academic interest. As for 
why you haven’t been visited be- 
fore — a question my host here 
asked me on the first day of my 
arrival — you know how it is. 
Most of the Galaxy has been ex- 
plored; and, without any offense, 
you are in kind of an out-of-the- 
way corner here. I’d say it was 
inevitable that someone should 
come along sooner or later and 
find you; but not so surprising 
that it hasn’t happened before 
this, though for all I know, you 
may have been noted down in 
some ship’s logbook a few thou- 
sand years ago — ” 

“Look here,” interrupted the 
Prime Minister, “if something like 
that happened, wouldn’t the Con- 
fraternity have taken some meas- 
ures to acquaint us with their 

FIAT TIGER 



existence? Now wouldn’t they?” 

“Well — I suppose they might 
have,” said Bligh, a trifle em- 
barrassed. “But a few thousand 
years ago, I don’t imagine you 
would have been too much in- 
terested in interstellar travel. 
Plenty to keep you occupied here, 
then, you know. Not too much 
point in making a big to-do about 
establishing contact. Of course, I 
don’t know if that’s what might 
have happened, it’s only a reason- 
able guess.” 

“Grumpf!” said the Prime 
Minister. 

“How about these flying sau- 
cers?” demanded the President of 
France. 

“Pardon me?” asked Bligh. 

The President of France ex- 
plained. 

“Oh,” said Bligh. “Chlorophyll- 
sniffers. Perfectly harmless, but 
a slight menace to low-flying air- 
craft. Every planet has them 
flitting in occasionally. A few 
billion tons of soap bubbles re- 
leased in your upper atmosphere 
will scare them off.” 

T he president of France 

looked uncertain, but made 
a note of Bligh’s answer. 

“You’re supposed to be tele- 
pathic,” said the Prime Minister, 
returning to the attack. “Aren’t 
there some telepaths in this Con- 
fraternity that would have re- 
ceived our — er — thought what- 

45 



chamacallits? Wouldn’t there?” 

“Well, yes,” said Bligh. “Bound 
to be, I suppose. There’s some 
races that can hear an electron 
scratch its nose in the next spiral 
nebula. Still, maybe they didn’t 
think it important to mention it. 
Different people, different ways, 
you know. It takes all kinds to 
make a universe.” 

“Well, dammit!” said the Prime 
Minister. “Isn’t there any organi- 
zation with the job of finding new 
cultures?” 

“Oh, yes — Exploration,” re- 
plied Bligh. “But they’re mostly 
a bunch of hobbyists in actual 
fact, you understand. I mean — 
no great purpose in finding an- 
other new culture when there’s 
so many around to begin with. 
They might be poking around 
here; and then they might decide 
to poke around there. Lots of 
places, you know, where a new 
race might pop up.” 

This announcement seemed to 
throw the meeting temporarily 
into silence. Then the Secretary 
of the Certain Party leaned over 
and whispered in the ear of the 
President of the United States, 
who drew the other two into a 
huddle, which ended with them 
all resuming their places and the 
President facing Bligh again. 

“I ask for all of us,” said the 
President, “whether you are truly 
representative of the intelligence 
and culture of the normal mem- 

46 



ber of the Confraternity?” 

“Not at all, not at all,” Bligh 
hurried to assure him. “There’s 
every conceivable kind of in- 
telligence and culture in the Con- 
fraternity. All kinds of life-forms. 
All kinds and types of intelli- 
gences.” 

There was a moment’s silence. 

“Then what — ” demanded the 
Secretary, sp>eaking up unexp>ect- 
edly and gutturally on his own, 
“do they have in common be- 
tween them?” 

“Love,” replied Bligh blissfully. 
“Their mutual love and affection.” 

There was another short si- 
lence. 

“Love each other, eh?” grunted 
the Prime Minister. 

“Yes,” said Bligh, “just as they 
will love you humans if you ' be- 
come a part of the Confraternity.” 

A LL FOUR national represen- 
tatives withdrew into another 
conference. Little telepathic 
snatches of conversation reached 
the mind of Captain Bligh — 
“The U.N., of course — but the 
circumstances — decadent capi- 
talistic emotion — now, my dear 
fellow, be reasonable — ” but he 
very politely ignored them. 

The President broke from the 
huddle and once more ap- 
proached Bligh. 

“Naturally,” he said, “none of 
us here disparage love as a de- 
sirable acquisition, where one 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



people are concerned with others. 
But — er — there is the practi- 
cal side to any alliance — a ques- 
tion of tangibles — ” 

“Tangibles? Why, of course!” 
cried Bligh. “It’s with tangibles 
that the United Peoples of the 
Confraternity will wish to express 
their love toward you. Grants-in- 
aid and rehabilitation funds from 
the Galactic Treasury — dona- 
tions of up-to-date equipment and 
supplies. Technical assistance, of 
course.” 

“Of course?” said four voices 
at once. 

“For little things. Merely to 
raise your standard of living to 
average Confraternity level,” said 
Captain Bligh. “Electronic power 
plants — am I correct in assum- 
ing you have not yet cracked the 
electron? — force shields, weath- 
er control units, drugs to conquer 
all your diseases and reverse the 
process of aging — all these little 
home comforts will be donated 
to you as a matter of course.” 

The four humans looked at 
each other. 

“And — ” continued Bligh, “you 
will want to hook on to the abso- 
lutely free Galaxy-wide transpor- 
tation system. A terminal will be 
set up on your Moon immediate- 
ly. You will find,” said Captain 
Bligh with a roguish telepathic 
twinkle, “many pleasant vacation 
spots in the Galaxy with all con- 
veniences furnished free of charge 



by the local life-form.” 

He stopped speaking. For a 
moment, nobody said anything. 
Then the President cleared his 
throat and spoke. 

“And what kind of tangibles,” 
he said, “would the Confraternity 
expect us to express our love 
with?” 

“Tangibles? From you? My 
dear human!” cried Bligh. “What 
are material things compared to 
the pure emotion of love? Tangi- 
bles can’t buy happiness. After 
all, it’s love that makes the Uni- 
verse go around.” He telepathed 
a quick shake of the head. “No. 
No. You people will give in re- 
turn only the rare quality of your 
affection.” 

T he four men looked doubt- 
ful. 

“Believe me,” went on Captain 
Bligh, earnestly, “out in the Uni- 
verse, material things are nothing 
and less than nothing. With so 
many differing races, how could 
a material standard be set up 
common to all? Useless and less 
than useless. That is why, among 
the stars, the common currency 
is love and a people are rated on 
the quantity and quality of their 
capability for affection.” He 
beamed at them. “Permit me to 
say that you people strike me as 
having great capabilities along 
that line. I’ve only had a chance 
to glance at things here, but judg-

ing from your movies, your books 
and magazines — ” 

“Ahem!” said the President, 
clearing his throat abruptly. 
“Well, now, I must admit you 
paint an attractive picture. Cap- 
tain. If you’ll excuse us again for 
a minute — ” 

Captain Bligh waved a grace- 
fully assenting tentacle, and the 
four humans withdrew into an- 
other huddle. After a few mo- 
ments of animated conversation, 
they returned to Bligh. 

“I have been deputed to say, 
for all of us,” said the President 
of the United States, “that while, 
as I have mentioned before, there 
is nothing official about this little 
meeting or ourselves, certainly 
there seems to be no conceivable 
reason why we humans should 
not respond with affection to af- 
fection freely given by others.” 

“My dear sir!” cried Bligh, de- 
lighte.d. “How well you put it. I 
was sure you would agree.” His 
gaze took in them all. “It was 
inevitable. While I’m not a par- 
ticularly perceptive being, as be- 
ings go, it seemed to me that I 
could see Love and Affection hov- 
ering around you all like an aura. 
How right I was. Gentlemen, the 
Universe is yours, just as soon 
as you make your adjustment.” 

“Adjustment?” said the Prime 
Minister. 

“Of course. But a mere baga- 
telle. A nothing,” said Captain 

48 



Bligh. “A mere matter of love 
extended logically to include all 
living creatures. A moment’s ad- 
justment by a metabolic ordina- 
tor, completely painless. Click- 
snap and it’s over and you are 
all energy eaters.” 

“Eaters of what?” said the 
President of France. 

“Energy. My dear sirs,” said 
Captain Bligh. “You surely would 
not wish to continue with your 
present diets. How could you eat 
something you love? And love, 
like charity, begins at home. 
Moreover — ” he went on — 
“how could you expect the rest 
of the Universe to accept you 
otherwise? Consider the similarity 
of shapes. For example, what a 
Red-eyed Inchos would think on 
arriving to set up a modern 
weather control system for your 
planet, if he should see one of 
you sitting down to — ” the Cap- 
tain shuddered — “a roast turkey, 
except for a slight difference in 
size, the exact image of himself. 
Similarly with a Lullar and a 
barbecued pig, or a Brvandig and 
a baked sturgeon.” 

A fter a moment, the Presi- 
dent of the United States 
cleared his throat. 

“Perhaps — ” he suggested, “a 
strictly vegetarian — ” 

“Mr. President,” said Bligh, in- 
terrupting with dignity, “I am 
myself only one of uncounted 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



myriads, but some of my best 
friends are plants.” He fixed the 
President with a stern eye. “I 
hate to think what a Snurlop 
would say if he happened to see 
a loaf of your bread and imagined 
a child of his own being harvest- 
ed, threshed, ground and even 
baked!” 

“But now — ” interposed the 
President of France hastily, “cer- 
tainly liquids such as wine — ” 
“Please!” choked Bligh, turn- 
ing green. He staggered and 
leaned against the desk beside 
him. Hastily the President of the 
United States fanned the Cap*- 
tain’s face with a major-general’s 
appointment that happened to be 
lying close at hand. Slowly, the 
color returned to Bligh’s gums. 

“Please,” he repeated feebly, 
“amputation, crushing, fermenta- 
tion — horrible.” He shook his 
head. “No — no liquids.” 

“Water,” said the Prime Min- 
ister. 

Bligh looked at him. “Think,” 
he said, “just think of the minute 
organisms that must die, either 
through being boiled alive, poi- 
soned with chlorine, or digested 
living, to provide you with ordi- 
nary drinking water. Why, the 
Fellibriks of — ” 

“Yes, yes,” interrupted the 
President hastily, “I’m sure your 
little friends would be shocked. 
If you will excuse us just once 
more — ” 



“Certainly,” replied Bligh, 
faintly, sagging against the desk. 

Stout sports-being as he was, 
the images just conjured up by 
the recent conversation had 
turned him pale inside (he was 
incapable of turning pale out- 
side). As he breathed heavily 
and tried to recover, little bits 
of conversation reached him. 

“Borscht — civet de lapin — 
rare steak — roast beef and Y ork- 
shire pudding — sacrifice — 
solidarity — ” 

Slowly, but with the look of 
men who have been through the 
fire and emerged triumphant, the 
four representatives of humanity 
turned back to the representative 
of the Galactic Confederation of 
Races. 

O THAT IS how peace has 
come to the world. We are 
united at last as we have never 
before been in history, united as 
one people behind what has come 
to be known as the UnBligh Doc- 
trine, and which is now emblaz- 
oned in letters of gold over the 
front doors of the U.N. Building. 

No government or individual 
or collection of individuals shall 
have the power at any time to 
come between any other individ- 
ual and the due and lawful exer- 
cise of his appetite. 

Let the Galactic Confederation 
of Races beware!

By JAMES E. GUNN 

To find a thief in a society where crime 
does not exist, there is only one answer 
—manufacture a thief to catch the thief I 




A t 2:30 P.M. on Monday, 
October 21, 2055, I be- 
came a deviant — I left 
my job half an hour early. 

I called my Department Direc- 
tor and told him I wasn’t feeling 
well. It wasn’t exactly a lie or I 
couldn’t have told it, but it was 



so close to one that I fidgeted ner- 
vously in my chair, facing the 
screen. 

I wasn’t feeling well, true — 
but it was all in my head. 

The Director looked at me 
shrewdly. His name was Foreman; 
he had a dark face and black, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




bristling eyebrows that almost 
met over his nose. He had been 
Director for only a year. If there 
had been such a thing as dislike, 
I would have disliked him. As it 
was, he made my back stiffen and 
my throat tighten, which was a 
strange talent in an executive. 



But he had a talent for char- 
acter analysis, which was why 
he was Director instead of a Stat- 
istician 1st Class like me, and he 
asked, “How long has it been 
since you’ve seen your analyst?” 
“Five years,” I replied. 

“That’s too long. Norm,” he 



TSYLAN A 



51 




said, taking a kindly interest. 
“This might be psychosomatic.” 

“I resent that,” I snapped, feel- 
ing my circulation speed up and 
my face grow warm. “My child- 
hood was just as scientific as 
yours.” 

He had used a nasty word and 
he knew it. I realized immedi- 
ately that he had used it deliber- 
ately for its shock value and my 
reaction had confirmed his snap 
diagnosis. 

“Of course. Norm,” he soothed. 
“Everyone’s was. Just call me a 
cautious old fool and see an an- 
alyst for my sake. Okay?” 

That was different. It was an 
order and I naturally would obey 
it. “Okay,” I said quickly, not giv- 
ing him a chance to specify what 
analyst and when. 

I WAITED in the privacy of 
my office until the publicroom 
registered empty and walked 
through quickly to the public- 
door. Automatically, I punched 
the time clock. My premature 
departure would show up in the 
statistics, but for the first time in 
my life I didn’t care. 

“Norm has departed from the 
norm,” I thought, and chuckled. 
I hadn’t laughed like that since 
I was a child, and I stopped sud- 
denly. It was a bad sign. The 
basis of humor is surprise and 
disappointed expectation; neither 
of them have any place in a 

52 



well-run world or a well-ordered 
personality. 

I crossed the publichall to the 
elevator that was waiting and 
stopped, shocked. There was al- 
ready someone in the elevator — 
a small, round, middle-aged stran- 
ger with a silvery thatch of hair 
cut short. His astonishment at my 
careless intrusion on his privacy 
was obvious, but he recovered 
quickly. 

As I was stepping back, mum- 
bling my apologies, he said gently, 
“Wait, brother.” I waited. “You’ve 
got troubles, brother,” he went on 
with impersonal kindness. “See 
an analyst! Don’t wait another 
twenty-four hours! Meanwhile, be 
my guest.” 

Overwhelmed by his benevo- 
lence, I accepted his offer and 
rode with him to the publicfloor 
in silence. As we parted he handed 
me a yellowed piece of stiff paper 
and said cryptically, “If life ain’t 
dandy, see Andy.” 

After his silvery head had dis- 
appeared in the crowd outside, I 
looked at the paper. It said: 



ANDREW Q. REDNIK 
Freelance Analyst 
and 

Public Headshrinker 



I shrugged, crumpled it in my 
hand and looked around for a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



publican. I couldn’t find any. I 
stuck it in my pocket and for- 
got about it; I had more import- 
ant worries. 

I put on my publicface and 
merged with the crowd moving 
past Statistical Center. The street, 
of course, is common and there 
is no right of privacy there. In 
the street, we are anonymous. 

I maneuvered myself into the 
subway stream and rode home in 
the proper manner, my arms 
folded across my chest, my eyes, 
behind their one-way glasses, fixed 
on a spot just above the head of 
the farthest person. My thoughts 
were torment. 

I was a Statistician 1st Class. 
It was a good thing to be and I 
was contented with it. Naturally. 
The annual Examinations had 
tested me, classified me and 
placed me, as they had everyone. 
Statistician 1st Class was the 
ideal position for a person with 
my intelligence and psychological 
profile. 

A n almost forgotten economic 
theory had an excellent aph- 
orism : From everyone accord- 
ing to his ability — to everyone 
according to his need. It hadn’t 
worked for those almost forgotten 
economists; it wasn’t an economic 
theory — it was a psychological 
concept and they had no means 
whatever of determining a per- 
son’s ability or his need. 



That was before Kinder made 
psychology a science and pro- 
duced a society that worked. 
Everyone had a job that suited 
his talents and his psychological 
needs, and everyone was happy 
because his needs were satisfied. 

Children were raised scientific- 
ally and, when they were grown, 
they were treated as human be- 
ings, with certain inalienable 
rights. A society so built could 
not help but be happy. 

For one hundred years, the 
world had rocked along on an 
even keel. It did not go anywhere 
or want to; it already was there. 
Everybody was happy instead of 
swinging back and forth from 
gloom to ecstasy. 

Ecstasy is a dangerous emotion. 
As a statistician, I knew that all 
things balance out. Ecstasy must 
be paid for in misery. And it is 
the extremes that really rock the 
boat and threaten society. 

So I worked with the things I 
loved — the Computer, numbers, 
graphs — in a reasonably happy 
world and everything was rosy 
and private. 

Until a week ago. Then it was 
still private but bleak. 

Because I was what I was, I 
noticed it. Because I was what 
I was, I knew what it meant and I 
kept it to myself. 

Now, because I was what I 
was, I had to do something about 
it. 



TSYLANA

My home was a conventional 
side-by-side duplex. I entered the 
common and went into my quar- 
ters and sat down at my desk. I 
waited long enough for my wife 
to notice that I was home — in 
case she was entertaining a lover 
— and then I punched for com- 
panionship. 

Ordinarily a wife is the last 
person a man would choose, but 
I had to talk to somebody. 

In a moment, the screen bright- 
ened. My wife’s face appeared in 
it. 

It seemed concerned; at an- 
other time, I would have worried 
about causing it. Naida was a 
good wife, mated to me intellec- 
tually and emotionally, and beau- 
tiful in my eyes. 

“Norm!” she exclaimed. “What’s 
the matter? You’re home twenty- 
five minutes early.” 

“If you aren’t occupied,” I said 
formally, “I’d like the pleasure 
of your company.” 

“So early?” she asked, her eyes 
wide and startled. 

“If it is congenial,” I said stiffly. 

“Of course,” she said hurriedly. 
“It’s just — I mean — five min- 
utes?” 

O NLY three minutes later, 
she swept into the common 
in her laciest negligee, looking un- 
usually beautiful and desirable, 
but my mind was too troubled to 
be drawn off on a tangent. 



“I’ve just uncovered a crime 
wave,” I said miserably. 

Disappointment wip>ed her 
smile away and then her features 
assumed a prop>er expression of 
tender attention. “What’s crime?” 
she asked. 

I was ready; I had asked the 
Computer. “An action that threat- 
ens the structure of society and 
is condemned by law.” 

“Like invasion of privacy?” 
she said brightly. 

“Worse, Naida,” I groaned. 
“Much worse.” 

“What could be worse than 
invasion of privacy?” 

“Theft,” I said in a low, harsh 
voice. 

“Theft?” 

“Taking something that doesn’t 
belong to you.” 

“But I don’t see how that could 
be worse than invasion of pri — ” 

“Invasion of privacy,” I inter- 
rupted with inexcusable impa- 
tience, “can be thoughtless or 
accidental. Theft demands intent; 
it indicates a basic perversion of 
character.” 

It had been such a small thing 
at the start. Only a statistician 
would have seen it; only a statis- 
tician would have found it mean- 
ingful. A statistician works with 
figures day after day. There is 
a rhythm to statistics that sings 
to his inner ear, sweetly, sooth- 
ingly; a dissonance is a frightful 
thing. 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Statistical analysis was the 
vital job of my world. Everyone 
felt that way about his work, of 
course, but in the case of statis- 
tical analysis it was true. The 
duty of every society is to es- 
tablish a norm and to correct 
marked deviations from it. In 
my world, statistical analysis es- 
tablished the norm and the an- 
alysts did the correction — what 
there was of it. 

Last Monday, I had been 
scanning the Computer’s daily 
summary. Everything had been 
going smoothly: 1,173,476 gal. 
water purified/ 1,173,476 gal. wa- 
ter consumed; 9,328 births/9,328 
deaths . 

And finally, at the bottom of 
the sheet: 1 candy reward taken 
from baby. 

“Without consent?” Naida 
asked. 

“How could the child consent? 
It couldn’t even talk!” 

“But that wasn’t in the sum- 
mary.” 

“No, I got the details from the 
nursery. The foster-mother had 
just given the reward to the child 
for compassionate behavior and 
had left him to enjoy it in 
privacy. His angry wails brought 
her back. The reward was gone. 
Someone walking past had snatch- 
ed it from the baby’s hands. The 
child was furious; his social de- 
velopment received a setback that 
will take years to overcome. Al- 



though he could not describe the 
thief, the child exhibited a sharp 
and unwarranted suspicion of the 
nursery analyst. Presumably the 
thief was a man.” 

“How awful!” Naida shuddered. 
“It might have been one of our 
children.” 

T FROWNED at her. “Not ours, 
Naida. Society’s children. We 
have no right to make emotional 
claims on them — no right, there- 
fore, even to know which of them 
is ours. All children are our 
children; all men are our 
brothers.” 

“Yes, Norm,” she said duti- 
fully. “Norm,” she went off on 
her own tangent, “could we have 
another? Child, I mean?” 

I sighed heavily; it was a fa- 
miliar question. “Our request is 
in, Naida. What else can I do? 
All right,” I added hastily, “I’ll 
ask again about the quota for 
our genetic bracket.” 

“Norm,” Naida said distantly, 
“I think I’ll apply for nursery 
duty.” ' 

I sighed again. “Yes, dear.” 
Every month she applied, and 
every month she was turned 
down. She had the wrong psy- 
chological profile for the nursery; 
she couldn’t help smothering the 
children with sticky, indiscrimi- 
nate mother love and creating all 
sorts of fixations and complexes 
in them. The analysts would

sooner have admitted a hooded 
cobra. 

“Candy from a baby!” she said, 
switching back with mercurial 
ease. “That’s terrible! But it 
doesn’t seem so very serious.” 

I massed my thoughts for a 
frontal assault on the fortress of 
her understanding. “Society is a 
delicately balanced mechanism. 
Societies in motion can absorb 
and dampen harmful vibrations, 
but our society is at rest. One 
anti-social act makes it quiver; 
one anti-social individual can 
throw the whole thing out of 
alignment. 

“We aren’t organized to handle 
crime. We haven’t had a theft 
for seventy-five years — I asked 
the Computer. There aren’t even 
any laws against it. Incipient 
criminals are nipped in the nur- 
sery. We’re like a long-isolated 
community coming in contact 
with an infectious disease for 
which we have lost our immunity. 
The way the Polynesians did, we 
may succumb to measles and 
smallpox.” 

Naida’s eyes opened wide in an 
expression I had always found 
tremendously attractive; now it 
irritated me. “Goodness!” she ex- 
claimed. “We aren’t in danger of 
that, too?” 

“No, no! It was just a compari- 
son. 

I stopped to gather together 
my scattered thoughts. “That was 

56 



last Monday. The next day, a 
child’s walker was stolen from 
a nursery on the other side of 
town. Wednesday, a sack of mar- 
bles disappeared from the East 
Side. Thursday, a football was 
left overnight on a playing field; 
it wasn’t there in the morning. 
On Friday, it was a teen-ager’s 
convertible; on Saturday, the vir- 
ginity of a girl who was strolling 
through Central Park.” 

“But that’s silly! All he had 
to do was ask!” 

“Of course. But that wouldn’t 
have satisfied him.” 

Naida frowned thoughtfully. 
“It sounds exactly as if the thief 
were growing up.” 

“Sunday, he grew up,” I 
groaned. “He stole ten million dol- 
lars from the First National 
Bank.” 

N aida sank back in the love- 
seat, shocked. “How could he 
do that?” 

“No human tellers were pres- 
ent to check on the computer at 
the bank. When a routine series 
of drafts on the city’s general 
fund, signed with signatures iden- 
tical with those of the City Treas- 
urer, were presented at a public 
cash booth, the money, in small, 
untraceable bills, was delivered 
without question. The discrep- 
ancy was discovered this morn- 
ing.” 

“How do you know it wasn’t 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the Treasurer’s real signature?” 
“They were identical. Real sig- 
natures always have minor varia- 
tions.” I hesitated. “Or so the 
Computer said.” 

“What’s being done about it?” 
“Nothing. I tell you, Naida, we 
aren’t equipped to handle some- 
thing like this. They’re passing it 
off at City Hall as a clerical error. 
They think the money will turn 
up in another account.” 

Naida looked at me steadily 
with her large, violet eyes. “And 
you know better.” 

She said it firmly, but I had to 
justify myself all the same. “Don’t 
you see? It’s because I’m a stat- 
istician. Computers don’t make 
mistakes; only people do. Figures 
don’t lie. And statistics predict 
the future automatically. With 
me, extrapolation is second na- 
ture; I follow the curve to the 
next intersection and I know 
what’s coming. 

“Somewhere in this city is a 
man who will wreck our society 
thoroughly and permanently on 
the jagged rocks of his frustra- 
tions. No one but me can see it. 
If I don’t do something, this world 
of ours is gone. I’ve got to do 
something! Social consciousness 
is bred in me! I must protect 
society!” 

“Norm!” she said, some of my 
panic finally reaching her. “What 
are you going to do?” 

“That’s what’s bothering me,” I 



confessed. “I can’t track down a 
criminal; it’s not in my psycholog- 
ical profile. The bloodhound has 
been bred out of the human race, 
like all the rest of the socially de- 
structive impulses. Imagine the 
frustration of a detective with 
nothing to detect!” 

Naida wrinkled her forehead. 
“Isn’t there an old saying: It takes 
a thief to catch a thief?" 

I looked at her, startled. “Dar- 
ling!” I said, and caught her up in 
my arms. “That’s it. That’s the 
answer.” 

; She looked surprised, then 
pleased. The afternoon ended 
pretty much the way she had 
expected, after all. 

^ I ■’HE SIGN on the door was an 
old one. The gilt had p>eeled 
away long ago, leaving only a 
black outline that read:

The building was old, too, a 
relic of pre-analytic days, a green- 
glass-and-aluminum eyesore, very 
pigeon-specked. 

As far as I could tell, Andrew 
Q. Rednik was the only tenant 
left in the towering monstrosity. 
Why he had an office on the thir- 
ty-seventh floor, I couldn’t un- 
derstand.

The elevators were all sealed 
and hung with tattered signs; 
Out of Order. I had climbed 
all thirty-seven flights of stairs 
and I wheezed in front of the 
door, not feeling well — not feel- 
ing well at all. 

A small sign by an old-fashion- 
ed door knob said: Grin and 
come in. I went in, but I didn’t 
grin. The waiting room was peel- 
ing chrome and split plastic. 

Faded signs were tacked all 
over the walls: 

DON’T KID WITH YOUR ID! 

EVEN MOSES 
HAD NEUROSES 

I would have turned right 
around and gone back down those 
thirty-seven flights of stairs, but 
Rednik was the only freelance 
analyst listed in the directory. 
That was the disadvantage of 
nonconformity. It was also the ad- 
vantage, I reflected with scrupu- 
lous fairness. Without Rednik, I 
would have been helpless; no oth- 
er analyst would risk the uncer- 
tainties and inevitable frustra- 
tions of freelance existence. 

There was an inner door. It 
was closed. There was a sign on 
it, too: Sit down and consider 
your symptoms. The analyst will 
be with you in a moment. 

I started searching for the chair 
with the fewest splits in the bot- 
tom. Before I had it picked out. 



the inner door opened and Red- 
nik stuck his head out, looking 
wise and benevolent like an ex- 




tinct, snow-capped volcano. 
“Rednik?” I asked. 

“It ain’t Santa Claus, brother.” 
“Who?” 

“Never mind,” he said. “You 
wouldn’t remember.”

¥N HIS office, he had an 
antique steel-and-plastic desk 
and a traditional red-leather 
couch. On second glance, the 
couch seemed more original than 
traditional. On the ceiling above 
it, where the eyes of the recum- 
bent patient would naturally rest. 



was still another sign: Don’t 

second-^uess the analyst! 

“Now, boy, what’s the trouble?” 
Rednik inquired paternally. 

I sank into the ancient chair 
opposite the desk. “I’ve got to do 
something,” I said desperately, 
“and it isn’t in my profile.”

“Naturally” 

“What’s natural about it?” 
‘Why else would you come to 
me? If it were in your profile, it 
would be done and forgotten.” He 
sighed. “That’s the one trouble 
with this world: there’s no one 
capable of handling the unexpec- 
ted. But then, if there were, it 
wouldn’t be this kind of world at 
all.” 

“Are you saying that there’s an 
advantage in being unadjusted?” 
“That depends on what you 
mean by advantage. If you mean 
happiness — no. If you mean 
power — there’s always an ad- 
vantage in being different, if you 
can handle it. In the country of 
the normal, the neurotic man is 
king.” He squinted at me shrewd- 
ly. “You want to be king?” 

“Of course not!” I protested, of- 
fended. “I’m happy the way things 
are — except for one little prob-- 
lem. I don’t want to change any- 
thing; I want to keep things from 
being changed. But I’ve got to 
find somebody, and when I find 
him, I’ve got to be able to do 
whatever is necessary.” 

“Ah!” Rednik said wisely. “The 
rabbit wants to become a tiger.” 
“A what?" 

“A manhunter!” 

“Oh. Yes.” 

His stubby fingers beat out a 
nervous rhythm on the desk. 
“You know what you’re asking me 
to do. This is against all the an- 



alytic regulations. It would mean 
my license if anyone found out.” 
“If you don’t do it,” I said 
somberly, “it may mean the end 
of the world.” 

He frowned at me specula- 
tively. “As bad as that?” 

“Every bit.” 

He slapped the desk deci- 
sively. “I’ll do it.” 

“Why?” I asked bluntly, sur- 
prising myself. Already my 
psychological profile must have 
changed under the frustrations of 
the resolved situation, for my 
question was a glaring invasion of 
privacy. 

"OUT Rednik took no offense. 

He waggled a roguish finger 
at me. “Ah-ah!” he chided. “Now 
you are trying to analyze me. Be 
patient.” He chuckled suddenly. 
“Get it? Don’t be an analyst! Be 
a patient!” 

I didn’t think it was the least 
bit funny. 

He chuckled again. “You’ll get 
your chance. But if you must 
have a reason, let us say for now 
that I’m bored.” 

“Bored? Then you aren’t in the 
right job.” 

“Or perhaps I’ve been in the 
right job too long.” 

I glanced nervously at my 
watch. “Well, let’s get started. 
I’ve got only two hours for lunch.” 
“We’ve started already. Don’t 
you feel repressions lifting their 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



snaky heads in your subcon- 
scious?” 

“Well, maybe,” I admitted re- 
luctantly. “But you haven’t done 
anything!” 

He sighed. “So we must be ac- 
tive about it, eh?” He got up 
from the desk and settled himself 
comfortably on the couch. Fold- 
ing his hands across tiis chest, he 
said, ‘Walk around back there 
where I can’t see you.” 

“But I’m the one who’s sup- 
posed to lie on the couch!” 

“That’s analysis, when you get 
your repressions removed!" he 
snapped, raising up on one elbow 
to scowl at me. “This is reverse 
analysis. Now walk around back 
there!” 

Annoyed, I went behind the 
couch while he got comfortable. 

“The first thing I can remem- 
ber,” he began in a distant, remi- 
niscing voice, “was when I was 
four years old. I saw my father 
kissing my mother and I ran over 
to them and hit my father. I 
kept yelling, ‘Let her go! You’re 
hurting her! I hate you! I hate 
you!’ After that, relations be- 
tween my father and me were 
a little strained — ” 

“Your father!” I exclaimed. 
“Your mother! What are you talk- 
ing about? You were living with 
them? What a nasty situation!” 
He turned and glared at me. 
“You aren’t very good at this sort 
of thing, are you? You’re sup- 



posed to listen, not comment.” 

I clamped my lips shut on an 
irritated retort. 

“When I was twenty-seven,” he 
went on easily, “I perfected 
analysis and revolutionized so- 
ciety — ” 

“What are you talking about?” 
I demanded indignantly. “Kinder 
perfected analysis a hundred 
years ago.” 

Wordlessly, he motioned to- 
ward the sign on the ceiling: 
Don’t second-guess the analyst! 

“I’m beginning to dislike you,” 
I growled. 

He beamed at me. “Fine. Soon 
it will blossom into loathing.” 

On the way back to Statistical 
Center, I followed a lone pigeon 
for two blocks. It finally got 
alarmed and flew away. 

T he sessions continued daily. 

Every day for a week, Red- 
nik lay comfortably on his red- 
leather couch, rambling inco- 
herently over an implausibly 
long and eventful existence, inci- 
dent by incident, in disgusting de- 
tail, while I paced the floor behind 
him, longing to impart confidences 
of my own. He kept cutting me 
off. 

Every day my repressions 
grew stronger and my disposition 
more touchy. I lost weight; I 
couldn’t sleep; illogical impulses 
swept over me periodically. 

I kept up my search for the 



TSYLAN A 



61 



thief, poring over the daily sum- 
maries in spite of a growing dis- 
taste for the Computer, numbers 
and graphs. But I couldn’t find 
another isolated statistic; the thief 
held his hand. 

I repeatedly asked myself a 
question that had no answer: 
What is there to steal when a 
a man has stolen ten million 
dollars? 

W'as I wrong? I wondered. 
VTas the thief satisfied, tna com- 
pulsion worked out? Was all my 
torment in vain? 

There were no answers to 
these, either. 

At home, I became brusque 
and tyrannical. I broke in on 
Naida unexpectedly with the tor- 
mented hope of finding her with 
a lover; when I was disappointed, 
as I always was, I stormed at 
her jealously anyway. When she 
was gone, I switched a couple of 
wires in her intercom so that it 
transmitted continuously, wheth- 
er the receiver was turned on 
or not. After that, I sat for hours 
watching her move about her 
quarters unaware. 

I found myself growing pas- 
sionately in love with my own 
wife. 

It was a vastly unsettling ex- 
perience. 

When I was at work, I called 
her several times a day. When I 
was home, I summoned her curtly 
at all hours. 



Finally I became completely 
anti-social: I moved her and her 
belongings into my own quarters 
and sealed up her half of the du- 
plex. 

Oddly enough, Naida seemed to 
bloom under this boorish treat- 
ment. She smiled constantly. 
Often, as she went about her daily 
tasks, pushing buttons, selecting 
menus, she would laugh and sing. 

Women are inexplicable. 

At the same time, I began de- 
veloping strange interests in other 
women. The first time, I saw a 
girl on the street and obeyed an 
impulse to follow her. I followed 
her halfway across town before 
she turned and asked pleasantly, 
“What is you want?” 

“You,” I said bluntly. 

She was too well raised, of 
course, to frustrate a fellow hu- 
man being. Only much later did 
I realize that I hadn’t even 
learned her name. 

rROM a man who was satis- 
fied with little, I became a 
tortured creature dissatisfied with 
abundance. Often I was unhappy. 
Sometimes I was miserable. And 
once or twice I felt the poignant 
stab of an ecstasy I had never 
dreamed. 

My only consolation was that 
I was sacrificing myself for my 
world. It had better be worth it, 
I thought bitterly. 

Still the thief did not strike.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The annual Examinations were 
upon me suddenly. In three days, 
I would submit my personality to 
their prodding and prying and 
precise judgments. I would do 
poorly. It would mean my job. 

Brooding, unhappy, I returned 
to Rednik and his horrid reve- 
lations once more. I forced 
myself to open ■ the door, my 
breath rasping in my throat. I 
closed it behind me and stared 
at it blindly for a moment, brac- 
ing myself for the ordeal that 
waited on the red-leather couch. 

My blurred eyes focused. I saw 
something I should have seen sev- 
en days before. 

The letters on the door spelled: 

KINDER Q. WERDNA 
tsylanA ecnaleerF 
dna 

reknirhsdaeH cilbuP 

I pronounced each word slowly. 
They made a kind of sense, like 
an ancient root language — like 
reverse analysis. A reverse ana- 
lyst, of course, is a tsyleina. A 
tsylana ecnaleerf. 

I shuddered. 

It made even more sense than 
that. Rednik — Kinder. Kinder 
— Rednik. It was the sort of 
thing a man would do who would 
put “Don’t Kid with Your Id!” on 
his waiting room wall. 

I burst through the inner door 
and said accusingly: “You’re Kin- 
der!” 



“That’s what I told you the first 
day,” he said blandly. 

.“Because you didn’t expect me 
to believe you.” 

He shrugged carelessly. “It was 
a matter of indifference whether 
you believed me or not.” 

“Everything you told me was 
true,” I said with a shaky, horri- 
fied voice. “All that fantastic as- 
semblage of enormities and atroc- 
ities.” 

“Perhaps. And, again, perhaps 
not.” 

His smile was infuriating. 

T SHIVERED with the chill fury 
of my it^ability to pin him 
down. If there had been a weap- 
on handy, I would have killed 
him without hesitation and with- 
out remorse. “I hate you!” I said 
violently. “Why? Why? Why 
make rules and then shatter 
them?” 

“Let me tell you a story,” he 
began. 

“Not that again!” 

“This is a different kind of 
story,” he went on, unperturbed. 
“Once upon a time, there was a 
Creator. He made a man and a 
woman, and He created a perfect 
place for them to live in. He 
called it Paradise. Every day. He 
looked out on Paradise and saw 
the same stupid, happy people, 
not wanting anything because 
everything was available, not go- 
ing anywhere because there was 



TSYIAN A 



63 



nowhere to go, unchanging be- 
cause there was no reason for 
change. 

“Finally He was tempted to 
create a little sin and therewith 
He gave his creatures change, 
misery, ecstasy and free will. For 
without sin, there is no free will; 
without evil, there is no choice.” 

I stared at him vacantly. I 
couldn’t stop thinking about a 
man named Kinder. “It’s a lie,” I 
said. “That would make you about 
a hundred and thirty years old. 
Nobody lives that long.” 

Rednik sighed. “One hundred 
and twenty-seven, boy. You didn’t 
listen good. And that isn’t un- 
usual in this era of the integrated 
personality. Lots of people will 
live that long. Doctors used to be 
familiar with diseases they called 
psychosomatic. Today it works 
the other way around: the mind 
makes the body well instead of 
sick. Well, boy, good-by,” he said 
abruptly. “The treatment is 
over.” 

“You mean I’m finished?” I 
exclaimed. 

“No. I’m finished. You’ve just 
begun. You have frustrations 
enough. Frustrations are like rab- 
bits, you know. From now on, they 
will breed themselves.” 

“But — ”I began, and the next 
moment he was gone. 

Only it wasn’t the next mo- 
ment. Two hours had passed in 
the flicker of a thought. I was 

64 



late getting back to the office 
and Foreman spoke sharply to 
me. 

It was completely frustrating. 

A GAIN and again, I went back 
to Rednik’s office, climbing 
the thirty-seven flights of stairs 
with painful persistence, but the 
place was as deserted as the rest 
of the building. The only change 
was a slowly deepening layer of 
dust on the signs, the desk and 
the red-leather couch. 

It was a constant irritation. 

But soon there was no time for 
that. The annual Examinations 
were at hand. For three nights, 
I did not sleep. I twisted in my 
pneumatic crib, trying to think of 
something I could do, but all I 
could think of was a foolish 
phrase that kept running through 
my mind on anap>estic feet: In 
the country of the normal, the 
neurotic man is king. 

But I wasn’t a king. I was so far 
from being king that I was going 
to lose my job, such as it was. I 
couldn’t even find the thief I had 
set out upon this cruel road to 
catch, for whom all this torment 
had been necessary. 

And then, the night before the 
Examinations, I sat up straight 
in my crib and shouted: “That’s 
it!” 

A few days before, I would 
have hurried to the analyst if I 
had started talking to myself. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“That’s what?” mumbled Na- 
ida, startled out of her sleep, sit- 
ting up beside me looking quite 
beautiful. 

But my eyes were filled with 
another vision. “Shhh!” I said. 
“Go back to sleep!” 

“Yes, dear,” she said meekly. 

I got up, dressed quickly and 
hurried to the office. It was ghost- 
ly at that time of night, but I soon 
forgot my environment. I was too 
busy formulating a question for 
the Computer. 

The Computer was, actually. 
Statistical Center, and the offices 
in it were little cavities scooped 
out of the giant brain. Statistics 
is the common denominator of 
all phenomena and the Computer 
knew everything — including the 
questions asked in previous Ex- 
aminations and the weighting of 
the answers. 

It could compare the questions 
and answers of earlier Examina- 
tions, graph their evolution and 
extrapolate the questions that 
would be asked this year and the 
answers I needed. My job was 
to phrase that order in Computer 
language. 

It took me until dawn. 

The moment I set it in, fhe 
Computer started chattering. A 
sheaf of papers began piling up 
on my desk. 

It was a shock: the Computer 
was fast, but not that fast... There 
had to be another answer, a two- 



part answer: (1) this was no ex- 
trapolation; the questions and an- 
swer for this year’s Examina- 
tions were already on file; and 
(2) someone had already asked 
for them. 

T IFE HAD become very con- 
fusing lately. For a society 
planned from womb to tomb, 
where there was a place for every- 
one and everyone was in his 
place, it was presenting me with 
a lot of surprises. 

I picked up the sheaf of pajjers, 
folded them and stuffed them in- 
to my blouse. A man could have 
any position in the world, I 
thought. All he had to do was 
to ask the Computer. 

No normal person would, of 
course. That would be cheating. 
And no normal person would 
want a position for which he was 
not suited. 

But, then, my thief was not 
normal. 

Neither was I. 

I assumed my publicface and 
moved with the growing crowd 
to the giant, sprawling Examina- 
tions building. I submitted my 
profile card to a scanner. It 
clucked out a cubicle assignment. 
I would quickly become lost, try- 
ing to find it, but loudsjjeakers 
called out directions constantly: 
“ONE-A TURN RIGHT; ONE-B TURN 
LEFT. IF YOU HAVE A RED CARD, 
YOU ARE IN THE WRONG WING; 



TS YLAN A 



65 



TURN AROUND AND GO BACK TO 
THE FIRST CORRIDOR PAINTED RED 
AND FOLLOW IT TO THE END.” 

I sank wearily into the cubicle’s 
padded chair. It was lucky I had 
the answers; I was in no condition 
to figure them out for myself. 

There was a slot for my pro- 
file card. As soon as I had pushed 
the card into it, the Examina- 
tions began. On the screen in 
front of me, the following ques- 
tion appeared: 

T here are many types of 
pleasure and we do not all like 
the same things. Of the following 
activities, choose the one which 
would please you the most: 

1) Eating a delicious meal 

2) Finishing a difficult job 

2) Supervising a large op- 
eration 

4) Bringing pleasure to a 
friend 

5) Making love to a beauti- 
ful woman 

I stared at the choices blankly, 
unable to decide which of them 
I would really prefer, unable even 
to determine which of them I 
should prefer. I slipp>ed the sheaf 
of papers out of my blouse and 
found the first question. The 
right choice was 4. 

¥ SIGHED and punched the 
fourth button on the panel un- 
der the screen and had a horrid 

66 



thought: Had the Computer un- 
derstood me? 

There was one outcome of the 
Examinations that nobody talked 
about: elimination. It was a sort 
of artificial selection of desired 
characteristics. 

I shuddered and forced myself 
to go on. The next question had 
appeared and I had to answer it. 

So it went, question after ques- 
tion, for three days, eight hours a 
day. After a few hours, the brain 
became so numb that the instinc- 
tive response was the only one 
possible. 

But I had the answers — the 
right answers, I prayed. After a 
while, I stopped reading the ques- 
tions and checked off numbers. 

I slipped once. I waited ner- 
vously in my office after the Ex- 
aminations were finished and 
finally my new profile was de- 
livered with a pneumatic thunk. 
I ripp>ed open the cardboard con- 
tainer and read: 

The enclosed card has a mag- 
netic reproduction of your new 
psychological profile and will be- 
come part of your permanent re- 
cords. It indicates that you have 
a high altruism index and that 
your proper position is political 
leadership, 99.98% certain. There 
was only one higher index in the 
Examinations. 

A new position, therefore, has 
been created for you. Beginning 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tomorrow, you will fill the post- 
tion of Deputy Mayor. 

A cold elation filled my emo- 
tional centers. I let it spill over 
freely, because I had done what 
I set out to do. I had found the 
thief. 

Symbolic thefts had not been 
enough for him. He had stolen, 
finally, the most significant thing 
available in this political subdi- 
vision: power. 

Tomorrow, justice would catch 
up with the criminal. 

Today, I would be busy. Just 
before quitting time, I located my 
new office in City Hall and put 
in a call to the Mayor. A little 
blonde secretary with an interest- 
ingly full lower lip answered. 

“Is the new Mayor in?” I in- 
quired cautiously. 

“He’s been here, sir, and gone. 
Will you leave a message?” 

“No. I’ll see him in the morn- 
ing.” I would, too, I thought grim- 
ly- 

I went over the Mayor’s office 
inch by inch and drawer by 
drawer. Next morning, I returned 
before ten and had plenty of time 
to do what was necessary before 
anyone arrived. 

T¥7HEN the Mayor’s summons 
” arrived, I was ready. I 
walked steadily down the narrow 
private corridor to his office, feel- 
ing a little breathless but under 



remarkable control for the cir- 
cumstances. I knocked at his door. 
A moment later, it slid aside. 

“You!” I cried. 

The new Mayor was Foreman. 
His black eyebrows knitted them- 
selves together over his nose as 
he said, almost simultaneously, 
“What are you doing here?” 

I recovered first. “I’m the new 
Deputy Mayor.” 

“Fantastic!” 

“No more fantastic than you 
jumping to head of my depart- 
ment and then Mayor of the city.” 

“I’ve always been an executive. 
You’re a statistician." 

“I was a statistician.” 

I watched the statement soak 
in through several layers of pre- 
conceptions. His eyes were sud- 
denly startled. “So! The old screw- 
ball sent somebody after me. I 
should have got rid of him when 
I had a chance.” 

“Rednik?” 

His hand was below desk level. 
‘Who else?” He raised his hand; 
in it was something blue, com- 
plicated and metallic. “And you 
just walk right in and announce 
yourself!” 

‘What’s that?” I asked sharply. 

“The card in the museum case 
called it a pistol. It propels ex- 
plosive pellets by expansion of 
gases.” 

“Once a thief, always a thief,” 
I sneered. 

“Exactly. And now I’m going 



TSYLANA 



67 




to commit the ultimate theft — 
I’m going to steal your life.” 
“You can’t get away with it.” 
“Of course I can. Who would 
question me if I said you suddenly 
went mad and blew yourself up?” 
He grinned suddenly. “In the 
country of the normal, -the neu- 

68 



rotic man is king.” 

“I don’t understand,” I said. 
“How did you slip through? 
You’re what happ>ened to me. 
What happened to you?” 

“Who knows? Rednik said it 
was an imstable genetic pattern 
collapsing under the psychic 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stresses of approaching middle 
age, but he was full of it up to 
his neck. Whatever it was, it 
made me cheat the Examinations 
into giving me a job I couldn’t 
handle. I looked up Rednik. Every 
afternoon, he came to my office. 
I hated him!” 

“Even then you were stealing 
time.” 

tFE GRINNED. “Don’t think 
you can make me forget what 
I’m going to do. You’re going to 
get it. Now.” His hand tightened 
on the gun. 

“You can’t do it,” I said. “You’re 
a thief, not a murderer. Your 
conditioning is too strong for you 
to defy.” 

“Don’t bet on it!” he got out 
between clenched teeth. He put 
his left hand on the pistol to help 
the right hand squeeze. 

I watched him interestedly. 
“It’s no use anyway.” I said cas- 
ually. “I came in early this morn- 
ing and packed the barrel full of 
quick-setting plastic cement.” 

“Now I know you’re lying. I’m 
not going to look at it and give 
you a chance to jump me.” He 
squeezed the trigger, 

I dived to the floor as the frag- 
ments flew over my head. 

He had a strangely peaceful 
expression on his face when he 
died. Rednik had taught me this: 
the truth can be more deceptive 
than a lie. 



The office was suddenly filled 
with people, forgetful of manners 
and propriety. “What happened? 
What happened?” asked the littje 
blonde secretary. And then, more 
politely, “I beg your pardon for 
this intrusion, sir, but there was 
a loud noise in here.” 

I stared at her for a moment, 
speechless, struck by a sudden vi- 
sion of the future. It was not at 
all what I had once imagined, 
but it would be interesting. The 
secretary would help me make it 
so, I was sure. 

“A very sad thing,” I said 
gravely. ‘The Mayor was demon- 
strating an ancient weapon and it 
exploded.” 

“He’s dead?” she gasped and 
looked at me with wide blue eyes. 
‘Then you’ll be Mayor!” 

“Why,” I exclaimed in mock 
surprise, “so I will!” 

1’T WAS almost quitting time 
-^before the mess was cleaned up 
and I could relax behind the 
Mayor’s desk. 

Mayor! The word had a good 
sound to it. Governor sounded bet- 
ter, though. And President was 
best of all. 

But they would have to wait 
their turn. 

I chuckled. In the country of 
the normal, the neurotic man is 
king. 

But for some obscure reason, I 
couldn’t relax. I couldn’t under- 



TSYLANA 



69 



stand why. I had found my thief 
and punished him. I had power 
and the promise of more power. 
What more could a neurotic 
want? 

What about Rednik-Kinder? I 
thought. What was he doing? 
Was he lying on a couch some- 
where, working his twisted magic 
on some new patient? Was he 
creating another neurotic to come 
after me? 

I flipped open the switch of the 
office communicator. “Attention, 
everyone. In view of the emer- 
gency, office hours will be until 
four o’clock today.” I called Per- 
sonnel. “I want two strong men 
with quick reflexes and high loy- 
alty indexes. And I want all pub- 
lic records searched for a free- 
lance analyst named Rednik or 
Kinder. Or any freelance analyst 
at all.” 

There, I thought, that should 
do it! 

But I still couldn’t relax. I 
twisted in my pneumatic crib 
that night until Naida snuggled 
up to me and said, “What’s the 
matter, darling? Can’t you sleep?” 

I pushed her away roughly. 
“No!” 

I knew what I lacked : security. 
There was no security for a neu- 
rotic. If he had security, he would 
not be a neurotic. 

Even if I found Rednik-Kinder 
and got rid of him somehow, it 
woudn’t do me any good. The 



measures I had taken to find him 
and to protect myself would cre- 
ate imbalances which would lead 
inevitably to my destruction. 

My world was no longer the 
country of the normal. Society 
was on the move again, picking 
up speed before the winds of pas- 
sion, blowing across unknown seas 
toward some unknown destina- 
tion. 

There was one saying Rednik- 
Kinder had forgotten to tell me: 
Uneasy lies the head that wears 
the crown.

THE HOLLOW EARTH 

A bout two years ago, I re- 
ceived in the mails an en- 
velope postmarked Lin- 
dau, which I knew to be a town 
near Lake Constance. It was 
adorned with two rubber stamps: 
one was simply the name and ad- 
dress of the sender; the other said 
(in German, of course), “Do not 
throw away. Please pass this on.” 
Inside were two small pamphlets, 
one in German and one in Eng- 
lish, both substantially the same, 
advertising matter for three books 
written by one Karl Neupert. 
Below Mr. Neupert’s picture

was added in ink: “Died Febru- 
ary 8, 1949.” The books I was 
supposed to buy and the new 
Weltanschauung to which I was 
to be converted were something 
that really was no longer news to 
me. 

I had made their acquaintance 
around 1925, when bookstores 
were supplied with posters that 
promised to show the E^rth and 
the Universe — yes, that’s right, 
the Earth and the Universe — as 
it “really” was. The just-discov- 
ered secret of creation was that 
both were the same. 

The Earth, Mr. Neupert said, 
was actually hollow and, while its 
diameter was about 7950 miles as 
geographers have asserted for 
quite some time, we lived on the 
inside of this hollow Earth. And 
the hollow Earth also contained 
the Universe. 

In the center of the hollow 
Earth there floated a sphere, a 
thousand miles or so in diameter, 
which was either black or very 
dark blue. Luminous points repre- 
senting the constellations and the 
Milky Way were attached to this 
sphere and around it moved the 
Sun and the planets, all of them 
much smaller than astronomers 
thought. 

When the Sun was on one side 
of this sphere, the opposite half 
of the Earth had night, since the 
sphere was material and cast a 
shadow. Then, in the course Of 12 

72 



hours, the Sun moved around the 
central sphere — called “Phantom 
Universe” — and naturally the 
other half of the “Inner Earth” 
had daylight. 

I don’t recall whether it was 
stated or not just what the “Phan- 
tom Universe” consisted of, but I 
do recall that it was forbidden to 
ask what was outside the “world 
egg,” to use Mr. Neupert’s own 
term for the whole. He modestly 
said that even he could not an- 
«wer that question. 

HE English-language pam- 

phlet began with the words: 
“The Heavens? Illusion! The Im- 
mense Universe: Absurdity! The 
Earth is a Cosmic Cell, Universe 
Inside. We live on the Inside Sur- 
face.” The illustration was the 
same as that on the German pam- 
phlet, with only one minor 




The hoHow Earth as canceived by Dr. 
Edmond Halley.

change: in the German pamphlet, 
Europe had daylight; in the Eng- 
lish pamphlet, the Americas had 
daylight, a fine point from which 
I concluded that the publisher did 
not expect many sales in Great 
Britain. 

Herr Karl Neupert had changed 
to Mr. Charles E. Neupert and 
there was another interesting 
inked addition. The printed pam- 
phlet said that all this had been 
“discovered by Charles E. Neu- 
pert.” This was revised to read: 
“Discovered by Prof. U. G. Mor- 
row, Chicago 1897, developed by 
Charles E. Neupert.” Presumably 
because I had never heard of Pro- 
fessor U. G. Morrow, there was 
still no sale. 

The episode came to mind 
again a few weeks ago, when I re- 
ceived a letter from an Air Force 
officer who wanted to know 
whether it was really true that 
somebody once said that the 
Earth was hollow, with an inter- 
nal sun as well as an external sun, 
and that there was a hole near the 
pole large enough to fly an air- 
plane inside. 

The answer to the query is that 
somebody had actually said so, 
except that he wanted to sail “in- 
side” with a ship and carry the 
airplanes for exploration of the 
Inner World — at the time, air- 
planes did not have ranges of 
more than a few hundred miles. 
Actually the man who said so, a 




Th* hollow Earth oi imoginod by Sir 
John Leilio. 

Mr. Marshall B. Gardner, was 
only the last of a long but some- 
what disconnected line of hollow 
Earth advocates. 

In fact, the concept began with 
two men of science who are still 
known to science as pioneers in 
many fields. One was the Scottish 
mathematician and physicist Sir 
John Leslie, who lived from 1766 
to 1832 and who wrote on “Nat- 
ural Philosophy” and worked out 
experiments to explore “the Na- 
ture and Properties of Heat.” 

The other man, who lived just 
about one century earlier, is even 
more famous. He was Dr. Ed- 
mond Halley, the first man to 
predict the return of the comet 
named after him, and also the first 
to state in so many words that 
the Earth’s atmosphere must have 
an upper limit. Eklmond Halley 
must have formed his idea about 
the internal constitution of the 
Earth at about the time he be-

came editor of the Philosophical 
Transactions of the Royal Society 
(in 1685); his own paper ap- 
peared in the Transactions in 
1692. 

A MONG the many things 
which interested Halley were 
the vagaries of the Earth’s mag- 
netic field. If you put all the re- 
ports together — and Halley ex- 
celled in assembling reports from 
all sources and drawing conclu- 
sions from them — it seemed as if 
the Earth’s magnetic p>oles did not 
stay put in one place. Trying to 
explain this strange behavior, 
Halley produced charts of the de- 
viations of the compass needle 
and then said that these devia- 
tions might well be based on the 
internal structure of the Earth. 

If the Earth consisted of three 
concentric shells, the observed 
facts might be explained by as- 
suming that the three shells ro- 
tated with minute differences in 
speed. It was probably only a 
matter of seconds, or even frac- 
tions of a second, per day, but 
these differences caused the ob- 
served “misreadings” of the com- 
pass needle. 

Since the innermost shell of 
the three was still a hollow shell, 
one had to assume an empty 
space at the center, but Halley 
did not want to believe that it 
was completely empty. So he pos- 
tulated that at the center of the

whole there was a sphere of glow- 
ing hot matter, a kind of minia- 
ture sun. Nobody would ever be 
able to see it because the three 
shells were unbroken and hun- 
dreds of miles in thickness. 

As far as one can tell, Halley’s 
contemporaries were not very 
much impressed with the whole 
idea, though they welcomed the 
chart of the magnetic deviations. 
The matter more or less lapsed 
in the course of the ensuing dec- 
ades and finally was not remem- 
bered any more by anybody but 
a few historians of science. 

At much later dates, Halley’s 
concept often came to be men- 
tioned in the same breath with 
Sir John Leslie’s, as if they were 
alike, or as if Leslie had simply 
revived Halley’s ideas some three- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



quarters of a century later. Actu- 
ally there was a fundamental dif- 
ference. 

Halley had supposed three con- 
centric spheres. Leslie simply 
thought that the Earth was hol- 
low, a thick-shelled bubble, as it 
were. But he also thought that 
the hollow Earth could not be 
completely empty inside and he 
also supposed an internal minia- 
ture sun — or, rather, two of them. 
The two glowing bodies were sup- 
posed to move around each other 
as the binary stars far out in space 
do— the motion of the binaries 
had just been discovered and re- 
ported by Sir William Herschel. 

Sir John Leslie even gave 
names to his two internal suns; 
classical mythology provided two 
that did fit well under the as-

last proposal of its kind. 



sumed circumstances: Pluto and 
Proserpina. 

A THIRD hollow Earth theo- 
rizer of about the same period 
was the founder of the calculus 
of variations and inventor of the 
binary logarithms, the Swiss 
mathematician and physicist 
Leonhard Euler. Euler, for whose 
services there was a heated com- 
petition between Frederick the 
Great of Prussia and Catherine 
the Great of Russia— both wanted 
him for their respective newly 
founded Academies of Sciences 
and both got him, first Catherine, 
then Frederick and then Cath- 
erine again— held a concept which 
really can be lumped with Les- 
lie’s. The only difference was that 
Euler supposed only one internal 
sun in the center, just as Halley 
had done. 

Some thirty years after Euler’s 
death — Leslie was still alive — 
the idea of a hollow Earth erupt- 
ed with a great deal of noise and 
really became piopular for a few 
decades, at least in America. 

What happened and how it 
happiened is comparatively easy 
to find out, but to say how the 
new prophet of an old idea, John 
Cleves Symmes, fitted into the 
sequence of hollow Earth theo- 
rizers is considerably more diffi- 
cult. 

He claimed repeatedly that his 
“theory” originated with him and

75 



that he had the first flash of it 
one night when he looked at Jupi- 
ter. But on one occasion, when 
asked point blank whether he 
acknowledged the priority of 
Euler and Halley, he admitted 
that he knew of their ideas, but 
brushed the question aside by 
saying that they had taught some- 
thing entirely different. 

Actually, Symmes’ ideas were 
just a modification of Halley’s. 
Instead of three concentric 
spheres, Symmes had five. There 
was no central sim. And all five 
shells had large holes near their 
poles and each shell rotated at a 
different speed. 

There is a rather tenuous liter- 
ary thread connecting Halley and 
Symmes. The uncle of the theorist 
Captain John Cleves Symmes (he 
had held an Army commission 
and had fought with distinction 
in two engagements of the war 
of 1812) was a then well-known 
judge who once wrote his nephew 
as follows: 

“In the reign of James VI of 
Scotland, who was the same per- 
son with James I of England, 
about the year 1620, a Protestant 
dissenting clergyman by the name 
of Symmes came over from Eng- 
land with a company of pious 
adventurers . Mr. Symmes af- 
terward went from Plymouth with 
a part of the first settlers and 
built Charlestown, where he pre- 
sided as pastor over a Presby- 

76 



terian congregation. .” 

The Symmes family, then, 
reached America in the form of 
a Protestant clergyman, and Cap- 
tain Symmes once said that there 
had been a number of clergymen 
in his family. One may safely pre- 
sume that they owned religious 
books; one such book. The Chris- 
tian Philosopher by the famous 
Cotton Mather, contained an ap- 
proving description of Halley’s 
concept. 

I am willing to concede that 
Symmes might have forgotten 
what he read as a boy, but Hal- 
ley’s idea must have stuck in his 
mind somehow, for their concepts 
are too similar to be pure acci- 
dent. 

I^ROM one pointy of view, 
Symmeswas perfectly justified 
in dismissing Halley and Euler as 
predecessors. With them, the con- 
cept of a hollow Earth had been 
one theory among many others, 
and if confronted with proof to 
the contrary, they would proba- 
bly have discarded it with small 
regrets. To Symmes, it was not 
a theory, even though he used 
this word: it was a credo, an 
overwhelming obsession which he 
would have been unable to shed 
even if somebody could have 
bundled him into an airplane and 
flown him to the poles. In the 
succession of hollow Earth theo- 
rizers, Symmes was the first crank. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



His entrance on the public 
scene was peculiar enough. He 
mailed out five hundred printed 
letters, to all members of Con- 
gress, the presidents of universi- 
ties and learned societies in the 
United States, and to a number 
of learned men in Europe. At- 
tached to the letter were: (A) a 
printed “postscript” on a separate 
sheet and (B) a certificate of 
sanity! I have not been able to 
ascertain the wording of that cer- 
tificate, but the letter and the 
postscript read as follows: 

St. Louis, Missouri Territory 
North America 
April 10, A.D. 1818 
To All the World: 

I declare the earth is hollow and 
habitable within; containing a num- 
ber of solid, concentrick spheres; one 
within the other, and it is open at 
the poles twelve or sixteen degrees. 
I pledge my life in support of this 
truth, and am ready to explore the 
hollow, if the World will support and 
aid me in the undertaking.

Of Ohio, late Captain of Infantry 
P.S. I have ready for the press a 
treatise on the principles of matter, 
wherein I show proof of the above 
positions, account for various pheno- 
mena, and disclose Dr. Darwin’s 
“Golden Secret.” 

My terms are the patronage of

I dedicate to my wife and her ten

I select Dr. S. L. Mitchell, Sir H.

I ask one hundred brave compan- 
ions, well equipped, to start from 
Siberia, in the fall season, with 
reindeer and sleighs, on the ice of 
the frozen sea; I engage we find a 



warm and rich land, stocked with 
thrifty vegetables and animals, if not 
men, on reaching one degree north- 
ward of latitude 82; we will return 
in the succeeding spring.

T T GOES without saying that 
Dr. Mitchell, Sir Humphrey 
Davy and the Baron von Hum- 
boldt had no idea of the honor 
conferred upon them, unless they, 
as is likely, were on the mailing 
list for the letter and learned 
about it after the event. It also 
goes without saying that the prom- 
ised treatise never appeared, so 
that the world still does not 
know what Dr. Erasmus Darwin’s 
(grandfather of the famous natu- 
ralist) Golden Secret was sup- 
posed to have been. 

In fact, Symmes never wrote 
a book about his own theory. One 
pamphlet about it was written by 
a disciple during Symmes’ life- 
time and Symmes himself said 
that he had not been proj>erly 
presented. Another pamphlet was 
written after his death by his son 
Americus Vespuccius Symmes 
and, of course, we can’t tell what 
his father would have said about 
it. What Symmes did write were 
a few Memoirs in succession, but 
they, too, were mere one-page 
statements, if that is the word to 
use. 

To let my readers decide for 
themselves which word should or 
might be used. I’ll quote Memoir 
No. II in full:

With dividers describe a circle on 
a plane of matter of loose texture, 
and in the centre add a very small 
circle; then draw a line through the 
centre. It is evident (as matter gravi- 
tates matter in proportion to quan- 
tity and distance) that either half 
of the inner circle, being almost 
equal surrounded by matter, must be 
a very little gravitated centrewise; 
so being suspended, only a rotary 
motion is needed to throw it com- 
pactly toward the outer circle. This 
being admitted, it follows that half- 
way from the outer to the inner side 
of this circle of matter so thrown 
out, a like rarity, suspension, or ba- 
lance of gravity should prevail, and 
hence a disposition to concentric 
circles; therefore it follows that suc- 
cessive similar subdivisions should 
exist, gradually lessening in force or 
quantity. By applying this principle 
to the earth, I found the necessity 
of hollow concentric spheres. A de- 
cision of schoolmen on these lines 
should be followed by additional po- 
sitions, further explaining my new 
principles of hollow spheres, open 
at the poles, declared in a circular 
letter of the 10th of April, 1818. 

John Cleves Symmes, 
of Ohio, late Captain of Infantry 

The French Academy, after 
reading the communications and 
presumably after making certain 
that their difficulties were not 
merely linguistic, produced some 
choice expressions of ridicule. 
Symmes was deeply hurt, because 
he apparently had been convinced 
that one of the members of the 
Academy would applaud him. 

This member was Pierre Simon, 
the Marquis de Laplace. The rea- 
son: Laplace had published his 
own ideas about the poles. Con- 
densed, they amounted to about 

78 



this: The Earth has an equatorial 
bulge, caused by its rotation. The 
formation of the equatorial bulge 
may well have been accompanied 
by the formation of polar depres- 
sions, so that explorers, once they 
got that far, should find warm and 
ice-free polar seas, warmed by the 
internal heat of the Earth. 

' I ' O Symmes’ mind, this had 
been a step in the right direc- 
tion and he felt that Laplace had 
just not gone far enough. Since 
Symmes had gone further, La- 
place was supposed to applaud — 
but Laplace did not want to go 
any further. 

Because Symmes’ teachings 
have to be reconstructed from 
endless interviews he gave to 
newspaper reporters, from reports 
about his many lectures and from 
letters he wrote to the editors, 
there is no way of arriving at a 
definite picture. The figures he 
gave were not always the same 
and crucial points often are not 
mentioned. 

At any event, the outermost 
Earth shell had a thickness of 
about 1000 miles. The circular 
opening — popularly called 
“Symmes Hole” — in the north 
had a diameter of about 2000 
miles; the one in the south was 
somewhat larger. The rims of 
these openings — Symmes called 
them “verges” — were open seas, 
beyond the “icy hoops” that had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been insufficiently penetrated by 
explorers and whalers. 

While the verges were perfect- 
ly circular, they were not cen- 
tered on the poles. The axis of 
rotation formed an angle of be- 
tween 12 and 14 degrees with the 
center line of the verges. What 
the relative positions of axis of 
rotation and of the verges of the 
inner shells were supposed to be 
was not made clear. Symmes’ son 
later assumed that all verges 
were lined up along the same cen- 
ter line. 

All these shells were “habitable 
without and within upon my word 
of honor” and, in addition to all 
this surface space, there was more 
room by far because in the stony 
shell were numerous and enor- 
mous caves with a native life of 
their own. This assertion was 
made mostly about the outermost 
shell. I don’t know whether there 
were big caves in the inner shells, 
too. 

As for the southern verge, some 
ships must have come close to it, 
for their captains and crews had 
seen the light reflected from the 
icy hoop across the verge. They 
had called them the Magellanic 
Clouds. In the north, the verge 
was highest in latitude to the 
north of Europe, but the Svalbard 
Archipelago was close to it. Its 
northermost island, now called 
Northeast Land, might possibly 
be in the verge. This position 



necessitated that the verge ate a 
considerable chunk out of north- 
ern Siberia, which was practically 
unknown at the time. 

Symmes, while conducting his 
lecture tours like a political cam- 
paign, petitioned Congress twice 
for an expedition to the verge, 
starting off from the West Coast 
and working its way up to Siberia. 
Congress managed to bury both 
petitions — their dates were 1822 
and 1823 — by means of tricks 
with which Congressmen have a 
lot of experience. 

The French Academy stood 
firm. 

But the Russians actually nib- 
bled at the bait. 

S ymmes claimed to have re- 
ceived a personal letter from 
the Czar, which is unlikely, but 
there was correspondence with 
the Czar’s representatives. The 
Russians, remember, owned all of 
Siberia and Alaska, but very little 
was known about this territory 
It was considered an accomplish- 
ment to know that there was no 
land bridge between Siberia and 
Alaska. 

The Czar’s government had 
been toying with the idea of a 
more thorough exploration of Si- 
beria all along. If this explora- 
tion might open a gateway to the 
Inner World, they were ready — 
or at least willing — to find out 
and annex what could be found.

Symmes was invited to come 
to Russia and assist in organizing 
the expedition. It was taken for 
granted that he would go along 
as one of the leaders, in 1827. He 
declined because of poor health. 
Two years later, on May 29, 1829, 
he died at the age of not quite 
49 years. 

Although the newspapers had 
been quite excited about his 
theory and the public had flocked 
to his lectures, Symmes apparent- 
ly had had mainly nothing more 
than curiosity value even to his 
admirers. Soon after his death, it 
was all over. A few major articles 
in magazines — Harper’s for ex- 
ample — appeared later, but were 
considered “historical articles” by 
the readers. They did not influ- 
ence anybody. 

However, hollow Earth ideas, 
now solidly in the hands of cranks, 
still persisted. During the latter 
part of the nineteenth century, 
one Cyrus Reed Teed, writing 
mostly under the name of Koresh, 
was the first to anticipate Herr 
Neupert. Teed also said that we 
live on the inside of the Earth, 
but he was far less definite about 
astronomical facts to be explained 
away than Neupert at a later 
date. 

In 1868, one W. F. Lyons, who 
called himself Professor, pub- 
lished a book with the title A 
Hollow Globe, which was simply 
a copy of Symmes, who, however, 

80 



was not even mentioned. “Profes- 
sor” Lyons, if somebody ques- 
tioned him about that oversight, 
probably replied that his theory 
was entirely different — he did 
not have any additional hollow 
spheres inside the Earth. 

¥ N fiction, the hollow Earth 
* idea has been given a quite 
thorough workout. The earliest, 
written during Symmes’ lifetime, 
was a satirical treatment called 
The Journal of Capt. Adam Sea- 
born : Symzonia, published in 

1822. As you’ll notice, Symmes’ 
name is worked into the title. 

But from that point on, though 
the number of books increases 
considerably, he gets less mention. 
For example, Poe’s The Narrative 
of Arthur Gordon Pym (about 
1850) merely is similar to the 
good captain’s name. 

Then comes Verne’s The Voy- 
age to the Center of the Earth 
(1864). In 1892, William R. 
Bradshaw’s The Goddess of At- 
vatabar/Beini the History of the 
Discovery of the Interior l¥orld 
created a bit of a stir. 

Science fiction readers are most 
familiar, of course, with the Pellu- 
cidar series of Edgar Rice Bur- 
roughs, which began in 1922 with 
At the Earth’s Core. 

Those are the outstanding 
items. There have been others and 
undoubtedly there will be more, 
even though the concept has been 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



so wholly exploded. Ideas die 
hard, you know, and false ones 
often appear to be especially en- 
during. 

The Marshall B. Gardner who 
was mentioned earlier in the ar- 
ticle was really the latest and pre- 
sumably last of the proponents of 
a hollow Earth of what might be 
called the “classical” type. In 
1914, he published a small vol- 
ume with the title A Journey to 
the Earth’s Interior, Or, Have the 
Poles Really Been Discovered? 
His model of the hollow Earth 
was almost precisely that of Euler, 
a thick shell with a miniature svin 
in the center, but with two verges 
concentric to the poles added. 

Gardner’s argument was that 
there was still some doubt that 
anybody had actually reached the 
poles and that the explorers them- 
selves would be bound to be 
confused, since they did not ex- 
pect to find themselves in a verge. 
The aurora was explained by 



Gardner as the reflection of the 
light from the inner sun, shining 
through the verge, on the outer 
atmosphere. 

A second and much enlarged 
edition of the book appeared in 
1920. Gardner rejected with utter 
indignation any comparison be- 
tween his idea and “Symmes’ non- 
sense.” Reading his book is a 
strange experience; it is full of 
the most obvious flaws in logic 
and the most amateurish misin- 
terpretation of scientific facts 
taken from books of popular sci- 
ence. Coupled with this is an ob- 
vious desire for absolute honesty 
— in pursuit of falsity. 

Well, the poles now are dis- 
covered and at least one airline 
is flying commercially over the 
area where Laplace expected a 
large depression and a warm sea 
and where others dreamed of ver- 
ges opening a pathway to a fabu- 
lous inner world.

All Ronnie wanted was to go 
back to his beautiful valley 
— but where on Earth was it? 



Little 

Red 

Schoolhouse 



By ROBERT F. YOUNG 



R onnie avoided the 
towns. Whenever he 
came to one, he made a 
wide detour, coming back to the 
tracks miles beyond it. He knew 
that none of the towns was the 
village he was looking for. The 
towns were bright and new, with 
white streets and brisk cars and 
big factories, while the village in 
the valley was old and quiet, with 
rustic houses and shaded streets 
and a little red schoolhouse. 

Just before you came to the 
village, there was a grove of 
friendly maples with a brook 



winding through them. Ronnie re- 
membered the brook best of all. 
In summer, he had waded in it 
many times, and he had skated 
on it in winter; in autumn, he had 
watched the fallen leaves, like 
Lilliputian ships, sail down it to 
the sea. 

Ronnie had been sure that he 
could find the valley, but the 
tracks went on and on, through 
fields and hills and forests, and no

while, he began to wonder if he 
had chosen the right tracks, if the 
shining rails he followed day af-

ter day were really the rails along 
which the stork train had borne 
him to the city and to his parents. 

He kept telling himself that he 
wasn’t truly running away from 
home, that the aseptic three-room 
apartment in which he had lived 
for a month wasn’t his home at 
all, any more than the pallid man 
and woman v/ho had met him at 
the bustling terminal were his 
mother and father. 

His real home was in the val- 
ley, in the old rambling house at 
the outskirts of the village; and 
his real parents were Nora and 
Jim, who had cared for him 
throughout his boyhood. True, 
they had never claimed to be his 
parents, but they were just the 
same, even if they put him on the 
stork train when he was asleep 
and sent him to the city to live 
with the pallid people who pre- 
tended to be his parents. 

Nights, when the shadows came 
too close around his campfire, he 
thought of Nora and Jim and the 
village. But most of all, he thought 
of Miss Smith, the teacher in the 
little red schoolhouse. Thinking 
of Miss Smith made him brave 
and he lay back in the summer 
grass beneath the summer stars 
and he wasn’t scared at all. 

N THE , fourth morning, he 

ate the last of the condensed 
food tablets he had stolen from 
his parents’ apartment. He knew 

LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE 



that he had to find the valley 
soon and he walked faster along 
the tracks, staring eagerly ahead 
for the first familiar landmark — 
a remembered tree or a nostalgic 
hilltop, the silvery twinkle of a 
winding brook. The trip on the 
stork train had been his first trip 
into the outside world, so he was 
not certain how the valley would 
look, coming into it from the sur- 
rounding coimtryside; neverthe- 
less, he was sure he would recog- 
nize it quickly. 

His legs were stronger now 
than they had been when he had 
first steppied off the stork train 
and his dizzy spells were becom- 
ing less and less frequent. The 
Sim no longer bothered his eyes 
and he could look for long mo- 
ments at the blue sky and the 
bright land with no painful after- 
images. 

Toward evening, he heard a 
high-pitched whistle and his heart 
began to pound. He knew at last 
that he had the right tracks and 
that he couldn’t be very far from 
the valley, for the whistle was the 
shrill lullaby of a stork train. 

Ronnie hid in the weeds that 
lined the embankment and 
watched the train pass. He saw 
the children reclining on their 
chairbeds, staring curiously 
through the little windows, and 
he remembered how he had 
stared, too, on his trip to the city, 
how surprised — and frightened — 

83 



he had been, upon awakening, to 
see the strange new land unroll- 
ing before his aching eyes. 

He wondered if his face had 
been as white as those he was see- 
ing now, as white and as peaked 
and as sickly, and he guessed that* 
probably it had been, that living 
in the valley affected your com- 
plexion some way, made your 
eyes sensitive to light and your 
legs weak. 

But that couldn’t be the an- 
swer. His legs had never been 
weak when he had lived in the 
valley, he remembered, and his 
eyes had never bothered him. 
He’d never had trouble seeing the 
lessons on the blackboard in the 
little red schoolhouse and he’d 
read all the printed words in the 
schoolbooks without the slightest 
difficulty. In fact, he’d done so 
well with his reading lessons that 
Miss Smith had patted him on 
the back, more times than he 
could remember, and told him 
that he was her star pupil. 

SUDDENLY he realized how 
^ eager he was to see Miss 
Smith again, to walk into the lit- 
tle classroom and have her say, 
“Good morning, Ronnie,” and see 
her sitting reassuringly behind 
her desk, her yellow hair parted 
neatly in the middle and her 
round cheeks pink in the morn- 
ing light. For the first time, it oc- 
curred to him that he was in 



love with Miss Smith and he rec- 
ognized his real reason for re- 
turning to the valley. 

The other reasons were still 
valid, though. He wanted to wade 
in the brook again, and feel the 
cool tree shadows all around him, 
and after that he wanted to me- 
ander through the maples, pick- 
ing a slow way homeward, and 
finally he wanted to wander down 
the lazy village street to the house 
and have Nora scold him for be- 
ing late for supper. 

The stork train was still pass- 
ing. Ronnie couldn’t get over how 
long it was. Where did all the 
children come from? He didn’t 
recognize a single one of them, 
yet he had lived in the valley all 
his life. He hadn’t recognized any 
of the children on his own stork 
train, either, for that matter. He 
shook his head. The whole thing 
was bewildering, far beyond his 
understanding. 

When the last of the cars had 
passed, he climbed back up the 
embankment to the tracks. Dusk 
was seeping in over the land and 
soon, he knew, the first star would 
appear. If only he could find the 
valley before night came! He 
wouldn’t even pause to wade in 
the brook; he would run through 
the maples and down the street 
to the house. Nora and Jim would 
be delighted to see him again and 
Nora would fix a fine supper; and 
perhaps Miss Smith would come 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



over during the evening, as she 
sometimes did, and discuss his 
schoolwork, and he would walk 
to the gate with her, when she 
was ready to go, and say good 
night, and see the starlight on her 
face as she stood goddess-tall be- 
side him . 

He hurried along the tracks, 
staring hungrily ahead for some 
sign of the valley. The shadows 
deepened around him and the 
damp breath of night crept down 
from the hills. Insects awoke in 
the tall meadow grass, katydids 
and crickets, and frogs began sing- 
ing in ponds. 

After a while, the first star 
came out. 

¥T E WAS surprised when he 
came to the big broad-shoul- 
dered building. He did not recall 
having seen it during his ride on 
the stork train. That was odd, be- 
cause he had never left the win- 
dow once during the whole trip. 

He paused on the tracks, gaz- 
ing at the towering brick facade 
with its tiers and tiers of small 
barred windows. Most of the up- 
p>er windows were dark, but all 
of the first-floor windows were 
ablaze with light. The first-floor 
windows were different in other 
respects, too, he noticed. There 
were no bars on them and they 
were much larger than the higher 
ones. Ronnie wondered why that 
should be. 

LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE 



And then he noticed something 
else. The tracks stretched right up 
to the imposing facade and en- 
tered the building through a lofty 
archway. Ronnie gasped. The 
building must be a terminal, like 
the one in the city, where his par- 
ents had met him. But why hadn’t 
he seen it when the stork train 
had passed through it? 

Then he remembered that he’d 
been put on the train when he was 
asleep and could have missed the 
first part of the journey. He’d as- 
sumed, when he awoke, that the 
train was just pulling out of the 
valley, but perhaps it had pulled 
out some time before — a long 
time, even — and had passed 
through the terminal while he was 
sleeping. 

It was a logical explanation, 
but Ronnie was reluctant to ac- 
cept it. If it was true, then the 
valley was still a long way off, 
and he wanted the valley to be 
close, close enough for him to 
reach it tonight. He was so hun- 
gry, he could hardly stand it, and 
he was terribly tired. 

He looked miserably at the big 
hulking building, wondering what 
to do. 

“Hello, Ronnie.” 

Ronnie almost collapsed with 
fright on the tracks. He peered 
around him into the shadows. At 
first he saw no one, but after a 
while he made out the figure of a 
tall man in a gray uniform stand- 



85 



ing in a grove of locusts border- 
ing the tracks. The man’s uniform 
matched the shadows and Ronnie 
realized with a start that he had 
been standing there all along. 

“You are Ronnie Meadows, 
aren’t you?” 

“Yes — yes, sir,” Ronnie said. 
He wanted to turn and run, but 
he knew it wouldn’t do any good. 
He was so tired and weak that the 
tall man could catch him easily. 

“I’ve been waiting for you, 
Ronnie,” the tall man said, a note 
of warmth in his voice. He left 
the tree shadows and walked over 
to the tracks. “I‘ve been worried 
about you.” 

“Worried?” 

“Why, of course. Worrying 
about boys who leave the valley 
is my job. You see, I’m the truant 
officer.” 

"DONNIE’S eyes got big. “Oh, 
but I didn’t want to leave the 
valley, sir,” he said. “Nora and 
Jim waited until I went to sleep 
one night, and then they put me 
on the stork train, and when I 
woke up, I was already on my 
way to the city. I want to go back 
to the valley, sir. I — I ran away 
from home.” 

“I understand,” the truant offi- 
cer said, “and I’m going to take 
you back to the valley — back to 
the little red schoolhouse.” He 
reached down and took Ronnie’s 
hand. 

LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE 



“Oh, will you, sir?” Ronnie 
could hardly contain the sudden 
happiness that coursed through 
him. “I want to go back in the 
worst way!” 

“Of course I will. It’s my job.” 
The truant officer started walking 
toward the big building and Ron- 
nie hurried along beside him. “But 
first I’ve got to take you to the 
principal.” 

Ronnie drew back. He became 
aware then of what a tight grip 
the truant officer had on his weak- 
feeling hand. 

“Come on,” the truant officer 
said, making the grip even tighter, 
“The principal won’t hurt you.” 
“I — I never knew there was a 
principal,” Ronnie said, hanging 
back. “Miss Smith never said any- 
thing about him.” 

“Naturally there’s a principal; 
there has to be. And he wants to 
talk to you before you go back. 
Come on now, like a good boy, 
and' don’t make it necessary for 
me to turn in a bad report about 
you. Miss Smith wouldn’t like 
that at all, would she?” 

“No, I guess she wouldn’t,” 
Ronnie said, suddenly contrite. 
“All right, sir. I’ll go.” 

Ronnie had learned about prin- 
cipals in school, but he had never 
seen one. He had always assumed 
that the little red schoolhouse 
was too small to need one and 
he still couldn’t imderstand why 
it should. Miss Smith was per- 

87 



fectly capable of conducting the 
school all by herself. But most of 
all, he couldn’t understand why 
the principal should live in a 
place like the terminal — if it was 
a terminal — and not in the val- 
ley. 

However, he accompanied the 
truant officer dutifully, telling 
himself that he had a great deal 
to learn about the world and that 
an interview with a principal was 
bound to teach him a lot. 

^ I HEY entered the building 
through an entrance to the 
left of the archway and walked 
down a long bright corridor lined 
with all green cabinets to a 
frosted glass door at the farther 
end. The lettering on the glass 
said: EDUCATIONAL CEN- 

TER 16, H. D. CURTIN, PRIN- 
CIPAL. 

The door opened at the truant 
officer’s touch and they stepped 
into a small white-walled room 
even more brightly illumined 
than the corridor. Opposite the 
door was a desk with a girl sitting 
behind it, and behind the girl was 
another frosted glass door. The 
lettering said: PRIVATE. 

The girl looked up as the tru- 
ant officer and Ronnie entered. 
She was young and pretty — al- 
most as pretty as Miss Smith. 

“Tell the old man the Meadows 
kid finally showed up,” the truant 
officer said. 

88 



The girl’s eyes touched Ron- 
nie’s, then dropped quickly to a 
little box on her desk. Ronnie felt 
funny. There had been a strange 
look in the girl’s eyes — a sort of 
sadness. It was as though she was 
sorry that the truant officer had 
found him. 

She told the little box: “Mr. 
Curtin, Andrews just brought in 
Ronnie Meadows.” 

“Good,” the box said. “Send 
the boy in and notify his parents.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The principal’s office was un- 
like anything Ronnie had ever 
seen before. Its hugeness made 
him uncomfortable and the 
brightness of its fluorescent lights 
hurt his eyes. All the lights 
seemed to be shining right in his 
face and he could hardly see the 
man behind the desk. 

But he could see him well 
enough to make out some of his 
features: the high white forehead 
and receding hairline, the thin 
cheeks, the almost lipless mouth. 

For some reason, the man’s face 
frightened Ronnie and he wished 
that the interview were over. 

“I have only a few questions to 
ask you,” the principal said, “and 
then you can be on your way 
back to the valley.” 

“Yes, sir,” Ronnie said, some 
of his fear leaving him. 

“Were your mother and father 
unkind to you? Your real mother 
and father, I mean.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“No, sir. They were very good 
to me. I’m sorry I had to run 
away from them, but I just had to 
go back to the valley.” 

“Were you lonesome for Nora 
and Jim?” 

Ronnie wondered how the prin- 
cipal knew their names. “Yes, 
sir.” 

“And Miss Smith — were you 
lonesome for her?” 

“Oh, yes, sir!” 

T¥E FELT the principal’s eyes 
upon him and he shifted un- 
comfortably. He was so tired, he 
wished the principal would ask 
him to sit down. But the principal 
didn’t and the lights seemed to 
get brighter and brighter. 

“Are you in love with Miss 
Smith?” 

The question startled Ronnie, 
not so much because he hadn’t 
expected it, but because of the 
tone in which it was uttered. 
There was unmistakable loathing 
in the principal’s voice. Ronnie 
felt his neck grow hot, and then 
his face, and he was too ashamed 
to meet the principal’s eyes, no 
matter how hard he tried. But the 
strange part of it was, he didn’t 
understand why he was ashamed. 

The question came again, the 
loathing more pronounced than 
before: “Are you in love with 
Miss Smith?” 

“Yes, sir,” Ronnie said. 

Silence came and sat in the 



room. Ronnie kept his eyes down, 
fearfully awaiting the next ques- 
tion. 

But there were no more 
questions and presently he be- 
came aware that the door behind 
him had opened and that the tru- 
ant officer was standing over him. 
He heard the principal’s voice: 
“Level Six. Tell the tech on duty 
to try Variant 24-C on him.” 
“Yes, sir,” the truant officer 
said. He took Ronnie’s hand. 
“Come on, Ronnie.” 

“Where’re we going?” 

“Why, back to the valley, of 
course. Back to the little red 
schoolhouse.” 

Ronnie followed the truant offi- 
cer out of the office, his heart 
singing. It seemed almost too 
easy, almost too good to be true. 

Ronnie didn’t understand why 
they had to take the elevator to 
get to the valley. But perhaps 
they were going to the roof of the 
building and board a ’copter, so 
he didn’t say anything till the 
elevator stopped on the sixth floor 
and they stepped out into a long, 
long corridor lined with hundreds 
of horizontal doors so close to- 
gether that they almost seemed 
to touch. 

Then he said: “But this isn’t 
the way to the valley, sir. Where 
are you taking me?” 

“Back to school,” the truant 
officer said, the warmth gone from 
his voice. “Come along now!” 



LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE 



89 



130NNIE tried to hold back, 
but it wasn’t any use. The 
truant officer was big and strong 
and he dragged Ronnie down the 
long antiseptic corridor to a re- 
cess in which a gaunt woman in a 
white uniform was sitting behind 
a metal desk. 

“Here’s the Meadows kid,” he 
said. “The old man says to change 
the plot to 24-C.” 

The gaunt woman got up wear- 
ily. Ronnie was crying by then 
and she selected an ampoule from 
a glass cabinet beside the desk, 
came over and rolled up his 
sleeve and, despite his squirming, 
expertly jabbed the needle into 
his arm. 

“Save your tears till later,” she 
said. “You’ll need them.” She 
turned to the truant officer. “Cur- 
tin’s guilt complex must be get- 
ting the best of him. This is the 
third 24-C he’s prescribed this 
month.” 

“The old man knows what he’s 
doing.” 

“He only thinks he knows what 
he’s doing. First thing you know, 
we’ll have a whole world full of 
Curtins. It’s about time someone 
on the Board of Education took a 
course in psychology and found 
out what mother- love is all 
about!” 

“The old man’s a graduate psy- 
chologist,” the truant officer said. 

“You mean a graduate psycho- 
path!” 



“You shouldn’t talk like that.” 
“I’ll talk the way I please,” the 
gaunt woman said. “You don’t 
hear them crying, but I do. C-24 
belongs back in the twentieth cen- 
tuty and should have been thrown 
out of the curriculum long ago!” 
She took Ronnie’s arm and led 
him away. The truant officer 
shrugged and returned to the ele- 
vator. Ronnie heard the metal 
doors breathe shut. The corridor 
was very quiet and he followed 
the woman as though in a dream. 
He could hardly feel his arms and 
legs, and his brain had grown 
fuzzy. 

The gaunt woman turned off 
into another corridor and then 
into another. Finally they came 
to an open door. The woman 
stopped before it. 

“Recognize the old home- 
stead?” she asked bitterly. 

But Ronnie hardly heard her. 
He could barely keep his eyes 
open. There was a bed in the 
shelflike cubicle beyond the hori- 
zontal door, a strange bed with all 
sorts of wires and dials and 
screens and tubes around it. But 
it was a bed, and for the moment 
that was all he cared about, and 
he climbed upon it gratefully. He 
lay his head back on the pillow 
and closed his eyes. 

“That’s a good boy,” he heard 
the woman say just before he 
dropped off. “And now back to 
the little red schoolhouse.” 



90

pillow purred and the 
screens lit up and the tapes 
went into action. 

“Ronnie!” 

Ronnie stirred beneath the 
covers, fighting the dream. It had 
been a horrible dream, filled with 
stork trains and strange people 
and unfamiliar places. And the 
worst part of it was, it could be 
true. Nora had told him many 
times that some morning, when 
he awoke, he would be on the 
stork train, bound for the city and 
his parents. 

He fought harder and harder, 
kicking at the covers and trying 
to open his eyes. 

“Ronnie,” Nora called again. 
“Hurry up or you’ll be late for 
school!” 

His eyes opened then, of their 
own accord, and instantly he 
knew that everything was all 
right. There was the bright morn- 
ing sunlight streaming into his at- 
tic bedroom, and there were the 
nostalgic branches of the back- 
yard maple gently brushing his 
window. 

“Coming!” He threw back the 
covers and leaped out of bed and 
dressed, standing in a warm pud- 
dle, of sunlight. Then he washed 
and ran downstairs. 

“It’‘s about time,” Nora said 
sharply when he came into the 
kitchen. “You’re getting lazier and 
lazier every day!” 

Ronnie stared at her. She must 

LITTLE RED SCHUOLHOUSE 



be feeling ill, he thought. She had 
never spoken to him like that be- 
fore. Then Jim came in. He hadn’t 
shaved and his eyes were blood- 
shot. 

“For Pete’s sake,” he said, “isn’t 
breakfast ready yet?” 

“In a minute, in a minute,” 
Nora snapped back. “I’ve been 
trying to get this lazy brat out of 
bed for the last half hour.” 

Bewildered, Ronnie sat down 
at the table. He ate in silence, 
wondering what could have hapi- 
pened in the brief span of a sin- 
gle night to change Nora and Jim 
so. Breakfast was pancakes and 
sausage, his favorite dish, but the 
pancakes were soggy and the sau- 
sage was half raw. 

He excused himself after his 
second pancake and went into the 
living room and got his books. 
The living room was untidy and 
had a moldy smell. When he left 
the house, Jim and Nora were 
arguing loudly in the kitchen. 

Ronnie frowned. What had hap- 
pened? He was sure that things 
hadn’t been this way yesterday. 
Nora had been kind then, Jim 
soft-spoken and immaculate, and 
the house neat. 

What had changed everything? 

tTE SHRUGGED. In a mo- 
ment, he would be in school 
and see Miss Smith’s smiling face 
and everything would be all right 
again. He hurried down the bright 



91 



street, past the rustic houses, and 
the laughing children on their 
way to school. Miss Smith, his 
heart sang. Beautiful Miss Smith. 

The Sun was in her hair when 
he walked in the door and the lit- 
tle bun at the back of her neck 
was like a golden pomegranate. 
Her cheeks were like roses after 
a morning shower and her voice 
was a soft summer wind. 

“Good morning, Ronnie,” she 
said. 

“Good morning. Miss Smith.” 
He walked on clouds to his seat. 

The lessons began — arithmetic, 
spelling, social studies, reading. 
Ronnie wasn’t called upon to re- 
cite till reading class, when Miss 
Smith told him to read aloud 
from the little red primary reader. 

He stood up proudly. The story 
was about Achilles and Hector. 
Ronnie got the first sentence off 
fine. He didn’t begin to stumble 
till the middle of the second. The 
words seemed to blur and he 
couldn’t make them out. He held 
the primer closer to his eyes, but 
still he couldn’t read the words. 
It was as though the page had 
turned to water and the words 
were swimming beneath the sur- 
face. He tried with all his might 
to see them, but his voice stum- 
bled worse than ever. 

Then he became aware that 
Miss Smith had walked down the 
aisle and was standing over him. 
She was carrying a ruler and her 

92 



face was strange, sort of pinched 
and ugly. She snatched the book 
from his hands and slammed it on 
the desk. She seized his right 
hand and flattened it out in her 
own. The ruler came down on 
his palm with stinging force. His 
hand tingled and the pain shot 
up his arm and went all through 
him. Miss Smith raised the ruler, 
brought it down again — 

And again and again and again. 

Ronnie began to cry. 

^^HE principal had had a long 
hard day and he didn’t feel 
much like talking to Mr. and Mrs. 
Meadows. He wanted to go home 
and take a relaxing bath and then 
tune in on a good telempathic 
program and forget his troubles. 
But it was part of his job to pla- 
cate frustrated parents, so he 
couldn’t very well turn them 
away. If he’d known they were 
going to come ’coptering out to 
the educational center, he would 
have put off notifying them till 
morning, but it was too late to 
think of that now. 

“Send them in,” he said wear- 
ily into the intercom. 

Mr. and Mrs. Meadows were a 
small, shy couple — production- 
line workers, according to Ron- 
nie’s dossier. The principal had 
little use for production-line work- 
ers, particularly when they 
spawned — as they so frequently 
did — emotionally unstable chil- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dren. He was tempted to slant the 
interrogation lights into their 
faces, but he thought better of it, 

“You were notified that your 
son was all right,” he said disap- 
provingly, when they had seated 
themselves. “There was no need 
for you to come out here.” 

“We we were worried, sir,” 
Mr. Meadows said. 

“Why were you worried? I told 
you when you first reported your 
son missing that he’d try to return 
to his empathic existence and that 
we’d pick him up here as soon as 
he showed up. His type always 
wants to return, but unfortunately 
we can’t classify our charges prior 
to placing them on the delivery 
train, since doing so would re- 
quire dispelling the empathic illu- 
sion at an inopportune time. Dis- 
pelling the illusion is the parents’ 
job, anyway, once the child is in- 
tegrated in reality. Consequently 
we can’t deal with our potential 
misfits till they’ve proven them- 
selves to be misfits by running 
away.” 

“Ronnie isn’t a misfit!” Mrs. 
Meadows protested, her pale eyes 
flashing briefly. “He’s just a highly 
sensitive child.” 

“Your son, Mrs. Meadows,” the 
principal said icily, “has a pro- 
nounced Oedipus complex. He be- 
stowed the love he ordinarily 
would have felt for you upon his 
fictitious teacher. It is one of those 
deplorable anomalies which we 

LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE 



cannot foresee, but which, I as- 
sure you, we are capable of cor- 
recting, once it reveals itself. The 
next time your son is reborn and 
sent to you, I promise you he 
won’t run away!” 

“The corrective treatment, sir,” 
Mr. Meadows said. “Is it pain- 
ful?” 

“Of course it isn’t painful! Not 
in the sense of objective reality.” 

H e was trying to keep his 
mounting anger out of his 
voice, but it was difficult to do so. 
His right hand had begun to 
twitch and that made his anger 
all the worse, for he knew that the 
twitching meant another spell. 
And it was all Mr. and Mrs. 
Meadows’ fault! 

These production-line imbe- 
ciles! These electrical-appliance 
accumulators! It was not enough 
to free them from the burden of 
bringing up their children! Their 
piddling questions had to be an- 
swered, too! 

“Look,” he said, getting up and 
walking around the desk, trying 
to keep his mind off his hand, 
“this is a civilized educational 
system. We employ civilized 
methods. We are going to cure 
your son of his complex and make 
it piossible for him to come and 
live with you as a normal red- 
blooded American boy. To cure 
him of his .complex, all we need 
to do is to make him hate his 

93 



teacher instead of love her. Isn’t 
that simple enough? 

“The moment he begins to hate 
her, the valley will lose its abnor- 
mal fascination and he will think 
of it as normal children think of 
it — as the halcyon place where he 
attended elementary school. It 
will be a pleasant memory in his 
mind, as it’s intended to be, but 
he won’t have any overwhelming 
urge to return to it.” 

“But,” Mr. Meadows said hesi- 
tantly, “won’t your interfering 
with his love for his teacher have 
some bad effect upon him? I’ve 
done a little reading in psychol- 
ogy,” he added apologetically, 
“and I was under the impression 
that interfering with a child’s nat- 
ural love for its parent — even 
when that love has been trans- 
ferred— can leave, well, to put it 
figuratively, scar tissue.” 

The principal knew that his 
face had gone livid. There was a 
throbbing in his temple, too, and 
his hand was no longer merely 
twitching; it was tingling. There 
was no doubt about it — he was 
in for a spell, and a bad one. 

f^COMETIMES I wonder,” he 
^ said. “Sometimes I can’t 
help but wonder what you people 
expect of an educational system. 
We relieve you of your offspring 
from the day of their birth, en- 
abling both parents to work full 
time so that they can afford and 

94 



enjoy all of the luxuries civilized 
beings are entitled to. We give 
your offspring the best of care: 
We employ the most advanced to- 
tal identification techniques to 
give them not only an induced 
elementary education but an em- 
phatic background as well, a back- 
ground that combines the best 
elements of Tom Sawyer, Re- 
becca of Sunnybrook Farm, and 
A Child’s Garden of Verses. 

“We employ the most advanced 
automatic equipment to develop 
and maintain unconscious oral 
feeding and to stimulate the 
growth of healthy tissue. In short, 
we employ the finest educational 
incubators available. Call them 
mechanized extensions of the 
womb if you will, as some of our 
detractors insist upon doing, but 
no matter what you call them, 
there is no gainsaying the fact 
that they provide a practical and 
efficient method of dealing with 
the plethora of children in the 
country today, and of preparing 
those children for home-high 
school and correspondence-col- 
lege. 

“We perform all of these ser- 
vices for you to the best of our 
ability and yet you, Mr. Mead- 
ows, have the arrogance to ex- 
press doubt of our competence! 
Why, you people don’t realize how 
lucky you are! How would you 
like to be living in the middle of 
the twentieth century, before the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



invention of the educational incu- 
bator? How would you like to 
have to send your son to some 
rundown firetrap of a public 
school and have him suffocate all 
day long in an overcrowded class- 
room? How would you like that, 
Mr. Meadows?” 

“But I only said — ” Mr. Mead- 
ows began. 

The principal ignored him. He 
was shouting now and both Mr. 
and Mrs. Meadows had risen to 
their feet in alarm. “You simply 
don’t appreciate your good for- 
tune! Why, if it weren’t for the 
invention of the educational incu- 
bator, you wouldn’t be able to 
send your son to school at all! 
Imagine a government appropri- 
ating enough money to build 
enough old-style schools and play- 
grounds and to educate and pay 
enough teachers to accommodate 
all the children in the country to- 
day! It woiild cost more than a 
war! And yet, when a workable 
substitute is employed, you ob- 
ject, you criticize. You went to 
the little red schoolhouse your- 
self, Mr. Meadows. So did I. Tell 
me, did our methods leave you 
with any scar tissue?” 

Mr. Meadows shook his head. 
“No, sir. But I didn’t fall in love 
with my teacher.” 

“Shut up!’’ The principal 



gripped the edge of the desk with 
his right hand, trying to stop the 
almost unbearable tingling. Then, 
with a tremendous effort, he 
brought his voice back to normal. 
“Your son will probably be on the 
next delivery train,” he said. “And 
now, if you will please leave — ” 

H e flicked on the intercom. 

“Show Mr. and Mrs. Mead- 
ows out,” he said to his secretary. 
“And bring me a sedative.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Mr. and Mrs. Meadows seemed 
glad to go. The principal was 
glad to see them leave. The tingl- 
ing in his hand had worked all 
the way up his arm to his shoul- 
der and it was more than a mere 
tingling now. It was a rhythmic 
pain reaching forty years back in 
time to the little red schoolhouse 
and beautiful, cruel Miss Smith. 

The principal sat down behind 
his desk and closed his right hand 
tightly and covered it protectively 
with his left. But it wasn’t any 
good. The ruler kept rising and 
falling, anyway, making a sharp 
thwack each time it struck his 
flattened palm. 

When his secretary came in 
with the sedative, he was trembl- 
ing like a little child and there 
were tears in his bleak blue eyes.

THE OCTOBER COUNTRY by 
Ray Bradbury. Ballantine Books, 
Inc., $3.50 

T T’S BEEN over two years since 
the last collection of Brad- 
bury shorts appeared and that’s 
much too long. Here we have 
nineteen of them, lots of rich 
reading. I have no way of telling 
which are from where and when, 
since I am doing this review from 
galleys. 

I remember having read the 
zany “Watchful Poker Chip of 
H. Matisse,” the story of the 
transformation of a brutal bore 

96 



into a fascinating bon vivant. 
“The Small .Assassin,” guaranteed 
to frighten pregnant women out 
of two full months, is another 
I recall from a previous anthol- 
ogy, as is “The Crowd,” a chiller 
that kept me a pedestrian on a 
holiday weekend. These can cer- 
tainly stand repetition. 

The quality of the other stories 
is somewhat uneven. There are 
wonderfully evocative mood tales 
such as “The Lake,” “The Wind” 
and “The Emissary.” I don’t 
think there’s anyone writing fan- 
tasy today who can send me back 
to my boyhood with such ease 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and credibility, and people the 
world with fresh wonder or hor- 
ror. Then there’s a "cutie, Auntie 
Tildy, who is strictly Anti-Death 
in “There Was An Old Woman.” 

“The Next in Line” I found 
disappointing because of a terrific 
buildup to a big letdown. “Jack- 
in-the-box” was routine. 

But that’s still quite an average. 

ANOTHER KIND by Chad 
Oliver, Ballantine Books, 3Sc 

T haven’t been able to figure out 
-*-just what Oliver means by his 
title, but that didn’t stop me 
from enjoying most of this col- 
lection of his. There are seven 
stories, two of them new. Six are 
pure science-fiction; “Transform- 
er,” from Fantasy & Science Fic- 
tion, is straight fantasy — a story 
of the unhappy and vengeful 
townspeople of a model railroad 
belonging to a sadistic young boy. 

Several of the other stories are 
anthropological studies. Two of 
them, “Rite of Passage” and 
“Scientific Method,” both deal 
with the initial contact of Man 
with alien races. The problems 
differ, however. 

In the former story, reminis- 
cent of John Campbell’s “Forget- 
fulness,” the difficulties stem from 
the difference in level of the two 
civilizations, while the latter deals 
amusingly with the similarity of 
approach of two comparably civi- 



lized races to the problem. 

“Artifact” is an interesting and 
plausible exposition of the adapta- 
bility of the human animal under 
seemingly impossible conditions 
and “A Star Above It” is a time 
travel story that conjectures what 
might-have-been if the Aztecs had 
had horses when Cortez began 
throwing his weight around. 

Altogether, a worthwhile 35c 
worth, with only one poor story 
in the lot, and that a shortie. 

THE LONG TOMORROW by 
Leigh Brackett. Doubleday & Co., 
Inc. $2.95 

A CCORDING to the jacket, 
Miss Brackett has a list of 
radio and screen credits as well 
as stories in many fields. But my 
previous knowledge of her work 
has been limited to The Starmen, 
Enchantress of Venus, etc., space 
opera from the old school, enjoy- 
able enough, but frankly escapist. 
Imagine my surprise and delight, 
then, when from the pen of the 
wife of Edmond Hamilton and 
the author of the above works 
comes this powerful and sensitive 
opus. 

The time is about fifty years 
or so after The Destruction. The 
survivors of the holocaust have 
caused a new amendment to the 
Constitution to be written, for- 
bidding concentration of popula- 
tion in excess of one thousand, or

more than eight hundred build- 
ings per square mile. Due to 
their knowledge of handicrafts 
and their lack of dependence on 
so-called luxuries, the Mennonites 
and Amish survived with hardly 
any difficulty and numbered mil- 
lions of converts two generations 
later. 

Two Mennonite youths, cousins 
cursed with imagination and curi- 
osity, disobey their fathers’ edicts 
and attend a religious revival, to 
see a trader stoned to death be- 
cause he is supposedly from 
“Bartorstown,” a legendary strong- 
hold of evil pre-Destruction 
knowledge. 

After stealing the dead man’s 
radio, they are torn between an 
understanding of the need to stay 
Man’s destructive nature by 
maintaining artificial curbs on 
dangerous information and the 
realization that stagnation is 
death. Their quest for “Bartors- 
town” and knowledge makes for 
a story of true stature. 

THE WHOOPING CRANE by 
H. C. Kreisheimer. Pageant Press, 
$2.50 

•'I'HIS slender volume somehow 
-*■ became overlooked during 
this column’s transition period. I 
was under the impression that 
Groff Conklin had written it up, 
so that accounts for this review 
of an item published last June. 

98 



According to publicity, Mrs. 
Kreisheimer is the widowed 
mother of four sons and two 
daughters. That makes it painful 
for me to say that I admire her 
for her effort, but cannot cheer 
its result. 

The author envisages a not- 
too-distant future world in which 
“Mazuria,” patently America, is 
the most powerful nation on 
Earth. The President’s personal 
secretary, a nice career girl, is 
very obviously cultivated by a 
suave, handsome, wealthy airline 
official whose company has blos- 
somed from a very recent begin- 
ning to the largest in the country. 

He obtains easy access to the 
President, but unfortimately be- 
gins to fall in love with Miss 
Secretary, who doesn’t suspect 
that he is a complete dupe, or 
dope, of the Communists. 

The Communists are refresh- 
ingly original in their plans to 
hamstring the various nations of 
the world, but they would require 
the unwitting help of a whole 
army of gullible career girls. I 
can’t believe there are that many. 

SECRET OF THE MARTIAN 
MOONS by Donald A. Wollheim. 
The John C. Winston Co., $2.00 

A NOTHER in the Winston 
series of juveniles, this con- 
tinues Wollheim’s personal “Sec- 
ret” series. Does he have science 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fiction True Confessions in mind? 

Mars has been colonized for a 
century without any progress be- 
ing made toward discovering the 
manner of entrance into the 
sealed closets, tunnels and cav- 
erns of the native Martians. 
Seems as if they left behind them 
perfect cities that the Earth col- 
onists have been using, some- 
what like an aborigine tenting in a 
split-level, but no way has been 
found to power any of the obvi- 
ously superior appliances. 

Young Nelson Parr, bom on 
Mars, is returning home after 
studying on Earth. Someone 
breaks into his room and leaves a 
weird three-fingered, feathery 
handprint on his mirror. Why 
should anyone do this? Well, af- 
ter a hundred years. Earth is 
abandoning Mars, ostensibly be- 
cause of logistical reasons, but ac- 
tually because of pressure from 
higher up. Someone or something 
wants Earthmen off Mars. The 
young reader will be surprised to 
learn who and why. 

Wollheim has some interesting 
theories on the origin of Deimos 
and Phobos and also of the hu- 
man species. There’s a slackening 
of ingenuity midway through, but 
Wollheim can be forgiven be- 
cause he exerted himself so ima- 
ginatively fore and aft. 

“SOUND BARRIER’’ by Neville 



Duke and Edward Lanchbery. 
Philosophical Library, $4.75 

^T^HE title is in quotes since the 
-*■ authors of this text explain 
that the speed of sound, contrary 
to popular belief, does not consti- 
tute an actual barrier through 
which a pilot has to crash his 
plane. This is the least of the in- 
formation that the authors im- 
part. I had no difficulty following 
their explanations, although I 
wouldn’t go so far as to say that 
the book is written in a breezy 
style. 

The contents include a com- 
prehensive section on various 
wing designs; the physiological 
effects of high-speed, high-alti- 
tude flying; piston, jet, turbo-jet 
and rocket 'engines, and an inter- 
esting section on theoretical and 
practical design. 

Liberally spotted throughout 
the book as well are very sharp 
photographs of jets and rockets, 
some of which seem straight from 
the drawing boards of H. Wesso 
and Elliot Dold of the mid-thir- 
ties, the days of mechanical sci- 
ence fiction. 

The authors— British, you knew 
—apologize to their readers for 
having used so many airplanes of 
American design. Claim we have 
a tendency to blab more about 
our secret aircraft. Golly, do we?

SLAVE SHIP 

By FREDERIK POHL 



Some assignment for a man who wanted to help win the war that 
wasn't a war! What did cows have to do with the Cow-dye enemy? 




Illustrated by EMSH 

Part 1 of a 3-Part Serial 



W E HAD had a guided- 
missile scare on the 
flight down from Mon- 
tauk, but it turned out to be one 
of our own. It came screaming 
hungrily in at us, clearly visible 
through the windows of the trans- 



port plane, and you could hear 
forty people taking a deep breath 
at once. But its IFF radar rec- 
ognized us at the last moment. 
It veered off, spun around and 
nosed away, hunting a Caodai — 
not that there was much chance

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of finding any over the American 
coast there. Outside of that, the 
flight to Boca Raton was most 
relaxing. 

I helped the girl I had been 
talking to down from the jet 
transport. She was only a rating, 
but very attractive. She thanked 
me and offered me a lift 

“Negative, Madam,” I said. 
“I’ll be met.” 

She extended her hand and, 
after a second, I shook it. “It’s 
been fun. Lieutenant. Perhaps 
we’ll meet again, if you’re going 
to be stationed in the area.” 

I said, “Of course.” It was am- 
biguous, but I meant to be. Per- 
haps it would not have mattered 
for me to mention how long I 
expected to be in the area. But 
perhaps it would. 

In any case, there was the fact 
of her being an enlisted woman. 



SLAVE SHIP 



101 



And there was also my wife. 

There wasn’t any helicopter 
waiting. I took my orders out and 
phoned the number they gave. A 
voice at the other end guessed — 
rather offhandedly, I thought — 
that they would get someone 
down to meet me pretty soon, and 
for a moment I considered taking 
his name and rank. But I hung 
up instead. I claimed my baggage 
and went into the coffee shop at 
the airport. 

W HILE the corporal behind 
the counter was bringing 
my coffee, I noticed a coin-in-the- 
slot typewriter standing idle. So 
I arranged with the Wac T/5 at 
the stationery stand for paper 
and three sheets of carbon and, 
when I had finished the coffee, 
got busy with my compliance 
letter. I typed: 

PROJECT MAKO

X-SaT-32880515 

Frcxm: Lieutenant (j.g.) Logan

Pers, X-SaT, dated 3d

am reporting for duty. 

(s) Logan Warren Moeller. 

It always pays to get a little 

102 



bit ahead in the Navy, I have 
found. I returned the sheets of 
carbon, clipped one copy of the 
compliance letter into my per- 
sonal file folder and folded the 
other three into an envelope — 
on which, with some pleasure, I 
lettered the words crash priority. 

Then I sat back and waited for 
what might happen. And still no 
helicopter. 

“You’ll have to move. Lieu- 
tenant,” said a stocky marine with 
a Shme Patrol armband. “Prison- 
ers coming through.” 

I got out of the way. A trans- 
pK>rt had landed and a file of 
short, wiry-looking Caodais was 
coming down the ramp, hands 
clasped atop their heads, armed 
SP guards covering them. I 
looked at them curiously. It was 
the first time I had seen the 
enemy in the flesh and they didn’t 
look much like the posters in the 
heads at training camp. These 
were a little too dark, I thought, 
to be from Indochina; perhaps 
from the satellite states in the 
Near East. 

“Row’d you like to come up 
against those babies in a fight?” 
asked an Air Force captain stand- 
ing by my side. 

“I often have,” I said, and went 
back to the telephone booth. I felt 
a little ashamed of myself for 
snubbing him. Still, it was true 
enough — we had our share of 
engagements aboard Spruance 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and these Stateside heroes give 
me a pain. 

Project Mako’s operations room 
was surprised. “You mean they 
didn’t pick you up, Lieutenant?” 
a man’s voice said. “Hold on.” 

I held on, and after a while the 
voice returned. “Sorry, Lieuten- 
ant,” it said breathlessly. “The 
pilot fouled up. Give him fifteen 
minutes.” 

rpHE WAITING ROOM was 
jammed with prisoners now, 
maybe a hundred of them. They 
were a quiet lot, for prisoners. 
There was roughly one tommy- 
gun-carrying SP for every three 
unarmed Caodais, but it still gave 
me a creepy feeling to be so close 
to them. Even in action, the near- 
est I had ever been to a living 
Caodai aboard Spmance was a 
thousand yards of himdred- 
fathom water. 

The Air Force captain gave me 
an injured look from where he 
was gaping at the Caodais, so I 
walked in the other direction. It 
was the first time I had ever 
been in Florida, and from the 
observation deck of the airport, 
I could see a skyline of palm 
trees and hibiscus, just as the 
travel booklets had promised — 
back in the days when there were 
travel booklets. Those were 
pretty remote days, I told myself, 
only three or four years, but I 
had been a civilian then, and so 



was my wife. The whole country 
was civilian then, barring eight or 
ten million cadres. It was hard 
to remember — 

There was confusion and shout- 
ing behind me. “Grab him! No, 
stand back, you idiots! Give him 
a chance to breathe! He’s hurt!” 
I turned and reached for the 
sidearm that I wasn’t carrying — 
it was pure reflex, because my 
first thought was that the prison- 
ers were making a break. 

But it wasn’t the prisoners. It 
was my friend from the wild blue 
yonder and he was staggering 
and screaming, clutching his side. 
A couple of Navy men were try- 
ing to’ hold him, but he didn’t 
even know they were there. 

I started to run toward him, 
me and everybody else in sight. 
But it was a little late. He yelled 
something hoarse and loud, and 
fell over against the yeoman by 
his side, and you had only to 
look at him slumping to the floor 
to know that he was dead. 

I stood there for a moment, 
staring at him. He had a dream- 
er’s face, a kid not more than 
twenty or so, but he would never 
reach twenty-one. 

In a moment, the field medics 
were there and they carried him 
into an office, and everybody in 
sight asked the man next to him: 
“What happened?” 

The loudest of the theories was 
that one of the Caodais had 



SLAVE SHIP 



103 



smuggled a gun in and potshot 
the captain, but the shore patrol 
was positive that was imp)ossible. 
Impossible, first, that they could 
have had guns; even more impos- 
sible that any of them could have 
leaned past the guards at the 
waiting room doors and fired 
without the guard noticing it. 

The only people who might 
have had any information — the 
Navy yeoman who had been be- 
side him and the medical officer 
from the field — were closeted 
inside the office, and there was 
an S.P. guard outside the closed 
office door who obviously didn’t 
know anything and wouldn’t tell 
you if he did. 

It was a pretty exciting intro- 
duction to Florida. It got even 
more exciting, in a way, a few 
moments later. There was a 
screeching siren outside and three 
Army officers wearing the Intel- 
ligence insigne came leaping up 
the steps two at a time. They dis- 
appeared into the closed office 
and stayed there. 

That disposed of the faint pos- 
sibility that it had been a natural 
death. Peculiar, I thought, that 
they should have got Intelligence 
there in such a hurry. 

But I didn’t know quite how 
p>eculiar it was. 

'T’HE HELICOPTER from Pro- 
ject Mako finally picked me 
up. The pilot, a short old CPO, 

104 



was only moderately apologetic. 
“I forgot,” he said cheerfully. 
“Say, what’s all the excitement?” 

I told him, overlooking the fact 
that he was in sloppy uniform 
and seemed a little extra careful 
not to breathe on me. 

“Killed him, hey?” he ex- 
claimed, impressed. “You don’t 
say!” 

But the ’copter looked ship>- 
shape enough, in its freshly 
painted Navy markings, and the 
chief seemed to know what he 
was doing as he took off. 

We aimed at one of the tower- 
ing cumulo-nimbus down the 
shore, a mountain of a cloud — 
boiling puffs of whipped cream 
piled over one another, the frayed 
thunderhead anvil teetering at 
the top. 

The CPO pointed at it with his 
chin. 

“Gonna have a storm. Lieu- 
tenant. We get one every after- 
noon about this time. But don’t 
worry, Charlie’ll beat it in.” 

“Good,” I said crisply. 

“Sure we will,” he told me re- 
assuringly. He took one hand off 
the steering column to scratch 
and peered at me, leaning slightly 
forward and cocking his head. 
“Say, Lieutenant,” he said ami- 
ably, “do you ever go to the 
races?” 

“I haven’t had much oppor- 
tunity lately. I’ve just come from 
a forward area.” I was almost 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



certain the man had been drink- 
ing. 

“Tsk, too bad.” He was still 
leaning forward, still staring at 
me; his eyes were blinking in 
a slow, regular cycle. Then he 
scratched again and took a negli- 
gent look at his instruments and 
the sky. “Good track at Boca. 
Only greyhounds, of course. You 
have to go clear to Miami if you 
want horses. I did that last liberty 
and I won a hundred and eighty 
dollars.” 

“Good for you,” I said. 

He shrugged modestly. “Oh, I 
don’t know. One of the other 
farmhands cleaned up a thousand 
right here in Boca on the dogs. 
He hit the double twice, betting 
quinellas.” 

I looked at him curiously. 
“Farmhands?” I repeated. Of 
course, the Navy knew what it 
was doing, and if it chose to pull 
me off a Nimitz-class cruiser in 
Caodai waters to send me to Flor- 
ida, that was COMINCH’s busi- 
ness, not mine. 

He said, “Huh?” 

“Did you say you were a farm- 
hand?” 

He guffawed. “Naw, Lieuten- 
ant, I’m a toe-dancer. Sure I’m 
a farmhand — what else would 
I be doing here?” 

That time I caught a whiff of 
his breath. I had been pretty sure 
he had been either drinking or 
popping. The breath told me 



wWch; you could have put ice 
cubes in it and served it at a 
cocktail party. 

¥ T WAS unfortunate that the 

first rating I had encountered 
from Mako was dnmk on duty, 
or the next thing to it. One of the 
most difficult problems a junior 
officer faces is keeping to the 
right side of the thin borderline 
between an easy relationship with 
the enlisted men on one hand, 
and outright Asiatic lack of dis- 
cipline on the other. 

I didn’t want to start out on 
my new base by putting a man 
on report. I let it go, with some 
doubt in my mind. But the new 
base was beginning to sound 
strange — farmhands! — and it 
seemed to me that I’d best get my 
bearings. 

Anyway, drunk or sober, he 
was flying the helicopter well 
enough. 

And he seemed a friendly type. 
He picked a battered pair of 
glasses off the floor and handed 
them to me. “Prison camp.” He 
pointed below. “Take a look if 
you want to. Lieutenant.” 

They were good glasses and 
we were only a few hundred feet 
up. I could see, very clearly, the 
scattered compounds inside the 
barbed wire and the sentry tow- 
ers all around. There seemed to 
be something going on inside the 
compound, a procession of some 



StAVE SHIP 



105 



kind, with paper dragons and 
enormous paper figures. I spotted 
a dragon with a man’s head, a 
paper Oriental temple, easily 
eight feet high, and all sorts of 
Mardi Gras trimmings. 

“What’s the celebration?” I 
asked. 

The chief took a quick look 
through the glasses and returned 
them to me. “Ah, who knows?” 
he said genially. “They go on like 
that a lot. Did you see old Victor 
Hugo?” 

I stared. “Victor who?” 

“Hugo. The paper dragon 
there, with Victor Hugo’s head 
on it,” he explained. “See it? Vic- 
tor Hugo’s one of their saints, 
like. Funny, isn’t it. Lieutenant? 
The guards give them the card- 
board to make those things. It 
keeps the Cow - dyes out of 
trouble, I guess.” 

Victor Hugo! I stared through 
the glasses until the camp was 
out of sight. There they were — 
the enemy — the members of 
the religious cult that had 
stormed out of old Vietnam and 
swept over most of three con- 
tinents — 

And appeared to be about 
ready to take on a couple more. 

'I ’HE CPO leaned back and 
stared at the clouds. He was 
motionless for so long that I be- 
gan to wonder if he was asleep. 
But at some unremarked sign be- 



low, he heeled the stick over and 
said: 

“Here’s your new home. Lieu- 
tenant” 

I looked over the sill of the 
window. A cluster of buildings 
and what seemed to be pasture 
lands; groves of palm trees and 
more pasture. 

“It looks like a dairy farm,” 
I said. 

“Right on the button. Lieuten- 
ant,” he agred. But he winked. 
“Kind of a peculiar dairy farm, 
though. You’ll find out.” 

He cut the switch at the edge 
of a plowed field. There was no 
suggestion of securing the mach- 
ine. We jumped out and left it, 
bags and all. 

“Come on. Lieutenant,” he said. 
“I think the commander’s in the 
milkshed.” 

Milkshed! But that’s what it 
was; I could see for myself. The 
chief led that way toward a low, 
open - sided building. My feet 
were ankle-deep in black soil. 

Three or four men in coveralls 
were putting a herd of cattle 
through a milking stall. My guide 
went up and spoke to one of 
them, a tall, rawboned redhead in 
ripp>ed, soiled coveralls, while I 
looked around for the com- 
mander. 

The redhead said, “Thanks, 
Charlie. Take his bags to the 
BOQ.” 

He came toward me, mopping 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his face with a bandanna, and 
right at that point I got a con- 
siderable setback. 

This hayseed cowhand, whose 
lantern jaw was a clear week be- 
hind a shave, wore pinned to the 
lapel of his dirty coveralls the 
gold leaf of a lieutenant com- 
mander in the U.N. Navy. 

“Welcome aboard, Moeller,” 
he said, sticking out his hand. 
“I’m Commander Lineback.” 
Well, I did the best I could, 
lacking an O.O.D. to report to, 
lacking,, colors to salute, lacking 
everything that made up the col- 
orful ritual of Navy reporting for 
duty. 

I asked myself a lot of ques- 
tions in that milkshed while I 
was waiting at Commander Line- 
back’s request for him to finish 
what he was doing. When finally 
he was done and he walked with 
me to his headquarters office, he 
said what the CPO had said on 
the ’copter; “This used to be a 
dairy farm, Moeller, and to a con- 
siderable extent it still is. But 
you’ll find it’s an unusual one.” 
And he went on to explain the 
operation of the dairy farm — 
how they planted forage for the 
cattle between rows of a cash 
crop, told the cattle what to eat 
and what to leave alone, how the 
cattle were far from bright and 
often had to be told a number of 
times before they understood. 
But, though I listened care- 



fully, he never said what was 
unusual about that. 

II 

Y OU HAVE to remember that 
I was fresh from the big-ship 
Navy. SpTuance was a twelve- 
thousand-tonner, a heavy under- 
sea cruiser with a complement of 
nine hundred officers and ratings, 
and you could shave in your re- 
flection from its brightwork. Pro- 
ject Mako was ... a dairy farm. 
And I was an officer of the line. 

Take the way Lineback had 
said: “Glad to have you aboard.” 
There wasn’t anything wrong 
with the words, but he smiled and 
it was the wrong kind of smile, 
as though he were kidding the 
Navy. 

In three years, I had learned 
that you do not — repeat : do not 
— kid the Navy. It isn’t a matter 
of flag-waving patriotism or any- 
thing like that; it’s jurt good 
sense. The Navy was doing a 
man-sized job with the Caodais. 
If it hadn’t been for the Navy, 
nothing in the world would have 
stopped them from opening up a 
beachhead somewhere along the 
coast of Guatemala, say, or 
Ecuador. 

They were used to jungles. 
Like the Japanese at Singapore, 
where the defending guns were 
firmly emplaced to face the only 
“possible” attack, from the sea — 



SLAVE SHIP 



107 



and the Jap>s had struck from 
the blind land side and won — 
once the Cow-dyes got a toehold 
anywhere in the Americas, they 
would plow their way right up 
and down the hemisphere. The 
jungle wouldn’t stop them, and 
by then it would be a little late 
for the fusion bombs. 

But the Navy stopped them, 
by doing things the Navy way. 
And you don’t kid an outfit that’s 
doing the job for you. 

Commander Lineback shoved 
me off on his exec, a full lieuten- 
ant named Kedrick. He was a 
pot-bellied little man, obviously 
over-age in grade, but at least he 
seemed pretty Navy — in a har- 
ried, fussbudget sort of way. He 
logged in my arrival, compli- 
mented me on my arrival, and 
listened to my mild complaint 
about the helicopter pilot. 

“Forgot to pick you up, eh? 
And drinking on duty, eh?” He 
sighed. “Well, Moeller, good men 
are hard to find.” And he showed 
me to my quarters. 

The B.O.Q. at Project Mako 
was what once had been a third- 
rate beachfront vacation hotel. 
The walls were paper and the 
rooms were made for midgets, 
but the plumbing was crystal and 
chrome. There was a magnificent 
view of the ocean. 

I was admiring it when Ked- 
rick said briskly: “Draw the cur- 
tains, man. It’s getting dark!” 

108 



1 LOOKED at him incredulous- 
ly. “Blackout?” I asked. With 
radar and infravision, visible light 
made no particular difference to 
hostile vessels. 

“Blackout,” he said firmly. 
“Don’t ask me why, but it’s 
orders, something to do with the 
Glotch, I guess. Maybe they 
think the Caodais are sending it 
over by frogman — they need 
regular light.” 

“Excuse me, but what is the 
Glotch?” 

“Good Lord, man, how would 
I know? All I know is, pieople 
drop down dead. They say it’s a 
Caodai secret weapon and they 
call it the Glotch — heaven 
knows why. Is this the first you’ve 
heard of it?’ 

I hesitated. There hadn’t been 
anything like that on Spruance, 
not even scuttlebutt. But it had 
a familiar sound. I told him about 
the Air Force captain at the air- 
port. 

He nodded. “Sounds like it. 
Now you know as much as any- 
body else.” He was looking tense, 
even for him. “We haven’t had 
it here — Mako’s a small station. 
But it’s happened right in Boca 
before. One of the guards at the 
stockade, a couple of weeks ago, 
and a transient before that.” He 
shrugged. “Not my problem,” he 
said, dismissing it. 

He turned and paused in the 
doorway of my quarters, looking 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



like nothing so much as a bell- 
boy waiting for his tip. 

He said; “The commander 
won’t have time to talk to you 
about your duties here for a 
while, Moeller. Matter of fact, 
I won’t, either. We’re expecting a 
new draft of officers and you’ll 
all get briefed at once — as much 
as you’ll get briefed, that is. Until 
then, you’ll have to cool your 
heels for a while.” 

“That’s all right, sir. It’ll give 
me a chance to look around the 
station.” 

“The devil it will, Moeller!” 
he said sharply. “Everything on 
the project is classified Top Sec- 
ret and Need-to-Know. You’ll get 
the word, when the time comes, 
from the commander, not before.” 
He scowled at me as though I 
were a suspected pacifist. “Mean- 
while, you’re restricted to the 
B.O.Q., the wardroom and the 
headquarters area. And make 
sure you stay there.” 

O RDERS were orders, so I 
stayed there. With nothing 
to do. 

Back on the cruiser, there had 
been plenty to do. I was posted 
to Spruance as a computer officer, 
since I’d majored in cyt>ernetics; 
but as long as I was in a forward 
area, I wanted to fight. They 
were glad to accommodate me. 
There is almost always a place 
for a man who wants to fight in 



a war, even a cold one. 

I don’t know why they called 
it a cold war, anyhow — it seemed 
hot enough on Spruance. While 
I was aboard, we had three con- 
firmed Caodai kills — two mer- 
chantmen and a little surface 
corvette. 

Of course, they weren’t offici- 
ally Caodais; officially, they were 
“unidentified vessels in inter- 
dicted area.” But it was funny 
how the Caodai patrols never 
sank any “unidentified” Asian or 
African shipping, any more than 
the U.N. fleet bothered the Amer- 
ican. I suppose that if either side 
had intercepted a European 
ship, it would have been quite 
a problem for the commander — 
if there had been any European 
ships for anybody to intercept. 

They called it a cold war. But 
fourteen million of our men were 
hotting it up over in Europe, 
against twenty or so million of 
theirs. Our land casualties were 
comparatively low — in the low 
millions, that is. 

And no state of war. 

There was just this one little 
thing: Our troops were killing 
theirs all the way from the Pjrre- 
nees to the White Sea in local 
“police actions.” 

Well, it really wasn’t a war, 
rot in the old-fashioned sense. 
For one thing, it wasn’t country 
against country, the way it used 
to be when things were simple. 



SLAVE SHIP 



109 



It was confederation, the United 
Nations, against a Church Mili- 
tant, the Caodais. They were a 
religion, not a nation; they hap- 
pened to be a religion with troops 
and battlewagons and fusion 
bombs, but a religion all the 
same. And how can you declare 
war against a religion? 

Our ambassadors still main- 
tained an uneasy residence in 
Nguyen-Yat-Hugo’s court. Every 
day or so, the ambassador would 
show up at Vat’s giant Cambo- 
dian temple with a fresh note of 
protest over some fresh killing 
and the answer was always: 

“Sorry, but you had better take 
that to the Iranian (or Pakistani 
or Saudi-Arabian or Vietnamese) 
authorities, not us.” And diploma- 
tic relations went limpingly on. 
And so did a certain amount of 
trade, so you could tell that it 
wasn’t really a war. 

But the best way to tell was 
that the fusion bombs stayed 
nicely tucked into their satellite 
launchers, theirs and ours. Silly? 
Not so very silly, no — the bomb 
was all too able to end the “war” 
overnight. By ending everything. 

So everybody played the same 
game, we and the Caodais, be- 
cause everybody had the same 
powerful desire to keep the fu- 
sion bombs right where they 
were. The rules were fairly sim- 
ple: No landings in force on the 
enemy continents (but islands 

no 



were fair game). No attacks on 
enemy shipping in “open” waters 
(but sink anyone you like in in- 
terdicted areas — and interdict 
any waters that suit your fancy). 
But it was never called war. 

For some people, it was a 
pretty high-stakes game. Not so 
much for me, you understand, 
though Spruance had been in a 
forward area — we’d never come 
up against anything as big as 
we were. But it was a mighty 
rough police operation for the 
ones who saw water hammer in 
when the depth bomb connected, 
the ones who took a hunk of 
gelignite in the navel, the ones 
who lost a wing at thirty thou- 
sand feet and found the escape 
hatch buckled. 

But not for me. Especially not 
at Project Mako. 

' I ^HE NEXT morning, I waited 
hopefully at breakfast for 
someone to tell me to report for 
briefing. 

Nobody did. 

It was raining and everybody 
else seemed to have work to do, 
so I picked some books out of 
the shelf in the wardroom — Ma- 
han and Jellicoe — and talked the 
mess boy out of some coffee. It 
never hurts to refresh yourself 
on classical tactics. 

Commander Lineback came 
slouching through the wardroom 
just before lunch while I was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



reading The Grand Fleet. He 
gave me a strange look. 

“Glad to see you’re improving 
your mind,” he said. “Everything 
going all right?” 

“Well, yes, sir,” I said, “ex- 
cept — ” 

“Glad to hear it,” he said, and 
was gone. 

I was getting tired of being 
treated like an interloper. 

I told myself that COMINCH 
didn’t think I was an interloper; 
COMINCH, from the majesty of 
his hve stars, had picked me out 
of Spruance and crash-prioritied 
me to this hole in the Florida 
swamp. Maybe Lieutenant-Com- 
mander Lineback didn’t have 
time to bother with me, but I 
was a skilled and talented naval 
officer and not constitutionally 
fitted for being a bum. 

I had thirty-five sweeps to my 
own credit — ranging up to a 
himdred miles from Spruance in 
my little battery-powered scout 
torp — and though I didn’t have 
any kills, I had an official assist 
on the corvette. I’d flushed it 
right into Spruance’s jaws. 

After lunch, everybody disap- 
peared again and I was tired of 
the wardroom. I put on my oil- 
skins and wandered around the 
headquarters area, watching the 
big, warm drops smash the bou- 
gainville blooms. It was kind of 
pretty, Florida was; I thought 
about maybe some day, my wife 



and I, coming here for a second 
honejnnoon . 

If I ever saw her again. 

Maybe, I thought to myself 
urgently, walking a little faster, 
maybe if I put it to the com- 
mander right, he’d let me go into 
town and I could have a few 
drinks, even p>op a couple. 

But it wouldn’t do any good. 
I’d tried drinking and it didn’t let 
me forget that my wife was a 
long, long way away. I kicked at 
the watery hibiscus morosely. It’s 
tough enough to go to war and 
leave the girls behind you. 

But what about when they 
don’t stay behind you? 

“Moo-oo.” 

I looked up, startled. 

1 HAD been thinking, not watch- 
ing where I Was going. I had 
wandered along a shell-bordered 
walk, past a truck garden the en- 
listed men kept on the side, into 
a grove of coconut palms. And on 
the other side of the palms was 
a shack, and in the shack a cow 
was monotonously lowing. 

The question was: was I still 
in the headquarters area? 

I looked around me. Nobody 
had told me exactly what the 
headquarters area was, I re- 
minded myself defensively. It 
wasn’t my fault if I was out- 
side it. 

The shack had one curious fea- 
ture, considering that a cow was 



SLAVE SHIP 



ni 



lowing inside it — it had only 
a regular human-azed door. 
There were windows, but I could- 
n’t see through them. I could 
hear all right, though. 

That cow sounded unhappy — 
sick, perhaps, or wanting to be 
milked, though it was only the 
middle of the afternoon. “Moo- 
oo,” it went, and then, in a lower 
key with a sort of grant at the 
end: “Moo-oo-oo!” Then the first 
one again, and the second, in an 
alternation too regular to be be- 
lieved. 

Well, what could be more na- 
tural than to hear cattle lowing 
on a dairy farm? But the regu- 
larity bothered me and so did 
the door. I walked closer. 

And the door opened in my 
face. 

Lieutenant Kedrick was stand- 
ing there, turned away, talking to 
a hawk-faced j.g. whom I had 
seen at lunch. The j.g. was ges- 
turing with a spool of recording 
tap>e; he saw me over Kedrick’s 
shoulder and his expression 
changed. 

Kedrick turned around. 

“Moeller,” he said. 

I cleared my throat. “Aye-aye, 
sir.” 

He stepped closer to me an- 
grily. Rain was splattering off his 
slicker, but he hardly noticed. 
He raged: “Curse it, Moeller, you 
were restricted to the area! Re- 
port to my quarters right now!” 

112 



“Sir, I — ” 

“On the double!” 

I saluted, said crisply: “Aye- 
aye, sir!” I left. 

T WO HOURS later, Kedrick 
showed up in his two-room 
suite and he wasn’t in a very good 
frame of mind. I leaped to atten- 
tion as he came dripping in the 
door. 

He said furiously, “At ease, 
Moeller!” He peeled off his 
slicker and threw it on the tiled 
floor of his private bath. “Moel- 
ler,” he said, taking his wet shoes 
off, “you were restricted to head- 
quarters area. I don’t make the 
rules on this base; that wasn’t tny 
idea. Get it through your head, 
Moeller! This place is hot!” 

I said, “Yes, sir. I — ” 

“The hottest installation in the 
Navy,” he went on. “Now ask me 
why the hottest installation in 
the Navy has fifteen hundred 
PWs in a stockade on its door- 
step. I don’t know. Ask me how 
I’m supposed to keep security 
when they send me idiots from 
the forward areas, with no brief- 
ing and no brains. I don’t know.” 
He kicked the second shoe into 
a corner and sat down. “First it’s 
activating this place,” he contin- 
ued, not even looking at me now, 
“trying to make a shipshape in- 
stallation out of a dairy farm, for 
God’s sake. Then it’s the Glotch. 
Then it’s the ratings going Asia- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tic. What next?” 

“Sir, I was only — " 

“Forget it,” he said morosely. 
“I talked to Commander Line- 
back about you and those are his 
orders. Forget it.” 

“Forget it, sir?” I repeated 
after a moment. 

“Commander Lineback,” he 
said heavily, “has been in the 
Navy exactly seven months. He 
tells me, ‘Moeller’s new here. Give 
him a chance.’ He says, “What’s 
the difference? Let him roam 
around the base all he wants. 
After he sees everything there is 
to see, I’ll brief him.’ He says. 
When it comes right down to 
that, there’s nothing to see, any- 
way — not imtil Moeller and the 
rest of them make something to 
see.’ That’s what Commander 
Lineback says. Commander Line- 
back thinks COMSOLANT exag- 
gerates the need for security at 
the present stage of this installa- 
tion’s development.” 

“He thinks COMSOLANT ex- 
aggerates it, sir?” I asked, 
shocked. 

“He’s only been in the Navy 
se’-en months,” repeated Lieuten- 
ant Kedrick, staring suicidally at 
the wall. 

Ill 

^f/~^SWIAK, sir, reporting to 
the lieutenant to give him 
the de-luxe tour, like Lieutenant 



Kedrick ordered,” the man said. 

“Carry on,” I said automatic- 
ally, rubbing the sleep out of my 
eyes. 

“Oh, I wasn’t at attention. 
Lieutenant,” he said cheerfully. 

I looked at him more carefully. 
It was Charlie, the helicopter 
pilot. “Give me five minutes,” I 
said. It was enough for a shower 
and dressing; according to my 
watch, I had already missed 
breakfast. 

I suppose that everyone is 
familiar with dairy farms, and 
that’s about all there was to see 
on Project Mako. I’d already seen 
enough to last me a lifetime. I 
had spent part of my teens doing 
summer work in upstate New 
York, where you can’t throw a 
rock between Albany and Ssrra- 
cuse without hitting somebod5^s 
Holstein. 

Of course. Southern cattle 
aren’t Holsteins, but they all op- 
erate about the same. Those at 
Project Mako (Oswiak informed 
me it had been the Volusia 
County Dairj'men’s Co-op Cen- 
ter) were divided in two herds, 
one purebred Santa Gertrudis, the 
other Brahman-Friesian cross- 
breds. 

But the husbandry was no 
different. The milksheds were the 
same; the forage was the same; 
the cattle themselves lowed and 
ate and were milked the same. 

Project Mako’s number two

crop happened to be hybrid teo- 
sinte, the Mexican bush com. 
Back in Cayuga County, we 
mostly used potatoes for the sec- 
ondary crop, but it didn’t matter: 
You plant your potatoes, or com, 
or anything you like in rows; you 
show the cattle your specimens of 
the money crop in its various 
stages of growth; and you ttim 
them loose. The cattle eat the 
weeds and leave the crop. They 
fertilize the pasture and the 
“weeds” make milk for you. 

They tell me the old folks used 
to do the same thing with geese 
and cotton. But it was just luck 
that geese didn’t like the taste 
of cotton stalks. With cows, by 
speaking their language, you 
could tell them what to eat and 
what to leave alone. 

“They aren’t really weeds, 
Lieutenant,” the chief said. 
“They’re hay, like.” 

“Sure,” I said. I knew more 
about it than he did. Naturally 
you don’t want your cattle eat- 
ing real weeds; best practice in 
Cayuga County was to sow a 
cover crop of one of the ladino 
grasses or hybrid clover — some- 
thing that will stand up under 
heavy grazing. Naturally you 
don’t want it to look too much 
like your money crop, either — 
cows aren’t bright. 

“So this is Project Mako,” I 
said. 

“All of it,” said Oswiak, grin- 



ning. “Ain’t it a beaut. Lieuten- 
ant?” 

A fter talking the stew- 
ard out of some coffee, I 
rested my feet in the wardroom. 

Oswiak was right: Project 

Mako was a beaut — that is, it 
was a beautiful dairy farm. 

But what was top secret about 
it? There was, it was true, one 
largish building that was next to 
empty, and all Oswiak knew 
about it was that equipment was 
due to arrive. There were two 
or three smaller buildings — the 
one where Lieutenant Kedrick 
had caught me out of bounds, 
for instance — that seemed a 
little ambiguous on a dairy farm. 
One was full of records of animal 
noises; another held cages — 
empty ones, the kind that you 
might keep white rats or monkeys 
in, if you were going to run a re- 
search laboratory. Oswiak didn’t 
know what they were for, either, 
except that they had something 
to do with animals. 

I had already figured that out. 
I stretched out and read a 
newspaper. 

The hawk-faced j.g. who had 
been with Kedrick came in and 
nodded. His name, I had found, 
was Hoglund. I offered him the 
paper and picked up a magazine; 
it was getting close to lunch time. 

“Look at that!” exclaimed Hog- 
lund, his hawk face wrathful. 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“The lousy, stinking rats!” 

I looked at the front page he 
was holding. His thumb was rest- 
ing on a piece headed: UMP July 
Call Put at 800,000; Manicurists, 
Bakers, Morticians Face Early 
Draft. 

I said: “They’ll get the whole 
country mobilized before long. I 
hear — ” 

“I’m not talking about the 
draft,” he corrected severely. 
“They got Winkler.- 

I’d read the story. It said: 
“General Sir Allardis Winkler, 
Military Attache of the United 
Kingdom Government in Exile, 
died at his home in Takoma 
Park, Maryland, last night of un- 
determined causes. General Win- 
kler’s body was discovered by a 
member of his family when — ” 
I looked at Hoglund wonder- 
ingly. “Friend of yours?” 

“Man, don’t you know what 
that is? That’s the GlotchJ They 
got Winkler, just the way they 
got Senator Irvine last spring. 
Who’s next? That’s what I want 
to know. Those damn Cow-dyes 
can pick us off, one by one, and 
we don’t know dirt from dand- 
ruff how to stop them.” 

I SAID: “Lieutenant, it doesn’t 
say anything here about the 
— ah — Glotch.” 

“Sure it doesn’t. Where’ve you 
been, man? Can’t you tell when 
they’re covering something up?” 



“I’ve been out of touch,” 
Hoglund snapped his fingers. 
“You’re the one from sea duty. 
You mean they didn’t have the 
Glotch there?” 

“Not that I ever heard of.” 
“You were lucky,” he said. “I 
bet if there’s been one, there’s 
been fifty cases in the paper in 
the last six months. General Win- 
kler dies of undetermined causes. 
Senator Irvine found dead in bed. 
District Mobilization Director 
Grossinger dead of stroke. 
‘Stroke,’ they say — sure, the 
Cow-dyes strike them dead. And 
not just big shots, but all kinds 
of people. Why — 

“I saw an Air Force captain — ” 
“Why, I bet there’s been thou- 
sarvls killed that we don’t even 
hear about.” He shook his head. 
“That guard at the stockade a 
while back, he never got in the 
papers. They — ” 

“This Air Force captain prob- 
ably — 

“They don’t tell us about it. 
You know why? Because they 
don’t know what to do. The big 
brass is scared witless. They’re 
trying blackouts, they’re trying 
this, they’re trying that. But they 
aren’t getting anywhere, believe 
me. 

He might have gone on for- 
ever, but the stewards appeared. 
“Chow, gentlemen.” 

I had sp>ent three hours min- 
utely examining a top secret 



SLAVE SHIP 



115 



Navy installation and I had lis- 
tened to an impassioned harangue 
on an enemy secret weapon. 

But I couldn’t honestly say 
that I’d learned a single thing 
about either one. 

I found Commander Lineback 
in the milkshed after lunch and I 
said just about that to him. 

He said: “You’ll get briefed, 
Moeller. I told you. We’re wait- 
ing for the rest of your draft to 
arrive." 

“Can I ask when that will be, 
sir?” 

tr E SIGHED. “Ask the Navy 
Department. The word is it 
might be a week.” 

“Commander Lineback, can’t 
you just give me an idea of what 
all this is about? You did let me 
look over the whole project, you 
know.” 

“And you saw everything there 
is to see.” 

“Buc it’s just a farm!” 

“Right,” he agreed. “Absolutely 
right.” One of the ratings saluted 
and asked if it was okay to start 
bringing the cows in and Line- 
back nodded. He said, talking to 
me but keeping his eyes on the 
cattle being nm in to the milking 
stalls: “Maybe you know as much 
as I do already, Moeller. Seven 
months ago, I was assistant pro- 
fessor of agronomy at Eau Claire. 
They called me up. They picked 
me right out of a classroom and

gave me e two-week indoctrina- 
tion course and sent me down 
here to activate this station. Did 
they tell me why?” 

“I don’t know, sir, but surely 
you have some idea — ” 

“Oh, maybe I have,” he ad- 
mitted. “Maybe a couple of the

“I don’t want to say anything 
against you, boy, but you’re get- 
ting to be a pain in the neck. 
We’ve got some stuff to be picked 
up in Miami at COMSOLANT 
in three days. Want to go down 
and pick it up?” 




other officers do, too. But until 
I’m told to pass on my ideas to 
you, I’ll keep them inside my 
own head where they belong. I’ll 
tell you this much — it has some- 
things or other to do with ani- 
mals.” 

“I figured that out for myself, 
sir,” I said bitterly, just as I had 
to Oswiak. 

“And we’ve got a lot of equip- 
ment coming — including some 
kind of electronic gizmo for you.” 
“That’s nice, sir. I get a milli- 
bank computer to help you figure 
out the price of butter.” 

He looked at me thoughtfully, 
but he didn’t say anything for a

what I need, a vacation from 
doing nothing.” 

“Yes or no, Moeller!” All of a 
sudden, he was a superior officer 
again. 

“Why — why, yes, sir.” I au- 
tomatically snapped to. 

He nodded. “Kedrick’ll fix up 
your orders.” He grinned. “You 
can leave this afternoon. They 
tell me Miami’s quite a place.” 
I said, “Sir, I — I’m sorry if 
I was out of line.” 

“Forget it.” 

“It’s just that — well, Spruance 
was more my kind of war.” He 
seemed like a human being. I

said hesitantly: “You see, sir, as 
long as I was in Caodai waters, 
there was always the chance of 
bagging a commando raid. And 
I have a special reason for want- 
ing to go to Zanzibar.” 

He looked at me alertly. “Zan- 
zibar? Nothing much there.” 
“Depends on how you look at 
it, sir.” 

I could see the moment when 
his expression changed as he re- 
membered. It was in my person- 
nel file, after all. “Oh. Your wife.” 
“That’s right, sir. She’s been 
interned in the big camp on Zan- 
zibar for two years.” 

He patted the brown neck of 
a cow absently. “Tough. Well, 
you didn’t have much chance of 
making it.” 

“Not much, sir. Now it’s not 
any.” 

He flicked the cow on the 
rump and she bumped stiffly 
over to the milking stall. A sea- 
man in dungarees and tee-shirt 
hitched the plastic cups to her 
teats and, through yards of trans- 
parent tubing, the milk pulsed to 
the settling tank. 

“Well,” Commmander Line- 
back said, “have a nice time in 
Miami. What did you say your 
wife’s name was?” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

He looked at me curiously. 
“Moeller?” he said, like a man 
who suspects his phone connec- 
tion has gone dead. 



“Yes, sir?” 

“Nothing. I just asked you 
what your wife’s name was.” 

I stood at attention. 

“Elsie, sir.” I saluted and left, 
quickly. 

IV 

T SIGNED the register and pre- 

sented my orders. 

The room clerk said: “Glad to 
have you here. Lieutenant; hope 
you’ll have a good time. Front!” 
He clapped his hands sharply. 

I mentioned: “I’m here on of- 
ficial busines.” He smiled know- 
ingly. 

The corporal who came over 
to pick up my Val-Pak must have 
been the bell captain. He waited 
embarrassingly. In spite of Navy 
regulations regarding cash gratui- 
ties to military personnel, I gave 
him a quarter. He didn’t give it 
back. Maybe the Army regula- 
tions were different. 

My room was thirty stories up, 
overlooking the ocean and the 
Gulf Stream. You could almost 
see the Stream — in fact, I’m not 
sure but what I did see it, a paler 
blue in the blue-violet of the in- 
shore waters. You could see quite 
a lot from my window. You could 
even see the sooty high-water 
mark along the white beaches, 
where the oil from sneak-raid tor- 
p>edoed tankers had washed 
ashore.

I changed into my dress greens, 
left my room key with the tech 
sergeant at the desk and headed 
for the headquarters of Com- 
mander, South Atlantic Theater. 

SPs in white leggings opened 
the door of my cab and saluted 
smartly. It was a hotel that made 
mine look like an outhouse; over 
its hibiscus-framed front doorway 
was the stainless-steel legend: 
COMSOLANT. The word was re- 
peated on the white life-preserv- 
ers that hung from the railings of 
the walks, on the caps of the 
elevator operators and the arm- 
patches of the SPs, and was even 
picked out in pastel tile on the 
deck around the swimming pool 
where I had been instructed to 
report. 

A petty officer read my orders 
skeptically, scratched his head 
and sent one of the SPs to the 
end of the pool. A hairy-bodied 
man in green trunks came back 
with the SP, toweling himself 
furiously. “Can’t I have even a 
lunch break, Farragut?” he de- 
manded. “What the devil is it 
now?” 

He read the orders and looked 
at me irritatedly. “Mako, Mako,” 
he repeated. ‘Whaf s Mako?” 

I looked quickly at the petty 
officer. “Classified, sir,” I whis- 
pered. 

He barked, ‘What the devil 
isn’t?” But he picked up a hush- 
phone from the petty officer’s 



desk and spoke into it for a 
moment. 

XT E HUNG up and said: 
“You’re early. Lieutenant 
Your commander was distinctly 
told that the issue wouldn’t be 
ready imtil Thursday.” 

“Sorry, sir,” I apologized. 

“Oh, not your fault.” He gave 
me back my orders — limp and 
blurry where he’d dripped on 
them. “Come back Thursday.” 

‘What shall I do until then, 
sir?” 

He looked at me imbelievingly. 
“This is Miami. Just be back here 
Thursday, that’s all.” And he 
dived wallowingly into the pool. 

So there I was, on my own in 
Miami. 

It had been, I counted, seven- 
teen months since I had walked 
the streets of an American city 
with time to kill. 

On Spruance, you didn’t take 
your leave, because where were 
you going to go? The whole thing 
about a nuclear-power submarine 
cruiser, after all, is that it doesn’t 
need to get back to home base 
very often. Spruance had been 
cruising for a year when I joined 
her, was still cruising now. 

There had been a couple of 
times when, for a day or so, we 
had touched at Bordeaux or 
Cork on some strategic errand, 
and some of us got to stretch oiu’ 
legs ashore. But have you ever

spent a festive evening in a heap 
of rabble? 

Neither has anyone else. 

Miami Beach, though, was fes- 
tive enough to make up for all. 
My hotel was bright and shiny, 
even though in the rundown dis- 
trict around Lincoln Road. The 
wonderful thing about spending 
a couple of days at the Beach is 
the pretty girls, for a wise provi- 
dence — perhaps a wise COM- 
SOLANT — had put the Waaf 
hostess-training center right next 
door in Coral Gables. Biscayne 
Boulevard was lined with them, 
seven days a week, all the weeks 
of the year. 

Lord knows when the girls 
foimd time to study — or perhaps 
their social life at Biscayne Bou- 
levard was a kind of extension 
course at the training center, be- 
cause what else does an airline 
hostess have to know? 

At any rate, they were there — 
as many as the reminiscing boys 
on Spmance had said, and as 
pretty. They were the sweetest- 
looking, gayest-laughing, homiest- 
seeming things I had seen in 
seventeen months; and four out 
of ten of them, seen from a dis- 
tance, had the same waved 
brownish hair and carefree walk 
of Elsie. 

Elsie. It was more than two 
years since we had our last leave 
together. I stopped under a palm 
tree and looked, as ineonspicu- 

120 



ously as I could, at the picture in 
my wallet. She was almost a 
stranger. It hadn’t been so bad 
on Spruance, where there were 
few women and there had always 
been the faint chance of com- 
mandoing Zanzibar. 

But here in Miami, where 
everyone but me walked two-by- 
two, it was bad. I was lonesome. 

H er and her cursed volun- 
teering! I had told her and 
told her, long before her number 
came up: “When they get you, 
don’t volunteer for anything.” 

So naturally she had signed on 
the courier flight to Nhatrang in 
Indo-China, where the Caodai 
headquarters were, and naturally 
the courier had wandered off 
course over Yemen, and naturally 
the Caodais niked him down. 

It wasn’t Elsie they were in- 
terested in; the game they were 
after was the air marshal in 
whose staff she was a yeoman. 
He’d be a valuable hostage in 
some future exchange. And they 
nabbed him. She was lucky she 
got out in time — and twice as 
lucky that they’d eventually 
shipped her to the big internment 
camp on Zanzibar, along with the 
marshal. 

But me, I was hardly lucky at 
all. 

I had a large glass of fresh 
orange juice at a sidewalk cafe 
and talked with a Waaf at the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



next table. She was a very at- 
tractive blcMjde; she would have 
been fun to take out — if she had 
been Elsie. 

I walked two blocks and had 
a guanabana sherbet at another 
sidewalk cafe, and talked with a 
Waaf sitting next to me at the 
counter. She was a very attrac- 
tive brunette, but she wasn’t Elsie 
either. 

I considered a third sidewalk 
cafe featuring fresh papaya-pine- 
apple drinks. But there is a limit 
to the amount of liquid I can 
stand sloshing around in me. 

Glamorous Miami! I was pre- 
pared to sell it short, that hot 
afternoon. It wasn’t that Miami 
wasn’t very nice. It was too nice 
for a lonely man. I was battling 
a sort of perverse inanimate con- 
spiracy against me on the part of 
the Sun, the sky, the weather. If 
Elsie had been with me, I would 
have been happy. 

But she wasn’t. 

There was only one thing to 
do. 

I had been resisting doing it 
ever since Fd landed at Montauk, 
en route to Project Mako. I 
couldn’t resist it any more. 

I found a phone booth, and 
the Classified book had what I 
wanted: Hartshome 8 e GicM'dano, 
F.C.C. Licensees, at an address 
near the Venetian Causeway. 

The heading was Telepathists 
8s Espers. 



T he girl at the desk was an 
enlisted Wave. It surprised 
me, for the last time I had used 
an esper, the whole outfit was ag- 
gressively civilian. 

She said doubtfully, “Zanzibar? 
That’s Caodai territory.” 

“I know it is,” I said patiently. 
“My wife is interned there.” 

She looked at me as though 
I were a pacifist or something, 
but she kept on filling out the 
forms. I gave her all the informa- 
tion she asked for, and she said: 
“You’re lucky. They say that 
all esp communication will be 
pre-empted for military use the 
first of the month. Now would 
you like this guaranteed or not?” 
“Non-guaranteed,” I said. The 
difference in the rate was con- 
siderable; besides, I’d had half 
a dozen previous rapports with 
Elsie. There wasn’t any doubt 
in my mind that I’d get through. 
That is, if she was still — 

Never mind that, I told m 3 rself 
quickly, and listened to the Wave. 
She was mumbling figures from 
a rate book and making marks 
on a pad. 

“Eleven dollars and ninety-five 
cents, including tax,” she said at 
last “That’s for three minutes.” 
She spoke into an intercom and 
nodded to me. “Mr. Giordano 
will see you now.” 

Giordano was a beady -eyed 
little old man with curly white 
hair. “Six previous rapports,” he

121 



said approvingly, studjdng my 
chart “Well, ten cc ought to be 
enough for you. Will you roll up 
your sleeve, please?” 

I looked away as the needle 
bit into my arm. It tingled; the 
hormone solution you take be- 
fore an esper rapport seems to be 
distilled from wasp venom. 

“Thank you,” he said, and I 
rolled down my sleeve as he sat 
down at his desk. He wasn’t much 
like the last esper I’d gone to, 
back in Providence, when Elsie 
was first interned. That one had 
worn a white tunic with a side- 
buttoned collar like a surgeon’s, 
and he had been a phony from 
the word go. Oh, he put me in 
touch with Elsie all right, but 
there had been a gauzy shape- 
lessness about the contact that 
had left me more unsatisfied 
when I left than when I came in. 

This one had a fine business- 
like air about him. He wore an 
ordinary Navy undress imiform 
with a chief warrant’s pin in his 
collar. That’s a more important 
factor in esping than most people 
realize. The Providence hookup 
had been the one real failure I 
had had with Elsie. 

I have the node, Lieu- 
tenant?” he asked. 

The “node” was the photo- 
graph of Elsie from my wallet. 
He studied it approvingly. Why 
is it that the photograph one car- 

122 



lies of a- girl is alwajrs in a bath- 
ing suit? Is it that the more you 
can see of a subject, the more 
vividly the image brings her 
back? Or just that one usually 
carries a camera to the beach? 

“Very nice,” he said. “Now how 
about your nodal experience?” 
“Well,” I said hesitantly, “just 
before the picture was taken, we 
had lunch on a terrace overlook- 
ing the beach. There was a band 
and we danced.” 

“And you remember the tune 
the band was playing?” I nodded. 
“Good. One other thing. Lieuten- 
ant. Do you know what time it 
is in Zanzibar now?” 

I snapped my fingers. “Oh, 
damn. She’ll be asleep?” 

He glanced at a chart and 
nodded. “It’s aroimd two in the 
morning there. Of course you can 
get rapport even if she’s asleep, 
you know, but she may not re- 
member it in the morning. Or 
she may think it’s a dream.” 
“We’ll try it.” I could always 
try again the next day, I told 
myself; the money didn’t matter. 

“Lean back,” he said gently, 
and the lights went out, all but a 
tiny, indirect one that softened 
the shadows but left nothing for 
the mind to fix on. 

I felt the esper come into my 
mind. I know that some people 
find that an ordeal, like the den* 
tist’s pick pr3dng into the bicu- 
spid. For me, it has always been 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a warming, protecting sort of' 
coming together. Perhaps it is 
because I’ve never esped anyone 
but Elsie and it hasn’t been a 
matter of exchanging data but of 
moods. Those who try to use 
espers for business calls, trying 
to pinpoint details in a cloudy 
contact, must find the whole pro- 
cess exasperating. 

I heard, in the back of my 
mind, the slow whisper of the 
music and I saw the beach-um- 
brellaed terrace where Elsie and 
I had danced. The esper was 
finding the range. 

Elsie? I formed the name in 
my mind. 

She was asleep, all right But 
her voice from far away, foggy 
yet real: Darling. 

In successsion, I formed the 
thoughts: I’m well. Fm lonesome. 
I love you. 

And her answers: Fm well, but 
tired. I love you, too. I want to 
see you . 

Three minutes went very fast. 

"ll^HAT had I accomplished? 

” Nothing, perhaps. Nothing, 
certainly, that could have been 
put on a progress report. I didn’t 
know why Elsie was tired, I 
didQj’t know what she had had for 
dinner or what the weather was 
in Zanzibar. I didn’t even have 
a phrase or a gesture or a look 
to treasure; nothing had been 
that clear. Esping is a form of 



communication, yes, but of emo- 
tions rather than concepts. One 
speaks with sighs instead of syl- 
lables, and I don’t know any an- 
swer to give to those who say 
you can get the same effect star- 
ing into the bubbles in your beer. 

For a moment, I had been 
with Elsie in my mind. I couldn’t 
touch her; I couldn’t hear her or 
see her, but she was there. Was 
that worth slightly more than six 
cents a second, tax included? 

It was worth anything in the 
world. 

I p>aid the girl at the desk 
dreamily and drifted out I was 
halfway across the street before I 
heard her calling after me. 

“Hey, Lieutenant! You forgot 
your hat.” I took it from her, 
blinking. She said: “I hope things 
work out for you and your wife.” 

I thanked her and caught a bus 
back along the palm-lined boule- 
vards. 

All the depression was gone. 
All right, I hadn’t touched Elsie 
— but I had been with her. How 
many times, after all, in our short 
married life together had I waked 
in the night and known, only 
known, that she was asleep be- 
side me? I didn’t have to wake 
her, or talk to her, or turn on 
the light and look at her; I knew 
she was there. 

I got off the bus at Lincoln 
Road, still dreaming. It was dark, 
or nearly, before I came to and 



SLAVE SHIP 



123 



realized I had walked far past 
my hotel and that I was hungry. 

I looked around for a place to 
eat, but I was in an area of solid 
brass. COMSOLANT was only a 
block away and the two nearest 
restaurants bore the discreet le- 
gend: Fla^ Officers Only. 

I turned around and walked 
back toward my own area. 

T WONDERED why it was so 

dark and then realized that 
Miami Beach, like Project Mako, 
was blacked out. But it seemed 
blacker than a blackout could ac- 
count for, and not in any under- 
standable way. 

The lights were there, hidden 
behind their canvas shields from 
the possible enemy eyes at sea. 
The narrow slits in the shields 
over the street lamps cast enough 
light on the pavement for me to 
see where my feet were going. 
The cars that moved along the 
boulevards had their marker 
lights, dim and downward - cast 
but clear. And yet I was finding 
it hard to get my bearings. 

Something was sawing at my 
mind. 

It was the hormone shots, I 
thought, with a feeling of relief. 
I was still a little sensitive, per- 
haps, from the esping. What I 
needed was a good meal and to 
sit down for a while. It would 
make me as good as new. 

But where was a restaurant? 

124 



Someone slid a burning pine 
splinter into the base of my neck. 
It hart! 

I must have yelled, because fig- 
ures came running toward me. I 
couldn’t see them very clearly, 
and not only because of the dark- 
ness, and I couldn’t quite heaf" 
what they said, because some- 
thing was whining and droning 
in my ears, or in my mind. 

There was another stab at the 
base of my head and one in my 
shoulders, like hot knives. I 
felt myself falling; something 
smacked across my face and I 
knew it was the pavement. But 
that pain was numbed, nothing 
compared to the fire stabbing 
into my neck and shoulders. 

Someone was tugging at my 
arm and roaring. I heard a police 
whistle and wondered why. And 
then I didn’t wonder anything at 
all. 

The world was black and silent. 
Even the pain was gone. 

V 

^fCTILL ALIVE, for God’s 
sake! Suppose we ought to 
let him sleep it off?” 

I blocked someone’s slapping 
hands away from my cheeks and 
opened one eye. 

Ringed around me were half 
a dozen faces, looking down — a 
couple of nurses, a doctor or two, 
and a j.g. with a thin black mus- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tache and an O.O.D. band on his 
arm. 

“Well,” said the Officer of the 
Deck, “welcome back.” 

I tasted something awful in my 
mouth. “Wha — happened?” 

The faces were grave. “You got 
burned.” 

Apparently being burned was 
no laughing matter. I groggily 
made sense of what they were 
telling me. 

Like the Air Force captain at 
the Boca Raton field, like the 
other mysterious victims I had 
heard whispers about, I had been 
burned. And it was true enough; 
they showed me a bright mirror 
above and I could see the bums. 
My shoulders, the base of my 
neck, a thin line down my back 
— they were all brilliant scarlet, 
like a bad sunburn, and they hurt. 

Something clicked in my fuzzy 
brain. “Oh,” I said, “the Glotch.” 

But they had never heard of 
“the Glotch.” Evidently the Boca 
Raton name for it was purely 
local, but the thing was the same, 
all right. They called it “getting 
burned.” The O.O.D., whose name 
was Barney Savidge, had heard 
it called “The Caodai horrors.” 
But it was all the same thing and 
all bad. 

“You’re a lucky kid,” said Lieu- 
tenant Savidge. “We picked you 
up and it looked like you were 
as dead as the rest of them. After 
all, only one out of a thous — ” 



“Savidge!” one of the medics 
said sharply. 

The O.O.D. looked quilty. 
“Sorry, sir. Ansnvay, Moeller, 
you’re lucky.” 

They wouldn’t tell me much; 
apparently the Glotch was as 
hush-hush in Miami as it was in 
Boca Raton. 

But it appeared I would live. 
They brought me coffee after 
they finished dressing my burns. 
I was in COMCARIB’s naval hos- 
pital and, although I had visions 
of being a celebrity for a day, the 
O.O.D. cut me down to size. 

“It comes and goes,” he said, 
looking apprehensively at the 
ship’s surgeon out of earshot across 
the room. “It comes and goes, 
some days a whole bunch of cas- 
ualties, some days none. Last 
night was one of the bad ones.” 

“You mean I wasn’t the only 
one?” 

“Hah! There were seven, Moel- 
ler — last I heard.” He stared at 
me thoughtfully. “The only dif- 
ference between you and the 
other six is, you’re alive.” 

It was a cheerful thought. 
“Well,” I said, “thanks for every- 
thing and I guess I’ll be getting 
along — ” 

“I guess you won’t,” he said 
flatly. “Maybe in the morning. 
They want to look you over — 
you’re supposed to be dead, you 
know. They want to find out how 
come you’re not” 



SLAVE SHIP 



125 



It wasn’t so bad. They kept 
taking my temperature for a 
while, and feeling my pulse, and 
talking to each other in what doc- 
tors use for English. But Savidge, 
who didn’t appear to be too over- 
worked as O.O.D., dropped in 
every few minutes and we got 
fairly well acquainted. Along 
about three in the morning, they 
decided I could go to sleep. 

So I did, but I wouldn’t say I 
slept well. 

T he hairy-bodied officer 

at COMSOLANT was in uni- 
form this time and he turned out 
to be a captain. “Moeller,” he 
said crisply, “I told you your 
stuff wasn’t ready yet. Are you 



trying to rush me? Sp>eak up!” 
“No, sir, but — 

“But go away, Moeller,” he 
said. “Remember the famous 
motto of the Navy: ‘Don’t call 
us; we’ll call you.’ You’re dis- 
missed.” And that was that. 

I wandered down to COMCA- 
RIB and rousted Barney Savidge 
out of bed. He was bleary-eyed 
on three hours sleep after a night 
as Officer of the Deck, but he 
began to wake up with the third 
cup of wardroom coffee. 

“I’ll tell you what we do,” he 
began to plan. “We’ll pick up a 
couple of Waafs from the train- 
ing center and run over to Tropi- 
cal Park for the afternoon and — ” 
“I’m married, Barney.” 




126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 








He stared at me. “What?” 

“I don’t want to pick up a 
couple of Waafs.” 

He scratched his head. “Well, 
we’ll go over to Tropical Park 
by ourselves and — ” 

I said: “Barney, could we look 
around the base here? I’ve been 
out on a cow — that is,” I cor- 
rected myself hurriedly, remem- 
bering those bright red Most Se- 
cret stamps on my travel orders, 
“I’ve been out of touch with the 
Navy. Let’s take a look at the 
ships.” 

All he said was: “It takes all 
kinds.” 

COMCARIB is only a satellite 
of COMSOLANT, but the Carib- 
bean fleet is big enough for any- 



body. There were forty men of 
war surfaced in Bisca3me Bay, 
destroyers and carriers and a 
couple of JVimitz-cla^ cruisers 
that brought a curious sensation 
to my throat 

“Busy out there,” I said, star- 
ing hungrily at the fighting ships 
nursing from the tankers. 

“It’s getting busier all the time, 
Logan,” Barney said soberly. “See 
that bucket beyond the break- 
water?” He was pointing at an 
ancient monitor, a harbor-defense 
craft with plenty of punch but no 
range to speak of. Work barges 
were lashed to its sides and weld- 
ers were slicing into a twisted, 
scarred mass of metal on its for- 
ward deck.

“Looks like it tangled with a 
can opener,” I said. 

“A Caodai can opener. That’s 
Hadley and it was down off the 
Keys when a Caodai sneak raid 
took a potshot at it. It got back; 
there were two last month that 
didn’t.” 

I said uneasily: “Barney, have 
things been hotting up while I 
was at sea? All this business of 
getting burned and sneak raids 
right off our coast — it sounds 
bad.” 

B arney shrugged morosely. 

“Who knows? There isn’t 
any war on.” 

“Come on,” I insisted. “What’s 
the score?” 

‘Who knows?” he repeated. 
“You can see for yourself, things 
are happening. Up until last 
year, COMCARIB had never lost 
a capital ship in coastal waters. 
Since then — well, never mind 
how many, but we’ve lost some. 
Are things getting worse all over 
or is it just local? I don’t know. 
We send out a squad of scout 
torpedoes three times a day and 
I guess we average twenty con- 
tacts a week. 

“By the time the big boys get 
to where the torpedoes have 
made a contact, there’s nothing 
there, usually. Sometimes not 
even the scout But you look in 
the papers and you find nothing 
about it of course. Once in a 



while, maybe, there’s a story 
about ‘Unidentified vessel sighted 
off Miami Beach’ — that’s when 
you can see them from the top- 
floor windows of the hotels. But 
that’s all.” 

He flicked his cigarette into 
the water and grinned at me. 
“Now do we go to Tropical 
Park?” 

So we went and I succeeded in 
losing forty-five dollars. It wasn’t 
hard — I just bet hunches. By 
the fourth race, the T/5 at the 
five-dollar window got to know 
me and shook his head sadly 
when I bought my tickets, but I 
didn’t mind much, because what 
I was thinking of was not horses 
and parimutuel betting but war 
and Elsie. 

I sat out the sixth race in a 
canteen imder the grandstand 
and read a newspaper. I could 
hear the crowd screaming and 
stamping overhead, but the news- 
paper thundered louder than 
they, if only you read between 
the lines. Eight-Year-Olds Face 
Student Draft. How long had we 
been putting school kids in imi- 
form? Had it started while I was 
on Spruance? The age limits had 
been lower and lower, that much 
I knew — but eight-year-olds? 

Caodais Protest Ankara Loot- 
ing, Threaten Reprisals Against 
Hostages. I read that one thor- 
oughly. There had been trouble 
at the Caodai legation in Turkey 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



VI 



and the Caodais appeared to 
think it was deliberately fo- 
mented. That much was simple 
enough, but the bit about hos- 
tages gave me a bad time. 

Because I couldn’t help re- 
membering that one of the hos- 
tages was no mere statistic, but 
the girl I had married. 

The nature of the trouble in 
Ankara was far from clear; some- 
times it seemed to me that there 
had been an arson attempt, some- 
times a mere hit-and-run bur- 
glary. It was sloppy reporting 
and I read the item over a dozen 
times before I concluded that it 
didn’t matter. If the Caodais were 
looking for a pretext to take their 
temper out on the hostages, any- 
thing at all would serve. 

I found Barney in the -crowd, 
right where I’d left him, and told 
him my burns were bothering 
me. It was true enough, at that 
— my whole neck was stiffening 
up. But what was bothering me 
most of all was life itself. I ar- 
ranged to meet him again and 
caught the bus back to my hotel, 
so lost in my own ugly thoughts 
that I didn’t pay any attention 
to the desk clerk’s expression. 

But what he handed me along 
with my room key jolted me out 
of my reverie. It was a mailgram 
from Project Mako: LEAVE 

CANCELED. RETURN PRO- 
JECT IMMEDIATELY. LINE- 
BACK 



K EDRICK fussed over me like 
a furious kitten: .“Curse it, 
Moeller, don’t you know the first 
thing about military security? 
You’ve got your head crammed 
full of the top-ciassified informa- 
tion in the country — and you 
have to blather it all over the 
world with an esper!" 

I swallowed and said nothing 
at all. In truth, I had almost 
forgotten going to the esper; the 
attack on the beach had just 
about wiped it out of my mind. 

“Answer me!” demanded Ked- 
rick. 

I hadn’t heard the question, 
but I could guess. ‘Tm sorry, 
sir,” I said. 

“Sorry!” Kedrick seemed to in- 
flate with pent-up irritation. “If 
you’re sorry now, what will you 
be when a court-martial gets hold 
of you?” 

“But I — I didn’t say any- 
thing, sir. I just sort of, well, 
wanted to know how my wife 
was. You don’t talk when you 
esp. You just — ” 

“Knock it off,” ordered Ked- 
rick explosively. “You can tell 
all that to Commander Lineback. 
I can assure you, though, that he 
takes a dim view of you right 
at the moment.” 

“Yes, sir.” I thought a moment 
and added: “Is that why I was 
recalled?” 



SLAVE SHIP 



129 



“No.” Kedrick shifted gears 
into savage irony. “You were re- 
called because the project would 
like you to do a little work for a 
change. New equipment and new 
officers are in. We’re going to 
start to roll and you’ve got to 
attend a briefing at oh-eight-hun- 
dred tomorrow. As a matter of 
fact, Moeller, we didn’t find out 
about your crazy trick with the 
esper until a mailgram came in 
from COMCARIB half an hour 
ago. There was a censor’s gig- 
sheet on you and the commander 
hit the roof.” 

That was improbable, I 
thought, remembering Lineback. 
I appeared to be dismissed, so 
I started a rather stiff-armed 
salute. It attracted Kedrick’s at- 
tention. 

“What the devil’s the matter 
with your neck?” he demanded. 

I touched the bandages. “What 
you call the Glotch, sir,” I said, 
and told him my adventure. It 
took a lot of passion out of him. 
He was staring pensively at noth- 
ing when I finished. 

“Is that all, sir?” I asked posi- 
tively, after a moment. 

‘What?” He roused himself. 
“Oh, I guess so, Moeller. This 
is a crazy business.” 

“Yes, sir,” I agreed. 

He seemed very tired all of a 
sudden. “You’re dismissed. Go 
pop a couple with your girl 
and — ” 



“I don’t have a girl, sir,” I said. 

“Well, take a couple of drinks 
and get a night’s sleep.” He 
shook his head wearily. “Trou- 
ble! The Glotch and the stock- 
ade getting set to explode and 
wet-nursed jaygees spilling their 
guts with espers — ” He was 
talking to himself, not me. 

I saluted and hit the sack. 
I hadn’t fully understood the re- 
ference to the stockade, but I 
didn’t let worry keep me awake. 
I dreamed very happily of 
Elsie until the messman tapped 
on my door at 0700. 

T here were fifteen of us 
officers at the briefing, six of 
them brand-new, arrived on the 
morning plane. Commander 
Lineback spoke only long enough 
to introduce a — civilian! 

We all looked at him with 
considerable interest. His name 
was Schwende and he was at 
least fihy — well over the com- 
pulsory military training age, of 
course. But he was a civilian, 
and he was out of uniform, and 
Lineback referred to him as 
“doctor.” He was quick and con- 
cise and he told us, at long last, 
what all of us were doing at 
Project Mako. 

We are going to do research 
in animal communication. 

There wasn’t anything new 
about that, but we were going to 
add some new wrinkles. Dairy 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



farmers had given orders to 
their cows for decades. But we 
were going beyond cows and 
horses and pigs, beyond the or- 
der to lay off the cash crop and 
the one to return to the barn 
for milking. We were going to 
talk to them. 

“You’ll make guesses,” said 
the doctor — of animal hus- 
bandry, not medicine. “That’s 
your privilege. Guess your heads 
off about what the Navy’s going 
to do with animals. But keep 
your guesses to yourself.” 

And that was the end of that, 
barring handing out individual 
assignments. Mine was to run a 
computer. 

We were dismissed and the 
new draft of officers rejxjrted to 
the dayroom to be assigned to 
quarters. All of the new ones 
were ensigns and j.g.s, except for 
the Russian. He was some kind 
of senior lieutenant, but just 
what that amounted to, I cannot 
say. It didn’t matter in terms of 
command relationship, of course, 
because as a co-belligerent he 
was present only as a military ob- 
server. He was Red Army, not 
Navy, but he wore our naval un- 
dress whites, with only the Rus- 
sian shoulder-boards to mark his 
rank. 

And he was quartered with me. 

A room to myself had been too 
good to last. I showed him to 
our room with silent regrets for 



the loss of my solitude. In hesi- 
tant but good English, he said: 
“Is very nice, Lieutenant Which 
of the beds is yours?” 

I offered him his choice, but he 
insisted on not disturbing my ar- 
rangements. “Both of them are 
splendid,” he declared judiciously, 
and then he smiled. It was a good 
smile; with it, he came to rigid 
attention. “Timiyazev, Semyon 
Ilyitch,” he proclaimed. “Please 
to call me Semyon.” 

T HELPED HIM unpack and 

we made ourselves acquainted. 
He knew more about Project 
Mako than I had before the brief- 
ing, but nothing that was very 
informative. He had been thor- 
oughly briefed by his govem- 
ment-in-exile at their tiny lega- 
tion in Washington, just next to 
the dome of the United Nations 
building. 

He said: “They were very glad 
to be able to send me to this 
place. We have not so very many 
officers in the Free Russian 
Forces who are versed in animal 
psychology, do you see? Much 
less one who is the son of a col- 
league of Pavlov’s.” 

“I didn’t know it ran in the 
blood.” 

He looked at me appraisingly, 
then chuckled. “Oh, it does not 
Surely not. But my mother was 
also my teacher. She was un- 
happy when my opportunity 



SLAVE SHIP 



131 



came to attend the Suvorov Aca- 
demy. She would have preferred, 
you see, a scientific life for me. 
But in a world of war, one is 
best as a soldier. And if one must 
be a soldier, why not attend the 
Academy and have perhaps the 
prospect of becoming a general?” 
He added pensively, “That was 
some years ago, of course, before 
the Orientals occupied us. Now 
— perhaps my mother knew 
best.” 

I made my excuses after a lit- 
tle while. Semyon made me a 
bit uncomfortable. 

I know that the Russian busi- 
ness is all over and done with, 
and you don’t hold a grudge 
against somebody who’s down. 
And, in a way, it’s our fault that 
the Russians are in the kind of 
shape they're in. If we hadn’t pul- 
verized them so hard in the Short 
War, they wouldn’t have been so 
soft a touch ten years later for 
the Caodais coming up through 
Mongolia. 

And if they had been able to 
hold on for a while then, long 
enough for us to get off the dime, 
the Caodais might have been 
stopped in their tracks right 
there, the way Hitler could have 
been at the Sudetenland. And 
universal conscription might not 
have been necessary, and Elsie 
might not have been so many 
thousand miles away . 

And if wishes were horses, beg- 



gars would own the winners at 
Tropical Park. 



^f'T'AKE A LOOK, Lieuten- 
ant.” Oswiak took his hands 
off the controls to point. 

I clutched the sides of the ’cop- 
ter seat and looked. “I never saw 
those buildings before.” 

“Sure you didn’t,” he agreed. 
“They wasn’t any buildings there 
last week. The Seabees come in 
the day you took off for Miami, 
and more fuss and commotion 
you never heard in your life. But 
they got them up.” He brought 
us down gently between two of 
the buildings we were talking 
about — three-story prefabs with 
the workmen still laying pnjwer 
lines around them. “Looks like 
we’re getting busy, hey. Lieuten- 
ant?” he said with satisfaction. 

It did indeed. Counting a cou- 
ple of p>ermanent buildings that 
had been standing idle, waiting 
for equipment, there were a good 
hundred thousand square feet of 
space in the new colony. A chunk 
of one floor in one of the prefabs 
was all mine. It was up to me 
to supervise the installation of 
my computers and get ready to 
go to work. 

The computers were the equal 
of anything I had had to work 
with at I.B.M., back in the old 
Civilian days. I looked at them 
and swallowed. Putting them in 
was a job, but I had a good crew 



1?2 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and the job was completed by 
bedtime. The night shift came 
on to test connections as I left. 
I stopped by my new roommate’s 
quarters to see if he wanted a lift 
back to the B.O.Q. 

He didn’t. It was well on to 
midnight, but he was busy doing 
something with a collie. 

From the door, I heard a click- 
ing sound, like one of those tin 
gadgets from childhood called 
crickets. I looked and that was 
what it was — formed tin body, 
hardened, cupped tin plate fitted 
into it. 

“What’s doing?” I demanded. 

Semyon looked up angrily. 
“Hush, Logan!” he ordered sev- 
erely. “New dog, I must finish this 
trial. Stay right there where you 
are!” 

The dog looked at me plead- 
ingly. It was clearly confused. 
Its tongue was hanging, it was 
panting, its slightly raised foreleg 
was quivering. Semyon didn’t say 
another word. We all waited and 
the dog got tired first. 

It started toward me, looked 
at Semyon, hesitated, stopped. 
Semyon was as silent as old Sta- 
lin in his tomb. The dog turned 
tentatively to one side and click 
went the cricket in Semyon’s fin- 
gers. 

The dog walked slowly to 
a straight-backed chair. Click. 
The dog touched the chair with 
its nose. Click, click. 



Y es, I WAS puzzled. Semyon 
had called it a “trial,” but all 
he was doing was clicking his 
little cricket. He didn’t say a 
word; he hardly moved. 

The dog was as puzzled as I, 
which was some consolation. It 
stopped and looked at Semyon. 
Semyon, blue eyes serene under 
his pale brows, looked calmly 
back. The dog took a hesitant 
step away from the chair and 
paused, waiting for a reaction. 
Silence. 

The dog whined worriedly and 
returned to the chair. Click went 
Semyon’s cricket. The dog placed 
its forepaws on the seat. Click, 
click. The dog leaped into the 
seat and curled up, tail wagging 
madly. Click, click, click and 
then Semyon, grinning broadly, 
said: 

“Fine dog. Oh, excellent dog! 
You may come in now, please, 
Logan.” He walked over to the 
dog, talking to it in Russian, and 
scratched enthusiastically behind 
its ears. 

“What the devil is it?” I de- 
manded. “Were you sending 
Morse code?” 

He beamed. “Not precisely the 
Morse, you understand, but a 
code. We were talking, the dog 
and I.” 

“Some Russian invention?” 

He shrugged modestly. “Cer- 
tainly a Russian invention. My 
own mother invented it herself; 



SLAVE SHtP 



133 



you will find it described in Great 
Russian Encyclopedia. Of 
course,” he added, to be fair, “she 
was assisted in inventing it by a 
man named Skinner in America, 
who invented it also, some years 
earlier. But my mother invented 
it in Russia, you see.” 

“Tell me,” I invited. 

Semyon was delighted to ex- 
plain, but he was far from clear. 
It was a way of communicating 
with animals, only the animals 
couldn’t talk back. It was a way 
of getting a dog to do what you 
wished, yet it wasn’t training. 

“Is it the same thing Lineback 
uses for cows?” 

“No, no!” he said. “Radically 
different, Logan!” 

“Different how?” 

C EM YON gave me a queer 
look. I could see he was won- 
dering how anyone so stupid had 
been assigned to Project Mako, 
but he was too polite to say so. 

He said only: “You have heard 
the cattle language. It is only a 
matter of listening to the sounds 
the beasts make — we will dis- 
miss, for the moment, the visual 
components. One discovers how 
one beast informs another that 
there is, shall we say, a patch of 
clover here or a stinging nettle 
there. Once you have learned the, 
shall we call it, ox-tongue — ” he 
grinned at me — “you say it back 
to the beast. 

134 



“You make a stinging-nettle 
bleat for danger and pain; you 
say it to the beast, and you show 
him, perhaps, a clump of mari- 
golds. Then perhaps he does not 
eat the marigolds. Of course, he 
perhaps slips some times, for he 
is quite stupid. He may take a 
nibble to see for himself. 'Then 
you beat him, and make the sting- 
ing-nettle bleat again, and he 
learns. Oh, he learns, surely; it 
is question of time and repeti- 
tion.” 

He frowned at me and said ar- 
gumentatively: “Is training, you 
see? The language in that meth- 
od is only to expedite the train- 
mg. 

“I see. And what you were 
doing?” 

“It is language” He smiled ab- 
ruptly. “But I admit, Logan, it is 
a very tiny language. One word: 
‘Yes.’ My dog here, Josip; if he 
does as I wish, I say ‘yes’ to him. 
If he does what I do not wish, 
I say nothing at all, and he un- 
derstands ‘no.’ I snap this thing 
for yes; I do nothing for no. A 
very simple language, isn’t it?” 

“Too simple. How can it 
work?” 

He shrugged. “See for your- 
self. What would you have Josip 
do?” 

“Do?” 

“Set a task for him, Logan. 
We shall see.” I hesitated, and he 
flared up: “You think it is no 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



language, yes? I see. You think 
it is some kind of trick or game, 
like trained-dog acts in the fair. 
But see for yourself, Logan — 
give me an order and I will trans- 
late. Would you perhaps care 
to have Josip sit in your lap? 
Push the door you left ajar closed 
with his nose? Fetch you a book 
from the shelf?” 

F SAID awkwardly: “I’ve seen 
trained dogs do some astonish- 
ing things — ” 

“Not trained!” he almost 
screamed. “Is absolutely un- 
trained, this dog! Except for only 
one hour this afternoon, when I 
taught him the language. Nothing 
else. Is not training, Logan, you 
must understand that!” He cast 
about the room agitatedly. “No 
discussion!” he said peremptorily. 
“Look here, I choose a task. You 
see the cardboard cup on the 
floor? Once it had coffee in it. 
I drank the coffee; I forgot the 
cup. I shall require Josip to pick 
it up and put it in the waste- 
basket. Neatness is important, is 
it not? Even for a dog.” 

“I had a Scotty who carried 
newspapers — ” 

“Logan! I shall stand behind 
this folding screen, peeping at 
him with only my eyes. I shall 
say nothing, except in our tiny 
language. One word, remember! 
No, no — no discusion, only 
watch.” 



He huffed and went behind the 
screen, the dog watching him 
worriedly. 

It was a sad little spectacle, in 
a way. My S3mnpathies were all 
with the dog. He knew some- 
thing was expected of him, but 
he clearly did not know what. 
There was silence from Semyon 
behind the screen. Then the dog 
took a tentative step toward 
Semyon. Silence still. The dog, 
forlorn, took a step away. Click 
from Semyon. 

The dog brightened and, with 
assurance, took several more 
steps. Click, click, click and then 
the clicking stopped. The dog 
had veered away from the direc- 
tion of the paper cup. 

J OSIP was beginning to get the 
hang of it. He lolled his tongue 
worriedly for only a second, then 
tried another direction, at ran- 
dom. Silence. Then another, and 
this time it was straight for the 
cup. Click, click until the dog 
was standing right at the cup, 
touching it with his nose. 

It might have taken three or 
four minutes in all, but, guided 
by Semyon’s cricket-noises, the 
dog unarguably did exactly v'hat 
Semyon had promised. He pushed 
the cup, touched it with his paw, 
rolled it with his nose. Eventually 
he picked it up, and eventually 
he carried it to the waste- 
basket. Like Shannon’s mechan- 



SLAVE SHIP 



135 



ical mouse, he made random mo- 
tions until he fovmd one that paid 
off (with a click) and continued 
with it purposefully until the pay- 
off stopped. 

It all went quite rapidly. The 
cup went into the wastebasket 
and Semyon came gleefully from 
behind the screen. 

“Ah, Logan?” he asked. “Train- 
ing? Or language?” I was getting 
sleepy. I left him and looked in 
on the last stages of checking my 
digital computers. 

Well, I am no more stupid than 
most, but Man’s mind is divided 
into compartments, leakproof and 
thought-tight. I had been polite 
with Semyon, but I had not been 
convinced. 

Set aside the question of what 
it all had to do with the Navy 
or the Caodais — that was a sep- 
arate problem. On its own merits, 
what Semyon was doing was in- 
teresting enough. And p>erhaps it 
was even important, in some way. 
But to call it language? Ridicu- 
lous. I had at least a nodding 
acquaintance ■ with the theory of 
language. Language is a supple 
and evocative thing; how could 
you dignify a one-word vocabu- 
lary by that term? Imagine com- 
pressing information, any quan- 
tity whatsoever of information, 
into a simple yes-and-no code . 

Thinking which, I checked the 
installation of my digital com- 
puters, capable of infinite subtle 



operations, packed with countless 
bits of knowledge and instruction. 

All of it was transcribed, sum- 
marized and digested into what 
the mathematicians call the 
binary system, and reproduced in 
the computers by the off-or-on 
status of electronic cells. 

Binary — yes or no — off 
or on. 

VII 

M aybe I was stupid. But you 
have to admit that the idea 
of binary language is hard to 
take. 

Animals, after all, are not elec- 
tronic computers. They are flesh 
and blood like ourselves. I would 
have thought of talking to ani- 
mals in a mathematical code 
about as soon as I would have 
thought of talking to my RAG- 
NAROK in German. 

And then I found out that, way 
back in the ’fifties, people had 
begun to do just that. I poked 
through the briefing documents 
in the project library imtil I 
found a resume of some trials 
that had taken place long ago, in 
England, on a computer called 
APEXC — heaven knows why. 
They set the computer the prob- 
lem of translating German into 
English. The computer, no doubt, 
clicked and hummed and blew a 
couple of fuses, and then settled 
down to the job of squeezing the 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sense of one language into the 
forms of another. 

The resume didn’t say just how 
well APEXC made out, but there 
were hints. In the first place, 
some mere human had to give 
APEXC a hand in the clinches — 
what they called post-editing, 
meaning the choice, from context, 
of several possible translations 
for a single word. But it worked. 

So I read farther — on animal 
communication, this time. I found 
Semyon’s mother’s “invention” in 
the literature — also way back 
in the early ’fifties. I found sam- 
ple vocabularies for cow, for dog, 
even for rabbit and duck. 

Some of the “words” were kind 
of interesting. For crow, a B-na- 
tural whole note, two staccato 
A-sharp quarter notes and a scat- 
tering of grace notes. Translation : 
“Beat it, there’s an eagle coming.” 
Crow was one of the simpler vo- 
cabularies, only about fifty iden- 
tified words; but it was astonish- 
ing what corvus conveyed to his 
friends with a few very simple 
caws. 

And some of the beasts, nearly 
mute, got considerable meaning 
across without any sound at all. 
Take the duck’s train-switching 
wiggle of the tail feathers, for 
instance. Translation: “I love 
very much, honey, let’s get mar- 
ried.” 

I suspected, at about that 
point, that some of the early re- 



searchers were carried away by 
their sense of humor. 

“Langriage?” I complained to 
Semyon in our quarters, while I 
was reading the briefing books 
and he was playing something he 
called a balalaika. “How can they 
call that language? If my mouth 
waters, that means I want to eat 
— but is mouth-watering a word? 
It’s only a reflex action, Semyon!” 

He didn’t miss a chord. “Is 
better, Logan, that you consider 
instead the analogy of onoma- 
topoeia!” 

Well, that stopped me — until 
I looked it up — and then it 
stopped me in a different way. 
Onomatopjoeia : the formation of 
words from instinctive or mime- 
tic sounds, thought by some to be 
the essential origin of all lan- 
guage. 

Well, suppose the supple Eng- 
lish language really was nothing 
but a refined and codified collec- 
tion of grunts and yelps and 
wheezes . 

And suppx>se that animal barks 
and posturings were language as 
well . 

What the devil did the Navy 
want of me, anjway? 

TT WAS black night; the stars 
were bright — and the Project 
Mako alarm bell was ringing 
General Quarters. 

I leapod out of bed like a grig 
on a griddle. It was the first GQ 



SLAVE SHIP

I’d heard since I left Spruance, 
but the old habits didn’t die. Gen- 
eral Quarters meant get to your 
combat stations now. I was into 
my pants and on my way out the 
door before the springs on my 
bed stopped vibrating. 

The only thing was — what 
combat stations? 

By the time I was awake 
enough to ask myself that, I found 
that other people had the same 
question. Every officer on the 
Project was milling around the 
corridors, yelling at each other in 
confusion. Kedrick’s tirmy voice 
over the loud-hailer straightened 
us out, though. It blared: “All of- 
ficers to the wardroom! On the 
double! All officers to the ward- 
room! On the double!” 

W E pushed into the wardroom 
like the Golden Horde 
through Hungary— and just as un- 
kempt. The mess attendants 
showed up, blinking and rubbing 
their eyes. Kedrick, standing on 
a table with a strange Army 
major next to him, snapped: “Cof- 
fee, you men! Get the lead out! 
We’re pulling out of here in 
twenty minutes.” 

As the mess attendants were 
disapp>earing, he barked: “Shut 
up, everybody! Keep it down! 
The Cow-dyes are busting out of 
the stockade and we’re going to 
shove ’em back in. Major Lan- 
sing will explain.” 



The exec bobbed his plump 
chin at the strange Army officer, 
who growled: “Now you know as 
much as I do, except for details. 
Fm security officer at Eighth 
Group, up the beach. About an 
hour ago, there was some ship-to- 
shore shelling, mostly flares and 
noisemakers, and then the damn 
Cow-dyes began boiling up. They 
swamped the guards, took our 
headquarters building, knocked 
out our radio, and kept on going. 
Fve got six personnel-carrying 
’copters outside — ” I recognized 
then the fluttering rumble that 
had been subconsciously bother- 
ing me — “and you’re the near- 
est effectives.” 

He glanced at us wryly, but 
let it go at that “Your comman- 
der is already on his way there. 
Lieutenant Kedrick and I will 
command two columns to relieve 
the guards. If there are any 
guards left to relieve by the time 
we get there.” 

He moved aside as the mess- 
men came in with the first pots 
of coffee. 

“I’m sorry,” he added, “to be 
going out of channels this way, 
but war is hell.” He glanced at 
his watch. “We’re taking off in 
five minutes. You want coffee, 
drink it. You want more clothes, 
go get them. Weapons will be is- 
sued at the ’copters.” 

And that was that. It was like 
being in the Navy again.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



S EMYON appeared toward the 
end of the major’s little talk, 
sleepy-eyed and wobbly, but he 
didn’t have any trouble pulling 
himself together when he heard 
what the man had to say. He 
shouldered his way to me. 

“Ah, Logan!” he exulted. “We 
shoot some Orientals, I hop>e. It 
will give me pleasure. Only — ” 
he looked oddly shy — “a favor, 
Logan?” 

I burned my lips on the coffee. 
I managed to say: “What favor?” 
“Josip. Who knows what your 
n Bureau of Supply will do with 
him if I end up in some un- 
marked grave? I do not suppose 
that a dog is a standard article 
to be furnished to ships and shore 
installations. Will you — ” 

I stared at him. “Sure,” I man- 
aged to promise. 

It was just cracking daylight 
as we came fluttering down into 
the mangroves. There was no 
sign of the ship-to-shore firing the 
major had talked about, but out 
over the pearl-skied Atlantic I 
could see the lights of himter 
’copters stabbing at the waves. If 
there were Caodai vessels out 
there, they would be wisest not 
to surface. It would be some time 
before marine vessels with any 
range could reach the scene, but 
the ’copters were there and I 
imagined I could see the skitter- 
ing hydrofoils on the surface. 
“Ssst!” hissed Semyon sharply 



as we banked and dipped. “Over 
there, Logan! Like beetles in 
barn dung!” 

“What? What?" I was a little 
jumpy, I guess. 

“The Orientals,” gloated Sem- 
yon. And then, with an abrupt 
change of pace, utter dejection: 
“The fools! The fools! Why do 
we not hit them from above, eh? 
Bomb them, napalm them, shoot 
them — ” 

“Thejr’re prisoners, Semyon!” 
I said, shocked. 

“A prisoner escaped is scarcely 
a prisoner, my friend. What is 
better — to shoot them from 
above, where they cah scarcely 
do us much harm, or to sit in the 
bushes below and wait for them 
to come?” 

I said uneasily: ‘The majoi 
looks like he knows what he’s 
doing, Semyon.” 

He shrugged a large Russian 
shrug and that was all. But he 
carefully checked the clips on his 
T-gun. 

The ’copters came down in a 
clearing and the major jumped 
on a stump to dispose us. ‘They’re 
moving slow,” he bellowed, “but 
they’re moving. Soon as you see 
anything, shoot it! They’ve got 
some guns, captured from the 
guards. I don’t know how many 
or whether this lot has them. 
There’s upward of five thousand 
of them nmning around, so you’ll 
have plenty of targets. Moeller!” 



SLAVE SHIP 



139 



I jumped. Of all things I might 
have expected, being called out 
by name just then wasn’t one of 
them. 

“Front and center, Moeller,” 



lashed to a Churchill dock, bob- 
bing harmlessly in the gentle 
morning swell. 

She said bitterly: “Half our 
complement on leave — under- 




bawled the major. “The rest of 
you disperse and take cover.” 

OUT IT HAD an explanation. 

I saluted the major with 
more snap than I’d been able to 
put into a salute for weeks. He 
clipped: “Moeller? You the one 
checked out on a scout torp?” 
“Checked out?” I started to 
blaze, but this wasn’t the time for 
it. I said briskly: “Better than 
eight hundred hours in combat 
sweeps, with a confirmed — ” 
“Sure,” he said, unimpressed 
and unheeding. He jerked a 
thumb and I found myself trudg- 
ing through the mangrove swamp 
with a female naval ensign, to- 
ward the shore. 

We looked at three scout torps 



staffed to begin with — the filthy 
swine!” She didn’t make clear 
whether the “swine” were COM- 
CARIB or the Caodais, but it 
was perfectly plear that she, as 
temporary exec officer while the 
male strength of the torpedo- 
squadron complement was man- 
ning the other torps, was request- 
ing me to take one of the idle 
scouts out on a sweep. 

She didn’t have to ask me 
twice. 

I slid out on the surface and 
two hundred yards from shore 
checked the sealer telltales, flood- 
ed the negative buoyancy tanks 
and tipped the diving vanes. I 
leveled off at thirty meters — 
plenty deep for the continental 
shelf.

guided aerial torpedoes mbstly — 
and that meant at least a few 
Caodai vessels somewhere within 
range. 

Of course, “range” was any- 



■ <<

My search pattern was clipped 
to the board over my scanning 
port. I flexed the vanes a couple 
of times to get the feel of the 
torp; it was good to be home 
again. All these scouts came off 
the same assembly lines and were 
made out of the same inter- 
changeable parts, but it is aston- 
ishing how much the feel can 
differ between craft. I set the 
auto-pilot for the first leg of the 
sweep, triggered the sonars, and 
I was off. 

Back to Spnxance! I felt like a 
fighting man. And there was 
some chance that I might see 
some action. The girl ensign had 
filled me in a little bit on the way 
down to the beach. There really 
had been ship-to-shore firing — 



thing up to 12,000 miles, and the 
only reason it wasn’t more is that 
you can’t get farther than 12,000 
miles away from anjrwhere and 
still be on Earth. But she thought, 
though she wasn’t clear why, that 
they were pretty close inshore. 






■V3 



T T WAS an exciting prospect. ’I 
I tasted the implications of it 
thoughtfully. Both sides in the 
cold war were being pretty meti- 
culous about respecting the con- 
tinental masses belonging to the 
other side. You couldn’t say as 
much for islands, and naturally 
Europe was respected by no one 
at all, being a selected jousting 
field. But even guided-missile at- 
tack was very rare. I wondered 
what on the Florida coast made 



SLAVE SHIP 



141 




the Caodais mad enough to start 
shooting. 

The blowoff, naturally, would 
be if they attempted to make a 
landing. 

I remembered what Kedrick 
had said about expecting trouble 
from the stockade. The girl had 
talked as if everyone knew the 
prisoners were seething for weeks 
past. 

How in blazes, I demanded 
■ of myself, could you be expected 
to know what was going on when 
security kept everybod 3 r’s mouth 
shut? 

Was it fair to drag me out 
of bed when — 

Two things stopped that train 
of thought. One was the faintly 
shamefaced realization that I was 
furiously enjoying every minute 
of it. 

The secohd was the sonar 
sighting bell loud in my ear. I 
read the telltales fast: It wasn’t 
a whale or a clump of weed. The 
microphones had picked up an- 
other sonar. And the IFF filters 
had spotted it instantly as an 
enemy. 

Contact! 

I hit the TBS button — and 
pra\ ;d there was someone within 
ran^'.- to hear: “Unidentified ob- 
ject, presumed Caodai, sighted at 
Grid Eight Eighty-Baker-Forty- 
Two— ■’ I read my coordinates 
off the autolog. “Object bearing 
fifty-five degrees from present po- 



sition, range extreme, size un- 
known.” 

That was it. 11 the sonar com- 
municator got as far as someone 
who could hear — and if the un- 
derstaffed, overworked squadron 
complement could spare a pair 
of ears to listen — then I might 
get reinforcements, possibly even 
in time to help. 

Until then, it was up to me. 

'C'EEDING the coal to the 
screws, I came about, tripping 
the safeties on the bow tubes. I 
had four tiny homing missiles to 
squander. Any one of them, 
small as they were, would prob- 
ably do the trick if they con- 
nected with anything smaller 
than a cruiser. 

And they would do their best 
to connect; their seeker fuses 
would tune in on the sound of 
the enemy screws, the tempera- 
ture of the enemy hull, the mag- 
netic deflection of the enemy 
steel, all at once. And if one bear- 
ing differed from the other two, 
they would reject that one. They 
would do their best. 

But of course the Caodais 
would be doing their best. Their 
noisemakers would be clattering 
up the water at acoustic-focal 
points hundreds of yards away. 
Their “curtain” ports would be 
dropping thermal flares. Their 
counter-magnet generators would 
be generating and killing magne- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tic fields stem and stem by un- 
predictable turns. 

Still — I had four missiles. One 
would be enough. 

I was closing on them at maxi- 
mum speed, trying hard to read 
the indications in the sonar. A 
little bright pip of light doesn’t 
tell you much, but it got bigger 
and brighter, and it began to look 
like something a lot bigger than 
me. 

All of a sudden, I was thinking 
of Elsie, fantastic thoughts: Sup- 
pose this Caodai, whatever he 
was, hit me; and suppose I got 
free and swam to the surface; and 
suppose they picked me up as a 
prisoner; and suppose they in- 
terned me; and suppose, just sup- 
pose, that I wound up on Zanzi- 
bar . 

But then I had no time for fan- 
tasies. 

The big, bright splotch in 
the sonar plate shimmered and 
spattered into a cluster of dots. 
For a moment, they wavered and 
tried to converge again — but it 
was a cluster, all right. 

One, two, three — I coimted, 
and counted again. 

But the count didn’t make 
much difference. 

I had four missiles, sure. And 
there were at least eight enemy 
craft!

SLAVE SHIP 



143 




FORECAST 

Like the second oct of a thoroughly exciting ploy, next month's installment of Frederik 
Pohi's SLAVE SHIP extracts every bit of nerve-jangling suspense from the themes in the 
first installment. Why should the Navy put a big-ship man on a dairy farm? What do 
cows hove to do with the Cow-dye enemy? The Glotch — that hideous burning death 
which strikes from nowhere — what is it and how does the enemy pick and smite victims? 
Con Moeller get back to sea, where at least he stands on infinitesimal chance of reaching 
his imprisoned wife on Zanzibar? And if this isn't a war, why are millions of men being 
killed everywhere but in the hostile countries? In other words, you may find serials that 
will pin you to your seat just as hard as SLAVE SHIP does — but any harder should be 
punishable by lawl 

Prepare yourself to meet SWENSON, DISPATCHER in a trickster of a novelet by R. 
DeWitt Miller ... for only a trickster of a novelet could hold anyone os deviously 
straightforward (or should it be straightforwardly devious?) as Swenson. Taken separately, 
Swenson's principal qualities aren't sins — he drinks beer and he dispatches spaceships. 
But what he does to competing lines is a caution!
