HELP US KEEP THE 
THINGS WORTH KEEPING 



It’s good to be a boy, exploring the 
wide world, soaking up wonderful 
new sounds and sights everywhere 
you go. And if the world’s a peaceful 
place, it’s good to grow up, too, and 
become a man. 

But will the world stay peaceful? 
That depends on whether we can keep 
the peace. Peace costs money. 

Money for military strength and 



for science. And money saved by 
individuals to help keep our economy 
strong. 

Your Savings Bonds make you a 
Partner in strengthening America’s 
Peace Power. 

The Bonds you buy will earn good 
interest for you. But the most im- 
portant thing they earn is peace. 

Are you buying enough?

iCTT is rather unusual,” Mag- 

Anan said^ “to assign an of- 
ficer of your rank to courier 
duty, but this is an unusual 
mission.” 

Retief sat relaxed and said 
nothing. Just before the si- 
lence grew awkward, Magnan 
went on. 

“There are four planets in 
the group,” he said. “Two 
double planets, all rather close 
to an unimportant star listed 
as DRI-G 33987. They’re 
called Jorgensen’s Worlds, 
and in themselves are of no 
importance whatever. How- 
ever, they lie deep in the sec- 
tor into which the Soetti have 
been penetrating. 

“Now — ” Magnan leaned 
forward and lowered his voice 
— “we have learned that the 



Soetti plan a bold step for- 
ward. Since they Ve met no op- 
position so far in their infil- 
tration of Terrestrial space, 
they intend to seize Jorgen- 
sen’s Worlds by force.” 

Magnan leaned back, wait- 
ing for Retief’s reaction. Re- 
tief drew carefully on his 
cigar and looked at Magnan. 
Magnan frowned. 

“This is open aggression, 
Retief,” he said, “in case I 
haven’t made myself clear. 
Aggression on Terrestrial-oc- 
cupied territory by an alien 
species. Obviously, we can’t 
allow it.” 

Magnan drew a large folder 
from his desk. 

“A show of resistance at 
this point is necessary. Unfor- 
tunately, Jorgensen’s Worlds

are technologically undevel- 
oped areas. They’re farmers or 
traders. Their industry is lim- 
ited to a minor role in their 
economy — enough to support 
the merchant fleet, no more. 
The war potential, by conven- 
tional standards, is nil.” 

Magnan tapped the folder 
before him. 

‘T have here,” he said sol- 
emnly, “information which 
will change that picture com- 
pletely.” He leaned back and 
blinked at Retief. 

a A LL right, Mr. Council- 
/^lor,” Retief said. “I’ll 
play along; what’s in the fold- 
er?” 

Magnan spread his fingers, 
folded one down. 

“First,” he said. “The Soetti 
War Plan — in detail. We were 
fortunate enough to make con- 
tact with a defector from a 
party of renegade Terrestrials 
who’ve been advising the So- 
etti.” He folded another fin- 
ger. “Next, a battle plan for 
the Jorgensen’s people, 
worked out by the Theory 
group.” He wrestled a third 
finger down. “Lastly; an Ut- 
ter Top Secret schematic for 
conversion of a standard anti- 
acceleration field into a po- 
tent weapon — a development 
our systems people have been 
holding in reserve for just 
such a situation.” 

“Is that all?” Retief said. 
“You’ve still got two fingers 
sticking up.” 

Magnan looked at the fin- 
gers and put them away. 

THE FROZEN PLANET 



“This is no occasion for 
flippancy, Retief. In the 
wrong hands, this information 
could be catastrophic. You’ll 
memorize it before you leave 
this building.” 

“I’ll carry it, sealed,” Retief 
said. “That way nobody can 
sweat it out of me.” 

Magnan started to shake his 
head. 

“Well,” he said. “If it’s 
trapped for destruction, I 
suppose — ” 

“I’ve heard of these Jorgen- 
sen’s Worlds,” Retief said. “I 
remember an agent, a big 
blond fellow, very quick on 
the uptake. A wizard with 
cards and dice. Never played 
for money, though.” 

“Umm,” Magnan said. 
“Don’t make the error of per- 
sonalizing this situation, Re- 
tief. Overall policy calls for a 
defense of these backwater 
worlds. Otherwise the Corps 
would allow history to follow 
its natural course, as always.” 
“When does this attack hap- 
pen?” 

“Less than four weeks.” 
“That doesn’t leave me 
much time.” 

“I have your itinerary here. 
Your accommodations are 
clear as far as Aldo Cerise. 
You’ll have to rely on your in- 
genuity to get you the rest of 
the way.” 

“That’s a pretty rough trip, 
Mr. Councillor. Suppose I 
don’t make it?” 

Magnan looked sour. “Some- 
one at a policy-making level 
has chosen to put all our eggs

in one basket, Retief. I hope 
their confidence in you is not 
misplaced/* 

"This a n t i a c conversion ; 
how long does it take?” 

"A skilled electronics crew 
can do the job in a matter of 
minutes. The Jorgensens can 
handle it very nicely; every 
other man is a mechanic of 
some sort.** 

Retief opened the envelope 
Magnan handed him and 
looked at the tickets inside. 

"Less than four hours to de- 
parture time,** he said. "I’d 
better not start any long 
books.** 

"You*d better waste no time 
getting over to Indoctrina- 
tion,** Magnan said. 

Retief stood up. "If I hurry, 
maybe I can catch the car- 
toon.*' 

"The allusion escapes me,” 
Magnan said coldly. "And one 
last word. The Soetti are pa- 
trolling the trade lanes into 
Jorgensen’s Worlds; don't get 
yourself interned.” 

"1*11 tell you what,” Retief 
said soberly. "In a pinch, 1*11 
mention your name.” 

"You’ll be traveling with 
Class X credentials,” Magnan 
snapped. "There must be noth- 
ing to connect you with the 
Corps.” 

"They’ll never guess,” Re- 
tief said. "I’ll pose as a gen- 
tleman.” 

"You’d better be getting 
started,” Magnan said, shuf- 
fling papers. 

"You’re right,” Retief said. 
"If I work at it, I might man- 

a 



age a snootful by takeoff.” He 
went to the door. "No objec- 
tion to my checking out a 
needier, is there?” 

Magnan looked up. "I sup- 
pose not. What do you want 
with it?” 

"Just a feeling I’ve got.” 
"Please yourself.” 

"Some day,” Retief said, "I 
may take you up on that.” 

II 

R etief put down the heavy 
travel-battered suitcase and 
leaned on the counter, study- 
ing the schedules chalked on 
the board under the legend 
"ALDO CERISE— INTER- 
PLANETARY.” A thin clerk 
in a faded sequined blouse and 
a plastic snakeskin cummer- 
bund groomed his fingernails, 
watching Retief from the cor- 
ner of his eye. 

Retief glanced at him. 

The clerk nipped off a 
ragged corner with rabbitlike 
front teeth and spat it on the 
floor. 

"Was there something?” he 
said. 

"Two twenty-eight, due out 
today for the Jorgensen 
group,” Retief said. "Is it on 
schedule?” 

The clerk sampled the in- 
side of his right cheek, eyed 
Retief. "Filled up. Try again 
in a couple of weeks.” 

"What time does it leave?” 
"I don’t think—” 

"Let’s stick to facts,” Retief 
said. "Don’t try to think. 
What time is it due out?” 



KEITH LAUMER 




The clerk smiled pityingly. 
^It^s my lunch hour, he sai^ 
*‘ril be open in an hour." He 
held up a thumb nail, frowned 
at it. 

"If I have to come around 
this counter,” Retief said, 
"I’ll feed that thumb to you 
the hard way.” 

The clerk looked up and 
opened his mouth. Then he 
caught Retief’s eye, closed his 
mouth and swallowed. 

"Like it says there,” he said, 
jerking a thumb at the board. 
"Lifts in an hour. But you 
won’t be on it,” he added. 

^ Retief looked at him. 

"Some,..ah...VIP’s re- 
quired accommodation,” he 
said. He hooked a finger in- 
side the sequined collar. "All 
tourist reservations were can- 
celed. You’ll have to try to get 
space on the Four-Planet Line 
ship next — ” . 

"Which gate?” Retief said. 

"For... ah...?” 

"For the two twenty-eight 
for Jorgensen’s Worlds,” Re- 
tief said. 

"Well,” the clerk said. "Gate 
19,” he added quickly. "But — ” 

Retief picked up his suit- 
case and walked away toward 
the glare sign reading To 
Gates 16-30. 

"Another smart alec,” the 
clerk said behind him. 

R etief followed the signs, 
threaded his way through 
crowds, found a covered ramp 
with the number 228 posted 
over it. A heavy-shouldered 
man with a scarred jawline 



and small eyes was slouching 
there in a rumpled gray uni- 
form. He put out a hand as 
Retief started past him. 

"Lessee your boarding 
pass,” he muttered. 

Retief pulled a paper from 
an inside pocket, handed it 
over. 

The guard blinked at it. 

"Whassat?” 

"A gram confirming my 
space,” Retief said. "Your boy 
on the counter says he’s out to 
lunch.” 

The guard crumpled the 
gram, dropped it on the floor 
and lounged back against the 
handrail. 

"On your way, bub.” he 
said. 

Retief put his suitcase care- 
fully on the floor, took a step 
and drove a right into the 
guard’s midriff. He stepped 
aside as the man doubled and 
went to his knees. 

"You were wide open, ugly. 
I couldn’t resist. Tell your 
boss I sneaked past while you 
were resting your eyes.” He 
picked up his bag, stepped 
over the man and v/ent up the 
gangway into the ship. 

A cabin boy in stained 
whites came along the corri- 
dor. 

"Which way to cabin fifty- 
seven, son?” Retief asked. 

"Up there.” The boy jerked 
his head and hurried on. Re- 
tief made his way along the 
narrow hall, found sifrns, fol- 
lowed them to cabin fifty-sev- 
en. The door was open. Inside, 
baggage was piled in the cen- 



THE FROZEN PLANET

ter of the floor. It was expen* 
sive looking baggage. 

Retief put his bag down. He 
turned at a sound ^hind him. 
A tall, florid man with an ex- 
pensive coat belted over a 
massive paunch stood in the 
open door, looking at Retief. 
Retief looked back. The florid 
man clamped his jaws togeth- 
er, turned to speak over his 
shoulder. 

“Somebody in the cabin. Get 
'em out." He rolled a cold eye 
at Retief as he backed out of 
the room. A short, thick- 
necked man appeared. 

“What are you doing in Mr. 
Tony’s room?" he barked. 
“Never mind ! Clear out of 
here, fellow! You’re keeping 
Mr. Tony waiting." 

“Too bad," Retief said. 
“Finders keepers." 

.“You nuts?" The thick- 
necked man stared at Retief. 
“I said it’s Mr. Tony’s room." 

“I don’t know Mr. Tony. 
He’ll have to bull his way into 
other quarters.” 

“We’ll see about you, mis- 
ter.” The man turned and went 
out. Retief sat on the bunk 
and lit a cigar. There was a 
sound of voices in the corri- 
dor. Two burly baggage- 
smashers appeared, straining 
at an oversized trunk. They 
maneuvered it through the 
door, lowered it, glanced at 
Retief and went out. The 
thick-necked man returned. 

“All right, you. Out,” he 
growled. “Or have I got to 
have you thrown out?" 

Retief rose and clamped the 



ci^r between his teeth. He 
gripped a handle of the brass- 
bound trunk in each hand, 
bent his knees and heaved the 
trunk up to chest level, then 
raised it overhead. He turned 
to the door. 

“Catch," he said between 
clenched teeth. The trunk 
slammed against the far wall 
of the corridor and burst. 

Retief turned to the bag- 
gage on the floor, tossed it 
into the halL The face of the 
thick-necked man appeared 
cautiously around the door 
jamb. 

“Mister, you must be — ’’ ^ 

“If you’ll excuse me," Re- 
tief said, “I want to catch a 
nap." He flipped the door 
shut, pulled off his shoes and 
stretched out on the bed. 

F ive minutes passed before 
the door rattled and burst 
open. 

Retief looked up. A gaunt 
leathery-skinned man wearing 
white ducks, a blue turtleneck 
sweater and a peaked cap tilt- 
ed raffishly over one eye 
stared at Retief. 

“Is this the joker?" he grat- 
ed. 

The thick-n e c k e d man 
edged past him, looked at Re- 
tief and snorted, “That’s him, 
sure." 

“I’m captain of this vessel," 
the first man said. “You’ve got 
two minutes to haul your 
freight out of here, buster." 

“When you can spare the 
time from vour other duties," 
Retief said, “take a look at

“A space lawyer,” The cap- 
tain turned. ”Throw him out, 
boys.” 

Two big men edged into the 
cabin, looking at Retief. 

“Go on, pitch him out,” the 
captain snapped. 

Retief put his cigar in an 
ashtray, and swung his feet 
off the bunk. 

“Don’t try it,” he said soft- 

ly- 

One of the two wiped his 
nose on a sleeve, spat on his 
right palm, and stepped for- 
ward, then hesitated. 

“Hey,” he said. “This the 
guy tossed the trunk off the 
wall?” 

“That’s him,” the thick- 
necked man called. “Spilled 
Mr. Tony’s possessions right 
on the deck.” 

“Deal me out,” the bouncer 
said. “He can stay put as long 
as he wants to. I signed on to 
move cargo. Let’s go, Moe.” 

“You’d better be getting 
back to the bridge. Captain.” 
Retief said. “We’re due to lift 
in twenty minutes.” 

The thick-necked man and 
the Captain both shouted at 
once. The Captain’s voice pre- 
vailed. 

*“ — twenty minutes. .uni- 

form Code. gonna do?” 

“Close the door as you

The thick-n e c k e d man 



paused at the door. “We’ll sec 
you when you come out.” 

Ill 

F our waiters passed Re- 
tief’s table without stop- 
ping. A fifth leaned against 
the wall nearby, a menu under 
his arm. 

At a table across the room, 
the Captain, now wearing a 
dress uniform and with his 
thin red hair neatly parted, 
sat with a table of male pas- 
sengers. He talked loudly and 
laughed frequently, casting 
occasional glances Retief’s 
way. 

A panel opened in the wall 
behind Retief’s chair. Bright 
blue eyes peered out from un- 
der a white chef’s cap. 

“Givin’ you the cold shoul- 
der, heh. Mister?” 

“Looks like it, old-timer,” 
Retief said. “Maybe I’d better 
go join the skipper. His party 
seems to be having all the 
fun.” 

“Feller has to be mighty 
careless who he eats with to 
set over there.” 

“I see your point.” 

“You set right where you’re 
at. Mister. I’ll rustle you up a 
plate.” 

Five minutes later, Retief 
cut into a thirty-two ounce 
Delmonico backed up with 
mushrooms and garlic butter. 

“I’m Chip,” the chef said. “I 
don’t like the Cap’n. You can 
tell him I said so. Don’t like 
his friends, either. Don’t like

man lik< he was a worm.** 
‘"You’ve got the right idea 
on frying a steak, Chip. And 
you’ve got the right idea on 
the Soetti, too,” Retief said. 
He poured red wine into a 
glass. “Here’s to you.” 

“Bern right,” Chip said. 
“Dunno who ever thought up 
broiling ’em. Steaks, that is. I 
got a Baked Alaska coming up 
in here for dessert. You like 
brandy in yer coffee?” 

“Chip, you’re a genius.” 
“Like to see a feller eat,” 
Chip said. “I gotta go now. If 
you need anything, holler.” 
Retief ate slowly. Time al- 
ways dragged on shipboard. 
Four days to J or gensen’s 
Worlds. Then, if Magnan’s in-* 
formation was correct, there 
would be four days to prepare 
for the Soetti attack. It was a 
temptation to scan the tapes 
built into the handle of his 
suitcase. It would be good to 
know what Jorgensen’s 
Worlds would be up against. 

Retief finished the steak, 
and the chef passed out the 
baked Alaska and coffee. Most 
of the other passengers had 
left the dining room. Mr. 
Tony and his retainers still 
sat at the Captain’s table. 

As Retief watched, four 
men arose from the table and 
sauntered across the room. 
The first in line, a stony-faced 
thug with a broken ear, took a 
cigar from his mouth as he 
reached the table. He dipped 
the lighted end in Retief’s 
coffee, looked at it, and 
dropped it on the tablecloth.

The others came up, Mr. 
Tony trailing. 

“You must want to get to 
Jorgensen’s pretty bad,” the 
thug said in a grating voice. 
“What's your game, hick?” 

Retief looked at the coffee 
cup, picked it up. 

“I don’t think I want my 
coffee,” he said. He looked at 
the thug. “You drink it.” 

The thug squinted at Re- 
tief. “A wise hick,” he began. 

With a flick of the wrist, 
Retief tossed the coffee into 
the thug’s face, then stood and 
slammed a straight right to 
the chin. The thug went down. 

Retief looked at Mr. Tony, 
still standing open-mouthed. 

“You can take your play- 
mates away now, Tony,” he 
said. “And don’t bother to 
come around yourself. You’re 
not funny enough.” 

Mr. Tony found his voice. 

“Take him. Marbles!” he 
growled. 

The thick-n e c k e d man 
slipped a hand inside his timic 
and brought out a long-bladed 
knife. He licked his lips and 
moved in. 

Retief heard the panel open 
beside him. 

“Here you go. Mister,” Chip 
said. Retief darted a glance; 
a well-honed french knife lay 
on the sill. 

“Thanks, Chip,” Retief said. 
“I won’t need it for these 
punks.” 

Thick-neck lunged and Re- 
tief hit him square in the f^ce, 
knocking him under the table. 
The other man stepped back.

fumbling a power pistol from 
bis shoulder holster. 

‘‘Aim tliat at me, and I'll 
kill you/' Retief said. 

“Go on, burn him !" Mr. 
Tony shouted. Behind him, 
the captain appeared, white- 
faced. 

“Put that away, you!" he 
yelled. “What kind of—" 

“Shut up," Mr. Tony said. 
“Put it away, Hoany. We'll 
fix this bum later.” 

“Not on this vessel, you 
won't,” the captain said shaki- 
ly. “I got my charter to con- 
sider.” 

“Ram your charter,” Hoany 
said harshly. “You won't be 
needing it long.” 

“Button your floppy mouth, 
damn you !” Mr. Tony 
snapped. He looked at the man 
on the floor. “Get Marbles out 
of here. I ought to dump the 
slob.” 

He turned and walked away. 
The captain signaled and two 
waiters came up. Retief 
watched as they carted the 
casualty from the dining 
room. 

The panel opened. 

“I usta be about your size, 
when I was your age," Chip 
said. “You handled &em pan- 
sies right. I wouldn't give 'em 
the time o’ day.” 

“How about a fresh cup of 
coffee. Chip?” Retief said. 

“Sure, Mister. Anything 
else?” 

“I'll think of somediing,” 
Retief said. “This is shaping 
tn> into one of those long 
days.”

don’t like me bring- 
A ing yer meals to you in 
yer cabin,” Chip said. “But 
the cap'n knows I'm the best 
cook in the Merchant Service. 
They won't mess with me.” 

“What has Mr. Tony grt on 
the captain. Chip?” Retief 
asked. 

“They're in some kind o' 
crooked business together. 
You want some more smoked 
turkey?” 

“Sure. What have they got 
against my going to Jorgen- 
sen's Worlds?" 

“Dunno. Hasn't been no 
tourists got in there fer six or 
eight months. 1 sure like a fel- 
ler that can put it away. I was

“I'll bet you can still handle

“That's where I'm lucky, 
Chip, What kind of cargo's

“Derned if I know. In and

“To Alabaster. That's nine

“Have one, Chip. I guess I

“Pleilty o’ space, Mister.

alight, then cleared away the 
dishes, poured out coffee and 
brandy.

don’t like,” he said. 

Retief looked at him ques- 
tioningly. 

“You never seen a Sweaty? 
Ugly lookin’ devils. Skinny 
legs, like a lobster; big chest, 
shaped like the top of a tur- 
nip; rubbery lookin’ head. You 
can see the pulse beatin’ when 
they get riled.” 

“I’ve never had the pleas- 
ure,” Retief said. 

“You prob’ly have it perty 
soon. Them devils board us 
nigh ever trip out. Act like 
they was the Customs Patrol 
or somethin’.” 

There was a distant clang, 
and a faint tremor ran through 
the Uoor. 

“I ain’t superstitious ner 
nothin’,” Chip said. “But I’ll 
be triple-damned if that ain’t 
them boarding us now.” 

Ten minutes passed before 
bootsteps sounded outside the 
door, accompanied by a click- 
ing patter. The doorknob rat- 
tled, then a heavy knock 
shook the door. 

“They got to look you 



over,’* Chip whispered. “Nosy 
damn Sweaties.” 

“Unlock it. Chip.” The chef 
opened the door. 

“Come in, damn you,” he 
said. 

A tall and grotesque crea- 
ture minced into the room, 
tiny hoof-like feet tapping on 
the floor. A flaring metal hel- 
met shaded the deep-set com- 
pound eyes, and a loose mantle 
flapped around the knobbed 
knees. Behind the alien, the 
captain hovered nervously. 

“Yo’ p a p i s s,” the alien 
rasped. 

“Who’s your friend. Cap- 
tain?” Retief said. 

“Never mind; just do like 
he tells you.” 

“Yo’ papiss,” the alien said 
again. 

“Okay,” Retief said. “I’ve 
seen it. You can take it away 
now.” 

“Don’t horse arouiid,” the 
captain said. “This fellow can 
get mean.” 

The alien brought two tiny 
arms out from the conceal- 
ment of the mantle, clicked 
toothed pincers under Retief’s 
nose. 

“Quick, soft one.” 

“Captain, tell your friend to 
keep its distance. It looks 
brittle, and I’m tempted to test 
it.” 

“Don’t start anything with 
Skaw; he can clip through 
steel with those snappers.” 

“Last chance,” Retief said. 
Sfeiw stood poised, open 
pincers an inch from Retief’s 
eyes.

^Show him your paptr£, you 
damned fool/’ the captain said 
hoarsely. ‘"I got no control 
over Skaw.” 

T he alien clicked both pin- 
cers with a sharp report, 
and in the same instant Retief 
half-turned to the left, leaned 
away from the alien and drove 
his right foot against the 
slender leg above the bulbous 
knee-joint. Skaw screeched 
and floundered, greenish fluid 
spattering from the burst 
joint. 

‘"I told you he was brittle,” 
Retief said. ‘‘Next time you 
invite pirates aboard, don’t 
bother to call.” 

“Jesus, what did you do! 
They’ll kill us!” the captain 
gasped, staring at the figure 
flopping on the floor. 

“Cart poor old Skaw back to 
his boat,” Retief said. “Tell 
him to pass the word. No more 
illegal entry and search of 
Terrestrial vessels in Terres- 
trial space.” 

“Hey,” Chip said. “He’s quit 
kicking.” 

The captain bent over Skaw, 
gingerly rolled him over. He 
leaned close and sniffed. 

“He’s dead.” The captain 
stared at Retief. “We’re all 
dead men,” he said. “These 
Soetti got no mercy.” 

“They won’t need it. Tell 
’em to sheer off; their fun is 
over.” 

“They got no more emotions 
than a blue crab—” 

“You bluff easily. Captain. 
Show a few guns as you hand 



the body back. We know tiieir 
secret now.” 

“What secret? I—” 

“Don’t be no dumber than 
you got to, Cap’n,” Chip said. 
“Sweaties die easy; that’s the 
secret.” 

“Maybe you got a point,” 
the captain said, looking at 
Retief. “All they got’s a three- 
man scout. It couU work.” 

He went out, came back 
with two crewmen. They 
hauled the dead alien gingerly 
into the hall. 

“Maybe I can run a bluff on 
the Soetti,” the captain said, 
looking back from the door.. 
“But I’ll be back to see you 
later.” 

“You don’t scare us, Cap’n,” 
Chip said. “Him and Mr. Tony 
and all his goons. You hit ’em 
where they live, that time. 
They’re pals o’ these Sweaties. 
Runnin’ some kind o’ crooked 
racket.” 

“You’d better take the cap- 
tain’s advice, Chip. There’s no 
point in your getting involved 
in my problems.” 

“They’d of killed you be- 
fore now, Mister, if they had 
any guts. That’s where we got 
it over these monkeys. They 
got no guts.” 

“They act scared. Chip. 
Scared men are killers.” 

“They don’t scare me none.” 
Chip picked up the tray. “I’ll 
scout around a little and see 
what’s goin’ on. If the Sweat- 
ies figure to do anything 
about that Skaw feller they’ll 
have to move fast; they won’t 
try nothin’ close to port.”

•^Don't worry, Chip. I have 
reason to be pretty sure they 
won’t do anything to attract a 
lot of attention in this sector 
just now.’’ 

Chip looked at Retief. “You 
ain’t no tourist. Mister. I 
know that much. You didn’t 
come out here for fun, did 
you?” 

“That,” Retief said, “would 
be a hard one to answer.” 

IV 

R etief awoke at a tap on 
his door. 

“It’s me. Mister. Chip.” 
“Come on in.” 

The chef entered the room, 
locking the door. 

“You shoulda had that door 
locked.” He stood by the door, 
listening, then turned to Re- 
tief. 

“You want to get to Jorgen- 
sen’s perty bad, don’t you. 
Mister?” 

“That’s right. Chip.” 

“Mr. Tony give the captain 
a real hard time about old 
Skaw. The Sweaties didn’t say 
nothin’. Didn’t even act sur- 
prised, just took the remains 
and pushed off. But Mr. Tony 
and that other crook they call 
Marbles, they was fit to be 
tied. Took the cap’n in his 
cabin and talked loud at him 
fer half a hour. Then the cap’n 
come out and give some orders 
to the Mate.” 

Retief sat up and reached 
for a cigar. 

“Mr. Tony and Skaw were 
pals, eh?” 



“He hated Skaw’s guts. But 
with him it was business. Mis- 
ter, you got a gun?” 

“A 2mm needier. Why?” 
“The orders cap’n give was 
to change course fer Alabas- 
ter. We’re by-passin’ Jorgen- 
sen’s Worlds. We’ll feel the 
course change any minute.” ^ 
Retief lit the cigar, reached 
under the mattress and took 
out a short-barreled pistol. He 
dropped it in his pocket, 
looked at Chip. 

“Maybe it was a good 
thought, at that. Which way 
to the Captain’s cabin?” 

^^'THIS is it,” Chip said 
softly. “You want me to 
keep an eye on who comes 
down the passage?” 

Retief nodded, opened the 
door and stepped into the cab- 
in. The captain looked ^up 
from his desk, then jumped 
up. 

“What do you think you’re 
doing, busting in here?” 

“I hear you’re planning a 
course change, Captain.” 
“You’ve got damn big ears.” 
“I think we’d better call in 
at Jorgensen’s.” 

“You do, huh?” ^he captain 
sat down. “I’m in command of 
this vessel,’' he said. “I’m 
changing course for Alabas- 
ter.” 

“I wouldn’t find it conveni- 
ent to go to Alabaster,” Retief 
said. “So just hold your course 
for Jorgensen’s.” 

“Not bloody likely.” 

“Your use of the word 
‘bloody’ is interesting, Cap- 

IT 



THE FROZEN PLANET 




tain. Don’t try to change 
course.” 

The captain reached for the 
mike on his desk, pressed the 
key. 

“Power Section, this is the 
c a p t a i n,” he said. Retief 
reached across the desk, 
gripped the captain’s wrist. 

“Tell the mate to hold his 
present course,” he said ^ft- 

ly* 

“Let go my hand, buster,” 
the captain snarled. Eyes on 
Retief’s, he eased a drawer 
open with his left hand, 
reached in. Retief kneed the 
drawer. The captain yelped 
and dropped the mike. 

“You busted it, you — ” 

“And one to go,” Retief 
said. “Tell him.” 

“I’m an officer of the Mer- 
chant Service!” 

“You’re a cheapjack who’s 
sold his bridge to a pack of 
back-alley hoods.” 

“You can’t put it over, 
hick.” 

“Tell him.” 

The captain groaned and 
picked up the mike. “Captain 
to Power Section,” he said. 
“Hold your present course un- 
til you hear from me.” He 
dropped the mike and looked 
up at Retief. 

“It’s eighteen hours yet be- 
fore we pick up Jorgensen 
Control. You going to sit here 
and bend my arm the whole 
time?” 

Retief released the captain’s 
wrist and turned to the door. 

“Chip, I’m locking the door. 
You circulate around, let me 



know what’s going on. Bring 
me a pot of coffee every so of- 
ten. I’m sitting up with a sick 
friend.” 

“Right, Mister. Keep an eye 
on that jasper; he’s slippery.” 

“What are you going to 
do?” the captain demanded. 

Retief settled himself in a 
chair. 

“Instead of strangling you, 
as you deserve,” he said, “I’m 
going to stay here and help 
you hold your course for Jor- 
gensen’s Worlds.” 

The captain looked at Re- 
tief He laughed, a short bark. 

“Then I’ll just stretch out 
and have a little nap, farmer. 
If you feel like dozing off 
sometime during the next 
eighteen hours, don’t mind 
me. 

Retief took out the needier 
and put it on the desk before 
him. 

“If anything happens that I 
don’t like,” he said, “I’ll wake 
you up. With this.” 

C^'W/HY don’t you let me 
spell you, Mister?” 
Ch^p said. “Four hours to go 
yet. You’re gonna hafta be on 

yer toes to handle the land- 
** 

ing. 

“I’ll be all right. Chip. You 
get some sleep.” 

“Nope. Many’s the time I 
stood four, five watches 
rnnr>’n’, back when I was yer 
age. I’ll make another round.” 

Retief stood up, stretched 
his legs, paced the floor, 
stared at the repeater instru- 
ments on the wall. Things had 



18 



KEITH LAUMER 




gone quietly so far, but the 
landing would be another mat- 
ter. The captain’s absence 
from the bridge during the 
highly complex maneuvering 
would be difficult to ex- 
plain. 

The desk speaker crackled. 

’’Captain, Officer of the 
Watch here. Ain’t it about 
time you was getting up here 
with the orbit figures?” 

Retief nudged the captain. 
He awoke with a start, sat up. 

“ W h a z z a t ?” He looked 
wild-eyed at Retief. 

“Watch officer wants orbit 
.figures,” Retief said, nodding 
toward the speaker. 

The captain rubbed his eyes, 
shook his head, picked up the 
mike. Retief released the safe- 
ty on the needier with an audi- 
ble click. 

“Watch Officer, I’ll... ah 
...get some figures for you 
right away. I’m. .ah. .busy 
right now.” 

“What the hell you talking 
about, busy?” the speaker 
blared. ’’You ain’t got them 
figures ready, you’ll have a 
hell of a hot time getting ’em 
up in the next three minutes. 
You forgot your approach pat- 
tern or something?” 

“I guess I overlooked it,” 
the Captain said, looking side- 
ways at Retief. “I’ve been 
busy.” 

“One for your side,” Retief 
said. He reached for the cap- 
tain. 

“I’ll make a deal,” the cap- 
tain squalled. “Your life 
for—” 



Retief took aim and 
slammed a hard right to the 
captain’s jaw. He slumped to 
the floor. 

Retief glanced around the 
room, yanked wires loose from 
a motile lamp, trussed the 
man’s hands and feet, stuffed 
his mouth with paper and 
taped it. 

Chip tapped at the door. Re- 
tief opened it and the chef 
stepped inside, looking at the 
man on the floor. 

“The jasper tried somethin’, 
huh? Figured he would. What 
we goin’ to do now?” 

“The captain forgot to set 
up an approach, Chip. He out- 
foxed me.” 

“If we overrun our approach 
pattern,” Chip said, “we can’t 
make orbit at Jorgensen’s on 
automatic. And a manual ap- 
proach — ” 

“That’s out. But there’s an- 
other possibility.” 

Chip blinked. “Only one 
thing you could mean. Mister. 
But cuttin’ out in a lifeboat in 
deep space is no picnic.” 

“They’re on the port side, 
aft, right?” 

Chip nodded. “Hot damn,” 
he said. “Who’s got the ’tater 
salad?” 

“We’d better tuck the skip- 
per away out of sight.” 

“In the locker.” 

The two men carried the 
limp body to a deep storage 
chest, dumped it in, closed the 
lid. 

“He won’t suffercate. Lid’s 
a lousy fit.” 

Retief opened the door

went into the corridor. Chip 
behind him. 

‘‘Shouldn’t oughta be no- 
body around now,’' the chef 
said. “Everybody’s mannin’ 
approach stations.” 

A t the D deck companion- 
way, Retief stopped sud- 
denly. 

“Listen.” 

Chip cocked his head. “I 
don’t hear nothin’,” he whis- 
pered. 

“Sounds like a sentry post- 
ed on the lifeboat deck,” Re- 
tief said softly. 

“^Let’s take him. Mister.” 

“I’ll go down. Stand by. 
Chip.” 

Retief started down the nar- 
row steps, half stair, half lad- 
der. Halfway, he paused to 
listen. There was a sound of 
slow footsteps, then silence. 
Retief palmed the needier, 
went down the last steps 
quickly, emerged in the dim 
light of a low ceilinged room. 
The stern of a five-man life- 
boat bulked before him. 

“Freeze, you!” a cold voice 
snapped. 

Retief dropped, rolled be- 
hind the shelter of the life- 
boat as the whine of a power 
pistol echoed off metal walls. 
A lunge, and he was under the 
boat, on his feet. He jumped, 
caught the quick-access han- 
dle, hauled it down. The out- 
er port cycled open. 

Feet scrambled at the bow 
of the boat. Retief whirled 
and fired. The guard rounded 
into sight and fell headlong. 

20 



Above, an alarm bell jangled. 
Retief stepped on a stanchion, 
hauled himself into the open 
port. A yell rang, then the 
clatter of feet on the stair. 

“Don’t shoot. Mister!” Chip 
shouted. 

“All clear. Chip,” Retief 
called. 

“Hang on. I’m cornin’ with 
ya !” 

Retief reached down, lift- 
ed the chef bodily through the 
port, slanuned the lever home. 
The outer door whooshed, 
clanged shut. 

“Take number two, tie in! 
I’ll blast her off,” Chip said. 
“Been through a hundred 
’bandon ship drills. .” 

Retief watched as the chef 
flipped levers, pressed a fat 
red button. The deck trembled 
under the lifeboat. 

“Blew the bay doors,” Chip 
said, smiling happily. “That’ll 
cool them jaspers down.” He 
punched a green button. 

“Look out, Jorgensen’s!” 
With an ear-splitting blast, 
the stern rockets fired, a sus- 
tained agony of pressure. 

Abruptly, there was silence. 
Weightlessness. Contracting 
metal pinged loudly. Chip’s 
breathing rasped in the still- 
ness. 

“Pulled nine G’s there for 
ten seconds,” he gasped. “I 
gave her full emergency kick- 
off.” 

“Any armament aboard our 
late host?” 

“A popgun. Time they get 
their wind, we’ll be clear. Now 
all we got to do is set tight 



KEITH LAUMER 




till we pick up a R and D 
from Svea Tower. Maybe four, 
five hours.” 

"Chip, you're a wonder,” 
Retief said. "This looks like a 
good time to catch that nap.” 

"Me too,” Chip said. 
"Mighty peaceful here, ain't 
it?” 

There was a moment's si- 
lence. 

"Durn!” Chip said softly. 

Retief opened one eye. 
"Sorry you came, Chip?” 

"Left my best carvin' knife 
jammed up 'tween Marbles' 
ribs,” the chef said. "Comes o' 
doin’ things in a hurry.” 

V 

T he blopde girl brushed her 
hair from her eyes and 
smiled at Retief. 

"I'm the only one on duty,” 
she said. "I'm Anne-Marie.” 
"It's important that I talk 
to someone in your govern- 
ment, Miss,” Retief said. 

The girl looked at Retief. 
"The men you want to see are 
Tove and Bo Bergman. They 
will be at the lodge by night- 
fall.” 

"Then it looks like we go to 
the lodge,” Retief said. "Lead 
on, Anne-Marie.” 

"What about the boat?” 
Chip asked. 

"I'll send someone to see to 
it tomorrow,” the girl said. 

"You're some gal,” Chip said 
admiringly. "Bern near six 
feet, ain't ye? And built, too, 
what I mean.” 

They stepped out of the 
door into a whipping wind. 

THE FROZEN PLANET 



"Let's go across to die 
equipment sbed and get 
parkas for you,” Anne-Marie 
said. "It will be cold on the 
slopes.” 

"Yeah,” Chip said, shiver- 
ing. "I've heard you folks 
don't believe in ridin' ever 
time you want to go a few 
miles uphill in a blizzard.” 

"It will make us hungry.” 
Anne-Marie said. "Then Chip 
will cook a wonderful meal 
for us all.” 

Chip blinked. "Been cookin' 
too long,” he muttered. 
"Didn't know it showed on 
me that way.” 

Behind the sheds across the 
wind-s c o u r e d ramp abrupt 
peaks rose, snow-blanketed. A 
faint trail led across white 
slopes, disappearing into low 
clouds. 

"The lodge is above Ae 
cloud layer,” Anne-Marie said. 
"Up there the sky is always 
clear.” 

It was three hours later, and 
the sun was burning the 
peaks red, when Anne-Marie 
stopped, pulled off her woolen 
cap and waved at the vista be- 
low. 

"There you see it,” she said. 
"Our valley.” 

"It's a mighty perty sight,” 
Chip gasped. "Anything this 
tough to get a look at ought to 
be.” 

Ann e-M arie pointed. 
"There,” she said. "The little 
red house by itself. Do you 
see it, Retief? It is my fa- 
ther's home-acre.” 

Retief looked across the 

21 




valley. Gaily painted houses 
nestled together, a puddle of 
color in the bowl of the valley. 

‘"I think you’ve led a good 
life there,” he said. 

Anne-Marie smiled bril- 
liantly. ‘"And this day, too, is 
good.” 

Retief smiled back. “Yes,” 
he said. “This day is good.” 

“It’ll be a durn sight better 
when I got my feet up to that 
big fire you was talking about, 
Annie,” Chip said. 

They climbed on, crossed a 
shoulder of broken rock, 
reached the final slope. Above, 
the lodge sprawled, a long low 
structure of heavy logs, out- 
lined against the deep-blue 
twilight sky. Smoke billowed 
from stone chimneys at either 
end, and yellow light gleamed 
from the narrow windows, re- 
flected on the snow. Men and 
women stood in groups of 
three or four, skis over their 
shoulders. Their voices and 
laughter rang in the icy air. 

Anne-Marie whistled shril- 
ly. Someone waved. 

“Come,” she said. “Meet all 
my friends.” 

A man separated himself 
from the group, walked down 
the slope to meet them. 

“Anne-Marie,” he called. 
“Welcome. It was a long day 
without you.” He came up to 
them, hugged Anne-Marie, 
smiled at Retief. 

“Welcome,” he said. “Come 
inside and be warm.” 

They crossed the trampled 
snow to the lodge and pushed 
through a heavy door into a 

22 



vast low-beamed hall, crowded 
with people, talking, singing, 
some sitting at long plank ta- 
bles, others ringed around an 
eight-foot fireplace at the far 
side of the room. Anne-Marie 
led the way to a bench near 
the fire. She made introduc- 
tions and found a stool to prop 
Chip’s feet near the blaze. 

Chip looked around. 

“I never seen so many perty 
gals before,” he said delight- 
edly. 

“Poor Chip,” one girl said. 
“His feet are cold.” She knelt 
to pull off his boots. “Let me 
rub them,” she said. 

A brunette with blue eyes 
raked a chestnut from the 
fire, cracked it and offered it 
to Retief. A tall man with 
arms like oak roots passed 
heavy beer tankards to the 
two guests. 

“Tell us about the places 
you’ve seen,” someone called. 
Chip emerged from a long 
pull at the mug, heaving a 
sigh. 

“Well,” he said. “I tell you 
I been in some places. .” 

Music started up, rising 
above the clamor. 

“Come, Retief,” Anne-Marie 
said. “Dance with me.” 

Retief looked at her. “My 
thought exactly,” he said. 

C HIP put down his mug 
and sighed. “Derned if I 
ever felt right at home so 
quick before,” he said. “Just 
seems like these folks know 
all about me.” He scratched 
behind his right ear. “Annie 



KEITH LAUMER 




must o’ called ’em up and told 
’em our names an’ all.” He 
lowered his voice. 

“They’s some kind o* trou- 
ble in the air, though. Some o’ 
the remarks they passed 
sounds like they’re lookin’ to 
have some trouble with the 
Sweaties. Don’t seem to wor- 
ry ’em none, though.” 

”Chip,” Retief said, ”how 
much do these people know 
about the Soetti?” 

”Dunno,” Chip said. ”We 
useta touch down here, regler. 
But I always jist set in my 
galley and worked on ship 
models or somethin’. I hear 
the Sweaties been nosin’ 
around here some, though.” 
Two girls came up to Chip. 
”Hey, I gotta go now. Mis- 
ter,” he said. “These gals got 
a idea I oughta take a hand in 
the kitchen.” 

“Smart girls,” Retief said. 
He turned as Anne-Marie 
came up. 

“Bo Bergman and Tove are 
not back yet,” she said. “They 
stayed to ski after moonrise.” 
“That moon is something,” 
Retief said. “Almost like day- 
light.” 

“They will come soon, now. 
Shall we go out to see the 
moonlight on the snow?” 
Outside, long black shadows 
fell like ink on silver. The 
top of the cloud layer below 
glared white under the im- 
mense moon. 

“Our sister world, Gota,” 
Anne-Marie said. “Nearly as 
big as Svea. I would like to 
visit it someday, although 

THE FROZEN PLANET 



they say it’s all stone and ice.” 
“Anne-Marie,” Retief said, 
“how many people live On Jor- 
gensen’s Worlds?” 

“About fifteen million, most 
of us here on Svea. There are 
mining camps and ice-fisher- 
ies on Gota. No one lives on 
Vasa and Skone, but there are 
always a few hunters there.” 
“Have you ever fought a 
war?” 

Anne-Marie turned to look 
at Retief. 

“You are afraid for us, Re- 
tief,” she said. “The Soetti 
will attack our worlds, and we 
will fight them. We have 
fought before. These planets 
were not friendly ones.” 

“I thought the Soetti attack 
would be a surprise to you,” 
Retief said. “Have you made 
any preparation for it?” 

“We have ten thousand mer- 
chant ships. When the enemy 
comes, we will meet them.” 
Retief frowned. “Are there 
any guns on this planet? Any 
missiles?” 

Anne-Marie shook her head. 
“Bo Bergman and Tove have 
a plan of deployment — ” 
“Deployment, hell! Against 
a modern assault force you 
need modern armament.” 
“Look!” Ann e-M a r i e 

touched Retief ’s arm. 

“They’re coming now.” 

Two tall grizzled men came 
up the slope, skis over their 
shoulders. Anne-Marie went 
forward to meet them, Retief 
at her side. 

The two came up, embraced 
the girl, shook hands with Re- 

23 




tief, put down their skis. 

“Welcome to Svea,” Tove 
said. “Let’s find a warm cor- 
ner where we can talk.’* 

R ETIEF shook his head, 
smiling, as a tall girl with 
coppery hair offered a vast 
slab of venison. 

“I’ve caught up,” he said, 
“far every hungry day I ever 
lived.” 

Bo Bergman poured Retief’s 
beer mug full. 

“Our captains are the best 
in space,” he said. “Our popu- 
lation is concentrated in half 
a hundred small cities all 
across the planet. We know 
where the Soetti must strike 
us. We will ram their major 
vessels with umnanned ships. 
On the ground, we will hunt 
them down with small-arms.” 
“An assembly line turning 
out penetration missiles 
would have been more to the 
point.” 

“Yes,” Bo Bergman said. “If 
we had known.” 

“How long have you known 
the Soetti were planning to 
hit you?” 

Tove raised his eyebrows. 
“Since this afternoon,” he 
said. 

“How did you find out 
about it? That information is 
supposed in some quarters to 
be a well- 2 :uarded secret.” 
“Secret?” Tove said. 

Chip pulled at Retief*s arm. 
“Mister,” he said in Retief’s 
ear. “Come here a minute.” 
Retief looked at Anne-Ma- 
rie, across at Tove and Bo 



Bergman. He rubbed the side 
of his face with his hand. 

“Excuse me,” he said. He 
followed Chip to one side of 
the room. 

“Listen!” Chip said. “Maybe 
I’m goin’ bats, but I’ll swear 
there’s somethin’ funny here. 
I’m back there mixin’ a sauce 
knowed only to me and the 
devil and 1 dog if them gals 
don’t pass me ever dang spice 
I need, without me sayin’ a 
word. Come to put my souffle 
in the oven — she’s already set, 
right on the button at 350. An’ 
just now I’m settin’ lookin’ at 
one of ’em bendin’ over a tub 
o’ apples — snazzy little bru- 
nette name of Leila — derned 
if she don’t turn around and 
say — ” Chip gulped. “Never 
mind. Point is...” His voice 
nearly faltered. “It’s almost 
like these folks was readin’ 
my mind!” 

Retief patted Chip on the 
shoulder. 

“Don’t worry about your 
sanity. Old Timer,” he said. 
“That’s exactly what they’re 
doing.” 

VI 

44Tj|7TE’VE never tried to 
make a secret of it,” 
Tove said. “But we haven’t 
advertised it, either.” 

“It really isn’t much,” Bo 
Bergman said. “Not a mutant 
ability, our scholars say. Rath- 
er, it’s a skill we’ve stumbled 
on, a closer empathy. We are 
few, and far from the old 
home world. We’ve had to

learn to break down the walls 
we had built around our 
minds.” 

^Can you read the Soetti?” 
Hetief asked. 

Tove shook his head. 
‘"They^re very different from 
us. It’s painful to touch their 
minds. We can only sense the 
sub-vocalized thoughts of a 
human mind.” 

‘‘WeVe seen very few of the 
Soetti,” Bo Bergman said. 
‘TTheir ships have landed and 
taken on stores. They say lit- 
tle to us, but weVe felt their 
contempt. They envy us our 
worlds. They come from a 
cold land.” 

“Anne-Marie says you have 
a plan of defense,” Retief 
said. “A sort of suicide squad- 
ron idea, followed by guer- 
rilla warfare.” 

••It’s the best we can devise, 
Retief. If there aren’t too 
many of them, it might work.” 

Retief shook his head. ”It 
might delay matters — ^but not 
much.” 

“Perhaps. But our remote 
control equipment is excel- 
lent. And we have plenty of 
ships, albeit unarmed. And 
our people know how to live 
on the slopes — and how to 
shoot.” 

“There are too many of 
them, Tove,” Retief said. 
“They breed like flies and, ac- 
cording to some sources, they 
mature in a matter of months. 
They’ve been feeling their 
way into the sector for years 
now. Set up outposts on a 
thousand or so minor planets 



—cold ones, the kind they 
like. They want your worlds 
because they need living 
space.” 

“At least, your warning 
makes it possible for us to 
muster some show of force, 
Retief,” Bo Bergman said. 
“That is better than death by 
ambush.” 

“Retief must not be trapped 
here,” Anne-Marie said. “His 
small boat is useless now. He 
must have a ship.” 

“Of c o u r s e,” Tove said. 
“And—” 

“My mission here — ” Retief 
said. 

“Retief,” a voice called. “A 
message for you. The operator 
has phoned up a gram.” 

Retief unfolded the slip of 
paper. It was short, in verbal 
code, and signed by Magnan. 

“You are recalled herewith,” 
he read. “Assignment can- 
celed. Agreement concluded 
with Soetti relinquishing all 
claims so-called Jorgensen 
system. Utmost importance 
that under no repeat no cir- 
cumstances classified intelli- 
gence regarding Soetti be di- 
vulged to locals. Advise you 
depart instanter. Soetti^ occu- 
pation imminent.” 

Retief looked thoughtfully 
at the scrap of paper, then 
crumpled it and dropped it on 
the floor. He turned to Bo 
Bergman, took a tiny reel of 
tape from his pocket. 

“This contains informa- 
tion,” he said. “The Soetti at- 
tack plan, a defensive plan

sion of a standard anti-accel- 
eration unit into a potent 
weapon. If you have a screen 
handy, we’d better get started. 
We have about seventy-two 
hours.” 

I N the Briefing Room at 
Svea Tower, Tove snapped 
off the projector. 

“Our plan would have been 
worthless against that,” he 
said. “We assumed they’d 
make their strike from a 
standard in-line formation. 
This scheme of hitting all our 
settlements simultaneously, in 
a random order from all points 
— ^we’d have been helpless.” 
“It’s perfect for this de- 
fensive plan,” Bo Bergman 
said. “Assuming this antiac 
trick works.” 

“It works,” Retief said. “I 
hope you’ve got plenty of 
heavy power lead available.” 
“We export copper,” Tove 
said. 

“We’ll assign about two 
hundred vessels to each settle- 
ment. Linked up, they should 
throw up quite a field.” 

“It ought to be effective up 
to about fifteen miles, I’d es- 
timate,” Tove said. “If it 
works as it’s supposed to.” 

A red light flashed on the 
communications panel. Tove 
went to it, flipped a key. 
“Tower, Tove here,” he said. 
“I’ve got a ship on the 
scope, Tove,” a voice said. 
“There’s nothing scheduled. 
ACI 228 by-passed at 1600 . 
“Just one?” 

“A lone ship, coming in on 



a bearing of 291/456/653. On 
manual, rd say.” 

“How does this track key in 
with the idea of ACI 228 mak- 
ing a manual correction for a 
missed automatic approach?” 
Retief asked. 

Tove talked to the tower, 
got a reply. 

“That’s it,” he said. 

“How long before he 
touches down?” 

Tove glanced at a lighted 
chart. “Perhaps eight minutes. 

“Any guns here?” 

Tove shook his head. 

“If that’s old 228, she ain’t 
got but the one 50mm rifle,” 
Chip said. “She cain’t figure 
on jumpin’ the whole planet.” 

“Hard to say what she fig- 
ures on,” Retief said. “Mr. 
Tony will be in a mood for 
drastic measures.” 

“I wonder what kind o’ deal 
the skunks got with the 
Sweaties.” Chip said. “Prob’ly 
he gits to scavenge, after the 
Sweaties kill off the Jorgen- 
sens.” 

“He’s upset about our leav- 
ing him without saying good- 
bye, Chip,” Retief said. “And 
you left the door hanging 
open, too.” 

Chip cackled. “Old Mr. 
Tony don’t look so good to 
the Sweaties now, hey, Mis- 
ter?” 

Retief turned to Bo Berg- 
man. 

“Chip’s right,” he said. “A 
Soetti died on the ship, and a 
tourist got through the cor- 
don. Tony’s out to redeem 
himself.”

“He’s on final now,” the 
tower operator said. “Still no 
contact.” 

“We’ll know soon enough 
what he has in mind,” Tove 
said. 

“Let’s take a look.” 
Outside, the four men 
watched the point of fire 
grow, evolve into a ship pon- 
derously settling to rest. The 
drive faded and cut; silence 
fell. 

I NSIDE the Briefing Room, 
the speaker called out. Bo 
Bergman went inside, talked 
to the tower, motioned to the 
others. 

“—over to you,” the speaker 
was saying. There was a 
crackling moment of silence ; 
then another voice. 

“ — illegal entry. Send the 
two of them out. I’ll see to it 
they’re dealt with.” 

Tove fipped a key. “Switch 
me direct to the ship,” he said. 
“Right.” 

“You on ACI 228,” Tove 
said. “Who are you?” 

“What’s that to you?” 

“You weren’t cleared to 
berth here. Do you have an 
emergency aboard?” 

“Never mind that, you,” the 
speaker rumbled. “I tracked 
the bird in. I got the lifeboat 
on the screen now. They 
haven’t gone far in nine hours. 
Let’s have ’em.” 

“You’re wasting your time,” 
Tove said. 

There was a momentary si- 
lence. 

“You think so, hah?” the 



speaker blared. “I’ll put it to 
you straight. 1 see two guys 
on their way out in one min- 
ute, or I open up.” 

“He’s bluffin’”. Chip said. 
“The popgun won’t bear on 
us.” 

“Take a look out the win- 
dow,” Retief said. 

In the white glare of the 
moonlight, a loading cover 
swung open at the stern of 
the ship, dropped down and 
formed a sloping ramp. A 
squat and massive shape ap- 
peared in the opening, trun- 
dled down onto the snow- 
swept tarmac. 

Chip whistled. “I told you 
the Captain was slippery,” he 
muttered. “Where the devil’d 
he git that at?” 

“What is it?” Tove asked. 

“A tank,” Retief said. “A 
museum piece, by the look of 
it.” 

“I’ll say,” Chip said. That’s 
a Bolo Resartus, Model M. 
Built mebbe two hunderd 
years ago in Concordiat 
times. Packs a wallop, too. I’ll 
tell ye.” 

The tank wheeled, brought 
a gun muzzle to bear in the 
base of the tower. 

“Send ’em out,” the speaker 
growled. “Or I blast ’em out.” 

“One round in here, and 
I’ve had a wasted trip,” Re- 
tief said. “I’d better go out.” 

“Wait a minute. Mister,” 
Chip said. **l got the glimmer- 
in’s of a idear.” 

“I’ll stall them,” Tove said. 
He keyed the mike. 

“ACI 228, what’s your au-

thority for this demand?^ 

"‘I know that machine/* 
Chip said. “My hobby, old- 
time fightin’ machines. Built 
a model of a Resartus once, 
inch to the foot. A beauty. 
Now, lessee...” 

VII 

T he icy wind blew snow 
crystals stingingly against 
Retief’s face. 

“Keep your hands in your 
pockets, Chip,” he said. 
“Numb hands won’t hack the 
program.” 

“Yeah.” Chip looked across 
at the tank. “Useta think that 
was a perty thing, that Resar- 
tus/* he said. “Looks mean, 
now.” 

“You’re getting the target’s- 
eye view,” Retief said. “Sorry 
you had to get mixed up in 
this. Old Timer.” 

“Mixed myself in. Burn 
good thing, too.” Chip sighed. 
“I like these folks,” he said. 
“Them boys didn’t like lettin* 
us come out here, but I’ll give 
’em credit. They seen it had to 
be this way, and they didn’t 
set to moanin’ about it.” 

“They’re tough people. 
Chip.” 

“Funny how it sneaks up on 
you, ain’t it, Mister? Few min- 
utes ago we was eatin’ high on 
the hog. Now we’^re right close 
to bein’ dead men.” 

“They want us alive. Chip.” 
“It’ll be a hairy deal. Mis- 
ter,” Chip said. “But t’hell 
with it. If it works, it works.” 
“That’s the spirit.” 



“I hope I got them fields o’ 
fire right — ” 

“Don't worry. I’ll bet a bar- 
rel of beer we make it.” 

“We’ll find out in about ten 
seconds,” Chip said. 

As they reached the tank, 
the two men broke stride and 
jumped. Retief leaped for the 
gun barrel, swung up astride 
it, ripped off the fur-lined 
leather cap he wore and, lean- 
ing forward, jammed it into 
the bore of the cannon. The 
chef sprang for a perch above 
the fore scanner antenna. 
With an angry whuff! anti- 
personnel charges slammed 
from apertures low on the 
sides of the vehicle. Retief 
swung around, pulled himself 
up on the hull. 

“Okay, Mister,” Chip called. 
“I’m going under.” He slipped 
down the front of the tank, 
disappeared between the 
treads. Retief clambered up, 
took a position behind the 
turret, lay flat as it whirled 
angrily, sonar eyes searching 
for its tormentors. The vehi- 
cle shuddejred, backed, 
stopped, moved forward, piv- 
oted. 

Chip reappeared at the 
front of the tank. 

“It’s stuck,” he called. He 
stopped to breathe hard, clung 
as the machine lurched for- 
ward, spun to the right, 
stopped, rocking slightly. 

“Take over here,” Retief 
said. He crawled forward, 
watched as the chef pulled 
himself up, slipped down past 
him, feeling for the footholds 



28

between the treads. He 
reached the ground, dropped 
on his back, hitched himself 
under the dark belly of the 
tank. He groped, found the 
handholds, probed with a foot 
for the tread-jack lever. 

The tank rumbled, backed 
quickly, turned left and right 
in a dizzying sine curve. Re- 
tief clung grimly, inches from 
the clashing treads. 

The machine ground to a 
halt. Retief found the lever, 
braced his back, pushed. The 
lever seemed to give minutely. 
He set himself again, put both 
feet against the frozen bar and 
heaved. 

With a dry rasp, it slid 
back. Imniediately two heavy 
rods extended themselves, 
moved down to touch the 
pavement, grated. The left 
track creaked as the weight 
went off it. Suddenly the 
tank’s drive raced, and Retief 
grabbed for a hold as the right 
tread clashed, heaved the fif- 
ty-ton machine forward. The 
jacks screeched as they scored 
the tarmac, then bit in. The 
tank pivoted, chips of pave- 
ment flying. The jacks ex- 
tended, lifted the clattering 
left track clear of the surface 
as the tank spun like a ham- 
strung buffalo. 

The tank stopped, sat silent, 
canted now on the extended 
jacks. Retief emerged from 
under the machine, jumped, 
pulled himself above the anti- 
personnel apertures as anoth- 
er charge rocked the tank. He 
clambered to the turret. 



crouched beside Chip. They 
waited, watching the entry 
hatch. 

Five minutes passed. 

‘T’ll bet Old Tony’s givin’ 
the chauffeur hell,” Chip said. 

The hatch cycled open. A 
head came cautiously into 
view in time to see the needier 
in Retiefs hand. 

“Come on out,” Retief said. 

The head dropped. Chip 
snaked forward to ram a short 
section of steel rod under the 
hatch near the hinge. The 
hatch began to cycle shut, 
groaned, stopped. There was a 
sound of metal failing, and 
the hatch popped open. 

Retief half rose, aimed the 
needier. The walls of the tank 
rang as the metal splinters 
ricocheted inside. 

“That’s one keg o’ beer I 
owe you. Mister,” Chip said. 
“Now let’s git outa here be- 
fore the ship lifts and fries 
us.” 

biggest problem the 
Jorgensen’s people will 
have is decontaminating the 
wreckage,” Retief said. 

Magnan leaned forward. 
“Amazing,” he said. “They 
just keep coming, did they? 
Had they no inter-ship com- 
munication?” 

“They had their orders,’' 
Retief said. “And their attack 
plan. They followed it.” 

“What a spectacle,” Magnan 
said. “Over a thousand ships, 
plunging out of control one 
by one as they entered the 
stress-field.” 



THE FROZEN PLANET

‘‘Not much of a spectacle,” 
Retief said. “You couldn’t see 
them. Too far away. They all 
crashed back in the moun- 
tains.” 

“Oh.” Magnan’s face fell. 
“But it’s as well they did. The 
bacterial bombs — ” 

“Too cold for bacteria. 
They won’t spread.” 

“Nor will the Soetti,” Mag- 
nan said smugly, “thanks to 
the promptness with which I 
acted in dispatching you with 
the requisite data.” He looked 
narrowly at Retief. “By the 
way, you’re sure no. .ah. 
message reached you after 
your arrival?” 

“I got something,” Retief 
said, looking Magnan in the 
eye. “It must have been a gar- 
bled transmission. It didn’t 
make sense.” 

Magnan coughed, shuffled 
papers. “This information 
you’ve reported,” he said hur- 
riedly. “This rather fantastic 
story that the Soetti originat- 
ed in the Cloud, that they’re 
seeking a foothold in the main 
Galaxy because they’ve liter- 
ally eaten themselves but of 
subsistence — how did you get 
it? The one or two Soetti we 
attempted to question, ah ... ” 
Magnan coughed again. 
“There was an accident,” he 
finished. “We got nothing 
from them.” 

“The Jorgensens have a 
rather special method of in- 
terrogating prisoners,” Retief 
said. “They took one from a 
wreck, still alive but uncon- 
scious. They managed to get 

30 



the story from him. He died 
of it.” 

“It’s immaterial, actually,” 
Magnan said. “Since the So- 
etti violated their treaty with 
us the day after it was signed. 
Had no intention of fair play. 
Far from evacuating the 
agreed areas, they had actual- 
ly occupied half a dozen addi- 
tional minor bodies in the 
Whate system.” 

Retief clucked sympatheti- 
cally. 

“You don’t know who to 
trust, these days,” he said. 

Magnan looked at him cold- 

ly- 

“Spare me your sarcasm, 
Mr. Retie f,” he said. He 
picked up a folder from his 
desk, opened it. “By the way, 
I have another little task for 
you, Retief. We haven’t had a 
comprehensive wild-life cen\ 
sus report from Brimstone 
lately—” 

“Sorry,” Retief said. “I’ll be 
tied up. I’m taking a month 
off. Maybe more.” 

“What’s that ?” Magnan’s 
head came up. “You seem to 
forget — ” 

“I’m trying, Mr. Council- 
lor,” Retief said. “Good-by 
now.” He reached out and 
flipped the key. Magnan’s 
face faded from the screen. 
Retief stood up. 

“Chip,” he said, “we’ll crack 
that keg when I get back.” He 
turned to Anne-Marie. 

“How long,” he said, “do 
you think it will take you to 
teach me to ski by moon- 
light?” TND

MIRROR 

IMAGE 



By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



T he thin trembling man 
leaned forward tensely in 
his chair, his face drawn. His 
eyes, set deep in their sockets, 
were dull and expressionless. 
Yet they were oddly alive 
with an irrepressible anxiety. 

“IVe got to get back.” His 
voice was a grim whisper and 
his hands went white at the 
knuckles where they clung to 
the armrests as he tried to 
rise. 

Two men, dressed in the 
short-sleeved, white uniform 
of the institution, stepped for- 
ward ominously. 

Shuddering, the man sank 
back hopelessly into the chair. 

Across the desk Dr. James 
Stanton studied him intently 
— for the moment disregard- 
ing the two older men who 



sat on the doctor’s right and 
left. “Perhaps, Professor 
Yardley,” Stanton said pleas- 
antly, “you will be allowed to 
return home — ^after we have 
finished our business here.” 

Yardley’s lips tightened. 
“You have no intention of let- 
ting me go back to my lab- 
oratory.” His pleading voice 
became acid. “But you can't 
keep me here!'* 

Leaning back in a chair that 
creaked under h i s broad 
frame, Dr. Justin Leonard 
smiled patiently and raised a 
bushy eyebrow. “There may 
be disastrous consequences if 
we don’t release you. Profes- 
sor?” 

Yardley sighed forlornly 
but his tone was strong, his 
words resonant with sinceri- 



31 





ty. ^"Thc consequences;, sir, 
are unimaginable!** 

yourself?” Dr. Dennis 
Morgan, stout and bespecta- 
cled, leaned forward. ”To us? 
Or to the world in general. 
Professor?” 

Yardley ran a hand through 
his sparse white hair and 
dropped his gaze to the floor. 
^‘You’ll never let me go,” he 
muttered. His eyes darted ac- 
cusingly from one observer to 
the other. ‘‘You’re a commis- 
sion, aren’t you? You’re to de- 
cide whether I’m mad! You’re 
sitting in judgment on me!” 

His gaze leaped from Stan- 
ton to the middle-aged woman 
who sat against the wall, her 
hands folded prudently in her 
lap. “You’re responsible, 
Lydia!” he accused. “You ar- 
ranged this!” 

“Now, Uncle Baldwin,” the 
woman answered indulgently, 
“we’re only doing what we 
think best.” 

He turned to Stanton. 
“Don’t you understand her 
motivation, doctor? I’m a 
wealthy man. I like to pursue 
scientific truths, no matter 
how unorthodox they may 
seem. I spend considerable 
money for equipment for my 
basement laboratory — ^money 
which might otherwise even- 
tually pass on to my niece 
and nephew. But they don’t 
want to wait! They — ” 

“Please, Professor.” Stan- 
ton was reproving. “You 
mustn’t excite yourself.” He 
studied Yardley thoughtfully. 
Then, “All right. Professor. 



I’ll be candid. We are a sanity 
commission. We will decide 
your degree of mental fitness. 
Now, hadn’t you better co-op- 
erate?” 

Yardley relaxed. The two 
guards relaxed with him. “All 
right, then,” he said submis- 
sively, “if there’s no other 
way. 

“Fine !” Stanton smiled 
warmly. “N o v/, I under- 
stand — ” 

“Do you have a mirror?” 
the professor cut in. 

“A mirror?” 

“Yes, any reflecting surface 
will do.” 

Stanton looked wary. 

Yardley explained, “A sim- 
ple demonstration may save a 
good deal of time.” 

Stanton cleared his throat. 
“I’m afraid we shall have to 
stick to procedure. Now, I un- 
derstand— rather, your niece 
tells me — that you have dedi- 
cated a good many years to 
the investigation of a certain 
theory.” 

“Thirty years.” 

“Will you tell us about it. 
Professor.” It was a directive, 
not a question. 

“As I have already said, it’s 
unorthodox and you’ll prob- 
ably—” 

“The theory. Professor,” 
Stanton insisted. 

“Very well.” Yardley yield- 
ed, his words hollow with res- 
ignation. “Our world is co- 
existent with another. For 
every particle on this side — 
no matter how minute or how 
large— there is an identical 



32 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




particle on the other. For eve- 
ry individual, every animal, 
every force here, there is a 
counterpart in the other 
world.*' 

S TANTON'S frown became 
a half-smile. Lydia Frame’s 
did not. They traded glances. 
‘•The mirrors, uncle,” Lydia 
suggested eagerly, ‘‘tell them 
about the mirrors like you tell 
everybody else.” 

Yardley stared reproachful- 
ly at her. 

“There is more to the the- 
ory?” Leonard asked. 

'‘More?” Yardley repeated. 
“Much more. As my niece sug- 
gests, I shall tell you about 
mirrors. Reflecting sur- 
faces — his eyes flashed 
eagerly — “are not reflecting 
surfaces at all! There is no 
such thing as looking into a 
mirror and seeing an image 
of yourself! Mirrors are win- 
dows — windows that allow us 
to look into this other world 
which exists in us, around us, 
with us!” He paused, breath- 
ing erratically. 

Stanton exchanged cautious 
glances with the other psy- 
chiatrists. The guards became 
rigidly attentive. 

Yardley went on with more 
vocal restraint. “There is a 
force that exists between the 
reciprocal worlds or planes of 
existence ... a force which 
guarantees that every causal 
effect in this world will be 
duplicated in exactly the same 
space and time, in the oth- 

ft 



“In other words, Stanton 
interrupted, suppressing an 
amused smile, “the force — ” 

“Let me finish!” Yardley 
cut in. “The reciprocal nature 
of the force determines that 
if you write a letter in this 
world your counterpart will 
write a letter in the other. If 
you walk in front of a mirror 
in this plane, the other you 
will do the same thing in the 
other plane. If you leave this 
building and proceed to an- 
other to stare into a new mir- 
ror your duplicate will do the 
same thing simultaneously.” 

One of the guards snick- 
ered, then shrank visibly and 
resumed his srtrem expression 
under Stanton’s reprimanding 
glare. 

“Does this have anything to 
do,” Dr. Morgan asked, “with 
the — er — contraption you 
built in your basement?” 

“Make him tell you about 
it, doctor,” Lydia begged. 

The door opened behind 
Stanton as a young blonde girl 
came in with a bulging file 
folder and deposited it on the 
desk. 

Yardley staring through the 
open door, sprang to his feet. 
The guards seized his arms. 

Stanton turned to follow the 
professor’s incredulous stare 
into the other room. Yardley’s 
eyes were locked on a full- 
length mirror that reflected 
his own erratic motions as he 
attempted to break free from 
his captors. 

But they held on grimly 

and he went limp^. “Good

Lord V* he exclaimed hopeless- 
ly. “They’ve got Yardley over 
there too!” 

Unperturbed by the episode 
the blonde casually left the 
office, closing the door after 
her. The guards lowered the 
professor into his chair. 

“You’ve got to take me back 
to the laboratory!” Yardley 
begged Stanton. “Don’t you 
see that with both of us cap- 
tured there’s no one left to—” 

“The contraption, Profes- 
sor,” Stanton reminded him. 

Yardley sighed and his 
shoulders sagged. “Yes, I 
built what my niece calls a 
'contraption.’ ” 

“Two of them,” Lydia cor- 
rected. “Two contraptions and 
the mirror, uncle. Tell them 
about it.” 

“Mirror?” Stanton ques- 
tioned. 

“Yes,” Lydia explained. 
“One entire wall of the base- 
ment is a mirror. That piece 
of glass must have cost thou- 
sands. It’s a single pane. Had 
to tear out the side of the 
house to install it.” 

Stanton returned his atten- 
tion to the professor. “What 
are these contraptions?” 

D isturbed, Yardley ran 

bony fingers through his 
hair. “Twenty years, doctor,” 
he began emotionally. “It took 
twenty years to detect the 
presence of the force, another 
five years to study it and an- 
other five to learn how to 
modify it.” 

“And now,” Morgan sug- 



gested, “you have mastered 
the force which insures that 
articles and actions will be 
duplicated between the two 
worlds?” He made a vain at- 
tempt to hide his smile. 

Yardley shook his head. 
“Control it? No. Affect it? 
Yes. I learned that I could dis- 
rupt the force. By erecting a 
counter-field, I found I could 
effect actions in this world 
that were entirely independ- 
ent of actions in the other. 
This counter-force made it 
possible for me to light a 
cigarette here and discover 
that in the other plane — the 
one seen beyond the mirror— 
I hadn’t quite finished the 
previous cigarette . had 
evidently decided to take one 
more puff.” 

The guard nearer Yardley 
laughed again. This time 
Stanton made no attempt to 
constrain him. 

“You mean,” Stanton asked, 
“that your image in the mir- 
ror did not reflect your ac- 
tions?” 

“Crudely put that’s what 
happened,” Yardley replied. 
“But it required many experi- 
ments before I detected any 
such result. You see, even 
though at one particular in- 
stant the force might be dis- 
rupted, freeing me and the 
other Baldwin Yardley from 
reciprocating motions, it re- 
quired several hours before 
the divergency of our move- 
ments across the mirror be- 
came perceptible. 

“We speculated on the 



34 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




cause. And we decided we 
were such exact duplicates, 
with identical reflexes and re- 
sponses, that even though we 
suddenly became mutually in- 
dependent, several hours 
would probably pass before 
one of us acted in an unchar- 
acteristic manner — like im- 
pulsively extinguishing a 
cigarette prematurely.’’ 

Leonard rose. ‘‘Really, Dr. 
Stanton, is it necessary to con- 
tinue? I have another appoint- 
ment — ” he withdrew his 
fountain pen — “and I believe 
I’m quite ready to sign the 
form.” 

Yardley sprang up, then sat 
down again as the guards 
moved toward him. “You’ve 
got to believe me!” he shout- 
ed. “Good God, Stanton ! 
They’ve got to believe one of 
us Yardleys!” 

Stanton motioned Leonard 
back into his chair. “If we 
don*t believe you. Professor 
... then what?” 

“Sir,” Yardley suggested 
gravely, “would you enjoy 
meeting yourself on the 
street? Finding yourself in- 
volved in an argument with 
two identical women, each 
claiming to be your wife? 
Can’t you appreciate what 
would happen? Millions 
would suffer unbearable men- 
tal harassment in the grim re- 
alization that a mirror does 
more than reflect images ! The 
world would develop a phobia 
toward mirrors. Then, when 
the two worlds found out that 
entry was mutually possible. 



each would become the limit- 
less victim of the other’s 
vices. 

“Wouldn’t it be simple to 
murder an enemy, flee to the 
other world and let authorities 
wrangle hopelessly over the 
identity of the actual murder- 
er? And might not the Paris 
in this world assume that it 
was the rightful capital not 
only of this world’s France 
but also of the other world’s? 
Wars would start twice as 
easily, be twice as horrible 
and — ” 

“Am I to understand,” Dr. 
Morgan asked, smiling, “that 
you’ve found means of — er — 
walking through mirrors. Par- 
don — ^windows?” 

Y 'ARDLEY went rigid with 
•resentment. “You’re hu- 
moring me — all of you! Well, 
let me recount a recent 
experiment — number thirty- 
eight of the current series. 

“I activated the dissonance 
crystal and waited for the 
charges to build up. As I stood 
patiently beside the amplifi- 
cation lenses, I stared at the 
Yardley in the mirror. 

“He stared back at me. 
Then, suddenly he raised his 
hand and scratched his cheek ! 
Mind you, he did this before 
the charge in the crystal had 
built up sufficiently to throw 
the inter-world force out of 
rhythm ! 

“That could mean only one 
thing — diverse movement was 
actually independent of sub- 
sequent exposures to the crys- 



MIRROR IMAGE 



35 




ta! after the initial exposure! 
In simple terms — a single ex- 
posure is all that is needed 
to interrupt the force perma- 
nently. After that exposure it 
is possible for Yardley One 
and Yardley Two to continue 
acting independently! 

‘^Furthermore any material 
object with which Yardley 
One or Yardley Two come 
into contact is also permanent- 
ly removed from the field of 
reciprocating forces. I found 
that out in experiment thirty- 
nine, after turning off the 
ceiling light in the basement. 
Later a man from the equip- 
ment supply company made a 
delivery. He turned on the 
overhead light. But the re- 
f lection o£ the bulb in the 
mirror did not light up! What 
is more serious is the fact that 
as a result of the man’s con- 
tact with the affected light 
switch he will eventually be 
affected too, as will every ob- 
ject he comes in contact with! 
It’s a chain reaction.” 

Leonard and Morgan looked 
at each other in evident an- 
noyance. But Stanton contin- 
ued to stare reservedly at the 
professor. 

Yardley went on. “But back 
to experiment number thirty- 
eight, which I’m sure you gen- 
tlemen will find most fas- 
cinating. I had just — and I 
might add needlessly — acti- 
vated the crystal and had ob- 
served that the other Yardley 
was already displaying inde- 
pendent movement. Confused, 
I walked over to the mirror. 



He approached his own mir- 
ror too. 

“‘Did you notice it?’ I 
asked. 

“‘The free motion?’ he an- 
swered. ‘Yes, I noticed. Yard- 
ley, I’m afraid.’ 

“ ‘That the field might not 
have to be rebuilt each time 
we want to act independent- 
ly? That, once activated, our 
divergent natures might con- 
tinue independent of further 
field stimulation?’ 

“ ‘Then you’ve been think- 
ing about it too,’ he said with 
something like consternation. 

“ ‘I’m afraid so,’ I answered. 
‘And I’m frightened.’ 

“Reciprocating insects 
buzzed around each of our 
heads, landed on our cheeks. 
We both slapped. I’m afraid 
the other Yardley was faster 
— his reflexes were a bit more 
accurate. He killed his insect. 
I missed mine. 

“The surviving jnosquito or 
whatever it was darted toward 
the mirror. It flew through the 
mirror r 

The professor was momen- 
tarily silent, staring at each 
of the psychiatrists in turn. 
“We hadn’t even considered 
the possibility that beside be- 
ing windows between the 
v/orlds, mirrors might also be 
doors,” he continued. “I’m 
afraid that we were both 
stunned by the realization. 

“But the other Yardley re- 
covered first. He seized an or- 
nate stiletto on his desk and 
hurled it at the mirror. It 
came through! Landed at my 



36 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




feet. Then he stepped through 
— into our world!” 

Stanton absently thumbed 
through a stack of papers on 
his desk, his chin resting on 
the back of his other hand. 

“Naturally,” Yardley went 
on, “we were elated at the dis- 
covery. We could see only the 
beneficial results. Two worlds 
with the possibility of an in- 
terchange of knowledge that 
each would acquire individual- 
ly as the divergent develop- 
ment continued after we built 
a door powerful enough to en- 
compass the entire world. 

“But I’m afraid the beauti- 
ful icing successfully con- 
cealed the awful cake. On fur- 
ther thought, we arrived in- 
dependently at the decision 
that contact would never be 
feasible — that the best course 
was for us to destroy the crys- 
tals and lenses and allow eve- 
rything to return to normal. 

“Sadly, we burned our notes 
and disconnected lenses and 
crystals. We left only the 
hulls of consoles which had 
housed priceless equipment.” 

Yardley compressed his 
lips. “But that did not return 
conditions to normal, gentle- 
men. Weeks passed and still 
Yardley and I were independ- 
ent of each other — were show- 
ing no indications of being 
drawn back into the bi-uni- 
versal design of reciprocity! 
And further experimentation 
proved the more horrible 
truth : 

“Objects with which we 
came in contact were immedi- 



ately being removed from the 
effects of the natural force! 
Lydia bought me a new desk 
lamp. The other Lydia bought 
the other Yardley a new desk 
lamp. The boy from Colfax’s 
Department Store who deliv- 
ered the lamp in our world 
walked out of the door a full 
ten seconds before his image 
left the basement wall mirror ! 
When he returned the next 
day with a replacement for 
the dented base his image did 
not return at all!” 

4^TTE didn’t notice it?” 

Ax Stanton asked, humor- 
ingly. 

“I was behind the mirror 
housing at the time,” Yard- 
ley explained. “He couldn’t 
see my reflection. My over- 
head light was on, but the 
other Yardley’s wasn’t. I guess 
the boy thought the reflection 
was really an extension of the 
room. 

“The other Yardley and I 
discussed the matter immedi- 
ately with grave concern. And 
we were fortunate. By pool- 
ing our mental resources, we 
were able to design the coun- 
ter-field— or reverse-image — 
reflectors, 

“By building a powerful 
counter-activator we felt we 
would meet with success by 
flooding the entire area with 
sufficiently strong vibrations 
to rock ourselves and the ob- 
jects we had come in contact 
with back into the reciprocity 
design. Wc' would then de- 
stroy all the equipment and

discontinue the experiments/' 

Stanton asked patiently, 
“And this other activator — 
did it work?" 

“You fool!" Yardley rose 
shaking. “Don't you realize 
that's the reason I must get 
back to the laboratory? Yard- 
ley and I had barely complet- 
ed our work when your 
strong-arm men came bursting 
in." 

There was silence in the 
room. 

“Will you let me go back 
home?" Yardley begged. “Just 
for a day! That's all I ask! 
Just long enough time to ac- 
tivate the counter-reflectors. 
Lord, man — you’ve got to ! 
Just think — each object I 
came in contact with will 
come in contact with other 
objects and those will influ- 
ence still others in an end- 
less chain reaction. It may 
take a few days — but soon 
there'll be pandemonium! And 
it will spread. It may take 
year s — even centuries — but 
eventually the whole world 
will be freed from the force 
that insures reciprocity!" 

“I'm afraid, dear uncle," 
Lydia said mildly, “that even 
if they did allow you to re- 
turn home, you'd find things 
quite different in the base- 
ment." 

“No!" he shouted hoarsely. 

“Yesterday, just after you 
were taken away, the car- 
penters and moving men came. 
They removed the mirror 
first, then your other contrap- 
tions. Really, uncle, the base- 



ment will make an excellent 
rumpus room — after they get 
it all cleared out.” 

The professor shook uncon- 
trollably. “You've got to let 
me get more equipment!” he 
begged Stanton. “The coun- 
ter-reflector must be rebuilt !” 

The guards stood close to 
him, on the alert. Stanton 
merely stared pityingly. The 
blonde entered again and 
walked toward the desk with 
another folder. 

“If I can prove it," Yardley 
demanded eagerly, “will you 
let me go back?" 

Before Stanton could reply 
the professor reached into his 
inner coat pocket and with- 
drew a stiletto. The guards 
dived for his arm. The blonde 
and Lydia screamed in shrill 
duet. 

But Yardley had already 
thrust his hand back over his 
shoulder. He hurled the dag- 
ger forward. Stanton ducked. 
The blade flew well over his 
head and into the reception 
room. 

“Take him, boys,” Stanton 
directed. 

The sound of shattering 
glass came from the outer of- 
fice. 

“Damned good thing you 
ducked," said Leonard to 
Stanton as one of the guards 
locked Yardley's arms behind 
him and the other plunged a 
hypodermic needle into the 
wrinkled skin of his neck. 

“You don't understand!" 
Yardley gasped, falling back 
into the chair. “I was only 



38 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




showing that the stiletto 
would go through the mirror. 
It was the one that the other 
— Yardley — threw to me.” 

His head lolled forward and 
he braced himself in the chair 
with difficulty. 

‘Tools!” Yardley rasped 
weakly, casting dazed eyes in 
their general direction. “Don’t 
understand ... periods of 
fluctuation . happens once 
in a while . when force 
slips back toward resonance 
, . happened often at first 
. rare now . soon perma- 
nent dissonance ...” 

His chin fell on his chest 
and one of the attendants 
caught him to prevent his fall- 
ing from the chair. 

The guard said, “This bird 
had an answer for every- 
thing.” 

Lydia rose and pressed a 
handkerchief to the inner cor- 
ners of her eyes^ although it 
was obvious to everyone that 
there was no moisture there. 
“Will he be all right, doc- 
tor?” she asked solicitously. 

“As well as can be expected. 
We will send him to surgery 
immediately. There will be a 
simple leucotomy— an incision 
into the prefrontal lobe of the 
brain. You and your husband 
have already signed the nec- 
essary papers.” 

“I know, but how — how will 
it affect him?” 

“Oh, he’ll be quite all right 
—physically. There will be 
inunediate relief of the psy- 
chasthenia. And in a few days 
he will be able to return home. 
MIRROR IMAGE 



However, you will find him 
rather simple mentally. His 
personality will be gone, but 
he will not be a menace. I’m 
afraid he’ll require the con- 
stant attention of a nurse, 
though.” 

“I understand. Doctor Stan- 
ton.” Lydia wiped her dry 
eyes again and left. 

'^HE guards placed the pro- 
fessor on a table that was 
wheeled into the room and 
pushed him out a side en- 
trance. 

Stanton returned to the 
work at his desk. 

Ten minutes later there was 
another buzz. “You’re wanted 
in the clinic, doctor. There’s 
a delivery boy from one of 
the department stores who is 
quite uncontrollable.” 

“Tell them I’ll be there 
shortly,” he instructed absent- 
ly, somewhat annoyed at the 
interruption. 

Shortly after he walked into 
the outer office. The stiletto 
lay on the floor in front of 
the cracked and broken mir- 
ror. An irregularly shaped 
area of glass reflected only 
part of his image, the broken 
edge slicing across his hip and 
severing one of his legs. 

He smiled wearily. The 
image smiled back. 

“That was one hell of a 
case!” Stanton muttered, put- 
ting on his hat. 

The reflection paused to 
wipe the sweat band in his 
hat and nodded agreeably. 
“Damned if it wasn’t.” END

They weren't human. They were something

By LESTER DEL REY *^HE Starship Pandora 

A creaked and groaned as 
her landing pads settled un- 
evenly in the mucky surface 
of the ugly world outside. She 
seemed to be restless to end 
her fool's errand here, two 
hundred light years from the 
waiting hordes on Earth. 
Straining metal plates 
twanged and echoed through 
her hallways. 

Captain Gwayne cursed and 
rolled over, reaching for his 
boots. He was a big, rawboned 
man, barely forty ; but ten 
years of responsibility had 
pressed down his shoulders 
and put age-feigning hollows 
under his reddened eyes. The 
starlanes between Earth and 
her potential colonies were 



40 



LESTER DEL REY 




rough on the men who trav- 
eled them now. He shuffled 
toward the control room, 
grumbling at the heavy gravi- 
ty. 

Lieutenant Jane Corey 
looked up, nodding a blonde 
head at him as he moved to- 
ward the ever-waiting pot of 
murky coffee. ‘'Morning, Bob. 
You need a shave.” 

“Yeah.” He swallowed the 
hot coffee without tasting it, 
then ran a hand across the 
dark stubble on his chin. It 
could wait. “Anything new 
during the night?” 

“About a dozen blobs held 
something like a convention 
a little ways north of us. They 
broke up about an hour ago 
and streaked off into the 
clouds.” The blobs were a pe- 
culiarity of this planet about 
which nobody knew anything. 
They looked like overgrown 
fireballs, but seemed to have 
an almost sentient curiosity 
about anything moving on the 
ground. “And our two cadets 
sneaked out again. Barker fol- 
lowed them, but lost them in 
the murk. IVe kept a signal 
going to guide them back.” 

Gwayne swore softly to 
himselL Earth couldn't turn 
out enough starmen in the 
schools, so promising kids 
were being shipped out for 
training as cadets on their 
twelfth birthday. The two he'd 
drawn, Kaufman and Pinelli, 
seemed to be totally devoid of 
any sense of caution. 

Of course there was no ob- 



vious need for caution here. 
The blobs hadn’t seemed dan- 
gerous, and the local animals 
were apparently all herbivor- 
ous and harmless. They were 
ugly enough, looking like in- 
sects in spite of their internal 
skeletons, with anywhere from 
four to twelve legs each on 
their segmented bodies. None 
acted like dangerous beasts. 

But something had hap- 
pened to the exploration party 
fifteen years back, and to the 
more recent ship under Hen- 
nessy that was sent to check 
up. 



H e turned to the port to 
stare out at the planet. 
The Sol-type sun must be ris- 
ing, since there was a dim 
light. But the thick clouds 
that wrapped the entire world 
diffused its rays into a haze. 
For a change, it wasn't rain- 
ing, though the ground was 
covered by thick swirls of fog. 
In the distance, the tops of 
shrubs that made a scrub for- 
est glowed yellow-green. Mo- 
tions around them suggested 
a herd of feeding animals. De- 
tails were impossible to see 
through the haze. Even the 
deep gorge where they'd 
found Hennessy's carefully 
buried ship was completely 
hidden by the fog. 

There were three of the 
blobs dancing about over the 
grazing animals now, as they 
often seemed to do. Gwayne 
stared at them for a minute, 
trying to read sense into the 



SPAWNING GROUND 



41 




things. If he had time to study 
them. 

But there was no time. 

Earth had ordered him to 
detour here, after leaving his 
load of deep-sleep stored col- 
onists on Official World 71, 
to check on any sign of Hen- 
nessy. He’d been here a week 
longer than he should have 
stayed already. If there was 
no sign in another day or so 
of what had happened to the 
men who’d deserted their ship 
and its equipment, he'd have 
to report back. 

He would have left before, 
if a recent landslip hadn't ex- 
posed enough of the buried 
ship for his metal locators to 
spot fro-m the air by luck. It 
had obviously been hidden 
deep enough to foil the de- 
tectors originally. 

“Bob!” Jane Corey's voice 
cut through his pondering. 
“Bob, there are the kids!” 

Before he could swing to 
follow her pointing finger, 
movement caught his eye. 

The blobs had left the herd. 
Now the three were streaking 
at fantastic speed to a spot 
near the ship, to hover excit- 
edly above something that 
moved there. 

He saw the two cadets then, 
heading back to the waiting 
ship, just beyond the move- 
ment he'd seen through the 
mist. 

Whatever was making the 
fog swirl must have reached 
higher ground. Something be- 
gan to heave upwards. It was 



too far to see clearly, but 
Gwayne grabbed the micro- 
phone, yelling into the radio 
toward the cadets. 

They must have seen what- 
ever it was just as the call 
reached them. Young Kauf- 
man grabbed at Pinelli, and 
they swung around together. 

Then the mists cleared. 

Under the dancing blobs, a 
horde of things was heading 
for the cadets. Shaggy heads, 
brute bodies vaguely man- 
like ! One seemed to be al- 
most eight feet tall, leading 
the others directly toward the 
spacesuited cadets. Some of 
the horde were carrying spears 
or sticks. There was a mo- 
mentary halt, and then the 
leader lifted one arm, as if 
motioning the others forward. 

^^^ET the jeeps out!” 
Gwayne yelled at Jane. 
He yanked the door of the 
little officers’ lift open and 
jabbed the down button. It 
was agonizingly slow, but 
faster than climbing down. He 
ripped the door back at the 
e;dt deck. Men were dashing 
in, stumbling around in con- 
fusion. But someone was tak- 
ing over now — one of the crew 
women. The jeeps were lin- 
ing up. One, at the front, was 
stuttering into life, and 
Gwayne dashed for it as the 
exit port slid back. 

There was no time for suits 
or helmets. The air on the 
planet was irritating and vile 
smelling, but it could be

LESTER DEL REY 




breathed. He leaped to the 
seat, to see that the driver was 
Doctor Barker. At a gesture, 
the jeep rolled down the 
ramp, grinding its gears into 
second as it picked up speed. 
The other two followed. 

There was no sign of the 
cadets at first. Then Gwayne 
spotted them, surrounded by 
the menacing horde. Seen 
from here, the things looked 
horrible in a travesty of man- 
hood. 

The huge leader suddenly 
waved and pointed toward the 
jeeps that were racing toward 
him. He made a fantastic leap 
backwards. Others swung 
about, two of them grabbing 
up the cadets. The jeep was 
doing twenty miles an hour 
now, but the horde began to 
increase the distance, in spite 
of the load of the two strug- 
gling boys ! The creatures 
dived downward into lower 
ground, beginning to disap- 
pear into the mists. 

‘‘Follow the blobs," Gwayne 
yelled. He realized now he’d 
been a fool to leave his suit; 
the radio would have let him 
keep in contact with the kids. 
But it was too late to go back. 

The blobs danced after the 
horde. Barker bounced the 
jeep downward into a gorge. 
Somewhere the man had 
learned to drive superlative- 
ly; but he had to slow as the 
fog thickened lower down. 

Then it cleared to show the 
mob of creatures doubling 
back on their own trail to con- 
fuse the pursuers. 

SPAWNING GROUND 



There was no time to stop. 
The jeep plowed through 
them. Gwayne had a glimpse 
of five-foot bodies tumbling 
out of the way. Monstrously 
coarse faces were half hidden 
by thick hair. A spear 
crunched against the wind- 
shield from behind, and 
Gwayne caught it before it 
could foul the steering wheel. 
It had a wickedly beautiful 
point of stone. 

The creatures vanished as 
Barker fought to turn to fol- 
low them. The other jeeps 
were coming up, by the sound 
of their motors, but too late 
to help. They’d have to get 
to the group with the cadets 
in a hurry or the horde would 
all vanish in the uneven 
ground, hidden by the fog. 

A blob dropped down, al- 
most touching Gwayne. 

He threw up an instinctive 
hand. There was a tingling 
as the creature seemed to pass 
around it. It lifted a few inch- 
es and drifted off. 

Abruptly, Barker’s foot 
ground at the brake. Gwayne 
jolted forward against the 
windshield, just as he made 
out the form of the eight-foot 
leader. The thing was stand- 
ing directly ahead of him, 
a cadet on each shoulder. 

The wheels locked and the 
jeep slid protestingly for- 
ward. The creature leaped 
back. But Gwayne was out of 
the jeep before it stopped, 
diving for the figure. It 
dropped the boys with a sur- 
prised grunt. 



43 




T he arms were thin and 
grotesque below the mas- 
sively distorted shoulders, but 
amazingly strong. Gwayne 
felt them wrench at him as 
his hands locked on the thick 
throat. A stench of alien flesh 
was in his nose as the thing 
fell backwards. Doc Barker 
had hit it seconds after the 
captain’s attack. Its head hit 
rocky ground with a dull, 
heavy sound, and it collapsed. 
Gwayne eased back slowly, 
but it made no further move, 
though it was still breathing. 

Another jeep had drawn up, 
and men were examining the 
cadets. Pinelli was either 
laughing or crying, and Kauf- 
man was trying to break free 
to kick at the monster. But 
neither had been harmed. The 
two were loaded onto a jeep 
while men helped Barker and 
Gwayne stow the bound mon- 
ster on another before heading 
back. 

'‘No sign of skull fracture. 
My God, what a tough brute !” 
Barker shook his own head, 
as if feeling the shock of the 
monster’s landing. 

'T hope so,” Gwayne told 
him. 'T want that thing to live 
— and you’re detailed to save 
it and revive it. Find out if 
it can make sign language or 
draw pictures. I want to know 
what happened to Hennessy 
and why that ship was buried 
against detection. This thing 
may be the answer.” 

Barker nodded grimly. ‘T’ll 
try, though I can’t risk drugs 
on an alien metabolism.” He 



sucked in on the cigarette he’d 
dug out, then spat sickly. 
Smoke and this air made a 
foul combination. “Bob, it still 
makes no sense. We’ve scoured 
this planet by infra-red, and 
there was no sign of native 
villages or culture. We should 
have found some.” 

“T r o g 1 o d y t'c s, maybe,” 
Gwayne guessed. “Anyhow, 
send for me when you get any- 
thing. I’ve got to get this ship 
back to Earth. We’re over- 
staying our time here al- 
ready.” 

The reports from the cadets 
were satisfactory enough. 
They’d been picked up and 
carried, but no harm had been 
done them. Now they were 
busy being little heroes. 
Gwayne sentenced them to 
quarters as soon as he could, 
knowing their stories would 
only get wilder and less in- 
formative with retelling. 

If they could get any story 
from the captured creature, 
they might save time and be 
better off than trying to dig 
through Hennessy’s ship. 
That was almost certainly 
spoorless by now. The only 
possible answer seemed to be 
that the exploring expedition 
and Hennessy’s rescue group 
had been overcome by the ali- 
ens. 

It was an answer, but it left 
a lot of questions. How could 
the primitives have gotten to 
the men inside Hennessy’s 
ship? Why was its fuel 
dumped? Only men would 
have known how to do that. 



LESTER DEL REY 




And who told these creatures 
that a space ship’s metal find^ 
ers could he fooled by a little 
more than a hundred feet of 
solid rock? They’d buried the 
ship cunningly, and only the 
accidental slippage had un- 
done their work. 

Maybe there would never be 
a full answer, but he had to 
find something — and find it 
fast. Earth needed every 
world she could make remote- 
ly habitable, or mankind was 
probably doomed to extinc- 
tion. 

race had blundered 
A safely through its discov- 
ery of atomic weapons into a 
eace that had lasted two 
undred years. It had man- 
aged to prevent an interplane- 
tary war with the Venus col- 
onists. It had found a drive 
that led to the stars, and 
hadn’t even found intelligent 
life there to be dangerous on 
the few worlds that had cul- 
tures of their own. 

But forty years ago, obser- 
vations from beyond the Solar 
System had finally proved 
that the sun was going to go 
nova. 

It wouldn’t be much of an 
explosion, as such things go— 
but it would render the whole 
Solar System uninhabitable 
for millenia. To survive, man 
had to colonize. 

And there were no worlds 
perfect for him, as Earth had 
been. The explorers went out 
ill desperation to find what 
they could; the terraforming 



teams did what they couM. 
And dien the big starships be- 
gan filling worlds with colo- 
nists, carried in deep sleep to 
conserve space. 

Almost eighty worlds. The 
nearest a four month journey 
from Earth and four more 
months back. 

In another ten years, the 
sun would explode, leaving 
man only on the footholds he 
was trying to dig among other 
solar systems. Maybe some of 
the strange worlds would let 
men spread his seed again. 
Maybe none would be spawn- 
ing grounds for mankind in 
spite of the efforts. Each was 
precious as a haven for the 
race. 

If this world could be used, 
it would be nearer than most. 
If not, as it now seemed, no 
more time could be wasted 
here. 

Primitives could be over- 
come, maybe. It would be 
ruthless and unfair to strip 
them of their world, but the 
first law was survival. 

But how could primitives do 
what these must have done? 

He studied the spear he had 
salvaged. It was on a staff 
made of cemented bits of 
smaller wood from the scrub 
growth, skillfully laminated. 
The point was of delicately 
chipped flint, done as no hu- 
man hand had been able to do 
for centuries. 

"‘Beautiful primitive work,” 
he muttered. 

Jane pulled the coffee cup 
away from her lips and snort-

cd. ‘‘You can see a lot more of 
it out there,” she suggested. 

He went to the port and 
glanced out. About sixty of 
the things were squatting in 
the clearing fog, holding 
lances and staring at the ship. 
They were perhaps a thousand 
yards away, waiting patiently. 
For what? For the return of 
their leader — or for something 
that would give the ship to 
them? 

Gwayne grabbed the phone 
and called Barker. “How’s the 
captive coming?” 

Barker’s voice sounded odd. 

“Physically fine. You can 
see him. But — ” 

Gwayne dropped the phone 
and headed for the little sick 
bay. He swore at Doc for not 
calling him at once, and then 
at himself for not checking up 
sooner. Then he stopped at 
the sound of voices. 

There was the end of a 
question from Barker and a 
thick, harsh growling sound 
that lifted the hair along the 
nape of Gwayne’s neck. Bark- 
er seemed to understand, and 
was making a comment as the 
captain dashed in. 

The captive was sitting on 
the bunk, unbound and oddly 
unmenacing. The thick fea- 
tures were relaxed and yet 
somehow intent. He seemed to 
make some kind of a salute as 
he saw Gwayne enter, and his 
eyes burned up unerringly to- 
ward the device on the offi- 
cer’s cap. 

“Haarroo, C a b b a a n !” the 
thing said. 



<i^APTAIN Gwayne, may I 

^ present your former 
friend. Captain Hennessy?” 
Barker said. There was a grin 
on the doctor’s lips, but his 
face was taut with strain. 

The creature nodded slowly 
and drew something from the 
thick hair on its head. It was 
the golden comePof a captain. 

“He never meatit to hurt the 
kids — just to talk to them,” 
Barker cut in quickly. “I’ve 
got some of the story. He’s 
changed. He can’t talk very 
well. Says they’ve had to 
change the language around to 
make the sounds fit, and he’s 
forgotten how to use what 
normal English he can. But it 
gets easier as you listen. It’s 
Hennessy, all right. I’m cer- 
tain.” 

Gwayne had his own ideas 
on that. It was easy for an ali- 
en to seize on the gold orna- 
ment of a captive earthman, 
even to learn a little English, 
maybe. But Hennessy had 
been his friend. 

“How many barmaids in the 
Cheshire Cat? How many 
pups did your oldest kid’s 
dog have? How many were 
br<^wn ?” 

The lips contorted into 
something vaguely like a 
smile, and the curiously 
shaped fingers that could han- 
dle no human-designed equip- 
ment spread out. 

Three. Seven. Zero. 

The answers were right. 

By the time the session was 
over, Gwayne had begun to 
understand the twisted speech 



46 



LESTER DEL REY 




from inhuman vocal cords bet- 
ter. But the story took a long 
time telling. 

When it was finished, 
Gwayne and Barker sat for 
long minutes in silence. Final- 
ly Gwayne drew a shuddering 
breath and stood up. “Is it 
possible, Do(^?” 

“No,” Barker said flatly. He 
spread his hands and gri- 
maced. “No. Not by what I 
know. But it happened. I’ve 
looked at a few tissues under 
the microscope. The changes 
are there. It’s hard to believe 
about their kids. Adults in 
eight years, but they stay 
shorter. It can’t be a heredi- 
tary change — the things that 
affect the body don’t change 
the germ plasm. But in this 
case, what changed Hennessy 
is real, so maybe the fact that 
the change is passed on is as 
real as he claims.” 

Gwayne led the former 
Hennessy to the exit. The 
waiting blobs dropped down 
to touch the monstrous man, 
then leaped up again. The 
crowd of monsters began mov- 
ing forward toward their 
leader. A few were almost as 
tall as Hennessy, but most 
were not more than five feet 
high. 

The kids of the exploring 
party... 

B ack in the contol room, 
Gwayne found the emer- 
gency release levers, set the 
combinations and pressed the 
studs. There was a hiss and 
gurgle as the great tanks of 

SPAWNING GROUND 



fuel discharged their contents 
out onto the ground where no 
ingenuity could ever recover 
it to bring life to the ship 
again. 

He’d have to tell the men 
and women of the crew later, 
after he’d had time to organ- 
ize things and present it all in 
a way they could accept, how- 
ever much they might hate it 
at first. But there was no put- 
ting off giving the gist of it 
to Jane. 

“It was the blobs,” he sum- 
marized it. “They seem to be 
amused by men. They don’t re- 
quire anything from us, but 
they like us around. Hennessy 
doesn’t know why. They can 
change our cells, adapt us. Be- 
fore men came, all life here 
had twelve legs. Now they’re 
changing that, as we’ve seen. 

“And they don’t have to be 
close to do it. We’ve all been 
outside the hull. It doesn’t 
show yet — but we’re changed. 
In another month. Earth food 
would kill us. We’ve got to 
stay here. We’ll bury the 
ships deeper this time, and 
Earth won’t find us. They 
can’t risk trying a colony 
where three ships vanish, so 
we’ll just disappear. And 
they’ll never know.” 

Nobody would know. Their 
children — odd children wh6 
matured in eight years— would 
be primitive savages in three 
generations. The Earth tools 
would be useless, impossible 
for the hands so radically 
changed. Nothing from the 
ship would last. Books could 

47 




never be read by the new eyes. 
And in time. Earth wouldn't 
even be a memory to this 
world. 

She was silent a long time, 
staring out of the port toward 
what must now be her home. 
Then she sighed. “You'll need 
practice, but the others don't 
know you as well as I do. Bob. 
I guess we can fix it so they'll 
believe it all. And it's too late 
now. But we haven't really 
been changed yet, have we?" 

“No," he admitted. Damn his 
voice ! He'd never been good 
at lying. “No. They have to 
touch us. I’ve been touched, 
but the rest could go back." 

She nodded. He waited for 
the condemnation, but there 
was only puzzlement in her 
face. “Why?" 

And then, before he could 
answer, her ov/n intelligence 
gave her the same answer he 
had found for himself. “The 
spawning ground!" 

It was the only thing they 
could do. Earth needed a place 
to plant her seed, but no world 
other than Earth could ever be 
trusted to preserve that seed 
for generation after genera- 
tion. Some worlds already 
were becoming uncertain. 

Here, though, the blobs had 
adapted men to the alien 
world instead of men having 
to adapt the whole planet to 
their needs. Here, the strange 
children of man's race could 
grow, develop and begin the 
U>ng trek back to civilization. 
The gadgets would be lost for 

48 



a time. But perhaps some of 
the attitudes of civilized man 
would remain to make the 
next rise to culture a better 
one. 

“We're needed here," he 
told her, his voice pleading for 
the understanding he couldn't 
yet fully give himself. “These 
people need as nch a set of 
bloodlines as possible to give 
the new race strength. The 
fifty men and women on this 
ship will be needed to start 
them with a decent chance. 
We can't go to Earth, where 
nobody would believe or ac- 
cept the idea — or even let us 
come back. We have to stay 
here." 

She smiled then and moved 
toward him, groping for his 
strength. “Be fruitful," she 
whispered. “Be fruitful and 
spawn and replenish an earth." 

“No," he told her. “Replen- 
ish the stars." 

But she was no longer lis- 
tening, and that part of his 
idea could wait. 

Some day, though, their 
children would find a way to 
the starlanes again, looking 
for other worlds. With the 
blobs to help them, they could 
adapt to most worlds. The un- 
changed spirit would lead 
them through all space, and 
the changing bodies would 
claim worlds beyond number- 
ing. 

Some day, the whole uni- 
verse would be a spawning 
ground for the children of 
men! END

semi-disk of Jupiter was more Tolliver rammed his fists 

49 




into the side pockets of his 
loose blue uniform jacket. He 
diook his head, grinning re- 
signedly. 

^•You just don't listen to 
me/' he complained. ‘'You 
know I took this piloting job 
just to scrape up money for 
an advanced engineering de- 
gree back on ^rth. I only 
want to finish my year — not 
get into something I can’t 
quit.” 

Jeffers fidgeted in his chair, 
causing it to creak under the 
bulk of his body. It had been 
built for Ganymede, but not 
for Jeffers. 

“Aw, it’s not like that,” the 
manager muttered. “You can 
ease out whenever your con- 
tract’s up. Think we’d bend a 
good orbit on your account?” 

Tolliver stared at him si- 
lently, but the other had dif- 
ficulty meeting his eye. 

“All right, then!” Jeffers 
snapped after a long moment. 
“If you want it that way, ei- 
ther you get in line with us 
or you’re through right now !” 

“You can’t fire me,” retorted 
the pilot pityingly. “I came 
out here on a contract. Five 
hundred credits a week base 
pay, five hundred for haz- 
ardous duty. How else can you 
get pilots out to Jupiter?” 

“Okay I can’t fire you le- 
gally — as long as you report 
for work,” grumbled Jeffers, 
by now a shade more ruddy. 
“We’ll see how long you keep 
reporting. Because you’re off 
the Callisto run as of now! 
Sit in your quarters and see 
50 



if the company calls that haz- 
ardous duty!” 

“Doesn’t matter,” answered 
Tolliver, grinning amiably. 
“The hazardous part is just 
being on the same moon as 
y<m for the next six months.” 
He winked and walked out, 
deliberately leaving the door 
open behind him so as to en- 
joy the incoherent bellowing 
that followed him. 

Looks like a little vacation, 
he thought, unperturbed. He'll 
come around. I just want to 
get back to Earth with a clean 
rep. Let Jeffers and his ^ang 
steal the Great Red Spot off 
Jupiter if they like! It's their 
risk. 

T olliver began to have 
his doubts the next day; 
which was “Tuesday” by the 
arbitrary calender constructed 
to match Ganymede’s week- 
long journey around Jupiter. 

His contract guaranteed a 
pilot’s rating, but someone had 
neglected to specify the type 
of craft to be piloted. 

On the bulletin board, Tol- 
liver’s name stood out beside 
the number of one of the air- 
tight tractors used between 
the dome city and the space- 
port, or for hauling cross- 
country to one of the mining 
domes. 

He soon found that there 
was nothing for him to do but 
hang around the garage in 
case a spaceship should land. 
The few runs to other domes 
seemed to be assigned to driv- 
ers with larger vehicles. 

H. B. FYFE 




The following day was just 
as boring, and the next more 
so. He swore when he found 
the assignment unchanged by 
‘‘Friday.” Even the reflection 
that it was payday was small 
consolation. 

“Hey, Johnny!” said a voice 
at his shoulder. “The word is 
that they’re finally gonna 
trust you to take that creeper 
outside.” 

Tolliver turned to see Red 
Higgins, a regular driver. 

“What do you mean?” 

“They say some home-office 
relative is coming in on the 
Javelinr 

“What’s wrong with that?” 
asked Tolliver. “Outside of 
the way they keep handing 
out soft jobs to nephews, I 
mean.” 

“Aah, these young punks 
just come out for a few 
months so they can go back 
to Earth making noises like 
spacemen. Sometimes there’s 
no reason but them for send- 
ing a ship back with a crew 
instead of in an economy 
orbit. Wait till you see the 
baggage you’ll have to load!” 

Later in the day-period, 
Tolliver recalled this warning. 
Under a portable, double- 
chambered plastic dome blown 
up outside the ship’s airlock, 
a crewman helped him load 
two trunks and a collection of 
bags into the tractor. He was 
struggling to suppress a feel- 
ing of outrage at the waste of 
fuel involved when the home- 
office relative emerged. 
TOLLIVER’S ORBIT 



She was about five feet four 
and moved as if she walked 
lightly even in stronger gravi- 
ty than Ganymede’s. Her trim 
coiffure was a shade too 
blonde which served to set off 
both the blue of her eyes and 
the cap apparently won from 
one of the pilots. She wore 
gray slacks and a heavy sweat- 
er, like a spacer. 

“Sorry to keep you wait- 
ing,” she said, sliding into 
the seat beside Tolliver. “By 
the way, just call me Betty.” 
“Sure,” agreed Tolliver 
thinking, Ohmigod! Trying 
already to he just one of the 
gang, instead of Lady Betty! 
Is her old man the treasurer, 
Or does he just know where 
bodies are buried? 

“They were making dates,” 
said the girl. “Were they rib- 
bing me, or is it true that none 
of the four of them goes back 
with the ship?” 

“It’s true enough,” Tolliver 
assured her. “We need people 
out here, and it costs a lot to 
make the trip. They found 
they could send back loaded 
ships by ‘automatic’ flight — 
that is, a long, slow, econom- 
ical orbit and automatic sig- 
nalling equipment. Then 
they’re boarded approaching 
Earth’s orbit and landed by 
pilots who don’t have to waste 
their time making the entire 
trip.” 

H e followed the signals of 
a spacesuited member of 
the port staff and maneuvered 
out of the dome. Then he 

51 




headed the tractor acroaa the 
frozen surface of Ganymede 
toward the permanent domes 
of the city. 

‘^How is it here?” asked the 
girl. “They told me it’s pretty 
rough.” 

“What did you expect?” 
asked Tolliver. “Square dances 
with champagne?” 

“Don’t be silly. Daddy says 
I’m supposed to learn traffic 
routing and the business man- 
agement of a local branch. 
They probably won’t let me 
see much else.” 

“You never can tell,” said 
the pilot, yielding to tempta- 
tion. “Any square inch of 
Ganymede is likely to be dan- 
gerous.” 

ril he sorry later, he re- 
flected, but if Jeffers keeps 
me jockeying this creeper, 
Vm entitled to some amuse- 
ment. And Daddy* s little girl 
is trying too hard to sound 
like one of the gang. 

“Yeah,” he went on, “right 
now, I don’t do a thing but 
drive missions from the city 
to the spaceport.” 

“Missions! You call driving 
a mile or so a mission?** 

Tolliver pursed his lips 
and put on a shrewd expres- 
sion. 

“Don’t sneer at Ganymede, 
honey !” he warned porten- 
tously. “Many a ihan who did 
isn’t here today. Take the 
fellow who used to drive this 
mission !” 

“You can call me Betty. 
What happened to him?** 

52 



“I’ll tell you some day” 
Tolliver promised darkly. 
“This moon can strike like a 
vicious animal.” 

“Oh, they told me there was 
nothing alive on Ganymede!” 
“I was thinking of the 
mountain slides,” said the pi- 
lot. “Not to mention volcanic 
puffballs that pop out through 
the frozen crust where you’d 
least expect. That’s why I 
draw such high pay for driv- 
ing an unarmored tractor.” 
“You use armored vehi- 
cles?” gasped the girl. 

She was now sitting bolt 
upright in the swaying seat. 
Tolliver deliberately dipped 
one track into an icy hollow. 
In the light gravity, the trac- 
tor responded with a weird, 
floating lurch. 

“Those slides,” he contin- 
ued. “Ganymede’s only about 
the size of Mercury, some- 
thing like 3200 miles in diam- 
eter, so things get heaped up 
at steep angles. When the 
rock and ice are set to sliding, 
they come at you practically 
horizontally. It doesn’t need 
much start, and it barrels on 
for a long way before there’s 
enough friction to stop it. If 
you’re in the way — ^well, it’s 
just too bad !” 

Say, that*s pretty good! he 
told himself. What a liar you 
are, Tolliver! 

He enlarged upon other 
dangers to 1^ encountered on 
the satellite, taking care to 
impress the newcomer with 
the daredeviltry of John Toll- 
iver, driver of “missions”

across the menacing wastes 
between dome and port. 

In the end, he displayed 
conclusive evidence in the 
form of the weekly paycheck 
he had received that morning. 
It did not, naturally, indicate 
he was drawing the salary of 
a space pilot. Betty looked 
thoughtful. 

‘‘I’m retiring in six months 
if I’m still alive,” he said 
bravely, edging the tractor 
into the airlock at their desti- 
nation. “Made my pile. No use 
pushing your luck too far.” 
His charge seemed noticea- 
bly subdued, but cleared her 
throat to request that Tolliver 
guide her to the office of the 
manager. She trailed along as 
if with a burden of worry 
upon her mind, and the pilot’s 
conscience prickled. 

ril get hold of her after 
Jeffers is through and set 
her straight, he resolved. It 
isn't really funny if the suck- 
er is too ignorant to know 
better. 

R emembering his 

grudge against the manag- 
er, he took pleasure in walk- 
ing in without knocking. 

“Jeffers,” he announced, 
“this is. just call her Betty.” 
The manager’s jowled fea- 
tures twisted into an expres- 
sion of welcome as jovial as 
that of a hungry crocodile. 

“Miss Koslow!” he beamed, 
like a politician the day before 
the voting. “It certainly is an 
honor to have you on Gany- 
mede with us ! That’s all, 
TOLLIVER’S ORBIT 



Tolliver, you can go. Yes, 
indeed ! Mr. Koslow— the pres- 
ident, that is: your father — 
sent a message about you. I 
repeat, it will be an honor to 
show you the ropes. Did you 
want something else, Toll- 
iver?” 

“Never mind him, Mr. Jeff- 
ers,” snapped the girl, in a 
tone new to Tolliver. “We 
won’t be working together, 
I’m afraid. You’ve already had 
enough rope.” 

Jeffers seemed to stagger 
standing still behind his desk. 
His loose lips twitched uncer- 
tainly, and he looked ques- 
tioningly to Tolliver. The pi- 
lot stared at Betty, trying to 
recall pictures he had seen of 
the elder Koslow. He was also 
trying to remember some of 
the lies he had told enroute 
from the spaceport. 

“Wh-wh-what do you mean. 
Miss Koslow?” Jeffers stam- 
mered. 

He darted a suspicious glare 
at Tolliver. 

“Mr. Jeffers,” said the girl, 
“I may look like just another 
spoiled little blonde, but the 
best part of this company will 
be mine someday. I was not 
allowed to reach twenty-two 
without learning something 
about holding on to it.” 

Tolliver blinked. He had 
taken her for three or four 
years older. Jeffers now ig- 
nored him, intent upon the 
girl. 

“Daddy gave me the title of 
tenth vice-president mostly as 
a joke, when he told me to 

53 




find out what was wrong with 
operations on Ganymede. I 
have some authority, though. 
And you look like the source 
of the trouble to me.*' 

“You can’t prove anything,” 
declared Jeffers hoarsely. 

“Oh, can’t I? IVe already 
seen certain evidence, and the 
rest won’t be hard to find. 
Where are your books, Mr. 
Jeffers? You’re as good as 
fired !” 

-The manager dropped heav- 
ily to his chair. He stared un- 
believingly at Betty, and Toll- 
iver thought he muttered 
something about “just land- 
ed.” After a moment, the big 
man cafne out of his daze 
enough to stab an intercom 
button with his finger. He 
growled at someone on the 
other end to come in without 
a countdown. 

Tolliver, hardly thinking 
about it, expected the someone 
to be a secretary, but it turned 
out to be three members of 
Jeffers’ headquarters staff. He 
recognized one as Rawlins, a 
warehouse chief, and guessed 
that the other two might be 
his assistants. They were large 
enough. 

“No stupid questions!” Jeff- 
ers ordered. “Lock these two 
up while I think!” 

Tolliver started for the 
door immediately, but was 
blocked off. 

“Where should we lock—?” 
the fellow paused to ask. 

Tolliver brought up a snap- 
Py uppercut to the man’s 

54 



chin, feeling that it was a 
poor time to engage Jeffers 
in fruitless debate. 

In the gravity of Ganymede, 
the man was knocked off bal- 
ance as much as he was hurt, 
and sprawled on the floor. 

“I told you no questions!” 
bawled Jeffers. 

The fallen hero, upon aris- 
ing, had to content himself 
with grabbing Betty. The oth- 
ers were swarming over Toll- 
iver. Jeffers came around his 
desk to assist. 

T olliver found himself 
dumped on the floor of an 
empty office in the adjoining 
warehouse building. It seemed 
to him that a long time had 
been spent iji carrying him 
there. 

He heard an indignant yelp, 
and realized that the girl had 
been pitched in with him. The 
snapping of a lock was fol- 
lowed by the tramp of depart- 
ing footsteps and then by 
silence. 

After considering the idea 
a few minutes, Tolliver man- 
aged to sit up. 

He had his wind back. But 
when he fingered the swelling 
lump behind his left ear, a 
sensation befuddled him mo- 
mentarily. 

“I’m sorry about that,” mur- 
mured Betty. 

Tolliver grunted. Sorrow 
would not reduce the throb- 
bing, nor was he in a mood 
to undertake an explanation 
of why Jeffers did not like 
him anyway. 



H. B. FYFE 




•*I think perhaps youVe 
going to have a shiner,” re- 
marked the girl. 

‘"Thanks for letting me 
know in time,” said Tolliver. 

,The skin under his right 
eye did feel a trifle tight, but 
he could see well enough. The 
abandoned and empty look of 
the office worried him. 

“What can we use to get 
out of here?” he mused. 

“Why should we try?” 
asked the girl. “What can he 
do?” 

“You’d be surprised. How 
did you catch on to him so 
soon?” 

“Your p a y c h e c k,” said 
Betty. “As soon as I saw that 
ridiculous amount, it was 
obvious that there was gross 
mismanagement here. It had 
to be Jeffers.” 

Tolliver groaned. 

“Then, on the way over 
here, he as good as admitted 
everything. Yoii didn’t hear 
him, I guess. Well, he seemed 
to be caught all unaware, and 
seemed to blame you for it.” 

“Sure!” grumbled the pilot. 
“He thinks I told you he was 
grafting or smuggling, or 
whatever he has going for him 
here. That’s why I want to get 
out of here — before I find 
myself involved in some kind 
of fatal accident !” 

“What do you know about 
the crooked goings-on here?” 
asked Betty after a startled 
pause. 

“Nothing,” retorted Toll- 
iver. “Except that there are 
some. There are rumors, and I 
TOLLIVER’S ORBIT 



had a halfway invitation to 
join in. 1 think he sells things 
to the mining colonies and 
makes a double profit for him- 
self by claiming the stuff lost 
in transit. You didn’t think 
you scared him that bad over 
a little slack managing?” 

The picture of Jeffers hud- 
dled with his partners in the 
headquarters building, plot- 
ting the next move, brought 
Tolliver to his feet. 

There was nothing in the 
unused office but an old table 
and half a dozen plastic crates. 
He saw that the latter con- 
tained a messof discarded rec- 
ords. 

“Better than nothing at all,” 
he muttered. 

He ripped out a double 
handful of the forms, crum- 
pled them into a pile at the 
doorway, and pulled out his 
cigarette lighter. 

“What do you think you’re 
up to?” asked Betty with some 
concern. 

“This plastic is tough,” said 
Tolliver, “but it will bend 
with enough heat. If I can 
kick loose a hinge, maybe we 
can fool them yet!” 

He got a little fire going, 
and fed it judiciously with 
more papers. 

“You know,” he reflected, 
“it might be better for you to 
stay here. He can’t do much 
about you, and you don’t have 
any real proof just by your- 
self.” 

“I’ll come along with you, 
Tolliver,” said the girl, 

55 




•No, I don’t think you’d 
better.” 

’’Why notr 

”WelI ... after all, what 
would he dare do? Arranging 
an accident to the daughter 
of the boss isn’t something 
that he can pull off without 
a lot of investigation. He’d be 
better off just running for 
it.” 

’’Let’s not argue about it,” 
said Betty, a trifle pale but 
looking determined. “I’m com- 
ing with you. Is that stuff 
getting soft yet?” 

Tolliver kicked at the edge 
of the door experimentally. 
It seemed to give slightly, so 
he knocked the burning papers 
aside and drove his heel hard 
at the corner below the hinge. 

The plastic yielded. 

“That’s enough already, 
Tolliver,” whispered the girl. 
“We can crawl through!” 

H ardly sixty seconds lat- 
er, he led her into a maze 
of stacked crates in the ware- 
house proper. The building 
was not much longer than 
wide, for each of the struc- 
tures in the colony had its 
own hemispherical emergency 
dome of transparent plastic. 
They soon reached the other 
end. 

“I think there’s a storeroom 
for spacesuits around here,” 
muttered Tolliver. 

“Why do you want them?” 
“Honey, I just don’t think 
it will be so easy to lay hands 
on a tractor. I l^t Jeffers al- 
ready phoned the garage and 



all the airlocks with acme 
good lie that will keep me 
from getting through.” 

After a brief search, he 
located the spacesuits. Many, 
evidently intended for re- 
placements, had never been 
unpacked, but there were a 
dozen or so serviced and 
standing ready for emergen- 
cies. He showed Betty how to 
climb into one, and checked 
her seals and valves after don- 
ning a suit himself. 

“That switch under your 
chin,” he said, touching hel- 
mets so she could hear him. 
“Leave it turned off. Anybody 
might be listening!” 

He led the way out a rear 
door of the warehouse. With 
the heavy knife that was 
standard suit equipment, he 
deliberately slashed a four- 
foot square section out of 
the dome. He motioned to 
Betty to step through, then 
trailed along with the plastic 
under his arm. 

He caught up and touched 
helmets again. 

“Just act as if you’re on 
business,” he told her. “For 
all anyone can see, we might 
be inspecting the dome.” 
“Where are you going?” 
asked Betty. 

“Right through the wall, 
and then head for the nearest 
mine. Jeffers can’t be running 
everythingT 

“Is there any way to get to 
a TV?” asked the girl. “I ... 
uh . Daddy gave me a good 
number to call if I needed 
help.” 



H. B. FYFE 




^How good?^^ 

•^Pretty official, as a mat- 
ter of fact.” 

”AI1 right,” Tolliver decid- 
ed. “We’ll try the ship you 
just came in on. They might 
have finished refueling and 
left her empty.” 

They had to cross one open 
l«uie between buildings, and 
Tolliver was very conscious 
of moving figures in the dis- 
tance; but no one seemed to 
look their way. 

Reaching the foot of the 
main dome over the establish- 
ment, he glanced furtively 
about, then plunged his knife 
into the transparent material. 

From the corner of his eye, 
he thought he saw Betty make 
a startled gesture, hut he had 
his work cut out for him. This 
was tougher than the interior 
dome. 

Finally, he managed to saw 
a ragged slit through v/hich 
they could squeeze. There 
was room to walk between the 
inner and outer layer, so he 
moved along a few yards. A 
little dust began to blow about 
where they bad gone through. 
He touched telmets once 
more. 

“This time,” he said, “the 
air will really start to blow, 
so get through as fast as you 
can. If I can slap this piece 
of plastic over the rip, it may 
stow down the loss of pres- 
sure enough to give us quite 
a lead before the alarms go 
off.” 

Through the faceplates, he 
saw the girl nod, wide-eyed. 

TOLLIVER S ORBIT 



As soon as he plunged the 
knife into the outer layer, he 
could see dusty, moist air 
puffing out into the near- 
vacuum of Ganymede^s sur- 
face. Fumbling, he cut as fast 
as he could and shoved Betty 
through the small opening. 

Squeezing through in his 
turn, he left one arm inside 
to spread the plastic sheet as 
best he could. The internal 
air pressure slapped it against 
the inside of the dome as if 
gluedy sdthough it immediate- 
ly showed an alarming ten- 
dency to balloon through the 
ruptured spot. 

They^ll find it, all right, 
Tolliver reminded himself. 
Don*t be here when they do! 

He grabbed Betty by the 
wrist of her spacesuit and 
headed for the nearest out- 
cropping of rock. 

It promptly developed that 
she had something to learn 
about running on ice in such 
low gravity. Until they were 
out of direct line of sight 
from the settlement, Tolliver 
simply dragged her. 

Then, when he decided that 
it was safe enough to pause 
and tell her how to manage 
better, the sight of her out- 
raged scowl through the face- 
plate made him think better 
of it. 

By the time we reach the 
ship, she'll have learned, he 
consoled himself. 

TT was a long mile, even at 

the pace human muscles 
could achieve on Ganymede. 

57 





i 








They took one short rest, dur- 
ing which Tolliver was forced 
to explain away the dangers 
of slides and volcanic puff- 
balls. He admitted to having 
exaggerated slightly. In the 
end, they reached the space- 
ship. 

There seemed to be no one 
about. The landing dome had 
been collapsed and stored, and 
the ship’s airlock port was 
closed. 

‘That’s all right,” Tolliver 
told the girl. “We can get in 
with no trouble.” 

It was when he looked 
about to make sure that they 
were unobserved that he 
caught a glimpse of motion 
back toward the city. He 
peered at the spot through the 
dim light. After a moment, he 
definitely recognized the out- 
line of a tractor breasting a 
rise in the ground and tilting 
downward again. 

“In fact, we have to get in 
to stay out of trouble,” he 
said to Betty. 

He located the switch-cover 
in the hull, opened it and ac- 
tivated the mechanism that 
swung open the airlock and 
extended the ladder. 

It took him considerable 
scrambling to boost the girl 
up the ladder and inside, but 
he managed. They passed 
through the airlock, fretting 
at the time required to seal, 
pump air and open the inner 
hatch; and then Tolliver led 
the way up another ladder to 
the control room. It was a 
clumsy trip in their space- 
TOLLIVER’S ORBIT 



suits, but he wanted to save 
time. 

In the control room, he 
shoved the girl into an ac- 
celeration seat, glanced at the 
gauges and showed her how 
to open her helmet. 

“Leave the suit on,” he or- 
dered, getting in the first 
word while she was still shak- 
ing her head. “It will help a 
little on the takeoff.” 

“Takeoff!” shrilled Betty. 
“What do you think you’re 
going to do? I just want to 
use the radio or TV!” 

“That tractor will get here 
in a minute or two. They 
might cut your conversation 
kind of short. Now shut up 
and let me look over these 
dials !” 

He ran a practiced eye over 
the board, reading the condi- 
tion of the ship. It pleased 
him. Everything was ready 
for a takeoff into an economy 
orbit for Earth. He busied 
himself making a few adjust- 
ments, doing his best to ignore 
the protests from his partner 
in crime. He warned her the 
trip might be long. r 

“I told you not to come,’^ 
he said at last. “Now sit 
back !” 

He sat down and pushed a 
button to start the igniting 
process. 

In a moment, he could feel 
the rumble of the rockets 
through the deck, and then it 
was out of his hands for sev- 
eral minutes. 

“That wasn’t so bad,” Bet- 
ty admitted some time later. 

59 




“Did you go in the right di- 
rection?” 

“Who knows?” retorted 
Tolliver. “There wasn’t time 
to check everything. We’ll 
worry about that after we 
make your call.” 

“Oh!” Betty looked help- 
less. It’s in my pocket.” 
Tolliver sighed. In their 
weightless state, it was no 
easy task to pry her out of 
the spacesuit. He thought of 
inquiring if she needed any 
further help, but reminded 
himself that this was the 
boss’s daughter. When Betty 
produced a memo giving fre- 
quency and call sign, he set 
about making contact. 

It took only a few minutes, 
as if the channel had been 
monitored expectantly, and 
the man who flickered into 
life on the screen wore a uni- 
form. 

“Space Patrol?” whispered 
Tolliver incredulously. 

“That’s right,” said Betty. 
“Uh . Daddy made arrange- 
ments for me.” 

Tolliver held her in front 
of the screen so she would 
not float out of range of the 
scanner and microphone. As 
she spoke, he stared exasper- 
atedly at a bulkhead, marvel- 
ing at the influence of a man 
who could arrange for a 
cruiser to escort his daughter 
to Ganymede and wondering 
what was behind it all. 

When he heard Betty re- 
questing assistance in arrest- 
ing Jeffers and reporting the 
manager as the head of a ring 



of crooks, he began to sus- 
pect. He also noticed certain 
peculiarities about the re- 
marks of the Patrolman. 

F ^R one thing, though the 
officer seemed well ac- 
quainted with Betty, he never 
addressed her by the name of 
Koslow. For another, he ac- 
cepted the request as if he 
had been hanging in orbit 
merely until learning who to 
go down after. 

They really sent her out to 
nail someone, Tolliver real- 
ized. Of course, she stumbled 
onto Jeffers by plain dumb 
luck. But she had an idea of 
what to look for. How do I 
get into these things? She 
might have got me killed! 

“We do have one trouble,” 
he heard Betty saying. “This 
tractor driver, Tolliver, saved 
my neck by making the ship 
take off somehow, but he says 
it’s set for a six-month orbit, 
or economy flight. Whatever 
they call it. I don’t think he 
has any idea where we’re 
headed.” 

Tolliver pulled her back, 
holding her in mid-air by the 
slack of her sweater. 

“Actually, I have a fine 
idea,” he informed the officer 
coldly. “I happen to be a 
qualihed space pilot. Every- 
thing here is under control. 
If Miss Koslow thinks you 
should arrest Jeffers, you can 
call us later on this channel.” 
“Miss Koslow?” repeated 
the spacer. “Did she tell you 
— ^wcll, no matter! If you’ll 



60 



H. B. FYFE 




be okay> we^ll attend to the 
other affair immediately." 

He signed off promptly. 
The pilot faced Betty, who 
looked more offended than 
reassured at discovering his 
status. 

“This ‘Miss Koslow* busi- 
ness," he said suspiciously. 
“He sounded funny about 
that." 

The girl grinned. 

“Relax, Tolliver," she told 
him. “Did you really believe 
Daddy would send his own 
little girl way out here to 
Gan)miede to look for who- 
ever was gypping him?" 

“You ... you . ?" 

“Sure. The name’s Betty 
Hanlon. I work for a private 
investigating firm. If old Kos- 
low had a son to imperson- 
ate—" 

“I’d be stuck for six months 
in this orbit with some brash 
young man," Tolliver finished 
for her. “I guess it’s better 
this way," he said meditative- 
ly a moment later. 

“Oh, come on! Can’t they 
get us back? How can you 
tell where we’re going?" 

“I know enough to check 
takeoff time. It was practi- 
cally due anyhow, so we’ll 
float into the vicinity of 
Earth at about the right time 
to be picked up." 

He went on to explain 
something of the tremendous 
cost in fuel necessary to make 
more than minor corrections 
to their course. Even though 
the Patrol ship could easily 
catch the slow freighter, 



bringing along enough fuel to 
head back would be something 
else again. 

“We’ll just have to ride it 
out," he said sympathetically. 
“The ship is provisioned ac- 
cording to law, and you were 
probably going back anyhow." 

“I didn’t expect to so soon." 

“Yeah, you were pretty 
lucky. They’ll think you’re a 
marvel to crack the case in 
about three hours on Gany- 
mede." 

“Great!" muttered Betty. 
“What a lucky girl I am!" 

“Yes," admitted Tolliver, 
“there are problems. If you 
like, we might get the captain 
of that Patrol ship to legalize 
the situation by TV." 

“I can see you’re used to 
sweeping girls off their feet," 
she commented sourly. 

“The main problem is 
whether you can cook." 

Betty frowned at him. 

“I’m pretty good with a 
pistol," she offered, “or going 
over crooked books. But cook? 

- Sorry." 

“Well, one of us had better 
learn, and I’ll have other 
things to do." 

“I’ll think about it," prom- 
ised the girl, staring thought- 
fully at the deck. 

Tolliver anchored himself 
in a seat and grinned as he 
thought about it too. 

After a while, he promised 
himself, 1*11 explain how I cut 
the fuel flow and see if she*s 
detective enough to suspect 
that we're just orbiting Gany^ 
mede! END

THE

OF 

THE 



H enry stopped and squat- 
ted in the underbrush, 
well hidden from the path 
but close enough to see the 
coming group. Within a min- 
ute they became visible. 
There were twenty-five to 
thirty boys, girls and youths 
walking slowly in ragged 
groups, talking and laugh- 
ing. The youngest were 
ahead, a group just entering 
their teens, dressed like the 
rest in jackets and shorts, 
with sandals of plast on their 
feet. The dark, synthetic 
cloth made them a uniformed 
body. 

Henry's nose wrinkled in 
distaste. Again his hideaway 
would be invaded and he 
would have to move on. But 
where to? 

62 



They were opposite him 
now, a bare twenty feet away. 
Most of them looked as alike 
as brothers and sisters, logi- 
cally enough; there was not 
one who wasn't a cousin in 
some degree to the others. 
Plump, round-faced and dull- 
eyed, they lived from cradle 
to grave according to cus- 
tom. It was the custom, when 
they were old enough to feel 
the urge, to join a group like 
this. Together they tramped 
the valley from spring to 
fall, gathering fruit and nuts 
as they came in season. When 
a couple felt like settling 
down they awaited a vacant 
Mastership — a plot of or- 
chard and the house that 
went with it — and moved in. 
They took over the responsi-

witchcraft — but Henry's real offense 
against his strange world was that it 
was dying — and he wanted it to live!

bilities of the place and bred 
or adapted the three children 
necessary to hold it. They 
remained there until they be- 
came Elders. Then they 
moved into Town, where 
they worked in the factories, 
idled and gossiped until 
death overtook them. 

They were ignorant, super- 
stitious, living out their dull 
routine as generations before 
them had. Only a few ques- 
tioned it. Almost none made 
any active challenge. 

The youngsters sighted the 
tavern and made for it at a 
dead run, wanting to claim 
favorable bunks before the 
others arrived. 

Henry was impatient. Ants 
were crawling over his foot, 
but it would never do for him 

THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



to be seen, especially in the 
woods. One didn't go into 
them. They were inhabited 
by goblins, ghosts and fear- 
some animals. 

Finally they were past. He 
straightened, started to step 
into the path, then squatted 
again quickly. Coming alone, 
behind the others, was the 
girl. 

Her slimness and pale hair 
made her stand out from the 
rest. His thoughts had been 
upon her since that day when 
his group passed the house of 
her father, an avocado Mas- 
ter, down in the lower valley. 
She had called to them to 
wait, had run inside to come 
back with her two pouches, 
one for her personal belong- 
ings, the other for food. Liv- 

63 




ing on a fruit diet as they 
did, they ate most of their 
Awakened hours. 

'‘I’m Theta!” she called out 
happily as she joined them. 
“Mama says I’m old enough 
to go with you.” She recog- 
nized a cousin and ran over 
to join her, her hair a spot of 
brightness among the dark. 
He wanted her from that mo- 
ment, but she was far too 
young. He would have to 
wait. 

C OMING towards Theta 
from the opposite direc- 
tion was the slap of flat feet. 

In a moment Henry recog- 
nized Ole. He was consider- 
ably older than the others ; 
his only object in life was 
enjoying all the young girls 
who joined the group. He was 
a bulky dullard and a bully, 
his eyes small and mean. 

It was evident that he was 
looking for the girl. A 
pleased expression spread 
over his face when he saw 
her. She stopped abruptly, 
looking about for a way to 
flee, but the path was en- 
closed by woods and Ole was 
on her. 

“Leave me alone !” she 
cried in anger as his hand 
closed about her wrist. Hen- 
ry could see disgust for him 
in her eyes. Why didn’t she 
let him have what he wanted 
and be done with him? That 
was the way most of the girls 
responded. 

“Won’t have anything to 
do with me, eh?” gloated Ole. 

64 



“Think you are too good for 
us ! I been watching you, 
asking about you. None of 
the boys have had you . 
but you won’t get by me !” 

Henry felt a surge of S5mi- 
pathy for her, fed by his dis- 
like for the other. He slipped 
into the path. He was almost 
up to them before he was 
seen. Ole swung about, still 
holding the girl. Henry 
stopped six feet off. 

“Why don’t you let her 
alone if she doesn’t want 
you?” he asked with deceiv- 
ing mildness, apparently re- 
laxed. 

There was startled fright 
in Ole’s eyes. Henry had ap- 
peared so suddenly, from no- 
where. Worse, he was pro- 
scribed. He was accused of 
learning witchery. 

Henry was taller than Ole, 
bi^t thin and almost weak 
looking. This would be some- 
thing to boast about : cap- 
turing the witch singlehand- 
ed, bringing him in for pun- 
ishment ! 

“Make me let her alone, 
then!” he challenged. 

It was usual to boast and 
strut before fighting. Henry 
took the advantage of imme- 
diate attack. He sprang at 
the other, catching him be- 
fore he unhanded the girl, 
with a right to the jaw, a left 
to the belly. 

Theta ran about fifty feet 
down the path, then turned 
to watch. Ole, head down, 
was closing in to grip his op- 
ponent, but Henry stepped to 



CHARLES MINOR BLACKFORD 




one side, coming up with a 
blow to Ole's right eye. Ole 
raised his guard and Henry 
sank both fists into the oth- 
er's stomach. 

Ole doubled up. 

There was no fight in him. 
He plunged past Henry, 
down the path towards the 
tavern. Henry faced the girl. 
She CMC towards him with- 
out hesitation. 

"Thank you," she said. "I 
shouldn't have left the oth- 
ers. I didn’t think he had no- 
ticed.” 

She walked slowly towards 
the tavern, Henry beside her. 
The past year had made her 
taller, filled her put. Yet the 
sweetness of her expression 
was the same, and the vitality 
in her face and eyes. 

"He’s been after you 
then?” 

She nodded. "Him and a 
couple of others.” 

It was just a turn in the 
path to sight of the tavern. 
Henry halted. 

"You seem to forget I’m 
proscribed,” he reminded her. 

"I don’t care! I like you — 
always have.” Her voice be- 
came tragic, "Why did you 
go into that awful learning 
house?” 

"I got tired of wondering 
— ^wondering what kept the 
food in the bins fresh, how it 
got from the hoppers in the 
fields to the bins. What made 
the light and heat. Where the 
water came from.” 

"But the Old Ones did it 
all by magic!” 

TH€ VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



"What kind of magic?" 
His face had a slightly mock- 
ing expression. "If that was 
so why are things beginning 
to break down? Magic should 
go on forever.” 

F rom the direction of the 
tavern came sounds of 
shouting. He smiled at her. 
"You’d better go on before 
they think I’ve turned you 
into a bat.” 

"Henry — ” she began, but 
she had lingered too long. 
The whole group rounded 
the turn, trotting, their faces 
twisted in superstitious fury. 
They raised their arms when 
they sighted the two. Each 
hand had a stone in it. 

"She’s one of them too !” 
screamed fat, malicious Hec- 
la, seeing a chance to vent 
her envy. "They’re planning 
something! Throw! Throw!” 
Her voice was a hysterical 
shriek. Henry saw the stones 
in the air. Grasping the girl’s 
wrist he drew her into the 
brush beside the path. 

He stopped his flight un- 
der an ancient tree and let go 
her wrist. 

"See,” he said, "even to 
speak to me is dangerous.” 
She tossed her head and 
brushed the hair from her 
brow, her eyes scornful. "I 
don't care. I’m sick of them.” 
"You can go back. Give 
them some fancy tale about 
my hexing you, but say that 
you crossed two sticks or 
something and got away,” 

She looked him squarely in 

65 




the face, her own composed 
and determined. ‘"I’d rather 
stay with you.” 

He dropped to a jutting 
rock and scraped at the dead 
leaves with the heel of his 
sandal. 

“It’s not nice,” he began, 
“the life I live. Hiding in the 
woods by day, sneaking into 
deserted houses or taverns at 
night for food and warmth. 
I’ve been doing it all summer 
now, and that’s bad enough. 
In a month the Masters of 
these upper levels will be 
closing their houses and the 
taverns, moving to town for 
the winter. Everything on 
the lower levels will be taken 
up. They expect me to be 
starved into surrender.” 
Theta dropped to her knees 
beside him. 

“I’d rather be with you. 
I’ve wanted to be with you 
ever since I first saw you. 
But you never seemed to no- 
tice me.” 

“I noticed you.” He placed 
a hand over hers. “But you 
were so young looking, so 
sweet. I was waiting for you 
to grow up a little more. 
Then, when I found an open 
Mastership, I was going to 
ask you to share it with me.” 
Theta felt a tingling hap- 
piness. Her face flushed, her 
eyes brightened. 

“Henry!” she cried. “I’ve 
always wanted you! That’s 
why I never...” 

He put an arm about her 
and pulled her close. They 
sat that way for minutes. 

66 



“I’ll give you a Master- 
ship!” he cried out. ‘T’ll give 
you the whole valley !” He 
pushed her shoulders around 
until she was facing him. 
“What is your first wish. 
Mistress of the Valley?” 

“Something to eat,” she 
said promptly. 

Henry made a rueful face. 
“My dear, that is something 
you will have to become used 
to: being hungry. But fortu- 
nately I know of a ruined 
and deserted house where the 
bins are still operating.” 

The forest they were in 
filled a s t e e p-sided ravine. 
He followed it for some dis- 
tance, then started abruptly 
up the left-hand slope to a 
low-crowned crest planted 
with apple trees. A hundred 
yards away was the house. 

One corner of it was 
crushed by a fallen tree. The 
low sun made shafts of light 
through the trees as Henry 
approached it cautiously. 
Theta behind him. He en- 
tered through the broken 
wall into what was once a 
bedroom, then through a door 
into the remainder of the 
house. 

It was a typical living 
room they entered, with the 
regular ration of furnishings. 
The visiphone and visiscreen 
were set into the inner wall; 
a calendar clock was over the 
front door, its dial marked 
with symbols for planting, 
pruning, cutting and pick- 
ing. The hand was approach- 
ing the latter symbol, Henry 

CHARLES MINOR BLACKFORD 




went through into the kitch- 
en, leaving her to watch 
through the window. He re- 
turned with a basket of 
mixed fruit. 

She reached for an avocado, 
plucking her knife from its 
sheath with the other hand. 

‘'Hey! Wait a minute!*’ 
Henry cried. “You are a sin- 
ner now, remember?” He 
pushed the basket towards 
her. “Fill your pouch first, 
eat later.” 

They ate, keeping an eye 
on the path towards the 
house until dark. No one 
moved at night except on ex- 
treme emergency, and then 
only with lanterns and noise. 
Withput lights on other than 
the normal glow of the walls 
they retired^to one of the un- 
damaged bedrooms. 

“See?** she said, with a rip- 
pling, ' contented laugh. “I 
waited for you.” 

II 

I T was still dark when they 
filled their pouches to ca- 
pacity and slipped from the 
house. 

“What will we do now?” 
Theta asked. 

Henry looked down. “I 
don’t know. I had something 
planned, but. 

“What was it?” 

“I was going to climb up 
the mountain, past the top 
defrost towers and the force 
fence, to the top of the 
ridge.” 

She stared at him, her eyes 
THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



round. “Why, that’s the edge 
of the world! You might fall 
off!” 

“Not if I’m careful.” 

Only a few in the valley 
could boast of going beyond 
the top row of defrosters, 
fewer yet of even going 
within looking distance of 
the force fence. Beyond it, 
tradition said, lived great 
beasts that could eat a man 
with one bite. While the 
ridges that bounded the val- 
ley on three sides, to the 
east, west and north, were the 
edges of the world, from 
which one dropped off into 
bottomless space. 

To the south, where forest 
enclosed the mouth of the 
valley, tradition was vague, 
but the edge must be off 
there somewhere. 

It had taken Henry all 
summer to build up his deter- 
mination. But now, up was 
the only direction it was safe 
to go. 

“If you’re not afraid, I’m 
not e i t h e r,” Theta said. 
“Let’s go.” 

Carrying the basket with 
its remaining supply of fruit 
between them, they started 
up the slope. It was only a 
short distance to the top de- 
frosters. These only went 
into action at blossom time 
for the apples and other high- 
land fruits. 

From there to the force 
fence was a steep climb 
through rocks and brush. 
Their pace grew slower as 
they approached the fence. 

67 




Their eyes scanned the rocks 
and scant brush for signs of 
the great beasts, but they saw 
none. Higher yet, about a 
quarter of a mile, was the top 
of the ridge. The edge of the 
earth. 

Theta pressed against him. 
‘T’m scared,” she murmured. 

Henry’s face became set. 
**We said we were going,” he 
said curtly. “You can stay if 
you wish.” He selected rocks 
for both hands. 

The force fence only gave 
them a strong tingling sensa- 
tion. The plast sandals insu- 
lated them somewhat. The 
slope became steeper, but 
there was no indication of 
any great beasts. Too excited 
to stop and rest, although 
they were breathing heavily, 
they pressed onward. 

Would it be night down 
there, over the edge of the 
world? Stars shining? Would 
it be daylight and clouds? 

The top of the ridge was a 
hundred feet away . ten. 
Henry flung himself on the 
ground so if he became dizzy 
he would not lose his balance 
and fall. Theta did the same. 
Side by side, they crept the 
remaining distance. 

What they saw made them 
stare in open-mouthed amaze- 
ment. 

B efore them was another 
ridge running out from 
the northern range. It was 
pretty much like the one they 
were on. 

Between it and them was 



another valley. Defrost tow- 
ers rose from among the 
trees. Over the top of the op- 
posite ridge, they could see 
still another. The northern 
mountains were lost in die 
blue distance. 

The shock to both was un- 
nerving. Steeled to look out 
into Limbo, they found a 
valley much like their own. 

Together they turned and 
looked back into what could 
be seen of their own valley. 

Even in shape the two 
were loughly similar. They 
could see the tall, slim de- 
frost towers, an occasional 
house and the geometrical de- 
signs of the groves and or- 
chards with their orderly 
rows of trees. There was 
Town at the lower end of the 
valley. And there, at the up- 
per end, was something they 
never knew existed; a 
large, ivy-clad building that 
stretched f rom cliffside to 
cliffside. And yet above that 
was a still, blue lake. 

Henry looked ahead again. 

There was a difference in 
the other valley. There were 
no orderly rows of fruit 
trees, only thick forest like 
that which grew only in their 
ravines or beyond the foot of 
the valley. The defrost tow- 
ers looked down on multicol- 
ored autumn foliage, even in 
the bottom of the valley 
where everything should be 
green. 

Why weren’t there fruit 
trees for the defrosters to 
protect? What kind of a crop 



68 



CHARLES MINOR BLACKFORD 




did this valley grow? Henry 
scrambled to nis feet* 

Theta looked up at him. 
•^What. r 

‘T'm going down there.** 

•*What for?” 

**To see what they grow. 
What kind of people they 
are.” 

“They might...” 

He smiled down at her. 
“I've become an expert at not 
being seen,” he assured her. 
“I've had them pass five feet 
away.” 

Theta got up. “I'm coming, 
too.” 

They reached the force 
fence, but there was no irri- 
tation. The forest started 
immediately and it was fair- 
ly clear of underbrush. There 
were no paths to be seen, no 
sounds of harvesters, no un- 
familiar trees. Even on the 
floor of the valley there were 
no signs of life, although 
they had seen and avoided 
several houses. 

Henry stopped suddenly, 
staring ahead. 

“What's the matter?” 
Theta asked. 

Wordlessly Henry pointed 
to the bole of a dead and rot- 
ting tree. Its straight trunk 
had branches coming out of 
it in orderly rings, its top cut 
off to make the branches 
spread at ladder distance 
above the ground. 

It leaned drunkenly against 
a supporting tree. 

“Avocado,” he said. “This 
was once a grove.” 

The normal fear of the un- 



familiar swept over Theta. “I 
want to get out of here. It 
scares me,” she quavered. 

Henry glanced up at the 
sun. “Too late to cross over 
now,” he said. “We’ll find a 
house.” 

He turned and looked 
about. There should be one 
close, on the slope of the 
ridge so as not to take up 
useable land. He sighted one 
and made for it. From the 
outside it looked no differ- 
ent from those in their own 
valley. 

Beside it was an old apple 
tree with some emaciated 
fruit on it. At least they 
wouldn't starve. As the house 
was obviously empty he went 
around to the back, got a 
picking ladder off the rack 
and plucked enough fruit to 
fill their pouches, although 
it was unflavorable. Not un- 
til then did they venture • to 
the front door and push it 
open. 

A S far as they could see it 
was like the houses in 
their valley, only it was cold, 
with a chill dampness. Light 
gray dust covered every- 
th i n g ; cobwebs festooned 
the walls. That it had not 
been lived in for years, per- 
haps generations, was evi- 
dent. Theta clung to his arm, 
shivering and afraid. Henry 
shook her off. He strode to 
the kitchen and pulled open 
a bin. In the bottom was dust, 
smelling faintly of peaches. 
“We'll clean out a bed- 



THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



69 




room for the night/' he said, 
re-entering the living room. 

In the bedroom the wester- 
ly sun poured light through 
a dust-covered window, put- 
ting the bed somewhat in 
shadow. It, too, was covered 
with dust, turning the ever- 
lasting blankets into a color 
uniform with the room. Their 
movements stirred up dust 
that danced as motes in the 
streaming sunlight as if to 
bar their way across the 
room. They walked into it. 
Their eyes could now see 
clearly what was beyond. 

Theta screamed and sprang 
back. 

Protruding beyond the up- 
per edges of the blankets 
were two skulls! 

They were outside, breath- 
ing heavily, before they re- 
alized they had moved. Henry 
stared at the still open door, 
at -the black hole through the 
white wall. It was the first 
time they had seen the after- 
math of death. For their peo- 
ple, there were places into 
which bodies were placed. 
From them they vanished 
like all other refuse. 

Shaken by the horror of it, 
they plunged into the forest 
in panic. 

The sun dropped behind 
the ridge; the air chilled. 
Bones or no bones they had 
to find shelter for the night. 
Fire, naked flame, they never 
had seen or knew existed. 
Heat came from the walls of 
houses, with warm clothing 
and blankets. 

70 



Henry’s lips firmed. Dead 
ones or no dead ones, they 
h^“ to find "something to 
keep’ them warm during the 
night. 

Another house appeared. 
With fast beating hearts 
they entered. It was now 
warmer inside, but still 
chilly. They would still need 
coverings. 

“Stay here,” Henry said. 

Me strode into the nearest 
bedroom. Without stopping 
to look around, he stepped to 
the bed. Closing his eyes, he 
snatched off the bedding and 
fled into the livingroom. 

Together, crouched in a 
corner, the bedding around 
them, they spent the night. 

Sleep did not come imme- 
diately. Henry stared into the 
darkness, reviewing the day, 
putting together what he had 
discovered. 

“It all fits,” he said aloud. 

“What does?” Theta asked. 

“The forest, the dead trees, 
dead people. Something hap- 
pened to everything, perhaps 
all at once. To the defrosters, 
the heaters, the bins. It must 
have been in winter. They 
crept into bed to keep warm, 
then starved to death. All of 
them.” 

“No, no!” Theta cried. 

“But it did. And it’s begin- 
ning to happen to us. Each 
year something stops work- 
ing. The time may come when 
nothing works.” 

“We can’t do anything...” 

“Yes, we can.” 

“What?” 

CHARLES MINOR BLACKFORD 




‘‘Find out why^and try to 
stop it I"' 

III 

A t dawn, stiff and shiver- 
ing, they stumbled out- 
side and by unspoken con- 
sent started directly up the 
slope. 

By full daylight they 
found themselves in a chest- 
nut grove. They stopped to 
fill their pouches. The last 
mile was made in the hot 
warmth of the sun. At the top 
of the ridge they stopped to 
rest. 

As they did, they feasted 
their eyes on the orderly 
groves below them. But Hen- 
ry’s eyes were seeking out 
the squares of brown among 
the green of the lower valley. 
He counted twenty. Far more 
than he realized. The defrost- 
ers had gone dead at inter- 
vals, years apart. 

His eyes crept up the val- 
ley to the structure at its 
head, with the captive lake 
behind it. It must be the 
House of the Old Ones the 
old stories told about but no 
one had ever seen. From it 
they had worked the magic 
that made the valley what it 
was. There, they said, they 
could be seen and heard to 
speak. 

• If he could get to see the 
Old Ones, ask them ques- 
tions, perhaps they would tell 
him what should be done. 

"Where are we going 
now?” Theta asked. 

THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



"To the House of the Old 
Ones. Up there,” he said, 
pointing. "Perhaps they can 
tell us something.” 

She clutched his arm. "You 
can’t!” she cried. "They’ll... 
they’ll...” 

"They’ll what?” 

"I don’t know! Something 
awful!” 

"That’s what they said 
about the learning house, but 
there was nothing in it but 
dust. I found, from the size 
of the chairs, that you had to 
start learning almost from 
the time you walked. I didn’t 
even know how to start!” 
"Then you didn’t learn 
anything?” 

"Nothing.” 

He came to his feet. "You 
don’t have to go if you don’t 
want to.” 

"I go where you go,” she 
said with stubborn determi- 
nation. 

They had to dip down be- 
low the force fence to find 
water, then keep to the har- 
vested portions where the 
Masters had gone to Town 
for the winter. They were 
lucky in finding houses 
where the keys had been lost, 
and thus had been left un- 
locked. 

It was noon the next day 
when they forced themselves 
through the brush to find 
themselves within feet of 
their destination. With Hen- 
ry leading they skirted it, 
looking for an entrance. Close 
to the center they found a 
deep indentation with a pair 

71 




of doors at its inner end. 
Cautiously, over the accumu- 
lated leaves and rubble, they 
moved toward them, wonder- 
ing how to get inside. 

The moment Henry came 
within three feet of them 
they flew open, inwards. 

Theta screamed and sprang 
back. Henry stopped, star- 
tled. 

**It*s nothing to be scared 
of,” he reassured her. ^‘They 
say that the doors of Hall in 
Town used to open this way 
until someone broke a glass 
button on the wall. Come on.” 

There was another pair of 
glass doors that opened the 
same way as they approached. 
They led to a large reception 
room with a desk and chair 
opposite the door, chairs in a 
row along the wall. The floor 
was red tile, with a white 
line, about six inches wide, 
circling around to a door to 
the left. 

Behind the deck was an- 
other door. 

4^ SIGHTSEERS,” said a 

^ voice from out of no- 
where that made Theta 
scream, '‘will follow the 
white line through the door 
to the left. Those with busi- 
ness in the offices will con- 
sult the receptionist. Please 
proceed.” 

Almost in a state of trance, 
Henry led the way along the 
white line. The door opened 
and admitted them, then a 
second door. 

Here everything was spot- 



less, dustless, though no one 
had been there for years. 

“You are now in the gen- 
erating room,” the voice be- 
gan again. “The humidity is 
zero. All dirt and dust has 
been removed. What you 
bring in with you will be 
gone in five minutes.” 

They were on a balcony, 
looking down into a large 
space. On the floor below 
them seemed to be a huge 
cylinder, suspended between 
two metal-covered blocks. 
Only by the glimmering re- 
flections from its polished 
surface could one tell that it 
was revolving. 

“Before you is the main 
generator,” the voice began 
again. “If you look closely 
you will note that the arma- 
ture shaft does not touch its 
supporting bearings. It is 
held in suspension by polar- 
ized barumal obtained from 
Mars, so there is no friction 
and no wear. It is powered by 
water reduced to hydrogen 
and oxygen. The excess gases 
are used in the hoppers and 
storage bins to force out the 
air and preserve the foods on 
their way to their destina- 
tions. Some gas is piped to 
the disposal plants, in which 
all organic matter is con- 
verted into fertilizer.” 

Henry felt let down, cheat- 
ed. It was just an empty 
building containing soundless 
machinery and a recorded 
lecture. No Old Ones. Noth- 
ing he wanted. 

“Now behind you,” the 



72 



CHARLES MINOR BLACKFORD 





the valley of the masters 



voice began again, “you can 
see into the Control Room. 
From there every machine, 
store or house can have its 
power cut on or off. And if 
anything goes wrong with its 
circuit a button on the board 
flashes red until it is re- 
paired. The glowing red but- 
ton close to the window is 
the master switch that will 
shut off everything in case 
of an emergency, such as an 
earthquake.” 

Theta pressed her nose to 
the glass window. “Just 
think,” she breathed, “push 
that and everything stops!” 

Perhaps that’s what hap- 
pened in the other valley, 
thought Henry. Someone 
pushed the red button. .then 
couldn’t get things going 
again. 

“Now follow the line to 
the next room and be seated. 
There you will be shown how 
the complex of the valley was 
constructed cuid how it oper- 
ates.” 

On entering the hall they 
found several rows of seats 
facing a large screen. Soft 
music began as they entered. 
The hall darkened and the 
screen lit up, showing the 
valley as it was before the 
work began. Forest mainly, a 
few farms scattered along 
the narrow bottoms. 

What startled Henry was 
that they were above the val- 
ley, looking down as they 
seemed to drift through the 
air. So the old tales were 
right! The Old Ones could 

74 



fly through the air! Here was 
proof of it. 

He sat on the edge of his 
seat, breathing hard, waiting 
to see the Old Ones, giant of 
stature, who could tear a tree 
out of the ground or shovel 
away a mountain. 

But the first humans he 
saw were men like himself 
and those in the valley. Men 
who pointed at places while 
others squinted in that direc- 
tion through strange instru- 
ments. He wished he could 
follow the talk, but the men 
pronounced words different- 
ly and used many he had nev- 
er heard. He had to use his 
eyes instead of his ears. 

T hey started to work 
right where he was — he 
recognized the outlines of 
the ridges about them — but it 
was done by no giant extend- 
ing his hand and showering 
magic. Big machines dug 
away the ground. Other 
things with no visible means 
of locomotion brought build- 
ing materials up a broad road 
where there was not even a 
path now. A little man, gray- 
ing and wrinkled, answered 
questions of their invisible 
guide, and, as he did, he gave 
directions to others. Was he 
one of the Old Ones, not as 
large as himself, no older 
than his father? 

Behind him on the screen 
the building Henry was in 
was going up. And men were 
making it, ordinary men, not 
magic. 

CHARLES MINOR 3LACKFORD 




Were the Old Ones just 
ordinary men, their magic 
not strange words and mo- 
tions but machines they ma- 
nipulated with their hands 
and feet? They were not 
gods, just men who had be- 
gun to learn sitting in the 
little chairs in the learning 
house. 

He watched them dig the 
trenches from the groves-to- 
be to the hidden storage bins, 
put in the pipes lined with 
gravity-repellent barumal, 
lay the snakelike cables that 
he had seen occasionally 
where erosion had exposed 
them. He saw the building of 
Town, the Master’s houses 
and the final planting of the 
groves. The record ended. 

Henry remained staring at 
the blank screen until Theta 
nudged him and brought him 
back to the present. 

The white line led on, past 
large offices on one side, on 
the other windows looking 
down into a vast storeroom 
that contained parts for re- 
pairing everything in the 
valley. The Old Ones knew 
that, some day, things would 
start breaking down and had 
prepared for it. They had not 
prepared for life dropping 
into routine, interest in prog- 
ress being lost. 

What need was there to 
spend years in school when 
everything was already done 
for you? 

The picture had shown 
some buildings close to the 
cliffs on one side that looked 

THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



like the apartment houses in 
Town. They broke through 
the brush and found one. 

Other than for dust it was 
in good condition. The food 
bins were filled, but the con- 
tents had dried to the hard- 
ness of stone. As soon as 
they were emptied they be- 
gan to refill; but it was two 
days of constant emptying 
before eatable fruit began to 
appear. 

By the end of a week they 
had the rooms they needed 
cleaned and some of the 
brush about the place cut 
clear. 

It left Henry free to roam 
the plant. He sat again and 
again through the record of 
construction, understanding 
a little more each time. He 
noted, for instance, where 
what was now forest at the 
entrance to the valley was 
once farmland, laid out in 
squarish, varicolored fields. 
He found his way into the 
control room, discovered how 
to trace the lines from the 
board to their end on the 
large map on the wall across 
from the board. 

One day, while it was 
snowing heavily above the 
permanent defrosters, he 
heard a buzzer sound and saw 
a light turn from green to 
red. He traced it down. It 
was the damaged house where 
they had first taken refuge. 

There was plenty of time 
to ponder. Each time it end- 
ed in the same question and 
the same conclusion. Some- 



75 




thing had to be begun before 
it was too late. The valley 
had to be stirred out of its 
antipathy. 

But how? 

One morning, before dawn, 
he sat up in bed. Theta asked 
what was wrong. 

‘T’m going to the meeting 
in Town at Peach Blossom 
Time,’' he announced. “Some- 
thing has to be done.*' 

Theta clutched his arm. 
“You can’t! They’ll kill 
you !” 

‘T have to ! Do you want 
our children, or our chil- 
dren’s children, to die like 
those people on the other 
side of the ridge?” 

“No, but. 

“I have to go — have to 
make them listen.” 

IV 

T he Peach Blossom Time 
Meeting was always the 
best in the year. Those not al- 
ready in Town were on the 
nearby bottom groves. After 
it, the Masters would return 
to the upper orchards, and 
the youth work parties would 
start their rounds. During 
the three-day meeting there 
would be dances and parties, 
an exchange of news while 
the assembled Elders would 
judge disputes, pass on the 
qualifications of Masters, de- 
posing the lazy and unfit, se- 
lecting couples to take their 
places. It was the one time of 
the year when Henry could 
get the ear of everyone.

They traveled down un- 
seen, slipping into unlocked 
houses for food and the 
night. They entered Town at 
the beginning of the first 
meeting. They made it un- 
recognized to the Hall. 

It was not crowded. The 
day was bland ; most pre- 
ferred to stay outside and 
watch the proceedings on the 
visiscreen. Henry and Theta 
slipped into a section to one 
side and awaited the clear- 
ance of the immediate busi- 
ness of the Elders. 

There was none of impor- 
tance. Within ah hour all 
that was pending was cleared 
up. The Senior Elder, emaci- 
ated and with shaking hands, 
faced the audience. 

“Any further business?” 
he quavered. 

Henry stood up. “Yes,” he 
called out. “Something very 
important.” 

Theta fully intended to 
follow him, but she found 
she could not move. It was as 
if she was tied to the chair. 
The more practical of the 
two, she knew that the men 
he was facing would refuse 
to face the facts. All he was 
doing was placing himself in 
their hands. And that meant 
death ! 

The elders peered in his 
direction as he gained the 
aisle. Ole twisted about in his 
seat and was the first one to 
recognize him. For a moment 
he stared open-mouthed. 

“It’s Henry Callis!” he 
cried out. “He’s proscribed 



CHAf^LES MINOR BLACKFORD 




for learning witchery! Crab 
him!” 

Henry stopped before him. 
Ole's words l^came a gurgle 
and dried up. 

"‘If I'm a witch,'' Henry 
said loudly, “I'm a good per- 
son to keep away from. 
Whether I am or not, I have 
something important to tell 
you. And all of you had bet- 
ter listen !'' 

He started again for the 
platform, those along the 
aisle shrinking back as he 
passed. The Elders, from fat 
to withered, with the same 
uneasy expressions on their 
faces, watched silently as he 
climbed to the stage and 
faced them. He could feel 
their chill hostility. He knew 
now that he had done wrong 
but it was too late to undo it. 
He stopped a short distance 
from their table, half turned 
so the audience could hear 
him. 

ax have been living in the 

Ahouses of the Old Ones 
at the head of the valley, be- 
yond the defrosters and the 
forest above them. And I also 
have been up to the top of 
the East Range, expecting to 
look over the edge of the 
world. But what I saw was 
another valley just like this 
one. It had a force fence, de- 
frosters, hoppers, houses. 
Everything this valley has, 
except for one thing: living 
inhabitants. There were peo- 
ple in the houses. Dead peo- 
ple. Reduced to bones, the 

THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



bones of people who had died 
from hunger and cold when 
everything in their valley 
suddenly ceased to work. 

“That is what sent me to 
the House of the Old Ones, 
to see if I could find out 
what had happened. I found 
out there that the Old Ones 
were not giants who did 
things with nuigic, but people 
like ourselves who used ma- 
chinery to make things. Just 
as we make clothing with ma- 
chinery here in Town. They 
had machines that could fly 
through the air. They could 
go the length of the valley in 
an hour in a road machine. 
With machines they built 
these buildings, dug the 
trenches for the hoppers, did 
everything. They were just 
men. Men who had studied in 
the learning houses from the 
time they were tiny children. 
And I found out more...” 

He stopped to take a quick 
look about the still hall. He 
felt the hostility. 

“And I found out more,'^ 
he repeated. “I found that, in 
this valley, twenty banks of 
defro sters have already 
failed. Eleven houses cannot 
be used, plus two taverns and 
one factory here in town. It 
shows that our own system 
is breaking down. Some 
day — ^perhaps tomorrow, per- 
haps not until the time 
of our grandchildren— every- 
thing will stop as it did in 
the next valley. If we want 
to keep living, we must start 
to learn how to keep these 



77 




machines running. At the 
House o£ the Old Ones there 
is a vast store of parts and 
visigraph records showing 
how it should be done. I ask 
you all to come up and see 
the record they have there of 
building the things in the 
valley! See the machine that 
keeps everything running. 
Then let me have a band of 
youths to start studying the 
records until we find out how 
to keep things running.” 
There was silence after he 
finished. The Elders eyed 
him, uneasy, suspicious. 

From the seats of the hall 
came Ole’s voice. 

“Don’t believe him I” he 
shouted. “He wants to get us 
up there so he can bewitch 
us-^Iike he did Theta! Take 
him out and stone him!” 
Someone on the other side 
of the hall echoed the cry. In 
a moment it seemed that eve- 
ryone was roaring it, rising 
in their seats, shaking fists. 
The Senior Elder motioned 
to the Hallmaster. He stepped 
forward with two husky as- 
sistants who grabbed Henry. 

“Put him in the strong 
room,” quavered the Senior 
Elder. “Keep him there until 
the day for punishment.” 
Roughly Henry was 
pushed around, led out a rear 
door to the stage. The day of 
punishment ! Three nights 
and two days to live! 

H e awoke the morning of 
the third night feeling 
cold. He opened his eyes to 



find himself in total dark- 
ness. 

For a moment he thought 
himself free, hiding out in 
some deserted building, that 
all that had happened lately 
was a dream. But from out- 
side he heard a panicky voice 
crying that the lights in hi« 
apartment were out and it 
was getting cold. 

It had happened! Far soon- 
er than be expected, it had 
happened ! 

But what would Theta do? 
She had gotten away, he was 
sure, as no one mentioned her. 
Theta, that was it! She had 
gone to the plant, pushed the 
button, condemning herself 
and all the others to death! 
But that was not like Theta. 
She was too clever... 

That was it ! Why hadn’t he 
thou2,‘ht of it! It was a mes- 
sage, a challenge, a tool 
which he could use to free 
himself — get them to help 
him ! 

More relaxed, he lay back. 
Dawn was already showing 
up over the ridge. More peo- 
ple would be getting up, more 
people rushing out into the 
streets in panic. They would 
remember him, come to his 
cell imploring him to do 
something. He would demand 
what he wanted. They could 
comply— or face disaster. 

What should he demand? 

Someone came down the 
street shouting for the Sen- 
ior Elder. The volume of 
excited voices increased with 
each minute: voices demand- 



78 



CHARLES MINOR BLACKFORD 




ing to know why there was 
no light, no heat, no water. 
Asking each other if they 
had them. Hysteria mounting 
each minute. 

Perhaps it would be a time 
before they thought of him, 
but they would be before him 
before the day was over. 

*‘It’s that witch in the 
strong room!” bellowed Ole’s 
voice outside. “He did it by 
magic ! Kill him before he 
strikes us all dead!” 

The cry was taken up, “The 
witch, kill the witch! He did 
it! He is right in there, kill 
him !” 

Cold terror seized Henry. 

Theta’s scheme was back- 
firing! There would be no 
reasoning with a supersti- 
tious, hysterical mob! Well, 
at least it hurried things up 
by a few hours. More com- 
posed, he came to his feet as 
they burst through the back 
door of the Hall and stam- 
peded towards the door to the 
cell. 

He even smiled slightly. If 
they thought him a witch,.. 

The key was in the lock. 
They had no difficulty get- 
ting in. He stood in the cen- 
ter of the room, the slight 
smile still on his lips. 

He raised his forearm to a 
horizontal position, pointed 
his index finger in their di- 
rection. 

“Who wants to die first?” 
he cried above the noise they 
made. 

The onrush into the cell 
stopped abruptly, those in 

THE VALLEY OF THE MASTERS 



front pushing back against 
those t^hind them. They fol- 
lowed his finger with fasci- 
nated eyes as he fanned it 
across the group of them. He 
stopped, his finger pointing 
to a fat, applecheeked grove- 
master. The man shrieked, 
turned about and began 
fighting his way back into 
the corridor. 

One man was tripped up 
and fell. There was a wild 
shriek of terror. Men shout- 
ed that he was killing the 
leaders by magic. To Henry 
it seemed only an instant be- 
fore the passageway was 
back in its usual silence. He 
stepped out of his cell. He 
could see a mass of people 
about the street door sur- 
rounding the panicked men. 
The passage in the other di- 
rection seemed empty. 

He turned that way, passed 
onto the rear of the stage, 
felt his way across it in the 
darkness to the steps and 
down into the aisle. Calmly 
and without haste he passed 
through the front doors into 
the next street and walked, 
unrecognized in the half light 
and excitement, out of town. 

TT was dark when he arrived 

in the upper valley. 

Theta was sitting at a ta- 
ble. She sprang up and 
rushed into his arms with a 
glad cry. 

“It worked! They let you 
go?” 

He looked about. “You 
turned the power back on?” 



79 




“No. The plant and these 
buildings have a separate 
power source of their own. I 
wasn’t going to touch it until 
I knew you were safe.” 

He drew an apple from a 
bin and munched it. “We’d 
better turn things on again 
before the fruit spoils. Come 
on. 

The button, Henry knew, 
turned on as well as off. Hen- 
ry pressed down the button, 
stepped back to watch the 
large battery of lights flash 
on, but nothing happened. 
Had Theta somehow wrecked 
— ah! The red buttons all be- 
gan to glow again. Then, a 
minute later, a bank of lights 
switched to green, then an- 
other and anoStier. But Henry 
noted that an occasional light 
did not change. 

Within the hour the board 
was lighted up completely. 

Henry could barely stum- 
ble back to his quarters as the 
reaction set in compounded 
with disappointment. He 
flung himself on his bed. 

“I have failed,” he kept 
muttering. “I have failed in 
everything. They won’t lis- 
ten. No one will!” 

Theta wisely kept silent 
and covered him up. 

On the second day they 
heard the sound of a group 
breaking their way through 
the forest. They slipped into 
the brush, ready to retire to a 
hiding place they had ready. 
But the dozen people who ap- 
peared in the clearing did not 
have the look of a vengeful 

80 



mob. Several were almost eld- 
erly, some were boys, two 
were young women. 

Henry stepped into the 
open, but not too close to 
them. “What do you want?” 
he demanded. 

They looked at each other, 
waiting for the other to 
speak first. 

“What do you want?” Hen- 
ry directed his question to an 
elderly grovemaster. 

“I want to know what’s 
happening,” he began. “My 
hopper has stopped working, 
my defrosters were dimming. 
They blame me ...” 

A young man, strong, with 
alert eyes, stepped forward. 
“You are right about that 
other valley,” he said. “I have 
been in it myself. I don’t 
want that to happen here. I 
want to learn.” 

“I do too!” shrilled one of 
the teenagers. “I sneaked into 
a learning house, too, but I 
couldn’t understand.” 

The others gave their rea- 
sons, all varied, but with the 
same intent: they wanted to 
learn. Sometimes how to re- 
pair an individual object, oth- 
ers longed for general knowl- 
edge. But they were willing 
to face the rest of the valley 
with him to get it. 

Henry took a deep, happy 
breath. There would be oth- 
ers. Slowly but surely the 
group would grow. 

“Come in,” he said. “Rest 
and cat. Then we’ll start mak- 
ing plans.” END

MONOLITHS AND 
MIRACLES 



S OME years ago this de- 
partment, wearing, and re- 
acting with, short pants, read 
in Weird Tales an enchant- 
ing story written in that 
pulp-poetic style which was 
so easy to come by then, and 
which is so seldom seen any 
m<M^; it was about a bird 
type ET whose space ship 
landed here to be met (I for- 
get the exact circumstances) 
by a prosodic misfit with 
whom this bird fell in love- 
real-love. The point, I think, 
was that it had to be love- 
real-love, extra-m u n d a n e, 
even ethereal, because noth- 
ing else was possible, this 
chick being a chick. At the 
end she popped him into her 
space ship and off they went 
into infinity murmuring 
poems to each other. 

I didn’t understand the 
lovc-rcal-love bit at that age 
and at this age I still don’t. 
What made the story stick in 
my mind so was that once 
they were aboard she reached 



out the claw he wasn’t hold- 
ing and plucked a string 
which gave out a deep pure 
note, upon which the doors 
slid shut and the ship took 
off. 

It pleased me because in 
those days, as in these days, 
sf’s space ships were one tan- 
gled mass of wiring, controls 
were toggles, rheostats, jew- 
el-lights, dials, meters and 
buttons, and gross operations 
like opening doors or dispos- 
ing of dishes were done with 
handwheels and levers. Eve- 
ry time I was flung a bowl of 
this electrical spaghetti with 
relay sauce I swallowed it. 
But there was always some- 
thing about it that didn’t 
quite agree with me. 

I T was not until many years 
later, when I saw a folio of 
f i f t y-year-old pen-and-ink 
drawings which purported to 
predict the future— our pres- 
ent — that I realized what had 
bothered me about the clut- 

81 





tered consoles and the braid- 
ed festoons of wire under 
them. 

These drawings were in 
many respects astute and 
thoughtful predictions. There 
were aircraft and there were 
streets choked with traffic 
and there were clusters of 
tall buildings. That the build- 
ings ran only eight and nine 
stories and the aircraft were 
mostly blimp-like balloons 
were errors only in degree ; 
the artist certainly had the 
right idea. The one thing in 
which he was dead wrong 
was in the nature of the traf- 
fic, which, but for some bicy- 
cles and a handcart or two, 
was exclusively horse-drawn. 

It simply never occurred to 
the man that one day soon 
there just wouldn’t be any 
horses in the streets. 

It’s an easy mistake to 
make, and one can forgive it 
in the sf of the thirties. It is 
not so easy to forgive in to- 
day’s space yarns. One of the 
balloons in the folio was pow- 
ered by two horses running 
on a treadmill. Most of the 
space-ship controls in cur- 
rent sf are operated by IBM 
cards or tapes, which in its 
way is quite as ludicrous; the 
computer is merely hitched, 
like the horses, to the same 
old knobs and dials. 

It would seem that a good 
hard creative effort needs to 
be made to give our faithful 
readers a glimpse of some- 
thing in the future at least as 
original as a pure-plucked 

82 



string. Especially since here- 
and-now science bids fair to 
relegating circuits and wiring 
to the bin where they threw 
the gasoliers. 

A recent release from 
Westinghouse contains three 
diagrams of a device — it hap- 
pens to be a light telemeter- 
ing system — and a listing of 
components and specifica- 
tions for each. Yesterday*s 
had a volume of 4 cubic 
inches, weighed 26 grams, had 
an input of 5 watts, 16 com- 
ponents, 18 soldered connec- 
tions. Today*s takes up 1 cu- 
bic inch, weighs 7 grams, 
eats ^ of a watt, has 14 parts 
and 15 soldered junctions. 
Tomorrow's (and that means 
tomorrow morning, gentle 
reader) takes up less than a 
thousandth of a cubic inch, 
weighs a fiftieth of a gram, 
uses three fiftieths of a watt, 
has (count ’em) one compo- 
nent, and two soldered junc- 
tions. 

This isn’t miniaturization; 
not exactly. Miniaturization 
does wonders as far as it 
goes, as for example whra 
they packed a whole radio 
transmitter and receiver, as 
well as pulse-counting, arm- 
ing, power supply and firing 
gear, into the front end of 
anti-aircraft shell. a space 
that wouldn’t accomodate two 
king-size decks of cigarettes. 
Make everything smaller and 
you shuck off dead weight 
and increase ruggedness; you 
pay dearly for it in increased 
demands for precision and in 

MONOLITHS AND MIRACLES 




the acquisition of some truly 
vicious problems in heat dis- 
sipation. 

W ESTINGHOUSE (and 
others) have attacked the 
problem from a totally new 
direction. Investigating the 
nature of solids, and especial- 
ly those puzzling substances 
called semi-conductors, they 
have come up with a long 
string of what they call ‘‘mo- 
lecular electronic systems” 
and have already taken them 
out of the laboratory-curiosity 
stage. They have a phono- 
graph hooked up to a dime- 
sized preamp and a half-dol- 
lar-sized amplifier which de- 
livers an honest 5 watts at a 
clean frequency response 
from 0 to 20,000 cycles. They 
have a thing no bigger than a 
biscuit where 110 volts AC 
goes in one side and 9 volts 
DC comes out the other — ^9 
DC volts without waver or 
flicker. They can show you 
a radio with two amplifying 
stages which will tune right 
across the broadcast band and 
which consists of a stack of 
six wafers each smaller than 
a dime. If you’d like to get 
technical, they’ll demon- 
strate a number of thumbnail- 
sized monoliths — a word 
which means ‘single rock’ — 
which are respectively a 2- 
stage video amplifier, a fre- 
q u e n c y-selective amplifier 
with notch filter in a feed- 
back loop around the ampli- 
fier structure; a choice selec- 
tion of multivibrators; a vari- 
able potentiometer; a goodly 
THEODORE STURGEON 



number of multiposition 
switches; an analog-to-digital 
converter ; and a two-stage 
peltier-effect cooler for bring- 
ing the temperatures of infra- 
red detectors down to effi- 
cient-handling levels. 

Had enough? The research- 
ers haven’t. For example, 
they’ve done away with the 
old frequency-crystal, sand- 
wich-transistor techniques of 
sawing ingots, x-ray orient- 
ing, lapping, etching and pol- 
ishing. They don’t so much 
make monoliths as grow them. 
They can grow, a pure germa- 
nium ribbon, an eighth of an 
inch wide and a few thou- 
sandths thick, continuously at 
6 to 12 inches a minute; 
and still that isn’t all. They 
can carry on diffusion, 
plating and evaporation proc- 
esses on the c r y s t a 1 as it 
leaves the melt, producing, 
just for example, a string of 
miniscule amplifiers which 
can be cut off at any length 
to give any desired gain. 
And as if that were not 
enough, they are just perfect- 
ing a process for the continu- 
ous production of two-and 
t h r e e-layer sandwiches of 
these semiconductors, so that 
soon they’ll have really so- 
phisticated, infinite sma 1 , 
starve-at-the-input flood-at- 
the-output devices by the 
yard. 

Isn’t it past time, then, to 
get the horses off the streets 
and the washboards out of the 
back yard, and clean up those 
control consoles? END

The 

Girls 

From 

Fieu 

Dayol 

They were lovely and 
quick to leorn — 
and their only faults 
were little ones! 



U P until the motoient when 
he first looked into Hip- 
polyte Adolphe Taine’s His- 
tory of English Literature, 
Herbert Quidley's penchant 
for old books had netted him 
nothing in the way of romance 
and intrigue. Not that he was 
a stranger to either. Far from 
it. But hitherto the back- 
ground for both had been bed- 
rooms and bars, not libraries. 

On page 21 of the Taine 
tome he happened upon a 
sheet of yellow copy paper 
folded in four. Unfolding it, 
he read: 

asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf 
;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj 
asdf ;lkj 

Cai: Si ties tow ms copeis

fot ig habe mot toseo

snoll doper — Klio, asdf 
;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj 
asdf ;lkj 

Since when, Quidley won- 
dered, refolding the paper and 
putting it back in the book, 
had high-school typing stu- 
dents taken to reading Taine? 
Thoughtfully he replaced the 
book on the shelf and moved 
deeper into the literature sec- 
tion. 

He had just taken down 
Xenophon’s Anabasis when 
he saw the girl walk in the 
door. 

Let it be said forthwith that 
old books were not the only 
item on Herbert Quidley’s 



84 



ROBERT F. YOUNG 




penchant-list. He liked old 
wood, too, and old paintings, 
not to mention old wine and 
old whiskey. But most of all 
he liked young girls. He es- 
pecially liked them when they 
looked the way Helen of Troy 
must have looked when Paris 
took one gander at her and 
started building his ladder. 
This one was tall, with hya- 
cinth hair and liquid blue 
eyes, and she had a Grecian 
symmetry of shape that would 
have made Paris’ eyes pop had 
he been around to take notice. 
Paris .wasn’t, but Quidley’s 
eyes, did the job. 

After coming in the door, 
the girl deposited a book on 
the librarian’s desk and head- 
ed for the literature section. 
Quickly Quidley lowered his 
eyes to the Anabasis and 
henceforth followed her prog- 
ress out of their corners. 
When she came to the O’s she 
paused, took down a book and 
glanced through it. Then she 
replaced it and nwved on to 
the P’s. .the Q’s. .the R’s. 
Barely three feet from him 
she paused again and took 
down Trine’s History of Eng- 
lish Literature. 

He simply could not believe 
it. The odds against two per- 
sons taking an interest in so 
esoteric a volume on a single 
night in a single library were 
ten thousand to one. And yet 
there was no gainsaying that 
the volume was in the girl’s 
hands, and that she was rif- 
fling through it with the air 
of a seasoned browser. 

THE GIRLS FROM FIEU DAYOL 



Presently she returned the 
book to the shelf, selected an- 
other — ^seemingly at random — 
and took it over to the librari- 
an’s desk. She waited statu- 
esquely while the librarian 
processed it, then tucked it 
under her arm and whisked 
out the door into the misty 
April night. As soon as she 
disappeared, Quidley stepped 
over to the T’s and took Taine 
down once more. Just as he 
had suspected. The makeshift 
bookmark was gone. 

He remembered how the 
asdf-;lkj exercise had given 
way to several lines of gibber- 
ish and then reappeared again. 
A camouflaged message? Or 
was it merely what it ap- 
peared to be on the surface — 
the efforts of an impatient 
typing student to type before 
his time? 

He returned Taine to the 
shelf. After learning from the 
librarian that the girl’s name 
was Kay Smith, he went out 
and got in his hardtop. The 
name rang a bell. Halfway 
home he realized why. The 
typing exercise had contained 
the word ''Cai”, and if you 
pronounced it with hard c, 
you got “Kai”— or “Kay”. Ob- 
viously, then, the exercise had 
been a message, and had been 
deliberately inserted in a book 
no average person would 
dream of borrowing. 

By whom — her boy friend? 

Quidley winced. He was al- 
lergic to the term. Not that he 
ever let the presence of a boy 
friend deter him when he set 

85 




out to conquer, but because 
the term itself brought to 
mind the word^ ^^fiance,” and 
the word “fiance” brought to 
mind still another word, one 
which repelled him violently. 
I.e., “m a r r i a g e”. Just the 
same, he decided to keep 
Taine's History, under obser- 
vation for a while. 

H er boy friend turned out 
to be her girl friend, and 
her girl friend turned out to 
be a tall and lissome, lovely 
with a Helenesque air of her 
own. From the vantage point 
of a strategically located 
reading table, where he was 
keeping company with his fa- 
vorite little magazine. The 
Zeitgeist, Quidley watched 
her take a seemingly haphaz- 
ard route to the shelf where 
Taine’s History reposed, take 
the volume down, surreptiti- 
ously slip a folded sheet of 
yellow paper between its 
pages and return it to the 
shelf. 

After she left he wasted no 
time in acquainting himself 
with the second message. It 
was as unintelligible as the

Well, perhaps not quite as 
unintelligible. He knew, at 
least, who Cai was, and he 
knew — from the reappear- 
ance of the words wotnid, 
Fieu Dayol and snoll doper 
— that the two communica- 
tions were in the same code. 
And certainly it was reason- 
able to assume that the 
last word — Yoolna — ^was the 
name of the girl he had just 
seen, and that she was a dif- 
ferent person from the Klio 
whose name had appended 
the first message. 

He refolded the paper, re- 
placed it between the pages, 
returned the book to the 
shelf and went back to the 
reading table and The Zeit- 
geist. 

Kay didn’t show up till al- 
most closing time, and he 
was beginning to think that 
perhaps she wouldn’t come 
around for the pickup till to- 
morrow when she finally 
walked in the door. She em- 
ployed the same tactics she 
had employed the previous 
night, arriving, as though by 
chance, at the T-section and 
transferring the message 
with the same undetectable 
legerdemain to her purse. 
This time, when she walked 
out the door, he was not far 
behind her. 

She climbed into a sleek 
convertible and pulled into 
the street. It took him but a 
moment to gain his hardtop 
and start out after her. 
When, several blocks later, 
she pulled to the curb in

front of an all-night coffee 
bar, he followed suit. After 
that, it was merely a matter 
of following her inside. 

He decided on Operation 
Spill-the-sugar. It had stood 
him in good stead before, 
and he was rather fond of it. 
The procedure was quite 
simple. First you took note 
of the position of the sugar 
dispensers, then you situat- 
ed yourself so that your in- 
tended victim was between 
you and the nearest one, then 
you ordered coffee without 
sugar in a low voice, and af- 
ter the counterman or coun- 
tergirl had served you, you 
waited till he/she was out of 
earshot and asked your i.v. to 
please pass the sugar. When 
she did so you let the dis- 
penser slip from your fin- 
gers in such a way that some 
of its contents spilled on her 
lap — 

‘T’m terribly sorry,** he 
said, righting it. “Here, let 
me brush it off.’* 

all right, it*s only 
sugar,*’ she said, laugh- 
ing. 

“I*m hopelessly clumsy,” 
he continued smoothly, 
brushing the glecuning crys- 
tals from her pleated skirt, 
noting the clean sweep of 
her thighs. “I beseech you to 
forgive me.** 

“You’re forgiven,” she 
said, and he noticed then 
that she spoke with a slight 
accent. 

“If you like, you can send 
THE GIRLS FROM FIEU OAYOL 



it to the cleaners and have 
them send the bill to me. My 
address is 61 Park Place.” 
He pulled out his wallet, 
chose an appropriate card, 
and handed it to her — 
Herbert Quidley : Profiliste 
Her forehead crinkled. 
^^Profilister 

“I paint profiles with 
words,” he said. “You may 
have run across some of my 
pieces in the Better Maga- 
zines. I employ a variety of 
pseudonyms, of course.” 
“How interesting.” She 
pronounced it “anteresting.” 
“Not famous profiles, you 
understand. Just profiles that 
strike my fancy.” He paused. 
She had raised her cup to 
her lips and was taking a 
dainty sip. “You have a rath- 
er striking profile yourself, 
Miss—” 

“Smith. Kay Smith.” She 
set the cup back on the 
counter and turned and faced 
him. For a second her eyes 
seemed to expand till they 
preoccupied his entire vi- 
sion, till he could see noth- 
ing but their disturbingly 
clear — and suddenly cold — 
blueness. Panic touched him, 
then vanished when she said, 
“Would you really consider 
word-painting my profile, 
Mr. Quidley?” 

Would he! “When can I 
call?” 

She hesitated for a mo- 
ment. Then: “I think it will 
be better if I call on you. 
There are quite a number of 

87 




people living in our — our 
house. I’m afraid the quar- 
ters would be much too 
cramped for an artist like 
yourself to concentrate.” 

Quidley glowed. Usually it 
required two or three days» 
and sometimes a week, to 
reach the apartment phase. 
'Tine,” he said. "When can I 
expect you?” 

She stood up and he got to 
his feet beside her. She was 
even taller than he had 
thought. In fact, if he hadn’t 
been wearing Cuban heels, 
she’d have been taller than 
he was. "I’ll be in town night 
after next,” she said. "Will 
nine o’clock be convenient 
for you?” 

"Perfectly.” 

"Good-by for now then, 
Mr. Quidley.” 

He was so elated that when 
he arrived at his apartment 
he actually did try to write a 
profile. His own, of course. 
He sat down at his custpm- 
built chrome-trimmed desk, 
inserted a blank sheet of pa- 
per in his custom-built type- 
writer and tried to arrange 
his thoughts. But as usual his 
mind raced ahead of the mo- 
ment, and he saw the title. 
Self Profile, nestling notice- 
ably on the contents page of 
one of the Better Magazines, 
and presently he saw the 
piece itself in all its splendid 
array of colorful rhetoric, 
sparkling imagery and scin- 
tillating wit, occupying a 
two-page spread. 

It was some time before he 

88 



returned to reality, and 
when he did the first thing 
that met his eyes was the un- 
compromisingly blank sheet 
o<f paper. Hurriedly he typed 
out a letter to his father, re- 
questing an advance on his 
allowance, then, after a tall 
glass of vintage wine, he 
went to bed. 

I N telling him that she 
would be in town two 
nights hence, Kay had unwit- 
tingly apprised him that 
there would be no exchange 
of messages until that time, 
so the next evening he 
skipped his vigil at the li- 
brary. The following eve- 
ning, however, after ready- 
ing his apartment for the 
forthcoming assignation, he 
hied himself to his reading- 
tab 1 e post and took up The 
Zeitgeist once again. 

He had not thought it pos- 
sible that there could be a 
third such woman. 

And yet there she was, 
walking in the door, tall and 
blue-eyed and graceful; dark 
of hair and noble of mien; 
browsing in the philosophy 
section now, now the fiction 
section, now moving leisure- 
ly into the literature aisle 
and toward the T’s . 

The camouflage had var- 
ied, but the message was ty- 
pical enough: 

fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa 
jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; 
fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind en 
snoll doper nckli! Wot- 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




nid antwaterer Fieu 
DayoJ hid jcstig snolJ 
doper iiedererer te. Dep 
gogensplo snoll dopers 
e nsi n g! — Gorka. fdsa 
jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; 
fdsa jkl; 

Judging from the repeated 
use of the words, snoll dop- 
ers were the topic of the day. 
Annoyed, Quidley replaced 
the message and put the book 
back on the shelf. Then he 
returned to his apartment to 
await Kay. 

He wondered what her re- 
action would be if he asked 
her point-blank what a snoll 
doper was ; whether she 
would reveal the nature of 
the amateur secret society to 
which she and Klio and 
Yoolna and Gorka belonged. 
It virtually had to be an ama- 
teur secret society. Unless, of 
course, they were foreigners. 
But what on earth foreign 
organization would be quix- 
otic enough to employ 
Taine’s History of English 
Literature as a communica- 
tions medium when there 
was a telephone in every 
drugstore and a mailbox on 
every corner? 

Somehow the words “what 
on earth foreign organiza- 
tion” got turned around in 
his mind and became “what 
foreign organization on 
earth” and before he could 
summon his common sense to 
succor him, he experienced a 
rather bad moment. By the 
time the door chimes sound- 



ed he was his normal self 
again. 

He . straightened his tie 
with nervous fingers, 
checked to see if his Siirt 
cuffs protruded the proper 
length from his coat sleeves, 
and looked around the room 
to see if everything was in 
place. Everything was — the 
typewriter uncovered and 
centered on the chrome- 
trimmed desk, with the sheaf 
of crinkly first-sheets beside 
it ; the reference books 
stacked imposingly nearby ; 
Harper*s, The Atlantic and 
The Saturday Review show- 
ing conspicuously in the 
magazine rack ; the newly 
opened bottle of bourbon and 
the two snifter glasses on the 
sideboard ; the small table 
set cozily for two — 

T he chimes sounded again. 
He opened the door. 

She walked in with a de- 
mure, “Hello.” He took her 
wrap. When he saw what she 
was wearing he had to tilt 
his head back so that his eyes 
wouldn't fall out of their 
sockets. 

Skin, mostly, in the upper 
regions. White, glowing skin 
on which her long hair lay 
like forest pools. As for her 
dress, it was as though she 
had fallen forward into im- 
maculate snow, half-burying 
her breasts before catching 
herself on her elbows, then 
turning into a sitting posi- 
tion, the snow clinging to her 
skin in a glistening veneer;

arising finally to her feet, 
resplendently attired. 

He went over to the side- 
board, picked up the bottle 
of bourbon. She followed. He 
set the two snifter glasses 
side by side and tilted the 
bottle. “Say when.” “When!” 
“I admire your dress — never 
saw anything quite like it.” 
“Thank you. The material 
is something new. Feel 
it.” “It’s— it’s almost like 
foam rubber. Cigarette?” 
“Thanks... Is something 
wrong, Mr. Quidley?” “No, 
of course not. Why?” “Your 
hands are trembling.” “Oh. 
I'm — I’m afraid it’s the Pres- 
ent company. Miss Smith.” 
“Call me Kay.” 

They touched glasses : 
“Your liquor is as exquisite 
as your living room, Herbert. 
I shall have to come here 
more often.” “I hope you 
will, Kay.” “Though such 
conduct, I’m told, is morally 
reprehensible on the planet 
Earth.” “Not in this particu- 
lar circle. Your hair is love- 
ly.” “Thank you ... You 
haven’t mentioned my per- 
fume yet. Perhaps I’m stand- 
ing too far away . There !” 
«It’s — it’s as lovely as your 
hair, Kay.” “Um, kiss me 
again.” “I — I never figured — 
I mean, I engaged a caterer 
to serve us dinner at 9:30.” 
“Call him up. Make it 10:30.” 

T he following evening 
found Quidley on tenter- 
hooks. The snoll-doper mys- 
tery had acquired a new 



tang. He could hardly wait 
till the next message trans- 
fer took place. 

He decided to spend the 
evening plotting the epic 
novel which he intended to 
write someday. He set to 
work immediately. He plot- 
ted mentally, of course — 
notes were for the hacks and 
the other commercial non- 
geniuses who infested the 
modern literary world. Clos- 
ing his eyes, he saw the 
whole vivid panorama of epic 
action and grand adventure 
flowing like a mighty and 
majestic river before his lit- 
erary vision : the authentic 
and awe-i n s p i r i n g back- 
ground; the hordes of color- 
ful characters; the handsome 
virile hero, the compelling 
Helenesque heroine . God, 
it was going to be great! The 
best thing he’d ever done ! 
See, already there was a 
crowd of book lovers in front 
of the bookstore, staring into 
the window where the new 
Herbert Quidley was on dis- 
play, trying to force its way 
into the jammed interior... 
Cut to interior, FIRST EA- 
GER CUSTOMER: Tell me

bert Quidley left? BOOK

Message no. 4, except for a 
slight variation in camou- 
flage, ran true to form: 

a;sldkfj a;sldk{j a;sldkij 
a;sldkfj Cai: Habe te 

snoll dopers e nsi n g? 
Wotnid ne Fieu Dayol 
ist ifederereret, hid jes- 
tig snoll doper. Gind

a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj 

Quidley sighed. What, he 
asked himself, standing in 
the library aisle and staring 
at the indecipherable words, 
was a normal girl like Kay 
doing in such a childish se- 
cret society? From the way 
she and her correspondents 
carried on you'd almost think 
they were Martian girl 
scouts on an interplanetary 
camping trip, trying for their 
merit badges in communica- 
tions ! 

You could hardly call Kay 
a girl scout, though. 

Nevertheless, she was the 
key figure in the snoll-doper 
enigma. The fact annoyed 
him, especially when he con- 
sidered that a snoll doper, 
for all he knew, could be 
anything from a Chinese for- 
tune cooky to an H-bomb. 

He remembered Kay's odd 
accent. Was that the way a 

THE GIRLS FROM FIEU DAYOL 



person would speak English 
if her own language ran 
something like ifederer- 
et, hid jestig snoll doper 
adwo?** 

He remembered the way 
she had looked at him in the 
coffee bar. 

He remembered the materi- 
al of her dress. 

He remembered how she 
had come to his room. 

^T didn't know you had a 
taste for Taine." 

H er voice seemed to come 
from far away, but she 
was standing right beside 
him, tall and bewitching; 
Helenesque as ever. Her blue 
eyes became great wells into 
which he found himself fall- 
ing. With an effort, he pulled 
himself back. ‘‘You're early 
tonight,” he said lamely. 

She appropriated the mes- 
sage, read it. “Put the book 
back,” she said presently. 
Then, when he complied : 
“Come on.” 

“Where are we going?” 
“I'm going to deliver a 
snoll doper to Jilka. After 
that I'm going to take you 
home to meet my folks.” 

The relieved sigh he heard 
was his own. 

They climbed into her con- 
vertible and she nosed it into 
the moving line of cars. 
“How long have you been 
reading my mail?” she asked. 

“Since the night before I 
met you.” 

“Was that the reason you 
spilled the sugar?” 



91 




‘Tart of the reason,” he 
said. “What’s a snoll doper?** 
She laughed. “I don’t think 
I’d better tell you just yet.” 
He sighed again. “But if 
Jilka wanted a snoll doper,** 
he said after a while, “why in 
the world didn’t she call you 
up and say so?” 
“Regulations.” She pulled 
over to the curb in front of a 
brick apartment building. 
“This is where Jilka lives. 
I’ll explain when I get back.” 
He watched her get out, 
walk up the walk to the en- 
trance and let herself in. He 
leaned his head back on the 
seat, lit a cigarette and ex- 
haled a mixture of smoke and 
relief. On the way to meet 
her folks. So it was just an 
ordinary secret society after 
all. And here he’d been 
thinking that she was the 
key figure in a Martian plot 
to blow up Earth — 

Her folks! 

Abruptly the full implica- 
tion of the words got through 
to him, and he sat bolt-up- 
right on the seat. He was 
starting to climb out of the 
car when he saw Kay coming 
down the walk. Anyway, run- 
ning away wouldn’t solve his 
problem. A complete disap- 
pearing act was in order, and 
a complete disappearing act 
would take time. Meanwhile 
he would play along with 
her. 

A station wagon came up 
behind them, slowed, and 
matched its speed with 



theirs. “Someone’s following 
us,” Quidley said. 

“Probably Jilka.” 

Five minutes later the sta- 
tion wagon turned down a 
side street and disappeared. 
“She’s no longer with us,” 
Quidley said. 

“She’s got to pick someone 
up. She’ll meet us later.” 

“At your folks’?” 

“At the ship.” 

The city was thinning out 
around them now, and a few 
stars were visible in the 
night sky. Quidley watched 
them thoughtfully for a 
while. Then: “What ship?” 
he said. 

“The one we’re going to 
Fieu Dayol on.” 

“F/eu Dayol?** 

“Persei 17 to you. I said I 
was going to take you home 
to meet my folks, didn’t I?” 
“In other words, you’re kid- 
napping me.” 

She shook her head vehe- 
mently, “I most certainly am 
not! Neither according to in- 
terstellar law or your own. 
When you compromised me, 
you made yourself liable in 
the eyes of both.” 

“But why pick on me? 
There must be plenty of men 
on Fieu Dayol. Why don’t 
you marry one of them?” 

“For two reasons: one, 
you’re the particular man 
who compromised me. Two, 
there are not plenty of men 
on Fieu Dayol. Our race is 
identical to yours in every- 
thing except population-bal- 
ance between the sexes. At 



92 



ROBERT F. YOUNG 




periodic intervals the women 
on Fieu Dayol so greatly out- 
number the men that those of 
us who are temperamentally 
and emotionally unfitted to 
become spinsters have to 
look for wotnids— or mates — 
on other worlds. It’s quite le- 
gal and quite respectable. As 
a matter of fact, we even have 
schools specializing in alien 
cultures to expedite our ac- 
tivities. Our biggest prob- 
lem is the Interstellar statute 
forbidding us the use of lo- 
cal communications services 
and forbidding us to appear 
in public places. It was de- 
vised to facilitate the prose- 
cution of interstellar black 
marketeers, but we’re subject 
to it, too, and have to con- 
trive communications sys- 
tems of our own,” 

*‘But why were all the mes- 
sages addressed to you?” 
‘‘They weren’t messages. 
They were requisitions. I’m 
the ship’s stock girl.” 

A pril fields stretched 
darkly away on either side 
of the highway. Presently she 
turned down a rutted road 
between two of them and they 
bounced and swayed back to 
a black blur of trees. “Here 
we are,” she said. 

Gradually he made out the 
sphere. It blended so flaw- 
lessly with its background 
that he wouldn’t have been 
able to see it ^t all if he 
hadn’t been informed of its 
existence. A gangplank 
sloped down from an open 

THE GIRLS FROM FIEU DAYOL 



lock and came to rest just 
within the fringe of the 
trees. 

Lights danced in the dark- 
ness behind them as another 
car jounced down the rutted 
road. “Jilka,” Kay said. “I 
wonder if she got him.” 

Apparently she had. At 
least there was a man with 
her — a rather woebegone, 
wilted creature who didn’t 
even look up as they passed. 
Quidley watched them as- 
cend the gangplank, the man 
in the lead, and disappear 
into the ship. 

“Next,” Kay said. 

Quidley shook his head. 
“You’re not taking me to an- 
other planet!” 

She opened her purse and 
pulled out a small metallic 
object. “A little while ago 
you asked me what a snoll 
doper was,” she said. “Un- 
fortunately interstellar law 
severely limits us in our 
choice of marriageable males, 
and we can take only those 
who refuse to conform to the 
sexual mores o<f their own so- 
cieties.” She did something 
to the object that caused it to 
extend itself into a long, tu- 
bular affair. **This is a snoll 
doper** 

She prodded his ribs. 
“March,” she said. 

He marched. Halfway up 
the plank he glanced back 
over his shoulder for a better 
look at the object pressed 
against his back. 

It bore a striking resem- 
blance to a shotgun* end

T hey said the atom was 
indivisible, and then we 
learned about electrons and 
nuclei. Now we learn that in- 
side the nucleus are neutrons 
and protons, and inside the 
proton is a core surrounded 
by two clouds of positive 
electricity. The neutron has 
a cloud of positive electricity 
surrounding a cloud of nega- 
tive electricity surrounding a 
core, in such a way that the 
electrical total is neutral. The 
clouds are made up of mes- 
ons. Dr. R. Hofstadter of 
Stamford, who informs us of 
all this, says of mesons that 
they are probably units of the 
force that binds the atoms to- 



gether. Dr. W.H. Bostick of 
Stevens Institute reports that 
quantum theory demands that 
elementary particles — ^mes- 

ons, amang some 30 others — 
have infinite mass, and quan- 
tum theorists just have to ig- 
nore this. Dr. Bostick main- 
tains that the particles are 
toroidal, or doughnut-shaped, 
and says that this is the only 
way he can account for what 
physicists have called a mys- 
tery: the particles’ mass, spin, 
charge and magnetic moment. 

Lichens have no roots, and 
this incidental information

all projected science projects, 
the creation of a new harbor 
at Cape Thompson, Alaska, 
by means of atomic bomb 
blasts. It seems that lichens 
absorb many times the fallout 
that rooted plants do, since 
they get it right out of the 
air and not diluted up 
through the ground. Caribou 
eat lichens and Eskimos eat 
caribou. Even now, caribou 
show five times the strontium 
90 in their bones and antlers 
than they should, considering 
that Alaska averages only 
about 20% as much fallout as 
the rest of the country aban- 
doned. 

SCIENCE NON-FICTION 
STORY 

Once upon a time there was 
a clever man named Gernot 
Zippe who was fascinated by 
our efforts to get U-235 out 
of a mixture with U-238 so 
we could make atom bombs. 
We tried it with a centrifuge 
but found it would need one 
which would spin at 40 thou- 
sand rpm without flying to 
bits, so we built one of the 
biggest factories in the world, 
the K-25 plant at Oak Ridge, 
and did it by gaseous diffu- 
sion instead. So Mr. Zippe 
went ahead and designed such 
a centrifuge anyhow and 
while he was interned in Rus- 
sia he built one. Then he 
built another one at the Uni- 
versity of Virginia. Now he’s 
back in Germany and has a 
factory all his own where he 

96 



builds lots of them. Brazil 
just bought two. They only 
cost about five grand apiece, 
and 50 of them could get you 
a hundred pounds of pretty 
pure U-235 in a year, which 
is quite enough for anyone 
an 5 Twhere, wouldn’t you say? 
Talks in Geneva are designed 
to curb bomb manufacture by 
anyone, but Mr. Zippe doesn’t 
mind; the talks take so long. 

We wish this was a science 
fiction story. 

If you drink, don’t tranquil- 
ize, and vice versa, warn re- 
search scientists at Madison 
State Hospital in Indiana. 
Their tests indicate that 
meprobromate, the active in- 
gredient in several tranquiliz- 
ers, adds an alarming amount 
of muscle to that one-for-the- 
road. 

The Argonne National Lab- 
oratory has topped every 
story you’ve ever heard about 
weird Government jobs. They 
hire squirrels. Perhaps “hire” 
is the wrong word; nobody 
pays the squirrels. Dr. T.M. 
Tahmisian hangs around gi- 
ant redwoods until a squirrel 
knocks down a seed cone, 
which he then swipes. The 
purpose is to study the ef- 
fects of radiation on living 
things, and some of this tim-

LORELEI 

By CHARLES V. DeVET 



S EVEN days stranded on 
Europa. Seven days with- 
out hope. The courage that 
had sustained me, like the 
numbness after a fatal blow, 
was beginning to slip away. 
All that seventh day my 
nerves balanced on a thin jag- 
ged edge. And that night the 
anamorph visited me in my 
bubble cubicle. 

I caught the sheathed rus- 
tle of a crinoline skirt and a 
scent of Peri fragrance, and I 
knew she had come. Stubborn- 
ly I kept my face averted, and 
tried my best not to think of 
her. If I did I was lost. My 
fingers dug into the sponge 
fabric beneath me until they 
ached. I sucked breath deep 
into my lungs and held it. 

I wanted no visitors. But 



that of course was why she 
had come. She had a way of 
divining who needed her most, 
the one whose morale was 
nearest breaking. 

'‘Poor Bill,” she murmured. 
She knelt beside me. I felt 
her forehead press against my 
temple and a tear — from eyes 
which I knew would now be a 
clear candid blue, deep in the 
shadows, appearing almost 
black — traced a salty path 
down my cheek. 

The wall of my resistance 
broke. I reached up impulsive- 
ly and pulled her to me. She 
was all soft, yielding femi- 
ninity, live and warm and vi- 
brant, the antidote to the raw 
need that was like a bleeding 
wound deep within. 

Still 1 tried to resist. 1 sum-

moned my last dregs of resist- 
ance and pushed her roughly 
from me. I opened my eyes, 
deliberately keeping my mind 
locked against her. 

She swayed back at my 
shove. 

I saw that her features had 
not yet set into the mold she 
had probed from my mind. 
Her head was round and 
shapeless, with doughy white 
skin and the characterless face 
of a baby. The auburn mat on 
her head was loose and coarse, 
with a consistency that was 
hair and yet not hair; her 
body was too thin, too rigid, 
too stringy. 

Yet she was Lois. Sweet, 
gentle, loving Lois, the bride 
I had left behind on Earth, 
the girl I would never see 
again. Lois. 

My breath came out in a 
ragged sigh of surrender, and 
my mind opened to her un- 
conditionally. 

She altered visibly as I 
watched. It was too late to 
go back now. Lois stood be- 
fore me, full-fleshed and del- 
icately tall, with her rich 
brown hair curling inward 
at the ends, and her shape- 
ly shoulders all honeyed-gold 
from the sun. Her supple lx)dy 
was straight, poised and 
proud, her head back and Jicr 
breasts pressing against her 
blouse. Just as I remembered 
her. 

I could have sent her away 
no more than I could have 
stopped the beat of my heart. 
“Hi, hon/' I whispered* 

98 



She laughed happily, and 
sat on the mat beside me and 
rumpled my hair. We kissed 
gently, tentatively. I pulled 
her closer. As we kissed 
again she kept her eyes open, 
looking at me sidewards in her 
fondly teasing way. “It’s 
good to be back, dear,” she 
breathed against my cheek. 

Long she lay at my side, 
regarding me with eyes that 
were filled with her love, her 
only movement the throb of a 
pulse beneath my fingers as 
they fondled her arched 
throat. I sighed contentedly. 
At the moment I was filled 
with a warm serenity that had 
quite effectively subdued my 
anxiety. 

Once a man let himself go, 
there was no companion, male 
or female, who could com- 
pare with the anamorph. She 
caught his every thought, 
crested the tides of his every 
mood. She became the ideal- 
ization of woman, without 
flaws, formed and molded into 
a perfection beyond possible 
actuality, her beauty and de- 
sirability greater than any real 
woman’s could ever be. 

When full rapport had been 
achieved she was able to keep 
mentally ahead of a man. She 
could gauge his every reflex, 
and match her speech and ac- 
tions to every subtle antici- 
pation. 

I felt almost happy then. 
The tragedy of being stranded 
here was something apart, and 
the reality was the delightful 
woman-creature warm against 
LORELEI 




me. .until at last my passions 
grew sated with the luxuri- 
ance of her charms and I slept. 

I N the morning the anamorph 
was gone. 

Eight other men had fears 
that must be eased. She might 
have spent parts of the night 
with any one or all of them. 
The thought would have been 
distasteful, except that ab- 
sence made the sense of her 
less all-pervading. I even ex- 
perienced a kind of grateful 
relief. I was able to regard her 
now, not as the real Lois I 
wanted, but as merely a source 
of solace 1 had badly needed. 

The anamorph’s presence 
during the night had drained 
all my pent-up frustrations. I 
was not happy, but I no longer 
felt the desperate loneliness 
and need that had goaded me 
before. I dressed leisurely and 
went out into the main com- 
partment of the bubble. 

Except in the sleeping 
rooms the plastic walls were 
transparent. I looked outside 
at the surface of Europa, cov- 
ered with a white material I 
had been told was solid carbon 
dioxide. 

A mild storm was brewing. 
The hydrogen, helium and 
methane in the atmosphere 
were colorless, and the argon 
and krypton too minute to be 
detected without instruments. 
But I could see and hear small 
particles of liquid ammonia as 
they pattered against the plas- 
tic wall. The bubble sagged 
in several places. But there 

CHARLES V. DeVET 



was no danger of it collapsing. 

In the space ship galley (to 
which the bubble had been at- 
tached) I found the captain, 
Mark Burgess, and the ana- 
morph having coffee. 

She was no longer Lois. 
Now she was an older woman, 
with a bit of added weight and 
thickness. She was still beauti- 
ful, but more matronly than 
she had been as Lois. About 
her was none of the warm- 
blooded ardor she had dis- 
played the night before. And 
no remembrance of it in her 
eyes. 

I poured a cup of coffee. 

‘‘Just how long do you fig- 
ure weVe got?’' I asked Bur- 
gess 

“Mr. Lutscher — “ he ad- 
dressed me by my last name, 
as was his custom with junior 
officers — “I will not equivo- 
cate. We have fuel enough to 
furnish us with heat and elec- 
tricity for well over a year. 
But our food will last less 
than two months, even with 
strict rationing.” 

So there it was. In two 
months we’d probably all be 
dead. 

S OMEONE back on Earth 
had erred badly. In their 
calculations every item had 
been gauged closely, as was 
necessary. But they should 
have allowed safety margin. 

The take-off had been calcu- 
lated nicely. Ships had al- 
ready been sent to the moon 
and to Mars. But this was the 
first trip this far out. We had 

99 




not intercepted Europa quite 
as plotted. We had to chase 
it halfway around Jupiter, and 
land with the satellite going 
away, rather than meeting us. 
After we landed and new cali- 
brations been made, we made a 
discovery. Our fuel was too 
short for the return trip. 

Kohnke was our lone hope. 
A metallurgist, he knew the 
properties of the ship’s pile. 

But Kohnke was insane. 

I had not liked the man 
from the first. With his nerv- 
ous, subservient personality, 
he had been a constant irritant 
in the confining quarters 
of the ship. And during the 
early weeks of the flight I 
observed the slow dawning of 
an awful awareness in our 
weak-charactered member. He 
was realizing for the first time 
the prodigious and unpredict- 
able forces to which he had 
exposed himself. Soon he was 
convinced of the certainty of 
death. 

He did not have the mental 
stamina to cope with that 
certainty. When we missed 
Europa on the first pass, 
Kohnke’s mind cracked. 

My attention returned to 
the anamorph. She was staring 
at me now, her features white 
and strained. She must have 
read what I had been thinking 
of Kohnke. 

What was there about the 
crazed man that frightened 
her so? I wondered again. 

I went out into the bubble. 
The rocket man, Andrews and 
100 



I spent the next several hours 
adding another compartment 
to the main room. Andrews 
fed dirt into the hopper of the 
converter while I operated the 
nozzle. 

This was more difficult 
than the original bubble had 
been. Normal air pressure 
was enough to keep that ex- 
panded; but here we had to 
make supports and rig up an 
auxiliary vent. Also it was 
cold near the walls, a cold 
that sucked at the heat in our 
bodies; Europa has a mean 
temperature of -140® Centi- 
grade. 

When our job was finished 
I left Andrews at the door of 
his cubicle. I glanced back and 
saw that he hadn’t gone in. He 
was standing with his head 
down and his shoulders 
slumped. 

Andrews I had always re- 
garded as an extrovert, and a 
good man. He was big, active 
and almost always cheerful. 
Even his bald head seemed to 
add to his masculine virility. 
He had a vast fund of stories. 
Everyone liked him. 

I suspected, however, that 
his bland acceptance of our 
predicament was not all it 
seemed. He was an instinctive 
psychologist. He was doing 
his part to keep up the spirits 
of the rest of us. In my judg- 
ment Andrews was quite a 
man. 

But now his capacity for 
dissimulating had apparently 
reached its limit. 

At that moment a woman- 
LORELEI 




form drifted past me from the 
ship. The anamorph had come 
to perform her self-appointed 
duty. 

She was a robust woman 
now with a body designed for 
love-making, the wide-hipped 
form made to propagate the 
race with healthy offspring. 
Her dress was cut low at the 
neck, innocently immodest. 

Andrews looked up, still 
brooding. 

It was he who had discov- 
ered the anamorph, the second 
day after our landing. Where 
she had come from, or how 
she had gotten through the 
plastic wall without rupturing 
it, we never did learn. She had 
had this identical form when 
Andrews found her. 

The anamorph began to 
dance. A slow, languid pir- 
ouetting. The sound of a word- 
less crooning song reached me. 
The tempo of her dance 
heightened and her wide green 
skirt came up around her 
waist, exposing fair thighs. 

Andrews grunted and shift- 
ed position. Abruptly he 
reached out and grasped her 
wist. “Come here, baby,“ he 
said hoarsely. 

The anamorph kicked and 
squealed in mock protest as 
Andrews swept her off her 
feet and into his arms, but she 
she made no real effort to free 
herself as he strode with her 
into his compartment. 

T he next morning when 
I stopped in with Kohnke's 
breakfast I found him wearing 
a gold crown. 

CHARLES V. DeVET 



With Strictly amateur 
knowledge, I had diagnosed 
his illness as schizophrenia, 
and this latest display seemed 
to confirm the diagnosis. Now 
he had escaped harsh reality 
into a world of his own, a 
world where he was obviously 
a personage of considerable 
eminence. 

Kohnke smiled at me and 
greeted me condescendingly. I 
went along with his delusion. 
If I were to help him it was 
good that he accepted me as 
part of his world. I sat at his 
feet and made as one of the 
unseen audience he was ad- 
dressing. I was wryly amused 
a few minutes later when I 
understood who he thought he 
was. 

However, it was the gold 
crown that fascinated me. 
Where had he gotten it? 
There could be only one an- 
swer. And if what I suspected 
was true, there were startling 
implications. 

I had to speak again soon 
with the anamorph . 

She did not keep me wait- 
ing. 

I returned to my compart- 
ment. The pseudo-Lois en- 
tered soon after and stretched 
out indolently on my cot. 
“You wanted to see me. Bill?"' 

Incongruously I found my- 
self staring at her low-heeled 
shoes, the ones she always 
wore when we danced at the 
Prom. I restrained the impulse 
to take her in my arms. “I 
saw the crown you made for 
Kohnke,” I said carefully, 

iai 




making a special effort to 
keep my inner thoughts hid- 
den. -‘It’s beautiful.” 

“Thank you.” 

Those simple words meant 
much to me. I had succeeded 
in getting her to admit that 
she had made the crown. 

Which meant we still had a 
chance ! 

“Then you’ll be able to make 
the fuel we need,” I said 
casually. 

Her expression became 
wary, shifting instantly to 
petulance. She reached over 
and put one hand on my arm. 
“Why do you want to leave 
me. Bill?” 

I TRIED to explain, but 
she couldn’t or wouldn’t un- 
derstand. 

I tried another tack. “Why 
are you afraid of Kohnke?” I 
asked. My theory was that she 
did not understand insanity, 
and so her inability to follow 
the illogical thought processes 
of the demented man fright- 
ened her. 

“He is so intelligent,” she 
startled me by saying. 

“He’s crazy,” I protested. 
‘^‘What is crazy?” 

“His reasoning faculties do 
not function properly.” 

She seemed to be reading my 
thoughts carefully, trying to 
understand better what I 
meant. After a minute she 
smiled and her teeth showed 
white and even against her 
tan, “Isn’t it possible that his 
mind works too swiftly for 
you to follow, and the only 
102 



way you can explain your 
lack of understanding is to 
say that he is insane?’' 

So that was why she feared 
Kohnke. To her he was a 
brilliant intellect. So great 
that she could neither under- 
stand nor influence him as she 
did the others of us. His 
aborted reasoning, his sudden 
shifts of interest, his small 
concern with a situation that 
aroused our distress, were all 
evidence of that superior in- 
tellect. I did not try to dis- 
abuse her of the belief. It 
fitted well with my semi- 
formed plan. 

“He is like the Masters,” 
the anamorph interrupted my 
thoughts. 

I quickly took up the diver- 
sion she offered: I did not 
want her to see what lay in 
my thoughts. Also she had 
aroused my curiosity. “Who 
are the Masters?” I asked. 

“I’m not certain. I think. 
Her voice trailed off. “I’m 
never too sure that what I’m 
thinking are my own thoughts, 
or what I’m reading in your 
mind, or have read in others.” 
she said. “Perhaps if I looked 
away from you . 

“Many years ago the Mas- 
ters landed on this small world 
to make repairs on the meteor 
shield of their space ship,” 
she began again in a low voice. 
“They were passing through 
this part of the Galaxy on 
their way home from a dis- 
tant planet. I belonged to one 
of them. For some reason they 
left me behind when they 
LORELEI 




went away/' She stopped talk- 
ing, saddened by the recollec- 
tion of her desertion. 

I saw her in a new light 
then. She had been a pet, a 
plaything, who perhaps had 
strayed just before ship leav- 
ing time. 

She nodded, smiling bright- 
ly. “A pet,” she exclaimed, 
clapping her hands. ‘-That is 
right.” I realized then, with 
mild astonishment, that she 
was not very intelligent. Her 
apparent wit and sharpness 
before had been only reflec- 
tions of what she read in our 
minds. 

“Are you all Kohnke's 
pets?” she caught me unpre- 
pared. 

I coughed uncomfortably, 
and shook my head. 

H er mood changed. “I've 
been so lonesome. Bill. 
When I do not belong to 
someone I am so unhappy. But 
I won’t be unhappy any- 
more.” For the first time I 
felt sorry for her. 

“Bill?” Her voice was timid. 
“Do you believe I will be pun- 
ished for leaving the Masters? 
I did not mean to.” 

“Who would punish you 
now?” I asked. 

“The Masters’ God. They 
always told me he would pun- 
ish me if I were bad. And he 
is such a terrible God.” Her 
expression became bright with 
hope. “Is your God terrible. 
Bill?” 

I tried to reassure her, to 
pacify this naive creature 

CHARLES V. DeVET 



with her own private terrors, 
but she must have read in my 
mind how our Christian God 
could also be terrible in his 
wrath and justice, for she 
gave a small cry and pulled 
herself close to me. 

Several minutes went by 
while she trembled in my arms 
and wept disconsolately. Fi- 
nally she quieted and in a 
young girl’s voice asked, “May 
I use your hanky, daddy?” 

In surprise I held her out 
from me and saw that now she 
was my daughter, Joanie, with 
her newly bobbed hair, and 
her sweet face still wet with 
tears. 

Of course. While I held her 
I had been thinking of her as 
a child. As my child, Joanie. 

I wiped away her tears and 
blew her nose. 

I thought swiftly. Perhaps 
this was my opportunity. 
Speaking as I would have to 
Joanie I asked gently, “Won’t 
you help us get the fuel we 
need, honey?” 

“I can’t.” Her childish wist- 
fulness was replaced by the 
stubbornness I had encoun- 
tered before. 

I was careful to restrain my 
impatience. “You could come 
with us to Earth,” I argued, 
without raising my voice. 
“You wouldn’t be lonesome 
there.” 

“I couldn’t live that long 
out of the sun,” she answered. 

“How did you live on the 
Master’s ship?” I asked. 

“They could bring the sun- 
light inside. You can’t.” 

103 




“Isn’t there any way we 
could keep you alive?” I 
asked. 

She shook her head. 

Which left nothing except 
my desperate plan. 

B urgess made the prepa- 
rations I requested, with- 
out question, and I returned 
to Kohnke. It took me some 
time to get him in the frame 
I wanted. When he began to 
blubber, ‘‘I want to go home, I 
want to go home,” I led him 
from the ship. 

The anamorph was outside, 
as I knew she would be. The 
men were all in the ship. 

I bowed deeply to Kohnke

and turned to the anamorph. 
“He would speak with you,” I 
said impressively. 

Her eyes widened with ap- 
prehension. I was not con- 
cerned about her reading my 
thoughts now. What she read 
in Kohnke’s mind would be 
more believeable to her. 

“We must have fuel!” I 
shouted at Kohnke. “She can 
give it to us !” I p o i n t e d at 
the anamorph. “Command 
her!” 

Kohnke concentrated his 
wild gaze on the girl and 
mouthed something inaudible. 

The anamorph drew back. 
Her features seemed to lose 
their character, to be melting 
together. 

This was the critical mo- 
ment. “Tell her about your 
Father,” I commanded. 

His lips writhed damply and 
he began again his inarticulate 
muttering. 

The anamorph cried out 
plaintively and covered her 
face with her hands. I shifted 
my attention to the pile of 
soil I had asked Burgess to 
prepare. 

It quivered, flattened. .and 
hardened into six fuel ingots! 

Twenty minutes later we 
were in space. 

Our last glimpse of the ana- 
morph was the dejected figure 
of a small girl, standing alone 
in the middle of the bubble. 

She had had to obey Kohn- 
ke, of course. For she believed 
what she read -in his mind. 

And Kohnke thought he was 
the Son of God. END

T he man with the handker- 
chief mask said, “All 
right, everybody, keep tight. 
This is a holdup.^ 

There were twelve people in 
the bank. There was Mr. 
Featherhall at his desk, refus- 
ing to okay a personal check 
from a perfect stranger. There 
was the perfect stranger, an 
itinerant garage mechanic 
named Rodney (Rod) Strom, 
like the check said. There 
were Miss English and Miss 
Philicoff, the girls in the gild- 
ed teller cages. There was 
Mister Anderson, the guard, 
dozing by the door in his 
brown uniform. There was 
Mrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, de- 
positing her husband’s pay 
check in their joint checking 
account, and with her was her 



ten-year-old son Edward (Ed- 
die) Clayhorn, Junior. There 
was Charlie Casale, getting 
ten dollars dimes, six dollars 
nickels and four dollars pen- 
nies for his father in the gro- 
cery store down the street. 
There was Mrs. Dolly Dan- 
iels, withdrawing money from 
her savings account again. 
And there were three bank 
robbers. 

The three bank robbers 
looked like triplets. From the 
ground up, they all wore 
scuffy black shoes, baggy- 
kneed and unpressed khaki 
trousers, brown -xracked- 
leather jackets over flannel 
shirts, white handkerchiefs 
over the lower half of their 
faces and gray-and-white 
check caps pulled low over

their eyes. The eyes them- 
selves looked dangerous. 

The man who had spoken 
withdrew a small but mean- 
lopking thirty-two calibre 
pistol from his jacket pocket. 
He waved it menacingly. One 
of the others took the pistol 
away from Mister Anderson, 
the guard, and said to him in 
a low voice, “Think about re- 
tirement, my friend.” The 
third one, who carried a black 
satchel like a doctor’s bag, 
walked quickly around behind 
the teller’s counter and start- 
ed filling it with money. 

It was just like the movies. 

The man who had first 
spoken herded the tellers, 
Mr. Featherhall and the cus- 
tomers all over against the 
back wall, while the second 
man stayed next to Mr. An- 
derson and the door. The 
third man stuffed money into 
the black satchel. 

The man by the door said, 
“Hurry up.” 

The man with the satchel 
said, “One more drawer.” 

The man with the gun 
turned to say to the man at 
the door, “Keep your shirt 
on. 

That was all Miss English 
needed. She kicked off her 
shoes and ran pelting in her 
stocking feet for the door. 

T he man by the door spread 
his arms out and shouted, 
“Hey !” The man with the gun 
swung violently back, cursing, 
and fired the gun. But he’d 
been moving too fast, and so 



had Miss English, and all he 
hit was the brass plate on Mr. 
Featherhall’s desk. 

The man by the door caught 
Miss English in a bear hug. 
She promptly did her best to 
scratch his eyes out. Mean- 
while, Mr. Anderson went 
scooting out the front door 
and running down the street 
toward the police station in 
the next block, shouting, 
“Help! Help! Robbery!” 

The man with the gun 
cursed some more. The man 
with the satchel came running 
around from behind the coun- 
ter, and the man by the door 
tried to keep Miss English 
from scratching his eyes out. 
Then the man with the gun 
hit Miss English on the head. 
She fell unconscious to the 
floor, and all three of them 
ran out of the bank to the car 
out front, in which sat a very 
nervous-looking fourth man, 
gunning the engine. 

Everyone except Miss Eng- 
lish ran out after the bandits, 
to watch. 

Things got very fast and 
very confused then. Two po- 
lice cars came driving down 
the block and a half from the 
precinct house to the bank, 
and the car with the four rob- 
bers in it lurched away from 
the curb and drove straight 
down the street toward the 
police station. The police cars 
and the getaway car passed 
one another, with everybody 
shooting like the ships in pi- 
rate movies. 

There was so much confu- 



106 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




sion that it looked as though 
the bank robbers were going 
to get away after all. The po- 
lice cars were aiming the 
wrong way and, as they’d 
come down with sirens wail- 
ing, there was a clear path 
behind them. 

Then, after the getaway car 
had gone more than two 
blocks, it suddenly started 
jouncing around. It smacked 
into a parked car and stopped. 
And all the police went run- 
ning down there to clap hand- 
cuffs on the robbers when 
they crawled dazedly out of 
their car. 

**Hey,” said Eddie Clay- 
horn, ten years old. “Hey, 
that was something, huh, 
Mom?” 

“Come along home,” said 
his mother, grabbing his hand. 
“We don’t want to be in- 
volved.” 

4^TT was the nuttiest thing,” 
■^said Detective-Sergeant 
Stevenson. “An operation 
planned that well, you’d think 
they’d pay attention to their 
getaway car, you know what 
I mean?” 

Detective-Sergeant Pauling 
shrugged. “They always slip 
up,” he said. “Sooner or later, 
on some minor detail, they al- 
ways slip up.” 

“Yes, but their tires/* 
“Well,” said Pauling, “it 
was a stolen car. I suppose 
they just grabbed whatever 
was handiest.” 

“What I can’t figure out,” 
said Stevenson, “is exactly 



what made those tires do that. 
I mean, it was a hot day and 
all, but it wasn’t that hot. And 
they weren’t going that fast. 
I don’t think you could go 
fast enough to melt your tires 
down.” 

Pauling shrugged again. 
“We got them. That’s the im- 
portant thing.” 

“Still and all, it’s nutty. 
They’re free and clear, bar- 
relling out Rockaway toward 
the Belt, and all at once their 
tires melt, the tubes blow out 
and there they are.” Steven- 
son shook his head. “I can’t 
figure it.” 

“Don’t look a gift horse in 
the mouth,” suggested Paul- 
ing. “They picked the wrong 
car to steal.” 

“And that doesn’t make 
sense, either,” said Stevenson. 
“Why steal a car that could 
be identified as easily as that 
one?” 

“Why? What was it, a for- 
eign make?” 

“No, it was a Chewy, two- 
tone, three years old, looked 
just like half the cars on the 
streets. Except that in the 
trunk lid the owner had 
burned in ‘The Scorpion’ in 
big black letters you could see 
half a block away.” 

“Maybe they didn’t notice 
it when they stole the car,” 
said Pauling. 

“For a well-planned opera- 
tion like this one,” said Stev- 
enson, “they made a couple of 
really idiotic boners. It 
doesn’t make any sense.” 

“What do they have to say 

107

about it?" Pauling demanded. 

^‘Nothing, what do you ex- 
pect? They’ll make no state- 
ment at all." 

The squad-room door 
opened, and a uniformed pa- 
trolman stuck his head in. 
''The owner of that Chewy’s 
here,” he said. 

“Right," said Stevenson. He 
followed the patrolman down 
the hall to the front desk. 

The owner of the Chewy 
was an angry-looking man of 
middle age, tall and paunchy. 
“John Hastings," he said. 
“They say you have my car 
here." 

“I believe so, yes," said 
Stevenson. “I’m afraid it’s in 
pretty bad shape." 

“So I was told over the 
phone," said Hastings grimly. 
“I’ve contacted my insurance 
company." 

“Good. The car’s in the po- 
lice garage, around the corner. 
If you’d come with me?" 

O N the way around, Steven- 
son said, “I believe you 
reported the car stolen almost 
immediately after it hap- 
pened." 

“That’s right," said Hast- 
ings. “1 stepped into a bar on 
my route. I’m a wine and 
liquor salesman. When I came 
out five minutes later, my car 
was gone." 

“You left the keys in it?” 
“Well, why not?’" demand- 
ed Hastings belligerently. “If 
I'm making just a quick stop 
— I never spend more than 
five minutes with any one 



customer — I always leave the 
keys in the car. Why not?" 

“The tar was stolen," Stev- 
enson reminded him. 

Hastings grumbled and 
glared. “It’s always been per- 
fectly safe up till now." 

“Yes, sir. In here." 

Hastings took one look at 
his car and hit the ceiling. 
“It’s ruined!" he cried. “What 
did you do to the tires?" 

“Not a thing, sir. That hap- 
pened to them in the hold- 
up." 

Hastings leaned down over 
one of the front tires. “Look 
at that! There’s melted rub- 
ber all over the rims. Those 
rims are ruined ! What did you 
use, incendiary bullets?" 

Stevenson shook his head. 
“No, sir. When that happened 
they were two blocks away 
from the nearest policeman." 

“Hmph." Hastings moved on 
around the car, stopping short 
to exclaim, “What in the name 
of God is that? You didn’t 
tell me a bunch of kids had 
stolen the car." 

“It wasn’t a bunch of kids," 
Stevenson told him. “It was 
four professional criminals, I 
thought you knew that. They 
were using it in a bank hold- 
up." 

“Then why did they do 

thatr 

Stevenson followed Hast- 
ings’ pointing finger, and 
saw again the crudely-lettered 
words, “The Scorpion" burned 
black into the paint of the 
trunk lid. “I really don’t 
know," he said. “It wasn’t

there before the car was 
stolen?” 

‘‘Of course not!” 

Stevenson frowned, “Now, 
why in the world did they do 
that?” 

“I suggest,” said Hastings 
with heavy sarcasm, “you ask 
them that.” 

Stevenson shook his head. 
“It wouldn't do any good. 
They aren't talking about 
anything. I don't suppose 
they'll ever tell us.” He 
looked at the trunk lid again. 
“It's the nuttiest thing,” he 
said thoughtfully. 

That was on Wednesday. 
The Friday afternoon mail 
delivery to the Daily News 
brought a crank letter. It was 
in the crank letter's most ob- 
vious form; that is, the ad; 
dress had been clipped, a let- 
ter or a word at a time, from 
a newspaper and glued to the 
envelope. There was no re- 
turn address. 

The letter itself was in the 
same format. It was brief and 
to the point: 

Dear Mr. Editor: 

The Scorpion has struck. 
The bank robbers were cap- 
tured. The Scorpion fights 
crime. Crooks and robbers are 
not safe from the avenging 
Scorpion. WARN YOUR 
READERS! 

Sincerely yours, 
THE SCORPION 

The warning was duly 
noted, and the letter filed in 
the wastebasket. It didn’t rate 
a line in the paper. 



T he bank robbery occurred 
in late June. Early in Au- 
gust, a Brooklyn man went 
berserk. 

It happened in Canarsie, a 
section in southeast Brooklyn 
near Jamaica Bay. This par- 
ticular area of Canarsie was 
a residential neighborhood, 
composed of one and two fam- 
ily houses. The man who went 
berserk was a Motor Vehicle 
Bureau clerk named Jerome 
Higgins. 

Two days before, he had 
flunked a Civil Service exam- 
ination for the third time. He 
reported himself sick and 
spent the two days at home, 
brooding, a bottle of blended 
whiskey at all times in hts 
hand. 

As the police reconstructed 
it later, Mrs. Higgins had at- 
tempted to awaken him on the 
third morning at seven-thirty, 
suggesting that he really 
ought to stop being so fool- 
ish, and go back to work. He 
then allegedly poked her in 
the eye, and locked her out 
of the bedroom. 

Mrs. Higgins then appar- 
ently called her sister-in-law, 
a Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, 
who was Mr. Higgins' sister. 
Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the 
house at nine o'clock, and 
spent some time tapping at 
the still-locked bedroom door, 
apparently requesting Mr. 
Higgins to unlock the door 
and “stop acting like a child.” 
Neighbors reported to the po- 



DONALD E. WESTLAKE 



109 




lice that they heard Mr. Hig- 
gins ^hout a number of times, 
“Go away ! Can’t you let a man 
sleep?” 

At about ten-fifteen, neigh- 
bors heard shots from the 
Higgins residence, a two- 
story one-family pink stucco 
affair in the middle of a block 
of similar homes. Mr. Higgins, 
it was learned later, had sud- 
denly erupted from his bed- 
room, brandishing a .30-.30 
hunting rifle and, being an- 
noyed at Jhe shrieks of his 
wife and sister, had fired sev- 
en shells at them, killing his 
wife on the spot and wound- 
ing his sister in the hand and 
shoulder. 

Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded 
and scared out of her wits, 
raced screaming out the front 
door of the house, crying for 
the police and shouting, “Mur- 
der! Murder!” At this point, 
neighbors called the police. 
One neighbor additionally 
phoned three newspapers and 
two television stations, there- 
by earning forty dollars in 
“news-tips” rewards. 

B y chance, a mobile televi- 
sion unit was at that mo- 
ment on the Belt Parkway, re- 
turning from having seen off 
a prime minister at Idlewild 
Airport. This unit was at once 
diverted to Canarsie, where it 
took up a position across the 
street from the scene of car- 
nage and went to work with a 
Zoomar lens. 

In the meantime, Mister 
Higgins had barricaded him- 



self in his house, firing at 
anything that moved. 

The two cameramen in the 
mobile unit worked their 
hearts out. One concentrated 
on the movements of the po- 
lice and firemen and neigh- 
bors and ambulance attend- 
ants, while the other used the 
Zoomar lens to search for Mr. 
Higgins. He found him occa- 
sionally, offering the at-home 
audience brief glimpses of a 
stocky balding man in brown 
trousers and undershirt, stalk- 
ing from window to window 
on the second floor of the 
house. 

The show lasted for nearly 
an hour. There were police- 
men everywhere, and firemen 
everywhere, and neighbors 
milling around down at the 
corner, where the police had 
roped the block off, and oc- 
casionally Mr. Higgins would 
stick his rifle out a window 
and shoot at somebody. The 
police used loudspeakers to 
tell Higgins he might as well 
give up, they had the place 
surrounded and could eventu- 
ally starve him out anyway. 
Higgins used his own good 
lungs to shout obscenities 
back and challenge anyone 
present to hand-to-hand com- 
bat. 

The police fired tear gas 
shells at the house, but it was 
a windy day and all the win- 
dows in the Higgins house 
were either open or broken. 
Higgins was able to throw all 
the shells back out of the 
house again. 



110 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




The show lasted for nearly 
an hour. Then it ended, sud- 
denly and dramatically. 

Higgins had showed himself 
to the Zoomar lens again, for 
the purpose of shooting either 
the camera or its operator. All 
at once he yelped and threw 
the rifle away. The rifle 
bounced onto the porch roof, 
slithered down to the edge, 
hung for a second against the 
drain, and finally fell barrel 
first onto the lawn. 

Meanwhile, Higgins was 
running through the house, 
shouting like a wounded bull. 
He thundered down the stairs 
and out, hollering, to fall into 
the arms of the waiting po- 
lice. 

They had trouble holding 
him. At first they thought he 
was actually trying to get 
away, but then one of them 
heard what it was he was 
shouting: “My hands! My 

hands V 

They looked at his hands. 
The palms and the palm-side 
of the fingers were red and 
blistering, from what looked 
like severe burns. There was 
another burn on his right 
cheek and another one on his 
right shoulder. 

Higgins, thoroughly chas- 
tened and bewildered, was led 
away for burn ointment and 
jail. The television crew went 
on back to Manhattan. The 
neighbors went home and tele- 
phoned their friends. 

On-duty policemen had 
been called in from practical- 
ly all of the precincts in 



Brooklyn. Among them was 
Detective - Sergeant William 
Stevenson. Stevenson frowned 
thoughtfully at Higgins as 
that unhappy individual was 
led away, and then strolled 
over to look at the rifle. He 
touched the stock, and it was 
somewhat warm but that was 
all. 

He picked it up and turned 
it around. There, on the other 
side of the stock, burned into 
the wood, were the crudely- 
shaped letters, “The Scorpi- 
on. 

Y OU don’t ,get to be Pre- 
cinct Captain on nothing 
but political connections. 
Those help, of course, but you 
need more than that. As Cap- 
tain Hanks was fond of point- 
ing out, you needed as well to 
be both more imaginative than 
most — “You gotta be able to 
second-guess the smart boys” 
— and to be a complete real- 
ist — “You gotta have both 
feet on the ground.” If these 
were somewhat contradictory 
qualities, it was best not to 
mention the fact to Captain 
Hanks. 

The realist side of the cap- 
tain’s nature was currently at 
the fore. “Just what are you 
trying to say, Stevenson?” he 
demanded. 

“I’m not sure,” admitted 
Stevenson. “But we've got 
these two things. First, there’s 
the getaway car from that 
bank job. The wheels melt for 
no reason at all, and somebody 
burns ‘The Scorpion’ onto the 



DONALD E. WESTLAKE 



111 




trunk. Then, yesterday, this 
guy Higgins out in Canarsie. 
He says the rifle all of a sud- 
den got too hot to hold, and 
he’s got the burn marks to 
prove it. And there on the 
rifle stock it is again. ‘The 
Scorpion’.” 

“He says he put that on 
there himself,” said the cap- 
tain. 

Stevenson shook his head. 
“His lawyer says he put it^on 
there. Higgins says he doesn’t 
remember doing it. That’s 
half the lawyer’s case. He’s 
trying to build up an insanity 
defense.” 

“He put it on there himself, 
Stevenson,” said the captain 
with weary patience. “What 
are you trying to prove?” 

“I tion’t know. All I know 
is it’s the nuttiest thing I ever 
saw. And what about the get- 
away car? What about those 
tires melting?” 

“They were defective,” said 
Hanks promptly. 

“All four of them at once? 
And what about the thing 
written on the trunk?” 

“How do I know?” demand- 
ed the captain. “Kids put it 
on before the car was stolen, 
maybe. Or maybe the hoods 
did it themselves, who knows ? 
What do they say?” 

“They say they didn’t do 
it,” said Stevenson. “And they 
say they never saw it before 
the robbery and they would 
have noticed it if it’d been 
there.” 

The captain shook his head. 
“I don’t get it,” he admitted. 



“What are you trying to 
prove?” 

“I guess,” said Stevenson 
slowly, thinking it out as he 
went along, “I guess I’m try- 
ing to prove that somebody 
melted those tires, and made 
that rifle too hot, and left his 
signature behind.” 

“What? You mean like in 
the comic boois? Come on, 
Stevenson! What are you try- 
ing to hand me?” 

“All I know,” insisted Stev- 
enson, “is what I see.” 

“And all I know,” the cap- 
tain told him, “is Higgins put 
that name on his rifle himself. 
He says so.” 

“And what made it so hot?” 
“Hell, man, he’d been firing 
that thing at people for an 
hour ! What do you think 
made it hot?” 

“All of a sudden?” 

“He noticed it all of a sud- 
den, when it started to burn 
him.” 

“How come the same name 
showed up each time, then?” 
Stevenson asked desperately. 

“How should I know? And 
why not, anyway? You know 
as well as I do these things 
happen. A bunch of teen-agers 
burgle a liquor store and they 
write ‘The Golden Avengers’ 
on the plate glass in lipstick. 
It happens all the time. Why 
not ‘The Scorpion’? It 
couldn’t occur to two peo- 
ple?” 

“But there’s no explana- 
tion — ” started Stevenson. 

“What do you mean, there’s 
no explanation? I just gave 



112 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




you the explanation. Look, 
Stevenson, I'm a busy man. 
You got a nutty idea — like 
Wilcox a few years ago, re- 
member him? Got the idea 
there was a fiend around 
loose, stuffing all those kids 
into abandoned refrigerators 
to starve. He went around try- 
ing to prove it, and getting 
all upset, and pretty soon they 
had to put him away in the 
nut hatch. Remember?" 

"I remember," said Steven- 
son. 

"Forget this silly stuff, 
Stevenson," the captain ad- 
vised him. 

"Yes, sir," said Steven- 
son. 

The day after Jerome Hig- 
gins went berserk, the after- 
noon mail brought a crank let- 
ter to the Daily News: 

< 

Dear Mr. Editor, 

You did not warn your 
readers. The man who shot all 
those people could not escape 
the Scorpion. The Scorpion 
fights crime. No criminal is 
safe from the Scorpion. WARN 
YOUR READERS. 

Sincerely yours, 

THE SCORPION 

Unfortunately, this letter 
was not read by the same in- 
dividual who had seen the 
first one, two months before. 
At any rate, it was filed in 
the same place, and forgotten. 

Ill 

H ALLOWE'EN is a good 
time for a rumble. There's 
too many kids around for the 



cops to keep track of all of 
them, and if you're picked up 
carrying a knife or a length 
of tire chain or something, 
why, you're on your way to a 
Hallowe'en party and you’re 
in costume. You're going as a 
JD. 

The problem was this 
schoolyard. It was a block 
wide, with entrances on two 
streets. The street on the 
north was Challenger terri- 
tory, and the street on the 
south was Scarlet Raider ter- 
ritory, and both sides claimed 
the schoolyard. There had 
been a few skirmishes, a few 
guys from both gangs had 
been jumped and knocked 
around a little, but that had 
been all. Finally, the War 
Lords from the two gangs had 
met, and determined that the 
matter could only be settled 
in a war. 

The time was chosen: Hal- 
lowe'en. The place was cho- 
sen : the schoolyard. The 

weapons were chosen : pocket 
knives and tire chains okay, 
but no pistols or zip-guns. 
The time was fixed: eleven 
P.M. And the winner would 
have undisputed territorial 
rights to the schoolyard, both 
entrances. 

The night of the rumble, the 
gangs assembled in their sep- 
arate clubrooms for last-min- 
ute instructions. Debs were 
sent out to play chicken at 
the intersections nearest the 
schoolyard, both to warn of 
the approach of cops and to 
keep out any non-combatant

kids who might come wander- 
ing through. 

Judy Canzanetti was a Deb 
with the Scarlet Raiders. She 
was fifteen years old, short 
and black-haired and pretty in 
a movie-magazine, gum-chew- 
ing sort of way. She was 
proud of being in the Auxil- 
iary of the Scarlet Raiders, 
and proud also of the job that 
had been assigned to her. She 
was to stand chicken on the 
southwest corner of the street. 

Judy took up her position 
at five minutes to eleven. The 
streets were dark and quiet. 
Few people cared to walk this 
neighborhood after dark, par- 
ticularly on Hallowe’en. Judy 
leaned her back against the 
telephone pole on the corner, 
stuck her hands in the pock- 
ets of her Scarlet Raider jack- 
et and waited. 

At eleven o’clock, she heard 
indistinct noises begin behind 
her. The rumble had started. 

At five after eleven, a bunch 
of little kids came wandering 
down the street. They were 
all about ten or eleven years 
old, and most of them carried 
trick-or-treat shopping bags. 
Some of them had Hallowe’en 
masks on. 

They started to make the 
turn toward the schoolyard. 
Judy said, “Hey, you kids. 
Take off.” 

One of them, wearing a red 
mask, turned to look at her. 
“Who, us?” 

“Yes, you! Stay out of that 
street. Go on down that way.” 

“The subway’s this way,” 

114 



objected the kid in the red 
mask. 

“Who cares? You go around 
the other way.” 

ISTEN. lady,” said the 
"kid in the red mask, ag- 
grieved, “we got a long way 
to po to get home.” 

“Yeah,” said another kid, in 
a black mask, “and we’re late 
as it is.” 

“I couldn’t care less,” Judy 
told them callously. “You 
can’t go down that street.” 
“Why not?” demanded yet 
another kid. This one was in 
the most complete and elab- 
orate costume of them all, 
black leotards and a yellow 
shirt and a flowing black cape. 
He wore a black and gold 
mask and had a black knit cap 
jammed down tight onto his 
head. “Why can’t we go down 
there?” this apparition de- 
manded. 

“Because I said so,” Judy 
told him. “Now, you kids get 
away from here. Take off.” 
“Hey!” cried the kid in the 
black-and-yellow costume. 
“Hey, they’re fighting down 
there !” 

“It’s a rumble,” said Judy 
proudly. “You twerps don’t 
want to be involved.” 

“Hey!” cried the kid in the 
black-and-yellow costume 
again. And he went running 
around Judy and dashing off 
down the street. 

“Hey, Eddie !” shouted one 
of the other kids. “Eddie, 
come back!” 

Judy wasn’t sure what to do 
CALL HIM NEMESIS 




next. If she abandoned her 
post to chase the one kid 
who’d gotten through, then 
maybe all the rest of them 
would come running along af- 
ter her. She didn’t know what 
to do. 

A sudden siren and a dis- 
tant flashing red light solved 
her problems. “Cheez,” said 
one of the kids. “The cops!” 

“Fuzz!” screamed Judy. 
She turned and raced down 
the block toward the school- 
yard, shouting, “Fuzz! Fuzz! 
Clear out, it's the fuzz!” 

But then she stopped, wide- 
eyed, when she saw what was 
going on in the schoolyard. 

. The guys from both gangs 
were dancing. They were 
jumping around, waving their 
arms, throwing their weapons 
away. Then they all started 
pulling x)ff their gang jackets 
and throwing them away, 
whooping and hollering. They 
were making such a racket 
themselves that they never 
heard Judy’s warning. They 
didn’t even hear the police 
sirens. And all at once both 
schoolyard entrances were full 
of cops, a cop had tight hold 
of Judy and the rumble was 
over. 

Judy was so baffled and ter- 
rified that everything was 
just one great big blur. But 
in the middle of it all, she 
did see the little kid in the 
yellow-and-black costume go 
scooting away down the 
street. 

And she had the craziest 
idea that it was all his fault. 



C APTAIN Hanks was still 
in his realistic cycle this 
morning, and he was impa- 
tient as well. “All right, Stev- 
enson,” he said. “Make it fast, 
I’ve got a lot to do this morn- 
ing. And I hope it isn’t this 
comic-book thing of yours 
again.” 

“I’m afraid it is. Captain,” 
said Stevenson. “Did you see 
the morning paper?” 

“So what?” 

“Did you see that thing 
about the gang fight up in 
Manhattan?” 

Captain Hanks sighed. 
“Stevenson,’' he said wearily, 
“are you going to try to con- 
nect every single time the 
word 'scorpion' comes up? 
What's the problem with this 
one? These kid gangs have 
names, so what?” 

“Neither one of them was 
called ‘The Scorpions,' ” Stev- 
enson told him. “One of them 
was the Scarlet Raiders and 
the other gang was the Chal- 
lengers.” 

“So they changed their 
name,” said Hanks. 

“Both gangs? Simultaneous- 
ly? To the same name?” 
“Why not? Maybe that’s 
what they were fighting 
over.” 

“It was a territorial war,” 
Stevenson reminded him. 
“They’ve admitted that much. 
It says so in the paper. And 
it also says they all deny ever 
seeing that word on their 
jackets until after the fight.” 
“A bunch of juvenile delin- 
quents,” said Hanks in dis- 



116 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




gust. ‘"You take their word?” 
“Captain, did you read the 
article in the paper?” 

“I glanced through it.” 

“All right. Here’s what they 
say happened: They say they 
started fighting at eleven 
o’clock. And they just got go- 
ing when all at once all the 
metal they were carrying — 
knives and tire chains and 
coins and belt buckles and 
everything else — got freezing 
cold, too cold to touch. And 
then their leather jackets got 
freezing cold, so cold they had 
to pull them off and throw 
them away. And when the 
jackets were later collected, 
across the name of the gang 
on the back of each one had 
been branded ‘The Scorpion.’ ” 
“Now, let me tell you some- 
thing,” said Hanks severely. 
“They heard the police sirens, 
and they threw all their weap- 
ons away. Then they threw 
their jackets away, to try to 
make believe they hadn’t been 
part of the gang that had been 
fighting. But they were 
caught before they could get 
out of the schoolyard. If the 
squad cars had showed up a 
minute later, the schoolyard 
wouldn’t have had anything in 
it but weapons and jackets, 
and the kids would have been 
all over the neighborhood, 
nice as you please, minding 
their own business and not 
bothering anybody. That’s 
what happened. And all this 
talk about freezing cold and 
branding names into jackets 
is just some smart-alec punk’s 



idea of a way to razz the po- 
lice. Now, you just go back 
to worrying about what’s 
happening in this precinct 
and forget about kid gangs 
up in Manhattan and comic 
book things like the Scorpion, 
or you’re going to wind up 
like Wilcox, with that re- 
frigerator business. Now, I 
don’t want to hear any more 
about this nonsense, Steven- 
son. 

“Yes, sir,” said Stevenson. 

T he reporter showed up 
two days later. He was 
ushered into the squad room, 
where he showed his press 
card to Stevenson, smiled 
amiably and said, “My editor 
sent me out on a wild-goose 
chase. Would you mind chat- 
ting with me a couple min- 
utes?” 

“Not at all,” said Stevenson. 
The reporter, whose press 
card gave his name as Tom 
Roberts, settled himself com- 
fortably in the chair beside 
Stevenson’s desk. “You were 
the one handled that bank job 
down the street back in June, 
weren’t you?” 

Stevenson nodded. 

Roberts gave an embar- 
rassed chuckle and said, 
“Okay, I’ve got just one ques- 
tion. You answer no, and then 
we can talk about football or 
something. I mean, this is just 
a silly wild-goose chase, 
frankly. I’m a little embar- 
rassed about it.” 

“Go ahead and ask,” Stev- 
enson told him.

"Okay, I will. Was there 
the word ‘scorpion’ connected 
with that bank job at all? In 
any way at all.” 

Stevenson looked at the re- 
porter and smiled. He said, 
"As a matter of fact, Mr. Rob- 
erts, there was.” 

Roberts blinked. "T here 
was?” 

"Yes, indeedy. There cer- 
tainly was.” And Stevenson 
told him the full story of the 
bank job. 

"I see,” said Roberts dazed- 
ly when Stevenson was fin- 
ished. "I see. Or, I don’t see. 
I don’t see it at all.” 

"Your turn,” Stevenson told 
him. "Now you tell me what 
made you ask that.” 

"This,” said Roberts. He 
reached into the inside pocket 
of his sport jacket and with- 
drew a business-size envelope, 
which he handed over to 
Stevenson. 

It was another crank letter, 
in the same newspaper clip- 
ping form as the first two. It 
read : 

Dear Mr. Editor, 

The bad boys were captured. 
They could not escape the Scor- 
pion. I left the mark of the 
Scorpion on their jackets. 
Criminals fear the mark of the 
Scorpion. They cannot escape. 
This is my third letter to you. 
You should warn all criminals 
to leave the city. They cannot 
escape the Scorpion. WARN 
YOUR READERS. 

Sincerely yours, 
THE SCORPION 

Stevenson read the letter. 
"Well, well,” he said. 



"He says that’s the third 
letter,” Roberts pointed out. 
"We asked around in the of- 
fice, and we found out who 
got the first two. They were 
both back a ways. The first 
one was early in the summer, 
and the guy who read it re- 
membered it said something 
about a bank robbery. So I 
was sent out this morning to 
check up on bank robberies 
in June and July. You’re the 
third one I’ve talked to this 
morning. The first two fig- 
ured me for some kind of 
nut.” 

441 i^Y Captain figures me 
^^-■•the same way,” Steven- 
son told him. "What about the 
second letter? Or, wait, don’t 
tell me. I’ll tell you. It’s that 
guy in August, the one who 
ran amok over in Canarsie.” 
"Right you are,” said Rob- 
erts. "How did you know?” 
"I was there. He left his 
mark on the rifle stock.” 
"Okay,” said Roberts. "So 
there’s something in it, after 
all.” 

"There’s something in it,” 
said Stevenson. "The question 
is, what?” 

"Well,” said Roberts, "what 
have we got so far? Some- 
body — call it person or per- 
sons unknown, for the fun of 
it — is stepping in every once 
in a while when there’s a 
crime being committed. He 
stops it. He calls himself the 
Scorpion, and he uses some 
pretty dizzy methods. He 
melts automobile tires, makes

a rifle too hot to hold, makes 
knives and leather jackets ice 
cold — how in heck does he do 
things like that?*' 

‘‘Yeah/’ said Stevenson. 
‘"And just incidentally, who 
is he?'’ 

“Well,” said Roberts, “he's 
a kid, that much is obvious. 
That whole letter sounds like 
a kid. Talking about ‘the bad 
boys' and stuff like that.” 
“What do you figure, some 
scientist's kid maybe?” 
“Maybe,'* said Roberts. “His 
old man is working on some- 
thing in his little old labora- 
tory in the cellar, and every 
once in a while the kid sneaks 
in and makes off with the ray 
gun or whatever it is.” Rob- 
erts laughed. “I feel silly even 
talking about it,” he said. 

“I'd feel silly, too,” Steven- 
son told him, “if I hadn't seen 
what this kid can do.” 

“Can we work anything out 
from the timing?” Roberts 
asked him. “He seems to show 
up once every couple of 
months.” 

“Let me check.” 

Stevenson went over to the 
filing cabinet and looked up 
the dates. “The bank job,” he 
said, “was on Wednesday, 
June 29th. At eleven o'clock 
in the morning. That Higgins 
guy was on — here it is — Fri- 
day, August 5th, around noon. 
And this last one was on Hal- 
lowe’en, Monday, October 
at eleven o'clock at 
night.” 

“If you can see a pattern 
in there,” Roberts told him. 



“you're a better man than I 
am.” 

“Well, the first two,” Stev- 
enson said, “were in the day- 
time, during the summer, 
when school was out. That’s 
all I can figure.” 

“Why just those three?” 
Roberts asked. “If he's out to 
fight crime, he's pretty ineffi- 
cient about it. He's only gone 
to work three times in four 
months.” 

“Well, he's a kid,” said 
Stevenson. “I suppose he has 
to wait until he stumbles 
across something.” 

“And then rush home for 
Daddy's ray gun?” 

Stevenson shook his head. 
“It beats me. The only one 
that makes sense is the sec- 
ond one. That one was tele- 
vised. He probably saw it that 
way. The other two times, he 
just happened to be around.” 
“I don't know,” said Rob- 
erts. “Does a kid happen to 
be around twice in four 
months when there's crimes 
being committed? Now, the 
Hallowe’en thing, I can see 
that. A kid is liable to be out 
wandering around, nnaybe go 
off to a strange neighborhood 
after he's done with his trick- 
or-treat stuff. Hallowe'en is a 
good time for a kid to sec 
some other kids breaking a 
law. And the thing in Canar- 
sie, like you say, he probably 
saw that on television. But 
what about the bank job?” 
“That was the first,” said 
Stevenson thoughtfully. “That 
was what set him off. He was

there at the time. Just by ac- 
cident. And he saw they were 
getting away, so he zapped 
them. And right away he put 
the drama into it, right on the 
spur of the moment he decid- 
ed to be the Scorpion. Then 
he sent the letter to your pa- 
per. But nothing else hap- 
pened, and the paper didn’t 
print anything about his let- 
ter or what he’d done, and he 
kind of forgot about it. Until 
he was watching television 
and saw the Higgins thing. 
Pow, the Scorpion rides again. 
And then it died down again 
until a couple of nights ago 
he saw the rumble, and pow 
all over again.” 

^What you’re saying,” Rob- 
erts told him, *'is that this kid 
wanders around with Daddy’s 
zap gun all the time. That 
doesn’t seem very likely.” 
”Face it,” said Stevenson. 
‘‘Daddy’s zap gun isn’t the 
likeliest thing I ever heard 
of, either. I don’t know how 
the kid does this. For that 
matter, it’s only an educated 
guess that it’s a kid we’re af- 
ter.” 

“Okay,” said Roberts. “So 
what do we do now?” 

“Now,” said Stevenson, “I 
think we talk to the captain. 
And then I have a feeling 
we’ll be talking to the FBI.” 

IV 

J UDY Canzanetti was a 
frightened girl. First, there 
had been that crazy thing in 
the schoolyard, and then be- 



ing dragged in by the police, 
and then being chewed out by 
Mom, and now here she was 
being dragged in by the po- 
lice again, for absolutely 
nothing at all. 

They were all there, in the 
big empty room like a gym- 
nasium in the police station, 
the guys and debs from both 
gangs, all milling around and 
confused. And the cops were 
taking all the kids out one at 
a time and questioning them. 

When the cop pointed at 
her and said, “Okay. You 
next,” Judy almost broke into 
tears. 

This wasn’t like anything 
she knew or anything she 
could have expected. This 
wasn’t like after the rumble, 
with the guys wisecracking 
the cops, and nothing to wor- 
ry about but a chewing-out 
from Mom. This was scary. 
They were taking people out 
one at a time to question them. 
And nobody was coming back 
into the room, and who knew 
what happened to you when 
it was your turn? 

“Come on,” said the cop. 
“Step along.” 

She stepped along, numb 
and miserable. 

There were four men in the 
room to which she was led. 
They were sitting behind a 
long table, with notebooks and 
pencils and ashtrays on the 
table. In front of them was a 
straight-backed armless chair. 
The cop sat her down in the 
chair, and left the room. 

One of the men said, “Your 



120 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




name is Judy Canzanetti, is 
that right?” 

“Yes, sir.” It came out a 
whisper. She cleared her 
throat and tried again. “Yes, 
sir.” 

“You don’t have to be 
frightened, Judy,” said the 
man. “You aren’t going to be 
accused of anything. My 
name is Marshall, Stephen 
Marshall. This gentleman on 
my right is Stewart Lang. 
We’re with the FBI. That 
gentleman there is Mr. Stev- 
enson, and he’s a detective 
from Brooklyn. And that 
there is Mr. Roberts, and he’s 
a reporter. And we all simply 
want to ask you one or two 
questions. All right?” 

The man was obviously try- 
ing to calm her down, make 
her relax. And he succeeded 
to some extent. Judy said, 
“Yes, sir,*’ in a small voice 
and nodded, no longer quite 
so frightened. 

None of the four men were 
particularly frightening in ap- 
pearance. The two FBI men 
were long and lean, with bleak 
bony faces like cowboys. The 
detective v/as a short worried- 
looking man with a paunch 
and thinning black hair. And 
the reporter was a cheerful 
round-faced man in a loud 
sport coat and a bow tie. 

“Now,” said Marshall, “you 
were present at the time of 
the gang fight on Hallowe’en, 
is that right?” 

“Yes, sir. Well, no, sir. Not 
exactly. I was down at the 
corner.” 



Mister Marshall smiled 
briefly. “On Jookout?” he 
asked. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I see. And do you remem- 
ber seeing anyone present at 
all aside from the boys in the 
two gangs and the police?” 

^^^1*0, sir. That is, not ex- 
•■“^cept a bunch of little 
kids. They came along just 
before the co — the police.” 
“A bunch of little kids?” 
The detective named Stev- 
enson said urgently, “Did you 
recognize any of them?” 

“No, sir. They weren’t from 
around the neighborhood.” 
Marshall said, “You’d nev- 
er seen them before?” 

“No, sir. They were just a 
bunch of little kids. Grade 
school kids. They were out 
with costumes on and every- 
thing, playing trick-or-treat.” 
“Did they go near the 
schoolyard at all?” 

“No, sir. Except for one of 
them. You see, I was supposed 
to keep people away, tell them 
to go around the other way. 
And these kids came along. 
I told them to go around the 
other way, but they said they 
had to get to the subway.” 
“The subway?” echoed 
Stevenson. 

“Yes, sir. They said they 
were out too late anyway and 
it was a long way to go to get 
home.” 

The man named Marshall 
said, “You said one of them 
did go down by the school- 
yard?” 



DONALD E. WESTLAKE 



121 




^Yes, sir. I told them all 
to go around the other way 
and the one kid said, ‘Hey, 
they’re fighting,’ or something 
like that, and he ran down 
the street. I tried to stop him. 
But he got away from me.” 
“And then what hap- 
pened?” asked Stevenson. 

“Then I saw the fuzz — the 
police coming. I ran down to 
warn everybody. And all the 
guys were jumping around 
throwing their coats away.” 
“And the little boy?” 

“I didn’t see him at all any 
more. Except after the police 
came. I saw him go running 
around the corner.” 

“What did this boy look 
like?” Stevenson asked. 

“Gee, I don’t know, sir.” 
“You don’t know?” 

“No, sir. He was in his Hal- 
lowe’en costume.” 

The four men looked at one 
another. “A costume,” said the 
one named Roberts, the re- 
porter. “My God, a costume.” 
“Yes, sir,” said Judy. “It 
was all black and gold. Tight 
black pants and a yellow shirt 
and a black cape and a funny 
kind of mask that cov’ered his 
face, black and gold. And a 
kind of cap like maybe a skull 
cap* on his head, black, only 
it was knit. Like the sailors 
wear in the Merchant Ma- 
rine.” 

“Black and gold,” said Rob- 
erts. He seemed awed by 
something. 

“So you can’t identify this 
boy at all,” said Stevenson 
forlornly. 



“One of the other kids 
called him Eddie,” she said, 
suddenly remembering. 

They spent fifteen minutes 
more with her, going over the 
same ground again and again, 
but she just didn’t have any 
more to tell them. And finally 
they let her go. 

M r. Featherhall and Miss 
English were distant but 
courteous. It was, after all, 
banking hours. On the other 
hand, these four men were 
police and FBI, on official 
business. 

“It has been a rather long 
time,” Featherhall objected 
gently. “Well over four 
months.” 

“It seemed to me,” said Miss 
English, “that the police took 
the names of all the people 
who’d been here at the time 
of the robbery.” 

“There may have been oth- 
er people present,” suggested 
Marshall, “who left before the 
confusion was over. There are 
any number of people in this 
world who like to avoid being 
involved in things like this.” 
“I can certainly appreciate 
their position,” said Miss 
English, reminiscently touch- 
ing her fingertips to her head. 

“Miss English was very 
brave,” Featherhall told the 
policemen. “She created the 
diversion that spoiled their 
plans.” 

“Yes, we know,” said Mar- 
shall. “We’ve heard about 
what you did. Miss English.” 
“To tell you the truth,” she

said primly, was most con- 
cerned about the boy. To be 
exposed to something like 
that at his tender — ” 

"‘Boy?” interrupted Steven- 
son rudely. “Did you say 
boyr 

“Why, yes,” said Miss Eng- 
lish. “There was a little boy 
in here at the time, with his 
mother. Didn’t you know?” 
“No, we didn’t,” said Mar- 
shall. “Could you describe 
this boy?” 

“Well, he was — ^well, not 
more than ten years old, if 
that. And he — well, it has 
been a long time, as Mr. 
Feathedhall said. He was just 
a child, a normal average 
child.” 

“Not exactly average,” said 
Stevenson cryptically. 

“You said he was in here 
with his mother,” said Mar- 
shall. 

“That’s right. I’ve seen her 
in here a number of times.” 
“Yes, of course,” said Mar- 
shall. 

“Has she been here since 
the robbery?” asked Steven- 
son. 

“Yes, I believe she has.” 
“So that you would recog- 
nize her if you saw her again.” 
“Yes, I would. I’m sure I 
would. She almost always 
comes in with the boy. Or, 
no, she doesn’t, not any more. 
Not since school started. But 
she did all summer.” 

“She comes in often, then.” 
“1 believe so,” said Miss 
English. “Fairly often.” 
Marshall produced a small 

d6NALD C. WESTLAKE 



card, which he handed to Miss 
English. “The next time she 
comes in,” he said, “we’d ap- 
preciate it if you’d call us at 
that number. Ask for me, Mr. 
Marshall.” 

“I will,” said Miss English. 
“I surely will.” 

T he four of them sat talk- 
ing in Marshall’s office. 
Tom Roberts had his shoes 
off, his feet on the window- 
sill, his spine curved into the 
chair and a cigarette dangling 
from the corner of his mouth. 
He had 'one eye closed and 
was sighting between his 
socked feet at the building 
across the way. 

“The thing that bothers 
me,” he said, the cigarette 
waggling in his mouth, “is 
just that I’m sure as I can 
be that I’ll never get to write 
a word of this story. You 
gimlet-eyed types will clamp 
down on this kid, and that’ll 
be the end of it. Security, by 
George. National defense. I 
wonder whatever happened to 
freedom of the press.” 

“The press overworked it,” 
Marshall told him. 

“The thing is,” said Lang, 
“whatever weapon or machine 
this boy is using, it’s some- 
thing that the government 
knows absolutely nothing 
about. Wc’vc sent up a report 
on the effects of this thing, 
whatever it is, and there’s 
been the damnedest complete 
survey of current government 
research projects you can 
imagine. There is nothing at 



123 




all like it even on the draw- 
ing boards.” 

“Whatever the boy is us- 
ing,” said Marshall, “and 
wherever he got it from, it 
isn’t a part of the govern- 
ment’s arsenal of weapons.” 

“Which it has to be,” Lang 
added. “Can you imagine a 
weapon that selectively in- 
creases or decreases the tem- 
perature of any specific ob- 
ject or any specific part of 
an object? From a distance? 
I wouldn’t like to be sitting 
on a stockpile of hydrogen 
warheads with somebody aim- 
ing that weapon at me. He 
simply presses the ‘hot’ but- 
ton, and blooey!” 

“You see a jet bomber com- 
ing,” said Marshall. “You 
point the weapon, press the 
‘cold’ button, and flame-out. 
That pilot bought the farm.” 

“What rd like to know,” 
said Lang, “is where he got 
his hands on this thing in the 
first place. Not only is there 
no machine or weapon we 
know of which can do this 
sort of thing, but our tame 
experts assure us that no such 
machine or weapon is possi- 
ble.’^ 

“Great,” said Stevenson. 
“We’re looking for a ten-year- 
old kid armed with a weapon 
that no adult in the country 
could even imagine as possi- 
ble.” 

The phone rang at that 
point, and for a second no 
one moved. They all sat and 
looked at the jangling phone. 
Then Marshall and Lang 



moved simultaneously, but it 
was Marshall who answered. 
“Marshall here.” 

The others watched him, 
heard him say, “Yes, Miss 
English. Right.” And reach 
forward on the desk for pad 
and pencil. “Right, got it. 
You’re sure that’s the one? 
Right. Thank you very 
much.” 

Marshall cradled the phone, 
and looked at the others. “The 
woman came in. Her name is 
Mrs. Albert J. Clayhorn, and 
she lives on Newkirk Avenue. 
Miss English said the number 
would be near East 17th.” 

“Five blocks from the 
bank,” said Stevenson. 

“And about eighty blocks 
from Higgins’ house,” said 
Roberts. “That’s why it took 
him so long to go to work 
that time. He saw what was 
happening on television, 
grabbed his weapon and his 
trusty bike and went riding 
out to Canarsie. The Scorpion 
rides again!” 

Marshall looked at his 
watch. “It’s only a little after 
one,” he said. “We can talk 
to the mother before the boy 
comes home.” 

“Right,” said Stevenson, 
getting to his feet. 

V 

M rs. Elizabeth Clayhorn 
was a short, roundish, 
pleasant-faced woman in a 
flower-pattern apron. She 
looked at the identification 
Marshall showed her, and 



124 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




smiled uncertainly. ‘^FBI? I 
don’t under — Well, come in.” 
--Thank you.” 

The living room was neat 
and airy. The four men set- 
tled themselves. 

Marshall, uncomfortably, 
was the spokesman. -I’m go- 
ing to have to explain this, 
Mrs. Clayborn,” he said, -and 
frankly, it isn’t going to be 
easy. You see — ” He cleared 
his throat and tried again. 
-Well, here’s the situation. 
Someone in New York has a 
rather strange machine of 
some sort — ^well, it’si sort of 
a heat machine, I suppose you 
could say — and we’ve traced 
it, through its use, to, uh — 
well, to your son.” 

-To Eddie?” Mrs. Clay- 
horn was looking very blank. 
-Eddie?” 

-I take it,” said Marshall, 
instead of answering, -that 
your son hasn’t told you about 
this machine.” 

-Well, no. Well, of course 
not. I mean, he’s just a little 
boy. I mean, how could he 
have any sort of machine? 
What is it, a blowtorch, some- 
thing like that?” 

“Not exactly,” said Mar- 
shall. -Could you tell me, Mrs. 
Clayhorn, what your husband 
does for a living?” 

-Well, he runs a grocery 
store. The Bohack’s up on 
Flatbush Avenue.” 

-I see.” 

Lang took over the ques- 
tioning. -Are there any other 
persons living here, Mrs. 
Clayhorn? Any boarders?’* 



-No, there’s only the three 
of us.” 

-Well, is Eddie interested 
in anything of a, well, a sci- 
entific nature? In school, per- 
haps?” 

-Oh, Lord, no. He hasn’t 
had any real science subjects 
yet. He’s only in the fifth 
grade. His best subject is his- 
tory, but that’s because he 
likes to read, and history is 
all reading. He got that from 
me, I read all the time.” 

-He doesn’t have one of 
these junior chemistry sets, 
then, or anything like that?” 
-No, not at all. He just isn’t 
interested. We even got him 
an Erector set last Christmas, 
and he played with it for a 
day or two and then gave it 
up completely and went back 
to reading.” 

-The thing is,” said Stev- 
enson, with ill-concealed des- 
peration, -he does have this 
machine.” 

-Are you sure it’s Eddie?” 
-Yes, mam, we’re sure.” 
-Mrs. Clayhorn,” said Mar- 
shall, “the boy does have this 
machine. The government is 
very interested in it, and — ” 
-Well, I don’t see how a 
ten-year-old boy — but if you 
say so, then I suppose it’s so. 
Of course, he’ll be home from 
school at three-thirty. You 
could ask him, if you want.” 

44Ty/E’D rather not, just 
yet,” said Marshall. 
-We think it might not be 
the best idea. As you say, Ed- 
die is very interested in read-

ing. He’s been using this ma- 
chine, and, uh, well, he’s been 
making a big secret out of it, 
like the characters in comic 
books. We wouldn’t want to 
spoil that secret for him, at 
least not until we actually 
have the machine in our own 
possession.” 

see,” said Mrs. Clayhorn 
doubtfully. 

“Mam,” said Stevenson, “we 
don’t have any sort of search 
warrant. Bift we would like to 
take a look in Eddie’s room, 
with your permission.” 

“Well, if you really think 
it’s important — ” 

“It is,” said Marshall. 
“Then, I suppose it’s all 
right. It’s the door on the 
right, at the end of the hall.” 
The three men, feeling 
1 r g e ^ and^ cumbersome, 
searched the boy’s room. It 
was a boy’s room, nothing less 
and nothing more. The closet 
floor and shelves were stacked 
with comic books, there were 
baseball trading cards in the 
top bureau drawer, there were 
pennants on the walls. There 
was no heat machine, nor any 
hint of a heat machine. 

“I just don’t know,” said 
Marshall at last. 

“Unless he carries it all the 
time,” said Lang, 

“S u r e,” said Stevenson. 
“That’s why he had it with 
him in the bank that day.” 
“Maybe,” said Marshall. “I 
just don’t know. You know, 
I don’t really believe there is 
a machine.” 

“Of course there is,” said 



Stevenson. “We’ve seen what 
it can do.” 

“Oh, I’m not denying the 
boy caused those things. But 
I just have the completely in- 
sane conviction that there 
isn’t any machine.” Marshall 
shrugged. “Ah, well, never 
mind. Let’s go back and 
soothe the mother.” 

They soothed her, which 
took some doing, not because 
she was at all worried, but 
because she was so curious 
she could hardly sit still. But 
Marshall, by looking very 
stern and official, and by 
speaking in round long-sylla- 
bled sentences, finally con- 
vinced her that the welfare of 
the nation was absolutely de- 
pendent upon her not men- 
tioning anything at all about 
this visit to Eddie, under any 
circumstances. 

“We’ll be back to talk to 
the boy in a day or two,” Mar- 
shall told her. “In the mean- 
time, we’d prefer him not to 
be forewarned.” 

“If you say so,” she said, 
frowning. 

T he school principal, a 
gray battleship named 
Miss Evita Dexter, was irate. 
The idea that pornographic 
materials were being sold in 
her schoolyard was absurd. It 
was ridiculous. It was un- 
heard-of. 

Stevenson assured her that, 
adjectives notwithstanding, it 
was happening. And they were 
going to have a shakedown of 
the student body whether

Miss Dexter liked it or not. 
Detective-Sergeant Stevenson 
and his associates, Marshall 
aiid Lang, were going to go 
through the student body with 
a fine tooth comb. 

Neither Marshall nor Lang 
had mentioned the fact that 
they were from the FBI. 

The search began at nine 
forty-five in the morning, and 
ended at ten past twelve. 

On the persons of three 
eighth-grade boys, they found 
pornographic photos. 

On the person of Eddie 
Clayhorn, they found abso- 
lutely nothing... 

Abner Streitman Long was 
a government expert. He was 
more or less a government ex- 
pert in the ready reserve, 
since he had never once been 
called upon to use his ex- 
pertise for the government. 

Not until now. 

Abner Streitman Long was 
Resident Professor of Psy- 
chology at Mandar Universi- 
ty. He was also one of the 
world’s foremost and best- 
known experimenters in the 
area of parapsychology, also 
called Extra-Sensory Percep- 
tion, also called psionics. 

The government, as a mat- 
ter of principle, didn’t believe 
in psionics. But the govern- 
ment, also as a matter of prin- 
ciple, kept a psionics expert 
handy, just in case. 

The “just in case’* had may- 
be happened. 

Professor Long sat in Mar- 
shall’s office and listened 
stolidly to the problem. The 

DONALD E. WESTLAKE 



expert was a tall, barrel-chest- 
ed man with a fantastic shock 
of white hair exploding out 
in all directions from his 
head. His nose was bulbous, 
his jaw out-thrust, his eyes 
deepset, his ears hairy, his 
hands huge and his feet huger. 
He looked like a dressed-up 
lumberjack, of the old school. 

He listened, and they 
talked, and every once in a 
while he nodded . and said, 
“Huh.” His voice was, pre- 
dictably, basso profundo. 

T hen they were finished, 
and P r o f e s^s o r Long 
summed it all up. “He changes 
the temperature of objects. 
Yes?” 

“Yes,” said Marshall. 

“You looked for a machine. 
Yes?” * - * 

“Yes, and we didn’t find it.” 
“And your thermodynamics 
people said no such machine 
could exist anyway, yes?” 
“That’s right.” 

“Then why did you look for 
it?” - 

“Because,” said Marshall 
desperately, “we’d seen it in 
action. That is, we’d seen the 
result of its use.” 

“Yes,” said the professor. 
He sucked on his lower lip 
and abstractedly watched his 
thumbs twiddle. “Pyrotic,” he 
announced at last. 

“I beg your pardon?” asked 
Marshall. 

“Pyrotic,” repeated the pro- 
fessor. “Yes? Yes. Pyrotic. Do 
you know what that is?” 
“No/’ said Marshall. 

127 




‘'Good/' said the professor. 
‘‘Neither do I. But I have a 
theory. There are more the- 
ories than there are phenom- 
ena. That always happens. But 
listen to this theory. The 
mind reaches into the object 
on the molecular level, and ad- 
justs the molecules, so. The 
temperature changes. Do you 
see?'' 

“Not exactly,'' said Mar- 
shall doubtfully. 

“Neither do I. Never mind. 
I know lots of theories, none 
of them make any sense. But 
they all try to explain." 

“If you say so," said Mar- 
shall. 

“Yes. I say so. Now. As a 
psychologist, I will tell you 
something else. This boy has 
made this a secret, yes? The 
Scorpion, he calls himself, 
and, like his heroes of the 
comic books, he uses his pow- 
er for good. Shazam, yes? 
Captain Marvel." 

“Yes," said Stevenson, nod- 
ding emphatically. 

“Now, what happens if you 
go to this boy and tell him, 
‘We know you are the Scorpi- 
on? Your secret is out.' What 
happens then?" 

“I don't know," said Mar- 
shall. 

“Think,” suggested Profes- 
sor Long. “Batman, let us 
say, or Superman. Quite apart 
from fighting crime, what is 
the major task confronting 
these heroes? That of main- 
taining the secrecy of their 
identity, yes?" 

The four men nodded. 



“Now,'^ said Professor 
Long, “to the mind of a ten- 
year-old boy, what is the im- 
plication? The implication is 
this : If the secret of the iden- 
tity is lost the power of the 
hero is also lost. This is the 
clear implication. Yes?" 

“You mean this boy 
wouldn't be able to do it any 
more if we went and talked 
to him?" asked Lang. 

“I don't say that," cau- 
tioned the professor. “I do 
say this: He will believe that 
he has lost the power. And 
this belief may be sufficient 
to destroy the power. Yes?" 

“In other words," said Mar- 
shall, “you're saying that we 
can’t ask this boy how he 
manages his stunt, because if 
we do then he probably won't 
be able to manage it any 
more." 

A distinct possibility," 
said the professor. “But 
only a temporary possibility. 
The drama of the Scorpion 
will not, I imagine, survive 
puberty." 

“But will the ability survive 
puberty?” 

“No one can know. No one 
can even guess." 

“Now, here's the thing,” 
said Marshall. “Not down- 
grading your theories at all, 
Professor, they are neverthe- 
less still only theories. Frank- 
ly, given my choice between 
an impossible machine and a 
boy with the power to think 
things hot and cold, I'll give 
the impossible machine the 



128 



CALL HIM NEMESIS 




edge. At this point, accepting 
the idea of the machine, our 
next move is simple. We go 
ask the boy to give it to us. 
From what you say, we can't 
even do that.” 

‘‘My best advice,” said the 
professor, “would be to keep 
the boy under careful surveil- 
lance for the next three or 
four years. Gradually get to 
know him, carefully work out 
a long-range program involv- 
ing his reading habits, the at- 
titudes of his teachers and 
parents, the sort of external 
stimuli to which he is — ” 

“Fellas,” said Roberts sud- 
denly. “Oh, fellas.” 

They turned to look at him. 
He was in his favorite pose, 
shoes off, feet up on the win- 
dowsill. He was now pointing 
at the window. “Do you fel- 
las see what I fella see?” he 
asked them. 

They saw. The window was 
frosting. It was a rainy, hu- 
mid mid-November day, and 
moisture was condensing on 
the window pane. It was con- 
densing, and then it was 
freezing. 

It didn't take long. No 
more than a minute passed 
from the time Roberts no- 
ticed the thing beginning un- 
til the time it was complete. 
And then they watched vari- 
ous specific sections of the 
window defrost again. 

It was a very strange look- 
ing window. It was covered 
with frost, but there were 
lines of bare window, as 
though the frost had been 

DONALD E. WESTLAKE 



scraped away. The lines 
formed letters, and the letters 
formed words, and the words 
were : 

POO. MOM TOLD ME. 

“My God,” said Marshall. 

“Well, well, well, well, 
well,” said Stevenson. 

“Yes,” said Professor Long. 
He nodded, and turned away 
from the window to look at 
the door. “You may come in 
now, Eddie,” he called. 

The door opened, and Ed- 
die Clayhorn stood there, in 
civilian clothes. He beamed at 
the window. “That was 
tricky,” he said. 

“So,” said Professor Long. 
“I was mistaken, eh? Expo- 
sure does not spoil things, is 
that it?” 

“Sometimes,” said Eddie 
Clayhorn, “the hero has one 
or two trusted friends on the 
police force who know who 
he is and give him tips about 
criminals. But they never tell 
anybody.” 

“Of course!” said Professor 
Long. “And we are your 
trusted friends. Yes?” 

“Sure. But you can't tell my 
parents or anybody.” 

Roberts leaned forward and 
gingerly touched the frosted 
window. It was cold, very 
cold. He turned and looked 
with awed eyes at Eddie 
Clayhorn. 

Slowly, he smiled. “Scorp 
old boy,” he said, “you can 
just call me Tonto. Kimo- 
sabe !” END

HUE AND CRY 

G ood to hear from all! It’s nice to get a mailbag full 
of comments and suggestions, especially when so many of 
them show so much hard thinking about what ought to go into 
making up a first-class science-fiction magazine. 

Regrarding the kind of stories, I am reasonably sure that most of the 
readers want stories that make them THINK, and which deal with cur- 
rent trends, such as The Junkmakers. The present trend to planned 
obsolescence must be reversed, also too great conformity and many other 
aspects of our time. Your writers can do this. I am a profound believer 
that the pen is mightier than the sword. 

Leslie D. Carr 
Wiiichendon, Massachusetts 

Our writers can do anything! — Anything, that is, except 
know how to satisfy readers who don’t send letters in to give 
us the benefit of their opinion. 

When I received the July If in the mail about two weeks ago and hap- 
pened to glance at the back page . • . Suffice it to say that 1 almost faint- 
ed when I saw my name there! I enjoyed all the features this time; but 
shouM really appreciate an editorial. Book reviews would be happily 
welcomed back. Please run a lettered that takes from 10-16 pages of 
the mag and don’t print those shorty things ... I would also be extremely 
pleased to see a fanzine review appear in If. 

Lawrence Crilly 
Elizabeth, New Jersey 

Let’s see. We won’t be running an editorial, book reviews or 
fanzine reviews for at least the immediate future; we won’t 
be running 10 to 16 pages of letters ever (unless the editor 
goes out of his mind) ; and we will, as you see, run ‘‘shorties” 
—even when we have to cut them! 

Lawrence, you just can’t win ’em all. 

If needs a letter column. The only way for an S-F mag to improve its 
quality is for the readers to get on the ball and tell the editor what 
needs impiwement. 

My big gripe about If is the distribution. In this town there hasn’t been 
one copy on the newsstands for over a year. If you want your circulation 
to improve, get If on the newsstands where people can buy it. 

Irwin Sternberg, Jr. 
Tucson, Arizona 

Yes, we’d like that. How do we go about doing it? 

That, apologetically, is that for this month. Next issue we 
hope to have maybe three pages of letters instead of this in- 
adequate one — planned for it this issue, in fact, but the type 
wouldn’t stretch. See you then I
