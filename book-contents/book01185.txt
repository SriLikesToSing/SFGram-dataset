Joe Haldeman creates the 
savage, bitter universe of the 
grunts of the future in THE 
FOREVER WAR - a story of 
combat beyond the solar system 
in a war without mercy, purpose 
or end. The young draftees, 
male and female, conditioned to 
massacre an enemy no one has 
bothered to try to understand, return to 
an earth as alien as the worlds on which they 
fight — an earth where their only alternative is 
to reenlist. 



“This war is the opposite of the one Heinlein 
glorified in Starship Troopers — bloody, cruel 
and meaningless. ... A splendid, thoughtful 
adventure.”

ROGER ZELAZNY 

SOME SCIENCE FICTION 
PARAMETERS: A BIASED VIEW 



¥ 



1 remember the seats and the 
view: hard wood, with corrugated 
metal high above, television 
monitors below on the ground, 
ready, a big clock scoring the sec- 
onds; in the distance, a narrow inlet 
of calm water reflecting a grayness 
of cloud between us and the vehi- 
cle. A couple places over to my 
left, Harry Stubbs was taking a pic- 
ture. To my right, a young Korean 
girl was doing the same thing with- 
out a camera. She was painting a 
watercolor of the scene. In the tier 
immediately before and below me, 
with occasional gestures, a Euro- 
pean journalist was speaking rapid 
Serbo-Croat into a plug-in tele- 
phone. On the ground, to the far 
left, the brightly garbed center of a 
small system of listeners, Sybil 
Leek was explaining that the 
weather would clear up shortly and 
there would be no further problems. 
When the weather did clear and the 
clock scythed down the final sec- 
onds, we saw the ignition before we 
heard it and the water was agitated 
by a shock wave racing across in 
our direction. Apollo 14 was al- 
ready lifting when the sound struck, 
and the volume kept increasing until 
the metal roof vibrated. A cheer 



went up around us and I kept 
watching until the roof’s edge 
blocked my view. Then I followed 
the flight’s progress on the monitor. 
I remember thinking, “I’ve waited 
for this.” 

I was not really thinking about 
science fiction at that moment. I 
was thinking only of the event it- 
self. Yet I would not have been 
waiting at that spot at that time had 
it not been for my connection with 
science fiction. It was in the calmer 
hours of evenings after that I did 
give some thought to the manner in 
which science fiction has touched 
me over the years, trying to fit a 
few of the things that seemed part 
of it into some larger perspective. 

I was raised and educated in 
times and places where science fic- 
tion was not considered a branch of 
belles lettres. As I was exposed to 
critical thought in other areas of lit- 
erature it did seem to me that science 
fiction was being shortchanged, 
in that when it was mentioned 
at all it was generally with refer- 
ence to the worst rather than the 
best that it had to offer. Unfair, 
yet this was the way of the world. 

Recently, however, the situa- 



6 




tion changed and science fiction has 
been a subject of increasing critical 
and academic scrutiny. The reason, 
I feel, is partly that a sufficiently 
large body of good science fiction 
has now been amassed to warrant 
such consideration, but mainly be- 
cause those who felt as I did in earl- 
ier times and then proceeded to fol- 
low academic careers have taken 
approximately this long to achieve 
positions where they could do some- 
thing about it. Therefore, I have 
been pleased whenever I have been 
asked to address a university audi- 
ence on this subject, not simply be- 
cause it seems to represent some 
vindication of my tastes, but be- 
cause I feel comfortable with those 
who worked to effect the change in 
attitude. 

Yet, this generated a new prob- 
lem for me. Every time that I spoke 
I had to have something to say. It 
required that I examine my own un- 
questioned responses to science fic- 
tion and consider some of the forces 
which have shaped and are shaping 
it. When I was asked to do this 
piece, I decided to draw together 
the results of these efforts and dis- 
play whatever chimera might 
emerge, both because I am curious 
to see it myself and because I wish 
to get in a few words before the 
amount of science fiction criticism 
surpasses the amount of science fic- 
tion and I am less likely to be 
noticed. 

The Apollo-sized hole filled in 
my psyche that day in Florida had 



been excavated more than twenty 
years earlier, when I had begun 
reading tales of space travel. This 
was a part of it. Certainly not all, 
but emotion is as much a part of 
meaning as thought, and since most 
longtime fans began reading the lit- 
erature at an early age the feelings 
it aroused were generally the main 
attraction. What do they really 
amount to? Pure escapism? A love 
of cosmic-scale spectacle? The rein- 
forcement of juvenile fantasies at 
about the time they would normally 
begin to fade? All of these? Some? 
None? Or something else? 

The term “sense of wonder” gets 
considerable mileage in discussions 
such as this, and I have sought this 
feeling elsewhere in literature in 
hope of gaining a fuller understand- 
ing of its mechanism. I have ex- 
perienced it in two other places: the 
writings of Saint-Exupery on the 
early days of air travel and the writ- 
ings of Jacques Cousteau on the be- 
ginnings of underwater exploration 
with scuba gear. The common ele- 
ment, as I saw it, was that both 
stories share with science fiction a 
theme involving the penetration of 
previously unknown worlds by 
means of devices designed and as- 
sembled by man, thereby extending 
his senses into new realms. 

Turning backward, I felt obliged 
to classify the myths, legends, 
scriptural writings and bits of 
folklore which have always held a 
high place in my imaginary wander- 
ings as contributory but different.

There have always been story-tellers 
of a speculative case of mind who 
have taken some delight in playing 
about the peripheries of the known, 
guessing at the dimensions of the 
unknown. It might be argued that 
this is a necessary ingredient for, by 
Aristotle’s definition, the highest 
form of literature — the epic — 
dealing as it does with the entire 
ethos of a people, up to and includ- 
ing that open end of the human 
condition, death itself, in a fashion 
transcending even the grand visions 
of tragedy and comedy. True epics 
of course are few and historically 
well-spaced, but that slightly more 
mundane ingredient, the speculative 
impulse, be it of Classic, Christian 
or Renaissance shading, which or- 
namented Western literature with 
romances, fables, exotic voyages 
and utopias, seemed to me basically 
the same turn of fancy exercised to- 
day in science fiction, working then 
with the only objects available to it. 
It took the Enlightenment, it took 
science, it took the industrial re- 
volution to provide new sources of 
ideas which, pushed, poked, in- 
verted and rotated through higher 
spaces, resulted in science fiction. 
When the biggest, most interesting 
ideas began emerging from science, 
rather than theology or the explora- 
tion of new lands, hindsight makes 
it seem logical that something like 
science fiction had to be delivered. 

Of course, the realistic novel was 
also slapped on the bottom and ut- 
tered its first cries at that time, an 



event which requires a glance at the 
differences in endowment. Basical- 
ly, as I have said here and there be- 
fore, the modern, realistic novel has 
discarded what Northrop Frye has 
classified as the higher modes of 
character. It is a democratic place, 
without room for heroes, rash 
kings, demigods and deities. Sci- 
ence fiction, on the other hand, re- 
tained and elaborated these modes, 
including mutants, aliens, robots, 
androids and sentient computers. 
There is a basic difference in 
character and characterization as 
well as the source and flow of 
ideas. 

And what of those ideas? It has 
been persuasively argued that Fran- 
kenstein was the first science fiction 
novel. To simplify, as one must in 
these discussions, there seems to 
be, within the body of science fic- 
tion, a kind of Frankenstein vs. 
Pygmalion tension, an internal and 
perhaps eternal debate as to whether 
man’s creations will destroy him or 
live happily with him forever after. 
In the days when I began reading 
science fiction I would say that, 
statistically, Pygmalion had the up- 
per hand. The “sense of wonder” 
as I knew it was in most stories un- 
alloyed with those fears and con- 
cerns which the unforeseen side- 
effects of some technological usages 
have brought about in recent years. 
The lady delivered purer visions in- 
volving the entry into new worlds 
and the extension of our senses. 
Now the cautionary quality is re- 



8 



GALAXY 




turned, and the shadow of Franken- 
stein’s monster falls across much of 
our work. Yet, because this is a 
part of the force which generates 
the visions, it cannot be destructive 
to the area itself. Speaking not as a 
prognosticator or moralist, but only 
as a writer, my personal feelings are 
that a cycle such as this is good for 
the field, that if nothing else it 
promotes a re-examination of our at- 
titudes, whatever they may be, to- 
ward the basic man-machine-society 
relationships. End of disgression. 

Science fiction’s special quality, 
the means by which it achieves its 
best effects, is of course the imagin- 
ation, pitched here several octaves 
above the notes it sounds elsewhere 
in literature. To score it properly is 
one of the major difficulties faced 
in the writing of science fiction; 
namely, in addition to the standard 
requirements encountered in com- 
posing a mundane story, one has 
the added task of explaining the 
extra plot premises and peculiarities 
of setting — without visibly slowing 
the action or lessening the tensions 
which must be built as the narrative 
progresses. This has led, over the 
years, to the development of cliches 
(I would like to have said “conven- 
tions”, but the word has a way of 
not working properly when applied 
to science fiction), cliches involving 
the acceptance at mere mention of 
such phenomena as faster-than-light 
travel, telepathy, matter transmis- 
sion, immortality drugs and instant 
language translation devices, to 



name a few. Their use represents an 
artificiality of an order not found 
elsewhere in contemporary 
letters — excepting individiual poets 
with private mythologies, which is 
not really the same thing as an en- 
tire field holding stock in common. 
Yet the artificiality does not really 
detract and the illusion does work 
because of the compensatory effect 
of a higher level of curiosity 
aroused as to the nature of the 
beast. Literally anything may be the 
subject of a science fiction story. In 
accepting the cliches of science fic- 
tion, one is also abandoning the 
everyday assumptions which hold for 
the run of mundane fiction. This in 
some ways requires a higher degree 
of sophistication, but the rewards 
are commensurate. 

These are some of the more ob- 
vious things which set science fic- 
tion apart from the modem realistic 
story. But, if there must be some 
grand, overall scheme to literature, 
where does science fiction fit? I am 
leery of that great classifier Aristo- 
tle in one respect which bears on 
the issue. The Hellenic world did 
not view the passage of time as we 
do. History was considered in an 
episodic sense, as the struggles of 
an unchanging mankind against a 
relentless and unchanging fate. The 
slow process of organic evolution 
had not yet been detected, and the 
grandest model for a world-view 
was the seeming changeless pattem- 
ings of the stars. It took the same

processes which set the stage for 
science fiction — eighteenth-century 
rationalism and nineteenth-century 
science — to provide for the first 
time in history of the world a sense 
of historical direction, of time as a 
developmental, non-repetitive se- 
quence. 

This particular world-view be- 
came a part of science fiction in a 
far more explicit fashion than in any 
other body of storytelling, as it pro- 
vided the basis for its favorite exer- 
cise: extrapolation. I feel that be- 
cause of this science fiction is the 
.form of literature least affected by 
Aristotle’s dicta with respect to the 
nature of the human condition, 
which he saw as immutable, and the 
nature of man’s fate, which he saw 
as inevitable. 

Yet science fiction is concerned 
with the human condition and with 
man’s fate. It is the speculative na- 
ture of its concern which required 
the abandonment of the Aristotelian 
strictures involving the given im- 
ponderables. Its methods have in- 
cluded a retention of the higher 
modes of character, an historical, 
developmental time-sense, assimila- 
tion of the tensions of a technologi- 
cal society and the production of a 
“sense of wonder” by exercises of 
imagination extending awareness 
into new realms — a sensation capa- 
ble, at its best, of matching the 
power of that experience of recogni- 
tion which Aristotle held to be the 
strongest effect of tragedy. It might 
even be argued that the sense of 

10 



wonder represents a different order 
of recognition, but I see no reason 
to ply the possible metaphysics of it 
at this point. 

Since respectability tends to pro- 
mote a concern for one’s ancestors, 
we are fortunate to be in on things 
at the beginning today when one 
can still aim high and compose 
one’s features into an attitude of 
certainty while hoping for agree- 
ment. It occurs to me then that 
there is a relationship between the 
entire body of science fiction and 
that high literary form, the epic. 
Traditionally, the epic was regarded 
as representing the spirit of an en- 
tire people — the Iliad, the 
Mahabharta, the Aeneid showing us 
the values, the concerns, the 
hoped-for destinies of the Greeks, 
the ancient Indians, the Romans. 
Science fiction is less provincial, 
for it really deals with humanity as 
such. I am not so temerarious as to 
suggest that any single work of sci- 
ence fiction has ever come near the 
epic level (though Olaf Stapleton 
probably came closest), but wish 
rather to observe that the impulse 
behind it is akin to that of the epic 
chronicler, and is reflected in the 
desire to deal with the future of 
humanity, describing in every way 
possible the spirit and destiny not of 
a single nation but of Man. 

High literature, unfortunately, re- 
quires more than good intentions, 
and so I feel obliged to repeat my 
caveat to prevent my being misun- 
derstood any more than is usually 

GALAXY 




the case. In speaking of the epic, I 
am attempting to indicate a similar- 
ity in spirit and substance between 
science fiction as a whole and some 
of the classical features of the epic 
form. I am not maintaining that it 
has been achieved in any particular 
case or even by the entire field view- 
ed as a single entity. It may have. 
It may not. I stand too near to see 
that clearly. I suggest only that sci- 
ence fiction is animated in a similar 
fashion, occasionally possesses 
something like a Homeric afflatus 
and that its general aims are of the 
same order, producing a greater 
kinship here than with the realistic 
novel beside which it was bom and 
bred. The source of this particular 
vitality may well be the fact that, 
like its subject, it keeps growing but 
remains unfinished. 

These were some of the thoughts 
which occurred to me when I was 
asked to do a piece on the parame- 
ters of science fiction. I reviewed 
my association with the area, first 
as a reader and fan, recalling that 
science fiction is unique in possess- 
ing a fandom and a convention sys- 
tem which make for personal con- 
tacts between authors and readers, a 
situation which may be of peculiar 
significance. When an author is in a 
position to meet and speak with 
large numbers of his readers he 
cannot help, at least for a little 
while, feeling somewhat as the old- 
time story-tellers must have felt in 
facing the questions and the com- 



ments of a live audience. The 
psychological process involved in 
this should be given some consider- 
ation as an influence on the field. I 
thought of my connection as a wri- 
ter, self-knowledge suggesting that 
the remedy for the biggest headache 
in its composition — furnishing the 
extra explanations as painlessly as 
possible — may be the mechanism by 
which the imagination is roused to 
climb those several extra steps to 
the point where the unusual be- 
comes plausible — and thus the 
freshness; thus, when it is well 
done, the wonder. And then I 
thought of all the extracurricular 
things which many of us either care 
about because we are science fiction 
writers or are science fiction writers 
because we care about. 

Which takes me back to the 
stands at the Cape, the vibrations, 
the shouting, to my “I’ve waited 
for this.’’ My enthusiasm at the 
successful launching of a manned 
flight to the moon perhaps tells you 
more about me than it does about 
science fiction and its parameters, 
for space flight is only a part of the 
story we have been engaged in 
telling — a colorful part, to be 
sure — of the tale of man and his 
growing awareness. For on reflec- 
tion, having watched the fire, felt 
the force and seen the vessel lifted 
above the Earth, it seemed a 
triumph for Pygmalion; and that, I 
realized, had more to do with my 
view that day than the fire, the 
force or the vessel. jf

Mishkin and the robot came to 
a tree. At the end of its branches 
there were blue eyes with thick 
eyebrows. All of the eyes swivelled 
to stare at Mishkin. 

“I thought you would come by 
this way,” the tree said, speaking 
from a speaker in its trunk. “I hope 
that you will not deny that you are 
Thomas Mishkin?” 

“That’s who I am.” Mishkin 
said. “Who are you?” 

“I am a bill collector disguised 
as a tree,” said the bill collector 
disguised as a tree. 

“For Chrissakes,” Mishkin said. 
“Did you follow me all the way to 
Harmonia?” 

“Indeed I did. It’s rather a curi- 
ous story. Mr. Oppenheimer, head 
of the Ne Plus Ultra Collection 
Agency for which I work, got an 
inspiration while stoned on acid at 
his local Tai Chi Chuan class. It 
suddenly occurred to Oppenheimer 
that the essence of life lies in com- 
pletions, and a man can only judge 
his life in reference to the 
thoroughness with which he has 
played his life-role. Hitherto, Op- 
penheimer had been an easy-going 
fellow who followed the usual prac- 
tice of collecting the easily collect- 
ible debts and making a few omi- 
nous noises on the difficult ones, but 
ultimately saying to hell with them. 
Then Oppenheimer achieved his 
satori. 

To hell with mediocrity, he de- 
cided, if I’m head of a bill- 



collecting agency, then I’m going to 
make an ethic and a goal out of bill 
collecting. The world may very well 
never understand me; but perhaps 
future generations will be able to 
judge the terrible purity of my mo- 
tives.’ 

“And so Oppenheimer embarked 
upon the poignant and quixotic 
course that will probably bankrupt 
him within the year. He called all 
of us collectors into the Ready 
Room. ‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘this 
time we’re going to get it all to- 
gether. 

To hell with half-measures! 
Our goal now is 100 percent enforce- 
ability, and let the paranoia fall 
where it may. Go after those debts, 
be they one dollar or a million. Go 
to San Sebastian or Samoa or Sam- 
bal V, if need be, and don’t worry 
about the costs. We’re following a 
principle now, and principles are 
always impractical. Boys, we’re 
overthrowing the reality principle. 
So get out there and collect all of 
those debits and groove on comple- 
tions.’ ” 

(“His speech is definitely late 
1960s,” said the robot. “Whereas 
this is the year 2138 or therabouts. 
Somebody is conning somebody.” 

“Fuck off,” snarled the author.) 

“That was the call to arms,” the 
bill collector disguised as a tree 
said. 

“And that is why I am in Har- 
monia, Mr. Mishkin. I have come 
here as the result of one man’s vis- 



13 




ion, to collect your debts regardless 
of time, trouble and expense.” 

“I still can’t believe this,” Mish- 
kin said. 

“And yet, there it is. I have a 
consolidation statement here for ev- 
erything, Mr. Mishkin. Would you 
care to pay without fuss, or do you 
want me to get nasty?” 

“What debits are you talking 
about?” Mishkin asked. 

“To begin with, there is the mat- 
ter of your back taxes, Federal, 
State and City. Didn’t quite get 
around to paying them last year, did 
you, Mr. Mishkin?” 

“It was a tough year.” 

“You owe eight thousand seven 
hundred and fifty-three dollars and 
fifty-one cents to your Uncle Sam- 
my. Then there is the matter of 
child support. Sorta passed up on 
that for a year or so, didn’t you, 
Mishkin? Well, it’s a neat four- 
figure bundle that you owe to poor 
abandoned Marcia and little Zelda. 
Marcia has a new boyfriend, by the 
way, and little Zelda just flunked 
out of the Little Red Schoolhouse. 
Marcia asked me to tell you that she 
is well, having the best time of her 
life, and wants every cent you owe 
her, right now, or she’ll have you 
into The Tombs so fast it’ll make 
your teeth spin. She adds that, 
through psychoanalysis, she finally 
has the ego- strength to tell you that 
you were always a lousy lay and 
that everybody breaks up when she 
relates how diffidently you tried to 
pursue perversions.” 



“That sounds like Marcia,” 
Mishkin said. 

“Next, you owe Marty Bargen- 
field a thousand dollars. He’s your 
best friend, in case you don’t re- 
member. Or he was. I mean, he 
still feels the same, but you’ve un- 
accountably cooled off. One might 
even say that you are avoiding him. 
Yet his only crime was to loan you 
money in a moment of need, when 
you were breaking up with Marcia 
and had to buy an abortion for 
Monique.” 

“How is Monique?” Mishkin 
asked. 

“She’s doing very nicely without 
you. She is back in Paris, working 
as a sales girl in Galleries Lafa- 
yette. She still treasures the eighty - 
cent string of wooden beads which 
was your only present to her during 
a tumultuous four month romance 
which you have described as ‘the 
most moving of my life.’ ” 

“I was broke,” Mishkin said. 
“And anyhow, she always said she 
hated gifts.” 

“But you knew better, hey, Mish- 
kie? Never mind, I am not stand- 
ing in judgement over you. The fact 
that your conduct, judged by any 
system of ethics you care to name, 
makes me want to puke, is entirely 
a personal matter with me and need 
not concern you at all. Now we 
come to the Bauhous Drugstore at 
31 Barrow Street, run by fat 
friendly Charlie Ducks, who sold 
you dexamyl spansules, dexadrine 
tablets, librium, carbitol, nembutal,

GALAXY 




seconal, doriden, and so on, in as- 
tonishing quantities during your 
drug years, all of them on the basis 
of one non-refillable prescription for 
phenobarbital; who continued to do 
so until two years ago, when the 
heat got too hot and he want back 
to selling excedrin and lipsticks, 
and whom you ripped off for one 
hundred and eight- six dollars.” 

‘‘He cleaned up on me,” Mish- 
kin said. ‘‘He charged me double 
for everything.” 

‘‘You always knew that. Did you 
ever complain about it?” 

“Anyhow, I’m going to pay him 
as soon as I get a hold of some 
money.” 

“But there’s never enough money 
for last year’s drugs, eh, Mish? 
We’ve all been down that road, 
baby; but it is loathsome, isn’t it?” 
“I can explain everything,” Mish- 
kin said. “I have a statement 
which I would like to read into the 
record. The facts are capable of var- 
ious interpretations. I only need a 
moment to pull myself together.” 
The robot extruded an axe from 
his left hand. He stepped forward 
and briskly chopped down the bill- 
collector, who perished miserably. 

“But I was just about to ex- 
plain,” Mishkin said. 

“Never explain anything,” the 
robot told him. “Avoid bummers. 
Don’t go on other people’s trips.” 
“What is my trip?’’ Mishkin 
asked. 

“That would be telling,” said the 
robot. ★ 



SYNCOPE AND FUGUE 






A ROBERT SHECKLEY SELECTION 



DARE NOT 
MEET IN DREAMS 



William Chait 

Illegal, immoral, and fattening- 
only Barttleby was all three! 






1 . THE ARTIFICIAL SKY 

Stately, plump Bartleby Scrip 
comes from the stairhead, mortally, 
morbidly, bored and depressed. He 
mounts the parapet. Below him de- 
scend fourteen monotonous levels; 
in great cellular walls they curve 
away crescentlike to right and left, 
meeting again distantly. The Spa is 
like a hive, thinks Scrip, only each 
of us isolated in his or her own 
cubicle (actually not a cube at all 
but a rhomboidal octahedron) with 
nothing so productive as bees to be 
busy at. After a last weary look 
around he gives a little launching 
kick and jumps from the parapet. 

Rich, thick air gathers under the 
clear flexicon wings webbed be- 
tween his body and outstretched 
limbs. With a few good strokes he 
gains against the local down-air and 
levels off into a planing glide, slip- 
stream whipping his hair and beat- 
ing against his Ace Flyer goggles. 
Naked, or nearly so, alone, aloof, 
aloft, Scrip soars listlessly, like 
Daedalus forsaken after Icarus fell. 

Scrip likes flying best of anything 
about the Spa, about the moon it- 
self. It keeps the boredom at bay: 
not just the relative weightlessness, 
as with skindiving, but the effortless 
speed, the pure ‘personal freedom 
which he gratefully assumes along 
with the artificial wings. Of course, 
only the moon’s fractional gravity 
allows him to fly, to fulfill that ar- 
chetypal dream, but he would have 
dreamed it regardless. Although 



Freud saw in dreams of flying a 
token of sexual repression, a wish- 
ful flight of the libido. Dirty old 
killjoy. 

Gliding idly, he regards the sky, 
which is now only a few meters 
above him. The sky is a seamless 
expanse of translucent dome, a 
kilometer and a half across, capping 
the high-rimmed crater like a 
cloche-lidded dish, or a hermetic 
bell-jar valving out raw ultra-violet 
while admitting beneficent Sol. 
Scrip has taken his suntan pill; sun- 
shine is another luxury service of 
the Spa. It gleams an unlikely ceru- 
lean through the vast palpable bowl 
of the strained-glass heavens. 

If the odd meteorite, Scrip con- 
siders, should puncture the dome 
just now, might that not divert the 
tedium, te deum, and scuttle this 
ship of comatose fools? Yet that 
continuous flickering on the con- 
cave underside indicates that small 
meteorites are even now being in- 
cinerated by the charged ion-field of 
the outer skin, and big ones will be 
handily shot down by the war- 
surplus antimissile lasers. Just as 
well. Scrip banks away from its ir- 
idescent surface with a neat ad- 
justment to the aspect ratio of his 
lefthand wing. 

Turning and turning in the widen- 
ing gyres. Arch hunter of the upper 
airs, proud lord of the winds, lone 
eagle, spreadeagled, hawkeyed 
eagle scanning for prey, he surveys 
the lunar pastorale below. Within 
the circumference of the faceted 



17 




cliff-dwelling: the crater floor all 
flat and green. A volley-ball game 
in progress on the two-hundred- 
meter court; volley-ball is invariably 
played in the nude. The gardens and 
orchards, where grows celery (five 
calories per bunch), tomatoes (six 
apiece), lettuce (four calories a 
head), as well as orange, peach, 
and other fruit trees. In another 
quadrant of the circle a chubby pla- 
toon stands ranked on the grassy 
exercise field. A tall, mannish fig- 
ure addresses them and her voice 
carries tinnily up to Scrip: 

“. your Fitness Directress, 
Geneva Woodruff, rhymes with 
foodstuff. Heh heh. Exercise is the 
very raisin d’etre of the Spa. It is 
why you have come to the moon. 
Because it is easier to move when 
you weigh only a sixth of what you 
do on Earth, you can make some of 
that loss permanent. If you exercise, 
and follow your diets. They, as you 
know, need not be enforced; the 
nearest illicit hot-fudge sundae is 
two hundred and forty thousand 
miles aAyay. Heh heh. Remember 
that and abandon all hope of cheat- 
ing with even a sliver of 
cheesecake. There isn’t any 
cheesecake here to tempt you. But 
you have not come here to starve it 
off. Rather, to exercise it away. 
Right. Jumping jacks. Not too high, 
mind. After me. One, two, three 
and feet together again. One, 
two. .” 

For the Spa is a fat farm on the 
moon, an extra-terrestrial reducing 

18 



resort. (Ironic, perhaps, but while 
there are lots of orbital factories, 
broadcasting facilities and such, so 
far the moon has turned out to be 
humanly useful only for this — but 
that’s Free Enterprise for you.) The 
prestige of being able to afford a 
trip to the moon and a stay at 
Selena Spa doubtless compensates 
for the stigma of needing to slim. 
No lumpenproletariat these. 

Conceivably, too, they throw 
money away here to demonstrate a 
careless contempt for that which 
rules their earthside lives, as at a 
gambling casino. Scrip intends to 
oblige them by relieving some too, 
in his own small way. 

He wheels into an ascending 
helix, catching the steady thermal 
on the central, vertical axis of the 
dome. There are other flyers about, 
plump angels in their transparent 
sweatsuits looking like so many 
cellophane-wrapped bumble-bees. 
For those too heavy or weak to fly 
on their own even here, pedicopters 
have been provided. However much 
overweight, the pink-skinned 
blimplike forms sweep the sky with 
all the easy grace of seagulls, an 
elephantine ballet. 

Scrip, also, is grossly propor- 
tioned, but fat is only his disguise. 
An ectomorph at core, he has been 
blown up with hormones and 
metabolic steroids. This mufti of 
blubber can easily be shed, Georgie 
had assured him, after the caper. 
Reversible treatments, Georgie had 
said. They had better be; Scrip 

GALAXY 




shudders to think what he’ll do to 
Georgie if they’re not. At worst 
he’d have to reduce in earnest. 
Which is worse enough, he thinks. 
He has been ravenous since he ar- 
rived, fantasizing — like de Sade in 
the Bastille — orgies of puff pastry 
and spaghetti and asparagus in Hol- 
landaise sauce. 

Bartleby Scrip is obviously as 
phoney as his fat, but he welcomes 
the actor’s opportunity to put on a 
new identity. An assumed name — 
like all names. Scrip is arbitrarily 
posing as an East Chicago playboy 
but could as well be Frank 
Zei rocks, the photocopy magnate, 
or Sir Adrian Cleverly, the crack 
lawyer, or Count Ehrfitt of Lower 
Schlessweg. Goot mornink, mine 
hair. Mac Yavelly, the secret politi- 
cian. 

Possibly he doesn’t mind not be- 
ing himself because he doesn’t 
much admire what he’s doing on 
the moon. Alternatively if he weren’t 
deceiving, the self-contempt might 
not arise, or maybe he wouldn’t 
like himself in any case; life is like 
that. 

Scrip alights on a perch for tired 
flyers, carefully folding his wings. 
It is crowded as a locker-room with 
democratizing near-nudity, and 
noisy with chatter: English spoken 
here, mostly, or at least that 
ubiquitous Midatlantic accent for 
whose patronage Selena Spa caters, 
although Scrip notes a massive 
South American — a Largintinian, no 
doubt — and a sleek-skinned Orien- 



tal; he wonders whether they, too, 
darken under the sun. (At other 
such resorts, Moonranch for exam- 
ple, the clientele might be predom- 
inantly American, or European at 
St. Genet’s where the female staff 
wear elaborate pointy nuns’ coifs 
and little else, and terms like Refec- 
tory and Dormitory give a mock- 
monastic tone to the ascetic regimen 
of self-denial.) 

There is also a lush, cherubic girl 
alight on his perch, one of the 
dumpling-maids at this fat-rendering 
factory to be rolled in one end and 
extruded out the other as a sylph. 
Pity, thinks Scrip, she’s lovely as 
she is, especially as lunar gravity 
eliminates sag. She is trying to at- 
tract his attention by winding her 
chewing gum round a long lascivi- 
ous tongue. 

She tempts him, Scrip himself a 
tempter, but he resists obscurely. 
He fears an intimacy with some but- 
terball betrayer, exclaiming between 
caresses that his fat doesn’t feel 
right somehow. Ah, then the un- 
masking, the grim-jawed heavies, 
the long knives. For surely the 
management would take indignant 
exception to his activities, and take 
the law into its own vengeful hands. 
Like many wrongdoers, Scrip has 
avoided ascertaining the exact con- 
sequences of his crime, if crime it 
be. Once he’d thought, the beauty 
part of the present caper is its 
quasi-legality. Immoral yes, but 
how illegal? That was before he’d 
grown so paranoid about the 



EYES I DARE NOT MEET IN DREAMS 



19 




vacant-eyed musclemen who waited 
silently on table. 

He imagines them coming to get 
him, raiding his cubicle, the in- 
criminating evidence found. Perhaps 
a repentant or dissatisfied customer 
of his will spill the beans and turn 
him in. Scrip, on the moon under 
false name and pretenses; who’d 
know if he didn’t come back? 
Who’d care — Georgie? Scrip taken 
for a ride outside the dome. And 
left in the long cold lunar night all 
alone: so long, sucker. 

“Gotcha!” Scrip jumps at the 
man’s touch. “Been looking all over 
for you, Balaban. We met at what 
passes for dinner.” 

It is Lester Blumquist, a 
sausage-shaped executive, the sort 
who hums Muzak. His complexion 
has over-ripened in the unaccus- 
tomed sun, unwholesomely, like a 
tomato pizza. He is the first poten- 
tial mark Scrip has approached. 
“Blumstead. What’s cooking?” 
“Hunger gnaws at my vitals, as 
Sylvester the Cat used to say. Bala- 
ban, I can’t stand it,” he whines. 
“It’s like being in prison.” 

Scrip, who has on occasion been 
in prison himself, grins with am- 
biguous sympathy. “What’s your 
beef, Bumquist? You can always 
leave.” 

“No space flights during lunar- 
day sessions. .” 

“Nuts, that’s right. A fine kettle 
of fish. Well, don’t be chicken, 
Babquist, stick it out.” 

“I’ll never last, Barnaby. It’s 

20 



driving me bananas. My wife, 
Bertha, is equally obsessed. We 
dare not sleep; maddening dreams 
of technicolor food, the haunting 
aroma of frying potatoes. .” He 
confides his regret at bringing the 
little woman (two hundred earth- 
pounds?) but Scrip thinks, Right. 
That’s why he chose a couple; they 
can share and reinforce each other’s 
lack of fortitude, and Scrip can 
double the take. “Please, Barnsta- 
ble. What — you’ve got — can make 
it bearable. You hinted as much at 
dinner. ’ ’ 

“Your suffering moves me,” fibs 
Scrip. “My suppliers however will 
cost you.” 

“I’m no pauper.” 

“Five hundred New Bucks, then. 
Apiece. Cash, of course.” 

“Is it the real stuff? No synthe- 
tics? I’ve been burned before.” 
Lester is a desperate man, thinks 
Scrip, he does not stoop to haggle. 
“The real stuff, Mr. Bumstead. It’s 
a deal.” 

2. THE CONTACT 

Birdman scrip, free in the pale 
antiseptic air, gauges his descent. 
Flying is not so easy as it looks; 
real eagles, Scrip has read, acquire 
a kind of sixth sense for anticipating 
pressure-changes and reacting to 
them, yet they fly by experienced 
skill, not instinct. A goodly propor- 
tion of eaglets never manage to 
learn. Evolution, to be sure, never 
meant men to fly, Leonardo not- 

GALAXY 




withstanding. Heavy, marrow-filled 
bones, no keel-like sternum to an- 
chor the mighty chest muscles. 
Most obviously, no tail for steering 
and braking, no feathers for delicate 
trim. Scrip has become proficient, 
though, and recently executed a 
twelve-point barrel roll with a bit of 
luck. Unfortunately nobody had 
been watching at the time. 

Careful now, kill a bit more 
airspeed, don’t overshoot. While the 
air currents in the dome tend to be 
very regular and thus reliable — 
cylindrical updraft in the middle, a 
torus arching down to the peri- 
meter — even the simplest landing 
requires exquisite timing. Scrip 
matches his speed with the wind, 
then increases resistance by spread- 
ing his wings to parachute in. 
Abruptly he stalls and drops clum- 
sily onto the Beanery court, nar- 
rowly missing a table. “Oh, hi 
there.’’ 

“You all right, then? Nearly 
came down in my lap.” 

That lap would be ample enough. 
Major A.P. ‘Tank’ Peasblossom, 
V.C., O.B.E.(se), retired — as are 
all majors, generals, sergeants, 
major-generals, sergeants-major, 
fried-chicken-colonels and buck- 
naked privates, under the Pax 
Luna — could anytime be found here 
on the Beanery court. Breaking all 
earthly scales at twenty -three stone, 
he never flies, even by pedicopter, 
always and only sits strategically 
tabled with a view of the playing 
fields of eaten, where the war 



waged against fat would be won. 
But not by him. His ancient field- 
glasses, once the formidable eyes of 
the last Armoured Tactical Assault 
shock Commando Force, now focus 
only on the double-breasted, deep- 
chested, full-bodied female patrons 
of Selena Spa. Since most of the 
latter go starkers, it is a tit-man’s 
paradise. 

“Nipples, actually,” he explains 
to Scrip. “A specialized subset of 
breastworks, my retirement hobby. 
The bigger the better, I’d always 
thought, yet a tit without a nipple is 
only an udder.” 

“An udder what?” quips Scrip. 

The major chuckles Falstaffian. 
“An utter boob, a pun my word. 
You’re witty with the titties, my 
boy.” 

“Thanks, I like to keep a breast 
of developments.” 

“Used to be in tanks myself, but 
I’ve traded tanks for the mam- 
maries. Nipples, as I say, are as 
various as faces and equally reveal 
much inner character. I’ve become 
a kind of pectoral physiognomist, as 
it were. Take that waitress for in- 
stance, the one with the heliotrope 
hair.” 

“Gladly, sir.” Scrip scrutinizes 
the subject indicated. Waitresses’ 
uniforms consist only of aprons, 
with emblazoned pockets (Hi! I’m 
your Slendrette MARLA!), while 
male staff wear starched tuxedo 
shirtfronts, bow ties, and black 
formal jockstraps. Since Spa 
employees had evidently been hired 



EYES I DARE NOT MEET IN DREAMS 



21 




largely for their near-ideal 
physiques (Scrip half-suspects them 
of being lifelike robots, too perfect 
and expressionless), this bodily ex- 
posure must be intended to 
psychologically encourage patrons 
by example towards that goal. 
Marla is, in short, pulchritudinous. 

“Now, your smallish, darkish, 
high-definition nipple type usually 
denotes a diffident introvert,” pero- 
rates Major Peasblossom, ret., “as 
distinguished from, say, your 
good-natured, self-assertive, dilated 
areola. In Marla’s nipples I none- 
theless read a laconic articulation of 
the corona masking some latent in- 
tensity. They’re asymmetrical, you 
see, and almost always erect. And 
yesterday I could have sworn the 
right one winked at me.” 

“Good Gravy!” 

“It did. As if to say, “I know 
your game, old man, but I don’t 
mind.” Endearing gesture, don’t 
you think? As with bird- watching, 
patient observation of the rosy tit 
paid off. You must borrow my 
field-glasses sometime. A most re- 
warding study.” 

“May one not assume then, sir, 
that you haven’t come to the Spa to 
reduce?” ventures Scrip, thinking, 
All the better for me. 

“My dear boy, I’m too thin now. 
I was no beanpole in my youth, into 
my tank with a shoehorn. .” 

“But, Major, aside from the 
aesthetic compensations of your 
unique avocation, the diet here must 
be hard to bear?” 



The portly old soldier sighs. 
“Orders are orders, even doctors’ 
orders. I come here often, a not un- 
pleasant duty. The light lunar grav- 
ity helps support my overload, like 
the brontosaurus in his bog. I have 
always loved to eat, t’eat, yet one 
must make sacrifices for one’s art, 
if not one’s health. Sometimes, 
though, when zeroing-in on a pair 
of pendulous bosoms, such as once 
put lead in my pencil, I can think 
only of calorific fruits swaying ripe 
on the vine: sweet cantalopes, gold- 
en honey dews, watermelons. 

He salivates copiously, without 
shame. 

Now for the clincher. “I’d like to 
help you, Major,” says Scrip, but 
for some reason he quotes him a 
much lower price than for the 
Blumquists. That is why Scrip is 
not a very good con man. 

Later, reflecting on it: Take 
Georgie for instance, superlative, an 
artist consummate. Georgie suits the 
role much better; moreover he is 
genuinely stout. His salesmanship, 
thinks Scrip, is infinitely more 
sophisticated than my own ingenu- 
ous approach. Hey, meester. Geor- 
gie could be President he’s such a 
fraud; he can lie to a polygraph. 
Georgie however, with a record 
longer than Pinocchio’s nose, could 
never have gotten past the outbound 
Customs gate unless the cops had 
their heads up their asses. Which 
oftimes they do: still too great a 
risk. For Georgie, that is. 

Some uneasy awareness causes 



22 



GALAXY 




Scrip to glance up. The Major has 
waddled off somewhere. Marla, the 
waitress with the heliotrope hair 
and, purportedly, the educated nip- 
ples, stands at his table. She sets a 
cloche-lidded dish before him. 

“Sorry, but I didn’t order — ” 

“T.S., B.S.,” she prompts, 
transfixing him with a gently com- 
manding gaze. He uncovers the 
dish. 

It contains a single, perfect 
peach. 

Scrip stares blankly at the peach, 
then the girl. 

“Your cue,’’ she says, uncer- 
tainly now. “T.S.?” 

Tough shit, bull shit, T.S. Eliot? 
A rush of confusion besets him, 
then in his rumpled memory associ- 
ations stir, yawn, stretch, awaken. 
Hot Dog! She, she is the contact! 

“Do I dare to eat a peach?” he 
stage-whispers. 

“Let us go then, you and I, when 
the evening is spread out against the 
sky,” she countersigns with relief. 

“What evening, here in perpetual 
sunlamp day?” 

“Eight o’clock earth-time, cubi- 
cle 72, level J, staff quarters.” As 
she leans over Scrip to tidy the 
peach in its dish, her right breast 
spills further out of its apron. And 
unmistakably, ten centimeters from 
his own eye, her rightside nipple 
winks at him. 

Is this proof that she is, or cannot 
be, an automaton? Now she spins 
briskly, as only waitresses can, and 
walks away. The peach. Scrip per- 



ceives, has been rolled around so 
that the side now visible bears writ- 
ing: 

SHE’S GOT THE STUFF. 
GOOD LUCK, FAT BUDDY. 

GEORGIE 

Dutifully, he eats the message. 

3. THE LUNAR MUSHBED 
EXPERIENCE 

Scrip finds her cubicle on an ac- 
cess gallery behind the hive, against 
the crater wall, marla felign, Slen- 
derette Third Class, is graven on the 
nameplate. 

She opens almost immediately, 
dressed in a high-necked, floor- 
length, heliotrope robe. So erotic is 
this unfamiliar modesty to him that 
he astonishes himself by embracing 
her, without premeditation. Still 
more to his surprise she recipro- 
cates, as if reunited with a lover. 

She has opaques the front wall 
almost completely so that it glows a 
subaquatic green, the twilight of 
moon fishes. They converge on her 
mushbed, fumbling with ardour. It 
is over in no time, by which one 
means that time, like gravity, has 
been suspended here beyond dura- 
tion or judgement thereof, hours or 
minutes. 

To be sure, the Instant Replay on 
the videoscreen at the foot of the 
mushbed would, had they activated 
it, have shown them engaged like 
whirligig gears, mingling hair and 
limbs with fingers and other mem- 
bers vibrant in each others’ every

aperture, doing all things whatever 
that two can do together, or almost 
all. His body like a maddened heart 
and her heliotrope lips moaning 
muffled, delicious, delirious non- 
words and then licking his slippery 
face like a cat. He is above, behind, 
and beneath her and the Colour- 
Organ Light-Show Feedback Acces- 
sory projects on walls and ceiling of 
the rhomboidal octahedron a flam- 
ing ocean, two contraposed spirals 
twisting inwards and upwards in a 
tense electric blue. Then the vortex 
turns inside out, exploding into the 
usual kaleidoscopic firework of mol- 
ten flowers: azure, lime, and hot, 
jellied pink. 

And now Scrip recognizes 
another attraction of lunar gravity 
and hence of the Spa. Moon- 
balling — especially on a mushbed, 
aptly named — allows a new agility 
at .16 G’s, without the total acroba- 
tic challenge of orbital free fall. Ev- 
ery action has an equal but oppo- 
site. All the moon, in fact, simu- 
lates a mushbed; as Scrip has sus- 
pected, not everyone comes here to 
reduce. 

As they lie there enmeshed like 
two spent swimmers, Scrip com- 
pares his newfound corpulence un- 
favourably with Marla’s attenuated 
torso, her breasts like little muffins. 
“I was not always as you see me 
now,” he says, suddenly self- 
conscious. “I’m not really this size 
or bloated shape; it is an alias of the 
flesh, a gross impersonation. Tem- 
porary silicon padding, courtesy of 



our mutual confederate Georgie. A 
few months ago I was as thin as 
you.” 

“Don’t be embarrassed by your 
body, not here in Fat City,” says 
Marla, chewing on his ear. “A year 
ago I weighed more than you do 
now.” 

“You’re pulling my leg!”. it 
isn’t quite his leg. 

“Truly. This is an unsolicited tes- 
timonial: 1 lost it at Selena Spa. It 
can be done, if one cooperates.” 

“I do admire your transforma- 
tion, if not my own. But perhaps 
you wouldn’t like me thin,” Scrip 
says, not sure how seriously he 
means it. 

She squeezes him gingerly. “1 
like you for yourself, Bartleby. You 
have. .eyes I can trust. You’re 
about the only decent person I’ve 
met here.” 

“I’m a crook, Marla. I take ad- 
vantage of human weakness and 
make money off unnecessary mis- 
ery. Balaban, rhymes with Cali- 
ban.” 

“We’re all in this together,” she 
says between love-bites. 

He cannot restrain it, the words 
come welling up unbidden as a 
sneeze: “What’s a girl like you do- 
ing in a job like this? I mean, don’t 
you, having been. .pudgy your- 
self, sympathize with the patrons? 
How can you then subvert 
their. .liberation from pudginess, 
by helping me undo their diets?” 

“An interesting ethical quest- 
ion,” she admits, sucking on his 



24 



GALAXY 




toes. “Philosophically, abstinence 
without temptation is no moral con- 
test. Let no maid call herself chaste 
who hasn’t been chased, right? 
Psychologically, a frequent motiva- 
tion of patrons who succumb to our 
enticements is a sort of self- 
punishment for anticipated guilt. 
Anyway, I’m writing my disserta- 
tion in Practical Psycho-Philosophy 
on it. My research, you see, fi- 
nances itself.” 

“Ah. May I ask you another, 
even more personal question?” She 
strokes him affirmatively. “Can you 
wink the left one too?” 

“Yes, but it’s more difficult. I’m 
not ambidextrous.” 

“How do you do it, in either 
case?” 

“I don’t know, really. After I 
shed all that weight, extra skin 
must’ve been left over. Well, some 
people can wiggle their ears. .” 

Presently Scrip leaves, carrying 
the suitcase Marla has transferred to 
him, and which she had smuggled 
into the Spa; staff luggage isn’t 
checked for contraband. 

The corridor he walks along is 
lined with posters, such as the one 
captioned CARBOHYDRATES 
KILL, showing a half-consumed 
loaf of mouldy bread tagged Exhibit 
‘A’. Another with fat mourners at a 
funeral: Eating Can Damage Your 
Health. 

Surely, thinks Scrip, the Spa is as 
much of a racket as mine, only its 
operational scale lends it the 
euphemistic respectability of Big

Business, avarice institutionalized. 
Am I not also an entrepeneur? On 
the other hand, all thieves and con- 
men are amateur practicing 
socialists; they redistribute the 
wealth. Of course one must allow 
that Robin Hood only robbed from 
the rich because the poor didn’t 
have anything. Ideologically a hairy 
one, Bartleby. 

A racket nevertheless, the Spa. 
Far more permanent ways to reduce 
these days, like by-pass surgery. 
Exercise isn’t really easier under 
moon gravity; as Scrip has discov- 
ered through flying, virtual weight 
may decrease but body mass 
doesn’t. And what of those persis- 
tent medical studies of untoward 
side effects? Calcium atrophication 
after prolonged low gravity: the 
Rubber Bone Syndrome. Yet his 
conscience is tweaked by Marla’s 
disclosure that the Spa’s method 
works, given a bit of will power — 
free will to choose. Carbohydrates 
kill. 

He arrives at the cubicle door of 
Lester and Bertha Blumquist, and is 
admitted. No pleasantries need be 
exchanged, only the thousand New 
Bucks counted out. Scrip opens the 
refrigerated suitcase; all the ingre- 
dients to hand, he deftly prepares 
them behind the concealing suitcase 
lid. Blumquist is drooling like a St. 
Bernard. The blackmarket goodies 
are ready. Two jumbo banana splits, 
each with handfuls of chopped 
walnuts sprinkled lavishly on 
brilliant clouds of whipped cream

surmounting great globular mounds 
of French vanilla, pistacchio, pep- 
permint flake, and peach, sloshing 
in concupiscent chocolate sauce, 
burying monster bananas fit for 
King Kong, boat-shaped krystalene 
dishes, and all topped with paired 
marachino cherries like clowns’ 
noses or nipples too red for their 
own good. 

4. THE ROCKET-COACH TOUR 

The girl literally bouncing 
down the aisle is a specimen art history 
lecture, from the Venus of Willen- 
dorf through Rubens of course to a 
Fragonard water-baby with eyes by 
Renoir. Big and round they are, as 
are also the four or five beachball- 
sized orbs of which she is otherwise 
composed. Softly yielding except 
for the Urchin Look pincushion hair 
and the tiny teardrop pearls at the 
end of her overlong eyelashes, sil- 
very above mirrored contact-lenses. 

“Is this seat taken?’’ she asks, 
sitting next to Scrip. The coach is 
half-empty. 

“You’re Bartleby Scrip,’’ she 
says. “I’ve seen you around.” 

“About two meters around,” 
says Scrip; the girl giggles. 

The driver-guide commences his 
commentary with a sharp preamble 
of static: “ crackle to Lunatrip 
Tours. We’ve been cruising at our 
maximum speed of a thousand 
kilometers an hour, which ’d be fast- 
er than sound if crackle any sound

down now to give you a view of 
Clavius right below, can’t miss it, a 
big hole in the ground. Big means 
in this case two-hundred thirty-five 
kilometers across. Clavius, good 
folks, is a grandaddy crater but we 
got craters in every size, 300,000 
on the Near Side alone more than 
a kilometer across. Somebody 
counted not me ahaha.” 

Clavius in Scrip’s porthole rev- 
erie is like a big empty swimming 
pool, Bartleby thinks. 

Enough to bring on acrophobia, 
but who says Nature abhors a vac- 
uum? That’s the moon all over: a 
bunch of empty swimming pools. 
The guide’s a bigger con than me if 
he can sell its scenery. There’s not 
much for the powers of imaginative 
suggestion to work on, to play with, 
as there is almost anywhere on 
Earth. Even the architectonic clouds 
out the window of a jet, formations 
changing as I watch and presumably 
ever and always changing after I 
pass, if I’m not there to see. Mag- 
nificent desolation my ass, these 
moonscapes boring and dead, not 
eroded enough for the Devil’s An- 
vil, the Old Stone Face, or 
Camelhump Rock. That impossibly 
high-contrast lighting, unmellowed 
by distance and the intervening air. 
Inkspot shadows more substantial 
than the unpicturesquely littered 
rocks which cast them. Beyond en- 
tropy, a ruination that never was 
anything but. Wasteland. In death’s 
dream kingdom / Eyes I dare not 
meet in dreams — 



The eyes of the beachball girl 
upon him, smiling. “I’m Joyce,’’ 
says she, “Joyce James.’’ 

“I’ve seen you around,’’ says 
Scrip. 

“Well, that was Clavius. One of 
five supercraters two hundred 
kilometers or more in diameter. 
Now it just isn’t true crackle you’ve 
seen one you’ve seen them all. You 
good folks gonna know more about 
lunar geography, geology and to- 
pography than you’ll wanna know 
ahaha. We got rifts, we got scarps, 
chain craters, rills, ejecta blankets, 
magma rays, you name it — ’’ 

“Take me to the skinnies, 
Bartleby. New double bill at the 
Pornocopia: “Up Your Ante’’, and 
“Let Them Eat Kate’’ with the 
celebrated scene where her orgasmic 
High C breaks a crystal chandelier. 
It’s not faked, you know.” 

“The Pornocopia? Necking in the 
balcony and popcorn too, with lots 
of melted butter?” 

“Mushbeds in the balcony but no 
popcorn, you silly! Makes me hun- 
gry, though!” 

Rather have the popcorn, myself, 
thinks Scrip cold-bloodedly. 

“You want mountains, we got 
mountains. The Leibnitz Range at 
9000 meters, taller than Everest. Of 
course there’s no sea level to mea- 
sure from, the Seas here don’t hold 
water. 

On your left, Oceanus Procel- 
larum, the Ocean of Storms, bigger 
than the Mediterranean, but don’t 
worry about the weather ahaha. And

27 




Sinus Iridum the Bay of Rainbows 
is as grey as the rest, as you can 
plainly see coming up on your 
right. Crackle. The big crater is Ar- 
chimedes.” 

‘‘Hey Bartleby, know how to do 
the Archimedian Screw?” she is 
whispering. ‘‘Wanna leam?” 

‘‘ Crackle more craters in the 
highlands than the Seas, which may 
therefore be of more recent origin. 
These so-called seas, now, crackle 
fifty per cent glass, that’s right, 
glass, plus a good deal of titanium, 
zirconium — ” 

‘‘I for one never believed in the 
Green Cheese Theory of the moon’s 
materiality,” says Scrip. ‘‘Blue 
cheese, maybe. Roquefort, Danish, 
or possibly Stilton.” 

“Giggle,” goes Joyce, “Making 
me hungry again.” 

Scrip shrugs and turns to the 
porthole, catching a Mephistophe- 
lian reflection smirking back in the 
plastiglas. 

“ — what you call your impact 
halo. Notice the rim wall terraced 
concentrically and the conical peak 
in the middle — ’ ’ 

Like a nipple, thinks Scrip. 
Doubtless titanium. Or an eye, a 
round cartoon eye with a bulging 
pupil. 

“Don’t be alarmed, good folks, 
I’m gonna roll the coach so you can 
get a better angle on that gorgeous 
sky. 

This is what you’re missing 
under those domes, good folks. 
Bigger and brighter stars here, as 

28 



advertised, because on Earth thirty 
per cent of their light gets absorbed 
by the atmosphere. You’ll notice 
they don’t twinkle, either, for the 
same reason. And you won’t be 
able to see the familiar constella- 
tions; too many new stars in be- 
tween the dots to be connected. 
Each and every star, good folks, is 
one and three-sevenths times as 
bright as crackle when seen from 
Earth. Your lunar sky at night con- 
tains about twelve thousand stars, 
twice the terrestrial number. But 
this isn’t bad for daytime, is it?” 

“Faaabulous,” bleats Joyce, 
clutching Scrip’s thigh as they gaze 
together cheek to cheek at the 
sterile sky. “Romantic, innit?” 

Avoiding the porcupine hairdo, 
he murmurs in her ear, slowly but 
urgently: “I am the eggman, the 
Emperor of Ice Cream. I scream, 
you scream, we all scream for ice 
cream.” 

“And another thing you won’t 
see back home, good folks. Isn’t 
she crackle ? Is there any sight like 
it? The Earth’s globe seen from 
here is nearly four times the diame- 
ter of the moon over Miami and 
thirteen times the area. Due to this 
and to the reflectivity of the atmo- 
sphere, Earthshine is seventy times 
as bright as. .moonshine ahaha, 
and I think you’ll agree, good folks, 
that it’s more than worth the price of 
the ticket. ’ ’ 

Later, Scrip buys a colour post- 
card of Clavius but has no one to 
send it to. ★

linear acceleration.” Some readers No. The discovery of a “Dean 
may recall the Dean Drive, which Drive” would mean that every fun- 

29 





damental notion we have about 
physics is dead wrong. It would 
mean a revolution at least as far 
reaching as Einstein’s modification 
of Newton. An anti-gravity device 
like that would have consequences 
reaching far beyond space drives, 
just as e = me 2 affected our lives in 
ways not very obviously associated 
with the velocity of light. 

This doesn’t mean that “Dean 
Drive’’ systems are impossible, of 
course. It does mean that looking at 
their implications is a bigger job 
than I want to take on in a 5000- 
word column. 

Jim’s question was, “What hap- 
pens if we have something that 
gives one gravity acceleration over 
interplanetary distances at reason- 
able costs per ton delivered?” Part of 
the question is easy to answer. Now 
that I’ve got my Texas Instruments 
SR-50 (by the way, they’ve now 
come out with a really marvelous 
device called the SR-51, and I hate 
them for it) 1 can run off a couple 
of tables to show what we could do 
with such a system. 

The figures in Table One assume 
you accelerate half way, turn end 
for end, and decelerate the other 
half, so that you arrive with essen- 
tially no velocity. The numbers 
aren’t exact, because I haven’t ac- 
counted for the velocities of the 
planets in their orbits — but after all, 
Pluto is moving about 5 kilometers 
a second, and Mercury about 50, and 



when you’re playing with velocity 
changes like these, who cares ^about 
the measly 45 km/sec difference be- 
tween the two? For shorter trips the 
effect is even less important, of 
course. 

The numbers are a bit startling if 
you’re not familiar with them. 
Twenty days to Pluto? They won’t 
surprise old time sf readers, though. 
A full gravity is a pretty hefty ac- 
celeration. If you don’t bother with 
turnovers but just blast away, the 
results are given in Table Two, and 
they’re even more indicative of 
what one gee can do. 

Of course, long before you’ve 
reached light-speed at the end of a 
year, you’ll have run into relativis- 
tic effects. We’re only concerned 
with the solar system, though, so 
we can ignore trips longer than a 
month and avoid relativity al- 
together. 

Now we can write the article, 
right? Wrong. The problem is that 
last column in Table One. Just how 
do we expect to get delta-v as big 
as all that? 

Let’s illustrate. As we’ve shown 
in previous columns, delta-v can be 
calculated from mass ratio and 
exhaust velocity. (If you came in 
late, take my word for it; we’ll get 
past the numbers pretty quickly.) 

Now you could hardly call a 
drive economical if the mass ratio 
were much worse than, say, three, 
which means that if you start with 
1,000 tons you’ll arrive with 333. 
What, then, must our exhaust veloc-

ity be to make the simple trip from 
Earth to Mars? 

It’s horrible. About 2,204 
kilometers/second, and what’s hor- 
rible about that is it corresponds to 
a temperature of 50 million degrees 
Kelvin. The interiors of stars are 
that hot, but nothing else is. 

Just how are we going to contain 
a temperature like that? 

One answer might be that we’d 
better learn how; fusion power sys- 
tems may require it. OK, and the 
fusion boys are working on the 
problem. However they solve it, we 
can be sure it won’t be anything 
small that does the trick. 

It’s going to take enormous 
magnetic fields, superconductors, 
heavy structures, and a great deal 
more. After all, nothing material 
can hold a temperature like that 
without instantly vaporizing, and 
even containing the magnetic field 
that holds that kind of energy is no 
simple job. 

Let’s assume we can contain fu- 
sion reactions, though. We know 
immediately that energy is going to 
be no problem for our interplanetary 
civilization. With plentiful energy 
we’ll find that a number of our 
other problems vanish. 

There won’t be many “rare” 
materials, for example; if they’re 
rare and valuable enough, we’ll 
simply make them out of atomic 
building blocks. Of course it may 
be cheaper to go find them some- 
where, such as on Mars or among 
the asteroids, but we’ll always be 

32 



up against competition from the 
transmuters. 

Life on Earth, at least among the 
people of the high-energy civiliza- 
tions, will change drastically. Pollu- 
tion will cease to be a problem (un- 
less the fusion plants themselves are 
polluters, which isn’t impossible). 
The Affluent Society will be with 
us and possibly so will be regula- 
tions and rules, bureaucracy, and all 
the other niceties of a universal 
middle class. 

All this comes as a result of as- 
suming our space drive. More cen- 
tral to our immediate topic is the 
fact that the ships will be quite 
large — Queen Mary or supertanker 
size, not one-man prospector jobs. 
Someone is going to have to put up 
a lot of capital to build them, and 
it’s not likely to be the Bobbsey 
Twins and their kindly uncle build- 
ing ships in the back yard. 

Only governments or very large 
international corporations will be in 
the spaceship operating business, 
that’s for sure. Thus there have to 
be profits in interplanetary travel. 
Not even governments will build 
more than one of these ships simply 
for scientific reasons. There’s got to 
be commercial traffic. 

Next, there’s a technological 
problem: assuming we have fusion 
power and a method of getting elec- 
tricity from it doesn’t necessarily 
give us a space drive. Contrary to 
the notions of a lot of high school 
science teachers back in the 40’s, 
rockets don’t “need air to push 



GALAXY 




against”; but the rocket exhaust cer- 
tainly does need something on the 
rocket to push against. 

What can that be? Perhaps some 
kind of magnetic field, but an 
open-end fusion system is at least 
two orders of magnitude harder to 
build than a “simple” system for 
generating electricity. It’s one thing 
to take 50 million degrees and suck 
electricity out of it, and quite 
another to use that as a reaction 
drive. 

Perhaps I’m not sufficiently im- 
aginative, but for all these reasons I 
decided to shelve the one-g system 
and design the article and story 
around something much simpler. In 
fact, if we had the electric power 
system, we could build these ships 
right now. 

Ion drive systems solve the 
“something to push against” prob- 
lem by shooting charged particles 
out the back end. The ship is 
charged, the particles are charged, 
and they repel each other. You can 
get very high exhaust velocities, in 
the order of 200 km/sec, with ion 
systems. They’re among the most 
efficient drives known. 

The trouble with present ion 
drives is that electricity costs 
weight. As an example, a currently 
useful system needs about 2100 
kilowatts of power to produce one 
pound of thrust. Since the power 
plant weighs in the order of four 
tons, the total thrust is not one g, 
but about 1/10,000 of a gravity. 

It works, but it’s a little slow get-

ting there. Not as slow as you 
might think: it would take about 
140 days to go a full AU, and your 
ship would reach the respectable 
speed of 12 km/sec. Still, it’s 
hardly interplanetary rapid-transit. 

Suppose, though, we had a fusion 
system to generate the electricity. It 
would undoubtedly weigh a lot: 
let’s say 1000 metric tons, or about 
two million pounds, by the time 
we’ve put together the fusion sys- 
tem and its support units. We’d still 
come out ahead, because we’d have 
lots of power to play with. Assum- 
ing exhaust velocities of 200 km/ 
sec, which we can get from 
present-day ion systems, we’d still 
have quite a ship. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



33 





She wouldn’t be cheap, but it’s 
not unreasonable to think of her as 
on a par with modern super tankers. 
She wouldn’t be enormously fast: 
I’ve worked out the thrust for a ship 
massing about 100,000 tons with 
that drive, and she’d get only a 
hundredth of a g acceleration. Still, 
a trip from Earth to Ceres would 
take no more than 70 days, and that 
includes coasting a good part of the 
way to save mass. 

A world-wide civilization was 
built around sailing ships and 
steamers making voyages of weeks 
to months. There’s no reason to be- 
lieve it couldn’t happen in space. 

For example: IBS Agamemnon 
(Interplanetary Boost Ship) masses 
100,000 tons as she leaves Earth 
orbit. She carries up to 2000 pas- 
sengers with their life support re- 
quirements. Not many of these will 
be going first-class, though; many 
will be colonists, or even convicts, 
headed out steerage under primitive 
conditions. 

Her destination is Pallas, which 
at the moment is 4 AU from Earth, 
and she carries 20,000 tons of car- 
go, mostly finished goods, tools, 
and other high-value items they 
don’t make out in the Belt yet. Her 
cargo and passengers were sent up 
to Earth orbit by laser launchers; 
Agamemnon will never set down on 
anything larger than an asteroid. 

She boosts out at 10 cm/sec 2 , 
1/100 gravity, for about 15 days, at 
which time she’s reached about 140 



km/second. Now she’ll coast for 40 
days, then decelerate for another 
15. When she arrives at Pallas 
she’ll mass 28,000 tons. The rest 
has been burned off as fuel and 
reaction mass. It’s a respectable 
payload, even so. 

The reaction mass must be metal- 
lic, and it ought to have a reason- 
ably low boiling point. Cadmium, 
for example, would do nicely. 
Present-day ion systems want 
cesium, but that’s a rare metal — 
liquid, like mercury — and unlikely 
to be found among the asteroids, or 
be cheap enough to use as fuel from 
Earth. 

In a pinch I suppose she could 
use iron for reaction mass. There’s 
certainly plenty of that in the Belt. 
But iron boils at high temperatures, 
and running iron vapor through 
them would probably make an un- 
holy mess out of the ionizing 
screens. The screens would have to 
be made of something that won’t 
melt at iron vapor temperatures. 
Better, then, to use cadmium if you 
can get it. 

The fuel would be hydrogen, or, 
more likely, deuterium, which 
they’ll call “dee”. Dee is “heavy 
hydrogen”, in that it has an extra 
neutron, and seems to work better 
for fusion. We can assume that it’s 
available in tens-of-ton quantities in 
the asteroids. After all, there should 
be water ice out there, and we’ve 
got plenty of power to melt it and 
take out hydrogen, then separate out 
the dee. 



34 



GALAXY 




If it turns out there’s no dee in the 
asteroids it’s not a disaster. Ship- 
ping dee will become one of the 
businesses for interplanetary super- 
tankers. 

Thus we have the basis for an 
economy. Whatever people go to 
the Belt for, they’ll need goods 
from Earth to keep them alive at 
first. Later they’ll make a lot of 
their own, and undoubtedly there 
will be specialization. One rock will 
produce water, another steel, and 
yet another will attract technicians 
and set up industry. One may even 
specialize in food production. 

Travel times are long but not im- 
possible. They change, depending 
on when you’re going where. It 
costs money to boost cargo all the 
way, so bulk stuff like metals and 
ice may be put in the “pipeline”: 
given enough delta-v to put the 
cargo into a transfer orbit. Any- 
where from a year to several years 
later the cargo will arrive at its des- 
tination. If there are steady 
insertions, the deliveries are quite 
regular after that first long wait. 

Speculators may buy up “futures” 
in various goods, thus helping 
capitalize the delivery system. 

People wouldn’t travel from rock 
to rock much. Thus each inhabited 
asteroid will tend to develop its own 
peculiar culture and mores. On the 
other hand, they will communicate 
easily enough. They can receive 
educational television from more 
advanced colonies. They can ex- 
change both technical and artistic 



programs, and generally appreciate 
each other’s problems and achieve- 
ments. 

What kind of people will go out 
there? Remember that life on Earth 
is likely to be soft; those going out 
will be unhappy about something. 
Bureaucracy, perhaps. Fleeing their 
spouses. Sent by a judge who wants 
them off Earth. Adventurers looking 
to make a fortune. Idealists who 
want to establish a “truly free soci- 
ety.” Fanatics for some cult or 
another who want to raise their 
children “properly”. 

All this begins to sound familiar: 
something like the colonial period 
with elements as late as just before 
WW One. 

On the other hand, the “frontier” 
conditions will be so different from 
Earth that the Belters may not be 
too concerned with Earth. What 
Earth does about them is another 
story. 

Given fusion power, Earth could 
go either of two ways: fat and hap- 
py, ignoring the nuts who want to 
live on other planets and 
asteroids — or officious, trying to 
govern the colonies, and sending up 
Air Force or Navy ships to enforce 
edicts set down by bureaucrats 
who’ve been outside once for a 
month and didn’t like it. 

Obviously there’s a story or two 
in either alternative. 

hat kind of government will 
evolve if the rocks are left to them- 
selves? 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



35 





Well, each might seek indepen- 
dence, but they wouldn’t be inde- 
pendent. They’d depend entirely too 
much on commerce. Given the 
enormous investments required to 
build the ships that carry that com- 
merce, they’d depend on big 
monied interests, whether private or 
government. 

The outfits that control the ship- 
ping will make most of the rules, 
then. They might not reach down 
into the colonies themselves to spell 
out laws and regulations, but the 
big decisions will be theirs. If we 
envision several large competing 
companies getting into the act, we 
can envision more room for Belt 

36 



freedom through exploiting that 
competition. 

The corporations themselves will 
have to set up some kind of corpo- 
rate “United Nations’’, simply be- 
cause you can’t do business without 
enforcement of contracts, reason- 
ably stable currencies, and the like. 
Their system may or may not be in- 
fluenced by pressure from Earth — 
depending on how much Earth even 
cares. 

There are probably other futures 
that can be built up from ships of 
this kind, but here is one reasonably 
consistent picture of life among the 
asteroids.

1 he tinker came astridin’, as- 
tridin’ over the Strand, with his 
bullocks — ” 

“Rollo!” 

“Yes, Ma’am.” I’d been singing 
at the top of my lungs, as I do 
when I’ve got a difficult piloting 
job, and I’d forgotten that my wife 
was in the control cab. 1 went back 
to the problem of setting our 16 
thousand tons of ship onto the rock. 

It wasn’t much of a rock. Jeffer- 
son is an irregular-shaped asteroid 
about twice as far out as Earth. It 
measures maybe 70 kilometers by 
50 kilometers, and from far enough 
away it looks like an old mud brick 
somebody used for a shotgun target. 
It has a screwy rotation pattern 
that’s hard to match with, and since 
I couldn’t use the main engines, set- 
ting down was a tricky job. 

Janet wasn’t finished. “Roland 
Kephart, I’ve told you about those 
songs.” 

“Yeah, sure, Hon.” There are 
two inertial platforms in Slingshot, 
and they were giving me different 
readings. We were closing faster 
than 1 liked. 

“It’s bad enough that you teach 
them to the boys. Now the girls 
are — ” 

I motioned toward the open inter- 
com switch, and Janet blushed. We 
fight a lot, but that’s our private 
business. 

The attitude jets popped. “Hear 
this,” I said. “I think we’re going 
in too fast. Brace yourselves.” The 
jets popped again, short bursts that 



stirred up dust storms on the rocky 
surface below. “But I don’t 
think — ” 

The ship jolted into place with a 
loud clang. We hit hard enough to 
shake things, but none of the red 
lights came on. “ — we’ll break any- 
thing. Welcome to Jefferson. We’re 
down.” 

Janet came over and cut off the 
intercom switch, and we hugged 
each other for a second. “Made it 
again,” she said, and I grinned. 

There wasn’t much doubt on the 
last few trips, but when we first put 
Slingshot together out of the wreck- 
age of two salvaged ships, every 
time we boosted out there’d been a 
good chance we’d never set down 
again. There’s a lot that can go 
wrong in the Belt, and not many 
ships to rescue you. 

I pulled her over to me and 
kissed her. “Sixteen years,” I said. 
“You don’t look a day older.” 

She didn’t, either. She still had 
dark red hair, same color as when I 
met her at Elysium Mons Station on 
Mars, and if she got it out of a bot- 
tle she never told me, not that I’d 
want to know. She was wearing the 
same thing I was, a skin-tight body 
stocking that looked as if it had 
been sprayed on. The purpose was 
strictly functional, to keep you alive 
if S linger sprung a leak, but on her 
it produced some interesting curves. 
I let my hands wander to a couple 
of the more fascinating conic sec- 
tions, and she snuggled against me. 

She put her head close to my ear 



38 



GALAXY 




and whispered breathlessly, “Comm 
panel’s lit.” 

“Bat puckey.’’ There was a 
winking orange light, showing an 
outside call on our hailing frequen- 
cy. Janet handed me the mike with 
a wicked grin. “Lock up your 
wives and hide your daughters, the 
tinker’s come to town,” I told it. 

“ Slingshot this is Freedom Sta- 
tion. Welcome back, Cap’n Rollo.” 

“Jed?” I asked. 

“Who the hell’d you think it 
was?” 

“Anybody. Thought maybe 
you’d fried yourself in the solar 
furnace. How are things?” Jed’s an 
old friend. Like a lot of asteroid 
Port Captains, he’s a publican. The 
owner of the bar nearest the landing 
area generally gets the job, since 
there’s not enough traffic to make 
Port Captain a full time deal. Jed 
used to be a miner in Pallas, and 
we’d worked together before I got 
out of the mining business. 

We chatted about our families, 
but Jed didn’t seem as interested as 
he usually is. I figured business 
wasn’t too good. Unlike most as- 
teroid colonies, Jefferson’s indepen- 
dent. There’s no big Corporation to 
pay taxes to, but on the other hand 
there’s no big organization to bail 
the Jeffersonians out if they get in 
too deep. 

“Got a passenger this trip,” I 
said. 

“Yeah? Rockrat?” Jed asked. 

“Nope. Just passing through. 
Oswald Dalquist. Insurance adjus- 



tor. He’s got some kind of policy 
settlement to make here, then he’s 
with us to Marsport.” 

There was a long pause, and I 
wondered what Jed was thinking 
about. “I’ll be aboard in a little,” 
he said. “Freedom Station out.” 

Janet frowned. “That was 
abrupt.” 

“Sure was.” I shrugged and be- 
gan securing the ship. There wasn’t 
much to do. The big work is shut- 
ting down the main engines, and 
we’d done that a long way out from 
Jefferson. You don’t run an ion en- 
gine toward an inhabited rock if you 
care about your customers. 

“Better get the Big’uns to look at 
the inertial platforms, Hon,” I said. 
“They don’t read the same.” 

“Sure. Hal thinks it’s the compu- 
ter.” 

“Whatever it is, we better get it 
fixed.” That would be a job for the 
oldest children. Our family divides 
nicely into the Big Ones, the Little 
Ones, and the Baby, with various 
sub-groups and pecking orders that 
Janet and I don’t understand. With 
nine kids aboard, five ours and four 
adopted, the system can get confus- 
ing. Jan and I find it’s easier to let 
them work out the chain of com- 
mand for themselves. 

I unbuckled from the seat and 
pushed away. You can’t walk on 
Jefferson, or any of the small rocks. 
You can’t quite swim through the 
air, either. Locomotion is mostly a 
matter of jumps. 

As I sailed across the cabin a big 

39 



TINKER 




grey shape sailed up to meet me, 
and we met in a tangle of arms and 
claws. I pushed the tomcat away. 
“Damn it—’’ 

“Can’t you do anything without 
cursing?’’ 

“Blast it, then. I’ve told you to 
keep that animal out of the control 
cab.” 

“I didn’t let him in.” She was 
snappish, and for that matter so was 
I. We’d spent better than 600 hours 
cooped up in a small space with just 
ourselves, the kids, and our pas- 
senger, and it was time we had 
some outside company. 

The passenger had made it more 
difficult. We don’t fight much in 
front of the kids, but with Oswald 
Dalquist aboard the atmosphere was 
different from what we’re used to. 
He was always very formal and po- 
lite, which meant we had to be, 
which meant our usual practice of 
getting the minor irritations over 
with had been exchanged for bot- 
tling them up. 

Jan and 1 had a major fight com- 
ing, and the sooner it happened the 
better it would be for both of us. 

Slingshot is built up out of a 
number of compartments. We add 
to the ship as we have to — and when 
we can afford it. I left Jan to finish 
shutting down and went below to 
the living quarters. We’d been 
down 15 minutes, and the children 
were loose. 

Papers, games, crayons, toys, 
kids’ clothing, and books had all 



more or less settled on the “down” 
side. Raquel, a big bluejay the kids 
picked up somewhere, screamed 
from a cage mounted on one bulk- 
head. The compartment smelled of 
bird droppings. 

Two of the kids were watching a 
TV program beamed out of 
Marsport. Their technique was to 
push themselves upward with their 
arms and float up to the top of the 
compartment, then float downward 
again until they caught themselves 
just before they landed. It took 
nearly a minute to make a full cir- 
cuit in Jefferson’s weak gravity. 

I went over and switched off the 
set. The program was a western, 
some horse opera made in the 
1940’s. 

Jennifer and Craig wailed in uni- 
son. “That’s educational. Dad.” 

They had a point, but we’d been 
through this before. For kids 
who’ve never seen Earth and may 
never go there, anything about 
Terra can probably be educational, 
but I wasn’t in a mood to argue. 
“Get this place cleaned up.” 

“It’s Roger’s turn. He made the 
mess.” Jennifer, being eight and 
two years older than Craig, tends to 
be spokesman and chief petty of- 
ficer for the Little Ones. 

“Get him to help, then. But get 
cleaned up.” 

“Yes, sir.” They worked sullen- 
ly, flinging the clothing into corner 
bins, putting the books into the 
clips, and the games into lockers. 
There really is a place for every- 



40 



GALAXY 




thing in Slingshot, although most of 
the time you wouldn’t know it. 

I left them to their work and went 
down to the next level. My office is 
on one side of that, balanced by the 
“passenger suite” which the second 
oldest boy uses when we don’t have 
paying customers. Oswald Dalquist 
was just coming out of his cabin. 

“Good Morning, Captain,” he 
said. In all the time he’d been 
aboard he’d never called me any- 
thing but ‘Captain’, although he ac- 
cepted Janet’s invitation to use her 
first name. A very formal man, Mr. 
Oswald Dalquist. 

“I’m just going down to recep- 
tion,” I told him. “The Port Cap- 
tain will be aboard with the Health 
Officer in a minute. You’d better 
come down, there will be forms to 
fill out.” 

“Certainly. Thank you, Cap- 
tain.” He followed me through the 
airlock to the level below, which 
was shops, labs, and the big com- 
partment that serves as a main en- 
tryway to Slingshot. 

Dalquist had been a good pas- 
senger, if a little distant. He stayed 
in his compartment most of the 
time, did what he was told, and 
never complained. He had very 
polished manners, and everything 
he did was precise, as if he thought 
out every gesture and word in ad- 
vance. 

I thought of him as a little man, 
but he wasn’t really. I stand about 
six three, and Dalquist wasn’t a lot 
smaller than me, but he acted little. 



He worked for Butterworth Insur- 
ance, which I’d never heard of, and 
he said he was a claims adjustor, 
but I thought he was probably an 
accountant sent out because they 
didn’t want to send anyone more 
important to a nothing rock like Jef- 
ferson. 

Still, he’d been around. He didn’t 
talk much about himself, but every 
now and then he’d let slip a story 
that showed he’d been on more 
rocks than most people; and he 
knew ship routines pretty well. No- 
body had to show him things more 
than once. Since a lot of life sup- 
port gadgetry in Slingshot is Janet’s 
design, or mine, and certainly isn’t 
standard, he had to be pretty sharp 
to catch on so quick. 

He had expensive gear, too. Noth- 
ing flashy, but his helmet was one 
of Goodyear’s latest models, his 
skintight was David Clark’s best 
with “stretch steel” threads woven 
in with the nylon, and his coveralls 
were a special design by Amber- 
crombie and Fitch, with lots of 
gadget pockets and a self-cleaning 
low friction surface. It gave him a 
pretty natty appearance, rather than 
the battered look the old rockrats 
have. 

I figured Butterworth Insurance 
must pay their adjustors more than 1 
thought, or else he had a hell of an 
expense account. 

The entryway is a big compart- 
ment. It’s filled with nearly every- 
thing you can think of: dresses, art 
objects, gadgets and gizmos, spare 



TINKER 



41 




parts for air bottles, sewing 
machines, and anything else Janet 
or I think we can sell in the way- 
stops we make with Slingshot. Janet 
calls it the “boutique”, and she’s 
been pretty clever about what she 
buys. It makes a profit, but like ev- 
erything we do, just barely. 

I’ve heard a lot of stories about 
tramp ships making a lot of money. 
Their skippers tell me whenever we 
meet. Before Jan and 1 fixed up 
Slingshot I used to believe them. 
Now I tell the same stories about 
fortunes made and lost, but the truth 
is we haven’t seen any fortune. 

We could use one. Hal, our old- 
est, wants to go to Marsport Tech, 
and that’s expensive. Worse, he’s 
just the first of nine. Meanwhile, 
Barclay’s wants the payments kept 
up on the mortgage they hold on 
Slinger, fuel prices go up all the 
time, and the big Corporations are 
making it harder for little one-ship 
outfits like mine to compete. 

We got to the boutique just in 
time to see two figures bounding 
like wallabies across the big flat 
area that serves as Jefferson’s land- 
ing field. Every time one of the 
men would hit ground he’d fling up 
a burst of dust that fell like slow- 
motion bullets to make tiny craters 
around his footsteps. The landscape 
was bleak, nothing but rock and 
craters, with the big steel airlock 
entrance to Freedom Port the only 
thing to remind you that several 
thousand souls lived here. 

We couldn’t see it, because the 



horizon’s pretty close on Jefferson, 
but out beyond the airlock there’d 
be the usual solar furnaces, big 
parabolic mirrors to melt down 
ores. There was also a big trench 
shimmering just at the horizon: ice. 
One of Jefferson’s main assets is 
water. About ten thousand years 
ago Jefferson collided with the head 
of a comet and a lot of the ice 
stayed aboard. 

The two figures reached Slingshot 
and began the long climb up the 
ladder to the entrance. They moved 
fast, and I hit the buttons to open 
the outer door so they could let 
themselves in. 

Jed was at least twice my age, 
but like all of us who live in low 
gravity it’s hard to tell just how old 
that is. He has some wrinkles, but 
he could pass for fifty. The other 
guy was a Dr. Stewart, and I didn’t 
know him. There’d been another 
doctor, about my age, the last time 
I was in Jefferson, but he’d been a 
contract man and the Jeffersonians 
couldn’t afford him. Stewart was a 
young chap, no more than twenty, 
born in Jefferson back when they 
called it Grubstake and Blackjack 
Dan was running the colony. He’d 
got his training the way most people 
get an education in the Belt, in 
front of a TV screen. 

The TV classes are all right, but 
they have their limits. I hoped we 
wouldn’t have any family emergen- 
cies here. Janet’s a TV Doc, but 
unlike this Stewart chap she’s had a 
year residency in Marsport General, 



42 



GALAXY 




and she knows the limits of TV 
training. 

We’ve got a family policy that 
she doesn’t treat the kids for any- 
thing serious if there’s another doc- 
tor around, but between her and a 
new TV trained MD there wasn’t 
much choice. 

“Everybody healthy?” Jed asked. 

“Sure.” I took out the log and 
showed where Janet had entered 
‘NO COMMUNICABLE DIS- 
EASES’ and signed it. 

Stewart looked doubtful. “I’m 
supposed to examine everyone my- 
self. 

“For Christ’s sake,” Jed told 
him. He pulled on his bristly mus- 
tache and glared at the young doc. 
Stewart glared back. “Well, ’least 
you can see if they’re still warm,” 
Jed conceded. “Cap’n Rollo, you 
got somebody to take him up while 
we get the immigration forms taken 
care of?” 

“Sure.” I called Pam on the in- 
tercom. She’s second oldest. When 
she got to the boutique Jed sent 
Doctor Stewart up with her. When 
they were gone he took out a big 
book of forms. 

For some reason every rock 
wants to know your entire life his- 
tory before you can get out of your 
ship. I never have found out what 
they do with all the information. 
Dalquist and I began filling out 
forms while Jed muttered. 

“Butterworth Insurance, eh?” 
Hed asked. “Got much business 
here?” 



Dalquist looked up from the 
forms. “Very little. Perhaps you 
can help me. The insured was a 
Mister Joseph Colella. I will need 
to find the beneficiary, a Mrs. Bar- 
bara Morrison Colella.” 

“Joe Colella?” I must have 
sounded surprised because they both 
looked at me. “I brought Joe and 
Barbara to Jefferson. Nice people. 
What happened to him?” 

“Death certificate said accident.” 
Jed said it just that way, flat, with 
no feeling. Then he added, “Signed 
by Dr. Stewart.” 

Jed sounded as if he wanted Dal- 
quist to ask him a question, but the 
insurance man went back to his 
forms. 

When it was obvious that he 
wasn’t going to say anything more, 
I asked Jed. “Something wrong 
with the accident?” 

Jed shrugged. His lips were 
tightly drawn. The mood in my ship 
had definitely changed for the 
worse, and I was sure Jed had more 
to say. Why wasn’t Dalquist asking 
questions? 

Something else puzzled me. Joe 
and Barbara were more than just 
former passengers. They were 
friends we were looking forward to 
seeing when we got to Jefferson. I 
was sure we’d mentioned them sev- 
eral times in front of Dalquist, but 
he’d never said a word. 

We’d taken them to Jefferson 
about five Earth years before. They 
were newly married, Joe pushing 
sixty and Barbara less than half 



TINKER 



43 




that. He’d just retired as a field 
agent for Hansen Enterprises, with a 
big bonus he’d earned in breaking 
up some kind of insurance scam. 
They were looking forward to buy- 
ing into the Jefferson co-op system. 
I’d seen them every trip since, the 
last time two years ago, and they 
were short of ready money like 
everyone else in Jefferson, but they 
seemed happy enough. 

“Where’s Barbara now?” I asked 
Jed. 

“Working for Westinghouse. 
Johnny Peregrine’s office.” 

“She all right? And the kids?” 
Jed shrugged. “Everybody helps 
out when help’s needed. Nobody’s 
rich.” 

“They put a lot of money into 
Jefferson stock,” I said. ‘‘And 
didn’t they have a mining claim?” 
“Dividends on Jefferson Corpora- 
tion stock won’t even pay air taxes.” 
Jed sounded more beat down 
than I’d ever known him. Even 
when things had looked pretty bad 
for us in the old days he’d kept all 
our spirits up with stupid jokes and 
puns. Not now. “Their claim wasn’t 
much good to start with, and with- 
out Joe to work it — ” 

His voice trailed off as Pam 
brought Dr. Stewart back into our 
compartment. Stewart countersigned 
the log to certify that we were all 
healthy. “That’s it, then,” he said. 
“Ready to go ashore?” 

“People waitin’ for you in the 
Doghouse, Captain Rollo,” Jed 
said. “Big meeting.” 



“I’ll just get my hat.” 

“If there is no objection, I will 
come too,” Dalquist said. “I won- 
der if a meeting with Mrs. Colella 
can be arranged?” 

“Sure,” I told him. “We’ll send 
for her. Doghouse is pretty well the 
center of things in Jefferson any- 
way. Have her come for dinner.” 
“Got nothing good to serve.” 
Jed’s voice was gruff with a note of 
irritated apology. 

“We’ll see.” I gave him a grin 
and opened the airlock. 

There aren’t any dogs at the 
Doghouse. Jed had one when he 
first came to Jefferson, which is 
why the name, but dogs don’t do 
very well in low gravs. Like every- 
thing else in the Belt, the furniture 
in Jed’s bar is iron and glass except 
for what’s aluminum and titanium. 
The place is a big cave hollowed 
out of the rock. There’s no outside 
view, and the only things to look at 
are the TV and the customers. 

There was a big crowd, as there 
always is in the Port Captain’s place 
when a ship comes in. More busi- 
ness is done in bars than offices out 
here, which was why Janet and the 
kids hadn’t come dirtside with me. 
The crowd can get rough some- 
times. 

The Doghouse has a big bar run- 
ning all the way across on the side 
opposite the entryway from the 
main corridor. The bar’s got a suc- 
tion surface to hold down anything 
set on it, but no stools. The rest of 



44 



GALAXY 




the big room has tables and chairs 
and the tables have little clips to 
hold drinks and papers in pace. 
There are also little booths around 
the outside perimeter for privacy. 
It’s a typical layout. You can hold 
auctions in the big central area and 
make private deals in the booths. 

Drinks are served with covers and 
straws because when you put any- 
thing down fast it sloshes out the 
top. You can spend years learning 
to drink beer in low gee if you 
don’t want to sip it through a straw 
or squirt it out of a bulb. 

The place was packed. Most of 
the customers were miners and 
shopkeepers, but a couple of tables 
were taken by company reps. I 
pointed out Johnny Peregrine to 
Dalquist. “He’ll know how to find 
Barbara.” 

Dalquist smiled that tight little 
accountant’s smile of his and went 
over to Peregrine’s table. 

There were a lot of others. The 
most important was Habib al Sham- 
lan, the Iris Company factor. He 
was sitting with two hard cases, 
probably company cops. 

The Jefferson Corporation people 
didn’t have a table. They were at 
the bar, and the space between them 
and the other Company reps was 
clear, a little island of neutral area 
in the crowded room. 

I’d drawn Jefferson’s head hon- 
cho. Rhoda Hendrix was Chairman 
of the Board of the Jefferson Corpo- 
ration, which made her the closest 
thing they had to a government. 



There was a big ugly guy with her. 
Joe Hornbinder had been around 
since Blackjack Dan’s time. He still 
dug away at the rocks, hoping to 
get rich. Most people called him 
Horny for more than one reason. 

It looked like this might be a 
good day. Everyone stared at us 
when we came in, but they didn’t 
pay much attention to Dalquist. He 
was obviously a feather merchant, 
somebody they might have some 
fun with later on, and I’d have to 
watch out for him then, but right 
now we had important business. 

Dalquist talked to Johnny Pere- 
grine for a minute and they seemed 
to agree on something because 
Johnny nodded and sent one of his 
troops out. Dalquist went over into 
a comer and ordered a drink. 

There’s a protocol to doing busi- 
ness out here. I had a table all to 
myself, off to one side of the clear 
area in the middle, and Jed’s boy 
brought me a big mug of beer with 
a hinged cap. When I’d had a good 
slug I took messages out of my 
pouch and scaled them out to 
people. Somebody bought me 
another drink, and there was a gen- 
eral gossip about what was happen- 
ing around the Belt. 

Al Shamlan was impatient. After 
about a half hour, which is really 
rushing things for an Arab, he 
called across, his voice very casual, 
“And what have you brought us, 
Captain Kephart?” 

I took copies of my manifest out 
of my pouch and passed them 



TINKER

around. Everyone began reading, 
but Johnny Peregrine gave a big 
grin at the first item. 

“Beef!” Peregrine looked hap- 
py. He had 500 workers to feed. 

“Nine tons,” I agreed. 

“Ten francs,” Johnny said. “I’ll 
take the whole lot.” 

“Fifteen,” A1 Shamlan said. 

I took a big glug of beer and re- 
laxed. Jan and I’d taken a chance 
and won. Suppose somebody had 
flung a shipment of beef into trans- 
fer orbit a couple of years ago? A 
hundred tons could be arriving any 
minute, and mine wouldn’t be 
worth anything. 

Janet and I can keep track of 
scheduled ships, and we know 
pretty well where most of the 
tramps like us are going, but there’s 
no way to be sure about goods in 
the pipeline. You can go broke in 
this racket. 

There was more bidding, with 
some of the storekeepers getting in 
the act. I stood to make a good pro- 
fit, but only the big Corporations 
were bidding on the whole lot. The 
Jefferson Corporation people hadn’t 
said a word. I’d heard things 
weren’t going too well for them, 
but this made it certain. If miners 
have any money, they’ll buy beef. 
Beef tastes like cow. The stuff you 
can make from algae is nutritious, 
but at best it’s not appetizing, and 
Jefferson doesn’t even have the 
plant to make textured vegetable 
proteins — not that TVP is any sub- 
stitute for the real thing. 

46 



Eventually the price got up to 
where only Iris and Westinghouse 
were interested in the whole lot and 
I broke the cargo up, seven tons to 
the big boys and the rest in small 
lots. I didn’t forget to save out a 
couple hundred kilos for Jed, and I 
donated half a ton for the Jefferson 
city hall people to throw a feed 
with. The rest went for about thirty 
francs a kilo. 

That would just about pay for the 
deuterium I burned up coming to 
Jefferson. There was some other 
stuff, lightweight items they don’t 
make outside the big rocks like Pal- 
las, and that was all pure profit. I 
felt pretty good when the auction 
ended. It was only the pre- 
liminaries, of course, and the main 
event was what would let me make 
a couple of payments to Barclay’s 
on Slinger’s mortgage, but it’s a 
good feeling to know you can’t lose 
money no matter what happens. 

There was another round of 
drinks. Rockrats came over to my 
table to ask about friends I might 
have run into. Some of the 
storekeepers were making new 
deals, trading around things they’d 
bought from me. Dalquist came 
over to sit with me. 

“Johnny finding your client for 
you?” I asked. 

He nodded. “Yes. As you 
suggested, I have invited her to 
dinner here with us.” 

“Good enough. Jan and the kids 
will be in when the business is 
over.” 



GALAXY 




Johnny Peregrine came over to 
the Table. “Boosting cargo this 
trip?” 

“Sure.” The babble in the room 
faded out. It was time to start the 
main event. 

The launch window to Luna was 
open and would be for another 
couple hundred hours. After that, 
the fuel needed to give cargo pods 
enough velocity to put them in 
transfer orbit to the Earth-Moon sys- 
tem would go up to where nobody 
could afford to send down anything 
massy. 

There’s a lot of traffic to Luna. 
It’s cheaper, at the right time, to 
send ice down from the Belt than it 
is to carry it up from Earth. Of 
course the Lunatics have to wait a 
couple of years for their water to 
get there, but there’s always plenty 
in the pipeline. Luna buys metals, 
too, although they don’t pay as 
much as Earth does. 

“I think something can be ar- 
ranged,” al Shamlan said. 

“Hah!” Hornbinder was listening 
to us from his place at the bar. He 
laughed again. “Iris doesn’t have 
any dee for a big shipment. Neither 
does Westinghouse. You want to 
boost, you’ll deal with us.” 

I looked at al Shamlan. It’s hard 
to tell what he’s thinking, and not a 
lot easier to read Johnny Peregrine, 
but they didn’t look very happy. 
“That true?” I asked. 

Hornbinder and Rhoda came over 
to the table. “Remember, we sent for 
you,” Rhoda said. 



“Sure.” I had their guarantee in 
my pouch. Five thousand francs up 
front, and another five thousand if I 
got here on time. J’d beaten their 
deadline by 20 hours, which isn’t 
bad considering how many million 
kilometers I had to come. “Sounds 
like you’ve got a deal in mind.” 

She grinned. She’s a big woman, 
and as hard as the inside of an as- 
teroid. I knew she had to be sixty, 
but she had spent most of that time 
in low gee. There wasn’t much 
cheer in her smile. It looked more 
like the tomcat does when he’s 
trapped a rat. “Like Horny says, 
we have all the deuterium. If you 
want to boost for Iris and Westing- 
house, you’ll have to deal with 
us.” 

“Bloody hell.” I wasn’t going to 
do as well out of this trip as I’d 
thought. 

Hornbinder grinned. “How you 
like it now, you goddam bloodsuck- 
er?” 

“You mean me?” I asked. 

“Fucking A. You come out here 
and use your goddam ship a 
hundred hours, and you take more 
than we get for busting our balls a 
whole year. Fucking A, I mean 
you . ’ ’ 

I’d forgotten Dalquist was at the 
table. “If you think boostship cap- 
tains charge too much, why don’t 
you buy your own ship?” he asked. 

“Who the hell are you?” Homy 
demanded. 

Dalquist ignored him. “You 
don’t buy your own ships because 



TINKER 



47 




you can’t afford them. Ship owners 
have to make enormous invest- 
ments. If they don’t make good pro- 
fits they won’t buy ships, and you 
won’t get your cargo boosted at any 
price.” 

He sounded like a professor. He 
was right, of course, but he talked 
in a way that I’d heard the older 
kids use on the Little Ones. It al- 
ways starts fights in our family and 
it looked like having the same result 
here. 

“Shut up and sit down, Homy.” 
Rhoda Hendrix was used to being 
obeyed. Hornbinder glared at Dal- 
quist, but he took a chair. “Now 
let’s talk business,” Rhoda said. 
“Captain, it’s simple enough. We’ll 
charter your ship for the next 700 
hours.” 

“That can get expensive.” 

She looked to al Shamlan and 
Peregrine. They didn’t look very 
happy. “I think I know how to get 
our money back.” 

“There are times when it is best 
to give in gracefully,” al Shamlan 
said. He looked to Johnny Peregrine 
and got a nod. “We are prepared to 
make a fair agreement with you, 
Rhoda. After all, you’ve got to 
boost your ice. We must send our 
cargo. It will be much cheaper for 
all of us if the cargoes go out in 
one capsule. What are your terms?” 

“No deal,” Rhoda said. “We’ll 
charter Cap’n Rollo’s ship, and you 
deal with us.” 

“Don’t I get a say in this?” I 
asked. 

48 



“You’ll get yours,” Hornbinder 
muttered. 

“Fifty thousand,” Rhoda said. 
“Fifty thousand to charter your 
ship. Plus the ten thousand we 
promised to get you here.” 

“That’s no more than I’d make 
boosting your ice.,” I said. I usu- 
ally get 5% of cargo value, and the 
customer furnishes the dee and reac- 
tion mass. That ice was worth a 
couple of million when it arrived at 
Luna. Jefferson would probably 
have to sell it before then, but even 
with discounts, futures in that much 
water would sell at over a million 
new francs. 

“Seventy thousand, then,’’ 
Rhoda said. 

There was something wrong here. 
I picked up my beer and took a 
long swallow. When I put it down, 
Rhoda was talking again. “Ninety 
thousand. Plus your ten. An even 
hundred thousand francs, and you 
get another 1% of whatever we get 
for the ice after we sell it.” 

“A counter offer may be appro- 
priate,” al Shamlan said. He was 
talking to Johnny Peregrine, but he 
said it loud enough to be sure that 
everyone else heard him. “Will 
Westinghouse go halves with Iris on 
a charter?” 

Johnny nodded. 

Al Shamlan’s smile was deadly. 
“Charter your ship to us, Captain 
Kephart. One hundred and forty 
thousand francs, for exclusive use 
for the next 600 hours. That price 
includes boosting a cargo capsule, 



GALAXY 




provided that we furnish you the 
deuterium and reaction mass.” 

“One fifty. Same deal,” Rhoda 
said. 

‘‘One seventy five.” 

‘‘Two hundred.” Somebody 
grabbed her shoulder and tried to 
say something to her, but Rhoda 
pushed him away. “I know what 
I’m doing. Two hundred thou- 
sand.” 

A1 Shamlan shrugged. “You win. 
We can wait for the next launch 
window.” He got up from the ta- 
ble. “Coming, Johnny?” 

“In a minute.” Peregrine had a 
worried look. “Ms. Hendrix, how 
do you expect to make a profit? I 
assure you that we won’t pay what 
you seem to think we will.” 

“Leave that to me,” she said. 
She still had that look: triumph. The 
price didn’t seem to bother her at 
all. 

“Hum.” A1 Shamlan made a ges- 
ture of bafflement. “One thing, 
Captain. Before you sign with Rho- 
da, you might ask to see the 
money. I would be much surprised 
if Jefferson Corporation has two 
hundred thousand.” He pushed 
himself away and sailed across the 
bar to the corridor door. “You 
know where to find me if things 
don’t work out, Captain Kephart.” 
He went out, and his company 
cops came right after him. After a 
moment Peregrine and the other 
Corporation people followed. 

I wondered what the hell I’d got 
myself into this time. 



Rhoda hendrix was trying to be 
friendly. It didn’t really suit her 
style. 

I knew she’d come to Jefferson 
back when it was called Grubstake 
and Blackjack Dan was trying to set 
up an independent colony. Some- 
time in her first year she’d moved 
in with him, and pretty soon she 
was handling all his financial deals. 
There wasn’t any nonsense about 
freedom and democracy back then. 
Grubstake was a big opportunity to 
get rich or get killed, and not much 
more. 

When they found Blackjack Dan 
outside without a helmet, it turned 
out that Rhoda was his heir. She 
was the only one who knew what 
kind of deals he’d made anyway, so 
she took over his place. A year later 
she invented the Jefferson Corpora- 
tion. 

Everybody living on the rock had 
to buy stock, and she talked a lot 
about sovereign rights and govern- 
ment by the people. It takes a lot of 
something to govern a few thousand 
rockrats, and whatever it is, she had 
plenty. The idea caught on. 

Now things didn’t seem to be go- 
ing too well, and her face showed it 
when she tried to smile. “Glad 
that’s all settled,” she said. 
“How’s Janet?” 

“The wife is fine, the kids are 
fine, the ship’s fine, and I’m fine,” 
I said. 

She let the phoney grin fade out. 
“OK, if that’s the way you want it. 
Shall we move over to a booth?” 



TINKER

“Why bother? I’ve got nothing to 
hide,’’ I told her. 

“Watch it,” Hombinder growled. 

“And I’ve had about enough of 
him,” I told Rhoda. “If you’ve got 
cargo to boost let’s get it boosted.” 

“In time.” She pulled some pa- 
pers out of her pouch. “First, here’s 
the charter contract.” 

It was all drawn up in advance. I 
didn’t like it at all. The money was 
good, but none of this sounded 
right. “Maybe 1 should take al 
Shamlan’s advice and — ” 

“You’re not taking the Arabs’ 
advice or their money either,’’ 
Hornbinder said. 

“ — and ask to see your money 
first,” I finished. 

“Our credit’s good,’’ Rhoda 
said. 

“So is mine as long as I keep my 
payments up. I can’t pay off 
Barclay’s with promises.” 1 lifted 
my beer and flipped the top just 
enough to suck down a big gulp. 
Beer’s lousy if you have to sip it. 

“What can you lose?” Rhoda 
asked.. “OK, so we don’t have 
much cash. We’ve got a contract 
for the ice. Ten percent as soon as 
the Lloyd’s man certifies the stuffs 
in transfer orbit. We’ll pay you out 
of that. We’ve got the dee, we’ve 
got reaction mass, what the hell else 
do you want?” 

“Your radiogram said cash,” I 
reminded her. “I don’t even have 
the retainer you promised. Just 
paper.” 

“Things are hard out here.” 



Rhoda nodded to herself. She was 
thinking just how hard things were. 
“It’s not like the old days. Every- 
thing’s organized. Big companies. 
As soon as we get a little ahead, the 
big outfits move in and cut prices 
on everything we sell. Outbid us on 
everything we have to buy. Like 
your beef.” 

“Sure,” I said. “I’m facing 
tough competition from the big 
shipping fleets, too.” 

“So this time we’ve got a chance 
to hold up the big boys,” Rhoda 
said. “Get a little profit. You aren’t 
hurt. You get more than you ex- 
pected.” She looked around to the 
other miners. There were a lot of 
people listening to us. “Kephart, all 
we have to do is get a little ahead, 
and we can turn this rock into a de- 
cent place to live. A place for 
people, not Corporation clients!” 
Her voice rose and her eyes flashed. 
She meant every word, and the 
others nodded approval. 

“You lied to me,” I said. 

“So what? How are you hurt?” 
She pushed the contract papers to- 
ward me. 

“Excuse me.” Dalquist hadn’t 
spoken very loudly, and everyone 
looked at him. “Why is there such 
a hurry about this?” he asked. 

“What the hell’s it to you?” 
Hornbinder demanded. 

“You want cash?” Rhoda asked. 
“All right, I’ll give you cash.” She 
took a document out of her pouch 
and slammed it onto the table. She 
hit hard enough to raise herself a 



50 



GALAXY 




couple of feet out of her chair. It 
would have been funny if she 
wasn’t dead serious. Nobody 
laughed. 

“There’s a deposit certificate for 
every goddam cent we have!” she 
shouted. “You want it? Take it all. 
Take the savings of every family in 
Jefferson. Pump us dry. Grind the 
faces of the poor! But sign that 
charter!” 

“Cause if you don’t,” Hombind- 
er said, “your ship won’t ever 
leave this rock. And don’t think we 
can’t stop you.” 

“Easy.” I tried to look relaxed, 
but the sea of faces around me 
wasn’t friendly at all. I didn’t want 
to look at them so I looked at the 
deposit paper. It was genuine 
enough: you can’t fake the molecu- 
lar documents Zurich banks use. 
With the Jefferson Corporation Seal 
and the right signatures and 
thumbprints that thing was worth 
exactly 78,500 francs. 

It would be a lot of money if I 
owned it for myself. It wasn’t so 
much compared to the mortgage on 
Slinger. It was nothing at all for the 
total assets of a whole community. 

“This is our chance to get out 
from under,” Rhoda was saying. 
She wasn’t talking to me. “We can 
squeeze the goddam corporation 
people for a change. All we need is 
that charter and we’ve got Westing- 
house and the Arabs where we 
want them!” 

Everybody in the bar was shout- 
ing now. It looked ugly, and I 



didn’t see any way out. 

“OK,” 1 told Rhoda. “Sign over 
that deposit certificate, and make 
me out a lien on future assets for 
the rest. I’ll boost your cargo — ” 

“Boost hell, sign that charter 
contract,” Rhoda said. 

“Yeah, I’ll do that too. Make out 
the documents.” 

“Captain Kephart, is this wise?” 
Dalquist asked. 

“Keep out of this, you little son 
of a bitch.” Horny moved toward 
Dalquist. “You got no stake in this. 
Now shut up before I take off the 
top — ” 

Dalquist hardly looked up. “Five 
hundred francs to the first man who 
coldcocks him,” he said carefully. 
He took his hand out of his pouch, 
and there was a bill in it. 

There was a moment’s silence, 
then four big miners started for 
Horny. 

When it was over, Dalquist was 
out a thousand, because nobody 
could decide who got to Hornbinder 
first. 

Even Rhoda was laughing after 
that was over. The mood changed a 
little; Hornbinder had never been 
very popular, and Dalquist was buy- 
ing for the house. It didn’t make 
any difference about the rest of it, 
of course. They weren’t going to let 
me off Jefferson without signing 
that charter contract. 

Rhoda sent over to city hall to 
have the documents made out. 
When they came I signed, and half 
the people in the place signed as 



TINKER 



51 




witnesses. Dalquist didn’t like it, 
but he ended up as a witness too. 
For better or worse. Slingshot was 
chartered to the Jefferson Corpora- 
tion for 700 hours. 

The surprise came after I’d 
signed. I asked Rhoda when she’d 
be ready to boost. 

“Don’t worry about it. You’ll get 
the capsule when you need it.” 
“Bloody hell! You couldn’t wait 
to get me to sign — ” 

“Aww, just relax, Kephart.” 

“I don’t think you understand. 
You have half a million tons to 
boost up to what, fiv, six kilometers 
a second.” I took out my pocket 
calculator. “Sixteen tons of 
deuterium and eleven thousand 
reaction mass. That’s a bloody big 
load. The fuel feed system’s got to 
be built. It’s not something I can 
just strap on and push off — ” 

“You’ll get what you need,” 
Rhoda said. “We’ll let you know 
when it’s time to start work.” 

* * * 

Jed put us in a private dining 
room. Janet came jn later and I told 
her about the afternoon. I didn’t 
think she’d like it, but she wasn’t as 
upset as I was. 

“We have the money,” she said. 
“And we got a good price on the 
cargo, and if they ever pay off we’ll 
get more than we expected on the 
boost charges. If they don’t pay 
up — well, so what?” 

“Except that we’ve got a couple 



of major companies unhappy, and 
they’ll be here long after Jefferson 
folds up. Sorry Jed, but — ” 

He bristled his mustache. “Could 
be. I figure on gettin’ along with 
the corporations too. Just in case.” 
“But what did all that lot 
mean?” Dalquist asked. 

“Beats me.” Jed shook his head. 
“Rhoda’s been making noises about 
how rich we’re going to be. New 
furnace, another power plant, 
maybe even a ship of our own. No- 
body knows how she’s planning on 
doing it.” 

“Could there have been a big 
strike?” Dalquist asked. “Iridium, 
one of the really valuable metals?” 
“Don’t see how,” Jed told him. 
“Look, Mister, if Rhoda’s goin’ to 
bail this place out of the hole the 
big boys have dug for us, that’s 
great with me. I don’t ask questions. ’ ’ 
Jed’s boy came in. “There’s a 
lady to see you.” 

Barbara Morrison Colella was a 
small blonde girl, pug nose, blue 
eyes. She looks like somebody 
you’d see on Earthside TV playing 
a dumb blonde. 

Her degrees said “family 
economics,” which I guess on 
Earth doesn’t amount to much. Out 
here it’s a specialty. To keep a fam- 
ily going out here you better know 
a lot of environment and life sup- 
port engineering, something about 
prices that depend on orbits and 
launch windows, a lot about how to 
get food out of rocks — and something 
about power systems, too. 



52 



GALAXY 




She was glad enough to see us, 
especially Janet, but we got another 
surprise. She looked at Dalquist and 
said, “Hello, Buck.” 

“Hello. Surprised, Bobby?” 

“No. I knew you’d be along as 
soon as you heard.” 

“You know each other, then,” I 
said. 

“Yes.” Dalquist hadn’t moved, 
but he didn’t look like a little man 
any longer. “How did it happen, 
Bobby?” 

Her face didn’t change. She’d 
lost most of her smile when she saw 
Dalquist. She looked at the rest of 
us, and pointed at Jed. “Ask him. 
He knows more than I do.” 

“Mr. Anderson?’’ Dalquist 
prompted. His tone made it sound 
as if he’d done this before, and he 
expected to be answered. 

If Jed resented that he didn’t 
show it. “Simple enough. Joe al- 
ways seemed happy enough when 
he came in here after his shift — ” 
Dalquist looked from Jed to Bar- 
bara. She nodded. 

“ — until the last time. That night 
he got stinking drunk. Kept mutter- 
in’ something about ‘Not that way. 
There’s got to be another way.’ ” 
“Do you know what that 
meant?’ ’ 

“No,” Jed said. “But he kept 
saying it. Then he got really stinking 
and I sent him home with a couple 
of the guys he worked with.” 

“What happened when he got 
home?” Dalquist asked. 

“He never came home, Buck,” 



Barbara said. “I got worried about 
him, but I couldn’t find him. The 
men he’d left here with said he’d 
got to feeling better and left 
them — ” 

“Damn fools,” Jed muttered. 
“He was right out of it. Nobody 
should go outside with that much to 
drink.” 

“And they found him outside?” 
“At the refinery. Helmet busted 
open. Been dead five, six hours. 
Held the inquest right in here, at 
that table al Shamlan was sitting at 
this afternoon.” 

“Who held the inquest?” Dal- 
quist asked. 

“Rhoda.” 

“Doesn’t make sense,” I said. 
“No,” Janet didn’t like it much 
either. “Barbara, don’t you have 
any idea of what Joe meant? Was 
he worried about something?” 
“Nothing he told me about. He 
wasn’t — we weren’t fighting or 
anything. I’m sure he didn’t — ” 
“Humpf.” Dalquist shook his 
head. “What damned fool 
suggested suicide?” 

“Well,” Jed said, “you know 
how it is. If a man takes on a big 
load and wanders around outside, it 
might as well be suicide. Hombind- 
er said we were doing Barbara a 
favor, voting it an accident.” 
Dalquist took papers out of his 
pouch. “He was right, of course. I 
wonder if Hornbinder knew that all 
Hansen employees receive a paid up 
insurance policy as one of their re- 
tirement benefits?”

“I didn’t know it,” I said. 

Janet was more practical. ‘‘How 
much is it worth?” 

“I am not sure of the exact 
amounts,” Dalquist said. “There 
are trust accounts involved also. 
Sufficient to get Barbara and the 
children back to Mars and pay for 
their living expenses there. Assum- 
ing you want to go?” 

“I don’t know,” Barbara said. 
“Let me think about it. Joe and I 
came here to get away from the big 
companies. I don’t have to like 
Rhoda and the city hall crowd to 
appreciate what we’ve got in Jeffer- 
son. Independence is worth some- 
thing.” 

“Indeed,” Dalquist said. He 
wasn’t agreeing with her, and sud- 
denly we all knew he and Barbara 
had been through this argument be- 
fore. I wondered when. 

“Janet, what would you do?” 
Barbara asked. 

Jan shrugged. “Not a fair ques- 
tion. Roland and I made that deci- 
sion a long time ago. But neither 
of us is alone.” She reached for my 
hand across the table. 

As she’d said, we made our 
choice. We’ve had plenty of offers 
for Slingshot, from outfits that 
would be happy to hire us as crew 
for Slinger. It would mean no more 
hustle to meet the mortgage pay- 
ments, and not a lot of change in 
the way we live — but we wouldn’t 
be our own people anymore. We’ve 
never seriously considered taking 
any of the offers. 



“You don’t have to be alone,” 
Dalquist said. 

“I know. Buck.” There was a 
wistful note in Barbara’s voice. 
They looked at each other for a 
long time. Then we sat down to 
dinner. 

* * * 

I was in my office aboard 
Slingshot. Thirty hours had gone by 
since I’d signed the charter contract, 
and I still didn’t know what I was 
boosting, or when. It didn’t make 
sense. 

Janet refused to worry about it. 
We’d cabled the money on to 
Marsport, all of Jefferson’s treasury 
and what we’d got for our cargo, so 
Barclay’s was happy for a while. 
We had enough deuterium aboard 
Slinger to get where we could buy 
more. She kept asking what there 
was to worry about, and I didn’t 
have any answer. 

1 was still brooding about it when 
Oswald Dalquist tapped on the 
door. 

I hadn’t seen him much since the 
dinner at the Doghouse, and he 
didn’t look any different, but he 
wasn’t the same man. I suppose the 
change was in me. You can’t think 
of a man named ‘Buck’ the same 
way you think of an Oswald. 

“Sit down,” I said. That was 
formality, of course. It’s no harder 
to stand than sit in the tiny gravity 
we felt. “I’ve been meaning to say 
something about the way you han- 



54 



GALAXY 




died Homy. I don’t think I’ve ever 
seen anybody do that.” 

His smile was thin, and I guess it 
hadn’t changed either, but it didn’t 
seem like an accountant’s smile any 
more. “It’s an interesting story, ac- 
tually,” he said. “A long time ago 
I was in a big colony ship. Long 
passage, nothing to do. Discovered 
the other colonists didn’t know 
much about playing poker.” 

We exchanged grins again. 

“I won so much it made me 
worry that someone would take it 
away from me, so I hired the 
biggest man in the bay to watch my 
back. Sure enough, some chap ac- 
cused me of cheating, so I called on 
my big friend — ” 

“Yeah?” 

“And he shouted ‘Fifty to the 
first guy that decks him.’ Worked 
splendidly, although it wasn’t pre- 
cisely what I’d expected when I 
hired him — ” 

We had our laugh. 

“When are we leaving, Captain 
Kephart?” 

“Beats me. When they get the 
cargo ready to boost, I guess.” 
“That might be a long time,” 
Dalquist said. 

'* ‘What does that mean?’ ’ 

“I’ve been asking around. To the 
best of my knowledge, there are no 
preparations for boosting a big 
cargo pod.” 

“That’s stupid,” 1 said. “Well, 
it’s their business. When we go, 
how many passengers am I going to 
have?” 



His little smile faded entirely. “I 
wish I knew. You’ve guessed that 
Joe Colella and I were old friends. 
And rivals for the same girl.” 
“Yeah. I’m wondering why 
you — hell, we talked about them on 
the way in. You never let on you’d 
ever heard of them.” 

He nodded carefully. “I wanted 
to be certain. I only knew that Joe 
was supposed to have died in an ac- 
cident. He was not the kind of man 
accidents happen to. Not even out 
here.” 

“What is that supposed to 
mean?’,’ 

“Only that Joe Colella was one 
of the most careful men you will 
ever meet, and I didn’t care to dis- 
cuss my business with Barbara until 
I knew more about the situation in 
Jefferson. Now I’m beginning to 
wonder — ” 

“Dad!” Pam was on watch, and 
she sounded excited. The intercom 
box said again, “Dad!” 

“Right, sweetheart.” 

“You better come up quick. 
There’s a message coming through. 
You better hurry.” 

66 M!ayday mayday mayday.” 
The voice was cold and unemotion- 
al, the way they are when they re- 
ally mean it. It rolled off the tape 
Pam had made. “MAYDAY 
MAYDAY MAYDAY. THIS IS 
PEGASUS LINES BOOSTSHIP

“Lord God.” I wasn’t really 
aware that I was talking. The kids 
had crowded into the control cabin, 
and we listened as the tape went on 
to give a string of numbers, the vec- 
tors to locate Agamemnon precisely. 
I started to punch them into the 
plotting tanks, but Pam stopped me. 

“I already did that, Dad.” She 
hit the activation switch to bring the 
screen to life. 

It showed a picture of our side of 
the Solar System, the inner planets 
and inhabited rocks, along with a 
block of numbers and a long thin 
line with a dot at the end to repre- 
sent Agamemnon. Other dots 
winked on and off: boostships. 

We were the only one that stood 
a prayer of a chance of catching up 
with Agamemnon. 

The other screen lit, giving us 
what the Register knew about 
Agamemnon. It didn’t look good. 
She was an enourmous old cargo / 
passenger ship, over thirty years 
old — and out here that’s old indeed. 



She’d been built for a useful life of 
half that, and sold off to Pegasus 
lines when P&L decided she wasn’t 
safe. 

Her auxiliary power was fur- 
nished by a plutonium pile. If some- 
thing went wrong with it, there was 
no way to repair it in space. With- 
out auxiliary power, the life sup- 
port systems couldn’t function. I 
was still looking at her specs when 
the comm panel lit. Local call, Port 
Captain’s frequency. 

“Yeah, Jed?” I said. 

“You’ve got the Mayday?” 

“Sure. I figure we’ve got about 
60 hours max to fuel up and still let 
me catch her. I’ve got to try it, of 
course.” 

“Certainly, Captain.” The voice 
was Rhoda’s. “I’ve already sent a 
crew to start work on the ftiel pod. 
I suggest you work with them to be 
sure it’s right.” 

“Yeah. They’ll have to work 
damned fast.” Slingshot doesn’t 
carry anything like the tankage a 
run like this would need. 

“One more thing, Captain,” 
Rhoda said. “Remember that your 
ship is under exclusive charter to 
the Jefferson Corporation. We’ll 
make the legal arrangements with 
Pegasus. You concentrate on getting 
your ship ready.” 

“Yeah, OK. Out.” I switched 
the comm system to record. 
“Agamemnon, this is cargo tug 
Slingshot. I have your Mayday. In- 
tercept is possible, but I cannot 
carry sufficient fuel and mass to de- 



56 



GALAXY 




celerate your ship. I must vampire 
your dee and mass, I say again, we 
must transfer your fuel and reaction 
mass to my ship. 

“We have no facilities for taking 
your passengers aboard. We will at- 
tempt to take your ship in tow and 
decelerate using your deuterium and 
reaction mass. Our engines are 
modified General Electric Model 
five-niner ion-fusion. Preparations 
for coming to your assistance are 
under way. Suggest your crew be- 
gin preparations for fuel transfer. 
Over.” 

Then I looked around the cabin. 
Janet and our oldest were ashore. 
“Pam, you’re in charge. Send that, 
and record the reply. You can start 
the checklist for boost. 1 make it 
about 200 centimeters acceleration, 
but you’d better check that. What- 
ever it is, we’ll need to secure for 
it. Also, get in a call to find your 
mother. God knows where she is.’’ 

“Sure, Dad.’’ She looked very 
serious, and I wasn’t worried. Hal’s 
the oldest, but Pam’s a lot more 
thorough. 

The Register didn’t give any- 
where near enough data about 
Agamemnon. I could see from the 
recognition pix that she carried her 
reaction mass in strap-ons alongside 
the main hull, rather than in detach- 
able pods right forward the way 
S linger does. That meant we might 
have to transfer the whole lot before 
we could start deceleration. 

She had been built as a general 
purpose ship, so her hull structure 



forward was beefy enough to take 
the thrust of a cargo pod — but how 
much thrust? If we were going to 
get her down, we’d have to push 
like hell on her bows, and there was 
no way to tell if they were strong 
enough to take it. 

I looked over to where Pam was 
aiming our high gain antenna for 
the message to Agamemnon. She 
looked like she’d been doing this all 
her life, which I guess she had 
been, but mostly for drills. It gave 
me a funny feeling to know she’d 
grown up sometime in the last 
couple of years and Janet and I 
hadn’t really noticed. 

“Pamela, I’m going to need more 
information on Agamemnon, ' ’ I told 
her. “The kids had a TV cast out 
of Marsport, so you ought to be 
able to get through. Ask for any- 
thing they have on that ship. Struc- 
tural strength, fuel handling equip- 
ment, everything they’ve got.’’ 
“Yes, sir.” 

“OK. I’m going ashore to see 
about the fuel pods. Call me when 
we get some answers, but if there’s 
nothing important from Agamemnon 
just hang onto it.” 

“What happens if we can’t catch 
them?” Phillip asked. 

Pam and Jennifer were trying to 
explain it to him as I went down to 
the lock. 

* * * 

Jed had lunch waiting in the 
Doghouse. “How’s it going?” he 



TINKER 



57 




asked when I came in. 

“Pretty good. Damned good, all 
things considered.” The refinery 
crew had built up fuel pods for 
Slinger before, so they knew what I 
needed, but they’d never made one 
that had to stand up to a full fifth of 
a gee. A couple of centimeters is 
hefty acceleration when you boost 
big cargo, but we’d have to go out 
at a hundred times that. 

“Get the stuff from Marsport?” 
“Some of it.” I shook my head. 
The whole operation would be 
tricky. There wasn’t a lot of risk for 
me, but Agamemnon was in big 
trouble. 

“Rhoda’s waiting for you. Back 
room.” 

“You don’t look happy.” 

Jed shrugged. “Guess she’s right, 
but it’s kind of ghoulish.” 
“What—?” 

“Go see.” 

Rhoda was sitting with a trim 
chap who wore a clipped mustache. 
I’d met him before, of course: B. 
Elton, Esq., the Lloyd’s rep in Jef- 
ferson. He hated the place and 
couldn’t wait for a transfer. 

“I consider this reprehensible,” 
Elton was saying when I came in. 
“I hate to think you are a party to 
this, Captain Kephart.” 

“Party to what?” 

“Ms. Hendrix has asked for 
thirty million francs as salvage fee. 
Ten million in advance.” 

I whistled. “That’s heavy.” 

“The ship is worth far more than 
that,” Rhoda said. 

58 



“If I can get her down. There are 
plenty of problems — hell, she may 
not be fit for more than salvage,” I 
said. 

“Then there are the passengers. 
How much is Lloyd’s out if you 
have to pay off their policies? And 
lawsuits?” Rhoda had the tomcat’s 
grin again. “We’re saving you 
money, Mr. Elton.” 

I realized what she was doing. 
“I don’t know how to say this, but 
it’s my ship you’re risking.” 

“You’ll be paid well,” Rhoda 
said. “Ten percent of what we 
get.” 

That would just about pay off the 
whole mortgage. It was also a hell 
of a lot more than the commission- 
ers in Marsport would award for a 
salvage job. 

“We’ve got heavy expenses up 
front,” Rhoda was saying. “That 
fuel pod costs like crazy. We’re go- 
ing to miss the launch window to 
Luna.” 

“Certainly you deserve reason- 
able compensation, but — ’ ’ 

“But nothing!” Rhoda’s grin was 
triumphant. “Captain Kephart can’t 
boost without fuel, and we have it 
all. That fuel goes aboard his ship 
when you’ve signed my contract, 
Elton, and not before.” 

Elton looked sad and disgusted. 
“It seems a cheap — ” 

“Cheap!” Rhoda got up and 
went to the door. “What the hell do 
you know about cheap? How god- 
dam many times have we heard you 
people say there’s no such thing as 

GALAXY 




an excess profit? Well, this time we 
got the breaks, Elton, and we’ll take 
the excess profits. Think about 
that.” 

Out in the bar somebody cheered. 
Another began singing a tune I’d 
heard in Jefferson before. Pam says 
the music is very old, she’s heard it 
on TV casts, but the words fit Jef- 
ferson. The chorus goes ‘‘THERE’S 
GONNA BE A GREAT DAY!” 
and everybody out there shouted it. 

‘‘Marsport will never give you 
that much money,” Elton said. 

“Sure they will.” Rhoda’s grin 
got even wider, if that was possible. 
“We’ll hold onto the cargo until 
they do — ” 

“Be damned if I will!” I said. 

“Not you at all. I’m sending Mr. 
Hornbinder to take charge of that. 
Don’t worry, Captain Kephart, I’ve 
got you covered. The big boys 
won’t bite you.” 

“Hornbinder?” 

“Sure. You’ll have some extra 
passengers this run — ” 

“Not him. Not in my ship.” 

“Sure he’s going. You can use 
some help — ” 

Like hell. “I don’t need any.” 

She shrugged. “Sorry you feel 
that way. Just remember, you’re 
under charter.” She gave the tomcat 
grin again and left. 

When she was gone Jed came, in 
with beer for me and something else 
for Elton. They were still singing 
and cheering in the other room. 

“Do you think this is fair?” El- 
ton demanded. 



Jed shrugged. “Doesn’t matter 
what I think. Or what Rollo thinks. 
Determined woman, Rhoda Hen- 
drix.” 

“You’d have no trouble over ig- 
noring that charter contract,” Elton 
told me. “In fact, we could find a 
reasonable bonus for you — ” 

“Forget it.” I took the beer from 
Jed and drank it all. Welding up 
that fuel pod had been hot work, 
and I was ready for three more. 
“Listen to them out there,” I said. 
“Think I want them mad at me? 
They see this as the end of their 
troubles.” 

“Which it could be,” Jed said. 
“With a few million to invest we 
can make Jefferson into a pretty 
good place.” 

Elton wasn’t having any. 
“Lloyd’s is not in the business of 
subsidizing colonies that cannot 
make a living — ” 

“So what?” I said. “Rhoda’s got 
the dee and nobody else had 
enough. She means it, you know.” 

“There’s less than 40 hours,” 
Jed reminded him. “I think I’d get 
on the line to my bosses, was I 
you.” 

“Yes.” Elton had recovered his 
polish, but his eyes were narrow. 
“I’ll just do that.” 

They launched the big fuel pod 
with strap-on solids, just enough 
thrust to get it away from the rock 
so I could catch it and lock on. We 
had hours to spare, and I took my 
time matching velocities. Then Hal 



TINKER 



59 




and I went outside to make sure ev- 
erything was connected right. 

Hornbinder and two friends were 
aboard against all my protests. They 
wanted to come out with us, but I 
wasn’t having any. We don’t need 
help from groundpounders. Janet 
and Pam took them to the galley for 
coffee while 1 made my inspection. 

Slingshot is basically a strongly 
built hollow tube with engines at 
one end and clamps at the other. 
The cabins are rings around the out- 
side of the tube. We also carry 
some deuterium and reaction mass 
strapped on to the main hull, but for 
big jobs there’s not nearly enough 
room there. Instead, we build a 
special fuel pod that straps onto the 
bow. The reaction mass can be 
lowered through the central tube 
when we’re boosting. 

Boost cargo goes on forward of 
the fuel pod. This time we didn’t 
have any going out, but when we 
caught up to Agamemnon she’d ride 
there, no different from any other 
cargo capsule. That was the plan, 
anyway. Taking another ship in tow 
isn’t precisely common out here. 

Everything matched up. Deute- 
rium lines, and the elevator sys- 
tem for handling the mass and 
getting it into the boiling pots aft; it 
all fit. Took our time, even after we 
were sure it was working, while the 
miners who’d come up with the pod 
fussed and worried. Eventually I was 
satisfied and they got to head for 
home. I was still waiting for a call 
from Janet. 

60 



Just before they were ready to 
start up she hailed us. She used an 
open frequency so the miners could 
hear. “Rollo, I’m afraid those 
crewmen Rhoda loaned us will have 
to go home with the others.” 

“Eh?” One of the miners turned 
around in the saddle. 

“What’s the problem, Jan?” I 
asked. 

“It seems Mr. Hornbinder and 
his friends have very bad stomach 
problems. It could be quite serious. 

I think they’d better see Dr. Stewart 
as soon as possible.” 

“Goddam. Rhoda’s not going to 
like this,” the foreman said. He 
maneuvered his little open frame 
scooter over to the airlock. Pam 
brought his friends out and saw they 
were strapped in. 

“Hurry up!” Hornbinder said. 
“Get moving!” 

“Sure, Horny.” There was a 
puzzled note in the foreman’s voice. 
He started up the bike. At 
maximum thrust it might make a 
twentieth of a gee. There was no en- 
closed space, it was just a small 
chemical rocket with saddles, and 
you rode it in your suit. 

“Goddamit, get moving,” 
Hornbinder was shouting. If there’d 
been air you might have heard him 
a klick away. “You can make bet- 
ter time than this!” 

I got inside and went up to the 
control cabin. Jan was grinning. 

“Amazing what calomel can 
do,” she said. 

“Amazing.” We took time off 

GALAXY 




for a quick kiss before I strapped 
in. I didn’t feel much sympathy for 
Horny, but the other two hadn’t 
been so bad. The one to feel sorry 
for was whoever had to clean up 
their suits. 

Ship’s engines are complicated 
things. First you take deuterium pel- 
lets and zap them with a big laser. 
The dee fuses to helium. Now 
you’ve got far too much hot gas at 
far too high a temperature, so it 
goes into an MHD system that cools 
it and converts the energy into 
electricity. 

Some of that powers the lasers to 
zap more dee. The rest powers the 
ion drive system. Take a metal, pre- 
ferably something with a low boil- 
ing point like cesium, but since 
that’s rare out here cadmium gener- 
ally has to do. Boil it to a vapor. 
Put the vapor through ionizing 
screens that you keep charged with 
power from the fusion system. 

Squirt the charged vapor through 
more charged plates to accelerate it, 
and you’ve got a drive. You’ve also 
got a charge on your ship, so you 
need an electron gun to get rid of 
that. 

There are only about nine 
hundred things to go wrong with the 
system. Superconductors for the 
magnetic fields and charge plates: 
those take cryogenic systems, and 
those have auxiliary systems to 
keep them going. Nothing’s simple, 
and nothing’s small, so out of 
Slingshot’s 1600 metric tons, well 
over a thousand tons is engine. 



Now you know why there aren’t 
any space yachts flitting around out 
here. Slinger’s one of the smallest 
ships in commission, and she’s 
bloody big. If Jan and I hadn’t hap- 
pened to hit lucky by being the only 
possible buyers for a couple of 
wrecks, and hadn’t had friends at 
Barclay’s who thought we might 
make a go of it, we’d never have 
owned our own ship. 

When I tell people about the en- 
gines they don’t ask what we do 
aboard S linger when we’re on long 
passages, but they’re only partly 
right. You can’t do anything to an 
engine while it’s on. It either works 
or it doesn’t, and all you have to do 
with it is see it gets fed. 

It’s when the damned things are 
shut down that the work starts, and 
that takes so much time that you 
make sure you’ve done everything 
else in the ship when you can’t 
work on the engines. There’s a lot 
of maintenance, as you might guess 
when you consider that we’ve got to 
make everything we need, from air 
to zweiback. Living in a ship makes 
you appreciate planets. 

Space operations go smooth, or 
generally they don’t go at all. I 
looked at Jan and we gave each 
other a quick wink. It’s a good luck 
charm we’ve developed. Then I hit 
the keys, and we were off. 

It wasn’t a long boost to catch up 
with Agamemnon. I spent most of it 
in the contoured chair in front of 
the control screens. A fifth of a gee 



TINKER 



61 




isn’t much for dirtsiders, but out 
here it’s ten times what we’re used 
to. Even the cats hate it. 

The high gees saved us on high 
calcium foods and the drugs we 
need to keep going in low gravs, 
and of course we didn’t have to put 
in so much time in the exercise har- 
nesses, but the only one happy 
about it was Dalquist. He came up 
to the control cab about an hour out 
from Jefferson. 

“I thought there would be other 
passengers,” he said. 

“Really? Barbara made it pretty 
clear that she wasn’t interested in 
Pallas. Might go to Mars, but — ” 

“No, 1 meant Mr. Hornbinder.” 

“He, uh, seems to have become 
ill. So did his friends. Happened 
quite suddenly.” 

Dalquist frowned. “I wish you 
hadn’t done that.” 

“Really? Why?” 

“It might not have been wise, 
Captain.” 

I turned away from the screens to 
face him. “Look, Mr. Dalquist, I’m 
not sure what you’re doing on this 
trip. I sure didn’t need Rhoda’s 
goons along.” 

“Yes. Well, there’s nothing to be 
done now, in any event.” 

“Just why are you aboard? I 
thought you were in a hurry to get 
back to Marsport — ” 

“Butterworth interests may be af- 
fected, Captain. And I’m in no hur- 
ry” 

That’s all he had to say about it, 
too, no matter how hard I pressed 

62 



him on it. 

I didn’t have time to worry about 
it. As we boosted I was talking with 
Agamemnon. She passed about half 
a million kilometers from Jefferson, 
which is awfully close out here. 
We’d started boosting before she 
was abreast of the rock, and now 
we were chasing her. The idea was 
to catch up to her just as we 
matched her velocity. Meanwhile, 
Agamemnon’ s crew had their work 
cut out. 

* * * 

^^hen we were fifty kilometers 
behind, I cut the engines to 
minimum power. I didn’t dare shut 
them down entirely. The fusion 
power system offers no difficulty 
with re-starts, but the ion screens 
foul when they’re cooled. Unless 
they’re cleaned or replaced we can 
lose as much as half our thrust — 
and we were going to need every 
dyne. 

We could just make out 
Agamemnon with our telescope. She 
was too far away to let us see any 
details. We could see a bright spot 
of light approaching us, though: 
Captain Jason Ewert-James and two 
of his engineering officers. They 
were using one of Agamemnon’s 
scooters. 

There wasn’t anything larger 
aboard. It’s not practical to carry 
lifeboats for the entire crew and 
passenger list, so they have none at 
all on the larger boostships. Earth- 

GALAXY 




side politicians are forever talking 
about “requiring” lifeboats on 
passenger-carrying ships, but they’ll 
never do it. Even if they pass such 
laws, how could they enforce them? 
Earth has no cops in space. The US 
and Soviet Air Forces keep a few 
ships, but not enough to make an 
effective police force, even if any- 
one out here recognized their 
jurisdiction — which we don’t. 

Captain Ewert- James was a typi- 
cal ship captain. He’d formerly 
been with one of the big British- 
Swiss lines, and had to transfer over 
to Pegasus when his ship was sold 
out from under him. The larger 
lines like younger skippers, which I 
think is a mistake, but they don’t 
ask my advice. 

Ewert-James was tall and thin, 
with a clipped mustache and greying 
hair. He wore uniform coveralls 
over his skintights, and in the pock- 
et he carried a large pipe which he 
lit as soon as he’d asked permis- 
sion. 

“Thank you. Didn’t dare smoke 
aboard Agamemnon — ’ ’ 

“Air that short?’’ I asked. 

“No, but some of the passengers 
think it might be. Wouldn’t care to 
annoy them, you know.” His lips 
twitched just a trifle, something less 
than a conspirator’s grin but more 
than a deadpan. 

We went into the office. Jan 
came in, making it a bit crowded. I 
introduced her as physician and 
chief officer. 

“How large a crew do you keep, 



Captain Kephart?” Ewert-James 
asked. 

“Just us. And the kids. My old- 
est two are on watch at the mo- 
ment.” 

His face didn’t change. “Experi- 
enced cadets, eh? Well, we’d best 
be down to it. Mister Haply will 
show you what we’ve been able to 
accomplish.” 

They’d done quite ,a lot. There 
was a lot of expensive alloy bar- 
stock in the cargo, and somehow 
they’d got a good bit of it forward 
and used it to brace up the bows of 
the ship so she could take the thrust. 
“Haven’t been able to weld it prop- 
erly, though,” Haply said. He was 
a young third engineer, not too long 
from being a cadet himself. “We 
don’t have enough power to do 
welding and run the life support 
too.” 

Agamemnon’ s image was a blur 
on the screen across from my desk. 
It looked like a gigantic hydra, or a 
bullwhip with three short lashes 
standing out from the handle. The 
three arms rotated slowly. I pointed 
to it. “Still got spin on her.” 

“Yes.” Ewert-James was grim. 
“We’ve been running the ship with 
that power. Spin her up with at- 
titude jets and take power off the 
flywheel motor as she slows 
down.” 

I was impressed. Spin is usually 
given by running a big flywheel 
with an electric motor. Since any 
motor is a generator, Ewert-James ’s 
people had found a novel way to 



TINKER 



63 




get some auxiliary power for life 
support systems. 

“Can you run for a while without 
doing that?” Jan asked. “It won’t 
be easy transferring reaction mass if 
you can’t.” We’d already explained 
why we didn’t want to shut down 
our engines, and there’d be no way 
to supply Agamemnon with power 
from Slingshot until we were 
coupled together. 

“Certainly. Part of our cargo is 
LOX. We can run twenty, thirty 
hours without ship’s power. Possi- 
bly longer.” 

“Good.” I hit the keys to bring 
the plot-tank results onto my office 
screen. “There’s what I get,” I told 
them. “Our outside time limit is 
Slinger’s maximum thrust. I’d make 
that 20 centimeters for this load — ” 

“Which is more than I’d care to 
see exerted against the bows, Cap- 
tain Kephart. Even with our brac- 
ing.” Ewert-James looked to his 
engineers. They nodded gravely. 

“We can’t do less than ten,” I 
reminded them. “Anything much 
lower and we won’t make Pallas at 
all.” 

“She’ll take ten,” Haply said. “I 
think.” 

The others nodded agreement. I 
was sure they’d been over this a 
hundred times as we were closing. 

1 looked at the plot again. “At 
the outside, then, we’ve got 170 
hours to transfer twenty-five 
thousand tons of reaction mass. And 
we can’t work steadily because 
you’ll have to spin up Agamemnon 

64 



for power, and I can’t stop 
engines — ” 

Ewert-James turned up both cor- 
ners of his mouth at that. It seemed 
to be the closest thing to a smile he 
ever gave. “I’d say we best get at 
it, wouldn’t you?” 

Agamemnon didn’t look much 
like Slingshot. We’d closed to a 
quarter of a klick, and steadily drew 
ahead of her; when we were past 
her we’d turn over and decelerate, 
dropping behind so that we could 
do the whole cycle over again. 

Some features were the same, of 
course. The engines were not much 
larger than Slingshot’s, and looked 
much the same, a big cylinder cov- 
ered over with tankage and coils, 
acceleration outports at the aft end. 
A smaller tube ran from the engines 
forward, but you couldn’t see all of 
it because big rounded reaction 
mass cannisters covered a portion. 

Up forward the arms grew out of 
another cylinder. They jutted out at 
equal angles around the hull, three 
big arms to contain passenger decks 
and auxiliary systems. The arms 
could be folded in between the reac- 
tion mass cannisters, and would be 
when we started boosting. 

All told she was over four 
hundred meters long, and with the 
hundred-meter arms thrust out she 
looked like a monstrous hydra 
slowly spinning in space. 

“There doesn’t seem to be any- 
thing wrong aft,” Buck Dalquist 
said. He studied the ship from the 

GALAXY 




screens, then pulled the telescope 
eyepiece toward himself for a direct 
look. 

“Failure in the superconductor 
system,” 1 told him. “Broken lines. 
They can’t contain the fusion reac- 
tion long enough to get it into the 
MHD system.” 

He nodded. “So Captain Ewert- 
James told me. I’ve asked for a 
chance to inspect the damage as 
soon as it’s convenient.” 

“Eh? Why?” 

“Oh, come now, Captain.” Dal- 
quist was still looking through the 
telescope. “Surely you don’t be- 
lieve in Rhoda Hendrix as a good 
luck charm?” 

“But—” 

“But nothing.” There was no 
humor in his voice, and when he 
looked across the cabin at me there 
was none in his eyes. “She bid far 
too much for an exclusive charter, 
after first making certain that you’d 
be on Jefferson at precisely the 
proper time. She has bankrupted the 
corporate treasury to obtain a corner 
on deuterium. Why else would she 
do all that if she hadn’t expected to 
collect it back with profit?” 

“But — she was going to charge 
Westinghouse and Iris and the 
others to boost their cargo. And 
they had cargo of their own — ” 

“Did they? We saw no signs of 
it. And she bid far too much for 
your charter.” 

“Damn it, you can’t believe 
that,” I said, but I didn’t mean it. I 
remembered the atmosphere back at 



Jefferson. “You think the whole 
outfit was in on it?” 

He shrugged. “Does it matter?” 

The fuel transfer was tough. 
We couldn’t just come alongside 
and winch the stuff over. At first 
we caught it on the fly: Agamem- 
non’ s crew would fling out 
hundred-ton cannisters, then use the 
attitude jets to boost away from 
them, not far, but just enough to 
stand clear. 

Then I caught them with a bow 
pod. It wasn’t easy. You don’t need 
much closing velocity with a 
hundred tons before you’ve got a 
hell of a lot of energy to worry 
about. Weightless doesn’t mean 
massless. 

We could only transfer about four 
hundred tons an hour that way. Af- 
ter the first ten hour stretch I de- 
cided it wouldn’t work. There were 
just too many ways for things to go 
wrong. 

“Get rigged for tow,” I told 
Captain Ewert-James. “Once we’re 
hooked up I can feed you power, so 
you don’t have to do that crazy 
stunt with the spin. I’ll start boost 
at about a tenth of a centimeter. It’ll 
keep the screens hot, and we can 
winch the fuel pods down.” 

He was ready to agree. I think 
watching me try to catch those fuel 
cannisters, knowing that if I made a 
mistake his ship was headed for 
Saturn and beyond, was giving him 
ulcers. 

First he spun her hard to build up 

65 



TINKER 




power, then slowed the spin to 
nothing. The long arms folded 
alongside, so that Agamemnon took 
on a trim shape. Meanwhile I 
worked around in front of her, 
turned over and boosted in the di- 
rection we were travelling, and 
turned again. 

The dopplers worked fine for a 
change. We hardly felt the jolt as 
Agamemnon settled nose to nose 
with us. Her crewmen came out to 
work the clamps and string lines 
across to carry power. We were 
linked, and the rest of the trip was 
nothing but hard work. 

We could still transfer no more 
than 400 tons an hour, meaning 
bloody hard work to get the whole 
25,000 tons into Slinger’s fuel pod, 
but at least it was all downhill. 
Each cannister was lowered by 
winch, then swung into our own 
fuel-handling system where Sling- 
er’s winches took over. Cadmium’s 
heavy: a cube about two meters on 
a side weighs a hundred tons. It 
wasn’t big, and it didn’t weigh 
much in a tenth of a centimeter, but 
you don’t drop the stuff either. 

Finally it was finished, and we 
could start maximum boost: a whole 
ten centimeters, about a hundredth 
of a gee. That may not sound like 
much, but think of the mass in- 
volved. Slinger’s 1600 tons were 
nothing, but there was Agamemnon 
too. I worried about the bracing 
Ewert- James had put in the bows, 
but nothing happened. 

Three hundred hours later we 

66 



were down at Pallasport. As soon as 
we touched in my ship was sur- 
rounded by Intertel cops. 

* * * 

The room was paneled in real 
wood. That doesn’t sound like 
much unless you live in the Belt — 
but think about it: every bit of that 
paneling was brought across 60 
million kilometers. 

Pallas hasn’t much in the way of 
gravity, but there’s enough to make 
sitting down worth doing. Besides, 
it’s a habit we don’t seem to be 
able to get out of. There was a big 
conference table across the middle 
of the room, and a dozen corpora- 
tion reps sat at it. It was made of 
some kind of plastic that looks like 
wood; not even the Commission 
brings furniture from Earth. 

Deputy Commissioner Ruth Carr 
sat at a table at the far end, across 
the big conference table from where 
I sat in the nominal custody of the 
Intertel guards. I wasn’t happy 
about being arrested and my ship 
impounded. Not that it would do 
me any good to be unhappy. 

All the big outfits were rep- 
resented at the conference table. 
Lloyd’s and Pegasus Lines, of 
course, but there were others, Han- 
sen Enterprises, Westinghouse, Iris, 
GE, and the rest. 

“Definitely sabotage, then?’’ 
Commissioner Carr asked. She 
looked much older than she really 
was; the black coveralls and cap did 
that. She’d done a good job of con- 

GALAXY 




ducting the hearings, though, even 
sending Captain Ewert-James and 
his engineers out to get new photo- 
graphs of the damage to Agamem- 
non’s engines. He passed them up 
from the witness box, and she 
handed them to her experts at their 
place to her right. 

They nodded over them. 

“I’d say definitely so,” Captain 
Ewert-James was saying. “There 
was an attempt to lay the charge 
pattern such that it might be mistak- 
en for meteorite damage. In fact, 
had not Mr. Dalquist been so insis- 
tent on a thorough examination, we 
might have let it go at that. On 
close inspection, though, it seems 
very probable that a series of 
shaped charges were used.” 

Ruth Carr nodded to herself. 
She’d heard me tell about Rhoda’s 
frantic efforts to charter my ship. 
One of Ewert-James ’s officers tes- 
tified that an engineering crewman 
jumped ship just before Agamemnon 
boosted out of Earth orbit. The In- 
tertel people had dug up the fact 
that he’d lived on Jefferson two 
years before, and were trying to 
track him down now — he’d van- 
ished. 

“The only possible beneficiary 
would be the Jefferson Corpora- 
tion,” Mrs. Carr said. “The con- 
cerns most harmed are Lloyd’s and 
Pegasus Lines — ” 

“And Hansen Enterprises,” the 
Hansen rep said. Ruth Carr looked 
annoyed but she didn’t say any- 
thing. I noticed that the big outfits 



felt free to interrupt her and won- 
dered if they did that with all the 
Commissioners, or just her because 
she hadn’t been at the job very 
long. 

The Hansen man was an older 
chap who looked as if he’d done his 
share of rock mining in his day, but 
he spoke with a Harvard accent. 
“There is a strong possibility that 
the Jefferson Corporation arranged 
the murder of a retired Hansen 
employee. As he was insured by a 
Hansen subsidiary, we are quite 
concerned.” 

“Quite right.” Mrs. Carr jotted 
notes on the pad in front of her. 
She was the only one there I’d seen 
use note paper. The others whis- 
pered into wrist recorders. “Before 
we hear proposed actions, has any- 
one an objection to disposing of 
the matter concerning Captain 
Kephart?” 

Nobody said anything. 

“I find that Captain Kephart has 
acted quite properly, and that the 
salvage fees should go to his ship.” 

I realized I’d been holding my 
breath. Nobody wanted my scalp so 
far as I knew, and Dalquist had 
been careful to show I wasn’t in- 
volved in whatever Rhoda had 
planned — but still, you never know 
what’ll happen when the big boys 
have their eye on you. It was a re- 
lief to hear her dismiss the whole 
business, and the salvage fees 
would pay off a big part of the 
mortgage. I wouldn’t know just 
how much I’d get until the full 



TINKER 



67 




Commission back in Marsport 
acted, but it couldn’t come to less 
than a million francs. Maybe more. 

“Now for the matter of the Jef- 
ferson Corporation.” 

“Move that we send sufficient In- 
tertel agents to take possession of 
the whole damn rock,” the Lloyd’s 
man said. 

“Second.” That was Pegasus 
Lines. 

“Discussion?” Ruth Carr asked. 

“Hansen will speak against the 
motion,” the Hansen rep said. 
“Mr. Dalquist will speak for us.” 

That surprised hell out of me. I 
wondered what would happen, and 
sat quite still, listening. I had no 
business in there, of course. If there 
had been some suspicion that I 
might have been in on Rhoda’s 
scheme I’d never have heard this 
much, and by rights I ought to have 
left when she made her ruling, but 
nobody seemed anxious to throw 
me out. 

“First, let me state the obvious,” 
Dalquist said. “An operation of this 
size will be costly. The use of 
naked force against an independent 
colony, no matter how justified, 
will have serious repercussions 
throughout the Belt — ” 

“Let ’em get away with it and 
it’ll really be serious,” the Pegasus 
man said. 

“Hansen Enterprises has the 
floor, Mister Papagorus,” Commis- 
sioner Carr said. 

Dalquist nodded his thanks. “My 
point is that we should consider al- 

68 



tematives. The proposed action is at 
least expensive and distasteful, if 
not positively undesirable.” 

“We’ll concede that,” the 
Lloyd’s man said. The others mut- 
tered agreement. One of the people 
representing a whole slew of small- 
er outfits whispered “Here comes 
the Hansen hooker. How’s Dalquist 
going to make a profit from this?” 
“I further point out,” Dalquist 
said, “that Jefferson is no more 
valuable than many other asteroids. 
True, it has good minerals and wa- 
ter, but no richer resources than 
other rocks we’ve not developed. 
The real value of Jefferson is in its 
having a working colony and labor 
force — and it is highly unlikely that 
they will work very hard for us if 
we land company police and confis- 
cate their homes.” 

Everybody was listening now. 
The chap who’d whispered earlier 
threw his neighbor an ‘I told you 
so’ look. 

“Secondly. If we take over the 
Jefferson holdings, the result will be 
a fight among ourselves over the 
division of the spoils.” 

There was another murmur of as- 
sent to that. They could all agree 
that something had to be done, but 
nobody wanted to let the others 
have the pie without a cut for him- 
self. 

“Finally. It is by no means clear 
that any large number of Jefferson 
inhabitants were involved in this 
conspiracy. Chairman Hendrix, cer- 
tainly. I could name two or three 

GALAXY 




others. For the rest — who knows?” 

‘‘All right,” the Lloyd’s man 
said. “You’ve made your point. If 
landing Intertel cops on Jefferson 
isn’t advisable, what do we do? I 
am damned if we’ll let them get 
away clean.” 

“I suggest that we invest in the 
Jefferson Corporation,” Dalquist 
said. 

* * * 

The doghouse hadn’t changed. 
There was a crowd outside in the 
main room. They were all waiting 
to hear how rich they’d become. 
When I came in even Hornbinder 
smiled at me. 

They were getting wild drunk 
while Dalquist and 1 met with 
Rhoda in the back room. She didn’t 
like what he was saying. 

“Our syndicate will pay off the 
damage claims due to Pegasus Lines 
and Lloyd’s,” Dalquist told her. 
“And pay Captain Kephart’s sal- 
vage fees. In addition, we will in- 
vest two million francs for new 
equipment. In return you will de- 
liver 40% of the Jefferson Corpora- 
tion stock to us.” 

He wasn’t being generous. With 
a 40% bloc it was a cinch they could 
find enough more among the rock- 
rats for a majority. Some of them 
hated everything Rhoda stood for. 

“You’ve got to be crazy,” 
Rhoda said. “Sell out to a goddam 
syndicate of corporations? We don’t 
want any of you here!” 



Dalquist’ s face was grim. “I am 
trying to remain polite, and it is not 
easy, Ms. Hendrix. You don’t seem 
to appreciate your position. The 
corporation representatives have 
made their decision, and the Com- 
mission has ratified it. You will 
either sell or face something 
worse.” 

“I don’t recognize any commis- 
sions,” Rhoda said. “We’ve always 
been independent, we’re not part of 
your goddam fascist commission. 
Christ almighty, you’ve found us 
guilty before we even knew there ’d 
be a trial! We weren’t even heard!” 
“Why should you be? As you 
say, you’re independent. Or have 
been up to now.” 

“We’ll fight, Dalquist. Those 
company cops will never get here 
alive. Even if they do — ” 

“Oh, come now.” Dalquist made 
an impatient gesture. “Do you re- 
ally believe we’d take the trouble of 
sending Intertel police, now that 
you’re warned? Hardly. We’ll 
merely seize all your cargo in the 
pipeline and see that no ship comes 
here for any reason. How long will 
it be before your own people throw 
you out and come to terms with 
us?” 

That hit her hard. Her eyes nar- 
rowed as she thought about it. “I 
can see you don’t live to enjoy what 
you’ve done — ” 

“Nonsense.” 

I figured it was my turn. “Rho- 
da, you may not belive this, but I 
heard him argue them out of send- 



TINKER 



69 




ing the cops without any warning at 
all. They were ready to do it.” 

The shouts came from the bar as 
Jed opened the door to see if we 
wanted anything. “THERE’S 
GONNA BE A GREAT DAY!” 

“Everything all right here?” Jed 
asked. 

“NO!” Rhoda shoved herself 
away from the table and glared at 
Dalquist. “Not all right at all! Jed, 
he’s—” 

“I know what he’s saying, Rho- 
da,” Jed told her. “Cap’n Rollo 
and I had a long talk with him last 
night.” 

“With the result that I’m speak- 
ing to you at all,” Dalquist said. 
“Frankly, I’d rather see you dead.” 
His face was a bitter mask of 
hatred, and the emotionless expres- 
sion fell away. He hated Rhoda. 
“You’ve killed the best friend I 
ever had, and I find that I need you 
anyway. Captain Anderson has con- 
vinced me that it will be difficult to 
govern here without you, which is 
why you’ll remain nominally in 
control after this sale is made.” 

“No. No sale.” 

“There will be. Who’ll buy from 
you? Who’ll sell to you? This was a 
unanimous decision. You’re not in- 
dependent, no matter how often you 
say you are. There’s no place for 
your kind of nationalism out here.” 

“You bastards. The big boys. 
You think you can do anything you 
like to us.” 

Dalquist recovered his calm as 
quickly as he’d lost it. I think it 

70 



was the tone Rhoda used; he didn’t 
want to sound like her. I couldn’t 
tell if I hated him or not. 

“We can do whatever we can 
agree to do,” Dalquist said. “You 
seem to think the Corporations 
Commission is some kind of gov- 
ernment. It isn’t. It’s just a means 
for settling disputes. We’ve found it 
more profitable to have rules than to 
have fights. But we’re not without 
power, and everyone’s agreed that 
you can’t be let off after trying 
what you did.” 

“So we pay for it,” Jed said. 
Dalquist shrugged. “There’s no 
government out here. Are you ready 
to bring Rhoda to trial? Along with 
all the others involved?” 

Jed shook his head. “I doubt that 
it—” 

“And there’s the matter of res- 
titution, which you can’t make 
anyway. And you’re bankrupt, since 
you sent no cargo to Luna and the 
window’s closed.” 

“Just who the hell is this syndi- 
cate?” Rhoda demanded. 

Dalquist’s expression didn’t 
change, but there was a note of 
triumph in his voice. He’d won, 
and he knew it. “The major sums 
are put up by Hansen Enterprises.” 
“And you’ll be here as their 
rep.” 

He nodded. “Certainly. I’ve been 
with Hansen most of my life, Ms. 
Hendrix. The company trusts me to 
look out for its best interests. As I 
trusted Joe Colella. Until he retired 
he was my best field agent.” 

GALAXY 




She didn’t say anything, but her 
face was sour. 

“You might have got away with 
this if you hadn’t killed Joe,’’ Dal- 
quist said. “But retired or not, he 
was a Hansen man. As I’m sure 
you found when he discovered your 
plan. We take care of our people, 
Ms. Hendrix. Hansen is a good 
company. 

“For company men.’’ Jed’s voice 



was flat. He looked around the 
small back room with its bare rock 
walls, but 1 think he was seeing 
through those walls, out through the 
corridors, beyond to the caves 
where the rockrats tried to make 
homes. “A good outfit for company 
men. But it won’t be the same, for 
us.’’ 

Outside they were still singing 
about the great days coming. ★ 




You know about Athletics Anonymous? You get the urge to exercise,

I’ve been thinking of getting Jerry a subscription. 

In the four years since we met, Jerry has made of me a sailor and a 
skindiver and a backpacker. I now own a Silver Knapsack patch and half 
of a boat ( Ariadne , built by Jerry and a friend I intend to meet some 
day). It’s not that I’ve given up laziness as a way of life. But every so 
often Jerry points at my belly and giggles hysterically, and off we go into 
the wild with half a dozen Boy Scouts, or over to Catalina with Barry 
Workman as crew. (Two Captains, one Crew. Oh, well.) 

Meanwhile, we spent three years writing a novel. Then six months 
writing a second. A collaboration takes practice. We’ve got a third novel 
half written and two more planned. 

The Poumelles and the Heinleins are good friends. It fits, because 
Jerry fits Robert Heinlein’s image of the omnicompetent man. He holds 
Ph.D.s in Psychology and Political Science, a Master’s in Experimental 
Statistics, Bachelor degrees in History and Engineering. He was in the 
aerospace industry, in space medicine, for a full decade, including two 
years as Chief of the Experimental Stress Program, Human Factors 
Laboratories, Boeing Company. He fought in Korea as a Lieutenant. He 
taught in college. He has managed political campaigns for Mayor Yorty, 
and was Executive Assistant to the Mayor in 1969. 

He’s married to a lady as tough and as full of drive as himself. Roberta 
Poumelle teaches in a girls’ jail. They’ve been married for sixteen years; 
the family includes four boys and a dog. 

TINKER 71 




A disillusioned ex-Communist, Jerry now stands somewhere to the 
right of Gengis Khan. “I like to think of myself as a twelfth century lib- 
eral,” he says. 

It’s hardly surprising that he prefers hard science fiction. He speaks 
rudely of stories in which the background is sloppy or badly researched. 
He is as critical of bad sociology, politics, and history as he is of bad 
physics. He finds even the sociology of my own future history unbelieva- 
ble. Fuel considerations make my Belt civilization too inefficient to sur- 
vive, he says; the Belt government would be on Earth. 

Four years ago, over lots of brandy and coffee, we explored the possi- 
bility of collaborating on a novel. At the time Jerry had written some 
short science fiction and two espionage novels. He still pours brandy in 
his coffee; I taught him that. Another result was that he made me an offer 
I couldn’t refuse. 

No, he left his knife in his pocket. He offered to give me full veto 
over any disagreement on the proposed novel, and to do the final rewrite 
from scratch. That was something I insisted on: one of us had to rewrite 
from the beginning, to smooth out any differences in our styles. 

He didn’t know he’d be typing out a 230 ,000- word novel. He com- 
plained bitterly, but he did it. Later we had to cut out 60,000 words. 

It turns out that Jerry’s skills match the holes in mine, and vice versa, 
indecently well. Jerry can handle politics and military matters; I try to 
steer clear of them. I prefer two or three or four people in a room; Jerry 
can handle a full session of Congress. But my imagery is more vivid, and 
there were no aliens at all in his thousand-year-old interstellar Empire un- 
til I dropped the Moties right in the middle of it. 

We’ve been teaching each other, these past four years. I wrote some of 
the conference scenes in A MOTE IN GOD’S EYE. Jerry carved out the 
Motie social system and carved out the Keeper subgroup. We criticize 
each other’s stories, to our mutual benefit. 

We are both competitive types. At the beginning I expect we each 
wondered if the other would hold up his end of the collaboration. Jerry 
says he stopped wondering about me one rainy night when, during a 
brandy-and-coffee session on MOTE, we found that the snails were all 
the Hell over my garden. We went on a snail hunt. We must have killed 
nearly two hundred of the tiny marauders. And Jerry laughed hysterically 
at my determination to get more snails than him. 

No way will either of us fail to put all he’s got into a story. No way 
will we write the same story twice. Our five novels, written and merely 
outlined, include a tale of alien contact and interstellar war and politics, a 
trip through Dante’s Hell, a study of social changes in an arcology, a 
disaster-and-survival novel, and the first serious treatment of alien inva- 
sion since THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. 

It’s rather wonderful, how our advances keep going up.

JON DES CLES 



Autumn in Tryllmynrein. Josep 
Pachryntz stood in his darkened 
room, looking out over the city he 
loved. He wondered when the 
lovely rain would end. It was the 
sort of rain he liked best, the kind 
that is too hard to be a drizzle and 
too soft to chase people back in- 
doors. The rain that infuriates be- 
cause it soaks without pelting. The 
soft shower that makes it easy to 
hate the reason you are out in it. 

They would be out in it now, 
perhaps, the people of Tryllmyn- 
rein, thronging in some small orna- 
mental square, rallying against the 
oppression of the Thinkers. If made 
Josep proud to think that the protest 
was his doing. For without that 
hatred, without that constant 
danger, men would seek the abso- 



lute power of the Thinkers, and 
civilization would collapse. Power 
is a valuable thing, and the men 
who wield it must be made to pay 
for it. Else they become corrupt. 

That was why Josep Pachryntz, 
as the Leader of the Opposition, 
was the most beloved man in the city; 
it was his job to stir the hatred 
of the people against the might of 
the Thinkers. 

• Josep let his eyes wander to the 
other side of the city. Four pillars 
of crimson light proclaimed the lo- 
cation of the Palace of Thought. 
Four identical pillars of golden light, 
one at each side of the tower in 
which he lived, proclaiming the res- 
idence of the Opposition. His eyes 
sank softly over the covered glow 
of Tryllmynrein and came to rest at 
the center, on the swirling pastels of 
the Great Top. It spun and shifted, 
spinning wishes to all those who 
wanted to balance themselves and 
their fortunes against the universe of 
chance. 

The door chimes sounded. Josep 
checked the security panel and 
opened the door. A tall, thin man 
stood outside. He had black hair 
and his face looked as hard as iron. 

“Josep Pachryntz?’’ the man 
asked. 

“Yes.’’ Pachryntz’s heart stirred 
strangely as he saw the almost 
legendary black coveralls of the 
Guardians. It had been rumoured 
that the Thinkers had finally elimi- 
nated the Guardians, for they were 
never seen.

GALAXY 



“I’m Gordon. You ordered a riot 
outside the Palace of Thought?” 

“I did,” said Josep. There was 
something odd about the strict for- 
mality of Gordon’s speech. He let 
his hand slide along the door jamb 
to the button that would summon 
help. 

“Stanmetton is dead.” said Gor- 
don. “The rioters got him. They 
sent you this token of their appreci- 
ation for your work.” Gordon 
reached into his purse and took out 
a small package. 

Josep did not take the package. A 
picture of Stanmetton ran through 
his mind, the Thinker of Tryllmyn- 
rein itself. A small, balding man 
with an ingratiating air who had 
tried all of the thirty years of his of- 
fice to please the people. It would 
be a loss. But that was the price 
one paid for being a Thinker. For 
power. Power that must never be al- 
lowed to become too attractive. 

“All right, then,” said Gordon. 
He unwrapped the package, held 
out its contents for Josep to see. 

Josep reeled against the door, 
stomach churning. It was a part of a 
man. “Who sent this?” he gasped 
after a moment. 

“It doesn’t matter,” said Gor- 
don. “But I’ll tell you. It was Car- 
teling, your deputy. He seemed to 
think you’d be amused at having a 
souvenir.” 

“It’s disgusting.” said Josep 
sharply. “I’ll have him demoted. 
I’ll throw him out!” 

“You won’t have the chance.” 



said Gordon. “When Stanmetton 
was butchered, the Great Top chose 
a new Thinker for Tryllmynrein. 
I’m here to see that you are safely 
conducted to the Palace of Thought. 
Before Carteling and the mob get 
here.” 

Josep Pachryntz shivered slightly. 
The Universe seemed to be just two 
steps away, but if he took those two 
steps he would have to come to 
terms with that statement. That 
statement that had to be a lie. Deep 
inside him he knew that it had to be 
a lie. 

“There’s a button here, by my 
hand,” said Josep. If I push* it there 
will be a hundred of the Opposition 
in here in a matter of minutes. Take 
your damned joke and get out of 
here and I won’t push it.” 

“Guardians have a certain duty,” 
said Gordon. “Go on and push the 
button if you want. Then we’ll both 
die here. It won’t matter to me.” 

Josep slammed the door in Gor- 
don’s face and ran to the tank. He 
pushed the button and watched the 
letters of the news broadcast float 
before him.

Josep smashed the button with his 
fist and went back to the door. 
Gordon was still there, still iron- 
hard, waiting. Josep’s head swam 



THE THINKER OF TRYLLMYNREIN 



75 




as he stepped through the portal. 
Gordon took one step forward and 
had him against the wall with a 
single swift motion. 

Josep struggled, but his breath 
was cut off by an arm against his 
throat. He watched, weakly gasping 
for breath as Gordon brought 
the small, glowing iron to his 
cheek. The smell of his own burned 
flesh crept up his nostrils as he 
tried to cry out at the pain. 

Then it was over and the anesthetic 
took effect. He was branded with 
the sign of the Thinkers; now there 
could never be any escape. 

“Come on,” said Gordon, releas- 
ing him. “We have to hurry. If we 
don’t get to the Palace before sun- 
rise they’ll find you.’’ 

The music and the lights went out 
and the lift stopped. They were in a 
little bubble of darkness, and fear 
was trying to get in. 

“Cafteling is here,” said Gor- 
don. 

A moment passed and then the 
ceiling of the lift glowed cherry red 
and started to melt. Drops of molten 
metal fell to the floor and Josep 
flattened himself against the wall. 
Soon there was a hole in the ceiling 
big enough for a man to pass 
through. 

Gordon leaped up, grabbed the 
glowing edges of the hole and 
pulled himself through. 

“Come on,” he called softly. 

Then Josep, too, leaped up, his 
nerves shrinking from the contact of 



the hot metal. But Gordon had him 
before his hands could make con- 
tact, and he was hefted through 
with only a small burn on his left 
shoulder. Gordon’s hands were 
softly wet and bloody where they 
were not charred. 

A tiny beam of light appeared 
from Gordon’s hand and searched 
the wall of the shaft. “Ah,” he 
said, and pushed a button concealed 
in the safety-catch mechanism. The 
car beneath them started to rise. 

“Does that restore power to the 
building?” Josep asked. 

“No,” said Gordon. “Only to the 
lift cables. Has your organization dis- 
covered the escape-mechanism at the 
top of each building?” 

“Not that I know of,” said 
Josep. 

Gordon shone the light upward 
and picked out the huge machinery 
of the lift. There were great wheels 
and cogs, around which the cables 
passed. As they came closer a sec- 
tion of one wheel slid out revealing 
a door. Gordon led the way through 
it, then shut it behind them to baffle 
pursuit. 

“It won’t open unless they use 
the emergency button,” he said. 
“They’ll think the car was at the 
top to begin with. I don’t think 
anyone knew about your being 
home, did they?” 

“They could have guessed,” said 
Josep. 

“Then they will guess that they 
were wrong when they see that you 
aren’t there.” 



76 



GALAXY 




“They’ll find that. .object 
. .that you dropped in the hall,’’ 
said Josep. 

“True. But that could be a good 
reason for you to go out. They 
don’t know that I delivered it. And 
they won’t find the man who was 
supposed to.” 

They emerged on a tiny balcony. 
The tower of the Opposition was 
covered with such balconies, many 
of them ornamental. It was dark, 
and Pachryntz’s erstwhile ally, the 
rain, was now his cold enemy, 
through which Tryllmynrein was a 
grey glow far beneath them. 

“Will we be safe here?” asked 
Josep. 

“Where there is no one to kill 
you, you are safe,” said Gordon. 
“By definition.” 

“What now?” Josep asked. 

“Take this,” said Gordon. It was 
a tube, about three inches long, 
painted black to make it incon- 
spicuous. Josep recognized it as a 
nelfer beam. 

“Haven’t you anything else I 
could use?” 

“That’s the weapon officially 
prescribed for Thinkers.” said Gor- 
don. “If it’s used properly it can do 
anything from putting the victim to 
sleep to killing. Most of the Think- 
ers are too busy to leam to use it 
properly, so it usually maims or 
paralyzes. You can’t really blame 
them for not caring. The people 
they use it on are generally out to 
kill them.” 

The wind blew harshly at this 



height. In a matter of seconds 
Josep’s silks were soaked through. 
As the mists were whipped away he 
could see the reflected lights on the 
pools and basins of the city far be- 
low. Then the rain shrouded them 
again. 

He wondered what Tryllmynrein 
would look like if it were open to 
the sky instead of all illumination 
being masked. This greatest of 
cities would scintillate like a gigan- 
tic diamond. But then, the glory of 
the Palace and the Opposition 
would be dimmed, and the Great 
Top would be hard to find out there 
at the center. 

“Now!” said Gordon. He leaped 
over the edge of the balcony. Josep 
followed without thinking, and 
found himself caught about the 
waist by Gordon’s powerful arm. 
He got his balance and realized that 
he was sliding through the air on a 
downward trajectory toward the 
lower roof of another building. 

“How does this work?” Josep 
asked. 

“I don’t know,” said Gordon. 
“It’s one of the things the Thinkers 
keep secret.” 

A moment later they landed on 
the wet and slippery roof of the 
building. Gordon held onto Josep 
and led the way across the wet tiles 
to a parapet. Cast metal grillwork 
decorated the side of the building, 
and without looking downward 5 , 
Gordon climbed out and down the 
side. Josep followed, trying to 
block out his fear. 



THE THINKER OF TRYLLMYNREIN 



77 




It took three hours. 

They had io go sideways to 
avoid windows and balconies, and 
when they reached the mosaic 
pavement, Pachryntz’s hands were 
bleeding, his arms ached with the 
unfamiliar exertions and his heart 
pounded in his chest as he leaned 
against the building to catch his 
breath . 

“From now on, we run.” said 
Gordon. The Guardian started off at 
a trot. Josep started to call out to 
him, but instead, followed. 

In a nightmare they ran through 
the wonderland city of Tryllmyn- 
rein, casting eyes about fearfully at 
gaudy-colored gems set in golden 
walls and silken cloths. But rain 
had thinned the puffiness of fashion 
and the folk who walked the streets 
paid them no heed. How merciful, 
thought Josep, that the skies turned 
the overblown inhabitants to thin, 
soaked rats in gay rags, and made 
all unrecognizable. 

Josep ’s mind was fuzzy when he 
fell subject to the insidious music. 
It was a shock for him to note how 
close it was. Ahead and very close 
the Great Top was spinning, and 
that, in itself, sent shivers through 
him. For the Great Top was a two- 
fold god-goddess. It was the answer 
and the question at once, and Josep 
was afraid of it. 

Somewhere the Princess sat, 
watching and deciding. You came 
to the Great Top and made your 
wishes. Sometimes the Great Top 
answered them, and sometimes it 



didn’t. Sometimes the Princess in- 
tervened. But for each wish 
granted, someone had to pay. The 
balance had to be maintained. If 
someone was given joy, someone 
else had to be damned. There were 
rules to be kept, and over all there 
was the Princess. 

You couldn’t know how close 
you had to be to the Great Top for 
your wish to be recorded in the 
Cosmic Bowl, because the effective 
radius was always changing. You 
had to have faith. And you had to 
be brave, to be willing to take a 
fifty-fifty chance. Heaven or Hell. 
Those who dared stood in the circle 
at the base of the Great Top, next 
to the brass rail that guarded the 
point on which it whirled. 

Josep had never risked a wish on 
the Great Top. He didn’t want to. 
He was afraid of that black fifty 
percent. 

Ask the Opposition for Miracles! 
the Thinkers said. 

The music swelled, and Gordon 
led him around a corner and into 
the circle of the Great Top. Josep 
drew back, pressed himself against 
the wall inlaid with ivory figures. 
The Opposition had never dealt in 
miracles, but it could guarantee the 
right to hate, and that with nothing 
in return. There were no chances to 
be taken with the Opposition. 

An Opposition ground-car shot 
out of a street on the other side of 
the circle, and went into orbit 
around the base of the Great Top. 
Josep Pachryntz froze against the 



78 



GALAXY 




wall and stared up at the Great Top. 

It was huge and beautiful, spin- 
ning on its tiny point, leaning first 
to one side, then to the other, as if 
at any moment it would topple, and 
crush the devout, bounce from one 
side of the circle to the other in a 
musical death rite. It was gold and 
pink and purple, and then the col- 
ours became soft, pastel, lavenders 
and orchids. The whole thing turned 
the color of the best persimmons, 
warm, with a frosty purple overlay- 
ing it. 

Josep Pachryntz’s face appeared 
on the side of the Great Top, pro- 
jected from the ground car. It mud- 
died the colors. The rasping voice 
of Carteling blared out and de- 
stroyed the calm spell of the music. 

It was a good trick, thought Pach- 
ryntz with professional pride. One 
he had invented himself. Interrupt 
the faithful at their wishing and they 
will do anything to get rid of you. 
Even run the risk of an unprofitable 
wish that might doom them if it 
came out wrong. 

Of course, the Princess would 
probably intervene if anyone wished 
another dead. But if enough people 
wished Josep Pachryntz caught so 
that they could get back to their 
own wishes, then the odds were that 
Pachryntz would be caught. 

Suddenly Pachryntz remembered 
old Murphy, who was hanged by 
the thumbs over a fire the day he 
was elected. This was the technique 
he’d used on Murphy. And Murphy 
hadn’t wanted to be elected either. 



It didn’t matter at all, he thought, 
whether you wanted it or not. No 
one did. If the Opposition got its 
hands on you. .And as Leader of the 
Opposition, this unwilling act of 
treason would make him the most 
hated Thinker in. 

Pachryntz stopped short in his 
musing. He was a Thinker now, not 
the Leader of the Opposition. His 
loyalties must now be to the Think- 
ers. If they were not, then the bal- 
ance between the Thinkers and the 
Opposition would be upset, and 
civilization in danger. He was the 
enemy now. The men in the Oppos- 
ition car out there in the circle were 
after him. 

Gordon grabbed at his shoulder 
and tried to pull him back into the 
alley. But it was too late. A woman 
stood screaming and pointing at 
him, and the crowd was surging 
toward him. The car stopped and 
shot a spot-light at him. Josep Pach- 
ryntz wished the earth would open 
and swallow him. 

It did. 



A. jagged sword of light jerked 
into being and swiveled around 
them. In the cool, damp darkness 
that followed Josep heard himself 
speak. 

“I wished the earth would swal- 
low me up,” he said. 

‘‘From the looks of this place, it 
did,” Gordon replied a moment later. 

They were in a tunnel with walls 
of unfinished concrete. As Gordon 



THE THINKER OF TRYLLMYNREIN 



79 




led the way around a bend, they 
were faced with the dim glow of a 
fluorescent panel inset with innum- 
erable dials and switches. Several 
massive pillars rose from the floor 
to the ceiling close above their 
heads. 

“We came straight down,” said 
Gordon. “This is the chamber be- 
neath the Great Top. There is a 
tunnel around here somewhere lead- 
ing us to the Palace.” He walked to 
one side of the room, then the 
other. Finally he found the door he 
was seeking. 

“1 didn’t know there were tun- 
nels under the city,’’ said Pach- 
ryntz. 

“You aren’t supposed to. But 
we’ll decide what to do about your 
forbidden knowledge after we get 
you to the Palace.” 

They walked on in silence. The 
tunnel split several times. Josep 
realized that Gordon was following 
a trail of foot-prints in the dust of 
the floor. 

“These tunnels have been sealed 
for centuries,’’ said Gordon. 
“Neither the Thinkers nor the Op- 
position is supposed to know about 
them. Even if Carteling hadn’t al- 
ready been in the building, I 
wouldn’t have brought you through 
the tunnels. Only the Guardians 
know about them, and we don’t use 
them very often. Only when we 
must, such as during the construc- 
tion and assembly of the Great 
Top.” 

“Just what is the function of the 



Guardians?” asked Pachryntz. 

“To maintain the status quo. The 
safety of civilization is our charge.” 
“When are we expected at the 
Palace?” 

“We aren’t expected at all. Not 
many get through these days. The 
Opposition has become most effi- 
cient. If it maintains that efficiency, 
it won’t be too long before the only 
effective people left are the Opposi- 
tion. Then the Great Top will elect 
them as Thinkers. The brains will 
once again belong to the Thinkers, 
and civilization will go on.” 

“What about you?” said Josep. 
“Doesn’t the Great Top ever elect a 
Guardian?” 

“It can’t,” said Gordon. “We 
are dead.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Quite simple,” said Gordon. 
“Thinkers require a degree of 
volition, independence, if you will, 
to make decisions. But we Guar- 
dians don’t need that. We are taken 
at birth and. .corrupted. As men. 
Things are built into us. We can do 
only that which furthers our society. 
We have no will. We are as good 
as dead. The dead are not elected.” 
The footprints went up a thin 
metal stair at the side of the tunnel. 
Gordon went up and opened the 
door. It was dark, and Pachryntz 
felt apprehensive as he followed. 
He heard Gordon cross the room, 
and then the lights went on. 

They were in the midst of a par- 
ty. People stood all about with glass- 
es upraised and laughter on their 



80 



GALAXY 




faces. But there was no sound, no t 
movement. And the people were 1 
covered with dust. There was a i 
faint, unpleasant smell in the room. 1 
“They’re all dead,” said Josep. 
“Yes,” said Gordon. He moved f 
through the gathering toward a door t 
on the other side of the room. “For 
some time now.” ‘ 

Josep followed him. The party 
had spread into the next room. All 
the guests had been caught in r 
mid-motion, frozen. Gordon pushed r 
past a woman in a rotting white v 
gown. She fell to the floor and shat- ) 
tered. A foul smelling cloud of dust s 
arose to choke him. 1 

There were three more such j 
rooms, and then they came out into t 
a clean, well-lighted corridor. Gor- i 
don shut the door of the last room 1 
behind them and they both took a 
breath of the sweet air. 

“Who are they?” asked Josep. r 
“The dead. Does it matter?” r 

“Yes.” f 

“They were,” Gordon said, “the t 
technicians who assembled the £ 
Great Top. When they were i 
finished they had a party. While it t 
was in progress, the rooms were c 
filled with gas and they died t 
quickly and painlessly.” c 

“Why?” said Pachryntz. \ 

“Who knows?” answered Gor- i 
don. He shrugged his shoulders and 
started off down the corridor. r 

“Who killed them?” asked Pach- 
ryntz. c 

“The Guardians, under orders 1 
from the Thinkers. It could have r 

THE THINKER OF TRYLLMYNREIN 



been for any of a million reasons. 
The ultimate reason is balance, as it 
is for all things. Someone must 
live, someone must die.” 

“The Thinkers should be able to 
find a better way of maintaining the 
balance,” said Josep. 

“They should,” agreed Gordon, 
“but they don’t.” 

“Elaborate.” 

‘‘The Thinkers, too, are cor- 
rupted. But only after their election, 
not from birth. That is something 
we take care of when we first bring 
you here. New thoughts, as you 
should have guessed, are dangerous. 
They are likely to endanger the 
power of the Thinkers if they are in 
the wrong hands. And they must be 
in the wrong hands, because the 
Thinkers cannot have new thoughts. ’ ’ 
“Why not?” asked Josep. 
“Because if they were capable of 
new thoughts it would give them 
more power, and that would make 
for an imbalance between the Think- 
ers and the Opposition. The strug- 
gle for power would mount in an 
upward circle until one side over- 
threw the other. That is the function 
of the Guardians. To maintain the 
balance. So we perform a simple 
operation on the Thinkers, to pre- 
vent them from doing anything orig- 
inal.” 

“But the Opposition can have 
new thoughts!” said Josep. 

“True. But, a few new ideas 
cannot prevail against the accumu- 
lated learning of the race. And we 
make sure that the Opposition has 



81 




no time to invent miracles, is kept 
too busy hating.” 

‘‘But if the Thinkers can’t do 
anything new, where do the mira- 
cles come from? Where did the 
Great Top come from?” 

Gordon walked faster, getting a 
few paces ahead of Pachryntz. 

“From these rooms, here, under 
the city,” he said, without turning 
back to Josep. “From this 
warehouse. This museum. When 
they want something new to amuse 
or pacify the people, they delve into 
the ancient records and find a new 
toy. A toy invented tens of 
thousands of years ago, perhaps be- 
fore we came to this world. Before 
the establishment of the status quo. 
Before we were corrupted and in 
turn corrupted the brains of the 
Thinkers.” 

“Before. said Pachryntz. 
“Before. .” Josep’s mind whirled. 
There was a time in his child- 
hood when he had asked ques- 
tions. Questions about. .about 
. .what? About how things 
were before he was in the world. 
He’d been told not to ask such 
questions, and eventually he had 
stopped. For how many generations 
had this gone on? 

“It is all arranged,” said Gor- 
don. A pattern in which we are cor- 
rupted so that we will perform cer- 
tain functions without being able to 
stop ourselves. And there is nothing 
we can ever do to break the pattern, 
save by the wildest chance. A 
chance that is as improbable as the 



results of a wish on the Great 
Top.” 

Pachryntz thought: That is only a 
fifty-fifty proposition. Why. ? 
And then he knew. 

“We’ll have to walk around that 
green line,” said Gordon. They 
were passing an open door. A green 
line was painted in a semi-circle be- 
fore the door. The room itself was 
dark and dusty. “That is the room 
of the Princess,” Gordon continued. 
“Guardians cannot go into it. So it 
isn’t kept clean.” 

Pachryntz stopped. 

“Keep walking,” said Gordon. 
“I can summon a regiment of 
Guardians here in a minute. You 
can’t escape now. You might as 
well come along.” His voice got 
slower and slower. He started to 
turn. 

Josep Pachryntz lifted the small 
black tube in his hand and aimed it 
at Gordon’s head. He fired. 

Gordon fell, but shrieked a warn- 
ing as he did so. Shouts echoed 
down the hall. 

Josep turned and ran into the 
darkness of the Princess’s Room. 
His footsteps sent back tinny echoes 
that testified to the sheer size of the 
place. He held one hand before him 
and walked farther into the black- 
ness. After a while he slowed and 
listened. He turned and looked back 
at the door. It was far away and 
small. 

“Thank you!” The words came 
from somewhere out there in the 
dark. 



82 



GALAXY 




Josep pressed closer to the metal 
of the. .whatever it was. There 
were all manner of things in the 
darkness. Huge metal things of un- 
determinable function, but that were 
warm to the touch. He had sat on 
the floor by this one for a long 
time. 

“Thank you!’’ the words came 
again, the only sound that had dis- 
turbed the deep silence of the place. 
The voice was weak. Gordon was 
out there somewhere, looking for 
him. 

“1 haven’t got long,’’ Gordon 
called. “I don’t blame you if you 
don’t trust me. But listen. You 
haven’t anything to lose by listen- 
ing.” 

Josep let his breath out slowly, 
silently. 

“Do you know about emptiness, 
Josep Pachryntz?” said Gordon. 
There was pain in the voice. “You 
would, if they’d got you to the 
room with the scalpels and probes. 
They do something to you there. 
They seal you off in a little corner 
of your brain, while the rest of it 
does their bidding, lives by their 
rules, thinks their thoughts. 

“Listen, Josep. They gave me 
something to kill the pain. They 
wanted information; I told them I’d 
bring you back. And before they 
could stop to think that a Guardian 
shouldn’t be able to enter this room, 
I had walked across the line. 

You see, you burned away the 
blocks they had built in my brain. I 
can talk now, for the first time in 



my life. I can put my thoughts into 
words. You don’t know what that 
means, Josep, but if you ever leave 
this room, you will. 

“I don’t know what’s in here, 
Josep. 1 took a chance that it might 
be something really important. If 
the Guardians are kept out, it must 
be. But the Thinkers can come in, 
if they want to. You’ve got to hurry 
if you’re going to do anything.” 
The wounded Guardian paused, and 
seemed to laugh. 

“Do something, Josep. Any- 
thing. It doesn’t matter what. But 
the stronger it is, the better.” There 
was a pain-wracked silence, and 
then Gordon continued. “Know 
what I’d do if I had the chance? I’d 
make a wish. I’d wish the whole 
thing were ended. Not just my 
life — everything. 

“Anyway, I wanted to thank 
you, Josep. I wanted to. .thank 
you. Because just talking into the 
darkness like this, not knowing 
whether or not you even hear, is all 
that my life has ever been worth. 
All that has ever mattered. The rest 
is. .less than nothing. 

“I hope you can hear me. But 
don’t take pity and shoot me 
again — they will see the beam and 
get you. Stay free. Do something. 
Avenge us, Josep. Avenge us all!” 

Pachryntz didn’t know whether to 
trust Gordon or not. But then his 
doubts were removed; a tiny spark 
shot across the room from the dis- 
tant portal. It touched the floor be- 
fore Gordon and exploded. In the 



THE THINKER OF TRYLLMYNREIN

light Pachryntz saw the wounded 
man sink to his knees and heard 
him call out: “Gas. .run. .” 
Then Gordon fell and did not move 
again. 

By the dying light of the gas 
bomb Josep had also seen a door 
about sixty feet away. He ran to- 
ward it. A second bomb exploded 
behind him, and he corrected his 
course. A third bomb went off, and 
his hand was on the knob. He 
tugged against the ancient hinges 
and the door slowly opened. With- 
out looking he plunged into the 
green glare that spilled forth. 

Josep stood for long seconds, his 
back against the door, his heart 
pounding, and looked down the 
length of the chamber. The room he 
had just vacated was but an an- 
techamber to this one. Two long 
rows of monstrous metal cubes 
made an aisle at least half a mile in 
length. The cubes were covered 
with meters and dials that glowed 
feebly in the lambent atmosphere. 
The green light came from a huge 
screen at the opposite end of the 
aisle that flickered and swirled and 
beckoned. Josep walked dazedly 
toward it. 

As he approached he noticed a 
chair that was virtually a throne fac- 
ing the base of the screen; a small 
black dot centered at the bottom of 
a three-hundred-foot-high picture. 
For all its massiveness, thd chair 
reminded him by comparison of a 
fly-speck. 

84 



The screen came into focus as he 
approached, and he saw images 
move fleetingly across it. When he 
had nearly reached the chair he saw 
it was occupied. He moved slowly 
around to the front. 

The Princess sat there, waiting. 

Her face was wrinkled and sal- 
low, but it was obvious that she had 
once been beautiful. Her face bore 
a look of fulfillment, a sweet, sad 
contentment that kept her from being 
ghastly, even in death. 

Josep wondered who she was, 
and what she had done. Was she 
from a time before the stagnation of 
civilization, or was she merely a 
Thinker who had found something 
in life? He wished he had known 
her. 

In front of her was a console with 
keys. Each key had two positions, 
and all the keys flickered constant- 
ly. Josep looked from the console to 
the screen and back again. This was 
how the Princess intervened in the 
granting of wishes. But. .it had 
been a long time since the Princess 
had made any judgements. 

Josep reached down and punched 
a button. On the screen a single pic- 
ture came into focus. He watched a 
little boy leap up in delight as a toy 
cart appeared out of nowhere before 
him. 

The key flicked away from under 
his finger and another picture ap- 
peared. A woman turned and rushed 
away as a man whispered into her 
ear. 

The balance was maintained. The 

GALAXY 




boy got his cart, and the woman a 
lost. .what? Josep really didn’t h 
care. She had gambled, and lost, n 
Joy and sorrow were, after all, so ic 
intimately tied together. .for every d 
emotion an equal and opposite emo- a 
tion. 

Josep looked from the console to n 
the screen, and then to the dead si 
Princess. She had died here, playing 1< 
this game, with all the world for her v 
toys. n 

Suddenly Josep Pachryntz caught v 
a glimpse of a pattern, but before it g 
was fully in his grasp, he lost it. An s 
insight, something that made him v 
shudder, a confusion, and then it 
had escaped him, leaving only a s 
sick hunger, an emptiness. tl 

There was a problem. Here, of s 
all places there had to be a solution, tl 
even to a problem such as his. But 
how long could people wait? How tl 
long had they waited? s 

He felt as a physicial weight the v 
centuries in which the Thinkers, the tl 
Guardians, and the Opposition had c 
played their game. Viciously he 
shook the throne and the Princess s 
clattered suddenly to the floor, with 
a paper-dry sound of tearing flesh Vi 
and bones and the susurrus of dry, 
rotting skirts. He seated himself be- C 
fore the screen and watched the w 
myriad images flash by. \* 

Carteling’s face appeared, staring it 
intently at something outside of a 
Pachryntz’ s view. n 

Pachryntz stabbed his finger 
down on the dark side of the key. s 
Carteling ceased to be a problem to e 

THE THINKER OF TRYLLMYNREIN 



anybody. Josep cursed himself for 
his stupidity. For his anger. For the 
nature that left him prey to petty 
ideas and passions and hatreds. He 
didn’t watch what happened to bal- 
ance Carteling’s destruction. 

After many images that he ig- 
nored another face appeared on the 
screen, a face he knew. The image 
loomed larger, seemingly of its own 
volition, as if the wish this man was 
making were too strong to deny. It 
was Gordon, enveloped in deadly 
gases, but clinging to a life he de- 
spised, holding on, and wishing 
with the strength of the dying. 

Had it really been only seconds 
since he had left Gordon for dead in 
the outer chamber? He watched the 
screen intently, waiting for some- 
thing to appear. 

Gordon’s lips moved, and though 
there was no sound, Josep knew in- 
stinctively what the wish was. It 
was as if Gordon were projecting 
the single thought into his mind, so 
clearly did he mouth the words. 

/ wish Pachryntz to find the an- 
swer. 

Josep reached out and pressed the 
white side of the key. 

At first nothing happened, as the 
Great Top studied the problem with 
which it was presented. If there 
were a solution within the range of 
its capabilities, it would solve. But 
as the seconds, the minutes, passed, 
no solution appeared. 

The machines in the throne room 
screamed wildly, tortured beyond 
endurance. All the other keys on the 



85 




board of the console tried to spring 
up to a neutral position, but Josep 
kept that one key firmly depressed 
with the strength of desperation. His 
entire being was focused to one 
purpose — to hold the key down. 

Silence. The screen went black. 
Josep held the key down. Then, 
with a low moan, the greenish light 
returned. Now, one of the black 
keys was depressed, as well. 

His eyes went to the screen, 
searching for the solution, for the 
answer to Gordon’s wish. 

It was dawn, and Tryllmynrein 
lay before him. A light haze 
threaded its way through the beauti- 
ful, shadowed streets. It was a quiet 
time; the people were still asleep. 
The many-balconied buildings with 
their lacquer and gold were set 
against a brilliant blue sky. Josep 
knew the sky was blue, and bril- 
liant, despite the pervading green 
tinge in all the screen’s images. He 
had lived all his life in Tryllmyn- 
rein, and the city lived in his heart, 
alive and full of color. 

First the power went. The pillars 
of light that stood near the Palace of 
Thought, and the towers of the Op- 
position, dimmed and vanished. The 
city ground to a halt; because it was 
a city built and held together with 
various kinds of power. When the 
power was gone, it crumbled. Be- 
fore his eyes, Tryllmynrein crum- 
bled. And Josep knew that he was 
the cause. He was glad that he 
could not hear the screams of the 



millions trapped in the falling build- 
ings. 

The last thing to go was the 
Great Top. It spun wildly and lost 
its equilibrium; its rim touched the 
ground and it crashed into the build- 
ing with the carved ivory inlay and 
shattered. 

The pictures on the screen flick- 
ered wildly. Josep saw the Guard- 
ians, long regiments of them, fall- 
ing dead. He saw the Thinkers 
clutching their heads and tumbling 
off their high stools. He saw blood 
pouring from the mouths and noses 
of the officials of the Opposition. 
Then, as the machines around him 
roared, the screen went black for 
the last time and he was alone in 
the darkness. 

He would never understand; he 
was sure of that. If all this had been 
equal to the solution, then he would 
never understand the problem. But 
it was enough to have provided 
that solution. He waited. 

When the machines were com- 
pletely dead, when there was not a 
sound but the beating of his own 
heart and the singing of his own 
nerves, he took out a pocket lighter 
and made a torch from a twisted 
piece of the Princess’s clothing. By 
that dim, flickering light he found 
the answer, at least in allegory, ly- 
ing on the console in front of him. 

He stared at the small mirror in 
his hand for a long time before he 
went up to watch the sun set and 
help pull survivors from the ruins of 
Tryllmynrein. ★

87 




their plan to throw off the 
structure-yoke once and for all. 

Following a reception in one of 
Ricardo’s five towers, RIVERA 
FRENCH, intelligence chief of the 
Bureau of Tribal Affairs, reports to 
RESTON PROCTOR, Union’s 
Chief Negotiator and head of BTA. 
Both men are upset because Eco- 
freak’s Activist faction is an un- 
known quantity. In the past BTA 
has always negotiated with Ac- 
commodationists. The men know 
nothing about Mycal Bono and not 
much more about JONNY TACK, 
Ecofreak’s ruthless young leader. 

Mention of Tack reminds Proctor 
of a troublesome episode involving 
REGINA UNSLER, only daughter 
of Bernard Unsler, Union’s leader 
(“the Unifier’’). During a stay in 
Ricardo, Tack and Regina fell in 
love, suggesting to the Unifier the 

88 



notion of a Grand Alliance between 
Union and Hinterland to be 
achieved by intermarriage — an 
idea that is abhorrent both to Proc- 
tor and to Jonny Tack’s father, 
both hard-liners. The marriage 
didn’t come off. 

Aside from the fact that the Ac- 
tivists represent an unknown quan- 
tity, Proctor is also worried because 
he is fomenting a plot to overthrow 
the Unsler dynasty — a move that 
will require Ecofreak help. Also, 
BLOTTINGHAM, Unsler’s closest 
aide, has been unusually interested 
in the negotiations. Proctor in- 
structs French to meet with AN- 
DROS BARNEY, Ecofreak’s per- 
manent ambassador in Ricardo, to 
learn more about the tribe’s 
strategy before the talks begin a 
week later. 

Barney is a hold-over Accom- 

GALAXY 




modationist who wants to see jonny 
Tack fail politically. He tricks 
FRANCO DART, an old man in 
Bono’s group, into revealing that 
Ecofreak has developed a new de- 
vice that inhibits nuclear reactions. 
Part of the device is a switch made 
of silcoplast (a cheap synthetic) 
welded to copper. Only Union can 
do the welding, which requires spe- 
cial facilities. Over some years 
Ecofreak could develop the welding 
technology, but Jonny Tack is im- 
patient and wants to get the sil-parts 
in a hurry. Later Barney tells Riv- 
era French enough to put Union on 
its guard. 

After delivering the news to Proc- 
tor at a late-night ball game, French 
is attacked on his way home by a 
group of “flames,” members of an 
upper-class cult led by SIDNEY 
UNSLER, the Unifier’s son and 
heir. French kills one of the flames 
during a chase and escapes. The 
episode brings home to French 
again that Sidney’s power is grow- 
ing as the Unifier’s faculties slowly 
fail. Sidney and his flames delight 
especially in ambushing and killing 
members of BTA. Sidney resents 
Proctor’s power and popularity. 

The traditional Opening Ball is 
held in Top Level, Unsler’s domain, 
the following evening. French is 
present with MIRI , his wife — an art- 
ist and a member of a women’s cult 
called Madonna. 

Regina Unsler, who has been 
watching developments both with 
practical interest and with nostalgic 
memories of her love affair with 
Tack, arrives at the ball with a plan 
to secure her own escape from 
Union. Her brother Sidney has 
oppressed her, and under the 

HELIUM 



tutelage of her spiritual advisor, 
SISTER SERENITA, she plans to 
escape to Hinterland. To do so 
she captivates Bono. Meanwhile 
she also snubs CLAFTO MEYER, 
a prominent flame and the man 
who, with others, attacked French 
the night before. 

Bono has spent a painful week 
trying to adjust to the powerful 
gravitron vibrations in Ricardo (he 
belongs to the five percent of 
tribesmen who find adjustment dif- 
ficult). During the week he has 
been plagued by a recurring mem- 
ory of his youth, hunting the man- 
sized Harvey hare, a mutant rabbit 
whose escape mechanism is a cloy- 
ing telepathic pulse of love. The 
hunter must overcome his affection 
to achieve a kill. 

On the morning of the ball, Bono 
finally experienced release from 
pain. Now he is giddy and dis- 
oriented and promptly falls for Re- 
gina. When she invites him to her 
domain he willingly complies — only 
to find her much less yielding in the 
privacy of her roof-top garden. Be- 
fore she can yield herself, she says, 
she must have a sign of Bono’s true 
affection. She demands that Bono 
request her as the Helium hostage of 
1056. Only after she has seen the 
news on Media that he has done so 
will she be his. 

Back at the ball, Clafto Meyer 
has recognized French from the 
night before. French and Miri flee 
from pursuing flames and manage 
to lose them, but only after another 
flame loses his life. They reach Top 
Level’s parking lot where Miri 
hides in a jump tube (one-man 
transport) while French goes 
exploring. He discovers that the 

89 




streets are blocked by flames. 

Proctor meanwhile, is overcome 
with rage while he impotently 
watches the flames pursue French 
and Miri from the ballroom. In an 
instant he conceives a plan of retali- 
ation against Sidney’s flames — 
“Operation Hairy Scary.’’ 

As negotiations begin the next 
morning, all parties are tense and 
exhausted. Proctor has spent the 
night organizing Hairy Scary. Bono 
has spent it in chaste conversation 
with Regina. 

French and Miri escaped the 
flames thanks to Barney’s 
intervention — he escorts them out 
of Top Level surrounded by tribal 
delegates and, since they are still 
followed, invites them into the em- 
bassy for the night. Franco Dart ob- 
jects to the invitation; to him, as an 
old Activist, French is the enemy. 
To appease the old man, Barney 
puts up the couple in an unused 
wing of the embassy. Relieved at 
their escape, the two make love, but 
only after Miri has completed her 
meditation. French watches her 
and thinks he observes a glow about 
her head and shoulders, a consequ- 
ence of her spiritual achievements 
as a member of the Madonna cult. 

Next morning French slips out of 
the embassy by a back way, leaving 
Miri to be collected later, with rein- 
forcements. The flames are still 
watching. 

During the negotiations, Bono 
asks for Regina as the Helium hos- 
tage, shocking both sides. Dart, 
fearful of what Tack might do, 
walks out (the approved hostage 
demand is for Sidney Unsler). Proc- 
tor sees his plot threatened. The 
talks stop as Union demands time to 

90 



assess its position. 

Later Proctor and French have a 
violent argument. In a last-ditch ef- 
fort to save his plot, Proctor wants 
to offer the tribe delivery of the sil- 
components if they withdraw the 
hostage demand and deliver a so- 
called “Interdiction.’’ French is 
sure the parts have military signifi- 
cance and are part of a series of 
shipments needed to develop a new 
technology. He harks back to 500 
lasers shipped five years ago against 
his advice. But Proctor is adamant. 

On the way out French learns 
that DARBY DICKENS, BTA’s 
security chief, will organize Miri’s 
rescue late that evening. 

French’s staff has guessed the sig- 
nificance of the silcoplast parts, but 
PROFESSOR FULBRIGHT, fore- 
most expert on the subject, 
angrily rejects the thesis. French 
leaves to let them argue it out. 

Later that afternoon Bono calls 
Regina. She is distraught, and 
wants him to come to her at once. 

That morning Regina had re- 
ceived a call from Sidney (who is 
laid up with a broken ankle). He 
is angry because she snubbed 
Clafto Meyer the night before, 
despite his orders to take Clafto 
as a lover (because Clafto is Sid- 
ney’s favorite). Clafto, he tells 
her, will come that night to claim 
her. Flames are guarding her doors 
to prevent her escape. 

While Bono is getting ready to 
leave, Dart bursts in with orders 
from Tack. Bono has been fired 
as chief of mission. Barney has 
been removed. Dart has assumed 
both positions. Bono is locked up. 

Clafto is having dinner to 
celebrate his upcoming possession 

GALAXY 




of Regina when word reaches him 
(hat Miri French has been expel- 
led from the embassy, has been 
caught, and is being held in a 
night club. He suspects a ruse and 
decides to pick her up after din- 
ner with a larger group of flames. 

Later that evening French waits 
in BTA’s stadium for the rescue 
learn to form. Preparations for 
Hairy Scary are being made, 
involving a large wooden chop- 
ping block and an axe-wielding 
man dressed to look like an 
executioner. The operation strikes 
French as crazy — as does every- 
thing at this moment, even Proc- 
tor’s plot, which depends on the 
creation of an artificial crisis 
through a Helium Interdiction 
which will start structure col- 
lapse. With the help of Media, 
Proctor hopes to take charge. 
French has no faith in the plot, 
hut now he doesn’t care. He has 
arranged for Miri’s safety with 
DACHSHUND JONES, leader of a 
“bottoms” gang. 

BTA’s forces ambush and gas 
Clafto Meyer and his comple- 
ment, and rescue Miri. French 
arrives at Ecofreak’s embassy at 
the same time and learns that 
Miri has been expelled by the new 
ambassador, Dart. Berserk with 
rage and fear he speeds away 
from his group bent on some mis- 
sion of his own. 

Meanwhile Proctor learns that 
the sil-components can be pro- 
duced in four days. 

He then dictates a letter to 
Ecofreak in which he hints that 
he is prepared to ship the silco- 
plast parts if only they will with- 
draw the hostage demand. 



In Texahoma the next morning 
Tack gets word of the letter. He 
prepares to move the Activist 
camp to the vicinity of Ricardo.

A DOUBLE TRACK 
OF DESOLATION 

Bono awoke to Regina’s low 
moaning. A bright ray of sun pierced 
in through a crack and illuminated the 
dark hayloft. Speckles of dust played 
in the light. 

He stirred, rose up to his knees 
brushing dry hay from his leather 
tunic and beard. He felt a strong 
unease about the brightness of the 
light — it was late. Could they move 
in daylight? Could she move at all? 

Regina lay next to him covered by 
two huge wire-bound bales of hay. He 
had placed them on top of her the night 
before as a substitute for the gravitron 
pressure her body demanded. He 
couldn’t well imagine that it helped 
much, but maybe the illusion did. 

He leaned over her and saw that she 
slept despite a constant movement of 
her head and flow of pained expres- 
sions across her face. He watched her, 
touched by the face. Somehow it 
seemed so different and ordinary in 
this new setting, in the gloamy light of 
this simple, wooden barn. Just a girl. 
Dark shadows beneath her eyes hinted 
at the trauma she’d undergone. It 
pained him to see it. 

Bono had not imagined his first 
night in Hinterland with her as it had 
turned out. The escape had come off 
smoothly. He’d knocked a hole into 
the drilla-glass wall of her garden 
roof, dressed in the parka and wearing 
the oxygen mask. She’d stood beside 



HELIUM 91 




him, also masked, resembling some 
kind of alien creature. Air rushed out 
through the ragged hole. He enlarged 
it, listening to the scream of a siren 
somewhere set off by his breaking of 
the structure seal. They passed out 
through the hole and then, sidejets 
blazing, put distance between them- 
selves and the tower. Minutes later, 
dropping quickly through the dark- 
ness, Bono turned and took in Ricardo 
with a glance, a random pattern of 
light. 

The unnatural exhilaration he 
felt, consequence of gravitron 
pressure-drop, should have told him 
that Regina would probably have an 
adverse reaction to the outside. But he 
didn’t discover just how badly she had 
been hit until they were nearly down 
and Regina ripped off her mask, 
turned to him , and gasped in a peculiar 
way. 

When they landed amid the loud 
abrasions of cricket legs, she stum- 
bled from her tube and tried to vomit, 
but nothing came out. He held her by 
the waist as she heaved. Later yet, 
many kilometers to the west, well 
beyond the Staging Station, which 
he’d skirted to the north, after they 
had found this lonesome barn, Regina 
had been in a state of great delirium, 
had suffered from frightful visions, 
had mumbled incoherently about se- 
renity, being buried, oracles, ecolo- 
gy, and much else. At last, while he’d 
sat next to her stroking her hair, she 
had dropped off to sleep. 

Now he reached out and gently 
stroked her hair again, arranged in 
braids like that of a tribal maid. He 
was careful not to wake her. She 
was. .just a girl. And in that realiza- 
tion, seeing her as she really was for 
the first time, without the distorting 

92 



structure setting, Bono knew that he 
loved her more than ever. 

How ridiculous to say that she was 
the Whore, that her seed couldn’t 
mingle with his. People were people. 
She came from the same pod he did — 
in some misty past. They were alike. 
Prejudice, he thought. Stupidity. For 
a moment he thought of Mycron 
Crestmore as a petty little man who’d 
fancied that God spoke through his 
petty little mouth. 

He moved from her and rose ginger- 
ly, recalling hard beams overhead. He 
had bumped into them during the 
night, arriving in total darkness, glad 
to have found a barn unguarded by 
loudly barking dogs. This barn was far 
from houses and people. They might 
be able to leave unobserved despite 
the advanced hour. If not, perhaps 
they could stay here until she passed 
through Adjustment. 

Bono went down the narrow ladder 
and out past rusty farm machinery to 
the small side door he had forced dur- 
ing the night. Outside the sun blazed 
high and bright. The barn sat in a 
valley whose rims were lined with 
pines. A dirt road snaked toward the 
barn. He hadn’t seen that in the dark- 
ness. Instead they had descended into 
the valley from over there, from his 
left, across that meadow. 

He glanced in that direction now, 
trying to establish the relative position 
of the barn, and he saw something that 
sent his heart into fierce throbbing. 
Across the meadow. ! 

The meadow was a mixture of sil- 
very mutagrass and green fodder 
scrub. A tiny waterway crossed it 
diagonally marked by lush, reedy 
vegetation on its banks and small 
trees, probably wild apple, at random 
intervals. From the direction they had 

GALAXY 




come, extending in a straight line right 
up to the apron of reddish dirt around 
the barn, he saw twin tracks of discol- 
oration in the meadow. The green 
scrub was brown; the mutagrass was 
curled and blue; at the spot where they 
had crossed the creek, the reedy 
bushes had collapsed and died. 

He ran to the edge of the apron and a 
few steps into the grass. He bent down 
and fingered the vegetation. The 
grass had died. Each track was two 
meters wide, more or less. Bands of 
desolation. .Desolation! 

In a state of excitement, Bono ran 
across the valley, in the spoor left by 
the jump tubes. He wondered how far 
the track extended. At this point they 
had been two or three meters above 
the ground. Earlier they had been 
higher. 

He ran, angry with himself. He 
should have guessed that, even with- 
out direct experience. She should 
have picked a course over rock, sand, 
dried-out stream beds. Or they should 
have travelled very high in the air. 

He hoped that they’d been high 
enough for most of the night. He had 
kept the tubes ten meters in the air 
except in spots where they had crossed 
over forests. Had that been enough? 
Well, he would soon know. 

From the top of the rise, standing 
between fragrant pines on slippery 
needle-covered forest floor, he looked 
down the way they’d come. As far as 
his eye could reach, he saw the twin 
tracks, considerably narrower out 
there where they had been higher up, 
but visible. His heart sank. From 
some spot outside Ricardo, their trail 
led here in twists and turns, broken 
here and there, thin now and again — 
but a track any pilot could easily fol- 
low from air ship or helicopter. 

HELIUM 



There was no time to lose. 

He turned and ran toward the red- 
ish, gabled bam as fast as his legs 
could carry him. 

Poor Regina, he thought. However 
she felt, she would have to get up now 
and move — on foot. High up in the air 
they would be seen and reported. Near 
the ground they would leave a track. 
Time was of the essence. 



LASERS 

The official levi-limo dropped 
down from the airspace and settled in 
front of BTA. 

Proctor gathered up his robes while 
the driver ran around to open the door. 
Then he climbed out and stood wait- 
ing for Gregory Kron. He had taken 
the Bureau’s lawyer along on this un- 
precedented visit to the Ecofreak em- 
bassy. Kron was also DA for Com- 
pliance and had supplied the technical 
language for the secret subagreement. 

Kron clambered out, his narrow 
face pinched and blue. Kron was aller- 
gic to artisun, hence his expression of 
perpetual gloom. Once in power, 
Proctor intended to give Kron a Top 
Level cubohome where he could ex- 
pose himself to natural sun through a 
drilla-glass roof. 

Together the men mounted the 
stairs and went inside. 

In thirty years of official life, Proc- 
tor had never experienced anything 
like this. At ten o’clock, Ecofreak had 
called. They asked for an immediate 
meeting about the letter Proctor had 
sent earlier in the morning. Proctor 
had suggested that he come to the em- 
bassy this time — a gesture of good 
will. He had set out with mixed feel- 
ings. And now, forty minutes later, 



93 




the subagreement was signed, sealed, 
and delivered. Kron carried it in a 
narrow attache case. The Interdiction 
could start within the hour. The 
negotiations had gone nerverackingly 
smoothly. 

At the elevator Proctor turned to 
Kron. “The moment we register the 
Interdiction, I want to be told. And 
alert Justin Todd at once. His pedple 
must be ready and in place. We must 
keep this absolutely secret, as pre- 
arranged.” 

Kron nodded and went off. His of- 
fices were on the first floor. 

Proctor entered the elevator and 
punched a button. 

So French had been right after all. 
These men were Activists. Dart had 
well-established Activist credentials. 
His sudden rise to power clinched it. 
Dart had accepted Proctor’s condi- 
tions without a murmur. He cared no- 
thing about the hostage demand, so 
much had been transparently obvious. 
He wanted only silco-parts. He hadn’t 
even questioned the demand for an 
Interdiction. He’d nodded his head 
impatiently, eager to put signatures on 
paper. Barney, Proctor reflected, 
would have understood the signifi- 
cance of that demand at once. He 
would have guessed that Proctor 
aimed for the supreme position. And 
once firmly in the saddle, he would be 
a very different force, very unlike 
Bernard Unsler. No more Accommo- 
dation then. But Barney had been ab- 
sent. And so had Bono — reportedly 
suffering from a bout of malaria. Fat 
chance. 

Proctor left the elevator and walked 
to his office. He knew that French had 
also been right about the oscillation 
control properties of the components. 
Which meant that they had to be made 

94 



inoperative in some way. And there 
was a problem. 

Earlier in the morning, Proctor had 
had an embarrassing discussion with 
Clemmens. Clemmens had evidently 
expected French to return, had ex- 
pected French to tell Proctor what 
Clemmens didn’t want to tell him — 
namely that the BTA technical staff 
was incompetent to defeat the Eco- 
freak device without some high- 
powered help. When French had been 
conspicuously absent, Clemmens had 
come to Proctor. 

Probing questions had revealed 
that Clemmens and Fulbright had had 
a huge spat the day before and that 
Fulbright was the only man even re- 
motely qualified to do the job. If Proc- 
tor wanted parts that didn’t work, he 
would have to negotiate a settlement 
between Clemmens and Fulbright. 
Always the negotiator. 

He stopped before Mrs. Sedlig’s 
desk. “Get me Carl Fulbright on the 
tel,” he said and walked into his of- 
fice. 

Moments later Mrs. Sedlig buzzed. 
Proctor leaned forward to activate his 
tel. Fulbright’ s goateed face appeared 
on the. screen. 

“Carl,” Proctor said. “Thank you 
for taking my call. I understand you 
are in the midst of a conference. I 
apologize.” 

Proctor always said this — 
everybody was always ‘in confer- 
ence.’ 

“I forgive you, Res. I suppose this 
is about the sil-components?” 

“Your are perceptive.” 

Fulbright made a deprecatory 
grimace. “Well, what pipe-dreams 
has your staff related to you? Do they 
still think it’s an oscillation control 
device?” 



GALAXY 




Proctor recalled Fulbright from his 
days in Defense and chose his words 
carefully. Fulbright was tiny, dried 
out, but he owned the world’s greatest 
ego. 

Proctor said: “The staff opinion is 
ludicrous, but I wanted to talk to you 
about this personally. I owe you that at 
least for your trouble. I’d also like to 
get your gut reaction to this. Not your 
technical judgement, Carl, your reac- 
tion as a citizen. Is it even remotely 
possible ? My staff might be limited, 
but they have good hunches some- 
times. If you were betting, giving 
odds, what would you say? What are 
the percentages?’’ 

The tone had been right. Ful- 
bright’s face relaxed. His features soft- 
ened. He thought about the question. 
Proctor recalled that Fulbright didn’t 
like snap answers, liked to ponder. 
Proctor watched as one of Fulbrigbt’s 
hands appeared on the screen to caress 
the goatee. 

“Well, Res, anything is possible, 
you know — speaking now not as a 
scientist with thirty years of polish in 
Vibration but as you suggest — as a 
citizen. But possible and probable are 
two different things. I don’t think it’s 
probable at all.” 

Proctor suppressed the urge to ask 
why. That would bring the wrong 
reaction. Instead he asked: 

“What conditions would you 
stipulate — as a man of science now — 
that would make such a breakthrough 
probable?” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” Fulbright 
said, thinking. He turned his head to 
one side and stared off into the dis- 
tance. “I’ve been toying with this and 
that since my session with Clemmens 
on your staff. .and it occurred to 
me that if you could concentrate 



gravitron vibration like you can con- 
centrate light. .if you could 
straighten out that helical geome- 
try. .” 

Fulbright looked back into the 
screen, raised his eyebrows, shrug- 
ged. 

Proctor felt reassured both by Ful- 
bright ’s answer and manner. No doubt 
Fulbright had rushed back to the draw- 
ing board, anxious to check out the 
situation. Proctor suspected that Ful- 
bright had been staring at formulae on 
a blackboard when Proctor called. 

He said: “If you were to test that 
theory, Carl, what would you do?” 
Fulbright gave a dry little snort. 
“Why, first of all I’d get myself a 
bunch of lasers and — ” 

“Lasers?” 

“Why, of course,” Fulbright said. 
“No need to re-invent the wheel. Not 
that the laser is a suitable device, but 
I’d start there.” 

Proctor said: “Carl, five years ago 
Ecofreak requested five hundred la- 
sers. We shipped them.” 

The little man stared out of the 
screen. “You don’t say?” 

“I do say,” Proctor rumbled. 
“Carl, we need your help. Desperate- 
ly. Could you, Clemmens, and I have 
lunch? The BTA executive dining 
room? Would you mind very much? 
We have some awfully tight dead- 
lines to meet. The matter is extremely 
sensitive, and I don’t want to discuss it 
over the tel. Could we meet? In half an 
hour? I’ll send a limo for you.” 
Fulbright nodded. “This puts a 
very different complexion on the 
thing, Res. Yes, I’ll be happy to join 
you. By the way, if your man Clem- 
mens had told me about the lasers 
. ...” He shook his head. “Until 
later, then.” 



HELIUM 



95 




The face disappeared. 

Proctor leaned back in his chair. He 
recalled the long, acrimonious debate 
with French five years back. If French 
ever returned alive, Proctor would 
compliment him on his insight. 

Not that French had much chance to 
receive that compliment, Proctor re- 
flected. Belmonte had been told of 
French’s exploit by Blottingham. 
French had gone off the deep end. His 
usefulness now lay entirely in the 
past. The laser insight had been one of 
his last signal achievements — 
disregarding the silco discovery, of 
course, which anybody might have 
guessed. Dart had been so obviously, 
so single-mindedly interested in 
them. 



THE AMBASSADOR 

Dart had chosen Barney’s prison 
personally. It was a windowless room 
in the very center of the embassy 
complex. Dart had assured himself 
from drawings that the room was not 
even near a service chasm. He had 
personally inspected the wall for 
soundness. Barney would not escape, 
like French had, like Bono had. 

Bono’s escape was not Dart’s fault. 
The staff had blundered. They should 
have told him that French had left the 
embassy by a back door, as it were, 
instead of through the front, as Dart 
had assumed. Tack couldn’t blame 
him for that. Not at all. In the wake 
of Bono’s escape, Dart had acted vig- 
orously. Men had been sent out to 
search the landscape beyond the Des- 
olation. Others had been dispatched 
to comb the chasm itself on the as- 
sumption that Bono had fallen to his 
death — a good likelihood. After all he 

96 



was a five-percenter. The pressure in 
the chasm was great. And it was easy 
to slip and fall in the darkness, on 
eroded walks. 

At the moment Dart hurried to have 
a look at Barney. He walked up the 
narrow stairs from the communica- 
tions room where he had transmitted 
the good news to Jonny. If it wasn’t 
for Barney’s troubling, haunting pres- 
ence, Dart would have thoroughly 
enjoyed Jonny’s exuberant congratu- 
lations. 

Twice in one day Jonny had 
praised him! First for the letter Un- 
ion had sent, essentially caving in 
on the silcoplast demand, the sec- 
ond for the subagreement itself, de- 
livered within hours of the letter. 
But Barney troubled him, took all 
the fun out of it. 

Dart stopped at the top of the stairs 
and waited until Dulsol had caught up. 
The man had a heavy, round head 
seated on a thick neck connected to a 
massive trunk. His arms were long 
and meaty. His legs filled the leather 
tunic to bursting. Short-cropped hair 
was a fashion in his district, Dallforth, 
something of an Activist stronghold. 
His red coloration was probably a sign 
of choleric temper. For these and 
other reasons — especially the cour- 
tesy Dulsol had shown him before he 
became Ambassador — Dart had ele- 
vated the man from his lowly post as 
Maintenance Chief to that of Provi- 
sional First Secretary. Dart needed an 
enforcer who could make the rest of 
the embassy staff do his will. 

Together they went down cor- 
ridors, turning several times, until 
Dart stopped before a peep-hole in a 
door. Dulsol had personally drilled 
the hole and had placed the glass be- 
fore Barney had been incarcerated. 

GALAXY 




Dart wiped his eyes and fitted it to the 
hole. 

At first he couldn’t see anything, 
but then his focus adjusted and he 
spied Barney on the floor. The man 
was writing, writing on the floor of the 
empty cubicle. 

Dart’s face wrinkled up in anger. 
Writing! What was Barney writing 
down? The hand moved rapidly over 
the scriptoplast. Now Barney looked 
up, thinking. Now he bent down again 
and scribbled on. How had Barney 
obtained the scripto, the stylus? 

Dart knew, knew what Barney was 
writing. It was an account of that din- 
ner in the House of Eighty-four 
Flavors. Barney composed a falsified 
report of that. Dart had certainly not 
betrayed the negotiating strategy. At 
most his tongue had stumbled over a 
phrase or two. But Barney would 
know how to exploit that, would try to 
disgrace Dart with Jonny — now! Now 
that Dart had made a name for himself 
at last. 

Who had helped Barney? Who’d 
slipped him the scriptoplast? Dart 
turned to Dulsol. “Who has keys to 
this room?” Dulsol said: “It’s an or- 
dinary lock. Anybody could get in.” 

“Come along, Dulsol. Let’s have a 
talk in my office.” 

He strode off, furious. 

In his office — recently Barney’s 
and still filled with his things — Dart 
glanced about with distaste at the giant 
Harvey pelt on the wall, the collection 
of mutant skulls hung on little wooden 
plaques, the holograms of Barney’s 
ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Pet- 
ra. He sat down in Barney’s huge 
leather chair, motioned to Dulsol to 
find himself a seat among the numer- 
ous hassocks. He peered down at his 
wrinkled hands laid on the shiny sur- 

HELIUM 



face of the desk. He looked up. 

“Dulsol,” he said, “as you know, 
Tack is coming north. He should have 
his camp set up by morning at the 
latest. I shall have to report to him, of 
course. I intend to leave tonight. 
While I am gone, you will be in 
charge. So far you have shown your- 
self an able, solid, loyal fellow. Now 
you’ll have a chance to show what you 
can do. I don’t expect you’ll have any 
trouble. Everything is under control. 

But I am leaving you one sort of 
messy item. I mean Barney, of 
course. Just now 1 saw him writing. I 
don’t know what he’s been putting 
down, and I don’t want to know. 
Probably some kind of seditionary 
message. Barney is a traitor. I have 
discovered that he had dinner with 
Rivera French the other night. He 
conspires with Union. As Jonny Tack 
told me yesterday on the cable, ‘Fran- 
co, old buddy, I don’t understand why 
Barney doesn’t have the decency to 
commit suicide.’ Or words to that ef- 
fect, Dulsol. ‘The man would be bet- 
ter off dead,’ he said. I certainly 
agree, although needless to say, 
we’ll probably have to go through 
with a long and dreary trial and all 
that. 

Of course, if he committed 
suicide, we’d be spared that little 
formality. I am worried about that, 
Dulsol. I’m also worried about his 
friend. If anybody can get into that 
room, somebody might try to let 
Barney escape. Under no cir- 
cumstances must he escape, do you 
understand?” 

“Do whatever you must. He must 
be prevented from communicating 
with Union. At all cost. All cost, Dul- 
sol. Is that understood?” 

Dulsol nodded again. 



97 




“Very well. I’ll be watching you, 
of course. If you do a good job, Dul- 
sol, I’ll put in a word for you. My 
recommendation should count for 
something now that I’ve pulled off the 
coup of the century. Well, that’s that. 
Leave me now, Dulsol. I have to pre- 
pare my report to Jonny Tack.” 
Dulsol rose and left. Dart came to 
his feet as soon as the door closed on 
Dulsol’s hulking form. He walked 
over to the Harvey pelt, grabbed the 
fine fur, and jerked. The pelt tore a 
little as it came off. Systematically, 
Dart began to remove Barney’s things 
from the wall. He tossed them into a 
heap in the center of the .room. Then 
he walked to the pile and trampled on 
it, stamped on it with both feet, until 
the pictures, mutant skulls, and 
wooden plaques were nothing but a 
rubble of glass, fiber, and bone. 



BLOTTINGHAM 

Blottingham sat in a genuine 
leather armchair at one end of a small 
gymnasium where Sidney worked out 
every afternoon with Roman sword 
and round shield to get his excercise. 
The weapons hung from the wall in 
racks together with horse-tail helmets 
modified with screened masks in 
front. Blottingham had chosen this 
place for his interrogation because it 
was the least private of Sidney’s 
rooms. He had no desire to trample 
about in the Fire’s domain. 

Circumstances had made. Blotting- 
ham both the Unifier’s and Sidney’s 
agent. Sidney’s disappearance and 
Meyer’s withdrawal had left a vacuum 
in the flame leadership. 

The ranks were decimated indeed. 
Proctor’s ploy had been effective. 

98 



Take Clafto. The man wouldn’t budge 
from his father’s palace, refused all 
calls. Fear was an effective 
weapon — but it could be used by any- 
one with a will. 

Blottingham had been interrogating 
Sidney’s bodyguard, servants, and 
those flames who’d spent the evening 
with the Fire. Despite persistent prob- 
ing, he had heard the same incredible 
story from all who had witnessed the 
event. 

A single man in a gas mask and 
armed with a chemgun had penetrated 
Sidney’s domain. Alone and unaided, 
he had laid low one and all with chem- 
gun blasts. His weapon had been 
turned to the maximum setting, and all 
those exposed to the gas had had an 
involuntary nap lasting between eight 
and twelve hours, depending on their 
metabolic rates. 

Yet another servant stepped in front 
of the leather chair. Blottingham 
knew that the man would add nothing 
new to the sorry tale. This one and no 
more. Blottingham intended to act. 

Listening to these witnesses, he had 
formed a theory in his mind. Proctor 
had staged that little theater with the 
flames as a diversionary excercise to 
mask Sidney’s abduction by one of his 
best agents — French. 

The boldness of the act made Blot- 
tingham wary in the extreme. If Proc- 
tor had dared this much, something 
very big might be brewing. Any direct 
action against Proctor could backfire 
miserably. Blottingham thought he 
knew a way to put pressure on Proctor 
and yet refrain from any overt conflict 
with the man. He had to be careful. 
What if Proctor acted in the name of 
other family members? They were 
known to be unhappy with Sidney. 

He turned to a close aide. “Car- 



GALAXY 




mody, fetch me a tel,” he ordered. 
Then he nodded to the waiting ser- 
vant. 

‘‘Where were you when all this 
happened?” 

The man was a butler or valet or 
table server. He didn’t have the proud 
soldierly bearing of the palace 
guard — nor was he humiliated by hav- 
ing been overcome. He worked his 
hands in front of his chest in some 
embarrassment. 

‘‘Yes, sir,” he began. “I was in the 
orgy room with the Master and stood 
by his head pouring wine from a flagon 
into his cup.” 

The man stopped short. 

“And? Go on, man.” 

“And then, sir, the door burst open 
and there was the man with a chemgun 
in his hand.” 

“What did he look like?” 
Blottingham was bored by this. 
Servants were stupid. He recalled the 
long and weary interrogation in Regi- 
na’s domain. All the servants there 
had sworn that a meteor had hit the 
tower, knocking a hole in Regina’s 
garden roof. A meteor! The people 
were superstitious. 

“I don’t recall seeing much of him, 
sir,” the butler said. “Being sur- 
prised, as you can guess. I sloshed 
some wine on the Master’s shoulder, 
and I was so troubled by that, wiping 
his shoulder with a napkin I always 
carry that — ” 

“Get to the point, man.” 

“Yes, sir. Then it got me.” 
“What got you?” 

“The gas, I guess.” 

“The gas got you.” 

“I suppose, sir. The next thing I 
know, one of your gentlemen was 
poking me awake, and I was laying 
there in a pool of dried wine.” 

HELIUM 



Blottingham wondered about that 
pool of dried wine and ran a hand 
over his short hair. 

“All right, you may go. But you 
didn’t see the man? You can’t de- 
scribe him?” 

The servant shrugged. “Just a man, 
sir. I can’t say as I saw much detail. 
He wore a grey jump suit with zippers 
in front and little zippers over the pock- 
ets. He wore a gas mask, but under- 
neath his chin was visible. He had a 
cleft in his chin. And he was blond.” 
Blottingham nodded. He waved the 
servant away. That man had been 
French, no doubt about it. He turned 
to Carmody who held the tel ready. 
Blottingham took the device on his lap 
and punched out the numbers for the 
garrison command. 

“Please give me Roger Belmonte 
again,” he said into the screen. “This 
is Blottingham from Top Level.” 
The formula always worked. He 
always got his man. Belmonte ap- 
peared in the screen, black face im- 
passive. 

‘‘Roger,” Blottingham said, 
“sorry to bother you so soon again, 
but the Unifier has just given me some 
new instructions. Meet me in front of 
the BTA with. .oh, two or three 
plain clothes detectives. The Old Man 
is very concerned about Proctor’s 
safety in light of the abductions. Can 
you meet me in. .twenty minutes, 
say? See you there.” 

He signed to Carmody and told the 
others to return to Top Level. Then he 
walked through Sidney’s domain to 
the front entrance where he climbed 
into a waiting levi-limo and told the 
driver to take them to Old Top in Cen- 
tralTower. After they were under way, 
Blottingham punched a button in his 
arm rest and a soundproof pane of 



99 




glass rose up to separate the two offi- 
cials from the driver. 

Blottingham explained his plan to 
Carmody, using his assistant as a 
sounding board. Under the guise of 
protecting him, Proctor would be con- 
fined to his cubohome. Blottingham 
intended to drop a strong hint that 
Proctor’s release was contingent on 
the production of Sidney and Regina. 

“That should work,” he told Car- 
mody, “unless, of course, Proctor is 
stronger than I think he is. Do you 
think there is something to the 
rumors? In light of what’s happened 
yesterday?” 

Carmody shook his head. “I just 
can’t believe that. The family might 
be restless, but Harvanth is solidly in 
the old man’s camp. We’ve got the 
army. Nothing can happen unless we 
lose the Army. If you want my guess, 
I think this had to do with French, not 
Proctor.” 

Blottingham brushed over his short 
red hair with a hand. Carmody was 
certain of the Army, but Blottingham 
wondered. Proctor and Harvanth 
would be a winning combination. 
Proctor was popular and Harvanth 
powerful. Harvanth had much to lose 
if Sidney took over; Sidney had visions 
of military conquest. Blottingham 
turned to Carmody. 

“Should we tell the Old Man? I’d 
hate to do it really. He’s been very 
unstable lately. God knows what he’d 
do.” 

Carmody agreed with a nod. “Why 
don’t we wait and see how Proctor 
reacts first. There is no sense in 
alarming the O.M. If Proctor re- 
sists, however. 

“You’re right,” Blottingham said 
without conviction. 

He knew in his guts that Unsler 

100 



should be told. But then, again, what 
if Harvanth and Proctor plotted to- 
gether? In that event Blottingham 
could easily end up on the losing side. 
He decided it was best to keep the 
situation fluid, the options open, at 
least for a while. 

The trip to Old Top took exactly 
twenty minutes, as Blottingham had 
guessed. Belmonte already waited be- 
fore the glass-fronted BTA entrance 
flanked by detectives. For once Bel- 
monte wore an ordinary blue robe 
rather than his ornate red uniform and 
feathered hat. Belmonte didn’t want 
to be conspicuous. 

They went in together. A BTA secu- 
rity guard acted unusually officious. 
He insisted on seeing everyone’s iden- 
tity card, even Belmonte’s, although 
the garrison commander was a well- 
known figure in Ricardo. Next he 
asked the gentlemen to fill in these 
here logs. Then he laboriously pre- 
pared and issued visitor’s passes to 
everyone. Only after all these prepara- 
tions did he call Proctor’s office on the 
tel to announce the guests. He had a 
long wait before Mrs. Sedlig came 
back on the screen and asked that the 
gentlemen come up. The guard then 
gave elaborate instructions on how to 
reach the Negotiator’s office, al- 
though Blottingham knew the way. 
Finally the guard released them. 

Halfway to the elevator, Blotting- 
ham took Belmonte by the sleeve, 
pulled him aside, and quickly 
explained the mission. 

Belmomte was a thick-lipped black 
with a stony face. He didn’t react to 
Blottingham’s account about the Un- 
ifier’s grave personal concern for 
Proctor’s safety. He merely stared. 

Blottingham stopped. “Can you 
handle that, Roger?” His tone be- 

GALAXY 




trayed a certain amount of exaspera- 
tion. 

Belmonte nodded gravely. 

In Proctor’s outer office, Mrs. Sed- 
lig asked the gentlemen to rest for a 
moment. The Negotiator was on the 
tel. He would see them the moment he 
was off. 

Blottingham sat down, feeling un- 
ease, and gave Carmody an oblique 
glance, but Carmody was staring at 
artificial bushes in large planters half 
masking a row of flag poles in golden 
stands: tribal colors. 

The patent tension in the room dis- 
turbed Blottingham. He glanced casu- 
ally at the morose detectives, at Bel- 
monte’s noncommittal face, at Mrs. 
Sedlig’s busy preoccupation with 
some sheets of scripto she pushed 
through a renewer. Some days ago 
this woman had conveyed a message 
from Proctor. Jump down a shaft! 

For the second or third time this 
day, Blottingham regretted that he had 
shouldered so much of the day-to-day 
burden of running Union since the Uni- 
fier’s last (and not much publicized) 
heart attack. 

In a rush to leave a record before 
death should claim him, Unsler had 
begun his memoirs during the re- 
cuperation period. That book had 
become his sole concern. 

Power had never weighed heavily 
on Blottingham. He had enjoyed its 
excercise. In a pinch Unsler had 
signed papers or, more rarely, had 
made a telcall or two to back up his 
chief of staffs decisions. But now 
Blottingham sensed a yawning empti- 
ness at his back. He wasn’t sure at all 
that the government could pull to- 
gether and defend itself against a 
strong attack. 

Unsler had been protected too long

from too many facts: Sidney’s intense 
unpopularity, the cabinet’s neglect of 
business, the insolence of officials 
like Proctor, the carping tone of 
Media. 

Blottingham was tempted to rise, 
leave, burst into Unsler’s study, inter- 
rupt all those literary labors, and say: 
“Mr. Unifier, I’ve botched it all up. 
Sidney has been abducted. Regina has 
disappeared, might have been kid- 
napped. The family has turned against 
Sidney. They hate me because I really 
run things. Harvanth and Proctor are 
probably plotting a revolution. Help 
me. 

No, no. It was inconceivable. Blot- 
tingham would have to tough this out. 
Another day or two at most. Besides, 
it was too late to leave. 

Proctor’s office door opened and 
out came three officials. One was 
balding, older; one had a blueish, 
pinched face; the third was black. 
Blottingham knew him from reports: 
Dickens, the security chief. 

Behind them came Proctor. He 
sported an uncharacteristic, beaming 
smile. His short, thick arms were ex- 
tended in greeting. 

“Paul,” he rumbled. “How very, 
very good to see you. Quite an honor, 
I must say.” He turned to Belmonte. 
“Roger! Are you with Paul, here? 
Gentlemen, do come in, come in.” 

Proctor ushered the people into his 
office, pointed at couches, armchairs. 
He rubbed his hands in seeming plea- 
sure, but his forced cordiality served 
only to deepen Blottingham’ s anx- 
ieties. Blottingham sat down and 
brushed his hand over the short hair on 
the top of his head. More than ever, he 
urged himself to be cautious. 

Proctor sat down, pleased with 
himself. In the last half hour or so, 

102 



immediately when Belmonte’s warn- 
ing call had cut short the lunch with 
Clemmens and Fulbright (but not be- 
fore they had reached an agreement), 
Proctor had made many rapid ar- 
rangements. 

He had reached every member of 
the Group, had briefed them all about 
the arrangement with Ecofreak, had 
designated Kron as the intermediary 
should Top Level move against him. 
The Helium pumping rate had begun 
to drop at noon. The Interdiction 
would be complete by evening. In 
four days, give or take a few hours, 
the change in power would be all set 
up. 

Now Proctor had only one worry. 
French. Blottingham had come to de- 
mand that Sidney and Regina be 
returned — wherever in hell French 
had them. If only French had kept his 
cool last night, and had not shot off 
on his own. 

“What can I do for you, Paul?” 

Blottingham said: “Res, Sidney 
and Regina Unsler have been ab- 
ducted.’ ’ He stopped and took in Proc- 
tor’s astonished expression. Did the 
man feign surprise? “Of course we 
are keeping it strictly under cover at 
the moment, but the Unifier has ex- 
pressed grave concern for the safety of 
all prominent men in Union. Espe- 
cially you. You are more popular than 
most. He has asked me to see person- 
ally to your safety.” 

“Are you serious, Paul? This is 
shocking news!” 

“Strange things have been happen- 
ing lately,” Blottingham said. He ran 
a hand over his hair. “A large number 
of prominent youth have been sexu- 
ally molested last night by gangs of 
men — ” 

“You don’t say,” Proctor cried. 

GALAXY 




Blottingham peered at him. Proctor 
was acting, shamelessly acting. 

“Yes. The Unifier doesn’t want 
anything like that to happen to you, 
Res. As I said, he has asked me to 
make sure that you are protected.” 
“What have you got in mind, Paul? 
A special guard? These gentlemen 
here. ?” Proctor gestured toward 
the dour detectives. 

“These gentlemen will escort you 
to your cubohome and will guard it 
against abductors,” Blottingham 
said. “We shall place a tap on your 
tel-line so that threatening calls may 
be traced at once. I know that this is 
inconvenient, but it should last less 
than a day. The moment Sidney and 
Regina are freed. .” 

Blottingham touched his hair and 
looked at Proctor and away again. 

“Until Sidney and Regina are 
found?” Proctor asked. 

“Precisely,” Blottingham an- 
swered. “The sooner they are freed, 
the sooner can we dispense with 
these precautions.” 

He looked up and met Proctor’s 
eyes, but Proctor didn’t hold the 
glance. He turned his head toward the 
desk, toward the large holograph of 
Unsler that hung above it. 

“I respect the Unifier’s wishes,” 
he said and rose. “Shall we go now? 
Or will you allow me to gather some 
scriptos?” 



VIII 

WAKENING IN BRANCO 

^Miri walked the streets of Branco 
with occasional glances back. Deep 
meditation in the aseptic BTA 
cubohome had brought forth the guid- 
ance she’d sought. In the afternoon 

HELIUM 



she had quietly slipped out of the 
building. Soon, wearing a new jump 
suit she had bought in a nearby arcade, 
she made her way to East Tower and 
down to Level 13. Her guidance had 
told her that Frenchy would be hiding 
in these domains of poverty, disease, 
and crime — back home, in territory he 
knew well. 

Noise raged all around her — the 
noise of squabbling women, of music 
loud beyond sufferance, of quarrels in 
alleys, of bargainers at stands. Branco 
lived in the streets. As far away as she 
could see — the Ring curved gently out 
of sight — stalls lined the sidewalks, 
big, small, covered, open, screaming 
in a thousand colorful signs and with 
the cracked voices of hawkers. 

She looked back again, troubled by 
a sense that someone followed her, 
but she saw no familiar face in the 
throng. People jostled and pushed. 
Teenagers ran past her yelling. Wild, 
unreflecting people. 

Odors bombarded her senses — the 
sweet smell of decaying garbage and 
food, of fecal matter, of air singed 
with ozone by escaping gravitron, of 
unwashed bodies and clothing worn 
too often without laundering. 

Maintenance stopped around Level 
30. In official eyes these people didn’t 
properly belong to Union. 

Yet how much more lively, racy, 
alive everything seemed. Just look at 
the walls, everywhere decorated by 
the strangely obscure paintings of the 
people. Initials, parts of words, 
numbers — they all glowed, radiated. 
On the street vendors sold fruits and 
vegetables — real fruit and 
vegetables — obviously obtained by il- 
legal barter with nearby tribes and 
smuggled into Ricardo through sub- 
terranean routes below the pit. 



103 




How, in this world, would she find 
Frenchy? 

Then, up ahead, she saw a familiar 
sign. The Scuttle-but, a coffee house 
where she’d met Frenchy years ago on 
an artistic expedition to sketch ‘bot- 
toms’ types. 

A linkage point. Unconsciously she 
had been drawn to this place, possibly 
the bridge between past and present. 
Here she might meet Frenchy again. 

She made for the place thinking of 
the Madonna who wove the psychic 
universe on her magic wheel. On 
Madonna’s spider web, the Scuttle- 
but was a tiny knot connecting two 
destinies — his and hers. 

A large place with many tiny tables, 
closely packed together, awash in the 
murmur of voices. Janeweed smoke 
rose in walls and hung in clouds about 
the place, its smell familiar to Miri 
from Cult sessions. 

She sat down against a wall and 
ordered coffee. It came, but she didn’t 
drink it. She listened to conversation 
on her left, watching the surface of her 
cup, the swirl of steam on the black 
liquid. 

A fuzzy-haired man spoke to 
another in a low, urgent monotone. 
He catalogued the sins of structure 
culture, predicted its imminent doom. 
A shitting jut, he said. Union was like 
a tired old man . It didn’t want to come 
up any more. You had to read porn to 
make it twitch. Education, art, reli- 
gion, science, exploration — all a shit- 
ting jut. Children floated in a vacuum. 
A shitting jut. His voice hissed on 
breathlessly. 

Familiar dirge. Miri had heard 
words like these years ago. The 
speaker’s aura touched her slightly. 
She sensed his deep alienation and 
moved herself slightly to the right, out 

104 



of his influence. As she did so, she 
looked up and saw a woman weaving 
her way between tables toward her. 

Miri immediately recognized the 
cool, poised movements of a Cult sis- 
ter. Thousands of hours of meditation, 
body and mind control, showed in the 
woman’s face; the woman didn’t look 
at Miri. She came in Miri’s direction 
in a brightly flowered sari. 

Passing the table, the woman slid 
an object toward Miri. It half rolled, 
half skidded toward her, silver and 
green. A ring. Miri picked it up with a 
quick glance toward the retreating, 
flowery back of the woman. She had 
been followed. 

Miri looked down at the ring, turn- 
ing it. The tarnished silver setting held 
an oblong, turqoise stone with 
black-white markings. For a second 
she stared at the pattern. Then she 
covered her face with her hands in an 
involuntary, abrupt motion. 

The pattern in the stone had un- 
locked memories suppressed by hyp- 
notic command, memories of meet- 
ings with Sister Serenita, the Cult 
Mother. The meetings extended over 
a period of seven years. Until this 
moment, Miri had not consciously 
realized that Serenita was the Cult 
Mother. Only the coven elders knew 
the identity of the Lady’s living rep- 
resentative on earth. Miri had also 
known it, but the knowledge had been 
kept from her conscious self. 

The flood of recall caused an in- 
voluntary shudder. Now Miri under- 
stood the significance of her blemish 
and what it meant to ‘have a role in 
history.’ Against the backdrop of her 
memories, the events of the last few 
days suddenly seemed fraught with 
meaning. She sorted the memories in 
her mind. 



GALAXY 




Seven years ago, at the annual con- 
sultation of the Sybilline books, the 
fall of the oracodice had given Verse 
39, Great Change. This fact had been 
kept from the Cult membership, be- 
cause Verse 39 signified a momentous 
change in human consciousness, a 
dramatic transformation in culture. 
Each verse had nine lines. Three of the 
lines had been accented and therefore 
contributed to the meaning of the ora- 
cle. The first line had said: ‘Eco- 
sphere: flowers in the meadow. ’ The 
second one had said: ‘A queen con- 
fuses the Male.’ And the third: ‘The 
blemished artist leads the remnant.’ 

A search through the ranks of the 
Cult had identified Miri as the 
blemished artist — she was a mi- 
cromosaiker and had a birthspot on her 
cheek. At the time she was a novice 
engaged in the acquisition of the most 
rudimentary of arts. The Cult Mother 
called for her, to look at her, to see if 
the oracle might have meant Miri 
rather than someone else. Satisfied for 
the moment, the Mother sent her on 
her way. From time to time thereafter, 
other meetings had been held to see 
how Miri progressed. Each meeting 
concluded with the hypnotic com- 
mand of forgetfulness, given under 
the influence of this ring — Serenita’s 
own ring, worn on the finger of Saturn 
on the nun’s left hand. She had been 
commanded to forget; only full adepts 
could know the inner mysteries, the 
Lady’s visible representative. 

There had been a meeting — she re- 
called now the relief she had experi- 
enced then — when the Cult Mother 
had concluded that Miri couldn’t be 
the ‘blemished artist.’ She had just 
married Frenchy. He had entered the 
service academy, but he was neverthe- 
less still very much a smuggler from 

HELIUM 



Branco. In numerous other consulta- 
tions of the oracle, the Cult had 
learned that the ‘blemished artist’ 
would marry a figure capable of de- 
laying or impeding the Great 
Change, a figure of importance, 
prominence. Frenchy gave no such 
promise at the time, and no one 
bothered to ask the books about 
him. Later, when Frenchy rose with 
meteoric speed through the ranks of 
BTA, Serenita changed her mind, 
and Miri’s sessions resumed. 

Recalling this, Miri shuddered 
again. She didn’t want to be one of the 
so-called ‘queens of the change.’ She 
didn’t want a ‘role in history.’ 

What did it mean, Great Change? 

Serenita said that the ways of the 
Male would yield to the way of the 
Lady. Great Change was a time of 
rejoicing. The oracle had spoken of 
the Ecosphere, of flowers in the 
meadow, of a healing. Change, 
Serenita insisted, was in the minds 
and hearts of people. But Miri had 
always understood that verse in more 
cataclysmic terms. As an adept she 
had been permitted to study the an- 
cient texts, and commentaries on the 
Change never failed to make the point 
that Verse 39 meant an ending, an 
upheaval, a disaster. If the blemished 
artist ‘lead a remnant,’ the clear im- 
plication was that some would re- 
main. But what about the others? 
Would they be recycled, one and all, 
into the cosmic soul vats, to be born 
again into another age? 

Miri didn’t want to live through 
anything like that. What would it 
mean? The fall of the structures? 

She had posed that question to 
Serenita as well, getting evasive re- 
plies. Structure or Hinterland — it 
didn’t matter. The ways of the Male 



105 




dominated both worlds. They would 
be swept away by a change in con- 
sciousness. That might or might not 
mean the end of structures. Structures 
didn’t matter. They were merely 
shells. 

Another question that had plagued 
Miri — and once more plagued her 
now that she remembered it all — was 
how. How would she lead a remnant? 
What remnant? From where to where? 

Serenita’s words still rang in her 
ear: “Miri, you think like the Male 
thinks. Causes, effects, motives. The 
Lady works by indirection. If you’re 
the person chosen to do her will, 
you’ll be led in the right paths. At the 
right moment, you’ll know what to 
do.” 

‘‘And the queen who confuses the 
Male? Who is she?” 

‘‘That’s not something you need to 
know.” 

Miri dropped the hands from her 
face. Her coffee was a dark, deep 
shining in front of her. The steam had 
disappeared from its surface. She 
pushed the cup aside and looked at the 
ring again. It was clearly Serenita’s 
ring, the only one she wore on her pale 
hand. In the concluding hypnotic 
sequence of her meetings with the 
Mother-, she had stared at the ring with 
utmost concentration. She recognized 
every detail. Now she held the ring. It 
meant that Serenita had reached a final 
conclusion — Miri was the person sig- 
nified by the Sybilline books. It also 
meant that the time was nigh. The 
secret had been unlocked so that Miri 
could act with knowledge. And final- 
ly, disturbingly, it meant — or Miri 
sensed that it meant — that Serenita 
had passed on to her, to Miri, the 
symbol of her authority. 

My God! Miri thought. That means 

106 



1 am a full adept. It means l must be 
pregnant. For to achieve the knowl- 
edge of completion, a woman had to 
have the final experience of woman- 
hood, birth or, at the least, concep- 
tion. 

She shuddered again, throwing off 
psychic tension, and became aware of 
her surroundings. Next to her the 
fuzzy-haired man still hissed in a 
monotone. Doomed, finished, a shit- 
ting jut. The end, kaputt, knock- 
out. 

Miri rose hastily and ran out of the 
Scuttle-but. She wanted to get out of 
here, away, far away. She didn’t like 
her inner feelings. She had to dissipate 
her anxieties in motion. She had to 
find her Frenchy, sanity, something 
familiar, something to hold on to. 

After a while she calmed herself. 
The throng of people, the noise, the 
colors reassured her. The shadowy 
memories slowly settled down as part 
of her conscious awareness. Whatever 
happened, life would go on. The Lady 
wove fate. From her fingers issued the 
pulse of existence. Not Miri’s place to 
question cosmic forces. Only the 
Male pretended to rule over the 
world. .a microbe on the skin of the 
legendary elephant. Whatever will be, 
will be. 

She passed a clump of people from 
whose center a young boy’s voice rose 
up with the scripto-vendors hawking 
cry. 

‘‘Getcher, getcher, getcher scrips. 
Getcher scrips and read abooot his 
Finkoo’s kiddienap las nayte. 
Getcher, getcher, getcher scrips, 
Flame’s been snufood aeught.” 

It was the most distilled form of 
Branco dialect. 

Caught by the urgency of the 
voice, whose broadcaster Miri 



GALAXY 




couldn’t see — the clump was a whirl- 
ing of hands and arms from which 
people broke away reading 
intently — she joined in, penetrated the 
clump, pressed a coin in a dirty urchin 
hand, and came away with a small, 
thin scrip. 

She nearly stopped in her tracks 
when she read the bold headline 
across the front page of the thing. 

SIDNEY KIDNAPPED BY BTA 
BIG. 

She stopped to read the story. All 
around her people were doing the 
same, and there was a buzz of excited 
talk. People ran off; others came. In 
minutes the newsboy had sold out his 
supply. 

The story itself was brief and factu- 
al. But much of the rest of the paper 
carried speculation about the meaning 
of the unusual event. 

The story described how Rivera 
French, well known to the people of 
Branco, had penetrated Top Level 
North last night. He had immobilized 
the palace guard by chemgun and had 
abducted Sidney Unsler. His where- 
abouts were unknown. Sources within 
the Unsler household were cited as 
authority for the dramatic disclosure. 

The speculation went far beyond 
that bare account. They identified 
Frenchy as a man close to Reston 
Proctor. They linked the mysterious 
round-up of flames the night before to 
the abduction. They saw this move as 
the opening sally of the much rumored 
revolution — 

Revolution? 

Miri sucked in her breath. Blood 
pounded in her throat. For a moment 
she became oblivious of the scene 
around her, which began to clear 
rapidly of people. They ran, they dis- 
appeared into buildings. She read with 

HELIUM 



total amazement, aware for the first 
time of Frenchy’s probable involve- 
ment in some kind of surreptitious 
political movement. 

So she, Miri, had already been as- 
sociated unknowingly with Change 
— be it great or small. Her hus- 
band a conspirator? It seemed that he 
was. 

Frenchy, oh, Frenchy ! she 
thought, overwhelmed in a delayed 
reaction by a crazy fear for her 
man. Abductor, revolutionary? 

She bent over the scrip again, 
searching for additional clues. 

She stood reading when a small 
man grabbed her by the elbow. 

“Lady,” he said — it came out 
‘leuydy’ — “Can’t yer see the 
squeezoos? Ya better getcher rumpies 
uffa da belt, heay? Reading a scrips 
now, leuydy! Open yer eyes.” 

Miri opened her eyes and looked 
about. Far behind her on the movebelt 
she saw the blue of police uniforms. 
The man hustled her along toward a 
door. She followed him meekly. They 
entered into the close, fetid atmos- 
phere of a bar. Young men on stools 
and around tables looked up in unison 
as the two entered. 

“An ufflevel chips I picks up read- 
ing the scrips in front of the 
squeezoos?” a young man nearest to 
Miri asked. He had come erect on his 
stool. His tone was alert. 

“Where you at?” the little man 
asked. “Don’t yer read?” 

He waved his own copy of the 
scrips at the young man. 

“Frenchy stole the Finkoo las 
nayte; they’s searching toyteen.” 

“Our Frenchy?” 

“The same.” 

Young men crowded about them. 
Miri eyed them. These total strangers 



107 




discussed her Frenchy in tones as if 
they were on the most intimate footing 
with him. They broke into exclama- 
tions now crowding together over the 
articles the small man had spread out 
on the bar. One of their number read 
aloud. Miri gathered that only a few 
could read. Then they conferred. 
They concluded that Frenchy must be 
hiding in Branco, they listed possible 
hiding places only the Kayring would 
know about. 

She watched them with apprehen- 
sion and hope comingled — young 
men in hand-embroidered jump suits 
of various colors, some with faces 
pockmarked by gravitron blisters, 
some bearded like tribesmen, dark, 
light, black, white, chinoise. Beyond 
the group over the bar a slow-moving 
colormixer wove patterns on the glass 
screen. Drink spigots gleamed with 
curving necks. The stout bartender 
wiped a glass at the far end. 

“Ya’ve yapped sufficient,” the 
small man said. “Naw clear it it uff, 
clear it uff. Squeezoos will be busting 
in heay. Move uff naw.” 

‘‘What abooot the chips?” 

Eyes focused on Miri. 

‘‘What abooot yer?” the small man 
asked. ‘ ‘ Whatcher doing in Branco?’ ’ 
Miri swallowed. “I’m Miri 
French,” she said. ‘‘I’m looking for 
my husband.” 

Eyes searched her face, some with 
narrowed suspicion, some with an ex- 
pression of pleasure. Then one man 
said: “It’s er. I seen a pitch. That 
mark on er, see?” 

Involuntarily Miri reached up to 
touch the birthmark on her cheek. 
Heads began to move up and down. 

“Cum oon, then,” the small man 
said. “Uff with yer and er, uff to 
Dachsy. Dachsy must be toold.” 

108 



In a body the men made for the back 
of the bar. Miri moved in their center. 



A PROMISE SATISFIED 

Up ahead regina saw the dark line 
of pines across the ridge, against the 
lighter darkness of the star-spangled 
sky. They made for the broken 
silhouette of some sort of ruined build- 
ing up a steep, slippery gradient 
amidst a rustle of leaves. 

She sobbed in My cal’s wake, sob- 
bed with fatigue. And then she sud- 
denly stopped because It stopped. She 
realized with a joyous feeling that she 
was herself again. But the feeling was 
more than that. She felt incredibly 
well, giddy with a kind of joy. 

She cried: “Mycal, Mycal!” 

Bono stopped and turned around, 
alerted by the change in her tone. 
Could she be over it? He put his hands 
beside her cheeks and tried to see her 
eyes in the darkness. 

“Yes,” she said. “It’s over. I’mall 
right again.” 

He whispered: “Thank God, thank 
God.” 

“Mycal, it feels so wonder- 
ful. .1. .1 want to sing or some- 
thing. Do you know what I mean? Did 
you. ?” 

“Yes,” he said, remembering the 
feeling. He had felt the same way on 
the morning of the ball and recalled 
that sense of miraculous healing, the 
loss of trauma. 

Regina felt light and clean. Despite 
a very arduous day of hiking and the 
physical weariness she felt in arms, 
legs, and back, she was refreshed and 
rested as if she’d just awakened after 
hours of sleep. 

“Hungry?” he asked her. 

GALAXY 




“Ravenous,” she cried. 

“Come on, then. Let’s go up to that 
hut. We’ll hide there and rest for a 
spell — provided it isn’t occupied by a 
bear. Then we’ll head out again after a 
bit.” 

He felt thankful for her recovery but 
anxious about that trail of gravitron. It 
haunted him, it made him want to 
move on, ever farther. He would let 
her sleep for an hour or two. Then 
they’d strike out again toward the dry 
bed of the old Ohio. 

Inside the building they unloaded 
the clumsy packs he had fashioned out 
of oxygen-canister straps. He in- 
spected the place by the light of a torch 
and saw silver-gray wood of ancient 
vintage, the inside of some sort of 
park structure. He cleared an area of 
brush and leaves and handed her the 
torch. 

“Open some cans,” he said. “I’ll 
try to find us some water.” 

Regina sat for a moment savoring 
the pleasure of being off her feet, the 
musty odor of vegetation, so differ- 
ent, so much more pungent than in 
her roof-top garden. At the same time 
she continued to feel giddy release. 
She ached with pleasure — and longed 
for pleasure. She was hungry and tired 
and lively all rolled into one. It was 
stimulation, she realized, nothing 
more. Nevertheless. Her body 
had been shrivelled up under the as- 
sault of pain. Now her cells expanded 
all together and broke into a chorus of 
gladness. 

She set to work unpacking blankets 
from the packs, finding canned food. 

She thought: Wonderful, wonder- 
ful. I’m in Hinterland. I’m feathering 
our little nest. 

She didn’t think about the implica- 
tions of her internal words, feeling as 



close to Mycal as it was possible to 
feel. She recalled his anxious minis- 
trations the night before when she had 
lain under that huge bale of hay sob- 
bing with terror. He was so sweet and 
kind to her. She was his and he was 
hers. Very fateful. 

In the bottom of the pack, groping 
in the light thrown by the hand torch, 
she found golden spoons with the Un- 
sler flower set into the handle in relief. 
She arranged the spoons next to the 
cans, removed the can lids. Mycal had 
insisted on taking only protein mush. 
The smell would have made her turn 
off under ordinary circumstances, but 
now she was so hungry, she took a 
nibble from the can. The taste was 
delicious. 

This done, she unzipped her jump 
suit and climbed out of it — a girl in 
panties and a white blouse. Involun- 
tarily she ran her hands over her nip- 
ples, belly, and down the insides of 
her thighs. She trembled with an unac- 
customed surge of desire, surprised by 
it. She inferred its cause as the read- 
justment of her body and a consequent 
euphoria; nevertheless, her mind 
swam with visions of copulation for a 
second before she controlled herself. 

I hope I don’t smell too bad, she 
mused. She had had no chance to 
bathe, nor any inclination. But her 
deodorant was a secret formula that 
released odor controllers long after 
application. Her hygienist had in- 
vented the cream expressly for her. 

Outside Bono sniffed the air, 
searching for water. He knew the 
smell of a spring or brook. He 
hadn’t been in the Acropolis long 
enough to lose his senses. He 
moved on. After a while he sensed 
a deeper moistness in the air and 
soon found a trickle of water at the 



HELIUM 



109 




bottom of a rock face. Moist fingers 
touched his tongue testing for pollu- 
tion, but the spring seemed pure. 
He collected water in the bottle and 
went back to the building on the 
ridge. 

When he entered the hut, he saw 
Regina on the floor draped in a blan- 
ket. In the dim light of the torch which 
she had propped up so that its beam 
fell on the roof and reflected from the 
silvery redwood, he saw her eyes 
gleam. Yet there was a dull look on 
her face. She sprang up and ran to- 
ward him . She wore only panties and a 
blouse. She embraced and kissed him 
while her midriff pressed into his in an 
unmistakeable way. 

For a second he experienced an- 
noyance. Now that he was anxious, 
Regina was amorous. But his an- 
noyance dissolved in passion. Tonight 
there was nothing to impede his grop- 
ing hand. 

Their stumbling movement toward 
the blankets on the floor upset the 
propped-up torch and it went out. 
They made love in total darkness. 

Bono rolled on his back, tired, a 
little sleepy, a little sad. The moment 
had come and fled too quickly. Her 
body had tasted much like those 
bodies on the other side of the refinery 
in Wellhead. 

By his side Regina stirred restless- 
ly. The brief, clumsy encounter had 
left her stimulated but dissatisfied. 
She was sure she hadn’t con- 
ceived — Conceived? She kept having 
that stray thought when in fact 
she meant something else. He had left 
her hanging. He had neither the ex- 
perience nor the sophistication to 
match her appetite. She hesitated for a 
while, but then, impelled by hungry 
euphoria, she engaged his attention 

110 



with tiny kisses on neck and chest and 
gently exploring fingers. 

For Bono the ensuing time of 
sexual experience was like a mad 
dream of flesh, a wild tumbling and 
floating, a stormy trip through plea- 
sure gardens by comparison with 
which the Wellhead nights seemed a 
stumbling through a sickly cabbage 
patch. She appeared to him a 
Whore of Whores whose indecen- 
cies were made the more outrageous 
by a seeming innocence. Someone 
so frail and sweet had powers of 
endurance and an angry, growling, 
purring, biting passion he had never 
thought possible in a girl. She 
groaned and cried in orgasmic cul- 
minations. The sound went out of 
the little hut once, and then later 
again, and then later — when Bono 
had thought that the last pleasure 
had been drained from their trembl- 
ing, sweating bodies — yet once 
more. And then she fell asleep as 
soundly as a baby, leaving him 
bruised and cross-eyed, holding her 
and breathing her perfume as it 
seemingly steamed up from her 
flesh in the cool, moist, mountain 
air. 

Ten minutes, Bono told himself. 

An owl hooted mournfully, and 
yet it was a glad sound. They lay in 
an environment where animals thick- 
ened the ecosphere again. 

Ten minutes, then he would wake 
her and they’d move on again. They 
had to move. 

Ten minutes, ten fingers, ten com- 
mandments, tents, tentacles of creep- 
ing sleep, of mountain fog, of owl 
hoots falling from the pines. 

CAESAR’S ABORTED 
INITIATION 



GALAXY 




French was out there, far out, on 
the edge of sanity. 

He ran down the narrow walk of the 
service chasm in the light of gravitron 
sparks. Sidney’s heavy body went 
bump, bump on his shoulder with ev- 
ery step, and Sidney’s right foot, en- 
cased in a heavy cast, hit French 
rythmically on the buttock. 

The life of action, it went through 
his mind. The life of action, he huffed. 
Adventure, he huffed. Danger, 
Tests. Challenge. Battle. 

French often suspected that he was 
crazy. Now and then he knew he was. 

Why did a man choose a life that 
had such episodes in it? Times when 
all reasoning, deliberation, wonder, 
and examination were banished and a 
whole life hung on the instincts that 
guided feet over an eroded, dusty, 
treacherous path. 

French had become one with his 
physical processes — the burning in 
his lungs and the pain in his limbs and 
shoulder where Sidney, chemmed 
again when the police had ap- 
proached, now pressed down heavy 
and limp. Meanwhile French’s brain 
drifted off like an uncaged beast into 
mischiefs of fantasy. 

He exulted over visions of death. 

He saw himself stumble forward, 
hit by bullets from behind. Cut loose 
from his grasp, Sidney fell against the 
flimsy railing beside the path and 
careened down silently, not aware 
enough to scream. The vision lacked 
drama, and French imagined other 
deaths in quick succession — a death- 
fall through a shaft, holding his victim 
in an eternal embrace; death in the 
crush of a collapsing level; death in 
the radiation belt where he had once or 
twice thought of taking his prisoner; 
death at the hands of a maddened mob 



intent on lynching Sidney but mixing 
their identities. 

Death appeared sweet and inviting. 
French had lost his will to live al- 
though his body and brain disagreed 
and used his habits and training to 
keep on surviving anyway, just for 
the sheer damn hell of it. 

French let it be. 

He didn’t mind living a little 
longer. He would pick his own style of 
death. He’d die with a bang, an explo- 
sion, a flash. The world would know 
that he had sacrificed himself to save 
his honor. 

These thoughts arose from a dull 
conviction that Miri had died at the 
hand of the flames. French fancied he 
sensed her absence telepathically. 
When the police had found his hiding 
place— something he would never 
have thought possible — he’d seen 
that as an omen, a sign. 

Gasping wildly, he stopped and 
turned. Sidney’s cast-heavy foot hit a 
wall. 

It seemed to French that he had 
gained on his pursuers. He had left 
them behind around the turn. For a 
second he listened, holding his breath. 
He heard gravitron pulsing, a kind of 
silence. But then he could distinguish 
the far-off rustling of steps. 

They were still coming and they 
had no need to hurry. With every step 
French had left behind a clearly visi- 
ble trail in the plastosteel dust of the 
walkway. It would appear sharply out- 
lined in the blaze of their torches. 

He caught his breath, chest heav- 
ing. 

Momentarily he wondered — still 
half in fantasy — if he should go on 
like this, burdened by Sidney. What if 
he just dropped the vile flesh-sack into 
the chasm? Union would owe him an 



HELIUM 



111 




eternal debt. Then, free of this heavy 
Other, he could swiftly escape his 
pursuers and wander through Ricardo, 
a dangerous seeker after Miri; a ven- 
geful seeker, alone, unimpeded, slip- 
ping from disguise to disguise; a 
hunter after the ultimate prize of life, 
the love of Another; a stalker after 
those who’d done her harm; a gar- 
dener with a scythe in hand; a reaper 
of chaff. 

Or should he, instead, do what he 
had determined to do in saner 
moments — use Sidney as the hostage 
to force her release? But what if it was 
too late? Still, there might be 
hope. 

But he couldn’t stand here any 
longer, gasping. He turned and ran 
on. Sidney Unsler went bump, 
bump, bump on his shoulder; the 
cast spurred him forward with 
blows on his rump. 

The whole mad, undeliberated 
sequence of events went by in his 
mind as he ran — the violent entry into 
Top Level North, the furtive trip 
through Ricardo guiding what seemed 
an empty jump tube alongside his 
own, the choice of a hiding place — an 
excellent, secret spot only a few 
members of the Kayring gang could 
know about (and yet the police had 
found the spot nevertheless, a poor 
omen!), the wait, the proposition and 
Sidney’s unbelief, troubled sleep, 
discovery, and now his flight. 

The pattern was one of madness and 
disorientation conceived by a man 
stupified by anxiety and grief. The life 
of action fell to pieces without a little 
bit of thought. 

French had chosen as his hiding 
place an ancient crane-operator’s 
booth made of silcoplast (silcoplast, 
alas!) to resist gravitron and left up 

112 



inadventently after construction of 
East Tower’s southern quadrant. Over 
the years the booth had been sur- 
rounded and obscured by other con- 
structs. It was totally private. French 
knew about it only because some boys 
he had run with had found it on for- 
bidden explorations of the service 
chasm. 

He dumped Sidney on the floor of 
that booth toward early morning. The 
Fire sprawled out, unconscious, still 
under the spell of chemgun gas ad- 
ministered to him as he had dined. 
French sat down beside him. He set up 
a small visi-recording device he’d ta- 
ken from Sidney’s domain. Then he 
waited and waited and waited for Sid- 
ney to sleep off the effect of a full- 
force chemblast. As he waited, resist- 
ing the urge to fall asleep, French spun 
schemes of extortion and escape. 

He didn’t plan, exactly. He ran af- 
ter feverish imaginings. The time of 
planning was behind him. He had 
broken with his past. Sidney’s abduc- 
tion would almost certainly derail the 
Secret Agenda. And even if the Rev- 
olution went forward successfully, 
Proctor would no longer want him on 
his team, not after this. But the Secret 
Agenda couldn’t succeed. How would 
Proctor get an Interdiction unless he 
gave up the silco-parts? And what if 
he did? 

It must have been nine or ten in the 
morning when French started up from 
a doze. Sidney had begun to stir. He 
came awake, his long face uncom- 
prehending and disoriented, his eyes 
blinking in the beam of French’s 
torchlight. 

A face of dissolution and arro- 
gance: a long face with thick, sensu- 
ous lips, red even in the harsh bright- 
ness of the torch. The lips contained 

GALAXY 




Sidney’s total character. They were 
mobile and changed shape with his 
thoughts, while his eyes were cold, 
malignant, and fixed in a stare. 

His voice husky after long silence, 
French explained the situation to the 
celebrated Ignis. Sidney didn’t under- 
stand him immediately, and French 
had to repeat himself several times. 

At last Sidney’s lips curled con- 
temptuously, and he laughed without 
much humor. 

“1 understand, I understand. This is 
a practical joke, eh, Tanti? That’s 
you, Tanti, isn’t it? Your make-up and 
wig don’t fool me. Well, I see through 
it. Is this an initiation Did you boys 
decide to test the mettle of your 
Caesar? You will find me tough and 
unyielding in the test. How can the 
Fire be burned, my dear Tanti?” 

‘‘I am Rivera French, as I said, 
lately an official of BTA. You really 
are my prisoner, Unsler, and I mean to 
get my way.” French pointed his 
torch at the small visi-recorder set up 
next to one of the jump tubes. ‘ ‘I want 
you to tape a message to your friends. 
Here’s what you say.” 

Again Sidney laughed. “Slowly, 
Tanti. Your Caesar can’t be made to 
yield. He is a man of courage. Vir 
fortitudo. I’ll say nothing, nothing at 
all.” 

French Stepped in front of Sidney 
who sat on the floor leaning against 
the wire-backed silcoplast booth. 

“Snap out of it, Unsler. This isn’t 
any kind of game your pals have 
thought up. This is for real.” 

Sidney guffawed, and in exaspera- 
tion French hit him across that sneer- 
ing mouth with the back of his hand. 

A bitter thought flashed. There is 
no reality. There are only games. His 
game is as real as mine. 



But French wanted Sidney to play 
French’s game. 

The Underunifier wiped blood from 
the corner of his mouth. His expres- 
sion had hardened, but French hadn’t 
got through to the man. The cold eyes 
stared. The red lips worked. 

“You can’t fool me,” Sidney said 
after a moment. “You’re Tanti, no 
matter how you disguise your voice. 
Caesar can’t be broken, not by a slap, 
not by anything. I have passed 
through greater crises. I am a spirit 
with many bodies. I hover over entire 
ages. I am Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, 
Tsetung, Phandi, and Pugilista. My 
hands have gestured and trillions have 
moved to do my bidding. Go ahead, 
Tanti, hit me again. I can stand initia- 
tion. And I will be generous with you, 
after the ordeal. You and I, we shall be 
brothers. You’ll be my godfather, 
my initiator, the witness of my for- 
titude. ...” 

Sidney went on. In the midst of this 
French turned away from him and 
looked around for a suitable gag. He 
found an old towel, soiled and torn. 
He himself might have used it for 
some purpose as a boy. The cloth 
dusted with age. He gagged Sidney 
and then tied his arms behind his back . 
Finally, he placed the man head first 
into one of the jump tubes. 

Sidney struggled for a while, his 
legs extending beyond the tube’s rim, 
one foot in a cast. Then his motions 
subsided. 

French sat down. 

He decided to give Sidney an hour 
in the tube. That would sufficiently 
soften the man. French had his doubts 
about Caesar’s courage in a real situa- 
tion of acute discomfort. 

Then, exhausted beyond measure, 
and lulled by the song of gravitron. 



HELIUM 



113 




French fell asleep despite his best in- 
tentions. 

He awoke to a furious metallic 
noise. Someone approaching the sil- 
coplast booth had stumbled across the 
trip wire French had rigged during the 
night and had caused a pyramid of 
empty lubrican drums to fall. 

Blood beat in French’s throat. He 
ran to the tube and hauled Sidney out. 
The long face was gorged with an ac- 
cumulation of blood. Sidney’s eyes 
were dull with pain or terror. The dirty 
gag obscured his expressive lips. 
French had slept long. He felt the 
pulse of restored energies. Therefore 
Sidney must have been confined for 
hours. 

French checked his chemgun. He 
pulled the gas mask over his head and 
pressed the trigger, releasing the last 
of the gas left in the ammunition car- 
tridge. Sidney slumped and French 
threw the gun aside. He ripped the gag 
from Sidney’s mouth, placed the body 
on his shoulder, and climbed out of 
the booth by way of a manhole and 
rickety stairs. 

Above he heard the police bang 
on the door. When they entered, 
chemgas would incapacitate them 
for a while. 

Sidney went bump, bump, bump on 
his shoulder. 

Where to go now? What to do? 
French pondered. 

In his hasty flight, French had left 
behind the visi-recorder. The police 
had found his hiding place. He had 
lost his base of operations. 

He would go down, he decided, 
down into the abandoned tunnels of 
the ancient undercrust. 

The police wouldn’t search for him 
down there. The tunnels were not well 
known except to gangs operating 

114 



smuggling rings. And if they followed 
him, he could easily elude them. 

He would think about next steps 
once he was safe. 

French stopped again, unable to 
continue at this pace with such a load. 
Now, far behind him, he saw the jerky 
motion of torches and several run- 
ning figures. 

Somewhere up ahead there had to 
be a stairway or slide bar that would 
allow him to descend. 

He gave himself a moment of 
breathing time, watching the lights 
jerk in the hands of his pursuers as 
they ran. Then he turned to con- 
tinue and saw with shock another 
group of men coming toward him, 
very close, from the other side. 
They must have entered the service 
chasm seconds before through a 
door. 

French stepped to the railing, and 
when the men drew up before him, 
their torches a blinding wall of light, 
French cried: 

“Not another step, people, or Sid- 
ney Unsler goes right down the 
chasm.” 

Loud laughter answered his com- 
mand. The voice said in the thick 
Branco brogue: “Go ahead, Mr. 
French; dump the bastard. We don’t 
give a shit.” 

A short figyre detached itself from 
the lights and came toward him, 
backlighted and therefore obscure. 
Nevertheless, French recognized 
Dachshund Jones and saw that the 
man smiled. 

“Dachsy!” 

“The same,” Dachsy answered, 
grinning. “Before you say anything 
else, sir, let me tell you this. Miri 
is safe. 

She’s with us.” 



GALAXY 




GANG COUNCIL 

Young men from the Kayring gang 
had arranged empty crates ap- 
proximating an oval in a well-lighted 
area of the murky warehouse. The 
councilors sat around the circle and 
listened to Frenchy with troubled ex- 
pressions but with a forward-leaning 
concentration as great as Miri’s own. 

His words mesmerized her for sev- 
eral reasons. First, she’d lived with 
Ihis man skin-to-skin, as it were. She 
was an accomplished psychic. Yet 
she’d never suspected that he had plot- 
ted revolution. Second, what he said 
slowly filled in an empty matrix in her 
mind, cell by cell, and she gained an 
insight into the crude mechanics that 
underlay the Great Change. Finally, 
she realized that Frenchy had made a 
momentous decision in the last several 
days? hours? He had decided to cut the 
cord that bound him to BTA and up- 
striving ambition. He told these 
people — they were total strangers to 
her but to him members of his larger 
family in Branco days. .they ap- 
preciated him, considered him a hero, 
and Dachsy Jones’ introduction had 
been warmly admiring — he revealed 
to these people the entire intricate 
schematic underlying something he 
called the Secret Agenda. But to what 
end did he say all this? What conclu- 
sion would he reach? Why had he 
pleaded with Dachsy to call the coun- 
cil? 

Half her mind retraced the im- 
mediate past seeking clues, lingering 
over the glorious reunion, the tears 
. .the hungry, cramped, repeated 
embraces. .the long and tender 
looks they had exchanged, so happy to 
be together again. But after a while 
Frenchy had sobered. A look of dis- 

HELIUM 



traction had come over him. He had 
excused himself to find a tel. 

Outside police were searching ev- 
ery centimeter of Level 13. They had 
already rummaged through the 
warehouses and had sealed all the 
doors. The gang had known to enter 
here without disturbing the seals. 
Nevertheless Frenchy had gone off on 
tiptoe. She watched him talking on the 
tel in a brightly lit supervisor’s booth 
in the center of the warehouse, sur- 
rounded by small yellow forklift 
trucks parked in orderly rows before 
ceiling-high, gleaming stacks of red- 
dish plastosteel rolls. 

He had come back to her after a 
while, his face darker even than it had 
been when she’d first seen him, even 
more weary and fatigued. 

“It’s no use,” he sighed. “Proctor 
has gone mad. I checked with Clem- 
mens who wouldn’t talk but who gave 
me enough of a hint so I can piece it all 
together. I reached Proctor in his 
cubohome. The man seems to be un- 
der house arrest but not a bit bothered 
by that. I asked him to level, but he 
lied to me.” 

He stared at her, through her. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking 
about,” she said. 

He glanced at her, as if awakening, 
said: “Of course you don’t, girl. But 
you’ll hear it all soon enough. Now 
what I need is your help. Stick with 
me, baby. For me, at least, there is no 
place but out.” 

Miri looked across at Frenchy with 
an emotion of affection. She’d stick 
with him, through thick and thin. She 
loved him, after all. Wherever he 
went, she went. 

Across the circle French sensed 
Miri’s emotion. He addressed much 
of what he said to her. His eyes swept 



115 




the faces of the councilors, many of 
whom he’d known well as a boy. But 
his glance returned to Miri’s face. Her 
eyes gleamed with a strange kind of 
brightness. She sat leaning forward, 
lips slightly parted, hands folded in 
her lap, very still. She wore a green 
ring he didn’t recognize. 

He went on inexorably and step by 
step recounting the history of the past 
few years. He knew himself a traitor, 
revealing secrets not his to reveal. Or 
was he, perhaps, merely an uncon- 
scious agent of the Kayring gang sent 
out years ago by a pulse of collective 
will to secure gang-survival now? 

He felt no real guilt doing what he 
did. His heart belonged to Branco, 
always had. 

The cells of Miri’s matrix slowly 
filled in, and at one point she began to 
experience the wild flash of insights. 
From the matrix — a pattern. From the 
pattern — a forecast of events to come. 

This was a story of two parts, she 
realized, and Frenchy only knew half 
of it. But someone knew the other 
half, and that would be. .Regina! 
Miri wondered if Regina really knew 
her role. Or was she also, like Miri 
herself until hours ago, a willing but 
unconscious agent of Madonna’s 
spinning hand? 

And had she, Miri, also played into 
the hands of fate? If she had listened to 
Frenchy ’s pleadings and stayed away 
from the ball — would there have been 
an Operation Hairy-Scary then? She 
wouldn’t have been in the embassy 
and French wouldn’t have gone 
berserk. He would still be up there 
arguing for sanity with Proctor. 
Didn’t the oracle say that she would 
marry a man who could delay, pre- 
vent the Change — if permitted? Had 
she, unknowingly, derailed the ra- 

116 



tional unfolding of events? Would 
Regina confuse the Male in turn? 
Winch male? Bono? How? 

Her excitement increased. 

She marvelled. 

Her Lady of Indirection. The subtle 
Female’s dark, healing work. ... In 
Cult lore they likened Madonna to the 
long-legged stork picking puffed-up, 
croaking frogs from a rotting log with 
a sharp beak. She was the docile cow 
dispensing milk with her watery eyes 
staring stupidly into the green, her 
jaws working slowly on the cud. Or 
yet again they likened her to a carry 
bird shamelessly feeding on the dead. 
Or yet again to the phoenix who 
burned in consuming psychic fire, 
who fell down in ashes that fertilized. 
She was the cunning snake and meek 
dove of Jesus Christ. Somewhere she 
had seen Madonna with a hundred 
arms, festooned with skulls, and also 
as the Ocean Maid dispensing 
nourishment. 

Nature red in tooth and claw. Na- 
ture green with bud and seed. 

Slow and subtle. Cunning and indi- 
rect. 

She insinuated herself into the 
cracks of the Male’s concrete. She 
abided and waited for the coincidence 
of events. 

And at the end she prevailed. 

She could be yoked, but not en- 
slaved. She was a whore you never 
used, a sea you couldn’t drain, a song 
you couldn’t break by singing, a time 
you couldn’t hold in your hand. 

Around Miri the warehouse with 
pyramids of plastosteel coils, straight 
corridors, neat yellow forklift trucks, 
the blaze of lumiglobes set in a 
girdered ceiling seemed like a 
mausoleum, the geometricities of 
logic. While in her now burned an 

GALAXY 




intuition, like the Phoenix herself, of a 
world burgeoning in utter silence. The 
Lady was Helium, and if she refused 
to flow, there would be stillness. 

Then Miri heard French winding 
up. He predicted structure collapse at 
worst, great turmoil and destruction at 
the least . He called upon the council to 
reach a great decision. He asked them 
to leave Ricardo using the ancient 
tunnels of the undercrust for a new life 
in Hinterland. 

The words nearly paralyzed her. 
Not she, he would lead the remnant. 
Something had been amiss in the ora- 
cle. 

French sat down and looked at the 
faces in the circle. The council stirred 
uneasily, frightened by the proposal, 
embarrassed, perhaps, that he had 
made it. French might be the ‘best 
loved son’ of the Kayring gang, as 
Dachsy had said, but for that reason, 
also, he was an outsider. 

French sought support in Miri’s 
eyes, but she was still away in some 
contemplation of her own. 
Yet. .how oddly her face shone! 
Could she be meditating in the midst 
of this company? Was that brightness 
the nimbus he sometimes saw about 
her head and shoulders? Could others 
see it too? 

There were nine councilors and 
Dachsy now turned to Number Two 
and asked for comment. 

The man rose, cleared his throat. 
“Dachsy, I don’t know. These are 
strange times. The Fink lies over there 
unconscious.” His hand gestured to- 
ward a group of young men against a 
wall. “Frenchy tells us we should 
abandon our turf, but I don’t know. 
We worked eight years to reach one 
ton of vegetables a month, and in two 
years we’re up to ten tons, and we’re 



all rich now. I just can’t see us aban- 
doning the routes just like that. On the 
other hand, there’s the Fink, and who 
am I to argue with Frenchy. I don’t 
know, Dachsy. I just don’t know.” 
Dachshund turned to an ancient, 
shrivelled man. “Phil?” 

The ancient rose. “I’ve been on the 
council forty-five years and twenty as 
your Number Three, the gravitron 
having spared me. Dachsy, you tell 
me I hark back too much, and I guess I 
do. I remember when we were four 
small clans and I went out there to 
catch cricks for a living back in the 
days when up-level folk thought that 
crick pincers kept them from going 
sterile. When that went flat we hunted 
rat for a while, in the chasm, and we 
sold rat meat pretending it was 
mutachick. Then we won the apple 
route, and I was there, Dachsy, that 
night we outbid the Ayring at the 
Peacefreak village they used to have 
east of what’s now the Staging Sta- 
tion, and I broke my ankle in the fight 
on the way home that night when the 
Ay-cats fell on us just after you went 
down into the narrow part of the 
oceanside foundation break BTA 
closed in ’22. Most of you younger 
ones don’t even know that route. And 
slowly we expanded, Dachsy. I saw 
us grow. At first it was ten clans, and 
then it was fifteen. We grew and we 
gained turf, humble and deferential 
like. And then we started using mus- 
cle, and now we have the ring as ours 
and going beyond.” 

The old man paused, as if to stop, 
but he merely caught his breath. 

“If you think those times were 
peaceful, you’re wrong. I was kid in 
’98 when mercury in a wellbreak 
poisoned the anaerobics and the tanks 
were down for eighteen weeks. A

million starved then, and all of them 
below Level 20. Oh, I can name them 
all for you — repair riots in 1002, wall 
break in Branco when I started in 
school, the electrostorm of 1008 when 
the power failed although the grav- 
drums held and people went berserk 
and ran like mad sheep and fell into 
the shafts. And the Helium War of 
101 1 . 1 remember that like it was yes- 
terday. People said the world would 
end, but it blew over. ...” 

The old man went on reminiscing 
for a long time. Finally he sat down, 
and Dachsy called on the others, one 
by one. French could sense the mood 
shifting. They rose and sat down in 
turn, one after the other, echoing the 
old man, discounting the dangers, 
stressing the positive of the current 
situation. 

Gyrations toward inertia, French 
thought, recalling a hundred similar 
meetings, scores of committees, 
working groups. 

His heart sank as he listened, all 
too aware of the dynamics. 

The last man finished his speech at 
last, and now all eyes turned to Dach- 
sy. In that moment, French glimpsed 
motion. Miri had come to her feet. He 
started at her appearance. The faint 
glow he’d seen about her head had 
intensified. 

God! The girl radiated as if she 
were on fire. Her eyes were brilliant, 
and she drew the attention to herself, 
away from Dachsy. 

She stood with hands extended, her 
face entranced. French saw awe in 
councilors’ faces. They stared at her 
with parted lips. 

Slowly Miri looked around. Then, 
in a voice oddly vibrant, she said: 
“Listen to me, people. There is a 
prophesy. ...”

It was dawn. 

With a small retinue, Tack returned 
from the pine-covered ridge just 
above the temporary campsite next to 
the barn where Bono’s jump tubes had 
been found, charred heaps of metal 
and burned gear. From there, the night 
before, Fannin had set out with a 
group of men and hounds to hunt 
down the traitor. No word had come 
during the night, and this morning 
Tack had combined his meditation 
with a bit of looking out toward the 
west, but in the deep mists he had seen 
no sign of Fannin nor had he heard the 
yelp of dogs. 

The meditation had gone well this 
time, and Tack experienced a stir of 
pleasure heightened now by what he 
saw below. A copter had just landed. 
Its blades still turned, churning dust. 
He made toward it down a slippery 
slope. That could be his harem, at last. 
The moment Ricardo fell, the moment 
he knew the Plan had succeeded, he 
would plunge into a great festival of 
love to dissolve the Pact of Chastity. 

He had been right! Through settling 
dust ferns jumped from the aircraft, 
unsupported breasts deliciously 
a-bobbing. Tack abruptly changed 
his course and headed for his own 
tent. He didn’t dare talk to the fem- 
mies. The temptation might be too 
great. Tack wouldn’t endanger his 
great achievement now by a false step 
that might anger Him-Up-There. 

Despite these resolutions, Tack sat 
down to breakfast woefully aware of 
his many weeks of deprivation. It was 
worst when he was rested and full of 
energy. His mind played tricks. The 
soft-boiled eggs, the grass-seed gruel, 
the thick molasses he mixed into it, 

GALAXY 




the pink of Harvey ham, and even the 
rolls he broke to smear with honey 
reminded him of fem-flesh. It was as 
if his harem sent out vibes. Come to 
think of it, a couple of the girls were 
mutants, and they did emit a rut-smell 
quite strong and compelling once a 
month. Henrietta. ... As soon as 
Ricardo crumbled, he’d scoop out 
Henrietta like he scooped out this egg, 
but he wouldn’t use a spoon to do so, 
by God. 

To some extent he felt relieved 
when Robartus announced Dart’s ar- 
rival and Dart came into the tent. Tack 
asked for a second table setting. His 
eyes gleamed mischievously. He 
would tease the old skunk a bit. Dur- 
ing the night Barney had committed 
suicide back in Ricardo. 

Chewing mightily, leaning back in 
his chair, Tack wagged a finger at 
Dart, chided him. Couldn’t stand to 
have rivals around, could he, the sly 
little ferret. 

Dart opened his eyes wide, raised 
his hands in surprise, and asked what 
Jonny meant. Dart was dusty from his 
long ride through the night. His eyes 
were reddened from fatigue. 

Tack laughed uproariously. He 
leaned even farther back in his chair 
and reached out for a cable on a table 
at his back. 

“Listen to this, Franco,” he said, 
looking at the cable. “It comes from 
your deputy, Dulsol. ‘Barney com- 
mitted suicide, 0300, 7/7/1056, as per 
instructions.’ It’s addressed to you 
personally, my friend, but we read it 
anyway. That’s good — ‘per your in- 
structions.’ ” Tack chuckled. “I’ll 
keep my eyes on you, Franco,” he 
cried, gesturing with the cable. 
“You’re a sly one, you are. Deep but 
sly.”

At these words Dart went white in 
the face. He heard an echo of Barney’s 
words from Tack’s mouth. He stared 
in fright at Tack’s face, half expecting 
to encounter Barney’s eyes. During 
that eerie ride in the night, he’d had 
hallucinations. He turned to the side 
seeing motion. Not a ghost. Robartus 
had entered and announced that Fan- 
nin was on the radio. 

“Come on, Franco,’’ Tack cried, 
jumping up, “let’s see what our 
Teddy has found.’’ 

In the com tent Fannin reported 
over the crackling frequency. 

He had them. He had them both. 
Them ? Tack asked. Yes, sir. Bono 
and Regina. “We came upon them in 
a ruined hut,’’ Fannin augmented. 
“They were fast asleep. Naked. I’ll 
let you guess what they’d been doing. 
All worn out, the pair. Now we need 
to get some transportation back. I’m 
not about to trek all day after treking 
all night.’’ 

Dart observed a transformation in 
Jonny’s features. Tack had been in a 
funning mood. Now he’d turned 
purple — a deep purple the more ac- 
centuated because Jonny had a light 
complexion and blond hair. Tack 
screwed up his face into a grimace 
whose character Dart couldn’t 
decipher — some sort of mix between 
pain and pleasure and anger and a kind 
of nasty joy. Tack’s voice was choked 
when he replied. Transportation 
would be sent. Tack signalled a man 
and told him to get the coordinates and 
to dispatch a ship. Then he turned 
abruptly and walked off, leaving Dart 
to stand by himself. 

Back in his tent, Tack sat down 
again before the breakfast table and 
stared at the food for a second. Then 
he raised a boot and kicked the table 

120 



with such force that the flimsy porta- 
ble affair buckled under the impact 
spilling its contents all over the tent. 

“ROBARTUS!” Tack bellowed. 

His manservant appeared at the tent 
flap; he knew his master well and 
stayed out of kicking range. 

“Clean up this goddamned mess, 
God dammit! But do it quietly. I have 
to think.” 

The servant whisked and crawled 
about as quietly as a mouse, keeping 
close to the edge of the tent, while 
Tack sat in his chair. He laid his face 
into his hands and remained some 
time in the attitude of a thinker. 

Tack thought about vengeance. His 
blood beat at his throat and in his tem- 
ples. His breath came very hot. 
Nevertheless, his reasoning powers 
functioned perfectly. He argued with 
himself about the Pact of Chastity. 

In strict constructionist terms, mu- 
tants and structure dwellers were not 
really people but actually a kind of 
lesser breed. Right? Right. When a 
man said fem-folk, he meant tribal 
girls, tribal ferns. Right? Absolutely 
right. Therefore Regina Unsler 
couldn’t be said to be a femmy, not by 
a strict construction of the meaning of 
the term. Right — right precisely be- 
cause book nine, chapter seven, verse 
twenty-eight forbade all intercourse 
with the Whore, and in the greater 
context of book nine, the reasoning 
was clear: they weren’t people! Verse 
forteen also forbade all striving with 
beasts. Right, right! But what about 
verse twenty-eight? Wouldn’t that be 
a violation. ? No, Tack decided. 
Verse twenty-eight applied only when 
a man sought structure flesh for itself, 
for the pleasure of it. Tack didn’t 
propose that. Not at all. He proposed 
to visit vengeance on Bono, and Re- 

GALAXY 




gina Unsler was merely a tool, merely 
an instrument to carry that out. There- 
fore Tack would violate neither the 
Pact nor the Crestmore if he went 
ahead with his plan. 

“Robartus! Where in the hell are 
you?” 

“Here, sir.” Robartus stuck his 
head through the flap. 

“I want a tape recorder.” 

“A tape recorder?” 

“Yes, dammit. Your ears dirty or 
something? A tape recorder. Move.” 
The servant disappeared and Tack 
stood up. He stretched and yawned. 
His good humor had returned again. 



THE SECOND QUEEN 

The copter flew high over pine- 
covered ridges. It was a spacious craft 
with rows of seats in the cabin-facing 
the pilot, two on one side and one on 
the other, a small aisle between them. 
Regina sat in one of the single seats 
staring rigidly down at thick white 
mists in valleys, with here and there a 
tree-top visible faintly in the mist. 

She didn’t want to look inside, still 
humiliated by the capture. She 
couldn’t help the feeling that she was 
as much a prisoner as Mycal. The 
shame of that awakening! She had 
opened her eyes and had stared up at a 
man bent down over her naked form 
with a corner of the blanket in his 
hand. The hounds hadindecently sniff- 
ed her rear. And then had come a 
certain amount of harsh verbiage. The 
tribesmen had watched her dress with 
strange looks in their eyes. They had 
separated her from Mycal, and later, 
when the craft had arrived, she had 
been hustled into the copter very 
roughly. 



She could hear the hounds. They 
had been loaded into the ship and 
cowered between seats on the other 
side, their tongues extended, their 
lean, rib-marked bodies heaving. 
Near them sat some of the men, and 
she could feel their observing eyes. 

For the first time since setting foot 
in Hinterland, Regina experienced 
with clear consciousness an intuition, 
premonition she’d had moments after 
landing in the darkness outside Ricar- 
do. 

It had hit her then, an odd sort of 
awareness that her life would soon 
undergo a radical change, a great 
change. 

Under the tortures of Adjustment 
pressure, she hadn’t thought about it. 
Nor, later, during that glorious night 
of striving, which had dissolved in 
sleep. 

But now she felt it very strongly — 
and it was more than just the usual 
culture shock any structure-dweller 
might have on the outside. It 
was. .she couldn’t put her finger on 
it. A feeling, a forgetfulness? Great 
change, she thought; the words kept 
echoing. 

Perhaps it’s simply that I’m in love. 

She no longer tried to conceal it 
from herself. From the start she had 
loved Mycal, perhaps as far back as 
the ball, certainly after their long night 
of chaste conversation. She had tried 
to tell herself it wasn’t so, still think- 
ing of Jonny, who had been so very 
different. But now she knew she’d 
found the man for her future. 

She turned her head despite the star- 
ing tribesmen and looked tenderly to- 
ward the archangel. 

He sat up front, apart from the 
others, next to the leader of the group 
that had hunted and found them. 



HELIUM 



121 




From the facial expressions and be- 
haviour of the men, Regina inferred 
that the leader was prying and her 
lover uncommunicative. Mycal sat 
with a morose expression, occasion- 
ally nodding, answering in curt 
phrases. The other man spoke with 
rapid gestures of his hand. 

She was determined to save Mycal, 
confident that she could do it. During 
their long cross-country trek, he had 
told her enough about Jonny so that 
she understood why Mycal was fear- 
ful. But she also relied on her own 
powers of persuasion. Jonny owed her 
a favor — for old time’s sake. 

A change in the pitch of the blades 
signalled the start of descent. The cop- 
ter began to drop, and Regina felt the 
surge in the stomach so familiar to 
jump tube users. It signified ‘down.’ 

She pressed her nose against the 
pane again. Trees rushed by on one 
side. Red clay ground blurred. Then 
she saw a circle of tents with an odd 
metal construct in the center, a kind of 
tower supporting machinery on a plat- 
form. A loaf-shaped device reminded 
her of a miniature grav-drum. The 
coper dropped toward a large circle of 
flattened mutagrass. The clouds of 
dust rose in greeting and obscured the 
view. 

Nudged by tribesmen, she went 
forward, following Mycal. As she 
picked her way down the narrow met- 
al stairs, eyes on her lover — he was 
being led away toward the. .yes! It 
was the barn where they’d spent a 
night — men ran toward the copter 
with bent backs as they passed be- 
neath the still whirling blades. One of 
them grabbed her roughly. 

“Just a minute,” she cried, “let go 
of me!” 

“Shut your yap, fem-stuff,” the 

122 



man growled. “Out here you’re no- 
body, understand? Nobody.” 

They moved her at forced quickstep 
toward the camp. She looked ahead, 
saw an ornate complex of tents con- 
nected by low, covered walkways. 
The ecology flag flapped from the 
highest peaks. The hands on her arm 
were hard, relentless. 

The men led her into the complex 
and stopped in a kind of outer room. A 
man seated on a canvas chair in the 
attitude of a guard rose and went 
through a flap into an inner chamber. 
He reappeared and gestured. Her cap- 
tors led her to the flap and shoved her 
through. 

Regina caught herself and looked 
up. 

She looked at the back of a man, the 
back of a head adorned with a horse- 
tail of hair. He stood next to a bed, 
cover pulled back to reveal a triangle 
of white. A tray with a bottle of wine 
and two glasses stood on a stand. The 
man turned and moved toward her 
with an odd expression on his face. 

“Jonny Tack!” she cried, breath- 
less with astonishment. 

Regina’s surprise was not oc- 
casioned by seeing Tack, whom she 
had recognized easily from the back. 
She was caught off guard by an inter- 
nal shock of such force that she 
clutched her head and bent double as if 
hit by a sudden attack of migraine. 

Great Change! Great Change! 

Memories assaulted her, a shock of 
surprise. She was a member of the 
Madonna Cult going back many 
years — yet she’d been made to forget 
it. 

Tack’s face had released the hyp- 
notically held memories. She had 
been commanded to forget until she 
faced him again — and now she 

GALAXY 




realized in a flash that nothing, noth- 
ing in the last few weeks had been 
pure chance — not her meeting with 
Mycal, not her longing to escape to 
Hinterland, no, not even her ravenous 
sexual hunger last night. 

All this had been predicted, vague- 
ly at first, then in greater and greater 
detail as Serenita had sought more and 
more information from the oracles, 
the crystal, visions. 

Regina knew herself a full adept 
now — which meant that she was preg- 
nant, with Mycal’s child. 

But, shockingly enough, she also 
knew what her role would be — to con- 
fuse the Male, to shatter his powers of 
judgement, so that an era could end at 
last, so that the last remnant of a dead 
age could be buried. 

Jonny’s intentions were revealed by 
the bed and its pulled-back cover, the 
wine, the glasses. But she no longer 
loved him, she loved another. 

Do 1 want to do that? Do I want to 
do it? 

Who was shel Was she flighty, ir- 
responsible Regina, the play girl , 
forever concerned with the excellence 
of her articles of consumption and 
use? Or was she that other Regina — 
the one schooled in all the psychic 
arts? 

She realized that she was both — 
that the many long conversations 
she’d had with Serenita, several each 
week, forgotten but now remembered 
as clearly as anything else, were her 
conversations. That she believed in 
the oracles and knew that she would 
do what had been predicted, would 
have to do them, one way or another, 
voluntarily or by force. Not she con- 
fused the Male — he confused himself. 
She was but the Lady’s instrument. 

More than ever she hoped against 

HELIUM 



hope that Mycal would understand 
and forgive — if he, if she, survived 
the Great Change which stood im- 
mediately before them. 

Her odd motion had stopped Tack 
in his tracks, his eyes puzzled as he 
stared at her bent-over form. She 
forced herself to smile as she looked 
up again. Many years of secret prac- 
tice had taught her how to command 
body and emotions. Now she knew 
how to do it once more. Imperceptibly 
she took a deep breath and exhaled it, 
slowly gathering energies from the 
ether. Slowly her smile turned sala- 
cious and her lips curled, her cheeks 
dimpled. “Jonny-boy,” she warbled. 
“Fancy meeting you here.” She held 
out her arms as he came toward her, a 
glazed expression in his eyes. He was 
the Male, stupid and destructive, but 
ultimately in her power. 



IX 

THE CONSORT 

French pulled in the reins of his 
pony and the horse came to a stop. He 
nudged the animal forward. In no time 
his mount walked half submerged in 
water, groping toward the other side 
of this depression filled with water 
seepage. 

French let the animal find its own 
way. Lumiglobes strapped to his arms 
gave more the illusion than the reality 
of light. The tunnel was very wide at 
this point, its ancient walls caved in, 
and darkness reached out hungrily for 
the faint gleam of his lamps. 

He heard the splash of other horses 
as the two explorers he had brought 
along followed behind. 

The cold water brought French out 
of half-sleep — lately the most corn- 



123 




mon state of his mind unless some 
new crisis or decision demanded his 
attention. In the four days since the 
council meeting, he had yet to see a 
bed. Organizing Exodus had taken all 
his time. 

The horse strained up the sloping 
bank of the underground lake and con- 
tinued on, dripping. Once more 
French saw rails to the side. The tun- 
nel walls became visible as they left 
the area of the cave-in. Then, in 
another ten minutes or so, French saw 
moving lights in the distance. It was 
the lead column of the Exodus they’d 
passed some time ago on the way out 
to explore the tunnel. 

He spurred his horse into a trot, 
eager to get back now that ‘home’ was 
near. 

As he came abreast of the column, 
the people cheered. Those who had 
lamps lifted them high into the air and 
swung them back and forth. 

French waved his arm and smiled 
tiredly. He had yet to accept, deep 
down, that he was not a very big Chief 
in the eyes of these people. No, much 
more than that — the Consort of a god- 
dess. 

He wondered with an undertone of 
gallows humor whether simple, ordi- 
nary Rivera French would become a 
mythical figure someday. At the mo- 
ment, thank God, he was still consid- 
ered human. Unlike Miri. Miri had 
already assumed the mantle of divini- 
ty- 

More likely, he thought, I’ll be re- 
membered, if I am remembered, as 
one of the great crackpots of the 
eleventh century, conned into playing 
Moses by a small and nutty religious 
cult. They’ll laugh and joke about me. 
“French? Oh, French was that slum 
kid who made it big in the upper 

124 



world. One day he dreamt that the 
structures would crumble. And so he 
talked these people into leaving 
Ricardo, see, but when they got out of 
the tunnel, Ricardo was still there, 
same as ever.’’ 

On the other hand, he thought, 
there is Serenita. 

To think of the Cult Mother was to 
deepen the ambivalence he still felt 
about this — all this. - 

The tall, severe figure of the nun 
appeared before his eyes as she had 
stood in the darkness of an ancient 
parking lot, face shadowed by a cowl. 
Serenita had come down to visit Miri 
in the temporary headquarters French 
had established next to an enormous 
hall, anciently a station of the under- 
crust. He had followed her back up 
when she left again after tearful 
farewells with those sisters of the Cult 
who had joined the Exodus. He had 
confronted her in the darkness and had 
accused her of creating crisis, of de- 
liberately fostering disaster. 

Snatches of that conversation 
floated through his mind as he rode 
past the column, waving to the 
people. 

“I do nothing,” the nun had said. 
“I serve the Queen of Heaven, the 
sweet Jesus, God the Father, the Holy 
Ghost, the Trinity, the Great Un- 
known, the Cosmic One, Buddha, 
Krishna, Shiva, Aphrodite — name 
your god, Mr. French. I don’t make 
the Great Change, Mr. French. It 
comes of itself when the time is ripe. 
You and I and all the rest — we’re wit- 
nesses of a drama we don’t direct. 
There is no one in charge, Mr. French. 
No one. She is in charge.” 

He insisted that she had rigged the 
confusions surrounding the Helium 
round, had had her agents — like Miri 

GALAXY 




and Regina — interfere. 

The nun shook her head inside the 
cave of her cowl. “How can I cause 
war between Union and the tribes? 
War must be there in the heart first. 
We are a tiny Cult, Mr. French. We 
merely predicted the Great Change. 
We don’t pretend to rule — only to 
know.” 

The future cannot be known, he in- 
sisted. 

“You’re half right,” she said. 
“The future is murky — but some- 
times quite inevitable. When a seed is 
planted, it may or may not germinate. 
But once a flower has sprung up, it 
will surely wilt again? Eh?” 

She went on to liken culture to a 
plant that grows, flowers, gives 
fruit, and dies. The plant was West- 
ern Christendom and the world to- 
day its final manifestation. In the 
scheme of things, she said, the cul- 
ture had died long ago, long before 
LNW-XIII. Real life had left the 
dead trunk of the tree. Great 
Change meant a new beginning 
rather than an ending. 

A hundred million people dead, he 
protested. That’s what Great Change 
meant. He thought it was terrible. 

“Why?” she asked. “Life will go 
on. Cells may die, individuals may 
die, but life goes on. You are mes- 
merized by numbers, Mr. French, and 
you’re dishonest and sentimental on 
top of that. You agonize over the 
death of millions. But you killed two 
men yourself in the past week or so, 
and you never gave them a second 
thought.” 

The words shocked him with their 
truth. How did she know, he asked, 
had Miri — 

She shook her head ever so slightly. 
“I know you, Mr. French. I’m stand- 

HELIUM 



ing in your aura, you know, and I’m a 
psychic. I know all about you. The life 
of action. Adventure, danger, tests.” 
She smiled. “The mind,” she con- 
tinued, and pointed a slender index 
finger toward her temple. “The hu- 
man brain cannot encompass these 
cosmic events. But, as we say, ‘the 
Male pretends to rule. ’ Give it up, Mr. 
French. It doesn’t become you. 
You’re a man of the future. Action, 
eh? Life, movement, love. Not dark, 
puzzling thoughts and reckonings. 
You can’t make sense of it, so why 
pretend? You’ve done well so far. 
You’ve followed the Lady — your 
heart. Not the Male — your head. Your 
future is bright. Flowers in the 
meadow, Mr. French. Flowers in the 
meadow. ...” 

Flowers in the meadow. 

Her words echoed in his mind as he 
rode past the people in the tunnel, 
smiling and waving automatically. 
Miri said that Serenita spoke 
obscurely, that being the Lady’s 
way, indirection. The old woman 
had made him think, had convinced 
him of some things, had left him 
doubtful of others. He wasn’t sure 
at all about his future. 

The human mass he passed came 
from the very dregs of structure life, 
crackpots like himself, but of another 
sort. In the dim light of lumiglobes, 
their faces were blueish and sallow, 
gravitron-burned; their forms were 
stunted. They had nothing to lose. 

Maybe they’ll inherit the earth, it 
flashed in his mind. 

At last count ten thousand had 
joined the Exodus. They’d come 
down by hundreds of paths, following 
smuggling routes. They’d lain on the 
floor of the undercrust station in areas 
marked out by luminous paint, writh- 



125 




ing and spasming from pressure 
loss. Then, later, supplied with food 
and lights by foragers, they were 
formed into companies and launched 
on their way to ancient Chicago by 
several west-bound tunnels. 

Ten thousand superstitious slum 
dwellers, these, who had believed the 
rumors leaking out of Branco that the 
world would end and that a woman 
would lead the chosen to safety. 

French thought of the other Ricardo 
millions — who were more sensible. 
They too sought salvation, but in 
another way. Pent-up frustrations had 
exploded into riots all over the city. 

French left the first and reached the 
second group. The cheering and light 
waving began all over again. He fig- 
ured he had to pass ten more com- 
panies before he would get some food 
and drink. It was early afternoon, al- 
though you couldn’t tell it in the tun- 
nel’s perpetual night. He hadn’t eaten 
since morning. 

French wondered who would be 
more disappointed — those who’d 
stayed above and were now being 
systematically ‘pacified’ by the 
troops Harvanth had flown in from 
several neighboring structures. .or 
those who had thrown in their lot with 
the Goddess Miri and Her nearly di- 
vine consort, Rivera French. 

It would all depend on the secret 
agendas — Union’s and Ecofreaks. 

And God help us all, no matter 
what! 

An hour later he and his explorers 
arrived at the station and handed the 
horses to attendants at a kind of livery 
stable where Exodus leaders and 
explorer teams could get animals for 
tunnel travel. The animals had been 
obtained from tribesmen in the foot- 
hills of the Allagains. 



French mounted a makeshift ramp 
to the platform where people had long 
ago waited for trains. This portion of 
Eastcoast had been abandoned follow- 
ing LNW-XIII. The bunker complex 
where survivors had lived, experi- 
menting with gravitron, lay farther 
north. Explosions above had trapped 
large numbers of people down here. 
Their skeletal remains had been 
gathered and piled up by explorer 
teams to make way for the Exodus. 
French passed such a pile on his way 
through a darkish structure to the sta- 
tion hall. 

He surveyed the busy scene for a 
second. 

On his right a disorderly littering of 
humanity spasmed on the ground in 
the grip of Adjustment. Only children 
were up and about. They appeared 
immune to the effects of gravitron de- 
privation. Members of the Cult moved 
about between prone figures. Minis- 
tering, they called it, although all they 
really had to offer was an encouraging 
word — that plus the magic aura of the 
Cult itself. 

On the left a group of foragers piled 
boxes and canned mush into a 
pyramid as they unloaded a transport 
jumper. French wondered how they’d 
gotten the jumper down here. The 
foragers were ingenious and their job 
had been made easy by the riots. 
They’d hauled down into the 
catacombs an incredible tonnage of 
loot — food, textiles, lights, fuels, 
medicines, tools — everything that 
might be needed for a new start in life 
out there. 

French set himself in motion across 
the hall. He had reached the center, 
the point where the luminous lines of 
demarcation came together, when he 
heard the dreadful thundercrack.

GALAXY 




It seemed that he’d be known as a 
consort after all rather than as a 
crackpot. 



DYNAMITE THE REFINERIES 

Dart scurried out of Tack’s 
sleeping chamber as fast as his short 
legs would carry him. His face re- 
vealed fear, disgust, and unnatural 
excitement. 

The leader had satisfied his lust at 
last from all appearances, Dart de- 
cided. The Whore had been nowhere 
in evidence, although the rush of wa- 
ter from the shower stall adjacent to 
the chamber had hinted that she was 
cleaning up after the four-day orgy — 
and she had much to clean off, the 
Unclean Thing. The stench in that 
chamber still gagged Dart. Oh! 
They’d sweated and drunk and jutted 
up a fearful storm of sin and damna- 
tion in there, and the place had looked 
a mess. Dart had barely found a spot to 
put his feet on the floor inside, clut- 
tered as it was with empty trays and 
bottles. The linen had looked posi- 
tively grey with wear. And Tack him- 
self, pale shade of his past magnifi- 
cence, had lain darkly amidst the 
creased and mangled sheets with an 
iced towel wrapped about his shaved 
skull like a dirty turban of misery. 

In the outer chamber Dart turned 
jerkily at a fancied motion. His eyes 
were terrified. But he saw nothing in 
the murk. Damn you, he thought. 
Damn you, Barney. Don’t you dare 
stalk me in the shadows! And he made 
it out of there even faster. The ghost 
wouldn’t follow him into the bright 
sunshine outside. 

Six or seven members of Tack’s 
guard idled outside drawing circles in 



the red clay of the ground, joking with 
ferns from Jonny’s harem. The ferns 
spent much time around the Leader’s 
tent spying on their rival from Union, 
or else they were trying to seduce the 
men. 

Dart could almost smell the rutting 
fetor of one or two of them — 
especially that Henrietta, the mutie 
with the deep red eyes. He reckoned 
that nothing remained of the sacred 
Pact of Chastity. Alongside Barney’s 
hollow whispers, Dart had heard las- 
civious laughter in the woods at night. 
Jonny’s own sported with the jealous 
ferns among the pines while their mas- 
ter groaned inside the tent, completely 
captured by that Abomination from 
Union. First Bono, now Tack. In his 
grave Old Tack — 

No, not that! Dart hurriedly 
thought. He shivered again, only too 
aware that Barney’s ghost had come 
out into the sunlight after him and 
rfiust stand right next to him now. No 
thoughts about graves. An idea came 
to Dart. Barney must be buried. Yes. 
He probably still dangled from a rope 
in the embassy, the last Ecofreak in 
Union. He had to be put underground 
with a heavy stone to weigh him 
down. 

Across the empty circle of the 
camp, past the metal tower on top of 
which the shielding mechanism, 
equipped now with its critical silco- 
switch, gave forth an invisible but po- 
tent oscillation, he could see Ecofreak 
elders and leaders from other tribes 
stand outside the council tent waiting 
to hear what he had accomplished. 

They’d come north in copter after 
copter determined to persuade Jonny 
to hold off, to countermand his orders. 
But Tack refused, despite the disturb- 
ing speculations burly Sonder, the 



HELIUM 



127 




physicist from Kaysee, had offered. 
They wanted change, these gentle- 
men, but none dared to confront the 
Leader. They insisted that Dart do it. 
“You are the only man he trusts,” 
they’d argued. And they’d forced him 
to go in. 

Well, he’d gone — but he hadn’t 
pressed Tack hard. Dart had no inten- 
tion of ending up like that damn-fool 
Gulfrat leader who’d barged in there 
two days ago. That night his body had 
been found bruised black and blue by 
the boot-heels of the guards. Dart had 
said “Yes, sir” and “no, sir” to 
Tack’s curt commands. Yessir! Yes, 
sir, I’ll bring you copies of the trans- 
mission to Wellhead. As soon as we 
get through. And I’ll do it, too, by 
God! 

Dart set out across the empty circle 
toward the council tent. It might have 
been so nice, triumphant. Union had 
delivered the parts. Jets and copters 
had moved the precious components 
all over Hinterland. They’d been 
snapped into place. Hinterland was 
safe and secure. Or was it? 

Sonder wasn’t sure. Dart had been 
present when Sonder had looked pa- 
tiently at one of the ear-shaped com- 
ponents. His thick fingers, square 
nails had scratched at the fine, thin 
lines of reddish copper print laid down 
into the ear by micro- welders. Sonder 
had shaken his head. The color. He 
didn’t like the color. Some other kind 
of metal might be alloyed with the 
copper, just enough to destroy its ef- 
fectiveness. He wasn’t sure that all the 
parts had defects, not even that any 
had them . The parts behaved correctly 
enough in the small test device Sonder 
carried about with him. But he 
claimed that Union would try to avoid 
an obvious defect. The parts had to 

128 



have thorough testing, and that meant 
a testing program in Kaysee, perhaps 
taking three weeks or so. Dart had 
been sent in to convice Tack to give 
them time. Dart had one of the ears in 
his pocket, and Sonder had shown him 
how to explain the problem to the 
Leader. But Dart hadn’t even taken 
the ear out. Tack had not been in a 
funning mood, not at all, and he’d 
darkly muttered about trouble-makers 
who might get some attention from the 
boys. 

Dart avoided the eyes of the people 
as he walked past them into the coun- 
cil tent (Barney had a trick he liked 
to play; he would possess now this 
man and now that and stare at Dart 
accusingly through the man’s eyes.) 
Inside Dart took up a central posi- 
tion and waited. 

Among the men who entered was 
Fannin. He kept to the back, 
shadowed by the sloping canvas, his 
eyes alert. He looked at Dart and knew 
that Dart had failed — could have pre- 
dicted that he would. The bad news 
were in. Sonder threw up all these 
clouds of suspicion. Tack would 
never admit that he had failed. Better 
to go down in a blaze of glory, eh? 
Back home he wouldn’t stand a 
chance, but here he could still lord it 
over the tribes, surrounded by his 
goons. 

So what if Union bombs the tribal 
settlements, Fanin thought. This camp 
won’t be hit. It’s too small a target. 
The Great Leader might survive the 
holocaust. Then, gathering the rem- 
nants about him, he’ll try to play the 
king of kings. 

Only, of course, I won’t let him do 
that. Its frightfully uncomfortable 
around Jonny-boy now that he has let 
himself go. 



GALAXY 




Dart held up a hand and the mur- 
murs stopped. 

“Tack is adamant. Dynamite the 
refineries. Cut the pipeline. It’s still 
the same order, and he wants to see the 
cable transmitting the command. In 
fact he wants a console moved into his 
tent so he can monitor what we say . ” 
The people groaned. Dart held up 
a hand, asking for silence. 

“He said that Ricardo will fall to- 
night by his reckoning , and he plans to 
watch it. We’ve been asked to or- 
ganize a column to move up to the 
edge of the Desolation. We move in 
two hours.’’ 

“Wait a minute !” 

Fannin glanced to the side where 
burly Sonder stood. Sonder was one 
of the most patient men alive, but now 
even Sonder seemed to have lost his 
composure. He. moved forward 
through the tribesmen, stocky, angry. 
His red beard blazed up like fire when 
he passed through a sun beam falling 
from the skylight. Sonder stopped di- 
rectly in front of Dart, fists 
clenched tightly. 

‘ ‘Did you tell him? Did you tell him 
we need time? Did you show him? 
Well, speak up, Franco!” 

“Get away from me, get away from 
me!” 

Dart threw up his hands and backed 
away from Sonder as if he had seen an 
apparition. Then he controlled him- 
self and glanced abashedly at the 
people. 

“Don’t you rush at me like that 
again,” he growled at Sonder in a 
changed tone. 

Fannin was puzzled by Dart’s man- 
ner. The old man had become even 
more paranoid since his return from 
Ricardo. 

“Yes, I told him, but he wouldn’t 

HELIUM 



listen. He nearly threw me out.” 

“Did you show him? The color?” 

Dart hesitated. 

“Well?” 

Dart looked away from Sonder and 
still refused to answer. 

“You didn’t show him, did you? 
You were too cowardly — like all the 
rest of you so-called leaders.” Sonder 
turned and swept the people with a 
glance. His blue eyes, usually so 
placid, burned with anger. “Well, 
gentlemen, I will tell him. In no uncer- 
tain terms. Give it to me. Give me the 
part.” 

He wants to die, Fannin thought, 
watching Dart hand Sonder the part. 
Next to Fannin Sonder’s friends 
moved nervously toward the entrance . 
They intercepted the out-rushing Son- 
der, but he shook loose the restraining 
arms and disregarded the pleading of 
his friends. 

High time to mosey on along, Fan- 
nin decided. Better to be out of the 
way. Tack might order a general car- 
nage. 

Fannin made for the entrance 
slowly and inconspicuously, while up 
front Dart squirmed under questions. 
Outside at last, Fannin slipped off be- 
tween tents and then, in the obscurity 
of some pines, he went up into the 
valley toward that distant barn. 

Bono had been right, more or less, 
he reflected, recalling the conversa- 
tion he’d had with Bono in the copter. 
Tack would blow it, Bono had as- 
serted. Now Fannin knew that it was 
so. He would head out, up into the 
Allagains. He knew an isolated hut up 
there where a man could hole up until 
the mess was over. Meanwhile, he’d 
just open Bono’s cage a crack. After 
what Bono had been through, he’d 
take care of the king of kings without 

129 




much urging. 

He walked carefully, wanting to 
catch the guard by surprise. He had 
almost reached the barn when he 
spied, in the distance, the silvery 
gleam of a Union airship headed to- 
ward the camp. He understood in- 
stantly. They had also found the trail 
of desolation at last and came in 
search of Regina. 

Fannin decided to seek safety on the 
other side of the ridge. But before he 
could carry out this intention, the air- 
ship suddenly described a graceful 
turn and headed back the way it had 
come. 



NUMBER ONE 

The air ship rushed back to Ricar- 
do. The chilling message over the 
radio had caused the pilot to lose all 
color. The soldiers in the back were 
unnaturally still. Blottingham under- 
stood their silence. Gravitron failure 
made you think. 

From the distance Ricardo looked 
safe and sound — five silvery stalks of 
urban life swaying almost visibly with 
the motion of air masses heading out 
over the Atlantic. Blottingham didn’t 
expect to see anything, of course. 
Grav failure did not mean immediate 
structure collapse. That would follow 
in some hours unless the problem was 
corrected. At worst the highest levels 
would begin to sag a little by nightfall, 
metal pressing on metal, molecules 
cozying up to each other. 

Blottingham reached for the radio 
speaker and gave a string of instruc- 
tions to Carmody, but when he stop- 
ped and Carmody had a chance to 
speak, he learned that his aide was 
more or less on top of things. Blotting - 

130 



ham hung the radio speaker back on 
the dash, sat back in his chair next to 
the pilot, and ran a hand over the red 
brush of hair on top of his head. His 
face was tense. 

Lately he had learned to hate the 
excercise of power. The burden of re- 
sponsibility rested too heavily now 
that Unsler had had a stroke and was 
both paralyzed and struck dumb by a 
failure of his nervous system . Blotting- 
ham could see him: one eye frozen 
open, filled with terrorized pleading, 
a strange noise in his throat as he tried 
to speak past a paralyzed tongue. The 
stroke had come while the Old Man 
had watched the riots on the Media. 
Even if he had wanted to, Blottingham 
couldn’t draw on support from Sidney 
who, though he was back again, was 
back an imbecile, a raving maniac, 
calling every man Tanti and blabber- 
ing incoherently about his initiation. 
Blottingham had ordered him locked 
up in a spare cubo right next door to 
his stroke-struck father. As for the 
cabinet, the rest of the family, Blot- 
tingham had kept the information 
from them. Had that been a good deci- 
sion? 

Yes, he decided, it was a good deci- 
sion. In times like these it was best to 
hold down panic, even if it meant that 
Blottingham had to endure the weight 
of power. 

He fell into a reverie, and it occur- 
red to him that he could continue as 
Unifier-in-all-but-name indefinitely if 
he wished. Hypnosis and drugs might 
be used to prepare Unsler for rare pub- 
lic appearances. Tapes of his voice 
might be used for speeches. A blurry 
picture on Media. Then it occur- 
red to Blottingham that he didn’t re- 
ally want the power. It nauseated him . 

The airship docked at last. Blotting - 

GALAXY 




ham hurried to a waiting limo. Out- 
side the airport he noticed at once that 
the troubles were greater than he had 
anticipated. He could hear a 
cacaphony of sirens near and far. The 
rarely used public address system 
syruped with soothomuse. What 
damn fool had ordered that? Nothing 
panicked people more than hearing 
soothomuse on the PA system. Blot- 
tingham got in and angrily slammed 
the door. 

“What’s happening?” he asked the 
driver. 

The man shook his head. He acti- 
vated the gravitron and lifted the 
jumper above the movebelt. “God 
help us all,” he said. “We’ve heard it 
twice already.” 

“Heard what?’’ Blottingham 
asked. 

“The clap.,” the man said. 

“What?!” Blottingham cried. 

The driver nodded. “Somebody re- 
ally screwed up. No warning. It’s just 
like ’44. It’s East Tower. The mobs 
are pouring out. This is big, Mr. Blot- 
tingham, big!” 

Almost as if to underline what San- 
chez had just said, came the sicken- 
ing, sharp, ear-ringing report. Blot- 
tingham jerked involuntarily. 

Sanchez looked at him, cocked his 
head, made a face. 

God! Grav failure must have been 
under way for hours, unreported. It 
must have begun even before he’d left 
to follow Regina’s telltale track into 
Hinterland. 

They crossed from West toward 
Central Tower througn the beltway. 
From the mixing bowl in Central Tow- 
er, Blottingham observed a mass of 
humanity moving onto the beltway 
from East. A dark ooze of people. 
Blottingham shuddered. People tram- 

HELIUM 



pled people in a kind of frenzied, ani- 
mal panic. 

Sanchez lifted the vehicle up into 
Central’s shaft. 

Arrived at Top Level, Blottingham 
ran through the lobby where Union’s 
thirty-nine structures hung around the 
wall around a centrally placed map of 
the Helium pipeline. He saw no one, 
as he ran. The place was deserted, 
swept clean by panic. He took an 
elevator to the office wing. 

Not everyone had fled. A handful 
of his closest aides were still on the 
job. They had gathered in an open area 
usually occupied by visitors. Their 
faces were ashen. They formed a 
clump around a visiset, turned when 
Blottingham came into the room. 

Carmody disengaged himself from 
the others, neat as usual, his black hair 
almost blue of sheen and meticulously 
combed. He said: 

“Paul, things are in a terrible 
shape. Communications are down. 
Belmonte can’t be located. The 
people in Media laugh when we call 
and disconnect us. We’re trying to 
raise Defense, but no one responds. ” 
“Defense?” Blottingham asked. 
“Why Defense?” 

“Haven’t you been told?” Car- 
mody asked. “There is no Helium.” 
Blottingham gave Carmody an un- 
comprehending stare. The man re- 
peated his message slowly and with 
emphasis. 

“There. .is. .no. .Helium!” 
“Are you mad?” Carmody must 
have discovered this recently, since 
their discussion on the radio. 

“No, Paul, it’s the God’s truth. 
The storage tanks are empty. No 
people in the Pits. The expanders 
are shut down. And there’s nothing 
in the pipeline, not one molecule. 



131 




We finally got Engineering to check 
it out.” Carmody paused. Then he 
went on. ‘‘There’s been an Interdic- 
tion, Paul, lasting more than four 
days. But nobody reported it. The 
records have been falsified. All the 
gauge watchers are gone. It’s some 
kind of conspiracy.” 

Blottingham sank down into a 
chair. He rested his flat palm on top 
of his brush of hair. 

We’ll be mobbed. It was his first 
thought. Once the other towers began 
to crack, the mobs would make for 
Central Tower. It was the only one 
that had a chance. Its drums could be 
operated with Helium from the stand- 
by air liquefaction units anchored out 
at sea. But Central Tower couldn’t 
hold all the millions. If they came 
here. 

He looked up and asked, ‘‘What 
about the other structures?” 

“Interdictions have just been 
reported — but they just started.” 
“Oh, God!” Blottingham rose 
abruptly. “Gentlemen, I’m afraid 
we’ll have to come out into the 
open. I mean about the Unifier and 
Sidney. This is big trouble. We’ll 
have to call the cabinet.” 

Wry smiles greeted this announce- 
ment. 

“Too late,” Carmody said. He 
beckoned with a hand. Blottingham 
followed Carmody out to the lip of the 
glass-enclosed terrace. Carmody 
pointed to a large fleet of ships — 
jumpers, limos, and individual jump 
tubes could be seen heading away 
from Ricardo. 

“There’s your cabinet, Paul. And 
everybody else. Gone to save 
Number One.” 

“Harvanth?” 

“I suspect he was the first to go. I 

132 



told you. We can’t get anyone at De- 
fense.” 

Blottingham stared out the win- 
dow, chin in hand. His elbow rested 
on an arm he’d folded across his chest. 

An unreported Interdiction. 
That could only mean that tribes and 
Proctor were colluding. Only men 
completely loyal to Proctor could 
have hidden an Interdiction. Which 
meant that Proctor controlled the BTA 
even from the prison to which he had 
been transferred. And that meant — 
Belmonte was part of the plot! 

Suddenly Blottingham giggled. It 
tickled and amused him that Proctor 
and Belmonte and all manner of men 
from BTA and other agencies had 
deliberately created chaos. He felt the 
chaos. What he saw was peaceful 
enough — the glint of silver from the 
airships, a few thin clouds, the dark 
Atlantic. But throughout Ricardo 
raged a maddened mob. Those thun- 
dercracks would drive people crazy. 
He felt it also. He was just human. 
And Proctor thought he could control 
this phenomenon? Proctor was crazier 
than Blottingham had imagined. 

He chuckled to himself. He turned 
to the men just as another crack 
sounded — from the direction of West 
Tower this time. It was physical, tan- 
gible. It caused involuntary 
physiological response. Blottingham 
noticed that he was on hands and 
knees on the floor. He stared at tiles 
marked by the Unsler flower. He 
laughed. 

“Do it again,” he cried, turning to 
the west. He pointed an index finger in 
imitation of a pistol. “Do it again. 
Bang, bang, bang. Gotchya!” 

The staff, also on the floor, stared at 
him with terrorized eyes. Blottingham 
didn’t care. Stupid of him to pretend to 

GALAXY 




be in charge. Insane of them to look at 
him with those children eyes. Who did 
they think he was? God? 

His mind snapped back to reality. 

“The Ecofreaks,” he said in a 
cool tone. “Did anyone talk with the 
embassy?” 

Carmody scrambled up. “None of 
the embassies answered our calls. We 
think that. ...” 

Carmody’s voice trailed out. His 
eyes stared past Blottingham and out 
through the drilla-glass. All the others 
on the floor did the same. Blottingham 
turned to see what mesmerized them. 

The air outside visibly trembled as 
if heated by a gigantic fire below. 
Blottingham knew the cause. Com- 
pressing plastosteel generated heat. In 
East, in West, the upper levels would 
be heating up. The drilla-glass would 
melt. The seals would break. Then 
escaping air would create a fantastic 
up-draft in the shafts, powerful 
enough to lift men — an internal ty- 
phoon. They couldn’t stay here. They 
had to leave. 

In quick succession came a series of 
sharp reports. Crack, crack, crack, 
crack-crack-crack. Fireworks explod- 
ing against the roof of your mouth. 
Everything swayed and shook. Things 
fell on the tiles, shattered and slid. 
Blottingham, like the others, ran 
across the room crazed with fear. 
His bowels and bladder released 
their contents, but he was unaware 
of it. When the sound stopped, he 
stood embracing a door. Around 
him men lay on the ground in fetal 
postures, rocking. One man had 
three fingers in his mouth and 
sucked violently. 

“Bang, bang,” Blottingham 
lisped. Then, in the continuing si- 
lence, he found control again. 

HELIUM 



He cried: “Let’s get out of here!” 

His mind latched on to a simple 
plan and held tenaciously. In the hall 
outside, as in all halls, hung cabinets 
with emergency gear, insurance 
against surface ruptures: oxygen 
masks and cannisters, sensitized 
gravitron webbing, medical kits, the 
like. He ran out toward the cabinets, 
aware now that his robe was soiled, 
that waste moistened his legs. He tore 
open doors and threw gear toward his 
staff. Some had followed on foot. 
Others had crawled after him on hands 
and knees. 

“Check your seal,” he cried. “It 
should be blue. If it isn’t, take 
another. Don’t pull the rip-cord until 
we’re outside.” 

Another series of thundercracks 
made them all curl into terrorized balls 
on the floor. One man had inadver- 
tently pulled the rip-cord on his gravi- 
tron gear and now floated in mid-air. 
Blottingham pulled him down and 
made him exchange the webbing. 
Then he ran down the hall followed by 
the staff. 

On the way he passed an office 
where a visiset glowed. He thought he 
heard Proctor’s voice exhorting the 
public, but it might have been illu- 
sion. Carmody puffed behind him and 
now called: “What about the Uni- 
fier?” Blottingham shook his head 
and waved a hand dismissing the Uni- 
fier. He had a simple plan: escape. 
He couldn’t be bothered. 

They reached the emergency exit, a 
small chamber. He pushed the men 
into the room and carefully closed the 
seal-door. He’d never used such an 
exit, and he looked about, undecided. 
Glowing dials on the wall drew his 
attention. In a second he understood 
the mechanism. 



133 




“Put on your masks,” he called. 

He donned his own and tested it. 
Then, glancing about, he assured 
himself that all had done the same. 

“All right,” he called. His voice 
was muffled by the mask. ‘ ‘Grab your 
rip-cords. When the door opens, out 
you go. Run out. You’ve got to get 
well away from the building. Once 
you’re out there, pull.” 

He turned dials. 

In seconds a hissing sound indi- 
cated that internal and external pres- 
sures were being equalized. Then the 
door swung open, and they felt the 
intense heat of the air outside. 

“Run!” Blottingham yelled. “Go 
on, somebody. Carmody! Go!” 

Carmody took a run and leapt out 
into the void. His head disappeared in 
a second. Blottingham walked to the 
door and peered out. Carmody had 
pulled his cord. The activated web- 
bing had broken his fall. He floated 
downward gently, his body-weight 
overcoming the gravitron. He would 
have a soft landing. 

Blottingham turned to the men. 

“Easy,” he said. “Nothing to it.” 

At that moment the dreadful sound 
came again. This time it wasn’t 
cushioned by plastosteel or by 
drilla-glass. The air pulse slammed 
into Blottingham and threw him 
back into the chamber. He fell on 
top of others at the back of the 
room. When the sound died out at 
last, they scrambled up. One by one 
Blottingham launched the men out. 
They floated down in an uneven 
string — men in the bright robes of 
the nobility. 

Alone at last, Blottingham went to 
the back of the room so that he would 
get a good start for his jump. Then he 
hesitated, brushed his hair. His efforts 

134 



to help the staff escape had banked his 
terror somewhat. Now rationality as- 
serted itself. He recalled Carmody’s 
words in the hall: “What about the 
Unifier?” Unsler couldn’t be aban- 
doned. Simple humanity demanded 
that he should be saved — if not from 
the collapse of Central Tower, then 
from the mobs Proctor would launch. 
Blottingham, for one, had more of a 
sense of responsibility than to save 
Number One and let the world go 
hang. 

He turned dials again. The outer 
door of the chamber closed. Blotting- 
ham heard a hissing sound and felt 
the rise of pressure. He opened the 
inner door. Once more he hesitated. 
He had a hunch he shouldn’t do this. 
He’d had a simple plan. Why change 
it now? But he put the feeling down 
and ran, drawn by years of loyalty to 
the Old Man. 

Moments later he burst into one of 
Unsler’s sitting rooms carrying 
grav- webbing and oxygen gear. The 
sight of men in police uniforms made 
him recoil, but he was too late. The 
men had turned toward him. As they 
did so, Blottingham recognized Bel- 
monte kneeling on the floor next to an 
armchair. His dark, inscrutable face 
was turned toward Blottingham, but 
his hands continued to press down on 
a pillow. The pillow lay on the Uni- 
fier’s face. 

“Get him!” Belmonte said evenly 
to no one in particular. 

Blottingham turned abruptly and 
ran down the hall. He heard a series of 
explosions. 

They were not thundercracks this 
time. He fell down, tom by a force, 
but he felt no pain, only a kind of 
giddiness. His head was full of 
fireflies, his throat full of blood. He 

GALAXY 




laughed inwardly. He rolled away 
into laughter. 



NO CAUSE FOR PANIC 

P roctor sweated under the bright 
lights. He could see almost nothing. 
He spoke to the cameras before him 
and to the microphones — those 
mounted on the lectern as well as the 
one that floated in the air just in front 
of his head. 

He exhorted the people to calm 
down. The Helium already flowed 
again, he told them. The thunder- 
cracks would continue for a while 
longer, but the danger was past. He 
urged the invisible masses to get off 
the beltways. He told them to return to 
their cubo homes. All is well. Calm 
down. He repeated this message over 
and over again. 

His voice resounded over millions 
of visisets, thousands of loudspeak- 
ers. 

Proctor hoped that his forcibly calm 
tone would reassure them at last. He 
had been before the cameras for more 
than an hour now, interrupted only by 
infernal blasts of sound. Yet he per- 
sisted, despite a growing hoarseness 
and fatigue. From time to time Hondo 
Weinberger had appeared to stand be- 
tween the cameras. Weinberger moni- 
tored the activities outside through 
banks of cameras. At each approach, 
Weinberger had turned his head from 
side to side to indicate that panic still 
persisted, that Proctor should con- 
tinue to talk. 

From the corner of his eye, Proctor 
now saw another figure between the 
cameras — Kron. Kron made an urgent 
gesture, repeated it twice. 

Something had gone wrong, Proc- 

HELIUM 



tor realized, but it didn’t bother him 
too much. In such an operation, some- 
thing was bound to go wrong. 
Nevertheless, he brought his remarks 
to a close. He repeated his assertion 
that Helium flowed. He called for 
calm. 

Away from the circle of light, he 
mopped his face with a handkerchief. 

Kron said: “Ecofreak isn’t re- 
sponding. We have sent the message 
five times. With the code signal.” 

“Are you sure?” 

A string of thundercracks cut off 
Korn’s answer. Proctor looked at the 
people in the studio, pleased at their 
discipline. Of course they knew that 
the danger would pass. Unlike the 
mob. 

Proctor had not expected quite 
so much panic. Much time had also 
been lost in his very slow progress 
from the police confinement to Media 
Central. The beltway had been im- 
passable, filled with trampled 
corpses. 

The noise subsided. “I have bad 
news, Res,” Korn said. “Helium In- 
terdictions have been reported from 
all structures. It all started about an 
hour ago.” 

“Damn fools,” Proctor said grim- 
ly. He meant the Ecofreaks. He imag- 
ined the tribal yokels dancing and 
grinning in stupid glee, thinking they 
had outwitted Proctor. They were 
even more careless than Proctor had 
assumed they were. He had expected 
them to do the obvious — test the parts 
carefully before making a move, a 
matter of a week or two. They hadn’t 
done so. They were led by a madman 
or fool. 

In a corner of the studio, BTA had 
installed a communications center. 
Proctor made for that area now, step- 

135 




ping over cables. He stopped before a 
keyboard console manned by a young 
man. From a corner of his eye, Proctor 
glanced toward a set of gauges 
mounted on wheeled consoles. BTA 
staff and a clump of studio people 
stood about and stared at the gauges. 

Proctor didn’t like that clump. He 
knew that the gauges showed zero gas 
flow. He lowered his voice as he 
spoke to the operator. 

“Send this message to Ecofreak: 
‘This is Reston Proctor. You must 
immediately restore Helium flow. 
The silcoplast components. he 
waited until the operator caught up. 
“The silcoplast components are de- 
liberately faulty and will not protect 
you from nuclear attack.” He waited 
again. “I shall order an attack on your 
settlements within fifteen minutes un- 
less Helium flow is restored to 
Ricardo and the Interdiction to the 
other structures is terminated. 
Acknowledge immediately.” 

Proctor turned questioningly to 
Kron. Kron nodded as if to say: Good. 
You have no other choice. 

Proctor said to the operator, “Give 
them the prearranged code.” 

The man typed numbers. 

The machine clackered rythmically 
in readiness. There was no acknowl- 
edgement, only the noise. 

Korn said: “While you were speak- 
ing, Belmonte called to say: ‘Mission 
accomplished.’ They also got 
Blottingham. But most of the family 
had already fled.” 

“Sidney?” Proctor asked. 

“He is dead,” Kron said. 

Proctor nodded and turned back to 
the machine. He noticed the clump of 
men near the gauges again. They 
looked expectantly at Proctor. Proctor 
forced himself to smile, gave them an 

136 



encouraging nod, only too aware that 
his face was a grimace of strain. 

He allowed himself to think the un- 
thinkable. What if there had been a 
communications failure? That could 
be disastrous. A simple breakdown in 
a component, unnoticed at their end. 
The fate of Union could then be de- 
cided by an electronic wafer. He 
turned to Kron. 

“How do we communicate with 
General Martinez?” 

“By radio,” Kron said. 

“I have to have a talk with him,” 
Proctor said. “But could you. .’’He 
gestured toward the people around the 
gauges. “I don’t want half the world 
to listen in.” 

Korn moved toward the group. 

Now a series of thundercracks 
much longer and much more intense 
than any before exploded the air in the 
studio. The entire place trembled and 
moved. The lights dimmed, went out, 
came on, dimmed, flickered. A cam- 
era broke loose from its moorings and 
sailed across the open space in the 
center. It careened as its small wheels 
hit loose cable on the floor. It crashed 
against a wall, emitting sparks. Wein- 
berger, his hands to his ears, stumbled 
toward Proctor who half hung by the 
communications console. Kron had 
gone down on his knees. His head was 
just above the floor as he waited for 
the noise to stop. 

Proctor thought: We’re safe. We’re 
safe. Central Tower still has Helium. 
It’s nothing. Nothing at all. 

Beneath this conscious incantation, 
he perceived for the first time a kind of 
dark doubt. Could the plan misfire? 
Could the game be up? Could all the 
plans, deeds, acts of his life have led 
to a strange end in a visi studio? To die 
in a man-made storm of his own devis- 



GALAXY 




ing? The final practical joke? 

The noise stopped at last and Proc- 
tor gratefully submerged his thoughts 
in action. He moved to a radio and 
gestured to the operator. The man had 
lain down on the floor, trying to hide 
from the thunder. Kron no longer had 
to disperse the observing group. The 
people had scattered all about the 
studio. 

“Get me Martinez,” Proctor said. 

The operator’s voice quavered, his 
face was white, sweat stood on his 
brow. 

“Martinez here.” The voice had a 
cheerful sound. 

Proctor took the microphone. 
“This is Proctor. Are you all right, 
Richard? Where are you?” 

“I’m fine, Res. I’m in a command 
ship. We are about ten klicks off 
shore.” 

“Are you up on the latest develop- 
ments?” 

“Are you kidding?” Martinez 
cried. “I’m up to my ears from the 
area commands. Helium Interdic- 
tions. The people in the regions are 
agitated but not panicked yet, of 
course. Was this part of the plan?” 

Proctor ignored the question. He 
said: “Richard, can you explode a 
bomb some kilometers from Well- 
head? In a safe area? By safe I mean 
away from the pipeline facilities. 
Quickly? I have to send these birds a 
message they’ll understand.” 

There was silence from the other 
side. Only static hissed. Then Mar- 
tinez came on. “It can be done, Res, 
but it’ll take time.” 

“Why? Why time?” 

“We overlooked something, Res. 
The bloody heat. Our automatic 
equipment is ruined, fused. We have 
to go to manual firing, which means 

HELIUM 



time. I’m out here supervising the div- 
ing operations. We’re sending people 
down to the undersea bunkers.” 
God! Proctor said: “Why don’t you 
order a firing from Husten?” 

“That’ll take time too. This is a 
missile launch, Res, and Husten 
won’t do it on my orders alone. They 
think I’m just a duty officer. They’ll 
want verifaxed orders from Harvanth, 
countersigned by Unsler.” 

Who’ll never sign anything ever 
again , Proctor said. “How much 
time?” he asked. 

“Two hours, three hours, maybe 
longer.” 

Silence. Oh, God! Proctor thought. 
Aloud he said: “The towers will be 
down by then.” 

“I’m sorry,” Martinez said, “I 
just can’t act any faster.” 

The long narrow face, the white 
sunburst of hair, gold-rimmed glasses 
of Weinberger approached. Wein- 
berger started to speak, but Proctor 
silenced him with a raised hand. 

“Richard, get ready to fire as soon 
as you are able. I don’t know what’ll 
happen. I have to evacuate Ricardo. 
You get ready and wait for orders. But 
if a tower goes, you are on your own. 
Obliterate the swine. Try to get help 
from the regions. Tell them every- 
thing. It’s too late for anything else.” 
Proctor handed the speaker to the 
operator and turned to Weinberger. 

Weinberger burst out: “Res, my 
God, the intertower beltway broke in 
two places. More than a million must 
have fallen. Sucked out by the vac- 
uum. Oh, Jesus, Res. You’ve got to 
get back on again. Will this never 
stop? Have we got the gas yet? 

Proctor slowly shook his head. No 
gas. No Helium. 

“I’ll speak to them,” he said. 

137 




He took a path toward the podium 
up ahead. He formulated words as he 
went. 

People of Ricardo. Mechanical dif- 
ficulties make it look as if there will be 
a short delay before Helium flow can 
be restored to normal. In the interests 
of safety. .evacuate in an order- 
ly. .no cause for panic. .no cause 
for panic. 

HUNTING THE OTHER 

Bono had been in the darkness of 
his tunnel so long, he did not realize 
that day had fled and that darkness had 
descended outside. Down there, hyp- 
notized by the rythm of his digging, 
he’d lost track of time. 

He crawled out of the tunnel slowly 
with a wiggling motion, feet first, 
scooching up with the action of his 
elbows and knees. The smell of clay 
was strong about him. At first he had 
liked the smell. But after three days, 
four days, five days of digging — he 
had no real sense of time — he had 
learned to hate it. It was thick, hard, 
red clay. It clung to his hands, cloth- 
ing, beard, hair. He was a red man, 
red all over, a clay man, a man a-fire 
with the earth. 

His slow motion brought him to the 
surface. His feet hit the bale of hay he 
had placed over the opening to hide it. 
He pushed it aside and immediately 
heard the hateful sounds coming over 
the loudspeaker mounted high in the 
gable of the barn that was his 
prison — so high that he couldn’t reach 
it to destroy it. 

Bono climbed all the way out and 
stood up. It was dark in the barn. The 
sun had still been up the last time he 
had taken a rest. He took strips of 

138 



clay-soiled cloth from his pockets, 
tom from his underwear, and he stuff- 
ed them slowly, methodically into his 
ears. 

The plugs diminished the sound 
somewhat, but not entirely. He knew 
that the air about him vibrated with the 
tape recording of Regina’s treachery. 
The noises of their fornication pene- 
trated the cloth and touched his ear- 
drums ever so slightly. He heard the 
grunts and groans and the rhythmic beat 
of bodies on the bed. He heard the 
smacks and slaps and the agonized 
breathing. He heard Tack mumble in- 
coherently as he reached out for peaks 
of passion; and he heard Regina cry 
out when the dam of her resistance 
broke and she stumbled into orgasm. 
And he heard their breathing subside 
again. Over and over. The tape was 
spliced so that a series of strivings 
followed each other, and when the 
string was completed, it started all 
over again. The tape ran and ran. Day 
and night. Bono heard it in his sleep. 
Only in the tunnel could he find peace . 

He stood for a second in the middle 
of the barn. He had no idea of the mad 
picture he made: a red apparition with 
crazed eyes; a beard matted with mat- 
ter, its forks fused into a single clump 
of hair and mud; ears extruding strips 
of cloth that had been white; arms 
slackly suspended; fingers half curled; 
nails broken and black. He was alone 
and knew himself unobserved. He 
was a soul, now, his physical being 
immaterial. But his soul too was on 
fire with a red burning. 

He undid his fly and urinated where 
he stood. The pure physical act almost 
brought him back to sanity, but the 
touch of his genitals reminded him of 
a wondrous night in a cabin high in the 
Allagains — and its ruin, heard now 

GALAXY 




muted but for that reason so much 
more intensely. 

An overwhelming rage gripped 
Bono. 

“God damn you, bitch!’’ he yelled 
with total abandon. “God damn you, 
God damn you to hell. God damn you, 
God damn you.” 

Screaming this at the top of his 
lungs, he went down on his knees and 
pounded the hay-littered ground with 
a balled fist, putting all of his strength 
into the act. 

Then he sagged down into a sitting 
position, his fury momentarily spent. 

God, he was tired. His back, legs, 
arms — they all ached from the endless 
labor of digging. He longed to sleep 
but knew that he would go back to 
digging again after a brief respite. By 
morning, if his calculations were cor- 
rect, he would be far enough from the 
barn, on the side which the guard 
avoided in the morning sun, to emerge 
unobserved. And then! 

And then he would be the incarna- 
tion of vengeance. He would be pure 
hatred stalking. He would be Evil with 
legs and arms and trunk and head and 
hands — hands that would seek her 
neck; hands that would castrate her 
lover as if he were a sheep. 

Bono brooded over fantasies of re- 
venge so vivid he momentarily forgot 
the tape recording. He sat for a while. 
Then, groaning shamelessly, he rose. 
He glanced with longing up to the 
hayloft where, behind the sound- 
cushioning bales of hay, he had 
snatched what little sleep he had al- 
lowed himself. But not tonight. He 
didn’t even dare to lay down. He 
might go off and not awaken until 
morning. A drink of water. A bit of 
the bread left him from his single 
meal. Then he’d go down again. 

HELIUM 



He walked wearily toward the door 
where the empty bowl and the pitcher 
stood. He bent down for the pitcher, 
aware of muscles in his back he hadn’t 
known he had. Near the pitcher he 
noticed something he didn’t re- 
member seeing before. Something 
white. He picked it up. A piece of 
scriptoplast? Huu? He unfolded it and 
dimly saw writing, but it was too dark 
to read. 

Bono moved closer to the barn 
door, to a spot where through a crack 
between door and wall a little of the 
moonlit night came into the interior. 
As he did so he touched the door. With 
a painful screech of unoiled hinges, 
the door opened. 

Bono stared in surprise. He ex- 
pected to hear the cry of the guard. 
Instead there was only silence out 
there: the silence of nature, filled with 
a rasp of cricks. He stepped out and 
immediately saw the guard. The man 
appeared dead; had he been strang- 
led? 

In the moonlight Bono read the 
note. It said ‘Remember who helped 
you. F.’ 

F? Fannin. Yes. Had to be Fannin. 

Bono puzzled over the slip. In three 
days, four days, whatever the time 
had been, he had almost forgotten that 
the world had people other than him- 
self, Regina, and Tack. Fannin. His 
mind went back to that conversation in 
the helicopter the day he was 
caught. Something must have hap- 
pened. Fannin had decided to secure 
himself a friend. 

Far away Bono heard thunder 
claps. He looked up at the sky. Odd. 
The night was unusually clear. He 
could see a trillion stars. Yes, there it 
was, the dust- wash of the Milky Way. 
He had thought to gather it up for Her 

139 




once — long ago. Thunder? Strange. 

Then Bono suddenly ducked and 
sought the shadow of the barn wall. 
He hadn’t seen anything. He had sim- 
ply remembered that he was an es- 
caped prisoner. Another guard might 
be on his way now to relieve this fel- 
low. Bono glanced to the side and 
examined the guard closely. Here was 
another odd thing. This man should 
have been relieved some time ago. He 
lay there stiffly, his balled fists high 
up, tugging at something around his 
neck. Strangled. Marks in the mud 
showed struggle. A groove in the clay 
revealed the final spasms of the man 
as he had kicked helplessly out, trying 
to free himself. Fannin’s handiwork? 

Bono pulled his earplugs out. He 
heard the tape again. He went in 
search of the transmitting source and 
found the recorder on a crate against 
the side of the bam. He kicked the 
crate. The sound died. 

So shall they die! 

Thunder in the distance, direction 
Ricardo. 

Storm over the Atlantic? 

To Bono’s left, high on the ridge, 
pine trees offered the shelter of deeper 
darkness. He ran across the clearing 
and up into the trees, and in their 
shadow half walked, half ran toward 
the camp. When he arrived on a level 
with the place, he crouched and 
looked down. The camp was dark, 
deserted. 

He puzzled over this state of affairs 
when he heard thunder again and this 
time clearly saw what appeared to be 
fireworks against the eastern sky. In a 
flash he understood everything: Why 
Fannin had acted, why the guard had 
not been relieved, why the camp lay 
so dark and empty, why it thundered 
without clouds. 

140 



The Great Change had come. 

As it was written, so it was. The 
Bastions of the Whore were crum- 
bling. 

He ran down into the camp. 

Bono sought two things: a weapon 
and a means of transport. He knew 
where Tack was. Tack would want a 
ringside seat at the spectacle. And 
where Tack was, there would be his 
structure whore. 

Like a man possessed, Bono ran 
from tent to tent. He picked up a hunt- 
ing knife but threw it away when he 
found an axe. He searched further, 
wishing for a pistol or rifle, something 
that could kill at a distance. He had to 
get through Tack’s guards before he 
could use this axe on Tack, a crude but 
effective emasculator. 

In the communications tent he saw 
coils of plast on the floor, exuded by 
one of the machines. He stopped and 
found a light. In its gleam he read the 
messages — a monotonous string of 
demands and threats from Proctor, 
who promised to launch Hydrogen 
through the air. 

Bono laughed. Death, destruction, 
obliteration, mayhem, pandemo- 
nioum, oblivion, doom. 

Yes, sir. Let the world go up with a 
bang. 

He ran on. 

At last, in a tent, hung on a pole, he 
saw a crossbow and stopped dead in 
his tracks. The weapon seemed to in- 
vite him to take it. It hung there, dark, 
oiled, menacing — as if placed by the 
Evil One for His obedient servant 
Bono. 

Bono took it down lovingly. He 
cranked back the bowstring. The 
weapon was in excellent shape. The 
wire was taut. It gleamed. He twanged 
it with a finger. It sang. He had what 

GALAXY 




he wanted. No weapon suited his 
fancy better. A full belt of murderous, 
blunt bolts hung next to the bow. 
Bono girded himself with it. 

Outside he soon found a clump of 
ponies, three animals. He had a 
long ride ahead, and he wanted 
spares. He didn’t bother to saddle the 
beasts. His fierce will alone would 
guide them without bridles. Moments 
later he was off. 

After an hour, the rythm of motion 
became hypnotic. The ponies 
steamed. Sweat-lather penetrated 
Bono’s tunic, dissolved the red clay, 
and discolored the horses’ flanks. The 
beasts snorted. Up ahead light flashed 
and thunder sounded. 

Later Ricardo appeared over the 
horizon. It was a brightness. It threw 
off showers of sparks, each spark a 
giant piece of plastosteel brought to 
brilliant incandescence by pres- 
sure — but at this distance but a fire- 
fly. 

Bono recalled another ride, an 
evening ride; he had been gloomy then 
and oppressed by a childhood mem- 
ory. Then, later, he had thrown off all 
that and had stepped out, a free man, 
in love with an indescribable dream of 
an inapproachable girl who had let 
him approach after all and then had 
treacherously left him for the bed of 
another until the story would end with 
her body engraved. He meant to dig 
her in with hands already used to tear- 
ing clay. Yes. 

He exulted with a joy of despair. 

Oh, God! Oh, wonderful, oh beauti- 
ful, oh tremendous, passionate Hate! 

How he longed to destroy, tear, 
rend, demolish, crush, sever, rip! 

Yes, yes. He’d bathe himself in 
gushes of blood. He’d breathe in the 
hot, steaming smell. He would smear 

HELIUM 



himself with blood. He’d wash in life* 
destroyed. 

Crack! Fireworks! Crack, crack, 
crack! A flower of fire. Higher, high- 
er! Explode! Disintegrate! 

Bono stopped his pony, rolled off, 
and mounted another. 

“Heeeey!” he cried, and they were 
off again. 

In the third hour he saw Ricardo 
clearly. Two of the five towers were 
mere stumps of blazing fire and 
smoke. Central Tower had begun to 
sag as well, and the others were in 
states of disintegration. The thunder 
was now a continuous noise and the 
fireworks a permanent feature of the 
sky — one burst renewed by another 
before it could die. 

In the brightness and noise, Bono 
didn’t notice another, much less spec- 
tacular but, from his perspective, 
much more interesting phenomenon 
until he was nearly upon it. 

Several Small Union airships 
maneuvered directly ahead of him. 
Bono saw the broken light-lines of 
tracer bullets aimed at the ground. 
Tiny explosions threw up dirt. But 
in contrast to the overwhelming 
noise of Ricardo’s break-up, these 
lesser sounds were inaudible. 

When he noticed the action, Bono 
froze. He realized that he had reached 
Tack’s temporary camp. He realized 
also that the airships, no doubt bound 
outward to hit Hinterland targets, had 
surprised Tack and now wrought de- 
struction. 

Bono shook an impotent first to- 
ward the ships. “They’re mine,’’ he 
screamed. He could barely hear his 
own voice. He spurred his pony 
ahead. 

Then the airships formed up and 
came his way, their work done. 



141 




Bono rolled off his pony and sought 
cover in the high mutagrass. The ships 
went over him — long, lighted cylin- 
drical tubes. 

He let them get away before he 
rose. The ponies had fled. The noise, 
the lights, the grav-vibes of the ships 
had chased them off now that Bono’s 
iron will no longer imposed itself on 
them. Bono continued on foot. He 
cranked back his bowstring again and 
put a bolt into the oiled slot. But he 
was sure he didn’t need a weapon any 
more. 

The temporary campsite was a 
place of carnage. Bodies lay all 
around, dead, dying. He went from 
man to man. They lay in a rough cir- 
cle. They had run out from a center to 
escape the ships. One by one Bono 
examined their faces. He knew most 
of the men. Some he didn’t recognize 
because they no longer had heads or 
faces. Among those still alive was 
Franco Dart. He lay on his face, and 
when Bono turned him with a boot, 
the old man’s eyes stared up in terror. 

“1 didn’t mean it, I didn’t want to 
do it, Barney. I swear. I meant no 
harm, don’t! Don’t you dare. Go 
away. I swear it — ” 

His voice abruptly ceased. 

Bono went on. 

He found Tack. Dead. For a long 
moment Bono stood over the blond 
giant. Tack was unmarked, but from 
his posture Bono inferred that Tack 
had broken his neck in a fall caused by 
an explosion. Or perhaps his spine had 
been cracked by shrapnel. The eyes 
were open and stared up. Empty eyes. 
They showed no emotion. Bono let 
the axe slip out of his fingers and went 
on. 

After some searching he found 
harem girls. He inspected each one 

142 



carefully by the light of Ricardo’s dis- 
integration. He didn’t find Regina, 
but he knew that she was here, some- 
where. He sensed it. The deep convic- 
tion excited him. Inadvertently he ex- 
perienced something akin to lust, the 
certainty of satisfaction, the 
breathlessness of approaching pas- 
sion. 

He carried out his search with bent 
head. All the people lay on the 
ground, and so his eyes were on the 
ground, seeking depressions in the tall 
mutagrass. At one point, however, he 
raised his head, thinking he saw a 
carry bird land, attracted by death. 
But his attention had been attracted by 
another kind of motion, a motion on 
the periphery of the ring of bodies — in 
fact beyond the ring. A figure. It came 
toward the ring. It was a white figure. 
He knew it was Her. 

Bono let out a murderous yell and 
ran toward her. He held the cross-bow 
at the ready. He was a hunter. She was 
the prey. This was the Plain of Baez. 
And a memory of a dream in a tub, a 
dream of hares and stinking gel. 

She ran in fright at his approach. He 
changed direction to intercept her. 
She zigged, like a hare. He zagged to 
prevent her escape. 

Bono knew he was near enough to 
kill her with a well-placed bolt, but he 
meant to confront her first. He meant 
to tell her who it was that stalked her, 
why it was that she must die and bathe 
his face and hands with blood. 

She wore a dress of some sort, a 
harem gown. Light blue or white. 
Maoling silk. The sparks of exploding 
Ricardo were caught in its sheen. The 
dress made it difficult for her to run, 
and she stumbled and fell. He stopped 
before her. She half crouched, half 
kneeled. Her eyes looked at him. 

GALAXY 




They were calm, open, strange. Then 
he saw recognition. 

“Mycal,” she cried, and she rose 
up — tall like a she-hare. Any second 
she would leap to the side. Oh, yes. 
Now was the moment to steel the heart 
against that onslaught of cloying 

pity — 

He raised the bow and took her in 
his sight. He aimed for her left nipple, 
a visible target even in the dark. 

“Mycal ,’ 5 she cried, “For God’s 
sake, I love you.” 

She held out a hand toward him. 

He knew the rules of the hunt. No 
hesitation. Let the index finger firmly 
curl around the trigger like a man’s 
arm around a woman’s waist. Let it 
squeeze calmly, without undue hurry. 
But though he knew the rules, Bono 
hesitated. Her tone stopped him. She 
had cried out her lie with total 
sincerity — and in a voice so changed 
and strange it didn’t sound like the 
Regina he knew. He took his eye from 
the sight, from her nipple, and 
glanced up at her face. No harm in 
that. After all, she was a woman, not a 
hare. She couldn’t leap out of his 
reach. 

Her face. 

It had a spot of sooty dirt beneath 
one eye. Her face was calm, serene, 
yet filled with a touching fondness. 
Bono felt a weakness in his stomach. 
No! He jerked his eye back to the 
sight, but it was too late. A question 
had formed in his mind, and he knew 
he’d have to ask it. 

He looked up again. 

“But why?” he cried. They were 
close to each other, but he had to shout 
in the constant noise. “Why did you 
do it?” 

“I had to,” she called back. 
“There was no other way. It was an 

HELIUM 



assignment.” 

Bono stared at her. Slowly the bow 
dropped down. Should he ask her 
another question? 

He still struggled inwardly when 
the world suddenly filled with light 
brighter than mid-day. It was a flash 
so intense it blinded him. Staging Sta- 
tion, came the unsolicited thought. 
Hydrogen. Then the blast sounded. A 
fierce air whistled past, sharp enough 
to cut. He dropped the bow and 
groped forward. Her seeking fingers 
encountered his. They rushed together 
and clung to each other as the shock 
wave picked them up and swept them 
away. 



ENCOUNTER 

The wind blew relentlessly, laden 
with dust. 

Sometimes it let up a little, and then 
particles of matter glinted in the at- 
mosphere and the landscape could be 
glimpsed — rolling country, lines of 
trees. At such times the column stop- 
ped with a collective sigh. People 
shook dust from their garments and 
scraped dust from their faces, rubbed 
dust from their hands. 

Miri did as the others. She walked 
in the center of the spearhead group, 
surrounded by women, children, and 
old men. Up front and bringing up the 
rear were young men, a kind of protec- 
tive guard. They were laughing and 
joking, happy to be freed for some 
hours from the burden of carrying 
gear. Horses! If only they had horses. 

Miri removed the cloth that pro- 
tected mouth and nose, wondering 
about the wind and what it carried. 
Dusted earth, yes. And tiny seeds of 
mutagrass. Maybe that. And broken 



143 




structures? Surely that too. And parti- 
cles of radioactive stuff? Yes, a little. 
Flower seeds? Certainly. The books 
had foretold that. 

You’re strong and resistant, she 
thought, addressing her child. The 
radiation can’t harm you, baby. 
You’re safe and sound in Mami. Don’ t 
you worry, little one. You’ll grow up 
healthy. The world will be full of flow- 
ers. The wind will settle. The dust will 
rain out of the sky. You just sleep and 
smile. 

A man on horseback approached 
from the distance, and though his face 
was obscured by cloth, she recognized 
Frenchy. He came near, embraced her 
lightly. By now she had accustomed 
herself to his strong odor. Ah, for a 
bath. 

“Everything all right?” 

She nodded, smiling. “We’re 
fine,” she said, meaning the baby and 
herself, but he didn’t catch her mean- 
ing. Excitement danced in his eyes. 

“I’m going on ahead,” he said. 
“One of our explorers has sighted 
another column. A large one, from 
what he reports.” 

She blew him a kiss as he re- 
mounted, happy with him. Frenchy 
forever sought more people, delighted 
each time he found some little pocket, 
be it tribal or structure. She watched 
him ride up a rise, the horse kicking 
dust. Then the wind began to gust 
again, and she covered her face. The 
column slowly got into motion again, 
going deeper into the interior. 

French rode forward at a trot. 
Mounted on the pony, his head was 
above the heavy sand and silt carried 
by the wind, but the finer particles 
were just as bad. 

That wind! It was the perennial sub- 
ject of thought and conversation. He 

144 



pondered its causes again and con- 
cluded, as he always did, that it must 
have been caused by the explosion of 
Union’s total arsenal over Hinterland. 
Shock waves, in combination, still 
travelled around the globe with undl- 
minished fury. There seemed nothing 
much left of either structure or Hinter- 
land, and if this dust kept obscuring 
the sun, there would be desert here in a 
few years. 

He rode on, trying to spy ahead 
through narrowed eyes. 

After a while, just above the 
shoulder-high rush of silt, he saw fig- 
ures moving. This was what the 
explorer had glimpsed, a long line of 
people, bundled up much like the folk 
of Exodus. And animals! By God, 
French thought he saw a herd of ani- 
mals revealed and then veiled again by 
a windgust. And the animals hadn’t 
been loaded. 

He yelled out, but in the wind noise 
he couldn’t have been heard. He dug 
heels into the horse’s flanks and made 
toward the tip of the column. 

As he came nearer, he noticed that a 
large group of people, yes, real 
people! — had settled down in the shel- 
ter of a small, low building. Others 
were still coming, and behind the first 
herd of horses he saw another. 

French yelled again, excited by the 
horses as much as the people. Two 
people detached themselves from the 
squatting clumps and came forward a 
ways — a man and a woman, faces 
thickly banded. 

French slid from his saddle and ran 
toward them. 

“Hello,” he cried. “More sur- 
vivors. Am I happy to see you people, 
where — ” 

He stopped abruptly, shocked by 
recognition. The man was Bono, the 

GALAXY 




woman Regina. French saw that-Bono 
also recognized him. 

And then, impelled by some kind of 
elemental gladness, the two men em- 
braced like long lost friends. They 
disengaged and laughed, slapped each 
other on the shoulders, laughed again. 
“You!” they cried, pointing at each 
other, and they laughed again. 

Later all four were settled in the 
shelter of the little hut, which turned 
out to be a compressor station. Once it 
had pumped Helium toward Ricardo. 
Miri and Regina sat to one side, dis- 
cussing the problems of maternity, 
Cult business, and the burdens of be- 
ing divine. 

The men sat on the other side and 
compared plans. Bono and his column 
were headed south. French and the 
Exodus west. Both had gathered fifty 
or sixty thousand. A census in this 
wind was impossible. Stragglers kept 

HELIUM 



joining. After a long set of pre- 
liminaries, Bono finally broached the 
subject very delicately, inquiring 
gently about the stores Exodus car- 
ried, and what items were in surplus 
and which in short supplies. French 
replied evasively and turned the ques- 
tion around. Oh, this and that, Bono 
said. Knives were in short supply, and 
now that the column lives on cricks, 
knives were important, but they were 
doing well enough without them. 
Hmmm, French said. Exodus just 
happened to have a goodly supply of 
cutting tools of all kinds. Matter of 
fact, he had almost abandoned several 
tons of tools because of a shortage of 
transport. Of course Exodus managed 
well enough without horses, but. 

“Perhaps we could do some busi- 
ness,” Bono said. 

“Perhaps we could,” French 
answered. *

Conroy introduced a whole 
hew dimension to 
study 



MAGMA 

WAVE 

1TH conroy, it was always 
something. I warned old Harcourt 
not to take him along on the Ice 
Age dig we were splicing with the 
Norwegians. 

Harcourt bristled his eyebrows at 
me. “Conroy is an excellent, field- 
trained photographer.” 

“There must be others. Try the 
Yellow Pages.” 

“What have you got against Con- 
roy? We’ll be exploring a cave cul- 
ture. Conroy could snap a black cat 
in a coal cellar at midnight with a 
box brownie.” 

“If Conroy was ever in a coal 
cellar at midnight, the other occu- 
pant would be a werewolf.” 

Harcourt blew his soup-strainer 
moustache at me. “What do you 
imagine you mean by that?” 

“The guy lives in another world 
and drags it around with him.” 

I felt Harcourt ought to remember 
that when you went anywhere with 



Conroy, you went in his space-time 
continuum, which might or might 
not coincide with everybody else’s. 

Like when we were uncovering 
pre-Inca trenches, down in Chim- 
bote. It rained. For the first time in 
several centuries. The fish-meal fac- 
tories along the Peruvian coast 
swam in a stinking soup. 

Mind you, in pre-Inca times the 
area had normal rainfall, and that 
was the continuum Conroy was in- 
habiting at the moment. He was so 
wrapped up in skull-trapanning that 
none of us dared admit we had a 
headache. 

We felt lucky to get out of it with 
only a cloudburst. 

Harcourt would not listen to my 
warning. He told me I was confus- 
ing coincidence with chaos and so 
the Museum shuffled Conroy home 
from the Middle East operations. 
When he got back to New York I 
did my best to talk him out of the 
Norwegian assignment. 

“It’s only an island with caves 
and bones and things, in the 
Skagerak,” I told him. “No 
blondes.” 

He turned his brooding eyes on 
me. “You realize it’s been only 
eleven thousand years since the area 
was glacial.” 

“Yeah. It seems like yesterday.” 

“Do you realize what you are 
saying?” 

Him and Harcourt. I tried again. 
“Look, Conroy, even in the middle 
of July the place is cold. Your 
lenses will fog. The iron deposits 



147 




will distort your meters. The film 
will get a layer of salt. You’ll have 
to eat boiled potatoes and fish 
heads.” 

“As usual, Giddings, you miss 
the point entirely; in 1813 the 
Skagerak froze solid between Nor- 
way and Denmark. 

“I guess I was doing something 
else that week. Conroy, you don’t 
need this job. You can pick and 
choose. Harcourt is all steamed up 
over a few scratches on a rock. Ten 
to one, nothing but doodling by 
Erik Bloody-Ax or Harald Blue- 
Tooth. I can take care of it with my 
new Polaroid.” 

A pitying look; “You don’t even 
know about the seaweed.” 

“I’m an anthropologist, not a 
horseshoe crab.” 

“I could make a crack, but I 
won’t,” he said. 

There was no talking him out of 
the trip. He, Harcourt and I loaded 
ourselves and Conroy’s cameras on 
a SAS jet to Bergen. We transferred 
to a local jet to Kristiansand and 
were met at the airport by the gov- 
ernment archeologist who was to 
see that we did not deface national 
property or get away with more 
than the agreed part of the artifacts. 

The archeologist was an all-right 
guy name of Nilsen. He gave us 
lunch at the Hotel Caledonian and 
escorted us to a dock where a large 
wooden launch was waiting, with a 
grizzled sea-character at the wheel. 

Harcourt had ordered local camp- 
ing equipment, and I would have 



taken Nilsen’s word that everything 
was aboard, but Harcourt had to 
climb into the launch and poke and 
pry, while Nilsen followed him with 
a notebook. 

I stood on the dock and absently 
watched passengers disembarking 
from the Denmark ferry. 

“Giddings!’’ barked Harcourt 
suddenly. “Where’s Conroy?” 

I broke off my research. Beside 
me were Conroy’s boxes and 
gadgets. No Conroy. 

“Harcourt, I told you,” I said in 
an aggrieved tone, “he lives in a 
parallel universe. He’s probably in 
the Hall of the Mountain King or 
someplace.” 

Nilsen looked past me and 
smiled, “Someplace they sell shoes, 
at least.” 

I turned and saw Conroy hurrying 
to the dock with a shopping bag 
labelled SKO in his fist. 

The grizzled character had al- 
ready cranked up the two-cylinder 
engine, so there was no time for 
questions. Conroy stepped into the 
launch, and I handed over his 
equipment. I cast off the mooring 
lines and hopped aboard. 

With the load we were carrying, 
there was not much free space. 
Harcourt and Nilsen found seats 
midships, at each side of the engine 
casing. Conroy and I sat on 
orange-colored packs under the lee 
of the focsle. 

“What the devil did you buy?” I 
asked him, as we chug-a-chugged 
out of the harbor. 



148 



GALAXY 




He opened the bag and showed 
me a pair of the heavy wooden 
scuffs that Norwegians clomp 
around in during the summer. 

“1 thought I’d better get these 
right away. This is a dangerous 
area.” 

“Yeah, the Russians are massing 
at the border. What are you going 
to do? Stomp them to death?” 

“Your priorities are wrong, Gid- 
dings. This area is more sensitive 
geologically than politically. The 
severe temperature variations could 
be catastrophic.” 

Here we went again. Bright July 
sunshine, a warm blue sea, and 
Conroy was already a disaster area. 

1 edged over the packs to Nilsen 
and asked him, “The larger harbors 
here are ice-free, aren’t they?” 
“Normally, yes,” he answered. 
“In hard winters they freeze. About 
ten years ago the sea was frozen 
five miles out. I myself drove a car 
to a light beacon seven kilometers 
from the coast. The ice was several 
feel thick, you know. Trucks and 
busses short-cut across the fjords all 
winter.” 

“Has the Skagerak ever frozen 
clear to Denmark?’ ’ 

“In the last century, several 
times. 1812 to 1815 were terrible 
years. The crops failed, and whole 
villages starved to death. They 
could not even fish, because the 
lakes and the sea were frozen solid 
to the bottom. When the freeze 
started, it came so fast that 
Skagerak fishermen had to leave

their boats in the ice and walk 
home.” 

So Conroy had not been putting 
me on. If 1812 to 1815 was going 
to be his time-space continuum, I 
should have brought ear muffs. On 
the other hand, he had not bought 
ice skates. He had bought wooden 
shoes. Why? 

Apparently it had something to 
do with seaweed. 

The island was a grass-and-tree 
oasis in a line of rocky skerries. On 
the inner side was a sand beach 
shelving gradually into quiet water. 
I was surprised when the boatman 
cut the motor and sheered away 
from this natural harbor. 

“Sea-grass,” explained Nilsen. 
“It’s choking everything this year. 
It hasn’t grown so thick since the 
mid-Thirties. The water was warm, 
back then. People went bathing un- 
til late September.” 

Severe temperature variations, 
Conroy had said. Catastrophic. 

We dropped the hook in deep wa- 
ter and eased up to a basalt hump 
fringed by flat-leafed seaweed so 
thick it was like a fender for the 
launch. We packed the supplies 



MAGMA WAVE 



149 





over the rocks, around the arm of 
the cove. I could look down into 
the gin-clear water and see the grass 
growing like long hairs from a 
scalp. 

Nilsen had already made a pre- 
liminary trip that morning and left a 
small plastic boat overturned on the 
beach. Underneath it were oars, an 
outboard motor, fuel cans and fish- 
ing gear. 

“You can’t work all the time,’’ 
he giinned, “and the mackerel are 
running.” 

This was my idea of international 
scientific co-operation. 

In less than an hour Nilsen and 
the boatman had helped us peg 
down a tent village at the edge of 
the beach. Nilsen indicated the 
emergency radio sender and said, 
“We’ll be back in a week. If you 
run into trouble when you break 
through that dirt passage, give us a 
call. A helicopter can be here in 
half an hour.” 

We thanked him, saw him and 
the boatman to the launch and 
watched it dwindle towards the 
coast. I suggested to Harcourt, 
“Maybe I ought to catch a mess of 
fish for supper, before dark.” 

He whoofed at me, “Fine. At 
this latitude it gets dark about Sep- 
tember.” 

So I had to go and inspect his 
cave. First, in the center of the is- 
land was a rune stone which Har- 
court dismissed with a brief, 
“Tenth century.” We were after 
older game. 



Beyond the rune stone was a fall- 
en tree. The wide shallow roots 
were tipped from the pot hole they 
had covered. We uncoiled a rope 
down the hole. I hung a flashlight 
on my belt and climbed down to the 
roomy cavern. 

I crunched on bones as I landed, 
and I swung the light around. These 
had been cannibals. The bones were 
split, the skulls hacked open. I 
noted the heavy longhead craniums 
and decided they would test-date 
2000 BC, before the roundheads 
came out of the southern forests. 

But we were after older game 
still. At the back of the cave was a 
strip of wall that was pounded dirt. 
Whoever had filled up the passage 
had partly obliterated carvings that 
apparently began in the main cave 
and ran into the passage. They were 
not runes. Until we had them 
brushed clean and photographed, we 
would not know what they were. 

Even Harcourt decided it was too 
late in the day to start on the pas- 
sage. I left him and Conroy lower- 
ing tripods and lights into the cave 
and went fishing. 

I rowed the boat through the 
slimy sea-grass, not wanting to use 
the outboard until I was clear. The 
mess snaked around the oars. As I 
reached out to untangle it, I felt 
how warm the water was, almost 
tropical. 

Free of the grass, I started the 
outboard and trailed a mackerel line 
alongside the boat. In no time at all 
I had six shiny beauties. Once again 



150 



GALAXY 




I oared my way through the grass 
and dragged the boat onto the 
beach . 

Harcourt and Conroy had already 
fried potatoes over the primus and 
set the coffee pot over a driftwood 
fire. So far, this space-time con- 
tinuum was not half bad. 

As we ate butter-browned mack- 
erel I asked Conroy, “Why the 
violent temperature swings in this 
neck of the woods?’’ 

He took a slurk of coffee and be- 
gan, “You see, Giddings, it’s not 
the sun that determines Scandina- 
vian climate. It’s the earth’s molten 
interior.” 

“What about the Gulf Stream?” 

“That’s a surface current, more 
or less constant. I could argue that 
it, too, is interior- warmed, but it is 
not relevant to the immediate ques- 
tion. When these harbors freeze 
over, it’s not because the Gulf 
Stream is out to lunch. It’s because 
the earth’s molten core has drained 
back.” 

I tried to imagine sea water freez- 
ing so fast that a fisherman had to 
leave his boat and walk home. 

As if reading my thoughts, Con- 
roy said, “When the Ice Ages 
came, it was Instant Freeze, you 
know. A mammoth stuffed a swatch 
of grass into his maw — and bingo, 
choice Bird’s Eye.” 

“But the sun must have been giv- 
ing heat,” I objected. 

“Yeah, and how much is that? 
At its best, barely enough to fry an 
egg on a New York pavement. We 



have central heating on this planet, 
Giddings. And nobody controls the 
thermostat. This year the magma is 
near the surface. The water is 
warm. The seaweed is growing to 
choking dimensions.” 

“It apparently grew that way in 
the Thirties and shrank back.” 

“Yes, but there’s no rule about 
its retreat or advance. The geology 
of these rocks says that the magma 
burst through to the surface many 
times. The Ice Ages are evidence 
that it also has retreated far into the 
earth, for reasons of its own. I sup- 
pose it’s sloshing back and forth 
under the whole world, but this 
seems to be one of the thin-skinned 
spots.” 

The next day we began to un- 
cover the passage, sifting each 
trowel of dirt and finding two flint- 
chipping tools, which got us excited 
because flint was not included in 
Norway’s rock ration — possibly on 
the theory that Norway had enough 
else. 

At any rate, the flint meant pre- 
historic trade, and we worked 
twelve hours with scarcely a break, 
until the passage was clear. 

It led only to another drop-off, so 
we quit work and went for a swim. 
The rock still had the day’s heat. I 
noticed gobs of sea grass floating 
on the water surface and did not 
want to row through it. I walked to 
the other side of the island and tried 
heaving a fishline beyond the flat 
weed. 

The lure was taken by a cod that 

151 



MAGMA WAVE 




fought like a whale. Once again we 
had a gourmet supper, but Conroy 
was brooding. 

“The grass is floating because 
the roots let go,” he said. “If you 
look, you’ll see the large round 
pockmarks in the sand.” 

“And you, of course, know why 
it let go?” 

“Of course. It got too warm. If 
somebody lit a fire under you, Gid- 
dings, I guess you’d float pretty 
fast, too.” 

We washed the dishes, hit the 
sack for a few hours and were up at 
the first full beams of a sun that had 
not entirely set. 

The warmth of the previous eve- 
ning seemed to linger, and the cool- 
ness of the first cavern felt good. 
We went through the passage to the 
drop-off and lowered a flashlight on 
a rope. 

The lower cave seemed filmed 
with white moisture. It was the 
gloss of what would have made 
stalagmites and stalactites if there 
had been more of it. We did not 
know about the air, so we lowered 
a lantern. The flame burned bright 
and flickered in air currents. 

Conroy wanted to work on the 
upper wall carving, so Harcourt and 
I climbed down to the new cave. 
Somebody had been there before us. 
Long, long before. He lay on the 
stone floor with a flint ax still in the 
back of his skull. 

He was a long-armed, rough- 
pelted monster. His forehead sloped 
back from prominent eye ridges. 



His mouth gaped shark-like. His 
chin receded into nothing. I esti- 
mated he must have stood eight feet 
tall on his horny feet. 

The skull was Neanderthal — but 
the height? 

“A folklore giant,” breathed 
Harcourt through his face fringe. 
“A troll. Beowulf s Grendel.” 

The monster had the same film as 
the cave. 1 touched a slippery hand. 
He was petrified, but there was no 
sign of previous decay. He had 
been whammed with the ax. He had 
been thrown into the lower cave and 
the passage closed. Then, Instant 
Freeze. 

After thirty thousand years — or 
maybe sixty thousand — the ice sheet 
had retreated. The upper cave had 
been used by cannibals too primi- 
tive to guess the significance of the 
dirt section of wall or the wall carv- 
ings. 

We moved Conroy and his 
equipment to the lower cave. We 
could only photograph our find. It 
would be up to Nilsen to decide to 
leave him there or pry him loose. 

Conroy paused, wiped his 
forehead and remarked, “You two 
haven’t noticed that we’re working 
up a sweat.” 

“Why shouldn’t we work up a 
sweat?” 

“In a ventilated cave less than 
fifty feet below the surface? This is 
no mile-deep South African mine.” 

Now that he mentioned it, the 
cave was stuffy. Even the plastic 
soles of my hiking shoes were stick- 



152 



GALAXY 




ing to the stone. 

For the first time, I noticed that 
Conroy was wearing his new 
wooden scuffs. Inch-thick insulation 
against heated rock. He followed 
my gaze and said sadly, “I told you 
this area was dangerous.” 

We climbed up to the first cave 
and took deep breaths of the cooler 
air. We continued to the surface. 
The day was warm, but the mossy 
dirt felt normal. 

“There’s no chop on the sea to- 
day,” I observed. “We can boat 
to the mainland and telephone 
Nilsen.” 

We walked out of the woods and 
onto the beach. The boat lay like a 
white plastic pancake on the sand. I 
took an involuntary step towards 
it — and hopped back as my shoe 
soles melted. 

The water was a brown mass of 
floating plants. 

“There’s no rule the magma has 
to retreat,” said Conroy. 

He walked over to the tents and 
came back with the emergency 
transmitter. It had been on top of a 
wooden crate and was presumably 
in working order. 

Conroy began cranking it. Har- 
court and I went back to the cooler 
woods. Harcourt said hopefully, 
“The helicopter can be here in half 
an hour.” 

“If it’s not too busy picking 
other people off volcanic hot 
spots.” 

“Other—?” 

“In Peru Conroy’s rain went 



along the whole coast.” 
“Conroy’s—?” 

“Of course, Conroy’s! Now he’s 
in another of his space-time con- 
tinua and has pulled us in with him! 
I told you, you should have left him 
in the Middle East where things are 
such a mess that not even Conroy 
could make them worse.” 

Harcourt considered. “Even if 
you’re right about Conroy, in Peru 
the rain stopped, eventually.” 
“Yeah, eventually.” 

Conroy had put the transmitter on 
a tree stump. The ground-moss un- 
der his wooden shoes was turning 
yellow. Harcourt and I climbed an 
oak tree. I could see dead fish float- 
ing belly-up in sea weed. The edges 
of the island had begun to steam. 

“We’re lucky this time, I said. 
“The magma was advancing. 
Otherwise, choice Bird’s Eye.” 

In a quarter hour the whirlybird 
lifted us off. That night the lava 
burst through the caves, and for a 
week the island smoked and 
steamed. Fortunately the volcanic 
activity was purely local. 

Conroy had rescued his films 
from the island. They developed out 
as superbly as Conroy’s films al- 
ways did. The Neanderthal monster 
made the cover of Time, and Con- 
roy was invited to dine with the 
Norwegian Royal Family. 

Harcourt and I returned to New 
York tourist-class on PanAm. 1 
mean, when it came to happy end- 
ings, we were definitely back in our 
usual continuum. ★

SINCE the writings of Jules Verne and 
H. G. Wells, science fiction— often 
termed “future fiction”— has fasci- 
nated alert minds. Not only has it 
entertained, it has predicted much of 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In GALAXY, the finest authors of 
the genre continue to speculate, to 
predict, to tackle the prime problems 
already shaping tomorrow. Ecology- 
space exploration— nuclear promise 
and threat— energy— social evolution 
and biological revolution— these and 
other fields are probed by imaginative 
stories uniquely exciting and reward- 
ing. So let your fancy run free. Sub-

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I have some comments on the February is- 
sue of Galaxy. First is the cover. The 
artwork used to be drab and lifeless but now, 
all I can say is — wow! The October IF for 
example had the best painting I’ve seen in a 
long time (by the way congratulate Colin 
Kapp on the excellent work he did on 
“Mephisto and the Ion Explorer”). 

‘‘The Annihilation of Ankgor Apeiron” by 
Fred Saberhagen was a clever story. I am 
beginning to like his beserker series. 

‘‘Allegiances” by Michael Bishop was the 
best story of that length since George R. R. 
Martin published A Song For Lya in one of 
the other magazines (the one, like you said, 
with rivets). Bishop is probably one of the 
best new writers and should receive a Hugo 
as such. 

‘‘Marsman Meets the Almighty” by Don 
Trotter was alright. 

‘‘The Linguist” by Tak Hallus, or Steve 
Robinette since he has decided to drop his 
pen name, was great. It combined a fascinat- 
ing idea with his always humorous style to 
create a masterpiece. (By the way “Pow- 
wow” last ish was superb also.) 

Sign of the Unicorn by Roger Zelazny just 
goes to show that Zelazny is amoung the top 
writers of our genre. 

Some other comments follow. 

I haven’t seen Interface yet. How about a 
‘coming next issue’ column? Some authors 
I’d like to see more of are Lany Niven, Clif- 
ford Simak, Harlan Ellison, Stephen Tall. 
[We, too. — Ed.] 

Congratulations on publishing the greatest 



magazine in the field of science fiction. 

Yours truly, 
Tony Trull

Thank you! 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I enjoyed the February issue of Galaxyllf 
very much. In the fiction department I 
thought that Michael Bishop’s “Allegiances” 
was the best because it touched upon an un- 
derlying theme that most Americans usually 
don’t even consider and does it realistically. 

Dr. Pournelle’s handling of the Vel- 
ikovsky Affair was the best I’ve seen on the 
subject so far. It was beautifully handled in a 
lucid level-headed manner as perhaps it was 
not in that “certain other magazine”. I espe- 
cially liked his treatment of certain scientists 
who tried to use Velikovsky’s own non- 
scientific methods. If Dr. Poumelle keeps up 
the good work we might have another Good 
Doctor on our hands. 

In conclusion I would like to add that I’m 
very sad to see If go under and I would like 
to know if the financial situation improves in 
time if //could would be revived?” 

Yours truly, 
Lonnie Misner

IF has suspended before, you know! 

Sirs: 

Concerning Jerry Pournelle’s article 
(ABM, Missile Eating Lasers And A Bi-polar 
World. Galaxy, March ’75); he makes one 
statement that I would like him to qualify. 
That statement is: 

“A few years ago a fanatic faction within 
a nation allied with the US actually plot- 
ted to trigger a US-SU war.” 

Although I hate to admit ignorance, I 
haven’t heard anything about it. Was it 
South Vietnam or one of our other Democ- 
racy loving subsidiary s? Do tell. Poumelle 
seems a little, well, optimistic. The people 
on top are just a little crazy; and, as Heinlein 



156 




said in a speech published in Analog, the 
people on top don’t want progress. Our John 
Cabal has yet to come. 

Sincerely, 
Jason Good row 

Dr. Poumelle is quite reticent on this sub- 
ject! 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I enjoyed Jerry Pournelle’s very thoughtful 
remarks on Velikovsky (Feb. 1975); I am 
especially glad that he got his priorities 
straight, concentrating on the historical and 
archaeological issues rather than on the 
backdrop of “scientific” theory ( cf . my own 
letter in Analog, Feb. 1975, p. 174). A cou- 
ple of points, however, deserve further 
comment. 

Dr. Poumelle mentions “maddening dis- 
crepancies in chronology”, writing that Vel- 
ikovsky ‘‘has correctly predicted that 
radiocarbon dating would show that certain 
artifacts of both the XVIII Dynasty and 
Pre-Columbian Central America would prove 
to be younger than expected.” Alas, this 
“prediction” should be relegated to the 
same category as the one about Linear B 
writing, and, as Asimov has explained, the 
one concerning the heat of Venus. The 
radiocarbon dates in question have been 
brought substantially into line with historical 
chronology as a result of comparative studies 
of carbon- 14 and tree-ring dates obtained 
from samples of the bristlecone pine (see for 
example R.M. Derricourt in the Journal of 
Near Eastern Studies, 1971; C. Renfrew in 
Scientific American, Oct. 1971; V.R. Swit- 
zur in Antiquity, 1973). As Renfrew points 
out, this realignment of C-14 dates has re- 
percussions in European prehistory. Al- 
together, it seems that the problem has been 
one of proper interpretation of the C-14 re- 
sults. 

As basic sources on ancient Egyptian and 
Near Eastern chronology, I recommend: 
W.C. Hayes, M.B. Rowton, F.H. Stubbings, 
“Chronology” (Revised Cambridge Ancient 
History, Vol. I, chap. 6); R.A. Parker, The 
Calendars of Ancient Egypt (Chicago 1950); 



R. Ehrich, ed.. Chronologies in Old World 
Archaeology (Chicago 1965). It should be 
noted that Egyptologists do not rely on Man- 
etho nearly as much as they did in the last 
century, when contemporary sources were 
not as well known. In fact, the 18th 
Dynasty, which is so well documented in the 
records of Egypt and in the international dip- 
lomatic correspondence of the ancient Near 
East, is rather garbled in the recensions of 
Manetho which have come down to us. 

Dr. Pournelle’s arguments establish most 
convincingly “that the Thera eruption, al- 
though locally devastating, was not a 
world-wide catastrophe.” One shudders to 
anticipate what some unborn Velikovsky 
three or four millennia hence will make of 
surviving records of Krakatoa, the San Fran- 
cisco Earthquake, the Chicago Fire, and the 
devastation of two World Wars — a Ragnarok 
indeed! Unfortunately, Poumelle seems to be 
leaning in the direction of the same sort of 
deus ex machina approach to historical 
events with his “wild guess” about the 
meteor strike — which I am eager to see more 
fully elaborated in a future issue of your 
magazine. 

Sincerely yours,

The bristlecone pine corrections to radiocar- 
bon dating have certainly taken the dis- 
crepancies out of the range Velikovsky ‘ 'pre- 
dicted”, but I’m not convinced they’ve re- 
solved all the problems with conventional 
dating. Mrs. Vronwy Hankey has been kind 
enough to send me her “ Absolute Chronol- 
ogy of the Aegean Bronze Age”, and be- 
lieves she has resolved most key events 
within ± 25 years, but / fear I harbor a few 
misgivings still. 

The chronology arguments center to some 
extent around an astronomical event known 
as a heliacal rising of Sothis. 

There’s some question about which star 
the Egyptians called Sothis (although the 



157 




vast majority of experts believe it’s Sirius, 
and so would l were there not a report by a 
reliable observer that Sirius is “blood red"). 
There’s even more question about the 
latitude at which the observation was made, 
and this is a key problem since it determines 
the date. 

My wild guess about Phaeton should be in 
this column sometime next fall. 

Jerry Pournelle 

Mr. Baen, 

Concerning your March Issue: 

I applaud the attitude expressed in your 
editorial. Actually, I have enjoyed your mag 
because it is primarily filled with up-tone 
stories. 

And yet you included a very depressing 
piece, “Changelings”, which I did not enjoy 
at all. 

Spider Robinson’s story did not have a 
pleasant ending, yet neither was it emotion- 
ally oppressive. He is a very fine writer and 
by dint of this I enjoyed his story. Chilling 
and cohesive. Very good. 

Another goodie was “Politics of Rat- 
ticide”. What an off-beat, funny story! I 
loved it. 

“Tree of Life” was enjoyable. 

But the real reason I sat down to write is 
the Zelazny serial. It is phenomenal and I 
was excitedly looking forward to the conclu- 
sion. After all, in the Feb. issue it was tag- 
ged a three-parter. 

So I’m reading along a thousand miles a 
minute and I come to page 112 and there is 
no more story! A zillion questions un- 
answered and no real ending, not even your 
little *, which heralds “the end”. I mean, 
what happened? Don’t tell me that was the 
end or I’ll go stark raving bananas!!

A good meal will generally contain a bit of 
pepper and a little vinegar — for flavor. As 
for SIGN OF THE UNICORN, that was Part 
III of III — of an open-ended series. (The star 
was missing due to a typesetting mishap.) But 



be of good cheer; Roger says he has almost 
finished the fourth Amber novel, and with a 
little encouragement from the Readership, I just 
might be persuaded to publish that one too! 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I, like you, have hopes for the future of 
mankind. 

We are big enough to do anything we 
want to do badly enough. 

Here is our dilemma: So many shouts are 
heard against scientists and technology. So 
many cries of doom ring out. 

I believe we must take some risks for the 
good of all. Nothing we have ever ac- 
complished to the good has been without 
risks or mistakes or danger, including the 
founding of this nation. 

I can only write this letter to you today 
because of the miracle of penicillin. I would 
not have survived my first year of life with- 
out it. 

We are a nation that has permitted our- 
selves to become too depressed. 

But, I know that somewhere in our hearts 
and minds, our great warm and humorous 
spirit still eixists. 

Let us return to our dreams and hopes and 
yes, our miracles. 

Let us show our children that we are made 
of the same stern and noble blood as our 
Founding Fathers. 

Let us strive to give our children new 
dreams to dream and new frontiers to brave. 
But more than that, let us strive to give them 
examples of courage, fine character, 
backbone and deep humanity. 

Sincerely, 
Mrs. Sandra McNabb

But let’s also keep in mind just how fragile a 
thing is our planet’s biosphere — and how 
gently we must treat it. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Concerning Jerry Pournelle ’s Velikovsky 
article in the February 1975 Galaxy Hf : There 
is no need for a giant meteor strike in the 



158 



GALAXY 




Mediterranean. Rhys Carpenter’s Discoun- 
tinuity Of Greek Civilization (w.w. Norton, 
N.Y., 1968) presents a more than adequate 
climatological explanation which fits not 
only Greek discontinuity but also late Roman 
ones. In addition certain facts usually found 
only by delvers into oceanography (biophysi- 
cal) support Carpenter’s thesis (the facts 
‘fit’). I know this sounds awfully general — 
needfully so since the data is in books of 
material and final ‘proof’ in yet-to-be-done 
computer studies and collation of data (his- 
torical, meteorological, ‘biological’). How- 
ever, it is a directive to those who are in- 
terested in what may be the facts of our his- 
tory! 

I have some further input on the issue 
however. I agree with much of what ‘Alter’ 
has to say. Perhaps it’s my long (13 yrs.) 
habitation of the ‘rivet’ shop across the 
newsstand, but some of what you publish 
does seem pretentious (“A Horse Of A Dif- 
ferent Technicolor”, previous issue), over- 
done and almost plotless (‘‘Straw”) and so 
obviously ‘social-idea-prone’ (‘‘Be Ye Per- 
fect”) that Geis’ words ring true and rever- 
berate. Of course there are good and even 
captivating stories (‘Sign Of The Unicom’) 
and the ‘rivets’, too, show signs of yielding 
to the pressures of including minority charac- 
ters and overdone philosophy where it’s not 
necessary to the story. Still it would be nice 
if the College English classes were left in the 
classrooms. 

Sincerely 
Bill March 

Does a minority character have to be 
“necessary to the plot"?! ( Jerry’s reply fol- 
lows.) 

I’m familiar with Carpenter’ s thesis, of 
course. It isn’t universally accepted, and 
even if it were, his view that a massive cli- 
mate change caused the Dark Ages does not 
finish the job. 

What caused the climate change? In the 
year 1814, Tamboura blew off with some- 
what less energy and considerably less atten- 
tion than Krakatoa somewhat later in the

century. Yet 1815 was known as ‘ ‘the year 
without a summer ” because the particulates 
ejected by the volcano actually changed the 
albedo of Earth. Less sunlight penetrated, 
less energy to evaporate water, less sun- 
shine, etc. 

It’s postulated that a really large meteor, 
as I suppose Phaeton to have been (and re- 
call that this is no more than a guess, an 
hypothesis, a debating point; I have no wish 
to start a new school of archeology ) would 



have quite an effect on climate. 

Pomerance of the Archeological Institute 
of America gives some convincing arguments 
against the simple barbarian migration 
theory that’s generally accepted as the cause 
of the Dark Ages. Phaeton could have soft- 
ened up the civilizations with tsunamis, 
changed the climates to weaken them further, 
and set the barbarians in motion as Car- 
penter suggests.
