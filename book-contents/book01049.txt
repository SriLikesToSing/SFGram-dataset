TT DOESN’T seem very long 
ago that detective stories be- 
came legitimate when Roosevelt 
declared in an interview that he 
read them for relaxation. Those 
of us who were then reading and 
writing science fiction were envi- 
ous. We hop>ed something similar 
would happen to our favorite 
form of literature, but we didn’t 
really expect it. 

There was Aldous Huxley’s 
Brave New World, of course, 
which appeared around that time 
and was a huge hit; we were able 
to explain to the uninitiated that 
we read and wrote stories like 
that. But I remember being 
backed into describing the plot of 
a story I was working on then: 
“Well, there are giant brains 
sealed in glassite capsules in the 
polar ice. They belong to extra- 
terrestrials, who have no bodies, 
just brains, and they know every- 
thing that happened on Earth be- 
cause they’re immortal — ” The ex- 
perience inhibited me so badly 
that I never wrote the story. 

A lot has happened to science 
fiction since that wild era, when 
no author could get up from his 



typewriter without having 
knocked off at least some part of 
the Solar System’s population. 

Craftsmanship had to enter the 
field. There are only so many 
basic categories; when they have 
been done over and over, espe- 
cially with primal motivations 
and masses of people instead of 
individuals and their infinitely 
varied problems and conflicts, the 
result must be ultimate stasis. 

Those writers who could not 
learn to construct a real story had 
to drop out, for their stuff inevi- 
tably was too similar to things 
that had been done before, by 
others and even by themselves. 
Meeting them now, I find it sad- 
dening to hear their puzzled or 
hostile remarks about science fic- 
tion. 

Many of them understand it 
less than if they had never writ- 
ten any. 

(The same is true of the eld- 
erly fans who can’t realize that 
the “sense of wonder” they bay 
for is gone from them, not from 
science fiction.) 

I wonder if anyone else then 
had an experience like mine: 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



When I was about 18, I kept 
bringing stories to a wonderful 
old editor named Dr. T. O’Con- 
nor Sloane, and he, instead of 
talking about them, always man- 
aged to get off onto Icelandic lit- 
erature, the fascination of mathe- 
matics (a specialty of his'), and 
other subjects that may not have 
been evasions, but were just as 
good. 

One story I gave him, how- 
ever, got him dangerously excited 
for a man of 82. It was about 
mining on Venus and I’d man- 
fully exposed the dirty rats who 
savagely exploited native labor 
and prisoners exiled to that miser- 
ably hot, rainy planet. Dr. Sloane 
exclaimed it was too good for his 
pulp magazine and brought both 
me and the manuscript up to the 
Delineator, which was owned by 
the same company. The story 
came back to me with a printed 
rejection slip. Not long after, the 
Delineator folded. I immediately 
saw the connection, but I was 
more concerned with selling the 
story. Dr. Sloane, though, went on 
maintaining that it was too good 
and steadfastly refused to buy it. 

If that experience is typical, it 
explains a good deal about the 
dreadfulness of that paleolithic 
science fiction. (I don’t know 
how much better my own story 
was, because it somehow got lost.) 

Were I an envious man, which 
I am, I would resent the break 



that authors have today in rates 
and markets. There were very few 
science fiction magazines, their 
rates ranging from microscopic 
fractions of a cent payable upon 
lawsuit to just enough to starve 
on. Hardly any book publishers 
brought out science fiction books. 
No anthologies, no px>cketbooks, 
no TV, radio or move resale. 

Good God, no wonder a depres- 
sion was going on! 

No doubt there is a lesson to 
be derived from this. Writing sci- 
ence fiction in the early days was 
easier, but the pay was pKXjr. 
Writing for Galaxy is very much 
harder, but the pay is highly re- 
warding both in amount and pres- 
tige. 

I guess it balances out Either 
way, writing — esp>ecially the writ- 
ing of science fiction — is not a job 
for the lazy. A good story gives 
the illusion of having been pro- 
duced effortlessly. Nothing in- 
volves more effort than achieving 
that illusion, however. 

A ll the foregoing is excerpted 
from my introduction to the 
First Galaxy Reader, written over 
five years ago. (It’s still available 
from us at $2.75 postpaid — a 
giant book of 600 pages.) As I 
said in concluding the introduc- 
tion: I just thought you’d be in- 
terested in one practitioner’s per- 
sonal history in science fiction.

The 

Ignoble 

Savages 

By EVELYN E. SMITH 



Snaddra had but one choice in its fight to 
afford to live belowground— underhandedly 
pretend theirs was an aboveboard societyl 

Illustrated by DILLON 




G O AWAY from me, 
Skkiru,” Larhgan 
said, pushing his hand 
off her arm. “A beggar does not 
associate with the high priestess 
of Snaddra.” 

“But the Earthmen aren’t due 
for another fifteen minutes,” 
Skkiru protested. 



“Of what importance are fif- 
teen minutes compared to eter- 
nity!” she exclaimed. Her lovely 
eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. 
“You don’t seem to realize, Skkiru, 
that this isn’t just a matter of 
minutes or hours. It’s forever.” 
“Forever!” He looked at her in- 
credulously. “You mean we’re go-

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ing to keep this up as a perma- 
nent thing? You’re joking!” 

Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru 
didn’t care about that. The sad, 
sweet way Larhgan shook her 
beautiful head disturbed him 
much more, and when she said, 
“No, Skkiru, I am not joking,” a 
tiny pang of doubt and apprehen- 



sion began to quiver in his second 
smallest left toe. 

“This is, in effect, good-by,” she 
continued. “We shall see each 
other again, of course, but only 
from a distance. On feast days, 
perhaps you may be permitted to 
kiss the hem of my robe . but 
that will be all.” 



THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES

Skkiru turned to the third per- 
son present in the council cham- 
ber. “Bbulas, this is your fault! 
It was all your idea!” 

There was regret on the Dilet- 
tante’s thin face — an obviously 
insincere regret, the younger man 
knew, since he was well aware 
how Bbulas had always felt about 
the girl. 

“I am sorry, Skkiru,” Bbulas 
intoned. “I had fancied you un- 
derstood. This is not a game we 
are playing, but a new way of life 
we are adopting. A necessary way 
of life, if we of Snaddra are to 
keep on living at all.” 

“It’s not that I don’t love you, 
Skkiru,” Larhgan put in gently, 
“but the welfare of our planet 
comes first.” 

S HE had been seeing too many 
of the Terrestrial fictapes 
from the library, Skkiru thought 
resentfully. There was too damn 
much Terran influence on this 
planet. And this new project was 
the last straw. 

No longer able to control his 
rage and grief, he turned a triple 
somersault in the air with rage. 
“Then why was I made a beggar 
and she the high priestass? You 
arranged that purposely, Bbulas. 
You 

“Now, Skkiru,” Bbulas said 
wearily, for they had been through 
all this before, “you know that all 
the ranks and positions were dis- 

8 



tributed by impartial lot, except 
for mine, and, of course, such jobs 
as could carry over from the 
civilized into the primitive.” 

Bbulas breathed on the spec- 
tacles he was wearing, as contact 
lenses were not considered back- 
ward enough for the kind of 
planet Snaddra was now sup- 
posed to be, and attempted to 
wipe them dry on his robe. How- 
ever, the thick, jewel-studded em- 
broidery got in his way and so he 
was forced to lift the robe and 
wipe all three of the lenses on the 
smooth, soft, spun metal of his 
top underskirt. 

“After all,” he went on speak- 
ing as he wiped, “I have to be 
high priest, since I organized this 
culture and am the only one here 
qualified to administer it. And, as 
the president himself concurred 
in these arrangements, I hardly 
think you — a mere private citi- 
zen— have the right to question 
them.” 

“Just because you went to 
school in another solar system,” 
Skkiru said, whirling with anger, 
“you think you’re so smart!” 

“I won’t deny that I do have 
educational and cultural advan- 
tages which were, unfortunately, 
not available to the general popu- 
lace of this planet. However, even 
under the old system, I was al- 
ways glad to utilize my superior 
attainments as Official Dilettante 
for the good of all and now — ” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Sure, glad to have a chance to 
rig this whole setup so you could 
break up things between Larhgan 
and me. You’ve had your eye on 
her for some time.” 

Skkiru coiled his antennae at 
Bbulas, hoping the insult would 
provoke him into an unbecoming 
whirl, but the Dilettante re- 
mained calm. One of the chief 
outward signs of Terran-type 
training was self-control and 
Bbulas had been thoroughly ter- 
ranized. 

1 hate Terrestrials, Skkiru said 
to himself. I hate Terra. The 
quiver of anxiety had risen up his 
leg and was coiling and uncoiling 
in his stomach. He hoped it 
wouldn’t reach his antennae — if 
he were to break down and psonk 
in front of Larhgan, it would be 
the final humiliation. 

“Skkiru!” the girl exclaimed, ro- 
tating gently, for she, like her 
fiance — her erstwhile fiance, that 
was, for the new regime had 
caused all such ties to be severed 
— and every other literate person 
on the planet, had received her 
education at the local university. 
Although sound, the school was 
admittedly provincial in outlook 
and very poor in the emotional 
department. “One would almost 
think that the lots had some sort 
of divine intelligence behind 
them, because you certainly are 
behaving in a beggarly manner!” 

“And I have already explained 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



to you, Skkiru,” Bbulas said, with 
a patience much more infuriating 
than the girl’s anger, “that I had 
no idea of who was to become my 
high priestess. The lots chose 
Larhgan. It is, as the E^rthmen 
say, kismet.” 

TTE ADJUSTED the fall of his 
glittering robe before the 
great polished four-dimensional 
reflector that formed one wall of 
the chamber. 

Kismet, Skkiru muttered to 
himself, and a little sleight of 
hand. But he didn’t dare offer 
this conclusion aloud; the libel 
laws of Snaddra were very severe. 
So he had to fall back on a weak, 
“And I suppose it is kismet that 
makes us all have to go live out 
on the ground during the day, 
like — like savages.” 

“It is necessary,” Bbulas re- 
plied without turning. 

“Pooh,” Skkiru said. “Pooh, 
pooh, POOH!” 

Larhgan’s dainty earflaps 
closed. “Skkiru! Such language!” 
“As you said,” Bbulas mur- 
mured, contemptuously coiling 
one antenna at Skkiru, “the lots 
chose well and if you touch me, 
Skkiru, we shall have another 
drawing for beggar and you will 
be made a metal-worker.” 

“But I can’t work metal!” 
“Then that will make it much 
worse for you than for the other 
outcasts,” Bbulas said smugly, 

9 



“because you will be a pariah 
without a trade.” 

“Speaking of pariahs, that re- 
minds me, Skkiru, before I forget, 
I’d better give you back your 
grimpatch — ” Larhgan handed the 
glittering bauble to him — “and 
you give me mine. Since we can’t 
be betrothed any longer, you 
might want to give yours to some 
nice beggar girl.” 

“I don’t want to give my grim- 
patch to some nice beggar girl!” 
Skkiru yelled, twirling madly in 
the air. 

“As for me,” she sighed, stand- 
ing soulfully on her head, “I do 
not think I shall ever marry, I 
shall make the religious life my 
career. Are there going to be 
any saints in your mythos, 
Bbulas?” 

“Even if there will be,” Bbulas 
said, “you certainly won’t qualify 
if you keep putting yourself into 
a position which not only repre- 
sents a trait wholly out of keep- 
ing with the new culture, but is 
most unseemly with the high 
priestess’s robes.” 

Larhgan ignored his unfeeling 
observations. “I shall set myself 
ap>art from mundane affairs,” she 
vowed, “and I shall pretend to be 
happy, even though my heart will 
be breaking.” 

It was only at that moment 
that Skkiru realized just how out- 
rageous the whole thing really 
was. There must be another solu- 

10 



tion to the planet’s problem. “Lis- 
ten—” he began, but just then 
excited noises filtered down from 
overhead. It was too late. 

“Earth ship in view!” a squeaky 
voice called through the inter- 
com. “Everybody topside and 
don’t forget your shoes.” 

Except the beggar. Beggars 
went barefoot. Beggars suffered. 
Bbulas had made him beggar pur- 
posely, and the lots were a lot of 
slibwash. 

“Hurry up, Skkiru.” 

TJBULAS slid the ornate head- 
dress over his antennae, 
which, already gilded and jeweled, 
at once seemed to become a part 
of it. He looked pretty damn 
silly, Skkiru thought, at the same 
time conscious of his own ap- 
pearance — which was, although 
picturesque enough to delight ro- 
mantic Terrestrial hearts, suffi- 
ciently wretched to charm the 
most hardened sadist. 

“Hurry up, Skkiru,” Bbulas 
said. “They mustn’t suspect the 
existence of the city underground 
or we’re finished before we’ve 
started.” 

“For my part, I wish we’d never 
started,” Skkiru grumbled. “What 
was wrong with our old culture, 
anyway?” 

That was intended as a rhetori- 
cal question, but Bbulas answered 
it anyway. He always answered 
questions; it had never seemed to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



penetrate his mind that school- 
days were long since over. 

“Fve told you a thousand times 
that our old culture was too much 
like the Terrans’ own to be of in- 
terest to them,” he said, with af- 
fected weariness. “After all, most 
civilized societies are basically 
similar; it is only primitive soci- 
eties that differ sharply, one from 
the other — and we have to be 
different to attract Earthmen. 
They’re pretty choosy. You’ve got 
to give them what they want, and 
that’s what they want. Now take 
up your post on the edge of the 
field, try to look hungry, and re- 
member this isn’t for you or for 
me, but for Snaddra.” 

“For Snaddra,” Larhgan said, 
placing her hand over her ante- 
rior heart in a gesture which, 
though devout on Earth — or so 
the fictapes seemed to indicate — 
was obscene on Snaddra, owing to 
the fact that certain essential or- 
gans were located in different 
areas in the Snaddrath than in 
the corresponding Terrestrial life- 
form. Already the Terrestrial in- 
fluence was corrupting her, Skkiru 
thought mournfully. She had been 
such a nice girl, too. 

“We may never meet on equal 
terms again, Skkiru,” she told 
him, with a long, soulful glance 
that made his hearts sink down to 
his quivering toes, “but I promise 
you there will never be anyone 
else for me — and I hope that 



knowledge will inspire you to 
complete cooperation with 
Bbulas.” 

“If that doesn’t,” Bbulas said, 
“I have other methods of inspi- 
ration.” 

“All right,” Skkiru answered 
sulkily. “I’ll go to the edge of the 
field, and I’ll speak broken Inter- 
galactic, and I’ll forsake my nor- 
mal habits and customs, and I’ll 
even beg. But I don’t have to like 
doing it, and I don’t intend to like 
doing it.” 

All three of Larhgan’s eyes 
fuzzed with emotion. “I’m proud 
of you, Skkiru,” she said brokenly. 

Bbulas sniffed. The three of 
them floated up to ground level 
in a triple silence. 

A LMS, for the love of Ip- 
snadd,” Skkiru chanted, as 
the two Terrans descended from 
the ship and plowed their way 
through the mud to meet a pro- 
cession of young Snaddrath 
dressed in elaborate ceremonial 
costumes, and singing a popular 
ballad — to which less ribald, as 
well as less inspiring, words than 
the originals had been fitted by 
Bbulas, just in case, by some ex- 
tremely remote chance, the Ter- 
rans had acquired a smattering of 
Snadd somewhere. Since neither 
party was accustomed to navigat- 
ing mud, their progress was al- 
mostt imperceptible. 

“Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,” 



THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES

chanted Skkiru the beggar. His 
teeth chattered as he spoke, for 
the rags he wore had been cus- 
tom-weatherbeaten for him by 
the planet’s best tailor —now a 
pariah, of course, because Snadd 
tailors were, naturally, metal- 
workers— and the wind and the 
rain were joyously making their 
way through the demolished 
wires. Never before had Skkiru 
been on the surface of the planet, 
except to pass over, and he had 
actually touched it only when tak- 
ing off and landing. The Snadd- 
rath had no means of land trans- 
port, having previously found it 
imnecessary — but now both air- 
cars and self-levitation were on 
the prohibited list as being insuf- 
ficiently primitive. 

The outside was no place for 
a civilized human being, particu- 
larly in the wet season or — more 
properly speaking on Snaddra — 
the wetter season. Skkiru’s feet 
were soaked with mud; not that 
the light sandals worn by the 
members of the procession ap- 
peared to be doing them much 
good, either. It gave him a kind of 
melancholy pleasure to see that 
the privileged ones were likewise 
trying to repress shivers. Though 
their costumes were rich, they 
were also scanty, particularly in 
the case of the females, for Earth- 
men had been reported by tape 
and tale to be humanoid. 

As the mud clutched his toes. 



Skkiru remembered an idea he 
had once gotten from an old 
sporting fictape of Terrestrial ori- 
gin and had always planned to 
experiment with, but had never 
gotten aroimd to — the weather 
had always been so weathery, 
there were so many other more 
comfortable sports, Larhgan had 
wanted him to spend more of his 
leisure hours with her, and so on. 
However, he still had the equip- 
ment, which he’d salvaged from a 
wrecked air-car, in his apartment 
—and it was the matter of a mo- 
ment to run down, while Bbulas 
was looking the other way, and 
get it. 

Bbulas couldn’t really object, 
Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver 
in his toe, because what could be 
more primitive than any form of 
land transport? And even though 
it took time to get the things, they 
worked so well that, in spite of the 
procession’s head start, he was at 
the Earth ship long before the 
official greeters had reached it. 

^ I 'HE newcomers were indeed 
humanoid, he saw. Only the 
peculiarly pasty color of their 
skins and their embarrassing lack 
of antennae distinguished them 
visibly from the Snaddrath. They 
were dressed much as the Snadd- 
rath had been before they had 
adopted primitive garb. 

In fact, the Terrestrials were 
quite decent-looking life-forms. 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



entirely different from the foppish 
monsters Skkiru had somehow ex- 
pected to represent the cultural 
ruling race. Of course, he had fre- 
quently seen pictures of them, but 
everyone knew how easily those 
could be retouched. Why, it was 
the Terrestrials themselves, he 
had always understood, who had 
invented the art of retouching — 
thus proving beyond a doubt that 
they had something to hide. 

“Look, Raoul,” the older of the 
two Earthmen said in Terran — 
which the Snaddrath were not, ac- 
cording to the master plan, sup- 
posed to understand, but which 
most of them did, for it was the 
fashionable third language on 
most of the outer planets. “A beg- 
gar. Haven’t seen one since some 
other chaps and I were doing a 
spot of field work on that little 
planet in the Arcturus system — 
what was its name? Glotch, that’s 
it. Very short study, it turned out 
to be. Couldn’t get more than a 
pamphlet out of it, as we were un- 
able to stay long enough to amass 
enough material for a really de- 
finitive work. The natives tried to 
eat us, so we had to leave in 
somewhat of a hurry.” 

“Oh, they were cannibals?” the 
other Earthman asked, so respect- 
fully that it was easy to deduce 
he was the subordinate of the 
two. “How horrible!” 

“No, not at all,” the other as- 
sured him. “They weren’t human 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



— another species entirely — so 
you could hardly call it canni- 
balism. In fact, it was quite all 
right from the ethical standpoint, 
but abstract moral considerations 
seemed less important to us than 
self-preservation just then. De- 
cided that, in this case, it would 
be best to let the missionaries get 
first crack at them. Soften them 
up, you know.” 

“And the missionaries — did 
they soften them up, Cyril?” 

“They softened up the mission- 
aries, I believe.” Cyril laughed. 
“Ah, well, it’s all in the day’s 
work.” 

“I hope these creatures are not 
man-eaters,” Raoul commented, 
with a polite smile at Cyril and 
an apprehensive glance at the on- 
coming procession — creatures in- 
deed! Skirru thought, with a men- 
tal sniff. “We have come such a 
long and expensive way to study 
them that it would be indeed a 
pity if we also were forced to de- 
part in haste. Especially since this 
is my first field trip and I would 
like to make good at it.” 

“Oh, you will, my boy, you 
will.” Cyril clappied the younger 
man on the shoulder. “I have 
every confidence in your ability.” 

Either he was stupid, Skkiru 
thought, or he was lying, in spite 
of Bbulas’ asseverations that un- 
truth was unknown to Terrestri- 
als — which had always seemed 
highly improbable, anyway. How 

13 



could any intelligent life-form 
possibly stick to the truth all the 
time? It wasn’t human; it wasn’t 
even humanoid; it wasn’t even 
polite. 

“The natives certainly appear 
to be human enough,” Raoul 
added, with an appreciative 
glance at the females, who had 
been selected for the processional 
honor with a view to reported 
Terrestrial tastes. “Some slight 
differences, of course — but, if two 
eyes are beautiful, three eyes can 
be fifty per cent lovelier, and 
chartreuse has always been my 
favorite color.” 

If they stand out here in the 
cold much longer, they are going 
to turn bright yellow. His own 
skin, Skkiru knew, had faded 
from its normal healthy emerald 
to a sickly celadon. 

/^YRIL frowned and his com- 
^ p>anion’s smile vanished, as if 
the contortion of his superior’s 
face had activated a circuit some- 
where. Maybe the little one’s a 
robot! However, it couldn’t be — 
a robot would be better con- 
structed and less interested in fe- 
males than Raoul. 

“Remember,” Cyril said sternly, 
“we must not establish undue 
rapport with the native females. 
It tends to detract from true ob- 
jectivity.” 

“Yes, Cyril,” Raoul said meekly. 

Cyril assumed a more cheerful 

14 



aspect “I should like to give this 
chap something for old times’ 
sake. What do you suppose is the 
medium of exchange here?” 

Money, Skirru said to himself, 
but he didn’t dare contribute this 
piece of information, helpful 
though it would be. 

“How should I know?” Raoul 
shrugged. 

“Empathize. Get in there, old 
chap, and start batting.” 

“Why not give him a bar of 
chocolate, then?” Raoul suggested 
grxunpily. “The language of the 
stomach, like the language of 
love, is said to be a universal 
one.” 

“Splendid idea! I always knew 
you had it in you, Raoul!” 

Skkiru accepted the candy with 
suitable — and entirely genuine — 
murmiirs of gratitude. Chocolate 
was found only in the most ex- 
pensive of the planet’s delicacy 
shops — and now neither delicacy 
shops nor chocolate were to be 
found, so, if Bbulas thought he 
was going to save the gift to con- 
tribute it later to the Treasury, 
the “high priest” was off his 
rocker. 

To make sure there would be 
no subsequent dispute about p)Os- 
session, Skkiru ate the candy then 
and there. Chocolate increased 
the body’s resistance to weather, 
and never before had he had to 
endure so much weather all at 
once. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



On Earth, he had heard, where 
people lived expwsed to weather, 
they often sickened of it and 
passed on — which helped to solve 
the problem of birth control on 
so vulgarly fecund a planet. 
Snaddra, alas, needed no such 
measures, for its population — like 
its natural resources — was dwin- 
dling rapidly. Still, Skkiru 
thought, as he moodily munched 
on the chocolate, it would have 
been better to flicker out on their 
own than to descend to a subter- 
fuge like this for nothing more 
than survival. 

"OEING a beggar, Skkiru 
^ discovered, did give him 
certain small, momentary advan- 
tages over those who had been al- 
loted higher ranks. For one thing, 
it was quite in character for him 
to tread curiously upon the 
strangers’ heels all the way to the 
temple — a ramshackle affair, but 
then it had been rim up in only 
three days — where the official re- 
ception was to be held. The prin- 
cipal difficulty was that, because 
of his equipment, he had a little 
trouble keeping himself from 
overshooting the strangers. And 
though Bbulas might frown men- 
acingly at him — and not only for 
his forwardness — that was in 
character on both sides, too. 

Nonetheless, Skkiru could not 
reconcile himself to his beggar- 
hood, no matter how much he 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



tried to comfort himself by think- 
ing at least he wasn’t a pariah like 
the unfortunate metal-workers 
who had to stand segregated from 
the rest by a chain of their own 
devising — a poetic thought, that 
was, but well in keeping with his 
beggarhood. Beggars were often 
poets, he believed, and poets al- 
most always beggars. Since metal- 
working was the chief industry of 
Snaddra, this had provided the 
planet automatically with a large 
lowest caste. Bbulas had taken 
the easy way out. 

Skkiru swallowed the last of 
the chocolate and regarded the 
“high priest” with a simple- 
minded mendicant’s grin. How- 
ever, there were volcanic passions 
within him that surged up from 
his toes when, as the wind and 
rain whipped through his scanty 
coverings, he remembered the 
snug underskirts Bbulas was 
wearing beneath his warm gown. 
They were metal, but they were 
solid. All the garments visible or 
potentially visible were of woven 
metal, because, although there 
was cloth on the planet, it was not 
politic for the Earthmen to dis- 
cover how heavily the Snaddrath 
dejjended upon imports. 

As the Earthmen reached the 
temple, Larhgan now appeared to 
join Bbulas at the head of the 
long flight of stairs that led to it. 
Although Skkiru had seen her in 
her priestly apparel before, it had 

15 



not made the emotional impres- 
sion upon him then that it did 
now, when, standing there, clad in 
beauty, dignity and warm clothes, 
she bade the newcomers welcome 
in several thousand words not too 
well chosen for her by Bbulas — 
who fancied himself a speech- 
writer as well as a speech-maker, 
for there was no end to the man’s 
conceit. 

The difference between her 
magnificent garments and his own 
miserable rags had their full im- 
pact upon Skirru at this moment. 
He saw the gulf that had been 
dug between them and, for the 
first time in his short life, he felt 
the tormenting pangs of caste dis- 
tinction. She looked so lovely and 
so remote. 

“. and so you are most wel- 
come to Snaddra, men of Earth,” 
she was saying in her melodious 
voice. “Our resources may be 
small but our hearts are large, 
and what little we have, we offer 
with humility and with love. We 
hope that you will enjoy as long 
and as happy a stay here as you 
did on Nemeth . .” 

Cyril looked at Raoul, who, 
however, seemed too absorbed in 
contemplating Larhgan’s appar- 
ently universal charms to pay 
much attention to the expression 
on his companion’s face. 

“. and that you will carry our 
affection back to all the peoples 
of the Galaxy.” 

16 



S HE had finished. And now 
Cyril cleared his throat. 
“Dear friends, we were ^lonored 
by your gracious invitation to 
visit this fair planet, and we are 
honored now by the cordial re- 
ception you have given to us.” 
The crowd yoomped politely. 
After a slight start, Cyril went on, 
apparently deciding that applause 
was all that had been intended. 

“We feel quite sure that we are 
going to derive both pleasure and 
profit from our stay here, and we 
promise to make our intensive 
analysis of your culture as pain- 
less as possible. We wish only to 
study your society, not to tamper 
with it in any way.” 

Ha, ha, Skkiru said to himself. 
Ha, ha, ha! 

“But why is it,” Raoul whis- 
pered in Terran as he glanced 
around out of the comers of his 
eyes, “that only the beggar wears 
mudshoes?” 

“Shhh,” Cyril hissed back. 
“We’ll find out later, when we’ve 
established rapport. Don’t be so 
impatient!” 

Bbulas gave a sickly smile. 
Skkiru could almost find it in his 
hearts to feel sorry for the man. 

“We have prepared our best 
hut for you, noble sirs,” Bbulas 
said with great self-control, “and, 
by happy chance, this very eve- 
ning a small but unusually inter- 
esting ceremony will be held out- 
side the temple. We hope you will 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be able to attend. It is to be a 
rain dance.” 

“Rain dance!” Raoul pulled his 
macintosh together more tightly 
at the throat. “But why do you 
want rain? My faith, not only 
does it rain now, but the planet 
seems to be a veritable sea of 
mud. Not, of course,” he added 
hurriedly as Cyril’s reproachful 
eye caught his, “that it is not at- 
tractive mud. Finest mud I have 
ever seen. Such texture, such 
color, such aroma!” 

Cyril nodded three times and 
gave an appreciative sniff. 

“But,” Raoul went on, “one can 
have too much of even such a 
good thing as mud . .” 

The smile did not leave Bbulas’ 
smooth face. “Yes, of course, hon- 
orable Terrestrials. That is why 
we are holding this ceremony. It 
is not a dance to bring on rain. It 
is a dance to stop rain.” 

He was pretty quick on the 
uptake, Skkiru had to concede. 
However, that was not enough. 
The man had no genuine organi- 
zational ability. In the time he’d 
had in which to plan and carry 
out a scheme for the improve- 
ment of Snaddra, surely he could 
have done better than this high- 
school theocracy. For one thing, 
he could have apportioned the 
various roles so that each person 
would be making a definite con- 
tribution to the society, instead of 
creating some positions plums, 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



like the priesthood, and others 
prunes, like the beggarship. 

What kind of life was that for 
an active, ambitious yoimg man, 
standing around begging? And, 
moreover, from whom was Skkiru 
going to beg? Only the Earthmen, 
for the Snaddrath, no matter how 
much they threw themselves into 
the spirit of their roles, could not 
be so carried away that they 
would give handouts to a young 
man whom they had been accus- 
tomed to see basking in the 
bosom of luxury. 

TTNFORTUNATELY, the fees 
^ that he’d received in the past 
had not enabled him both to live 
well and to save, and now that his 
fortunes had been so drastically 
reduced, he seemed in a fair way 
of starving to death. It gave him a 
gentle, moody pleasure to envis- 
age his own funeral, although, at 
the same time, he realized that 
Bbulas would probably have to 
arrange some sort of pension for 
him; he could not expect Skkiru’s 
patriotism to extend to abnormal 
limits. A man might be willing to 
die for his planet in many ways — 
but wantonly starving to death as 
the result of a primitive affecta- 
tion was hardly one of them. 

All the same, Skkiru reflected 
as he watched the visitors being 
led off to the native hut prepared 
for them, how ignominious it 
would be for one of the brightest 

17 



young architects on the planet to 
have to subsist miserably on the 
dole just because the world had 
gone aboveground. The capital 
had risen to the surface and the 
other cities would soon follow 
suit. Meanwhile, a careful system 
of tabus had been designed to 
keep the Earthmen from discov- 
ering the existence of those other 
cities. 

He could, of course, emigrate 
to another j>art of the planet, to 
one of them, and stave off his 
doom for a while — but that 
would not be playing the game. 
Besides, in such a case, he 
wouldn’t be able to see Larhgan. 

As if all this weren’t bad 
enough, he had been done an in- 
jury which struck directly at his 
professional pride. He hadn’t 
even been allowed to help in 
planning the huts. Bbulas and 
some workmen had done all that 
themselves with the aid of some 
antique blueprints that had been 
put out centuries before by a Ter- 
restrial magazine and had been 
acquired from a rare tape-and- 
book dealer on Gambrell, for, 
Skkiru thought, far too high a 
price. He could have designed 
them himself just as badly and 
much more cheaply. 

It wasn’t that Skkiru didn’t un- 
derstand well enough that 
Snaddra had been forced into 
making such a drastic change in 
its way of life. What resources it 



once possessed had been depleted 
and — aside from minerals — they 
had never been very extensive to 
begin with. All life-forms on the 
planet were on the point of ex- 
tinction, save fish and rice — the 
only vegetable that would grow 
on Snaddra, and originally a Ter- 
ran import at that. So food and 
fiber had to be brought from the 
other planets, at fabulous expense, 
for Snaddra was not on any of the 
direct trade routes and was too 
unattractive to lure the tourist 
business. 

Something definitely had to be 
done, if it were not to decay alto- 
gether. And that was where the 
Planetary Dilettante came in. 

^^HE traditional office of Plane- 
-*• tary Dilettante was a civil- 
service job, awarded by competi- 
tive examination whenever it fell 
vacant to the person who scored 
highest in intelligence, character 
and general gloonatz. However, 
the tests were inadequate when 
it came to measuring sense of 
proportion, adaptiveness and 
charm — and there, Skkiru felt, 
was where the essential flaw lay. 
After all, no really effective test 
would have let a person like 
Bbulas come out on top. 

The winner was sent to Gam- 
brell, the nearest planet with a 
Terran League University, to be 
given a thorough Terran-type 
education. No individual on 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Snaddra could afford such school- 
ing, no matter how great his per- 
sonal fortime, because the trans- 
portation costs were so immense 
that only a government could af- 
ford them. That was the reason 
why only one person in each gen- 
eration could be chosen to go 
abroad at the planet’s expense 
and acquire enough finish to 
cover the rest of the population. 

The Dilettante’s official func- 
tion had always been, in theory, 
to serve the planet when an emer- 
gency came — and this, old Luc- 
car, the former President, had 
decided, when he and the Parlia- 
ment had awakened to the fact 
that Snaddra was falling into 
ruin, was an emergency. So he 
had, after considerable soul- 
searching, called uix>n Bbulas to 
plan a method of saving Snaddra 
— and Bbulas, happy to be in the 
limelight at last, had come up 
with this program. 

It was not one Skkiru himself 
would have chosen. It was not 
one, he felt, that any reasonable 
person would have chosen. Nev- 
ertheless, the Bbulas Plan had 
been adopted by a majority vote 
of the Snaddrath, largely because 
no one had come up with a fea- 
sible alternative and, as a patrio- 
tic citizen, Skkiru would abide by 
it. He would accept the status of 
beggar; it was his duty to do so. 
Moreover, as in the case of the 
planet, there was no choice. 



But all was not necessarily 
lost, he told himself. Had he not, 
in his anthropological viewings — 
though Bbulas might have been 
the only one privileged to go on 
ethnological field trips to other 
planets, he was not the only one 
who could use a library — seen ac- 
counts of societies where beggar- 
hood could be a rewarding and 
even responsible station in life? 
There was no reason why, within 
the framework of the primitive 
society Bbulas had created to al- 
lure Terran anthropologists, 
Skkiru should not make some- 
thing of himself and show that a 
beggar was worthy of the high 
priestess’s hand — which would be 
entirely in the Terran primitive 
tradition of romance. 

“Skkiru!” Bbulas was scream- 
ing, as he spim, now that the 
Terrans were out of ear- and eye- 
shot. “Skkiru, you idiot, listen to 
me! What are those ridiculous 
things you are wearing on your 
silly feet?” 

Skkiru protruded all of his eyes 
in innocent surprise. “Just some 
old pontoons I took from a 
wrecked air-car once. I have a 
habit of collecting jimk and I 
thought — ” 

Bbulas twirled madly in the 
air. “You are not supposed to 
think. Leave all the thinking to 
me!” 

“Yes, Bbulas,” Skkiru said 
meekly. 



THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



19 



TTE WOULD have put up an 
argument, but he had big- 
ger plans in mind and he didn’t 
want them impeded in any way. 

“But they seem like an excel- 
lent idea,” Luccar suggested. 
“Primitive and yet convenient.” 
Bbulas slowed down and 
gulped. After all, in spite of the 
fact that he was now only chief 
yam -stealer — being prevented 
from practicing his profession 
simply because there were no 
yams on the planet and no one 
was quite certain what they were 
— Luccar had once been elected 
President by a large popular ma- 
jority. And a large popular ma- 
jority is decidedly a force to be 
reckoned with anywhere in the 
Galaxy. 

“Any .deviations arouse com- 
ment,” Bbulas explained tightly. 
“But if we all—” 

“There would not be enough 
pontoons to go around, even if we 
stripped all the air-cars.” 

“I see,” Luccar said thought- 
fully. “We couldn’t make—?” 

“No time!” Bbulas snapped. 
“All right, Skkiru — get those 
things off your feet!” 

“Will do,” Skkiru agreed. It 
would be decidedly unwise to put 
up an argument now. So he’d get 
his feet muddy; it was all part of 
the higher good. 

Later, as soon as the rain-dance 
rehearsals were imder way, he 
slipped away. No part had been 



assigned to him anyhow, except 
that of onlooker, and he thought 
he could manage that without 
practice. He went down to the li- 
brary, where, since all the atten- 
dants were aboveground, he could 
browse in the stacks to his hearts’ 
content, without having to fill out 
numerous forms and be shoved 
about like a plagiarist or some- 
thing. 

If the Earthmen were inter- 
ested in really primitive institu- 
tions, he thought, they should 
have a look at the city library. 
The filing system was really me- 
dieval. However, the library 
would, of course, be tabu for 
them, along with the rest of the 
city, which was not supposed to 
exist. 

As far as the Terrans were to 
know, the group of lumpy stone 
huts (they should, properly 
speaking, have been wood, but 
wood was too rare and expen- 
sive) was the capital of Snaddra. 
It would be the capital of Snad- 
dra for the Snaddrath, too, except 
during the hours of rest, when 
they would be p>ermitted to re- 
tire unobtrusively to their cozy 
well-drained quarters beneath the 
mud. Life was going to be hard 
from now on — unless the Bbulas 
Plan moved faster than Bbulas 
himself had anticipated. And that 
would never happen without im- 
plementation from without. From 
without Bbulas, that was. 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Skkiru got to work on the tex- 
tapes and soon decided upon his 
area of operations. Bbulas had 
concentrated so much effort on 
the ethos of the planet that he 
had devoted insufficient detail to 
the mythos. That, therefore, was 
the field in which Skkiru felt he 
must concentrate. And concen- 
trate he did. 

HE rain dance, which had 
been elaborately staged by 
the planet’s finest choreographers, 
came to a smashing climax, after 
which there was a handsome dis- 
play of fireworks. 

“But it is still raining,” Raoul 
protested. 

“Did you expect the rain to 
stop?” Bbulas asked, his eyes 
bulging with involuntary surprise. 
“I mean—” he said, hastily re- 
tracting them —“well, it doesn’t al- 
ways stop right away. The gods 
may not have been feeling suffi- 
ciently propitious.” 

“Thought you had only one 
god, old boy,” Cyril observed, 
after giving his associate a search- 
ing glance. “Chap by the name 
of Whipsnade or some such.” 

“Ipsnadd. He is our chief deity. 
But we have a whole pantheon. 
Major gods and minor gods. He- 
roes and demigods and nature 
spirits — ” 

“And do not forget the proph- 
ets,” Larhgan put in helpfully. As 
former Chief Beauty of the planet 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



(an elective civil-service office), 
she was not accustomed to being 
left out of things. “We have many 
prophets. And saints. I myself am 
studying to be a — ” 

Bbulas glared at her. Though 
her antennae quivered sulkily, 
she stopped and said no more — 
for the moment, anyway. 

“Sounds like quite a complex 
civilization,” Cyril commented. 

“No, no!” Bbulas protested in 
alarm. “We are a simple primi- 
tive people without technological 
pretensions.” 

“You don’t need any,” Cyril as- 
sured him. “Not when you have 
fireworks that function in the 
rain.” 

Inside himself, Skkiru guf- 
fawed. 

“We are a simple people,” 
Bbulas rejjeated helplessly. “A 
very simple and very primitive 
people.” 

“Somehow,” Raoul said, “I feel 
you may have a quality that civi- 
lization may have lost.” The light 
in his eyes was recognizable to 
any even remotely humanoid spe- 
cies as a mystic glow. 

But Cyril seemed well in com- 
mand of the situation. “Come 
now, Raoul,” he laughed, clapping 
his young colleague on the shoul- 
der, “don’t fall into the Rousseau 
trap — noble savage and all that 
sort of rot!” 

“But that beggar!” Raoul in- 
sisted. “Trite, certainly, but in- 

21 










fM'i^:k 



credible nonetheless! Before, one 
only read of such things — ” 

A glazed look came into two 
of Bbulas’ eyes, while the third 
closed despairingly. “What beg- 
gar? What beggar? Tell me — I 
must know ... as if I didn’t 
really,” he muttered in Snaddrath. 

“The only beggar we’ve seen on 
this planet so far. That one.” 

W ITH a wave of his hand, 
Cyril indicated the modest 
form of Skkiru, attempting to 
conceal himself behind Luccar’s 
portly person. 

“I realize it was only illusion, 
but, as my associate says, a re- 

22 



markably good one. And,” Cjo-il 
added, “an even more remarkable 
example of cultural diffusion.” 

“What do you mean? Please, 
gracious and lovable Terrans, 
deign to tell me what you mean. 
What did that insufferable beg- 
gar do?” 

In spite of himself, Skkiru’s 
knees flickered. Fool, he told him- 
self, you knew it was bound to 
come out sooner or later. Take 
courage in your own convictions; 
be convinced by your own cour- 
age. All he really can do is yell. 

“He did the Indian rope trick 
for us,” Raoul explained. “And 
very well, too. Very well indeed.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“The — Indian rope trick!” 
Bbulas spluttered. “>^y, the—” 
And then he recollected his reli- 
gious vocation, as well as his sup- 
(wsed ignorance. “Would you be 
so kind as to tell me what the 
Indian rop>e trick is, good sirs?” 

“Well, he did it with a chain, 
actually.” 

“We have no ropes on this 
planet,” Larhgan contributed. “We 
are backward.” 

“And a small boy went up and 
disappeared,” Raoul finished. 

Suddenly forgetting the stiff- 
upper-lip training for which the 
planet had gone to such great ex- 
pense, Bbulas spun around and 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



around in a fit of bad temper, to 
Skkiru’s great glee. Fortimately, 
the Dilettante retained enough 
self-control to keep his feet on the 
groimd — perhaps remembering 
that to fail to do so would com- 
pound Skkiru’s crime. 

“Dervishism!” Raoul exclaimed, 
his eyes incandescent with inter- 
est. He pulled out his notebook. 
After biting his lip thoughtfully, 
Cjrril did the same. 

“Just like Skkiru!” Bbulas 
gasped as he spun slowly to a 
stop. “He is a disruptive cultural 
mechanism. Leading children 
astray!” 

“But not at all,” Raoul pointed 

23 



out politely. “The boy came back 
unharmed and in the best of 
spirits.” 

“So far as we could see,” C3rril 
amended. “Of course there may 
have been psychic damage.” 
“Which boy was it?” Bbulas 
demanded. 

/^YRIL pointed to the urchin 
^ in question — a rather well- 
known juvenile delinquent, 
though the Terrestrials, of course, 
couldn’t know that. 

“He is a member of my own 
clan,” Bbulas said. “He will be 
thrashed soimdly.” 

“But why punish him?” Raoul 
asked. “What harm has he done?” 
“Shhh,” Cyril warned him. 
“You may be touching on a tabu. 
What’s the matter with you, any- 
way? One would think you had 
forgotten every lesson you ever 
learned.” 

“Oh, I am truly sorry!” Raoul’s 
face became a pleasing shade of 
pink, which made him look much 
more human. Maybe it was the 
wrong color, but at least it was a 
color. “Please to accept my apolo- 
gies, reverend sir.” 

“It’s quite all right.” Bbulas re- 
verted to graciousness. “The boy 
should not have associated with 
a beggar— especially that one. If 
he did not hold his post by time- 
hallowed tradition, we would — 
dispose of him. He has always 
been a trouble-maker.” 



“But I do not understand,” 
Raoul persisted. Skkiru could not 
xmderstand why Cjrril did not 
stop him again. “The beggar did 
the trick very effectively. I know 
it was all illusion, but I should 
like to know just how he created 
such an illusion, and, moreover, 
how the Indian rope trick got all 
the way to—” 

“It was all done by magic,” 
Bbulas said firmly. “Magic out- 
side the temple is not encouraged, 
because it is black magic, and so 
it is wrong. The magic of the 
priests is white magic, and so it is 
right. Put that down in your little 
book.” 

Raoul obediently wrote it down. 
“Still, I should like to know — ” 

“Let us speak of pleasanter 
things,” Bbulas interrupted again. 
“Tomorrow night, we are holding 
a potlatch and we should be hon- 
ored to have the pleasure of your 
company.” 

“Delighted,” Raoul bowed. 

“I was wrong,” Cyril said. “This 
is not a remarkable example of 
cultural diffusion. It is a remark- 
able example of a diffuse culture.” 

?ft>UT I cannot understand,” 
Raoul said to Cyril later, 
in the imagined privacy of their 
hut. “Why are you suspicious of 
this charming, friendly people, so 
like the natives that the textbooks 
lead one to expect?” 

Naturally, Skkiru— having made 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his way in through a secret pas- 
sage known only to the entire 
population of the city and explic- 
itly designed for espionage, and 
was spying outside the door — 
thought, we are textbook natives. 
Not only because we were pat- 
terned on literary prototypes, but 
because Bbulas never really left 
school — in spirit, anyway. He is 
the perpetual undergraduate and 
his whole scheme is nothing more 
than a grandiose Class Night. 

“Precisely what I’ve been think- 
ing,” Cyril said. “So like the text- 
books— all the textbooks put to- 
gether.” 

“What do you mean? Surely it 
is possible for analogous cultural 
features to develop independently 
in different cultures?” 

“Oh, it’s possible, all right. 
Probability— particularly when it 
comes to such a great number of 
features packed into one small 
culture— is another matter en- 
tirely.” 

“I cannot understand you,” , 
Raoul objected. ‘What do you 
want of these poor natives? To 
me, it seems everything has been 
of the most idyllic. Rapport was 
established almost immediately.” 

“A little too immediately, per- 
haps, don’t you think? You 
haven’t had much experience, 
Raoul, so you might not be aware 
it usually isn’t as easy as this.” 

Cyril flung himself down on 
one of the cots that had been 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



especially hardened for Terres- 
trial use and blew smoke rings 
at the ceiling. Skkiru was dying 
for a cigarette himself, but that 
was another cultiual feature the 
Snaddrath had to dispense with 
now — not that smoking was in- 
sufficiently primitive, but that to- 
bacco was not indigenous to the 
planet. 

“That is because they are not 
a hostile people,” Raoul insisted. 
“Apparently they have no ene- 
mies. Nonetheless, they are of the 
utmost interest. I hardly expiected 
to land a society like this on my 
very first field trip,” he added 
joyfully. “Never have I heard of 
so dynamic a culture! Never!” 

“Nor I,” Cyril agreed, “and this 
is far from being my very first 
field trip. It has a terribly large 
number of strange elements in it 
— strange, that is, when consid- 
ered in relationship to the society 
as a whole. Environmental pres- 
sures seem to have had no effect 
upon their culture. For instance, 
don’t you think it rather remark- 
able that a people with such an 
enormously complex social struc- 
ture as theirs should wear cloth- 
ing so ill adapted to protect them 
from the weather?” 

^f¥W7ELL,” Raoul pointed out 
^ enthusiastically — another 
undergraduate type, Skkiru ob- 
served, happiest with matters that 
either resembled those in books 

25 



or came directly from them, so 
that they could be explicitly pi- 
geonholed — “the Indians of Ti- 
erra del Fuego wore nothing but 
waist-length sealskin capes even 
in the bitterest cold. Of course, 
this civilization is somewhat more 
advanced than theirs in certain 
ways, but one finds such anoma- 
lies in all primitive civilizations, 
does one not?” 

“That’s true to a certain extent. 
But one would think they’d at 
least have developed boots to 
cope with the mud. And why was 
the beggar the only one to wear 
mudshoes? Why, moreover—” 
Cyril narrowed his eyes and 
pointed his cigarette at Raoul — 
“did he wear them only the first 
time and subsequently appear 
barefooted?” 

“That was odd,” Raoul admit- 
ted, “but-” 

“And the high priest spoke of 
thrashing that boy. You should 
know, old chap, that cruelty to 
children is in inverse ratio to the 
degree of civilization.” 

Raoul stared at his colleague. 
“My faith, are you suggesting that 
we go see how hard they hit him, 
then?” 

Cyril laughed. “All I suggest is 
that we keep a very open mind 
about this society until we can 
discover what fundamental atti- 
tudes are controlling such curious 
individual as well as group be- 
havior.” 

26 



“But assuredly. That is what 
we are here for, is it not? So why 
are you disturbing yovirself so 
much?” 

But it was Raoul, Skkiru 
thought, who appeared much 
more disturbed than Csrril. It was 
understandable — the younger 
man was interested only in 
straightforward ethnologizing and 
undoubtedly found the develop- 
ing complications upsetting. 

“Look,” Cyril continued. “They 
call this place a hut. It’s almost a 
palace.” 

My God, Skkiru thought, what 
kind of primitive conditions are 
they used to? 

“That is largely a question of 
semantics,” Raoul protested. “But 
regard — the roof leaks. Is that not 
backward enough for you, eh?” 
And Raoul moved to another 
part of the room to avoid receiv- 
ing indisputable proof of the leak- 
age on his person. “What is more, 
the sanitary arrangements are tm- 
deniably primitive.” 

“The roofs of many palaces 
leak, and there is no plumbing to 
speak of, and still they are not 
called huts. And tell me this — 
why should the metal-workers be 
the pariahs? Why metal-workers?” 

Raoul’s eyes opened wide. 
“You know there is often an out- 
cast class with no apparent ra- 
tionale behind its establishment 
All the tapes—” 

“True enough, but you will re- 

6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



member that the reason the 
smiths of Masai were pariahs was 
that they manufactured weapons 
which might tempt people to 
commit bloodshed. I keep remem- 
bering them, somehow. I keep re- 
membering so many things 
here . .” 

“But we have seen no weapons 
on this planet,” Raoul argued. “In 
fact, the people seem completely 
peaceful.” 

“Right you are.” Cyril blew an- 
other smoke ring. “Since this is 
a planet dependent chiefly upon 
minerals, why make the members 
of its most imp>ortant industry the 
out-group?” 

“You think it is that they may 
be secretly hostile?” 

Cyril smiled. “I think they may 
be secretly something, but hardly 
hostile.” 

Aha, Skkiru thought. Bbulas, 
my splendidly scaled friend, I will 
have something interesting to tell 
you. 

idiot!” Bbulas snarled 
later that night, as most of 
the Snaddrath met informally in 
the council chamber belowground, 
the new caste distinctions being, 
if not forgotten, at least in abey- 
ance— for everyone except 
Bbulas. “You imbecile!” He 
whirled, unable to repress his 
Snadd emotions after a long be- 
haviorally Terran day. “I have 
half a mind to get rid of you by 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



calling down divine judgment.” 

“How would you do that?” 
Skkiru demanded, emboldened 
by the little cry of dismay, ac- 
companied by a semi-somersault, 
which Larhgan gave. In spite of 
everything, she still loved him; 
she would never belong to Bbulas, 
though he might plan until he was 
ochre in the face. 

“Same way you did the rope 
trick. Only you wouldn’t come 
back, my boy. Nice little cultural 
trait for the ethnologists to put in 
their peace pipes and smoke. 
Never saw such people for ask- 
ing awkward questions.” Bbulas 
sighed and straightened his an- 
tennae with his fingers, since their 
ornaments made them too heavy 
to allow reflective verticalization. 
“Remind me of final exams back 
on Gambrell.” 

“Anthropologists always ask 
awkward questions — everybody 
knows that,” Larhgan put in. “It’s 
their function. And I don’t think 
you should speak that way to 
Skkiru, Bbulas. Like all of us, he’s 
only trying to do his best. No 
man — or woman — can do more.” 

She smiled at Skkiru and his 
hearts whirled madly inside him. 
Only a dolt, he thought, would 
give way to despair; there was 
no need for this intolerable situa- 
tion to endure for a lifetime. If 
only he could solve the problem 
more quickly than Bbulas ex- 
pected or — Skkiru began to un- 

27 



derstand — wanted, Larhgan could 
be his again. 

“With everybody trying to run 
this planet,” Bbulas snarled, tak- 
ing off his headdress, “no wonder 
things are going wrong.” 

Luccar intervened. Although it 
was obvious that he had been en- 
joying to a certain extent the 
happy anonymity of functionless 
yam-stealer, old elective responsi- 
bilities could not but hang heavy 
over a public servant of such un- 
impeachable integrity. 

“After all,” the old man said, 
“secretly we’re still a democracy, 
and secretly I am still President, 
and secretly I’m beginning to 
wonder if perhaps we weren’t a 
little rash in—” 

“Look here, all of you,” Bbulas 
interrupted querulously. “I’m not 
doing this for my own amuse- 
ment.” 

T> UT thafs just what you are 
doing, Skkiru thought, even 
though you wouldn’t admit it to 
yourself, nor would you think of 
it as amusement. 

“You know what happened to 
Nemeth,” Bbulas continued, using 
an argument that had convinced 
them before, but that was begin- 
ning to wear a little thin now. 
“Poorest, most backward planet 
in the whole Galaxy. A couple of 
ethnologists from Earth stumbled 
on it a little over a century ago 
and what happened? More kept 



on coming; the trade ships fol- 
lowed. Now it’s the richest, most 
advanced planet in that whole 
sector. There’s no reason why the 
same thing can’t happen to us in 
this sector, if we play our cards 
carefully.” 

“But maybe these two won’t 
tell other anthropologists about 
us,” Luccar said. “Something the 
older one remarked certainly 
seemed to imply as much. Maybe 
they don’t want the same thing 
to happen again — in which case, 
all this is a waste of time. Fur- 
thermore,” he concluded rather 
petulantly, “at my age, I don’t like 
running about in the open; it’s not 
healthful.” 

“If they don’t tell other anthro- 
pologists about us,” Bbulas said, 
his face paling to lime-green with 
anxiety, “we can spread the news 
unobtrusively ourselves. Just let 
one study be published, even un- 
■ der false coordinates, and we can 
always hire a good public rela- 
tions man to let our whereabouts 
leak out. Please, everybody, stick 
to your appointed tasks and let 
me do the worrying. You haven’t 
even given this culture a chance! 
It’s hardly more than a day old 
and all I hear are complaints, 
complaints, complaints.” 

“You’d better worry,” Skkiru 
said smugly, “because already 
those Terrans think there’s some- 
thing fishy about this culture. Ha, 
ha! Did you get that— fishy?” 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCC FICTION 



Only Larhgan laughed. She 
loved him. 

“How do you know they’re sus- 
picious?” Bbulas demanded. “Are 
you in their confidence? Skkiru, 
if you’ve been talking—” 

“All I did was spy outside their 
door,” Skkiru said hastily. “I knew 
you couldn’t eavesdrop; it 
wouldn’t look dignified if you 
were caught. But beggars do that 
kind of thing all the time. And I 
wanted to show you I could be of 
real use.” 

He beamed at Larhgan, who 
beamed back. 

“I could have kept my findings 
to myself,” he went on, “but I 
came to tell you. In fact—” he 
dug in his robe— “I even jotted 
down a few notes.” 

“It wasn’t at all necessary, 
Skkiru,” Bbulas said in a tired 
voice. “We took the elementary 
precaution of wiring their hut for 
sound and a recorder is con- 
stantly taking down their every 
word.” 

“Hut!” Skkiru kept his anten- 
nae under control with an effort, 
but his retort was feeble. “They 
think it’s a palace. You did them 
too well, Bbulas.” 

“I may have overdone the ex- 
terior architecture a bit,” the high 
priest admitted. “Not that it 
seems relevant to the discussion. 
Although I’ve been trying to ar- 
range our primitivism according 
to Terrestrial ideas of cultural 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



backwardness, I’m afraid many 
of the physical arrangements are 
primitive according to our con- 
ceptions rather than theirs.” 

Vj^HY must we be primitive 
™ according to Terran 
ideas?” Luccar wanted to know. 
“Why must we be slaves even to 
fashions in backwardness?” 

“Hear, hear!” cried an anony- 
mous voice. 

“And thank you, Skkiru,” the 
former President continued, “for 
telling me they were suspicious. 
I doubt that Bbulas would have 
taken the trouble to inform me of 
so trivial a matter.” 

“As high priest,” Bbulas said 
stiffly, “I believe the matter, triv- 
ial or not, now falls within my 
province.” 

“Shame!” cried an anonymous 
voice — or it might have been the 
same one. 

Bbulas turned forest-green and 
his antennae twitched. “After all, 
you yourself, Luccar, agreed to 
accept the role of elder states- 
man — ” 

“Yam-stealer,” Luccar corrected 
him bitterly, “which is not the 
same thing.” 

“On Earth, it is. And,” Bbulas 
went on quickly, “as for our as- 
suming primitive Earth attitudes, 
where else are we going to get 
our attitudes from? We can’t bor- 
row any primitive attitudes from 
Nemeth, because they’re too well 

29 



known. And since there are no 
other planets we know of with in- 
telligent life-forms that have so- 
cial struchires markedly different 
from the major Terran ones — ex- 
cept for some completely non- 
humanoid cultures, which, for 
physiological reasons, we are in- 
capable of imitating — we have to 
rely upon records of primitive 
Terran sources for information. 
Besides, a certain familiarity with 
the traits manifested will make 
the culture more understandable 
to the Terrans, and, hence, more 
attractive to them psychologi- 
cally.” He stopped and straight- 
ened out his antennae. 

“In other words,” Skkiru com- 
mented, emboldened by a certain 
aura of sympathy he felt emanat- 
ing from Larhgan, at least, and 
probably from Luccar, too, “he 
doesn’t have the imagination to 
think up any cultural traits for 
himself, so he has to steal them — 
and that’s the easiest place to 
steal them from.” 

“This is none of your business, 
Skkiru,” Bbulas snapped. “You 
just beg.” 

“It’s the business of all of us, 
Bbulas,” Luccar corrected softly. 
“Please to remember that, no 
matter what our alloted roles, we 
are all concerned equally in this.” 

“Of course, of course, but please 
let me handle the situation in my 
own way, since I made the plans. 
And, Skkiru,” the Dilettante 

30 



added with strained grace, “you 
may have a warm cloak to wear 
as soon as we can get patches 
welded on.” 

Then Bbulas took a deep 
breath and reverted to his old 
cheer-leader manner. “Now we 
must all get organized for the 
p>otlatch. We can give the Ter- 
rans those things the Ladies’ Aid 
has been working on all year for 
the charity bazaar and, in ex- 
change, perhaps they will give us 
more chocolate bars — ” he glanced 
reproachfully at Skkiru — “and 
other food.” 

“And perhaps some yams,” 
Luccar suggested, “so that — God 
save us — I can steal them.” 

“I’ll definitely work on that,” 
Bbulas promised. 

CKKIRU was glad that, as beg- 
^ gar, he held no prominent po- 
sition at the feast — in reality, no 
position at all — for he hated fish. 
And fish, naturally, would be the 
chief refreshment offered, since 
the Snaddrath did not want the 
Terrans to know that they had 
already achieved that degrading 
dependency upon the tin can that 
marks one of the primary differ- 
ences between savagery and civi- 
lization. 

There were fish pate on rice 
crackers, fish soup with rice, 
boiled fish, baked fish, fried fish 
and a pilau of rice with fish. 
There were fish chitlins, fish chips, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fish cakes, fish candy and gnslat — 
a potent distillation of fermented 
fish livers — to wash it all down. 
And even in the library, where 
Skkiru sought refuge from the 
festivities, fishy fumes kept filter- 
ing down through the ventilating 
system to assail his nostrils. 

Bbulas had been right in a way, 
Skkiru had to admit to himself 
upon reflection. In trying to im- 
prove his lot, Skkiru had taken 
advantage of the Snaddrath’s spe- 
cial kinetic talents, which had 
been banned for the diuation — 
and so he had, in effect, commit- 
ted a crime. 

This time, however, he would 
seek to uplift himself in terms ac- 
ceptable to the Terrans on a 
wholly indigenous level, and in 
terms which would also hasten 
the desired corruptive process — 
in a nice way, of course — so that 
the Snaddrath civilization could 
be profitably undermined as fast 
as possible and Larhgan be his 
once again. It was a hard problem 
to solve, but he felt sure he could 
do it. Anj^hirig Bbulas could do, 
he could do better. 

Then he had it! And the idea 
was so wonderful that he was a 
little sorry at the limited range it 
would necessarily cover. His part 
really should be played out be- 
fore a large, yoomping audience, 
but he was realistic enough to see 
that it would be most expedient 
for him to give a private perform- 



ance for the Earthmen alone. 

On the other hand, he now 
knew it should be offered outside 
the hut, because the recorder 
would pick up his cries and 
Bbulas would be in a spin — as he 
would be about any evidence of 
independent thinking on the 
planet. Bbulas was less interested 
in the planet’s prospering, it was 
now clear to Skkiru, than in its 
continuing in a state where he 
would remain top fish. 

P»ORTUNATELY, the guslat 
■*- had done its work, and by the 
time the Earthmen arrived at the 
door to their hut, they were alone. 
The rest of the company either 
had fallen into a stupor or could 
not trust themselves to navigate 
the mud. 

The Earthmen— with an ingen- 
iousness which would have au- 
gured well for the futrire develop>- 
ment of their race, had it not al- 
ready been the (allegedly) most 
advanced species in the Galaxy — 
had adapted some spare parts 
from their ship into replicas of 
Skirru’s mudshoes. They did, in 
truth, seem none too steady on 
their feet, but he was unable to 
determine to what degree this 
was a question of intoxication 
and what degree a question of 
navigation. 

“Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd.” 
He thrust forward his begging 
bowl. 



THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



31 



“Regard, it is the beggar! Why 
were you not at the festivities, 
worthy mendicant?” Raoul hic- 
cuped. “Lovely party. Beautiful 
women. Delicious fish.” 

Skkiru started to stand on his 
head, then remembered this was 
no longer a socially acceptable 
expression of grief and cast his 
eyes down. “I was not invited,” 
he said sadly. 

“Like the little match girl,” 
Raoul sympathized. “My heart 
bleeds for you, good match gi — 
good beggar. Does your heart not 
bleed for him, Cyril?” 

“Bad show,” the older ethnolo- 
gist agreed, with a faint smile. 
“But that’s what you’ve got to ex- 
pect, if you’re going to be a primi- 
tive.” 

He was very dnmk, Skkiru de- 
cided; he must be, to phrase his 
sentiments so p>oorly. Unless he — 
but no, Skkiru refused to believe 
that. He didn’t mind Cyril’s being 
vaguely suspicious, but that was 
as far as he wanted him to go. 
Skkiru’s toes apprehensively 
started to quiver. 

“How can you say a thing like 
that to a primitive?” Raoul de- 
manded. “If he were not a primi- 
tive, it would be all right to call 
him a primitive, but one does not 
accuse primitives of being primi- 
tives. It’s — it’s downright primi- 
tive; that’s what it is!” 

“You need some coffee, my 
boy.” Cyril grinned. “Black cof- 

32 



fee. That guslat of theirs is highly 
potent stuff.” 

They were about to go inside. 
Skkiru had to act quickly. He 
slumped over. Although he had 
meant to land on the doorstep, he 
lacked the agility to balance him- 
self with the precision required 
and so he fell smack into the 
mud. The feel of the slime on his 
bare feet had been bad enough; 
oozing over his skin through the 
interstices of his clothing, it was 
pure hell. What sacrifices he was 
making for his planet! And for 
Larhgan. The thought of her 
would have to sustain him 
through this viscous ordeal, for 
there was nothing else solid 
within his grasp. 

“Ubbl,” he said, lifting his head 
from the ooze, so that they could 
see the froth coming out of his 
mouth. “Glubbl.” 

"OAOUL clutched Cyril. “What 
is he doing?” 

“Having an epileptic fit, I rather 
fancy. Go on, old man,” Cyril said 
to Skkiru. “You’re doing splen- 
didly. Splendidly!” 

“I see the sky!” Skkiru howled, 
anxious to get his prophecies over 
with before he sank any deeper 
in the mud. “It is great magic. I 
see many ship>s in the sky. They 
are all coming to Snaddra . .” 

“Bearing anthropologists and 
chocolate bars, I suppose,” mur- 
mured Cyril. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Shhh,” Raoul said indignantly. 
“You must not interrupt. He is 
having personal contact with the 
supernatural, a very important 
element of the primitive ethos.” 
“Thank you,” Cyril said. “I’ll 
try to remember that.” 

So will I, thought Skirru. “They 
carry learned men and food for 
the spiritually and physically 
hungry people of Snaddra,” he in- 
terrupted impatiently. “They 
carry warm clothing for the poor 
and miserable people of Snaddra. 
They carry yams for the larce- 
nous and frustrated people of 
Snaddra.” 

“Yams!” Raoul echoed. “Yams!” 
“Shhh, this is fascinating. Go 
on, beggar.” 

But the mud sogging over 
Skkiru’s body was too much. The 
fit could be continued at a later 
date — and in a drier location. 

“Where am I?” he asked, 
struggling to a sitting position. 

“You are on Snaddra, fifth 
planet of the sun Weebl,” Raoul 
began, “in — ” 

“Weeeeebl,” Skkiru corrected, 
getting to his feet with the older 
ethnologist’s assistance. “What 
happened?” He beat futilely at 
the mud caught in the meshes of 
his metal rags. “I feel faint.” 
“Come in and have some cof- 
fee with us,” Cyril invited. This 
also was p»art of Skirru’s plan, for 
he had no intention of going back 
across that mud, if he could f>os- 




THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



33 



sibly help it. He had nothing fur- 
ther to say that the recorders 
should not hear. Bbulas might ob- 
ject to his associating with the 
Earthmen, but he couldn’t do 
much if the association seemed 
entirely innocent. At the moment, 
Snaddra might be a theocracy, 
but the democratic hangover was 
still strong. 

“I would rather have some hot 
chocolate,” Skkiru said. “That is, 
if you have no objection to drink- 
ing with a beggar.” 

“My dear fellow—” Cyril put 
an arm around Skkiru’s muddy 
shoulders — “we ethnologists do 
not hold with caste distinctions. 
Come in and have chocolate — 
with a spot of rum, eh? That’ll 
make you right as a trivet in a 
matter of seconds.” 

TT WASN’T until much later, 
after several cups of the finest 
chocolate he had ever tasted, that 
Skkiru announced himself to feel 
quite recovered. 

“Please do not bother to ac- 
company me to the door,” he said. 
“I can find my own way. You do 
me too much honor. I would feel 
shamefaced.” 

“But -” Cyril began. 

“No,” Skkiru said. “It is — it is 
bad form here. I insist. I must go 
my way alone.” 

“All right,” Cyril agreed. 

Raoul looked at him in some 
surprise. 

34 



“All right,” Cyril repeated in a 
louder tone. “Go by yourself, if 
an escort would bother you. But 
please give the door a good bang, 
so the lock will catch.” 

Skkiru slammed the door lust- 
ily to simulate the effect of de- 
parture and then he descended 
via the secret p>assage inside the 
hut itself, scrabbling a little be- 
cause the hot chocolate seemed 
strangely to have affected his 
sense of balance. 

The rest of the Snaddrath 
were in the council chamber 
gloating over the loot from the 
potlatch. It was, as a matter of 
fact, a good take. 

“Where were you, Skkiru?” 
Bbulas asked, examining a jar of 
preserved kumquats suspiciously. 
“Up to no good. I’ll be bound.” 
“Oh, my p>oor Skkiru!” Larhgan 
exclaimed, before Skkiru could 
say anything. “How muddy and 
wretched-looking you are! I don’t 
like this whole thing,” she told 
Bbulas. “It’s cruel. Being high 
priestess isn’t nearly as much fun 
as I thought it would be.” 

“This is not supposed to be 
fun,” the Dilettante informed her 
coldly. “It is in dead earnest. 
Since the question has been 
brought up, however, what did 
happen to you, Skkiru?” 

“I — er — fell down and, being a 
beggar, I had no other garments 
to change into.” 

“You’ll survive,” Bbulas said 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



unfeelingly. “On Earth, I under- 
stand, people fall into mud all the 
time. Supposed to have a benefi- 
cial effect — and any effect on 
you, Skkiru, would have to be 
beneficial.” 

Larhgan was opening her mouth 
to say something — probably, 
Skkiru thought fondly, in his de- 
fense— when there came a thud 
and a yell from the passage out- 
side. Two yells, in fact. And two 
thuds. 

“My faith,” exclaimed a Ter- 
restrial voice, “but how did the 
beggar descend! I am sure every 
bone in my body is broken.” 

“I think you’ll find him pos- 
sessed of means of locomotion not 
known to us. But you’re not hurt, 
old chap — only brxiised.” 

And Cyril came into the coun- 
cil chamber, followed by a limp- 
ing Raoul. “Good evening, ladies 
and gentlemen. I trust this is not 
an intrusion, although I’m quite 
sure you’ll tell us we’ve broken a 
whole slue of tabus.” 

“You!” Bbulas screamed at 
Skkiru. “You must have used the 
passage in the hut! You let them 
follow you!” 

Losing control of his own re- 
flexes, he began to whirl madly. 

^^TJUT regard this!” Raoul ex- 
^ claimed, staring around 
him. “To build a place like this 
beneath the mud — name of a 
name, these people must have hy- 

THE IGNOBLE SAVAGES 



draulic engineering far sujjerior 
to anything on Earth!” 

“You are too kind,” the former 
hydraulic engineer said deprecat- 
ingly. “Actually, it’s quite sim- 
ple-” 

“This is not a primitive civiliza- 
tion at all, Raoul,” Cyril ex- 
plained. “They’ve been faking it 
from tapes. Probably have a cul- 
ture very much like ours, with al- 
lowances for climatic differences, 
of course. Oh, undoubtedly it 
would be provincial, but — ” 

“We are not provincial,” Larh- 
gan said coldly. “Primitive, yes. 
Provincial, no! We are — ” 

“But why should they do a 
thing like this to us?” Raoul 
wailed. 

“I imagine they did it to get 
on the trade routes, as Nemeth 
did. They’ve been trying not to 
talk about Nemeth all the while. 
Must have been rather a strain. 
You ought to be ashamed of your- 
selves!” C3uil told the assembled 
Snaddrath. “Very bad form!” 
Bbulas was turning paler and 
paler as he whirled. “All your 
fault,” he gasp>ed hoarsely to 
Skkiru. “All your fault!” 

And that was true, Skkiru real- 
ized. His antennae quivered, but 
he didn’t even try to restrain 
them. He had meant well, yet he 
had messed up the planet’s af- 
fairs far more seriously than 
Bbulas had. He had ruined their 
hojjes, killed all their chances by 

35 



his carelessness. He, Skkiru, in- 
stead of being his planet’s savior, 
was its spoiler. He psonked vio- 
lently. 

But Larhgan moved nearer to 
him. “It’s all over, anyhow,” she 
whispered, “and you know what? 
I’m glad. I’m glad we failed. I’d 
rather starve as myself than suc- 
ceed as a sham.” 

Skkiru controlled himself. Si- 
lently, he took the grimpatch out 
of his carrier and, as silently, she 
took it back. 

“My faith, they must have had 
plumbing all the time!” Raoul 
complained. 

“Very likely,” said Cyril sternly. 
“Looks as if we’ve suffered for 
nothing.” 

“Such people!” Raoul said. 
“True primitives, I am sure, 
would never have behaved so un- 
feelingly!” 

Cyril smiled, but his face was 
hard as he turned back to the 
Snaddrath. “We’ll radio Gambrell 
in the morning to have a ship dis- 
patched to pick us up. I’m not 
sure but that we have a good case 
for fraud against you.” 

“We’re destroyed!” Bbulas 
shrieked as the full emotional im- 
pact of the situation hit him. “An 
interplanetary lawsuit would ruin 
Snaddra entirely.” 

His cries were echoed in the 
howls of the other Snaddrath, 
their antennae psonking, their 
eyes bulging. 

36 



A GONIZED by his sorrow, 
Bbulas lost all emotional re- 
straint, forgot about his Terres- 
trial training, and turned upside 
down in a spasm of grief. Since 
there was no longer any reason to 
repress their natural manifesta- 
tion of feeling, all the Snaddrath 
followed suit, their antennae 
twisting in frenzy as they ulu- 
lated. 

And then, to Skkiru’s surprise 
and the surprise of all the rest, 
Cyril stopped and took out his 
notebook. “Wait a minute,” he 
said as Raoul did likewise. All 
four Earthly eyes were shining 
with a glow that was recognizable 
to any even remotely humanoid 
species as the glow of intellectual 
fervor. “Wait just a minute! Our 
plans are altered. We may stay, 
after all!” 

One by one, the Snaddrath re- 
versed to upright positions, but 
did not retract their eyes, for they 
were still staring at the Earth- 
men. Skkiru knew now what had 
been bothering him about the 
Terrestrials all along. They were 
crazy — that was what it was. Who 
but maniacs would want to leave 
their warm, dry planets and go 
searching the stars for strange 
cultures, when they could stay 
quietly at home in peace and 
comfort with their families? 

Skkiru’s hand reached out for 
Larhgan’s and foimd it.

THE OTHER CELIA

Something drastic should happen 
to all snoopers — but nothing as 
shocking and frightful as thisl 

Illustrated by DILLON 



I F YOU live in a cheap 
enough rooming house and 
the doors are made of cheap 
enough pine, and the locks are 
old-fashioned single - action jobs 
and the hinges are loose, and if 
you have a hundred and ninety 
lean pounds to operate with, you 
can grasp the knob, press the door 
sidewise against its hinges, and 
slip the latch. Further, you can 
lock the door the same way when 
you come out. 

Slim Walsh lived in, and was, 
and had, and did these things 
partly because he was bored. The 



company doctors had laid him up 
— not off, up — for three weeks 
(after his helper had hit him just 
over the temple with a fourteen- 
inch crescent wrench) pending 
some more X-rays. If he was go- 
ing to get just sick-leave pay, he 
wanted to make it stretch. If he 
was going to get a big fat settle- 
ment-all to the good; what he 
saved by living in this firetrap 
would make the money look even 
better. Meanwhile, he felt fine 
and had nothing to do all day. 

“Slim isn’t dishonest,” his 
mother used to tell Children’s 



THE OTHER CELIA 



37 



Court some years back. “He’s just 
curious.” 

She was perfectly right. 

Slim was constitutionally in- 
capable of borrowing your bath- 
room without looking into your 
medicine chest. Send him into 
your kitchen for a saucer and 
when he came out a minute later, 
he’d have inventoried your re- 
frigerator, your vegetable bin, and 
(since he was six feet three inches 
tall) he would know about a 
moldering jar of maraschino cher- 
ries in the back of the top shelf 
that you’d forgotten about. 

Perhaps Slim, who was not im- 
pressed by his impressive size and 
build, felt that a knowledge that 
you secretly use hair-restorer, or 
are one of those strange people 
who keeps a little moimd of un- 
mated socks in your second 
drawer, gave him a kind of supe- 
riority. Or maybe security is a 
better word. Or maybe it was an 
odd compensation for one of the 
most advanced cases of gawking, 
gasping shyness ever recorded. 

Whatever it was, Slim liked 
you better if, while talking to you, 
he knew how many jackets hung 
in your closet, how old that un- 
paid phone bill was, and just 
where you’d hidden those photo- 
graphs. On the other hand. Slim 
didn’t insist on knowing bad or 
even embarrassing things about 
you. He just wanted to know 
things about you, period. 



H IS current situation was 
therefore a near - paradise. 
Flimsy doors stood in rows, 
barely sustaining vacuum on ach- 
ing vacuum of knowledge; and 
one by one they imploded at the 
nudge of his curiosity. He touched 
nothing (or if he did, he replaced 
it carefully) and removed noth- 
ing, and within a week he knew 
Mrs. Koyper’s roomers far better 
than she could, or cared to. Elach 
secret visit to the rooms gave him 
a starting point; subsequent ones 
taught him more. He knew not 
only what these people had, but 
what they did, where, how much, 
for how much, and how often. In 
almost every case, he knew why 
as well. 

Almost every case. Celia Sarton 
came. 

Now, at various times, in vari- 
ous places. Slim had foimd 
strange things in other people’s 
rooms. There was an old lady in 
one shabby place who had an 
electric train under her bed; used 
it, too. There was an old spinster 
in this very building who col- 
lected bottles, large and small, of 
any value or capacity, providing 
they were roimd and squat and 
with long necks. A man on the 
second floor secretly guarded his 
desirables with the unloaded .25 
automatic in his top bureau 
drawer, for which he had a half- 
box of .38 cartridges. 

There was a (to be chivalrous) 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



girl in one of the rooms who kept 
fresh cut flowers before a photo- 
graph on her night-table— or, 
rather, before a frame in which 
were stacked eight photographs, 
one of which held the stage each 
day. Seven days, eight photo- 
graphs: Slim admired the sys- 
tem. A new love every day and, 
predictably, a different love on 
successive Wednesdays. And all 
of them movie stars. 

Dozens of rooms, dozens of im- 
prints, marks, impressions, over- 
lays, atmospheres of people. And 
they needn’t be odd ones. A 
woman moves into a room, how- 
ever standardized; the instant she 
puts down her dusting powder on 
top of the flush tank, the room is 
hers. Something stuck in the ill- 
fitting frame of a mirror, some- 
thing draped over the long-dead 
gas jet, and the samest of rooms 
begins to shrink toward its occu- 
pant as if it wished, one day, to 
be a close-knit, form-fitting, indi- 
vidual integument as intimate as 
a skin. 

But not Celia Sarton’s room. 

Slim Walsh got a glimpse of 
her as she followed Mrs. Koyper 
up the stairs to the third floor. 
Mrs. Koyper, who hobbled, 
slowed any follower sufficiently to 
afford the most disinterested wit- 
ness a good look, and Slim was 
anything but disinterested. Yet 
for days he could not recall her 
clearly. It was as if Celia Sarton 



had been — not invisible, for that 
would have been memorable in 
itself — but translucent or, chame- 
leonlike, drably re-radiating the 
drab wall color, carpet color, 
woodwork color. 

She was— how old? Old enough 
to pay taxes. How tall? Tall 
enough. Dressed in . whatever 
women cover themselves with in 
their statistical thousands. Shoes, 
hose, skirt, jacket, hat. 

She carried a bag. When you 
go to the baggage window at a 
big terminal, you notice a suit- 
case here, a steamer-tnmk there; 
and all arovmd, high up, far back, 
there are rows and ranks and 
racks of luggage not individually 
noticed but just there. This bag, 
Celia Sarton’s bag, was one of 
them. 

And to Mrs. Koyper, she said 
— she said — She said whatever is 
necessary when one takes a cheap 
room; and to find her voice, di- 
vide the sound of a crowd by the 
number of people in it. 

CO ANONYMOUS, so unno- 
ticeable was she that, aside 
from being aware that she left in 
the morning and "etumed in the 
evening, Slim let two days go by 
before he entered her room; he 
simply could not remind himself 
about her. And when he did, and 
had inspected it to his satisfac- 
tion, he had his hand on the knob, 
about to leave, before he recalled 



THE OTHER CELIA 



39 



that the room was, after all, oc- 
cupied. Until that second, he had 
thought he was giving one of the 
vacancies the once-over. (He did 
this regularly; it gave him a ref- 
erence-point.) 

He grimted and turned back, 
flicking his gaze over the room. 
First he had to assure himself 
that he was in the right room, 
which, for a man of his instinctive 
orientations, was extraordinary. 
Then he had to spend a moment 
of disbelief in his own eyes, which 
was all but unthinkable. When 
that passed, he stood in astonish- 
ment, staring at the refutation of 
everything his — hobby — had 
taught him about people and the 
places they live in. 

The bureau drawers were 
empty. The ashtray was clean. 
No toothbrush, toothpaste, soap. 
In the closet, two wire hangers 
and one wooden one covered with 
dirty quilted silk, and nothing 
else. Under the grime-gray dresser 
scarf, nothing. In the shower stall, 
the medicine chest, nothing and 
nothing again, except what Mrs. 
Koyper had grudgingly installed. 

Slim went to the bed and care- 
fully turned back the faded cov- 
erlet. Maybe she had slept in it, 
but very fjossibly not; Mrs. Koy- 
per specialized in unironed sheets 
of such a ground-in gray that it 
wasn’t easy to tell. Frowning, Slim 
put up the coverlet again and 
smoothed it. 

40 



Suddenly he struck his fore- 
head, which yielded him a flash 
of pain from his injury. He ig- 
nored it. “The bag!” 

It was under the bed, shoved 
there, not hidden there. He looked 
at it without touching it for a 
moment, so that it could be re- 
turned exactly. Then he hauled it 
out. 

TT was a black gladstone, nei- 
ther new nor expensive, 
of that nondescript rusty color ac- 
quired by untended leatherette. It 
had a worn zipper closure and 
was not locked. Slim opened it. It 
contained a cardboard box, crisp 
and new, for a thousand virgin 
sheets of cheap white typewriter 
paper surrounded by a glossy 
bright blue band bearing a white 
diamond with the legend: Non- 
pareil the writers friend 15% 
cotton fiber trade mark registered. 

Slim lifted the paper out of the 
box, looked under it, riffled a 
thumbful of the sheets at the top 
and the same from the bottom, 
shook his head, replaced the 
paper, closed the box, put it back 
into the bag and restored every- 
thing precisely as he had found 
it. He paused again in the middle 
of the room, turning slowly once, 
but there was simply nothing else 
to look at. He let himself out, 
locked the door, and went silently 
back to his room. 

He sat down on the edge of his 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 












Wjt r ' 





THE OTHER CELIA 



41 




bed and at last protested, “No- 
body lives like that!” 

TT IS room was on the fourth 
and topmost floor of the old 
house. Anyone else would have 
called it the worst room in the 
place. It was small, dark, shabby 
and remote and it suited him 
beautifully. Its door had a tran- 
som, the glass of which had many 
times been painted over. 

By standing on the foot of his 
bed. Slim could apply one eye to 
the peephole he had scratched in 
the paint and look straight down 
the stairs to the third-floor land- 
ing. On this landing, hanging to 
the stub of one of the ancient gas 
jets, was a cloudy mirror sur- 
mounted by a dust-mantled gilt 
eagle and surrounded by a great 
many rococo carved flowers. By 
careful propping with folded ciga- 
rette wrappers, innumerable tests 
and a great deal of silent milage 
up and down the stairs. Slim had 
.arranged the exact tilt necessary 
in the mirror so that it covered 
the second floor landing as well. 

And just as a radar operator 
learns to translate glowing pips 
and masses into aircraft and 
weather, so Slim became expert 
at the interpretation of the fogged 
and distant image it afforded him. 
Thus he had the comings and go- 
ings of half the tenants xmder sur- 
veillance without having to leave 
his room. 

42 



It was in this mirror, at twelve 
minutes past six, that he saw 
Celia Sarton next, and as he 
watched her climb the stairs, his 
eyes glowed. 

The anonymity was gone. She 
came up the stairs two at a time, 
with a gait like bounding. She 
reached the landing and whirled 
into her corridor and was gone, 
and while a part of Slim’s mind 
listened for the way she opened 
her door (hurriedly, rattling the 
key against the lock-plate, bang- 
ing the door open, slamming it 
shut), another part studied a 
mental photograph of her face. 

What raised its veil of the sta- 
tistical ordinary was its set pur- 
pose. Here were eyes only super- 
ficially interested in cars, curbs, 
stairs, doors. It was as if she had 
projected every important part of 
herself into that empty room of 
hers and waited there impatiently 
for her body to catch up. There 
was something in the room, or 
something she had to do there, 
which she could not, would not, 
wait for. One goes this way to a 
beloved after a long parting, or 
to a deathbed in the last, precipi- 
tous moments. This was not the 
arrival of one who wants, but of 
one who needs. 

Slim buttoned his shirt, eased 
his door open and sidled through 
it. He poised a moment on his 
landing like a great moose sensing 
the air before descending to a 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



waterhole, and then moved down- 
stairs. 

Celia Sarton’s only neighbor in 
the north corridor — the spinster 
with the bottles — was settled for 
the evening; she was of very reg- 
ular habits and Slim knew them 
well. 

Completely confident that he 
would not be seen, he drifted to 
the girl’s door and paused. 

S HE was there, all right. He 
could see the light around the 
edges of the ill-fitting door, could 
sense that difference between an 
occupied room and an empty one, 
which exists however silent the 
occupant might be. And this one 
was silent. Whatever it was that 
had driven her into the room with 
such headlong urgency, whatever 
it was she was doing (had to do) 
was being done with no sound or 
motion that he could detect. 

For a long time — six minutes, 
seven — Slim hung there, open- 
throated to conceal the sound of 
his breath. At last, shaking his 
head, he withdrew, climbed the 
stairs, let himself into his own 
room and lay down on the bed, 
frowning. 

He could only wait. Yet he 
could wait. No one does any sin- 
gle thing for very long. Especially 
a thing not involving movement. 
In an hour, in two — 

It was five. At half-past eleven, 
some faint sound from the floor 



below brought Slim, half-dozing, 
twisting up from the bed and to 
his high peephole in the transom. 
He saw the Sarton girl come out 
of the corridor slowly, and stop, 
and look around at nothing in 
particular, like someone confined 
too long in a ship’s cabin who has 
emerged on deck, not so much for 
the lungs’ sake, but for the eyes’. 
And when she went down the 
stairs, it was easily and without 
hurry, as if (again) the impor- 
tant part of her was in the room. 
But the something was finished 
with for now and what was ahead 
of her wasn’t important and could 
wait. 

Standing with his hand on his 
own doorknob. Slim decided that 
he, too, could wait. The tempta- 
tion to go straight to her room 
was, of course, large, but caution 
also loomed. What he had tenta- 
tively established as her habit 
patterns did not include midnight 
exits. 

He could not know when 
she might come back and it would 
be foolish indeed to jeopardize his 
hobby — not only where it in- 
cluded her, but all of it — by be- 
ing caught. He sighed, mixing 
resignation with anticipatory 
pleasure, and went to bed. 

Less than fifteen minutes later, 
he congratulated himself with a 
sleepy smile as he heard her slow 
footsteps mount the stair below. 
He slept. 



THE OTHER CELIA 



43 



^ I ^ HERE was nothing in the 
closet, there was nothing in 
the ashtray, there was nothing in 
the medicine chest nor under the 
dresser scarf. The bed was made, 
the dresser drawers were empty, 
and under the bed was the cheap 
gladstone. In it was a box con- 
taining a thousand sheets of typ- 
ing paper surrounded by a glossy 
blue band. Without disturbing 
this. Slim riffled the sheets, once 
at the top, once at the bottom. He 
grunted, shook his head and then 
proceeded, automatically but me- 
ticulously, to put everything back 
as he had found it. 

“Whatever it is this girl does at 
night,” he said glumly, “it leaves 
tracks like it makes noise.” 

He left. 

The rest of the day was unusu- 
ally busy for Slim. In the morning 
he had a doctor’s appointment, 
and in the afternoon he spent 
hours with a company lawyer 
who seemed determined to (a) 
deny the existence of any head 
injury and (b) prove to Slim and 
the world that the injury must 
have occurred years ago. He got 
absolutely nowhere. If Slim had 
another characteristic as consum- 
ing and compulsive as his curios- 
ity, it was his shyness; these two 
could stand on one another’s 
shoulders, though, and still look 
upward at Slim’s stubbornness. It 
served its purpose. It took hours, 
however, and it was after seven 

44 



when he got home. 

He paused at the third-floor 
landing and glanced down the 
corridor. Celia Sarton’s room was 
occupied and silent. If she 
emerged around midnight, ex- 
hausted and relieved, then he 
would know she had again raced 
up the stairs to her urgent, mo- 
tionless task, whatever it was . 
and here he checked himself. He 
had long ago learned the useless- 
ness of cluttering up his busy 
head with conjectures. A thou- 
sand things might happen; in each 
case, only one would. He would 
wait, then, and could. 

And again, some hours later, he 
saw her come out of her corridor. 
She looked about, but he knew 
she saw very little; her face was 
withdrawn and her eyes wide and 
unguarded. Then, instead of going 
out, she went back into her room. 

He slipped downstairs half an 
hour later and listened at her 
door, and smiled. She was wash- 
ing her lingerie at the handbasin. 
It was a small thing to learn, but 
he felt he was making progress. 
It did not explain why she lived 
as she did, but indicated how she 
could manage without so much as 
a spare handkerchief. 

Oh, well, maybe in the morning. 

TN THE morning, there was no 

maybe. He found it, he found 
it, though he could not know what 
it was he’d found. He laughed at 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



first, not in triumph but wryly, 
calling himself a clown. Then he 
squatted on his heels in the mid- 
dle of the floor (he would not sit 
on the bed, for fear of leaving 
wrinkles of his own on those Mrs. 
Koyper supplied) and carefully 
lifted the box of paper out of the 
suitcase and put it on the floor in 
front of him. 

Up to now, he had contented 
himself with a quick riffle of the 
blank paper, a little at the top, a 
little at the bottom. He had done 
just this again, without removing 
the box from the suitcase, but only 
taking the top off and tilting up 
the banded ream of Nonpareil- 
the-writers-friend. And almost in 
spite of itself, his quick eye had 
caught the briefest flash of pale 
blue. 

Gently, he removed the band, 
sliding it off the pack of paper, 
being careful not to slit the glossy 
finish. Now he could freely riffle 
the pages, and when he did, he 
discovered that all of them except 
a hundred or so, top and bottom, 
had the same rectangular cut-out, 
leaving only a narrow margin all 
the way around. In the hollow 
space thus formed, something was 
packed. 

He could not tell what the 
something was, except that it was 
pale tan, with a tinge of pink, 
and felt like smooth untextured 
leather. There was a lot of it, 
neatly folded so that it exactly 



fitted the hole in the ream of 
paper. 

He puzzled over it for some 
minutes without touching it again, 
and then, scrubbing his fingertips 
against his shirt until he felt that 
they were quite free of moisture 
and grease, he gently worked 
loose the top comer of the sub- 
stance and unfolded a layer. All 
he found was more of the same. 

He folded it down flat again to 
be sure he could, and then 
brought more of it out. He soon 
realized that the material was of 
an irregular shape and almost cer- 
tainly of one piece, so that folding 
it into a tight rectangle required 
care and great skill. Therefore he 
proceeded very slowly, stopping 
every now and then to fold it up 
again, and it took him more than 
an hour to get enough of it out 
so that he could identify it. 

Identify? It was completely un- 
like anything he had ever seen 
before. 

It was a human skin, done in 
some substance very like the real 
thing. The first fold, the one 
which had been revealed at first, 
was an area of the back, which 
was why it showed no features. 
One might liken it to a balloon, 
except that a deflated balloon is 
smaller in every dimension than 
an inflated one. As far as Slim 
could judge, this was life-sized — 
a little over five feet long and pro- 
portioned accordingly. The hair

was peculiar, looking exactly like 
the real thing until flexed, and 
then revealing itself to be one 
piece. 

It had Celia Sarton’s face. 

Slim closed hisoyes and opened 
them, and found that it was still 
true. He held his breath and put 
forth a careful, steady forefinger 
and gently pressed the left eyelid 
upward. There was an eye under 
it, all right, light blue and seem- 
ingly moist, but flat. 

Slim released the breath, closed 
the eye and sat back on his heels. 
His feet were beginning to tingle 
from his having knelt on the floor 
for so long. 

TJ E looked all around the room 
once, to clear his head of 
strangeness, and then began to 
fold the thing up again. It took 
a while, but when he was finished, 
he knew he had it right. He re- 
placed the typewriter paper in 
the box and the box in the bag, 
put the bag away and at last 
stood in the middle of the room 
in the suspension which overcame 
him when he was deep in thought. 

After a moment of this, he be- 
gan to inspect the ceiling. It was 
made of stamped tin, like those 
of many old-fashioned houses. It 
was grimy and flaked and stained; 
here and there, rust showed 
through, and in one or two places, 
edges of the tin sheets had 
sagged. Slim nodded to himself 



in profound satisfaction, listened 
for a while at the door, let him- 
self out, locked it and went up- 
stairs. 

He stood in his own corridor 
for a minute, checking the posi- 
tion of doors, the hall window, 
and his accurate orientation of 
the same things on the floor be- 
low. Then he went into his own 
room. 

His room, though smaller than 
most, was one of the few in the 
house which was blessed with a 
real closet instead of a rickety 
off-the-floor wardrobe. He went 
into it and knelt, and grunted in 
satisfaction when he found how 
loose the ancient, unpainted floor- 
boards were. By removing the 
side baseboard, he found it pos- 
sible to get to the air-space be- 
tween the fourth floor and the 
third-floor ceiling. 

He took out boards until he 
had an opening perhaps fourteen 
inches wide, and then, working 
in almost total silence, he began 
cleaning away dirt and old plas- 
ter. He did this meticulously, be- 
cause when he finally pierced the 
tin sheeting, he wanted not one 
grain of dirt to fall into the room 
below. He took his time and it 
was late in the afternoon when 
he was satisfied with his prepara- 
tions and began, with his knife, 
on the tin. 

It was thinner and softer than 
he had dared to hop>e; he almost 



46

overcut on the first try. Carefully 
he squeezed the sharp steel into 
the little slot he had cut, length- 
ening it. When it was somewhat 
less than an inch long, he with- 
drew all but the point of the 
knife and twisted it slightly, 
moved it a sixteenth of an inch 
and twisted again, repeating this 
all down the cut until he had 
widened it enough for his pur- 
poses. 

He checked the time, then re- 
turned to Celia Sarton’s room 
for just long enough to check the 
appearance of his work from that 
side. He was very pleased with it. 
The little cut had come through 
a foot away from the wall over 
the bed and was a mere p>encil 
line lost in the baroque design 
with which the tin was stamped 
and the dirt and rust that marred 
it. He returned to his room and 
sat down to wait. 

He heard the old house coming 
to its evening surge of life, a 
voice here, a door there, footsteps 
on the stairs. He ignored them all 
as he sat on the edge of his bed, 
hands folded between his knees, 
eyes half closed, immobile like 
a machine fueled, oiled, timed 
and ready, lacking only the right 
touch on the right control. And 
like that touch, the faint sound 
of Celia Sarton’s footsteps moved 
him. 

To use his new peephole, he 
had to lie on the floor half in and 



half out of the closet, with his 
head in the hole, actually below 
floor level. With this, he was 
perfectly content, any amount of 
discomfort being well worth his 
trouble — an attitude he shared 
with many another ardent hobby- 
ist, mountain-climber or speleol- 
ogist, duck-hunter or bird-watcher. 

Vj^ HEN she turned on the light, 
” he could see her splendidly, 
as well as most of the floor, the 
lower third of the door and part 
of the washbasin in the bathroom. 

She had come in hurriedly, 
with that same agonized haste he 
had observed before. At the same 
second she turned on the light, 
she had apparently flung her 
handbag toward the bed; it was 
in midair as the light appeared. 
She did not even glance its way, 
but hastily fumbled the old glad- 
stone from under the bed, opened 
it, removed the box, opened it, 
took out the paper, slipped off the 
blue band and removed the blank 
sheets of paper which covered 
the hollowed-out ream. 

She scooped out the thing hid- 
den there, shaking it once like a 
grocery clerk with a folded paper 
sack, so that the long limp thing 
straightened itself out. She ar- 
ranged it carefully on the worn 
linoleum of the floor, arms down 
at the side, legs slightly apart, 
face up, neck straight. Then she 
lay down on the floor, too, head-

to-head with the deflated thing. 
She reached up over her head, 
took hold of the collapsed image 
of herself about the region of the 
ears, and for a moment did some 
sort of manipulation of it against 
the top of her own head. 

Slim heard faintly a sharp, 
chitinous click, like the sound 
one makes by snapping the edge 
of a thumbnail against the edge 
of a fingernail. 

Her hands slipped to the cheeks 
of the figure and she pulled at 
the empty head as if testing a 
connection. The head seemed now 
to have adhered to hers. 

Then she assumed the same 
pose she had arranged for this 
other, letting her hands fall wear- 
ily to her sides on the floor, clos- 
ing her eyes. 

For a long while, nothing 
seemed to be happening, except 
for the odd way she was breath- 
ing, very deeply but very slowly, 
like the slow-motion picture of 
someone panting, gasping for 
breath after a long hard run. 
After perhaps ten minutes of this, 
the breathing became shallower 
and even slower, until, at the end 
of a half hour, he could detect 
none at all. 

Slim lay there immobile for 
more than an hour, until his body 
shrieked protest and his head 
ached from eyestrain. He hated 
to move, but move he must. 
Silently he backed out of the 

48 



closet, stood up and stretched. It 
was a great luxury and he deeply 
enjoyed it. He felt moved to 
think over what he had just 
seen, but clearly and consciously 
decided not to — not yet, ansrway. 

When he was unkinked, again, 
he crept back into the closet, put 
his head in the hole and his eye 
to the slot. 

Nothing had changed. She still 
lay quiet, utterly relaxed, so much 
so that her hands had turned 
palm upward. 

Slim watched and he watched. 
Just as he was about to conclude 
that this was the way the girl 
spent her entire nights and that 
there would be nothing more to 
see, he saw a slight and sudden 
contraction about the region of 
her solar plexus, and then another. 
For a time, there was nothing 
more, and then the empty thing 
attached to the top of her head 
began to fill. 

And Celia Sarton began to 
empty. 

Slim stopped breathing until 
it hurt and watched in total as- 
tonishment. 

/~kNCE it had started, the proc- 
ess progressed swiftly. It was 
as if something passed from the 
clothed body of the girl to this 
naked empty thing. The some- 
thing, whatever it might be, had 
to be fluid, for nothing but a 
fluid would fill a flexible con- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tainer in just this way, or make a 
flexible container slowly and 
evenly flatten out like this. Slim 
could see the fingers, which had 
been folded flat against the palms, 
inflate and move until they took 
on the normal relaxed curl of a 
normal hand. The elbows shifted 
a little to lie more normally 
against the body. And yes, it was 
a body now. 

The other one was not a body 
any more. It lay foolishly limp 
in its garments, its sleeping face 
slightly distorted by its flatten- 
ing. The fingers fell against the 
palms by their own limp weight. 
The shoes thumped quietly on 
their sides, heels together, toes 
pointing in opposite directions. 

The exchange was done in less 
than ten minutes and then the 
newly filled body moved. 

It flexed its hands tentatively, 
drew up its knees and stretched 
its legs out again, arched its back 
against the floor. Its eyes flickered 
open. It put up its arms and made 
some deft manipulation at the 
top of its head. Slim heard 
another version of the soft-hard 
click and the now-empty head 
fell flat to the floor. 

The new Celia Sarton sat up 
and sighed and rubbed her hands 
lightly over her body, as if re- 
storing circulation and sensation 
to a chilled skin. She stretched as 
comfortingly and luxuriously as 
Slim had a few minutes earlier. 



She looked rested and refreshed. 

At the top of her head. Slim 
caught a glimpse of a slit through 
which a wet whiteness showed, 
but it seemed to be closing. In a 
brief time, nothing showed there 
but a small valley in the hair, like 
a normal parting. 

She sighed again and got up. 
She took the clothed thing on the 
floor by the neck, raised it and 
shook it twice to make the clothes 
fall away. She tossed it to the bed 
and carefully picked up the 
clothes and deployed them about 
the room, the undergarments in 
the washbasin, the dress and slip 
on a hanger in the wardrobe. 

Moving leisurely but with pur- 
pose, she went into the bathroom 
and, except for her shins down, 
out of Slim’s range of vision. 
There he heard the same faint 
domestic sounds he had once 
detected outside her door, as she 
washed her underclothes. She 
emerged in due course, went to 
the wardrobe for some wire hang- 
ers and took them into the bath- 
room. Back she came with the 
underwear folded on the hangers, 
which she hooked to the top of 
the open wardrobe door. Then she 
took the deflated integument 
which lay crumpled on the bed, 
shook it again, rolled it up into a 
ball and took it into the bath- 
room. 

Slim heard more water-running 
and sudsing noises, and, by ear. 



THE OTHER CELIA

followed the operation through a 
soaping and two rinses. Then she 
came out again, shaking out the 
object, which had apparently just 
been wrung, pulled it through a 
wooden clothes-hanger, arranged 
it creaselessly depending from the 
crossbar of the hanger with the 
bar about at its waistline, and 
hung it with the others on the 
wardrobe door. 

Then she lay down on the bed, 
not to sleep or to read or even 
to rest — she seemed very rested 
— but merely to wait until it was 
time to do something else. 

"O Y now. Slim’s bones were com- 
plaining again, so he wormed 
noiselessly backward out of his 
lookout point, got into his shoes 
and a jacket, and went out to get 
something to eat. When he came 
home an hour later and looked, 
her light was out and he could 
see nothing. He spread his over- 
coat carefully over the hole in 
the closet so no stray light from 
his room would appear in the 
little slot in the ceiling, closed 
the door, read a comic book for 
a while, and went to bed. 

The next day, he followed her. 
What strange occupation she 
might have, what weird vampiric 
duties she might disclose, he did 
not speculate on. He was dogged- 
ly determined to gather informa- 
tion first and think later. 

What he foimd out about her 



daytime activities was, if any- 
thing, more surprising than any 
wild surmise. She was a clerk in 
a small five-and-ten on the East 
Side. She ate in the store’s lunch 
bar at lunchtime — a green salad 
and a surprising amount of milk 

— and in the evening she stopped 
at a hot-dog stand and drank a 
small container of milk, though 
she ate nothing. 

Her steps were slowed by then 
and she moved wearily, speeding 
up only when she was close to 
the rooming house, and then ap- 
parently- all but overcome with 
eagerness to get home and . 
into something more comfortable. 
She was watched in this process, 
and Slim, had he disbelieved his 
own eyes the first time, must be- 
lieve them now. 

So it went for a week, three 
days of which Slim spent in 
shadowing her, every evening in 
watching her make her strange 
toilet. Every twenty-four hours, 
she changed bodies, carefully 
washing, drying, folding and put- 
ting away the one she was not 
using. 

Twice during the week, she 
went out for what was apparently 
a constitutional and nothing more 

— a half-hour around midnight, 
when she would stand on the 
walk in front of the rooming 
house, or wander aroimd the 
block. 

At work, she was silent but 



so 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



not unnaturally so; she spoke, 
when spoken to, in a small, un- 
musical voice. She seemed to have 
no friends; she maintained her 
aloofness by being uninteresting 
and by seeking no one out and 
by needing no one. She evinced 
no outside interests, never going 
to the movies or to the park. She 
had no dates, not even with girls. 
Slim thought she did not sleep, 
but lay quietly in the dark wait- 
ing for it to be time to get up 
and go to work. 

And when he came to think 
about it, as ultimately he did, it 
occurred to Slim that within the 
anthill in which we all live and 
have our being, enough privacy 
can be exacted to allow for all 
sorts of strangeness in the mem- 
bers of society, providing the 
strangeness is not permitted to 
show. If it is a man’s pleasure 
to sleep upside-down like a bat, 
and if he so arranges his life that 
no one ever sees him sleeping, 
or his sleeping-place, why, batlike 
he may sleep all the days of his 
life. 

One need not, by these rules, 
even be a human being. Not if 
the mimicry is good enough. It is 
a measure of Slim’s odd person- 
ality to report that Celia Sarton’s 
ways did not frighten him. He 
was, if anything, less disturbed by 
her now than he’d been before he 
had begun to spy on her. He knew 
what she did in her room and how 



she lived. Before, he had not 
known. Now he did. This made 
him much happier. 

XTE was, however, still curious. 

His curiosity would never 
drive him to do what another man 
might — to spieak to her on the 
stairs or on the street, get to know 
her and more about her. He was 
too shy for that. Nor was he 
moved to report to anyone the 
odd practice he watched each 
evening. It wasn’t his business to 
report. She was doing no harm 
as far as he could see. In his 
cosmos, everybody had a right 
to live and make a buck if they 
could. 

Yet his curiosity, its immediacy 
taken care of, did undergo a 
change. It was not in him to 
wonder what sort of being this 
was and whether its ancestors 
had grown up among human 
beings, living with them in caves 
and in tents, developing and 
evolving along with homo sap 
until it could assume the uniform 
of the smallest and most invisible 
of wage-workers. He would never 
reach the conclusion that in the 
fight for survival, a species might 
discover that a most excellent 
characteristic for survival among 
human beings might be not to 
fight them but to join them. 

No, Slim’s curiosity was far 
simpler, more basic and less in- 
formed than any of these con- 



THE OTHER CELIA 



51 



jectures. He simply changed the 
field of his wonderment from 
■what to what it? 

So it was that on the eighth 
day of his survey, a Tuesday, 
he went again to her room, got 
the bag, opened it, removed the 
box, opened it, removed the ream 
of paper, slid the blue band off, 
removed the covering sheets, took 
out the second Celia Sarton, put 
her on the bed and then replaced 
paper, blue band, box-cover, box, 
and bag just as he had found 
them. He put the folded thing 
under his shirt and went out, 
carefully locking the door be- 
hind him in his special way, and 
went upstairs to his room. He put 
his prize imder the four clean 
shirts in his bottom drawer and 
sat down to await Celia Sarton’s 
homecoming. 

She was a little late that night 
— twenty minutes, perhaps. The 
delay seemed to have increased 
both her fatigue and her eager- 
ness; she burst in feverishly, 
moved with the rapidity of near- 
panic. She looked drawn and pale 
and her hands shook. She fumbled 
the bag from imder the bed, 
snatched out the box and opened 
it, contrary to her usual measured 
movements, by inverting it over 
the bed and dumping out its 
contents. 

When she saw nothing there 
but sheets of paper, some with a 
wide rectangle cut from them and 

52 



some without, she froze. She 
crouched over that bed without 
moving for an interminable two 
minutes. Then she straightened 
up slowly and glanced about the 
room. Once she fumbled through 
the paper, but resignedly, with- 
out hope. She made one sound, a 
high, sad whimper, and, from that 
moment on, was silent. 

She went to the window slowly, 
her feet dragging, her shoulders 
slumped. For a long time, she 
stood looking out at the city, its 
growing darkness, its growing 
colonies of lights, each a symbol 
of life and life’s usages. Then she 
drew down the blind and went 
back to the bed. 

Che stacked the papers there 
with loose uncaring fingers 
and put the heap of them on the 
dresser. She took off her shoes 
and placed them neatly side by 
side on the floor by the bed. She 
lay down in the same utterly re- 
laxed pose she affected when she 
made her change, hands down 
and open, legs a little apart. 

Her face looked like a death- 
mask, its tissues sunken and 
sagging. It was flushed and sick- 
looking. There was a little of the 
deep regular breathing, but only 
a little. There was a bit of the 
fluttering contractions at the mid- 
riff, but only a bit. Then — 
nothing. 

Slim backed away from the 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



peephole and sat up. He felt very 
bad about this. He had been only 
curious; he hadn’t wanted her to 
get sick, to die. For he was sure 
she had died. How could he know 
what sort of sleejvsurrogate an 
organism like this might require, 
or what might be the results of 
a delay in changing? What could 
he know of the chemistry of such 
a being? He had thought vaguely 
of slipping down the next day 
while she was out and returning 
her property. Just to see. Just to 
know what if. Just out of curi- 
osity. 

Should he call a doctor? 

She hadn’t. She hadn’t even 
tried, though she must have 
known much better than he did 
how serious her predicament was. 
(Yet if a species depended for 
its existence on secrecy, it would 
be species-survival to let an in- 
dividual die undetected.) Well, 
maybe not calling a doctor meant 
that she’d be all right, after all. 
Doctors would have a lot of silly 
questions to ask. She might even 
tell the doctor about her other 
skin, and if Slim was the one who 
had fetched the doctor. Slim 
might be questioned about that 

Slim didn’t want to get in- 
volved with an5rthing. He just 
wanted to know things. 

He thought, “Fll take another 
look.” 

He crawled back into the 
closet and put his head in the 



hole. Celia Sarton, he knew in- 
stantly, would not survive this. 
Her face was swollen, her eyes 
protruded, and her purpled tongue 
lolled far — too far — from the 
comer of her mouth. Even as he 
watched, her face darkened still 
more and the skin of it crinkled 
until it looked like carbon paper 
which has been balled up tight 
and then smoothed out. 

The very beginnings of an im- 
pulse to snatch the thing she 
needed out of his shirt drawer 
and rush it down to her died 
within him, for he saw a wisp of 
smoke emerge from her nostrils 
and then — 

Slim cried out, snatched his 
head from the hole, bumping it 
cruelly, and clapped his hands 
over his eyes. Put the biggest size 
flash-bulb an inch from your nose, 
and fire it, and you might get 
a flare approaching the one he 
got through his little slot in the 
tin ceiling. 

He sat grunting in pain and 
watching, on the insides of his 
eyelids, migrations of flaming 
worms. At last they faded and 
he tentatively opened his eyes. 
They hurt and the after-image 
of the slot hung before him, but 
at least he could see. 

Feet pounded on the stairs. He 
smelled smoke and a burned, 
oily unpleasant something which 
he could not identify. Someone 
shouted. Someone hammered on

a door. Then someone screamed 
and screamed. 

TT was in the papers next day. 

Mysterious, the story said. 
Charles Fort, in Lo!, had rep>orted 
many such cases and there had 
been others since— people burned 
to a crisp by a fierce heat which 
had nevertheless not destroyed 
clothes or bedding, while leaving 
nothing for autopsy. This was, 
said the paper, either an un- 
known kind of heat or heat of 
such intensity and such brevity 
that it would do such a thing. No 
known relatives, it said. Police 



mystified— no clues or suspects. 

Slim didn’t say ansrthing to 
anybody. He wasn’t curious about 
the matter any more. He closed 
up the hole in the closet that 
same night, and next day, after 
he read the story, he used the 
newspaper to wrap up the thing 
in his shirt drawer. It smelled 
pretty bad and, even that early, 
was too far gone to be unfolded. 
He dropped it into a garbage can 
on the way to the lawyer’s office 
on Wednesday. 

They settled his law suit that 
afternoon and he moved.

interesting story how all the multi- 
tudinous misunderstandings sur- 
rounding the Great Pyramid orig- 
inated. 

That the pyramid of King 
Khufu was a major engineering 
and organizational accomplish- 
ment is something that does not 
need to be stressed. 

It is not only astonishing that 
a structure of such size was built 
as early as it was; it is also aston- 
ishing how well it was built. As a 
matter of fact, Khufu’s pyramid 
is of better workmanship than 
the later pyramids built on the 
same plateau, the so-called pyra- 
mid plateau of Giza, about six 
miles to the west of Cairo. Since 
Khufu was the first to build a 
pyramid in this particular local- 
ity, the whole plateau was origi- 
nally named after him. It was 
called Akhet Khufu, or “Khufu’s 
Horizon.” 

W HY Khufu picked this par- 
ticular locality for his pyra- 
mid is not known. That is, we 
don’t know of any inscription say- 
ing that Pharaoh decreed this 
site because his fellow gods had 
told him to begin his soul-voyage 
after death from this place. But 
we can think of a number of emi- 
nently practical reasons why he 
chose this spot. 

To begin with, he could see it 
from his summer palace and 
watch the actual work going on. 

56 



Secondly, the location of the 
building site was such that, when 
the annual Nile flood occurred, 
the blocks of stone could be 
floated on rafts to the foot of the 
growing structure. Finally, most 
Egyptologists (and especially the 
Egyptian egyptologists) believe 
that Khufu’s pyramid hides an 
outcropping of natural rock which 
obviously saved that much work 
in the erection of a virtually solid 
structure. 

Even so, 2,300,000 blocks of 
stone went into the psn'amid, aver- 
aging 2 V 2 tons in weight, with a 
few that must weigh about 15 
tons each. The rock was quarried 
nearby. Professor Selim Hassan 
found some ancient quarries 
within easy walking distance of 
the pyramid. 

Originally the pyramid had an 
outer casing of white limestone — 
Greek writers who saw it blinding 
white under the desert sun as- 
sumed that it was white limestone 
all the way through — which is 
now gone. Not completely gone, 
though; it merely is no longer a 
part of Khufu’s pyramid, but 
forms portions of still-standing 
mosques. 

Without its casing, the pyramid 
is 450 feet tall. We can’t tell pre- 
cisely how high it was originally. 

The white limestone came from 
Turah, somewhat farther south 
and on the other side of the river, 
involving transportation over 14 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



miles of water. Some of the gran- 
ite used in the interior came from 
Aswan, a good distance up-river, 
but again with the possibility of 
water transport. 

It was the height of the struc- 
ture which is responsible for its 
name. The Egyptians called this 
height pyr-em-us. The Greeks 
adapted the term to their tongue

by pronouncing it pyramis and 
using it as a designation for that 
particular shape. Herodotus 
coined a plural, pyramides, from 
which, at a much later date, the 
current singular “pyramid” was 
derived. 

Since we are on the subject of 
names, I am sorry to report that 
we don’t really know how the 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



name of the king was pronounced. 
The written form (Fig. 1) trans- 
literates as Hwfw which, in order 
to be able to say it at all, is pro- 
nounced Khufu. Cheops (the “ch” 
should also be sounded as “kh”) is 
the Greek form used by Herodo- 
tus. 

ERODOTUS, incidentally, 
seems to have been the first 
who told stories about the P3nra- 
mid which do not strictly jibe 
with the truth. 

“One of the most frequently re- 
peated stories,” to quote Prof. 
Hassan Selim, from an article in 
the Egyptian monthly The Scribe, 
February, 1956, “is that in order 
to build the p 3 Tamid, Khufu 
closed the temples and enslaved 
the whole population to work as 
slave-laborers on its construction. 
This story has been going the 
rounds since the middle of the 
Fifth Century B. C., when the 
Greek traveler and historian He- 
rodotus visited Egypt and evi- 
dently fell into the hands of a 
typical dragoman, who, like his 
modern descendants, thought that 
a few sensational stories would 
earn him a bigger tip from the 
gullible stranger.” 

They probably did, but because 
more than a score of centuries had 
gone by since the actual work, the 
Egyptian may easily have be- 
lieved his own stories. 

A dozen centuries after Herod- 

57 




otus, other travelers came and 
saw the pyramids. Apparently no 
stories were told any more, and 
though the travelers probably saw 
examples of hieroglsqjhic writing, 
there was nobody on Earth then 
who could read it. Consequently 
they wondered about the nature 
and the purpose of these struc- 
tures. 

Christian travelers, remember- 
ing their Bible, theorized that 
these must have been the giant 
storehouses for grain which Jos- 
eph had built to combat the 
forthcoming seven-year famine. 
Moslem philosophers remembered 
the older writings, too, but 
evolved a different explanation. 
There may have been kings not 
mentioned in these writings and 
the prophets of these kings must 
have told them about the future 
coming of the deluge. The kings 
then ordered the pyramids built 
as refuges from the coming flood. 

Some less learned people rea- 
soned that an 3 dhing so massive 
must guard great wealth in gold 
and jewels, and they drew prac- 
tical conclusions from their opin- 
ion, sometimes with success. 

All these speculations dealt 
with pyramids in general, the 
pyramids of Egypt which extend 
over an area of 40 miles from 
north to south along the Nile (ten 
times as much if you include a 
few far to the south near Thebes 
and Edfu). The speculations of 

58 



the last century are restricted to 
just one p 5 Tamid, that of Khufu. 

The one who started it may have 
been, in all innocence, the famous 
astronomer Sir William Herschel. 
In his time, nobody knew just 
how old the pyramids were. The 
only thing that was certain was 
that they had already been old in 
the time of Herodotus. Herschel, 
learning that the entrance to the 
pyramid of Khufu formed a 
rather steep incline, may have 
been reminded of his telescopes 
and he wondered which star one 
might see if one were standing on 
the bottom of the entrance. 

Some rather tedious calcula- 
tions provided an answer. Look- 
ing through that shaft, an ob- 
server would have seen the star 
alpha Draconis, if the year were 
2160 B. C. Herschel then stated 
that the pyramid may have been 
built in that year. 

We now know that it is much 
older. 

"DUT Herschel’s attempt to date 
the building of the pyramid 
on astronomical grounds took 
hold — long after his death. 

It was in 1859 that John Tay- 
lor, a London publisher and book- 
dealer, published a book which 
he had written himself. It bore 
the title The Great Pyramid, 
Why was it built and Who built 
it? His conclusion was that the 
pyramid had been built for the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



purpose of embodying a few im- 
portant measurements. If Taylor 
had been an American, he might 
have said that it was the Egyp- 
tian equivalent of the Bureau of 
Standards, with the additional 
twist that all the standards are 
“classified information” not meant 
for the average dumb citizen. 

In the course of his romancing, 
John Taylor discovered that the 
Egyptians must have used the 
same units of measurement as the 
English — or at least the more 
important of these units — and he 
succeeded in finding a imit which 
had been lost. In England at that 
time, a Quarter was used as a 
measurement for wheat. Taylor 
said, “A quarter of what?” and 
found the answer: The original 
‘Svhole,” four Quarters of wheat, 
was the “so-called” sarcophagus 
of the pharaoh. 

Taylor also found that the 
height of the pyramid (which he 
overestimated by a few feet) was 
1/270,000 of the circumference of 
the Earth. Here one can only say, 
“Why not?” for the height of the 
pyramid obviously must be some 
fraction of the circumference (or 
of the diameter) of the Earth. 

Taylor was willing to admit 
that a few such things could be 
coincidences. To feel sure that it 
was planned, he looked for some- 
thing which could not be a coin- 
cidence — or so he thought — 
and he found one, too. The square 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



of the height of the pyramid, com- 
pared to the area of one of its tri- 
angular faces, demonstrated the 
“golden section.” 

That “golden section” had been 
around ever since the days of 
Euclid and had at irregular inter- 
vals taken hold of somebody’s 
imagination. (At present, hardly 
anyone pays any attention to it.) 

Let’s first see what the term 
means (Fig. 2). 

We have here a distance AB 
which is to be divided according 
to the golden section. To do so, 
we erect a vertical line in B 
which is precisely half as long as 
AB. The rest of the construction 
can be read off the diagram. The 
result is that the distance called 
the minor has the same propor- 
tion to the major as the major 
has to the total, namely AB. And 
if we now subtract the minor 
from the major, we have divided 
the major according to the golden 
section. 

' I ^HE golden section was pub- 
licized for the first time by an 
Italian, Luca Pacioli, who may be 
the inventor of double-entry book- 
keeping; at any rate, this method 
appears in print for the first time 
in one of his books. After having 
produced this boon for tax collec- 
tors and merchants, he intended 
to bestow a similar boon to artists 
with a book called De Divina 
Proportione, published in 1509 

59 



with illustrations by his friend 
Leonardo da Vinci. 

Pacioli tried to show — and 
succeeded to a good extent — that 
most of the things we consider 
“beautiful” are constructed in ac- 
cordance with the golden section 
when broken down into measure- 
ments. The numerical relationship 
of the golden section is 5 to 8 and, 
for centuries, all books did cor- 
respond to it. European books 
still do, at least more often than 
American books. The only book 
in my library which is of Ameri- 
can origin and which shows that 
proportion is the World Almanac. 

The next time the golden sec- 
tion was consciously “rediscov- 
ered” by the artists, or more pre- 
cisely by the theorists of art, was 
around the middle of the nine- 
teenth century, just the time in 
which John Taylor wrote. It can- 
not be said that his book was a 
success and it probably would 
have been forgotten completely if 
it had not been for Charles Piazzi 
Smyth, at that time Astronomer 
Royal for Scotland. 

Smyth was the son of an admi- 
ral and he happened to be bom 
in Italy. His godfather at the 
christening was Father Giuseppe 
Piazzi, the discoverer of the aster- 
oid Ceres, the first asteroid to be 
found. Father Piazzi said then 
that he hoped that the child 
would become an astronomer. 

Charles Piazzi Smyth did be- 



come an astronomer and, as an 
astronomer, he made important 
contributions to spectroscopy, 
then a very new science. He also 
deserves much credit for advo- 
cating an innovation which now 
seems obvious to us — building 
observatories on high mountains. 

At the age of forty, Smyth 
came across John Taylor’s book 
and became enchanted with it. 
Thinking and dreaming about it, 
he quickly convinced himself that 
Taylor had barely scratched the 
surface. He thought and calcu- 
lated and worked and, in 1864, he 
wrote a 600-page book called 
Our Inheritance in the Great 
Pyramid. 

It was a great success and its 
awed readers learned that the 
main item in the plan for the 
Great Pyramid had been nothing 
less than the squaring of the cir- 
cle. Smyth said that the bottom 




Hg. 2. The "golden Mction" 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



square of the pyramid repre- 
sented — or, rather, was equal to 
— the circumference of a circle 
drawn with the height of the p 30 ‘- 
amid as its radius. 

Vj^HOEVER read this with a 
” critical or just an open eye 
should have stopped right there. 
Maybe the base of the p 50 -amid 
measured 3055.24 feet, as Prof. 
Smyth said, but how about the 
height? The outer casing and with 
it the point of the pyramid were 
missing. Therefore the height 
could not be measured directly. 
Of course if the casing had been 
there, one could have measured 
the slope angle and calculated the 
height from that. 

The slope angle must have 
been near 52°, so Smyth said 
that it originally was 51° 51' 
14.3" which produced a height of 
486.256 feet. Therefore the ratio 
of height to circumference corre- 
sponded to two pi. Insisting that 
this could not be a coincidence 
and apparently unaware of the 
fact that he himself had not found 
the figure but put it in, Smyth 
went on to other discoveries. 

At the base, one side of the 
pyramid measured 763.81 feet. 
The Egyptians naturally had not 
used feet as a unit of measure- 
ment; it must have been some- 
thing else. Smj^h divided these 
763.81 feet by 365.2422 and got a 
unit he called the “pyramid me- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



ter.” Why this figure? Obviously 
the builders of the pyramid had 
wanted to express the number of 
days in the year by the base line. 

Dividing the pyramid meter 
into 25 equal parts, Smjdh ob- 
tained the pyramid inch, which, 
by a strange coincidence, dif- 
fered from the English inch 
by just 1/ 1000th of an inch. Ob- 
viously the English still used the 
pyramid inch, but had not kept 
its length accurately through the 
millennia. It had shrunk by 1/lOth 
of one per cent. 

Having the “pyramid meter” 
and the “pyramid inch,” Smyth 
really got going. 

Multiply the pyramid inch by 
10^ and you have the length of 
the polar axis of the Earth. 

Multiply the pyramid inch by 
the height of the pyramid (in 
pyramid inches, of course) and 
then multiply that figure by 10° 
and you get the distance from the 
Earth to the Sun. (The result is 
91.84 million miles, which is nei- 
ther perihelion nor aphelion nor 
mean distance.) 

Express the cubic content of 
the pyramid in cubic inches and 
you have the total number of all 
people that have lived on Earth 
since the Creation. 

A S FOR the so-called sarco- 
phagus, it was not only the 
original standard for volumetric 
measurements, according to 

61 



Smyth. It was more. Its volume, 
expressed in cubic pyramid me- 
ters, was precisely 5.7, which 
looks like a wrong figure until you 
realize that this is the specific 
gravity of the Earth as a whole! 
(Actually the density of the 
Earth is 5.52.) 

One reader, by profession an 
engineer, wrote later that Smyth’s 
treatise cost him the better part 
of a night and that it had the re- 
sult that he “did not fall asleep 
in my bed but in a medley of end- 
less decimals, triangles and cir- 
cles, complicated by polar diame- 
ters and astronomical distances; 
dealing with empty granite sar- 
cophagi and pharaohs with mile- 
long measuring rods marching 
through space with the luminous 
eyes of prophets.” 

He realized that Smyth had 
“found” his “cosmic figures” in the 
pyramid by putting them in in 
the first place. But he also said 
that he had the faint feeling that 
something still needed to be ex- 
plained. 

It was explained several dec- 
ades later by the egyptologist Lud- 
wig Borchardt, who approached 
the whole problem from the op- 
posite direction. He asked just 
what unit the Egyptians had actu- 
ally used in building. Moreover, 
he wanted to know just how far 
advanced their mathematics had 
been. 

As for the unit of measurement. 



he found that they used the ell. 
There was a minor complication 
in that it seemed that they had 
used two different kinds of ells. 
One had a length of seven palms, 
the other of six palms. Although 
the six-palm ell corresponds bet- 
ter to reality (an ell is the length 
from the elbow to the tip of the 
longest finger), the seven-palm ell 
was used for construction, at least 
for large buildings. 

In our measurement, the “royal 
ell” of seven palms is a little less 
than 21 inches. Borchardt used 
525 millimeters as an approxima- 
tion. Then the palm would be 75 
millimeters or just about three 
inches. Each palm, in turn, was 
divided into four fingers, which 
would measure 19 millimeters 
each if the figure for the royal ell 
of 525 millimeters is accepted. At 
any event, the ell had seven 
palms or 28 “fingers.” 

As regards Egyptian arithmetic, 
we know that they could handle 
simple fractions like Vi, Vs, Vi, 
etc^ and fractions like Vi (namely 
1 minus Vi) or % (1 minus Vs). 
When it comes to pyramids, we 
have a few examples in the fa- 
mous Papyrus Rhind which, while 
old, is probably a good deal 
younger than the pyramid. 

■p’ XAMPLE No. 56 in the Pa- 
pyrus Rhind requested the 
pupil to calculate the slope of a 
pyramid with a base length of

circle with the aid of the Great Pyramid 



360 ells and a height of 250 ells. 
A modem high school boy would 
reach for the logarithm table and 
come up (unless he made a mis- 
take) with the answer 54° 14' 
46". The Egyptian advanced pu- 
pil answered 5 1/25 palms. 

Example No. 58 said that the 
base length was 140 ells and the 
height 9314 ells. The answer was 
5*4 palms. 

And example No. 59 (no doubt 
dealing with a backyard p 5 o-a- 
mid) gave 12 ells as the length 
of the base line and 8 ells as the 
height. The answer was also 5V4 
palms.

What do these answers mean? 

The answer is given in Fig. 5. 
The answer meant that the slope 
of the pyramid was so many 
palms from a vertical line one ell 
in height. That this is correct is 
proved by the fact that measuring 
triangles for the use of builders 
and masons have been found 
which corresponded to slopes of 
5, 5 Vi, etc., palms, all rather awk- 
ward angles if expressed in de- 
grees and minutes of arc. 

The slope of the Great Pyra- 
mid was quite close to 52°. For 
lack of the casing, one could not 
be any more precise than that. A 
slope of SVz palms produces an 



angle of 51° 50.6'. And that 
would have made the pyramid 
280 ells high, a neat, even figure 
— in Egyptian measurements, 
that is. 

Now remember that John Tay- 
lor had proclaimed that the pyra- 
mid represented the golden sec- 
tion. Prof. Sm3rth had proclaimed 
that it represented pi. Since it 
cannot possibly do both, Bor- 
chardt calculated what the re- 
spective angles would have to be 
and how the measurements would 
have come out in Egyptian ells. 
The result surprised everybody. 
You find it clearly demonstrated 
in this table:

S MALL wonder that people 
were led astray if the pi 
slope, the golden section slope 
and the simple Egyptian slope 
were practically the same. They 
are so much alike that it is im- 
possible to distinguish them on 
a drawing of anything like pub- 
lishable size. 

That they did not “intend” to 
build a pi slope is also clear from 



the Papyrus Rhind, where the 
ratio we now call pi appears in 
examples No. 41, 48 and 50 in 
the form that 8/9th of the diame- 
ter of a circle is the side of a 
square of equal area. In our nota- 
tion, this makes pi equal to 
3.1604, which is too large. If they 
had tried for the pi slope, it would 
have been a different pyramid, 
considering their idea of the value 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of pi. There is no way of saying 
whether they knew the golden 
section, but it is not even remote- 
ly likely. 

We are left then with the reali- 
zation that Khufu’s builders were 
extremely skilled workers, but 
that they did not try to hide any 
cosmic secrets. And where did 
they acquire their skill? Well, 
while the Great Pyramid is the 
biggest and one of the oldest pyr- 
amids, there had been consider- 
able practice in building before. 
The pyramid had forerunners, 
called mastabas (Fig. 6). 

No. 1 shows a cross section of 
the mastaba of King Mena of the 
First Dynasty. It is just a subter- 
ranean burial chamber covered 
by a solid slab of mud brick. No. 
2 is the mastaba of King Djer of 
the First Dynasty and No. 3 the 




Egyptian method of measuring angles 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



mastaba of King Den, also of the 
First D 3 masty. You can see how 
the pyramid shape was gradually 
approached. No. 4 is the tomb of 
King Zoser of the Third Dynasty; 
I called it “tomb” for, as can be 
seen, it is hard to decide whether 
this was still a rather complicated 
mastaba or a pyramid without 
casing. 

The first pyramid which did 
have a casing, filling in the steps, 
was that of King Snefru of the 
Fourth Djmasty, the same dy- 
nasty to which King Khufu be- 
longed. 

I said earlier that Herodotus 
was probably told a tall tale when 
he was informed that the whole 
nation was drafted by Khufu to 
build his pyramid. It was an un- 
likely story in the first place, for 
one can assume that a pharaoh 
knew better than to ruin all com- 
merce for years. 

But then who did provide the 
muscle power? No doubt that 
slaves did work on the pyramid; 
this is only logical for a slave- 
holding society. But slaves in gen- 
eral also had other vital things to 
do. 

The most likely answer is that 
the local fellahin, the peasants, 
were employed once a year. 

When the Nile flooded the 
country, the circumstances were 
proper for floating in the building 
blocks. And it was also the time 
when the fellahin had to sit idle, 

65 




Fig. 6. Forerunner of the pyramids, the mastabos 



precisely because their fields were 
flooded, making it logical to em- 
ploy them for this period. Maybe 
the word “employ” is not quite 
right. They were probably 
drafted. But we now know that 
they were paid, mostly in food 
and clothing. 

It is still probable that the 



overseers carried whips. But they 
also carried, in the last stages of 
the building, the triangles made 
for a slope of SVz palms per ell 
of vertical height, the proportion 
which was destined to cause so 
much confusion thousands of 
years later.

was not always this hot, or the 
glacier waters so fast, the seas so 
high. 

They adapted — they grew 
tanner and moved farther pole- 
ward. 

When the steam finally rose 
over equatorial waters, they 
moved to the last planet, Pluto, 
and their descendants lived and 
died and came to know the same 
heat and red skies. Finally there 
came the day when they couldn’t 
adapt — not, at least, in the usual 
way. 

But they had the knowledge of 
all the great civilizations on 
Earth, so they built the last 
spaceship. 

They built it very slowly and 
carefully. Their will to live be- 
came the will to leave this final, 
perfect monument. It took a hun- 
dred and fifty years and during 
all that time they planned every 
facet of its operation, every detail 
of its complex mechanisms. Be- 
cause the ship had a big job to do, 
they named it Destiny and peo- 
ple began to think of it not as the 
last of the spaceships, but as the 
first. 

The dying race sowed the ship 
with human seed and hopefully 
named its unborn passengers 
Adam, Eve, Joseph and Mary. 
Then they launched it toward the 
middle of the Milky Way and lay 
back in the red light of their burn- 
ing planet.

A LL this was only a memory 
now, conserved in the think- 
tank of a machine that raced 
through speckled space, dodging, 
examining, classifying, charting 
what it saw. Behind, the Sim 
shrank as once it swelled, and 
the planets that were not con- 
sumed turned cold in their orbits. 
The Sun grew fainter and went 
out, and still the ship sped for- 
ward, century after century, com- 
etlike, but with a purpose. 

At many of the specks, the ship 
circled, sucking in records, pass- 
ing judgment, moving on — a bee 
in the garden of stars. Finally, 
hundreds of light-years from what 
had been its home, it located an 
Earth-type world, accepted it 
from a billion miles off, and 
swung into an approach that 
would last exactly eighteen years. 

Immediately, pumps delivered 
measured quantities of oxygen 
and nitrogen atoms. Circuits 
closed to move four tiny frozen 
eggs next to frozen spermatozoa. 
The temperature gradually in- 
creased to a heat once maintained 
by animals now extinct. 

The embryos grew healthily 
and at term were bom of plastic 
wombs. 

The first voices they heard 
were of their real mothers. Soft, 
caressing songwords. Melodious, 
warm, recorded women voices, 
each different, bell-clear, viva- 
cious, betraying nothing of the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fact that they were dead these 
long centuries. 

“I am your mother,” each voice 
told its belated offspring. “You 
can see me and hear me and 
touch what appears to be me, and 
together with your cousins, you’ll 
grow strong and healthy. .” 

The voices sang on and the 
babies gurgled in their imported 
terran atmosphere. The words 
were meaningless but important, 
for it had been learned on the 
now dead world that these sounds 
were one of the factors in love 
and learning. 

Day after day, the voices 
lapped warm over the children. 
Plastic feeders provided nutrition 
as noiseless pumps removed ex- 
cess carbon dioxide. 

In one end of the ship, a minia- 
ture farm was born hydroponi- 
cally, its automatic grinders pre- 
digesting ripe vegetables for the 
children. Animals were bom, too, 
for food, but also companionship, 
and later to stock New Earth 
ahead. 

As the babies began to under- 
stand, the woman voices merged 
into one mechanical mother who 
could be heard and seen and 
summoned on panel screens 
throughout the ship. Everything 
became as Earthlike as possible, 
but because the environment was 
artificial, the children grew aware 
of their purpose in life at an age 
rarely reached on ancient Earth. 



f I ’HEY were two years old 
when their Mecmother in- 
formed them: “You are xmlike 
any children ever bom. You are 
the last of a dead race, but you 
must live. You must not be afraid. 
You must do ever3rthing humanly 
possible to live.” 

When they were four, Mec- 
mother introduced them to Mec- 
teacher and said to pay attention 
for five hours each day. Mec- 
teacher took their IQs and ex- 
plained to Adam that he had a 
greater capacity than Eve, Joseph 
and Mary, and was therefore 
their leader. 

Soon afterward, all the chil- 
dren started “school,” but Adam 
excelled. At seven, he knew all 
about landing the ship. He played 
that he was already eighteen and 
the ship was no longer on auto- 
matic. 

He was in everything and 
everywhere. His tow hair poked 
above the control board. His busy 
fingers hand-picked an experi- 
mental meal from the farmroom. 
When he learned how to turn the 
artificial gravity switch off in the 
recroom, his child legs floated 
haphazardly somewhere above his 
head. And in the sunroom, where 
heat-lamp walls were triggered by 
the degree of an occupant’s tan, 
Adam’s freckled face stared 
through the visiport, seeing in his 
mind’s eye the New Earth he 
would one day conquer.

He lived fully, asking ques- 
tions, accepting the answers, re- 
ceiving instructions. Some of 
them he testily disobeyed, was 
punished compassionately, and 
learned respect and a kind of love 
for the mecs. 

He played the games of child- 
hood, but he played them alone. 
Once he was gazing out a port, 
imaginatively sorting the stars of 
his universe into shapes of the 
animals in the ship’s farm. Mec- 
father lit up at a nearby panel, 
glowing faintly red. Adam resisted 
an impulse to shiver — the panel 
always made him flinch when it 
glowed red. Red, he was being 
conditioned, was his conscience, 
brought out by Mecfather until 
he grew old enough to bring it 
out himself. 

“Why aren’t you playing with 
the other children?” Mecfather 
asked. “Fve been watching you 
all day and you’ve avoided them 
on every occasion.” 

Though he feared him, Adam 
loved Mecfather as he had been 
taught to do and did not hesitate 
to confide. But how could he ex- 
plain that the other children did 
not seem as real to him as the 
mecs? 

“I don’t know,” Adam answered 
truthfully. 

“They don’t ignore you. They 
ask you to play, but you always 
go off by yourself. Don’t you like 
them?” 

70 



“They’re flat. Father. They’re 
not deep — like you.” 

CiLENT hidden computers as- 
^ sembled the answer, corre- 
lated, circuited a mechanical 
smile. Certainly — a child brought 
up with only three real children 
and three talking images in his 
universe could not distinguish be- 
tween reality and appearance. On 
the screen, Adam saw Mecfather 
smile, the panel no longer red. 

The voice was quiet now and 
full of understanding. “It is I 
who am flat, Adam. I am only an 
image, a voice. I am here when 
you need me to help, but I am 
not deep. Your cousins are deep; 
I am the flat one. You will un- 
derstand better when you grow 
older.” 

Electronically, Mecfather was 
worried. He called a “conference” 
of the other mecs and their cir- 
cuits joined in a complicated ana- 
log: What was the probable 

outcome of this beginning of dis- 
harmony? There were too many 
variables for an immediate an- 
swer, but the query was stored in 
each mec’s memory banks for 
later answer. 

When the mecconference be- 
gan, the panel switched off and 
Adam walked thoughtfully 
through the ship’s corridors. Un- 
expectedly, he spotted the other 
children. He turned quickly into 
a room before they saw him and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ducked behind the largest of the 
couches. 

He was in the aft recroom, he 
realized, not having paid atten- 
tion to where he was going. What 
was it all about? Did Mecfather 
really mean it when he said the 
cousins were deeper than the 
mecs? Adam could believe he was 
different from his parents and 
teacher — after all, he was only 
seven — but he couldn’t accept 
the information that he was not 
different from his cousins. Some- 
how, he thought, I am alone. 

He heard noises, the loud bois- 
terousness of Joseph, the high- 
pitched squeal of Eve, the grating 
laugh of Mary. Adam cringed 
deeper behind the big couch. He 
was different. He didn’t make 
sounds like that. 

“Adam! Oh, A-dam! A-dam!” 
the cousins called, each their own 
way. “Come out wherever you 
are, Adam! Come out and play!” 

From behind the couch, Adam 
saw the beginnings of an infantile 
but systematic search. The three 
of them were looking behind 
things, under furniture, in back of 
hatches. They tried moving every- 
thing they saw, but couldn’t 
budge the heavy couch Adam hid 
behind. 

Looking for escape, Adam’s 
eyes caught a round metallic han- 
dle set flush into the heavy deck 
carpet. He lifted it and pulled. 
Nothing happ>ened. He stood up. 



bracing his feet against the deck 
and heaved with all his strength. 
It didn’t move. 

Then he experimentally turned 
the handle — to the right until it 
clicked faintly, then the left, 
around twice, another faint click, 
but different, a left-hand click, he 
knew somehow. So he turned 
again to the left, this time three 
turns — and then the click was 
heavy, almost audible. He pulled 
the handle and a door formed out 
of the carpet, swinging easily 
open. 

Just then, Joseph peered be- 
hind the couch. “Boo!” 

A DAM jumped into the open- 
ing, the heavy door slamming 
shut overhead. Below, he stood 
erect and was surprised to feel 
the hair on his head brush the 
ceiling. 

He was frightened, but he 
calmed when he realized there 
were many places on the ship he 
hadn’t been before. Mecteacher 
revealed them to him, but very 
slowly, and he supposed he would 
not be told about everything for 
many years. As he recovered his 
sense of balance, he became 
aware of a faint luminescence 
around him. It seemed to have no 
source, but was stronger in the 
distance. 

He began to explore, groping at 
flrst, then more smoothly, effi- 
ciently, as his eyes adjusted to 



THE DEEP ONE 



71 



the semi-darkness. A long corri- 
dor op>ened up before him and 
what appeared before to be an 
illusion of distance actually was 
distance. He guessed he was near 
the engine compartment and 
vaguely sensed that the lumines- 
cence had something to do with 
the nuclear engines that Mec- 
teacher told him moved the ship. 

It was warm in here. Not physi- 
cally warm but friendy warm, like 
when Mecmother spoke her com- 
fort. The similarity almost made 
him cry, for he understood, even 
in his seven years, that Mec- 
mother was but the image of his 
real mother who lived long ago 
and said those words of sympathy 
to a child yet unborn. He wanted 
her now, even her image, but he 
didn’t call because he’d have to 
explain why he was hiding from 
his cousins. 

He shivered then, thinking that 
Mecfather and Mecteacher knew 
where he was and would light up 
their panels red. He thought, 
“Are you down here, Mecfather?” 
Nothing answered, so he spoke 
the thought, and again the walls 
stayed dark. 

That was why it was so friendy 
warm in here, he realized. His 
mecconscience was left above! 

Deciding that the others might 
miss him, he retraced his steps, 
located the trapdoor in the ceil- 
ing, pushed it open and ascended. 
The others were sitting on the 

72 



floor, dumbfounded, as Adam 
climbed out and slammed the 
hatch shut. 

“How did you get down there?” 
Joseph asked. 

Adam remained silent. After a 
moment. Eve and Mary lost in- 
terest in the question and started 
skipping a length of rope. 

Joseph persisted. “How? I 
pulled, too!” 

Adam didn’t answer. He knew 
the bigger boy would forget about 
it if he changed the subject. “How 
is it you’re not with Mecteacher?” 

“We were. But he made us look 
for you.” 

The closest wall panel lit 
bright red. It was Mecteacher. 
“Adam! How did you open that?” 

“I turned it — a certain way,” 
he said evasively. Adam didn’t 
want his cousins to learn how. 

“But how did you know?” 

“I — I reasoned it.” 

’ I ■'HE image faded as the new 

information was assimilated. 
Mecteacher’s voice said, “Wait a 
while, Adam.” 

The computer circuited the 
other mec’s memory banks. After 
ten minutes, the “conference” was 
over and Mecteacher returned to 
the screen. He asked Adam to 
come alone to the classroom. The 
others were dismissed. 

Reluctantly, Adam did as he 
was told. In the classroom, he 
stood stiffly in front of the cen-

tral panels. All three mecs lit up, 
their color this time a tranquiliz- 
ing blue. 

“Adam, we are not real people 
in the now,” Mecmother began. 
“Do you understand that?” 

“Y-yes, I understand. You 
are — planned — Axed before.” 
“That’s right, Adam. We are 
pre-set. We have a very large 
number of choices and actions, 
but we are not infinite.” 
“Infinite?” 

“We are limited in the help we 
can give you. We were real — 
like you — a long, long time ago. 
We exist now only to help you 
and the other children. We are 
here to educate you, to love and 
console you — and one other 
thing. We are here to settle your 
conflicts, to make sure you don’t 
hurt each other.” 

“But I didn’t hurt anyone, Mec- 
mother!” 

“Not yet, Adam, but avoiding 
the others the way you do could 
be the first sign of trouble.” 

“How do you know? How can 
you talk if you aren’t real?” 
“What you hear is a combina- 
tion of recorded words that are 
electronically put together to an- 
swer an almost infinite number of 
your questions. But do not think 
of me as not real. I was merely in 
another time. Do you understand 
that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then you also are able to see 



that your ability to reason things 

— to understand what I am tell- 
ing you now, for instance, is a re- 
markable thing.” 

“You mean because I’m not 
like the others?” 

“You have a superior mind. 
You are the leader, but do not 
regard yourself as better than the 
others. You have more intelli- 
gence, yes, but do not look down 
on your cousins for that. They 
may develop other qualities bet- 
ter than yours. Stay simple, 
Adam, and you will be able to 
live among them and thereby 
make the human race live again. 
The name of this ship is Destiny. 
Do you know why?” 

“Yes — I know.” 

“Be with the other children 
then. Play with them. You’ll need 
each other to live on New Earth 

— eleven years from now.” 

TTE THOUGHT sullenly, how 
can I play with them when 
they’re flat? But he didn’t object 
out loud to Mecmother. He didn’t 
like her this way. Explanation 
was Mecteacher’s job and disci- 
pline Mecfather’s. Mecmother 
should be warm and loving. 

Mecteacher appeared and 
asked Adam to call in the other 
children so the science lesson 
could start. 

He found them tanning in the 
sunroom, their unclothed bodies 
evenly browned from invisible

light. They followed Adam with- 
out question, but seemed to take 
a long time doing it. Joseph in- 
sisted first in donning clothes, but 
he put on protective clothing first. 
Then, realizing the absurdity of 
it, he switched to his formality 
suit — the loose-fitting robe Mec- 
teacher instructed the children to 
wear to lend dignity to the class- 
work. 

During Joseph’s delay, the girls 
ambled off somewhere and re- 
turned only when Adam shouted 
after them in exasperation. Quick- 
ening his pace, Adam reached the 
classroom first and asked Mec- 
teacher, “Are the other children 
— deep?” 

“Deep? Yes, Adam, Mecfather 
explained that to yoxi. Why are 
you confused? It’s us, the mecs, 
who are fiat. The other children 
are healthy, living beings. The 
cells from which all of you were 
bom were selected after years of 
controlled breeding. Your parents 
were the finest the human race 
could produce — intelligent, 
strong, healthy, high survival quo- 
tient Is this what you mean by 
deep?” 

“Partly, but also — feeling. I 
think I feel things better.” 

The other children waddled in, 
took their seats and switched on 
robomonitors in the ritual of 
classroom procedure. They all 
looked at Mecteacher in the cen- 
tral panel 



Mecteacher motioned Adam to 
his chair-desk and began the les- 
son. He described Old Earth and 
how it circled Old Sol with the 
other worlds and the way the 
moons circled the planets — all of 
them condensed into spheres and 
all the spheres turning in har- 
mony. 

He interrupted himself when 
Mary’s robomonitor registered 
only partial comprehension. 
“What don’t you understand, 
Mary? Is it sphere?” 

“I know what a sphere is,” she 
said, remembering a previous les- 
son. “A sphere is an apple or an 
orange — ” 

It/r ECTEACHER detected a 
covert wince from Adam’s 
monitor. The teacher appeared to 
Adam on his desk panel where 
the others couldn’t see or hear. 
“Do not think this is because she 
is not — deep, Adam. She is only 
seven and not as advanced for 
her age as you are. You under- 
stand how we mecs are pre-set?” 
“Yes.” 

“In the classroom, then, if we 
don’t go fast enough for you, try 
to be patient. We can only devi- 
ate within set limits. It is not a 
new problem, Adam. On Earth, it 
impeded the educational system 
from the beginning.” 

Simultaneously with his con- 
versation with Adam, Mecteacher 
held up an apple on the central 



THE DEEP ONE 



75 



panel and re-explained the age-old 
analogy between the apple and 
the Earth, the red skin and the 
Terran crust, and further, the sup- 
position that New Earth ahead 
would be like Old Earth and the 
apple. 

Eve wanted to know whether 
New Earth would have a New 
Moon. 

“That’s an interesting question. 
Eve. But we are still too many 
millions of miles away to know 
yet. Before you are ready to leave 
the ship, you will know.” 

In the months that passed, 
Adam tried associating more with 
the other children. He played 
their games, which seemed to him 
to be played without a purpose, 
but they wouldn’t or couldn’t play 
his — with one exception. 

He showed them how to turn 
off the artificial gravity in the rec- 
room and they became obsessed 
with the same physical euphoria 
he had discovered for himself. 
But even while in free-fall, Adam 
maintained his need for reason 
and couldn’t indulge their point- 
less pastimes for long. Often, 
when he grew tired tired of free- 
falling, he visited his lonely cham- 
ber under the deck and explored 
the working parts of the ship. 

On almost each occasion when 
he returned, he was caught by 
one of the mecs and punished 
with fiercely glowing red panels. 
Remembering a previous conver- 



sation with the mecs, Adam rea- 
soned that their present dissatis- 
faction with him was not real. 
After all, he recalled, they were 
pre-set. They had to act like that 
when he disobeyed them. Going 
against them wasn’t necessarily 
the same as doing wrong. 

It took an act of will and intel- 
ligence far in advance of his 
seven years, for Adam realized 
that if he continued like this, the 
conditioning would eat at his 
brain like acid and guilt would 
rise in the etch. So, from under 
the ship’s deck, he turned the 
mecs permanently off. 

’ I ^HE stars changed with the 
passing years. The blue giant 
Adam used to watch from the 
darkside port was now a diamond 
chip lost in starmilk night. Ahead, 
a new jewel grew larger in the 
quartz port, a sapphire blazing 
hot and big — bigger than any 
star in his memory, closer than 
the Destiny had ever come to a 
star. 

Adam understood why the star 
was so big. He was eighteen Old 
Earth years of age now and the 
star was New Sol. Soon there 
would be a New Earth and may- 
be a New Moon. His destiny was 
near, his job decided. He would 
locate the planet, orbit it, search 
for a clear space and land. Then 
he and the others — 

The others. The repulsive, 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



flighty, inconsistent trio. They 
were alike, all right, with never a 
serious thought in their heads. 
Why weren’t they concerned with 
their destiny as he was? If he 
were a genius as the mecs once 
told him, why weren’t the others 
also geniuses? They all came 
from the best stock of Old Earth. 
No, it wasn’t just that he was su- 
pernormal; the others were — flat, 
undeep. 

For years^ he had kept peace 
by yielding to their demands. He 
suffered their company, suc- 
cumbed to their activities. But 
every so often, when he felt espe- 
cially disgusted, he retreated to 
his private sanctum under the 
deck. This was such a time now, 
he felt, as Eve and Mary giggled 
over to him. 

They were not nude as had 
been the custom aboard the ship 
ever since he turned off the mecs. 
They had clothes draped over 
parts of them that seemed some- 
how to make them more than 
nude. But they wore red coloring 
on their lips that he thought was 
repulsive. 

He ducked behind the couch, 
clicked open the familiar combi- 
nation and descended into the 
only peace he ever knew. He sat 
at a chair-table he had lowered 
into the compartment long ago, 
and peered pensively at the draw- 
ings before him. If Mecteacher 
were here, he thought, the orbit 



wouldn’t be so difficult to calcu- 
late. He’d explain how to do it. 

And then, he wondered, would 
Mecteacher have taught the 
others how to be deep? Or was 
depth something inside, some- 
thing that could not be altered by 
education? If this were a world 
with other people, he thought, 
would my cousins be considered 
abnormals — or would I? 

TIE PONDERED the question 
for a moment, then decided, 
as he had so often in the past, 
that it was truly the cousins who 
were the flat ones. They were de- 
viants from an average that 
couldn’t exist on the Destiny, but 
which must have once existed 
elsewhere. They had been flat at 
seven — perhaps when children 
are supposed to be flat, as Mec- 
mother had suggested — but they 
stayed that way. At eighteen, as 
at seven, they still played the 
same games with scarcely any 
variation. 

He heard them rummaging 
above, attempting again and 
again to pull open the hatch. It 
had happened this way for years: 
They’d try to open the trapdoor 
for an hour or two, then give it up 
and turn their attention to some- 
thing else. They never thought to 
turn the handle. Maybe an un- 
deep person wouldn’t be able to 
reason the combination clicks, but 
only a completely flat one would 



THE DEEP ONE 



77 



persist in pulling when it always 
ended in failure. 

Possibly, he thought, the cos- 
mic rays had been more destruc- 
tive to their egg cells. Or maybe 
the alien radiations subtracted 
something from the other cells to 
add to his. If this were true, he 
was partly a product of the others 
and owed his depth to them. 

Adam felt sorry for his cousins 
then and wished he hadn’t hurt 
them by avoiding their presence. 
Despite their undepth, they must 
have feelings. The mecs probably 
wouldn’t have been able to give 
them depth but, he remembered, 
the other role of the mecs was to 
prevent each one of them from 
harming the others. In their role 
as arbitrator, Adam realized, they 
might have stopped him from 
hurting them so. 

Filled with remorse, he left his 
desk-chair and walked stoop- 
shouldered under the low ceiling. 
At the trapdoor, he opened the 
combination on the inside lock 
handle and pushed upward. It 
wouldn’t open. He tried again, but 
it wasn’t the lock that was stuck. 
They must have slid something 
heavy over the hatch, something 
he couldn’t move. 

He tried calling to them, but 
his voice was lost in the insulative 
metal of the deck. Finally he sat 
down, conserving his strength for 
a final onslaught. 

If he couldn’t open the hatch. 



he realized vividly it would be 
not only his failure, but the fail- 
me of the human race. 

But maybe it did not have to 
be so. Maybe the differences in 
the others weren’t biological — 
maybe they were environmental. 
And with that thought, he made 
his way through the narrow pas- 
sageway and reversed his deed of 
eleven years past. He turned the 
mecs back on. 

Returning to the hatch, he re- 
worked the combination to make 
sure it was not the lock that held 
him. He pushed upward with all 
his strength, steadily with increas- 
ing pressiu-e, vmtil the beads of 
perspiration turned into gulleys 
that streamed down his face. 

Exhausted, he crawled back to 
his chair and lay across the desk 
littered with calculations of a 
landing he would never make. 
The soft luminescence from the 
Destiny's nuclear engines crept 
forward and caressed him. 

TN THE aft recroom. Eve and 
Mary were admiring Joseph’s 
strength in being able to push the 
heavy couch over Adam’s trap- 
door. 

Three wall panels lit red. All 
the mecs appeared together. “It’s 
time for your science lesson,” one 
said. “But where is Adam?” 

“He’s in the trapdoor,” they an- 
swered flatly. 

The panel txumed green, reserv- 



78

ing its redness for the delinquent 
Adam when he would choose to 
appear. 

Mecteacher began, “Now about 
the Solar System . 

But the cousins didn’t listen. 
Joseph had turned the gravity 
switch off and they were too busy 
floating upended, trying new posi- 
tions, laughing at each other’s ri- 
diculous postures in the ship with- 
out bottom. The game was not a 
new one, but it was newly discov- 
ered and they reveled in its 
glories. 

Month after month, they played 
their weightless games while the 
mecs implored them to come 
down. The constellations shifted 
in the visiports. New Sol grew 
larger and then smaller as the 
Destiny sped toward its unseen 
planet. 

In the recroom, the mecvoices 
were only noises to the trio now, 
annoying noises that could be si- 
lenced, they discovered, with 
forceful kicks to the red-glowing 
panels. 

When all the mecscreens had 
been smashed and the weightless 
games grew boring, Mary looked 
out the sunroom port. She was 



surprised to see a rust-yellow 
sphere hanging in the sky. She 
watched it seriously for a time, 
frowning as it grew bigger and 
filled a third of her horizon. Then 
she called Eve and Joseph. 

Mary pointed and they all 
stared in bewilderment. She 
opened her eyes wide and laughed 
with glee. “It’s an apple,” she 
said. “An apple in the sky!” 

But Joseph wasn’t fooled. 
Dimly he remembered something 
Adam had told him — something 
about a thing that would appear 
in the sky. He fought hard bring- 
ing it to conscious memory. Then 
he started aft toward the rec- 
room. In there, under the couch, 
he remembered, was Adam. Adam 
would remind him what it was. 

Suddenly Joseph smiled, his 
face flushed. He turned back to 
the sunroom port. He wouldn’t 
have to ask Adam, after all. For a 
moment, he watched to make 
sure, while the huge yellow sphere 
swam closer. 

“No, Mary,” he said trium- 
phantly. “It’s not an apple in the 
sky. Apples are red. It’s an or- 
ange!”

A rthur lanceford 

slapped futilely at the 
sith buzzing hungrily 
around his head. The outsized 
eight-legged parody of a mosquito 
did a neat half roll and zoomed 
out of range, hanging motionless 
on vibrating wings a few feet 
away. 

A raindrop staggered it mo- 
mentarily, and for a fleeting sec- 
ond, Lanceford had the insane 
hope that the arthropod would 
fall out of control into the mud. 
If it did, that would be the end 



of it, for Niobian mud was as 
sticky as flypaper. But the sith 
righted itself inches short of disas- 
ter, buzzed angrily and retreated 
to the shelter of a nearby broad- 
leaf, where it executed another 
half roll and hung upside down, 
watching its intended meal with 
avid anticipation. 

Lanceford eyed the insect dis- 
tastefully as he explored his 
jacket for repellent and applied 
the smelly stuff liberally to his 
face and neck. It wouldn’t do 
much good. In an hour, his sweat

would remove whatever the rain 
missed — but for that time, it 
should discourage the sith. As far 
as permanent discouraging went, 
the repellent was useless. Once 
one of those eight-legged horrors 
checked you off, there were only 
two possible endings to the af- 
fair — either you were bitten or 
you killed the critter. 

It was as simple as that. 

He had hop>ed that he would be 
fast enough to get the sith before 
it got him. He had been bitten 
once already and the memory of 
those paralyzed three minutes 
while the bloodsucker fed was 
enough to last him for a lifetime. 
He readjusted his helmet, tucking 
its fringe of netting beneath his 
collar. The netting, he reflected 
gloomily, was like its owner — 
much the worse for wear. How- 
ever, this trek would be over in 
another week and he would be 
able to spend the next six months 
at a comfortable desk job at the 
Base, while some other poor devil 
did the chores of field work. 

TTE LOOKED down the rain- 
swept trail winding through 
the jungle. Niobe — a perfect 
name for this wet little world. The 
Bureau of Extraterrestrial Explo- 
ration couldn’t have picked a bet- 
ter, but the funny thing about it 
was that they hadn’t picked it in 
the first place. Niobe was the na- 
tive word for Earth, or perhaps 



“the world” would be a more ac- 
curate definition. It was a coinci- 
dence, of course, but the planet 
and its mythological Greek name- 
sake had much in common. 

Niobe, like Niobe, was all tears 
— a world of rain falling endlessly 
from an impenetrable overcast, 
fat wet drops that formed a griev- 
ing background sound that never 
ceased, sobbing with soft mourn- 
ful noises on the rubbery broad- 
leaves, crying with obese splashes 
into forest pools, blubbering with 
loud, dismal persistence on the 
sounding board of his helmet. And 
on the ground, the raindrops 
mixed with the loesslike soil of 
the trail to form a gluey mud that 
clung in huge pasty balls to his 
boots. 

Everywhere there was water, 
running in rivulets of tear-streaks 
down the round cheeks of the 
gently sloping land — rivulets that 
merged and blended into broad 
shallow rivers that wound their 
mourners’ courses to the sea. Trek- 
king on Niobe was an amphib- 
ious operation unless one stayed 
in the highlands — a perpetual se- 
ries of fords and river crossings. 

And it was hot, a seasonless,

ing insects. Many of these were 
no worse than those of Earth, but 
a half dozen sp>ecies were deadly. 
The first bite sensitized. The sec- 
ond killed — anaphylactic shock, 
the medics called it. And the sith 
was one of the deadly species. 

Lanceford shrugged fatalisti- 
cally. Uncomfortable as a protec- 
tion suit was, it was better to boil 
in it than die without it. 

He looked at Kron squatting 
beside the trail and envied him. 
It was too bad that Earthmen 
weren’t as naturally repellent to 
insects as the dominant native 
life. Like all Niobians, the native 
guide wore no clothing — ideal 
garb for a climate like this. His 
white, hairless hide, with its faint 
sheen of oil, was beautifully water- 
repellent. 

Kron, Lanceford reflected, was 
a good example of the manner in 
which Nature adapts the human- 
oid form for survival on different 
worlds. Like the dominant species 
on every intelligent planet in the 
explored galaxy, he was an erect, 
bipedal, mammalian being with 
hands that possessed an oppos- 
able thumb. Insofar as that gen- 
eral description went, Kron re- 
sembled humanity — but there 
were differences. 

CQUATTING, the peculiar 
shape of Kron’s torso and the 
odd flexibility of his limbs were 
not apparent. One had the ten- 



dency to overlook the narrow- 
shouldered, cylindrical body and 
the elongated tarsal and carpal 
bones that gave his limbs four 
major articulations rather than 
the human three, and to concen- 
trate upon the utterly alien head. 

It jutted forward from his short, 
thick neck, a long-snouted, vague- 
ly doglike head with tiny ears 
lying close against the hairless, 
dome-shaped cranium. Slitlike 
nostrils, equiped with sphincter 
muscles like those of a terrestrial 
seal, argued an originally aquatic 
environment, and the large intel- 
ligent eyes set forward in the 
skull to give binocular vision, to- 
gether with the sharp white car- 
nassal teeth and pointed canines, 
indicated a carnivorous ancestry. 
But the modern Niobians, al- 
though excellent swimmers, were 
land dwellers and ate anything. 

Lanceford couldn’t repress an 
involuntary shudder at some of 
the things they apparently en- 
joyed. Tastes differed — enor- 
mously so between Earthmen and 
Niobians. 

There was no doubt that the 
native was intelligent, yet he, like 
the rest of his race, was a techno- 
logical moron. It was strange that 
a race which had a well-devel- 
oped philosophy and an amazing 
comprehension of semantics could 
be so backward in mechanics. 
Even the simpler of the BEE’s 
mechanisms left the natives con- 



SURVIVAl TYPE

fused. It was possible that they 
could leam about machinery, but 
Lanceford was certain that it 
would take a good many years be- 
fore the first native mechanic 
would set up a machine shop on 
this planet. 

Lanceford finished tucking the 
last fold of face net under his 
collar, and as he did so, Kron 
stood up, rising to his five-foot 
height with a ciirious flexible 
grace. Standing, he looked some- 
thing like a double-jointed alabas- 
ter Anubis — wearing swim fins. 
His broad, webbed feet rested eas- 
ily on the surface of the mud, 
their large area giving him flota- 
tion that Lanceford envied. As a 
result, his head was nearly level 
with that of the human, although 
there was better than a foot dif- 
ference in their heights. 

Lanceford looked at Kron in- 
quiringly. “You have a place in 
mind where we can sleep to- 
night?” 

“Sure, Boss. We’ll be coming to 
hunthouse soon. We go now?” 

“Lead on,” Lanceford said, 
groaning silently to himself — an- 
other hunthouse with its darkness 
and its smells. He shrugged. He 
could hardly expect anything else 
up here in the highlands. Oh, well, 
he’d managed to last through the 
others and this one could be no 
worse. At that, even an airless 
room full of natives was prefer- 
able to spending a night outside. 



And the sith wouldn’t follow 
them. It didn’t like airless rooms 
filled with natives. 

He sighed wearily as he fol- 
lowed Kron along the dim path 
through the broadleaf jungle. 
Night was coming, and with dark- 
ness, someone upstairs turned on 
every faucet and the sheets of 
rain that fell during the day 
changed abruptly into a deluge. 
Even the semi-aquatic natives 
didn’t like to get caught away 
from shelter during the night. 

The three moved onward, im- 
mersed in a drumming wilderness 
of rain — the Niobian sliding eas- 
ily over the surface of the mud, 
the Earthman plowing painfully 
through it, and the sith flitting 
from the shelter of one broadleaf 
to the next, waiting for a chance 
to feed. 

^ I ■’HE trail widened abruptly, 
opening upon one of the small 
clearings that dotted the rain-for- 
est jungle. In the center of the 
clearing, dimly visible through the 
rain and thickening darkness, 
loomed the squat thatch-roofed 
bulk of a hunthouse, a place of 
shelter for the members of the 
hunters’ guild who provided fresh 
meat for the Niobian villages. 
Lanceford sighed a mingled 
breath of relief and unpleasant 
anticipation. 

As he stepped out into the 
clearing, the sith darted from 



84

cover, heading like a winged bul- 
let for Lanceford’s neck. But the 
man was not taken by surprise. 
Pivoting quickly, he caught the 
iridescent blur of the bloodsuck- 
er’s wings. He swung his arm in 
a mighty slap. The high-pitched 
buzz and Lanceford’s gloved hand 
met simultaneously at his right 
ear. The buzz stopped abruptly. 
Lanceford shook his head and the 
sith fell to the ground, satisfactor- 
ily swatted. Lanceford grinned — 
score one for the human race. 

He was still grinning as he 
pushed aside the fiber screen clos- 
ing the low doorway of the hunt- 
house and crawled inside. It took 
a moment for his eyes to become 
accustomed to the gloom within, 
but his nose told him even before 
his eyes that the house was occu- 
pied. The natives, he thought 
wryly, must be born with no sense 
of smell, otherwise they’d perish 
from sheer propinquity. One could 
never honestly say that familiar- 
ity with the odor of a Niobian 
bred contemprt — nausea was the 
right word. 

The interior was typical, a dark 
rectangle of windowless limestone 
walls enclosing a packed-dirt floor 
and lined with a single deck of 
wooden sleeping platforms. 
Steeply angled rafters of peeled 
logs intersected at a knife-sharp 
ridge pierced with a circular 
smokehole above the firepit in the 
center of the room. Transverse 



rows of smaller poles lashed to 
the rafters supported the thick 
broadleaf thatch that furnished 
protection from the rain and sanc- 
tuary for xmcounted thousands of 
insects. 

A fire flickered ruddily in the 
pit, hissing as occasional drops of 
rain fell into its heart from the 
smokehole, giving forth a dim 
light together with clouds of 
smoke and steam that rose up- 
ward through the tangled mass of 
greasy cobwebs filling the upper 
reaches of the rafters. Some of the 
smoke found its way through the 
smokehole, but most of it hung in 
an acrid undulating layer some 
six feet above the floor. 

The glow outlined the squat- 
ting figures of a dozen or so na- 
tives clustered around the pit, 
watching the slowly rotating car- 
cass of a small deerlike rodent 
called a sorat, which was broiling 
on a spit above the flames. Kron 
was already in the ring, talking 
earnestly to one of the hunters — 
a fellow-tribesman, judging from 
the tattoo on his chest. 

To a Niobian, the scene was or- 
dinary, but to Lanceford it could 
have been lifted bodily from the 
inferno. He had seen it before, but 
the effect lost nothing by repeti- 
tion. There was a distinctly hell- 
ish quality to it — to the reds and 
blacks of the flickering fire and 
the shadows. He wouldn’t have 
been particularly surprised if Sa-

tan himself appeared in the cen- 
ter of the firepit complete with 
horns, hoofs and tail. A hunt- 
house, despite its innocuousness, 
looked like the southeast comer 
of Hades. 

^LUSTERED around the fire, 
^ the hunters turned to look at 
him curiously and, after a single 
eye-filling stare, turned back 
again. Niobians were almost pain- 
fully polite. Although Barthmen 
were still enough of a curiosity to 
draw attention, one searching look 
was all their customs allowed. 
Thereafter, they minded their 
own business. In some ways, 
Lanceford reflected, native cus- 
toms had undeniable merit. 

Presently Kron rose from his 
place beside the fire and pointed 
out two empty sleeping platforms 
where they would spend the night. 
Lanceford chose one and sank 
wearily to its resilient surface. De- 
spite its crude constmction, a 
Niobian sleeping platform was 
comfortable. He removed his 
pack, pulled off his mud-en- 
crusted boots and lay back with 
a grunt of relaxation. After a day 
like this, it was good to get off his 
feet. Weariness flowed over him. 

He awoke to the gentle pres- 
sure of Kron’s hand squeezing his 
own. “The food is cooked,” the 
Niobian said, “and you are wel- 
comed to share it.” 

Lanceford nodded, his stomach 

S6 



crawling with impleasant antici- 
pation. A native meal was some- 
thing he would prefer to avoid. 
His digestive system could handle 
the unsavory mess, but his taste 
buds shrank from the forthcoming 
assault. What the natives classed 
as a delicate and elusive flavor 
was sheer tortiire to an Earthman. 

Possibly there was some con- 
nection between their inefficient 
olfactory apparatus and their odd 
ideas of flavor, but whatever the 
physical explanation might be, it 
didn’t affect the fact that eating 
native food was an ordeal. Yet he 
couldn’t refuse. That would be 
discourteous and offensive, and 
one simply difln’t offend the na- 
tives. The BEE was explicit about 
that. Courtesy was a watchword 
on Niobe. 

He took a place by the fire, 
watching with concealed distaste 
as one of the hunters reached into 
the boiling vat beside the firepit 
with a pair of wooden tongs and 
drew forth the native conception 
of a hors d’oeuvre. They called it 
vorkum — a boiled sorat paunch 
stuffed with a number of odorous 
ingredients. It looked almost as 
bad as it smelled. 

The hunter laid the paunch on 
a wooden trencher, scraped the 
greenish scum from its surface 
and sliced it open. The odor 
poured out, a gagging essence of 
decaying vegetables, rotten eggs 
and overripe cheese. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Lanceford’s eyes watered, his 
stomach tautened convulsively, 
but the Niobians eyed the reeking 
semi-solid eagerly. No meal on 
Niobe was considered worthy of 
the name unless a generous help- 
ing of vorkum started it off. 

A N ENTREE like that could 
ruin the most rugged human 
appetite, but when it was the 
forerunner of a main dish of 
highly spiced barbecue, vorkum 
assumed the general properties of 
an emetic. Lanceford grimly con- 
trolled the nausea and tactfully 
declined the greasy handful which 
Kron offered. The Niobian never 
seemed to learn. At every meal 
they had eaten during their past 
month of travel on Niobe, Kron 
had persistently offered him sam- 
ples of the mess. With equal per- 
sistence, he had refused. After all, 
there were limits. 

But polite convention required 
that he eat something, so he took 
a small portion of the barbecued 
meat and dutifully finished it. The 
hunters eyed him curiously, ap- 
parently wondering how an entity 
who could assimilate relatively 
imtasty sorat should refuse the 
far greater delicacy of vorkum. 
But it was a known fact that the 
ways of Earthmen were strange 
and unaccountable. 

The hunters didn’t protest when 
he retired to his sleeping platform 
and the more acceptable concen- 



trates from his pack. His hunger 
satisfied, he lay back on the resili- 
ent vines and fell into a sleep of 
exhaustion. It had been a hard 
day. 

Lanceford’s dreams were un- 
pleasant. Nightmare was the usual 
penalty of sitting in on a Niobian 
meal and this one was worse than 
usual. Huge siths, reeking of vor- 
kvun, pursued him as he ran 
naked and defenseless across a 
swampy landscape that stretched 
interminably ahead. The clinging 
mud reduced his speed to a pain- 
ful crawl as he frantically beat 
off the attacks of the blood- 
suckers. 

The climax was horror. One of 
the siths slipped through his fran- 
tically beating hands and bit him 
on the face. The shocking pain of 
the bite wakened him, a cry of 
terror and anguish still on his lips. 

He looked around wildly. He 
was still in the hunthouse. It was 
just a dream. 

He chuckled shakily. These 
nightmares sometimes were too 
real for comfort. He was drenched 
with sweat, which was not un- 
usual, but there was a dull ache 
in his head and the hot tense pain 
that encompassed the right side of 
his face had not been there when 
he had fallen asleep. 

He touched his face with a ten- 
tative finger, exploring the hot 
puffiness and the enormously 
swollen ear with a gentle touch. It

was where he had struck the sith, 
but surely he couldn’t have hit 
that hard. 

He gasped, a soft breath of dis- 
may, as realization dawned. He 
had smashed the sith hard enough 
to squeeze some of the insect’s 
corrosive body juices through his 
face net — and they had touched 
his skin! That wouldn’t normally 
have been bad, but the sith bite 
he had suffered a week ago had 
sensitized him. He was developing 
an anaphylactic reaction — a se- 
vere one, judging from the swell- 
ing. 

That was the trouble with ex- 



ploration; one occasionally forgot 
that a world was alien. Occasion- 
ally danger tended to recede into 
a backgroimd of familiarity — he 
had smashed the sith before it 
had bitten him, so therefore it 
couldn’t hurt him. He grimaced 
painfully, the movement bringing 
another twinge to his swollen face. 
He should have known better. 

He swore mildly as he opened 
his Aid Kit and extracted a ster- 
ile hypo. The super-antihistamine 
developed by the Bureau was an 
unpredictable sort of thing. Some- 
times it worked and sometimes it 
didn’t. He removed the screw cap

that sealed the needle and in- 
jected the contents of the syringe 
into his arm. He hop>ed that this 
was one of the times the drug 
worked. If it wasn’t, he reflected 
grimly, he wouldn’t be long for 
this world. 

He sighed and lay back. There 
wasn’t anything more to do now. 
All he could do was wait and see 
if the anti-allergin worked. 

^ I ■' HE Bureau of Extraterrestrial 
Exploration had discovered 
Niobe barely three years ago, yet 
already the planet was famous 
not only for its peculiar climate, 




but also for the number of men 
who had died upon its watery sur- 
face. Knowledge of this planet 
was bought with life, grim pay- 
ment to decrease the lag between 
discovery and the day men could 
live and work on Niobe without 
having to hide beneath domes or 
behind protection suits. Lanceford 
never questioned the necessity or 
the inevitable price that must be 
paid. Like every other BEE agent, 
he knew that Niobe was crash 
priority — a world that had to be 
understood in minimum time. 

For Niobe was a made to order 
herbarium for a swampland plant 
called viscaya. The plant was 
originally native to Algon IV, but 
had been spread to practically 
every suitable growth center in 
the Galaxy. It was the source of 
a complex of alkaloids known as 
gerontin, and gerontin had the 
property of tripling or quadru- 
pling the normal life span of 
mammals. 

It was obvious that viscayacul- 
ture should have a tremendous 
distribution throughout the Con- 
federation worlds. But unfortu- 
nately the right conditions existed 
in very few places in the explored 
galaxy. Despite the fact that most 
life is based on carbon, oxygen 
and water, there is still very little 
free water in the Galaxy. Most 
planets of the Confederation are 
semi-arid, with the outstanding 
exceptions of Terra and Lyrane. 



SURVIVAL TYPE 



>9 



But these two worlds were the 
seats of human and humanoid 
power for so long that all of their 
swampland had been drained and 
reclaimed centuries ago. 

And it was doubly imfortunate 
that gerontin so far defied s}m- 
thesis. According to some eminent 
chemists, the alkaloid would prob- 
ably continue to do so until some 
facet of the Confederation reached 
a Class VIII culture level. Con- 
sidering that Terra and Lyrane, 
the two highest cultures, were 
only Class VII, and that Class 
level steps took several thousands 
of years to make, a ix>licy of wait- 
ing for synthesis was not worth 
considering. 

The result was that nobody 
was happy vmtil Niobe was dis- 
covered. The price of illicit geron- 
tin was astronomical and most of 
the Confederation’s supply of the 
drug was strictly rationed to those 
whom the government thought 
most valuable to the Confedera- 
tion as a whole. Of course, the 
Confederation officialdom was in- 
cluded, which caused considerable 
grximbling. In the nick of time, 
Niobe appeared upon the scene, 
and Niobe had environment in 
abundance! 

The wheels of the Confedera- 
tion began to turn. The BEE was 
given a blank check and spurred 
on by a government which, in 
turn, was being spurred on by the 
people who composed it. The ex- 



ploration of Niobe proceeded at 
all possible speed. With so many 
considerations weighed against 
them, what did a few lives mat- 
ter? For the sake of the billions 
of humanoids in the Confedera- 
tion, their sacrifice was worth- 
while even if only a few days or 
hours were saved between discov- 
ery and exploitation. 

T ANCEFORD groaned as a 
violent pain shot through his 
head. The anti-allergin apparently 
wasn’t going to work, for it should 
have had some effect by now. He 
shrugged mentally — it was the 
chance one took in this business. 
But he couldn’t say that he hadn’t 
been warned. Even old Sims had 
told him, called him a imit in the 
bee’s shortcut trial and error 
scheme — an error, it looked like 
now. 

Seemed rather silly — a Class 
VII civilization using techniques 
that were old during the Dark 
Ages before the Atomic Revolu- 
tion, sending foot parties to ex- 
plore a world in the chance that 
they might discover something 
that the search mechs missed — 
anything that would shorten the 
lag time. It was incomprehensible, 
but neither Sims nor the BEE 
would do a thing like this without 
reason. And whatever it was, he 
wasn’t going to worry about it. In 
fact, there wasn’t much time left 
to worry. The reaction was ob-

servably and painfully worse. 

It was important that the news 
of his death and the specimens he 
had collected get back to Base 
Alpha. They might have value in 
this complex game Alvord Sims 
was pla 3 nng with men, machines 
and Niobe. But Base Alpha was a 
good hundred miles away and, in 
his present condition, he couldn’t 
walk a hundred feet. 

For a moment, he considered 
setting up the powerful little 
transmitter he carried in his pack, 
but his first abortive motion con- 
vinced him it was useless. The 
blinding agony that swept through 
him at the slightest movement 
left no doubt that he would never 
finish the business of setting up 
the antenna, let alone send a 
message. 

It was a crime that handie- 
talkies couldn’t be used here on 
Niobe, but their range, limited at 
best, was practically nonexistent 
on a planet that literally seemed 
to be one entire “dead spot.” A 
fixed-frequency job broadcasting 
on a directional beam was about 
the only thing that could cover 
distance, and that required a little 
technical know-how to set up the 
antenna and focus it on Base 
Alpha. There would be no help 
from Kron. Despite his intelli- 
gence, the native could no more 
assemble a directional antenna 
than spread pink wings and fly. 

There was only one thing to do 



— get a note off to Sims, if he 
could still write, and ask Kron to 
deliver the note and his pack to 
the Base. 

He fumbled with his jacket, 
and with some pain produced a 
stylus and a pad. But it was diffi- 
cult to write. Painful, too. Better 
get Kron over here while he could 
still talk and tell him what he 
wanted. 

The stylus slipped from numb 
fingers as Lanceford called 
hoarsely, “Kron! Come here! I 
need you!” 

1^ RON looked down compas- 
sionately at the swollen fea- 
tures of the E^rthman. He had 
seen the kef effect before, among 
the young of his people who were 
incautious or inexperienced, but 
he had never seen it among the 
aliens. Surprisingly, the effects 
were the same — the livid swell- 
ings, the gasping breath, the pain. 
Strange how these foreigners re- 
acted like his own people. 

He scratched his head and 
pulled thoughtfully at one of bis 
short ears. It was his duty to help 
Lanceford, but how could he? 
The Earthman had denied his 
help for weeks, and Niobians sim- 
ply didn’t disregard another’s 
wishes. Kron scowled, the action 
lending a ferocious cast to his 
doglike face. Tolerance was a cus- 
tom hallowed by ages of practice. 
It went to extremes — even with 



SURVIVAL TYPE 



91 



life at stake, a person’s wishes and 
beliefs must be respected. 

Kron buried his long-snouted 
head in his hands, a gesture that 
held in it all the frustration which 
filled him. 

The human was apparently re- 
solved to die. He had told Kron 
his last wishes, which didn’t in- 
clude a request for help, but 
merely to get his pack back to 
the others in their glass dome. It 
was astonishing that such an ob- 
viously intelligent species should 
have so little flexibility. They 
didn’t understand the first prin- 
ciples of adaptation. Always and 
forever, they held to their own 
ways, trying with insensate stub- 
bornness to mold nature to their 
will — and when nature overcome 
their artificial defenses, they died, 
stubborn, unregenerate, inflexible 
to the end. They were odd, these 
humans — odd and a little fright- 
ening. 

Lanceford breathed wheezily. 
The swelling had invaded the in- 
ner tissues of his throat and was 
beginning to compress his wind- 
pipe. It was uncomfortable, like 
inhaling liquid fire, and then there 
was the constant desire to cough 
and the physical inability to do 
so. 

“Dirty luck,” he whispered. 
“Only a week more and I’d have 
had it made — the longest trek a 
man’s made on this benighted 
planet.” 



Kron nodded, but then belat- 
edly realized that the human was 
muttering to himself. He listened. 
There might be something impor- 
tant in these dying murmurings, 
something that might explain 
their reasons for being here and 
their strange driving haste that 
cared nothing for life. 

“It’s hard to die so far from 
one’s people, but I guess that can’t 
be helped. Old Sims gave me the 
score. Like he said, a man doesn’t 
have much choice of where he 
dies in the BEE.” 

“You don’t want to die!” Kron 
exploded. 

“Of course not,” Lanceford said 
with weak surprise. He hadn’t 
dreamed that Kron was nearby. 
This might well destroy the Im- 
perturbable Earthman myth that 
the BEE had fostered. 

“Not even if it is in accord with 
your customs and rituals?” 

“What customs?” 

“Your clothing, your eating 
habits, your ointments — are these 
not part of your living plan?” 
Despite the pain that tore at 
his throat, Lanceford managed a 
chuckle. This was ridiculous. 
“Hell, no! Our only design for liv- 
ing is to stay alive, particularly on 
jobs like this one. We don’t wear 
these suits and repellent because 
we like to. We do it to stay alive. 
If we could, we’d go around 
nearly as naked as you do.” 

“Do you mind if I help you?” 



n 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Kron asked diffidently. “I think 
I can cure you.” He leaned for- 
ward anxiously to get the man’s 
reply. 

“I’d take a helping hand from 
the devil himself, if it would do 
any good.” 

ICron’s eyes were brilliant. He 
hummed softly imder his breath, 
the Niobian equivalent of laugh- 
ter. “And all the time we 
thought—” he began, and then 
broke off abruptly. Already too 
much time was wasted without 
losing any more in meditating 
upon the ironies of life. 

He turned toward the firepit, 
searched for a moment among the 
stones, nodded with satisfaction 
and returned to where Lanceford 
lay. The hunthouse was deserted 
save for himself and the Earth- 
man. With characteristic Niobian 
delicacy, the hunters had left, pre- 
ferring to endure the night rain 
than be present when the alien 
died. Kron was thankful that they 
were gone, for what he was about 
to do would shock their conserva- 
tive souls. 

T ANCEFORD was dimly con- 
scious of Kron prying his 
swollen jaws apart and forcing 
something wet and slippery down 
his throat. He swallowed, the act 
a tearing pain to the edematous 
membranes of his gullet, but the 
stuff slid down, leaving a trail of 
fire in its wake. The act triggered 



another wave of pain that left him 
weak and gasping. He couldn’t 
take much more of this. It 
wouldn’t be long now before the 
swelling invaded his lungs to such 
a degree that he would strangle. 
It wasn’t a pleasant way to die. 

And then, quite suddenly, the 
pain eased. A creeping numbness 
spread like a warm black blanket 
over his outraged nervoxis system. 
The stuff Kron had given him ap- 
parently had some anesthetic 
properties. He felt dimly grateful, 
even though the primitive native 
nostrum would probably do no 
good other than to ease the pain. 

The blackness went just far 
enough to paralyze the superficial 
areas of his nervous system. It 
stopped the pain and left him un- 
able to move, but the deeper 
pathways of thought and reason 
remained untouched. He was con- 
scious, although no external sen- 
sation intruded on his thoughts. 
He couldn’t see Kron — the mus- 
cles that moved his eyes were as 
paralyzed as the other muscles of 
his body and the native was out- 
side his field of vision — but some- 
how he knew exactly what the Ni- 
obian was doing. He was washing 
mucus from his hands in a bowl 
of water standing beside the fire 
pit and he was wondering wryly 
whether forced feeding was on the 
list of human tabus! 

Lanceford’s mind froze, locked 
in a peculiar contact that was

more than awareness. The sensa^ 
tion was indescribable. It was like 
looking through an open door into 
the living room of a stranger’s 
house. 

He was aware of the incredible 
complexity and richness of Kron’s 
thoughts, of oddly sardonic laugh- 
ter, of pity and regret that such a 
little thing as understanding 
should cause death and suffering 
through its lack, of bewildered ad- 
miration for the grim persistence 
of the alien Eiarthmen, mixed with 
a wondering curiosity about what 
kept them here — what the true 
reasons were for their death-defy- 
ing persistence and stubbornness 
— of an ironic native paraphrase 
for the Terr an saying, “Every 
man to his own taste,” and a pro- 
found speculation up>on what 
fruits might occur from true un- 
derstanding between his own race 
and the aliens. 

It was a strangely jumbled ka- 
leidoscopic flash that burned 
across the explorer’s isolated 
mind, a flash that passed almost 
as soon as it had come, as though 
an invisible door had closed upon 
it. 

But one thing in that briefly 
shocking contact stood out with 
great clarity. The Niobians were 
as eager as the BEE to establish 
a true contact, a true imderstand- 
ing, for the message was there, 
plain in Kron’s mind that he was 
thinking not only for himself but 

94 



for a consensus of his people, a 
decision arrived at as a result of 
discussion and thought — a deci- 
sion of which every Niobian was 
aware and with which most Nio- 
bians agreed. 

^^HE magnitude of that thought 
and its implications staggered 
Lanceford’s imagination. 

After two years of exploration 
and contact with the dominant 
race of this planet, the BEE still 
knew literally nothing about the 
sort of people with whom they 
were dealing. This instantaneous, 
neural contact proved that 
Equated against the information 
dished out in Basic Training, it 
merely emphasized the fact that 
the BEE was grossly ignorant 

Anthropological Intelligence 
had a lot to account for — the job 
they’d done so far could have 
been performed by low-grade mo- 
rons. In wishing to avoid the pos- 
sibility of giving offense, in hiding 
behind a wall of courtesy and con- 
vention, there had been no con- 
tact worthy of the name. Yet here 
was the possibility of a rapport 
that could be closer than any 
which existed between any races 
in the Galaxy. 

Lanceford groaned with silent 
frustration. To learn this when he 
was dying was the bitterest of 
ironies. In any other circum- 
stances, the flash of insight could 
be parlayed into a key which 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



might imlock the entire problem 
of Niobian relationships. 

Bitterly he fought against the 
curtain of unconsciousness that 
closed down on him, trying by 
sheer will to stay awake, to make 
some move that could be inter- 
preted, to leave some clue to what 
he had learned. 

It was useless. The darkness 
closed in, inexorable and irresis- 
tible. 



A RTHUR LANCEFORD 
opened his eyes, surprised 
that he was still alive. The pain 
was gone from his face and the 
swelling had subsided. He grinned 
with relief — his luck had held 
out. 

And then the relief vanished in 
a wave of elation. He held the 
key. He knew the basics for mu- 
tual understanding. And he would 
be alive to deliver them to the 
specialists who could make them 
of>erate. 

He chuckled. Whatever the 
cure was — the BEE drug, Kron’s 
treatment, whatever it was, it 
didn’t matter. The important 
thing was that he was going to 
live. 

He wondered whether that flash 
of insight just before unconscious- 
ness had been real or a figment 
of delirium. It could have been 
either, but Lanceford clung to the 
belief that the contact was genu- 
ine. There was far too much re- 



vealed in that sudden flash that 
was entirely alien to his normal 
patterns of thought. 

He wondered what had trig- 
gered that burst of awareness. 
The BEE drug, the stuff Kron 
had given him, the poison of the 
sith and the histamines floating 
around in his S3^tem — it could 
have been any one of a number 
of things, or maybe a complex of 
various factors that had inter- 
acted to make him super-recep- 
tive for an instant of time. 

It was something that would 
have to be reported and studied 
with the meticulous care which the 
BEE gave to any facet of experi- 
ence that was out of the ordinary. 
A solution might possibly be 
found, or the whole thing might 
wind up as one of those dead ends 
that were so numerous in Explo- 
ration work. But that was out of 
his field and, in consequence, out 
of his hands. His specialty wasn’t 
parapsychological research. 

Kron was standing beside his 
bed, long doglike face impassive, 
looking at him with pleased satis- 
faction. Behind him, a group of 
natives were clustered around the 
cooking fire. It was as if no time 
had passed since the allergy 
struck — but Lanceford knew dif- 
ferently. Still, the lost time didn’t 
matter. The bright joy that he 
was going to live transcended 
such unimp>ortant things. 

“Looks like you won’t have to 



SURVIVAL TYPE 



95 



bury me after all,” Lanceford said 
happily. 

He stretched his arms over his 
head. He felt wonderful. His body 
was cool and comfortably free of 
the hot confinement of the protec- 
tion suit. He did a slow horrified 
doubletake as he realized that he 
was lying on the sleeping plat- 
form practically naked — a tempt- 
ing hors d’oeuvre for the thousand 
and one species of Niobe’s biting 
insects. 

“Where’s my suit?” he half 
shouted. 

K RON smiled. “You don’t need 
it, friend Lanceford. If you 
will notice, you are not bitten. 
Nor will you be.” 

“Why not?” 

Kron didn’t answer. It wasn’t 
the proper time, and the euphoria 
that he and the Earthman were 
enjoying was too pleasant to shat- 
ter. 

Lanceford didn’t press the mat- 
ter. Apparently Kron knew what 
he was talking about. Lanceford 
had been watching one particu- 
larly vicious species of biting fly 
hover above his body. The insect 
would approach, ready to enjoy a 
mandible full of human epider- 
mis, but, about six inches from his 
body, would slow down and come 
to a stop, hanging frustrated in 
midair. Finally the fly gave up 
and flew off into the darkness of 
the rafters. Lanceford hoped that 

96 



one of the spiders would get it— 
but he was convinced. Whatever 
happened to him while he was 
unconscious had made him as in- 
sect-repellent as the Niobians. 

The smell of cooking came 
from the firepit and, incredibly, it 
smelled good. 

Lanceford looked startledly at 
Kron. “I’m hungry.” 

“An excellent sign,” Kron re- 
plied. “You are nearly cured. Soon 
you will be able to finish this 
trek.” 

“Incidentally,” Lanceford said, 
“for the first time since I have 
been out on this showerbath 
world of yours, you’re cooking 
something that smells fit to eat. I 
think I'd like to try it.” 

Kron’s eyebrows rose and he 
hummed softly under his breath. 
This was something entirely unex- 
pected — an added delight, like 
the flavor of komal in a sorat 
stew. He savored it slowly, enjoy- 
ing its implications. 

‘What is it?” Lanceford per- 
sisted. 

“A dish called akef,” Kron said. 
The name was as good as any and 
certainly described the effect well 
enough. 

'^HE last hundred miles had 
been a breeze. Lanceford 
stood at the edge of the clearing, 
looking across the planed - off 
landscape to the shimmering hemi- 
spherical bulk of Base Alpha, glis- 

6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tening like a giant cabochon jewel 
under Niobe’s dark sky. Without 
the protection suit to slow him 
down and hamper his movements, 
what would have been a week’s 
trip had been shortened to four 
days. 

In a few minutes, he would be 
back among his own kind — and 
he wasn’t sure whether he was 
glad or sorry. Of course, there was 
a certain satisfaction in bringing 
back a first-class discovery — per- 
haps the greatest in the short his- 
tory of Niobian exploration — but 
there was a stigma attached to 
the way it had been found. It 
wouldn’t be easy to confess that 
it had practically been forced 
upon him, but it would have to be 
done. It would have been much 
nicer to have found the answer by 
using his head. There would have 
been some really deserved pres- 
tige in that. 

H e sighed and turned to Kron. 

“Farewell, friend,” he said 
soberly, “and thanks.” 

“We are even,” Kron replied. 
“You saved my life from a roka 
and I saved yours from the sith. 
The scales are balanced.” 

Lanceford blinked. He had for- 
gotten that incident where he had 
shot the big catlike animal shortly 
after the ’copter had dropped 
them for the start of their journey 
back to Base. Apparently it was 
after Kron — or at least the native 



had thought so. Lanceford grinned 
ruefully. Score another point for 
blind luck. 

“But, Kron, it’s not that easy. 
You have given me a secret of 
your people and I shall have to 
tell it to mine.” 

“I expected that you would. Be- 
sides, it is no secret. Even our 
children know its composition and 
how to make it. We have never 
held it from you. You simply 
wouldn’t accept it But it is about 
time, friend Lanceford, that your 
race began learning something of 
Niobe if they wish to remain here 
— and it is about time that we be- 
gan learning something about you. 
I think that there will be some 
rather marked changes in the fu- 
ture. And in that regard, I leave 
you with the question of whether 
a civilization should be judged en- 
tirely upon its apparent techno- 
logical achievements.” 

“I — ” Lanceford began. 

“You have learned how we 
avoid the insects,” Kron contin- 
ued, maneuvering past the abor- 
tive interruption, “and perhaps 
someday you will know the full 
answer to my question. But in the 
meantime, you and your kind will 
be free to move through our 
world, to learn our ways, and to 
teach us yours. It should be a fair 
exchange.” 

“Thanks to akef,” Lanceford 
said fervently, “we should be able 
to do just that.”

I^RON smiled. “You have used 
-®-^the drug enough to have 
overcome the mental block that 
prevented you from naming it be- 
fore. The word I coined from 
your own language of science is 
no longer necessary.” 

“I suppose not, but it’s pleas- 
anter to think of it that way.” 

“You Earthmen! Sometimes I 
wonder how you ever managed to 
achieve a civilization with your 
strange attitudes toward unpleas- 
ant facts.” Kron smiled broadly, 
relishing the memory of his de- 
ception and Lanceford’s shocked 
awakening to the truth. “I hope,” 
he continued, “that you have for- 
given my little deceit and the de- 
struction of your protective cloth- 
ing.” 

“Of course. How could I do 
otherwise? It’s so nice to be rid 
of that sweatbox that I’d forgive 
anything.” Lanceford frowned. 
“But there’s one thing that puz- 
zles me. How did you disguise 
the stuff?” 

“I didn’t,” Kron replied crypti- 
cally. “You did.” He turned away 
and, with characteristic Niobian 
abruptness, walked off into the 
jungle. His job was done and na- 
tives were never ones to dally 
with leavetaking, although their 
greetings were invariably ceremo- 
nious. 

Lanceford watched until the 
native was out of sight and then 
walked slowly across the clearing 

98 



toward the dome. He had learned 
a lot these past few days, enough 
to make him realize that his basic 
training had been so inadequate 
as to be almost criminal. It was 
lacking in many of the essentials 
for survival and, moreover, was 
slanted entirely wrong from a 
psychological point of view. 

Sure, it was good enough to 
enable a man to get along, but it 
seemed to be particularly de- 
signed to deny the fact that the 
natives obviously possessed a 
first-rate culture of their own. It 
didn’t say so directly, but the im- 
plications were there. And that 
was wrong. The natives possessed 
a civilization that was probably 
quite as high as the one Terra 
possessed. It was simply oriented 
differently. One thing was certain 
— the Confederation wasn’t going 
to expropriate or exploit this 
planet without the natives’ con- 
sent. It would be suicide if they 
tried. 

He grinned. Actually there 
would be no reason for such ac- 
tion. It was always easier to deal 
with advanced races than to try 
to conquer or educate primitive 
ones. Kron had the right idea — 
understanding, exchange, appreci- 
ation — Confederation culture for 
Niobian. It would make a good 
and productive synthesis. 

Still grinning, Lanceford opened 
the airlock and stepped inside, 
ignoring the pop-eyed guard who 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




eyed his shorts and sandals with 
an expression of incredulous dis- 
belief. 

A LVORD SIMS, Regional Di- 
rector, Niobe Division BEE, 
looked up from his desk and 
smiled. The smile became a nose- 
wrinkling grimace as Lanceford 
swxmg the pack from his shoul- 



ders and set it carefully on the 
floor. 

“Glad to see that you made it, 
Lanceford,” Sims said. “But what’s 
that awful smell? You should 
have done something about it. 
You stink like a native.” 

“All the baths in the world 
won’t help, sir,” Lanceford said 
woodenly.

He was tired of the stares and 
the sniffs he had encountered 
since he had entered the base. In 
his present condition, a fellow- 
human smelled as bad to him as 
he did to them, but he didn’t com- 
plain about it and he saw no rea- 
son why they should. Humanity 
should apply more courtesy and 
consideration to members of their 
own species. 

“It’s inside me,” he explained. 
“My metabolism’s changed. And 
incidentally, sir, you don’t smell 
so sweet yourself.” 

Sims sputtered for a moment 
and then shrugged. “Perhaps not,” 
he admitted. “One can’t help 
sweating in this climate even with 
air-conditioning.” 

“It’s the change inside me,” 
Lanceford said. “I suppose it’ll 
wear off in time, once I’ve been 
on a normal diet. But I didn’t 
think that was too important in 
view of the information I have. 
I’ve learned something vital, some- 
thing that you should know at 
once. That’s why I’m here.” 
“That’s decent of you,” Sims re- 
plied, “but an interoffice memo 
would have served just as well as 
a personal visit. My stomach isn’t 
as good as it once was. Ulcers, 
you know.” 

“The executive’s disease,” 
Lanceford commented. 

Sims nodded. “Well, Arthur, 
what did you find that was so im- 
portant?” 

100 



“That we’ve been fools.” 

Sims sighed. “That’s nothing 
new. We’ve been fools since the 
day we left Earth to try and con- 
quer the stars.” 

“That’s not what I mean, sir, I 
mean that we’ve been going at 
this Niobe business the wrong 
way. What we need is to under- 
stand the natives, instead of try- 
ing to understand the planet.” 
“Out of the mouth's of babes 
and probationers — " Sims said 
with gentle irony. 

“It pays off,” Lanceford replied 
doggedly. “Take my case. I’ve 
found out why the natives are in- 
sect-proof!” 

“That’s a new wrinkle. Can you 
prove it?” 

“Certainly. I came the last hun- 
dred miles in shorts.” 

‘What happened to your suit?” 
“Kron destroyed it acciden- 
tally.” 

“Accidentally — hah!” Sims 
snorted. “Niobians never do things 
accidentally.” 

T ANCEFORD looked sharply 
" at the director. The observa- 
tion carried a wealth of implica- 
tions that his sharpened senses 
were quick to grasp. “Then you 
know the natives aren’t simple 
savages, the way we were taught 
in Basic Training?” 

“Of course! They’re a non-tech- 
nical Class V at the very least — 
maybe higher. Somehow they’ve 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



never oriented their civilization 
along mechanical lines, or maybe 
they tried it once and fotmd it 
wanting. But no one in the upper 
echelons has ever thought they 
were stupid or uncivilized.” 

“Then why—” 

“Later,” Sims said. “You’re en- 
titled to an explanation, but right 
now Fd appreciate it if you’d fin- 
ish your statement. What makes 
the natives insect-proof?” 
“Vorkum.” 

“That gunk?” 

“That’s the repellent” 

“In more ways than one,” Sims 
said. 

“It’s not so bad after you get 
used to it. It just smells awful at 
first.” 

“That’s an understatement, if I 
ever heard one.” 

iii'DERHAPS the lab can ana- 
lyze it and find the active 
principle,” Lanceford said hope- 
fully. 

“If they do, Fll bet it is dis- 
tilled quintessence of skimk,” 
Sims replied gloomily. “Fll be 
willing to bet that our native 
friends tried that trick ages ago 
and gave it up for a bad job. 
They’re pretty fair biochemists as 
well as being philosophers.” 
“Could be,” Lanceford said 
thoughtfully. “I never thought of 
that.” 

“You’d better start thinking all 
the time. These lads are smart. 



Why do you think we have this 
complicated rigmarole about na- 
tive relations and respect? Man, 
we’re running scared. We don’t 
want to lose this planet, and any- 
thing less than the kid-glove treat- 
ment would be sheer suicide until 
we learn how far we can go. 
These natives have an organiza- 
tion thaFd knock your eye out. 
I didn’t believe it myself until I 
got the proof; As you learn more 
about it, you’ll understand what I 
mean. We’re dealing with an eco- 
logical unit on this planet!” 

“But I thought—” 

“That you were here to explore 
a primitive world?” 

“Wasn’t that what I was trained 
for?” 

“No. We can do that sort of 
thing with a couple of geodetic 
cruisers. We don’t need men trek- 
king through the jungles to assay 
a world’s physical resources. That 
business went out of date during 
the Dark Ages. There’s a better 
reason than that for these treks.” 

“Like what?” 

“You asked the question. Now 
answer it,” Sims said. “You have 
enough data.” 

Lanceford thought for a mo- 
ment. “I can see one reason,” he 
said slowly. 

“Yes?” 

“The trek could be a test. It 
could be used to determine 
whether or not the probationer 
was a survival type — a sort of

final examination before he’s 
turned loose in a responsible job 
here in the BEE.” 

QIMS smiled. “Bull’s-eye! It’s 
part of the speedup — a pretty 
brutal part, but one that can’t be 
helped if we want to get this 
planet in line quickly enough to 
stop the riot that’s brewing in the 
Confederation. It’s as much for 
Niobe’s good as ours, because the 
Confederation wants that gerontin 
like an alcoholic wants another 
drink — and they’re not going to 
wait for normal exploration and 
development. That’s why the 
treks. It’s a tough course. Failure 
can and often does mean death. 
Usually we can pull a misfit out 
in time, but not always. If you 
live through the trek and we don’t 
have to pull you out, though, 
you’ve proved yourself a survival 
type — and you’re over the first 
hurdle. 

“Then we check with your 
guide and anyone you happen to 
meet en route. The natives are 
very cooperative about such 
things. If you pass their evalua- 
tion, you’re ready to join the club. 
It’s been forming ever since we 
landed here two years ago, but it’s 
still pretty exclusive. It’s the nu- 
cleus of the bee’s mission here, 
the one that’ll get things rolling 
with the gerontin plantations. 
We’ll know about you in a few 
more minutes after the Cyb Unit 

102 



gets through processing your 
data.” Sims grinned at the thun- 
derstruck youngster. 

Lanceford nodded glumly. ‘Til 
probably fail. I sure didn’t use 
my head. I never caught the sig- 
nificance of the trek, I failed to 
deduce the reason for the insect- 
repellent qualities of the natives, 
and I missed the implications of 
their culture imtil I had almost 
reached Base. Those things are 
obvious. Any analytical brain 
would have figured them out.” 

“They’re only obvious when 
you know what you’re looking 
for,” Sims said gently. ‘Terson- 
ally, I think you did an excellent 
job, considering the handicaps 
you have faced. And the discov- 
ery of the vorkum was masterly.” 

Lanceford blushed. “I hate to 
admit it, but Kron literally 
shoved the stuff down my throat.” 

“I didn’t mean the method by 
which you learned that vorkum 
was the stuff we’ve been searching 
for,” Sims said. “I meant the re- 
sults you obtained. Results are 
what count in this business. Call 
it luck if you wish, but there is 
more to it than that Some peo- 
ple are just naturally lucky and 
those are the sort we need here. 
The}r’re survival types. A lot is 
going to depend on having those 
so-called lucky people in the right 
places when we settle Niobe’s 
status in the Confederation.” 

He paused as the message tube 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



beside his desk burped a faint hiss 
of compressed air and a carrier 
dropped out into the receiving 
basket. 

“Somehow I think that this is 
your membership card to the 
club, he said. He read it, smiled, 
and passed the sheet to Lance- 
ford. “And now, Arthur, before I 
appoint you as a Niobe Staff 
member, Fd like to know one 
thing.” 

“What is that, sir?” 

“Just why in the name of hell 
did you bring that pack in here 
with you? Fve just realized where 
that smell is coming from!” 

“I didn’t dare leave it any- 
where,” Lanceford said. “Someone 
might have thrown it down a dis- 
posal chute.” 

“I wouldn’t blame them. That’s 
vorkum you have in there, isn’t 
it?” 

Lanceford nodded. “Yes, sir. 
I didn’t want to lose it.” 

‘Why not? We can always get 
more from the natives if we need 
it.” 

“I know that, sir. We can, but 
this is all Fll get for the next six 
months, and if I ration myself 
carefully, it might last that long. 
You see, sir, it’s mildly habit- 
forming — like cigarettes — and 
one gets accustomed to it. And 
besides, you really don’t know 
what flavor is until you’ve tried 
vorkum on chocolate.”

Frankly, I’m siuprised that 
you’re surprised. Just because I 
know enough math and ph3rsics to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be in Astro, why should I be an 
uncultured redneck? No, sir, I’ve 
traveled around and I spent as 
much time in the museums of 
Europe as I did in the taverns. 

I’ll admit my companions on 
the Moon trip looked a bit ask- 
ance at me because of that. They 
weren’t robots, either, but there 
was so much to learn, it didn’t 
seem that one human skull could 
hold it all. Down imderneath, I 
think they were afraid my memo- 
ries of the Virgin of the Rocks — 
the one in London, I mean, that’s 
the best one — would crowd out 
my memories of orbital fimctions. 
So I made a point of showing off 
all the astrogational knowledge I 
had, during rehearsals, and it may 
have antagonized Baird a little. 

Not that we had any fights. We 
were a tightly woven team when 
the Benjamin Franklin left the 
space station and blowtorched 
for the Moon. It’s just — well, 
maybe we were somewhat more 
tense than we would have been 
otherwise. 

^ INHERE were three of us, you 
remember. Baird was the skip- 
per and pilot, Hernandez the en- 
gineer, and I the instrument man. 
A single person could have han- 
dled the ship if nothing went 
wrong, but three were insurance 
— any one of us could do any of 
the other jobs. Also, of course, 
since this was to be the first ac- 



tual landing on the Moon, not 
merely a swing aroimd it, we 
thought our numbers were peeled 
down to the bare minimum. 

Once in orbit, we hadn’t much 
to do for several days. We floated 
upward, watching Earth recede 
and Luna grow against the deep- 
est, blackest, starriest night you 
have ever imagined. No, you 
haven’t imagined it, either. Pic- 
tures don’t convey it, the splendor 
and loneliness. 

It was very quiet in the ship. 
We talked of little things, to keep 
that silence at arm’s length. I re- 
member one conversation pretty 
well and it touches on the why of 
all this secrecy. 

Earth hung sapphire in the 
middle of darkness and the stars. 
Long white auroral streamers 
shook from the poles like ban- 
ners. Did you know that, seen 
from such a distance, our planet 
has belts? Very much like Jupi- 
ter. It’s harder than you’d believe 
to distinguish the continental out- 
lines. 

“I think that’s Russia coming 
into view,” I said. 

Baird glanced at the chrono- 
meters and the orbital schedule 
taped to the wall, and worked his 
slipstick a minute. “Yeah,” he 
grunted. “Siberia ought to be 
emerging from the terminator 
right about now.” 

“Are they watching us?” mur- 
mured Hernandez. 



THE LIGHT 



IDS 



“Sure,” I said, “They’ve got a 
space station of their own, haven’t 
they, and good telescopes on it?” 
“Won’t they grin if we barge 
into a meteor!” said Hernandez. 

“If they haven’t already ar- 
ranged an accident,” grumbled 
Baird. “I’m not a damn bit sure 
they’re behind us in astronautics.” 
“They wouldn’t be sorry to see 
us come to grief,” I said, “but I 
doubt if the3r’d actually sabotage 
us. Not a trip like this, with 
everybody watching.” 

“It might start the war?” said 
Baird. “Not a chance. Nobody’s 
going to wipe out a nation — 
knowing his own will be clob- 
bered, too — for three spacemen 
and a ten-million-dollar himk of 
ship.” 

“Sure,” I replied, “but one 
thing can lead to another. A diplo- 
matic note C6tn be the first link in 
a chain ending at war. With the 
antipodal hydrogen missile avail- 
able to both sides, you get an in- 
teresting state of affairs. The pri- 
mary aim of national policy has 
become the preservation of the 
status quo, but at the same time 
the tension created makes that 
status quo exceedingly unstable. 

“Do you think our own govern- 
ment would be sending us to the 
Moon if there were any military 
benefit to be gained? Hell, no! 
The first thing which looks as 
though it will tip the balance in 
favor of one side will make the 

106 



other side go to war, and that 
means the probable end of civili- 
zation. We gain points — prestige 
— by the first Limar landing, but 
not a nickel more. Even as it is, 
you’ll note the Moon is going to 
be international territory directly 
under the UJ*!. That is, nobody 
dares claim it, because there just 
might be something of real stra- 
tegic value there.” 

OW long can such a bal- 

-*"*■ ance exist?” wondered 
Hernandez. 

“Till some accident — say, a 
hothead getting into power in 
Russia, or anywhere else, for that 
matter — touches off the attack 
and the retaliation,” I said. “Or 
there’s the faint hope that we’ll 
come up with a gadget absolutely 
revolutionary — oh, a force screen 
able to shield a continent — be- 
fore they have any inkling of it. 
Then we’ll present the world with 
a fait accompli and the Cold War 
will be over.” 

“Unless the Russians get that 
screen first,” said Hernandez. 
‘Then it’ll be over, too, but the 
bad guys will have won the blood- 
less victory.” 

“Shut up,” snapped Baird. “You 
both talk too much.” 

It had been the wrong thing 
for me to say, I knew, out there 
in the great quiet night. We 
shouldn’t have carried our little 
hates and fears and greeds be- 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



yond the sky and out into space. 

Or perhaps the fact that we can 
be burdened with them and still 
reach the Moon shows that Man 
is bigger than he knows. I couldn’t 
say. 

The waiting wore us down, that 
and the free-fall. It’s easy enough 
to get used to zero gravity while 
you’re awake, but your instincts 
aren’t so docile. We’d go to sleep 
and have nightmares. Toward the 
end of the trip, it happened less 
often, so I suppose you can get 
completely adjusted in time. 

But we felt no dramatic sense 
of pioneering when we came 
down. We were very tired and 
very tense. It was merely a hard 
breakneck job. 

Our landing site hadn’t been 
chosen exactly, since a small or- 
bital error could make a big dif- 
ference as far as the Lunar sur- 
face was concerned. We could 
only be sure that it would be near 
the north pole and not on one of 
the maria, which look invitingly 
smooth but are probably treach- 
erous. In point of fact, as you re- 
member, we landed at the foot of 
the Lunar Alps, not far from the 
crater Plato. It was rugged coun- 
try, but our gear had been de- 
signed for such a place. 

And when the thunder of blasts 
had faded and our deafened ears 
tolled slowly toward quiet, we sat. 
We sat for minutes without a 
word being spoken. My clothes 



were plastered to me with sweat. 

‘Well,” said Baird at length. 
•Well, here we are.” 

He unstrapped himself and 
reached for the mike and called 
the station. Hernandez and I 
crowded the periscopes to see 
what lay outside. 

T T WAS eerie. I’ve been in 
deserts on Earth, but they 
don’t blaze so bright, they aren’t 
so absolutely dead, and the rocks 
aren’t so huge and razor-cornered. 
The southern horizon was near; I 
thought I could see the surface 
curve away and tumble off into a 
foam of stars. 

Presently we drew lots. Her- 
nandez got the small one and 
stayed inside, while I had the 
privilege of first setting foot on 
the Moon. Baird and I donned 
our spacesuits and clumped out 
through the airlock. Even on 
Luna, those suits weighed plenty. 

We stood in the shadow of the 
ship, squinting through glare fil- 
ters. It wasn’t a totally black, 
knife-edged shadow — there was 
reflection from the ground and 
the hills — but it was deeper and 
sharper than any you’ll see on 
Earth. Behind us, the mountains 
rose high and cruelly shaped. 
Ahead of us, the land sloped 
rough, cracked, ocherous toward 
the rim of Plato, where it shoul- 
dered above that toppling hori- 
zon. The light was too brilliant 



THE LIGHT

for me to see many stars. 

You may recall we landed near 
sunset and figured to leave short- 
ly after dawn, two weeks later. At 
night on the Moon, the tempera- 
ture reaches 250 below zero, but 
the days are hot enough to fry 
you. And it’s easier — takes less 
mass — to heat the ship from the 
pile than to install a refrigerating 
imit 

“Well,” said Baird, “go ahead.” 

“Go ahead and what?” I asked. 

“Make the speech. You’re the 
first man on the Moon.” 

“Oh, but you’re the captain,” I 
said. ‘Wouldn’t dream of — no, 
no. Boss. I insist.” 

You probably read that speech 
in the papers. It was supposed to 
have been extemporaneous, but it 
was written by the wife of some- 
body way upstairs who believed 
her claim to be a poet. A verbal 
emetic, wasn’t it? And Baird 
wanted me to deliver it! 

“This is mutiny,” he grumbled. 

“May I suggest that the captain 
write in the log that the speech 
was delivered?” I said. 

“Judas priest!” he snarled. But 
he did that, later. You understand 
you’re hearing this under the Top 
Secret label, don’t you? 

Baird remained in a foul tem- 
per. “Get some rock samples,” he 
ordered, setting up the camera. 
“And on the double! Fm being 
cooked alive.” 

I picked loose some of the ma- 



terial, thinking that the traces I 
left would probably last till the 
Sun burned out It seemed an act 
of desecration, though Lord knew 
this landscape was ugly enough — 
No, I thought, it wasn’t. It was 
only so foreign to us. Do you 
know, it was several hours before 
I could really see everything? It 
took that long for my brain to get 
used to some of those impressions 
and start registering them. 

"IJ AIRD was taking pictures. “I 
wonder if this lighting can be 
photographed,” I remarked. “It 
isn’t like anything that ever shone 
on Earth.” And it wasn’t. I can’t 
describe the difference. Think of 
some of the weird illuminations 
we get on Earth — like that 
brass-colored light just before a 
storm, things like that — and 
multiply the strangeness of them 
a millionfold. 

“Of course it’ll photograph,” 
said Baird. 

“Oh, yes. In a way,” I said. “But 
to get the feel of it, you’d need 
such a painter as hasn’t lived for 
centuries. Rembrandt? No, it’s 
too harsh for him, a cold light 
that’s somehow hell-hot, too — ” 
“Shut up!” The radio voice 
nearly broke my earphones. “You 
and your blasted Renaissance!” 
After a while, we went inside 
again. Baird was still mad at me. 
Unreasonable, but he’d been xm- 
der a breaking strain, and he still 



108

was, and perhaps this wasn’t the 
right place to chat about art. 

We fiddled around with our in- 
struments, took what observa- 
tions were possible, had a meal 
and a nap. The shadows crept 
across the land as the Sun rolled 
downhill. It was a very slow 
movement. Hernandez examined 
my rock samples and said that 
while he wasn’t a geologist, this 
didn’t look like anything on 
Earth. We were told later that it 
was new to the experts. Same 
minerals, but crystallized differ- 
ently under those fantastic condi- 
tions. 

After our rest, we noticed that 
the low Sun and the irregular 
landscape had joined to give us a 
broad, nearly continuous band of 
shade clear to Plato Crater. Her- 
nandez suggested we use the 
chance to explore. It would be 
after sunset before we could get 
back, but the ground wouldn’t 
cool off so fast that we couldn’t 
return with the help of our bat- 
tery packs. In sunless vacuum, 
you don’t lose heat very fast by 
radiation; it’s the Lunar rock, cold 
to the core, which sucks it out 
through your boots. 

Baird argued, for the record, 
but he was eager himself. So, in 
the end, we all set out and to hell 
with doctrine. 

I won’t describe that walk in 
detail. I can’t It wasn’t simply 
the landscape and the lighting. 



On the Moon, your weight is only 
one-sixth as much as on Earth, 
while the inertia remains the 
same. It feels a bit like walking 
imder water. But you can move 
fast once you get the hang of it 

When we came to the ringwall, 
there were still a couple of hours 
till sundown, and we climbed it 
Tricky work in that undiffused 
dazzle and those solid-looking 
shadows, but not very hard. There 
was an easy slope at the spot we 
picked and a kind of pass on top, 
so we didn’t have to climb the 
full height which is a little under 
4000 feet 

Vj^HEN we reached the sum- 
” mit, we could look down on 
a lava plain sixty miles across; 
the farther side was hidden from 
us. It seemed almost like polished 
black metal, crossed by the long 
shadow of the western ringwalL 
The downward grade was steep>er, 
its base lost in darkness, but it 
could also be negotiated. 

My helmet sticking into the di- 
rect sunlight was a Dutch oven; 
my feet in the shade, were frozen 
clods. But I forgot all that when 
I saw the mist below me. 

Have you heard of it? Astron- 
omers have noticed it for a long 
time, what seemed to be clouds 
or — something — in some of the 
craters. Plato is one. Fd been 
hoping we’d solve the mystery 
this trip. And there, cxirling in

ragged streamers a quarter mile 
below me, was the fog! 

It boiled out of the murk, 
glowed like gold for a moment as 
it hit the light, and then it was 
gone, evaporated, but more came 
rolling up every minute. Not a big 
patch, this one couldn’t have been 
seen from Earth, but — 

I started down the wall. “Hey!” 
cried Baird. “Get back here!” 
“Just a look,” I pleaded. 

“And you break yoiu" leg and 
have to be carried home, with the 
night coming on? No!” 

“I can’t break an3rthing in this 
suit,” I told him. True enough. 
Space armor is solid metal on the 
outside — even those trick ex- 
panding joints are metal — and 
the plastic helmet is equally 
strong. I suppose a man could 
fall hard enough to kill himself 
on the Moon, if he really tried, 
but it would take some doing. 

“Come back or I’ll have you 
court-martialed,” said Baird be- 
tween his teeth. 

“Show a heart, Skipper,” begged 
Hernandez. 

Eventually he talked Baird 
around. It was only me the cap- 
tain was irritated with. We roped 
ourselves together and made a 
cautious descent. 

The mist was coming out of a 
fissure about halfway down the 
wall. Where the shadows fell, our 
lights showed it collecting in hoar- 
frost on the rocks, then boiling 



gently away again. After dark, 
it would settle as ice till dawn. 
What was it? Water. There’s a 
water table of some kind, I guess, 
and — I don’t know. It suggests 
there may be indigenous life on 
the Moon, some low form of plant 
life maybe, but we didn’t find any 
while we were there. What we 
found was — 

A BROAD ledge lay just be- 
neath the fissure. We scram- 
bled to it and stood looking up. 

Now you’ll have to visualize 
the layout. We were on this ledge, 
several yards across, with the ring- 
wall jutting sheer above and a 
cliff falling below into blackness. 
Far away, I could see the steely 
glimmer of the crater floor. The 
ground was all covered with the 
fine meteoric dust of millions of 
years; I saw my footprints sharp 
and clear and knew they might 
last forever, or until thermal agi- 
tation and new dustfall blurred 
them. 

Ten feet overhead was the fis- 
sure, like a petrified mouth, and 
the mist came out of it and 
smoked upward. It formed almost 
a roof, a thin ceiling between us 
and the sky. And the Sun was be- 
hind the upper wall, invisible to 
us. The peaks reflected some of 
its beams down through the fog. 

So we stood there in a cold, 
faintly golden-white radiance, a 
fog-glow — God! There’s never 



THE LIGHT 



111 



been such light on Earth! It 
seemed to pervade everything, 
drenching us, cold and white, like 
silence made luminous. It was 
the light of Nirvana. 

And I had seen it once before. 

I couldn’t remember where. I 
stood there in that totally alien 
dream-light, with the mist swirl- 
ing and ^breaking overhead, with 
the stillness of eternity humming 
in my earphones and my soul, 
and I forgot everything except the 
chill, calm, incredible loveliness of 
it — 

But I had seen it somewhere, 
sometime, and I couldn’t remem- 
ber — 

Hernandez yelled. 

Baird and I jerked from our 
thoughts and lumbered to him. 
He stood crouched a few feet 
away, staring and staring. 

I looked at the ground and 
something went hollow in me. 
There were footprints. 

We didn’t even ask if one of 
us had made them. Those weren’t 
American spaceboots. And they 
had come from below. They had 
climbed the wall and stood here 
for a while, scuffed and paced 
around, and presently we located 
the trail going back down. 

The silence felt like a fiddle 
string ready to snap. 

Baird raised his head at last 
and gazed before him. The light 
made his face a thing of unhuman 
beauty, and somewhere I had 

112 



seen a face lit that way. I had 
looked at it, losing myself, for 
half an hour or more, but when, 
in what forgotten dream? 

“Who?” whispered Baird. 

“There’s only one coimtry that 
could send a spaceship to the 
Moon secretly,” said Hernandez 
in a dead voice. 

“British,” I croaked. “French — ” 

“We’d know about it, if they 
had.” 

“Russians. Are they still here?” 
I looked down into the night well- 
ing up in Plato. 

“No telling,” said Baird. “Those 
tracks could be five hours or five 
million years old.” 

'^I^HEY were the prints of hob- 
nailed boots. They weren’t ex- 
cessively large, but judging from 
the length of the stride, even here 
on the Moon, they had belonged 
to a tall man. 

“Why haven’t they told the 
world?” asked Hernandez wildly. 
“They could brag it up so — ” 

“Why do you think?” rasped 
Baird. 

I looked south. Earth was in 
half phase, low above the horizon, 
remote and infinitely fair. I 
thought America was facing us, 
but couldn’t be sure. 

There was only one reason to 
keep this trip a secret. They had 
found something which would up- 
set the military balance, doubtless 
in their favor. At this moment, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



there on Earth, the Kremlin was 
readying the enslavement of all 
the human race. 

“But how could they have done 
it secretly?” I protested. 

“Maybe they took off in a black 
ship when our space station was 
on the other side of the planet. 
Shut up!” Baird stood without 
moving. 

The Sun went lower, that eld- 
ritch light died away, and the blue 
radiance of Earth took its place. 
Our faces'grew corpse-colored be- 
hind the helmets. 

“Come on,” said Baird. He 
whirled around. “Let’s get back 
to the ship. They have to know 
about this in Washington.” 

“If the Russians know we 
know, it may start the war,” I 
said. 

“I’ve got a code.” 

“Are you sure it can’t be 
broken? That it hasn’t already 
been?” 

“You trouble - making whelp!” 
he shouted in a fury. “Be quiet, I 
tell you!” 

“We’d better have a closer 
look,” said Hernandez gently. 
“Follow those prints and see.” 

“We didn’t bring any weapons,” 
said Baird. “I’d be surprised if the 
Russians were as careless.” 

I won’t detail the arguments. It 
was finally settled that I would 
look further while Baird and Her- 
nandez returned. I had about an 
hour to follow that trail, then 



must hurry home if I didn’t want 
to freeze solid. 

I looked back once and saw a 
space-armored shape black across 
the stars. There were more stars 
every minute as the sunlight 
faded and my pupils expanded. 
Then the shadows walled me in. 

It was a rough climb, but a 
quick one. The stone here was 
dark and brittle; I could track 
the stranger by the lighter spots 
where he’d flaked off chips as he 
scrambled. I wondered why those 
spots should be lighter when 
there was no oxygen around, but 
decided a photochemical effect 
was involved. 

It was hard to see my way in 
the shade. The flashbeam was 
only a puddle of undiffused light 
before me. But soon I came out 
in the E^rth-glow, and when my 
eyes had adjusted, it was easy 
enough. In half an hour, I was on 
the crater floor. The Sun was be- 
hind the ringwall. Black night lay 
over me. 

T^OT much time to spare. I 

’ stood on dark, slick lava and 
wondered whether to follow those 
dim footprints in the dust. It 
might be a long way. Then I 
shrugged and went bounding off, 
faster than the other man had 
gone. 

My heart thudded, the suit 
filled with stale air, it was hard 
to see the trail by Earthlight. I 



THE LIGHT 



113 



was more aware of those discom- 
forts than of any danger to my 
life. 

I was a little past the limit of 
safety when I found the camp. 

There wasn’t much to see. A 
long track of plowed dust and 
chipped stone, where something 
with runners had landed and 
taken off again . but no sign 
of a rocket blast! A few scars 
where a pick had removed sam- 
ples. Footprints. That was all. 

I stood there with the crater 
wall a loom of night behind me 
and the mist rising thicker, blue- 
tinged now. I stood thinking 
about somebody who landed with- 
out needing rockets and never 
told anyone. I looked around the 
sky and saw the ruddy sp>eck of 
Mars and felt cold. Had the Mar- 
tians beaten us to our own Moon? 

But I had to get back. Every 
minute I lingered whittled down 
the chance of my returning at all. 

One more look — 

There was a little outcrop of 
granite not far away. I thought it 
might be a cairn, but when I got 
there, I saw it was natural. I 
shrugged and turned to go. 

Something caught my eye. I 
looked closer. 

The rock was sleet-colored in 
the Earthlight It had one flat sur- 
face, facing my planet. And there 
was a cross hacked into the stone. 

I forgot time and the gathering 
cold. I stood there, thinking, won- 

114 



dering if the cross was merely a 
coincidental symbol or if there 
had also, on Mars or on some 
planet of another star, been One 
who — 

The million suns wheeled and 
glittered above me. 

Then I knew. I remembered 
where I had seen that light which 
lay on the wall at sundown, and 
I knew the truth. 

I turned and started running. 

¥ ALMOST didn’t make it. My 
-*■ batteries gave out five miles 
from the ship. I reported over the 
radio and continued moving to 
keep warm, but my feet quickly 
froze, I stumbled, and each min- 
ute the cold deepened. 

Baird met me halfway, ripped 
off my pack and connected an- 
other unit 

“You moron!” he snapped. “You 
blind, bloody, pudding-brained 
idiot! I’m going to have you up 
before a court-martial if — ” 

“Even if I tell you who that 
was in Plato?” I asked. 

“Huh?” 

We were in the ship and my 
toes thawing before he got me to 
explain. It took a lot of talking, 
but when he grasped the idea — 

Of course. Intelligence has been 
working overtime ever since we 
came home and told them. 
They’ve established now that 
there was no Russian exp>edition. 
But Baird and Hernandez and I 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have known it ever since our first 
night on the Moon. 

And that, Professor, is the rea- 
son you’ve been drafted. We’re 
going overseas together, officially 
as tourists. You’ll search the ar- 
chives and I’ll tell you if you’ve 
found anything useful. I doubt 
very much if you will. That secret 
was well kept, like the secret of 
the submarine, which he also 
thought should not be given to a 
warring world. But if somewhere, 
somehow, we find only a scribbled 
note, a hint. I’ll be satisfied. 

It couldn’t have been done by 
rockets, you see. Even if the 
physics had been known, which it 
wasn’t, the chemistry and metal- 
lurgy weren’t there. But some- 
thing else was stumbled on. Anti- 
gravity? Perhaps. Whatever it 



may be, if we can find it, the Cold 
War will be won ... by free men. 

Whether or not we dig up any 
notes, our research men are busy. 
Just knowing that such a gadget 
is p>ossible is a tremendous boost, 
so you can understand why this 
must be kept secret 

You don’t get it? Professor, I 
am shocked and grieved. And you 
a historian! A cultured man! 

All right, then. We’ll go via 
London and you’ll stop at the Na- 
tional Gallery and sit down in 
front of a painting called The 
Virgin of the Rocks. And you will 
see a light, cold and pale and 
utterly gentle, a light which never 
shone on Earth, pla3ung over the 
Mother and Child. And the artist 
was Leonardo da Vinci.

down to a frighteningly logical 
depiction of a civilization based 
on immortality as the supreme 
reward for a life of achievement. 

Unfortunately, immortality is 
for the few because cataclysmic 
wars have reduced the world to 
barbarism except for the smallish 
community of Clarges, and food 
supply and population are kept in 
strict balance. For each new 

116 



Amaranth, 2,000 ordinary mor- 
tals are visited by the Assassins. 
Since war and violence have been 
outlawed, the only areas of strife 
are in space flight and the strug- 
gle for immortality. 

Gavin Way lock is the angry 
protagonist, unjustly accused of 
deliberate murder and therefore 
deprived of his immortality. For 
seven years, he has hidden until, 
being declared legally dead, he is 
free to strive again for eternal life. 

The sick, inbred society of 
Vance’s imagination comes fully 
alive, even though his characters 
remain mere symbols.

ATOMIC QUEST by Arthur 
Holly Compton. Oxford Univer- 
sity Press, N. Y., $5.00 

A T THE time that Hiroshima 
literally burst into the aware- 
ness of the world, the general re- 
action was one of amazement that 
such an immense undertaking 
could have been achieved with 
such secrecy. More accustomed to 
effective security, we know that 
other wonders — and horrors — 
are under equally tight wraps to- 
day. 

Dr. Compton’s book, never too 
late to be welcome, treats with 
the now familiar names — Fermi, 
Oppenheimer, Urey, Conant, Law- 
rence, etc., and their often frus- 
trated approach to the conquest 
of the atom. 

Though Dr. Compton’s treat- 
ment keeps tending toward the 
textbookish, the drama and ten- 
sion of those historic days come 
through undiluted. 

THE IMMORTAL STORM by 
Sam Moskowitz. Atlanta Science 
Fiction Organization Press, Ga., 
$5.00 

r| R. COMPTON’S Atomic 
Quest, primarily a personal 
account of the individuals in- 
volved in the search for atomic 
power, is underplayed, being over- 
whelmed by the enormity of the 
subject. In contrast, Moskowitz’s 



book, pretentious title and all, is 
an account of the petty feuds of 
a handful of S-F fans in the dark 
days of the ’30s; depressing 
events during Depression days. 

The articulate handful monof>- 
olized the magazine letter col- 
umns and carried on their pigmy 
warfare to the despair of actual 
readers. Fortunately, most of 
these petulant warriors have since 
grown up — but their historian is 
still leading their ghostly legions 
in battles that are more real than 
today to him. The miracle is that 
S-F survived even the love of its 
most rabid fans. Direct from

MAN IN SEARCH OF HIS 
ANCESTORS by Andre Senet. 
McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., $5.50 

"DERHAPS as much time has 
been devoted to the question 
“From Whence?” as to the more 
immediate “Whither?” Senet is a 
most beguiling Whencer. His 
book takes on the intensity of a 
detective yam as he ranges over 
the entire planet, following the 
finds of eminent paleontologists 
tracing the origins of Man further 
and further into antiquity. 

Far from adhering to this nar- 
row field of investigation, how- 
ever, Senet takes the entire scope 
of terrestrial life, marine and 
land, under scrutiny. His chapter

FROM THE TABLETS OF 
SUMER by Samuel Noah 
Kramer. The Falcon’s Wing Press, 
Colo., $5.00 

U NTIL 100 years ago, no one 
had ever heard of Sumer or 
Sumerians. That they are now 
known to have been unique in 
many respects is due to the 
fastidious labors of specialized 
archeologists known as Sumerolo-

gists. Dr. Kramer takes a humor- 
ous view of his calling, referring 
to himself as a pinp>oint historian, 
concerned with the history of the 
tiny triangle formed by the Tigris 
and Euphrates Rivers only up to 
the time of Alexander the Great. 

The Sumerians had evolved a 
high civilization as early as 3,000 
B.C., with many historical firsts. 
They organized the first schools, 
literary debates, library cata- 
logues; assembled the first Phar- 
macopoeia, “Farmer’s Almanac” 
and bicameral congress and 
achieved the first recorded case of 
tax reduction. As you can see, a 
truly remarkable people.

O N HIS way across the 
wheel one morning, Dr. 
Walter Alvarez detoured 
down to C Level promenade. A 
few men were standing, as usual, 
at the view window looking out at 
the enormous blue-green planet 
below. They were dressed alike in 
sheen-gray coveralls, a garment 
with detachable gauntlets and 
hood designed to make it conver- 
tible into a spacesuit. It was un- 
comfortable, but regulation: ac- 
cording to the books, a Survey 
and Propaganda Satellite might 
find itself under attack at any 
moment. 

Nothing so interesting had hap- 
pened to SAPS 3 107 A, orbiting 
off the seventh planet of a G-type 
star in Ophiuchus. They had been 
here for two years and a half, and 
most of them had not even 
touched ground yet. 

There it was, drifting by out 
there, blue-green, fat and juicy — 
an oxygen planet, two-thirds land, 
mild climate, soil fairly bursting 
with minerals and organics. 

Alvarez felt his mouth watering 
when he looked at it. He had 
“wheel fever.” They all did. He 
wanted to get down there, to nat- 
ural gravity and natural ailments. 

The last month or so, there had 
been a feeling in the satellite that 
a breakthrough was coming. Al- 
ways coming: it never arrived.

AN EYE FOR A WHATT 



121 



A PLUMP orthotypist named 
Lola went by and a couple of 
the men turned with automatic 
whistles. 

“Listen,” said Olaf Olsen con- 
spiratorially, with a hand on Alva- 
rez’s arm, “that reminds me, did 
you hear what happened at the 
big banquet in George’s honor 
yesterday?” 

“No,” said Alvarez, irritably 
withdrawing his arm. “I didn’t go. 
Can’t stand banquets. Why?” 

“Well, the way I got it, the 
commandant’s wife was sitting 
right across from George—” 

Alvarez’s interest sharpened. 
“You mean the gorgon? What did 
he do?” 

“I’m telling you. See, it looked 
like he was watching her all 
through dinner. Then along comes 
the dessert — lemon meringue. 
So old George — ” 

The shift bell rang. Alvarez 
started nervously and looked at 
his thumbwatch. The other men 
were drifting away. So was Olaf, 
laughing like a fool. 

“You’ll die when 5 tou hear,” he 
called back. “Boy, do I wish I’d 
been there myself! So long, 
Walt.” 

Alvarez reluctantly went the 
other way. In B Corridor, some- 
body called out to him, “Hey, 
Walt! Hear about the banquet?” 

He shook his head. The other 
man, a baker named Pedro, 
grinned and waved, disappearing 

122 



up the curve of the corridor. Al- 
varez opened the door of Xenol- 
ogy Section and went in. 

During his absence, somebody 
had put a new chart on the wall. 
It was ten feet high and there 
were little rectangles all over it, 
each connected by lines to other 
rectangles. 

When he first saw it, Alvarez 
thought it was a new table of or- 
ganization for the Satellite Serv- 
ice and he winced; but on closer 
inspection, the chart was too com- 
plex, and besides, it had a pecul- 
iar disorganized appearance. 
Boxes had been white-rubbed out 
and other boxes drawn on top of 
them. Some parts were crowded 
illegibly together and others were 
spacious. 

The whole thing looked des- 
perately confused and so did El- 
vis Womrath, who was on a 
wheeled ladder erasing the entire 
top righthand comer. 

“N panga,” he said irritably. 
“That right?” 

“Yes,” a voice piped unexpect- 
edly. Alvarez looked around, saw 
nobody. The voice went on, “But 
he is R panga to his cousins and 
all their N pangas or bigger, ex- 
cept when — ” 

Alvarez leaned over and peered 
around the desk. There on the 
carpet was the owner of the voice, 
a pinkish-white spheroid with var- 
ious appendages sprouting in all 
directions, like a floating mine: 

OALAXV SCIENCE FICTION 



“George” the gorgon. 

“Oh, it’s you,” said Alvarez, 
producing his echo sounder and 
humidometer. ‘What’s all this 
nonsense I hear—” He began to 
prod the gorgon with the test 
equipment, making his regular 
morning examination. It was the 
only bright moment of his day; 
the infirmary could wait. 

“All right,” Womrath inter- 
rupted, scrubbing furiously. “R 
panga to cousins — wait a minute 
now.” He turned with a scowl. 
“Alvarez, I’ll be through in a min- 
ute. N panga or bigger, except 
when . .” He sketched in half a 
dozen boxes, labeled them and 
began to draw connecting lines. 
“Now is that right?” he asked 
George. 

“Yes, only now it is wrong 
panga to mother’s cousins. Draw 
again from father’s cousins’ N 
pangas to mother’s cousins’ O 
pangas or bigger ... Yes, and now 
from father’s uncles’ R pangas 
to mother’s uncles’ pangas’ cous- 
ins — ” 

Tf/'OMRATH’S hand faltered. 

” He stared at the chart; he 
had drawn such a tangle of lines, 
he couldn’t tell what box con- 
nected with which. 

“Oh, God,” he said hopelessly. 
He climbed down off the ladder 
and slapped the stylus into Al- 
varez’s palm. “You go nuts.” He 
thumbed the intercom on the 



desk and said, “Chief, I’m going 
off now. Way off.” 

“Did you get that chart straight- 
ened out?” the intercom de- 
manded. 

“No, but -” 

“You’re on extra duty as of 
now. Take a pill. Is Alvarez 
here?” 

“Yes,” said Womrath resignedly. 
“Both of you come in, then. 
Leave George outside.” 

“Doctor,” the spheroid piped, 
“are you panga to me?” 

“Don’t let’s get into that,” said 
Womrath, twitching, and took Al- 
varez by the sleeve. 

They found the chief of the 
Xenology Section, Edward H. 
Dominick, huddled bald and bear- 
like behind his desk. The cigar in 
his hand looked chewed. 

“Womrath,” he said, “when can 
you give me that chart?” 

“I don’t know. Never, maybe.” 
When Dominick scowled at him 
irritably, he shrugged and lit a 
cigarette. 

Dominick swiveled his gaze at 
Alvarez. “Have you heard about 
what happened at the banquet in 
George’s honor yesterday?” 

“No, I have not,” said Alvarez. 
“Will you be so kind as to tell me, 
or else shut up about it?” 

Dominick rubbed his shaven 
skull, absorbing the insult. “It was 
during the dessert. George was 
sitting opposite Mrs. Carver, in 
that little jump seat. Just as she

123 



got her fork into the pie — it was 
lemon meringue — George rolled 
right up over the table and 
grabbed the plate away. Mrs. Car- 
ver screamed, pulled back — 
thought she was being attacked, I 
suppose — and the chair went out 
from under her. It — was — a 
— mess.” 

Alvarez ended the awed silence. 
“What did he do with the pie?” 

“Ate it,” said Dominick glumly. 
“Had a perfectly good piece of his 
own that he didn’t touch.” He 
popped a lozenge into his mouth. 

Alvarez shook his head. “Not 
typical. His pattern is strictly 
submissive. I don’t like it.” 

“That’s whaVl told Carver. But 
he was livid. Shaking. We all sat 
there until he escorted his wife to 
her room and came back. Then 
we had an interrogation. All we 
could get out of George was, ‘I 
thought I was panga to her.’” 

A LVAREZ shifted impatiently 
in his chair, reaching auto- 
matically for a bunch of grapes 
from the bowl on the desk. He 
was a small, spare man and he 
felt defensive about it. “Now what 
is all this panga business?” he 
demanded. 

Womrath snorted and began to 
peel a banana. 

“Panga,” said Dominick, “would 
appear to be some kind of com- 
plicated authority-submission re- 
lationship that exists among the 

124 



gorgons.” Alvarez sat up straight- 
en “They never mentioned it to 
us because we never asked. Now 
it turns out to be crucial.” Dom- 
inick sighed. “Fourteen months, 
just getting a three-man base 
down on the planet. Seven more 
to get the elders’ jjermission to 
bring a gorgon here experimen- 
tally. All according to the book. 
We picked the biggest and bright- 
est-looking one we could find. 
That was George. He seemed to 
be coming along great. And now 
this.” 

“Well, Chief,” said Womrath 
carefully, “nobody has any more 
admiration than I have for Mrs. 
Carver as a consumer — she really 
puts it away — but it seems to me 
the question is, is George dam- 
aged — ” 

Dominick was shaking his head. 
“I haven’t told you the rest of it. 
This panga thing stopped Carver 
cold, but not for long. He beamed 
down to the planethead and had 
Rubinson ask the elders, ‘Is 
George panga to the comman- 
dant’s wife?’” 

Alvarez grinned mirthlessly 
and clicked his tongue. 

Dominick nodded. “Who knows 
what a question like that may 
have meant to them? They an- 
swered back, in effect, ‘Certainly 
not,’ and wanted to know the de- 
tails. Carver told them.” 

“And?” asked Alvarez. 

“They said George was a shock- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing criminal who should be appro- 
priately punished. Not by them, 
you understand — by us, because 
we’re the offended parties. More- 
over— now this must make sense 
to their peculiar way of looking at 
things — if we don’t punish George 
to their satisfaction, they'll pimish 
Rubinson and his whole crew.” 
“How?” 

“By doing whatever it is we 
should have done to George — 
which could be anything.” 

Womrath pursed his lips to 
whistle, but no sound came out. 
He swallowed a mouthful of ba- 
nana and tried again. Still nothing. 

“You get it?” said Dominick 
with suppressed emotion. They all 
looked through the open doorway 
at George, squatting patiently in 
the other room. “There’s no trou- 
ble about ‘punishment’— we all 
know what it means; we’ve read 
the books. But how do you punish 
an alien like that? An eye for a 
what?” 

let’s see if we have this 
^ straight,” said Dominick, 
sorting through the pap>ers in his 
hand. Womrath and Alvarez 
looked on from either side. 
George tried to peek, too, but his 
photoceptors were too short. They 
were all standing in the outer 
office, which had been stripped to 
the bare walls and floor. “One. 
We know a gorgon changes color 
according to his emotional state. 



When the3^re contented, they’re 
a kind of rose pink. When they’re 
unhappy, they turn blue.” 

“He’s been pink ever since 
we’ve had him on the Satellite,” 
said Womrath, glancing down at 
the gorgon. 

“Except at the banquet,” Dom- 
inick answered thoughtfully. “I 
remember he turned bluish just 
before ... If we could find out 
what it was that set him off . 
Well, first things first.” He held 
down another linger. “Two, we 
don’t have any information at all 
about local systems of reward and 
punishment. They may cut each 
other into bits for spitting on the 
sidewalk, or they may just slap 
each other’s — um, wrists—” 

He looked imhappily down at 
George, whose auricles and photo- 
ceptors were all out on stalks. 

“— for arson, rape and mopery,” 
Dominick finished. “We don’t 
know. We’ll have to play it by 
ear.” 

“What does George say about 
it?” Alvarez asked. “Why don’t 
you ask him?” 

“We thought of that,” Womrath 
said glumly. “Asked him what the 
elders would do to him in a case 
like this, and he said they’d quab- 
ble his infarcts or something.” 

“A dead end,” Dominick added. 
“It would take us years . ,” He 
scrubbed his naked scalp with a 
p>alm. “Well, number three, we’ve 
got all the furniture out of here — 



AN EYE FOR A WHAT?

it’s going to be damned crowded, 
with the whole staff working in 
my office, but never mind . 
Number four, there’s his plate 
with the bread and water. And 
number five, that door has been 
fixed so it latches on the outside. 
Let’s give it a dry rtm.” 

He led the way to the door; the 
others followed, including George. 

“No, you stay in here,” Worn- 
rath told George, who stopped, 
blushing an agreeable pink. 

"TkOMINICK closed the door 
and dropped the improvised 
latch into its socket. He pimched 
the door button, foimd it satisfac- 
torily closed. Through the trans- 
parent upper pane, they could see 
George inquisitively watching. 

Dominick opened the door 
again. “Now, George, pay atten- 
tion. This is a prison. You’re be- 
ing punished. We’re going to keep 
you in here, with nothing to eat 
but what’s there, until we think 
you’re punished enough. Under- 
stand?” 

“Yes,” George said doubtfully. 

“All right,” said Dominick, and 
closed the door. 

They all stood watching for a 
while, and George stood watching 
them back, but nothing else hap- 
pened. 

“Let’s go into my office and 
wait,” said Dominick, with a sigh. 
“Can’t expect miracles all at 
once.” 

126 



They trooped down the corri- 
dor to the adjoining room and ate 
peanuts for a while. 

“He’s a sociable creature,” 
Womrath said hopefully. “He’ll 
get lonesome after a while.” 

“And himgry,” Alvarez said. 
“He never turns down a meal.” 
Half an hour later, when they 
looked in, George was thought- 
fully chewing up the carpet 
“No, no, no, no, George,” said 
Dominick, bursting in on him. 
“You’re not supp>osed to eat any- 
thing except what we give you. 
This is a prison.” 

“Good carpet” said George, 
hurt. 

“I don’t care if it is. You don’t 
eat it, understand?” 

“Okay,” said George cheerfully. 
His color was an honest rose pink. 

Four hours later, when Alvarez 
went off shift, George had settled 
down in a comer and pulled in all 
his appendages. He was asleep. If 
anything, he looked pinker than 
ever. 

When Alvarez came on shift 
again, there was no doubt about 
it. George was sitting in the mid- 
dle of the room, photoceptors out 
and waving rhsthmically; his 
color was a glowing pink, the pink 
of a rose pearl. Dominick kept 
him in there for another day, just 
to make sure; George seemed to 
lose a little weight on the austere 
diet, but glowed a steady pink. He 
liked it.

J^ELLY, the games instructor, 
tried to keep up a good front, 
but he had the worst case of 
wheel fever on SAPS 3107A. It 
had got so that looking out at that 
fat, blue-green planet, swimming 
there so close, was more than he 
could bear. 

Kelly was a big man, an out- 
doorsman by instinct; he longed 
for natural air in his lungs and 
turf under his feet. To compen- 
sate, he strode faster, shouted 
louder, got redder of face and 
bulgier of eye, bristled more 
fiercely. To quiet an occasional 
trembling of his hands, he 
munched sedative pills. He had 
dreams of falling, with which he 
bored the ship’s Mother Hubbard 
and the Church of Marx padre by 
turns. 

“Is that it?” he asked now, dis- 
approvingly. He had never seen 
the gorgon before; Semantics, 
Medical and Xenology Sections 
had been keeping the alien pretty 
much to themselves. 

Dominick prodded the i>inkish 
sphere with his toe. “Wake up, 
George.” 

After a moment, the gorgon’s 
skin became lumpy at half a 
dozen points. The lumps grew 
slowly into long, segmented stems. 
Some of these expanded at the 
tips into “feet” and “hands.” 
Others flowered into the intricate 



patterns of auricles and photocep- 
tors — and one speech-organ, 
which looked like a small trumpet 
“Hello,” said George sunnily. 
“He can pull them back in any 
time?” Kelly asked, rubbing his 
chin. 

“Yes. Show him, George.” 

The feathery stalks obligingly 
became blank-tipped, then rap- 
idly shrank, segment by segment. 
In less than two seconds, George 
was a smooth sphere again. 

“Well, that makes for a little 
problem here,” said Kelly. “You 
see what I mean? If you can’t get 
a grip on him, how are you going 
to punish him like you say?” 
“We’ve tried everything we 
could think of,” said Dominick. 
“We locked him up, kept him on 
short rations, didn’t talk to him . 
He doesn’t draw any pay, of 
course, so we can’t fine him.” 

“Or downgrade him on the pro- 
motion lists, either,” said Worn- 
rath gloomily. 

“No. And it’s a little late to use 
the Pavlov-Morganstem treat- 
ments we all had when we were 
children. We can’t prevent a crime 
he’s already committed. So our 
thought was, since you’re the 
games instructor—” 

“We thought,” Womrath said 
diplomatically, “you might have 
noticed something that might be 
useful. You know, rough-housing 
and so on.” 

Kelly thought this over. “Well,

there’s low blows,” he said, “but 
I mean, hell—” He gestured fu- 
tilely at George, who had just de- 
cided to put his auricles out again. 
“What would you — ?” 

“No, that’s out of the question,” 
Dominick said heavily. “Well, I’m 
sorry, Kelly. It was nice of you 
to help out.” 

“Wait a minute,” said Kelly. “I 
got something coming to me, 
maybe.” He nibbled a thumbnail, 
staring down at the gorgon. “How 
would this be? I was thinking — 
sometimes the boys in the pool, 
they get kind of frisky; they take 
to ducking each other. Under the 
water. Now what I was thinking, 
he breathes air, doesn’t he? You 
know what I mean?” 

T^OMINICK and Alvarez 
looked at each other. “It 
sounds jxjssible,” said Dominick. 

“Out of the question,” Alvarez 
objected. “We don’t know what 
his tolerance is. Suppose Kelly 
should damage him severely or 
even—” 

“Oh,” said Dominick. “Yes, 
you’re right. We couldn’t take a 
chance.” 

“I’ve been a games instructor 
for seventy-three years— two re- 
juvenations—” Kelly began, bris- 
tling. 

“It isn’t that, Kelly,” said Worn- 
rath hastily. “George isn’t human, 
so how do we know how he’d re- 
act to a ducking?” 



“On the other hand,” Dominick 
said, “gorgons do turn blue when 
they’re not happy — we have Ru- 
binson’s assurance for that. It 
seems to me George wouldn’t be 
happy when smothering; that 
would be the whole point, wouldn’t 
it? Dr. Alvarez would supervise 
closely, of course. Really, Alvarez, 
I don’t see why not. Kelly, if 
you’ll tell us what time would be 
most convenient for you—” 

“Well,” said Kelly, looking at 
his thumbwatch, “hell, the pool is 
empty now. It’s ladies’ day, but 
all the girls are down in Section 
Seven, hanging around Mrs. Car- 
ver. I hear she’s still hysterical.” 
Struck by a thought, Alvarez 
was bending over to speak to the 
gorgon. “George, you breathe by 
spiracles, is that correct? Those 
little tubes all over your skin?” 
“Yes,” said George. 

“Well, do they work under 
water?” 

“No.” 

Dominick and Kelly were lis- 
tening with interest. 

“If we held you imder water, 
would it hurt you?” 

George flickered xmcertainly, 
from rose to pale magenta. “Don’t 
know. Never tried.” 

The three men leaned closer. 
“Well, George,” said Alvarez, 
tensely, “would that be a punish- 
ment?” 

George flickered violently. 
“Yes. No. Maybe. Don’t know.”

They straightened again, disap- 
pointed. Dominick sighed gustily. 
“He always gives us those mixed- 
up answers. I don’t know. Let’s 
try it. What else can we do?” 

I^ELLY found himself paired 
off with George, following 
Dominick and Dr. Alvarez, and 
preceding Womrath and an or- 
derly named Josling who was 
wheeling one of the dispensary 
pulmotors. The up-curving corri- 
dors were deserted. Kelly lagged 
a little, adjusting his pace to 
George’s waddling steps. After a 
moment, he was surprised to feel 
something small and soft grip his 
fingers. He looked down; George 
the gorgon had put one seven- 
fingered “hand” into his. The gor- 
gon’s flowerlike photoceptors were 
turned trustfully upward. 

Kelly was taken by surprise. 
No children were allowed on the 
Satellite, but Kelly had been the 
father of eight in a previous reju- 
venation. The confiding touch 
stirred old memories. 

“You’ll be all right,” said Kelly 
gruffly. “You just come along with 
me. 

The pool, as he had predicted, 
was empty. Ripples reflected faint 
threads of light up and down 
along the walls. 

“The shallow end would be bet- 
ter,” said Kelly. His voice was 
hollow and echoed back flatly. 
Pausing to peel off his coverall. 



he led George carefully down the 
steps into the pool. Half sub- 
merged, George floated. Kelly 
drew him gently out into deeper 
water. 

Dominick and the others ar- 
ranged themselves along the brink 
in interested attitudes. 

Kelly cleared his throat. “The 
way it generally happens, one of 
the boys will grab ahold of an- 
other one, like this—” He put his 
hands on the smooth floating 
globe, and hesitated. 

“Go ahead, Kelly,” called Dom- 
inick. “Remember, you have a di- 
rect order to do this.” 

“Sure,” said Kelly. He turned 
to the gorgon. “Hold your breath 
now!” He pressed downward. The 
gorgon seemed lighter than he 
had expected, like an inflated 
ball; it was hard to force it under. 

Kelly pushed harder. George 
went under briefly and slipped 
out of Kelly’s hands, bobbing to 
the surface. The gorgon’s speak- 
ing trumpet cleared itself of water 
with a phonk and said, “Nice. Do 
again, Kelly.” 

Kelly glanced over at Dom- 
inick, who said, “Yes. Again.” Dr. 
Alvarez stroked his thin beard 
and said nothing. 

Kelly took a deep sympathetic 
breath and shoved the gorgon im- 
der. A few bubbles came to the 
surface. George’s speaking trum- 
pet broke water, but made no 
sound. Down below, Kelly could

see his own pale hands grip>ping 
the gorgon’s body; the water 
made them look bloodless; but 
not George — he was a clear, un- 
blemished pink. 

^ I ■’ HERE was a discouraged si- 
lence when Kelly brought him 
back up. 

“Listen,” said Womrath, “I’ve 
got another idea. George, can you 
breathe through that speaking 
trumpet, too?” 

“Yes,” said George cheerfully. 

Everybody brightened percep- 
tibly. Josling polished his pulmo- 
tor with a rag. 

“Go ahead, Kelly,” said Dom- 
inick. “And this time, you hold 
him under.” 

George went down for the third 
time. The bubbles swirled up- 
ward. The gorgon’s speaking trum- 
pet swayed toward the surface, 
but Kelly leaned farther over, 
blocking it with his forearm. After 
a moment, all of George’s appen- 
dages began to contract. Kelly 
craned his neck downward anx- 
iously. Was a hint of blue begin- 
ning to show? 

“Keep him down,” called Alva- 
rez sharply. 

George was a blank sphere 
again. Then one or two of the 
limbs began to reappear, but they 
looked different somehow. 

“Now?” asked Kelly. 

“Give him a second more,” said 
Dominick, leaning over precari- 




ously, “It seems to me — ” 

Kell3^s back muscles were 
knotted with tension. He did not 
like the way George’s new limbs 
seemed to be flattening out, trail- 
ing limpy. It was as if something 
had gone wrong in the works. 

“I’m bringing him up,” he said 
hoarsely. 

To Kelly’s horror, when he 
lifted his hands, George stayed 
where he was. Kelly made a grab 



130 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




for him, but the gorgon slipped 
out from under his fingers. The 
new limbs stiffened and sculled 
vigorously; George darted away, 
deep under the water. 

Leaning, open-mouthed, Dom- 
inick slipped and went into the 
pool with a majestic splash. He 
fioimdered and rose up, a mo- 
ment later, streaming with water 
like a sea lion. Kelly, wading anx- 
iously toward him, stopped when 



he saw that Dominick was safe. 
Both men looked down. Between 
them and around them swam 
George, darting and drifting by 
turns, as much at home in the 
pool as a speckled trout. 

“Fins!” said Dominick, slack- 
jawed. “And gills!” 

TT MAY as well be said that 
Dr. Walter Alvarez was a mis- 
anthrope. He did not like people; 



AN EYE FOR A WHAT? 



131 



he liked diseases. Down there on 
Planet Seven, once the trade mis- 
sion was established, he could 
confidently expect enough new 
and startling ailments to keep 
him happy for years. 

Up here, all he got were 
sprained ankles, psychosomatic 
colds, hives and indigestion. 
There was one cook’s helper 
named Samuels who kept coming 
back every Wednesday with the 
same boil on the back of his neck. 
It got so that in spite of himself, 
Alvarez spent the whole week 
dreading Wednesday. When he 
saw Samuels’ earnest face coming 
through the door, something 
seemed to wind itself a little 
tighter inside him. 

Some day, when Samuels 
opened his mouth to say, “Hey, 
Doc — ” Samuels always called 
him “Doc”— the something inside 
him was going to break with a 
sound like a bail jo string. What 
would happen then, Dr. Alvarez 
was unable to imagine. 

When the gorgon had first been 
brought up to the Satellite, there 
had been two or three delightful 
little fungus infections, then 
nothing. A great disappointment. 
Alvarez had isolated and cultured 
almost a hundred microorganisms 
found in smears he had taken 
from George, but they were all 
non-viable in human tissue. The 
viable bacteria, viruses, parasites 
that always turned up on a life- 

132 



infested planet were evidently 
lurking in some organism other 
than the gorgons. They swam, at 
night, across the optical field of 
Dr. Alvarez’s dreaming mind — 
rod-shaped ones, lens-shaped ones, 
wriggly ones, leggy ones and ones 
with teeth. 

One morning. Dr. Alvarez 
awoke with a desperate resolve. 
It was a Tuesday. He went di- 
rectly to the infirmary, relieved 
Nurse Trumble who was on duty, 
and, opening a locked cabinet, 
filled a hypodermic from an am- 
pule of clear straw-colored fluid. 
The trade name of this substance 
was bets-off; it was a coimter- 
inhibitant which stunned the cen- 
sor areas of the forebrain chiefly 
affected by the Pavlov-Morgan- 
stem treatments. (By an odd co- 
incidence, the patentee was a Dr. 
Jekyll.) Alvarez injected two c.c.s 
of it directly into the median ba- 
silic vein and sat down to wait. 

A FTER a few minutes, his per- 
petual bad humor began to 
lift. He felt a pleasant ebullience; 
the colors of things aroimd him 
seemed brighter and clearer. 

“Ha!” said Alvarez. 

He got up and went to his little 
refrigerator, where, after some 
search, he found half a dozen of 
the cultures he had made of mi- 
croorganisms taken from gorgon 
smears. They were quiescent, of 
course — deep-frozen. Alvarez 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wanned them cautiously and add- 
ed nutrients. All .morning, while 
the usual succession of minor 
complaints paraded through the 
infirmary, the cultures grew and 
multiplied. Alvarez was jovial 
with his patients; he cracked a 
joke or two and handed out harm- 
less pills all around. 

By noon, four of the cultures 
were flourishing. Alvarez carefully 
concentrated them into one and 
loaded another hypodermic with 
the resulting brew. To his liber- 
ated intelligence, the matter was 
clear: No organism, man or pig 
or gorgon, was altogether immune 
to the microbes it normally car- 
ried in its body. Up>set the bal- 
ance by injecting massive colonies 
of any one of them and you were 
going to have a sick gorgon — i.e., 
Alvarez thought, a punished gor- 
gon. 

The treatment might also kill 
the patient, but Alvarez light- 
heartedly dismissed this argument 
as a quibble. (Or quabble?) 
Armed with his hypo, he went 
forth looking for George. 

He found him in the small as- 
sembly room, together with Dom- 
inick, Womrath and a mechanic 
named Bob Ritner. They were all 
standing aroimd a curious instru- 
ment, or object of art, built out of 
bar aluminum. 

“It’s a rack,” Ritner explained 
proudly. “I saw a picture of it 
once in a kids’ book.” 



The main feature of the “rack” 
was a long, narrow table with a 
windlass at one end. It looked like 
a crude device for stretching 
something. 

“We thought the time had 
come for stem measures,” Dom- 
inick said, mopping his head. 

“In the olden days,” Ritner put 
in, “they used these on prisoners 
who wouldn’t talk.” 

“I talk,” George pleasantly of- 
fered. 

“It’s another punishment, 
George,” Dominick explained 
kindly. “Well, Alvarez, before we 
go ahead, I suppose you want to 
examine your patient.” 

“Yes, just so, ha-ha!” said Al- 
varez. 

XX E KNELT down and peered 
keenly at George, who swiv- 
eled his photoceptors interestedly 
around to stare back. The doctor 
prodded George’s hide; it was 
firm and resilient. The gorgon’s 
color was a clear pink and the in- 
tricate folds of his auricles seemed 
crisp and alert. 

Alvarez took a hand scale from 
his kit; it was pre-set for A Level 
gravity. “Climb up here, George.” 
Obediently, the gorgon settled 
himself on the pan of the scale 
while Alvarez held it up. 

“Hm,” said Alvarez. “He’s lost 
a good deal of weight.” 

“He has?” asked Dominick 
hopefully. 



AN EYE FOR A WHAT? 



133 



he seems to be in unusu- 
ally good condition — better than 
a week ago, I would say. Perhaps 
just a little sugar solution to pep 
him up—” Alvarez withdrew the 
hypo from his kit, aimed it at 
George’s smooth skin and pressed 
the trigger. 

Dominick sighed. “Well, I sup- 
pose we might as well go ahead. 
George, just hop up there and let 
Ritner tie those straps onto yoiL” 

George trustingly climbed onto 
the table. Ritner buckled straps 
around four of his limbs and then 
began to tighten the cylinder. 

“Not too much,” said George 
anxiously. 

“I’ll be careful,” Ritner assured 
him. He kept on winding the cyl- 
inder up. “How does that feel?” 

George’s “arms” and “legs” were 
half again their usual length and 
still stretching. 

“Tickles,” giggled George. 

Ritner went on turning the han- 
dle. Sims coughed nervously and 
was shushed. George’s limbs kept 
on getting longer; then his body 
started to lengthen visibly. 

“Are you all right, George?” 
Dominick asked. 

“Very fine.” 

Ritner gave the handle a last 
despairing twist. George’s elon- 
gated body stretched all the way 
in comfort from one end of the 
rack to the other. There was no 
place else for him to go. 

“Nice,” said George. “Do again.” 



He was glowing a happy pink. 

Ritner frustratedly kicked his 
machine. Alvarez snorted and 
went away. In the corridor, un- 
seen, he jumped up and clicked 
his heels together. He was having 
a wonderful time; his only regret 
was that it was not tomorrow. 
Come to think of it, why wait till 
Wednesday? 

C OMMANDANT Charles Wat- 
son Carver, S. S., had been 
trained to make quick and coura- 
geous decisions. Once you began 
to entertain a doubt of your own 
rightness, you would hesitate too 
much, begin to second-guess your- 
self, fall prey to worry and anxi- 
ety, and end up without any 
p>ower of decision at all. 

The trouble was, you could 
never be right all the time. Fol- 
lowing the book to the letter, or 
improvising brilliantly, either way 
you were bound to make mis- 
takes. The thing was to cross 
them off and go ahead just the 
same. 

Carver firmed his chin and 
straightened his back, looking 
down at the gorgon. It was sick, 
all right, there was no question 
about that. The thing’s limbs 
drooped and weaved slightly, diz- 
zily. Its hide was dry and hot to 
the touch. 

“How long has he been like 
this?” Carver demanded, hesitat- 
ing only slightly over the “he.” 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Aliens were “it” to him and al- 
ways had been, but it didn’t do 
to let anybody know that. 

“Twenty minutes, more or less,” 
said Dr. Nasalroad. “I just got 
here myself—” he stifled a yawn 
— “about ten or fifteen minutes 
ago.” 

“What are you doing here, any- 
way?” Carver asked him. “It’s Al- 
varez’s shift.” 

Nasalroad looked embarrassed. 
“I know. Alvarez is in the hospital 
as a patient. He assaulted a cook’s 
helper named Samuels — poured 
soup over his head. He was shout- 
ing something about boiling the 
boil on Samuels’ neck. We had 
to put him under sedation. It took 
three of us.” 

^ARVER set his jaw hard. 
^ “Nasalroad, what is hapjjen- 
ing on this wheel, anyhow? First 
this thing attacks my wife. Then 
Alvarez — ” He glared down at 
George. “Can you pull him out of 
this, whatever it is?” 

Nasalroad looked surprised. 
“That would be a large order. We 
don’t know any gorgon medicine. 
I was assuming you’d want to 
beam down and ask them.” 

That was reasonable, of course. 
The only hitch was, as usual, a 
matter of interpretation. Was this 
something they had negligently 
allowed to happen to an impor- 
tant alien representative, or was 
it the necessary and proper pun- 



ishment they had all been looking 
for? 

He asked Nasalroad, “What 
color would you say he is now? 
Not pink, certainly.” 

“No-o. But not blue, either. I’d 
call it a kind of violet.” 

“Hm. Well, anyhow, he’s got 
smaller than he was, isn’t that 
right? Conspicuously smaller.” 
Nasalroad admitted it. 

Carver made his decision. “Do 
the best you can,” he said to 
Nasalroad. He lifted his wristcom, 
said briskly, “Have you got a line- 
of-sight to the planethead?” 

“Yes, sir,” the operator an- 
swered. 

“All right, get me Rubinson.” 

A few seconds passed. “Planet- 
head.” 

“Rubinson, this is Carver. Tell 
the elders we’ve got a pretty im- 
happy gorgon here. We’re not 
sure just what did it — might have 
been one of a lot of things — but 
he’s lost a good deal of weight, 
and his color—” Carver hesitated 
— “it’s bluish. Definitely bluish. 
Got that?” 

“Yes, Chief. Thank goodness! 
I’ll pass the message along right 
away and call you back.” 

“Right.” Carver closed the 
wristcom with an assertive snap. 
The gorgon, when he glanced 
down at it, looked sicker than 
ever, but no matter. What hap- 
pened to the gorgon was its look- 
out; Carver was doing his duty. 



AN EYE FOR A WHAT? 



135 



Ill 



A LVAREZ awoke with a hor- 
rible headache and a sense of 
guilt. He was not in his own cu- 
bicle, but in one of the hospital 
bunks, dressed in a regulation set 
of hospital pajamas (with remov- 
able hood and gloves, capable of 
being converted into a spacesuit). 
He could just see the wall clock 
at the far end of the room. It was 
twenty-three hours — well into his 
shift. 

Alvarez scuttled out of bed, 
groaning, and looked at the chart 
beside it. Mania, delusions. Seda- 
tion. Signed, Nasalroad. 

Delusions: yes, he was having 
one now. He imagined he could 
remember heaving up a big tu- 
reen of mock-turtle soup over 
Samuels’ startled face — splash, a 
smoking green torrent. 

Good heavens! If that was real 
— Samuels! 

And the gorgon! 

Groaning and lurching, Alvarez 
darted out of the room, past the 
orderly. Munch, who was sitting 
with a story viewer on his lap 
and couldn’t get up fast enough. 
“Dr. Alvarez! Dr. Nasalroad 
said — ” 

“Never mind Nasalroad,” Alva- 
rez snapped, pawing in the re- 
frigerator. He remembered those 
cultures being right back here; 
but now they were gone. 

“—not to let you up until you 



acted normal again. Uh, how do 
you feel. Doctor?” 

“I feel fine! What difference 
does that make? How is he?” 
Munch looked puzzled and ap- 
prehensive. “Samuels? Just super- 
ficial burns. We put him to bed 
in his own cubby, because — ” 
“Not Samuels!” Alvarez grabbed 
Munch by the front of his suit. 
“The gorgon!” 

“Oh, well, he’s been sick, too. 
How did you know, though. Doc- 
tor? You were snoring when it 
happened. Listen, let go my suit; 
you’re making me nervous.” 
“Where?” Alvarez demanded, 
thrusting his scrawny face close 
to the other’s. 

“Where what? Oh, you mean 
the gorgon? Up in the little as- 
sembly room, the last I — ” 

Alvarez was gone, out the door 
and down the corridor like a 
small, bearded fireball. He found 
an anxious crowd assembled — 
Commandant and Mrs. Carver, 
Dominick and his staff. Urban 
and two assistants from Seman- 
tics, orderlies, porters, and Dr. 
Nasalroad. Nasalroad had the 
gaunt and bright-eyed appearance 
of a man who has been on wake- 
up pills too long. He started when 
he saw Alvarez. 

“What’s up?” Alvarez de- 
manded, grabbing his sleeve. 
“Where’s the gorgon? What—” 
“Be quiet,” said Nasalroad. 
“George is over in that comer be-

hind Carver. We’re waiting for 
the delegation from planetside. 
Rubinson said they were coming 
up, three of them with some kind 
of a box.” 

' I ’ HE loudspeaker said sud- 
denly, “I have the tender 
locked on. Contact. Contact is 
made. The lock is opening; get 
ready, here they come.” 

Alvarez couldn’t see past Car- 
ver’s bulk. He tried to get away, 
but Nasalroad stopped him. “I 
want to see,” he said irritably. 

“Listen,” Nasalroad said. “I 
know what you did. I checked the 
bets-off pills and those cultures 
against inventory. The gorgon 
seems to be recovering nicely, no 
thanks to you. Now has the stuff 
worn off you or not? Because if 
not-” 

A rustle went over the group. 
Alvarez and Nasalroad turned in 
time to see the door opening. Two 
vigorous-looking gorgons waddled 
through; they were carrying an 
enameled metal box between 
them. 

“Foop!” said the first one ex- 
perimentally. “Where is gorgon 
George?” 

“I’m all right,” Alvarez mut- 
tered. “If I wasn’t, I’d have done 
something uncivilized to you by 
now, wouldn’t I?” 

“I guess so,” said Nasalroad. 
They elbowed closer as the group 
shifted, making a space around 



the three gorgons. Peering, on 
tiptoe, Alvarez could see George 
standing shakily beside the other 
two. “He looks terrible. Those 
are big ones, those other two, 
aren’t they?” 

“Not as big as George was 
when we got him,” Nasalroad 
muttered. “Walt, if it turns out 
you’ve ruined the whole thing. I’ll 
take a dose of bets-off myself 
and — ” 

“Listen!” snarled Alvarez. 

One of the gorgons was ex- 
plaining, “This is panga box. 
What you call? You know panga?” 

‘Well, uh, yes and no,” said 
Dominick uncomfortably. “But 
what about the punishment? We 
understood — ” 

“Punishment later. You, George, 
go in box.” 

Obediently, George waddled 
over and squatted beside the 
mouth of the box. He bobbed 
uncertainly; he looked for all the 
world like a large woman trying 
to get into a small sports ’copter. 
There was a minor outbreak of 
nervous laughter, quickly sup- 
pressed. 

George leaned, retracting most 
of his upper appendages. His 
round body began to be com- 
pressed into a squarish shape, 
wedging itself into the box. 

The other gorgons watched 
with an air of tension, photo- 
ceptors rigidly extended. A hush 
fell. Among the humans present. 



AN EYE FOR A WHAT? 



137 



there was a general air of Why- 
are-we-all-whispering? 

George wriggled and oozed far- 
ther into the box. Momentarily, 
he stuck. He flickered blue, then 
pink. His “feet,” almost retracted, 
scrabbled feebly at the bottom of 
the box. 

Then he was in. 

of the other gorgons sol- 
emnly closed the lid on 
George and fastened it to make 
sure, then opened it again and 



helped him out. All three gorgons 
began to make rhythmic swaying 
motions with their “arms” and 
other appendages. George, Alva- 
rez thought, looked smug. He felt 
a sudden premonitory pang. 
What had he done? 

“What’s it all about?” Hasal* 
road demanded. “Are they meas- 
uring him for a coflin or—” 

Dominick, overhearing, turned 
and said, “I don’t think so. Now 
this is interesting. You remember 
they said a panga box. What Fm 




138 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



afraid of is that they may have a 
standard of size. You see what I 
mean? They could be measuring 
George to see if he falls below the 
minimum standard of — uh — 
panga relations.” 

“Oh, heavens,” said another 
voice. It was Urban of Semantics, 
who had been neglected of late; 
they hadn’t needed him since 
George learned English. He was 
peering over Dominick’s shoulder, 
looking dumbfoimded. He said, 
“But don’t you know the word 




we’ve been translating ‘elders’ 
really means ‘smallest ones’? Good 
heavens — ” 

“I don’t see—” Dominick be- 
gan, but the commandant’s voice 
drowned him out. 

“Quiet! Quiet, please!” Carver 
was trumpeting. He went on, “Our 
friends from Seven have an an- 
noimcement to make. Now, then.” 
To everyone’s surprise, it was 
George who spoke, in the lisping 
adcents of the gorgon language. 
No human present understood a 
word of it except Urban, who 
turned pale and began stammer- 
ing inaudibly to himself. 

One of the gorgons began to 
speak when George stopped: 
“Most elder person, known to you 
by name George, wishes me to 
thank you all for kindness done 
him when he was humble youth.” 
“Youth,” muttered Urban. “But 
it really means ‘ungainly one’— or 
‘fat boy.’ Oh, my heavens/" 

“Now that he has become elder, 
it will be his most pleasure to re- 
pay all kindness in agreeable leg- 
islative manner.” 

“What does that mean?” Alva- 
rez queried aggrievedly. “Why 
can’t he talk for himself, any- 
way?” 

“It would be beneath his dig- 
ity now,” said Nasalroad. “Hush!” 
said the gorgon, “you 
will succeed in giving elder per- 
son, known by name George, 
proper punishment as aforesaid.”

66^^ HIS meeting will come to 
order!” said Carver, bang- 
ing on the table. George and the 
other two gorgons were sitting op- 
posite him, with the centerpiece 
of nasturtixims and ferns between 
them. Grouped around Carver 
were Dominick, Urban, Womrath, 
Alvarez, Nasalroad, Kelly and 
Ritner. 

“Now this is the situation,” Car- 
ver said aggressively. “This gor- 
gon turns out to be a member of 
their ruling council. I don’t un- 
derstand why, but forget that 
now — the point is he’s friendly 
disposed toward us, so we’ve suc- 
ceeded in this mission if we can 
find that proper punishment. 
Otherwise we’re in the soup. Sug- 
gestions.” 

Dominick craned his bald head 
toward Alvarez across the table. 
“Doctor, I had a thought. Would 
you say — is there anything pecul- 
iar about the gorgon’s body con- 
stitution as compared, say, to 
ours?” 

“Certainly ,”said Alvarez dourly. 
“Any number of things. You name 
it, they 

Giving them a dirty look. Car- 
ver nodded to Ritner. “Yes?” 

“Well, I was thinking. I know 
the rack was a washout, but there 
was another thing they used to 
use called the Iron Virgin. It had 
a door, like, with spikes on it — ” 

“What I had in mind,” Dom- 
inick said, “is there anything that 

140 



would tend to limit their body 
size — any danger or disadvantage 
in growing large?” 

Alvarez frowned and looked at 
Nasalroad, who hitched his chair 
closer. 

“The pressure?” said Nasalroad 
tentatively. They rubbed their 
chins and looked at each other 
with professional glints in their 
eyes. 

“What about the pressure?” 
Dominick prompted eagerly. 

“How long would it take you 
to build a thing like that?” Car- 
ver was asking Ritner. 

“Well — ten, eleven hours.” 
“Too long. That’s out. Next!” 
“They’re actually a single cell 
— all colloidal fluid, at a consider- 
able osmotic pressure. The bigger 
they get, the more pressure it 
takes to keep that shape. If they 
got too big, I rather imagine — ” 
Alvarez snapped his fingers, 
awed. “They’d burst!” 

Carver turned with an indig- 
nant glare. “Gentlemen, if I could 
get a little cooperation out of you, 
instead of this continual distrac- 
tion — All right, Womrath?” 

“Sir, I was just wondering, sup- 
pose if we let him turn into a 
fish, the way he did before in the 
pool — but then we’d net him and 
take him out of the water fast. 
That way, maybe — ” 

“It wouldn’t work,” said Kelly. 
“He changed back in about a sec- 
ond, the other time.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I^OBODY was paying any at- 

' tention to Kelly. One of the 
big gorgons, who had been staring 
fixedly at the flowers in the mid- 
dle of the table, had suddenly 
grabbed a handful and was stuff- 
ing them into his mouth. George 
said something shrill in gorgon 
talk and snatched the flowers 
away again. The other gorgon 
looked abashed, but flushed pink. 

George, on the other hand, was 
distinctly blue. 

His “hand,” clutching the man- 
gled flowers, hesitated. Slowly, as 
if with an effort, he put them 
back in the bowl. 

The other two gorgons twined 
their “arms” around him. After 
a moment, Goorge looked more 
his old self, but a hint of blue 
remained. 

“What is it?” asked Carver 
alertly. “Did we do something, 
finally?” 

“Did you turn blue because we 
punished you, George?” Worn- 
rath questioned. 

“No,” said George unexpect- 
edly. “Hard for me to be elder.” 
He added a few words in his own 
language to the other gorgons and 
their “arms” twined around him 
again. “Before, they panga to 
me,” he added. 

“Then that’s why he took the 
pie away from the commandant’s 
wife!” said Dominick, smiting 
himself on the forehead. 

“Of course. They—” 



“What’s that? What’s that?” 
Carver turned, bristling. 

“Why, this explains that pie 
business,” said Dominick. “He felt 
protective toward your wife, you 
see. That’s what ‘panga’ means. 
They none of them have much 
control over their own appetites, 
so they guard each other. As they 
grow older and get more self-con- 
trol, they’re expected to get 
smaller, not bigger. George felt 
confused about his panga rela- 
tionships to us, but in your wife’s 
case, he was positive one more 
mouthful would make her ex- 
plode — ” 

Carver was red to the ears. 
“Nonsense!” he shouted. “Dom- 
inick, you’re being insulting, in- 
subordinate and impatriotic!” 

George, looking on interestedly, 
piped a few words in the gorgon 
language. One of the other gor- 
gons immediately spoke up: “El- 
der person says you with smooth 
head are a smart man. He says 
the other big one who talks too 
much is wrong.” 

^ARVER’S jaws worked. He 
looked at the gorgons, then 
around the table. No one said 
anything. 

Carver set his jaw heroically. 
“Well, gentlemen, we certainly 
tried, but—” 

“Wait a minute!” said Alvarez. 
Somewhere in his narrow skull, a 
great light had dawned. “George, 



AN EYE FOR A WHAT? 



141 



am I panga to you?” 

George’s auricles waved tensely. 
“Yes. You very small man.” 
“Good.” Alvarez dry-washed his 
bony hands. “And you still have 
to be punished for that mistake 
you made at the banquet?” 
George’s speaking tube buzzed 
imhappily, “Yes.” 

“All right,” said Alvarez. Every- 
body was looking at him with ex- 
pressions varying from puzzle- 
ment to alarm. Alvarez took a 
deep breath. “Then here are my 
orders to you. Do as you please!” 
There was a hiss of indrawn 
breath from Urban. Most of the 
others looked at Alvarez as if he 
had grown snakes for hair. 

“Doctor,” said Carver, “have 
you gone off your—” 

The chorus of gasps stopped 
him. Up on the table, flushing 
blue and bright pink by turns like 
a skysign, George was gobbling up 
the flowers in the centerpiece. 
Next he ate the bowl. One of his 
flailing limbs raked in the scratch- 
pad Urban had been doodling 
on. He ate that. 

Next moment, he was leaping 
to the floor, making Ritner duck 
wildly as he passed. Part of Dom- 
inick’s detachable hood went with 
him, disappearing with hoarse 
munching sounds. With a gulp, 
George swallowed it and began 
on the carpet. He was eating 
greedily, frantically. The other 
two gorgons hovered around him 



with shrill gorgon cries, but he 
ate on, oblivious. Now he was 
bright blue and bulging, but still 
he ate. 

“Stop it!” shouted Alvarez. 
“George, stop that!” 

George rocked to a halt Grad- 
ually his blueness faded. The 
other gorgons were prodding and 
patting him anxiously. George 
looked all right, but it was obvi- 
ous as he stood there that he 
would never fit into the panga 
box again. 

He was bigger than the other 
two. 

“Alvarez,” said Carver wildly, 
“why did you—” 

“He was going to burst,” said 
Alvarez, twitching with excite- 
ment. “Couldn’t you tell? Another 
mouthful or two—” 

Carver recovered himself. He 
straightened his coverall and 
thrust out his chin. “At any rate, 
he was certainly blue that time. 
You all saw it — isn’t that right?” 
He looked around triumphantly. 
“So, unless I’m very much mis- 
taken — ” 

NE of the two attendant gor- 
gons raised his photoceptors. 
It was hard to tell which was 
George, now, except that his color 
was still a little lavender. The 
other gorgon spoke two brief sen- 
tences in his own language and 
then all three of them waddled 
off together toward the exit.

“What was that? What did he 
say?” demanded Carver. 

U RBAN cleared his throat; he 
had turned pale again. “He 
said get the tender ready to take 
them back home.” 

“The tender is there,” said 
Carver indignantly. “They can go 
back any time they want. But 
what did he say about the pun- 
ishment?” 

Urban cleared his throat again, 
looking bemused. “They say the 
punishment is good. More severe 
than any they ever thought of in 
twenty thousand years. They say 
they won’t have to pimish Rubin- 
son and the others now, because 
you have done all the punish- 
ment necessary.” 

“Well?” challenged Carver. 
“Why are you looking that way? 
What’s the hitch? Are they going 
to refuse to enter the Union, in 
spite of all this?” 

“No,” said Urban. “They say 
we are all p>anga to them now. 
The}^’!! do as we say — let us land 
and build the distribution centers, 
start them consuming in massive 
quantity.” 

“But that’ll destroy them!” 
someone interjected in a horrified 
tone. 

“That’s right,” said Urban. 
Carver sighed. He had been in 



the SAPS service most of his life 
and was proud of his record. He 
played it as a game; the new, vir- 
gin planets were the prizes and 
he kept score with the row of tiny 
iridium buttons on his breast 
pocket. He said into his wrist- 
corn, “Let me know when Rubin- 
son and his crew are on the way 
up.” 

There was a long wait. The si- 
lence grew oppressive. At length, 
the wall screen lighted with a 
view of Planet Seven, gilded 
along one cusp, blue-green and 
mysterious in the shadow. A sil- 
ver spark was floating up out of 
the night side. 

“Here they come now,” said 
the voice. 

Carver sighed again. “When 
they make contact, secure the 
tender and then signal for accel- 
eration stations. We’re leaving 
Seven. Tell Mr. Fruman to set a 
first approximation for our next 
star of call.” 

Alvarez, twitching and frown- 
ing, clutched at the front of his 
coverall. “You’re letting them go? 
Not landing on Seven — after all 
this work?” 

Carver was staring into the 
view plate. “Some beings,” he said 
slowly and unwillingly, “are not 
meant to be consumers.”
