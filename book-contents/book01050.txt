DANGER IN THE AIR 



O N THE morning of June 14, 
1959, a low moved up from 
the south and settled over New 
York like a gigantic gray hen 
with a vast knobby egg to hatch. 
The city moved in its sleep, rest- 
less under the hot, heavy vapor- 
ous pinions. 

At the Battery weather sta- 
tion, Dr. Walter Hambro found 
himself and his night assistant, 
Justin Kent, pulling for breath. 

“I knew the south was eager 
to get rid of this stinker,” com- 
plained Kent, “but they didn’t 
have to unload it on us.” 

Dr. Hambro nodded uncom- 
fortably. “It can’t stay around 
long — that nice high developing 
over Springfield, Mass., dragged 
it up here, so they’ll be the vic- 
tims next.” 

They checked the charts. That 
nice high over Springfield had 
come down from the clouds. 

“There must be another around 
somewhere,” Dr. Hambro said, 
and searched for one. 

From one coast to the other 
and from the Gulf to the border, 
the atmosphere was as relaxed 
as if it had been filled with 
Equanil. The single promising 
spot was in Canada, heading 
toward Greenland. It couldn’t 
have been drawn south even if 
every vacuum cleaner in the state 



stood bag to bag and inhaled all 
at once. 

“We’re stuck,” said Dr. Hambro. 
“This is the low that came to 
dinner.” 

Factories in and around the 
city stoked up for the day’s pro- 
duction. Sam Williams, chief fire- 
man for Lipp Novelties, summed 
up his colleagues’ problems in 
his report to Arnold Lloyd, v-p 
in charge of manufacturing: “The 
coal just lays there and smokes 
like it was tobacco in a pipe some- 
body was too lazy to clean. No 
updraft worth a damn.” 

This fact was also noted by 
Sven Hansen, janitor for the Flat- 
bush Arms. Fumes overcame him 
before he could make his report 
to anyone. His dog, Loki, gave 
warning, but against a rescue 
party of milkman, doorman and 
garbage collector, whom he held 
at bay until lured out of the way 
with a bone from the garbage 
truck. 

At the airports on the out- 
skirts of the city, the ceiling was 
low, but not low enough to im- 
pede traffic. After a number of 
takeoffs, however, all fields were 
blanketed by exhaust fumes, 
which sullenly refused to move 
away. Visibility at 7:57 a.m. was 
worse than zero; all personnel

Operation 

Stinky 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 




1 WAS sitting on the back 
stoop of my shack, waiting 
for the jet, with the shotgun 
at my right hand and a bottle at 
my left, when the dogs began the 
ruckus. 

I took a quick swig from the 
bottle and lumbered to my feet. I 
grabbed a broom and went around 
the house. 

From the way that they were 
yapping, I knew the dogs had cor- 
nered one of the skunks again and 
those skunks were jittery enough 
from the jets without being pes- 
tered further. 

I walked through the place 
where the picket fence had fallen 
down and peered around the cor- 
ner of the shack. It was getting 
dusk, but I could see three dogs 
circling the lilac thicket and, from 
the sound of it, another had bur- 
rowed halfway into it. I knew that 
if I didn’t put an end to it, all hell 
was bound to pop. 

I tried to sneak up on them, but 
I kept stumbling over old tin 
cans and empty bottles and I de- 
cided then and there, come morn- 
ing, I’d get that yard cleaned up. 
I had studied on doing it before, 
but it seemed there always was 
some other thing to do. 

With all the racket I was mak- 
ing, the three dogs outside the 
thicket scooted off, but the one 
that had pushed into the lilacs 
was having trouble backing out. I 
zeroed in on him and smacked 





OPERATION STINKY 



him dead center with the broom. 
The way he got out of there — 
well, he was one of those loose- 
skinned dogs and for a second, I 
swear, it looked like he was going 
to leave without his hide. 

He was yelping and howling 
and he came popping out like a 
cork out of a bottle and he ran 
straight between my legs. I tried 
to keep my balance, but I stepped 
on an empty can and sat down 
undignified. The fall knocked the 
breath out of me and I seemed to 
have some trouble getting squared 
around so I could get on my feet 
again. 

\V/HILE I was getting squared 
around, a skunk walked out 
of the lilac bush and came 
straight toward me. I tried to shoo 
him off, but he wouldn’t shoo. He 
was waving his tail and he seemed 
happy to find me there and he 
walked right up and rubbed 
against me, purring very loudly. 

I didn’t move a muscle. I didn’t 
even bat my eyes. I figured if I 
didn’t move, he might go away. 
The skunks had been living under 
the shack for the last three years 
or so and we got along fine, but 
we had never been what you’d 
call real close. I’d left them alone 
and they’d left me alone and we 
both were satisfied. 

But this happy little critter ap- 
parently had made up his mind 
that I was a friend. Maybe he 



was just plumb grateful to me for 
running off the dogs. 

He walked around me, rubbing 
against me, and then he climbed 
up in my lap and put his feet 
against my chest and looked me 
in the face. I could feel his body 
vibrating with the purring noise 
that he was making. 

He kept standing there, with 
his feet against my chest, looking 
in my face, and his purring kept 
getting soft and loud, fast and 
slow. His ears stood straight up, 
like he expected me to purr back 
at him, and all the time his tail 
kept up its friendly waving. 

Finally I reached up a hand, 
very gingerly, and patted him on 
the head and he didn’t seem to 
mind. I sat there quite a while, 
patting him and him purring at 
me, and he still was friendly. 

So I took a chance and pushed 
him off my lap. 

After a couple of tries, I made 
it to my feet and walked around 
the shack, with the skunk follow- 
ing at my heels. 

I sat down on the stoop again 
and reached for the bottle and 
took a healthy swig, which I 
really needed after all I had been 
through, and while I had the bot- 
tle tilted, the jet shot across the 
treeline to the east and zoomed 
above my clearing and the whole 
place jumped a foot or two. 

I dropped the bottle and 
grabbed the gun, but the jet was 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




gone before I got the barrel up. 

I put down the gun and did 
some steady cussing. 

I had told the colonel only the 
day before that if that jet ever 
flew that close above my shack 
again, I’d take a shot at it and I 
meant every word of it. 

“It don’t seem right,” I told 
him. “A man settles down and 
builds himself a shack and is liv- 
ing peaceable and contented and 
ain’t bothering no one. Then the 
government comes in and builds 
an air base just a couple miles 
away and there ain’t no peace no 
more, with them jets flying no 
more than stove-pipe high. Some- 
times at night they bring a man 
plumb out of bed, standing at at- 
tention in the middle of the room, 
with his bare feet on the cold 
floor.” 

The colonel had been real nice 
about it. He had pointed out how 
we had to have air bases, how our 
lives depended on the planes that 
operated out of them and how 
hard he was trying to arrange the 
flight patterns so they wouldn’t 
upset folks who lived around the 
base. 

T HAD told him how the jets 
were stirring up the skunks 
and he hadn’t laughed, but had 
been sympathetic, and he told me 
how, when he was a boy in Texas, 
he had trapped a lot of skunks. 
I explained that I wasn’t trapping 



these skunks, but that they were, 
you might say, sort of living with 
me, and how I had become at- 
tached to them, how I’d lay 
awake at night and listen to them 
moving around underneath the 
shack and when I heard them, I 
knew I wasn’t alone, but was 
sharing my home with others of 
God’s creatures. 

But even so, he wouldn’t prom- 
ise that the jets would stop flying 
over my place and that was when 
I told him I’d take a shot at the 
next one that did. 

So he pulled a book out of his 
desk and read me a law that said 
it was illegal to shoot at any air- 
craft, but he didn’t scare me none. 

So what happens when I lay 
for a jet? It passes over while I’m 
taking me a drink. 

I quit my cussing when I re- 
membered the bottle, and when I 
thought of it, I could hear it 
gurgling. It had rolled underneath 
the steps and I couldn’t get at it 
right away and I almost went 
mad listening to it gurgle. 

Finally I laid down on my 
belly and reached underneath the 
steps and got it, but it had gur- 
gled dry. I tossed it out into the 
yard and sat down on the steps, 
glum. 

The skunk came out of the 
darkness and climbed the stairs 
and sat down beside me. I reached 
out and patted him kind of ab- 
sent-minded and he purred back 



OPERATION STINKY 




at me. I stopped fretting about 
the bottle. 

“You sure are a funny skunk,” 
I said. “I never knew skunks 
purred.” 

We sat there for a while and I 
told him all about my trouble 
with the jets, the way a man will 
when there’s nobody better around 
than an animal to do the listening, 
and sometimes even when there 
is. 

I wasn’t afraid of him no more 
and I thought how fine it was 
that one of them had finally got- 
ten friendly. I wondered if maybe, 
now that the ice was broken, 
some of them might not come in 
and live with me instead of living 
under the shack. 

Then I got to thinking what a 
story I’d have to tell the boys 
dbwn at the tavern. Then I real- 
ized that no matter how much I 
swore to it, they wouldn’t believe 
a word of what I said. So I de- 
cided to take the proof along. 

I picked up the friendly skunk 
and I said to it: “Come along. I 
want to show you to the boys.” 

I bumped against a tree and 
got tangled up in an old piece of 
chicken wire out in the yard, but 
finally made it out front where I 
had Old Betsy parked. 

¥>ETSY wasn’t the newest or 
the best car ever made, but 
she was the most faithful that any 
man could want. Me and her had 



been through a lot together and 
we understood each other. We 
had a sort of bargain — I polished 
and fed her and she took me 
where I wanted to go and always 
brought me back. No reasonable 
man can ask more of a car than 
that. 

I patted her on the fender and 
said good evening to her, put the 
skunk in the front seat and 
climbed in myself. 

Betsy didn’t want to start. 
She’d rather just stayed home. 
But I talked to her and babied 
her and she finally started, shak- 
ing and shivering and flapping 
her fenders. 

I eased her into gear and 
headed her out into the road. 

“Now take it easy,” I told her. 
“The state coppers have got them- 
selves a speed trap set up some- 
where along this stretch and we 
don’t want to take no chances.” 

Betsy took it slow and gentle 
down to the tavern and I parked 
her there and tucked the skunk 
under my arm and went into the 
place. 

Charley was behind the bar 
and there were quite a lot of 
customers — Johnny Ashland and 
Skinny Patterson and Jack 
O’Neill and half a dozen others. 

I put the skunk on the bar and 
it started walking toward them, 
just like it was eager to make 
friends with them. 

They took one look and they 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




made foxholes under chairs and 
tables. Charley grabbed a bottle 
by the neck and backed into a 
corner. 

“Asa,” he yelled, “you take that 
thing out of here!” 

“It’s all right,” I told him. “It’s 
a friendly cuss.” 

“Friendly or not, get the hell 
out with it!” 

“Get it out!” yelled all the cus- 
tomers. 

I was plenty sore at them. 
Imagine being upset at a friendly 
skunk! 

But I could see I was getting 
nowhere, so I picked it up and 
took it out to Betsy. I found a 
gunny sack and made a nest and 
told it to stay right there, that 
I’d be right back. 

It took me longer than I had 
intended, for I had to tell my 
story and they asked a lot of 
questions and made a lot of jokes 
and they wouldn’t let me buy, 
but kept them set up for me. 

When I went out, I had some 
trouble spotting Betsy and then 
I had to set a course to reach 
her. It took a little time, but after 
tacking back and forth before the 
wind, I finally got close enough 
in passing to reach out and grab 
her. 

I had trouble getting in be- 
cause the door didn’t work the 
way it should, and when I got in, 
I couldn’t find the key. When I 
found it, I dropped it on the 



floor, and when I reached down 
to get it, I fell flat upon the seat. 
It was so comfortable there that 
I decided it was foolish to get up. 
I’d just spend the night there. 

While I was lying there, Betsy’s 
engine started and I chuckled. 
Betsy was disgusted and was go- 
ing home without me. That’s the 
kind of car she was. Just like a 
wife’d act. 

CHE backed out and made a 
^ turn and headed for the road. 
At the road, she stopped and 
looked for other cars, then went 
out on the highway, heading 
straight for home. 

I wasn’t worried any. I knew 
I could trust Betsy. We’d been 
through a lot together and she 
was intelligent, although I 
couldn’t remember she’d ever 
gone home all by herself before. 

I lay there and thought about 
it and the wonder of it was, I 
told myself, that it hadn’t hap- 
pened long before. 

A man is as close to no ma- 
chine as he is to his car. A man 
gets to understand his car and his 
car gets to understand him and 
after a time a real affection must 
grow up between them. So it 
seemed absolutely natural to me 
that the day had to come when a 
car could be trusted just the way 
a horse or dog is, and that a good 
car should be as loyal and faith- 
ful as any dog or horse. 



OPERATION STINKY 



II 




I lay there feeling happy and 
Betsy went head high down the 
road and turned in at the drive- 
way. 

But we had no more than 
stopped when there was a squeal 
of brakes and I heard a car door 
open and someone jump out on 
the gravel. 

I tried to get up, but I was a 
bit slow about it and someone 
jerked the door open and reached 
in and grabbed me by the collar 
and hauled me out. 

The man wore the uniform of 
a state trooper and there was an- 
other trooper just a little ways 
away and the police car stood 
there with its red light flashing. I 
wondered why I hadn’t noticed 
it had been following us and then 
remembered I’d been lying down. 

“Who was driving that car?” 
barked the cop who was holding 
me. 

Before I could answer, the 
other cop looked inside Betsy 
and jumped back about a dozen 
feet. 

“Slade!” he yelled. “There’s a 
skunk in there!” 

“Don’t tell me,” said Slade, 
“that the skunk was driving.” 

And the other one said, “At 
least the skunk is sober.” 

“You leave that skunk alone!” 
I told them. “He’s a friend of 
mine. He isn’t bothering no one.” 

I gave a jerk and Slade’s hand 
slipped from my collar and I 

12 



lunged for Betsy. My chest hit 
the seat and I grabbed the steer- 
ing post and tried to pull myself 
inside. 

Betsy started up with a sudden 
roar and her wheels threw gravel 
that hit the police car like ma- 
chine-gun fire. She lurched for- 
ward and crashed through the 
picket fence, curving for the road. 
She smashed into the lilac thicket 
and went through it and I was 
brushed off. 

I lay there, all tangled up with 
the smashed-down lilac bushes 
and watched Betsy hit the road 
and keep on going. She had done 
the best she could, I consoled my- 
self. She had tried to rescue me 
and it wasn’t her fault that I had 
failed to hang onto her. Now she 
had to make a run for it herself. 
And she seemed to be doing 
pretty well. She sounded and 
went like she had an engine off 
a battleship inside her. 

HP HE two state troopers jumped 
into their car and took off in 
pursuit and I settled down to fig- 
ure out how to untangle myself 
from the lilac thicket. 

I finally managed it and went 
over to the front steps of the 
shack and sat down. I got to 
thinking about the fence and de- 
cided it wasn’t worth repairing. I 
might just as well uproot it and 
use what was left of it for 
kindling. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




And I wondered about Betsy 
and what might be happening to 
her, but I wasn’t really worried. 
I was pretty sure she could take 
care of herself. 

I was right about that, for in a 
little while the state troopers 
came back again and parked in 
the driveway. They saw me sit- 
ting on the steps and came over 
to me. 

“Where’s Betsy?” I asked them. 

“Betsy who?” Slade asked. 

“Betsy is the car,” I said. 

Slade swore. “Got away. Trav- 
eling without lights at a hundred 
miles an hour. It’ll smash into 
something, sure as hell.” 

I shook my head at that. “Not 
Betsy. She knows all the roads 
for fifty miles around.” 

Slade thought I was being 
smart. He grabbed me and jerked 
me to my feet. “You got a lot to 
explain.” He shoved me at the 
other trooper and the other 
trooper caught me. “Toss him in 
the back seat, Ernie, and let’s get 
going.” 

Ernie didn’t seem to be as sore 
as Slade. He said: “This way, 
Pop.” 

Once they got me in the car, 
they didn’t want to talk with me. 
Ernie rode in back with me and 
Slade drove. We hadn’t gone a 
mile when I dozed off. 

When I woke up, we were just 
pulling into the parking area in 
front of the state police barracks. 

OPERATION STINKY 



I got out and tried to walk, but 
one of them got on each side of 
me and practically dragged me 
along. 

We went into a sort of office 
with a desk, some chairs and a 
bench. A man sat behind the 
desk. 

“What you got there?” he 
asked. 

“Damned if I know,” said 
Slade, all burned up. “You won’t 
believe it, Captain.” 

Ernie took me over to a chair 
and sat me down. “I’ll get you 
some coffee, Pop. We want to 
talk with you. We have to get 
you sober.” 

I thought that was nice of him. 

I drank a lot of coffee and I 
began to see a little better and 
things were in straight lines in- 
stead of going round in circles — 
things I could see, that is. It was 
different when I tried to think. 
Things that had seemed okay be- 
fore now seemed mighty queer, 
like Betsy going home all by her- 
self, for instance. 

"FINALLY they took me over 
to the desk and the captain 
asked me a lot of questions about 
who I was and how old I was 
and where I lived, until eventu- 
ally we got around to what was 
on their minds. 

I didn’t hold back anything. I 
told them about the jets and the 
skunks and the talk I had with 

13 




the colonel. I told them about 
the dogs and the friendly skunk 
and how Betsy had got disgusted 
with me and gone home by her- 
self. 

“Tell me, Mr. Bayles,” said the 
captain, “are you a mechanic? I 
know you told me you are a day 
laborer and work at anything 
that you can get. But I wonder 
if you might not tinker around 
in your spare time, working on 
your car.” 

“Captain,” I told him truth- 
fully, “I wouldn’t know which end 
of a wrench to grab hold of.” 

“You never worked on Betsy, 
then?” 

“Just took good care of her.” 

“Has anyone else ever worked 
on her?” 

“I wouldn’t let no one lay a 
hand on her.” 

“Then you can’t explain how 
that car could possibly operate by 
itself?” 

“No, sir. Betsy is a smart car, 
Captain — ” 

“You’re sure you weren’t driv- 
ing?” 

“I wasn’t driving. I was just 
taking it easy while Betsy took 
me home.” 

The captain threw down his 
pencil in disgust. “I give up!” 

He got up from the desk. “I’m 
going out and make some more 
coffee,” he said to Slade. “You 
see what you can do.” 

“There’s one thing,” Ernie said 



to Slade as the captain left. “The 
skunk — ” 

“What about the skunk?” 

“Skunks don’t wave their tails,” 
said Ernie. “Skunks don’t purr.” 

“This skunk did,” Slade said 
sarcastically. “This was a special 
skunk. This was a ring-tailed 
wonder of a skunk. Besides, the 
skunk hasn’t got a thing to do 
with it. He was just out for a 
ride.” 

“You boys haven’t got a little 
nip?” I asked. I was feeling 
mighty low. 

“Sure,” said Ernie. He went to 
a locker in one corner of the 
room and took out a bottle. 

Through, the windows, I could 
see that the east was beginning 
to brighten. Dawn wasn’t far 
away. 

T" 1 HE telephone rang. Slade 
picked it up. 

Ernie motioned to me and I 
walked across to where he stood 
by the locker. He handed me the 
bottle. 

“Take it easy, Pop,” he advised 
me, “You don’t want to hang one 
on again.” 

I took it easy. About a tumbler 
and a half, I’d reckon. 

Slade hollered, “Hey!” at us. 

“What’s going on?” asked Ernie. 

He took the bottle from me, 
not by force exactly, but almost. 

“A farmer found the car,” said 
Slade. “It took a shot at his dog.” 



14 



GAiAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“It took a what — a shot at his 
dogs?” Ernie stuttered. 

“That’s what the fellow says. 
Went out to get in the cows. 
Early. Going fishing and was anx- 
ious to get the morning chores 
done. Found what he thought was 
an abandoned car at the end of 
a lane.” 

“And the shot?” 

“I’m coming to that. Dog ran 
up barking. The car shot out a 
spark — a big spark. It knocked 
the dog over. He got up and ran. 
Car shot out another spark. 
Caught him in the rump. Fellow 
says the pooch is blistered.” 

Slade headed for the door. 
“Come on, the both of you.” 

“We may need you, Pop,” said 
Ernie. 

We ran out and piled into the 
car. 

“Where is this farm?” asked 
Ernie. 

“Out west of the air base,” said 
Slade. 

The farmer was waiting for us 
at the barnyard gate. He jumped 
in when Slade stopped. 

‘The car’s still there,” he said. 
“I been watching. It hasn’t come 
out.” 

“Any other way it could get 
out?” 

“Nope. Woods and fields is all. 
That lane is dead end.” 

Slade grunted in satisfaction. 
He drove down the road and ran 
the police car across the mouth 



of the lane, blocking it entirely. 

‘We walk from here,” he said. 

“Right around that bend,” the 
farmer told us. 

We walked around the bend 
and saw it was Betsy, all right. 

“That’s my car,” I said. 

“Let’s scatter out a bit,” said 
Slade. “It might start shooting at 
us.” 

He loosened the gun in his 
holster. 

“Don’t you go shooting up my 
car,” I warned him, but he paid 
me no mind. 

Like he said, we scattered out 
a bit, the four of us, and went to- 
ward the car. It seemed funny 
that we should be acting that 
way, as if Betsy was an enemy 
and we were stalking her. 

She looked the same as ever, 
just an old beat-up jalopy that 
had a lot of sense and a lot of 
loyalty. And I kept thinking 
about how she always got me 
places and always got me back. 

Then all at once she charged 
us. She was headed in the wrong 
direction and she was backing up, 
but she charged us just the same. 

She gave a little leap and was 
running at full speed and going 
faster every second and I saw 
Slade pull his gun. 

T JUMPED out in the middle 
X of the lane and waved my 
arms. I didn’t trust that Slade. I 
was afraid that if I couldn’t get 



OPERATION STINKY 



15 




Betsy stopped, he’d shoot her full 
of holes. 

But Betsy didn’t stop. She kept 
right on charging us and she was 
going faster than an old wreck 
like her had any right to go. 

“Jump, you fool!” shouted 
Ernie. “She’ll run over you!” 

I jumped, but my heart wasn’t 
in the jump. I thought that if 
things had come to the pass 
where Betsy’d run me down, 
there wasn’t too much left for 
me to go on living for. 

I stubbed my toe and fell flat 
on my face, but even while I was 
falling, I saw Betsy leave the 
ground as if she was going to leap 
over me. I knew right away that 
I’d never been in any danger, 
that Betsy never had any inten- 
tion of hitting me at all. 

She sailed right up into the 
sky, with her wheels still spin- 
ning, as if she was backing up a 
long, steep hill that was invisible. 

I twisted around and sat up 
and stared at her and she sure 
was a pretty sight. She was flying 
just like an airplane. I was down- 
right proud of her. 

Slade stood with his mouth 
open and his gun hanging at his 
side. He never even tried to fire 
it. He probably forgot that he 
even had a gun in his hand. 

Betsy went up above the tree- 
line and the Sun made her spar- 
kle and gleam — I’d polished her 
only the week before last — and 



I thought how swell it was she 
had learned to fly. 

It was then I saw the jet and 
I tried to yell a warning for 
Betsy, but my mouth dried up 
like there was alum in it and the 
yell wouldn’t come out. 

It didn’t take more than a sec- 
ond, probably, although it seemed 
to me that days passed while 
Betsy hung there and the jet 
hung there and I knew they 
would crash. 

Then there were pieces flying 
all over the sky and the jet was 
smoking and heading for a corn- 
field off to the left of us. 

I sat there limp in the middle 
of the lane and watched the 
pieces that had been Betsy fall- 
ing back to Earth and I felt sick. 
It was an awful thing to see. 

The pieces came down and you 
could hear them falling, thudding 
on the ground, but there was one 
piece that didn’t fall as fast as 
the others. It just seemed to glide. 

I watched, wondering why it 
glided while all the other pieces 
fell and I saw it was a fender 
and that it seemed to be rocking 
back and forth, as if it wanted to 
fall, too, only something held it 
back. 

It glided down to the ground 
near the edge of the woods. It 
landed easy and rocked a little, 
then tipped over. And when it 
tipped over, it spilled something 
out of it. The thing got up and 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




shook itself and trotted straight 
into the woods. 

It was the friendly skunk! 

T> Y THIS time, everyone was 
running. Ernie was running 
for the farmhouse to phone the 
base about the jet and Slade and 
the farmer were running toward 
the cornfield, where the jet had 
plowed a path in the corn wide 
enough to haul a barn through. 

I got up and walked off the 
lane to where I had seen some 
pieces falling. I found a few of 
them — a headlight, the lens not 
even broken, and a wheel, all 
caved in and twisted, and the ra- 
diator ornament. It knew it was 
no use. No one could ever get 
Betsy back together. 

I stood there with the radiator 
ornament in my hand and 
thought of all the good times 
Betsy and I had had together — 
how she’d take me to the tavern 
and wait until I was ready to go 
home, and how we’d go fishing 
and eat a picnic lunch together, 
and how we’d go up north deer 
hunting in the fall. 

While I was standing there, 
Slade and the farmer came down 
from the cornfield with the pilot 
walking between them. He was 
sort of rubber-legged and they 
were holding him up. He had a 
glassy look in his eyes and he 
was babbling a bit. 

When they reached the lane, 



they let loose of him and he sat 
down heavily. 

“When the hell,” he asked 
them, “did they start making fly- 
ing cars?” 

They didn’t answer him. In- 
stead, Slade yelled at me, “Hey, 
Pop! You leave that wreckage 
alone. Don’t touch none of it” 

“I got a right to touch it,” I 
told him. “It’s my car.” 

“You leave it alone! There’s 
something funny going on here. 
That junk might tell us what it is 
if no one monkeys with it” 

So I dropped the radiator orna- 
ment and went back to the lane. 

The four of us sat down and 
waited. The pilot seemed to be 
all right. He had a cut above one 
eye and some blood had run 
down across his face, but that was 
all that was the matter with him. 
He asked for a cigarette and 
Slade gave him one and lit it. 

Down at the end of the lane, 
we heard Ernie backing the po- 
lice car out of the way. Pretty 
soon he came walking up to us. 

“They’ll be here right away.” 

He sat down with us. We didn’t 
say anything about what had 
happened. I guess we were all 
afraid to talk. 

In less than fifteen minutes, the 
air base descended on us. First 
there was an ambulance and they 
loaded the pilot aboard and left 
in a lot of dust. 

Behind the ambulance was a 



OPERATION STINKY 



17 




fire rig and behind the fire rig 
was a jeep with the colonel in it 
Behind the colonel’s jeep were 
other jeeps and three or four 
trucks, all loaded with men, and 
in less time than it takes to tell 
it the place was swarming. 

TP HE colonel was red in the 
face and you could see he was 
upset. After all, why wouldn’t he 
be? This was the first time a 
plane had ever collided in mid- 
air with a car. 

The colonel came tramping up 
to Slade and he started hollering 
at Slade and Slade hollered right 
back at him and I wondered why 
they were sore at one another, 
but that wasn’t it at all. That was 
just the way they talked when 
they got excited. 

All around, there was a lot of 
running here and there and a lot 
more hollering, but it didn’t last 
too long. Before the colonel got 
through yelling back and forth 
with Slade, the entire area was 
ringed in with men and the situa- 
tion was in Air Force hands. 

When the colonel finished talk- 
ing with Slade, he walked over to 
me. 

“So it was your car,” he said. 
The way he said it, you’d thought 
it was my fault. 

“Yes, it was,” I told him, “and 
I’m going to sue you. That was a 
dam good car.” 

The colonel went on looking at 

18 



me as if I had no right to live, 
then suddenly seemed to recog- 
nize me. 

“Say, wait a minute,” he said. 
“Weren’t you in to see me just 
the other day?” 

“I sure was. I told you about 
my skunks. It was one of them 
that was in Old Betsy.” 

“Hold up there, old-timer,” said 
the colonel. “You lost me. Let’s 
hear that again.” 

“Old Betsy was the car,” I ex- 
plained, “and the skunk was in 
her. When your jet crashed into 
it, he rode a fender down.” 

“You mean the skunk — the 
fender — the — ” 

“It just sort of floated down,” 
I finished telling him. 

“Corporal,” the colonel said to 
Slade, “have you further use for 
this man?” 

“Just drunkenness,” said Slade. 
“Not worth mentioning.” 

“I’d like to take him back to 
the base with me.” 

“I’d appreciate it,” Slade said 
in a quivery kind of voice. 

“Come on, then,” said the colo- 
nel and I followed him to the 
jeep. 

We sat in the back seat and a 
soldier drove and he didn’t waste 
no time. The colonel and I didn’t 
talk much. We just hung on and 
hoped that we’d live through it. 
At least, that’s the way I felt. 

Back at the base, the colonel 
sat down at his desk and pointed 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




at a chair for me to sit in. Then 
he leaned back and studied me. I 
was sure glad I had done nothing 
wrong, for the way he looked at 
me, I’d just have had to up and 
confess it if I had. 

“You said some queer things 
back there,” the colonel started. 
“Now suppose you just rear back 
comfortable in that chair and tell 
me all about it, not leaving out 
a thing.” 

So I told him all about it and 
I went into a lot of detail to ex- 
plain my viewpoint and he didn’t 
interrupt, but just sat listening. 
He was the best listener I ever 
ran across. 

HEN I was all finished, he 
reached for a pad and pencil. 
“Let’s get a few points down,” 
he said. “You say the car had 
never operated by itself before?” 
“Not that I know of,” I an- 
swered honestly. “It might have 
practiced while I wasn’t looking, 
of course.” 

“And it never flew before?” 

I shook my head. 

“And when it did both of these 
things, there was this skunk of 
yours aboard?” 

“That’s right” 

“And you say this skunk glided 
down in a fender after the crash?” 
“The fender tipped over and 
the critter ran into the woods.” 
“Don’t you think it’s a little 
strange that the fender should 



glide down when all the other 
wreckage fell ker-plunk?” 

I admitted that it did seem 
slightly strange. 

“Now about this skunk. You 
say it purred?” 

“It purred real pretty.” 

“And waved its tail?” 

“Just like a dog,” I said. 

The colonel pushed the pad 
away and leaned back in his 
chair. He crossed his arms and 
sort of hugged himself. 

“As a matter of personal knowl- 
edge,” he told me, “gained from 
years of boyhood trapping, I can 
tell you that no skunk purrs or 
ever wags its tail.” 

“I know what you’re thinking,” 
I said, indignant, “but I wasn’t 
that drunk. I’d had a drink or two 
to while away the time I was 
waiting for the jet. But I saw the 
skunk real plain and I knew he 
was a skunk and I can remember 
that he purred. He was a friendly 
cuss. He acted as if he liked me 
and he—” 

“Okay,” the colonel said. 
“Okay.” 

We sat there looking at one 
another. All at once, he grinned. 

“You know,” he said, “I find 
quite suddenly that I need an 
aide.” 

“I ain’t joining up,” I replied 
stubbornly. “You couldn’t get me 
within a quarter mile of one of 
them jets. Not if you roped and 
tied me.” 



OPERATION STINKY

“A civilian aide. Three hundred 
a month and keep .” 

“Colonel, I don’t hanker none 
for the military life.” 

“And all the liquor you can 
drink.” 

“Where do I sign?” I asked. 

And that is how I got to be 
the colonel’s aide. 

I thought he was crazy and I 
still think so. He’d been a whole 
lot better off if he’d quit right 
there. But he had an idea by the 
tail and he was the kind of gam- 
bling fool who’d ride a hunch to 
death. 

We got along just fine, al- 
though at times we had our dif- 
ferences. The first one was over 
that foolish business about con- 
fining me to base. I raised quite 
a ruckus, but he made it stick. 

“You’d go out and get slob- 
bered up and gab your head off,” 
he told me. “I want you to button 
up your lip and keep it buttoned 
up. Why else do you think I 
hired you?” 

IT WASN’T so bad. There 
wasn’t a blessed thing to do. I 
never had to lift my hand to do 
a lick of work. The chow was fit 
to eat and I had a place to sleep 
and the colonel kept his word 
about all the liquor I could drink. 

For several days, I saw nothing 
of him. Then one afternoon, I 
dropped around to pass the time 
of day. I hadn’t more than got 



there when a sergeant came in 
with a bunch of papers in his 
hand. He seemed to be upset. 

“Here’s the report on that car, 
sir,” he said. 

The colonel took the papers 
and leafed through a few of them. 
“Sergeant, I can’t make head nor 
tail of this.” 

“Some of it I can’t, either, sir.” 
“Now this?” said the colonel, 
pointing. 

“That’s a computer, sir.” 

“Cars don’t have computers.” 
“Well, sir, that’s what I said, 
too. But we found the place 
where it was attached to the en- 
gine block.” 

“Attached? Welded?” 

“Well, not exactly welded. Like 
it was a part of the block. Like it 
had been cast as a part of it. 
There was no sign of welding.” 
“You’re sure it’s a computer?” 
“Connally said it was, sir. He 
knows about computers. But it’s 
not like any he’s ever seen before. 
It works on a different principle 
than any he has seen, he says. 
But he says it makes a lot of 
sense, sir. The principle, that is. 
He says—” 

“Well, go on!” the colonel 
yelled. 

“He says its capacity is at least 
a thousand times that of the best 
computer that we have. He says 
it might not be stretching your 
imagination too far to say that it’s 
intelligent.” 



20

“How do you mean — intelli- 
gent?” 

“Well, Connally says a rig 
like that might be capable of 
thinking for itself, sir.” 

“My God!” the colonel said. 
He sat there for a minute, as if 
he might be thinking. Then he 
turned a page and pointed at 
something else. 

“That’s another part, sir,” the 
sergeant said. “A drawing of the 
part. We don’t know what it is.” 
“Don’t know!” 

“We never saw anything like 
it, sir. We don’t have any idea 
what it might be for. It was at- 
tached to the transmission, sir.” 
“And this?” 

“That’s an analysis of the gas- 
oline. Funny thing about that, sir. 
We found the tank, all twisted 
out of shape, but there was some 
gas still left in it. It hadn’t — ” 
“But why an analysis?” 
“Because it’s not gasoline, sir. 
It is something else. It was gas- 
oline, but it’s been changed, sir.” 
“Is that all, Sergeant?” 

T^HE sergeant, I could see, was 
beginning to sweat a little. 
“No, sir, there’s more to it. It’s all 
in that report. We got most all 
the wreckage, sir. Just bits here 
and there are missing. We are 
working now on reassembling it.” 
“Reassembling — ” 

“Maybe, sir, pasting it back to- 
gether is a better way to put it.” 



“It will never run again?” 

“I don’t think so, sir. It’s pretty 
well smashed up. But if it could 
be put back together whole, it 
would be the best car that was 
ever made. The speedometer says 
80,000 miles, but it’s in new-car 
condition. And there are alloys in 
it that we can’t even guess at.” 
The sergeant paused. “If you’ll 
permit me, sir, it’s a very funny 
business.” 

“Yes, indeed,” the colonel said. 
“Thank you, Sergeant. A very 
funny business.” 

The sergeant turned to leave. 
“Just a minute,” said the colo- 
nel. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I’m sorry about this, Sergeant, 
but you and the entire detail that 
was assigned to the car are re- 
stricted to the base. I don’t want 
this leaking out. Tell your men, 
will you? I’ll make it tough on 
anyone who talks.” 

“Yes, sir,” the sergeant said, sa- 
luting very polite, but looking 
like he could have slit the colo- 
nel’s throat. 

When the sergeant was gone, 
the colonel said to me: “Asa, if 
there’s something that you should 
say now and you fail to say it and 
it comes out later and makes a 
fool of me, I’ll wring your 
scrawny little neck.” 

“Cross my heart,” I said. 

He looked at me funny. “Do 
you know what that skunk was?” 



OPERATION STINKY 



21 




I shook my head. 

"It wasn’t any skunk,” he said. 
"I guess it’s up to us to find out 
what it is.” 

"But it isn’t here. It ran into 
the woods.” 

"It could be hunted down.” 

“Just you and me?” 

"Why just you and me when 
there are two thousand men right 
on this base?” 

“But-” 

"You mean they wouldn’t take 
too kindly to hunting down a 
skunk?” 

“Something like that, Colonel. 
They might go out, but they 
wouldn’t hunt. They’d try not to 
find it.” 

“They’d hunt if there was five 
thousand dollars waiting for the 
man who brought the right one 
in.” 

I looked at him as if he’d gone 
off his rocker, 

“Believe me,” said the colonel, 
"it would be worth it. Every 
penny of it.” 

I told you he was crazy. 

T DIDN’T go out with the skunk 
hunters. I knew just how little 
chance there was of ever finding 
it. It could have gotten clear out 
of the county by that time or 
found a place to hole up where 
one would never find it. 

And, anyhow, I didn’t need five 
thousand. I was drawing down 
good pay and drinking regular. 



The next day, I dropped in to 
see the colonel. The medical offi- 
cer was having words with him. 

"You got to call it off!” the saw- 
bones shouted. 

"I can’t call it off,” the colonel 
yelled. “I have to have that ani- 
mal.” 

"You ever see a man who tried 
to catch a skunk bare-handed?” 

“No, I never have.” 

“I got eleven of them now,” 
the sawbones said. “I won’t have 
no more of it.” 

“Captain,” said the colonel, 
“you may have a lot more than 
eleven before this is all over.” 

“You mean you won’t call it 
off, sir?” 

“No, I won’t.” 

“Then I’ll have it stopped.” 

“Captain!” said the colonel and 
his voice was deadly. 

‘You’re insane,” the sawbones 
said. “No court martial in the 
land — ” 

“Captain.” 

But the captain did not answer. 
He turned straight around and 
left. 

The colonel looked at me. “It’s 
sometimes tough,” he said. 

I knew that someone better 
find that skunk or the colonel’s 
name was mud. 

“What I don’t understand,” I 
said, “is why you want that 
skunk. He’s just a skunk that 
purrs.” 

The colonel sat down at his 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




desk and put his head between 
his hands. 

“My God,” he moaned, “how 
stupid can men get?” 

“Pretty stupid,” I told him, 
“but I still don’t understand — ” 
“Look,” the colonel said, “some- 
one jiggered up that car of yours. 
You say you didn’t do it. You say 
no one else could have done it. 
The boys who are working on it 
say there’s stuff in it that’s not 
been even thought of.” 

“If you think that skunk — ” 
The colonel raised his fist and 
smacked it on the desk. 

“Not a skunk! Something that 
looks like a skunk! Something 
that knows more about machines 
than you or I or any human being 
will ever get to know!” 

“But it hasn’t got no hands. 
How could it do what you think?” 

H E NEVER got to answer. 

The door burst in and two 
of the saddest sacks outside the 
guardhouse stumbled in. They 
didn’t bother to salute. 

“Colonel, sir,” one of them said, 
heaving hard. “Colonel, sir, we 
got one. We didn’t even have to 
catch it. We whistled at it and it 
followed us.” 

The skunk walked in behind 
them, waving its tail and purring. 
It walked right over to me and 
rubbed against my legs. When I 
reached down and picked it up, it 
purred so loud I was afraid it 



would go ahead and explode. 

“That the one?” the colonel 
asked me. 

“He’s the one,” I said. 

The colonel grabbed the phone. 
“Get me Washington. General 
Sanders. At the Pentagon.” 

He waved his hand at us. “Get 
out of here!” 

“But, Colonel, sir, the money — ” 

“You’ll get it. Now get out of 
here.” 

He looked exactly like you 
might imagine a man might look 
right after he’s been told he’s not 
going to be shot at dawn. 

We turned around and got out 
of there. 

At the door, four of the tough- 
est-looking hombres this side of 
Texas were waiting, with rifles in 
their hands. 

“Don’t pay no attention to us, 
Mac,” one of them said to me. 
‘We’re just your bodyguards.” 

They were my bodyguards, all 
right. They went every place I 
went. And the skunk went with 
me, too. That, of course, was why 
they stuck around. They didn’t 
care a rap about me. It was the 
skunk that was getting the body- 
guarding. 

And that skunk stuck closer to 
me than paper to the wall. He fol- 
lowed at my heels and walked be- 
tween my feet, but mostly he 
wanted me to carry him or to let 
him perch on my shoulder. And 
he purred all the blessed time. 



OPERATION STINKY

Either he figured I was the only 
true friend he had or he thought 
I was a soft touch. 

Life got a little complicated. 
The skunk slept with me and the 
four guards stayed in the room. 
The skunk and one of the guards 
went to the latrine with me while 
the others kept close. I had no 
privacy at all. I said it wasn’t de- 
cent. I said it was unconstitu- 
tional. It didn’t make no differ- 
ence. There was nothing I could 
do. There were, it turned out, 
twelve of them guards and they 
worked in eight-hour shifts. 

For a couple of days, I didn’t 
see the colonel and I thought it 
was funny how he couldn’t rest 
until he’d found the skunk and 
then paid no attention to it. 

T DID a lot of thinking about 
what the colonel had said 
about the skunk not being a 
skunk at all, but something that 
only looked like a skunk and how 
it might know more, some ways, 
than we did. And the more I lived 
with it, the more I began to be- 
lieve that he might be right. Al- 
though it still seemed impossible 
that any critter without hands 
could know much about machin- 
ery in the first place, let alone do 
anything about it. 

Then I got to remembering 
how me and Betsy had under- 
stood each other and I carried 
that a little further, imagining 

24 



how a man and machine might 
get to know one another so well, 
they could even talk together and 
how the man, even if he didn’t 
have hands, might help the ma- 
chine to improve itself. And while 
it sounds somewhat far-fetched 
just telling it, thinking of it in the 
secrecy of one’s mind made it 
sound all right and it gave a sort 
of warm feeling to imagine that 
one could get to be downright 
personal friendly with machines. 

When you come to think of it, 
it’s not so far-fetched, either. 

Perhaps, I told myself, when I 
had gone into the tavern and had 
left the skunk bedded down in 
Betsy, the skunk might have 
looked her over and felt sorry for 
such a heap of junk, like you or 
I would feel sorry for a homeless 
cat or an injured dog. And maybe 
the skunk had set out, right then 
and there, to fix her up as best 
he could, probably cannibalizing 
some metal here and there, from 
places where it would not be 
missed, to grow the computer and 
the other extra pieces on her. 

Probably he couldn’t under- 
stand, for the life of him, why 
they’d been left off to start with. 
Maybe, to him, a machine was 
no machine at all without those 
pieces on it. More than likely, he 
thought Betsy was just a botched- 
up job. 

The guards began calling the 
skunk Stinky and that was a libel 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




because he never stunk a bit, but 
was one of the best-mannered, 
even-tempered animals that I 
have ever been acquainted with. 
I told them it wasn’t right, but 
they just laughed at me, and be- 
fore long the whole base knew 
about the name and everywhere 
we went they’d yell “Hi, Stinky” 
at us. He didn’t seem to mind, so 
I began to think of him as Stinky, 
too. 

I got it figured out to my own 
satisfaction that maybe Stinky 
could have fixed up Betsy and 
even why he fixed up Betsy. But 
the one thing I couldn’t figure out 
was where he’d come from to 
start with. I thought on it a lot 
and came up with no answers ex- 
cept some foolish ones that 
were too much for even me to 
swallow. 

I went over to see the colonel 
a couple of times, but the ser- 
geants and the lieutenants threw 
me out before I could get to see 
him. So I got sore about it and 
decided not to go there any more 
until he sent for me. 

/~kNE day, he did send for me 
^-'and when I got there, the 
place was crowded with a lot of 
brass. The colonel was talking to 
an old gray-haired, eagle-beaked 
gent who had a fierce look about 
him and a rat-trap jaw and was 
wearing stars. 

“General,” said the colonel, 



“may I introduce Stinky’s special 
friend?” 

The general shook hands with 
me. Stinky, who was riding on 
my shoulder, purred at him. 

The general took a good look 
at Stinky. 

“Colonel,” he said, “I hope to 
God you’re right. Because if you 
aren’t and this business ever 
leaks, the Air Force goose is 
cooked. The Army and the Navy 
would never let us live it down 
and what Congress would do to 
us would be a crimson shame.” 

The colonel gulped a little. 
“Sir, I’m sure I’m right.” 

“I don’t know why I let myself 
get talked into this,” the general 
said. “It’s the most hare-brained 
scheme I have ever heard of.” 

He had another squint at 
Stinky. 

“He looks like a common skunk 
to me,” the general said. 

The colonel introduced me to a 
bunch of other colonels and a 
batch of majors, but he didn’t 
bother with the captains if there 
were any there and I shook hands 
with them and Stinky purred at 
them and everything was cozy. 

One of the colonels picked up 
Stinky, but he kicked up quite a 
fuss trying to get back to me. 

The general said to me, “You 
seem to be the one he wants to 
be with.” 

“He’s a friend of mine,” I ex- 
plained. 



OPERATION STINKY 



25 




“I be damned,” the general 
said. 

After lunch, the colonel and the 
general came for me and Stinky 
and we went over to a hangar. 
The place had been cleared out 
and there was only one plane in 
it, one of the newer jets. There 
was a mob of people waiting for 
us, some of them military, but a 
lot of them were technicians in 
ordinary clothes or in dungarees. 
Some of them had clipboards 
tucked under their arms and 
some were carrying tools or what 
I imagined must be tools, al- 
though never before have I ever 
seen contraptions such as those. 
And there were different pieces 
of equipment scattered here and 
there. 

“Now, Asa,” the colonel said to 
me, “I want you to get into that 
jet with Stinky.” 

“And do what?” I asked. 

“Just get in and sit But don’t 
touch anything. You might get 
the detail all fouled up.” 

It seemed a funny business and 
I hesitated. 

“Don’t be afraid,” the general 
assured me. “There won’t noth- 
ing happen. You just get in and 
sit” 

So I did and it was a foolish 
business. I climbed up where the 
pilot sits and sat down in his seat 
and it was a crazy-looking place. 
There were instruments and gadg- 
ets and doodads all over. I was 



almost afraid to move for fear of 
touching one of them because 
God knows what might have 
happened if I had. 

¥ GOT in and sat and I kept 
myself interested for a time 
by just looking at all the stuff 
and trying to figure out what it 
was for, but I never rightly got 
much of it figured out 

But finally I had looked at 
everything a hundred times and 
puzzled over it and there wasn’t 
anything more to do and I was 
awful bored. But I remembered 
all the money I was pulling down 
and the free drinking I was get- 
ting and I thought if a man just 
had to sit in a certain place to 
earn it, why, it was all right. 

Stinky didn’t pay any attention 
to any of the stuff. He settled 
down in my lap and went to 
sleep, or at least he seamed to go 
to sleep. He took it easy, for a 
fact. Once in a while, he opened 
an eye or twitched an ear, but 
that was all he did. 

I hadn’t thought much about it 
at first, but after I’d sat there for 
an hour or so, I began to get an 
idea of why they wanted me and 
Stinky in the plane. They figured, 
I told myself, that if they put 
Stinky in the ship, he might feel 
sorry for it, too, and do the same 
kind of job on it as he had done 
on Betsy. But if that was what 
they thought, they sure were get- 



26 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ting fooled, for Stinky didn't do a 
thing except curl up and go to 
sleep. 

We sat there for several hours 
and finally they told us that we 
could get out. 

And that is how Operation 
Stinky got off to a start. That is 
what they called all that foolish- 
ness. It does beat hell, the kind of 
names the Air Force can think 
up. 

It went on like that for sev- 
eral days. Me and Stinky would 
go out in the morning and sit in 
a plane for several hours, then 
take a break for noon, then go 
back for a few hours more. Stinky 
didn’t seem to mind. He’d just as 
soon be there as anywhere. All 
he’d do would be curl up in my 
lap and in five minutes he’d be 
dozing. 

As the days went on, the gen- 
eral and the colonel and all the 
technicians who cluttered up the 
hangar got more and more ex- 
cited. They didn’t say a word, but 
you could see they were aching 
to bust out, only they held it 
back. And I couldn’t understand 
that, for as far as I could see, 
there was nothing whatsoever 
happening. 

Apparently their work didn’t 
end when Stinky and I left. Eve- 
ning after evening, lights burned 
in the hangar and a gang was 
working there and they had 
guards around three deep. 



One day they pulled out the 
jet we had been sitting in and 
hauled in another and we sat in 
that and it was just the same as 
it had been before. Nothing really 
happened. And yet the air inside 
that hangar was so filled with 
tension and excitement, you could 
fairly light a fire with it. 

It sure beat me what was go- 
ing on. 

Gradually the same sort of ten- 
sion spread throughout the entire 
base and there were some funny 
goings-on. You never saw an out- 
fit that was faster on its toes. A 
construction gang moved in and 
started to put up buildings and as 
soon as one of them was com- 
pleted, machinery was installed. 
More and more people kept ar- 
riving until the base began to 
look like an anthill with a hot- 
foot. 

/~kN ONE of the walks I took, 
^ with the guards trailing 
along beside me, I found out 
something else that made my 
eyes bug. They were installing a 
twelve-foot woven fence, topped 
with barbed wire, all around the 
area. 

And inside the fence, there 
were so many guards, they almost 
walked on one another. 

I was a little scared when I got 
back from the walk, because from 
what I saw, this thing I’d been 
pitchforked into was bigger and 



OPERATION STINKY 



27 




more important than I had ever 
dreamed. Up until then, I’d fig- 
ured it was just a matter of the 
colonel having his neck stuck out 
so far, he could never pull it back. 
All along, I had been feeling 
sorry for him because that gen- 
eral looked like the kind of gent 
who would stand for just so much 
tomfoolery before he lowered the 
boom. 

It was about this time that 
they began to dig a big pit out in 



the center of one of the runways. 
I went over one day to watch it 
and it didn’t make no sense at all. 
Here they had a nice, smooth 
runway they’d spent a lot of 
money to construct and now they 
were digging it up to make what 
looked like a swimming pool. I 
asked around about it, but the 
people that I talked to either 
didn’t know or they weren’t 
talking. 

Me and Stinky kept on sitting 




28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in the planes. We were on our 
sixth one now. And there wasn’t 
any change. I sat, bored stiff, 
while Stinky took it easy. 

One evening the colonel sent a 
sergeant over to say he’d like to 
see me. 

I went in and sat down and put 
Stinky on the desk. He lay down 
on top of it and looked from one 
to the other of us. 

“Asa,” said the colonel, “I 
think we got it made.” 



“You mean you been getting 
stuff?” 

“We’ve got enough we actually 
understand to give us unques- 
tioned air superiority. We’re a 
good ten years, if not a hundred, 
depending on how much we can 
use, ahead of the rest of them. 
They’ll never catch us now.” 
“But all Stinky did was sleep!” 
“All he did,” the colonel said, 
“was to redesign each ship. In 
some instances, there were prin- 
ciples involved that don’t make a 
bit of sense, but I’ll bet they will 
later. And in other cases, what he 
did was so simple and so basic 
that we’re wondering why we 
never thought of it ourselves.” 
“Colonel, what is Stinky?” 

“I don’t know,” he said. 

“You got an idea, though.” 
“Sure, an idea. But that’s all it 
is. It embarrasses me even to 
think of it.” 

“I don’t embarrass easy.” 

“Okay, then — Stinky is like 
nothing on Earth. My guess is 
that he’s from some other planet, 
maybe even some other solar sys- 
tem. I think he crossed space to 
us. How or why, I have no no- 
tion. His ship might have been 
wrecked and he got into a life- 
boat and made it here.” 

“But if there was a lifeboat — ” 
“We’ve combed every foot of 
ground for miles around.” 

“And no lifeboat?” 

“No lifeboat,” said the colonel. 




OPERATION STINKY 



29 



Z'" 1 ETTING that idea down took 
a little doing, but I did it 
Then I got to wondering about 
something else. 

“Colonel,” I said, “you claim 
Stinky fixed up the ships, made 
them even better. Now how could 
he have done that with no hands 
and just sleeping and never 
touching a thing?” 

“You tell me,” said the colonel. 
“I’ve heard a bunch of guesses. 
The only one that makes any 
kind of sense — and cockeyed 
sense at that — is telekinesis.” 

I sat there and admired that 
word. “What’s it mean. Colonel?” 
I wanted to use it on the boys at 
the tavern, if I ever got back 
there, and I wanted to get it 
right. 

“Moving things by the power 
of thought,” he said. 

“But there wasn’t nothing 
moved,” I objected. “All the im- 
provements in Betsy and the 
planes came from right inside 
them, not stuff moved in.” 

“That could be done by tele- 
kinesis, too.” 

I shook my head, thoughtful- 
like. “Ain’t the way I see it.” 

“Go ahead,” he sighed. “Let’s 
hear your theory. No reason you 
should be an exception.” 

“I think Stinky’s got a kind of 
mental green thumb for ma- 
chines,” I said. “Like some people 
got green thumbs for plants, only 
he’s got—” 

30 



The colonel took a long, hard 
frown at me. Then he nodded 
very slowly. “I see what you 
mean. Those new parts weren’t 
moved in or around. They were 
grown” 

“Something like that. Maybe 
he can make a machine come 
kind of alive and improve itself, 
grow parts that'll make it a bet- 
ter and happier and more efficient 
machine.” 

“Sounds silly when you say it,” 
the colonel said, “but it makes a 
lot more sense than any of the 
other ideas. Man’s been working 
with machines — real machines, 
that is — only a century or two. 
Make that ten thousand or a mil- 
lion years and it might not seem 
so silly.” 

We sat in silence while the 
twilight crept into the room and I 
think the both of us must have 
been thinking the same thing. 
Thinking of the black night that 
lay out beyond Earth and of how 
Stinky must have crossed it And 
wondering, too, about what kind 
of world he came from and why 
he might have left it and what 
happened to him out in the long 
dark that forced him to look for 
asylum on Earth. 

Thinking, too, I guess, about 
the ironic circumstance that had 
cast him on a planet where his 
nearest counterpart was a little 
animal that no cared to have 
much to do with. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




« W HAT I can’t understand,” 
the colonel said, “is why 
he does it. Why does he do it for 
us?” 

“He doesn’t do it for us,” I an- 
swered. “He does it for the planes. 
He feels sorry for them.” 

The door burst open and the 
general came tramping in. He 
was triumphant. Dusk had crept 
into the room and I don’t think 
he saw me. 

“We got an okay!” he gloated. 
*The ship will be in tomorrow. 
The Pentagon agrees!” 

“General,” said the colonel, 
“we’re pushing this too hard. It’s 
time for us to begin to lay some 
sort of grounds for basic under- 
standing. We’ve grabbed what we 
can grab the quickest. We’ve ex- 
ploited this little cuss right up to 
the hilt. We have a lot of data — ” 
“Not all we need!” the general 
bellowed. “What we have been 
doing has been just sort of prac- 
tice. We have no data on the A- 
ship. That is where we need it.” 
“What we need as well is an 
understanding of this creature. 
An understanding of how he does 
it. If we could talk to him — ” 
“Talk!” the general shouted. 
“Yes, talk!” the colonel shouted 
back. “He keeps purring all the 
time. That may be his means of 
communication. The men who 
found him simply whistled and 
he came. That was communica- 
tion. If we had a little patience — ” 



“We have no time for patience, 
Colonel.” 

“General, we can’t simply wring 
him dry. He’s done a lot for us. 
Let’s give the little guy a break. 
He’s the one who has had the pa- 
tience-waiting for us to com- 
municate with him, hoping that 
someday we’ll recognize him for 
what he is!” 

They were yelling at one an- 
other and the colonel must have 
forgotten I was there. It was em- 
barrassing. I held out my arms to 
Stinky and he jumped into them. 
I tiptoed across the room and 
went out as quietly as I could. 

That night, I lay in bed with 
Stinky curled up on the covers at 
my feet. The four guards sat in 
the room, quiet as watchful mice. 

I thought about what the colo- 
nel had said to the general and 
my heart went out to Stinky. I 
thought how awful it would be if 
a man suddenly was dumped into 
a world of skunks who didn’t care 
a rap about him except that he 
could dig the deepest and slick- 
est burrows that skunks had ever 
seen and that he could dig them 
quick. And there were so many 
burrows to be dug that not one of 
the skunks would take the time to 
understand this man, to try to 
talk with him or to help him out. 

I lay there feeling sorry and 
wishing there was something I 
could do. Then Stinky came 
walking up the covers and 



OPERATION STINKY 



31 




crawled in under them with me 
and I put out my hand and held 
him tight against me while he 
purred softly at me. And that is 
how we went to sleep. 

r | 1 HE next afternoon, the A-ship 
arrived. The last of three that 
had been built, it was still experi- 
mental. It was a monster and we 
stood far back behind a line of 
guards and watched it come 
mushing down, settling base-first 
into the water-filled rocket pit 
they’d dug out on the runway. 
Finally it was down and it stood 
there, a bleak, squat thing that 
somehow touched one with awe 
just to look at it. 

The crew came down the lad- 
der and the launch went out to 
get them. They were a bunch of 
cocky youngsters and you could 
sense the pride in them. 

Next morning, we went out to 
the ship. I rode in the launch 
with the general and the colonel, 
and while the boat bobbed against 
the ladder, they had another dif- 
ference of opinion. 

“I still think it’s too risky, 
General,” said the colonel. “It’s 
all right to fool around with jets, 
but an atomic ship is a different 
matter. If Stinky goes fooling 
with that pile—” 

The general said, tight-lipped: 
“We have to take the chance.” 
The colonel shrugged and went 
up the ladder. The general mo- 



tioned to me and I went up with 
Stinky perched on my shoulder. 
The general followed. 

Whereas Stinky and I before 
this had been in a ship alone, this 
time a picked crew of technicians 
came aboard as well. There was 
plenty of room and it was the 
only way they could study what 
Stinky might be doing. And I 
imagined that, with an A-ship, 
the’d want to keep close check. 

I sat down in the pilot’s chair 
and Stinky settled himself in my 
lap. The colonel stayed with us 
for a while, but after a time he 
left and we were alone. 

I was nervous. What the colo- 
nel had said made good sense 
to me. But the day wore on and 
nothing happened and I began to 
feel that perhaps the colonel had 
been wrong. 

It went on for four days like 
that and I settled into routine. I 
wasn’t nervous any longer. We 
could depend on Stinky, I told 
myself. He wouldn’t do anything 
to harm us. 

By the way the technicians 
were behaving and the grin the 
general wore, I knew that Stinky 
must be performing up to expec- 
tations. 

On the fifth day, as we were 
going out, the colonel said: “This 
should wind it up.” 

I was glad to hear it. 

We were almost ready to 
knock off for noon when it hap- 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




pened. I can’t tell you exactly 
how it was, for it was a bit con- 
fusing. It was almost as if some- 
one had shouted, although no one 
had. I half rose out of the chair, 
then sat back again. And some- 
one shouted once more. 

T KNEW that something was 
about to happen. I could feel 
it in my bones. I knew I had to 
get out of the A-ship and get out 
fast. It was fear — unreasoning 
fear. And over and above the 
fear, I knew I could not leave. It 
was my job to stay. I had to stick 
it out. I grabbed the chair arms 
and hung on and tried my best 
to stay. 

Then the panic hit me and 
there was nothing I could do. 
There was no way to fight it. I 
leaped out of the chair, dumping 
Stinky from my lap. I reached 
the door and fought it open, then 
turned back. 

“Stinky!” I shouted. 

I started across the room to 
reach him, but halfway across, 
the panic hit me again and I 
turned and bolted in blind flight. 

I went clattering down the cat- 
walk and from below me came 
the sound of running and the 
yells of frightened men. I knew 
then that I had been right, that I 
had not been cowardly altogether 
— there was something wrong. 

Men were pouring out of the 
port of the big A-ship when I got 



there and scrambling down the 
ladder. The launch was coming 
out to pick them up. One man 
fell off the ladder into the water 
and began to swim. 

Out on the field, ambulances 
and fire rigs were racing toward 
the water pit and the siren atop 
the operations building was wail- 
ing like a stepped-on tomcat. 

I looked at the faces around 
me. They were set and white and 
I knew that all the men were just 
as scared as I was and somehow, 
instead of getting scareder, I got 
a lot of comfort from it. 

They went on tumbling down 
the ladder and more men fell in 
the drink, and I have no doubt at 
all that if someone had held a 
stopwatch on them, there’d have 
been swimming records falling. 

I got in line to wait my turn 
and I thought again of Stinky 
and stepped out of line and 
started back to save him. But 
halfway up the catwalk, my cour- 
age ran plumb out and I was too 
scared to go on. The funny thing 
about it was that I didn’t have 
the least idea what there was to 
scare me. 

I went down the ladder among 
the last of them and piled into 
the launch, which was loaded so 
heavily that it barely crept back 
to solid ground. 

The medical officer was run- 
ning around and shouting to get 
the swimmers into decontamina- 

34 



tion and men were running every- 
where and shouting and the fire 
rigs stood there racing their mo- 
tors while the siren went on 
shrieking. 

“Get back!” someone was shout- 
ing. “Run! Everybody back!” 

So, of course, we ran like a 
flock of spooked sheep. 

Then a wordless yell went up 
and we turned around. 

The atomic ship was rising 
slowly from the pit. Beneath it, 
the water seethed and boiled. The 
ship rose steadily, gracefully, 
without a single shudder or shake. 
It went straight up into the sky, 
up and out of sight. 

SUDDENLY I realized that I 
^ was standing in dead silence. 
No one was stirring. No one was 
making any noise. Everybody just 
stood and stared into the sky. 
The siren had shut off. 

I felt someone tap me on the 
shoulder. It was the general. 

“Stinky?” he asked. 

“He wouldn’t come,” I an- 
swered, feeling low. “I was too 
scared to go and get him.” 

The general wheeled and 
headed off across the field. For 
no reason I can think of, I turned 
and followed him. He broke into 
a run and I loped along beside 
him. 

We stormed into operations 
and went piling up the stairs to 
the tracking room. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The general bellowed: “You 
got a fix on it?” 

“Yes, sir, we’re tracking it right 
now.” 

“Good,” the general said, 
breathing heavily. “Fine. We’ll 
have to run it down. Tell me 
where it’s headed.” 

“Straight out, sir. It still is 
heading out.” 

“How far?” 

“About five thousand miles, 
sir” 

“But it can’t do that!” the gen- 
eral roared. “It can’t navigate in 
space!” 

He turned around and bumped 
into me. 

“Get out of my way!” He went 
thumping down the stairs. 

I followed him down, but out- 
side the building I went another 
way. I passed administration and 
there was the colonel standing 
outside. I wasn’t going to stop, 
but he called to me. I went over. 

“He made it,” said the colonel. 

“I tried to take him off,” I 
said, “but he wouldn’t come.” 

“Of course not. What do you 
think it was that drove us from 
the ship?” 

I thought back and there was 
only one answer. “Stinky?” 

“Sure. It wasn’t only machines, 
Asa, though he did wait till he got 
hold of something like the A-ship 
that he could make go out into 
space. But he had to get us off 
it first, so he threw us off.” 



I did some thinking about that, 
too. “Then he was kind of like a 
skunk.” 

“How do you mean?” asked the 
colonel, squinting at me. 

“I never did get used to calling 
him Stinky. Never seemed right 
somehow, him not having a smell 
and still having that name. But 
he did have a smell — a mental 
one, I guess you’d say — enough 
to drive us right out of the ship.” 

The colonel nodded. “All the • 
same, I’m glad he made it.” He 
stared up at the sky. 

“So am I,” I said. 

Although I was a little sore at 
Stinky as well. He could have 
said good-by at least to me. I was 
the best friend he had on Earth 
and driving me out along with 
the other men seemed plain rude. 

But now I’m not so sure. 

I still don’t know which end of 
a wrench to take hold of, but I 
have a new car now — bought it 
with the money I earned at the 
air base — and it can run all by 
itself. On quiet country roads, 
that is. It gets jittery in traffic. 
It’s not half as good as Betsy. 

I could fix that, all right. I 
found out when the car rose right 
over a fallen tree in the road. 
With what rubbed off on me from 
being with Stinky all that time, I 
could make it fly. But I won’t I 
ain't aiming to get treated the 
way Stinky was.

OPERATION STINKY 




Man in the Jar 

By DAMON KNIGHT 

Vane did not indiscriminately 

bottle live people he had to 

have a sound business reasonl 



T HE hotel room on the 
planet Meng was small 
and crowded. Blue-tinged 
sunlight from the window fell on 
a soiled gray carpet, a massive 
sandbox dotted with cigarette 
butts, a clutter of bottles. One 
corner of the room was piled high 
with baggage and curios. The oc- 
cupant, a Mr. R. C. Vane of 
Earth, was sitting near the door: 
a man about fifty, clean-shaven, 
with bristling iron-gray hair. He 
was soberly, murderously drunk. 

There was a tap on the door 
and the bellhop slipped in — a na- 



tive, tall and brown, with green- 
ish black hair cut too long in the 
back. He looked about nineteen. 
He had one green eye and one 
blue. 

“Set it there,” said Vane. 

The bellhop put his tray down. 
“Yes, sir” He took the unopened 
bottle of Ten Star off the tray, 
and the ice bucket, and the 
seltzer bottle, crowding them in 
carefully among the things al- 
ready on the table. Then he put 
the empty bottles and the ice 
bucket back on the tray. His 
hands were big and knob-jointed;

he seemed too long and wide- 
shouldered for his tight green 
uniform. 

“So this is Meng City,” said 
Vane, watching the bellhop. 

\ T ANE was sitting erect and un- 
* rumpled in his chair, with his 
striped moth-wing jacket on and 
his string tie tied. He might have 
been sober, except for the delib- 
erate way he spoke and the red- 
ness of his eyes. 

“Yes, sir,” said the bellhop, 
straightening up with the tray in 
his hands. “This your first time 
here, sir?” 

“I came through two weeks 
ago,” Vane told him. “I did not 
like it then and I do not like it 
now. Also, I do not like this 
room.” 

“Management is sorry if you 
don’t like the room, sir. Very 
good view from this room.” 

“It’s dirty and small,” said 
Vane, “but it doesn’t matter. I’m 
checking out this afternoon. Leav- 
ing on the afternoon rocket. I 
wasted two weeks upcountry, in- 
vestigating Marack stories. Noth- 
ing to it — just native talk. Miser- 
able little planet.” He sniffed, 
eying the bellhop. “What’s your 
name, boy?” 

“Jimmy Rocksha, sir.” 

“Well, Jimmy Rocks, look at 
that pile of stuff.” Tourist goods, 
scarves and tapestries, rugs, blan- 
kets and other things were heaped 



over the piled suitcases. It looked 
like an explosion in a curio shop. 
“There’s about forty pounds of it 
I have no room for, not counting 
that knocked-down jar. Any sug- 
gestions?” 

The bellhop thought about it 
slowly. “Sir, if I might suggest, 
you could put the scarves and 
things inside the jar. I think 
they’ll fit.” 

Vane said grudgingly, “That 
might work. You know how to put 
those jars together?” 

“I don’t know, sir.” 

“Well, let’s see you try. Go on, 
don’t stand there” Vane swirled 
his warm, flat drink. 

The bellhop set his tray down 
again and crossed the room. A big 
bundle of gray pottery pieces, 
tied together with twine, had 
been stowed on top of Vane’s 
wardrobe trunk, a little above the 
bellhop’s head. Roksha carefully 
removed his shoes and climbed 
on a chair. His brown feet were 
bare and clean. He lifted the bun- 
dle without effort, got down, set 
the bundle on the floor and put 
his shoes back on. 

Vane took a long swallow of 
his lukewarm highball, finishing 
it. He closed his eyes while he 
drank and nodded over the glass 
for a moment afterward, as if lis- 
tening to something whispering 
inside him. 

“All right,” he said, getting up, 
“let us see.” 



MAN IN THE JA

'T'HE bellhop loosened the 
-*■ twine. There were six long, 
thick, curving pieces, shaped a 
little like giant shoehorns. Then 
there were two round ones. One 
was bigger; that was the bottom. 
The other had a handle; that was 
the lid. The bellhop began to 
separate the pieces carefully, lay- 
ing them out on the carpet. 

“Watch out how you touch 
those together,” Vane grunted, 
coming up behind him. “I 
wouldn’t know how to get them 
apart again.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“That’s an antique I got up- 
country. They used to be used 
for storing grain and oil. The na- 
tives claim the Maracks had the 
secret of making them stick the 
way they do. Ever heard that?” 

“Upcountry boys tell a lot of 
fine stories, sir,” said the bellhop. 
He had the six long pieces ar- 
ranged, well separated, in a kind 
of petal pattern around the big 
flat piece. They took up most of 
the free space; the jar would be 
chest-high if it could be assem- 
bled. 

Standing up, the bellhop took 
two of the long curved pieces and 
carefully brought the edges closer 
together. They seemed to jump 
the last fraction of an inch, like 
magnets, and merged into one 
smooth piece. Peering, Vane could 
barely make out the join. 

In the same way, the bellhop 

38 



added another piece to the first 
two. Now he had half the jar as- 
sembled. Carefully, he lowered 
this half jar toward the edge of 
the big flat piece. The pieces 
clicked together. The bellhop 
stooped for another side piece. 

“Hold on a minute,” said Vane 
suddenly. “Got an idea. Instead 
of putting that thing all together, 
then trying to stuff things into it, 
load the things in, then put the 
rest of the side on.” 

“Yes, sir.” The bellhop laid the 
piece of crockery down again and 
picked up some light blankets, 
which he dropped on the bottom 
of the jar. 

“Not that way, dummy,” said 
Vane impatiently. “Get in there 
— pack them down tight.” 

The bellhop hesitated. “Yes, 
sir.” He stepped delicately over 
the remaining unassembled pieces 
and knelt on the bottom of the 
jar, rolling the blankets and 
pressing them snugly in. 

Behind him, Vane moved on 
tiptoe, putting two long pieces si- 
lently together — tic ! — then a 
third — tic! — and then as he lifted 
them, tic, clack! the sides melted 
into the bottom and the top. The 
jar was complete. 

The bellhop was inside. 

X/’ANE breathed hard through 
" flared nostrils. He took a cigar 
out of a green-lizard pocket case, 
cut it with a lapel knife and lit 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




it Exhaling smoke, he leaned 
over and looked down into the 
jar. 

Except for a moan of surprise 
when the jar closed, the bellhop 
had not made a sound. Looking 
down, Vane saw his brown face 
looking up. 

“Let me out of this jar, please, 
sir,” said the bellhop. 

“Can’t do that” Vane said. 
“They didn’t tell me how, up- 
country.* 

The bellhop moistened his lips. 
“Upcountry, they use a kind of 
tree grease. It creeps between the 
pieces and they fall apart.” 

“They didn’t give me anything 
like that,” said Vane indifferently. 

“Then please, sir, you break 
this jar and let me come out.” 

Vane picked a bit of tobacco off 
his tongue. He looked at it curi- 
ously and then flicked it away. “I 
spotted you in the lobby the min- 
ute I came in this morning. Tall 
and thin. Too strong for a native. 
One green eye, one blue. Two 
weeks I spent upcountry, looking 
— and there you were in the 
lobby” 

“Sir?” 

“You’re a Marack,” said Vane 
flatly. 

The bellhop did not answer for 
a moment. “But, sir,” he said in- 
credulously, “Maracks are leg- 
ends, sir. Nobody believes that 
any more. There are no Maracks.” 

“You lifted that jar down like 



nothing,” said Vane, “though it 
took two boys to put it up there. 
You’ve got the hollow temples. 
You’ve got the long jaw and the 
hunched shoulders.” Frowning, he 
took a billfold out of his pocket 
and took out a yellowed card. He 
showed it to the bellhop. “Look at 
that picture. I hope,” he added, “it 
won’t upset you. Might be a rela- 
tive of yours.” 

It was a faded photograph of a 
skeleton in a glass case. There 
was something disturbing about 
the skeleton. It was too long and 
thin; the shoulders seemed 
hunched and the skull was narrow 
and hollow-templed. Under it the 
printing said, “ABORIGINE OF 
NEW CLEVELAND, MENG 
(SIGMA LYRA II)” and in 
smaller letters, “Newbold Anthro- 
pological Museum, Ten Eyck, 
Queensland, N. T. Courtesy of 
Estate of Walter B. Soong.” 

“Found it between the pages of 
a book two hundred years old,” 
said Vane, carefully putting it 
back. “It was mailed as a postcard 
to an ancestor of mine. A year 
later, I happened to be on Nova 
Terra. Now get this— the museum 
is still there, but that skeleton is 
not! They deny it ever was there. 
Curator seemed to think it was a 
fake. None of the native races on 
Meng have skeletons like that, he 
said.” 

“Must be a fake, sir,” the bell- 
hop agreed.

WILL tell you what I did 
next,” Vane went on. “I read 
all the contemporary accounts I 
could find of frontier days on 
this planet. A couple of centuries 
ago, nobody on Meng thought 
the Maracks were legends. They 
looked enough like the natives to 
pass, but they had certain special 
powers. They could turn one 
thing into another. They could in- 
fluence your mind, if you weren’t 
on your guard against them. I 
next read all the export records 
back to a couple of centuries ago. 
Also the geological charts in Plan- 
etary Survey. I discovered some- 
thing. It just happens that there 
is no source of natural diamonds 
anywhere on Meng.” 

“No, sir?” asked the bellhop 
nervously. 

“Not one. No diamonds and no 
place where they ever could have 
been mined. But until two hun- 
dred years ago, Meng exported 
one billion stellors’ worth of flaw- 
less diamonds every year. I ask, 
where did they come from? And 
why did they stop?” 

“I don’t know, sir.” 

“The Maracks made them,” 
Vane said bluntly. “For a trader 
named Soong and his family. 
They died. After that, no more 
diamonds from Meng.” 

He opened a suitcase, rum- 
maged inside it a moment and 
took out two objects. One was a 
narrow oval bundle of something 



wrapped in stiff yellow plant fi- 
bers; the other was a shiny gray- 
black lump half the size of his fist. 

“Do you know what this is?” 
Vane asked, holding up the oval 
bundle. 

“No, sir.” 

“Air weed, they call it upcoun- 
try. One of the old men had this 
one buried under his hut, along 
with the jar. And this.” He held 
up the black lump. “Nothing spe- 
cial about it, would you say? Just 
a piece of graphite, probably from 
the old mine at Badlong. But 
graphite is pure carbon. And so 
is a diamond.” 

He put both objects carefully 
down on the nearby table and 
wiped his hands. The graphite 
had left black smudges on them. 

“Think about it,” he said. 
“You’ve got exactly one hour, till 
three o’clock.” Delicately, he 
tapped his cigar over the mouth 
of the jar. A few flakes of pow- 
dery ash floated down on the 
bellhop’s upturned face. 

Vane went back to his chair. 
He moved deliberately and a lit- 
tle stiffly, but did not stagger. He 
peeled the foil off the bottle of 
Ten Star. He poured himself a 
substantial drink, added ice, 
splashed a little seltzer in. He 
took a long, slow swallow. 

“Sir,” said the bellhop finally, 
“you know I can’t make any dia- 
monds out of black rock. What’s 
going to happen when it comes 



MAN IN THE JAR 



41 




three o’clock and that rock is still 
just a piece of rock?” 

“I think,” Vane answered, “I 
will just take the wrappings off 
that air weed and drop it in the 
jar with you. Air weed, I am told, 
will expand to hundreds of times 
its volume in air. When it fills the 
jar to the brim, I will put the lid 
on. And when we’re crossing that 
causeway to the spaceport, I 
think you may get tipped off the 
packrat into the bay. The bottom 
is deep silt, they tell me.” 

He took another long, unhur- 
ried swallow. 

“Think about it,” he said, star- 
ing at the jar with red eyes. 

TfT’ITHIN the jar, it was cool 
and dim. The bellhop had 
enough room to sit fairly com- 
fortably with his legs crossed, or 
else he could kneel, but then his 
face came right up to the mouth 
of the jar. The opening was too 
small for his head. He could not 
straighten up any farther or put 
his legs out. The bellhop was 
afraid and was sweating in his 
tight uniform. He was only nine- 
teen and nothing like this had 
ever happened to him before. 

The clink of ice came from 
across the room. The bellhop said, 
“Sir?” 

The chair springs whined and, 
after a moment, the Earthman’s 
face appeared over the mouth of 
the jar. His chin was dimpled. 



There were gray hairs in his nos- 
trils and a few gray and black 
bristles in the creases of loose 
skin around his jaw. His red eyes 
were hooded and small. He looked 
down into the bellhop’s face with- 
out speaking. 

“Sir,” the bellhop said ear- 
nestly, “do you know how much 
they pay me here at this hotel?” 

“No.” 

“Twelve stellors a week, sir, 
and my meals. If I could make 
diamonds, sir, why would I be 
working here?” 

Vane’s expression did not 
change. “Ask me a hard one. 
Soong had to sweat you Maracks 
to get a billion stellors a year. 
There used to be thousands of 
you on this continent alone, but 
now there are so few that you can 
disappear among the natives. The 
diamonds took too much out of 
you. You’re close to extinction 
now. And you’re all scared. You’ve 
gone underground. You’ve still 
got your powers, but you don’t 
dare use them — unless there’s no 
other way to keep your secret. 
You were lords of this planet 
once, but you’d rather stay alive. 
Of course, all this is merely guess- 
work.” 

“Yes, sir,” said the bellhop de- 
spairingly. 

The house phone rang. Vane 
crossed the room and thumbed 
the key down, watching the bell- 
hop from the comer of his eye. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“What is it?” he said, flat-voiced. 

“Mr. Vane,” said the voice of 
the desk clerk, “if I may ask, did 
the refreshments you ordered ar- 
rive?” 

“The bottle came,” Vane an- 
swered. “Why?” 

The bellhop was listening, ball- 
ing his fists on his knees. Sweat 
stood out on his brown forehead. 

“Oh, nothing really, Mr. Vane, 
only the boy did not come back. 
He is usually very reliable, Mr. 
Vane. But excuse me for trou- 
bling you.” 

“No trouble,” said Vane stonily, 
and turned the phone off. 

He came back to the jar. He 
swayed a little, rocking back and 
forth from heels to toes. In one 
hand he had the highball glass; 
with the other he was playing 
with the little osmiridium knife 
that hung by an expanding chain 
from his lapel. 

After a while, he said, “Why 
didn’t you call for help?” 

THHE bellhop did not answer. 

Vane went on softly, “Those 
hotel phones will pick up a voice 
across the room. I know that. So 
why were you quiet?” 

The bellhop said unhappily, “If 
I did yell, sir, they would find me 
in this jar.” 

“What of it?” 

The bellhop grimaced. “There’s 
some other people that still be- 
lieve in Maracks, sir. I have to be 



careful about my eyes. They 
would know there coyld only be 
the one reason why you would 
treat me like this.” 

Vane studied him for a mo- 
ment. “And you’d take a chance 
on the air weed, and the bay, just 
to keep anyone from finding out?” 
“It’s a long time since we had 
any Marack hunts on this planet, 
sir.” 

Vane snorted softly. He glanced 
up at the wall clock. “Forty min- 
utes,” he said, and went back to 
his chair by the door. 

The room was silent except for 
the faint whir of the clock. After a 
while, Vane moved to the writing 
desk. He put a printed customs 
declaration form in the machine 
and began tapping keys slowly, 
muttering over the complicated 
Interstellar symbols. 

“Sir,” said the bellhop quietly, 
“you know you can’t kill a biped 
person and just get away. This is 
not like the bad old times.” 
Vane grunted, tapping keys. 
“Think not?” He took a sip from 
his highball and set it down again. 

“Even if they find out you have 
mistreated the headman upcoun- 
try, sir, they will be very severe.” 
“They won’t find out,” Vane 
said. “Not from him.” 

“Sir, even if I could make you 
your diamond, it would only be 
worth of few thousand stellors. 
That is nothing to a man like 
you.” 



MAN IN THE JAR 



43 




Vane paused and half turned. 
“Flawless, that weight, it would be 
worth a hundred thousand. But 
I’m not going to sell it.” He 
turned back to the machine, fin- 
ished a line and started to tap 
out another. 

“No, sir?” 

“No. Tm going to keep it.” 
Vane’s eyes half closed; his fin- 
gers poised motionless on the 
keys. He seemed to come to him- 
self with a start, hit another key 
and rolled the paper out of the 
machine. He picked up an enve- 
lope and rose, looking over the 
paper in his hand. 

“Just to keep it, sir, and look at 
it now and then?” the bellhop 
asked softly. Sweat was running 
down into his eyes, but he kept 
his fists motionless on his knees. 

“That’s it,” said Vane, with the 
same faraway look. 

He folded the paper slowly and 
put it into the envelope as he 
walked toward the message chute 
near the door. At the last moment, 
he checked himself, snapped the 
paper open again and stared at it. 
A slow flush came to his cheeks. 

Crumpling the paper slowly in 
his hands, he said, “That almost 
worked.” 

XT E TORE the paper across de- 
liberately, and then again, 
and again, before he threw the 
pieces away. 

“Just one symbol in the wrong 



box, ” he said, “but it was the right 
wrong symbol. I’ll tell you where 
you made your mistake, though, 

boy. ” He came closer. 

“I don’t understand,” said the 
bellhop. 

“You thought if you could get 
me to thinking about that dia- 
mond, my mind would wander. It 
did — but I knew what was hap- 
pening. Here’s where you made 
your mistake : I don't give a damn 
about that diamond .” 

“Sir?” asked the bellhop in be- 
wilderment 

“A stellor to you is a new pair 
of pants. A stellor to me, or a 
thousand stellors, is just raw ma- 
terial for business deals. That’s 
what counts. I’d offer you money, 
but you explained yourself why 
you can’t be bought — you could 
make diamonds and be rich, but 
you don’t dare. That’s why I have 
to use this method.” 

“Sir, I don’t know what you 
mean.” 

“You know, all right. You’re 
getting a little dangerous now, 
aren’t you? You’re cornered and 
the time’s running out. So you 
took a little risk.” He stooped, 
picked up one of the scraps of 
paper, unfolded it and smoothed 
it out “Right here, in the box 
where the loyalty oath to the 
Archon is supposed to go, I wrote 
the symbol for ‘pig.’ If I sent that 
down, the thought police would 
be up here in fifteen minutes.” 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He balled up the paper again, 
into an even smaller wad, and 
dropped it on the carpet. 

“Think you can make me for- 
get to pick that up again and bum 
it, before I leave?” he asked ami- 
ably. “Try.” 

The bellhop swallowed hard. 
“Sir, you did that yourself. You 
made a slip of the finger.” 

Vane smiled at him for the first 
time and walked away. 

The bellhop put his back 
against the wall of the jar and 
pushed with all his strength 
against the opposite side. He 
pushed until the muscles of his 
back stood out in knotted ropes. 
The pottery walls were as solid as 
rock. 

He was sweating more than 
ever. He relaxed, breathing hard; 
he rested his head on his knees 
and tried to think. The bellhop 
had heard of ruthless Earthmen, 
but he had never seen one. 

He straightened up. “Sir, are 
you still there?” 

The chair creaked and Vane 
came over, glass in hand. 

“Sir,” said the bellhop ear- 
nestly, “if I can prove to you that 
I’m really not a Marack, will you 
let me go? I mean you’ll have to 
let me go then, won’t you?” 

“Why, certainly,” Vane said 
agreeably. “Go ahead and prove 
it.” 

“Well, sir, haven’t you heard 
other things about the Maracks — 



some other manner of test?” 
Vane looked thoughtful; he put 
his chin down on his chest and his 
eyes filmed over. 

“About what they can or can’t 
do?” the bellhop suggested. “If I 
tell you, sir, you might think I 
made it up.” 

“Wait a minute.” 

"Y^ANE was swaying slightly, 
* back and forth, his eyes half 
closed. His string tie was still per- 
fectly tied, his striped moth-wing 
jacket immaculate. He said, “I 
remember something. The Ma- 
rack hunters used this a good 
deal, I understand. Maracks can’t 
stand liquor. It poisons them.” 
“You’re positive about that, 
sir?” the bellhop said eagerly. 

“Of course I’m positive.” 

“All right then, sir!” 

Vane nodded and went to the 
table to get the bottle of Ten Star. 
It was still two-thirds full. He 
came back with it and said, “Open 
your mouth.” 

The bellhop opened his mouth 
wide and shut his eyes. The liquor 
hit his teeth and the back of his 
mouth in one solid splash; it 
poured down both cheeks and 
some of it ran up his nose. He 
choked and strangled. The liquor 
burned all the way down his 
throat and windpipe; tears blinded 
him; he couldn’t breathe. 

When the paroxysm was over, 
he gasped, “Sir — sir, that wasn’t a

fair test. You shouldn’t have 
poured it on me like that. Give 
me a little bit, in a glass.” 

“Now I want to be fair. We’ll 
try it again.” Vane found an 
empty glass, poured two fingers 
of brandy into it and came back. 
“Easy does it,” he said, and 
trickled a little into the bellhop’s 
mouth. 

The bellhop swallowed, his 
head swimming in brandy fumes. 

“Once more,” said Vane, and 
poured again. 

The bellhop swallowed. The 
liquor was gathering in a ball of 
heat inside him. 

“Again.” 

He swallowed. 

Vane stood back. The bellhop 
opened his eyes and looked bliss- 
fully up at him. “You see, sir? No 
poison. I drank it and I’m not 
dead!” 

“Hmm,” said Vane with an in- 
terested expression. “Well, imag- 
ine that. Maracks can drink liq- 
uor.” 

The bellhop’s victorious smile 
slowly faded. “Sir, please don’t 
joke with me.” 

“If you think it’s a joke—” 

“Sir, you promised .” 

“I said yes — if you could prove 
to me that you are not a Marack. 
Go ahead, prove it. Here’s another 
little test for you, incidentally. An 
anatomist I know looked at that 
skeleton and told me it was so 
constricted at the shoulders that 



a Marack can’t lift his hand 
higher than his head. All right, 
begin by telling me why you 
stood on a chair to get my bundle 
down — or better yet, just put 
your arm out the neck of that 
jar.” 

There was a silence. Vane took 
another cigar out of the green- 
lizard case, cut it with the little 
osmiridium knife and lit it with- 
out taking his eyes off the bellhop. 

“Now you’re getting dangerous 
again,” he said with enjoyment. 
“You’re thinking it over. This be- 
gins to get interesting. You’re 
wondering how you can kill me 
from inside that jar, without us- 
ing your Marack powers. Go on, 
think about it.” 

He breathed smoke, leaning to- 
ward the jar. “You’ve got fifteen 
minutes.” 

ORKING without haste, 

Vane rolled up all the blan- 
kets and other souvenirs and 
strapped them into bundles. He 
removed some toilet articles from 
the dresser and packed them 
away in his grip. He took a last 
look around the room, saw the 
paper scraps on the floor and 
picked up the tiny pellet he had 
made of one of them. He showed 
it to the bellhop with a grin, then 
dropped it into the ash-receiver 
and burned it. He sat down com- 
fortably in the chair near the 
door.

“Five minutes,” he said. 

“Four minutes,” he said. 

“Three minutes.” 

“Two minutes.” 

“All right,” said the bellhop. 

“Yes?” Vane got up and stood 
over the jar. 

“I’ll do it — I’ll make the dia- 
mond.” 

“Ahh?” said Vane, half ques- 
tioningly. He picked up the lump 
of graphite and held it out. 

“I don’t need to touch it,” the 
bellhop said listlesly. “Just put it 
down on the table. It will take 
about a minute.” 

“Umm,” said Vane, watching 
him keenly. The bellhop was 
crouched in the jar, eyes closed; 
all Vane could see of him was the 
glossy green-black top of his head. 

“If you just hadn’t had that air 
weed,” the bellhop said sullenly, 
his voice muffled. 

Vane laughed. “I didn’t need 
the air weed. I could have taken 
care of you in a dozen ways. This 
knife—” he held it up — “has a 
molecular-vibration blade. Turn it 
on, it’ll cut through anything, like 
cheese. I could have minced you 
up and floated you down the 
drain.” 

The bellhop’s face turned up, 
pale and wide-eyed. 

“No time for that now, though,” 
Vane said. “It would have to be 
the air weed.” 

“Is that how you’re going to 
get me loose, afterward?” the bell- 



hop asked. “Cut the jar with that 
knife?” 

“Mm? Oh, certainly,” said Vane, 
watching the graphite lump. Was 
there a change in its appearance 
or not? 

“I’m disappointed, in a way,” 
he said abstractedly. “I thought 
you’d give me a fight. You Ma- 
racks are overrated, I suppose.” 
“It’s all done,” said the bellhop. 
“Take it, please, and let me out.” 
Vane’s eyes narrowed. “It 
doesn’t look done, to me.” 

“It only looks black on the out- 
side, sir. Just rub it off.” 

Vane did not move. 

“Go ahead, sir,” said the bell- 
hop urgently. “Pick it up and see.” 
“You’re a little too eager,” Vane 
said. 

He took a fountain pen out of 
his pocket and used it to prod the 
graphite gingerly. Nothing hap- 
pened; the lump moved freely 
across the tabletop. Vane touched 
it briefly with one finger, then 
picked it up in his hand. 

“No tricks?” he said quizzically. 
He felt the lump, weighed it, 
put it down again. There were 
black graphite smears in his palm. 

'li7 r ANE opened his lapel knife 
^ and cut the graphite lump 
down the middle. It fell into two 
shiny black pieces. 

“Graphite,” said Vane, and with 
an angry gesture, he stuck the 
knife blade into the table. 



MAN IN THE JAR

He turned to the bellhop, dust- 
ing off his hands. “I don’t get 
you,” he said, prodding the oval 
bundle of the air weed experimen- 
tally. He picked it up. “All you 
did was stall. Disappointing.” 

The dry wrappings came apart 
in his hands. Between the fibers, 
a dirty-white bulge began to show. 

Vane lifted the package to drop 
it into the jar and saw that the 
bellhop’s scared face filled the 
opening. While he hesitated 
briefly, the gray-white floss of the 
air weed foamed slowly out over 
the back of his hand. Vane felt a 
constriction and instinctively tried 
to drop the bundle. He couldn’t. 
The growing, billowing floss was 
sticky — it stuck to his hand, then 
his sleeve. It grew, slowly, but 
with a horrifying steadiness. 

Gray-faced, Vane whipped his 
arm around, trying to shake off 
the weed. Like thick lather, the 
floss spattered downward but did 
not separate. A glob of it hit his 
trouser leg and clung. Another, 
swelling, dripped down to the car- 
pet. His whole right arm and side 
were covered deep under a mound 
of white. The floss had now 
stopped growing and seemed to 
be stiffening. 

The bellhop began to rock 
himself back and forth inside the 
jar. The jar tipped and fell back. 
The bellhop rocked harder. The 
jar was inching its way across the 
carpet. 



After a few moments, the bell- 
hop paused to put his face up and 
see which way he was going. 
Vane, held fast by the weed, was 
leaning toward the table, strain- 
ing hard, reaching with his one 
free hand toward the knife he 
had put there. The carpet bulged 
after him, but too much furniture 
was holding it. 

The bellhop lowered his head 
and rocked the jar again, harder. 
When he looked up, Vane’s eyes 
were closed tight, his face red 
with effort. He was extended as 
far as he could reach across the 
table, but his fingers were still 
clawing air an inch short of the 
knife. The bellhop rocked hard. 
The jar inched forward, came to 
rest solidly against the table, pin- 
ning Vane’s arm against it by the 
flaring sleeve. 

The bellhop relaxed and looked 
up. Feeling himself caught, the 
Earthman had stopped struggling 
and was looking down. He tugged, 
but could not pull the sleeve free. 

“Stalemate,” said Vane heavily. 
He showed his teeth to the bell- 
hop. “Close, but no prize. I can’t 
get at you. You can’t hurt me.” 

The bellhop’s head bowed as if 
in assent. But then his long arm 
came snaking up out of the jar. 
His fingers closed around the 
deadly little knife. 

“A Marack can lift his arm 
higher than his head,” he said.

perial request that Rabbi Judah 
Loew with companions of his 
choosing was to be at the Hrad- 
cany Castle on a specific date. 

The day was the 23rd of Feb- 
ruary, 1592, and Rabbi Loew 
went to the castle. He took with 
him his brother, Rabbi Sinai, and 
his son-in-law, Isak Kohen. At 
the castle, Rabbi Loew was 
brought into a room where Prince 
Bertier was waiting for him. The 
other two men were signaled to 
sit in a corner, some distance 
away. But, as Kohen reported 
later, the prince spoke very 
loudly and Rabbi Loew, presum- 
ably suspecting that the prince 
was hard of hearing, answered in 
an equally loud voice. The two 
witnesses could understand every 
word, even though they were in 
a far corner. 

All at once, the reason for the 
loud speaking became clear. One 
of the drapes parted and the em- 
peror himself appeared and joined 
in the conversation. 

These few facts and the date 
are all we know about the audi- 
ence. Probably everybody pres- 
ent had to vow secrecy. There is 
nothing about the discussion in 
the court’s records. Isak Kohen 
did not say a word beyond what 
has just been related. And the 
astronomer David Gans, a friend 
of Tycho Brahe, who had some 
dealings with Rabbi Loew, said 
that the rabbi himself also never 



mentioned a word about the 
meeting. 

My reason for telling all this 
is that High Rabbi Judah Loew 
of Prague is credited by legend 
with having made the first robot 
in history. 

T^HE topic came up for discus- 
sion on a hot day in summer, 
1956, when Fritz Lang was in 
New York and we were both sit- 
ting somewhat impatiently in his 
hotel room waiting for room serv- 
ice. The fact that we had to wait 
led to idle talk about liquor or- 
gans, the possibilities of mechan- 
nized room service. From there, it 
was only a short step to serving 
robots and Fritz Lang abruptly 
said: “Say, the golem must have 
been the first robot.” 

We tried to find an older one, 
but except for the magic head 
which Roger Bacon is supposed 
to have made and which burst 
into splinters after uttering one 
word or one sentence, we could 
not think of any. 

That golem we discussed was 
supposed to have been a man 
made of clay and endowed with 
a kind of pseudo-life by Rabbi 
Loew. The golem was able to 
hear, but it could not speak. It 
was not very bright, but intensely 
loyal. It never needed sleep, al- 
though it feigned sleep quite 
often, and had enormous strength. 
Fire or water did not harm it.

But there was one problem: it 
had been created by magic, which 
in itself was a sin. 

But the sin would be tolerated 
if it was only used for religious 
purposes. When somebody — the 
rabbi's wife was the first to make 
that mistake — issued an order for 
personal convenience or other 
secular matters, the golem would 
inevitably misperform. (The story 
of the endless water-carrying 
which we know as the basis of 
“sorcerer’s apprentice” was told 
about the golem.) 

Legend says that after the au- 
dience with Emperor Rudolph II, 
the rabbi declared, “We no longer 
need Jossele Golem,” and that he 
and another son-in-law of his 
named Jakob Katz and his pupil 
Jakob Sosson took the golem to 
the attic of the Altneu Syna- 
gogue in Prague and recited the 
requisite spells to take its pseudo- 
life away from it. 

In the legends that formed 
later — they have been collected 
several times — the audience with 
the emperor is taken to have 
ended the golem’s career. But 
from the strictly historical stand- 
point, it seems that this audience 
was, so to speak, the birthday of 
the golem. The fact that a rabbi 
was called to the emperor was 
such an unusual event that it had 
to have some very special signifi- 
cance. 

Well, every child in Prague 



and also elsewhere where Ger- 
man was spoken — it is a some- 
what strange fact that the legends 
hardly penetrated the language 
barrier; they remained restricted 
to Jewish and Christian German- 
speaking circles — had heard about 
the golem at one time, if only be- 
cause there is a reference to it in 
classical German literature. But 
the story that the “corpse” of the 
golem stayed in the attic of the 
Altneu Synagogue seemed to 
have been restricted to Prague, 
as a local legend. 

One who heard it, probably in 
early childhood, was a man 
named Egon Erwin Kisch, who 
became a famous journalist. But 
he never used the story journal- 
istically as long as he stayed in 
Prague. 

WfHEN the First World War 
** came, Kisch was drafted into 
the Austrian Army. He spent most 
of the year 1915 in the Carpa- 
thian Mountains. There he met a 
man who at first was as sullen as 
possible and did not wish to have 
any truck with soldiers, any kind 
of soldiers, no matter what their 
nationality, uniform or rank. 

But when he heard, one day, 
that Kisch had been bom in 
Prague and had lived there most 
of his life, he warmed up. Prague 
was the city he most wanted to 
go to. He wanted to see the grave 
of Rabbi Loew and worship in 

51

Fig. 1: Paul Wegener a* the Golem in a 
silent German picture of that title, made in 
the early 1920's 



the Altneu Synagogue. It turned 
out that he collected everything 
about the golem that came his 
way and he finally showed Kisch 
a manuscript he had bought from 
a traveling peddler. 

The manuscript alleged to tell 
what had happened to the golem 
after the rabbi had removed its 
pseudo-life. It told how the tem- 
ple servant of the Pinkas Syna- 
gogue (also in Prague), Abraham 
ben Secharja by name, ap- 
proached his opposite number in 
the Altneu Synagogue with the 
proposal to steal the dead golem. 
Abraham Chajim of the Altneu 
Synagogue was finally persuaded 
to cooperate, since Abraham Cha- 
jim learned that his son-in-law, 

52 



one Ascher Balbierer, knew for- 
mulas from the Sohar which 
would revive the golem. 

They allegedly brought the 
golem’s body to the basement of 
Balbierer’s house, but whatever 
they tried, nothing helped — the 
golem remained dead. 

Then an epidemic (diphtheria, 
in all likelihood, from the descrip- 
tion) came and two of the five 
children of Ascher Balbierer died. 
Whereupon the mother of the two 
dead children put her foot down, 
blaming the presence of the 
golem for the bereavement, and 
forced her husband and his 
friends to dispose of the clay 
figure. 

A soldier in the front lines has 
worries enough and Kisch tem- 
porarily forgot the whole story. 
But after the war, when he was 
back in Prague, he decided to 
satisfy his curiosity and sell a 
few articles in the process. He 
applied for permission to visit 
the attic of the Altneu Synagogue 
to look for the golem. Permission 
was refused. He pulled different 
strings. Permission was not re- 
fused this time; it was pointed 
out to him that there was no 
staircase from the interior of the 
synagogue to the attic. 

Well, how could one get in? 
Only by climbing the building 
from the outside on an iron lad- 
der which started some eight feet 
above the ground. But he couldn’t 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

do that. Nobody was permitted 
to do it. 



Fig. 3: The robot Brigitte is thirsty between 
takes. (This picture has never been pub- 
lished before) 

(Courtesy: Fritz Lang) 



S OME more activity on the part 
of a journalist with a well- 
known name finally made the per- 
mission come through. On a 
bright day, and with more audi- 
ence than Kisch wished for, he 
climbed the building and finally 
entered the attic. As he reported, 
the room was anything but 
gloomy and mysterious. Several 
large windows admitted much 
sunlight, and since the building 
was old and small, its a'ttic was 
not even above the roofs of other

th« picture of the tame name

buildings. The most medieval 
thing he saw was a small bat 
hanging upside down from a 
rafter, sound asleep. No golem. 

Then he traced the way de- 
scribed in the manuscript which 
the abductors of the golem were 
supposed to have walked, both 
when stealing it and when finally 
disposing of it. Yes, the streets 
were as the manuscript had told. 
But the final destination was a 
kind of dump where the golem 
could never have been found, pro- 
vided that it had existed and pro- 
vided that its clay body had 
lasted through 300 odd years of 
internment. 

Just to round out the story, 
Kisch checked on the graves in 
the Jewish cemetery. He knew 

54 



that Rabbi Loew's grave was 
there. He found those of his pu- 
pils. He even found the tomb- 
stone of Abraham ben Secharja, 
stating that he had died in 1602 
after serving his synagogue for 
30 years. 

Kisch wrote the story of his 
failure. It was published and his 
report on the golem was directly 
responsible for the conception of 
the robots. It was another Prague 
journalist, Karel Capek, who in- 
vented the term. Kisch was bi- 
lingual, but was writing in Ger- 
man. Capek was bilingual, too, 
but wrote in Czech. 

Whether the play R.U.R. ( Ros - 
sum’s Universal Robots ) was writ- 
ten originally in German or in 
Czech is something I don’t know. 
I saw a German version when it 
was new. Present science fiction 
fans, knowing that this play in- 
troduced an important concept 
into science fiction, seem to feel 
that it is one of the classical 
pieces written for the stage and 
long to see it performed. 

If they should have a chance 
to see it, they are almost certain 
to be disappointed. When first 
performed in Europe around 1922 
or 1923, it received bad notices. 
To make it worse, the panning 
was deserved. The play was talk- 
ative, “preachy,” stuffed with the 
falsest pathos that could be de- 
vised. But the term robot (de- 
rived from the root word robota, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

meaning “work”) has persisted. 

The movies, still silent, eyed 
the new concept, but decided first 
to bring the golem to the screen 
directly. It was made by a Ger- 
man firm in the early ’twenties 
(Fig. 1) and when I think back 
to it, I always have the feeling 
that it must have been made by 
Frit 2 Lang. Of course I know that 
he didn’t, but it was that type of 
picture and equally impressive, 
although my impression now — 
more than 30 years later — tends 
to be rather general and more 
than somewhat hazy. 

The movie differed from the 
legends mainly in the way the 
golem finds its end. In the movie 
version, the magic word is im- 
bedded in a capsule on its chest. 
Running wild, the golem refuses 
to have it removed. But wander- 
ing away from the city, the golem 
meets a child who offers it an 
apple. It picks the child up, and 
the child pulls the capsule from 
its chest. 

"DEFORE leaving the golem, I 
would like to add a linguistic 
remark. Eastern Jews tend to 
pronounce the name as “goylem” 
and have evolved “folk etymol- 
ogy” that the clay figure was 
called a “goy” (non- Jew) since it 
obviously was not Jewish. I 
checked with a dictionary — this 
piece of layman’s etymology is 
nonsense. The word golem is a 

56 




Fig. 7: Robby tbe Robot a* driver of a 
futuristic cor 

(Courtesy: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) 



genuine Hebrew word, meaning 
“the germ” or “the formless one” 
or, stretching the analogy to form- 
lessness a bit, “the fool.” 

I do not know when a robot 
appeared for the first time in a 
science fiction story. The first ro- 
bot on the screen was very pretty, 
bore the name of Brigitte Helm 
(a shortened version of her real 
name) and was the creation of 
Fritz Lang in Metropolis. Even 
though the armor had been made 
form-fitting (Figs. 2 and 3) as ac- 
curately and as light as possible, 
the poor girl could not wear it for 
long. 

Although labeled a creation of 
science rather than magic, in the 
film there were still plenty of 
mystical overtones and ground- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



swells. At least I have never seen 
a laboratory with a glowing pen- 
tagram on the wall; the real lab- 
oratories even avoid a picture of 
the Pentagon. 

A successful and therefore uni- 
versally known work of art of 
any description tends to monopo- 
lize a concept for quite a while. 
As I pointed out once, the fact 
that Giacomo Meyerbeer used 
the Tree of Death in the final 
scene of his opera VAlricaine pre- 
vented every other composer and 
librettist from doing the same. If 
anybody had used the Tree of 
Death, he would have been ac- 
cused of cribbing from Meyer- 
beer, even though he might not 
have known the opera and got- 
ten his theme directly from Eras- 
mus Darwin, who had publicized 
it in his Loves of the Plants. 

Similarly, the robot concept, 
sub-family movie robots, suffered 
the same fate because of Metrop- 
olis. 

However, the movies appar- 
ently felt that they had to do 
something along that line, with 
the result that an evil genius dug 
up the tale of Frankenstein and 
his monster. 

r I^HE original story had origi- 
nated in 1816 as one of the 
restilts of a literary discussion. 
The author of the original Frank- 
enstein , still Miss Mary Godwin 
at the time, the poet Shelley, who 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



was her future husband, the poet 
Lord Byron, Dr. John W. Poli- 
dori, and a few other people were 
all in Geneva and one day voted 
that everybody in the party 
should write a story of the super- 
natural. Not everybody who 
agreed to do so finished his story, 
but among the ones that were fin- 
ished was Frankenstein. 

The plot is about as simple as 
possible. Mr. Frankenstein, who 
has stumbled across the “secret of 
life,” uses raw material from 
graves and dissecting rooms to 
put an eight-foot-tall manlike 
thing together which, when it 
comes to life, frightens its own 
creator out of his wits, even 
though it is friendly and harm- 
less, merely too big and too ugly 
to be tolerable. 

It would be interesting if one 
could find out whether Mary 
Shelley had heard of the golem 
legend. It is possible because the 
German dramatist and novelist 
Clemens Brentano had written 
about it just at that time. There 
are some similarities. 

Many science fiction authors 
and readers make a distinction 
between robots and androids, 
while others say that there is no 
sharp borderline. Moreover, if 
one made that distinction, the ro- 
bots in Capek’s R. XJ. R. would 
be androids. Perfectly correct — 
they were. Capek naturally could 
not foresee what would happen 

57 




to the word he coined. Personally, 
I prefer to make the distinction 
and my preference is based, in 
part, on discussions with people 
outside of science fiction. 

These people tend to make a 
sharp distinction between “artifi- 
cial men” (androids) of whom 
they approve as part and parcel 
of “gothic” literature; and “me- 
chanical men” (robots) of whom 
they don’t approve. 

I find myself disliking androids, 
so I must be in favor of robots, 
where you can at least have an 
indicator light up when a gear 
slips. 

A SI said before, robots stayed 
off the screen for quite some 
time because of Metropolis, but 
they multiplied in print. And 
gradually they lost some of the 
human shape which had been a 
hangover from golem and Frank- 
enstein days. Some robots were 
angular merely because that was 
easier to build and also enabled 
everybody to tell a robot from a 
person at a glance. 

But it was then realized that 
the human shape is only highly 
versatile and not always the most 
efficient. Neither a robot switch- 
board operator nor a robot bar- 
tender needs legs to walk around, 
but both could do with a few 
extra sets of arms and hands. (In 
reality, of course, the whole 
mechanism would be internal, not 



even resembling human arms and 
hands.) 

The non-anthropoid robot took 
a long tirrte coming to the screen. 
If I am not mistaken, the two 
robots Gog and Magog in Ivan 
Tors’ Gog were the first. They 
were amusing, too, and even when 
they ran wild in the end, it wasn’t 
their fault; somebody had tam- 
pered with the main computer 
which issued orders to them. 

Of course the most charming of 
all robots is still in everybody’s 
memory; namely, Robbie in For- 
bidden Planet. Being an all-pur- 
pose robot, Robbie has the gen- 
eral shape of a human. He can 
drive, make coffee, produce bour- 
bon, carry tools and construction 
materials, and could even shoot it 
out with an enemy if a killable 
enemy were present. 

Naturally there will be more 
robots in more stories and, in all 
probability, other robots in other 
movies. 

There are also very real ro- 
bots appearing in industry in 
many places and for many pur- 
poses. 

And while I won’t dare to 
make the negative prophecy that 
the real industrial robots will 
never have a human shape, the 
majority of them will unquestion- 
ably look what they really are: 
cabinets full of electronic gear 
and programming tapes.

sugar, and then drinking the fool rock you to sleep if you pressed

had become completely accept- Farnsworth blushed and smiled.

He is a small, chubby man and 
blushes easily. “Thank you,” he 
said. “I have another new one. 
I call it a jelled vodka fizz — you 
eat it with a spoon. You may 
want to try it later. It’s — well — 
exceptional.” 

I suppressed a shudder at the 
thought of eating jelled vodka 
and said, “Interesting, very inter- 
esting,” and since he didn’t reply, 
we both stared at the fire for a 
while, letting the gin continue its 
pleasant work. Farnsworth’s bach- 
elor’s home was very comfortable 
and relaxing, and I always en- 
joyed my Wednesday night vis- 
its there thoroughly. I suppose 
most men have a deep-seated 
love for open fires and liquor — 
however fantastically prepared — 
and deep, comfortable leather 
armchairs. 

Then, after several minutes, 
Farnsworth abruptly bounced to 
his feet and said, “There’s a 
thing I wanted to show you. 
Made it last week. Didn’t pull it 
off too well, though.” 

“Really?” I said. Fd thought 
the drinks had been his usual 
weekly brainchild. They seemed 
quite enough. 

“Yes,” he said, trotting over to 
the door of the study. “It’s down- 
stairs in the shop. I’ll get it.” And 
he bounced out of the room, the 
paneled door closing as it had 
opened, automatically, behind 
him. 



¥ TURNED back to the fire 
A again, pleased that he had 
made something in the machine 
shop — the carpentry shop was in 
a shed in the backyard; the chem- 
istry and optical labs in the attic 
— for he was his most proficient 
with his lathe and milling ma- 
chines. His self-setting, variable- 
twist thumb bolt had been a 
beautiful piece of work and its 
patent had netted him, as had 
several other machined devices, a 
remarkable sum. 

He returned in a minute, car- 
rying a very odd-looking thing 
with him, and set it on the table 
beside my chair. I examined it 
silently for a minute while Farns- 
worth stood over me, half-smiling, 
his little green eyes wide, spar- 
kling in the reflected, flickering 
light from the fire. I knew he was 
suppressing his eagerness for my 
comment, but I was uncertain 
what to say. 

The thing, upon examination, 
appeared simple: a more or less 
cross-shaped construction of sev- 
eral dozen one-inch cubes, half 
of them of thin, transparent plas- 
tic, the other half made of thin 
little sheets of aluminum. Each 
cube seemed to be hinged to two 
others very cunningly and the ar- 
rangement of them all was some- 
what confusing. 

Finally, I said, “How many 
cubes?” I had tried to count 
them, but kept getting lost. 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Sixty-four,” he said. “I think.” 
“You think?” 

“Well — ” He seemed embar- 
rassed. “At least I made sixty- 
four cubes, thirty-two of each 
kind; but somehow I haven’t been 
able to count them since. They 
seem to . get lost, or shift 
around, or something.” 

“Oh?” I was becoming inter- 
ested. “May I pick it up?” 

“Certainly,” he said, and I took 
the affair, which was surpris- 
ingly lightweight, in my hands 
and began folding the cubes 
around on their hinges. I noticed 
then that some were open on 
one side and that certain others 
would fit into these if their hing- 
ing arrangements would allow 
them to. 

I began folding them absently 
and said, “You could count them 
by marking them one at a time. 
With a crayon, for instance.” 

“As a matter of fact,” he ad- 
mitted, blushing again, “I tried 
that. Didn’t seem to work out. 
When I finished, I found I had 
marked six cubes with the num- 
ber one and on none of them 
could I find, a two or three, al- 
though there were two fours, one 
of them written in reverse and 
in green.” He hesitated. “I had 
used a red marking pencil.” I saw 
him shudder slightly as he said 
it, although his voice had been 
casual-sounding enough. “I 
rubbed the numbers off with a 



damp cloth and didn’t ... try it 
again.” 

“Well,” I said. And then, “What 
do you call it?” 

“A pentaract.” 

TTE SAT back down again in 
his armchair. “Of course, 
that name really isn’t accurate. I 
suppose a pentaract should really 
be a four-dimensional pentagon, 
and this is meant to be a picture 
of a five-dimensional cube.” 

“A picture?” It didn’t look like 
a picture to me. 

“Well, it couldn’t really have 
five - dimensionality — length, 
width, breadth, ifth and oofth — 
or I don’t think it could.” His 
voice faltered a little at that. “But 
it’s supposed to illustrate what 
you might call the layout of an 
object that did have those.” 
“What kind of object would 
that be?” I looked back at the 
thing in my lap and was mildly 
surprised to see that I had folded 
a good many of the cubes to- 
gether. 

“Suppose,” he said, “you put a 
lot of points in a row, touching; 
you have a line — a one-dimen- 
sional figure. Put four lines to- 
gether at right angles and on a 
plane; a square — two-dimen- 
sional. Six squares at right angles 
and extended into real space give 
you a cube — three dimensions. 
And eight cubes extended into 
four physical dimensions give you

a tesseract, as it’s called—” 
“And eight tesseracts make a 
pentaract,” I said. “Five dimen- 
sions.” 

“Exactly. But naturally this is 
just a picture of a pentaract, in 
that sense. There probably isn’t 
any ifth and oofth at all.” 

“I still don’t know what you 
mean by a picture ” I said, push- 
ing the cubes around interestedly. 

“You don’t?” he asked, pursing 
his lips. “It’s rather awkward to 
explain, but . .. well, on the sur- 
face of a piece of paper, you can 
make a very realistic picture of a 
cube — you know, with perspec- 
tive and shading and all that kind 
of thing — and what you’d actu- 
ally be doing would be illustrat- 
ing a three-dimensional object, 
the cube, by using only two di- 
mensions to do it with.” 

“And of course,” I said, “you 
could fold the paper into a cube. 
Then you’d have a real cube.” 
He nodded. “But you’d have to 
use the third dimension — by fold- 
ing the flat paper up — to do it. 
So, unless I could fold my cubes 
up through ifth or oofth, my pen- 
taract will have to be just a poor 
picture. Or, really, eight pictures. 
Eight tesseracts, pictures of four- 
dimensional objects, stuck to- 
gether to make a picture of five 
dimensions.” 

“Well!” I said, a bit lost. “And 
what do you plan to use it for?” 
“Just curiosity.” And then, 

62 



abruptly, looking at me now, his 
eyes grew wide and he bumped 
up out of his chair. He said 
breathlessly, *What have you 
done to it?” 

I looked down at my hands. I 
was holding a little structure of 
eight cubes, joined together in a 
small cross. “Why, nothing,” I 
said, feeling a little foolish. “I 
only folded most of them to- 
gether.” 

“That’s impossible! There were 
only twelve open ones to begin 
with! All of the others were six- 
sided!” 

“FARNSWORTH made a grab 
for it, apparently beside him- 
self, and the gesture was so sud- 
den that I drew back. It made 
Farnsworth miss his grab and the 
little object flew from my hands 
and hit the floor, solidly, on one 
of its comers. There was a slight 
bump as it hit, and a faint click- 
ing noise, and the thing seemed 
to crumple in a very peculiar 
way. And sitting in front of us 
on the floor was one little one- 
inch cube, and nothing else. 

For at least a full minute, we 
stared at it. Then I stood up and 
looked in my chair seat, looked 
around the floor of the room, even 
got down on my knees and 
peered under the chair. Farns- 
worth was watching me, and 
when I finished and sat down 
again, he asked, “No others?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“No other cubes,” I said, “any- 
where.” 

“I was afraid of that.” He 
pointed an unsteady finger at the 
one cube in front of us. “I sup- 
pose they’re all in there.” Some 
of his agitation had begun to 
wear off — you can, I suppose, get 
used to anything — and after a 
moment he said thoughtfully, 
“What was that you said about 
folding the paper to make a 
cube?” 

I looked at him and managed 
an apologetic smile. I had been 
thinking the same thing. “What 
was that you said about having 
to go into another dimension to 
do it?” 

He didn’t smile back, but he 
got up and said, “Well, I doubt if 
it can bite,” and bent over and 
picked the cube up, hefting its 
weight carefully in his hand. “It 
seems to weigh the same as the 
-sixty-four did,” he said, quite 
calmly now. Then he looked at it 
closely and suddenly became agi- 
tated again. “Good heavens! Look 
at this!” He held it up. 

On one side, exactly in the 
center, was a neat little hole, 
about a half-inch across. 

I moved my head closer to the 
cube and saw that the hole was 
not really circular. It was like 
the iris diaphragm of a camera, a 
polygon made of many overlap- 
ping, straight pieces of metal, al- 
lowing an opening for light to 



enter. Nothing was visible 
through the hole; I could see 
only an undefined blackness. 

“I don’t understand how . 

I began, and stopped. 

“Nor I,” he said. “Let’s see if 
there’s anything in here.” 

TTE PUT the cube up to his 
eye and squinted and peered 
for a minute. Then he carefully 
set it on the table, walked to his 
chair, sat down and folded his 
hands over his fat little lap. 

“George,” he said, “there is 
something in there.” His voice 
now was very steady and yet 
strange. 

“What?” I asked. What else do 
you say? 

“A little ball,” he said; “A lit- 
tle round ball. Quite misted over, 
but nonetheless a ball.” 

“Well!” I said. 

“George, I’ll get the gin.” 

He was back from the side- 
board in what seemed an in- 
credibly short time. He had the 
sloe gin in highball glasses, with 
ice and water. It tasted horrible. 

When I finished mine, I said, 
“Delicious. Let’s have another,” 
and we did. After I drank that 
one, I felt a good deal more ra- 
tional. 

I set my glass down. “Farns- 
worth, it just occurred to me. 
Isn’t the fourth dimension sup- 
posed to be time, according to 
Einstein?” 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He had finished his second sloe 
gin highball, unmulled, by then. 
“Supposed to be, yes, according 
to Einstein. I call it ifth — or 
oofth — take your pick.” He held 
up the cube again, much more 
confidently now, I noticed. “And 
what about the fifth dimension?” 

“Beats me,” I said, looking at 
the cube, which was beginning 
to seem vaguely sinister to me. 
“Beats the hell out of me.” 

“Beats me, too, George,” he 
said almost gaily — an astonishing 
mood for old Farnsworth. He 
turned the cube around with his 
small, fat fingers. “This is prob- 
ably all wrapped up in time in 
some strange way. Not to men- 
tion the very peculiar kind of 
space it appears to be involved 
with. Extraordinary, don’t you 
think?” 

“Extraordinary,” I nodded. 

“George, I think I’ll take an- 
other look ” And he put the cube 
back to his eye again. “Well,” he 
said, after a moment of squint- 
ing, “same little ball.” 

“What’s it doing?” I wanted 
to know. 

“Nothing. Or perhaps spinning 
a bit. I’m not sure. It’s quite 
fuzzy, you see, and misty. Dark 
in there, too.” 

“Let me see,” I said, realizing 
that, after all, if Farnsworth could 
see the thing in there, so could I. 

“In a minute. I wonder what 
sort of time I’m looking into — 



past or future, or what?” 

“And what sort of space . .” 
I was saying when, suddenly, lit- 
tle Farnsworth let out a fantastic 
shriek, dropped the cube as if it 
had suddenly turned into a snake, 
and threw his hands over his 
eyes. 

He sank back into his chair 
and cried, “My God! My God!” 

T WAS apprehensive when the 
cube hit the floor, but noth- 
ing happened to it. It did not 
fold up into no cube at all, nor 
proliferate back into sixty-four of 
itself. 

‘What happened?” I asked, 
rushing over to Farnsworth, who 
was squirming about in his arm- 
chair, his face still hidden by his 
hands. 

“My eye!” he moaned, almost 
sobbing. “It stabbed my eye! 
Quick, George, call me an ambu- 
lance!” 

I hurried to the telephone and 
fumbled with the book, looking 
for the right number, until Farns- 
worth said, “Quick, George!” 
again and, in desperation, I dialed 
the operator and told her to send 
us an ambulance. 

When I got back to Farns- 
worth, he had taken his hand 
from the unhurt eye and I could 
see that a trickle of blood was 
beginning to run down the other 
wrist. He had almost stopped 
squirming, but from his face it 



THE IFTH OF OOFTH

was ohvious that the pain was 
still quite intense. 

He stood up. “I need another 
drink,” he said, and began head- 
ing unsteadily for the sideboard, 
when he stepped on the cube, 
which was still lying in front of 
his chair, and was barely able to 
keep himself from falling head- 
long, tripping on it. The cube 
skidded a few feet, stopping, 
hole-side up, near the fire. 

He said to the cube, enraged, 
“Drat you, I’ll show you . !” 
and he reached down and 
swooped up the poker from the 
hearth. It had been lying there 
for mulling drinks, its end resting 
on the coals, and by now it was 
a brilliant cherry red. He took 
the handle with both hands and 
plunged the red-hot tip into the 
hole of the cube, pushing it down 
against the floor. 

“I’ll show you!” he yelled 
again, and I watched understand- 
ingly as he shoved with all his 
weight, pushing and twisting, 
forcing the poker down with 
angry energy. There was a faint 
hissing sound and little wisps of 
dark smoke came from the hole, 
around the edges of the poker. 

Then there was a strange, suck- 
ing noise and the poker began 
to sink into the cube. It must 
have gone in at least eight or ten 
inches — completely impossible, 
of course, since it was a one-inch 
cube — and even Farnsworth be- 

66 



came so alarmed at this that he 
abruptly yanked the poker out of 
the hole. 

As he did, black smoke arose 
in a little column for a moment 
and then there was a popping 
sound and the cube fell apart, 
scattering itself into hundreds of 
little squares of plastic and alu- 
minum. 

Oddly enough, there were no 
burn marks on the aluminum and 
none of the plastic seemed to 
have melted. There was no sign 
of a little, misty ball. 

Farnsworth returned his right 
hand to his now puffy and quite 
bloody eye. He stood staring at 
the profusion of little squares 
with his good eye. His free hand 
was trembling. 

Then there was the sound of a 
siren, becoming louder. He turned 
and looked at me balefully. “That 
must be the ambulance. I sup- 
pose I’d better get my tooth- 
brush.” 

'P’ARNSWORTH lost the eye. 

Within a week, though, he was 
pretty much his old chipper self 
again, looking quite dapper with 
a black leather patch. One in- 
teresting thing — the doctor re- 
marked that there were powder 
burns of some sort on the eyelid, 
and that the eye itself appeared 
to have been destroyed by a 
small explosion. He assumed that 
it had been a case of a gun mis- 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




firing, the cartridge exploding in 
an open breech somehow. Farns- 
worth let him think that; it was 
as good an explanation as any. 

I suggested to Farnsworth that 
he ought to get a green patch, to 
match his other eye. He laughed 
at the idea and said he thought it 
might be a bit showy. He was 
already starting work on another 
pentaract; he was going to find 
out just what . 

But he never finished. Nine 
days after the accident, there was 
a sudden flurry of news reports 
from the other side of the world, 
fantastic stories that made the 
Sunday supplements go com- 
pletely mad with delight, and we 
began to guess what had hap- 
pened. There wouldn’t be any 
need to build the sixty-four-cube 
cross and try to find a way of 
folding it up. We knew now. 

It had been a five-dimensional 
cube, all right. And one exten- 
sion of it had been in time — into 
the future; nine days into the fu- 
ture — and the other extension 
had been into a most peculiar 
kind of space, one that distorted 
sizes quite strangely. 

All of this became obvious 
when, three days later, it hap- 
pened on our side of the world 
and the Sunday supplements 
were scooped by the phenome- 
non itself, which, by its nature, 
required no newspaper reporting. 

Across the entire sky of the 



Western hemisphere there ap- 
peared— so vast that it eclipsed 
the direct light of the Sun from 
Fairbanks, Alaska, to Cape Horn 
— a tremendous human eye, with 
a vast, glistening, green pupiL 
Part of the lid was there, too, and 
all of it was as if framed in a gi- 
gantic circle. Or not exactly a cir- 
cle, but a polygon of many sides, 
like the iris diaphragm of a cam- 
era shutter. 

Toward nightfall, the eye 
blinked once and probably five 
hundred million people screamed 
simultaneously. It remained there 
all of the night, glowing bale- 
fully in the reflected sunlight, 
obliterating the stars. 

A thousand new religious cults 
were formed that night, and a 
thousand old ones proclaimed the 
day as The One Predicted for 
Centuries. 

Probably more than half the 
people on Earth thought it was 
God. Only two knew that it was 
Oliver Farnsworth, peering at a 
misty little spinning ball in a 
five-dimensional box, nine days 
before, totally unaware that the 
little ball was the Earth itself, 
contained in a little one-inch cube 
that was an enclave of swollen 
time and shrunken space. 

‘W/'HEN I had dropped the 
” pentaract and had somehow 
caused it to fold itself into two 
new dimensions, it had reached 



THE IFTH OF OOFTH 



67 




out through fifth-dimensional 
space and folded the world into 
itself, and had begun accelerating 
the time within it, in rough pro- 
portion to size, so that as each 
minute passed in Farnsworth’s 
study, about one day was passing 
on the world within the cube. 

We knew this because about a 
minute had passed while Farns- 
worth had held his eye against 
the cube the second time — the 
first time had, of course, been the 
appearance over Asia — and nine 
days later, when we saw the same 
event from our position on the 
Earth in the cube, it was twenty- 
six hours before the eye was 
“stabbed” and withdrew. 

It happened early in the morn- 
ing, just after the Sun had left 
the horizon and was passing into 
eclipse behind the great circle 
that contained the eye. Someone 
stationed along a defense-perim- 
eter station panicked — someone 
highly placed. Fifty guided mis- 
siles were launched, straight up, 
the most powerful on Earth. Each 
carried a hydrogen warhead. 
Even before the great shock wave 
from their explosion came crash- 
ing down to Earth, the eye had 
disappeared. 

Somewhere, I knew, an unim- 
aginably vast Oliver Farnsworth 
was squirming and yelping, car- 
rying out the identical chain of 
events that I had seen happening 
in the past and that yet must be 

*8 



happening now, along the im- 
mutable space-time continuum 
that Farnsworth’s little cube had 
somehow by-passed. 

The doctor had talked of pow- 
der burns. I wondered what he 
would think if he knew that 
Farnsworth had been hit in the 
eye with fifty infinitesimal hy- 
drogen bombs. 

For a week, there was nothing 
else to talk about in the world. 
Two billion people probably dis- 
cussed, thought about and 
dreamed of nothing else. There 
had been no more dramatic hap- 
pening since the creation of the 
Earth and Sun than the appear- 
ance of Farnsworth’s eye. 

But two people, out of those 
two billion, thought of something 
else. They thought of the un- 
changeable, pre-set space-time 
continuum, moving at the rate of 
one minute for every day that 
passed here on our side of the 
pentaract, while that vast Oliver 
Farnsworth and I, in the other- 
space, other-time, were staring at 
the cube that contained our 
world, lying on their floor. 

On Wednesday, we could say, 
Now he’s gone to the telephone. 
On Thursday, Now he’s looking 
through the book. On Saturday, 
By now he must be dialing the 
operator . 

And on Tuesday morning, when 
the Sun came up, we were to- 
gether and saw it rise, for we 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




spent our nights together by then, 
because we had lost the knack of 
sleeping and did not want to be 
alone; and when the day had be- 
gun, we didn’t say it, because we 
couldn’t. But we thought it. 

We thought of a colossal, cos- 



mic Farnsworth saying, ‘Til show 
you!” and shoving, pushing and 
twisting, forcing with all of his 
might, into the little round hole, 
a brilliantly glowing, hissing, 
smoking, red-hot poker.

The idea of getting warriors back to one's own lines after they 
have been cut off by the enemy has always been a military goal. But 
not until recently was the technology available— so much so that the 
items supplied would bemuse scientists, not to mention soldiers, of 
only a generation ago. That is the basis of Frederik Pohl's novelet 
next month, which shows just why it isn't fair that a smart but luckless 
man like Mooney has to scrounge to make a living . while Harse is 
never bothered with the problem of how to live luxuriously . simply 
because he has a SURVIVAL KIT. There you have the title and the 
premise of Pohl's story, but wait till you learn what's in that survival 
kit and what it can do! 

Fritz Leiber is back and GALAXY has himl After what may prove 
to be the longest layoff in the history of science fiction — which is much 
less important than that it was the most missed — he returns with an 
ingenious and moving novelet entitled TIME IN THE ROUND. Only 
Leiber could make a touching story out of this dilemma: poor Butcher 
suffers more than any dictator ever did — for everybody gives in to 
him because he is so punny and they are so impregnable! (The reason 
for the glad movie-type exclamation at the beginning of this para- 
graph: Leiber promises that this is just the first of many stories for 
GALAXY. Reason enough for Hollywood -type glee, wouldn't you say?) 

There will be another novelet . short stories, of course . our

Victim from Space 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

A time to sow, a time to reap, a time to 
live— all the Igathians agreed with this 
—but not when it came to a time to diel 






had found, were remarkably stu- 
pid and amazingly ugly. Their 
foods were impossible and their 
manners deplorable. Unfortu- 
nately, the public wasn’t inter- 
ested in that sort of detail. So 
Hadwell wrote romances and 
hoped someday to live one. 

The planet below was cityless, 
tropical, beautiful. His ship was 
already homing on a small thatch- 
hut village. 

“Perhaps I’ll find it here,” Had- 
well said to himself as the space- 
ship began braking sharply. 

t" 1 ARLY that morning, Kataga 
and his daughter Mele 
crossed the bridge of vines to 
Ragged Mountain, to gather frag 
blossoms. Nowhere on Igathi did 
the frag bloom so lustily as it did 
on Ragged Mountain. And this 
was as it should be, for the moun- 
tain was sacred to Thangookari, 
the smiling god. 

Later in the day, they were 
joined by Brog, a dull-faced 
youth of no significance whatso- 
ever, except to himself. 

Mele had the feeling that some- 
thing very important was about 
to happen. She was a tall, slender 
girl and she worked as though in 
a trance, moving slowly and 
dreamily, her long black hair 
tossed by the wind. Familiar ob- 
jects seemed imbued with unu- 
sual clarity and significance. She 
gazed at the village, a tiny cluster 



of huts across the river, and with 
wonder looked behind her at the 
Pinnacle, where all Igathian mar- 
riages were performed, and be- 
yond that to the delicately tinted 
sea. 

She was the prettiest girl in 
Igathi; even the old priest ad- 
mitted it. She longed for a dra- 
matic role in life. But village life 
droned on and here she was, pick- 
ing frag blossoms under two hot 
suns. 

It seemed very unfair. 

Her father gathered frag ener- 
getically, humming as he worked. 
He knew that the blossoms would 
soon be fermenting in the village 
vat. Lag, the priest, would mum- 
ble suitable words over the brew 
and a libation would be poured in 
front of Thangookari’s image. 
When these formalities were con- 
cluded, the entire village, dogs 
included, would go on a splendid 
drunk. 

These thoughts made the work 
go faster. Also, Kataga had 
evolved a subtle and dangerous 
scheme to increase his prestige. 
It made for very pleasant specu- 
lation. 

Brog straightened up, mopped 
his face with the end of his loin- 
cloth and glanced overhead for 
signs of rain. 

“Look!” he shouted. 

Kataga and Mele stared up. 

“There!” Brog screamed. “There, 
up there!”

TN THE sky, a silver speck sur- 
rounded by red and green 
flames was descending slowly, 
growing larger as they watched, 
and resolving into a shiny sphere. 

“The prophecy!” Kataga mur- 
mured reverently. “At last— after 
all the centuries of waiting!” 
“Let’s tell the village!” Mele 
cried. 

“Wait,” Brog said. He flushed 
and dug his toe into the ground. 
“I saw it first, you know.” 

“Of course you did,” Mele said 
impatiently. 

“And since I saw it first,” Brog 
continued, “thereby rendering an 
important service to the village, 
don’t you think — wouldn’t it be 
proper — ” 

Brog wanted what every Iga- 
thian desired, worked and prayed 
for, and what intelligent men like 
Kataga cast subtle schemes for. 
But it was unseemly to call the 
desired thing by name. Mele and 
her father understood, however. 

“What do you think?” Kataga 
asked. 

“I suppose he does deserve 
something,” Mele said. 

Brog rubbed his hands together. 
“Would you, Mele? Would you 
do it yourself?” 

“However,” Mele said, “the 
whole thing is up to the priest.” 
“Please!” Brog begged. “Lag 
might not feel I’m ready. Please, 
Kataga! Do it yourself!” 

Kataga studied his daughter’s 

THE VICTIM FROM SPACE 



inflexible expression and sighed. 
“Sorry, Brog. If it were just be- 
tween us . But Mele is scrupu- 
lously orthodox. Let the priest de- 
cide.” 

Brog nodded, completely de- 
feated. Overhead, the shiny sphere 
dropped lower, toward the level 
plain near the village. The three 
Igathi gathered their sacks of 
frag blossoms and began the trek 
home. 

They reached the bridge of 
vines, which spanned a raging 
mountain river. Kataga sent Brog 
first and Mele next. Then he fol- 
lowed, drawing a small knife he 
had concealed in his loincloth. 

As he had expected, Mele and 
Brog didn’t look back. They were 
too busy keeping their balance on 
the flimsy, swaying structure. 
When Kataga reached the center 
of the bridge, he ran his fingers 
beneath the main supporting vine. 
In a moment, he found the worn 
spot he had located days earlier. 
Quickly he drew his knife across 
the spot and felt the fibers part. 
Another slash or two and the vine 
would snap under a man’s weight. 

But this was enough for now. 
Well satisfied with himself, Ka- 
taga replaced the knife in his 
loincloth and hurried after Brog 
and Mele. 

r I 1 HE village came alive at the 
news of the visitor. Men and 
women rushed back and forth dis- 

73 




cussing the great event and an 
impromptu dance began in front 
of the Shrine of the Instrument. 
But it stopped when the old 
priest hobbled out of the Temple 
of Thangookari. 

Lag, the priest, was a tall, ema- 
ciated old man. After years of 
service, his face had grown to re- 
semble the smiling, benevolent 
god he worshiped. On his bald 
head was the feathered crown of 
the priestly caste, and he leaned 
heavily on a sacred black mace. 

The people gathered in front of 
him. Brog stood near the priest, 
rubbing his hands together hope- 
fully, but frightened to press for 
his reward. 

“My people,” Lag said, “the an- 
cient prophecy of the Igathi is 
now to be fulfilled. A great gleam- 
ing sphere has dropped from the 
heavens, as the old legends pre- 
dicted. Within the sphere will be 
a being such as ourselves and he 
will be an emissary of Thangoo- 
kari.” 

The people nodded, faces rapt. 

“The emissary will be a doer of 
great things! He will perform acts 
of good such as no man has ever 
before seen. And when he has 
completed his work and claimed 
his rest, he will expect his re- 
ward.” 

Lag’s voice fell to an impres- 
sive whisper. “This reward is 
what every Igathi an desires, 
dreams of, prays for. It is the final 



behest which Thangookari grants 
to those who serve him and the 
village well.” 

The priest turned to Brog. 
“You, Brog, have been the first to 
witness the coming of the emis- 
sary. You have served the village 
well.” The priest raised his arms. 
“Friends! Do you feel that Brog 
should receive the reward he 
craves?” 

Most of the people felt he 
should. But Vassi, a wealthy mer- 
chant, stepped forward, frowning. 

“It isn’t equitable,” he said. 
“The rest of us work toward this 
for years and give expensive gifts 
to the temple. Brog hasn’t done 
enough to merit even the most 
basic reward. Besides, he’s hum- 
bly bom.” 

OU have a point,” the priest 
admitted, and Brog groaned 
audibly. “But,” Lag continued, 
“the bounty of Thangookari is 
not only for the high-bom. The 
humblest citizen may aspire to it 
If Brog were not suitably re- 
warded, would not others lose 
hope?” 

The people roared their assent 
and Brog’s eyes grew wet with 
thankfulness. 

“Kneel, Brog,” said the priest 
and his face seemed to radiate 
kindliness and love. 

Brog knelt The villagers held 
their breath. 

Lag lifted his heavy mace and 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




brought it down with all his 
strength on Brog’s skull. It was a 
good blow, squarely struck. Brog 
collapsed, squirmed once, and ex- 
pired. His expression of joy was 
beautiful to behold. 

“How lovely it was,” Kataga 
murmured enviously. 

Mele grasped his arm. ‘Don’t 
worry, Father. Someday, you will 
have your reward.” 

“I hope so,” Kataga said. “But 
how can I be sure? Look at Rii. 
A nicer, more pious fellow never 
lived. That poor old man worked 
and prayed all his life for a vio- 
lent death. Any kind of violent 
death. And what happened? He 
passed away in his sleep. What 
kind of death is that for a man?” 
“There are always one or two 
exceptions.” 

“I could name a dozen others,” 
Kataga said. “Two dozen!” 

“Try not to worry about it, 
Father,” Mele soothed. “I know 
you’ll die beautifully, like Brog.” 
“Yes, yes. But if you think 
about it, Brog’s was such a simple 
ending.” His eyes lighted up. “I 
would like something really big, 
something painful and compli- 
cated and wonderful, like the 
emissary will have.” 

Mele looked away. “That is 
presuming above your station, 
Father” 

“True, true. Oh, well, some- 
day. .” He smiled to himself. 
Someday indeed! An intelligent 

THI VICTIM FROM SPACE 



and courageous man took matters 
into his own hands and arranged 
for his own violent death, instead 
of waiting for the old priest to 
make up his feeble mind. Call it 
heresy or anything else, Kataga 
told himself, a man had the right 
to die as painfully and violently 
as he pleased — if he could get 
away with it. 

The thought of the half-severed 
vine filled him with satisfaction. 
How fortunate he had never 
learned how to swim! 

“Come,” Mele said. “Let’s wel- 
come the emissary.” 

They followed the villagers to 
the level plain where the spherq 
had landed. 

n ICHARD HADWELL leaned 
-*-*• back in his padded pilot’s 
chair and wiped perspiration from 
his forehead. The last natives had 
just left his ship and he could 
hear them singing and laughing 
as they returned to their village 
in the evening twilight. His ship 
smelled of flowers and honey and 
wine, and drum-beats seemed to 
echo still from the gray metal 
walls. 

He smiled reminiscently and 
took down his notebook. Select- 
ing a stylus, he wrote: 

“Beautiful to behold is Igathi, 
a place of stately mountains and 
raging mountain streams, beaches 
of black sand, riotous vegetation 
in the jungles, great flowering 

75 




trees in the forested glades.” 

Not bad, Hadwell told himself. 
He pursed his lips and continued. 

“The people here are a hand- 
some humanoid race, a light tan 
in coloration, comely to behold. 
They greeted me with flowers 
and dancing and many signs of 
joy and affection. I had no trou- 
ble hypnopeding their language 
and soon felt as though this had 
always been my home. They are 
a light-hearted, laughter-loving 
people, gentle and courteous, liv- 
ing serenely in a state of near- 
nature. What a lesson is here for 
Civilized Man! 

“One’s heart goes out to them, 
and to Thangookari, their benev- 
olent diety. One hopes that Civi- 
lized Man, with his genius for 
destruction and frenetic behavior, 
does not come here, to turn these 
folk from their path of modera- 
tion.” 

Hadwell selected a stylus with 
a finer point and wrote, “There 
is a girl named Mele who—” He 
crossed out the line and wrote, “A 
black-haired girl named Mele, 
lovely beyond compare, came 
close to me and gazed deep into 
my eyes—” He crossed that out, 
too. 

Frowning deeply, he tried sev- 
eral possible lines: 

“Her limpid brown eyes gave 
promise of joys beyond — ” 

“Her small red mouth quivered 
ever so slightly when I — ” 

76 



“Though her small hand rested 
on my arm for but a moment—” 

He crumpled the page. Five 
months of enforced celibacy in 
space was having its effect, he de- 
cided. He had better return to the 
main issue and leave Mele for 
later. 

He wrote, “There are many 
ways in which a sympathetic ob- 
server such as myself could help 
these people. Medically, for ex- 
ample. But the temptation is 
strong to do absolutely nothing, 
for fear of disrupting their cul- 
ture and breeding dissatisfaction.” 

Closing his notebook, Hadwell 
looked out a port at the distant 
village, now lighted by torches. 
Then he opened the notebook 
again. 

“But their culture appears to 
be strong and flexible. Certain 
kinds of aid can do nothing but 
profit them. And these I will 
freely give.” 

He closed the notebook with a 
snap and put away his stylus. 

T HE following day, Hadwell 
began his good works. He 
found many Igathi suffering from 
a variety of diseases transmitted 
by migratory vegetation. By ju- 
dicious selection of antibiotics, he 
was able to arrest all except the 
most advanced cases. Then he di- 
rected work teams to drain the 
fields where the hobo plants bred. 
As he went on his healing 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




rounds, Mele accompanied him. 
The beautiful Igathian girl 
quickly learned the rudiments of 
nursing and Hadwell found her 
assistance invaluable. 

Soon, all significant disease was 
cleared up in the village. Hadwell 
then began to spend his days in a 
sunny grove not far from Igathi, 
where he rested and worked on 
his book. 

A town meeting was called at 
once by Lag, to discuss the im- 
port of this. 

“Friends,” said the old priest, 
“our friend Hadwell has done 
wonderful things for the village. 
He has cured our sick, so that 
they, too, may live to partake of 
Thangookari’s gift. Now Hadwell 
is tired and rests in the suns. Now 
Hadwell expects the reward he 
came here for.” 

“It is fitting,” the merchant 
Vassi said, “that the emissary re- 
ceive his reward. I suggest that 
the priest take his mace and go 
forth — ” 

“Why so stingy?” asked Juele, 
a priest-in-training. “Is Thangoo- 
kari’s messenger deserving of no 
finer death? Hadwell merits bet- 
ter than the mace! Much better!” 

“You are right,” Vassi admit- 
ted slowly. “In that case, I rec- 
ommend that we drive poison- 
ous legenberry quills under his 
fingernails.” 

“Maybe that’s good enough for 
a merchant,” said Tgara, the 

TMI VICTIM FROM SPACE 



stone-cutter, “but not for Had- 
well. He deserves a chiefs death! 
I move that we tie him down and 
kindle a small fire at his toes, 
gradually 

“Wait,” said Lag. “The emis- 
sary has earned the Death of an 
Adept. Therefore let him be 
taken, tenderly and firmly, to the 
nearest giant anthill and there be 
buried to his neck.” 

There were shouts of approval. 
Tgara said, “And as long as he 
screams, the ceremonial drums 
will pound.” 

“And there will be dances for 
him,” said Vassi. 

“And a glorious drunk,” Kataga 
added. 

Everyone agreed that it would 
be an enviable death. 

So the final details were de- 
cided and a time set. The village 
throbbed with excitement and re- 
ligious ecstasy. All the huts were 
decorated with flowers, except 
the Shrine of the Instrument, 
which naturally had to remain 
bare. The women laughed and 
sang as they prepared the death 
feast. Only Mele, for some unac- 
countable reason, was forlorn. 
With lowered head, she walked 
through the village and climbed 
slowly to the hills beyond, to 
Hadwell. 

XT ADWELL was stripped to 
the waist and basking under 
the two suns. “Hi, Mele,” he said. 

77 




“I heard the drums. Is something 
up?” 

“There will be a celebration,” 
Mele replied, sitting down beside 
him. 

“That’s nice. All right if I at- 
tend?” 

Mele stared at him, nodding 
slowly. Her heart melted at the 
sight of such courage. The emis- 
sary was showing a true observ- 
ance of the ancient punctilio, by 
which a man pretended that his 
own death feast was something 
that really didn’t concern him at 
all. Men in this day and age 
were not able to maintain the 
necessary aplomb. But, of course, 
an emissary of Thangookari 
would follow the rules better than 
anyone. 

“How soon does it start?” he 
asked. 

“In an hour,” Mele said. For- 
merly she had been straightfor- 
ward and free with him. Now her 
heart was heavy, oppressed. She 
didn’t know why. Shyly she 
glanced at his bright alien gar- 
ments, his red hair. 

“Oughta be nice,” Hadwell 
mused. “Yessir, it oughta be 
mighty nice. ” His voice trailed 
away. 

From under his lowered eye- 
lids, he looked at the comely 
Igathian girl, observed the pure 
line of neck and shoulder, her 
straight dark hair, and sensed 
rather than smelled her faint 



sachet Nervously he plucked a 
blade of grass. 

“Mele,” he said, “I-” 

The words died on his lips. 
Suddenly, startlingly, she was in 
his arms. 

“Oh, Mele!” 

“Hadwell!” she cried, and 
strained close to him. Abruptly, 
she pulled free, looking at him 
with worried eyes. 

“What’s the matter, honey?” 

“Hadwell, is there anything 
more you could do for the vil- 
lage? Anything? My people 
would appreciate it so.” 

“Sure there is,” Hadwell said. 
"But I thought Fd rest up first, 
take it easy.” 

“No! Please!” she begged. 
“Those irrigation ditches you 
spoke of. Could you start them 
now?” 

“If you want me to, honey,” 
Hadwell said. “But—” 

“Oh, darling!” She sprang to 
her feet. 

Hadwell reached for her, but 
she stepped back. 

“There is no time! I must hurry 
and tell the village!” 

She ran from him. And Had- 
well was left to ponder the strange 
ways of aliens, and particularly 
of alien women. 

lVf’ELE ran back to the village 
and found the priest in the 
temple, praying for wisdom and 
guidance. Quickly she told him 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




about the emissary’s new plans 
for aiding the village. 

The old priest nodded slowly. 
“Then the ceremony shall be de- 
ferred. But tell me, daughter, why 
are you involved in this?” 

Mele blushed and could not 
answer. 

The old priest smiled. But then 
his face became stern. “I under- 
stand. But listen to me, girl. Do 
not allow love to sway you from 
the proper worship of Thangoo- 
kari and from the observances of 
the ancient and honorable ways 
of our village.” 

“Of course not!” Mele said. “I 
simply felt that an Adept’s death 
was not good enough for Had- 
well. He deserves more! He de- 
serves —the Ultimate!” 

O MAN has been worthy of 
the Ultimate for six hun- 
dred years. Not since the demi- 
god V’ktat saved the Igathian 
race from the dread Huelva 
Beasts.” 

“But Hadwell has the stuff of 
heroes in him. Give him time, let 
him strive! He will prove wor- 
thy!” 

“Perhaps so” the priest said 
doubtfully. “It would be a great 
thing for the village. But con- 
sider, Mele. It might take a life- 
time for Hadwell to prove him- 
self.” 

“Wouldn’t it be worth waiting 
for?” 



The old priest -fingered his 
mace and his forehead wrinkled 
in thought. “You may be right 
Yes, you may be right.” 

Suddenly he straightened and 
glanced sharply at her. “But tell 
me the truth, Mele. Are you 
really trying to preserve him for 
the Ultimate Death? Or do you 
merely want to keep him for 
yourself?” 

“He must have the death he 
deserves,” Mele answered se- 
renely. 

But she was unable to meet 
the priest’s eye. 

“I wonder,” the old man said. 
“I wonder what lies in your heart. 
I think you tread dangerously 
close to heresy, Mele — you who 
were among the most orthodox.” 

Mele was about to answer, 
when the merchant Vassi rushed 
into the temple. 

“Come quickly!” he cried. “It is 
the farmer Iglai! He has evaded 
the taboo!" 

They hurried after him to the 
death scene. 

The fat, jolly farmer had died 
a terrible death. He had been 
walking his usual route from his 
hut to the village center, past an 
old thorn tree. Without warning, 
the tree had toppled on him. 
Thoms had impaled him through 
and through. Eyewitnesses said 
the farmer had writhed and 
moaned for over an hour before 
expiring. 




THE VICTIM FROM SPACE 



79 




But he had died with a smile 
on his face. 

T HE priest looked at the crowd 
surrounding Iglai’s body. Sev- 
eral of the villagers were hiding 
grins behind their hands. Lag 
walked over to the thorn tree 
and examined it. There were faint 
marks of a saw blade, which had 
been roughened over and con- 
cealed with clay. 

The priest turned to the crowd. 
“Was Iglai near this tree very 
often?” 

“He sure was,” another farmer 
said. “Always ate his lunch under 
this tree.” 

The crowd was laughing openly 
now, proud of Iglai’s achievement. 
Remarks began to fly back and 
forth. 

“I wondered why he always ate 
here.” 

“Never wanted company. Said 
he liked to eat alone.” 

“Hah!” 

“He must have been sawing all 
the time.” 

“For months, probably. That’s 
tough wood.” 

“Very clever of Iglai.” 

“I’ll say! He was only a farmer 
and no one would call him re- 
ligious — but he got himself "a 
damned fine death.” 

“Listen, good people!” cried 
Lag. “Iglai did a sacrilegious 
thing! Only a priest can grant 
violent death!” 



“What the priests don’t see 
can’t hurt them,” someone re- 
torted. 

“So it was sacrilege,” another 
man said. “Iglai got himself a fine 
death. That’s the important 
thing.” 

The old priest turned sadly 
away. 

There was not a thing he 
could do. If he had caught Iglai 
in time, he would have applied 
strict sanctions. Iglai would never 
have dared arrange another death 




so 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and would probably have died 
quietly and sheepishly in bed, at 
a ripe old age. 

But now it was too late. The 
farmer had his death and had al- 
ready gone to Rookechangi on 
the wings of it. Asking the god to 
punish Iglai in the afterlife was 
useless, for the farmer was right 
there on the spot to plead his 
own case. 

Lag asked, ‘‘Didn’t any of you 
see him sawing that tree?” 

If anyone had, he wouldn’t ad- 



mit it They stuck together, Lag 
knew. In spite of the religious 
training he had instilled in them 
from earliest childhood, they per- 
sisted in trying to outwit the 
priests. 

When would they realize that 
an unauthorized death could 
never be as satisfying as a death 
one worked for, deserved and 
had performed with all ceremo- 
nial observations? 

He sighed. Life was a burden 
sometimes. 




THE VICTIM FROM SPACE 



81 



A WEEK later, Hadwell wrote 
in his diary: “There has 
never been a race like these 
Igathians. I have lived among 
them now, eaten and drunk with 
them, and observed their ceremo- 
nies. I know and understand 
them. And the truth about them 
is startling, to say the least. 

“The fact is, the Igathians do 
not know the meaning of war! 
Consider that, Civilized Man! 
Never in all their recorded and 
oral history have they had one. 
They simply cannot conceive of 
it. I give the following illustration. 

“I tried to explain war to Ka- 
taga, father of the incomparable 
Mele. The man scratched his 
head and inquired, ‘You say that 
many kill many? That is war?’ 

“ ‘That’s a part of it,’ I said. 
‘Thousands killing thousands.’ 

“ ‘In that case,’ Kataga said, 
‘many are dead at the same time, 
in the same way?’ 

“‘Correct,’ said I. 

“He pondered this for a long 
time, then turned to me and said, 
‘It is not good for many to die at 
the same time in the same way. 
Not satisfactory. Every man 
should die his own individual 
death.’ 

“Consider, Civilized Man, the 
incredible naivete of that reply. 
And yet think of the considerable 
truth which resides beneath the 
naivete, a truth which all might 
do well to learn. 



“Moreover, these people do not 
engage in quarrels among them- 
selves, have no blood feuds, no 
crimes of passion, no murder. 

“The conclusion I come to is 
this: Violent death is unknown 
among these people — except, of 
course, for accidents. 

“It is a shame that accidents 
occur so often here and are al- 
most invariably fatal. But this I 
ascribe to the wildness of the sur- 
roundings and to the light- 
hearted, devil-may-care nature of 
the people. And as a matter of 
fact, even accidents do not go un- 
noticed and unchecked. The 
priest, with whom I have formed 
a considerable friendship, de- 
plores the high accident rate and 
is constantly militating against it. 
Always he urges his people to ob- 
serve more caution. 

“He is a good man. 

“And now I write the final, 
most wonderful news of all.” 

Hadwell smiled self-con- 
sciously, hesitated for a moment, 
then returned to his notebook. 

“Mele has consented to become 
my wife! As soon as I complete 
this section of my book, the cere- 
mony begins. Already the festivi- 
ties have started, the feast pre- 
pared. I consider myself the most 
fortunate of men, for Mele is a 
beautiful woman. And a most un- 
usual woman, as well. 

“She has great social conscious- 
ness. A little too much, perhaps. 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




She has been urging me con- 
stantly to do things for the vil- 
lage. And I have done much. I 
have completed an irrigation sys- 
tem for them,, introduced several 
fast-growing food crops, started 
the profession of metal-working, 
and other things too numerous to 
mention. And she wants me to do 
more, much more. 

“But here I have put my foot 
down. I have a right to rest. I 
want a long, languorous honey- 
moon and then a year or so of 
basking in the suns and finishing 
my book. 

“Mele finds this difficult to un- 
derstand. She keeps on trying to 
tell me that I must continue help- 
ing her people. And she speaks of 
some ceremony involving the ‘Ul- 
timate’ (if my translation is cor- 
rect). 

“But I have done enough work. 
I refused to do more, for a year 
or two, at least. 

“This ‘Ultimate’ ceremony is to 
take place directly after our wed- 
ding. I suppose it will be some 
high honor or other that these 
simple people wish to bestow on 
me. I have signified my willing- 
ness to accept it. 

“It should be highly interest- 
ing.” 

"C'OR the wedding, the entire 
village, led by the old priest, 
marched to the Pinnacle, where 
all Igathian marriages were per- 

THE VICTIM FROM SPACE 



formed. The men wore ceremo- 
nial feathers and the women were 
decked in shell jewelry and iri- 
descent stones. Four husky villag- 
ers in the center of the procession 
bore a strange-looking apparatus. 
Hadwell caught only a glimpse of 
it, but he knew it had been taken, 
with tedious ceremony, from a 
plain black-thatched hut which 
seemed to be a shrine of some 
sort. 

In single file, they proceeded 
over the shaky bridge of vines. 
Kataga, bringing up the rear, 
grinned to himself as he secre- 
tively slashed again at the worn 
spot. 

The Pinnacle was a narrow 
spur of black rock thrust out over 
the sea. Hadwell and Mele stood 
on the end of it, faced by the 
priest. The people fell silent as 
Lag raised his arms. 

“O great Thangookari!” the 
priest cried. “Cherish this man 
Hadwell, your emissary, who has 
come to us from out of the sky in 
a shining vehicle, and who has 
done service for the Igathi such 
as no man has ever done. And 
cherish your daughter Mele. 
Teach her to love the memory of 
her husband — and to remain 
strong in her tribal beliefs •” 

The priest stared hard at Mele 
as he said that. And Mele, her 
head held high, gave him look 
for look. 

“I now pronounce you,” said 

S3 




the priest, “man and wife!” 

Hadwell clasped his wife in his 
arms and kissed her. The people 
cheered. Kataga grinned his sly 
grin. 

“And now,” said the priest in 
his gentlest voice, “I have good 
news for you, Hadwell. Great 
news!” 

“Oh?” Hadwell said, reluc- 
tantly releasing his bride. 

“We have judged you,” said 
Lag, “and we have found you 
worthy — of the Ultimate!” 

“Why, thanks,” Hadwell said. 

The priest motioned. Four men 
came up lugging the strange ap- 
paratus which Hadwell had 
glimpsed earlier. Now he saw that 
it was a platform the size of a 
large bed, made of some ancient- 
looking black wood. Lashed to 
the frame were various barbs, 
hooks, sharpened shells and nee- 
dle-shaped thorns. There were 
cups, which contained no liquid 
as yet. And there were other 
things, strange in shape, whose 
purpose Hadwell could not guess. 

“Not for six hundred years,” 
said Lag, “has the Instrument 
been removed from the Shrine of 
the Instrument. Not since the 
days of V’ktat, the hero-god who 
single-handed saved the Igathian 
people from destruction. But it 
has been removed for you, Had- 
well!” 

“Really, I’m not worthy,” Had- 
well protested, succeeding in 

84 



working up a blush. 

A murmur rose from the crowd 
at such modesty. 

“Believe me,” Lag said ear- 
nestly, “you are worthy. Do you 
accept the Ultimate, Hadwell?” 

Hadwell looked at Mele. He 
could not read the expression on 
her lovely face. He looked at the 
priest. Lag’s face was impassive. 
The crowd was deathly still. Had- 
well looked at the Instrument. 
He didn’t like its appearance. A 
doubt began to creep across his 
mind. 

Had he misjudged these peo- 
ple? That Instrument must have 
been used for torture at some an- 
cient time. Those barbs and 
hooks. But what were the 
other things for? Thinking hard, 
Hadwell conceived some of their 
possible usages. He shuddered. 

The crowd was closely packed 
in front of him. Behind him was 
the narrow point of rock and a 
sheer thousand-foot drop below 
it. Hadwell looked again at Mele. 

The love and devotion in her 
face were unmistakable. 

Glancing at the villagers, he 
saw their concern for him. What 
was he worried about? They 
would never do anything to harm 
him, not after all he had done for 
the village. 

The Instrument undoubtedly 
had some symbolic use. 

“I accept the Ultimate,” Had- 
well said to the priest 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




T HE villagers shouted, a deep- 
throated roar that echoed 
from the mountains. They formed 
closely around him, smiling, shak- 
ing his hands. 

“The ceremony will take place 
at once,” said the priest, “in the 
village, in front of the statue of 
Thangookari.” 

Immediately they started back, 
the priest leading. Hadwell and 
his bride were in the center now. 
Mele still had not spoken since 
the ceremony. 

Silently they crossed the sway- 
ing bridge of vines. Once across, 
the villagers pressed more closely 
around Hadwell than before, giv- 
ing him a slightly claustrophobic 
feeling. If he had not been con- 
vinced of their essential goodness, 
he told himself, he might have 
felt genuinely apprehensive. 

Ahead lay the village and the 
altar of Thangookari. The priest 
hurried toward it. 

Suddenly there was a shriek. 
Everyone turned and rushed back 
to the bridge. 

At the brink of the river, Had- 
well saw what had happened. Ka- 
taga, Mele’s father, had brought 
up the rear of the procession. As 
he had reached the midpoint, the 
central supporting vine had inex- 
plicably snapped. Kataga had 
managed to clutch a secondary 
vine, but only for a moment. 
While the villagers watched, his 
hold weakened, released, and he 

86 



dropped into the river. 

Hadwell stared, frozen into 
shock. With dreamlike clarity, he 
saw it all — Kataga falling, a 
smile of magnificent courage on 
his face, the raging white water, 
the jagged rocks below. 

It was a certain, terrible death. 

“Can he swim?” Hadwell asked 
Mele. 

“No,” the girl said. “He refused 
to learn. Oh, Father! How could 
you!” 

The raging white water fright- 
ened Hadwell more than any- 
thing he had ever seen, more than 
the emptiness of space. But the 
father of his wife was in danger. 

He plunged headlong into the 
icy water. 

Kataga was almost unconscious 
when Hadwell reached him, which 
was fortunate, for the Igathian 
did not struggle when Hadwell 
seized him by the hair and 
started to swim vigorously for 
the nearest shore. But he couldn’t 
make it. Currents swept the men 
along, pulling them under and 
throwing them to the surface 
again. By a strenuous effort, Had- 
well was able to avoid the first 
rocks. But more loomed ahead. 

The villagers ran along the 
bank, yelling at him. 

With his strength ebbing rap- 
idly, Hadwell fought again for 
the shore. A submerged rock 
scraped his side and his grip on 
Kataga’s hair began to weaken. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The Igathian was starting to re- 
cover and struggle. 

“Don’t give up, old man,” Had- 
well gasped. The bank sped past. 
Hadwell came within ten feet of 
it, but then the current began to 
carry him out again. 

With his last surge of strength, 
he managed to grab an overhead 
branch and hold on while the cur- 
rent wrenched and tore at his 
body. Moments later, guided by 
the priest, the villagers pulled 
Hadwell and Kataga in to the 
safety of the shore. 

T> OTH men were carried to the 
village. When Hadwell was 
able to breathe normally again, 
he turned and grinned feebly at 
Kataga. 

“Close call, old man,” he said. 

“Meddler!” Kataga spat at 
Hadwell and stalked off. 

Hadwell gaped after him. “Must 
have affected his brain,” he said. 
“Well, shall we get on with the 
Ultimate?” 

The villagers drew close to 
him, their faces menacing. 

“Hah! The Ultimate he wants!” 

“A man like that!” 

“After dragging poor Kataga 
out of the river, he has the nerve 
to. 

“His own father-in-law and he 
saves his life!” 

“A man like that doesn’t de- 
serve the Ultimate!” 

“A man like that,” Vassi the 



merchant summed up, “doesn’t 
deserve to die!” 

Hadwell wondered if they had 
all gone temporarily insane. He 
stood up a bit shakily and ap- 
pealed to the priest. “What is all 
this?” 

Lag, with mournful eyes and 
pale, set lips, looked at him and 
did not answer. 

“Can’t I have the Ultimate 
ceremony?” Hadwell asked, with 
a plaintive note in his voice. 

“You do deserve it,” the priest 
said. “If any man has ever de- 
served the Ultimate, you do, Had- 
well. I feel you should have it, as 
a matter of abstract justice. But 
there is more involved here than 
abstract justice. There are prin- 
ciples of mercy and human pity 
which are dear to Thangookari. 
By these principles, Hadwell, you 
did a terrible and inhuman thing 
when you rescued poor Kataga 
from the river.. I am afraid the 
action is unforgivable.” 

Hadwell didn’t know what to 
say. Apparently there was some 
taboo against rescuing men who 
had fallen into the river. But 
how could they expect him to 
know about it? How could they 
let this one little thing outweigh 
all he had done for them? 

“Isn’t there some ceremony you 
can give me?” he pleaded. “I like 
you people. I want to live here. 
Surely there’s something you can 
do.” 



THE VICTIM FROM SPACE 



87 




The old priest’s eyes misted 
with compassion. He gripped his 
mace, started to lift it 

He was stopped by an ominous 
roar from the crowd. 

“There is nothing I can do,” he 
said. “Leave us, false emissary. 
Leave us, Hadwell— who does not 
deserve to die.” 

“All right!” Hadwell shouted, 
his temper suddenly snapping. 
“To hell with you bunch of dirty 
savages. I wouldn’t stay here if 
you got down on your knees and 
begged me. I’m going. Are you 
with me, Mele?” 

The girl blinked convulsively, 
looked at Hadwell, then at the 
priest. There was a long moment 
of silence. Then the priest mur- 
mured, “Remember your father, 
Mele. Remember the beliefs of 
your people.” 

Mele’s proud little chin came 
up. “I know where my duty lies. 
Let’s go, Richard dear.” 

“Right,” said Hadwell. He 
stalked off to his spaceship, fol- 
lowed by Mele. 

In despair, the old priest 
watched. He cried, “Mele!” once, 
in a heart-broken voice. But Mele 
did not turn back. He saw her 
enter the ship and the port slide 
shut. 

Within minutes, red and blue 
flames bathed the silver sphere. 
The sphere lifted, gained speed, 
dwindled to a speck, and van- 
ished. 

88 



Tears rolled down the old 
priest’s cheeks as he watched it 
go. 

II OURS later, Hadwell said, 
“Darling, I’m taking you to 
Earth, the planet I come from. 
You’ll like it there.” 

“I know I will,” Mele mur- 
mured, staring out a porthole at 
the brilliant stars. 

Somewhere among them was 
her world, lost to her forever. She 
was homesick already. But there 
had been no other choice. A 
woman who loves truly and well 
never loses faith in her man. 

She fingered a tiny sheathed 
dagger concealed in her clothing. 
The dagger was tipped with a pe- 
culiarly painful and slow-acting 
poison. It was a family heirloom, 
to be used when there was no 
priest around, and only on those 
one loved most dearly. 

“I’m through wasting my time,” 
Hadwell said. “With your help, 
I’m going to do great things. 
You’ll be proud of me, honey.” 
Mele knew he meant it. Some- 
day, she thought, Hadwell would 
atone for the sin against her 
father. He would do something, 
some fine deed, perhaps today, 
perhaps tomorrow, perhaps next 
year. And then she would give 
him the most precious thing a 
woman can give to a man. 

A painful death.

THE COFFIN CURE 

By ALAN E. NOURSE 

Help one's fellow-man for fun 
and profit? Oh, yes— but look 
out for the final accounting! 



W HEN the discovery was 
announced, it was Dr. 
Chauncey Patrick Coffin 
who announced it. He had, of 
course, arranged with uncanny 
skill to take most of the credit for 
himself. If it turned out to be 
even greater than he had hoped, 
so much the better. His presenta- 
tion was scheduled for the final 
night of the American College of 
Clinical Practitioners’ annual

meeting, and Coffin had fully in- 
tended it to be a bombshell. 

It was. Its explosion exceeded 
even Dr. Coffin’s wilder expecta- 
tions, which took quite a bit of 
doing. In the end, he had waded 
through more newspaper report- 
ers than medical doctors as he left 
the hall that night. It was a heady 
evening for Chauncey Patrick 
Coffin, M.D. 

Certain others were not so de-

lighted with Coffin’s bombshell. 

“It's idiocy!” young Dr. Phillip 
Dawson all but howled in the 
laboratory conference room the 
next morning. ‘"Blind, screaming 
idiocy! You’ve gone out of your 
mind — that’s all there is to it. 
Can’t you see what you’ve done? 
Aside from selling your colleagues 
down the river, that is?” 

TT E CLENCHED the reprint of 
*-■*- Coffin’s address in his hand 
and brandished it like a broad- 
sword. “ ‘Report on a Vaccine for 
the Treatment and Cure of the 
Common Cold,’ by C. P. Coffin, 
et at. That’s what it says — et at. 
My idea in the first place, Jake 
and I pounding our heads on the 
wall for eight solid months — and 
now you go sneak it into publica- 
tion a full year before we have 
any business publishing a word 
about it — ” 

“Really, Phillip!” Dr. Chauncey 
Coffin ran a pudgy hand through 
his snowy hair. “How ungrateful! 
I thought for sure you’d be de- 
lighted. An excellent presentation, 
I must say — terse, succinct, un- 
equivocal — ” he raised his hand 
— “but generously unequivocal, 
you understand. You should have 
heard the ovation — they nearly 
went wild! And the look on Un- 
derwood’s face! Worth waiting 
twenty years for. ” 

“And the reporters,” snapped 
Phillip. “Don’t forget the report- 

90 



ers.” He whirled on the small 
dark man sitting quietly in the 
comer. “How about that, Jake? 
Did you see the morning papers? 
This thief not only steals our 
work, he splashes it all over the 
countryside in red ink.” 

Dr. Jacob Miles coughed apolo- 
getically. “What Phillip is so 
stormed up about is the prema- 
turity of it all,” he said to Coffin. 
“After all, we’ve hardly had an 
acceptable period of clinical trial.” 

“Nonsense,” said Coffin, glaring 
at Phillip. “Underwood and his 
men were ready to publish their 
discovery within another six 
weeks. Where would we be then? 
How much clinical testing do you 
want? Phillip, you had the worst 
cold of your life when you took 
the vaccine. Have you had any 
since?” 

“No, of course not,” said Phillip 
peevishly. 

“Jacob, how about you? Any 
sniffles?” 

“Oh, no. No colds.” 

“Well, what about those six 
hundred students from the Uni- 
versity? Did I misread the reports 
on them?” 

“No — 98 % cured of active 
symptoms within twenty - four 
hours. Not a single recurrence. 
The results were just short of 
miraculous.” Jake hesitated. “Of 
course, it’s only been a month. 

“Month, year, century! Look at 
them! Six hundred of the world’s

most luxuriant colds and now not 
even a sniffle.” The chubby doctor 
sank down behind the desk, his 
ruddy face beaming. “Come now, 
gentlemen, be reasonable. Think 
positively! There’s work to be 
done, a great deal of work. They’ll 
be wanting me in Washington. 
Press conference in twenty min- 
utes. Drug houses to consult with. 
How dare we stand in the path of 
Progress? We’ve won the greatest 
medical triumph of all times — 
the conquering of the Common 
Cold. We’ll go down in history!” 

And he was perfectly right on 
one point, at least. 

They did go down in history. 

f 1 1 HE public response to the vac- 
cine was little less than mass- 
scale. Of all the ailments that 
have tormented mankind through- 
out history, none was ever more 
universal, more tenacious, more 
uniformly miserable than the 
common cold. 

It respected no barriers, bound- 
aries, or classes; ambassadors and 
chambermaids snuffled and 
sneezed in drippy-nosed unanim- 
ity. The powers in the Kremlin 
sniffed and blew and wept genu- 
ine tears on drafty days, while 
Senatorial debates on Earth-shak- 
ing issues paused reverently upon 
the blowing of a nose, the clearing 
of a rhinorrheic throat. True, 
other illnesses brought disability, 
even death in their wake, but the 

92 



common cold brought torment to 
the millions, as it implacably re- 
sisted the most superhuman of 
efforts to curb it. 

Until that rainy November day 
when the tidings broke to the 
world in four-inch banner heads: 

COFFIN NAILS LID ON COMMON COLD! 



"No More Coughin’ ” 

States Co-Finder of Cure 



SNIFFLES SNIPED; SINGLE SHOT TO SAVE 
SNEEZERS 



In medical circles, it was called 
the Coffin Multicentric Upper Re- 
spiratory Virus-inhibiting Vaccine, 
but the newspapers could never 
stand for such high-sounding 
names and called it, instead, “The 
Coffin Cure.” 

Below the banner heads, world- 
renowned feature writers ex- 
pounded in awesome terms the 
story of the leviathan struggle of 
Dr. Chauncey Patrick Coffin (et 
al .) in solving this riddle of the 
ages: 

How, after years of failure, they 
ultimately succeeded in culturing 
the true causative agent of the 
common cold, identifying it not as 
a single virus or even a group of 
viruses, but rather as a multicen- 
tric virus complex invading the 
soft mucous linings of the nose, 
throat and eyes, capable of alter- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ing its basic molecular structure 
at any time to resist efforts of the 
body from within, or the physi- 
cian from without, to attack and 
dispel it; how the hypothesis was 
set forth by Dr. Phillip Dawson 
that the virus could be destroyed 
only by an antibody which could 
“freeze” the virus-complex in one 
form long enough for normal 
body defenses to dispose of the 
offending invader; the exhausting 
search for such a “crippling agent” 
and the final crowning success, 
after injecting untold gallons of 
cold-virus material into the hides 
of a group of cooperative dogs (a 
species which had never suffered 
from colds and hence endured the 
whole business with an air of af- 
fectionate boredom). 

And, finally, the testing. First, 
Coffin himself (who was suffering 
a particularly horrendous case of 
the affliction he sought to cure); 
then his assistants, Phillip Daw- 
son and Jacob Miles; then a mul- 
titude of students from the Uni- 
versity — carefully selected for 
the severity of their symptoms, 
the longevity of their colds, their 
tendency to acquire them on little 
or no provocation, and their utter 
inabilty to get rid of them with 
any known medical program. 

They were a sorry spectacle, 
those students filing through the 
Coffin laboratory for three days in 
October: wheezing like steam 

shovels, snorting and sneezing and 



sniffling and blowing, coughing 
and squeaking, mute appeals 
glowing in their bloodshot eyes. 
The researchers dispensed the 
material — a single shot in the 
right arm, a sensitivity control in 
the left. 

TY7ITH growing delight, they 
** then watched as the results 
came in. The sneezing stopped; 
the sniffling ceased. A great si- 
lence settled over the campus, in 
the classrooms, in the library, in 
classic halls. Dr. Coffin’s voice re- 
turned (rather to the regret of 
his co-workers) and he began 
bouncing about the laboratory 
like a small boy at the fair. Stu- 
dents by the dozen trooped in for 
checkups with noses dry and eyes 
bright. 

In a matter of days, there was 
no doubt left that the goal had 
been reached. 

“But we have to be sure,” Phil- 
lip Dawson had said emphati- 
cally. “This was only the pilot 
test. We need mass testing now 
on an entire community. We 
ougt to go to the West Coast to 
run studies — they have a differ- 
ent breed of cold out there, I hear. 
We’ll have to see how long the 
immunity lasts, make sure there 
are no unexpected side effects. .” 
And, muttering to himself, he fell 
to work with pad and pencil, cal- 
culating the program to be under- 
taken before publication. 



THE COFFIN CURE 



93 




But there were rumors. Under- 
wood at Stanford, it was said, had 
already completed his tests and 
was preparing a paper for publi- 
cation in a matter of months. 
Surely, with such dramatic results 
on the pilot tests, something could 
be put into print. It would be 
tragic to lose the race for the sake 
of a little unnecessary caution. 

Phillip Dawson, though ada- 
mant, was a voice crying in the 
wilderness, for Chauncey Coffin 
was boss. 

Within a week, though, even 
Coffin was wondering if he had 
bitten off just a trifle too much. 
They had expected that the de- 
mand for the vaccine would be 
great — but even the grisly mem- 
ory of the early days of the Salk 
vaccine had not prepared them 
for the mobs of sneezing, wheez- 
ing, red-eyed people bombarding 
them for the first fruits. 

Clear-eyed young men from the 
Government Bureau pushed 
through crowds of local townspeo- 
ple, lining the streets outside the 
Coffin laboratory, standing in 
pouring rain to raise insistent 
placards. 

Seventeen pharmaceutical 
houses descended with production 
plans, cost estimates, colorful 
graphs demonstrating proposed 
yield and distribution programs. 

Coffin was flown to Washing- 
ton, where conferences labored 
far into the night as demands 

94 



pounded their doors like a tidal 
wave. 

One laboratory promised the 
vaccine in ten days; another guar- 
anteed it in a week. The first ac- 
tually appeared in three weeks 
and two days, to be soaked up in 
the space of three hours by the 
thirsty sponge of cold-weary hu- 
manity. Express planes were dis- 
patched to Europe, to Asia, to 
Africa with the precious cargo, a 
million needles pierced a million 
hides, and with a huge, convulsive 
sneeze, mankind stepped forth 
into a new era. 

'T'HERE were abstainers, of 
course — there always are: 

“It doesd’t bake eddy differets 
how buch you talk,” Ellie Dawson 
cried hoarsely, shaking her blonde 
curls. “I dod’t wadt eddy cold 
shots.” 

“You’re being totally unreason- 
able,” Phillip said, glowering at 
his wife in annoyance. She wasn’t 
the sweet young thing he had 
married, not this evening. Her 
eyes were puffy, her nose red and 
sore. “You’ve had this cold for 
two solid months now and there 
just isn’t any sense to it. It’s mak- 
ing you miserable. You can’t eat, 
you can’t breathe, you can’t 
sleep — ” 

“I dod’t wadt eddy cold shots,” 
she repeated stubbornly. 

“But why not? Just one little 
needle. You’d hardly feel it — ” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“But I dod’t like deedles!” she 
cried, bursting into tears. “Why 
dod’t you leave be alode? Go take 
your dasty old deedles ad stick 
theb id people that wadt theb.” 
“Aw, Ellie — ■” 

“I dod’t care, I dod’t like dee- 
dles!” she wailed, burying her face 
in his shirt. 

He held her close, kissing her 
ear and making comforting lit- 
tle noises. It was no use, he re- 
flected sadly. Science just wasn’t 
Ellie’s long suit; she didn’t know 
a cold vaccine from a case of 
smallpox, and no appeal to logic 
or common sense could surmount 
her irrational fear of hypodermics. 
“All right, sweet, nobody’s going 
to make you do anything you 
don’t want to.” 

“Ad eddyway, thik of the poor 
tissue badufacturers,” she sniffled, 
wiping her nose with a pink facial 
tissue. “All their little childred 
starvig to death — ” 

“Say, you have got a cold,” said 
Phillip, sniffing. “You’re wearing 
enough perfume to fell an ox.” He 
wiped away her tears and grinned 
at her. “Come on now, fix your 
face. Dinner at the Driftwood? I 
hear they have marvelous lamb 
chops.” 

It was a mellow evening. The 
lamb chops were delectable — far 
the best he had ever eaten, he 
thought, even with as good a cook 
as Ellie for a spouse. Ellie dripped 
and blew continuously, but re- 



fused to go home until they had 
taken in a movie and stopped by 
to dance a while. 

“I hardly ever gedt to see you 
eddy bore,” she wistfully ex- 
plained. “All because of that dasty 
bedicide you’re givig people.” 

It was true, of course. The 
work at the lab was endless. They 
danced, but came home early 
nevertheless. Phillip needed all 
the sleep he could get. 

He awoke once during the 
night to a parade of sneezes from 
his wife, and rolled over, frown- 
ing sleepily to himself. It was ig- 
nominious, in a way — the wife of 
one of the cold-cure discoverers 
refusing the fruit of all those 
months of work. 

And cold or no cold, she surely 
was using a whale of a lot of 
perfume. 

TTE AWOKE suddenly, began 
to stretch, and sat bolt up- 
right in bed, looking wildly about 
the room. Pale morning sunlight 
drifted in the window. Down- 
stairs, he heard Ellie stirring in 
the kitchen. 

For a moment, he thought he 
was suffocating. He leaped out of 
bed, stared at the vanity table 
across the room. “Somebody’s 
spilled the whole damned bot- 
tle — ” 

The heavy sick-sweet miasma 
hung like a cloud around him, 
drenching the room. With every 



THE COFFIN CURE 



95 




breath, it grew thicker. He 
searched the vanity top franti- 
cally, but there were no open bot- 
tles. 

His head began to spin from 
the emetic effluvium. 

He blinked in confusion, his 
hand trembling as he lit a ciga- 
rette. No need to panic, he 
thought. She probably knocked a 
bottle over when she was dress- 
ing. He took a deep puff — and 
burst into a paroxysm of coughing 
as acrid fumes burned down his 
throat to his lungs. 

“Ellie!” He rushed into the hall, 
still coughing. The match smell 
had given way to a caustic stench 
of burning weeds. He stared at 
his cigarette in horror and threw 
it into the sink. The odor grew 
worse. He threw open the hall 
closet, expecting smoke to come 
billowing out. 

“Ellie! Somebody’s burning 
down the house!” 

“Whadtever are you talkig 
aboudt?” Ellie’s voice came from 
the stair well. “It’s just the toast I 
burned, silly.” 

He rushed down the stairs two 
at a time — and nearly gagged as 
he reached the bottom. The smell 
of hot, rancid grease struck him 
like a solid wall. It was intermin- 
gled with an overpowering oily 
smell of boiled and parboiled 
coffee. By the time he reached the 
kitchen, he was holding his nose, 
tears pouring from his eyes. 



“Ellie, what are you doing in 
here?” 

She stared at him. “IT* baking 
breakfast.” 

“But don’t you smell it?” 

On the stove, the automatic 
percolator made small, promising 
noises. Four sunnyside eggs were 
sizzling in the frying pan; half a 
dozen strips of bacon drained on 
a paper towel on the sideboard. It 
couldn’t have looked more inno- 
cent. 

Cautiously, Phillip released his 
nose, sniffed. The stench nearly 
strangled him. “You mean you 
don’t smell anything strange?” 

“I dod’t sbell eddythig, period,” 
said Ellie defensively. 

“The coffee, the bacon — come 
here a minute!” 

She reeked — of bacon, of cof- 
fee, of burned toast, but mostly of 
perfume. 

“Did you put on fresh perfume 
this morning?” 

“Before breakfast? Dod’t be ri- 
diculous.” 

“Not even a drop?” Phillip was 
turning very white. 

“Dot a drop.” 

13HILLIP shook his head. “Now 
wait a minute. This must be 
all in my mind. I’m — just im- 
agining things, that’s all. Working 
too hard, hysterical reaction. In a 
minute, it’ll all go away.” He 
poured a cup of coffee, added 
cream and sugar.

He couldn’t get it close enough 
to taste it. It smelled as if it had 
been boiling three weeks in a 
rancid pot. It was the smell of 
coffee, all right, but a smell that 
was fiendishly distorted, overpow- 
eringly and nauseatingly magni- 
fied. It pervaded the room and 
burned his throat and brought 
tears gushing to his eyes. 

Slowly, realization began to 
dawn. He spilled the coffee as he 
set the cup down. The perfume. 
The coffee. The cigarette. 

“My hat,” he choked. “Get me 
my hat. I’ve got to get to the 
laboratory.” 

It grew worse all the way 
downtown. He fought down nau- 
sea as the smell of damp, rotting 
earth rose from his front yard in 
a gray cloud. The neighbor’s dog 
dashed out to greet him, exuding 
the great-grandfather of all dog 
odors. While Phillip waited for 
the bus, every passing car fouled 
the air with noxious fumes, gag- 
ging him, doubling him up with 
coughing as he dabbed at his 
streaming eyes. 

Nobody else seemed to notice 
anything wrong at all. 

The bus ride was a nightmare. 
It was a damp, rainy day; the in- 
side of the bus smelled like the 
locker room after a big game. A 
bleary-eyed man with three-days’ 
stubble on his chin flopped down 
in the seat next to him, and Phil- 
lip reeled back in memory to the 



job he had held in his student 
days, cleaning vats in the brewery. 

“It’sh a great morning,” Bleary- 
eyes breathed at him. “Huh, Doc?” 
Phillip blanched. To top it, the 
man had had a breakfast of sa- 
lami. In the seat ahead, a fat gen- 
tleman held a dead cigar clamped 
in his mouth like a rank growth. 
Phillip’s stomach began rolling; 
he sank his face into his hand, 
trying unobtrusively to clamp his 
nostrils. With a groan of deliver- 
ance, he lurched off the bus at the 
laboratory gate. 

He met Jake Miles coming up 
the steps. Jake looked pale, too 
pale. 

“Morning,” Phillip said weakly. 
“Nice day. Looks like the Sun 
might come through.” 

“Yeah,” said Jake. “Nice day. 
You — uh — feel all right this 
morning?” 

INE, fine.” Phillip tossed his 
hat in the closet, opened the 
incubator on his culture tubes, 
trying to look busy. He slammed 
the door after one whiff and 
gripped the edge of the work 
table with whitening knuckles. 
“Why do you ask?” 

“Oh, nothing. Thought you 
looked a little peaked, was all.” 
They stared at each other in 
silence. Then, as though by sig- 
nal, their eyes turned to the office 
at the end of the lab. 

“Coffin come in yet?” 



THE COFFIN CURE 



97 




Jake nodded. “He’s in there. 
He’s got the door locked.” 

“I think he’s going to have to 
open it,” said Phillip. 

A gray-faced Dr. Coffin un- 
locked the door, backed quickly 
toward the wall. The room reeked 
of kitchen deodorant. 

“Stay right where you are,” 
Coffin squeaked. “Don’t come a 
step closer. I can’t see you now. 
I’m — I’m busy. I’ve got work 
that has to be done — ” 

“You’re telling me,” growled 
Phillip. He motioned Jake into 
the office and locked the door 
again carefully. Then he turned 
to Coffin. “When did it start for 
you?” 

Coffin was trembling. “Right 
after supper last night. I thought 
I was going to suffocate. Got up 
and walked the streets all night. 
My God, what a stink!” 

“Jake?” 

Dr. Miles shook his head. 
“Sometime this morning. I woke 
up with it.” 

“That’s when it hit me,” said 
Phillip. 

“But I don’t understand,” Cof- 
fin howled. “Nobody else seems 
to notice anything — ” 

“Yet,” Phillip said. “We were 
the first three to take the Coffin 
Cure, remember? You and me 
and Jake. Two months ago.” 
Coffin’s forehead was beaded 
with sweat. He stared at the two 
men in growing horror. 

98 



“ But what about the others ?” 
“I think,” said Phillip, “that 
we’d better find something spec- 
tacular to do in a mighty big 
hurry. That’s what I think.” 

J AKE MILES said, “The most 
important thing right now is 
secrecy. We mustn’t let a word 
get out — not until we’re abso- 
lutely certain.” 

“But what’s happened ?” Coffin 
cried. “These foul smells every- 
where. You, Phillip — you had a 
cigarette this morning. I can smell 
it clear over here and it’s burning 
my eyes. If I didn’t know better, 
I’d swear neither of you had had 
a bath in a week. Every odor in 
town has suddenly turned foul — ” 
“Magnified, you mean,” said 
Jake. “Perfume still smells sweet 
— there’s just too much of it. The 
same with cinnamon; I tried it. 
Cried for half an hour, but it still 
smelled like cinnamon. No, I don’t 
think the smells have changed 
any.” 

“But what then?” 

“Our noses have changed, obvi- 
ously.” Jake paced the floor in 
excitement. “Look at our dogs. 
They’ve never had colds — and 
they practically live by their 
noses. Other animals — all depen- 
dent on their senses of smell for 
survival — and none of them ever 
have anything even vaguely remi- 
niscent of a common cold. The 
multicentric virus hits primates 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




only — and it reaches its fullest 
parasitic powers in Man alone!” 

Coffin shook his head miser- 
ably. “But why this horrible reek 
all of a sudden? I haven’t had a 
cold in weeks — ” 

“Of course not! That’s just what 
I’m saying,” Jake persisted. “Look, 
why do we have any sense of 
smell at all? Because we have 
tiny olfactory nerve endings bur- 
ied in the mucous membrane of 
our noses and throats. But we’ve 
always had the virus living there, 
too, colds or no colds, throughout 
our entire lifetime. It’s always 
been there, -anchored in the same 
cells, parasitizing the same sensi- 
tive tissues that carry our olfac- 
tory nerve endings, numbing them 
and crippling them, making them 
practically useless as sensory or- 
gans. No wonder we never 
smelled anything before! Those 
poor little nerve endings never 
had a chance!” 

“Until we came along and de- 
stroyed the virus,” said Phillip. 

“Oh, we didn’t destroy it. We 
merely stripped it of a very slip- 
pery protective mechanism it had 
against normal body defenses.” 
Jake perched on the edge of the 
desk, his dark face intense. “These 
two months since we had our 
shots have witnessed a battle to 
the death between our bodies and 
the virus. With the help of the 
vaccine, our bodies have won, 
that’s all — stripped away the last 

THE COFFIN CURE 



strongholds of an invader that 
has been almost a part of our nor- 
mal physiology since the begin- 
ning of primates. And now, for 
the first time, those crippled little 
nerve endings are just beginning 
to function.” 

OFFIN groaned. “God help 
^ us. You think it’ll get worse?” 
“And worse. And still worse,” 
said Jake. 

“I wonder,” said Phillip slowly, 
“what the anthropologists will 
say.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Maybe it was just a single 
mutation somewhere back in pre- 
history. Just a tiny change of me- 
tabolism that left one line of the 
primates vulnerable to an invader 
no other would harbor. Why else 
should Man have begun to flower 
and blossom intellectually-— grow 
to depend so much on his brains 
instead of his brawn that he could 
rise above all others? What bet- 
ter reason than because, some- 
where along the line, he suddenly 
lost his sense of smell?” 

“Well, he’s got it back again 
now,” Coffin said despairingly, 
“and he’s not going to like it a 
bit.” 

“No, he surely isn’t,” Jake 
agreed. “He’s going to start hunt- 
ing very quickly for someone to 
blame, I think.” 

They both looked at Coffin. 
“Now don’t be ridiculous, boys,” 

99 




said Coffin, beginning to shake. 
“We’re in this together. Phillip, it 
was your idea in the first place — 
you said so yourself! You can't 
leave me now — ” 

The telephone jangled. The 
frightened voice of the secretary 
bleated, “Dr. Coffin? There was a 
student on the line just a moment 
ago. He — he said he was coming 
up to see you. Now, he said, not 
later — ” 

“I’m busy,” Coffin sputtered. “I 
can’t see anyone. And I can’t take 
any calls — ■’* 

“But he’s already on his way 
up,” the girl burst out. “He was 
saying something about tearing 
you apart with his bare hands.” 
Coffin slammed down the re- 
ceiver. His face was the color of 
clay. “They’ll crucify me! Jake — 
Phillip — you’ve got to help me!” 
Phillip sighed and unlocked the 
door. “Send a girl down to the 
freezer and have her bring up all 
the live cold virus she can find. 
Get us some inoculated monkeys 
and a few dozen dogs.” He turned 
to Coffin. “And stop sniveling. 
You’re the big publicity man 
around here — you’re going to 
handle the screaming masses, 
whether you like it or not.” 

“But what are you going to 
do?” 

“I haven’t the faintest idea,” 
said Phillip, “but whatever I do is 
going to cost you your shirt. 
We’re going to find out how to 

100 



catch cold again if we have to die 
trying.” 

I T WAS an admirable struggle, 
and a futile one. They sprayed 
their noses and throats with 
enough pure culture of virulent 
live virus to have condemned an 
ordinary man to a lifetime of 
sneezing, watery-eyed misery. 
They didn’t develop a sniffle 
among them. 

They mixed six different strains 
of virus and gargled the extract, 
spraying themselves and every in- 
oculated monkey they could get 
their hands on with the vile-smell- 
ing stuff. Not a sneeze. 

They injected it hypodermi- 
cally, intradermally, subcutane- 
ously, intramuscularly and intra- 
venously. They drank it. They 
bathed in it. 

But they didn’t catch a cold. 
“Maybe it’s the wrong ap- 
proach,” Jake said one morning. 
“Our body defenses are keyed up 
to top performance right now. 
Maybe if we break them down, 
we can get somewhere.” 

They plunged down that alley 
with grim abandon. They starved 
themselves. They forced them- 
selves to stay awake for days on 
end, until exhaustion forced their 
eyes closed in spite of all they 
could do. They carefully devised 
vitamin-free, protein-free, miner- 
al-free diets that tasted like li- 
brary paste and smelled worse. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




They wore wet clothes and sop- 
ping shoes to work, turned off the 
heat and threw windows open to 
the raw winter air. Then they re- 
sprayed themselves with the live 
cold virus and waited prayerfully 
for the sneezing to begin. 

It didn’t. They stared at each 
other in gathering gloom. They’d 
never felt better in their lives. 

Except for the smells, of course. 
They’d hoped that they might, 
presently, get used to them. They 
didn’t. Every day it grew a little 
worse. They began smelling 
smells they never dreamed existed 
— noxious smells, cloying smells, 
smells that drove them gagging to 
the sinks. Their nose-plugs were 
rapidly losing their effectiveness. 
Mealtimes were nightmarish or- 
deals; they lost weight with 
alarming speed. 

But they didn’t catch cold. 

“I think you should all be 
locked up,” Ellie Dawson said se- 
verely as she dragged her hus- 
band, blue-faced and shivering, 
out of an icy shower one bitter 
morning. “You’ve lost your wits. 
You need to be protected against 
yourselves, that’s what you need.” 
“You don’t understand,” Phil- 
lip moaned. “We’ve got to catch 
cold.” 

LLIE snapped angrily, “Why? 

Suppose you don’t — what’s 
going to happen?” 

“We had three hundred stu- 



dents march on the laboratory to- 
day,” Phillip explained patiently. 
“The smells were driving them 
crazy, they said. They couldn’t 
even bear to be close to their best 
friends. They wanted something 
done about it, or else they wanted 
blood. Tomorrow we’ll have them 
back and three hundred more. 
And they were just the pilot 
study! What’s going to happen 
when fifteen million people find 
their noses suddenly turning on 
them?” 

He shuddered. “Have you seen 
the papers? People are already 
going around sniffing like blood- 
hounds. And now we’re finding 
out what a thorough job we did. 
We can’t crack it, Ellie. We can’t 
even get a toe hold. Those anti- 
bodies are just doing too good a 
job.” 

“Well, maybe you can find 
some unclebodies to take care of 
them,” Ellie offered vaguely. 

“Look, don’t make bad jokes — ” 
“I’m not making jokes! I don’t 
care what you do. All I want is a 
husband back who doesn’t com- 
plain about how everything smells, 
and eats the dinners I cook, and 
doesn’t stand around in cold 
showers at six in the morning.” 

“I know it’s miserable,” he said 
helplessly. “But I don’t know how 
we can stop it.” 

He found Jake and Coffin in 
tight-lipped conference when he 
reached the lab. 



THE COFFIN CURE 



101 




“I can’t do it any more ” Coffin 
was saying. “I’ve begged them for 
time. I’ve promised them every- 
thing but my upper plate. I can’t 
face them again. I just can’t.” 

“We only have a few days left,” 
Jake said grimly. “If we don’t 
come up with something, we’re 
goners.” 

Phillip’s jaw suddenly sagged 
as he stared at them. “You know 
what I think?” he asked suddenly. 
“I think we’ve been prize idiots. 
We’ve gotten so rattled, we 
haven’t used our heads. And all 
the time it’s been sitting there 
blinking at us!” 

“What are you talking about?” 
snapped Jake. 

“Unclebodies,” said Phillip. 

“Great God!” 

“No, I’m dead serious.” Phil- 
lip’s eyes were very bright. “How 
many of those students do you 
think you can corral to help us?” 

Coffin gulped. “Six hundred. 
They’re out there in the street 
right now, a blood-seeking mob 
howling for a lynching.” 

“All right, I want them in here. 
And I want some monkeys. Mon- 
keys with colds — the worse colds, 
the better.” 

“Do you have any idea what 
you’re doing?” asked Jake. 

“None in the least,” said Phil- 
lip happily, “except that it’s never 
been done before. But maybe it’s 
time we tried following our noses 
for a while — ” 



**1 'HE tidal wave began to break 
two days later . only a few 
people here, a dozen there, but 
enough to confirm the direst 
newspaper predictions. The boom- 
erang was completing its circle. 

At the laboratory, the doors 
were kept barred, the telephones 
disconnected. Within, there was a 
bustle of feverish — if odorous — 
activity. For the three research- 
ers, the olfactory acuity had 
reached agonizing proportions. 
Even the small gas masks Phillip 
had devised could no longer 
shield them from the continuous 
barrage of violent odors. 

But the work went on in spite 
of the smell. Truckloads of mon- 
keys arrived at the lab — cold- 
ridden, sneezing, coughing, weep- 
ing, wheezing monkeys by the 
dozen. Culture trays bulged with 
tubes, overflowed the incubators 
and work tables. Each day six 
hundred angry students paraded 
through the lab, arms exposed, 
mouths open, grumbling but co- 
operating. 

At the end of the first week, 
half the monkeys were cured of 
their colds and were unable to 
catch them back; the other half 
had new colds and couldn't get rid 
of them. Phillip observed this fact 
with grim satisfaction and went 
about the laboratory mumbling to 
himself. 

Two days later, he burst forth 
jubilantly, lugging a sad-looking

puppy under his arm. It was like 
no other puppy in the world. This 
one was sneezing and snuffling 
with a perfect howler of a cold. 

The day came when they in- 
jected a tiny droplet of milky 
fluid beneath the skin of Phillip’s 
arm and got the virus spray and 
gave his nose and throat a liberal 
application. Then they sat back 
and waited. 

They were still waiting three 
days later. 

“It was a great idea,” Jake said 
morosely, flipping a bulging note- 
book closed with finality. “It just 
didn’t work, was all.” 

“Where’s Coffin?” 

“He collapsed three days ago. 
Nervous prostration. He kept hav- 
ing dreams about hangings.” 

Phillip sighed. “Well, I suppose 
we’d better just face it. Nice 
knowing you, Jake. Pity it had to 
be this way.” 

“It was a great try, old man. A 
great try.” 

“Ah, yes. Nothing like going 
down in a blaze of — •” 

Phillip stopped dead, his eyes 
widening. His nose began to 
twitch. He took a gasp, a larger 
gasp, as a long-dead reflex came 
sleepily to life, shook its head, 
reared back. 

Phillip sneezed. 

He sneezed for ten minutes 
without a pause, until he was 
blue-faced and gasping for air. He 
caught hold of Jake, wringing his 



hand as tears gushed from his 
eyes. 

46|r WAS a sibple edough prid- 
ciple he said later to Ellie 
as she spread mustard on his 
chest and poured more warm 
water into his foot bath. “The 
Cure itself depedded upod it — 
the adtiged-adtibody reactiod. We 
had the adtibody agaidst the virus, 
all ridght; what we had to find 
was sobe kide of adtibody agaidst 
the adtibody.” He sneezed vio- 
lently and poured in nose drops 
with a happy grin. 

“Will they be able to make it 
fast enough?” 

“Just aboudt fast edough for 
people to get good ad eager to 
catch cold agaid,” said Phillip. 
“There’s odly wud little hitch. .” 

Ellie Dawson, took the steaks 
from the grill and set them, still 
sizzling, on the dinner table. 

“Hitch?” she said. 

Phillip nodded as he chewed 
the steak with a pretense of en- 
thusiasm. It tasted like slightly 
damp K-ration. 

“This stuff we’ve bade does a 
real good job. Just a little too 
good.” He wiped his nose and 
reached for a fresh tissue. 

“I bay be wrog, but I thik I’ve 
got this cold for keeps,” he said 
sadly. “Udless I cad fide ad adti-

THE BIG BALL OF WAX by 
Shepherd Mead. Ballantine

B allantine has done a 

large service by reissuing 
Mead’s 1954 work of art. If you 
haven’t yet read it, don’t let it 
get away. Gravy Planet, Preferred 
Risk and Golden Kazoo told their 
yarns fairly straight; Mead coats 
his horror story with laughter. 

Example: “I’m worried about 
Mabel.” “Who’s Mabel?” “She’s 
the Muscular Dystrophy girl.” 
“Can’t she walk at all?” “She

EXPLORING MARS by Roy A. 
Gallant. Garden City Books, 
N. Y., $2.00 

T> ECAUSE of the close ap- 
proach of Mars last Septem- 
ber, it could only be expected that 
the market would be flooded by 
factual texts for the layman. The 
tide is now receding, leaving the 
following two items in its ebb. 

Exploring Mars can claim the 
heavyweight title. The various 
publishing houses seem to have 
had an unofficial competition to 
see who could produce the un- 
wieldiest volume. Until now, 
Albro Gaul’s and the Ley-Braun 
entries have shared the crown. 
But not any more. 



A full 12 Vz inches high by 9 
wide, this new champ is fortu- 
nately redeemed by its maps and 
illustrations by Lowell Hess. Just 
make sure your youngster is at 
least as big as the book before 
you buy it. 

THERE IS LIFE ON MARS 
by the Earl Nelson. The Citadel 
Press, N. Y., $3.00 

D ESPITE the petulant title, 
Albert, the Earl Nelson, de- 
scendant of the famous Admiral, 
has written a scholarly summing- 
up that, though containing noth- 
ing new and startling, is quite 
readable. And fear not — the 
“life” referred to so dramatically 
is merely the moss and lichen of 
contemporary theory, not the in- 
telligent life of Percival Lowell 
and H. G. Wells. 

IN SEARCH OF WONDER by 
Damon Knight. Advent: Publish- 
ers , Chicago, $4.00 

A COLLECTION of critical 
essays devoted solely to the 
field of science-fantasy. Anthony 
Boucher, in his foreword, admires 
the hatchet job Knight does on 
Austin Hall, among others. That’s 
no hatchet — it’s an axe, swung 
by a man with more than his 
share of axes to grind, and used 
on a very early writer of science 
fiction for whom even a fly-swat-

ter would be a needlessly brutal 
weapon. 

Boucher declares that all the 
rest of us are reviewers; Knight 
alone is a critic. True enough, 
the function of these pages is to 
point out worthy books and warn 
against duds. True, too, we can’t 
afford the luxury of informing our 
readers how we would have 
written any item, including 
Knight’s. Nor do we judge books 
in terms of authors’ personal 
tastes and habits. 

Then again, aren’t we lucky 
that not every story is written 
in Knight’s brilliantly metallic 
style, enjoyable and rewarding 
though it is?

THE RAPE OF THE MIND by

Publishing Co., Cleveland and 
N. Y., $5.00 

* | ’HE Reichstag Trials in 1933 
didn’t raise too many ques- 
tions because of the Nazis’ choice 
of an idiot scapegoat, but the 
world was astounded by the spec- 
tacle of former heroes renouncing 
their ideology and confessing to 
treason in the Moscow Trials of 
the ’30s. 

The comparatively crude Nazi 
torture methods and the consid- 

106 



erably refined techniques evolved 
during the Korean War point up 
the new horrors of modern war- 
fare, atrocities never covered by 
the Geneva Convention. 

Dr. Meerloo underwent two 
and a half years of the Nazi oc- 
cupation before he escaped to 
become Chief of the Psychologi- 
cal Dept, of the Netherlands 
Forces. 

He has written a sobering book, 
but one with a message of hope 
for the budding science of the 
human mind.

also includes “Symbiotica,” 
“ Meehan is tria” and “Mesmerica.” 
Substantial space opera all, but 
badly anti-climactic after the im-

Incidentally, I believe Russell’s

T HESE two gentlemen have 
been busy bees this year, re- 
sponsible for the monumental 
The Moon, as well as Dr. Wilkins’ 
solo Moons, Rings and Croco- 
diles. 

I approached the present vol- 
ume avidly, expecting the authors 
to pull a telescope out of the hat 
for me. 

But it takes a good home 
workshop to be able to follow the 
authors’ detailed instructions. 
Don’t tackle this unless you’re 
really well equipped. If you are — 
well, I envy you. 

EXPLORING THE DEEP PA- 
CIFIC by Helen Raitt W. W. 
Norton & Co. Inc., N. Y., $3.75 

A GOOD many authors are 
pretty glib about throwing 
women into the austerely mascu- 
line environment of a spaceship. 
Mrs. Raitt’s experiences make an 
excellent parallel, since, on a sci- 
entific expedition, weeks can go 
by between landings, during which 
time the ship is a world by itself 
— though Mrs. Raitt had nothing 
of the sort in mind, just a straight 
reportorial job on a woman in 
essentially a man’s world. A re- 
freshing view of a workhorse 
charting expedition. 



RISK AND GAMBLING : THE 
STUDY OF SUBJECTIVE 
PROBABILITY by John Cohen 
and Mark Hansel. Philosophical 
Library, N. Y., $3.50 

TF THE layman reader isn’t in- 
timidated by numerous tables 
and charts, he is certain to find 
here some appetizing food for 
thought: “Predicting the Un- 

known,” “Sampling the Universe,” 
“Risk-taking,” “The Language of 
Uncertainty.” 

The text does not concern ef- 
forts to influence, as per Dr. 
Rhine, but rather the reasoning 
processes of the human brain 
when confronted with uncertain- 
ties.

$2.50 

rpHE JACKET blurb says this 
book is likely to bring to an 
end the long conflict between the 
Bible and science. I doubt it. The 
battle still rages over present-day 
sightings, let alone Biblical re- 
porting. Nevertheless, the book is 
perversely exciting. Could the 
Bible have been written as the 
result of a series of visitations?

** A TRIM-a the dish,” he 
/% said. He slid his eyes 
/ m from the puddle mi- 
rages on the streaming concrete 
to the girl beside him in the open 
convertible. Again he wished he 
were a painter; in a few clean 
lines, one might abstract perfec- 
tion. 

“What?” Clean lines curved his 
way. 

“A trim-a the dish. That’s you. 
A trim dish. Play on words. *To 
trim the dish’ is to put a vessel on 
an even keel ” 

She smiled. “We’re all-out nau- 



tical today, I see.” 

He was about to say something 
about how good it would be to get 
out on the Sound again when a 
black mass with streaks of coral 
flashed abreast on the right, cut 
across his lane, outstripped the car 
obliquely ahead, cut sharply 
back, and continued in and out of 
the two lanes. 

“That crazy idiot! You see 
that, Pauline? He nearly clipped 
me!” He was scandalized. His eyes 
hardened. “That guy needs a good 
lesson.” 

Pauline said nothing.

The steering wheel seemed to 
pulse as his grip tightened. He 
pressed the horn ring until the 
car ahead swung into the right- 
hand lane. 

“Admiral Hornblower,” Pauline 
said. She placed her left hand 
across his white knuckles. The 
diamond solitaire exploded minia- 
ture fireworks. “Let him go.” Her 
hand withdrew. 

He bore down on the gas pedal. 
The ends of his tie whipped out 
like pennants and the scarf cov- 
ering her hair like a windsock. He 
fumed as cars gave way sluggishly 
under the goading of his horn. He 
knew he was spotting the black- 
and-coral car a growing lead by 
observing the rules its driver 
flouted. 

"PAULINE brought the flutter- 
ing ends of his tie down from 
his face and held them lightly 
against his chest. “Come on, Cor- 
bet. Chances are he has a reason 
to be in a rush.” 

He slowed. “Maybe.” Anyway, 
the black-and-coral car was no- 
where in sight. 

“I’ll get you a tie clip I saw. 
Shaped like an anchor. Promise 
you’ll wear it?” 

“Promise.” 

They passed the half moon of 
a service station. He saw the 
black-and-coral car gassing up. 
The driver was standing beside it 
with his hands locked behind his

head, yawning. The creep had all 
the time in the world. Pauline 
gave no sign that she had seen 
the car. Corbet smiled to himself. 
He kept flicking his eyes to the 
rear-view mirror. 

In a few minutes, it showed 
black-and-coral zigzagging, ex- 
panding. Corbet pulled even with 
a car in the slow lane and held 
his speed down. The black-and- 
coral car was behind him now, 
giving him the horn. He paced the 
car alongside lovingly, effectively 
blocking the black-and-coral car. 

He could feel Pauline’s eyes on 
him. She said, “Someone wants to 
pass.” 

“Really?” 

Pauline gazed at him a moment 
longer, then twisted to look back. 
“Oh.” She faced forward again. 

“Oh is right.” The bleating be- 
came a high-pitched drone. He 
smiled. “ There’s your Admiral 
Hornblower.” 

“This is childish.” She drew 
away from him and sat stiffly. 

He darted a look at her. The 
look went past her to the driver 
of the car alongside. The driver 
was staring at him curiously. Cor- 
bet flushed and concentrated on 
the road ahead. Look, buddy, Tm 
showing a wise guy he doesn’t 
own the road. 

A jolting impact from behind 
snapped Corbet and Pauline back 
against the seat. Corbet paled. He 
grimly held to his thwarting tac- 

109 




tic. Another jolt, harder. The devil 
was deliberately ramming them. 

Pauline said, “Oh, let him pass.” 

“No,” he said angrily. 

The jolts came with the mono- 
tony of a drumbeat, hard but not 
hard enough to lock bumpers. In 
spite of himself, Corbet began to 
grin foolishly. It was childish. He 
wondered how he could end it 
gracefully. On cue, the car along- 
side turned off into a side road. 

The b!ack-and-coral car swung 
into the space and matched Cor- 
bet’s speed. Dark eyes in a pasty 
face turned toward them. The 
eyes moved from Corbet to Pau- 
line and locked. 

“Hello, baby,” the driver said 
in a shrill, excited voice. 

He accelerated. A twist of the 
wheel cut his car at theirs. 

Z"' 1 ORBET’S foot kicked in des- 
^ perate reflex from gas to 
brake and his hands wrenched the 
wheel. The black-and-coral car 
surged away. High laughing 
drifted back. Corbet’s foot trod 
from brake to gas. 

Banners of a punitive expedi- 
tion, his tie ends fluttered against 
his face. His lips moved, urging 
the car on. Pauline looked up to 
heaven, then closed her eyes, her 
mouth curved in a bitter smile. 

They were coming to the cross- 
ing where he had to make a right 
turn to reach the marina where 
they docked their cabin cruiser. 

no 



He hesitated the splith of a sec- 
ond, then kept straight on after 
the black-and-coral car. 

The wheels spun a sticky sound; 
the state’s responsibility had 
ended and a tar-surfaced stretch 
began. Childish thoughts were the 
order of the day? All right, then 
— he stole a glance at an ab- 
stracted Pauline — the road was 
licorice, the traffic lights cherry, 
lemon and lime drops. 

Ahead, lemon drops dirtied as 
if they had fallen and rolled into 
a coating of dust, and cherry 
drops gleamed moistly. Gloating, 
Corbet saw the black-and-coral 
car first in line under the nearest 
light. He stopped, bumper to 
bumper with the car in front, 
pulled on the hand brake and 
sprang out. 

He ran along the shoulder. It 
was only thirty yards, but he was 
afraid the light would change be- 
fore he got there. At thirty-nine, 
he was becoming more easily 
winded. He had a big frame — 
not that he was fat. Portly was 
the word. He could still punt a 
football a good distance and 
swing a mean bat. 

The smell of burned rubber 
diffused in his lungs. He made it. 
He felt like a tom-tom. He 
loomed threateningly over the 
driver. 

A frightened smile was frozen 
on the wooden face of the driver. 
Behind the carved mask, the eyes

jerked up and away. It gave Cor- 
bet an uncanny feeling. Life was 
where it didn’t belong, as if the 
eyes of a trophy head followed 
you, or as if you tore open a doll 
and shining viscera spilled out 
The man was clearly scared, but 
fear excited him and kept him 
from shrinking away from Corbet. 
The eyes looked out almost ea- 
gerly. 

Corbet wished Pauline could 
hear the mature, civilized way he 
was going to handle this. “This is 
a citizen’s arrest. I’m a lawyer, so 
I know it’s legal. I’m arresting you 
for reckless driving and taking 
you before the local magistrate. 
Let me see your license.” 

It was just as well Pauline 
couldn’t hear. His breathing was 
too ragged. It would sound better 
when he told her later. The driver 
settled his eyes for a moment on 
Corbet’s tie. 

“Come on,” Corbet said testily, 
“let me see your operator’s li- 
cense.” 

UT of the tail of an eye, 
” Corbet saw the lemon drop 
glisten as if washed off. A horn 
blew. The driver reached out sud- 
denly and seized Corbet’s tie. He 
jumped the light, pulling Corbet 
along. 

Corbet trotted awkwardly, 
clawing at the tie with mount- 
ing panic, his eyes rolling up to 
the hot glare of the Sun as the 

ARMY WITHOUT BANNERS 



driver’s fingers remained leeched 
to the tie and the car picked up 
speed. 

With a suddenness that sent 
him tripping over his own feet, he 
slipped free. He stumbled a few 
steps, then stopped and stood a 
moment, limp, sweat-logged, re- 
joicing in gulpings of gas-fumed 
air. A shrouding blur stung his 
eyes and he wiped them. His 
chest heaved in a vast ballooning 
of anger. He turned and ran back 
to his car, his heart knocking, his 
feet splatting bubbling tar of 
chewable consistency. 

Homs were sounding mad play- 
ground shrieks as traffic piled up 
behind his car. He deafened him- 
self to the horn-blowing and to 
the howling of the livid-faced 
driver jammed immediately in 
back. 

Pauline held the door open for 
him. He leaped in and slammed 
the door. 

“That tops everything,” she said 
flatly. Then a shading of concern 
rounded her voice. “You all 
right?” 

He nodded shortly, getting the 
car underway with a jerk. 

“You might’ve been killed,” she 
said flatly again. Pitch of voice 
ineffably grave, she interpreted 
his grim silence and the avenging 
flutter of chartreuse and claret. 
“Oh, no! Not again!” Clean lines 
curved away from him. 

He hunted the black-and-coral

car down, cutting in and out reck- 
lessly, gaining, burning for chance 
to reappear. Cherry drops glis- 
tened and he saw his prey stop, 
boxed in. 

He loomed above the driver. 
Anger strangling his voice, he 
said, “Out! Make it fast or I’ll 
haul you out!” 

Something manipulated the 
driver’s head now in a wide arc. 
The eyes behind the frightened 
smile weren’t black but a dark 
dark-blue. They shone excitedly. 

Corbet unlocked a fist to grab 
the door handle. Horns blew, 
gears clashed, a kaleidoscope 
spilled its fragments over the 
crossing. 

Again the man reached out and 
seized Corbet’s tie. Again the car 
leaped forward. And again Corbet 
was trotting awkwardly, clawing 
at his tie with mounting panic, 
his eyes rolling up to the white 
glare of the Sun as the driver’s 
fingers remained leeched to the 
tie and the car picked up speed. 

f X'HE spaceship, invisibly 
wrapped in light, hung high 
above the delicate embroidery of 
lanes and cloverleaf. Inside the 
spaceship, in the sick bay, the 
two medical officers gazed imper- 
sonally at the figure standing 
stiffly before them, his eyeless 
pasty mask hanging from his belt 
like one of those grisly trophies 
that the aborigines of this conti- 

ARMY WITHOUT BANNERS 



nent learned from their conquer- 
ors to value, the dark dark-blue 
eyes in his teal face staring 
blankly ahead. 

The medical officers talked 
about him as if he weren’t stand- 
ing squarely before them. And, in 
a sense, he wasn’t — they had 
switched off his mind. 

The medic with the more body 
cilia said, “No doubt about it. 
Combat fatigue. Only natural, 
considering the number of mis- 
sions he’s been on.” 

The medic with the brighter 
ears flapped them in agreement. 
“I think we must recommend that 
every agent come in sooner for 
the thorough check-up. He’s a per- 
fect case of what can happen 
when we let it go too long. Have 
you seen the films?” 

“No.” 

“Well, the camera that was on 
him while he was in action shows 
beyond question that, if he hadn’t 
lost control of himself, there were 
several times when he could have 
caused beautiful pile-ups, with 
numerous casualties. But he for- 
got the object is to set up colli- 
sions and let them do the rest. 
He disobeyed the order not to 
engage the enemy in situations 
where there’s a chance of being 
caught and discovered. Our side 
had to spirit him away under the 
very noses of their police.” 

Cilia vibrated in horror. Anx- 
iously, “Why do it this way? It’s 

113 




so damnably hard on our war- 
riors!” 

Compassionately, “What would 
you suggest?” 

“Outright invasion! Get it over 
with in a hurry, one way or the 
other, instead of a little at a time 
for year after year!” 

“Logistics is the answer. We 
can’t raise a fleet that big and 
transport as many warriors as 
we’d need or supply them over so 
great a distance.” 

“But we’d win even with a 
smaller fleet and fewer warriors!” 
Amusedly, “No doubt, but why 
gamble when it isn’t necessary? 
And it isn’t a little at a time.” 
Doubtful, but wanting to be- 
lieve, “It isn’t?” 

“No. This is the most powerful 
country on the planet and yet, 
since the invention of the inter- 
nal-combustion engine, accidents 



have taken more lives than all its 
wars combined. And the rate is 
steadily increasing. With our help, 
of course, plus their growing pro- 
ductivity. When the figures are 
large enough — that’s the time 
for outright invason. And logistics 
won’t be a problem then.” 

Ears flapped agreement. “Very 
sound plan. We’ll have the re- 
sources of the most powerful 
country as a supply base. Very 
sound.” 

“Naturally. Meanwhile, we have 
a job to do.” He gave his full at- 
tention to the figure standing 
stiffly before them. 

The other did the same. With 
sudden enthusiasm, “Just a bit of 
gland work and we’ll have him 
back in there in no time — and 
carrying out his missions accord- 
ing to orders!”

incoming planes to land else-

A jet Convex, flying deadhead 
because of motor trouble, had to 
make a forced landing in the 
New Jersey marshes. The crew 
escaped, but the craft burned, 
eliminating the need for mosquito 
control in that area during the 
rest of the summer. 

“Unfortunate,” declared the lo- 
cal Pest Comptroller, “but it’s an 
ill lack of wind that doesn’t blow

At 7:58 A.M., the S.S. Masonic 
hooted deafeningly for her berth- 
ing tugs. Surrounding themselves 
in choking smoke, the tugs hauled 
her to a pier that proved to be 
occupied by the S.S. Colonic, 
which, with steam up and tugs 
waiting in their own overhang of 
smoke to lead her downstream, 
was boxed in by the intruder and 
her tugs. Smoke and steam were 
poured into the air before the 
jam was untangled in the suffo- 
cating pall. 

Every available taxi was put 
on the streets in expectation of 
unusual business. “Stood to rea- 
son,” defended Redwing Fleet 
dispatcher Howard Williams (no 
relation to Sam Williams, chief 
fireman for Lipp Novelties). 
“People getting off work, people 



going to work, sky getting blacker 
by the minute. Sure, it was risky, 
but all hackies went real slow 
to avoid collisions. Sure, the 
meters kept running,” he retorted 
to a question put to him by a 
reporter. “You think we’re a 
charitable institution?” 

At 10:15 a.m., Dr. Richard 
Grubel, who had relieved Dr. 
Hambro at the Battery weather 
station, sent a warning through 
official channels urging the mayor 
to forbid all but the most neces- 
sary smoke production. The 
mayor called the heads of de- 
partments into conference. 

By this time, the city was com- 
pletely blacked out. Lights were 
burning in offices, homes, fac- 
tories, streets. To meet the power 
demand, every generator was put 
into operation. The mayor’s con- 
ference agreed that that was 
necessary. So were transportation, 
heating and manufacture. 

They adjourned with an order 
strictly forbidding suburbanite 
burning of rubbish. 

At 3:03 p.m, Ned Snowden, 
TV repairman, left the office of 
his physician, Jerome Black, M.D., 
having had his irritated throat 
painted with argyrol. At 3:05, he 
sneezed on 48th Street between 
5th and Madison. Argyrol, a sil- 
ver compound, seeded the super- 
saturated air. Over 2,000,000 tons 
of soot, dust and water vapor fell 
on the city. — H. L. GOLD

scouts disconcertingly reported

the discovery of intelligent life in 
the Virago System. 

“Thirteen planets,” Captain 
Iversen snarled, wishing there 
were someone on whom he could 
place the blame for this mis- 
chance, “and we spend a full year

here exploring each one of them

of all people. I thought for sure 
all the moons were cinders or I 
would never have sent him out to 
them just to keep him from get- 
ting in my hair.” 

“The boy’s not a bad boy, sir,” 
the first officer said. “Just a

thought incompetent, that’s all — 
which is to be expected if the 
Service will choose its officers on 
the basis of written examinations. 
I’m glad to see him make good.” 

Iversen would have been glad 
to see Harkaway make good, too, 
only such a concept seemed ut- 
terly beyond the bounds of possi- 
bility. From the moment the 
young man had first set foot on 
the S. S. Herringbone, he had 
seemed unable to make anything 
but bad. Even in such a conglom- 
eration of fools under Captain 
Iverson, his idiocy was of out- 
standing quality. 

^T^HE captain, however, had not 
been wholly beyond reproach 
in this instance, as he himself 
knew. Pity he had made such an 
error about the eleventh planet’s 
moons. It was really such a small 
mistake. Moons one to eighteen 
and twenty to forty-six still ap- 
peared to be cinders. It was all 
too easy for the spectroscope to 
overlook Flimbot, the nineteenth. 

But it would be Flimbot which 
had turned out to be a green and 
pleasant planet, very similar to 
Earth. Or so Harkaway reported 
on the intercom. 

“And the other forty-five aren’t 
really moons at all,” he began. 
“They’re — ■” 

“You can tell me all that when 
we reach Flimbot,” Iversen inter- 
rupted, “which should be in about 

118 



six hours. Remember, that inter- 
com uses a lot of power and 
we’re tight on fuel.” 

But it proved to be more than 
six days later before the ship 
reached Flimbot. This was owing 
to certain mechanical difficulties 
that arose when the crew tried to 
lift the mother ship from the third 
planet, on which it was based. For 
sentimental reasons, the IEE(E) 
always tried to establish its prime 
base on the third planet of a sys- 
tem. Anyhow, when the Herring- 
bone was on the point of takeoff, 
it was discovered that the rock- 
eating species which was the only 
life on the third planet had eaten 
all the projecting metal parts on 
the ship, including the rocket-ex- 
haust tubes, the airlock handles 
and the chromium trim. 

“I had been wondering what 
made the little fellows so sick,” 
Smullyan, the ship’s doctor, said. 
“They went wump, wump, wump 
all night long, until my heart bled 
for them. Ah, everywhere it goes, 
humanity spreads the fell seeds of 
death and destruction — ” 

“Are you a doctor or a veteri- 
narian?” Iversen demanded furi- 
ously. “By Betelgeuse, you act as 
if I’d crammed those blasted 
tubes down their stinking little 
throats!” 

“It was you who invaded their 
paradise with your ship. It was 
you — ” 

“Shut up!” Iversen yelled. “Shut 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




up, shut up, shut up, shut up!” 

So Dr. Smullyan went off, like 
many a ship’s physician before 
him, and got good and drunk on 
the medical stores. 

"D Y THE time they finally ar- 
rived on Flimbot, Harkaway 
had already gone native. He ap- 
peared at the airlock wearing 
nothing but a brief, colorful loin- 
cloth of alien fabric and a wreath 
of flowers in his hair. He was 
fondling a large, woolly pink cat- 
erpillar. 

“Where is your uniform, sir!” 
Captain Iversen barked, aghast. If 
there was one thing he was intol- 
erant of in his command, it was 
sloppiness. 

“This is the undress uniform of 
the Royal Flimbotzi Navy, sir. I 
was given the privilege of wear- 
ing one as a great mstfgri — 
honor — to our race. If I were to 
return to my own uniform, it 
might set back diplomatic rela- 
tions between Flimbot and Earth 
as much as — •” 

“All right!” the captain snapped. 
“All right, all right, all right!” 

He didn’t ask any questions 
about the Royal Flimbotzi Navy. 
He had deduced its nature when, 
on nearing Flimbot, he had dis- 
covered that the eleventh planet 
actually had only one moon. The 
other forty-five celestial objects 
were spacecraft, quaint and primi- 
tive, it was true, but spacecraft 



nonetheless. Probably it was their 
orbital formation that had made 
him think they were moons. Oh, 
the crew must be in great spirits; 
they did so enjoy having a good 
laugh at his expense! 

He looked for something with 
which to reproach Harkaway, and 
his eye lighted on the caterpillar. 
“What’s that thing you’re carry- 
ing there?” he barked. 

Raising itself on its tail, the 
caterpillar barked right back at 
him. 

Captain Iversen paled. First 
he had overlooked the spacecraft, 
and now, after thirty years of 
faithful service to the IEE(E) in 
the less desirable sectors of space, 
he had committed the ultimate 
error in his first contact with a 
new form of intelligent life! 

“Sorry, sir,” he said, forgetting 
that the creature — whatever its 
mental prowess — could hardly 
be expected to understand Terran 
yet. “I am just a simple space- 
man and my ways are crude, but 
I mean no harm.” He whirled on 
Harkaway. “I thought you said 
the natives were humanoid.” 

The young officer grinned. 
“They are. This is just a greech. 
Cuddly little fellow, isn’t he?” 
The greech licked Harkaway’s 
face with a tripartite blue tongue. 
“The Flimbotzik are mad about 
pets. Great animal-lovers. That’s 
how I knew I could trust them 
right from the start. Show me a

life-form that loves animals, I al- 
ways say, and — ” 

“I’m not interested in what you 
always say,” Iversen interrupted, 
knowing Harkaway’s premise was 
fundamentally unsound, because 
he himself was the kindliest of all 
men, and he hated animals. And, 
although he didn’t hate Hark- 
away, who was not an animal, 
save in the strictly Darwinian 
sense, he could not repress un- 
sportsmanlike feelings of bitter- 
ness, 

W/HY couldn’t it have been 
** one of the other officers who 
had discovered the Flimbotzik? 
Why must it be Harkaway — the 
most inept of his scouts, whose 
only talent seemed to be the egre- 
gious error, who always rushed 
into a thing half-cocked, who mis- 
took superficialities for profundi- 
ties, Harkaway, the blundering 
fool, the blithering idiot — who 
had stumbled into this greatest 
discovery of Iversen’s career? 
And, of course, Harkaway’s, too. 
Well, life was like that and al- 
ways had been. 

“Have you tested those air and 
soil samples yet?” Iversen snarled 
into his communicator, for his 
spacesuit was beginning to itch 
again as the gentle warmth of 
Flimbot activated certain small 
and opportunistic life-forms which 
had emigrated from a previous 
system along with the Terrans.

“We’re running them through 
as fast as we can, sir,” said a har- 
ried voice. “We can offer you no 
more than our poor best” 

“But why bother with all that?” 
Harkaway wanted to know. “This 
planet is absolutely safe for hu- 
man life. I can guarantee it per- 
sonally.” 

“On what basis?” Iversen asked. 
“Well, I’ve been here two weeks 
and I’ve survived, haven’t I?” 
“That,” Iversen told him, “does 
not prove that the planet can sus- 
tain human life.” 

Harkaway laughed richly. 
“Wonderful how you can still 
keep that marvelous sense of hu- 
mor, Skipper, after all the things 
that have been going wrong on 
the voyage. Ah, here comes the 
flim’tuu — the welcoming com- 
mittee,” he said quickly. “They 
were a little shy before. Because 
of the rockets, you know.” 

“Don’t their ships have any?” 
“They don’t seem to. They’re 
really very primitive affairs, 
barely able to go from planet to 
planet.” 

“If they go” Iversen said, 
“stands to reason something must 
power them.” 

“I really don’t know what it is,” 
Harkaway retorted defensively. 
“After all, even though I’ve been 
busy as a beaver, three weeks 
would hardly give me time to in- 
vestigate every aspect of their 
culture. Don’t you think the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




natives are remarkably human- 
oid?” he changed the subject. 

They were, indeed. Except for 
a somewhat greenish cast of coun- 
tenance and' distinctly purple 
hair, as they approached, in their 
brief, gay garments and flower 
garlands, the natives resembled 
nothing so much as a group of 
idealized South Sea Islanders of 
the nineteenth century. 

Gigantic butterflies whizzed 
about their heads. Countless small 
animals frisked about their feet 
— more of the pink caterpillars; 
bright blue creatures that were a 
winsome combination of monkey 
and koala; a kind of large, merry- 
eyed snake that moved by hold- 
ing its tail in its mouth and roll- 
ing like a hoop. All had faces that 
reminded the captain of the work 
of the celebrated twentieth-cen- 
tury artist W. Disney. 

^D Y POLARIS,” he cried in 
disgust, “I might have 
known you’d find a cute planet!” 
“Moon, actually,” the first- offi- 
cer said, “since it is in orbit 
around Virago XI, rather than 
Virago itself.” 

“Would you have wanted them 
to be hostile?” Harkaway asked 
peevishly. “Honestly, some peo- 
ple never seem to be satisfied.” 
From his proprietary airs, one 
would think Harkaway had cre- 
ated the natives himself. “At least, 
with hostile races, you know 



where you are,” Iversen said. “I 
always suspect friendly life-forms. 
Friendliness simply isn’t a natural 
instinct.” 

“Who’s being anthropomorphic 
now!” Harkaway chided. 

Iversen flushed, for he had be- 
rated the young man for that par- 
ticular fault on more than one oc- 
casion. Harkaway was too prone 
to interpret alien traits in terms 
of terrestrial culture. Previously, 
since all intelligent life-forms 
with which the Herringbone had 
come into contact had already 
been discovered by somebody 
else, that didn’t matter too much. 
In this instance, however, any 
mistakes of contact or interpreta- 
tion mattered terribly. And Iver- 
sen couldn’t see Harkaway not 
making a mistake; the boy simply 
didn’t have it in him. 

“You know you’re superimpos- 
ing our attitude on theirs,” the 
junior officer continued tactlessly. 
“The Flimbotzik are a simple, 
friendly, shig-livi people, closely 
resembling some of our historical 
primitives — in a nice way, of 
course.” 

“None of our primitives had 
space travel,” Iversen pointed out. 

“Well, you couldn’t really call 
those things spaceships,” Harka- 
way said deprecatingly. 

“They go through space, don’t 
they? I don’t know what else 
you’d call them.” 

“One judges the primitiveness 



ONCE A GREECH 



121 




of a race by its cultural and tech- 
nological institutions,” Harkaway 
said, with a lofty smile. “And 
these people are laughably back- 
ward. Why, they even believe in 
reincarnation — mpoola, they call 
it.” 

“How do you know all this?” 
Iversen demanded. “Don’t tell me 
you profess to speak, the lan- 
guage already?” 

“It’s not a difficult language,” 
Harkaway said modestly, “and I 
have managed to pick up quite a 
comprehensive smattering. I dare- 
say I haven’t caught all the nu- 
ances — heeka lob peeka, as the 
Flimbotzik themselves say — but 
they are a very simple people and 
probably they don’t have — ” 

“Are we going to keep them 
waiting,” Iversen asked, “while we 
discuss nuances? Since you say 
you speak the language so well, 
suppose you make them a pretty 
speech all about how the Earth 
government extends the — I sup- 
pose it would be hand, in this in- 
stance — of friendship to Flimbot 
and — ” 

Harkaway blushed. “I sort of 
did that already, acting as your 
deputy. Mpoo — status — means 
so much in these simple societies, 
you know, and they seemed to ex- 
pect something of the sort. How- 
ever, I’ll introduce you to the 
Flimflim— the king, you know—” 
he pointed to an imposing indi- 
vidual in the forefront of the 

122 



crowd — “and get over all the 
amenities, shall I?” 

“It would be jolly good of you,” 
Iversen said frigidly. 

T T WAS a pity they hadn’t dis- 
covered Flimbot much earlier 
in their survey of the Virago Sys- 
tem, Iversen thought with regret, 
because it was truly a pleasant 
spot and a week was very little 
time in which to explore a world 
and study a race, even one as sim- 
ple as the gentle Flimbotzik actu- 
ally turned out to be. It seemed 
amazing that they should have 
developed anything as advanced 
as space travel, when their only 
ground conveyances were a spe- 
cies of wagon drawn by plookik, 
a species of animal. 

But Iversen had no time for 
further investigation. The Her- 
ringbone’s fuel supply was calcu- 
lated almost to the minute and so, 
willy-nilly, the Earthmen had to 
leave beautiful Flimbot at the 
end of the week, knowing little 
more about the Flimbotzik than 
they had before they came. Only 
Harkaway, who had spent the 
three previous weeks on Flimbot, 
had any further knowledge of the 
Flimbotzik — and Iversen had 
little faith in any data he might 
have collected. 

“I don’t believe Harkaway 
knows the language nearly as well 
as he pretends to,” Iversen told 
the first officer as both of them 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




watched the young lieutenant 
make the formal speech of fare- 
well. 

“Come now,” the first officer 
protested. “Seems to me the boy 
is doing quite well. Acquired a 
remarkable command of the lan- 
guage, considering he’s been here 
only four weeks.” 

“Remarkable, I’ll grant you, but 
is it accurate?” 

“He seems to communicate and 
that is the ultimate objective of 
language, is it not?” 

“Then why did the Flimbotzik 
fill the tanks with wine when I 
distinctly told him to ask for 
water?” 

Of course the ship could syn- 
thesize water from its own waste 
products, if necessary, but there 
was no point in resorting to that 
expedient when a plentiful sup- 
ply of pure H.O was available on 
the world. 

“A very understandable error, 
sir. Harkaway explained it to me. 
It seems the word for water, 
m’koog, is very similar to the 
word for wine, mWoog. Harkaway 
himself admits his pronunciation 
isn’t perfect and — ” 

“All right,” Iversen interrupted. 
“What I’d like to know is what 
happened to the mk’oog, then — •” 

“The rrikoog, you mean? It’s in 
the tanks.” 

“ — because, when they came_to 
drain the wine out of the tanks 
to put the water in, the tanks 



were already totally empty.” 
“I have no idea,” the first offi- 
cer said frostily, “no idea at all. If 
you’ll glance at my papers, you’ll 
note I’m Temperance by affilia- 
tion, but if you’d like to search 
my cabin, anyway, I — •” 

“By Miaplacidus, man,” Iver- 
sen exclaimed, “I wasn’t accusing 
you! Of that, anyway!” 

Everybody on the vessel was 
so confoundedly touchy. Lucky 
they had a stable commanding 
officer like himself, or morale 
would simply go to pot. 

^ ELL, it’s all over,” Hark- 
” away said, joining them up 
at the airlock in one lithe bound 
— a mean feat in that light grav- 
ity. “And a right good speech, if 
I do say so myself. The Flimflim 
says he will count the thlubbzik 
with ardent expectation until the 
mission from Earth arrives with 
the promised gifts.” 

“Just what gifts did you take it 
upon yourself to — ” Iversen be- 
gan, when he was interrupted by 
a voice behind them crying, “Woe, 
woe, woe!” 

And, thrusting himself past the 
three other officers, Dr. Smullyan 
addressed the flim’puu, or fare- 
well committee, assembled out- 
side the ship. “Do not let the 
Earthmen return to your fair 
planet, O happily ignorant Flim- 
botzik,” he declaimed, “lest 
wretchedness and misery be your

123 




lot as a result Tell them, ‘Hence!’ 
Tell them, ‘Begone!’ Tell them, 
‘Avaunt!’ For, know ye, human- 
ity is a blight, a creeping can- 
ker — ” 

He was interrupted by the cap- 
tain’s broad palm clamping down 
over his mouth. 

“Clap him in the brig, some- 
body, until we get clear of this 
place,” Iversen ordered wearily. 
“If Harkaway could pick up the 
Flimbotzi language, the odds are 
that some of the natives have 
picked up Terran.” 

‘That’s right, always keep be- 
littling me,” Harkaway said sulk- 
ily as two of the crewmen carried 
off the struggling medical officer, 
who left an aromatic wake behind 
him that bore pungent testimonial 
to where a part, at least, of the 
mk’oog had gone. “No wonder it 
took me so long to find myself.” 

“Oh, have you found yourself 
at last?” Iversen purred. “Splen- 
did! Now that you know where 
you are, supposing you do me a 
big favor and go lose yourself 
again while we make ready for 
blastoff” 

“For shame,” said the first offi- 
cer as Harkaway stamped off. 
“For shame!” 

‘The captain’s a hard man,” ob- 
served the chief petty officer, who 
was lounging negligently against 
a wall, doing nothing. 

“Ay, that he is,” agreed the 
crewman who was assisting him. 



“That he is — a hard man, in- 
deed.” 

“By Caroli, be quiet, all of 
you!” Iversen yelled. The very 
next voyage, he was going to have 
a new crew if he had to transfer 
to Colonization to do it! Even 
colonists couldn’t be as obnoxious 
as the sons of space with which 
he was cursed. 

T T WAS only after the Herring- 
bone had left the Virago Sys- 
tem entirely that Iversen discov- 
ered Harkaway had taken the 
greech along. 

“But you can’t abscond with 
one of the natives’ pets!” he pro- 
tested, overlooking, for the sake 
of rhetoric, the undeniable fact 
that Harkaway had already done 
so and that there could be no 
turning back. It would expend too 
much precious fuel and leave 
them stranded for life on Virago 
XI a . 

“Nonsense, sir!” Harkaway re- 
torted. “Didn’t the Flimflim say 
everything on Flimbot was mine? 
Thlrfpt shig-nliv, snusnigg bnig- 
nliv were his very words. Anyhow, 
they have plenty more greechl 
They won’t miss this little one.” 

“But he may have belonged to 
someone,” Iversen objected. “An 
incident like this could start a 
war.” 

“I don’t see how he could have 
belonged to anyone. Followed me 
around most of the time I was 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




there. We’ve become great pals, 
haven’t we, little fellow?” He ruf- 
fled the greech’s pink fur and the 
creature gave a delighted squeal. 

Iversen could already see that 
the greechik were going to be Flim- 
bot’s first lucrative export. From 
time immemorial, the people of 
Earth had been susceptible to 
cuddly little life-forms, which was 
why Earth had nearly been con- 
quered by the zz ,u from Sirius 
VII, before they discovered them 
to be hostile and quite intelligent 
life-forms rather than a new spe- 
cies of tabby. 

“Couldn’t bear to leave him,” 
Harkaway went on as the greech 
draped itself around his shoulders 
and regarded Iversen with large 
round blue eyes. “The Flimflim 
won’t mind, because I promised 
him an elephant.” 

“You mean the diplomatic mis- 
sion will have to waste valuable 
cargo space on an elephant !” 
Iversen sputtered. “And you 
should know, if anyone does, just 
how spacesick an elephant can 
get. By Pherkad, Lieutenant 
Harkaway, you had no authority 
to make any promises to the 
Flimflim!” 

“I discovered the Flimbotzik,” 
Harkaway said sullenly. “I learned 
the language. I established rap- 
port. Just because you happen to 
be the commander of this expe- 
dition doesn’t mean you’re God, 
Captain Iversen!” 



“Harkaway,” the captain 
barked, “this smacks of downright 
mutiny! Go to your cabin forth- 
with and memorize six verses of 
the Spaceman’s Credo!” 

nr HE greech lifted its head and 
■*- barked back at Iversen, again. 
“That’s my brave little watch- 
greech,” Harkaway said fondly. 
“As a matter of fact, sir,” he told 
the captain, “that was just what I 
was proposing to do myself. Go to 
my cabin, I mean; I have no time 
to waste on inferior prose. I plan 
to spend the rest of the voyage, or 
such part as I can spare from my 
duties — ” 

“You’re relieved of them,” Iver- 
sen said grimly. 

“ — working on my book. It’s 
all about the doctrine of mpoola 
— reincarnation, or, if you prefer, 
metempsychosis. The Flimbotzi 
religion is so similar to many of 
the earlier terrestrial theologies 
— Hindu, Greek, Egyptian, South- 
ern Californian — that sometimes 
one is almost tempted to stop and 
wonder if simplicity is not the es- 
sence of truth.” 

Iversen knew that, for the sake 
of discipline, he should not, once 
he had ordered Harkaway to his 
cabin, stop to bandy words, but he 
was a chronic word-bandier, hav- 
ing inherited the trait from his 
stalwart Viking ancestors. “How 
can you have learned all about 
their religion, their doctrine of re- 



ONCE A GREECH 



125 




incarnation, in just four ridicu- 
lously short weeks?” 

“It’s a gift,” Harkaway said 
modestly. 

“Go to your cabin, sir! No, wait 
a moment!” For, suddenly over- 
come by a strange, warm, utterly 
repulsive emotion, Iversen pointed 
a quivering finger at the caterpil- 
lar. “Did you bring along the 
proper food for that — that thing? 
Can’t have him starving, you 
know,” he added gruffly. After all, 
he was a humane man, he told 
himself; it wasn’t that he found 
the creature tugging at his heart- 
strings, or anything like that. 

“Oh, he’ll eat anything we eat, 
sir. As long as it’s not meat. All 
the species on Flimbot are herbi- 
vores. I can’t figure out whether 
the Flimbotzik themselves are 
vegetarians because they practice 
mpoola, or practice mpoola be- 
cause they’re — ■” 

“I don’t want to hear another 
word about mpoola or about 
Flimbot!” Iversen yelled. “Get out 
of here! And stay away from the 
library!” 

“I have already exhausted its 
painfully limited resources, sir.” 
Harkaway saluted with grace and 
withdrew to his cabin, wearing the 
greech like an affectionate lei 
about his neck. 

¥ VERSEN heard no more about 
mpoola from Harkaway — 
who, though he did not remain 



confined to his cabin when he had 
pursuits to pursue in other parts 
of the ship, at least had the tact 
to keep out of the captain’s way 
as much as possible — but the 
rest of his men seemed able to 
talk of nothing else. The voyage 
back from a star system was al- 
ways longer in relative terms than 
the voyage out, because the thrill 
of new worlds to explore was 
gone; already anticipating bore- 
dom, the men were ripe for al- 
most any distraction. 

On one return voyage, the 
whole crew had set itself to the 
study of Hittite with very credita- 
ble results. On another, they had 
all devoted themselves to the an- 
cient art of alchemy, and, after 
nearly blowing up the ship, had 
come up with an elixir which, al- 
though not the quintessence — as 
they had, in their initial enthusi- 
asm, alleged — proved to be an 
effective cure for hiccups. Pat- 
ented under the name of Herring- 
bone Hiccup Shoo, it brought 
each one of them an income 
which would have been enough 
to support them in more than 
modest comfort for the rest of 
their lives. 

However, the adventurous life 
seemed to exert an irresistible 
lure upon them and they all 
shipped upon the Herringbone 
again — much to the captain’s 
dismay, for he had hoped for a 
fresh start with a new crew and 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




there seemed to be no way of get- 
ting rid of them short of reaching 
retirement age. 

The men weren’t quite ready to 
accept mpoola as a practical reli- 
gion — Harkaway hadn’t finished 
his book yet — but as something 
very close to it. The concept of 
reincarnation had always been 
very appealing to the human 
mind, which would rather have 
envisaged itself perpetuated in 
the body of a cockroach than 
vanishing completely into noth- 
ingness. 

“It’s all so logical, sir,” the first 
officer told Iversen. “The individ- 
uality or the soul or the psyche — 
however you want to look at it — 
starts the essentially simple cycle 
of life as a greech—” 

“Why as a greech?” Iversen 
asked, humoring him for the mo- 
ment. “There are lower life-forms 
on Flimbot.” 

“I don’t know.” The first officer 
sounded almost testy. “That’s 
where Harkaway starts the pro- 
gression.” 

“Harkaway! Is there no escap- 
ing that cretin’s name?” 

“Sir,” said the first officer, “may 
I speak frankly?” 

“No,” Iversen said, “you may 
not.” 

“Your skepticism arises less 
from disbelief than from the fact 
that you are jealous of Harkaway 
because it was he who made the 
great discovery, not you.” 



fCV^HICH great discovery?” 
” Iversen asked, sneering to 
conceal his hurt at being so over- 
whelmingly misunderstood. “Flim- 
bot or mpoola?” 

“Both,” the first officer said. 
“You refuse to accept the fact 
that this hitherto incompetent 
youth has at last blossomed forth 
in the lambent colors of genius, 
just as the worthy greech becomes 
a zkoort, and the clean-living 
zkoort in his turn passes on to the 
next higher plane of existence, 
which is, in the Flimbotzik 
scale — ” 

“Spare me the theology, please,” 
Iversen begged. “Once a greech, 
always a greech, I say. And I 
can’t help thinking that somehow, 
somewhere, Harkaway has com- 
mitted some horrible error.” 
“Humanity is frail, fumbling, 
futile,” Dr. Smullyan declared, 
coming upon them so suddenly 
that both officers jumped. “To 
err is human, to forgive divine, 
and I am an atheist, thank God!” 
“That mk’oog is powerful stuff,” 
the first officer said. “Or so they 
tell me,” he added. 

“This is more than mere 
mk’oog Iversen said sourly. 
“Smullyan has been too long in 
space. It hits everyone in the long 
run — some sooner than others.” 
“Captain,” the doctor said, ig- 
noring these remarks as he ig- 
nored everything not on a cosmic 
level, which included the crew’s 



ONCE A GREECH 



127 




ailments, “I am in full agreement 
with you. Young Harkaway has 
doomed that pretty little 
planet — ” 

“Moon,” the first officer cor- 
rected. “It’s a satellite, not a — ” 

“We ourselves were doomed ab 
origine, but the tragic flaw inher- 
ent in each one of our pitiful spe- 
cies is contagious, dooming all 
with whom we come in contact. 
And Harkaway is the most infec- 
tious carrier on the ship. Woe, I 
tell you. Woe!” And, with a hol- 
low moan, the doctor left them to 
meditate upon the state of their 
souls, while he went off to his 
secret stores of oblivion. 

“Wonder where he’s hidden that 
mk’oog,” Iversen brooded. “I’ve 
turned the ship inside out and I 
haven’t been able to locate it.” 

The first officer shivered. 
“Somehow, although I know 
Smullyan’s part drunk, part mad, 
he makes me a little nervous. 
He’s been right so often on all the 
other voyages.” 

“Ruchbah!” Iversen said, not 
particularly grateful for support 
from such a dithyrambic source 
as the ship’s medical officer. 
“Anyone who prophesies doom 
has a hundred per cent chance of 
ultimately being right, if only be- 
cause of entropy.” 

He was still brooding over the 
first officer’s thrust, even though 
he had been well aware that most 
of his officers and men considered 

128 



him a sorehead for doubting 
Harkaway in the young man’s 
moment of triumph. However, 
Iversen could not believe that 
Harkaway had undergone such a 
radical transformation. Even on 
the basis of mpoola, one obvi- 
ously had to die before passing 
on to the next existence and 
Harkaway had been continuously 
alive — from the neck down, at 
least. 

Furthermore, all that aside, 
Iversen just couldn’t see Harka- 
way going on to a higher plane. 
Although he supposed the young 
man was well-meaning enough — 
he’d grant him that negligible vir- 
tue — wouldn’t it be terrible to 
have a system of existence in 
which one was advanced on the 
basis of intent rather than result? 
The higher life-forms would de- 
generate into primitivism. 

But weren’t the Flimbotzik vir- 
tually primitive? Or so Harkaway 
had said, for Iversen himself had 
not had enough contact with 
them to determine their degree of 
sophistication, and only the space- 
ships gave Harkaway’s claim the 
lie. 

¥ VERSEN condescended to take 
a look at the opening chapter 
of Harkaway’s book, just to see 
what the whole thing was about. 
The book began: 

“What is the difference between 
life and death? Can we say defi- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




nitely and definitively that life is 
life and death is death? Are we 
sure that death is not life and life 
is not death? 

“No, we are not sure! 

“Must the individuality have a 
corporeal essence in which to en- 
shroud itself before it can proceed 
in its rapt, inexorable progress to- 
ward the Ultimate Non-actuality? 
And even if such be needful, why 
must the personal essence be 
trammeled by the same old worn- 
out habiliments of error? 

“Think upon this! 

“Wha\ is the extremest intensi- 
fication of individuality? It is the 
All-encompassing Nothingness. Of 
what value are the fur, the feath- 
ers, the skin, the temporal trap- 
pings of imperfection in our per- 
petual struggle toward the final 
undefinable resolution into the In- 
finite Interplay of Cosmic Forces? 

“Less than nothing!” 

At this point, Iversen stopped 
reading and returned the manu- 
script to its creator, without a 
word. This last was less out of 
self-restraint than through sheer 
semantic inadequacy. 

The young man might have 
spent his time more profitably in 
a little research on the biology or 
social organization of the Flim- 
botzik, Iversen thought bitterly 
when he had calmed down, thus 
saving the next expedition some 
work. But, instead, he’d been 
blinded by the flashy theological 



aspects of the culture and, as a 
result, the whole crew had gone 
metempsychotic. 

This was going to be one of the 
Herringbone’s more unendurable 
voyages, Iversen knew. And he 
couldn’t put his foot down effec- 
tively, either, because the crew, 
all being gentlemen of indepen- 
dent means now, were outra- 
geously independent. 

However, in spite of knowing 
that all of them fully deserved 
what they got, Iversen couldn’t 
help feeling guilty as he ate steak 
while the other officers consumed 
fish, vegetables and eggs in an 
aura of unbearable virtue. 

“But if the soul transmigrates 
and not the body,” he argued, 
“what harm is there in consuming 
the vacated receptacle?” 

“For all you know,” the first 
officer said, averting his eyes from 
Iversen’s plate with a little — 
wholly gratuitous, to the captain’s 
mind — shudder,, “that cow might 
have housed the psyche of your 
grandmother.” 

“Well, then, by indirectly partic- 
ipating in that animal’s slaughter, 
I have released my grand- 
mother from her physical bond- 
age to advance to the next plane. 
That is, if she was a good cow.” 
“You just don’t understand,” 
Harkaway said. “Not that you 
could be expected to.” 

“He’s a clod,” the radio opera- 
tor agreed. “Forgive me, sir,” he 



ONCE A OREECH 



129 




apologized as Iversen turned to 
glare incredulously at him, “but, 
according to mpoola, candor is a 
Step Upward” 

“Onward and Upward,” Hark- 
away commented, and Iversen 
was almost sure that, had he not 
been there, the men would have 
bowed their heads in contempla- 
tion, if not actual prayer. 

4 S TIME went on, the greech 
thrived and grew remarkably 
stout on the Earth viands, which 
it consumed in almost improbable 
quantities. Then, one day, it dis- 
appeared and its happy squeal 
was heard no longer. 

There was much mourning 
aboard the Herringbone • — : for, 
with its lovable personality and 
innocently engaging ways, the lit- 
tle fellow had won its way into 
the hearts of all the spacemen — 
until the first officer discovered a 
substantial pink cocoon resting on 
the ship’s control board and 
rushed to the intercom to spread 
the glad tidings. That was a 
breach of regulations, of course, 
but Iversen knew when not to 
crowd his fragile authority. 

“I should have known there 
was some material basis for the 
spiritual doctrine of mpoola,” 
Harkaway declared with tears in 
his eyes as he regarded the dor- 
mant form of his little pet. “Was 
it not the transformation of the 
caterpillar into the butterfly that 

ISO 



first showed us on Earth how the 
soul might emerge winged and 
beautiful from its vile house of 
clay? Gentlemen,” he said, in a 
voice choked with emotion, “our 
little greech is about to become a 
zkoort. Praised be the Impersonal 
Being who has allowed such a 
miracle to take place before our 
very eyes. J’goona lo mpoona.” 
“Amen,” said the first officer 
reverently. 

All those in the control room 
bowed their heads except Iversen. 
And even he didn’t quite have the 
nerve to tell them that the cocoon 
was pushing the Herringbone two 
points off course. 

AKE that thing away be- 
fore I lose my temper and 
clobber it,” Iversen said impa- 
tiently as the zkoort dived low to 
buzz him, then whizzed just out 
of its reach on its huge, brilliant 
wings, giggling raucously. 

“He was just having his bit of 
fun,” the first officer said with re- 
proach. “Have you no tolerance, 
Captain, no appreciation of the 
joys of golden youth?” 

“A spaceship is no place for a 
butterfly,” Iversen said, “espe- 
cially a four-foot butterfly.” 

“How can you say that?” Hark- 
away retorted. “The Herringbone 
is the only spaceship that ever 
had one, to my knowledge. And I 
think I can safely say our lives 
are all a bit brighter and better 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and m'poo’p for having a zkoort 
among us. Thanks be to the Di- 
vine Nonentity for — ” 

“Poor little butterfly,” Dr. 
Smullyan declared sonorously, 
“living out his brief life span so 
far from the fresh air, the sun- 
shine, the pretty flowers — ” 

“Oh, I don’t know that it’s as 
bad as all that,” the first officer 
said. “He hangs around hydro- 
ponics a lot and he gets a daily 
ration of vitamins.” Then he 
paled. “But that’s right — a but- 
terfly does live only a day, doesn’t 
it?” 

“It’s different with a zkoort,” 
Harkaway maintained stoutly, 
though he also, Iversen noted, lost 
his ruddy color. “After all, he isn’t 
really a butterfly, merely an anal- 
ogous life-form.” 

“My, my! In four weeks, you’ve 
mastered their entomology as well 
as their theology and language,” 
Iversen jeered. “Is there no end 
to your accomplishments, Lieu- 
tenant?” 

Harkaway’s color came back 
twofold. “He’s already been 
around half a thubb,” he pointed 
out. “Over two weeks.” 

“Well, the thing is bigger than 
a Terrestrial butterfly,” Iversen 
conceded, “so you have to make 
some allowances for size. On the 
other hand — ” 

Laughing madly, the zkoort 
swooped down on him. Iversen 
beat it away with a snarl. 



“Playful little fellow, isn’t he?” 
the first officer said, with thor- 
oughly annoying fondness. 

“He likes you, Skipper,” Harka- 
way explained. “Urg’h n gurg’h — 
or, to give it the crude Terran 
equivalent, living is loving. He 
can tell that beneath that grizzled 
and seemingly harsh exterior of 
yours, Captain—” 

But, with a scream of rage, 
Iversen had locked himself into 
his cabin. Outside, he could hear 
the zkoort beating its wings 
against the door and wailing dis- 
appointedly. 

S OME days later, a pair of rap- 
idly dulling wings were found 
on the floor of the hydroponics 
chamber. But of the zkoort’s lit- 
tle body, there was no sign. An air 
of gloom and despondency hung 
over the Herringbone and even 
Iversen felt a pang, though he 
would never admit it without 
brainwashing. 

During the next week, the men, 
seeking to forget their loss, 
plunged themselves into mpoola 
with real fanaticism. Harkaway 
took to wearing some sort of ec- 
clesiastical robes which he 
whipped up out of the recreation 
room curtains. Iversen had nei- 
ther the heart nor the courage to 
stop him, though this, too, was 
against regulations. Everyone ex- 
cept Iversen gave up eating fish 
and eggs in addition to meat.

Then, suddenly, one day a roly- 
poly blue animal appeared at the 
officers mess, claiming everyone 
as an old friend with loud squeals 
of joy. This time, Iversen was the 
only one who was glad to see him 
— really glad. 



“Of course, it does kind of 
knock your theory of the trans- 
migration of souls into a cocked 
hat,” the captain grinned. “Be- 
cause, in order for the soul to 
transmigrate, the previous body’s 
got to be dead, and I’m afraid our

asked, scratching the delighted “Looks it, doesn’t it?” muttered 
animal between the ears. Harkaway. 

“Why, sure,” Harkaway said, “I rather think,” Iversen went 
putting his fork down and leaving on, tickling the creature under 
his vegetable macedoine virtually the chin until it squealed happily, 
untasted. “Sure. I’m very hap- “that you didn’t quite get the nu- 
py — ■” his voice broke — “very ances of the language, did you,

A T THIS point, the radio oper- 
ator almost sobbingly asked 
to be excused from the table. Fol- 
lowing his departure, there was a 
long silence. It was hard, Iversen 
realized in a burst of uncharacter- 
istic tolerance, to have one’s be- 



that the whole difficulty was a se- 
mantic one. The Flimbotzik were 
explaining the zoology of the na- 
tive life-forms to you and you 
misunderstood it as their the- 
ology.” 

“Looks it, doesn’t it?” Harka- 



way repeated glumly. “It cer- 
tainly looks it.” 

“Cheer up,” Iversen said, reach- 
ing over to slap the young man 
on the back — a bit to his own 
amazement. “No real harm done. 
What if the Flimbotzik are less 
primitive than you fancied? It 
makes our discovery the more 
worthwhile, doesn’t it?” 



lief, even so newly born a credo, 
annihilated with such sudden- 
ness. 

“After all, you did run across 
the Flimbotzik first,” he told 
Harkaway as he spread goose- 
berry jam on a hard roll for the 
ravenous ex-zkoort (now a chu- 
wugg, he had been told). “That’s 
the main thing, and a life-form

that passes through two such 
striking metamorphoses is not un- 
fraught with interest. You shall 
receive full credit, my boy, and 
your little mistake doesn’t mean 
a thing except — ” 

“Doom,” said Dr. Smullyan, 
sopping up the last of his gravy 
with a piece of bread. “Doom, 
doom, doom.” He stuffed the 
bread into his mouth. 

“Look, Smullyan,” Iversen told 
him jovially, “you better watch 
out. If you keep talking that way, 
next voyage out we’ll sign on a 
parrot instead of a medical officer. 
Cheaper and just as efficient.” 
Only the chu-wugg joined in his 
laughter. 

“Ever since I can remember,” 
the first officer said, looking 
gloomily at the doctor, “he’s never 
been wrong. Maybe he has pow- 
ers beyond our comprehension. 
Perhaps we sought at the end of 
the Galaxy what was in our own 
back yard all the time.” 

“Who was seeking what?” Iver- 
sen asked as all the officers looked 
at Smullyan with respectful awe. 
“I demand an answer!” 

But the only one who spoke 
was the doctor. “Only Man is 
vile,” he said, as if to himself, and 
fell asleep with his head on the 
table. 

“Make a cult out of Smullyan,” 
Iversen warned the others, “and 
I’ll scuttle the ship!” 

Later on, the first officer got the 

134 



captain alone. “Look here, sir,” he 
began tensely, “have you read 
Harkaway’s book about mpoola?” 

“I read part of the first chap- 
ter,” Iversen told him, “and that 
was enough. Maybe to Harka- 
way it’s eschatology, but to me 
it’s just plain scatology!” 

“But — ■” 

“Why in Zubeneschamali,” 
Iversen said patiently, “should I 
waste my time reading a book de- 
voted to a theory which has al- 
ready been proved erroneous? 
Answer me that!” 

“I think you should have a look 
at the whole thing,” the first offi- 
cer persisted. 

“Baham!” Iversen replied, but 
amiably enough, for he was in 
rare good humor these days. And 
he needed good humor to tolerate 
the way his officers and men were 
behaving. All right, they had 
made idiots of themselves; that 
was understandable, expected, fa- 
miliar. But it wasn’t the chu- 
wugg’s fault. Iversen had never 
seen such a bunch of soreheads. 
Why did they have to take their 
embarrassment and humiliation 
out on an innocent little animal? 

For, although no one actually 
mistreated the chu-wugg, the men 
avoided him as much as possible. 
Often Iversen would come upon 
the little fellow weeping from 
loneliness in a comer with no one 
to play with and, giving in to his 
own human weakness, the captain 

6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




would dry the creature’s tears 
and comfort him. In return, the 
chu-wugg would laugh at all his 
jokes, for he seemed to have ac- 
quired an elementary knowledge 
of Terran. 

C?T>Y Vindemiatrix, Lieuten- 

-■-* ant,” the captain roared as 
Harkaway, foiled in his attempt 
to scurry off unobserved, stood 
quivering before him, “why have 
you been avoiding me like this?” 

“I didn’t think I was avoiding 
you any particular way, sir,” 
Harkaway said. “I mean does it 
appear like that, sir? It’s only 
that I’ve been busy with my du- 
ties, sir.” 

“I don’t know what’s the mat- 
ter with you! I told you I hand- 
somely forgave you for your mis- 
take.” 

“But I can never forgive my- 
self, sir — ” 

“Are you trying to go over my 
head?” Iversen thundered. 

“No, sir. I — ” 

“If I am willing to forgive you, 
you will forgive yourself. That’s 
an order!” 

“Yes, sir,” the young man said 
feebly. 

Harkaway had changed back 
to his uniform, Iversen noted, but 
he looked unkempt, ill, harrowed. 
The boy had really been suffering 
for his precipitance. Perhaps the 
captain himself had been a little 
hard on him. 



Iversen modulated his tone to 
active friendliness. “Thought you 
might like to know the chu-wugg 
turned into a hoop-snake this 
morning!” 

But Harkaway did not seem 
cheered by this social note. “So 
soon!” 

“You knew there would be a 
fourth metamorphosis!” Iversen 
was disappointed. But he realized 
that Harkaway was bound to 
have acquired such fundamental 
data, no matter how he inter- 
preted them. It was possible, Iver- 
sen thought, that the book could 
actually have some value, if there 
were some way of weeding fact 
from fancy, and surely there must 
be scholars trained in such an art, 
for Earth had many wholly indig- 
enous texts of like nature. 

“He’s a thor’glitch now,” Hark- 
away told him dully. 

“And what comes next? . 
No, don’t tell me. It’s more fun 
not knowing beforehand. You 
know,” Iversen went on, almost 
rubbing his hands together, “I 
think this species is going to ex- 
cite more interest on Earth than 
the Flimbotzik themselves. After 
all, people are people, even if 
they’re green, but an animal that 
changes shape so many times and 
so radically is really going to set 
biologists by the ears. What did 
you say the name of the species 
as a whole was?” 

“I — I couldn’t say, sir.” 



ONCE A GREECH 



135 




“Ah,” Iversen remarked wag- 
gishly, “so there are one or two 
things you don’t know about 
Flimbot, eh?” 

Harkaway opened his mouth, 
but only a fault bleating sound 
came out. 

A S THE days went on, Iversen 
found himself growing fonder 
and fonder of the thor’glitch. Fi- 
nally, in spite of the fact that it 
had now attained the dimensions 
of a well-developed boa constric- 
tor, he took it to live in his quar- 
ters. 

Many was the quiet evening 
they spent together, Iversen en- 
tering acid comments upon the 
crew in the ship’s log, while the 
thor’glitch looked over viewtapes 
from the ship’s library. 

The captain was surprised to 
find how much he — well, en- 
joyed this domestic tranquility. I 
must be growing old, he thought 
— old and mellow. And he named 
the creature Bridey, after a twen- 
tieth-century figure who had, he 
believed, been connected with an- 
other metempsychotic furor. 

When the thor’glitch grew list- 
less and began to swell in the 
middle, Iversen got alarmed and 
sent for Dr. Smullyan. 

“Aha!” the medical officer de- 
claimed, with a casual glance at 
the suffering snake. “The day of 
reckoning is at hand! Reap the 
fruit of your transgression, scurvy 

136 



humans! Calamity approaches 
with jets aflame!” 

Iversen clutched the doctor’s 
sleeve. “Is he — is he going to 
die?” 

“Unhand me, presumptuous 
navigator!” Dr. Smullyan shook 
the captain’s fingers off his arm. 
“I didn’t say he was going to die,” 
he offered in ordinary bedside 
tones. “Not being a specialist in 
this particular sector, I am not 
qualified to offer an opinion, but, 
strictly off the record, I would 
hazard the guess that he’s about 
to metamorphose again.” 

“He never did it in public be- 
fore,” Iversen said worriedly. 

“The old order changeth,” 
Smullyan told him. “You’d better 
call Harkaway.” 

“What does he know!” 

“Too little and, at the same 
time, too much,” the doctor de- 
claimed, dissociating himself pro- 
fessionally from the case. “Too 
much and too little. Eat, drink, 
be merry, iniquitous Earthmen, 
for you died yesterday!” 

“Oh, shut up,” Iversen said au- 
tomatically, and dispatched a 
message to Harkaway with the in- 
formation that the thor’glitch ap- 
peared to be metamorphosing 
again and that his presence was 
requested in the captain’s cabin. 

The rest of the officers accom- 
panied Harkaway, all of them 
with the air of attending a fune- 
ral rather than a rebirth, Iversen 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




noted nervously. They weren’t 
armed, though, so Bridey couldn’t 
be turning into anything danger- 
ous. 

1VTOW it came to pass that the 
^ thor’glitch’s mid-section, hav- 
ing swelled to unbearable propor- 
tions, began to quiver. Suddenly, 
the skin split lengthwise and 
dropped cleanly to either side, 
like a banana peel. 

Iversen pressed forward to see 
what fresh life-form the bulging 
cavity had held. The other officers 
all stood in a somber row without 
moving, for all along, Iversen real- 
ized, they had known what to ex- 
pect, what was to come. And they 
had not told him. But then, he 
knew, it was his own fault; he 
had refused to be told. 

Now, looking down at the new 
life-form, he saw for himself what 
it was. Lying languidly in the 
thor’glitch skin was a slender 
youth of a pallor which seemed 
excessive even for a member of a 
green-skinned race. He had large 
limpid eyes and a smile of inef- 
fable sweetness. 

“By Nopus Secundus,” Iversen 
groaned. “I’m sunk.” 

“Naturally the ultimate incar- 
nation for a life-form would be 
humanoid,” Harkaway said with 
deep reproach. “What else?” 

“I’m surprised you didn’t figure 
that out for yourself, sir,” the first 
officer added. “Even, if you did 



refuse to read Harkaway*s book, 
it seems obvious.” 

“Does it?” Smullyan challenged. 
“Does it, indeed? Is Man the 
highest form of life in an irra- 
tional cosmos? Then all causes 
are lost ones! ... So many 
worlds,” he muttered in more sub- 
dued tones, “so much to do, so 
little done, such things to be!” 
“The Flimbotzik were telling 
Harkaway about their own life 
cycle,” Iversen whispered as reve- 
lation bathed him in its murky 
light. “The human embryo under- 
goes a series of changes inside 
the womb. It’s just that the Flim- 
botzik fetus develops outside the 
womb.” 

“Handily bypassing the earliest 
and most unpleasant stages of hu- 
manity,” Smullyan sighed. “Oh, 
idyllic planet, where one need 
never be a child — where one 
need never see a child!” 

“Then they were trying to ex- 
plain their biology to you quite 
clearly and coherently, you lunk- 
head,” Iversen roared at Harka- 
way, “and you took it for a reli- 
gious doctrine!” 

“Yes, sir,” Harkaway said 
weakly. “I — I kind of figured 
that out myself in these last few 
weeks of intensive soul-searching. 
I — I’m sorry, sir. All I can say 
is that it was an honest mistake.” 
“Why, they weren’t necessarily 
pet-lovers at all. Those animals 
they had with them were . By 



ONCE A GREECH 



137 





Nair al Zaurak!” The captain’s 
voice rose to a shriek as the whole 
enormity of the situation finally 
dawned upon him. “You went 
and kidnaped one of the children!” 
“That’s a serious charge, kid- 
naping,” the first officer said with 
melancholy pleasure. “And you, 
as head of this expedition, Cap- 
tain, are responsible. Ironic, isn’t 
it?” 

“Told you all this spelled doom 
and disaster,” the doctor observed 
cheerfully. 

J UST then, the young humanoid 
sat up — with considerable ef- 
fort, Iversen was disturbed to no- 
tice. But perhaps that was one of 
the consequences of being born. 
A new-born infant was weak; why 
not a new-born adult, then? 

“Why doom?” the humanoid 
asked in a high, clear voice. “Why 
disaster?” 

“You — you speak Terran?” 
the captain stammered. 

Bridey gave his sad, sweet 
smile. “I was reared amongst you. 
You are my people. Why should I 
not speak your tongue?” 

“But we’re not your people,” 
Iversen blurted, thinking perhaps 
the youth did not remember back 
to his greechi days. “We’re an en- 
tirely different species — ■” 

“Our souls vibrate in unison 
and that is the vital essence. But 
do not be afraid, shipmates; the 
Flimbotzik do not regard the ab- 

138 





duction of a transitory corporeal 
shelter as a matter of any great 
moment. Moreover, what took 
place could not rightly be termed 
abduction, for I came with you of 
my own volition — and the Flim- 
botzik recognize individual re- 
sponsibility from the very first 
moment of the psyche’s drawing 
breath in any material casing.” 

Bridey talked so much like 
Harkaway’s book that Iversen 
was almost relieved when, a few 
hours later, the alien died. Of 
course the captain was worried 
about possible repercussions from 
the governments of both Terra 
and Flimbot, in spite of Bridey’s 
assurances. 

And he could not help but feel 
a pang when the young human- 
oid expired in his arms, murmur- 
ing, “Do not grieve for me, soul- 
mates. In the midst of life, there 
is life. 

“Funny,” Smullyan said, with 
one of his disconcerting returns to 
a professional manner, “all the 
other forms seemed perfectly 
healthy. Why did this one go like 
that? Almost as if he wanted to 
die.” 

“He was too good for this ship, 
that’s what,” the radio operator 
said, glaring at the captain. “Too 
fine and brave and — and noble.” 

“Yes,” Harkaway agreed. “What 
truly sensitive soul could exist in 
a stultifying atmosphere like 
this?” 



ONCE A OREBCH 



139 




All the officers glared at the 
captain. He glared back with right 
good will. “How come you gentle- 
men are still with us?” he in- 
quired. “One would have thought 
you would have perished of pure 
sensibility long since, then.” 

“It’s not nice to talk that way,” 
the chief petty officer burst out, 
“not with him lying there not yet 
cold. Ah,” he heaved a long 
sigh, “we’ll never see his like 
again.” 

“Ay, that we won’t,” agreed the 
crew, huddled in the corridor out- 
side the captain’s cabin. 

Iversen sincerely hoped not, 
but he forbore to speak. 

ClNCE Bridey had reached the 
^ ultimate point in his life 
cycle, it seemed certain that he was 
not going to change into anything 
else and so he was given a space- 
man’s burial. Feeling like a put- 
upon fool, Captain Iversen read a 
short prayer as Bridey’s slight 
body was consigned to the vast 
emptiness of space. 

Then the airlock clanged shut 
behind the last mortal remains of 
the ill-fated extraterrestrial and 
that was the end of it. 

But the funereal atmosphere 
did not diminish as the ship 
forged on toward Earth. Gloomy 
days passed, one after the other, 
during which no one spoke, save 
to issue or dispute an order. Look- 
ing at himself one day in the mir- 

140 



ror on his cabin wall, the captain 
realized that he was getting old. 
Perhaps he ought to retire instead 
of still dreaming of a new com- 
mand and a new crew. 

And then one day, as he sat in 
his cabin reading the Spaceman’s 
Credo, the lights on the Herring- 
bone went out, all at once, while 
the constant hum of the motors 
died down slowly, leaving a 
strange, uncomfortable silence. 
Iversen found himself suspended 
weightless in the dark, for the 
gravity, of course, had gone off 
with the power. What, he won- 
dered, had come to pass? He 
often found himself thinking in 
such terms these days. 

Hoarse cries issued from the 
passageway outside; then he 
heard a squeak as his cabin door 
opened and persons unknown 
floated inside, breathing heavily. 

“The power has failed, sir!” 
gasped the first officer’s voice. 

“That has not escaped my no- 
tice,” Iversen said icily. Were not 
even his last moments to be free 
from persecution? 

“It’s all that maniac Smullyan’s 
fault. He stored his mk’oog in the 
fuel tanks. After emptying them 
out first, that is. We’re out of 
fuel.” 

The captain put a finger in his 
book to mark his place, which 
was, he knew with a kind of su- 
pernal detachment, rather foolish, 
because there was no prospect of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




there ever being lights to read by 
again. 

“Put him in irons, if you can 
find him,” he ordered. “And tell 
the men to prepare themselves 
gracefully for a lingering death.” 

Iversen could hear a faint creak 
as the first officer drew himself to 
attention in the darkness. “The 
men of the Herringbone, sir,” he 
said, stiffly, “are always prepared 
for calamity.” 

“Ay, that we are,” agreed vari- 
ous voices. 

So they were all there, were 
they? Well, it was too much to ex- 
pect that they would leave him 
in death any more than they had 
in life. 

“It is well,” Iversen said. “It is 
well,” he repeated, unable to think 
of anything more fitting. 

Q UDDENLY the lights went on 
^ again and the ship gave a 
leap. From his sprawling position 
on the floor, amid his recumbent 
officers, Iversen could hear the 
hum of motors galvanized into 
life. 

“But if . the fuel tanks are 
empty,” he asked of no one in par- 
ticular, “where did the power 
come from?” 

“I am the power,” said a vast, 
deep voice that filled the ship 
from hold to hold. 

“And the glory,” said the radio 
operator reverently. “Don’t forget 
the glory.” 



“No,” the voice replied and it 
was the voice of Bridey, resonant 
with all the amplitude of the im- 
mense chest cavity he had ac- 
quired. “Not the glory, merely the 
power. I have reached a higher 
plane of existence. I am a space- 
ship.” 

“Praise be to the Ultimate 
Nothingness!” Harkaway cried. 

“Ultimate Nothingness, noth- 
ing!” Bridey said impatiently. “I 
achieved it all myself.” 

“Then that’s how the Flimbotzi 
spaceships were powered!” Iver- 
sen exclaimed. “By themselves — 
the Flimbotzik themselves, I 
mean — ■” 

“Even so,” Bridey replied 
grandly. “And this lofty form of 
life happens to be one which we 
poor humans cannot reach unas- 
sisted. Someone has to build the 
shell for us to occupy, which is 
the reason humans dwell together 
in fellowship and harmony — ” 
“You purposely got Harkaway 
to take you aboard the Herring- 
bone ,” Iversen interrupted wrath- 
fully. “You — you stowaway!” 
Bridey’s laugh rang through the 
ship, setting the loose parts quiv- 
ering. “Of course. When first I set 
eyes upon this vessel of yours, I 
saw before me the epitome of all 
dreams. Never had any of our 
kind so splendid an encasement. 
And, upon determining that the 
vessel was, as yet, a soulless 
thing, I got myself aboard; I was

bom, I died, and was reborn again 
with the greatest swiftness conso- 
nant with comfort, so that I could 
awaken in this magnificent form. 
Oh, joy, joy, joy!” 

“You know,” Iversen said, “now 
that I hear one of you talk at 
length, I really can’t blame Hark- 
away for his typically imbecilic 
mistake.” 

“We are a wordy species,” 
Bridey conceded. 

“You had no right to do what 
you did,” Iversen told him, “no 
right to take over — ” 

“But I didn’t take over,” Bridey 
the Herringbone said compla- 
cently. “I merely remained quies- 
cent and content in the knowl- 
edge of my power until yours 
failed. Without me, you would 
even now be spinning in the vasty 
voids, a chrome-trimmed sepul- 
cher. Now, three times as swiftly 
as before, shall I bear you back to 
the planet you very naively call 
home.” 

“Not three times as fast, 
please!” Iversen was quick to 
plead. “The ship isn’t built — 
we're not built to stand such 
speeds.” 

f I ’HE ship sighed. “Disappoint- 
-*■ ment needs must come to all 
— the high, the low, the man, the 
spaceship. It must be borne — ■” 
the voice broke —“bravely. Some- 
how.” 

“What am I going to do?” Iver-

sen asked, turning to the first offi- 
cer for advice for the first time 
ever. “I was planning to ask for a 
transfer or resign my command 
when we got back to Earth. But 
how can I leave Bridey in the 
hands of the IEE(E)?” 

“You can’t, sir,” the first officer 
said. “Neither can we.” 

“If you explain,” Harkaway of- 
fered timidly, “perhaps they’ll 
present the ship to the govern- 
ment.” 

Both Iversen and the first offi- 
cer snorted, united for once. “Not 
the IEE(E),” Iversen said. 
“They’d — they’d exhibit it or 
something and charge admission.” 
“Oh, no,” Bridey cried, “I don’t 
want to be exhibited! I want to 
sail through the trackless paths of 
space. What good is a body like 
this if I cannot use it to its full- 
est?” 

“Have no fear,” Iversen assured 
it. “We’ll just — ” he shrugged, his 
dreams of escape forever blighted 
— “just have to buy the ship from 
the IEE(E), that’s all.” 

“Right you are, sir,” the first 
officer agreed. “We must club to- 
gether, every man Jack of us, and 
buy her. Him. It. That’s the only 
decent thing to do.” 

“Perhaps they won’t sell,” Hark- 
away worried. “Maybe — ” 

“Oh, they’ll sell, all right,” Iver- 
sen said wearily. “They’d sell the 
chairman of the board, if you 
made them an offer, and throw

in all the directors if the price was 
right” 

“And then what will we do?” 
the first officer asked. “Once the 
ship has been purchased, what 
will our course be? What, in other 
words, are we to do?” 

It was Bridey who answered. 
“We will speed through space 
seeking, learning, searching, until 
you — all of you — pass on to 
higher planes and, leaving the 
frail shells you now inhabit, oc- 
cupy proud, splendid vessels like 
the one I wear now. Then, a vast 
transcendent flotilla, we will seek 
other universes. .” 

“But we don’t become space- 
ships,” Iversen said unhappily. 
“We don’t become anything.” 



“How do you know we don’t?” 
Smullyan demanded, appearing 
on the threshold. “How do you 
know what we become? Build 
thee more stately spaceships, O 
my soul!” 

Above all else, Iversen was a 
space officer and dereliction of 
duty could not be condoned even 
in exceptional circumstances. “Put 
him in irons, somebody!” 

“Ask Bridey why there were 
only forty-five spaceships on his 
planet!” the doctor yelled over his 
shoulder as he was dragged off. 
“Ask where the others went — 
where they are now.” 

But Bridey wouldn’t answer 
that question.
