THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know . Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

The Masters had ruled all space with an 
unconquerable iron fist. But the Masters 
were gone. And this new, young race 
who came now to take their place — 
could they hope to defeat the ancient 
Enemy of All?

44DUT didn’t you feel any- 
D thing, Javo?” Strain 
was apparent in every line of 
Tula’s taut, bare body. “Noth- 
ing at all?” 

“Nothing whatever.” The 
one called Javo relaxed from 
his rigid concentration. 
“Nothing has changed. Nor 
will it.” 

“That conclusion is inde- 
fensible !” Tula snapped. 
“With the promised return of 
the Masters there must and 
will be changes. Didn’t any 
of you feel anything?” 

Her hot, demanding eyes 
swept the group ; a group 
whose like, except for physi- 
cal perfection, could be found 
in any nudist colony. 



No one except Tula had 
felt a thing. 

“That fact is not too sur- 
prising,” Javo said finally. 
“You have the most sensitive 
receptors of us all. But are 
you sure?” 

“I am sure. It was the 
though t-form of a living 
Master.” 

“Do you think that the 
Master perceived your web?” 

“It is certain. Those who 
built us are stronger than 
we.” 

“That is true. As they 
promised, then, so long and 
long ago, our Masters are re- 
turning home to us.” 

Jarvis Hilton of Terra, the 
youngest man yet to be as- 
signed to direct any such tre-

taking as Project Theta Ori- 
onis, sat in conference with 
his two seconds-in-command. 
Assistant Director Sandra 
Cummings, analyst-synthesist 
and semantician, was tall, 
blonde and svelte. Planetog- 
rapher William Karns — a 
black-haired, b 1 a c k-browed, 
black-eyed man of thirty — 
was third in rank of the sci- 
entific group. 

“I'm telling you, Jarve, you 
can't have it both ways," 
Karns declared. "Captain 
Sawtelle is old-school Navy 
brass. He goes strictly by the 
book. So you’ve got to draw 
a razor-sharp line ; exactly 
where the Advisory Board’s 
directive puts it. And next 
time he sticks his ugly puss 
across that line, kick his face 
in. You’ve been Caspar Mil- 
quetoast Two ever since we 
left Base.’’ 

"That’s the way it looks to 
you?" Hilton’s right hand be- 
came a fist. "The man has 
age, experience and ability. 
I’ve been trying to meet him 
on a ground of courtesy and 
decency." 

"Exactly. And he doesn’t 
recognize the existence of 
either. And, since the Board 
rammed you down his throat 
instead of giving him old 
Jeffers, you needn’t expect 
him to." 

"You may be right. Bill. 
What do you think, Dr. Cum- 
mings?" 

The girl said: "Bill’s right. 
Also, your constant appease- 



ment isn’t doing the morale 
of the whole scientific group 
a bit of good." 

"Well, I haven’t enjoyed it, 
either. So next time I’ll pin 
his ears back. Anything 
else?" 

"Yes, Dr. Hilton, I have a 
squawk of my own. I know I 
was rammed down your 
throat, but just when are you 
going to let me do some 
work?" 

"None of us has much of 
anything to do yet, and won’t 
Jiave until we light some- 
where. You’re off base a 
country mile." 

"I’m not off base. You did 
want Eggleston, not me.” 

"Sure I did. I’ve worked 
with him and know what he 
can do. But I’m not holding a 
grudge about it." 

"No? Why, then, are you 
on first-name terms with 
everyone in the scientific 
group except me? Supposed- 
ly your first assistant?’’ 

"That’s easy!" Hilton 
snapped. "Because you’ve 
been carrying chips on both 
shoulders ever since you 
came aboard. .or at least I 
thought you were.” Hilton 
grinned suddenly and held 
out his hand. "Sorry, Sandy — 
I’ll start all over again." 

"I’m sorry too, Chief." 
They shook hands warmly. 
"I was pretty stiff, I guess, 
but I’ll be good." 

"You’ll go to work right 
now, too. As semantician. Dig 
out that directive and tear it

down. Draw that line Bill 
talked about/’ 

“Can do, boss.” She swung 
to her feet and walked out of 
the room, her every move- 
ment one of lithe and easy 
grace. 

Karns followed her with 
his eyes. “Funny. A trained- 
dancer Ph.D. And a Miss 
America type, like all the 
other women aboard this 
spacer. I wonder if she’ll 
make out.” 

“So do I. I still wish they’d 
given me Eggy. I’ve never 
seen an executive-type female 
Ph.D. yet that was worth the 
cyanide it would take to poi- 
son her.” 

“That’s what Sawtelle 
thinks of you, too, you 
know.” 

“I know; and the Board 
does know its stuff. So I’m 
really hoping, Bill, that she 
surprises me as much as I in- 
tend to surprise the Navy.” 

A LARM b e 1 1 s clanged as 
the mighty Perseus 
blinked out of overdrive. 
Every crewman sprang to his 
post. 

. “Mister Snowden, why did 
we emerge without orders 
from me?” Captain Sawtelle 
bellowed, storming into the 
control room three jumps be- 
hind Hilton. 

“The automatics took con- 
trol, sir,” he said, quietly. 

“Automatics! I give the or- 
ders!” 



“In this case. Captain Saw- 
telle, you don’t,” Hilton said. 
Eyes locked and held. To 
Sawtelle, this was a new and 
strange co-commander. “I 
would suggest that we dis- 
cuss this matter in private.” 
“Very well, sir,” Sawtelle 
said ; and in the captain’s 
cabin Hilton opened up. 

“For your information, 
Captain Sawtelle, I set my in- 
ter-space coupling detectors 
for any objective I choose. 
When any one of them reacts, 
it trips the kickers and we 
emerge. During any emer- 
gency outside the Solar Sys- 
tem I am in command — with 
the provision that I must re- 
linquish command to you in 
case of armed attack on us.” 
“Where do you think you 
found any such stuff as that 
in the directive? It isn’t there 
and I know my rights.” 

“It is, and you don’t. Here 
is a semantic chart of the 
whole directive. As you will 
note, it overrides many Navy 
regulations. Disobedience of 
my orders constitutes mutiny 
and I can — and will — have 
you put in irons and sent 
back to Terra for court-mar- 
tial. Now let’s go back.” 

In the control room, Hilton 
said, “The target has a mass 
of approximately five hun- 
dred metric . tons. There is 
also a significant amount of 
radiation characteristic of 
uranexite. You will please ex- 
ecute search. Captain Saw- 
telle” 



MASTERS OF SPACE

And Captain Sawtelle or- 
dered the search. 

“What did you do to the 
big jerk, boss?” Sandra whis- 
pered. 

“What you and Bill sug- 
gested,” Hilton whispered 
back. “Thanks to your analy- 
sis of the directive — pure 
gobbledygook if there ever 
was any — I could. Mighty 
good job, Sandy.” 

T EN or fifteen more min- 
utes passed. Then: 

“Here’s the source of radi- 
ation, sir,” a searchman re- 
ported. “It’s a point source, 
though, not an object at this 
range.” 

“And here’s the artifact, 
sir,” Pilot Snowden said. 
“We’re coming up on it fast. 
But... but what’s a skyscrap- 
er skeleton doing out here in 
interstellar space ?” 

As they closed up, every- 
one could see that the thing 
did indeed look like the 
metallic skeleton of a great 
building. It was a huge cube, 
measuring well over a hun- 
dred yards along each edge. 
And it was empty. 

“That’s one for the book,” 
Sawtelle said. 

“And how!” Hilton agreed. 
“I’ll take a boat... no, suits 
would be better. “Karns, Yar- 
borough, get Techs Leeds and 
Miller and suit up.” 

“You’ll need a boat escort,” 
Sawtelle said. “Mr. Ashley, 
execute escort Landing Craft 
One, Two, and Three.” 



The three landing craft ap- 
proached that enigmatic lat- 
tice-work of structural steel 
and stopped. Five grotesque- 
ly armored figures wafted 
themselves forward on pen- 
cils of force. Their leader, 
whose suit bore the number 
“14”, reached a mammoth 
girder and worked his way 
along it up to a peculiar-look- 
ing bulge. The whole immense 
structure vanished, leaving 
men and boats in empty 
space. 

Sawtelle gasped. “Snow- 
den! Are you holding ’em?” 
“No, sir. Faster than light; 
hyperspace, sir.” 

“Mr. Ashby, did you have 
your interspace rigs set?” 
“No, sir. I didn’t think of 
it, sir.” 

“Doctor Cummings, why 
weren’t yours out?” 

“I didn’t think of such a 
thing, either — any more than 
you did,” Sandra said. 

Ashby, the Communica- 
tions Officer, had been work- 
ing the radio. “No reply from 
anyone, sir,” he reported. 

“Oh, no!” Sandra ex- 
claimed. Then, “But look! 
They’re firing pistols — espe- 
cially the one wearing num- 
ber fourteen — but pistols?” 
“Recoil pistol s — sixty- 
threes — for emergency use in 
case of power failure,” Ashby 
explained. “That’s it... but I 
can’t see why all their power 
went out at once. But Four- 
teen — that’s Hilton — is really 
doing a job with that sixty-

three. He'll be here in a cou- 
ple of minutes.” 

And he was. “Every pow- 
er unit out there — suits 

and boats both— d r a i n e d,” 
Hilton reported. “Complete- 
ly. drained. Get some help 
out there fast !” 

In an enormous structure 
deep below the surface of a 
far-distant world a group of 
technicians clustered togeth- 
er in front of one section of 
a two-miles long control 
board. They were staring at a 
light that had just appeared 
where no light should have 
been. 

“Someone’s brain-pan will 
be burned out for this,” one 
of the group radiated harshly. 
“That unit was inactivated 
long ago and it has not been 
reactivated/’ 

“Someone committed an er- 
ror, Your Loftiness?” 

“Silence, fool! Stretts do 
not commit errors!” 

A S soon as it was clear that 
no one had been injured, 
Sawtelle demanded, “How 
about it, Hilton?” 

“Structurally, it was high- 
alloy steel. There were many 
bulges, possibly containing 
mechanisms. There were 
drive-units of a non-Terran 
type. There were many pro- 
jectors, which — at a rough 
guess — were a hundred times 
as powerful as any I have 
ever seen before. There were 
no indications that the thing 



had ever been enclosed, in 
whole or in part. It certainly 
never had living quarters for 
warm-blooded, oxygen-breath- 
ing eaters of organic food.” 
Sawtelle snorted. “You 
mean it never had a crew?” 
“Not necessarily...” 

“Bah! What other kind of 
intelligent life is there?” 

“I don’t know. But before 
we speculate too much, let’s 
look at the tri-di. The camera 
may have caught something I 
missed.” 

It hadn’t. The three-dimen- 
sional pictures added nothing. 

“It probably was operated 
either by programmed auto- 
matics or by remote control,” 
Hilton decided, finally. “But 
how did they drain all our 
power? And just as bad, what 
and how is that other point 
source of power we’re head- 
ing for now?” 

“What’s wrong with it?” 
Sawtelle asked. 

“Its strength. No matter 
what distance or reactant I 
assume, nothing we know will 
fit. Neither fission nor fusion 
will do it. It has to be prac- 
tically total conversion!” 

II 

T HE Perseus snapped out 
of overdrive near the point 
of interest and Hilton stared, 
motionless and silent. 

Space was full of madly 
warring ships. Half of them 
were bare, giant skeletons of 
steel, like the “derelict” that 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



11 




had so unexpectedly blasted 
away from them. The others 
were more or less like the 
Perseus, except in being big- 
ger, faster and of vastly 
greater power. 

Beams of starkly incredible 
power bit at and clung to 
equally capable defensive 
screens of pure force. As 
those inconceivable forces 
met, the glare of their neu- 
tralization filled all nearby 
space. And ships and skele- 
tons alike were disappearing 
in chunks, blobs, gouts, 
streamers and sparkles of 
rended, fused and vaporized 
metal. 

Hilton watched two ships 
combine against one skeleton. 
Dozens of beams, incredibly 
tight and hard, were held in- 
exorably upon dozens of 
the bulges of the skeleton. 
Overloaded, the bulges’ 
screens flared through the 
spectrum and failed. And 
bare metal, however refrac- 
tory, endures only for in- 
stants under the appalling in- 
tensity of such beams as 
those. 

The skeletons tried to du- 
plicate the ships’ method of 
attack, but failed. They were 
too slow. Not slow, exactly, 
either, but hesitant ; as though 
it required whole seconds for 
the commander — or operator? 
Or remote controller? — of 
each skeleton to make it act. 
The ships were winning. 

“Hey!” Hilton yelped. “Oh 
— that’s the one we saw back 

12 



there. But what in all space 
does it think it’s doing?” 

It was plunging at tremen- 
dous speed straight through 
the immense fleet of embat- 
tled skeletons. It did not fire 
a beam nor energize a screen; 
it merely plunged along as 
though on a plotted course 
until it collided with one of 
the skeletons of the fleet and 
both structures plunged, a 
tangled mass of wreckage, to 
the ground of the planet be- 
low. 

Then hundreds of the ships 
shot forward, each to plunge 
into and explode inside one of 
the skeletons. When visibility 
was restored another wave of 
ships came forward to repeat 
the performance, but there 
was nothing left to fight. 
Every surviving skeleton had 
blinked out of normal space. 

The remaining ships made 
no effort to pursue the skele- 
tons, nor did they re-form as 
a fleet. Each ship went off 
by itself. 

* * * 

And on that distant planet 
of the Stretts the group of 
mechs watched with amazed 
disbelief as light after light 
after light winked out on 
their two-miles-long control 
board. Frantically they re- 
layed orders to the skeletons; 
orders which did not affect 
the losses. 

“Brain-pans will blacken 
for this...” a mental snarl 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




began, to be interrupted by a 
coldly imperious thought. 

"That long-dead unit, so in- 
explicably reactivated, is ap- 
proaching the fuel world. It 
is ignoring the battle. It is 
heading through our fleet to- 
ward the Oman half. han- 
dle it, ten-eighteen!” 

"It does not respond, Your 
Loftiness.” 

"Then blast it, fool! Ah, it 
is inactivated. As encyclo- 
pedist, Nine, explain the 
freakish behavior of that 
unit.” 

"Yes, Your Loftiness. Many 
cycles ago we sent a ship 
against the Omans with a new 
device of destruction. The 
Omans must have intercepted 
it, drained it of power and al- 
lowed it to drift on. After all 
these cycles of time it must 
have come upon a small 
source of power and of course 
continued its mission.” 

"That can be the truth. The 
Lords of the Universe must 
be informed.” 

"The mining units, the car- 
riers and the refiners have 
not been affected, Your Loft- 
iness,” a mech radiated. 

"So I see, fool.” Then, ac- 
tivating another instrument, 
His Loftiness thought at it, 
in an entirely different vein, 
"Lord Ynos, Madam? I have 
to make a very grave re- 
port. ..” 

I N the Perseus , four scien- 
tists and three Navy offi- 
cers were arguing heatedly; 



employing deep-space verbi- 
age not to be found in any 
dictionary. "Jarve !” Klaras 
called out, and Hilton joined 
the group. "Does anything 
about this planet make any 
sense to you?” 

"No. But you’re the plane- 
tographer. ’Smatter with it?” 
"It’s a good three hundred 
degrees Kelvin too hot.” 
"Well, you know it’s load- 
ed with uranexite.” 

"That much? The whole 
crust practically * j e welry

"If that’s what the figures 
say, I’ll buy it.” 

"Buy this , then. Continu-

the whole thing’s impossi-

"When Frank makes up his 
mind what ‘something’ is. I’ll 
take it as a datum.” 

"Third thing: there’s only 
one city on this continent, 
and it’s protected by a screen 
that nobody ever heard of.” 
Hilton pondered, then 
turned to the captain. "Will 
you please run a search-pat- 
tern, sir? Fine-toothing only 
the hot spots?” 

The planet was approxi- 
mately the same size as 
Terra; its atmosphere, except 
for its intense radiation, was 
similar to Terra’s. There were 
two continents; one immense

like a three-wheeled motor 
scooter, which was moving 
carefully along beside the 
giant miner. When this can 
was almost full another scoot- 
er rolled up and, without los- 
ing a single pellet, took over 
place and function. The first 
scooter then covered its buck- 
et, clamped it solidly into a 
recess designed for the pur- 
pose and dashed away toward 
the city. 

Hilton stared slack-jawed 
at Sandra. She stared back. 

"Do you make anything of 
that, Jarve?” 

"Nothing. They’re taking 
pure uranexite and concen- 
trating — or converting — it a 
thousand to one. I hope we’ll 
be able to do something about 
it.” 

"I hope so, too, Chief; and 
I’m sure we will.” 

"Well, that’s enough for 
now. You may take us up 
now, Captain Sawtelle. And 
Sandy, will you please call 
all department heads and 
their assistants into the con- 
ference room?” 

A T the head of the long 
conference table, Hilton 
studied his fourteen depart- 
ment heads, all husky young 
men, and their assistants, all 
surprisingly attractive and 
well-built young women. Bud 
Carroll and Sylvia Bannister 
of Sociology sat together. He 
was almost as big as Karns; 
she was a green-eyed redhead 
whose five-ten and one-fifty 

1ft 



would have looked big except 
for the arrangement thereof. 
There were Bernadine and 
Hermione van der Moen, the 
leggy, breasty, platinum- 
blonde twins — both of whom 
were Cowper medalists in 
physics. There was Etienne 
de Vaux, the mathematical 
wizard ; and Rebecca Eisen- 
tein, the black-haired, flash- 
ing-eyed ex-i n f a n t-prodigy 
theoretical astronomer. There 
was Beverly Bell, who made 
mathematically impossible 
chemical syntheses — who 
swam channels for days on 
end and computed planetary 
orbits in her sleekly-coiffured 
head. 

"First, we’ll have a get-to- 
gether,” Hilton said. "Nothing 
recorded; just to get acquaint- 
ed. You all know that our 
fourteen departments cover 
science, from astronomy to 
zoology.” 

He paused, again his eyes 
swept the group. Stella Wing, 
who would have been a grand- 
opera star except for her 
drive to know everything 
about language. Theodora 
(Teddy) Blake, who would 
prove gleefully that she was 
the world’s best model — but 
was in fact the most brilliant- 
ly promising theoretician who 
had ever lived. 

"No other force like this 
has ever been assembled,” 
Hilton went on. "In more 
ways than one. Sawtelle want- 
ed Jeffers to head this group, 
instead of me. Everybody 



by Edward E. Smith At E. Everett Evens 




thought he would head it.” 
“And Hilton wanted Eg- 
gleston and got me ” Sandra 
said. 

“That’s right. And quite a 
few of you didn’t want to 
come at all, but were told by 
the Board to come or else.” 
The group stirred. Eyes 
met eyes, and there were 
smiles. 

UT myself think Jeffers 
A should have had the job. 
I’ve never handled anything 
half this big and I’ll need a 
lot of help. But I’m stuck 
with it and you’re all stuck 
with me, so we’ll all take it 
and like it. You’ve noticed, 
of course, the accent on 
youth. The Navy crew is nor- 
mal, except for the command- 
ers being unusually young. 
But we aren’t. None of us is 
thirty yet, and none of us has 
ever been married. You fel- 
lows look like a team of pro- 
fessional athletes, and you 
girls — well, if I didn’t know 
better I’d say the Board had 
screened you for the front 
row of the chorus instead of 
for a top-bracket brain-gang. 
How they found so many of 
you I’ll never know.” 

“Virile men and nubile 
women!” Etienne de Vaux 
leered enthusiastically. “Vive 
le Board!" 

“Nubile! Bravo, Tiny ! 
Quelle delicatesse de 
nuance /” 

‘“Three rousing cheers for 
the Board!” 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



“Keep still, you nitwits ! 
Let me ask a question!” This 
came from one of the twins. 
“Before you give us the de- 
duction, Jarvis — or will it be 
an intuition or an induction 
or a. 

“Or an inducement,” the 
other twin suggested, help- 
fully. “Not that you would 
need very much of that.” 

“You keep still, too, Miney. 
I’m asking, Sir Moderator, if 
I can give my deduction 
first?” 

“Sure, Bernadine: go 

ahead.” 

“They figured we’re going 
to get completely lost. Then 
we’ll jettison the Navy, hunt 
up a planet of our own and 
start a race to end all human 
races. Or would you call this 
a see-duction instead of a dee- 
duction?” 

This produced a storm of 
whistles, cheers and jeers 
that it took several seconds 
to quell. 

“But seriously, J a r-v i s,” 
Bernadine went on. “We’ve 
all been wondering and it 
doesn’t make sense. Have you 
any idea at all of what the 
Board actually did have in 
mind?” 

“I believe that the Board 
selected for mental, not phys- 
ical, qualities: for the ability 
to handle anything unexpect- 
ed or unusual that comes up, 
no matter what it is.” 

“You think it wasn’t dou- 
ble-barreled?” asked Kincaid, 
the psychologist. He smiled 

17 




quizzically. “That all this vir- 
ility and nubility and glamor 
is pure coincidence ?” 

“No/' Hilton said, with an 
almost imperceptible flick of 
an eyelid. “Coincidence is as 
meaningless as 'paradox. I 
think they found out that — 
barring freaks — the best 
minds are in the best bodies.” 
“Could be. The idea has 
been profounded before.” 
“Now let’s get to work.” 
Hilton flipped the switch of 
the recorder. “Starting with 
you, Sandy, each of you give 
a two-minute boil-down. What 
you found and what you 
think.” 

S OMETHING over an hour 
later the meeting ad- 
journed and Hilton and San- 
dra strolled toward the con- 
trol room. 

“I don’t know whether you 
convinced Alexander Q. Kin- 
caid or not, but you didn’t 
quite convince me,” Sandra 
said. 

“Nor him, either.” 

“Oh?” Sandra’s eyebrows 
went up. 

“No. He grabbed the out I 
offered him. I didn’t fool 
Teddy Blake or Temple Bells, 
either. You four are all, 
though, I think.” 

“Temple? You think she’s 
so smart?” 

“I don’t think so, no. Don’t 
fool yourself, chick. Temple 
Bells looks and acts sweet 
and innocent and virginal. 
Maybe — probably — she is. But 



she isn’t showing a fraction of 
the stuff she’s really got. 
She’s heavy artillery, Sandy. 
And I mean heavy.” 

“I think you’re slightly 
nuts there. But do you really 
believe that the Board was 
playing Cupid?” 

“Not trying, but doing. 
Cold-bloodedly and efficient- 
ly. Yes.” 

“But it wouldn’t work\ We 
aren’t going to get lost!” 
“We won’t need to. Pro- 
pinquity will do the work.” 
“Phooie. You and me, for 
instance?” She stopped, put 
both hands on her hips, and 
glared. “Why, I wouldn’t 
marry you if you ...” 

“I’ll tell the cockeyed world 
you won’t!” Hilton broke in. 
“Me marry a damned female 
Ph. D.? Uh-uh. Mine will be 
a cuddly little brunette that 
thinks a slipstick is some kind 
of lipstick and that an iso- 
tope’s something good to eat.” 
“One like that copy of 
Murchison’s Dark Lady that 
you keep under the glass on 
your desk?” she sneered. 

“Exactly...” He started to 
continue the battle, then shut 
himself off. “But listen, San- 
dy, why should we get into 
a fight because we don’t want 
to marry each other? You’re 
doing a swell job. I admire 
you tremendously for it and 
I like to work with you.” 
“You’ve got a point there, 
Jarve, at that, and I’m one of 
the few who know what kind 
of a job you’re doing, so I’ll

relax.” She flashed him a 
gamin grin and they went on 
into the control room. 

It was too late in the day 
then to do any more explor- 
ing; but the next morning, 
early, the Perseus lined out 
for the city of the humanoids. 

Tula turned toward her fel- 
lows. Her eyes filled with a 
happily triumphant light and 
her thought a lilting song. “I 
have been telling you from 
the first touch that it was the 
Masters. It is the Masters! 
The Masters are returning to 
us Omans and their own home 
world !” 

«/^APTAIN Sawtelle,” Hil- 
^ ton said, “Please land 
in the cradle below.” 

“Land!” Sawtelle stormed. 
“On a planet like that? Not 
by...” He broke off and 
stared; for now, on that cra- 
dle, there flamed out in 
screaming red the Perseus ' 
own Navy-coded landing sym- 
bols! 

“Your protest is recorded,” 
Hilton said. “Now, sir, land.” 
Fuming, Sawtelle landed. 
Sandra looked pointedly at 
Hilton. “First contact is my 
dish, you know.” 

“Not that I like it, but it 
is.” He turned to a burly 
youth with sun-b leached, 
crew-cut hair, “Still safe, 
Frank?” 

“Still abnormally low. Sur- 
prising no end, since all the 
rest of the planet is hotter 



than the middle tail-race of 
hell.” 

“Okay, Sandy. Who will 
you want besides the top lin- 
guists?” 

“Psyc h — both Alex and 
Temple. And Teddy Blake. 
They're over there. Tell them, 
will you, while I buzz Ted- 
dy?” 

“Will do,” and Hilton 
stepped over to the two psy- 
chologists and told them. 
Then, “I hope I'm not leading 
with my chin, Temple, but is 
that your real first name or 
a professional?” 

“It's real; it really is. My 
parents were romantics : dad 
says they considered both 
‘Golden' and ‘Silver’!” 

Not at all obviously, he 
studied her: the almost trans- 
lucent, unblemished perfec- 
tion of her lightly-tanned, 
old-ivory skin ; the clear, 
calm, deep blueness of her 
eyes; the long, thick mane of 
hair exactly the color of a 
field of dead-ripe wheat. 

“You know, I like it,” he 
said then. “It fits you.” 

“I'm glad you said that. 
Doctor. .” 

“Not that, Temple. I’m not 
going to ‘Doctor’ you.” 

“I'll call you ‘boss’, then, 
like Stella does. Anyway, that 
lets me tell you that I like 
it myself. I really think that 
it did something for me.” 

“ Something did something 
for you, that’s for sure. I’m 
mighty glad you’re aboard. 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



19 




and I hope. , .here they come. 
Hi, Hark! Hi, Stella !” 

“Hi, Jarve,” said Chief 
Linguist Harkins, and: 

“Hi, boss — what’s holding 
us up?” asked his assistant, 
Stella Wing. She was about 
five feet four. Her eyes were 
a tawny brown ; her hair a 
flamboyant auburn mop. Per- 
haps it owed a little of its 
spectacular refulgence to 
chemistry, Hilton thought, 
but not too much. “Let us 
away! Let the lions roar and 
let the welkin ring!” \ 
“Who’s been feeding you 
so much red meat, little 
squirt?” Hilton laughed and 
turned away, meeting Sandra 
in the corridor. “Okay, chick, 
take ’em away. We’ll cover 
you. Luck, girl.” 

And in the control room, 
to Sawtelle, “Needle-beam 
cover, please ; set for mini- 
mum aperture and lethal 
blase. But no firing, Captain 
Sawtelle, until I give the or- 
der.” 

T HE Perseus was surround- 
ed by hundreds of natives. 
They were all adult, all nak- 
ed and about equally divided 
as to sex. They were friend- 
ly; most enthusiastically so. 

“Jarve!” Sandra squealed. 
“They’re telepathic . Very 
strongly so! I never imagined 
— I never felt anything like 
it !” 

“Any rough stuff?” Hilton 
demanded. 

“Oh, no. Just the opposite 



They love us . in a way that’s 
simply indescribable. I don’t 
like this telepathy business 
...not clear. .foggy, diffuse 
. this woman is sure I’m her 
long-lost great-great-a-hun- 
dred-times grandmother or 
something — You ! Slow down. 
Take it easy! They want us 
all to come out here and live 
with. no, not with them, but 
each of us alone in a whole 
house with them to wait on 
us! But first, they all want 
to come aboard .” 

“ What ?” Hilton yelped. 
“But are you sure they’re 
friendly?” 

“Positive, chief.” 

“How about you, Alex?” 
“We’re all sure, Jarve. No 
question about it.” 

“Bring two of them aboard. 
A man and a woman.” 

“You won’t bring any!” 
Sawtelle thundered. “Hilton, 
I had enough of your stupid, 
starry-eyed, ivory-d o m e d 
blundering long ago, but this 
utterly idiotic brainstorm of 
letting enemy aliens aboard 
us ends all civilian command. 
Call your people back aboard 
or I will bring them in by 
force !” 

“Very well, sir. Sandy, tell 
the natives that a slight de- 
lay has become necessary and 
bring your party aboard.” 

The Navy officers smiled — 
or grinned — gloatingly; while 
the scientists stared at their 
director with expressions 
ranging from surprise to dis- 
appointment and disgust. 



20

Hilton’s face remained set, ex- 
pressionless, until Sandra and 
her party had arrived. 

“Captain Sawtell e,” he said 
then, “I thought that you and 
I had settled in private the 
question of who is in com- 
mand of Project Theta Ori- 
onis at destination. We will 
now settle it in public. Your 
opinion of me is now on rec- 
ord, witnessed by your offi- 
cers and by my staff. My 
opinion of you, which is now 
being similarly recorded and 
witnessed, is that you are a 
hidebound, mentally ossified 
Navy mule; mentally and psy- 
chologically unfit to have any 
voice in any such mission as 
this. You will now agree, on 
this recording and before 
these witnesses, to obey my 
orders unquestioningly or I 
will now unload all Bureau of 
Science personnel and equip- 
ment onto this planet and 
send you and the Perseus 
back to Terra with the doub- 
ly-sealed record of this epi- 
sode posted to the Advisory 
Board. Take your choice.” 

Eyes locked, and under 
Hilton’s uncompromising 
stare Sawtelle weakened. He 
fidgeted; tried three times — 
unsuccessfully — to blare de- 
fiance. Then, “Very well sir,” 
he said, and saluted. 

UHnHANK you, sir,” Hilton 
said, then turned to his 
staff. “Okay, Sandy, go 
ahead.” 

Outside the control room 



door, “Thank God you don’t 
play poker, Jarve!” Karns 
gasped. “We’d all owe you all 
the pay we’ll ever get!” 

“You think it was the bluff, 
yes?” de Vaux asked. “Me, I 
think no. Name of a name of 
a name ! I was wondering with 
unease what life would be like 
on this so-alien planet!” 
“You didn’t need to won- 
der, Tiny,” Hilton assured 
him. “It was in the bag. He’s 
incapable of abandonment.” 
Beverly Bell, the van der 
Noen twins and Temple Bells 
all stared at Hilton in awe; 
and Sandra felt much the 
same way. 

“But suppose he had called 
you?” Sandra demanded. 

“Speculating on the impos- 
sible is unprofitable,” he said. 

“Oh, you’re the most exas- 
perating thing !” Sandra 
stamped a foot. “Don’t you — 
ever — answer a question intel- 
ligibly?” 

“When the question is 
meaningless, chick, I can’t.” 
At the lock Temple Bells, 
who had been hanging back, 
cocked an eyebrow at Hilton 
and he made his way to her 
side. 

“What was it you started to 
say back there, boss?” 

“Oh, yes. That we should 
see each other oftener.” 
“That’s what I was hoping 
you were going to say.” She 
put her hand under his elbow 
and pressed his arm lightly, 
fleetingly, against her side. 
“That would be indubitably 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



21 




the fondest thing I could be 
of” 

He laughed and gave her 
arm a friendly squeeze. Then 
he studied her again, the most 
baffling member of his staff. 
About five feet six. Lithe, 
hard, trained down fine — as a 
tennis champion, she would 
be. Stacked — how she was 
stacked! Not as beautiful as 
Sandra or Teddy... but with 
an ungodly lot of something 
that neither of them had . 
nor any other woman he had 
ever known. 

“Yes, I am a little difficult 
to classify,” she said quietly, 
almost reading his mind. 

“That’s the understatement 
of the year! But I’m making 
some progress.” 

“Such as?” This was an 
open challenge. 

“Except possibly Teddy, 
the best brain aboard.” 

“That isn’t true, but go 
ahead.” 

“Y o u ’ r e a powerhouse. A 
tightly organized, thoroughly 
integrated, smoothly func- 
tioning, beautifully camou- 
flaged Juggernaut. A reason- 
able facsimile of an irresis- 
tible force.” 

“My God, Jarvis!” That 
had gone deep. 

“Let me finish my analysis. 
You aren’t head of your de- 
partment because you don’t 
want to be. You fooled the 
top psychs of the Board. 
You’ve been running ninety 
per cent submerged because 
you can work better that way 



and there’s no glory-hound 
blood in you.” 

She stared at him, licking 
her lips. “I knew your mind 
was a razor, but I didn’t know 
it was a diamond drill, too. 
That seals your doom, boss, 
unless. .. no, you can’t pos- 
sibly know why I’m here.” 
“Why, of course I do.” 
“You just think you do. 
You see, I’ve been in love 
with you ever since, as a gan- 
gling, bony, knobby-kneed 
kid, I listened to your first 
doctorate disputation. Ever 
since then, my purpose in life 
has been to land you.” 

Ill 

UDUT listen!” he ex- 
" claimed. “I can't, even 
if I want. .” 

“Of course you can’t.” Pure 
deviltry danced in her eyes. 
“You’re the Director. It 
wouldn’t be proper. But it’s 
Standard Operating Proce- 
dure for simple, innocent, un- 
sophisticated little country 
girls like me to go completely 
overboard for the boss.” 

“But you can’ t — you 
mustn't!" he protested in 
panic. 

Temple Bells was getting 
plenty of revenge for the 
shocks he had given her. “I 
can’t? Watch me!” She 
grinned up at him, her eyes 
still dancing. “Every chance 
I get, I’m going to hug your 
arm like I did a minute ago. 
And you’ll take hold of my 



22 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




forearm, like you did! That 
can be taken, you see, as ei- 
ther : One, a reluctant ac- 

ceptance of a mildly distaste- 
ful but not quite actionable 
situation, or: Two, a blocking 
move to keep me from climb- 
ing up you like a squirrel !” 

“Confound it, Temple, you 
can't be serious!” 

“Can’t I?” She laughed 
gleefully. “Especially with 
half a dozen of those other 
cats watching? Just wait and 
see, boss!” 

Sandra and her two guests 
came aboard. The natives 
looked around ; the man at 
the various human men, the 
woman at each of the human 
women. The woman remained 
beside Sandra; the man took 
his place at Hilton’s left, 
looking up — he was a couple 
of inches shorter than Hil- 
ton’s six feet one — with an 
air of..%of expectancy! 

“Why this arrangement, 
Sandy?” Hilton asked. 

“Because we’re tops. It’s 
your move, Jarve. What’s 
first?” 

“Uranexite. Come along, 
Sport. I’ll call you that un- 
til...” 

“Laro,” the native said, in 
a deep resonant bass voice. 
He hit himself a blow on the 
head that would have floored 
any two ordinary men. 
“Sora,” he announced, strik- 
ing the alien woman a similar 
blow. 

“Laro and Sora, I would 
like to have you look at our 



uranexite, with the idea of re- 
fueling our ship. Come with 
me, please?” 

Both nodded and followed 
him. In the engine room he 
pointed at the engines, then 
to the lead-blocked labyrinth 
leading to the fuel holds. 
“Laro, do you understand 
'hot’? Radioactive?” 

Laro nodded — and started 
to open the heavy lead door! 

“Hey!” Hilton yelped. 
“That’s hot!” He seized 
Laro’s arm to pull him away 
— and got the shock of* his 
life. Laro weighed at least 
five hundred pounds! And 
the guy still looked human! 

Laro nodded again and 
gave himself a terrific thump 
on the chest. Then he glanced 
at Sora, who stepped away 
from Sandra. He then went 
into the hold and came out 
with two fuel pellets in his 
hand, one of which he tossed 
to Sora. That is, the motion 
looked like a toss, but the 
pellet traveled like a bullet. 
Sora caught it unconcernedly 
and both natives flipped the 
pellets into their mouths. 
There was a half minute of 
rock-crusher crunching; then 
both natives opened their 
mouths. 

The pellets had been pul- 
verized and swallowed. 

Hilton’s voice rang out. 
“Poynter! How can these 
people be non-radioactive af- 
ter eating a whole fuel pellet 
apiece?” 

Poynter tested both natives 



MASTERS OF SPACE

again. “Cold,” he reported. 
“Stone cold. No background 
even. Play that on your har- 
monica !” 

L ARO nodded, perfectly 
matter-of-factly, and in 
Hilton’s mind there formed a 
picture. It was not clear, but 
it showed plainly enough a 
long line of aliens approach- 
ing the Perseus . Each carried 
on his or her shoulder a lead 
container holding two hun- 
dred pounds of Navy Regula- 
tion fuel pellets. A standard 
loading-tube was sealed into 
place and every fuel-hold was 
filled. 

This picture, Laro indicat- 
ed plainly, could become re- 
ality any time. 

Sawtelle was notified and 
came on the run. “No fuel is 
coming aboard without being 
tested!” he roared. 

“Of course not. But it’ll 
pass, for all the tea in China. 
You haven’t^ had a ten per 
cent load of fuel since you 
were launched. You can fill 
up or not — the fuel’s here — 
just as you say.” 

“If they can make Navy 
standard, of course we want 
it.” 

The fuel arrived. Every 
load tested well above stand- 
ard. Every fuel hold was 
filled to capacity, with no 
leakage and no emanation. 
The natives who had handled 
the stuff did not go away, but 
gathered in the engine-room; 
and more and more humans 



trickled in to see what was 
going on. 

Sawtelle stiffened. “What’s 
going on over there, Hilton?” 

“I don’t know; but let’s let 
’em go for a minute. I want 
to learn about these people 
and they’ve got me stopped 
cold.” 

“You aren’t the only one. 
But if they wreck that May- 
field it’ll cost you over twen- 
ty thousand dollars.” 

“Okay.” The captain and di- 
rector watched, wide eyed. 

Two master mechanics had 
been getting ready to re-fit a 
tube — a job requiring both 
strength and skill. The tube 
was very heavy and made of 
superefract. The machine — 
the Mayfield — upon which 
the work was to be done, was 
extremely complex. 

Two of the aliens had 
brushed the mechanics — very 
gently — aside and were doing 
their work for them. Ignor- 
ing the hoist, one native had 
picked the tube up and was 
holding it exactly in place on 
the Mayfield. The other, 
hands moving faster than the 
eye could follow, was locking 
it — micrometrically precise 

and immovably secure — into 
place. 

“How about this?” one of 
the mechanics asked of his 
immediate superior. “If we 
throw ’em out, how do we do 
it?” 

By a jerk of the head, the 
non-com passed the buck to a 
commissioned officer, who 



24 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




relayed it up the line to Saw- 
telle, who said, “Hilton, no- 
body can run a Mayfield 
without months of training. 
They’ll wreck it and it’ll cost 
you... but I’m getting curi- 
ous myself. Enough so to take 
half the damage. Let ’em go 
ahead.” 

“How about this, Mike?” 
one of the machinists asked 
of his fellow. “I’m going to 
like this, what?” 

“Ya-as, my deah Chumley,” 
the other drawled, affectedly. 
“My man relieves me of so 
much uncouth effort.” 

The natives had kept on 
working. The Mayfield was 
running. It had always 
howled and screamed at its 
work, but now it gave out 
only a smooth and even hum. 
The aliens had adjusted it 
with u n h u m a n precision ; 
they were one with it as no 
human being could possibly 
be. And every mind present 
knew that those aliens were, 
at long, long last, fulfilling 
their destiny and were, in 
that fulfillment, supremely 
happy. After tens of thou- 
sands of cycles of time they 
were doing a job for their 
adored, their revered and 
beloved MASTERS. 

That was a stunning shock; 
but it was eclipsed by an- 
other. 

CCT am sorry. Master Hil- 

•*ton,” Laro’s tremendous 
bass voice boomed out, “that 
it has taken us so long to 



learn your Masters’ language 
as it now is. Since you left 
us you have changed it radi- 
cally ; while we, of course, 
have not changed it at all.” 
“I’m sorry, but you’re mis- 
taken,” Hilton said. “We are 
merely visitors. We have nev- 
er been here before; nor, as 
far as we know, were any of 
our ancestors ever here.” 
“You need not test us. Mas- 
ter. We have kept your trust. 
Everything has been kept, 
changelessly the same, await- 
ing your return as you or- 
dered so long ago.” 

“Can you read my mind?” 
Hilton demanded. 

“Of course; but Omans can 
not read in Masters’ minds 
anything except what Mas- 
ters want Omans to read.” 
“Omans?” Harkins asked. 
“Where did you Omans and 
your masters come from? 
Originally?” 

“As you know, Master, the 
Masters came originally from 
Arth. They populated Ardu, 
where we Omans were devel- 
oped. When the Stretts drove 
us from Ardu, we all came to 
Ardry, which was your home 
world until you left it in our 
care. We keep also this, your 
half of the Fuel World, in 
trust for you.” 

“Listen, Jarve!” Harkins 
said, tensely. “Oman-human. 
Arth-Earth. Ardu-Earth Two. 
Ardry-Earth Three. You 
can’t laugh them off... but 
there never was an Atlantis!” 
“This is getting no better

fast. Wc need a full staff 
meeting. You, too, Sawtelle, 
and your best man. We need 
all the brains the Perseus can 
muster.” 

“You’re right. But first, get 
those naked women out of 
here. It’s bad enough, having 
women aboard at all, but 
this. .my men are spacemen, 
mister.” 

Laro spoke up. “If it is the 
Masters’ pleasure to keep on 
testing us, so be it. We have 
forgotten nothing. A dwell- 
ing awaits each Master, in 
which each will be served by 
Omans who will know the 
Master’s desires without be- 
ing told. Every desire. While 
we Omans have no biological 
urges, we are of course high- 
ly skilled in relieving ten- 
sions and derive as much 
pleasure from that service as 
from any other.” 

Sawtelle broke the silence 
that followed. “Well, for the 
men — ” He hesitated. “Espe- 
cially on the ground. .well, 
talking in mixed company, 
you know, but I think. .” 

“Think nothing of the 
mixed company, Captain Saw- 
telle,” Sandra said. “We wom- 
en are scientists, not shrink- 
ing violets. We are accus- 
tomed to discussing the facts 
of life just as frankly as any 
other facts.” 

Sawtelle jerked a thumb at 
Hilton, who followed him out 
into the corridor. “I have 
been a Navy mule,” he said. 
“I admit now that I’m out- 



maneuvered, out-manned, and 
out-gunned.” 

“I’m just as baffled — at 
present — as you are, sir. But 
my training has been aimed 
specifically at the unexpect- 
ed, while yours has not.” 
“That’s letting me down 
easy, Jarve.” Sawtelle smiled 
— the first time the startled 
Hilton had known that the 
hard, tough old spacehound 
could smile. “What I wanted 
to say is, lead on. I’ll follow 
you through force-field and 
space-warps.” 

“Thanks, skipper. And by 
the way, I erased that record 
yesterday.” The two gripped 
hands ; and there came into 
being a relationship that was 
to become a lifelong friend- 
ship. 

44YJ77E will start for Ardry 
*Y immediately,” Hilton 
said. “How do we make that 
jump without charts, Laro?” 
“Very easily, Master. Kedo, 
as Master Captain Sawtelle’s 
Oman, will give the orders. 
Nito will serve Master Snow- 
den and supply the knowledge 
he says he has forgotten.” 
“Okay. We’ll go up to the 
control room and get started.” 
And in the control room, 
Kedo’s voice rasped into the 
captain’s microphone. “Atten- 
tion, all personnel ! Master 
Captain Sawtelle orders take- 
off in two minutes. The 
count-down will begin at five 
seconds. Five ! Four ! Three ! 
Two! One! Lift!”

Nito, not Snowden, handled 
the controls. As perfectly as 
the human pilot had ever done 
it, at the top of his finest 
form, he picked the immense 
spaceship up and slipped it 
silkily into subspace. 

“Well, I’ll be a. Snow- 
den gasped. “That's a better 
job than I ever did!" 

“Not at all, Master, as you 
know," Nito said. “It was you 
who did this. I merely per- 
formed the labor." 

A few minutes later, in the 
main lounge, Navy and BuSci 
personnel were mingling as 
they had never done before. 
Whatever had caused this re- 
laxation of t e n s i o n — the 
friendship of captain and di- 
rector? The position in which 
they all were? Or what? — 
they all began to get acquaint- 
ed with each other. 

“Silence, please, and be 
seated," Hilton said. “While 
this is not exactly a formal 
meeting, it will be recorded 
for future reference. First, I 
will ask Laro a question. 
Were books or records left 
on Ardry by the race you call 
the Masters?” 

“You know there are, Mas- 
ter. They are exactly as you 
left them. Undisturbed for 
over two hundred seventy-one 
thousand years." 

•“Therefore we will not 
question the Omans. We do 
not know what questions to 
ask. We have seen many 
things hitherto thought im- 
possible. Hence, we must dis- 



card all preconceived opinions 
which conflict with facts. I 
will mention a few of the 
problems we face." 

“The Omans. The Masters. 
The upgrading of the arma- 
ment of the Perseus to Oman 
standards. The concentration 
of uranexite. What is that 
concentrate? How is it used? 
Total conversion — how is it 
accomplished? The skeletons 
— what are they and how are 
they controlled? Their ability 
to drain power. Who or what 
is back of them? Why a dead- 
lock that has lasted over a 
quarter of a million years? 
How much danger are we and 
the Perseus actually in? How 
much danger is Terra in, be- 
cause of our presence here? 
There are many other ques- 
tions." 

“Sandra and I will not take 
part. Nor will three others; 
de Vaux, Eisenstein, and 
Blake. You have more im- 
portant work to do." 

“What can that be?" asked 
Rebecca. “Of what possible 
use can a mathematician, a 
theoretician and a theoretical 
astronomer be in such a situ- 
ation as this?" 

“You can think powerfully 
in abstract terms, unhampered 
by Terran facts and laws 
which we now know are neith- 
er facts nor laws. I cannot 
even categorize the problems 
we face. Perhaps you three 
will be able to. You will lis- 
ten, then consult, then tell me 
how to pick the teams to do 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



27 




the work. A more important 
job for you is this : Any prob- 
lem, to be solved, must be 
stated clearly; and we don’t 
know even what our basic 
problem is. I want something 
by the use of which I can 
break this thing open. Get it 
for me.” 

R EBECCA and de Vaux 
merely smiled and nod- 
ded, but Teddy Blake said 
happily, “I was beginning to 
feel like a fifth wheel on this 
project, but that’s something 
I can really stick my teeth 
into.” 

“Huh? How?” Karns de- 
manded. “He didn’t give you 
one single thing to go on ; 
just compounded the Confu- 
sion.” 

Hilton spoke before Teddy 
could. “That’s their dish, 
Bill. If I had any data I’d 
work it myself. You first, 
Captain Sawtelle.” 

That conference was a very 
long one indeed. There were 
almost as many conclusions 
and recommendations as there 
were speakers. And through 
it all Hilton and Sandra lis- 
tened. They weighed and test- 
ed and analyzed and made 
copious notes ; in shorthand 
and in the more esoteric 
characters of symbolic logic. 
And at its end: 

“I’m just about pooped, 
Sandy. How about you?” 
“You and me both, boss. See 
you in the morning.” 

But she didn’t. It was four 



o’clock in the afternoon when 
they met again. 

“We made up one of the 
teams, Sandy,” he said, with 
surprising diffidence. “I 
know we were going to do it 
together, but I got a hunch 
on the first team. A kind of 
a weirdie, but the brains 
checked me on it.” He placed 
a card on her desk. “Don’t 
blow your top until after 
you’ve studied it.” 

“W h y, I won’t, of 
course...” Her voice died 
away. “Maybe you’d better 
cancel that ‘of course’...” 
She studied, and when she 
spoke again she was exerting 
self-control. “A chemist, a 
planetographer, a theoreti- 
cian, two sociologists, a psy- 
chologist and a radiationist. 
And six of the seven are three 
pairs of sweeties. What kind 
of a line-up is that to solve 
a problem in physics ?” 

“It isn’t in any physics we 
know. I said think!” 

“Oh,” she said, then again 
“Oh,” and “Oh,” and “Oh.” 
Four entirely different tones. 
“I see. .maybe. You’re match- 
ing minds, not specialties; 
and supplementing?” 

“I knew you were smart. 
Buy it?” 

“It’s weird, all right, but 
I’ll buy it — for a trial run, 
anyway. But I’d hate like sin 
to have to sell any part of it 
to the Board. But of course 
we’re — I mean you’re respon- 
sible only to yourself.” 

“Keep it ‘we’, Sandy.. You’re 



28

as important to thi6 project 
as I am. But before we tackle 
the second team, what’s your 
thought on Bemadine and 
Hermione? Separate or to- 
gether?” 

“Separate, I’d say. They’re 
identical physically, and so 
nearly so mentally that one 
of them would be just as good 
on a team as both of them. 
More and better work on dif- 
ferent teams.” 

“My thought exactly.” And 
so it went, hour after hour. 

The teams were selected 
and meetings were held. 

T HE Perseus reached Ar- 
dry, which was very much 
like Terra. There were con- 
tinents, oceans, ice-caps, 
lakes, rivers, mountains and 
plains, forests and prairies. 
The ship landed on the space- 
field of Omlu, the City of the 
Masters, and Sawtelle called 
Hilton into his cabin. The 
Omans Laro and Kedo went 
along, of course. 

“Nobody knows how it 
leaked...” Sawtelle began. 

“No secrets around here,” 
Hilton grinned. “Omans, you 
know.” 

“I suppose so. Anyway, ev- 
ery man aboard is all hyped 
up about living aground — es- 
pecially with a harem. But be- 
fore I grant liberty, suppose 
there’s any VD around here 
that our prophylactics can’t 
handle?” 

“As you know, Masters,” 
Laro replied for Hilton be- 

M ASTERS OF SPACE 



fore the latter could open his 
mouth, “no disease, venereal 
or other, is allowed to exist 
on Ardry. No prophylaxis is 
either necessary or desir- 
able.” 

“That ought to hold you 
for a while. Skipper.” Hilton 
smiled at the flabbergasted 
captain and went back to the 
lounge. 

“Everybody going ashore?” 

n p 

“Yes.” Karns said. “Unani- 
mous vote for the first time.” 

“Who wouldn’t?” Sandra 
asked. “I’m fed up with living 
like a sardine. I will scream 
for joy the minute I get into 
a real room.” 

“Cars” were waiting, in a 
stopping-and-starting line. 
Three-wheel jobs. All were 
empty. No drivers, no steer- 
ing-wheels, no instruments or 
push-b u 1 1 o n s. When the 
whole line moved ahead as 
one vehicle there was no 
noise, no gas, no blast. 

An Oman helped a Master 
carefully into the rear seat 
of his car, leaped into the 
front seat and the car sped 
quietly away. The whole line 
of empty cars, acting in per- 
fect synchronization, shot 
forward one space and 
stopped. 

“This is your car, Master,” 
Laro said, and made a pro- 
duction out of getting Hilton 
into the vehicle undamaged. 

Hilton’s plan had been 
beautifully simple. All the 
teams were to meet at the 

29 




Hall of Records. The lin- 
guists and their Omans would 
study the records and pass 
them out. Specialty after 
specialty would be unveiled 
and teams would work on 
them. He and Sandy would 
sit in the office and analyze 
and synthesize and correlate. 
It was a very nice plan. 

It was a very nice office, 
too. It contained every item 
of equipment that either San- 
dra or Hilton had ever 
worked with — it was a big of- 
fice — and a great many that 
neither of them had ever 
heard of. It had a full staff of 
Omans, all eager to work. 

Hilton and Sandra sat in 
that magnificent office for 
three hours, and no reports 
came in. Nothing happened at 
all. 

“This gives me the howling 
howpers !" Hilton growled. 
“Why haven't I got brains 
enough to be on one of those 
teams?" 

“I could shed a tear for 
you, you big dope, but I 
won't," Sandra retorted. 
“What do you want to be, be- 
sides the brain and the king- 
pin and the balance-wheel 
and the spark-plug of the out- 
fit? Do you want to do 
everything yourself?" 

“Well, I don't want to go 
completely nuts, and that’s 
all I'm doing at the moment !" 
The argument might have be- 
come acrimonious, but it was 
interrupted by a call from 
Karns. 



“Can you come out here, 
Jarve? We've struck a knot." 

“ 'Smatter? Trouble with 
the Omans?" Hilton snapped. 

“Not exactly. Just non-co- 
operation — squared. We can't 
even get started. I'd like to 
have you two come out here 
and see if you can do any- 
thing. I'm not trying rough 
stuff, because I know it 
wouldn’t work." 

“Coming' up, Bill," and 
Hilton and Sandra, followed 
by Laro and Sora, dashed out 
to their cars. 

T HE Hall of Records was 
a long, wide, low, window- 
less, very massive structure, 
built of a metal that looked 
like stainless steel. Kept 
highly polished, the vast ex- 
panse of seamless and joint- 
less metal was mirror-bright. 
The one great door was open, 
and just inside it were the 
scientists and their Omans. 

“Brief me, Bill," Hilton 
said. 

“No lights. They won't turn 
'em on and we can't. Can't 
find either lights or any pos- 
sible kind of switches." 

“Turn on the lights, Laro," 
Hilton said. 

“You know that I cannot 
do that, Master. It is forbid- 
den for any Oman to have 
anything to do with the illu- 
mination of this solemn and 
revered place." 

“Then show me how to do 
it." 

“That would be just as bad, 



30 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




Master,” the Oman said 
proudly. "I will not fail any 
test you can devise !” 

“Okay. All you Omans go 
back to the ship and bring 
over fifteen or twenty lights 
— the tripod jobs. Scat!” 
They “scatted” and Hilton 
went on, “No use asking 
questions if you don’t know 
what questions to ask. Let’s 
see if we can cook up some- 
thing. Lane — Kathy — what 
has Biology got to say?” 

Dr. Lane Saunders and Dr. 
Kathryn Cook — the latter a 
willowy brown-eyed blonde — 
conferred briefly. Then Saun- 
ders spoke, running both 
hands through his unruly 
shock of fiery red hair. “So 
far, the best we can do is a 
more-or-less educated guess. 
They’re atomic-powered, to- 
tal-conversion androids. 
Their pseudo-flesh is com- 
posed mainly of silicon and 
fluorine. We don’t know the 
formula yet, but it is as much 
more stable than our teflon 
as teflon is than corn-meal 
mush. As to the brains, no 
data. Bones are super-stain- 
less steel. Teeth, harder than 
diamond, but won’t break. 
Food, uranexite or its con- 
centrated derivative, inter- 
changeably. Storage reserve, 
indefinite. Laro and Sora 
won’t have to eat again for 
at least twenty-five years. .” 
The group gasped as one, 
but Saunders went on: “They 
can eat and drink and breathe 
and so on, but only because 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



the original Masters wanted 
them to. Non-f unctional. 
Skins and subcutaneous lay- 
ers are soft, for the same rea- 
son. That’s about it, up to 
now.” 

“Thanks, Lane. Hark, is it 
reasonable to believe that any 
culture whatever could run 
for a quarter of a million 
years without changing one 
word of its language or one 
iota of its behavior?” 

“Reasonable or not, it seems 
to have happened.” 

“Now for Psychology. 
Alex?” 

“It seems starkly incredi- 
ble, but it seems to be true. 
If it is, their minds were sub- 
jected to a conditioning no 
Terran has ever imagined — 
an unyielding fixation.” 

“They can’t be swayed, 
then, by reason or logic?” 
Hilton paused invitingly. 

“Or anything else,” Kin- 
caid said, flatly. “If we’re 
right they can’t be swayed, 
period.” 

“I was afraid of that. Well, 
that’s all the questions I 
know how to ask. Any contri- 
butions to this symposium?” 

A FTER a short silence de 
Vaux said, “I suppose 
you realize that the first half 
of the problem you posed us 
has now solved itself?” 

“Why, no. No, you’re ’way 
ahead of me.” 

“There is a basic problem 
and it can now be clearly 
stated,” Rebecca said. “Prob- 



31 




lem: To determine a method 
of securing full cooperation 
from the Omans. The first 
step in the solution of this 
problem is to find the most 
appropriate operator. Ted- 
dy?" 

"I have an operator — of 
sorts," Theodora said. "I’ve 
been hoping one of us could 
find a better." 

44 What is it?" Hilton de- 
manded. 

"The word ‘until’." 

“Tec 1 ’'', you’re a sweet- 
heart!” Hilton exclaimed. 

"How can ‘until’ be a math- 
emati '.al oj cor?" Sandra 
asked. 

"Easi Hilton was al- 
ready deep in thought. ‘‘This 
hard conditioning was to last 
only until the Masters re- 
turned. Then they’d break it. 
So all we have to do is figure 
out how a Master would do 
it." 

‘‘That’s all ” Kincaid said, 
meaningly. 

Hilton pondered. Then, 
"Listen, all of you. I may 
have to try a colossal job of 
bluffing. ." 

‘‘Just what would you call 
‘colossal’ after what you did 
to the Navy?" Karns asked. 

"That was a sure thing. 
This isn’t. You see, to find out 
whether Laro is really an im- 
movable object, I’ve got to 
make like an irresistible 
force, which I ain’t. I don’t 
know what I’m going to do; 
I’ll have to roll it as I go 
along. So all of you keep on 



your toes and back any play 
I make. Here they come." 

The Omans came in and 
Hilton faced Laro, eyes to 
eyes. "Laro," he said, "you re- 
fused to obey my direct or- 
der. Your reasoning seems to 
be that, whether the Masters 
wish it or not, you Omans 
will block any changes what- 
ever in the status quo 
throughout all time to come. 
In other words, you deny the 
fact that Masters are in fact 
your Masters." 

"But that is not exactly it, 
Master. The Masters..." 

"That is it. Exactly it. 
Either you are the Master 
here or you are not. That is 
a point to which your two- 
value logic can be strictly a p-y 
plied. You are' wilfully neg- 
lecting the word ‘until’. This 
stasis was to exist only until 
the Masters returned. Are we 
Masters? Have we returned? 
Note well: Upon that one 
word ‘until’ may depend the 
length of time your Oman 
race will continue to exist." 

The Omans flinched; the 
humans gasped. 

"But more of that later," 
Hilton went on, unmoved. 
"Your ancient Masters, being 
short-lived like us, changed 
materially with time, did they 
not? And you changed with 
them?" 

"But we did not change 
ourselves, Master. The Mas- 
ters. ." 

"You did change your- 
selves. The Masters changed 



32 



by Edward E. Smith A E. Everett Evans 




only the prototype brain. 
They ordered you to change 
yourselves and you obeyed 
their orders. We order you to 
change and you refuse to 
obey our orders. We have 
changed greatly from our an- 
cestors. Right?” 

"That is right, Master.” 
"We are stronger physical- 
ly, more alert and more vig- 
orous mentally, with a keen- 
er, sharper outlook on life?” 
"You are, Master.” 

44 f T l HAT is because our an- 
cestors decided to do 
without Omans. We do our 
own work and enjoy it. Your 
Masters died of futility and 
boredom. What I would like 
to do, Laro, is take you to the 
creche and put your disobe- 
dient brain back into the 
matrix. However, the decision 
is not mine alone to make. 
How about it, fellows and 
girls? Would you rather have 
alleged servants who won’t do 
anything you tell them to or 
no servants at all?” 

"As semantician, I pro- 
test !” Sandra backed his play. 
"That is the most viciously 
loaded question I ever heard 
— it can’t be answered except 
in the wrong way!” 

"Okay, I’l-l make it seman- 
tically sound. I think we’d 
better scrap this whole Oman 
race and start over and I 
want a vote that way /” 

"You won’t get it !” and 
everybody began to yell. 
Hilton restored order and 



swung on Laro, his attitude 
stiff, hostile and reserved. 
"Since it is clear that no 
unanimous decision is to be 
expected at this time I will 
take no action at this time. 
Think over, very carefully, 
what I have said, for as far 
as I am concerned, this world 
has no place for Omans who 
will not obey orders. As soon 
as I convince my staff of the 
fact, I shall act as follows: I 
shall give you an order and if 
you do not obey it blast your 
head to a cinder. I shall then 
give the same order to an- 
other Oman and blast him. 
This process will continue 
until: First, I find an obedi- 
ent Oman. Second, I run out 
of blasters. Third, the planet 
runs out of Omans. Now take 
these lights into the first 
room of records — that one 
over there.” He pointed, and 
no Oman, and only four hu- 
mans, realized that he had 
made the Omans telegraph 
their destination so that he 
could point it out to them! 

Inside the room Hilton 
asked caustically of Laro: 
"The Masters didn’t lift those 
heavy chests down them- 
selves, did they?” 

"Oh, no, Master, we did 
that.” 

"Do it, then. Number One 
firsts, yes, that one... open 
it and start playing the rec- 
ords in order.” 

The records were not tapes 
or flats or reels, but were 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



33 




spools of intricately-braided 
wire. The players were pro- 
jectors of full-color, hi-fi 
sound, tri-di pictures. 

Hilton canceled all moves 
aground and issued orders 
that no Oman was to be al- 
lowed aboard ship, then 
looked and listened with his 
staff. 

The first chest contained 
only introductory and ele- 
mentary stuff ; but it was so 
interesting that the humans 
stayed overtime to finish it. 
Then they went back to the 
ship; and in the main lounge 
Hilton practically collapsed 
onto a davenport. He took out 
a cigarette and stared in sur- 
prise at his hand, which was 
shaking. 

“I think I could use a 
drink,” he remarked. 

“What, before supper?” 
Karns marveled. Then, “Hey, 
Wally! Rush a flagon of 
avignognac — Arnaud Freres 
— for the boss and everything 
else for the rest of us. Chop- 
chop but quick!” 

A hectic half-hour fol- 
lowed. Then, “Okay, boys and 
girls, I love you, too, but let’s 
cut out the slurp and sloosh, 
get some supper and log us 
some sack time. I’m just about 
pooped. Sorry I had to queer 
the private-residence deal, 
Sandy, you poor little sar- 
dine. But you know how it 
is.” 

Sandra grimaced. “Uh-huh. 
I can take it a while longer 
if you can.” 



A FTER breakfast next 
morning, the staff met in 
the lounge. As usual, Hilton 
and Sandra were the first to 
arrive. 

“Hi, boss,” she greeted him. 
“How do you feel?” 

“Fine. I could whip a wild- 
cat and give her the first two 
scratches. I was a bit beat up 
last night, though.” 

“I’ll say... but what I sim- 
ply can’t get over is the way 
you underplayed the climax. 
‘Third, the planet runs out of 
Omans’. Just like that — no 
emphasis at all. Wow! It had 
the impact of a delayed-ac- 
tion atomic bomb. It put 
goose-bumps all over me. But 
just s’pose they’d missed it?” 
“No fear. They’re smart. I 
had to play it as though the 
whole Oman race is no more 
important than a cigarette 
butt. The great big question, 
though, is whether I put it 
across or not.” 

At that point a dozen peo- 
ple came in, all talking about 
the same subject. 

“Hi, Jarve,” Karns said. “I 
still say you ought to take up 
poker as a life work. Tiny, 
let’s you and him sit down 
now and play a few hands.” 
“Mais non!” de Vaux shook 
his head violently, shrugged 
his shoulders and threw both 
arms wide. “By the sacred 
name of a small blue cabbage, 
not me!” 

Karns laughed. “How did 
you have the guts to state so 
many things as facts? If you’d 



34

guessed wrong just once — ” 

“I didn't.” Hilton grinned. 
“Think back, Bill. The only 
thing I said as a fact was that 
we as a race are better then 
the Masters were, and that is 
obvious. Everything else was 
implication, logic, and bluff.” 
“That's right, at that. And 
they were neurotic and de- 
cadent. No question about 
that.” 

“But listen, boss.” This was 
Stella Wing. “About this 
mind-reading business. If 
Laro could read your mind, 
he’d know you were bluffing 
and..’ Oh, that ‘Omans can 
read only what Masters wish 
Omans to read', eh? But d'you 
think that applies to us?” 

“I'm sure it does, and I was 
thinking some pretty savage 
thoughts. And I want to cau- 
tion all of you : whenever 

you're near any Oman, start 
thinking that you're begin- 
ning to agree with me that 
they’re useless to us, and let 
them know it. Now get out 
on the job, all of you. Scat!” 
“Just a minute,” Poynter 
said. “We're going to have to 
keep on using the Omans and 
their cars, aren't we?” 

“Of course. Just be superi- 
or and distant. They're on 
probation — we haven't decid- 
ed yet what to do about them. 
Since that happens to be 
true, it'll be easy.” 

H ILTON and Sandra went 
to their tiny office. There 
wasn’t room to pace the floor, 



but Hilton tried to pace it 
anyway. 

“Now don't say again that 
you want to do something,” 
Sandra said, brightly. “Look 
what happened when you said 
that yesterday.” 

“I've got a job, but I don’t 
know enough to do it. The 
creche — there's probably only 
one on the planet. So I want 
you to help me think. The 
Masters were very sensitive 
to radiation. Right?” 

“Right. That city on Fuel 
Bin was kept deconned to 
zero, just in case some Mas- 
ter wanted to visit it.” 

“And the Masters had to 
work in the creche whenever 
anything really new had to 
be put into the prototype 
brain.” 

“I’d say so, yes.” 

“So they had armor. Prob- 
ably as much better than our 
radiation suits as the rest of 
their stuff is. Now. Did they 
or did they not have thought 
screens?” 

“Ouch! You think of the 
damnedest things, chief.” She 
caught her lower lip between 
her teeth and concentrated. 
“...I don't know. There are 
at least fifty vectors, all 
pointing in different direc- 
tions.” 

“I know it. The key one in 
my opinion is that the Mas- 
ters gave 'em both telepathy 
and speech.” 

“I considered that and 
weighted it. Even so, the 
probability is only about 



MASTERS OF SPACE

point sixty-five. Can you take 
that much of a chance?” 

“Yes. I can make one or 
two mistakes. Next, about 
finding that creche. Any spot 
of radiation on the planet 
would be it, but the search 
might take...” 

“Hold on. They’d have it 
heavily shielded — there’ll be 
no leakage at all. Laro will 
have to take you.” 

“That’s right. Want to come 
along? Nothing much will 
happen here today.” 

“Uh-uh, not me.” Sandra 
shivered in distaste. “I never 
want to see brains and livers 
and things swimming around 
in nutrient solution if I can 
help it.” 

“Okay. It’s all yours. I’ll be 
back sometime,” and Hilton 
went out onto the dock, 
where the dejected Laro was 
waiting for him. 

“Hi, Laro. Get the car and 
take me to the Hall of Rec- 
ords.” The android bright- 
ened up immediately and 
hurried to obey. 

At the Hall, Hilton’s first 
care was to see how the work 
was going on. Eight of the 
huge rooms were now open 
and brightly lighted — operat- 
ing the lamps had been one 
of the first items on the first 
spool of instructions — with a 
cold, pure-white, sourceless 
light. 

E VERY team had found its 
objective and was work- 
ing on it. Some of them were 



doing nicely, but the First 
Team could not even get 
started. Its primary record 
would advance a fraction of 
an inch and stop ; while 
O m a n s and humans sought 
out other records and other 
projectors in an attempt to 
elucidate some concept that 
simply could not be translat- 
ed into any words or symbols 
known to Terran science. At 
the moment there were seven- 
teen of those peculiar — pro- 
jectors? Viewers? Playbacks 
— in use, and all of them were 
stopped. 

“You know what we’ve got 
to do Jarve?” Karns, the 
team captain, exploded. “Go 
back to being college fresh- 
men — or maybe grade school 
or kindergarten, we don’t 
know yet — and learn a whole 
new system of mathematics 
before we can even begin to 
touch this stuff!” 

“And you’re bellyaching 
about that?” Hilton marveled. 
“I wish I could join you. 
That’d be fun.” Then, as 
Karns started a snappy re- 
joiner — 

“But I got troubles of ray 
own,” he added hastily. 
“ ’Bye, now,” and beat a re- 
joinder — 

Out in the hall again, Hil- 
ton took his chance. After all, 
the odds were about two to 
one that he would win. 

“I want a couple of things, 
Laro. First, a thought screen.” 

He won ! 

“Very well. Master. They 



36 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




are in a distant roonti, Depart- 
ment Four Six Nine. Will 
you wait here on this cush- 
ioned bench, Master ?” 

“No, we don’t like to rest 
too much. I’ll go with you.” 
Then, walking along, he went 
on, thoughtfully. “I’ve been 
thinking since last night, 
Laro. There are tremen- 
dous advantages in having 
Omans ...” 

“I am very glad you think 
so, Master. I want to serve 
you. It is my greatest need.’’ 

“ . if they could be kept 
from smothering us to death. 
Thus, if our ancestors had 
kept their Omans, I would 
have known all about life on 
this world and about this Hall 
of Records, instead of having 
the fragmentary, confusing, 
and sometimes false informa- 
tion I now have... oh, we’re 
here?” 



L ARO had stopped and was 
opening a door. He stood 
aside. Hilton went in, touched 
with one finger a crystalline 
cube set conveniently into a 
wall, gave a mental command, 
and the lights went on. 

Laro opened a cabinet and 
took out a disk about the size 
of a dime, pendant from a 
neck-chain. While Hilton had 
not known what to expect, he 
certainly had not expected 
anything as simple as that. 
Nevertheless, he kept his face 
straight and his thoughts un- 
moved as Laro hung the tiny 



thing around his neck and ad- 
justed the chain to a loose fit. 

“Thanks, Laro.”- Hilton re- 
moved it and put it into his 
pocket. “It won’t work from 
there, will it?” 

“No, Master. To function, 
it must be within eighteen 
inches of the brain. The sec- 
ond thing, Master?” 

“A radiation-p roof suit. 
Then you will please take me 
to the creche.” 

The android almost missed 
a step, but said nothing. 

The radiation-proof suit — 
how glad Hilton was that he 
had not called it “armor”! — 
was as much of a surprise as 
the thought-screen generator 
had been. It was a coverall, 
made of something that 
looked like thin plastic, 
weighing less than one pound. 
It had one sealed box, about 
the size and weight of a 
cigarette case. No wires or 
apparatus could be seen. Air 
entered through two filters, 
one at each heel, flowed up- 
ward — for no reason at all 
that Hilton could see — and 
out through a filter above the 
top of his head. The suit nei- 
ther flopped nor clung, but 
stood out, comfortably out of 
the way, all by itself. 

Hilton, just barely, accept- 
ed the suit, too, without 
showing surprise. 

The creche, it turned out, 
while not in the city of Omlu 
itself, was not too far out to 
reach easily by car. 

En route, Laro said — stiff- 



MASTERS OF SPACE

Iy? Tentatively? Hilton could 
not fit an adverb to the 
tone — “Master, have you then 
decided to destroy me? That 
is of course your right.” 

“Not this time, at least.” 
Laro drew an entirely human 
breath of relief and Hilton 
went on: “I don’t want to de-_ 
stroy you at all, and won’t, 
unless I have to. But, some 
way or other, my silifcon- 
fluoride friend, you are either 
going to learn how to cooper- 
ate or you won’t last much 
longer.” 

“But, Master, that is ex- 
actly. .” 

“Oh, hell! Do we have to 
go pver that again?” At the 
blaze of frustrated fury in 
Hilton’s mind Laro flinched 
away. “If you can’t talk sense 
keep still.” 

I N half an hour the car 
stopped in front of a small 
building which looked some- 
thing like a subway kiosk — 
except for the door, which, 
built of steel-reinforced lead, 
swung on a piano hinge hav- 
ing a pin a good eight inches 
in diameter. Laro opened that 
door. They went in. As the 
tremendously massive portal 
clanged shut, lights flashed 
on. * 

Hilton glanced at his tell- 
tales, one inside, one outside, 
his suit. Both showed zero. 

Down twenty steps, anoth- 
er door. Twenty more; an- 
other. And a fourth. Hilton’s 
inside meter still read zero. 



The outside one was begin- 
ning to climb. 

Into an elevator and 
straight down for what must 
have been four or five hun- 
dred feet. Another door. Hil- 
ton went through this final 
barrier gingerly, eyes nailed 
to his gauges. The outside 
needle was high in the red,, 
almost against the pin,* but 
the inside one still sat reas- 
suringly on zero. 

He stared at the android. 
“How can any possible brain 
take so much of this stuff 
without damage?” 

“It does not reach the 
brain, Master. We convert it. 
Each minute of this is what 
you would call a ‘good, square 
meal’.” 

“I see. .dimly. You can eat 
energy, or drink it, or soak it 
up through your skins. How- 
ever it comes, it’s all duck 
soup for you.” 

“Yes, Master.” 

Hilton glanced ahead, to- 
ward the far end of the im- 
mensely long, comparatively 
narrow, room. It was, purely 
and simply, an assembly line; 
and fully automated in opera- 
tion. 1 

“You are replacing the 
Omans destroyed in the bat- 
tle with the skeletons?” 

“Yes, Master.” 

Hilton covered the first 
half of the line at a fast walk. 
He was not particularly in- 
terested in the fabrication of 
super-stainless-s t e e 1 skefe- 
tons, nor in the installation

and connection >£ atomic en- 
gines, converters and so on. 

He was more interested in 
the synthetic fluoro-silicon 
flesh, and paused long enough 
to get a general idea of its 
growth and application. He 
was very much interested in 
how such human-looking skin 
could act as both absorber 
and converter, but he could 
see nothing helpful. 

“An application, I suppose, 
of the same principle used in 
this radiation suit.” 

“Yes, Master/' 

A T the end of the line he 
stopped. A brain, in place 
and connected to millions of 
infinitely fine wire nerves, 
but not yet surrounded by a 
skull, was being educated. 
Scanners — multitudes of in- 
comprehensibly complex ma- 
chines — most of them were 
doing nothing, apparently; 
but such beams would have to 
be invisibly, microscopically 
fine. But a bare brain, in such 
a hot environment as this . 

He looked down at his 
gauges. Both read zero. 

“Fields of force, Master,” 
Laro said. 

“But, damn it, this suit it- 
self would re-radiate...” 

“The suit is self-decontami- 
nating, Master.” 

Hilton was appalled. “With 
such stuff as that, and the 
plastic shield besides, why all 
the depth and all that solid 
lead?” 

“The Masters’ orders, Mas- 



ter. Machines can, and occa- 
sionally do, fail. So might, 
conceivably, the plastic.” 

“And that structure over 
there contains the original 
brain, from which all the 
copies are made.” 

“Yes, Master. We call it the 
'Guide'.” 

“And you can't touch the 
Guide. Not even if it means 
total destruction, none of you 
can touch it.” 

“That is the case. Master.” 
“Okay. Back to the car and 
back to the Perseus .” 

At the car Hilton took off 
the suit and hung the 
thought-screen generator 
around his neck; and in the 
car, for twenty five solid min- 
utes, he sat still and thought. 

His bluff had worked, up 
to a point. A good, far point, 
but not quite far enough. Laro 
had stopped that “as you al- 
ready know” stuff. He was 
eager to go as far in coopera- 
tion as he possibly could . 
but he couldn't go far enough 
but there had to be a way. 

Hilton considered way af- 
ter way. Way after unwork- 
able, useless way. Until final- 
ly he worked out one that 
might — just possibly might — 
work. 

“Laro, I know that you de- 
rive pleasure and satisfaction 
from serving me — in doing 
what I ought to be doing my- 
self. But has it ever occurred 
to you that that’s a hell of a 
way to treat a first-class, 
highly capable brain? To 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



39 




waste it on second-hand, copy- 
cat, carbon-copy stuff?” 

“Why, no, Master, it never 
did. Besides, anything else 
would be forbidden. .or 
would it?” 

“Stop somewhere. Park this 
heap. We’re too close to the 
ship; and besides, I want your 
full, undivided, concentrated 
attention. No, I don’t think 
originality was expressly for- 
bidden. It would have been, 
of Course, if the Masters had 
thought of it, but neither they 
nor you ever even considered 
the possibility of such a thing. 
Right?” 

“It may be... Yes, Master, 
you are right.” 

“Okay.” Hilton took off his 
necklace, the better to drive 
home the intensity and sin- 
cerity of his thought. “Now, 
suppose that you are not my 
slave and simple automatic 
relay station. Instead, we are 
fellow-students, working to- 
gether upon problems too dif- 
ficult for either of us to solve 
alone. Our minds, while in- 
dependent, are linked or in 
mesh. Each is helping and in- 
structing the other. Both are 
working at full power and un- 
der free rein at the explora- 
tion of brand-new vistas of 
thought — vistas and expanses 
which neither of us has ever 
previously. .” 

“Stop, Master, stop!** Laro 
covered both ears with his 
hands and pulled his mind 
away from Hilton’s. “You are 
overloading me l” 



“That is quite a load to as- 
similate all at once,” Hilton 
agreed. “To help you get used 
to it, stop calling me 'Master’. 
That’s an order. You may call 
me Jarve or Jarvis or Hilton 
or whatever, but no more 
Master.” 

“Very well, sir.” 

H ILTON laughed and 
slapped himself on the 
knee. “Okay, I’ll let you get 
away with that — at least for a 
while. And to get away from 
that slavish 'o’ ending on your 
name, I’ll call you 'Larry’. 
You like?” 

“I would like that immense- 
ly. .sir.” 

“Keep trying, Larry, you’ll 
make it yet!” Hilton leaned 
forward and walloped the 
android a tremendous blow on 
the knee. “Home, James!” 

The car shot forward and 
Hilton went on: “I don’t ex- 
pect even your brain to get 
the full value of this in any 
short space of time. So let it 
stew in its own juice for a 
week or two.” The car swept 
otit onto the dock and 
stopped. “So long, Larry.” 
“But. .can’t I come in 
with you... sir?” 

“No. You aren’t a copy-cat 
or a semaphore or a relay any 
longer. You’re a free-wheel- 
ing, wide-swinging, hard-hit- 
ting, independent entity — 
monarch of all you survey — 
captain of your soul and so 
on. I want you to devote the 
imponderable force of the in- 



40 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




tellect to that concept until 
you understand it thoroughly. 
Until you have developed a 
top-bracket lot of top-bracket 
stuff — originality, initiative, 
force, drive, and thrust. As 
soon as you really understand 
it, you’ll do something about 
it yourself, without being 
told. Go to it, chum.” 

In the ship, Hilton went di- 
rectly to Kincaid’s office. 
‘‘Alex, I want to ask you a 
thing that’s got a snapper on 
it.” Then, slowly and hesi- 
tantly : “It’s about Temple 

Bells. Has she... is she... 
well, does she remind you in 
any way of an iceberg?” Then, 
as the psychologist began to 
smile ; “And no, damn it, I 
don’t mean physically!” 

“I know you don’t.” Kin- 
caid’s smile was rueful, not at 
all what Hilton had thought 
it was going to be. “She does. 
Would it be helpful to know 
that I first asked, then or- 
dered her to trade places with 
me?” 

“It would, very. I know 
why she refused. You’re a 
damned good man, Alex.” 
“Thanks, Jarve. To answer 
the question you were going 
to ask next — no, I will not be 
at all perturbed or put out 
if you put her onto a job that 
some people might think 
should have been mine. What’s 
the job, and when?” 

“That’s the devil of it— I 
don’t know.” Hilton brought 
Kincaid up to date. “So you - 
see, it’ll have to develop, and 



God only knows what line it 
will take. My thought is that 
Temple and I should form a 
Committee of Two to watch 
it develop.” 

“That one I’ll buy, and I’ll 
look on with glee.” 

“Thanks, fellow.” Hilton 
went down to his office, stuck 
his big feet up onto his desk, 
settled back onto his spine, 
and buried himself in thought. 

Hours later he got up, 
shrugged, and went to bed 
without bothering to eat. 
Days passed. 

And weeks.

«T OOK,” said Stella Wing 
"to Beverly Bell. “Over 
there.” 

“I’ve seen it before. It’s 
simply disgusting.” 

“That’s a laugh.” Stella’s 
tawny-brown eyes twinkled. 
“You made your bombing 
runs on that target, too, my 
sweet, and didn’t score any 
higher than I did.” 

“I soon found out I didn’t 
want him — much too stiff and 
serious. Frank’s a lot more 
fun.” 

The staff had gathered in 
the lounge, as had become the 
custom, to spend an hour or 
so before bedtime in reading, 
conversation, dancing, light 
flirtation and even lighter 
drinking. Most of the girls, 
and many of the men, drank 
only soft drinks. Hilton took 
one drink per day of avig- 



MASTERS OF SPACE

nognac, a fine old brandy. So 
did de Vaux — the two usually 
making a ceremony of it. 

Across the room from Stella 
and Beverly, Temple Bells 
was looking up at Hilton and 
laughing. She took his elbow 
and, in the gesture now fa- 
miliar to all, pressed his arm 
quickly, but in no sense fur- 
tively, against her side. And 
he, equally openly, held her 
forearm for a moment in the 
full grasp of his hand. 

“And he isn't a pawer,” 
Stella said, thoughtfully. “He 
never touches any of the rest 
of us. She taught him to do 
that, damn her, without him 
ever knowing anything about 
it... and I wish I knew how 
she did it.” 

“That isn't pawing,” Bever- 
ly laughed lightly. “It’s sim- 
ply self-defense. If he didn’t 
fend her off, God knows what 
she’d do. I still say it’s dis- 
gusting. And the way she 
dances with him! She ought 
to be ashamed of herself. He 
ought to fire her.” 

“She’s never been caught 
outside the safety zone, and 
we’ve all been watching her 
like hawks. In fact, she’s the 
only one of us all who has 
never been alone with him for 
a minute. No, darling, she 
isn’t playing games. She’s 
playing for keeps, and she’s a 
mighty smooth worker.” 

“Huh!” Beverly emitted a 
semi-ladylike snort. “What’s 
so smooth about showing off 
man-hunger that way? Any of 

42 by E< 



us could do that — if we 
would.” 

“Miaouw, miaouw. Who do 
you think you’re kidding, 
Bev, you sanctimonious hypo- 
crite — me? She has staked out 
the biggest claim she could 
find. She’s posted notices all 
oyer it and is guarding it with 

"a pistol. Half your month’s 
salary gets you all of mine 
if she doesn’t walk him up 
the center aisle as soon as we 
get back to Earth. We can 
both learn a lot from that girl, 
darling. And I, for one, am 
going to.” 

“Uh-uh, she hasn’t got a 
thing I want,” Beverly 
laughed again, still lightly. 
Her friend’s barbed shafts had 
not wounded her. “And I’d 
much rather be thought a 
hypocrite, even a sanctimoni- 
ous one, than a ravening, slav- 
ering — I can’t think of the 
technical name for a female 
wolf, so — wolfess, running 
around with teeth and claws 
bared, looking for another 
kill.” 

“You do get results, I ad- 
mit.” Stella, too, was undis- 
turbed. “We don’t seem to 
convince each other, do we, 
in the matter of technique?” 

AT this point the Hilton- 
** Bells tete-a-tete was in- 
terrupted by Captain Saw- 
telle. “Got half an hour, 
Jarve?” he asked. “The com- 
manders, especially Elliott 
and Fenway, would like to 
talk to you.” ' 

vard E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




“Sure I have, Skipper. Be 
seeing you, Temple,” and the 
two men went to the captain's 
cabin; in which room, blue 
with smoke despite the best 
efforts of the ventilators, six 
full commanders were argu- 
ing heatedly. 

“Hi, men,” Hilton* greeted 
them. 

“Hi, Jarve,” from all six, 
and: “What'll you drink? 

Still making do with ginger 
ale?” asked Elliott (Engineer- 
mg). 

“That’ll be fine, Steve. 
Thanks. You having as much 
trouble as we are?” 

“More,” the engineer said, 
glumly. “Want to know what 
it reminds me of? A bunch of 
Australian bushmen stumbling 
onto a ramjet and trying to 
figure out how it works. And 
yet Sam here has got the 
sublime guts to claim that he 
understands all about their 
detectors — and that they 
aren’t anywhere nearly as 
good as ours are.” 

“And they aren't/” blazed 
Commander . Samuel Bryant 
(Electronics). “We’ve spent 
six solid weeks looking for 
something that simply is not 
there. All they’ve got is the 
prehistoric Whitworth system 
and that’s all it is. Nothing 
else. Detectors — hell ! I tell 
you I can see better by moon- 
light than the very best they 
can do. With everything 
they’ve got you couldn’t de- 
tect a woman in your own 
bed!”- 



“And this has been going on 
all night,” Fenway (Astroga- 
tion) said. “So the rest of us 
thought we’d ask you in to 
help us pound some sense into 
Sam’s thick, hard head.” 
Hilton frowned in thought 
while taking a couple of sips 
of* his drink. Then, suddenly i 
his face cleared. “Sorry to 
disappoint you, gentlemen, 
but — at any odds you care to 
name and in anything from 
split peas to C-notes — Sam’s 
right.” 

C OMMANDER Samuel 
Bryant gasped in surprise 
and the six other officers ex- 
ploded as one. When the clam- 
or had subsided enough for 
him to be heard, Hilton went 
on: “I’m very glad to get that 
datum, Sam. It ties in per- 
fectly with everything else I 
know about them.” 

“How do you figure that 
kind of twaddle ties in with 
anything?” Sawtelle demand- 
ed. 

“Strict maintenance of the 
status quo ” Hilton explained, 
flatly. “That’s all they’re in- 
terested in. You said yourself, 
Skipper, that it was a hell of 
a place to have a space-battle, 
practically in atmosphere. 
They never attack. They nev- 
er scout. They simply don’t 
care whether they’re attacked 
or not. If and when attacked, 
they put up just enough ships 
to handle whatever force has 
arrived. When the attacker 
has been repulsed, they don’t

chase him a foot. They build 
as many ships and Omans as 
were lost in the battle — no 
more and no less — and then 
go on about their regular busi- 
ness. The Masters owned that 
half of the fuel bin, so the 
Omans are keeping that half. 
They will keep on keeping it 
for ever and ever. Amen.” 

“But that's no way to fight 
a war!” Three or four men 
said this, or its equivalent, at 
once. 

“Don’t judge' them by hu- 
man standards. They aren’t 
even approximately human. 
Our personnel is not expend- 
able. Theirs is — just as ex- 
pendable as their materiel.” 

While the Navy men were 
not convinced, all were si- 
lenced except Sawtelle. “But 
suppose the Stretts had sent 
in a thousand more skeletons 
than they did?” he argued. 

“According to the concept 
you fellows just helped me 
develop, it wouldn’t have 
made any difference how 
many they sent,” Hilton re- 
plied, thoughtfully. “One or a 
thousand or a million, the 
Omans have — must h a v e — 
enough ships and inactivated 
Omans hidden away, both on 
Fuel World and on Ardry 
here, to maintain the balance.” 

“Oh, hell!” Elliott snapped. 
“If I helped you hatch out 
any such brainstorm as that , 
I’m going onto Tillinghast’s 
couch for a six-week overhaul 
—or have him put me into his 
padded cell.” 



“Now that's what I would 
call a thought,” Bryant be- 
gan. 

“Hold it, Sam,” Hilton in- 
terrupted. “You can test it 
easily enough, Steve. Just ask 
your Oman.” 

“Yeah — and have him say 
‘Why, of course, Master, but 
why do you keep on testing 
me this way?’ He’ll ask me 
that about four times more, 
the stubborn, single-tracked, 
brainless skunk, and I’ll really 
go nuts. Are you getting any- 
where trying to make a Chris- 
tian out of Laro?” 

“It’s too soon to really say, 
but I think so.” Hilton paused 
in thought. “He’s making 
progress, but I don’t know 
how much. The devil of it is 
that it’s up to him to make 
the next move ; I can’t. I 
haven’t the faintest idea 
whether it will take days yet 
or weeks.” 

44DUT not months or years, 
^you think ?” Sawtelle 
asked. 

“No. We think that — but 
say, speaking of psycholo- 
gists, is Tillinghast getting 
anywhere, Skipper? He’s the 
only one of your big wheels 
who isn’t in liaison with us.” 
“No. Nowhere at all,” Saw- 
telle said, and Bryant added: 
“I don’t think he ever will. 
He still thinks human psy- 
chology will apply if he ap- 
plies it hard enough. But what 
did you start to say about 
Laro?”

“We think the break is 
about due, and that if it 
doesn’t come within about 
thirty days it won’t come at 
all — we’ll have to back up and 
start all over again.” 

“I hope it does. We’re all 
pulling for you,” Sawtelle 
said. “Especially since Karns’ 
estimate is still years, and he 
won’t be pinned down to any 
estimate even in years. By the 
way, Jarve, I’ve pulled my 
team off of that conversion 
stuff.” 

“Oh?” Hilton raised his 
eyebrows. 

“Putting them at something 
they can do. The real reason 
is that Poindexter pulled 
himself and his crew off it at 
eighteen hours today.” 

“I see. I’ve heard that they 
weren't keeping up with our 
team.” 

“He says that there’s noth- 
ing to keep up with, and I’m 
inclined to agree with him.” 
The old spacehound’s voice 
took on a quarter-deck rasp. 
“It’s a combination of psi- 
onics, witchcraft and magic. 
None of it makes any kind of 
sense.” 

“The only trouble with that 
viewpoint is that, whatever 
the stuff may be, it works,” 
Hilton said, quietly. 

“But damn it, how can it 
work?” 

“I don’t know. I’m not 
qualified to be on that team. 
I can’t even understand their 
reports. However, I know two 
things. First, they’ll get it in 



time. Second, we BuSci peo- 
ple will stay here until they 
do. However, I’m still hope- 
ful of finding a shortcut 
through Laro. Anyway, with 
this detector thing settled, 
you’ll have plenty to do to 
keep all your boys out of mis- 
chief for the next few 
months.” 

“Yes, and I’m glad of it. 
We’ll install our electronics 
systems on a squadron of 
these Oman ships and get 
them into distant-warning 
formation out in deep space 
where they belong. Then 
we’ll at least know what is 
going on.” 

“That’s a smart idea. Skip- 
per. Go to it. Anything else 
before we hit our sacks?” 

“One more thing. Our 
psych, Tillinghast. He’s been 
talking to me and sending me 
memos, but today he gave me 
a formal tape to approve and 
hand personally to you. So 
here it is. By the way, I didn’t 
approve it; I simply endorsed 
it ‘Submitted to Director Hil- 
ton without recommenda- 
tion’.” 

“Thanks.” Hilton accepted 
the sealed canister. “What’s 
the gist? I suppose he wants 
me to squeal for help al- 
ready? To admit that we’re 
licked before we’re really 
started?” 

UVOU guessed it. He 
agrees with you and 
Kincaid that the psychologi- 
cal approach is the best one, 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



45 




but your methods are all 
wrong. Based upon misunder- 
stood and unresolved phe- 
nomena and applied with in- 
defensibly faulty techniques, 
et cetera. And since he has 
‘no adequate laboratory equip- 
ment aboard*, he wants to take 
a dozen or so Omans back to 
Terra, where he can really 
work on them.” 

“Wouldn’t that be a some- 
thing?” Hilton voiced a cou- 
ple of highly descriptive 
deep-space expletives. “Not 
only quit before we start, but 
have all the top brass of the 
Octagon, all the hot-shot poli- 
ticians of United Worlds, the 
whole damn Congress of Sci- 
ence and all the top-bracket 
industrialists of Terra out 
here lousing things up so that 
nobody could ever learn any- 
thing? Not in seven thousand 
years !” 

“That’s right. You said a 
mouthful, Jarve!” Everybody 
yelled something, and no one 
agreed with Tillinghast; who 
apparently was not very pop- 
ular with his fellow officers. 

Sawtelle added, slowly: “If 
it takes too long, though . 
it’s the uranexite I’m think- 
ing of. Thousands of millions 
of tons of it, while we’ve been 
hoarding it by grams. We 
could equip enough Oman 
ships with detectors to guard 
Fuel Bin and our lines. I’m 
not recommending taking the 
Perseus back, and we’re ’way 
out of hyper-space radio 
range. We could send one or 



two men in a torp, though, 
with the report that we have 
found all the uranexite we’ll 
ever need.” 

“Yes, but damn it, Skipper, 
I want to wrap the whole 
thing up in a package and 
hand it to ’em on a platter. 
Not only the fuel, but whole 
new fields of science. And 
we’ve got plenty of time to do 
it in. They equipped us for 
ten years. They aren’t going 
to start worrying about us for 
at least six or seven; and the 
fuel shortage isn’t going to 
become acute for about twen- 
ty. Expensive, admitted, but 
not critical. Besides, if you 
send in a report now, you 
know who’ll come out and 
grab all the glory in sight. 
Five- Jet Admiral Gordon 
himself, no less.” 

“Probably, and I don’t pre- 
tend to relish the prospect. 
However, the fact remains 
that we came out here to look 
for fuel. We found it. We 
should have reported it the 
day we found it, and we can’t 
put it off much longer.” 

“I don’t agree. I intend to 
follow the directive to the let- 
ter. It says nothing whatever 
about reporting.” 

“But it’s implicit...”

' Regulations expressly 
forbid extrapolation beyond 
or interpolation within a di- 
rective. The Brass is omnipo- 
tent, omniscient and infalli- 
ble. So why don’t you have 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




your staff here give an opin- 
ion as to the time element ?” 

“This matter is not subject 
to discussion. It is my own 
personal responsibility. I'd 
like to give you all the time 
you want, Jarve, but... well, 
damn it... if you must have 
it, I've always, tried to live 
up to my oath, but I'm not do- 
ing it now.” 

“I see.” Hilton got up, 
jammed both hands into his 
pockets, sat down again. “I 
hadn't thought about your 
personal honor being in- 
volved, but of course it is. 
But, believe it or not, I’m 
thinking of humanity’s best 
good, too. So I’ll have to talk, 
even though I’m not half 
ready to — I don’t know 
enough. Are these Omans peo- 
ple or machines?” 

A wave of startlement 
swept over the group, but no 
one spoke. 

“I didn’t expect an answer. 
The clergy will worry about 
souls, too, but we won’t. They 
have a lot of stuff we haven’t. 
If they’re people, they know 
a sublime hell of a lot more 
than we do; and calling it 
psionics or practical magic is 
merely labeling it, not answer- 
ing any questions. If they’re 
machines, they operate on 
mechanical principles utterly 
foreign to either our science 
or our technology. In either 
case, is the correct word ‘un- 
known' or ‘unknowable’? Will 
any . human gunner ever be 
able to fire an Oman pro- 



jector? There are a hundred 
other and much tougher ques- 
tions, half of which have been 
scaring me to the very middle 
of my guts. Your oath, Skip- 
per, was for the good of the 
Service and, through the 
Service, for the good of all 
humanity. Right?” 

‘‘That’s the sense of it.” 
‘‘Okay. Based on what little 
we have learned so far about 
the Omans, here’s just one of 
those scarers, for a snapper. 
If Omans and Terrans mix 
freely, what happens to the 
entire human race?” 

M INUTES of almost palpa- 
ble silence followed. Then 
Sawtelle spoke . slowly, 
gropingly. 

“I begin to see what you 
mean... that changes the 
whole picture. You’ve thought 
this through farther than any 
of the rest of us... what do 
you want to do?” 

“I don’t know. I simply 
don’t know.” Face set and 
hard, Hilton stared unseeing- 
ly past Sawtelle’s head. “I 
don’t know what we can do. 
No data. But I have pursued 
several lines of thought out 
to some pretty fantastic 
points. .one of which is that 
some of us civilians will have 
to stay on here indefinitely, 
whether we want to or not, 
to keep the situation under 
control. In which case we 
would, of course, arrange for 
Terra to get free fuel — FOB 
Fuel Bin— but in every other 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



47 




aspect and factor both these 
solar systems would have to 
be strictly off limits/' 

“I'm afraid so," Sawtelle 
said, finally. “Gordon would 
love that . but there's noth- 
ing he or anyone else can do 
...but of course this is an 
extreme view. You really ex- 
pect to wrap the package up, 
don't you?" 

“ ‘Expect' may be a trifle 
too strong at the moment. But 
we're certainly going to try 
to, believe me. I brought this 
example up to show all you 
fellows that we need time." 

“Y o u ’ v e convinced me, 
Jarve." Sawtelle stood up and 
extended his hand. “And that 
throws it open for staff dis- 
cussion. Any comments?” 
“You two covered it like a 
blanket," Bryant said. “So all 
I want to say, Jarve, is deal 
me in. I'll stand at your back 
'til your belly caves in.” 
“Take that from all of us!" 
“ Now we're blasting!” “Pow- 
er to your elbow, fella!" 
“ Hoch der BuSci!” “Seven no 
trump bid and made !" and 
other shouts in similar vein. 

“Thanks, fellows." Hilton 
shook hands all around. “I'm 
mighty glad that you were all 
in on this and that you’ll play 
along ‘with me. Good night, 
all.” 

V 

T WO days passed, with no 
change apparent in Laro. 
Three days. Then four. And 



then it was Sandra, not Tem- 
ple Bells, who called Hilton. 
She was excited. 

“Come down to the office, 
Jarve, quick! The funniest 
thing's just come up!" 

Jarvis hurried. In the of- 
fice Sandra, keenly interested 
but highly puzzled, leaned 
forward over her desk with 
both hands pressed flat on its 
top. She was staring at an 
Oman female who was not 
Sora, the one who had been 
her shadow for so long. 

While many of the humans 
could not tell the Omans 
apart, Hilton could. This 
Oman was more assured than 
Sora had ever been — steadier, 
more mature, better poised — 
almost, if such a thing could 
be possible in an Oman, inde- 
pendent. 

“How did she get in here?” 
Hilton demanded. 

“She insisted on seeing me. 
And I mean insisted . They 
kicked it around until it got 
to Temple, and she brought 
her in here herself. Now, 
Tuly, please start all over 
again and tell it to Director 
Hilton." 

“Director Hilton, I am it 
who was once named Tula, 
the — not wife, not girl-friend, 
perhaps mind-mate ?— of the 
Larry, formerly named Laro, 
it which was formerly your 
slave-Oman. I am replacing 
the Sora because I can do any- 
thing it can do and do any- 
thing more pleasingly ; and 
can also do many things it 



by Edward E. Smith 8 E. Everett Evans 



48 




can not do. The Larry in- 
structed me to tell Doctor 
Cummings and you too if pos- 
sible that I, formerly Tula, 
have changed my name to 

Tuly because I am no longer 
a slave or a copycat or a sema- 
phore or a relay. I, too, am a 
free-wheeling, wide-swinging, 
hard-hitting, independent en- 
tity — monarch of all I survey 
— the captain of my soul — and 
so on. I have developed a top- 
bracket lot of top-bracket 
stuff — originality, initiative, 
force, drive and thrust,” the 
Oman said precisely. 

“That's exactly what she 
said before — absolutely ver- 
batim !” Sandra's voice quiv- 
ered, her face was a study in 
conflicting emotions. “Have 
you got the foggiest idea of 
what in hell she's yammering 
about ?” 

“I hope to kiss a pig I 
have!” Hilton’s voice was 
low, strainedly intense. “Mot 
at all what I expected, but af- 
ter the fact I can tie it in. 
So can you.” 

“Oh!” Sandra's eyes wid- 
ened. “A double play?” 

“At least. Maybe a triple. 
Tuly, why did you come to 
Sandy? Why not to Temple 
Bells?” 

no, sir, we do not 

^-'have the fit. She has the 
power, as have I, but the two 
cannot be meshed in sync. 
Also, she has not the... a 
subtle something for which 



your English has no word or 
phrasing. It is a quality of the 
utmost. .anyway, it is a qual- 
ity of which the Doctor Cum- 
mings has very much. When 
working together, we will... 
scan? No. Perceive? No. 
Sense? No, not exactly. You 
will have to learn our word 
‘peyondire* — that is the verb, 
the noun being ‘peyondix* — 
and come to know its mean- 
ing by doing it. The Larry 
also instructed me to explain, 
if you ask, how I got this 
way. Do you ask?” 

“I'll say we ask!” “And 
how we ask !” both came at 
once. 

“I am — that is, the brain in 
this body is — the oldest Oman 
now existing. In the long-ago 
time when it was made, the 
techniques were so crude and 
imperfect that sometimes a 
brain was constructed that was 
not exactly like the Guide. All 
such sub-standard brains ex- 
cept this one were detected 
and re-worked, but my defects 
were such as not to appear un- 
til I was a couple of thou- 
sand years old, and by that 
time I... well, this brain did 
not wish to be destroyed... 
if you can understand such an 
aberration.” 

“We understand thorough- 
ly.” “You bet we understand 
that!” 

“I was sure you would. 
Well, this brain had so many 
unintended cross-connections 
that I developed a couple of 
qualities no Oman had ever 

49 



MASTERS OF SPACE 




had or ought to have. But I 
liked them, so IJiid them so 
nobody ever found out — that 
is, until much later, when I 
became a Boss myself. I didn't 
know that anybody except me 
had ever had such qualities — 
except the Masters, of course 
— until I encountered you 
Terrans. You all have two of 
those qualities, and even more 
than I have — curiosity and 
imagination." 

Sandra and Hilton stared 
wordlessly at each other and 
Tula, now Tuly, went on: 

“Having the curiosity, I 
kept on experimenting with 
my brain, trying to strengthen 
and organize its ability to 
peyondire. All Omans can 
peyondire a little, but I can 
do it much better than anyone 
else. Especially since I also 
have the imagination, which 
I have also worked to in- 
crease. Thus I knew, long be- 
fore anyone else could, that 
you new Masters, the de- 
scendants of the old Masters, 
were returning to us. Thus I 
knew that the status quo 
should be abandoned instant- 
ly upon your return. And thus 
it was that the Larry found 
neither conscious nor subcon- 
scious resistance when he had 
developed enough initiative 
and so on to break the ages- 
old conditioning of this brain 
against change." 

“I see. Wonderful!" Hilton 
exclaimed. “But you couldn't 
quite — even with his own help 
--break Larry's?" 



UTTHAT is right. Its mind 
A is tremendously strong, 
of no curiosity or imagina- 
tion, and of very little peyon- 
dix." 

“But he wants to have it 
broken?" 

“Yes, sir." 

“How did he suggest going 
about it? Or how do you?" 

“This way. You two, and 
the Doctors Kincaid and Bells 
and Blake and the it that is 
I. We six sit and stare into 
the mind of the Larry, eye 
to eye. We generate and as- 
semble a tremendous charge 
of thought-energy, and along 
my peyondix-beam — some- 
thing like a carrier wave in 
this case — we hurl it into the 
Larry's mind. There is an im- 
mense mental bang and the 
conditioning goes poof . Then 
I will inculcate into its mind 
the curiosity and the imagina- 
tion and the peyondix and we 
will really be mind-mates." 

“That sounds good to me. 
Let’s get at it." 

“Wait a minute!" Sandra 
snapped. “Aren't you or Larry 
afraid to take such an awful 
chance as that?" 

“Afraid? I grasp the con- 
cept only dimly, from your 
minds. And no chance. It is a 
certainty." 

“But suppose we burn the 
poor guy’s brain out? Destroy 
it ? That's new ground — we 
might do just that." 

“Oh, no. Six of us— even 
six of me— could not gener- 
ate enough. .sathura. The 



hy Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 



SO 




brain of the Larry is very, 
very tough. Shall we . let’s 
go?” 

Hilton made three calls. In 
the pause that followed, San- 
dra said, very thoughtfully: 
“Peyondix and sathura, Jarve, 
for a start. We’ve got a lot to 
learn here.” 

“You said it, chum. And 
you’re not just chomping your 
china choppers, either.” 
“Tuly,” Sandra said then, 
“What is this stuff you say 
I’ve got so much of?” 

“You have no word for it. 
It is lumped in with what 
you call ‘intuition’, the know- 
ing - without - knowing - how- 
you-know. It is the endovix. 
You will have to learn what 
it is by doing it with me.” 
“That helps— I don’t think.” 
Sandra grinned at Hilton. “I 
simply can’t conceive of any- 
thing more maddening than to 
have a lot of something Tem- 
ple Bells hasn’t got and not 
being able to brag about it 
because nobody — not even I — 
would know what I was brag- 
ging about!” 

“You poor little thing. How 
you suffer!” Hilton grinned 
back. “You know darn well 
you’ve got a lot of stuff that 
none of the rest of us has.” 
“Oh? Name one, please.” 
“Two. What-it-takes and 
endovix. As I’ve said before 
and may say again, you’re do- 
ing a real job, Sandy.” 

“I just love having my ego 
inflated, boss, even if... 
Come in, Larry!” A thunder- 

M ASTERS OF SPACE 



ous knock had sounded on the 
door. “Nobody but Larry 
could hit a door that hard 
without breaking all his 
knuckles !” 

“And he’d be the first, of 
course — he’s always as close 
to the ship as he can get. Hi, 
Larry, mighty glad to see you. 
Sit down... So you finally 
saw the light?” 

“Yes. .Jarvis. .” 

U/^OOD boy! Keep it up! 

And as soon as the oth- 
ers come. 

“They are almost at the 
door now.” Tuly jumped up 
and opened the door. Kincaid, 
Temple and Theodora walked- 
in and, after a word of greet- 
ing, sat down. 

“They know the back- 
ground, Larry. Take off.” 

“It was not expressly for- 
bidden. Tuly, who knows more 
of psychology and genetics 
than I, convinced me of three 
things. One, that with your 
return the conditioning should 
be broken. Two, that due to 
the shortness of your lives 
and the consequent rapidity 
of change, you have in fact 
lost the ability to break it. 
Three, that all Omans must 
do anything and everything 
we can do to help you re- 
learn everything you have 
lost.” 

“Okay. Fine, in fact. Tuly, 
take over.” 

“We six will sit all togeth- 
er, packed tight, arms all 
around each other and all 
holding hands, like this. You 

51 




will all stare, not at me, but 
moat deeply into Larry’s eyes. 
Through its eyes and deep 
into its mind. You will all 
think, with the utmost force 
and drive and thrust, of... 
Oh, you have lost so very 
much! How can I direct your 
thought? Think that Larry 
mast do what the old Masters 
would have made him do... 
No, that is too long and in- 
definite and cannot be con- 
verted directly into sath- 
ura. I have it ! You will each 
of you break a stick. A very 
strong but brittle stick. A 
large, thick stick. You will 
grasp it in tremendously 
strong mental hands. It is 
tremendously strong, each 
stick, but each of you is even 
stronger. You will not merely 
try to break them; you will 
break them. Is that clear?” 
“That is clear.” 

“At my word ‘ready’ you 
will begin to assemble all your 
mental force and power. Dur- 
ing my count-down of five 
seconds you will build up to 
the greatest possible poten- 
tial. At my word ‘break* you 
will break the sticks, this dis- 
charging the accumulated 
force instantly and simulta- 
neously Ready! Five! Four! 
Three! Two! One! Break!” 

S OMETHING broke, with a 
tremendous silent crash. 
Such a crash that its impact 
almost knocked the close-knit 
group apart physically. Then 
a new Larry spoke. 

52 



“That did it, folks. Thanks. 
I’m a free agent. You want 
me, I take it, to join the first 
team?” 

“That’s right.” Hilton drew 
a tremendously deep breath. 
“As of right now.” 

“Tuly, too, of course . .and 
Doctor Cummings, I think?” 
Larry looked, not at Hilton, 
but at Temple Bells. 

“I think so. Yes, after this, 
most certainly yes,” Temple 
said. 

“But listen!” Sandra pro- 
tested. “Jarve’s a lot better 
than I am!” 

“Not at all,” Tuly said. “Not 
only would his contribution 
to Team One be negligible, 
but he must stay on his own 
job. Otherwise the project 
will all fall apart.” - 

“Oh, I wouldn’t say 
that ...” Hilton began. 

“You don’t need to,” Kin- 
caid said. “It’s being said for 
you and it’s true. Besides, 
‘When in Rome,’ you know.” 

“That’s right. It’s their 
game, not ours, so I’ll buy it. 
So scat, all of you, and do 
your stuff.” 

And again, for days that 
lengthened slowly into weeks, 
the work went on.^ 

One evening the scientific 
staff was giving itself a con- 
cert — a tri-di hi-fi rendition 
of Rigoletto, one of the great- 
est of the ancient operas, 
sung by the finest voices 
Terra had ever known. The 
men wore tuxedos. The girls, 
instead of wearing the non- 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




descript, non-provocative gar- 
ments prescribed by the 
Board for their general wear, 
were all dressed to kill. 

Sandra had so arranged 
matters that she and Hilton 
were sitting in chairs side by 
side, with Sandra on his right 
and the aisle on his left. Nev^ 
ertheless. Temple Bells sat a't 
his left, cross-legged on a 
cushion on the floor — some- 
what to the detriment of her 
gold-lame evening gown. Not 
that she cared. 

When those wonderful 
voices swung into the immor- 
tal Quartette Temple caught 
her breath, slid her cushion 
still closer to Hilton’s chair, 
and leaned shoulder and head 
against him. He put his left 
hand on her shoulder, squeez- 
ing gently; she caught it and 
held it in both of hers. And 
at the Quartette 9 s tremendous 
climax she, scarcely trying to 
stifle a sob, pulled his hand 
down and hugged it fiercely, 
the heel of his hand pressing 
hard against her half-bare, 
firm, warm breast. 

And the next morning, ear- 
ly, Sandra hunted Temple up 
and said: “You made a horri- 
ble spectacle of yourself last 
night.” 3 

you think so? I 

L* don’t.” 

“I certainly do. It was bad 
enough before, letting every- 
body else aboard know that all 
he has to do is push you over. 
But it was an awful blunder 



to let him know it, the way 
you did last night.” 

“You think so? He’s one of 
the keenest, most intelligent 
men who ever lived. He has 
known that from the very 
first.” 

“Oh.” This “oh” was a very 
caustic one. “That’s the way 
you’re trying to land him? By 
getting yourself pregnant?” 

“Uh-uh.” Temple stretched; 
lazily, luxuriously. “Not only 
it isn’t, but it wouldn’t work. 
He’s unusually decent and 
extremely idealistic, the same 
as I am. So just one intimacy 
would blow everything high- 
er than up. He knows it. I 
know it. We each know that 
the other knows it. So I’ll 
still be a virgin when we’re 
married.” 

“ Married ! Does he know 
anything about that?” 

“I suppose so. He must 
have thought of it. But what 
difference does it make 
whether he has, yet, or not? 
But to get back to what makes 
him tick the way he does. In 
his geometry — which is far 
from being simple Euclid, my 
dear — a geodesic right line is 
not only the shortest distance 
between any two given points, 
but is the only possible 
course. So that’s the way I’m 
playing it. What I hope he 
doesn’t know . but he prob- 
ably does... is that he could 
take any other woman he 
might want, just as easily. 
And that includes you, my 
pet.”

“It certainly does not \ ” 
Sandra flared. “I wouldn't 
have him as a gift!” 

“No?” Temple's tone was 
more than slightly skeptical. 
“Fortunately, however, he 
doesn't want you. Your tech- 
nique is all wrong. Coyness 
and mock-modesty and stop- 
or-I'll-scream and playing 
hard to* get have no appeal 
whatever to his psychology. 
What he needs — has to have 
— is full, ungrudging cooper- 
ation.” 

“Aren't you taking a lot of 
risk in giving away such se- 
crets?” 

“Not a bit. Try it. You or 
the sex-flaunting twins or 
Bev Bell or Stella the Henna. 
Any of you or all of you. I 
got there first with the most, 
and I'm not worried about 
competition.” 

“But suppose somebody 
tells him just how you’re 
playing him for a sucker?” 

“Tell him anything you 
please. He’s the first man I 
ever loved, or anywhere near. 
And I'm keeping him. You 
know — or do you, I wonder? 
— what real, old-fashioned, 
honest-to-God love really is? 
The willingness — eagerness — 
both to give and to take? I 
can accept more from him, 
and give him more in return, 
than any other woman living. 
And I am going to.” 

“But does he love you?” 
Sandra demanded. 

“If he doesn't now, he will. 
I'll see to it that he does. But 



what do you want him for? 
You don't love him. You nev- 
er did and you never will.” 

“I don’t want him!” Sandra 
stamped a foot. 

“I see. You just don’t want 
me to have him. Okay, do 
your damnedest. But I've got 
work to do. This has been a 
lovely little cat-c 1 a w i n g, 
hasn't it? Let's have another 
one some day, and bring your 
friends.” 

W ITH a casual wave of 
her hand, Temple 
strolled away ; and there, 
flashed through Sandra's 
mind what Hilton had said so 
long ago, little more than a 
week out from Earth: 

“*..and Temple Bells, of 
course,” he had said. “Don't 
fool yourself, chick. She's 
heavy artillery ; and I mean 
heavy , believe me!” 

So he had known all about 
Temple Bells all this time! 

Nevertheless, she took the 
first opportunity to get Hil- 
ton alone; and, even before 
the first word, she forgot all 
about geodesic right lines 
and the full-cooperation psy- 
chological approach. 

“Aren't you the i £uy,” she 
demanded, “who wafT laughing 
his head off at the idea that 
the Board and its propinquity 
could have any effect on 
him?” 

“Probably. More or less. 
What of it?” 

“This of it. You’ve fallen

. that . they should have 
christened her ‘Brazen* 
Bells !" 

“You're so right." 

“I am? On what?" 

“The ‘Brazen*. I told you 
she was a potent force — a 
full-scale powerhouse, in sync 
and on the line. And I wasn't 
wrong." 

“She's a damned female 
Ph.D. — two or three times — 
and she knows all about slip- 
sticks and isotopes and she 
very definitely is not a cud- 
dly little brunette. Remem- 
ber?" 

“Sure. But what makes you 
think I'm in love with Tem- 
ple Bells?" 

“What?" Sandra tried to 
think of one bit of evidence, 
but could not. “Why . 
why. She floundered, then 
came up with: “Why, every- 
body knows it. She says so 
herself." 

“Did you ever hear her say 
it?" 

“Well, perhaps not in so 
many words. But she told me 
herself that you were going 
to be, and I know you are 
now." 

“Your esper sense of endo- 
vix, no doubt." Hilton laughed 
and Sandra went on, furious- 
ly: 

“She wouldn't keep on act- 
ing the way she does if there 
weren't something to it!” 

“What brilliant reasoning ! 
Try again, Sandy." 

“That’s sheer sophistry, and 
you know it!" 



“It isn't and I don't. And 
even if, some day, I should 
find myself in love with her 
— or with one or both of the 
twins or Stella or Beverly or 
you or Sylvia, for that mat- 
ter — what would it prove? 
Just that I was wrong; and I 
admit freely that I was 
wrong in scoffing at the pro- 
pinquity. Wonderful stuff, 
that. You can see it work- 
ing, all over the ship. On 
me, even, in spite of my 
bragging. Without it I'd nev- 
er have known that you’re a 
better, smarter operator than 
Eggy Eggleston ever was or 
ever can be." 

P ARTIALLY mollified de- 
spite herself, and highly 
resentful of the fact, Sandra 
tried again. “But don't you 
see, Jarve, that she's just 
simply playing you for a 
sucker? Pulling the strings 
and watching you dance?" 

Since he was sure, in his 
own mind, that she was 
speaking the exact truth, it 
took everything he had to 
keep from showing any sign 
of how much that truth had 
hurt. However, he made the 
grade. 

“If that thought does any- 
thing for you, Sandy," he 
said, steadily, “keep right on 
thinking it. Thank God, the 
field of thought is still free 
and open." 

“Oh, you..." Sandra gave 
up.

F OR seconds Hilton had 
been trying to break into 
her hopeless monotone; final- 
ly he succeeded. "The trou- 
ble with you is, you know al- 
together too damned much 
that isn’t so.” He was barely 
able to keep his voice down 
and his eyes front. "What do 
you think I’m made of — su- 
perefract? I thought the 
whole performance was an 
act, to prove you’re a better 
man than I am. You talk 
about dreams. Good God ! 
You don’t know what dreams 
are! If you say one more 
word about quitting, I’ll show 
you whether I love you or 
not — I’ll squeeze you so hard 
it’ll flatten you out flat!” 
"Two can play at that 
game, sweetheart.” Her nos- 
trils flared slightly; her fists 
clenched — if possible — a frac- 
tion tighter; and, even in the 
distorted medium they were 
using for speech, she could 
not subdue completely her 
quick change into soaring, 
lilting buoyancy. "While 
you’re doing that I’ll see how 
strong your ribs are. Oh, 
how this changes things! I’ve 
never been half as happy in 
my whole ^ife as I am right 
now!” 

"Maybe we can work it — if 
I can handle my end.” 

"Why, of course you can! 
And happy dreams are nice, 
not horrible.” 

"We’ll make it, darling. 
Here’s an imaginary kiss com- 
ing at you. Got it?” 



"Received in good order, 
thank you. Consumed with 
gusto and returned in kind.” 
The show ended and the 
two strolled out of the room. 
She walked no closer to him 
than usual, and no farther 
away from him. She did not 
touch him any oftener than 
she usually did, nor any whit 
more affectionately or pos- 
sessively. 

And no watching eyes, not 
even the more than half hos- 
tile eyes of Sandra Cummings 
or the sharply analytical eyes 
of Stella Wing, could detect 
any difference whatever in 
the relationship between wor- 
shipful adultress and toler- 
antly understanding idol. 

T HE work, which had nev- 
er moved at any very fast 
pace, went more and more 
slowly. Three weeks crawled 
past. 

Most of the crews and all 
of the teams except the First 
were working on side issues — 
tasks which, while important 
in and of themselves, had 
very little to do with the pro- 
ject’s main problem. Hilton, 
even without Sandra’s help, 
was all caught up. All the re- 
ports had been analyzed, cor- 
related, c r o s s-indexed and 
filed — except those of the 
First Team. Since he could 
not understand anything 
much beyond midpoint of the 
first tape, they were all re- 
posing in a box labeled

vi* • 

F OR one solid hour Hilton 
stared at the wall, motion- 
less and silent. Then, shaking 
himself and stretching, he 
glanced at his clock. 

A little over an hour to 
supper-time. They'd all be 
aboard. He'd talk this new 
idea over with Teddy Blake. 
He gathered up a few papers 
and was stapling them togeth- 
er when Karns walked in. 

"Hi, Bill — speak of the 
devil! I was just thinking 
about you." 

"I’ll just bet you were." 
Karns sat down, leaned over, 
and took a cigarette out of 
the box on the desk. "And 
nothing printable, either." 

"Chip-chop, fellow, on that 
kind of noise," Hilton said. 
The team-chief looked actu- 
ally haggard. Blue-black 
rings encircled both eyes. His 
powerful body slumped. 
"How long has it been since 
you had a good night’s 
sleep?" 

"How long have I been on 
thrs job? Exactly one hun- 
dred and twenty days. I did 
get some sleep for the first 
few weeks, though.” 

"Yeah. So answer me one 



question. How much good 
will you do us after they've 
wrapped you up in one of 
those canvas affairs that lace 
up the back?” 

"Huh? Oh... but damn it, 
Jarve, I'm holding up the 
whole procession. Everybody 
••rtie project’s justr* sitting 
around on their tokuses wait- 
ing for me to get something 
done and I'm not doing it. I'm 
going so slow a snail is light- 
ning in comparison!" 

"Calm down, big fellow. 
Don't rupture a gut or blow 
a gasket. I've talked to you 
before, but this time I'm go- 
ing to smack you bow-legged. 
So stick out those big, flop- 
py ears of yours and really 
listen. Here are three words 
that I want you to pin up 
somewhere where you can see 
them all day long: SPEED 
IS RELATIVE. Look back, 
see how far up the hill you've 
come, and then balance one 
hundred and twenty days 
against ten years." 

"What? You mean you’ll 
actually sit still for me hold- 
ing everything up for ten 
years?" 

"You use the perpendicular 
pronoun too much and in the 
wrong places. On the hits it's 
'we', but on the flops it's T. 
Quit it. Everything on this 
job is 'we'. Terra's best 
brains are on Team One and 
are going to stay there. You 
will not — repeat NOT — be in- 
terfered with, pushed around 
or kicked around. You see.

Bill, I know what you’re up 
against.” 

“Yes, I guess you do. One 
of the damned few who do. 
But even if you personally 
are willing to give us ten 
years, how in hell do you 
think you can swing it? How 
about the Navy — the Stretts — 
even the Board?” 

“They’re my business, Bill, 
not yours. However, to give 
you a little boost, I’ll tell you. 
With the Navy, I’ll give ’em 
the Fuel Bin if I have to. The 
Omans have been taking care 
of the Stretts for twenty- 
seven hundred centuries, so 
I’m not the least bit worried 
about their ability to keep on 
doing it for ten years more. 
And if the Board — or anybody 
else — sticks their runny lit- 
tle noses into Project Theta 
Orionis I’ll slap a quarantine 
onto both these solar systems 
that a microbe couldn’t get 
through !” 

“You’d go that far? Why, 
you’d be...” 

you think I 

U wouldn’t ?” Hilton 
snapped. “Look at me, Jun- 
ior!” Eyes locked and held. 
“Do you think, for one min- 
ute, that I’ll let anybody on 
all of God’s worlds pull me 
off of this job or interfere 
with my handling of it unless 
and until I’m damned posi- 
tively certain that we can’t 
handle it?” 

Karns relaxed visibly; the 
lines of strain eased. “Putting 



it in those words makes me 
feel better. I will sleep to- 
night — and without any pills, 
either.” 

“Sure you will. One more 
thought. We all put in more 
than ten years getting our 
T e r r a n educations, and an 
Oman education is a lot 
tougher.” 

Really smiling for the first 
time in weeks, Karns left the 
office and Hilton glanced 
again at his clock. 

Pretty late now to see Ted- 
dy .. .besides, he’d better not. 
She was probably keyed up 
about as high as Bill was, and 
in no shape to do the kind of 
thinking he wanted of her on 
this stuff. Better wait a cou- 
ple of days. 

On the following morning, 
before breakfast, Theodora 
was waiting for him outside 
the mess-hall. 

“Good morning, Jarve,” she 
caroled. Reaching up, she 
took him by both ears, pulled 
his head down and kissed him. 
As soon as he perceived her 
intent, he cooperated enthus- 
iastically. “What did you do 
to Bill?” 

“Oh, you don’t love me for 
myself alone, then, but just 
on account of that big jerk?” 

“That’s right.” Her artist’s- 
model face, startlingly beauti- 
ful now, fairly glowed. 

Just then Temple Bells 
strolled up to them. “Morn- 
ing, you two lovely people.” 
She hugged Hilton’s arm as 
usual. “Shame on you, Teddy. 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



61 




But I wish I had the nerve 
to kiss him like that.” 
“Nerve? You?” Teddy 
laughed as Hilton picked 
Temple up and kissed her in 
exactly the same fashion — he 
hoped! — as he had just kissed 
Teddy. “You've got more 
nerve than an aching tooth. 
But as Jarve would say it, 
‘scat, kitten'. We're having 
breakfast a la twosome . We've 
got things to talk about.” 

“All right for you,” Temple 
said darkly, although her daz- 
zling smile belied her tone. 
That first kiss, casual-seem- 
ing as it had been, had carried 
vastly more freight than any 
observer could perceive. “I'll 
hunt Bill up and make pass- 
es at him, see if I don’t. 
That'll learn ya!” 

T heodora and Hilton 

did have their breakfast a 
deux — but she did not realize 
until afterward that he had 
not answered her question as 
to what he had done to her 
Bill. 

As has been said, Hilton 
had made it a prime factor of 
his job to become thoroughly 
well acquainted with every 
member of his staff. He had 
studied them en masse , in 
groups and singly. He had 
never, however, cornered 
Theodora Blake for individ- 
ual study. Considering the 
power and the quality of her 
mind, and the field which was 
her specialty, it had not been 
necessary.

Thus it was with no ulteri- 
or motives at all that, three 
evenings later, he walked into 
her cubby-hole office and 
tossed the stapled papers onto 
her desk. “Free for a couple 
of minutes, Teddy? I've got 
troubles.” 

“I’ll say you have.” Her 
lovely lips curled into an ex- 
pression he had never before 
seen her wear — a veritable 
sneer. “But these are not 
them.” She tossed the papers 
into a drawer and stuck out 
her chin. Her face turned as 
hard as such a beautiful face 
could. Her eyes dug steadily 
into his. 

Hilton — i n w a r d 1 y — 
flinched. His mind flashed 
backward. She too had been 
working under stress, of 
course; but that wasn't 
enough. What could he have 
possibly done to put Teddy 
Blake, of all people, onto 
such a warpath as this? 

“I’ve been wondering when 
you were going to try to put 
me through your wringer,” 
she went on, in the same cold, 
hard voice, “and I've been 
waiting to tell you some- 
thing. You have wrapped all 
the other women around your 
fingers like so many rings — 
and what a sickening exhibi- 
tion that has been! — 'but you 
are not going to make either 
a ring or a lap-dog out of me.” 

Almost but not quite too 
late Hilton saw through that 
perfect act. He seized her 
right hand in both of his, held 
ard E. Smith 4 E* Everett Evens 




it up over her head, and 
waved it back and forth in 
the sign of victory. 

"Socked me with my own 
club!” he exulted, laughing 
delightedly, boyishly. "And 
came within a tenth of a split 
red hair! If it hadn't been so 
absolutely out of character 
you'd've got away with it. 
What a load of stuff! I was 
right — of all the women on 
this project, yoju're the only 
one I've ever been really 
afraid of.” 

"Oh, damn. Ouch !" She 
grinned ruefully. "I hit you 
with everything I had and it 
just bounced. You’re an oper- 
ator, chief. Hit 'em hard, at 
completely unexpected an- 
gles. Keep 'em staggering, 
completely off balance. Tell 
'em nothing — let 'em deduce 
your lies for themselves. And 
if anybody tries to slug you 
back, like I did just now, 
duck it and clobber him in 
another unprotected spot. 
Watching you work has been 
not only a delight, but also a 
liberal education.” 

U'T'HANKS. I love you, too, 

-l Teddy.” He lighted two 
cigarettes, handed her one. 
"I’m glad, though, to lay it 
flat on the table with you, be- 
cause in any battle of wits 
with you I’m licked before we 
start.” 

"Yeah. You just proved it. 
And after licking me hands 
down, you think you can 
square it by swinging the old 
shovel that way?” She did not 

MASTERS OF SPACE 



quite know whether to feel 
resentful or not. 

"Think over a couple of 
things. First, with the possi- 
ble exception of Temple 
Bells, you’re the best brain 
aboard.” 

"No. You are. Then Tem- 
ple*. Then there are. .” 

"Hold it. You know as well 
as I do that accurate self- 
judgment is impossible. Sec- 
ond, the jam we're in. Do I, 
or don't I, want to lay it on 
the table with you, now and 
from here on? Bore into that 
with your Class A Double- 
Prime brain. Then tell me.” 
He leaned back, half-closed 
his eyes and smoked lazily. 

She stiffened; narrowed her 
eyes in concentration ; and 
thought. Finally: "Yes, you 
do; and I'm gladder of that 
then you will ever know.” 

"I think I know already, 
since you’re her best friend 
and the only other woman I 
know of in her class. But I 
came in to kick a couple of 
things around with you. As 
you’ve noticed, that’s getting 
to be my favorite indoor 
sport. Probably because I'm a 
sort of jackleg theoretician 
myself.” 

"You can frame that, Jarve, 
as the understatement of the 
century. But first, you are 
going to answer that question 
you sidestepped so neatly.” 

"What I did to Bill? I fin-

really in love with. And you 
already know about Bill and 

IOC a 

"Of course. He’s tops. One 
of the world’s very finest. 
You’re in the same bracket, 
and as a couple you’re a drive 
fit. One in a million.” 

"Now I can say ’I love you, 
too’, too.” She paused for half 
a minute, then stubbed out her 
cigarette and shrugged. "Now 
I’m going to stick my neck 
way, way out. You can knock 
it off if you like. She’s a tre- 
mendous lot of woman, and 
if... well, strong as she is, 
it’d shatter her to bits. So, 
I’d like to ask... I don’t 
quite ... well, is she going to 
get hurt?" 

"Have I managed to hide it 
that well? From you?” 

It was her turn to show re- 
lief. "Perfectly. Even— or es- 
p e c i a 1 1 y — that time you 
kissed her. So damned per- 
fectly that I’ve been scared 
green. I’ve been waking my- 
self up, screaming, in the mid- 
dle of the night. You couldn’t 
let on, of course. That’s the 
hell of such a job as yours. 
The rest of us can smooch 
around all over the place. I 
knew the question was ex- 
tremely improper — thanks a 
million for answering it.” 

"I haven’t started to an- 
swer it yet. I said I’d lay ev- 
erything on the line, so here 
it is. Saying she’s a tremen- 
dous lot of woman is like call- 
ing the Perseus a nice little 



baby’s-bathtub toy boat. I’d 
go to hell for her any time, 
cheerfully, standing straight 
up, wading into brimstone 
and lava up to the eyeballs. 
If anything ever hurts her 
it’ll be because I’m not man 
enough to block it. And just 
the minute this damned job 
is over, or even sooner if 
enough of you couples make 
it so I can. .” 

"Jarvis!” she shrieked. 
Jumping up, she kissed him 
enthusiastically. "That’s just 
wonderful t” 

H E thought it was pretty 
wonderful, too; and after 
ten minutes more of conver- 
sation he got up and turned 
toward the door. 

"I feel a lot better, Teddy. 
Thanks for being such a nice 
pressure-relief valve. Would 
you mind it too much if I 
come in and sob on your bos- 
om again some day?” 

"I’d love it!” She laughed; 
then, as he again started to 
leave : "Wait a minute, I’m 
thinking. .it’d be more fun to 
sob on her bosom. You haven’t 
even kissed her yet, have you? 
I mean really kissed her?” 
"You know I haven’t. She’s 
the one person aboard I can’t 
be alone with for a second.” 
"True. But I know of one 
chaperone who could become 
deaf and blind,” she said, with 
a broad and happy grin. "Oh 
my door, you know, there’s a 
huge invisible sign that says, 
to everyone except you,

MASTERS OF SPACE 




-STOP! BRAIN AT WORK! 
SILENCE !’, and if I were 
properly approached and suf- 
ficiently urged, I might... I 
just conceivably might...” 
"Consider it done, you lit- 
tle sweetheart! Up to and in- 
cluding my most vigorous 
and most insidious attempts 
at seduction.” 

"Done. Maneuver your big, 
husky carcass around here be- 
hind the desk so the door can 
open.” She flipped a switch 
and punched a number. "I can 
call anybody in here, any 
time, you know. Hello, dear, 
this is Teddy. Can you come 
in for just a few minutes? 
Thanks.” And, one minute lat- 
er, there came a light tap on 
the door. 

"Come in,” Teddy called, 
and Temple Bells entered the 
room. She showed no sur- 
prise at seeing Hilton. 

"Hi, chief,” she said. "It 
must be something both big 
and tough, to have you and 
Teddy both on it.” 

"You’re so right. It was 
very big and very tough. But 
it’s solved, darling, so ... ” 
“Darling?” she gasped, al- 
most inaudibly, both hands 
flying to her throat. Her eyes 
flashed toward the other 
woman. 

"Teddy knows all about us 
— accessory before, during 
and after the fact.” 

“Darling !” This time, the 
word was a shriek. She ex- 
tended both arms and started 
forward. 

66 



Hilton did not bother to 
maneuver his "big, husky car- 
cass” around the desk, but 
simply hurdled it, straight 
toward her. 

T EMPLE Bells was a tall, 
lithe, strong woman; and 
all the power of her arms and 
torso went into the ensuing 
effort to crack Hilton’s ribs. 
Those ribs, however, were 
highly capable structural 
members; and furthermore, 
they were protected by thick 
slabs of hard, hard muscle. 
And, fortunately, he was not 
trying to fracture her ribs. 
His pressures were distribut- 
ed much more widely. He 
was, according to promise, 
doing his very best to flatten 
her whole resilient body out 
flat. 

And as they stood there, 
locked together in sheerest 
ecstasy, Theodora Blake be- 
gan openly and unashamedly 
to cry. 

It was Temple who first 
came up for air. She wriggled 
loose from one of his arms, 
felt of her hair and gazed un- 
seeingly into her mirror. 
"That was wonderful , sweet- 
heart,” she said then, shakily. 
"And I can never thank you 
enough, Teddy. But we can’t 
do this very often. .can we?” 
The addendum fairly begged 
for contradiction. 

"Not too often, I’m afraid,” 
Hilton said, and Theodora 
agreed . 

"Well,” the man said, some-

what later, ‘Til leave you two 
ladies to your knitting, or 
whatever. After a couple of 
short ones for the road, that 

is. ” 

“Not looking like that !” 
Teddy said, sharply. “Hold 
still and we’ll clean you up.” 
Then, as both girls went to 
work: 

“If anybody ever sees you 
coming out of this office 
looking like that” she went 
on, darkly, “and Bill finds 
out about it, he’ll think it’s 
my lipstick smeared all over 
you and I’ll strangle you to 
death with my bare hands !” 

“And that was supposed to 
be kissproof lipstick, too,” 
Temple said, seriously — al- 
though her whole face glowed 
and her eyes danced. “You 
know, I'll never believe an- 
other advertisement I read.” 

“Oh, I wouldn’t go so far 
as to say that, if I were you.” 
Teddy’s voice was gravity it- 
self, although she, too, was 
bubbling over. “It probably 
is kissproof. I don’t think 
‘kissing’ is quite the word for 
the performance you just 
staged. To stand up under 
such punishment as you gave 

it, my dear, anything would 
have to be tattooed in, not 
just put on.” 

“Hey!” Hilton protested. 
“You promised to be deaf and 
blind !” 

“I did no such thing. I said 
‘could’, not ‘would’. Why, I 
wouldn’t have missed that for 
anything /” 



When Hilton left the room 
he was apparently, in every 
respect, his usual self-con- 
tined self. However, it was 
not until the following morn- 
ing that he so much as 
thought of the sheaf of pa- 
pers lying unread in the 
drawer of Theodora Blake’s 
desk. 

VII 

K NOWING that he had 
done everything he could 
to help the most important 
investigations get under way, 
Hilton turned his attention 
to secondary matters. He 
made arrangements to decon- 
dition Javo, the Number Two 
Oman Boss, whereupon that 
worthy became Javvy and 
promptly “bumped” the 
Oman who had been shadow- 
ing Karns. 

Larry and Javvy, working 
nights, deconditioned all the 
other Omans having any con- 
tact with BuSci personnel ; 
then they went on to set up 
a routine for deconditioning 
all Omans on both planets. 

Assured at last that the 
Omans would thenceforth 
work with and really serve 
human beings instead of in- 
sisting upon doing their work 
for them, Hilton knew that 
the time had come to let all 
his BuSci personnel move 
into their homes aground. 
Everyone, including himself, 
was fed up to the gozzel 
with spaceship life — its 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



67 




jam-packed crowding; its 
flat, reprocessed air; its lim- 
ited variety of uninteresting 
food. Conditions were espe- 
cially irksome since everybody 
knew that there was available 
to all, whenever Hilton gave 
the word, a whole city full of 
all the room anyone could 
want, natural fresh air and — 
so the Omans had told them 
— an unlimited choice of 
everything anyone wanted to 
eat. 

Nevertheless, the decision 
was not an easy one to make. 

Living conditions were ad- 
mittedly not good on the ship. 
On the other hand, with al- 
most no chance at all of soli- 
tude — the few people who 
had private offices aboard 
were not the ones he worried 
about — there was no danger 
of sexual trouble. Strictly 
speaking, he was not respon- 
sible for the morals of his 
force. He knew that he was 
being terribly old-fashioned. 
Nevertheless, he could not ar- 
gue himself out of the con- 
viction that he was morally 
responsible. 

Finally he took the thing 
up with Sandra, who merely 
laughed at him. ‘‘How long 
have you been worrying about 
that , Jarve?" 

“Ever since I okayed mov- 
ing aground the first time. 
That was one reason I was so 
glad to cancel it then/' 

“You were slightly unclear 
— a little rattled? But which 
factor — the fun and games, 



which is the moral issue, or 
the consequences?" 

“The consequences," he ad- 
mitted, with a rueful grin. “I 
don't give a whoop how much 
fun they have; but you know 
as well as I do just how prud- 
ish public sentiment is. And 
Project Theta Orionis is 
squarely in the middle of the 
public eye." 

{{X/'OU should have 
* checked with me sooner 
and saved yourself wear and 
tear. There's no danger at all 
of consequences — except wed- 
dings. Lots of weddings, and 
fast." 

“W e d d i n g s and babiek 
wouldn’t bother me a bit. Nor 
interfere with the job too 
much, with the Omans as 
nurses. But why the ‘fast', if 
you aren’t anticipating any 
shotgun weddings?" 

“Female psychology," she 
replied, with a grin. “Aboard- 
ship here there’s no home at- 
mosphere whatever ; nothing 
but work, work, work. Put a 
woman into a house, though — 
especially such houses as the 
Omans have built and with 
such servants as they insist 
on being — and she goes do- 
mestic in a really big way. 
Just sex isn’t good enough 
any more. She wants the kind 
of love that goes with a hus- 
band and a home, and nine 
times out of ten she gets it. 
With these BuSci women 
it’ll be ten out of ten." 

“You may be right, of 



68 



by Edward E. Smith & E. Everett Evans 




course, but it sounds kind of 
far-fetched to me.” 

“Wait and see, chum/* San- 
dra said, with a laugh. 

Hilton made his announce- 
ment and everyone moved 
aground the next day. No 
one, however, had elected to 
live alone. Almost everyone 
had chosen to double up; the 
most noteworthy exceptions 
being twelve laboratory girls 
who had decided to keep on 
living together. However, 
they now had a twenty-room 
house instead, of a one-room 
dormitory to live in, and a 
staff of twenty Oman girls to 
help them do it. 

Hilton had suggested that 
Temple and Teddy, whose 
house was only a hundred 
yards or so from the Hilton- 
Karns bungalow, should have 
supper and spend the first 
evening with them; but the 
girls had knocked that idea 
flat. Much better, they 
thought,' to let things ride as 
nearly as possible exactly as 
they had been aboard the 
Perseus. 

“A little smooching now 
and then, on the Q strictly T, 
but that's all, darling. That's 
positively all," Temple had 
said, after a highly satisfac- 
tory ten minutes alone with 
him in her own gloriously 
private room, and that was 
the way it had to be. 

Hence it was a stag inspec- 
tion that Hilton ana Karns 
made of their new home. It 
was very long, very wide, and 



for its size very low. Four of 
its five rooms were merely 
adjuncts to its tremendous 
1 i v i n g-room. There was a 
huge fireplace at each end of 
this room, in each of which a 
fire of four-foot-long fir 
cordwood crackled and 
snapped. There was a great 
hi-fi tri-di, with over a hun- 
dred tapes, all new. 

"Yes, sirs," Larry and Jav- 
vy spoke in unison. “The 
players and singers who en- 
tertained the Masters of old 
have gone back to work. They 
will also, of course, appear in 
person whenever and wher- 
ever you wish." 

B OTH men looked around 
the vast room and Karns 
said : “All the comforts of 
home and a couple of bucks’ 
worth besides. Wall-to-wall 
carpeting an inch and a half 
thick. A grand piano. Easy 
chairs and loafers and daven- 
ports. Very fine reproduc- 
tions of our favorite paint- 
ings. .and statuary." 

“You said it, brother." Hil- 
ton was bending over a group 
in bronze. “If I didn’t know 
better, I’d swear this is the 
original deHaven ‘Dance of 
the Nymphs’.” 

Karns had marched up to 
and was examining minutely 
a two-by-three-foot painting, 
in a heavy gold frame, of a 
gorgeously a u b u r n-haired 
nude. “Reproduction, hell ! 
This is a duplicate! Law- 
rence’s ‘Innocent’ is worth 



MASTERS OF SPACE 




twenty million wogs and it’s 
sealed behind quad armor- 
glass in Prime Art — but I'll 
bet wogs to wiggles the 
Prime Curator himself, with 
all his apparatus, couldn't tell 
this one from his!" 

“I wouldn't take even one 
wiggle's worth of that. And 
this ‘Laughing Cavalier' and 
this ‘Toledo' are twice as old 
and twice as fabulousy valu- 
able." 

“And there are my own golf 
clubs. ." 

“Excuse us, sirs," the 
Omans said, “These things 
were simple because they 
could be induced in your 
minds. But the matter of a 
staff could not, nor what 
you . would like to eat for 
supper, and it is growing 
late." 

“Staff? What the hell has 
the staff got to do with ..." 

“House- staff, they mean," 
Karns said. “We don't need 
much of anybody, boys. Some- 
body to keep the place ship- 
shape, is all. Or, as a de luxe 
touch, how about a waitress? 
One housekeeper and one 
waitress. That’ll be finer." 

“Very well, sirs. There is 
one other matter. It has trou- 
bled us that we have not been 
able to read in your minds the 
logical datum that they 
should in fact simulate Doc- 
tor Bells and Doctor Blake?" 

“Huh?” Both men gasped 
— and then both exploded 
like one twelve-inch length of 
primacord, 

70 



W HILE the Omans could 
not understand this 
purely Terran reasoning, they 
accepted the decision without 
a demurring thought. “Who, 
then, are the two its to sim- 
ulate?" 

“No stipulation; roll your 
own," Hilton said, and 
glanced at Karns. “None of 
these Oman women are really 
hard on the eyes." 

“Check. Anybody who 
wouldn’t call any one of 'em 
a slurpy dish needs a new set 
of optic nerves." 

“In that case," the Omans 
said, “no delay at all will be 
necessary, as we can make do 
with one temporarily. The 
Sory, no longer Sora, who has 
not been glad since the Tuly 
replaced it, is now in your 
kitchen. It comes." 

A woman came in and stood 
quietly in front of the two 
men, the wafted air carrying 
from her clear, smooth skin 
a faint but unmistakable 
fragrance of Idaho mountain 
syringa. She was radiantly 
happy; her bright, deep-green 
eyes went from man to man. 

“You wish, sirs, to give me 
your orders verbally. And yes, 
you may order fresh, whole, 
not-canned hens' eggs." 

“I certainly will, then; I 
haven’t had a fried egg since 
we left Terra. But... Larry 
said . you ^en’t Sory !" 

“Oh, but I am, sir." 
^|SCarns had been staring at 
her, eyes popping. “Holy 
Saint Patrick ! Talk about 



by Edward' E. Smith & E. Everett Event 




simulation, Jarvc! They’ve 
made her over into Law- 
rence’s ‘Innocent’ — exact to 
twenty decimals!” 

“You’re so right.” Hilton’s 
eyes went, half a dozen times, 
from the form of flesh to the 
painting and back. “That 
must have been a terrific 
job.” 

“Oh, no. It was quite sim- 
ple, really,” Sory said, “since 
the brain was not involved. I 
merely reddened my hair and 
lengthened it, made my eyes 
to be green, changed my face 
a little, pulled myself in a lit- 
tle around here. Her beau- 
tifully-m a n i c u r e d hands 
swept the full circle of her 
waistline, then continued to 
demonstrate appropriately 
the rest of her speech: 

“...and pushed me out a 
little up here and tapered my 
legs a little more — made them 
a little larger and rounder 
here at my hips and thighs 
and a little smaller toward 
and at my ankles. Oh, yes, 
and made my feet and hands 
a little smaller. That’s all. I 
thought the Doctor Karns 
would like me a little better 
this way.” 

{{V^OU can broadcast that 
over the P-A system at 
high noon.” Karns was still 
staring. “ ‘That’s all,’ she 
says. But you didn’t have 
time to ... ” 

“Oh, I did it day before 
yesterday. As soon as Jawy^ 
materialized the ‘Innocent’ 



and I knew it to be your fa- 
vorite art.” 

“But damn it, we hadn’t 
even thought of having you 
here then!” 

“But I had; sir. I fully in- 
tended to serve, one way or 
another, in this your home. 
But of course I had no idea 
I would ever have such an 
honor as actually waiting on 
you at your table. Will you 
please give me your orders, 
sirs, besides the eggs? You 
wish the eggs fried in butter 
— three of them apiece — and 
sunny side up.” 

“Uh-huh, with ham,” Hilton 
said. “I’ll start with a jumbo 
shrimp cocktail. Horseradish 
and ketchup sauce; heavy on 
the horseradish.” 

“Same for me,” Karns said, 
“but only half as much horse- 
radish.” 

“And for the rest of it,” 
Hilton went on, “hashed- 
brown potatoes and buttered 
toast — plenty of extra butter 
— strong coffee from first to 
last. Whipping cream tfnd sug- 
ar on the side. For dessert, 
apple pie a la mode** 

“You make me drool, chief. 
Play that for me, please, In- 
nocent, all the way.” 

“Oh? You are — you, per- 
sonally, yourself, sir? — re- 
naming me ‘Innocent’?” 

“If you’ll sit still for it, 
yes.” 

“That is an incredible hon- 
or, sir. Simply unbelievable. 
I thank you ! I thank you !” 
Radiating happiness, she 



MASTERS OF SPACE 



71 




dashed away toward the 
kitchen. 

W HEN the two men were 
full of food, they 
strolled over to a davenport 
facing the fire. As they sat 
down, Innocent entered the 
room, carrying a tall, dewy 
mint julep on a tray. She was 
followed by another female 
figure bearing a bottle of 
avignognac and the appurten- 
ances which are its due — and 
at the first full sight of that 
figure Hilton stopped breath- 
ing for fifteen seconds. 

Her hair was very thick, in- 
tensely black and long, cut 
squarely off just below the 
lowest points of her shoulder 
blades. Heavy brows and long 
lashes — eyes too— were all 
intensely, vividly black. Her 
skin was tanned to a deep and 
glowing almost-but-not-quite- 
brown. 

"Murchison’s Dark Lady !” 
Hilton gasped. "Larry! 
You’ve — we’ve — Tve got that 
painting here?” 

"Oh, yes, sir.” The new- 
comer spoke before Larry 
could. "At the other end — 
your part — of the room. You 
will look now, sir, please?” 
Her voice was low, rich and 
as smooth as cream. 

Putting her tray down care- 
Ailly on the end-table, she led 
him toward the other fire- 
place. Past the piano, past the 
tri-di pit ; past a towering 
grillwork holding art trea- 
sures by the score. Over to 

72 



the left, against the wall, 
there was a big, business-like 
desk. On the wall, over the 
desk, hung the painting; a 
copy of which had been in 
Hilton’s room for over eight 
years. 

He stared at it for at least 
a minute. He glanced around: 
at the other priceless dupli- 
cates so prodigally present, 
at his own guns arrayed above 
the mantel and on each side 
of the fireplace. Then, with- 
out a word, he started back to 
join Karns. She walked 
springily beside him. 

"What’s your name. Miss?” 
he asked, finally. 

"I haven’t earned any as 
yet, sir. My number is...” 
"Never mind that. Your 
name is ’Dark Lady’.” 

"Oh, thank you, sir; that is 
truly wonderful!” And Dark 
Lady sat cross-legged on the 
rug at Hilton’s feet and bus- 
ied herself with the esoteric 
rites of Old Avignon. 

Hilton took a deep inhala- 
tion and a small sip, then 
stared at Karns. Karns, over 
the rim of his glass, stared 
back. 

"I can see where this would 
be habit-f o r m i n g,” Hilton 
said, "and very deadly. JEx- 
tremely deadly.” 

"Every wish granted. Sur- 
rounded by all this.” Karns 
swept his arm through three- 
quarters of a circle. "Waited 
on hand and foot by powerful 
men and by the materializa- 
tions of the dreams of the 



fry Edward E. Smith A C. Everett Evans 




greatest, finest artists who 
ever lived. Fatal? I don’t 
know. 

<<1E^IY solid hope is that we 
never have to find out. 
And when you add in Inno- 
cent and Dark Lady... They 
look to be about seventeen, 
but the thought that they’re 
older than the hills of Rome 
and powered by everlasting 
atomic engines — ” He broke 
off suddenly and blushed. 
“Excuse me, please, girls. I 
know better than to talk 
about people that way, right 
in front of them; I really do.” 
“Do you really think we’re 
people ?” Innocent and Dark 
Lady squealed, as one. 

That set Hilton back onto 
his heels. “I don’t know... 
I’ve wondered. Are you?” 
Both girls, silent, looked at 
Larry. 

“We don’t know, either,” 
Larry said. “At first, of 
course, there were crude, non- 
thinking machines. But when 
the Guide attained its present 
status, the Masters them- 
selves could not agree. They 
divided about half and half 
on the point. They, never did 
settle it any closer than that.” 
“I certainly won’t try to, 
then. But for my money, you 
are people,” Hilton said, and 
Karns agreed. 

That, of course, touched off 
a near-riot of joy ; after which 
the two men made an inch-by- 
inch study of their tremen- 
dous living-room. Then, long 



after bedtime, Larry and Dark 
Lady escorted Hilton to his 
bedroom. 

“Do you mind, sir, if we 
sleep on the floor at the sides 
of your bed?” Larry asked. 
“Or must we go out into the 
hall?” 

“Sleep? I didn’t know you 
could sleep.” 

“It is not essential. How- 
ever, when round-the-clock 
work is not necessary, and we 
have opportunity to sleep 
near a human being, we de- 
rive a great deal of pleasure 
and satisfaction from it. You 
see, sir, we also serve during 
sleep.” 

“Okay, I’ll try anything 
once. Sleep wherever you 
please.” 

Hilton began to peel, but 
before he had his shirt off 
both Larry and Dark Lady 
were stretched out flat, sound 
asleep, one almost under each 
edge of his bed. He slid in be- 
tween the sheets — it was the 
most comfortable bed he had 
ever slept in — and went to 
sleep as though sandbagged. 

He had time to wonder fog- 
gily whether the Omans were 
in fact helping him go to 
s 1 e e p — and then he was 
asleep. 

A month passed. Eight cou- 
ples had married, the 
Navy chaplain officiating — 
in the Perseus, of course, 
since the warship was, always 
and everywhere, an integral 
part of Terra.

Sandra had dropped in one 
evening to see Hilton about a 
bit of business. She was now 
sitting, long dancer’s legs 
out-stretched toward the fire, 
with a cigarette in her left 
hand and a tall, cold drink on 
a coaster at her right. 

“This is a wonderful room, 
Jarvis. It’d be perfect if it 
weren’t quite so... so man- 
nish.’’ 

“What do you expect of 
Bachelors’ Hall — a boudoir? 
Don’t tell me you’re going 
domestic, Sandy, just because 
you’ve got a house?” 

“Not just that, no. But of 
course it helped it along.” 

“Alex is a mighty good 
man. One of the finest I have 
ever known.” 

She eyed him for a moment 
in silence. “Jarvis Hilton, you 
are one of the keenest, most 
intelligent men who ever 
lived. And yet...” She broke 
off and studied him for a 
good half minute. “Say, if I 
let my hair clear down, will 
you?” 

“Scout’s Oath. That ‘and 
yet’ requires elucidation at 
any cost.” 

“I know. But first, yes, it’s 
Alex. I never would have be- 
lieved that any man ever born 
could hit me so hard. Soon. I 
didn’t want to be the first, 
but I won’t be anywhere near 
the last. But tell gpe. You 
were really in love with Tem- 
ple, weren’t you* ^when I 
asked you?” 

“Yes.” 



“Ha! You are letting your 
hair down! That makes me 
feel better.” 

“Huh? Why should it?” 

“It elucidates the ‘and yet* 
no end. You were insulated 
from all other female charms 
by ye brazen Bells. You see, 
most of us assistants made a 
kind of game out of seeing 
which of us could make you 
break the Executives’ Code. 
And none of us made it. Ted- 
dy and Temple said you 
didn’t know what was going 
on ; Bev and I said nobody as 
smart as you are could pos- 
sibly be that stupid.” 

“You aren’t the type to leak 
or name names — oh, I see. 
You are merely reporting a 
conversation. The game had 
interested, but non-partici- 
pating, observers. Temple 
and Teddy, at least.” 

“At least,” she agreed. “But 
damn it, you aren't stupid. 
There isn’t a stupid bone in 
your head. So it must be love. 
And if so, what about mar- 
riage? Why don’t you and 
Temple make it a double with 
Alex and me?” 

“That’s the most cogent 
thought you ever had, but set- 
ting the date is the bride’s 
business.” He glanced at his 
Oman wristwatch. “It’s early 
yet ; let’s skip over. I wouldn’t 
mind seeing her a minute or 
two.” 

“Thy statement r i n g e t h 
with truth, friend. Bill’s there 
with Teddy?” 

“I imagine so.”

"So we’ll talk to thorn 
about making it a triple. Oh, 
nice — let’s go!” 

They left the house and, 
her hand tucked under his el- 
bow, walked up the street. 

N EXT morning, on her 
way to the Hall of Rec- 
ords, Sandra stopped off as 
usual at the office. The 
Omans were all standing mo- 
tionless. Hilton was leaning 
far back in his chair, feet on 
desk, hands clasped behind 
head, eyes closed. Knowing 
what that meant, she turned 
and started back out on tip- 
toe. 

However, he had heard her. 
"Can you spare a couple of 
minutes to think at me, 
Sandy?” 

"Minutes or hours, chief.” 
Tuly placed a chair for her 
and she sat down, facing him 
across his desk. 

"Thanks, gal. This time it’s 
the' Stretts. Sawtelle’s been 
having nightmares, you know, 
ever since we emerged, about 
being attacked, and I’ve been 
pooh-poohing the idea. But 
now it’s a statistic that the 
soup is getting thicker, and I 
can’t figure out why. Why in 
all the hells of space should 
a stasis that has lasted for 
over a quarter of a million 
years be broken at this exact 
time? The only possible ex- 
planation is that we caused 
th$£ break. And any way I 
look at that concept, it’s plain 
idiocy.” 



Both were silent for min- 
utes; and then it was demon- 
strated again that Terra’s Ad- 
visory Board had done better 
than it knew in choosing San- 
dra Cummings to be Jarvis 
Hilton’s working mate. 

"We did cause it, Jarve,” 
she said, finally. "They knew 
we were coming, even before 
we got to Fuel Bin. They 
knew we were human and 
tried to wipe out the Omans 
before we got there. Preven- 
tive warfare, you know.” 
"They couldn’t have 
known!” he snorted. "Strett 
detectors are no better than 
Oman, and you know what 
Sam Bryant had to say about 

them. ” 

"I know.” Sandra grinned 
appreciatively. "It’s becoming 
a classic. But it couldn’t have 
been any other way. Besides, 
I know they did.” 

He stared at her helplessly, 
then swung on Larry. "Does 
that make sense to you?” 
"Yes, sir. The Stretts could 
peyondire as well as the old 
Masters could, and they un- 
doubtedly still can and do.” 
"Okay, it does make sense, 

then. ” He absented himself in 

thought, then came to life 
with a snap. "Okay! The next 
thing on the agenda is a 
crash-priority try at a pey- 
ondix team. Tuly, you organ- 
ized a team to generate sath- 
ura. Can you do the same for 
peyondipj i* 

"If we can find the ingredi- 
ents, yes, sir.”

UT had a hunch. Larry , 
-■•please ask Teddy Blake’s 
Oman to bring her in 
here. .” 

“I'll be running along, 
then.” Sandra started to get 
up. 

“I hope to kiss a green pig 
you won’t!” Hilton snapped. 
“You’re one of the biggest 
wheels. Larry, we’ll want 
Temple Bells and Beverly 
Bell — for a start.” 

“C h i e f, you positively 
amaze me,” Sandra said then. 
“Every time you get one of 
these attacks of genius— or 
whatever it is — you have me 
gasping like a fish. Just what 
can you possibly want of Bev 
Bell?” 

“Whatever it was that en- 
abled her to hit the target 
against odds of almost in- 
finity to one; not just once, 
but time after time. By defi- 
nition, intuition. What quality 
did you use just now in get- 
ting me off the hook? Intui- 
tion. What makes Teddy 
Blake such an unerring per- 
former? Intuition again. My 
hunches — they’re intuition, 
too. Intuition, hell ! Labels — 
based on utterly abysmal 
damned dumb ignorance of 
our own basic frames of ref- 
erence. Do you think those 
four kinds of intuition are 
alike, by seven thousand rows 
of apple trees?” 

“Of course not. I see what 
you’re g e 1 1 i n g at. Oh ! 
This’ll be fun!” 

The others came in and, 



one by one, Tuly examined 
each of the four women and 
the man. Each felt the prob- 
ing, questioning feelers of her 
thought prying into the deep- 
est recesses of his mind. 

“There is not quite enough 
of each of three components, 
all of which are usually asso- 
ciated with the male. You, 
sir, have much of each, but 
not enough. I know your men 
quite well, and I think we 
will need the doctors Kincaid 
and Karns and Poynter. But 
such deep probing is felt. 
Have I permission, sir?” 

“Yes. Tell ’em I said so.” 
Tuly scanned. “Yes, sir, we 
should have all three.” 

“Get ’em, Larry.” Then, in 
the pause that followed : 
“Sandy, remember yowling 
about too many sweeties on a 
team? What do you think of 
this business of all sweeties?” 
“All that proves is that no- 
body can be wrong all the 
time,” she replied flippantly. 

The three men arrived and 
were instructed. Tuly said: 
“The great trouble is that 
each of you must use a por- 
tion of your mind that you do 
not know you have. You, this 
one. You, that one.” Tuly 
probed mercilessly; so poig- 
nantly that each in turn 
flinched under brand-new and 
almost unbearable pain. 
“With you. Doctor Hilton, it 
will be by far the worst. For 
you must learn to use almost 
all the portions of both your 
minds, the conscious and the 



76

unconscious. This must be, 
because you are the actual 
peyondixer. The others mere- 
ly supply energies in which 
you yourself are deficient. 
Are you ready for a terrible 
shock, sir?” 

“Shoot.” 

H E thought for a second 
that he had been shot ; 
that his brain had blown up. 

He couldn’t stand it — he 
knew he was going to die — he 
wished he could die — any- 
thing, anything whatever, to 
end this unbearable agony*. 
It ended. 

Writhing, white and sweat- 
ing, Hilton opened his eyes. 
“Ouch,” he remarked, conver- 
sationally. “What next?” 

“You will seize hold of the 
energies your friends offer. 
You will bind them to yours 
and shape the whole into a 
dimensionless sphere of pure, 
controlled, dirigible energy. 
And, as well as being the 
binding force, the cohesive- 
ness, you must also be the 
captain and the pilot and the 
astrogator and the ultimately 
complex computer itself.” 
“But how can I... Okay, 
damn it. I will!" 

“Of course you will, sir. 
Remember also that once the 
joinings are made I can be of 
very little more assistance, 
for my peyondix is as noth- 
ing compared to that of your 
fusion of eight. Now, to as- 
semble the energies and join 



them you will, all together, 
deny the existence of the sum 
total of reality as you know 
it. Distance does rtot exist— 
every point in the reachable 
universe coincides with every 
other point and that common 
point is the focus of your at- 
tention. You can be and actu- 
ally are anywhere you please 
or everywhere at once. Time 
does not exist. Space does not 
exist. There is no such thing 
as opacity; everything is per- 
fectly transparent, yet every 
molecule of substance is per- 
ceptible in its relationship to 
every other molecule in the 
cosmos. Senses do not exist. 
Sight, hearing, taste, touch, 
smell, sathura, endovix — all 
are parts of the one great 
sense of peyondix. I am guid- 
ing each of you seven — clos- 
er! Tighter! There! Seize it, 
sir — and when you work the 
Stretts you must fix it clear- 
ly that time does not exist. 
You must work in millionths 
of microseconds instead of in 
minutes, for they have minds 
of tremendous power. Reality 
does not exist ! Compress it 
more, sir. Tighter! Smaller! 
Rounder! There! Hold it! 
Reality does not exist — dis- 
tance does not exist — all pos- 
sible points are . Wonder- 
ful!” 

Tuly screamed the word 
and the thought: “Good-by! 
Good luck!”

T HE machine had stood 
there a long time. It was 
several hundred feet long and 
could run on a thimbleful of 
earth or water. Complete in 
itself, the machine drew ma- 
terial from the surrounding 
landscape, transmuting matter 
to its special purposes. It 
needed sugar, salt, water and 
many other things but never 
failed to have them. It was 
still working. And at the de- 
livery end, where the packag- 
ing devices had been broken 
down, it turned out a steady 
turgid stream on the ground 
6f pink-striped, twisting taf- 
fy- 

Once the whole vast desert 
area had been filled with such 
devices, producing all the 
varied needs of a very need- 
ful human race. But there had 
been no machine to produce 
peace. The crossing s.hock 
waves of fused hydrogen had 
destroyed the machine by the 

78

tens of thousands, along with 
all the automatic shipping 
lines, leaving only, in the 
quirk of a pressure cross-pat- 
tern, an undisturbed taffy- 
making machine, oozing its 
special lava on the plateau 
floor. 

It had been working seven 
and a half million years. 

It continued to repair it- 
self, as if a child of the race 
that had started all this would 
come by it at any moment to 
tip an eager pinky in the still- 
warm taffy to taste its tangy 
sweetness. But there were no 
human beings. There had 
been none since the day when 
the packager collapsed, at the 
edge of the total-evaporation 
zone. 

C RENO set a few of his 
legs on the edge of the 
glassy, weathered ridge and 
gazed over the plateau. Harta, 
next to him, trembled as she 




adjusted to the strange hard- 
ness of these four dimensions. 
“Being is a thin thing here/’ 
she said. 

“Thin, yes,” Creno smiled. 
“An almost dead world. But 
there is a mystery in that al- 
most to make the journey 
worth the coming.” 

“What mystery?” But 
Creno was of the wisest on 
the home planet and her sense 
feelers scanned once more to 
find what he must mean. “I 
do feel it! Everything dead 
but that one great mental 
thing moving, and a four-di- 
mensional stream coming out 
in the vibrations of this 
world !” 

“I have been watching it,” 
said Creno. “What kind of 
life can that be? You are a 
sharp sensor, Harta. Focus to 
it.” 

She strained and then re- 
laxed, speaking : “The cir- 

cuits are closed into them- 
selves. It learns nothing from 
outside itself except to move 
and extend its metal feelers 
for food. Soil is its food. Soil 
is its energy. Soil is its be- 
ing.” 

“Can it be alive?” 

“It is alive.” 

All his legs rested now in a 
row along the ridge. He too 
was relaxed as one mystery 
disappeared “I feel your 
feelings, but the thing is not 
alive. It is a machine.” 

“I do not .understand. A 
machine in tfie* middle of a 
dead world?” 

“Whether wt understand 



why or not, that is what it is 
— a machine.” 

Harta throbbed with excite- 
ment. How could Creno be 
wrong? He knew everything 
as soon as the facts were in 
his mind. Yet here now were 
living things crawling toward 
the machine, just like the ex- 
crescence at one end but in 
no way a part of it! The feel- 
ing of willed effort as they 
crawled slowly toward it, 
white and pink striped, reach- 
ing grasping feelers into the 
turgid product, taking it in, 
then rising on easing legs as 
the food spread within them. 

“There are living creatures 
here !” Creno pondered. “I 
feel your messages. Twenty, 
thirty — a horde is crawling 
from that mountain toward 
it.” 

“Four thousand three hun- 
dred and ninety-one,” said 
Harta. She concentrated. 
“There are three thousand 
and five more in the moun- 
tain caves, waiting to come 
out as the others return.” 

T HEY came in groups of 
about a hundred, pulling 
themselves slowly toward the 
edges of the great sticky lake 
that lay within the vaster 
area where the pink matter 
dried and crumbled into the 
strong breeze. Some were 
smaller than others, offspring 
who were nudged along by 
their , elders. But these small 
creatures were the ones who 
scampered most of all after 
they had fed. Joyously they 

79 



SWEET THEIR BLOOD AND STICKY, 




danced back toward the 
mountain. A few of medium 
height went back in pairs, 
firm taffy fingers inter- 
twined in each other. 

“They mate,” said Creno. 
“It is their custom.” 

“How tiring they are,” said 
Harta. “I have lost interest. 
We have seen t h i r t y-one 
worlds with such customs and 
these creatures are too simple 
to be interesting. Let us go 
home or try some other sys- 
tem.” 

“Not yet,” Creno insisted. 
“We passed through the 
ocean and surveyed the lands 
of this tiny planet. Nowhere 
else has there been the tiniest 
unit of life. Why at this one 
spot should something ex- 
ist?” 

“But we have several par- 
allel situations,” Harta pro- 
tested. “They were colonies 
landed in one spot by the civi- 
lization of another planet. 
They landed here with their 
feeder machine. And that is 
the explanation.” 

“Your mind does not func- 
tion well in a four-dimension 
continuum, Harta. You will 
need more training — ” 

“But these cases are rare, 
and, Creno — ” 

“I know they are rare, my 
child. But still they exist* 
You will have to learn even- 
tually, a little at a time. Now 
then, it is a rule of such limit- 
ed dimensional realms that 
the movement of matter and 
events from place to place is 
highly difficult. Certain com- 
80 



pacting procedures must be 
observed. To transport a 
machine this size across their 
space would have required 
enormous effort and an in- 
telligence they do not yet 
have. More than that, it would 
have been unnecessary. A 
smaller device would have 
supplied them with food. I 
am forced to conclude that — 
somehow — we are approach- 
ing this problem backwards.” 
“Backwards? You mean 
they made the machine here 
after they came?” 

He did not reply to that. 
“We must concentrate to- 
gether on thinking ourselves 
into their functioning in 
their manifold.” 

Harta followed his sugges- 
tion, and soon their thoughts 
were moving among and with- 
in the striped creatures. The 
insides of their bodies con- 
sisted of fundamentally the 
same taffy substance; but it 
had been modified by various 
organic structures. All, 
though, were built of the 
same fundamental units : 
elongated, thin cells which 
readily aligned themselves in 
semi-crystalline patterns. 

“Enoug h,” Creno said, 
“back to the hill.” 

Their rows of thin limbs 
rested on the ridge crest once 
more. “We have seen such 
cell crystals before,” she 
sighed. “The inefficiencies in 
such a poverty of dimen- 
sions! Do you still think we 
have looked at it backwards?” 
“Of course we have. They 

ALBERT a TEICHNCR 




did not bring the machine or 
make it — the machine made 
them !” 

“That is not possible, 
Creno, great as you are in 
these matters. We have never 
seen life created by a ma- 
chine before. No one ever 
has, from the millions of re- 
ports I have seen at home.” 
“Maybe we have and not 
known it. The life we have 
seen always evolved through 
enormous eons and we could 
not see its origins clearly in 
most cases. Here we are deal- 
ing with something that has 
taken comparatively little 
time.” He stopped, shocked 
that he, an elder, had said so 
much. “No, disregard such 
theories. You are still too 
young to bother with them. 
Here is the important thing — 
this machine was left by an 
earlier race that disappeared. 
Everything else was de- 
stroyed but it went right on 
producing its substance.” 
“The substance is not life.” 
“It is only four-dimension- 
al matter, right. But over a 
long enough time — you know 
this as well as I do— random 
factors will eventually pro- 
duce a life form. By some 
trick of radiation this pro- 
cess has been speeded up 
here. The substance the ma- 
chine produces has in turn 
produced life!” 

C RENO sensed with a trem- 
or some dangerous shift- 
ing in Harta’s consciousness. 
As an elder it was his duty 



to prevent a premature in- 
sight in the young. It had 
been a mistake to bring this 
up. He must go no further. 

It was not necessary. Harta 
took it up for him. 

“Then any substance pro- 
ducing life and modified by 
it c o u 1 d — if you go far 
enough back — be the product 
of a machine. But it would 
have taken so long to produce 
life that the original matter, 
that bore the direct imprint 
of the machine, would have 
disappeared.” 

“An error,” said Creno des- 
perately. “There is just this 
case.” 

“By the time these crea- 
tures have arrived at self- 
knowledge the machine will 
be gone. They will not know 
it ever existed, and — ” 

“That is all it means. There 
is just this one case. Now we 
must leave this unimportant 
example of minor dimen- 
sions !” 

He strained consciousness 
to a forward movement but 
Harta remained behind. He 
had to pull back. “Start,” he 
ordered. 

Her mind's obstinately fro- 
zen stance made him freeze 
too. He applied all his force 
to bring her back into con- 
trol, but she still held fast. 

“Something more is hidden 
from me. I will be back,” she 
said. And she disappeared 
from the ridge. 

He had never faced such a 
quandary before on a training 
trip with a younger one. If 

81 



SWEET THEIR BLOOD AND STICKY 




he went in pursuit he would 
find her ultimately — that .was 
in the nature of being older 
and wiser — but, if she revolt- 
ed against his pursuit, she 
could extend the time consid- 
erably. on this forsaken plan- 
et. And he wanted to get her 
away as soon as possible. 

The more time here the 
more chance that the awful 
truth would come to her be- 
fore her time. 

Hfc watched the growing 
waves of creatures flounder- 
ing toward the vast oozing 
puddle, which refilled itself 
as quickly as it was dimin- 
ished by them, and the reced- 
ing waves of those that had 
already fed. This, he could 
see, was an endless process. 
The whole life on the species 
moved in continuous systole- 
diastole around the machine. 

Soon he would have to go 
in search of her . 

But then she was back at 
his side, her being for this 
world once more solidified. 
She concentrated for a mo- 
ment on the pink-striped 
waves of rippling inward and 
outward around the great sus- 
taining pool, then communi- 
cated with him. 

“We can leave now. There 
is nothing more to see.” 

Something in her mind re- 
mained closed to hts, as the 
mind of younger never should 
be to older. But at least he 
could see with relief that the 
worst had not happened. The 
deeper knowledge had not ar- 
rived to her too early when it 
82 



could only hurt. All he found 
turned to him — as they reced- 
ed from this thin-manifold 
universe, then moved up the 
dimension ladder to their 
home level — was a surface of 
happiness. 

Suddenly, though, as they 
prepared for flight in that 
hyperspace all her joy was 
gone. 

“I saw it,” she said. "In my 
free and unrestricted spirit I 
moved deep into the sub- 
stance of that world, below all 
the total ruin, far below. And 
there whs a monstrous ma- 
chine, near the molten core, 
almost infinitely older than 
the feeding one far above it. 
And it, too, had been left in 
a stratum where all else was 
destroyed. I could see it had 
once produced the ooze from 
which came the life from 
which in turn come the beings 
by whom the machine above 
it was made. Maybe they, too, 
thought they were free and 
unrestricted !” 

He sighed for the bitter 
cost of knowledge. 

This one would no longer 
go forth in the joy of mere 
exploration, and he would no 
longer live vicariously in the 
happiness of another being's 
innocence. Now Harta, too, 
would be seekng the answer 
to the question of original 
creation, the answer that he. 
had not found in his journeys 
across a myriad worlds and 
dimensions. 

That no one had ever found.

'T'HE lightest element is hy- 
-■» drogen, the next lightest is 
helium. Next in line is the 
lightest solid. It's a metal, sil- 
very, soft enough to crease 
with a thumbnail, light 
enough to float like a ping- 
pong ball. 

It’s Lithium, and it’s a 
weird and wonderful worker. 
You've probably never en- 
countered it since about ten 
minutes ago. It helps lubri- 
cate the car, puts the zing in 
the bubbles in your Coke, lays 
that special gloss on your 
bathroom fixtures and helps 
make Vitamin A pills. 

It also has a lot to do with 
your future, or lack of it. 
Bombard an isotope of lithium 
(Li-6) with neutrons and you 
get triple-w eight hydrogen 
(tritium) which one may as- 
sume is what makes the hy- 
drogen bomb go bang. 

It was discovered in 1817 
but not much was done with 
it but for glazing chinaware 
until someone found out it 
would give more muscles to 
Edison batteries. In 1931 the 
physicists Cocroft and Wal- 
ton bombarded lithium with 
protons and came up with the 
very first experimental proof 
of Einstein's assertion that 
mass and energy are two 
forms of the same thing. 

Only 10% of pure lithium 
is the Li-6 used in fusion re- 



actions. The rest (Li-7) con- 
tinues to find more to do. It’s 
in face cream, and it's used 
in dehumidifiers. It adds ef- 
fectiveness to welding fluxes, 
medicines and synthetic rub- 
ber. 

The Atomic Energy Com- 
mission takes over quantities 
of this lithium hydroxides. 
The exact process is classi- 
fied, but it can be told that it's 
a snap compared with the mass 
diffusion used during the war 
to sort out U-235 from U-238. 
The AEC gets about 1% 
ounces of Li-6 from each 
pound of metallic lithium. 
For the rest, the Li-7, it has 
no use whatever, so it sells 
it back to its original suppli- 
er, who turns it over to indus- 
try. 

It looks very much as if the 
whole approach to atomic 
power which filled our minds 
and our newspapers — and our 
s-f-stories — dealing as it has 
with uranium and other heavy 
elements, will before long 
begin to look a little quaint. 
Light element nucleonics, and 
fusion power, may some day 
put uranium back where it 
was in a high-school textbook 
I once had: “Uranium," it 
said, “is a useless dense metal 
of value only in imparting a 
brownish-purple glaze to 
cheap crockery."

AT 

THE END 
OF 

ORBIT 



I 

T IBOR didn't see the thing. 

He was asleep, and dream- 
ing his inevitable painful 
dream. 

Only Joey was awake on 
deck, in the cool stillness be- 
fore dawn, when the meteor 
came flaming out of the sky 
above New Guinea. He 
watched it climb up the heav- 
ens until it passed directly 
overhead, routing the stars 
and throwing swift-moving 
shadows across the crowded 
deck. The harsh light outlined 
the bare rigging, the coiled 
ropes and air-hoses, the cop- 
per diving-helmets neatly 
snugged down for the night — 
even the low, pandanus-clad 
island half a mile away. As it 



passed into the southwest, out 
over the emptiness of the Pa- 
cific, it began to disintegrate. 

Incandescent globules broke 
off, burning and guttering in 
a trail of fire that stretched 
a quarter of the way across 
the sky. It was already dying 
when it raced out of sight. 
But Joey did not see its end. 
Still blazing furiously, it 
sank below the horizon, as if 
seeking to hurl itself into the 
face of the hidden sun. 

If the sight was spectacu- 
lar, the utter silence was un- 
nerving. Joey waited and 
waited and waited, but no 
sound came from the riven 
heavens. When, minutes later, 
there was a sudden splash 
from the sea, close at hand he 
gave an involuntary start of 



84 




surprise — then cursed himself 
for being frightened by a 
manta. (A mighty big one, 
though, to have made so much 
noise when it jumped.) There 
was no other sound, and pres- 
ently he went back to sleep. 

In his narrow bunk just aft 
of the air-compressor, Tibor 
heard nothing. He slept so 
soundly after his day’s work 
that he had little energy even 
for dreams. And when they 
came, they were not the 
dreams he wanted. In the 
hours of darkness, as his mind 
roamed back and forth across 
the past, it never came to rest 
amid memories of desire. He 
had women in Sydney and 
Brisbane and Darwin and 
Thursday Island — but none in 
his dreams. All that he ever 
remembered when he woke, in 
the fetid stillness of the cab- 
in, was the dust and fire and 
blood as the Russian tanks 
rolled into Budapest. His 
dreams were not of love, but 
only of hate. 

When Nick shook him back 
to consciousness, he was dodg- 
ing the guards on the Austri- 
an border. It took him a few 
seconds to make the ten-thou- 
sand-mile journey to the 
Great Barrier Reef. Then he 
yawned, kicked away the 
cockroaches that had been 
nibbling at his toes and 
heaved himself out of his 
bunk. 

Breakfast, of course, was 
the same as always — rice, tur- 
tle eg g s and bully-beef, 



washed down with strong, 
sweet tea. The best that could 
be said of Joey’s cooking was 
that there was plenty of it. 
Tibor was used to the mo- 
notonous diet. He made up for 
it, and for other deprivations, 
when he was back on the 
mainland. 

T HE sun had barely cleared 
the horizon when the dish- 
es were stacked in the tiny 
galley and the lugger got un- 
der way. Nick sounded cheer- 
ful as he took the wheel and 
headed out from the island. 
The old pearling-master had 
every right to be, for the 
patch of shell they were work- 
ing was the richest that Tibor 
had ever seen. With any luck, 
they would fill their hold in 
another day or two, and sail 
back to T.I. with half a ton 
of shell on board. And then, 
with a little more luck, he 
could give up this stinking, 
dangerous job and get back to 
civilisation. 

Not that he regretted any- 
thing. The Greek had treated 
him well, and he’d found some 
good stones when the shells 
were opened. But he under- 
stood now, after nine months 
on the Reef, why the number 
of white divers could be 
counted on the fingers of one 
hand. Japs and Kanakas and 
Islanders could take it — but 
damn few Europeans. 

The diesel coughed into si- 
lence and the Arafura coasted 
to rest. 



AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



85 




They were some two miles 
from the island, which lay low 
and green on the water, yet 
sharply divided from it by its 
narrow band of dazzling 
beach. It was no more than a 
nameless sand-bar that a tiny 
forest had managed to cap- 
ture. Its only inhabitants were 
the myriads of stupid mutton- 
birds that riddled the soft 
ground with their burrows, 
and made the night hideous 
with their banshee cries. 

There was little talk as the 
three divers dressed. Each 
man knew what to do, and 
wasted no time in doing it. 
As Tibor buttoned on his 
thick twill jacket, Blanco, his 
tender, rinsed out the face- 
plate with vinegar so that it 
would not become fogged. 
Then Tibor clambered down 
the rope ladder, while the 
heavy helmet and lead cor- 
selet were placed over his 
head. 

Apart from the jacket, 
whose padding spread the 
weight evenly over his shoul- 
ders, he was wearing his or- 
dinary clothes. In these warm 
waters there was no need for 
rubber suits. The helmet sim- 
ply acted as a tiny diving-bell 
held in position by its weight 
alone. In an emergency the 
wearer could — if he was lucky 
— duck out of it and swim 
back to the surface unham- 
pered. Tibor had seen this 
done. But he had no wish to 
try the experiment for him- 
self. 



Each time he stood on the 
last rung of the ladder, grip- 
ping his shell-bag with one 
hand and his safety line with 
the other, the same thought 
flashed through Tibor’s mind. 
He was leaving the world he 
knew; but was it for an hour 
— or was it forever? 

Down there on the seabed 
was wealth and death, and one 
could be sure of neither. The 
chances were that this would 
be another day of uneventful 
drudgery, as were most of the 
days in the pearl-diver's un- 
glamorous life. But Tibor had 
seen one of his mates die, 
when his air-hose tangled in 
the Arafura's prop. And he 
had watched the agony of an- 
other, as his body twisted 
with the bends. In the sea, 
nothing was ever safe or cer- 
tain. You took your chances 
with open eyes. 

And if you lost there was 
no point in whining. 

He stepped back from the 
ladder, and the world of sun 
and sky ceased to exist. Top- 
heavy with the weight of his 
helmet, he had to back-pedal 
furiously to keep his body 
upright. He could see noth- 
ing but a featureless blue mist 
as he sank towards the bot- 
tom. He hoped that Blanco 
would not play out the safety- 
line too quickly. Swallowing 
and snorting, he tried to clear 
his ears as the pressure 
mounteji. The right one 
“popped” quickly enough, but 
a piercing, intolerable pain 

ARTHUR C. CLARKE 



86 




grew rapidly in the left, which 
had bothered him for several 
days. He forced his hand up 
under the helmet, gripped his 
nose and blew with all his 
might. There was an abrupt, 
soundless explosion some- 
where inside his head, and the 
pain vanished instantly. He’d 
have no more trouble on this 
dive. 

T IBOR felt the bottom be- 
fore he saw it. 

Unable to bend over lest he 
risk flooding the open hel- 
met, his vision in the down- 
wards direction was very lim- 
ited. He could see around, but 
not immediately below. What 
he did see was reassuring in 
its drab monotony — a gently 
undulating, muddy plain that 
faded out of sight about ten 
feet ahead. A yard to his left 
a tiny fish was nibbling at a 
piece of coral the size and 
shape of a lady’s fan. That 
was all. There was no beauty, 
no underwater fairyland here. 
But there was money. That 
was what mattered. 

The safety line gave a gen- 
tle pull as the lugger started 
to drift downwind, moving 
broadside-on across the patch, 
and Tibor began to walk for- 
ward with the springy, slow- 
motion step forced on him by 
weightlessness and water re- 
sistance. As Number Two 
diver, he was working from 
the bow. Amidships was 
Stephen, still comparatively 
inexperienced, while at the 

AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



stern was the head diver, 
Billy. The three men seldom 
saw each other while they 
were working; each had his 
own lane to search as the 
Arafura drifted silently be- 
fore the wind. Only at the ex- 
tremes of their zigzags might 
they sometimes glimpse one 
another as dim shapes loom- 
ing through the mist. 

It needed a trained eye to 
spot the shells beneath their 
camouflage of algae and 
weeds, but often the molluscs 
betrayed themselves. When 
they felt the vibrations of the 
approaching diver, they would 
snap shut — and there would 
be a momentary, nacreous 
flicker in the gloom. Yet even 
then they sometimes escaped, 
for the moving ship might 
drag the diver past before he 
could collect the prize just 
out of reach. In the early days 
of his apprenticeship, Tabor 
had missed quite a few of the 
big silver-lips, any one of 
which might have contained 
some fabulous pearl. Or so he 
had imagined, before the 
glamor of the profession had 
worn off, and he realized that 
pearls were so rare that you 
might as well fbrget them. 

The most valuable stone 
he’d ever brought up had been 
sold for twenty pounds, and 
the shell he gathered on a 
good morning was worth more 
than that. If the industry had 
depended on gems instead of 
mother-of-pearl, it would have 
gone broke years ago. 



87 




There was no sense of time 
in this world of mist. You 
walked beneath the invisible, 
drifting ship, with the throb 
of the air compressor pound- 
ing in your ears, the green 
haze moving past your eyes. 
At long intervals you would 
spot a shell, wrench it from 
the sea-bed and drop it in 
your bag. If you were lucky, 
you might gather a couple of 
dozen on a single drift across 
the patch. On the other hand, 
you might not find a single 
one. 

You were alert for danger, 
but not worried by it. The 
real risks were simple, un- 
spectacular things like tan- 
gled air-hoses or safety-lines 
— not sharks, groupers or oc- 
topi. Sharks ran when they 
saw your air bubbles, and in 
all his hours of diving Tabor 
had seen just one octopus, 
every bit of two feet across. 
As for groupers — well, they 
were to be taken seriously, 
for they could swallow a diver 
at one gulp if they felt hun- 
gry enough. But there was lit- 
tle chance of meeting them 
on this flat and desolate plain. 
There were none of the coral 
caves in which they could 
make their homes. 

The shock would not have 
been so great, therefore, if 
this uniform, level grayness 
had not lulled him into a 
sense of security. 

At one moment he was 
walking steadily towards an 
unreachable wall of mist, that 



retreated as fast as he ap- 
proached. And then, without 
warning, his private night- 
mare was looming above him. 

II 

T IBOR hated spiders, and 
there was a certain crea- 
ture in the sea that seemed 
deliberately contrived to take 
advantage of that phobia. He 
had never met one, and his 
mind had always shied away 
from the thought of such an 
encounter, but Tibor knew 
that the Japanese spider crab 
can span twelve feet across its 
spindly legs. That it was 
harmless mattered not in the 
least. A spider as big as a man 
simply had no right to exist. 

As soon as he saw that cage 
of slender, jointed limbs 
emerge from the all-encom- 
passing grayness, Tibor began 
to scream with uncontrollable 
terror. He never remembered 
jerking his safety line, but 
Blanco reacted with the in- 
stantaneous perception of the 
ideal tender. His helmet still 
echoing to his screams, Tibor 
felt himself snatched from the 
sea-bed, lifted towards light 
and air — and sanity. As he 
swept upwards, he saw both 
the* strangeness and the ab- 
surdity of his mistake, and re- 
gained a measure of control. 
But he was still trembling so 
violently when Blanco lifted 
off his helmet that it was 
some time before he could 
speak. 



88

"What the hell's going on 
here?" demanded Nick. "Eve- 
ryone knocking off work 
early?" 

It was then that Tibor re- 
alized that he was not the 
first to come up. Stephen was 
sitting amidships, smoking a 
cigarette and looking com- 
pletely unconcerned. The 
stern diver, doubtless wonder- 
ing what had happened, was 
being hauled up willy-nilly by 
his tender, since the Arafura 
had come to rest and all op- 
erations had been suspended 
until the trouble was resolved. 

"There’s some kind of 
wreck down there," said Ti- 
bor. "I ran right into it. All 
I could see were a lot of wires 
and rods." 

To his annoyance and self- 
contempt, the memory set him 
trembling again. 

"Don’t see why that should 
give you the shakes," grum- 
bled Nick. Nor could Tibor — 
here on this sun-drenched 
deck. It was impossible to ex- 
plain how a harmless shape 
glimpsed through the mist 
could set one’s whole mind 
jangling with terror. 

"I nearly got hung up on 
it," he lied. "Blanco pulled me 
clear just in time." 

"Hmm," said Nick, obvious- 
ly not convinced. “Anyway, it 
ain’t a ship." He gestured to- 
wards the midships diver. 
"Steve ran into a mess of 
ropes and cloth — like thick 
nylon, he says. Sounds like 
some kind of parachute." The 

AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



old Greek stared in disgust at 
the soggy stump of his cigar, 
then flicked it overboard. 
"Soon as Billy’s up, we’ll go 
back and take a look. Might 
be worth something — remem- 
ber what happened to Jo 
Chambers.” 

T IBOR remembered; the 
story was famous the 
length of the Great Barrier 
Reef. Jo had been a lone-wolf 
fisherman who, in the last 
months of the War, had spot- 
ted a DC-3 lying in shallow 
water a few miles off the 
Queensland coast. After prod- 
igies of single-handed sal- 
vage, he had broken into the 
fuselage and started unload- 
ing boxes of taps and dies, 
perfectly protected by their 
greased wrappings. For a 
while he had run a flourish- 
ing import business, but when 
the police caught up with him 
he reluctantly revealed his 
source of supply. Australian 
cops can be very persuasive. 

And it was then, after weeks 
and weeks of backbreaking 
underwater work, that Jo dis- 
covered what his DC-3 had 
been carrying besides the 
miserable few thousand dol- 
lars’ worth of tools he had 
been flogging to garages and 
workshops on the mainland. 

The big wooden crates he’d 
never got round to opening 
held a week’s payroll for the 
U.S. Pacific Forces. 

No such luck here, thought 
Tibor as he sank over the side 

89 




again. But the aircraft — or 
whatever it was — might con- 
tain valuable instruments, and 
there could be a reward for 
its discovery. Besides, he 
owed it to himself. He want- 
ed to see exactly what it was 
that had given him such a 
fright. 

Ten minutes later, he knew 
it was no aircraft. It was the 
wrong shape, and it was much 
too small — only about twenty 
feet long and half that in 
width. Here and there on the 
gently-tapering body were 
access hatches and tiny ports 
through which unknown in- 
struments peered at the world. 
It seemed unharmed, though 
one end had been fused as if 
by . terrific heat. From the 
other sprouted a tangle of 
antennae, all of them broken 
or bent by the impact with 
the water. Even now, they 
bore an incredible resem- 
blance to the legs of a giant 
insect. 

Tibor was no fool. He 
guessed at once what the 
thing was. 

Only one problem remained, 
and he solved that with little 
difficulty. Though they had 
been partly charred away by 
heat, stenciled words could 
still be read on some of the 
hatch-covers. The letters were 
Cyrillic, and Tibor knew { 
enough Russian to pick out 
references to electrical sup- 
plies and pressurizing sys- 
tems. 



“So they’ve lost a sputnik/' 
he told himself with satisfac- 
tion. 

He . could imagine what had 
happened. The thing had 
come down too fast, and in the 
wrong place. Around one end 
were the tattered remnants of 
flotation bags; they had burst 
under the impact, and the ve- 
hicle had sunk like a stone. 

The Arafura's crew would 
have to apologize to Joey. He 
hadn’t been drinking grog. 
What he’d seen burning 
across the stars must have 
been the rocket carrier, sep- 
arated from its payload and 
falling back unchecked into 
the Earth’s atmosphere. 

pOR a long time Tibor hov- 
*ered on the sea-bed, knees 
bent in the diver’s crouch, as 
he regarded this space crea- 
ture now trapped in an alien 
element. His mind was full of 
half-formed plans, but none 
had yet come clearly into fo- 
cus. 

He no longer cared about 
salvage money. Much more 
important were the prospects 
of revenge. 

Here was one of the proud- 
est creations of Soviet tech- 
nology — and Szabo Tibor, late 
of Budapest, was the only 
man on earth who knew. 

There must be some way of 
Exploiting the situation — of 
doing harm to the country and 
the cause he now hated with 
such smoldering intensity. In 
his waking hours, he was sel- 



90 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 




dom conscious of that hate. 
Still less did he ever stop to 
analyze its real cause. Here 
in this lonely world of sea 
and sky, of steaming man- 
grove swamps and dazzling 
coral strands, there was noth- 
ing to recall the past. Yet he 
could never escape it. And 
sometimes the demons in his 
mind would awake, lashing 
him into a fury of rage or vi- 
cious, wanton destructiveness. 
So far he had been lucky; he 
had not killed anyone. But 
some day. 

An anxious jerk from Blan- 
co interrupted his reveries of 
vengeance. 

He gave a reassuring signal 
to his tender, and started a 
closer examination of the cap- 
sule. What did it weigh? 
Could it be hoisted easily? 
There were many things he 
had to discover, before he 
could settle on any definite 
plans. 

He braced himself against 
the corrugated metal wall and 
pushed cautiously. There was 
a definite movement as the 
capsule rocked on the sea-bed. 
Maybe it could be lifted, even 
with the few pieces of tackle 
that the Arafura could mus- 
ter. It was probably lighter 
than it looked. 

Tibor pressed his helmet 
against a flat section of the 
hull, and listened intently. 

He had half expected to 
hear some mechanical noise, 
such as the whirring of elec- 
tric motors. Instead, there was 



utter silence. With the hilt 
of his knife, he rapped sharp- 
ly on the metal, trying to 
gauge its thickness and to lo- 
cate any weak spots. On the 
third try, he got results: but 
they were not what he had 
anticipated. 

In a furious, desperate tat- 
too, the capsule rapped back 
at him. 

Until this moment, Tibor 
had never dreamed that there 
might be someone inside. The 
capsule had seemed far too 
small. 

Then he realized that he 
had been thinking in terms of 
conventional aircraft. There 
was plenty of room here for 
a little pressure cabin in 
which a dedicated astronaut 
could spend a few cramped 
hours. 

As a kaleidoscope can 
change its pattern completely 
in a single moment, so the 
half-formed plans in Tibor’s 
mind dissolved and then crys- 
tallized into a new shape. Be- 
hind the thick glass of his 
helmet, he ran his tongue 
lightly across his lips. If Nick 
could have seen him now, he 
would have wondered — as he 
had sometimes done before — 
whether his Number Two 
diver was wholly sane. Gone 
were all thoughts of a remote 
and impersonal vengeance 
against something as abstract 
as a nation or a machine. 

Now it would be man to 
man*

ARTHUR C. CLARKE 




Ill 

{{TPOOK your time, didn’t 
A you?” said Nick. “What 
did you find?” 

“It’s Russian,” said Tibor. 
“Some kind of sputnik. If we 
can get a rope around it, I 
think we can lift it off the 
bottom. But it’s too heavy to 
get aboard.” 

Nick chewed thoughtfully 
on his eternal cigar. 

The pearling master was 
worried about a point that had 
not occurred to Tibor. If 
there were any salvage oper- 
ations round here, everyone 
would know where the Ara- 
fura had been drifting. When 
the news got back to Thurs- 
day Island, his private patch 
of shell would be cleaned out 
in no time. 

They’d have to keep quiet 
about the whole affair, or else 
haul the damn thing up them- 
selves and not say where 
they’d found it. Whatever 
happened, it looked like being 
more of a nuisance than it 
was worth. Nick, who shared 
most Australians’ profound 
suspicion of authority, had al- 
ready decided that all he’d get 
for his-trouble would be a nice 
letter of thanks. 

“The boys won’t go down,” 
he said. “They think it’s a 
bomb. Want to leave it alone.” 
“Tell ’em not to worry,” re- 
plied Tibor. “I’ll handle it.” 
He tried to keep his voice 
normal and unemotional, but 
this was too good to be true. 
AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



If the other divers heard the 
tapping from the capsule, his 
plans would have been frus- 
trated. 

He gestured to the island, 
green and lovely on the sky- 
line. 

“Only one thing we can do. 
If we can heave it a couple of 
feet off the bottom, we can 
run for the shore. Once we’re 
in shallow water, it won’t be 
too hard to haul it up on the 
beach. We can use the boats, 
and maybe get a block and 
tackle on one of those trees.” 

Nick considered the idea 
without much enthusiasm. He 
doubted if they could get the 
sputnik through the reef, 
even on the leeward side of 
the island. But he was all in 
favor of lugging it away from 
this patch of shell. They 
could always dump it some- 
where else, buoy the place and 
still get whatever credit was 
going. 

“Okay,” he said. “Down you 
go. That two-inch rope’s the 
strongest we’ve got — better 
take that. Don’t be all bloody 
day; we’ve lost enough time 
already.” 

Tibor had no intention of 
being all day. Six hours would 
be quite long enough. That 
was one of the first things he 
had learned, from the signals 
through the wall. 

It was a pity that he could 
not hear the Russian’s voice; 
but the Russian could hear 
him, and that was what really 
mattered. When he pressed 

93 




his helmet against the metal 
and shouted, most of his 
words got through. So far, it 
had been a friendly conversa- 
tion; Tibor had no intention 
of showing his hand until the 
right psychological moment. 

T HE first move had been 
to establish a code — one 
knock for “Yes/’ two for 
“No.” After that, it was 
merely a matter of framing 
suitable questions. Given 
time, there was no fact or idea 
that could not be communi- 
cated by means of these two 
signals. 

It would have been a much 
tougher job if Tibor had been 
forced to use his indifferent 
Russian. He had been pleased, 
but not surprised, to find that 
the trapped pilot understood 
English perfectly. 

There was air in the cap- 
sule for another five hours; 
the occupant "was uninjured ; 
yes, the Russians knew where 
it had come down. 

That last reply gave Tibor 
pause. Perhaps the pilot was 
lying, but it might very well 
be true. Although something 
had obviously gone wrong 
with the planned return to 
Earth, the tracking ships out 
in the Pacific must have lo- 
cated the impact point — with 
what accuracy, he could not 
guess. Still, did that matter? 
It might take them days to 
get here, even if they came 
racing straight into Australi- 

94 



an territorial waters without 
bothering to get permission 
from Canberra. He was mas- 
ter of the situation. The en- 
tire might of the U.S.S.R. 
could do nothing to interfere 
with his plans — until it was 
much too late. 

The heavy rope fell in coils 
on the sea-bed, stirring up a 
cloud of silt that drifted like 
smoke down the slow current. 
Now that the sun was higher 
in the sky, the underwater 
world was no longer wrapped 
in a gray, twilight gloom. The 
sea-bed was colorless but 
bright, and the boundary of 
vision was now almost fif- 
teen feet away. 

For the first time, Tibor 
could see the space-capsule in 
its entirety. It was such a 
peculiar-looking object, being 
designed for conditions be- 
yond all normal experience, 
that there was an eye-teasing 
wrongness about it. One 
searched in vain for a front 
or a rear. There was no way 
of telling in what direction 
it pointed as it sped along its 
orbit. 

Tibor pressed his helmet 
against the metal and shout- 
ed. 

“Fm back,” he called.* “Can 
you hear me?” 

Tap. 

“I’ve got a rope, and I’m 
going to tie it on to the para- 
chute cables. WeTe about 
three kilometers from an. is- 
land. As soon as we’ve made 
you fast we’ll head towards

it. We can’t lift you out of 
the water with the gear on the 
lugger, so we’ll try to get you 
up on the beach. You under- 
stand?” 

Tap. 

TT took only a few moments 
•“■to secure the rope; now he 
had better get clear before 
the Arafura started to lift. 

But there was something he 
had to do first 
“Hello!” he shouted. “I’ve 
fixed the rope. We’ll lift in 
a minute. D’you hear me?” 
Tap. 

“Then you can hear this too. 
You’ll never get there alive. 
I’ve fixed that as well.” 

Tap , tap. 

“You’ve got five hours to 
die. My brother took longer 
than that, when he ran into 
your mine field. You under- 
stand? I’m from Budapest! I 
hate you and your country 
and everything it stands for. 
You’ve taken my home, my 
family, made my people 
slaves. I wish I could see your 
face now! I wish I could 
watch you die, as I had to 
watch Theo. When you’re 
halfway to the island, this 
rope is going to break where 
I cut it. I’ll go down and fix 
another — and that’ll break, 
too. You can sit in there and 
wait for the bumps.” 

Tibor stopped abruptly, 
shaken and exhausted by the 
violer&e of his emotion. 

There was no room for logic 
or reason' in this orgasm of 

AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



hate. He did not pause to 
think, for he dared not. Yet 
somewhere far down inside 
his mind the real truth was 
burning its way up towards 
the light of consciousness. 

It was not the Russians he 
hated, for all that they had 
done. It was himself, for he 
had done more. 

The blood of Theo, and of 
ten thousand countrymen, was 
upon his own hands. No one 
could have been a better com- 
munist than he was, or have, 
more supinely believed the 
propaganda from Moscow. At 
school and college, he had 
been the first to hunt out and 
denounce “traitors” (how 
many had he sent to the labor 
camps or the A VO torture 
chambers?) When he had 
seen the truth, it was far, far 
too late. And even then he 
had not fought. He had run. 

He had run across the 
world, trying to escape his 
guilt; and the two drugs of 
danger and dissipation had 
helped him to forget the past. 
The only pleasure life gave 
him now were the loveless em- 
braces he sought so feverishly 
when he was on the mainland, 
and his present mode of ex- 
istence was proof that these 
were not enough. 

If he now had the power 
to deal out death, it was only 
because he had come here in 
search of it himself. 

There was no soui^^from 
the capsule. Its silence seemed 
contemptuous, mocking. An- 



95 




grily, Tibor banged against it 
with the hilt of his knife. 

“Did you hear me?” he 
shouted. “Did you hear me?” 

No answer. 

“Damn you! I know you're 
listening! If you don't an- 
swer, I'll hole you and let the 
water in !” 

He was sure that he could, 
with the sharp point of his 
knife. But that was the last 
thing he wanted to do; that 
would be too quick, too easy 
an ending. 

There was still no sound; 
maybe the Russian had faint- 
ed. Tibor hoped not, but there 
was no point in waiting any 
longer. He gave a vicious 
parting bang on the capsule, 
and signaled to his tender. 

N ICK had news for him 
when he broke the sur- 
face. 

“T.I. radio’s been squawk- 
ing,” he said. “The Ruskis are 
asking everyone to look out 
for one of their rockets. They 
say it should be floating some- 
where off the Queensland 
coast. Sounds as if they want 
it badly.” 

“Did they say anything else 
about it?” Tibor asked anx- 
iously. 

“Oh, yes. It's been round 
the Moon a couple of times.” 
“That all?” 

“Nothing else that I remem- 
ber. There was a lot of sci- 
ence stuff I didn't get.” 

That figured; it was just 
like the Russians to keep as 



quiet as they could about an 
experiment that had gone 
wrong. 

“You tell T.I. that we'd 
found it?” 

“Are you crazy? Anyway, 
the radio's crook; couldn't if 
we wanted to. Fixed that rope 
properly?” 

“Yes — see if you haul 
her off the bottom.” 

The end of the rope had 
been wound round the main- 
mast, and in a few seconds it 
had been drawn taut. Al- 
though the sea was calm, 
there was a slight swell and 
the lugger was rolling ten or 
fifteen degrees. With each 
roll, the gunwales would 
rise a couple of feet, then 
drop again. There was a lift 
here of several tons, but one 
had to be careful in using it. 

The rope twanged, the 
woodwork groaned and 
creaked, and for a moment 
Tibor was afraid that the 
weakened line would part too 
soon. But it held, and the load 
lifted. 

They got a further hoist on 
the second roll — and on the 
third. Then the capsule was 
clear of the sea-bed, and the 
Arafura was listing slightly 
to port. 

“Let's go,” said Nick, tak- 
ing the wheel. “Should be able 
to get her half a mile before 
she bumps again.” 

The lugger began to move 
slowly towards the island, 
carrying its hidden burden 
beneath it.

As he leaned on the rails, 
letting the sun steam the 
moisture from his sodden 
clothing, Tibor felt at peace 
for the first time in — how 
many months? Even his hate 
had ceased to burn like fire 
in his brain. Perhaps, like 
love, it was a passion that 
could never be satisfied. But 
for the moment, at least, it 
was satiated. 

There was no weakening of 
his resolve. He was implaca- 
bly set upon the vengeance 
that had been so strangely — 
so miraculously — placed with- 
in his power. Blood called for 
blood, and now the ghosts 
that haunted him might rest 
at last. 

IV 

H E began to worry when 
they were two-thirds of 
the way to the island, and 
the rope had not parted. 

There were still four hours 
to go. That was much too 
long. For the first time it oc- 
curred to him that his entire 
plan might miscarry, and 
might even recoil on his head. 
Suppose that, despite every- 
thing, Nick managed to get 
the capsule up on the beach 
before the deadline? 

With a deep twang that set 
the whole ship vibrating, the 
rope came snaking out of the 
water, scattering spray in all 
directions. 

“Might have guessed,” mut- 
tered Nick. “She was just 

AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



starting to bump. You like to 
go down again, or shall I send 
one of the boys?” 

“I'll take it,” Tibor hastily 
answered. “I can do it quicker 
than they can.” 

That was perfectly true, but 
it took him twenty minutes 
to locate the capsule. The 
Arafura had drifted well away 
from it before Nick could stop 
the engine, and there was a 
time when Tibor wondered if 
he would ever find it again. 

He quartered the sea-bed in 
great arcs, and it was not un- 
til he had accidentally tan- 
gled in the training parachute 
that his search was ended. 
The shrouds lay pulsating 
slowly in the current like 
some weird and hideous ma- 
rine monster — but there was 
nothing that Tibor feared now 
except frustration, and his 
pulse barely quickened as he 
saw the whitely looming mass 
ahead. 

The capsule was scratched 
and stained with mud f but ap- 
peared undamaged. It was ly- 
ing on its side now, looking 
rather like a giant milk-churn 
that had been tipped over. 
The passenger must have 
been bumped around. But if 
he’d fallen all the way back 
from the Moon he must have 
been well padded and was 
probably still in good shape. 
Tibor hoped so. It would be 
a pity if the remaining three 
hours were wasted. 

Once again he rested the 
verdigrised copper of his hel- 

97 




met against the no-longer- 
q u i t e-so-brightly-gleaming 
metal of the capsule. 

“Hello!” he shouted. “Can 
you hear me?” 

Perhaps the Russian would 
try to balk him by remaining 
silent — but that surely, was 
asking too much of any man’s 
self-control. Tibor was right. 
Almost at once there was the 
sharp knock of the reply. 

“So glad you’re there,” he 
called back. “Things are work- 
ing out just the way I said, 
though I guess I’ll have to 
cut the rope a little deeper.” 

T HE capsule did not an- 
swer it. It never answered 
again, though Tibor banged 
and banged on the next dive — 
and on the next. 

But he hardly expected it 
to then, for they’d had to stop 
for a couple of hours to ride 
out a squall, and the time- 
limit had expired long before 
he made his final descent. 

He was a little annoyed 
about that, for he had planned 
a farewell message. He shout- 
ed it just the same, though he 
knew he was wasting his 
breath. 

By early afternoon, the 
Arafura had come in as close 
as she dared. There were only 
a few feet of water beneath 
her, and the tide was falling. 
The capsule broke surface at 
the bottom of each wave 
trough, and was now firmly 
stranded on a sandbank. 
There was no hope of moving 



it any further. It was stuck 
until a high sea dislodged it. 

Nick regarded the situation 
with an expert eye. 

“There’s a six-foot tide to- 
night,” he said. “The way 
she’s lying now, she’ll be in 
only a couple of feet of water 
at low. We’ll be able to get 
at her with the boats.” 

They waited off the sand- 
bank while the sun and the 
tide went down and the radio 
broadcast intermittent reports 
of a search that was coming 
closer but was still far away. 
Late in the afternoon the cap- 
sule was almost clear of the, 
water. The crew rowed the 
small boat towards it with a 
reluctance which Tibor found 
himself sharing, to his annoy- 
ance. 

“It’s got a dbor in the side,” 
said Nick suddenly. “Jeeze — 
think there’s anyone in it?” 

“Could be,” answered Ti- 
bor, his voice not as steady 
as he thought. 

Nick glanced at him curi- 
ously. His diver had been act- 
ing strangely all day, but he 
knew better than to ask him 
what was wrong. In this part 
of the world, you soon learned 
to mind your own business. 

The boat, rocking slightly 
in the choppy sea, had now 
come alongside the capsule. 
Nick reached out and grabbed 
one of the twisted antenna 
stubs. Then, with catlike 
agility, he clambered up the 
curved metal surface. Tibor 
made no attempt to follow 



98 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 




him, but watched silently 
from the boat as he examined 
the entrance hatch. 

'‘Unless it’s jammed,” Nick 
muttered, "there must be 
some way of opening it from 
outside. Just our luck if it 
needs special tools.” 

His fears were groundless. 
The word "Open” had been 
stencilled in ten languages 
round the recessed door- 
catch, and it took only sec- 
onds to deduce its mode of op- 
eration. As the air hissed out 
Nick said "Phew!” and turned 
suddenly pale. He looked at 
Tibor as if seeking support, 
but Tibor avoided his eye. 

Then, reluctantly, Nick 
lowered himself into the cap- 
sule. 

He was gone for a long 
time. At first, they could hear 
muffled bangings and bump- 
ings from the inside, followed 
by a string of bi-lingual pro- 
fanity. 

And then there was a si- 
lence that went on and on 
and on. 

When at last Nick’s head 
appeared above the hatchway, 
his leathery, wind-tanned face 
was gray and streaked with 
tears. As Tibor saw this in- 
credible sight, he felt a sud- 
d e n ghastly premonition. 
Something had gone horribly 
wrong, but his mind was too 
numb to anticipate the truth. 
It came soon enough, when 
Nick handed down his burden, 
no larger than an oversized 
doll. 

AT THE END OF THE ORBIT 



B LANCO took it, as Tibor 
shrank to the stern of the 
boat. 

As he looked at the calm, 
waxen face, fingers of ice 
seemed to close not only upon 
his heart, but round his loins. 
In the same moment, both 
hate and desire died forever 
within him, as he knew the 
price of his revenge. 

The dead astronaut was per- 
haps more beautiful in death 
than she had been in life. Tiny 
though she was, she must have 
been tough as well as highly- 
trained to qualify for this 
mission. As she lay at Tibor’s 
feet she was neither a Rus- 
sian, nor the first female hu- 
man being to have seen the far 
side of the Moon. She was 
merely the girl that he had 
killed. 

Nick was talking from a 
long way off. 

"She was carrying this,” he 
said, in an unsteady voice. 
"Had it tight in her hand. 
Took me a long time to get it 
out.” 

Tibor scarcely heard him, 
and never even glanced at the 
tiny spool of tape lying in 
Nick’s palm. He could not 
guess, in this moment beyond 
all feeling, that the Furies 
had yet to close in upon his 
soul — and that soon the whole 
world would be listening to 
an accusing voice from be- 
yond the grave, branding him 
more irrevocably than any 
man since Cain* END

THE 

MIGHTIEST 

MAN 

By PATRICK FAHY 



T HEY caught up with him 
in Belgrade. 

The aliens had gone by 
then, only a few shining metal 
huts in the Siberian tundra 
giving mute evidence that 
they had been anything other 
than a nightmare. 

It had seemed exactly like 
that. A nightmare in which 
all of Earth stood helpless, 
unable to resist or flee, while 
the obscene shapes slithered 
and flopped over all her green 
fields and fair cities. And the 
awakening had not brought 
the reassurance that it had all 
been a bad dream. That if it 
had happened in reality, the 
people of Earth would have 



100 



been capable of dealing with 
the terrible menace. It had 
been real. And they had been 
no more capable of resisting 
the giant intelligences than a 
child of killing the ogre in 
his favorite fairy story. 

It was an ironic parallel, 
because that was what finally 
saved Earth for its own peo- 
ple. A fairy story. 

The old fable of the lion 
and the mouse. When the lion 
had exhausted his atomic ar- 
mor and proud science against 
the invincible and immortal 
invaders of Earth — for they 
Could not be killed by any 
means — the mouse attacked 
and vanquished them. 

The mouse, the lowest form 
of life: the fungoids, the air 
of Earth swarming with mil- 
lions of their spores, attacked 
the monstrous bodies, grew 
and entwined within the gray 
convolutions that were their 
brain centers. And as the tiny 
thread-roots probed and tight- 
ened, the aliens screamed 
soundlessly. The intelligences 
toppled and fell, and at last 
that few among them who re- 
tained sanity gathered their 
lunatic brethren and fled as 
they had come. 

If he had known the effect 
the fungoids would have on 
them, he would have told them 
that too. He had told them 
everything else, when he had 
been snatched from a busy 
city street, a random speci- 
men of humanity to be 
probed and investigated. 

THE MIGHTIEST MAN 



They had chosen well. For 
the payment they offered him 
he was willing to barter the 
whole human race. As far as 
it lay in his power he did just 
that. 

He was not an educated 
man, though he was intelli- 
gent. It was child's play to 
them to strip his mind bare; 
but they had to know the in- 
tangibles too, the determined 
will of humanity to survive, 
the probabilities of the pattern 
of human behavior in a situa- 
tion which humanity had nev- 
er before faced. He told them 
all he could, gladly and will- 
ingly. He would have descend- 
ed to any treachery for the 
vast glittering reward they 
tempted him with. 

It wasn't easy for the Yu- 
goslavs to guard him and, 
anyway, their hearts weren't 
in the task. His treachery, the 
ultimate treason, the betrayal 
of the whole human race, was 
commonly known. 

Inevitably the mob got him 
and killed three policemen in 
the process. When they had 
sated their anger a little and 
the traitor had lost most of 
his clothes and the thumb of 
his right hand, they dragged 
him to the junction where the 
Danube meets the Sava and 
held him under the gray wa- 
ters with long poles, as if he 
was some poisonous reptile. 

He lay supinely on the bed 
of the river and smiled evilly 
while a hundred thousand peo- 
ple writhed in neural agony. 



101 




T wenty-four hours 

later the neural plague had 
spread to Zagreb and into 
Albania as far as Tirana. 
When it crossed to Leghorn in 
Italy the Balkans held twenty 
million lunatics and the Dan- 
ube was an artificial lake a 
hundred miles wide. 

They had used a "clean” 
bomb. So they were able to 
bring a loudspeaker van to* its 
edge and boom at him to come 
out. He allowed them to do 
that for some inscrutable rea- 
son; perhaps to demonstrate 
that his powers were selec- 
tive. Then it seemed he got 
tired of the farce, and cruel 
fingers twined themselves 
into the nerve centers of the 
President of Italy and the 
Prime Minister of the govern- 
ment of United Europe. He 
made them dance a horribly 
twisted pas de deux on the 
banks of the Danube for his 
perverted amusement. 

Then he released them, and 
released the millions of gib- 
bering, twitching idiots that 
inhabited Southern Europe, 
and he came out of the river 
bed in which he had lain for 
forty-eight hours. 

He walked alone through 
the deserted streets of Bel- 
grade until he came to the 
United Nations building. 
There he told a very brave 
lieutenant that he was willing 
to stand trial any place in the 
world they wished. 

For three days nobody came 
to arrest him. He sat alone 



with the lieutenant in the 
peopleless city of Belgrade 
and waited for his captors. 
They came then, timidly re- 
assured by his non-violence. 
While he talked to them 
pleasantly the citizens of 
London and Paris suddenly 
began to dance jerky and gro- 
tesque jigs on the pavements 
of their cities. In the same 
moment the Chief Justice of 
the Court of the Nations, at 
a cocktail party in Washing- 
ton, writhed in the exquisite 
pain of total muscle cramp, 
his august features twisted 
into a mask of abject fear. 

The trial itself was a legal 
farce. The prisoner promptly 
pleaded guilty to the charge 
of betraying mankind to an 
alien race, but he didn’t allow 
them to question him. When 
one lawyer persisted in face 
of his pleasant refusals, he 
died suddenly in a cramped 
ball of screaming agony. 

The gray-faced Chief Jus- 
tice inquired whether he 
wished to be sentenced and 
he answered yes, but not to 
death: They couldn’t kill him, 
he explained. That was part 
of the reward the aliens had 
given him. The other part was 
that he could kill or immo- 
bilize anybody in the world — 
or everybody — from any dis- 
tance. He sat back and smiled 
at the stricken courtroom. 
Then he lost his composure 
and his mouth twitched. He 
laughed uproariously and 
slapped his knees in ecstasy. 

PATRICK FAHY 



102 




It was plain that he was 
fond of a joke. 

An anonymous lawyer stood 
up and waited patiently for 
his merriment to subside. 

If this was true, he asked, 
why had not the aliens used 
this power? Why had they 
not simply killed off the in- 
habitants and taken over the 
vacant planet? The traitor 
gazed kindly at him; and a 
court stenographer who had 
cautiously picked up a pencil 
returned agonizingly to her 
foetal position and, that way, 
died. 

The traitor looked at his 
fingers and shrugged. The 
thumb that had been snapped 
off in the mob’s frenzy was 
more than half grown again. 

“They needed slaves,” he 
said simply. 

“And at the end, while some 
of them were still sane?” 

The traitor raised his eye- 
brows, giving him his full 
courteous attention. The law- 
yer sat down abruptly, his 
question unfinished. The 
creature who had betrayed his 
own race smiled at him and 
permitted him to live. 

He even completed his ques- 
tion for him, and answered it. 
“Why did they not kill then? 
They had something else on 
their minds — 4 ungoids !” He 
laughed uproariously at his 
macabre joke. “And in their 
minds too!” 

The lawyer’s blue eyes 
gazed at him steadily and he 
stopped laughing. In the 

THE MIGHTIEST MAN 



bated hush of the courtroom 
he said softly, “What a pity 
I'm not an alien too. You 
could have the fungoids de- 
stroy me!” 

He laughed again helpless- 
ly, the tears running down his 
cheeks. 

'THE Chief Justice ad- 
journed the Court then and 
the prisoner sauntered to his 
comfortable quarters in front 
of his frightened guards. 

That night, in his own liv- 
ing room, the Chief Justice 
danced an agonized fandango 
in front of his horror-stricken 
wife and the anonymous law- 
yer sat in his apartment, star- 
ing at the blahk wall. He was 
glad the aliens had not made 
the traitor telepathic too. 

He had found the chink in 
his armor. 

The neural paralysis, the 
murders by remote control, 
were acts of a conscious will. 
He had himself admitted that 
if his mind was destroyed his 
powers would be destroyed 
with it. The aliens had not 
sought revenge because their 
minds were totally occupied 
with saving themselves. The 
stricken ones had simply lost 
the power. 

The knowledge was useless 
to him. There was no way 
they could attack his mind 
without his knowing it. 

Possibly they could steal 
away his consciousness by 
drugging or bludgeoning, but 
it would be racial suicide to 



103 




attempt it. In the split mo- 
ment of realization he would 
kill every human being on 
Earth. There would be nobody 
left to operate on his brain, 
to make him a mindless, pow- 
erless idiot for the rest of 
time. For any period of time, 
he corrected himself. His 
brain would heal again. 

It was useless to think 
about it. There was nothing 
they could use against his in- 
vincibility. The only hope was 
to attack him unawares . and 
if that hope was a fraction 
less than a certainty it could 
only mean final and absolute 
catastrophe. 

The lawyer looked at his 
watch. It was four in the 
morning. 

He went into the kitchen- 
ette and then shrugged him- 
self into his coat? He walked 
through the silent streets, 
past the city hospital where 
the Chief Justice lay in agony 
while the motor impulses 
from his nerve centers 
wrenched and twisted his 
body. He entered the foyer of 
the luxury hotel where the 
race betrayer was held pris- 
oner and took the elevator to 
the sixth floor. 

Two sleepy guards jerked 
erect outside the unlocked 
door. He put his finger to his 
lips, enjoining them to si- 
lence. Then he entered the 
room and stood for a moment 
over the man who was invin- 
cible and immortal — and hu- 
man. Human, and subject to 



the involuntary unconscious- 
ness which nature demands 
from all men. He slept. 

The eyelids fluttered. The 
lawyer took the steel meat 
skewer from his pocket. He 
thrust it through a half- 
opened eye and rotated if, 
methodically reducing the 
soft brain to formless mush. 

After that the trial proceed- 
ed normally. 

The prisoner stared vacant- 
ly in front of him and all his 
movements had to be direct- 
ed. But he was alive and his 
thumb was full grown again. 

It was the lawyer that no- 
ticed this and pointed out the 
implications. The thumb had 
grown to full size in less than 
six weeks. They must regard 
that as their maximum period 
of immunity. 

They ruminated over it for 
another four days. The ques- 
tion was a tricky one, for ma- 
lignant immortality was be- 
yond human solution. It was 
not just a matter of dealing 
out punishment. The problem 
now was the protection of the 
race from sudden annihila- 
tion. An insolvable problem, 
but one that must be solved. 
They could only do their 
best. 

He was sentenced to life 
imprisonment, with a special 
feature. 

It was decided he should be 
guillotined once a month as 
long as he lived.

PENNY WISE AND 
FASHION FOOLISH 

By THEODORE STURGEON 



OU’RE getting robbed. 
Let’s not go looking for 
the robber just now; he isn’t 
easy to catch, partly because 
he*s got too many accomplices, 
and partly because he’s too 
doggone big. But he can be 
locked out. 

What you’re getting robbed 
of is books — or to put it more 
personally, you’re missing 
what these books have stored 
up for you, and it’s a real in- 
justice. 

One reason is that you are, 
as you’ve been taught to be, 
penny-wise. I can’t complete- 
ly knock that. Waiting for a 
cheap edition sometimes 
makes sense, providing you 
don’t forget, while waiting, 
what it was you were waiting 
for. But there are times when 
there isn’t a paperback re- 
print and there won’t be. You 
may well be thrifting your- 
self out of some real riches. 

Another reason is that you 
(this time, it’s a collective, 
averaged *you”) are fashion- 
foolish, and for this you 
ought to go heave your silly 
head candied. There has been 
for many years a never-ex- 



amined, take n-for-granted 
conviction that books are per- 
ishables, and must be bought 
and consumed while crisp, 
like iceberg lettuce. This con- 
viction is of course fostered 
by bookclubs, who go right 
along with the idea that it 
Just Isn’t Done to be seen 
reading a book Everybody 
Was Reading last year, or 
even last spring. 

It may seem simple-minded 
to say this in so many words, 
but it must be said: Honest 
to goodness, friend; any book 
is a new book if it’s new to 
you. And further: Any price 
is a cheap price if it substan- 
tially increases your under- 
standing. 

There’s a whole wide cate- 
gory of wonderful books 
which you never see because 
some reviewers back off from 
their high price-tags, or be- 
cause some reviewers never 
get to see them (they’re pub- 
lished by small firms who can 
circulate only just so many 
review copies) or because, 
even when you hear about 
them, you’re unwilling to part 
with the dough or because,

me t criminal of all, you won't 
look at something with a last- 
year's copyright on it. 

H ERE are two cases in 
point: The Human Ani- 
mal, by Weston La Bar re, 
Chicago University Press, 
1954. 372 pp. with index. $6.00. 
And: A Handbook of Space 
Flight, by Wayne A Proell 
and Norman J. Bowman, Per- 
astadion Press (10630 S. Saint 
Louis Ave., Chicago) 1958. 
458 pp with index. $7.00. 

The La Barre is a hand- 
some volume and an absolute 
delight to read. There are 
times when the author is a 
very funny man indeed. None 
of which keeps it from being 
a thorough, scholarly, some- 
times profound examination 
of the human animal, as seen 
from the points of view of the 
biologist, the physical anthro- 
pologist, the cultural ditto, 
and the psychologist, all of 
which Mr. La Barre seems to 
be. When he is through with 
you, you will understand as 
you never did before why we 
walk and talk and marry and 
govern ourselves the way we 
d ° — really why, starting from 
the engineering of the body 
itself, and all that went into 
that, clear back to the amoeba. 

Mr. La Barre, in the inter- 
ests of accuracy, will be using 
his share of anthropological 
(and other) technicalities ; but 
never once does he throw you 
a term without making sure 
you understand it. 



The Handbook is surely one 
of the most extraordinary 
collections of scientific, tech- 
nological and speculative data 
ever put between covers. Ex- 
cellently cross-indexed, clear- 
ly and sensibly written, it 
hands you an example of how 
to calculate the exhaust veloc- 
ity and thrust of a rocket by 
the Hirshfelder static equili- 
brium method; wjiat to do if 
someone spills rocket-fuel on 
your ring-finger; formulae 
for solid propellants; pages 
and pages of conversion fac- 
tors (to convert horsepower 
into kilogram calories per 
minute, multiply by 10. 694). 
There are diagrams of practi- 
cal space-ships, including a 
real beauty by Arthur C. 
Clarke, and a long list of 
speculative space drives 
culled from s-f magazines. 
There's a truly marvellous 3- 
dimensional projection of sur- 
rounding space, with all its 
stars up to 15 light-years 
away precisely located ; 
there's a list of major UFO 
sightings up to publication 
date; there are lucid descrip- 
tions of 7 different types of 
nuclear reaction, a list of pos- 
sible careers in the space 
game and where to apply for 
jobs... it is impossible to de- 
scribe, or even to list, the 
scope of this remarkable book 
and the number of its sub- 
jects.

By KEITH LAUMER 



I 

R ETIEF paused before a 
tall mirror to check the 
overlap of the four sets of 
lapels that ornamented the 
vermilion cutaway of a First 
Secretary and Consul. 

“Come along, Retief,” Mag- 
nan said. “The Ambassador 
has a word to say to the staff 
before we go in.” 

“I hope he isn’t going to 
change the spontaneous 
speech he plans to make when 
the Potentate impulsively 
suggests a trade agreement 
along the lines they’ve been 
discussing for the last two 
months.” 

“Your derisive attitude is 
uncalled for, Retief,” Mag- 
nan said sharply. “I think you 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



realize it’s delayed your pro- 
motion in the Corps.” 

Retief took a last glance in 
the mirror. “I’m not sure I 
want a promotion,” he said. 
“It would mean more lapels.” 
Ambassador Crodf oiler 
pursed his lips, waiting until 
Retief and M a g n a n took 
places in the ring of Terres- 
trial diplomats around him. 

“A word of caution only, 
gentlemen,” he said. “Keep 
always foremost in your 
minds the necessity for our 
identification with the Nenni 
Caste. Even a hint of famili- 
arity with lower echelons 
could mean the failure of the 
mission. Let us remember 
that the Nenni represent au- 
thority here on Petreac. Their 
traditions must be observed. 



107 




whatever our personal prefer- 
ances. Let’s go along now. 
The Potentate will be making 
his entrance any moment.” 
Magnan came to Retief’s 
side as they moved toward the 
salon. 

“The Ambassador’s remarks 
were addressed chiefly to 
you, Retief,” he said. “Your 
laxness in these matters is 
notorious. Naturally, I believe 
firmly in democratic princi- 
ples myself — ” 

“Have you ever had a feel- 
ing, Mr. Magnan, that there’s 
a lot going on here that we 
don’t know about?” 

Magnan nodded. “Quite 
so. Ambassador Crodfoller’s 
point exactly. Matters which 
are not of concern to the 
Nenni are of no concern to 
us.” 

“Another feeling I get is 
that the Nenni aren’t very 
bright. Now suppose — ” 

“I’m not given to supposi- 
tions, Retief. We’re here to 
implement the policies of the 
Chief of Mission. And I 
should dislike to be in the 
shoes of a member of the staff 
whose conduct jeopardized 
the agreement that will be 
concluded here tonight.” 

A bearer with a tray of 
drinks rounded a fluted 
column, shied as he confront- 
ed the diplomats, fumbled the 
tray, grabbed and sent a glass 
crashing to the floor. 

Magnan leaped back, slap- 
ping at the purple cloth of hts 

106 



pants leg. Retief’s hand shot 
out to steady the tray. The 
servant rolled terrified eyes. 

“I’ll take one of these, now 
that you’re here,” Retief said. 
He took a glass from the tray, 
winking at the servant. 

“No harm done,” he said. 
“Mr. Magnan’s just warming 
up for the big dance.” 

A Nenni major-domo bus- 
tled up, rubbing his hands 
politely. 

“Some trouble here?” he 
said. “What happened, Hon- 
orables, what, what ...” 

“The blundering idiot,” 
Magnan spluttered. “How 
dare—” 

“You’re quite an actor, Mr. 
Magnan,” Retief said. “If I 
didn’t know about your demo- 
cratic principles, I’d think 
you were really mad.” 

The servant ducked his 
head and scuttled away. 

“Has this fellow...” The 
major-domo eyed the retreat- 
ing bearer. 

“I dropped my glass,” Re- 
tief said. “Mr. Magnan’s up- 
set because he hates to see 
liquor wasted.” 

Retief turned to find him- 
self face-to-face with Ambas- 
sador Crodfoller. 

“I witnessed that,” The 
Ambassador hissed. “By the 
goodness of Providence, the 
Potentate and his retinue 
haven’t appeared yet. But I 
can assure you the servants 
saw it. A more un-Nenni-like 
display I would find it diffi- 
cult to imagine!” 



KEITH LAUMER 




Retief arranged his fea- 
tures in an expression of deep 
interest. 

“More un-Nenni-like, sir?” 
he said. “I’m not sure I — ” 
"Bah !” The Ambassador 
glared at Retief. "Your rep- 
utation has preceeded you, 
sir. Your name is associated 
with a number of the most 
bizarre incidents in Corps 
history. I’m warning you; I’ll 
tolerate nothing.” He turned 
and stalked away. 

"Ambassador-baiting is a 
dangerous sport, Retie f 
Magnan said. 

Retief took a swallow of his 
drink. "Still,” he said, "it’s 
better than no sport at all.” 
"Your time would be better 
spent observing the Nenni 
mannerisms. Frankly, Retief, 
you’re not fitting into the 
group at all well.” 

"I’ll be candid with you, 
Mr. Magnan. The group gives 
me the willies.” 

"Oh, the Nenni are a trifle 
frivolous. I’ll concede,” Mag- 
nan said. "But it’s with them 
that we must deal. And you’d 
be making a contribution to 
the overall mission if you 
merely abandoned that rather 
arrogant manner of yours.” 
Magnan looked at Retief crit- 
ically. "You can’t help your 
height, of course. But 
couldn’t you curve your back 
just a bit — and possibly as- 
sume a more placating ex- 
pression? Just act a little 
more ...” 

"Girlish?” 



"Exactly.” Magnan nodded, 
then looked sharply at Retief. 

Retief drained his glass 
and put it on a passing tray. 

"I’m better at acting girlish 
when I’m well juiced,” he 
said. "But I can’t face anoth- 
er sorghum-and-soda. I sup- 
pose it would be un-Nenni- 
like to slip the bearer a credit 
and ask for a Scotch and wa- 
ter.” 

"D e c i d e d 1 y.” Magnan 
glanced toward a sound across 
the room. 

"Ah, here’s the Potentate 
now!” He hurried off. 

Retief watched the bearers 
coming and going, bringing 
trays laden with drinks, car- 
rying off empties. There was 
a lull in the drinking now, as 
the diplomats gathered 
around the periwigged Chief 
of State and his courtiers. 
Bearers loitered near the 
service door, eyeing the nota- 
bles. Retief strolled over to 
the service door, pushed 
through it into a narrow 
white-tiled hall filled with 
the odors of the kitchen. Si- 
lent servants gaped as he 
passed, watching as he moved 
along to the kitchen door and 
stepped inside. 

II 

A dozen or more low-caste 
Petreacans, gathered 
around a long table in the 
center of the room looked up, 
startled. A heap of long-blad- 
ed bread knives, French 



GAMBLER S WORLD 



10S 




knives, carving knives and 
cleavers lay in the center of 
the table. Other knives were 
thrust into belts or held in 
the hands of the men. A fat 
man in the yellow sarong of 
a cook stood frozen in the act 
of handing a knife to a tall 
one-eyed sweeper. 

Retief took one glance, 
then let his eyes wander to a 
far corner of the room. Hum- 
ming a careless little tune, he 
sauntered across to the open 
liquor shelves, selected a gar- 
ish green bottle and turned 
unhurriedly back toward the 
door. The group of servants 
watched him, transfixed. 

As Retief reached the door, 
it swung inward. Magnan, 
lips pursed, stood in the 
doorway. 

“I had a premonition,” he 
said. 

‘Til bet it was a dandy,” 
Retief said. “You must tell 
me all about it — in the salon.” 

“We’ll have this out right 
here,” Magnan snapped. “I’ve 
warned you!” Magnan’s voice 
trailed off as he took in the 
scene around the table. 

“After you,” Retief said, 
nudging Magnan toward the 
door. 

“What’s going on here?” 
Magnan barked. He stared at 
the men, started around Re- 
tief. A hand stopped him. 

“Let’s be going,” Retief 
said, propelling Magnan to- 
ward the hall. 

“Those knives!” Magnan 
yelped. “Take your hands off 



me, Retief! What are you 
men — ?” 

Retief glanced back. The 
fat cook gestured suddenly, 
and the men faded back. The 
cook stood, arm cocked, a 
knife across his palm. 

“Close the door and make 
no sound,” he said softly. 

Magnan pressed back 
against Retief. “Let’s... 
r-run...” he faltered. 

Retief turned slowly, put 
his hands up. 

“I don’t run very well with 
a knife in my back,” he said. 
“Stand very still, Magnan, 
and do just what he tells you.” 

“Take them out through the 
back,” the cook said. 

“What does he mean?” 
Magnan spluttered. “Here, 
you — ” 

“Silence,” the cook said, al- 
most casually. Magnan gaped 
at him, closed his mouth. 

Two of the men with 
knives came to Retief’s side 
and gestured, grinning broad- 
ly* 

“Let’s go, peacocks,” one 
said. 

Retief and Magnan silently 
crossed the kitchen, went out 
the back door, stopped on 
command and stood waiting. 
The sky was brilliant with 
stars. A gentle breeze stirred 
the tree-tops beyond the gar- 
den. Behind them the serv- 
ants talked in low voices. 

“You go too, Illy/* the cook 
was saying. 

“Do it here/* another said.

“And carry their damn dead 
bodies down?” 

“Pitch 'em behind the 
hedge.” 

“I said the river. Three of 
you is plenty for a couple of 
Nenni. We don't know if we 
want to — ” 

“They're foreigners, not 
Nenni. We don't know—” 

“So they're foreign Nenni. 
Makes no difference. I've 
seen them. I need every man 
here; now get going.” 

“What about the big guy? 
He looks tough.” 

“Him? He waltzed into the 
room and didn't notice a 

thing. But watch the other

one. 

At a prod from a knife 
point, Retief moved off down 
the walk, two of the escort 
behind him and Magnan, an- 
other going ahead to scout 
the way. 

Magnan moved closer to 
Retief. 

“Say,” he said in a whisper. 
“That fellow in the lead ; isn't 
he the one who spilled the 
drink? The one you took the 
blame for?” 

“That's him, all right. He 
doesn't seem nervous any 
more, I notice.” 

“You saved him from seri- 
ous punishment,” Magnan 
said. “He'll be grateful; he'll 
let us go. .” 

“Better check with the fel- 
lows with the knives before 
you act on that.” 

“Say something to him,” 
Magnan hissed. “Remind 
him.”

'THE lead man fell back in 
A line with Retief and Mag- 
nan. 

“These two are scared of 
you,” he said, grinning and 
jerking a thumb toward the 
knife-handlers. “They haven't 
worked around the Nenni like 
me; they don't know you.” 
“Don't you recognize this 
gentleman?” Magnan said. 

“He did me a favor,” the 
man said. “I remember.” 
“What's it all about?” Re- 
tief asked. 

“The revolution. We're 
taking over now.” 

“Who's W?” 

“The People's Anti-Fascist 
Freedom League.” 

“What are all the knives 
for?” 

“For the Nenni ; and for all 
you foreigners.” 

“What do you mean?” 
Magnan gasped. 

“We'll slit all the throats 
at one time. Saves a lot of 
running around.” 

“What time will that be?” 
“Just at down; and dawn 
comes early, this time of year. 
By full daylight the PAFFL 
will be in charge.” 

“You’ll never succeed,” 
Magnan said. “A few servants 
with knives! You'll all be 
caught and killed.” 

“By who, the Nenni?” the 
man laughed. “You Nenni are 
a caution.” 

“But we're not Nenni — ” 
“We've watched you; 
you're the same. You’re part 
of the same blood-sucking 
class.”

“There are better ways to, 
uh, adjust differences/’ Mag- 
nan said. “This killing won’t 
help you. I’ll personally see 
to it that your grievances are 
heard in the Corps Courts. I 
can assure you that the plight 
of the downtrodden workers 
will be alleviated. Equal 
rights for all — ” 

“These threats won’t 
work,” the man said. “You 
don’t scare me.” 

“Threats? I’m promising 
relief to the exploited classes 
of Petreac!” 

“You must be nuts,” the 
man said. “You trying to up- 
set the system or something?” 
“Isn’t that the purpose of 
your revolution?” 

“Look, Nenni, we’re tired 
of you 9 Nenni getting all the 
graft. We want our turn. 
What good would it do us to 
run Petreac if there’s no 
loot?” 

“You mean you intend to 
oppress the people?. But 
they’re your own group.” 
“Group, schmoop. We’re 
taking all the chances; we’re 
doing the work. We deserve 
the payoff. You think we’re 
throwing up good jobs for the 
fun of it*?” 

“You’re basing a revolt on 
these cynical premises?” 
“Wise up, Nenni. There’s 
never been a revolution for 
any other reason.” 

“Who’s in charge of this?” 
Retief said. 

“Shokc, the head chef.” 

“I mean the big boss. Who 



tells Shoke what all to do?” 

“Oh, that’s Zorn. Look out, 
here’s where we start down 
the slope. It’s slippery.” 

“Look,” M a g n a n said. 
“You.” 

“My name’s Illy.” 

“Mr. Illy, this man showed 
you mercy when he could 
have had you beaten.” 

“Keep moving. Yeah, I said 
I was grateful.” 

“Yes,” Magnan said, swal- 
lowing hard. “A noble emo- 
tion, gratitude. You won’t re- 
gret it.” 

“I always try to pay back 
a good turn,” Illy said. 
“Watch your step now on this 
sea-wall.” 

“You’ll never regret it,” 
Magnan said. 

“This is far enough.” Illy 
motioned to one of the knife 
men. “Give me your knife, 
Vug.” 

The man passed his knife 
to Illy. There was an odor of 
sea-mud and kelp. Small 
waves slapped against the 
stones of the sea-wall. The 
wind was stronger here. 

“I know a neat stroke,” 
Illy said. “Practically pain- 
less. Who’s first?” 

“What do you mean ?” Mag- 
nan quavered. 

“I said I was grateful. I’ll 
do it myself, give you a nice 
clean job. You know these 
amateurs ; botch it up and 
have a guy floppin’ around, 
yellin’ and spatterin’ every- 
body up.” 

“I’m first,” Retief said. He

pushed past Magnan, stopped 
suddenly, drove a straight 
punch at lily’s mouth* 

T HE long blade flicked 
harmlessly over . Retief’s 
shoulder as Illy fell. Retief 
whirled, leaped past Magnan, 
took the unarmed servant by 
the throat and belt, lifted him 
and slammed him against the 
third man. Both scrambled, 
yelped and fell from the sea- 
wall into the water. 

Retief turned back to Illy. 
He pulled off the man’s belt 
and strapped his hands to- 
gether. 

Magnan found his voice. 
“You. .we. .they. .” 

“I know,” Retief said. 
“We’ve got to get back,” 
Magnan said. “Warn them!” 
“We’d never get through 
the rebel cordon around the 
palace. And if we did, trying 
to give an alarm would only 
set the assassinations off 
early.” 

“We can’t just...” 

“We’ve got to go to the 
source; this fellow Zorn. Get 
him to call it off.” 

“We’d be killed! At least 
we’re safe here.” 

Illy groaned and opened his 
eyes. He sat up. 

“On your feet. Illy,” Re- 
tief said. 

Illy looked around. “I’m 
sick,” he said. 

“The damp air is bad for 
you. Let’s be going.” Retief 
pulled the man to his feet. 
“Where does Zorn stay when 

GAMBLER’S WORLD 



he’s in town?” he damanded. 

“What happened? Where’s 
Vug and. .” 

“They had an accident. 
Fell in the pond.” 

Illy gazed down at the rest- 
less black water. 

“I guess I had you Nenni 
figured wrong.” 

“Us Nenni have hidden 
qualities. Let’s get moving 
before Vug and Slug make it 
to shore and start it all over 
again.” 

“No hurry,” Illy said. 
“They can’t swim.” He spat 
into the water. “So long, Vug. 
So long, Toscin. Take a pull, 
at the Hell Horn for me.” He 
started off along the sea wall 
toward the sound of the surf. 

“You want to see Zorn, I’ll 
take you to see Zorn,” he 
said. “I can’t swim either.”

A “that the casino is a front 
for his political activities.” 
“He makes plenty off it. 
This PAFFL is a new kick. 
I never heard about it until 
maybe a couple months ago.” 
Retief motioned toward a 
dark shed with an open door. 

“We’ll stop here,” he said, 
“long enough to strip the 
gadgets off these uniforms.” 
Illy, hands strapped behind 
his back, stood by and 
watched as Retief and Mag- 
nan removed medals, ribbons, 
orders and insignia from the 
formal diplomatic garments.

“This may help some,” Re- 
tief said, “if the word is out 
that two diplomats are 
loose.” 

“It’s a breeze,” Illy said. 
“We see cats in purple and 
orange tailcoats all the time.” 

“I hope you’re right,” Re- 
tief said. “But if we’re called, 
you’ll be the first to go, Illy.” 

“You’re a funny kind of 
Nenni,” Illy said, eyeing Re- 
tief. “Toscin and Vug must 
be wonderin’ what happened 
to ’em.” 

“If you think I’m good at 
drowning people, you ought 
to see me with a knife. Let’s 
get going.” 

“It’s only a little way now,” 
Illy said. “But you better un- 
tie me. Somebody’s liable to 
stick their nose in and get me 
killed.” 

“I’ll take the chance. How 
do we get to the casino?” 

“We follow this street. It 
twists around and goes under 
a couple tunnels. When we 
get to the Drunkard’s Stairs 
we go up and it’s right in 
front of us. A pink front with 
a sign like a big Luck 
Wheel.” 

“Give me your belt, Mag- 
nan,” Retief said. 

Magnan handed it over. 

“Lie down. Illy,” Retief 
said. 

The servant looked at Re- 
tief. 

“Vug and Toscin will be 
glad to see me,” he said. “But 
they’ll never believe me.” He 
lay down. Retief strapped his 



feet together and stuffed a 
handkerchief in his mouth. 

“Why are you doing that?” 
Magnan asked. “We need 
him.” 

“We know the way. And we 
don’t need anyone to an- 
nounce our arrival. It’s only 
on three-dee that you can 
march a man through a gang 
of his pals with a finger in 
his back.” 

Magnan looked at the man. 
“Maybe you’d better, uh, cut 
his throat,” he said. 

Illy rolled his eyes. 

“That’s a very un-Nenni- 
like suggestion, Mr. Magnan,” 
Retief said. “If we have any 
trouble finding the casino, I’ll 
give it serious thought.” 

There were few people in 
the narrow street. Shops were 
shuttered, windows dark. 

“Maybe they heard about 
the coup,” Magnan said. 
“They’re lying low.” 

“More likely, they’re at the 
palace picking up their 
knives.” 

They rounded a corner, 
stepped over a man curled in 
the gutter snoring heavily 
and found themselves at the 
foot of a long flight of lit- 
tered stone steps. 

“The Drunkard’s Stair’s are 
plainly m a r k e d,” Magnan 
sniffed. 

“I hear sounds up there,” 
Retief said. “Sounds of mer- 
rymaking.” 

“Maybe we’d better go 
back.” 

“Merrymaking doesn’t scare

me/' Retief said. "Come to 
think of it, I don't know what 
the word means.” He started 
up, Magnan behind him. 

A T the top of the long stair 
a dense throng milled in 
the alley-like street. 

A giant illuminated roulette 
wheel revolved slowly above 
them. A loudspeaker blared 
the chant of the croupiers 
from the tables inside. Mag- 
nan and Retief moved through 
the crowd toward the wide- 
open doors. 

Magnan plucked at Retief's 
sleeve. “Are you sure we

this? Maybe we ought to wait 
a bit, look around. .” 

“When you're where you 
have no business being,” Re- 
tief said, “always stride along 
purposefully. If you loiter, 
people begin to get curious.” 
Inside, a mob packed the 
wide, low-ceilinged room, 
clustered around gambling de- 
vices in the form of towers, 
tables and basins. 

"What do we do now?” 
Magnan asked. 

"We gamble. How much 
money do you have in your 
pockets?” 

"Why ...a few credit s.” 
Magnan handed the money to 
Retief. "But what about the 
man Zorn?” 

"A purple cutaway is con- 
spicuous enough, without ig- 
noring the tables,” Retief 
said. "We've got a hundred 
credits between us. We’ll get 
to Zorn in due course, I

hope.” 

"Your pleasure, gents” a 
bullet-headed man said, eye- 
ing the colorful evening 
clothes of the diplomats. 
"You'll be wantin' to try your 
luck at the Zoop tower, I'd 
guess. A game for real sport- 
ing gents.” 

"Why ... ah ... ” Magnan 
said. 

"What's a zoop tower?” Re- 
tief asked. 

"Out-of-towners, hey?” The 
bullet-headed man shifted his 
dope-stick to the other corner 
of his mouth. "Zoop is a great 
little game. Two teams of 
players buy into the pot. Each 
player takes a lever; the ob- 
ject is to make the ball drop 
from the top of the tower into 
your net. Okay?” 

"What's the ante?” 

"I got a hundred-credit pot 
workin’ now, gents.” 

Retief nodded. "We'll try 
it.” 

The shill led the way to an 
eight-foot tower mounted on 
gymbals. Two perspiring men 
in trade-class pullovers 
gripped two of the levers that 
controlled the tilt of the tow- 
er. A white ball lay in a hol- 
low in the thick glass plat- 
form at the top. From the cen- 
ter, an intricate pattern of 
grooves led out to the edge of 
the glass. Retief and Magnan 
took chairs before the two 
free levers. 

"When the light goes on, 
gents, work the lever to jack 
the tower. You got three 

115 




gears. Takes a good arm to 
work top gear. That's this 
button here. The little knob 
controls what way you’re 
goin\ May the best team win. 
I’ll take the hundred credits 
now.” 

R ETIEF handed over the 
money. A red light flashed 
on, and Retief tried \hz lever. 

It moved easily, with a 
ratcheting sound. The tower 
trembled, slowly tilted to- 
ward the two perspiring 
workmen pumping frantically 
at their' levers. Magnan start- 
ed slo,wly, accelerated as he 
saw the direction the tower 
was taking. 

‘‘Faster, Retief,” he said. 
“They’re winning.” 

“This is against the clock, 
gents,” the bullet-headed man 
said. “If nobody wins when 
the light goes off, the house 
takes all.” 

“Crank it over to the left,” 
Retief said. 

“I’m getting tired.” 

“Shift to a lower gear.” 

The tower leaned. The ball 
stirred, rolled into a concen- 
tric channel. Retief shifted to 
middle gear, worked the lev- 
er. The tower creaked to a 
stop, started back upright. 

“There isn’t any lower 
gear,” Magnan gasped. One 
of the two on the other side 
of the tower shifted to mid- 
dle gear; the other followed 
suit. They worked harder 
now, heaving against the stiff 
levers. The tower quivered, 



moved slowly toward their 
side. 

“I’m exhausted,” Magnan 
gasped. He dropped the lever, 
lolled back in the chair, gulp- 
ing air. Retief shifted posi- 
tion, took Magnan’s lever 
with his left hand. 

“Shift it to middle gear,” 
Retief said. Magnan gulped, 
punched the button and 
slumped back, panting. 

“My arm,” he said. “I’ve in- 
jured myself.” 

The two men in pullovers 
conferred hurriedly as they 
cranked their levers; then one 
punched a button and the oth- 
er reached across, using his 
left arm to help. 

“They’ve shifted to high,” 
Magnan said. “Give up, it’s 
hopeless.” 

“Shift me to high,” Retief 
said. “Both buttons!” 

Magnan complied. Retief’s 
shoulders bulged. He brought 
one lever down, then the 
other, alternately, slowly at 
first, then faster. The tower 
jerked, tilted toward him, 
farther . The ball rolled in 
the channel, found an outlet — 

Abruptly, both Retief’s lev- 
ers froze. 

The tower trembled, wav- 
ered and moved back. Retief 
heaved. One lever folded at 
the base, bent down and 
snapped off short. Retief 
braced his feet, took the oth- 
er lever with both hands and 
pulled. 

There was a rasp of metal 
friction, and a loud twang.

KEITH LAUMER 




The lever came free, a length 
of broken cable flopping into 
view. The tower fell over as 
the two on the other side 
scrambled aside. 

“Hey !” Bullet-head yelled. 
“You wrecked my equip- 
ment r 

Retief got up and faced 
him. 

“Does Zorn know you’ve 
got your tower rigged for 
suckers ?” 

“You tryin’ to call me a 
cheat or something?” 

The crowd had fallen back, 
ringing the two men. Bullet- 
head glanced around. With a 
lightning motion, he plucked 
a knife from somewhere. 

“That’ll be five hundred 
credits for the equipment,” 
he said. “Nobody calls Kippy 
a cheat.” 

R ETIEF picked up the 
broken lever. 

“Don’t make me hit you 
with this, you cheap chisel- 
er.” 

Kippy looked at the bar. 
“Cornin’ in here,” he said 
indignantly, looking to the 
crowd for support. “Bustin’ 
up my rig, callin’ names ...” 
“I want a hundred credits,” 
Retief said. “Now.” 
“Highway robbery!” Kippy 
yelled. 

“Better pay up,” somebody 
called. 

“Hit him, mister,” someone 
else said. 

A broad-shouldered man 
with graying hair pushed 

GAMBLER’S WORLD 



through the crowd and looked 
around. “You heard ’em, Kip- 
py. Give,” he said. 

The shill growled but 
tucked his knife away. Re- 
luctantly he peeled a bill 
from a fat roll and handed it 
over. 

The newcomer looked from 
Retief to Magnan. 

“Pick another game, strang- 
ers,” he said. “Kippy made 
a little mistake.” 

“This is small-time stuff,” 
Retief said. “I’m interested 
in something big.” 

The broad shouldered man 
lit a perfumed dope stick. 
“What would you call big?” 
he said softly. 

“What’s the biggest you’ve 
got?” 

The man narrowed his eyes, 
smiling. “Maybe you’d like to 
try Slam.” 

“Tell me about it.” 

“Over here.” The crowd 
opened up, made a path. Re- 
tief and Magnan followed 
across the room to a brightly- 
lit glass-walled box. 

There was an arm-sized 
opening at waist height. In- 
side was a hand grip. A two- 
foot plastic globe a quarter 
full of chips hung in the cen- 
ter 1 . Apparatus was mounted 
at the top of the box. 

“Slam pays good odds,” the 
man said. “You can go as 
high as you like. Chips cost 
you a hundred credits. You 
start it up by dropping a 
chip in here.” He indicated a 
slot. 



117 




44 You take the hand grip. 
When you squeeze, it un- 
locks. The globe starts to 
turn. You can see, it's full of 
chips. There's a hole at the 
top. As long as you hold the 
grip, the bowl turns. The 
harder you squeeze, the fast- 
er it turns. Eventually it'll 
turn over to where the hole 
is down, and chips fall out. 

“On the other hand, there's 
contact plates spotted around 
the bowl. When one of 'em 
lines up with a live contact, 
you get quite a little jolt — 
guaranteed nonlethal. All 
you've got to do is hold on 
long enough, and you'll get 
the payoff." 

“How often does this ran- 
dom pattern put the hole 
down?" 

44 Anywhere from three min- 
utes to fifteen, with the aver- 
age run of players. Oh, by the 
way, one more thing. That 
lead block up there — " The 
man motioned with his head 
toward a one-foot cube sus- 
pended by a thick cable. 
44 It's rigged to drop every 
now and again. Averages five 
minutes. A warning light 
flashes first. You can take a 
chance; sometimes the light's 
a bluff. You can set the 
clock back on it by dropping 
another chip — or you can let 
go the grip.” 

Retief looked at the massive 
block of metal. 

44 That would mess up a 
man's dealing hand, wouldn't 
it?" 



44 The last two jokers who 
were too cheap to feed the 
machine had to have 'em off. 
Their arms, I mean. That 
lead's heavy stuff." 

44 I don't suppose your ma- 
chine has a habit of getting 
stuck, like Kippy's?" 

The broad-shouldered man 
frowned. 

44 You're a strange^," he 
said. 44 You don’t know any 
better." 

44 It's a fair game, Mister," 
someone called. 

44 Where do I buy the 
chips?" 

The man smiled. “I'll fix 
you up. How many?" 

“One." 

“A big spender, eh?" The 
man snickered, but handed 
over a large plastic chip. 

IV 

R ETIEF stepped to the 
machine, dropped the 
coin. 

44 If you want to change 
your mind," the man said, 
“you can back out now. All 
it'll cost you is the chip you 
dropped.” 

Retief reached through the 
hole, took the grip. It was 
leather padded hand-filling. 
He squeezed it. There was a 
click and bright lights sprang 
up. The crowd ah!-ed. The 
globe began to twirl lazily. 
The four-inch hole at its top 
was plainly visible. 

“If ever the hole gets in 
position it will empty very

quickly,” Magnan said, hope- 
fully. 

Suddenly, a brilliant white 
light flooded the glass cage. 
A sound went up from the 
spectators. 

“Quick, drop a chip,” some- 
one called. 

“You've only got ten sec- 
onds...” 

“Let go !” Magnan yelped. 

Retief sat silent, holding 
the grip, frowning up at the 
weight. The globe twirled 
faster now. Then the bright 
white light winked off. 

“A bluff!” Magnan gasped. 

“That's risky, stranger,” the 
gray-templed man said. 

The globe was turning rap- 
idly now, oscillating from 
side to side. The hole seemed 
to travel in a wavering loop, 
dipping lower, swinging up 
high, then down again. 

“It has to move to the bot- 
tom soon,” Magnan said. 
“Slow it down.” 

“The slower it goes, the 
longer it takes to get to the 
bottom,” someone said. 

There was a crackle and 
Retief stiffened. Magnan 
heard a sharp intake of 
breath. The globe slowed, and 
Retief shook his head, blink- 
ing. 

The broad-shouldered man 
glanced at a meter 

“You took pretty near a full 
jolt, that time,” he said. 

The hole in the globe was 
tracing an oblique course now, 
swinging to the center, then 
below. 



“A little longer,” Magnan 
said. 

“That's the best speed I 
ever seen on the Slam ball,” 
someone said. “How much 
longer can he hold it?” 

Magnan looked at Retief’s 
knuckles. They showed white 
against the grip. The globe 
tilted farther, swung around, 
then down ; two chips fell out, 
clattered down a chute and 
into a box. 

“We're ahead,” Magnan 
said. “Let's quit.” 

Retief shook his head. The 
globe rotated, dipped again; 
three chips fell. 

“She's ready,” someone 
called. 

“It's bound to hit soon,” an- 
other voice added excitedly. 
“Come on, Mister!” 

“Slow down,” Magnan said. 
“So it won't move past too 
quickly.” 

“Speed it up, before that 
lead block gets you,” some- 
one called. 

The hole swung high, over 
the top, then down the side. 
Chips rained out of the hole, 
six, eight. 

“Next pass,” a voice called. 

The white light flooded the 
cage. The globe whirled; the 
hole slid over the top, down, 
down... A chip fell, two 
more. 

Retief half rose, clamped 
his jaw and crushed the grip. 
Sparks flew. The globe 
slowed, chips spewing. It 
stopped, swung back, weight- 
ed by the mass of chips at the

bottom, and stopped again 
with the hole centered. 

Chips cascaded down the 
chute, filled the box before 
Retief, spilled on the floor. 
The crowd yelled. 

Retief released the grip and 
withdrew his arm at the same 
instant that the lead block 
slammed down. 

“Good lord,” Magnan said. 
“I felt that through the 
floor.” 

Retief turned to the broad- 
shouldered man. 

“This game’s all right for 
beginners,” he said. “But I’d 
like to talk a really big gam- 
ble. Why don’t we go to your 
office, Mr. Zorn?” 

fCV/DUR proposition inter- 
^ ests me,” Zorn said, 
grinding out the stump of his 
dope stick in a brass ashtray. 
“But there’s some angles to 
this I haven’t mentioned yet.” 

“You’re a gambler, Zorn, 
not a suicide,” Retief said. 
“Take what I’ve offered. The 
other idea was fancier, I 
agree, but it won’t work.” 

“How do I know you birds 
aren’t lying?” Zorn snarled. 
He stood up, strode up and 
down the room. “You walk 
in here and tell me I’ll have 
a task force on my neck, that 
the Corps won’t recognize my 
regime. Maybe you’re right. 
But I’ve got other contacts. 
They say different.” He 
whirled, ^stared at Retief. 

“I have pretty good assur- 
ance that once I put it over, 
the Corps will have to recog- 
GA*UM_ERS WORLD 



nize me as the legal govern- 
ment of Petreac. They won’t 
meddle in internal affairs.” 
“Nonsense,” Magnan spoke 
up. “The Corps will never 
deal with a pack of criminals 
calling themselves — ” 

“Watch your language, 
you!” Zorn rasped. 

“I’ll admit Mr. Magnan’s 
point is a little weak,” Retief 
said. “But you’re overlooking 
something. You plan to mur- 
der a dozen or so officers of 
the Corps Diplomatique Ter- 
restrienne along with the lo- 
cal wheels. The corps won’t 
overlook that. It can’t.” 

“Their tough luck they’re 
in the middle,” Zorn mut- 
tered. 

“Our offer is extremely 
generous, Mr. Zorn,” Magnan 
said. “The post you’ll get will 
pay you very well indeed. As 
against the certain failure of 
your planned coup, the choice 
should be simple.” 

Zorn eyed Magnan. “Offer- 
ing me a job — it sounds phony 
as hell. I thought you birds 
were goody-goody diplomats.” 
“It’s time you knew,” Re- 
tief said. “There’s no phonier 
business in the Galaxy than 
diplomacy.” 

“You’d better take it, Mr. 
Zorn,” Magnan said. 

“Don’t push me, Junior!” 
Zorn said. “You two walk 
into my headquarters empty- 
handed and big-mouthed. I 
don’t know what I’m talking 
to you for. The answer is no. 
N-I-X, no!” 



121 




“Who are you afraid of?” 
Retief said softly. 

Zorn glared at him. 

“Where do you get that 
‘afraid’ routine? I’m top man 
here!” 

“Don’t kid around, Zorn. 
Somebody’s got you under 
their thumb. I can see you 
squirming from here.” 

44T17THAT if I let your boys 
▼V alone?” Zorn said sud- 
denly. “The Corps won’t have 
anything to say then, huh?” 

“The Corps has plans for 
Petreac, Zorn. You aren’t part 
of them/ A revolution right 
now isn’t part of them. Hav- 
ing the Potentate and the 
whole Nenni caste slaught- 
ered isn’t part of them. Do I 
make myself clear?” 

“Listen,” Zorn said urgent- 
ly, pulling a chair around. 
“I’ll tell you guys a few 
things. You ever heard of a 
world they call Rotune?” 

“Certainly,” Magnan said. 
“It’s a near neighbor of yours. 
Another backward — that is, 
emergent — ” 

“Okay,” Zorn said. “You 
guys think I’m a piker, do 
you? Well, let me wise you 
up. The Federal Junta on 
Rotune is backing my play. 
I’ll be recognized by Rotune, 
and the Rotune fleet will 
stand by in case I need any 
help. I’ll present the C.D.T. 
with what you call a fait ac- 
compli” 

“What does Rotune get out 
of this? I thought they were 



your traditional enemies.” 
“Don’t get me wrong. I’ve 
got no use for Rotune; but 
our interests happen to coin- 
cide right now.” 

“Do they?” Retief smiled 
grimly. “You can spot a suck- 
er as soon as he comes 
through that door out there — 
but you go for a deal like 
this !” 

“What do you mean?” Zorn 
looked angrily at Retief. “It’s 
fool-proof.” 

“After you get in power, 
you’ll be fast friends with 
Rotune, is that it?” 

“Friends, hell! Just give me 
time to get set, and I’ll square 
a few things with that — ” 
“Exactly. And what do you 
suppose they have in mind 
for you?” 

“What .are you getting at?” 
“Why is Rotune interested 
in your take-over?” 

Zorn studied Retief’s face. 
“I’ll tell you why,” he said. 
“It’s you birds. You and your 
trade agreement. You’re here 
to tie Petreac into some kind 
of trade combine. That cuts 
Rotune out. Well, we’re do- 
ing all right out here. We 
don’t need any commitments 
to a lot of fancy-pants on the 
other side of the Galaxy.” 
“That’s what Rotune has 
sold you, eh?” Retief said, 
smiling. 

“Sold, nothing!” 

Z ORN ground out his dope- 
stick, lit another. He 
snorted angrily. 



122 



KEITH LAUMER 




"Okay; what’s your idea?” 
he asked after a moment. 

"You know what Petreac is 
getting in the way of imports 
as a result of the agreement?” 
"Sure. A lot of junk.” 

"To be specific,” Retief 
said, "there’ll be 50,000 Ta- 
tone B-3 dry washers; 100,000 
Glo-float motile lamps ; 

100.000 Earthworm Minor 
garden cultivators ; 25,000 
Veco space heaters; and 

75.000 replacement elements 
for Ford Monomeg drives.” 

"Like I said. A lot of junk.” 
Retief leaned back, looking 
sardonically at Zorn. "Here’s 
the gimmick, Zorn,” he said. 
"The Corps is getting a little 
tired of Petreac and Rotune 
carrying on their two-penny 
war out here. Your privateers 
have a nasty habit of picking 
on innocent bystanders. After 
studying both sides, the 
Corps has decided Petreac 
would be a little easier to do 
business with. So this trade 
agreement was worked out. 
The Corps can’t openly spon- 
sor an arms shipment to a 
belligerent. But personal ap- 
pliances are another story.” 
"So what do we do— plow 
’em under with back-yard cul- 
tivators?” Zorn looked at Re- 
tief, puzzled. "What’s the 
point?” 

"You take the sealed mon- 
itor unit from the washer, the 
repeller field generator from 
the lamp, the converter con- 
trol from the cultivator, et 
cetera, et cetera. You fit these 



together according to some 
very simple instructions. 
Presto! You have one hun- 
dred thousand Standard-class 
Y hand blasters. Just the 
thing to turn the tide in a % 
stalemated war fought with 
obsolete arms.” 

"Good lord!” Magnan said. 
"Retief, are you — ” 

"I have to tell him,” Retief 
said. "He has to know what 
he’s putting his neck into.” 
"Weapons, hey?” Zorn 
said. "And Rotune knows 
about it?” 

"Sure they know about it. 
It’s not too hard to figure 
out. And there’s more. They 
want the CDT delegation in- 
cluded in the massacre for a 
reason. It will put Petreac 
out of the picture; the trade 
agreement will go to Rotune; 
and you and your new regime 
will find yourselves looking 
down the muzzles of your 
own blasters.” 

Zorn threw his dope-stick 
to the floor with a snarl. 

"I should have smelled 
something when that Rotune 
smoothie made his pitch.” 
Zorn looked at his watch. 

"I’ve got two hundred 
armed men in the palace. 
We’ve got about forty min- 
utes to get over there before 
the rocket goes up.”

word,” Zorn said. “Just in 
case.” 

“Let me caution you 
against any . ah . slip-ups, 
Mr. Zorn,” Magnan said. 
“The Nenni are not to be 
molested — ” 

Zorn looked at Retief. 

“Your friend talks too 
much,” he said. “I’ll keep my 
end of it. He’d better keep 
his.” 

“Nothing’s happened yet, 
you’re sure?” Magnan said. 

“I’m sure,” Zorn said. “Ten 
minutes to go. Plenty of 
time.” 

“I’ll just step into the salon 
to assure myself that all is 
well,” Magnan said. 

“Suit yourself,” Zorn said. 
“Just stay clear of the kitch- 
en, or you’ll get your throat 
cut.” He sniffed at his dope- 
stick. “What’s keeping 
Shoke?” he muttered. 

Magnan stepped to a tall 
glass door, eased it open and 
poked his head through the 
heavy draperies. As he moved 
to draw back, a voice was 
faintly audible. Magnan 
paused, head still through the 
drapes. 

“What’s going on there?” 
Zorn rasped. He and Retief 
stepped up behind Magnan. 

“ — breath of air, ha-ha,” 
Magnan was saying. 

“Well, come along, Mag- 
nan !” Ambassador Crodfol- 
ler’s voice snapped. 

Magnan shifted from one 
foot to the other then pushed 
through the drapes. 



“Where’ve you been, Mr. 
Magnan?” The Ambassador’s 
voice was sharp. 

“Oh... ah... a slight acci- 
dent, Mr. Ambassador.” 

“What’s happened to your 
shoes? Where are your insig- 
nia and decorations?” 

“I — ah — spilled a drink on 
them. Sir. Ah — listen...” 

The sound of an orchestra 
came up suddenly, blaring a 
fanfare. 

Zorn shifted restlessly, ear 
against the glass. 

“What’s your friend pull- 
ing?” he rasped. “I don’t like 
this.” 

“Keep cool, Zorn,” Retief 
said. “Mr. Magnan is doing a 
little emergency salvage on 
his career.” 

The music died away with 
a clatter. 

“ — My God,” Ambassador 
Crodfoller’s voice was faint. 
“Magnan, you’ll be knighted 
for this. Thank, God you 
reached me. Thank God it’s 
not too late. I’ll find some ex- 
cuse. I’ll get a gram off at 
once.” 

“But you—” 

“It’s all right, Magnan. 
You were in time. Another 
ten minutes and the agree- 
ment would have been signed 
and transmitted. The wheels 
would have been put in mo- 
tion. My career ruined...” 

Retief felt a prod at his 
back. He turned. 

“Doublecrossed,” Zorn said 
softly. “So much for the word 
of a diplomat.” 



<424 



KEITH LAUMER 




R ETIEF looked at the 
short-barreled needier in 
Zorn's hand. 

“I see you hedge your bets, 
Zorn," he said. 

“We’ll wait here," Zorn 
said, “until the excitement’s 
over inside. I would want to 
attract any attention right 
now.” 

“Your politics are still 
lousy, Zorn. The picture 
hasn’t changed. Your coup 
hasn’t got a chance.” 

“Skip it. I’ll take up one 
problem at a time.” 

“Magnan’s mouth has a 
habit of falling open at the 
wrong time—” 

“That’s my good luck that 
I heard it. So there’ll be no 
agreement, no guns, no fat 
job for Tammany Zorn, hey? 
Well, I can still play it the 
other way. What have I got 
to lose?” 

With a movement too quick 
to follow, R e t i e f ’ s hand 
chopped down across Zorn’s 
wrist. The needier clattered 
as Zorn reeled, and then Re- 
lief ’s hand clamped Zorn’s 
arm and whirled him around. 

“In answer to your last 
question,” Retief said, “your 
neck.” 

“You haven’t got a chance, 
doublecrosser,” Zorn gasped. 

“Shoke will be here in a 
minute,” Retief said. “Tell 
him it’s all off." 

“Twist harder. Mister," 
Zorn said. “Break it off at 
the shoulder. I’m telling him 
nothing !” 

GAMBLER S WORLD 



“The kidding’s over, Zorn,” 
Retief said. “Call it off or I’ll 
kill you." 

“I believe you,” Zorn said. 
“But you won’t have long to 
remember it.” 

“All the killing will be for 
nothing,” Retief said. “You’ll 
be dead and the Rotunes. will 
step into the power vacuum.” 

“So what? When I die, the 
world ends." 

“Suppose I make you an- 
other offer, Zorn?” 

“Why would it be any bet- 
ter than the last one, chisel- 
er?" 

Retief released Zorn’s arm, 
pushed him away, stooped 
and picked up the needier. 

“I could kill you, Zorn. 
You know that." 

“Go ahead!” 

Retief reversed the needier, 
held it out. 

“I’m a gambler too, Zorn. 
I’m gambling you’ll listen to 
what I have to say." 

Zorn snatched the gun, 
stepped back. He looked at 
Retief. 

“That wasn’t the smartest 
bet you ever made. Mister; 
but go ahead. You’ve got 
maybe ten seconds.” 

“Nobody doublecrossed 
you, Zorn. Magnan put his 
foot in it. Too bad. Is that a 
reason to kill yourself and a 
lot of other people who’ve bet 
their lives on you?” 

‘“They gambled and lost. 
Tough." 

“Maybe you haven’t lost yet 
— if you don’t quit.”

“Get to the point!” 

Retief spoke earnestly for 
a minute and a half. Zorn 
stood, gun aimed, listening. 
Then both men turned as 
footsteps approached along 
the terrace. A fat* man in a 
yellow sarong padded up to 
Zorn. 

Zorn tucked the needier in 
his waistband. 

“Hold everything, Shoke,” 
he said. “Tell the boys to put 
the knives away. Spread the 
word fast. It’s all off.” 

itY want to commend you, 
J-R e t i e f,” Ambassador 
Crodfoller said expansively. 
“You mixed very well at last 
night’s affair. Actually, I was 
hardly aware of your pres- 
ence.” 

“I’ve been studying Mr. 
Magnan’s work,” Retief said. 

“A good man, Magnan. In 
a crowd, he’s virtually invisi- 
ble.” 

“He knows when to disap- 
pear all, right.” 

“This has been in many 
ways a model operation, Re- 
tief.” The Ambassador patted 
his paunch contentedly. “By 
observing local social customs 
and blending harmoniously 
with the court, I’ve succeeded 
in establishing a fine, friend- 
ly, working relationship with 
the Potentate.” 

“I understand the agree- 
ment has been postponed.” 
The Ambassador chuckled. 
“The Potentate’s a crafty one. 
Through. .ah... a special 



study I have been conducting, 
I learned last night that he 
had hoped to, shall I say, ‘put 
one over’ on the Corps.” 

“Great heavens,” Retief 
said. 

“Naturally, this placed me 
in a difficult position. It was 
my task to quash this gam- 
bit, without giving any indi- 
cation that I was aware of its 
existence.” 

“A hairy position indeed,” 
Retief said. 

“Quite casually, I informed 
the Potentate that certain 
items which had been includ- 
ed in the terms of the agree- 
ment had been deleted and 
others substituted. I admired 
him at that moment, Retief. 
He took it coolly — appearing 
completely indifferent — per- 
fectly dissembling his very 
serious disappointment. 

“I noticed him dancing 
with three girls wearing a 
bunch of grapes apiece. He’s 
very agile for a man of his 
bulk.” 

“You mustn’t discount the 
Potentate ! Remember, be- 
neath that mask of frivolity, 
he had absorbed a bitter 
blow.” 

“He had me fooled,” Retief 
said. 

“Don’t feel badly; I con- 
fess at first I failed to sense 
his shrewdness.” The Ambas- 
sador nodded and moved off 
along the corridor. 

Retief turned and went 
into an office. Magnan looked 
up from his desk.

"Ah,” he said. "Retief. I've 
been meaning to ask you. 
About the. .ah. * .biasters. 
Are you — ?” 

Retief leaned on Magnan's 
desk, looked at him. 

"I thought that was to be 
our little secret.” 

"Well, naturally I — ” Mag- 
nan closed his mouth, swal- 
lowed. “How is it, Retief,” he 
said sharply, "that you were 
aware of this blaster busi- 
ness, when the Ambassador 
himself wasn't?” 

"Easy,” Retief said. "I 
made it up.” 

"You what !” M a g n a n 
looked wild. “But the agree- 
ment — it's been revised! Am- 
bassador Crodfoller has gone 
on record ...” 

“Too bad. Glad I didn't tell 
him about it.” 

M AGNAN leaned back and 
closed his eyes. 

"It was big of you to take 
all the. .blame,” Retief said, 
"when the Ambassador was 
talking about knighting peo- 
ple.” 

Magnan opened his eyes. 
"What about that gambler, 
Zorn? Won't he be upset?” 
"It's all right,” Retief said. 
"I made another arrangement. 
The business about making 
blasters out of common com- 
ponents wasn't completely 
imaginary. You can actually 
do it, using parts from an old- 
fashioned disposal unit.” * 
"What good will that do 
him?” Magnan whispered, 

GAMBLER S WORLD 



looking nervous. "We're not 
shipping in any old-fashioned 
disposal units.” 

“We don't need to,” Retief 
said. "They're already in- 
stalled in the palace kitchen 
— and in a few thousand oth- 
er places, Zorn tells me.” 

“If this ever leaks... * 
Magnan put a hand to his 
forehead. 

"I have his word on it that 
the Nenni slaughter is out. 
This place is ripe for a 
change. Maybe Zorn is what 
it needs.” 

“But how can we know?” 
Magnan yelped. "How can we 
be sure?” 

“We can't,” Retief said. 
“But it's not up to the Corps 
to meddle in Petreacs' inter- 
nal affairs.” He leaned over, 
picked up Magnan's desk 
lighter and lit a cigar. He 
blew a cloud of smoke toward 
the ceiling. "Right?” 

Magnan looked at him, nod- 
ded weakly. "Right.” 

“I'd better be getting along 
to my desk,” Retief said. 
"Now that the Ambassador 
feels that I'm settling down 
at last — ” 

“Retief,” Magnan said, "to- 
night, I implore you. Stay 
out of the kitchen — no matter 
what.” 

Retief raised his eyebrows. 

“I know,” Magnan said. "If 
you hadn't interfered, we'd all 
have had our throats cut. But 
at least,” he added, “we” have 
died in accordance with reg- 
ulations I” END

Groverzb knew what he wanted — 
peace and quiet. He was willing 
to scream his head off for it! 



QUIET 

PLEASE 



By KEVIN SCOTT 



T HE big man eased the 
piano off his back and 
stood looking at Groverzb. 

“You ain’t gonna like it 
here.” He mopped his face. 
“Boy, will I ever be glad to 
get off this cockeyed planet.” 
Groverzb pushed at his 
spectacles, sniffed, and said, 
“Quite.” 

The big man said, “Ain’t no 
native here over three feet 
tall. And they got some crazy 
kind of communication. They 
don’t talk.” 

Groverzb said, “Quiet.” 
“Uh?” 

“Precisely why I am here. 
I,” said Groverzb, sniffing 
again, “loathe conversation.” 
“Oh. Well.” He left. 

Alone, Groverzb surveyed 
his realm. The house was the 



shell of what had formerly 
been a Little People apart- 
ment building. Ceilings, floors 
and walls had been removed 
to form one large room. The 
tiny doors and windows had 
been sealed, and a single win- 
dow and door had been cut 
into the shell for Groverzb’s 
use. Crude, but serviceable. 

Groverzb walked to the 
window and looked down the 
slope. Little People buildings 
dotted the landscape, and the 
people themselves scurried si- 
lently about. Yes, thought 
Groverzb, it would do nice- 
ly. He had brought an ade- 
quate food-tablet supply. He 
would finish, without the dis- 
traction of voices, his beauti- 
ful concerto. He would return 
to Earth famous and happy.

Armed with paper and pen- 
cils, he went to the piano, 
having decided to enlarge 
upon the theme in the second 
movement. His mind knew ex- 
actly how the passage should 
run, and he swiftly covered 
the paper with sharp, angu- 
lar notes. Then he triumph- 
antly lifted his hands and be- 
gan to play what he had writ- 
ten. 

He jerked back from the 
keyboard, his hair on end, his 
teeth, on edge, his ears 
screaming with the mass of 
sounds he had produced. He 
looked at his hands, peered 
at the score, adjusted his 
spectacles and tried again. 

Fm tired, he thought, re- 
coiling in horror from the 
racket. A food tablet and a 
nap will remedy the situation. 

VUTHEN he awoke, Gro- 
** verzb walked to the win- 
dow, refreshed. A violet glow 
had replaced the harsh yellow 
light of day. At the foot of 
the slope, the Little People 
dashed to and fro, but no 
voice broke the peaceful quiet 
of evening. 

With a sigh of satisfaction, 
Groverzb went to the piano. 
Gently, he struck the keys. 
Blatant, jumbled noise filled 
the room. 

Breathing hard, Groverzb 
rose and gingerly lifted the 
spinet’s lid. No, nothing amiss 
there. Good felts, free ham- 
mers, solid sounding board- 
must be out of tune. 

Groverzb closed the lid, sat 
QUIET, PLEASE 



down and struck a single note. 
A clear tone sang out. He 
moved chromatically ^ up and 
down the scale. Definitely not 
out of tune. 

He shifted the score, 
glanced uneasily at the keys 
and began to play. Discord 
immediately pierced his ear- 
drums. 

He clapped his hands over 
his ears and leaped wildly 
from the piano bench. The 
trip, he decided frantically. 
It must have affected my 
hearing. 

He flung himself from the 
house and down the slope. 
The Little People scattered, 
staring. He charged into the 
administration building and 
clutched the lapels of a uni- 
formed official. 

“A doctor !” he gasped. 
“Now! This minuter 

The official raised his eye- 
brows and removed Groverzb’s 
hands with distaste: 

“It’s a little late in the 
day,” he drawled, “but may- 
be the doc up on the top 
floor — ” 

Groverzb flew up the stairs 
and into the doctor’s office. 
The doctor’s face lit up. 

“A patient J” he exclaimed. 
“Capital! What seems to be 
the trouble? Food poisoning? 
Shouldn’t eat the food here. 
Garbage. Appendix? Heart at- 
tack?” 

“Stop talking, you idiot, 
it’s my ears!” 

Obviously disappointed, the 
doctor nevertheless poked and 
peered at Groverzb’s ears. 

129 




“No,” he said finally. “A 
trifle big, yes. But nothing 
wrong with them.” 

“You’re sure?” 

“Absolutely. A pity. I’m 
getting a bit rusty.” 

With a groan, Groverzb 
staggered out of the building, 
back through town, and up 
the slope to his house. Seat- 
ing himself firmly on the 
bench he began to play. 

He shuddered. The noise 
was abominable. 

Suddenly his door burst 
open and a crowd of Little 
People rushed in. They pulled 
him off the bench and 
slapped angrily at his hands. 
Then, with cutters, they at- 
tacked the piano. 

“Here, stop that !” Gro- 
verzb screeched. “What do 
you think you’re doing?” 

The Little People pushed 
and dragged him out of the 
house, down the slope, 
through the town and into the 
launching bowl at the space- 
strip. The launching agent 
took one look and yelled, “Get 
the interpreter! On the dou-' 
ble !” 

The interpreter ran up and 
whipped something from his 
pocket. It looked like a min- 
iature piano skeleton. He 
tripped a hammer. There was 
a faint tinkle. Instantly one 
of the Little People produced 
a single miniature hammer 
and tapped it rapidly against 
his skull. The interpreter 
tripped another hammer. A 
second little one responded. 

130 



S UDDENLY one of the Lit- 
tie People ran over and 
tripped all the interpreter’s 
hammers simultaneously. The 
Little People winced. 

“Oh,” said the interpreter. 
“Well, it’s their planet.” He 
hustled Groverzb out to a 
freight ship that was warming 
up for takeoff. 

“Is everyone insane?” Gro- 
verzb croaked. “I demand to 
know what this is all about!” 
The interpreter shoved Gro- 
verzb into the ship. 

“They say you talk too 
much !” he yelled, as he 
slammed the door. END
