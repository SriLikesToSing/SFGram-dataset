A popular storytelling magazine like 
FICTION is as indispensable as your life 
support system or gravity pack. When a 
four week dust storm is tearing away at my 
unit, I just relax with a good mystery or 
western. Some guys read poetry on those 
long buggy rides to perimeter points, so 
that their style with the females doesn't go 
stale. The woman I room with is always 
paging around for the sexy parts. Drives me 
nuts...My girl-friend is crazy about gothics 
and crossword puzzles. And of course there 
is always the science-fiction if your tastes 
incline in that direction. Personally, I like 
the reviews. When I touch earth again, I'm 
going to get a nice little job teaching 
literature at a girl's school and I've got to 
keep informed... That's the way it is..."

STRATEGY & TACTICS is a magazine. It's 
also a tool: a time machine that enables you 
to replay the crucial events — past, present, 
and tutors— that shape our lives. 

Now, instead ol merely reading about what’s 
happening, you can explore and experience 
the alternatives and decision points through 
the technique ol Conflicts! mutation. 


Conflict Simulation is a way of analyzing a 
political or military conflict situation. A way 
that is as intellectually stimulating as a game 
of chess, and as thorough as a written analysis. 

Through the use of the Conflict Simulation 
(or "game”) format, the conflict situation is 
re-created - so that you are in a position to 
make the vital decisions and. in Ihe game at 
lent, change the way things were. are. or 
will be. 

VRmK you |it 

STRATEGY & TACTICS magazine is publish- 
ed bi-monthly. Each issue contains: 

* A ready-to-play conflict-simulation game 
with a 22 x 29 ' pteying surface, die-cut play- 


ing pieces, and complete rules. 

* An analytical article on the same subject as 
the game in that issue. 

* Other feature articles on historical and 
military subjects. 

* Gama and book reviews, commentary on 
existing games, and discussions of subscribers’ 
questions. 

The magazine is 48+ pages long, and all 
material is handled in a highly organized (and 
easily understandable) graphic format. 

Games recently published in STRATEGY & 
TACTICS were: QBUNT (ground combat in 
Vietnam). LOST BATTLES (tactical combat in 
Russia. 1941-44), USN (the war in the Pacific, 
1941-43). COUBAT COMMAND (tactical com- 
bat in Western Europe. 1944). 

We also publish a separate line of conflict- 
simuletion games, which you will find listed in 
Ihe coupon.

TORCHSHIPS 

NOW! 


ROBERT 0. ENZMANN & 
RICHARD C. HOAGLAND 


(With invaluable assistance 
provided by Spike MacPhee, 
Glen Blacow, and Northeast 
Cryonics Associates) 

II 

E very two years or so, for over 
a decade, NASA’s center for 
unmanned exploration of the solar 
system located at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory of California’s Institute 
of Technology, has thrown a party. 
Or so it has seemed. 

From all over the world we would 
gather, marvelling, in JPL’s Von 
Karman Auditorium as another 
NASA electronic miracle relayed 
back television from some remote 
corner of the solar system and 
made obsolete another file-drawer 
of data on the planets. 

It was party-like. Friends, cor- 


respondents and scientists whose 
diverse travels seldom allow them 
to- cross paths, met under the pale 
ion-glow of TV monitors as pictures 
of Earth’s sister worlds were paint- 
ed on the screens. And between the 
briefings and the “instant science 
reported to our waiting tape re- 
corders and cameras, we would 
talk. 

It was in this atmosphere that the 
idea for the now-famous Pioneer 10 
plaque was born. Here, someone — 
only half-facetiously — suggested to 
Wernher von Braun that they had a 
plan, as the pictures came back 
from Mariner 9 orbiting Mars, to 
reprogram the computer handling 
the dcjtfa into painting a large port- 
hole on one of the Martian 
moons — thereby insuring him all 
the money he needed for a Martian 
expedition! And it was here, one 


79 



evening, that some of us tried to 
figure out how it was that, a good 
twenty years ahead of schedule — 
according to science-fiction predic- 
tions of such events — we were wit- 
ness to mankind’s reaching out to 
its celestial backyard. This was not 
the way it was supposed to happen. 
[See Heinlein, Asimov, and others 
of the Golden Decade of science fic- 
tion after World War II.] 

Looking back now, that unease, 
that feeling of discontent which 
some of us shared in the midst of 
real-time events beyond one’s wild- 
est dreams, was well-founded. The 
Conquest of Space, as it had been 
named by the aforementioned 
visionaries, had an order and logic 
which actual developments on the 
Space Frontier have never had. It is 
probably this lack of logic and 
order which doomed Man’s first 
push into space to a brief, nova- 
like existence. 

In the Golden Decade of SF 
prophecy, space stations preceded 
earth-orbit assembly of the first 
lunar expedition; and a working 
version of the space shuttle pre- 
ceded space stations. Planetary ex- 
ploration, by manned expeditions, 
went forth only after establishment 
of the first lunar base. And all was 
founded on sound economic need, 
from the communications activities 
of the stations to the weather fore- 
casting made possible by the ad- 
vantageous presence of meteorolo- 
gists in orbit. That was how it was 
supposed to happen. 

Over Irish coffee in La Canada, 
just down the street from Von Kar- 
man, some of us spoke with wonder 
of the human footprints immor- 
talized in moondust twenty years 


before even so astute a prophet as 
Arthur Clarke had estimated that 
it would he so. Wasn’t it amazing 
how even science fiction writers had 
been so wrong, we mused smugly? 

What was amazing was that we 
actually could have been so blind. 

What would be the current 
American attitude toward space ex- 
ploration if SKYLAB, with its dar- 
ing rescue, its earth-oriented pho- 
tography, and its pioneering space 
manufacturing techniques, had 
been first to capture the public 
imagination, followed by Apollo? 
What if a reuseable shuttle and 
been an initial goal, in place of the 
Saturn V? What if . 

Such speculation is obviously 
useless. The Space Age was born 
and shaped through political neces- 
sity and international rivalry. That 
it was probably doomed by its 
structure is academic. The last 
fifteen years have occurred, as we 
have seen them. 

They were not wasted. And they 
have formed an appropriate ,and 
priceless prologue to what is about 
to happen: mankind’s explosive ac- 
ceptance and utilization of the solar 
system, fueled by the unlimited 
power of thermonuclear fusion. 
The true Space Age is about to 
dawn. 

$ $ $ $ $ $ 

( What follows is the continuation of 
that highly edited conversation be- 
gun in the previous issue. Ed.) 

HOAGLAND: Robert, you and 
I — many times — have discussed 
probable events, their timing and 
sequence, leading to what you have 
called the “urbanization” of the 
solar system . 


80 


IF 



ENZMANN: (interrupting with a 
grimace) An ugly word. 

HOAGLAND: True, because it 
gives the impression of an inter- 
planetary Los Angeles, heaven for- 
bid. Even I, who wouldn’t waste 
many tears on a few high rises on 
the sun side of Mercury, recoil from 
the images that word conjures up. 

ENZMANN: The urbanization 
of space is but one step in a total 
process — the domination of solar 
space by mankind. It will occur, as 
1 see it, as outlined in, the following 
sequence: 

I — Unmanned and manned entry 
(, Sputnik , Mariner, and Mer- 
cury- A polio) 

II — Relatively easy access through 
unmanned and manned sta- 
tions 

(Applications satellite sys- 
tems) 

(SKYLAB) 

III — Permanent earth orbital facil- 
ities founded on space-based 
economies 

(True beginnings of private 
enterprise investment in the 
solar system) 

IV — Urbanization 

(The stage where all choice 
locations are occupied with 
orbital cities, manufacturing 
complexes, and mobile, 
apartment-like units filling 
ail available synchronous or- 
bits, trojan points, etc.) 
(Further progress will consist 
of recycling unwanted struc- 
tures into larger systems — a 
process similar to renovation 
on Manhattan Island) 


V — A Solar System Megalopolis 
(Unromantic as any mega- 
lopolis on the surface of 
Earth today, except for a 
vastly higher material stan- 
dard of living, with prob- 
able fascinatingly commen- 
surate evolution of social sys- 
tems) 

HOAGLAND: You are talking 
about an eventual Los Angelesation 
of the solar system! 

ENZMANN:' We have already 
begun. We are already out there in 
the solar system and we shall con- 
tinue to spread. With the advent of 
fusion the process will really take 
off. And just in time. Imagine what 
the earth will become if she alone, 
of all the planets and ecological 
niches in the solar system, is forced 
to carry the enormous burden of 
providing the material wealth 
necessary to house, clothe, feed, 
and amuse the seven billion human 
beings who will live here by the year 
2.000! At present, with a world 
population of only about 3.5 billion 
(and only 200 million of us using 
1/3 of everything), we are begin- 
ning to run out of certain material 
resources, such as fossil fuels and 
rare metals. Imagine the future if, 
trapped on this planet, without 
fusion energy, seven billion people 
demand a civilized life style, not 
merely an existence such as the 
majority of our 3.5 billion now 
strive to maintain. 

Which is better: the urbanization 
of the solar system and the return 
of the garden. Earth; or the preser- 
vation of Space in all its vast 
unused emptiness while humanity 
quietly (or unquietly, with nuclear 


TORCHSH1PS NOW! 


81 



weapons) goes mad in its limited 
planetary prison, destroying itself 
and the habitability of the earth, 
forever? 

The solar system is the only ap- 
propriate environment for an ad- 
vanced technical civilization. How- 
ever, even in the Era of Mega- 
lopolis, generations down the road, 
an observer would probably not 
casually detect that there was a 
single inhabited entity orbiting the 
sun. It would appear (as it has for 
the last five billion years) empty; 
lifeless, and serene — a timeless 
pageant of majestic planetary 
points moving against the stellar 
backdrop of infinity. 

And Earth? With the material 
foundation, manufacturing centers, 
and population growth of civiliza- 
tion removed from Earth, I en- 
vision our terrestrial home becom- 
ing a place of beauty like the lake- 
side retreats of China, various 
fabled gardens of the Middle East, 
the Cotswolds of England, and 
other present-day preserves of 
natural harmony and peace. Earth 
can become a vast preserve where 
independent cultures, life styles, 
and social orders can experiment 
among the greenery of the only 
natural home Man has in the entire 
solar system. 

“Urbanization” of the solar 
system a dirty word? It may be the 
process whereby Man at last be- 
comes a true humane being after 
almost four million years. Perhaps 
beyond Earth, with new rules, we’ll 
have a chance, at last to realize our 
true potential. 

HOAGLAND: You’re right, of 
course. It’s just that word “urbani- 
zation.” I have the feeling, Bob, 


that you are a prisoner of your own 
perspectives. Why does the end of 
the acquisition of the solar system 
have to be a griffT “megalopolis?” It 
seems to me that, on a scale of sys- 
tems-space-time encompassed by 
this vision, reasoning by analogy to 
an almost pre-industrial urban cul- 
ture confined to one planet can only 
yield inaccurate extrapolations of 
present urban life. (Wow, that was 
a mouthful!) 

ENZMANN: It actually doesn’t 
matter if I’m correct in each detail. 
Urbanization, of the solar system 
will take the pressure off Earth. It 
will not “mess up” the solar system; 
the scale 1 is simply too incredible for 
any of this to be noticeable on 
casual inspection. And the final re- 
sult of this next evolutionary step 
around the sun, whatever it is, will 
be preceded by several generations 
of fascinating exploration and early 
development. For some people — 
like myself — that is the exciting 
prospect. How wonderful to be able 
to live through, and take part in, 
the greatest adventure in the his- 
tory of Man! 

Moreover, it is an adventure 
which will never end. 

Overlapping mankind’s move- 
ment from one planet out into the 
planetary system orbiting our star 
will be a new and mightier age of 
high adventure, exploration, and 
settlement in a bubble with the sun 
as its center, expanding out into the 
Milky Way, nearly at light speed. It 
will be the next great leap of the 
torchships. And it is close. The 
majority of those reading this will 
live to see, and many will take part, 
in Man’s first efforts to send probes 
to the stars. It is even possible that 


82 


IF 



the first crewman of a starship 
destined to visit Alpha Centuri will 
be inspired by these very words to 
attempt that ultimate adventure. It 
is a nice thought . 

[En route upon an endless journey 
is Man’s first interstellar artifact — 
Pioneer 10. Before it can even leave 
the confines of the sun’s far-flung 
planetary system, crawling deeper 
and deeper into the eternal night 
which yawns before it, at a meager 
seven miles per second, the true 
interstellar craft of its creators will 
be flashing past, destined to travel 
light-years into the galaxy in the 
time it will have taken Pioneer 10 to 
reach the edge of the abyss. Eighty 
thousand years from now, Pioneer 
will reach the distance of the 
nearest stars. Waiting there to wel- 
come it may be a race of beings 
which, in searching through their 
history, will recognize the stellar 
system etched upon its plaque, 
pitted and time-worn. 

Pioneer will have spanned a 
breadth of time equivalent to that 
which separates Neanderthal from 
modern man. It may come as 
somewhat of a shock to its discover- 
ers, therefore, that this ancient arti- 
fact is a gift to them — not merely 
out of space, but from their for- 
gotten origins and their own 
legendary birth upon a place called 
Earth.] 

H oagland: We have presented 
the political and technical en- 
vironment which is about to bring 
forth the first true “space-drive” 
and its imminent effect upon our 
culture. I feel, therefore, that it is 


about time we got down to the heart 
of the matter, Robert, and de- 
scribed the fundamental break- 
through which will make it all pos- 
sible. How will a torchship work? 

ENZMANN: There has been a 
twenty-year world-wide effort to 
tame the elusive geni of fusion (an 
apt analogy because during that 
time the primary line of research 
was directed toward trapping a 
plasma within a strong magnetic 
“bottle” until enough of it could 
“fuse” to release more energy than 
the containment process used). It 
was twenty years marked by dogged 
perseverance, brilliant theoretical 
insight, and agonizing frustration 
as physicists practically had to in- 
vent a whole new branch of Physics, 
something with the unpronounce- 
able title — “Magnetohydrody- 
namics.” 

The essence of the problem was 
simple. For each new technical in- 
novation devised to contain the 
plasma long enough for fusion to 
occur, the plasma devised three 
new techniques to escape. It was 
somewhat like trying to trap an 
angry anaconda with rubber bands. 

Into this dismal arena (for pros- 
pects of controlled fusion seemed to 
be beyond the end of the century, 
until recently), a new idea was in- 
jected. Quite simply, it asked, “Is 
there anything in the rules of this 
exotic game which insists that 
fusion has to be a continuous pro- 
cess? Suppose, instead of pursuing 
the exceedingly difficult road of 
containing the plasma indefinitely, 
with fusion energy trickling out, we 
examine an alternative technique of 
compressing the plasma intermit- 
tently. If we do this sequentially

and often enough, the effect will be 
identical to a steady trickle of 
fusion power such as we have been 
laboriously pursuing with other 
techniques. The secret here is that 
all we have to do is hit that plasma 
hard enough, from all sides, and 
plain old inertia will do the rest. 
The result will be a fusion power 
plant somewhat similar to an inter- 
nal combustion engine where it is 
the average power of the eight se- 
quential explosions in the cylinders 
which moves the car. Of course, 
there is one problem: what are we 
going to hit the plasma with in the 
first place?” 

It was at this point that another 
technical breakthrough came to the 
rescue. Enter the LASER. It was 
suggested that intense light from a 
large laser, a source of precisely 
controllable electro-magnetic radi- 
ation, could be directed via suitable 
optics into a very small volume Of 
space. If, as the laser was fired, a 
tiny pellet of fuseable material (in 
this case, frozen deuterium-tritium) 
were dropped precisely into that 
tiny volume, the following would 
happen: 

The focused electro-magnetic 
radiation would exert a pressure on 
the pellet. Focused to such a small 
volume and arriving in such quan- 
tity, the prqssure would be enor- 
mous. But more important, the 
frozen deuterium (heavy isotopes of 
hydrogen, the most abundant ele- 
ment in the Universe) would absorb 
this energy at its surface which 
would, of course, be violently 
heated. It was Dr. John Nuckolls 
(of the Lawrence Radiation Labora- 
tory, attached to the Univ. of Calif.) 
who predicted what would happen. 


If the laser pulse is actually two 
pulses — a smaller pulse of energy 
followed immediately by the main 
blast — then the outside of the pellet 
will absorb the first pulse, vaporize, 
and thus surround the pellet with a 
sort of atmosphere. The main pulse 
of intense laser light, upon arriv- 
ing, will then further heat this “at- 
mosphere,” causing it to expand 
rapidly in all directions. At this 
stage, out tiny pellet of frozen 
deuterium resembles very much a 
tiny synthetic star with a super- 
heated atmosphere blowing off ex- 
plosively in all directions. Now, 
Newton enters the picture, for the 
reaction pressure to this explosive 
departure of the shell of gas sur- 
rounding the pellet drives shock- 
waves from all sides into the tiny, 
icy heart of this miniature “star.” 
These crushing pressures actually 
compress the center of the pellet 
into the densities and temperatures 
found within the centers of stars 
like our sun, a million miles across! 
Yet the star created in the center of 
the vacuum chamber is only barely 
visible to the naked eye, a few 
tenths of a millimeter in diameter. 

At such densities and pressures 
the deuterium-tritium mixture 
fuses, the nuclei colliding and 
transmuting themselves into helium 
in a violent analogue of processes 
that take millions of years to com- 
plete in “normal-sized stars” such 
as our sun. The liberated fusion 
energy blasts apart the heart of this 
newly created “star,” sending the 
reactants in all directions at appre- 
ciable fractions of the speed of 
light. The tiny star explodes, end- 
ing its brief existence — as do many 
of the real stars a trillion times as

large — as a supernova. Total time 
from creation to the death of this 
artificial star is less than a 
millionth of a second. 

If this process were accomplished 
successfully, the released energy 
would be greater than that required 
to fire the laser, maintain the 
vacuum, and keep the fuel frozen 
in precisely deliverable pellet quan- 
tities. Repetition of the entire 
sequence at rates ranging from 
once per second to a hundred times 
per second would provide for the 
“average” flow of energy envisioned 
previously. 

There is enough deuterium on 
Earth alone to provide essentially 
unlimited energy for the remaining 
lifetime of the sun. This is readily 
agreed upon by a wide spectrum of 
energy and environmental experts. 
However, what some may have ap- 
parently failed to consider, is that 
there are stores of deuterium within 
the rest of the solar system which 
dwarf our terrestrial supply (which 
would come primarily from 
seawater.) One of the moons of 
Jupiter, Callisto, for instance, 
which Pioneer 10 has revealed to 
have a density of only 1.65, seems 
to be a satellite with a 3,000 mile 
diameter, composed essentially of 
ice! In that ice, there is a vast 
supply of deuterium waiting to be 
mined. Little thought is necessary 
to realize that with fusion, which 
gives us the solar system through 
fusion rockets, we will discover 
enormous quantities of fuel beyond 
the “meager” quantity presently on 
Earth. No, energy is decidedly not a 
problem of the future.

naturally occurred to an awful lot 
of people at about the same time 
that if you aim a high-power laser 
through magnifying glass at a 
deuterium pellet, fusion will be in 
hand . Those same people were 
shortly seen rapidly retreating be- 
hind their office doors, biting their 
thumbs with a vacant look, pound- 
ing their heads against the nearest 
convenient hard object, or just 
standing staring down at their shoe- 
laces. Word quickly spread (bad 
news may exceed light speed under 
certain circumstances) that what 
you achieved when you aimed a 
high-power laser at a deuterium 
pellet through a magnifying glass 
or^ny other lens system, was not ^ i 
fusion reaction, but a mad 
scramble of white-coated laboratory 
personnel for the cover of the near 
desks, benches, closets, and lavo- 
tories as the precision optics 
promptly exploded in about a 
million high temperature frag- 
ments, thus wiping out both the ex- 
periment and initial high hopes for 
fusion from lasers. 


TORCHSHIPS NOW! 


85 


The problem, of course, was dis- 
continuities in the glass. At the 
energy densities emitted by the 
lasers in question, the slightest 
imperfection (and even the finest 
optical glass is not perfect) absorbs 
enough energy to flash instantly 
into vapor, shattering the lens. 
These lasers had been used in an 
M.I.T. project designed to blast 
tunnels through solid granite! They 
had shattered cobblestones into 
screaming shards of high velocity 
shrapnel and had punched through 
inch-thick destroyer plate. The 
power in these beams exceeds that 
of the sun by factors approaching 
the millions. No lens system could 
have the perfect transparency 
necessary to withstand even the 
shortest pulse of these hellish sys- 
tems, not even for the billionths 
(10'’) or trillionths (10' 12 ) of a 
second it would take to produce the 
deuterium “star.” Fusion, ignited 
by the “match” of the laser, 
seemed impossible to achieve for 
the very reasons which had first 
made it so attractive. How do you 
set off a reaction with a match you 
cannot hold? 

HOAGLAND: That’s unfair. 
You keep posing questions I know 
the answers to. Before you tell 
everybody, let me review something 
else: 

We’ve been tossing around the 
term “fusion” pretty freely. 
Perhaps we should define precisely 
what fusion is. Most stars in the 
Universe, globs of matter (pri- 
marily hydrogen), in the range of 
several million miles across and 
several million times the mass of 
the earth, shine by internally 
generated energy, energy derived 


from so-called fusion reactions — 
those nuclear events that smash 
light elements together to produce 
heavier elements and energy. In the 
’sun, fusion turns hydrogen into 
helium, with an energy excess that 
eventually works its way the half- 
million miles or so to the surface of 
the sun, causing it to shine. Thus, 
the stars exist for periods ranging 
from millions to billions of years, 
depending on a complicated rela- 
tionship of mass to luminosity 
which determines how rapidly a 
given star will use up its hydrogen 
fuel and thus continue to “live.” 
Stars, such as the sun, which still 
have plenty of hydrogen to draw 
upon for fusion, are referred to as 
“main sequence” stars. 

Now, relating all this to the ex- 
periment Dr. Nuckolls described, 
the internal densities of the pro- 
posed fusion “stars” in the labora- 
tory are similar to the internal 
densities of real main-sequence 
stars. Right? 

ENZMANN: Right. About 10 
grams/cm 3 . 

HOAGLAND: But without the 
huge masses and resultant gravita- 
tional fields to hold them together, 
such as actual stars possess, these 
laboratory creations promptly ex- 
plode, so they are only duplicates of 
the real thing for fleeting millionths 
of a second, as opposed to billions 
of years for the sun, a main se- 
quence star. 

ENZMANN: Right. 

HOAGLAND: As a real star 
evolves, after it has used its initial 
supply of hydrogen it shrinks in- 
ternally, heats up internally, and 
releases even higher amounts of 
energy from a new set of fusion re- 


86 


IF 



actions, now involving heavier ele- 
ments. Is that correct? 

ENZMANN: You know it is. 
What are you getting at? 

HOAG LAND: Is it possible to go 
beyond the energy release level of 
the Main Sequence star stage, to 
duplicate the density and energy 
release of later stages in a star’s 
evolution, such as the Red Giant 
phase, or the White Dwarf phase, 
or even the final plateau of most 
stars — the Neutron Star with its im- 
possible densities ranging up to 
10 1S grams/cm 3 ? 

ENZMANN: Now you’re asking 
the leading questions. Let’s save 
our discussion of the total annihila- 
tion of matter for a later article! 
For now let us return to the 
apparently insoluble problem of 
how you use a laser to set off fusion. 

If the problem of the lens could 
be surmounted, Man would suc- 
ceed in an incredible quest — bring- 
ing the stars, essentially, to Earth, 
harnessing their unlimited potential 
to solve Man’s most threatening 
problems for all time. But to suc- 
ceed, the problem of the lens had to 
have its solution. 

The answer, as with all answers 
in the Universe to fundamental 
problems, was the picture of 
elegant simplicity: instead of at- 
tempting to focus the laser with a 
lens, use a mirror! With a suitable 
mirror system, the ravening power 
of one, ten, or a hundred laser 
systems could be spread out across 
a reflecting surface so that the 
power density per unit of area was 
well below the 1‘evel required even to 
significantly raise the temperature 
of the mirror. Then, with appro- 
priate geometry, this dilute radia- 


tion could be brought to a needle- 
point focus on the deuterium tar- 
get. Result: FUSION. Simple. Ele- 
gant. Practical. 

HO AG LAND: You’re not going 
to tell everybody it’s all done with 
mirrors! 

ENZMANN: No, you’re going to. 
I like to think the first solution was 
the result of our work in Northeast 
Cryonics, but that isn’t quite cor- 
rect. Perhaps, however, ours, I feel, 
is one of the least expensive and 
most elegant solutions. One of our 
designs, in fact, can be seen in 
Freff s illustration for this article. 

The secret of fusion-by-laser lies 
in discovering the correct geometry 
for the mirror system, a geometry 
which will first dilute the radiation 
from lasers of incredible power, 
lasers which are now being con- 
structed or are within sight of our 
present state-of-the-art. With those 
two tools, creation in a fusion 
reactor of actual “stars” identical 
in every respect to those we see 
spangling the night sky will become 
a reality. And a new Age will have 
begun for mankind. That is the 
scientific breakthrough now only 
instants away by the standards of 
the cosmic clock^ 

HOAGLAND: And almost no 
one realizes! ■ Talk about revolu- 
tions. And torchships . .? 

ENZMANN: Examine carefully, 
if you will, the diagram I alluded to 
previously. You will notice that 
laser energy enters from two 
regions, is combined by appropriate 
optical flats, then flashes down into 
a conical mirror protected from de- 
structive heating through a process 
identical to the reason we get cold 
in the winter and hot in the

summer — grazing incidence of 
incoming energy. The ring of laser 
energy (since, of course, this system 
is three-dimensional) is reflected all 
along the mirror length, as you can 
see, and is brought to a tiny pin- 
point focus of searing power at the 
precise special point where it will 
impact a pellet of deuterium mix- 
ture. 

Now, note very carefully. The 
end of this arrangement of optics, 
lasers, and hyperbolic mirror is 
open to space! And what is a con- 
tainer, closed on three sides, in 
which a high -temperature gas is ex- 
panding? Obviously, a rocket. 

This is why we shall have fusion 
torchships before we have fusion 
reactors lighting cities. You have to 
proceed through the stage of rocket 
development to get to power 
reactors. Nice? 

HOAGLAND: Unbelievable. 

ENZMANN: What I have 

described is only one way to build a 
successful fusion reactor. There are 
others. We at Northeast Cryonics 
have developed, hopefully, some 
interesting innovations of our own; 
such as impacting the pellet from 
one direction instead of from all 
sides. This doubles the implosion 
pressure and is extremely appli- 
cable to a fusion rocket system. We 
simply do not know if all ap- 
proaches will be successful. Today 
research into this vital area, for 
rather obvious reasons, is breaking 
out across a broad front. We have 
had a breakthrough in producing 
fusion using laser techniques. That 
is not to say that other approaches 
may not — in fact, will not— over- 
take the laser approach. Research 
by its very nature is uncertain. But 


one thing can be relied upon: what- 
ever technology we can envision to 
produce fusion rocket engines 
today will be superseded by better 
technology tomorrow. Heinlein’s 
Third Stage has successive, higher 
orders of perfectability implied by 
the fact that the first of anything 
has room for improvement, even 
the first of a third-stage device! 

Now, to address the exciting 
prospect of the when, where, and 
how of torchship construction: Let 
me begin by laying out one more 
table. I assure you it is the last. As 
you can see, tabulated below are 
“pacing items” ranked in order of 
flight-readiness as noted (or pro- 
jected, in the case of future hard- 
ware).

In addition to “when,” “where” 
is also interesting. The first torch- 
ships will be built on earth. They 
will probably be modified upper 
stages of vehicles which rightfully 
have made space history over the 
past fifteen years. The name 
“Agena” or “Centaur” may enjoy a 
brief renaissance as, rebuilt inside 
and fitted with a prototype fusion 
drive, this first torchship becomes 
an unmanned precursor to manned 
flight to every interesting chunk of 
real estate orbiting the sun. In 
every other area — guidance, com- 
puter technology, navigation, power 
systems, communications, and con- 
trol, we have learned enough across 
these last incredible fifteen years to 
take on the solar system and any- 
thing it can throw at us. All we have 
lacked was the propulsion. 


Thus, the first torchship. 
Centaur or Agena, lofted into orbit, 
in the payload bay of a space 
shuttle, turned loose, will com- 
mence to “unteach” the lessons of 
space laboriously explained to each 
of us by the Cronkites, the Magees, 
and Bergmans of the pre- Space 
Era. 

Spaceflight, up to now, has con- 
sisted of assembling a very large 
quantity of fuel and oxidizer in a 
metal tube, together with an engine 
to burn it in, and a very small pay- 
load (relatively speaking). The ob- 
ject: to burn said propellants as 
soon as possible, thus accelerating 
fuel, tank, engine and payload 
away from the earth as rapidly as 
possible. Once having released the 
payload from the final stage, you 
are in for the Long Wait. 

Since you have used most of the 
energy contained in the fuel you 
burned just to climb to the top of 
Earth’s gravitational “hill,” there 
isn’t much left to give you a healthy 
push on your way to Mars, the 
Moon, Venus or Jupiter. There you 
are, coasting along at a few thou- 
sand miles per hour, with millions 
of miles to cover. Worse, you are 
not traveling in a straight line, but 
a curving path which will add 
literally hundreds of millions of 
miles to the trip. This is the classic, 
coasting interplanetary journey 
portrayed by everyone from Asimov 
to Zelazny. 

Therefore, later — much later — 
varying from about a hundred days 
for a “quick” trip to Venus to 
almost two years to Jupiter (or six 
years to Saturn), you arrive. By 
which time most people will have 
forgotten you’re out there, except

for that dedicated gang back at 
Mission Control. 

. That is the picture of spaceflight 
held by 99.99 percent of those who 
take the trouble to think seriously 
about the subject at all. 

The days of such absurdities are 
essentially over. Alas, the 145-day 
flights to Venus and the 240-day 
missions to Mars (with its exciting 
layover of a Martian year, waiting 
for Earth to be in correct position 
for the return coasting flight) are 
not going to happen. Technology 
and time have caught up, even with 
Arthur Clarke (at least in the solar 
system). 

This is the way it will happen: A 
torchship will leave earth orbit, ac- 
celerating on a series of explosions 
produced by the events previously 
described. Fusion, with millions of 
times the energy of chemical re- 
actions, and much higher coupling 
of this energy to the exhaust, re- 
sults in a rocket engine and total 
ship performance which is nothing 
less than sensational, compared to 
the previous scenario. The ship ac- 
celerates away from Earth at (let us 
say, for the purpose of making a 
point), one “gravity” — an accelera- 
tion equivalent to that experienced 
on the surface of Earth where all 
objects fall at the same rate, 32 ft/ 
sec 2 . To those of us in the ship, 
everything will appear as it does on 
Earth, unless we look out the Win- 
dows. Something dropped in the 
cabin will apparently “fall” to the 
floor at the same rate as it would on 
Earth, although actually it is the 
floor which is accelerating up to 
meet the object. No difference. Our 
“weight,” synthetic as it is and pro- 
duced only by the thrust of * our 


fusion engine, will be just as useful 
when it comes to sitting in chairs, 
or walking, or drinking liquids as 
actual gravitational weight is on 
Earth. 

After about half an hour of this, 
we may begin to wonder if there 
isn’t something rather strange 
about the • performance of our 
vehicle. After all, we know that 
“normal” rockets such as those 
used in Apollo never burned for 
longer than about 12 minutes, and 
in that time consumed literally 
thousands of tons of fuel! This 
ship, about as massive as a jumbo 
jet (200 tons) has, according to our 
fuel gauge, consumed only 1800 
pounds of deuterium — less than a 
ton! And we are still accelerating. 

After about two hours of this 
novel experience, enjoying normal 
earth weight, carpeted lounges, the 
pleasant attentions of stewards who 
bring drinks we can consume in the 
normal manner, we walk down to 
the observation area where we see a 
magnificent panorama of space. 
Imagine the shock as we realize 
that we are halfway between Earth 
and the moon — 120,000 miles away 
from Earth and still accelerating, 
still consuming fuel. At this point 
we discover something else. The 
heavens are slowly turning around; 
the earth which was behind us is 
now in front, and the moon which 
was before us has taken up a 
position aft (to borrow a nautical 
phrase). It becomes apparent to us 
almost at once that the two celestial 
objects have not changed positions 
at all. Our 200-ton ship has rotated 
180 degrees. Our fusion “torch” 
engine, which only moments before 
was accelerating us to higher and 


90 


IF 



higher velocities, is continuing to 
thrust, but its effect is now to kill 
our enormous velocity. Inside, of 
course, nothing changes. Accelera- 
tion, deceleration, it’s all the same 
within the ship where the floor still 
presses reassuringly against our 
feet with normal Earth weight. 

Glancing at the system read-outs 
positioned so conveniently near the 
view-glass, we are incredulous at 
our measured velocity indicator. It 
must be in error! We are moving, it 
says, at 63 kilometers per second, 
relative to Earth. We remember 
Apollo, when the . Command 
Module crawled across this point at 
a mere .6 kilometers per second — 
one hundredth our velocity — not in 
two hours, but over two days! Two 
hours more and the Captain slides 
us neatly into a breathtaking orbit 
of the moon. Under its gravitation- 
al field, weightless for the first time 
during the flight (the drive is 
turned off), we take 45 minutes to 
swing around the Farside and head 
home. Earth before us once again, 
the torch is lit, normal gravity re- 
sumes, and we accelerate away 
from Luna. It has taken us less 
time to span the almost half million 
miles between these two worlds 
than it took, in 1974, to fly across 
the United States in a vehicle of 
comparable size. It has taken far 
less fuel (a total of about 15 tons of 
deuterium-tritium) than a 747 
burned flying cross-country (about 
70 tons of kerosene) and at vastly 
higher peak velocities — 227,000 
km/hr, compared to a 747’s 960 
kni/hr. We have made the trip 
totally contained in an essentially 
terrestrial environment with all the 
“comforts of home.” 


Similar journeys, to any planet in 
the solar system, under identical 
environmental conditions (simulat- 
ed Earth gravity through continu- 
ous acceleration /deceleration; con- 
ventional meals served on real 
plates; and beverages served in 
cups or glasses) will be common- 
place within 15 years. No point in 
the solar system will be further 
from any other point, at one “G” 
acceleration, than 5 weeks’ travel 
time, the length of a relaxing 
terrestrial cruise. The . ships, of 
course, will resemble ocean liners 
far more than they will terrestrial 
aircraft 

HO AGLAND: Breathtaking, lit- 
erally breathtaking. 

ENZMANN: But — as you should 
be the first to point out— it is much 
more than that. It is necessary. 
With controlled fusion and torch- 
ships, we inherit, not only the solar 
system but the stars. Without this 
discovery, we as a species would 
most certainly be confined to our 
planet. Earth. As we are now dis- 
covering, Earth is a very limited 
environment in which, if we were to 
remain, we would have to impose 
the most severe restrictions upon 
ourselves in the use of resources 
and our future evolution. Because 
of the perversity of human nature 
as evidence by history (as with phy- 
sics, every action produces a re- 
action), such restrictions would 
necessarily quite soon become dic- 
tatorial. Thus, barely two hundred 
years after its first real test, the 
fragile experiment of “freedom for 
all men” would have perished, dis- 
appearing from the future of man- 
kind forever, although probably 
not without cataclysmic, devastat-

ing, and continuing violence all 
over the globe. 

Instead, if the solar system is well 
on the way to urbanization by 1984, 
and the first unmanned precursor 
probes to the stars have been 
launched, we can dismiss the Or- 
wellian prophecies. It will be the 
beginning of the Post- industrial 
Age when spaceships, the Atomic 
Age, microelectronics, robotics, 
fusion power, and exploration of 
the stars emerge. It will be the be- 
ginning of Civilization as Man has 
never knofrn it but, in effect, has 
always dreamed it. 

Years ago, I termed this move to 
expand mankind’s ecological niche 
The Grand Design. It has begun 
with our first tentative probings of 
the solar system. It will continue 
with torchships and urbanization of 
the sun’s family, according to 
Krafft Ehricke, as Man’s Magnifi- 
cent Heritage. ■ 

Realization of its real meaning 
will come, however, whether it be 
50, 5,000, or 5 billion years beyond 
tomorrow — when the earth is

EDITORIAL 


ON BUILDING WALLS 

Sometime early in any new Editor’s term of office it is incumbent 
upon him to step out front and clearly and forthrightly state his 
editorial policies for all to see. Right? Well, I thought so — until it 
came down to actually putting it on paper, that is. Then I realized 
that for a science-fiction magazine such a statement would entail a 
definition of sf — and, Gentle Readers, I just don’t happen to have 
one of those on tap. 

I’ve seen a lot of such definitions; most of them are witty, trenchant, 
well thought out — and manage to corral about two-thirds of what I 
consider to be valid sf, leaving that other vital third (whichever third 
it may be) out in the cold. Such definitions also generally include 
within the pale one or more categories which I do not consider valid 
sf, ranging from NASA-pamphlet style fiction (“But what if our too- 
steep re-entry curve results in excessive loss of ablative material, 
Joe?’’) to paranoid-schiz dissolving-at-the-edges, rotten-to-the-core 
stream-of-consciousness type fiction. (Yes, the doorway really is a 
gaping mouth, and it really is going to eat you!) 

No, when it comes to defining our field, intensive definitions don’t 
seem to work very well. They just build walls. Unnecessary ones. 
They stifle and constrict and don’t contribute a damn thing toward 
keeping out the gunk. 

As for extensive definitions, well, they tend not to be terribly defini- 
tive, as it were, but at least they’re harmless and hopefully entertain- 
ing. So here, off the top of my head are a few of my favorite authors: 
Robert Heinlein; Cordwainer Smith; Larry Niven; Roger Zelazny; 
James Blish; Theodore Sturgeon; Isaac Asimov; Ursula K. LeGuin; 
Poul Anderson; Kurt Vonnegut, and on and on I could go — but I’d 
better not or the list would begin to grow exclusive instead of repre- 
sentative. Walls again. 

So. No walls — and just one credo; that if Man behaves with a 
modicum of rationality and good will he can prosper, on Earth, in 
his Solar System, and (unless he meets Bug Eyed Uglies even meaner 
than he is) in the farthest reaches of the Universe; and that if he does 
not so behave, he is doomed to tedium, tribulation and probable ex- 
tinction.

f j e looked up as one of the 
jj^ship’s stewardesses came to- 
ward him. He already knew why 
she had come. 

“Doctor Lisbon?” 

“Yes?” 

“The captain will see you now.” 
It was obvious from her face that 
she stood in slight awe of him. It 
was not every man whose impor- 
tance warranted pulling a stellar 
liner out of spacewarp for an emer- 
gency rendezvous. Nor were there 
many in Space who did not know 
his reputation as the ion Ex- 
plorer’. 

Sadly. Peter Lisbon replaced the 
book of poetry on the library shelf, 
and followed her. This far it had 
been a pleasant trip. Unfortunately 
it had its ending in an appointment 
with fear. He hoped that the terror 
inside him did not show. 

In the Captain’s cabin he was in- 
troduced to the senior officers of 
the liner. All were glad to shake his 
hand, although the nature of his 
mission was not mentioned. Then 
he was conducted with some cere- 
mony to the decking hatch, beyond 
which the brutally functional space 
tug waited to take him to the obser- 
vatory complex in orbit around 
Mephisto. They piped him off- 
board as though he were a hero. 
Lisbon was sickened by his own 
duplicity. He knew he was a 
coward. 

As he passed through the gaunt, 
metal airlock seals, it was more 
than the end of a journey. It was 
also a returning to a way of life he 
had hoped was dead and past. For 
twelve months now he had escaped 
such scenes as these and their after- 
math. In the interim, he suspected, 


he had lost what little nerve he had. 

The tug made no concessions to 
comfort. Safety and efficiency were 
the only criteria. He was strapped 
into a rough webbing harness, like 
a transit crate of electronic instru- 
ments, and told to stay there. The 
warning was not untimely. The 
tug’s maneuvering was a series of 
bone-breaking excursions as it 
drove itself clear of the gigantic 
bulk of the liner and began to lose 
speed as it fell toward the lower 
orbit of the space observatory. 

Although he had been in a simi- 
lar situation a hundred times be- 
fore, Lisbon had never conquered 
his dislike of the experience. The 
raw, physical contact with space, 
which was nowhere more apparent 
than in a space tug, frightened and 
humbled him. His admiration was 
unbounded for the men who spent 
most of their working lives in these 
perilous and unrewarding condi- 
tions. 

Finally one of the crewmen ap- 
proached him and saluted. 

“Doctor Lisbon — you have 

priority clearance for disembarka- 
tion. Would you please make ready 
to report to the mission controller 
in the observatory as soon as the 
airlock seals have been verified.” 

“Acknowledged!” said Lisbon, 
without enthusiasm. 

He released himself from the 
webbing cage, hating the feel of 
null-gravity. The summons had 
been unnecessary. He had already 
deduced the attainment of orbit 
around Mephisto and the coupling 
of the space tug to the observatory 
complex. Unpleasant though the 
short journey had been, he now re- 
gretted the ending of even this.

guessing something of what was to 
come. He had savoured every 
second of the orbiting procedure, 
trying to stretch the seconds out to 
gain a few more precious moments 
of heart’s ease before the great 
ordeal began. 


WT ’ arl Reinspringer, the mission 
|V?ontroller, was waiting for him 
in tne observatory. Theirs was an 
acquaintanceship of long standing 
and great mutual respect. Once a 
flamer himself. Reinspringer knew 
exactly the fears that hunted be- 
hind Lisbon’s precarious pose of 
calm. This knowledge was a bond 
unique between flamers. It was 
something which could never be ap- 
preciated fully by those who had 
not themselves passed through the 
ion barrier. 

“You got my message then, 
Peter?” Reinspringer’s relief at see- 
ing Lisbon was pathetically 
obvious. 

“Pulling a stellar liner out of 
space warp for a crash re-direction 
spells big trouble without sending 
messages. But I can’t help you, 
Karl. 1 was taken off the lists ^ year 
ago.’’ 

“There’re good flamers and ex- 
ceptional ones.” Reinspringer’s 
bald head returned a green from 
the fluorescent panels, almost as 
though his head itself was domed 
with bottle-glass. “The good ones I 
had were no match for Mephisto. 
Now I need an exceptional one to 
see if we can get them out.” 

“1 told you, Karl — I’ve been re- 
tired. Struck off.” 

“My ears heard you, but my 
brain doesn’t listen too well. I have 


two of my best people in ion-state 
on the surface. They ran into 
trouble — and I lost all four of the 
backup team trying to get them 
out. Now there’s six people down 
there, Peter, and some of them may 
still be alive. I don’t give a damn 
about your coming off the lists. I 
need you to go down there to fetch 
any survivors out.” 

“What makes you think I might 
succeed where your backup 
couldn't?” 

“Because survival in ion-space 
isn’t just a habit with you — it’s an 
instinct. That’s how you got to be 
the oldest flamer in the business.” 

"You know why they retired 
me l 

"They said you began to have 
bad entries into ion-space. Look, 
Peter, I worked with you for years. 
I know you always did have bad en- 
tries. That’s not the point. It’s the 
exits that count — the ability to 
come back.” 

“Tell me about Mephisto,” said 
Lisbon unhappily. 

* * * 


Lisbon’s first view of Mephisto 
I j was the real crusher. Through 
tne observatory’s clearports hung 
the great ball of Mephisto, crawling 
with tongues of fire. Even from 
their orbital distance it seemed to 
fill most of the available sky. It 
hung there, huge, hideous, and 
enigmatic— like a gigantic coal-fire 
hanging in space. Gazing into this 
curious cauldron it was impossible 
not to imagine that one could feel 
its heat and hear the hiss and 
shriek of the flames. This feeling 
touched some agonizing pulse in 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


97 



the primitive root- instincts of Man. 
Yet the realities of ion-space would - 
doubtless show even these fears to 
be an understatement. 

Too hot to be a planet; far too 
cool to be a star, Mephisto was a 
cosmological mystery. It had no 
place in the Hertzsprung-— Russell 
diagram. It fitted none of the ac- 
cepted classifications either for type 
or the nature of its reactions. 
Perhaps it was a throwback to a 
state of matter which existed before 
the universe began. Or perhaps it 
was an example of an evolutionary 
sequence beyond the fate of dwarf 
and neutron stars. Perhaps it was 
something as different again. 

“I know what you’re thinking, 
Peter,” said Reinspringer, coming 
up behind him. ‘‘You’re wondering 
what possessed us to put people 
down there in the first place.” 

“I’ve seen worse hells,” said Lis- 
bon. “But at least the physics of the 
reactions were well understood be- 
fore anybody went in. How come 
your team went down so unpre- 
pared?” 

“Frankly, we didn’t have the an- 
swers to give them. Mephisto’s an 
enigma. For four years we’ve sat 
and looked at it and theorized. 
Ultimately somebody had to take 
the risk of a descent, even into such 
a welter of unknowns.” 

“Who were your lead team?” 

“Andre Beriov and Loya Tre- 
main.” 

“Beriov’s a good man. First-rate 
theoretical physicist. But I’d not 
rate him as much of a flamer. As 
for Loya — I thought I’d taught her 
to know better than to take risks 
like that.” 

“She’s specialized in solar-flare 


work. Isn’t that sufficient recom- 
mendation?” 

“There’s one hell of a difference 
between running sunflares and 
mixing it with the type of ion stew 
you have on Mephisto. In stellar 
work you don’t have the problems 
of exchanging ion identities in 
order to move around. What about 
the backup team? Weren’t they 
more widely experienced?” 
Reinspringer bit his lip. “All are 
new faces from the IEC. Top 
graduates from environmental 
training, with some solar work by 
way of experience.” 

“It’s the emphasis on solar work 
which I find disturbing. Whatever 
it is, Mephisto isn’t a sun.”" 
Reinspringer was frowning 
heavily. “Are you suggesting I sent 
the wrong team?” 

“The team’s all right. It’s Me- 
phisto that’s wrong.” Lisbon swung 
his arm to encompass the great orb 
hanging in the sky. “I’ve been 
studying the interaction between 
some of those flames down there. 
Most of the reactions make sense, 
but some have a peculiar chemistry 
which isn’t even in the book.” 
“Hence our interest in Mephisto 
in the first place.” 

“Sure — but what happens if a 
~Jfomer happens to find a route 
using one of these parachemic ele- 
ments as an identity? What type of 
chemistry does he use to find his 
way out?" 

Reinspringe^ was impressed by 
Lisbon’s rapid grasp of the prob- 
lem. “It was a calculated risk. Re- 
grettably it seems we didn’t do our 
figure work too well.” 

The knot in Lisbon’s guts was 
now so tight it brought beads of 


98 


IF 



perspiration to his brow. He knew 
by instinct when a risk was unac- 
ceptable. In ion space his instinct 
had fetched him back safely more 
times than either his training or his 
experience. Had he been on the 
project from the start, he was confi- 
dent that there would not now be 
six souls down there in that ionized 
limbo. Certainly with such incom- 
plete knowledge of the environ- 
ment nothing could have persuaded 
him to make the descent himself. 

At this point, however, the de- 
cision had been taken from him. 
Regardless of the risk, if life even in 
ion form persisted on Mephisto, he 
was duty bound by the unspoken 
creed of the flamers to go down 
there and offer such assistance as 
he could. From just such a prospect 
had developed the broad bands of 
nightmare which had resulted in a 
series of bad entries and finally 
caused him to be struck off the l EC 
register. For this last act he had 
been secretly glad. The nightmares 
had continued, but without the 
menacing possibility of becoming 
real. That was until Reinspringer 
had pulled him off a liner in mid- 
warp to help with an emergency . 

* * * 

W hen he asked for three 
drums, they brought him 
three, wrapped in shining vacuum 
packs. Each drum was worth more 
than Lisbon could earn in a life- 
time. In the dust-free, sterile condi- 
tions of the preparations room he 
took the beautiful octahedral in- 
struments from their wrappings 
and examined them carefully. They 
were true and flawless. His fingers 


moved lovingly across the dia- 
phragms, testing their sensitivity. 
Through the triple glass of the con- 
trol-room windows Reinspringer 
was anxious about such handling, 
but dared not interfere. 

Finally Lisbon was satisfied and 
nodded his assent. Reinspringer 
printed out the spectral analysis of 
the gas in the ionization chamber 
which the flamer had chosen for his 
initial identity. Argon blue-green at 
five-fourteen nanometres. Lisbon 
leaned back into the black softness 
of the couch, his precious drums 
drawn up close to him. He was as 
ready to go as he ever would be. 

He was approaching the point he 
had learned to fear the most. This 
was the actual entry into the state 
of ion identity. The metamorphosis 
was relatively easy: coming to terms 
w ith it was the part that made him 
cringe. 

“How do you feel?” Reinspring- 
er’s voice was metallic over the 
speaker. 

“Sick!" said Lisbon. “What 
else’d you expect?” 

The phrase held no element of 
humor, yet everybody grinned, and 
in so doing the tension wound down 
a minute amount. Lisbon steeled 
himself. He hoped it was not ob- 
vious that he no longer believed he 
had the moral fibre to take the 
stresses without cracking. Once 
safely through the ion barrier and 
having forced himself into an ac- 
ceptance of its tenets, he knew he 
would feel better — more able to 
tackle the problems that were 
posed. In retrospect it always 
seemed a challenge. But in pros- 
pect . 

As the electrode cages dropped 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


99 



around him he asked himself for 
the millionth time why he had ever 
mad e flaming his profession. As al- 
ways, it was a useless question. His 
very first exposure to the state of 
ion identity had opened up en- 
thralling vistas so enormous in 
scope he had had no other choice. 
Once sampled, there had been no 
other way to live. 

Deeply rooted in the psyche were 
factors which had only shadowy 
analogues in the molecular world. 
Challenge, excitement, and com- 
plete involvement with the environ- 
ment were words which conveyed 
very little of the experiences of 
flamers. There were no terms to ex- 
plain the totality of the impressions 
every ion-space explorer knew so 
intimately. 

Nothing in this argument, how- 
ever, modified the fact that a 
journey into ion-space was always a 
hazardous venture. Mephisto 
promised to be the most hazardous 
of all. Even such a superbly trained 
and practiced lead-team as that 
sent down by Reinspringer had 
critically overreached itself. The 
long list of known dangers was 
enough to sit like lead in Lisbon’s 
stomach. He dared not even specu- 
late about the inevitable unknowns. 

At last the preparations were 
complete. Through the control- 
room window Reinspringer signal- 
ed the final acknowledgment. As it 
always did when the air pressure 
was reduced, the sounds in the 
room dulled curiously, leaving 
nothing but the sharp click of the 
pumps. Lisbon braced himself in 
the couch and waited for the transi- 
tion to begin. He avoided looking at 
the faces at the window. He wished 


they would not look at him. The 
first stage of trans-ionization was 
always a little like an execution. 

Fortunately the transition period 
was short. Once the field hit maxi- 
mum there w as nothing left of him 
capable of either transmitting pain 
or receiving it. In one frenzied 
picosecond he was completely de- 
stroyed and then rebuilt, transliter- 
ated bodily into a sentient, gaseous 
plasma-state by electron stripping 
and ion pairing. 

Disorientation . the trauma 
of destruction and re-creation . 
vertigo. Especially vertigo. Seconds 
before, he had been seated on the 
preparation couch. Suddenly the 
couch had gone. The observatory 
w hich bore the couch was already a 
thousand kilometers above him. 
Between him and the furnace in the 
sky was . nothing. 

ttjte was insubstantial, a plasma 
Jfl functioning in a vacuum still 
tocwiard for the focused microwave 
beam to raise even a glimmer of 
visible radiation. He was falling . 
Falling more terribly than one falls 
even in nightmare shock. Nor was 
there any pillow' he would reach 
w hen the fear peaked at the limits 
of what he could endure. 

He would just go on falling . 

Panic rose, and he fought it as he 
had done so many times before. 
Phis time he knew that he had lost 
the vital mastery. There was 
nothing left in him capable of con- 
trolling the situation. He was going 
to continue falling into the fires be- 
neath him, to become a minor con- 
taminant in this very alien furnace. 

“Snap out of it, Peter!” 

That was Reinspringer’s voice 


100 


IF 



urgent on the beam. Lisbon 
wondered if he had been screaming 
or if the controller had correctly de- 
duced what was going on in his 
mind. The latter was more prob- 
ably true. Lisbon clutched desper- 
ately at this link with normality. 
Thankfully he felt control swim 
back. 

He was through! 

“It’s all right, Karl. A bad entry 
is all.” 

“I tell you something, eh? Your 
entry was no worse than the others 
when they saw what they were 
getting into.” 

Lisbon did not answer. Beneath 
him, the challenge of the vast infer- 
no that was Mephisto was a matter 
that now commanded all his atten- 
tion. Reinspringer’s continued re- 
assurances held less meaning for 
him than the micro-traces of 
helium he w as beginning to discern 
rising out of the fringes of the 
upper atmosphere. He reached out 
to feel for his drums and found 
them comfortingly close. 

The adoption of ion-identity was 
one thing in a classical ion-training 
environment. It was quite a 
different matter to plunge through 
space to fall headlong into the com- 
plex cauldron of a body such as 
Mephisto. Lisbon had to remind 
himself that, having adopted a suit- 
able ionic state, the crushing pull of 
the planet — or was it a rogue 
sun?- was not necessarily an ines- 
capable gravitational pit. Converse- 
ly, he found it impossible to forget 
that even the theorists disagreed as 
to precisely what Mephisto was. 

He felt the nudge of the beam, 
corrected his course. In the obser- 
vatory far above him. Reinspring- 


er’s hand at the controls was a con- 
stant reminder of the need for ob- 
jectivity. Never for a moment must 
he forget he w as a creature. whose 
normal identity was molecular — the 
so-called state of mol-identity. Ion- 
identity was a transient and arti- 
ficial state. Its virtue was that plas- 
moid identities could go and ob- 
serve in conditions where no 
molecular beings could survive. Its 
drawback w as that a consciousness 
in an ionized state could easily 
confuse itself w ith the Universe. 

Soon he reached the radiation 
bands of Mephisto’s outer atmos- 
phere. It was here essential for him 
to tighten his complex to prevent 
spin-off of essential ions. For- 
tunately he knew his trade. He 
easily mastered sufficient plasma- 
cohesion to ride safely through the 
radiation bqlt without excessive 
weakening. There were other bands 
below, but most of these should not 
be so difficult or dangerous. There 
was no serious risk of being con- 
verted into uncontrollable photon 
reactions short of the Ml and M2 
layers. 

As he lode the microwave beam 
through the increasing density of 
the upper atmosphere, his capacity 
for ionization gradually became 
more apparent. Lisbon began to 
discern the first signs of the visible 
radiation which characterized the 
identity of himself and his drums. 
The intensity of the beam also 
made if possible for him to more 
easily identify some of the rarefied 
atoms which were present in the 
softening vacuum. From this point 
on he must be very much alert. He 
would need every particle of infor- 
mation he could gather if he were 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


101 



ever to regain the observatory. 

J riSBON was a conservative. Ex- 
j perience and age had taught 
ini that caution paid. He had sac- 
rificed ion-mobility in favour of the 
considerably inert characteristics of 
argon. Increasing ionization induc- 
ed a blue-green plasma, which 
though it could not rival the splen- 
dour of ionized sodium, was never- 
theless distinctive enough to permit 
his passage to be followed by the 
telescopes on the observatory. 

The certainty of the wavelengths 
of his own luminance gave him a 
reference point against which to 
estimate the spectral responses of 
other substances in which he was 
interested. In the absence of instru- 
mentation, such estimates were his 
specialty. On many occasions such 
an ability had saved his life. 

His passage through the increas- 
ing density of Mephisto’s iono- 
sphere gradually became a blaze of 
triumph. The focused microwaves 
of the observatory’s masers opened 
a broad highway of conductivity, 
setting him into a flare which was 
locally brighter than the radiation 
from Mephisto itself. For a 
moment he knew the touch of pure 
exhilaration as he burned down out 
of the sky. 

When he hit the M 1 layer, things 
took a decidedly graver turn. Rein- 
springer, who was following his 
course by spectroscope, was quick 
to issue a warning. At the wave- 
lengths the observatory’s masers 
were currently tuned to generate, 
the microwave beam was likely to 
suffer severe attenuation due to ab- 
sorption by rising gas clouds. Com- 
munication could be continued 


intermittently through to base 
level, but for ionization potential 
Lisbon would have to seek his 
energy directly from the sources 
available on Mephisto. 

This was Lisbon’s first positive 
indication that the rescue exercise 
was running into trouble. He was 
far from happy. The adoption of 
native ions and energy sources was 
a frequent but not well-advised ex- 
pedient, and certainly not one to be 
indulged in so early in the game. It 
was permissible only if the flamer 
had an intimate knowledge of the 
sequence of chemical ion reactions 
leading into and out of his alterna- 
tive identities. 

Normally such sequences were 
planned and rehearsed so that the 
(lamer was optically able to identify 
his chosen route by reference solely 
to the colour of the flames. Where 
the main keys to elemental identity 
lay beyond the range of the human 
eye, guidance was normally given 
from the broadband spectroscopes 
on the observatory. In the present 
case reliable communications from 
the space observatory were apt at 
best to be erratic. At worst, they 
were liable to be completely absent. 

While Lisbon was confident that 
he could accurately determine most 
of the elements with spectral lines 
between four hundred and seven 
hundred nanometres, there was 
ample opportunity for mistake 
without confirmation from the 
spectroscopes. The range of the 
visible spectrum was far too limited 
to give him more than partial 
guidance. 

The worst prospect was that Me- 
phisto seemed to contain com- 
pounds — even elements — unknown 


102 


IF 



on Earth. There had been tantaliz- 
ing glimpses of a whole new range 
of elements with stable nuclei be- 
yond the fabled ‘sea of instability’ 
which characterized the limits of 
natural and man-made elements. 
There was even a hint of a mirror- 
inversion of the known periodic 
table leading down an orderly para- 
chemic series with properties out- 
side all speculation. 

At the M2 layer Reinspringer’s 
fears were amply confirmed. Par- 
tial ionization of the rising gases 
gave rise to fantastic auroral 
screens spread into curious curtains 
by Mephisto’s magnetic fields. Tht 
fluctuations of these unstable layers 
caused random attenuation of the 
microwave beam. Lisbon could 
cope with curtailed communication, 
but the loss of beam power so early 
was dangerous indeed. Penetration 
of the chemosphere needed ioniza- 
tion potential sufficient to maintain 
the cohesion of the plasma which 
gave him his identity. If the beam 
failed as he hit the chemosphere he 
was liable to have his ions dissi- 
pated round the globe too thinly for 
recovery ever to be possible. 

The major barrier was the hy- 
droxyl zone. In this Lisbon revealed 
his habitual foresight in adopting 
an argon identity. Argon had no 
hydroxyl radical worth bothering 
about. He passed through the 
chemosphere riding on a tide of 
maximum beam intensity. How 
lucky he had been was immediately 
underscored by a drastic beam 
failure only seconds after he had 
made a safe penetration. From this 
point on he would be forced to 
choose his identity from the native 
ions in the lower atmosphere, and 


seek the essential ionization poten- 
tials from the energies of Mephisto 
itself. 

Freed now from the limitations 
of the beam, he was able to inhabit 
any elements which exhibited the 
suitably excited states needed to 
support the requirements of 
identity and sentience. This should 
have been a tremendous liberation 
of the spirit. On this occasion, 
however, it was also the deadliest of 
technological traps. Without a sure 
knowledge of the progressive 
chemical sequences involved, he 
could all too easily become trapped 
in the complexity of the uncharted 
ionic tides. If he did so, there might 
be no way back. 

I isbon decided to stop and take 
j stock of the situation. The 
rising flood of radiant energy lent 
him sufficient power to maintain 
his identity intact through the 
periodic failures of Reinspringer’s 
beam. The sight beneath him was 
enthralling. Gigantic plumes of 
multicoloured flames leaped from 
Mephisto’s surface and were pro- 
jected dozens of kilometers into the 
atmosphere. Beneath the plumes a 
veritable sea of multicoloured fire 
seethed and coalesced and ran with 
the interplay of strange reactions. 

When the beam power was 
strong, he relayed to Reinspringer a 
commentary describing and classi- 
fying the fantastic abysses and 
mountains of fire below. Where 
possible he added tentative identifi- 
cation of the reacting elements as 
judged from the colours of their 
ionized spectra, though he was con- 
scious of the narrowness of the 
visible window through which the 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


103 



human eye could observe. When 
the beam failed, he hung there 
considering how best to utilize his 
limited resources for a rescue at- 
tempt he was now certain must fail. 

At last he judged it was time to 
make a move. Reinspringer had re- 
corded all the useful data and there 
was nothing to be gained by waiting 
longer. Using the beam path as a 
guide, Lisbon made his way down 
toward the now-abandoned ‘camp- 
site’. This was a plateau of solid 
rock some three hundred metres in 
length by about fifty metres wide: 
The term campsite was a wry jest. 
In mol-space terms it had a temp- 
erature sufficient to bring it to 
cherry-red heat and its cracked and 
fissured ledges were periodically 
swept by great flames of, incan- 
descent hydrogen. For the flamers, 
however, it had been a useful ren- 
dezvous point and a base from 
which to establish bearings. 

“What’s the score from the sur- 
face, Peter?” Reinspringer’s voice 
w as faded and muffled by the inter- 
ference with the beam. 

"Grim!” said Lisbon. “From 
where I’m standing the flames are 
rising up like mountain ranges. 
I’ve no idea if burning is an apt de- 
scription of the process, and the 
tires certainly aren’t nuclear as we 
understand the term.” 

“Can you see down to the base of 
the tlames?” 

“No. It’s too far down, and the 
illumination’s too great at the sur- 
face. Campsite’s obviously the tip 
of some submerged mountain 
range. But some of the chasms I 
can see must be all of five kilo- 
meters deep. It gives you an unholy 
feeling.” 

104 


Vertigo overcame him. He re- 
tired from the precarious ledge on 
which he had been standing, curs- 
ing his inability to take the idea of a 
possible fall of a few kilometers 
when he had already descended 
many hundred times that distance 
in his transit from the observatory. 
He was aware of the incongruity, 
but powerless to escape its grip. 

“Still no clues to the reaction me- 
chanisms?” Reinspringer was per- 
sistent. 

“I tell you, Karl, there’s nothing 
in my physics which explains Me- 
phisto. If you want a clue on where 
to look, think about the chemical 
separation of the flames. There 
must be some mechanism at work 
which undoes the surface mixing. 
There’s a flame of pure calcium at 
least twenty kilometers high which 
has persisted since I left the obser- 
vatory. How do you explain the 
generation of a fountain of pure 
calcium ions from a mix of so many 
reactive contaminants?” 

“ Some sort of cosmic-sized mass- 
spectrometer?” Reinspringer was 
speculative. “I’ll put the theory 
boys to work on it. But what about 
my ion-beam. Can you see anything 
of them?” 

By w ay of answer, Lisbon gather- 
ed his drums. Bending low, he beat 
out a throbbing call, then stopped 
to listen. There was no response. 
Undismayed, he continued at inter- 
vals, each time stopping to listen 
for the slightest suspicion of an 
answer. Crouched like a demon on 
a red-hot rock in the midst of a 
streaming hell, his fingers made the 
drum speak in a voice which, 
though it was dwarfed by the blis- 
tering furies around him, neverthe- 

i F 



less had the potent tones of selected 
resonance. 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . 
His fingers lapsed into a regular 
single-beat call. 

No answer. 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . 
Then silence. Or was there a dis- 
tant echo whilst his fingers hesitat- 
ed above the micron-thick dia- 
phragms? 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . 

No doubt now. “Pam . 
Pam . Pam ...” Somewhere 
out in the terrible burning wilder- 
ness another drum made answer. 
“Pam . Pam . Pam . 

Amplified a millionfold by reso- 
nance, the answering drum took up 
the call. 


f £ IT ’ve got a contact,” said Lis- 
J_bon. “Distant but definite.” 
“So at least one of them’s alive!” 
Reinspringer sounded thankful for 
even this. 

"Keep the beam tuned on camp- 
site,” said Lisbon. “I may have to 
move well away, and I’ll need a 
point of reference. I doubt if you 
could follow with the beam if I 
move down into the flames. I’ll 
leave a couple of drums on camp- 
site and communicate with you 
through time.” 

"Acknowledged.” 

Leaving two drums on the rock, 
Lisbon took up the third and turn- 
ed his attention outward. His sensi- 
tive fingers rapped out a series of 
interrogatory pulses. Then he held 
the membrane near his ear and 
listened to the return. 

“Who is it?” asked the 
controller. 


“Andre Beriov. He’s on a plateau 
about two kilometers down from 
campsite. He exchanged identity 
for something he believed was four- 
thirty nanometres iron, then found 
it wasn’t. He can’t find a reactive 
chemical exchange with anything 
local, and the gas pocket he’s in is 
static. I’ll have to go down there 
and see if I can get him out.” 
“Take care, Peter,” said Rein- 
springer gravely. “We can’t afford 
to lose you too.” 

Tapping the drum in a regular 
series of beats, Lisbon recon- 
noitered round the edge of camp- 
site. His acute ears and the clever 
design of the instrument enabled 
him to distinguish the particular di- 
rection in which Andre Beriov was 
located. Here a great updraught of 
incandescent hydrogen swept up 
against the solid rock and formed a 
seemingly inpenetrable barrier. 
Gaining as much ionization poten- 
tial as he could acquire, Lisbon 
leaned carefully against the red-hot 
wind, and was surprised to find its 
velocity was so low that he could 
climb through it easily. 

Climbing in ion-space was not 
the physical task it was on mol- 
space Earth. Weight was a relative 
matter, dependent mainly on how 
tightly concentrated was the 
plasma in the energy package con- 
taining his identity. He could fall 
great distances in relative safety if 
he could keep his velocity low. The 
termination of a fall was critical, 
however, and inertial effects could 
easily exceed his ability to keep his 
identity intact. If physical or ther- 
mal forces became too great, they 
could strip the atoms out of the 
delicate energy shell and dissipate 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER

them very thoroughly throughout 
the surrounding winds. He there- 
fore proceeded with great caution, 
using tenuous handholds to sup- 
port hik nearly weightless body, al- 
most in the manner of a mol-space 
climber in the gravity of Earth. 

About two kilometers down, with 
the high fire-masses streaming 
above him like vertical walls, he 
came across Andre. In a cleft in the 
rock was trapped a pocket of violet 
flame, and clearly in the region 
stood Andre Beriov, clutching his 
precious drum and looking out- 
ward. His face was a picture of the 
faintest possible hope. His relief 
when he saw Lisbon was a wonder- 
ful thing to see. 

“Thank God you’ve come, Peter! 

1 thought I was here for eternity.’’ 
“Keep calm,” said Lisbon. “You 
got into that identity, so there has 
to be a logical route out.” 

“Believe me. I’d not still be here 
if 1 could find it.” 

“And you thought your identity 
was four-thirty nanometres iron?” 
“I staked my life on it.” 

Still in his argon identity, Lisbon 
prowled around the fringes of the. 
gas pocket and out to where the 
leaking traces of the gas mingled 
with the incandescent hydrogen. 
When he returned his face was' 
enlivened by a trace of wry amuse- 
ment. 

“Come on, Andre! You’re going 
home.” 

“You mean you’ve found a 
route?” 

“Yes. You’re not in an iron iden- 
tity at all. You were trapped by 
your own precision in spectral 
analysis. Sure you were in the four- 
thirty nanometre region — but it’s a 


calcium identity, not iron. Look at 
those red fringes. That’s calcium at 
six-eighteen nanometres. Iron has 
no useful bands nearer than green 
at five-twenty-seven. There’s hydro- 
gen outside. You can take the 
hydride route straight through to 
hydrogen, and ride the flame up to 
campsite. The beam’s focused on 
campsite, so that’s your route back 
to the observatory.” 

The simplicity of the trap which 
had nearly cost him his life appear- 
ed to stun Beriov momentarily. He 
started to protest, then followed out 
the clues which Lisbon had set be- 
fore him, and suddenly grinned 
with great relief. 

“Thanks, Peter. Now I know why 
they call you the Ion Explorer. You 
coming up too?” 

“Not yet. There’s another five of 
you down here somewhere. They 
sent the backup team in when you 
and Loya failed to show. With a bit 
of luck I may find another one or 
two in no worse a predicament than 
yourself. Have you seen anything of 
the others?” 

Beriov was concerned. “None at 
all I’m afraid. Only Loya and I 
were dovCn here at the time I be- 
came trapped.” 

Lisbon watched speculatively as 
Beriov made the hydride transition 
into the red of a six-fifty six nano- 
metre hydrogen identity and, with a 
wave of his hand, rose up through 
(lie great flame toward the surface 
and the route home. If Beriov wish- 
ed to remain in the profession it 
would take a two year refresher 
course in training environments be- 
fore he would again be assigned to 
an expedition. Lisbon’s fingers 
tapped out a message to be r e 


106 


IF 



peated for Reinspringer’s benefit, 
communicating through the drums 
he had left on campsite. 

“Beriov coming up. He could be 
the lucky one.” 


T his done, Lisbon again turned 
his attention to the task of try- 
ing to locate the other members of 
the expedition. For hours on end 
his drum notes beat out into the 
realms of fire without once receiv- 
ing a single answer in return.' 
During this time he was making his 
way slowly along the face of the 
peak, the summit of which was 
campsite. Finally he came around 
the end of the flame-drowned 
mountain and was able to survey 
new territory. 

Here again hydrogen was the pre- 
dominant environment, but bright 
flares of sodium, potassium and 
many of the rare-earth elements 
were particularly abundant. The 
preponderance of rare-earths re- 
minded Lisbon that the distribu- 
tion of elements on Mephisto was 
untypical of what was normally to 
be expected in galactic bodies. Me- 
phisto was a thing apart, and un- 
doubtedly contained a great many 
surprises. No visual evidence, how- 
ever positive, could ever be trusted 
at face value. 

On the far side of the campsite 
range Lisbon made a new contact. 

1 ! is drum messages now growing in 
urgency received an unexpected re- 
ply, w hich he hastened to confirm. 
His report to Reinspringer was 
terse. 

“Kem Radshorn believed trap- 
ped in parachemic identity. Re- 
covery prognosis doubtful.” 


The new drum beats were located 
well out from the comforting solid- 
ness of the campsite mountain. In 
order to traverse this region Lisbon 
knew that he would have to sacri- 
fice his precious argon identity and 
adopt an ion native to the region. 
He chose this course with great re- 
luctance, because of the reactivity 
of the available native ions and the 
strong possibility of becoming en- 
meshed in some irreversible chem- 
ical reaction. Denied physical sup- 
port, however, there was no other 
way. 

Finally he opted for blue 
hydrogen at four-eighty six nano- 
metres as being the safest available 
choice. The argon -hydrogen ex- 
change was not easy, there being no 
reactive interface. He had to rise 
high into the atmosphere where the 
ion density was low, and to make 
the identity exchange virtually a 
molecule at a time. Down in the 
flux below, such a maneuver would 
not have been possible. With the 
partial pressures being so high, the 
energy required to control the deli- 
cate transportation would have 
been inadequate to preserve his 
identity. 

It had been a long time since 
Lisbon had swum in and been part 
of a great hydrogen flame. In the 
training environments it had once 
been his great joy to swoop and leap 
w ith the vagaries of such a mobile 
Hare. Now' he found its very mo- 
bility an embarrassment and a 
danger. Only by careful control of 
his plasma form could he make the 
journey at all. 

About a kilometre out, there rose 
a plume of gaseous ions whose sin- 
gular beauty was remarkable. Blue, 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


107 



green and orange ion components 
twisted together in a flame whose 
magnificence outshone by far the 
relative transparency of hydrogen. 
It was from this column that tfie 
drum beats came. Immediately he 
came close, Lisbon realized that 
much was wrong. Whilst his optical 
range covered only a limited part of 
the spectrum, intuition told him 
that no such element should have 
existed. This was a chemical out- 
side the range of human physical 
knowledge. 

Swimming in the sea of in- 
candescent hydrogen, Lisbon made 
a wide arc around this singular 
plume, examining it from all sides. 
He could find dilution, but no in- 
teraction with hydrogen, nor could 
he tell much about the three ion- 
streams that intermingled. He tried 
to contact Reinspringer for a spec- 
troanalysis of the region, but 
doubtless hit a period of beam 
blackout, because the controller 
did not reply, and it was probable 
the message had not got through. 

Doubtfully, Lisbon began a 
spiral descent around the plume 
looking for signs of the flamer 
whose drum beats assured him was 
trapped within its fiery limbs. He 
had to drop down nearly a kilo- 
meter before he found him. 

K em radshorn, one of the 
backup team, was one of the 
new breed of flamers just emerging 
from I EC training. His introduc- 
tion to ion space would have been 
lengthy and scientific, and drawn 
heavily upon the experience of the 
older flamers such as Lisbon him- 
self. Lisbon marked it much to the 
youngster’s credit that he had not 

108 


panicked and thus risked dissipa- 
tion, but had concentrated on 
maintaining his energy shell intact 
as he tried to find a route through 
the intractable chemistry which 
bound him into his present 
position. 

Radshorn looked at Lisbon from 
his fiery prison with patent disbe- 
lief. Unlike Beriov and Loya, who 
had worked with Lisbon in the 
past, Lisbon was merely a name in 
a textbook to the younger flamer. 
Radshorn knew that help from his 
own team was barely to be hoped 
for — help from a complete stranger 
in ion space scarcely stopped short 
of a miracle. 

Drawing the drum close to him, 
Lisbon spoke. 

“How’d you get into that 
identity?” 

Radshorn pointed downward. 
“At the base. I heard Loya’s drum 
and went after her. I thought I was 
going into multi-spectral mercury, 
but it can’t be anything of the 
sort.” 

“There was a route in. There 
has to be a route out.” 

“There was a sodium flare at the 
time. I think Loya was below some- 
where and disturbed something. I 
went clean through sodium identity 
into this; then the flare died and I 
couldn’t get out again. I’ve been 
unable to find a reactive interface 
since.” 

“I’m going down to investigate,” 
said Lisbon. “If Loya disturbed 
sodium, perhaps I can do the same. 
If you see the opportunity, take it. 
Don’t wait for me.” 

“Check! Who are you, anyway?” 

“Peter Lisbon.” The flamer did 
not wait to explain further. From 

IF 



somewhere deep below him he had 
heard the beat of a druni. 

“Pam ...” 

It was only a single beat and 
might have been accidental. If 
there was a drum there, however, 
there should be another flamer not 
too far distant. Possibly Loya . 

“ Pam . .” 

If he judged the sound aright, 
the drum was knocking on 
something solid rather than being 
struck by a hand. He answered 
rapidly but received no reply. 

He dived deeply but cautiously, 
not knowing how far he could safely 
fall before he struck the bottom. In 
this matter he was wise, because he 
had less than two hundred meters 
to go before he came down into the 
skeletal forest. 

T he sight was so arresting and 
unexpected that Lisbon had to 
stop and take Stock. He was in a 
valley at the foot of two vast moun- 
tain ranges, one of which was 
campsite. The atmosphere was 
mainly incandescent hydrogen, but 
populating the valley appeared ta 
be a forest of skeletal, sponge-like 
trees whose ashen-white surfaces 
faintly glowed with every colour the 
spectrum could devise. His > first 
thought was that these were rock- 
faults laid bare by the removal of 
the surrounding material by the - 
streaming hydrogen. The regularity 
of their shapes, however, prompted 
him to look for another explana- 
tion. The singular thought which 
occurred to him was that these were 
living, replicating plants. 

The notion of indigenous life, 
under these conditions worried 
him. He began to think of duplica- 


tion in the sense of growing crystals 
rather than replication as with liv- 
ing organisms; and finally to 
wonder if there was a fundamental 
difference in systems in which a 
seed could define the characteristics 
of that which grew from it. The 
divisions between life and non-life 
were thin indeed. 

Brushing a piece of skeletal 
sponge from a tree as he passed, he 
was rewarded with a surprise flare 
of blue four-sixty three nanometres 
neodymium, which burst from the 
tree where the inert ashen surface 
was broken. Intrigued, he tried 
another tree and -got the green of 
five hundred and twenty nano- 
metres cerium. He began to suspect 
that these individual plants were 
feeding on the microtrace contami- 
nants in the hydrogen wind, and 
that they were capable of selective 
absorption of the ions which they 
adopted as their specialty. 

This factor came as no great sur- 
prise to him. Plants and bacteria on 
Earth were capable of fixing atmos- 
pheric nitrogen, and many 
species — including Man-fixed car- 
bon, calcium and many other ele- 
ments from the environment. Ion- 
exchange resins, too, had an order 
of preference in what they selected 
from their environment. The divi- 
sions between life and non-life were 
hair tine and very subjective. 

So far there was no sign of the 
drum he had heard below him. The 
flame in which Radshorn was 
locked appeared to have its origin 
in a rocky cleft near the edge of the 
campsite range. He used this blow- 
hole as the center for his investiga- 
tions, and moved around it through 
the skeletal forest looking for evi-

dence that another flamer had been 
there. 

Shortly he found a clue. From 
each of the trees which he passed, a 
small piece had been broken. Even 
now the fractures were still giving 
off a characteristic flare — lithium 
red, europium blue, cerium green, 
and a magnificent violet holmium. 
He was not sure if the trail markers 
were deliberate or whether they had 
resulted from pure curiosity on the 
part of a flamer who had passed 
this way before him, but signalling 
as they did with such a magnificent 
display of coloured fire, he had no 
difficulty in following the direction. 

On the slope of the hillside 
opposite campsite the nature of the 
vegetation changed considerably. 
Here the sponges were much larger 
and formed misshapen islands like 
vast skeleton apple-dumplings. The 
nature of their ion preference was 
altered too. The first had a fracture 
which flamed tongues of calcium, 
violet and red. Slightly up the slope 
the beautiful purple of potassium 
issued from a broad scrape along 
one side of the plant. The ap- 
parently deliberate nature of the 
damage and the position of the ele- 
ment in the periodic table caused 
Lisbon to pause and think. He 
knew suddenly what he was looking 
for — a sodium tree. 

When he found it, it was not so 
much a tree as a plantation. A 
whole area of the incandescent rock 
face was covered with the white 
skeletons of isolated sponges, and 
one of these had been almost com- 
pletely crushed. Significantly, mov- 
ing slightly on the hydrogen wind, 
was an octahedral drum. Experi- 
mentally Lisbon kicked a fragment 


of the sponge, and obtained a mag- 
nificent sodium flare. Then he took 
up his own drum and addressed the 
flamer caught in the fire-plume 
above. 

“Kem — are you in contact?” 

“Listening.” 

“Can you set your direction from 
my drumbeat?” 

“Affirmative.” 

“I’ve located a source of sodium. 
I think I can drive it into a flare. 
You got in there through a sodium 
route, so there must be a reactive 
interface with sodium. Ready to 
try?” 

“Affirmative. Will the flare be in 
the same place?” 

“Within a few metres.” 

"Give me a minute to get into 
position. I’ll tell you when I’m 
ready. Any ideas on what route to 
go for?” 

“If you can find enough oxygen, 
the hydroxyl route is safer. Other- 
,/wise go through sodium hydride. 
But whatever you do, try and make 
it right through to a hydrogen 
identity.” 

“Check! I’m ready now.” 

Looking at the crushed sodium 
tree. Lisbon decided there was not 
enough undamaged material left to 
guarantee a substantial flare. 
Alongside, however, was an even 
larger sponge which an exploring 
foot told him contained sodium. 
This seemed to promise even better 
results, and fortunately lay even 
closer to the plume which con- 
tained Kem Radshorn. Thus there 
was little danger of the flare being 
out of Radshorn’s reach. As soon as 
he could see the trapped flamer in 
the green and orange of the plume, 
he strode into the middle of the

sodium tree and began to destroy it 
with his feet. 

This was an action more easily 
imagined than performed. The low 
density of his ionized plasma iden- 
tity scarcely gave him enough 
weight to break the ashy sponge 
fragments, fragile though they 
were. Somehow he managed to 
mash sufficient of it to provide 
a wide and high flare of sodium 
ions, which swooped in a living 
yellow fire around him and licked 
hungrily at the base of the uniden- 
tified plume. Such were the radiant 
contrasts that he was unable to see 
the progress of his rescue opera- 
tion. His relief was great when a 
few moments later Kem Radshorn, 
now in an orthodox hydrogen iden-„ 
tity, swam down beside him. 

“It worked! It worked!” Rad- 
shorn’s relief was ecstatic. “I owe 
you a great deal for this, Peter.” 
“Forget it!“ said Lisbon. “You 
can best pay me back by not getting 
into trouble on your next tour. 
Right now I want you to go up to 
campsite and get off-planet before 
you get locked into something 
else.” 

Radshorn’s face fell. “With re- 
spect, I could be more use helping 
you to look for the others." 

“No. You’d be a liability. Your 
training’s too scientific, and there’s 
too many unknowns here. The only 
way to tackle Mephisto is to re- 
spond to the agony in your guts. 
And they can’t teach you that in a 
training environment.” 

“Sure!” Radshorn took the 
critical point without complaint. “I 
guess we’ve all got a lot to learn.” 
He saluted reluctantly, and be- 
gan to swim upwards through the

great hydrogen flames, keeping 
well clear of the unknown plume 
which had been his fiery prison. 
Lisbon watched him go, and 
tapped out a message on his drum 
for Reinspringer’s benefit. 

“Radshorn on his way up. Some 
theories on ion separation begin- 
ning to emerge.” 

Almost immediately the drum 
began to throb with a message from 
the controller. 

“Great work, Peter! Andre 
Beriov recovered two more of the 
backup team in disorientation- 
shock near campsite. Only Loya 
and backup man Ray Lockett still 
on Mephisto.” 

tvisorientation shock! The 
I Jnews grimly amused Lisbon. 
Disorientation shock used to be fre- 
quently suffered by novices when 
presented with mixed ion-streams 
in a training environment. At one 
time it was an accepted hazard of 
learning to handle ion identity. 
Latterly, however, training environ- 
ments had become more sophisti- 
cated* and humane, and disorienta- 
tion shock in training was now a 
rare occurrence. In Lisbon’s view, 
every flamer who was going to do a 
useful job in natural ion environ- 
ments would one day enter a situa- 
tion where multiple-choice dis- 
orientation would overload his 
senses. Far better to become accus- 
tomed to this in the relative safety 
of a training environment than in 
such a potentially deadly and un- 
charted sea of ions as the surface of 
Mephisto. The notion, however, 
gave him a new line of approach. 

In disorientation shock, the 
flamer was unable to respond to a 


drum call. For this reason he could 
not be located by standard emer- 
gency procedures. The most likely 
place to find a disorientated back- 
up man was in the hydrogen flare 
around campsite. Significantly, 
this was where Beriov had already 
located two of them. By the exercise 
of an old drum trick, Lisbon hoped 
he might locate the one still 
missing. 

He allowed the great hydrogen 
flare to lift him towards the sur- 
face, carefully reducing his plasma 
density to give himself just the right 
and safe rate of climb. He surfaced 
in a huge belt of flame that sub- 
sided rapidly. Once he would have 
been overjoyed to be in a flame 
tongue leaping free through the at- 
mosphere. Now he found the ex- 
perience a danger and an irritation, 
if human beings had been meant to 
live like flames, he thought, then the 
Maker would have seen them born 
in ion-identity. The deliberate as- 
sumption of the ion-state was part 
of the great impertinence of Man, 
who thought he could ape the gods. 
The trouble was that Man was still 
pathetically unaware of how much 
he did not know about the universe. 

U sing campsite as a center for 
his activities, Lisbon rode the 
huge plumes out to about three 
kilometers distance. From here he 
began to move in a vast circle which 
had campsite as its center. All the 
while he held his drum at his ear 
and tapped a solemn beat with his 
linger. 

" Pam . Pam . Pam ...” 
The spare drum on campsite re- 
turned the beat loud and clearly. 
“Pam . Pam . Pam . .” 


112 


IF 



In this manner he continued to 
traverse the circle, using the great 
flame slopes to conserve as much as 
possible of his energy. When he 
had covered nearly half the 
distance around the perimeter he 
heard something for which he had 
been listening. A drum between 
himself and campsite was splitting 
the beat and thereby betraying its 
direction. 

lk Pam-am . Pam-am. Pam- 
am ...” 

Methodically he set up a zig-zag 
search pattern, working his way to- 
ward campsite. A kilometer in from 
the perimeter he found the drum. 
Less than fifty meters away he 
found the missing backup flamer. 
He, too, was in a state of disorien- 
tation shock. Fortunately his nitro- 
gen identity energy shell had re- 
mained intact. Using his drum to 
communicate with Reinspringer, 
Lisbon directed that the microwave 
beam be re-sited on his present 
position. 

The movement of the beam was 
accomplished with alacrity. Soon 
the broad shaft of energy opened 
up a magnificent luminant highway 
into the sky. With the backup 
flamer still unconscious, Lisbon 
knew he would have to shepherd 
the identity package at least as high 
as the ionosphere before it could be 
safely entrusted to the beam for re- 
tention until it could later be 
collected. 

He took this decision with great 
reluctance. He knew that once he 
had negotiated the various bands 
and layers of the upper atmosphere 
he would be very reluctant himself 
to make a return. Nevertheless, 
Loya’s drum lay down there in the 


skeletal forest at the bottom of the 
hydrogen sea. If Loya’s drum was 
there, the chances were that she 
herself was not far distant. One 
thing he could not do was abandon 
an experienced flamer like Loya 
while any faintest hope for her 
recovery remained. 

“Karl — I’ve got Ray Lockett 
here. Unconscious like the others. 
I'll have to clear him through to the 
ionosphere, but I don’t want to 
come right back to the observatory. 

1 must have one more look for 

1 *1 

oya. 

Attenuation caused the beam to 
wane for a period, and Rein- 
springer wisely held his reply until 
the full beam strength had been 
restored. 

“I take your point, Peter. Rad- 
shorn’s in good shape and demand- 
ing to be allowed to help. I’ll send 
him down to meet you, and he can 
fetch Lockett up.” 

“Good thinking! And start pre- 
paring a blast for the 1EC training 
executive. Three out of four backup 
men falling in disorientation shock 
is little short of criminal. Theory’s 
not enough. It’s the human animal 
which has to be conditioned to take 
the stresses.” 

“I’m going farther than that. I’m 
demanding a full-scale disaster en- 
quiry. Those desk-bound theorists 
at home have no idea what some of 
these deep-space working condi- 
tions are like. It’s about time some- 
body jerked the rug out from under 
them.” 

Mollified, Lisbon began to sur- 
vey the problems of the ascent. 
Since he was unconscious, there 
was no way that Lockett’s identity 
could be exchanged for a less 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


113 



hazardous one such as an inert gas. 
Nitrogen would be adequate only if 
the beam power remained strong 
enough to maintain the identity 
whole in the face of the high temp- 
eratures and low pressures encoun- 
tered in the upper layers. Lisbon’s 
own hydrogen identity was also a 
risk factor. The hydroxyl zone was 
their major hazard. If the beam 
should fail at the wrong time the re- 
sults could be complete dissipation. 
Nevertheless, there was no alterna- 
tive. 

ittihey were lucky. By some trick 
1 of circumstance the periodic 
uulures of the beam coincided al- 
most exactly with their progress 
through the less critical regions. 
Through all the major bands the 
beam held strong and true. In less 
than twenty minutes they reached 
an altitude free from most of the 
planet-dependent effects. Lisbon 
was able to halt and wait the arrival 
of Radshorn from the observatory. 

In the low Uonization of this 
rarefied stratum, Radshorn was al- 
most invisible. What could be seen 
was a broad grin of welcome on his 
face, and a look of genuine concern 
when he took charge of the uncon- 
scious backup man. Lisbon was 
pleased to note the youngster had 
opted for an argon identity. The lad 
was obviously eager to learn such 
points of technique, and this was 
one trick he had been quick to 
adopt. Suddenly Lisbon did not feel 
so bad about the future of flaming. 

Having been relieved of his 
charge, Lisbon once again turned 
to make a descent to Mephisto’s 
surface. This time he was less than 
fortunate. His hydrogen identity 


was badly adapted for survival in 
the face of such unreliable beam 
energy. More than once he was 
saved from total dissipation by the 
mere vagaries of chance. Profound- 
ly dissatisfied with his perform- 
ance, he broke from the beam path 
at the earliest opportunity and 
leaned hungrily toward the welcome 
energy reserves of Mephisto’s 
bounteous fires. 

His critical situation negated his 
natural caution. When he could 
find the energy he used it — build- 
ing up a strong red hydrogen 
plasma. with a reckless disregard 
for wastage as he burned down 
toward campsite. On the beam he 
heard Reinspringer whistle. No fur- 
ther comment was necessary. They 
both knew that Lisbon’s progress 
was untypical and prompted by 
stronger motives than those of a 
mere rescue in ion-space. 

At campsite, Lisbon knelt again 
with his drums. 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . .” 

He was calling uselessly against 
the faint hope that there might be 
some return. 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . .” 

No answer whatever. No reason 
to suppose there would be. He took 
up the drum and went to the edge 
of the campsite, looking down 
toward the direction of the skeletal 
forest where he had found Loya’s 
drum. 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . .” 
If ever a note of concerned enquiry 
could be conveyed by a finger beat- 
ing on a drum, this time was now. 
He raised the instrument to his eat 
and listened, not expecting to hear 
anything and being surprised by a 
single answering beat. 


114 


IF 



‘Tam . 

It was impossible, yet he had 
heard it. Perhaps Loya’s drum was 
again moving in the hydrogen 
wind, tapping itself against some- 
thing solid. Perhaps . 

ttisbon knew he had no choice of 
1 i action. He had to go down 
into the abyss again, down to the 
skeletal forest, to search with all 
the cunning and skill and imagina- 
tion that only years of flaming 
could bestow. In such an infinite 
sea his chances of finding Loya 
were slight, especially as she was 
now without her drum. He felt 
compelled, however, to find out 
what had happened to her, and 
why. Flamers such as Loya were not 
to be lost without good cause. 

The plume which had trapped 
Radshorn was still burning brightly. 
The sodium flare which had been 
released at its edge had now burned 
out. Taking a broad, spiral course 
around the plume, he dived ever 
more deeply down through the 
hydrogen flame and stopped only 
when the white crisp bones of the 
skeletal forest appeared beneath 
him. 

The two crushed trees remained 
as a mute reminder of the previous 
passage of men. There was some- 
thing of a reproach in the way these 
two broken organisms had ac- 
cepted their lot and were already 
attempting to repair the damage. 
The speed with which the brittle 
tracery was being renewed made 
him pause in wonder — in a few 
days the wounds would all be 
healed. If all the sodium was being 
extracted from the traces in the 
hydrogen wind, then he had mis- 


judged both the concentration of 
atmospheric sodium and the capac- 
ity of the adsorption process to re- 
create the massive form of the ele- 
ment in the presence of such a 
hostile environment. 

Apart from the drum, there were 
no clues as to what had happened 
to Loya. The damage to the trees 
stopped at the point where the first 
.sodium bush had been destroyed. 
In the vain hope that he might have 
been reading the trail in the wrong 
direction, Lisbon retraced his path 
to the point where he had first de- 
scended, and then began to explore 
the terrain beyond. 

This path took him over a ridge 
and to a point where the valley floor 
dropped away into a broad ravine. 
The skeletal forest had itself been a 
place of wonder, but this new gorge 
was a place of sheer enchantment. 
From wall to rocky wall, every 
available surface was covered with 
skeletal flowers, but flowers of such 
vast dimensions and beautiful pro- 
portions and ethereal radiance that 
Lisbon could have imagined no 
more beautiful a place. Here, 
drowned under a sea of incandes- 
cent hydrogen, was the proof that 
life could prosper and survive 
under conditions which were way 
beyond anything he had previously 
conceived as credible. 

There was no doubt in his mind 
that these life-forms were ‘organic’* 
but now his conception of organic 
extended beyond its Earthbound 
connotation of being related to 
carbon chemistry. Here was a more 
versatile life-form, beautifully 
adapted tb the conditions under 
which it had evolved. Exactly what 
gave the plants their selective 


115 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 



capacity to adsorb only ions of a 
single element, he did not know. 
He suspected it was somehow asso- 
ciated with their inert ashen skins. 
If he read the signs aright, the 
individual plants probably had the 
capacity to select even single iso- 
topes of a particular element, lead- 
ing to purities of concentrated iso- 
topes on a scale undreampt of on 
Earth. 

Under such conditions of con- 
tinually alternating flux and refine- 
ment, it was no wonder to him that 
Mephisto had its own brands of 
chemistry. The insistent pressures 
of life-forms vying for a niche in the 
ecology could lead to bizarre modes 
of specialization. Constant re-flux 
and refinement of the elements 
gave ample scope to the chance 
concentration of the one atom in a 
hundred million which fell into a 
class beyond the naive constraints 
of the periodic table. Mephisto per- 
formed more chemical reactions in 
a second than Man could achieve in 
a thousand years. 

If Loya had passed this way, she 
had left no signs in this unearthly 
grotto. Unlike the trail in the skele- 
tal forest, here no luminous 
markers had been left for him to 
follow. It was, of course, possible 
that she had swum up into the 
hydrogen winds to examine the 
scene from above. To investigate 
this possibility, Lisbon swam up to 
just beyond the ceiling of the ‘vege- 
tation’, intrigued by its variety but 
learning nothing of the fate or 
whereabouts of the missing flamer. 

The notion of variety began to 
worry him. Somewhere below or in 
the new forests he was beginning to 
discern on the distant slopes, was 


one or a group of plants capable of 
selective adsorption of virtually any 
element a flamer could use as an 
identity. The only probable excep- 
tion was the hydrogen carrier itself. 
There was no doubting the capacity 
of the plants to force the selected 
element out of reluctant com- 
pounds. What if they had the 
capacity also to draw the selected 
ions out of an ion identity? 

Cursing himself for not having 
thought of the point before, he 
seized his drum and sent an urgent 
message to Reinspringer. 

“Must know Loya’s last ion iden- 
tity.” 

Reinspringer’s attention was 
prompt. “Query acknowledged. 
Checking now.” 

Lisbon however was already mov- 
ing back- along the gorge, his ex- 
pression grave. He had guessed 
what the answer must be. Loya’s 
favorite identity was the classic 
D-line resonance of sodium. It was 
her great joy to burn down out of 
the heavens glowing like a glorious 
sunlit beacon. Such was the 
definition of the sodium plasma 
that even the strands of her hair 
would become visible as she de- 
scended like a golden goddess. He 
had always 1 suspected that she 
chose sodium not so much for its 
ionic properties as for the marvel- 
lous luminance it gave to the 
identity. And Loya had tangled 
with a sodium tree . 

Reinspringer’s voice came back 
abruptly. 

“Loya went down in the five- 
eighty nine nanometre sodium 
doublet. Andre was the last to see 
her, and she was still in sodium 
then.” 


116 


IF 



“That’s what I figured,” said 
Lisbon. “If she remained in sodium 
I can’t hold out much hope.” 
“Copied for the record. Take 
care of yourself, Peter.” 

I ’isbon was nearly halfway back 
j up the gorge when he met a 
circumstance which made Rein- 
springer’s concern seem less than a 
platitude. Without any sort of 
warning, a mighty surge current of 
superheated hydrogen rammed him 
from below. The velocity of the 
blast was such that he was turned 
and tossed like paper in the wind, 
and had to fight to preserve intact 
the precious energy shell that con- 
tained his identity. 

Worse was to come. After the 
hydrogen shock wave came a 
massive yellowed-green flame which 
he instantly identified as five-forty 
eight nanometres boron. In the face 
of such intense ion pressures, he 
fought and nearly lost the battle to 
remain in hydrogen. Such an all- 
embracing concentration was ex- 
ceptional in any sort of work, and 
suggested that some highly unusual 
event had taken place below. A 
short while previously he had 
passed above the quiet and beau- 
tiful flower-fields in the gorge and, 
once he had regained his equili- 
brium, he was immediately 
prompted to dive to the source 
point to see if he could find the rea- 
son for this critical ion storm. 

This was a decision which nearly 
cost him his life. As he plunged 
down on the fringes of the boron 
flame he was engulfed in a second 
flare, this time of oxygen, which 
ran from red to purple iand reacted 
explosively with the hydrogen in 


which he swam. Fortunately he was 
slightly outside the main reaction 
sphere, but the force was sufficient 
to give him slight concussion and 
left him drifting momentarily help- 
less toward the valley floor. 

His touchdown on solid rock 
helped to bring him to his senses. 
Looking around, he was amazed to 
see that a large area of what had 
previously been flower- populated 
slopes had been utterly devastated 
by some vast reaction. Unnerved at 
first, he was almost afraid to 
theorize, let alone explore. Wide 
tracts formerly occupied by flowers 
had been stripped bare, and only 
the white, inert ash still settling on 
the rocks gave evidence that the 
plants had ever existed. The con- 
centrated elements of which the 
‘vegetation’ had been composed 
had been released in the explosive 
flare which had destroyed them. 

The incident told him much 
about Mephisto. The life-style of 
the plants was fascinating enough. 
The death-style was traumatic. At 
some point in their development, 
conditions would become such that 
the reaction of their concentrated 
elements with the atmosphere or 
their neighbors would be unavoid- 
able. Catastrophic destruction was 
the result, probably with a similar 
effect on unlike vegetation in the 
immediately^ surrounding area. 
Thus was born the bright ionic 
flames which characterized the sur- 
face of Mephisto and created the 
enigma. 

Now he had seen the death throes 
of a few of Mephisto’s fantastic 
plants. He would have liked to have 
remained to see what mysterious 
seed began the renewal. Some pri- 


MEPHISTO AND THE ION EXPLORER 


117 



mary catalyst presumably in the 
cast-off ash would trigger the birth 
of a new plant generation. These 
would grow to fruition straining the 
hydrogen winds for the precious 
elements which that seed alone was 
programmed to receive. Here was 
Nature no more nor less marvelous 
or mysterious than that on his 
native Earth, but it was an object 
lesson in understanding the uni- 
verse — Man’s comprehension of 
what constituted life was sketchy 
indeed. 

“You all right, Peter?’’ Rein- 
springer’s Voice was relayed by the 
drum. “We saw some big new 
flares in your direction.’’ 

“I was lucky,’’ said Lisbon. 
“Some of the local vegetation blew 
its top. I’ll be making a report on it 
later. But I think I know what 
makes Mephisto tick.” 

“Still no sign of Loya?” 

“I’m just going back to where I 
found her drum. I’ve a theory 
about what might have happened 
to her. I’ll try to check it out.” 

As he passed on through the 
gorge he found that about a third of 
the vegetation had been destroyed 
in the blow-up. He could only 
speculate as to what chemical re- 
action had started it, but it was ob- 
vious the occurrence was not un- 
usual. This was merely part of the 
natural life-cycle. Beyond the 
gorge, back in the skeletal forest, 
things remained unchanged. Re- 
sponsive only to traces of their own 
chosen elements, the mighty 
sponge trees were unmoved by the 
events which had taken place over 
the ridge. Indeed, the two broken 
sodium trees were making good 
progress with their repairs. 


Lisbon took up Loya’s drum and 
threw it into the middle of the first 
tree which had been broken. It 
landed on a slightly convex surface 
and moved slightly in the hydrogen 
wind. 

“Pam . ...” 

Then he took up his own drum 
and sent out one last desperate 
appeal. 

“Pam . Pam . Pam . .” 

He received but a single drum 
pulse in return. 

Leaving Loya’s drum where it 
had fallen in the tree, he turned 
sadly and made his way up through 
the hydrogen sea toward campsite. 
There was nothing else that he 
could do. Either Loya had been ad- 
sorbed by the tree or else had been 
dissipated as the flare which had 
trapped Radshorn. Whichever was 
the case, her identity was beyond 
recovery. On campsite he took the 
spare drum with his own, but left 
the third one in a cleft where it 
would not be washed away by the 
tongues of hydrogen flame. He 
knew this action was slightly irra- 
tional, but Reinspringer had once 
been a flamer himself and would 
understand the motive. 

“Mission abandoned,” he signal- 
ed the controller. “There’s nothing 
else to be achieved down here.” 

“Understood,” said Reinspringer 
on the beam. “Take it gently 
through the chemosphere. There’s 
a big atmospheric ion storm up 
high.” 

Lisbon waited until the beam 
power hit maximum then began his 
journey up the highway in the sky, 
back to his return to mol-identity. 
As he climbed high above the 
mighty fires of Mephisto he looked 


116 


IF 



back and was suddenly no longer 
afraid. In retrospect it had been 
one more challenge in a long and 
remarkable career. 

* * * 

oya?” asked Reinspringer. 

.4 j He already knew what the 
answer must be, but needed to hear 
it said. 

“She’s gone. No hope at all.’’ 

The controller met Lisbon’s eyes 
gravely, then turned back to his re- 
ports. As he made the entry in the 
log his hands were shaking. This 
was the only outward sign of ten- 
sion, otherwise Reinspringer’s ac- 
ceptance of the fiction raised no 
hint of question. Nevertheless he 
shared the doubts that haunted the 
reaches of Lisbon’s mind. The con- 
troller reached for the clip of death 
certificates and began to make out 
the fateful document. Halfway 
through, his shaking fingers 
dropped the writing stylus, and he 
looked at his hands accusingly. 

Lisbon walked away. There was 
nothing he could do to help Rein- 
springer. In any case he had his 
own spectres with , which to con- 
tend. Death in ion-space was an 
artiface designed to placate the 
public. It did not actually happen. 
In ion-state, the only end was dilu- 
tion — the dispersion of the identity- 
ions throughout such a volume of 
diluents that they became too thinly 
spread for reconstitution ever to be 
possible. The flamer became 
literally part of the restless atmos- 
phere which circled whichever alien 
sun or planet they had attempted to 
explore. 

But what of the sentience? Did 


the luckless ones ever truly die? 
Convention insisted that death cer- 
tificates be issued as soon as re- 
covery was no longer possible. 
Theorists postulated that sentience 
faded in proportion to the degree of 
dilution. With more experience of 
ion -space than any person living, 
Lisbon was not too sure. 

Sometimes when he was on a 
rescue mission, crouched on some 
alien campsite, drums beneath his 
hands, he was certain that he could 
detect the voices of flamers who 
had been diluted long before. Oc- 
casionally other fingers danced a 
hesitating rhythm, alien fingers, 
pioneers from other races and other 
times trapped in the same dissolute 
eternity. In the restless dance of 
flames, in the anguished howl of 
hurricanes, or in the serenity of 
great skies, Lisbon could detect 
them still. 

And for Loya the ordeal would 
have an even more fateful twist. 
Like a phoenix ever renewed by 
fire, her sodium identity would be 
extracted and concentrated by the 
trees of the skeletal forest. Then in 
the fury of an alien storm, her ions 
would be released to begin anew the 
fantastic dance with the flames of a 
planet which was not a planet. The 
cycle endlessly repeated. It was for 
this reason he had left her drum by 
the sodium tree and another one on 
campsite. Somewhere down on 
Mephisto he was certain Loya still 
lived, hopelessly dissipated but sen- 
tient. Or had it merely been the 
wind which rolled her drum against 
the tree? 

It was considerations such as this 
which caused him to have bad 
entries .

Sancho Jones Chu was an exceedingly 
ordinary mortal, but his destiny was 
something else again! 


ARSEN DARNAY 


Y ou can look at this matter 
from a number of perspec- 
tives. 

From one point of view it all 
began when an occasional sailor, 
soldier, handyman, and bum of 
obscure origins and indeterminate 
race, by name Sancho Jones Chu, 
on an impulse (he was very impul- 
sive) decided to consult a gypsy. 

The year was 1998 and the place 
was Houston. 

The day before the LNG Tanker 
Binivu, flying a Liberian flag, had 
docked in the harbor to take on a 
cargo of liquefied natural gas 
(LNG), preparatory to a trans- 
pacific voyage to Tokyo. LNG had 
come of age since the 1960’s, and 
Binivu was one of three hundred 
ships that moved frozen, cryogenic 
gold over the main. 

Soon after the tanker docked, it 
discharged part of its crew on shore 
leave, including Sancho Jones Chu, 
and Chu departed to partake of 
the questionable pleasures of Hous- 
ton, which left him, by the follow- 
ing morning, a little groggy and 
red -eyed and depressed, momen- 


tarily wondering what it was all 
about. 

And in that moment, most seren- 
dipitously, his eye fell on a clumsily 
painted sign. It showed the open 
palm of a hand — white against a 
red background — and below the 
palm black letters told him (he had 
to puzzle them out laboriously, 
being of limited education) that 
Madam Sna stood ready with a psy- 
chic reading for a mere $8.50 or, 
say, the equivalent of a one-egg 
breakfast with toast and coffee. 

He had no stomach for breakfast 
anyway, had never had his fortune 
told, had nothing else to do, and so 
after a moment’s examination of 
his own palm (to see if maybe he 
could do the job unaided) he went 
through the door releasing a clang- 
ing bell as he did so. 

He emerged again an hour later, 
twenty dollars lighter, but walking 
on air. He was not exactly a 
changed man; his eyes were still red 
and his breath still sour; if anything 
the black stubble on his face was a 
little longer; but there was now a 
new gleam in his eye, a bounce to 


121 



his walk. He pushed his knit cap to 
a more rakish angle and broke into 
whistling. He whistled a new 
ditty called, “The mermaid’s 
mother is a sure-firogong.” 

He was not a changed man, but 
he knew himself to be, in an ob- 
scure sort of way, a man of some 
mysterious importance. The gypsy 
had been sure of that. 

Framed against a black curtain, 
her greying hair half hid by a red 
silk cloth, her golden earrings a- 
glimmer in dim light, she had 
taken his big rough hand into her 
narrow brown one and had looked 
at his palm with professional pene- 
tration. 

After a moment her dark eyes 
had stared up at him in puzzle- 
ment. “Oh,” she’d said, “this is 
very unusual, very, very unusual. 
You’ll' live a very, very, very long 
time, Mr. Chu. You have a very 
unusual fate, one in ten billion. I 
can’t say what and I can’t say how. 
But if you’re willing, we could try 
the Tarot and the crystal to get a 
little more information.” 

So, after she explained to him 
that she’d never seen a man whose 
lifeline ran all the way to the tip of 
his index finger — the lifeline indi- 
cates time spent in this earthly di- 
mension, she’d said — and after 
they spent some time negotiating 
the price of Tarot and crystal; and 
after they settled on a lump-sum fee 
of twenty dollars; she’s reached for 
the cards. 

The Tarot confirmed the mes- 
sage of the palm. The gypsy was 
genuinely astonished by the cards. 
She repeatedly pointed at now this, 
now that part of the spread with an 
earring-jangling shake of her head. 


A famous man he was, would be, 
she murmured, more to herself 
than to him. His life, the length of 
it . She couldn’t, no, she 
couldn’t grasp how Mr. Chu could 
be so long lived, a regular Methuse- 
lah. He wanted to know the exact 
year, but on that score, she said, 
the cards were silent. 

They turned next to the crystal. 
She set up the ball in the middle of 
a table covered by a cloth whose 
edges showed the signs of the 
Zodiac. She dimmed the lights even 
more. And as Chu watched with 
half-open mouth, she went into a 
trance. Then, slowly, in hesitant 
bits and pieces, she conveyed the 
essence of the vision. 

Ice . ice . cold . bitter 
cold, she said. In the crystal 
Madam Sna saw crystals of ice. She 
saw or felt (she shivered at the im- 
mensity of the cold) such a depth of 
temperature, such an absence of 
heat, of warmth, that the mere ob- 
servation of it all turned her lips 
blue. In the midst of that crystal- 
line opposite of inferno, she 
thought she saw the form of Mr. 
Chu slowly, stiffly tumbling. And 
so she broke her concentration, and 
she summed it all up for him. 

“Mr. Chu,” she said, “you’ll live 
to an immense old age. You’ll be a 
sensation before you’re thirty. 
Many famous scientists will seek 
your counsel. And you’ll die some- 
day by freezing to death.” 

And so Chu whistled merrily as 
he walked. He crossed the street on 
a red light. Two cars bucked and 
screeched as they swerved to avoid 
running him down. He smiled at 
the angry honking. Nothing could 
harm him. He’d live to be a hun- 


122 


IF 



dred, no doubt about it. And next 
year, when he turned thirty, he’d 
already be a sensation. As for death 
by freezing, that was a long, long 
ways off. 

He didn’t wonder how he’d be- 
come a sensation or what the 
famous scientists might want to 
know: He very seldom wondered. 
This morning, momentarily, he’d 
wondered what it was all about. 
And that’d been entirely sufficient 
for a while. 

I^tow look at the matter from 
J^l another perspective, that of 
captain Bartholomew Smith, a 
small, portly man with a neatly 
blocked salt-and-pepper beard. 

Captain Bartholomew Smith 
commanded , the LNG Tanker 
Binivu. He was very close to retire- 
ment. His pension was in his 
pocket. He was a widower and 
childless. Forty years at sea had 
destroyed whatever enthusiasm 
he’d once had for oceanic magnifi- 
cence; he longed to be free of the 
brine. Already his interest was else- 
where; he had a nice packet of in- 
teresting investments, some very 
high- risk, some fairly safe. His 
heart was on the land, where his 
money was, even as he plowed 
Pacifica with a load of LNG. 

One of Captain Smith’s invest- 
ments was closer to his heart than 
any other, and as fate would have 
it. his favorite was also the least sol- 
vent of his ventures. It couldn’t 
even be called a venture, truth to 
tell. As yet it hadn’t gotten off the 
ground. It gave the Captain many 
hours of thought as he paced the 
deck of Binivu on the way to Japan 
and back ... on the way to Japan 


and back. He felt a certain respon- 
sibility for Eternity, Incorporated, 
being its single largest stockholder. 
He wanted El to succeed, and not 
only as a money-making venture. 
He hoped to be one of the clients of 
his own company when he died. 

El had everything: cold storage 
bunkers, a laboratory, and equip- 
ment. It had a front office, an 
answering service, and nice station- 
ary with an impressive letterhead (it 
featured the mathematician’s sym- 
bol for eternity, the lazy eight). El 
had a full time salesman, a 
part-time secretary, and a technical 
director, a certain Dr. Hatfield. 
Hatfield was not a medical doctor, 
strictly speaking, but the state had 
no objection to his handling of the 
dead. 

But Eternity, Incorporated lack- 
ed the most important ingredient of 
all — customers. Not a single person 
had signed up for frosty preserva- 
tion. EI‘s brochure had all the right 
blandishments (it had been pre- 
pared by a small advertising firm, 
another of the Captain’s invest- 
ments). It promised resurrection 
from death to anyone who’d pay the 
price of “perpetual care’’ of his 
body. Perpetuity, the brochure was 
quick to point out, had limits. As 
soon as Science discovered the 
secret to real longevity — or perhaps 
even to eternal life — you’ll be 
thawed out, dear customer, made 
young, and sent off fresh as a daisy 
into a brave new world. 

The company had the usual 
start-up troubles of a new techno- 
logical enterprise. El was still 
looking for the “first one.” Once 
they had a body in the vaults, once 
they could augment the sales bro- 


SUCH IS FATE 


123 



chure with a suitable photograph 
(one that showed the client’s serene 
smile without revealing his iden- 
tity), others would take courage 
and commit themselves to lie beside 
the “first one” awaiting the slow 

ripening of science. 

And so when a careless mainte- 
nance man fourth class by name of 
Sancho Jones Chu fell into an LNG 
tank and instantly froze to death — 
it happened in the Caribbean long 
before they reached the Panama 
Canal — and when Captain Barthol- 
omew Smith had ascertained that 
Chu was a man of uncertain origin 
and indeterminate race, he wired 
El at once. Dr. Hatfield, complete 
with a portable freeze chamber, 
met them in Panama, took charge 
of Chu, and flew back to Iowa the 
next day. 

Sancho Jones Chu became an El 
first. Over the years he was to 
acquire many a companion, includ- 
ing Captain Smith, and as time 
passed they shared many strange 
adventures. 

A d so there is the perspective of 
Father Time himself, the only 
person who could track that frozen 
cargo to eternity. 

El went bankrupt in 2198. It 
couldn’t Wait on Science any 
longer. Tax laws had changed. 
Energy costs were exorbitantly 
high. A new religiousness had 
spread like a bright girdle around 
earth’s shores, and the blandish- 
ments of survival by the mediation 
of Science had little appeal. 

The community of dead passed 
into the possession of a Cardinal of 
the Old Church Newly Revisited by 
the Spirit of the Almighty, known 


as the Visitors. The tax laws still 
permitted religious groups to 
accumulate wealth, and the Car- 
dinal, having tired of old masters 
(he had the finest collection of pop 
art in New Columbia) now turned 
his acquisitive instincts toward 
curiosities living, dead, and in be- 
tween, of which EI‘s necropolis was 
one of the finest. 

The vault passed down through 
five generations of the Cardinal’s 
family. His great-great-great- 
grandson had technical inclinations 
(a rarity in the 24th century which 
saw the completion of a slow 
relapse into superstition). Despite 
the family’s substantial wealth, fuel 
was so difficult to get that the sur- 
vival (?) of the deadd?) in the one- 
time El warehouse was threatened. 
The young Abbot converted the 
vault to run off solar energy. He 
developed a special, mobile hous- 
ing for the frozen inhabitants — it 
moved on wheels but could also 
float like a ship. The cooling system 
was renewed. The whole marvelous 
contraption (the Abbot called it the 
Ark of Time) was energized by a 
funnel-shaped flowering of panels 
mounted on the roof. He trans- 
ported the Ark to South America so 
that it would never lack solar fuel. 
Then he abandoned it on a Visitor 
mission to pursue other gadgets. 

And then came the Great Shak- 
ing and the centuries of interreg- 
num. 

The period acquired many 
names, including “Dark Ages.” 
Those who so named the interreg- 
num no longer knew that the term 
was already spoken for. The times 
were dark, so dark that even Father 
Time lost track of the Ark. For a 


124 


IF 



long time it might have stayed on 
that high Andean plateau where 
the Visitor Abbot had last seen it. 
Or it might have been pushed or 
driven off the mountain, lost in the 
jungle, or sent out to sea, away 
from the ravaging radiation that 
claimed so much of the earth’s land 
surface. At any rate, when the his- 
torical darkness lifted — it was the 
year 800 of the new reckoning and 
the world burst into flower again — 
Father Time looked for the Ark but 
couldn’t see it any more. It had 
vanished from its plateau. And 
since there was so much else to see, 
Father Time became distracted and 
forgot all about the matter. His 
perspective is no longer useful. 

npHE early ninth century. 

I Epiphany of the Era of 
structures. 

They came; in fifty years they’d 
conquered. They lasted for an eye- 
wink of eternity, and then they dis- 
appeared. But, oh! what grandeur, 
what vitality while they were domi- 
nant. Mankind had been given a 
new pulse of life. It was as if the 
Spirit of the Planet, called away for 
Cosmic Consultation, had returned 
of a sudden and had reached down 
with a glowing finger to quicken all 
earthly existence once again. Struc- 
ture-man lived a life of glory. He 
investigated all things, tried all 
things, dared all things. The arts, 
philosophy, faith, literature, archi- 
tecture, science, government awoke 
in the Ninth to a new and splendid 
life. The structures were an out- 
ward expression of an inner rebirth. 

What were these structures? 

They were immense vertical 
cities, cities of millions flung into 



the sky, resting on narrow strips of 
coastal land, each city a mile high 
on a square mile of ground, held 
aloft by a new discovery — gravitron 
vibration. 

They were a magnificent re- 
sponse to the conditions of the 
time. 

Here was a planet with a land 
surface virtually destroyed by radia- 
tion, its oceans filled with piratical, 
treacherous floating communities, 
its few plots of “safe earth” in the 
fierce possession of tribes, its erst- 
while cities ashes and rubble. 

And then came the structures. 
They rose up high, shining columns 
by the sea, so high they swayed in 
the wind. And culture was reborn 
within them. They rapidly gained 
the admiration of floaters, of 
tribes. The first supplied fish pro- 
tein, the second helium to cool the 


SUCH IS FATE 


125 



great gravitron drums. There was a 
crackling tension between Struc- 
ture and Hinterland, and from that 
tension was born a new civilization. 

So much for the setting. 

And now for a new perspective, 
that of a representative Structure 
man, a certain Dr. Fist, bright- 
eyed, vibrant, and insatiably 
curious, a master of many sciences 
and not a few arts, a consultant to 
government, a poet of some note. 
He had blue eyes, a blond beard, 
and a bald head. He laughed a lot 
and moved about in heavy robes of 
red always in the company of at 
least five graduate students, at least 
four of them female. 

The doctor had an interest in 
everything, but his interest in the 
matter at hand arose from the 
perusal of some ancient documents, 
an entire file cabinet filled with 
records of the Old Church Newly 
Revisited by the Spirit of the Al- 
mighty, papers miraculously pre- 
served by the grace of that almighty 
spirit, and discovered by a male 
graduate student on a lead-suited 
excursion into the radiation belt. 

And there, amidst arid sermons, 
construction estimates, missionary 
reports, and other odds and ends 
which only the voracious curiosity 
of Structure-man could endow with 
interest, Dr. Fist — who was, need- 
less to say, expert in all the dead 
languages — came upon a slender 
folder about the Ark of Time. Ap- 
pended to some plans, photos, and 
a press clipping or two, he also 
found a xerographic copy of a very 
ol4 encyclopedia article. It de- 
scribed the quaint custom of some 
ancients of freezing their dead, 
thinking they could be revived some 


day in the far distant future. 

The issue captured Dr. Fist’s 
fancy. All issues did, in fact. And 
Structure-man had energy to deal 
with all of them in an admirable 
way. Fist held forth about it to his 
coterie: 

“Imagine, children,’’ he cried, 
eyes aflame with wondrous zeal. 
“Somewhere on this planet there 
might still be frozen bodies a thou- 
sand years old. And we might suc- 
ceed in reviving them. We would, 
God willing! We would! If only we 
could lay our hands on the Ark of 
Time.’’ 

The probabilities were entirely 
against the project. The Great 
Shaking had made the foundations 
of the earth to tremble. Eight hun- 
dred years of unattended floating 
or standing would ruin even the 
plastosteel Ark with its clever 
flower- topped solar energy pack. 

And even if the Ark were found, 
why would Dr. Fist succeed where 
all others had failed? 

But precisely in this regard did 
Structure-man deviate from the 
pedestrian average of mankind — he 
bet against the probabilities, and 
he often won. 

So it was that Fist acted. He 
posted a large reward, and he sent 
out word to the tribes of Hinterland 
and to the men on the piratical 
floating ships. He wanted frozen 
bodies. He wanted the Ark. A 
picture of it went out from his 
structure by messenger along the 
helium pipeline. 

He won the first part of his bet. 
Ten years later a tribesman drove 
the Ark into Drinaldo Structure 
and asked for Dr. Fist. He had a 
faded copy of the notice and of the 


126 


IF 



drawing. He wanted his reward. 
The Ark: was battered. Its belly 
bore a fat belt of barnacles, its body 
was dented, one of its solar panels 
had been broken. But it was still 
more or less intact, a whale of a 
truck or vessel. 

Dr. Fist accepted the Ark as if it 
had been his rightful due. He 
rubbed his hands, his interest as 
lively as ever. The graduate stu- 
dents were a different crop but just 
as eager as the old ones. Fist 
opened the door of the Ark, saw the 
traceries of frozen air around the 
edges of the door, slammed it shut, 
nodded, and told someone to pay 
the tribesman. 

He ran off to make the prepara- 
tions in a swish of red robes. 

Fist also won the second part of 
his bet, at least in part. The Ark 
held forty bodies. Along the way 
Sixteen had been lost in ways that 
were mercifully hidden in the dark 
recesses of the Great Famine that 
had accompanied the Great 
Shaking. 

They set forth in a great labora- 
tory reeking of formaldehyde. They 
shared space with an anatomy pro- 
ject where Structure- man learned 
once more how man was "made, a 
knowledge that had been lost. 

They began with the old ones and 
saved the young to the last. They 
thawed them out — all at once, limb 
by limb, belly first, brain first. 
They gave them new blood, they 
shocked them with current, they 
massaged, pummelled, steamed, 
roasted. But nothing happened, 
and body after body was trans- 
ferred from the right side of the hall 
to the left — to serve the cause of 
science at last. Science learned that 


ancient man was just like modern 
man in all respects that mattered, 
but dental science had something 
of a boost — the ancient dentures 
caused quite a furor. 

Structure-man didn’t give up. 
Fist studied live and frozen cells 
under a microscope. He conducted 
tests. He electroprobed, irradiated. 
Gravitron irradiation seemed to 
help. The cells responded. Struc- 
ture-man had this advantage: he 
understood radiation like no other 
humanity before or since. Grav- 
vibes were, a truly new phe- 
nomenon. 

But then at last, spurred forward 
by small signs of success, Fist and 
his students made a key discovery. 
All of these men and women from 
the past had died of organic mal- 
functions. Fist could reconstitute 
them, in a manner of speaking, but 
in essence he labored to make fresh 
corpses from stale ones. The people 
were dead, and nothing helped, 
nothing at all, their livers were 
gone, their hearts had cracked, 
their brains were diseased. That is 
to say . all but one, all but one! 

That one was Sancho Jones Chu. 
Clipped to his ear was a blue tag 
that revealed his name and the date 
of his entombment, October 8, 
1998. He was the oldest of the 
ancients yet in a perverse way he 
seemed soundest of them all, fresh 
as a daisy. He’d died very quickly, 
the doctor decided. His organs were 
in immaculate state, his heart was 
strong, his brain solid, his lungs 
seemingly ready to breathe. His 
cells, much like those of the others, 
were ruptured from frost expan- 
sion, but for that Fist had found a 
remedy. 


SUCH IS FATE 


127 



Trembling with expectation, they 
carried Chu to the irradiation tube. 
Gently they placed him on metal 
springs. Gingerly they shoved him 
in, locked the door. Fist looked 
about at admiring faces and threw 
the switch. 

Five minutes later, with a tre- 
mendous banging and roaring — he 
nearly destroyed the delicate instru- 
ments — Chu came alive. 

The rest is a disappointing foot- 
note to history. 


W e can view it all from a 
multiple perspective — that of 
Structure sages who came from all 
over to question this phenomenon 
of the past — historians, linguists, 
musicians, doctors, engineers, 
military men. 

They came, erudite, eager, 
curious. 

They came to see the only man 
who had — until that time and, so 
far as we know' until ours — made a 
long trip into the future. They came 
to see Sancho Jones Chu, Time 
Traveler. 

And they learned nothing, de- 
spite their superior linguistic skills 
and mastery of interrogation. 

Chu had almost nothing to con- 
tribute. Oh, yes, he sang for them a 
ditty or two, like “The mermaid’s 
mother is a sure-fire gong.” He told 
them about LNG tankers (but 
Structure-men knew all about cryo- 
genics; their gravitron drums, after 
all, were cooled by liquid helium). 
He described the cities he had 
known, but through his eyes New 
York, Saigon, Vladivostok, Tokyo, 
Hamburg all had a certain seamy 
sameness. 


They tried, the sages, they tried 
valiantly. But Sancho Jones Chu 
, w as equal to the challenge. Even 
Structure-man gave up on him. 
The flood of delegations shrunk to 
a dribble, a drop, and then no one 
came any more. 

Chu drifted off, slowly. He jani- 
tored for the Institute where Dr. 
Fist had one of his centers of inves- 
tigation. But then Chu grew rest- 
less. He’d always been a wanderer. 
A rolling stone, he was, and gather- 
ed no moss. He learned enough of 
the language to get along and 
didn’t wonder much about the 
shape of the world because he 
simply didn’t winder. He worked 
his way down through the levels of 
Drinaldo Structure, from Level 169 
to the subterranean foundations 
where gravitron drums turned in 
the helium, Chu had a way, like all 
the rest of us, of finding his own 
level. He got work as a mainte- 
nance man. He did small chores, 
fixed plumbing. Over time he be- 
came something of a figure among 
his companions by dint of a strange 
accent and a penchant for clown- 
ing. He liked to show his courage 
and invulnerability — after all he’d 
lived to be a hundred. 

And then one day he clowned 
about near one of the grav drums. 
They’d pulled the insulating covers 
off the pits to find a leak. Sancho 
Jones Chu tightrope-walked across 
a beam over the pit. He turned to 
grin at his frow ning, angrily shout- 
ing comrades. He lost his balance, 
fell into the liquid helium, and in- 
stantly froze to death. 

He was one thousand two hun- 
dred and twenty-nine years old. 

Such is fate.

IF 




of the good things about do- 
If ing Best Science Fiction 
Stories of the Year is that it forces 
me to read a tremendous number of 
stories — and to think about what I 
read. In editing three of those 
anthologies I’ve learned a great 
deal about what science fiction 
really is and a 'little of what the 
limits of the field should be. 

I’m still not quite sure of just 
how far the limits of good science 
fiction can extend. Maybe, in time, 
I’ll arrive at some answer — but I 
doubt that it will be a final one. 
Still, 1 can’t resist putting down a 
few tentative conclusions. 

The proper range or extent of 
science fiction is certainly a lot 
greater than that of any other cate- 


gory of fiction, which is why it’s so 
hard to define. A mystery or a 
Western can be pretty sharply 
limited. It might be said to lie along 
a certain line, never going above or 
below that; it. can add a few de- 
tails — romance, character, emo- . 
tional moods, etc. — but it is still re- 
stricted by its nature. 

Science fiction, on the other 
hand, is more like a whole group of 
lines at different angles, all cross- 
ing in the center, like the spokes of 
a wheel. It can follow the angle of 
the mystery, the adventure, the his- 
torical, or even the various angles 
of the mainstream. We have every- 
thing from the pure gadget story of 
1 930 (unrelated to any other type of 
fiction) to the attempts at ‘pure 


129 



writing’ found in some late science 
fiction. We can even add large ele- 
ments of pure fantasy — usually 
masked by quasi-scientific explana- 
tions — or our own wild fantasy of 
psi powers run rampant. 

Good science fiction can be laid 
along any of those lines. There is 
room in the field for every type of 
fiction conceivable, and any 
attempt to create an Exclusion Act 
must ring false. Still, there are 
limits. Being laid in a theoretical 
future doesn’t make the novels of 
Alan Drury science fiction; neither 
does the excessive use of pseudo- 
scientific gadgets in Mission 
Impossible justify calling that series 
science fiction. 

Probably the closer the story is to 
that hypothetical center where the 
lines cross, the purer a story is as 
science fiction. It isn’t necessarily, 
however, a better science fiction 
story; in fact, the outstanding 
examples of science fiction usually 
are found fairly far out from that 
center. Dune , for instance, lies 
quite a ways out; so, in another 
direction, does “The Queen of Air 
and Darkness’’ and “The Nine 
Billion Names of God.” Also, the 
farther from the center one goes, 
the greater must be the creativity 
and skill of the writer to achieve 
success. 

I don’t know what the center Is, 
exactly. But I’ve been using a work- 
ing hypothesis which places the 
stories in the better magazines from 
1940 to about 1955 as somewhat 
typical of the central area. Using 
zero as a center and 100 as the ex- 
treme end of any line, those stories 
strike me as running within a circle 
out to about 25 or so. 


At the two extremes, running 
perhaps from 80 to 100, would be 
the very crude stories of the late 
20’s and early 30’s — all gadgetry, 
without much of any decent writing 
or character — and some of the 
so-called “new wave” stories of the 
late 60’s — all writing and char- 
acter, with almost no original idea 
or development. 

Some of the stories I choose for 
anthologization still run within that 
circle no further than 25; others 
run close to 75; but those are rarely 
my favorites. The ones I like best 
are probably somewhere between 
25 and 50. 

I suppose this means that science 
fiction is still evolving, and that the 
skill of the writers has improved on 
the average to permit them to move 
further from the center. Or perhaps 
it is my own taste that has changed 
over the course of the years. 

But in any event, science fiction 
is unlike other categories, which 
have few lines — if they have more 
than one — and which seem to stick 
within a range that 1 would class as 
0-15, with a few outstanding ones 
going out to perhaps 30! 


N one of the above has much to 
do with reviewing the current 
crop of books, though All Times 
Possible , by Gordon Eklund 

(DAW, 95«) does strike me as be- 
ing so far out from the center that it 
can barely be treated as science fic- 
tion. Eklund is one of the best of 
the newer writers, and he’s done 
some excellent science fiction. But 
here he seems only mildly concern- 
ed with the single element that 
justifies the label. 


130 


IF 



It’s theoretically a story of alter- 
nate worlds or possibilities. A man 
who calls himself Tommy Bloome 
tries to assassinate a fascistic type 
of leader in 1947 and is about to be 
shot for it. But instead, his un- 
harmed body and mind are cast 
back to the year of his birth. There 
he sets about the job of trying to 
change the future by turning 
America into a communistic 
dictatorship, at which he more or 
less succeeds, with himself the 
leader. But he finds out fairly early 
that this isn’t his world he’s taking 
over. It’s an alternate where there 
was no William Randolph Hearst, 
for instance; though strangely and 
without explanation, the Spanish 
American war seems to have been 
fought exactly the same without 
Hearst’s propaganda for it! 

But once we have the gimmick, 
there’s little more to the book that 
is science fiction. It’s a grim story, 
beautifully told. In general, Eklund 
digs down into most of his char- 
acters very well indeed — and this is 
a story of character throughout, 
and the effect of character on 
society and 'vice versa. It’s a good 
story — but it could have been just 
as good a story had it been laid in 
any time and place where such po- 
litical maneuvering could or did 
take place. 

Even aside from its not really be- 
ing science fiction, there are some 
flaws that bother me. The take- 
over by Tommy is sketched in too 
slightly. We see him inciting 
strikes — and then we see him after 
the Revolution is succeeding. We 
don’t really see how he managed his 
success. And that weakens our 
willingness to believe. And the final 


chapter, in trying to give a broader 
significance to the alternate possi- 
bilities, is confused and uncertain. 
Too much or too little can be read 
into it. 

It’s good reading for what it is, 
though not as thoroughly developed 
as I’d like; but it isn’t what readers 
pay for when they buy science 
fiction. 

W eb of everywhere, by John 
Brunner (Bantam, $1.25), is 
definitely science fiction, but I’m 
not sure anything else should be 
said for it. Brunner can be one of 
the better adventure writers of the 
field, dependably sure to have a 
good idea and to tell a good story. 
He can also be one of the most con- 
troversial writers of books that are 
bitter, sometimes satiric, and some- 
what experimental. But in this 
novel, he seems to have fallen some- 
where between the two types; and 
this writing between the cracks isn’t 
quite satisfactory. 

His gimmick is excellent. The 
world has invented something 
called the skelter (from helter- 
skelter?) which permits instant tele- 
portation from one to any other for 
which one has the code. As a result 
of this, the world went through a 
chaotic period of catastrophe, war, 
and population devastation. That 
might have made quite a story, 
from the hints we get of it. But this 
novel takes place after a measure of 
stability has returned, following the 
invention of a device to prevent un- 
authorized use of any skelter. 

The nominal main character is a 
talented but self-deceiving man

licitly obtain codes to houses aban-

doned during the collapse, intend- 
ing to take pictures and steal arti- 
facts for a posthumous record that 
will win him fame. This is a compli- 
cated story of his downfall as a 
human being. There’s also another, 
and far more interesting, char- 
acter — a bitter poet of the time who 
is amorally good. 

Unfortunately, the amoral poet 
is too divorced from the action and 
too well shielded by friends and ser- 
vants to let us see him well or to 
serve as a source of interest in the 
story. And Dykstra is more sinned 
against by fate than sinning. At 
best, 1 find most novels of evil being 
hoist on its own petard unreward- 
ing. But in this case, the evil of 
Dykstra is very petty, and the 
petard seems to be merely the blind 
workings of mischance, rather than 
any fault of his. 

There are moments of excel- 
lence, but 1 can’t recommend the 
novel. 

I can recommend a new book for 
those interested in teaching or 
criticising science fiction, and es- 
pecially for those who are trying to 
study the field for the first time. 
This is Science Fiction: and Intro- 
duction, by L. David Allen, M. A. 
(Cliffs Notes, Lincoln, Nebraska, 
$1.95). This is the first academic 
work meant to explain our field 
which I can genuinely applaud. 

There is a section on science 
fiction categories that serves as a 
good beginning, followed by 
analyses of fourteen novels; these 
are well chosen, beginning with one 
by Verne and one by Wells, and 
then going through a dozen that are 
excellent illustrative novels, repre- 


sentative of the best in current 
science fiction! There follows a 
thoughtful and' somewhat success- 
ful attempt to define science fiction 
followed by other useful pieces. The 
bibliography at the. end could only 
have been prepared by someone 
who has a wide acquaintance with 
the field and good judgment as to 
what is worth reading. 

In the past. I’ve been generally 
disgusted by most of the books 
about science fiction and the read- 
ing lists I’ve seen. With a couple of 
exceptions, these lists have been 
either archaic or so slanted that 
they don’t fairly represent us, and 
the books have labored more to ex- 
plain us away than to give any real 
information about us. 

This is a valid and most useful 
book — and one that should be a 
pleasure to read for anyone who 
likes science fiction and would wel- 
come a chance to see a reasonable 
criticism of it. I’m delighted to 
recommend it most highly! 

I ’m also happy to recommend a 
marvelous reference book that 
may not refer to science fiction but 
should be welcome to most readers, 
since it relates to the world of 
J.R.R. Tolkien. This has been 
available for some time in hard 
covers, but will now be available in 
a soft-cover edition, making it 
triply a bargain. 

The book is A Guide to Middle 
Earth, by Robert Foster (Ballan- 
tine, $1.50). It contains literally 
everything you wanted to know 
about Middle Earth and wete un- 
able to discover before. It more 
than proves my contention that the 
really great work of research in the 


IF 


132 



field of science fiction or fantasy is 
done by serious fans, rather than by 
professional researchers. 

A little over a year ago, I was 
teaching a course in fantasy at a 
university, and found the students 
asking questions that I simply 
didn’t have the time to answer 
through research in the original 
books. I found that in every case, 
Foster not only provided the 
answers, but he led on to further 
answers we hadn’t had the wit to 
find answers for. And I began to 
realize that there was all sorts of 
information in the book that I 
never would have discovered for 
myself. 

If you are just reading Tolkien, 
you’ll find the book invaluable 
whenever a name or place or thing 
comes up for which you have no 
memory. And if you’re already 
something of a student of Tolkien 
you’ll find your knowledge of 
Middle Earth deepened and enrich- 
ed by the material in this book. 

It’s arranged like a dictionary or 
glossary for convenience, with 
numerous cross references that can 
lead you on almost endlessly, or 
simply answer your immediate 
questions at once. 

If you like Tolkien, this is an 
absolute must for you! 

another must for collectors and 
/V libraries is a brochure put out 
b^fyperion Press, Inc., 45 River- 
side Avenue, Westport, Conn., 
06880. This is a list of 23 classics of 
science fiction they are publishing, 
as well as all the historical works on 
the field by Sam Moskowitz. I don’t 
intend to review all the books here, 
or even to list them, but the 


“classics” are books that have long 
been out of print and which, in 
many cases, are milestones of 
science fiction. They include works 
by L. Frank Baum, Robert W. 
Chambers, Ray Cummings, George 
Allan England, David H. Keller, A 
Merritt, Garrett P. Serviss, and 
Stanley G. Weinbaum, among 
many others. Among the books by 
Sam Moskowitz (who selected all 
the others) is his long out-of-print 
The Immortal Storm ($3.50 paper, 
$8.95 cloth). This is a history of 
early fandom, from the beginning 
until the days when it was be- 
coming almost respectable. It reads 
at times as if what went on in early 
fandom was far more important 
than all the other politics and wars 
of the world — and yet, that is 
precisely the way it has to read to 
give a true feeling of those days. No 
fan who wants to know the who and 
what and why of those days should 
miss it. Besides, it’s fun to read. 

The other books also come in 
paper covers (as well as cloth) for 
prices that range from $2.95 to 
$5.75. Like the cloth-bound ver- 
sions, these are printed on ex- 
tremely high-grade paper that 
should last for hundreds of years, 
and their binding is standard book 
binding, rather than the glue-and- 
hope stuff usually used for soft- 
bound books. 

The brochure lists the books with 
summaries of their plots and im- 
portance. I’d recommend it for 
anyone seriously interested in ob- 
taining some of these classic novels.

HE SECOND EXPERIMENT, by 

J. O. Jeppson (Houghton, 
ifflin, $6.95), is a curious novel

which seems in some ways to be re- 
lated more to those early novels of 
our field than to most that are 
being written today. It has the cos- 
mic sweep of serials that were 
running back around 1930 and 
covers a span of some seventy 
million years, sweeping from one 
edge of the galaxy to Earth and 
then far beyond, until we find our- 
selves battling to preserve the 
Magellanic clouds. 

Unfortunately, some of the writ- 
ing also resembles that being done 
back then. There are moments of 
quiet when the writing becomes 
quite effective, but usually we’re 
rushed from event to event — from 
alien gods to robotic evil beings and 
mutated dinosaurs, from psi to 
alpha rhythms and on to unlimited 
powers between systems of uni- 
verses. The characters are usually 
rather simple, with good and evil 
starkly separated, though not un- 
changeable. 

It’s a strange book. But if you’re 
looking for the old sense of wonder 
laid on with a vengeance, this has 
it! 


and finally, a bit of publishing 
folly which is such a good book 
ofrts kind that I can’t overlook it, 
even though it’s fantasy, not 
science fiction. The Forgotten 
Beasts of Eld, by Patricia A. 
McKillip (Atheneum, $7.25), 
should be reaching the libraries by 
the time this is in print. You won’t 
find it in many of the bookstores or 
adult libraries, however, since the 
publisher mistakenly thinks it’s a 
juvenile for ages “11 up.’’ The up is 
correct — very much up. I don’t 


know of any fantasy novel 1 would 
call more genuinely adult in every 
good meaning of the word! 

It’s about a wizard-woman 
named Sybel in the countries 
around Eld. The background is 
vaguely medieval (perhaps Celtic). 
She has the power to call up all the 
legendary beasts — magical beasts — 
of that world and keep them in her 
power. And with them she exists, 
cut off from the world, until she is 
forced to adopt a child. From then 
on, she’s entrapped into the world 
and the struggles of men; and her 
character and power are sadly tried 
and tempted. 

It’s a hard book to describe, 
since there’s a marvelous subtlety 
to its development. Repeatedly, the 
great discovery or event that could 
be the ending in a lesser writer’s 
hands is developed early in the plot, 
leaving us to go on to a deeper and 
more fascinating story. 

The real ending, when it comes, 
is that most wonderful resolution — 
one which is inevitable but unex- 
pected. 

This is a true fairy tale in its 
telling and its development- — but 
fairy tales were not originally for 
children, and this one is too real, 
too complex, too soundly based on 
character, for the term juvenile to 
apply. Maybe someday it will be 
out in soft covers, with a better title 
than the awkward one it now has. 
(I’m hoping to promote The Calling 
of Sybel as a much truer title — in 
all the meanings of that second 
word.) 

Meantime, if you like fantasy, try 
to find this. I haven’t enjoyed a fan- 
tasy as much since I first discovered 
Tolkien! •

over Dulles makes up for lost op- 
portunity, doesn’t it? 

I’m glad I quit last week. I don’t 
have to be there. I’ve seen more 
death in the last few months than 
I’ll ever take from nightmares. 
Plane crashes, earthquakes, and 
that ghastly subway fire in Boston. 
The radiation accident in Arizona. 
The building collapse here in mid- 
town. It never got easier. No matter 
how often I forgot how it was for 
them at the end, it just never got 
easier. 

When I told Sam I quit, that I 
couldn’t take the deaths anymore, 
he didn’t even look up from the re- 
port on his desk. Even though I ex- 
pected this, it hurt. I found myself 
making all the old, useless accusa- 
tions about Julie while he delivered 
his usual talk about how all we 
would have without her would be a 
dingy office and a file of reports on 
people with high scores on Rhine- 
card runs. What he really meant 
was that his picture would be off 
the cover of Life , we wouldn’t be in 
the throes of a not-too-friendly di- 
vorce, and I wouldn’t be halfway 
down the yellow brick road to a ner- 
vous breakdown. When I left, I 
heard him dialing. Julie, of course. 
From whom all blessings and etc. 

The juvenile authorities dumped 
her on us eight months ago. They 
were as glad to get rid of her as we 
to take over. Glad? .God help us, 
we were sick with happiness. 

Sam and I had just about run out 
of money, faith and time. We had 


almost completed a year’s sabba- 
tical from Duke that we had taken 
to find and utilize psychically 
talented people for the Nation’s 
Good. Our progress had not been 
spectacular. We had plenty of files 
on people who thought they could 
teleport or levitate but couldn’t. 
We had some more on people who 
could light a match by concen- 
trating long enough, except under 
direct observation. Somewhere out 
there were the telepaths and levita- 
tors and precogs and all the rest. 
But they hadn’t come to us — and 
we hadn’t been able to find them. 

Understandable, of course. If I 
were a high level telepath instead of 
a low level empath, I’m not sure 
that I'd advertise the fact. Salem 
wasn’t that long ago, folks. Julie 
Albertson came along when we 
desperately needed her. 

The first time the police noticed 
her on the scene of a fire, they 
tagged her as another spectator and 
likewise the second and third. The 
fourth, at a really nasty apartment 
fire, they busted her for arson. 
Shortly, when the specialists pin- 
pointed the cause as faulty wiring, 
Julie was released with apologies 
and considerable embarrassment. 
Two weeks later, another massive 
fire broke out at a grade school. 
Reliable witnesses put Julie on the 
scene at least twenty minutes before 
the alarm and the police pulled her 
in again. And released her again 
when the verdict of accidental ori- 
gin came. 


136 


IF 



The sixth time, a week after that, 
they called us. 

We picked her up at Juvenile 
Detention and when they brought 
her out, I could feel the cold, steady 
hate. Julie Albertson. Her mother 
who hadn’t seen her in a year and 
“good riddance anyway” had told 
the authorities that Julie was seven- 
teen, a liar, and a tramp. None of 
this had led me to expect a grimy 
but pretty child with long blonde 
hair. She was long-legged and 
skinny — am I trying to say colt- 
ish? — and wearing wrinkle-tight 
jeans and sweater that only flatter 
the very thin and young. 

Seeing her, I had a flash of retro- 
spect: how it felt to be that young. 

Thirty-two had never seemed 
older. Then she looked at me and I 
felt young again. 

Those eyes. Blue and closed and 
hard. Hooker’s eyes, holding in 
everything, giving out nothing. 

While Sam went off to sign the 
papers, I looked up the detective I 
had worked with during my stint as 
a human lie detector. After I had 
helped him nail several by moni- 
toring their emotions during ques- 
tioning, he had become a believer. 
He was the one who had suggested 
Sam and me as the solution to 
Julie. “She scares me,” he said re- 
assuringly, “my brother-in-law was 
one of the firemen at that grade 
school fire. Twenty-eight kids had 
died and he saw that one standing 
there, smiling the whole time like it 
was a circus.” 


I didn’t mention this to Sam. 
The last few days he had been hope- 
ful again, after weeks of growing 
despair. He suspected Julie was a 
precog and able to see the fires be- 
fore they happened. I didn’t want 
to take advantage of his good 
mood. Our marriage, never exactly 
stable, had been fraying more than 
usual under his failure. Maybe if 
Julie turned out to be what he 
hoped the pressure would lift for a 
time and I could make some repairs 
in our relationship. But I agreed 
with the cop. Julie scared me. 

Sam, though, was all enthu- 
siasm. He sat next to her on the 
ride home oozing concern and 
trustworthiness. He asked her about 
herself and her dreams and any- 
thing else that might open her up. 
Usually Sam’s charm works with 
the ladies. Sometimes too well. 

Julie, however, just sat, alter- 
nately staring through the window 
and peeling crimson polish from 
her ragged fingernails. Sam got 
nothing from her but mumbles and • 
shrugs. 

He waited until we were back 
home near Du Pont Circle to try his 
surefire, shake-em-up stunt. Julie 
was slumped on the couch in the 
living room. Sam levitated the 
queen from the chess set on the 
table and floated it over to her, 
letting it bob in front of her eyes. 
It’s his only psychic talent. 

Julie’s eyes bugged. “Did you do 
that?” she said when the queen 
came down. 


JULIE 


137 



“Sure,” he said, “and I think 
you can do the same sort of thing. 
In fact, I think you have.” 

“Me?” 

“The fires,” he said. 

Nothing. She looked defiant but 
I thought it was fear and wondered 
why she rt was afraid now when she 
hadn’t been with the police. 

Sam went on, “I know what you 
did.” 

The fear doubled and became al- 
most panic. It sent waves through 
me. 

“I think you saw those fires be- 
fore they happened.” 

The fear went away. She thumb- 
ed the hair behind her ears. 
“Yeah,” she said, “I saw them. I 
didn’t want to tell the fuzz but — ” 
She smiled hesitantly, “I saw them 
kind of like in a vision. I’ve always 
seen stuff like that.” 

I’d been letting Sam handle it. 
Why not? But the image of those 
children in that school bothered 
me. More coldly than I meant to I 
said, “If you knew, why didn’t you 
tell someone?” 

“Who’s going to believe if I tell 
them a fire’s gonna start?” she 
said. 

Sam hurried to her defense. I 
knew it was a move to gain her con- 
fidence but it irritated me. “Julie’s 
right. No one would have believed 
her, and she probably feels worse 
about those kids than you do.” 

He was watching me and didn’t 
see Julie’s smile. I could imagine 
that smile at another time . 


T he fight we had after Julie had 
been settled in the guest room 
wasn’t our first, but the first over 
Julie. “Look Erika,” he said when I 
had finished my reservations, “I’ll 
grant you that she’s not your 
normal seventeen year old kid. But 
she’s a pre-cog!” 

“She’s a monster who enjoys 
watching people die. If she had told 
the authorities a fire was going to 
start, sure the first time they’d have 
written her off as a crackpot. But 
the third time? The sixth? She 
didn’t warn anyone because she 
wanted those fires, do you under- 
stand that?” 

I could see Sam was getting 
angry but he said quietly, “Yoy 
aren’t even trying to understand. 
All right, maybe — and I won’t ac- 
cept it, but maybe — she does enjoy 
watching death. If you’d been 
having visions of disasters since you 
were young, how would you react?” 
“Differently.” 

“No? Then you’d have probably 
gone mad. My feeling is that her 
lack of concern is an adjustment, 
her defense against a phenomenon 
that must have scared her silly in 
the beginning.” 

“All right,” I said. It made some 
sense and I loved him. “You’ve got 
a point. I’ll give her a chance. But I 
don’t expect a thing from her.” 

T he change in Julie over the 
next few days was close to some- 
thing, however. The hard-case per- 
sonality was discarded, along with 


138 


IF 



the layers of mascara and the 
trashy clothes. In its place appear- 
ed a sweet-faced blonde angel, 
cheerful and oh-so-eager to learn. 
Sam kept murmuring about The 
Right Environment and Those Who 
Finally Understood. I wanted a 
miracle. But when I looked under- 
neath, I still saw the Julie who 
smiled at death. 

Like most resident astrologers 
and clairvoyants and such, Sam 
had been on a local television talk 
show a few times. When they asked 
him back later that month, he took 
Julie with him. Despite my misgiv- 
ings about her, I had none of her 
talent. The disasters she predict- 
ed — and that seemed to be all she 
could predict — were inevitably front 
page the next day. On the talk 
show, outfitted in a demure dress 
and newly acquired manners, she 
foresaw a private plane crash with 
just the right note of dismay in her 
soft voice while Sam smiled fatu- 
ously. The next morning, after her 
prediction proved correct, the front 
porch was awash with reporters and 
curiosity seekers. Within a week 
she had made three more appear- 
ances and three more correct (and 
terrible) predictions. Requests 
came. Sam opened new offices. He 
looked for a staff. 

And that was the point of no re- 
turn. Julie was now responsible for 
Sam’s success and the vindication 
of his theories. With each tragedy — 
and once people began to believe, 
some were averted or lessened by 


preparation — her fame and Sam’s 
grew. Julie always made a point of 
crediting him with the development 
of her gift. 

And he deserved that credit. He 
worked with her for hours each day 
to increase her physical range. 
Soon she was picking up impending 
large-scale disasters as far as three 
thousand miles away. But he failed 
to increase the time limit on her 
perception. It had never been more 
than an hour; it averaged half of 
that . and following a predic- 
tion, she couldn’t pick up a thing 
for a while. The larger the disaster, 
the longer the disappearance of her 
gift. 

Power drain, Sam said. 

But even with those limitations, 
she saved lives. Acceptance became 
adulation. Grateful thousands over- 
whelmed her with gifts and money 
began to come in from places that 
had never answered our letters be- 
fore. Slowly, other psychics — al- 
though none so spectacular as 
Julie — came crawling out, seeking 
the fame she had received. They 
felt safer, perhaps, because the 
world loved our Julie. 

But I didn’t. I couldn’t. When- 
ever a predicted disaster came 
near, I tuned in on her emotions 
and they were always the same: 
pleasure and a terrible insatiable 
thing which I could only interpret 
as lust. And it became stronger. 
Often, when a disaster had not 
been averted, the authorities asked 
me to reach for the lingering, last

emotions of the dead to help them 
judge if a pilot had had some warn- 
ing before a crash or if a murderer 
had killed with or without pre- 
meditation. Sam and Julie stayed 
near me on these investigations. In- 
evitably I’d end up concentrating 
on Julie instead of the victims. I 
monitored her morbidly. 

And became certain. 

I should have told Sam when I 
first suspected. I waited too 
long. I had wanted to be wrong 
about her for Sam’s sake so I wait- 
ed .. and then he wouldn’t listen. 

From the first, Julie had haunted 
our house and relationship. When- 
ever I managed to pry Sam from his 
work for a party or an increasingly 
rare dinner, Julie had a nasty habit 
of having a prediction. When he 
invariably hurried off I made a 
show of being understanding . 
at first. But the night Julie inter- 
rupted our first evening together in 
two months with a prediction of a 
mine collapse, I exploded. 

He put down the phone and told 
me what she had said. 

“That was nice. At least she gave 
us a start together tonight.” 

“Not again.” 

“I can’t stand it.” 

He put on his coat. “Damn it, 
Erika, she apologized for us before 
she told me! What else can she 
do?” 

“She always apologizes. You’re 
not an empath, Sam. It’s strictly 
for public consumption. And that 


one-hour limit on predictions!” 
“What do you mean?” 

“I’ll tell you what I mean,” I 
said, “she can see as far ahead as 
she wants. She just doesn’t want to. 
If she prevented all the dying, what 
would she do for fun?” 

“Erika!” 

“Don’t sound shocked,” 1 said. 
“Last week when we got there with 
the police just in time to prevent 
that murder-suicide, you were ec- 
static because we saved two lives. 
While the police were hauling the 
man away, Julie was staring at him. 
You didn’t watch, Sam; she looked 
like someone was making love to 
her. I don’t know if she’s a sadist or 
a necrophiliac or something even 
worse, but she’s sick. And she’s de- 
laying her predictions for fun.” 
The angry denial I expected 
didn’t come. “Listen, Erika,” he 
said, “I know how you feel. Things 
have been hard on you lately. But 
Julie isn’t responsible for a talent 
that’s more spectacular than yours 
any more than she can help being 
younger. Or — ” 

“Prettier?” 

“I didn’t say that.” 

“You would have. I couldn’t 
stand to hear you say it.” I looked 
at him, trying to see my husband 
through Julie’s eyes. Tall, blond, a 
few gray hairs and wrinkles around 
the eyes, but quite acceptable. 
“I’ve gotten used to your other 
women, Sam,” I said, “but isn’t 
this one a little young?” 

“Wait a minute!” 


140 


IF 



“I wonder if she really feels for 
you or she’s just trying to get at 
me.” 

The anger came, then. “I knew 
you were jealous, but this is crazy,” 
Sam said. 

‘‘Crazy? Because you never 
thought I’d find out. I was so busy 
concentrating on Julie and worry- 
ing about you that I didn’t even 
think about the possibility of this. 
But are you really dense enough to 
think I haven’t known about the 
others?” 

‘‘What others?” 

‘‘Yes,” I said, ‘‘I guess you are. 
So I let you get away with your 
playing around because I love you 
and wanted you here. But not this 
time. Not now.” 

‘‘What are you going to do?” 

‘‘Nothing. Nothing at all. It’s up 
to you.” 

He looked at me for a minute, 
turned and walked out the door. 
His choice. It wasn’t a choice be- 
tween Julie and me so much as be- 
tween me and everything he had 
wanted to be. 

Afterward, I continued working 
with him though. 

W e were civil at the office. I 
wanted some tangible evi- 
dence to support my suspicions 
about Julie. But it didn’t come, and 
just before he and Julie left for a 
personal appearance swing on the 
coast, the office gossip and ac- 
cumulated death made me decide 
to quit. I had told no one but Sam 


of my suspicions. Anything I said 
would have been written down as 
jealousy. And until today I really 
didn’t have any evidence. Now, I’ve 
seen the monster. 

I still have a key to the office. 
Knowing they’d be at the crash- 
site, I came in to poke around. In a 
drawer of Julie's desk, under piles 
of other things, I found a small 
diary filled with notations in a 
round scrawl. In the back was a 
careful listing of her predictions — 
including today’s crash. She hasn’t 
been in here since Friday, three 
days ago. So much for her time 
limit. 

Then, I went through the rest of 
the diary and discovered that I was 
wrong. That wasn’t it at all. No 
wonder Julie had been frightened 
when Sam announced he knew 
what she was doing, back at the be- 
ginning. 

Julie’s not a pre-cog. 

She hasn’t been gaining range 
and control but power and imagi- 
nation. No wonder there’s a 
‘‘drain” after a prediction. Just 
think how much psychic energy it 
must have taken to make those two 
jets collide. 

I thought of taking the evidence 
to Sam. But he had made the 
choice: he had gone with her. 

So I’m taking it to the press. And 
while I’m at it, I think I’ll tell them 
that Sam has known all along what 
she’s been doing. 

And come to think of it, I believe 
the bastard has. *

JF DIALOG #1 

Come with me down to the sub- 
basement. Down the winding stone 
passageways. Listen to the drip 
drip of seeping water. Hear the 
echoes of our steps. Listen to your 
loud, frightened breathing. 

Here’s the door. I slowly unlock 
the huge padlocks, slide the rusty 
bolts. The arched, iron-bound 
wooden door creaks open. 

We enter. I lift the lantern 
high . 

There he is, hunched in a corner 
beside a teetering stack of ancient 
pulp Amazings. He is chewing the 
bones and sinews of an unwary 
author. 

You cry out in a low, strangled 
voice, “Th-that’s your alter-ego, 
Geis?” 

I nod grimly. “Not a pretty sight, 
but such things rarely are.” 

Alter lifts his head. He tosses 
Alan Dean Foster’s left narrative 
bone into a passageway between 
looming, overloaded shelves. His 
feral eyes gleam. His hungry gaze 


fastens on you as he speaks to me. 

“My next victim, Geis?’’ His 
voice is Demonic, horrible, intense. 

“No, Alter. This is a reader, an 
observer. He is one of those we 
serve.’’ 

“So this is what they look like. I 
think we’ve wasted our time.’’ 
“Don’t be cynical. Readers are 
sacred. They’re an endangered 
species. We must protect — *’ 

“I believe in the survival of the 
fittest. Let them die out if they 
can’t survive in this world. They’ll 
have to get smart or get extinct.’’ 
“But where would we be without 
readers?’’ 

“Writing short captions in big 
type for picture magazines. ‘This is 
Senator Blah Blah. See him vote for 
good laws. He is a good man.’’’ 
“Alright, Alter. How would you 
advise readers to survive?’’ 
“They’ve got to get better food to 
read. They’ve got to stop accepting 
this junk-reading editors have been 
feeding them. They’ve got to write 
letters, yell and scream for a better 
diet.’’ 


142 



“And of course you know all 
about the proper care and feeding 
of readers.” 

“Yes, Geis. Don’t be sarcastic. 
I’m an alter-ego. I'm down here 
where the nitty grates against the 
gritty and the Id howls all the 
time.” 

“But this gentleman here is a 
specialized reader. He’s a science- 
fiction reader. He is mostly 
interested in ideas and sense-of- 
wonder concepts and — ” 

“And that’s a lot of bull. I read 
this stuff till my eyes burn, candle 
after candle, tin plate full of swill 
after tin plate full of swill, sleep 
after sleep, year after year, and I’ve 
been telling you and telling you, 
Geis, science fiction is still fiction, 
and fiction is an art-form that 
operates primarily in emotions. Or, 
it should. Most science fiction 
writers act as if emotion is a 
four-letter word.” 

“And I keep telling you. Alter, 
that s-f is a literature of ideas!” 
“You dumb orange-sucker! 
That’s why readers, and especially 
science-fiction readers are dying 
ouL— the main ingredient of good 
fiction writing is largely missing in 
s-f. Ideas and sense-of-wonder on 
an intellectual level can be pre- 
sented in an essay ... in articles. 
Fiction is drama — emotional situa- 
tion — with the reader emotionally 
involved with tjhe characters, living 
the story, in it. When was the last 
time a character in an s-f story 
came alive for you? When was the 
last time you gave a real damn if he 
lived or died? — and really cared 
how the story came out?” 

“Well . .” 

“Look at that reader you brought 


in here. See how famished he is? 
What does he get? Cardboard, for 
God’s sake! Half-assed stories with 
limp, underdone endings. Some 
stories with no endings at all. How 
can a reader stay healthy on fare 
like that?” 

“But ideas—” 

“Ideas are what determine the 
shape of the cake, the flavor, the 
color, the frosting, but emotions 
are the eggs and flower and short- 
ening.” 

“Sometimes your analogies. 
Alter—” 

“Shut up, Geis. Readers are 
hungry for gut-emotions, but it 
seems like most writers are afraid 
to deal in them. Or even em- 
barrassed to use them.” 

“You always have been a blood- 
thirsty creature. You tend — ” 

"Will you shut up? My point — ” 
“What do you want, R-rated 
stories in s-f magazines?” 

“You’re damn right! I want some 
stories, not all, but some, which 
sink hooks so deep into a reader’s 
guts he’ll carry scars the rest of his 
life.” 

"You ask too much.” 

“Why? I want, as a reader, to get 
into a character who really cares 
about something. I want emotion. I 
don’t want to read about a blood- 
less, passionless, name, a cutout 
who doesn’t have a body;” 

“Now, you know sex is — ” 

“Sex is not what I’m getting at. I 
want people in the fiction I read to 
sweat and stink and have gas and 
occasionally think ugly thoughts 
and eat too much pie and love to 
play ping-pong and look longing- 
ly .. or indifferently ... at a 
member of the opposite sex and 


143 



who have to be reminded to get 
their hair cut — while they are being 
realistically heroic or competent or 
incompetent in coping with future 
life-and-death problems. That’s 
all.” 

“Don’t whine. Alter. I hate a 
sniveling alter-ego.” 

“If that’s asking too much, Geis, 
I’ll set tire to these Archives. I’ll — ” 
“On the other hand — there’s fic- 
tion to your taste once in a while in 
the magazines.” 

“Name three.” 

“Well, Dying Inside by Bob 
Silverberg, Project 40 by Frank 
Herbert . .” 

“Uh-huh. Go on.” 

“Well . ummm . Ray Nel- 
son isn’t afraid to write about real 
human beings. And Richard 
Lupoff and Phil Farmer on oc- 
casion, and / have been known — ” 
“I’m not talking about porno, 
Geis. Where are my matches?” 
“Ellison! Harlan Ellison is be- 
coming known for his recent vio- 
lent, graphic, sledgehammer fan- 
tasies.” 

"Yeah ... ‘A Boy and His Dog’ 
where the boy and his dog end up 
eating the girl. And ‘Bleeding 
Stones’ where stone creatures come 
alive on a church as a result of 
smog and other pollutants and 
ravage a huge crowd of young re- 
ligious fanatics. Very acidly ironic 
and relevant. But that is shock 
value realism — hit’em hard enough 
and they’ll remember your story 
forever — and I want everyday 
honest real realism. You want me 
to burn thesestacks from A to Z or 
Z toward A? Any favorite author 
you want torched first?” 

“Well, you might singe Stanislaw 


Lem a bit — NO! Alter, if you touch 
flame to a single page of these pre- 
cious book and magazines I’ll 
throw you dowm the Hole.” 

“N-not that!” *cringe* “Why . 
even Ted White wouldn’t do that to 
Harry Harrison!” 

“Yes — that. But you need not 
fear as long as you behave. Remem- 
ber, we must keep one thing per- 
fectly clear: I am the resident! You 
may snarl and growl and eat stray 
authors now' and then, but you and 
1 have a Duty to serve and protect 
science fiction and fantasy.” 

“ Fauugh ! Your dedication is not 
normal, Geis. It reeks of avoidance 
mechanisms and Games.” 

“Do not spout psychology at me. 
Alter. You can be repressed, you 
know.” 

“Go ahead. Repress me! I need a 
nice, quiet vacation. I’d like 
nothing better than to get back to 
my used synapse collection. I’m 
years behind in my cataloging and 
mounting.” 

“You’ll get more years behind 
before I’m through with you. Now, 
finish your stupid complaints about 
True Realism in s-f and fantasy. 
I’ve spent enough time with you.” 
“I hate you with a hate, Geis, a 
hate that — ” 

“Alright, I’ll finish for you. You 
think a real guy or gal can be heroic 
and can w in and solve and struggle 
to a solid conclusion while still 
being less than ideal and less than 
totally virtuous.” 

“Something like that. Of course 
that kind of w riting requires special 
skills and special minds, and since 
99% of current science fiction and 
fantasy is written by incom- 
petents — ” 


144 


IF 



“ What sacrilege is this?” 

“ — and for some strange reason, 
Geis, it is very difficult to create an 
honest, whole character in a few 
well chosen words, weave him or 
her into an s-f story and make it all 
blend and work together. Good 
writing in one aspect of a story re- 
quires equally good writing in all 
other areas.” 

“But—” 

“Why would a fine writer waste 
his time with low-paying science 
fiction or the very low-paying fan- 
tasy field?” 

“We have good writers!” 

“Good, yes. Some good preten- 
tious writers, some good hack 
writers, some good earnest message 
writers, some good specialized 
writers . but only two or three 
who can put it all together consis- 
tently.” 

“Alter, stop! You’re shocking 
the reader. His eyes are wide. He’s 
twitching and making soft mewing 
sounds.” 

“He has to know the truth some- 
time. We don’t get top quality s-f 
except by accident — a good writer 
will once in a while rise to a peak 
and create a first class work ... or 
a young quality writer will hit our 
genre like a comet as he passes 
through to bigger markets and 
higher fame.” 

"//’ that's true . Why am I 
saving all this second-rate writing? 
Why not bum it? Could you 
possibly be right? Have I wasted 
our lives? why do you do this to 
me?” 

“Don’t carry on like that, Geis. I 
hate bad acting. An atomic bomb 
couldn’t shake you. You have dug 
yourself a niche, here, and it gives 


direction and meaning to our lives. 
So you make the most of it. Admit 
it.” 

“You . go . too . far. I 
warn thee — ” 

“Okay, okay! I withdraw my last 
few statements. C-close the Hole. 
I’ll just make a final argument or 
two — ” 

“Get on with it!” 

“Right. I’m sick and tired of 
shallow realism — slick realism — a 
kind of pro forma, automatic, hack 
realism that has emerged in the last 
few years in s-f and fantasy writing. 
A few soft-core swear words, a few 
anatomical references, a few sex 
scenes devoid of eroticism.” 

“After all. Alter, the little old 
ladies in tennis shoes are still Out 
There, still ready to pounce and 
scream if an editor publishes any- 
thing too porno-ish.” 

“Geis, you nerd, I don’t want 
porno in s-f and fantasy! I just want 
real people in science fiction. I 
want ... I want Richard Nixon in 
science fiction!” 

* Shocked Silence* 

“And I w'ant whole women in 
science fiction, and whole chil- 
dren . and whole cultures and 
w hole future societies and whole — ” 
“Come on, reader. He’s flipped 
out again. He does this a couple 
times a year. The next phase is in- 
coherent ranting and babbling. 
Then fitful weeping. I hate to see 
him weep.” 

I relock the door. I lead the way 
back up to the ground floor. I

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 


145 



"W TNSOLICITED TESTIMONIAL AND 
YOU READ IT HERE FIRST 

Philip K. Dick wrote a letter to 
me the other day (May 8, to be pin- 
pointy) which he wished published. 
He assumed it would be in The 
Alien Critic, but here it gets a wider 
audience, and here it pleases me to 
publish the whole thing. 

“Dear Dick, 

“Just wanted to say that in Eng- 
land the S-F journal Foundation 
seems to be following your lead as a 
forum where all sorts of meaningful 
(and meaningless, as well) com- 
ments about S-F can appear and be 
read — throughout the world. 

“ Foundation admits that a cer- 
tain rare courage is needed to do 
this. I think you have it, and I’d 
like to tell you this. 

“I hear from people in England 
who cite The Alien Critic as the 
place where they read such-and- 
such, so you do get around. In my 
opinion you are doing an acutely 
valuable job, and Foundation 
is/will be doing so, too, in their 
country. 

“While I’m writing you I might 
mention the new novel I’m consid- 
ering writing; it has to do with the 
phonograph-record business, which 
I was involved with, at the retail 
end, for over seven years. I guess 
I’ll make it a S-F novel, though, 
setting it in the future. My memory 
tapes (so to speak) have few if any 
gaps in them about my years in the 
record business, what with the rip- 
offs and payola. The small profits 
for the retailer, the huge chains 


that are wholesalers-retailers who 
crowd out the little guy. 

“Provisionally, I will call the 
record company dogshit records 
inc. (Or dri, as they now have emi, 
rca, mca, etc.) In my head I’ve 
blocked out the story of an android 
who has an agent who is another 
android, but neither knows the 
other is an invader. (There is a sort 
of mutual surprise ending, but the 
main thing is to lay forth the inner 
workings of an industry or our 
readership, in a novel of the sort I 
tend to write and they tend to 
read.) The musical artist’.s agent is 
named (are you ready?) Skim 
Morewithit, and so forth. There are 
rip-offs of royalties, two sets of 
books, all the usual stuff you find 
today and yesterday in the record 
business. As to locale, I haven’t de- 
cided. Maybe on Jupiter, because it 
will be a (ahem) heavy novel.’’ 

M y comments: Foundation is 
an. improving s-f journal — 
t like a mouse between the 
cat of its academic readers and 
supporters, and the popularity- 
baited trap of needing subscrip- 
tions from the fans and average s-f 
readers who usually take one look 
at professional writing and run 
away. 

Peter Nicholls is now Founda- 
tions editor, a well-read, sharp- 
thinking man who is trying to 
thread a line between too much 
stuffy analytical writing and too 
much “popularized” writing and 
features. 

Foundation at the moment is too 
straight-laced and dignified for my 
taste, but I’m so low-brow most

people can't find my forehead.

trator, The Science Fiction Foun- 
dation, North East London Poly- 
technic, Longbridge Road, Dagen- 
ham, Essex, RM8, 2AS, England. 

Phil’s projected novel (which I 
hope he will write but which I fear 
is a joke) prompts speculation as to 
possible titles. I might suggest Uni - 
versal Disc Flogger, or $5. 95 RPM, 
or Spin Me, Said the Poo-Poo Man.

there.)

HE Wl(ZARD) OF (oz) = ZARDOZ 
REVIEW DEPT. 

guess I’m just unlucky. An old 
friend came over last night, and to 
avoid playing chess with him and 
listening to his endless troubles 
(which 1 was buried under, in the 


end, anyway) I suggested we take in 
Zardoz, an apparently high-power- 
ed s-f movie playing down at the 
Jantzen Beach Tri-Cinema. 

So we tooled down to the 
renovated flood plain which is now 
covered with concrete and mobile 
homes, motels, a multi-zillion 
dollar shopping center (all waiting 
for a massive snow-melt one of 
these years to create instant disas- 
ter as the Columbia River does its 
thing) (will a 20 x 60 mobile home 
float?) in his old Belchsmog Eight 
and paid our $2.50. 

(One of the reasons I’m writing 
this review: I can charge that $2.50 
as a business expense. The Fates 
owe me that much.) 

Zardoz was written, directed and 
produced (he has no excuses) by 
John Boorman. It is a sour, smelly, 
ugly, repellent, pretentious mess. I 
mostly enjoyed its fast-moving dis- 
play of s-f furniture from our ware- 
house. The trouble is, Boorman 
managed to get dirt all over our 
things. 

The story lurches and staggers 
through much gratuitous murder, 
rape, assault, and much sanitized 
semi-nudity (all the women are 
small-breasted), simulated inter- 
course, smirky-funny scenes deal- 
ing with male erections, and magic- 
science. 

Briefly, the story is about a small 
group of immortal Eternals who 
live, 300 years from now, in force- 
field protected enclaves. They are 
the self-appointed “civilized’’ rem- 
nants of mankind who have kept 
science,' literature and art pre- 
served after a worldwide Blowup. 

The Eternals use a huge flying 
stone head called Zardoz to control 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 


147 



a group of Outside killer tribes who 
obey the massive head as a god. 
These killers have been motivated 
to kill off the ragged survivors of 
the old cities and towns. 

A killer tribe mutant (Sean Con- 
nery) stows away in Zardoz during 
one of its periodic visits to spew out 
guns and ammo and take on a 
cargo of grain. Zed (Connery) and 
his fellow mutants resent the recent 
Zardoz commands to change from 
killing the ragged remnants to en- 
slaving them for grain-growing pur- 
poses. The enclaves, called vor- 
texes, cannot grow all their own 
food. 

Zed kills the Eternal who 
operates Zardoz, leaves the stone 
god when it lands in a vortex (it is 
computer operated by remote con- 
trol), js “captured” by the easy-go- 
ing yet ruthless Eternals, is experi- 
mented upon, examined (‘What an 
interesting beast’), and in turn has 
his revolutionary anarchistic effect 
upon them and their fragile society. 

There is a self-conscious hidden 
computer used by all the vortexes 
called The Tabernacle. It dispenses 
wish-science via “magic” rings. 

There is a yen/lust among the 
Eternals for death. (For every sin 
and rule violation they are tried and 
punished by a certain amount of 
aging, but never, never allowed to 
die.) 

I could go on and on describing 
the intriguing plot elements such as 
the Eternals lack of sex drive be- 
cause of ennui and over-intellect- 
ualization, their ability (through 
the computer and developed psi- 
powers) to recreate themselyes if 
accidentally killed or damaged, 
their view of all types of human 


Outsiders as mere halfway intelli- 
gent animals . 

In the end Zed discovers the 
hidden computer, “kills” it and lets 
in his killer friends. In an orgy of 
shooting and stabbing, the killer 
tribesmen wipe out all but a 
handful of the Eternals. 

The Eternals got what they sub- 
consciously and philosophically 
wanted, you see, since they created 
the mutants as seeds of their own 
destruction. The vortexes, Zardoz 
and The Tabernacle were Evil and 
really not suited for mankind. 

Zed and his favorite Eternal 
woman escape the carnage and (in 
2001 — A Space Odyssey type stop- 
motion, time-passing sequences) 
raise a child, wither and die. Very 
symbolic and arty. 

Zardoz is clumsy, obviously deri- 
vative, dumb, exploitive, pander- 
ing, and inept. It is probably a 
prime candidate for Worst Movie 
of the Year dishonors. 

If you see it you’ll be ashamed of 
yourself a^ you walk out of the 
theater.

ARTHUR LYBRAND, C.P.A., 
EDITOR 

T here are several cases this 
month resulting from the Hart 
Amendment to the McClellan Act. 
This amendment allows U.S. Citi- 
zenship to alien life forms previous- 
ly granted temporary residency 
under the provisions of the Mc- 
Clellan Act. Several questions have 
been raised concerning the status of 
these new United States Citizens. 

Hegarv. the Commissioner, (2nd 
Cir. November 1, 21%) 

25 AFTR 2d 70-392 Affd 52 
T.C. 76. 

The intelligent inhabitants of the 
Second Planet of the Albedonian 
System, Albedonian II, are in fact 
sets of specialized unicellular 
organisms. These organisms co- 
operatively join together to form 
colonies which look remarkably 
like gigantic earthworms. During 
the late civil war on Albedonian II, 
their Ambassador to the United 
States, a colony of approximately 
10,000,000 cells called Hegar, 
asked for and received political 
asylum. This colony then entered 
the accounting profession, where 
the fantastic attention to detail pro- 
vided by 10,000,000 organisms 
(even though unicellular) focused 
on one task made the colony spec- 
tacularly successful. Accordingly, 
in the calendar year 2173, Hegar’s 
first year of being a citizen, the 
colony grossed $4,987,522. 

The colony argued that each of 


the 10,000,000 cells could file an 
individual income tax return. It 
was argued that a partnership had 
been set up to act as a conduit for 
the resulting income of the colony, 
each cell having a proportionately 
equal share. Therefore, even though 
the colony had earnings of about 
$5,000,000 of gross income, the 
proportionate share of each cell was 
under 50c which was under the 
$5,000 annual gross income tax 
exemption. (It was, indeed, fortu- 
nate for the taxpayers’ claim that 
the amount attributable to each cell 
was under $5,000 or some 
10,000,000 tax returns would have 
been required.) 

The Commissioner of the Inter- 
nal Revenue Service called in 
several extraterrestrial biologists 
who determined that the specializ- 
ed cells could not survive as indi- 
viduals for longer than twelve 
hours. 

Taxpayers’ Counsel, on the other 
hand, showed that the individual 
cells were able to select a particular 
colony and moreover could switch 
from one colony to another. It was 
also pointed out that since the cells 
reproduced by fission the members 
of the colony had no access to a 
joint return. 

The Commissioner counter- 
claimed that if the colony’s tax 
status were to be calculated on such 
an extremely micro basis, consid- 
eration should be taken of the in- 
dividual cells which had died and 
the new cells which had replaced 


150 


IF 



them. In effect, the members of the 
colony were guilty of not filing ap- 
proximately 5,000,000 estate tax 
returns (the half-life of a cell is ap- 
proximately one year). Hegar ar- 
gued that the apiount attributable 
to the average estate was less than 
the required minimum of $10,000 
for filing an estate tax return. 

Finally, the Commissioner con- 
tended that the primary motivation 
for the partnership was tax evasion. 
The taxpayers’ counsel showed that 
close cooperation among all cells 
was necessary for the performance 
of the colony duties as an account- 
ant; hence, the necessity for the 
partnership. 

The question of motivation is 
somewhat elliptical. As the Court 
said, “The crucial question is not 
whether the reason advanced by the 
taxpayers is so weighty as to have 
required the formation of a part- 
nership; rather, the question is 
whether this was the real reason 
that caused the cells to form the 
partnership.’’ The Court believed 
the colony, despite the presence of 
certain counter indications. Thus, 
the colony did not have to file any 
income or estate taxes for the year 
21 %. 

The Internal Revenue Service 
will undoubtedly appeal this de- 
cision. 

agiant Vegan Toad v. the Com- 
/V missioner, (U. S. Supreme 
Court, October 20, 21%) 

25 AFTR 2d 70-995. 


Here, the Supreme Court reiter- 
ated the principle that death must 
be conclusively proved before estate 
taxes are due. The facts of this case 
are as follows. 

The giant toads of Vega are 
known for their symbiotic relation- 
ships with their masters. They 
attach themselves onto an intelli- 
gent life form and, dog- like, follow 
that individual around until its 
death. Since the toad’s life span is 
approximately 5,000 Vegan years 
(approximately 1-1/3 as long as a 
Terrestrial year), it generally ouf- 
lives its master. While possessed of 
a master the toad is extremely pas- 
sive, but upon the demise of this in- 
dividual a strange transformation 
takes place: the toad takes on the 
personality of its master and be- 
comes privy to all of the memories 
of its master. Accordingly, for all 
intents and purposes, the personal- 
ity of the master lives on in the 
Vegan Toad. 

Such a symbiotic relationship is 
viable between Earthmen and Ve- 
gan Toads. Accordingly, Vegan 
Toads were much in demand in the 
United States as pets. Several com- 
mentators have argued that it is not 
clear that the Earthman has really 
survived the transformation. Also, 
it may not be pleasant spending ap- 
proximately 4,910 Vegan years in 
the body of a toad. However, the 
transplanted personalities inter- 
viewed by the Press expressed ad- 
miration for the new perspectives 
gained by the transmigration. One

modified toad commented, “It’s 
not so bad, especially when you 
consider the alternative.” 

Amus Tuck, a wealthy uranium 
miner, was one of the first Ameri- 
cans to have a Vegan Toad. He 
died March 19, 2196. The terms of 
his will left all of his worldly pos- 
sessions in trust to his faithful 
Vegan Toad. The decedant’s attor- 
ney contended that no estate taxes 
were due since Amus had not died, 
but continued reincarnated as the 
Vegan Toad. 

The Commissioner contended 
that: 1) there was no conclusive 
evidence that the toad was, in fact, 
the reincarnated Amus Tuck and 
that 2) even if the above were true, 
Tuck was medically and legally 
dead and, accordingly, death taxes 
were due. Finally, the Commis- 
sioner pointed out that if the de- 
fendant believed in the efficacy of 
reincarnation, no will would have 
been necessary. 

An amicus curiae brief was filed 
by Brenda Tuck and Steven Tuck 
Gross, Tuck’s grandchildren and 
only living heirs, contending that: 

1) the Vegan Toad was not Tuck; 

2) the will was invalid due to in- 
sanity. 

The contention of the brief was that 
Tuck had indeed died intestate 
and, accordingly, the grandchil- 
dren were entitled to the remainder 
of the estate after payment of estate 
taxes. 

The Supreme Court slashed 
through this Gordian knot after a 


lengthy interview with the Vegan 
Toad plus the sworn testimony of 
20 of Tuck’s closest friends who 
claimed that the Vegan Toad was 
indeed Tuck. The Court ruled that 
Tuck continued to exist as the 
Vegan Toad.

Commissioner, (2nd Cir. No- 
vember 28, 21%) 

25 AFTR 2d 70-1291 Rev’d 52 T. 
C. 439. 

The final case this month in- 
volves complications resulting from 
extraterrestrial marital customs. 
This case also indicates that bio- 
logical differences are not necessary 
to test the boundaries of the U.S. 
Tax Code; sociological differences 
are quite sufficient. 

Lucius Stud, a humanoid native 
of Egret, the largest country in the 
fifth planet of Balmour, immi- 
grated to the United States on 
February 15, 2195. He brought 
with him all 534 of his wives. Under 
Egret custom, Stud could marry up 
to 1001 wives. This custom was due 
to the ratio of males to females on 
Egret. 

Having duly received permission 
from the Grand Snark of Egret, he 
proceeded to marry three U.S. Citi- 
zens by December 31, 21%. Per- 
suant to the Hart Amendment, he 
claimed U.S. citizenship for all 534 
of his other wives as well as for 
himself. For the year then ended, 
Stud directed each of his wives to 
fill out a joint return. This is not 


152 


IF 



unusual as wives were the principle 
breadwinners on Egret, men spend- 
ing their time on weighty philo- 
sophical discussions. 

Stud’s wives contended that each 
of the 537 marriages was legally 
binding due to the Bently treaty 
between the United States and 
Egret allowing reciprocal legality 
for the customs of each country. 
The Commissioner argued that if 
537 joint returns were filed, Stud 
would be allowed to be a deduction 
on each return, thus violating the 
general rule that one can not be a 
deduction on more than one return. 
Moreover, if taxpayers in general 
were allowed multiple marriages, 
the administration of joint returns 
would become an administrative 
nightmare. 

This argument was unsuccessful. 
The Court accused the Commis- 
sioner of using colorful hyperbole 
and ruled that all of Stud’s wives 
were entitled to the joint return, 
but only one of them could deduct 
for Stud. 

D ue to the poor showing of 
the Commissioner in this 
month’s cases, it appears that legis- 
lative clarifications will be neces- 
sary to close the gigantic loopholes 
in the fabric of the U.S. tax legisla- 
tion due to the Hart Amendment. 

Next month we will explore tax 
planning techniques for partner- 
ships between Homosapien and 
naturalized extraterrestrial U.S. 
Citizens.

Even the Technarch of the Seven Worlds 
should not lightly disturb the meditations 
of a Philosopher of the Hintas School! 


EGANTEI 
AND THE 
SAGE 


JOHN C. WHITE 



rriHE technarch of the Seven 
| Worlds, Yang Egantei Mei 
Chant Ajal Dunia, was at peace 
with himself. The Hintas would 
have no choice but to accede to this 
somewhat forceful request that they 
assign a full philosopher to him 
until the threat of Togger A 137 was 
past. Things had proceeded so well 
that he was free to pass the re- 
mainder of his work day relaxing 
amid the treasures of art which he 
had collected using the wealth of all 
the Seven Worlds. The philosopher 
would arrive soon and there was 
hope that Togger would come no 
closer to completing his boast than 
talk. The treasure would be safe 


and Egantei could be assured of the 
tranquility of his Gallery as an 
eternal refuge from the tension of 
governing. 

The bells suspended on the 
curled toes of Egantei’s slippers 
woven of Amethyst and Beryl 
jingled in the sudden halt of his 
body confronted by his Major 
Donio. The soft removed voice of 
Egantei met Dolch politely, the ser- 
vant was a wonder, not once in the 
years of his service had the Tech- 
narch found a trace of hair on the 
man or the faintest body odor. 

“Yes, Dolch.” 

The major domo approached to 
within three feet and turned his 


154 




head ninety degrees from the Tech- 
narch that his breath be cast away 
from his employer. 

“The philosopher has arrived 
Revered One.” 

Egantei nodded acknowledg- 
ment. “Ah, you see Dolch. Even 
the Hintas must hear the wish of 
the Technarch of Seven Worlds.’’ 

Dolch bowed, the barest tension 
flickered in the expanse of his fore- 
head leading on into the whiteness 
of his shaven head. “Though it 
seems true. Revered One, there are 
few willing to threaten the Hintas.” 

“I shall be most careful Dolch. 
Where have you sent this philoso- 
pher? There is little need to affront 
him further by tardiness.” 

Dolch’s voice caught in his 
throat. “Ruh, R . Revered One, 
I have served long and am not un- 
skilled in dealing with guests some- 
thing less than delicate, but this 
one is, is — ” 

“Come to the point Dolch. The 
guest is intractible but where have 
you deposited him?” 

Dolch fairly croaked. “The 
Gallery.” 

The face of the Technarch 
whitened with anger. He breathed 
deeply, forcing the emotion from 
him. It was neither seemly nor 
healthy to succumb to such a crude 
useless thing as anger. Ultimately 
the Technarch regained the peace 
which was his natural state. His 
hands ceased trembling. Dolch had 
disappeared quite diplomatically 
and Egantei walked swiftly toward 
the Gallery. 

When he had reached the moon 
circle which was the entrance 
Egantei slowed once again, allowed 
his eyes to caress the silver lustre of 


the circle. It would have pleased 
him to forget the philosopher and 
devote the proper time to fully 
appreciating the intricate beauty of 
the moon circle. Though glowing as 
if smoothly polished the entire 
frame was etched in the trails left 
by the metal worms of Ddavo. Thru 
some mystery the worms moved in 
patterns preset by their nucleic 
structure. Placed by an artist, such 
a thing as the moon circle could be 
produced. Egantei passed thru the 
circle into the Gallery having nearly 
forgotten that this time he came not 
to fete his senses but on business. 

Inside the Gallery he beheld a 
spindly runt of a beggar dressed in 
ragged clothing bent over one of the 
niches in the far wall. Egantei 
moved with grace beneath the folds 
of his gown across the space be- 
tween. The perfection of the cera- 
mic glazed floor, composed of 
333,333,333 individual tiles meshed 
into the -legend of Lian Mabat and 
his mischievious brother Lian Tua 
held the Technarch’s eyes until he 
had nearly reached the shabby 
figure. 

The beggar ~ turned to face 
Egantei and at the moment that 
comprehension settled on the Tech- 
narch his bells jangled; his rings 
tarnished; and the music of the 
cosmic symphony missed not one 
note but two. In the knobby 
unwashed hands was the single 
Ariadan Soul Piece ever worked to 
completion. And worse, the hands 
were shaking, the treasure seemed 
about to fall. 

“P-please, honored guest, b-be 
careful, the p-piece is priceless.” 

The dirt grimed face bent to look 
in disbelief at the metal spire in his 


155 



visibly quivering hands. Slowly, 
jerkily the piece was returned to 
rest solidly. The Technarch began 
to breathe, color returned to his 
face and when he stepped toward 
the Hintas philosopher there was a 
smile on his face. A smile on his 
face and spite in his heart. The 
Technarch ruled his life to the love 
of beauty. Something in the 
philosopher grated against this de- 
votion but Egantei had an end to 
attain. 

“Honored Sage, forgive my 
greeting but the Gallery is my re- 
treat from the trouble of ruling the 
Seven Worlds. I am Yang Egantei 
Mei Chant Ajal Dunia, the proper 
appelation is Egantei.” The Tech- 
narch smoothed the red stone set in 
one of his many rings. The shabby 
runt brushed his smudged palm 
down the front of an already soiled 
tunic. 

“1 am called Dry Wine.” 

“It is an honor to meet with such 
a revered instructor of the Hintas 
thought. Of respect for the value of 
your time Revered Sage I shall at- 
tempt to explain quite briefly my 
reason for appealing to the 
School.” Dry Wine twisted his head 
peering beneath his armpit at a 
porcelain vase perched on a 
pedestal behind him. Egantei con- 
tinued. “It has been my misfortune 
that lately a certain Togger A 137 
has made the public boast that he 
will steal every treasure within this 
room. In his words, from beneath 
my polished nose. Through my 
investigations I have learned that 
this boast could be far from idle. 
None of the leading protection 
agencies is willing to undertake the 
commission of guarding the room. 


It seems that this Togger is consid- 
ered the most skilled thief who has 
ever lived.” 

Apparently oblivious to Egantei, 
Dry Wine crawled on hands and 
knees over the tile floor. His short 
tunic was drawn up over the 
shiveled curve of his buttocks pre- 
sented square to the Technarch. 

“I have of course exhausted every 
possible avenue in order to assure 
the safety of the collection. The 
Hintas are my last resort. I hope 
that my somewhat forceful attitude 
in this matter is understandable.” 

Dry Wine lifted his soiled tunic 
and in a physical contortion 
patently impossible disappeared 
between his own legs. He emerged a 
second later crushing vehemently 
some real or imagined parasite 
between his thumb and forefinger. 
With a last careful examination of 
his fingertip he turned to the 
Technarch. 

“Technarch Egantei, the meth- 
ods of the Hintas may perhaps 
seem less than rational to those 
uninitiated in the inner mystery.” 
The runt’s manner was openly inso- 
lent, but the Technarch would 
allow nothing to interfere with his 
desire to protect his treasure. The 
philosopher’s voice squeaked on. 
“It would be much worse than if 
you had not appealed to the School 
should you choose to interrupt the 
forces which will be set in motion.” 

The Technarch bowed gracious- 
ly. “I am vaguely familiar with 
certain rather . odd matters 
concerning the Hintas. Though its 
techniques are somewhat unusual 
the School is noted for its unmarred 
record in successfully completing 
any task which it undertakes. Be 


156 


IF 



assured that both I and the wealth 
of the Seven Worlds are at your ser- 
vice.” Another and even more gra- 
cious bow and the Technarch con- 
tinued. ‘‘Perhaps you would wish 
my engineer to show you the means 
by which I have endeavored to 
protect this room and it’s 
contents.” 

The philosopher scratched his 
inner thigh. “It is not necessary. 
There will, however, be some minor 
expense incurred.” 

Egantei pulled an engraved sig- 
net from his index finger and laid it 
on a marble table. Quite noticeably 
he stepped away from the table as 
Dry Wine approached to take the 
ring. He seemed almost not to 
notice the philosopher as he spoke. 
“The ring will serve as currency 
anywhere in the Galaxy. The 
wealth of the seven worlds is well 
appreciated.” 

Dry Wine scrabbled forward, 
still scratching his thigh. He ig- 
nored the warning of the wealth of 
the Technarch. ‘T shall send in- 
structions within five days.” Push- 
ing the ring onto his thumb he 
walked with dignity through the 
moon circle. 


E gantei stood for a few mo- 
ments. His hands quivered and 
tiny spasms clenched at the corners 
of his mouth. 

“Dolch!!!” 

The shaven aide was immediately 
in the Gallery. He was unmoved by 
the turmoil of the Technarch, stood 
silently while his. master fumed. 

“Follow him Dolch. He’s not to 
leave your sight. I don’t trust the 
Hintas, and as you say, perhaps I 


was less than submissive in request- 
ing their help.” 

Dolch turned to leave. The 
spasms of anger and fear did not 
lessen in Egantei. Even in his re- 
treat, surrounded by the beauty of 
a Universe, the fear of losing that 
which gave him peace left him no 
longer safe from the agonies of the 
world. His words erupted in tor- 
ture, cut Dolch off before he had 
left the room. 

“Dolch, prepare a walker. I shall 
go myself. See that it is bathed and 
dressed well. Attend to me yourself, 
I’ll have no engineers about my 
body.” 

“Yes, revered one.” 

Still the turbulence was on 
Egantei. Mixed within the fear of 
losing his treasure was now the 
anticipation of walking in the ugli- 
ness of the world outside. His cloth- 
ing had grown damp with sweat 
and as he walked to the transfer 
chamber it was an act of will not to 
turn aside to bathe and dress. 
Egantei thumbed the door panel 
and was inside. 

The walker was ready, slumped 
senseless in the left hand chair. 
Egantei had used the walkers be- 
fore but had never had the courage 
to leave his citadel. He studied the 
smooth skin, detected not the faint- 
est odor. He fancied a slight per- 
fume rose from the artificial body. 
Dolch led him to the right hand 
chair and began fixing the bands 
about his skull. In moments it was 
done. Sweat ran in streams beneath 
the robe of the Technarch but in 
spite of centuries of seclusion there 
had never been such a threat to his 
own personal dominion as that 
posed by Togger A 137. Silently he 


EGANTEI AND THE SAGE 


157 



cursed them; first the master thief 
and then the philosopher. The 
warmth of the curse calmed him 
enough to speak. 

“Now Dolch.’’ 

Dolch’s naked hands worked the 
console and Egantei sensed only a 
momentary fuzziness. When his 
vision cleared he was inside the 
walker. Quickly he checked the cir- 
cuitry; vision, locomotion. All the 
senses were in order. Egantei stood. 
He was captured in the slack life- 
lessness of his own body slumped in 
the right hand chair. From the look 
of it he was due for a session with 
the Med Team. In the twenty years 
since his last session the body had 
begun to go to fat. He thought too 
that perhaps the kidneys were 
giving out. Without a word to 
Dolch, Egantei left the transfer 
chamber. Enough concentration 
was needed to control the walker 
that the Technarch was partially re- 
lieved of his fear but it came to him 
again as he reached the side exit 
through which the philosopher had 
departed. 

Green light washed into the cells 
of the walker. Odors of dust and 
human motion loaded the circuits 
which channeled them to his brain. 
Egantei forced the waves away from 
him, pierced through the cloud of 
them. Just outside the gate he could 
see the scrawny philpsopher 
squatting to speak with a child 
whose mother studied the schedule 
of a tube, waiting for the computer 
to clear her route. Egantei gathered 
in his mind the tune of the singing 
sands and the symetry of the soul 
piece as guards against the world 
about him. In front of the gate the 
mother gathered her child’s hand 


and they were gone inside the tube. 
The philosopher turned and with 
Egantei in the act of opening the 
gate they were face to face. With 
the poised deception of a ruler 
Egantei ignored the philosopher 
but as he was passing the thin voice 
of Dry Wine accosted him. 

“Do you work for the one who 
styles himself the ruler of seven 
worlds?” 

This Egantei could not ignore. 
Barely mastering indignation he 
questioned as would a loyal em- 
ployee. 

“You speak of the Revered One, 
Yang Egantei Mei Chant Ajal 
Dunia?” 

“That’s him, old tepid tea and 
pink lace, says he rules seven 
worlds but shuts himself away 
inside a citadel of beauty and 
order.” 

In the chair Egantei’s body flush- 
ed. On the street he said. 

“Who are you sir?” 

Dry Wine smiled. "You sir are 
nearly as stupid as old pinky. As 
long as you intend to follow me why 
don’t we go together. Save both of 
us a lot of trouble.” 

The philosopher was right. Of 
course it was obvious that the 
walker was to follow the sage. The 
strangeness of controlling the 
walker and the weight of the world 
about him had dulled Egantei’s 
mind. 

“Very well. I hope you under- 
stand my employer’s concern.” 

Dry Wine punched his own 
priority on the tube and its door 
slid open. As they entered he 
spoke. 

“Better perhaps than the Tech- 
narch himself.” 


158 


IF 



The pressure in the tube pinned 
them to the wall of their cylinder 
for the space of a moment and the 
door opened. The green light 
flooded them once again. They 
were in the deep, that part of the 
city in which only a fool walked, 
even in daylight. Dry Wine 
scrabbled off in his peculiar stride 
apparently uncaring as to whether 
Egantei followed or not. 

Sweat poured from the body in 
the chair. It was by force of will 
that Egantei kept himself inside the 
walker. The people in the deep 
smelled. It had been an oversight to 
take a walker whose olfactory 
sensors were connected. Egantei 
moved in a gray tunnel, seeing only 
the beggar sage who led him. 
Hastily he caught up with Dry 
Wine. His voice was faint. 

“Where are we going?” 

“To protect your lord’s treasure. 
The Hintas are always true to their 
word. Here, this is the place. If we 
are lucky we will find your thief in 
here.” 

Egantei allowed himself to take 
in for a second the smoke-clouded 
windows, cracked paint and sour 
odor. The door closed behind them 
and they were inside the room. The 
sweet decay of chandu was in the 
air. Users lay on the floor where 
they fell. Their bodies twitched 
occasionally, nervous systems nearly 
burned out, they had neither the 
money nor the desire for the med 
session which might renew them. A 
thick man with gray dirty skin 
stood behind a counter. A bowl of 
antiseptic with a yellow cloth swab 
floating in it was the only decora- 
tion of the counter. Three pneu- 
matic injectors hung on the wall 


above it. Two tubes led from each, 
one to the air compressor and an- 
other to some sense-destroying 
drug. That such a place, flagrantly 
illegal could exist in his capitol city 
enraged Egantei. Whether the 
philosopher guessed his thought or 
through some gift could read it 
even in the face of the walker 
Egantei did not know. 

“It would be unwise of your em- 
ployer to take action against Mar 
here. Many choose to leave the 
world. These narcotics shouldn’t 
bother old pinky; they are neither 
as expensive nor as subtle as the 
spell of the Ariadan soul piece but 
of similar function.” 

The remarks fluttered feebly at 
the thickening wall which Egantei 
drew about him. The philosopher 
pointed to a table in the shadows. 
As they neared it, the odor of def- 
fecation rolled out from an open 
door frame. Gorge rose in the body 
which was safe in the chair. Egantei 
nearly succeeded in masking the 
odor with the fragrance of orchids 
which he held inside him. The man 
at the table was old. His body was 
well cared for. Egantei guessed him 
to be at least two hundred, but 
younger than himself. They sat in 
plastic chairs, chairs covered with 
the oily stain of chandu smoke. The 
man viewed them with empty eyes. 
His face was as passionless as his 
voice. 

“Good day philosopher. Though 
it is good to see you old friend I 
must guess that you are the agent 
by which our foppish ruler attempts 
to save his treasure.” 

Dry Wine inclined his bead. “I 
would not hide this from you Gog. 
The commission has been forced on 


EGANTEI AND THE SAGE 


159 



us and I am the one who must 
execute it.” 

Blood rushed through the body 
in the chair. Egantei forced seeing 
so that he would know the face of 
the thief. In the clarity of vision 
Togger A 137 was revealed as a 
creature of subtlety. Sudden fear 
took Egantei, fear that he had put 
himself and his hope into hands 
which would betray him. His 
thoughts, his fears clung to him. 
He fought against them and the 
revulsion arising from the odors 
wafting through the door to hear 
the conversation. 

Togger smiled, a thinness 
against his face. 

“Well, philosopher, it will be 
even more of a challenge than I had 
hoped for.” As though he had just 
noticed Egantei, Togger studied 
the voided face of the walker. 
Satisfied, he returned his attention 
to Dry Wine. “If you would excuse 
me for a second my friend I have a 
small business to attend to.” 

The thief rose, became part of 
the grayness which held the world 
away from Egantei. The Technarch 
was immersed in his fears of be- 
trayal. Of all the things which were 
certain in the world the most cer- 
tain was a contract taken by the 
Hintas. The School did not deal in 
deception. But Egantei was 
plagued by the fact that this was 
not a contract undertaken volun- 
tarily; he had forced it on the 
.School. Even the Hintas might 
betray him under such circum- 
stances. Worse, the philosopher 
was a friend of the thief. 

as egantei thought he became 
aware of an uncomfortable 


wetness spreading down his side. 
The flow of it ran beneath his cloth- 
ing. An acrid smell rose to his nos- 
trils as the Technarch turned the 
walker’s head. 

Togger had lowered his trousers 
and as the head came about the 
thief switched his elevation and uri- 
nated square in the blank face. 
Egantei did not hear what he said, 
his mind was bolted back into the 
body of his birth. 

Purple apoplexy bloated his face, 
thick veins throbbed through his 
neck. The muscles of his body 
twisted in spasms confined by the 
leather straps which Dolch had 
fastened. The odor and warmth 
coalesced in horror and outrage. 
Murder was in the heart and soul of 
Egantei. He did not even feel the 
needle which Dolch slid beneath his 
skin. The Technarch fought the 
drug as some material foe. His 
anger, the core of half-formed re- 
venge fermented within him as 
lethargy took even his mind. The 
Technarch’s last slow thought was 
of pride. It had been wise of him to 
take a walker; the thought had 
crossed his mind to go himself. If 
he had it would be his flesh and not 
that of the walker which was fouled 
beyond cleansing. 

Egantei opened his eyes. The 
comfort of his bed chamber was 
like a womb around him, soothing 
the nerves which had been strained 
to exhaustion. For a moment he 
was a babe, seeing only the wonder 
of light. A thought still red with the 
passion of hate fought to reach the 
surface of his mind. Egantei 
reached for it. Rage, cold and deep 
quivered through him. The sleep, 
however, had refreshed him. His 


160 


IF 



voice was measured and toneless as 
he called for his servant. 

“Dolch.” 

Hairless, silent, Dolch appeared. 

“Yes, Revered One!” 

Egantei raised his head, calmed 
himself by straying into the delicate 
etchings of a lythian cardograph 
covering the far wall of his bed- 
chamber. The symmetry of it was 
cool water, the color soothing 
grace. The fact of it was a reminder 
that even his revenge must be 
tempered with caution lest he lose 
his treasure, his life. 

“Has there been word from the 
philosopher?” 

“No word Revered One, but a re- 
port from one whom 1 sent to 
follow.” 

Egantei sighed. If he could not 
trust himself, Dolch was infallible. 

“What was the report?” 

Guessing that the Technarch 
would rather hear than read the 
paper Dolch slipped it from his 
sleeve and began to read aloud. 

“First sight of the Hintas philos- 
opher was in the deep where he was 
walking in the company of the 
master thief Togger A137. Shortly 
the philosopher shook hands with 
his companion and they parted on 
apparently good terms. The next 
action of consequence was the entry 
of a Com Station where the subject 
sent two messages.” 

Dolch bowed, “Copies of the two 
messages were included. The first 
carries neither a name nor an 
address. 

To: Tepid Tea and Pink Lace 

From: Dry Wine 

Respected sir; I hope that you do 
not hold me responsible for the 
actions of another. I could not 


know that Tog held walkers in such 
loathing. These things aside the 
safety of your treasure is now within 
your own personal control. If you 
wish to complete the contract have 
the feast of 127 dishes prepared by 
the hand of Alonjian Sidap lain on 
a plain blue cloth of coarse weave. 
The feast must be laid on the cloth 
within the Gallery. Provide three 
couches molded of silver and up- 
holstered in the same cloth as that 
upon which the feast is laid. The 
other embellishments I leave to 
your own artistic discernment. 
Your presence is mandatory. 
Should you leave or behave in a 
manner which is offensive to our 
guest your treasure could be lost. 
The feast is to be set on the third 
day after you have received this 
message. The time is to be exactly 
one hour from 1800 hours to 1900 
hours. Should you leave before the 
hour is done or attempt in any way 
to discover the identity of our guest 
you have voided the contract.” 
Dolch paused to show the mes- 
sage done. “I had assumed the 
message was for you Revered One, 
but it seemed unlikely addressed in 
such a way. The second message, 
though it has an address is even 
more cryptic.” 

To: My most perfect friend 
From: Your humble philosopher 
The favor I ask I have asked be- 
fore. The gain we make is more 
than real. In the light of a marsh 
fire, oily and slick, I pull a bOuquef 
of rotten carrots. We meet in your 
palace ‘at 1600 hours three days 
from the day you receive this.” 
“And that is the message 
Revered One.” 

Egantei took the paper, read it 


EGANTEI AND THE SAGE 


161 



only once again; silently; and re- 
turned it to Dolch. His decision was 
made. Revenge would wait until it 
was expedient. 

“When did you receive this 
Dolch?” 

“It is 1200 of the third day 
Revered One. Should you choose to 
go through with it -the arrange- 
ments have been made.” 

Egantei felt the release of defeat 
course through him. Let what 
would be; be. 

“I am in retirement Dolch. I will 
see no one but yourself. Make the 
preparations and any others which 
will insure the safety of the Gallery. 
Do not interfere with the Hintas.” 

Dolch padded silently from the 
bedchamber and the Technarch 
was left alone to gather what peace 
he could before the confrontation. 
Egantei dressed himself and as the 
clean cloth settled next to his body 
peace left him. A drawing sort of 
spell called to him from the 
Gallery. With the spell was the 
apprehension that he might never 
behold his treasure again. His foot- 
steps were hurried and when at last 
he reached the gallery a thin film of 
perspiration dampened his fore- 
head. He paused before the moon 
circle drinking its beauty with a 
desperate need. The passion did 
not leave him, was not drawn from 
his soul by the delicate etchings. He 
moved inside the Gallery, ignoring 
the flurries of Alonjian Sidap as the 
Chef prepared the feast. 

The sweat dried on his forehead, 
blood slowed in his veins, his hands 
grew warm where they had been 
cold with tension. Egantei became 
lost in the slow river of beauty 
which caught him. Togger A 137, 


even the philsopher melted into the 
line and art of his treasure. With 
only half an hour remaining 
Egantei had recaptured his 
tranquility. He began to adjust the 
serving dishes laid for the feast. 
The bird piping of Alonjian cas- 
caded in trills of horror. 

“No, it is not so. The feast, it is 
not to be profaned, the kero- 
pok ...” The chef waved a bowl of 
crisp red flakes at the Technarch in 
flurries of exasperation. “The kero- 
pok must be . .” With a flourish 
Alonjian resettled the dish. 
“here!!” Arms crossed, the bird- 
like Alonjian challenged Egantei 
but the Technarch was gentle. He 
understood the temperament of 
such an artiste as Alonjian Sidap. 

“My apologies She’ Sidap, one is 
unnerved by the delicate nuances 
which fill the air. One i£ over- 
whelmed by anticipation. If it 
would not be an overly stated addi- 
tion, I offer the use of any of the 
pieces within the Gallery . .” And 
for thirty minutes the Technarch 
and the cook discussed the value of 
each of the treasures as the one 
most likely to echo the flavor of the 
feast of one hundred and twenty- 
seven dishes. When at last it came 
to be 1800 hours they were fairly in 
raptures of esthetic joy. A chime 
chimed and Egantei excused him- 
self to finish the odious business of 
an entire meal with the philosopher 
Dry Wine. Alonjian exited quietly 
and the Technarch tinkled his way 
to the moon circle. 

T he philosopher did not wait to 
be greeted by the Technarch 
but strolled casually into the 
Gallery. Egantei ducked his head 


162 


IF 



in a small bow preparatory to 
speech but when he raised his head 
the words were choked on the gorge 
which rose in his throat. Egantei 
turned away from his guests. The 
philosopher seemed not to notice 
but began speaking as though sur- 
rounded by friends of long 
acquaintance. 

“Ah Revered Technarch, I am 
glad that in only one hour my com- 
mission will have been successfully 
completed. Allow me to introduce 
my companion.” Dry Wine’s every 
move was an overly exaggerated 
etiquette that went unappreciated, 
for Egantei remained with his back 
turned. The Technarch hardly 
heard the philosopher as he 
struggled with his stomach as it 
strove to empty itself. 

"Hmenh, may I present the 
Technarch of the Seven Worlds, 
Yang Egantei Mei Chant Ajal 
Dunia. As one of my oldest and 
dearest friends I could not help but 
think ...” 

The Technarch won for the mo- 
ment over the rebellion of his 
stomach. He seemed for a second 
about to leave the Gallery but ap- 
praising the treasures turned to join 
his guests. As the human body has 
no memory for pain, the absolute 
revulsion Egantei felt for the guest, 
Hmenh, seemed unreal now that 
the sight of such ugliness was re- 
moved. 

“. that you and the Tech- 
narch would both profit from your 
meeting.” 

Seeing Egantei about to return. 
Dry Wine assumed to the hilt his 
role of overly officious friend per- 
forming introductions. He rose 
from his couch, deftly slipping to 


the Technarch’s side in such a way 
that Egantei could no longer avoid 
the spectre of Hmenh piled like a 
heap of garbage on the silver- 
wrought divan. “And,” Dry Wine 
continued, “Egantei, I am sure 
that it is more than past time that 
you met Hmenh; there are few who 
can "claim the friendship of the 
ugliest man in the Galaxy.” 

Stunned nearly senseless Egantei 
allowed himself to be maneuvered 
to his own divan. He was bound in 
the spell of ugliness; the twisted 
limbs, begrimed body, soiled cloth- 
ing, fetid breath which blotted out 
the spice odor of the feast. The 
philosopher seemed unaware of the 
Technarch’s distress and expound- 
ed continuously on the beauty of 
the treasures within the gallery. 
Egantei became enmeshed in the 
boneless half of Hmenh’s face 
which hung down over his neck 
spreading a distorted mask of 
mouth and nose as a puddle of 
rotting offal on the man’s chest. 

“And this, Hmenh, this is the 
ultimate in art, an Ariadan soul 
sculpture completed at the exact 
moment of his death by . .” 
Cancerous lessions covered the 
face, oozing a slow drainage of pus 
even into the eyes of Hmenh. 

“. what could compare with 
the harmonious subtilities of the 
Alac Urn containing precisely 
1 1 ,000 grains of sand taken from 
the singing beach of . .” 

The ugliest man in the Galaxy 
leaned forward, his ulcerous fingers 
emptied a bowl of mushy pudding 
onto the blue cloth. Groping 
blindly over the table the fingers 
filled the bowl with flakey keropok, 
egglike elor, soupy ementhal, and 


EGANTEI AND THE SAGE 


163 



on and on until the bowl was a heap 
of garbage. 

. is many millenia old, the 
last complete of its kind, truly ex- 
quisite.” 

Egantei could not move, could 
not turn his head. 

The nerves within the wretched 
body of Hmenh were twisted on 
themselves. His body began to 
lurch in spasms, his near-fingerless 
hands poked food at his mouth but 
was almost infallibly thrown aside. 
Soon the food covered his face in 
gooey wads. 

Dry Wine moved to his friend’s 
side, selected the choicest morsels 
from the feast, poising his hand 
over the black decaying cavern of 
Hmenh’s mouth. He seemed an 
emaciated mouse dropping flies to 
a toad which has been stepped on. 

Egantei recovered suddenly from 
his trance, bent double over the 
edge of his divan and wretched the 
last globules of every meal he had 
ever eaten. His own vomit lay over 
the 333,333,333 tiled floor, cover- 
ing the half smile of the ceramic 
hero Lian Tua. The odor and color 
of half digested food seemed to 
have a peculiar fascination to the 
Technarch. Weak exhileration 
cleared his vision to a different see- 
ing than he could remember. The 
beauty of the floor was destroyed by 
the bile which had been in him. 
Egantei raised his eyes to the soul, 
piece which was in the center of the 
feast. As the floor, the beauty of the 
worked metal was no longer pure. 
It was flawed by the ugliness of 
Hmenh, and by the odor which rose 
from the vomit. Wherever the 
Technarch turned his head there 
was the curious blending of beauty 


and ugliness. Never again could he 
divide his perceptions to behold the 
one half without seeing within it the 
ugliness which made it whole. 

Egantei’s face was pale as he 
spoke to the philosopher. ‘‘Your 
contract is completed philosopher.” 
Not yet recovered the Technarch 
managed a weak sort of stagger 
which carried him out of the room. 

When he had gone Hmenh re- 
covered miraculously from the ner- 
vous spasms. The smile on his 
lipless mouth was an ugly match to 
that of Dry Wine. ‘‘Well, my 
friend, what have you accomplished 
this time?” 

Dry Wine did not answer, he sat 
silently enjoying the feel of a 
mission nicely completed. As a 
student of balance he had accom- 
plished much. 

The Technarch who had blinded 
himself in his love of beauty had be- 
held ugliness. It would be difficult 
for him to view anything now with- 
out the shade of ugliness in it. 

Togger A 137 would be more than 
satisfied that the treasure had been 
stolen in such a way that it could 
never be regained. 

Dry Wine would see that Hmenh 
received a share of wealth; it 
seemed likely the Technarch would 
pay for the privilege of not renew- 
ing their acquaintance. 

Perhaps most importantly the 
Tyranny of the Seven Worlds would 
from this day be weighted by the 
wisdom of the Hintas School. 

Dry Wine spoke aloud then, 
from the depths of his memory. 
“Hmenh, some philosopher some- 
where nearly approached truth 
when he said: ‘There’s more than 
one way to skin a cat’.” •

W e all know the story of the 
folks from Barden: how their 
first spacecraft landed in the park- 
ing lot of a bowling alley in Akron, 
Ohio and caused a riot; how we be- 
came used to their looks and they 
became used to ours (we all know 
many of the hundreds of trite, 
amusing anecdotes and dirty jokes 
told by members of each race about 
the other’s appearance and be- 
havior); how the Bardenians set up 


camp on Earth and started showing 
and teaching Earth people some of 
the things they knew; how our 
planet prospered and how we all 
grew as individuals because of what 
the Bardenians brought us. There 
is no need for a reiteration. 

However, when the Bardenians 
left us suddenly one July afternoon, 
the human race was thrown into 
such a panic that the facts concern- 
ing the Bardenians’ departure have 


become obscured. Vicious rumors 
were spread. People accused the 
Bardenians of everything from 
heresy to the using of the blood of 
Christian children as a condiment. 
Other groups preached that the 
Bardenians were God, or Buddha, 
or Jesus Christ resurrected. One 
small cult in Georgia insisted that 
the Bardenians were really Russian 
Communists. It is even said that a 
religion sprang up in India which 
taught that the Bardenians did not 
exist and in fact never had. But this 
is hearsay. 

Only recently have the facts con- 
cerning the Bardenians’ departure 
been uncovered and verified. Here- 
with follows the true account of 
how and why the Bardenians left 
us. Also included are compilations 
of data concerning the Bardenians 
as a people and some of their con- 
tributions.

brought to us by the Bar- 
denians:

Earth’s crust 

3. More efficient treatment of sew-

from sea-water

T he Bardenians had given us 
new hope for our planet. We 
had been on the edge of political 
and ecological catastrophe when 
they had first arrived. An historic 
marker (the banner the Bardenians 
planted immediately upon the land- 
ing of their first expedition) still 
stands in front of the now-famous 
bowling alley in Akron. 

It was quite a remarkable coin- 
cidence that the Bardenians came 
along when they did. (In Bardenian 
terms, a random factor of immense 


166 


IF 



proportion and consequence.) Hu- 
manity was making preparations to 
cut its own throat, and no Earthly 
force was able to prevent the 
suicide. Then the Bardenians show- 
ed up, took one look at our planet, 
and single-handedly fixed things up 
for us. They brought us from the 
brink of disaster to the beginnings 
of renewed prosperity in a matter of 
months. When asked by national 
leaders why they helped us so un- 
selfishly, a Bardenian spokesman 
answered, “Wouldn’t you do the 
same for a backward culture? Isn’t 
that what you’re doing already with 
your ‘underdeveloped’ countries?’’ 
In the words of H. J. Lummo- 
lopo, a leading Bardenian econo- 
mist and philosopher: “Nobody 
does anything for its own sake. 
What we’re trying to do is show you 
some Bardenian technology and a 
little Bardenian culture. We have 
quite a lot to gain economically, 
scientifically, and culturally — even 
artistically — from you.” 

(Bardenians had always been 
fond, for some reason, of the Mon- 
kees, Igor Stravinsky, Bela Bartok, 
Salvadore Dali, and the films of W. 
C. Fields.) 

“Quite frankly, you are an in- 
vestment to us, just as we are one to 
you.”

S ome breakthroughs in the social 
sciences we learned from the 
people of Barden: 


1 . Synectic memory storage 

2. Telepathic contact between some 
members of certain gene pools 

3. The reaching of nirvana by one 
hundred and ninety humans 

4. Six previously un-thought-of 
sexual positions 

5. Limited verbal communication 
with other mammals 

6. An end to “dirty politics” 

7. A definition of the terms “broth- 
erhood” and “humanity” 

8. An end to all war, and peace 
with honor

A selection of physical descrip- 
tions of the people of Barden: 

1. “Imagine a bagpipe with legs.” 

2. “Jesus, are they ugly. They’ve 
got a whole mess of unjointed 
arms — six or eight, I think! — 
coming right out of the top of 
their bodies. And their bodies 
look like big fat wineskins. And 
they’ve got four short, stubby 
legs with human-looking feet. 
They shine like they’ve got a 
thick coating of grease all over 
them.” 

3. "Imagine an inflated bowling 
ball with two tumors on the bot- 
tom and a bunch of branches 
stuck in the top.” 

4. “Sure I can describe them. Take 
a gigantic jello mold using three 
gallons of mixed fruit gelatin, 
right? Cut off four fetus feet and 
balance the jello on top of them. 
Then top the whole mess off

with a bunch of flutes stuck in at 
random.” 

5. ‘‘They’re beautiful, really they 
are.” 

6. ‘‘An overgrown eggplant, paint- 
ed reddish-purple, with bamboo 
growing where the hair should 
be and clumps of toes on the 
bottom.” 

7. “They look like my cousin Har- 
riet. Christ, is she ugly.” 

8. “You ever seen how they have 
sex? They’ve got two of every- 
thing that counts, and four go- 
nads. Listen, 1 can give you a 
whole big envelope full of eight- 
by-ten glossies for only ten 
bucks.”

T he Bardenians worked with us 
tirelessly for three years. In that 
time, ten Bardenian space missions 
had been sent to Earth. For three 
years they served as our teachers; 
they showed us our mistakes, point- 
ed out untapped resources, set up 
trade negotiations, and showed us 
their own culture. They became a 
father-figure to much of humanity. 

And then, spontaneously (to 
Earthmen), the Bardenians decided 
to leave, perhaps not forever, but, 
in Lummolopo’s words, “for at 
least two or three hundred of your 
years — certainly long enough for 
you to ruin yourselves again.” 

It was Lummolopo who made the 
now-famous announcement of de- 
parture. He called a news con- 


ference and had his image and his 
words broadcast all over the planet.

A condensed outline of Bar- 
denian thought: 

1 . You are constantly being judged 
by yourself and by others 

2. All behavior should be enjoyed 

3. All behavior, including neurotic 
and psychotic behavior, is neces- 
sary and most advantageous for 
the individual exhibiting it 

4. All of the above can be dras- 
tically affected by any random 
factor or set of random factors 

5. Self-determination exists only in 
a general sense 

6. “Behaviorism fellates both my 
generative organs.” — H. J. 
Lummolopo 

7. Mind, body, and soul form a 
single entity, but they decay at 
different times and at different 
rates of speed

L ummolopo’s speech: 

j “I come to yOu this evening 
with some very grave news for your 
people. It is news I hate to deliver; 
indeed, I am appalled that the de- 
cision which I am duty- bound to 
relate to you now was ever made.” 
(Here Lummolopo waved his ten- 
tacles of cartilage about.) 

“Look — I had a long speech pre- 
pared, but I think I’m just going to 
chuck it and speak in less formal 
terms. My government isn’t going

to like it, but that will be my worry, 
not yours. My speech was full of 
grief and depression, and I just 
don’t feel like making things worse 
either for you folks or for myself. 

“Very simply — myself and the 
rest of the Bardenian space re- 
search team are leaving. We may 
never come back.’’ 

(At this point, the room erupted 
into multi-media chaos.) 

“The decision to leave was not 
mine,’’ Lummolopo continued 
when the excitement had died 
down. “Indeed, I have grown very 
attached to Earth, and I am fas- 
cinated by human beings, and I do 
not wish to leave. 

“In fact, in my view, leaving 
Earth is one of the most asinine de- 
cisions that has ever been made. 
But, as was quickly pointed out to 
me, lam in no position to make the 
decisions, only to make recommen- 
dations. Those in power can ignore 
my recommendations as often as 
they please. 

“Essentially, that’s it. We’re 
leaving in the next four or-five days, 
and you’ll be on your own. Prob- 
ably permanently.” 

(Here he paused.) 

“If there are any questions. I’ll 
try to answer as many of them as I 
can.” 

****** 

S ome questions from the floor, 
and Lummolopo’s replies: 

Q: Mr. Lummolopo, you haven’t 


told us specifically who is respon- 
sible for the decision. 

A: Taolo Hodonna, our economic 
“president.” And our general pub- 
lic. 

Q: Mr. Lummolopo, did the 
public vote on the question? 

A: No. As you know, we have a 
democracy, as most of your people 
do. In a democracy, the dictators 
are elected rather than self-ap- 
pointed. But in a democracy, public 
opinion can rarely be ignored — al- 
though at times it can be manipu- 
lated by the leaders. 

Q: But Lummolopo, you’ve 
hardly begun your study of Earth. 
And you’ve hardly begun to help 
us. You’ve got us dependent on 
you, practically under your thumb, 
and now you’re going to leave us to 
rot. Don’t you realize — 

A: (interrupting) Please spare me 
questions of this sort. I repeat: I 
did not make this decision. Com- 
plain to Hodonna, not to me. This 
isn’t really my affair. 

Q: But don’t you agree that we 
will rot, go right back to where we 
were when you first arrived, maybe 
be in a worse position? How can 
you just stand by and — 

A: Don’t you understand? Much 
as you intrigue me, my obligations 
are to my own people. I sympathize 
with your position. And I agree 
with you: you’re in for some poten- 
tially hard times. Things will most 
likely be bad for you in the next few 
decades; I admit that freely. But I 
have some faith in you people; 


SAYING GOODBYE 


169 



you’re not that different from us. I 
honestly think there’s a pretty fair 
chance that you’ll pull through — 
without us. 

Q: It’s all a plot, isn’t it, Lummo- 
lopo? You had this planned from 
the beginning, I’ll bet. Making us 
dependent on you, then taking 
away — 

A: Don’t be an idiot. We don’t 
need another Akron riot. 

Q: Mr. Lummolopo, you still 
haven’t answered the most impor- 
tant question: why are you and your 
people leaving? What reason did 
Hodonna give for making you all 
leave? 

(At this point, Lummolopo’s 
body quivered violently.) 

A: Sir, we people of Barden have 
our problems, too. We can help you 
out because we’ve gone through the 
same things you have, and we man- 
aged to survive them. All that our 
advanced technology and advanced 
philosophy mean are that we have 
different problems from you. More 
complicated ones. The people of 
Barden simply no longer consider 
exploring Earth a worthwhile ven- 
ture. They insist that the money 
being used for space exploration 
could be put to better use back on 
Barden. Instead, programs on my 
home planet are being started up 
now — programs to make life all- 
around easier and more amusing 
for us. 

Q: But I thought you said that 
the exploration of Earth would 
yield a profit for Barden. 


A: It will — eventually. But my 
people say that’s not soon enough. 
They want their benefits now. 
(Lummolopo paused here.) Excuse 
me. I am very angry and very tired. 
Perhaps someday we will return to 
help you out once again — but that 
will not be until the attitudes of my 
people change. Perhaps there are 
people on yet another planet who 
will come to Earth and take our 
place. And maybe, somewhere in 
the universe, there are people who 
will come and teach us. (Lummo- 
lopo' paused.) Gentlemen and 
ladies, I am finished speaking for 
the night. I wish you all good for- 
tune. As you people say, ‘God bless 
you’. 

(Bardenians firmly deny the exis- 
tence of all deities.) 

T hree days later, the Bardenians 
left. There was a ceremony just 
before the liftoff. Lummolopo was 
invited to speak at the ceremony. 
He declined.

IF 




Dear Jim, 

Dr. T. Binding Phipps, the mathemati- 
cian in Christopher Anvil’s CANTOR’S 
WAR (Worlds of IF, June ’74) certainly does 
not seem to have made set theory or the 
problems of infinity his field of study. 

To begin with, Phipps (and the other 
characters involved, who as non-mathemati- 
cians may be forgiven) neglect to consider 
whether the sets of opposing spaceships in 
the story are of the same order of infinity. If, 
for example, the human-sent ships in the 
story’s Tau-space can be placed in 
one-to-one correspondence with the infinite 
series of integers (1, 2, 3 . .) while the 
enemy ships can be matched up with the 
infinite number of points on a line, we are 
truly outnumbered and had better sue for 
peace or find another space in which to 
tight. On the other hand, if the human ships 
equal in the size (or strength) of their infinity 
the number of possible geometric curves 
(Aleph Three, sez Cantor), then we can run 
those poirits-on-a-line ships right out of our 
part of the universe. 

Since the human-owned ships got clobber- 
ed in the story, we may assume that the 
enemy’s infinity did possess a higher Aleph- 
number than did ours. As for the problem of 
matching up the series of even integers with 
that of all integers, or manning an infinite 
tleet of spaceships with a corps of pilots 
drawn from only the even-numbered 
ships . 

When matching infinite sets, a rule of cor- 
respondence (not just an example “at one 
end") must be stated. Phipps’ adversaries in 
the argument are perfectly correct in stating 
that his showing them a few pairs of both 
scries matched proves nothing. Correspon- 
dence of the set of even integers matched 


with that of all integers should be stated 

1 2 3 . n . 

2 4 6 . ,2n . 

Note the all-important little n. Stated this 
way, we have a rule, which says that every 
integer in the series containing both odd and 
even is associated, paired off, with its 
double. No example can be produced of an 
integer for which this rule now fails to hold; 
therefore it is assumed to hold for all. 

In the case of the ships and pilots, let us 
assign each ship a number in order from the 
set of all integers. Each pilot will be assigned 
an even number, corresponding to that of 
the ship he is originally in. “Now hear this, 
now hear this. All pilots, leave your ships.” 
(Shuffle shufle, tramp tramp, clang clang.) 
“Now each of you guys find a ship whose 
number is one half, exactly, of your assigned 
number. Now get back in.” (Shuffle, tramp, 
clang, thud. Thud? Always an oddball in 
every outfit.) 

“You there, you don’t have a ship? 
What’s yer number? Four billion and 
twelve? Then you go into two billion six. 
Now if the Admiral finds any empty ships 
when he comes around to inspect, we’re 
gonna know the ^assigned numbers of the 
wise guys who are supposed to be in’em. So 
you better be there ...” 

May you print many more stories that are 
as much fun to read and think about. 

Joan & Fred Saberh^gen 

But personally I find Anvil a lot more fun to 
read ! Perhaps you, Fred, should write a 
story demonstrating the validity of Cantor’s 
Theorem! 

Dear Jim Baen, 

Good luck! Here is my subscription to IF 
and to Galaxy. 

1 had fun reading Christopher Anvil’s 
Cantor's War in your May-June jssue. I am 
now working for my Ph.D. thesis in mathe- 
matics. 

Here are my comments. What Cantor said 
is this: Let us agree that two sets have the 
same size if they can be put in one-to-one 
correspondence (i.e. if we can make pairs of 
elements, the first element of the pair being 
an element from our first set A, the second 
element of the pair being an element from 
our second set B, in such a way that if # is an 


171 



element of A, then there is exactly one pair 
with # as its first element, and if % if an ele- 
ment of B, then there is exactly one pair with 
% as its second element). 

Then, said Cantor, there are as many 
numbers as there are even (or, for that 
matter, odd) numbers. The proof of that is 
stated in Anvil’s story. 

Anvil questions later the validity of this re- 
sult by considering a “practical” example: 
an infinite number of spaceships, only one 
out of two is manned. He evokes mounting 
piles of empty spaceships, and the increas- 
ing difficulty of getting pilots as he builds his 
one-to-one correspondence between space- 
ships and pilots. Of course he is right. But 
what he says is irrelevant. The Cantor result 
takes no mention in the acrobatics involved 
in building a certain one-to-one correspon- 
dence; it depends only on whether the cor- 
respondence exists or not. 

If 1 had been in Phipp’s place, aside from 
being pleased at seeing military equipment 
wasted on the screen, 1 would have put my 
best sadistic-mathematical smile after the 
general's description of piles of empty space- 
ships, and told him that not only had he 
twice as many spaceships as he had pilots, 
but that at the same time he had fifty times 
as many pilots as he had spaceships. 

The point is. Cantor’s definition of “same 
size” is (as he knew, as everybody knows) 
coarse. It is useful because it is simple to 
state, and because it can be applied to any 
pair of sets, however dissimilar the sets. 
When one has additional information about 
the sets one w ishes to compare, then one can 
devise a suitable definition of what “same 
size” means in that particular context. This 
is done routinely in mathematics. 

For example, in Anvil’s story, the military 
men quite adequately were comparing the 
sizes of the forces by counting the finite 
number of spaceships of each army contain- 
ed in a square on the screen. They used the 
fact that they had squares in which to count 
ships, which is additional information on the 
sets involved, in order to devise a way of 
comparing sizes in a more precise fashion 
than Cantor's.

Well, Chris ? 


Dear Editor: 

One of your ’69 dropouts who picked up 
the June issue. In Chris Anvil’s Cantors 
War I did not really understand the part 
about Tau space and the blinding white 
light, etc. I think I did understand the pilots 
locked in every other one of an infinite num- 
ber of ships analogy. You could move the 
ships so there were 2 ships w ith pilots, then 2 
without, 2 with, 2 without, and so on. Then 
you could switch to 4P, 4W, 4P, 4W . 
then to 8P. 8W, 8P, 8W ... As a matter of 
fact, given enough time and any number n 
Anvil could name I could give him n in a row 
pilots, followed by n without and so on. 
Whicli (technically, Mr. Anvil) means that n 
increased without upper bound. Anyway 
Binding should have got Mary Lou. Glad to 
see Asimov back to his consistent first-class 
form (as compared to the debacle “The 
Gods Themselves"). Good luck.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I usually pass up IF. However, I found 
your June 1974 issue really FANTASTIC. I 
really think you got something. There is still 
some room for improvement concerning 
your cover. I think a much bolder approach 
should be taken. How about trying to get 
Kelly Freas to do some? 

Dick Geis’ column, “The Alien View- 
point,” is really tops. I think his column will 
add a lot to IF: fandom should be taken 
seriously. 

Sincerely yours, 

Roy D. Schickedanz 

Thank you, Roy. As for bold covers, take a 
look at August Galaxy. ( That one is so bold 
I'm a little nervous about it!) Fandom: I will 
take fandom seriously as long as fandom 
does not return the favor. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Your opening issue is most interesting, 
and 1 hope my comments on the stories 
might give you an idea of how well you're 
doing your job. 

SECOND ADVENT obviously tells us 
how and why Nixon cannot reveal certain 
tapes — maybe they don’t exist, since . 


172 


IF 



and; THE PEOPLE’S CHOICE shows us 
how a person like Nixon might get elected. 
Or am I wrong? 

BERSERKER’S PLANET — con’t next 
issue. 

The Asimov and Silverberg up to par for 
each. Nothing earthshattering, though. 
CANTOR'S WAR — a fine bit of mathema- 
tical fiction that sounds most logical. True, 
too; considering it was used in a real-world 
situation, not a ‘pure’ mathematical envir- 
onment. The Schmitz — another typical story 
by him, with a ‘surprise’ ending (I just can’t 
imagine him writing a gloomy story) that 
sets everything aright. 

NOSTRADAMUS — now; do we really 
need the sort of story that ends on a dooms- 
day note? 

It hadn’t corrupted itself much prior to 
that. 

Now: the features. If your promises can be 
delivered, maybe you’ll eventually have a 
group of goodies like AMAZING/FANTAS- 
TIC has. (That reminds me: “I don’t like 
Amazing because of an almost snobby edi- 
torial feel and a cry-baby attitude.” — Grim- 
shawe, p. 170 Issue No. 172. This sounds 
rather shallow to be published, and may 
anger some Amazing readers. I subscribe to 
the top six magazines, and must admit I 
favor White’s editorial policies. Maybe you 
can come up with something better. It 
doesn’t help, though, to shove aside the 
women-writer issue as if you’re going to be a 
male chauvinist. I would imagine around 
half your readers were women (20%. — Ed.) 
who also might believe you’re being biased. 
But, I give you the doubt well-deserved, and 
hope you receive fine manuscripts from our 
women writers.) 

Geis. I’ve heard about him, in fandom, 
but never seen anything of his. Now it looks 
like I’ll have the opportunity on a bimonthly 
basis (any chance of going monthly again?). 
Fine reading, it helps to know the people 
and their ideas behind sf. Del Rey good as 
usual with reviews, etc. 

Looking forward to issue next; as your 
first Galaxy.

“Second Advent” was (for me at least) little 


more than wistful-thinking. As for “The 
People’s Choice’’ — I have no idea. Dooms- 
day stories, as such, are neither called for 
nor uncalled for— depends on how good they 
are and the nature of the rest of the issue. 
Grimshawe's comments on Ted White ; I 
censored neither Grimshawe — nor Schenck. 

Now, as for sexual bias: I can think of 
nothing more biased — nor exploitive! — than 
an all-female issue. On the other hand, I am 
perfectly willing to “admit" that I consider 
Ursula K. Le Guin to be one of the top five 
living sf writers. (No, I'm not about to 
narrow it down any further . ) 

Dear Sir: 

You have printed a blasphemy in Mack 
Reynolds’ Second Advent, (June 1974 issue). 
The Book of Revelation teaches that the 
Lord Jesus Christ shall appearin the clouds, 
with power and glory, and that His coming 
in the clouds shall be equally visible from the 
west as from the EAST. 

Notwithstanding this clear Biblical doc- 
trine, Mack Reynolds has chosen to enact 
the second coming in darkness save for a 
few. Or to conceive and write of it being 
done that way, which is the same thing. 
Please inspect the stories of Mr. Reynolds 
more carefully from now on. We were so 
angry that it was asked and agreed to that I 
tear the offending story out of the magazine. 

Yours in Christ 

J. Parker Wilbem, Chairman 

Federal City Conservative Club 

While I may f not share Mr. Reynolds' views 
on this subject I must uphold his right to 
express them. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

As a reader of Galaxy and IF for a few 
years, I was beginning to suspect the maga- 
zines were sliding into the doldrums. In fact, 
I was toying with the idea of terminating my 
subscription, and just picking up the ones I 
wanted at the newsstand. Then things 
started improving for some unsuspected 
reason. And then the “New Editors Intro- 
ductory Issue" of IF arrived and really spun 
my head on its axis. Not only do I enjoy the 
new features in Galaxy and IF, but the 
stories themselves seem better in the 
brighter layouts of the magazines. 

I especially enjoyed the Pohl-Williamson 


HUE AND CRY 


173 



collaboration, and The Org's Egg fairly 
screams for at least one sequel. Anything by 
Bob Shaw is usually good, and Orbitsville is 
maintaining in my eyes his esteem as a 
writer. 

In closing, 1 would like to say that the 
most improved feature in the magazines (no 
fooling) are the contents pages. 

Sincerely, 
David Keller 

Thank you — 1 put a lot of work into those 
two pages! 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Pronunciation please — Ben, Bain, or 
Bean? [#2] 

I have been out of the habit of reading IF 
and Galaxy religiously for some years now. 
The editorial changes in the June IF took me 
by surprise. The longest I’d followed either 
mag lately was the four installments of “In- 
verted World” by Christopher Priest, and I 
found the ending a let-down. 

But the June IF looks good. Hope to see it 
go monthly again. (Remember when IF was 
every month and Galaxy every other? [Sure 
do.]) Even the new contents page looks 
snappy. 

“Stranger in Paradise” is not Asimov’s 
best, but any new sf by the Good Doctor is 
welcome. Silverberg, Anvil and Schmitz 
came up with a good assortment, and the 
shorts were good. If this keeps up for the 
next couple of issues, I’m going to subscribe 
instead of relying on fate at the newsstand. 

Reader Grimshawe was right in his letter 
about something missing since Fred Pohl 
left. I hope you can bring us an original ex- 
citement of your own. 

One of Pohl’s policies 1 wouldn’t mind 
seeing revived is the “one story by a novice” 
per issue, since I’m sending you a short 
under separate cover. 

Regarding Grimshawe’s suggestion for 
commenting on published sf, I’d like to 
mention a book I just read that I haven’t 
seen reviewed in any of the mags. EARTH- 
WRECK by Thomas N. Scortia, just pub- 
lished by Fawcett Gold Medal (95c). It’s a 
fast-paced story with a good plot and excel- 
lent characterizations. I’d recommend it 
highly. It’s an after-the-bomb story with a 
difference. 

I just reread A. E. van Vogt’s THE 
CHANGELING and it blew my mind. Not 


so much the story itself, but “President 
Jefferson Dayles” seeking reelection in the 
1972 elections. His inner thoughts and feel- 
ings, the extremes he’s willing to go to to in- 
sure winning reelection in ? 72 are like a 
prophecy of Watergate. If, van Vogt has 
been a prophet all these years and we didn’t 
know it, stay the hell away from Calonian 
Recruiting Centers! 

Good Luck, 
Jack Klein 

Are you. sir, perchance guilty of anti- 

Calonianism . .?

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Heartiest congratulations on your acces- 
sion to the galactic hot seat; and on getting 
R. E. (Heilige) Geis as columnist. Mr. Geis 
is a man of furious energy, pithy and point- 
ed. no less than slashing with the critical 
broadsword. While he is overly ready to get 
his sexual fantasies into his own zine, it is 
more than probable that he can be con- 
firmed in the thought that cleanliness is next 
to godliness. He is a fine and perceptive 
commentator with a wealth of bright one- 
liners and subtle twists of thought and idea. 

All of the very best critics, or perhaps 
nearly all, are in some sense academics, but 
certainly were trained in the groves of 
academe. Most of the authors of sf are self- 
made and self-taught, and generally there- 
fore suffer from some inferiority complex or 
other. This they display with petty antago- 
nist^, reviling the academic critic in an ex- 
hibition of ignorance. This is an unfortunate 
thing in the literary discipline, which is our 
most perfect democracy, and in which 
demagogery and mean ranting should have 
no place. 

With best regards and all good wishes, I 
remain, 

Very cordially yours, 

Alexander Doniphan Wallace 
306 E. Gatehouse Drive, Apt. H 
Metairie. Louisiana 70001 

Dear Jim: 

1 thank Dr. Wallace for his compliments. 
But he’s wrong about my sexual fantasies; 
they appeared indecently only in my 
personal journal (RICHARD E. GEIS #1-3 
and in THE ALIEN CRITIC #4) well over a 
year ago. 1 suppose his psyche is still twitter- 


174 


IF 



ing in shock since he ordered a copy of #2 as 
part of his ALIEN CRITIC subscription. 

I laughed like hell over his assertion that 
most sf authors feel inferior to academic 
critics. Everyone knows God’s 13th 
Commandment reads: English professors 
shall forever write dull, turgid, impenetrable 
prose. There’s no other possible explanation 
for writing that badly for publication. 

How’s that for petty antagonism? 

Best, 

Dick Geis 

Pretty good, Dick ! 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

This is the first issue of IF since Pohl quit 
that 1 have finished cover to cover. (And 
since 1 let niy subscription lapse.) With Ana- 
log over-rated and F & SF wallowing in artsy 
quasi-New Wave shorts, I was forced to fall 
back on Ted White’s efforts. Only moment 
of sorrow 1 will feel about your new editor- 
ship is that it may finish off Amazing at last 
by drawing the hard core Romantics back 
into IF and even Galaxy.
