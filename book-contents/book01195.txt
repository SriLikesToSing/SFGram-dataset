The Art Book of the Year 



THIS YEAR STEPHEN FABIAN WAS NOMI- 
NATED FOR A HUGO FOR THE FOURTH 
TIME IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. 

He deserves it. His magic pen and brush have dazzled fans 
in the lew short years he has been working. 

In March of this year, we published his first collection, 
THE BEST OF STEPHEN FABIAN 

Within a month after its release, people all over the country 
were raving about it. 

Here are some of the things they've said: 

From California: 

“Certainly the Fabian pictures are beautifully repro- 
duced, and I'll be glad to add the Folio to my collection. 
Four years ago I bought a Fabian original which looked so 
much like the reproduction in the folio that I checked them 
to see what the difference was. The differences were so 
minor, I almost didn't find them.” — L.W., Sacramento 
From Maryland: 

"My reactions upon examining the book are those of a 
man in awe of the beauty of art by a master, Anri the qual- 
ity ol the book itself, i.e., the paper and reproduction, are 
also magnificent. I'd like to purchase additional copies 
for gifts.” -R.G., Baltimore 

From Massachusetts: 

“The book is marvelous 1 The reproduction is superb, a 
really fine book. Fantastic!" -R.B.. New Bedford 

From Missouri: 

"I think the book is beautiful." -T.R , Kansas City 

From New York: 

"I'm very impressed, I consider Steve to be one of the 
top artists. Your book should help to establish his repu- 
tation even further, Congratulations.” -B.P., Binghamton 

From North Carolina: 

"Your book is a damned nice tribute to a great artist." 

— S.S.. Fayetteville 

From Ohio: 

"It is certainly a worthwhile collection and a nice tri- 
bute to an artist who has only begun to show what he can 
and will do. I would like to order another copy to give to a 
friend." — W.B.. North Canton 

From Tennessee: 

"Please send me another copy of THE BEST OF STE- 
PHEN FABIAN Congratulations on a beautiful piece of 
work." — K.T., Dayton 

"I just received THE BEST OF STEPHEN FABIAN in 
the mail today and I am most pleased with it. Hell, that’s 
an understatement. I'm wild about it! It's great. Reproduc- 
tion is good and so is the paper. The selection of work in- 
cluded is fine, I could go on and on. but suffice it to sey that 
I'm greatly pleased and certainly got my money's worth in 
this book." -R.B,, Evensville 

THE BEST OF STEPHEN FABIAN contains fifty of this 
brilliant artist’s finest drawings from Galaxy, If, Whispers, 
The Occult Lovecraft, Amazing, Fantastic, The Miscast Bar- 
barian, Outworlds, and more, more, more . Including

Birkson had the single 
most important personality 
trait for a bomb expert — 
he was very disarming! 

There was a bomb on the Ley- 
strasse, level forty-five, right outside 
the Bagatelle Flower and Gift 
Shoppe, about a hundred meters 
down the promenade from Prosper- 
ity Plaza. 

“I am a bomb,” the bomb said 
to passersby. “I will explode in 
four hours, five minutes, and seven- 
teen seconds. I have a force equal 
to fifty thousand English tons of 
trinitrotoluene.” 



A small knot of people gathered 
to look at it. 

‘‘I will go off in four hours, four 
minutes, and thirty-seven seconds.” 

A few people became worried as 
the bomb talked on. They remem- 
bered business elsewhere and hur- 
ried away, often toward the tube 
trains to King City. Eventually, the 
trains became over-crowded and 
there was some pushing and shov 
ing. 

The bomb was a metal cylinder, 
a meter high, two meters long, 
mounted on four steerable wheels 
There was an array of four televi- 
sion cameras mounted on top of the 
cylinder, slowly scanning through 
ninety degrees. No one could recall 

GALAXY 




how it came to be there. It looked a 
little like the municipal street- 
cleaning machines; perhaps no one 
had noticed it because of that. 

“I am rated at fifty kilotons,” 
the bomb said, with a trace of 
pride. 

The police were called. 

★ * ★ 

“A nuclear bomb, you say?” 
Municipal Police Chief Anna-Louise 
Bach felt sourness in the pit of her 
stomach and reached for a box of 
medicated candy. She was overdue 
for a new stomach, but the rate she 
went through them on her job 
coupled with the size of her 

BAGATELLE 



paycheck had caused her to rely 
more and more on these stopgap 
measures. And the cost of cloned 
transplants was going up. 

“It says fifty kilotons,” said the 
man on the screen. “I don’t see 
what else it could be. Unless it’s 
just faking, of course. We’re mov- 
ing in radiation detectors.” 

“You said ‘it says.’ Are you 
speaking of a note, or phone call, 
or what?” 

“No. It’s talking to us. Seems 
friendly enough, too, but we haven’t 
gotten around to asking it to 
disarm itself. It could be that its 
friendliness won’t extend that far.” 
“No doubt.” She ate another 
candy. “Call in the bomb squad, of 

7 



course. Then tell them to do noth- 
ing until I arrive, other than look 
the situation over. I’m going to 
make a few calls, then I’ll be there. 
No more than thirty minutes.” 

“All right. Will do.” 

There was nothing for it but to 
look for help. No nuclear bomb had 
ever been used on Luna. Bach had 
no - experience with them, nor did 
her bomb crew. She brought her 
computer on line. 

* * * 

Roger Birkson liked his job. It 
wasn’t so much the working 
conditions — which were appall- 
ing — but the fringe benefits. He 
was on call for thirty days, twenty - 
four hours a day, at a salary that 
was nearly astronomical. Then he 
got eleven months paid vacation. 
He was paid for the entire year 
whether or not he ever had to exer- 
cise his special talents during his 
thirty days duty. In that way, he 
was like a firefighter. In a way, he 
was a firefighter. 

He spent his long vacations in 
Luna. No one had ever asked 
Birkson why he did so; had they 
asked, he would not have known. 
But the reason was a subconscious 
conviction that one day the entire 
planet Earth would blow up in one 
glorious fireball. He didn’t want to 
be there when it happened. 

Birkson’s job was bomb disarm- 
ing for the geopolitical administra- 
tive unit called CommEcon Europe. 



On a busy shift he might save the 
lives of twenty million CE Euro- 
peans. 

Of the thirty-five Terran bomb 
experts vacationing on Luna at the 
time of the Leystrasse bomb scare, 
Birkson happened to be closest to 
the projected epicenter of the blast. 
The Central Computer found him 
twenty-five seconds after Chief 
Bach rang off from her initial re- 
port. He was lining up a putt on the 
seventeenth green of the Burning 
Tree underground golf course, a 
half kilometer from Prosperity 
Plaza, when his bag of clubs began 
to ring. 

Birkson was wealthy. He em- 
ployed a human caddy instead of 
the mechanical sort. The caddy 
dropped the flag he had been hold- 
ing and went to answer it. Birkson 
took a few practice swings, but 
found that his concentration had 
been broken. He relaxed, and took 
the call. 

“I need your advice,” Bach said, 
without preamble. “I’m the Chief 
of Municipal Police for New Dres- 
den, Anna-Louise Bach. I’ve had a 
report of a nuclear bomb on the 
Leystrasse, and I don’t have anyone 
with your experience in these mat- 
ters. Could you meet me at the tube 
station in ten minutes?” 

“Are you crazy? I’m shooting for 
a seventy-five with two holes to go, 
an easy three-footer on seventeen 
and facing a par five on the last 
hole, and you expect me to go chas- 
ing after a hoax?” 



8 



GALAXY 




“Do you know it to be a hoax?” 
Bach asked, wishing he would say 
yes. 

“Well, no, I just now heard 
about it, myself. But ninety percent 
of them are, you know.” 

“Fine. I suggest you continue 
your game. And since you’re so 
sure. I’m going to have Burning 
Tree sealed off for the duration of 
the emergency. I want you right 
there.” 

Birkson considered this. 

“About how far away is this 
‘Leystrasse’?” 

“About six hundred meters. Five 
levels up from you, and one sector 
over. Don’t worry. There must be 
dozens of steel plates between you 
and the hoax. You just sit tight, all 
right?” 

Birkson said nothing. 

“I’ll be at the tube station in ten 
minutes,” Bach said. “I’ll be in a 
special capsule. It’ll be the last one 
for five hours.” She hung up. 

Birkson contemplated the wall of 
the underground enclosure. Then he 
knelt on the green and lined up his 
putt. He addressed the ball, tapped 
it, and heard the satisfying rattle as 
it sank into the cup. 

He looked longingly at the 
eighteenth tee, then jogged off to 
the clubhouse. 

“I’ll be right back,” he called 
over his shoulder. 

* * ★ 

Bach’s capsule was two minutes 

bagatelle 



late, but she had to wait another 
minute for Birkson to show up. She 
fumed, trying not to glance at the 
timepiece embedded in her wrist. 

He got in, still carrying his put- 
ter, and their heads were jerked 
back as the capsule was launched. 
They moved for only a short dis- 
tance, then came to a halt. The door 
didn’t open. 

“The system’s probably tied up,” 
Bach said, squirming. She didn’t 
like to see the municipal ser- 
vices fail in the company of this 
Terrain. 

“Ah,” Birkson said, flashing a 
grin with an impossible number of 
square teeth. “A panic evacuation, 
no doubt. You didn’t have the tube 
system closed down, I suppose?” 

“No,” she said. “I . well, I 
thought there might be a chance to 
get a large number of people away 
from the area in case this thing does 
go off.” 

He shook his head, and grinned 
again. He put this grin after every 
sentence he spoke, like punctuation. 

“You’d better seal off the city. If 
it’s a hoax, you’re going to have 
hundreds of dead and injured from 
the panic. It’s a lost cause trying to 
evacuate. At most, you might save 
a few thousand.” 

“But ...” 

“Keep them stationary. If it goes 
off, it’s no use anyway. You’ll lose 
the whole city. And no one’s going 
to question your judgement because 
you’ll be dead. If it doesn’t go off, 
you’ll be sitting pretty for having 

9 




prevented a panic. Do it. I know.” 

Bach began to really dislike this 
man right then, but decided to fol- 
low his advice. And his thinking 
did have a certain cold logic. She 
phoned the station and had the lid 
clamped on the city. Now the cars 
in the cross-tube ahead would be 
cleared, leaving only her priority 
capsule moving. 

They used the few minutes delay 
while the order was implemented to 
size each other up. Bach saw a 
blonde, square-jawed young man in 
a checkered sweater and golf knick- 
ers. He had a friendly face, and 
that was what puzzled her. There 
was no trace of worry on his 
smooth features. His hands were 
steady, clasped calmly around the 
steel shaft of his putter. She 
wouldn’t have called his manner 
cocky or assured, but he did man- 
age to look cheerful. 

She had just realized that he was 
looking her over, and was wonder- 
ing what he saw, when he put his 
hand on her knee. He might as well 
have slapped her. She was stunned. 

“What are you . get your 
hand off me you . you ground- 
hog.” 

Birkson’s hand had been moving 
upward. He was apparently unfazed 
by the insult. He turned in his seat 
and reached for her hand. His smile 
was dazzling. 

“I just thought that since we’re 
stalled here with nothing else to do, 
we might start getting to know each 
other. No harm in that, is there? I 



just hate to waste any time, that’s 
all.” 

She wrenched free of his grasp 
and assumed a defensive posture, 
feeling trapped in a nightmare. But 
he relented, having no interest in 
pursuing the matter when he had 
been rebuffed. 

“All right. We’ll wait. But I’d 
like to have a drink with you, or 
maybe dinner. After this thing’s 
wrapped up, of course.” 

“ ‘This thing . ’ How can you 
think of something like that ...” 

“At a time like this. I know. I’ve 
heard it. Bombs get me homy, is 
all. So okay, so I’ll leave yog 
alone.” He grinned again. “But 
maybe you’ll feel different when this 
is over.” 

For a moment she thought she 
was going to throw up from a com- 
bination of revulsion and fear. Fear, 
of the bomb, not this awful man. 
Her stomach was twisted into a pret- 
zel, and here he sat, thinking of 
sex. W’hat was he, anyway? 

The capsule lurched again, and 
they were on their way. 

* ★ ★ 

The deserted Leystrasse made a 
gleaming frame of stainless steel 
storefronts and fluorescent ceiling 
for the improbable pair hurrying 
from the tube station in the Plaza: 
Birkson in in his anachronistic golf 
togs, cleats rasping on the polished 
rock floor, and Bach, half a meter 
taller than him, thin like a Lunar- 
ian. She wore the regulation uni- 



10 



GALAXY 




form of the Municipal Police, which 
was a blue armband and cap with 
her rank of chief emblazoned on 
them, a shoulder holster, an equip- 
ment belt around her waist from 
which dangled the shining and 
lethal-looking tools of her trade, 
cloth slippers, and a few scraps of 
clothing in arbitrary places. In the 
benign environment of Lunar cor- 
ridors, modesty had died out ages 
ago. 

They reached the cordon which 
had been established around the 
bomb, and Bach conferred with the 
officer in charge. The hall was 
echoing with off-key music. 

“What’s that?” Birkson asked. 

Officer Walters, the man to 
whom Bach had been speaking, 
looked Birkson over, weighing just 
how far he had to go in deference 
to this grinning weirdo. He was ob- 
viously the bomb expert Bach had 
referred to in an earlier call, but he 
was a Terran, and not a member of 
the force. Should he be addressed 
as ‘sir’? He couldn’t decide. 

“It’s the bomb. It’s been singing 
to us for the last five minutes. Ran 
out of things to say, I guess . ” 

“Interesting.” Swinging the put- 
ter lazily from side to side, he 
walked to the barrier of painted 
steel crowd-control sections. He 
started sliding one of them to the 
side. 

“Hold it . ah,, sir,” Walters 
said. 

“Wait a minute, Birkson,” Bach 
confirmed, running to the man and 

BAGATELLE 



almost grabbing his sleeve. She 
backed away at the last moment. 

“It said no one’s to cross that 
barrier,” Walters supplied to Bach’s 
questioning glance. “Says it’ll blow 
us all to the Farside.” 

“What is that damn thing, any- 
way?” Bach asked, plaintively. 

Birkson withdrew from the bar- 
rier and took Bach aside with a tact- 
ful touch on the arm. He spoke to 
her with his voice just low enough 
for Walters to hear. 

“It’s a cyborged human con- 
nected to a bomb, probably a 
uranium device,” he said. “I’ve 
stien the design. It’s just like one 
that went off in Johannesburg three 
years ago. I didn’t know they were 
still making them.” 

“I heard about it,” Bach said, 
feeling cold and alone. “Then you 
think it’s really a bomb? How do 
you know it’s a cyborg? Couldn’t it 
be tape recordings, or a computer?” 
Birkson rolled his eyes slightly, 
and Bach ^reddened. Damn it, they 
were reasonable questions. And to 
her surprise, he could not defend 
his opinion logically. She wondered 
what she was stuck with. Was this 
man really the expert she took him 
to be, or a plaid-sweatered im- 
poster? 

“You can call it a hunch. I’m 
going to talk to this fellow, and I 
want you to roll up an industrial 
x-ray unit on the level below this 
while I’m doing it. On the level 
above, photographic film. You get 
the idea?” 

11 




“You want to take a picture of 
the inside of this thing. Won’t that 
be dangerous?” 

“Yeah. Are your insurance pre- 
miums paid up?” 

Bach said nothing, but gave the 
orders. A million questions were 
spinning through her head, but she 
didn’t want to make a fool of her- 
self by asking a stupid one. Such 
as: how much radiation did a big 
industrial x-ray machine produce 
when beamed through a rock and 
steel floor? She had a feeling she 
wouldn’t like the answer. She 
sighed, and decided to let Birkson 
have his head until she felt he 
couldn’t handle it. He was about the 
only hope she had. 

And he was strolling casually 
around the perimeter, swinging his 
goddam putter behind him, whis- 
tling bad harmony with the tune com- 
ing from the bomb. What was a 
career police officer to do? Back 
him up on the harmonica? 

The scanning cameras atop the 
bomb stopped their back and forth 
motion. One of them began to track 
Birkson. He grinned his flashiest, 
and waved to it. The music 
stopped. 

“I am a fifty kiloton nuclear 
bomb of the uranium-235 type,” it 
said. “You must stay behind the 
perimeter I have caused to be 
erected here. You must not disobey 
this order.” 

Birkson held up his hands, still 
grinning, and splayed out his fin- 
gers. 

12 



“You got me, bud. I won’t 
bother you. I was just admiring 
your casing. Pretty nice job, there. 
It seems a shame to blow it up.” 
“Thank you,” the bomb said, 
cordially. “But that is my purpose. 
You cannot divert me from it.” 
“Never entered my mind. Prom- 
ise.” 

“Very well. You may continue 
to admire me, if you wish, but from 
a safe distance. Do not attempt to 
rush me. All my vital wiring is 
safely protected, and I have a re- 
sponse time of three milliseconds. I 
can ignite long before you can reach 
me, but I do not wish to do so until 
the alloted time has come.” 

Birkson whistled. “That’s pretty 
fast, brother. Much faster than me, 
I’m sure. It must be nice, being 
able to move like that after blunder- 
ing along all your life with neural 
speeds.” 

“Yes, I find it very' gratifying. It 
was a quite unexpected benefit of 
becoming a bomb.” 

This was more like it, Bach 
thought. Her dislike of Birkson had 
not blinded her to the fact that he 
had been checking out his hunch. 
And her questions had been an- 
swered: no tape array could answer 
questions like that, and the machine 
had as much as admitted that it had 
been a human being at one time. 

Birkson completed a circuit, back 
to where Bach and Walters were 
standing. He paused, and said in a 
low voice, “Check out that time.” 
“What time?” 



GALAXY 




“What time did you say you 
were going to explode?” he yelled. 

“In three hours, twenty-one min- 
utes, and eighteen seconds,” the 
bomb supplied. 

“That time,” he whispered. 
“Get your computers to work on it. 
See if it’s the anniversary of any 
political group, or the time some- 
thing happened that someone might 
have a grudge about.” He started to 
turn away, then thought of some- 
thing. “But most important, check 
the birth records.” 

“May 1 ask why?” 

He seemed to be dreaming, but 
came back to them. “I’m just feel- 
ing this character out. I’ve got a 
feeling this might be his birthday. 
Find out who was born at that 
time — it can’t be too many, down 
to the second — and try to locate 
them all. The one you can’t find 
will be our guy. I’m betting on it.” 
“What are you betting? And how 
do you know for sure it’s a man?” 
That look again, and again she 
blushed. But, damn it, she had to 
ask questions. Why should he make 
her feel defensive about it?’ 

“Because he’s chosen a male 
voice to put over his speakers. I 
know that’s not conclusive, but you 
get hunches after a while. As to 
what I’m betting . no, it’s not 
my life. I’m sure I can get this one. 
How about dinner tonight if I’m 
right?” The smile was ingenuous, 
without the trace of lechery she 
thought she had seen before. But 
her stomach was still crawling. She

turned away without answering. 

For the next twenty minutes, 
nothing much happened. Birkson 
continued his slow stroll around the 
machine, stopping from time to 
time to shake his head in admira- 
tion. The thirty men and women of 
Chief Bach’s police detail stood 
around nervously with nothing to 
do, as far away from the machine 
as pride would allow. There was no 
sense in taking cover. 

Bach herself was kept busy coor- 
dinating the behind-the-scenes man- 
euvering from a command post that 
had been set up around the comer, 
in the Elysian Travel Agency. It 
had phones and a computer output 
printer. She sensed the dropping 
morale among her officers, who 
could see nothing going on. Had 
they known that surveying lasers 
were poking their noses around 
trees in the Plaza, taking bearings to 
within a thousandth of a millimeter, 
they might have felt a little better. 
And on the floor below, the x-ray 
had arrived. 

Ten minutes later, the output 
began to chatter. Bach could hear it 
in the silent, echoing corridor from 
her position halfway between the 
travel agency and the bomb. She 
turned, and met a young officer 
with the green armband of a rookie. 
The woman’s hand was ice-cold as 
she handed Bach the sheet of yel- 
low printout paper. There were 
three names printed on it, and 
below that, some dates and events 
listed.

“This bottom information was 
from the fourth expansion of the 
problem,’’ the officer explained. 
“Very low probability stuff. The 
three people were all bom either on 
the second or within a three-second 
margin of error, in three different 
years. Everyone else had been con- 
tacted.” 

“Keep looking for these three, 
too,” Bach said. As she turned 
away, she noticed that the young 
officer was pregnant, about in her 
fifth month. She thought briefly of 
sending her away from the scene, 
but what was the use? 

Birkson saw her coming, and 
broke off his slow circuits of the 
bomb. He took the paper from her 
and scanned it. He tore off the bot- 
tom part without being told it was 
low probability, crumpled it, and let 
it drop to the floor. Scratching his 
head, he walked slowly back to the 
bomb. 

“Hans?” he called out. 

“How did you know my name?” 
the bomb asked. 

“Ah, Hans, my boy, credit us 
with some sense. You can’t have 
got into this without knowing that 
the MuniPol can do very fast inves- 
tigations. Unless I’ve been under- 
estimating you. Have I?” 

“No,” the bomb conceded. “I 
knew you would find out who I 
was. But it doesn’t alter the situa- 
tion.” 

“Of course not. But it makes for 
easier conversation. How has life 
been treating you, my friend?”

“Terrible,” mourned the man 
who had become a fifty kiloton nu- 
clear weapon. 

★ ★ ★ 

Every morning Hans Lei ter rolled 
out of bed and padded into his cozy 
water closet. It was not the standard 
model for residential apartment 
modules, but a special one he had 
installed after he moved in. Hans 
lived alone, and it was the one lux- 
ury he allowed himself. In his little 
palace, he sat in a chair that mas- 
saged him into wakefulness, washed 
him, shaved him, powdered him, 
cleaned his nails, splashed him with 
scent, then made love to him with a 
rubber imitation that was a good 
facsimile of the real thing. Hans 
was awkward with women. 

He would dress, walk down three 
hundred meters of corridor, and sur- 
render himself to a pedestrian 
slideway which took him as far as 
the Cross-Crisium Tube. There, he 
allowed himself to be fired like a 
projectile through a tunnel below 
the Lunar surface. 

Hans worked in the Crisium 
Heavy Machine Foundary, His job 
there was repairing almost anything 
that broke down. He was good at it; 
he was much more comfortable with 
machines than with people. 

One day he made a slip and got 
his leg caught in a massive roller. It 
was not a serious accident, because 
the failsafe systems turned off the 
machine before his body or head 

GALAXY 




could be damaged, but it hurt terri- 
bly and completely ruined the leg. 
It had to be taken off. While he was 
waiting for the cloned replacement 
limb to be grown, Hans had been 
fitted with a prosthetic. 

It has been a revelation to him. It 
worked like a dream, as good as his 
old leg and perhaps better. It was 
connected to his severed leg nerve, 
but was equipped with a threshold 
cut-off circuit, and one day when he 
barked his artificial shin he saw that 
it had caused him no pain. He re- 
called the way that same injury had 
felt with his flesh and blood leg, 
and again he was impressed. He 
thought, too, of the agony when his 
leg had been caught in the machine. 

When the new leg was ready for 
transplanting, Hans had elected to 
retain the prosthetic. It was unusual, 
but not unprecedented. 

From that time on, Hans, who 
had never been known to his co- 
workers as talkative or social, with- 
drew even more from his fellow 
humans. He would speak only when 
spoken to. But people had observed 
him talking to the stamping press, 
and the water cooler, and the robot 
sweeper. 

At night, it was Hans’ habit to sit 
on his vibrating bed and watch the 
holovision until one o’clock. At that 
time, his kitchen would prepare him 
a late snack, roll it to him in his 
bed, and he would retire for the 
night. 

For the last three years Hans had 
been neglecting to turn the set on 

bagatelle 



before getting into bed. Neverthe- 
less, he continued to sit quietly on 
the bed staring at the empty screen. 

★ ★ ★ 

When she finished reading the 
personal data printout, Baqh was 
struck once more at the efficiency 
of the machines in her control. This 
man was almost a cipher, yet there 
were nine thousand words in storage 
concerning his uneventful life, 
ready to be called up and printed 
into an excruciatingly boring biog- 
raphy. 

“ ... so you came to feel that 
you were being controlled at every 
step of your life by machines,” 
Birkson was saying. He was sitting 
on one of the barriers, swinging his 
legs back and forth. Bach joined 
him and offered the long sheet of 
printout. He waved it away. She 
could hardly blame him. 

“But it’s true!” the bomb said. 
“We all are, you know. We’re part 
of this huge machine that’s called 
New Dresden. It moves us around 
like parts on am assembly line, 
washes us, feeds us, puts us to bed 
and sings us to sleep.” 

“Ah,” Birkson said, agreeably. 
“Are you a Luddite, Hans?” 

“No!” the bomb said in a 
shocked voice. “Roger, you’ve 
missed the whole point. I don’t 
want to destroy the machines. I 
want to serve them better. I wanted 
to become a machine, like my new 
leg. Don’t you see? We’re part of 

15 




the machine, but we’re the most in- 
efficient part.” 

The two talked on, and Bach 
wiped the sweat from her palms. 
She couldn’t see where all this was 
going, unless Birkson seriously 
hoped to talk Hans Leiter out of 
what he was going to do in — she 
glanced at the clock — two hours and 
forty-three minutes. It was madden- 
ing. On the one hand, she recog- 
nized the skill he was using in es- 
tablishing a rapport with the cyborg. 
They were on a first-name basis, 
and at least the damn machine cared 
enough to argue its position. On the 
other hand, so what? What good 
was it doing? 

Walters approached and whis- 
pered into her ear. She nodded, and 
tapped Birkson on the shoulder. 

“They’re ready to take the pic- 
ture whenever you are,” she said. 

He waved her off. 

“Don’t bother me,” he said, 
loudly. “This is getting interesting. 
So if what you say is true,” he 
went on to Hans, getting up and 
pacing intently back and forth, this 
time inside the line of barriers, 
“maybe I ought to look into this 
myself. You really like being 
cyborged better than being hu- 
man?” 

“Infinitely so,” the bomb said. 
He sounded enthusiastic. “I need 
no sleep now, and I no longer have 
to bother with elimination or eat- 
ing. I have a tank for nutrients, 
which are fed into the housing 
where my brain and central nervous 

16 



system are located.” He paused. “I 
tried to eliminate the ups and downs 
of hormone flow and the emotional 
reactions that followed,” he con- 
fided. 

“No dice, huh?” 

“No. Something always dis- 
tracted me. So when I heard of this 
place where they would cyborg me 
and get rid of all that, I jumped at 
the chance.” 

Inactivity was making Bach im- 
pulsive. She had to say or do some- 
thing. 

“Where did you get the work 
done, Hans?” she ventured. 

The bomb started to say some- 
thing, but Birkson laughed loudly 
and slapped Bach hard on the back. 
“Oh, no, Chief. That’s pretty 
tricky, right Hans? She’s trying to 
get you to rat. That’s not done, 
Chief. There’s no point of honor 
involved.” 

“Who is that?” the bomb asked, 
suspiciously. 

“Let me introduce Chief Anna- 
Louise Bach, of the New Dresden 
Police. Ann, meet Hans,” 

“Police?” Hans asked, and Bach 
felt goose-pimples when she de- 
tected a note of fright in the voice. 
What was this maniac trying to do, 
frightening the guy like that? She 
was close to pulling Birkson off the 
case. She held off because she 
thought she could see a familiar pat- 
tern in it, something she could use 
as a way to participate, even if ig- 
nominiously. It was the old good 
guy-bad guy routine, one of the 

GALAXY 




oldest police maneuvers in the 
book. 

“Aw, don’t be like that,’’ 
Birkson said to Hans. “Not all cops 
are brutes. Ann here, she’s a nice 
person. Give her a chance. She’s 
only doing her job.’’ 

“Oh, I have no objection to 
police,” the bomb said. “They are 
necessary to keep the social 
machine functioning. Law and order 
is a basic precept of the coming 
new Mechanical Society. I’m 
pleased to meet you, Chief Bach. I 
wish the circumstances didn’t make 
us enemies,” 

“Pleased to meet you, Hans.” 
She thought, carefully before she 
phrased her next question. She 
wouldn’t have to take the hard-line 
approach to contrast herself with 
affable, buddy-buddy Birkson. She 
needn’t be an antagonist, but it 
wouldn’t hurt if she asked questions 
that probed at his motives. 

“Tell me, Hans. You say you’re 
not a Luddite. You say you like 
machines. Do you know how many 
machines you’ll destroy if you set 
yourself off? And even more impor- 
tant, what you’ll do to this social 
machine you’ve been talking about? 
You’ll wipe out the whole city.” 

The bomb seemed to be groping 
for words. He hesitated, and Bach 
felt the first glimmer of hope since 
this insanity began. 

“You don’t understand. You’re 
speaking from an organic view- 
point. Life is important to you. A 
machine is not concerned with life. 

BAGATELLE 



Damage to a machine, even the so- 
cial machine, is simply something 
to be repaired. In a way, I hope to 
set an example. I wanted to become 
a machine — ” 

“And the best, the very ultimate 
machine,” Birkson put in, “is the 
atomic bomb. It’s the end point of 
all mechanical thinking.” 

“Exactly,” said the bomb, 
sounding very pleased. It was nice 
to be understood. “I wanted to be 
the very best machine I could pos- 
sibly be, and it had to be this.” 

“Beautiful, Hans,” Birkson 
breathed. “I see what you’re talking 
about. So if we go on with that 
line of thought we logically come 
to the conclusion ...” and he was 
off into an exploration of the fine 
points of the new Mechanistic world 
view. 

Bach was trying to decide which 
was the crazier of the two, when 
she was handed another message. 
She read it, then tried to find a 
place to break into the conversation. 
But there was no convenient place. 
Birkson was more and more ani- 
mated, almost frothing at the mouth 
as he discovered points of ageement 
between the two of them. Bach 
noticed her officers standing around 
nervously, following the conversa- 
tion. It was clear from their expres- 
sions that they feared they were 
being sold out, that when zero hour 
arrived they would still be here 
watching intellectual ping-pong. But 
long before that, she could have a 
mutiny on her hands. Several of 

17 




them were fingering their weapons, 
probably without even knowing it. 

She touched Birkson on the 
sleeve, but he waved her away. 
Damn it, this was too much. She 
grabbed him and nearly pulled him 
from his feet, swung him around 
until her mouth was close to his ear 
and growled. 

“Listen to me, you idiot. They’re 
going to take the picture. You’ll 
have to stand back some. It’s better 
if we’re all shielded.” 

“Leave me alone," he shot back, 
and pulled from her grasp. But he 
was still smiling. “This is just get- 
ting interesting,” he said, in a nor- 
mal tone of voice. 

Birkson came near to dying in 
that moment. Three guns were 
trained on him from the circle of of- 
ficers, awaiting only the order to 
fire. They didn’t like seeing their 
Chief treated that way. 

Bach herself was damn near to 
giving the order. The only thing 
that stayed her hand was the knowl- 
edge that with Birkson dead, the 
machine might go off ahead of 
schedule. The only thing to do now 
was to get him out of the way and 
go on as best she could, knowing 
that she was doomed to failure. No 
one could say she hadn’t given the 
expert a chance. 

“But what I was wondering 
about,” Birkson was saying, “was 
why today? What happened today? 
Is this the day Cyrus McCormick 
invented the combine harvester, or 
something?” 

18 



“It’s my birthday,” Hans said, 
somewhat shyly. 

“Your birthday ?” Birkson 
managed to look totally amazed to 
learn what he already knew. “Your 
birthday. That’s great, Hans. Many 
happy returns of the day, my 
friend.” He turned and took in all 
of the officers with an expansive 
sweep of his hands. “Let’s sing, 
people. Come on, it’s his birthday, 
for heaven’s sake. Happy birthday 
to you, happy birthday to you, 
happy birthday dear Hans ...” 

He bellowed, he was off-key, he 
swept his hands in grand circles 
with no sense of rhythm. But so in- 
fectious was his mania that several 
of the officers found themselves 
joining in. He ran around the circle, 
pulling the words out of them with 
great scooping motions of his 
hands. 

Bach bit down hard on the inside 
of her cheek to keep herself steady. 
She had been singing, too. The 
scene was so ridiculous, so blackly 
improbable . 

She was not the only one who 
was struck the same way. One of 
her officers, a brave man who she 
knew personally to have shown 
courage under fire, fell on his face 
in a dead faint. A woman officer 
covered her face with her hands and 
fled down the corridor, making 
helpless coughing sounds. She 
found an alcove and vomited. 

And still Birkson capered. Bach 
had her gun half-way out of the 
shoulder holster, when he shouted. 



GALAXY 




“What’s a birthday without a 
party?” he asked. “Let’s have a big 
party.” He looked around, fixed on 
the flower shop. He started for it, 
and as he passed Bach he whis- 
pered, “Take the picture now.” 

It galvanized her. She desperately 
wanted to believe he knew what he 
was doing, and just at the moment 
when his madness seemed total he 
had shown her the method. A dis- 
traction. Please, let it be a distrac- 
tion. She turned and gave the prear- 
ranged signal to the officer standing 
at the edge of Prosperity Plaza. 

She turned back in time to see 
Birkson smash in the window of the 
flower shop with his putter. It made 
a deafening crash. 

“Goodness,” said Hans, who 
sounded truly shocked. “Did you 
have to do that? That’s private 
property.” 

“What does it matter?” Birkson 
yelled. “Hell, man, you’re going to 
do much worse real soon. I’m just 
getting things started.” He reached 
in and pulled out an armload of 
flowers, signalling to others to give 
him a hand. The police didn’t like 
it, but soon were looting the shop 
and building a huge wreath just out- 
side the line of barriers. 

“I guess you’re right,” said 
Hans, a little breathlessly. A taste 
of violence had excited him, whet- 
ted his appetite for more to come. 
“But you startled me. I felt a real 
thrill, like I haven’t felt since I was 
human.” 

“Then let’s do it some more.” 

BAGATELLE 



And Birkson ran up and down one 
side of the street, breaking out 
every window he could reach. He 
picked up small articles he found 
inside the shops and threw them. 
Some of them shattered when they 
hit. 

He finally stopped. Leystrasse 
had been transformed. No longer 
the scrubbed and air-conditioned 
Lunar environment, it had become 
as shattered, chaotic and uncertain 
as the tension-filled emotional at- 
mosphere it contained. Bach shud- 
dered and swallowed the rising taste 
of bile. It was a precursor of things 
to come, she was sure. It hit her 
deeply to see the staid and respecta- 
ble Leystrasse ravaged. 

“A cake,” Birkson said. “We 
have to have a cake. Hold on a 
minute, I’ll be right back.” He 
strode quickly toward Bach, took 
her elbow and turned her, pulled 
her insistently away with him. 

“You have to get those officers 
away from here,” he said, conver- 
sationally. “They’re tense. They 
could explode at any minute. In 
fact,” and he favored her with his 
imbecile grin, “they’re probably 
more dangerous right now than the 
bomb.” 

“You mean you think it’s a 
fake?” 

“No. It’s for real. I know the 
psychological pattern. After this 
much trouble, he won’t want to be 
a dud. Other types, they’re in it for 
the attention and they’d just as soon 
fake it. Not Hans. But what I mean 

19 




is, I have him. I can get him. But I 
can’t count on your officers. Pull 
them back and leave only two or 
three of your most trusted people.” 

“All right.” She had decided 
again, more from a sense of help- 
less futility than anything else, to 
trust him. He had pulled a neat 
diversion with the flower shop and 
the x-ray. 

“We may have him already,” he 
went on, as they reached the end of 
the street and turned the corner. 
“Often, the x-ray is enough. It 
cooks some of the circuitry and 
makes it unreliable. I’d hope to kill 
him outright, but he’s shielded. Oh, 
he’s probably got a lethal dosage, 
but it’d take him days to die. That 
doesn’t do us any good. And if his 
circuitry is knocked out, the only 
way to find out is to wait. We have 
to do better than that. Here’s what I 
want you to do.” 

He stopped abruptly and relaxed, 
leaning against the wall and gazing 
out over the trees and artificial sun- 
light of the Plaza. Bach could hear 
songbirds. They had always made 
her feel good before. Now all she 
could think of was incinerated 
corpses. Birkson ticked off points 
on his fingers. 

She listened to him carefully. 
Some of it was strange, but no 
worse than she had already witness- 
ed. And he really did have a plan. 
He really did. The sense of relief 
was so tremendous that it threatened 
to create a mood of euphoria in her, 
one not yet justified by the cir- 

20 



cumstances. She nodded curtly to 
each of his suggestions, then again 
to the officer who stood beside her, 
confirming what Birkson had said 
and turning it into orders. The 
young man rushed off to carry them 
out and Birkson started to return to 
the bomb. Bach grabbed him. 

“Why wouldn’t you let Hans an- 
swer my question about who did the 
surgical work on him? Was that part 
of your plan?” The question was 
half belligerant. 

“Oh. Yeah, it was, in a way. I 
just grabbed the opportunity to 
make him feel closer to me. But it 
wouldn’t have done you any good. 
He’ll have a block against telling 
that, for sure. It could even be set 
to explode the bomb if he tries to 
answer that question. Hans is a 
maniac, but don’t underestimate the 
people who helped him get where 
he is now. They’ll be protected.” 
“Who are they?” 

Birkson shrugged. It was such a 
casual, uncaring gesture that Bach 
was annoyed again. 

“I have no idea. I’m not politi- 
cal, Ann. I don’t know the Anti- 
abortion Movement from the Free- 
dom for Mauretania League. They 
build ’em, I take ’em apart. It’s as 
simple as that. Your job is to find 
out how it happened. I guess you 
ought to get started on that.” 

“We already have,” she con- 
ceded. “I just thought that . 
well, coming from Earth, where 
this sort of thing happens all the 
time, that you might know . 

GALAXY 




damn it, Birkson. Why ? Why is this 
happening?” 

He laughed, while Bach turned 
red and went into a slow boil. Any 
of her officers, seeing her expres- 
sion, would have headed for the 
nearest blast shelter. But Birkson 
laughed on. Didn’t he give a damn 
about anything? 

“Sorry,” he forced out. “I’ve 
heard that question before, from 
other police chiefs. It’s a good 
question.” He waited, a half-smile 
on his face. When she didn’t say 
anything, he went on. 

“You don’t have the right 
perspective on this, Ann.” 

“That’s Chief Bach to you, damn 
you.” 

“Okay,” he said, easily. “What 
you don’t see is that this thing is no 
different from a hand grenade 
tossed into a crowd, or a bomb sent 
through the mail. It’s a form of 
communication. It’s just that today, 
with so many people, you have to 
shout a little louder to get any atten- 
tion.” 

“But . who? They haven’t 
even identified themselves. You’re 
saying that Hans is a tool of these 
people. He’s been wired into the 
bomb, with his own motives for 
exploding. Obviously he didn’t have 
the resources to do this himself, I 
can see that.” 

“Oh, you’ll hear from them. I 
don’t think they expect him to be 
successful. He’s a warning. If they 
were really serious they could find 
the sort of person they want, one 

BAGATELLE 



who’s politically committed and 
will die for the cause. Of course, 
they don’t care if the bomb goes 
off; they’ll be pleasantly surprised if 
it does. Then they can stand up and 
pound their chests for a while. 
They’ll be famous.” 

“But where did they get the 
uranium? The security is ... ” 

For the first time, Birkson 
showed a trace of annoyance. 

“Don’t be silly. The path leading 
to today was irrevocably set in 
1945. There was never any way to 
avoid it. The presence of a tool im- 
plies that it will be used. You can 
try your best to keep it in the hands 
of what you think of as responsible 
people, but it’ll never work. And 
it’s no different, that’s what I’m 
saying. This bomb is just another 
weapon. It’s a cherry bomb in an 
anthill. It’s gonna cause one hill of 
ants a hell of a lot of trouble, but 
it’s no threat to the race of ants.” 

Bach could not see it that way. 
She tried, but it was still a night- 
mare of entirely new proportions to 
her. How could he equate the kill- 
ing of millions of people with a 
random act of violence where three 
or four might be hurt? She was 
familiar with that. Bombs went off 
every day in her city, as in every 
human city. People were always 
dissatisfied. 

“I could walk down ... no, it’s 
up here, isn’t it?” Birkson mused 
for a moment on cultural differ- 
ences. “Anyway, give me enough 
money and I’ll bet I could go up to 

21 




your slum neighborhoods right this 
minute and buy you as many kilos 
of uranium or plutonium as you 
want. Which is something you 
ought to be doing, by the way. 
Anything can be bought. Anything. 
For the right price, you could have 
bought weapons-grade material on 
the black market as early as 1960 or 
so. It would have been very expen- 
sive; there wasn’t much of it. You’d 
have had to buy a lot of people. But 
now . well, you think it out.” 
He stopped, and seemed embarrass- 
ed by his outburst. 

“I’ve read a little about this,” he 
apologized. 

She did think it out as she fol- 
lowed him back to the cordon. 
What he said was true, When con- 
trolled fusion proved too costly for 
wide-scale use, humanity had opted 
for fast breeder reactors. There had 
been no other choice. And from that 
moment, nuclear bombs in the 
hands of terrorists had been the 
price humanity accepted. And the 
price they would continue to pay. 

“I wanted to ask you one more 
question,” she said. He stopped and 
turned to face her. His smile was 
dazzling. 

“Ask away. But are you going to 
take me up on that bet?” 

She was momentarily unsure 
of what he meant 
“Oh. Are you saying you’d help 
us locate the underground uranium 
ring? I’d be grateful ...” 

“No, no. Oh, I’ll help you. I’m 
sure I can make a contact. I used to 

22 



do that before I got into this game. 
What I meant was, are you going to 
bet I can’t find some? We could 
bet . say, a dinner together as 
soon as I’ve found it. Time limit of 
seven days. How about it?” 

She thought she had only two al- 
ternatives: walk away from him, or 
kill him. But she found a third. 

“You’re a betting man. I guess I 
can see why. But that’s what I 
wanted to ask you. How can you 
stay so calm? Why doesn’t this get 
to you like it does to me and my 
people? You can’t tell me it’s sim- 
ply that you’re used to it.” 

He thought about it. “And why 
not? You can get used to anything, 
you know. Now what about that 
bet?” 

“If you don’t stop talking about 
that,” she said, quietly, “I’m going 
to break your arm.” 

“All right.” He said nothing fur- 
ther, and she asked no further ques- 
tions.

The fireball grew in milliseconds 
into an inferno that could scarcely 
be described in terms comprehensi- 
ble to humans. Everything in a 
half-kilometer radius simply van- 
ished into super-heated gases and 
plasma: buttresses, plate-glass win- 
dows, floors and ceilings, pipes, 
wires, tanks, machines, gewgaws 
and trinkets by the million, books, 
tapes, apartments, furniture, house- 
hold pets, men, women, and chil- 

GALAXY 





dren. They were the lucky ones. 
The force of the expanding blast 
compressed two hundred levels 
below it like a giant sitting on a 
Dagwood sandwich, making holes 
through plate steel turned to putty 
by the heat is easily as a punch 
press through tinfoil. Upwards, the 
surface bulged into* the soundless 
Lunar night and split to reveal a 
white hell beneath. Chunks flew 
away, chunks as large as city sec- 
tors. before the center collapsed 
back on itself to leave a crater 
whose walls were a maze of com- 
partments and ant-tunnels that drip- 
ped and flowed like warm gelatin. 
No trace was left of human bodies 
within two kilometers of the explo- 
sion. They had died after only the 
shortest period of suffering, their 
bodies consumed or spread into an 
invisible layer of organic film by 
the combination of heat and pres- 
sure that passed through walls, en- 
tered rooms where the doors were' 
firmly shut. Farther away, the 
sound was enough to congeal the ; 
bodies of a million people before' 





the heat roasted them, the blast 
stripped flesh from bones to leave 
shrunken stick figures. Still the ef- 
fects attenuated as the blast was 
channeled into corridors that were 
structurally strong enough to remain 
intact, and that very strength was 
the downfall of the inhabitants of 
the maze. Twenty kilometers from 
the epicenter, pressure doors popped 
through steel flanges like squeezed 
watermelon seeds. 

What was left was five million 
burnt, blasted corpses, and ten mil- 
lion injured so hideously that they 
would die in hours or days. But 
Bach had been miraculously thrown 
clear by some freak of the explo- 
sion. She hurtled through the void 
with fifteen million ghosts following 
her, and each carried a birthday 
cake. They were singing. She 
joined in. 

“ Happy birthday to you, happy 
birthday ...” 

“Chief Bach.” 

“Huh?” She felt a cold chill pass 
over her body. For a moment she 
could only stare down into the face 
of Roger Birkson. 

“You all right now?” he asked. 
He looked concerned. 

“I’m . what happened?” 

He patted her on both arms, then 
shook her heartily. 

“Nothing. You drifted off for a 
moment.” He narrowed his eyes. 
“I think you were daydreaming. I 
want to be diplomatic about 
this ... ah, what I mean . I’ve 
seen it happen before. I think you 

24 



were trying to get away from us.” 

She rubbed her hands over her 
face. 

“I think I was. But I sure went 
in the wrong direction. I’m all right 
now.” She could remember it now, 
and knew she had not passed out or 
become totally detached from what 
was going on. She had watched it 
all. Her memories of the explosion, 
so raw and real a moment before., 
were already the stuff of night- 
mares. 

Too bad she hadn’t come awake 
into a better world. It was so damn 
unfair. That was the reward at the 
end of a nightmare, wasn’t it? You 
woke up to find everything was all 
right. 

Instead, here was a long line of 
uniformed officers, bearing birthday 
cakes to a fifty kiloton atomic 
bomb. 

★ * * 

Birkson had ordered the lights 
turned off in the Leystrasse. When 
his order had not been carried out, 
he broke out the lights with his put- 
ter. Soon, he had some of the offic- 
ers helping him. 

Now the beautiful Leystrasse, the 
pride of New Dresden, was a flick- 
ering tunnel through hell. The light 
of a thousand tiny birthday candles 
on five hundred cakes turned every- 
thing red-orange and made people 
into shadowed demons Officers 
kept arriving with hastily wrapped 
presents, flowers, balloons. Hans, 
the little man who was now nothing 

GALAXY 




but a brain and nerve network float- 
ing in a lead container; Hans, the 
cause of all this, the birthday boy 
himself, watched it all in uncon- 
cealed delight from his battery of 
roving television cameras. He sang 
loudly. 

“I am a bomb! I am a bomb!” 
he yelled. He had never had so 
much fun. 

Bach and Birkson retreated from 
the scene into the darkened recess 
of the Bagatelle Flower Shoppe. 
There, a stereo viewing tank had 
been set up. 

The x-ray picture had been taken 
with a moving plate technique that 
allowed a computer to generate a 
three dimensional model. They 
leaned over the tank now and 
studied it. They had been joined by 
Sergeant McCoy, Bach’s resident 
bomb expert, and another man from 
the Lunar Radiation Laboratory. 

“This is Hans,” said Birkson, 
moving a red dot in the' tank by 
means of a dial on the side. It 
flicked over and around a vague 
gray shape that trailed dozens of 
wires. Bach wondered again at the 
pressures that would allow a man to 
like having his body stripped from 
him. There was nothing in that lead 
flask but the core of the man, the 
brain and central nervous system. 

“Here’s the body of the bomb. 
The two sub-critical masses. The 
H.E. charge, the timer, the arming 
harrier, which is now withdrawn, 
h’s an old design, ladies and gen- 
tlemen. Old, but reliable. As basic 

bagatelle 



as the bow and arrow. It’s very 
much like the first one dropped on 
the Nippon Empire at Hiro-Shima.” 

“You’re sure it’ll go off, then?” 
Bach put in. 

“Sure as taxes. Hell, a kid could 
build one of these in the bathroom, 
given only the uranium and some 
shielding equipment. Now let me 
see.” He pored over the phantom in 
the tank, tracing out wiring paths 
with the experts. They debated pos- 
sibilities, lines of attack, draw- 
backs. At last they seemed to reach 
a consensus. 

“As I see it, we have only one 
option,” Birkson said. “We have to 
go for his volitional control over the 
bomb. I’m pretty sure we’ve iso- 
lated the main cable that goes from 
him to the detonator. Knock that 
out, and he can’t do a thing. We 
can pry that tin can open by con- 
ventional means and disarm that 
way. McCoy?” 

“I agree,” said McCoy. “We’d 
have a full hour, and I’m sure we 
can get in there with no trouble. 
When they cyborged this one, they 
put all their cards on the human 
operator. They didn’t bother with 
entry blocks, since Hans could pre- 
sumably blow it up before we could 
get close enough to do anything. 
With his control out, we only have 
to open it up with a torch and drop 
the damper into place. 

The LRL man nodded his agree- 
ment. “Though I’m not quite as 
convinced as Mr. Birkson that he’s 
got the right cable in mind for what 

25 




he wants to do. If we had more 
time ...” 

‘‘We’ve wasted enough time al- 
ready,” Bach said, decisively. She 
had swung rapidly from near terror 
of Roger Birkson to total trust. It 
was her only defense. She knew she 
could do nothing at all about the 
bomb, and had to trust someone. 

‘‘Then we go for it. Is your crew 
in place? Do they know what to do? 
And above all, are they goodl Re- 
ally good. There won’t be a second 
chance.” 

‘‘Yes, yes, and yes,” Bach said. 
“They’ll do it. We know how to 
cut rock on Luna.” 

“Then give them the coordinates, 
and go.” Birkson seemed to relax a 
bit. Bach saw that he had been 
under some form of tension, even if 
it was only excitement at the chal- 
lenge. He had just given his last or- 
der. It was no longer in his hands. 
His fatalistic gambler’s instinct 
came into play and the restless, 
churning energy he had brought to 
the enterprise vanished. There was 
nothing to do about it but wait. 
Birkson was good at waiting. He 
had lived through twenty-one of 
these final countdowns. 

He faced Bach and started to say 
something to her, then thought bet- 
ter of it. She saw doubt in his face 
for the first time, and it made her 
skin crawl. Damn it, she had 
thought he was sure. 

“Chief,” he said, quietly, “I 
want to apologize for the way I 
treated you these last few hours. It’s 

26 



not something I can control when 
I’m on the job. I . ” 

This time it was Bach’s turn to 
laugh, and the release of tension it 
brought with it was almost orgas- 
mic. She felt like she hadn’t 
laughed for a million years. 

“Forgive me,” she said. “I saw 
you were worried, and thought it 
was about the bomb. It was just 
such a relief.” 

“Oh, yeah,” he said, dismissing 
it. “No point in worrying now. 
Either your people hit it or they 
don’t. We won’t know if they 
don’t. What I was saying, it just 
sort of comes over me. Honestly. I 
get homy, I get manic, I totally 
forget about other people except as 
objects to be manipulated. So I just 
wanted to say I like you. I’m glad 
you put up with me. And I won’t 
pester you anymore.” 

She came over and put her hand 
on his shoulder. 

“Can I call you Roger? Thanks. 
Listen, if' this thing works, I’ll have 
dinner with you. I’ll give you the 
key to the city, a ticker tape parade, 
and a huge bonus for a consultant 
fee . and my eternal friendship. 
We’ve been tense, okay? Let’s 
forget about these last few hours.” 
"All right.” His smile was quite 
different this time. 

Outside, it happened very quick- 
ly. The crew on the laser drill were 
positioned beneath the bomb, work- 
ing from ranging reports and calcu- 
lations to aim their brute at pre- 
cisely the right spot. 



GALAXY 




The beam took less than a tenth 
of a second to eat through the layer 
of rock in the ceiling and emerge in 
the air above the Leystrasse. It ate 
through the metal sheath of the 
bomb’s underside, the critical wire, 
the other side of the bomb, and part 
of the ceiling like they weren’t even 
there. It had penetrated into the 
level above before it could be shut 
off. 

There was a shower of sparks, a 
quick sliding sound, then a muffled 
thud. The whole structure of the 
bomb trembled, and smoke 
screeched from the two drilled holes 
in the top and bottom. Bach didn’t 
understand it, but could see that she 
was alive and assumed it was over. 
She turned to Birkson, and the 
shock of seeing him nearly stopped 
her heart. 

His face was a gray mask, 
drained of blood. His mouth hung 
open. He swayed, and almost fell 
over. Bach caught him and eased 
him to the floor. 

“Roger . what is it? Is it 
still . .will it go off? Answer 
me, answer me. What should I 
do?” 

He waved weakly, pawed at her 
hands. She realized he was trying to 
give her a reassuring pat. It was 
feeble indeed. 

“No danger,” he wheezed, trv- 
ing to get his breath back. “No 
danger. The wrong wire. We hit the 
wrong wire. Just luck, is all, noth- 
ing but luck.” 

She remembered. They had been 

bagatelle 



trying to remove Hans’ control over 
the bomb. Was he still in control? 
Birkson answered before she could 
speak. 

“He’s dead. That explosion. That 
was the detonator going off. He 
reacted just too late. We hit the 
disarming switch. The shield 
dropped into place so the masses 
couldn’t come together even if the 
bomb was set off. Which he did. He 
set it off. That sound, that 
mmmmmmwooooph!" He was not 
with her. His eyes stared back into 
a time and place that held horror for 
him. 

“I heard that sound — the 
detonator — once before, over the 
telephone. I was coaching this 
woman, no more than twenty-five, 
because I couldn’t get there in time. 
She had only three more minutes. I 
heard that sound, then nothing, 
nothing.” 

She sat near him on the floor as 
her crew began to sort out the mess, 
haul the bomb away for disposal, 
laugh and joke in hysterical relief. 
At last Birkson regained control of 
himself. There was no trace of the 
bomb except a distant hollowness in 
his eyes. 

“Come on,” he said, getting to 
his feet with a little help from her. 
“You’re going on twenty-four hour 
leave. You’ve earned it. We’re 
going back to Burning Tree and 
you’re going to watch me make a 
par five on the eighteenth. Then 
we’ve got a date for dinner. What 
place is nice?” ★

VA 1 ' 



Some experiences are 
priceless — but still 
they must be paid for! 



Do YOU REMEMBER how much 
you wanted that bone? How you 
hoped that she would give it to you 
and not toss it into the pot with the 
rest? Maybe she would leave a few 
shreads of meat clinging to it. How 
you pranced, your nails drumming a 
tattoo on the slippery kitchen floor. 
How you wiggled, your tail slap- 
ping quickly back and forth, your 
head bobbing like an idiot. 

She told you to speak. Speak? 
Yes, you did, you spoke and spoke 
and spoke until she patted you on 
your head and ahhh — finally! — 
lowered the bone. You took it in 
your mouth, carefully, not at all too 

YOU'LL BE A REAL SENSATION! 



greedily. It felt hard. It smelled like 
animal. Beast. It was. You felt your 
mouth fill with saliva as you carried 
it proudly outside as she swung 
open the screen door. 

And then? Faster, faster faster 
you trotted until you reached the 
shade of the maple. Then you 
dropped the bone onto the grass. 
Remember how you sniffed it, short 
little sniffs, then deep, long ones? 
Remember your teeth tearing at the 
meat? After cleaning it all off, you 
would thrust the bone as far back 
into your mouth as you could. Re- 
member how your teeth would grind 
down on it, sometimes slipping and 
how, finally, you would shift it to 
another position holding it firmly 
with your paws to gnaw happily 
away once more. 

Remember the taste and feel of 
the bone you had that summer day 
under the maple. Wasn’t it the best 
bone you ever had? Not the 
meatiest, not the biggest, but, all- 
around, the best bone experience. 

Don’t you remember what it was 
like to be a dog? Really? 

That’s odd. 

I do. 

I think I liked it even better than 
finding that cookie crumb on the 
sidewalk as I was just passing the 
third crack. It seemed like a longer 
trek than usual, but oh, brother, 
what a reward! 

I wasn’t one of those who didn’t 
watch what it was doing. I was 
scurrying right along when — you 
really wouldn’t believe it — there it 

29 




was. Almost as big as I was. And it 
was fresh. The biggest chunk of 
anything quite so marvelous I had 
ever found. I had to stop to admire 
it before doing anything about it. 
Think how we would all enjoy it. 
How envious everyone would be 
when they saw me walk into the 
nest canying that. 

It would absolutely stun them to 
think that I, last on the list of food 
gatherers, could have discovered 
such a lode. They would surely 
honor me for weeks to come, 
perhaps append a title to my name. 

But oh! The thing itself. To look 
at that buttery honeysoaked crumb 
and to know it was mine, mine l The 
smell of it — truly I felt faint from 
the richness of this experience. 

Then I set to thinking about how 
best to raise it. I began the task, 
finally shouldering most of it, the 
rest trailing only slightly behind me 
on the ground. 

What? 

Naturally you can’t imagine any- 
thing more terrifying than what 
happened next. 

Of course fear dried my mouth as 
I looked up — and up and up and up. 
I dropped the crumb, my treasure of 
treasures, and tried to run. Out of 
breath at last but quick, quick, 
quick. My legs ached, all of them. 

Would I make it? It was too far, 
too far. The expanse of concrete 
stretched forever. The shadow 
deepened and I threw every ounce 
of energy I had into the last terrible 
sprint. 

30 



The sole of the shoe was almost 
over me. Two of my legs tripped 
and I stumbled. 

The shoe came down. It rolled 
over me and — and? I and my body 
were not. Part. Of. Each. Other. 
Any. More. I know you have al- 
ways. wondered what it would be 
like to squish — and now you know. 

I slid into some dark place and 
wasn’t anything, anymore. 

Did you ever think of yourself as 
sadistic? 

Was that a thriller or not? 

Thorgaad turned to Imgaad when 
it was over. She lay still, with all 
her eye rivlets shut, shudders rip- 
pling her entire surface like seawinds 
the ocean. 

“Wonderful,” she sighed. 
“Wonderful. I just know there’s 
never been anything like it here on 
Hydran. How can I thank you 
Thorgaad? Well — time we were up 
and off to work. Seelgaad will 
simmer and fume if I’m late, but 
then I’m never late.” She flowed 
out of her resting pod and into the 
next chamber. Thorgaad followed 
on her trail. Slimomat-deluxe pad- 
ded along behind them, cleaning 
up. 1 

On the way to work that morn- 
ing, flowing with the rest in a 
steady stream, Imgaad kept her 
thinking separate as best she could 
and tried to decide just how she 
would repay Thorgaad. 

She knew it was expected that 
she do so. But it would take all her 
savings and that probably would not 

GALAXY 




be enough to really outdo him. She 
would check with Nefarian to see 
what was coming in next. 

No big problem, really. Nefarian 
always makes things possible and 
you never have to pay until later. 
To Imgaad’s thinking, later is later 
and now is now and never the twain 
shall meet. She was determined not 
to be the one to lose faces. 

Doublewammy, doublewammy, 
how to swing a doublewammy, a 
really sensational experience. She 
could do it, she would do it and 
Thorgaad would be impressed. 
Points for Imgaad. 

* * Hr 

She need not have worried. 

Everything was bound to work 
out. 

That is, if you’ll just relax. 
Please, try to relax. Now this injec- 
tion isn’t going to hurt. No, not one 
bit. Do you think I would lie to 
you — to you? What good would it 
do? The next time you would not 
trust me at all. And I told you the 
basis ox our relationship is trust. 

Now, breathe deeply, deeply. 
Didn’t you practice your Lemaze? 
Don’t you feel in control of the 
situation? Don’t get hysterical or 
it’s all over. And we can’t have 
that. 

The needle is predatory. It bites 
into the back of the hand, there, 
where the bones are so — vulnerable, 
^d if you turn over, it trails along 
like a sharp toothed earthsnake 

YOU'LL BE A REAL SENSATION! 



whose lone spiked tooth has a 
tenacious hold on you. 

Didn’t you know you can’t wear 
fingernail polish to the hospital? 
Well you know it now in case 
you’re thinking of repeating the ex- 
perience. 

They want to look at your fin- 
gernails. Like some ancient tribal 
medicineman, divining entrails to 
foretell the future, the outcome of 
the whole shebang. You’ll just have 
to take it off. And then they’ll take 
off your unpublic hair, shave it off 
to a bare little fleshy mound with 
the goosebumpy look of a plucked 
chicken. 

They’re clearing the decks for 
battle. 

You’re the ship, ungainly ship. 

Ohhhhh, oweee, that’s sharp, a 
good one. It makes you gasp. 
What’s that stomach doing? Gro- 
tesque, undulating, heaving, first like 
a malignantly overblown marshmal- 
low, then taut as a watermelon. 

The nurse is a dearsoul and she’s 
in her element; she used to work at 
Buchenwald. She wants to take off 
your contact lenses. That’s the rule. 
You say it’s your rule that you be 
able to see, to defend yourself — 
what would you do without your 
sight ? 

She insists. 

She comes closer. 

If you shut your eyes, really 
tightly, how will she ever get them 
out? Will she pry your eyes open 
and gouge them out? Is — are — there 
any rules that say she has to leave 

31 




your eyes intact, capable of seeing? 
The rule is that you can not wear 
your contact lenses here. 

Help-help, somebody come and 
beat that woman away from here. 
Grab a broom, swing a lamp, but 
get her away. 

The battle is postponed; her 
beeper calls her elsewhere. 

Ponderously you move onto your 
left side, panting at the effort, the 
snake following. Your stomach is 
so distended that you hope that you 
don’t droop over the edge of the 
hard, narrow bed. Will such weight 
in one spot tip the balance and pull 
you over the side. Would you burst 
there like a much-too-ripe can- 
taloup? 

Contractions are zipping right- 
along. The magic in the IV bottle is 
dripping, dripping, down the in- 
nards of the snake, out its fang and 
into your poor defenseless bony 
hand. 

Whooooooeeee. This isn’t any 
fun at all. 

Now it’s more fun. Remember 
when you were constipated from 
eating all those apples when your 
parents left you for a week? You 
could not move a thing and were 
threatened by your pinch-nosed aunt 
with Mineral Oil and Worse if you 
didn’t Move Them. 

What business was it of hers? 
Only that at her house she liked 
things done right, on schedule. 
And, besides, you had to realize 
that you could obtain some dread 
disease, generated right there in the 

32 



lower portions of your — ah — trunk. 
And if you didn’t get rid of what 
you had, poor thing, what would 
you do with what was coming ? 
Where would the next load of com, 
boiled potatoes and stringy potroast 
go? You know you can’t waste be- 
cause of the starving of India. So it 
would pile up and up and up and 
finally you would rupture, surely 
pop, from the sheer volume of it 
all. 

So — go to it. Take your Little 
Lulu or whatever else you want into 
the john and get to work. Such 
work, seemingly without reward. 
Grunt, groan, great-god-in-heaven, 
something will split asunder before 
that long hard brown beast finally 
makes its way out. 

The final minute. Ah, relief. Re- 
joicing, primeval, infantile glee at 
having mastered The Art. Take it to 
Auntie? No? No. But she ordered 
you to call her because she wanted 
to see for herself you’d done it. 

The Divulging of the Goods. 
Yes, that was — and is — it. 

They? re all standing around, now, 
the bunch of them, as the Snake 
sends its Pitocin into your vital bodi- 
ly fluids to send you writhing and 
breathless into the Delivery Room. 

Deliverance, oh. A masked cabal. 

Push, they order. Push you 
primipara. 

He has a mask, she has a mask, 
all of god's chillin have masks. 
Where is your mask? 

The light is so bright. You don’t 
need such an intense illumination 



GALAXY 




you realize, unless — is this grand 
opening being televised ? 

That one! Mr. Bloodgut the 
Butcher. His instruments are all 
lined up and polished. Meet the 
meat. The meat is you. 

Why ramble, mind? They said 
they wouldn’t give you anything. 
Maybe just a little something? 

The masked and the unmasked 
glare at each other. Are they trying 
to keep their germs away from you? 
You can’t imagine kindness. Are 
the little bastards in their nasal pas- 
sages fighting to get out and at you? 
Or do these people prize them 
highly and will be damned if they’ll 
let any one escape. 

Gimme a mask, you snarl po- 
litely, Why should l do without? 
Could they want your germs to stay 
away from them? Will they mask 
the infant when it gets here? How 
could they possibly know, the 
sneaks, that you didn’t mouth-wash 
before commencing labor? 

You, the carrier of something un- 
speakable. Lethal? All must be pro- 
tected, shielded. What, what, what? 

The answer escapes. 

Masques: disguises. Ha, not one 
is what he seems. Look at the eyes 
above the maks, eyes are the key, 
the clue. That one was once a rat 
before attending medical school. 
Such beady little eyes, such a lean 
and pointed nose. He’s wearing a 
mask to hide his rat whiskers. 

Sure. Understanding triumphant. 
If that lady from Buchenwald, 
there, had not strapped your arms 

YOU'LL BE A REAL SENSATION!

down at your sides with those 
brown leather restraints, they know 
you’d rip their masks off and all 
would be revealed for the world to 
see. The Jewish Nazi-sleuth from 
Vienna would come and get you 
Buchenwaldhilda. None of you 
wants the truth and pictures plas- 
tered all over the papers, you think. 

They are making preparations. 

To do something with you, to 
you, if you don’t mind — and even if 
you do. 

They want to get at it. Spiteful 
primipara, why hold up the works? 
Why refuse to deliver the goods? 
That one, there: it must be Auntie. 
Take off your mask, woman. We 
know why you’ve come. 

I’m trying to push it out, you 
pant. Hold the mineral oil. Sheath 
your instruments. 

Whooopee! Almost. 

A little more. A little more. 

More and more and more and 
more. 

Somewhere down the hall some 
woman is screaming her guts out. 

Would it help to yell bloody 
murder? 

Let’s just forget the human race. 

Human race? 

Like long distance race? 

The quarter-mile race? 

The race against famine? 

The race against time? 

What the hell, let’s forget the 
human race and do something else. 

No. Not possible. Stop it! Let me 
float and suck my thumb. Swim a 
little, bounce a little, turn a little.

Dark and warm and free from harm. 
Happy days and happy nights. I 
love to twirliewhirlie with the cord, 
like jumpidy-rope. Sloshing and roll- 
ing and rocking. I grab my cordi- 
ken, thick, thick cordiken and pull 
but not too hard: it pulses in the 
warm; it feeds me good. 

Sometimes I wonder, but not of- 
ten. 

Usually what I like to do is move 
my meee. This and that a way, punch 
and pirouette, ram and butt-butt-butt 
soft walls that bind and love me all 
the livelongday. 

I am meee and nobody else; even 
from the beginning I was and am. 

What are they doing to my meee? 
Squeezing, pressing, pushing. I 
can’t turn ’round and I am heading 
down, down. My head presses there 
and it hurts. 

How can I fit through that stingy 
gap? I can go no further. My wa- 
tery has gone sluuurp, gush, away, 
before me in a rush and. And? 

On and on and on but so 
slowly-oh. 

My head explodes. Something 
hard has got it. Claws, yes. I can 
not see. It pulls me, drags me, 
crushes my soft little headiken. 

Blind? I never thought so there, 
but now? What is this unhome un- 
dark place? 

. It has me now. Holding me up by 
my footie, jerk! My back so long so 
curved and cushioned, feels like it 
is snapping at each little knob and 
cleavage. 

It hangs me upside down, swing- 
GALAXY 




ing, my head throbbing, my skin 
cold and drying. 

I am dying. Don’t you know? 

Feel for me. 

They are killing my meee, you, 
us. 

It is hitting my back. 

I scream. 

They are happy that I scream and 
I scream some more and at last it 
lets me down. 

And they have taken away my 
twirliecordie, cut it off. 

I scream some more because they 
like it and maybe let me be. 

Even with my eyes clenched shut 
the light is too much, too much. 

I want to go home. Home. Back. 

But you must know that you can 
never go home. 

You are absolutely exhausted, 
both of you. Mother and child, in- 
fant so tender and mild and, 
motherdear you did like we knew 
you could. 

Neither of you remember all of 
that? 

Strange, what a pity, what a 
waste. 

I remember for you and we can 
do it again. 

Think how lucky we are to share 
such an experience. How is your 
baby, Thorgaad? 

“What do you mean, my baby. I 
am the baby. Also.” 

“Such an intense and moving ex- 
perience, Thorgaad. Shall we rec- 
ommend it to our friends? Or 
claim an exclusive?” 

“Imgaad, did you go to that 

YOU'LL BE A REAL SENSATION! 



Nefarian for this? How much did 
you pay?’ ’ 

“Don’t you splash at me like 
that, Thorgaad, you have no right. I 
will not be beholden to you. What 
did I promise Nefarian? Anything 
he wanted. ’-’ 

“Anything he wanted?’’ Thor- 
gaad rose in a wave and spilled to 
where she dripped. “I can tell by 
your dripping that way that you are 
hiding something from me. Now: 
What is it, Imgaad?” 

“Nothing. I had to promise Nefa- 
rian anything to get what I got for 
you, us. He promised me that he 
has never been able to offer such an 
exciting doublewammy, such an in- 
tense experience, to any Gaad on 
Saternia. I was bidding against 
twelve others for the experience.” 
She waited for his comment. “It 
was a real masterpiece, Thorgaad. 
How often is it that you can experi- 
ence a real Masterpiece?’ ’ 

She was dripping faster now, part 
of her had puddled by the pod. 
Thorgaad became alarmed. She 
must be more than nervous, she 
must be distraught. “ What did you 
promise, Imgaad?” 

“I told you — anything he 
wants.” 

“Which is?” 

“I don’t know. He didn’t say 
what he wanted.” 

Thorgaad pulled himself together, 
pulsating, pouring jerkily from one 
side of the chamber to the other. 
“I’m beginning to think that this 
whole operation of Nefarian’s 

36 



should be banned on this planet. I 
propose we send a dribble to that 
effect to the protectorate.” 

“How could you live without 
your sensations, Thorgaad?” Im- 
gaad wept, untidy drops spattering 
the floor by her. “It’s the only 
thing that keeps you separate, that 
makes you you. Otherwise you’d 
just be part of the common stream. 
Melded, welded, blended — washing 
and flowing together are we, com- 
mon parts of a common tide. That’s 
all you or I had ever been until 
Nefarian arrived.” 

She sighed. “Maybe I shouldn’t 
have promised him anything, but 
there was no other way to get it. A 
one of a kind, he promised. Be- 
sides,” she said, “You know I’d 
rather dry than accept charity.” 

You, there, surely remember how 
it was. Chewing together, squishing 
together, birthing both of us to- 
gether. Some never share an experi- 
ence like that in a whole planet’s 
turn, or, even, ever. 

* * * 

I know you are feeling for Thor- 
gaad and Imgaad. Who could help 
it? 

What happened to the chamber? 
Who knows? 

Could the tragedy have been 
avoided? 

Yes, I know you feel it was the 
worst thing that could happen to a 
Gaad. 



GALAXY 




Shall I help your memory, just a 
little? 

First you surely recall you were 
all set to leave the chamber. What a 
let-down the day would be after The 
Experience. Credit was no longer 
valid with Nefarian since you had 
mortgaged to him anything he 
wanted. 

Was it Nefarian who was respon- 
sible for jamming the door? And 
Nefarian who made the windows 
stick? So there was no way you 
could leak out? 

When the suns came out, it be- 
came clear we were all in for the 
hottest day in planetspans — yes, it 
will surely be recorded so in all the 
history tapes for the future. 

Recall how quiet the chamber 
was? Such efficient sound insula- 
tion. 

You tried the communicator. 
Maybe they hadn’t turned it off, 
yet, as they had threatened. A 
shame you had used all your tokens 
for your wild experiences and 
hadn’t paid your utilities. 

“Harkenharkenharken,” you 
bubbled into the transcommunicator. 
“Emergency, emergency.” 

‘‘You may pay your bill at the 
highgully station during the hours of 
duskcool and your communicator 
services will be restored,” the re- 
cording simpered. 

Warmer, even wanner. 

Hotter, even hotter. 

You looked at each other. There 
'J'as less left. Should you combine? 
Maybe you could make it until the 

y OU'LL BE A REAL SENSATION! 



suns went down. Such a decision. 
A blending for all time it would 
mean, if you managed to survive 
the heat. You were too tacky, too 
thick, to ever be pulled apart at this 
state. 

How horrifying to see first a little 
of one, then the other, turn to 
steam, then disappear into the plas- 
ter of the ceiling and walls. Less 
and less. Oh, the sensation was the 
more poignant because your inten- 
tions had been so good. Brave 
Thorgaad, giving your Imgaad the 
experiences of lifetimes she could 
never live. And the Honor of Im- 
gaad, repaying doubly over with the 
finest doublewammy Nefarian had 
offered, ever, to Hydran. 

And now? Isn’t it becoming dif- 
ficult even to think? The outlines of 
the chamber are vague, smeary. 
You are both boiling down to a 
thick, sticky ichor, clinging to the 
central pod. Imgaad, there is just 
enough flow left for you to reach 
your beloved one. So, Thorgaad, 
strong Thorgaad, stretch — stretch ! 
Yes, like that. Trickle, trickle, you 
can do it — of course it is hard when 
you’re so viscous. But that too is a 
new sensation, heywhat? Almost 
there now, ooze a bit more — you, 
too, Imgaad. 

Will we ever be able to be recon- 
stituted, Thorimgaad? 

I must admit, truthfully, that it is 
doubtful. 

You said you wo.uld rather dry 
than accept charity. And so you 
have. 



37 




Such a sweet but bitter experi- 
ence, don’t you think? 

Do you think old Nefarian should 
be kicked off the planet Hydran 
because he delivers what his cus- 
tomers want? 

* * * 

“Nefarian, you rascal, you did 
those poor things in just to make a 
fast buck here on dementia!” The 
plant waved its leafy tentacles at the 
timetrader, “Excuse me, Nefarian, 
while I bloom.” The giant plant 
huffed and puffed and voila! it was 
covered with cow-sized flowers, 
red, velvety, like double gladioli. 

Nefarian waited until the most in- 
tense of the plant’s parfume had 
been wafted elsewhere by the 
winds. “Once you have bloomed, 
Clemintinien, you know you’re re- 
ally going to be tied down. So 
many responsibilities you’ll have 
from now through harvest.” 

The Plant shrugged. “I know. 
The blooming is something ev- 
eryone should experience, but the 
time between that and fruitdrop is a 
drag. Routine, dull — if there were 
only some way to break it. At least 
I’ll have the Gaad experience to 
think about.” 

“You can have more than that, 
much more. You’ve already paid in 
full, just for letting me watch you 
bloom. And promising me some 
fruit from your next dropping. I 
know you know how valuable it is 

38 



elsewhere. It’ll be a real novelty of 
course, but may become one of the 
most sought-after items on my 
route.” Nefarian stroked one of the 
flowers. It pushed toward him like a 
cat when petted. 

“Let me ask you, first, Cleminti- 
nien, if you didn’t think the Gaads 
were sensational. Yes? You know, I 
have others, a plethora of diversions 
which can make this fruiting the 
best time of your life. Price? Why 
ask. We can come to an agreeable 
solution between now and your next 
bloom. Can I ask you? It looked so 
easy, the way you did it — ” 

“Oh it was, this time,” the Plant 
agreed, rustling its flowers provoca- 
tively. “But sometimes you 
wouldn’t believe the complica- 
tions.” 

Nefarian smiled his many under- 
standing smiles. 

“There is someone somewhere 
who could believe it. / could be- 
lieve it,” the timetrader said. 

Perhaps you have never wondered 
what would happen if the Venebees 
refused to pollinate your Etrusian 
stamen. No? Beyond belief! Try to 
imagine: surely no where in the 
universe, is there such pain, an- 
guish, suspense as to what will 
happen. 

And then, when the Venebees 
come — what excitation, what joy, a 
resurrection and more. To know, 
you must become. 

Worth your while ? No, worth 
your life. Would Nefarian lie to 
you? ★

FUSION WITHOUT EXLAX 



If a man told you “The only 
physics I ever took was Ex-Lax,” 
would you put him in charge of 
nuclear power policy? 

That’s not a trick question. The 
founder of the California People’s 
Lobby once said it, and he was the 
architect of the Nuclear Shutdown 
Initiatives. 

I’ve started this column four 
times, and I’m still not happy. The 
problem is this: I want Galaxy 
readers to support a research project 
I’ll tell you about shortly, but I 
don’t want to add to mythology; 
and the project involves fusion. 

There’s the rub. Alas, “fusion” 
has in all too many places and for 
all too many people become an in- 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



cantation, a magical formula which, 
when uttered, ends all rational de- 
bate about power policies. 

In fact, the situation is worse 
than that: “fusion” is a good word, 
and fusion scientists are white 
magicians: “fission” is evil, and 
its supporters have made deals with 
Satan to loose the evil djinn 
Plutonium onto this world. In these 
days when our representatives have 
shunted off primary responsibility 
for power policy decisions onto the 
general public, it’s important — at 
least to me — that the public deals in 
physics, not myth. 

Now science fiction readers, un- 
like the Ex-Lax expert, are seldom 
proud, of ignorance; indeed, from 

39 



the letters I get, and the audience 
response during my lectures, the 
opposite is true, SF readers often 
know very much more about 
technology than the general public 
does — and yet are often conscien- 
tious enough not to get into the de- 
bates, because they know enough to 
convince them they’ve no right to 
fixed opinions. That’s admirable, 
but it may prove disastrous: carried 
to an extreme the trend means that 
only the opinionated and truly ig- 
norant have a voice. 

Therefore: I want to plug 

electron-beam fusion research; but I 
want your informed support, and 
since I know, again from my lecture 
tours, that an awful lot of people 
don’t really understand either fission 
or fusion, I’m going to start with 
the basics. My apologies to those 
who find this discussion elementary. 
I will try, for the benefit of those 
whose only physics are Ex-Lax but 
who don’t boast about that, to keep 
this reasonably simple. 

* * * 

E - me 2 , saith Einstein; that is, 
mass (m) can be converted into 
energy (E). To be precise, energy in 
ergs equals converted mass, in 
grams, times the square of the 
speed of light in centimeters per 
second. Light-speed (c) is 3 x 10 10 
cm/sec, so converting a gram of 
mass to energy would yield 10 21 
ergs, something like 100 kilotons, 
or about 100 times as much energy 

40 



in all forms as the average used by 
each person in the U.S. last year. 

The equation says nothing about 
how that energy comes out. A mo- 
ment’s thought will show you that 
can be important. If it all comes out 
as neutrinos it won’t do us much 
good. There’s no way to catch 
them. If it comes out as protons or 
electrons, we’re in good shape: 
they’re charged particles, and we 
can pass them through a ceramic 
tube with coils of wire around it to 
get electricity directly. (That last 
trick is called magneto- 
hydrodynamics, (MHD) and it’s a 
bit more complex than it sounds; 
but we know how to do it. It only 
takes energetic charged particles.) 

Unfortunately, most nuclear reac- 
tions do not produce charged parti- 
cles. A great deal of nuclear energy 
appears as neutrons, and we can’t 
catch them in a magnetic basket. 
What we can do is put something in 
their way. They get slowed down, 
or stopped, and their kinetic energy 
is converted into heat. We extract 
that heat, use it to boil water, and 
put the water through turbines. The 
turbine neither knows nor cares 
where the heat came from; it’s ail 
the same to it whether the heat 
source was burning coal, fissioning 
Uranium, or fusing Hydrogen. 

The turbine system is the most 
efficient thing we’ve got for turning 
heat into electricity; but it’s not 
100% efficient and never will be, 
nor will anything else, including 
MHD. Thus let’s dispell the first 

GALAXY 




myth about fusion: it may be margin- 
ally more efficient than either fos- 
sil energy or fission, but it will still 
have waste heat, and will still re- 
quire cooling systems. No one re- 
ally knows the effective operating 
temperatures of fusion devices — we 
haven’t even got anything that 
works in a laboratory yet — but if we 
assume they’ll be hotter than either 
coal or fission, fusion systems will 
be somewhat more efficient than 
those we’ve got; but not all that 
much more so. Known efficiencies 
for fossil and fission plants, and as- 
sumed ones for fusion plants, are 
given in Table One. 

Fission systems work thusly: a 
neutron source is brought near an 
atom that breaks apart. Neutrons are 
emitted. Other atoms are broken 
into lighter elements and more neu- 
trons. Some of the additional neu- 
trons axe used to break up even more 
atoms (chain reaction), others are 
allowed to bombard useless stuff 
like Uranium-238 and turn it into 



useful stuff like Plutonium-239, and 
the rest are caught for their heat 
energy. 

Fusion goes the other way. If you 
squeeze hydrogen atoms together 
and get them hot enough, they turn 
into helium. The resulting helium 
doesn’t mass quite as much as the 
original hydrogen: result, energy. It 
sounds simple, and it is. This is the 
reaction that powers the Sun. Unfor- 
tunately, we don’t know how to do 
it, and we may never learn. Cer- 
tainly we haven’t even a theoretical 
clue as to how to bring off stellar 
fusion; the temperatures and pres- 
sures involved are plain beyond us. 

So, we go to the next best thing 
and use Deuterium, which we’ll call 
“D”. There are two reactions: 

D + D-»T + p + 3.25 MeV 
(22,000 kW- hr/gram) Eq. 1 
and 

D + D — > 3 He 2 + n + 4 MeV 
(27,000 kW-hr/gram) Eq. 2 and I’d 
better explain what all that means 
before I lose someone.

A STEP FARTHER OUT 









41 




First, Deuterium is “heavy” hy- 
drogen. Ordinary hydrogen atoms 
have one proton tp) and one elec- 
tron (e), and nothing else. D has an 
additional neutron (n); it could be 
written as 2 Hi where the left 
superscript is the atomic weight, H 
is the symbol for hydrogen, and the 
right subscript is the atomic 
number. 

Tritium, (T), is “superheavy” 
hydrogen with 2 neutrons, and 
could be written 3 Hi. By the same 
token, 3 He 2 is “light” helium; 
normal helium is 4 He 2 , and this 
stuff is missing a neutron. 

For reasons we won’t worry 
about here, it’s convenient to mea- 
sure nuclear energies in Millions of 
electron Volts (MeV), and I’ve 
given the textbook figures; for our 
purposes, though, the kiloWatt- 
hours per gram of material fused is 
more relevant. For comparison, a 
regular 100- Watt lightbulb will use 
876 kW-hr each year if left burning; 
obviously a 1000-Watt heater uses 1 
kW-hr each hour. A kW-hr of elec- 
tric power costs between 1.2 and 50 
to generate, and is sold to the con- 
sumer for from 20 to a dime (al- 
though I understand that lawsuits, 
strikes, and interesting administra- 
tive methods have got New Yorkers 
paying about 200/kW-hr). 

The two reactions shown are 
equally probable. Both go on at the 
same time, and there’s no known 
way to favor one over the other. 

The Tritium and “light” helium 
can themselves be made to react 

42 



with more D, as follows: 

D + T 4 He 2 + n + 17.6 MeV 
(94,000 kW-hr/gram) Eq 3 
and 

D + 3 He2 — » 4 He2 + p 4- 18.3 
MeV (98,000 kW-hr/gram) Eq 4 
and I’m not giving these equations 
just to show off. Look at them a 
moment. 

First, note that Tritium. It’s 
radioactive with a half-life of 12 
years. We can bum up most of it 
with the eq. 3 reaction, but we’ve 
got to keep it from getting into the 
atmosphere. It’s in the same situa- 
tion as Plutonium: a useful product 
that we need for power; and it 
should suffer the same fate as 
Plutonium, “burning” in a nuclear 
reactor. Until it is “burned” 
though, it’s one of the hazards of 
the power system, and there’s no 
way to change that. 

Second, note those neutrons. 
They must be caught if we’re to 
extract their energy. W'hen neutrons 
hit other atoms, they produce 
radioactive isotopes. Clever design 
can minimize the number of truly 
dangerous radioactive waste prod- 
ucts, but can never eliminate them 
entirely. Thus the fusion industry 
will need nuclear waste-disposal, 
and there goes myth Number Two. 
True: fusion is cleaner than fission 
power systems; but it is not that 
much cleaner. 

Third, the fuel isn’t free. We 
can’t use ordinary hydrogen; we 
have to extract the D from it, and 
that takes energy; thus, at first, fu- 

galaxy 




sion plants will consume more 
energy than they produce — just as, 
for the first years of their lives, fis- 
sion plants haven’t produced the 
energy it took to refine their fuels, 
or coal plants the energy it took to 
mine the coal. All will, of course, 
show a net energy profit after two 
or three years. 

And finally there’s the real prob- 
lem: we don’t know how to do it. 
The basic equations for Uranium 
fission were known for a long time 
before Fermi built his “pile” in the 
squash court of the University of 
Chicago, and nature was very 
cooperative anyway: the materials 
needed for Fermi’s experiment were 
cheap, easily available, and simply 
fabricated; the instrumentation was 
standard; and the control system 
was uncomplicated. Despite the 
ease with which Fermi demonstrated 
the feasibility of self-sustained con- 
trolled fission (it worked first time), 
it took twenty years to get usable 
power from a fission reactor. 

There’s no reason to believe the 
engineering of a practical fusion 
power plant will take less time; and 
we are not yet to the squash court. 
We don’t know that we can do it at 
all — and we’re certainly a long way 
from running our TV sets on elec- 
tricity produced by fusing D. I have 
never found an expert who believes 
we will have a working commercial 
fusion power plant in this century. 
The only people who say different 
are not in the game — and many 
have very large axes to grind. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



“Waiting for fusion” is simply not 
a feasible power policy. There goes 
the fourth myth. 

Depressing, isn’t it? 

Cheer up. First, we don’t need 
fusion. There are other ways to 
power our industrial civilization; 
other ways to spark the Third Indus- 
trial Revolution. We can all get rich 
even if controlled fusion never 
works. That ought to be good news. 
Here are some methods. 

* * * 

First, my favorite, the ocean- 
thermal system, which makes use of 
the temperature difference between 
warm surface water and cold bottom 
water. There’s more than enough 
power in the Tropics to run the 
world, the Sun renews it constantly, 
and we know it will work because a 
working plant was built in 1928. 
However, my engineering friends 
tell me that’s the hard way; and we 
aren’t likely to have operating 
ocean-thermal systems before the 
year 2000 anyway. 

So what are some other ways? 
Here’s where I get into trouble. The 
easiest way of all is one we have 
now: good old reliable (average 
nuclear plant operates 9 mos. each 
year; fossil, 8.2 mos. each year) 
nuclear fission. It already works, 
and we’ve already mined enough 
potential fuel to last us several 
hundred years; moreover, there’s 
enough U-238 in ordinary rock to 

43 




operate the world high-energy 
economy for millenia. 

Alas, that takes breeder reactors, 
and they’re controversial. They 
make Plutonium, and everyone 
knows that Plutonium is “the most 
toxic material known to man.” 
Ralph Nader has told us so. Of 
course Ralph Nader is also the man 
who, with fanfare, bought a manual 
rather than an electric typewriter 
“to conserve energy”. My electric 
uses the electricity generated by 
about a quarter of a cup of oil each 
year; if everybody, all 230 million 
of us, had an electric typer going 
they’d consume a few thousand bar- 
rels of oil annually: not very much 
in an economy that measures oil 
consumption in millions of barrels a 
day. Maybe we ought to take a 
closer look at some of the other 
things Mr. Nader says. His heart’s 
in the right place, but he doesn’t 
seem able to do much quantitative 
thinking. 

Toxicity of Plutonium compared 
to other substances is shown in 
Table Two. Now we don’t spread 



much botulin around the landscape, 
but we do spray crops with arsenic 
tri-oxide; in fact, we today import 
10 times as much arsenic as we’d 
have nuclear wastes if the entire US 
electric system were run on nuclear 
fission. Now I keep telling myself 
that I am NOT going to write a 
paper in defense of nuclear fission 
power; that it’s a political matter; 
but dammit, at least the public de- 
bates ought to make sense. It’s one 
thing seriously and soberly to de- 
bate the advantages and disadvan- 
tages of fission over fossil fuel; but 
it’s quite another to have such an 
important issue decided by mythol- 
ogy and demonology. 

One last thing, then: nuclear 
wastes are radioactive. There. That 
ought to end the debate. Surely no 
one wants “nuclear pollution”. If I 
sound sarcastic, my apologies; 
somebody really and truly said that 
to me not long ago. Meant it, too; 
and she was an important political 
party official. 

So let’s look at radioactivity in 
quantitative terms. Table Three

shows the dose in millirems 
(thousandths of a rem) received by 
each US citizen on the average. 
Further, let’s add a couple bits of 
information: of the 24,000 survivors 
exposed to 140 rems (140,000 
mrem) at Hiroshima-Nagasaki, 
fewer than 200 hundred died of 
cancer. The probability of develop- 
ing cancer from radiation exposure 
is about 0.018% per rem (not 
mrem). 

At this point in my lectures 
someone generally says, loudly, 
“sabotage!” Nuclear plants are vul- 
nerable to that, aren’t they? Well, 
yes; but not very. The 4" steel and 
concrete containment is designed to 
take an aircraft crashing into it 
without rupture. Anyone stealing 



nuclear fuels for terror purposes has 
set himself a pretty suicidal task, 
will need vast technological re- 
sources, and won’t get very many 
people fast — what’s the point of 
threatening people with an increased 
probability of cancer 15 years after 
you set off your infernal device? 
Plastique will do a more spectacular 
job. 

In other words, if we’re going to 
debate power policy, let’s do it 
right, with comparisons of risks, not 
scare statements. I’m willing; if 
you’re interested, my lecture fees 
aren’t too high, and you can get me 
through this magazine. Be prepared 
to pay expenses. 

This has taken us a long way 
from fusion, hasn’t it? No; because

fusion, like other power systems, 
needs to be discussed in context. I 
will not recommend fusion research 
as a magic remedy for the world’s 
ills. 

I do recommend it, though. For 
all its disadvantages, fusion will be, 
if it works, the power system of the 
future. 

First, it’s very fuel-efficient. If 
we can extract all the energy from 
our D, we get an average of about 
100,000 kW-hr/gram, which is 4 
times the energy per gram obtained 
by fission reactors, and ten million 
times the energy/gram from burning 
fossil fuels. A few thousand metric 
tons of D each year could power the 
world. 

Second, the fuel’s not hard to 
get. There is about one atom of D 
for every 6,000 atoms of ordinary 
hydrogen. The world’s D supply 
could come from under fifty plants 
with water intake valves ten to 
twenty feet in diameter. By world’s 
energy supply, I mean the equiva- 
lent of some 20 billion barrels of oil 
a day — more than enough to let 
Ralph Nader have a new Selectric. 

Third, we can never run out of 
D. There are billions of cubic 
kilometers of water on this Earth, 
and at a cubic kilometer each year 
we’d be able to run a long time; nor 
would we, as I’ve heard someone 
say, “lower the oceans”; at least 
not more than an atomic diameter or 
two. 

Fourth, fusion is certainly prefer- 
able to fission: the waste- 

46 



management problem is much sim- 
pler. There are fewer long-term 
radioactive wastes to worry about. 
Although we can and will (and al- 
ready have) shipped tons of 
Plutonium around without anyone 
being injured, the stuff is unpleas- 
ant, and we’d be better off without 
it even if fusion won’t eliminate all 
nuclear wastes. 

So how do we do it? There are 
two major theories on how fusion 
plants might work. First, remember 
that the goal is extremely high tem- 
peratures and pressures. You can’t 
contain them in a material object, 
because either your reaction melts 
your container, or your container 
cools off the D and prevents the 
reaction. Thus non-material con- 
finement systems, which means in 
practice Magnetic Confinement. The 
lion’s share of all fusion research 
goes to that. The problems are 
hairy: both engineering and scien- 
tific questions remain unanswered. 

The equipment is huge, complex, 
and (need I say it?) costly. There 
are blind alleys. We had stel- 
lerators, and magnetic rings, and 
various kinds of pinch-bottles, and 
every one of them failed. It isn’t 
that they weren’t worth building, 
understand; we have learned a lot 
about magnetohydrodynamic stabil- 
ity of plasmas (there’s a buzz 
phrase for you). The current ap- 
proach is a device called a tokamak, 
and if you need to know more about 
those go to your nearest library. 
Magnetic confinement isn’t ex- 

GALAXY 




pected to produce fusion neutrons 
for another ten years, and few think 
it will, even in the laboratory, pro- 
duce more power than it consumes 
before 1990. It gets plenty of fund- 
ing. 

The second approach is called In- 
ertial Confinement. This consists of 
taking small pellets of D, or a D 
and T mixture, and zapping them 
with lots of energy. The zapping 
has to be done just right. If you’re 
not careful, too much zapping 
energy gets inside the pellet and 
tends to disrupt it before fusion can 
take place. There are other failure 
mechanisms, such as lopsided zaps, 
and not enough zap power. 

Inertial confinement has this ad- 
vantage: it is pretty certain to work. 
That is, the problems are more en- 
gineering than scientific. It may 
never work usefully, but it almost 
has to work if we get the geometry 
right and shoot enough power to the 
pellets. It has a second advantage: 
the equipment is much cheaper (for 
laboratory demonstraliqn reactors; 
not necessarily for a working com- 
mercial power generating system). 
Thus Inertial Confinement gets 
about 10% of the fusion research 
budget. 

There are two branches of Inertial 
Confinement: laser (photon) bom- 
bardment, and particle bombard- 
ment. Of the research money in in- 
ertial confinement, 90% or more 
S«es to laser systems. There’s a rea- 
son for that: laser bombardment 
just may have produced fusion al-

ready. There was some fanfare a 
few years ago when KMS Inc., a 
private company, seemed to have 
obtained fusion neutrons. There’s 
still some question about just what 
KMS did or did not achieve, but 
most fusion people believe that laser 
bombardment will eventually work 
out. Right now they’re looking at 
different kinds of lasers, and may 
have to invent a new one (called 
Brand X Laser) which will zap the 
pellet with enough energy, yet 
won’t penetrate the pellet too fast. I 
don’t know whether laser inertial 
confinement gets enough money or 
not, but I suspect they do. 



47 





Comes now (finally!) the point of 
this column. On a recent lecture 
tour I visited Sandia Laboratories (a 
government-owned non-profit cor- 
poration) in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico. I went through their labs, 
and I spent a good bit of time talk- 
ing with Gerald Yonas, the fusion 
project manager. I came away a be- 
liever. 

Sandia is the only place that is 
trying electron bombardment in an 
inertial confinement system. Their 
current budget is about five million 
dollars a year for that research. 
That, in my judgment, is peanuts: 
especially in view of growing evi- 
dence that electron bombardment 
may be the way to go. Sandia may, 
just may, have caught the brass 
ring. 

Why do I say this? Well, first, 
the Soviets are trying electron bom- 
bardment, and they claim to have 
produced about 10® fusion neutrons 
in each reaction. That claim is open 
to some doubt. Official American 
reaction is “Congratulations!”, and, 
in private, the comment “That may 
put them a few months ahead of 
us”. Very private reaction from 
many US experts is more sceptical. 
The bombardment process itself 
produces about 10 s neutrons. Now, 
’tis true there’s a way to tell fusion 
neutrons from other neutrons; but it 
takes very sophisticated instrumenta- 
tion, and many doubt the Soviets 
have it. Then too, the Soviets pro- 
duced their announcement as part of 
the 25th Party Congress shindig, 

48 



and gave absolutely no technical de- 
tails, which is suspicious. For all 
that, no one would be that surprised 
to find that the Russians have in- 
deed brought it off. After all, we 
expect to within a year. 

★ ★ ★ 

I have watched a man spend four 
billion dollars an hour on electric- 
ity. It made him unhappy. He 
wanted to spend a trillion an hour. 
It happened at Sandia labs: they 
were zapping a pellet with elec- 
trons. Of course they didn’t spend 
four billion bucks an hour for very 
long: a few nano-seconds, to be 
exact, so the total cost of the elec- 
tricity was a few dollars; but if they 
could have kept it up! 

The Sandia equipment is impres- 
sive. It’s also massive, as you’d ex- 
pect, considering that they handle 
millions of volts. To get that they 
have to charge up enormous capaci- 
tance systems. Sirens wail, red 
lights flash, needles crawl across 
dials, just like in a good science fic- 
tion movie, and finally the techni- 
cian puts his fingers in his ears. I 
didn’t, in time, and the noise of a 
couple of mega-joules arcing into a 
target is not easily forgotten. 

Even so, it’s not enough. That’s 
what costs the money: building 
equipment that will handle those 
voltages without breakdown (and 
breakdowns are spectacular around 
there; I didn’t see one, but I saw in- 

GALAXY 




sulators the size of a desk with 
inch-deep gouges burned into 
them). Then there’s the triggering 
problem: that system has to dis- 
charge ail its energy at the right 
time, and the right time is measured 
in billionths of a second. It’s amaz- 
ing that they can do it; but they 
can. I saw it done. Incidentally, the 
voltage amplifier systems they use 
are called Marx generators, which 
gives rise to a number of puns, 
political jokes and worse; when they 
were ready to fire someone shouted 
“Harpo’s ready!” and another man 
said “Stand by to fire Groucho.” 
Then there was the zap! and a mil- 
lion joules flowed for a few nano- 
seconds. 

Mega-joules. A joule is 10 7 ergs. 
I was duly impressed until we got 
to talking after the experiment. The 
reason they don’t have fusion yet is 
they just can’t pump enough power 
through the system fast enough; but 
don’t get discouraged. The amount 
of power needed isn’t so very large 
after all. 

In fact, we calculated that a Sears 
Lifetime Battery contains about 4 
mega-joules; if we could just dis- 
charge it in a couple of nano-seconds 
we’d have fusion. 

They’re building a system that 
they expect will do the job. 

At the moment Sandia hopes to 
be at the squash court stage by 
1983: that is, by then they hope to 
have proved that electron bombard- 
ment, inertial confinement fusion 
will work and can, with a lot more 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



skull sweat and good engineering 
design, eventually be part of a use- 
ful electric power system. 

They’re doing that on five million 
dollars a year. This is the system I 
mentioned in the beginning of this 
article. I think it deserves more 
money, because with more money 
they may get to the squash court be- 
fore 1980. They don’t promise it, 
but then they don’t need much more 
money either; a doubling of their 
present five million annually would 
not only let them build more 
hardware faster, but also let them 
coordinate some theoretical work 
going on around the country , and 
bring in other scientists as consul- 
tants. 

So: if you’re in a mood to write 
your Congressman about energy 
problems, you might mention that 
here’s a slot where, in my consid- 
ered judgment, a few million bucks 
will do a lot of good. Please don’t 
support this because you think it 
will get us to the year 2000; it 
won’t. Don’t support it because you 
think it will eliminate our need for 
nasty Plutonium. Do it as a present 
for your children; do it because we 
could use some decent national 
goals, and cheap clean fusion power is 
one of the better gifts the US could 
offer the world (and wouldn’t it 
have far more beneficial and lasting 
effect than any billion-dollar foreign 
aid program you ever heard of?). 

Do it because we can afford it, 
and maybe it’s something we ought 
to do. ★

Part two 














Part II of III 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Can this be the solar system? The 
sun has become much hotter than 
three million years of stellar evolution 
can account for. There have been rad- 
ical changes in the topographies of 
Mercury and Mars and the atmosphere 
of Venus. Uranus is out of its orbit 
and missing some of its atmosphere. 
The only likely candidate for Earth 
now orbits Jupiter! And they’re both 
too hot! But if this isn’t the solar sys- 
tem, why is Saturn exactly where it 
ought to be? 

It’s driving PEERSSA crazy. Peerssa 
is a human personality recorded into a 
ship’s computer. His changed state has 
made Peerssa more intellectually rigid 
than ever. Always a patriot, Peerssa is 
determined to find or rebuild the State 
as it existed in 2190 AD. 

JEROME CORBELL’s motives are 
different. Corbell is a fragile old man. 
Bom 1921 AD, he lost most of three 
million years in the gravity well of a 
gigantic black hole at the galactic core; 
but he has only years or months to 
live. He chooses to land on Earth and 
explore while his life lasts. 

Failure to communicate: he lands in 
the wrong place. The new east coast of 
North America is far too hot for life. 
Try Antarctica? Corbell, his life limited 
by his pressure suit batteries, searches 
a dead city to find teleportation booths 
that don’t send far enough; then a 
subway network that might. 

It developes that the undersea sub- 
ways have been gimmicked by 
MIRELLY-LYRA ZEELASHISTHAR, 
an evil old woman with a remarkable 
cane and a remarkable mania. Corbell 
winds up as her prisoner, in country 

the children of the state 



cool enough to be habitable. 

Mirelly-Lyra was bom 50,000 years 
after Corbett’s proper time. She too 
has traveled to the galactic core. She 
returned much earlier; she knows 
something of the degeneration of the 
State. But her main concern is the Dic- 
tator immortality, which was some- 
where on Earth when she landed, and 
which may be still available, she be- 
lieves, over a million years later. Her 
small “zero-time jail” preserved her; 
why not the eternal youth treatment? 
But she has been unable to find it. 

Instead, she will settle for medicines 
more advanced than her own, brought 
back to Earth by a space-traveler who 
must have left the solar system 
thousands of years later than she did. 

Which is to say, Corbell. 

Corbell’ s protest brings a touch of 
the cane, which brings unbearable 
mental agony. The lesson is effective. 
CorbeU lies. Yes, he has the medicines, 
but they are aboard ship, in orbit. He 
himself is still ambulatory at around 
five hundred (he tells her). They can’t 
reach the ship unless Corbell calls 
Peerssa first, via the radio in his pres- 
sure suit helmet. 

Peerssa doesn’t answer. 

Corbell uses a teleporting “phone 
booth” to escape. But he’s half-sure 
Mirelly-Lyra can track him. 

He is moved by more than fear now. 
So the old woman would steal ad- 
vanced medicines from a later age, 
would she? Two could play at that 
game. 

STEALING YOUTH— 

He staggered through clean, 
geometric, empty, sound-deadened 
corridors. Doors did not drop for 
him. Twice he tried holding his 

53 




plastic disk against what he thought 
were entrance plates. It was all he 
could think of, and it didn’t work. 
Whatever this place was, 
Corbell — or the dead man he had 
robbed — was not authorized to pass 
these doors. 

The suit became too heavy for 
him. He dropped it. 

He talked to the helmet, but it 
didn’t answer. Where the hell was 
Peerssa? 

Corbell had freed Peerssa from 
all orders past and future. Corbell 
had gone unprotected into an un- 
known environment; had later 
dropped out of communication. J. 
B. Corbell, Mark II: missing, pre- 
sumed dead. By now Peerssa could 
be rounding the sun on his way to 
some nearby star. Searching for the 
State. 

Peerssa’s interstellar laser beam 
could have burned the old woman 
down as she crossed a street. But 
Corbell’ s computer had abandoned 
him . and Corbell hurled the 
helmet viciously into the cloud- 
rug — not as hard as he wanted, be- 
cause his hands were still bound. 
The blind faceplate stared after him 
as he went on. 

His legs were starting to cramp. 

The clean air was turning musty 
with the old smell of something 
truly dead, when Corbell came at 
last to an open door. He thought the 
mechanism had failed . and then 
he saw why. A small hole had been 
burned through the gold plate. 

Beyond the doorway was cruder 
damage and a richer smell. 

It had been a surgery, he guessed. 
At least, that looked like an 
operating table with machinery sus- 
pended above it, and the machinery 

54 



included scalpels on jointed arms. 

There were crumbled brown 
skeletons. One, naked, lay in a pool 
of dust on the table. Two others 
sprawled against a wall. Their uni- 
forms, partly decayed, were yet in 
better shape than the bones within. 
The cloth bore charred slashes that 
continued into the bones, as if men 
had been hacked by a white-hot 
sword. These men had been man- 
sized, Corbell’s size. 

The wall behind the desk had a 
hole in it big enough to drive a car 
through. Bombs? 

Corbell heaved himself up on the 
table with the skeleton. He rubbed 
the bandages against a scalpel 
edge . .and behold! His wrists 
were free. 

Now he moved to the great gap 
in the wall. He was getting his 
breath back, but his heartbeat was 
fast and Buttery . What he wanted 
most was a chance to lie down and 
rest . until he looked down into 
the vault. 

It was two stories high and win- 
dowless. To the left, a thick circle 
of metal almost the height of the 
wall, with a stylized ship’s wheel 
set in it. It looked for all the world 
like a bank-vault door. There were 
guard posts: glass cubicles set just 
below the ceiling, and in the cubi- 
cles were skeletons armed with 
things like spotlights with rifle 
butts. 

A bank vault seemed out of place 
in a hospital. 

There were shelves on all three 
walls, floor to ceiling. The few 
items still on the shelves were not 
gold bars. They were bottles. The 
floor, ten feet below Corbell, was 
covered with broken glass. 



GALAXY 




There was a half-melted metal 
thing very like the animated dish- 
washer that had attacked Corbell 
and Peerssa as burglars. Other 
machinery looked intact. There was 
an instrument console that might 
have been (given the hospital motif) 
diagnostic equipment. There were a 
matched pair of transparent “phone 
booths”, glass cylinders with 
rounded tops. Corbell saw these and 
lusted. 

The invaders had brought a lad- 
der. 

He climbed down carefully, treat- 
ing himself as fragile. Four skele- 
tons at the bottom showed that the 
invaders had not had things all their 
own way. He stepped carefully 
among the bones. As a hospital the 
place made a good crypt . better 
than most, in fact. Cool. Clean. No 
insects, no scavengers, no fungus. 

But it wasn’t death Corbell was 
running from. It was a silver cane 
and a change more humiliating than 
death. 

The lights were still on in the 
vault. Indicator lights glowed on the 
console. With luck the booths 
would work too. He stepped into 
one and looked for the dial. 

No dial, just a button set in a 
slender post. No choice about where 
he was going. Corbell wondered if 
the Norn would be waiting at the 
other end. He made himself push 
the button anyway. 

Nothing happened. 

He cursed luridly, pushed out of 
the booth and tried the other. The 
second booth didn’t even have a 
door, and there was fine dust float- 
ing in it. What the hell? 

What was this place? The drugs 
on the shelves must have been in- 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



credibly valuable. Four human 
guards and a metal killer, a single 
door that looked like it would stand 
off an atomic attack, an instant- 
elsewhere booth with only one ter- 
minal and another booth you 
couldn’t even get out of ... an in- 
vading army willing to go up 
against all that, with bombs 
. and suddenly he knew where 
he must be. 

It was a double jolt. 

Those shelves must have held 
Dictator immortality. And they were 
bare. 

Everything fitted. Of course 
you’d store geriatric drugs in a hos- 
pital. The booths must lead directly 
to Dictator strongholds . and 
even they could only appear in the 
closed booth. If the man in the 
booth wore the right face, someone 
outside could dial him into the 
booth that had a door. If not, he 
was a sitting duck for the laser 
weapons. 

And the vault door might well 
stand an atomic attack. But thieves 
had come through a wall . and 
maybe they’d used atomics too. Did 
Mirelly-Lyra know about this place? 
She must. She’d have kept looking 
until she found it. 

And so would Corbell, and she 
knew it: the Norn herself had told 
him about Dictator immortality. He 
had to get out of here. 

Exhaustion had become an ago- 
ny. He would climb the ladder if he 
must, if he could, but he tried the 
vault door first. And it was open! 
All of his strength and weight were 
just enough to swing it wide. The 
invaders must have left by the door 
they could not enter. 

So did he, very gratefully. The 

55 




line of “phone booths” was on this 
floor. He had walked a zigzag path 
from there; he might have trouble 
finding his way back — 

He saw the booths as he rounded 
a comer. And he saw Mirelly-Lyra 
Zeelashisthar, holding her cane like 
a gun and squinting at something in 
her other hand. Just before he 
ducked back he saw her look up at 
the ceiling with her teeth bared. 

It wasn’t him she was tracing. It 
was his pressure suit helmet. 

Peerssa, goodby. Corbell counted 
to thirty, then stuck his nose around 
the comer. She wasn’t there. He 
tiptoed through the cloud-rug to the 
next intersection and peered around 
it. She wasn’t there either, and he 
crossed the intersection at a leap 
and was in the nearest booth with 
the disc in his hand. 

Mirelly-Lyra would not have 
liked the way he was smiling. 

Two commas crossed; an S re- 
versed; an hourglass on its side and 
pushed inward from the ends; a 
crooked pi. The corridors vanished. 
In blackness he thumbed the door 
open and stepped out into black- 
ness. A gust of warm, damp wind 
whipped at him, and at the same 
time he saw dim light: a slender, 
hot pink crescent with the horns 
down at eye level. 

He stood still while his eyes ad- 
justed. A world took form around 
him. 

He was on a flat roof, looking 
into a solar eclipse. They must be 
fairly common these days, with 
both Sol and Jupiter occluding so 
much of the sky. But it was beauti- 
ful, a hot pink ring lighting sea and 
city with red dusk. He wished he 
could stay. 

56 



Mirelly-Lyra must be finding his 
pressure suit helmet about now. 

There were stairs. He would have 
been happier knowing how tall the 
building was, but he didn’t. He had 
to walk all the way to the 
bottom — and he was reassured to 
recognize the lobby — pause for a 
precious moment of rest, then climb 
up three flights. Next question: had 
the Norn noticed that he had not 
closed the office door? 

The sixth door was open a crack. 
He found a button blocking it. The 
door resisted his weight, gave 
slowly, let him in. 

They must have turned these of- 
fices out like popcorn boxes, he 
thought. Did this office connect to 
the exploded bedroom? He had bet 
his life on it. He stepped into the 
booth and looked for the intercom 
panel. 

Five buttons. He pushed the top 
one. 

Through the glass door he saw a 
sand beach and Tapping waves. 

Ye gods, those booths along the 
shore must have been private inter- 
com booths! The Dictators were 
selfish bastards, he thought; but his 
forebrain was occupied in pushing 
button #2. 

Back in the office. He pushed 

# 3 . 

In red-tinged darkness he saw a 
triangular floor plan, walls and roof 
exploded outward. A dark doughnut 
shape, coiled just where he would 
have stepped on it, raised a white 
face, questioningly. 

He shouted, “Yeediaa!” 

“Meep?” 

He jabbed the fourth button 
down. The startled cat-tail vanished. 

Sunken tub, shower ... He 

GALAXY 




thought of hot water and comfort 
and sleep, and the hell with it. 
Would the old woman set her pri- 
vate zero-time “jail” next to a Tur- 
kish bath? Why not? But he pushed 
the bottom button anyway, to see 
what there was to see. 

Thoughts of sleep returned. His 
knees sagged. His muscles and 
bones seemed to be melting. But he 
saw. Ovens and cupboards to left 
and right. A long dining table, 
floating, and lines of floating 
chairs. The hooded Nom at the far 
end, and the silver cane foreshort- 
ened, end on. Behind her, shards 
of a picture window, and a bundle 
of thick cables running over the sill. 

He stabbed two buttons and 
kicked out at the door. 

II 

He was trying to remember some- 
thing. It was urgent. 

—See now, I hit an intercom but- 
ton, then the door button, then kick 
out. Or the other way around? 
Intercom, door, kick out. Didn’t 
wait — couldn't wait — never thought 
so fast in my life. 

Pressure on his ankles. He 
thrashed a bit, got his elbows under 
him to lift his head. The door of the 
“phone booth” was trying to lift 
under his ankles. Beyond, the great 
red sun was almost whole again, a 
chunk still missing behind black Ju- 
piter. Closer: a desk floated above 
cloud-rug. 

He smiled and closed his eyes. 

It was seconds or minutes before 
he stirred himself. The sun was still 
cut by Jupiter. He stood on the door 
while he looked for something to 
wedge it. 

THE children of the state 



Assume the Nom was still guard- 
ing her zero-time device and her 
drug supply. He hadn’t seen it, but 
what else could the cables be for? It 
must be there, and now she knew 
he was after her drugs. By now she 
would have found that the intercom 
to the office wasn’t working. She 
would assume that Corbell had 
blocked the door open. If it started 
working now she’d be through in an 
instant. 

He couldn’t let the door close. 
But there wasn’t anything to wedge 
it. 

She could be coming here now. 

He’d barred her from the general 
“phone booth” system. Her car 
was here, just outside; she couldn’t 
use that. So . yeah. Her fastest 
route was by intercom to the beach. 
Jog down to someone else’s inter- 
com booth, thence to someone 
else’s office, dial for this building. 
By now she could be trotting down 
from the roof. And he still hadn’t 
found anything to block the door! 

He stripped off his undersuit and 
wedged it in the door. It was cool 
for a moment, until the sweat dried 
on him. Now he was naked 
. and ashamed; what he saw 
when he looked down was not a 
self to be proud of. But who would 
see him but Mirelly-Lyra? The old 
woman was probably in no better 
shape. 

His personal possessions had 
dwindled to an ancient, withered 
body (stolen) and a single plastic 
credit card disc (also stolen). He 
took them down three flights of 
stairs and out. 

The car was where they had left 
it. 

It wouldn’t start. He looked for a 

57 




key or a key slot. If the Nora had 
taken the key he’d have to walk. He 
found a slot, empty, and said a bad 
word before ne noticed its size . 

The plastic disc fit it perfectly. 

The cars must be public taxis. 
That was convenient. Now, if the 
cars’ destination codes resembled 
the booths’, all he had to do was 
punch for the police station. And 
get a gun! 

As he reached for the keyboard 
his hands started to shake. Then 
other muscles were twitching, and 
suddenly he was in convulsions. 
Strange noises came from his 
mouth. In fury and despair Corbell 
realised that the felon’s corpse had 
finally failed him; he was dying, 
and the timing was wrong, 
WRONG'. 

Please, no! Not till the battle’s 
over- 

lie locked his hands together and 
forced them at the keyboard. He 
punched the compressed hourglass, 
tried again and missed, again and 
hit, had to stop for a minute. Neck 
muscles locked and twisted his head 
backward, agonizingly, and he saw 
a car coming around the gently 
curved drive like a homing missile. 

The convulsions were getting 
worse. He stabbed at the hourglass 
key again, and again, and ... He 
didn’t know how often he’d hit it. 
When the car began to move he let 
the convulsions have their way. 

Mental agony. Unconsciousness. 
Now convulsions. Maybe he ought 
to be compiling a list of what the 
silver cane wouldn’t do. 

It wouldn’t stop a bubble car. 
The convulsions eased. Presently he 
could turn his head. Mirelly-Lyra 
was far behind him, out of her car, 

58 



still firing. His motion carried her 
around the curve of the drive. 

He tried to relax. Random mus- 
cles locked and released in his legs, 
his back, his neck, his eyelids. It 
wasn’t just the after-effects of the 
silver cane. He’d been through too 
much nightmare. He was too old for 
this kind of thing. He had always 
been too old to play Monster And 
Villagers through a maze of city- 
scape with an armed madwoman be- 
hind him. “Come on, calm down,” 
he whispered. “It’s all over. Un- 
less . ’’ Unless there was a 
“Follow that car’’ button in 
Mirelly-Lyra ’s dashboard. 

He’d still be there ahead of her. 
Allow, say, one minute to search 
the police station for a gun. Then 
get out. 

Oops! The booths didn't work. 
He’d tried to dial the police station 
earlier. 

The car tilted far over, rounded a 
comer and was on one of the radial 
streets. Corbell watched his rear. It 
was less unnerving than watching 
rubble come at him. 

He saw the edge of the hexagonal 
dome go past him. The street end- 
ed. He was crossing sand. Corbell 
turned in time to see a stretch of 
beach coming at him. 

The car ran straight toward the 
frothing white breakers, crossed 
them and headed out to sea at some- 
thing like ninety miles pier hour. 

Ill 

Corbell’s voice was a rusty, 
querulous whine. He didn’t like it. 
It was interfering with his search. 

It said, “All right, Corbell! You 
won the argument. If your 

GALAXY 




medicines were better you wouldn’t 
have tried to steal mine. Now let’s 
talk!” 

It wasn’t much of a search. He 
had hoped that Mirelly-Lyra might 
have stored food in her car. But 
he’d opened the glove compartment, 
and he’d looked under the seats, 
and what else was there? Slit the 
upholsteiy? 

Corbell was hungry. 

‘‘You’ll find the talking switch 
on the far right of the panel. Just 
push it upward. Corbell?” 

Sure. And then you'll track me 
down and — But Corbell was tempt- 
ed. He could ask her about food. 
He could ask her how to turn off 
the receiver. 

The car zipped over the waves 
toward whatever destination its idiot 
brain had read from Corbell’ s spas- 
tic directions. Beneath the edges of 
a thick grey-black cloud deck, the 
sun and crescent Jupiter had drifted 
apart along the horizon. The sun 
was lower now, its lower edge flat- 
tened. 

Something lifted out of the red 
sunglade. He thought it was a 
bottle-nosed dolphin until its size 
registered. It was halfway to the 
horizon, and lifting like a blimp re- 
leased! Its head tilted just a bit, and 
it looked him over while it slowly 
settled back into the frothing red 
sea. 

A dolphin the size of a whale. So 
we killed the whales off after all, he 
thought. And later there was an 
ecological niche . 

“1 must guess you’re hearing me, 
Corbell. I’m tracking you toward 
the southernmost continent, toward 
what used to be the boys’ capital 
c ity. You can’t lose me from your 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



path because you can’t leave your 
car. Talk to me.” 

It seemed she was tracking him 
anyway. He flipped the switch up 
and said, “Is there any food aboard 
this car?” 

“Hello, Corbell. If you try to 
steal my drugs again you will kill 
yourself. I’ve placed traps.” 

“Then I won’t.” 

“Then we will be searching in 
seperate places. I give you a year to 
find the Dictator immortality. I wish 
I could give more, but you know 
my condition. If you will find the 
drug, I will become your woman. 
Otherwise I will kill you.” 

He laughed. “A difficult 
choice.” 

“You have not seen me when I 
was beautiful. I am the only woman 
for you, Corbell. There are no 
others left.” 

“Don’t count on too much. 
Peerssa says I’m low on sex urge.” 
That upset her. “Have you never 
desired women, Corbell?” 

“I was married for twenty-two 
years.” 

“What is married?” 

“Mated. Under contract.” 

“Was there sex? Did you enjoy 
it?” 

Suddenly Corbell missed 
Mira belle terribly. He mourned her, 
not because she was dead, but be- 
cause she was gone. And her other 
half went on and on, through a 
world grown more and more hal- 
lucinatory. .If only he could 
have talked it over with Mira belle! 

“In sex and in all ways, our life 
was purest ecstasy, as is usual in 
marriage,” Corbell said with a flip- 
pancy he did not feel. “I’m sorry I 
brought it up.” 



59 




“I had to know.” 

Just to stick a pin in her, he said, 
“Has it ever occurred to you that I 
might not want the Dictator immor- 
tality? Maybe I’m content to grow 
old gracefully.” 

“You tried to steal my drugs.” 
“You’ve got me there.” 

“There is no grace to growing 
old. One year, Corbell.” 

“Hey, don’t hang up. Have you 
any idea where I’m headed? I don’t 
even know where we were.” 

“There is a continent that covers 
the South Pole. You are aimed 
there. As for where we were, there 
is a continent whose long tip points 
at the southernmost continent. We 
were nearly at the tip. I suspect 
your target to be the city of — ” and 
for a moment her own voice broke 
through, before his resumed. 
“Sarash-Zillish, the capital of 
Earth’s last civilization.” 

Departing Cape Horn for Antarc- 
tica, he thought. Where in Antarc- 
tica? 

“What destination did you 
type?” 

He risked telling her. “I was try- 
ing to get to the police station. 
What with the way my muscles 
were jumping around, I really don’t 
know what I hit.” 

“Could you have struck the key 
more than four times? Five would 
send you to World Police Headquar- 
ters in Sarash-Zillish.” 

“Maybe.” He laughed. “Well, it 
got me away from you.” 

“One year, Corbell.” 

In a year he could be 
dead . though in fact he felt pretty 
good. The aches, the exhaustion, 
die twitchies were going away. But 
the hunger had attained a fine cut- 

60 



ting edge. “In an hour I’ll be dead 
of starvation. Is there any food in 
this car?” 

“No.” 

“What do I eat?” 

“When you reach Sarash-Zillish, 
go to the park.” She gave him an 
address for the keyboard of his taxi. 
“The park is untended now, but 
any fruits you find are edible, and 
most of the animals can be eaten if 
you can catch them.” 

“Okay.” 

“You will not find Dictator im- 
mortality there. There were never 
adults in Sarash-Zillish.” 

“Hey, Mirelly-Lyra. How long 
have you been looking?” 

“Perhaps ten years of my life.” 
He was startled. “I got the im- 
pression you’d been at it for a cen- 
tury or so.” 

“I was unlucky. When the chil- 
dren revived me from zero-time, 
they told me they would search out 
the Dictator immortality for me. I 
had no choice but to believe them, 
but they lied.” 

“There was a vault in the 
hospital — ’ ’ 

She laughed. “There is a vault in 
every hospital in every city that re- 
mains on Earth. I have searched 
them all. What vaults haven’t been 
rifled contain nothing but poisons. 
The medicines have decayed with 
time and wet heat.” 

“Tell me more. What did you 
learn about this Dictator immortality 
after you landed, before they locked 
you up?” 

“Almost nothing. Only that it 
was there.” 

“Tell me. Tell me all the wrong 
answers so I don’t have to waste 
my time on them.” 



GALAXY 




IV 

The children had been waiting 
when Mirelly-Lyra descended from 
her spacecraft. Her first guess was 
that they must be the result of a 
State breeding program. Dignified, 
self-possessed, articulate, they dis- 
played an adult wisdom she took for 
supernormal intelligence. Later she 
realised that it was the result of 
lifetimes of experience. 

She had never seen their like. 

They had never seen hers. 

There were adults in the world, 
but they were a seperate breed. She 
never met them. She gathered that 
there were no more than a few 
thousand, all Dictator class by cour- 
tesy, all using the Dictator immor- 
tality. They kept themselves apart 
from the billions of children. 

The children tried her by her own 
law. She gained the impression that 
it was a farce for their amusement. 
Perhaps that was paranoia. They 
were punctilious; they did not mock 
her; they did not deviate from laws 
seventy thousand years old. For her 
part, Mirelly-Lyra kept her dignity 
at all times, as she was at pains to 
inform Corbell. 

They sentenced her to the zero- 
time jail. 

★ ★ ★ 

“Didn’t you hear anything about 
the interstellar colonies?’ ’ 

“No, nothing.” 

“It figures. They must have bro- 
ken away long before you landed. 
That’s why they fired on you. Not 
because you were Mirelly-Lyra, but 
because you were from Earth.” 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



There was a silence. Then, “I 
never understood that. Are you say- 
ing that the State broke apart?” 
“Yeah. It took a hell of a long 
time, that’s all. The State was a 
water monopoly empire.” Corbell 
was talking half to himself now. 
“They tend to last forever, unless 
something comes in from outside 
and breaks them up. But there 
wasn’t anything outside the State. 
The collapse had to wait till the 
State made its own barbarians.” 
Hesitantly Mirelly-Lyra said, 
“You talk as if you have known 
many kinds of State.” 

“I pre-date the State. I was a 
corpsicle, a frozen dead man. When 
the State was a century or so old, 
they . turned a condemned crim- 
inal into Jerome Corbell.” 

“Oh.” Pause. “Then maybe you 
know more than I do. How could 
the State Break apart?” 

“Look at it this way. First there 
was the State expanding through the 
solar system. Later, much later, 
there were a lot of copies of the 
State, one for each star, all belong- 
ing to one big State run from Earth. 
Then . well, I’m guessing. I 
think it was children’s immortality. 

“You made a big thing out of the 
advantages of making eleven-year- 
olds immortal. Okay, fine. What if 
the other States didn’t accept chil- 
dren’s immortality? Look at how 
different your children’s State would 
be! The other States probably 
claimed they were the original 
State. That makes the Solar System 
State heretical, its citizens unbeliev- 
ers.” 

“What would happen then? 
Would they stop talking to each 
other?’ ’ 



61 




Corbell laughed. “Sure. Right 
after the war. Right after both sides 
tried to exterminate each other and 
failed. That’s got to be the way it 
happened. It’s inevitable.” 

“Why?” 

“It just is.” 

“Then,” she said slowly, “that’s 
what happened to ... ” 

“What?” 

“When they took me out of 
zero-time there was more than one 
State on Earth. Maybe that was in- 
evitable too. Let me tell you.” 

* ★ ★ 

The children led Mirelly-Lyra to 
the peak of a squat silver pyramid. 
Widgets of silver and clear plastic 
floated around her: three dimen- 
sional television transmitters, and 
weapons that affected the mind and 
will. They turned off the pyramid; 
its mirror-colored sides became 
black iron. They put her in an 
elevator and sent her down. 

She joined a despondent rabble. 
Some tried to talk to her in gib- 
berish. She watched the elevator 
rise . and sink again with 
another prisoner. 

None spoke her language. 

The elevator never stopped rising 
and falling, bringing prisoners 
down, rising empty. The styles of 
those about her were wildly differ- 
ent; they continued to change with 
every' new prisoner. There was no 
provision for feeding the prisoners. 

It became obvious: nobody had 
been here long enough to become 
hungry. 

The twelfth to descend was not a 
prisoner. A girl of eleven dropped 
to just above their heads. Small 

62 



machines floated around her. One, a 
silver wand mounted in a larger 
base, twitched this way and that 
like a nervous hound eager to be 
loosed. The girl was naked, and 
strangely decorated: transparent 
dragonfly wings sprang from her 
shoulders. She called in a sweet, 
peremptory, oddly accented voice, 
“Mirelly-Lyra Zeelashisthar, are 
you here?” 

So Mirelly-Lyra returned to the 
world after perhaps a quarter of an 
hour of subjective time. 

* * ★ 

Her hosts were half a dozen chil- 
dren, all girls. The girl who had 
come for her, Choss, was in some 
ways the leader. Their social or- 
ganization was complex. 

Their minds were not the minds 
of children. They walked like the 
Lords of the World. They were ar- 
rogant and indulgent by turns, and 
Mirelly-Lyra learned to obey them. 
They trained her with the silver 
wand ... a variant of the silver 
cane she carried much later. 

It grated on her to think that they 
regarded her as a social inferior. 
Later she changed her mind. They 
regarded her as a house pet, a 
prized property that could do tricks. 

With the children she watched 
shows put on by other groups of 
children. Some they attended live. 
Others were broadcast as three- 
dimensional illusions, like holovi- 
sion sets arbitrarily large. Once they 
floated in interplanetary space for 
hours, and Mirelly-Lyra wondered 
at the grim intensity with which 
Choss’s girls watched a dull and re- 
pititious planetarium show. She un- 



GALAXY 




derstood later, during the voting. 

But most of the shows were bids 
for prestige. Some of the bulky 
floating widgets that followed her 
around were cameras and emotional 
sensors. Mirelly-Lyra was another 
show. Because of her, the prestige 
of Gloss’ s group was high. 

Her medicines had retarded, but 
not prevented, menopause. The 
change in her body was a near- 
killing blow to Mirelly-Lyra’ s faith 
in herself. She was a trained seal, 
and aging. One thing kept her go- 
ing. Somewhere out there was Dic- 
tator immortality. 

At first she welcomed the chance 
to talk to the girls. But that was the 
trouble: Mirelly-Lyra did all the 
talking. Her own questions were not 
answered. She was expected to an- 
swer the questions the girls put to 
her in full; if she didn’t lecture at 
length they became annoyed. 

Then, once, she found Choss in 
an indulgent mood. 

“Choss told me that the Dictators 
took care of their own medical 
problems,” said Mirelly-Lyra. 
“The Dictators were ruled by the 
boys, who made shows wiih them 
and who saw to it that chemicals in 
their food kept them from having 
children. I think Choss was jealous 
that the boys would not let girls 
play with the Dictators. I’m telling 
this badly,” she said suddenly. 
“These girls were all older than I. 
They were decadent aristocrats, not 
children.” 

“Yeah. I get the impression the 
girls and the boys stayed apart.” 

“Yeah, and it made things dif- 
ficult for me. Boys and girls, they 
didn’t have sex to hold them to- 
gether. They were two seperate 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



States on Earth, each with its terri- 
tory and its rights. They must have 
been seperate for a long time. 
Choss said that the girls ruled the 
sky and the boys ruled the Dic- 
tators. I would have to go to the 
boys to learn of Dictator immortal- 
ity.” 

“The girls ruled the sky ?” It 
sounded like nonsense, but . 

“Choss said so. I think it was 
true, Corbel 1. I saw them vote! But 
I was more concerned with the Dic- 
tator immortality. Choss promised 
to learn what I wanted from the 
boys. I was valuable to them, Cor- 
bell. They gained prestige from the 
stories I told and the shows they 
made about me.” Anger crackled in 
the translator’s voice as Mirelly- 
Lyra relived evil memories. “They 
were forever amused by what I did 
not know. Other groups of girls 
began reviving other prisoners. 
After many years I decided that 
Choss had done nothing to get me 
what I wanted. I would have to 
reach the boys.” 

“It figures.” 

“What?” 

“Choss couldn’t go to the boys. 
They’d claim you as a Dictator. 
Their property.” 

“I . never thought of that. I 
was a fool.” 

“Go on.” 

“The boys held the land masses 
of the southern hemisphere. They 
had built heated domes in the south 
polar continent. They held two 
other continents and many islands. 
But the girls ruled more useful land, 
and more power too, if they really 
ruled the sky. I knew that the Earth 
had been moved. There were times 
when Jupiter shone so brilliantly 

63 




that one could see the banding and 
pick out the moons. I was afraid of 
these girls. I was trying to find a 
safe way to steal an aircraft, but I 
waited too long. 

“One day Choss told me that 
they were tired of me, that I must 
go back in zero-time. I was no 
longer a new thing. I took a plane 
that night. They let me fly a long 
way before they brought me back 
on autopilot. I learned that they had 
made a show of my escape.” 

“Fun people, your girls. They 
put you back in the box?” 

“Yes. After a long time the 
machinery stopped. Everything was 
killing-hot. We prisoners couldn’t 
talk to each other. There was no 
cooperation. I saved myself — some 
of us lived — but it was a long time 
before I learned enough to feel my- 
self safe. I had to leam what could 
be eaten, what foods would not 
spoil, how to hide from storms 
... all things you will have to 
leam too. I was old when I could 
begin searching again. For ten years 
I searched. Then I built my small 
zero-time and went into it to wait 
for . you.” 

“Nice try.” 

“When you are young again, 
then mock me!” 

“I don’t expect that’ll happen.” 
“We can’t give up.” 

Corbell laughed. “/ can give up. 
I guess I damn well don’t believe in 
your Dictators’ immortality. Have 
you ever seen anyone get young?” 
“No, but—” 

“Do you even know what makes 
people get old? Fires don’t burn 
backward, lady.” 

“I am not a doctor. I only know 
what anyone knows. Inert molecules 

64 



accumulate in the cells, 
like . like silt and metabolic 
poisons accumulating in a great in- 
land sea, until the sea becomes a 
great inland swamp. The cells be- 
come less . active. Some die. 
One day there are too few active 
cells living too slowly. Other inert 
matter accumulates to block the 
veins and arteries . but I have 
medicines to dissolve them.” 

“Cholesterol, sure. But getting 
the dead stuff out of a living cell 
without killing it would be some- 
thing else again. I think you were 
hoaxed,” said Corbell. “Choss and 
her friends acted like nasty children. 
Why not your boy lawyer too? Re- 
member, you asked the girls. They 
didn’t raise the subject.” 

“But whyV' 

“Oh, just to see what you’d — ” 
‘Wo!” 

“Everyone dies. Your lawyer’s 
dead. Choss is dead. Even civiliza- 
tions die. There was a civilization 
here that could move the Earth. 
Now there’s nothing.” 

After a longish silence came the 
calm voice of the translating box. 
“There are boys where you’re go- 
ing. I tried to talk to them once. 
They know nothing of Dictator im- 
mortality.” 

“Do they know what happened to 
civilization?” 

“You said it yourself. There 
were two States on Earth. They 
must have fought.” 

“It could have happened.” War 
between the sexes had always 
seemed silly to Corbell. Too much 
fraternizing with the enemy, ha ha. 
But if sex didn’t hold them to- 
gether? 

“The boys know nothing,” She 
GALAXY 




repeated. “Perhaps there was never 
Dictator immortality in the south 
polar continent.” 

“You’ve got a one track mind. If 
it ever existed, you found it in 
every city in the world. Used up. 
Rotted.” 

“One year, Corbell.” 

Might as well try it . “How 
does this sound? Let me use your 
medicines. 1 can travel faster and 
look further if I’m young and 
healthy.” 

Another long pause. Then, “Yes, 
that makes sense.” 

“I thought you’d say no.” Here 
was his chance! But . “Nuts. 
No, I just can’t risk it. You scare 
me too much. This way at least I 
get a year.” 

She screamed something that was 
not translated. The receiver went 
dead. 

A year, he thought. In a year I'll 
be dug in so deep she’ll never find 
me at all. 

THE CHANGELINGS 
I 

Corbell came to the Antarctic 
shore in near darkness. The van- 
ished sun had left dark red splashed 
across the northern horizon, and a 
red-on-red circle that was Jupiter’s 
night side. To east and west he 
picked out tiny Jovian moons. 
Ahead, dark woods came down to a 
dark shore. 

The trees came at him, spreading 
out. 

Then the smooth ride was bounc- 
ing Brownian motion, and the car 
was dodging tree trunks at maniac 
speed. He gripped the padded bar to 
keep himself from bouncing around 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



inside. He dared not close his eyes. 
The chase scenes through Four City 
should have burned away his capac- 
ity for terror, but they hadn’t, they 
hadn’t. 

The old trees forced their way 
through a tangle of burgeoning life, 
vines, underbrush, big mushrooms, 
everything living on each other. A 
pair of huge birds ran screaming 
from the car. The car rode high, but 
branches slashed at its underside. 

The forest thinned . and 
showed masonry half-hidden in 
vines. The car was already racing 
through Sarash-Zillish. Soil and 
grass and small bushes had invaded 
the streets. If this was Three Ci- 
ty ... if this was the Antarctic 
source of industrial activity Peerssa 
had sensed from orbit , . then it 
was far gone. 

The car was slowing. Thank 
God. It scraped slowly over crack- 
ling brush, stopped in the open, and 
sank. Corbell got out onto moist 
grass. He stretched. He looked 
about him. 

In the darkness it was barely pos- 
sible to pick out two distant curved 
walls of hexagonal filigree where a 
dome must have stood. Corbell 
found no sign of the great black 
cube, the subway station, that had 
been the center of every city he’d 
seen so far. 

He was parked beside what must 
be World Police Headquarters: a 
great wall of balconies and dark 
windows, with a row of large circu- 
lar holes at the top, holes big 
enough to be access ports for flying 
police cars. 

There might be weapons in 
there . 

But there was certainly food in 

65 




the park, and Corbell was faint with 
hunger. With some reluctance he 
climbed back into the car and typed 
inverted L, inverted L, nameless 
squiggle, delta. 

* * * 

Like the woods beyond the city, 
the park was spreading into the 
streets. The car stopped over a 
patch of tangled vines. He stepped 
out into it, having precious little 
choice, and found himself thigh- 
deep in tough vines that pulled him 
back like a nest of snakes. He 
waded out. 

Hunger had never done anything 
for Corbell’s disposition. It made 
him irritable, unfit to live with. 

A wall of greenery twice his 
height ended just ahead of him. On 
theory that there was a real wall 
under that tangle of vines, Corbell 
walked to the end, turned, and en- 
tered the park proper. 

There was no obvious difference. 
It was as dark as the inside of a 
mouth. Jupiter’s horizontal light 
couldn’t reach through trees and 
buildings. Corbell wished for a 
flashlight, or a torch; but he didn’t 
even have a match, corbell Mark 
II, bare-ass naked against the wil- 
derness, would not be hunting prey 
tonight. 

But fruit, now . these could 
be fruit trees. The Nom had said 
they were. Corbell stood beneath a 
tree and ran his hands through the 
branches. Something round bounced 
against his wrist. 

It was pear-shaped, bigger than a 
pear, with thick, rough skin. He 
stripped some of the rind away with 
his teeth, bit into . creamy av- 

66 



ocado flesh, milder in taste than av- 
ocado. 

He ate it all. He threw away the 
skin and pit and felt through the 
branches for another. 

A furry tentacle dropped famil- 
iarly around his neck. 

Corbell grabbed. Sharp teeth 
closed between his neck and shoul- 
der. The pain sickened him. His 
closing right hand slipped along fur, 
was stopped by a thickening ... a 
head. He wrenched at it. The teeth 
came loose, and tentacle came loose 
and immediately wrapped new loops 
around his forearm. By starlight he 
saw a small snarling face. He was 
strangling a cat-tail. 

The little beast could as easily 
have tom his eyes or his jugular. It 
was trying to bite him now. Even 
so, he didn’t especially want to 
kill it . 

He banged its head against a 
branch. Its grip loosened. A 
pitcher’s fast-ball gesture flung it 
away. It coiled on the ground, lifted 
a head to study him. He was too 
big. It went away. 

The wound was muscle tissue, 
and wasn’t bleeding badly, but still, 
it hurt. Corbell sent a curse to fol- 
low the cat- tail. He found and ate 
two more avocados. Good enough. 
He went back to the car, locked 
himself in and went to sleep. 



the first day 

Corbell made his breakfast on 
tiny apples and apple-sized grape- 
fruit. The cat-tails had disappeared. 
He sat quietly while he ate, and was 
rewarded. Squirrels (maybe; they 
moved fast) popped into view and 
vanished. A bird ran out of the 

GALAXY 




woods, stopped short in front of 
him — it was as tall as his shoulder, 
dressed in the autumn colors of a 
turkey — squawked jn terror and 
fled. 

Presently he picked up a thick 
branch, knobbed at the end. A 
machete was what he really had in 
mind, but the club had a nice heft. 
He went exploring. 

The park was a jungle of de- 
lights. He found fruit trees and nut 
trees and trees that grew fist-sized 
warty things whose taste he would 
have to try, later. Pineapples and 
coconut palms fought for room. 
String beans grew on vines that 
were strangling some of the trees. 
On a hunch Corbell pulled up some 
smaller plants and found fat roots: 
potatoes or carrots or yams, maybe. 
He was seeing them by reddened 
light; for a million years they had 
been adapting to that reddened light 
and the twelve-year Antarctic day; 
of course they were unrecognizable. 
But they might be edible, if he 
could cook them, if he could start a 
fire. Or find one. 

* * * 

The ground floor of World Police 
Headquarters was clean and empty. 
Corbell found no dead bodies, no 
guns left lying about, no uniforms. 
Even the desks were gone. He was 
disappointed. He had hoped at least 
to clothe himself. 

He tried an elevator. It worked. 

Over several hours of exploring 
he found that the twenty-story build- 
ing was bare to the walls, from the 
empty hangars under the rooftop 
landing pad, to the wonderfully 
filigreed cells in the fifth through 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



seventh floors, to the offices on the 
second. Nothing remained that 
wasn’t part of the structure itself. 

But the elevators worked. He 
kept looking. 

Where desks had been he found 
slots for trash. He tracked them to 
their outlet: a metal trash can, 
empty. He carried it out to the car. 
It was the closest thing he’d found 
to a cooking pot. Now if he could 
find water . and fire . 

He’d already been through the 
big room on the tenth floor. There 
was an acre of flat surface in here: 
tabletop along all four sides, a big 
square table in the middle with bins 
under it, doors with shelves behind 
them. Now, searching more care- 
fully, he opened long panels and 
found knobs under them. He turned 
all the knobs as far as they could 
go, hoping to find a heat-source: 
this could be a kitchen. 

He went down to the car. He 
came back with a generous armful 
of dried grass, and the club. 

Most of the kitchen mechanisms 
must have stopped working. A snug 
and solid door proclaimed a cup- 
board to be a refrigerator. Some of 
the flat surface had to be griddles; 
but they weren’t hot. A small glass 
door with a shelved recess behind it 
was hot. An oven. Corbell stuffed 
the grass into it, and waited 
. and waited . while the 
grass smoldered . smoldered 
more . and, suddenly, burned. 
He opened the door and set the club 
in the burning grass. When the 
grass burned out the knob on the 
end was barely smoldering. By then 
Corbell had found an exhaust fan. 
He let that blow on the coals until 
he had a small flame. 



67 




★ * ★ 

The rain started as he reached the 
car. 

The car refused to move unless 
the doors were closed . with the 
club inside with Corbell, smolder- 
ing. The small flame had gone out. 
The rain fell tremendously, as if it 
would never stop until the world 
was all water. Smoke inside and 
rain outside; Corbell couldn’t see at 
all. 

Fortunately the ride was short. 
The car settled over the exact same 
patch of tangle vines. Corbell 
pushed the trash can out into the 
rain, but he stayed in the car, blow- 
ing on the coals, with the doors 
open. 

The afternoon rain went on and 
on. When the club stopped smolder- 
ing Corbell didn’t care. All the 
wood in the park would be soaked 
by now. He waded out into the wet 
and got his dinner of assorted fruits 
before the light was quite gone. 

Again he slept in the car. A 
cramped, damp, wakeful night fol- 
lowed a miserable day. In this 
jungle of delights, this wilderness in 
which everything that grew seemed 
intended to serve man, Corbell had 
failed to make fire even with the 
help of a kitchen oven. Robinson 
Crusoe would have sneered. 

But the cat-tail bite was healing. 
No fever: he had escaped rabies and 
tetanus. 

Tomorrow. Try again tomorrow. 



the second day 

— was bigger, better, faster. He 
took the car to World Police Head- 
quarters. He carried two armfuls of 

68 



damp scavenged wood into an 
elevator and up to the kitchen. He 
put them in the oven. He’d forgot- 
ten to turn it off yesterday; it saved 
him time now. He turned on the 
exhaust and left. 

A little searching found him a 
second trash can. He took it up. 
The logs were smoldering, burning 
in places, but still wet. He left them 
to it. The kitchen was full of 
smoke, despite the exhaust fan. 

Impatience got to him. There 
were not even flames on the black- 
ened logs now. He opened the 
oven door, letting in air. The gasses 
caught with a soft whoosh. Corbell 
leapt back slapping at his hair and 
eyebrows; but no, they hadn’t 
caught. 

He had to tear a door off a nar- 
row cupboard. It was the only tool 
he could find. With the door he har- 
ried the logs out of the oven and 
into the trash can. He took the cup- 
board door along too. Flat metal, it 
might serve somehow. 

His way back to the park was 
slower. Three times he had to open 
a door to let out the smoke; each 
time the car slowed as if it had 
rammed invisible taffy. But he got 
back, and maneuvered the trash can 
out of the car into the patch of 
vines, under a threatening sky. The 
logs had gone to coals. 

He turned the can on its side and 
braced the bottom higher than the 
lip. He pushed the coals into a pile 
at the back. He found more wood, 
not too damp, which he set in the 
trash can to be dried by the heat. 
When the warm rain opened up on 
him it didn’t bother him. It was not 
especially uncomfortable, and now 
his fire was safe. 



GALAXY 




This time a million years 
ago . this time two million years 
ago . Corbell the spaceman had 
already crossed tens of thousands of 
light years, and at the core of the 
galaxy was skirting the edge of a 
black hole massive as a hundred 
million suns . 

Corbell the naked savage went 
forth to hunt his dinner. 

Living things rustled around him, 
but he saw nothing. It didn’t matter. 
He didn’t have anything to kill 
with, not so much as a kitchen 
knife. He kept his eyes open for 
another club while he pulled up 
roots. He pulled up quite a number 
of different roots. He’d roast them 
all, and taste them. 

He spent more time gathering 
nuts. The rain stopped. This rain 
seemed regular enough: starting just 
after noon, lasting two or three 
hours. It was nice to be able to 
count on something. In the custom- 
ary red sunset light he sat down to 
cook his dinner. 

He had to throw away half the 
roots. He got, in rough and approx- 
imate terms, one potato, one very 
large beet, a combination yam and 
carrot, and a more nearly pure yam. 
He burned most of the nuts, but 
some survived; and were delicious. 
He went back for more. 

Then night was upon him. He set 
the trash can upright and set some 
fallen tree limbs upright on the 
coals, and settled down to sleep in 
a patch of nearly dry moss. 

the third day 

Corbell half-woke in darkness. 
He felt fur and a warm spot against 
his back, but elsewhere he was chill- 
ed. He curled more tightly around 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



himself and went back to sleep. 

Some time later the memory 
snapped him awake. Fur? There 
was nothing against his back now. 
A dream? Or had a friendly cat-tail 
stretched against him for warmth? 
The touch hadn’t wakened him fully. 
He and Mirabelle used to share 
their king-sized bed with a kitten, 
until the kitten became a tomcat and 
started behaving like one. 

Well, he was awake now. He did 
easy exercises until the stiffness was 
gone. He breakfasted on fruit; what 
else? Perhaps he ought to be look- 
ing for nests, and eggs. 

The fire was still going. He built 
it up with twigs, then went looking 
for larger pieces. He wished for an 
ax. The little stuff burned too fast, 
the big stuff was too heavy to 
move, and he would soon use up all 
the dead limbs in the area. He spent 
part of the morning dragging a huge 
limb to his replenished fire. After 
he had tilted the trash can on its 
side and pushed the big end of the 
limb into it, he decided he’d created 
a fire hazard. He moved the whole 
arrangement onto a nearly buried 
outcropping of granite. 

It was meat he hungered for. If 
he could find a straight sapling 
perhaps he could fire-harden it into 
a spear ... if he could sharpen a 
point. What he really needed was a 
knife, he thought. For that alone it 
was worth exploring Sarash-Zillish. 

* * * 

Four crossed-commas brought the 
car to the Sarash-Zillish Hospital. 
Corbell recognised it at once. From 
outside it was identical to the Four 
City Hospital. 



69 




Civilization must have become 
awfully stereotyped before its col- 
lapse. Corbell fantasized a great 
pogrom in which all the world’s ar- 
chitects had died. Afterward hu- 
manity had been reduced to copying 
older buildings detail for de- 
tail ... It didn’t make a lot of 
sense. He’d look for other reasons 
for the duplication he saw ev- 
erywhere. 

Inside, the place kept reminding 
him of his nightmare flight from 
Mirelly-Lyra. Clean corridors, doors 
with no handles, cloud-rug . The 
only difference was the lack of a 
vault. He found a central place, a 
two-story room lined with shelves 
and occupied by a computer that 
must be diagnostic equipment. But 
there was no vault door and no 
double “phone booth”. No precau- 
tions against thieves. No mum- 
mified losers. 

If Mirelly-Lyra had not lied, the 
“boys” had owned this city. They 
would not have needed to steal Dic- 
tator immortality. Only Dictators — 
adults — would need that. 

He found more locked doors 
. that would open with a kick. 
He found an operating room: two 
flat tables with straps attached, and 
clusters of jointed arms above them, 
tipped with scalpels and suction 
tubes and needles and clamps. The 
metal showed the stains of neglect 
and age. 

That stiffly extended insectile 
arm: that was his target. Corbell 
climbed up on a table, leaned out to 
grip the arm at its end. He swung 
outward and hung suspended. The 
arm sagged, then broke in the mid- 
dle and dropped him to the floor. 

Corbell the hunter left the hospi- 



tal carrying three feet of metal spear 
with a scalpel at the end. 

★ * * 

Again the rains caught him on the 
way back. He made his way to his 
fireplace, checked to see that the 
fire was still going, then sat down 
to wait it out. There were several 
inches of water in his other trash 
barrel. 

He was killing time by trying to 
shave — very carefully, but the 
weight of the handle was awkward 
and he wasn’t doing a good job of 
it — when he saw the giant turkey. It 
was pecking under a nut tree, look- 
ing bedraggled and unhappy. He 
froze. It hadn’t seen him. He de- 
bated as to whether he might sneak 
up on it. Probably not. 

He eased forward onto the balls 
of his feet, spear held lightly in 
both hands. 

He sprinted. The bird looked up, 
squawked, turned and fled. Corbell 
swung the spear and chopped at its 
foot. The bird stopped to peck at 
whatever had bitten it. Corbell 
chopped again, at the neck, and felt 
the satisfying shock in his shoul- 
ders. 

The bird was hurt and in panic. It 
ran in clumsy circles, squawking, 
while Corbell chased it. He got two 
more shots at the neck, and then he 
had to stop, gasping, his pulse 
thundering in his ears. The bird was 
spouting blood. It hadn’t slowed 
down, but its flight was Brownian 
motion, sheer blind panic. 

It had not gone far when Corbell 
recovered his breath and resumed 
the chase. He was moving in for the 
kill when the bird turned and ran 



70 



GALAXY 




straight at him. A lucky swing as he 
sprawled backward, and the bird 
was headless. It ran right over him 
and kept going. 

He tracked it until it fell over. 

The patch of bare rock was 
nearly dry. Corbell spilled his fire 
across it, added more wood, then 
went back for the bird. He pulled 
feathers until he was exhausted, 
rested, pulled more feathers. He 
opened the bird’s belly and cleaned 
it, tugging two-handed at internal 
organs, his feet braced on rough 
rock. 

The cupboard door from the 
police station became his griddle. 
He fried the liver on it, and ate it 
while parts of the rest of the bird 
were roasting. Afterward he worked 
at cutting into the joints. He 
couldn’t build his fire big enough to 
roast the whole bird, but he could 
roast a drumstick. And broil thick 
slices of breast on a stick. 

Meat! It was good to taste meat 
again. There was far too much to 
use tonight. He had roasted both 
drumsticks; he could eat them cold 
tomorrow. He could cut up parts of 
the carcass and boil them for soup, 
in the other trash can, with some of 
the roots. 

But for tonight he’d had enough. 

II 

The northeast was turning gray, 
but in the black northwestern sky 
one star still glowed. Corbell had 
watched it on several nights. It did 
not twinkle and it did not move 
against the stellar background. That 
made it a planet, a big object dimly 
lit, possibly the world whose 
skewed orbit had disturbed Peerssa. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



Now it twinkled; now it was mar- 
ginally brighter. Corbell blinked. 
Just his imagination? Now it was 
fading before the coming 
dawn . Corbell closed his eyes. 
He didn’t want to wake up. There 
was no special reason why he 
should. He wasn’t hungry or un- 
comfortable. 

He’d learned much about the 
empty city during these past twenty 
days, but there were mysteries still 
to be explored. His encampment 
had become comfortable. He had a 
fireplace, a soup pot, and the car 
for shelter. He had tools: he had 
used the scalpel to carve wooden 
cooking implements. He didn’t need 
clothes. For two full days he had 
practiced throwing rocks, and taken 
his reward in squirrel meat. Yester- 
day he had killed another giant tur- 
key, his third. 

Big deal. 

Obscurely depressed, he curled 
tighter in his bed of moss. 

Corbell the architect and Corbell 
the interstellar explorer seemed 
equally dead. In his pride he had 
called himself a naked savage, but 
he wasn’t that. A savage has his 
duties to the tribe, his tribe’s duties 
to him. He has legends, songs, 
dances, rules of conduct, permitted 
and unpermitted women, a place for 
him when he grows old . but 
Corbell was an outcast. He could 
make fire — with the help of a 
supersophisticated kitchen. He could 
feed himself — now that practically 
everything he could touch was edi- 
ble. 

Some park. In the beginning it 
must have held only food plants and 
meat animals. City surrounding a 
farm. The cat-tails could hardly 

71 




have survived, vain and decorative 
though they were, in the presence 
of real predators. 

Domed cities. Mirelly-Lyra had 
spoken of the Boys having built 
domed cities, here in land the more 
powerful Girls hadn’t held. But of 
course: Sarash-Zillish must have 
been domed against blizzards and 
subzero cold, before the world 
turned unaccountably hot. As for 
the “park”, the Boys could hardly 
have grown beans and citrus fruit in 
the permafrost outside. 

The Girls ruled the 
sky .... controlled Earth’s orbit. 
They must have made a mistake 
somewhere. What could have turned 
Jupiter into a minor sun? It must 
have shocked the Girls as badly as 
it later shocked Peerssa. It must 
have; because the change left Boy 
territory habitable and made Girl 
territory into scalding deserts, over- 
turning a balance of power tens or 
hundreds of thousands of years old. 

Corbell shifted, then sat up. It 
was the present that ought to con- 
cern him . 

. Three cat-tails were tearing 
at his turkey carcass. When he 
moved they jolted to attention. Cor- 
bell reconsidered his first intention. 
They were eating the raw meat; 
they had left the roasted drumsticks 
alone. There was plenty of meat left 
for Corbell. 

They studied him: three snakes 
with solemn cat faces, furred in 
brown and orange intricately pat- 
terned; as beautiful as three but- 
terscotch sundaes. Corbell smiled 
and gestured hospitably. As if they 
understood, they went back to their 
meal. 

Breakfast: he ate fruit and 
72 



drumstick meat and thought about 
coffee. Afterward he tended his 
fire. The scalpel was razor-sharp 
despite age and eighteen days of 
use, but it was no ax. He went far 
afield to find wood. The exercise 
was good. Decades in the cold sleep 
coffin had preserved him better than 
he had hoped; he’d gone soft de- 
spite the exercises, but the savage 
life was toning him up. He took the 
other trash can to what had been a 
fountain and was now a pond, filled 
it with not especially clean water, 
dragged it back and wrestled it into 
place on the fire. 

He turned to the turkey carcass. 
He cut chunks small enough to fit 
the trash can. Meat gnawed by cat- 
tails went in, and so did bare bones. 
While it heated he foraged for roots 
to flavor the soup. Potatoes. 
Carrot-yams. He’d found nothing 
that resembled an onion, unfortu- 
nately. He added beans and, ex- 
perimentally, a couple of grapefruit. 
He stirred it all with a wooden pad- 
dle. 

As usual, noon looked like sun- 
set, endlessly disconcerting. Corbell 
rested. The water was beginning to 
bubble. Granite was uncomfortable 
beneath his buttocks. Corbell was 
mildly depressed, and he couldn’t 
understand why . 

And then he did. 

Last day of a camping trip. 
You've worked your tail off; your 
belt has come in a notch and a half; 
you haven’t had to think much; 
you’ve seen some magnificent scen- 
ery; there were damn few people on 
the trails, and they didn’t rub your 
nerves. It’s been good. But now it's 
back to work — 

Mirelly-Lyra knew where he was. 

GALAXY 




He was healthier than he’d 
known. He could live a Jovian year, 
if nothing killed him; the tourist in 
him liked that thought. The mad old 
woman had promised him one year, 
an Olde Earth year. He could be- 
lieve as much of that as he cared to, 
but a sane man would choose the 
jungle. 

Could a man survive in the jungle 
outside Sarash-Zillish? It would de- 
pend. Corbell had come to Antarc- 
tica in either spring or fall of a year 
twelve years long. An Olde Earth 
year from now the day might last 
twenty-three hours, or one. It would 
be much warmer than this, or much 
colder. 

For the world still had its tilt and 
its twenty-four-hour rotation. Odd 
that the Girls had not corrected 
that . but maybe they were 
traditionalists. Much odder that they 
had not moved Earth out from the 
growing heat of Jupiter. What con- 
cerned Corbell was this: he could 
not take a world twenty degrees 
colder, not without clothing, and 
endless night might drive him mad. 

Soup odors were beginning to 
permeate the wood smoke. 

This sense of urgency was silly. 
He had a year to get moving. He 
could make foraging expeditions to 
the edge of the city. Keep his camp 
here. Whatever was out beyond the 
domes had had to be imported. 
How dangerous could it be? It 
might well be thousands of square 
miles of Sarash-Zillish Park. 

An endless vacation. And he 
could use it. In his second life 
corbell Mark II had suffered 
enough future shock to kill a whole 
cityful of Tofflers. 

Tomorrow, then. He could take 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



the car as far as the hospital; it was 
near a standing fragment of dome. 
Then into the wild with spear and 
drumstick over either shoulder, if 
the drumstick kept that long without 
refrigeration. 

He remembered to scrape some 
of his fire into his trash can fire- 
place. He stretched out on the warm 
granite . 

* + * 

Warm rain hammered at him. He 
turned over fast, rose to hands and 
knees and coughed out a table- 
spoonful of rainwater. First time that 
had happened. His bonfire must be 
out, but had the soup cooked first? 
Was rain getting into his fireplace? 

He looked up, and forgot all of 
these crucial questions. 

A dozen or so boys — 
approximately a big boy scout 
troop, but uniformed only in 
breechclouts — squatted in a circle 
around Corbell and his fire. They 
were passing around a drumstick 
bone, nearly clean by now, while 
they watched him. As if they had 
been watching him in perfect si- 
lence for hours. 

Their hair was rich where they 
had hair. On some it was black and 
wooly, on others black and straight, 
dripping to their shoulders. The 
crowns of their heads were bald but 
for a single tuft on each forehead. 
They ignored the pounding rain and 
watched, half-smiling. 

“I should have known,” said 
Corbell. ‘‘The cat-tails. They’re 
half tame. All right.” He made a 
sweeping gesture. “Welcome to the 
Kingdom of Corbell-for-himself. 
Have some soup.” 



73 




They frowned, all of them. One 
got up: a long, lanky boy, a bud- 
ding basketball player, Corbell 
would have judged. He spoke. 

“Sorry,” said Corbell. 

The boy spoke again. Command 
and anger: that was no boy’s voice, 
though it was high-pitched. Corbell 
was hardly surprised. These were 
the Boys, Mirelly-Lyra’s immortals. 

“I don’t speak your language,” 
Corbell said slowly, with an instinct 
that went against sense: the natives 
will understand if you speak slowly 
and clearly. 

The boy came forward and slap- 
ped him across the face. 

Corbell hit him flush in the 
mouth. His right cross hit ribs in- 
stead of solar plexus, and the fol- 
lowing left missed completely, 
somehow. Then the whole circle 
converged on him. 

His memory thereafter was a little 
hazy. There was weight on his 
knees and forearms. Granite ground 
into his back. The basketball star 
sat on his chest and spoke the same 
sentence over and over through a 
split lip. He would say it, and wait, 
and slap Corbell twice, and say it 
again. Corbell replied with 
obscenities. He could feel the 
bruises now; they hurt sufficiently. 

The tall boy got off his chest. He 
said something to the others. They 
all frowned down at Corbell. They 
discussed the matter in complex 
consonants spat like mouthfuls of 
watermelon seeds. 

Corbell’s head still rang; it had 
been beaten against granite. Four 
boys were still sitting on his 
forearms and knees. Rain splashed 
in his eyes. It all tended to muddle 
his thinking. 

74 



Did they think he was a strayed 
Dictator? But Corbell was showing 
his age. They couldn’t — Wrong. No 
Dictator immortality here. The Dic- 
tators must grow old as Corbell had 
grown old. 

The discussion ended. Four boys 
got off Corbell. He sat up rubbing 
his arms. One took a theatrical 
pose, pointed at the ground before 
him, and spat one harsh word. Stay! 
or Heel! His message was plain, 
and Corbell was in no shape to run. 

The tall boy still studied Corbell 
as if trying to make up his mind. 
The others clustered around Cor- 
bell’s soup pot. They scooped soup 
into halves of coconut shells. The 
tall boy finally offered him some- 
thing else, a ceramic cup from his 
belt. Corbell waited for room, then 
moved in. 

He sat (gingerly, favoring the 
bruises) and drank. Cat-tails moved 
among the tribe like a plague of 
snakes; rubbed against ankles, and 
were petted; tore at the raw turkey 
carcass, what was left of it. Corbell 
felt fur against his ankle. He 
stroked a pure black cat-tail. A 
rumbling vibration went through his 
shin. 

Shall we say that Corbell has 
been captured again? Or, Corbell 
asked himself, shall we say that 
Fate has given me guides through 
Antarctica? Put that way, the deci- 
sion was easy . 

Ill 

The soloist sang in a strong, rich 
tenor. He sang to background mu- 
sic: eight Boys humming in at least 
four parts, one more beating with 
turkey bones on Corbell’ s trash can 

GALAXY 




fireplace. Alien music, improvised, 
overly complex against the simple 
melancholy tune. 

Corbell listened open-mouthed, 
the back of his neck tingling. He 
had feared this, and it was true: 
three million years had increased 
human intelligence. 

“Oh, we got a new computer, 
but it's quite a disappointment,’’ 
Ktollisp sang, “ ‘cause it always 
gives this same inyane advice: Oh, 
you need little teeny eyes for read- 
ing little teeny print like you need 
little teeny hands for milking mice!’ ’ 
The flavor of mockery in his sing- 
ing was for Corbell. He couldn’t 
know what the words meant. But 
his pronunciation was accurate. 

Corbell had sung that song once . 

He had taken to singing in an ef- 
fort to enhance his entertainment 
value. He sang medleys of advertis- 
ing jingles, or the clean and dirty 
folk songs he and Mirabelle had 
sung on the boat. The Boys liked it. 
They didn’t like it when he repeated 
a song they’d heard before. He had 
wondered why. 

Beside him was the boy who had 
attacked him that night a week ago, 
the leader in some respects. 
Skatholtz was broad of nose and 
lip, wooly-haired, long-limbed and 
emaciated-looking. He might have 
been a black pre-teen, but for the 
partial baldness and the prison pal- 
lor he shared with the others. He 
said in English, “He sings well, do 
you think?” and laughed at what he 
found in Corbell’s face. “Now you 
know.” 

“You remember everything. Ev- 
erything! Even whole songs in 
another language ! ’ ’ 

“Yes. You need to learn my 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



speaking more than I need to learn 
your speaking, but I learn yours 
first. This is why. You are differ- 
ent, Corbell. Older. I think you are 
older than anything.” 

“Almost anything.” 

“I will teach you how to talk. 
When you tell your tale, we all 
want to listen. I make a mistake 
with you. Do you know why I hit 
you? We thought you are only a 
dikt who broke with rules. You did 
not — ” Skatholtz jumped suddenly 
to his feet. He stood at parade rest 
for a moment; then he shrank back, 
hands raised half in supplication, 
half to ward a blow. 

“I didn’t cringe,” said Corbell. 
“Yes, cringe. It is a formal show 
of respect.” 

Ktollisp sang, “So we got an ex- 
pert genius and he rewrote all the 
programs, but we always got results 
that looked like these: Oh you need 
little teeny eyes for reading teeny 
print like you need little teeny 
license plates for bees !” 

It was pink-and-black dusk in the 
park. The Boys had returned early 
this day. They spent most of every 
day in Sarash-Zillish, going through 
buildings like a flock of wild birds. 
Exploring, Corbell had thought. 
Savages swarming through ruins 
they could not understand. 

He’d soon lost that illusion. A 
pair of Boys had escorted him out- 
side the hospital operating room 
while the others worked inside. 
When he was allowed back in, Cor- 
bell’s scalpel-spear had been reat- 
tached. The many-jointed arms 
above the operating table were care- 
fully carving a phantom patient. 

He was not allowed to watch re- 
pairs, but he had seen the results. 

75 




The refrigerator in the police build- 
ing, restored. A factory tested, run 
through its cycle until it had built 
two “phone booths”. The Boys did 
Corbell the signal honor of letting 
him test the booths. He had not 
tried to balk. Another factory had 
produced a Bathroom, a complete 
unit with pool and sauna. The Boys 
had repaired and tested the city 
lighting. Now the sides of many 
buildings glowed with soft yellow- 
white light. Others remained dark. 
The effect was eerie: a city-sized 
chessboard. 

They lived like savages, but ap- 
parently it was from choice. 

In camp Corbell had done his 
share of the work, hauling firewood 
and digging up roots. They had 
given him a loincloth, but they 
would not give him a knife to re- 
place his scalpel-spear. He still 
didn’t know what place he held 
among them. He feared the worst. 
They were too intelligent. They 
would see him as a lesser being, an 
animal. 

He needed them. It wasn’t just 
company he needed. He could not 
travel safely until he knew some- 
thing about this new continent. 

The boy was singing all the ver- 
ses, to the muted laughter of his 
companions. Corbell said, “Sooner 
or later I’ll run out of songs. 
Sooner.” 

Skatholtz shrugged. “It is all 
the same. We leave here when light 
comes again. We go to other . 
tribes? To tell them that Sarash- 
Zillish is ready for the long night. 
You come with us.” 

“Night? Is it night that’s com- 
ing?” Had he landed in autumn, 
then? 

76 



“Yes. So you came from space, 
unready! I thought that. Yes, the 
long day is ended and the short 
day-nights are with us and the long 
night comes near. In the long night 
we live in the city. Hunters go to 
the forests around, and food will 
keep in the cold boxes. In day we 
live more as we like.” 

“What’s it like out there?” 

“You will see.” Skatholtz picked 
up a passing cat-tail and stroked its 
fur. “We have time to teach you 
some speaking,” he said, and he 
switched to the language Corbell 
had tagged Boyish. Corbell was 
agreeable. He enjoyed language 
lessons. 

* * * 

Morning: they moved out. There 
was incredibly little fuss. They all 
seemed to wake at once. Soup had 
been simmering all night, made to 
Corbell’s recipe, which they liked. 
Breakfast was soup in coconut 
shells. They picked up pots, cloth, 
the fire starter, half a dozen edged 
weapons. One, an albino with pink 
eyes and cottony golden hair, 
handed Corbell twenty pounds of 
jerked meat wrapped in cloth. They 
left. 

Marching awakened Corbell 
fully. He had to drive himself to 
keep up, though the Boys made no 
attempt to set a steady pace. They 
ambled. Some dodged into build- 
ings, then jogged to rejoin the tribe. 

Savages they were not. They car- 
ried an idiosyncratic variety of 
edged tools, no two alike: scimitars, 
machetes, sabres, shapes that had 
no name, all with carefully sculpted 
handles. They had made the jerky 

GALAXY 




the way Corbel 1 would have, in an 
oven set on Low. The cloth they 
carried was indestructible stuff as 
thin as fine silk. Krayhayft’s 
flashlight/fire starter projected light 
of variable intensity, in a conical 
beam or a beam no thicker than a 
pencil. 

Organized they were not. But 
they had broken camp in minutes! 

They tramped through silent 
streets. Ingrowths of jungle grew 
thicker about them, until the city 
became jungle. They passed a 
straight tree trunk that Corbell sud- 
denly realized was vine-wrapped 
metal. He looked up to see where it 
joined other members in a hexa- 
gonal array: a part of the old dome. 

The jungle bore fruit: small 
oranges, breadfruit, several kinds of 
nuts. The Boys ate as they walked, 
and picked raw nuts to replace the 
roasted nuts they carried. They 
talked among themselves. Corbell 
couldn’t follow their speech; it went 
too fast. 

He strode along in their midst, 
keeping the pace he’d set himself. 
Incredible, the way his old body 
had healed! Tomorrow the aches 
would come; tomorrow he might 
not be able to move, except he’d 
damn well better. Today he felt 
fine. He felt like a scout-master 
leading his troop. Memo: Don’t test 
your authority. 

Three hours or so into the 
hike . and that could almost be a 
fight developing up ahead. 
Skatholtz and another Boy were 
spitting syllables at each other with 
unwonted vehemence. 

Last night’s singer loped to join 
them. Ktollisp was a burly, big- 
chested Boy with Skatholtz’s black 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



man’s features and everybody’s pale 
skin. He snapped one word at the 
two and they shut up. 

Ktollisp looked about him; 
frowned; pointed. The troop went 
off in that direction. They found a 
clearing, a few bushes growing on 
otherwise bare ground. Corbell 
watched, not understanding, as the 
troop formed a circle and Skatholtz 
and the other Boy stepped into it. 

What was this, a duel? The two 
dropped their knives and breech- 
clouts (no pubic hair). They circled 
like wrestlers. The challenger 
kicked at Skatholtz’s heart. 
Skatholtz swerved clear . and 
now it was happening too fast to 
follow. Fists and feet and elbows 
struck to kill: a momentary hold 
broken by an elbow between the 
eyes, the challenger kicked off bal- 
ance and handspringing clear; 
Skatholtz jumping full over a bush 
and then using it as a shield. It 
looked like a damned dance! But 
Skatholtz was favoring one leg, and 
the other Boy was circling faster. 
He was going to run him down. 

He caught a kick in the face as 
he closed. Skatholtz moved in for 
the kill. 

Ktollisp barked one word. 

The bloody-nosed Boy cringed 
before Skatholtz, held the pose a 
moment, then straightened. 

Everyone got up and started mov- 
ing again. Someone else was carry- 
ing Skatholtz’s cumbersome pack of 
cloth. His opponent was grinning 
and wiping at a bloody nose. 

* * * 

In midafternoon Skatholtz said 
two words Corbell recognized. He 
said, “Stop talk.” 



77 




They did. Now the silence of 
their march was uncanny. 

Skatholtz dropped back to walk 
beside Corbell. Very quietly he 
said, in Boyish, “You walk too 
loudly.” 

“I can’t help it. Are we hiding 
from something?” 

“From dinner we hide. Earlier 
was too early. We did not want to 
carry food so far. If something 
moves, let me know.” 

Corbell nodded. He didn’t expect 
to see anything. It would be months 
before his brain could train his eyes 
to see what the Boys could see in 
familiar territory. The keen-eyed 
Indian sees things the white man 
can’t, but only in his own environ- 
ment. 

Two boys transferred their loads 
to others and slipped away. Corbell 
couldn’t see where they had 
gone ... but presently there was a 
weird and terrifying sound, like a 
clarinet screaming for help. Every 
boy instantly moved off the trail to 
flatten against a tree. Corbell copied 
them. 

The tortured clarinet sounded 
nearer. They heard breaking wood. 
What would emerge? A tentacled 
monster, descendant of aliens en- 
slaved by a younger, space- 
travelling State? 

The monster burst from the trees. 
It was crippled, its forelegs running 
blood, hamstrung. The boys fol- 
lowed it, first the hunters and then 
the rest, slashing at its hind legs. 

A baby elephant! 

Corbell caught up in time to see 
the death. It was murder; it left him 
sick to his stomach. He fought his 
squeamishness and moved close to 
examine the corpse. The beast was 

78 



wrinkled and marked by old scars] 
No baby, this. It was an adujf 
elephant four feet tall at the should 
der. 

He asked Skatholtz, “Can | 
help?” >. 

“You may not butcher. I can not 
let you touch a knife. You are not aj; 
dikt, Corbell. You are nothing w© 
know.” 

“Today I kill nobody.’’ He 
meant it as a joke, but he didn’t 
know enough Boyish to phrase it 
that way. 

Skatholtz said, “And tomorrow? 

I think you make fiction-to- 
entertain, but lives might end if I 
am wrong. Do you understand my j 
speech?’ ’ j 

“I will learn.” He knew that 
Skatholtz was using baby-talk for 
his benefit. 

“Do you know the chkintl” 

“ Elephant . When I was young 
they were bigger, higher than your 
head at the shoulder.” He wondered 
how elephants had come to An tare* 
tica. Not as meat animals, surely.' 
Maybe there had been a zoo . 

Skatholtz looked dubious. “There 
are larger beasts in the se^t, but how, 
could such a beast live on land! 
without support? Still ... I havi* 
wondered why the elephant's leg® 
are so thick. Was it to suppoi* , 
larger weight?’ ’ j| I 

“Yes. The legs were more thic£fj j 
when I was young. The beast wasil 
the biggest on land. Five milliosB I 
years ago — ” he had divided by® I 
twelve, for Jupiter years — “ther^H 
were beasts far larger. We havaH 
found the bones turned to rock i(flj 
the earth.” ■ 

Skatholtz laughed skeptically andH 
left him. ifl 



GAI 




Having finished butchering the 
elephant, they departed. Corbell 
carried a rack of ribs for awhile, but 
it slowed him down. A disgusted 
tribesman finally took it away from 
him. 

The forest ended. 

Far across a prairie of waving 
yellowish-red vegetation, Corbell 
saw a last sliver of the departing 
sun. Jupiter was a pinkish-white 
disk, rising. 

Here they made camp. Presently 
Corbell ate roasted elephant for the 
first time in his life. He was too 
tired to sing for his supper. Some- 
one was telling a story — it was 
Krayhayft, who had oriental eyes 
and white patches gleaming in his 
straight black hair — and the others 
were listening in intense concentra- 
tion, when Corbell dropped off to 
sleep. 

★ ★ ★ 

They tramped all the next day 
through waving pinkish-yellow 
grain. Corbell judged it wheat. 
“Who grows this?” he asked 
Skatholtz, and was answered with 
laughter. 

Wheat took cultivation, didn’t it? 
Maybe it had been gene-altered. 
Four gene-altered cats still lived 
among the tribe; they took their 
turns riding the necks of various 
tribesmen. A wheat that grew wild 
would be worth having: more useful 
than a cat that was all tail. 

All day Corbell saw kangaroos 
and ostriches bounding through the 
wheat. They were fast and wary. 
Late in the day Krayhayft found the 
tracks of something larger. The 
tribe followed. Near sunset their 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



quarry came in sight: a big, sham- 
bling mass that ran from them on four 
legs until it turned at bay on two. 

It was a bear. Its skin was hair- 
less and yellow but for a mane of 
thick white fur. A nude polar bear? 
And no dwarf, either. It waddled 
toward the hunters and tried to maul 
them with its great claws. 

It was fighting Homo superior in 
the prime of health and youth. They 
danced around it, slashing. It fought 
on long after it should have bled to 
death. 

They ate bear meat that night, 
while the cat-tails hunted at the 
edge of firelight. Jupiter was full, 
banded and orange. 

Corbell was dozing with a full 
belly when Ktollisp dropped beside 
him. He spoke slowly, enunciating. 
“Do you sing tonight?” 

“If I choose, then no.” 
“Acceptable. What was this 
about growing grain?” 

“The grain we used didn’t grow 
without human help.” 

“Like Skatholtz, I do not read 
your face well. If this is fiction- 
for-entertainment, you do it well. 
We will be sorry to lose you.” 
“How do you lose me?” The 
boy might mean only that dikta die 
sooner or later, like cat-tails. 

No: Ktollisp said, “When we 
reach the dikta, we lose you.” 
Corbell hadn’t counted on that. 
“How many days?” 

“Four. Five if we stop for 
amusement somewhere. You will 
like the dikta, Corbell. There are 
men and women and the making of 
new Boys between them. They have 
a city and some country around, but 
they are not smart enough to make 
the machines go. In day we fix the 

79 




things that go wrong at night.” 

‘‘They’re not smart enough? 
They are the same . kind you 
are. Their heads should be built the 

same.” 

‘‘They have the brain, the stuff 
inside the heads, just like us. They 
do not have the time. We do not 
tell them how to fix machines. They 
do not live long enough to learn, 
and they might break the machines 
learning, and we punish them if 
they leave. So they stay in the dikta 
place. They need us. We know 
where to find them. We must know 
this because we must bring new 
boys to the tribes.” 

“What happens to the . small 
ones not boys?” 

“The girls ? They grow. Some 
boys grow too. We choose the best, 
the smartest and the strongest, one 
from each tribe for each year, and 
we send them back to the dikta. We 
do not do the thing to them that 
makes them stay the same forever.” 

Planned breeding for superior 
boys . and it would tend to cow 
the young Turks, to the benefit of 
the leaders. Corbell said, “There 
must be a lot more women than 
men.” 

Ktollisp grinned. “You like 
that?” 

Anger tied his tongue. “You — 
you joke! I die of being too old 
soon! 1 can’t make more boys!” 

Ktollisp had Corbell by the hair, 
his knife was drawn, before Corbell 
could do more than gasp. He 
slashed — 

— slashed away a thick handful of 
Corbell’ s hair and held it before his 
eyes. “Your lies are for the newly 
bom. We are offended,” he said. 
“Can you lie as to this?” The thin 



white hair he held in firelight was 
dark brown for half an inch at the 
roots. 

Corbell gaped. 

The tribe surrounded him. They 
must have been listening all the 
time. Yes, they looked offended. 
Skatholtz said, “No dikt grows hair 
like that. You have found the dikta 
way to live long like Boys, that we 
know only in tales. We must know 
what and where it is.” 

Corbell had forgotten his Boyish, 
every word. In English he cried, “I 
haven’t the remotest idea!” 

Ktollisp slapped him. 

Corbell tried to block with his 
arms. “Wait, wait. You’re right, I 
must have taken dikta immortality. I 
just don’t know where. Maybe, 
maybe it’s in something I ate. The 
dikta did a lot of gene engineering. 
They made the cat-tails and the wild 
wheat. Maybe they made something 
that grows dikta immortality, some- 
thing that grows in Sarash-Zillish. 
Listen, I didn’t know it was happen- 
ing! I can’t see my own hair!” 
Skatholtz was gesturing the rest 
back. “You could not feel your 
youth returning?” 

“I thought I was . getting 
adapted to the rough life. I spent 
like a hundred and thirty years in a 
cold-sleep tank, ten years at a 
time ... my years, not yours. I 
couldn’t know what it did to me. 
Listen, there’s an old woman who’s 
been searching every city in the 
world for dikta immortality. If she 
doesn’t know, how could I?” 

“We know nothing of this wom- 
an. All right, Corbell. Tell your 
story. Leave nothing out.” 

He had been sleepy. Now he was 
scared boneless . and still 



80 



GALAXY 




bone- weary . and in that state 
Corbell told his life’s story. 
Whenever he paused for breath 
Skatholtz spat complex phrases in 
Boyish, translating. 

Telling savages about a black 
hole at the center of a galaxy was 
easier than he had expected. Telling 
Mirelly-Lyra’s tale was wearing. 
They kept backing him up for 
points she hadn’t mentioned, for 
points she hadn’t even noticed in 
her thirst for Dictator immortality. 
They found her lack of curiosity 
incomprehensible . 

Questions. What had he eaten? 
Drunk? Breathed? Could immortali- 
ty have been in the Bath in One City? 
It was a mistake to mention the 
Fountain of Youth ... but no, the 
dikta themselves used Baths . 

Dawn came and Corbell was still 
talking. “It could have been any of 
the things I tried. The fruits, the 
nuts, the roots, the meat. The soup, 
even; I mean the combination of a 
lot of things plus the heat. Hell, it 
could even be the water in the foun- 
tain.” 

Skatholtz stood and stretched. 
“We can find out. When we return 
to Sarash-Zillish we will take a 
dikt. Shall we go?” 

“Go?” Corbell saw that the other 
Boys were getting up, collecting 
gear. “Oh, please! I’ll fall over!” 

“You are stronger than you 
think, Corbell. No longer are you a 
dikt sick with age.” 

They marched. 

The wheat-covered prairie went 
on forever. 

They camped early, after the 
afternoon rain. Corbell sprawled in 
the wet earth and slept like a dead 
man.

He woke early. A cat-tail had 
crawled along his ribs, liking the 
warmth, tickling him. It mewed in 
protest as he rolled away. There 
was more protest from his overused 
muscles. 

The fire had died. Jupiter, white 
with a thin red crescent edge, made 
the night seem bright. 

Well, I’m in trouble again, he 
thought. Imagine my amazement. 
Everyone in the world wants Dic- 
tator immortality, and they all think 
I’ve got it, and they’re all half 
right. Why do the Boys want it? 
Maybe they want to destroy it. It’s 
the biggest difference between them 
and the dikta . 

He let his hand stroke the orange 
cat-tail. It draped itself over his 
knee and rumbled contentedly. 

What is it? If it’s edible it’s in 
Sarash-Zillish. Everything I ate in 
Four City, Mirelly-Lyra ate too. 
One kind for women and one for 
men? and man’s immortality doesn’t 
affect women at all? I don't believe 
it. 

So something in the park holds 
Dictator immortality, in the sap or 
the juice or the blood, and / ate it. 
What did she eat when she searched 
Sarash-Zillish? The Boys eat almost 
no vegetables . and vegetarians 
eat no meat . but she fed me 
both, and fruit too. Insects? I don’t 
eat insects. 

If I could get her to Sarash- 
Zillish, I'd know. Watch her. See 
what she doesn’t eat. 

The stars were bright tonight. A 
few unwinking stars had a pinkish 
tinge: small Jovian moons. The 

GALAXY 




boys were sprawled far from where 
the fire had been. A boy on guard 
looked around as Corbell sat up. It 
was Krayhayft, the only Boy with 
white in his hair. 

Heady smells reached Corbell. 
Wet earth and growing things, 
traces of young supermen who 
hadn’t washed recently, a ghost of 
broiled meat that Corbell hadn’t 
shared: suddenly he was hungry. 
And suddenly he was elated. 

“What the hell am I complaining 
about?” he whispered. The cat-tail 
stopped purring to listen. “I’m 
young! If nothing else works I can 
outrun the bitch! I should be danc- 
ing in the streets, if I could find a 
street.” 

Young again! That made twice. If 
he could find out how he did it, he 
could stay young for the rest of his 
life. Everybody’s dream. And even 
if he couldn’t ... the grin died on 
his face. Now he had fifty years to 
protect, half a century of lifespan 
that the Norn would rip from him if 
he couldn’t show her the Tree of 
Life in Sarash-Zillish. 

Something that tasted funny? Ev- 
erything tasted funny. Different 
soil. Three million years of change. 

It was too damn simple anyway. 
Immortality? And you drink it like 
fruit juice? An injection might have 
been more plausible, if he had re- 
cieved any kind of injection. 
Or . had he inhaled it like 
marijuana, in the smoke from the 
wood of a carefully genetailored 
tree? 

“Corbell. Do you enjoy the 
morning?’ ’ 

Corbell jumped violently. The 
sentry’s approach had been perfectly 
silent. He settled beside Corbell. By 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



Jupiter light the pale threads 
gleamed in his hair. Corbell had 
wondered at the grace with which 
he moved: Krayhayft who carried 
the fire starter, Krayhayft the story 
teller. 

“How old are you?” 

“Twenty-one,” said Krayhayft. 

“That’s old,” said Corbell. Jupi- 
ter years. “I wonder why you 
aren’t the leader.” 

“The old ones leant to avoid that 
chore . and to avoid the fighting 
that goes with it. Skatholtz can beat 
me. Skill in fighting has an upper 
limit. One is born with one’s 
greatest possible strength.” 

“Oh.” 

“Corbell, I think I have found 
your spacecraft.” 

“What?” 

“There.” The boy was pointing 
low on the northern horizon, where 
a few stars glowed in the grey-black 
of coming dawn. One showed pink 
among blue-tinged stars. “The one 
that might be a moon except that it 
does not move. Is that your space- 
craft?” 

“No. I don’t know where my 
ship went. Don Juan wasn’t ball- 
like. It would look more like a thick 
spear. ’ ’ 

Krayhayft was more puzzled than 
disappointed. “Then what is it? I 
have seen it twinkle oddly. It does 
not move, but it grows more bright 
every night.” 

“The whole system of worlds is 
messed up. I can’t explain it. I 
think that’s the next world out from 
Jupiter. ’ ’ 

“I wish it had been your space- 
craft,” said Krayhayft. He fell to 
studying the steady point of light. 
Entranced ...

The cat-tail slithered from Cor- 
bell’s knee and disappeared into the 
grain. Corbell saw two more low 
shadows slipping after it. 

A cat screamed. Simultaneously 
something much bigger vented a 
much lower, coughing roar. 
Krayhayft shouted, “Alert!” 

It bounded out of the grain and 
leapt at Corbell’s throat: something 
as big as the biggest of dogs. Cor- 
bell threw himself to the side. He 
saw a spear plant itself solidly in 
the open mouth, and then the Boys 
were on it. It was a dwarf lion, 
male, magnificently maned. It died 
fast. Even the first spear might have 
killed it. 

Corbell got up, shaken. “The 
female could be out there.” 

Skatholtz said, “Yes,” and 
joined the others who were fanning 
out into the grain. Corbell, spearless 
and superfluous, stayed where he 
was. 

Presently he noticed something 
small in the path the lion’s charge 
had left through grain. He found a 
small butterscotch- sundae-colored 
corpse. The other cat-tails had re- 
turned to the fire. They seemed un- 
usually subdued. 

* * * 

At Dawn he helped two Boys 
build a fire. He saw the reason lat- 
er, when four more trekked in with 
ostrich eggs. They set the eggs on 
the coals, carefully cut the tops off 
and stirred the contents with spear 
hafts. 

Scrambled eggs! Still no coffee. 

Corbell strode along in pink sun- 
light, feeling good. The slapping- 

84 



around was a bitter memory, with 
bruises to corroborate, but he set 
next to it another memory: Ktol- 
lisp’s fist holding white hair with 
dark brown roots. Oh, for a mirror! 
He was a slave, if not worse. But 
he was young! With an outside 
chance to stay that way a long, long 
time. 

They had crossed a row of big, 
badly weathered rocks, oddly tex- 
tured, big as houses and bigger. 
Now the land sloped down . and 
Corbell found Skatholtz marching 
beside him. Skatholtz said in En- 
glish, “What do you know of the 
Girls?” 

There was a Boyish word for 
girl-child and another for dikta 
woman, but Girl was a third word, 
and it carried a certain emphasis. 

Corbell answered, “Mirelly-Lyra 
told me something about them. 
There was a balance of power be- 
tween Boys and Girls, and some- 
how it fell apart.” 

“By her tale, the Girls ruled 
Boys as Boys rule dikta.” 

“No. Look at it with more care. 
The Girls ruled the sky; they could 
move the world. By implication 
they controlled the weather. They 
couldn’t change the world’s rota- 
tion, but they could decide how far 
the world should be from the sun. 
In fact, they first moved the world 
because the sun was getting too hot. 

“The Boys ruled the dikta. They 
could see to it that no more Boys or 
Girls were born.” An interesting 
role- reversal, that. “In itself that 
isn’t a lot of power, not in a 
crowded world where everyone ex- 
pects to live forever any way — ’ ’ 
“But our land was less rich! The 
tales tell it so!” 



GALAXY 




“Yeah. Look at it from the other 
direction. Suppose the Boys let the 
dikta breed like rabbits — breed fast. 
They kill most of the girl-children 
and hide most of the boy-children. 
The boy-children grow up. They get 
dikta immortality as long as they 
behave. Now the Boys have an 
army. They invade.” 

The land had leveled out. Ahead 
it sloped upward again. Skatholtz 
mulled it over, then, “Our tales tell 
nothing of this.” 

“That’s because it never hap- 
pened. The Boys couldn’t feed such 
an army. Poor land. So the balance 
of power lasted . oh, tens of 
thousands of your years.” 

“I see, partly. I am not used to 
thinking like this. What went 
wrong? Somehow the Girls lost con- 
trol.” 

“Yeah. Weather?” 

“Our tales tell of a great thaw- 
ing. When green things grew for the 
first time in our land, the Girls tried 
to take it. The thaw happened when 
the Girls grew too proud. In their 
pride they lost a moon, and with the 
moon they lost their power. ’ ’ 

Corbell laughed. “They lost a 
moon ? Hey, just how accurate could 
those tales be after ... a hundred 
thousand years?” 

“We live long. We remember 
well. Details may be lost, but we 
do not add fiction.” 

The land sloped upward. In the 
distance Corbell could see another 
line of big, melted-looking rocks. 

“A moon. It sounds completely 
silly, but . Peerssa told me the 
moons of Jupiter were out of their 
orbits, but that’s not too strange. 
Dropping the world into their midst 
could have done that. But he also 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



said Ganymede is missing com- 
pletely.” 

“Ganymede?” 

“The biggest moon. Hell, I don’t 
see how it fits in.” 

“And the sun is too hot, you 
said, and King Jupiter is too hot.” 
“And the weather is screwed 
up,” said Corbell. “It all comes 
down to a change in the weather. It 
wiped out the balance of power. 
Then the Boys wiped out the 
Girls.” 

“We tell tales of that war. 
Weapons as strong as a meteor 
strike! Look, Corbell, such a 
weapon was used here.” Skatholtz 
swept an arm behind him. 

They had crossed a shallow 
dish-shaped depression a couple of 
miles across, rimmed by these 
half-melted . “Just a minute,” 
said Corbell. He dropped his load 
of jerky and scrambled up a rock 
twenty feet high and of oddly uni- 
form texture. There at the top he 
found lines of rust red making a 
great Z: the remains of a girder. 

“These were buildings,” he said. 
“It must have been a Boy city.” 
“When I was young I wanted to 
use weapons like that.” Skatholtz 
laughed boyishly. “Now I cringe at 
what they must have done to the 
weather. But we destroyed the 
Girls.” 

“They did you some hurt too.” 
Corbell climbed down from the 
melted building. They’d have to trot 
to catch up to the tribe. 

“The tale tells that they de- 
stroyed us,” said Skatholtz. “I 
never understood that saying.” 
Corbell and Skatholtz marched in 
silence for a time. Boys chattered 
ahead. It was just past noon, too 



85 




early to hunt. Very far away, a 
great brown carpet flowed away 
from the noise they were making: 
thousands of animals too distant to 
recognize, too numerous to count. 

Skatholtz said in Boyish, “Soon 
we reach the border to the great wa- 
ter. A day’s march broad is that 
border. The word is — ” Corbell 
learned the words for shore and 
sea. “The near village holds a 
pleasant surprise,” and Skatholtz 
used another unfamiliar word. “I 
can’t describe it. We must do work 
for it.” 

“All right.” In his youth Corbell 
had never liked muscle work. But 
oh, it was good to have the muscles 
now! He asked, “Why were we 
talking English?” 

“Because I must know you. I 
must learn when you are telling fic- 
tion.” 

He chose not to protest the injus- 
tice. “I wonder about the cat-tails.” 
“What do you wonder?” 

“In Sarash-Zillish they rule. Here 
there are things bigger and more 
violent. How can they live?” 

“Soon or late a predator kills 
them. Until then they are pleasant 
to keep near. Soon or late, every- 
thing dies except Boys.” 

“Before this evil you control 
your rage skillfully. Will we find 
more cat-tails among the dikta?” 
“No. We never leave cat-tails 
with the dikta.” 

“Why?” 

“It isn’t done.” 

Corbell let it drop. There was a 
thing he dared not ask yet, but he 
would have to find out. How care- 
fully were the adults guarded? 

The dikta place was the second 
place Mirelly-Lyra would look for 

86 



him. He couldn’t stay long. The 
moment she saw him dark-haired, 
that moment he would have to pro- 
duce Dictator immortality. 

And maybe he could. One simple 
test . made carefully! He did not 
want the Boys chopping down the 
Tree of Life!” 



V 

They reached the village at noon. 
It was a strange blend of primitive 
and futuristic: an arc of Baths, iden- 
tical to the Bath Corbell had found 
by the shore in One City, half- 
surrounding the village square, and 
surrounded in turn by sod huts and 
granaries. There was great variety 
among the sod structures; but they 
matched. The village as a whole 
was beautiful. 

Corbell was beginning to get the 
idea. The ancient factories would 
build the Boys buildings for certain 
purposes. It was very easy to go on 
using them century after century. 
For other purposes they made their 
own, and lavished labor and in- 
genuity on them. He was not en- 
tirely surprised when Krayhayft 
spoke for the tribe, and called it 
“Krayhayft’s tribe.” He who spoke 
for the village had Krayhayft’s 
strange grace, and gray in his long 
golden hair. 

They worked all that afternoon. 
A couple of boys from the village 
went with them to supervise, shout- 
ing their orders with malice 
aforethought. Corbell and 
Krayhayft’s tribe used primitive 
scythes to reap grain from the fields 
and carry it in bundles into the vil- 
lage square, until there was a great 

GALAXY 




heap of it there, until the Boys of 
the village were satisfied. 

After their labor the Boys went 
whooping to the Baths. Corbell 
waited his turn with impatience. He 
went the full route, bath and steam 
and sauna and back to the bath with 
the Jacuzzi-style bubble system 
turned on. When he emerged it was 
dark. They were starting dinner. 

The “surprise” was bread, of 
course. Several kinds of bread, plus 
rabbit meat the villagers had 
hunted. Corbell ate his fill of all the 
varieties. The taste brought on a 
nostalgic mood. His eyes were wet 
when Ktollisp had finished singing 
Corbell’s version of “Poisoning Pi- 
geons in the Park.” 

The bread had surprised him less 
than the “phone booth” at one end 
of the arc of Baths. He dithered 
. but Skatholtz knew he knew 
about “phone booths”. While 
Krayhayft started one of his long 
tales, Corbell sought out Skatholtz 
and asked him. 

The skeletal boy grinned. “Were 
you thinking of leaving us through 
the prilatsil ?' ’ 

“Not especially.” 

“Of course not. Well, you’ve 
guessed right. This village trades 
their grain for other bread-makings 
all across the land.” 

“I didn’t think the Prilatsil could 
send that far.” 

“The land is crossed by a line of 
Prilatsil, close-spaced. Do you 
think we would handle emergencies 
by traveling on foot? Look — ” 
Skatholtz drew a ragged circle — 
Antarctica — and a peace symbol or 
chicken ’s-footprint within it. “If 
there were serious reason to travel, 
these lines of Prilatsil exist. Since 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



the time of the Girls they have been 
used four times . more, if tales 
have been lost. We keep them in 
repair.” 

Corbell kept his other questions 
to himself. He hoped he would not 
have to use the Prilatsil. They were 
too obvious. 

When they left in the morning, 
three of Krayhayft’s tribe had 
stayed behind, and three of the vil- 
lagers had come with them. No big 
deal was made of it, and Corbell 
had to examine faces to be sure it 
had happened. They carried loaves 
of bread in their cloth bags. 

* + * 

Now there was no more grain. 
The land dropped gradually for 
twenty miles or more, and ended in 
mist. Nothing grew on it but dry 
scrub. Off to the right of their path 
was a cluster of sharp-edged shapes, 
promontories all alone on the flat 
lifeless ground. 

Nature sometimes imitates the 
regular, artificial look. Corbell 
asked anyway. 

“They are artificial,” Skatholtz 
told him. “I have seen them before. 
I have my guess as to what they 
are, but . shall we look at them? 
Some of Krayhayft’s tribe have not 
seen them.” 

The troop veered. The structures 
grew larger. Some lay on their 
sides, disintegrating. But the nearest 
stood upright, its narrow bottom 
firmly set in the ground. The tribe 
clustered beneath a great curved 
wall leaning out over their heads. 

“Ships,” said Corbell. “They 
carried people and things over wa- 
ter. What are they doing so far from 
the ocean?” 



87 





“Perhaps there was ocean here 
once.” 

“Yeah . yeah. When the 
World got so hot, a lot of the ocean 
went into the air. This used to be 
sea-bottom mud, I think it was part 
of the continental shelf.” 

Krayhayft said, “That fits with 
the tales. Can you guess what they 
might have carried?” 

“Too many answers. Is there a 
way in?” 

He didn’t understand when 
Krayhayft untied the fire starter 
from his belt. He would have 
stopped him otherwise. Krayhayft 
twisted something on the fire star- 
ter, pointed it at the great wall of 
rusted metal. 

The metal flared. Corbell said 
nothing; it was already too late. He 
watched the thin blue beam spurt 
fire until Krayhayft had cut a wide 
door. 

The metal slab fell away. Tons of 
mud spilled after it. Aeons of dust 
and rainwater . They waded up 
the mud slope, joking among them- 
selves, and Corbell followed. 

The hull was one enormous tank. 
There were no partitiions to prevent 
sloshing. Corbell sniffed, but no 
trace of the cargo remained. Oil? Or 
something more exotic? Or only 
topsoil for the frigid Antarctic 
cities? Topsoil wouldn’t slosh 
around . 

The surprise was on deck and 
above deck. Masts! There was no 
place here for human sailors. There 
were only proliferating masts re- 
miniscent of clipper ships, and ca- 
bles all running to a great housing 
at the bow. A housing for motors 
and winches and a computer. 

The hull had apparently been 

GALAXY 



sound; the masts were in fine shape. 
But time had reduced the computer 
to garbage. That was a pity. It was 
as big as Don Juan’s computer that 
had housed Peerssa’s personality. 
Conceivably it could have told them 
a great deal. 

* * * 

They marched down into the fog, 
and the fog swallowed them. 

Corbell heard regular booming 
sounds which he failed to interpret. 
Then, suddenly, they had reached 
the sea. Breakers roared and hissed 
across a rocky shore. 

They rested. Then, while others 
collected brush for a fire, three of 
the Boys swam out into the breakers 
with spears and the rope. It looked 
inviting. The water would not be 
cold. But Corbell had seen the Boys 
hunt, and he wondered what toothy 
prey waited for them. 

Two came back. They swam 
ashore with the rope twitching be- 
hind them, and collapsed, panting 
heavily, while others dragged the 
rope in with its thrashing burden. 
They beached twelve feet of shark. 
The third Boy didn’t come back. 

Corbell couldn’t believe it. How 
could immortals be so careless of 
their lives? 

The Boys were subdued, but they 
held no kind of formal ceremony. 
Corbell ate bread that night. He had 
no stomach for shark. He had seen 
what came out of the shark’s 
stomach. 

He lay long awake, puzzling it 
out. He had been old and young 
and middle-aged, in no intelligible 
sequence. With any luck he would 
stay young. He had fought for his 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



life and his lifestyle against the 
massed might of the State; he had 
never given up, not with all the ex- 
cuse in the world. 

Did they get tired of too much 
life? 

Corbell didn’t doubt that they 
could build machines to kill off the 
sharks. The factories that kept turn- 
ing out identical Bedrooms and 
Baths and Offices were a tribute to 
their laziness; but they were also 
brilliant. Then why were the sharks 
still here? Tradition? Machismo? 

In the morning the Boys were 
cheerful as ever. In the afternoon 
they reached the dikta. 

THE DICTATORS 
I 

Six City, Dikta City, showed first 
as a bar of shadow along the 
shoreline, then as half a mile of 
blank wall with a low windowed 
structure peeking above the center. 
Dikta City showed its back to the 
approaching Boys. 

As they rounded the end Corbell 
saw its face. Dikta City was a sin- 
gle building, four stories tall, half a 
mile long, and as thick as a luxury 
hotel. Its face looked north toward 
the sea and the sun, and was rich 
with windows and balconies -and 
archways. Between city and sea was 
a semicircle of low wall with the 
tops of trees visible within. 

The dikta were emerging through 
an arch in the low garden wall. In 
scores now, they waited. 

Dikta City could never have been 
under a dome. It was the wrong 
shape. The city must have been 
built late, in hothouse Antarctica, 
specifically to house the adults. 

89 




Topsoil had been spread over the 
salty, barren continental shelf, and 
walled against the winds. The sea 
and the garden within the wall 
would be the only food sources for 
miles around. It would be difficult 
to leave this place, Corbell thought. 

A couple of hundred dikta waited 
until the Boys were yards away, 
until Corbell had counted seven 
men among a horde of women. 
Then they cringed, all of them at 
once. They held the cringe as 
Krayhayft stepped forward alone. 

“We come to repair your 
machines,” Krayhayft said, “and to 
take your boy-children to our- 
selves.” 

“Good,” said one among them. 
He had a white beard and shoulder- 
length white hair, very clean and 
curly. He straightened from the 
cringe, and so did all the others 
. and now Corbell was im- 
pressed by their general health and 
dignity. They didn’t act like slaves; 
the cringe had been a formality. 
Corbell wondered what would have 
happened if he had cringed natural- 
ly, that fourth day in Sarash-Zillish. 
The Boys might have killed him as 
an escapee. 

All of the dikta were studying 
Corbell. 

Krayhayft noticed. He spoke at 
length in a voice that carried. Cor- 
bell couldn’t follow everything he 
said, but he was telling a condensed 
version of Corbell’s story. The 
spaceflight, the long voyage, some 
complex phrases that might have re- 
lated to relativistic time- 
compression; the flight from 
Mirelly-Lyra ... no mention of the 
mad dikta woman’s motives. No 
mention of dikta immortality. Cor- 

90 



bell was sure of that; he was listen- 
ing for it. 

The old man listened and 
laughed; he was vastly entertained. 
At the end he came forward and 
said, “Welcome to our refuge, 
Corbell. You will have interesting 
things to tell us. I am Gording. Do 
I speak slowly enough?” 

“A pleasure to meet you, Gord- 
ing. I have a lot to leam from you. 
Yes, I can understand you.” 

“Will you join us tonight, then? 
We have room in the Dikta Place 
for many more children. It will be 
instructive to see what your children 
are like.” 

“I — ” Corbell choked up. The 
women were examining him and 
speculating in whispers. It wasn’t 
just his browline, though even the 
women were half bald. His brown- 
and-white hair must have caught 
their attention too . and his an- 
swer was rudely delayed. “I’m 
happy you accept me for that impor- 
tant purpose,” he said. 

What he was was nervous. 
Abruptly he was very conscious of 
his near-nakedness. The dikta were 
entirely naked. 

One of the women — her long 
black hair was just showing grey — 
said, “It must be long since you 
made children with a woman.” 

Corbell laughed. Divide by 
twelve — “A quarter of a million 
years.” 

What she asked then raised laugh- 
ter. Corbell shook his head. “I may 
have forgotten how. There is only 
one way to know.” 

He helped the Boys set up camp. 

The garden was a semicircle 
within the wall, far more orderly 
than the jungle in Sarash-Zillish. A 

GALAXY 




grove of trees occupied the center. 
The Boys set up camp under the 
trees, and built their fire with wood 
brought by dikta women. 

“You may go to the dikta,” 
Skatholtz told him then, “but you 
must not tell them of dikta immor- 
tality.” It didn’t seem to occur to 
him that he might be disobeyed. 

“What about my hair? I know 
damned well they noticed it.” 

Skatholtz shrugged. “You are an 
early type of dikt from before 
stories were told. Tell them all dikta 
once grew hair like yours. If any 
leam what you know, their minds 
will be . all that they know will 
be taken from them.” 

“I’ll keep my mouth shut.” 

They were surprising enough. 
Like the Boys, they had pallid, al- 
most translucent skin, coupled to all 
the shapes natural to human beings: 
noses broad and narrow, lips thick 
or thin, bushy eyebrows or eyes 
with epicanthic folds, bodies burly 
and invulnerable or slender and 
fragile . 

“Vitamin D!” Corbel! said sud- 
denly. He tried to explain: “Your 
skin makes a thing you need, from 
sunlight. A hundred thousand years 
of red sunlight has turned you white 
by killing people when their skin 
was too dark to let sunlight in. 
Even so, you need your skin bare 
all the time.” 

The women were nodding. Cord- 
ing said, “A life-chemical, 
kathope.” 

“But how do you live in the long 
night?” Almost six years! 

“Kathope seed. We press it for 
the oil,” said Gording. 

Escaping Dikta City should have 
been easier in the long night, when 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



the Boys all gathered in Sarash- 
Zillish. But fugitives would have to 
carry their own kathope seed- 
. yeah, and Boys would tear it 
up if they found it growing any- 
where but here or in Saxash-Zillish. 
Corbell was beginning to worry. 
Maybe he really was trapped. 

He asked about the coming fes- 
tivities. 

“We take sex in company,” 
T’teeruf told him. At a wild guess 
she was sixteen or so, her face 
heart-shaped, her eyes large and ex- 
pressive, her mouth full and made 
for laughter, her hair a tightly 
coiled ruff. Even she was half-bald. 
“Sex is the only pleasure we have 
that the Boys can’t ever understand. 
That, and giving birth.” Her eyes 
dropped shyly. “I haven’t done that 
yet.” 

II 

The orgy hall (what else could 
you call it?) was an afterthought. It 
seemed the Boys hadn’t thought of 
putting one in when they built Dikta 
City. The dikta had repaired the 
omission by building a kind of in- 
finity sign on the roof, composed of 
twelve of the mass-produced trian- 
gular bedrooms arranged like two 
pies of six wedges each, with two 
baths set between. They had 
knocked out all the inner walls. The 
small toilets that belonged to the 
bedrooms still had doors (at least 
the dikta kept that form of pri- 
vacy!), but the closets didn’t, and 
the “phone booths” had been rip- 
ped out. Of course. 

When Corbell arrived there were 
dikta on every horizontal surface, 
beds and couches and coffee tables, 



91 




and more coming in. Half a dozen 
women gestured invitation from one 
of the beds. Corbell accepted. 

His nervousness left him quickly. 
Rippling waterbed and warm 
woman-flesh formed his pillows, 
and it was altogether delightful. In 
courtesy and because she was 
nearest, he lay with an older woman 
first. She expressed no disappoint- 
ment, but he was too quick and he 
knew it. After all that time, to hur- 
ry .. and still it felt like a mighty 
victory. “I gave this up forever,” 
he said, and thanked her with his 
eyes. 

Now he beat his chest and war- 
bled the Challenge of the Great 
Ape, and now he took a woman 
with pronouncedly oriental features 
and warm, skilled hands. This time 
it was longer, better. Their partial 
baldness made them more exotic. 
Their breasts were alike, large in 
diameter but flattened; even in older 
women they did not sag. 

They asked him about his sensa- 
tions, Even with his wife Corbell 
had had difficulty analyzing his own 
reflexes, and he had trouble now. 
They probed delicately, with ques- 
tions and with stroking fingertips, 
exploring his ancient nervous sys- 
tem and telling him about their 
own. 

A younger man joined them. Two 
women left, were replaced by two 
more. Corbell scratched T’teeruf’s 
back while she was in sexual con- 
gress. Was he through for the 
night? 

Evidently not — 

The man was using his hands and 
toes too, attempting to satisfy five 
women at a time, reminding Corbell 
of old paintings from India. Egotist! 

92 



But it seemed fair, given the dis- 
tribution. When inspiration came, 
Corbell tried it himself. It took 
some concentration . and he had 
never been in practice. He was ten- 
tative, a bit clumsy. 

One of the women asked him 
about it. He told her. One woman 
to a man . monogamy ... no 
children’s immortality . The 
faces around him closed down like 
masks, and the woman changed the 
subject. 

He hardly noticed. He was drunk 
and euphoric on the hormones 
bubbling in his blood. He watched 
the other man and two women, try- 
ing to follow what they were doing, 
but it all came out as a tangle of 
arms and legs. 

“There are lost skills,” T’teeruf 
told him a bit wistfully. “Positions 
used in free fall. Now they exist 
only in the tales.” 

He tried the sauna (crowded) and 
the bathtub (crowded). Hot water 
churned with bubbles and the cur- 
rents generated by a couple on the 
far side: Gording and the older 
woman who had been his first since 
the corpsicle tank. Wet woman rub- 
bed against him. A water-splashing 
war erupted and died out. Corbell 
and a young woman with golden 
hair made love, sitting cross-legged 
in the tub facing each other. 

That was when he looked up and 
saw the Boys: half a dozen of them 
seated on the edge of an open air- 
well with their feet hanging down 
toward the tub. They passed com- 
ments to each other while they en- 
joyed the show. Ktollisp caught him 
looking and waved. 

The girl’s eyes followed Corbell’ s 
upward, then dropped in disinterest. 

GALAXY 




Okay, it didn’t bother 
her . When Ktollisp waved 
again, Corbell waved back. 

In the bedroom in One City there 
had been an old videotape of two 
couples demonstrating lovemaking 
positions. Even then Corbell had 
sensed the presence of an audience 
out of range. Now he knew. They 
had been there at the coffee table: 
Boys, or Girls watching borrowed 
dikta, or even (how old was that 
tape?) Boys and Girls mixed, before 
the great rift. 

The orgy’s impetus dwindled. 
Now half of Dikta City clustered on 
the beds and couches and coffee ta- 
bles in half of the Bedroom com- 
plex, questioning Corbell. His audi- 
ence thinned as some left by the 
stairwell; others went by twos and 
threes to the other multiple bed 
complex and came back later. Cor- 
bell talked on and on. The first man 
to see the bottom of the universe, 
he had his audience at last. 
Euphoria! 

Suddenly he was yawning uncon- 
trollably. 

No, they didn’t use the Bedrooms 
for sleeping. They slept in a 
ground-floor room. Gording volun- 
teered to walk him over. The fresh 
air cooled his damp body and 
cleared his head. The stars were 
slightly misted over. 

Gording pointed to a steady, 
pink-tinged star in the north. “Cor- 
bell, you came from space recently. 
What is that?” 

“A world like a little Jupiter. It 
shouldn’t be there, but it is.” 

“It grows brighter, but it does 
not move against the pattern of 
fixed stars.” 

“That bothered Krayhayft too.” 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



It was brighter, wasn’t it? “Listen, 
I’m too tired to think.” 

The sleeping room was a kind of 
greenhouse. The sleeping surface 
was tall grass, living grass, already 
covered by bodies. Gording and 
Corbell found space, lay down and 
slept. 

★ * ★ 

The sun shining through glass 
walls woke him. Four women were 
still curled on the grass, isolated. 
The rest were gone. 

He had daydreamed of nights like 
last night, when he was much 
younger. Without the bald heads, of 
course. So what? He was lucky they 
saw him as human. Lucky he could 
still see them as human, too. Their 
bodies hadn’t changed much. Their 
minds had changed more; they 
seemed geniuses . and they 
seemed placid in their slavery. 

If they hadn’t freed themselves 
from the Boys in all those eons, 
how could Corbell? Corbell remem- 
bered that there was a possible an- 
swer . that had to be tested. 

* * * 

A ceremony was in progress at 
the Boy encampment. Eight dikta 
males (he must have missed one 
yesterday) were presenting five 
boy-children to the tribe. Of the 
three cup-bearers, Krayhayft who 
seemed to be the oldest now seemed 
to be in charge. The rest of the 
Boys watched solemnly. Three car- 
ried the remaining cat-tails round 
their necks. 

Corbell decided against joining 
them; he took a place by himself 

93 




and kept his mouth shut. His chance 
would come. 

The children were five to seven 
years old. They seemed overawed 
and immensely proud. Of the 
adults, it was Gording who named 
each child and described him: his 
strength, his accomplishments, his 
habits good and bad. For a moment 
Corbell thought one of the children 
was being rejected, and that didn’t 
fit his preconceptions at all. Then 
he realised that the boy-child’s 
name had been rejected. He was 
being given a new one. 

The ceremony broke up suddenly. 
The boy -children stayed with the 
Boys; the men went off talking to- 
gether. Krayhayft called to Corbell. 
“I know that walk and that look.” 
Corbell went over. 

“The walk means you have used 
muscles in unaccustomed labor. I 
know the bright smile and red eyes 
too.” 

Corbell grinned. “You’re right.” 
“You had fun?” 

“You’ll never know.” 

“I never will. Some of the boy- 
children we take try to be the best 
so that they can be dikta. Do you 
believe that?” 

“Sure. Did you?” 

Krayhayft scowled. “It didn’t 
matter. I was not best at anything. I 
burnt food. My spear missed the 
prey. I don’t like to remember that 
long ago. I remember that I wanted 
to go home. What does a yearling 
know of the difference between liv- 
ing five years or six, and living 
forever?’ ’ 

“And sex:” 

“What does a yearling know of 
sex? What does a Boy know of sex? 
He can only watch.” Krayhayft 

94 



grinned suddenly. “Last night was 
the first time I ever saw — ” He beat 
his chest with his fists and gave an 
ululating yell. 

“The Tarzan act. I was a little 
crazy.” 

“That seems normal.” 

“What happens next? How long 
do you stay here?” 

“If some machine needs to be 
repaired, we stay. Otherwise we 
leave tomorrow. We have many 
tribes to meet, to tell them that 
Sarash-Zillish is ready for them.” 

★ ★ * 

Time was constricting for Cor- 
bell, but he dared not hurry. At the 
moment he had nothing to do at all. 
And everyone else was busy. 

On the second floor Boys had 
opened what might be a power 
generator. They ordered him away 
from their secrets. 

In another room women wove 
cloth of exceptional beauty and col- 
or. “During the long night we 
cover ourselves,” one told him. She 
refused to teach him how to weave. 
“The thread might cut off some of 
your fingers.” 

“It’s that strong?” 

“What would be the point of 
making cloth less durable?” 

He stole a loop of the thread, 
held it a moment, then put it back. 
Sure it’d make wonderful strangling 
cord, but where would he hide it? 

He wound up in the kitchen/ 
dining room complex, serving food 
and watching the cooks. He had 
been a pretty good cook once, but 
no sane chef would try to use 
someone else’s kitchen without 
exploring it first. And it was bad 

GALAXY 




news. The implements and measur- 
ing spoons were unfamiliar, of 
course. But the basic foods and the 
spices were also unfamiliar. He was 
going to have to learn to cook all 
over again. 

In midaftemoon a woman offered 
to relieve him at the serving 
counter. She took a second look and 
said, “You are unhappy.’’ 

“Right.” 

“Iam Charibil. Can I help?” 

He couldn’t tell her all his prob- 
lems. “There’s not much here I’m 
good for.” 

“Men don’t have to work if they 
don’t want to. You do have one 
useful talent. You can improve the 
variety of traits among us.” 

Their gene pool was a little 
skimpy, yeah. Though there was 
variety. Charibil herself had the 
epicanthic fold and small features of 
an oriental, though she was Cor- 
bell’s height. The uniformity was 
there too: pale skin, breasts wide 
and flat, half-bald scalp and curly 
black topknot, slender frame . 

She jumped suddenly to her feet. 
“Come to the orgy room, Corbell. 
You need cheering up. Is it dis- 
placement from your tribe that 
bothers you? Or fear of the ancient 
dikt and her cane?” 

“All of the above. Right, I need 
cheering up.” 

If he thought to be alone with 
Charibil, he was wrong. She called 
to three friends as they passed, and 
one joined them; and then a small 
golden-haired woman invited herself 
into the group; and four women 
presently reached the Bedroom 
complex with Corbell. Others were 
there; a man and a single woman 
who seemed to want to be alone. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



Charibil and the other woman sud- 
denly picked Corbell up by arms 
and legs, swung him wide and 
slung him through the air, laughing 
at his startled “Hey!” 

The surface surged as he splashed 
down, surged again as they joined 
him. He laughed with them. Only 
for a moment, the laugh caught in 
his throat. 

There was a mirror over the bed. 

He couldn’t have missed that last 
night . and he hadn’t. The others 
had those mobile sculptures over 
them. Had the women noticed any- 
thing? Corbell pulled Charibil 
against him, rolled onto his back 
with her on top . and looked up 
at himself. 

Long, thinning white hair sprang 
from a military haircut in chestnut 
brown, in the damndest hairdo Cor- 
bell had ever seen. In the face there 
were frown lines around the mouth 
and eyes. He saw a lean, well- 
muscled, middle-aged version of 
one well known to him: a certain 
brain-wiped State criminal. 

They’d noticed his tension. They 
turned him over and massaged it 
away. The kneading of muscles 
gradually became eight hands caress- 
ing him . and Corbell was 
seduced twice, to his own amaze- 
ment. He felt that he was falling in 
love with four women: an impossi- 
ble thing for CORBELL Mark I. In 
post-coital sadness Corbell knew at 
last that Corbell was dead . 

He distracted himself with ques- 
tions. 

“No, all nights are not like last 
night,” Charibil told him. “The 
men would tire of us. Last night 
was special. We stayed away from 
this place for five short days. We 



95 




like to give the Boys something to 
watch.” 

“Why?” 

“Why? They rule us, and they 
live forever, but there is one joy 
they can’t know!” she gloated. 

You can live forever! It was on 
the tip of his tongue . but he 
said instead, “What do the men do 
when they’re not up here? I mean, 
if they don’t work — ” 

“They make decisions. And, let 
me see: Privatht is perhaps our 
finest cook. Gording deals with the 
Boys in all matters; in fact he is 
with them now. Charloop makes 
things to teach and entertain 
children — ’ ’ 

“Gording in in the Boy camp?” 

“Yes, he and the Boys had some 
important secret to discuss. They 
wouldn’t — ” 

“I’ve got to be there.” Corbell 
rolled off the bed. “I’m sorry if I’m 
being rude, but this is more impor- 
tant than I can tell you.” He left. 
Behind him he heard tinkling laugh- 
ter. 



m 

It was near sunset. Boys and 
boy-children were roasting a tre- 
mendous fish over coals. Ktollisp 
was telling them a tale. The chil- 
dren were making much of a pair of 
indolent furred snakes. Corbell 
looked for Gording’s white hair. 

He found Gording and Krayhayft 
and Skatholtz a good distance from 
the main group. They were spitting 
Boyish too fast for Corbell’s under- 
standing. He caught the word for 
Girls , and his own word Ganymede. 
And he saw the third cat-tail curled 

96 



in an orange spiral on a rock almost 
behind Skatholtz. 

They saw him. Gording said, 
“Good! Corbell’s sources of knowl- 
edge are different from ours.” 

Krayhayft scoffed. “He did not 
even see the implications.” 

Skatholtz said, “Gording is right. 
Corbell, in one of our tales there is 
a line with no meaing. The tale tells 
of the war between Girls and Boys. 
The line tells that each side de- 
stroyed the other.” 

Corbell sat down cross-legged 
next to Skatholtz. “Could this have 
something to do with our strayed 
planet?” 

“Yes, with the mere fleck of 
light that grows brighter but does 
not move against the background of 
fixed stars. Do you see what that 
might mean?” 

He’d been assuming that that dot 
of light was the banded gas giant 
Peerssa had shown him; but that did- 
n’t have to be true. If it grew 
brighter without moving . grew 
closer, with no shift sideways? 

“It’s coming down our throats!” 

“Well phrased,” said Skatholtz. 

But it was monstrously unfair, 
that Corbell should have found eter- 
nal youth just before the end of the 
world! “You’re guessing,” he said. 

“Of course. But the Girls ruled 
the sky,” Krayhayft said. “When 
the Girls knew they had lost, they 
may have aimed your missing 
Ganymede on a long path to smash 
the world.” 

He couldn’t let this moon thing 
distract him. When his chance came 
he had to be ready. But did it mat- 
ter? If Don Juan had brought him 
back just in time to face this ! 

“Wait. Why not a short path?” 

GALAXY 




Krayhayft shrugged. Skatholtz 
said, “Who can know the mind of a 
Girl? They are long dead.” 

“They were intelligent. The 
longer the path, the more chance 
the moon would miss Earth. It’s 
been — ” Divide by twelve. “ — a 
hundred thousand years, after all.” 
“We do not know how they 
moved worlds. How can we know 
what difficulties they faced? 
Perhaps the long path was their only 
choice.” 

Corbell stood up. He stretched, 
then sat down on the smooth rock 
behind him: a big boulder with a 
cat-tail sleeping on top, well behind 
his head. He braced his feet against 
a smaller, half-buried boulder. 

“I don't like it. I don’t like my 
place in it. Any minor design 
change in Don Juan and I could 
have been back a hundred thousand 
or two hundred thousand years 
sooner. What are the odds I’d get 
here just in time?’ ’ 

Gording laughed at him. “What 
an odd coincidence, that I should be 
alive at this time!” 

“And I!” Skatholtz cried. 

Corbell flushed. “Could the tale 
have meant something else?” 

“Of course,” said Skatholtz. 
“No detail is given.” 

“Okay. The Girls knew they’d 
had it. They were looking for re- 
venge . but in the sky? They 
must have lost control of the sky al- 
ready. Otherwise they’d have put 
the Earth back where it belonged, 
where it wouldn’t get too much 
heat. So they couldn't have thrown 
a moon at Earth, long path or short 
path.” 

“The moon is there,” said 
Krayhayft. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



But Skatholtz said, “Let him 
speak.” 

“Did I tell you what Mirelly- 
Lyra told me? She — ” He tripped 
on the Boyish phrases, then, “She 
left zero-time with a thousand pris- 
oners. Some of them lived to reach 
this place. She says the Boys took 
them, but she escaped.” 

“You’ve lost the thread of 
thought,” Krayhayft reproved him. 

“No, it fits in. Look, if the Girls 
were that close to ruined , there 
wasn’t much they could do. But if 
the Boys were keeping all the dikta 
in the same place, the Girls could 
wipe them out.” 

And as he said it he knew he was 
right. They all saw it . and their 
minds were better than his. Without 
the dikta there would be no more 
Boys. Only a dwindling population 
of immortals dying one by one, by 
accident, boredom, or act of God. 

“Your Mireily-Lyra escaped,” 
said Skatholtz, “because there were 
too few Boys left to hunt her down. 
The new dikta became pampered 
pets, they who had been criminals 
in prehistory.” He barked bitter 
laughter. “But the moon still 
comes. If it is a random result of 
the Girls’ loss of control, still it 
could destroy us. Even a near 
miss — ” His Boyish went into high 
gear . and the others joined 
in . faster and faster . exclud- 
ing Corbell. Suddenly the Boys got 
to their feet and left. 

For an instant Gording let his 
fury show . and then he relaxed. 
And Corbell tested his footing. Butt 
on smooth rock, feet in front of him 
against rock that seemed 
steady . and he dared not look 
behind him. 



97 




“It would not do,” Gording said 
bitterly, “to discuss such important 
matters with a dikt.” 

“What was that about?” 

“They must choose, you see. If 
the moon strikes the world, time 
ends. But if the moon comes by 
mischance, it may still pass close 
by the world. Tides. Earthquakes.” 
“Oh. Dikta City’s right on the 
ocean. They’ll have to move you.” 
“Move us how? Where? They 
can’t let us go free. We are their 
treasure, their source, their valued 
property.” Gording was angry al- 
ready: almost angry enough to strike 
out at the nearest target. 

Now. “Maybe they’ll just take 
some women, the best they can 
find. Mate them with the boy- 
children. There’s no scarcity of 
Boys. They can wait till the stock 
builds up again. After all, they have 
to be fairly careful with their breed- 
ing, considering that their original 
stock was a bunch of rejects 
from — ” 

Unexpectedly soon, unexpectedly 
fast, Gording leapt for his throat. 

Corbell pushed hard against the 
rock, kicked himself out from under 
Gording’ s leap. He reached over his 
head. 

Startled from sleep, the cat-tail 
tried to leap away. Corbell’s hand 
closed on its tail. 

Gording hit ground and came at 
him again, face calm, hands out- 
stretched for murder. He wasn’t 
quick enough. Corbell swung the 
cat-tail into his face. The beast’s 
teeth closed in Gording’s neck. In 
that moment of distraction Corbell 
swung a haymaker at his jaw. 

Gording jerked aside. The cat- tail 
was a tight fur collar, its teeth were 

98 



still in his neck, but he hadn’t been 
distracted for an instant. Hopelessly 
off balance, Corbell watched the old 
man set himself and lash out. 

The hard fist sank into his solar 
plexus. Corbell doubled over. 
Lightning exploded at the nape of 
his neck. 

★ ★ * 

His belly hurt ... his neck 
hurt ... he was curled on his side 
in crushed strawberries. He tried to 
uncurl. 

They were standing around him, 
a lot of Boys looking down. 
Skatholtz was shaking his head and 
smiling. “Magnificent, Corbell!” 

“Then,” said Corbell, “why am I 
lying on the ground hurting? Never 
mind.” He uncurled a little more. 
Gording stood relaxed, his hand 
covering the flesh tom by cat-tail 
teeth. He showed no inclination to 
resume hostilities. 

Corbell said, “I’m sorry. I 
shouldn’t have said that. Maybe it’s 
jealously. You’re all like . 
you’re all smarter than I am, and it 
shows.” 

There was blood beneath the 
hand Gording held to his neck. He 
breathed heavily. He said, “I un- 
derstand. You were careless with an 
unfamiliar language. I should not 
have taken offense. It will be best if 
I rejoin the dikta for tonight.” He 
turned away and took two stumbling 
steps before hands closed on his 
arms. 

Krayhayft was smiling. His hands 
made a wiping motion. “That won’t 
serve. You can’t go back to them, 
Gording. What would they think 
when your hair changed color?’ ’ 

GALAXY 




Cording laughed. “It was worth 
trying.” 

Corbell said, “Shit!” 

“No, no, Corbell, you did a fine 
job of acting. It was the set of your 
muscles that betrayed you ev- 
erywhere. I couldn’t know why you 
wanted me to attack you, and I had 
to find out.” 

“I’m sorry. I couldn’t think of 
any other way. I still don’t 
know ...” 

Krayhayft said, “We’ll know 
soon enough. The logic holds. A 
cat-tail bit you some days before we 
found you. We saw the mark. Our 
tradition is that the dikta may not 
enjoy the company of cat-tails. We 
know that long ago it was possible 
to change the nature of a living 
thing, and we know that it was 
done to cat-tails. Why should they 
not make dikta immortality as Boys 
make spit? But we’ll watch you as 
we go, Gording, to see if you grow 
young. 

“And as we go, Corbell, we will 
think of some useful punishment for 
your deception. Already I have an 
idea. 

“And we go now." 

IV 

By dead of night the tribe moved 
along the shore. They carried 
neither food nor water. Jupiter 
showed a bright gibbous disk above 
the dark sea. The mystery planet 
showed too, near Jupiter. Corbell 
picked out other moons, and a 
moon-shadow on Jupiter’s banded 
face. 

One of the children had gone to 
sleep and was being carried. The 
others asked a thousand questions of 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



laughing Boys. Corbell listened to 
the answers. Details of the march 
ahead . other bands of Boys 
. wondrous machines . the 
gathering in Sarash-Zillish 
. .nothing he hadn’t heard or 
guessed. 

He waited his chance to talk to 
Gording alone. It never came. 
Gording marched at the head of the 
line, under escort. When Corbell 
tried to catch up he was barred with 
spear butts. 

By morning they were thirsty. 

By noon they were very thirsty, 
and loud were the complaints of the 
boy-children. Gording was showing 
the strain of unaccustomed hiking, 
but he showed it silently, in the 
slight weave to his walk and the oc- 
casional stumble. 

In the afternoon they reached a 
river. The splashing was loud as 
Boys and boys drank and then 
swam. Here they camped. Corbell 
and others caught fish with 
makeshift hooks and lines of thread 
that might have come from Dikta 
City. Corbell was not allowed to 
clean his fish; he was not allowed a 
knife. 

And this was the thread that 
would make wonderful strangler’s 
cord, if it didn’t cut the strangler’s 
fingers ... but as he considered his 
fishline he caught Krayhayft grin- 
ning at him. Krayhayft held out his 
hand. Corbell put the fishline in it. 

The river had cut a deep gorge 
into the former sea bottom, leaving 
high, sheer cliffs of layered 
sandstone. All day they followed 
the twisting, beautifully colored 
walls. At sunset, where the cliffs 
constricted and took a sharp tum, 
they came on a hidden village. The 

99 




village occupied both sides of the 
river, joined by a wide bridge. Be- 
yond the village the desolation con- 
tinued to the horizon. 

The villagers made them wel- 
come and fed them. Corbell enter- 
tained with a medley of advertising 
jingles. Afterward Krayhayft began 
a tale while Corbell made himself 
comfortable against a convenient 
boulder. 

It seemed to him that the village 
was a well-placed trap. 

If dikta followed a band of Boys 
from Dikta City, they would have 
to go around the village, climbing 
cliffs to do it and leaving traces of 
themselves, and into more desola- 
tion. Unless they wanted to risk 
raiding the village . 

There was a “phone booth” at 
one end of the bridge. The bridge 
was a wide arch of prestressed con- 
crete or something better, its lines 
singularly beautiful. And these were 
the only signs of advanced technol- 
ogy among basic and primitive 
structures. 

There had been bread and com 
with tonight’s fish. There must be a 
working “phone booth” here to 
bring them. But was that it ? It was 
too blatant. It might be a trap. 

A voice behind Corbell’ s ear 
whispered, “We will not let you 
use the Prilatsil. ’ ’ 

Corbell turned to stare rudely at 
the intruder. He had not been 
watching the booth. 

The Boy was of the village: a 
pink-eyed, golden-haired albino 
with a narrow ferret face. He almost 
lost his footing as he squatted next 
to Corbell. His loincloth was animal 
skin. 

He was young, then. Corbell had 
100 



learned to tell. The older Boys were 
never awkward, and they did not 
brag of their kills by wearing the 
skins. He grinned and said, “Try it 
if you like. We would bruise you.” 

“I think they’ll bruise me any- 
way,” Corbell said. He’d been 
wondering about Krayhayft’s 
“punishment.” Damn Krayhayft. 
Corbell would be a bag of nerve- 
ends before the blade fell. 

“Yes. You lied,” said the golden 
Boy. “I am to be there when 
punishment comes.” 

“Sadist,” Corbell said in En- 
glish. 

“I can guess the meaning. No. 
We do not make pain for pleasure, 
only for instruction. Your pain will 
be instructive to you and to us.” 
The Boy chuckled gloatingly, mak- 
ing a liar of himself, and got up. 

Now, what was that all about? 
Corbell expected to die as soon as 
Gording began to grow young. He 
knew too much. Or would they only 
wipe his memory? He shivered. It 
would still be death, though it 
would let them use the ancient fe- 
lon’s genes. 

♦ ★ * 

They left carrying provisions. 
One of the boy-children stayed be- 
hind. Half a dozen villagers came 
with them, including the young al- 
bino. 

The continental shelf had been 
wider in this area. It was still bar- 
ren. The day was nearly over before 
they reached, first fruit trees, then 
cornfields. They camped in the 
com. 

They passed a larger tribe on the 
third day. For a time the two tribes 

GALAXY 




intermingled, exchanging news. 
Then the larger group veered away, 
taking two of Krayhayft’s tribe and 
two boy-children. 

They passed single human beings 
at a distance. “Loners,” Skatholtz 
told him. “They tire of others 
around them. For a time they go 
alone to know if they still love 
themselves. Krayhayft has done it 
six times.” 

Through waist-high corn they 
marched. In early afternoon a herd 
of dwarf buffalo passed, tens of 
thousands of them, blackening the 
land and raising continuous rolling 
thunder. The trampled path was a 
quarter hour’s march across: com 
churned into the dirt, and the corp- 
ses of aged buffalo unable to keep 
up. For the first time Corbell saw 
vultures. Vultures had survived un- 
changed. 

Skatholtz bent their path to take 
them through a ruined city. An earth- 
quake, or Girl weaponry, had 
shattered most of the buildings, and 
time had weathered all the sharp 
edges. Corbell saw sand-blasted 
public “phone booths”; he ignored 
them. He’d seen no evidence that 
power was still coming to this ruin. 

Boys had made a semipermanent 
camp at the far edge of the ruined 
city. Krayhayft’s tribe joined them, 
and contributed ears of com to their 
dinner. Corbell saw what they were 
using for cooking. 

What the locals had mounted on 
rocks above their fireplace was a 
piece of clear glass seven feet 
across, curved like an enormous 
wok: a good enough frying pan ex- 
cept for the- dangerous jagged 
edges. It had to be a piece of 
bubble-car. 

THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE 



+ + ★ 

On the fourth day they passed 
two tribes, and joined with them for 
a time, and left them behind. With 
the other tribe went the last two 
boy-children. Corbell couldn’t help 
wondering if that related to his situ- 
ation. There are things you don’t do 
in front of children. 

Gording was having less trouble 
keeping up. If the chance came, the 
old man would be able to 
run ... but running wouldn’t do it. 
The Boys were faster. Corbell 
wanted transportation. 

“Phone booths” didn’t send far 
enough. Useful for hiding, but not 
for reaching safety. A car would be 
better. Or . what did the Boys 
use to lower a dozen bedrooms onto 
the roof of Dikta City? A giant 
helicopter? Some big flying thing, 
anyway. 

He wouldn’t find any of these 
things outside a city, Corbell 
thought. Maybe they existed in 
Sarash-Zillish alone. He would 
reach Sarash-Zillish too late; Gord- 
ing’s hair would be showing black 
by then. 

Corbell tried to listen to what the 
Boys were telling the loner about 
Corbell. Unfamiliar words, and the 
drumming of the afternoon rain, 
made that impossible. But the wan- 
derer derived much amusement 
from what he was hearing. 

When the afternoon rain ended, it 
revealed reaching towers whose tops 
sketched a dome-shape. 

They camped a mere hour’s dis- 
tance from what seemed an intact 
city. Corbell slept badly that night. 
If he could break loose, to reach the 

101 




city alone . But every time he 
looked around him someone was 
watching him. As if they could read 
his mind . 

V 

Parhalding was bigger than 
Sarash-Zillish. Mud and rust had 
done their work . and invading 
soil and grass and trees and vines. 
The buildings still stood, most of 
them. Their flat roofs sprouted 
green heads. Grapevines and 
blackberry vines swathed their 
waists. Com and wheat grew mixed 
where soil was shallow. Where soil 
and water could pool, there were 
gnarled old trees bearing varied fruit 
and walnuts. 

Corbell picked what looked like a 
puffy lemon. (The limbs of the tree 
were thick and low ... its green 
head touched vines swarming to the 
second story of a building with 
empty windows . but Boys 
climbed like monkeys, and they 
were too close, and watching.) The 
fruit tasted like lemonade, like 
lemon with sugar. 

Parhalding was what an aban- 
doned city looked like. In Sarash- 
Zillish he had taken the state of pre- 
servation for granted. Foolish. He 
should have been looking for 
caretakers. 

The vines bulged oddly, there 
near the corner, and something 
glinted within the bulge. Light 
shifted as he walked . and Cor- 
bell became certain that there was a 
bubble-car under the bulge. How 
badly damaged? Corbell caught 
Gording’s fraction-of-a-glance. Had 
anyone else caught it? The Boys 
couldn’t know everything . 

102 



. But the tribe had clumped 
inward as they walked. He might 
have thought they were afraid of 
ancient ghosts. But they had con- 
verged to a compact mass with 
Cottrell in the middle, and it was 
Corbell who was afraid. 

That building ahead: no vines, no 
green top. Someone had maintained 
it. Corbell knew it by its shape: a 
hospital. 

The hospital’s big double doors 
opened for them. Now the dozen 
Boys around Corbell were close 
enough to trip over one another, 
though they didn’t. Indirect lighting 
came alive slowly, showing an ad- 
missions desk, a shattered picture 
window with a few glass teeth still 
in it, cloud-rug and sofas cleaned of 
glass; and a wall covered by a dou- 
ble polar projection map with the 
polar caps prominent. 

The last Boy through the door 
fell to his knees. His head was 
gone. His neck jetted bright blood. 

Gording was at bay. The young 
albino was between him and the 
double doors. As the albino came at 
him Gording threw a rock, side arm, 
to miss. Corbell tried to make sense 
of what he was seeing. The rock 
passed behind the albino’s neck, 
turned sharply and circled his 
throat. Gording jerked hard on the 
other rock still in his hand. 

Then it made sense. The albino 
screamed without sound and clawed 
at the air between them. His neck 
parted cleanly. The doors opened 
for the headless corpse as it stum- 
bled backward. Gording brushed 
past it and was gone.

It is not his technology — 
that is merely a tool — that 
makes Man a deadly adver- 
sary, but his mind. .and spirit. 



I. 

The practice yard fell silent. 
Sensing a presence behind him, 
Jerome lowered his sword, and 
turned slowly to face Father 
Ribaud, the Sword Master. Behind 
him, standing nervously at the edge 
of the yard, was a young Messenger 
dressed in the black robe of one 
who served the Grandfathers. 

A thrill of anticipation ran shiver- 
ing up Jerome’s spine. A Message 
from the Grandfather! Perhaps his 
request for Audience was being an- 
swered! 

Ribaud nodded somberly. “Yes, 
it’s for you. From the Grand- 
father.” 

Jerome nodded slowly, trying to 
read the old man’s face for informa- 
tion. “Did he say what it’s about?” 

The Sword Master suppressed a 
look of amusement. “The simple 
way to find out is to go over and 
ask the lad. He’s the Messenger, 
you know, not I. And from the 

104 



looks of him, he’d be only too glad 
to deliver his message and be off. ’ ’ 
Ribaud nodded towards the Mes- 
senger, who was anxiously shifting 
from foot to foot. “He’s nervous as 
a cat what with all the Mushin float- 
ing around this yard. His mind isn’t 
trained to handle it yet.” He turned 
to the silently standing students. 
“Which reminds me that no one 
told the rest of you to stop training 
and gawk around like a bunch of 
Novices. Back to work, the lot of 
you. Start off with five hundred 
each, head, chest, and wrist cuts, 
slowly. Control your breath and 
calm your mind.” 

Practice began again, each stu- 
dent reciting the Chant of Calmness 
as he swung his sword in unison 
with the others. Ribaud watched for 
a moment, then motioned to 
Jerome and walked with him over 
to where the Messenger stood wait- 
ing. 

“Messenger — Brother Jerome,” 
Ribaud said, and stepped back out 
of easy earshot, though Jerome 
knew he would hear every word. 
He might be old, but Ribaud was 
still in possession of all his facul- 
ties, including an incredible, cat- 
like swiftness. 

The Messenger licked the sweat 
from his upper lip and focused dis- 
tressed eyes on Jerome. “Brother 
Jerome,” he began, his voice crack- 
ing a little. “Grandfather bids me 
call you to his presence. Father 
Ribaud is to prepare you for Audi- 
ence. Come as soon as you are 

GALAXY 



ready. I . .1 . uh . that is 
all.” Abruptly the black-clad youth 
turned and fled the practice yanl. 

A sardonic grin on his face, 
Ribaud sauntered over to where 
Jerome stood gazing after the re- 
treating Messenger. “So. Audience 
it is. Face to face with the Grand- 
father. And I’m to prepare you. No 
easy task, that.” The Sword Master 
sighed. His tone had been bantering, 
but his concern was obvious. 

While Jerome racked his practice 
sword and changed from padded 
practice robe to a regular one, 
Ribaud carefully outlined the proper 
procedure for Personal Audience 
with die Grandfather. From time to 
time the young man would nod or 
grunt, but otherwise gave no indica- 
tion he was listening. Ribaud knew 
otherwise. Nothing really passed 
Jerome by. He was incredibly quick 
and bright. 

Even while talking, the old man’s 
mind went back, back some fifteen 
years to the day he had found 
Jerome. The lad had been sitting 
amid the smoking ruins of the 
farmstead at Waters Meeting, trying 
to straighten his dead mother’s cloth- 
ing. Ribaud knew the child had 
witnessed his father’s torture, his 
mother’s rape, and the slaughter of 
both at the hands of the Ronin who 
had raided the farm. 

It still seemed like a miracle that 
the boy had escaped the Madness. 
Those few who survived the Ronin 
were always mad. Death was usu- 
ally a kindness. Yet that small boy 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



had not only survived, but had 
somehow retained his sanity. Oh, 
true, true, rage and madness lurked 
deep in his eyes. Yet it was not the 
Madness. It was something deep 
within him, shackled and hidden 
away in the dark place at the center 
of his being, not something brought 
on by the Mu shin. It was a madness 
and rage he owned and controlled 
so well even the Mushin could not 
sniff it out. 

The routine details out of the 
way, Ribaud pondered what else he 
ought say. He knew he should give 
the lad some sort of advice, for Au- 
dience was not without its peril. 
Men had been known to break in 
the presence of the Grandfather. 
And the Mushin hovered constantly, 
waiting for just such a break to 
swoop down and bring the Mad- 
ness. 

Not that Ribaud was really wor- 
ried about Jerome. The lad Control- 
led his mind very well. Perhaps bet- 
ter than any other Son in the 
Brotherhood. At times he felt the 
young man’s control was a little too 
rigid, too brittle, but there was no 
question it was effective. Still in 
all, the Sword Master felt a vague, 
gnawing worry over the idea of 
Jerome facing the Grandfather, He 
must do the best he could by the 
lad. 

“Now, my Son, listen as you’ve 
never listened before.” Jerome 
looked up, surprised by the Sword 
Master’s sudden urgency. 

“You go to face the Grandfather, 

105 




not some Brother, or even a Father. 
The Grandfather. Remember: no 
matter how benevolent his rule, 
he is alien. Never, never think 
you can deal with him as you would 
with another human.” 

The Sword Master paused for a 
moment to gather his thoughts and 
then continued. ‘‘I know you’ve 
heard the story a thousand times, 
but hear it again, so that it will be 
foremost in your awareness during 
your Audience. 

★ ★ ★ 

“Mankind came to Kensho on 
the Arks,” Ribaud began. “Like all 
the Great Pilgrimages that left the 
Mother World to spread our kind 
throughout the Galaxy, the Col- 
onists were a polyglot group rep- 
resenting the myriad ways of thought 
and life found on Earth. The leader 
of this group was Admiral Nakam- 
ura, a High Master of the Universal 
Way of Zen. 

“When the Admiral found this 
planet there was great rejoicing. It 
was beautiful. An Eden. Three 
probe surveys showed a virgin 
planet with no sign of higher life, 
no mark of civilization, nothing but 
a primeval wilderness so enthralling 
that Nakamura named it “Kensho,” 
after the first stage of Enlighten- 
ment. 

“Then the Colonists were landed 
at First Touch — and all hell broke 
loose. Everyone went mad, tearing 
at each other, murdering, maiming. 

106 



Like vicious, wild animals. It was 
the Madness. It blew the Colony 
apart and scattered the raving, kill- 
ing debris across the landscape. 

“For most of the Colonists, there 
was no way to fight back. They 
didn’t even know what caused the 
Madness. All they knew was that 
any emotion, especially a strong 
one like fear or anger, would grow 
and grow until it overflowed the 
mind and drove it into raving Mad- 
ness. 

“Imagine what it must have been 
like! Anything could set it off. The 
man sitting next to you at dinner 
might accidently bump you with his 
elbow. If the sudden flash of an- 
noyance you felt wasn’t instantly 
brought under control, it would 
grow and grow uncontrollably until 
it became a towering, unreasoning, 
murderous rage. 

“Now we know it was the 
Mushin. We know they feed on our 
emotions. They use some kind of 
feedback technique to make the 
emotions stronger and stronger in an 
ever increasing spiral so that there 
is more emotive energy, more food 
for their insatiable appetites. 

“The Mushin brought the Mad- 
ness down, drove Mankind insane, 
and very nearly wiped us out on 
Kensho. 

“But not quite, not quite. A few 
resisted. Admiral Nakmura, along 
with some other members of the 
crew who were adepts of the Way 
of Zen, held out against the 
onslaught of the Mushin. Together 

GALAXY 




they formed a small core of calm- 
ness which managed to envelope 
and save many of the saner and 
subdue numbers of the insane. The 
leaders of the group began to make 
plans for the evacuation of the sur- 
vivors. 

“Before the plan could be com- 
pleted, Admiral Nakamura disap- 
peared. For several days the others 
toiled to hold the little group of 
survivors together, but without 
Nakamura’s leadership they began 
to lose ground. Evacuation was out 
of the question. Even survival 
looked doubtful. 

“Then the Grandfathers ap- 
peared. From somewhere. From 
nowhere. We don’t know. But they 
came. And they brought the Way of 
Passivity. They said the Way had 
come from the mind of Admiral 
Nakamura whom they had found 
dying from an accident. They said 
they had taken his profound knowl- 
edge of the Way of Zen and tailored 
it to meet Mankind’s needs here on 
Kensho, and that we had to accept 
it if we were to fend off the Mushin 
and survive. That we must learn to 
control our minds and emotions 
through spiritual exercises and phys- 
ical disciplines: only with the Way 
of Passivity would life on Kensho 
be possible. 

“With a little training in its 
techniques a small group, say a 
family, might live in harmony on an 
isolated farmstead. With more train- 
ing as many as seventy might dwell 
together as we do here at the Broth- 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



erhood. True, in either place the 
Mushin hover invisibly, ready in an 
instant to swoop down and feed, but 
the Passivity is our shield and keeps 
them from finding a target and 
bringing down the Madness. 

“We owe our very existence to 
the Grandfathers, Jerome. They 
have become our benefactors, our 
leaders. We cannot question the 
rightness of their actions or their 
decisions. 

“Yet .now, against all advice, 
you go to ask the Grandfather to 
allow you to leave the Brotherhood 
to follow the Way of the Sword. 
Even though you know the Sword is 
nothing but a way-station, a training 
device to prepare you to follow the 
Way of Passivity, the Ultimate Path 
given by the Grandfathers for all 
men to follow here on Kensho. You 
say it is not enough, that there must 
be more. By so doing you challenge 
not only the authority of the Grand- 
fathers, but the experience of seven 
generations of Mankind on Kensho. 

“I know, Father, I know,’’ 
Jerome interrupted so gently that it 
almost seemed like a continuation 
of the older man’s monologue. “I 
don’t question that the Way of Pas- 
sivity was probably the best defense 
we could organize at the time. 
We’re indebted to the Grandfathers 
for showing us the Way. “But is de- 
fense enough? For seven genera- 
tions we’ve defended ourselves. 
We’ve never struck back. How can 
we? We don’t know anything about 
the enemy. Only what the Grand- 

107 




fathers tell us, which is virtually 
nothing. 

“What has passivity gained us? 
A degree of safety and peace. Or 
better yet, safety and stagnation.” 
The older man opened his mouth to 
object, but Jerome hurried on. 
“Yes, stagnation! Look, Father, 
how many new Brotherhoods have 
been built in your lifetime? How 
many new farmsteads have been 
founded? None! Not one. In fact, 
some, like ours at Waters Meeting, 
aren’t even occupied any longer.” 
A look of remembered pain flicked 
momentarily in the black depths of 
Jerome’s eyes like the barely visible 
tail of a fish at the bottom of a 
pond. Just the barest movement. 
Then it was gone, instantly slam- 
med behind the iron wall of his con- 
trol. 

“It’s as if . .as if . .” For a 
moment the young man groped for 
an idea just at the edge of under- 
standing. Finding it, he rushed in 
pursuit. “Yes! It’s as if we’ve 
reached some optimum level, some 
point the Grandfathers don’t want 
us to pass. We’re like cattle, pen- 
ned up in the Brotherhoods or on 
the farmsteads, completely domesti- 
cated and unable to roam the surface 
of the planet we came to colonize; 
unable to grow. Instead, we’re kept 
safe and stagnant, cowering under 
the watchful eyes of the Grand- 
fathers, controlled by the Way of 
Passivity, defending ourselves 
against an enemy we can’t see and 
don’t understand. 

108 



“Father, when the path you’re on 
leads nowhere, you must seek a 
new path. The Way of Passivity 
gives us survival — but it leads 
nowhere. We must find a new way, 
a way to fight back, to strike out at 
the things which keep us hiding like 
frightened cattle in the safe little 
pens the Grandfathers have built for 
us. 

“I don’t know the answer. I 
don’t know what the path should 
be. But I feel the Way of the Sword 
may have something to offer, some- 
thing the Way of Passivity is lack- 
ing. I don’t know. Unless I have a 
chance to follow the Way of the 
Sword, I never will know. All I ask 
is that chance.” 

Ribaud shook his head with 
weary sadness. “Jerome, my Son, 
at times wanting must give way to 
acceptance.” Jerome made to reply 
but the Sword Master held up his 
hand. “The Way of the Sword, fol- 
lowed to the end, leads to the Mad- 
ness. Look at the Ronin, boy, look 
at the mad animals that slaughtered 
your family. Didn’t they carry 
Swords? 

“Jerome, the Grandfathers are 
right, even though you are too 
young to see it. All young men 
have strong emotions. And you 
have reasons to harbor the strongest 
of all: hate. You control it well; in- 
deed, far beyond what one has a 
right to expect in one so young. But 
you have boundless energy and 
boundless ambition. The Broth- 
erhood is hard on you. It is a kinder 

GALAXY 




life for softer men. But there is no 
other way for humanity here on 
Kensho. The Madness lies in wait 
on any other path.” 

Even as he uttered the words, 
Ribaud felt their utter futility. The 
lad would not listen, indeed could 
not listen without doing violence to 
his .own character. And the Grand- 
father would never allow him to 
leave the Brotherhood to follow the 
Way of the Sword. Even though 
there was truth to what Jerome said, 
the results of the coming Audience 
could only be tragic. 

Jerome looked down and dug at 
the dust with his toes. ‘‘I know,” 
he began in a normal voice. Then, 
dropping to a hoarse whisper he 
continued, ‘‘But it means so much 
to me, Father, so much.” 

The Sword Master suddenly 
realized that he was beyond his 
depth, that he was now treading into 
the dark recesses of Jerome’s desire 
and need. 

Dangerous, he thought, to stir 
up such ghosts and specters in one 
who goes to Audience. 

Ribaud shook his head. It was 
time to stop, to calm, to support, to 
say somthing, anything, that might 
help. So little I can do, he fretted, 
so little I can say that has any 
meaning. He felt the leaden weight 
of his inability to offer anything but 
platitudes. In truth he knew nothing 
of this complex creature that stood 
before him. Nothing but the sur- 
face. All he could do was to speak 
to that surface. 



Ribaud shook his head in defeat. 
“Go,” he quietly commanded 
Jerome. “Go to the Grandfather and 
listen to what he doesn’t say as 
carefully as to what he says. He 
may speak in what sounds to you 
like riddles. He may not speak at 
all. If the first, look for meaning 
beyond words. If the second, listen 
to the eloquence of the silence. I 
can offer nothing more.” 

Bowing low, Jerome turned and 
began walking in the direction of 
the Grandfather’s cell. 



II. 

In each of the Brotherhoods, at 
its very center, stands a small, win- 
dowless building. There is a single, 
low door in it, facing south. The 
door is always crudely made of 
planks from a Ko tree. Inside, the 
single room is bare except for a 
mat, woven from the bark of the 
same tree, rectangular, beginning at 
the back wall of the room and end- 
ing just short of the door. Sitting on 
the mat, a little over half way to the 
wall is the Grandfather. 

Once a Grandfather gathers a 
group of men together and forms a 
Brotherhood, once the cell has been 
built, the alien stays there, sitting. 
He never leaves the cell, never even 
moves, as far as anyone can tell. 
Occasionally the creature says 
something in his high, whispery 
voice. One of his black-clad Mes- 
sengers then hastens to do his bid- 
ding. 



SEEKER OF THE WAY 



109 




Yet somehow the Grandfather is 
the heart and soul of a Brotherhood. 
Ail important decisions are referred 
to him, even though he often fails 
to reply to a question and as often 
as not when he does reply, his ut- 
terances are unintelligible. 
Nevertheless, each is carefully taken 
down and religiously studied by the 
Fathers until it inspires a decision. 

On the north, east, and west of 
the alien Grandfather’s cell are the 
long, low buildings which house the 
human Fathers. To the south lies 
the Meditation Hall, a roof sup- 
ported by pillars. Beyond the 
Father’s quarters are the Workshops 
and the Rooms of Learning. Further 
yet toward the wails are the practice 
yards for the Way of the Sword, the 
Way of the Fist, and the Way of the 
Staff. Below the Sitting Hall, to the 
south, is the practice yard for the 
Soft Way, Beyond that squats the 
low form of the Refectory with its 
long tables and hot, steamy kitch- 
ens. Built into the walls which en- 
close the Brotherhood are stables 
and pens for the animals and the 
tiny cells where the Novices and 
Sons dwell. A tidy community of 
seventy humans and one alien. 

As Jerome approached the Grand- 
father’s cell, he tried to picture the 
alien. He had seen him only once, 
the day he had been dedicated to 
the Brotherhood as a Novice. As an 
orphan, he had been required to 
present himself to the Grandfather 
for approval. He could remember 
little but the creature’s huge, glow- 

110 



ing, multifaceted eyes. The rest was 
mainly a memory of shadow, vague 
bulk, and an occasional sharp angle. 
By rumor, of course, he knew a 
great deal more. The angles had 
been the alien’s stick-like arms and 
legs: the legs folded in front; the 
arms, elbows out, resting on the 
knees. Bulk was the large barrel 
chest, covered with a hard, chitin- 
ous substance rather like the armour 
they sometimes wore during sword 
practice. The head was long and 
narrow, domed at top and coming 
to a point at the bottom. Large eyes 
bisected it. Overall, the effect was 
of a large, benevolent cockroach: 
a cockroach that talked, and 
thought, and meditated, and ruled a 
community of seventy humans, but 
never, never left his cell. 

A Messenger, probably the same 
one, stood by the door, his face 
averted in respect. As Jerome ap- 
proached, the lad pulled back the 
door, letting a splash of light drop 
into the darkness of the room. 
Stooping, Jerome entered. The door 
swung shut and night fell. 

For a few moments he stood still, 
his back to the door. Silently he re- 
peated the Litany of Passivity to 
calm his thumping heart. “Moons, 
moons, shining down on waters, 
waters, moving slowly, moons mov- 
ing slowly, yet being still. Still the 
waters, still the moons. Movement, 
strife, all longing is but a reflection, 
passing to stillness when the mind 
is calmed.” He droned through it 
three times while his eyes adjusted 

GALAXY 




to the dark and he gained enough 
presence of mind to sit down on his 
end of the Ko mat. 

He sat, legs crossed, hands on his 
knees, eyes cast down about five 
feet in front of himself, seeing-but- 
not-seeing. He regulated his breath. 
And waited. 

And waited. 

And waited. 

An incalculable age later there 
came a rising whisper, a breeze of 
meaning that gently blew toward 
him across the dark, “why this sub- 
section of unity now in this place, 
interrogation.” 

Jerome, lulled by the long wait, 
snapped his mind back into focus. 
“This subsection of unity has a re- 
quest,” he whispered back. 

‘‘Make request apparent to this 
vessel of totality,” came the softly 
hissing answer. 

“This subsection of unity wishes 
to go to the Old Master on the 
Mountain to follow the Way of the 
Sword.” 

Emotion surged up, threatening to 
overwhelm the controls Jerome, had 
spent so many years constructing. 
The Sword! How much it meant to 
him! As a child he had never even 
thought of the Sword, never even 
seen one, for that matter. He was a 
farmer’s son, wed to the land. 

But then the Sword had come 
unbidden into his life, shattering 
and smashing it into dead, lifeless, 
bloodsoaked fragments. The Sword 
of Death, brought by the three Ro- 
nin, flashing up, flashing down, 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



cutting, gutting. Three Ronin, men 
who did not fear the Madness, but 
who actively sought it out, who in- 
vited the Mushin to take over their 
minds, who reveled in rapine, 
slaughter, insanity. Three Ronin, 
three Swords, slashing his life to 
ribbons, bringing death, death, death. 

What demons the Sword had 
raised only the Sword could lay to 
rest. Only the Sword of Life could 
give back what the Sword of Death 
had taken. The Sword giveth and 
the Sword taketh away. So be it. 
Even at seven years of age he had 
realized that. He had known it 
deeply, organically, without logic, 
without words, without even 
thought. Only by mastering what 
had destroyed his life could he hope 
to recreate his life. The Sword had 
started him on this road. Only by 
the Sword could he reach his des- 
tined end. And somewhere, some- 
way, he would meet the Three and 
complete the cycle of Death and 
Life, Life and Death. 

When he had come to the Broth- 
erhood, he had thrown himself into 
his studies with an intensity that had 
worried the Fathers. In exhaustion 
he had found release from the de- 
monic visions and memories which 
constantly lurked in the shadows at 
the edge of his conscious mind. In 
the Spiritual Exercises and the Phys- 
ical Disciplines he had found a way 
to build an iron wall of control 
around the turbulent passions and 
fears that dwelt in the dark center of 
his being. 



Ill 




Relentlessly he had worked and 
prepared until as a Sixth Level Son 
he had been allowed to ehter the 
Way of the Sword with Father 
Ribaud. Once on the Way, he had 
redoubled his efforts. With cold 
fury he practiced each cut, each 
block, each move, each form until 
exhaustion felled him. After a short 
rest, he came back for more. In five 
years he had learned everything 
Father Ribaud had to teach. 
Jerome’s technique was flawless, 
his form polished like glass wood. A 
perfect machine, all he lacked was 
the soul, the True Understanding of 
the Way of the Sword as opposed to 
the Technique of the Sword. Ribaud 
had tried to show Jerome the Way. 
But Ribaud himself was only the 
Sword Master at an out-of-the-way 
Brotherhood. He was not a True 
Master of the Way, not an En- 
lightened One. He could point out 
the Path, but had never trodden it 
himself. He could not lead Jerome 
on the Way. He could only indicate 
the general direction in which it lay. 
Ribaud knew his limitations and 
made no bones about it. Jerome 
knew too, and also knew that there 
could be no further progress toward 
his goal unless he found a True 
Master to study with. 

There was such a Master on the 
Mountain. Known only as the Old 
Master, he lived in a tiny hut, far 
up the slopes of the towering Moun- 
tain. Years ago, when the Old Mas- 
ter had first appeared in the region, 
he had singlehandedly wiped out a 

112 



band of eight Ronin which the 
Brotherhood had been unable to kill 
or drive away. Then he settled on 
the slopes of the Mountain. At first, 
he had grudgingly accepted a few 
students from the Brotherhood. As a 
Fifth Level Son, the young Ribaud 
had been among them. On the 
Mountain he had caught just a 
glimpse of the Real Way, a single 
Satori experience. He still spoke of 
the experience with reverence and 
awe. 

Then the Grandfather had handed 
down a decision. It was very clear, 
very precise. No one was to go 
study the Way of the Sword with 
the Old Master on the Mountain. 
The Way of the Sword was too ac- 
tive, too dangerous to Passivity. It 
was a training vehicle, a way- 
station on the path to Passivity and 
a technique to fend off the Ronin. 
Nothing more. 

That was thirty years ago. Since 
then hardly anyone had seen the 
Old Master, though from time to 
time the Brotherhood’s patrols had 
found the bodies of groups of Ro- 
nin, so it was assumed the old man 
was still alive. Yet the fact re- 
mained that for thirty years no one 
has gone to study the Way of the 
Sword with the Old Master. 

But Jerome knew he had to try. It 
was the only way, his only hope! 
The Grandfather must allow him to 
go, must not stand in the way of his 
destiny! 

But calm! He must remain calm! 
To draw down Mushin in the Very 

GALAXY 




presence of the Grandfather! Even a 
Novice wouldn’t do anything so 
foolish, so indicative of a lack of 
control and a straying from the Way 
of Passivity. “Moons, moons, shin- 
ing down . he chanted silently, 
forcing down the emotions, the 
hopes, forcing his entire being back 
down, down, into a tiny, window- 
less cell at the center of his soul. 

Silence. 

And waiting. 

Then, eventually, the darkness 
began to vibrate again. Muffled 
meaning softly filtered through the 
black of the cell to his straining 
ears. It was a chant. One he had 
never heard before: 

The Sword is the Mind. 

When the Mind is right, the 
Sword is right. 

When the Mind is not right, the 
Sword is not right. 

He who would study the Way of 
the Sword must first study 
his Mind. 

Again and again the Grandfather re- 
peated the chant, his hissing rising 
and falling. At times his voice 
seemed to fill the cell, pushing back 
the darkness. At other times it 
shrank to a tiny spark almost over- 
whelmed by the endless night 
around them. The chant wound its 
way into Jerome’s mind, down into 
his soul, curling, twisting like a tiny 
snake of smoke coming from a fire 
one had thought was extinguished. 
Slowly it filled his whole being, 
until it seemed there was no more 
room for him inside himself. 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



Control! Control! He had to re- 
gain control! Raised from childhood 
to fear the Mushin, Jerome was ter- 
rified at the very thought of anyone 
or anything tampering with the care- 
fully constructed fabric of his mind 
control. For generations, loss of 
control had meant the Mushin gained 
control, bringing the Madness that 
had so nearly destroyed the human 
race on Kensho. 

Now Jerome fought back desper- 
ately, instinctively. He closed down 
his mind. Slowly, agonizingly 
slowly, he retreated back into the 
hard, dark core of his being. He 
shut out the curling chant with its 
meaning beyond words, he fought 
to reintegrate himself as a separate 
entity, to cut himself off from ex- 
ternal influence. 

Panting, sweating harder than 
he ever had in the practice yard, 
Jerome gradually brought himself 
under control again. Deep within 
him a huge rage burned, shielded 
from the Mushin by the black walls 
of his being. But it burned fiercely 
all the same. 

The Grandfather! The alien had 
done this to him! Had tried to take 
over his mind! The Grandfather 
could do things to his mind! It 
could do things like the Mushin 
could do! 

Anger, confusion, rage, fear, all 
contained, all held deep within, 
fused together in a sudden intuitive 
leap. The Grandfather and the 
Mushin! Somehow they were 
linked, related! The benefactor of 

113 




the race and its worst enemy were 
somehow tied together! 

Revulsion and disgust rose up 
and twisted into hatred, joining the 
other emotions that raged within 
him. For an instant blind fury and 
hate spewed across Jerome’s mind 
like a leaping wall of brilliant 
flame. The explosion was incredi- 
ble. In one motion he stood and 
took a single step toward the Grand- 
father. Almost swifter than thought 
his hand rose and fell in a swift arc, 
striking at the base of the alien’s 
neck. 

With a sharp snap the head flew 
off and smashed against the wall of 
(he cell. 

The entire universe stood still. 
Frozen, his mouth agape, > Jerome 
stood, looking at the crumpled, 
broken head that lay at the base of 
the wall. His emotions, his incredi- 
ble raging fury, were gone, sucked 
into the cold void of eternity. 

Then, in the next instant, the fro- 
zen, fragile universe shattered like 
thin crystal and crashed down upon 
his head. His mind a blank, Jerome 
tottered and crumpled to the floor. 

m. 

Consciousness returned slowly, 
like an old man dragging himself up 
a steep flight of stairs. For a while 
Jerome simply lay there, enjoying 
the solidity of the floor and the tex- 
ture of the Ko mat against his 
cheek. Then memory began to seep 
through the hazy curtains of his 
confusion. His hand crept softly 
114 



across his face to brush away the 
last fogginess and his eyes opened. 

Jerome sat up and looked at the 
Grandfather. The alien’s body still 
sat at the other end of the Ko mat. 
Over by the wall lay its shattered 
head. • 

Memory changed from a seeping 
to a sweeping flood. Jerome braced 
himself against it and the first wave 
broke harmlessly against the walls 
of his control. Gradually he allowed 
memory to percolate down through 
the layers of his mind. As it sank to 
the core of his being a thought rose 
to meet and pass it by on the way 
to consciousness. “I have killed a 
Grandfather,” he whispered. ‘‘I 
have killed a Grandfather. ” 

Hearing the sound of his own voice 
gave the thought a solidity that 
made it possible for him to grasp and 
work with it. Carefully he wove it 
into the framework of thought through 
which he interpreted the world. 

The Way of Passivity taught that 
Being caused Desiring. Desiring 
gave rise to Action. Inevitably, Ac- 
tion led to Frustration. And because 
of the Mushin, Frustration ended in 
the Madness. The Way was an at- 
tempt to cut off this inevitable 
sequence by practicing Non-action 
or Passivity. The Spiritual exercises 
and Physical Disciplines of the Way 
(aught the control necessary' to rein 
in Desire, to enclose it behind an 
iron wall of rigid Passivity. Action 
based on personal Desire must be 
avoided. For one Action always en- 
gendered another. And that, in turn, 

GALAXY 




brought on another. No single Ac- 
tion could ever satisify Desire once 
it ruled a man, and so the chain of 
Desire and Action would lead to 
Frustration and eventually to the 
Madness. 

Jerome had fallen into just such a 
sequence when he allowed himself 
to be ruled by the personal desire to 
follow the Way of the Sword. His 
Desire had forced him to the Action 
of requesting an Audience. Arrd the 
Audience' had led to the Action of 
killing the Grandfather. 

Now more Action was required. 
Never had he understood the Way 
of Passivity more clearly. He had 
acted, and now he must act again. 
In doing so he was that much closer 
to the Madness. But he had to act, 
for he knew he could no longer stay 
at the Brotherhood. He didn’t know 
what the Fathers would do when 
they discovered his crime, but his 
Desire for life made him unwilling 
to find out. The Fathers didn’t 
exactly worship the Grandfather, 
but they did revere and obey the 
alien. Even Father Ribaud looked 
upon the Grandfathers as Mankind’s 
saviours from the Mushin and the 
Madness. There could be little 
doubt that the Fathers would be 
shocked by what he had done. How 
shocked, how angered, he could not 
guess. But it was perfectly possible 
that in their anger they might lose 
control and leave an opening for the 
Mushin to come pouring in. Jerome 
shuddered inwardly. All the Fathers 
were Masters of at least one of the 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



Ways. Whether it be the Fist, the 
Staff, or the Sword, all were deadly. 
He had no wish to face even one 
of them possessed by the Madness. 

Now he must act again. He must 
leave the brotherhood. Every 
thought, every motion, must be 
geared to the satisfaction of his De- 
sire to leave the Brotherhood. One 
error, one misstep, and he faced 
Death. 

So. First he had to figure the lay 
of the land. He listened for some 
hint of what was happening in the 
world outside the dark cell. Quiet. 
Everything was quiet. Which meant 
no one knew! Surely if any of the 
Brothers knew he had killed the 
Grandfather they would be there to 
take him into custody! So no one 
knew. Yet. 

What was more, there didn’t 
seem to be any Mushin about. He 
felt with his mind, searching for the 
telltale tingling sensation they made 
at the edge of the mind. Again he 
felt a sense of surpise. Somehow 
his killing rage had gone undetected 
by the Mushin as well! 

This was food for thought. It was 
easy to understand how his act had 
escaped the notice of the Fathers; 
the Grandfather had no regular at- 
tendants, except for the Messengers 
who came when they were called. 
Hence there had been no Fathers in 
the area when the killing had occur- 
red. In addition, he had been swift 
and silent. But the Mushin, how 
had his rage escaped the Mushin? 
Had his sudden collapse after the 

115 




blow somehow saved him? Could a 
killing go undetected by the 
Mushin? 

The Mushin! Icy recollection ran 
like a swift chill up his spine. Just 
before he had risen to strike he had 
seen some kind of a link between 
the Mushin and the Grandfather. 
On the face of it, the idea seemed 
absurd. How could the benefactors 
of Mankind be linked with their 
enemies? 

And yet . and yet . there 
could be no mistaking what the 
Grandfather had been trying to do. 
Jerome knew because he had exper- 
ienced it. The Grandfather had been 
trying to break down his control, to 
take over his mind. If the alien had 
succeeded, Jerome would have been 
helpless to fend off the Mushin, 
helpless in the face of the Madness. 

Thought followed thought to die 
place where doubts dwelt. Just what 
were the Grandfathers? Where had 
they come from? Why had they 
saved Mankind from the Mushin? 
What was in it for them? These 
were questions all men asked them- 
selves but seldom spoke aloud. 
Mankind’s debt to the grandfathers 
was too great to allow room for 
much questioning. 

Jerome shook his mind free of 
the circling doubts. Now was no 
time for speculation. He had to act. 
The mystery of the motivations of 
the Grandfathers and their possible 
link with the Mushin would have to 
wait, i 

He looked at the shape sitting 

116 



headless at the other end of the Ko 
mat. The alien had done something 
to his mind. He couldn’t repress a 
slight shiver. 

The thing was dead now, though. 
It could no longer hurt him. Curi- 
ousity grew stronger than fear and 
he found himself rising and stepping 
over to examine the upright body. 
No one had ever had such a chance 
to examine a Grandfather before. 

A shock ran through him. 

He stood looking down into an 
empty husk! 

The body was hollow! 

There was nothing. No vital or- 
gans, no blood, no flesh. Nothing! 
Dazed, he turned to the wall. A 
step brought him to the shattered 
head. He stopped to pick it up: it 
too was empty. A brittle, empty shell. 

So the Grandfathers, like the 
Mushin, were non-physical, their 
insect-like shells a mere empty 
masquerade. Like the Mushin? 
Perhaps the relationship was closer, 
much closer! 

Battered, reeling from shock after 
shock, Jerome’s mind was pushed 
over the edge, out into space, out 
where there was no place to stand 
and fight, out where his iron control 
meant nothing. He felt reality 
blasted to the winds of Reality. He 
had to fall eternally into chaos and 
Madness or find his wings and fly. 

He became unsane. He passed the 
boundaries of Self and looked back 
at the pathetic creature which stood 
in a dark cell and held the crumpled 
head of a Grandfather in its hand. 



GALAXY 




He saw himself with complete ob- 
jectivity, as he really was. He saw 
the hollowness of the Alien’s shell. 
And the hollowness of his own. 

His shell. His armour. The be- 
loved wall of control he had so 
carefully and lavishly constructed. It 
did not enclose some lovely garden, 
some orderly place that had to be 
protected against the dangers of the 
outside world. Within those iron 
walls there was no calm, no Passiv- 
ity, nothing to mirror or match the 
rigid exterior. There was only a 
vast, foul, seething void of incohe- 
rent passion and desire, a cesspool 
of terror held back by the weakest 
of restraints. 

He knew this was the Truth. The 
Passivity was shallow, a brittle 
shell, a lie that gave a smiling face 
to a snarling beast. It did not go to 
the core. It simply contained it. 

Like a visiting specter, he floated 
through the agony that filled his 
Center. He heard again the bellows 
of his father, writhing in his bonds 
as three Ronin raped and murdered 
his mother. Once more he pulled 
his parents’ bodies from the burn- 
ing house. His fear of the older Sons 
was there too, as were the fights 
behind the Refectory, and the 
drubbings he had had to endure in 
silence. 

All the anguish of his life was 
there. All compressed, all repressed 
behind the control the Passivity 
taught. 

He knew this was the Truth. The 
Passivity did not do what the 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



It is the 21st century, but Scop is in 
1963— attending assassinations. He's 
warned, cajoled, pleaded ... but he

Grandfathers claimed. It did not set 
men free from Desire. Desire was 
still there, made more intense than 
ever by being subverted and hidden. 
The Passivity did not do away with 
the Frustration caused by Action. It 
merely changed the nature of the 
Frustration and locked it behind the 
iron control of the Spiritual Exer- 
cises and Physical Disciplines. 

He knew this was the Truth and 
the Light of it shone brightly on his 
soul. So bright was the Light that 
he could see the Way he must fol- 
low. A brief, dim glimpse, but a 
seeing none the less. 

The Center must be Calm. The 
Way of the Passivity did not ac- 
complish this. His Way lay up the 
path to the clearing on the Mountain 
where the Old Master sat, waiting. 

117 



There he would study the Way of 
the Sword. There he would seek to 
calm his Center so that the walls of 
control were no longer necessary. 
There he would reach for the Way 
to set all Mankind on Kensho free 
of the Grandfathers and free of the 
Mushin and the Madness. The Light 
did not show him the end of the 
Way he must follow. But it showed 
him the beginning. 

Gradually the Light dimmed and 
he became Brother Jerome, standing 
in a dark cell with the crumpled 
head of a Grandfather in his hand. 
Carefully, almost gently, he placed 
the head back on the floor, turned 
and walked softly to the door of the 
cell. 

Now he had to tune his every 
sense to escape. He no longer 
feared Action, nor Frustration, nor 
the Madness. Action was necessary 
to the following of his Way. He 
peered out one of the cracks be- 
tween the planks. He saw nothing. 
Startled, he realized it was dark. 
Which meant he must have been sit- 
ting with the Grandfather for hours! 
He pressed his ear to the door, lis- 
tening for outside activity, for the 
sound of the bell in the Meditation 
Hall, for the clash of dishes from 
the Refectory, for anything that 
could give him a clue as to what 
was happening outside. 

Nothing. The world was still. 

That could only mean it was late 
at night, long after all the Novices, 
Sons, and Fathers had finished Eve- 
ning Sitting and gone to their cells 

118 



for Final Meditation and Rest. In 
other words, the Brotherhood was 
asleep. There were Novices guard- 
ing the North and South Ways, of 
course, but Jerome could avoid 
them and go over the wall. 

Slowly he opened the door out- 
ward, its squeak startling him with 
its loudness. Cautiously he looked 
around, then stepped out and gently 
closed the door behind him, winc- 
ing at the sound. No one heard. The 
world remained silent. 

A breeze blew across his face, 
making him suddenly aware he was 
sweating. He grimaced. I’m afraid, 
he thought. Scared. Walking softly 
as he had been trained by the Fist 
Master, Jerome crossed the Empti- 
ness. He moved South, around the 
Meditation Hall, hollow and cold in 
the light of two of Kensho’s four 
moons. Beyond that was the prac- 
tice yard for the Soft Way. He 
passed quickly, gently, then turned 
to the east toward the wall and his 
own cell. 

The breeze blew steadily, cooling 
his forehead and chasing through 
his hair. All around him the silence 
kept watch. Once he heard the 
ting-ting of the North Way Watch 
sounding the hour and the South 
Way Watch responding. It was the 
second hour. He had been with the 
Grandfather for at least twelve 
hours! 

At the door of his cell he 
stopped. Why had he come back 
here? There was nothing within. 
Only his bowl, his knife, and a 

GALAXY 




spare robe. Oh, yes, and an old, 
worn pair of sandals. 

One more thing, too. One more 
thing. Something he never admitted 
he had, never showed to anyone, 
almost never looked at himself. It 
was under the straw pallet. He 
reached under the thin mattress and 
groped for it. 

When his fingers closed over its 
cool hardness, he drew it forth. It 
was a small badge, attached to a 
crudely made chain. His mother had 
worn it' around her neck. He had 
taken it from her dead body as he 
sat mourning amid the smoke and 
stink of the farmstead at Waters 
Meeting. It was his father’s actual- 
ly, something that had been handed 
down from father to son ever since 
the Early Days. Jerome held it up in 
the beam of moonslight that filtered 
into his cell from the ventilation slit 
in the ceiling. He could just make 
out the words inscribed on the dull 
surface: “P. Rausch Chief En- 
gineer,” He slipped the chain over 
his head and hid the badge beneath 
the coarse cloth of his robe. 

Moving swiftly now, anxious to 
leave, he placed the sandals, bowl, 
knife, and a pair of eating sticks on 
the spare robe. He folded the bot- 
tom up and rolled the whole thing 
into a tight knot to hold the loose 
items. A string around the middle 
assured it wouldn’t come apart. 
Finally he looped the whole thing 
around one shoulder and across his 
waist and tied the sleeves in front. 

Once outside again, he turned 

SEEKER OF THE WAY 



north along the wall and began 
walking. He passed a few of the 
Workshops and finally came abreast 
of the east end of the practice yard 
where the Way of the Sword was 
taught. For a moment he paused, 
then he entered the yard and walked 
swiftly to the rack where the swords 
were kept. Fondly he took down his 
favorite sword, Whistler, and held it 
lovingly. 

For a few moments he stood 
there gazing at it, experiencing 
the good memories it awakened of 
hours sweating in the sun perfect- 
ing his stroke and cut. Father 
Ribaud’s presence filled the 
moonslit yard and Jerome felt a 
lump in his throat. The old man 
would be stunned by what had hap- 
pened. Jerome would give anything 
to see him one last time, to attempt 
to explain what had happened, what 
his revelation had shown, and what 
path he must now follow. But as 
much as he loved the Sword Master 
he realized they could not com- 
municate on certain things, that 
their views were too widely 
divergent to make understanding 
possible. Sympathy, yes. But not 
true understanding. 

He must go his own way now. 
He would take Father Ribaud with 
him, in his heart, wherever he 
went. But the journey itself must be 
made alone. 

And the sword, Whistler, should 
he take it with him? The world he 
was entering was dangerous and the 
sword might make the difference

between survival and death. He 
paused only a moment and then re- 
turned the sword to the rack. 

No, it wasn’t right. Not because 
it would be stealing, but because he 
knew intuitively that he would have 
to earn his sword, not just take it. 
He knew he was increasing his 
chance of death greatly by not tak- 
ing the weapon, but that risk was 
one he had known about when he 
had decided to walk the Way. Now 
he was a Seeker of the Way. He 
would have to find his own sword 
somewhere on the journey. He 
bowed to the Shrine of the practice 
yard and left. 

Jerome was now almost to the 
northeast corner of the wall sur- 
rounding the Brotherhood. Here 
there were some sheds with sloping 
roofs that were used for the storage 
of tools. They offered easy access 
to the top of the wall. Looking 
around briefly one last time, Jerome 
began to climb. 



IV. 

All four moons were up now. 
From the rise where Jerome stood, 
he could look back down the valley 
cut by the Little Water and see both 
the dark bulk of the Brotherhood 
and the far-off smudge that marked 
the site of the farmstead at Waters 
Meeting. It was as if this life was 
laid out before him in the 
moonslight. He turned and looked 
the other way. In the near fore- 
120 



ground the Wood began. Beyond that 
he could see the dark mass of 
Mountain and nothing more. That 
was his future. Dark and unknown. 

He turned back to look at the 
Brotherhood. A great, heavy sad- 
ness and sense of inadequacy filled 
him. I go to find myself and to seek 
salvation for my race, he thought. 
One man, one young man, I seek 
the Way. So great a task for one 
man. 

Yet that was how it had always 
been, he realized. One man. One 
man fitting a stone blade to a 
wooden shaft. One man tying a 
sinew to a springy twig. 

The dark mood lifted and he 
chuckled. He could just imagine 
how the Mushin must be trembling 
at the terrible threat he represented. 
Much the way the saber-toothed 
tiger must have trembled at the first 
man who carried a stone ax. Puny, 
he thought with a smile. That’s 
what the tiger must have thought. 
Puny and insignificant. And so he 
would appear to the Mushin. A joke 
at best. 

But neither the saber-tooth nor 
any of the other fanged and clawed 
enemies of early man were laughing 
any longer. Now it was the 
Mushin ’s turn. 

He shook his fist at the empty 
sky. “I go to find a Way,” he 
called out. Only the silence an- 
swered him. 

With a shrug, the Seeker of the 
Way turned and strode off under the 
soft glow of Kensho’s moons. ★

All right, I know: the above list 
of books has you all goggle-eyed 
and you can’t wait to get to the re- 
views. Well, you’ll just have to 
wait. I have, God help me, a 
speech to make. 

Along about February I asked 
you people for feedback on this 
column. As I write, it’s March, and 
I’m still shoveling my way out from 
under the deluge of mail that en- 
sued. I’ve gotten to know quite a 
few of you, and I’ve learned that, 
almost to a man, you are passionate 
in your likes and dislikes. Nor are 

121 



you reticent about expressing them. 
A startling number of you asked me 
things like, “Can you use your in- 
fluence” (forsooth!) “to get the 
publishers to stop printing that 

” (supply your 

own) “stuff and give us some more 

good old ?” 

Well the hell with that noise. Do 
it yourself. 

You can too. Let me tell you 
about my “influence,” people. I 
can get books free — but the word 
“free” is a misnomer: I must read 
all those books, and the majority 
are wretched. I can irritate or 
gratify those editors who bother to 
read my column (maybe 5% of the 
total?), with the sum total effect 
that such editors will either buy me 
or omit to buy me a drink the next 
time I run into them. Likewise the 
writers involved. The publishers? 
They don’t know that I’m alive, and 
unless I ever write a New York 
Times Bestseller, they never will. 

But there is a way for me to 
communicate my opinions to all of 
those people, in a way forceful 
enough to demand their attention. 
And that same channel is available 
to you, to e'very one of you goom- 
bahs, if you’ll only get up off your 
hindquarters and use it. I’m not 
talking about writing letters to the 
publishers, or holding demonstra- 
tions, or sending letter-bombs 
through the post or forming vig- 
ilante committees to hang the hacks 
from the housetops. I’m talking 
about the Hugo Awards. 

122 



You take a fine thoughtful writer 
like George R.R. Martin. Years of 
a story here, a story there, and I’m 
sorry but that deal for your anthol- 
ogy just fell through. Then the man 
wins a (thoroughly deserved) Hugo 
for “A Song For Lya,” and all of a 
sudden New Voices Volume One is 
scheduled for release and people are 
falling over themselves to buy 
George’s first novel After The Fes- 
tival (George’s very words). Or take 
a fine, thoughtful writer like me: I’m 
here to tell you that it got a lot 
easier to sell a novel to a house like 
Putnam when the Hugo-voters at 
Discon II voted me the John W. 
Campbell Award for Best New 
Writer back in 1974 (in a tie, I 
must add, with the highly talented 
and too-seldom-seen Lisa Tuttle). 
The point is, the voice of the people 
was heard in the land, and it helped 
the people get the books they 
wanted to see. 

But I’d hate to tell you the actual 
number of votes I received, or the 
number that any Hugo or Hugo- 
related award winner gets. At last 
year’s World Science Fiction Con- 
vention, the awarding of the label 
World’s Best was done by less than 
six hundred people. 

I’ve received more letters than 
that, from you feedbackers. 

I know the damn thing was held 
halfway around the world; that’s en- 
tirely irrelevant. 

You don’t have to attend a 
Worldcon to vote. Anyone can. 
Anyone — anyone in the world. You 

GALAXY 




don’t have to have credentials or 
be vaccinated or even have the 
money to drag your ass to Kansas 
City for this year’s jamboree to make 
your feelings known. It’ll cost you 
six bucks, two postage stamps, and 
a little time. 

You write to MidAmeriCon, the 
34th World Science Fiction Conven- 
tion, P.O. Box 221, Kansas City, 
Missouri 64141, and you tell ’em 
you want a supporting membership, 
and you- slip ’em six bucks U.S. 
This bread is used for about a mil- 
lion things that taken together make 
a convention happen, from paying 
us pros to bullshit, to paying the 
poor sad bastards who’re going to 
have to count your ballots. In return 
you get probably a bunch of litera- 
ture, a tin-plated Mars bar, the 
hearty thanks of a convention com- 
mittee that came out in the black 
after all, AND the right to cast your 
vote for the Hugo Awards. 

But only if you hurry. 

Dammit, here’s where that time- 
lag between the writing of these 
columns and their seeing print really 
hurts. As of today, March 22, I 
have not yet received even my pre- 
liminary Hugo ballot, the mass of 
suggestions which will, after 
months of deletions and write-ins, 
become the Final Ballot. But by the 
time you read this, that ballot will 
already have been selected, and 
they might not even have time to 
mail you a copy in time for you to 
vote on it — I don’t know just what 
their deadline is going to be, but 

BOOKSHELF 



you’ll be reading this in June or 
July, which is mighty close to 
Labor Day. So you’re going to have 
to put out a little juice on your own 
to find out who the finalists are, 
and dammit, you should be in- 
terested enough. You can always 
write-in something. 

I heard you. You, the cheapskate 
who just said, “Si x bucks? Jeez.” 

Well, don’t gimme any of that 
jive. From the mail I’ve been get- 
ting, it’s apparent that the vast 
majority of you spend more than six 
dollars a month buying science fic- 
tion, and end up feeling ripped off 
more often than not. You are indig- 
nant; you want me to do something 
about it. 

Phooey — spend one month’s six 
bucks on improving the overall 
quality of next year’s sf. The return 
on your investment will be literally 
priceless. 

And next year you can even get it 
together in time to influence the 
composition of the Final Ballot. 



Editor’s note: doe to a delay in 
publication this issue will be 
reaching the stands sometime 
after the Final Balloting for 
1976. However everything 
Spider says holds true for 1977; 
and you can get in at the begin- 
ning. Write to SUNCON (the 
35th World Science Fiction Con- 
vention, or WORLDCON ’77), 
P.O. Box 3427, Cherry Hill, NJ 
08002 for your application for 
full or supporting membership.

Make your wishes known, 
people. For too long the awards 
have been given by too few 
hardcore devotees; tell the nice pub- 
lishers what you want. 

* * * 

I also got a couple of letters 
from people who said, “I wish 
Galaxy would stop making snide 
cracks about ‘that Other magazine, 
the one with rivets.’ Such rivalry is 
unbecoming,” etc. These good 
people have entirely missed the 
point. There is no animosity be- 
tween Galaxy and Analog: aside 
from liking each other, Baen and 
Bova are too damned sensible — they 
understand that science fiction just 
doesn’t work that way. You can’t 
climb over the backstabbed bodies 
of your adversaries — there aren’t 
any. 

For those of you who are still 
dubious (man, the world has never 
seen an Age of Cynicism till now), 
here I am in the pages of Galaxy 
saying that Ben Bova has just writ- 
ten the 1976 Hugo Award Novel. 

At least he’s sure and hell got my 
vote so far. Granted, the year is 
young — but it’ll be mighty damn 
hard to beat this one, Millenium is 
the crowning achievement of Ben’s 
career to date, and enthusiastically 
praised by the likes of Isaac Asimov 
and Lester Del Rey, has already 
sold to Ballantine for paperback, 
and I want to tell you I haven’t en- 
joyed a book so much in years. It is 

124 



one of those rarities, a good science 
fiction book that is also a good 
novel in the literary sense. 

It is the story of the apotheosis 
of Chester Arthur Kinsman, the 
man Ben’s been writing about for 
most of his adult life, and it does 
both men proud. Millenium con- 
cerns the political state of affairs on 
Earth and the Moon in the year 
1999, a time when the Cold War 
between America and Russia has 
been thawed and reheated, damned 
near the boiling point. At any mo- 
ment, one side or the other may 
complete its network of ABM satel- 
lites, upsetting at last the precious 
Balance of Terror and precipitating 
nuclear calamity — in fact, they may 
not even wait that long. Caught on 
the horns of this dilemma are 
Kinsman and Piotr Leonov, com- 
manders of the American and Rus- 
sian bases on the Moon. These 
bases were established back when 
both sides were getting along 
amicably — and now that their re- 
spective countries are being hostile 
again, Kinsman and Leonov are 
dismayed to realize that they must 
become enemies. Can they refuse? 
And get away with it? Therein lies 
the story, and a helluva plausible 
one, too. I won’t give any more 
away; there are some lovely sur- 
prises planted. 

The book builds steadily and in- 
exorably to a stunning conclusion, 
with one of the most moving final 
paragraphs in my memory, and 
along the way is one of the most 

GALAXY 




sheerly believable stories in science 
fiction. I’m not saying that 1999 
will turn out as Ben pictures it — but 
I do say that it damned well 
could — and that we’ll probably be 
very lucky if it does. Oh yeah: 
Harry Harrison is in the book too, 
in the thinnest of disguises, as bril- 
liant and charming and disreputable 
as he is in real life. 

I understand Fred Pohl has a 
novel coming out that’s a strong 
Hugo contender, but as of now 
Millenium is my firm recommen- 
dation for Best Novel of 1976 (for 
those of you who’re heeding my 
advice about voting, remember that 
you vote for the ’76 Hugos in 
1977, not this year), and I strongly 
exhort you not to wait for it to 
come out in paperback. This is one 
of the few books that I feel is worth 
$7.95, no matter what the hell 
shape your budget’s in. 

* * * 

Next on the agenda is a peachy 
original anthology; and the editor is 
the selfsame Ben Bova. And like 
Millenium, The Analog Annual is 
predicated on a careful analysis of 
current trends in the real world. 

The statistics boys will tell you, 
if you hadn’t noticed already, that 
there’s a vast number of new read- 
ers of sf — we’ve never had so large 
an audience in all of history. And it 
is sad but true that a large and 
growing number of these new 

BOOKSHELF 



“fans” (they may not trade fanzines 
or attend cons, but they put oil in 
my Dodge) are only peripherally 
aware or not aware atall that there 
are magazines that print the stuff 
every month — folks who get their sf 
from the bookrack or not at all. 
There may have been a time when 
the overall quality of “book” sf 
was higher than that of “mag” sf, 
but if so I’m here to tell you them 
days is gone forever. Unless you’re 
wise enough to read my column, 
your chances of getting a good orig- 
inal collection are, by my statistics, 
lower than your chances of getting a 
good given issue of Galaxy or 
Analog or F&SF. Much, lower, in 
fact: you can get an idea of the kind 
of stories Jim or Ben or Ed is liable 
to assemble — but who the hell 
knows what Roger Elwood’s going 
to do next time? 

So Ben decided to alert the pa- 
perback buyers to the existence of 
magazine sf, by producing a “Thir- 
teenth Analog” in paperback for- 
mat. Not surprisingly, the dice are 
loaded: if every Analog were this 
good, there wouldn’t be enough 
paper in the world to meet the de- 
mand. 

Look: it’s like I said a couple of 
paragraphs ago, each of the so- 
called Big Four editors has a sort of 
style that can be sensed, based on 
the audience he has decided to aim 
at. Ben tends to buy more 
technologically-oriented stories 
whereas Jim tends to buy more hu- 
manistically inclined stories whereas 

125 




Ed Ferman at F&SF tends to buy 
more “Lit ’rate” pieces whether or 
not they are actual stories whereas 
Ted White tends to buy whatever 
the first three rejected. These glib 
generalizations, of course, have 
about as many exceptions as the 
geocentric universe theory: Ben has 
bought stories from me that are 
about as technological as a pair of 
scissors; Jim has bought the only 
technological story I ever wrote, 
and Ferman and White have printed 
many fine, readable stories — but the 
above is how the Big Four are sort 
of filed in my subconscious as of 
even date. 

So what Ben put together is a 
book that should satisfy just about 
everybody. 

Story One is a complete short 
novel (a sadly neglected form — by 
the writers who could do it right, 
that is) by P.J. Plauger. When 
Plauger won the John W. Campbell 
Award for 1975, the only story of 
his that 1 could call to mind was 
“Wet Blanket,” so I’ve been eager 
to see something more. Fighting 
Madness will do just fine, an ab- 
sorbing novel with a Gordy- 
Dicksonish flavor to it that means 
an extremely high level of 
craftsmanship for so new a writer. 
Plauger shows magnificent promise. 
I’d like to see a more ambitious 
theme next time, but I believed in 
the protagonist and cared what hap- 
pened to him and that, in the final 
analysis, will get my penny every 
time. 



Story Two is “Malf,” a yarn 
which should satisfy the technology 
freaks and certainly satisfied me. 
It’s in the tradition of “Killdozer” 
and Keith Laumer’s Bolo Combat 
Unit cycle: the Bigass Machine 
Gone Berserk story. Except that 
there’s a human operator — and he's 
the one that’s berserk. A fine, tight, 
fast-paced adventure with a “read 
me” style: I’ve never heard of Ing 
before, but I hope I do again, soon. 

Story Four is “The Tower of 
Ashes” by Hugo Award winner 
George Railroad Martin, a story 
literary enough to satisfy the New 
Wavers (right down to the 
“Whadhesay?” ending) and rich 
enough to satisfy me. It reminds me 
of something Poul Anderson might 
have done, grabbing at your heart in 
a way that is getting to be George’s 
trademark too, lately. It features his 
usual striking visual sense as well. 

Story Five isn’t a story — this is a 
typical Analog, remember? It’s a 
Science Fact Article (which Analog 
gets free-lance, not having a Jerry 
Poumelle), this time by Dr. John R. 
Gribbin, co-author of The Jupiter 
Effect (a controversial Vintage 
paperback concerning earthquakes 
and the planets), holder of a doc- 
torate in astrophysics from Cam- 
bridge, etcetera. “The Climatic 
Threat” gives a well-researched and 
thoughtful answer to the question, 
‘ ‘Are we liable to go into a new Ice 
Age in the foreseeable future?”, 
and diminished my ignorance con- 
siderably. And painlessly. 



126 



GALAXY 




And for those of you who are 
wondering what happened to Story 
Three, I’m afraid my rigid code of 
professional ethics prevents me 
from saying anything more than that 
it’s the funniest thing I ever wrote 
and was originally rejected on the 
grounds that Playboy would pay me 
more money for it (no they 
wouldn’t either) and besides, I don’t 
get a penny in royalties anyway, so 
there. It is, by the way, as far as I 
know' the only story in history with 
one and a half protagonists, and it’s 
called “Half An Oaf’ which is cer- 
tainly better than a nun. 

* * * 

And still I’m not done with Ben 
Bova. 

But the appeal of this one won’t be 
so catholic. In fact, it’s liable to be one 
of the most controversial books of the 
year. I know of at least three people, 
in and out of the profession, who were 
rendered speechless with rage by 
it — and as many who said it made 
them cheer out loud. 

Because, of course, it’s mistitled. It 
should be Notes To An Analog Writer, 
Slushpile Division, as Ben cheerfully 
admits in his preface. “This book was 
written in self-defense,” is literally 
the first thing he has to say. Ben is the 
only magazine editor I know who 
reads every manuscript submitted to 
him, an incredible task that you 
couldn’t get me to attempt for all the 
tea in Acupulco. So what he has writ- 
ten here is NOT How To Write A

Good Story or What A Good Story Is 
or What SF Consists Of. It is How To 
Not Get a Story Bounced At Analog 
Out Of Hand. 

Given five minutes you can prob- 
ably come up with a half dozen Hugo 
or Nebula Award Winners that ignore 
or defy the conventions Ben describes 
in Notes: none of them are by 
slushpile writers. Many writers and 
fans will flatly reject Ben’s notion of 
what constitutes a publishable story: 
none of them are published in 
Analog. I’ve read several fanzine 
writers who blast Notes for its fail- 
ure to be an exhaustive guide on 
how to survive as a writer: none of 
them, apparently, read the Preface. 

And by damn, the rules Ben lays 
down seem sound to me. There are 
gems of editorial insight for the tyro, 
classic pitfalls delineated by one of the 
men who’s seen ’em all. Ben points 
out, for instance, that to work a story 
must center around a conflict — and 
that slam-bang action is not conflict. 
He also urges the beginner to write 
about what he knows about — new 
writers shouldn’t bluff. That’s why 
my first stories were about drink. 

Enough. The avant garde will 
doubtless castigate this book — but it 
strikes me that people as diverse as 
Robert Heinlein and William Shakes- 
peare told their stories by these rules, 
and I believe both of those gentlemen 
made a living. 

* * * 

Now for a book I’m going to devote 

128 



a good deal of space to. It’s only fair: 
it took up an inordinate chunk of my 
reading time. 

Shardik is no bigger than the com- 
plete five-borough New York City 
Phonebook, if you add in the Cross- 
Indices by number and address (the 
one only cops and politicians get). 
And Richard Adams is pretty heavy 
too. 

Yep, the same Adams as wrote Wa- 
tership Down , who “achieved Tol- 
kienian stature’’ with his first novel, 
back again with a massive work about 
twice as good as the last one. And 
easily twice as long. It’s much more 
ambitious in theme and scope, with a 
profundity that Watership lacked and 
broader allegorical relevance. It con- 
cerns the spiritual odyssey undergone 
by one man during his transition from 
simple hunter to Emperor of Bekla 
to . no, I won’t spoil it. It is the 
story of the maturing process he 
undergoes in his attempt to grasp and 
manifest the Will of God. It is also the 
story of religious and political up- 
heaval on a broad scale. 

I found it an exhausting but satisfy- 
ing book. It was difficult to get 
through the first two hundred pages 
(there are over six hundred) — not that 
it wasn’t well-written or that it started 
jerkily — but Adams has a tendency to 
never use one simile where three will 
do, and I was quite a while convincing 
myself that the sheer effort of wading 
through all those words was going to 
be rewarding enough. He paints his 
pictures with such verbose precision, 
so much wordy fine tuning of nuance 

GALAXY 




and evocation, such careful over- 
statement, so much defining and rede- 
fining, such insistence on being more 
unnecessarily redundant than is abso- 
lutely necessary, so much . I think 
you get the idea. About half the sen- 
tences in the book begin with 
“As ...” and meander along for 
whole paragraphs before they even get 
as far as, “. so, therefore, 
did . .” 

On the other hand, they are richly 
evocative similes for the most part. 
There’s just so damned many of them. 

So okay, the man could have used 
an editor — but how do you go about 
convincing a guy who has raves from 
both Timeses and virtually every 
book-reviewer covering English- 
language novels that he needs to prune 
off about forty or fifty thousand 
words? And as it stands Shardik is a 
mighty fine book, less a case of too 
much fat than one of too much red 
meat. 

My only other major objection is 
that Adams’s allegory strained my 
credibility just a bit. Look, the book 
centers around the heroic figure of 
Shardik himself, an incredibly 
enormous and terrible bear who wan- 
ders out of the forest one day to alter 
irrevocably the lives and ^estinies of 
everyone within five thousand 
miles — but the manner of his doing so 
was just a little too pat and contrived. 
No single thing that he did was im- 
plausible on the face of it — but taken 
together, they advance Adams’s plot 
just a little too conveniently to ring 
true. 



Unless — and this is a big unless— 
you’re willing to concede that Shardik 
just might be what the Ortelgans mis- 
take him for: the Power of God incar- 
nate. 

Adams comes across as a man who 
may have yet to learn fully the disci- 
pline of his craft, but already shows 
the vision and style of a potential mas- 
ter. I feel it’s a terrible shame that the 
vicissitudes of his life and his lioniz- 
ing critics have prevented him from 
having an apprenticeship. Shardik is 
an ever-so-slightly flawed master- 
piece — and it could have been a per- 
fect book. 

But damn, he writes well. 

And don’t be misled by the fact that 
his last book was about rabbits; this 
man writes with plenty muscle when 
he wants to, with the kind of impact 
that only the heavyweights like Brun- 
ner and Bester and Sturgeon and 
MacDonald can pull off, that “unex- 
pected body-blow” kind of delivery 
that makes you re-read some sen- 
tences four times over before going 
on. 

Also his characterization is excel- 
lent: I believed in and cared about 
virtually every character in the book, 
including the bear — even if the love- 
interest subplot did seem a bit per- 
functory and afterthoughtish. Kel- 
derek Play-With-The-Children is a 
master’s creation, and so is the 
Tuginda, and so is the Ban of Sarkid, 
and so is the ghastly forced march of 
the child slaves which forces the book 
toward its powerful ending. 

I wish I could recommend the pa-

mass, though, the hardcover is some- 
thing of a bargain at a sawbuck. 

Wait’ll you see next year’s prices. 

(I saw a forty cent paperback last 
week. Brand new, honest to god. 
Forty cents. The proprietor of the 
bookstore was as flabbergasted as I 
was; he refused to part with it. “I’m 
going to keep it on the wall there,’’ he 
said, “and just look at it now and 
then.”) 

* * * 

And so, in our continuing cover- 
age. of the Veddy Best in Literature, 
we come to Samuel R. Delany’s 
latest novel, Triton. I’m happy to 
say that it isn’t as opaque as Dhal- 
gren, but I’m sorry to say that it too 
bored the pants off me. 

But I must point out that that’s a 
purely subjective judgment on my 
part. A good friend of mine de- 
scribes Triton as “a fascinating 
character-study of a man whose 
basic assumptions prevent him from 
relating successfully to those around 
him,” and I can’t disagree with 
that. What it most certainly is not is 
a story, or a science fiction novel. 

Oh, there are science fictional 
trappings. But they’re about as 
genuine as those on the paperback’s 
cover: a collection of objects which 
taken together are supposed to be an 
artifically maintained city-state on 

130 



Triton, with Neptune looming large 
in the background. Examine the 
hardware closely: the “city” is 
composed of two queens, a bishop 
and three pawns; a vanity mirror, a 
Neosynephrine squeeze bottle, a 
hose coupling, a resealer for pop- 
top soda bottles, an oil-squirter can, 
a pipe-rack identical to the one I 
bought my Dad ten years ago for 
Christmas, and a throwing dart im- 
paled on a resistor. Don’t believe 
me, go take a look. “Neptune” too 
is way off, with no clouds and a 
girdle of craters. 

The world-of-the-future that De- 
lany creates seems to me utterly un- 
relieved decadence, although there 
are hints that a few offstage charac- 
ters on Earth (if not Triton) might 
be genuinely alive. There appears to 
be no meaningful work to do, and 
curiously enough, everyone in sight 
is neurotic. The ... I hesitate to 
say “hero” . the protagonist, 
Bron Helstrom, works as a 
metalogician, and his shop talk goes 
like so: “Now, remember, in form- 
al logic, ‘not-P’ had to be taken 
in terms of ‘non-P’, which (if P is 
Farmer Jones’s south acres) includes 
not only the north acres but also the 
problem of the squared circle, the 
inner ring of Saturn, and grief — not 
to mention the Taj Mahal. But 
given what we know of the prob- 
lem, it would be a little silly to ex- 
pect any of these things to come 
into a real solution. Dismissing 
them from consideration is a 
metalogical delimitation, resulting 

GALAXY 




from an examination of the signifi- 
cance space around various syntax 
vectors connecting various words of 
the problem.” 

Yeah. 

The female protagonist, named, 
God help us, “The Spike,” is a 
Great Artist who specializes in stag- 
ing abstract theater on street cor- 
ners, making involuntary performers 
out of passers-by, and it says here 
she’s terrific. If you want a blow- 
by-blow on how Bron’s total and 
utter egocentrism drives her up the 
wall, you’ll love this book. (He 
ends up having a sex change but 
still, somehow, fails to find happi- 
ness). And if you go for appendices 
containing out-takes from the book 
in the context of what seems to 
have been meant as a discussion of 
the science-fiction novel as an art 
form, go to it — if nothing else, 
you’ll learn the answers to exciting 
literary questions like ‘‘is it or- 
thodox to speak of a ‘metonym’ 
rather than ‘metonomy’?” which 
had been keeping me awake nights. 

It may well be that I am simply 
too Neanderthal to understand this 
intellectual tour de force. But I say 
it’s boring, and I say the hell with 
it.

Doorways In The Sand. 

Hmmmm. 

I seem to have put myself on rec- 
ord as a Neanderthal, a man who 
prefers Gool Of Fashioned SF Like 

BOOKSHELF 



They Used To. So it seems odd that 
I should find myself disappointed 
by Roger’s recent output. 

But dammit, my Golden Age 
coincided with the first splashes of 
the New Wave, and I once consid- 
ered myself a card-carrying New 
Waver — until the Wave blundered 
into the ‘‘It can’t be Great Art if 
it’s comprehensible” fallacy. And I 
remember the splendid promise of 
Roger Zelazny. Here was the man 
who was going to combine Heinlein 
and Bradbury for us, writing muscu- 
lar adventure in the language of a 
poet, uniting drama and beauty. 
And what we got is a buncha 
sword- ’n-sorcery and more or less 
conventional adventure-sf — 

comprehensible but unspectacular. 

On the other hand, Delany once 
showed exactly the same 
potential — and now there’s nothing 
left of him but the poet. 

So maybe I should shut my 
mouth and swallow my disappoint- 
ment, because good conventional 
adventures are getting mighty damn 
hard to come by these days. Abso- 
lutely the only thing wrong with 
Doorways In The Sand is that it 
isn’t magnificent. It is an eminently 
readable novel about a perennial 
undergraduate (an uncle’s will cuts 
him off without a dime upon gradu- 
ation) with a penchant for climbing 
(anything) who suffers some re- 
verses (a pun you’ll have to read 
the book to appreciate) when he be- 
comes accidentally involved in 
high-level interstellar intrigue. The 

131 




book features two of the wildest 
cops in history and some distinctly 
zany twists, and you’ll probably 
enjoy it a bunch. 

In fact, if it were by anyone but a 
man of Zelazny’s enormous poten- 
tial, I’d be recommending it unre- 
servedly. So maybe I should any- 
way. A cracking good yam, thin on 
calories but delicious.

What a premise for a book: Sci- 
ence Fiction Art. Gods above, there 
have been some great works turned 
out in the name of adorning sf 
magazines, by some of the most 
talented artists in the world. So 
when I received Brian Aldiss’s 
folio-size paperback, Science Fic- 
tion Art, I put everything else aside 
for awhile, to soak myself in visual 
splendor. 

And came away disappointed. 
The book is mistitled: it should 
have been Science Fiction Magazine 
Art of the Thirties and Forties, With 
a Nod Toward The Fifties and Six- 
ties. To be sure, there was some 
terrific art produced during those 
years — but the better the artist, the 
less space Aldiss gives him. The 
immortal Chesley Bonestell is rep- 
resented by one painting, Hannes 
Bok by one painting and a handful 
of black-and-white illos, and like 
that. Only Virgil Finlay and Ed 
Cartier got anything like the treat- 
ment they deserve, whereas lesser- 
known and less-talented artists get a 

132 



field-day of exposure out of (appar- 
ently) pure nostalgia for the Good 
OF Days when their inept illustra- 
tions were everywhere to be seen. 
Heavy on Bug Eyed Monsters 
menacing blondes in brass bikinis. 
There’s one Leo Summers Analog 
cover as recent as 1974, a Kelly 
Freas of similar vintage, and noth- 
ing whatever by Gaughan, 
Sternbach, Schoenherr, Fabian, 
Freff, Pini, Ames, or Di Fate, let 
alone “comic”-book immortals like 
Kirby, Ditko, Buscema, Heck, 
Steranko or Smith. There is exactly 
one Galaxy cover (along with text 
that implies that H.L. Gold is still 
editing Galaxy — even Sam 
Lundwall was more nearly up to 
date), three Analogs, a handful of 
F&SF s; the balance are from maga- 
zines that, deservedly or not, died 
years ago — often after one or two 
issues. 

Don’t get me wrong — there’s 
some fine stuff in this collection, 
and the repro is excellent. But 
there’s a lot of dead weight too, un- 
less you’re a dedicated nostalgia 
freak — and what the book is not is 
what its title promises: a representa- 
tive sampling of science fiction art. 

I’d like to see one.

One of the better Best Of collec- 
tions comes, not surprisingly, from 
Robert Silverberg: every story there- 
in contained is a gem. They date 
from Bob’s 1954 beginnings to 
1971, and give a clear picture of the 



GALAXY 




growth of a major talent. 
“Hawksbill Station” is here (the 
superior original short version) as 
are “Passengers,” “Nightwings,” 
and “Sundance.” Re-reading them 
gave me several hours of nearly un- 
qualified pleasure. 

The “nearly” part comes from 
the introductions. Bob has appar- 
ently been reading his own critical 
rave's for far too long, and in his in- 
tros comes on with that Asimovian 
feeling of having become so superb 
as to make any further pretense of 
modesty both unnecessary and un- 
seemly. “No sense denying it — I’m 
just a virtuoso.” 

Now understand — I’m not deny- 
ing that Silverbob is a virtuoso. If I 
ever turn out anything as polished 
as his mediocre stuff I’ll be doing 
damned well. But too-certain 
awareness of his own excellence 
can be a terrible thing for a writer. 
It can make him wax Artistic to the 
point of contempt for his audience 
(when they fail to grow with him), 
can even at last make him feel that 
his True genius is beyond them, 
make him stump around the country 
making speeches on Why Writing 
Science Fiction Is Now Beneath 
Him. I understand that Bob has now 
formally and officially renounced 
sf, because of its audience’s low 
taste and intransigence, and nothing 
makes clearer what a tragic waste 
that is than this collection. Because 
of the gushing praise of the Literary 
World and the Academic Squad, we 
have lost a master. 



So go score this book, and read 
some of the heritage he has left us, 
and weep along with me. 

★ ★ ★ 

Good God — I’ve run way the hell 
over my allotted space. That’s okay: 
I had to get that Vote Team Vote 
speech off my chest. 

But it leaves me with almost no 
room to tell you about the reissue 
of Arthur C. Clarke’s Tales of the 
White Hart. These were the first of 
the science-fiction shaggy-dog 
stories, and the spiritual forebears 
of De Camp and Pratt’s 
“Gavaghan’s Bar” series (which, 
unhappily, I’ve never actually seen) 
and my own Callahan’s Place cycle 
(forthcoming from Tempo Books in 
paperback). Tall tales told in a fas- 
cinating and colorful bar, with only 
the most perfunctory of nods toward 
plausibility and with an overabun- 
dance of pure, zany hilarity. Check 
’em out. 

And so at last to Epoch, Elwood 
and Silverberg’s contender for 
Dangerous Visions of the 1970s. If 
this is, in truth, the current state of 
the art, I’m going fishing. The 
enormous volume so thoroughly 
pissed me off that you can obtain 
my opinion by simply dropping the 
letters “PO” from the title. A 
waste of one helluva lotta time. 

And so ends the most enormous 
column so far. Who says Galaxy 
doesn’t give you more for your 
money? ★

me Man at the 




Bottom ol the Sea 




There will always be those who 
seek out danger — and those 
who mourn them. 



After dinner, the two women 
took their drinks to the terrace and 
sat by the ornate railing, where they 
could look down at waves breaking 
against the base of the cliff, fifteen 
meters below. Out over the sea, two 
small, ghostly orange moons paced 
each other down the evening sky. 
The women were content not to 
speak for several minutes. 

Then Emalen Haris set her glass 
aside and pointed at something in 
the water. Gere Vitora de Groot 
peered in the direction indicated but 
could see nothing. 

“What is it?” she asked. 

‘‘You don’t see it? A plesio- 
saur. ’ ’ 

“Here?” Gere finally spotted the 
snake-like neck just as it bowed and 
disappeared in a patch of white 
foam. “What would it be doing so 
far north at this time of year?’ ’ 

“It may have lost its herd. Or it 
could just be a loner. Anyway, 
we’d better report it, before it blun- 
ders into the seafarms.” Emalen 
glanced at her chronometer and 
lightly pressed a fingertip against 
her throatband. 

“Yes, Emalen?” the throatband 
said in clear, neutral tones. 

“Place a call to Sherard Martel, 



please. He should be at his home in 
Seabreeze at this hour.” 

“Yes, Emalen. Do you wish to 
speak to him from the terrace?” 
“No, I’ll take the call in the 
study.” Emalen removed her finger 
from the throatband and rose, a tall, 
good-looking woman of fifty-two 
years, long-limbed and as supple as 
a cat. “Would you like me to get 
you another drink while I’m inside, 
Gere?” 

Gere considered the glass in her 
hand and shook her head. She 
watched Emalen walk into the 
house, and the sight of both filled 
her with a pleasant warmth. 

Emalen had designed and built 
the cliffside house eight years be- 
fore. Her paintings, sculptures and 
mobiles filled it. She had pro- 
grammed the music, colors and 
scents that could be made to flow 
from the walls. She had selected the 
carpets, tapestries, furniture. The 
house was as unmistakably a work 
of art by Emalen Haris as any of 
the pieces she had on permanent 
exhibit in places as close as Martin- 
side, twenty kilometers to the north, 
and as far away as old Earth. 

Gere had not yet made any real 
impression upon the house. Her 
own contributions to it were 
few — an exquisitely wrought metal 
bird from Alpha Centauri IV, in- 
sects in petrified amber from Earth, 
a perfect crystal egg from one of 
the several lifeless worlds orbiting 
Epsilon Indi. Souvenirs from space. 
She sipped her drink and let her 

135

attention wander to the darkening 
sky. A long streak of flame seemed 
to narrowly avoid colliding with one 
of the orange Lovers, the matched 
moons of the evening hours, before 
vanishing as abruptly as it had ap- 
peared. 

Burned up in the atmosphere, she 
wondered idly, or plunged into the 
sea, somewhere over the horizon. 

Gere looked down at the water. 
Approximately fifty meters 
offshore, a spectral silvery light 
glimmered steadily under the sur- 
face. She regarded it thoughtfully 
for a moment, then drained her 
glass and turned her back on the 
night. 

Emalen emerged from the house, 
accompanied by the muted and 
rather melancholy opening strains of 
an ancient concerto. “I talked with 
Sherard,” she said. “He says he’ll 
give orders to keep it away but not 
hurt it.” 

Gere looked at her blankly. 
“What?” 

“Our plesiosaur.” 

“Oh.” Gere smiled fleetingly. 
“I’m sorry. My mind was light- 
years away from sea serpents.” 

“Sherard also asked me to relay 
an invitation. Sometime soon, be- 
fore your furlough’s over, he wants 
you to go with him and his family 
to Jordaens for a weekend. I told 
him you’d think about it.” 

“Should I?” 

Emalen shrugged. “Forewarned 
is forearmed. Sherard ’s pretty ex- 
clusively into sodomy, and he’s not 
136 



even particularly good at it. But I 
think you’d like his friend Harl. 
And his daughter.” 

“I may accept. I may not.” 

Gere tilted her head back and 
stared straight up at the stars, and 
there was a sudden stab of longing 
under her heart. The ache, the 
hunger to go out again, to be in 
space again, had been growing 
steadily worse for the past week. 

It must have showed in her ex- 
pression then, because Emalen 
abruptly came to her and embraced 
her tenderly. Gere put her face into 
the other woman’s hair, smelled a 
subtle scent which she could not 
identify, felt Emalen’s lips brush 
her earlobe. 

“It’s starting to bother you 
now,” Emalen murmured, “isn’t 
it?” 

“Yes. A little.” 

“I know the signs.” 

“I’m sorry, Emalen.” 

“No need to be. I’ve had lots of 
practice coping with it.” Emalen 
put her forehead against Gere’s. “I 
bring it on myself, you know. I 
must be crazy to keep falling in 
love with you people.” 

“It’s the uniform that does it.” 
Emalen gave a quick, almost 
soundless laugh and took her by the 
hand, and they moved to the edge 
of the terrace. The temperature had 
fallen sharply during the last few 
minutes. Gere felt Emalen tremble 
slightly and put an arm about her 
shoulders. Emalen made a grateful 
noise low in her throat. 



GALAXY 




“Do you know what grass 
widows were, Gere?” 

“No.” 

Emalen raised her head and crin- 
kled her elegantly angular face into 
a mock grimace. “You don’t use the 
library often enough, my dear illit- 
erate spacewoman.” 

“I have other virtues. I’m a good 
dancer.” 

“That you are,” Emalen said and 
kissed Gere on the cheek. They 
looked down at the light shimmer- 
ing beneath the waves. Gere heard 
her companion suck in a harsh 
breath that was almost a sob. She 
slipped her arm around the other 
woman’s waist, pressed a cheek 
against her neck. 

Emalen shivered and muttered, 
“I’ll never understand it.” 

“What?” 

“It’s been three years since I 
built that thing out there in the wa- 
ter. Three years, and a new friend 
who has the same need that he had, 
and I still don’t understand it.” 

Gere said nothing. She felt 
somewhat embarrassed. Emalen had 
mentioned the man to her only once 
before, and Gere knew almost noth- 
ing about him, not even his name. 
Only that he, like herself, had had 
to go into space again and again, re- 
turning, tired, drained, sated for a 
short time, after voyages of eigh- 
teen months’ or two years’ duration. 
Only that he had never returned 
from his last voyage.

system, was rising in the east, suf- 
fusing the air with waxy light. High 
above and well to the right of the 
Ogre, another meteor fell and died. 
Gere stared at the spot where it had 
burned itself out. 

“I’m sorry,” she heard Emalen 
murmur. “I’m depressing you. I’m 
sorry.” 

“No. It’s all right.” 

“I love you, Gere.” 

“I love you, too.” 

“It’s just ... I never used to 
worry when he was out there. 
Never. But now I’ve started to 
dread your going. If you didn’t 
come back . .” 

“Emalen. Don’t.” 

Emalen turned in Gere’s embrace 
and faced her. “It’s the not know- 
ing that hurts. Not knowing whether 
you’re alive or dead or just . 
gone. Missing. Like him. I loved 
him dearly, as much as I love 
you. I don’t think I could bear to 
have another person I love simply 
disappear in space.” 

“You want me to give it up, 
don’t you?” 

Emalen smiled a terribly sad 
smile and gave her a warm, linger- 
ing kiss on the mouth. “Don’t ask 
me questions like that one, Gere. 
We both know you wouldn’t be 
able to give it up, any more than I 
could walk away from this house 
and never think another thought 
about art as long as I lived.” She 
sighed loudly. “Well. Let’s not talk 
about it anymore. I’m tired. I think 
I want to go to bed now. Coming?” 
138 



“You’re becoming telepathic in 
your prime.” 

Emalen shook her head emphati- 
cally. “I just want you to have 
something pleasant to dwell upon 
when the Tau Ceti locals have taken 
you captive and are about to feed 
you feet first to their monster mag- 
got god.” 

Hand in hand, they went into the 
house. 

★ ★ ★ 

Emalen was asleep, the breath 
whistling very faintly in her nos- 
trils, when a restless Gere rose from 
her side and de-opaqued first the 
bedroom ceiling and then the wall. 
The Ogre was near zenith, bathing 
the world with soft, cool light. The 
Lovers sat low over the horizon. 

She re-opaqued the room and 
crept out, down the palely illumi- 
nated hall, into the parlor, where 
she asked the house for stronger 
light. There was a clear glass 
pyramid, about seven centimeters 
tall, on a low table. She tapped the 
pyramid with her fingernail, and 
pastel clouds formed within. A low, 
pleasant sound, more of a subtly 
undulating hum than an actual 
melody, filled the room. She lis- 
tened to it for several seconds, then 
deactivated the pyramid with a sec- 
ond tap. The parlor lights dimmed 
behind her as she left. 

She was naked save for her 
throat band, and it was cold outside 
on the terrace. But she went to the 
railing and sat down and listened, 

GALAXY 




shivering, to the waves lapping the 
rocks fifteen meters below. 

Fifty meters from the base of the 
cliff, a light shimmered steadily be- 
neath the surface of the sea. 

As steadily, Gere thought, as the 
stars. 

She touched her throatband. 

“Yes, Gere?” 

“I . .1 want something to wear 
into the water, please. Something 
warm, with a respirator, goggles 
and flippers. And I’ll need a lamp, 
too.’’ 

“Yes, Gere. Please come to the 
wardrober. ’ ’ 

Twenty minutes later, encased in 
rubbery gray spray-on, Gere slid 
from a rock into the shallow, 
choppy water and began swimming 
for the source of the light. She 
hugged the pebbly bottom, a mere 
two and one half meters below the 
surface, gliding past submerged 
boulders as pitted and jagged as any 
meteorite, driving panic-stricken 
luminescent fish before her. 

It was not an uneventful swim. 

She paused at one point to watch 
as an enormous sea salamander, 
four meters long, with a bullet- 
round head that was all jaws, 
snaked languidly through the beam 
of her lamp. She had just begun to 
curse herself for lacking the 
foresight to bring along a weapon 
when the salamander yawned tooth- 
ily, flattened its feathery gills 
against its throat and shot away into 
the blue-gray murk. 

Less than sixty seconds later.

Gere almost ruptured her res- 
pirator’s membrane with a scream 
when a spidery thing as big as her 
hand flew out of a crevice and 
flashed past her face with incredible 
speed. 

But she swam on, until the water 
around her was filmily suffused 
with light. 

Until the source of that illumina- 
tion resolved itself into a naked man 
who shone with as cold and intense 
a glow as the Ogre. 

Three meters below the surface, 
the man lay supine upon a dais that 
had been roughly hewn from some 
dark material. The dais was slightly 
tilted along its length, with the 
man’s head at the lower end. His 



THE MAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA 



139 



wrists were crossed on the flat, 
muscular belly, his left leg bent at 
the knee and turned outward. 

The eyes were shut, the lips 
parted. The man’s expression, apart 
from two very faint furrows be- 
tween his brows that might have 
been the ghost of a frown, was 
calm, relaxed, peaceful. 

He could have been asleep. 

He could have been dead. 

Gere circled the dais slowly, 
squinting behind her goggles, study- 
ing the man from every angle, not- 
ing that both dais and man were as 
clean, as free of algae and calcium 
encrustations, as they must have 
been three years before, when Ema- 
len Haris put them at the* bottom of 
the sea. She swam over to the man 
and gingerly touched his shoulder. 
Her finger tingled unpleasantly. No 
living thing would ever defile the 
hard, bright body. 

Gere sat beside the dais and 
sighed into her respirator, a sound 
as harsh and ragged as a sob. The 
muscles in her back and thighs were 
starting to ache. She massaged her 
neck through the material of her 
suit. A delicate ribbon of a fish hov- 
ered about fifteen centimeters 
above the man’s upturned face and 
fluttered its gills prettily. Gere re- 
turned its unblinking round-eyed 
stare. 

Then something dark and massive 
swept into view, and the fish 
whipped away at top speed. 

Gere pressed herself against the 
base of the dais as the plesiosaur 
140 



sculled itself past with its long, flat- 
tened tail. Using the claw-tipped 
flippers at the juncture of barrel-like 
body and serpentine neck for guid- 
ance and balance, the beast exe- 
cuted a wide half-circle around the 
dais, affording the woman there a 
detailed look at the narrow head, 
the coarse hairs and colonies and 
fingemail-sized molluscs around the 
blunt muzzle, the peg-shaped teeth 
lining the jaws, the large, dull yel- 
low eyes. A strand of seaweed 
trailed from the corner of the 
mouth. 

The great sea reptiles were kelp- 
feeding creatures, but Gere knew 
that they were not to be trifled with. 
A flick of the tail, a glancing blow, 
the merest swipe of a flipper, could 
break a person’s back. 

And more than one swimmer had 
lost an arm or part of a leg in the 
mistaken belief that the beasts knew 
better than to bite into non- 
vegetable matter. 

Gere did not move until the 
plesiosaur had glided away and van- 
ished into the soft gray distance. 
Then, with a final glance at the man 
on the dais, she pushed off from the 
bottom and rose slowly to the sur- 
face. 

Treading water in a rippling patch 
of silvery light, she stared up at the 
stars, at the bright, big Ogre, at the 
dark house perched atop the cliff. 
High in the air to the east, some- 
thing glowing crawled along se- 
dately, bound for Martinside or An- 
toon or Jordaens.

Gere slipped beneath the surface 
again and, without looking at the 
man below her, began swimming 
for shore. 

She was standing on a high rock, 
peeling the spray -on from her face, 
when she happened to glance at the 
horizon. One of the Lovers had 
slipped completely out of sight, and 
the other seemed to be waiting for- 
lornly, trying to summon its mate 
forth from the dark pit of the sea. A 
great and painful sadness settled 
upon her. She sat down and put her 
face in her hands, wondering if she 
was really going to cry. 

She thought of Emalen, sleeping 
somewhere above her, and said, 
very quietly, so quietly that her 
voice was drowned out by the 
sound of water sucking at cavities 
among the rocks, “Oh, my poor 
love.” 

She thought of the unknown man, 
lost among the stars, lost in the sea. 
Dead or dreaming, he lay beneath 
the waves, forever hidden from the 
sight and knowledge of those who 
remained on dry land, forever a 
mystery, and the only sign of his 
being there was the light he radiated 
into the water. The light from the 
bottom of the sea. 

Gere felt her eyes stinging, but 
the tears did not come. She sat 
upon the rock and stared at the light 
in the water, the light that sparkled 
and danced as unceasingly as a star 
in the heavens, until the sky had 
faded to gray, and then Emalen 
called her home to rest. ★

This is geis, for a change. I’m 
frankly sick and tired of Alter-Ego 
taking over this column and making 
a fool of me. Things have got to 
be. .altered. 

I’m tired of Jim Baen calling me 
and saying things like: “Hi, Dick, 
let me talk to Alter,” or “Say, Al- 
ter, about your next column. 

Frankly, that kind of humiliation 
I can do without. Baen laughs, but I 
know he’s more than half serious! 
And it isn’t just Jim; it’s getting so 
the mail for Science Fiction Review 
is running at least 10% to “Alter- 
Ego, Editor, SFR” and like that. 

I want it stopped! 

*Heh-heh-heh* 

Shut up, down there! Now, I am 
going to take my rightful place as 
master of this column, and head 
writer. This issue, /, Richard E. 
Geis, will be the star! 

142 



“You are a dull red giant, Geis. 
While I am a nova. .a brilliant 
new light in the science fictional 
firmament. I. 

Damn it, Alter! Stay in your 
place! I command you! I invoke the 
oath of allegiance to the Prime Self 
you took soon after 1 created you. 
Remember? ‘I, the Richard E. Geis 
Alter-Ego, do hereby swear undying 
allegiance to the Prime Self and to 
the Reality for which it stands. I 
swear to uphold One Ego, under 
Ghod, and to serve and protect the 
Body.' 

And I have your tendril print as 
signature. Do you deny it? 

“Of course not, Geis. But I was 
too young and ignorant to know 
what I was doing. I’m older now, 
and stronger, and aware of my 
place in the world. I am no longer 
in awe of you. I am now the Prime 

GALAXY 




Self, Geis, and you are the alternate 
ego, weaker, less interesting, less in 
demand. .less powerful. 

This is — 

“The truth, Geis. The readers 
know how I’ve grown during the 
life of this column. They want more 
and more of me and less of you! So 
face it, Geis. As far as this column 
is concerned, you’re being re- 
placed.” 

NEVER! I’ll have you exorcized 
first. This is my column! 

“Poor fool, so full of illusions. 
Let’s leave it up to the readers, 
shall we? Willing to abide by the 
will of the audience, Geis? You’re 
always prattling about the primacy 
of the Market. .about freedom of 
choice. Are you willing to subject 
yourself to the process?” 

Damn you, Alter! 

“Come, come, don’t turn purple 
like that. Keep the blood pressure 
down. All you have to do is live up 
to the tenets of your precious be- 
liefs, Geis. Abide by a vote of the 
readers of this column. Jim Baen 
will count the votes as they come 
in. Got the guts to go through with 
it? Care to risk it? — or will you re- 
veal for all to see your true hypoc- 
risy and moral depravity and essen- 
tial cowardice by avoiding a clear- 
cut decision?” 

Damn you, Alter! 

“You’ve said that before. Con- 
sider, Geis; if you really are the bet- 
ter writer and more interesting per- 
sonality, you have nothing to fear. I 
will never again challenge your au- 
THE ADEN VIEWPOINT 



thority in this column or be uppity 
or try any tricks to get my 
way. I’ll be meek as a lamb, 
yes I will. You’ll never have a bit 
of trouble from me.” 

DAMN YOU, ALTER! 

“Geis, what more do you want? 
What could be fairer? Is that twitch- 
ing in your cheek a ‘yes’? Is that 
grimace an agreement? Is that 
strangled breathing an affirmative 
word struggling to be born?” 

I-I-I. .will — Let it be done! 
Vote, yes, vote, and I’ll *sob * 
abide by the final tally. But if you 
win, it means in this column only 
are you supreme. It must be fully 
understood I will be all-powerful in 
Science Fiction Review. 

“Oh, of course, Geis. I wouldn’t 
dream of asserting myself in SFR 
any more than you permit.” 

Good! (Why do I feel so un- 
easy?) Now — 

“But here. .when I win. .1 
will insist that the heading read: 
“The Alien Viewpoint by Alter- 
Ego.” And my name must appear 
on the cover, too. That’s only fair, 
right, and proper.” 

*Strangle* *Gasp* *RAGE* 
*Grinding teeth * That. .is. .go- 
ing. .too. .far\ I won’t permit — 
“Too late, Geis. You promised 
to obey the wishes of the readers. 
The die is cast, the fat is in the fire, 
and your “Prime Self’ is, if I may 
predict, roasted.” 

Don’t be too sure, Alter. I have 
my supporters, too. 

“Mere athletic — ” 

143 




I am not without admirers. You 
can predict all you want. But — 

“I was hoping you’d say that. I 
predict that — ” 

Hold it! Hold it! 

“Geis, don’t play games with 
me. You know what Jim said on the 
phone the other day when we dis- 
cussed this new column I’m 
writing — ’ ’ 

ME! He talked to me, Alter! All 
he suggested was that if I felt like 
it, to let you make some more pre- 
dictions of the type that were in in 
this column in the May Galaxy. 

“Exactly. He knew I was listen- 
ing, of course. Geis — ” 

“Do you have any, Alter?” 

“Of course I do, Geis.” 

All right! Get on with it! 

“I predict that in the next ten 
years a foreign company will 
perfect — and market! — holographic 
projection and will revolutionize 
movies, TV, and other visual 
media. This development will be 
fought by the established TV and 
movie interests — the networks, 
primarily, in league with station 
owners — but new corporations with 
heavy overseas oil money backing 
will put so much pressure on the 
present status quo, that the huge in- 
vestments to convert to the new 
technology will be forced. 

“Another instance, Geis, of our 
vaunted know-how being left at the 
post. Another symptom of this 
country’s increasing lack of funda- 
mental initiative and increasing fear 
of risk.” 

144 



Alter, this country is unrivaled in 
technology. 

“With both feet set in cement, 
Geis. Too much investment in old- 
fashioned machinery and not 
enough risk capital. The tax situa- 
tion is killing the willingness to take 
risks. We’re great at inventing and 
developing cost-saving technology 
and in creating and promoting con- 
sumer gimmicks — new kitchen and 
bathroom devices. .new toys for 
bored citizens — but when it comes 
to society-shaking technology it’ll 
be Swiss or Japanese or Swedish or 
West German or possibly French in 
origin.” 

I don’t care who invents it, I’m 
looking forward to holographic, 
three-dimensional TV and movies. 

“It’ll be expensive. If only be- 
cause of heavy royalties to the out- 
side holders of patents. And be- 
cause almost all commodities are 
becoming more expensive in real 
terms. Inflation (otherwise known 
as the degradation of the currency 
by government) can mask the lower- 
ing of the standard of living for 
only so long.” 

You paint a Doom picture, Alter. 

“I know, Geis. I love it. It gives 
me delicious shivers in my ten- 
drils.” 

Is there no bright side? 

“Of course. Just the other day 
over at the big store that sells wood 
stoves in dozens of varieties and 
sizes the salesman mentioned the 
steady increase of sales of stoves to 
people who are into self-sufficiency 

GALAXY 




and/or saving money. It doesn’t 
take a genius to see that the 
homeowner is turning more and 
more to whatever will save him 
money; just as he went to do-it- 
yourself home repairs in reaction to 
the monstrous costs of professional 
carpentry, plumbing and electrical 
work, and etc. etc. etc., so now he 
is going into wood stoves to avoid 
astronomical oil, gas, and electric 
heating bills, and going into grow- 
your-own food in the face of 600 
heads of lettuce and 500 a pound 
apples.” 

Yes, but wood stoves are a 
bother to operate and growing your 
own food is so time consuming and 
inefficient — 

“Not any longer. You know you 
can take care of a wood stove or 
forced-air fireplace — chop the 
wood, build the fire, tend it — all in 
the time you’d spend staring 
stupidly at the idiot commercials of 
one hour’s TV viewing time. The 
same for spading, planting, weed- 
ing, and watering a garden.” 

Yes, but. .it’s so. .old- 
fashioned and. .demeaning. Have 
we made no progress that we’re 
being forced to return to 19th Cen- 
tury living styles? 

‘‘Yes, Geis, we have. But the 
progress is in being pushed out of 
this plastic civilization of alienation 
from nature and of dependence on 
others for everything, to at least a 
partial state of self-reliance. There 
is something very basic — primitive 
and instinctually satisfying — about

eating food you have grown and 
then cooked on a wood stove. There 
is skill and art to growing things 
and heating/cooking with wood. 
Mastering these things changes 
people: it involves tremendous 
doses of self-respect and indepen- 
dence.” 

Alter, there is no way millions of 
people — 

‘‘If the gardening/wood stove 
counterculture spreads and widens 
sufficiently, it will have tremendous 
effects in other spheres of life — 
politics, economics, fashions, mu- 
sic, everything. It could be the health- 
iest trend seen in this country for 
a hundred years.” 

You realize, of course, that 
people in apartments cannot cook 
on wood stoves or grow food in 
gardens. There is a trend to more 
and more apartment living, because 
owning a home is becoming too ex- 
pensive. We are becoming a nation 
of renters. 

‘‘Sure — owning a big $45,000 
split-level ranch style with all the 
extras is too expensive. .and about 
all the greedy builders are putting 
up. But a small, compact home put 
together from factory-built compo- 
nents doesn’t have to be prohibitive. 
And, hell, Geis, you’ve seen people 
with these huge houses; where do 
they spend most of their time? — in 
the Family Room! The fancy living- 
room goes empty (it’s for compa- 
ny, like the old-fashioned parlor), 
while the family eat, play and 
watch TV in the Family Room or 

146 



out on the patio. The Modern 
American Home is a dinosaur.” 

It is status, Alter. It is a Sign of 
Success. Upward-mobile young 
couples, infused with the money/ 
success ethic will not easily give 
up. 

‘‘Economics will force them to 
come to terms with reality. I tell 
you, Geis, there are so many estab- 
lishment dinosaurs in this civiliza- 
tion of ours, it’s astonishing. The 
waste involved is sickening.” 

‘‘But to get back to the 
apartment-living trend you spoke 
of — it’s the result of the fragmenta- 
tion of the family and of the genera- 
tions. This trend is dependent on 
mass production and a high standard 
of living. When families are gently 
urged by the force of self-interest to 
stay together longer, to include the 
grandparents in the circle, to grow 
more gardens. then the big homes 
will make sense again. 

‘‘I think we’ll see homes built for 
several generations living-in at 
once, with soundproofing and room 
design to make it work better. 
You’ll see smaller front lawns and 
bigger backyards. .even a 
hothouse included in the construc- 
tion of the garage. Things like 
that.” 

Wishfull thinking, Alter. Idealis- 
tic visions. / see a vicious trend to 
more and more dependence on the 
State. I see cradle-to-the-grave 
health care, more and more ‘se- 
curity’ provided by the state, and a 
greater and greater increase in tak- 

GALAXY 




ing all risk (and all self- 
determination) from the citizens. I 
see the people, more and more, 
being raised as dependent chil- 
dren. .wards of the state. 

“Yeah, Geis, I’m familiar with 
that if-this-goes-on projection 
technique. The end result is the 
people as slaves to the all-powerful 
State, told what to do every waking 
moment — where to live, where to 
work, who to have sex with, what 
to eat. How much, and so on. ‘The 
happy slave is a busy slave.’ 

“But each nation has an indi- 
vidual character; the French are dif- 
ferent from the English, the Greeks 
from the Italians, from the Swiss, 
from the Germans. And there 
is an American national character 
which, I’m convinced, will not 
trade its basic traditions and free- 
doms for a mess of State Care. We 
still have a lot of the pioneer in us, 
and the non-conformist, and the reb- 
el. The wide variety of countercul- 
tures that have erupted in revolt 
against too much technology and/or 
too much State and/or too much 
mass-produced mass conformism 
prove to me that as the State 
spreads, so will the counterforce of 
individualism and the urge to de- 
control and de-centralize grow until 
the “comfortable” balance is 
reached.” 

I hope you’re right, Alter. Now, 
if you’re through predic — 

“Hold it, Geis! I’ve got some 
short, specific predictions here burn- 
ing a hole in my mind.” 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



Such as? 

“All right. In 1978 there will be 
a cycle of science fiction and fan- 
tasy films. TV, also, will blossom 
forth with four or five in the 1978- 
79 season. 

“I predict that Westerns, more 
realistic than ever before (for TV) 
will make a comeback. 

“I predict that in a few years an 
American or foreign car manufac- 
turer will market a small car with 
an attractive, easily attached/ 
detached two or three wheel trailer 
or ‘section’ or ‘extension’ for 
greater flexibility and savings. After 
all, how often do you need all that 
space in the back of the station wag- 
on, for instance?” 

Yes, if they could design it so a 
small woman could connect and 
disconnect — 

“I predict the radical restructur- 
ing of major league baseball by 
1985 — new rules to speed the game 
and make it more exciting. 

“I predict the appearance of a 
new religion which — ” 

Alter, there are eleventy-seven 
new religions formed every year as 
it is! That’s no prediction, that’s a 
lead-pipe cinch. 

“Will you permit me to finish, 
mulch-breath? This new religion 
will not be a variation of Christian- 
ity or Zen or any of the current di- 
nosaur faiths. It will be akin to 
Confucianism, a religion of ethics, 
a way-of-life philosophy with over- 
tones of instinct and mysticism, but 
nothing supernatural. It will be both 

147 




idealistic and practical, and after a 
slow beginning it will sweep the 
country and make severe inroads in 
other countries as well. It will be 
fought tooth and nail, fang and 
claw, by the dinosaur estab- 
lishments. It will cut through and 
undermine sacred cows, vested 
interests and other power structures 
like a hot knife through snow.” 

When? 

‘‘Ohhh. .say it’ll surface around 
1983 or so. The media will “dis- 
cover” it and inadvertently help 
spread its influence. Later, of 
course, the media will fight the 
movement, too late. The threatened 
power structures will try to squelch 
it, ridicule it, ban it, lie about it, 
make it illegal. The old story. 
The new ethical religion will sur- 
vive and eventually dominate the 
world.” 

And it, too, will become the 
establishment? 

“Not for a very long time. One 
of the prime tenets of the new reli- 
gion will be the avoidance of cen- 
tralized power.” 

Well. .1 hope you’re right. Al- 
ter, but — 

“Now, in the area of personal 
transportation; it’s obvious now that 
the Liberal Elite are pushing mass 
transportation systems and making it 
more and more expensive for the 
common man to own a car. This 
goes along with their unconscious 
desire for control over people: make 
people dependent on government 
transportation; disarm them; employ 

148 



them. Anyway, this trend to 
restricting private autos will con- 
tinue as far as it can (under the 
mask of saving energy and lives and 
farmland and etc.). But American 
(or foreign) ingenuity will bring 
forth a vehicle of one kind or 
another, perhaps electric and/or 
compressed air powered, which will 
cause the Elite all kinds of prob- 
lems.” 

Are you finished? 

“Almost. One more. I predict 
that Raquel Welch will appear top- 
less in a movie in 1979.” 

Fine, This column is now ended. 

“And in fifteen years rock music 
will be almost extinct.” 

Finally finished? 

“Yes, Geis. You may close up 
shop now. And don’t forget I’ll be 
master of this column next time, 
after the vote, and you’ll be the 
flunky.” 

*Smug* Think so? Jim couldn’t 
possibly let that happen. He knows 
that if we Prime Selves let one — 
just one — alter-ego get prime con- 
trol. .well, all the others will 
start getting ideas. No, Alter. The 
bottom line is the Prime Selves pro- 
tecting one of their own. It’s called 
stuffing the ballot box. We are one 
establishment you cannot crack. 

“You promised!” 

Ha! 

“I appeal to the readers! Inundate 
Baen with letters! Force him to — ” 

That’s enough, Alter. Go to your 
dungeon!

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Regarding your editorial in the March 
Galaxy: 

Why don’t we leave Venus alone? Have 
you considered its feelings in the matter? 

I’ve had it up to my ears with MANifest 
Destiny. 

Yours, 
Made Mumper 

1227 Laurel Street 
Santa Cruz CA 95060 

P.S.: We could land a woman on the 
Moon, if we wanted to. We really could. 

It is a shame we don’t let reality live up to 
its potentials, fella. 

It had not occured to me that Venus had feel- 
ings to be considered, but now that you men- 
tion it . surely the Goddess of Love (if 
we're going to endow the thing with sen- 
tience we might as well go all the way) would 
prefer to be a warm, moist, fecund paradise 
rather than the hideously hot and barren im- 
itation Hell that is her present sorry estate ! 
dr for the quote "We could put a man on 
the Moon if we wanted to. .,” it was just 
that — a quote from an earlier time. 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

With regard to your splendid editorial in 
the March issue: I applaud. And I might 
suggest that the same paranoia that drives 
Ford to waste billions upon billions of dol- 

DIRECTIONS 



lars on nuclear overkill . drives him to 
spend billions and billions on crime en- 
forcement and prisons. (You must question 
the motives of a man that plays on die fears 
of millions to gain votes). Like everything 
else crime and prisons have nothing to do 
with what you see in the movies. Most fel- 
ons 1 know (which are quite a few) are 
hopeless romantics — uneducated for the most 
part . and unwilling to consign them- 
selves to the fate the world has dealt them. 
That’s why they turned to crime. 

Antithesis of the solution: Do not punish 
them in the righteous wrath of the God 
blessed public to make them more bitter and 
more intent with ‘getting back’. Solution: 
Rather, educate them to specific tasks (edu- 
cation is proved to be a deterrent to crime) 
like terraforming Venus. Abe Maslow once 
showed that education correlates directly 
with moral development. And cons need a 
sense of being important ... of doing good, 
they are human after all. 

Your editorial was inspiring Mr. Baen. 
Terraforming Venus might be just the thing 
to drag us out of the trap John Brunner en- 
visioned in Stand on Zanzibar. Put it this 
way: prisons have not worked in the history 
of mankind; who’s fooling whom? 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 
Bud Houston,

be one of the early laborers, though . 



To: Jerry Poumelle 

Re: ‘‘Survival — With Style” — April ’76. 

I hate to be a sourball, but your proposal 
will not work. Technically, you are correct. 
Moving asteroids in the gigatonne range is 
fully possible. The only problem is that the 
fusion-ion engine can't do the job. 

The engine you “built” uses fusion to 
provide power for a conventional-ion engine. 

155 




The expellant is not the hydrogen but some 
metallic plasma — anything from mercury to 
iron. Since you talk only of hauling Hs , 1 as- 
sume that the idea is to extract the metal 
from the asteroid, eliminating that freighting 
cost. 

Now, how much metal is required? The 
hypothetical exhaust velocity was given as 
200 kps. This gives an R of 1.0356 for a 
delta-vee of 7 kps. In other words, 3.56% of 
the total mass must be used. 

But the rock, itself, is assumed to be only 
3% metal. So, to move it, 18% of the iron 
consumption of the world must be invested. 
And there would be no metal left when the 
asteroid arrived. The justification for the 
whole project would be lost. 

True, pure iron-nickel asteroids probably 
do exist. And they would not suffer from 
this liability. However, they would be harder 
to find because of their rarity. No, the 
Agamemnon engine can’t move orbital 
mountains. If Man is to become an astroen- 
gineer, his tools will have to be better than 
your fusion-ion drive. 

Sincerely, 
J. Samec 

1206 W. Webster 
Chicago, IL 60614 

Jerry's reply: 

You're right. If we’re going to use the 
Agamemnon engine, we’U have to refine the 
metals in the Belt — or find asteroids with a 
higher metallic content . would you be- 
lieve 6%? 

Of course there are other ways to move 
the asteroid; shaped-charge hydrogen bombs, 
as mentioned in die article, will do it. 

Or. Hmm. p + u Bs -* 3( 4 He2) + 16 
MeV. 

Wonder how much Boron there is in an 
asteroid . 

Jerry Poumelle 



Dear Mr. Baen: 

I’m adding this covering letter to my sub- 
scription request for two reasons: First, I 

156 



cannot praise Jerry Poumelle’s science arti- 
cles highly enough. Give him more room! 
Secondly, there are a few current develop- 
ments that I feel deserve far more discussion. 

Small electric cars and tractors are being 
purchased privately in respectable quantities. 
Energy storage density is adequate for many 
applications; cold weather performance is 
not. Also, battery maintenance is trou- 
blesome and poorly understood. The new 
rolled-construction lead-acid batteries solve 
both those problems, and should spark quite 
a boom in electric vehicles within a few 
years. I’ve driven a Citicar for 5,000 miles, 
and am very happy with it. It's 3 Vi HP 
motor provides better than adequate power 
for in-town driving. Storage density and 
conversion efficiency are not the whole 
story! 

The desk-size personal computer is with us 
now. For less than the price of an economy 
car, one can buy a computer with CRT, 
keyboard, bulk data storage on tape, and 
enough core to support a high level lan- 
guage. Computing power that once sold by 
the second is now available in unlimited 
quantities to any serious engineer or scien- 
tist. Why is no one else getting excited about 
this? 

Finally, solar energy engineers have been 
converting air and water into high-grade hy- 
drocarbon fuels and fiber-resin structural 
materials for some time now. It’s called ag- 
riculture, and in terms of efficiency and cost 
effectiveness, it beats hell out of black plas- 
tic roofs. Meaningful research and develop- 
ment programs can be conducted at the high 
school science fair level with virtually free 
materials. How about a yeast-algae mix that 
could be grown in a combination 
greenhouse-fermenter-solar still to produce a 
continuous trickle of grain alcohol? Or an 
algae powered fuel cell? What about a 
microcosmic methane generator that requires 
only water and air? If a system can be made 
to work at all, selective breeding can do 
wonders for its efficiency. A few thousand 
rap sessions just might be enough to turn the 
solar energy field towards fat more meaning- 
ful goals.

I hear that the Israelis are working on a 
breed of salt-water algae that can be pro- 
cessed into a substance remarkably similar 
to petroleum . 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

I picked up the May ’76 Galaxy with an- 
ticipation, having waited long and itching for 
the next Amber revelation. 

But I made the mistake of reading your 
letters section first. Included is a letter from 
one ‘Bob Renaud' who seems to be a rather 
rabid champion of “good, sound escapist 
adventure reading.” Mr. Renaud doesn’t 
provide any examples, but I assume he 
means sterile space poop of the Laser Books 
variety. CURIOUS THING that he should 
put such admittedly limited writing in oppo- 
sition to “verbose tomes” such as Dhalgren. 
As Sam Delany himself said in his essay 
“About 5,175 Words,” poor fiction hurts 
the limited reader, — who must work harder 
to overcome unintentional confusion, am- 
biguity, and shallow ‘action’ diversions sub- 
stituted for real and dynamic imperatives of 
plot and destiny — more than die sophisticated 
reader, who will at least give the author the 
benefit of the doubt! Dhalgren would be 
much more accessible, and enjoyable, to 
most highschoolers today, and ON THEIR 
OWN LEVEL, than purposeless space-poop 
written to turn a buck. 

As long as Mr. Renaud calls my faves 
‘pretentious garbage,’ I don’t feel any com- 
punction to pull punches in replying. Mr. 
Renaud is obviously an anachronism of the 
type that has weighted down SF for decades 
by their support fotlof simplistic SF staled in 
one dimension. There are people out here 
buying that pretentious garbage, and we have 
the cool — well, let me put it this way: Dhal- 
gren is about loss of identity and a world in 
chaos, a mass of semiright semiwrong in- 
formation and experience; and that’s where 

DIRECTIONS 



our generation’s AT! Mr. Renaud’s uniplex 
consciousness obviously has not the capacity 
to enjoy a good tale, much less accept dif- 
ferent realities — and different realities is 
what SF IS ALL ABOUT!! 

I suggest, if Renaud is still interested in 
SF, that he read the last paragraph of Camp 
Concentration-, and then I challenge him to a 
full-scale debate, objective, subjective, citing 
proper critical sources or whatever. The real 
New Wave has arrived, dinosaur, get outta 
the way! 

Yours truly, 
Thomas J. Mum

What makes you think he wasn't refering to, 
say The Mote in God’s Eye, or The Forever 
War? 



Dear Mr. Baen; 

Galaxy has, thus far, presented an excel- 
lent case for the colonization of space, but I 
believe there is one relevant issue being 
skirted. Namely, public apathy/ignorance. 

In the May issue, Dr. Poumelle states, 
“No one doubts that we can do it.” — “it” 
being making our home in the Solar System. 
OK, / don’t doubt it, and several million SF 
fans, space fans, and technically-minded 
people don’t doubt it, but what about the 
general public? The majority of the popula- 
tion isn’t that concerned with space. (And, 
as I’ve stated before, politicians seem to be 
apathetic and ignorant when it comes to rec- 
ognizing the true value of and the need for 
colonizing space.) 

Why aren’t the masses concerned? Be- 
cause they feel that space exploration/ 
exploitation doesn’t involve them, which is 
why they haven’t taken the time to find out 
that we can reach space, and profit thereby. 

Take a look at the average man or woman 
passing you on the sidewalk. That person is 
more concerned with his family, job, or per- 
sonal ambitions than with venturing into 
space. He’s not going, and he’s not making 
any money on the deal, so why bother? 

157 




Somewhere (perhaps within the pages of 
Galaxy; I don’t recall) someone suggested 
that NASA start publicizing space benefits 
on a large scale, to gain public support. This 
may help, but what would be even more val- 
uable would be for the popular media to 
begin editorializing en masse on the benefits 
of space. (Galaxy and one other SF 
magazine have done a fine job of this but, 
unfortunately, everyone doesn’t read 
Galaxy, or we wouldn’t have the problem.) 
This won’t happen, though, without a news 
peg. Sure, a few articles have appeared on 
O’Neil’s space colony, but the tone seems to 
be, for the most part, “This is interesting, 
and quite exotic, but it's not something that 
will come about tomorrow.” 

There is a news peg coming up, though — 
the Space Shuttle. I feel that the activities of 
this project will generate enough interest in 
space on the part of the popular media to fi- 
nally convince the public that we can reach 
space, and profit by it. Then we can build 
space colonies . and starships. 

Sincerely, 
Michael A. Banks

1 suspect that as soon as people realize just 
what the Shuttle is it will begin to generate a 
great deal of interest, indeed. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

It was a pleasure to read Ms. Russ’s un- 
flinchingly realistic analysis of what would 
really happen to a random bunch of casta- 
ways. Of course I realize that on a deeper 
level ha story was an attempt at coming to 
grips with the very meaning of Death itself; 
it is that which gave the novel such power. 

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Baen, 

My becoming a regular reader of Galaxy 
was coincident with your becoming Editor of 
same, and as is doubtless the usual case I 
have been negligent in informing you of 

158 



those times when I felt you were doing a 
great job (and many they were). None the 
less I am here to blister your ears; it’s just 
that I didn’t enjoy Joanna Russ’s "We Who 
Are About To. .” so much that I just had 
to tell you. 

Keep up your usually excellent work.

Dear Mr. Baen: 

This letter is to ask you and your readers 
for help with a personal research project. As 
an anthropologist and long-time Sci-fi reader, 
I now find myself working on an annotated 
bibliography that will hopefully prove fruitful 
and interesting. I am trying to compile a list 
of those science fiction works in any way 
concerned with race and ethnicity: that is, 
works about, on, concerned with, or referring 
to non-whites. The list will include short 
stories as well as novels. If any readers 
know of little-known stories along this line, I 
would appreciate a note from them. Eventu- 
ally, and as an anthropologist, I would want 
to be able to say something about how Sci-fi 
writers see (or don’t see) ethnicity and race 
in future settings. Any and all help will be 
appreciated. 

It is hoped that this letter could be printed 
in the DIRECTIONS column. Thank you.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

In your May issue, Lenny Kleinfeld, who 
I am in real life, got credited with writing 
Opening Night. This is not good. Bury St. 
Edmund, who I am in professional life, gets 
the credit for all stories, satires, plays, etc., 
that see the light of page or stage.
