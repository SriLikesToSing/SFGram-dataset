you’re chat man. here’s someching that will 
interesc you. 

Noc a magic formula — noc a gec-rich-quick 
scheme — but someching more subsunciai. more 
practical. 

Of course, you need someching more than just 
the desire to be an accouncam. You've got to pay 
the pricc^be willing to study earncsrly, thoroughly. 

Still, wouldn't it be worth your while to sacri* 
hce some of your leisure in favor of interesting 
home study — over a comparatively brief period.-' 
Always provided that the rewards were good — a 
salary of $4,000 to $10,000:' 

An accountant's duties are interesting, varied 
and of real worth to his employers. He has

Veil, don't be too sure. Very possibly they can be! 

Why noc, tike so many before you. investigate 
LaSalle's modern Problem Method of training for 
an accountancy, position? 

Just suppose you were permitted to work in a 
large accounting house under the personal super- 
vision of an expert accountant. Suppose, with his 
aid. you studied accounting principles and solved 
problems day by day— easy ones at first— then 
more ditficulc ones. If you could do this — and 
could turn to him for advice as the problems be- 
came complex— soon you'd master them all. 

That’s the training you follow in principle un- 
der the LaSalle Problem Method. 

You cover accountancy from the basic Prin- 
ciples right up through Accountancy Systems arid 
Income Tax Procedure. Then you add C. P. A. 
Training and prepare for the C. P. iv examina- 
tions. 

As you go along, you absorb the principles of 
Audicifig, Cose Accoimtiag* Business Law, Sea-

Fi nance. 

Your progress is as speedy as you care to make 
it — depending on your own eagerness to learn 
and the time you spend in study. 

Will recognition come? The only answer, as 
you know, is that success dna come to the man 
who is really trained. It's possible your employers 
will notice your improvement in a very few weeks 
or months. Indeed, many LaSalle graduates have 
paid for tlicir training— with increased earnings 
—before they have completed it! For accountants, 
who are triined in organization and management, 
are the executives of the future.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

SINCE THE first trip into space — 
science fiction-wise, of course — au- 
thors and experts have conceived 
a multitude of shapes for the space 
ship. They have been conical, egg- 
shaped, tubular, spherical and cubi- 
cle, while the most popular con- 
ception has been that of a rocket, 
or torpedoc, with fins of varying 
size and design. In the March, 
1953, issue of The Sooner Maga- 
zine, published at the University of 
Oklahoma, there appeared an arti- 
cle entitled “The Sky’s No Limit’’, 
by Dwight V. Swain, professor' of 
journalism and a former science 
fiction writer, in which the space 
ship is envisioned as follows: 

“A sphere of dully gleaming 
metal some fifty feet in diameter, 
it rests on stubby, retractable legs 
. Carriers speed to and fro from 
refrigerated warehouses, carrying 
cargo to the conveyor lift built into 
the ship’s base . 



The cargo is aboard — 

. the dozen-odd crewmen at 
their stations, the hatches sealed. 
The sphere floats for a moment, 
barely off the ground, while the 
stubby stabilizing legs retract. Then, 
slowly at first (in order to avoid 
the heat of atmospheric friction), 
it soars into the sky. No one knows 
for sure how fast it can go. In 
theory, gravity acts instantaneously, 
and even the electro-magnetic 
waves that carry power travel at up 
to 186,000 miles per second . .’’ 

THIS quotation is part of an ex- 
cerpt from Mr. Swain’s article 
which we ran in the September, 
1953, issue of IF, and we waited 
almost a year before we got a letter 
which came out emphatically in 
favor of the sphere. Here it is — 
from Mr. L. W. Walton, of Bucks, 
England, who read it in the Eng- 
lish edition of IF. 

Sir: 

It is a pity that most science fic- 
tion writers cannot get away from 
the V2 idea, a most unsuitable form 
of space ship not likely ever to be of 
practical use in space travel. From 
considerations of every aspect, seri- 
ous space travel is not likely to be 
achieved until gravity is understood 
and when nuclear energy is avail- 
able in controllable amounts from 
light-weight, compact apparatus. 

The super-streamlined, tail- 
finned, pusher-rocket driven space 
ship (V2 kind) cannot ever be a 
practical solution of space travel. 
It is thoroughly unsafe in take off 
and more so in landing because it 
is nose heavy and therefore “ground 
seeking”; the idea of landing by 



standing on its jets is scaring, vio- 
lent unstable wobbles could not be 
avoided. It would be much better 
to have not less than three tractor 
rockets instead of trail rockets, fins 
with their weight and atmospheric 
drag could then be discarded. The 
center of thrust in front of or at the 
center of gravity is much better 
than behind the latter. But the 
thing that kills the rocket as a 
means of space travel is the formid- 
able load of jettisonable matter that 
must be carried whatever the 
source of energy may be, even if it 
is atomic. 

The spherical form of space ship 
has a higher strength-weight ratio 
and relative volumetric capacity 
than a torpedo form, and apart 
from the lowest levels of the atmos- 
phere, say about 20 miles, it is not 
at any disadvantage. In fact, with- 
in that 20 miles velocity must be 
low so streamlining has no real ad- 
vantage. 

In landing, the spherical form is 
greatly superior, whilst the torpedo 
form is positively dangerous. The 
spherical form can take off from 
and land in water — the torpedo 
form could not; it could also berth 
in and take off from mud or dust, 
snow or frozen gases, in all cases 
with perfect stability. 

Swain, in the article referred to 
. speaks of a “contragravitation- 
al device” and though an oar is 
such a device it is obvious that he 
means some device which directly 
counteracts gravity shields after H. 
G. Wells. I agree with Swain on 
this point, and that is after some 
42 years study of the problems of 
space travel. 

On the other hand, Swain’s 



“wireless power transmission” and 
“transmutational duplicator” can 
be dismissed as outside of practical 
science, i.e., they are pure fantasy. 
Nuclear energy is apparently the 
only solution for space ships . 
regeneration of oxygen, water, car- 
bohydrates, proteins, vitamins and 
body minerals, though most de- 
sirable, is not absolutely necessary 
but given nuclear energy such re- 
generation is a reasonable scientific 
probability. 

With nuclear cnergx' and regen- 
eration as above described and 
some means of directly distorting 
a gravitational field, space travel 
would not only be a practical but 
also a coininerclal success — for the 
amount and weight of fuel and sup- 
plies of air, water and food required 
would be vers' small and possible 
payload high. 

It is refreshing to find a science 
fiction writer having some scientific 
logic, as Swain has, and science fic- 
tion would be much more enter- 
taining if fantasy was barred. In 
present science fiction it is irritating 
to bump into scientific absurdities 
such as time travel, hyperdrive, 
space warps, telepaths, etc., etc. 

— Yours faithfully 
L. W. Walton 

I disagree w'ith Mr. Walton 
when he says time travel or tele- 
pathy is a scientific absurdity, but 
I do agree with him in regard to 
his ideas on space travel. Also, let’s 
not forget that everything we know 
today rested in our imagination be- 
fore it ever got to the drawing 
board. And isn’t imagination itself 
real? . Anyhow, what do you 
think? — ^jlq

THE 

TEST COLONY 



Benson did his best to keep his colony from going native, 
but what can you do when the Natives have a rare 
human intelligence and know all about the facts of life? 



BY WINSTON MARKS 



I T WAS the afternoon of our 
arrival. Our fellow members of 
the “test colony” were back in the 
clearing at the edge of the lake, 
getting their ground-legs and drink- 
ing in the sweet, clean air of Sirius 
XXII. I was strolling along the 
strip of sandy beach with Phillip 
Benson, leader of our group, sniff- 
ing the spicy perfume of the forest 
that crowded within twenty feet 
of the water’s edge. 

Half a billion miles overhead, 
Sirius shone with an artificially 
white glow. Somewhere on the ho- 
rizdn. Earth lay, an invisible, remote 
speck of dust we had forsaken 24 
dreary, claustrophobic months ago. 
The trip had taken its toll from 



all of us, even tough-minded Phil 
Benson. We both found it difficult 
to relax and enjoy the invigorating, 
oxygen-rich air and the balmy cli- 
mate. A.S official recorder, I was 
trying to think of words suitable 
to capture the magnificence, the 
sheer loveliness of the planet which 
would be our home for at least 
four years, perhaps forever. 

Each absorbed in his own 
thoughts, Benson and I were some 
500 yards from the clearing when 
he stopped me with a hand on my 
arm. ‘'Who is that?” he demanded. 

Up the beach where he pwinted, 
two naked forms emerged from the 
calm waters. They skipped across 
the sand and began rolling together

playfully in the soft grasses at the 
forest’s edge. Even at this distance 
they were visibly male and female. 

“I can’t make them out,” 1 said. 
My only thought was that one of 
the young coii|)l<-s liatl swum down 
ahead of us and was enjoying the 
first privacy attain.ible in two years. 

Benson’s eyes were sharper. 
“Sam, they — they look like—” 

Our voices must have reached 
them, for they sprang apart and 
rose to their feet facing us. 

“Like youngsters,” I supplied. 

“We have no kids with us,” Ben- 
son reminded me. He began to 
move forward, slowly, as though 
stalking a wild animal. 

“Wait, Phil,” I said. “The planet 
is uninhabited. They can’t be — ” 

He continued shuffling ahead, 
and I followed. Within 20 paces 
I knew he was right. Whoever they 
were they hadn’t come with us! 

Benson stopped so quickly I 
bumped into him. “Look, Sam! 
Their hands and feet! Four digits 
and — no thumbs!” 

I could now make out the details. 
The two forms were not quite hu- 
man. The toes were long and pre- 
hensile. The fingers, too, were 
exceptionally long, appearing to 
have an extra joint, but as Benson 
mentioned, there was no opposing 
thumb. 

They stood well apart now, the 
female seeking no protection from 
the male. Curiosity was written in 
their faces, and when we stopped 
advancing they began edging for- 
ward until they were only five yards 
away. 

Their outlines, instead of becom- 
ing clearer, had fuzzed up more as 
they approached. Now it was evi- 
dent that their bodies were lightly 

8 



covered with a silky hair, some two 
or three inches long. It had al- 
ready dried out in the warm sun 
and was standing out away from 
their skins like golden haloes. 

They stood well under five feet 
tall, and in every detail, except the 
body hair and digits, appeared to 
be miniature adults, complete with 
navels. 

Even in the midst of the shock of 
surprise, I was taken by their re- 
markable beauty. “They’re true 
mammals!” I exclaimed. 

“Without a doubt,” Benson said, 
eyeing tlie full contours of the litlie 
little female. Her pink flesh tones 
were a full shade lighter than those 
of the male. Both had well-spaced 
eyes under broad foreheads. Their 
fine features were drawn into fear- 
less, half-quizzical, half-good-na- 
tured exprc-ssions of deep interest. 
They sto^ relaxed as if waiting for 
a parley to begin. 

“This,” said Benson, “is one hell 
of a note!” 

They cocked their heads at the 
sound like robins. I said, “Why? 
They don’t appear very vicious to 
me.” 

“Neither does man,” Benson re- 
plied. “It’s his brain that makes 
him deadly. Look at those skulls, 
the car placement, the eyes and 
forehead. If I know my skull for- 
mations, I think man has met his 
intellectual equal at last — maybe, 
even, his superior.” 

“What makes you think they may 
have sujxrrior minds?” As a psy- 
chologist I felt Benson was jump- 
ing to a pretty quick conclusion. 

“The atmosphere. Forty percent 
oxygen. Invariably, on other plan- 
ets, that has meant higher meta- 
bolisms in the fauna. In a humanoid 

WINSTON AAARKS 




animal that strongly implies high 
mental as well as physical activity. 

As if to prove his point, the two 
little creatures tired of the one-sided 
interview, bent slightly at the knees 
and leaped at a forty-five degree 
angle high into the tree branches. 
The female caught the first limb 
with her long fingers and swung 
out of sight into the foliage. The 
male hung by his long toes for a 
moment, regarding us with an in- 
verted impish expression, then he, 
too, vanished. 

I grunted with disap(x>intment. 
Benson said, “Don’t worry, they’ll 
be back. Soon enough.” 

A S WE returned to the clearing 
Jane Btmson and Susan, my 
wife, came to meet us. Although 
both brunettes rated high in femi- 
nine charms among the forty wom- 
en of our group, somehow they ap- 
peared a little ungainly and un- 
commonly tall against my mental 
image of the little ptcople we had 
just left. sTheir faces were pale 
from the long intennent in the ship, 
and bright spots of sunburn on 
cheekbones and forehead gave them 
a clownish, made-up appearance. 

“We’ve sorted and identified the 
fruits,” Sue culled to us. “The 
handbook is right. They’re deli- 
cious! We’ve got a fea.st spread. 
Just wait until you — ” She caught 
our expressions. “What’s wrong?” 
Benson shrugged. “You girls go 
on ahead and get the crowd to- 
gether. I have an imprortant an- 
nouncement to make.” Jane pouted 
a little and hesitated, but Benson 
insisted. “Run along now, please. 
I want to gather my thoughts.” 

We trailed after them slowly. I 

THE TEST COLONY 



didn’t like Benson’s moody reaction 
to our discovery of an intelligent 
life-form. To me it was exciting. 
What fabulous news I would have 
to send back with the first liason 
ship to contact ns four years hence! 
And it would be entirely unex- 
pected. hecauM* the original e.x- 
plonitioii party h.id failed to make 
the di.scovery. That in itself was 
an intriguing mystery. How could 
twenty-two s«'ientists, Ix-nt on a 
minute examination of ,i planet's 
flora and fauna, overltHik the most 
fabulous creation of all an animal 
virtually in men’s image? The only 
guess 1 could make was that they 
must belong to a nomadic tribe 
small enough to escape discovery. 

Benson broke silence as the nar- 
row beach strip began to widen 
into tile grassy plain where our 
ship squatted like a hemispherical 
cathedral. “This poses so many 
problems,” he said shaking his 
head. 

I said, “Phil, I think you’re tak- 
ing your job too seriously. You ju.st 
can’t plan every detail of organizing 
our community down to the ration- 
ing of tooth-powder.” 

“Planning never hurt any pro- 
ject,” Benson said. 

“I disagree,” I told him. “You’ve 
had too long to dwell on your plans. 
Now the first unpredictable incident 
throws you into an uproar. Relax, 
Phil. Take your problems one at a 
time. We don’t even know that 
we’ll ever sec the little creatures 
again. Maybe they’re shy.” 

He scarcely heard me. He was a 
large, well-muscled man of 46 
years, an ex-college president and 
an able administrator. He and 
Jane, his wife, were the only two of 
our party older tlian die 35-year

age limit. His background as a 
sociologist and anthropologist and 
his greater maturity were important 
factors in stabilizing a new colony, 
but his point of view had grown 
excessively conservative, it seemed 
to me. 

A crew of craftsmen with their 
busy little power saws had con- 
structed a sloping ship’s ramp of 
rough planks sawed from the near- 
est trees. We stepped through and 
over the assembled people who 
were lying around in the grass at 
the base of the ramp, and Benson 
mounted twenty feet above us at 
the entrance to the ship. 

Everyone was in high spirits, and 
a light cheer, rippled through the 
assembly. Benson, however, ignored 
it and bent a thoroughly serious 
gaze out over his “flock”. 

“Please give me your closest at- 
tention,” he began and waited until 
everyone was quiet. “Until further 
notice, we must jirocced under a 
yellow alert during daylight hours 
and a red alert at night. All work 
parties leaving the ship will check 
with the scribe every hour on the 
hour. We will resume sleeping in 
the ship. Women arc restricted to 
within 100 yards of the ship at all 
times. Men will go armed and will 
please inform themselves of their 
position on the security watch list 
which will be posted tonight.” He 
squinted in the bright sunlight. 
“For the moment, you men with 
sidearms, post your.scKcs around 
the ship. Sound olf loud if you sight 
anything larger than a rabbit.” 

The men named got slowly to 
their feet, fingering their light hunt- 
ing pistols self-consciously. Benson 
continued, “You may appreciate 
these precautions when I tell you 

10 



that Sam Rogers and I just en- 
countered two remarkably human- 
oid animals on the beach less than 
half a mile from here.” 

Tension replaced levity, as Ben- 
son described our meeting with 
the natives. I thought he gave it a 
needlessly grim emphasis with such 
terms as, “quicker than cats”, and 
“devilishly intelligcnl” , but I held 
my peace. 

He summarized, “I do not want 
to alarm anyone unduly, but we 
must face up to the fact that we 
are totally unprepared for such a 
contingency. The exploration group 
failed us badly in overlooking these 
creatures. They may not be inimical 
to our culture, but until this is es- 
tablished we must consider them 
prime threats. That is all,” he con- 
cluded. 

No one grumbled aloud, but 
their faces showed keen disappoint- 
ment at the resumption of quar- 
tering in the ship. Reluctantly, the 
women began rolling up the still- 
dellated air-mattresses that were 
scattered about the soft, deep grass. 
Sue complained, “Sam, if these 
people don’t get a little privacy 
pretty soon we’ll turn into an ant 
colony. There’ll be lovin’ in the 
streets.” 

“It’s not my idea,” I said. “I’ll 
be nailed to a table at the foot of 
the ramp all day making check 
marks. Phil is taking this entirely 
too big. The little people are really 
charming. He neglected to mention 
that they are beautifully formed 
and quite gentle in their^their 
actions.” 

“Actions?” she said. “What hap- 
pened, really?” 

1 described the conditions under 
which we first .saw the natives, and 

WINSTON MARKS 




he laughed a little strainedly. “I 
can just imagine the look on Phil 
Benson’s face.” 

I knew what she meant. In try- 
ing to enforce the shipboard rule 
of segregation of the sexes, our 
leader had dcvelopxid an oversen- 
sitive attitude toward certain as- 
pects of modesty. In the unutter- 
able boredom of space, the pledge 
we had all taken to complete con- 
tinence for the voyage was a severe 
test to all forty couples. 

Had propriety and space con- 
siderations been the only reasons 
for the infamous “no-romance” 
regulation, it would never have held 
up. But all concerned realized the 
problem of childbirth in space un- 
der the jam-packed living condi- 
tions, tight w^ter and food ration- 
ing and the fetid, recirculated air. 

Now the second honeyTnoons 
were over before they started. It 
was back to the ship and the night- 
life of monks and nuns. 

That night. Sue and I joined the 
four ship’s officers, their wives, 
Phillip Benson and Jane in the 
navigation cupola atop our doomed 
ship that had become a “fortress”. 
The small control room was the 
only semi-private room in the ship, 
and even Benson was admitted by 
invitation only. The meeting was 
a council of war, so to speak, and 
the officers were pressed into serv- 
ice to organize and ojjerate the 
security guard. 

When the guard watch was 
worked out for a week in advance, 
I spoke up. “I think we’re getting 
off on the wrong foot, Phil. We 
can’t stay penned up like animals 
at night and exp>ect to function as 
humans.” 

Benson argued: “We are a care- 

THE TEST COLONY 



fully balanced group, Sam. We 
can’t afford casualties. Look at our 
medical corps, two doctors and 
four nurses. Suppose we were at- 
tacked and lost them?” 

Captain Spooner, whose author- 
ity had lapsed when we touched 
down, backed up Benson. “I see no 
great hardship in the precautions. 
Inconvenience, yes, but nothing 
that the danger doesn’t fully jus- 
tify.” 

He was a cocky, virile, bald- 
headed little terrier of 35 years. 
His very young wife and the wives 
of the other three officers seenied 
only lightly perturbed at the pros- 
pects of continuing celibacy, which 
confirmed my suspicions. 

I said, “That’s gritty of you. Cap- 
tain, but remember, the rest of us 
haven’t had the relative privacy of 
the bridge. If this restriction con- 
tinues long I predict violations of 
the discipline, and probably some 
serious behaviour problems.” 

My position as colony psycholo- 
gist had become somewhat obscured 
under the snowstorm of paperwork 
tliat my sccondai-y job as official 
scribe had brought. Benson seemed 
now to recall that mental health 
was my concern. He said, “I 
thought you reported high morale 
upon arrival.” 

“I did, but the terrsions are there, 
and it's foolish to draw them too 
tightly. We have a well-picked, 
highly adaptable group of people. 
Let's keep them that way. The 
quicker we hit a more nonnal 
existence the less risk we run of 
emotional disturbances.” 

“They’ll take it,” Benson said 
positively, and Spooner nodded in 
arrogant agreement.

M y 20-HOUR wrislwatch, 
Reared to the shorter rotation 
of Sirius XXII, saiil nine o’clock, 
one hour before noon, when the 
Women began undressing. 

Tln-re had been an air of con- 
spiracy among them all morning, 
a studied casualncss as they wan- 
dered aroimd near the ship, form- 
ing small conversational eddies, 
dispersing and reforming elsewhere. 
I had just finished checking in the 
ll-man fruit-gathering detail. I 
looked up from my roster in time 
to sec the first motions of the “great 
disrobing”. Zippers unzipped, snaps 
popped open, slacks, skirts, blouses 
and jumpers fell to the grass, and a 
dazzling spectacle of spacc-bicached 
feminine epidermis burst into view. 

The ladies were very calm about 
It, but a chorus of yips sounded 
and swelled into a circus of cheers 
from the male working parties. 

Before I could fathom it Benson 
came charging down the ramp fol- 
lowed by his fruit-stowing detail. 
He stopped at the foot of the ramp, 
mouth open and eyes pinched with 
annoyance. 

He spotted Jane and Sue. “What 
is going on out here?” he demanded 
loudly. 

Our two wives waved at us and 
strolled over, doing a splendid job 
of acting unconcerned. “Just a little 
sun-bathing,” Jane said, shooing a 
small insect from a pale shoulder. 

Susan refused to meet my eye. 
She was watching two birds soar 
overhead. “It’s fantastic,” she said. 
“If you don’t look at things too 
closely, you’d never know we 
weren’t at a summer camp up in 
Wisconsin — except for the fruits. 
They remind me more of Tahiti. 
It’s marvelous! The mosquitoes 

12 



f 

don’t even bite.” 

“They will,” I said, “as soon as 
they get a good taste of human 
blood. And baby, you’re sure mak- 
ing it easy for them.” 

Benson was distracted from the 
conversation by the converging 
male colonists, who were whooping 
and yelling like a horde of school 
boys. He backed up the ramp and 
ordered, “Let’s get on with the 
work. You’\c seen your wives in 
the altogether before.” 

The men quieted a little, but one 
yelled, “Yeah, but not lately!” 
Another added, “And not all to- 
gether.” 

In spite of the fact that nude 
sun-bathing was a commonplace, 
twenty-second-century custom on 
Earth, by tacit consent clothes had 
been worn at all times aboard ship.* 
The women had gone along with 
Benson for two years on such mat- 
ters, so this was clearly a feminine 
protest against the spirit of the 
yellow alert. 

Young doctors Sorenson and 
Bailey came trotting up, grinning 
appreciatively but wagging their 
fingers. Without consulting Benson, 
Bailey mounted the ramp and 
shouted, “Blondes and redheads, 
ten minutes exposure. Brunettes, 
fifteen.” 

A great booing issued from the 
men, but Bailey held up his hand 
for silence. “The medical staff will 
make no effort to enforce these 
exposure maximums, but be advised 
that the radiation here is about the 
same as Miami Beach in June, so 
don’t let the air-conditioning fool 
you.” 

Benson was spared further deci- 
sions on the issue, because at that 
moment one of the sentries remem- 

WINSTON MARKS 




bered to take a quick look at the 
vector of forest he v/as supposed to 
be guarding. Unable to make his 
voice heard over the hub-hub, the 
guard fired his pistol in the air. 

We all jumped up and stared, 
and Benson muttered, “Dear God!” 

Our people were f cattered over 
an acre around the ramp, and en- 
compassing them was a semi-circle 
of at least a hundred “savages”, 
frozen like bronze statues at the 
sound of tlic gun-shot. They curved 
in an arc less than a hundred yards 
from the ship. 

Their hands were empty of weap- 
ons, and their motionless attitudes 
were in no way threatening. To 
the contrary, they seemed small and 
quite inoffensive e.xcept for their 
numbers. 

Acting in my capacity as p.sy- 
chologist, I ran up the ramp and 
called out as calmly as a shout 
would permit, “Ever>'body take it 
easy! Don’t make any quick moves. 
Above all, don’t anyone fire off a 
weapon again unless there is an 
obvious attack.” 

Benson clutched my arm. “Are 
you mad? We’ve got to get the 
women inside.” 

“That’s what I’m thinking,” I 
said. “But if we invite attack by 
running they won’t all make it.” 

“They aren’t armed. The men 
can stand them off.” 

“Then what are you worrying 
about?” I demanded. “Relax for a 
minute and see what happens.” 

Benson simmered and reluctantly 
accepted my logic. Meanwhile, the 
line of natives became mobile again. 
They closed in at a casual saunter, 
rolling off the balls of their long 
feet with a peculiar, slow, bounc- 

THE TEST COLONY 



ing motion. 

A ripple of subdued exclamations 
ran through our people, and in turn 
the little natives moved their lips, 
turned their heads to one another 
and seemed to be commenting 
among themselves. 

Benson began hissing futile com- 
mands for the vs'omen to start 
boarding the ship. No one paid any 
attention. I could sense no great 
danger in the situation. In fact I 
felt more attracted than repelled 
by the little golden-haired crea- 
tures. 

Bailey, who was still on the 
ramp, took a different view. He 
called out, “They don’t look dan- 
gerous, but keep away from them. 
Lord knows what kind of bugs they 
may have in them.” 

It was a sobering thought. Their 
most insignificant disease germ 
might easily wipe out our colony if 
it proved contagious. 

Yet, how could we stop these 
natives without inflicting blood- 
shed? On they came in their sham- 
bling, loosc-gaited walk. Benson was 
unsnapping his holster flap, and 
even the highly curious women 
were beginning to shrink back to- 
ward the gangplank, when a light 
breeze swept through us from be- 
hind. It rustled the grass softly and 
moved into the natives, only 20 
yards away. 

The wavering line stopped again. 
Segments began to retreat, first 
singly, then in pairs and groups. 
All but a handful of the most curi- 
ous suddenly bounded for the forest 
and disappeared. 

The others came forward again, 
but with increasing bewilderment. 
Repeatedly, they raised their noses 
and sniffed the air. 



13 



Bailey said from behind us, 
“They catch our scent and don’t 
know what to make of it. Tliank 
heavens most of them took off. We 
can handle a dozen of them easily 
enough.” 

Our p>coplc op>cncd ranks and let 
the little creatures infiltrate. Sue 
squeezed my arm. “Why, they’re 
beautiful little things! They make 
me feel self-conscious with my 
bleached-out skin. They certainly 
look intelligent, those eyes — no fear 
in them at all — look, they’re even 
smiling!” 

Indeed, several of the creatures 
were grinning broadly at the male 
members of our p>arty. They found 
our clothing amusing. 

Now we could hear their soft 
voices conversing in a language that 
was liquid with a great many com- 
pound vowel sound.s, not unlike 
Earth’s Finnish tongue. Their 
quick, dark eyes seemed to take in 
everything. They seemed torn be- 
tween a consuming curiosity and a 
strong aversion to our scent. One 
by one they satisfied the former and 
yielded to the latter, dropping back 
and racing for the forest in great, 
joyous bounds punctuated with 
happy little whoops of undefinable 
emotion. 

At last only one, chesty little 
male was left. Benson exhaled heav- 
ily beside me. “It’s the little fel- 
low we saw on the beach, Sam. 
Look, he’s coming through.” 

A tawny stripe of brown, furry 
hair ran from his high forehead, 
over the crown of his proud skull 
and down his neck to fade into the 
typical, deep, golden fuzz of his 
bc^y. As he approached the ramp 
I saw that his face was smooth, 
entirely free of hair as though 

14 



clean-shaven. 

By now Benson was as fascinated 
as the rest of us. I stepped down in 
front of him to confront our visitor. 
I placed a hand on my chest and 
said, “Sam Rogers!” 

The dark eyes swept from my 
feet to my head and fastened upon 
my face. He pointed four long 
fingers at me and repeated distinct- 
ly, “Samrogers.” 

My name is easy to pronounce, 
but it was a shock to hear it from 
the lips of an extra-terrestrial being. 

Then he placed the same hand 
on his own chest and said, “Joe!” 
Actually, it came out with a rapid 
widening and narrowing of his lips 
that sounded like a quick version 
of, “Jo-ah-o-ah-oh,” but the vowel 
echoes were so rapid that for prac- 
tical purposes it read, “Joe,” to 
me. 

I pointed my hand at him and 
repeated, “Joe!” He looked vaguely 
disappointed at my crude aspiratory 
control, but then a bright smile 
creased his cocky little face. His 
hand flicked out and back. 
“Samrogers — Joe.” 

Involuntarily I nodded my head. 
He nodded back and smiled again. 
Before I could think of what comes 
after, “Dr. Livingstone, I presume,” 
he wrinkled his nose, squinted his 
eyes, whirled and darted off for 
the timber. 

We stood rooted for a minute, 
then Bailey said, “We must really 
stink. Plucky little fellow took it as 
long as he could.” 

Ben.son looked back at Bailey and 
me. “Well, what do you think?” 

I looked at Bailey, and he looked 
at Dr. Sorenson. “Lord, I don’t 
know. Except for the possibility of 
microbe infection, they app>ear per- 

WINSTON MARKS 




fectly harmless to me,” Sorenson 
said. 

1 said, “Since they don’t like our 
scent there doesn’t seem to be much 
danger of contact. Phil, why don’t 
we call off the yellow alert with the 
exception of a rule or two about 
fraternization in closed spaces?” 
Benson looked over his people. 
All were paired off now, husband 
with wife. And to a man their arms 
were wrapped protectively around 
their respective spouses, watching 
for the decision. Their faces read, 
“Is this innocuous little race of peo- 
ple the cause of all the trouble?” 
Benson rubbed the gray of his 
temple with a knuckle. He mounted 
the ramp and announced, “The 
emergency is reduced to a blue 
alert. Women will have the free- 
dom of the clearing and the visible 
beach, but only authorized work- 
ing parties will enter the forest. 
Men will continue to wear side- 
arms. When outside shelters are 
complete we will sleep in them, but 
until then, or until we are better 
informed about the natives, we 
shall continue sleeping in the ship.” 

T he new order of the day did 
nodiing to mitigate the resent- 
ment and tension, but it did ac- 
celerate assembly of the lumber mill 
and house construction. The little 
Sirians seemed to have satisfied 
their curiosity, for they left us to 
our labors for a whole week. 

The first building of our pro- 
jected village was completed on the 
seventh day. It was little more than 
a two-room shanty, but it repre- 
sented the most sought after prize 
of the moment, privacy! 

We drew lots for it, and, with 

THE TEST COLONY 



the uncommon justice, one of the 
hardest working amateim carpenters 
won. The women brought in arm- 
loads of grass for a couch and 
decorated it with wild-flowers. 
When evening fell it seemed like 
an occasion lor a celebration, and 
Benson relented on the evening cur- 
few. 

We galheied .si raps from the 
lumber mill, e.iielullv cleared a 
sandy strip on (he lieaeh of all in- 
flammable matter and built a huge 
bonfire. In the rich atmosphere 
even the green wood burned mer- 
rily, spitting green sap anti sending 
up clouds of pungent, aromatic 
smoke. 

Sue had just curled up in the 
crook of my arm, and we were 
working on a case of Earth-nostal- 
gia, when we noticed our visitors 
again. They came bounding, up to 
the wide rim of the firelight. They 
jabbered in e.xcited, ecstatic voices 
but stopped short of our human 
assembly. Only one, I recognized 
him as Joe, picked his way through 
us and came close to inspect the 
crackling blaze. 

Fascinated, Sue and I watched 
his profile contort with an expres- 
sion of immense admiration. It was 
not the awe of a savage, but the 
heartfelt appreciation of a human 
for a rare and beautiful spectacle. 

“Fire must be unknown to 
them,” Sue whispered. 

“At least mighty rare,” I said. 
“The handbook says no volcanoes 
and no thunderstorms.” 

Joe turned at the sound of our 
low voices. With eyes half-blinded 
by the glare he searched for me. 
“Samrogers!” he called clearly. 
“Samrogers!” 

I rose to my feet and answered, 

15 




“Joe! Right here, Joe.” 

He picked his way over to me, 
smiling broadly and glancing back 
at the fire every step or two. A pace 
away he stopped, pointed at me, 
said, "Samrogers,” pointed at him- 
scl/, said, “Joe!” then pointed at 
the fire and waited. 

It was a clearly indirated ques- 
tion. I answered it respectfully, 
“Fire!” 

He repeated, “Fire,” and his eyes 
glowed like sparks. Then he made 
gestures of picking up some of the 
fire and taking it away, turning to 
me to pose the question. 

Sorenson, propped up on an el- 
bow, said, “I’ll be damned. He’s 
asking you to give him some of the 
fire.” 

“No,” Benson said. “He knows 
fire, knows you can’t take the 
flames. He’s asking for the means 
to build a fire.” 

I faced Joe, shook my head 
solemnly and said, “No!” To give 
meaning to the word I sat down 
and turned my head away for a 
moment. When I looked back Joe 
was looking very disappointed. It 
made Sue so sad that she held out 
a wedge of sweet melon to him. 

J oe accepted the gift easily, grace- 
ully and with a small smile of 
“thank you”. He turned back, 
squatted as near the blaze as com- 
fort would permit and chewed ab- 
sently at the melon. 

Thereafter he ignored the ani- 
mated conversation that sprang up 
among us. Jane wanted to know 
why we didn’t give him one of our 
lighters. “He’s just as intelligent as 
we are,” she insisted. She got no 
argtiment on that score, but her 
husband pointed out that the gold- 
en people were unaccustomed to 

16 



handling fire, and that during the 
present dry season even the green 
foliage might take off in a holo- 
caust if ignited in this rich, oxygen 
air. 

Even as he spoke, a long, slen- 
der pole, flaming at one end, top- 
pled from the settling fire and rolled 
near Joe. With scarcely a pause to 
debate, he leaped to his feet, 
grabbed the pole by the cool end 
and waved it aloft like a torch. 

With a triumphant yell he 
plunged through us and out across 
the field bearing his prize aloft 
trailing sparks. 

I tried to shoot low, but my 
light caliber pellet caught him 
rather high in the tliigh. He dived 
to the ground senseless in a shower 
of sparks. His fellow creatures im- 
metfiately gathered around him. 
When we closed in to retrieve the 
fire-wand and stamp out the 
sparks, the other natives faded 
away, crinkling tiieir noses. They 
made no effort to remove Joe, but 
cast many admiring glances back 
at the fire he had stolen. 

Sue came up storming at me. 
“You didn’t have to shoot him.” 
She started to kneel down beside 
him, but Dr. Bailey restrained her. 

“Easy, Susan. Remember the 
quarantine.” 

“We can’t let him lie there and 
bleed to death,” I said, feeling un- 
accountably ashamed for my deed, 
although there was scarcely an al- 
ternative. 

Benson came up, “Nice shot, 
Sam.” 

I said, “Phil, I want permission 
to enter quarantine with joe, here. 
Let me have the instruments, and 
I’ll probe for the bullet and take 
care of him.” 



WINSTON MARKS 



Benson shook his head. “We 
can’t take that chance. We 
couldn’t spare you if you caught 
something.” 

“Who could you spare better?” 
I demanded. “See here, we’ve got 
to find out sooner or later whether 
these little fellows carry anything 
contagious. If they do, well, then 
we have a decision to face, but wc 
can’t decide anytliing until we 
know.” 

Sue was at my side now. She 
said. “You have a dozen p>eople 
who can punch a micro-writer. 
Sam and I aren’t indispensable. 
Besides, it was he who crippled the 
poor little fellow.” 

Without waiting for an answer 
slie called out, “Larson, where arc 
you?” The lucky carpenter tried to 
draw back in the shadows, know- 
ing full well what she had in mind. 

Benson stared at me for a min- 
ute. He said gruffly, “Very well, if 
you can talk Larson out of his 
cottage, go ahead, play hero!” 

I didn’t feel very heroic right 
then. Two hours later, when we 
had the bullet out of Joe and had 
him bedded down comfortably for 
the night. Sue cosied up to me in 
our double sleeping silks and mur- 
mured, “What a guy has to go 
through out here to get a little 
privacy!” 

Poor Larson! 



B ailey and Sorenson set up 
their lab outside our cabin 
door. Joe’s wound was seriously 
infected, and none of our cautious- 
ly applied remedies would control 
the raging fever with which he 
awoke the first morning. He lay, 
apathetic, eyes half closed, mur- 

THE TEST COLONY 



muring, “Tala! Tala!” 

The doctors seized the oppor- 
tunity to launch a study of Sirian 
microbes, diseases and earth molds. 
Sue and I took cultures from Joe’s 
wound, and the medics experi- 
mented with the effects of local 
mold prodiu ls similar to the peni- 
cillin .series. By force-feeding we 
managed to keep Joe alive until 
Bailey, one morning, held up a 
hypo full of deal' li(|uid and told 
us how to administer it. 

Joe responded at c>nee. The fol- 
lowing day he began sitting up and 
vociferously demanding, “Tala, 
Tala!” 

“Must be his wife or girl-friend,” 
Sue deduced. She was wrong. Joe 
began making motions of a person 
lifting a vessel and drinking. When 
we offered fiim water he refused, 
repeating, “Tala!” and making 
more drinking motions. He tried 
to rise, but the pain iii his swollen 
thigh stopped him. He sank back 
licking his lips like a man dying 
of thirst, and in spite of his general 
improvement, he stayed in a sullen, 
subdued attitude. 

As his wound closed and the 
swelling reduced, Joe’s tempera- 
ture, which had reached a fabulous 
142 degrees F., stabilized at 137 F., 
thereby confinning Benson’s pre- 
diction that the natives would dis- 
play a much higher metabolism. 
Sue, who had spent hours strok- 
ing the fevered brow, had grown 
u.sed to Joe’s hot-bloodedness, and 
she teased me about my relative 
“frigidity”. 

Until Joe got his “tala” I made 
disappointing progress at teaching 
him our language. He picked up 
our words for those few items that 
ptertained to his comfort, such as 

17 




food, drink, bedpan and pillow — 
he revelled in the luxury of our 
down-filled pillows. But at first he 
evinced little interest in communi- 
cation. 

Then one morning we arose to 
find him standing and clinging 
weakly to the door jamb, search- 
ing the perimeter of the clearing 
with frantic eyes. 

We scolded him, but he ignored 
us. He spotted a fellow native 
examining one of the unfinished 
huts, which were going up at the 
rate of one a day. He called out 
in a loud, clear voice, and the little 
golden creature came running o\Tr 
to investigate. 

It was a lovely little female, and 
and I told Sue, “We have a re- 
union on our hands. Must be his 
mate.” 

But Joe was quite indifferent 
to her charms. She seemed toler- 
ably happy to see him, touched his 
bandages with long, gentle fingers, 
then hurried off to the forest as if 
in response to his commands. Joe 
made no effort to follow. He 
seemed still to realize that he was 
in good hands and was profiting 
by the care he was receiving. 

However, he chafed for the ten 
minutes or so before her return. 
We waited with high curiosity. 
I bet Sue that we were about to 
learn what “tala” was. When the 
female approached again we were 
mystified. “Why it’s just a mango,” 
Sue said. Indeed, the yellow- 
skinned, kidney-shaped fruit which 
the little native bore carefully in 
both hands appeared to be one of 
the over-sized specimens we had 
named after its smaller Earth coun- 
terpart. 

Joe reached greedily for the 

18 



fruit, poked a hole in the rind with 
a pointed forefinger and drank 
deeply. Watching from the door of 
our bedroom, we could smell a de- 
lightful, tangy scent that was only 
vaguely typical of the Sirian man- 
goes we had eaten. 

To our surprise, as Joe drank, 
the skin collapsed like a plastic bag. 
“It must be a different species, 
or else it’s much riper than any 
we’ve gathered,” Sue said. 

When Joe paused to breathe, 
the female took the fruit from 
him and sucked at it enthusiasti- 
cally. They sank down on Joe’s bed 
and took turns drinking the juice 
until the quart-sized .skin was 
crumpled and empty. 

I fear I interrupted an incipient 
romance in order to retrieve the 
discarded skin. The female wrin- 
kled her nose and made for the 
door. I watched her roll unsteadily 
across the clearing with eccentric 
little lurches. The bland smile on 
Joe’s handsome face deepened my 
suspicion. I pointed to the skin 
and asked, “Tala?” 

He nodded, patted his stomach 
and repeated, “Tala!” 

From that moment our relations 
improved immensely. Joe enlisted 
the help of various females to keep 
him supplied with skins of tala, 
and with the satiation of his crav- 
ing he took a completely new in- 
terest in life. 



W E SPENT hours every day 
working out our language 
difficulties. He learned so rapidly 
that I abandoned learning his lan- 
guage in favor of teaching him 
ours. Even such abstract concepts 
as time and space proved no ob- 

WINSTON MARKS 




Stacies. He grasjied the purpose of 
my wristwatch after a single day’s 
demonstration of its relationship 
to the passage of Sirius across the 
sky. 

Using a pencil I had managed 
to convey our symbols for large 
numbers. Joe could count up to 
any number now, and he seemed 
actually to understand the open- 
end nature of our .system of enu- 
meration. 

It made possible a mutual agree- 
ment on such matters as the num- 
ber of “days” in a year, which he 
was mildly interested to learn num- 
bered 440 on his planet. Then a 
startling piece of infonnation came 
from him when I asked how long 
his people lived. 

“Two years. Maybe three,” he 
replied. Because of the shorter days, 
a Sirian year about equalled an 
Earth year, and I found it dif- 
ficult to believe that these won- 
derful little animals lived only two 
or three years. He persisted until 
I believed him. 

He was strangely vague when I 
tried to determine the common 
manner of death. Indeed, personal 
death was a concept either so hazy 
or distasteful to him that he re- 
fused to dwell on it. The most he 
would convey was that there were 
always new faces in the tribe, and 
the old faces rarely remained more 
than three years. At this time, he 
described himself as being more 
than a year old. 

This was only one of several 
startling items that were revealed 
in our conversations. The golden 
people matured in three months 
to fully grown adults. A female 
could bear several babies a year 
and usually did. Yet Joe insisted 

THE TEST COLONY 



that his tribe was the only clan on 
the face of the planet, .so far as he 
knew, and that it numbered fewer 
than a thousand individuals. 

There was no such thing as 
monogamy or even [jolygamy. 
True, at night when the air was 
cooler, they paired off, male and 
female, and eacli male elinse from 
among several favorites. But there 
was no formal nor permanent mat- 
ing arrangement. 

Benson, who had set uj) a shel- 
tered desk outside Joe’s window 
in order to listen in witli an an- 
thropologist’s avid interest, i)o.sed 
the question which grew into quite 
a mystery. Under such fruitful con- 
ditions and ideal environment, 
why hadn’t Joe’s people overrun 
the planet? Even with the brief 
life-span, each female should pro- 
duce many babies. 

Joe had no answer. The problem 
didn’t interest him, and he refused 
to ponder it. He’d squat in the 
corner jealously guarding his limp- 
skinned mango, nipping at it oc- 
casionally when our questions 
failed to make sense. 

We were all, incidentally, quite 
curious to taste Joe’s tala juice, 
but it was his sole property. His 
lady-friends would hand it to no 
one but him, and he guarded it 
selfi.shly. Bailey and Sorenson had 
enlisted the help of our two organic 
chemists to examine the moist resi- 
due of the empty skins, but with 
their limited lab facilities all they 
could do was make guesses that 
the coveted juice wa,s the product 
of fermentation or enzymic action 
with which we were unfamiliar. 

As a psychologist 1 knew that 
Joe responded to the tala similarly 
to the way a human dipsomaniac 

19 




does to alcohol. When he was well- 
supplied he was cheerful and hap- 
py. When he ran out, he became 
taciturn and irritable. His frequent 
resort to the liquor, when we tried 
to force him to answer trouble- 
some questions, confirmed my sus- 
picion that there were certain mat- 
ters his brilliant mind simply re- 
fused to embrace, and the simplest 
way to avoid worrying about them 
was to take another drink of tala. 

Benson and I discussed this one 
afternoon while Joe was taking a 
nap. We sat in the shade of my 
hut spooning the lush pulp of a 
mango into our mouths. He said, 
“Everything points to a race of 
super-intelligence held down by 
slieer degeneracy.” 

“You mean the tala-drinking?” 
I asked. 

He nodded. “For one thing. Our 
work parties report that they never 
stop drinking the stuff. The older 
ones get quite plastered. I’ve seen 
it myself. Disgusting. And they 
have no common sense of, of — 
well, I shouldn’t say decency, be- 
cause obviou.sly morality as we 
know it just doesn’t exist. But 
thank heavens they don’t care for 
the scent of humans.” 

I said, “Don’t depend on that 
too much. I asked Joe about it, 
and he said that we don’t neces- 
sarily smell bad to them. It’s just 
so alien to any scent they’ve known 
that they tend to shy off. Joe is 
quite used to it now. He lets Sue 
rub his back and his head. She’s 
made quite a p>et of him.” 

Benson didn’t like this news at 
all. He p>ondcred thoughtfully for 
a moment. “That means that 
they’ll all gradually get used to be- 
ing around us. I don’t like it, Phil. 

20 



They’re just human enough to 
have a bad influence on the colony. 
They’re dissolute and entirely with- 
out ambition. In fact they seem to 
have damned little race survival 
instinct at all.” 

I had pondered this many times, 
but it hadn’t struck me as esfjecial- 
ly dangerous to the colony, ^nson 
went on, “We have a glorious 
planet here, rich in minerals and 
other natural resources. By com- 
parison, Earth is so wom-out and 
depleted and over-crowded that the. 
contrast is almost too great.” 

“What are you driving at?” I 
demanded. 

“Just this. From the first the 
biggest problem here has been to 
prod everyone to work. We have 
a civilization to build here, and 
that means clearing more land, 
breaking the soil, mining, construc- 
tion. manufacturing.” 

“Look,” I said somewhat im- 
patiently, “you don’t expect 80 
people to accomplish all this in 
four years, surely?” 

“I expect progress,” he said firm- 
ly. “Do you realize that when wc 
finished the last of the forty houses 
that virtually ended the building 
program? Work on the two ware- 
houses, the water system, sewage 
disposal plant and the commissary 
wc planned is almost at a stand- 
still.” 

“The people want time to finish 
up their homes and m.ikc them 
comfortable,” I objected. 

“That’s what they say,” he told 
me, “but they’re fooling away their 
time.” 

“Phil, we’ve only been here a 
month, and — ” 

“And if I hadn’t pulled a blue 
alert,” he interrupted, “we 

WINSTON MARKS 



wouldn’t even have the residentials 
built yet. Now they’ve got their 
precious privacy, and the pressure 
is off. They’d rather go chasing 
off into the woods to hunt exotic 
fruit and peek at the natives than 
get on with the project.” 

I hadn’t realized things were this 
serious. “Don’t they obey orders 
any more? What about your work 
schedules?” 

“I’ve pushed them as hard as 
I can without forcing a test of my 
authority,” he said. “They claim 
they dc.serve time to get adjusted 
and relax a little before buckling 
down.” 

“I agree with them,” I said. 
“They’re all serious, industrious 
people, and this is still an adven- 
ture with them. It will wear off 
pretty soon, and they’ll be yearning 
for comforts of Earth. They’ll 
buckle down when the rainy season 
hits,” I predicted. 

“I wonder. Here’s one good ex- 
ample. Look over there. Donne- 
gan’s food detail is just now re- 
turning with its first load. They left 
three hours ago.” He yelled over 
to the foreman. 

Donnegan, a large, pleasant- 
faced biologist sauntered over to 
us. Benson said, “Was the expe- 
dition successful?” 

Donnegan brushed off the sar- 
casm. “Fooling aside, it is getting 
to be something of an expedition 
to find fruit. The natives are clean- 
ing it out near at hand.” 

Turning to me Benson said, 
“There’s another thing. The little 
devils have settled all around us, 
and everything is community prop- 
erty with them. Not only do they 
strip the fruit but they pick up 
anything that isn’t nailed down 

THE TEST COLONY 



and wander off with it.” 

“That’s odd,” I said. “Joe in- 
dicates that they place no value 
on possessions normally.” 

“Oh, they don’t keep things,” 
Donnegan explained. “They pack 
them off, fiddle with them and 
then we find them strewn all over 
the forest. Sometimes I’d like to 
wring their little necks!” 

Benson looked up at him quickly. 
“Sounds funny coming from you, 
Paul. You were one of their chief 
defenders at tlu- meeting last 
week.” 

Donnegan’s face darkened. 
“That was last week, before I 
found out a few things. As a mat- 
ter of fact, I think it’s time you 
knew about them, too.” He 
squatted down by us and unbur- 
dened himself. 



A S IT SO often will, a barrier 
had erected itself between the 
colony members and their leader, 
Phillip Benson. Donnegan some- 
what shamefacedly confessed what 
had gone on behind this curtain of 
silence. 

It seemed that two weeks earlier 
Bromley, one of the chemists, had 
contrived some rather crude, old- 
fashioned, sulphur-and-phospho- 
rus, friction matches. Trading on 
the native’s delight with fire, he 
had bribed them with matches to 
give him one of the tala-mangoes 
which he tasted, then promptly 
proceeded to swill until he was 
quite drunk. 

In a generous mood he passed 
out matches to other male mem- 
bers of the colony who, in turn, 
made the barter and joined the 
party. 



21 




“The stuff is really delicious,” 
Donncgan admitted. “And it 
doesn't even give you a hang-over.” 
“Go on,” Benson invited coldly. 
Within a few days, Donnegan re- 
lated, ev«TylKidy was nipping on 
the tala. Bromley was turning out 
a steady supply of matches from 
his lab. and they were now the go- 
ing currency for trading with the 
natives. In order to keep their 
wives quiet the men brought the 
super-ripe mangoes home and 
shared them. 

The precious fruit, it developed, 
came from regular mango trees but 
reached the desired, fermented 
condition only at the leafy crowns 
of the trees where even the nimble, 
light-weight natives found it 
hazardous and difficult to reach 
them. Bromley said that he knew 
of several native casualties from 
fatal falls that had occurred since 
the traffic in tala increased. 

Benson asked the question that 
was in my mind. “What caused 
you to come to me at this late 
date?” he demanded. “Something 
more serious must have happened.” 
“Well, I didn’t mind the tala- 
drinking so much — but, well. Cap- 
tain Spooner and I came back to 
his hut one afternoon this week 
and found his pretty little wife with 
one of the natives — a male. 
Spooner thought it was a big joke 
— he was a little drunk at the time, 
and so was his wife. But I don’t 
think it’s any joke at all.” 

Benson was on his feet, his face 
livid. “What else?” 

Bromley said, “I checked around 
a little bit, and I found that quite 
a few of our people are making 
pets out of the natives. The little 
devils have got used to our scent, 

22 



and they’ll do anything just to 
watch a match bum.” 

“But the quarantine?” I said. 

“I guess they figure it’s safe 
enough. Personally, 1 don’t. But 
they feel that since you and Sue 
have escaped any disease there’s 
no reason for the non-fraternizing 
rule, not even in closed spaces. Sev- 
eral couples I know hold parties 
every night in their huts after dark. 
They invite a couple of nati\-es 
who supply the tala. They all sit 
around a candle. The natives sleep 
there.” 

He kicked at an empty tala 
skin that Joe had tossed out the 
door earlier. “Things are out of 
hand, and I’m ashamed I haven’t 
come to you sooner, Benson.” 

Phil was so outraged he couldn’t 
speak. I said, “Thanks, Donnegan. 
You did the right thing.” 

He left us, and while Benson 
was struggling to control his anger 
I said, “It’s a wonder they haven’t 
burned the place down. The forest 
must be damp enough to sustain 
fire, or they certainly would have 
set one.” 

“It might have been better.” 
Benson said, “if they had burned 
the whole damned planet up! And 
you thought I was exaggerating! 
There you have it, a perfect set-up 
to make beachcombers out of the 
whole colony. Plenty of free food, 
liquor, beautiful native girls and a 
mild climate.” 

“And native boys,” I added, re- 
memljering suddenly tliat I was 
harboring one of the “pets” under 
my own roof. 

Benson clenched his fists. “From 
the first I knew what the answer 
must come to. I just didn’t have 
the guts to face it.” 

WINSTON MARKS 



I nodded. “I suppose we’ll have 
to drive them off." 

“Drive them off, nothing! 
They’re nomads, and they’d be 
back sooner or later. There will 
always be people in the colony 
willing to deal with them secretly, 
and the natives are clever enough 
to circumvent any discipline I 
aim against them.” 

“What else can you do, short 
of — genocide?” 

“Why rule out genocide? Sam, 
face it! Race extermination is the 
only permanent and satisfactory 
solution.” 

The thought was abhorrent to 
me, but he argued, “If we don’t 
eliminate them entirely they’ll al- 
ways be around to plague us. Just 
picture what this or any future 
colony would look like after a year 
or two of uninhibited mingling 
and loafing and swilling down that 
tala. Is that the civilization that 
Eartli sent us out here to establish?” 
In every part of the universe 
where living conditions have been 
too kind and discipline too lax, 
men have been known to go native, 
and suddenly 1 felt that Benson 
had been much more acute in his 
apprehensions than I, a graduate 
psychologist who was supposed to 
understand human nature. 

Somewhat subdued I said, “How 
do you plan to accomplish a com- 
plete extermination? If we start 
hunting them down they’ll just 
fade into the woods. Besides, you'd 
have a devil of a time getting 
agreement among our people to 
take on such a messy project.” 

“It has to be done, that's all. I 
want you to keep completely 
quiet about what we’ve learned 
until I can think about it. Bromley 

THE TEST COLONY 



should have some ideas. He’s a 
biologist.” 

When Ben.son said, “biologist”, 
the obvious solution popped into 
my head. “If we could sterilize 
tliem — all the males, anyway — they 
have siuh a shori lifi'-span — •” 

“ l oo slow. Besides, how arc you 
going to coax all the males to lie 
down and " llis eyes opened 
wider, “Radiation!'’ 

“Exactly. We l;ike them for a 
tour ol the ship, inelniling tin* X- 
ray booth, and pom on the power.” 
“Might be ilone at that. But it 
would be so slow." 



S LOW OR NOT, no better jilan 
was conceived amotig six of us 
who met secretly that night in 
Benson’s new ship ([uarters. Don- 
negan brought his fellow biologist, 
Terrence Frost, and I had con- 
tacted the two medics. We reached 
swift agreement as to the neces- 
sity of taking steps, and decided to 
work on my rough plan. It was 
also voted not to divulge our in- 
tentions to the others, and then the 
meeting broke up. 

When I returned to my hut, 
Jane was sitting cross-legged just 
outside my door visiting with Su- 
san. I thought .she would be curi- 
ous about the confidential nature 
of the meeting from which she was 
excluded, but she had other tilings 
on her mind. She stood up and 
said, “I think your patient is re- 
covered, and you’ve got a problem, 
mister.” She stalked off into the 
night. 

I looked at Sue’s pink face and 
half-guessed the answer before she 
told me. It seemed that Joe had 
suddenly developed amorous in- 

23 



clinations. Sue had the habit of 
stroking his head like a pet dog, 
and this evening, without warning, 
Joe had beg^n returning the ca- 
resses in a manner so casual and 
gentle tliat Sue hadn’t noticed the 
trend. 

From a more objective view- 
point, however, Jane had observed 
the rather unplatonic indications 
of Joe’s attitude and mortified Sue 
by drawing her attention to it with 
an acid remark. 

In my fury I fancied that Joe 
had tried to take advantage of my 
absence. His cleverness in avoid- 
ing such advances in iny presence 
was nullified by his error of assum- 
ing that Jane would pose no ob- 
stacle. 

At present he sprawled in his 
comer beside an empty mango 
skin, breathing rapidly, innocently 
asleep. The incident served to drive 
home Donnegan’s story and steel 
me against the many twinges of 
conscience I was to suffer in our 
campaign to wipe out Joe’s race. 

It also served as an adequate ex- 
cuse, in Sue’s eyes, when I told 
Joe the next morning that he was 
quite well enough to return to the 
forest. This was a fact we both 
had known for over a week, but 
Joe in his indolent way, had been 
quite content to remain and talk 
with me endlessly. Until now, I 
had welcomed his presence as an 
inexliaustiblc source of information. 

He accepted the dismissal with- 
out rancor and promised to return 
and visit us next spring. 

“Next spring?” 1 said. 

“We will leave soon,” he said. 
“We go south in the autumn.’’ 

“Wait,” I said. And I told him 
that as a gesture of friendship we 

24 



had decided to take all males of 
his race for a tour through the 
ship. Would he take this word to 
his people? 

He said he would, but his face 
became very thoughtful. 

That afternoon they formed a 
short line at the ramp, and the 
“tours” began. The line was short 
because they refused to wait long 
for anything, but as the line short- 
ened, others came from the woods 
to take their places. To produce a 
favorable “press” on our show and 
thus assure perfect attendance by 
all the males, Benson rigged several 
mechanical displays of flasliing 
lights and whirling devices. 

They were delighted, and when 
they got to the X-ray booth, to 
induce them to stand still we set 
up a gas torch with a beautiful, 
vermilion, strontium flame. The 
only problem at this point was to 
get them to move on alter they 
got their painless dose of sterilizing 
radiation. 

Every tenth “golden boy” was 
shunted into a small chamber filled 
with organ, the instant anaesthetiz- 
ing gas, and Dr. Sorenson, wearing 
an oxygen mask, would catch him 
as he fell, take his specimen, hand 
it through a slot to Dr. Bailey and 
then drag the unsuspecting victim 
into the frc.sh air where the nurses 
took over with more wonders to 
distract his attention. 

This running spot-check on the 
collected .semen samples assured us 
that our radiation was effectively 
destroying the spermatozoa. 

I sat at my old place at the 
base of the ramp, weeding out tire 
occasional females who tried to 
sneak in and also checking to sec 
that we had no repeats. 

WINSTON MARKS 



Our method was simplicity it- 
self. As each native finished our 
tour an attendant atomized a faint 
but very pcnnan»‘iit stain of water- 
proof dye on tlu- hair of the right 
slioulder blade. It wa.s hardly no- 
ticeable unless you were looking 
for it, and that was one of my jobs. 

In two days wc “toured" 481 
males. 

A week later the night rains be- 
gan, and our unwclcomed neigh- 
bors vanished. 



B enson had postponed his 
little lecture deliberately, and 
now he called us all togetlicr for a 
fatherly talk which 1 helped him 
prepare. He begun abruptly. 

“Since nature has been so boun- 
tiful in providing us with tala, I 
don’t intend to proclaim any silly 
prohibition regarding its consump- 
tion. With a little reflection, how- 
evi-r, I hope that all of you can 
understand that we must have 
.some control. I am fully aware that 
many of you arranged your own 
private channels for obtaining this 
liquor, but with the departure of 
our tree-climbing friends the easy 
soui'ce has dried u]j. 

“Now, to prevent some of you 
from breaking your fool necks try- 
ing to climb the trees yoursebes, I 
propose that we place tala in the 
commissary as a normal ration to 
be issued equitably to all — when 
it is available. And working to- 
gether, our clearing parties will, no 
doubt, fell enough mango trees to 
give us all a fair taste.” 

Benson’s une.xpected tolerance 
and remarkable proposal was re- 
ceived with mixed embarrassment, 
relief and enthusiasm. He went on, 

THE TEST COLONY 



“We have enjoyed almost two 
months of rather unrestrained par- 
tying, and I'm not going to rail at 
you for some of the illicit behaviour 
that came to my attention. So far 
the intimacies which some of you 
took with the natives have pro- 
duced no epidemics nor bastard 
offspring on cither side. However, 
were I to accept V"ur actions as 
ty|jical of the liiiiue, 1 would con- 
sider our cohiny iloomeil already 
and write oil' this planet as milil 
for further investment by Earth 
civilization. 

“Instead, I feel you will, during 
the winter months, regain your 
perspective and apply yourself to 
the principles which brought us 
here and must continue to bind 
us together if we are to survive as 
a permanent culture.” 

Benson’s speech had the desired 
effect. Without the little |jeople 
around to distract us, the colonists 
plunged into their work, and things 
got done. True, a ratiher dispro- 
portionate numlxtr of logs brought 
in by the falling crews turned out 
to be mango-wood, but the tala- 
rationing program added incentive 
precisely where it was needed. The 
perimeter of our clearing advanced 
rapidly, the cultivating and plant- 
ing parties followed closely behind, 
and the .sawmill added an indus- 
trious sound to the whole opera- 
tion. 

As Benson had hoped, w'hcn the 
people buckled down they once 
again began yearning for the con- 
veniences they had left on earth. 
The chemists finally contrived 
suitable raw materials for the plas- 
ticizer and began manufacturing 
screens for our gaping windows, 
muchly-needed pipe for our water 

25 




and sewage systems and even a 
few “frivolous” luxuries such as 
cups, saucers and fruit bowls. The 
commissary and other public build- 
ings were planked out roughly, and 
the hospital-clinic was completed 
before the first two babies arrived. 

The history-making blessed event 
was an honor and an onus to Cap- 
tian Spooner and his young wife. 
To father the first human offspring 
on Sirius XXII was the fond hope 
of many of us, but Spooner and the 
Second Officer had something over 
a light-year head-start on the rest 
of us. 

Infant Spooner arrived just 5^2 
months after our landing. The 
Mate’s baby came two weeks later. 
Sue herself svas satisfyingly preg- 
nant. By spring it was obvious that 
Earth’s gynecologists had chosen the 
members of our colony well, and 
there would be no dearth of young 
blood. Fully a third of the women 
were expecting, and Sue’s date in- 
dicated she would have won the 
derby if it hadn’t been for the ship’s 
officers’ perfidy. 

The colony as a whole was in 
good shape. As the most pressing 
work was disposed of, the men took 
turns at the pleasant hunting de- 
tails, and we began enjoying fresh 
meat from the small game of the 
forest. 

On one such trip I brought back 
a live little animal that looked like 
a cross between a three-toed sloth 
and a teddy bear, except that he 
had a long, woofly snout like an 
ant-eater. He seemed to be hiber- 
nating in the crotch of a small 
tree, and when I shook him down 
he cuddled up and clung to my 
neck so lovingly that I decided he’d 
make a good pet for Sue. 

26 



The little cub kept nipping af- 
fectionately at my neck on the hike 
back, and he clung so close he was 
a nuisance, but Sue was delighted. 
We had to improvise a cage at 
night to keep him from mauling us 
and keeping us awake. 

Sue named him, “Toots”, and we 
were the envy of all the camp. 
When Joe and his people returned 
tliree weeks later, and we discovered 
the truth about Toots, the others 
were happy they hadn’t acquired a 
similar pet. 

I T WAS late spring, and the 
mango trees were rapidly refill- 
ing their high branches with the 
tala-fruit. We now had a roofed 
central kitchen where the women 
prepared our meals. We ate at long 
tables in the open. 

Shortly after the noon meal one 
day, Joe and his people returned. 
He caught up to Sue and me as 
were strolling to our hut for our 
daily fifteen-minute siesta. He ap- 
peared tiled from the journey but 
quite glad to see us. I felt the pangs 
of conscience as I added my hypo- 
critical welcome to Sue’s warm 
greeting. 

In his old room we sat on the 
rough furniture I had fashioned, 
and Joe eyed Sue’s fruitful con- 
tours. “A baby soon, eh? We have 
many babies among us.” 

“You — have?” I said. 

“Many were born on the return 
trip. They slowed up the females 
with their sucking. For eight days 
they are a burden on the mother.” 
Sue exclaimed, “Eight days? 
Then what happens?” 

The subject id not greatly in- 
terest Joe. “Then they find their 

WINSTON MARKS 




own food — if the koodi does not 
find them first.” 

“What in the world is a koodi?” 
Sue asked with a shiver. 

Joe was silent for a minute. He 
wrinkled his broad brow and looked 
at me. “Samrogers, you asked me 
many questions about how we die. 
I did not understand this death for 
a long time. Now I know. It is 
when the koodi comes. He comes 
to the very young and to the old. 
The babies are too small to hold 
him oir. The old drink much tala, 
then the koodi comes to them. This 
is my thiid year, and my thirst for 
tala is great. The koodi will come.” 
His words painted a clear picture 
of a superstitious concept of death, 
personifying it even as humans re- 
fer to the “grim reaper”. But Sue 
took a different view. “What does 
the koodi look like?” she persisted. 

Joe looked jiuzzled. He raised a 
long, four-segmented finger and 
pointed to a corner of the room 
where Toots was curled up like a 
fur neck-piece. “He looks like that. 
There is a koodi.” 

My first impulse was to reject 
the statement as ridiculous. Toots 
was as haiinless as an over-sized 
kitten. Besides, the manual made 
no mention of — 

Sue made a small sound in her 
throat. Her face was colorle.ss. 
“Sam! Get him out of here!” 

“But the manual — 

“d’he manual didn’t mention 
Joe’s people, either,” she said half- 
hysterically. “Gel Toots out of 
here.” 

Still unbelieving I walked over 
and hauled the little fuzzy animal 
up into my arms. Instantly, he cud- 
dled close and rammed his pointed 
snout under my open collar and 

THE TEST COLONY 



began nibbling at my neck. I took 
him outside, and out of perverse 
curiosity I let him have his way 
with my neck. At first it tickled, as 
always, but instead of batting his 
head away I let him nibble with 
his soft, pointed lips. 

.Sue called out, “Sam what are 
you doing? Kill him, Sam!” 

His lips spread into a little cir- 
cle on my flesh and began sucking 
gently. There was no pain, just the 
throb of my jugular under his 
mouth. Now his long, soft, hairy 
arms became firmer around my 
neck. I jerked back and they 
gripped hard. A chill of panic 
stabbed me, and I could feel the 
taut flesh of my neck drawn more 
deeply into his puckered lips. 

I tugged at him silently, not wish- 
ing to frighten Sue. He wouldn’t 
come loose. In broad, noon-day- 
light I had a Sirian vampire in my 
arms, threatening to rupture my 
jugular vein and kill me within 
speaking distance of half a hundred 
people. I tried to level my voice. 
“Joe, would you come out here, 
please?” 

He came at once, stared with a 
blank expression and said, “You 
have been drinking much tala?” 

“Help me, dammit!" I said, hold- 
ing my voice down. “I can't shake 
him loose. He’s trying to — ” The 
long, tight arm squeezed off my 
breath. In turn I tried to strangle 
him, but under the thick fur was a 
bony protection where there should 
have been .soft neck. 

“It does no good to kill the 
koodi,” Joe said. “There is always 
another. Once they hold you tightly 
it is too late.” 

Sue thought differently. She 
came through the door like a hell- 

27 




cat. Catching up her garden hoc 
she swung a blow that, had it mi.ssed 
Toots, would have crushed my 
skull. But Sue didn’t miss. I fell on 
my back, and Toots let go, dead 
of a broken spine. 

HE “LIQUOR control board” 
was Benson’s best idea. Not 
only did it put tala on a legitimate 
basis, but it controlled our dealings 
with the natives. Bromley, the 
chemist, who was the original of- 
fender, was charged with manu- 
facturing the wooden matches, and 
the medium of exchange was con- 
centrated in the hands of the com- 
missary “purchasing agent”. 

The reason that Benson sanc- 
tioned the controlled tala trade 
with the natives stemmed from our 
apparent failure to sterilize the 
males. There was, indeed, a huge 
crop of native babies, tiny little 
dolls that looked like spider 
monkeys and dropped from their 
mothers’ breasts after little more 
than a week. 

The brisk tala trade w.as part of 
our program to keep the natives 
in close association while we de- 
vised ways and means to discover 
the cause of our failure. All quaran- 
tine rules had long .since been 
dropped, and Sorenson and Bailey 
began inventing ruses to lure the 
males into the gas chamber again. 

Weeks passed while we worked 
our way through the whole male 
population again, testing for fer- 
tility and X-raying it wherever we 
found it. Through Joe we adver- 
tised new wonders to be seen in the 
ship, and as the sight-seers left we 
tagged each with an atomized spot 
on the other shoulder, indicating 

28 



that he was still sterile or had just 
become so. 

This time we tallied 496 males 
which, according to Joe, was cer- 
tainly the whole masculine popula- 
tion. The mystery of our failure 
at genocide forced an unpleasant 
decision on Benson. The biologists 
and medics insisted that we must 
win the natives’ confidence even 
further to gain their cooperation. 
As the heat of summer bore down 
and the mercury rose, we eased off 
on the work schedule and delib- 
erately planned social functions to 
which we had Joe invite a group of 
natives. There were picnics and 
beach parties where our guests 
brought their own tala, and ours 
was carefully rationed. Group sing- 
ing entranced the little golden peo- 
ple, and they took remarkable de- 
light in the discovery of their own, 
sweetly pitched voices. Enterprising 
Joe. with his remarkable memory, 
soon became unofficial song leader, 
and all day long we would hear 
the natives practicing. 

Sue’s baby came, a sturdy little 
boy whom we named Richard 
Joseph — Sue insisted on the second 
name, and I couldn’t argue her 
out of it without revealing my 
reasons. Within two weeks the clin- 
ic’s nursery was full of babie.s, and 
it was at this point that the na- 
tives’ interest became deeply stirred. 

The language barriers were 
breaking down rapidly. Many of 
our regular visitors were females, 
and with Joe’s help as an inter- 
preter they were soon able to ask 
questions. Their greatest curiosity 
hinged on the fabulous care we 
gave our infants. 

Although I wouldn’t permit Sue 
to do it, several of our women be- 

WINSTON MARKS 





gan using fcmalo natives for baby- 
sitters. This lead to the first Ijasic 
behaviour change we had noticed. 
The females began to pay more 
attention to their own offspring. It 
was as if they had just discovered 
the pleasure of fondling their babies 
and watching them crawl and kick 
and gurgle. Even after the first 
week they were still carrying 
them around, finding choice mor- 
sels of fruit for them, fanning off 
the insects and singing them to 
sleep with their new-found abilities 
to make music. 

Benson noticed it and called a 
meeting of the secret si.x. He .said, 
“Our little program had better 
work this time or we are in for it. 
Apparently this kuodi animal that 
Sam had the tussle with is the 
principal population control, and 
now the mothers are packing tlieir 
kids around until they're old 
enough to fight off the koodi.” 

Donnegan shook his liead. 
“Damned if I can find out vvliere 
we slipped up. Frost and I just 
finished a series of tests with native 
ova and human sperm. They don’t 
mix. Of course, we didn't expect 
them to, but what in hell is the 
answer?” 

I hadn’t known of this project. 
I said, “You didn’t think tliat our 
male colonists — ” 

Benson scowled with cxas|)cra- 
tion. “We don’t know what to 
think, Sam! We sterilized 481 na- 
tive males last fall, and the babies 
are just as thick as ever.” 

I said, “Well, we got to 496 of 
them this time. That should do it 
for sure. Joe says he'll keep a look- 
out for any males without the two 
stains on his shoulder.” 

Benson narrowed his eyes. “You 

THE TEST COLONY 



know, it strikes me that Joe is being 
awfully helpful. What reason did 
you give him for wanting this in- 
formation?” 

“He didn’t ask,” I said. 

O UR 12-MONTII year was 
composed of 87-day months, 
excc])t February which we shorted 
six days to make it come out even. 

.According to this calendar the 
“May-flies” came in July, just a 
month before our first anniversary. 
The little winged insects were a 
seasonal life-form, one more item 
that csc.ipcd the exploratory party, 
and lor which we were unprepared. 

They came out of the north, and 
they .struck us before we could take 
shelter in the ship or our plastic- 
screened huts. They were a little 
smaller than flying ants, and even 
their long wings were jet-black. 
Their bites were infinitesimal, but 
each one smarted like a prick w ith 
a hot needle. 

In the midst of the confusion of 
rescuing babies and herding every- 
one in doors, I noticed that all the 
natives had disappeared into the 
forest. Everyone had suffered a 
hundred bites or more, and we 
were sorry, swollen sights. Sue in- 
sisted that I cover myself and make 
a run for the clinic to see if Dr. 
Bailey had any remedies for the 
bites. Richard Jo.sc|)h was crying 
loudly from the irritation, so I 
agreed. 

It was only 75 yards to the clin- 
ic, and I made it without collecting 
many more stings. But the doctors 
had nothing to offer. They were 
dabbing various salves, astringents 
and pastes on test patches of their 
own skin, but nothing seemed to 

29 



have any cfTcct at all. 

"All we hope," said Sorenson, “is 
that the (lies aren’t microbe-car- 
riers.” 

I started out the door to return 
then stepjH'd back and peered 
throuj^h the screen. The forest was 
erupting with natives. They stag- 
gered into the clearing, headed for 
the center of it and sank down as if 
with great weariness. On and on 
they came until the ground among 
our buildings was literally paved 
with their prone bodies. 

“Poor devils," Bailey murmured 
as the clouds of flies continued to 
sweep through our village. “Noth- 
ing we can do, though. I wonder 
why they come out in the open? 
You’d think they had better pro- 
tection in the trees.” 

I had no answers, so I covered 
my head again and tnade a dash 
for my own hut. Inside I brushed 
off the clinging flies and stamped 
on them. “The medics don’t have 
any help for us,’’ 1 said. Then I saw 
him. 

Sue was struggling to hold Joe 
on his feet. His arms were drap>ed 
loosely over her shoulders, and for 
a second I couldn’t decided whether 
he was ill or making a pass at Sue. 

I pulled him ofl' her by one shoul- 
der. He swung around and toppled 
into my arms. Remarkably few in- 
sect bites showed under the trans- 
parent haze of golden hair, but he 
recked of tala. 

“You’re drunk,” I yelled at him. 
“A lot of help you arc at a time 
like this!” 

“Tala,” he said from loose lipts. 
“Much tala.” 

“You’ve had much tala, all 
right!” I said disgusted. 

Sue said, “We’ve got to let him 

30 



stay in here, Sam. The flies will cat 
him alive out there.” She went to 
the window and knocked the flies 
from the outside of the screen. 
Then she screamed. I thought she 
had just discovered the massed na- 
tives. but she kept on screaming 
until I went to her and looked out. 

In the late afternoon sun, fuzzy 
little brown animals were waddling 
out of the forest, closing in on the 
900 or more natives l>ing senseless 
in the clearing. Koodi! Dozens of 
them. 

I forgot my screaming wife, my 
ers'ing infant, the drunken wife- 
stealer slumped on the floor. I for- 
got the torture of my own stings. 
All I remember is snatching my 
pLstol from its holster that hung by 
the door and plunging out and 
pulling the trigger until fire ceased 
to come out of it. Then I was 
kicking and smashing with a tree 
limb, and every blow smaslied one 
of the vile little ghouls into the 
grass. I thought I saw Ben.son bring 
and kicking, but I blacked out be- 
fore I could be sure. 

I regained consciousness with the 
flies still keening in my ears. Sue 
was calling my name and slapping 
me sharply in the face. Joe was 
trying to pull me to my feet, but 
the last thing I remember is the 
both of us collapsing to the ground. 

T AWOKE days later with a bum- 

ing fever and gloriously drunken 
sensation of floating. Joe brought a 
fruit to me when he saw I was stir- 
ring. I drank the thin, tangy juice 
in one breath and sank back into 
a deep sleep again. 

My next drink came from the 
long, slender fingers of a pretty lit- 

WINSTON MARKS 




tie female native. This time it was 
water, and I stayed awake. Joe 
came in, saw I was awake and came 
back in a few minutes with Ben- 
son and Dr. Bailey. 

They both looked terrible, Ben- 
son especially. Bailey said, “Take it 
easy. Sue’s at the clinic. She and 
the baby are all right, but you 
damned near didn’t make it.” 
Benson said, “Can you talk?” 

I cleared my throAt and decided 
I could. He waved Joe and the 
female out. Then he and Bailey sat 
down beside me. I asked, “Any 
casualties?” 

“Two of our babies and thirty-six 
native babies. Some of the koodi 
came in after dark.” 

It sounded strange, Benson’s list- 
ing native casualties with our own. 

The memory of the koodi attack 
brought a wave of nausea over me. 
I said, “Benson, I’m sorry, but I’m 
all done trying to murder Joe’s race. 
I want no further part of it.” 
Benson’s face was thin and 
drawn, and he stared at the floor. 
“If we haven’t murdered it al- 
ready,” he said, “there will be no 
more attempts while I am in 
charge.” He covered his face with 
his hands. “Bailey. Tell him, 
Bailey.” 

The doctor’s voice was gravelly 
and weak. “If it hadn’t been for 
the natives we’d all have died. The 
venom from the flies paralj'zed 
everyone the second day after the 
swarm hit us. The flies w'ere gone 
the next morning, hut every soul 
in the colony pa.sscd out. Joe and 
his friends took care of us, poured 
tala down our throats and fed us.” 
“But they were soused,” I said. 
“Their only defense against the 
flies. The little black devils left the 

THE TEST COLONY 



natives pretty well alone, and it ap- 
pears that the tala was responsible. 
Could be that the stuff is what 
neutralized the toxin, too. They 
must have poured a gallon of it 
down me, judging from the empty 
skins by my bed. .\t any rate, they 
kejjt us alive until we could get 
up and feed ourselves.” 

“Why did they come into the 
clearing when they drank the tala?” 
I asked. 

Bailey said, “Joe told us that the 
day he saw Sue kill the koodi th.ii 
was attacking you, he got the idea 
that he should do something about 
them himself. Through his efforts 
the natives no longer take the little 
devils as an inevitable evil. They 
kill them wherever they find them 
now. And when they had to get 
drunk to save themselves from the 
flics, Joe pa.sscd the word for them 
to hit for the clearing. The koodi 
usually avoid the sunlight, but it 
was late in the afternoon. They 
came anyway.” 

“Phil,” I said, “did I sec you out 
there with me, killing the little 
bastards?” 

He nodded silently. 

“You had changed your mind 
about the natives at that time?” 
“I — I suppose so. Don’t rub it in, 
Sam. It’s hard enough to live with 
the thought of how wrong I was. 
All I can do now is pray that what- 
ever failed in our first try failed 
again. Joe’s peoitle have made the 
human race look pretty dismal. 
They have every right to their 
planet, and if we are fooli.sh enough 
to go native, well — at least we have 
a stronger survival instinct.” 

At that point Susan came in 
carrying Richard. He had the hic- 
coughs. Sue kissed me. “Richard 

31 



just drew his ration of sterile tala 
from the clinic. He still has a slight 
fever. But thanks to Joe and Har- 
mony — ” 

“Harmony? Who’s that?” 

“The native girl who helped Joe 
nurse us. Her name is really Hah- 
ah-arin-ig-hin-ih-hee. or some- 
thing like that. She answers to Har- 
mony, though.” 

And she did. Hearing her name 
the little golden girl came through 
the door towing Joe by one hand. 

I said, “One of your favorites, 
Joe?” 

He ran a caressing, four-fingered 
hand over her shoulder. “I like 
her,” he admitted. “She wants to 
call me husband like Sue calls you.” 
Bailey smiled. “It seems there is 
a new fad among the natives. Some- 
thing like monogamy, I under- 
stand.” 

I said, “What do you think of the 
idea, Joe?” 

He thought it over. “I have not 
made up my mind.” 

Sue pressed him, “Why not mar- 
ry Harmony, Joe?” 

In the blunt manner in which he 
so often made his curious revela- 
tions, Joe blurted out, “Because I 
am in much demand among all the 
females. It is — very pleasant.” 
Bailey’s eyes widened. He or- 
dered, “Bend over, Joe.” 

Joe obliged so we could all ex- 
amine his back. There were two 
brown stains on his shoulder blades 



as there should be, but Bailey was 
not sati.sfied. He ]X)ked a finger 
into them and examined the skin 
under the hair. “Mango pitch!” 
he announced. “Stained clean down 
to the skin. Did you do that, Joe?” 
“Yes." 

“Why?” 

“1 knew you would force me to 
go into the ship with the others if 
I didn't have the stain.” 

Bens<in looked up, shocked. 
“Then you — you knew what we 
were trying to do?” 

“Yes. You and Sainrogers spoke 
of it outside the hut one day. You 
thought I was asleep. Some of 
your words puzzled me, so I stayed 
away from the ship. Then I found 
out what they meant.” 

“But you helped us get the others 
to go into the .ship!” 

“It was what you wanted,” Joe 
said simply. “Later, when we went 
south, the females saw that only 
Joe’s favorites continued to have 
babies. So Joe became very — popu- 
br.” 

I said, “You mean they figured 
it out?” 

Joe smiled. “Did you think we do 
not know about — ” he pau.sed to 
dredge among his amazing store of 
human idioms, “ — tlie facts of life?” 
Bailey shook his head. “What a 
man! What a race! Think what 
they would be if they had a hu- 
man’s survival instinct!” 

“And thumbs,” I added. • • •

If Saranta wished to qualify as one who loved 
his fellow man, he should have known that often 
the most secretive things are the most obvious. 

IHSQIJALIFIEI) 

BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



iMFTER the morning inspection 
tour, Tardo, the Solar Coun- 
cil’s Planetary Aid agent, and his 
companion, Pco, were taken to the 
castle which stood on a hill over- 
looking the area. 

Tardo and Peo were entertained 
royally at luncheon by Saranta, 
their host, who appeared to be the 
wealthy overlord of this portion of 



the planet. The meal was delicious 
— tender, inch-thick steaks served 
with delicate wine sauce and half 
a dozen of the planet’s exotic vege- 
tables, topped olT by a cool fruit 
dcs.sert. 

“My recommendation will be of 
considerable importance to you,” 
said Tardo as they ate. “If it is fa- 
vorable, there is certain technical 





aid aboard ship which will be made 
available to you at once. Of course, 
you will not receive advanced 
equipment from the Solar Council 
until there is a more thorough in- 
vestigation.” 

“I’m afraid our culture is too 
simple and agrarian to win your 
approval,” .said Saranta modestly. 

“That isn’t a major considera- 
tion. The Council understands the 
difficulties that have faced colonics 
in other star systems. There arc cer- 
tain fundamental requirements, of 
course : no abnormal religious prac- 
tices, no slavery . well, you under- 
stand what I mean.” 

“We really feel that we have 
done well since we . our ances- 
tors, that is . colonized our world 
a thousand years ago,” said Saran- 
ta, toying with a wineglass. A smil- 
ing servant filled the glasses of Tar- 
do and Peo. “^’ou see, there was no 
fuel for the ship to explore other 
planets in the system, and the ship 
just rusted away. Since we arc some 
distance from the solar system, 
yours is the first ship that has landed 
here since colonization.” 

“You seem to have been lucky, 
though,” said Peo. He was naviga- 
tor of the Council ship, and had 
asked to accompany Tardo on the 
brief inspection trip. “You could 
have landed on a barren planet.” 

“Well, no, the colonizers knew it 
was liveable, from the first explora- 
tion expedition,” said Saranta. 
“There were difficulties, of cour.se. 
Luxuriant vegetation, but no ani- 
mal life, so we had no animals to 
domesticate. Pulling a plow is hard 
work for a man.” 

“But you were able to solve this 
situation in a humanitarian way?” 
asked Toredo, peering at him keen- 

34 



ly. “That is to say, you didn’t resort 
to slavery?” 

Saranta smiled and spread his 
hands slightly. 

“Does this look like a slave so- 
ciety to you?” he countered. “The 
colonists were anxious to co-operate 
to make the planet liveable. No one 
objected to work.” 

“It’s true we’ve seen no slaves, 
that we know about,” said Tardo. 
“But two days is a .short time for in- 
spection. 1 must draw most of my 
conclusions from the attitudes of 
you and the others who are our 
liosts. How about the servants 
here?” 

“They are paid,” answered Sa- 
ranta, and added ruefully: “There 
are those of us who think they are 
paid too well. They have a union, 
you know.” 

Tardo laughed. 

“A carry-over from Earth, no 
doubt,” he commented. “An unus- 
ual one, too, for a culture without 
technology.” 

When the meal was over, the 
two men from the ship were con- 
ducted on a tour of the area. It was 
a neat agricultural community, 
with broad fields, W'ell-constructed 
buildings and, a short distance from 
Saranta’s castle-like home, a village 
in which artisans and craftsmen 
plied their peaceful trades. 

Peo tried to notice what he 
thought Tardo would look for on 
such a short inspection. The Coun- 
cil agent, he knew, had had inten- 
sive training and many years of 
experience. It was hard for Peo to 
judge what factors Tardo would 
consider significant — probably very 
minor ones that the average man 
would not notice, he thought. 

Tardo had seemed most intent 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



on the question of slavery, and Peo 
looked for signs of it. He could see 
none. The people of the planet had 
had time to conceal some things, of 
course. But the people they saw in 
the village wore a proud air of inde- 
pendence no slave could assume. 

Saranta apologized for their hav- 
ing to walk, explaining that there 
was no other means of transporta- 
tion on the planet. 

“And, without transportation, 
you can understand why we have 
not been able to develop a technol- 
ogy,” he added. “We hope trans- 
port will be included in the first 
assistance you will give us.” 

Tardo asked about the fields. 

“I see there is no one working 
them,” he said. “Is that done by 
the villagers?” 

“Our labor supply is transient,” 
an.swered Saranta after a moment’s 
hesitation. “The laborers who will 
work our fields — for a wage, of 
course — are probably in the next 
town or the one beyond it now.” 

Alpha Persei was sinking in the 
western sky when Tardo and Peo 
took their leave of Saranta and 
made their way down the road to- 
ward their planetary landing craft. 

“It looks like a good world to 
me,” said Peo. “If tomorrow’s in- 



spection is as satisfactory, I suppose 
you will recommend the beginning 
of technical aid?” 

“There will be no inspection tour 
tomorrow, and I shall recommend 
against aid at (his time,” replied 
Tardo. “I’ve seen enough.” 

“Why?” asked Peo, surprised. 
“There are two classes of people 
on this planet, and we've seen only 
one,” said Tardo. “Tlio.se we have 
seen are freemen. The others are 
no better than animals. We give no 
aid that helps men tighten their 
hold over their fellows.” 

“If you haven’t seen them, how 
do you know there is another class?” 
demanded Peo. “There is no evi- 
dence of any such situation.” 

“The evidence is well hidden. 
But if you think your stomach can 
take it now, I’ll tell you. If you re- 
member your history, colonizing 
ships 1000 years ago had no space 
to carry animals along. They had 
to depend on native animal life of 
the planet, and this planet had 
none.” 

“Saranta said that But I don’t 
see . .” 

“Those were delicious steaks,

CONFIDENCE GAME 



Cutter demanded more and more and more efficiency — and got 
it! But, as in anything, enough is enough, and too much is .. 



BY JAMES MCKIMMEY, JR. 





G eorge H. cutter wheeled 

his big convertible into his re- 
served space in the Company park- 
ing lot with a flourish. A bright 
California sun drove its early 
brightness down on him as he 
strode toward the square, four- 
story brick building which said 
Cutter Products, Inc. over its front 
door. A two-ton truck was grinding 
backward, toward the loading 
doors, the thick-shouldered driver 
craning his neck. Cutter moved 
briskly forward, a thick-shouldered 
man himself, though not very tall. 
A glint of light appeared in his 
eyes, as he .saw Kurt, the truck 
driver, fitting the truck’s rear end 
into the tight opening. 

“Get that junk out of the way!” 
he yelled, and his voice roared over 
the noi.se of the truck’s engine. 

Kurt snapped his head around, 
his blue eyes thinning, then recog- 
nition spread humor crinkles 
around his eyes and mouth. “All 
right, sir,” he said. “Just a second 
while I jump out, and I’ll lift it 
out of your way.” 

“With bare hands?” Cutter said. 
“With bare hands.” Kurt said. 
Cutter’s laugh boomed, and as 
he rounded the front of the truck, 
he struck the right front fender 
with his fist. Kurt roared back from 
the cab with his own laughter. 

He liked joking harshly with 
Kurt and with the rest of the truck 
drivers. They were simple, and they 
didn’t have his mental strength. 
But they had another kind of 
strength. They had muscle and 
energy, and most important, they 
had guts. Twenty years before Cut- 
ter had driven a truck himself. The 
drivers knew that, and there was a 
bond between them, the drivers 



and himself, that seldom existed 
between employer and employee. 

The guard at the door came to 
a reflex attention, and Cutter 
bobbed his head curtly. Then, in- 
stead of taking the stairway that 
led up the front to the second 
floor and his office, he strode down 
the hallway to the- left, angling 
through the shop on the first floor. 
He always walked through the 
shop. He liked the hi a\v ilriving 
.sound of the machines in his ears, 
and the muscled look of the ini ii, 
in their coarse work shiits and 
heavy-soled shoes. Here again was 
strength, in the machines and in 
the men. 

And here again too, the bond be- 
tween Cutter and his employees 
was a thing as real as the whir and 
grind and thump of the machines, 
as real as the spray of metal dust, 
spitting away from a spinning saw 
blade. He was able to drive him- 
self dirough to them, through the 
hard wall of unions and prejudices 
against bu.siness suits and white 
collars and soft clean hands, be- 




37 



cause they knew that at one time 
he had also been a machinist and 
then tool and die operator and 
then a shop foreman. He got 
through to them, and they respect- 
ed him. They were even inspired 
by him, Cutter knew, by his energy 
and alertness and steel confidence. 
It was one good reason why their 
production continually skimmed 
along near the top level of effi- 
ciency. 

Cutter turned abruptly and 
started up the metal-lipped con- 
crete steps to the second floor. He 
went up quickly, his square, al- 
most chunky figure moving smooth- 
ly, and there was not the faintest 
shortening in his breath when he 
reached the level of his own office. 

Coming up the back steps re- 
quired him to cross the entire ad- 
ministration office which contained 
the combined personnel of Produc- 
tion Control, Procurement, and 
Purchasing. And here, the sharp 
edge of elation, whetted by the 
walk past the loading dock and 
the truck drivers and the machine 
shop and the machinists, was 
dulled slightly. 

On either side of him as he 
paced rapidly across the room, 
were the rows of light-oak desks 
which contained the kind of men 
he did not like; fragile men, 
whether thin or fat, fragile just 
the same, in the eyes and mouth, 
and pale with their fragility. They 
affected steel postures behind those 
desks, but Cutter knew that the 
steel was synthetic, that there was 
nothing in that mimicked look of 
alertness and virility but posing. 
They were a breed he did not un- 
derstand, because he had never 
been a part of them, and so this 

38 



time, the invisible but very real 
quality of employer-employee rela- 
tionship turned coldly brittle, like 
frozen cellophane. 

The sounds now, the clicking of 
typewriters, the sliding of file 
drawers, the squeak of adjusted 
swivel chairs — all of it — irritated 
him, rather than giving him in- 
spiration. and so he hurried his 
way, esiiecially when he passed that 
one fellow with the sad, frightened 
eyes, who touched his slim hands 
at the papers on his desk, like a 
cautious fawn testing the sound- 
ness of the earth in front of him. 
What was his name? Linden? God, 
Cutter thought, the epitome of the 
breed, this man: sallow and slow 
and so hesitant that he appeared 
to be about to leap from his chair 
at the slightest alarm. 

Cutter broke his aloofness long 
enough to glare at the man, and 
Linden turned his frightened eyes 
quickly to his desk and began shuf- 
fling his papers nervously. Some 
day. Cutter promised himself, he 
was going to stop in front of the 
man and shout, "Booo!” and scare 
the poor devil to hell and back. 

He pushed the glass doors that 
led to his own offices, and moving 
into Lucile’s ante-room restored 
his humor. Lucile, matronly yet 
quick and youthfully spirited, 
smiled at him and met his eyes di- 
rectly. Here was some strength 
again, and he felt the full energy 
of his early-morning drive return- 
ing fully. Lucile, behind her desk 
in this plain but expensive recep- 
tion room, reminded him of fast, 
hard efficiency, the quality of ac- 
complishment that he had dedi- 
cated himself to. 

“Goddamned sweet morning, eh, 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 




Lucy?” he called. 

“Beautiful, George,” she said. She 
had called him by his first name for 
years. He didn’t mind, from her. 
Not many could do it, but those 
who could, successfully, he re- 
spected. 

“What’s up first?” he asked, and 
she followed him into his own 
office. It was a high-ccilinged room, 
with walls bare e.xcept for a pic- 
ture of Alexander Hamilton on one 
wall, and an award plaque from die 
State Chamber of Commerce on 
the op|)osite side of the room. He 
spun his leather-cushioned swivel 
chair toward him and sat down and 
placed his thick hands against the 
surface of the desk. Lucile took the 
only other chair in the office, to 
the side of the desk, and flipped 
open her appointment pad. 

“Quay wants to see you right 
away. Says it’s important.” 

Cutter nodded slightly and closed 
his eyes. Lucile went on, calling his 
appointments for the day with 
clicking precision. He stored the 
information, leaning back in his 
chair, adjusting his mind to each, 
so that there would be no energy 
wasted during the hard, swift day. 

“That’s it,” Lucile said. “Do you 
want to see Quay?” 

“Send him in,” Cutter said, and 
he was already leaning into his 
desk, signing his name to the first 
of a dozen letters which he had 
dictated into the machine during 
the last ten minutes of the preced- 
ing day. 

Lucile disappeared, and three 
minutes later Robert Quay took her 
place in the chair beside Cutter’s 
desk. He was a taller man than 
Cutter, and thinner. Still, tliere 
was an athletic grace about him, a 

CONFIDENCE GAME 



surencss of step and facial expres- 
sion, that made it obvious that he 
was physically fit. He was single 
and only thiity-fue, twelve years 
younger than Cutter, but he had 
been with Cutler Products, Inc. for 
thirteen years. In college he had 
been a Phi Beta Kappa and let- 
tered three years on the varsity as a 
quarterback. He was the kind of 
rare combination that Cutter liked, 
and Cutter had ofTcred him more 
than the Chicago Cardinals to get 
him at graduation. 

Cutter felt Quay’s presence, with- 
out looking up at him. “Cod- 
damned sweet morning, eh. Bob?” 

“It really is, George,” Quay said. 

“What’s up?” Gutter stopped 
signing, having finished the entire 
job, and he stared directly into 
Quay's eyes. Quay met the stare 
unflinchingly. 

“Fve got a report from Sid Perry 
at Adacam Research.” 

“Your under-cover agent again, 
eh?” 

Quay grinned. Adacam Research 
conducted industrial experimenta- 
tion which included government 
work. The only way to find out 
what really went on there. Cutter 
had found out, was to find a key 
man who didn’t mind talking for a 
certain amount of compensation, 
regardless of sworn oaths and signa- 
tures to government statements. 
You could always get somebody. 
Cutter knew, and Quay had been 
able to get a young chemist, Sidney 
Perry. 

“Okay,” Cutter said. “What are 
they doing over there?” 

“There’s a fellow who’s ollered 
Adacam his project for testing. 
They’re highly interested, but 
they’re not going to handle it.” 

39 



“Why not?” 

Quay shrugged. “Too touchy. It’s 
a device that’s based on electron- 
ics — ” 

“What the hell is touchy about 
electronics?” 

“This deals with the human per- 
sonality,” Quay said, as though that 
were explanation enough. 

Cutter understood. He snorted. 
“Christ, anything that deals with 
the human personality scares them 
over there, doesn’t it?” 

Quay spread his hands. 

“All right,” Cutter said. “What’s 
this device supposed to do?” 

“The theory behind it is to pro- 
duce energy units which reach a 
plane of intensity great enough to 
effect the function of the human 
ego.” 

“Will it?” Cutter never wasted 
time on surprise or curiosity or 
theory. His mind acted directly. 
Would it or wouldn’t it? Perform- 
ance versus non-performance. Effi- 
ciency versus inefficiency. Would it 
improve production of Cutter Pro- 
ducts, Inc., or would it not? 

“Sid swears they’re convinced it 
will. The factors, on paper, check 
out. But there’s been no experi- 
mentation, because it involves the 
human personality. This thing, 
when used, is supposed to perform 
a definite personality change on the 
individual subjected.” 

“How?” 

“You know the theory of psy- 
cltiatric therapy — the theory of 
shock treatment. The effect is some 
what similar, but a thousand times 
more effective.” 

“What is the effect?” 

“A gradual dissolving of inferior- 
ity influences, or inhibitions, from 
the personality. A clear mind result- 

40 



ing. A healthy ego.” 

“And?” 

“Confidence.” 

Cutter stared at Quay’s eyes, 
assimilating the information. 
“That’s all very damned nice. Now 
svhere does it fit in with Cutter 
Products?” 

Quay drew a notebook from his 
coat pocket swiftly. “You remem- 
ber that efficiency check we had 
made two months ago — the rating 
of individual departments on com- 
parable work produced?” 

Cutter nodded. 

Quay looked at his notebook. 
“All administrative personnel de- 
partments showed an average of — ” 

“Thirty-six point eight less effi- 
ciency than the skilled and unskilled 
labor departments,” Cutter fin- 
ished. 

Quay smiled slightly. He snapped 
the notebook shut. “Right. So that’s 
our personnel efficiency bug.” 

“Christ, I’ve known that for 
twenty years,” Cutter snapped. 

“Okay,” Quay said quickly, alert- 
ing himself back to the serious 
effort. “Now then, you’ll remember 
we submitted this efficiency report 
to Babcock and Steele for analysis, 
and their report ofl'eied no answer, 
because their experience showed 
that you alu'oyt get that kind of 
ratio, because of personality differ- 
ences. The administrative personnel 
show more infieriority influences 
per man, thus less confidence, thus 
less efficiency.” 

“I remember all that,” Cutter 
said. 

“Their report also p>ointed out 
that this inevitable lo.ss of efficiency 
is leveled out, by proportionately 
smaller wage compensation. The 
administrative personnel gets ap- 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 




proxiinatcly twenly-fivc percent less 
compensation tlian the skilled labor 
personnel, and the l emaining eleven 
point eight percent loss of efficiency 
is made up by the more highly 
efficient unskilled labor receiving 
approximately the same compensa- 
tion as the administrative person- 
nel.” 

“I remember all that nonsense, 
too,” Cutter reddened faintly with 
a sudden anger. He did not believe 
tlie statistics were nonsense, only 
that you .should expect to write off 
a thirty-six point eight effici<'ncy loss 
on the basis of adjusted compensa- 
tion. A thirty-six point eight effi- 
ciency loss was a comparable loss 
in profits. You never compensated 
a loss in profits, except by erasing 
that loss. “And so tliis is supposed 
to fix it?” 

Quay’s head bobbed. “It’s worth 
a try. it seems to me. I’ve talked 
to Sid about it extensively, and he 
tells me that Bolen, who’s developed 
this thing, would be willing to in- 
stall enough units to cover the en- 
tire administrative force, from the 
department-head level down.” 

“How?” 

Quay motioned a hand. “It’s no 
larger than a slightly thick saucer. 
It could be put inside the chairs.” 
Quay smiled faintly. “They sit on 
it, you see, and — ” 

Cutter was not amused. “How 
much?” 

“Nothing,” Quay said quickly. 
“Absolutely nothing. Bolen wants 
actual tests badly, and the Iirstitute 
wouldn’t do it. Snap your fingers, 
and give him a hundred and fifty 
people to work on, and it’s yours to 
use for nothing. He’ll do tJie install- 
ing, and he wants to keep it secret. 
It’s essential, he says, to get an ac- 

.CONFIDENCE GAME 



curate reaction from the subjects 
effected, For him it’s perfect, be- 
cause we’re running a continuous 
efficiency check, and if this thing 
does the job like it’s supposed to do 
it, we’ll have gained the entire 
benefits for nothins'. Huw can we 
lose?” 

Cutter stared at Quav for a mo- 
ment, his mind working swiftly. 
“Call Horner in on this, but no- 
body else. Absolutely nofiodv else. 
Tell Horner to write up a ( onlracl 
for this fellow to sign. Gel a clause 
in there to the effect that this fel- 
losv, Bolen, assumes all responsibil- 
ity for any effects not designated 
in the defining part of the contract. 
Fix it up so that he’s entirely 
liable, then get it signed, and let’s 
see what happens.” 

Quay smiled fully and stood up. 
“Right, sir.” He had done a good 
job, lie knew. This was the sort of 
thing that would keep him solidly 
entrenched in Cutter’s favor. 
“Right, George,” he said, remem- 
bering that he didn't need to call 
Cutter sir anymore, but he knew 
he wouldn’t hear any more from 
Cutter, because Cutter was already 
looking over a blueprint, eyes thin 
and careful, mind completely ad- 
justed to a new problem. 



E dward bolen called the 

saucer-sized disk, the Gonfidet. 
He was a thin, short, smiling man 
with fine brown hair which looked 
as though it had just been ruffled 
by a higii wind, and he moved. Cut- 
ter noticed, with qtiick, but certain 
motions. The installing wa.s done 
two nights after Cutter’s lawyer, 
Homer, had written up the contract 
and gotten it signed by Bolen. Only 

41 




Quay, Bolen, and Cutter were pres- 
ent. 

Bolen fitted the disks into the 
base of the plastic chair cushions, 
and he explained, as he inserted 
one, then another: 

“The energy is inside each one, 
you see. The life of it is indefinite, 
and the amount of energy used is 
proportionate to the demand 
created.” 

“What the hell do you mean by 
energy?” Cutter demanded, watch- 
ing the small man work. 

Bolen laughed contentedly, and 
Quay flushed with embarrassment 
over anyone laughing at a question 
out of Cutter’s lips. But Cutter did 
not react, only looked at Bolen, as 
though he could see somehow, be- 
neath that smallness and quietness, 
a Certain strength. Quay had seen 
that look on Cutter’s face before, 
and it meant simply that Cutter 
would wait, analyzing expertly in 
the meantime, until he found his 
advantage. Quay wondered, if this 
gadget worked, how long Bolen 
would own the rights to it. 

Cutter drove the Cadillac into 
Hallery Boulevard, as though the 
automobile were an English Austin, 
and just beyond the boundaries of 
the city, cut olT into the hills, slid- 
ing into the night and the relative 
darkness of the exclusive, sparsely 
populated Green Oaks section. 

Ten minutes later, his house, a 
massive stone structure which 
looked as though it had been shifted 
intact from the center of some 
medieval moat, loomed up, gray 
and stony, and Capra, his handy- 
man, took over the car and drove 
it into the garage, while Cutter 
strode up the wide steps to the 

42 



door. 

Niels took his hat, and Mary was 
waiting for him in the library. 

She was a rather large woman, 
although not fat, and when she 
wore high heels — which she was 
not prone to do, because although 
Cutter would not ■ have cared, she 
kept trying .to project into other 
people’s minds and trying, as she 
said, “Not to do anything to them, 
that I wouldn’t want them to do to 
me.” — she rose a good inch above 
Cutter. She was pleasant humored, 
and cooperative, and the one great 
irritant about her that annoyed 
Cutter, was the fact that she was 
not capable of meeting life whole- 
heartedly and with strength. 

She steadily worried about other 
people’s feelings and thoughts, so 
that Cutter wondered if she were 
capable of the slightest personal 
conviction. Yet that weakness was 
an advantage at the same time, to 
him, because she worked con.stantly 
toward making him happy. The 
house was run to his minutest lik- 
ing, and the servants liked her, so 
that while she did not use a strong 
enough hand, they somehow got 
things done for her, and Cutter had 
no real complaint. Someday, he 
knew, he would be able to develop 
her into the full potential he knew 
she was capable of achieving, and 
then there wouldn’t be even that 
one annoyance about her. 

He sat down in the large, worn, 
leather chair, and she handed him 
a Scotch and water, and kissed his 
cheek, and then sat down opposite 
him in a smaller striped-satin chair. 

“Did you have a nice day, dear?” 
she asked. 

She was always pleasant and she 
always smiled at him, and she was 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 



indeed a handsome woman. They 
had been married but five ycar.s, 
and she was almost fifteen years 
younger than he, but they had a 
solid understanding. She respected 
his work, and she was earef\il with 
the money he allowed her, and she 
never forgot the Scotch and water. 
“The day was all right,” he said. 

“My goodness,” she said, “you 
worked late. Do you want dinner 
right away?” 

“I had some sandwiches at the 
office.” he said, drinking slowly. 

“That isn’t enough,” she said re- 
proachfully, and he enjoyed hi'r 
concern over him. “You’d better 
have some nice roast beef that 
Andre did just perfectly. And 
there’s some wonderful dressing 
that I made myself, for just a small 
salad.” 

He smiled finally. “All right,” he 
said. “All light.” 

She got up and kissed him again, 
and he relaxed in tlic large chair, 
sipping contentedly at his drink, li.s- 
tening to her footsteps hurrying 
away, the sound another indication 
that she was doing something for 
him. He felt tired and easy. He let 
his mind relax with his body. The 
gadget, the Confidet; that was go- 
ing to work, he knew. It would erase 
the last important bug in his opera- 
tional efficiency, and then he might 
even ex]>and, the way he had 
wanted to all along. He closed hi.s 
eyes for a moment, tasting of his 
contentment, and then he heard the 
sound of hi.s dinner being placed on 
the dining room table, and he stood 
up briskly and walked out of the 
library. He really was hungry, he 
realized. Not only hungry but, he 
thought, he miglit make love to 
Mary that evening. 

CONFIDENCE GAME 



T he first indication that the 
Confidet might be working, 
came three weeks later, when Quay 
handed Cutter the report showing 
an efficiency increase of 3.7 per- 
cent. “I think that should tell the 
story,” Quay s.iid elatedly. 

“Doesn’t mean anything,” Cutter 
said. “Could be a thousand other 
factors besides that damned gim- 
mick.” 

“But we’ve never been able to 
.show more than one ]toint live 
variance on the administ! ati\ e 
checks.” 

“The trouble with you. Quay,” 
Cutter said brusquely, “is you keep 
looking for miracles. You think the 
way to get things in this world is 
to hope real hard. Nothing comes 
easy, and I’ve got half a notion 
to get those damned silly things 
jerked out.” He bent over his work, 
obviously finished with Quay, and 
Quay, deflated, paced out of lire 
office. 

Cutter smiled inside the empty 
office. He liked to see Quay’s en- 
thusiasm broken now and then. It 
took that, to mold a really good 
man, because that \say he as.suitied 
real strength after a while. If he 
got knocked down and got up 
enough, he didn’t fail a;tart when 
he hit a n'ally tough obstacle. Cut- 
ter was not unhajjpy about the 
efficiency figmes at all, and he 
knew as well as Quay that they were 
deci.sive. 

Give it another two weeks, he 
thought, and if the increase was 
comparable, then they might have 
a real improvement on their hands. 
Those limp, jumpy creatures on the 
desks out there might actually start 
earning their keep. He was thinking 
about that, what it would mean to 

43 




the total profit, when Lucilc opened 
hLs door and lie caught a glimpse of 
the oflice outside, including the 
clerk with the sad, frightened eyes. 
Kvi'ii you, Linden, Cutter thought, 
we might even imp/ove you. 

The increase was comparable 
after another two weeks. In fact, 
the efficiency figure jumped to 8.9. 
Quay was too e.\cited to be knocked 
down this time, and Cutter was 
unable to suppress his own pleas- 
ure. 

“This is really it this time, 
George,” Quay said. “It really is. 
And here.” He handed Cutter a set 
of figurc.s. “Here’s what accounting 
estimates the profit to be on this 
eight-nine figure.” 

Cutter nodded, his eyes thinning 
the slightest bit. “We won’t see 
that for a while.” 

“No,” Quay said, “but we’ll see 
it! We’ll sure as hell sec it! And if 
it goes much higher, we'll absolute- 
ly balance out!” 

“What does Bolen figure the top 
to be?” 

“Ten percent.” 

“Why not thirty-.six point eight?” 
Cutter said, his eyes bright and 
narrow. 

Quay whistled. “Even at ten, at 
the wage we’re paying—-” 

“Never settle for quarters or 
thirds,” Cutter said. “Get the whole 
thing. Send for Bolen. I want to 
talk to him. And in the meantime. 
Bob, this is such a goddamned sweet 
morning, what do you say we go 
to lunch early?” 

Quay blinked only once, which 
proved his adaptability. Cutter had 
just asked him to lunch, as though 
it were their habit to lunch to- 
gether regularly, when in reality, 

44 



Quay had never once gone to lunch 
with Cutter before. Quay was quite 
nonchalant, however, and he said, 
“Why, fine, George. I think that’s 
a good idea.” 

B olen appeared in Cutter’s 
office the next morning, smil- 
ing, his eyes darting quickly about 
Cutter’s desk and walls, so that 
Cutter felt for a moment, that 
showing Bolen anything as personal 
as his office, was a little like letting 
the man look into his brain. 

“Quay tells me you’ve set ten 
percent as the top efficiency in- 
crease we can count on, Bolen.” 
Cutter said it directly, to the point. 

Bolen smiled, examining Cutter’s 
hands and suit and eyes. “That’s 
right, Mr. Cutter.” 

“Why?” 

Bolen placed his small hands on 
his lap, looked at the tapered fin- 
gers, then up again at Cutter. He 
kept smiling. “It’s a matter of 
saturation.” 

“How in hell could ten percent 
more efficiency turn into satura- 
tion?” 

“Not ten percent more efficien- 
cy,” Bolen said quietly. “Ten per- 
cent effect on the individual who 
creates the efficiency. Ten percent 
effect of that which causes him to 
be ten percent more efficient.” 
Cutter snorted. “Whatever the 
hell that damned gimmick does, it 
creates confidence, drive, strength, 
doesn’t it? Isn't that what you 
said?” 

“Yes,” Bolen said politely. “Ap- 
proximately.” 

“Can you explain to me then, 
how ten percent more confidence 
in a man is saturation?” 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 



Boll'll studied what he was going 
to say carefully, smiling all the 
while. “Some men,'’ he said very 
slowly, “are difl’erent than others, 
Mr. Cutter. Some men will read 
to personality changes as ahriipt as 
this in different ways than others. 
You aren’t too concerned, are you, 
with what those changes might al- 
ready have done to any of the in- 
dividuals affected?” 

“Hell, no,” Cutter said loudly. 
“Why should I be? All I’m in- 
terested in is efficiency. Tell me 
about efficiency, and I’ll know what 
you’re talking about.” 

“All light,” Bolen said. “We have 
no way of knowing right now which 
men have been affected more than 
others. All we have is an average. 
The average right now is eight and 
nine-tenths percent. But perhaps 
you have some workers w'ho clo not 
react, because they really do not 
suffer the lacks or compulsions or 
inhibitioas that the Confidet is con- 
cerned with. Perhaps they arc w'ork- 
ing at top efficiency right now, and 
no amount of further subjection to 
the Confidet will change them.” 
“All right then,” Cutter .said 
cjuickly, “we’ll ferret that kind of 
deadwood out, and replace them!” 
“How will you know which are 
deadwood?” Bolen asked pleasant- 

ly- 

“Individual checks, of course!” 
Bolen shook his head, looking 
back at his tapering fingers. “It 
won’t necessarily work. You see, 
the work that these men are con- 
cerned with is not particularly de- 
manding work, is it? And that 
means you want to strike a balance 
between capability and demand. 
It’s the unbalance of the.se things 
that creates trouble, and in your

“Cood,” Cuiiri -..lid ".-\nv man

Bolen .shook his head. “Nu. lb 'll 
react quite the other way. lie’ll Iom- 
interest, because the woik will no 
longer be a challenge, and ilicn iln- 
efficiency will drop.” 

Cutter’s Jaw hardened. “.-Ml righi 
then, ril move that man up, and 
fill his place with someone else,” 
Bolen looked at Cutter’s eyes, 
examined them curiously. “Some 
men ha\’c a great deal of latent 
talent, Mr. Cutter. This talent le- 
leased — ” 

Cutter frowned, studying Bolen 
carefully. Then he laughed sudden- 
ly. “You think I might not be able 
to handle it?” 

“Well, let’s say that you’ve got 
a stable of gentle, quiet marcs, and 
you turn (hem suddenly into tbor- 
ougbbreds. You have to make al- 
lowances for that, Mr. Cutler. The 
same stalls, the same railings, the 
same stable boys might not be able 
to do the job anymore.” 

“Yes,” Cutter said, smiling with- 
out humor, “but the oiuner has 
nothing to do with stalls and rail- 
ings and stable boys, only in (be 
sense that they are subsidiary. The 
owner is the owner, and if lie ha.s 
to make a few sulrsidiary cliang<‘s, 
all right. But nothing really affects 
the owner, no matter whether 
you’ve got gentle marcs or thor- 

45 




oughbreds.” 

Bolen nodded, as though he had 
expected that exact answer. “You 
are a very certain man, aren’t you, 
Mr. Cutter?” 

“Would 1 be here, in this office, 
heading this company, if I weren’t, 
Bolen?” 

Bolen smiled. 

Cutter straightened in his chair. 
“All right, do we go on? Do we 
shoot for the limit?” 

Bolen chose his words carefully. 
“I am interested in testing my Con- 
fidet, Mr. Cutter. This is the most 
important thing in the world to me. 
I don’t recommend what you want 
to do. But, as long as you’ll give 
me accurate reports on the effects 
of the Confidet, I’ll go along with 
you. Providing you grant me one 
concession.” 

Cutter frowned. 

“I want our written contract 
dissolved.” 

Cutter reddened faintly. Nobody 
ever demanded anything of him 
and got it easily, but his mind 
turned over rapidly, judging the 
increase in efficiency, the increase 
in profits. He would not necessarily 
have to stop with administrative 
personnel. There were other de- 
partments, too, that could stand a 
little sharpening. Finally he 
nodded, reluctantly. “All right, 
Bolen.” 

Bolen smiled and left quickly, 
and Cutter stared at his desk for a 
moment, tense. Then, he relaxed 
and the hard sternness of his face 
softened a bit. He put his finger 
on his desk calendar, and looked at 
a date Lucile had circled for him. 
He grinned, and picked up the tele- 
phone, and dialed. 

“This is George H. Cutter,” he 

46 



said to the man who answered. “My 
wife’s birthday is next Saturday. 
Do you remember that antique desk 
I bought her last year? Good. Well, 
the truth is, she uses it all the time, 
so this year I’d like a good chair 
to match it. She’s just using an oc- 
casional chair right now, and . .” 



1 IKE EVERYTHING he gave 
* her, Mary liked his gift e.x- 
tremely well, and night after night, 
after the birthday, he came home 
to find her at the desk, using the 
chair, captaining her house and her 
servant staff. And the improvement 
was noticeable in her, almost from 
the first day. Within a month, he 
could detect a remarkable change, 
and for the first time, since they 
had been married, Mary gave a 
dinner for thirty people without 
crying just before it started. 

There were other changes. 
Quay brought in efficiency report 
after efficiency report, and by the 
end of three months, they had hit 
eighteen and seven-tenths percent 
increase. The administrative office 
was no longer the dull, listless place 
it had been; now it thrived and 
hummed like the shop below. Cut- 
ter could see the difference with 
his own eyes, and he could particu- 
larly see the differences in certain 
individuals. 

Brow'n and Kennedy showed re- 
markable improvement, but it was 
really Harry Linden who astonished 
Cutter. An individual check showed 
a sixty-percent increase by Linden, 
and there was a definite change in 
the man’s looks. He walked dif- 
ferently, with a quick, virile step, 
and the look of His face and eyes 
had become strong and alive. He

began appearing early in the morn- 
ing, ahead of the starting hour, and 
working late, and the only time he 
missed any work hours, was one 
afternoon, during whit h, Lueilc in- 
formed Cutter, he had appeared in 
court for his divorce trial. 

Within a iiionlh, Cutter had 
fired Stole and Lackter and Cirant, 
as department heads, and replaced 
them with Brown, Kennedy, and 
Linden. He had formulated plans 
for installation of tile Confidet.s in 
the drafting department and the 
supply depnitmeiit, ami already the 
profits of im:reasecl cfl'icicney were 
heginiiing to show in the naords. 
Cutter was full of new enthusiasm 
and ambition, and tliere was only 
one thorn in the entire develop- 
ment. 

Quay had resigned. 

Cutter had heori startled and 
extremely angry, but Quay had 
been unperturbed and stubborn. 
“Fve enjoyed working with you 
immensely, George, liut my mind 
is made up. No hard feelings:’” 

Cutter had not even shaken his 
hand. 

Jl had bothered him for days, 
and lie (.lieeked every industrial 
coin]Kiny ill th<’ area, to see where 
Quay had found a belter position. 
He was highly surprised, when he 
learned, finally, that Quay had 
purchased ;t small boat and was 
earning his livaiig by earr\ing fish- 
ermen out onto the Bay . Quay hatl 
also riiarried, lour days alter liis 
rc.signation. and Cutter pushed the 
entire thing out ol his mind, c lieck- 
ing it oH to p.irtial insanity. 

By February o) the iirxt year, lie 
had jiromoled Harry Linden to 
Quay’s old job. gotten rid of the 
deadwood that showed up so plain- 

CONFIDENCE GAME 



ly on the individual checks, and the 
total effieieney average had reached 
thirty-three percent. His and Mary’s 
anniversary was on the fourth of 
March, and when that day arrived, 
he was ca-rtaiii llial he had reached 
that point wheie lie lould expand 
to another plan!. 

He was aboul to order her a 
mink stole in celi-bration, but it was 
also that day that be was inlormed 
that she was suing him lor dicoree. 
He rushc'd home, furious, hiU site 
was gone. She had taken her clothes 
and jewelry and the second Cadil- 
lac. In fact, all that slic had left 
ol her personal possessions were the 
antic]ue dc'sk and chair. When the 
trial was over, months later, she 
had won enough support to take 
her to France, where, he learned, 
she ptirchased ;i chateau at Clannes. 

He tried to lose himself in lus 
work, but for the first time in his 
life, he had begun to get faintly 
worried. It was only a sliver of 
worrv. but it kept him from going 
on with the expansion. Stocks in 
the company had turned over at an 
ama/ingly rapid rate, and while it 
was still nothing more than intui- 
tion on his part, he began to tight- 
en u]j. readving himsell to meet 
anything. 

d'he e\|)!osioii came in July. 

Drindor Products had picked up 
forty-nine pereeiit of tlie stock on 
the market, by using secondary 
buvers. T here liad lieen a leak 
soniecvhere. Cutter realized, that 
had told his (cniipctitor, Drindor, 
the kind of profit he was making. 
He knew wlio it had been instantly, 
but belorr he could tire Harry 
Linden, all of his walls crash(,‘d 
down. Four months before, to put 
more esprit de corps into Linden, 

47 



he had allowed Linden eight shares 
of his own stock, intending to pick 
it up later from the market. Linden 
had coerced with Drindor. Cutter 
lost control. 

A board of directors was elected 
by Drindor, and Drindor assumed 
the presidency by proxy. Harry Lin- 
den took over Cutter’s office, as 
Vice President In Charge. 

Cutter had wildly ordered Ed- 
ward Bolen to remove the Confidets 
one week before, but even then he 
had known that it was too late, and 
the smiling, knowing look on 
Bolen’s face had infuriated him to 
a screaming rage. Bolen remained 
undisturbed, and C|uietly carried 
the disks away. Cutter, when he 
left his office that final day, moved 
slowly, very slowly. 

H e brooded for many long 
days after that, searching his 
mind for a way to counterattack. 
He still had enough stock to keep 
him comfortable if he lived another 
hundred years. But he no longer 
had the power, and he thirsted for 
that. He turned it around and 
around in his brain, trying to figure 
out how he could do it, and the one 
thing he finally knew, the one cer- 
tain thing, was that if he used 
enough drive, enough strength, then 
he would regain control of the com- 
pany he had built with his own 
hands and mind. 

He paced the library and the 
long living room and the dining 
room, and his eyes were lost, until 
he saw, through the doorway of the 
sewing room, that desk and that 
chair, and he remembered he 
hadn’t done anything about that. 
He paused only briefly, because 

48 



he had not lost an ounce of his 
ability to make a sudden decision, 
and then he removed that disk and 
carried it to the library and fitted it 
under the cushion of the large, 
worn, leather chair. 

By fall, he had done nothing to 
regain control, and he was less 
certain of how he should act than 
he had been months before. He 
kept driving by the plant and look- 
ing at it, but he did so carefully, .so 
that no one would see him, and he 
was surprised to find that, above 
all, he didn’t want to face Harry 
Linden. The memory of the man’s 
firm look, the sharjj, bold eyes, 
frightened him, and tlie knowledge 
of his fright crushed him inside. He 
wished desperately that Mary were 
back with him, and he even wrote 
her letters, pleading letters, but they 
came back, unopened. 

Finally he went to see Robert 
Quay, because Quay was the only 
man in bis memory whom he some- 
how didn’t fear talking to. He 
found Quay in a small cottage near 
the beach. There was a six-day old 
infant in a crib in the bedroom, 
and Quay’s wife was a sparkling- 
eyed girl with a smile that made 
Cutter feel relatively at ease for the 
first time in weeks. 

She politely left them alone, and 
Cutter sal there, embarrassed faint- 
ly, but glad to be in Quay’s home 
and presence. They talked of how 
it had been, when Quay was with 
the company, and finally Cutter 
pushed himself into asking about 
it: 

“I’ve often wondered. Bob, why 
you left?” 

Quay blushed slightly, then 
grinned. “I might as well admit it. 

JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 




I got one of those things from 
Bolen, and had it installed in my 
own chair.” 

Cutter thought about it, sur- 
prised. He cleared his throat. “And 
then you quit?” 

“Sure,” Quay said. “All my life. 
I’d wanted to do just what I’m do- 
ing. But things ju.st came easy to 
me, and the opportunities were al- 
ways there, and I just never had 
the guts to pass anything by. Final- 
ly I did.” 

Quay smiled at him, and Cutter 
shifted in his chair. “The Confidet 
did that.” 

Cutter nodded. 

It came to him suddenly, some- 
thing he'd never suspected until 
that moment. There was something 
very definitely wrong with what had 
happened to him. The Confidet 
had effected everyone but him; 
there must have boon something 
wrong wiili the one he had been 
using. It had worked with Mary, 
but hadn’t Bolen said something 
about the energy being used in 
proportion to the demand? Mary 
had certainly created a demand. 
Bolen said the life of it was in- 
definite, but couldn’t the energy 
have been usi'd up? 

“Ah,” he said carefully, smiling, 
to Quay. “You wouldn’t have it 
around, would you? That Confidet 
of yours?” 

“Oh, hell, no,” Quay said. “I 
gave it to Bolen a long time ago. 
He came around for it, in fact. 
Said he had to keep track of all of 
them.” 

Cutter left hurriedly, with Quay 
and his wife following him to his 
car. He drove straight to Bolen’s 
house. 

Fury built inside of him. All this 

CONFIDENCE GAME 



time, Bolen had kept track of his 
Confidet, the one that Mary had 
u.sed, and all this time, he had 
known Cutter still had it. Cutter 
was furious over the realization that 
Bolen had been using him for ex- 
perimentation. and .dso because the 
Confidet that he h.id tried to use 
had turned worthless. 

All his hatred, all his anger 
churned inside of liini like the 
heat from shaken coal', but when 
he walked up the p.iih to Bolen’s 
small house, he did so c|uii tly, with 
extreme care. 

When he saw Bolen’s face in the 
doorway, he wanteil to strike the 
man, but he kept his hands quietly 
at his sides; and though he hated 
himself for it, he e\cn .smiled a 
little at the man. 

“Come in,” Bolim smiled, and 
he spoke softly, and at the same 
time he examined Cutter with 
quick, penetrating eye'. "Come in, 
Mr. Cutter.” 

Cutter wanted to stand there and 
demand another Confidet, a good 
one, and not walk inside, politely, 
like he did. And he wished that his 
voice would come out, quickly, with 
the power and hate in it diat he 
had once been capable of. But for 
some reason, he couldn't say a 
word. 

Bolen was e.xtremely polite. 
“You’ve been using that Confidet, 
haven’t you?” He spoke gently, al- 
most as though he were speaking 
to a frightened child. 

“Yes,” Cutter managed to say. 

“And what you expected to hap- 
pen, didn’t. That’s what you want 
to tell me, isn’t it?” 

Cutter’s insides quivered widi 
rage, but he was able only to nod. 

“Would you like to know why?” 

49 



Bolen said. 

Cutter rubbed his damp palms 
over his knees. He nodded. 

Bolen smiled, his eyes sparkling. 
“Very simple really. It wasn’t the 
fault of the Confidet so much, Mr. 
Cutter, as you. You see, you arc a 
rare exception. What you arc, or 
possibly I should say, what you 
were, was a complete super ego. 
There are very few of those, Mr. 
Cutter, in this world, but you hap- 
pened to be one of them. A really 
absolute, complete super ego, and 
the Confidet’s cITect was simply the 
reverse of what it would have been 
with anyone else.” Bolen shook his 
head, sympathetically, but he didn’t 
stop smiling, and his eyes didn’t 
stop their infuriating exploration 
of Cutter’s face and eyes and hands. 
“It’s really a shame, because I vvas 
almost certain you were a super 
ego, Mr. Cutter. And when you 



didn’t return that last Confidet, I 
somehow felt that you might use 
it, after all that nasty business at 
the company and all. 

“But while I was fairly certain of 
the effects, Mr. Cutter, I wasn’t 
absolutely sure, you see, and so like 
the rest of the experiments, I had 
to forget my conscience. I’m really 
very sorry.” 

The anger was a wild thirrg in- 
side Cutter now, and it made his 
hands tremble and sweat, and his 
mouth quiver, and he hated the 
man in front of him, the man who 
was responsible for what had hap- 
pened to him, the smiling man with 
the soft voice and exploring eyes. 
But he didn’t say anything, not a 
word. He didn’t show his anger or 
his frustration or his resentment. He 
didn’t indicate to Bolen a particle 
of his inner wildness. 

He didn’t have the nerve. • • • 



WORTH CITING 

The story of a woman patient who allowed doctors to graft living 
cancer cells under her skin was recently disclosed at a meeting of the 
American College of Surgeons. Hopelessly ill with a widespread cancer, 
she let doctors at Memorial Hospital in New York City operate to re- 
move cancerous tissue for culture in laboratory animals and in test tubes. 
Several months later the doctors back-transplanted these cultured cells 
under her skin. They jjrcw actively, and when removed a second time for 
microscopic examination they proved to be identical with the cancer 
cells that had been removed in the original operation. 

Scientists who have struggled to control this killer disease have long 
been hampered by the fact that they must always work with mouse or 
rat cancers, or cells that have been cultivated outside the human body. 
Now, thanks to this heroic woman patient, science knows that the cells 
which have been cultivated outside the Ixidy are really human cancer 
cells, and drugs which work on these cells in test tubes are working on 
human cancer and can be used on patients with greater confidence. 

Nameless though she is, our Citation this month goes to this woman 
who pioneered so bravely in her desire to “be useful to humanity.”

THE BATTLE 



It was the Last Battle. The cavalry was ready. The air arm 
was ready. The troops were ready. Metal shining, 
relays renewed, energy reservoirs charged. Television for 
the world was ready . Was there anything not ready? 



BY ROBERT SHECKLEY

S UPREME Grncral fettercr 
barki'd “At case!” as he hur- 
lii'd into the toiiunand room. 
Obediently, his three generals stood 
at ease. 

“We haven’t much time," Fet- 
terer said, glancing at his watch. 
“We’ll go over the plan of battle 
again.” 

Fie walked to the wall and un- 
rolled a gigantic map of the Sahara 
desert. 

“According to our best theologi- 
cal information, Satan is going to 
present his forces at these coordi- 
nates.” FIc indicated the place with 
a blunt forefinger. “In the front 
rank there will be the deviks, de- 
mons, succubi, incubi, and die rest 
of the ratings. Bael will command 
the right flank, Bucr the left. His 
Satanic Majesty will hold the cen- 
ter.” 



“Rather medieval,” General Dell 
inuimured. 

General Fettercr's aide came in. 
his face shining and happy with 
thought of the Coming. 

“.Sir,” he said, “The prie.st is out- 
side again.” 

“Stand at attention, soldier,” 
Fetterer said sternly. “I'here’s still 
a battle to be fought and won.” 

“Yes sir," the aide .said, and 
stot)d rigidly, some of the joy fad- 
ing from his face. 

“The priest, ch?” Supreme Gen- 
eral Fetterer rubbed his fingers to- 
gether thoughtfully. Even since the 
Coining, since the knowledge of the 
imminent Last Battle, the religious 
workers of the world had made a 
complete nuisance of them.selves. 
They had stopped their bickering, 
which was commendable. But now 
they were trying to run military 

53 



business. 

“Send him away,” Fetterer said. 
“He knows we’re planning Arma- 
geddon.” 

“Yes sir,” the aide said. He 
saluted sharply, wheeled, and 
marched out. 

“To go on,” Supreme General 
Fetterer said. “Behind Satan’s first 
line of defense will be the resur- 
rected sinners, and various elemen- 
tal forces of evil. The fallen angels 
will act as his bomber corps. Dell’s 
robot interceptors will meet them.” 

General Dell smiled grimly. 

“Upon contact, MacFec’s auto- 
matic tank corps will proceed to- 
ward the center of the line. Mac- 
Fee’s automatic tank corps will 
proceed toward the center,” Fet- 
terer went on, “supported by Gen- 
eral Ongin’s robot infantry. Dell 
will command the H bombing of 
the rear, which should be tightly 
massed. I will thrust with the 
mechanized cavalry, here and 
here.” 

The aide came back, and stood 
rigidly at attention. “Sir,” he said, 
“The priest refuses to go. He says 
he must speak with you.” 

Supreme General Fetterer hesi- 
tated before saying no. He remem- 
bered that this was the Last Battle, 
and that the religious workers ivere 
connected with it. He decided to 
give the man five minutes. 

“Show him in,” he said. 

The priest wore a plain business 
suit, to show that he represented 
no particular religion. His face was 
tired but determined. 

“General,” he said, “I am a rep- 
resentative of all the religious work- 
ers of the world, the priests, rabbis, 
ministers, mullahs, and all the rest. 
We beg of you, General, to let us 

54 



fight in the Lord’s battle.” 

Supreme General Fetterer 
drummed his fingers nervously 
against his side. He wanted to stay 
on friendly terms with these men. 
Even he, the Supreme Com- 
mander, might need a good word, 
when all was said and done. 

“You can understand my posi- 
tion,” Fetterer said unhappily. “I’m 
a general. I have a battle to fight.” 

“But it’s the Last Battle,” the 
priest said. “It should be the 
people’s battle.” 

“It is,” Fetterer said. “It’s being 
fought by their representatises, the 
military.” 

The priest didn’t look at all con- 
vinced. 

Fetterer said. “You wouldn’t 
want to lose this battle, would you? 
Have Satan win?” 

“Of course not,” the priest mur- 
mured. 

“Then we can’t take any 
chances,” Fetterer said. “All the 
governments agreed on that, didn’t 
they? Oh, it would be very nice to 
fight Armageddon with the mass 
of humanity. Symbolic, you might 
say. But could we be certain of 
victory?” 

The priest tried to say some- 
thing, but Fetterer was talking 
rapidly. 

“How do we know the strength 
of Sattm’s forces? We simply must 
put forth our best foot, militarily 
.speaking. And that means the auto- 
matic armies, the robot intercep- 
tors and tanks, the H bombs.” 

The priest looked very unhappy. 
“But it isn't right/’ he said. “Cer- 
tainly you can find some place in 
your plan for people?” 

Fetterer thought about it, but 
the request was impossible. The 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 




plan of battle was fully developed, 
beautiful, irresistible. Any intro- 
duction of a gross human element 
would only throw it out of order. 
No living flesh could stand the 
noise of that mechanical attack, 
the energy potentials humming in 
the air, the ail-enveloping fire 
power. .A. humati being who came 
within a hundred miles of the 
front would not live to see the 
enemy. 

“I'm afraid not,” Fettcrer said. 

“There aie some,” the priest 
said sternly, “who feci that it was 
an error to put this in the hands 
of the military.” 

“Sorry.” Fettcrer said cheerfully. 
“That’s defeatist talk. If you don’t 
mind — ” Me gestured at the door. 
Wearily, the priest left. 

“These civilians,” Fettcrer 
mused. “Well, gentlemen, arc your 
troops ready?” 

“We’re ready to fight for Him,” 
General MacFee said enthusiasti- 
cally. “I can vouch for every auto- 
matic in my command. 'I'hcir metal 
is shining, all relays have been re- 
newed, and the energy reservoirs 
arc fully cliarged. Sir, tliey’re posi- 
tively itching for battle!” 

G(‘neral Origin snapped fully out 
of bis daze. “The ground troops are 
ready, sir!” 

“Air arm ready,” General Dell 
said. 

“Excellent,” General Fettcrer 
said. “All other arrangements have 
been made. Television facilities are 
available for the total population 
of the world. No one, rich or poor, 
will miss the spectacle of the Last 
Battle.” 

“And after the battle — ” General 
Ongin began, and stopped. He 
looked at Fettcrer. 



Fettcrer frowned deeply. He 
didn’t know what was supjrosed to 
happen after The Battle. 'I'hat part 
of it \\’as jrrcsumably, in the hands 
of the religinus agencies. 

“I suppoM' ihrre’ll he a presenta- 
tion or something," he said vague- 

'y- 

“You mi-an we will meet — 
Him?” Gemial Dell asked. 

“Don’t really kiinvv,” Fcllcn-r 
said. “But I should think so. Alter 
all — I mean, you know wli.ii 1 
mean.” 

“But what should we wear?' 
General AlacFec asked, in a suil- 
cicn panic. “1 mean, what does one 
wear?” 

“What do the angels wetir?” 
Fettcrer asked Ongin. 

“1 don’t know,” Ongin said. 

“Rotics, do you think?” General 
Dell oli'ered. 

“No,” Fetlerer stiid sternly. “We 
will wear dress uniform, without 
decorations.” 

Till' generals nodded. It was fit- 
ting. 

And then it was time. 



G orgeous in their battle 

tirray, the legions of Hell ad- 
vanced o\ei the desert. Hellish 
j)ipes skirled, hollow drums 
pounded, and the great ghost 
moved loruard. 

In a blinding cloud of sand. 
General Mael'ee's automalie tanks 
hurled themselves against the Sa- 
tanic foe. Immediately, Dell’s 
automatic bnrnirers screeched over- 
head, liurlitig their bomirs on the 
inas.sed horde of the daiimed. Fet- 
terer thrust s'aliantly ^v■ith his auto- 
matic calvalry. 

Into this melee advanced On-

THE BATTLE 



gin’s automatic infantry, and metal 
did- what metal could. 

The hordes of the damned over- 
flowed the front, ripping apart 
tanks and robots. Automatic mcch- 
anisins died, bravely defending a 
patch of sand. Dell's bombers were 
torn from the skies by tile fallen 
angels, led by Marchodas, his grif- 
fin’s wings beating the air into a 
tornado. 

The thin, battered line of robots 
held, against gigantic presences 
that smashed and scattered tliem, 
and struck terror into the hearts 
of television viewers in homes 
around the world. Like men, like 
hero<-s the robots fought, trying to 
force back the forces of evil. 

Astaroth shrieked a command, 
and Bi’hemoth lumbered forwaid. 
Bael, with a wedge of devils be- 
hind him, threw a charge at Gen- 
eral Fetterer’s crumbling left 
flank. Metal screamed, electrons 
howled in agony at the impact. 

Supreme General Fettcrer 
sweated and trembled, a thousand 
miles Ix'-hind the firing line. But 
steadily, nervelessly, he guided the 
pushing of buttons and the throw- 
ing of levers. 

His superb corps didn’t disap- 
point him. Mortally damaged ro- 
bots swayed to their feet and 
fought. Smashed, trampled, de- 
stroyed by the howling fiends, the 
robots managed to hold their line. 
Then the veteran Fifth Corps 
threw in a counterattack, and the 
enemy front was pierced. 

A thousand miles behind the fir- 
ing line, the generals guided die 
mopping up operations, 

“The battle is won,” Supreme 
General Fetterer whispered, turn- 
ing away from the television screen. 

56 



“I congratulate you, gentlemen.” 

The generals smiled wearily. 

Thev looked at eadi other, then 
broke into a spontaneous shout. 
.Armageddon was won. and the 
forces of Satan had been van- 
quished. 

But something was happening on 
their .screens. 

“Is that — is that — ” General 
Mac Fee Ix-gan, and then couldn't 
speak. 

For The Presence was upon the 
battlefield, walking among the piles 
of twisted, shattered metal. 

The generals were silent. 

The Presence touched a twisted 
robot. 

L'p>on the smoking desert, the 
robots began to move. The twisted, 
scored, fused metals straightened. 

The robots stood on their feet 
again. 

"Mac Fee,” Supreme General 

Fetterer whispered. "Try your con- 
trols. Make the robots kneel or 
something.” 

The general tried, but his con- 
trols were dead. 

'file bodies of the robots began 
to rise in the air. .Around them 
were the angels of the Lord, and 
die robot tanks and soldiers and 
bombers floated upward, higher 
and higher. 

“He’s saving them!"’ Ongin cried 
hysterically. “He’s saving the ro- 
bots!” 

“It’s a mistake!'’ Fetterer said. 
“Quick. Send a messenger to — no! 
We will go in person!” 

And (juickly a ship was com- 
manded, and quickly diey sped to 
the field ol battle. But by then it 
was too late, for Armageddon was 
over, and die robots gone, and the 
Lord and his host departed. • • •

World Without War 



Cooperation was all right back in the dark ages but this was 
an era of super culture and hi-psi intelligence. 

And love was no laughing matter. People who cooperated, 
even biologically, were unlawful and . 



ARK KNEW he shouldn’t 
stop. He was already late for 
Jcnnette’s birthday party, but the 
sight of three people out in the 
open like this was too much. 

He pulled around and hovered 
over the undulating flow of glassy 
magma, frozen on its way to the 
long, dry Potomac river bed, with 
its shallow caverns and fascinating 
mile-wide potholes. Just under an 
overhanging clilT' of half-vitrified 
soil were two cars, obviously dam- 
aged. The three men were standing 
beside them. 

Mark laughed out loud. It was 
not often that one found three 
people at once. And so close to each 
other. The scene there, with the 



long, slanting rays of milky sunlight 
glancing off the ribbing of the flats 
and sparkling through the million 
brittle shards of collapsed debris, 
filled him with a certain poetic ex- 
ultation. 

“By the stars,” he murmured to 
himself happily. 

Bubbling with good humor, he 
slipped down a little closer to the 
hole, staying up hard against the 
overhanging clilT. He was feeling 
too cheerful to use his rightful ad- 
vantage over them, and decided to 
use a handgun, since they had 
nothing better. 

This was a mistake, of course. 
He was only moving along at a 
hundred miles an hour now. Too

slow for safe shooting, particularly 
witlt llic bumpy air in the hole. But 
he ha])pily di'-rcg.iidi-il this, as he 
pushed o|X'n a view poi t and blazed 
away with a zuzz pistol. 

••MnKKt immediately tlic ship

Mark euiN< d mildly, some of his 
high good humor gone, and pulled 
the car ahoui for another run. 'I’he

him, nniifuing him that he was 
now a full hour late for Ji'nnette’s 
birthday party, but the code re- 
<(uiied the siaoml try.

broad-beam, burning a red flare of 
gi-neral destiuetion at him. 

Mark veered around and bore 
down sli.irplv foi' the last burst. He

foloied fire and fell, with Mark 
burning inside of it, yelling and 
screaming in pain. 

It took almost five seconds before 




59 




tlic charntl brain of Mark’s body 
.sto|3iK’d fimclioning. Then it re- 
leas'd liiin. 

He was conscious of the hum- 
iiiiiig Ilf liis transmitter. Almo.st 
iimiiedi.itely the remembered pain 
l)rought [rerspiration running down 
inside the helmet into his eyes. He 
reached up and removed the head- 
piece with unsteady hands, groan- 
ing softly. 

it had been some decades since 
he had last been involved in trou- 
ble like this. Killed, yes — but in a 
painless, fair fight. Being burned 
to death was no joke. And that body 
had been one of his best, with the 
finest reflex sensory systsm manu- 
factured. 

The machine purred softly beside 
him. He thought suddenly and 
emptily of jennette, and stood up. 

“Damn,” he muttered, crossing 
the floor, feeling the pleasant 
warmth of the soft plastic under his 
feet. “Damn, damn, damn.” He 
stopped before the transparent cov- 
er of a storage cabinet, gazing sour- 
ly at its contents. 

Eleven humanoid forms were 
stiffly erect behind the cover, all 
broadly resembling him in feature, 
and differing only in such minor 
things as height, hair, perhaps the 
color of the eyes. Each bore the 
scars of some past clumsiness or 
accident. 

“Damn,” Mark said again. “That 
was the only decent body I had to 
wear. Now what do 1 do?” 

He went into the next room and 
bathed himself in the tepid per- 
fumed mist that fell perpetually 
from its domed ceiling. If it were 
anybody but Jennette, there would 
be no problem. He just would have 

60 



to .shoot off a quick RT, explaining 
the situation and excusing himself. 
Nobody would have minded, least 
of all himself. Particularly a no- 
fight affair like this one was sup- 
posed to be. 

But not Jennette. Olihh, Jen- 
nette. 

Mark grinned and rubbed the 
pleasant fluid over his well-cared- 
for skin. Oh yes, Jennette. There 
was something about Jennette that 
he could not quite put his finger on, 
but it was good. It was wonderous- 
ly good. Like the bodies she wore. 
No matter what it was, it was al- 
ways perfect. She just had the 
knack of dressing well. 

Idly he wondered what her pro- 
tobody was like. There must be 
some resemblance, of course. That 
was the law. Identification was very 
important, and few manufacturers 
would violate that, even as a sim- 
ple matter of good taste. But there 
still would be considerable differ- 
ence. 

As he thought about it, he got a 
strange wistful feeling that he did 
not quite understand. There was a 
sort of sadne.ss about it. Jennette 
seemed oddly different from other 
people. He liked her much too 
much. 

Guiltily he brushed the thoughts 
aside. Anyway, it didn’t matter, he 
told himself. Due to his carelessness 
in that last fight, he probably 
wouldn’t even see her tonight, since 
he had nothing to wear. 

He stalked out of the shower and 
gazed again at the bodies in the 
store room. The only halfway de- 
cent one there was that six foot 
black fellow with the little ears. It 
used to be his favorite, until he 
got it smashed one night during a 

E. G. VON WALD 




party at his nearest neighbor’s. A 
lialf smile tugged at Mark’s lips 
as he recalled the incident. That 
had been a no-fight parly, too; but 
he had managed to smuggle in a 
small bomb, and set it ofi' right in 
the middle of the main bedroom. 
There were at least ten couples 
there, since it was a big party, and 
none of them lived. The trouble 
was, Mark had been pretty badly 
smashed up him.self, and just man- 
aged to get away without losing 
his body. 

Now the thing was all scarred up 
and practically useless for anything 
e.xcept manual labor. 

Mark shook his head disgustedly. 
There was nothing to do but send 
off the RT to Jennette. 

But this was her birthday — 

He caught a glimpse of himself 
in the reflection from his transmit- 
ter housing and automatically 
straightened his shoulders a little, 
then laughed at his image. 

Then he stopped and contem- 
plated himself further. There was 
one thing he could do. Many years 
before, he had an e.xacl duplicate of 
himself produced, when the vogue 
for copper colored bodies was at 
its height. Since then lire fasliion 
had changed back to the pink, but 
that old job must still be around 
somewhere. 

He hated to do it, though. He 
had never liked that body. It had 
been just too accurate, and every 
time he wore it, it embarrassed him. 
It had been almost as if he were 
going outside in his protobody. 
Which, of course, nobody did. Peo- 
ple used their own bodies hundreds 
of years ago, but it was most un- 
civilized. Besides, it was tiring, and 
dangerous, too. Yet — was it more 

WORLD WITHOUT WAR 



fun? He wondered. 

He simply had to make Jennette’s 
])aity. Olhcrwi.se he wouldn’t see 
her for months at least, and the 
ihouglit of that made him feel fun- 
ny in his stomai li. 

M.iik giinmil again, admiring 
her image in his mind, and set 
about his t .il.ilogue to find the 
fund.uncnl.il fici|iicncy of that old 
copy ol bim.scli. I'kise it, he told 
liiniself resolutely. Nobody would 
know it was an cx.ict dupliiate. 

lie loiateil the il.ita and set It 
ujj in the transiniltcr. lie had no 
idea wheie the body was, but that 
would take care of it.sclf if it were 
still in good shaiJc. Placing the hel- 
met on his head, he punched the 
controls and relaxed back on the 
table. 



T WO LEVELS below, under a 
pile of dust-covered trash, the 
body became suddenly conscious. 
Mark opened his eyes and looked 
around, recognition slowly return- 
ing. He had forgotten all about 
this old room, but tlien- — one could 
hardly remember everything about 
a full shelter system, what with the 
hundreds of compartments, endless 
automatic ct^uipment and innumer- 
able connecting passages. Whoever 
it was who built this one sure had 
liked comple.xity. 

He bathed and carefully braided 
tire long, blueblack hair, simulating 
somewhat the fashion of the day, 
and spent some time adjusting a 
purple scarf over his left shoulder. 
The purple scarf was sort of a trade 
mark witli him, and Jennette al- 
ways admired it. Purple was her 
favorite color. He made a joke out 
of it and called it Their color, 

61 



which was typical of the strange, 
dangerous behavior she engendered 
in him. 

Mark was a little worried as he 
plunged up toward tlie stratosphere 
in his extra car. This time he kept 
clearly in his mind the fact that 
this was his last serviceable body, 
and he could take no chances with 
it getting ruined. Even if he saw a 
whole multitude of people, all clus- 
tered together, he would ignore 
them, he told himself. 

Halfway there, however, he 
spotted a peculiar marking on the 
scope, and detoured. The peculiar 
marking followed him. 

Anxiously, he looked out a clear 
view panel, but could see nothing 
in the cold, mist-laden night. The 
marking grew more definite as he 
hesitated. It was another car, and 
there could be no question what it 
was after. A shot at Mark. 

He cursed and sucked in his 
breath, making quick calculations. 
There was a rolling billow of cobalt 
fog off to one side, a whole bank 
of the stuff. Somebody apparently 
had been having a little game near- 
by. It was still hot enough, ac- 
cording to his indicators, to dis- 
charge anything the other car sent 
after him, and he would have the 
added advantage of being invisible 
to tlie other man’s instruments. The 
only trouble was, once in the fog, 
he couldn’t see anything either, 
and could be ambushed without 
difficulty on the way out. 

The marking on the scope be- 
came more definite, and the ques- 
tion settled itself as the other car 
came between Mark and the cloud. 
Growling with irritation, Mark 
swung around and sent a wide 
angle beam in the direction of his 

62 



pursuer, watching nervously as the 
indicators described the pitiful short 
range of his fire at this setting. 

The assailant veered off, how- 
ever, scurrying into the cobalt 
cloud. Mark grinned. He knew the 
man would expect him to wait for 
him to come out, so he swooped 
down at max acceleration toward 
the surface. In five minutes he was 
signaling into Jennette’s shelter for 
permi.ssion to enter. 

There were servants everywhere 
— mechanical things, controlled by 
electronics and not alive, although 
they looked it. This was jennette's 
specialty. She owned a factory that 
manufactured them for mining on 
the scalding plains of Mercury, and 
these had been superficially re- 
modelled to act as .servants. There 
was the usual government man 
there, too, running the party. He 
strutted around under his official 
sash with ill-concealed self-im- 
portance. 

“Hey you, there — w'ait a min- 
ute,” he called to Mark, waving a 
zuzz pistol in his direction. 

“Yes?” Mark hesitated, eyed the 
pistol, and obeyed. 

“That scarf — get it off,” the man 
ordered sternly as he approached. 
The zuzz pistol was level and 
steady. 

“Why?” Mark demanded. “It’s 
just a scarf. I always wear one.” 

“You know why,” the other man 
said coldly. “This is a tetotal party. 
If I let somebody slip a weapon or 
something in, it would be an awful 
brawl in no time. You know how 
people are.” 

The man was right, of course. 
You can conceal a lot of things in 
the fabric of a sheer scarf. Reluc- 
tantly, Mark undid the catch and 

E. G. VON WALD 




handed it over. 

“Okay. You can pick it up at the 
entrance when you leave.” The 
officer’s amused eyes wrinkled as 
he looked Mark up and down. 
“Say, that’s a pretty nice job you’ve 
got there, man. Mind if I ask who 
made it?” 

“It’s pretty good,” Mark said 
cautiously. “It’s custom made to a 
private specification.” 

The officer grinned goodnatured- 
ly. “Sure, I understand. That’s all 
right. I’m not from the revenue 
department. I don’t have to do 
anything about bootlegging.” 

“I don't mean that.” Mark pro- 
tested. “There’s nothing illegal—” 
The man waved his disregard 
anyway. “Forget it. It’s a nice one, 
though, .^nd that cop]3cr color is 
coming back soon, too. These 
fashions run in cycles, you know.” 
“Yes,” Mark murmured diffi- 
dently. ’T thought so, too.” 

“Sure.” The officer eyed it specu- 
latively for a moment. “Two point 
oh one centimeter naval, isn’t it? 
They’re the best, of cour.se.” Mark 
nodded shortly, looking away from 
the talk.itive officer, hoping he 
would stop. But the man went on. 
“And I don’t have any use for 
these new non-feeders they’ve been 
coming out with recently.” 

“No,” Mark mumbled. 

“It’s all right to fix it so that the 
food is not necessaiy, and it really 
is a bother to have to feed those old 
models whether you want to or not. 
But sometimes you like to eat some- 
thing just for the fun of it, and 
with the non-feeder models there’s 
no receptacle for it.” 

Mark nodded, his eyes searching 
the huge anteroom, gazing hope- 
fully between die moving ranks of 

WORLD WITHOUT WAR 



robot servants. Then he saw her 
and caught his breath. 

EN.YETTK. His lips formed a 
low whi.sile in time-honored ac- 
clamation tif exi clleiue. The offi- 
cer followed his g.r/e and agreed. 

“Yes,” he s.iid in a low voice, 
“that girl is really Munething. Pri- 
vate spec for evil ylliing, ami she 
sure knows how tci use it. Take that 
little golden job she’s wearing to- 
night. Nothing to it. But with her, 
it’s tei rifle.” 

He uas right. Jennettc was wear- 
ing a slender, soft-looking golden 
little boily that Mark had nc\’er 
seen before. But it was a real prize. 
Being hoste.ss, she could have 
clothes on, and spoi ted a half dozen 
little bracelets and a jet black 
bandana around her throat. The 
thing was draped down o\er her 
left Itrc.ist, and the whole etlect was 
really Cjuite stunning. 

“Oh Mark!” she exclaimed, run- 
ning up with an odd sort of breath- 
lessness. “\’mrre late." 

“Sony Jennette," he replied. 
“Ran into a little trouble and had 
to go back for another body.’’ 

“You must h;i\'e missed,” she said 
with amused ticcusation. “I’m sur- 
prised ;it you. 

“.\w, there were three of them,” 
he protested. “.\nd the last one 
used a broad betmi.” 

“Never mind, I forgive you,” she 
told him. “Gome along. Let's go 
look at my garden.” 

Mark grinned hap])ily. “Wonder- 
ful ideti. But what about your 
guests? Are you just going to leave 
them like tlKil?" 

"I'his is my birthday,” she said. 
“They can amuse themselves.” 

63 



Then she pulled him down and put 
her lips to his ear. “Besides,” she 
whispered. “I’ve got an identical 
copy with electronic works. No 
one will even know I’ve left, unless 
they get too friendly with it.’’ 

"Pretty clever,” Mark admitted 
thoughtfully. “But I wouldn’t al- 
ways be so ready to break the law 
like that.” 

“Who’s to know except you, 
Mark?” She looked up at him 
with burning, gold-flecked eyes. 
“You wouldn’t tell anybody, would 
you?” 

Mark shook his head uncom- 
fortably. 

“All right, then.” 

They entered the elevator that 
took them down another half mile 
to the central living quarters of the 
ancient shelter. It had been built 
early in the flux period and re- 
modelled several tiimts. It was one 
of the best equipped on the planet. 

“Tell me,” Jennette said, gazing 
appreciatively at the heavy bronze 
shoulders, “where on earth did you 
get that?” 

“I — Oh, it was just lying around 
somewhere,” Mark mumbled. 

“I bet,” she said. “But it’s nice. I 
like it.” 

Mark just grinned at her, happy 
for the moment, secure in the 
knowledge that it would be impossi- 
ble for her ever to know that it was 
really identical with his protobody. 
Not that it would matter, just so 
long as it was artificial. He listened 
to the humming of the elevator for 
a few minutes. When it stopped the 
door vanished, and the two of them 
moved out into a sea of wild, 
colorful beauty. High above them 
was a simulated sun that made as 
good a substitute for the real thing 

64 



as had been developed since the 
underground movement. 

“Bright,” Mark commented. 

“Oh, that’s right. I’ve been forc- 
ing some Venerian puffers and 
scent flowers, and raised the radia- 
tion level ten decibels. They always 
do well under a strong sun, you 
know.” She left his arm and moved 
to a control panel beside the en- 
trance to the elevator. She manipu- 
lated something and the sun 
dimmed a little. “There,” she 
turned around. “Better?” 

Mark looked at the landscape, 
then back to her. He grinned. “Too 
much light.” 

“Oh you — ” she murmured. She 
touched the controls, and the sun 
disappeared, being replaced by a 
huge, mellow moon that sailed ma- 
jestically on the simulated horizon. 
It was impossible to tell it from the 
real thing. 

“How’s that?” 

“A little dark.” 

Ignoring his comment, she came 
back and took his arm, and they 
went strolling across the flowers and 
grass. “Don’t you like my moon, 
Mark?” 

“Sure. It’s fine. Sort of aphro- 
disiac, of couree, but — ” 

“Isn’t that what it’s for?” Jen- 
nette asked innocently. 

“I dunno. I never had a moon.” 

“Let’s sit down here,” she said 
abruptly. 

T hey were eating pomegran- 
ates, biting briefly into them 
and sucking on the sour juices. The 
moon had risen higher during the 
past hour, becoming a little smaller 
in appearance. It was a peaceful, 
contemplative scene. Jennette snug-

gled up against Mark, thoughtfully 
tracing a design with fruit juice on- 
his arm. 

“This is fun,” she said softly. “So 
much more fun than the usual 
things a person has to do.” 
“Mmmm?” 

“Oh, you know. Checking re- 
ports from the factory, making sure 
there is plenty of ammunition all 
the time, ijestering the body manu- 
facturers so you’ll always have 
something decent to wear. Always 
watching or somebody will sneak in 
and blow up part of your shelter.” 
“Yeah. Well, guess that’s life.” 
Jennette sighed and picked up 
another fruit. “It gets so tiresome, 
always basing to keep on the look- 
out and fighting people. Don’t you 
get bored by it.” 

“Sure, sometimes. It’s gotta be 
done though. Otherwise you 
couldn’t tell what might happen.” 
“Mark — ” Jennette said hesitant- 
ly- 

“Yes?” 

“Mark, would you shoot me if 
you found me outside your shel- 
ter?” She looked coyly up at him. 

“Well, sure, unless you had a 
proper, government-authorized per- 
mit to be there.” Mark turned as- 
tonished eyes on her. “What else 
could I do?” 

“Oh, but you know I wouldn’t 
do anything to harm your place.” 
“Aw, Jennette,” Mark said un- 
comfortably, “of course you would. 
Anybody would. If people started 
acting like that, the whole balance 
would be upset.” 

She gently stroked his arm where 
the fruit juice had dried. Her face 
crinkled up and she giggled. “May- 
be you just don’t know me.” 

“Let’s talk about something else,” 

WORLD WITHOUT WAR 



Mark suggested. 

“What’s the matter? Do I shock 
you?” 

Mark laughed and brushed his 
lips against her shoulder. “I’m pret- 
ty hard to shock. Expecially by 
you.” 

“See?” she replied archly. 
“You’re just as anti-social as I 
<ini. 

Mark’s face clouded. “It’s noth- 
ing to brag about, though.” 

‘T’it> not bragging.” She sighed 
again, and resumed her fruit. Ey- 
ing it speculatively, she said, “I 
guess I’m just bored with life, that’s 
all. Sometimes things seem so silly. 
Like all the times you have to get 
a new body. You’d think the manu- 
facturers were giving them away 
free.” 

“Yeah. Not like it used to be. 
Guess business is pretty good.” 

“Something ought to be done 
about it.” 

Mark grinned mischievously. 
“What do you suggest? Build an- 
other factory?” 

“Oh, you know you can’t do that. 
Somebody is always blowing it up.” 

“Well, don’t worry. In another 
hundred years or so, people will 
start dying off again. These proto- 
bodies aren’t as serviceable as the 
manufactured kind.” 

“Yes, but if they keep producing 
new people in the Decanting Cen- 
ters, what good is that going to 
do?” 

“I dunno. Blow up the Decanting 
Centers, maybe.” 

“Maybe,” Jennette said, glancing 
impishly at the man beside her, “we 
ought to just stop wearing these 
silly old manufactured bodies en- 
tirely.” 

“Yes?” Mark tasted a pomegran- 

65 



ate, made a face, and tried another. 
“Just what do you suggest people 
wear?” 

“They could go around in their 
protobodics.” 

“What?” Mark looked swiftly 
and scarchingly at her, alarm on 
his face. 

“Why Mark,” she laughed dis- 
armingly. “You’re such a righteous 
beast, aren’t you?” 

“Great Atoms, jennette,” he 
said, gazing intently at her golden- 
decked eyes, wondering what 
strange things went on inside that 
lovely head. “You mean go around 
all the time as if w'e were savages? 
Why that’s illegal, immoral, and 
besides — besides, it’s dangerous. 
Suppose somebody took a shot at 
you? You’ve only got one proto- 
body, you know.” 

“A clever fighter like you 
shouldn’t have too much trouble 
writh that, if you’re careful,” she 
said gaily. “And I’m pretty good 
at that myself.” 

Mark took a slow deep breath 
as he decided that she was just 
teasing him. “I’m surprised at you, 
Jennette.” 

She shrugged. “I’m bored, I 
guess. I’d like to try something 
new, just for excitement. Personal- 
ly, sometimes I think the whole 
social system we have is pretty silly, 
anyway.” 

"Atoms,” Mark mumbled. 

“No need to swear about it,” she 
chided him. “Come on, Mark. Just 
think about it for a minute. And 
be consistant.” 

“Consistancy is all right for a 
free psi,” he said. “It sure doesn’t 
do a protobody any good.” 

Jennette laughed scornfully. “I’ll 
bet you believe all that stuff they 

66 



feed you in the Decanting Center 
about ancient history.” 

“ ’Course not,” Mark said de- 
fensively. 

“All right then. Why follow all 
these rules of social conduct if 
there’s no good basis for them?” 
“.Aw, but there is,” he replied 
seriously. “There was a big war — 
way back centuries before we were 
decanted out at Center.” 

“Hah,” said Jennette. 

“Sure. And it was a whole lot of 
people w'ho cooperated with each 
other in it. There must have been 
hundreds of them — it was an aw- 
fully big war. Hundreds of people, 
all on one side, all fighting together 
against the other side.” 

“I don’t believe it.” 

“It’s true, I tell you,” Mark in- 
sisted religiously. “Hundreds and 
hundreds of people. Maybe even 
as many as a thousand, all dressed 
alike — with clothes, I mean. And 
they didn’t shoot each other — they 
just killed the p>eople they were 
fighting — the hundreds of people 
on the other side.” 

“Other .side of what?” 

Mark frowned. “Oh, I guess that 
is just an expression. But that’s 
what happened, anyway. Before 
civilization got started, people co- 
operated like that.” 

“That’s just a whole lot of 
theory,” Jennette Insisted. “No- 
body’s going to make me ever be- 
lieve people used to act like that. 
Besides, there just aren’t enough 
people around to have all those 
mythical wars.” 

Patiently, Mark continued. “I’m 
telling you, Jennette, this is more 
than theory. There are still some 
records left from those days.” 
“Prove it.” 



E. G. VON WALD 



“All right. That’s not hard. 
Somebody had to build the fac- 
tories, didn’t they? And the De- 
canting Centers?” 

“Robots.” 

“Who built the first robot fac- 
tory?” 

Jennettc considered. Then she 
shrugged petulantly. “Ob all right. 
Maybe a few people did cooperate. 
But not hundreds of them. People 
just don’t act like that.” 

“Well, they did. And, of course, 
the obvious thing happened. Since 
thev cooperated in some things, 
they cooperated in a lot of thing.s, 
even fighting. That’.s liow they 
could make war, you know — not 
the nice, social sort of fighting we 
do now. And you can imagine w'hat 
happened. You can kill an awful 
lot of people awful fast, if a gang 
gets together on it like that. If they 
didn’t h.ive the artificial bodies and 
the psi transfer transniitters to make 
them come alise, tliere wouldn’t 
have been anybody left after a 
while. 'I'liat cooperation is rough 
stuir.” 

“Obviously,” she commented 
dryly. 

“Well, that’s the reason for every- 
thing, then. Pietty soon the fac- 
tories couldn’t turn out hypnobodies 
fast enough and ]5eo]de luid to fight 
in their protobodies sometimes. But 
after a few centuries, the leaders 
began to get civili/ed, and decided 
to put an end to all tliis cooperative 
killing. I guess they all got together 
and agreed not to coo[)eiate with 
each other in anything in the fu- 
ture.” 

“It stand.s to reason,” Mark con- 
cluded, “people had to learn to be 
civilized. They weren’t just born 
that w'ay. It’s- — it’s culture.” 

WORLD WITHOUT WAR 



“Pouf,” said Jennette critically. 
“All right,” he growled, biting 
viciously into a pomegranate. “Let’s 
hear your big story if it’s so good.” 

ENNETTE stretched out her 
legs and contemplated her wig- 
gling toes. “Oh, 1 don't know. I 
don't have any real ideas. But I 
know Ix'tter than to believe that 
sort of nonsense. People just ari'n’t 
like that, and you know it.” She 
hesitated thoughtfully, tht.'n con- 
tinued. “Maybe a feu of them got 
together now and then for a party 
or something like this. But not 
hundreds of them.” 

When Mark did not reply, she 
laughed and said, “1 guess I’m just 
feeling riscpie tonight.” 

“You sure aie," he mumbled. 
“Of course there aie parts of the 
old mythology that seem rather in- 
teresting — beautil ul , even — ” 

“It’s not mythology'.” 

“Liki' the part that deals with 
marriage.” 

She waited. Mark dutifully 
echoed, “Deals with what?” 
“Marriage.” 

Mark considered it. Then he 
shook his head. “NN'hat's that?” 
“See? she taunted him. “You 
don’t know everything like you 
think you do. Marriage,” she ex- 
plained, “was a sort of cooperative 
agreement that the ancient people 
were supposed to have entered 
into.” 

“Sure, just like I said,” Mark 
stated with assurance. “Hundreds 
of people did it. Tlu.-y got involved 
in this marriage agieement, and 
made war on each other with it.” 
“What a dope. Marriage was an 
agreement between just two peo- 

67 



pie. And that much I might believe. 
Hundreds is too much.” 

“It was hundreds,” Mark in- 
sisted. 

“It was not. It was just two. And 
what’s more, it wjis between a man 
and a woman. They lived together 
with their protobodies and agreed 
to cooperate together, and they 
made children and took care of 
them until they grew up.” 

“Why that’s thirt)’ or forty 
years,” Mark exclaimed. “Even tlie 
wars didn’t last that long. That’s 
really nonsense. Besides, you can 
only make children in the Decant- 
ing Centers. And it’s all done by 
machines.” 

“Well, maybe it is a little far 
fetched. But I think it’s cute.” 

“Humph.” 

There was a few minutes si- 
lence. Then Tennette said softly, 
“Mark—” 

“Yes?” 

“Mark, you like me a lot, don’t 
you?” 

Mark squirmed uncomfortably, 
and stared at the artificial moon. 

“Don’t you?” she insisted. “More 
than you ever have anybody else?” 

“Well, guess that’s right,” he 
admitted lamely. “A whole lot more 
than I should.” 

She reassuringly patted his hand 
with her little one. “That’s all right, 
Mark. I won’t tell anybody. Besides, 
I feel just the same way about you.” 

Mark nodded without .speaking, 
worriedly studying the vague mark- 
ings on the bright luminous disk 
in the simulated sky. 

“Mark, don’t you ever want to 
see the real me?” she inquired 
urgently. “Don’t you sometimes 
feel kind of empty because you 
can never really have me — know 

68 



me, because all you ever see is a 
manufactuied thing that only 
somewhat resembles what I am 
really like?” 

Mark blushed. She had come a 
little too close to the uncomfortable 
truth. But he rcfu.sed to admit it, 
at least to her. He mumbled an in- 
distinct denial. 

“Are you sure?” she said, grab- 
bing his hands, gazing intently into 
his eyes, forcing him to look at her. 
“Wouldn’t you sometime like to 
come down to my transmitter 
quarters?” 

“But—” 

“And see and touch my proto- 
body — the thing I really am?” 

“Aw—” 

“Scared?” 

“Maybe I am.” 

“That's silly.” 

Mark swallowed and said stiffly, 
“Just becau.se there is a no-fight 
clause in your invitation tonight 
doesn’t necessarily mean I have to 
follow it, you know. You don’t 
need weapons. I could strangle 
your protobody easily.” 

“You wouldn’t,” she said con- 
fidently. 

“You sure don’t think much of 
me, do you?” 

“I think just the same of you 
as you do of me,” she said simply. 

With impulsive hunger, Mark 
threw his arms around her, holding 
her tightly against him, nuzzling 
her, smelling the perfume of her 
hair, incoherently mumbling into 
her ear. “Jennette, Jennette,” he 
sang, “I think more of you than 
anything. I love you. I know it’s 
wrong, but I would never even 
shoot you, because sometimes it 
hurts you, and I wouldn’t want 
you to feel even the slightest dis- 

E. G. VON WALD 




comfort.” He stopped, took a deep 
breath, and added meekly, “I’m 
sorry.” 

“But Mark,” she wliispered. 
“Why is it really so wrong?” 

“You know.” 

“Suppose I told you that this 
body i.s my protobody right now?” 
she asked earnestly. 

“But it isn’t.” 

“It is,” she said faintly. 

Mark’s breath hi.ssed as he 
gasped, jennette was blushing all 
over her body, heightening the 
golden color of it. He let her go, 
and she slid off his lap onto the 
shadowed grass beside him. She 
bit her lip. “1 didn’t really mean 
to tell you — yet.” 

Tliere was silence. Mark said 
quietly, “That’s all right, Jennette.” 
"You aren't angry with me, are 
you?” 

“No,” he said slowly. “Not 
angry.” 

“Mark—” 

“Yes?” 

“Now that we’re Into this thing,” 
she asked hopefully, “why don't 
we try this marriage agreement — 
you know, like the ancients did. 
It seems like such a beautiful thing 
to do when two people like us — 
you know.” 

“I don’t know.” Mark sliook his 
head doubtfully. “I just don’t know 
about it.” 

“Why not? You wouldn’t have 
to n'ally stay here. It could be just 
a secret agreement between us. 
And you could come and see me 
whenever you liked.” 

“It all seems so unreal,” lie mut- 
tered. 

They lapsed into tliougiit, both 
avoiding looking at the other. 
There was no sound except a faint 

WORLD WITHOUT WAR 



sighing of wind in the leaves of 
the well trimmed shrubbery. 

“Suppose,” Mark said finally, 
“suppose other people started do- 
ing this thing? This coojjerative 
agreement? Lots of people must 
want to, just like we do.” 

“I suppose so,” she admitted. 

“I went through this once be- 
fore,” he wt'nt on absently. “.Mioiit 
ninety years ago 1 met this wom- 
an — slie was awfully nice. Clever. 
Understood things. Not like you, 
of course, but still she was vi'r\ 
nice. I thought about it tlu'ii.” 

“What happened to her?” Jen- 
nette asked numbly. 

“She died after a w'hile. .She 
was pretty old. Oh, we didn’t do 
anything,” he hastened to add. 
“We kept it all on a jjcrfcctly 
moral and honest plane* — never s:nv 
each other e.xcept at authorized 
government sex parties, like this, 
and all. Fought whenever we r.ui 
across e.ieh other outside. But I 
remember thinking at the time that 
some sort of agreement would he 
nice. We got along awlully well. 
I could never understand vvliat she 
saw in me.’’ 

“I can,” Jennette whispered. 

“I'his i.s just the same, only a 
lot mure .so,” Mark went on 
thoughtfully. “And it’s wrong. You 
know it's wrong. Suppose a lot of 
people started it. Fir.st thing you 
know, whole groups of people 
would be cooperating with each 
other again. And when thev got 
intc) trouble outside, or planned 
an innocent little raid on some- 
body’s shelter, they would all work 
together on it. .And pretty soon, 
tlicrc would be other groups co- 
operating in fighting back again. 
Tliey’d have to. 

69 



“And that, of course, would be 
the end of civilization, ftetty soon, 
there would be nothing left, and 
everybody would be dead.” 

Jennette did not reply when he 
stopped. She turned her head away, 
but Mark could hear her uneven 
breathing. 

“We have a re.sponsibility to- 
ward society at large. We know it. 
We’ve been well educated and we 
aren’t savages. Neither one of us 
can get away from it. It might be 
wonderful at first, but our con- 
science would come out sooner or 
later, and the whole thing would 
be ruined.’’ 

She rubbed her face with her 
cupped hands, shaking her head. 
“I suppose — ’’ she murmured un- 
happily. 

“You’d hate yourself for it after 



a while,” he said. 

For a few minutes, Jennette 
stared at the grass before her feet, 
pulling up little blades of it one 
by one. Then Mark stood up, and 
she flashed him a small, wistful, 
damp .smile. Together they walked 
back toward the elevator, stepping 
quietly and almost furtively on the 
soft ground. “If it weren’t for 
that — ” he started. 

“I understand,” she replied 
quickly. Taking hold of his arm, 
she said, “I’m sony.” 

“Sure.” Mark grinned affection- 
ately at her. “Come on. Let’s see 
if they’ve been having any good 
fights upstairs.” They stepped in- 
to the elevator and disappeared. 
The artificial moon continued its 
regular motion through the simu- 
lated sky. 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 

A small machine that j^uarantees year round air and temperature conditioning at 
a cost competitive with coal, gas and oil may soon be standard equipment in all 
homes. This wcatherstat which works on the same heat-pump idea as your home 
freezer or refrigerator to give you freedom from furnace worries and dust, main- 
tains constant humidity despite conditions out of doors. 

Gauze bandages on wounds will soon be a thing of the past. New transparent 
surgical dressings can be sprayed directly on the wound from an aerosol “bomb.” 
The clear plastic bandage will enable surgeons to inspect a wound without remov- 
ing it and will peel off easily. 

An electronic “brain” that scores students’ tests at the rate of 1,400 a minute 
and saves teachers a lot of time has been invented. Installation takes about one 
year and equipment will soon be available throughout the nation. 

Headlights, ten times more powerful than those of today, will be used on auto- 
mobiles in the year 2003 and will eliminate blinding glare to approaching drivers. 
More light with less glare will be possible by the use of polarized lenses and wind- 
shields. In daytime driving the polarization can be cut out with a flick of the 
switch. 

Exhaust fumes from buses and cars may soon be given their “walking papers”. 
Engineers have found that liquifled petroleum gas, such as propane, burns to an 
odorless, smokeless exhaust, yields quieter bus operation and cuts costs too.

P ANIC roused him — the black 
imp of panic tliat lived under 
the garish rug of this unfamiliar 
room and crawled out at dawn to 
nudge him awake and stare from 
the blank space to his left where 
Tillic’s gray head should have 
been. 

His fists clenched in anger — at 
himself. He'd never been the sort 
to make allowance for his own 
weakness and didn’t propose to be- 
gin doing so now, at age cightv'- 
six. Tillic’d been killed in that 
crash well over a year ago and it 
was time he got used to his widow- 
erhood and quit searching for 
her every morning. 

But even after he gave himself 
the bawling out, orientation came 
slowly. The surroundings looked 
so strange. No matter what he told 
himself it was hard to believe that 
he was indeed Fred Lubway, me- 
chanical engineer, and had a right 
to be in this single bed, alone in 
this house his Tillie had never 
seen. 

The right to be there was all 
wrong. He disliked the house and 
hated all its furni.shings. 

The cybernetic cooker in the 
kitchen; the magnetically-sus- 
pended divans in the living room ; 
the three-dimensional color broad- 
casts he could so readily project 
to any wall or ceiling; the solar- 
tropic machinery that would turn 
any face of the pentagonal house 
into the sun or the shade or the 
breeze: the lift that would raise 
the entire building a hundred feet 
into the air to give him a wider 
\-iew and more privacy — all left 
him dissatisfied. 

They were new. None had been 
shared with Tillie. He used them 



only to the extent required by law 
to fulfill his duty as a consumer. 

“You must change your home 
because of the change in your fam- 
ily composition,” the Ration 
Board’s bright young female had 
explained, right after Tillie's fu- 
neral. “Your present furnishings 
are obsolete. S’ou must rc[)lace 
them.” 

“And if I don’t?’’ He’d been 
truculent. 

“I doubt we’d have to invoke 
the penalties for criminal under- 
consumption,” she’d explaini’d 
airily. “There are plenty of other 
possible courses of action. Maybe 
w'e’d just get a decision that you’re 
prematurely senile and unable to 
care for yourself. Then you’d go 
to a home for the aged where 
they’d help you consume — with 
forced feedings and such.” 

So here he was, in this home- 
of-bis-own riiat seemed to belong 
to someone else. Well, at least he 
wasn’t senile, even if he did move 
a little slowly, now, getting out of 
bed. He’d warm up soon. All by 
himself. With no one's help. 

And as far as these newfangled 
gadgets in the bathroom were con- 
cerned, he could follow any well- 
written set of directions. He’d 
scalded himself that time only be- 
cause the printed instructions 
were so confusing. 

He took a cold shower this time. 

When the airtowel had finished 
blowing and he was half dry — 
not wholly dry because the ma- 
chine wasn’t adapted to people 
who took ice-cold showers — he 
went in to the clothing maihinc. 
He punched the same few holes 
in its tape that he put there every 
day, stood in the right place, and 

73 



in due course emerged with his 
long, rawboned frame covered by 
magenta tights having an exces- 
sively baggy seat. 

He knew the costume was 
neither pretty nor fashionable and 
that its design, having been wholly 
within his control when he punched 
the tape, revealed both his taste 
and his mood. He didn’t care; 
there was no one in the world 
whom he wanted to impress. 

He looked in the dressing room 
mirror not to inspect the tights but 
to examine his face and see if it 
needed shaving. Too late he re- 
membered that twenty years had 
elapsed since the permanent de- 
pilatories were first invented and 
ten since he’d used one and 
stopped having to shave. 

There were too many changes 
like that in this gadget-mad 
world ; too many new ways of do- 
ing old things. Life had no sta- 
bility. 

He stalked into the kitchen 
wishing he could skip breakfast — 
anger always unsettled his stom- 
ach. But everyone was required to 
eat at least three meals a day. The 
vast machine-records system that 
kept track of each person’s con- 
sumption would reveal to the Ra- 
tion Board any failure to use his 
share of food, so he dialed Break- 
fast Number Three — tomato juice, 
toast, and coffee. 

The signal-panel flashed “Un- 
der-Eating” and he knew the state 
machine-records system had ad- 
vised his cybernetic cooker to in- 
crease the amount of his consump- 
tion. Chin in hands he sat hope- 
lessly at the kitchen table await- 
ing his meal, and in due course 
was served prunes, waffles, bacon, 

74 



eggs, toast, and tea — none of 
which he liked, c.xcept for toast. 

He ate dutifully nevertheless, 
telling himself he wasn’t afraid of 
the ration-cops who were always 
suspecting him of underconsump- 
tion because he was the tall skinny 
type and never got fat like most 
people, but that he ate what the 
cooker had given him because his 
father had been unemployed for a 
long time during the depression 
seventy-five years before, so he’d 
never been able to bring himself to 
throw food away. 

Failure to consume had in the 
old days been called “overproduc- 
tion” and by any name it was bad. 
So was war — he’d read enough 
about w'ar to be glad that form of 
consumption had finally been 
abolished. 

Still it was a duty and not a 
pleasure to eat so much, and a re- 
lief to get up and put the dirty 
dishes into the dispo.sal machine 
and go up topside to his gyro. 

D isgustingly, he had a long 

wait before departure. After 
climbing into the g)'ro and trans- 
mitting his flight plan he had to 
sit seething for all of fifteen min- 
utes before the Mount Diablo 
Flight Control Center deigned to 
lift his remote-controlled gyro into 
the air. And w’hen the signal 
came, ascent w>as so awkwardly 
abrupt it made his ears pop. 

He couldn’t even complain. The 
Center was mechanical, and un- 
equipped to hear complaints. 

It routed him straight down the 
San Joaquin Valley — a beautiful 
sight from fifteen thousand feet, 
but over-familiar. He fell asleep 

DAVE DRYFOOS 



and awakened only when unex- 
pectedly brought down at Bakers- 
field Field. 

Above his instrument panel the 
printing-receiver said “Routine 
Check of Equipment and Docu- 
ments. Not Over Five Minutes’ 
Delay.” 

But it could take longer. And 
tardiness was subject to official 
punishments as a form of unpro- 
ductiveness. He called George 
Harding at the plant. 

Harding apparently had been 
expecting the call. His round blulf 
face wore a scowl of annoyance. 

“Don’t you ever watch the news- 
casts?” he demanded angrily. 
“They began this ‘Routine Check’ 
you’re in at five this morning, and 
were broadcasting pictures of the 
resulting traffic jam by six. If you’d 
filed a flight plan for Santa Bar- 
bara and come on down the coast 
you’d have avoided all this.” 

“I'm not required to listen to 
newsca.sts,” Fred replied tartly. “I 
own the requisite number of re- 
ceivers and — ” 

“Now, listen, Fred,” Harding in- 
terrupted. “We need you down 
here so hurry up!” 

Fred heard him switch of! and 
sat for a moment trembling with 
rage. But he ended by grinning 
wryly. Everyone was in the same 
boat, of course. For the most part, 
people avoided thinking about it. 
But he could now see himself as if 
from above, spending his life Hit- 
ting back and forth between home 
and plant, plant and home; wrack- 
ing his brain to devise labor-saving 
machines while at the plant, then 
rushing home to struggle with the 
need to consume their tremendous 
output. 

WASTE NOT, WANT 



Was he a man? Or was he a 
caged squirrel racing in an exer- 
cisc-whcel, running himself ragged 
and with great effort producing 
absolutely nothing? 

He wasn't going to do it any 
longer, by golly! He was going 
to — 

“Good morning!” A chubby 
young man in die |H-a-green uni- 
form of a ration-cop ojrened the 
door and climbed uninvited into 
the cockpit. “May I ( beck the up- 
to-dateness of your ship’s eipiip- 
ment, please?” 

Fred didn’t answer. He didn’t 
have to. The young officer was al- 
ready in the manual pilot’s .seat, 
checking the secondary controls. 

In swift routine he tried motor 
and instruments, and took the craft 
briefly aloft. Down again, he de- 
manded Fred’s papers. 

The licenses that pertained to 
the gyro were in order, but there 
was trouble over Fred’s personal 
documents: his ration-book con- 
tained far too few sales-validations. 

“You’re not doing your share of 
consuming, Oldtimer,” the young 
cop said mildly. “Look at all these 
unused food allotments! Want to 
cause a depression?” 

“No.” 

“Man, if you don’t eat more 
than this, we’ll have mass starva- 
tion!” 

“I know the slogans.” 

“Yes, but do you know the pen- 
alties? Forced feeding, compulsory 
consumption — do you think they’re 
fun?” 

“No.” 

“Well, you can file your flight 
plan and go, but if you don’t spend 
those tickets before their e.xpira- 
tion dates. Mister, you'll have 

75 




cause to regret it.” 

With a special pencil, he sense- 
marked the card’s margins. 

Fred felt that each stroke of the 
pencil was a black mark against 
him. He watched in apprehensive 
silence. 

The young cop was also silent. 
When finished he wordlessly re- 
turned the identification, tipped 
his cap, and swaggered off, his 
thick neck red above his green 
collar. 

Fred found he’d had more than 
enough of swaggering young men 
with beefy red necks. That added 
to his disgust with the constant 
struggle to produce and consume, 
consume and produce. Vague, 
wishful threats froze as determina- 
tion: he absolutely wasn’t going 
through any more of it. 

He filed a flight plan tliat would 
return him to his home, and in 
due course arrived there. 

The phone rang in his ears as 
he of)cned the cockpit. He didn’t 
want to answer, and he stayed on 
the roof securing the gyro and 
plugging in its battery-charger. But 
he couldn’t ignore the bell’s in- 
sistent clamor. 

When he went downstairs and 
switched on the phone, George 
Harding’s round face splashed on 
the wall. 

“Fred,” he said, “when we 
talked a few hours ago, you forgot 
to say you were sick. I phoned to 
confirm that for the Attendance 
Report. Did this call get you out 
of bed?” 

He could see it hadn’t. There- 
fore Fred knew he must be re- 
cording the audio only, and not 
the video; trying to give him a 
break with the Attendance people 

76 



and coach him on the most ap- 
peasing amwers. 

A well-meant gesture, but a 
false one. And Fred was fed up 
with the false. “I forgot nothing,” 
he said bluntly. “I’m perfectly 
well and haven’t been near Ix-d.” 

“No'v, wait,” George said hast- 
ily. “It’s no crime to be sick. And 
— ah — don’t say anything you 
wouldn’t want preserved for po.s- 
terity.” 

“George, I’m not going to play 
along with you.” Fred insisted. 
“This busine.5s of producing to 
consume and consuiTiing to pro- 
duce has got me down. It’s beyond 
all reason!” 

“No, it isn’t. You’re an excellent 
mechanical engineer, Fred, but 
you’re not an economist. That’s 
why you don’t understand. Just ex- 
cuse me for a minute, and I’ll 
show you.” 

He left the field of view. Fred 
waited incuriously for him to re- 
turn, suddenly conscious of the 
fact that he now had nothing bet- 
ter to do with his time. 

George was back in less than a 
minute, anyhow. “O.K.” he said 
briskly. “Now, where were we? 
Oh, yes. I just wanted to say that 
production is a form of consump- 
tion, too — even the production of 
machine-tools and labor-saving de- 
vices. So there’s nothing incon- 
sistent — ” 

“What are you trying to do?” 
Fred demanded. Don’t lecture me 
— I know as much econ as you 
do!” 

“But you’ve got to come back to 
work, Fred! I want you to use your 
rations, put your shoulder to the 
wheel, and confonn generally. The 
policing’s too strict for you to try

loo wi'll to want to sue you — ’’ 

“1 don’t need you to protucl me, 
George,” Fred said stiffly. “I guess 
yc'u mean well enough. But good- 
hye." He switched off.

The 

Work-out 

Planet 

Colonial life on Mars with a 
“chicken” like Shirley was 
enough to make any Earth- 
man shudder. But what can 
you do when you are mentally 
incompetent and legally 
trapped? 

BY R. E. BANKS 



I T WAS Saturday afternoon and 
I was in our study-lab working 
on my home cyclotron. The cyclo- 
tron was so new that Nora hadn’t 
paid for it yet, but at least the solu- 
tion to my troubles was at hand. 
Now I could finish my einsteins. 

That year 1 had been unable to 
find work for more than six weeks 
— all because I hadn’t finished my 
einsteins. Most people these days 
finish them by the age of twenty- 
one or two, but I was thirty-two 
and beginning to worry. So was 
Nora. It was more than a little em- 
barra.ssing that the greatest female 
scientific theorist in New York City 
had a husband with a low IQ. So 
after having held my last job for 
only two days — a job which was 
hardly more than an office boy's — I 
had gone out and bought the home 
cyclotron. I thoroughly intended to 
put an end to this nonsense about 
my being an intellectual light- 
weight. I had taken a vow not to 
leave home until I had finished my 
einsteins and though Nora lifted 
her brows at the cost of the 
machine, she had said nothing. Per- 
haps because she was too wrapped 
up in her work on the “Mathe- 
matical Point-Count of the Surfaces 
of Great Paintings.” 

“Doesn’t anyone answer door- 
bells on earth, Mr. Singer?” 

I turned in surprise to sec a 
young woman standing in the door. 
Then iny heart sank. It was Nora’s 
cousin from Mars, Shirley Reming- 
ton. She looked very odd indeed. 
She wore a light wool dress that 
outlined her body instead of a lei- 
sure-work smock or the standard 
female coveralls. Her hair was too 
long and waved, a mass of bronze, 
making her head look heavy to me 



78 




brcau<!C the female hutch haircut 
ha>iirt changed in fifty years. She 
wore archaic lipstick on her mouth 
and her eyebrows were neat and 
plucked which stamped her as a 
Colonial. 

I had seen pictures of her when 
Nora’s uncle Remington had vi'- 
ited F.arth alx>ut three years before. 
At that time he had the crazy idi-a 
that she should come to Earth to 
find a husband, since men were so 
short in the colonies, but we’d 
talk<‘d hitn out of it then. 

“Hello,” I said, trying to bide my 
shock at her ugliness. “What brings 
you all the way from Mars?” 

“Didn't Nora tell you 1 was com- 
ing?” she asked in surprise. 

“No.” I said. Her face showed 
no signs of work at all; no lines on 
her skin, no red veins in the eves. 
A smooth, shiny complexion like 
the ugly, unmarked jx'tal of a gar- 
den lose. She even bad a tan from 
being outdoors and not working 
very hard. 

“Quite frankly.” she said, “I've 
come to New York to find a suitable 
and pleasing mate. We’ve had the 
usual cosmic ray storms on Mars 
and the male situation is fantastic. 
So when Nora said for me to come 
on ahc.id and m i' what I could do 
in New York, I came flying — or 
rather rocketing.'' 

That struck me as queer. Of 
course Nora would be mildly in- 
terested in the marital success of 
her cousin, but Nora has very little 
time for such fixilishiu'ss and trying 
to introduce this ugly girl (nvioii 
hose!) around in New S’ork would 
be a 'hecr waste of effort. 

“Excuse me for sounding doubt- 
ful, Mi>s Remington.'' I said, “but 
you don’t have a line on your face. 




79 



Your figure is too youthful. It’s too 
curvy to be frank with you. No 
man on Earth would look at you 
twice.” 

“I realir.e my shortcomings,” she 
said with an undisturbed grin. “But 
Cousin Nora is a very smart person 
and she told me to come. I’m leav- 
ing the answers to her.” 

Disgusted that I had to inteiTupt 
my work, I led the girl to the spare 
room. There was the smell of How- 
ers about her, some artificial con- 
coction she called “perfume” and 
a long way from the socially ac- 
ceptable aroma of perspiration that 
every attractive young Earth girl 
favors. I accidentally touched her 
while picking up her luggage and 
shuddered at her softness. 



N ora was in her lab behind the 
garage. Dr. Ryder was there 
also. I knew they were very busy, 
working on Nora’s demonstration 
to l>e given tliat evening before the 
Society of Electrostatic Engineers. 
But I couldn’t help puzzling over 
Nora’s intentions. Certainly she 
knew that my work on the einsteins 
liad to be gotten through with at 
all possible speed and she couldn’t 
expect me to jockey her unattrac- 
tive cousin around the city on a 
fruitless hunt for a man. 

Dr. Ryder was in the harness that 
Nora had designed. It was a very 
clever contraption, destined to open 
a whole new field of leisure-work. 
Nora had an original Rembrandt 
on the scanning surface and her 
computer was scanning the work of 
the old master carefully, reading 
each and every brush stroke he had 
made. She had a photospectrometer 
set up alongside — one of those de- 

80 



vices which can distinguish over 
two million shades of color. The 
paint was mixed to the proper 
shade by automatic devices. The 
artist — in this case Dr. Ryder — 
was .standing Ix'fore a canvas witli 
his arms locked in a sort of harness. 
As the scanner read out each brush 
stroke Rembrandt had made on 
that original painting centuries ago, 
the harness duplicated the stroke in 
terms of motion on Ryder’s arms, 
controlled by an analog servo- 
mechanism loop. Ryder was paint- 
ing a Rembrandt which, when fin- 
ished, would be indistinguishable 
from the original except for age 
effects. 

No value in duplicating Rem- 
brandt, of course. The value was in 
training the artist’s muscles. After 
Ryder had painted Rembrandt and 
Van Gogh and a half-dozen other 
great artists for hour after hour, he 
would have some concept of how 
the masters worked. In si.x months 
he would know more about painting 
teclmiques than a man could learn 
in ten years under the old system. 
This exciting technique, designed 
for leisure work, was just another 
brilliant idea of Nora’.s — Nora 
Remington Singer’s Art-Aid, she 
called it. 

“I thought I told you we were 
busy,” said Nora. 

Nora turned off the Thompson 
Probe and Ryder slipped out of 
the harness with a sigh, exercising 
his tired anns. 

“Your cousin from Mars is here,” 
I said. “I deem that important 
enough to interrupt you. Especially 
when she tells me you encouraged 
her to come to Earth on a fool’s er- 
rand.” 

Nora looked at Bob Ryder and 

R. E. BANKS 




he looked at her. I didn’t like that 
look. “I think she’s very wise to 
come to earth to find a man,” said 
Nora. 

“Her looks are all against her.” 

Nora is consciou.s of licr own 
great beauty. She’s lived a full life. 
I’liough only three years older than 
1, she looks fifty. The hard lines 
of her face, the deep pouches undi’r 
her eyes, and the bent posture of 
her body give her a great animal 
attraction. I have seen men stop in 
sheer astonishment at her admir- 
able work-worn figure. 

“Standards of beauty are dif- 
ferent on Mars,” said Nora. 

“If she’s brought money, she has 
a chance,” said Bob. 

“And I suppose I’m the one to 
take her around am! intiotluee 
her — ” 

Nora laughed. “Now. Hal. don't 
get excited. You arc out of a job—” 

“I’m working hard on my ein- 
stelns — ” 

“And you conijrletcly ruined my 
digital read-outs on the ‘Mathe- 
matical Point-Count System’ last 
week, and so I’d think you could 
make yourself useful to someune in 
my family.” 

“For years,” I said angrily, 
“you've complained because you've 
practically supported me. Now with 
the new home cyclotron I can get 
my eiiisteins done and maybe find 
a decent job. That’s all I'm tiying 
to do and cacli day’i delay means 
another day that I’m a stone around 
your neck.” 

“Oh, now, Hal, you mustn’t feel 
that way.” 

“Having a low IQ is no crime,” 
smiled Bob Ryder. “\\'h\, if I had 
a 120 I’d be proud. At least it sets 
you apart in a city where the dull 

THE WORK-OUT PLANET 



normal is 160.” 

“The Thompson Probe gives me 
headaches and so I work slower. 
Mr. Scientist,” 1 said. “Someday I 
may surprise yon all.” 

“Someday,’’ said Nora with a 
sigh, “yon may even be smart 
enough to figure out how to distin- 
gui.sh molecules of dust from ]jaiiit 
molecules on iny Mathematical 
Point-Count System of Art. That's 
more than I can do. But meanwhile 
Shirley is here and she's brought 
quite a large sum of money with hei 
which has to he taken care of and 
you can make yourself useful by 
taking her to Mr. DuPres.” 

I felt a wave of relief. Smart 
Nora! Mr. DuPres was our lawyer 
and the logical man to handle 
Shirley’s jn'ohlem. .\s a member (jf 
one of the profe>sions he was in the 
bottom quarter of society, for on 
F.arth the tcclinical skills predomi- 
nate. Therefore he would be ukid 
to handle .Shirley ftsr a fee. .And be- 
ing acquainted with lawyers, teach- 
ers, divines, doctors and other rilT- 
raff, he could [jrolrtibly find some- 
body for Sbirley, someone of low 
taste who would accept the Mar- 
tian idea of beauty. 

“That’s diH'crent.” 1 said. 

“Well, be off with her!" cried 
Nora with entlursiastn. “And Lifter 
the lawyer’s show her some of New 
York, if you wain. I’ll not be lionn- 
for supper anyway, since Bob and 
I have to leave early for the 
demonstration.” 

My relief ihatiged to anxiety. 
Nora was too cheerful about the 
whole thing. 

“DuPres may rn.it be at his office. 
It's Saturday al lernni m.” 

“DuPres will be at his office,” 
said Bob. “I don't know of a lowly 

81 



professional in New York who can 
make a living on a five day work- 
week.” 

“I’ll call just to make sure,” said 
Nora. “I wanted to talk to him 
anyway.” 

I left them. I paused to make the 
complicated signal that brought the 
car out of the garage automatically, 
and I thought I heard a burst of 
laughter from the lab. My uneasi- 
ness grew. I’m not a jealous man, 
but Nora and Bob make a fine 
couple, he with his white hair and 
lined face and Nora with her work- 
seared body. 

And when they get together they 
seem to talk down to me like a 
couple of parents to a simple- 
minded child. It would be well for 
me to get my einsteins done as 
soon as possible. 

A S WE drove downtown I had 
to explain to Shirley about our 
work-week. No one considers their 
job as important as their leisure- 
work any more. In fact, employers 
have been trying to push through 
the 454 day work- week. I had to 
explain that to Shirley, because on 
Mars the employers want to get 
the most out of their workers and 
the workers want to give as little 
as possible. 

“It’s simple,” I said. “On Earth, 
leisure-work and hobbies increa.se 
the efficiency of the person. Take 
a man on a straight office job. In 
the office he may be merely 
shuffling papers around. But in his 
leisure-work he may bo doing gar- 
den chemistry or a study of the 
molecular structure of plastics. His 
leisure-work is so difficult that or- 
dinary oflfice work becomes very 

82 



easy for him and he can do twice 
as much in half the time — because 
his leisure-work teaches him to 
think. Today work is the chief 
pleasure of mankind. At his office. 
Around the home. And in the all- 
important leisure-work that used to 
be called hobbies.” 

“All because of the Thompson 
Probe?” 

“All because of the Thompson 
Probe. It has made the final revolu- 
tion in mankind — the greatest since 
the Industrial Revolution. For cen- 
turies mankind complained that the 
layman could never catch up with 
science. Today all is changed. By 
the time he’s reached his majority 
the average man (or woman) has 
become the equivalent of a gradu- 
ate physics major in the old days. 
Science has a pretty hard time keep- 
ing up with us today,” I said proud- 

ly- 

We went past a large building 
that hummed with activity. 

“What’s that?” she asked point- 
ing. 

I laughed. “The public library.” 
“The library! It looks like a mob 
scene. Why, back home on Mars 
you’d see a crowd like that in front 
of the theatre but there’s never a 
crowd at the library.” 

“They keep the libraries open all 
night long,” I said. “They have had 
to cut book loan time to one week 
so that everybody will have a 
chance at them. Study is an imptor- 
tant part of leisure-work, especial- 
ly the classics and heavy scientific 
literature. A book can’t be a best- 
seller any more unless it’s pretty 
meaty on science.” 

A traffic policeman had his head 
bent over an experiment he was 
doing with a vacuum jar, and so I 

R. E. BANKS 



scooted across on a changing light 
and ended up in a mob that over- 
flowed the sidewalk. 

“What’s tliat crowd for?” 

I shot a sidelong glance at the 
girl and felt a tingle of pleasure. 
Living with a scientist of Nora’s 
mentality, 1 am usually the one to 
ask Cjuestinns. Despite the girl’s 
naivete, she really wanted to know, 
and I didn't give her the look of 
impatience that Nora and her 
friends are always giving me when 
I ask questions. 

“This is a w’ork-out,” I said, stop- 
ping our vehicle. “Leisure-work has 
its bad features. But we can expect 
this, the old principle of loss and 
gain, you know. For every advan- 
tage there is a disadvantage. To the 
truly ohjectise mind, there is no 
purpose in hiding the bad features 
of our lives.” 

The man was doing his last work- 
out. For thirty or more years he had 
been using a Thoinjjson Probe. He 
had worked hard for each 16 hours 
out of 24 under the Probe, every 
day of his life. The energy released 
by that machine had finally set its 
pattern on his ntTve cells. The day 
finally came when he turned olT his 
Probe — but couldn’t stop working. 
He had to keep going, burning him- 
.self out. 

He had been digging a patch of 
ground with a pick. The pick 
pounded the dirt with sludding 
blows and at each stroke the man 
gave a half-ciy of anguish because 
the rest of his body was tired - ab- 
normally tired after the years of 
ceaseless actis ity. The crowd about 
him was patient, grim-faced and 
respectful. Since no one has tune 
any more for funerals, it is social 
custom to attend any work-out you

see and pay homage to the dying 
with applause. 

The man raised his pick, gave a 
shriek and dropped to his knees as 
his heart e.xploded inside of him. 
He made some futile, erratic ges- 
tures, patting the ground and 
crawling loi a moment in a spas- 
modic fashion, then he shoved his 
face into the dirt, quivered, and lay 
still. 

The crowd applauded sombrely 
for his soul and then lieuan to melt 
as a woman came out of the house 
with a home emlialming kit and 
began to arrange his limbs. 

S HIRLEY shuddered, reminding 
me again of her repugnantly 
soft body. 

“Do people just die like that?” 
“He led a hajrpy, full life,” I 
said. “He was probably fifty-two, 
three. No one lives any longer any 
more. Last year a man of fifty-eight 
w'as discovered and he caused a sen- 
sation. But in terms of work we ac- 
complish four, five times as much 
as our ancestors who lived to be 
sLxty-.seventy. And we’re not as 
neurotic.” 

She sighed. “Doesn’t anybody 
have fun on Earth?” 

“What kind of fun?” 

“Oh, you know. Parties, and the 
beach and going to bars. Eating 
fine dinners and going to concerts 
and shows.” 

I was in a hurry to get rid of her, 
but 1 couldn’t pass that remark up. 
Chuckling, I swung a couple of 
blocks out of the way to show her 
the largest movie theatie in New 
Yoik. It’s hidden beivseen the 22- 
story All-Centuries Art Museum 
and one of the hundreds of build- 

83 



ings of the enlarged New York 
University. It has one hundred 
seats. 

“Martin and Lewis,” she said in 
surprise. 

I smiled proudly. “We don’t 
make fictional movies any more,” I 
said. “Not since the Thompson 
Probe. This film is over two hun- 
dred years old and the only people 
who come to see it are the very 
young children and ofT-planet visi- 
tors.” 

“But I saw a TV set in your liv- 
ing room.” 

“Sure. Most of the programs are 
put on by the universities and the 
scientific institutes. Last year the 
convention of the Institute of Ap- 
plied Science had an all-time record 
audience of 200 million. But there 
were some really fine papers — ” 

“On Mars people watch base- 
ball,” die said frowning. “Don’t 
you even have that?” 

“Baseball? Sounds familiar,” I 
said. “Wasn’t that the game they 
played on ice with skates and 
sticks?” 

She made a sound of protest in 
her throat. Suddenly she put her 
hand on my arm. “Stop! There’s a 
bar. My God, I could stand a 
drink — ” 

I Slopped reluctantly. I hadn’t 
been in a bar since I met Nora. 
Drinking fuddles the mind and pre- 
vents clear thinking necessary to 
work. There aren’t very many bars, 
and they’re mostly attended by anti- 
quarians. This one was dimly 
lighted in the true tradition, repul- 
sively inefficient. Shirley was sigh- 
ing for the nostalgic New York of 
magnificent bars and restaurants 
she’d read about in history books. 
She fell to talking to the bartender 

84 



who was a hoarse-voiced old baboon 
of an Irishman, who obviously 
drank his own wares. 

“Look what this dag-nabbed 
Thompson Probe has went and 
did,” he said. “It’s went and elimi- 
nated sex.” He leaned over the bar 
and winked at Shirley and pinched 
her .soft arm. “Take you now, 
Ma’m. In the old days you would’ve 
been a knockout.” 

“How did they went and elimi- 
nate .sex?” asked Shirley, innocently 
cuddling forward on the ancient 
bar stool. 

“Like Freud went and said,” said 
the bar-keep. “You take a baby, 
well, that little child is curious 
about hissclf. Right?” 

“Right?” asked Shirley of me, 
sipping her drink. 

“Right,” I said glumly. I was 
thinking back to the day I met 
Nora. She was doing a study on 
“Stimulants and the Creative 
Mind.” In those days ten years 
ago she was merely a bright student 
and I was a thorough-going anti- 
quarian. I spent a lot of time in the 
bars. I had a chip on my shoulder 
against the world. The Thompson 
Probe that everybody used gave me 
a headache and I was way behind 
my friends in achievement. I was 
probably headed for a Clinic, but 
Nora saved me. She was always one 
to improve the world. Maybe she 
thought .she could remake me. Any- 
way, she tried hard for ten years. 

“That baby is curious about his 
body,” said the bartender. “Then 
about his mother's body and finally 
about others. So he goes and grows 
up and this curiosity went and got 
sublimated.” 

“At Sublimation Junction,” I 
said remembering an old tune and 

R. E. BANKS 



letting the bubbles from the drink 
ping at my nose. 

“You know a big joke?” said the 
bartender. “You take an adult, a 
scientist. You take a big-dome, like 
Dr. Deveriiig oi- even this Nora 
Remington Singer dame tliese 
giant brain tyires. all they're doing 
is being sublimated. Scientific curi- 
osity is just a final result of the same 
old curiosity the kid had in his cra- 
dle. So what do they mean, giving 
papers on how to count up the 
]3aint dots on some picture, painted 
by some old-timer?” 

Shirley grinned at me. “So what 
do they mean, Hal? These Nora 
Remington types?” 

“The Thompson Prove allows 
total sublimation,” I said del'eieive- 
ly. “Freud pointed out the los> and 
gain factor in sublimation. Without 
sublimation, civilization couldn't 
exist. Of course, the primitive in- 
stincts continue to exist. Except that 
now the sex-drive is mostly swal- 
lowed in the curiosity sublimation. 
That’s why a body that shows the 
effect of work is attractive, and a 
smooth, unmarked one like yours 
isn’t.” 

“You’re mighty ugly, sister,” said 
the bar-keep, chucking Shirk'v un- 
der the chin. 

“You're prettv ugh xoiu^elf. 
Grandpa,” said Shirley. She sighed 
and took my arm. “Come on, Hal, 
let’s go.” 

For a minute in the dim light she 
looked pretty good, and I thought 
that maybe she had a ch.ince, hut 
when we came out into the sun 
again, the clean, wind-blown look 
spoiled it. 

“What about marriage and chil- 
dren,” she said. “Gosh, I hope the 
Earth men still believe in children.” 

THE WORK-OUT PLANET 



“Of course we do,” I said. “But 
the begetting is unimportant. It is 
simply inefficient to make such a 
fuss over mating as our ancestors 
did. Think of the total loss in terms 
of wasted work lujurs. Tndav those 
hours aie moie re.oonahh- ^pi nt in 
either job work or ieisure-worl; or 
in a dreamless sk e|).” 

“No dreams. Hal?" 

“No. Afii-r j tlay undei- the 
Thompson Picihe, you slee]j like a 
stone.'’ 

She looked disturljed. “I see it.” 
she said. “A New ^'ork .is neat :is a 
pin, efficient and happy. But I still 
don’t sec why — why do you revel in 
work?” 

“Read history,” I said. “There 
was a lime cvhen our technology 
exceeded the knowledge of the man 
on the street. Finally, beginning 
with the atom, it got so b.id th.it 
the average man no longei tiusted 
himself to make decisions in hi.s 
own em ironment. He had a tli siie 
to know as much as the scientist 
himself knew. So science gave him 
the Thompson Probe.” 

She wrinkled her nose and 
showed her provincial prejudices. 
“Probe-smobc. I’m glad the Probe 
is outlawed on Mats.” 

“When .Mars h.o enough books, 
labs and libraries they'll cotne to 
use the Probe,” I said. 



W E FOUND Mr. DuPres in. 

He was shuffling some p.ipers 
on his desk and he looked \ery 
grave. For tlie hundredth time that 
day I had a feeling of misgis iiig. I 
didn’t like tlie legal looking docu- 
ments lie had in front of him. 

“I'm afraid I ha\e 'ome bad 
news for you, Mr. Singer,” he said. 

85 



I waved a hesitant Shirley into 
the chair. After all, she was one 
of the family. 

“Go ahead, DuPres.” 

He had a cringing look on his 
face. He handed me a paper. It 
was a divorce notice. It said that, 
due to my failure to support her, 
Nora Remington Singer, plaintiff, 
had decided to terminate our mar- 
riage and that she wished to collect 
fifteen thousand dollars from me 
which was the basic amount I 
should’ve brought home to support 
us in the ten years of our marriage. 
Fifteen hundred a year isn’t very 
much but the law set the base very 
low and then insisted on it. In a 
world of work, of course, non-sup- 
port is an ugly word, and 1 felt a 
cold clutch of horror. 

“Nora wanted me to break the 
word to you,” said DuPres. “She 
just called me a few minutes ago.” 
“I’ll fight it!” 

“You can’t,” he said. “The evi- 
dence is all here. Affidavits from 
her friends telling of her mental 
distress at having a stupid husband. 
Why, it isn’t even a case for a 
human judge. I’m putting the 
evidence into the Computer Court 
at nine Monday. By ten-thirty she’ll 
have her final decree.” 

“I’ll cross-file!” I cried. 

“The machines would throw out 
your case as soon as it scanned your 
salary reports. No, your marriage is 
dead. The important question now 
is — how can you raise the fifteen 
thousand dollars you owe Nora.” 
“It’s Ryder,” I fumed. “He’s a 
high-erg man. That’s all she wants. 
A goddam high-erg man.” 

“The court will most certainly 
demand fifteen thousand dollars of 
non-support money for Nora,” said 

86 



DuPres insistently. “Have you any 
ideas, Mr. Singer?” 

“I can lend you fifteen thousand 
dollars,” said Shirley impulsively. 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” I said. 

“I don’t think she’s ridiculous.” 
said DuPres. “Why don’t you bor- 
row the money from her?’’ 

“I couldn’t pay it back. I can 
hardly support myself on Earth.” 

“On Mars it would lu‘ different,” 
said Shirley. “If you decided to 
come to Mars, you could get a fine 
job. .” 

“No. I don’t want to go to Mars. 
Besides, you’ve brought your money 
as a dowry, in hopes of finding a 
young man.” 

DuPres cleared his throat. “.\s 
a matter of fact,” he said, “I be- 
lieve my client, Nora, had some- 
thing like this in mind. She men- 
tioned to me something about your 
coming to Earth to find a husband. 
And she mentioned the money you 
had. And Mr. Singer will be free 
of all marital engagements, effec- 
tive at ten o’clock Monday morn- 
mg. 

We both stared at him in amaze- 
ment. Shirley blushed. Nora had 
fit the pieces together in a very 
efficient, non-emotional way. 

DuPres now brought out anotlier 
piece of papi'r. “This marriage li- 
cense is properly filled out,” he 
said, “and needs only the signa- 
tures. I have a friend, a parson, 
whose offices are in the next build- 
ing. We could wrap this whole 
thing up in a matter of minutes.” 

He smiled benignly as if he had 
just put over a big deal. 

“You forgot one thing,” I said. 

“Oh, don’t worry about the li- 
cense,” said DuPres. “It’s dated for 
Monday. The law will recognize 

R. E. BANKS 




the principle of convenience of 
ceremony, regardless of the stream 
of time.” 

I stepped up and let him have 
one on the jaw. He went over back- 
wards in his swivel chair. 

“My compliments,” I said, “and 
you forgot that people have feel- 
ings.” 

Shirley and I stood on the side- 
walk outside. 

“Sure you won’t borrow?” she 
asked. 

“No. I’m not through with Nora 
yet.” 

I made a signal for the car and 
it came gliding up. I got in the 
car and she squeezed my arm. 
“Take care of your good right arm. 
The way you hit that man was 
the finest thing I’ve seen on Earth.” 

“Aren’t you going back?” I 
asked. 

“No,” she smiled. “I’ve got a 
date with an old-fashioned bar- 
tender and a bottle of liquor.” 

I watched her go, head back, 
her ugly, over-womanly body 
swinging in a hippy walk. Let 
science pile invention on invention, 
I thought, there is always the 
eartliy primitive oriented to breed- 
ing. 

I was half-way home when a 
brilliant idea hit me with a flash. 
It was so good that I cried out in 
amazement. There was still a way 
to prove myself to Nora, better 
than finishing my einsteins or bet- 
ter than cornering her with an 
emotional appeal. She hated the 
waste energy of an emotional ap- 
peal anyway. 

Nora was stumped on how to 
distinguish the dust molecules from 

THE WORK-OUT PLANET 



paint molecules on her Mathemati- 
cal Point-Count System. 

“Hal,” I told myself, “Hal you’ve 
never done well under the Thomjj- 
son Probe. But now, son, you’ve 
got to come up with it.' You’ve got 
to show them this time, or else — " 

A LOT of poetics have been de- 
voted to the Probe because of 
the marvelous things it’s done for 
humanity. Actually it always looked 
to me like no more than a paint 
spray gun, and it worked as simply. 

The Thompson Probe is a prac- 
tical solution of man’s oldest wi.sh 
— to make available to himself the 
enormous mental energy he knows 
lies sleeping below the surface of 
every human mind. It emits non- 
thermal radiation which is played 
on the head and shoulders. This 
radiation is on the wave scale 
somewhere between visible light 
and ultra-violet. Thomp.son’s spec- 
trum, if you prefer, in which visible 
light is beginning to turn into 
something else before it becomes 
ultra-violet. It is very unstable, but 
it will radiate up to several hun- 
dred feet and for x number of 
hours before it loses shape and falls 
back into light rays or gains pulsa- 
tions and moves up to ultra-violet. 

(Is there anyone who hasn’t ex- 
perienced the foolish feeling of be- 
ing in the middle of serious work 
and having the commutator in the 
Probe fail? Then your desire for 
work drains out of you and you’re 
staring fooli.shly at a beam of use- 
less light. Or, on the other hand, 
your commutator goes wild and 
burns the hell out of you — you get 
a sunburn strong enough to send 
you to bed for days.) 



87 



But when the Probe works prop- 
erly it literally forces increased ac- 
tivity in the atoms of the brain. 
Perhaps the molecules creak and 
snap a bit, perhaps that’s why we 
don’t live as long — but to feel the 
pure energy of your full mind re- 
leased for work — Ah, that is life’s 
greatest pleasure! 

I took out the set bar and 
moved up the generator. I moved 
it way up. The Probe is theoretical- 
ly safe to handle the high meta- 
bolism rates of the very quick- 
minded, but any child can kick off 
the governor. No one in our in- 
telligent world does, of course. But 
this was emergency. I set up the 
power level as high as it would go, 
way beyond the last safety factor, 
even for the highest metabolic 
genius. I felt some misgivings, but 
I had gotten myself into an all-or- 
nothing situation, and I restrained 
an impulse to fudge a little. 

I rushed in and got Nora’s 
papers on the dot count of the sur- 
face of pictures. She had all of her 
papers out, because, she had told 
me, she had been asked to donate 
them to tlic Museum. Now I knew 
better. She was simply breaking up 
housekeeping. 

I went to the study and turned 
on the Probe and stepped into its 
rays. By midnight when Nora and 
Bob got home from the meeting 
they were going to find a little 
surprise waiting for them. 

I’m used to standard Probe ef- 
fects as is everyone on earth. But 
the blue-white jolt I got dazed me, 
even while I felt my mind turn 
over and the racing energy come 
with a Jolt. I yapped and yam- 
mered like a lap dog because I was 
so jagged up. The thoughts cas- 

88 



caded in my mind and the head- 
ache-producing equations seemed 
to draw up on the paper and re- 
solve themselves into marks as 
simple as “if I have four apples — ” 

Experiments were called for. All 
of the stuff was within the ray’s 
beams, and I set up and activated 
a dozen different experiments at 
once. My hands flew as fast as my 
mind. I could feel my mind racing 
past the first fatigue and slipping 
down into a vast void of concen- 
tration. I worked like a very de- 
mon and muttered and laughed 
and quivered all over from the un- 
accustomed heavy charge of the 
Thompson Probe. 

I got some of the feeling a work- 
out must have. The human mind- 
body stretched to the very limit of 
endurance. The nausea of fatigue 
grew like a round, black balloon. 
Yet I drove myself forward, lights 
blurred in my eyes and I was 
blinded and yet I could still work 
and I worked — 



N ora and Bob discovered me 
around midnight when they 
got home. I was lying twitching 
on the desk while my experiments 
rattled on unheeded and the paper 
tapes I had fed into the machine 
went on rattling out long equa- 
tions. I had received an overload 
of energy and run into a sort of 
human short-circuit, being too 
young for a real work-out to death. 
But not, I thought with pleasure, 
before I had done some consider- 
ably good work. The last thing I 
remembered was when they put 
me to bed. 

We are all doctors because 
everything short of surgery is fairly 

R. E. BANKS 




easy for an alert mind to pick up. 
When I awoke about noon on Sun- 
day, I instantly knew that it was 
going to take me a long time to 
recover from niy efforts. Never- 
theless, I was content. I crept 
downstairs in anticipation. 

I found Shirley in the living 
room assembling her luggage. She 
looked very white and used up. 
“Try to find a hangover remedy 
in this lousy city,” she moaned. 
“I’m glad I can still make the two 
o’clock rocket.” 

“Leaving?” 

“I’ve gotten everything I wanted 
out of my trip. So I leave.” 

“How was last night?” 

“We got drunk and sang old 
songs,” she said, “and I flirted 
with an antiquarian.” 

“Wherc'rc Nora and Bob?” 
Shirley shook her head. “I don’t 
know. But there’s a note on the 
breakfast table.” 

I crept into the breakfast room. 
Nora’s note was to the point: 

Dear Hal: A noble try. In all 
your years you’ve never done such 
a brillianl piece of work. But in 
your usual unobservant fashion 
you picked the wrong set of equa~ 
lions. You solved a problem I 
worked on years ago which has to 
do with paint coatings on build- 
ings and the weathering effects. If 
you had the intelligence to have 
read rny books, you’d have known. 

P.S. Shirley has given me the 
non-support money. I think she 
was drunk. She murmured .some- 
thing about buying a man with a 
good right arm. / hope you’ll be 
very happy together. 

P.P.S. You’re wrong about Bob 
and me. I’ve always envied Bob 

THE WORK-OUT PLANET 



his freedom of living alone. I’m 
going to be a bachelor too. You 
can get more ivork done. Goodbye 
— Nora Remington. 

I dragged myself into the living 
room w'herc Shirley had just fin- 
ished calling for a cab. 

“You gave Nora the money,” I 
accu.sed her. 

“I sav('d enough for your ticket 
to Mars,” she said. 

“I’m not going to Mars.” 

She grinned and waved a paper 
at me. “This says you have to. Old 
DuPres came In this morning and 
drew it up. You owe me fifteen 
thousand. I can offer you a job 
from which you can pay it back. 
The law says you either have to 
have your own job or take the job 
I offer or go to a readjustment 
Clinic for mental incompetence. 
And I don’t think you can find a 
job here very easily, nor allow 
yourself to be sent to a Clinic.” 

I groaned. “I won’t be bought 
like a side of beef!” 

“Now, Hal, what a thing to say! 
Your bags are packed, thanks to 
Nora. Do you want to come quiet- 
ly or shall I send for the police?” 
What could I do? 1 was legally 
trapped and physically weak. 

M y SEATMATE on the Mars 
rocket was an antiquarian. 
Each day Shirley brought me to 
the Solarium to enjoy the sun and 
left me neatly tucked in under the 
blankets. Each time this fellow 
would stare at her and then at me 
and then dig into the books and 
magazines he carried. Finally he 
spoke.

inp clifTercncc — anything: but the 
inincl-sappinp sameness that had 
driven him to the petition. 

Allen was careful not to brush 
against any girl with an escort. 
Since he wasn’t on the make, what 
would be the use of fighting? Kind 
of an odd feeling, though, to know 
you’d never date or fight again, 
or. Or what? What else was 
there to do, if you hadn't the luck 
to be a jobinan or a tech? You ate, 
and slept, and preened, and e.xer- 
cised, and found what pleasure 
you could, and fought mostly be- 
cause it was niomentarilv stimu- 
lating. and. eventually, after a hun- 
dred and fifty years or so, you died. 

Unless you were a tedi. If you 



were a tech. Government gave you 
stuff to keep you alive longer. A 
jobman got a somewhat different 
deal — he got nothing to keep him 
alive abnormally, because ninety 
percent of Karth’s population was 
waiting for his job anyway. 

Allen skirled a huge fountain 
throwing colored, scintillant spray 
high into the dark summer sky, 
stealing a glance backward over his 
shoulder. That girl was still behind 
him. Following him? It wouldn’t 
be anything new. in his case — es- 
pecially in his own sector — but 
maybe she just happened to be 
going his way. 

It would be easy to find out. He 
circled tlie fountain twice. With 






her looks she should have been 
picked up before she’d left her 
compartment building block — ex- 
cept that whoever got her might 
have to fight more than once dur- 
ing the evening to hold her. Def- 
initely a young mati’s darling. 

And, the way it began to look, 
definitely Allen’s darling. On the 
second trip around, she had back- 
tracked to meet him face to face — 
her purpose obvious. 

He tried to dodge, but there was 
no way it could be done without 
insult. Damn. 

“Hi, brute. Nedda Marsh. 
Alone?” She ran soft hands along 
the hard biceps under his short 
jacket sleeves. The motion threw 
open her shriekingly bright orange 
cloak, displaying saucy breasts, 
creamy abdomen and, beneath her 
brief jeweled skirt, long smooth 
thighs. And the perfume assailed 
his nostrils with almost physical 
force. 

“Hi, Nedda. Allen Kinderwood. 
Alone, natch.” Natch, hell. But 
what could any male do to combat 
Government perfume? He smiled, 
his pulse suddenly quickening. 
“Date, darling?” She was a beauti- 
ful thing. 

Her large, sparkling eyes showed 
pleasure. “Take me, Al.” She 
touched vivid red lips lightly 
again.st his. And the formula was 
complete. Private citizens Allen 
Kinderwood and Nedda Marsh 
were dated at least until dawn — 
or a better man did them part. 

He sc|ueezed her arm where 
she’d snuggled it against his side, 
starting with her away from the 
fountain. “How come the most 
gorgeous thing in Kansas City 
wasn’t dated earlier?” 

92 



She looked up at him, and the 
passion in her gaze made his heart 
skip like a teener’s. “Could be I’m 
very particular, darling, but,” her 
look was suddenly beseeching, “the 
truth is. I’m protected.” 

A slow, tiny fire of distaste 
fanned itself alive in Allen’s brain. 
Why in the name of World Gov- 
ernment did every other girl who 
made first play with him have to 
be protected? But there was his 
out. By unwritten social code 
he could declare the date off. Ex- 
cept that he had grown to increas- 
ingly hate the spiteful practice of 
‘protection’. It meant Nedda had 
peeved some local lothario who, 
along with other males in his 
clique, was going to damn well see 
she wasn’t intimate with anyone 
else until she begged another date 
with the original one. If you had 
a sadistic turn of mind, it meant 
you could keep a delectable bit in 
freeze until her natural inclinations 
forced her into your arms. But 
you’d have to fight any man who 
tried to date her in the mean- 
time. 

Fighting was legal, of course, as 
long as the loser was surgically re- 
pairable, and it was considered a 
normal catharsis for strained rela- 
tionships between males. 

Not, Allen thought glumly, that 
he had any stake in the future of 
frantically weary society, but he 
had reached the conclusion long 
ago that a man without the cour- 
age to back up his personal convic- 
tions wasn’t worth the energy it 
took to down him. 

He stopped and held Nedda 
against him protectively. “I still 
want the date, sprite,” he said. “I 
have to leave early tomorrow, but 

ARTHUR DEKKER SAVAGE 




ni try to get you out of protection 
— okay?” 

Her lips trembled. “Oh, yes. If 
you knew how it’s been, these 
last few days — ” 

He shook her again, but more 
tenderly. “Deal. We’ll try to reach 
your compartment.” Living quar- 
ters were a sanctuary no one but 
a medic could legally enter without 
invitation. He removed his stain- 
less indentiheation plaque and 
slipped its chain about her throat. 
“If you see any of the guys who’re 
watching for you, tell me but don’t 
look at them.” He took her arm 
again and alertly began to work 
through the throng. “Describe your 
protector.” 

“Jeff Neal-Haync. He’s big, Al. 
Bigger than you. Heavier, but 
you’ve got muscles like he never 
saw. You look faster, too.” 

Allen didn’t know him, but the 
name was revealing. Not that any- 
thing but your Earth society num- 
ber was official, but use of a double 
surname meant your father had 
elected to stay with your mother 
for at least a while after you were 
bom. Most babies, of course, were 
immediately turned over to a Gov- 
ernment creche, but it had always 
seemed to Allen that kids raised by 
one or more parents had other ad- 
vantages too, although he had 
never been able to figure out just 
what they were. Maybe it was only 
his imagination. 

A t the edge of the park they 
^ chose the nearest double 
scooter which showed full battery 
charge. 

Allen leaned against the for- 
ward rail. “Herd it, will you, Ned- 

D P 



da? Every time I think of the 
hundreds of hours I’ve spent plow- 
ing air with one of these gut- 
weighted things I want to break 
one. Hell, I can run faster. Any- 
way, you know where we’re going.” 
The girl smiled, pushed the 
power lever into forward range and 
steered into slow-moving traffic. “I 
saw a man lift a single, once, but 
that’s all he was able to do with 
it.” 

The lighted street seemed in- 
tensely bright after the dimmer 
reaches of the park. “Ever think 
of running one into the river?” 
She looked at him in amaze- 
ment. “Fright, no. Why — you’d 
have to drive along a pedestrian 
path for at least a block to reach 
the bank!” Ncdda spun the steer- 
ing wheel to avoid a long string of 
solemn teeners playing follow the 
leader on singles. “You have funny 
thoughts, Al.” 

“I’m laughing.” He flexed his 
muscles, impatient, as usual, with 
another citizen’s sluggish menta- 
tion. “I suppose the damn music 
never gets on your nerves, either?” 
“Music? Oh — the music.” She 
listened as though for the first time 
to the muted strains which played 
continuously throughout the city — 
calming, soothing, lulling. “Of 
course not. Why should it?” 
“They’ve got it synchronized,” 
said Allen. “Govcmineut’s got it 
synchronized so you hear it just 
the same volume no matter where 
you are outside. You have to listen 
to it.” 

“Darling, ycjur boredom’s show- 
mg. 

He squeezed her hand reassur- 
ingly. “Don’t let me spin you, love- 
ly. I’ve got the answer.” 



93 




“Oh?” 

“Yeah. I applied for a DP this 
morning.” 

“Al— no.'” 

“Why not?” He put it like the 
noodle thrust of a fighting knife, 
daring her to find- a reason, half 
hoping she could. 

“I — ” She glanced at him once, 
quickly, then away. Then she drew 
a deep breath and let it sigh out. 
“How about Mars, Al? There 
aren’t many service machines, and 
they even let women do lots of little 
detailed things. 1 almost went, 
once.” 

He was watching her shrewdly. 
“Why didn’t you?” He had fought 
this one out with himself before. 

“Oh — I don’t know, fust never 
did.” 

“I’ll tell you why you really 
didn’t. It’d be too different. When 
the Government provides every 
convenience, every comfort you can 
think of here, you can’t stand hav- 
ing to work in a mine, with an 
oxygen helmet, stuffed into heavy 
clothes. You can’t stand the danger 
and the fear — and somehow, in- 
side, you must know it. I’m pretty 
strong, and I never met a man I 
was afraid of, but I know I 
couldn’t stand Mars.” He gripped 
the rail and stared out over the 
wide, swarming street. “But Earth 
is a trap, Nedda. A big, comfort- 
able trap where you walk around 
endlessly without being any use at 
all.” 

She trod the brake and barely 
missed bumping a couide who had 
stopped to embrace. “I’m some use, 
hon. Wait’ll we get home.” Her 
eyes held a promise she could 
barely restrain. 

Automatically, he caressed her 

94 



with a practiced hand — and 

grabbed the wheel when she sud- 
denly strained against him, trem- 
bling, pressing eager lips against 
his neck. 

Christ, how long had she been 
protected? He felt a mounting 
anger against the social ennui which 
drove men’s minds to such inhuman 
activity. Departure was the only 
escape from this kind of thing, and 
from the city — from any city. 

But the Departees had always 
been only a tiny minority. Did that 
mean they — and he- — were wrong? 
He brooded about it for seemingly 
the googolth time, guiding the 
scooter without conscious thought, 
turning as Nedda directed. 

A trap, he’d told her. Well, he 
could .see no reason to change that. 
The blazingly glorious senso- 
theaters, cafes, gymnasiums, danc- 
ing salons, amusement rides and 
hypnodream houses, crowding every 
main thoroughfare with their fan- 
tastically ornate architecture, were 
— when you thought about it — de- 
signed to trap people’s minds, keep 
them from thinking of anything but 
a gossamer, useless pursuit of per- 
.sonal pleasure. And wasn’t the de- 
sign faulty when everyone was 
bored, when some chose Departure 
and others sank to the unnatural 
practice of protection to whet their 
sated appetites? 

Nor was there any apparent hope 
for the future. Theatre productions, 
dream tapes, even the elaborate 
home teleview shows were all his- 
torical. Why? Was Government ad- 
mitting there was nothing but stale- 
ness in the present? Why the con- 
cern with backtime? 

Because of Government enter- 
tainment diet, Allen could prob-

ably, with a bit of practice, fish 
skillfully from an outrigger, make 
and use a longbow exp>ertly, run a 
store profitably in the Money Ages, 
weave cloth correctly, build com- 
plete wooden houses — oh, any num- 
ber of ancient things. 

But he couldn’t even talk the 
same language as the relative hand- 
ful of trained men who built and 
operated the unbelievably intricate 
robomachinery which activated and 
maintained the complex cities of 
Earth. 



N EDDA’S soft voice broke into 
his thoughts. “A1 — Dan Hal- 
gersen’s coming up behind us on a 
single. He’s one of JefT’s^ — ” 

“Hold on.” Allen swung the 
scooter hard right and adroitly 
darted across traffic toward an em- 
blazoned theatre entrance. Here, 
now, was a situation he knew how 
to deal with. He said rapidly, out 
of the side of his mouth, “Jump 
off when I stop at the entry and kiss 
me like good-by. Register your 
plaque in the ID slot and head for 
the door — then look back. If I’m 
down, go on in and lose yourself. If 
he’s down, come back.” 

He made a wrenching stop at 
the very edge of the crowd, swung 
Nedda through the opening be- 
tween front and side rails and gave 
her a hard, sterile kiss. 

She clung to him a moment. 
Without letting her eyes stray she 
said, “Slowing down right behind 
you. Luck, lover.” Then she turned 
and started to pick her way across 
the walk. 

Allen swung the scooter in a fast, 
tight circle to the left. Assuming his 
opponent to be right-handed, this 

96 



would help avoid a knife slash from 
the rear if the other rammed his 
scooter — further assuming the man 
had not been tricked into thinking 
his presence was unnoticed. 

He hadn’t. When Allen whipped 
his head around to look at him, 
there was barely time to brake the 
heavier double to avoid a shrewdly 
planned collision. Halgersen, Nedda 
had said. He was thick-set, with 
heavy brows and large jaw. The 
type Allen had learned to asso- 
ciate with power and endurance 
but not too much speed. 

Halgersen was holding a knife 
in his right hand. Allen quickly 
slipped his own blade from the 
sheath conveniently held at the 
front of his belt. They cut intricate 
patterns of feint, attack and with- 
draw, using passing vehicles as 
buffers. But not for long. 

A voice from the crowd called, 
“Fight!” and space grew miracu- 
lously about the combatants, leav- 
ing a huge clearing in the street 
rimmed solidly with scooters and 
pedestrians. A few shouts of en- 
couragement began to be heard as 
individuals selected one or the other 
of the men as a likely winner. 

Allen dodged a sudden attempt 
at a side-swipe collision and the 
attendant vicious swipe of Halger- 
sen’s blade — and then drew first 
blood by a lightning riposte to the 
arm. Legal knife target was arm, 
leg, abdomen and a forehead cut 
without thrust — which would ob- 
scure vision with blood without do- 
ing organic damage. 

The bright yellow luminescence 
of a police copter dropped and 
hovered as Allen tried to follow up 
his momentary advantage. The 
scene, he knew, would now be 

ARTHUR DEKKER SAVAGE 



simultaneously filmed for possible 
legal record and broadcast on all 
teleview news programs. Enter- 
tainment for adults, education for 
the teeners. 

A feminine voice in the front 
ranks called, “Two stunts to one 
on green jacket!” and was immedi- 
ately taken up by another girl near 
by. 

He had little time to think with 
satisfaction that no female had ever 
been forced to pay off a bet of some 
ingeniously embarrassing public be- 
havior on his account. Halgersen 
was now trying to maneuver him for 
a straight ram which would bring 
them definitely together. He wasn’t 
being w'eakened by the slow drip of 
blood from his arm and he didn’t 
seem to be bothered by pain. 

And then they were close to the 
circle rim. Allen swung his scooter 
so the cooling downdraft from the 
copter — coming from above the 
center of the cleared area — was di- 
rectly against his back, a method 
he had devised for knowing his po- 
sition without having to take his 
eyes from a close opponent. He let 
his shoulders droop suddenly, as 
though he was tired, and at the 
murmur of disappointment from 
many onlookers he began to back 
slowly aw'ay from Halgersen. 

The blue-jacketed figure rolled 
into the trap scowling. He tried 
again for a head-on ram. Allen let 
him come, and at the last possible 
instant, when Halgersen would be 
unable to reverse, stop, or even 
swerve, he flipped the bar to full 
power ahead. And braced himself 
accordingly. 

The scooters met with a bone- 
jarring thud of perimeter rubber. 
Halgersen was hurled neatly over 

D P 



his own guard rail to land gaspingly 
across Allen’s. 

Allen grasped the back of the 
other’s belt in a grip that had dis- 
mayed many a combatant, hauled 
him into position and hamstrung 
both legs with two ck'xtrous thrust- 
arid-cut mov'emciits. It took but a 
moment longer to leap above a 
desperate slash at his own legs, 
drag the heavier man to the thick 
floor of the scooter and render him 
unconscious with a stamping kick 
of one sandaled hei'l. It left an 
easy repair job for the medics, but 
would keep one Dan Halgersen 
from fighting again for more than 
a week — and maybe make him 
think twice about joining in an- 
other protection pact. 

Allen leaped up and balanced on 
two guard rails while the police 
copter settled down to pick up 
Halgersen. He signaled Nedda to 
move on along the walkway. 

While the onlookers were clap- 
ping approval of the show, he re- 
moved Halgersen’s plaque, leaped 
down and dodged an attempted 
ki.ss from the girl who had given 
odds on him — glancing back warily 
in case her escort felt insulted — 
then pushed through the mob to 
join Nedda. 

She hugged his arm ecstatically. 
“Darling, every woman .should have 
a guy like you.” 

“Yeah.” He felt no sense of tri- 
umph. It had happened too many 
times before. Everything had hap- 
pened too many times before — 
repetitive, palling and purposeless. 
He tucked the won plaque into her 
decorative belt. It was Nedda’s 
proof that protection was ended, 
and Halgersen would have to call 
for it accompanied by a witness. 



97 



“Where the hell is your place?” 
he asked. For a moment he won- 
dered why he didn’t just turn 
abruptly and leave her, social mores 
notwithstanding. Then Nedda's 
perfume began its chemical magic 
again, and he carefully straightened 
his jacket and set his forelock in 
its proper place. 

N EDDA,” he accused lazily, 
“you’re a nymph. Ever tried 
psychoconditioning?” 

She gave him a tender, lingering 
kiss and burrowed more com- 
fortably in his arms. “Not yet, 
darling. Would you prefer me less 
— responsive?” 

Allen patted her as carefully as 
possible to show approval without 
arousing her again. “No man 
Would. But it must be rough be- 
tween dates, isn’t it?” And just why 
should he be worrying about any- 
one else at this stage of the game? 
Maybe he wasn’t. Maybe he was 
just curious now that it no longer 
mattered. 

She avoided his eyes in the cool 
semigloom of the compartment. “I 
— usually manage to have enough 
dates. Until some moron like Neal- 
Hayne puts me under protection.” 
He disengaged himself gently, 
rolled off the pliant couch and in- 
creased the room’s light with the 
wall knob. “You should register a 
complaint, Ncdda. After three he’ll 
be forcibly ijsyched, you know.” He 
dialed the servoconsole and focused 
a morning meal menu on the view- 
screen. “Ready for breakfast, pip?” 
“Mmin — if you are.” Nedda 
came over and lifted the phone 
from its panel recess. “That num- 
ber she algal protein is supposed 

98 



to be a new taste sensation. Like?” 
He shrugged. “Let’s try it. It’ll 
be my last go at this robot feed.” 
When the meals had been de- 
posited in the service chute she 
looked at him pleadingly. “Hon, 
why don’t you try being psyched? 
They could make you satisfied with 
— things as they are.” 

Allen lifted a thin transparent 
food cover while he shook his head. 
“Maybe they could, Nedda. But it 
would have to be almost total era- 
sure to change my slant on every- 
thing, and being forced to accept 
what I hate is worse than anything 
else I can think of. It wouldn’t be 
me when they got through. What- 
ever causes me to think like I do is 
the me, and that’d be gone.” 

Some of the resentful animosity 
surged up in him and he had to 
talk about it. “Look at your com- 
partment. The same as every other 
single in the city— or any city. The 
walls arc the shade of green that’s 
best for the eyes. Furniture and fi.\- 
tures are always the same colors. 
Every compartment has a servo- 
console to condition the air, control 
the temperature and humidity, 
bring you food or any other stand- 
ard service, provide teleview 
shows, music or requests. You 
could live your life inside this 
square hole. Eveiybody has every- 
thing and nothing means anything 
— can’t you sec that?” 

She came around the table and 
sat on his lap with her head against 
his neck. “No, presh, but if you’ll 
change your mind about a DP you 
can date me any time, always. I’d 
like to share a double with you for- 
ever.” 

He traced soothing circles on 
her smooth back with his finger- 

ARTHUR DEKKER SAVAGE 




tips. “That’s the closest I’ve ever 
come to owning anything,” he 
mused. 

“But hon, Government owns 
everything and takes care of every- 
thing. When you can always use 
a thing, how could it be better if 
you owned it?” 

Allen held her against him tight- 
ly, fighting the old fight to find 
words. How could you explain how 
you felt things to be right or wrong, 
without really knowing the reasons? 

“Maybe,” he said slowly, “it’s as 
though I wanted to keep you for 
myself alone. But Nedda, if an- 
other man made the right ap- 
proach, could you refuse him?” 
After a minute he repeated, “Could 
you?” 

Eventually, she made two an- 
swers. 

They were warm and wet and 
dropped onto his chest. 

T he adjustment Build- 
ing was a soaring, chastely 
white structure of silicoid plastic, 
dazzling in the hot morning sun. It 
crossed Allen’s mind fleetingly that 
everything built nowadays would 
long outlast the builders. That 
seemed right, but he didn’t know 
why. 

He took his ID plaque from 
Nedda and kissed her. He had tried 
to di.ssuade her from coming with 
him, but she had merely smiled 
and held his arm and urged him 
toward a double scooter. 

“This is it, beautiful,” he said 
shortly, at the entrance. And, with 
an attempt at levity, “Don’t take 
any more protection.” Actually, 
what could you say? He went in- 
side quickly, without looking back. 

D P 



At the door marked Kansas City 
Department of Social Adjustment 
he slipped his plaque into the cor- 
rect slot for a moment and was ad- 
mitted directly to the waiting room 
for those who had appointments 
for the day. 

There was only one other wait- 
ing— a handsome blond youth 
whose knife was new. Allen sat 
down in a lounge chair across the 
room. 

And Nedda came in and sat 
down beside him. 

He could have understood al- 
most anything but that. “How in 
the name of fear — ” 

“Do you think,” she said mis- 
chievously, taking his hand, “the B 
Sector champ is the- only one who 
can get an appointment?” 

Before it could more than flash 
through Allen’s mind that he’d 
not told her that, the blond youth 
was standing before them, his eyes 
hotly on Nedda. Then, obviously 
confused that she was already hold- 
ing hands, he addressed himself to 
Allen as though it was what he had 
intended doing. 

“Marty Bowen, sir. Uh — I’m go- 
ing to see if they’ll let me have a 
double compartment with some 
gym apparatus in it.” He shifted 
his weight to the other foot and 
hung a thumb nervously in his belt, 
unable to keep from darting glances 
at Nedda. 

Allen noted, with rising anger 
and some other unpleasant emotion 
he couldn’t define, that she hadn’t 
dropped her eyes. He said curtly, 
‘“Fine, kid— hope you make it.’’ 
The youth mumbled sometliing else 
and went back to liis chair. 

He had barely seated himself 
when a voder speaker crooned a 

99 



number melodiously. With a quick 
backward glance at Nedda, the 
blond lad went on into the counsel 
room. 

Allen’s mind remained in con- 
fusion, shot through with anger at 
himself that he should waste 
thoughts now on anything but the 
coming interview. The room was 
beginning to fill quietly with others. 

His number was called a few 
minutes later. 

And Nedda’s was called along 
with it. 

Well — the place to get the an- 
swer was the counsel chamber. He 
got up slowly, barely noticing that 
Nedda continued to hold his hand 
as they went in. 

The brilliant room was two 
stories high, with fluted walls and 
no windows. Obviously the size was 
to impress interviewees. But why 
should they have to be impressed? 
Wasn’t the wisdom of the five tech 
doctors sufficient by itself? Wasn’t 
it? 

He sat in a chair indicated by 
the dark-skinned one, and listened 
while the very old one in the center 
talked to Nedda. 

Had dating the B Sector park 
champion solved her difficulty with 
the man she had reported? Fine. 
It was the second such report about 
him in a year — the other also com- 
ing from a girl who was highly 
sexed. Did Nedda not consider her- 
self to have a problem which re- 
quired psychoconditioning? No? 
Well, perhaps in later years, when 
her beauty and her mind were 
somewhat changed. No, there 
would seem to be no justification 
for giving her a compartment in 
another sector, unless she had per- 
suaded the champion or another to 

100 



share a double with her. Would 
that be all? Much happiness to her. 

Abruptly, Allen realized Nedda 
had left and that the frail old man 
was talking to him. 

“. unusual to have joint in- 
terviews without a more definite 
emotional tie, but we felt you would 
like to know how you had rendered 
civic aid.” 

So pitting him without choice 
against any of several men was 
their idea of civic aid. No wonder 
he’d met so many protected girls in 
the past. This time, they’d har- 
nessed Nedda’s restless passion to 
the task of dissuading him from a 
DP. Very neat. 

It made him feel better to know 
they’d failed where he was con- 
cerned. and his resentment abated 
somewhat. He said, “Glad I could 
help,” careful to keep his voice 
emotionless. Then, determined to 
have no further subtleties, “If I 
can have my departure permit, I 
won’t trouble you further.” 

Maybe his approach wasn’t right, 
but all they could do would be to 
refuse him. In which case there 
were other ways — and the hell with 
legality. 

“We hope,” smiled the old doc- 
tor benignly, “there may be an- 
other way. Perhaps, if we discuss 
your problem, we can find a solu- 
tion which won’t cost the city a 
handsome young citizen.” 

Allen made it a direct attack. 
“Why should the city miss any citi- 
zen? In fact, what good is the city 
itself — what good is any city?” 

And almost, the techs seemed 
startled. But a younger one said 
easily, “A city, Mr. Kinderwood, 
pennits a maximum of efficient 
service and pleasure, with a mini- 

ARTHUR DEKKER SAVAGE 



mum of waste and discomfort.” 
Allen leaned back and stubborn- 
ly folded his arms. “I’ve had 
enough of pleasures and comforts 
without meaning, and I’ve nothing 
to do, and it doesn’t look like any- 
one’s making any progress any- 
where. Even on the planets they’re 
just repeating backtime stuff with 
modern equipment.” 

The old man waved a hand at 
the others and looked at Allen in- 
tently. His voice was softly insist- 
ent. “The one continuous thread 
in human history has been the seek- 
ing of more pleasure and greater 
comfort for all members of the 
race. Our technology gives us a 
maximum of both. No one labors, 
and the few who work prefer to do 
so. No one is diseased, no one stays 
in pain longer than the time neces- 
sary to reach a medic. Everyone can 
have everything he needs, without 
striving and without debt. And as 
technology advances, there will be 
even greater benefits for all. What 
more can be done to make the citi- 
zens of Earth happy?” 

For the first time, Allen felt con- 
fused. “I don’t know,” he said 
slowly. “The way you put it, it 
sounds right. But where does it all 
lead? What reason have I got for 
living? What reason does the hu- 
man race have for surviving?” 

The sociologist looked even old- 
er. “In all seriousness, sir, can you 
answer the questions you have just 
asked?” His eyes were expectant — 
but there didn’t seem to be much 
hope reflected in their depths. 

Allen noted a tenseness around 
the table. Why were they asking 
him for answers they were sup- 
posed to know? Or was it another 
of their subtli’ties? 

D P 



“No,” he said curtly, “I don’t 
know the answer to any of them. 
Has it got a bearing on my getting 
a DP?” 

The central figure sighed. “None 
at all.” He pressed several tiny but- 
tons on the polished table and an 
inscribed card rose halfway out of 
a slot. “We merely hope that some 
day a man will come along who 
can tell us — before someone who 
may not be a man comes along and 
makes the answers futile.” He 
handed Allen the card. “Here is 
your permit. You may take it to 
the third office south on the corri- 
dor through that door. We don’t 
feel it is the answer to your prblem, 
but we admit we don’t — ” 

“Pardon me, sir,” interrupted Al- 
len. He wet his lips. “Did you say 
‘someone who may not be a man’?” 

“Yes. It is an aspect you have 
not considered, Mr. Kinderwood.” 
The sociologist’s face seemed hag- 
gard. “Even a few generations ago. 
Earth as it is today would have 
seemed like a concept of heaven. 
We know now it is not enough, but 
we don’t know why. Perhaps, if wc 
can reach the stars the problem will 
cease to be critical. By the same 
token, life from the stars may come 
here first. 

“We have no remotest idea what 
such an eventuality would entail. 
It may provide a solution. It may 
quite conceivably send man back 
to the forests and jungles. 

“You have experienced our only 
answer to the latter possibility. 
While providing man with every- 
thing to which he has aspired for 
milleniums, we instill in him, 
through the media of entertain- 
ment, knowledge of all the survival 
practices known to the backtimers 

101 




who painfully nurtured civilization 
from an embryonic idea to its pres- 
ent pinnacle. We can do no more.” 
Allen flexed his arms involuntar- 
ily at the sheer enormity of die 
idea. It was one thing to let a use- 
less race expire, quite another to 
think of its being forced back to — 
“But — can’t anyone think of any- 
thing else to do?’’ 

“Whoever is capable of devising 
anything else,” the old doctor said 
resignedly, “will undoubtedly be 
able to carry it out with or without 
our assistance.” He pressed more 
buttons and there was a muted 
sound of the voder calling a num- 
ber. “The exit over there, Mr. Kin- 
derwood. And — much happiness.” 
Allen’s thoughts swirled in tu- 
multuous confusion. Dimly, he real- 
ized that man had outstripped him- 
self, and saw with intense bitterness 
that there W'as no answer on Earth 



for any ordinary citizen. Or was 
there? And if there was, was it 
worth trying to find? He flung open 
the door to the corridor violently, as 
though the force could quiet his 
mind. Maybe, if he didn’t u.sc the 
permit, he could stay and figure 
out an arrswer. Nedda would be 
sympathetic and patient while — 
And then he stopped. Across the 
wide hallway, Nedda stood beneath 
a window, looking at him. And the 
blond youth held her with flushed 
understanding, impatiently waiting, 
caressing her arm with his hand, 
binding her to him with the one 
bond she could not break. 

She watched Allen start slowly 
down the corridor. Once, when he 
stumbled, she gave a stifled sob, and 
tears brimmed and spilled silently 
when he passed through the door 
marked Kansas City Department of 
Euthanasia. • • • 



THE WORK-OUT PLANET 

“This chicken is your wife?” he 
asked. 

“Chicken?” 

He handed me an ancient Earth 
magazine. On the cover was the 
picture of a very ugly woman. She 
had been called Marilyn Monroe. 

“That’s a chicken,” he said, 
“like youi-s.” 

1 shrugged. “No, she’s not my 
wife.” 

“If I’m not too curious, what 
are you going to do with her?” 

“It’s what ^e’s going to do with 
me,” I said glumly. “Her father is 
rich and I have to go to work for 
him. As for her, slie has a great 
enthusiasm for archaic items like 
baseball, fine restaurants, bars, 

102

parties and — uh — breeding. I will 
probably have to escort her on 
these functions.” 

His eyes lighted up. “Rich dame, 
good-looking and sexy, likes a 
good time and gets a kick out of 
breeding. Brother, some people 
have all the luck!” 

I sighed. “No. I’d give anything 
to be back in New York, working 
again, doing my einstcins and put- 
ting in a useful eighteen hours a 
day.” 

My scatinate gave me a look of 
disgust and pulled his blankets up 
over his face. He never spoke to 
me again. I can see it’s going to 
be hard to get used to colonial 
thinking. • • .

A GIFT FOR TERRA 



The good Martian Samaritans rescued Johnny Love and of- 
fered him “the stars”. Now, maybe, Johnny didn’t look closely 
enough into the “gift horse’s” mouth, but there were others 
who did . and found therein the answer to life . 



H IS HEAD hurt like blazes, but 
he was alive, and to be alive 
meant fighting like hell to stay that 
way. 

That was the first thing return- 
ing consciousness told h^. The 
next was that his helmet should 
have been cracked wide open when 
the bum landing had wrenched the 
acceleration hammocks out of their 
suspension sockets and heaved his 
suited body across the buckled con- 
ning deck. It should’ve been, but it 
wasn’t. 

The third thing he knew was 
that Ferris’ helmet had been 
smashed into a million pieces, and 
that Ferris was dead. 

Sand sifted in a cold, red river 
through the gaping rent in the side 
of the ship, trying to bury him be- 
fore he could stand up and get his 
balance on the crazily tilted deck. 



He shook loose with more strength 
than he needed, gave the rest of 
the muscles in his blocky body a 
try, and there wasn’t any hurt 
worse than a bruise. Funny. Ferris 
was dead. 

He had a feeling somewhere at 
the edge of his brain that there was 
going to be more to it than just 
checking his o.xygen and food-con- 
centrate supply and walking away 
from the sliip. A man didn’t com- 
plete the first Earth-Mars flight 
ever made, smash his ship to hell, 
and then just walk away from it. 
His astrogcologer-navigator was 
dead, and the planet was dead, so 
a man just didn’t walk away. 

There was plenty of room for 
him to scramble through the yawn- 
ing rip in the buckled hullplates — 
just a matter of crawling up the 
river of red sand and out; it was 



104 








as easy as that. 

Then Johnny Love was on his 
feet again, and the sand clutched 
at his hca\7 boots as though to 
keep him from leaving Ferris and 
the ship, but it didn’t, and he was 
walking away . 

Even one hundred and forty mil- 
lion miles from the Sun, the un- 
filtered daylight was harsh and the 
reflection of it from the crimson 
sand hurt his eyes. The vault of 
the blue-black sky was too high; 
the desert plain w'as too flat and 
too silent, and save for the thin 
Martian wind that whorled deli- 
cately-fluted traceries in the low 
dunes that were the only interrup- 
tion in the flatness, there was no 
motion, and the planet was too still. 

Johnny Love stop|X‘d his walk- 
ing. Even in the lesser gravity, it 



lUustraUd by Paul Orban 





seemed too great an effort to place 
one booted foot before the other. 
He looked back, and the plume of 
still-rising smoke from the broken 
thing that had been his ship was 
like a solid black pillar that had 
been hastily bulk by some evil 
djinn. 

How far had he walked; how 
long? 

He turned his back on the glint- 
ing spec and made his legs move 
again, and there was the hollow 
sound of laughter in his helmet. 
Here he was, Johnny Love, the first 
Martian! and the last! Using the 
last of the strength in his bruised 
body to go forward, when there 
was no forward and no backward, 
no direction at all ; breathing when 
there was no purpose in breathing. 

Why not shut off the valves 
now? 

He was too tired for hysteria. 
Men had died alone before. Alone, 
but never without hope! And here 
there was no hope, for there was no 
life, and no man had ever lived 
where there was not life! 

But he had come to sec, and he 
was seeing, and in the remaining 
hours left to him he would see 
what no man had seen in a half a 
million years. 

Harrison and Janes or Lamson 
and Fowler would not be down for 
twenty days at the inside; that had 
been the time-table. Twenty days, 
twenty years ... he heard himself 
laugh again. Time-table! 

He and Ferris first. Then Harri- 
son and Janes. Then Lamson and 
Fowler, all at twenty-day intervals. 
If all landed safely, they would use 
Exploration Plan I, Condition Op- 
timum. If only two crews made it 
down, Plan II; Condition Limited. 

106 



And if only one made the 273-day 
journey from the orbit of Terra — 
that would be Plan III; Condition 
Untenable, Return. The twenty- 
day interval idea had come from 
some Earth-bound swivel-chair 
genius who had probably never 
even set foot in a Satellite opera- 
tions room. Somebody had im- 
prc.ssed on him when he was young 
that egg-carrying was a safer mis- 
sion with a multiplicity of baskets; 
it was common sense that if any- 
thing happened to Mars-1 touching 
down, at least it wouldn’t happen 
to II and III at the same time. 

Common sense, Johnny thought,' 
and he laughed again. Space was' 
not common, and it was not sensi-' 
ble. And nobody had ever taughti 
it the rules men made. 

He kept svalking, seeing, think-' 
ing and breathing. 

For a long time. He fell once or 
twice and picked himself up again 
to walk some more, and then he 
fell a final time, and did not get 
up. Red sand whispered over him, 
danced lightly, drifted ... 



T he flat, wide-tracked ve- 
hicle swerved in a tight arc, 
throwing up low ruby-colored 
clouds on either side. Its engines 
throbbed a new note of power, and 
it scuttled in a straight line across 
the desert floor like a fleck of shiny 
metal drawn by an unseen magnet. 
Behind it rose a thinning monu- 
ment of green-black smoke, and be- 
tween its tracks was a wavering line 
of indentations in the sand already 
half-obliterated by the weight of 
their own shallow walls. But they 
became deeper as the vehicle raced 
ahead; and then at length they 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



ended, and the vehicle halted. 

There was a mound of sand that 
the winds, in their caprice, would 
not have made alone, for they 
sculptured in a freer symmetry. And 
the child-like figures seemed to 
realize that at once. 

With (piick precision they lev- 
elled the mound and found Johnny 
Love. They took him into their 
vehicle, and deftly matched and 
replenislied the waning gas mixture 
in the cylindrical tanks on his back. 

Then they drove away with him. 

"Ferris?” 

“Ferris was your astrogeologcr- 
navigator. He died when you 
crashed.” 

“Harrison . Janes?” 

“Harrison and Janes are not due 
for nine more days. But you are in 
no danger.” 

There was darkness and warmth ; 
his throat was dr)' and it burned. 
It was hard to talk, and Ferris was 
dead. Harrison and Janes were not 
due for nine more days. Somebody 
said so. Nine more days and then 
everything would be — 

Panic shook him, sent blood 
throbbing to his head and brought 
consciousness back hard. His eyes 
opened and he was suddenly sit- 
ting bolt upright. 

“But Lamson, you were twenty 
days behind — ” .And the racing 
thought froze .solid in his fumbling 
brain. Then there was a torrent of 
thoughts and memory overran 
them, buried them, and red desert 
was rushing up to engulf him. He 
screamed and fell back with his 
hands clawing at his eyes. 

“You are in no danger. You had 
thought our planet lifeless; it was 
an error. We live underground, 

A GIFT FOR TERRA 



John Love. That is why you did 
not see us, or surface indications 
of our existence. A group of us 
speak your language, because for 
eleven days we have been studying 
your brain and analyzing your 
thought-patterns.” 

Johnny was bolt upright again, 
and now his eyes were wide and 
his hands were knotted, and where 
there had been only light and shad- 
ow before there was full sight now. 
Swiftly he was off the low cot and 
on his feet looking for the speaker, 
arms ready to lash out and hit. 

But he was alone in the small, 
sterile-looking chamber, and his 
muscles were so much excess bag- 
gage. He tried to recover his bal- 
ance; he had forgotten about the 
slight gravity. He tried too hard, 
and his body crashed, confused, in- 
to a wall. A — damn them, a padded 
wall! 

He regained his feet. Stood still, 
and raced his eyes about him. 
There it was — above the cot. A 
.small round, shuttered opening — 
some sort of two-way communica- 
tion system. He wondered if they 
could see him, too. If they could, 
that part of it worked only one way. 

“All right, whoever you arc, so 
you’ve analyzed me!” He had to 
direct his sudden anger at some- 
thing, so he shouted at the shut- 
tered aperture. ‘“Now what . .” 

There was silence for a tiny eter- 
nity, and he could feel them prob- 
ing, evaluating him, as a human 
scientist would study a rare species 
in a cage. The feeling ignited a 
new anger in him, and made him 
want to curse the teachings that 
had conditioned his lifetime of 
thinking to the belief that Man 
was more than an animal. 



107 



/He’d been sold short . 

“Damn you! God damn you, 
what arc you going to do to me?” 
In a corner of his mind he was 
aware of a gentle hissing sound, 
but he did not listen. The fear and 
terror had In l)c broken. Make them 
tell, 7iiaki’ them tell . 

His muscles grew heavy and his 
face was feverish with his effort, 
and his eyes stung. Something . 
like roses. But there were no roses 
on dead planets — 

“Earthman, can you still hear?” 
“I can hear,” Johnny said. It 
was suddenly easier to talk. Even 
easier to understand. They had 
done something . 

“We are surprised that your state 
of shock was not more se\ere. In 
the process of analyzing you, we dis- 
covered that you were totally un- 
prepared for Space-Sight, and 
therefore — ” 

“Unprepared? What do you 
think all those months of physical 
conditioning were for? Yeah, and 
all those damned textbooks? You 
think that barrel I cracked up was 
built in a Kindergarten class — ” 
“Space-flight requires but a rela- 
tive minimum of those things, 
Earthman. Required most is psy- 
chological and philosophical condi- 
tioning.” 

“To what?” 

“To all things unreal. Because 
they are the most real; infinity ap- 
plies to probability and possibility 
far moi-e directly than to simple 
Space and Time. But — are you 
calm now?” The voice was grow- 
ing deeper, and seemed almost 
friendly. Johnny tried his muscles; 
they weren’t p<iralyzcd — he could 
move easily, and his head was clear. 
And there was no anger, now. No 

108 



“shock.” 

“Go ahead,” he said. 

“Our examination of you has in- 
dicated that your race is a poten- 
tially effective one, with a superior 
survival factor. We feel that, prop- 
erly instructed and assisted, such a 
race might be of great value as a 
friend and ally. In short, we re- 
ceive you in peace and friendship, 
Earthman. Will you accept us in 
like manner?” 

Johnny tried to think. Hard 
thoughts, the way men were sup- 
jxMed to think. What kind of game 
was it? What were the strings? The 
angles . the gimmicks. What did 
they really want? 

His lips were dry and barely 
moved over his teeth, but the words 
came easily. “Who says you’ie a 
friend?” 

“We would have learned as 
much about you by examining your 
corpse, Earthman.” 

^ he was alive, and that had to 
prove something. And it might have 
been a lot of trouble to keep him 
that way. The hell of it was you 
couldn't know . Anything . 
you couldn’t know anything when 
you were tossed into the middle of 
the impossible. He felt the skin on 
the back of his neck chill and 
tighten. 

But who held out their hand like 
this? 

Whoever did anything like tliat? 

No. 

“We wish to help you. Earth- 
man, and your race. W'e have ob- 
served your kind at close quarters, 
yet we have never landed among 
you nor attempted communication 
because of fear for ourselves. But 
with proper help, there need be no 
fear between us. We offer you 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



friendship and progress.” 

“You keep talking about what 
vue get out of it.” Johnny stared up- 
ward at the ceiling, got his eyes off 
the little shuttered aperture. He 
wished he had a cigarette. “You 
sound too damned much like a 
politician.” 

“Perhaps at this point you should 
be informed that your ship is com- 
pletely repaired, and ready for your 
return to Earth whenever you de- 
sire.” 

“So, it’s — You said Harrison and 
Janis would be here in nine days! 
That means I’ve been out for near- 
ly two weeks! For a nap that’s a 
long time, but nobody could get 
that bucket back in one piece in 
eleven days! Not after what I did 
to it — ” 

“Your ship is completely re- 
paired, Earthman.” 

Johnny knew somehow that the 
voice wasn’t lying. So maybe when 
you got off of Earth miracles did 
happpen. He just didn’t know 
enough. 

“We wish to give you data to 
take back to your Earth which will 
banish disease for you — all disease. 
Data which will give you space- 
craft that match our own in tech- 
nical perfection. Data that will 
make you the undisputed masters 
of your environment. We offer you 
the stars, Earthman.” 

He shut a thousand racing 
thoughts out of his head. “Maybe 
I’ll believe this fairy tale of yours 
on one condition,” Johnny said, 
“because I can’t intelligently do 
otherwise.” 

“And that — condition?” 

“Tell me why.” 

There was a pause, and it was 
as though something forever un- 

A GIFT FOR TERRA 



knowable to men hung in the si- 
lence. 

“Picture, if you can, Earthman,” 
the answer came at last, “several 
small islands in the center of a great 
sea; all without life, save two. The 
men on one have learned to build 
boats which can successfully stiil the 
sea within certain limits — they can 
visit the other islands, but are too 
frail and too limited in power to 
venture past the horizon. It is in- 
finitely frustrating to them. The 
only places to which they may go 
are dead places. Save for one — 
only one, and it becomes magnified 
in importance — it becomes an en- 
tire raison d’etre in itself. For with- 
out it, the men with the boats sail 
uselessly . 

“We are old, Earthman. We have 
watched you — waited for you for a 
long time. And now you have 
grown up. You have burst your 
tiny bubble of human experience. 
You have set out upon the sea your- 
selves ...” 

“You guys should give gradua- 
tion talks. I didn’t ask for a scaled- 
down philosophy. You tell me that 
you want to give us every trick in 
your hat — ^for free, no questions 
asked. So I asked why. And the 
question isn’t changing any.” 

“The answer should be self-evi- 
dent, Earthman. We are old. And 
we are lonely.” 



T here was a logic at work 
somewhere in his brain even 
during the dream. It told him that 
he was exhausted from the day’s 
tour with the child-like men of 
Mars, and that the dream was only 
the vagaries of a reeling, tired 
mind of a badly jarred subcon- 

109 



/ 

scious. It/told him that the things 
lie had seen liad been too alien for 
his relatively inflexible adult Earth 
mind to aeecpt without painful 
reaction, and this was the reaction. 

This, till' dream. That was all it 
was; his logic said so. 

Earth spread out before the un- 
disciplined eye of his dreaming 
brain, and the near-conscious in- 
stant of logic faded. The fertile 
plains that once had been yellow 
desert-land mounted golden fruits 
to a temperate sun, and beyond the 
distant green of gently-rolling hills 
spread the resplendent city, and 
there were other cities as grace- 
fully civilized beyond the untrou- 
bled horizon. 

And in the dream, these were 
all things men had done, as though 
sanity had invaded their minds 
overnight. It was the Earth that 
men had intended, rather than that 
which they had built. 

The sun dimmed. The air 
chilled, and the grains and fruits 
wilted, and the rolling hills were a 
darker hue than green as the shad- 
ow lengthened, spread to the 
gleaming cities beyond and then as 
it touched them and ran soundless- 
ly the length and breadth of their 
wide malls, there were other 
changes . 

Skeletons, reaching upward to a 
puffy, leaden sky. 

The horizon split into jagged, 
broken moats of dark flame, and 
Earth was no longer what men had 
built, but what they eternally 
feared they must one day create . 

Then Johnny Love was suddenly 
awake bolt upright in his cot and 
his eyes were open wide. His mus- 
cles were taut and cramjied. And 
he was afraid although the men of 

.110 



Mars had offered friendship and 
told him that there was nothing 
for him to fear. 

Slowly, he lay down again. And 
gradually, the cold perspiration 
that had encased him vanished ; his 
body relaxed, and the fear sub- 
sided. 

The day’s tour had been exhaust- 
ing both mentally and physically, 
and there was the excitement of 
knowing that in five more days 
Harrison and Janes would land. If 
they did not, his own ship would 
carry him safely back to Earth on 
the day following, for the little men 
had miraculously repaired it; they 
had shown him. They had shown 
him, and he wanted to go home. 

Johnny Love rolled over on the 
wide, soft cot, sighed, and went 
back to sleep. 

"He sleeps again, Andruul.” 

"Yes, but the damage is prob- 
ably done." 

"No, or he would not sleep again 
so easily. His kind do not have such 
emotional control.” 

The two turned away from the 
fading transparency of the sleep- 
ing-room wall, and their short, thin 
bodies were in incongruous contrast 
to the spaciousness of the metal- 
sheathed corridor down which they 
walked. 

‘‘Psychoanalysis showed up the 
difference in his brain structure — 
that apparently accounts for the 
poor efficiency our screens are 
showing. IVhat docs Kaarn say?” 

"He says we should never have 
allowed the theft.” 

Andruul cursed. "Allowed it! 
Those nomadic scum are like flies! 
No matter how many you extermi- 
nate, they never fail to come back 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



in double their number. And they 
strike at the precise moment you 
are certain the bones of the last one 
are sinking beneath the sand. Some- 
how Central Patrol has got to get 
that unit back.” 

You’re certain it was a theft, 
then?” 

“Don’t be an idiot. Since when 
can those gypsies build anything 
more complex than a crude electri- 
cal generator? Let alone a psibeam 
unit? They’ve forgotten what little 
their civilization ever knew.” 

"They are clever enough at evad- 
ing directed over-surface missiles.” 

Andruul muttered something, 
and lapsed into silence. 

“Well there is one thing for cer- 
tain at any rate . A psibeam unit 
is unaccounted for, and despite our 
protective screening, the Earthman 
was visibly disturbed in his sleep. 
His encephalotapes show that clear- 
ly. They know about him, Andruul, 
and they’re making their bid. Cen- 
tral Patrol had belter be quick and 
certain this time.” 

Andruul kept his silence. But he 
thought. He thought Central Patrol 
was getting less efficient and more 
stupid every day. 

It was a strange feeling; a feel- 
ing with which no human was emo- 
tionally equipped to deal. 

Johnny looked at his flawlessly 
renovated ship, poised like a snub- 
nosed bullet against the blue-black 
brittleness of the Martian sky, and 
then looked behind him at the 
crescent-shaped formation of 
tracked vehicles that had escorted 
him back across the sucking red 
sand to this place. With each heavy- 
booted step away from them he 
closed the short distance between 

A GIFT FOR TERRA 



them and his ship, and there was 
not enough time to think about the 
feeling. Or about the heavy sealed 
tube they had given him to take 
back to his people. 

Usually, when a man ventured 
beyond the bounds of familiar ex- 
istence, there was conflict. Either a 
struggle to win, or, immediately 
recognizable success, with no strug- 
gle or hint of conflict at all. 

But not this. Not this success that 
seemed — what was the word? Hos- 
tile? That was ridiculous. These 
people were friendly. But somehow 
— there was an empty ring — 

Hell! They had saved his life. 
Rebuilt his ship. Given him the 
tube that contained transcriptions, 
in his own language, of every scien- 
tific secret his people could ever 
hope to learn for themselves in the 
next thousand years! And, they 
had even buried Ferris . 

Use the brains of a mature man, 
Johnny Love! You’ve pulled it off 
without even trying! The most stu- 
endous thing any man in any age 
as ever pulled off . without 
even trying! For God’s sake don’t 
question — don’t question things 
you don’t understand! Take the 
credit and let the soul-searching go! 

He looked behind him again. 
They were still there. A special, 
smiling farewell escort, watching a 
single, solitary figure cross a short 
expanse of sand to a towering, glis- 
tening thing of power. 

He raised a booted foot to the 
bottom fin-step, hauled himself up 
by the stern mounting rungs, ham- 
mered the outer lock stud with his 
gloved fist and the hatch swung 
open. Like a trap. 

He could feci the skin at the 
back of his neck tighten but he 

111 



forced himself to ignore it. The 
lock cycled up to thirteen psi and 
die inner port swung automatically 
Inward, and then he was inside, 
clambering up the narrow ladder 
past the titanium alloy fuel tanks 
and the spidery catwalks between 
them to the tiny control room in 
the fordiull. 

He would not be waiting for 
Harrison and Janes. He would get 
the hell out of here and then radio 
them and let them make all the de- 
cisions from there. Earth for him. 
Home. He ached for it. 

He strapped himself in the ham- 
mock, punched the warming studs 
for each engine, and there was a 
dull, muffled throb below him as 
each jumped into subdued life. The 
banks of dials that curved in front 
of him glowed softly, and he started 
an almost automatic blast-off check. 
It took twelve precious minutes. 

Then he was ready. Scanners on, 
heat up . ready. 

The Martian sky was like frozen 
ink above him and his hands w'ere 
wet inside his gloves and there was 
a choking dryness in his throat. 
Now . 

And he could not move. There 
was a sudden, awful nausea and his 
head spun, and before his eyes there 
spread a bleeding Earth; the sun 
dimmed, and fertile plains were 
cast in sudden shadow . The air 
chilled, the shadow spread, and 
there were skeletons reaching up- 
ward to a puffy, leaden sky! 

And Earth was no longer what 
Aten had built! 

Then the horror in his head was 
gone, and he felt an awful pressure 
on each side of it. His hands ... he 
had been pressing with insane 
strength at both sides of his skull 

112 



as if to crush it with his bare hands 
. His face was wet, and he was 
breathing, choking, in strangling 
gulps. 

A scanner alarm clanged. 

He forced his eyes to focus on 
the center screen. 

“Earthman! Emergency! There 
has been a flaw discovered in the 
repair of your ship! Do not blast 
off! Do not . .” 

The other image caught him as 
his arm was in mid-flight toward 
the control bank. Sweet and warm 
. the fertile plains mounting their 
golden fruits to a mellowed sun, 
and beyond the distant gently-roll- 
ing hills spread the resplendent 
city, and there were other cities . 

But his ann kept going, its mus- 
cles loose, and it fell. Heavily. 
Squarely on the stud-complex to- 
ward which its fist had been aimed 
a split-second before. 

The engines roared, and the ship 
lurched upward from the red sand. 

The command flicked into the 
Captain’s brain like a lash of ice. 

“Slaazar! Converge sheaf!” 

“Converging, sir . It would 
be no use, of course. If the high 
brass had been content to rely on 
the beams rather than on their own 
subtlety in the first place, the 
Earthman would never have fallen 
prey to the Nomads, even for a 
second. But they had wanted to be 
as forthright as possible — force, they 
said, would only arouse suspicion. 
Psibeam units only as a last resort 
... The lowliest Patrol Lancer 
could have told them the folly of 
that! 

Hastily, Slaazar issued orders to 
his battery crews tracking the 
ascending Spaceship, their units al- 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




ready nearing overload potential. 
But the desert-scum would see some 
real psi-power now! They’d see it 
wasted completely if they saw it at 
all .. Because they’d outma- 
neuvered the brass again! 

"Convergence impossible^ sir.” 
As he had expected. 

"Colonel Truul, this is Captain 
Slaazar. Target has passed critical 
planetary curvature. Convergence 
impossible. Standing by, sir.” 

For several moments after that, 
the thin atmosphere of Mars was 
warmed a little . ■, . 



CCELERATION blackout had 
not been total; leaving Mars 
was even easier than leaving the 
surface of Earth for the orbits of 
the Stations. But there was a period 
of no-thought, no-time, no-being. 
And then full consciousness seeped 
back slowly. But not as it was sup- 
posed to. 

Johnny Love knew he had come 
to because he could see the banked 
instruments glowing palely before 
him; because he could realize from 
reading them that his ship was do- 
ing its job to perfection. Almost 
ready to complete the blastoff ogee, 
and — 

Angrily he belted the scanner 
switches off and the dull red sphere 
faded from the viewplates. 

And he could feel the sweat start 
again all over his body. No, the re- 
turning consciousness was all 
wrong ... All wrong, and the 
image wouldn’t go away . 

Red desert he had seen before, 
yet had not seen. There were dark 
ridges of brown-green at its hori- 
zon; oddly-formed crater-places 
that might once have held placid 

A GIFT FOR TERRA 



lakes. And on all the vast surface 
there was no hint of the Patrol 
tracks, no sign of — anything. 

But he had to descend to the 
place. 

He did not know how to locate 
it, but the image told him that it 
did not matter. The image said 
merely that he must begin cutting 
his power. 

There was no strength in his arms 
and hands, yet they moved in front 
of him as though things detached 
from his body; .skillfully, surely, 
playing deftly across the colored 
studs. 

Scanners on. Scanners on, kid . 

He watched the screens again, 
unconscious of what his fingers did 
on the panels. The dull red sphere 
loomed large once more. The pic- 
ture was off-center; without know- 
ing W'hat he did he rectified course 
with the bow jets; it was centered 
again. But it was a different place. 
Still the desert, but with ridges of 
brown-green at its horizon; oddly- 
formed crater-places . 

It was coming up fast, now; 
faster, until the horizon was only 
a gentle arc against a thin span of 
blackness, and the rest was cold red. 

Hardly knowing what he did, his 
fingers suddenly raced over the 
control console, even before the 
scanner-alarms began their ear- 
splitting clanging! 

The ship lurched into a direc- 
tion-change that threatened to 
wrench the hull apart, and the pic- 
ture in the scanner reeled crazily. 
He knew his own brain was not dic- 
tating the commands of control to 
his fingertips, nor was it evaluating 
for itself the madly fluctuating 
values indicated on the panels. A 
human brain could not have done 




113 




it, he knew that . 

He had cut power. At least there 
was no power. He was falling at a 
crazy angle and the desert was rush- 
ing u[) now, hurtling up to smash 
him. They’d hit him, then, yet he’d 
felt nothing ... 

It was getting hot. His hull must 
be glowing, now, even in the thin 
atmosjjhere of Mars — it was a long 
fall. Slower than a fall on Earth, 
through thinner air layers, yet he 
was glowing like a torch. 

The ocean of sand rushed up. 

And suddenly his left hand 
rammed the full-power stud. 

It was as though he’d been hit 
from behind wdth all the brute 
force of some gigantic fist, and 
there were two things. There was 
the split-second glimpse of a cres- 
cent formation suddenly wheeling 
toward him and there was the clang 
of the scanner-alarm. There were 
those two things his brain registered 
before the titanic force of full pow- 
er squeezed consciousness from it 
and left him helpless. 

He was running. In a nightmare 
of a dead planet that was not dead, 
he ran, away from something. 

That was how his consciousness 
returned. While he ran. He 
stopped, stumbling, turned to look 
behind him. 

And the ship was there. Landed 
perfectly, stubby bullet-nose point- 
ing to the sky. And above it — 

Run! 

The command hit his brain with 
almost physical force. A will that 
was not his own took hold of his 
whole being, and he was rimning 
again, plowing his way through the 
sucking sand with strength sum- 
moned from a well of energy with- 

114 



in his body that had never been 
there before. 

Through the thin glassite walls 
of his helmet he could hear the 
thuk, thuk, thuk of his boots as 
they pounded somewhere below 
him, and there was another 
pounding, a deadly rhythmic burst- 
ing pressure in his chest. And a 
whine in his ears . 

The wind-strewn sand stretched 
flat and infinitely before him. Then 
leaped at him headlong and there 
was no horizon; there was only the 
sudden awful wrench of concus- 
sion, a tremor of pure sound which 
would, in denser atmosphere, have 
destroyed him with the inertia of 
his own body. 

He could not move. Only cling 
to the shifting desert floor that 
rocked sickeningly beneath his out- 
stretched body . cling to it for 
dear life. 

There was no thought, no under- 
standing. Only a sensation which 
he could not comprehend, and the 
sure knowledge that none of this 
was real. Not real, but the end of 
survival nonetheless. 



P AIN, and seeing two bright ob- 
jects transiting the darkness at 
which he looked; seeing something 
then between. 

His brain began identifying. The 
darkness; sky. The bright objects; 
Diemos, Phobos . And the some- 
thing between — 

It was a transparency of some 
sort; curved, or he would not have 
been able to detect it at all. A 
vaulted ceiling through which he 
could see . 

His full consciousness came 
flooding back, then. He tried the 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



muscles in his neck, they hurt, but 
they worked, and he could move 
his head from side to side. There 
was the same transparency, as 
though he were covered by some 
huge, invisible bowl. 

And there were men. Big, mus- 
cular creatures, yet thin, tall . 
Not like the others at all . 

He sat bolt upright, and they 
did not move. It was not the same 
as before. No small room. No voice 
that he could not see. They had 
not even removed his suit or his 
helmet, and he was lying on a 
hard, cold substance. 

Then he saw what they were 
doing. There were two of them 
apart from the others, working to 
bring a compact-looking machine 
into position near him. A gleaming, 
short cylinder, swung on gymbals 
between slender forks, mounted on 
a thin wheeled standard. They 



were aiming it at him. 

“No! No—’ He tried to get to 
his knees, but it was as though 
there were no muscles in his body. 

“Man of — Earth! We arc friend- 
ly. Is that understood?” 

The thought-words formed in 
his brain as the strange images had 
before, and then he knew. Should 
have guessed it, part of his mind 
was telling him in a fantastically 
detached way, the dreams . the 
compulsions over which he had 
had no control in the ship . 
This — thing. It probably — 

“You are quite astute. Earth- 
man. But it is not our technology 
which created this device. To save 
you and the civilization which you 
represent — and ultimately, our own 
— it was necessary for us to steal it. 
It cost six lives.” 

“Steal. .” 

“From your former captors. It is

their invention, as are so many 
things with which they destroy. 
With this instrument, they have 
succeeded in taking one of Nature’s 
more subtle phenomenon — psy- 
chokinesis — and amplifying its 
energies nearly a million-fold. 
Those stepp>ed-up energies can then 
be projected in a tight or fanned 
beam at will. 

“They can make a man ‘dream,’ 
as you did — or they can destroy 
him outright, depending on which 
of the *psi’ factors, ESP or PK, is 
given dominance during projec- 
tion. But we are not skilled in its 
operation — they detected our use 
of it on you while you slept, and 
from that moment on you were so 
well screened that even at the risk 
of burning this unit out, wc were 
not able to project powerfully 
enough to do more than merely 
touch your brain — ” 

T here was a strange calm in 
his mind, now. He undestood 
the words and accepted them as 
matter-of-factly as they were given. 
Even now they were manipulating 
him like some intangible puppet, 
yet he was convinced it was not a 
malevolent manipulation. Con- 
vinced. The conviction — manipu- 
lation, too. 

“Only partly, Earthman. We 
said we are friendly, and we are. 
We have calmed you and erased 
your fear. From this point on, we 
will use this instrument only for 
communication. 

And then he felt the fear in him 
again, gnawing, and his body was 
again damp and cold. But he had 
control, now. Control enough to 

116 



speak. 

They stood before him, im- 
mobile, watching. 

Somewhere, Johnny Love found 
his voice. 

“Look, I’ve been through this 
‘friendly’ act before . .’’ He hesi- 
tated, and they did not try to in- 
terrupt him. “Well don’t just stand 
there!’’ The fear was suddenly 
turning to the bitter anger of frus- 
tration, they had him whipped, and 
he was tired. “Tell me why! You 
stick that thing into my head when 
I’m blasting for home. You force 
me to drop back. You blow up my 
ship. Real friendly! Real sports!’’ 
For a moment he had run out of 
words, and again they made no 
effort to an.swer him. “All right! I 
don’t understand you — I don’t 
know what you want. But nobody 
is trying to hurt you, nobody’s aft- 
er your little desert paradise. We 
had an idea, that’s all. Wc thought 
we could make it work. People 
have been talking ‘go to Mars’ on 
my planet for longer than most of 
’em can remember. So we finally 
gave it a whirl! Sorry!” 

He looked at them hard, then, 
and thought that there was some- 
thing almost like a smile on the 
face of one. Smile, then, damn 
you. 

“We want nothing, Earthman, 
but to prevent from happening on 
your planet the thing that hap- 
pened on this. If they succeed in 
destroying you as they have us, 
then this System will always be un- 
der their heel, and we shall never 
be rid of them. Understand, their 
numbers were too few ever to con- 
quer a planet with a civilization 
as large and as highly organized 
as that of Earth, by physical means. 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



“Knowing that, we — they call us 
gypsies, nomads, desert-scum to- 
day — we were not too alarmed 
when they landed here two cen- 
turies ago. We were glad to take 
from them, without paying a price. 
We were awed by their gifts. Their 
papers and their books, which 
would show us how to rebuild our 
waning civilization — advance us a 
thousand years in less than fifty; 
restore to us our lost arts . And 
compared to you, we were so very 
few. 

“In return, they said that all 
they wanted was permission to set 
up a research site. They told us 
they were a scientific expedition 
from far out-System. Aldeberan, 
they said. Part of a vast exploratory 
program which they had been con- 
ducting for centuries. 

“We believed them — why not? 



One day, we thou^t, we too will 
be in Spaced And with that day 
would begin one of the greatest 
projects of exploration that our 
race had ever known. So we 
agreed, and gladly.” 

“Hold it, hold it! ‘They’ — who 
the hell are ‘they’? You can spare 
the suspense . 

And then there was no more 
words. The pictures formed in his 
mind as before, only stronger, now, 
and there were no details left out. 

The weapons of war had been 
built, not by the out-System men, 
but by their hosts. The plans had 
not proven too difficult to follow . 

The new knowledge was not 
hoarded, was not held under jeal- 
ous guard by those who had given 
it, but by those to whom it had 
been given. One man from anoth- 
er; one group of men from another.

States and nations from each other. 

Until there was no trust left on 
all the planet. 

There were the wars, then. 

And when they were over, the 
new masters had established their 
first beaelihead in the new System. 

“But, it was only a beachhead, 
and had been only intended as 
such — ” The pictures broke off ; the 
unspoken words resumed. “Your 
planet was the ultimate target, but 
at first, your civilization was not 
adequately advanced to fall prey 
to their technique. Their weapon 
is knowledge, but the potentialities 
of that knowledge must be under- 
stood by a people before it can 
be effectively used to destroy them. 

“The rest must be self-evident. 
After we destroyed ourselves, they 
sank their infectious, hollow roots 
into our planet. And from then, in- 
vestigated your Earth from time to 
time . and waited . 

“Waited, because they knew you 
would be coming. And they knew 
what kind of men you would be. 
Strong men, with the light of the 
stars in your eyes. Yet confused, 
weak men, with the darkness of 
suspicion and jealousy still in your 
souls. Such arc humans, after all. 

“That is why we stopped you, 
Johnny Love. Once your blast-off 
ogee had carried you beyond the 
curvature of their horizon and 
brought you over us, our psibeam 
was effective and theirs were not. 
We are sorry about your ship. Once 
they realize that you were under 
our influence, and were returning 
rather than taking their precious 
data to your people, they zeroed- 
in with those damnable guided jug- 
gernauts — ” 

“It wasn’t you, then. You mean 

118 



they — ” 

“There is little that they can- 
not do. Destruction is their forte. 
They could not keep us from pre- 
venting your taking their ‘gift’ to 
your people, but they could keep 
that ‘gift’ from falling into our 
hands — and they did. They do not 
always win. But they never lose.” 

“But I — ” Johnny’s thoughts 
raced. The ship, gone. And Har- 
rison and Janes, Lamson, and 
Fowler. They would be landing in 
a few days. They — 

“Yes,” the thoughts of the true 
Martians before him answered. 
“And they will be given a ‘gift’ for 
Terra as you were. If your friends 
return successfully to your planet 
with that ‘gift’ — then — ” 

The thought was not completed. 
But it did not have to be. 

A beachhead was one thing. 
These scattered, struggling people 
who had once been masters of 
Mars might one day unseat it, for 
they were not yet beaten people, 
and their will to survive was yet 
strong. But beyond that' — 

Earth taken, the System taken. 

There it was. 

There was a sudden coldness in- 
side him now that the fact had 
crystallized, had become real. Here 
was no fantasy; no wild surmise. 

They left him in silence while 
he thought, their psibeam turned 
away, now. 

Harrison and Janes. Lamson, 
and Fowler. Had to stop them. 
Stop them, and then somehow, get 
home. He ached for home. 

He thought about Ferris, who 
had given his life for this thing. 

No, Feiris would not be going 
home. Ferris was dead. 

He signalled for the psibeam to 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



be turned toward him again. 

“You’d have to know their posi- 
tions out there to make contact, 
wouldn’t you?” They did not an- 
swer. He worked to get the words 
formed, and there was a fleeting 
thought of a green, lush planet far 
away, its wide streets and rolling 
fields bathed in warm sunlight. “I 
can figure ’em,” he said. “I know 
blast-off schedules, speeds. I know 
the works! Those things they had 
in the books. Then you guys can do 
the rest with — that thing. Right?” 

They answered him, then. 

“Thank you,” they said. And 
that was all. 

“Answer me!” the General 
barked again. “You, Janes! Lam- 
son! Fowler — Harrison! For the 
last time, what happened out 
there?” 

The four stood silently before 
the nervous figure of their com- 
mander, and it was Fowler who 



finally spoke. 

“Plan III, sir, as we’ve already 
said. Condition Untenable — Re- 
turn . .” 

“That is all you can say?” 

“That i.s— all, sir.” 

The General turned away. 
There was frustration and anger in 
his face, and it hid the fear be- 
neath it like a mask. Plan III. It 
would be Plan III for a long 
time yet. 

It was the thing he saw in the 
faces of the four men that told 
him that. There had been too 
many giant steps, too fast. He had 
seen this thing in the faces of men 
before, but never so nakedly. 

One day, perhaps, men could 
think of Plan I again. One day, 
but not now. 

He turned back to the four, and 
looked once more into their faces. 

Plan HI. Condition Untenable. 

“Dismissed!” the General said. 



WASTE NOT, WANT (Continued from page 77) 



call to treat me like a criminal. 
Nor to talk to me as if I were 
senile. My outlook won’t change, 
and you know it!” 

“Oh, yes, it will! And since 
you’re neither criminal nor senile, 
that’.s what has to be done. 

“We’ll do it in the most humane 
way possible. A little brain sur- 



gery, and you’ll sit in your cage 
and consume and consume and 
consume without a care in the 
world. Yes, sir, we’ll change your 
outlook ! 

“Now, you mustn’t try to twist 
away from me like that, Mr. Lub- 
way. I can’t let you go. We need 
every consumer we can get.” • • •
