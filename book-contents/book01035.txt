HOW NOW, GRAY CELL? 



S OME time back, I wrote an 
editorial protesting the identi- 
fying of extra-sensory research 
with Dr. Rhine of Duke Univer- 
sity, quarreled with his methods 
and declared that we should look 
elsewhere for developments. 

Then I stuck my fingers in my 
ears. I needn’t have braced my- 
self — only a very few of those 
who wrote in objected and a good 
many were glad to learn they 
weren’t alone in questioning 
Rhine’s approach and findings. 
The editorial even induced some 
people to attempt their own re- 
search. 

This is the part that has me 
puzzled and hesitant — puzzled 
because I haven’t an idea of 
where to begin, hesitant because 
my own experiences with psi 
should be shared and yet I na- 
turally am not a bit eager to be 
considered a crank, cultist or 
crackpot. 

Well, look, before I talk my- 
self out of it, let’s get the inci- 
dents down fast. 

During the war, when the news 
of the Battle of the Bulge came 
crashing in, the C. O. of my outfit 
gave us a this-is-it pep talk; all 
the might of the German army 
was massed against us, we were in 



danger of being driven into the 
sea, the war would go on inde- 
finitely now, and so forth. 

As orientation man, I had war 
maps by the dozen and was as- 
tonished that nobody was men- 
tioning the huge fight between the 
Nazis and the Russians in, I 
think, Romania, at least twice 
as big if no more bitter than the 
Bulge. Letting people know about 
it would have reduced anxiety. 

When I gave my orientation 
lecture, which was shortly after 
the C. O. had alarmed us, I said 
this was obviously a final des- 
perate gamble and the end had 
to be near. “Oh, yeah?” chal- 
lenged the first sergeant. “If you 
know so much, when’ll the war 
be over?” 

That was in December. What 
happened to me should interest 
researchers, for I felt an electric- 
chair shock, my muscles constrict- 
ed, my eyes hurt furiously and 
my head built up a sudden shat- 
tering internal pressure, and I 
was overwhelmed by apprehen- 
sion as the answer came out: 
“April 30th.” 

The first sergeant got me to 
bet $2.50. The actual date was 
May 8th and he collected, but

there were pressing things to

name. He said you’d want to see 
him. He will be back by eight.” 
Baron drummed his fingers on 
the table top, staring about the 
quiet lounge. Street trade was 
discouraged at the Red Lion, 



gently but persuasively; the pa- 
trons were few in number. Across 
to the right was a group that 
Baron knew vaguely — Andean 
climbers, or at least two of them 
were. Over near the door he

recognized old Balmer, who had 
mapped the first passage to the 
core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. 
Baron returned his smile with a 
nod. Then he settled back and 
waited impatiently for the in- 
truder who demanded his time 
without justifying it. 

Presently a small, grizzled man 
crossed the room and sat down at 
Baron’s table. He was short and 
wiry. His face held no key to his 
age — he might have been thirty 
or a thousand — but he looked 
weary and immensely ugly. His 
cheeks and forehead were twisted 
and brown, with scars that were 
still healing. 

The stranger said, “I’m glad 
you waited. I’ve heard you’re 
planning to attempt the Bright- 
side.” 

Baron stared at the man for a 
moment. “I see you can read tele- 
casts,” he said coldly. “The news 
was correct. We are going to 
make a Brightside Crossing.” 

“At perihelion?” 

“Of course. When else?” 

r ]' , HE grizzled man searched 
-*• Baron’s face for a 'moment 
without expression. Then he said 
slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re not 
going to make the Crossing.” 

“Say, who are you, if you don’t 
mind?” Baron demanded. 

“The name is Claney,” said the 
stranger. 

There was a silence. Then: 



“Claney? Peter Claney?” 

“That’s right.” 

Baron’s eyes were wide with 
excitement, all trace of anger 
gone. “My God, man — where 
have you been hiding? We’ve 
been trying to contact you for 
months!” 

“I know. I was hoping you’d 
quit looking and chuck the whole 
idea.” 

“Quit looking!” Baron bent for- 
ward over the table. “My friend, 
we’d given up hope, but we’ve 
never quit looking. Here, have a 
drink. There’s so much you can 
tell us.” His fingers were trem- 
bling. 

Peter Claney shook his head. 
“I can’t tell you anything you 
want to hear.” 

“But you’ve got to. You’re the 
only man on Earth who’s at- 
tempted a Brightside Crossing 
and liv^d through it! And the 
story you cleared for the news — 
it was nothing. We need details. 
Where did your equipment fall 
down? Where did you miscalcu- 
late? What were the trouble 
spots?” Baron jabbed a finger at 
Claney’s face. “That, for instance 
— epithelioma? Why? What was 
wrong with your glass? Your fil- 
ters? We’ve got to know those 
things. If you can tell us, we can 
make it across where your at- 
tempt failed — ” 

“You want to know why we 
failed?” asked Claney.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Of course we want to know. 
We have to know.” 

“It’s simple. We failed because 
it can’t be done. We couldn’t do 
it and neither can you. No human 
beings will ever cross the Bright- 
side alive, not if they try for 
centuries.” 

“Nonsense,” Baron declared. 
“We will.” 

Claney shrugged. “I was there. 
I know what I’m saying. You 
can blame the equipment or the 
men — there were flaws in both 
quarters — but we just didn’t 
know what we were fighting. It 
was the planet that whipped us, 
that and the Sun. They’ll whip 
you, too, if you try it.” 

“Never,” said Baron. 

“Let me tell you,” Peter Claney 
said. 

1 ’D BEEN interested in the 

Brightside for almost as long 
as I can remember (Claney said). 
I guess I was about ten when 
Wyatt and Carpenter made the 
last attempt — that was in 2082, 
I think. I followed the news 
stories like a tri-V serial and then 
I was heartbroken when they just 
disappeared. 

I know now that they were a 
pair of idiots, starting off without 
proper equipment, with practic- 
ally no knowledge of surface 
conditions, without any charts 
— they couldn’t have made a 
hundred miles, snowflakes in hell 



— but I didn’t know that then and 
it was a terrible tragedy. After 
that, I followed Sanderson’s work 
in the Twilight Lab up there and 
began to get Brightside into my 
blood, sure as death. 

But it was Mikuta’s idea to 
attempt a Crossing. Did you ever 
know Tom Mikuta? I don’t sup- 
pose you did. No, not Japanese 
— Polish-American. He was a 
major in the Interplanetary Ser- 
vice for some years and hung 
onto the title after he gave up 
his commission. 

He was with Armstrong on 
Mars during his Service days, 
with a good deal of the original 
mapping and surveying for the 
Colony to his credit. I first met 
him on Venus; we spent five years 
together up there doing some of 
the nastiest exploring since the 
Matto Grasso. Then he made the 
attempt on Vulcan Crater that 
paved the way for Balmer a few 
years later. 

I’d always liked the Major — 
he was big and quiet and cool, 
the sort of guy who always had 
things figured a little further 
ahead than anyone else and al- 
ways knew what to do in a tight 
place. Too many men in this 
game are all nerve and luck, with 
no judgment. The Major had 
both. He also had the kind of per- 
sonality that could take a crew 
of wild men and make them work 
like a well-oiled machine across 



BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING

a thousand miles of Venus jungle. 
I liked him and I trusted him. 

He contacted me in New York 
and he was very casual at first. 
We spent an evening here at the 
Red Lion, talking about old 
times; he told me about the Vul- 
can business, and how he’d been 
out to see Sanderson and the 
Twilight Lab on Mercury, and 
how he preferred a hot trek to 
a cold one any day of the year 
— and then he wanted to know 
what I’d been doing since Venus 
and what my plans were. 

“No particular plans,” I told 
him. “Why?” 

H E LOOKED me over. “How 
much do you weigh, Peter?” 
I told him one-thirty-five. 
“That much!” he said. “Be 
damned. Well, there can’t be 
much fat on you, at any rate. 
How do you take heat?” 

“You should know,” I said. 
“Venus was no icebox.” 

“No, I mean real heat.” 

Then I began to get it. “You’re 
planning a trip.” 

“That’s right. A hot trip.” He 
grinned at me. “Might be danger- 
ous, too.” 

“What trip?” 

“Brightside of Mercury,” the 
Major said. 

I whistled cautiously. “Aphe- 
lion?” 

He threw his head back. “Why 
try a Crossing at Aphelion? What 



have you done then? Four thou- 
sand miles of butcherous heat, 
just to have some joker come 
along, use your data and drum 
you out of the glory by crossing 
at perihelion forty-four days 
later? No, thanks. I want the 
Brightside without any nonsense 
about it.” He leaned across me 
eagerly. “I want to make a Cross- 
ing at perihelion and I want to 
cross on the surface. If a man can 
do that, he’s got Mercury. Until 
then, nobody’s got Mercury. I 
want Mercury — but I’ll need 
help getting it.” 

I’d thought of it a thousand 
times and never dared consider 
it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and 
Carpenter disappeared. Mercury 
turns on its axis in the same time 
that it wheels around the Sun, 
which means that the Brightside 
is always facing in. That makes 
the Brightside of Mercury at peri- 
helion the hottest place in the 
Solar System, with one single 
exception: the surface* of the Sun 
itself. 

It would be a hellish trek. Only 
a few men had ever learned just 
how hellish and they never came 
back to tell about it. It was a real 
hell’s Crossing, but someday 
somebody would cross it. 

I wanted to be along. 

'pHE TWILIGHT LAB, near 
the northern pole of Mer- 
cury, was the obvious jumping- 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



off place. The setup there wasn’t 
very extensive — a rocket land- 
ing, the labs and quarters for 
Sanderson’s crew sunk deep into 
the crust, and the tower that 
housed the Solar ’scope that 
Sanderson had built up there ten 
years before. 

Twijight Lab wasn’t particu- 
larly interested in the Brightside, 
of course — the Sun was Sander- 
son’s baby and he’d picked Mer- 
cury as the closest chunk of rock 
to the Sun that could hold his 
observatory. He’d chosen a good 
location, too. On Mercury, the 
Brightside temperature hits 770° 
F. at perihelion and the Darkside 
runs pretty constant at -410° F. 
No permanent installation with 
a human crew could survive at 
either extreme. But with Mer- 
cury’s wobble, the twilight zone 
I between Brightside and Darkside 
offers something closer to survi- 
val temperatures. 

Sanderson built the Lab up 
near the pole, where the zone is 
about 5 miles wide, so the tem- 
perature only varies 50 to 60 
degrees with the libration. The 
Solar ’scope could take that much 
change and they’d get good clear 
observation of the Sun for about 
70 out of the 88 days it takes 
the planet to wheel around. 

The Major was counting on 
Sanderson knowing something 
about Mercury as well as the Sur 
when we camped at the Lab to 



make final preparations. 

Sanderson did. He thought 
we’d lost our minds and he said 
so, but he gave us all the help 
he could. He spent a week brief- 
ing Jack Stone, the third member 
of our party, who had arrived 
with the supplies and equipment 
a few days earlier. Poor Jack met 
us at the rocket landing almost 
bawling, Sanderson had given 
him such a gloomy picture of 
what Brightside was like. 

Stone was a youngster — hard- 
ly 25, I’d say — but he’d been 
with the Major at Vulcan and 
had begged to join this trek. I 
had a funny feeling that Jack 
really didn’t care for exploring 
too much, but he thought Mikuta 
was God, followed him around 
like a puppy. 

It didn’t matter to me as long 
as he knew what he was getting 
in for. You don’t go asking peo- 
ple in this game why they do it 
— they’re liable to get awfully 
uneasy and none of them can 
ever give you an answer that 
makes sense. Anyway, Stone had 
borrowed three men from the 
Lab, and had the supplies and 
equipment all lined up when we 
got there, ready to check and test. 

W E DUG RIGHT in. With 
plenty of funds — tri-V 
money and some government cash 
the Major had talked his way 
around — our equipment was 



BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING 



11 



new and good. Mikuta had done 
the designing and testing himself, 
with a big assist from Sanderson. 
We had four Bugs, three of them 
the light pillow-tire models, with 
special lead-cooled cut-in engines 
when the heat set in, and one 
heavy-duty tractor model for pull- 
ing the sledges. 

The Major went over them 
like a kid at the circus. Then he 
said, “Have you heard anything 
from Mclvers?” 

“Who’s he?” Stone wanted to 
know. 

“He’ll be joining us. He’s a 
good man — got quite a name 
for climbing, back home.” The 
Major turned to me. “You’ve 
probably heard of him.” 

I’d heard plenty of stories 
about Ted Mclvers and I wasn’t 
too happy to hear that he was 
joining us. “Kind of a daredevil, 
isn’t he?” 

“Maybe. He’s lucky and skill- 
ful. Where do you draw the line? 
We’ll need plenty of both.” 

“Have you ever worked with 
him?” I asked. 

“No. Are you worried?” 

“Not exactly. But Brightside 
is no place to count on luck.” 
The Major laughed. “I don’t 
think we need to worry about 
Mclvers. We understood each 
other when I talked up the trip to 
him and we’re going to need 
each other too much to do any 
fooling around.” He turned back 

12 



to the supply list. “Meanwhile, 
let’s get this stuff listed and 
packed. We’ll need to cut weight 
sharply and our time is short. 
Sanderson says we should leave 
in three days.” 

Two days later, Mclvers hadn’t 
arrived. The Major didn’t say 
much about it: Stone was getting 
edgy and so was I. We spent the 
second day studying charts of 
the Brightside, such as they were. 
The best available were pretty 
poor, taken from so far out that 
the detail dissolved into blurs on 
blow-up. They showed the big- 
gest ranges of peaks and craters 
and faults, and that was all. Still, 
we could use them to plan a 
broad outline of our course. 

“This range here,” the Major 
said as we crowded around the 
board, “is largely inactive, ac- 
cording to Sanderson. But these 
to the south and west could be 
active. Seismograph tracings sug- 
gest a lot of activity in that re- 
gion, getting worse down toward 
the equator — not only volcanic, 
but sub-surface shifting.” 

CTONE NODDED. “Sanderson 
^ told me there was probably 
constant surface activity.” 

The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s 
treacherous, there’s no doubt of 
it. But the only way to avoid it 
is to travel over the Pole, which 
would lose us days and offer us 
no guarantee of less activity to 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the west. Now we might avoid 
some if we could find a pass 
through this range and cut sharp 
east — ” 

It seemed that the more we 
considered the problem, the fur- 
ther we got from a solution. We 
knew there were active volcanoes 
on the Brightside — even on the 
Darkside, though surface activity 
there was pretty much slowed 
down and localized. 

But there were problems of 
atmosphere on Brightside, as 
well. There was an atmosphere 
and a constant atmospheric flow 
from Brightside to Darkside. Not 
much — the lighter gases had 
reached escape velocity and dis- 
appeared from Brightside mil- 
lenia ago — but there was C0 2 , 
and nitrogen, and traces of other 
heavier gases. There was also an 
abundance of sulfur vapor, as 
well as carbon disulfide and sul- 
fur dioxide. 

The atmospheric tide moved 
toward the Darkside, where it 
condensed, carrying enough vol- 
canic ash with it for Sanderson 
to estimate the depth and nature 
of the surface upheavals on 
Brightside from his samplings. 
The trick was to find a passage 
that avoided those upheavals as 
far as possible. But in the final 
analysis, we were barely scrap- 
ing the surface. The only way we 
would find out what was happen- 
ing where was to be there. 



Finally, on the third day, Mc- 
Ivers blew in on a freight rocket 
from Venus. He’d missed the ship 
that the Major and I had taken 
by a few hours, and had conned 
his way to Venus in hopes of 
getting a hop from there. He 
didn’t seem too upset about it, 
as though this were his usual way 
of doing things and he couldn’t 
see why everyone should get so 
excited. 

He was a tall, rangy man with 
long, wavy hair prematurely gray, 
and the sort of eyes that looked 
like a climber’s — half-closed, 
sleepy, almost indolent, but cap- 
able of abrupt alertness. And he 
never stood still; he was always 
moving, always doing something 
with his hands, or talking, or pac- 
ing about. 

Evidently the Major decided 
not to press the issue of his ar- 
rival. There was still work to do, 
and an hour later we were run- 
ning the final tests on the pres- 
sure suits. That evening, Stone 
and Mclvers were thick as 
thieves, and everything was set 
for an early departure after we 
got some rest. 

«4ND THAT,” said Baron, 
finishing his drink and sig- 
naling the waiter for another pair, 
“was your first big mistake.” 
Peter Claney raised his eye- 
brows. “Mclvers?” 

“Of course.” 



BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING

Claney shrugged, glanced at 
the small quiet tables around 
them. “There are lots of bizarre 
personalities around a place like 
this, and some of the best 
wouldn’t seem to be the most 
reliable at first glance. Anyway, 
personality problems weren’t our 
big problem right then. Equip- 
ment worried us first and route 
next.” 

Baron nodded in agreement. 
“What kind of suits did you 
have?” 

“The best insulating suits ever 
made,” said Claney. “Each one 
had an inner lining of a fiber- 
glass modification, to avoid the 
clumsiness of asbestos, and car- 
ried the refrigerating unit and 
oxygen storage which we re- 
charged from the sledges every 
eight hours. Outer layer carried 
a monomolecular chrome reflect- 
ing surface that made us glitter 
like Christmas trees. And we had 
a half-inch dead-air space under 
positive pressure between the 
two layers. Warning thermo- 
couples, of course — at 770 de- 
grees, it wouldn’t take much time 
to fry us to cinders if the suits 
failed somewhere.” 

“How about the Bugs?” 

“They were insulated, too, but 
we weren’t counting on them too 
much for protection.” 

“You weren’t!” Baron ex- 
claimed. “Why not?” 

“We’d be in and out of them

too much. They gave us mobility 
and storage, but we knew we’d 
have to do a lot of forward work 
on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. 
“Which meant that we had an 
inch of fiberglass and a half-inch 
of dead air between us and a 
surface temperature where lead 
flowed like water and zinc was 
almost at melting point and the 
pools of sulfur in the shadows 
were boiling like oatmeal over 
a campfire.” 

Baron licked his lips. His fin- 
gers stroked the cool, wet glass 
as he set it down on the table- 
cloth. 

“Go on,” he said tautly. “You 
started on schedule?” 

“Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we 
started on schedule, all right. We 
just didn’t quite end on schedule, 
and that was all. But I’m getting 
to that.” 

He settled back in his chair 
and continued. 

W E JUMPED off from Twi- 
light on a course due south- 
east with thirty days to make it 
to the Center of Brightside. If we 
could cross an average of 70 
miles a day, we could hit Center 
exactly at perihelion, the point 
of Mercury’s closest approach to 
the Sun — which made Center 
the hottest part of the planet at 
the hottest it ever gets. 

The Sun was already huge and 
yellow over the horizon when we 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



started, twice the size it appears 
on Earth. Every day that Sun 
would grow bigger and whiter, 
and every day the surface would 
get hotter. But once we reached 
Center, the job was only half 
done — we would still have to 
travel another 2000 miles to the 
opposite twilight zone. Sanderson 
was to meet us on the other side 
in the Laboratory’s scout ship, 
approximately 60 days from the 
time we jumped off. 

That was the plan, in outline. 
It was up to us to cross those 
seventy miles a day, no matter 
how hot it became, no matter 
what terrain we had to cross. De- 
tours would be dangerous and 
time-consuming. Delays could 
** cost us our lives. We all knew 
that. 

The Major briefed us on de- 
tails an hour before we left. 
“Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, 
the small one we stripped down 
for you. Stone and I will flank 
you on either side, giving you a 
hundred-yard lead. Mclvers, 
you’ll have the job of dragging 
the pledges, so we’ll have to direct 
your course pretty closely. Peter’s 
job is to pick the passage at any 
given point. If there’s any doubt 
of safe passage, we’ll all explore 
ahead on foot before we risk the 
Bugs. Got that?” 

Mclvers and Stone exchanged 
glances. Mclvers said: “Jack and 
I were planning to change around. 



We figured he could take the 
sledges. That would give me a 
little more mobility.” 

T HE Major looked up sharply 
at Stone. “Do you buy that, 
Jack?” 

Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. 
Mac wanted — ” 

Mclvers made an impatient 
gesture with his hands. “It doesn’t 
matter. I just feel better when 
I’m on the move. Does it make 
any difference?” 

“I guess it doesn’t,” said the 
Major. “Then you’ll flank Peter 
along with me. Right?” 

“Sure, sure.” Mclvers pulled at 
his lower lip. “Who’s going to do 
the advance scouting?” 

“It sounds like I am,” I cut in. 
“We want to keep the lead Bug 
light as possible.” 

Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. 
Peter’s Bug is stripped down to 
the frame and wheels.” 

Mclvers shook his head. “No, 
I mean the advance work. You 
need somebody out ahead — four 
or five miles, at least — to pick 
up the big flaws and active sur- 
face changes, don’t you?” He 
stared at the Major. “I mean, how 
can we tell what sort of a hole 
we may be moving into, unless 
we have a scout up ahead?” 
“That’s what we have the 
charts for,” the Major said sharp- 
ly- 

“Charts! I’m talking about de- 



BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING 



15 




tail work. We don’t need to worry 
about the major topography. It’s 
the little faults you can’t see on 
the pictures that can kill us.” He 
tossed the charts down excitedly. 
“Look, let me take a Bug out 
ahead and work reconnaissance, 
keep five, maybe ten miles ahead 
of the column. I can stay on good 
solid ground, of course, but scan 
the area closely and radio back 
to Peter where to avoid the flaws. 
Then — ” 

“No dice,” the Major broke in. 

“But why not? We could save 
ourselves days!” 

“I don’t care what we could 
save. We stay together. When we 
get to the Center, I want live 
men along with me. That means 

16 



we stay within easy sight of each 
other at all times. Any climber 
knows that everybody is safer in 
a party than one man alone — 
anytime, anyplace.” 

Mclvers stared at him, his 
cheeks an angry red. Finally he 
gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you 
say so.” 

“Well, I say so and I mean it. 
I don’t want any fancy stuff. 
We’re going to hit Center to- 
gether, and finish the Crossing 
together. Got that?” 

Mclvers nodded. Mikuta then 
looked at Stone and me and we 
nodded, too. 

“All right,” he said slowly. 
“Now that we’ve got it straight, 
let’s go.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




I T WAS HOT. If I forget every- 
thing else about that trek, I’ll 
never forget that huge yellow 
Sun glaring down, without a 
break, hotter and hotter with 
every mile. We knew that the 
first few days would be the easiest 
and we were rested and fresh 
when we started down the long 
ragged gorge southeast of the 
Twilight Lab. 

I moved out first; back over 
my shoulder, I could see the 
Major and Mclvers crawling out 
behind me, their pillow tires tak- 
ing the rugged floor of the gorge 
smoothly. Behind them, Stone 
dragged the sledges. 

Even at only 30 per cent Earth 
gravity they were a strain on the 



big tractor, until the ski-blades 
bit into the fluffy volcanic ash 
blanketing the valley. We even 
had a path to follow for the first 
20 miles. 

I kept my eyes pasted to the 
big polaroid binocs, picking out 
the track the early research 
teams had made out into the 
edge of Brightside. But in a 
couple of hours we rumbled past 
Sanderson’s little outpost ob- 
servatory and the tracks stopped. 
We were in virgin territory and 
already the Sun was beginning 
to bite. 

We didn’t feel the heat so much 
those first days out. We saw it. 
The refrig units kept our skins 
at a nice comfortable 75° F. in- 



BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING 



17 



side our suits, but our eyes 
watched that glaring Sun and the 
baked yellow rocks going past, 
and some nerve pathways got 
twisted up, somehow. We poured 
sweat as if we were in a super- 
heated furnace. 

We drove eight hours and 
slept five. When a sleep period 
came due, we pulled the Bugs 
together into a square, threw up 
a light aluminum sun-shield and 
lay out in the dust and rocks. 
The sun-shield cut the tempera- 
ture down 60 or 70 degrees, for 
whatever help that was. And 
then we ate from the forward 
sledge — sucking through tubes 
— protein, carbohydrates, bulk 
gelatin, vitamins. 

The Major measured water 
out with an iron hand, because 
we’d have drunk ourselves into 
nephritis in a week otherwise. We 
were constantly, unceasingly 
thirsty. Ask the physiologists and 
psychiatrists why — they can 
give you half a dozen interesting 
reasons — but all we knew, or 
cared about, was that it happened 
to be so. 

We didn’t sleep the first few 
stops, as a consequence. Our eyes 
burned in spite of the filters and 
we had roaring headaches, but 
we couldn’t sleep them off. We 
sat around looking at each other. 
Then Mclvers would say how 
good a beer would taste, and off 
we’d go. We’d have butchered 

18 



our grandmothers for one ice-cold 
bottle of beer. 

A FTER A few driving periods, 
I began to get my bearings 
at the wheel. We were moving 
down into desolation that made 
Earth’s old Death Valley look 
like a Japanese rose garden. Huge 
sun-baked cracks opened up in 
the floor of the gorge, with black 
cliffs jutting up on either side; 
the air was filled with a barely 
visible yellowish mist of sulfur 
and sulfurous gases. 

It was a hot, barren hell-hole, 
no place for any man to go, but 
the challenge was so powerful 
you could almost feel it. No one 
had ever crossed this land before 
and escaped. Those who had tried 
it had been cruelly punished, but 
the land was still there, so it had 
to be crossed. Not the easy way. 
It had to be crossed the hardest 
way possible: overland, through 
anything the land could throw 
up to us, at the most difficult time 
possible. 

Yet we knew that even the 
land might have been conquered 
before, except for that Sun. We’d 
fought absolute cold before and 
won. We’d never fought heat like 
this and won. The only worse 
heat in the Solar System was the 
surface of the Sun itself. 

Brightside was worth trying 
for. We would get it or it would 
get us. That was the bargain. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I learned a lot about Mercury 
those first few driving periods. 
The gorge petered out after a 
hundred miles and we moved on- 
to the slope of a range of ragged 
craters that ran south and east. 
This range had shown no activity 
since the first landing on Mer- 
cury forty years before, but be- 
yond it there were active cones. 
Yellow fumes rose from the crat- 
ers constantly; their sides were 
shrouded with heavy ash. 

We couldn’t detect a wind, but 
we knew there was a hot, sulfur- 
ous breeze sweeping in great con- 
tinental tides across the face of 
the planet. Not enough for ero- 
sion, though. The craters rose up 
out of jagged gorges, huge tower- 
ing spears of rock and rubble. Be- 
low were the vast yellow flat- 
lands, smoking and hissing from 
the gases beneath the crust. Over 
everything was gray dust — sili- 
cates and salts, pumice and lime- 
stone and granite ash, filling 
crevices and declivities — offer- 
ing a soft, treacherous surface for 
the Bug’s pillow tires. 

I learned to read the ground, 
to tell a covered fault by the sag 
of the dust; I learned to spot a 
passable crack, and tell it from 
an impassable cut. Time after 
time the Bugs ground to a halt 
while we explored a passage on 
foot, tied together with light cop- 
per cable, digging, advancing, dig- 
ging some more until we were 



sure the surface would carry the 
machines. It was cruel work; we 
slept in exhaustion. But it went 
smoothly, at first. 

Too smoothly, it seemed to me, 
and the others seemed to think 
so, too. 

IVTcIVERS’ restlessness was be- 
ginning to grate on our 
nerves. He talked too much, while 
we were resting or while we were 
driving; wisecracks, witticisms, 
unfunny jokes that wore thin 
with repetition. He took to mak- 
ing side trips from the route now 
and then, never far, but a little 
further each time. 

Jack Stone reacted quite the 
opposite; he grew quieter with 
each stop, mofe reserved and ap- 
prehensive. I didn’t like it, but 
I figured that it would pass off 
after a while. I was apprehen- 
sive enough myself; I just man- 
aged to hide it better. 

And every mile the Sun got 
bigger and whiter and higher in 
the sky and hotter. Without our 
ultra-violet screens and glare fil- 
ters we would have been blinded; 
as it was our eyes ached con- 
stantly and the skin on our faces 
itched and tingled at the end of 
an eight-hour trek. 

But it took one of those side 
trips of Mclvers’ to deliver the 
penultimate blow to our already 
fraying nerves. He had driven 
down a side-branch of a long can- 



BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING 



19 



yon running off west of our route 
and was almost out of sight in 
a cloud of ash when we heard a 
sharp cry through our earphones. 

I wheeled my Bug around with 
my heart in my throat and spot- 
ted him through the binocs, wav- 
ing frantically from the top of 
his machine. The Major and I 
took off, lumbering down the 
gulch after him as fast as the 
Bugs could go, with a thousand 
horrible pictures racing through 
our minds. 

We found him stand stock-still, 
pointing down the gorge and, for 
once, he didn’t have anything to 
say. It was the wreck of a Bug; 
an old-fashioned half-truck model 
of the sort that hadn’t been in 
use for years. It was wedged tight 
in a cut in the rock, an axle 
broken, its casing split wide open 
up the middle, half-buried in a 
rock slide. A dozen feet away 
were two insulated suits with 
white bones gleaming through 
the fiberglass helmets. 

This was as far as Wyatt and 
Carpenter had gotten on their 
Brightside Crossing. 

THE fifth driving period 
out, the terrain began to 
change. It looked the same, but 
every now and then it felt differ- 
ent. On two occasions I felt my 
wheels spin, with a howl of pro- 
test from my engine. Then, quite 
suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch; 

20 



I gunned my motor and nothing 
happened. 

I could see the dull gray stuff 
seeping up around the hubs, thick 
and tenacious, splattering around 
in steaming gobs as the wheels 
spun. I knew what had happened 
the moment the wheels gave and, 
a few minutes later, they chained 
me to the tractor and dragged me 
back out of the mire. It looked 
for all the world like thick gray 
mud, but it was a pit of molten 
lead, steaming under a soft layer 
of concealing ash. 

I picked my way more cau- 
tiously then. We were getting into 
an area of recent surface activity; 
the surface was really treach- 
erous. I caught myself wishing 
that the Major had okayed Mc- 
Ivers’ scheme for an advanced 
scout; more dangerous for the 
individual, maybe, but I was driv- 
ing blind now and I didn’t like it. 

One error in judgment could 
sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking 
much about the others. I was 
worried about me, plenty worried. 
I kept thinking, better Mclvers 
should go than me. It wasn’t 
healthy thinking and I knew it, 
but I couldn’t get the thought 
out of my mind. 

It was a grueling eight hours 
and we slept poorly. Back in the 
Bug again, we moved still more 
slowly — edging out on a broad 
flat plateau, dodging a network 
of gaping surface cracks — wind- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing back and forth in an effort 
to keep the machines on solid 
rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, 
because of the yellow haze rising 
from the cracks, so I was almost 
on top of it when I Saw a sharp 
cut ahead where the surface 
dropped six feet beyond a deep 
crack. 

I let out a shout to halt the 
others; then I edged my Bug for- 
ward, peering at the cleft. It was 
deep and wide. I moved fifty 
yards to the left, then back to the 
right. 

There was only one place 
that looked like a possible cross- 
ing; a long, narrow ledge of gray 
stuff that lay down across a sec- 
tion of the fault like a ramp. Even 
as I watched it, I could feel the 
surface crust under the Bug 
trembling and saw the ledge shift 
over a few feet. 

The Major’s voice sounded in 
my ears. “How about it, Peter?” 
“I don’t know. This crust is on 
roller skates,” I called back. 
“How about that ledge?” 

I hesitated. “I’m scared of it, 
Major. Let’s backtrack and try 
to find a way around.” 

There was a roar of disgust in 
my earphones and Mclvers’ Bug 
suddenly lurched forward. It 
rolled down past me, picked up 
speed, with Mclvers hunched be- 
hind the wheel like a race driver. 
He was heading past me straight 
for the gray ledge. 



Tl/TY SHOUT caught in my 
-L” throat; I heard the Major 
take a huge breath and roar: “My 
God, Mac, stop that thing, you 
fool!” and then Mclvers’ Bug was 
out on the ledge, lumbering across 
like a juggernaut. 

The ledge jolted as the tires 
struck it; for a horrible moment, 
it seemed to be sliding out from 
under the machine. And then the 
Bug was across in a cloud of dust, 
and I heard Mclvers’ voice in 
my ears, shouting in glee. “Come 
on, you slowpokes. It’ll hold you!” 
Something unprintable came 
through the earphones as the 
Major drew up alongside me and 
moved his Bug out on the ledge 
slowly and over to the other side. 
Then he said, “Take it slow, 
Peter. Then give Jack a hand 
with the sledges.” His voice 
sounded tight as a wire. 

Ten minutes later, we were on 
the other side of the cleft. The 
Major checked the whole column; 
then he turned on Mclvers angri- 
ly. “One more trick like that,” he 
said, “and I’ll strap you to a rock 
and leave you. Do you under- 
stand me? One more time — ” 
Mclvers’ voice was heavy with 
protest. “Good Lord, if we leave 
it up to Claney, he’ll have us out 
here forever! Any blind fool could 
see that that ledge would hold.” 
“I saw it moving,” I shot back 
at him. 

“All right, all right, so you’ve

got good eyes. Why all the fuss? 
We got across, didn’t we? But I 
say we’ve got to have a little 
nerve and use it once in a while 
if we’re ever going to get across 
this lousy hotbox.” 

“We need to use a little judg- 
ment, too,” the Major snapped. 
“All right, let’s roll. But if you 
think I was joking, you just try 
me out once.” He let it soak in 
for a minute. Then he geared his 
Bug on around to my flank again. 

At the stopover, the incident 
wasn’t mentioned again, but the 
Major drew me aside just as I 
was settling down for sleep. 
“Peter, I’m worried,” he said 
slowly. 

“Mclvers? Don’t worry. He’s 
not as reckless as he seems — 
just impatient. We are over a 
hundred miles behind schedule 
and we’re moving awfully slow. 
We only made forty miles this 
last drive.” 

The Major shook his head. “I 
don’t mean Mclvers. I mean the 
kid.” 

“Jack? What about him?” 

“Take a look.” 

S TONE WAS shaking. He was 
over near the tractor — away 
from the rest of us — and he 
was lying on his back, but he 
wasn’t asleep. His whole body 
was shaking, convulsively. I saw 
him grip an outcropping of rock 
hard. 

22 



I walked over and sat down 
beside him. “Get your water all 
right?” 1 said. 

He didn’t answer. He just kept 
on shaking. 

“Hey, boy,” I said. “What’s the 
trouble?” 

“It’s hot,” he said, choking out 
the words. 

“Sure it’s hot, but don’t let it 
throw you. We’re in really good 
shape.” 

“We’re not,” he snapped. 
“We’re in rotten shape, if you 
ask me. We’re not going to make 
it, do you know that? That crazy 
fool’s going to kill us for sure — ” 
All of a sudden, he was bawling 
like a baby. “I’m scared — I 
shouldn’t be here — I’m scared. 
What am I trying to prove by 
coming out here, for God’s sake? 
I’m some kind of hero or some- 
thing? I tell you I’m scared — ” 

“Look,” I said. “Mikuta’s 
scared, I’m scared. So what? We’ll 
make it, don’t worry. And no- 
body’s trying to be a hero.” 

“Nobody but Herb Stone,” he 
said bitterly. He shook himself 
and gave a tight little laugh. 
“Some hero, eh?” 

“We’ll make it,” I said. 

“Sure,” he said finally. “Sorry. 
I’ll be okay.” 

I rolled over, but waited until 
he was good and quiet. Then I 
tried to sleep, but I didn’t sleep 
too well. I kept thinking about 
that ledge. I’d known from the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



look of it what it was; a zinc 
slough of the sort Sanderson had 
warned us about, a wide sheet of 
almost pure zinc that had been 
thrown up white-hot from below, 
quite recently, just waiting for 
oxygen or sulfur to rot it through. 

I knew enough about zinc to 
know that at these temperatures 
it gets brittle as glass. Take a 
chance like Mclvers had taken 
and the whole sheet could snap 
like a dry pine board. But it 
wasn’t Mclvers’ fault that it 
hadn’t. 

F IVE HOURS later, we were 
back at the wheel. We were 
hardly moving at all. The ragged 
surface was almost impassable — 
great jutting rocks peppered the 
plateau; ledges crumbled the mo- 
ment my tires touched them; 
long, open canyons turned into 
lead-mires or sulfur pits. 

A dozen times I climbed out 
of the Bug to prod out an un- 
certain area with my boots and 
pikestaff. Whenever I did, Mc- 
lvers piled out behind me, run- 
ning ahead like a schoolboy at the 
fair, then climbing back again 
red-faced and panting, while we 
moved the machines ahead an- 
other mile or two. 

Time was pressing us now and 
Mclvers wouldn’t let me forget 
it. We had made only about 320 
miles in six driving periods, so 
we were about a hundred miles 

BRIGHTSIDE CROSSING 



or even more behind schedule. 

“We’re not going to make it,” 
Mclvers would complain angrily. 
“That Sun’s going to be out to 
aphelion by the time we hit the 
Center — ” 

“Sorry, but I can’t take it any 
faster,” I told him. I was getting 
good and mad. I knew what he 
wanted, but didn’t dare let him 
have it. I was scared enough 
pushing the Bug out on those 
ledges, even knowing that at least 
I was making the decisions. Put 
him in the lead and we wouldn’t 
last for eight hours. Our nerves 
wouldn’t take it, at any rate, even 
if the machines would. 

Jack Stone looked up from the 
aluminum chart sheets. “Another 
hundred miles and we should hit 
a good stretch,” he said. “Maybe 
we can make up distance there 
for a couple of days.” 

The Major agreed, but Mc- 
lvers couldn’t hold his impa- 
tience. He kept staring up at the 
Sun as if he had a personal 
grudge against it and stamped 
back and forth under the sun- 
shield. “That’ll be just fine,” he 
said. “If we ever get that far, that 
is.” 

We dropped it there, but the 
Major stopped me as we climbed 
aboard for the next run. “That 
guy’s going to blow wide open 
if we don’t move faster, Peter. I 
don’t want him in the lead, no 
matter what happens. He’s right 

23 



though, about the need to make 
better time. Keep your head, but 
crowd your luck a little, okay?” 
“I’ll try,” I said. It was asking 
the impossible and Mikuta knew 
it. We were on a long downward 
slope that shifted and buckled all 
around us, as though there were 
a molten underlay beneath the 
crust; the slope was broken by 
huge crevasses, partly covered 
with dust and zinc sheeting, like 
a vast glacier of stone and metal. 
The outside temperature regis- 
tered 547° F. and getting hotter. 



It was no place to start rushing 
ahead. 

T TRIED IT anyway. I took 
half a dozen shaky passages, 
edging slowly out on flat zinc 
ledges, then toppling over and 
across. It seemed easy for a while 
and we made progress. We hit an 
even stretch and raced ahead. 
And then I quickly jumped on 
my brakes and jerked the Bug 
to a halt in a cloud of dust. 

I’d gone too far. We were out 
on a wide, flat sheet of gray stuff, 




24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






apparently solid — until I’d sud- 
denly caught sight of the crevasse 
beneath in the corner of m> eye. 
It was an overhanging shell that 
trembled under me as I stopped. 

Mclvers’ voice was in my ear. 
“What’s the trouble now, 
Claney?” 

“Move back!” I shouted. “It 
can’t hold us!” 

“Looks solid enough from 
here.” 

“You want to argue about it? 
It’s too thin, it’ll snap. Move 
back!” 



I started edging back down the 
ledge. I heard Mclvers swear; 
then I saw his Bug start to creep 
outward on the shelf. Not fast or 
reckless, this time, but slowly, 
churning up dust in a gentle cloud 
behind him. 

I just stared and felt the blood 
rush to my head. It seemed so 
hot I could hardly breathe as he 
edged out beyond me, further 
and further — 

I think I felt it snap before I 
saw it. My own machine gave 
a sickening lurch and a long black

crack appeared across the shelf 
— and widened. Then the ledge 
began to upend. I heard a scream 
as Mclvers’ Bug rose up and up 
and then crashed down into the 
crevasse in a thundering slide of 
rock and shattered metal. 

I just stared for a full minute, 
I think. I couldn’t move until I 
heard Jack Stone groan and the 
Major shouting, “Claney! I 
couldn’t see — what happened?” 

“It snapped on him, that’s what 
happened,” I roared. I gunned my 
motor, edged forward toward the 
fresh broken edge of the shelf. 
The crevasse gaped; I couldn’t see 
any sign of the machine. Dust 
was still billowing up blindingly 
from below. 

We stood staring down, the 
three of us. I caught a glimpse of 
Jack Stone’s face through his hel- 
met. It wasn’t pretty. 

“Well,” said the Major heavily, 
“that’s that.” 

“I guess so.” I felt the way 
Stone looked. 

“Wait,” said Stone. “I heard 
something.” 

He had. It was a cry in the 
earphones — faint, but unmistak- 
able. 

“Mac!” The Major called. 
“Mac, can you hear me?” 

“Yeah, yeah. I can hear you.” 
The voice was very weak. 

“Are you all right?” 

“I don’t know. Broken leg, I 
think. It’s — hot.” There was a 

26 



long pause. Then: “I think my 
cooler’s gone out.” 

f I ''HE Major shot me a glance, 
then turned to Stone. “Get a 
cable from the second sledge 
fast. He’ll fry alive if we don’t 
get him out of there. Peter, I 
need you to lower me. Use the 
tractor winch.” 

I lowered him; he stayed down 
only a few moments. When I 
hauled him up, his face was 
drawn. “Still alive,” he panted. 
“He won’t be very long, though.” 
He hesitated for just an instant. 
“We’ve got to make a try.” 

“I don’t like this ledge,” I said. 
“It’s moved twice since I got out. 
Why not back off and lower him 
a cable?” 

“No good. The Bug is smashed 
and he’s inside it. We’ll need 
torches and I’ll need one of you 
to help.” He looked at me and 
then ga^e Stone a long look. 
“Peter, you’d better come.” 

“Wait,” said Stone. His face 
was very white. “Let me go down 
with you.” 

“Peter is lighter.” 

“I’m not so heavy. Let me go 
down.” 

“Okay, if that’s the way you 
want it.” The Major tossed him 
a torch. “Peter, check these 
hitches and lower us slowly. If 
you see any kind of trouble, any- 
thing, cast yourself free and back 
off this thing, do you understand? 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



This whole ledge may go.” 

I nodded. “Good luck.” 

They went over the ledge. I let 
the cable down bit by bit until it 
hit two hundred feet and slacked 
off. 

“How does it look?” I shouted. 
“Bad,” said the Major. “We’ll 
have to work fast. This whole 
side of the crevasse is ready to 
crumble. Down a little more.” 
Minutes passed without a 
sound. I tried to relax, but I 
couldn’t. Then I felt the ground 
shift, and the tractor lurched to 
the side. 

The Major shouted, “It’s go- 
ing, Peter — pull back!” and I 
threw the tractor into reverse, 
jerked the controls as the tractor 
rumbled off the shelf. The cable 
snapped, coiled up in front like 
a broken clockspring. The whole 
surface under me was shaking 
wildly now; ash rose in huge gray 
clouds. Then, with a roar, the 
whole shelf lurched and slid side- 
ways. It teetered on the edge for 
seconds before it crashed into the 
crevasse, tearing the side wall 
down with it in a mammoth slide. 
I jerked the tractor to a halt as 
the dust and flame billowed up. 

They were gone — all three 
of them, Mclvers and the Major 
and Jack Stone — buried under 
a thousand tons of rock and zinc 
and molten lead. There wasn’t 
any danger of anybody ever find- 
ing their bones. 



"DETER Claney leaned back, 
finishing his drink, rubbing 
his scarred face as he looked 
across at Baron. 

Slowly, Baron’s grip relaxed on 
the chair arm. “You got back,” he 
said. 

Claney nodded. “I got back, 
sure. I had the tractor and the 
sledges. I had seven days to drive 
back under that yellow Sun. I 
had plenty of time to think.” 
“You took the wrong man 
along,” Baron said. “That was 
your mistake. Without him you 
would have made it.” 

“Never.” Claney shook his 
head. “That’s what I was think- 
ing the first day or so — that it 
was Mclvers’ fault, that he was to 
blame. But that isn’t true. He 
was wild, reckless and had lots 
of nerve.” 

“But his judgment was bad!” 
“It couldn’t have been sounder. 
We had to keep to our schedule 
even if it killed us, because it 
would positively kill us if we 
didn’t.” 

“But a man like that — ” 

“A man like Mclvers was neces- 
sary. Can’t you see that? It was 
the Sun that beat us, that surface. 
Perhaps we were licked the very 
day we started.” Claney leaned 
across the table, his eyes plead- 
ing. “We didn’t realize that, but 
it was true. There are places that 
men can’t go, conditions men 
can’t tolerate. The others had to

die to learn that. I was lucky, I 
came back. But I’m trying to tell 
you what I found out — that 
nobody will ever make a Bright- 
side Crossing.” 

“We will,” said Baron. “It won’t 
be a picnic, but we’ll make it.” 

“But suppose you do,” said 
Claney, suddenly. “Suppose I’m 
all wrong, suppose you do make 
it. Then what? What comes 
next?” 

“The Sun,” said Baron. 

Claney nodded slowly. “Yes. 
That would be it, wouldn’t it?” 
He laughed. “Good-by, Baron. 
Jolly talk and all that. Thanks 
for listening.” 



Baron caught his wrist as he 
started to rise. “Just one question 
more, Claney. Why did you 
come here?” 

“To try to talk you out of kill- 
ing yourself,” said Claney. 

“You’re a liar,” said Baron. 

Claney stared down at him for 
a long moment. Then he 
crumpled in the chair. There was 
defeat in his pale blue eyes and 
something else. 

“Well?” 

Peter Claney spread his hands, 
a helpless gesture. “When do you 
leave, Baron? I want you to 
take me along.”

The 

Dwindling 

Years 



He didn't expect to be last— 
but neither did he anticipate 
the horror of being the first! 



By LESTER DEL REY 



EARLY TWO hundred 
years of habit carried the 
chairman of Exodus Cor- 
poration through the morning ri- 
tual of crossing the executive 
floor. Giles made the expected 
comments, smiled the proper 
smiles and greeted his staff by 
the right names, but it was purely 
automatic. Somehow, thinking 
had grown difficult in the morn- 
ings recently. 



Inside his private office, he 
dropped all pretense and slumped 
into the padding of his chair, gasp- 
ing for breath and feeling his 
heart hammering in his chest. 
He’d been a fool to come to work, 
he realized. But with the Procyon 
shuttle arriving yesterday, there 
was no telling what might turn 
up. Besides, that fool of a medi- 
cist had sworn the shot would 
cure any allergy or asthma.

Giles heard his secretary come 
in, but it wasn’t until the smell 
of the coffee reached his nose 
that he looked up. She handed 
him a filled cup and set the carafe 
down on the age-polished sur- 
face of the big desk. She watched 
solicitously as he drank. 

“That bad, Arthur?” she asked. 

“Just a little tired,” he told 
her, refilling the cup. She’d, made 
the coffee stronger than usual 
and it seemed to cut through 
some of the thickness in his head. 
“I guess I’m getting old, Amanda.” 

She smiled dutifully at the 
time-worn joke, but he knew she 
wasn’t fooled. She’d cycled to 
middle age four times in her 
job and she probably knew him 
better than he knew himself — 
which wouldn’t be hard, he 
thought. He’d hardly recognized 
the stronger in the mirror as he 
tried to shave. His normal thin- 
ness had looked almost gaunt 
and there were hollows in his 
face and circles under his eyes. 
Even his hair had seemed thin- 
ner, though that, of course, was 
impossible. 

“Anything urgent on the Pro- 
cyon shuttle?” he asked as she 
continue staring at him with wor- 
ried eyes. 

S HE JERKED her gaze away 
guiltily and turned to the in- 
coming basket. “Mostly drugs for 
experimenting. A personal letter 

30 



for you, relayed from some place 
I never heard of. And one of the 
super-light missiles! They found 
it drifting half a light-year out 
and captured it. Jordan’s got a 
report on it and he’s going crazy. 
But if you don’t feel well — ” 

“I’m all right!” he told her 
sharply. Then he steadied himself 
and managed to smile. “Thanks 
for the coffee, Amanda.” 

She accepted dismissal reluc- 
tantly. When she was gone, he 
sat gazing at the report from Jor- 
dan at Research. 

For eighty years now, they’d 
been sending out the little ships 
that vanished at greater than the 
speed of light, equipped with 
every conceivable device to make 
them return automatically after 
taking pictures of wherever they 
arrived. So far, none had ever re- 
turned or been located. This was 
the first hope they’d found that 
the century-long trips between 
stars in the ponderous shuttles 
might be ended and he should 
have been filled with excitement 
at Jordan’s hasty preliminary re- 
port. 

He leafed through it. The little 
ship apparently had been picked 
up by accident when it almost 
collided with a Sirius-local ship. 
Scientists there had puzzled over 
it, reset it and sent it back. The 
two white rats on it had still been 
alive. 

Giles dropped the report wear- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE DWINDLING 



YEARS

ily and picked up the personal 
message that had come on the 
shuttle. He fingered the micro- 
strip inside while he drank ano- 
ther coffee, and finally pulled 
out the microviewer. There were 
three frames to the message, he 
saw with some surprise. 

He didn’t need to see the sig- 
nature on the first projection. 
Only his youngest son would have 
sent an elaborate tercentenary 
greeting verse — one that would 
arrive ninety years too late! Harry 
had been born just before Earth 
passed the drastic birth limita- 
tion act and his mother had 
spoiled him. He’d even tried to 
avoid the compulsory emigration 
draft and stay on with his mo- 
ther. It had been the bitter quar- 
rels over that which had finally 
broken Giles’ fifth marriage. 

Oddly enough, the message in 
the next frame showed none of 
that. Harry had nothing but 
praise for the solar system where 
he’d been sent. He barely men- 
tioned being married on the way 
or his dozen children, but filled 
most of the frame with glowing 
description and a plea for his 
father to join him there! 

G ILES SNORTED and turned 
to the third frame, which 
showed a group picture of the 
family in some sort of vehicle, 
against the background of an al- 
ien but attractive world. 

32 



He had no desire to spend 
ninety years cooped up with a 
bunch of callow young emigrants, 
even in one of the improved Ex- 
odus shuttles. And even if Ex- 
odus ever got the super-light 
drive working, there was no rea- 
son he should give up his work. 
The discovery that men could 
live practically forever had put 
an end to most family ties; senti- 
ment wore thin in half a cen- 
tury — which wasn’t much time 
now, though it had once seemed 
long enough. 

Strange how the years seemed 
to get shorter as their number in- 
creased. There’d been a song 
once — something about the years 
dwindling down. He groped for 
the lines and couldn’t remember. 
Drat it! Now he’d probably lie 
awake most of the night again, 
trying to recall them. 

The outside line buzzed musi- 
cally, flashing Research’s number. 
Giles grunted in irritation. He 
wasn’t ready to face Jordan yet. 
But he shrugged and pressed the 
button. 

The intense face that looked 
from the screen was frowning as 
Jordan’s eyes seemed to sweep 
around the room. He was still 
young — one of the few under 
a hundred who’d escaped deporta- 
tion because of special ability — 
and patience was still foreign to 
him. 

Then the frown vanished as 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an expression of shock replaced 
it, and Giles felt a sinking sensa- 
tion. If he looked that bad — 

But Jordan wasn’t looking at 
him; the man’s interest lay in the 
projected picture from Harry, a- 
cross the desk from the communi- 
cator. 

“Antigravity!” His voice was 
unbelieving as he turned his head 
to face the older man. “What 
world is that?” 

Giles forced his attention on 
the picture again and this time 
he noticed the vehicle shown. It 
was enough like an old model 
Earth conveyance to pass casual 
inspection, but it floated wheel- 
lessly above the ground. Faint 
blur lines indicated it had been 
moving when the picture was 
taken. 

“One of my sons — ” Giles 
started to answer. “I could find 
the star’s designation . 

Jordan cursed harshly. “So we 
can send a message on the shuttle, 
begging for their secret in a 
couple of hundred years! While 
a hundred other worlds make a 
thousand major discoveries they 
don’t bother reporting! Can’t the 
Council see anything?” 

Giles had heard it all before. 
Earth was becoming a backwater 
world; no real progress had been 
made in two centuries; the young 
men were sent out as soon as 
their first fifty years of education 
were finished, and the older men 

THE DWINDLING YEARS 



were too conservative for really 
new thinking. There was a mea- 
sure of truth in it, unfortunately. 

“They’ll slow up when their 
populations fill,” Giles repeated 
his old answers. “We’re still ahead 
in medicine and we’ll get the 
other discoveries eventually, with- 
out interrupting the work of mak- 
ing the Earth fit for our longevity. 
We can wait. We’ll have to.” 

r pHE YOUNGER man stared 
at him with the strange puz- 
zled look Giles had seen too often 
lately. “Damn it, haven’t you read 
my report? We know the super- 
light drive works! That missile 
reached Sirius in less than ten 
days. We can have the secret of 
this antigravity in less than a 
year! We — ” 

“Wait a minute.” Giles felt the 
thickness pushing back at his 
mind and tried to fight it off. He’d 
only skimmed the report, but this 
made no sense. “You mean you 
can calibrate your guiding de- 
vices accurately enough to get a 
missile where you want it and 
back?” 

“What?” Jordan’s voice rattled 
the speaker. “Of course not! It 
took two accidents to get the 
thing back to us — and with a 
half-light-year miss that delayed 
it about twenty years before the 
Procyon shuttle heard its signal. 
Pre-setting a course may take 
centuries, if we can ever master 

33 



it. Even with Sirius expecting the 
missiles and ready to cooperate. 
I mean the big ship. We’ve had it 
drafted for building long enough; 
now we can finish it in three 
months. We know the drive works. 
We know it’s fast enough to reach 
Procyon in two weeks. We even 
know life can stand the trip. The 
rats were unharmed.” 

Giles shook his head at what 
the other was proposing, only 
partly believing it. “Rats don’t 
have minds that could show any 
real damage such as the loss of 
power to rejuvenate. We can’t put 
human pilots into a ship with our 
drive until we’ve tested it more 
thoroughly, Bill, even if they 
could correct for errors on arrival. 
Maybe if we put in stronger sig- 
naling transmitters . 

“Yeah. Maybe in two centuries 
we’d have a through route charted 
to Sirius. And we still wouldn’t 
have proved it safe for human 
pilots. Mr. Giles, we’ve got to 
have the big ship. All we need is 
one volunteer!” 

It occurred to Giles then that 
the man had been too fired with 
the idea to think. He leaned back, 
shaking his head again wearily. 
“Ajl right, Bill. Find me one vol- 
unteer. Or how about you? Do 
you really want to risk losing the 
rest of your life rather than wait- 
ing a couple more centuries until 
we know it’s safe? If you do, I’ll 
order the big ship.” 

34 



Jordan opened his mouth and 
for a second Giles’ heart caught 
in a flux of emotions as the 
man’s offer hovered op his lips. 
Then the engineer shut his mouth 
slowly. The belligerence ran out 
of him. 

He looked sick, for he had no 
answer. 

~jVT O SANE man would risk a 

’ chance for near eternity 
against such a relatively short 
wait. Heroism had belonged to 
those who knew their days were 
numbered, anyhow. 

“Forget it, Bill,” Giles advised. 
“It may take longer, but even- 
tually we’ll find a way. With time 
enough, we’re bound to. And 
when we do, the ship will be 
ready.” 

The engineer nodded miser- 
ably and clicked off. Giles turned 
from the blank screen to stare 
out of the windows, while his 
hand came up to twist at the lock 
of hair over his forehead. Etern- 
ity! They had to plan and build 
for it. They couldn’t risk that 
plan for short-term benefits. Usu- 
ally it was too easy to realize that, 
and the sight of the solid, time- 
enduring buildings outside should 
have given him a sense of secur- 
ity. 

Today, though, nothing seemed 
to help. He felt choked, impri- 
soned, somehow lost; the city be- 
yond the window blurred as he 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



studied it, and he swung the chair 
back so violently that his hand 
jerked painfully on the forelock 
he’d been twisting. 

Then he was staring unbeliev- 
ingly at the single white hair that 
was twisted with the dark ones 
between his fingers. 

Like an automaton, he bent 
forward, his other hand groping 
for the mirror that should be in 
one of the drawers. The dull pain 
in his chest sharpened and his 
breath was hoarse in his throat, 
but he hardly noticed as he found 
the mirror and brought it up. His 
eyes focused reluctantly. There 
were other white strands in his 
dark hair. 

The mirror crashed to the floor 
as he staggered out of the office. 

It was only two blocks to Giles’ 
residence club, but he had to 
stop twice to catch his breath 
and fight against the pain that 
clawed at his chest. When he 
reached the wood-paneled lobby, 
he was barely able to stand. 

Dubbins was at his side al- 
most at once, with a hand^under 
his arm to guide him toward his 
suite. 

“Let me help you, sir,” Dub- 
bins suggested, in the tones 
Giles hadn’t heard since the man 
had been his valet, back when 
it was still possible to find per- 
sonal servants. Now he managed 
the club on a level of quasi-equal- 
ity with the members. For the 



moment, though, he’d slipped 
back into the old ways. 

r< ILES FOUND himself lying 
on his couch, partially un- 
dressed, with the pillows just right 
and a long drink in his hand. The 
alcohol combined with the reac- 
tion from his panic to leave him 
almost himself again. After all, 
there was nothing to worry about; 
Earth’s doctors could cure any- 
thing. 

“I guess you’d better call Dr. 
Vincenti,” he decided. Vincenti 
was a member and would prob- 
ably be the quickest to get. 

Dubbins shook his head. “Dr. 
Vincenti isn’t with us, sir. He 
left a year ago to visit a son in 
the Centauri system. There’s a 
Dr. Cobb whose reputation is 
very good, sir.” 

Giles puzzled over it doubtful- 
ly. Vincenti had been an oddly 
morose man the last few times 
he’d seen him, but that could 
hardly explain his taking a twen- 
ty-year shuttle trip for such a 
slim reason. It was no concern of 
his, though. “Dr. Cobb, then,” he 
said. 

Giles heard the other man’s 
voice on the study phone, too low 
for the words to be distinguish- 
able. He finished the drink, feel- 
ing still better, and was sitting 
up when Dubbins came back. 

“Dr. Cobb wants you to come 
to his office at once, sir,” he said, 



THE DWINDLING YEARS 



35 



dropping to his knee to help 
Giles with his shoes. “I’d be 
pleased to drive you there.” 

Giles frowned. He’d expected 
Cobb to come to him. Then he 
grimaced at his own thoughts. 
Dubbins’ manners must have car- 
ried him back into the past; doc- 
tors didn’t go in for home visits 
now — they preferred to see their 
patients in the laboratories that 
housed their offices. If this kept 
on, he’d be missing the old days 
when he’d had a mansion and 
counted his wealth in possessions, 
instead of the treasures he could 
build inside himself for the fu- 
ture ahead. He was getting possi- 
tively childish! 

Yet he relished the feeling of 
having Dubbins drive his car. 
More than anything else, he’d 
loved being driven. Even after 
chauffeurs were a thing of the 
past, Harry had driven him 
around. Now he’d taken to walk- 
ing, as so many others had, for 
even with modern safety meas- 
ures so strict, there was always 
a small chance of some accident 
and nobody had any desire to 
spend the long future as a cripple. 

“I’ll wait for you, sir,” Dubbins, 
offered as they stopped beside 
the low, massive medical building. 

It was almost too much con- 
sideration. Giles nodded, got out 
and headed down the hall un- 
certainly. Just how bad did he 
look? Well, he’d soon find out. 

36 



He located the directory and 
finally found the right office, its 
reception room wall covered 
with all the degrees Dr. Cobb had 
picked up in some three hun- 
dred years of practice. Giles felt 
better, realizing it wouldn’t be 
one of the younger men. 

C OBB APPEARED himself, 
before the nurse could take 
over, and led Giles into a room 
with an old-fashioned desk and 
chairs that almost concealed the 
cabinets of equipment beyond. 

He listened as Giles stumbled 
out his story. Halfway through, 
the nurse took a blood sample 
with one of the little mosquito 
needles and the machinery be- 
hind the doctor began working on 
it. 

“Your friend told me about the 
gray hair, of course,” Cobb said. 
At Giles’ look, he smiled faintly. 
“Surely you didn’t think people 
could miss that in this day and 
age? Let’s see it.” 

He inspected it and began 
making tests. Some were older 
than Giles could remember — 
knee reflex, blood pressure, pulse 
and fluoroscope. Others involved 
complicated little gadgets that 
ran over his body, while meters 
bobbed and wiggled. The blood 
check came through and Cobb 
studied it, to go back and make 
further inspections of his own. 

At last he nodded slowly. “Hy- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



per-catabolism, of course. I 
thought it might be. How long 
since you had your last rejuvena- 
tion? And who gave it?” 

“About ten years ago,” Giles 
answered. He found his identity 
card and passed it over, while 
the doctor studied it. “My six- 
teenth.” 

It wasn’t going right. He could 
feel it. Some of the panic symp- 
toms were returning; the pulse in 
his neck was pounding and his 
breath was growing difficult. 
Sweat ran down his sides from 
his armpit and he wiped his palms 
against his coat. 

“Any particular emotional 
strain when you were treated — 
some major upset in your life?” 
Cobb asked. 

Giles thought as carefully as 
he could, but he remembered 
nothing like that. “You mean — 
it didn’t take? But I never had 
any trouble-, Doctor. I was one of 
the first million cases, when a 
lot of people couldn’t rejuvenate 
at all, and I had no trouble even 
then.” 

Cobb considered it, hesitated as 
if making up his mind to be frank 
against his better judgment. “I 
can’t see any other explanation. 
You’ve got a slight case of angina 
— nothing serious, but quite de- 
finite — as well as other signs 
of aging. I’m afraid the treatment 
didn’t take fully. It might have 
been some unconscious block 

THE DWINDLING YEARS 



on your part, some infection not 
diagnosed at the time, or even a 
fault in the treatment. That’s 
pretty rare, but we can’t neglect 
the possibility.” 

H E STUDIED his charts again 
and then smiled. “So we’ll 
give you another treatment. Any 
reason you can’t begin immedi- 
ately?” 

Giles remembered that Dub- 
bins was waiting for him, but this 
was more important. It hadn’t 
been a joke about his growing old, 
after all. But now, in a few days, 
he’d be his old — no, of course 
not — his young self again! 

They went down the jiall to 
another office, where Giles waited 
outside while Cobb conferred 
with another doctor and techni- 
cian, with much waving of charts. 
He resented every second of it. 
It was as if the almost forgotten 
specter of age stood beside him, 
counting the seconds. But at last 
they were through and he was led 
into the quiet rejuvenation room, 
where the clamps were adjusted 
about his head and the earpieces 
were fitted. The drugs were shot 
painlessly into his arm and the 
light-pulser was adjusted to his 
brain-wave pattern. 

It had been nothing like this his 
first time. Then it had required 
months of mental training, fol- 
lowed by crude mechanical and 
drug hypnosis for other months. 

37 



Somewhere in every human brain 
lay the memory of what his cells 
had been like when he was young. 
Or perhaps it lay in the cells 
themselves, with the brain as only 
a linkage to it. They’d discovered 
that, and the fact that the mind 
could effect physical changes in 
the body. Even such things as 
cancer could be willed out of ex- 
istence — provided the brain 
could be reached far below the 
conscious level and forced to 
operate. 

There had been impossible 
faith cures for millenia — catar- 
acts removed from blinded eyes 
within minutes, even — but find- 
ing the mechanism in the brain 
that worked those miracles had 
taken an incredible amount of 
study and finding a means of 
bringing it under control had 
taken even longer. 

Now they did it with dozens of 
mechanical aids in addition to 
the hypnotic instructions — and 
did it usually in a single sitting, 
with the full transformation of 
the body taking less than a week 
after the treatment! 

But with all the equipment, it 
wasn’t impossible for a mistake 
to happen. It had been no fault of 
his ... he was sure of that . his 
mind was easy to reach ... he 
could relax so easily . 

He came out of it without 
even a headache, while they were 
removing the probes, but the fa- 



tigue on the operator’s face told 
him it had been a long and diffi- 
cult job. He stretched experimen- 
tally, with the eternal uncon- 
scious expectation that he would 
find himself suddenly young 
again. Byt that, of course, was ridi- 
culous. It took days for the mind 
to work on all the cells and to 
repair the damage of time. 

C OBB LED him back to the 
first office, where he was given 
an injection of some kind and 
another sample of his blood was 
taken, while the earlier tests were 
repeated. But finally the doctor 
nodded. 

“That’s all for now, Mr. Giles. 
You might drop in tomorrow 
morning, after I’ve had a chance 
to complete my study of all this. 
We’ll know by then whether you’ll 
need more treatment. Ten o’clock 
okay?” 

“But I’ll be all right?” 

Cobb smiled the automatic re- 
assurance of his profession. “We 
haven’t lost a patient in two hun- 
dred years, to my knowledge.” 
“Thanks,” said Giles. “Ten 
o’clock is fine.” 

Dubbins was still waiting, read- 
ing a paper whose headlined fea- 
ture carried a glowing account of 
the discovery of the super-light 
missile and what it might mean. 
He took a quick look at Giles and 
pointed to it. “Great work, Mr. 
Giles. Maybe we’ll all get to see 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



some of those other worlds yet.” 
Then he studied Giles more care- 
fully. “Everything’s in good shape 
now, sir?” 

“The doctor says everything’s 
going to be fine,” Giles answered. 

It was then he realized for the 
first time that Cobb had said no 
such thing. A statement that 
lightning had never struck a 
house was no guarantee that it 
never would. It was an evasion 
meant to give such an impression. 

The worry nagged at him all 
the way back. Word had already 
gone around the club that he’d 
had some kind of attack and 
there were endless questions that 
kept it on his mind. And even 
when it had been covered and 
recovered, he could still sense the 
glances of the others, as if he 
were Vincenti in one of the man’s 
more morose moods. 

He found a single table in the 
dining room and picked his way 
through the meal, listening to 
the conversation about him only 
when it was necessary because 
someone called across to him. 
Ordinarily, he was quick to sup- 
port the idea of clubs in place 
of private families. A man here 
could choose his group and grow 
into them. Yet he wasn’t swal- 
lowed by them, as he might be by 
a family. Giles had been living 
here for nearly a century now and 
he’d never regretted it. But to- 
night his own group irritated him. 



He puzzled over it, finding no 
real reason. Certainly they were- 
n’t forcing themselves on him. He 
remembered once when he’d had 
a cold, before they finally licked 
that; Harry had been a complete 
nuisance, running around with 
various nostrums, giving him no 
peace. Constant questions about 
how he felt, constant little looks 
of worry — until he’d been ready 
to yell at the boy. In fact, he 
had. 

Funny, he couldn’t picture real- 
ly losing his temper here. Fami- 
lies did odd things to a man. 

H E LISTENED to a few of 
the discussions after the din- 
ner, but he’d heard them all be- 
fore, except for one about the 
super-speed drive, and there he 
had no wish to talk until he could 
study the final report. He gave up 
at last and went to his own suite. 
What he needed was a good 
night’s sleep after a little relaxa- 
tion. 

Even that failed him, though. 
He’d developed one the finest 
chess collections in the world, but 
tonight it held no interest. And 
when he drew out his tools and 
tried working on the delicate, 
lovely jade for the set he was 
carving his hands seemed to be 
all thumbs. None of the other in- 
terests he’d developed through 
the years helped to add to the 
richness of living now. 



THE DWINDLING YEARS 



39 



He gave it up and went to bed 

— to have the fragment of that 
song pop into his head. Now there 
was no escaping it. Something 
about the years — or was it days 

— dwindling down to something 
or other. 

Could they really dwindle 
down? Suppose he couldn’t reju- 
venate all the way? He knew 
that there were some people who 
didn’t respond as well as others. 
Sol Graves, for instance. He’d 
been fifty when he finally learned 
how to work with the doctors and 
they could only bring him back to 
about thirty, instead of the nor- 
mal early twenties. Would that 
reduce the slice of eternity that 
rejuvenation meant? And what 
had happened to Sol? 

Or suppose it wasn’t rejuve- 
nation, after all; suppose some- 
thing had gone wrong with him 
permanently? 

He fought that off, but he 
couldn’t escape the nagging 
doubts at the doctor’s words. 

He got up once to stare at him- 
self in the mirror. Ten hours had 
gone by and there should have 
been some signs of improvement. 
He couldn’t be sure, though, 
whether there were or not. 

He looked no better the next 
morning when he finally dragged 
himself up from the little sleep 
he’d managed to get. The hollows 
U'ere still there and the circles 
under his eyes. He searched for 

40 



the gray in his hair, but the trai- 
torous strands had been removed 
at the doctor’s office and he could 
find no new ones. 

He looked into the dining room 
and then went by hastily. He 
wanted no solicitous glances this 
morning. Drat it, maybe he 
should move out. Maybe trying 
family life again would give him 
some new interests. Amanda prob- 
ably would be willing to marry 
him; she’d hinted at a date once. 

He stopped, shocked by the 
awareness that he hadn’t been out 
with a woman for . 

He couldn’t remember how 
long it had been. Nor why. 

“In the spring, a young man’s 
fancy,” he quoted to himself, and 
then shuddered. 

It hadn’t been that kind of 
spring for him — not this reju- 
venation nor the last, nor the one 
before that. 

G ILES TRIED to stop scaring 
himself and partially succeed- 
ed, until he reached the doctor’s 
office. Then it was no longer ne- 
cessary to frighten himself. The 
wrongness was too strong, no mat- 
ter how professional Cobb’s smile! 

He didn’t hear the preliminary 
words. He watched the smile van- 
ish as the stack of reports came 
out. There was no nurse here 
now. The machines were quiet — 
and all the doors were shut. 
Giles shook his head, interrupt- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing the doctor’s technical jargon. 
Now that he knew there was rea- 
son for his fear, it seemed to 
vanish, leaving a coldness that 
numbed him. 

“I’d rather know the whole 
truth,” he said. His voice sounded 
dead in his ears. “The worst first. 
The rejuvenation . .?” 

Cobb sighed and yet seemed re- 
lieved. “Failed.” He stopped, and 
his hands touched the reports on 
his desk. “Completely,” he added 
in a low, defeated tone. 

“But I thought that was impos- 
sible!” 

“So did I. I wouldn’t believe 
it even yet — but now I find it 
isn’t the" first case. I spent the 
night at Medical Center going up 
the ranks until I found men who 
really know about it. And now I 
wish I hadn’t.” His voice ran 
down and he gathered himself to- 
gether by an effort. “It’s a shock 
to me, too, Mr. Giles. But — well, 
to simplify it, no memory is per- 
fect — even cellular memory. It 
loses a little each time. And the 
effect is cumulative. It’s like an 
asymptotic curve — the further it 
goes, the steeper the curve. And 
— well, you’ve passed too far.” 

He faced away from Giles, 
dropping the reports into a 
drawer and locking it. “I wasn’t 
supposed to tell you, of course. 
It’s going to be tough enough 
when they’re ready to let people 
know. But you aren’t the first and 



you won’t be the last, if that’s any 
consolation. We’ve got a longer 
time scale than we used to have 
- — but it’s in centuries, not in 
eons. For everybody, not just 
you.” 

It was no consolation. Giles 
nodded mechanically. “I won’t 
talk, of course. How — how long?” 

Cobb spread his hands unhap- 
pily. “Thirty years, maybe. But 
we can make them better. Geri- 
atric knowledge is still on record. 
We can fix the heart and all the 
rest. You’ll be in good physical 
condition, better than your grand- 
father — ” 

“And then . .” Giles couldn’t 
pronounce the words. He’d grown 
old and he’d grow older. And 
eventually he’d die! 

An immortal man had sudden- 
ly found death hovering on his 
trail. The years had dwindled and 
gone, and only a few were left. 

He stood up, holding out his 
hand. “Thank you, Doctor,” he 
said, and was surprised to find 
he meant it. The man had done 
all he could and had at least 
saved him the suspense of grow- 
ing doubt and horrible eventual 
discovery. 

UTSIDE ON the street, he 
” looked up at the Sun and 
then at the buildings built to last 
for thousands of years. Their 
eternity was no longer a part of 
him. 



THE DWINDLING YEARS 



41 



Even his car would outlast him. 

He climbed into it, still partly 
numbed, and began driving me- 
chanically, no longer wondering 
about the dangers that might pos- 
sibly arise. Those wouldn’t mat- 
ter much now. For a man who 
had thought of living almost for- 
ever, thirty years was too short 
a time to count. 

He was passing near the club 
and started to slow. Then he 
went on without stopping. He 
wanted no chance to have them 
asking questions he couldn’t an- 
swer. It was none of their busi- 
ness. Dubbins had been kind — 
but now Giles wanted no kind- 
ness. 

The street led to the office 
and he drove on. What else was 
there for him? There, at least, he 
could still fill his time with work 
— work that might even be use- 
ful. In the future, men would 
need the super-light drive if they 
were to span much more of the 
Universe than now. And he could 
speed up the work in some ways 
still, even if he could never see 
its finish. 

It would be cold comfort but it 
was something. And he might 
keep busy enough to forget some- 
times that the years were gone 
for him. 

Automatic habit carried him 
through the office again, to Aman- 
da’s desk, where her worry was 
still riding her. He managed a 



grin and somehow the right words 
came to his lips. “I saw the doc- 
tor, Amanda, so you can stop 
figuring ways to get me there.” 

She smiled back suddenly, with- 
out feigning it. “Then you’re all 
right?” 

“As all right as I’ll ever be,” 
he told her. “They tell me I’m just 
growing old.” 

This time her laugh was heart- 
ier. He caught himself before he 
could echo her mirth in a different 
voice and went inside where she 
had the coffee waiting for him. 

Oddly, it still tasted good to 
him. 

The projection was off, he saw, 
wondering whether he’d left it on 
or not. He snapped the switch and 
saw the screen light up, with the 
people still in the odd, wheelless 
vehicle on the alien planet. 

OR A long moment, he stared 
■*- at the picture without think- 
ing, and then bent closer. Harry’s 
face hadn’t changed much. Giles 
had almost forgotten it, but there 
was still the same grin there. And 
his grandchildren had a touch 
of it, too. And of their grand- 
father’s nose, he thought. Funny, 
he’d never seen even pictures of 
his other grandchildren. Family 
ties melted away too fast for in- 
terstellar travel. 

Y et there seemed to be no 
slackening of them in Harry’s 
case, and somehow it looked like 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a family, rather than a mere 
group. A very pleasant family in 
a very pleasant world. 

He read Harry’s note again, 
with its praise for the planet and 
its invitation. He wondered if 
Dr. Vincenti had received an in- 
vitation like that, before he left. 
Or had he even been one of those 
to whom the same report had 
been delivered by some doctor? 
It didn’t matter, but it would ex- 
plain things, at least. 

Twenty years to Centaurus, 
while the years dwindled down — •** 
Then abruptly the line finished 
itself. “The years dwindle down 
to a precious few . he remem- 
bered. “A precious few.” 

Those dwindling years had 
been precious once. He unexpect- 
edly recalled his own grand- 
father holding him on an old 
knee and slipping him candy 
that was forbidden. The years 
seemed precious to the old man 
then. 

Amanda’s voice came abruptly 
over the intercom. “Jordan wants 
to talk to you,” she said, and the 
irritation was sharp in her voice. 
“He won’t take no!” 

Giles shrugged and reached for 



the projector, to cut it off. Then, 
on impulse, he set it back to the 
picture, studying the group again 
as he switched on Jordan’s wire. 

But he didn’t wait for the hot 
words about whatever was the 
trouble. 

“Bill,” he said, “start getting 
the big ship into production. I’ve 
found a volunteer.” 

He’d been driven to it, he knew, 
as he watched the man’s amazed 
face snap from the screen. From 
the first suspicion of his trouble, 
something inside him had been 
forcing him to make this decision. 
And maybe it would do no good. 
Maybe the ship would fail. But 
thirty years was a number a man 
could risk. 

If he made it, though . 

Well, he’d see those grand- 
children of Ijis this year — and 
Harry. Maybe he’d even tell 
Harry the truth, once they got 
done celebrating the reunion. And 
there’d be other grandchildren. 
With the ship, he’d have time 
enough to look them up. Plenty 
of time! 

Thirty years was a long time, 
when he stopped to think of it.

FYR GREGEYS AND 
WYLDE-FYR 

R epeatedly, in the 

past, I have had whole 
columns devoted exclu- 
sively to themes provoked by let- 
ters from my readers. This is 
another of these columns and the 
first theme I want to take up is 
that of “Greek Fire.” 

Earlier this year, I received a 
letter from a reader in which I 
was asked whether anything is 
known about the composition of 
“Greek Fire.” My correspondent 
wrote that a book printed in 1850 




44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




— presumably in England — as- 
serted that some statements about 
the feats and attributes of mytho- 
logical and semi-mythological 
characters could probably be ex- 
plained by 'the assumption that 
the hero used Greek Fire, “the 
composition of which is now lost.” 

I replied that I could not judge 
the mythological implications 
(about which I feel somewhat 
doubtful), but that the composi- 
tion of Greek Fire had never been 
lost and that it was certainly 
known in 1850, although the au- 
thor of the book quoted evidently 
had not known where to look for 
it. 

He could, for example, have 
consulted the work “On Greek 
Fire” which Monsieur le profes- 
seur Reynaud and le Capitaine 
Fave had published in Paris in 
1845. He could have found some- 
thing about it in earlier English 
books on gunnery. He could even 
have come across fyr gregeys 
(Greek Fire) and the allied 
wylde-iyr (wildfire) in still older 
English romances. 

A S THESE two names, of 
which one has become pro- 
verbial, indicate, there were two 
types: Greek Fire, which came 
first and was used on land for 
sieges as well as at sea in naval 
engagements, and wildfire, which 
came several centuries later and 
was used exclusively at sea, as 



far as we know, at any rate. 

That this later wildfire or sea- 
fire was promptly called Greek 
Fire, too — especially by people 
who were not Greek themselves 
— produced the first stumbling 
block of confusion. And for a long 
time there actually existed a well- 
kept secret about the sea-fire. The 
existence of such a secret was 
loudly advertised (“secret weap- 
ons” were everybody’s favorite 
even in antiquity) and it is prob- 
ably this much-mentioned fact 
that led to later generalizations 
about a “lost art.” 

As regards the early Greek 
Fire, we have not only general 
and possibly exaggerated de- 
scriptions of its effectiveness but 
even an actual recipe. It was 
written about 350 b. c. by Aeneas 
the Tactician. 

Greek Fire, he said, consists of 
sulphur, pitch, incense, pine-wood 
and tow. No proportions being 
given, it is easy to see that the 
mixture ratio of the ingredients 
was by no means critical. The 
incense probably had some reli- 
gious significance. As for the pine- 
wood, a later commentator 
thought that the term actually 
meant charcoal from pine-wood, 
but personally I can’t see any 
reason for this interpretation. Re- 
sinous pine-wood, probably whit- 
tled into shavings, sounds like a 
very logical companion for sul- 
phur and pitch. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



45 



Aeneas went on to say that 
this mixture was put into egg- 
shaped wooden containers and 
heaved upon the decks of enemy 
ships after ignition. My guess is 
that these containers were pur- 
posely made weak to burst open 
upon striking. 

The next preserved recipe for 
Greek Fire is just seven centuries 
younger than the one just quoted, 
having been written down in 350 
a.d. It can be found in De Re Mili- 
tari by Vegetius. That the seven 
centuries had improved the mix- 
ture by way of much practice 
of “premeditated military arson” 
(to use the circumlocution of 
some German historians for the 
employment of incendiaries) can 
be seen from the list of ingredi- 
ents. 

They were sulphur, rosin, bitu- 
men and naphtha — a mixture 
which would stump even well- 
drilled modern firefighters if they 
had nothing but water at their 
disposal to combat the blaze. 

Actually the Greek Fire of Ve- 
getius was a much better incendi- 
ary than the Greek Fire of the 
much later collection of military 
recipes that goes under the name 
of Liber ignium, or “Fire Book.” 

r ¥' , HE RECIPE for Greek Fire 
is one of the oldest in the 
“Fire Book,” which dates it at 
around 1200 a.d. The ingredients 
listed are the usual sulphur and 

46 



pitch, to which petroleum and 
sarcocolla (a tree gum) were 
added. Further ingredients were 
something called Oil of Gemma, 
tartarum or cream of tartar and 
sal coctus, which is salt produced 
by the evaporation of sea water. 

The sal coctus especially could 
not have done anything for the 
mixture but slow down combus- 
tion and one may be tempted to 
guess at some magical reason for 
its presence. However, the mili- 
tary historian S. J. von Romocki 
has pointed out that there may 
have been a rational reason in- 
volved, rational though mistaken. 

Salt from the sea is essentially 
ordinary salt with a good dose of 
“impurities” and when you add 
salt to a fire the flame is colored 
yellow because of the sodium in 
the salt. Colonel von Romocki had 
reason to believe that the people 
of the eleventh century thought 
that a brighter flame was also a 
hotter flame and since the salt 
brightened the fire, it was thought 
to be a useful addition. It may 
even have been a trade secret for 
a long time. 

The real and useful secret I 
mentioned earlier came into be- 
ing about midway in time be- 
tween the straightforward recipe 
of Vegetius and the far more 
complicated and less effective one 
of the Liber ignium. The secret 
was in the hands of the Christian 
emperors of Constantinople, who 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



confused many a later high-school 
boy by their habit of referring to 
themselves as “Romans.” In the 
printed editions of their own writ- 
ings, it is strange to see somebody 
proclaim in Greek type that “we 
Romans” did this or that. 

But aside from this minor item, 
everything is clear and logical. 
The Chronography of Theo- 
phanes, written 811-815 A. D., 
states in so many words that in 
673 the architect Kallinikos fled 
from Heliopolis in Syria “to the 
Romans” (read: Constantinople) 
and compounded a sea-fire which 
enabled those Romans to burn a 
large number of Moslem ships at 
Cyzicus during the first Moslem 
siege of Constantinople. 

The emperor, Constantine 
(VII) Porphyrogenetos, himself 
corroborated the story by writ- 
ing: “Be it known that under the 
reign of Constantine Pogonatos 
one Kallinikos, who fled from 
Heliopolis to the Romans, pre- 
pared a wet-fire to be discharged 
from siphons, by means of which 
the Romans burned the fleet of 
the Saracens at Cyzicus and 
gained the victory.” 

Since the reign of emperor 
Constantine Pogonatos lasted 
from 668 to 685, the flight of Kal- 
linikos probably did take place 
in 673. This was just one year 
before the beginning of the first 
siege of Constantinople, which 
lasted from 674 to 676. Because 



of this close proximity of the 
dates, it seems likely that Kalli- 
nikos did not make his invention 
after his arrival in Constantinople 
but brought the secret with him. 
It must have been his own and 
not just something known in Heli- 
opolis, because the other side nev- 
er learned it. 

E mperor Constantine 

Porphyrogenetos still kept a 
certain amount of “security” on 
his best weapon, for he advised 
his son as follows: “If any per- 
sons venture to inquire of you 
how this fire is prepared, with- 
stand them, and dismiss them 
with some such answer as this: 
that the secret was revealed by 
an angel to the first Emperor 
Constantine.” 

The first Constantine ruled 
from 323 to 337 and was, of 
course, completely innocent of 
the whole case, but some later 
historians, reading the passage 
inattentively, took it seriously and 
tried to push events back by more 
than three centuries. But as the 
British Lt.-Col. Henry W. L. Hime 
remarked about the seventh Con- 
stantine’s advice to his son: “this 
passage merely proves that the 
Emperor was mendacious and his 
people superstitious.” 

The wet-fire or sea-fire — later 
called wildfire — did serve the 
“Romans” well. It won the naval 
battle which lifted the first siege 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



47 



of Constantinople for them and it 
did the same in the second siege 
in 716 to 718. It repulsed a Rus- 
sian fleet under Igor in 941 and 
won them a decisive victory when 
the Russians tried again in 1043. 

What was this substance? 

That the secret of Kallinikos 
was the incorporation of saltpeter 
into “ordinary” Greek Fire 
seemed an irresistable conclusion 
to quite a number of later writers, 
especially those who had no first- 
hand experience with black gun- 
powder. The reason for their be- 
lief was that one of the original 
sources on sea-fire, the book of 
Princess Anna Komnena, men- 
tions that it burned with much 
smoke and a thunderous noise, 
something that oil vapor can do 
nicely. 

What the “saltpeter writers” 
overlooked or did not understand 
were several simple facts. Emper- 
or Constantine Porphyrogenetos 
as well as Anna Komnena empha- 
size that the sea-fire was projected 
from wooden siphons and we can 
get an idea of what a siphon was 
if we know that this word ordi- 
narily means the apparatus with 
which water was thrown into a 
conflagration. Because of this 
method of projecting it, the sea- 
fire must have been a liquid. It is 
stated furthermore that it burned 
on the surface of the water and if 
you throw slow-burning gunpow- 
der into water you don’t get any 



result worth mentioning — few 
substances are as sensitive to 
moisture as black gunpowder. 

Moreover, if the Byzantine 
“procurement service” — what- 

ever its proper name may have 
been — had bought large quanti- 
ties of an entirely novel substance, 
namely saltpeter, this could not 
have stayed a secret for any 
length of time. It had to be some- 
thing that did not arouse curiosity 
because it was well known and 
used for other purposes, too. And 
it had to be something that would 
sustain combustion in spite of the 
sea water and even cause com- 
bustion with the aid of the water. 

A T ABOUT the time the archi- 
tect Kallinikos left Heliopolis 
to join “the Romans,” an improve- 
ment on the well-known Greek 
Fire had taken place. Pliny the 
Elder, living in Rome in the first 
century A. D., already knew that 
quicklime, when wetted, produces 
a temperature high enough to ig- 
nite easily inflammable sub- 
stances such as naptha. 

Around the year 500, a recipe 
for a quicklime-asphalt mixture 
for military uses in sieges and 
such was actually written down, 
advising the artisan to prepare 
this mixture “in the heat of the 
noonday sun.” Two such recipes 
can still be found in the Liber 
ignium — one names sulphur, 
quicklime and turpentine, the 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



other substitutes oil for the tur- 
pentine — and another book of 
the same period contains a re- 
cipe listing sulphur, quicklime, 
naptha, wax and oil. 

But quicklime could not have 
been the secret of Kallinikos. In 
the first place, it was not a secret 
in his time. In the second place, 
a rather large quantity of quick- 
lime is needed to produce igni- 
tion of an inflammable substance, 
more quicklime than could be 
pumped through a fire hose. 
There is little doubt that the li- 
quid directed at the enemy 
through the “siphon” was a mix- 
ture of petroleum, oil and naph- 
tha, but what ignited it? 

No satisfactory answer to that 
question was given until about 
1912, when the English professor 
W. R. E. Hodgkinson of the Ord- 
nance College in Woolwich got in 
touch with his compatriot Henry 
W. L. Hime after having read the 
latter’s book on the origin of gun- 
powder and ammunition. Profes- 
sor Hodgkinson pointed out that 
there is a substance which could 
ignite such an incendiary liquid 
at sea even when present in only 
small quantities. 

This substance is phosphide of 
calcium. It not only meets the 
technical requirements but also 
what might be called the histori- 
cal requirements. It would have 
been a novel substance at the 
time, known only to the man who 



happened to stumble across it. It 
could have been kept secret be- 
cause rather small quantities were 
required and because no unusual 
materials were needed to make it. 
It can be made of lime, bones and 
urine, all three inconspicuous 
and all three much used by al- 
chemists for their experiments. 

In a manner of speaking, the 
secret of the sea-fire is still a sec- 
ret, for nobody seems to ever 
have written it down. But Pro- 
fessor Hodgkinson’s suggestion 
can be accepted as the solution 
of the problem without any res- 
ervations. Calcium phosphide 
was not “known," but could have 
been found by dabbling in al- 
chemy. 

Quite likely, several people 
came across it at one time or 
another. Kallinikos, however, 
could visualize a use for it when 
he did. 

THE BITE OF THE SHREW 

f 1 1 HE NEXT question, from a 
reader in Canada, is about as 
far removed thematically from 
the earlier question as is possible, 
but there is one connecting link 
— it, too, is prompted by a state- 
ment in an old book. 

An explorer, returning from Af- 
rica, wrote that he had been as- 
sured by Ethiopians as well as 
white settlers that the claws of 
lions were poisonous, for wounds

caused by such claws tended to 
“inflame” and to be very slow- 
healing, often breaking open 
again months later. 

My correspondent concluded 
correctly that the idea — accept- 
ing the statement itself as being 
substantially true — was based on 
a confusion between poison and 
infection. But he wanted to know 
whether any vertebrates other 
than snakes and the two versions 
of the Gila monster actually car- 
ry poison. 

The answer is not as simple as 
it might look at first glance. 
Among the amphibians, for ex- 
ample, there is no known case of 
poison glands connected with hol- 
low or grooved fangs, which is 
what one usually thinks of after 
a mention of venomous snakes. 
But various toads produce a sub- 
stance in skin glands that can 
raise blisters on human skin. 
There is no real danger and sus- 
ceptibility seems to vary within 
fantastic limits, most people hav- 
ing very little of it. But strictly 
speaking, it is a poison. 

And one South American tree 
frog, beautifully sheathed in shiny 
green and golden-yellow skin, 
does produce a poison in its skin 
glands which makes it dangerous 
to the touch. The South American 
Indians actually use the frog’s 
skin exudation to poison their ar- 
rows. 

In the classes above the am- 



phibians and reptiles, examples of 
poison become so rare that they 
are surprises rather than ex- 
amples and even a zoologist may 
not think at once of the one I 
have chiefly in mind. True, there 
is no venomous bird, although 
somebody once spoke of “the 
hawk’s venomous glare,” but it is 
different with the mammals. One 
whole group of them has glands 
producing a strongly venomous 
substance, even though this is not 
possibly a weapon. 

T AM REFERRING to the 

members of the lowest subclass 
of the mammals, the monotremes 
of Australia and New Guinea, bet- 
ter known as platypus and echid- 
na. 

The males of these animals 
carry on their hind legs a spur, 
rather similar in appearance and 
position to the spur of a rooster. 
It is smaller in size and, unlike 
the rooster’s spur, it is movable. 
And it has a fine canal, so narrow 
that a human hair can be passed 
through it, while a horse hair is 
too thick. This canal is connected 
with the duct of a gland. And ever 
since platypus has been known — 
which is since 1797 — it was said 
that the spur is poisonous. 

One very precise report was 
written in 1816 by Sir John Jami- 
son. A man, he reported, had 
picked up a male platypus and 
the animal, kicking its legs, had 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



jabbed its spur into his hand. The 
victim “in spite of immediate med" 
ical treatment exhibited all the 
symptoms of a person bitten by a 
venomous snake. The man was 
obliged to keep to his bed for 
several days, and did not recover 
the use of his hand for nine 
weeks.” 

This is the first definite case on 
record, but it did not remain the 
only one. In the course of time, 
quite a number of people have 
been injured by the spur of a 
male platypus and in every case 
the symptoms resembled snake 
bite, though recovery, as a rule, 
took less than a week. No fatal 
case is known, but smaller ani- 
mals, like rabbits, died very soon 
after a platypus spur was forced 
through their skins. 

I said earlier that this cannot 
possibly be a weapon because 
only the males are equipped with 
the spur. It must somehow be sex- 
linked, but so far very little about 
its “natural use” — if this is the 
proper term — is known. The two 
most obvious theories that have 
found their way into print are 
that (A) the spurs are the equiva- 
lent of antlers and used by the 
males on each other in fighting 
for the females or (B) the spurs 
are used by the males on the fe- 
males to inject them with what 
to a platypus is an aphrodisiac. 
Maybe — but to anybody else, it 
is poison. 



Another example of a poison 
gland in a mammal has become 
known only very recently. It was 
announced for the first time dur- 
ing the last week of 1954 of the 
First International Conference on 
Animal Venoms by Dr. Oliver P. 
Pearson of the University of Cali- 
fornia. 

The poison bearer is the short- 
tailed shrew Blarina brevicauda. 
The poison glands seem to be “in 
a distinctive, granule-filled seg- 
ment” of the tissue around the 
jaws. “Injection of minute quan- 
tities of saline extract of these 
glands produces dramatic effects 
on respiration, pulse and blood 
pressure” in experimental animals. 
It kills mice, which the shrew 
eats. It has been found in this 
species of shrew only. 

And that is all that is known 
so far. 

LEAP YEARS ON MARS 

A nother Canadian read- 
er, an officer of the armed 
forces, came up with a triple 
question, all concerning our neigh- 
bor Mars. His third and last ques- 
tion is the easiest to answer — 
where should he try to be sta- 
tioned in 1956, when Mars comes 
close, so he can get a good view? 

Well, not in Canada and if an 
assignment of that sort can be 
wangled, south of even the U. S. 
The second question was just

how close Mars would be during 
the 1956 opposition and how this 
opposition compares to a few of 
the preceding oppositions. The 
answer is that the 1956 opposition 
comes close to what is astronomi- 
cally possible; it is a pity that we 
can’t observe it from a space sta- 
tion outside the Earth’s atmos- 
phere. 

The next really good opposi- 
tion will take place in August, 
1971, and there should be a space 
station by then. There will be a 
fine one in 2003, but with some 
luck we’ll then no longer need 
oppositions to observe the planet; 
very likely one will be able to call 
up the Lacus Solis station and in- 
quire about the local weather 
forecast. 

As for comparisons with other 
recent oppositions, this is how 
things worked out:

1943, Dec. 5

1948, Feb. 18

60.700.000 

52.400.000 

40.300.000 

35.400.000 



The first question in the letter 
was whether somebody had ever 
devised a calendar for Mars. To 
my knowledge, it has been done 
at least three times. The earliest 
I know of came from the facile 
pen of the French astronomer Ca- 



mille Flammarion. Some ten or 
twelve years ago, Dr. Robert S. 
Richardson presented several ver- 
sions of a Martian calendar and 
last year Dr. I. M. Levitt pub- 
lished another one, modeled, no 
doubt, on the proposed World 
Calendar for Earth. 

The sad fact is that Mars, just 
fike Earth, does not complete one 
revolution around the Sun in a 
fractionless number of its days. 
The length of the Martian year is 
668 and six-tenths Martian days. 
This produces something like the 
leap-year cycle of the terrestrial 
calendar, except that there are 
more leap years than normal 
years on Mars, if you define a 
leap year as a year that has one 
more day than a normal year. 

In Dr. Levitt’s calendar, the 
Martian year is divided into four 
equal quarters, running 56, 56, 55. 
This means that the first two 
months of the quarter, say Janu- 
ary and February, have 56 days 
each, while March has 55. The 
same holds true for each quarter 
in turn. The total per year makes 
668 days. To take care of the 
extra 6/ 10th of a day per year, 
the calendar has to run in five- 
year cycles. 

In each cycle, you have two 
normal years of 668 days and 
three leap years of 669 days. In 
those leap years, December would 
have 56 days, too. Now twice 668 
plus three times 669 adds up to 



52 



GA1AXY SCIENCE FICTION 



3343 days. The figure 668.6 mul- 
tiplied by five also produces 3343 
days. Trouble is that the true fig- 
ure is not 668.6 but 668.59905, so 
that each calendar year comes out 
just a trifle too long. 

However, the problem can be 
simply solved, since the tiny dif- 
ference adds up to just one day 
per millenium. Once every millen- 
ium, a day has to be dropped, 
which means that in one five-year 
cycle per millenium, there will be 
three normal years and two leap 
years. 

LAST WORD ON THE 
"MOUNTAIN BOOMER" 

T? VERY ONCE in a while, I 
have the pleasing experience 
of receiving a letter which tells 
me something instead of asking 
questions. Such a letter came 
from an officer of the U. S. Navy, 
who wrote: 

“As a herpetologist and Texan, 
I can answer your question as to 
the use of Mountain Boomer for 
lizards of the genus Crotaphytus. 
Oddly enough, its origin is tied up 
with the strange life history of the 
frog Eleuthrodactylus latrans 
(family Leptodactylidae) . This 
is a fairly common but seldom 
seen frog of the southwestern 
United States. Unlike most other 
frogs and toads, the frogs of this 
genus do not require water for 
their larval development. 



“The eggs are laid in the moist 
earth under large boulders and 
slabs of limestone. Here the tad- 
poles develop and undergo meta- 
morphosis before hatching. Tiny 
frogs emerge directly from the 
eggs. The mating call of an adult 
male can be heard over a half a 
mile, and unlike other frogs they 
call throughout the day as well as 
night. Now with the underside of 
boulders the favorite habitat of 
Eleuthrodactylus latrans and the 
upper surfaces the favorite sun- 
ning places of Crotaphytus col- 
laris (and other large lizards), it 
often happens that the loud boom 
of the frog is attributed to the 
basking lizard. 

“I first heard,” my correspond- 
ent continued, “the Collared Liz- 
ard called Mountain Boomer a 
number of years ago while on a 
field trip near San Marcos, Texas. 
Upon asking why such a strange 
name, I was assured that the liz- 
ard had a mighty voice and 
boomed both day and night. My 
informant then described perfect- 
ly the voice of Eleuthrodactylus 
latrans ... Of course, almost all 
lizards are mute, with a few ex- 
ceptions, like some members of 
the family Geckonidae and the 
Jamaican lizard Anolis grahami, 
which emit a faint squeak.” 

Thank you, Mr. R. E. We’ll 
now put the Mountain Boomer to 
rest as far as this column is con- 
cerned. — WILLY LEY

££ TUNIOR!” bellowed Pater. 

J “Junior!” squeaked Mater, a 
quavering echo. 

“Strayed off again — the young 
idiot! If he’s playing in the shal- 
lows, with this tide going out . .” 
Pater let the sentence hang black- 
ly. He leaned upslope as far as 
he could stretch, angrily scan- 
ning the shoreward reaches where 
light filtered more brightly down 
through the murky water, where 
the sea-surface glinted like bits 
of broken mirror. 



No sign of Junior. 

Mater was peering fearfully 
in the other direction, toward 
where, as daylight faded, the slope 
of the coastal shelf was fast los- 
ing itself in green profundity. 
Out there, out of sight at this 
hour, the reef that loomed shel- 
tering above them fell away in 
an abrupt cliffhead, and the abyss 
began. 

“Oh, oh,” sobbed Mater. “He’s 
lost. He’s swum into the abyss 
and been eaten by a sea monster.”

Her slender stem rippled and 
swayed on its base and her deli- 
cate crown of pinkish tentacles 
trailed disheveled in the pull of 
the ebbtide. 

“Pish, my dear!” said Pater. 
“There are no sea monsters. At 
worst,” he consoled her stoutly, 
“Junior may have been trapped 
in a tidepool.” 

“Oh, oh,” gulped Mater. “He’ll 
be eaten by a land monster.” 

“There ARE no land mon- 
sters!” snorted Pater. He straight- 
ened his stalk so abruptly that 
the stone to which he and Mater 
were conjugally attached creaked 
under them. “How often must I 
assure you, my dear, that WE 
are the highest form of life?” 
(And, as for his world and geo- 
logic epoch, he was quite right.) 

“Oh, oh,” gasped Mater. 

Her spouse gave her up. “JUN- 
IOR!” he roared in a voice that 
loosened the coral along the reef. 

T> OUND about, the couple’s be- 
reavement had begun at- 
tracting attention. In the thicken- 
ing dusk, tentacles paused from 
winnowing the sea for their 
owners’ suppers, stalked heads 
turned curiously here and there 
in the colony. Not far away, 
a threesome of maiden aunts, 
rooted en brosse to a single sub- 
stantial boulder, twittered con- 
dolences and watched Mater 
avidly.

“Discipline!” growled Pater. 
“That’s what he needs! Just wait 
till I — ” 

“Now, dear — ” began Mater 
shakily. 

“Hi, folks!” piped Junior from 
overhead. 

His parents swiveled as if on a 
single stalk. Their offspring was 
floating a few fathoms above 
them, paddling lazily against the 
ebb; plainly he had just swum 
from some crevice in the reef 
nearby. In one pair of dangling 
tentacles he absently hugged a 
roundish stone, worn sensuously 
smooth by pounding surf. 

“WHERE HAVE YOU 
BEEN?” 

“Nowhere,” said Junior inno- 
cently. “Just playing hide-and-go- 
sink with the squids.” 

“With the other polyps,” Mater 
corrected him primly. She detest- 
ed slang. 

Pater was eyeing Junior with 
ominous calm. “And where,” he 
asked, “did you get that stone?” 

Junior contracted guiltily. The 
surfstone slipped from his ten- 
tacles and plumped to the sea- 
floor in a flurry of sand. He edged 
away, stammering, “Well, I guess 
maybe ... I might have gone a 
little ways toward the beach . .” 

“You guess! When I was a 
polyp,” said Pater, “the small fry 
obeyed their elders, and no guess 
about it!” 

“Now, dear — ” said Mater.

“And no spawn of mine,” Pater 
warmed to his lecture, “is going 
to flout my words! Junior — 
COME HERE!” 

Junior paddled cautiously 
around the homesite, just out of 
tentacle-reach. He said in a small 
voice, “I won’t.” 

“DID YOU HEAR ME?” 
“Yes,” admitted Junior. 

The neighbors stared. The 
three maiden aunts clutched one 
another with muted shrieks, sa- 
voring beforehand the language 
Pater would now use. 

But Pater said “Ulp!” — no 
more. 

“Now, dear,” put in Mater 
quickly. “We must be patient. 
You know all children go through 
larval stages.” 

“When I was a polyp . .” Pater 
began rustily. He coughed out an 
accidentally inhaled crustacean, 
and started over: “No spawn of 
mine . ” Trailing off, he only 
glared, then roared abruptly, 
“SPRAT!” 

“I won’t!” said Junior reflex- 
ively and backpaddled into the 
coral shadows of the reef. 

“That wallop,” seethed Pater, 
“wants a good polyping. I mean 
. .” He glowered suspiciously at 
Mater and the neighbors. 

“Dear,” soothed Mater, “did- 
n’t you notice?” 

“Of course, I . Notice what?” 
“What Junior was doing . 
carrying a stone. I don’t suppose 

58 



he understands why, just yet, 
but . .” 

“A stone? Ah, uh, to be sure, 
a stone. Why, my dear, do you 
realize what this means?” 

"OATER was once more occu- 
pied with improving Mater’s 
mind. It was a long job, without 
foreseeable end — especially since 
he and his helpmeet were both 
firmly rooted for life to the same 
tastefully decorated homesite 
(garnished by Pater himself 
with colored pebbles, shells, ur- 
chins and bits of coral in the 
rather rococo style which had pre- 
vailed during Pater’s courting 
days as a free-swimming polyp). 

“Intelligence, my dear,” pro- 
nounced Pater, “is quite incom- 
patible with motility. Just think 
— how could ideas congeal in a 
brain shuttled hither and yon, 
bombarded with ever-changing 
sense-impressions? Look at the 
lower species, which swim about 
all their lives, incapable of taking 
root or thought! True Intelli- 
gence, my dear — as distinguish- 
ed from Instinct, of course — pre- 
supposes the fixed viewpoint!” He 
paused. 

Mater murmured, “Yes, dear,” 
as she always did obediently at 
this point. 

Junior undulated past, swim- 
ming toward the abyss. He moved 
a bit heavily now; it was growing 
hard for him to keep his maturely 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thickening afterbody in a hori- 
zontal posture. 

“Just look at the young of our 
own kind,” said Pater. “Scatter- 
brained larvae, wandering greed- 
ily about in search of new stimuli. 
But, praise be, they mature at 
last into sensible sessile adults. 
While yet the unformed intellect 
rebels against the ending of care- 
free polyphood, Instinct, the wis- 
dom of Nature, instructs them to 
prepare for the great change!” 

He nodded wisely as Junior 
came gliding back out of the 
gloom of deep water. Junior’s ten- 
tacles clutched an irregular basalt 
fragment which he must have 
picked up down the rubble-strewn 
slope. As he paddled slowly along 
the rim of the reef, the adult an- 
thozoans located directly below 
looked up and hissed irritable 
warnings. 

He was swimming a bit more 
easily now and, if Pater had not 
been a firm believer in Instinct, 
he might have been reminded of 
the grossly materialistic theory, 
propounded by some iconoclast, 
according to which a maturing 
polyp’s tendency to grapple ob- 
jects was merely a matter of tak- 
ing on ballast. 

“See!” declared Pater trium- 
phantly. “I don’t suppose he un- 
derstands why, just yet . but 
Instinct urges him infallibly to 
assemble the materials for his fu- 
ture homesite.”

J UNIOR let the rock fragment 
fall, and began plucking rest- 
lessly at a coral outcropping. 

“Dear,” said Mater, “don’t you 
think you ought to tell him . .?” 
“Ahem!” said Pater. “The wis- 
dom of Instinct — ” 

“As you’ve always said, a polyp 
needs a parent’s guidance,” re- 
marked Mater. 

“Ahem!” repeated Pater. He 
straightened his stalk, and bel- 
lowed authoritatively, “JUNIOR! 
Come here!” 

The prodigal polyp swam war- 
ily close. “Yes, Pater?” 

“Junior,” said his parent sol- 
emnly, “now that you are about 
to grow down, it behooves you to 
know certain facts.” 

Mater blushed a delicate lav- 
ender and turned away on her 
side of the rock. 

“Very soon now,” said Pater, 
“you will begin feeling an irresis- 
tible urge ... to sink to the bot- 
tom, to take root there in some 
sheltered location which will be 
your lifetime site. Perhaps you 
even have an understanding al- 
ready with some . ah . 
charming young polyp of the op- 
posite gender, whom you would 
invite to' share your homesite. Or, 
if not, you should take all the 
more pains to make that site as 
attractive as possible, in order 
that such a one may decide to 
grace it with — ” 

“Uh-huh,” said Junior under- 

59 



standingly. “That’s what the fel- 
lows mean when they say any of 
’em’ll fall for a few high-class 
rocks.” 

Pater marshaled his thoughts 
again. “Well, quite apart from 
such material considerations as 
selecting the right rocks, these 
are certain . ah . matters 
we do not ordinarily discuss.” 
Mater blushed a more pro- 
nounced lavender. The three 
maiden aunts, rooted to their 
boulder within easy earshot of 
Pater’s carrying voice, put up a 
respectable pretense of searching 
one another for nonexistent water- 
fleas. 

“No doubt,” said Pater, “in the 
course of your harum-scarum ad- 
venturings as a normal polyp 
among polyps, you’ve noticed the 
ways in which the lower orders 
reproduce themselves; the activi- 
ties of the fishes, the Crustacea, 
the marine worms will not have 
escaped your attention.” 

“Uh-huh,” said Junior, treading 
water. 

will have observed that 
A among these there takes 
place a good deal of . ah . 
maneuvering for position. But 
among intelligent, firmly rooted 
beings like ourselves, matters are, 
of course, on a less crude and di- 
rect plane. What among lesser 
creatures is a question of tactics 
belongs, for us, to the realm of 

60 



strategy.” Pater’s tone grew con- 
fiding. “Now, Junior, once you’re 
settled you’ll realize the impor- 
tance of being easy in your mind 
about your offspring’s parentage. 
Remember, a niche in brine saves 
trying. Nothing like choosing your 
location well in the first place. 
Study the currents around your 
prospective site — particularly 
their direction and force at such 
crucial times as flood-tide. Try to 
make sure you and your future 
mate won’t be too close down-cur- 
rent from anybody else’s site, 
since in a case like that accidents 
can happen. You understand, 
Junior?” 

“Uh-huh,” acknowledged Jun- 
ior. “That’s what the fellows 
mean when they say don’t let 
anybody get the drop on you.” 

“Well!” said Pater in flat dis- 
approval. 

“But it all seems sort of silly,” 
said Junior stubbornly. “I’d rather 
just keep moving around, and 
not have to do all that figuring. 
And the ocean’s full of things I 
haven’t seen yet. I don’t want to 
grow down!” 

Mater paled with shock. Pater 
gave his spawn a scalding, scan- 
dalized look. “You’ll learn! You 
can’t beat Biology,” he said thick- 
ly, creditably keeping his voice 
down. “Junior, you may go!” 

Junior bobbled off, and Pater 
admonished Mater sternly, “We 
must have patience, my dear! All 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



children pass through these larval 
stages . 

“Yes, dear,” sighed Mater. 

A T LONG last, Junior seemed 
to have resigned himself to 
making the best of it. 

With considerable exertions, 
hampered by his increasing bot- 
tom-heaviness, he was fetching 
loads of stones, seaweed and other 
debris to a spot downslope, and 
there laboring over what pro- 
mised to be a fairly ambitious 
cairn. Judging by what they could 
see of it, his homesite might even 
prove a credit to the colony (so 
went Pater’s thoughts) and at- 
tract a mate who would be a 
good catch (thus Mater mused). 

Junior was still to be seen at 
times along the reef in company 
with his free-swimming friends 
among the other polyps, at some 
of whom his parents had always 
looked askance, fearing they were 
by no means well-bred. In fact, 
there was strong suspicion that 
some of them — waifs from the 
disreputable Shallows district in 
the hazardous reaches just below 
the tide-mark — had never been 
bred at all, but were products of 
budding, a practice frowned on in 
polite society. 

However, Junior’s appearance 
and rate of locomotion made it 
clear he would soon be done with 
juvenile follies. As Pater repeated 
with satisfaction — you can’t beat 



Biology; as one becomes more 
and more bottle-shaped, the ro- 
mantic illusions of youth must 
inevitably perish. 

“I always knew there was 
sound stuff in the youngster,” de- 
clared Pater expansively. 

“At least he won’t be able to 
go around with those ragamuffins 
much longer,” breathed Mater 
thankfully. 

“What does the young fool 
think he’s doing, fiddling round 
with soapstone?” grumbled Pater, 
peering critically through the 
green to try to make out the de- 
tails of Junior’s building. “Doesn’t 
he know it’s apt to slip its place 
in a year or two?” 

“Look, dear,” hissed Mater 
acidly, “isn’t that the little polyp 
who was so rude once? ... I wish 
she wouldn’t keep watching Jun- 
ior like that. Our northwest neigh- 
bor heard positively that she’s 
the child of an only parent!” 
“Never mind.” Pater turned to 
reassure her. “Once Junior is pro- 
perly rooted, his self-respect will 
cause him to keep riffraff at a 
distance. It’s a matter of Psychol- 
ogy, my dear; the vertical posi- 
tion makes all the difference in 
one’s thinking.” 

HE great day arrived. 
Laboriously Junior put a few 
finishing touches to his construc- 
tion — which, so far as could be 
seen from a distance, had turned 




JUNIOR 



61 



out decent-looking enough, 
though it was rather questionably 
original in design: lower and 

flatter than was customary. 

With one more look at his 
handiwork, Junior turned bottom- 
end-down and sank wearily onto 
the finished site. After a minute, 
he paddled experimentally, but 
flailing tentacles failed to lift him. 
He was already rooted, and grow- 
ing more solidly so by the mo- 
ment. ~ 

“Congratulations!” cried the 
neighbors. Pater and Mater 
bowed this way and that in ac- 
knowledgment. Mater waved a 
condescending tentacle to the 
three maiden aunts. 

“I told you so!” said Pater tri- 
umphantly. 

“Yes, dear . .” said Mater 
meekly. 

Suddenly there were outcries 
of alarm from the dwellers down- 
reef. A wave of dismay swept 
audibly through all the nearer 
part of the colony. Pater and Ma- 
ter looked around, and froze. 

Junior had begun paddling 
again, but this time in a most 
peculiar manner — with a rotary 
twist and sidewise scoop which 
looked awkward, but which he 
performed so deftly that he must 
have practiced it. Fixed upright 
as he was now on the .platform 
he had built, he looked for all the 
world as if he were trying to swim 
sidewise. 

62 



“He’s gone mad!” squeaked 
Mater. 

“I . .” gulped Pater, “I’m afraid 
not.” 

At least, they saw, there was 
method in Junior’s actions. He 
went on paddling in the same 
fashion and now he, and his plat- 
form with him, were farther away 
than they had been, and growing 
more remote as they stared. 

T)ARTS of the homesite that 
was not a homesite revolved 
in some way incomprehensible to 
eyes that had never seen the like. 
And the whole affair trundled 
along, rocking at bumps in the 
sandy bottom, and squeaking 
painfully; nevertheless, it moved. 

The polyps watching from the 
reef swam out and frolicked after 
Junior, watching his contrivance 
go and chattering eager questions, 
while their parents- bawled at 
them to keep away from that. 

The three maiden aunts 
shrieked faintly and swooned in 
one another’s tentacles. The 
colony was shaken as it had not 
been since the tidal wave. 

“COME BACK!” thundered 
Pater. “You CAN’T do that!” 
“Come back!” shrilled Mater. 
“You can’t do that!” 

“Come back!” gabbled the 
neighbors. “You can’t do that!” 
But Junior was past listening 
to reason. Junior was on wheels.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the 

Gravity 

Business 

By JAMES E. GUNN 

This little alien beggar could dictate his own 
terms, but how could he— and how could 
anyone find out what those terms might be? 



Illustrated by ASHMAN 



T HE FLIVVER descended 
vertically toward the green 
planet circling the old, 
orange sun. 

It was a spaceship, but not the 



kind men had once dreamed 
about. The flivver was shaped 
like a crude bullet, blunt at one 
end of a fat cylinder and tapering 
abruptly to a point at the other. 



THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



63 




It had been slapped together out 
of sheet metal and insulation 
board, and it sold, fully equipped, 
for S 15,730. It didn’t behave like 
a spaceship, either. 



As it hurtled down, its speed 
increased with dramatic swift- 
ness. Then, at the last instant 
before impact, it stopped. Just 
like that. 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



A moment later, it thumped a 
last few inches into the ankle- 
deep grass and knee-high white 
flowers of the meadow. It was a 
shock of a jar that made the 
sheet-metal walls boom like 
thunder machines. The flivver 
rocked unsteadily on its flat 
stern before it decided to stay 
upright. 

Then all was quiet — outside. 

Inside the big, central cabin, 
Grampa waved his pircuit irately 
in the air. “Now look what you 
made me do! Just when I had 
the blamed thing practically 
whipped, too!” 

Grampa was a white-haired 90- 
year-old who could still go a fast 
round or two with a man (or wo- 
man) half his age, but he had a 
habit of lapsing into tantrum 
when he got annoyed. 

“Now, Grampa,” Fred soothed, 
but his face was concerned. Fred, 
once called Young Fred, was 
Grampa’s only son. He was six- 
ty and his hair had begun to 
gray at the temples. “That land- 
ing was pretty rough, Junior.” 

J UNIOR WAS Fred’s only son. 

Because he was thirty-five and 
capable of exercising adult judg- 
ment and because he had the 
youngest adult reflexes, he sat in 
the pilot’s chair, the control stick 
between his knees, his thumb still 
over the Off-On button on top. 
“I know it, Fred,” he said, frown- 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



ing. “This world fooled me. It has 
a diameter less than that of Mer- 
cury and yet a gravitational pull 
as great as Earth.” 

Grampa started to say some- 
thing, but an 8-year-old boy 
looked up from the navigator’s 
table beside the big computer and 
said, “Well, gosh, Junior, that’s 
why we picked this planet. We 
fed all the orbital data into Aba- 
cus, and Abacus said that orbital 
perturbations indicated that the 
second planet was unusually 
heavy for its size. Then Fred 
said, ‘That looks like heavy me- 
tals’, and you said, ‘Maybe urani- 
um — ’ ” 

“That’s enough, Four,” Junior 
interrupted. “Never mind what I 
said.” 

Those were the Peppergrass 
men, four generations of them, 
looking remarkably alike, al- 
though some vital element 
seemed to have dwindled until 
Four looked pale and thin-faced 
and wizened. 

“And, Four,” Reba said auto- 
matically, “don’t call your father 
‘Junior.’ It sounds disrespectful.” 

Reba was Four’s mother and 
Junior’s wife. On her own, she 
was a red-haired beauty with the 
loveliest figure this side of An- 
tares. That Junior had won her 
was, to Grampa, the most hope- 
ful thing he had ever noticed 
about the boy. 

“But everybody calls Junior 

65 



‘Junior,’” Four complained. “Be- 
sides, Fred is Junior’s father and 
Junior calls him ‘Fred.’” 

“That’s different,” Reba said. 

Grampa was still waving his 
puzzle circuit indignantly. “See!” 
The pircuit was a flat box equip- 
ped with pushbuttons and thir- 
teen slender openings in the top. 
One of the openings was lighted. 
“That landing made me push the 
wrong button and the dad-blasted 
thing beat me again.” 

“Stop picking on Junior,” Joyce 
said sharply. She was Junior’s 
mother and Fred’s wife, still slim 
and handsome as she approached 
sixty, but somehow ice water had 
replaced the warm blood in her 
veins. “I’m sure he did the best 
he could.” 

“Anybody talks about gravita- 
tional pull,” Grampa said, snort- 
ing, “deserves anything anybody 
could say about him. There’s no 
such thing, Junior. You ought to 
know by now that gravitation is 
the effect of the curving of space- 
time around matter. Einstein 
proved that two hundred years 
ago.” 

“Go back to your games, Gram- 
pa,” Fred said impatiently. “We’- 
ve got work to do.” 

r RAMPA KNITTED his 
bushy, white eyebrows and 
petulantly pushed the last but- 
ton on his pircuit. The last light 
went out. “You’ve got work to 

66 



do, have you? Whose flivver do 
you think this is, anyhow?” 

“It belongs to all of us,” Four 
said shrilly. “You gave us all a 
sixth share.” 

“That’s right, Four,” Grampa 
muttered, “so I did. But whose 
money bought it?” 

“You bought it, Grampa,” Fred 
said. 

“That’s right! And who in- 
vented the gravity polarizer and 
the space flivver? Eh? Who made 
possible this gallivanting all over 
space?” 

“You, Grampa,” Fred said. 

“You bet! And who made one 
hundred million dollars out of it 
that the rest of you vultures are 
just hanging around to gobble up 
when I die?” 

“And who spent it all trying to 
invent perpetual motion ma- 
chines and longevity pills,” Joyce 
said bitterly, “and fixed it so 
we’d have to go searching for 
uranium and habitable worlds all 
through this deadly galaxy? You, 
Grampa!” 

“Well, now,” Grampa protested, 
“I got a little put away yet. You’ll 
be sorry when I’m dead and gone.” 

“You’re never going to die, 
Grampa,” Joyce said harshly. 
“Just before we left, you bought 
a hundred-year contract with that 
Life-Begins-At-Ninety longevity 
company.” 

“Well, now,” said Grampa, 
blinking, “how’d you find out 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



about that? Well, now!” In con- 
fusion, he turned back to the 
pircuit and jabbed a button. 
Thirteen slim lights sprang on. 
“I’ll get you this time!” 

Four stretched and stood up. 
He looked curiously into the cor- 
ner by the computer where Gram- 
pa’s chair stood. “You brought 
that pircuit from Earth, didn’t 
you? What’s the game?” 

Grampa looked up, obviously 
relieved to drop his act of in- 
tense concentration. “I’ll tell you, 
boy. You play against the pircuit, 
taking turns, and you can put 
out one, two or three lights. The 
player who makes the other one 
turn out the last light is the win- 
ner.” 

“That’s simple,” Four said with- 
out hesitation. “The winning stra- 
tegy is to — ” 

“Don’t be a kibitzer!” Grampa 
snapped. “When I need help, I’ll 
ask for it. No dad-blamed ma- 
chine is gonna outthink Grampa!” 
He snorted indignantly. 

T^OUR SHRUGGED his nar- 
row shoulders and wandered 
to the view screen. Within it was 
the green horizon, curving notice- 
ably. Four angled the picture in 
toward the ship, sweeping through 
green, peaceful woodland and 
plain and blue lake until he stared 
down into the meadow at the fliv- 
ver’s stern. 

“Look!” he said suddenly. “This 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



planet not only has flora — it has 
fauna.” He rushed to the air lock. 

“Four!” Reba called out warn- 
ingly. 

“It’s all right, Reba,” Four as- 
sured her. “The air is within 
one per cent of Earth-normal and 
the bio-analyzer can find no mi- 
cro-organisms viable within the 
Terran spectrum.” 

“What about macro-organisms 
— ” Reba began, but the boy was 
gone already. Reba’s face was 
troubled. “That boy!” she said to 
Junior. “Sometimes I think we’ve 
made a terrible mistake with him. 
He should have friends, play- 
mates. He’s more like a little old 
man than a boy.” 

But Junior nodded meaning- 
fully at Fred and disappeared 
into the chart room. Fred fol- 
lowed casually. Then, as the door 
slid shut behind him, he asked 
impatiently. “Well, what’s all the 
mystery?” 

“No use bothering the others 
yet,” Junior said, his face puzzled. 
“You see, I didn’t let the flivver 
drop those last few inches. The 
polarizer quit.” 

“Quit!” 

“That’s not the worst. I tried to 
take it up again. The flivver — it 
won’t budge!” 

T HE THING was a featureless 
blob, a two-foot sphere of 
raspberry gelatin, but it was alive. 
It rocked back and forth in front 

67 



of Four. It opened a raspberry- 
color pseudo-mouth and said 
plaintively, “Fweep? Fweep?” 
Joyce drew her chair farther 
back toward the wall, revulsion 
on her face. “Four! Get that nasty 
thing out of here!” 

“You mean Fweep?” Four 
asked in astonishment. 

“I mean that thing, whatever 
you call it.” Joyce fluttered her 
hand impatiently. “Get it out!” 
Four’s eyes widened farther. 
“But Fweep’s my friend.” 

“Nonsense!” Joyce said sharply. 
“Earthmen don’t make friends 
with aliens. And that’s nothing but 
a — a blob!” 

“Fweep?” queried the raspber- 
ry lips. “Fweep?” 

“If it’s Four’s friend,” Reba 
said firmly, “it can stay. If you 
don’t like to be around it, Gram- 
my, you can always go to your 
own room.” 

Joyce stood up indignantly. 
“Well! And don’t call me ‘Gram- 
my!’ It makes me sound as old 
as that old goat over there!” She 
glared malignantly at Grampa. 
“If you’d rather have that blob 
than me — well!” She swept grand- 
ly out of the central cabin and 
into one of the private rooms that 
opened out from it. 

“Fweep?” asked the blob. 
“Sure,” Four said. “Go ahead, 
fweep — I mean sweep.” 

Swiftly the sphere rolled across 
the floor. Behind it was left a nar- 

68 



row path of sparkling clean tile. 

Grampa glanced warily at Joy- 
ce’s door to make sure it was 
completely closed and then 
cocked a white eyebrow at Reba. 
“Good for you, Reba!” he said ad- 
miringly. “For forty years now, 
I’ve wanted to do that. Never had 
the nerve.” 

“Why, thanks, Grampa,” Reba 
said, surprised. 

“I like you, gal. Never forget 
it.” 

“I like you, too, Grampa. If 
you’d been a few years younger, 
Junior would have had competi- 
tion!” 

“You bet he would!” Grampa 
leaned back and cackled. Then he 
leaned over confidentially toward 
Reba and whispered, “Beats me 
why you ever married a jerk like 
Junior, anyhow.” 

Reba looked thoughtfully to- 
ward the airlock door. “Maybe I 
saw something in him nobody 
else saw, the man he might be- 
come. He’s been submerged in 
this family too long; he’s still a 
child to all of you and to himself, 
too.” Reba smiled at Grampa 
brilliantly. “And maybe I thought 
he might grow into a man like his 
grandfather.” 

G RAMPA TURNED red and 
looked quickly toward Four. 
The boy was staring intently at 
Fweep. “What you doing, Four?” 
“Trying to figure out what 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Fweep does with the sweepings,” 
Four said absently. “The outer 
inch or two of his body gets 
cloudy and then slowly clears. 
I think I’ll try him with a big- 
ger particle.” 

“That’s the idea, Four. You’ll 
be a Peppergrass yet. How about 
building me a pircuit?” 

“You get the other one figured 
out?” 

“It was easy,” Grampa said 
breezily, “once you understood 
the principle. The player who 
moved second could always win 
if he used the right strategy. Di- 
viding the thirteen lights into 
three sections of four each — ” 

“That’s right,” Four agreed. “I 
can make you a new one by can- 
nibalizing the other pircuit, but 
I’ll need a few extra parts.” 

Grampa pushed the wall beside 
his chair and a drawer slid out of 
it. 

Inside were row after row of 
nipple-topped, flat-sided, flexible 
free-fall bottles and a battered 
cigar box. “Thought you’d say 
that,” he said, picking out the 
box. “Help yourself.” With the 
other hand, he lifted out one of 
the bottles and took a long drag 
on it. “Ahhh!” he sighed, wiped 
his mouth with the back of his 
hand, and carefully put the bot- 
tle away. 

“What is that stuff you drink, 
Grampa?” Four asked. 

“Tonic, boy. Keeps me young 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



and frisky. Now about that pir- 
cuit — ” 

» “Did you ever work on Niccolo 
Tartaglia’s puzzle about the three 
lovely brides, the three jealous 
husbands, the river and the twcA 
passenger rowboat?” 

“Yep,” Grampa said. “Too 
easy.” 

Four thought a moment. 
“There’s a modern variation with 
three missionaries and three can- 
nibals. Same river, same rowboat 
and only one of the cannibals can 
row. If the cannibals outnumber 
the missionaries — ” 

“Sounds good, boy,” Grampa 
said eagerly. “Whip it up for me.” 
“Okay, Grampa.” Four looked 
at Fweep again. The translucent 
sphere had paused at Grampa’s 
feet. 

Grampa reached down to pat 
it. For an instant, his hand disap- 
peared into Fweep, and then the 
alien creature rolled away. This 
time its path seemed crooked. 

Its gelatinous form jiggled. 
“Hid” it said. 

A S IF IN response, the fliv- 
J -~*- ver vibrated. Grampa looked 
querulously toward the airlock. 
“Flivver shouldn’t shake like that. 
Not with the polarizer turned on.” 
The airlock door swung inward. 
Through the oval doorway walked 
Fred, followed closely by Junior. 
They were sweat-stained and 
weary, scintillation counters dang- 

69 



ling heavily from their belts. 

“Any luck?” Reba asked bright- 
ly- 

“Do we look it?” Junior grum- 
bled. 

“Where’s Joyce?” asked Fred. 
“Might as well get everybody in 
on this at once. Joyce!” 

The door to his wife’s room 
opened instantly. Behind it, Joy- 
ce was regal and slim. The pose 
was spoiled immediately by her 
avid question: “Any uranium? 

Radium? Thorium?” 

“No,” Fred said slowly, “and no 
other heavy metals, either. 
There’s a few low-grade iron de- 
posits and that’s it.” 

“Then what makes this planet 
so heavy?” Reba asked. 

Junior shrugged helplessly and 
collapsed into a chair. “Your 
guess is as good as anybody’s.” 
“Then we’ve wasted another 
week on a worthless rock,” Joyce 
complained. She turned savagely 
on Fred. “This was going to make 
us all filthy rich. We were going 
to find radioactives and retire to 
Earth like billionaires. And all 
we’ve done is spent a year of our 
lives in this cramped old flivver 
— and we don’t have many of 
them to spare!” She glared ve- 
nomously at Grampa. 

“We’ve still got Fweepland,” 
Four said solemnly. 

“Fweepland?” Reba repeated. 
“This planet. It’s not big, but 
it’s fertile and it’s harmless. As 



real estate, it’s worth almost as 
much as if it were solid uranium.” 
“A good thing, too,” Junior said 
glumly, “because this looks like 
the end of our search. Short of a 
miracle, we’ll spend the rest of our 
lives right here — involuntary 
colonists.” 

Joyce spun on him. “You’re 
joking!” she screeched. 

“I wish I were,” Junior said. 
“But the polarizer won’t work. 
Either it’s broken or there’s some- 
thing about the gravity around 
here that just won’t polarize.” 
“It’s these ’23 models,” Grampa 
put in disgustedly. “They never 
were any good.” 

T HE LAND OF the Fweep 
turned slowly on its axis. The 
orange sun set and rose again 
and stared down once more at 
the meadow where the improb- 
able spaceship rested on its im- 
probable stern. The sixteen Earth 
hours that the rotation had taken 
had changed nothing inside the 
ship, either. 

Grampa looked up from his 
pircuit and said, “If I were you, 
Junior, I would take a good look 
at the TV repairman when we get 
back to Earth. If we get back to 
Earth,” he amended. “You can’t 
be Four’s father. All over the 
Universe, gravity is the same, and 
if it’s gravity, the polarizer will 
polarize it.” 

“That’s just supposition,” Jun- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ior said stubbornly. “The fact is, 
it isn’t because it doesn’t. Q.E.D.” 

“Maybe the polarizer is bro- 
ken,” Fred suggested. 

Grampa snorted. “Broken- 
shmoken. Nothing to break, 
Young Fred. Just a few coils of 
copper wire and they’re all right. 
We checked. We know the power 
plant is working: the lights are 
on, the air and water recircula- 
tion systems are going, the food 
resynthesizer is okay. And, any- 
way, the polarizer could work 
from the storage battery if it had. 
to.” 

“Then it goes deeper,” Junior 
insisted. “It goes right to the 
principle of polarization itself. 
For some reason, it doesn’t work 
here. Why? Before we can dis- 
cover the answer to that, we’ll 
have to know more about polar- 
ization itself. How does it work, 
Grampa?” 

Grampa gave him a sarcastic 
grin. “Now you’re curious, eh? 
Couldn’t be bothered with Gram- 
pa’s invention before. Oh, no! Too 
busy. Accept without question the 
blessings that the Good Lord pro- 
videth — ” 

“Let’s not get up on any pul- 
pits,” Fred growled. “Come on, 
Grampa, what’s the theory behind 
polarization?” 

Grampa looked at the four 
faces staring at him hopefully and 
the jeering grin turned to a smile. 
“Well,” he said, “at last. You know 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



how light is polarized, eh?” The 
smile faded. “No, I guess you 
don’t.” 

TT E CLEARED his throat pro- 
AA fessorially. “Well, now, in 
ordinary light the vibrations are 
perpendicular to the ray in all 
directions. When light is polarized 
by passing through crystals or by 
reflection or refraction at non-me- 
tallic surfaces, the paths of the 
vibrations are still perpendicular 
to the ray, but they’re in^ straight 
lines, circles or ellipses.” 

The faces were still blank and 
unillumined. 

“Gravity is similar to light,” he 
pressed on. “In the absence of 
matter, gravity is non-polarized. 
Matter 'polarizes gravity in a cir- 
cle around itself. That’s how we’- 
ve always known it until the in- 
vention of spaceships and later 
the polarizer. The polarizer polar- 
izes gravity into a straight line. 
That makes the ship take off 
and continue accelerating until 
the polarizer is shut off or its 
angle is shifted.” 

The faces looked at him silent- 
ly. Finally Joyce could endure it 
no longer. “That’s just nonsense! 
You all know it. Grampa’s no 
genius. He’s just a tinkerer. One 
day he happened to tinker out 
the polarizer. He doesn’t know 
how it works any more than I do.” 

“Now wait a minute!” Grampa 
protested. “That’s not fair. Maybe 

71 



I didn’t figure out the theory my- 
self, but I read everything the 
scientists ever wrote about it. 
Wanted to know myself what 
made the blamed thing work. 
What I told you is what the sci- 
entists said, near as I remember. 
Now me — I’m like Edison. I do 
it and let everybody else worry 
over ‘why.’” 

“The only thing you ever did 
was the polarizer,” Joyce snapped. 
“And then you spent everything 
you got from it on those fool 
perpetual-motion machines and 
those crazy longevity schemes 
when any moron would know 
they were impossible.” 

Grampa squinted at her sagely. 
“That’s what they said about the 
gravity polarizer before I in- 
vented it.” 

“But you don’t really know 
why it works,” Junior persisted. 

“Well, no,” Grampa admitted. 
“Actually I was just fiddling 
around with some coils when one 
of them took off. Went right 
through the ceiling, dragging a 
battery behind it. I guess it’s still 
going. Ought to be out near the 
Horsehead Nebula by now. Luck- 
ily, I remembered how I’d wound 
it.” 

“Why won’t the ship work then, 
if you know so much?” Joyce de- 
manded ironically. 

“Well, now,” Grampa said in 
bafflement, “it rightly should, you 
know.” 



66 W7 E’RE STUCK,” Reba said 
»» softly. We might as well 
admit it. All we can do is set the 
transmitter to send out an auto- 
matic distress call — ” 

“Which,” Joyce interrupted, 
“might get picked up in a few 
centuries.” 

“And make the best of what 
we’ve got,” Reba went on, un- 
heeding. “If we look at it the 
right way, it’s quite a lot. A beau- 
tiful, fertile world. Earth gravity. 
The flivver — even if the polar- 
izer won’t work, there’s the re- 
synthesizer; it will keep us in 
food and clothes for years. By 
then, we should have a good- 
sized community built up, be- 
cause out here we won’t have to 
stop with one child. We can have 
all the babies we want.” 

“You know the law: one child 
per couple,” Joyce reminded her 
frigidly. “You can condemn your- 
self to exile from civilization if 
you wish. Not me.” 

Junior frowned at his wife. “I 
believe you’re actually glad it 
happened.” 

“I could think of worse things,” 
Reba said. 

“I like your spunk, Reb,” Gram- 
pa muttered. 

“Speaking of children,” Jun- 
ior said, “where’s Four?” 

“Here.” Four came through the 
airlock and trudged across the 
room, carrying a curious contrap- 
tion made of tripod legs support- 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing a small box from which dan- 
gled a plumb bob. Behind Four, 
like a round, raspberry shadow, 
rolled Fweep. 

“Fweep?” it queried hopefully. 

“Not now,” said Four. 

“Where’ve you been?” Reba 
asked anxiously. “What’ve you 
been doing?” 

“I’ve been all over Fweepland,” 
Four said wearily, “trying to lo- 
cate its center of gravity.” 

“Well?” Fred prompted. 

“It shifts.” 

“That’s impossible,” said Jun- 
ior. 

“Not for Fweep,” Four replied. 

“What do you mean by that?~ 
Joyce suspiciously asked. 

“It shifted,” Four explained pa- 
tiently, “because Fweep kept fol- 
lowing me.” 

“Fweep?” Junior repeated stu- 
pidly. 

“Fweep?” Fweep said eagerly. 

“He’s why the flivver won’t 
work. What Grampa invented 
was a linear polarizer. Fweep is 
a circular polarizer. He’s what 
makes this planet so heavy. He’s 
why we can’t leave.” 

T HE LAND of the Fweep ro- 
tated once on its axis, and 
Grampa lowered the nippled bot- 
tle from his lips. He sighed. “I 
got it figured out, Four,” he said, 
holding out the pircuit proudly. 
“A missionary takes over a non- 
rowing type cannibal, leaves him 



there, and then the rowing can- 
nibal takes over the other canni- 
bal and leaves him there and — ” 

“Not now, Grampa,” Four said 
inattentively as he watched 
Fweep making the grand tour of 
the cabin. 

The raspberry sphere swept 
over a scattering of crumbs, en- 
gulfed them, absorbed them. Four 
looked at Joyce. Joyce was watch- 
ing Fweep, too. 

“Rat poison?” Four asked. 

Joyce started guiltily. “How 
did you know?” 

“There’s no use trying to poison 
Fweep,” Four said calmly. “He’s 
got no enzymes to act on, no ner- 
vous system to paralyze. He 
doesn’t even use what he ‘eats’ 
on a molecular level at all.” 

“What level does he use?” Jun- 
ior wanted to know. 

“Point the scintillation counter 
at him.” 

Junior dug one of the counters 
out of the supply cabinet and 
aimed the pickup at Fweep. The 
counter began to hum. As Fweep 
approached, the hum rose in 
pitch. As it passed, the hum drop- 
ped. 

Junior looked at the counter’s 
dial. “He’s radioactive, all right. 
“Not much, but enough. But 
where does he get the radioactive 
material?” 

“He uses ordinary matter,” 
Four said. “He must have used 
up the few deposits of natural 



THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



73 



radioactives a long time ago.” 
“He uses ordinary substances 
on an atomic level?” Junior said 
unbelievingly. 

Four nodded. “And that ‘skin’ 
of his — whatever it is he uses 
for skin — is more efficient in 
stopping particle emissions than 
several feet of lead.” 

Fred studied Fweep thought- 
fully. “Maybe we could feed him 
enough enriched uranium from 
the pile to put him over the criti- 
cal mass.” 

“And blow him up? I don’t 
think it’s possible, but even if it 
were, it might be a trifle more 
than disastrous for us.” Four gig- 
gled at the thought. 

J OYCE GLARED at him fu- 
riously. “Four! Act your age! 
We’ve got to do something with 
him. It’s preposterous that we 
should be detained here at the 
whim of a mere blob!” 

“I don’t figure it’s a whim,” 
Grampa said. “Circular gravity is 
what he’s got to have for one 
reason or another, so he just 
naturally bends the space-time 
continuum around him — consci- 
ous or subconscious, I don’t know. 
But protoplasm is always more 
efficient than machines, so the 
flivver won’t move.” 

“I dcn’t care why that thing 
does it,” Joyce said icily. “I want 
it stopped, and the sooner the 
better. If it won’t turn the gravity 

74 



off, we’ll just have to do away 
with it.” 

“How?” asked Four. “Fweep’s 
skin is pretty close to impervious 
and you can’t shoot him, stab him 
or poison him. He doesn’t breathe, 
so you can’t drown or strangle 
him. You can’t imprison him; he 
‘eats’ everything. And violence 
might be more dangerous to us 
than to him. Right now, Fweep 
is friendly, but suppose he got 
mad! He could lower his radio- 
active shield or he might increase 
the gravity by a few times. Either 
way, you’d feel rather uncomfort- 
able, Grammy.” 

“Don’t call me ‘Grammy!’ Well, 
what are we going to do, just sit 
around and wait for that thing to 
die?” 

“We’d have a long wait,” Four 
observed. “Fweep is the only one 
of his kind on this planet.” 

“Well?” 

“Probably he’s immortal.” 

“And he doesn’t reproduce?” 
Reba asked sympathetically. 

“Probably not. If he doesn’t 
die, there’s no point in reproduc- 
tion. Reproduction is nature’s 
way of providing racial immor- 
tality to mortal creatures.” 

“But he must have some way 
of reproduction,” Reba argued. 
“An egg or something. He couldn’t 
just have sprung into being as he 
is now.” 

“Maybe he developed,” Four 
offered. “It seems to me that he’s 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bigger than when we first landed.” 

“He must have been here a 
long, long time,” Fred said. 
“Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept 
its* atmosphere and its water, 
which a planet this size ordinarily 
would have lost by now.” 

j) EBA LOOKED at Fweep 
kindly. “We can thank the 
little fellow for that, anyway.” 

“I thank him for nothing,” Joy- 
ce snapped. “He lured us down 
here by making us think the 
planet had heavy metals and I 
want him to let us go immedi- 
ately!” 

Fred turned impatiently on his 
wife. “Well, try making him un- 
derstand! And if you can 
make him understand what you 
want him to do, try making him 
do it!” 

Joyce looked at Fred with 
startled eyes. “Fred!” she said in 
a high, shocked voice and turned 
blindly toward her room. 

Grampa lowered his bottle and 
smacked his lips. “Well, boy,” he 
said to Fred, “I thought you’d 
never do that. Didn’t think you 
had it in you.” 

Fred stood up apologetically. 
“I’d better go calm her down,” he 
muttered, and walked quickly af- 
ter Joyce. 

“Give her one for me!” Grampa 
called. 

Fred’s shoulders twitched as 
the door closed behind him. From 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



the room came the filtered sound 
of high-pitched voices rising and 
falling like some reedy folk mu- 
sic. 

“Makes you think, doesn’t it?” 
Grampa said, looking at Fweep 
benignly. “Maybe the whole 
theory of gravitation is cockeyed. 
Maybe there’s a Fweep for every 
planet and sun, big and little, pol- 
arizing the gravity in circles, and 
the matter business is not a cause 
but a result.” 

“What I can’t understand,” Jun- 
ior said thoughtfully, “is why the 
polarizer worked for a little while 
when we landed — long enough 
to keep us from being squashed 
— and then quit.” 

“Fweep didn’t recognize it im- 
mediately, didn’t know what it 
was or where it came from,” Four 
explained. “All he knew was he 
didn’t like linear polarization and 
he neutralized it as soon as he 
could. That’s when we dropped.” 

INEAR POLARIZATION 
is uncomfortable for him, 
is it?” Grampa said. “Makes you 
wonder how something like 
Fweep could ever develop.” 

“He’s no more improbable than 
people,” said Four. 

“Less than some I’ve known,” 
Grampa conceded. 

“If he can eat anything,” Reba 
said, “why does he keep sweep- 
ing the cabin for dust and lint?” 
“He wants to be helpful,” Four 

75 



replied without hesitation, “and 
he’s lonely. After all,” he added 
wistfully, “he’s never had any 
friends.” 

“How do you know all these 
things?” Joyce asked from her 
doorway, excitement in her voice. 
“Can you talk to it?” 

Behind her, Fred said, “Now, 
Joyce, you promised — ” 

“But this is important,” Joyce 
cut him off eagerly. “Can you? 
Talk to it, I mean?” 

“Some,” Four admitted. 

“Have you asked it to let us 
go?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well? What did it say?” 

“He said he didn’t want his 
friend to leave him.” 

At the word, Fweep rolled 
swiftly across the floor and 
bounced into Four’s lap. It nestled 
against him lovingly and opened 
raspberry lips. “Fwiend,” it said. 

“Well, now,” Grampa said ma- 
liciously, his eye on Joyce, “that’s 
no problem. We can just leave 
Four here with Fweep.” 

In a voice filled with sancti- 
monious concern, Joyce said, 
“That’s quite a sacrifice to ask, 
but — ” 

“Joyce!” Reba cried, horrified. 
“Grampa was joking, but you ac- 
tually mean it. Four is only a 
baby and yet you’d let him — ” 
“Never mind, Reba,” Four said 
evenly. “It was just what I was 
going to suggest myself. It’s the 



one really logical solution.” 

“Fwiend,” said Fweep gently. 

HE LAND of the Fweep 
turned like a fat old man 
toasting himself in front of an 
open fire, and Junior sat at the 
computer’s keyboard swearing in 
a steady monotone. 

“Junior!” said Joyce, shocked. 

Junior swung around impati- 
ently. “Sorry, Mother, but this 
damned thing won’t work.” 

“I’m sure that calling it names 
won’t help, and besides, you 
shouldn’t expect a machine to do 
something that we can’t do. And 
if it did work, it would only say 
that the logical answer is the one 
I sug — ” 

“Mother!” Junior warned. “We 
decided not to talk about it any 
more. Four is strange enough 
without encouraging him to think 
like a martyr. It’s out of the ques- 
tion. If that’s the only way we can 
leave this planet, we’ll stay here 
until Four has a beard as white 
as Grampa’s!” 

“Well!” Joyce said in a stiff, 
offended tone and sat back in her 
chair. 

Grampa lowered the nippled 
bottle from his lips and chortled. 
“Junior, I apologize for all the 
mean things I ever said about 
you. Maybe you got the makings 
of a Peppergrass yet.” 

Junior turned back to the key- 
board and studied it, his chin in 




76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his hand. “It‘s just a matter of 
stating the problem in terms the 
computer can work on.” 

“I take it all back,” said Gram- 
pa. “That computer won’t help 
you with this problem, Junior. 
This ain’t a long, complicated cal- 
culation; it’s a simple problem 
in logic. It’s a ^pircuit problem, 
like the one about the cannibals 
and the missionaries. We can’t 
leave Fweepland because Fweep 
won’t let our polarizer work. He 
won’t let crtir polarizer work be- 
cause he doesn’t like gravity 
that’s polarized in a straight line, 
and he don’t want Four to leave 
him. 

“Now Fweep ain’t the bright- 
est creature in the Universe, so 
he can’t understand why we’re so 
gosh-fired eager to leave. And as 
long as he’s got Four, he’s happy. 
Why should he make himself un- 
happy? As a favor to Four, he’d 
let us leave — if we’d leave Four 
here with him, which we ain’t 
gonna do. 

“That’s the problem. All we got 
to do is figure out the answer. 
No use making a pircuit, because 
a puzzle circuit is just a minature 
computer with the solution built 
in; if you can build the pircuit, 
you’ve already solved the prob- 
lem. And if you can state the 
problem to Abacus, you’ve al- 
ready got the answer. All you 
want from it then is decimal 
points.” 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



“That may be,” Junior said 
stubbornly, “but I still want to 
know why this computer won’t 
work. It won’t even do simple 
arithmetic! Where’s Four? He’s 
the only one who understands 
this thing.” 

“He’s outside, playing in the 
meadow with Fweep,” Reba said, 
her voice soft. “No, here they 
come now.” 

T HROUGH THE airlock came 
Four, carrying Fweep on 
his shoulder like a raspberry cat 
without head or tail. Four’s thin 
face glowed with exertion and 
glistened with sweat. Already the 
orange sun had begun to paint his 
skin tan. 

“We’ve been playing dodge 
ball,” Four panted. “Fweep was 
the ball and I had to dodge him.” 
“There’s something wrong with 
this computer,” Junior com- 
plained. “Take a look at it.” 
“Sure, Daddy,”. Four said 
promptly, and he took his fa- 
ther’s place at the keyboard. 
After a few moments, he began 
to frown, then detached a front 
panel. He started sorting through 
the maze of wires and electronic 
components. 

Grampa watched him with a 
wary eye. 

Joyce was unable to restrain 
herself any longer. “The way you 
people talk, a person would think 
we were never going to leave this 

77 



godforsaken, miserable, uncivi- 
lized planet.” 

“That seems to be the general 
idea,” Grampa chuckled, enjoying 
her dismay. 

“Unless we can build a reac- 
tion rocket ship to push us out 
of Fweep’s range,” Fred said 
glumly. 

“We’ve got the iron ore!” Jun- 
ior put in eagerly. 

Grampa snorted. “Come on, use 
your brains. You’d have to build 
a ship; these flivvers weren’t 
built for the stresses of reaction 
flight. By the time you’ve solved 
all the problems of motors and 
alloys and rocket-tube linings, 
fuel, ship construction, personnel 
protection, and all the rest of it, 
this planet would be another 
Detroit and your great-great- 
great-grandchildren would be liv- 
ing in it. You couldn’t build a 
blast furnace even if you had the 
complete Congressional microfilm 
library! You’d do better trying to 
figure out how Fweep does what 
he does and doing some prac- 
ticing on that.” 

“Well,” Junior said peevishly, 
“trying to get away is better than 
sitting here talking about it.” 

Reba stared thoughtfully at 
Junior and said, “Maybe Fweep 
would go with us.” 

“Yes!” Joyce said excitedly. 
“Maybe the dear little thing 
would go with' us. That would 
solve everything!” 



W ITHOUT looking around, 
Fout said, “I asked him al- 
ready. Fweep’s afraid to come 
along.” 

“I’m sure we would be very 
good to him,” Joyce said swiftly. 
“I’ve always liked pets. Why, I 
once had a goldfish of my very 
own!” 

“Which you let die,” Fred said 
dryly, “because you forgot to feed 
it.” 

“Oh, he’s not afraid of people,” 
Four told them. “He’s afraid of 
space and unpolarized gravity 
and things like that. He’s lived 
here all his life — that’s a long 
time — and it makes him feel 
awful funny just to think about 
leaving. He says he can still re- 
member the way our linear gra- 
vitation felt inside when we 
landed.” 

“Well,” Joyce said firmly, “he’ll 
just have to fight it, that’s all. 
If a person let that kind of neu- 
rotic impulse rule his life, he’d be 
completely demoralized in no 
time.” 

Four glanced over his shoulder 
at Joyce, as if to see if she were 
joking. Shaking his head, he re- 
turned to the computer’s innards. 
A moment later, he swung around 
and stared accusingly at Grampa. 
“You’ve cannibalized Abacus!” 
“Well, now,” Grampa protested, 
licking his lips nervously. “You 
see, I — ” 

“That’s where you got the parts 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



for the pircuits!” Four said with 
merciless logic. 

Joyce stood up virtuously and 
shook her finger at Grampa. 
“First you entice us out here in 
this nasty old flivver; then you get 
us stuck; and now you’ve ruined 
the computer for your nasty old 
games!” 

“Well, now,” Grampa blustered, 
“the goldarn thing wouldn’t work, 
would it? We didn’t need it — not 
with Four around. He figures 
everything out in his head and 
we just x used Abacus to sort of 
check him. Ain’t that right now?” 

Five pairs of eyes stared at 
him in silence. 

“Well, now,” Grampa said de- 
fensively, “I got it all worked out 
anyhow. We can leave here any 
time we get ready.” 

T HE LAND of the Fweep 
turned and grew small in the 
view screen, and Junior sat in the 
pilot’s chair, his hand on the con- 
trol stick, his eyes fixed on the 
moving dials in front of him. 

There were three others in the 
room: Reba, who looked at the 
dwindling Fweepland and sighed; 
Joyce, who sat tautly in her 
chair, her face fixed and unbe- 
lieving; and Fred, who looked at 
Joyce and shook his head. 

Grampa opened the door to 
his room and stepped cockily into 
the central cabin, shutting the 
door behind him. “Well?” he de- 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



manded confidently. “Are we 
heading for Earth?” 

Junior gestured toward the 
screen. “If Four’s coordinates are 
right.” 

“Speaking of coordinates,” 
Grampa said briskly, “make sure 
we got the coordinates of Fweep- 
land. It’ll take a long time for 
that atmosphere to dissipate. A 
nice little world like that is worth 
its weight in uranium to a good 
real estate salesman.” 

“How did you do it?” Joyce 
challenged. 

Grampa slapped her familiarly 
on the shoulder. “A problem of 
gravity,” he said gayly, “but a 
simple one. Nothing for an old 
pircuit man like me. I guess you 
folks won’t laugh at Grampa and 
his pircuits any more. Not only 
did Grampa get you out of Fweep- 
land, but he’s taking you back 
with a valuable little subdivision 
in the third quadrant to file on.” 

“I hate to spoil the party,” Fred 
said, “but have you thought about 
what you’re going to do with 
Fweep?” 

“Fweep?” Grampa repeated, 
puzzled. “Why should I do any- 
thing with Fweep?” 

“We can’t take him back to 
Earth with us.” 

“Why not?” Grampa demanded. 

“In the first place, the Immi- 
gration Authority would have to 
pass on him. That might take 
years, with Fweep’s powers and 

79 




abilities. More important, if 
Fweep got loose on Earth, every 
flivver would have the same prob- 
lem there that we had here. And 
next time Fweep might not be 
so cooperative. I don’t know what 
you did to Fweep in there, but 
if he’s still alive, the I.A. isn’t 
going to take a chance.” 

Grampa considered the pros- 
pect without dismay. “I wonder if 
we could smuggle him in. With all 
those flivvers not working, they’d 
have to pay us before they could 



take off.” 

“Grampa!” Fred said sternly. 
“That would be blackmail — or 
worse. Besides getting in trouble 
with the I.A., you’d get it from 
the W.B.I. and the I.C.C.” 

G rampa waved his hand 

impatiently. “We’ll solve that 
problem when we come to it. 
After all, an old pircuit man like 
me — ” 

“What did you do to Fweep?” 
Joyce repeated insistently. 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Grampa cleared his throat with 
pride. “Well, now, I’ll tell you. I 
just happened to notice that 
Fweep liked my tonic. Every 
time I took a little nip, the little 
beast was around my chair, trying 
to clean my hand for me.” 

“Tonic!” Joyce sniffed. “Li- 
quor, you mean!” 

“Now that’s not right,” Gram- 
pa objected. “I said tonic and I 
mean tonic. Got a little alcohol in 
it for a preservative, maybe, but 
the important part is the minerals. 

THE GRAVITY BUSINESS 



That’s the Longevity Institute’s 
secret. It’s what keeps me young. 
Want a little nip?” He leered at 
Joyce. 

“You mean you got Fweep 
drunk?” Fred exclaimed. 

“Well, now, that was the ef- 
fect, but I can’t swear it was the 
alcohol. Not unless Fweep can use 
the stuff on the molecular level if 
he wants. On the other hand, 
maybe it was the minerals in 
there that affected him. Little 
world like Fweepland, maybe it 

81 



lacked a few things when it was 
made. But the way I looked at 
it, it stood to reason the little fel- 
low could use a drink. Alone all 
these centuries, he must’ve got 
pretty dry. But whatever it was, 
he sure got high. Lost all control.” 
“Poor Fweep,” Reba murmured. 
“Poor nothing,” Grampa said. 
“He was the happiest little crit- 
ter I ever saw. When Four ex- 
plained to him just what we 
wanted, he went right to work on 
that bottle and — ” 

Gramp’s door swung open 
once more. “Grampa! Grampa!” 
Four shouted. “Fweep! He — I 
mean — well, we’ve been calling 
him by the wrong pronoun. Look!” 
Four came running out of the 
room. Behind him rolled a tiny 
raspberry sphere about the size of 
a marble. Occasionally it hopped 
in the air and said, “Fweep?” in 
a small, high voice. 

Behind it rolled and hopped 
a second raspberry marble. 
“Fweep?” it said. Behind it came 
another and another until the 
cabin was full of them, rolling, 
bouncing, calling “Fweep?” 

D azedly, junior counted 

them. “One hundred and one, 
one hundred and two, one hun- 
dred and — ” 

“Oh, Junior,” Reba said, hug- 
ging him excitedly. “Aren’t they 
cute?” 

“What happened?” Grampa 




82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



asked, as dazed as Junior. 

“Maybe it was the tonic,” Four 
said, “but I suspect it was the 
the unpolarized gravity. All of a 
sudden, Fweep started splitting 
like an ameba, over and over. Do 
you suppose that was what made 
him nervous?” 

“That’s the way the little fel- 
low reproduces, all right,” said 
Grampa. “I wonder if he has to 
wait until a race becomes civi- 
lized enough to discover the po- 
larizer, eh?” 

“Ugh!” gasped Joyce, brushing 
a Fweep out of her lap. 

Grampa looked at the cabin 
and its occupants happily. 

“I’d like to remind you,” Fred 
said gravely, “that this multiplies 
our problem of what to do with 
Fweep over one hundred times.” 

“What problem?” asked Gram- 
pa. “The only problem we got is 
how we’re gonna spend the cash. 
We’re in business — the gravity 
business. We’ll call it Gravity, In- 
corporated, and we can reclaim 
every little hunk of rock in the 
Solar System. Each one of those 
little fellows is worth a fortune! 
We’ll give the satellites and the 
asteroids Earth-normal gravities 
and atmospheres and, by golly, 
we’re rich!” 

“Rich?” Joyce echoed. A smile 
slowly replaced the expression of 
distaste. She snapped her fingers. 
“Here, Fweepie,” she said in her 
most enticing tone. “Here, little 



darlings! Come to dear Joyce!” 
But they had all hopped to 
Four and were clustered around 
him like a raspberry bubble bath. 
Through them, his face peered, 
thin and happy. 

Grampa looked at Reba. She 
was hugging Junior happily and 
smiling at Four. Grampa looked 
back at the boy. 

“We’ll have to be exclusive, 
though,” Grampa said. “Consi- 
dering the Fweeps’ likes and dis- 
likes, that is. We’ll sell only to 
people with children.”

The Body 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



They made it — no question of 
that — but what had they made? 



TWTHEN PROFESSOR Meyer 
” opened his eyes he saw, lean- 
ing anxiously over him, three of 
the young specialists who had per- 
formed the operation. It struck 
him at once that they would have 
to be young to attempt what they 
had attempted; young and irre- 
verent, possessed of encyclopedic 
technical knowledge to the ex- 
clusion of all else; iron-nerved, 
steel-fingered, inhuman, in fact. 
They had the qualifications of 
automatons. 

He was so struck by this bit of 



post-anesthetic reasoning that it 
took him a moment to realize that 
the operation had been a success. 
“How do you feel, sir?” 

“Are you all right?” 

“Can you speak, sir? If not, just 
nod your head. Or blink.” 

They watched anxiously. 
Professor Meyer gulped, test- 
ing the limitations of his new 
palate, tongue and throat. Then 
he said, very thickly, “I think — 
I think — ” 

“He’s all right!” Cassidy 
shouted. “Feldman! Wake up!” 



Illustrated by WEISS

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Feldman leaped up from the 
spare cot and fumbled for his 
glasses. “He’s up so soon? Did he 
speak?” 

“Yes, he spoke! He spoke like 
an angel! We finally made it, 
Freddie!” 

Feldman found his glasses and 
rushed to the operating table. 
“Could you say something else, 
sir? Anything?” 

“I am — I am — ” 

“Oh, God,” Feldman said. “I 
think I’m going to faint.” 

The three men burst into laugh- 
ter. They surrounded Feldman 
and slapped him on the back. 
Feldman began to laugh, too, but 
soon he was coughing violently. 

“Where’s Kent?” Cassidy 
shouted. “He should be here, 
damn it. He kept that damned 
ossilyscope on the line for ten 
solid hours. Steadiest thing I ever 
saw. Where the devil is he?” 

“He went after sandwiches,” 
Lupowicz said. “Here he comes. 
Kent, Kent, we made it!” 

Kent came through the door 
carrying two paper bags, with 
half a sandwich thrust in his 
mouth. He swallowed convul- 
sively. “Did he speak? What did 
he say?” 

DEHIND KENT, there was an 
* * uproar. A dozen men rushed 
toward the door. 

“Get them out of here!” Feld- 
man screamed. “They can’t inter- 



view him tonight. Where’s that 
cop?” 

A policeman pushed his way 
through and blocked the door. 
“You heard what the docs said, 
boys.” 

“This isn’t fair. This Meyer, he 
belongs to the world.” 

“What were his first words?” 
“What did he say?” 

“Did you really change him 
into a dog?” 

“What kind of dog?” 

“Can he wag his tail?” 

“He said he was fine,” the po- 
liceman told them, blocking the 
door. “Come on now, boys.” 

A photographer ducked under 
the policeman’s arm. He looked 
at Professor Meyer on the operat- 
ing table and muttered, “Jesus!” 
He raised his camera. “Look up, 
boy — ” 

Kent put his hand over the 
lens as the flashgun popped. 

“Whatdja do that for?” the 
photographer asked. 

“You now have a picture of 
Kent’s hand,” Kent said with sar- 
casm. “Enlarge it, and hang it in 
the Museum of Modern Art. Now, 
get out of here before I break 
your neck.” 

“Come on, boys,” the policeman 
repeated sternly, herding the 
newsmen away. He turned back 
and glanced at Professor Meyer 
on the operating table. “Jesus! I 
still can’t believe it!” he muttered, 
and closed the door.

“The bottles!” Cassidy shouted. 

“A celebration!” 

“By God, we deserve a celebra- 
tion!” 

Professor Meyer smiled — in- 
ternally only, of course, since his 
facial expressions were now lim- 
ited. 

Feldman came up to him. “How 
do you feel, sir?” 

“I am fine,” Meyer said, enun- 
ciating carefully with his strange 
palate. “A little confused, per- 
haps — ” 

“But not regretful?” Feldman 
asked. 

“I don’t know yet,” Meyer said. 
“I was against this on principle, 
you know. No man is indispen- 
sable.” 

“You are, sir.” Feldman spoke 
with fierce conviction. “I followed 
your lectures. Not that I pretend 
to understand one tenth of what 
you were saying. Mathematical 
symbolism is only a hobby with 
me. But those unification princi- 
ples — ” 

“Please,” Meyer said. 

^TVTO, LET me speak, sir,” Feld- 

-L ’ man said. “You are carrying 
on the great work where Einstein 
and the others left off. No one 
else can complete it! No one! You 
had to have a few more years, 
in any form science could give 
you. I only wish we could have 
found a more suitable receptacle 
for your intellect. A human host 



was unavailable, and we were 
forced to rule out the pri- 
mates — ” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Meyer said. 
“It’s the intellect that counts, 
after all. I’m still a little dizzy . .” 

“I remember your last lecture 
at Harvard,” Feldman continued, 
clenching his hands together. 
“You were so old, sir! I could 
have cried — that tired, ruined 
body — ” 

“Can we give you a drink, sir?” 
Cassidy offered Meyer a glass. 

Meyer laughed. “I’m afraid my 
new facial configuration is not 
suited for glasses. A bowl would 
be preferable.” 

“Right!” Cassidy said. “One 
bowl coming up! Lord, Lord . .” 

“You’ll have to excuse us, sir,” 
Feldman apologized. “The strain 
has been terrific. We’ve been in 
this room for over a week, and I 
doubt if one of us had eight hours 
sleep in that time. We almost lost 
you, sir — ” 

“The bowl! The flowing bowl is 
here!” Lupowicz called. “What’ll 
it be, sir? Rye? Gin?” 

“Just water, please,” Meyer 
said. “Do you think I could get 
up?” 

“If you’ll take it easy . Lu- 
powicz lifted him gently from the 
table and set him on the floor. 
Meyer balanced uneasily on his 
four legs. 

The men cheered him wildly. 
“Bravo!”

“I believe I may be able to do 
some- work tomorrow,” Meyer 
said. “Some sort of an apparatus 
will have to be devised to enable 
me to write. It shouldn’t be too 
difficult. There will be other prob- 
lems attendant upon my change 
I’m not thinking too clearly as 
yet . .” 

“Don’t try to rush things.” 

“Hell, no! Can’t lose you now!” 

“What a paper this is going to 
make!” 

“Collaborative effort, do you 
think, or each from his own view- 
point and specialty?” 

“Both, both. They’ll never get 
enough of this. Goddamn it, 
they’ll be talking about this — ” 

“Where is the bathroom?” 
Meyer asked. 

The men looked at each other. 

“What for?” 

“Shut up, you idiot. This way, 
sir. I’ll open the door for you.” 

EYER FOLLOWED at the 
man’s heels, perceiving, as he 
walked, the greater ease inherent 
in four-legged locomotion. When 
he returned, the men were talking 
heatedly about technical aspects 
of his case. 

“ — never again in a million 
years.” 

“I can’t agree with you. Any- 
thing we can do once — ” 

“Don’t get scientific on us, kid. 
You know damned well it was a 
weird combination of fortuitous 

88 



factors — plain blind luck!” 

“You can say that again. Some 
of those bio-electric changes — ” 
“He’s back.” 

“Yeah, but he shouldn’t be 
walking around too much. How 
you feeling, boy?” 

“I’m not a boy,” Professor Mey- 
er snapped. “I’m old enough to 
be your grandfather.” 

“Sorry, sir. I think you should 
go to bed, sir.” 

“Yes,” Professor Meyer said. 
“I’m not too strong yet, not too 
clear . .” 

Kent lifted him and placed him 
on the cot. “There, how’s that?” 
They gathered around him, 
their arms linked around bach 
other’s shoulders. They were grin- 
ning, and very proud of them- 
selves. 

“Anything we can get you?” 
“Just call for it, we’ll bring it.” 
“Here, I’ve filled your bowl 
with water.” 

“We’ll leave a couple , sand- 
wiches by your cot.” 

“Have a good rest,” Cassidy 
said tenderly. 

Then, involuntarily, absent- 
mindedly, he patted Professor 
Meyer on his long, smooth-furred 
head. 

Feldman shouted something in- 
coherent. 

“I forgot,” Cassidy said in em- 
barrassed apology. 

“We’ll have to watch ourselves. 
He’s a man, you know.”

“Of course I know. I must be 
tired ... I mean, he looks so much 
like a dog, you kinda forget — ” 
“Get out of here!” Feldman or- 
dered. “Get out! All of you!” 

He pushed them out of the 
room and hurried back to Profes- 
sor Meyer. 

“Is there anything I can do, sir? 
Anything at all?” 

Meyer tried to speak, to re- 
affirm his humanity. But the 
words came out choked. 

“It’ll never happen again, sir. 



I’m sure of it. Why, you’re — 
you’re Professor Meyer!” 

Quickly Feldman pulled a blan- 
ket over Meyer’s shivering body. 

“It’s all right, sir,” Feldman 
said, trying not to look at the 
shivering animal. “It’s the intel- 
lect that counts, sir. The mind!” 
“Of course,” agreed Professor 
Meyer, the eminent mathemati- 
cian. “But I wonder — would you 
mind patting my head for me, 
please?”

FORECAST 

Next month brings a sweat-provoking novella right in the middle of winter — BODY- 
GUARD by Christopher Grimm. But we can promise that it will be a cold sweat and you 
can look forward to some achingly taut muscles even after you finish the story. Why such 
tension? Well, put yourself in this alarming predicament: 

When overwhelming danger is constantly present, of course a man is entitled to have 
a bodyguard. But what if he has to do the job himself . and his body absolutely will 
not cooperate? 

After much too long an absence, Arthur Sellings returns with THE CATEGORY INVEN- 
TORS, a novelet worth waiting for. Writers have persistently poked holes in Utopias of all 
sorts, overlooking the fact that nothing could be better suited for those who like security. 
And security there is a-plenty in this well-run world. The only trouble is, how about those 
who want to get ahead? What happens to ambitious people in this story could never 
happen to a robot! 

You'll find at least another novelet and all the short stories we can cram into the issue 
. plus an eyebrow-raising tour of THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON guided by Willy 
Ley. So you think it's a complete enigma, eh? You'll be astonished to discover just how 
much of it is nothing of the kind! 

The big news of the year, of course, is that GALAXY now reaches the newsstands so 
much earlier than before. In case there is still some confusion about whatever became of 
the December issue, here is the data: To advance the date of sale, we were forced, in effect, 
to combine the December and January issues . but the volume and number follow the 
November issue consecutively, so we haven't skippd any issue at all. You'll get the full 12 
of them this 1 year, same as always.

SALAMANDERS & OTHER 
WONDERS by Willy Ley. The 
Viking Press, $3.95 

A T this writing, the proposed 
space satellite has burst across 
all the front pages. Our Willy 
Ley, as one of the foremost ex- 
perts of the day, has become as 
familiar to TV audiences as How- 
dy Doody. Therefore, it seems pe- 
culiar to be reviewing his nature 
book at this time. About the only 
connection between this and his 
sudden general fame is that he is 
busily engaged in unearthing the 
truth about Old Wives’ Tales 
such as the “Man-Eating Tree.” 



For a factual book, it has a 
delightful touch of the detective 
story about it, due to the author’s 
knack of presenting successive 
data so that it has the flavor of 
an exciting chase. I’m sure you’ll 
find a favorite of yours here . 
the Abominable Snowmen or the 
Tree of Death, perhaps. They’re 
the ones I liked best.

The novelets by Sturgeon and

The rest are mostly very good

All in all, a fine job of selec-

quote the blurb on the cover.

A CCORDING to the author 
of this sequel to Flying Sau- 
cers Have Landed, the Flying 
Saucers have returned and this 
time he has had the good for- 
tune to be taken for several rides, 
both in the Saucers themselves 
and in their mother ships. Adam- 
ski avers that the Saucers are 
not interplanetary craft but com- 
parable to dinghies, strictly ship- 
to-shore. 

He accompanies the text with 
a number of pictures of both 
types of craft, including a series 
which he claims represents him- 
self and a Venusian snapped at 
the portholes of a small mother 
ship by the pilot of a Saucer. 

The reader will have to de- 
cide for himself as to the vera- 
city of the book. But I believe 
that no one can find fault with

THE TRANSPOSED MAN by 
Dwight V. Swain and ONE IN 
THREE HUNDRED by J. T. 
McIntosh. Ace Books, Inc., 35c 

T¥7ALK into any bookstore and 
see what an imposing array 
the Double Novels have become. 
This month we have two new is- 
sues. The first has the excellent 
One In Three Hundred by McIn- 
tosh, which first appeared as 
three separate novelets in Fan- 
tasy & Science Fiction and last 
year in hard covers. It brings to 
mind Wylie and Balmer’s old 
When Worlds Collide. 

Having reread the latter quite 
recently, it was a revelation to 
see how modern s-f stacks up 
against a true classic. Here is 
almost identical subject matter 
and plot. The difference lies in 
the manner in which the modern 
craftsman succeeds in making 
his reader live the story. 

The Transposed Man fills the 
balance of the book by elimina- 
ting blank pages. If you must 
know, it concerns a fanatic So- 
ciety, the Mechanists, trying to 
overthrow the bumbling demo- 
cratic government, and the part 
played by the Hero, a misguided 
shnook. He’s a spy who keeps 
getting under everybody’s skin 
. but only to plant an identity-

transferring device. The author 
deserves a medal for finishing the 
book. So does the reader. 

NO WORLD OF THEIR OWN 
by Poul Anderson & THE lOOO 
YEAR PLAN by Isaac Asimov. 
Ace Books Inc., 35c 

T^HIS is the second Double 
novel entry. The Asimov, of 
course, is the first few chapters 
of his famous “Foundation” series, 
up to and including “The Trad- 
ers.” Even after a decade, it is 
still a refreshing experience to 
read about Hari Seldon and his 
Psychohistory, the charting of fu- 
ture history by means of deduc- 
tive Mass Psychology. It has a 
sweep and tongue-in-cheek craf- 
tiness worthy of a modern Ara- 
bian Nights. Guaranteed to make 
you feel ten years younger. 

No World of their Own is an 
original, but not very. It uses the 
device of hyperspace travel to 
dump the hero into an irrevocable 
future 5,000 years from his own, 
along with his two crewmates 
and a creature from 2,000 light- 
years distant that has the faculty 
of influencing electron flow in any 
apparatus. 

Since Earth is ruled by the Ser- 
vants of Technon, a super-duper- 
computer, and threatened by the 
League of Alpha Centauri and 
menaced by the Commercial So- 
ciety, you can soon see why the 



poor hero all but mumbles, “Lem- 
me alone, willya?” That’s 50% on 
two books. Mmm, somebody 
should get together with himself. 

NOT THIS AUGUST by C. M. 
Kornbluth. Doubleday & Co., Inc., 
$2.95 

T IKE last month’s Point Ulti- 
mate by Jerry Sohl, this book 
deals with a Communist invasion 
of the U.S.A. But whereas the 
former commences thirty years af- 
ter the invasion, this opus takes us 
through the final defeat. Also, it 
is a blunt, hard-bitten account of 
the brutalization the American 
populace is subjected to in order 
to learn their new role, that of 
peasant. It is believable through- 
out and thoroughly frightening. 

Basically, the plots of the two 
books are virtually identical, but 
Kornbluth’s has an authenticity 
comparable to the better war no- 
vels of the past decade. 

Incidentally, you don’t know 
with what restraint this apprecia- 
tive review was written. The most 
obnoxious character in the book 
is named Floyd C. 

FAR AND AWAY by Anthony

Science Fiction is an event, but 
not a satisfactory one.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The obvious explanation is 
that it’s mostly a roster of youth- 
ful literary recruits from the old 
Unknown and Astounding, with 
some more recent eager wisps of 
volunteers, none of them able to 
stand up under the fire of mod- 
ern competition. 

Unfortunately, it’s more than 
that. The themes are scholarly 
trivialities, pounced on with all 
the joy of a naturalist who has 
found an ancient skeleton — and 
they are just as meatless. The 
characters are composed of the 
effluvium of Latin tomes. 

As editor, Boucher demands 
more of his writers. It’s regret- 
table that he can’t make the same 
demands on himself.

gredients of space opera on the 
grand scale and still manage to 
come up with a believably per-

Like her fine Star Man’s Son, 
this future adventure is viewed 



through the eyes of a youth, com- 
ing into manhood in a time when 
Earth is subject to Galactic Em- 
pire rule, deemed too barbarous 
to deal with other civilizations, 
fit only to export mercenaries. 

A really good adventure. 

VENUS BOY by Lee Sutton. 
Lothrop, Lee 8s Sheperd Co., Inc., 
$2.50 

r I 'HIS month’s juvenile is so ex- 
citing that my kids grabbed 
it and fought over the piecas. I 
didn’t get a chance to read it un- 
til just now. As you can see, it 
has appeal. It also has lessons to 
teach, both moral and scientific. 
But it doesn’t permit them to get 
in the way of the story, which 
concerns a boy and his pet, a na- 
tive bear cub whose species’ curse 
is that their claws become jewels 
at maturity. Plastics treated with 
this material acquire fantastic 
properties. Johnny’^ attempt to 
hide his pet’s maturity and his 
acceptance as equal by the fauna 
of Venus make splendid reading 
for any kid my age.

The Snare 



By RICHARD R. SMITH 



It's easy to find a solution 
when there is one— the trick 
is to do it if there is none! 



1 GLANCED AT the path we 
had made across the Mare 
Serenitatis. The Latin trans- 
lated as “the Sea of Serenity.” It 
was well named because, as far 
as the eye could see in every di- 
rection, there was a smooth layer 
of pumice that resembled the sur- 
face of a calm sea. Scattered 
across the quiet sea of virgin 
Moon dust were occasional islands 
of rock that jutted abruptly to- 
ward the infinity of stars above. 
Considering everything, our sur- 
roundings conveyed a sense of 



serenity like none I had ever 
felt. 

Our bounding path across the 
level expanse was clearly marked. 
Because of the light gravity, we 
had leaped high into the air with 
each step and every time we 
struck the ground, the impact 
had raised a cloud of dustlike 
pumice. Now the clouds of dust 
were slowly settling in the light 
gravity. 

Above us, the stars were cold, 
motionless and crystal-clear. In- 
differently, they sprayed a faint

light on our surroundings ... a 
dim glow that was hardly suffi- 
cient for normal vision and was 
too weak to be reflected toward 
Earth. 

We turned our head-lamps on 
the strange object before us. Five 
beams of light illuminated the 
smooth shape that protruded 
from the Moon’s surface. 

The incongruity was so awe- 
some that for several minutes, we 
remained motionless and quiet. 
Miller broke the silence with 
his quavering voice, “Strange 
someone didn’t notice it before.” 

CTRANGE? THE object rose 
^ a quarter of a mile above us, 
a huge, curving hulk of smooth 
metal. It was featureless and yet 
conveyed a sense of alienness. It 
was alien and yet it wasn’t a na- 
tural formation. Something had 
made the thing, whatever it was. 
But was it strange that it hadn’t 
been noticed before? Men had 
lived on the Moon for over a year, 
but the Moon was vast and the 
Mare Serenitatis covered three 
hundred and forty thousand 
square miles. 

“What is it?” Marie asked 
breathlessly. 

Her husband grunted his baf- 
flement. “Who knows? But see 
how it curves? If it’s a perfect 
sphere, it must be at least two 
miles in diameter!” 

“If it’s a perfect sphere,” Miller 



suggested, “most of it must be 
beneath the Moon’s surface.” 

“Maybe it isn’t a sphere,” my 
wife said. “Maybe this is all of it.” 

“Let’s call Lunar City and tell 
the authorities about it.” I 
reached for the radio controls on 
my suit. 

Kane grabbed my arm. “No. 
Let’s find out whatever we can by 
ourselves. If we tell the authori- 
ties, they’ll order us to leave it 
alone. If we discover something 
really important, we’ll be fa- 
mous!” 

I lowered my arm. His outburst 
seemed faintly childish to me. 
And yet it carried a good measure 
of common sense. If we discov- 
ered proof of an alien race, we 
would indeed be famous. The 
more we discovered for ourselves, 
the more famous we’d be. Fame 
was practically a synonym for 
prestige and wealth. 

“All right,” I conceded. 

Miller stepped forward, mov- 
ing slowly in the bulk of his 
spacesuit. Deliberately, he re- 
moved a small torch from his side 
and pressed the brilliant flame 
against the metal. 

A few minutes later, the elderly 
mineralogist gave his opinion: 
“It’s steel . made thousands of 
years ago.” 

Someone gasped over the inter- 
com, “Thousands of years! But 
wouldn’t it be in worse shape than 
this if it was that old?” 



THE SNARE 



95 



Miller pointed at the small cut 
his torch had made in the metal. 
The notch was only a quarter 
of an inch deep. “I say steel be- 
cause it’s similar to steel. Actu- 
ally, it’s a much stronger alloy. 
Besides that, on the Moon, there’s 
been no water or atmosphere to 
rust it. Not even a wind to dis- 
turb its surface. It’s at least sev- 
eral thousand years old.” 

W E SLOWLY circled the alien 
structure. Several minutes 
later, Kane shouted, “Look!” 

A few feet above the ground, 
the structure’s smooth surface was 
broken by a circular opening that 
yawned invitingly. Kane ran 
ahead and flashed his head-lamp 
into the dark recess. 

“There’s a small room inside,” 
he told us, and climbed through 
the opening. 

We waited outside and focused 
our lamps through the five-foot 
opening to give him as much 
light as possible. 

“Come on in, Marie,” he called 
to his wife. “This is really some- 
thing! It must be an alien race. 
There’s all kinds of weird draw- 
ings on the walls and gadgets that 
look like controls for some- 
thing . .” 

Briefly, my lamp flickered over 
Marie’s pale face. Her features 
struggled with two conflicting 
emotions: She was frightened by 
the alienness of the thing and 

96 



yet she wanted to be with her 
husband. She hesitated momen- 
tarily, then climbed through the 
passage. 

“You want to go in?” my wife 
asked. 

“Do you?” 

“Let’s.” 

I helped Verana through the 
opening, climbed through myself 
and turned to help Miller. 

Miller was sixty years old. He 
was an excellent mineralogist, 
alert mentally, but with a body 
that was almost feeble. I reached 
out to help him as he stepped 
into the passageway. 

For a brief second, he was 
framed in the opening, a dark 
silhouette against the star-stud- 
ded sky. 

The next second, he was 
thrown twenty yards into the air. 
He gasped with pain when he 
struck the ground. “Something 
pushed me!” 

“Are you all right?” 

“Yes.” 

He had fallen on a spot beyond 
our angle of vision. I started 
through the passage . 

. and struck an invisible 
solid wall. 

1%/TY EYES were on the circu- 
-L” lar opening. A metal panel 
emerged from a recess on one 
side and slid across the passage. 
The room darkened with the ab- 
sence of starlight. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“What happened?” 

“The door to this damned place 
closed,” I explained. 

“What?” 

Before we could recover from 
the shock, the room filled with a 
brilliant glare. We turned off our 
lamps. 

The room was approximately 
twelve feet long and nine feet 
wide. The ceiling was only a few 
inches above our heads and when 
I looked at the smooth, hard 
metal, I felt as if I were trapped 
in some alien vault. 

The walls of the room were 
covered with strange drawings 
and instruments. Here and there, 
kaleidoscopic lights pulsed rhy- 
thmically. 

Kane brushed past me and beat 
his gloved fists against the metal 
door that had imprisoned us. 

“Miller!” 

“Yes?” 

“See if you can get this thing 
open from the outside.” 

I knelt before the door and 
explored its surface with my fin- 
gers. There were no visible re- 
cesses or controls. 

Over the intercom network, 
everyone’s breath mingled and 
formed a rough, harsh sound. I 
could discern the women’s quick, 
frightened breaths that were al- 
most sobs. Kane’s breath was 
deep and strong; Miller’s was fal- 
tering and weak. 

“Miller, get help!” 



“I’ll — ” The sound of his 
breathing ceased. We listened 
intently. 

“What happened to him?” 

“I’ll phone Lunar City.” My 
fingers fumbled at the radio con- 
trols and trembled beneath the 
thick gloves. 

I turned the dials that would 
connect my radio with Lunar 
City . 

Static grated against my ear 
drums. 

Static! 

T LISTENED TO the harsh, er- 

ratic sound and my voice was 
weak by comparison: “Calling 

Lunar City.” 

“Static!” Kane echoed my 
thoughts. His frown made deep 
clefts between his eyebrows. 
“There’s no static between inter- 
lunar radio!” 

Verana’s voice was small and 
frightened. “That sounds like 
the static we hear over the bigger 
radios when we broadcast to 
Earth.” 

“It does,” Marie agreed. 

“But we wouldn’t have that 
kind of static over our radio, 
unless — ” Verana’s eyes widened 
until the pupils were surrounded 
by circles of white — “unless we 
were in outer space!” 

We stared at the metal door 
that had imprisoned us, afraid 
even to speak of our fantastic 
suspicion.

I deactivated my radio. 

Marie screamed as an inner 
door opened to disclose a long, 
narrow corridor beyond. 

Simultaneous with the open- 
ing of the second door, I felt air 
press against my spacesuit. Be- 
fore, our suits had been puffed 
outward by the pressure of air 
inside. Now our spacesuits were 
slack and dangling on our bodies. 

We looked at each other and 
then at the inviting corridor be- 
yond the open door. 

We went single file, first Kane, 
then his wife Marie. Verana fol- 
lowed next and I was the last. 

We walked slowly, examining, 
the strange construction. The 
walls were featureless but still 
seemed alien. At various places 
on the walls were the outlines 
of doors without handles or locks. 

Kane pressed his shoulder 
against a door and shoved. The 
door was unyielding. 

I manipulated the air-vent con- 
trols of my spacesuit, allowed a 
small amount of the corridor’s air 
into my helmet and inhaled cau- 
tiously. It smelled all right. I 
waited and nothing happened. 
Gradually, I increased the intake, 
turned off the oxygenating ma- 
chines and removed my helmet. 

“Shut off your oxy,” I sug- 
gested. “We might as well breathe 
the air in this place and save our 
supply. We may need the oxygen 
in our suits later.” 



They saw that I had removed 
my helmet and was still alive and 
one by one removed their own 
helmets. 

A T THE END of the corridor, 
Kane stopped before a blank 
wall. The sweat on his face glis- 
tened dully; his chest rose and 
fell rapidly. Kane was a pilot and 
one of the prerequisites for the 
job of guiding tons of metal be- 
tween Earth and the Moon was a 
good set of nerves. Kane excited 
easily, his temper was firy, but 
his nerves were like steel. 

“The end of the line,” he 
grunted. 

As though to disprove the state- 
ment, a door on his right side 
opened soundlessly. 

He went through the doorway 
as if shoved violently by an in- 
visible hand. 

The door closed behind him. 

Marie threw herself at the 
door and beat at the metal. 
“Harry!” 

Verana rushed to her side. 
Another door on the opposite side 
of the corridor opened silently. 
The door was behind them; they 
didn’t notice. 

Before I could warn them, Ma- 
rie floated across the corridor, 
through the doorway. 

Verana and I stared at the 
darkness beyond the opening, our 
muscles frozen by shock. 

The door closed behind Marie’s

screaming, struggling form. 

Verana’s face was white with 
fear. Apprehensively, she glanced 
at the other doors that lined the 
hall. 

I put my arms around her, held 
her close. 

“Antigravity machines, force 
rays,” I suggested worriedly. 

For several minutes, we re- 
mained motionless and silent. I 
recalled the preceding events of 
the day, searched for a sense of 
normality in them. The Kanes, 
Miller, Verana and I lived in Lu- 
nar City with hundreds of other 
people. Mankind had inhabited 
the Moon for over a year. Means 
of recreation were scarce. Many 
people explored the place to 
amuse themselves. After supper, 
we had decided to take a walk. 
As simple as that: a walk on the 
Moon. 

We had expected only the fa- 
miliar craters, chasms and weird 
rock formations. A twist of fate 
and here we were: imprisoned in 
an alien ship. 

My legs quivered with fatigue, 
my heart throbbed heavily, Ver- 
ana’s perfume dizzied me. No, it 
wasn’t a dream. Despite our in- 
credible situation, there was no 
sensation of unreality. 

T TOOK VERANA’S hand and 

led her down the long corridor, 
retracing our steps. 

We had walked not more than 

100 



two yards when the rest of the 
doors opened soundlessly. 

Verana’s hand flew to her 
mouth to stifle a gasp. 

Six doors were now open. The 
only two that remained closed 
were the ones that the Kanes had 
unwillingly entered. 

This time, no invisible hand 
thrust us into any of the rooms. 

I entered the nearest one. Ver- 
ana followed hesitantly. 
j The walls of the large room 
were lined with shelves contain- 
ing thousands of variously colored 
boxes and bottles. A table and 
four chairs were located in the 
center of the green, plasticlike 
floor. Each chair had no back, 
only a curving platform with a 
single supporting column. 

“Ed!” I joined Verana on the 
other side of the room. She 
pointed a trembling finger at 
some crude drawings. “The things 
in this room are food!” 

The drawings were so simple 
that anyone could have under- 
stood them. The first drawing por- 
trayed a naked man and woman 
removing boxes and bottles from 
the shelves. The second picture 
showed the couple opening the 
containers. The third showed the 
man eating from one of the boxes 
and the woman drinking from a 
bottle. 

“Let’s see how it tastes,” I 
said. 

I selected an orange-colored 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



box. The lid dissolved at the 
touch of my fingers. 

The only contents were small 
cubes of a soft orange substance. 
I tasted a small piece. 
“Chocolate! Just like choco- 
late!” 

Verana chose a nearby bottle 
and drank some of the bluish li- 
quid. 

“Milk!” she exclaimed. 

“Perhaps we’d better look at 
the other rooms,” I told her. 

T HE NEXT room we exam- 
ined was obviously for rec- 
reation. Containers were filled 
with dozens of strange games and 
books of instructions in the form 
of simple drawings. The games 
were foreign, but designed in 
such a fashion that they would be 
interesting to Earthmen. 

Two of the rooms were sleep- 
ing quarters. The floors were cov- 
ered with a spongy substance and 
the lights were dim and soothing. 

Another room contained a 
small bathing pool, running water, 
waste-disposal units and yellow 
cakes of soap. 

The last room was an observa- 
tory. The ceiling and an entire 
wall were transparent. Outside, 
the stars shone clearly for a few 
seconds, then disappeared for an 
equal time, only to reappear in 
a different position. 

“Hyper-space drive,” Verana 
whispered softly. She was fasci- 

THE SNARE 



nated by the movement of the 
stars. For years, our scientists had 
sought a hyperspatial drive to 
conquer the stars. 

We selected a comfortable 
chair facing the transparent wall, 
lit cigarettes and waited. 

A few minutes lat,er, Marie en- 
tered the room. 

I noticed with some surprise 
that her face was calm. If she was 
excited, her actions didn’t betray 
it. 

She sat next to Verana. 

“What happened?” my wife 
asked. 

Marie crossed her legs and be- 
gan in a rambling manner as if 
discussing a new recipe, “That was 
really a surprise, wasn’t it? I was 
scared silly, at first. That room 
was dark and I didn’t know what 
to expect. Something touched my 
head and I heard a telepathic 
voice — ” 

“Telepathic?” Verana inter- 
rupted. 

“Yes. Well, this voice said not 
to worry and that it wasn’t going 
to hurt me. It said it only wanted 
to learn something about us. It 
was the oddest feeling! All the 
time, this voice kept talking to 
me in a nice way and made me 
feel at ease . and at the same 
time, I felt something search my 
mind and gather information. I 
could actually feel it search my 
memories!” 

“What memories?” I inquired. 

101 



-t 



She frowned with concentra- 
tion. “Memories of high school 
mostly. It seemed interested in 
English and history classes. And 
then it searched for memories of 
our customs and lives in gen- 
eral . .” 

TZ'ANE STALKED into the 
room at that moment, his 
face red with anger. “Do you 
know where we are?” he de- 
manded. “When those damned 
aliens got me in that room, they 
explained what this is all about. 
We’re guinea pigs!” 

“Did they use telepathy to ex- 
plain?” Verana asked. I suddenly 
remembered that she was a mem- 
ber of a club that investigated 
extra-sensory perception with the 
hope of learning how it operated. 
She was probably sorry she had- 
n’t been contacted telepathically. 

“Yeah,” Kane replied. “I saw 
all sorts of mental pictures and 
they explained what they did to 
us. Those damned aliens want us 
for their zoo!” 

“Start at the beginning,” I sug- 
gested. 

He flashed an angry glance at 
me, but seemed to calm some- 
what. “This ship was made by a 
race from another galaxy. Thou- 
sands of years ago, they came to 
Earth in their spaceships when 
men were primitives living in 
caves. They wanted to know 
what our civilization would be 

102 



like when we developed space 
flight. So they put this ship on 
the Moon as a sort of booby-trap. 
They put it there with the idea 
that when we made spaceships 
and went to the Moon, sooner or 
later, we’d find the ship and enter 
it — like rabbits in a snare!” 

“And now the booby-trap is on 
its way home,” I guessed. 

“Yeah, this ship is taking us to 
their planet and they’re going to 
keep us there while they study 
us.” 

“How long will the trip take?” 
I asked. 

“Six months. We’ll be bottled 
up in this crate for six whole 
damned months! And when we 
get there, we’ll be prisoners!” 
Marie’s hypnotic spell was fad- 
ing and once more her face 
showed the terror inside her. 

“Don’t feel so bad,” I told 
Kane. “It could be worse. It should 
be interesting to see an alien race. 
We’ll have our wives with us — ” 
“Maybe they’ll dissect us!” 
Marie gasped. 

Verana scoffed. “A race intel- 
ligent enough to build a ship like 
this? A race that was traveling 
between the stars when we were 
living in caves? Dissection is pri- 
mitive. They won’t have to dissect 
us in order to study us. They’ll 
have more advanced methods.” 
“Maybe we can reach the 
ship’s controls somehow,” Kane 
said excitedly. “We’ve got to try 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to change the ship’s course and 
get back to the Moon!” 

“It’s impossible. Don’t waste 
your time.” The voice had no 
visible source and seemed to fill 
the room. 

T/ERANA SNAPPED her fin- 
' gers. “So that’s why the aliens 
read Marie’s mind! They wanted 
to learn our language so they 
could talk to us!” 

Kane whirled in a complete 
circle, glaring at each of the four 
walls. “Where are you? Who are 
you?” 

“I’m located in a part of the 
ship you can’t reach. I’m a ma- 
chine.” 

“Is anyone else aboard besides 
ourselves?” 

“No. I control the ship.” Al- 
though the voice spoke without 
stilted phrases, the tone was cold 
and mechanical. 

“What are your — your mas- 
ters going to do wiith us?” Marie 
asked anxiously. 

“You won’t be harmed. My 
masters merely wish to question 
and examine you. Thousands of 
years ago, they wondered what 
your race would be like when it 
developed to the space-flight 
i stage. Thy left this ship on your 
Moon only because they were 
curious. My masters have no ani- 
mosity toward your race, only 
compassion and curiosity.” 

I remembered the way anti- 



gravity rays had shoved Miller 
from the ship and asked the ma- 
chine, “Why didn’t you let our 
fifth member board the ship?” 

“The trip to my makers’ planet 
will take six months. There are 
food, oxygen and living facilities 
for four only of your race. I had 
to prevent the fifth from entering 
the ship.” 

“Come on,” Kane ordered. 
“We’ll search this ship room by 
room and we’ll find some way to 
make it take us back to Earth.” 

“It’s useless,” the ship warned 
us. 

For five hours, we minutely ex- 
amined every room. We had no 
tools to force our way through 
solid metal walls to the engine 
or control rooms. The only things 
in the ship that could be lifted 
and carried about were the con- 
tainers of food and alien games. 
None were sufficiently heavy or 
hard enough to put even a scratch 
in the heavy metal. 

CIX ROOMS were open to our 
^ use. The two rooms in which 
the Kanes had been imprisoned 
were locked and there were no 
controls or locks to work on. 

The rooms that we could enter 
were without doors, except the 
ones that opened into the corri- 
dor. 

After intensive searching, we 
realized there was no way to da- 
mage the ship or reach any sec- 



THE SNARE 



103 



tion other than our alloted space. 

We gave up. 

The women went to the sleep- 
ing compartments to rest and 
Kane I went to the “kitchen.” 

At random, we sampled the va- 
riously colored boxes and bottles 
and discussed our predicament. 

“Trapped,” Kane said angrily. 
“Trapped in a steel prison.” He 
slammed his fist against the table 
top. “But there must be a way 
to get out! Every problem has a 
solution!” 

“You sure?” I asked. 

“What?” 

“Does every problem have a 
solution? I don’t believe it. Some 
problems are too great. Take the 
problem of a murderer in our ci- 
vilization: John Doe has killed 
someone and his problem is to 
escape. Primarily, a murderer’s 
problem is the same principle as 
ours. A murderer has to outwit an 
entire civilization. We have to 
outwit an entire civilization that 
was hundreds of times more ad- 
vanced than ours is now when we 
were clubbing animals and eating 
the meat raw. Damned few crim- 
inals get away these days, even 
though they’ve got such crowds 
to lose themselves in. All we have 
is a ship that we can’t control. I 
don’t think we have a chance.” 

My resignation annoyed him. 
Each of us had reacted differ- 
ently: Kane’s wife was frightened, 
Verana was calm because of an 



inner serenity that few people 
have, I was resigned and Kane 
was angry. 

OR SEVERAL minutes, we 
sampled the different foods. 
Every one had a distinctive flavor, 
comparable to that of a fruit or 
vegetable on Earth. 

Kane lifted a brown bottle to 
his lips, took a huge gulp and al- 
most choked. 

“Whiskey!” 

“My masters realized your 
race would develop intoxicants 
and tried to create a comparable 
one,” the machine explained. 

I selected a brown bottle and 
sampled the liquid. “A little 
stronger than our own,” I in- 
formed the machine. 

We drank until Kane was stag- 
gering about the room, shouting 
insults at the alien race and the 
mechanical voice that seemed to 
be everywhere. He beat his fist 
against a wall until blood trickled 
from bruised knuckles. 

“Please don’t hurt yourself,” 
the machine pleaded. 

“Why?” Kane screamed at the 
ceiling. “Why should you care?” 
“My masters will be displeased 
with me if you arrive in a dam- 
aged condition.” 

Kane banged his head against 
a bulkhead; an ugly bruise formed 
rapidly. “Shtop me, then!” 

“I can’t. My masters created no 
way for me to restrain or contact 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you other than use of your lan- 
guage.” 

It took fully fifteen minutes to 
drag Kane to his sleeping com- 
partment. 

After I left Kane in his wife’s 
care, I went to the adjoining room 
and stretched out on the soft floor 
beside Verana. 

I tried to think of some solu- 
tion. We were locked in an alien 
ship at the start of a six months’ 
journey to a strange planet. We 
had no tools or weapons. 

Solution? I doubted if two 
dozen geniuses working steadily 
for years could think of one! 

I wondered what the alien race 
was like. Intelligent, surely: They 
had foreseen our conquest of space 
flight when we hadn’t even in- 
vented the wheel. That thought 
awed me — somehow they had 
analyzed our brains thousands of 
years ago and calculated what our 
future accomplishments would be. 

They had been able to predict 
our scientific development, but 
they hadn’t been able to tell how 
our civilization would develop. 
They were curious, so they had 
left an' enormously elaborate piece 
of bait on the Moon. 

The aliens were incredibly 
more advanced than ourselves. I 
couldn’t help thinking, And to a 
rabbit in a snare, mankind must 
seem impossibly clever. 

I decided to ask the machine 
about its makers in the “morning.” 



YV7HEN I awoke, my head was 
** throbbing painfully. 

I opened my eyes and blinked 
several times to make sure they 
were functioning properly. I 
wasn’t in the compartment where 
I had fallen asleep a few hours 
before. 

I was tied to one of the chairs 
in the “kitchen.” Beside me, Ver- 
ana was bound to a chair by 
strips of cloth from her skirt, and 
across from us, Marie was secured 
to another chair. 

Kane staggered into the room. 
Although he was visibly drunk, 
he appeared more sober than the 
night before. His dark hair was 
rumpled and his face was flushed, 
but his eyes gleamed with a grow- 
ing alertness. * 

“Awake, huh?” 

“What have you done, Harry?” 
his wife screamed at him. Her 
eyes were red with tears and her 
lips twisted in an expression of 
shame when she looked at him. 

“Obvious, isn’t it? While all of 
you were asleep, I conked each 
of you on the head, dragged you 
in here and tied you up.” He 
smiled crookedly. “It’s amazing 
the things a person can do when 
he’s pickled. I’m sorry I had to be 
so rough, but I have a plan and 
I knew you wouldn’t agree or 
cooperate with me.” 

“What’s your plan?” I asked. 

He grinned wryly and crinkled 
bloodshot eyes. “I don’t want to 



THE SNARE 



105 



live in a zoo on an alien planet. I 
want to go home and prove my 
theory that this problem has a 
solution.” 

I grunted my disgust. 

“The solution is simple,” he 
said. “We’re in a trap so strong 
that the aliens didn’t establish 
any means to control our actions. 
When men put a lion in a strong 
cage, they don’t worry about con- 
trolling the lion because the lion 
can’t get out. We’re in the same 
basic situation.” 

“So what?” Verana queried in 
a sarcastic tone. 

“The aliens want us trans- 
ported to their planet so they can 
examine and question us. Right?” 
“Right.” 

“Ed, remember that remark the 
machine made last night?” 
“What remark?” 

“It said, ‘My masters will be 
displeased with me if you arrive 
in a damaged condition.’ What 
does that indicate to you?” 

I ASSUMED A baffled expres- 
sion. I didn’t have the slight- 
est idea of what he was driving 
at and I told him so. 

“Ed,” he said, “if you could 
build an electronic brain capable 
of making decisions, how would 
you build it?” 

“Hell, I don’t know,” I confes- 
sed. 

“Well, if I could build an elec- 
tronic brain like the one running 

106 



this ship, I’d build it with a con- 
science so it’d do its best at all 
times.” 

“Machines always do their 
best,” I argued. “Come on, untie 
us. I’m getting a crick in my 
back!” I didn’t like the idea of 
being slugged while asleep. If 
Kane had been sober and if his 
wife hadn’t been present, I 
would have let him know exactly 
what I thought of him. 

“Out machines always do their 
best,” he argued, “because we 
punch buttons and they respond 
in predetermined patterns. But 
the electronic brain in this ship 
isn’t automatic. It makes deci- 
sions and I’ll bet it even has to 
decide how much energy and time 
to put into each process!” 

“So what?” 

He shrugged muscular shoul- 
ders. “So this ship is operated by 
a thinking, conscientious machine. 
It’s the first time I’ve encoun- 
tered such a machine, but I think 
I know what will happen. I spent 
hours last night figuring — ” 
“What are you talking about?” 
I interrupted. “Are you so drunk 
that you don’t know — ” 

“I’ll show you, Ed.” 

He walked around the table 
and stood behind my chair. I felt 
his thick fingers around my throat 
and smelled the alcohol on his 
breath. 

“Can you see me, machine?” 
he asked the empty air. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Yes,” the electronic brain re- 
plied. 

“Watch!” 

Kane tightened his fingers 
around my throat. 

Verana and Marie screamed 
shrilly. 

My head seemed to swell like 
a balloon; my throat gurgled pain- 
fully. 

“Please stop,” the machine 
pleaded. 

“What will your masters think 
of you if I kill all of us? You’ll 
return to them with a cargo of 
dead people!” 

HTHE MACHINE didn’t answer. 

I waited for the electronic 
brain to interfere and, with a 
cold knot in my stomach, realized 
the machine had said it had no 
way to control our actions! 

“Your purpose won’t be ful- 
filled, will it?” Kane demanded. 
“Not if you return with dead spe- 
cimens!” 

“No,” the machine admitted. 

“If you don’t take us back to 
the Moon,” Kane threatened, “I’ll 
kill all of us!" 

The alien electronic brain was 
silent. 

By this time, I couldn’t see and 
Kane’s voice was a hollow, far- 
away thing that rang in my ears. 



I tugged at my bindings, but they 
only tightened as I struggled. 

“If you take us back to the 
Moon, your masters will never 
know you failed in your mission. 
They won’t know you failed be- 
cause you won’t bring them proof 
of your failure.” 

My fading consciousness tried 
to envision the alien mechanical 
brain as it struggled with the 
problem. 

“Look at it this way,” Kane 
persisted. “If you carry our 
corpses to your masters, all your 
efforts will have been useless. If 
you return us to the Moon alive, 
you’ll still have a chance to car- 
ry out your mission later.” 

A long silence followed. Verana 
and Marie screamed at Kane to 
let go. A soft darkness seemed to 
fill the room, blurring everything, 
drowning even their shrieks in 
strangling blackness. 

“You win,” the machine con- 
ceded. “I’ll return the ship to the 
Moon.” 

Kane released his grip on my 
throat. 

“See?” he asked. “Didn’t I tell 
you every problem has a solu- 
tion?” 

I didn’t answer. I was too busy 
enjoying breathing again.

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




SYNOPSIS 

A lan Commager accom- 
panies his friend Jean 
Bohart to the home of 
Herbert Hawkes in Beverly 
Hills, with the intention of “res- 
cuing” Jean’s impressionable 
husband Ira Bohart from the 
influence of a mysterious meta- 
physical group called the Guides. 
Commager is amused at Ira’s be- 
lief that Commager himself has 
recently demonstrated psi abili- 
ties that will be of interest to 
the Guides. 

At Hawkes’s home, they meet 
a small group of people. To prove 
to Ira that the Guides are frauds, 
Commager submits to a series of 
experiments conducted by an at- 
tractive young woman called 
Paylar. He blacks out and dis- 
covers himself presently sitting 
in his store, much later in the 
night, with no recollection of how 
he got there. Also in the store 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



109 




is the dead body of Ruth Mac- 
Donald whom he had met at 
Hawkes’s home. Commager de- 
cides the Guides are out to frame 
him for interfering in their busi- 
ness with Ira. He leaves Ruth’s 
body in the garden back of 
Hawkes’s house. 

Early next morning, Com- 
mager learns through a phone 
call from Jean Bohart that the 
Boharts are unaware of anything 
unusual having occurred during 
the experiments the night before, 
but that they left the party be- 
fore he did. Unable to be really 
certain that he didn’t kill Ruth 
MacDonald during the period of 
amnesia, Commager calls on Dr. 
Henry L. Warbutt, his one-time 
guardian and psychologist. War- 
butt tells him that among the 
local fringe groups the Guides 
are reputed to have genuine 
metaphysical powers and that 
they are probably a good group 
to avoid. 

Commager calls next on an- 
other friend, a professional hyp- 
notist, Julius Savage. He relives 
a period of his life, four years 
back, when he became interested 
in the psi experiments of his 
wife, Lona, who was killed short- 
ly afterward in an automobile 
crash. Julius startles him by tell- 
ing him that he never had a wife 
and that his memories of her are 
a delusion. 

Paylar meets him that night 

110 



and explains that the Guides are 
an organization devoted to pre- 
venting the development of para- 
psychological abilities in human 
beings. Commager, she says, is in 
the process of developing such 
abilities to a dangerous extent. 
The Guides will use all available 
means to “stop’’ him. Commager 
is skeptical, but is badly jolted 
again when he notices that the 
driver of Paylar’s car is Ruth 
MacDonald, now very much 
alive again. In spite of Paylar’s 
warning, he has no intention of 
joining the Guides. 

The following morning, Com- 
mager receives a call from a 
Mrs. Elaine Lovelock, an as- 
sistant of Dr. Wilson Knox, 
who was present at the meeting 
at Hawkes’s house and who is 
the head of a local pseudo-reli- 
gious cult. Dr. Knox has had a 
heart attack during the night and 
pleads for Commager's help. 
Commager goes to see Knox who 
tells him the heart attack is a 
punishment for having resisted 
Ruth MacDonald’s attempt to 
assume control of his cult and 
that the Guides will kill him un- 
less Commager grants him his 
“protection.” Commager, accord- 
ing to Knox, has abilities of which 
the Guides are afraid. 

Commager decides to humor 
Knox to the extent of phoning 
Paylar and telling her that Ruth 
is to leave Knox alone. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



A little later, Commager gets 
another message from Mrs. Love- 
lock: Dr. Knox has just died. 
Within halt an hour, Commager 
finds himself suffering from some- 
thing remarkably like a heart 
attack himself. 

S OME thirty minutes later, the 
first hot jolt of pain drove 
down from the center of Com- 
mager’s throat to a point under 
the end of his breast-bone. 

If it hadn’t been so damned 
pat, he thought, he might have 
yelled for a doctor. The sensa- 
tions were thoroughly convinc- 
ing. 

There was a section at the back 
of the store devoted to the ex- 
perimental breeding of fish that 
were priced high enough to make 
such domestic arrangements 
worthwhile and exceptionally 
delicate in their requirements for 
propagation. The section had a 
door -that could be locked, to 
avoid disturbances. Commager 
went in and locked it. 

In the swampy, hot-house at- 
mosphere, he leaned against one 
of the tank racks, breathing care- 
fully. The pain was still there, 
much less substantial than it had 
been in the first few moments, 
but still a vertical, hard cramp- 
ing inside his chest. It had 
shocked him — it did yet — but 
he was not nearly so much 
alarmed as angry. 



The anger raged against him- 
self — he was doing this! The 
suggestion to do it might have 
been implanted, but the response 
wasn’t an enemy from outside, a 
phantom tiger pressing cold, 
steely claws down through his 
chest. It was a self-generated 
thing that used his own muscles, 
his own nerves, his own brain — 

It tightened suddenly again. 
Steel-hard, chilling pain, along 
with a bitter, black, strangling 
nausea in his throat. “I’m doing 
it!” he thought. 

The clamping agony was part 
of himself; he had created it, 
structured it, was holding it there 
now. 

A ND SO HE relaxed it again. 

Not easily, because the other 
side of himself, the hidden, un- 
aware, responsive side was being 
stubborn about this! It knew it 
was supposed to die now, and it 
did its determined best. 

But degree by degree, he re- 
laxed the cramping, the tightness, 
and then suddenly felt it dissolve 
completely. 

Commager stood, his legs 
spread apart, swaying a little 
drunkenly. Sweat ran from his 
body. His head remained cocked 
to the right as if listening, sens- 
ing, while he breathed in long, 
harsh gasps that slowed gradu- 
ally. 

It was gone. 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



111 



And now, he thought, let’s 
really test this thing! Let’s pro- 
duce it again. 

That wasn’t easy either, be- 
cause he kept cringing in fear of 
its return. 

But he produced it. 

And, this time, it wasn’t too 
hard to let it go, let it dissolve 
again. 

He brought it up briefly once 
more, a single sharp stab — and 
washed it away. 

And that, he thought, was 
enough of that kind of game. 
He’d proved his point! 

He stripped off his shirt and 
hosed cold water over his head 
and shoulders and arms. He 
dabbed himself with a towel, put 
his wet shirt back on, combed 
his hair and went back to the 
office. 

Sitting there, he thought of an 
old gag about a moronic wrestler 
who, practicing holds and grips 
all by himself, broke off his left 
foot and remarked admiringly, 
“Jeez, boss, nobody but me could 
have done that to me, huh?” 

Which more or less covered 
what had happened. And now 
that he had made that quite clear, 
it seemed safe to wonder whether 
just possibly there mightn’t have 
been some direct, immediate 
prompting from outside — some- 
thing that told him to go ahead 
and break himself apart, just as 
the wrestler had done. 



’ I ' HOUGH there needn’t have 
been anything as direct as a 
telepathic suggestion. It could 
also have been done, quite as 
purposefully, by inducing the dis- 
turbed leaders of the Temple of 
Antique Christianity to bring 
their plight to his attention. By 
letting him become thoroughly 
aware of the shadowy, supersti- 
tious possibilities in the situation, 
opening his mind to them and 
their implications — and then 
hammering the suggestion home 
with the simple, indisputable fact 
of Wilson Knox’s death! 

If someone was clever enough 
to know Alan Commager a little 
better than he’d known himself 
so far — and had motive enough 
not to mind killing somebody 
else in order to soften him up — 
it could have been done in just 
that way. And Paylar had told 
him openly that the motive 
existed. 

Commager decided that that 
was how it had been done; though 
now he didn’t mind considering 
the possibility of a telepathic sug- 
gestion either. They might try 
something else, but he was quite 
sure that the kind of trick they 
had tried — whichever way it 
had been done — wouldn’t work 
at all another time. They needed 
his cooperation for that, and he 
wasn’t giving them any. 

And still, aside from the fact 
that Wilson Knox had been 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



threatened, nothing at all had 
occurred openly. 

The anger in him remained. 
He couldn’t bring himself to feel 
really sorry for Knox, or for 
Elaine Lovelock either. They 
were destructive mental parasites 
who’d had the bad luck to run 
into what might be simply a more 
efficient parasite of the same 
breed. In spite of their protests, 
they hadn’t been any less ruth- 
less with the people they con- 
trolled. 

He could recognize that. But 
the anger stayed with him, a 
smoldering and dangerous thing, 
a little ugly. Basically, Com- 
mager knew, he was still angry 
with himself. For reasons still un- 
known, he had developed an area 
of soft rot in his thoughts and 
emotions; and he was reasonably 
convinced that, without that 
much to start on, the proddings 
and nibblings of — parasites — 
couldn’t have had any effect. To 
have reduced himself to the level 
of becoming vulnerable to them 
seemed an intolerably indecent 
failing, like a filthy disease. 

But anger, however honestly 
directed where it belongs, wants 
to strike outward. 

OR A parasite or whatever 
else she might be, Paylar 
looked flatteringly beautiful in a 
sheath of silver and black — and 
he didn’t get a significant word 



out of her all evening. 

Commager hadn’t tried to talk 
shop, but he had expected that 
she would. However, in that re- 
spect, it might have been simply 
another interesting, enjoyable but 
not too extraordinary night out. 

In other respects, it wasn’t. He 
didn’t forget at any time that 
here was someone who probably 
shared the responsibility for what 
he was now rather certain had 
been, a deliberate murder. In re- 
trospect, her promise to tell Ruth 
MacDonald not to frighten Knox 
any more hadn’t meant anything, 
since Knox by then had been as 
good as dead. 

The odd thing — made much 
odder, of course, by the other 
probability that he himself had 
been the actual target of that 
killing — was that, as far as Pay- 
lar was concerned, he seemed un- 
able to feel any convincing moral 
indignation about the event! It 
was puzzling enough so that, 
under and around their pleasant 
but unimportant conversation, he 
was mainly engaged in hunting 
for the cause of that lack of 
feeling. 

Her physical attractiveness 
seemed involved in it somehow. 
Not as a justification for murder; 
he wasn’t even so sure this eve- 
ning that he liked Paylar physic- 
ally. He felt the attraction, but 
there was also a trace of some- 
thing not very far from revulsion 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



113 



in his involuntary response to it. 

It wasn’t too obvious; but she 
might have almost an excess of 
quiet vitality, a warmth and 
slender, soft earthiness that 
seemed almost more animal than 
human. 

That thought-line collapsed 
suddenly. Rather, it struck Com- 
mager, as if he’d been about to 
become aware of something he 
wasn’t yet prepared to see. 

TT E SUDDENLY laughed, and 
Paylar’s short black eye- 
brows lifted questioningly. 

“I just worked something out, 
Mabel!” he explained. He’d asked 
her earlier what her full name 
was, and she had told him gravely 
it was Mabel Jones, and that she 
used Paylar for business purposes 
only. He didn’t believe her, but, 
for the evening, they had settled 
cosily on Mabel and Alan. 

“The thing that’s different 
about you,” he went on, “is that 
you don’t have a soul! So, of 
course, you don’t have a human 
conscience either!” He considered 
a moment. It seemed, at any rate, 
to reflect almost exactly how he 
felt about her. A cat, say, was 
attractive, pleasant to see and 
to touch; and one didn’t blame 
a cat for the squawking bird it 
had killed that afternoon. One 
didn’t fairly blame a cat either 
if, to avenge some mysterious 
offense, it lashed out with a 

114 



taloned paw at oneself! He de- 
veloped the notion to Paylar as 
well as he could without violat- 
ing the rule against shop-talk. 

The cat-woman seemed neither 
amused nor annoyed at his de- 
scription of her. She listened at- 
tentively and then said, “You 
could still join us, Alan — ■” 

“Lady,” said Commager, aston- 
ished, “there are any number of 
less disagreeable suggestions you 
could have made at this hour!” 
He added, “Leaving out every- 
thing else, I don’t like the com- 
pany you keep.” 

Paylar shrugged naked tanned 
shoulders. Then her gaze went 
past him and froze briefly. 

“What’s the matter?” he in- 
quired. 

She looked back at him with 
a rueful smile. “I’m afraid you’re 
going to see a little more of my 
company now,” she remarked. 
“What time of night is it, Alan?” 

/^OMMAGER checked. It was 
just past midnight, he told 
her, so it wasn’t surprising that 
this and that should have started 
crawling out of the woodwork. 
He turned his head. 

“Hello, Oracle!” he said cordi- 
ally. “What do you see in the tea 
leaves for me?” 

Ruth MacDonald looked a 
little out of place here in a neat 
gray business suit. For a moment, 
she had also looked uncomfort- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ably like a resurrected corpse to 
Commager, but she was alive 
enough. 

She glanced at him. “I see your 
death,” she said unsmilingly. 

Commager told her that she 
appeared to be in a rut, but 
wouldn’t she sit down and have 
a drink? The ice-faced young 
siren didn’t share Paylar’s im- 
munity in his mind — she made 
his flesh crawl; she was some- 
thing that should be stepped on! 

Paylar stood up. “You’re fools,” 
she said to Ruth MacDonald 
without passion. She turned to 
Commager. “Alan, I should have 
told you I intended to drive back 
with Ruth — ” 

It was a lie, he thought, but 
he didn’t mind. The expression 
of implacable hostility on Ruth 
MacDonald’s face had been grati- 
fying — Paylar’s friends were 
becoming really unhappy about 
him! 

The gray car stood almost at 
the far end of the dark parking 
lot where he had left his own. 
He walked them up to it and 
wished them both good night 
with some solemnity. “You, too, 
Miss MacDonald!” he said, which 
gained him another brief glance 
and nothing more. Then he step- 
ped aside to let them back out. 

Vjf^HEN HE stopped moving, 
there was no particular psy- 
chic ability required to guess 



what was pushing against the 
back of his spine. “We’re taking 
the next car,” Herbert Hawkes’s 
voice announced gently behind 
him. “And I’m sure we can count 
on you to act reasonably this 
time, Mr, Commager!” 

It was rather neat, at that. The 
gray car was moving slowly away, 
racing its engine. If there had 
been anyone in sight at the mo- 
ment — but there wasn’t — a 
back-fire wouldn’t have created 
any particular excitement. 

“I’m a reasonable man,” Com- 
mager said meekly. “Good eve- 
ning, Mr. Barthold! I’m to take 
one of the back seats, I suppose?” 

“That’s what we had in mind,” 
Hawkes admitted. 

They might or might not be 
amateurs at this kind of thing, 
but they didn’t seem to be mak- 
ing any obvious mistakes. Lex 
Barthold was driving, and Com- 
mager sat in the seat behind him. 
Hawkes sat beside Barthold, half- 
turned toward Commager. The 
gun he held pointed at Com- 
mager’s chest lay along the top 
of the back-rest. From outside, 
if anyone happened to glance in, 
it would look as if the two of 
them were engaged in conversa- 
tion. 

Commager thought wistfully of 
his own gun, stacked uselessly 
away in his car. This was what 
came of starting to think in terms 
of modern witchcraft! One over- 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



115 



looked the simple solutions. 

“I was wondering,” he suggest- 
ed, “what would happen if we 
passed a patrol-car.” 

Hawkes shrugged very slightly. 
“You might try praying that we 
do, Commager!” 

W HETHER the possibility 
was bothering him or not, 
the big man didn’t look happy. 
And there was a set tension about 
the way Lex Barthold drove 
which indicated an equal lack of 
enjoyment there. Witchcraft ad- 
dicts themselves, they might feel 
that physical mayhem, if that 
was what they were contemplat- 
ing, was a little out of their nor- 
mal lines of activity. 

Otherwise, they had brawn 
enough for almost any kind of 
mayhem, and while one needn’t 
assume immediately that the trip 
was to wind up with outright 
murder, their attitude wasn’t re- 
assuring. 

Meanwhile, he had been fas- 
cinated by the discovery that 
Hawkes sported a large, discol- 
ored bruise at the exact points of 
his neck and jaw where Com- 
mager had thought his fist had 
landed early Monday morning. 
Those “hallucinations” hadn’t 
been entirely illusory, after all! 

However, that made it a little 
harder again to understand what 
actually could have happened 
that night. Commager’s thoughts 

116 



started darting off after rather 
improbable explanations, such as 
the possibility of Ruth MacDon- 
ald’s having a twin sister or a 
close double who had been sacri- 
ficed then — much as Knox had 
been — as part of the plot to 
drive Alan Commager out of his 
mind or into his grave! He shook 
his head. It just didn’t seem very 
likely. 

The one thing he could be sure 
of right now was that Hawkes, 
who mightn’t be the most genial 
of men at best, hadn’t appreciated 
that sneak punch. 

They didn’t pass any patrol- 
cars. 

IX 

TTE KILLED Herbert Hawkes 
not a quarter of a mile away 
from his own Bayside cabin. The 
location wasn’t accidental. Once 
they were past the point of pos- 
sible interference, with the last 
fifty yards of a twisting, precipi- 
tous goat-path down to the Bay 
behind Commager and a gun still 
in front of him, Hawkes took time 
out to explain. 

“We’re counting on your being 
found,” he said, “and this is your 
own backyard, so to speak. 
You’ve gone fishing now and then 
from that spot down there, Com- 
mager. Tonight, being a little 
liquored up, you decided to go 
for a swim. Or you slipped and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fell from all the way up here and 
died instantly.” 

Commager looked at the gun. 
“With a couple of bullets in me?” 

“I don’t think it will come to 
that.” Both of them, in spite of 
Hawkes’s bland analysis of the 
situation, were still as nervous, 
Commager suspected, as a couple 
of cats in a strange cellar. “But 
if it does — well, you ran into 
a couple of rough characters out 
here, and they shot you and 
threw you in! Of course, we’d 
prefer to avoid that kind of com- 
plication.” 

He paused as if expecting some 
comment. They both stood about 
eight feet away, looking at Com- 
mager. 

The Moon was low over the 
Bay, but it was big, and there 
was plenty of light for close- 
range shooting. This was a lumpy 
shelf of rock, not more than 
twenty by twenty feet, long and 
wide; the path dropped off to 
the right of it to another smaller 
shelf and ended presently at the 
water’s edge, where there was a 
wet patch of sand when the tide 
was out. 

The only way up from here 
was the path they’d come down 
by, and the two stood in front 
of that. He couldn’t read Bart- 
hold’s expression just now, but 
Hawkes was savagely tense — 
a big man physically confident 
of himself, mentally prepared for 



murder, but still oddly unsure 
and — expectant! 

T HE EXPLANATION struck 
Commager suddenly: they 

were wondering whether he 
wasn’t going to produce some 
witchcraft trick of his own in this 
emergency! It was such an odd 
shifting of their original roles that 
it startled a snort of rather 
hysterical mirth from him; and 
Hawkes, in the process of hand- 
ing the gun to Barthold, tried to 
jerk it back, and then Commager 
moved. 

He didn’t move toward Hawkes 
but toward Barthold, who seemed 
to have a better hold on the gun. 
They might have thought he was 
after it, too, because Hawkes let 
go and swung too hastily at him, 
as Barthold took a step back. 
Commager slammed a fist into 
Barthold’s body, swung him 
around between Hawkes and him- 
self, and struck hard again. The 
gun didn’t even go off. 

He had no more time then for 
Barthold, because Hawkes ram- 
med into him with disconcerting 
solidness and speed. In an instant, 
it was like fighting a baboon, all 
nails and muscles and smashing 
fists and feet. The top of Hawkes’s 
skull butted his mouth like a 
rock. Commager hit him in the 
back of the neck, was free for a 
moment and hit again. Hawkes 
stepped back, straightening slight- 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



117 



ly, and Commager followed and 
struck once more, in the side. 
Then Hawkes disappeared. 

It was as sudden as that! Reali- 
zation that he was stumbling on 
the edge of the rock shelf him- 
self came together with a glimpse 
of the thundering white commo- 
tion of surf almost vertically be- 
neath him — a good hundred 
and fifty feet down. 

With a terrible trembling still 
in his muscles, he scrambled six 
feet back on the shelf and glared 
wildly around for Lex Barthold. 
But his mind refused to turn 
away from the thought of how 
shockingly close he had come to 
going over with Hawkes; so a 
number of seconds passed before 
he grasped the fact that Barthold 
also was nowhere in sight. 

C OMMAGER’S breathing had 
slowed gradually, while he 
stared warily up the trail to the 
left. The noise of the water 
would have covered any sounds 
of either stealthy withdrawal or 
approach; but since Barthold 
seemed to have preferred to take 
himself and the gun out of the 
fight, it was unlikely he would 
be back. 

On the other hand, there were 
a number of points on that path 
where he could wait for Com- 
mager to come within easy range, 
while he remained out of imme- 
diate physical reach himself. 

118 



To the right, the trail led down. 
Commager glanced in that direc- 
tion again and, this time, saw the 
gun where it had dropped into 
the loose shale of the shelf. 

Lex Barthold was lying on his 
back among the boulders of the 
next shelf down, his legs higher 
than his head, the upper part of 
his body twisted slightly to one 
side. He had fallen only nine feet 
or so, but he wasn’t moving. They 
looked at each other for a mo- 
ment; then Commager safetied 
the gun and put it in his pocket. 
He went on down. 

“Hawkes went over the edge,” 
he said, still rather dazed. “What 
happened to you?” 

Barthold grunted. “Broke my 
back!” He cursed Commager 
briefly. “But you’re a dead man, 
too, Commager!” 

“Neither of us is dead yet,” 
Commager told him. He felt 
physically heavy, cold and tired. 
He hesitated and added, “I’m go- 
ing to go and get help for you.” 
Barthold shook his head slow- 
ly. “You won’t get back up there 
alive. We’ve made sure of you 
this time. .” He sounded matter- 
of-factly certain of it, and if he 
felt any concern about what 
would happen now to himself, 
there was no trace of it in his 
voice. 

Commager stared down at him 
for a moment wondering, and 
then looked around. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



S URF CRASHED rhythmical- 
ly below them; the Moon 
seemed to be sliding fast through 
clouds far out over the Bay. Over- 
head, the broken, sloping cliffs 
might conceal anything or any- 
body. The feeling came strongly 
to him then that in this savage 
and lonely place anything could 
happen without affecting the hu- 
man world at all or being noticed 
by it. 

The night-lit earth seemed to 
shift slowly and giddily about 
him and then steadied again, as 
if he had, just then, drifted far 
beyond the boundaries of the 
reality he knew and were now 
somewhere else, in an area that 
followed laws of its own, if it 
followed any laws at all. 

When he looked at Barthold 
again, he no longer felt the para- 
doxical human desire to find help 
for a man who had tried to kill 
him and whom he had nearly 
killed. He could talk in Bart- 
hold’s own terms. 

He bent over him. “What 
makes you so sure your friends 
have got me?” 

Barthold gave him a mocking 
glance, but he didn’t answer. 

They weren’t certain, Com- 
mager thought, straightening up. 
They were just hoping again! 
That something was preparing 
against hirp was an impression 
he’d gained himself, almost like 
the physical sensation of a hos- 



tile stirring and shifting in the 
air and the rocks about him, a 
secretive gathering of power. But 
they weren’t certain! 

“I think,” he said slowly, “that 
I’ll walk away from here wheh 
I feel like it.” He paused, and 
added deliberately, “You people 
might last longer if you didn’t 
try to play rough, Barthold! Ex- 
cept, of course, with someone like 
Wilson Knox.” 

TJARTHOLD spoke with diffi- 
culty. “The reason you’re 
still alive is that Paylar and I* 
were the only ones who would 
believe you were a natural of the 
new mind. The first one here in 
twenty-three years — ” His breath 
seemed to catch; his face twisted 
into a grimace of pain. “But to- 
night they all know that ordinary 
controls won’t work on you, Com- 
mager! That’s what makes it too 
late for you,” 

Commager hesitated. He said 
gently, “When did you and Pay- 
lar discover I was a natural of 
the new mind?” 

“Sunday night, of course!” 
Barthold was plainly anxious now 
to keep him here. He hurried on, 
“The mistake was made five years 
ago. You should have been de- 
stroyed then, before you had 
learned anything, not placed un- 
der control!” 

Commager’s eyes widened 
slightly. Until that statement, he 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



119 



had given only a fraction of con- 
scious attention to what Barthold 
was saying, the greater part of 
his mind alert to catch those 
wispy, not-quite-physical indica- 
tions that something unhealthy 
was brewing nearby in the night. 
But five years ago! 

“Paylar made me an offer to 
join your group,” he pointed out. 
“Wouldn’t that have been satis- 
factory?” 

Barthold stared up at him. His 
mouth worked, but for a few sec- 
onds he made no audible reply. 

“Don’t wait!” he said with 
startling, savage intensity. “Now, 
or . .” The words thickened and 
slurred into angry, incomprehen- 
sible mutterings. The eyelids 
closed. 

Commager bent down and 
prodded Barthold’s shoulder with 
a forefinger. The man might be 
dying — those last words hadn’t 
sounded as if they were addressed 
to him — but there were things 
he had to know now. “What are 
you, Barthold? Aren’t you a 
natural, too?” 

Barthold’s eyes opened and 
rolled toward him, but remained 
unpleasantly unfocused. “Old 
mind — ” the thick voice mum- 
bled. And then clearly, “You’re 
a fool, Commager! You didn’t 
really know anything! If the 
others — ” 

The eyes closed again. 

Old mind. That still told 



him nothing. “Are the others of 
the old mind?” 

Barthold grinned tiredly. “Why 
don’t you ask Hawkes?” 

There was a sound behind 
Commager like the sloshing of 
water in the bottom of a boat. 
Then he had spun around and 
was on his feet, his hair bristling. 

TT AWKES stood swaying in 
the moonlight, twenty feet 
away. Water ran from his clothes 
to the rocks among which he 
stood. Water had smeared his 
hair down over his face. And the 
left side of his head looked hor- 
ribly flattened. 

He took a step forward, and 
then came on in a swaying rush. 

For a long instant of time, 
Commager only stared. Hawkes 
was dead; quite obviously, even 
now as he moved, he was dead 
— so he hadn’t come climbing 
back up the rocks out of the 
sweeping tug of the waves! He — 

He was gone. 

Commager walked over to the 
point where he had seen Hawkes. 
The rocks were dry. He went 
back to Barthold, his lips still 
stiff with horror. 

“Tell me what this was!” he 
said hoarsely. “Or I’ll kill you 
now!” 

Barthold was still grinning, his 
eyes open and wickedly alert. “A 
picture I let you look at — but, 
you see, you learn too fast! You’re 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE TIES OF EARTH 



121 



a natural. You wouldn’t believe 
a picture now, and the old mind 
couldn’t do anything else to you. 
But there are others working for 
us — and now — ” 

There was a rumbling and a 
grinding and a rushing sound 
overhead. Commager leaped back, 
his eyes darting up. He heard 
Lex Barthold screaming. 

The whole upper cliff-side was 
moving, sliding downward. A 
gray-black, turning, almost verti- 
cal wave of broken rock dropping 
toward them.

?? "OEOPLE like us,” Jean Bo- 
hart remarked, with an air 
of moody discovery, “are really 
pretty lucky!” 

Commager went “Hm?” drows- 
ily. Then he lifted his head to 
look at her. She stood beside the 
Sweet Susan’s lashed wheel, 
shaded blue eyes gazing at him 
from under the brim of her yacht- 
ing cap, hands clasped behind 
her. “What brought that to 
mind?” he inquired. 

“I was thinking about my 
troubles,” she said. “Then I start- 
ed thinking they weren’t really 
so bad! Comparatively — ” 

She was keeping her voice light. 
Commager sat up from where 
he’d stretched himself out beside 
the cabin, gathering his thoughts 
back out of the aimless diffusion 

122 



of sleep. “Ready to talk about 
your troubles now?” 

Jean shook her head. “Not yet.” 
She frowned. “There’s something 
about them I want to figure out 
by myself first — and I’m not 
quite done.” The frown vanished. 
“If you’ve finished your nap, you 
might look around and see what 
a grand morning it is! That’s 
what I meant by being lucky.” 
They were off Dana Point, he 
saw, so he’d slept a full hour 
since Jean had taken them out 
of the Newport Beach harbor. 
The Sweet Susan was running 
smoothly southward, through the 
Pacific’s long smooth swells. Now 
that he was sitting up, the wind 
streamed cool about his head and 
neck and shoulders. 

He said, “Yes, I guess we’re 
lucky.” 

Jean grinned. “And since I’ve 
got you awake, I’ll catch a nap 
myself! Not that I spent the night 
boozing and brawling.” 

Commager smiled at her. “Any 
time you feel like putting in a 
night like that, give me a ring.” 
Superficially, in her white 
slacks and thin sweater, Jean Bo- 
hart looked fresh as a daisy; only 
the tautness about her mouth and 
a controlled rigidity in the way 
she stood suggested that the 
“trouble” might be close to a com- 
plete emotional disaster. 

He’d thought earlier that he 
would have liked to get out of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this jaunt if he could; now he felt 
guilty and a little alarmed. 

TTE MOVED over near the 
wheel while she lay down 
on the bench, pulling a pillow 
under her head and settling back 
with the cap-brim down over her 
eyes. He could tell that the 
muscles of the slim straight body 
weren’t actually going to relax. 
But she would pretend now to be 
asleep and Commager let his 
thoughts shift away from Jean, 
promising himself to give her his 
full attention as soon as she was 
ready to talk. 

There were a few problems of 
his own to be considered, though 
at the moment he had the sense 
of a truce, a lull. Last night, he 
had shaken the Guides badly; he 
had killed two of their members. 
But there were at least three left, 
and he hadn’t crippled their 
power to act. 

The truce, if it was that, was 
due in part to their fear of his 
reaction and in part to an en- 
tirely different kind of restraint 
— a restraint which he believed 
was self-imposed. 

The reason he believed it was 
that he was now aware of being 
under a similar restraint himself. 
He thought he knew why it was 
an inescapable limitation, but im- 
personally he could agree with 
Paylar’s opinion that, from the 
Guides’ point of view, he should 



have been destroyed as soon as 
they became aware of him. 

Left to himself — if in curi- 
osity he had begun to investigate 
psi — he would have discovered 
the limitation quickly enough 
and abided by it. Even so, it ap- 
peared to permit an enormously 
extended range of effective activ- 
ity. And Barthold had implied a 
conflict between an “old mind” 
and a “new mind.” 

It sounded like an esoteric 
classification of varying degrees 
of human psi potential — an 
ascendant individual “new mind” 
threatening the entrenched and 
experienced but more limited 
older group, which compensated 
for its limitation by bringing func- 
tioning members of the “new 
mind” under its control or re- 
pressing or diverting their devel- 
oping abilities. 

He, apparently, was a “natural 
of the new mind.” He couldn’t be 
permanently controlled. To the 
older group he represented an 
intolerable threat. 

S OME ONE, last night, had 
thrown a few thousand tons 
of stone at him! And he had de- 
flected that missile from its 
course. Not by very much, but 
just enough to keep it clear of the 
frantically scrambling figure of 
himself, scuttling up the cliff path 
like a scared beetle. 

He had done it — how? 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



123 



Trying to restructure the ac- 
tion, Commager knew that the 
process itself hadn’t been a con- 
scious one. But it had been sym- 
bolized in his awareness by a 
cluster of pictures that took in 
the whole event simultaneously. 

A visualization of himself and 
the long thundering of the rocks, 
the sideward distortion of their 
line of fall, and a final picture 
again of himself as he reached 
the top of the cliff unharmed. 

It had all been there, in a mo- 
mentary, timeless swirling of pos- 
sibilities against the background 
of rock and shadow, the tilted, 
turning sky and moonlight glit- 
tering on racing waters. 

Then, in an instant, the pattern 
had been set, decided on; and 
the event solidified into reality 
with the final thudding crash. 
Barthold lay buried under the 
rocks and perhaps, down in the 
water, the body of Hawkes also 
had been caught and covered. 

He hadn’t tried to save Bart- 
hold. Instead, automatically, he 
had flung out another kind of 
awareness, a flashing search for 
the mind that had struck at him. 
And he had been prepared, in a 
way he couldn’t have described 
now, to strike back. 

He “found” three of them; the 
one who had acted and two who 
merely observed. Almost, not 
quite, he knew where they were. 
But they were alert. It was as if 

124 



something, barely glimpsed, had 
been flicked out of his sight, leav- 
ing a lifeless black emptiness for 
him to grope through if he chose. 

Commager didn’t choose to do 
any blind groping. He wasn’t sure 
enough of himself for that. 

THHE LIMITATION that he 
— and, apparently, they — 
didn’t dare to violate had to do 
with the preservation of appear- 
ances. It was a line of thought he 
didn’t want to follow too far just 
now. But it -seemed that the 
reality he knew and lived in was 
a framework of appearances, 
tough and durable normally but 
capable of being distorted into 
possibly chaotic variations. 

The penalty seemed to be that 
to the degree one distorted the 
framework, he remained distorted 
himself. The smooth flow of ap- 
pearances was quickly re-estab- 
lished, but the miracle-worker 
found himself left somehow out- 
side. Commager suspected that 
he stayed outside. 

He suspected also that a really 
significant distortion of appear- 
ances would thrust the life and 
mind that caused it so far out 
that, for all practical purposes, 
it ceased to exist. 

He wasn’t tempted to test the 
theory. Its apparent proof was 
that reality, by and large, did 
remain intact, while those who 
played around too consistently 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with even minor infringements 
notoriously failed to thrive. 

To let a pair of dice briefly 
defy the laws of chance probably 
did no harm to anyone, but when 
you aimed and launched the side 
of a cliff as a missile of murder, 
you were very careful that the 
result was a rock-slide and not a 
miracle! 

You didn’t — ever — disturb 
the world of reality. 

W HAT HE had to fear from 
them, if they broke the 
truce, was the ambush, the thing 
done secretly under the appear- 
ance of a natural series of events. 
It left an unpleasantly large num- 
ber of possibilities open, but until 
something new happened, he 
couldn’t know that they weren’t 
ready to call it a draw. So far, 
his spontaneous reactions had 
been entirely effective; the obvi- 
ous damage was all on the other 
side. 

But since the damage wasn’t 
all obvious, he had no present 
intention of forcing a showdown. 
“Natural” or not, he might be 
either not quite good enough at 
that kind of game, or much too 
good. 

But meanwhile — Commager 
looked thoughtfully at Jean Bo- 
hart. She had fallen asleep finally, 
but she wasn’t sleeping comfort- 
ably. Her mouth moved fretfully, 
and she made small whimpering 

THE TIES OF EARTH 



sounds from time to time, almost 
like a puppy that is dreaming 
badly. If he’d become a miracle- 
worker on a small scale, Com- 
mager thought, if he’d already 
pushed himself to some degree 
beyond the normal limits of 
reality, he might as well get some 
use out of what he couldn’t undo. 

Looking at her, it wasn’t too 
difficult to imagine the rigidities 
and tensions that kept Jean from 
finding any real physical rest. 
Nor — a step farther — was it 
hard to get a picture of her emo- 
tional disturbances shaping them- 
selves into a scurrying and shift- 
ing dream-torment. 

Carefully, Commager took hold 
of the two concepts. He waited 
until he could no longer be quite 
sure whether it was he or Jean 
who was really experiencing these 
things; and then, as he had done 
yesterday with the pain in his 
own body, he let dreams and 
tensions ebb away and cease to 
be. 

In spite of everything else that 
had happened, he was still 
amazed, a few moments later, to 
realize that his experiment in 
therapy had been a complete 
success.

C LEAR BLUE bowl of the sky 
above. Black-blue thoppy 
water of the Pacific all about.

The Sweet Susan drifted, throt- 
tled down and almost stationary. 
Near the kelp beds two miles to 
the south, eight other boats grad- 
ually changed their relative posi- 
tions. In the north-east, toward 
which the Sweet Susan slowly 
moved, the dark jaws of the Bay 
opened out, still too far off to 
make out the scars of last night’s 
rock-slide. 

Jean had slept steadily for over 
an hour, and Commager had two 
lines trailing under superficial ob- 
servation. Not even a mackerel 
had taken any interest so far, 
which probably wasn’t due to the 
sinister influence of the Guides, 
but to the fact that the deep drop 
outside the Bay simply wasn’t 
a very good fishing area. 

Unconcerned about that, he’d 
been sitting there for some while, 
in a drowsy, sun-bright day- 
dream composed of an awareness 
of physical well-being, his odd 
certainty that the truce still held, 
and enjoyment of the coincidence 
that the Sun was getting hotter to 
the exact degree that the breeze 
got brisker in compensation. For 
the hour, under such circum- 
stances, the life of an unambi- 
tious, healthy animal seemed to 
be about as much as anybody 
reasonably could ask for. 

He came out of it with a sort 
of frightened start. He had heard 
Jean stirring on the bench behind 
him. Now she yawned, just audi- 

126 



bly, and sat up, and he knew she 
was looking at him. 

Commager couldn’t have said 
what kept him from turning his 
head. There was a momentary 
questioning alarm in him, which 
stiffened into cold watchfulness 
as Jean got up and went into the 
cabin. There had been another 
little shift in the values of reality 
while he was off-guard, he 
thought. Something was a shade 
wrong again, a shade otherwise 
than it had been an hour or so 
ago. But he didn’t yet know what 
it was. 

TNA MINUTE or so Jean came 

out again, and he guessed she’d 
changed into her swimsuit. He 
heard her come up behind him, 
and then a pair of smooth arms 
were laid lightly across his 
shoulders and a voice, from a 
point a little above and behind 
his head, inquired, “Had any luck, 
Alan? The Sun got a bit too hot 
for me.” 

It shocked him completely be- 
cause it was Lona who touched 
him and spoke. 

It was also, of course, Jean 
Bohart — and there was no long- 
er any question that she’d served 
as the model for his imaginary 
woman. It had been out of just 
such scraps of illusion as this — 
voice sounds and touches, dis- 
torted seconds in time — that 
he’d built up that self-deception. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



How he had been reached in 
the first place to get him started 
on the construction was some- 
thing he couldn’t yet recall, but 
the purpose was also completely 
obvious. 

Five years ago, Lex Barthold 
had said, they’d taken him under 
control. 

To divert a mind from a direc- 
tion you didn’t want it to follow, 
you gave it a delusion to stare 
at. 

You drenched the delusion in 
violently unpleasant emotions, 
which kept the mind from any 
closer investigation of the dis- 
turbance — 

Apparently, they’d expected 
the treatment to be effective for 
the rest of his lifetime. But when 
Ira reported on the minor sensa- 
tion Commager had created in a 
Las Vegas club, they’d come alert 
to the fact that his developing 
psi abilities hadn’t been perman- 
ently stunted. And then a major- 
ity of them had been afraid to 
attempt to kill a “natural.” 

Unconsciously, he’d resisted 
the next maneuver — drastic as 
it had been — to throw him into 
a delusive tizzy. 

Then he’d begun to strike back 
at them. 

It wasn’t really surprising, he 
thought, that they’d become a 
little desperate. And they might 
have known of that dice game 
before Ira told them about it. Ira 



had been their means of contact- 
ing him directly. 

As Jean had been the means 
of keeping the primary delusion 
reinforced and alive. 

<r<?TVTO LUCK, so far!” he told 
’ her, somewhat carefully. 
The momentary shock of recog- 
nition had faded, but some of the 
feeling he’d wasted on the delu- 
sion seemed to have transferred 
itself back to the model now! It 
didn’t really surprise him, and it 
wasn’t an unpleasant sensation; 
but, for a moment, at least, he 
didn’t want it to show in his voice. 
“Did you get caught up on your 
sleep?” 

It might have showed in his 
voice, because she moved away 
from him and leaned over the 
side of the boat, looking at the 
lines. “Uh-huh!” she said casu- 
ally. “I feel fine now! Better than 
I have in a long time, as a matter 
of fact.” 

Commager regarded her specu- 
latively. The easy grace of her 
body confirmed what she said; 
the tensions were gone. He patted 
himself mentally on the back. 
Commager the Healer! 

“Alan?” 

“Yes?” he said. 

“I’m leaving Ira.” Her face 
flushed a little. “To be more exact 
about it, Ira’s leaving me! For 
that MacDonald woman you met 
Sunday!” 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



127 



Commager said softly that he’d 
be damned. His thoughts were 
racing as she went on, “He told 
me yesterday morning. It jolted 
my vanity, all right! But the 
funny thing is, you know, that 
as soon as I got over that, I found 
I actually didn't care. It was 
really a relief. Isn’t that funny?” 

He didn’t think it was funny. 
It was a little too pat. 

66T^OR FIVE years,” she said, 
turning to face him, “I 
thought I loved that guy. And 
now I find I never did!” She 
shook her head. “I don’t get it, 
Alan. How can anyone be so 
crazy?” 

“What are you going to do?” 
he asked. 

She stared at him for a mo- 
ment, looking appealing, hurt and 
lovely. If he put his hand out to 
her now, she’d be in his arms. 

“I’m going to Florida for a few 
months. Ira can settle it any way 
he wants to.” 

So that was the way it had 
been, Commager thought in 
astounded fury. He was the one 
they’d wanted to hold down, but 
it wasn’t only his life they’d twist- 
ed and distorted to do it. They’d 
used Jean just as ruthlessly. And, 
perhaps, Ira — 

For five years, he could have 
had his imaginary woman. She’d 
been within his reach in reality. 

And, now that delusions were 



not working so well any more, 
they threw the reality at him! 

Only now it was a little too 
late. He’d changed too far to be 
able to accept their gift. 

“Jean,” he said. 

“Yes, Alan?” 

“You’re going to stop thinking 
for a while now,” he told her 
gently. “Y ou’re going to just stand 
there for a while and not be 
aware of anything that happens.” 

A puzzled frown formed on 
her face as he started to speak, 
but it smoothed out again, and 
then she went on looking placidly 
at him. Perhaps her eyes had 
dulled a trifle. 

HT HIS TIME, it didn’t surprise 
Commager at all. Out be- 
yond the Sweet Susan, he saw 
something like a faint haze be- 
ginning to shape itself over the 
moving surface of the water. He 
grinned a little. 

Slowly and deliberately, he 
framed the cold thought in his 
mind: Do what you can for your- 
selves! The truce is over! 

Their response was an instan- 
taneous one. A long swell rose 
up behind the Sweet Susan, lifted 
the boat, passing beneath it, and 
dropped it again. The Sweet 
Susan was still rising as Com- 
mager picked up Jean Bohart 
and set her down beside the 
bench near the wheel; and it 
slapped down in a smash of spray 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as he cut the lashings of the 
wheel with the emergency knife 
and pulled out the throttle. 

He glanced around. The haze 
was a thick fog about them, bril- 
liant white against the blue of 
the sky overhead, while they ran 
through its wet, gray shade. The 
boat shuddered sideways behind 
the big swell, water roiling about 
it. Suddenly, with a kind of hor- 
ror, Commager understood what 
was there. 

He had seen pictures of it, or 
rather of a part of it, cast up on 
the coast years before: a house- 
sized chunk of rotten, oddly 
coarse-grained flesh, hurriedly 
disposed of and never identified. 
The drifted remnant of a name- 
less phenomenon of the Pacific 
deeps. 

The phenomenon itself was 
underneath them now! 

S TILL TOO far down to have 
done more than briefly con- 
vulse the surface as it turned, it 
was rising toward the boat. A 
thing of icy, incredible pressures, 
it was disrupted and dying as it 
rose, incapable of understanding 
the impulse that had forced it 
from the dark ocean up toward 
the coast hours before. But it 
was certain that, in the bright 
glare above it, it would find and 
destroy the cause of its pain. 

So it came up with blind, hide- 
ous swiftness; and Commager dis- 



covered that rushing bulk could 
not be simply turned away from 
them as he had turned the rocks. 
It was driven by its own sick and 
terrible purpose. Neither could 
he reach the minds that guided 
it. This time, they were alertly 
on guard. 

With seconds to spare then, 
he turned the boat. 

In the fog to their left, the 
sea opened in a thundering series 
of crashes and settled again. 
Water smashed into the boat as 
it danced and drove raggedly 
away, and before it had gone very 
far it was lifted once more on a 
thrust of water from below. 

The thing from the sea had 
followed, and it was terribly close! 
So close that the flickering dull 
glow of a mind as primitive as 
the monstrous body itself rose up 
in Commager’s awareness. 

He caught at it. 

What he drove into the glow 
was like an insistence on its de- 
struction. It seemed to blaze up 
in brief, white fury and then 
went black. 

The Sweet Susan drove on 
through a curiously disturbed sea, 
surrounded by dissipating wisps 
of what might or might not have 
been an ordinary patch of fog. 
Probably, no one on any of the 
distant fishing boats even noticed 
that minor phenomenen. 

A half-mile away, the water 
roiled once more; and that was 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



129 



all. The Pacific had gone back 
to its normal behavior. 

XII 

TT WAS sunset on the Bay, and 

Paylar was talking, at least 
most of the time. Sometimes 
Commager listened and some- 
times he didn’t. 

It was a fairy tale situation, he 
thought, somewhat amused at 
himself. Because he could feel 
the mood of it very strongly, a 
childlike one, a mood of enchant- 
ment around him and of terror 
along the fringes of the enchant- 
ment. Terror that was in part 
past, and in part still to come. 

Far below the slope where 
they sat, sun-fires gleamed in the 
dark, moving waters, like fire 
shining out of the heart of a black 
jewel. Down there, as was not 
inappropriate near the end of 
a fairy tale, two of the bad ones 
lay dead and buried, unless one 
of them had been taken away by 
the water. 

Much farther out, miles out, 
the body of a defeated dragon 
bumped slowly along the sea- 
bottom, back to the deeps, nib- 
bled at, tugged at, pulled and 
turned by armies of hungry fish. 

A blonde and beautiful prin- 
cess was halfway to the far land 
of flowers called Florida by now, 
flying through the night skies, 
and released at last from an evil 

130 



enchantment. She might still 
wonder at how oddly she’d acted 
the past few years, but she’d be- 
gun to look forward to new and 
exciting activities — and she was 
rapidly forgetting Alan Com- 
mager in the process. 

It had been the only way to 
arrange it, because this was a 
trap of magic Jean had no busi- 
ness being in, and she’d been in 
it only because of him. He’d got 
himself the other one, the dark, 
beautiful, wicked witch, to keep 
company instead. 

So Paylar talked of magical 
things, and he listened, pleasantly 
fascinated and willing for an hour 
to believe anything she told him. 
Earth turned under them, vast 
and ponderous, away from the 
Sun and into the night, a big, 
convincing stage background to 
what she was talking about. 

A LL EARTH life, she said, was 
a single entity, growing and 
developing from this great globe, 
and its conscious thinking pro- 
cesses went on mainly in that 
part of it that was human. Which 
was fine, she explained, while all 
humans were still Old Mind, as 
they had been at first, because 
they were aware of Earth and 
cared for it, knowing they were 
a part of it, and that it all be- 
longed together. But then New 
Mind humans came along, as a 
natural development. They could 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



think a little better than the 
others, but they were no longer 
aware of being a part of Earth 
life and didn’t care about any- 
thing much but themselves, since 
they considered themselves to be 
individuals. 

It didn’t matter too much. 
They were still influenced by the 
purpose and patterns of Earth 
life, and had practically no con- 
scious defenses against what 

seemed to them to be obscure 

motivations of their own. And 
there were always enough Old 
Mind people around who knew 
what was going on to direct the 
rather directionless New Minders 
patiently back to the old patterns, 
so that in the long run things 

tended to keep moving along 

much as they always had done. 

It began to matter when New 
Minders developed a conscious 
interest in what was now called 
psi. That was an Earth life ability 
which had its purpose in keeping 
the patterns intact; and only the 
New Mind, which had intelli- 
gence without responsibility, was 
capable of using psi individualis- 
tically and destructively. 

In most periods of time, the 
New Mind was kept from investi- 
gating psi seriously by its super- 
stitious dread of phenomena it 
couldn’t rationalize. But when it 
did get interested — 

In the Old Mind, adherence 
to the Earth life pattern was so 



complete that dangerous psi abili- 
ties simply didn’t develop. 

“So you see,” she said, “we need 
New Mind psi to control New 
Mind psi.” 

C OMMAGER said he’d come 
to understand that finally. 
And also that they were able to 
keep control of the people they 
used by the fact that psi abilities 
tended to be as deadly to their 
possessor as to anyone else, when 
employed without careful re- 
straint. “At best, I imagine there’s 
a high turnover rate in the New 
Mind section of an organization 
like the Guides.” 

“There is,” she agreed coolly. 
“Particularly since we select the 
ones that are potentially the most 
dangerous as recruits. The ones 
most hungry for power. Ruth, for 
example, is not likely to live out 
another year.” 

Privately and thoughtfully, 
Commager confirmed that opin- 
ion. “Doesn’t that unusual mor- 
tality attract attention?” he in- 
quired. It seemed a little tactless, 
but he added, “What about 
Hawkes and Barthold, for exam- 
ple? Aren’t they going to be offi- 
cially missed?” 

“Hawkes was known to be 
nearly psychopathic,” Paylar re- 
plied. “Whatever happened to 
him will surprise no one officially. 
And no one but ourselves knew 
anything about Lex.” 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



131 



She had showed, Commager 
thought, an appalling indifference 
to the fate of her late companions. 
He studied her for a moment 
with interested distaste. “You 
know,” he remarked then, “I don’t 
feel any very strong urges for 
power myself. How does that fit 
in with your story?” 

She shrugged. “A natural is 
always unpredictable. You have 
a blend of Old Mind and New 
Mind qualities, Alan, that might 
have made you extremely useful 
to us. But since you didn’t choose 
to be useful, we can’t take a 
chance on you.” 

He let that pass. “Where do 
people like you and Barthold 
come from?” he inquired curi- 
ously. “How did you get involved 
in this kind of thing?” 

CHE HERSELF came, she 
^ said, from a mountain village 
in northern Italy. Its name was 
as unimportant as her own. As 
for the role she was playing, in 
part she’d been instructed in it, 
and in part she’d known instinc- 
tively what she had to do. She 
smiled at him. “But none of that 
is going to concern you very 
much longer, Alan!” 

She sounded unpleasantly cer- 
tain about it. Although he thought 
he could foretell quite precisely 
what was going to happen to- 
night, Commager felt a little 
shaken. He suggested, “What 

132 



would happen if people like my- 
self were just left to do as they 
pleased?” 

“Earth would go insane,” she 
said calmly. The extravagance of 
the statement jolted him again, 
but he could see the analogue. 
The Old Mind was full of fears, 
too — the fear of chaos. 

“That offer you made me to 
become one of the Guides — was 
that a trap, or was it meant sin- 
cerely?” 

Her face abruptly became cau- 
tious and alert. “It was meant 
sincerely.” 

“How could you have trusted 
me?” 

She said evasively, “There was 
a great deal you could have 
learned from us. You have dis- 
covered some of the things you 
can do by yourself, but you real- 
ize the dangers of uninstructed 
experimentation.” 

He looked at her, remembering 
the limitations of Old Mind and 
that, because of them, there 
couldn’t be any real compromise. 
He didn’t doubt they would have 
showed him what was safe to do 
and of use to them; but the only 
circumstances under which they 
really could trust him would be 
to have him so befuddled that 
he’d be almost completely de- 
pendent on their assistance and 
advice. So they would also have 
showed him things that were very 
much less than safe — for him.

He thought that Herbert 
Hawkes had followed that road 
almost to the end before he died, 
and that Ruth MacDonald was 
rather far advanced on it by now. 
Those two had been merely 
greedy and power-hungry people, 
utilizing talents which were more 
expensive than they’d been al- 
lowed to guess. Lex and Paylar 
had been the only leaders among 
the ones he’d met of that group. 

He didn’t bother to repeat his 
question; but Paylar said sudden- 
ly, “Why did you bring me out 
here this evening, Alan?” 

<*<*T THOUGHT I might find 
what was left of the Guides 
at Hawkes’ place,” Commager 
said. “I was a little annoyed, 
frankly, both because of some- 
thing that happened today, and 
because of something that was 
done a while ago to somebody 
else. I was going to tell you to 
stop playing games around me 
and people I happen to like — 
or else!” 

He grinned at her. “Of course, 
I realized you weren’t going to 
risk a showdown right in the 
middle of town! It could get a 
little too spectacular. But since 
you were conveniently waiting 
alone there for me, I brought you 
out here.” 

“Supposing,” Paylar said, “that 
we don’t choose to accept a show- 
down here either?” 



“Lady,” he told her, “if it looks 
as if nothing is going to be settled, 
there are experiments I can start 
on with you that should have you 
yelling very quickly for help to 
any Guides remaining in the area. 
As I figure it, you see, a New 
Mind natural might be able to 
control an Old Mind expert very 
much as you intended to control 
me.” 

She went a little white. “That 
could be true. But you can’t hope 
to survive a showdown, Alan!” 

He spread his hands. “Why 
not? Logically, at least, I don’t 
think there are very many of you 
left.” He was almost certain he 
knew of one who hadn’t openly 
played a part as yet, but he didn’t 
intend to mention that name at 
the moment. “It wouldn’t take 
more than a handful of developed 
New Mind psis to control an area 
like this. And you wouldn’t want 
more than a handful around or 
you couldn’t be sure of control- 
ling them!” 

She nodded. “That’s also true, 
of course. But you’re still at a 
hopeless disadvantage, Alan. We 
— the Old Mind knows exactly 
how this situation can be resolved 
in our favor, if we’re prepared to 
lose a few more of our controlled 
psis. 

“The psis mightn’t feel quite 
so calm about it,” Commager 
pointed out. He hesitated. 
“Though I suppose you might 



THE TIES OF EARTH

have them believing by now that 
I’m out to eat them!” 

“They’ve been led to consider 
you a deadly threat to their exist- 
ence,” Paylar agreed with a touch 
of complacency. “They’ll take 
any risk that’s required, particu- 
lar since they won’t understand 
the full extent of the risk. 
And that isn’t all, Alar.. You’re 
not the first New Mind natural 
we’ve dealt with, you know. If 
anything goes seriously wrong 
in this area, Old Mind all over 
the Earth will be aware of it.” 

TTE FROWNED doubtfully at 
her, because he’d been won- 
dering about that. And then he 
let the thought come deliberately 
into the foreground of his con- 
sciousness that he would prefer 
to reach an agreement, if it could 
be done. The Guides’ ability to 
grasp what was going on in his 
mind seemed to be a very hazy 
one; but in a moment, though 
Paylar’s expression didn’t change, 
he was certain she had picked up 
that intentional piece of informa- 
tion. 

She said, with a slow smile, 
“How much do you remember of 
your parents, Alan?” 

He stared at her in surprise. 
“Not very much. They both died 
when I was young. Why?” 

She persisted, “Do you recall 
your mother at all?” 

“No,” he admitted warily. “She 

134 



divorced my father about two 
years after I was born. I stayed 
with him and never saw her 
again. I understand she died 
about three years later.” 

“And your father?” she asked 
him insistently. 

Commager gestured patiently 
toward the Bay. “My father 
drowned out there on a fishing 
trip when I was eleven. I remem- 
ber him well enough, actually. 
Afterward I was raised by a 
guardian. Do you mind telling 
me what these questions are 
about?” 

“Your father,” she said, “was 
of the Old Mind, Alan. So he 
must have known what you might 
develop into almost since your 
birth.” 

A DDLY ENOUGH, he found, 
he was immediately willing 
to accept that as valid informa- 
tion. “Why didn’t he do some- 
thing about his shocking little 
offspring?” he inquired. 

“Apparently,” Paylar said calm- 
ly, “he did. If he hadn’t died, your 
special abilities might have been 
blocked away so completely that 
they would never have come to 
your attention — or brought you 
to our attention. As it was, what 
he did to check you was simply 
not sufficient.” 

Commager considered the pos- 
sibility, and again it seemed that 
that was what had occurred. It

y 



was too long ago to arouse any 
particular emotion' in him. He 
said absently, watching her, 
“What’s all this supposed to 
prove, Paylar?” 

“That we’re not trying to con- 
trol you out of malice. It seems 
as necessary to us now as it did 
to your father then.” 

He shrugged. “That makes no 
difference, you know. If more con- 
trol is all you have to offer, I’m 
afraid we’ll go right on disagree- 
ing.” 

Paylar nodded. Then she just 
sat there, apparently uncon- 
cerned, apparently satisfied with 
what had been said and with 
things as they were, until Com- 
mager added suddenly, “I get the 
notion that you’ve just informed 
your little pals it’s time for direct 
action. Correct?” 

“Two of them are on their way 
here.” She gave him her slight 
smile. “When they arrive, we’ll 
see what occurs, Alan! Would you 
like me to show you some pic- 
tures meanwhile?” 

“Pictures?” He stared at her 
and laughed. He was baffled and, 
for the moment, furious. He could, 
as she must realize and as he had 
once threatened to do, break her 
slim neck in one hand. The indi- 
cations were that he could break 
her mind as easily if he exerted 
himself in that direction. But she 
seemed completely unconcerned 
about either possibility. 



IT ER SMILE widened. “I 
caught that,” she remarked. 
“You were really broadcasting, 
Alan! You won’t try to hurt me. 
— you’re really incapable of it 
- — unless you become very fright- 
ened. And you’re almost sure you 
can handle all three of us any- 
way, so you’re not yet afraid. 

And in that, for once, she 
might have given him more in- 
formation than she knew. Be- 
cause he had sensed there had 
been three of them involved, two 
actively and one as an observer, 
in the last two attempts against 
him. Paylar, he guessed, had been 
the observer — supervisor might 
be the better term. 

If those three were the only 
Guides that remained active 
locally, she was quite right: he 
was convinced he could handle 
them! And if, as seemed likely, 
they were going to leave him no 
choice about it, he would. 

What Old Mind elsewhere 
might think or do would be an- 
other matter then. He wasn’t at 
all sure that he couldn’t handle 
that problem also. Another piece 
of information Paylar had given 
him in the last minute or so was 
that sudden flares of emotion 
made him “legible” to those who 
had her own level of ability. 

He would avoid such emotion- 
al outbursts in future. 

“What kind of pictures did you 
intend to show me?” he inquired. 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



135 




“You think I’m trying to trap 
you,” she accused him. 

“Aren’t you?” Commager asked, 
surprised. 

“Of course! But only by show- 
ing you what Earth-life really is 
like — while there is still time.” 
“Well,” he said agreeably, “go 
ahead. .” 

S O HE SAT there in the dark 
between sunset and moonrise 
and watched pictures, though that 
wasn’t quite what they were. At 
first, it seemed as if time were 
flowing around him; the Moon 
would be overhead briefly and 
gone again, while the planes of 
the ground nearby shifted and 
changed. That, he thought, was 
to get him used to the process, 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




condition him a little. The trick- 
eries would come next! 

But when they came, they 
weren’t really trickery. He was 
simply, Commager decided, being 
shown life as Old Mind knew it 
and as, in a way, it was; though 
he himself had never thought to 
take quite so dramatic and vivid 
a view of it. Laughing and crying, 
thundering and singing, Earth- 
life drifted past in terrors and 
delights, flows of brightness and 
piercing sound and of blackest 
silence and night. 

At last, through all that tumult 



of light and fragrance and emo- 
tion, he began to grow aware of 
what to Old Mind, at least, was 
primarily there: the driving, 

powerful, unconscious but tre- 
mendous purpose. Earth dying 
and living, near-eternal. 

In his mind, he found himself 
agreeing that it was a true pic- 
ture of life and a good one. 

He was a traitor to that life. 
Old Mind whispered to him. 
Earth needed him and had creat- 
ed him to help hold back the 
night and the cold forever! But 
the tiny, individual selfishness 




THE TIES OF EARTH 



137 




of the New Mind broke away 
from the flow of life and denied 
it. 

So, in the end, all would die 
together — 

The flow slowed. Into it crept 
the cold and the dark — a chill 
awareness of the approaching 
frozen and meaningless immo- 
bility of chaos. 

It wasn’t till then that Com- 
mager reached out carefully and 
altered the pictures a trifle. It 
had been a good show, he 
thought, though overly dramatic; 
and Paylar had timed the para- 
lyzing emergence of chaos very 
nicely. The two for whom he’d 
been waiting had just reached 
the turnoff from the highway. 

XIII 

npHE HEADLIGHTS of the 
-*■ car glided swiftly down the 
Bay Road, as he brought his 
awareness back hurriedly to bis 
immediate surroundings to check 
on the physical condition of his 
companion. She sat upright a few 
feet away from him, her legs 
crossed under her, her hands 
dropped laxly into her lap, while 
the black animal eyes stared in 
blind horror at the frozen picture 
oi chaos. 

She would keep, he decided. 
And he wasn’t really worried 
about the other two . Ira Bo- 
hart and Ruth MacDonald. 



He reached out for them, and 
as they flashed savagely back at 
him, he drew away, out of time, 
into the space that was open to 
New Mind only, where they 
would have to follow if they 
wanted to touch him. 

They followed instantly, with 
a furious lust for destruction 
which wasn’t unexpected but 
which shocked him nevertheless. 
They came like daggers of 
thought, completely reckless, and 
if they succeeded in touching him 
in the same way he had touched 
the sea-thing, the struggle would 
be over in an instant. 

It became obvious immediate- 
ly that he could prevent them 
from doing it, which — since he 
was a stronger, more fully devel- 
oped specimen of their own class 
— was only to be expected. What 
concerned him was their utter 
lack of consideration for their 
own survival. The car they were 
in hadn’t stopped moving; in less 
than half a minute now it would 
be approaching the sharp curve 
above the Bay. 

He had counted on the driver’s 
attention being forced away from 
him momentarily, either to stop 
the car or to manipulate it safely 
around the curve; in that instant, 
he would bring the other one 
under his control as completely 
as he had trapped Paylar, and 
he would then be free to deal at 
his leisure with the driver.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



NDIVIDUALLY, any one of 
the Guides was weaker than a 
New Mind natural; it had looked 
as simple as that! He wanted to 
save what was left of the group, 
to operate through them very 
much as Old Mind had been do- 
ing, but with a very different 
purpose. 

The two who attacked should 
be withdrawing by now, dismayed 
at not having found him para- 
lyzed by Paylar’s “pictures,” as 
they must have expected. They 
might be waiting for her to come 
to their assistance in some other 
manner, not knowing that she was 
no longer even aware of the strug- 
gle. However, within seconds the 
need of controlling the car would 
become urgent enough to settle 
the issue — 

In an instant, he felt himself 
drawn down, blinded and smoth- 
ered, in the grasp of a completely 
new antagonist! It was not so 
much the awareness of power im- 
mensely beyond that of the 
Guides that stunned him; it was 
a certainty that this new contact 
was a basically horrible and in- 
tolerable thing. In the fractional 
moment of time that everything 
in him was straining simply to 
escape from it, the New Minders 
drove through their attack. 

Pain was exploding every- 
where through his being, as he 
wrenched himself free. Death had 
moved suddenly very close! Be- 



cause the third opponent wasn’t 
Paylar, never had been Paylar. 
He had miscalculated — and so 
there had been one he’d over- 
looked. 

Now they had met, he knew 
he wasn’t capable of handling 
this third opponent and the two 
New Minders together. 

Then without warning the 
New Minders vanished out of 
his awareness, like twin gleams 
of light switched off. Seconds 
later, from somewhere far out on 
the edge of his consciousness, as 
if someone else were thinking it, 
the explanation came: The car! 
They weren’t able to stop the 
car! 

With that, the last of them 
drove at him again; and for a 
moment he was swept down into 
its surging emotions, into a black 
wave of rage and terror, heavy 
and clinging. But he was not un- 
prepared for it now, and he 
struck at the center of its life 
with deadly purpose, his own 
terrors driving him. Something 
like a long, thin screaming rose 
in his mind. 

In that moment, complete un- 
derstanding came. 

As in a dream scene, he was 
looking down into the yard of 
the Temple of Antique Chris- 
tianity. It was night-time now; 
and on the dais he’d investigated 
the day before, a bulky, shapeless 
figure twisted and shook under 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



139 



a robelike cloth which covered 
it completely. 

The screaming ended abruptly, 
and the shape lay still. 

XIV 

C OMMAGER sat up dizzily. 

He discovered first that he 
was incredibly drenched with 
sweat, and that Paylar still sat in 
an unchanged position, as she 
stared at the thing he’d set before 
her mind to fix her attention. 
Down on the Bay Road, there 
was a faint shouting. 

He stood up shakily and 
walked forward till he could look 
down to the point where the road 
curved sharply to the left to 
parallel the Bay. The shouting 
had come from there. A few peo- 
ple were moving about, two of 
them with flashlights. Intermit- 
tently, in their beams, he could 
see the white, smashed guard rail- 
ings. 

A brief, violent shuddering 
overcame him, and he went back 
to where Paylar sat, trying to 
organize his thoughts. The reason 
for her confident expectance of 
his defeat was obvious now. 

The unsuspected opponent — 
the gross shape that had kicked 
about and died on the dais, the 
woman he’d known as Mrs. Love- 
lock — had been another New 
Mind natural. Or, rather, what 
had become of a New Mind 

140 



natural after what probably had 
been decades of Old Mind con- 
trol! But that part wasn’t the 
worst of it. 

1 met her and talked to her! 
he thought in a flash of grief and 
horror. But I couldn’t guess — 

He drove the thought from his 
mind. If he wanted to go on living 
— and he realized with a flicker 
almost of surprise that he very 
much did — he had other work 
to complete tonight. A kind of 
work that he’d considered in ad- 
vance as carefully as the rest of 
it — 

And this time, he thought grim- 
ly, he’d better not discover later 
that he’d miscalculated any de- 
tails. 

He sat down and rolled over 
on his side in the exact place and 
position in which he’d been lying 
before. Almost the last thing he 
saw was the sudden jerky motion 
of Paylar’s body, as he dissolved 
the visual fixation he’d caught 
her attention in. Then, as she 
turned her head quickly to look 
at him, he closed his eyes. 

YV7HEN Commager’s mind re- 
” sumed conscious control of 
his body, there was a cloudy sky 
overhead and a cool gray wetness 
in the air. Paylar stood nearby, 
looking thoughtfully down at him. 

He looked back at her with- 
out speaking. The terrifying con- 
viction of final failure settled 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



slowly and dismally on him. 

“You can wake up fully now,” 
she told him. “It’s nearly mor- 
ning.” 

He nodded and sat up. 

“What I shall tell you,” her 
voice went on, “are things you 
will comprehend and know to be 
true. But consciously you will 
forget them again as soon as I 
tell you to forget. You under- 
stand?” 

Commager nodded again. 

“Very well,” she said. “Some- 
where inside you something is 
listening to what I am saying; 
and I’m really speaking now to 
that part of you — inside. Here 
and tonight, Alan, you very near- 
ly won, though of course you 
could not have won in the final 
issue. But you must understand 
now, consciously and uncon- 
sciously, that you have been com- 
pletely defeated! Otherwise, you 
would not stop struggling until 
you had destroyed yourself — 
as thoroughly as another one, 
very like yourself, whom you met 
tonight, did years ago!” 

She paused. “You know, of 
course, that the New Mind 
natural you killed tonight was 
your mother. We counted on the 
shock of that discovery to para- 
lyze you emotionally, if all else 
failed. When it happened, for the 
few seconds during which the 
shock was completely effective, 
i uras released bv others of the it 



Old Mind from the trap in which 
you had caught me.” 

She smiled. “That was a clever 
trap, Alan! Though if it hadn’t 
been so clever, we might not have 
needed to sacrifice your mother. 
In those few seconds, you see, I 
planted a single, simple compul- 
sion into your mind — that when 
you pretended afterward to be- 
come unconscious — as it ap- 
peared you were planning to do 
to deceive the Old Mind — your 
consciousness actually would 
blank out.” 

TT E TRIED TO remember. 

Something like that had oc- 
curred! He had intended to act 
as if the struggle with the New 
Minders had exhausted him to 
the point where it was possible 
for Paylar to take him under 
complete control, since only in 
that way could he be safe from 
continuing Old Mind hostility. 
But then — 

He had no awareness of what 
had happened in the hours that 
followed till now! 

“You see?” Paylar nodded. 
There was a trace of compassion, 
almost of regret, in her expres- 
sion. “Believe me, Alan, never in 
our knowledge has a functioning 
human mind been so completely 
trapped as you are now! I have 
been working steadily on you for 
the past six hours, and even now 
would be impossible for you 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



Ml 



to detect the manner in which 
you are limited. But within min- 
utes, you will simply forget the 
fact that any limitations have 
been imposed on you, and so you 
will remain free of the internal 
conflicts that destroyed your 
mother.” 

She paused. “And here is a final 
proof for you, Alan, of why this 
was necessary for us. You re- 
called that your father drowned 
in this Bay when you were a 
child. But as yet you seem to 
have blocked out of your memory 
the exact manner in which he 
died — ” 

Her voice changed, grew cold 
and impersonal. “Let that mem- 
ory come up now, Alan!” 

HE MEMORY came. With 
it came memory of the 
shocking conflict of emotion that 
had caused him to bury the 
events of that day long ago. But 
it aroused no emotional response 
in him now. It had been a mem- 
ber of an alien, hostile species 
he had compelled to thrust itself 
down into the water, until the 
air exploded from its lungs and 
it sank away and drowned . 
of the same hostile species as the 
one talking to him now. 

“Yes,” she said. “You drowned 
him, Alan, when you first became 
aware of the mental controls he 
had imposed on you. And then 
you forced yourself to forget, be- 

142 



cause your human conditioning 
made the memory intolerable. 
But you aren’t truly human, you 
see. You are an evolutionary mis- 
take that might destroy the life 
of all Earth if left unchecked!” 

She concluded, “It has taken 
all these years to trap you again, 
under conditions that would per- 
mit us to impose controls that 
no living mind, even in theory, 
could break. But the efforts and 
the risks have been well worth- 
while to Old Mind! For, you see, 
we can use your abilities now to 
make sure there will be no 
trouble from others of your kind 
for many years to come. And we 
can, as the need arises, direct you 
to condition others of your kind 
exactly as you have been condi- 
tioned . But now” — a flat, 
impersonal command drove at 
him again through her voice — 
“forget what I have told you! 
All of it!” 

And, consciously, the mind of 
Commager forgot. 

TTE HAD DONE, he thought, 
as he watched his body stand 
up and follow the woman up the 
path to his cabin, a superbly 
complete job of it! 

What identity might be re- 
mained an intriguing problem for 
future research, though perhaps 
not one that he himself would 
solve. For practical purposes, at 

any rate, the identity of Alan 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Commager was no longer ab- 
sorbed by the consciousness that 
rose from and operated through 
his brain and body. 

And that was the only kind of 
consciousness Old Mind knew 
about. He was hidden from Pay- 
lar’s species now because he had 
gone, and would remain perman- 
ently, beyond the limits of their 
understanding. 

He directed an order to the 
body’s mind, and the body 
stumbled obediently, not know- 
ing why it had stumbled. Paylar 
turned and caught its arm, al- 
most solicitously, steadying it. 

“You’ll feel all right again after 
a few hours rest, Alan!” she told 
it soothingly. 

Species as alien almost as a 
cat or a slender, pretty monkey, 
but with talents and purposes of 
her own, Paylar was, he thought, 
an excellent specimen of the 
second highest development of 
Earth evolution. 

He reached very carefully now 
through the controls he had im- 
posed on her consciousness to 
the core of her being, and ex- 
plained gently to her what he had 
done. 

For a few seconds, he encoun- 
tered terror and resistance, but 



resignation came then, and fin- 
ally understanding and a kind of 
contentment. 

She would help him faithfully 
against Old Mind now, though 
she would never be aware of do- 
ing it. 

And that, he thought, was 
really all for the moment. The 
next step, the development of 
New Mind psi in others, was an 
unhurried, long-term project. In 
all the area within his range, Old 
Mind control had stifled or dis- 
torted whatever promise origin- 
ally had been present. 

B UT THE abilities were ever- 
recurring. And here and 
there, as he became aware of 
them now, their possessors would 
be contacted, carefully instructed 
and shielded against Old Mind 
spies. Until they had developed 
sufficiently to take care of them- 
selves and of others. Until there 
were enough of them. 

Enough to step into the role 
for which they had been evolved 
— and which the lower mind had 
been utterly unable to, compre- 
hend. To act as the matured new 
consciousness of the giant Earth- 
life organism.

practically over the dead bodies 
of the whole company. 

Next time was as we were cross- 
ing the Pacific. Again the first 
sergeant challenged me and again 
the sensation paralyzed me. I 
said the war in the Pacific would 
end August 13th, but this time 
I was smarter — I wanted two-to- 
one odds and a month either way. 
The actual date was the 14th and 
he was glad to pay off. 

But then the men wanted to 
know when they were getting 
home. I truthfully told them I 
didn’t know when they were 
leaving, but I was going back in 
February. Until just recently, I 
thought I’d missed once more 
and sailed in March — until I 
came across the ship’s paper. It 
was dated February 16th. What 
I didn’t foresee was that I’d be 
coming home on an emergency 
furlough to find my father dying. 

Those and others were my suc- 
cesses, if you want to call it that, 
in precognition. Now before some 
financial paper puts in a bid, let 
me enter on the record that I had 
exactly the same feeling on dif- 
ferent occasions and was as wrong 
as any market analyst. 

What do you do with a thing 
like that? Apparently it takes 
great tension to get the data, like 
working up a wicked electrical 
potential to spark a gap — in 
these cases, a gap of four to six 

144 



months. Do we test only when 
the potential exists? Or will we 
find a way of creating it by some 
kind of emotional dynamo? If 
that’s it, I won’t be a volunteer 
and I pity those who are — it 
hurts even when the answer is 
wrong. 

I’ve had the usual “triumphs” 
in telepathy that I imagine all 
of us have experienced. Here, 
however, the anguish seemed to 
have been required of the broad- 
casters. Nothing happened till 
there was strong emotion. And 
then I pieced together one letter 
or syllable after another until it 
was complete — when it was, 
which was far from always, 
though too frequent and near- 
right to be all chance. 

Impressive, no doubt, but not 
as much as the headache and 
weariness. A telegram would be 
a lot easier and more dependable. 
As far as I’m concerned, my mot- 
to is: “Don’t telepath — tele- 
graph!” What’s still more annoy- 
ing is that I haven’t found a way 
to know my thoughts from those 
of others. It’s cost me money in 
card games, too! 

Psi is a nuisance. Every edi- 
tor knows and dreads theme cy- 
cles, when writers all over simul- 
taneously turn to the same idea. 

Right now, it’s psi. I wish 
they’d pstop. I’m psick of psi. 
Come on now — aren’t you?
