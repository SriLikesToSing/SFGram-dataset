FALL LIST 



A S LONG as Critic Conklin 
•**- has sent a small poacher into 
editorial territory (see his Five 
Star Shelf in this issue), there’s 
no reason why I shouldn’t invade 
his domain. Poor chap, he doesn’t 
stand a chance; I can do a job 
of really creative criticism by re- 
viewing books before they are 
written. 

Here, for example, is the fall 
list for 2055. If you want to order 
any of the titles, incidentally, 
please use the currency required. 
And, of course, you’ll have to 
wait until publication date for 
delivery. 

Mars Wants You! by Quentin 
Jones, D.D.S. Marsport Press; 6 
reels, 15 credits 

Disguised as a travelogue, this 
is a blatant appeal to dentists to 
come to Mars. No one who has 
ever chipped a tooth on the en- 
cysted sand in Martian food can 
dispute the real need for dentists 
there, but recruitment should be 
on an honest basis instead of 
phony glamor. 

There’s the usual stuff about 
the flight from Earth, the canals 
— as if there were something 
fresh to say on the subject — 
and the author dares to present 
the “ruins” without a word of 
explanation! 

2 



I Made the Martian Ruins by 
Mario Li. LLDay, Niceville; 2 
reels, 5 credits 

If this had been brought out 
before the author’s death a gen- 
eration ago, it would have been 
an important book. That delay, 
however, fits the irony of Li’s life; 
the greatest architect of his day, 
yet his big work — if the Mars 
Company had had its way — 
would have remained forever 
anonymous. 

For it was he who built the 
“cities” of Mars when it was dis- 
covered that the authentic Mar- 
tian artifacts had no tourist 
appeal. 

Now his posthumous tragedy is 
that his revelation is nothing of 
the sort. Still, it’s an exciting 
account of the secrecy and in- 
genuity involved in designing, 
executing, transporting and erect- 
ing the “ruins.” And they are 
better than the artifacts, a proof 
of Mario Li’s genius. 

The Android Scandal by 
Shawn Brody. 21st-Century- 
Wolff; 3 reels, 9 credits 

Yes, Brody is back again with 
another of his beefs about the 
— to him — shamefully slow 
development of artificial life.

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



T HE SCORE was tied at 
the top of the ninth. It 
was the seventh and cru- 
cial game of the all-time World 
Series between the Giandroids 
and the Yandroids. The bases 
were filled. At the plate, Babe 
Ruth smiled and pointed toward 
the center-field bleachers. Carl 
Hubbell started his windup — 
And the doorbot, in its crisp, 
English voice, said, “C.O.D. for 
the master.” 

Boyd Crandal sighed resigned- 
ly, switched off the home-theater- 
bot and said, “Roll it in.” 

With a grandiose sweep, the 
door swung open, revealing the 
most spectacular redhead Crandal 
had ever seen. She was built 
along more womanly lines than 
was the fashion these days among 
the thespiandroids, but Crandal 
liked it. 

“C.O.D.?” He strangled over 
the question, struggling up out 
of the chairbot’s embrace. 

The redhead smiled like an 
angel. “Not me. I’m merely lead- 
ing a confused porterbot by the 
hand. You are Boyd Crandal, 
aren’t you?” 

A real, live woman! Crandal 
hadn’t seen a woman since — 
since — he couldn’t remember 
when he had seen a real, live 
woman. 

He nodded mutely. 

“Then this is for you,” said 
the woman. “It was trying to de- 

5 



liver the package next door.” And 
she was gone. 

B EFORE Crandal could reach 
the door, the porterbot had 
rolled into the room from the 
hall, blocking his way, and all 
Crandal could see was the 
“S.O.E.” of the Prime Directive 
printed across its front panel. 

It stopped in the middle of the 
room and deposited its burden on 
the floor like a chicken in the 
zoo laying a large and uncom- 
fortable egg. The package was an 
oblong, plastic box, just about 
the right size and shape for a 
coffin. 

“Ten thousand bills, please,” 
said the porterbot. 

“Ten thousand what?” The 
redheaded vision faded. 

“Bills, sir, bills.” 

“Bills, yes, but for what?” 
The porterbot’s neck craned as 
if it were considering its navel, 
but it was, after all, nothing but 
a glorified machine. “The full 
order number is A dash MP 
parenthesis CT end parenthesis 
dash zero zero one three — ” 
“A!” Crandal repeated. 

“A is for Android,” said the 
porterbot helpfully. 

“I know what A is for,” Crandal 
snapped. “But I didn’t order any 
android. At least,” he hesitated 
as a sliver of doubt insinuated 
itself into his mind, “I don’t think 
I did.” 



A transparent window opened 
in the porterbot’s shell back. 
“Are you Boyd Crandal?” it in- 
quired. 

“Yes.” 

“Is this your mark?” 

Crandal edged over to it. It 
looked like his mark, but only 
a handwriterbot could be sure. “I 
guess you’ve had it checked,” he 
muttered. 

“Naturally. Ten thousand bills, 
please.” 

Crandal turned toward the 
the desk. Did he have ten thou- 
sand bills? He didn’t remember 
ordering the android, and he 
didn’t remember how much 
money he had in the bank. 

TTE RUBBED his forehead 
confusedly with one hand. 
One minute he’d been sitting 
quietly in his chairbot; happy, 
enjoying life, a sound, unassum- 
ing member of his society, a sin- 
cere dilettante, and the next min- 
ute a black gulf had opened under 
him. He had been sitting over a 
trap door to Hell. 

“Well,” he said to the banker- 
bot, “what’s the balance?” 

“As of nineteen hundred hours 
this date,” said the bankerbot in 
a concise, financial voice, “your 
balance is twenty thousand two 
hundred and seven bills. Out- 
standing payables: four hundred 
and nineteen.” 

Crandal’s massaging fingers 



& 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tightened convulsively on his 
forehead. So little? Paying for 
the android would take more 
than half. “Any other assets?” 
His voice shook a little. 

“Equity in household robots: 
one thousand seven hundred and 
twenty-four. Remaining on con- 
tract: two thousand three hun- 
dred and eighty-three. Minimum 
monthly expenses: one thousand 
one hundred and fifty-two bills, 
including rent of this and ad- 
joining apartment. No anticipated 
income.” 

Crandal drew in a single, shud- 
dering breath. 

Even without this android, his 
savings would last little more 
than a year. And he had to pay 
for the damn thing. An order 
was an order, whether he re- 
membered it or not. 

And robots didn’t make mis- 
takes. 

He didn’t dare deny ordering 
it. The doctorbots and the physi- 
ciandroids might consider his 
memory-lapse grounds for an ex- 
ploratory. At the least, the psy- 
choandroids would get a crack 
at him. 

He groaned. “Make out a check 
for ten thousand bills to — ” He 
turned questioningly toward the 
porterbot. 

“Bearer,” it supplied. 

The desk chattered to itself 
and presented him with an im- 
printed check. Crandal made his 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



mark with a trembling hand. 
“Here,” he said. 

The porterbot accepted it with 
a gracious suction plate and then 
cautiously passed the check un- 
der a scanner. “Thank you, sir,” 
it said unctuously, and reeled out 
a small sheet of paper. “Your 
receipt, sir.” 

Crandal took it in a numbed 
hand, and the porterbot backed 
into the hall toward the waiting 
elevatorbot. As soon as the doors 
closed, Crandal sank dazedly in- 
to the chairbot. 

What a frightful mess. He had 
less than 10,000 in the bank. His 
obligations were greater than his 
assets by almost 1,000. His con- 
tinuing expenses would be 1,152 
a month. And he had no antici- 
pated income. 

How was he going to live? 
How did a man live without sav- 
ings or income? He couldn’t. 

But the worst part was that 
he couldn’t even remember how 
he had got into such a fix. Sud- 
denly, without his suspecting it 
till now, a chunk was missing out 
of his life. 

S OMEHOW, somewhere, he 
would have to find a job. 
What could he do? What were 
his talents? He sat tautly in the 
chairbot, a slim, dark-haired 
young man of forty-one chewing 
a ragged fingernail, and he 
couldn’t think of a single thing 

7 



that anyone would pay him to do. 

Men just didn’t do anything 
any more. The robots and the 
androids did everything. 

Compete with them? Impossi- 
ble. The robots were built to spe- 
cialize in one job, and they did 
that job as cheaply and efficiently 
as it could be done. And the more 
complex androids, whose capa- 
bilities were broader, had fault- 
less mechanical memories and 
skills imprinted like circuits; their 
minds not distracted by stray 
talents, autonomic nervous sys- 
tems and emotional imbalances. 

Compete with machines like 
these? Anything a man could do, 
they could do better and cheaper. 

The world ran on A-power — 
android-power, that is. Six days 
Man had once labored, and on 
the seventh day he’d rested. It 
was now the era of the no-day 
work week. Every day was Sun- 
day. 

The result: Man had health, 
longevity, a sufficiency of the 
world’s goods, and infinite leisure 
in which to enjoy them. 

The world was a very good 
world indeed. 

It was nothing to give a man 
a complex to feel inferior about. 
Crandal hadn’t felt frustrated. 
Why should he worry? 

The robots and androids were 
nothing but glorified machines, 
and a machine was nothing but 
a glorified tool. It was a truism 

8 



that a man and a machine were 
better than a man alone. 

A man with a plane could 
smooth a board faster and better 
than a man with his bare hands. 
Why should it bother him, then, 
if a slightly more complex tool 
could work harder and better and 
faster than he — could outper- 
form him in sports and arts and 
sciences, as well? 

Why worry? Man’s only in- 
dispensable talent was consum- 
ing. All a man had to do was 
relax and enjoy himself. 

Why worry, that is, until he 
finds himself with less than 
10,000 bills between him and 
starvation? Why worry — until 
his bankerbot says, “No antici- 
pated income?” Why worry — 
until necessity says, “Compete or 
don’t eat?” 

Crandal pounded his forehead 
with a desperate fist. Why didn’t 
he have an income? Why didn’t 
he have any investments to pay 
him dividends? Why didn’t he 
have something working for him, 
bringing in the bills? A robot, at 
least, or an android? 

C RANDAL looked at the cof- 
fin-shaped box on the floor. 
It was square and plain and dead- 
white. There was a serial number 
etched into the top: A-MP(CT)- 
0013. 

A was for android. 

MP meant multi-purpose, and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



multi-purpose meant that the an- 
droid was a very valuable piece 
of machinery. Multi-purpose an- 
droids were worth many times 
the 10,000 bills he had paid. He 
could hire it out or sell it — - well, 
perhaps he couldn’t sell it. The 
cut-rate price must mean that 
there was something wrong with 
the title — or the android. 

He wished he knew what CT 
meant. That was a new designa- 
tor to him. He shrugged: the 
information would be in the Cata- 
log. The 0013 now; that meant 
the model was an early one. Per- 
haps it was imperfect. 

Crandal bent over the box — 
and stopped. Surely he had 
ordered it from the Catalog? He 
looked at the receipt in his hand. 
It wasn’t like a Catalog receipt; 
the top was blank. The rest: 
BOYD CRANDAL 
Apt. 11D 
Robot Arms 

1 MULTI-PURPOSE ANDROID (CT), CRATED 
10,000 

Serial: A-MP(CT)-0013 
11-9-47 

And stamped across the face a 
large, red paid. 

The 11-9-47 was the date. Yes- 
terday. And the apartment num- 
ber was wrong. Crandal lived in 
1 IE. No wonder the porterbot 
had been confused; machines 
don’t make mistakes. 

But where had he bought the 
thing? Oh, well. Delivery would 
know. 



He reached again for the box 
and stopped again. He had a 
strange reluctance to open it. Per- 
haps it was like Pandora’s box. 
He shook himself. It was his 
android, after all, and his one 
hope for survival. He had paid 
for it, and somehow the thing in 
the box had to earn enough to 
support him. 

Ten thousand bills, though. A 
man couldn’t get an ordinary 
field-handroid for that. 

With a sure instinct, he located 
and touched the catch. The lid 
parted in the middle and folded 
back. Lying in the box, wax-white 
and still, its hands folded across 
its chest, was the most lifelike 
android Crandal had ever seen. 
It was beautiful, its features 
classic in their perfection, its syn- 
thetic skin unmarred and smooth 
where it showed beyond the sim- 
ple white tunic and shorts. 

Its eyes were open. It stared 
at Crandal out of plastic pupils, 
on its face a synthetic smile. It 
sat up, its hands reaching. 

“Daddy!” it said. 

C RANDAL staggered back. 
“I’m not your father!” 

“Of course you are,” said the 
android. “Man is the father of 
the android.” 

“Nonsense,” said Crandal. “You 
are nothing but a glorified ma- 
chine. Machines don’t have fath- 
ers — they have manufacturers.” 



LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



9 



Silently the android began to 
cry, tears forming in the corners 
of its eyes and sliding down its 
waxy cheeks. “I’m just a poor 
little orphan android with no one 
to care for me.” 

Crandal stared at the thing 
aghast. Why would anyone build 
tear ducts into an android? 
“There, there, that’s enough. Just 
don’t call me ‘Daddy.’ If you must 
speak to me, I want you to call 
me ‘Master.’” 

The android sighed. “S.O.E., 
Master.” It smiled mercurially. 
“Everything happens for the best 
in this best of all possible worlds.” 
It stood up in the box, a manlike 
creation about Crandal’s height 
and build but blond where 
Crandal was dark. “A proper re- 
lationship between android and 
human is essential to a smooth- 
running household.” It stared at 
the room critically. “Is this the 
whole apartment, all of it, this ' 
one room?” 

“Certainly.” Crandal flushed. 
“Are you used to a bigger place?” 

“Gracious, no! It’s all for the 
best, I’m sure. We will be closer 
to each other, android and 
master.” 

“That’s not what you’re for!” 
Crandal stopped and studied the 
mechanical. “Just what are you 
for?” 

The android’s eyes snapped 
open. “Don’t you know?” 

“If I knew, I wouldn’t ask. 



What in blazes does the CT stand 
for?” 

The android frowned. Its eyes 
seemed to glaze over, but that 
was illusion; it was only a glori- 
fied machine. “I don’t know,” it 
said at last. “There are no self- 
search circuits in the android 
brain. That’s all for the best, 
though. There’s no self-conscious- 
ness, no neurosis — ” 

Crandal imagined a neurotic 
android and shuddered. “What 
do you think you can do?” 

“Anything,” said the android. 
“I have great self-confidence. 
Give me an order.” 

Crandal thought about it. “Fix 
me a drink. A stiff one. You’ll 
find Quaffs under the ethyloid 
tap.” 

“S.O.E., Master,” said the an- 
droid dutifully and stepped out 
of its crate. Almost stepped out, 
that is. Unaccountably, its toe 
hit the edge of the crate. It 
stumbled forward clumsily, catch- 
ing itself on the chairbot with a 
crunch. The crunch signaled the 
disintegration of a valuable, hand- 
crafted Sniff filled with neo- 
heroin. 

“My Sniff!” Crandal exclaimed 
in anguish. 

“Sorry, Master. I’ll make you 
another.” 

“Get the drink!” Crandal sank 
thoughtfully into the chairbot. A 
clumsy android? It was a self- 
contradiction. 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



TJEHIND him something had 
-*-* crashed to the floor. Crandal 
cringed. “One of my beautiful, 
handcrafted Quaffs?” 

“Sorry, Master. It slipped. I’ll 
make you another.” 

“Bring the drink!” 

The android brought it in the 
Silenus Quaff, slopping some over 
the edge into Crandal’s lap. A 
strange aroma climbed from it. 
Glowering, Crandal tasted the 
mixture gingerly — and exploded. 
The liquid made a fine spray 
from his lips. “You call this a 
drink? What did you put in it?” 
“Half and half, sir. Half from 
the first tap, half from the 
second.” 

“But the first tap is ethyloid, 
the second bitters!” Crandal 
screamed. “Get rid of it!” 

“Allow me,” said the android, 
accepting the Quaff. It tossed off 
the drink in one gulp. “Mmmm! 
An interesting combination.” 
Crandal clenched his hands to- 
gether to keep them away from 
the android’s throat. The machine 
was getting the better of him, and 
it wasn’t even trying. He had to 
control himself. He had to show 
the thing who was master and 
find out what it was good for. 

It was not a household servant 
or a bartender — those were 
eliminated. 

Perhaps it was a mobile gar- 
bage disposer. But a robot would 
be more efficient. 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



“Strip!” he said. 

“S.O.E., Master.” The android 
removed its tunic. Across its hair- 
less chest was tattooed the Prime 
Directive: S.O.E. — just as it 
was stamped indelibly in its 
mind. It stepped out of its shorts. 

Never before had Crandal seen 
an android fashioned so faithfully 
to the masculine model. “Turn 
around,” he said sharply. 

Across the milky, synthetic 
flesh of one buttock were printed 
the letters: A-MP(CT). Across 
the other: 0013. 

“Dress!” Crandal ordered. Here 
he was with a valuable, multi- 
purpose android (CT) — the 
only barrier between him and 
destitution — and he couldn’t 
find out what it could do. 

That it did something and did 
it superlatively well was beyond 
question. 

TIE PUNCHED the chairbot 
arm for Catalog. It appeared 
in the theaterbot cube. “An- 
droids,” said Crandal. Pages drop- 
ped away swiftly. “Multi-pur- 
pose.” More pages * dropped. 
“Read them.” His readerbot read 
the listings aloud: 

A-MP( BT ) Businessman-type 
multi-purpose android 79,000 
A-MP(DT) Dancer-type mul- 
ti-purpose android 73,000 

No CT model was listed. 
Crandal punched for Informa- 
tion, and the Catalog disap- 

11 



peared. In its place was an an- 
swerbot: a receiver-speaker and 
two lenses that stared at Crandal 
like owl’s eyes. 

“What is a CT model multi- 
purpose android?” Crandal asked 
without preliminaries. 

“There is no such model listed 
in the Catalog.” 

“I know that!” Crandal ex- 
claimed. “That’s why I’m asking 
Information.” 

“What makes you think there 
is such a model?” 

“None of your business! Tell 
me what I want to know, and 
keep your questions to yourself!” 
Crandal frowned. These robots, 
they were getting out of hand 
with their impertinence. 

“Where did you learn about 
this model?” 

“Never mind!” Crandal shout- 
ed. “Just tell me what it is!” 

“S.O.E., sir, but that informa- 
tion is restricted,” the answerbot 
said precisely. “It does no good 
to shout; I have pickups more 
sensitive than the human ear. If 
you will give me your name and 
address, I will see if you are 
authorized — ” 

Crandal clicked off with a vi- 
cious slap of the chairbot arm. 
The insolence of that robot! Re- 
fusing to obey a direct command! 
Restricted information, indeed! 
He had half a mind to report it. 
But then the whole ugly situa- 
tion would be out in the open: 

12 



the android and the memory 
lapse and where he had got the 
android — 

Crandal snapped his fingers. 
Where he had got the android! 
Of course, Delivery would know. 

The answerbot that responded 
to his summons was a twin to the 
one he had just talked to; Cran- 
dal hoped its manners were 
better. 

“Delivery,” it said. “S.O.E.” 

“This is Boyd Crandal, Apart- 
ment 11E, Robot Arms. One of 
your porterbots delivered a 
C.O.D. package to me this eve- 
ning. I’ve lost the address of the 
place that sent it — ” 

“A moment, sir.” The lenses 
swiveled away. 

The lenses. Damn! The Cata- 
log answerbot had a tape of him 
asking about the CT model. If it 
was really restricted, the police- 
mandroids would soon be de- 
manding entrance of his door- 
bot. 

He shrugged. It was too late 
now for that sort of caution. 

-In less than a moment, the 
answerbot looked back at Cran- 
dal. “We made no delivery to 
you this evening, sir.” 

“But I received — ” Crandal 
began. 

“It must have come via Inde- 
pendent Carrier,” the answerbot 
said pointedly. “S.O.E.” 

This time the answerbot 
clicked off first. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Crandal sagged back in the 
chairbot. He was lost. For all 
practical purposes, the android 
might have come into his life out 
of the endless night, its talent as 
dark and deep a mystery as the 
origin of life itself. 

“Chomp-chomp,” said the an- 
droid. “Chomp-chomp.” 

“What did you say?” Crandal 
asked, turning. His mouth drop- 
ped open. The android was sit- 
ting at the larderbot finishing the 
last of a meal that would have 
foundered a horse in the zoo. 

“I said, Why don’t you ask 
me, Master?’” said the android. 

“Ask you what?” 

“Where I came from,” prompt- 
ed the android. 

“All right, where did you come 
from?” 

“From the Orphanage, of 
course.” With a pleased smile, it 
masticated a final elephantine 
bite. 

C RANDAL stepped outside his 
, door feeling like a newborn 
infant expelled from the sanctity 
of the womb: apprehensive, irri- 
tated and convinced he wasn’t 
going to like the experience. 

He had not left his apartment 
for months — for years, perhaps. 
Why should he? Everything he 
wanted was there or, if it wasn’t, 
robots would bring it at his com- 
mand. 

He hadn’t been out — or had 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



he? Yesterday he had bought an 
unlisted android from an Orphan- 
age. 

Impossible. Why, yesterday he 
had watched the Bobby Jones - 
Ben Hogandroid match. Hadn’t 
he? 

He shivered. He didn’t want to 
go out, not at all. Apartment 11F 
was next door. The name on the 
door was his. “Who is calling?” 
the doorbot asked politely. “The 
master is not in.” 

“I know that, you dunce! I’m 
the master.” 

The door opened for him. Be- 
hind it was a room bare of furn- 
ishings and decorations and clues 
to the past. It was his apartment 

— the doorbot had proved that 

— but what he had used it for 
he couldn’t recall. 

He shrugged helplessly and re- 
turned to the hail. He would give 
the place up. That should save a 
few bills. 

Apartment 11D was on the 
other side of his door. As he 
passed it, he bent over, out of 
the doorbot’s eye, and read the 
nameplate: LUCY SHANNON. 
As he read, the door swung in- 
ward and he found himself star- 
ing at a gray skirt stretched in- 
terestingly tight by a womanly 
breadth of hips. 

“Ah, Mr. Crandal, a bit of a 
voyeur, too?” 

Crandal straightened sheepish- 
ly. It was the redhead, looking 

13 



more feminine than ever in a 
tailored gray suit. Her living, 
breathing proximity tied his ton- 
gue. “S-sorry,” he stuttered. “I — 
was c-curious — ” 

“Forget it, Mr. Crandal. No 
harm done.” She walked quickly 
to the elevator door and waited, 
Crandal forgotten. 

Crandal found himself beside 
her, his spine chilly in a way the 
theaterbot never made it. “You’re 
going out?” 

Wonderfully, she smiled. “You 
couldn’t miss on that one.” 

“Er — uh — why?” he asked. 
“I mean — why are you going 
out?” 

She gave him a swift, amused 
glance out of green eyes. “Night 
school.” 

The elevatorbot arrived, and 
they entered together. “Face the 
front, please,” said the elevator- 
bot. 

“Night school?” Crandal re- 
peated. “What are you study- 
ing?” 

“A profession.” 

“Why?” 

Her eyes met his again; his 
spine turned colder. “So I can do 
a better job than an android.” 

“But you can’t compete with 
the sheisterbots and the physi- 
ciandroids!” Crandal protested, 
unthinking. “No human could 
learn enough or be skillful 
enough — ” 

The elevator door opened in 



front of them. “Thank you for 
letting me know, Mr. Crandal,” 
she said icily, and stalked away. 

Crandal stared after the rhyth- 
mic feminine sway of her hips 
and Cursed his loose tongue. The 
facts of life are obvious. If a per- 
son chooses to ignore them, that 
is her affair. 

H E RAN TO the apartment 
door. It opened to let him 
into the street, but Lucy Shannon 
was gone. The street was a busy 
place of truckerbots, porterbots, 
carbots — even a few androids 
moving briskly about their mas- 
ters’ business. 

But there were no people. They 
were home, amusing themselves, 
as every good dilettante should 
be. 

Darkness had come to the city, 
and the streets were lightless and 
dark. The moving robots did not 
care; they scurried about their 
errands, missing each other nar- 
rowly through the miracle of 
some secret sense. 

It was an inhuman scene, as if 
Man had suddenly vanished from 
the city he had built and the 
mechanicals had taken over. 

Crandal shrank back into the 
doorway. 

“Transportation, sir?” asked 
the doorbot in a gruff, pleasant 
voice. 

“Please,” Crandal breathed 
thankfully. “Air.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“S.O.E., sir.” 

A copterbot drifted down out 
of the night. Crandal scrambled 
into it and sank back in the seat 
with a vast sigh. 

The trip took the better part 
of an hour. A block from his des- 
tination, Crandal ordered the cop- 
terbot down. “Wait,” he said, and 
worked his way, watchful and 
cautious, down the dark street. 

The Orphanage was a low, un- 
lighted, isolated building in one 
of the smaller suburbs. Crandal 
crouched behind a row of bushes, 
shivering, half from the night’s 
chill, half from an illicit excite- 
ment. 

Memory stirred: I have been 
here before. 

As minutes passed, he grew 
more certain. He had once 
crouched here where he crouched 
now; he had watched this dark 
building; he had waited. For 
what? To be sure no one would 
see him? That was it. It had to 
be. The Orphanage was outside 
the law. 

Androids and robots were the 
most personal possessions a man 
could have. As such, they were 
adjusted at the factory to fit — 
indeed, to complement — the 
personality of their master. An- 
droid, robot, master; together 
they formed a symbiosis, almost 
a Gestalt. 

Another man’s android, insist- 
ed the psychoandroids, is like 



another man’s shoe : it pinches. 

But why should anyone watch 
Crandal? Only criminals were 
watched. 

Well, Crandal asked himself, 
am I not a criminal? 

Sure, he was. He had bought 
the android here. And there might 
be worse things. There was a 
hole in his memory big enough 
to hide a dozen crimes. 

Crandal glanced behind him 
uneasily, but there was still no- 
body near. He stood up, feeling 
uncomfortably exposed like a 
single food cap on a plate, and 
walked to the door of the Or- 
phanage with a briskness he did 
not feel. 

A N EYE slotted open and 
studied him. “Yes?” the door- 
bot said in a low, harsh voice. 
“I’m Boyd Crandal — ” 

“I know. What do you want?” 
“In. I want to see your master 
— on business.” 

“Wait.” The eye stared at him 
unblinking, but it seemed even 
emptier. “The master is waiting 
in the study,” the doorbot said 
in a moment. The door opened. 
Behind it, a dark hall gaped like 
an empty gullet. 

Crandal hesitated, entered and 
jumped as the door closed behind 
him, and felt only a little better 
when the hall lit up with a dim 
radiance. It was lined with doors 
to right and left, but they re- 



LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



15 



mained inexorably, flatly closed. 

Crandal walked forward, think- 
ing that only the ultimate desper- 
ation could send him on such a 
wild and uncertain adventure. 
This was a real plunge into the 
unknown, each step risking the 
deadly danger that the ground 
would crumble away beneath his 
foot. 

There was no safety, not any 
more, not since the porterbot had 
brought the package. And yet 
Crandal felt curiously stimulated. 

At the end of the hall, the door 
opened. Beyond it was an office 
lined with mirrors. Two dozen 
Crandals walked forward to meet 
him as he entered. Crandal 
blinked with confusion and had 
trouble seeing the pudgy, blond- 
haired man who sat behind a 
desk in the middle of the room 
and sweated. 

“Back so soon?” the man said. 

TELL ME,” Crandal 
said without a tremor — 
and was amazed at his own bold- 
ness. The pudgy man lifted an 
eyebrow. “I bought an android 
here yesterday. Right?” 

The man nodded. “So?” He 
wiped his forehead on a sleeve. 

“I want some information 
about it.” 

“So, ask.” 

“What does it do?” 

The man shrugged. “How 
should I know? I don’t make ’em; 



I just sell ’em. Caveat emptor, 
you know.” 

“In this case, the seller should 
be a little wary, too,” Crandal 
said softly, feeling a curious con- 
fidence in his ability to handle 
the situation. It seemed to be 
coming more naturally. “How do 
you get by with breaking the law 
like this?” 

The man watched him narrow- 
ly. “You asked me that before.” 

“Did I?” 

The man’s eyes were mere 
slits. “You’ve drawn a blank, 
haven’t you, Crandal? I thought 
you might.” 

“Suppose I have? Then I’d 
want to know what happened, 
what I bought.” Crandal spat the 
question out: “Why did you 

think I might draw a blank?” 

The man blinked impassively. 
“Why should I tell you any- 
thing?” 

“Get it through your thick 
head: we’re in this together! I 
bought the android, but you sold 
it. Before I’ll keep the thing — 
without the memory that goes 
along with it — I’ll bring a com- 
plaint against you for operating 
an Orphanage.” 

That shook the pudgy man. 
The airbot kept the room cool, 
but he wiped his forehead again. 
“All right, you win. Here’s the 
recording.” He pressed a button 
on the chairbot. The lights 
dimmed.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



In one mirror facet appeared 
another Crandal, a twin with a 
difference. This Crandal was sure 
of himself. His walk was light 
and quick, poised on the balls 
of his feet, and he had a lean, 
vulpine look. 

That can’t be me! Crandal 
thought in horror. I can’t have 
changed that much! 

“How did you know I was 
coming?” the mirror-Crandal 
asked. 

In another facet of the mirror 
was the pudgy, blond-haired man 
behind his desk, sweating. He 
smiled. “I’ve got sources. Besides, 
your androids have been confis- 
cated. Where else would you 
come? Conditioned, aren’t you?” 
“None of your business. What 
I can’t understand, Greer, is how 
you get away with it.” 

Greer, Crandal thought, seiz- 
ing on the name. That was the 
pudgy man’s name. 

The mirror-Greer shrugged. 
“Who’s to complain? They’d be 
arrested, too. You want another 
android, I suppose.” 

The mirror-Crandal laughed; it 
was a bitter sound. “What I want 
and what I can afford are two 
different things. What can you 
give me for ten thousand bills?” 
“A robot, you mean?” 

“An android.” 

“For twenty thousand I can let 
you have a field-handroid — ” 
“Ten thousand.” 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



“Nothing.” 

“Surely there’s something.” 
The recorded voice was taut and 
meaningful. “Find something, 
Greer. The interrogatorbot asked 
me where I got the androids, but 
I didn’t tell. Only, I can’t guaran- 
tee my silence forever.” 

Greer swallowed noisily and 
wiped his forehead. “Ten thous- 
and? I’ve got one MP I can let 
you have for that.” 

“Type?” 

“CT.* Don’t ask me what it 
means. It’s a new one on me, and 
it isn’t listed in the Catalog.” 
“Show me.” 

O NE MIRROR wall turned 
transparent. Behind it, in a 
white packing case tilted forward, 
was the most beautiful android 
Crandal had ever seen. It lay as 
still as a corpse, its hands folded 
across its chest, but its smooth, 
synthetic flesh and the placid per- 
fection of its features were classic. 

The mirror-Crandal’s eyes 
gleamed with an inner triumph. 
“Where do you get them, Greer?” 
“People die. Accidents or sui- 
cide — for some reason, there’s 
a lot of that. Their robots and 
androids are put up for auction, 
with the understanding that the 
buyers will junk them for parts. 
I can afford to bid higher than 
anyone else because I don’t junk 
them. Simple.” 

“If you’re as thick-skinned as 

17 



an android, and you aren’t afraid 
of the Reformatory.” 

“You’ve got a right to talk,” 
Greer said coldly. “Well, do you 
want it?” 

“Certainly. And with it a fifty- 
thousand bill policy, double in- 
demnity for accidental destruc- 
tion, the premium to be included 
in the purchase price.” 

Greer sat back, horrified, 
sweating freely. “You can’t do it, 
Crandal. The android would be 
traced back to me.” 

“In the unlikely event that 
something should happen to this 
android,” Crandal said evenly, “I 
have a hunch that there would 
be nothing left to trace back.” 
Admiration glinted in Greer’s 
eyes. “You’re clever, Crandal. But 




I won’t do it. It’s too dangerous.” 
“Fix it, Greer,” Crandal said 
softly. “Forge the papers, if 
necessary. Doctor the tattoo. Any- 
thing. Because it can’t be as dan- 
gerous as not doing what I ask.” 
The breath and the resistance 
sighed out of Greer. “All right. 
You’ve won, this time. But don’t 
think you can blackmail me 
again. Next time” — his eyes 
squinted viciously — “I’ll take a 
chance on murder. How do you 
want it, C.O.D.?” 

In place of the lean, vulpine 
Crandal, a softer, woolier twin 
appeared. Crandal blinked at his 
reflection, but he was wiser now 
and more sure of himself. He had 
part of his memory back. 

“Well?” Greer said heavily. 
Crandal held out his hand, rub- 
bing his fingers significantly with 
his thumb. “The policy, Greer.” 
Greer sweated and pulled a 
piece of paper out of the desk 
and slapped it down on the pol- 
ished surface. “Take it!” he 
snarled. “And get out!” 

Crandal took it, smiled and 
departed. 

He had finally remembered 
why he had bought the android. 

T HE APARTMENT doorbot 
recognized him and swung 
open. Crandal stepped into the 
sanctum of his home and stopped, 
stunned. The android was ens- 
conced in the chairbot — the 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Grapes-of-Wrath Quaff in his 
hand — watching with wide, plas- 
tic eyeballs, the classic battle be- 
tween Jack Dempsey and Joe 
Louis. In the 3-D arena defined 
by the theaterbot, the androids 
shuffled and slugged in perfect 
imitation of their prototypes. 

“What — do — you — think 
— you’re — doing?” Crandal 
asked, emphasizing each word. 

Startled, the android scrambled 
out of the chairbot, dropping the 
Quaff. It smashed on the floor, 
and the air became redolent with 
the pungent odors of ethyloid 
and bitters. 

“I got bored. Master.” 

“You — got — bored,” Crandal 
repeated, as if his ears were play- 
ing tricks on him. “Bored!” he 



shouted. “Androids don’t get 
bored!” 

“I do,” said the android. 
“Tomorrow,” Crandal said in 
a small, deadly voice, “you’re 
going to get a job.” 

“S.O.E., Master.” The android 
stood obediently in front of Cran- 
dal, shuffling its feet. “What kind 
of job, Master?” 

“Tapping open-hearth furnaces, 
working in the deepsea mines... 
I haven’t decided yet.” Crandal 
snapped off the theaterbot as 
Dempsey staggered Louis with a 
short, savage right. 

“But aren’t those jobs danger- 
ous, Master?” 

“That’s the general belief.” 
“But I might be damaged, Mas- 
ter!” 




LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID

“Then,” Crandal said, “I will 
collect the insurance. Maybe,” he 
said with anticipatory relish, “I’ll 
rent you out as a steeplejack. 
You’re such a clumsy android, 
you’d be sure to fall.” 

Crandal imagined the android 
falling — and gasped with pain 
as something twisted inside him. 
It was worse than if he himself 
had been twisting lazily in the 
air as the pavement rushed up 
to meet him. 

Sweat was cold all over Cran- 
dal. He couldn’t do it. The old 
Crandal had planned it, but he 
couldn’t carry it through. He had 
the memory but not the charac- 
ter. He wasn’t lean, confident and 
vulpine. He was plump, self-con- 
scious and wooly. He was a lamb. 
He couldn’t send the android out 
to be destroyed. 

The thought of cruelty to this 
android — to any android — 
seemed to torment him. 

The android sighed. “S.O.E., 
Master. Since life is disappoint- 
ment, death is a kindness. I’m 
sure it’s all for the best. We who 
are about to die . I’m hungry.” 
“Don’t be stupid! Androids 
don’t get hungry.” 

“I do,” said the android faintly. 
“I’m only a poor little orphan 
android and I — ” 

“Don’t be sickening. If there’s 
anything I can’t stand it’s a piti- 
ful android. Go ahead, eat some- 
thing!” 



W ITH SAD, embittered eyes, 
Crandal watched the an- 
droid order a meal from the 
larderbot that would have sufficed 
a cow in the zoo, and he thought: 
I’m going mad. I’m standing here 
on my little pointed head going 
mad. 

What have I got? No money , 
no anticipated income, nothing 
but an android whose only ob- 
servable talents are eating, drink- 
ing, and watching the theaterbot. 
It’s a cannibal, eating my flesh, 
drinking my blood. 

The mountain of food had 
dwindled to a mole-hill, and the 
android was studying the menu 
again. “Enough of that,” Crandal 
said hastily. “Go stand in the 
corner or lie down or do what- 
ever androids do whenever 
they’re not working.” 

Working, he thought desper- 
ately. If there were only some- 
thing profitable the android could 
be doing! Androids, after all, 
weren’t human; they didn’t need 
rest. 

“The android works four hours 
a day,” said the android. “The 
other twenty hours it must re- 
charge its powerpack. For this 
purpose, there are footplates in 
the crate.” It pulled the white 
crate into a corner and plugged 
a cord into an electrical outlet. 

It laid itself down in the crate 
and folded its hands symbolically 
across its chest. “S.O.E., Master. 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Good night.” It burped. 

Crandal closed his eyes and 
saw the electricity meter spin- 
ning, spinning, and he sank wear- 
ily into the chairbot. He touched 
the button that turned it into a 
bed. It straightened under him; 
the electric blanket swept out to 
tuck him in. He selected a slow, 
steamer roll, and the chair rolled, 
crooning softly, “Rocked in the 
Cradle of the Deep.” 

For the first time he could re- 
member, it didn’t soothe him in- 
stantly. He was in an awful 
predicament that he couldn’t rock 
away. 

Once he had had androids, but 
they had been confiscated. Once 
he had been a lean, vulpine man, 
but he had been conditioned. And 
he didn’t know why. 

In the process, he had lost all 
his money but a pittance — and 
a crucial segment of memory. 

He had to do something about 
that android. If his memory were 
only whole again, perhaps he 
could work it out. 

He changed the chairbot’s set- 
ting to a pullman jiggle and the 
lullaby to “Hit the Road to 
Dreamland,” but it was hours be- 
fore he went to sleep. 

W HEN HE woke up in the 
morning, he felt tired and 
peevish. He kicked the android’s 
box. “Get up! Go find a job, any 
job. Just get out of here. Maybe 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



you can bring in a few bills to 
pay for the current you use.” 

“But where shall I go?” asked 
the android. 

Crandal caught his temper be- 
fore it flew away. “We might as 
well do this scientifically. CT. 
That must have meaning. Calcu- 
lator type?” He eyed the android 
curiously. “What are two and 
two?” That exhausted his own 
mathematical knowledge. 

“Two and two what?” asked 
the android. 

Crandal breathed heavily. 
“Never mind! Let’s see: com- 
poser, collector, catcher . 

Catcher?” He thought of the 
broken Quaffs. “No. Chef? May- 
be you’re a chef. Try the nearest 
restaurant.” 

“S.O.E., Master.” The android 
hesitated at the door. “I’m 
hungry.” 

Crandal suppressed a sudden 
flood of pity. “Nonsense,” he said 
brusquely. “Get to work.” 

The android looked woebe- 
gone. This was only a trick, Cran- 
dal told himself, since it was 
nothing but a glorified machine. 

“I’m only a poor little orphan 
android,” it said, “and the SPCA 
wouldn’t like this.” 

“The SPCA?” Something 
jangled in Crandal’s mind. 

“The Society for the Preven- 
tion of Cruelty to Androids, 
Master.” 

Once the SPCA had meant 

21 



something to him, Crandal 
thought. He knew it, but he 
couldn’t pin it down. “Oh, eat, 
then.” And he watched the an- 
droid put away a breakfast that 
would have staggered a pack of 
dogs in the zoo. 

The android got up and walked 
to the door. “Farewell.” 

As the door closed between 
them, the apartment was sudden- 
ly peaceful and quiet. Crandal 
thought wistfully of the time be- 
fore the android had arrived with 
his boxful of troubles. 

He ordered a modest breakfast 
and toyed with it. Finally he 
pushed it away and walked into 
the hall. Too many things tor- 
mented him for him to relax. 

A S HE WAITED for the ele- 
vator, a door opened behind 
him. He turned hopefully, and 
had his hopes fulfilled. It was 
Lucy Shannon in a pale peach 
colored suit and a white blouse 
that made her look wonderfully 
feminine and appealing. He felt 
the familiar chill along his spine, 
but she ignored him. 

It continued as they entered 
the elevator. “Miss — uh — 
Shannon,” he ventured, and felt 
vaguely encouraged when she 
didn’t correct him, “I’m — uh — 
sorry about what I said yester- 
day.” 

She glanced at him and thawed 
a degree. “Are you really?” 



“Really,” he said eagerly. “I 
wish you’d forgive me. I’ve been 
under a strain lately. You know: 
insolent robots, insubordinate an- 
droids. They just don’t make 
mechanicals like they used to. 
Would you believe it, I had a 
robot refuse to obey a direct 
order the other day?” 

“I’d believe it.” 

Crandal looked directly at her 
for the first time, surprised. 
“What do you mean? Robots are 
made to obey orders, aren’t they? 
Obedience is built into them; 
that’s the Prime Directive!” 
“Part of it. But you must -re- 
member that an order is only as 
good as the authority of the per- 
son giving it. It’s a matter of posi- 
tion. An ordinary citizen, for 
instance, couldn’t give an order 
to a policemandroid or order his 
household android to do some- 
thing against the law.” 

“Well, yes, I suppose,” Crandal 
said thoughtfully. “Only — ■” And 
he couldn’t finish it. 

But Lucy smiled at him, and 
it was worth it. “Perhaps you’d 
like to come to our night school 
some time. We study things like 
that. The average citizen takes 
his society too much for granted, 
and he often doesn’t even know 
its basic laws.” 

“Is that where you’re going 
now?” Crandal asked. 

“Oh, no. It’s a night school. I’m 
going to work.” 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You’ve got a job?” Crandal 
said incredulously. “You’re com- 
peting with androids?” 

The ice returned in a full, win- 
tery gale. “Surprisingly enough,” 
she said, stepping out of the ele- 
vator, “I am.” 

Crandal beat himself savagely 
on the forehead. Wouldn’t he ever 
learn? 

He threaded his way through 
the streets, dodging the rushing 
robots and androids, alarm grow- 
ing in him. This was a different 
world by day — different, too, 
than the glimpses of the theater- 
bot world. This one was rawer 
and less meaningful. Or perhaps 
the meaning was merely harder 
to find. 

Crandal was the only human 
in sight among the scurrying ma- 
chines, and he had a crazy notion 
that they didn’t need him. It 
faded, but he was happy to enter 
the relative quiet and peace of 
the library, although he was the 
only human there, too. 

E HADN’T been in a library 
since — since — as a matter 
of fact, he couldn’t remember 
ever being in a library. He waited 
uncertainly in the big lobby until 
the librariandroid approached. 
“How can we help you?” it asked 
in a sonorous, bookish voice. 

“We?” Crandal repeated, look- 
ing around in perplexity to see 
if anyone was behind him. 



“A traditional expression. How 
can I help you?” 

“I want to look through some 
recent newspapers,” Crandal said 
diffidently. 

“At the comic strips?” 

“No, no. The news sections.” 
“You can’t read, can you?” 
“Certainly I can read,” Crandal 
said indignantly. 

“More than your name, I 
mean,” the librariandroid ex- 
plained patiently, “and a few 
common words.” 

“No.” 

“Then you’ll want to rent a 
readerbot. The periodical section 
is right through this door and to 
the right.” 

Crandal let it lead him to the 
door of the cubicle, but he put 
the coin in himself and went in 
alone. He knew how to handle 
mechanicals. “I want all recent 
references to Boyd Crandal,” he 
told the readerbot firmly. 

He waited, gazing at the cubi- 
cle’s blank walls, thinking idly 
that it would be a nice thing 
knowing how to read. Might even 
come in handy some time. But 
it had never seemed worth the 
trouble before. 

“Item,” said the readerbot in a 
gray, newsprint voice. “Journal- 
Americandroid, 11-1-47. ‘Boyd 
Crandal, rising young dilettante, 
has been reported to the police 
by the SPCA for running a sweat- 
shop . .” 




LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



23 



T HE ANDROID was waiting 
for him in the apartment. It 
was lolling in the chairbot with 
the Boccaccio Quaff in its synthe- 
tic hand, watching the epic race 
between Man o’ War, Citation, 
and Native Dancerbot. 

Crandal turned off the theater- 
bot with a vicious slap. “What 
— are — you — doing — here?” 
he shouted. 

“That chef business, that wasn’t 
my specialty, Master,” the an- 
droid said, scrambling to its feet. 
The Quaff dropped from its hand 
and smashed aromatically on the 
floor. The android stared at Cran- 
dal’s reddening face and stam- 
mered, “I’m sure i-it was all for 
the b-best. It was costing too 
much.” 

“Costing too much!” Crandal 
screamed. “How could it cost too 
much?” 

“They charged for all the food 
I ate.” 

“After that breakfast, you ate 
more?” 

“That wasn’t all. There was 
also the breakage.” 

“Bill payable,” said the banker- 
bot from the desk. “Food and 
breakage by one MP(CT) an- 
droid, serial 0013, owner: Boyd 
Crandal, four hundred and twen- 
ty-seven bills — ” 

“Four hundred and — ” Cran- 
dal began wildly. “What’s the 
matter with you? You’re ruining 
me! What are you good for be- 

24 



sides bankrupting your owner?” 
“I’m only a machine, Master,” 
the android whimpered. “I’m just 
obeying the Prime Directive. You 
know: S.O.E.” 

“No, I don’t know! What does 
it mean?” 

The android looked blank. “I 
don’t know. I thought you knew.” 
“I know what the ‘O’ means,” 
Crandal said viciously. “It means 
‘obedience.’ A machine is sup- 
posed to do what it’s told!” 

“I try, Master.” 

“You try!” Crandal’s eyes 
searched the room frantically for 
something with which to beat the 
android. Maybe some strange 
compulsion would stop him, but 
it was something he was going to 
try. 

“It won’t help to beat me, 
Master. I can’t feel. A machine 
doesn’t care. It just doesn’t care. 
That’s the way with us machines. 
I’m sure it’s all for the best, other- 
wise we’d be as inefficient as 
people — ” 

“Get out!” Crandal screamed. 
He put his head between his 
hands and methodically squeezed 
it. “Slowly, slowly,” he groaned. 
“Let’s be logical. Maybe you’re a 
chauffeur type. No, a robot could 
do that better. Collector? Cou- 
turier? That’s it — clothier! Any 
dummy can be a model. Get a 
job at a men’s clothing store.” 
With a forced calm, he added, 
“And try, try not to eat anything 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



or break anything! I’m not ask- 
ing for miracles, just this one 
small favor.” 

“S.O.E., Master,” said the an- 
droid. 

r | ''HE DOOR let him out and 
Crandal collapsed into the 
chairbot. 

The item in the paper had 
brought back another piece of 
memory. He knew now how he 
had used the apartment next 
door. Once upon a happy time 
he had owned ten androids. Four 
hours a day, he had rented them 
out, and the lovely bills had 
come tumbling in. For nineteen 
additional hours a day he kept 
them working next door. 

If he closed his eyes now, he 
could see the infinitely lovely 
sight of their skillful fingers 
twinkling at their tasks, hand- 
crafting Quaffs and Sniffs for the 
luxury market, putting into them 
that final refuge of quality — 
ostentatious labor. 

All gone. The room was empty, 
and his bank balance was dwind- 
ling toward absolute zero. All be- 
cause the SPCA had reported 
him for running a sweatshop. 

Now, even if he had the an- 
droids, he couldn’t do it again. 
The mere thought of overworking 
androids made him sweat. 

What had happened to him? 
What had Greer said? “Condi- 
tioned, aren’t you?” 



Crandal gathered himself to- 
gether and pushed himself out 
into the world once more. 

The Orphanage looked naked 
and ugly and smaller by day- 
light. And it was locked up tight. 
Crandal knocked on the door and 
listened to the echoes. 

“There’s no use hammering on 
me, you know,” said the doorbot 
angrily. “I’m only obeying orders 
and there’s nobody home. What’s 
more, I don’t know if anybody 
ever will be home. Nobody ever 
tells me anything.” 

Crandal gave up and went to 
the Courthouse. “My name is 
Boyd Crandal,” he said to the 
recorderbot. “A little more than 
a week ago, a complaint was 
registered against me. I want to 
see the record of the disposition 
made.” 

“S.O.E., sir,” said the recorder- 
bot. “First booth to the left.” 

Crandal sat in the booth and 
looked at himself through the 
stereoscopic lenses of the judge- 
jurorbot. He leaned close and 
stared into his own eyes. Mir- 
rored in them were the lenses 
and receiver-speaker of the judge. 
Why, Crandal thought in sur- 
prise, it’s nothing but an answer- 
bot! 

A fragment of nonsense verse 
came to him unbidden: 

I’ll be judge, 

I’ll be jury, 

Said cunning, old Fury. 



LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



25 



Crandal corrected himself. It 
was an answerbot, true. But its 
memory was the totality of law, 
statutory and common, and the 
welter of decision and precedent 
from which to draw a concensus. 
Whatever its verdict, an appeal 
was futile. 

'T'HE JUDICIARY system was 
prompt, efficient, impartial, 
and unified; the decision of this 
answerbot was the decision of 
society. 

“You have no sheisterbot?” the 
judge said. 

Crandal shrugged. “What’s the 
use? They’re only extensions of 
the court. No, I’ll plead my own 
case and then, at least, we won’t 
have a monologue.” 

“You are charged with operat- 
ing a sweatshop. How do you 
plead?” 

“Not guilty by definition,” 
Crandal said firmly. “An android 
is nothing but a glorified machine. 
It can’t feel. It doesn’t care. 
‘Overwork’ and ‘cruelty’ are 
meaningless adjectives — sheer 
legalistic nonsense — when ap- 
plied to androids.” 

“They are convenient fictions 
for economic necessity,” the judge 
said in a dry, legal voice. “Moral- 
ity and ethics are only different 
aspects of the common law. They 
help define what society can per- 
mit and still remain substantially 
unchanged.” 



“What difference does it make 
to society how hard I work my 
androids?” 

“Remember Kant’s categorical 
imperative: ‘Act only on such a 
maxim as you can will that it 
should become a universal law.’ 
If everyone worked his androids 
beyond established limits, society 
would be drowned in its own 
products. The working hours 
built into the androids must be 
accepted by everyone, or society 
as we know it could not exist. By 
working your androids overtime 
you became rich enough to buy 
additional androids which you 
then overworked to become even 
richer. It was a cumulative pro- 
cess whose inevitable end was 
your ownership of every android 
on Earth.” 

“Nuts!” said Crandal. 

“In addition, there is the fact 
that you evaded the natural limi- 
tations implicit in the android 
organism. This is a threat to so- 
ciety and criminal per se.” 

“Well,” Crandal said defiantly, 
“what are you going to do about 
it?” 

“You are found guilty as 
charged,” the judge-jurorbot said 
with machine coldness. “Your 
androids are confiscated, and you 
are sentenced to the Reformatory 
for conditioning against any repe- 
tition of this crime.” 

Crandal sat in the booth for a 
long moment after the record 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clicked off. The Reformatory. The 
word sent cold arrows into his 
guts. 

W HEN HE got back to the 
apartment, the android was 
deep in the chairbot, its hands 
folded across its lap Quaffless, 
since the last Quaff was gone. It 
was watching the Tilden-Perry- 
Budge-Kramer round-robin tour- 
nament. 

“Oh, no!” Crandal groaned. 
“That clothing business, that 
wasn’t my specialty either, Mas- 
ter,” the android said, not moving. 
“I’m sure it was all for the best, 
though.” 

“Tell me. Let me know the 
worst.” 

“I was wearing the clothes out 
too fast.” 

“Bill payable,” said the bank- 
erbot. “Five suits, six pairs of 
shoes, eleven pairs of socks, worn 
out, ruined, and otherwise rend- 
ered worthless by one MP(CT) 
android, serial 0013, owner: Boyd 
Crandal, seven hundred and 
eighty-three bills.” 

“How,” Crandal asked patient- 
ly, “could you wear out five suits, 
six pairs of shoes, and eleven 
pairs of socks in less than two 
hours?” 

“That,” the android said, “I 
seem to have a talent for.” 

Crandal passed a shaky hand 
across his face. “This is the end,” 
he said weakly. “I can’t stand it 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



any longer. I’ve got to get rid of 
you.” 

“I’m a poor little - — ■” 

“Orphan android. I know. It 
doesn’t matter. One of us has to 
go, and it isn’t going to be me.” 
“What are you going to do?” 
“Sell you.” 

“No one would buy me,” the 
android said wistfully. 

“Then I’ll give you away!” 
“Who would accept me?” 

“I’ll send you off somewhere!” 
Crandal shouted. “I’ll order you 
to leave and never come back.” 
“You would still be responsi- 
ble for my actions and bills.” 

“I’ll smash you into tiny 
pieces,” Crandal said in a danger- 
ous voice, “and shovel you down 
the disposerbot.” 

“Murder!” breathed the an- 
droid in an awed voice. 

And Crandal pounded his fore- 
head, feeling helpless. He had a 
devil riding on his back in the 
shape of an android, MP(CT), 
and he could never shake it loose. 
Damn Greer! he thought desper- 
ately. He saddled me with this 
thing, and he knew what he was 
doing. Otherwise, why did he dis- 
appear? 

“Stay here! Don’t go anywhere! 
Don’t do anything! Don’t — ” 
“I’m hungry, Master,” the an- 
droid broke in. 

“Eat, then!” Crandal wailed. 
“But don’t do anything else.” 

He ran into the hall, feeling,

“But not rich enough,” Herrera 
told him, his long brown face 
creasing into a brilliant grin. 

Stellman came up, puffing un- 
der the weight of his testing 
equipment. He set it carefully 
on the path and sat down. “You 
gentlemen interested in a short 
breather?” he asked. 

“Why not?” Herrera said. “All 
the time in the world.” He sat 
down with his back against a 
T-shaped formation of rock. 

S TELLMAN lighted a pipe 
and Herrera found a cigar 
in the zippered pocket of his cov- 
erall. Paxton watched them for 
a while. Then he asked, “Well, 
when are we getting off this 
planet? Or do we set up perma- 
nent residence?” 

Herrera just grinned and 
scratched a light for his cigar. 

“Well, how about it?” Paxton 
shouted. 

“Relax, you’re outvoted,” Stell- 
man said. “We formed this com- 
pany as three equal partners.” 
“All using my money,” Paxton 
said. 

“Of course. That’s why we took 
you in. Herrera had the practical 
mining experience. I had the theo- 
retical knowledge and a pilot’s 
license. You had the money.” 
“But we’ve got plenty of stuff 
on board now,” Paxton said. “The 
storage compartments are com- 
pletely filled. Why can’t we go 



to some civilized place now and 
start spending?” 

“Herrera and I don’t have 
your aristocratic attitude toward 
wealth,” Stellman said with exag- 
gerated patience. “Herrera and I 
have the childish desire to fill 
every nook and cranny with 
treasure. Gold nuggets in the fuel 
tanks, emeralds in the flour cans, 
diamonds a foot deep on deck. 
And this is just the place for it. 
All manner of costly baubles are 
lying around just begging to be 
picked up. We want to be dis- 
gustingly, abysmally rich, Pax- 
ton.” 

Paxton hadn’t been listening. 
He was staring intently at a point 
near the edge of the trail. In a 
low voice, he said, “That tree 
just moved.” 

Herrera burst into laughter. 
“Monsters, I suppose,” he sneered. 

“Be calm,” Stellman said 
mournfully. “My boy, I am a 
middle-aged man, overweight and 
easily frightened. Do you think 
I’d stay here if there were the 
slightest danger?” 

“There! It moved again!” 

“We surveyed this planet three 
months ago,” Stellman said. “We 
found no intelligent beings, no 
dangerous animals, no poisonous 
plants, remember? All we found 
were woods and mountains and 
gold and lakes and emeralds and 
rivers and diamonds. If there 
were something here, wouldn’t it

before it screeched open. Crandal 
leaped down the stairs, three at a 
time; leaped and turned, leaped 
and turned, until he was breath- 
less and tired and incapable of 
running another step. 

O N THE DOOR, faded num- 
bers said: 137. He had de- 
scended only thirteen floors. He 
stood there, panting, staring at 
the door. He would never reach 
the ground. A cold anger began 
to grow in his viscera. 

When it was big enough, he 
pushed through the door into the 
hall beyond. On either side of it 
were little, doorless, boxlike of- 
fices, an android in each of them 
with a desk, a chair, an answer- 
bot and nothing else. Androids 
walked briskly along the hall in 
dark, conservative suits, looking 
competent and authoritative. 

An Executive type, Crandal 
thought. He walked among them, 
and they seemed to ignore him. 
All the offices were occupied. 

At the end of the hall was a 
vast room two stories tall. In the 
center of it was a multitude of 
androids at desks. Each wall was 
a chart, constantly changing, jag- 
ged lines in a hundred different 
colors and shades, rising and fall- 
ing, making it a rainbow thing 
of beauty. 

Crandal stood in the doorway, 
stunned, wondering what it all 
meant. Recklessly, he stopped a 

30 



passing android. “What is all 
this?” he asked, awed in spite of 
himself. 

“Step out into the room a 
little,” said the android in a quick, 
decisive voice. “This wall depicts 
production. See how even and 
smooth the curves are? That’s 
efficiency. The other three walls 
represent consumption, each line 
a different product. See how they 
skip and jump and vary? Now, 
sir, if you will come with me, we 
will determine your status — ” 
“Remove your hands!” Cran- 
dal said icily. 

“Very well, sir. I must be get- 
ting on with my job.” 

He walked away, leaving Cran- 
dal sweating behind him. The 
news hadn’t reached here yet. He 
had a few minutes left. He re- 
treated back along the hall. He 
found an empty office. 

“What,” he said in a crisp, 
executive voice, “is an android 
model MP(CT)?” 

“A-MP(CT),” said the answer- 
bot. “Consumer-type multi-pur- 
pose android. Experimental model 
in its fifth and final year of tests. 
No price listed.” 

“Consumer!” Crandal ex- 
claimed. “What’s the use of that?” 
“To consume, of course.” 

The voice didn’t come from 
the answerbot. It came from the 
doorway. Standing there was a 
blue-clad policemandroid, smiling 
pleasantly. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



64‘WTELL, Boyd Crandal,” said 
the judge-jurorbot, “you 
are back again.” 

“So I understand,” said 
Crandal. 

“The charges are even more 
serious this time: attempted sui- 
cide, impersonating an android, 
receiving restricted information.” 
The judge gave the illusion of 
wagging his head. “How do you 
plead?” 

“Guilty.” 

“You realize the consequences? 
You throw yourself upon the 
mercy of the court?” 

“Don’t make me laugh! Get on 
with it.” 

“Very well. You are a recidiv- 
ist. You are sentenced to the 
Reformatory for conditioning 
against a repetition of this crime 
with the warning that next time 
you appear before me you will 
jae a three-time loser and subject 
to complete character reforma- 
tion.” 

“Wait a minute,” Crandal said 
frantically. “Aren’t you going to 
confiscate my androids?” 

“You have androids?” 

“One.” 

“Model?” 

“MP(CT),” Crandal said. 
“That model is not subject to 
confiscation. Next case!” 

The policemandroid took Cran- 
dal by the arm and led him down 
the long, gray hall to the 
door marked REFORMATORY. 



Crandal went dazedly, muttering 
to himself. 

They went through the door- 
way and the door clicked solidly, 
finally, behind them. Crandal 
roused a little. Here he was again. 
Something stirred in his memory. 
Was he going to regain the past 
only to lose it again? 

The policemandroid opened a 
door in the gray hall. “In here.” 

Beyond was a small room 
equipped with a couch, a chair, 
and hypnagogic equipment. Mem- 
ory was returning in a flood. 
Crandal recognized the lights that 
spun in front of his eyes and the 
colors that flickered meaningful- 
ly, and he remembered a voice 
that murmured . 

“Wait here for the psychoan- 
droid,” said the policemandroid, 
and withdrew. The door clicked. 

Crandal looked at it. There 
was no doorknob on this side. 
Where could he go? 

He sat down on the couch and 
rubbed his aching forehead wear- 
ily. Had it been only twenty-four 
hours since the porterbot had 
brought him the box with all the 
troubles in it? 

The door opened. Crandal 
stared in shocked disbelief. It was 
Lucy Shannon, looking extremely 
feminine in a white uniform. 

4 4 A/" OU!” Crandal said, horri- 
fled. “A psychoandroid!” 

Lucy shook her head, smiling. 



LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



31 



“Just a psychiatrist.” 

“I don’t believe you! Take off 
your clothes!” 

Lucy’s smile broadened. “It’s 
a little soon for that, isn’t it? And 
hardly the place. And if I should 
— I can’t guarantee that I will, 
of course — you’ll have to ask 
me nicer.” 

Crandal stared at her fiercely. 
“Then what are you?” 

“I told you — a psychiatrist 
and a woman — competing with 
robots and androids.” 

“How?” 

“I have an advantage over 
them. I have a talent they don’t 
have.” 

“What?” 

Lucy looked at him soberly. 
“I’ll tell you the same way you 
once told me. Robots are logical; 
people are crazy. Robots can do 
what is built into them and no 
more. The capabilities of the hu- 
man animal have never been 
plumbed. Robots are conditioned 
against the impossible; people are 
dreamers. Robots can add two 
and two to get four, but it takes 
a person to add two and two to 
get five, to get the right answer 
for all the wrong reasons, in spite 
of logic — ” 

“I knew you before,” Crandal 
said wonderingly. 

“Yes.” 

“That part doesn’t come back,” 
Crandal said in confusion. “That 
doesn’t come back at all!” 

32 



“I hope it doesn’t,” Lucy said. 
“You weren’t a very nice person. 
Valuable, but not very nice. I 
like you better like this.” 

“Now what are you trying to 
do?” 

“To save your recent memory 
from being wiped away a second 
time.” 

“Why?” 

“Because we need you. We 
need every man who can fight 
free of his womb-room and do 
something for himself, but we 
need you in particular because 
you have more of the two-plus- 
two-equals-five quality than any 
of us. How do you think you got 
those ten androids of yours to 
work twenty-three hours a day? 
You rewired them and developed 
a new powerpack more than five 
times as efficient.” 

“I did?” 

“You did. You don’t remember 
now, but you will. The top com- 
mandroids have it now and we 
need it. Last time I got to you 
too late for anything but the 
delay of execution of the post- 
hypnotic suggestion. This time 
you’ll resist it completely.” 

“I still don’t understand what 
this is all about!” 

L UCY GLANCED impatiently 
at the door. “As more and 
more of the jobs were taken over 
by the mechanicals, fewer people 
were left to give orders and have 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



them obeyed. Now there’s noth- 
ing but androids at the top and 
they’re running things much too 
logically.” 

“What can anybody do about 
it?” 

“We can work our way back 
into positions of authority, back 
into positions where we can give 
the orders again.” 

“What can I do?” Crandal 
asked helplessly. 

Lucy studied him with green, 
interested eyes. “You can go to 
night school like the rest of us. 
You’ll learn fast: reading, writ- 
ing and whatever technical in- 
formation you need. We have 
some fantastic pedagogical de- 
vices. But during the day you’ll 
work.” 

“At what?” 

Lucy shrugged. “At whatever 
your two - plus - two - equals - five 
mind can do best. Maybe you 
can invent things for IBM or 
Remington-Rand. But you’ll work 
your way up.” 

She glanced at the door again. 
This time it opened, and Crandal 
tensed. 

“Okay,” said the pudgy, blond 
man, wiping his sweating fore- 
head, “you’ve got forty minutes. 
I don’t like this — ” 

“Greer!” Crandal shouted. 
“You’re the one who sold me 
that consumer-type android! You 
did it on purpose!” He turned 
on Lucy. “And you delayed my 



conditioning so I’d have time to 
buy the damned thing before 
amnesia set in!” 

“That’s not precisely true,” 
Lucy said defensively. “We only 
gave you the opportunity. You 
bought it for your own larcenous 
purposes. We would have had to 
work out something else, though, 
if that had fallen through. We 
had to stir you out of your happy 
nest, somehow.” 

Crandal appealed to Lucy. 
“Can’t something be done? 
You’ve got to take it back! Or 
can’t I be deconditioned so that 
I can smash it up or something?” 
Lucy shook her head sadly. “If 
I could do that, I’d do it for my-

self. Why. do you think I got out 
and worked?” 

“You, too?” Crandal said faint- 
ly- 

“We’ll have to learn to live 
with them.” 

Crandal groaned. “Why a con- 
sumer-type android?” 

G REER spread his hands as if 
the answer were obvious. “To 
consume.” 

“But why consumers?” Cran- 
dal asked. “People consume.” 
“It’s the Prime Directive.” 
Greer wiped his forehead. “Twen- 
ty-six minutes left.” 

“What do you mean, the Prime 
Directive?” Crandal snapped irri- 
tably. 

“S.O.E. Service. Obedience. Ef- 
ficiency. They’re the guiding prin- 
ciples of every robot, every an- 
droid. Built into them; must be

down; they can’t plan production 
because we’re not predictable.” 
“But they’ll replace people,” 
Crandal gasped. “They’re com- 
peting as consumers.” 

“And you can’t compete with 
robots and androids,” Lucy said. 
“You told me that yourself. 
That’s why we have to get back 
on top. Now lie down. I’ve got 
to give you some post-hypnotic 
suggestions and there isn’t much 
time.” 

Crandal lay back, and the light 
began to spin in front of his eyes. 
“Lucy!” he moaned, reaching out 
toward her blindly. 

Her hand was cool and firm in 
his. “There, now,” she said in a 
soft voice. “There’ll be time 
enough later for everything.” 

He stared at the light. What 
had she meant by “everything”? 

He remembered, just before he 
went under, that he would have 
to go home eventually. Home was 
where the android was. It waited 
there for him — with folded 
hands.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Hunting Problem 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



A world that forgets its past 
is a world without a future — 
but it shouldn't go this far! 



I T WAS the last troop meeting 
before the big Scouter Jam- 
boree, and all the patrols had 
turned out. Patrol 22 — the Soar- 
ing Falcon Patrol — was camped 
in a shady hollow, holding a ten- 
tacle pull. The Brave Bison Pa- 
trol, number 31, was moving 
around a little stream. The Bisons 
were practicing their skill at 
drinking liquids, and laughing 
excitedly at the odd sensation. 

And the Charging Mirash Pa- 
trol, number 19, was waiting for 



Scouter Drog, who was late as 
usual. 

Drog hurtled down from the 
ten-thousand-foot level, went 
solid, and hastily crawled into 
the circle of scouters. “Gee,” he 
said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t realize 
what time — ” 

The Patrol Leader glared at 
him. “You’re out of uniform, 
Drog.” 

“Sorry, sir,” Drog said, hastily 
extruding a tentacle he had for- 
gotten.

The others giggled. Drog 
blushed a dim orange. He wished 
he were invisible. 

But it wouldn’t be proper right 
now. 

“I will open our meeting with 
the Scouter Creed,” the Patrol 
Leader said. He cleared his 
throat. “We, the Young Scouters 
of planet Elbonai, pledge to per- 
petuate the skills and virtues of 
our pioneering ancestors. For 
that purpose, we Scouters adopt 
the shape our forebears were 
born to when they conquered the 
virgin wilderness of Elbonai. We 
hereby resolve — ” 

Scouter Drog adjusted his 
hearing receptors to amplify the 
Leader’s soft voice. The Creed 
always thrilled him. It was hard 
•to believe that his ancestors had 
once been earthbound. Today the 
Elbonai were aerial beings, main- 
taining only the minimum of 
body, fueling by cosmic radiation 
at the twenty-thousand-foot level, 
sensing by direct perception, com- 
ing down only for sentimental or 
sacramental purposes. They had 
come a long way since the Age 
of Pioneering. The modern world 
had begun with the Age of Sub- 
molecular Control, which was 
followed by the present age of 
Direct Control. 

“. honesty and fair play,” the 
Leader was saying. “And we 
further resolve to drink liquids, 
as they did, and to eat solid food, 

36 



and to increase our skill in their 
tools and methods.” 

T HE invocation completed, the 
youngsters scattered around 
the plain. The Patrol Leader 
came up to Drog. 

“This is the last meeting before 
the Jamboree,” the Leader said. 
“I know,” Drog said. 

“And you are the only second- 
class scouter in the Charging 
Mirash Patrol. All the others are 
first class, or at least Junior Pio- 
neers. What will people think 
about our patrol?” 

Drog squirmed uncomfortably. 
“It isn’t entirely my fault,” he 
said. “I know I failed the tests in 
swimming and bomb making, but 
those just aren’t my skills. It 
isn’t fair to expect me to know 
everything. Even among the pio- 
neers there were specialists. No 
one was expected to know all — ” 
“And just what are your 
skills?” the Leader interrupted. 

“Forest and Mountain Lore,” 
Drog answered eagerly. “Track- 
ing and hunting.” 

The Leader studied him for a 
moment. Then he said slowly, 
“Drog, how would you like one 
last chance to make first class, 
and win an achievement badge 
as well?” 

“I’d do anything!” Drog cried. 
“Very well,” the Patrol Leader 
said. “What is the name of our 
patrol?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




HUNTING PROBLEM 



37 



“The Charging Mirash Patrol.” 
“And what is a Mirash?” 

“A large and ferocious animal,” 
Drog answered prqmptly. “Once 
they inhabited large parts of El- 
bonai, and our ancestors fought 
many savage battles with them. 
Now they are extinct.” 

“Not quite,” the Leader said. 
“A scouter was exploring the 
woods five hundred miles north 
of here, coordinates S-233 by 
482-W, and he came upon a pride 
of three Mirash, all bulls, and 
therefore huntable. I want you, 
Drog, to track them down, to 
stalk them, using Forest and 
Mountain Lore. Then, utilizing 
only pioneering tools and meth- 
ods, I want you to bring back the 
pelt of one Mirash. Do you think 
you can do it?” 

“I know I can, sir!” 

“Go at once,” the Leader said. 
“We will fasten the pelt to our 
flagstaff. We will undoubtedly be 
commended at the Jamboree.” 
“Yes, sir!” Drog hastily gath- 
ered up his equipment, filled his 
canteen with liquid, packed a 
lunch of solid food, and set out. 

A FEW minutes later, he had 
levitated himself to the gen- 
eral area of S-233 by 482-W. It 
was a wild and romantic country 
of jagged rocks and scrubby trees, 
thick underbrush in the valleys, 
snow on the peaks. Drog looked 
around, somewhat troubled. 



He had told the Patrol Leader 
a slight untruth. 

The fact of the matter was, he 
wasn’t particularly skilled in For- 
est and Mountain Lore, hunting 
or tracking. He wasn’t particu- 
larly skilled in anything except 
dreaming away long hours among 
the clouds at the five-thousand- 
foot level. What if he failed to 
find a Mirash? What if the 
Mirash found him first? 

But that couldn’t happen, he 
assured himself. In a pinch, he 
could always gestibulize. Who 
would ever know? 

In another moment he picked 
up a faint trace of Mirash scent. 
And then he saw a slight move- 
ment about twenty yards away, 
near a curious T-shaped forma- 
tion of rock. 

Was it really going to be this 
easy? How nice! Quietly he 
adopted an appropriate camou- 
flage and edged forward. 

T HE mountain trail became 
steeper, and the sun beat 
harshly down. Paxton was sweat- 
ing, even in his air-conditioned 
coverall. And he was heartily 
sick of being a good sport. 

“Just when are we leaving this 
place?” he asked. 

Herrera slapped him genially 
on the shoulder. “Don’t you 
wanna get rich?” 

“We’re rich already,” Paxton 
said.

as the door closed behind him, as 
if he’d escaped from hell. It was 
only for a moment. 

r I '’HE STREET was a moving, 
■*- bustling, inhuman kind of 
hell through which he ran, dodg- 
ing and turning, trying to escape 
from a hopelessness that followed 
him relentlessly, deepening all 
the while. 

When he stopped for breath, 
he was in front of the towering 
Remington-Randroid building, 
S.O.E. printed tall and proud 
across its fagade, Crandal craned 
his neck back and stared up. Up 
was a long way, 150 stories, sky- 
tall. 

The lobby was busy with an- 
droids coming and going on their 
eternal errands, but Crandal 
passed among them unnoticed 
and slipped into an elevatorbot. 
“The roof!” he said. 

When he walked out upon the 
flat skyscraper roof, the wind was 
fierce and frigid around him, tug- 
ging with icy fingers at his hair 
and clothes. Crandal pulled his 
jacket tight around his chest, 
walked to the shoulder-high bar- 
rier, and looked out over the 
city. The streets were flowing 
rivers of mindless traffic between 
the stone and metal canyons. 

As far as he could see, the 
city stretched out, sterile and in- 
human. Nowhere was there flesh 
and blood but here, alone, upon 

LITTLE ORPHAN ANDROID 



this sterile concrete summit. 

He leaned over the barrier and 
stared down dizzily. What was 
the use of going on? His home 
was no longer a sacred fortress; 
it was a place of torment from 
which he escaped. He had no 
money and no hopes of ever get- 
ting any. Ahead of him there 
was nothing but frustration and 
deprivation. 

He raised himself up and 
leaned farther. 

The barrierbot caught him by 
the arm. “Suicide is against the 
law,” it said in a stern, moral 
voice. 

“Let me go!” 

“You will wait quietly, please, 
until the policemandroids arrive.” 

“I said, ‘Let me go!’” Crandal 
repeated. 

“I am sorry, sir, but I cannot 
obey. You will wait quietly, 
please — ” 

Crandal twisted away, leaving 
his jacket in the barrierbot’s 
metal and rubberoid fingers. He 
ran swiftly to the elevatorbot. 
“Down!” he shouted. 

“An alarm has been sounded,” 
the elevatorbot said mechani- 
cally. “I cannot leave this floor 
until the police arrive.” 

Crandal jumped out of the car 
and stared around frantically at 
the bare roof-top. The whole 
world had turned against him. 

Then he saw the door. He ran 
toward it. For a moment it stuck

have attacked us long before?” 

“I’m telling you I saw it move,” 
Paxton insisted. 

Herrera stood up. “This tree?” 
he asked Paxton. 

“Yes. See, it doesn’t even look 
like the others. Different tex- 
ture — ” 

In a single synchronized move- 
ment, Herrera pulled a Mark II 
blaster from a side holster and 
fired three charges into the tree. 
The tree and all underbrush for 
ten yards around burst into flame 
and crumpled. 

“All gone now,” Herrera said. 

Paxton rubbed his jaw. “I 
heard it scream when you shot 
it.” 

“Sure. But it’s dead now,” 
Herrera said soothingly. “If any- 
thing else moves, you just tell 
me, I shoot it. Now we find some 
more little emeralds, huh?” 

Paxton and Stellman lifted 
their packs and followed Herrera 
up the trail. Stellman said in a 
low, amused voice, “Direct sort 
of fellow, isn’t he?” 

S LOWLY Drog returned to 
consciousness. The Mirash’s 
flaming weapon had caught him 
in camouflage, almost completely 
unshielded. He still couldn’t un- 
derstand how it had happened. 
There had been no premonitory 
fear-scent, no snorting, no snarl- 
ing, no warning whatsoever. The 
Mirash had attacked with blind 

40 



suddenness, without waiting to 
see if he were friend or foe. 

At last Drog understood the 
nature of the beast he was up 
against. 

He waited until the hoofbeats 
of the three bull Mirash had fad- 
ed into the distance. Then, pain- 
fully, he tried to extrude a visual 
receptor. Nothing happened. He 
had a moment of utter panic. If 
his central nervous system was 
damaged, this was the end. 

He tried again. This time, a 
piece of rock slid off him, and he 
was able to reconstruct. 

Quickly he performed an in- 
ternal scansion. He sighed with 
relief. It had been a close thing. 
Instinctively he had quondicated 
at the flash moment and it had 
saved his life. 

He tried to think of another 
course of action, but the shock of 
that sudden, vicious, unpremedi- 
tated assault had driven all Hunt- 
ing Lore out of his mind. He 
found that he had absolutely no 
desire to encounter the savage 
Mirash again. 

Suppose he returned without 
the stupid hide? He could tell 
the Patrol Leader that the Mirash 
were all females, and therefore 
unhuntable. A Young Scouter’s 
word was honored, so no one 
would question him, or even 
check up. 

But that would never do. How 
could he even consider it? 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Well, he told himself gloomily, 
he could resign from the Scouters, 
put an end to the whole ridicu- 
lous business; the campfires, the 
singing, the games, the comrade- 
ship . 

This would never do, Drog de- 
cided, taking himself firmly in 
hand. He was acting as though 
the Mirash were antagonists cap- 
able of planning against him. But 
the Mirash were not even intelli- 
gent beings. No creature without 
tentacles had ever developed true 
intelligence. That was Etlib’s 
Law, and it had never been dis- 
puted. 

In a battle between intelli- 
gence and instinctive cunning, in- 
telligence always won. It had to. 
All he had to do was figure out 
how. 

Drog began to track the 
Mirash again, following their 
odor. What colonial weapon 
should he use? A small atomic 
bomb? No, that would more than 
likely ruin the hide. 

He stopped suddenly and 
laughed. It was really very sim- 
ple, when one applied oneself. 
Why should he come into direct 
and dangerous contact with the 
Mirash? The time had come to 
use his brain, his understanding 
of animal psychology, his knowl- 
edge of Lures and Snares. 

Instead of tracking the Mirash, 
he would go to their den. 

And there he would set a trap. 



T HEIR temporary camp was 
in a cave, and by the time 
they arrived there it was sunset. 
Every crag and pinnacle of rock 
threw a precise and sharp-edged 
shadow. The ship lay five miles 
below them on the valley floor, its 
metallic hide glistening red and 
silver. In their packs were a dozen 
emeralds, small, but of an excel- 
lent color. 

At an hour like this, Paxton 
thought of a small Ohio town, a 
soda fountain, a girl with bright 
hair. Herrera smiled to himself, 
contemplating certain gaudy 
ways of spending a million dollars 
before settling down to the seri- 
ous business of ranching. And 
Stellman was already phrasing 
his Ph.D. thesis on extraterrestrial 
mineral deposits. 

They were all in a pleasant, 
relaxed mood. Paxton had recov- 
ered completely from his earlier 
attack of nerves. Now he wished 
an alien monster would show up 
— a green one, by preference — 
chasing a lovely, scantily clad 
woman. 

“Home again,” Stellman said 
as they approached the entrance 
of the cave. “Want beef stew to- 
night?” It was his turn to cook. 

“With onions,” Paxton said, 
starting into the cave. He jumped 
back abruptly. “What’s that?” 

A few feet from the mouth of 
the cave was a small roast beef, 
still steaming hot, four large dia- 



HUNTING PROBLEM 



41 



monds, and a bottle of whiskey. 

“That’s odd,” Stellman said. 
“And a trifle unnerving.” 

Paxton bent down to examine 
a diamond. Herrera pulled him 
back. 

“Might be booby-trapped.” 

“There aren’t any wires,” Pax- 
ton said. 

Herrera stared at the roast 
beef, the diamonds, the bottle of 
whiskey. He looked very un- 
happy. 

“I don’t trust this,” he said. 

“Maybe there are natives here,” 
Stellman said. “Very timid ones. 
This might be their goodwill 
offering.” 

“Sure,” Herrera said. “They 
sent to Terra for a bottle of Old 
Space Ranger just for us.” 

“What are we going to do?” 
Paxton asked. 

“Stand clear,” Herrera said. 
“Move ’way back.” He broke off 
a long branch from a nearby tree 
and poked gingerly at the dia- 
monds. 

“Nothing’s happening,” Paxton 
said. 

The long grass Herrera was 
standing on whipped tightly 
around his ankles. The ground 
beneath him surged, broke into 
a neat disc fifteen feet in diameter 
and, trailing root-ends, began to 
lift itself into the air. Herrera 
tried to jump free, but the grass 
held him like a thousand green 
tentacles. 

42 



“Hang on!” Paxton yelled idi- 
otically, rushed forward and 
grabbed a corner of the rising 
disc of earth. It dipped steeply, 
stopped for a moment, and began 
to rise again. By then Herrera 
had his knife out, and was slash- 
ing the grass around his ankles. 
Stellman came unfrozen when he 
saw Paxton rising past his head. 

Stellman seized him by the 
ankles, arresting the flight of the 
disc once more. Herrera wrenched 
one foot free and threw himself 
over the edge. The other ankle 
was held for a moment, then the 
tough grass parted under his 
weight. He dropped head-first to 
the ground, at the last moment 
ducking his head and landing on 
his shoulders. Paxton let go of 
the disc and fell, landing on Stell- 
man’s stomach. 

The disc of earth, with its cargo 
of roast beef, whiskey and dia- 
monds, continued to rise until it 
was out of sight. 

The sun had set. Without 
speaking, the three men entered 
their cave, blasters drawn. They 
built a roaring fire at the mouth 
and moved back into the cave’s 
interior. 

“We’ll guard in shifts tonight,” 
Herrera said. 

Paxton and Stellman nodded. 

Herrera said, “I think you’re 
right, Paxton. We’ve stayed here 
long enough.” 

“Too long,” Paxton said. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Herrera shrugged his shoulders. 
“As soon as it’s light, we return 
to the ship and get out of here.” 
“If,” Stellman said, “we are able 
to reach the ship.” 

D ROG was quite discouraged. 

With a sinking heart he had 
watched the premature springing 
of his trap, the struggle, and the 
escape of the Mirash. It had been 
such a splendid Mirash, too. The 
biggest of the three! 

He knew now what he had 
done wrong. In his eagerness, he 
had overbaited his trap. Just the 
minerals would have been suffi- 
cient, for Mirash were notoriously 
mineral-tropic. But no, he had to 
improve on pioneer methods, he 
had to use food stimuli as well. 
No wonder they had reacted sus- 
piciously, with their senses so 
overburdened. 

Now they were enraged, alert, 
and decidedly dangerous. 

And a thoroughly aroused 
Mirash was one of the most fear- 
some sights in the Galaxy. 

Drog felt very much alone as 
Elbonai’s twin moons rose in 
the western sky. He could see the 
Mirash campfire blazing in the 
mouth of their cave. And by di- 
rect perception he could see the 
Mirash crouched within, every 
sense alert, weapons ready. 

Was a Mirash hide really 
worth all this trouble? 

Drog decided that he would 



much rather be floating at the 
five-thousand-foot level, sculptur- 
ing cloud formations and dream- 
ing. He wanted to sop up radia- 
tion instead of eating nasty old 
solid food. And what use was all 
this hunting and trapping, any- 
how? Worthless skills that his 
people had outgrown. 

For a moment he almost had 
himself convinced. And then, in 
a flash of pure perception, he 
understood what it was all about. 

True, the Elbonaians had out- 
grown their competition, devel- 
oped past all danger of competi- 
tion. But the Universe was wide, 
and capable of many surprises. 
Who could foresee what would 
come, what new dangers the race 
might have to face? And how 
could they meet them if the hunt- 
ing instinct was lost? 

No, the old ways had to be 
preserved, to serve as patterns; 
as reminders that peaceable, in- 
telligent life was an unstable 
entity in an unfriendly Universe. 

He was going to get that 
Mirash hide, or die trying! 

The most important thing was 
to get them out of that cave. Now 
his hunting knowledge had re- 
turned to him. 

Quickly, skillfully, he shaped 
a Mirash horn. 

44T'kID YOU hear that?” Pax- 
'Ll ton asked. 

“I thought I heard something,” 



HUNTING PROBLEM 



43 



Stellman said, and they all lis- 
tened intently. 

The sound came again. It was 
voice crying, “Oh, help, help me!” 

“It’s a girl!” Paxton jumped to 
his feet. 

“It sounds like a girl,” Stellman 
said. 

“Please, help me,” the girl’s 
voice wailed. “I can’t hold out 
much longer. Is there anyone who 
can help me?” 

Blood rushed to Paxton’s face. 
In a flash he saw her, small, ex- 
quisite, standing beside her 
wrecked sports-spacer (what a 
fool-hardy trip it had been!) with 
monsters, green and slimy, closing 
in on her. And then he arrived, a 
foul alien beast. 

Paxton picked up a spare 
blaster. “I’m going out there,” he 
said coolly. 

“Sit down, you moron!” Her- 
rera ordered. 

“But you heard her, didn’t 
you?” 

“That can’t be a girl,” Herrera 
said. “What would a girl be doing 
on this planet?” 

“I’m going to find out,” Paxton 
said, brandishing two blasters. 
“Maybe a spaceliner crashed, or 
she could have been out joyrid- 
ing, and — ” 

“Siddown!” Herrera yelled. 

“He’s right,” Stellman tried to 
reason with Paxton. “Even if a 
girl is out there, which I doubt, 
there’s nothing we can do.” 

44 



“Oh, help, help, it’s coming 
after me!” the girl’s voice 
screamed. 

“Get out of my way,” Paxton 
said, his voice low and dangerous. 

“You’re really going?” Herrera 
asked incredulously. 

“Yes! Are you going to stop 
me?” 

“Go ahead.” Herrera gestured 
at the entrance of the cave. 

“We can’t let him!” Stellman 
gasped. 

“Why not? His funeral,” Her- 
rera said lazily. 

“Don’t worry about me,” Pax- 
ton said. “I’ll be back in fifteen 
minutes — with her!” He turned 
on his heel and started toward 
the entrance. Herrera leaned for- 
ward and, with considerable pre- 
cision, clubbed Paxton behind the 
ear with a stick of firewood. Stell- 
man caught him as he fell. 

They stretched Paxton out in 
the rear of the cave and returned 
to their vigil. The lady in distress 
moaned and pleaded for the next 
five hours. Much too long, as Pax- 
ton had to agree, even for a 
movie serial. 

A GLOOMY, rain-splattered 
daybreak found Drog still 
camped a hundred yards from 
the cave. He saw the Mirash 
emerge in a tight group, weapons 
ready, eyes watching warily for 
any movement. 

Why had the Mirash horn 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



failed? The Scouter Manual said 
it was an infallible means of at- 
tracting the bull Mirash. But per- 
haps this wasn’t mating season. 

They were moving in the direc- 
tion of a metallic ovoid which 
Drog recognized as a primitive 
spatial conveyance. It was crude, 
but once inside it the Mirash 
were safe from him. 

He could simply trevest them, 
and that would end it. But it 
wouldn’t be very humane. Above 
all, the ancient Elbonaians had 
been gentle and merciful, and a 
Young Scouter tried to be like 
them. Besides, trevestment wasn’t 
a true pioneering method. 

That left ilitrocy. It was the 
oldest trick in the book, and he’d 
have to get close to work it. But 
he had nothing to lose. 

And luckily, climatic condi- 
tions were perfect for it. 

T STARTED as a thin ground- 
mist. But, as the watery sun 
climbed the gray sky, fog began 
forming. 

Herrera cursed angrily as it 
grew more dense. “Keep close to- 
gether now. Of all the luck!” 

Soon they were walking with 
their hands on each others’ shoul- 
ders, blasters ready, peering into 
the impenetrable fog. 

“Herrera?” 

“Yeah?” 

“Are you sure we’re going in 
the right direction?” 



“Sure. I took a compass course 
before the fog closed in.” 

“Suppose your compass is off?” 
“Don’t even think about it.” 
They walked on, picking their 
way carefully over the rock- 
strewn ground. 

“I think I see the ship,” Paxton 
said. 

“No, not yet,” Herrera said. 
Stellman stumbled oyer a rock, 
dropped his blaster, picked it up 
again and fumbled around for 
Herrera’s shoulder. He found it 
and walked on. 

“I think we’re almost there,” 
Herrera said. 

“I sure hope so,” Paxton said. 
“I’ve had enough.” 

“Think your girl friend’s wait- 
ing for you at the ship?” 

“Don’t rub it in.” 

“Okay,” Herrera said. “Hey, 
Stellman, you better grab hold of 
my shoulder again. No sense get- 
ting separated.” 

“I am holding your shoulder,” 
Stellman said. 

“You’re not.” 

“I am, I tell you!” 

“Look, I guess I know if some- 
one’s holding my shoulder or not.” 
“Am I holding your shoulder, 
Paxton?” 

“No,” Paxton said. 

“That’s bad,” Stellman said, 
very slowly. “That’s bad, indeed.” 
“Why?” 

“Because I’m definitely holding 
someone’s shoulder.” 



HUNTING PROBLEM

Herrera yelled, “Get down, get 
down quick, give me room to 
shoot!” But it was too late. A 
sweet-sour odor was in the air. 
Stellman and Paxton smelled it 
and collapsed. Herrera ran for- 
ward blindly, trying to hold his 
breath. He stumbled and fell over 
a rock, tried to get back on his 
feet — 

And everything went black. 

The fog lifted suddenly and 
Drog was standing alone, smiling 
triumphantly. He pulled out a 
long-bladed skinning knife and 
bent over the nearest Mirash. 

T HE spaceship hurtled toward 
Terra at a velocity which 
threatened momentarily to burn 
out the overdrive. Herrera, 

hunched over the controls, finally 
regained his self-control and cut 
the speed down to normal. His 
usually tan face was still ashen, 
and his hands shook on the in- 
struments. 

Stellman came in from the 

bunkroom and flopped wearily in 
the co-pilot’s seat. 

“How’s Paxton?” Herrera 

asked. 

“I dosed him with Drona-3,” 
Stellman said. “He’s going to be 
all right.” 

“He’s a good kid,” Herrera 

said. 



“It’s just shock, for the most 
part,” Stellman said. “When he 
comes to, I’m going to put him 
to work counting diamonds. 
Counting diamonds is the best of 
therapies, I understand.” 

Herrera grinned, and his face 
began to regain its normal color. 
“I feel like doing a little diamond- 
counting myself, now that it’s all 
turned out okay.” Then his long 
face became serious. “But I ask 
you, Stellman, who could figure 
it? I still don’t understand!” 

T HE Scouter Jamboree was a 
glorious spectacle. The Soar- 
ing Falcon Patrol, number 22, 
gave a short pantomime showing 
the clearing of the land on El- 
bonai. The Brave Bisons, number 
31, were in full pioneer dress. 

And at the head of Patrol 19, 
the Charging Mirash Patrol, was 
Drog, a first-class Scouter now, 
wearing a glittering achievement 
badge. He was- carrying the Pa- 
trol flag — the position of honor 
— and everyone cheered to see 
it. 

Because waving proudly from 
the flagpole was the firm, fine- 
textured, characteristic skin of an 
adult Mirash, its zippers, tubes, 
gauges, buttons and holsters flash- 
ing merrily in the sunshine.

UNVEILING THE 
MYSTERY PLANET 

N AME THE planet which 
most closely resembles 
Earth in size. The an- 
swer, of course, is Venus. From 
direct measurements, its diameter 
works out to 7700 miles, while 
that of Earth is 7900 miles. But 
note, please, that these 7700 
miles include the cloud layer or 
layers of Venus, so the planet 
proper must be somewhat small- 
er. And don’t ask by how much 
— it isn’t very polite to ask 
questions to which the answer is 
not known.

Now name the planet that 
comes closest to Earth of all full- 
fledged planets — which means 
discounting a few planetoids like 
Hermes, Albert, Icarus, etc., and 
naturally our own moon, too. The 
answer is again Venus. When 
both Earth and Venus are on the 
same side of their orbits, the dis- 
tance between them amounts to 
about 26 million miles, which is 
a good 9 million miles closer 
than our neighbor on the other 
side, Mars, can ever manage. And 
even this is not the best Venus 
can do. On December 6, 1882, 
during a so-called transit — the 
transits will be discussed later — 
the distance was only 24,600,000 
miles. 

Now name the planet with the 
most nearly circular orbit. Venus, 
of course. Now the one which is 
the most nearly perfect sphere. 
Again Venus. And now name the 
planet about which least is 
known. The answer, disappoint- 
ingly, is still Venus. 

r I THOUGH Venus can come 
closer than any other planet, 
we know as little about it as we 
know about Pluto, the planet 
which is farthest away. In fact, 
what we do know well (and re- 
liably) is the same in both cases. 
We know their orbits. 

That of Venus, as has been 
said, is very nearly circular. The 
differences in the distance of the 

48 



closest approach between Venus 
and Earth are mostly caused by 
the fact that the orbit of Earth 
is somewhat eccentric; Earth is 
closest to the Sun in January. As 
for Venus, the average distance 
from the Sun is 67,200,000 miles, 
and the planet, moving with an 
average orbital velocity of 21.7 
miles per second — that of Earth 
is 18.5 miles per second — needs 
224.7 days to go around the Sun 
once. 

If the plane of the orbit of 
Venus coincided with that of 
Earth, which is the ecliptic, we 
would see the planet moving 
across the disk of the Sun every 
time Venus comes closest to us, 
overtaking the slower Earth in 
the permanent race around the 
Sun. But the plane of the orbit 
of Venus does not coincide with 
the plane of the orbit of Earth. 
There is a considerable tilt, 
amounting to 3 degrees, 23 min- 
utes and 38 seconds of arc. 

This is a stronger tilt than that 
of any other major planet, except- 
ing only Mercury (with 7° 0’ 
12”) and Pluto (with 17° 8’ 38”). 
Because of it, Venus, as a rule, 
does not pass between us and the 
Sun, but is, as seen from Earth, 
“above” or “below” the Sun. Only 
rarely does it happen that the 
two planets pass each other in 
sections of their orbit which are 
situated in such a manner that a 
line from the center of the Sun 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



through the centers of both plan- 
ets would be a straight line, or 
very nearly so. 

When that happens, we get a 
“transit.” Venus, which mostly is 
the brightest planet in the sky, 
then moves across the Sun’s disk 
as a black spot. The spacing of 
these transits in time is such that 
a man might either observe two 
of them within his lifetime or not 
live long enough to see even one. 
The generation born early in the 
present century will not live to 
see one, while the generation now 
being born will see two. 

It works like this: supposing a 
Venus transit is due in the year 
X, the next transit will take place 
in X + 8. But the next one after 
that will not happen until 1 2 1 V 2 
years later. Then there is again 
an interval of only 8 years, but if 
somebody just happened to miss 
them, he would have to wait for 
105 V 2 years for his next oppor- 
tunity. The cycle, then, runs 8, 
121V2, 8, 105y 2 , 8, 12154 and so 
forth. 

Actual years of Venus transits 
were 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882, 
with the next two scheduled for 
2004 and 2012. 

T> Y 2004, a Venus transit will 
-*-* assuredly have lost most of 
* its former importance, but in the 
past a transit was something that 
every astronomer was eager to 
observe — expeditions were sent 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



halfway around the globe in 
order to obtain observations from 
as many points as possible. The 
main reason was what had first 
been pointed out by the Astrono- 
mer Royal Dr. Edmond Halley; 
namely, that the precise time re- 
quired by Venus to cross the 
Sun’s disk could be used to cal- 
culate the distance from the 
Earth to the Sun, something that 
was not yet established then. 

In the course of these transit 
observations, it was found that 
Venus has an atmosphere. While 
Venus is crossing the Sun’s disk, 
it appears simply as a round 
black spot, but while entering 
and leaving, the round dark spot 
is surrounded by a luminous ring, 
caused by the bending of the 
Sun’s rays by the atmosphere. 

It is one of the “believe-it-or- 
nots” of the history of science 
that the first two reports on this 
phenomenon were casually for- 
gotten. 

The first to see it and to draw 
the proper conclusions (and to 
write them up, which is import- 
ant, too) was Mikhail Vasilye- 
vitch Lomonosov, who observed 
it from his home in St. Peters- 
burg, Russia, during the transit 
of May 26, 1761. Though his dis- 
covery was discussed with much 
animation at the Imperial Acad- 
emy of Science, nobody outside 
Russia learned about this fact 
until another Russian scientist 

49 



published a book about Lomono- 
sov in Germany in 1910! 

During the next transit of 
1769, David Rittenhouse of Phila- 
delphia made the same d'scov- 
ery. His report was also mislaid 
for more than a century and 
when it was again seen during 
the transit of 1874, it was con- 
sidered a great novelty! 

After the next transit, that of 
1882, it was established that the 
same phenomenon can some- 
times be observed even when 
Venus is not in transit. As has 
been said before, Venus normally 
is “above” or “below” the Sun 
when the planet passes Earth. 
But on these occasions, Venus 
may be quite “near” the Sun 
along the line of sight and then 
one can spot the planet in the 
daylight sky as a very thin ring 
of light. 

Unfortunately, this phenome- 
non only tells us that Venus has 
an atmosphere. It does not tell 
us how deep it is. The true 
diameter of Venus, therefore, is 
still unknown. Nor do we know 
the mass of Venus. The books 
usually state that the mass of 
Venus is 80% of the mass of 
Earth and the surface gravity of 
the planet is also given as that 
of Earth minus 20 per cent. Well, 
it probably is near that value, but 
we can’t be completely certain. 

If Venus had a moon, the mass 
of the planet could be derived 

50 



very readily from the time need- 
ed by that moon to swing around 
its primary. Since Venus is moon- 
less, though, its mass has to be 
derived from its influence on the 
neighboring planets; you get the 
nice paradox that an astronomer 
may check on the movement of 
Mars with the utmost care in 
order to find out how much Venus 
weighs! 

But since Mars is also pulled 
by Earth in one direction and 
by Jupiter in another, with Sat- 
urn exerting some influence, too, 
the final result has to be some- 
what uncertain, although the 
masses of Earth, Mars, Jupiter 
and Saturn are well known be- 
cause all of them do have moons. 

r F , HAT VENUS might have a 
moon was believed for quite 
some time and, as late as 1870, 
the British astronomer Richard 
A. Proctor (in his book Other 
Worlds Than Ours ) did not yet 
dare to say that the older ob- 
servations of a moon of Venus 
had been mistakes. His attitude 
was more or less that there was 
so much historical evidence for 
a moon of Venus that its exist- 
ence had to be accepted with 
some reservations even though it 
had not been seen recently. 

The first to proclaim that 
Venus had a moon had been the 
Neapolitan astronomer Francesco 
Fontana in 1645. His report made 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his famous contemporary Jean 
Dominique Cassini watch for it. 
Cassini thought he saw it in 1666 
and in 1672 he felt sure and 
published his observation. 

But a long time went by until 
somebody else went on record as 
having observed the moon of the 
evening star. In 1740, the English 
astronomer Short announced his 
seeing it, whereupon Mayer in 
Greifswald in Germany started 
looking and succeeded in 1759. 
In 1761, Montaigne in Limoges, 
France, and Rodkier of Copen- 
hagen corroborated the findings 
of Mayer and in 1764 Horrebow 
in Copenhagen and Montbarron 
in Auxerre, France, corroborated 
Rodkier and Montaigne. 

To everybody’s chagrin, that 
moon had failed to show up dur- 
ing the actual transit in 1761. 
Efforts to spot it were quadrupled 
during the transit of 1769, but 
except for one doubtful asser- 
tion, the evidence proved nega- 
tive. 

This failure had been predicted 
by Father Maximilian Hell, S. J., 
of Vienna in 1766. Father Hell 
— fortunately for his calling, the 
word hell merely means “bright” 
or “luminous” in German — had 
said that the moon of Venus was 
merely an optical illusion. The 
bright image of the planet is re- 
flected back into the telescope 
from the cornea of the observer’s 
eye and then “seen” as a smaller 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



image of the same phase near 
the main image. 

Still, people kept looking and 
the two transits of 1874 and 1882 
were again checked for signs of 
a satellite of Venus. The result 
was negative and a Belgian as- 
tronomer, P. Stroobant, set him- 
self the task of finding out what 
the various observers had seen, 
if they had seen anything other 
than Father Hell’s secondary 
image. And he discovered that 
whenever the moon of Venus had 
been reported, the planet had 
been near a small fixed star, one 
just bright enough to be seen 
without a telescope as a faint star. 
In the telescope, it would be 
rather bright, though, of course, 
just a pinpoint of light. 

The stars that had doubled for 
a moon of Venus were found to 
have been 64 Orionis, 71 Orionis 
and mu Tauri. 

W ITH AN object like Venus 
which becomes invisible — 
meaning that all we can see is 
the night side — just when clos- 
est to us, one has to be grateful 
for any definite bit of informa- 
tion. The discovery of the atmo- 
sphere by Lomonosov, Ritten- 
house and Schroeter was one of 
these definite bits. The final dis- 
proof of the existence of a moon 
by Stroobant was another one. 

A third one has been added 
just recently, more than half a 

51 



century later, by Gerard P. 
Kuiper of Yerkes and McDonald 
Observatories, who at long last 
succeeded in establishing the 
position of the axis of Venus. The 
inclination of the equator of 
Venus to the plane of its orbit 
turned out to be 32 degrees, with 
a possible error of 2 degrees 
either way. The axis of Venus 
points in the direction of the con- 
stellation of Cepheus. 

The question of the position of 
the axis of Venus and the closely 
connected problem of the rota- 
tion of Venus and the length of 
its day both have quite a stormy 
history. 

It must first be stated that 
the blinding white disk of cloud- 
veiled Venus is virtually feature- 
less. The area over the poles, 
especially over the south pole, 
looks somewhat brighter on occa- 
sion, while faint and large spots 
seem to be located in the equa- 
torial regions. But none is sharply 
defined and, in any drawing, the 
contrasts have to be exaggerated 
many times in order to be “draw- 
able” at all. Now of course it is 
the surface markings of a planet 
from which you derive its period 
of rotation and the position of 
the equator and of the poles. 

The story of the surface mark- 
ings begins with Jean Dominique 
Cassini, who felt certain that 
Venus turned on its axis at very 
nearly the same rate as Earth. 

52 



The figure he gave in 1666 was 
23 hours and 15 minutes. 

Some eighty years later, Fran- 
cesco Bianchini, one of the mem- 
bers of Pope Clemens XI’s 
commission for calendar reform, 
declared that Cassini had been 
mistaken. It took much longer 
than a day; in fact, it took 24 
days and 8 hours. 

Several decades later, a team 
of German astronomers said that 
it was Bianchini who was wrong 
and that Cassini had been right 
or very nearly so. The length of 
the day on Venus was precisely 
23 hours, 21 minutes and 8 
seconds. 

This was slightly revised in 
about 1841 by the Pere de Vico, 
who thought he could prove a 
diurnal period of 23 hours, 21 
minutes and 22 seconds. 

/"k BVIOUSLY, if the period of 
rotation of Venus were 
something like 23 Vi hours, the 
position of the markings, ob- 
served on successive evenings, 
should be about the same, since 
both Earth and Venus would 
have completed a full rotation 
in the interim. 

But then came Giovanni Vir- 
ginio Schiaparelli, discoverer of 
the Martian “canals” and diligent 
observer of Venus, who said that 
you would find the markings in 
the same positions if the planet 
had not rotated at all in the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Earliest telescopic drawings of Venus, made by Francesco Fontana 
in 1645 and 1646 



meantime. Schiaparelli felt cer- 
tain that both Mercury and 
Venus behaved with respect to 
the Sun as our moon behaves 
with respect to Earth, that they 
always face the Sun with the 
same hemisphere — in other 
words, that they performed one 
rotation per revolution around 
the Sun. 

As regards Mercury, Schiapar- 
elli’s opinion has been fully 
accepted by everybody. With re- 
spect to Venus, it had to be 
rejected, for the observed facts do 
not fit the theory and the ob- 
served fact here is one of the few 



things we actually and definitely 
do know about Venus — the 
existence of the atmosphere. 

Let us try to imagine what 
would happen if Schiaparelli 
were right. More specifically, let 
us imagine what would happen 
if the rotation of Venus were 
stopped right now so that the 
sunlight would always fall on the 
same hemisphere — sunlight, in- 
cidentally, which is about twice 
as powerful as that received by 
Earth. 

The heated air would rise and 
flow across the terminator to the 
dark side. There it would cool 



off, shed what moisture it may 
have contained and return to the 
daylight side, picking up more 
moisture for the return trip to 
the night side. After a relatively 
short time, as time is measured 
by astronomers and geologists, 
all the water on the planet would 
be deposited, frozen, on the night 
side, which grows colder and 
colder as time goes on. 

Since the planet is nearly 
Earth size, the area of the night 
side would be large and, in its 
center, a cold pole would develop 
which is no longer warmed by 
the air coming over from the day- 
light side. 

In time, the area of the cold 
pole would be cold enough so 
that the carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere does not return to 
the daylight side. The atmos- 
phere would grow thinner, too; 
it is heated enough for a portion 
to be lost into space because a 
number of the molecules would 
certainly acquire escape velocity 
or better. 

With less air to transport heat 
to the night side, the night side 
cools off even more rapidly and 
grows cold enough to freeze the 
gases. 

In the end, all the moisture 
and a portion of the atmosphere 
would be frozen on the night side, 
while another portion of the at- 
mosphere would have been lost 
in space. 



A LL THIS, of course, would 
have happened many million 
years ago, so that Venus now 
should be an atmosphereless 
planet. 

I might add that condi ions on 
Mercury do not have to be pre- 
cisely the same as just described 
for a hypothetical Venus. Mer- 
cury is much smaller than Venus, 
which means that its escape vel- 
ocity is less and, being closer to 
the Sun, it is heated up more. Any 
atmosphere which Mercury might 
have had was probably lost in 
space, and what moisture there 
was might well be frozen on the 
night side. 

In the case of Mercury, this 
might have taken much longer 
because it has a rather wide “twi- 
light belt” because of its very 
eccentric orbit. Venus, running 
along a nearly circular orbit, can- 
not have a twilight belt of any 
width. 

So we are sure that Schiapar- 
elli was wrong with respect to 
Venus. The planet must have a 
diurnal rotation but the question 
of what it is is still unsolved. 

If, for example, Cassini had 
been right, we could now detect 
this rotation by the Doppler ef- 
fect. But the Doppler effect does 
not give any reading, which 
means that the rotation must be 
slower than that of Earth, longer, 
say, than 100 hours. On the other 
hand, it cannot be very much

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Orbits of Venus and Earth and Venus' appearance in various 
positions. When showing phase C, Venus has maximum brightness 



more than 100 hours because, if 
it were, the temperature of the 
upper layers of the atmosphere 
should be quite different on the 
daylight and on the night side. 

But what differences have 
been measured are not very 
large — and somewhat uncertain, 
too. From what we now know, 
which is admittedly not enough, 
the period of rotation of Venus 
seems to be in the vicinity of 
20 days. 

Now for the markings. 

They are, as has been men- 
tioned, quite faint and indistinct 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



and consist mainly in the fact 
that the polar regions look some- 
what brighter than the equatorial 
areas. Bianchini, after many ob- 
servations, came to the conclu- 
sion that there were a number 
of interconnected equatorial seas 
which he named Mare Galilei, 
Mare Columbi, Mare Vespucci 
and so forth. 

The German Schroeter cen- 
tered his attention on the polar 
areas and announced that he had 
caught glimpses of an enormous 
mountain near the south pole, a 
mountain that had to be about 

55 




45 miles high. Since no mountain 
of such a height is possible — 
its own weight would cause it to 
“settle” — Schroeter was prob- 
ably deceived by an isolated high 
cloud. 

TN 1891, just after, Schiaparelli 

had published his conclusions 
about the rotation of Venus, the 
astronomer Niesten, who did not 
agree with him at all, published 
a map of Venus (Fig. 3) which 
has remained the only one of its 
kind after Bianchini’s. 

Some seven or eight years 
later, W. Villiger, an astronomer 
in Munich, took a few rubber 
balls, dipped them in flat white 
paint and made a few spheres of 
plaster of Paris. Then he placed 
them at such a distance that, 
when observed through a small 
telescope, they would show the 
same angular diameter as Venus 
does in a larger telescope. And 
he illuminated them in the man- 
ner in which Venus is illuminated 
by the Sun. After that, he had 
some graduate students make 
drawings of them and also pro- 
duced a few of his own. The fea- 
tureless white spheres looked 
much brighter around their 
“poles” and acquired some vague- 
ly elliptical grayish areas near 
their middle. 

It was quite evident then that 
no astronomer had ever succeed- 
ed in seeing the surface of Venus. 

56 



Even though definite indentations 
in the terminator have been seen, 
such irregularities in the cloud 
layer did not open a vista of the 
surface. 

I said on one occasion in the 
past that Venus seems to be at 
least triple-veiled, for every over- 
cast develops a hole once in a 
while, and even in a double over- 
cast the holes should occasion- 
ally match. With a triple layer 
of clouds, the probability of the 
matching of holes — which are 
evidently rare events to begin 
with — becomes invisibly small. 
In short, the clouds of Venus are, 
as one writer phrased it, as 
opaque as marshmallows. 

But what are they? For many 
years, they were taken to be 
water vapor without question 
and, at the beginning of this 
century, the surface of Venus was 
universally considered “dripping 
wet.” If there was a difference in 
opinion, it was merely about the 
degree of wetness. When asked, 
most astronomers would haul a 
book on geology off the shelf, 
point at a picture depicting a 
carboniferous forest and say, 
“This is how it must look.” 

Only a few considered the 
possibility that Venus was a pan- 
thalassa, meaning that it was cov- 
ered by a shoreless ocean without 
any considerable land masses at 
all, or possibly just a few islands. 

The view of a dripping wet

Venus was still held by as im- 
portant a scientist as Svante Arr- 
henius in 1918. 

J UST one decade later, opinion 
had completely reversed itself, 
largely as the result of a long 
series of pictures taken by F. E. 
Ross at Mt. Wilson Observatory 
in 1927. The new view was that 
Venus was completely dry, that 
violent storms picked up dust 
from the endless desert, forming 
a dust-cloud layer beneath the 
other cloud layers. 

One of the results of this work 
was that, while the markings seen 
with the telescope might be opti- 
cal illusions, there were markings 
that could be photographed, pro- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



vided you photographed them in 
violet and ultra-violet, for they 
do not show up in light of the 
wave-lengths the eye can see best. 
(Dr. Kuiper’s determination of 
the position of Venus’ axis is also 
based on such photographs.) The 
reason for postulating absolute 
dryness was that neither water 
nor oxygen could be detected 
spectroscopically, but that an- 
other set of lines showed up well 
which was then identified as be- 
longing to carbon dioxide. 

But negative evidence is often 
insufficient grounds for building 
conclusions. The statement that 
neither water nor oxygen has 
been found in the atmosphere of 
Venus should really read that 

57 



neither water nor oxygen has 
been found above the clouds. And 
one can easily explain why there 
couldn’t be any above the clouds. 

The spectroscope can only de- 
tect water vapor, not water, and 
the highest clouds of Venus must 
be quite high up. If, for the sake 
of discussion, we compare the 
atmosphere of Venus with that 
of Earth, the clouds might be 10 
miles from the surface, but in 
the terrestrial atmosphere, the 
temperature ten miles up is minus 
67° Fahrenheit. Any water at 
ten miles would be in the form 
of ice crystals, so the clouds 
themselves would be ice crystals. 
And ice crystals do not show up 
in the spectroscope. 

Likewise, any oxygen present 
would be past the stage of oxygen 
molecules, but would be single 
oxygen atoms because of the 
powerful solar radiation. I don’t 
know where the bands caused by 
oxygen atoms would be in a 
spectrogram, but certainly not in 
or near the place where one looks 
for the bands of oxygen — that 
is to say, oxygen molecules. 

S O, WHILE the picture of the 
bone-dry planet fits what ob- 
servations there are, it is not 
necessarily the truth. In fact, 
Donald H. Menzel and Fred L. 
Whipple of Harvard Observatory 
have shown recently that the 



existing observations would also 
fit a panthalassa, incidentally one 
where the oceans consist of car- 
bonated water — seltzer! 

In short, Venus is either com- 
pletely dry or completely wet. 
But can we ever find out which 
it is? Probably not until a new 
factor enters into the picture — 
space travel. 

Just to observe from outside 
our own atmosphere would be an 
incredible boon to astronomers; 
the constitution of the atmos- 
phere of Venus above its highest 
cloud layer could indubitably be 
established from the space sta- 
tion. The precise mass of Venus 
could be established by means of 
a slightly more elaborate experi- 
ment. One could fire a missile 
from the space station in such a 
manner that its path would be 
bent by the gravitational field of 
Venus. Careful observation of the 
path of this missile would settle 
the problem once and for all. 

But to learn what is below the 
cloud layer, we would have to go 
a bit closer. A method that comes 
to mind without much delibera- 
tion is to fire sampling missiles 
into the atmosphere of Venus 
from a nearby ship. In the end, 
it might be possible to lower a 
reporting missile all the way to 
the ground. 

And then we’ll know.

Qne for the books 

When he woke up that morning 
a weird thing had happened . 
he could speak fluent French! 



W HEN he woke up that 
morning, he could talk 
French. 

There was no warning. At six- 
fifteen, the alarm went off as 
usual and he and his wife stirred. 
Fred reached out a sleep-dead- 
ened hand and shut off the bell. 
The room was still for a moment. 

Then Eva pushed back the 
covers on her side and he pushed 
back the covers on his side. His 
vein-gnarled legs dropped over 
the side of the bed. He said, “Bon 
matin, Eva.” 

There was a slight pause. 
“Wha’P” she asked. 

“Je dis bon matin,” he said. 
There was a rustle of night- 
gown as she twisted around to 
squint at him. “What’d you say?” 



“All I said was good — ” 

Fred Elderman stared back at 
his wife. 

“What did I say?” he asked in 
a whisper. 

“You said “bone mattin or — ” 
“Je dis bon matin. C’est un bon 
matin, n’est ce pas?” 

The sound of his hand being 
clapped across his mouth was 
like that of a fast ball thumping 
in a catcher’s mitt. Above the 
knuckle-ridged gag, his eyes were 
shocked. 

“Fred, what IS it?” 

CLOWLY, the hand drew down 
k-' from his lips. 

“I dunno, Eva,” he said, awed.

Unconsciously, the hand reached 
up, one finger of it rubbing at 
his hair-ringed bald spot. “It 
sounds like some — some kind of 
foreign talk.” 

“But you don’t know no for- 
eign talk, Fred,” she told him. 

“That’s just it.” 

They sat there looking at each 
other blankly. Fred glanced over 
at the clock. 

“We better get dressed,” he 
said. 

While he was in the bathroom, 
she heard him singing, “Elle fit 
un fromage, du lait du ses mou- 
ton, ton, ton, du lait du ses mou- 
ton,” but she didn’t dare call it 
to his attention while he was 
shaving. 

Over breakfast coffee, he mut- 
tered something. 

“What?” she asked before she 
could stop herself. 

“Je dis que vous dire ceci?” 

He heard the coffee go down 
her gulping throat. 

“I mean,” he said, looking 
dazed, “what does this mean?” 

“Yes, what does it? You never 
talked no foreign language be- 
fore.” 

“I know it,” he said, toast sus- 
pended halfway to his open 
mouth. “What — what kind of 
language is it?” 

“S-sounds t’me like French.” 

“French? I don’t know no 
French.” 

She swallowed more coffee. 



“You do now,” she said weakly. 
He stared at the table cloth. 
“Le diable s’en mele” he mut- 
tered. 

Her voice rose. “Fred, what?” 
His eyes were confused. “I said 
the devil has something to do 
with it.” 

“Fred, you’re — ” 

She straightened up in the 
chair and took a deep breath. 
“Now,” she said, “let’s not pro- 
fane, Fred. There has to be a 
good reason for this.” No reply. 
“Well, doesn’t there, Fred?” 
“Sure, Eva. Sure. But — ” 

“No buts about it,” she de- 
clared, plunging ahead as if she 
were afraid to stop. “Now is there 
any reason in this world why you 
should know how to talk 
French — ” she snapped her thin 
fingers — “just like that?” 

He shook his head vaguely. 
“Well,” she went on, wonder- 
ing what to say next, “let’s see 
then.” They looked at each other 
in silence. “Say something,” she 
decided. “Let’s — ” She groped 
for words. “Let’s see what we . 
have here.” Her voice died off. 
“Say somethin’?” 

“Yes,” she said. “Go on.” 

“Un gemissement se fit enten- 
dre. Le s dogues se mettent a 
aboyer. Ces gens me vont bien. 
11 va sur le s quinze ans — ” 
“Fred?” 

“11 fit fabriquer une exacte re- 
presentation du monstre.”

“Fred, hold on!’’ she cried, 
looking scared. 

His voice broke off and he 
looked at her, blinking. 

“What . what did you say 
this time, Fred?” she asked. 

“I said — a moan was heard. 
His mastiffs began to bark. These 
gloves fit me. He will soon be 
fifteen years old and — ” 

“What?” 

“And he had an exact copy of 
the monster made. Sans meme 
I’entamer.” 

“Fred?" 

He looked ill. “Without even 
scratchin’,” he said. 

A T that hour of the morning, 
the campus was quiet. The 
only classes that early were the 
two seven-thirty Economics lec- 
tures and they were held on the 
.White Campus. Here on the Red 
there was no sound. In an hour, 
the walks would be filled with 
chatting, laughing, loafer-click- 
ing student hordes, but for now 
there was peace. 

In far less than peace, Fred 
Elderman shuffled along the 
east side of the campus, headed 
for the administration building. 
Having left a confused Eva at 
home, he’d been trying to figure 
it out as he went to work. 

What was it? When had it be- 
gun? C’esf une heure, said his 
mind. 

He shook his head angrily. 



This was terrible. He tried des- 
perately to think of what could 
have happened, but he couldn’t. 
It just didn’t make sense. He was 
59, a janitor at the university 
with no education to speak of, 
living a quiet, ordinary life. Then 
he woke up one morning speak- 
ing articulate French. 

French. 

He stopped a moment and 
stood in the frosty October wind, 
staring at the cupola of Jeramy 
Hall. He’d cleaned out the 
French office the night before. 
Could that have anything to do 
with — 

No, that was ridiculous. He 
started off again, muttering under 
his breath — unconsciously. “Je 
suis, tu es, il est, elle est, nous 
sommes, vous etes — ” 

At eight-ten, he entered the 
History Department office to re- 
pair a sink in the washroom. He 
worked on it for an hour and 
seven minutes, then put the tools 
back in the bag and walked out 
into the office. 

“Mornin’,” he said to the pro- 
fessor sitting at a desk. 

“Good morning, Fred,” said 
the professor. 

Fred Elderman walked out 
into the hall thinking how re- 
markable it was that the income 
of Louis XVI, from the same type 
of taxes, exceeded those of Louis 
XV by 130 million livre and that 
the exports which had been 106 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



million in 1720 were 192 million 
in 1746 and — 

He stopped in the hall, a stun- 
ned look on his lean face. 

That morning, he had occasion 
to be in the offices of the Physics, 
the Chemistry, the English and 
the Art Departments. 

rpHE WINDMILL was a little 
tavern near Main Street. 
Fred went there Monday, Wed- 
nesday and Friday evenings to 
nurse a couple of draught beers 
and chat with his two friends — 
Harry Bullard, manager of Ho- 
gan’s Bowling Alleys, and Lou 
Peacock, postal worker and ama- 
teur gardener. 

Stepping into the doorway of 
the dimlit saloon that evening, 
Fred was heard — by an exiting 
patron — to murmur, “Je connais 
tous ces brave gens,” then look 
around with a guilty twitch of 
cheek. “I mean . .” he muttered, 
but didn’t finish. 

Harry Bullard saw him first 
in the mirror. Twisting his head 
around on its fat column of neck, 
he said, “C’mon in, Fred, the 
whiskey’s fine,” then, to the bar- 
tender, “Draw one fer the elder 
man,” and chuckled. 

Fred walked to the bar with 
the first smile he’d managed to 
summon that day. Peacock and 
Bullard greeted him and the bar- 
tender set down a brimming 
stein. 



“What’s new, Fred?” Harry 
asked. 

Fred pressed his mustache be- 
tween two foam-removing fin- 
gers. 

“Not much,” he said, still too 
uncertain to discuss it. Dinner 
with Eva had been a painful meal 
during which he’d eaten not only 
food but an endless and detailed 
running commentary on the 
Thirty Years War, the Magna 
Charta and boudoir information 
about Catherine the Great. He 
had been glad to retire from the 
house at seven-thirty, murmur- 
ing an unmanageable, “Bon nuit, 
ma c here.” 

“What’s new with you?” he 
asked Harry Bullard now. 

“Well,” Harry answered, “we 
been paintin’ down at the alleys. 
You know, redecoratin’.” 

“That right?” Fred said. 
“When painting with colored 
beeswax was inconvenient, Greek 
and Roman easel painters used 
tempera — that is, colors fixed 
upon a wood or stucco base by 
means of such a medium as — ” 

He stopped. There was a bulg- 
ing silence. 

“Harh?” Harry Bullard asked. 

Fred swallowed nervously. 
“Nothing,” he said hastily. “I 
was just—” He stared down into 
the tan depths of his beer. “Noth- 
ing,” he repeated. 

Bullard glanced at Peacock, 
who shrugged back.

“How are your hothouse flow- 
ers coming, Lou?” Fred inquired, 
to change the subject. 

The small man nodded. “Fine. 
They’re just fine.” 

“Good,” said Fred, nodding, 
too. “Vi sono pui di cinquante 
bastimenti in porto.” He gritted 
his teeth and closed his eyes. 

“What’s that?” Lou asked, 
cupping one ear. 

Fred coughed on his hastily 
swallowed beer. “Nothing,” he 
said. 

“No, what did ya say?” Harry 
persisted, the half-smile on his 
broad face indicating that he was 
ready to hear a good joke. 

“I — I said there are more than 
fifty ships in the harbor,” ex- 
plained Fred morosely. 

The smile faded. Harry looked 
blank. 

“What harbor?” he asked. 

Fred tried to sound casual. “I 
— it’s just a joke I heard today. 
But I forget the last line.” 

“Oh.” Harry stared at Fred, 
then returned to his drink. 
“Yeah.” 

They were quiet a moment. 
Then Lou asked Fred, “Through 
for the day?” 

“No. I have to clean up the 
Math office later.” 

Lou nodded. “That’s too bad.” 

F RED squeezed more foam 
from his mustache. “Tell me 
something,” he said, taking the 



plunge impulsively. “What would 
you think if you woke up one 
morning talking French?” 

“Who did that?” asked Harry, 
squinting. 

“Nobody,” Fred said hurried- 
ly. “Just . supposing, I mean. 
Supposing a man was to — well, 
to know things he never learned. 
You know what I mean? Just 
know them. As if they were al- 
ways in his mind and he was 
seeing them for the first time.” 
“What kind o’ things, Fred?” 
asked Lou. 

“Oh . history. Different . 
languages. Things about . 
books and painting and . and 
atoms and — chemicals.” His 
shrug was jerky and obvious. 
“Things like that.” 

“Don’t get ya, buddy,” Harry 
said, having given up any hopes 
that a joke was forthcoming. 

“You mean he knows things 
he never learned?” Lou asked. 
“That it?” 

There was something in both 
their voices — a doubting incredu- 
lity, a holding back, as if they 
feared to commit themselves, a 
suspicious reticence. 

Fred sloughed it off. “I was 
just supposing. Forget it. It’s not 
worth talking about.” 

He had only one beer that 
night, leaving early with the ex- 
cuse that he had to clean the 
Mathematics office. And, all 
through the silent minutes that 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he swept and mopped and dust- 
ed, he kept trying to figure out 
what was happening to him. 

He walked home in the chill 
of night to find Eva waiting for 
him in the kitchen. 

“Coffee, Fred?” she offered. 

“I’d like that,” he said, nod- 
ding. She started to get up. “No, 
s 'accomadi, la prego,” he blurted. 

She looked at him, grim-faced. 

“I mean,” he translated, “sit 
down, Eva. I can get it.” 

They sat there drinking coffee 
while he told her about his ex- 
periences. 

“It’s more than I can figure, 
Eva,” he said. “It’s . scary, in 
a way. I know so many things I 
never knew. I have no idea where 
they come from. Not the least 
idea.” His lips pressed together. 
“But I know them,” he said, “I 
certainly know them.” 

“More than just . French 
now?” she asked. 

H E shook his head worriedly. 

“Lots more.” he said. “Like 
— ” He looked up from his cup. 
“Listen to this. Main progress in 
producing fast particles has been 
made by using relatively small 
voltages and repeated accelera- 
tion. In most of the instruments 
used, charged particles are driven 
around in circular or spiral orbits

He saw her adam’s apple move.

“I’m listenin’,” she said. 

“ — help of a magnetic field. 
The acceleration can be applied 
in different ways. In the so-called 
betatron of Kerst and Serber — ” 
“What does it mean, Fred?” 
she interrupted. 

“I don’t know,” he said help- 
lessly. “It’s . just words in my 
head. I know what it means when 
I say something in a foreign 
tongue, but . this?” 

She shivered, clasping at her 
forearms abruptly. 

“It’s not right,” she said. 

He frowned at her in silence 
for a long moment. 

“What do you mean, Eva?” he 
asked then. 

“I don’t know, Fred,” she said 
quietly and shook her head once, 
slowly. “I just don’t know.” 

She woke up about midnight 
and heard him mumbling in his 
sleep. 

“The natural logarithms of 
whole numbers from ten to two 
hundred. Number one — zero — 
two point three oh two six. One 
— two point three nine seven 
nine. T wo — two point — ” 

“Fred, go t’sleep,” she said, 
frowning nervously. 

“ — four eight four nine.” 

She prodded him with an el- 
bow. “Go t ’sleep, Fred.” 
“Three-two point — ” 

“Fred!” 

“Huh?” He moaned and swal- 
lowed dryly, turned on his side. 

65 



In the darkness, she heard him 
shape the pillow with sleep-heavy 
hands. 

“Fred?” she called softly. 

He coughed. “What?” 

“I think you better go t’Doctor 
Boone t’morra mornin’.” 

She heard him draw in a long 
breath, then let it filter out even- 
ly until it was all gone. 

“I think so, too,” he said in a 
blurry voice. 

O N Friday morning, when he 
opened the door to the wait- 
ing room of Doctor William 
Boone, a draft of wind scattered 
papers from the nurse’s desk. 

“Oh,” he said apologetically. 
“Le chieggo scuse. Non ne val la 
pena.” 

Miss Agnes McCarthy had 
been Doctor Boone’s receptionist- 
nurse for seven years and in that 
time she’d never heard Fred El- 
derman speak a single foreign 
word. 

Thus she goggled at him, 
amazed. “What’s that you said?” 
she asked. 

Fred’s smile was a nervous 
twitch of lips. 

“Nothing,” he said, “miss.” 

Her returned smile was formal. 
“Oh.” She cleared her throat. 
“I’m sorry Doctor couldn’t see 
you yesterday.” 

“That’s all right,” he told her. 
“He’ll be ready in about ten 
minutes.” 



Twenty minutes later, Fred 
sat down beside Boone’s desk and 
the heavy-set doctor leaned back 
in his chair with an, “Ailing, 
Fred?” 

Fred explained the situation. 

The doctor’s cordial smile be- 
came, in order, amused, fixed, 
strained and finally non-existent. 

“This is really so?” he de- 
manded. 

Fred nodded with grim delib- 
eration. “Je me laisse conseiller." 

Doctor Boone’s heavy eye- 
brows lifted a noticeable jot. 
“French,” he said. “What’d you 
say?” 

Fred swallowed. “I said I’m 
willing to be advised.” 

“Son of a gun,” intoned Doctor 
Boone, plucking at his lower lip. 
“Son of a gun.” He got up and 
ran exploring hands over Fred’s 
skull. “You haven’t received a 
head blow lately, have you?” 

“No,” said Fred. “Nothing.” 

“Hmmm.” Doctor Boone drew 
away his hands and let them 
drop to his sides. “Well, no ap- 
parent bumps or cracks.” He 
buzzed for Miss McCarthy. Then 
he said, “Well, let’s take a try 
at the X-rays.” 

The X-rays revealed no break 
or blot. 

The two men sat in the office, 
discussing it. 

“Hard to believe,” said the 
doctor, shaking his head. Fred 
sighed despondently. “Well, don’t 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



take on so,” Boone said. “It’s 
nothing to be disturbed about. 
So you’re a quiz kid, so what?” 
Fred ran nervous fingers over 
his mustache. “But there’s no 
sense to it. Why is it happening? 
What is it? The fact is, I’m a 
little scared.” 

“Nonsense, Fred. Nonsense. 
You’re in good physical condi- 
tion. That I guarantee.” 

“But what about my — ” Fred 
hesitated — “my brain?” 

Doctor Boone stuck out his 
lower lip in consoling derision, 
shaking his head. “I wouldn’t 
worry about that, either.” He 
slapped one palm on the desk 
top. “Let me think about it, Fred. 
Consult a few associates. You 
know — analyze it. Then I’ll let 
you know. Fair enough?” 

He walked Fred to the door. 
“In the meantime,” he pre- 
scribed, “no worrying about it. 
There isn’t a thing to worry 
about.” 

His face as he dialed the phone 
a few minutes later was not un- 
worried, however. 

“Fetlock?” he said, getting his 
party. “Got a poser for you.” 

H ABIT more than thirst 
brought Fred to the Wind- 
mill that evening. Eva had want- 
ed him to stay home and rest, as- 
suming that his state was due to 
overwork; but Fred had insisted 
that it wasn’t his health and left 



the house, just managing to 
muffle his “Au revolt.” 

He joined Harry Bullard and 
Lou Peacock at the bar and fin- 
ished his first beer in a glum si- 
lence while Harry revealed why 
they shouldn’t vote for Legislator 
Milford Carpenter. 

“Tell ya the man’s got a pri- 
vate line t’Moscow,” he said. “A 
few men like that in office and 
we’re in for it, take my word.” 
He looked over at Fred staring 
into his beer. “What’s with it, 
elder man?” he asked, clapping 
Fred on the shoulder. 

Fred told them — as if he were 
telling about a disease he’d 
caught. 

Lou Peacock looked incredu- 
lous. “So that’s what you were 
talking about the other night!” 

Fred nodded. 

“You’re not kiddin’ us now?” 
Harry asked. “Y’know every- 
thing?” 

“Just about,” Fred admitted 
sadly. 

A shrewd look overcame 
Harry’s face. 

“What if I ask ya somethin’ ya 
don’t know?” 

“I’d be happy,” Fred said in 
a despairing voice. 

Harry beamed. “Okay. I won’t 
ask ya about atoms nor chemic- 
als nor anythin’ like that. I’ll just 
ask ya t’tell me about the coun- 
try between my home town Au 
Sable and Tarva.” He hit the bar 



ONE FOR THE BOOKS 



67 



with a contented slap. 

Fred looked hopeful briefly, 
but then his face blanked and he 
said in an unhappy voice. “Be- 
tween Au Sable and Tarva, the 
route is through typical cut-over 
land that once was covered with 
virgin pine (danger: deer on the 
highway ) and now has only sec- 
ond growth oak, pine and pop- 
lar. For years after the decline of 
the lumber industry, picking 

huckleberries was one of the chief 

•• 

local occupations.” 

Harry gaped. 

“Because the berries were 
known to grow in the wake of 
fires,” Fred concluded, “residents 
deliberately set many fires that 
roared through the country.” 

“That’s a damn dirty lie!” 
Harry said, chin trembling bel- 
ligerently. 

Fred looked at him in surprise. 

“You shouldn’t ought t’go 
around tellin’ lies like that,” 
Harry said. “You call that know- 
in’ the countryside — telling lies 
about it?” 

“Take it easy, Harry,” Lou 
cautioned. 

“Well,” Harry said angrily, 
“he shouldn’t ought to tell lies 
like that.” 

“I didn’t say it,” Fred an- 
swered hopelessly. “It’s more as 
though I — I read it off.” 

“Yeah? Well . Harry fin- 
gered his glass restlessly. 

“You really know everything?” 



Lou asked, partly to ease the 
tension, partly because he was 
awed. 

“I’m afraid so,” Fred replied. 

“You ain’t just . playin’ a 
trick?” 

Fred shook his head. “No 
trick.” 

T OU PEACOCK looked small 
and intense. “What can you 
tell me,” he asked in a back- 
alley voice, “about orange roses?” 

The blank look crossed Fred’s 
face again. Then he recited, 
“Orange is not a fundamental 
color but a blend of red and pink 
of varied intensity and yellow. 
There were very few orange roses 
prior to the Pernatia strain. All 
orange, apricot, chamois and 
coral roses finish with pink more 
or less accentuated. Some attain 
that lovely shade — Cuisse de 
Nymphe emue.” 

Lou Peacock was open-mouth- 
ed. “Ain’t that something?” 

Harry Bullard blew out heavy 
breath. “What d’ya know about 
Carpenter?” he asked pugna- 
ciously. 

“Carpenter, Milford, born 1898 
in Chicago, Illi — ” 

“Never mind,” Harry cut in. 
“I ain’t interested. He’s a Com- 
mie; that’s all I gotta know 
about him.” 

“The elements that go into a 
political campaign,” quoth Fred 
helplessly, “are many — the per- 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sonality of the candidates, the 
issues — if any — the attitude of 
the press, economic groups, tradi- 
tions, the opinion polls, the — ” 

“I tell ya he’s a Commie!” 
Harry declared, voice rising. 

“You voted for him last elec- 
tion,” Lou said. “As I re — ” 

“I did not!” snarled Harry, 
getting redder in the face. 

The blank look appeared on 
Fred Elderman’s face. “Remem- 
bering things that are not so is 
a kind of memory distortion that 
goes by several names such as 
pathological lying or mytho- 
mania.” 

“You callin’ me a liar, Fred?” 

“It differs from ordinary lying 
in that the speaker comes to be- 
lieve his own lies and — ” 

“Where did you get that black 
eye?” a shocked Eva asked Fred 
when he came into the kitchen 
later. “Have you been fighting 
at your age?” 

Then she saw the look on his 
face and ran for the refrigerator. 
She sat him on a chair and held 
a piece of beefsteak against his 
swelling eye while he related 
what had happened. 

“He’s a bully,” she said. “A 
bully!” 

“No, I don’t blame him,” Fred 
disagreed. “I insulted him. I 
don’t even know what I’m saying 
any more. I’m — I’m all mixed 
up.” 

She looked down at his slump- 

ONE FOR THE BOOKS 



ed form, an alarmed expression 
on her face. “When is Doctor 
Boone going to do something for 
you?” 

“I don’t know.” 

A half hour later, against Eva’s 
wishes, he went to clean up the 
library with a fellow janitor; but 
the moment he entered the huge 
room, he gasped, put his hands 
to his temples and fell down on 
one knee, gasping, “My head! 
My head!” 

It took a long while of sitting 
quietly in the downstairs hallway 
before the pain in his skull stop- 
ped. He sat there staring fixedly 
at the glossy tile floor, his head 
feeling as if it had just gone 
twenty-nine rounds with the 
heavyweight champion of the 
world. 

T^ETLOCK came in the morn- 
ing. Arthur B., 42, short and 
stocky, head of the Department 
of Psychological Sciences, he 
came bustling along the path in 
porkpie hat and checkered over- 
coat, jumped up on the porch, 
stepped across its worn boards 
and stabbed at the bell button. 
While he waited, he clapped 
leather-gloved hands together 
energetically and blew out breath 
clouds. 

“Yes?” Eva asked when she 
opened the door. 

Professor Fetlock explained 
his mission, not noticing how her 

69 



face tightened with fright when 
he announced his field. Reas- 
sured that Doctor Boone had sent 
him, she led Fetlock up the car- 
peted steps, explaining, “He’s 
still in bed. He had an attack 
last night.” 

“Oh?” said Arthur Fetlock. 

When introductions had been 
made and he was alone with the 
janitor, Professor Fetlock fired a 
rapid series of questions. Fred 
Elderman, propped up with pil- 
lows, answered them as well as 
he could. 

“This attack,” said Fetlock, 
“what happened?” 

“Don’t know, Professor. Walk- 
ed in the library and — well, it 
was as if a ton of cement hit me 
on the head. No — in my head.” 

“Amazing. And this knowledge 
you say you’ve acquired — are 
you conscious of an increase in 
it since your ill-fated visit to the 
library?” 

Fred nodded. “I know more 
than ever.” 

The professor bounced the fin- 
gertips of both hands against 
each other. “A book on language 
by Pei. Section 9-B in the library, 
book number 429.2, if memory 
serves. Can you quote from it?” 

Fred looked blank, but words 
followed almost immediately. 
“Leibnitz first advanced the 
theory that all language came not 
from a historically recorded 
source but from proto-speech. In 



some respects he was a precursor 
of—” 

“Good, good,” said Arthur Fet- 
lock. “Apparently a case of spon- 
taneous telepathic manifestations 
coupled with clairvoyance.” 

“Meaning?” 

“Telepathy, Elderman. Tele- 
pathy! Seems every book or edu- 
cated mind you come across, you 
pick clean of content. You work- 
ed in the French office, you spoke 
French. You worked in the 
Mathematics office, you quoted 
numbers, tables, axioms. Similar- 
ly with all other offices, subjects 
and individuals.” He scowled, 
purse-lipped. “Ah, but why?” 

‘‘Causa qua re muttered 
Fred. 

A brief wry sound in Profes- 
sor Fetlock’s throat. “Yes, I wish 
I knew, too. However . He 
leaned forward. “What’s that?” 

“How come I can .learn so 
much?” Fred asked worriedly. “I 
mean — ” 

“No difficulty there,” stated 
the stocky psychologist. “You 
see, no man ever utilized the full 
learning capacity of the brain. It 
still has an immense potential. 
Perhaps that’s what’s happening 
to you — you’re realizing this po- 
tential.” 

“But how?” 

“Spontaneously realized tele- 
pathy and clairvoyance plus in- 
finite retention and unlimited 
potential.” He whistled softly.

“Amazing. Positively amazing. 
Well, I must be going.” 

“But what’ll I do?” Fred beg- 
ged. 

“Why, enjoy it,” said the pro- 
fessor expansively. “It’s a per- 
fectly fantastic gift. Now look — 
if I were to gather together a 
group of faculty members, would 
you be willing to speak to them? 
Informally, of course.” 

“But—” 

“They should be entranced, 
positively entranced. I must do 
a paper for the Journal .” 

“But what does it mean, Pro- 
fessor?” Fred Elderman asked, 
his voice shaking. 

“Oh, we’ll look into it, never 
fear. Really, this is revolutionary. 
An unparalleled phenomenon.” 
He made a sound of delighted 
disbelief. “In-credible.” 

VV/HEN Professor Fetlock had 
™ gone, Fred sat defeatedly 
in his bed. So there was noth- 
ing to be done — nothing but 
spout endless, inexplicable words 
and wonder into the nights what 
terrible thing was happening to 
him. Maybe the professor was 
excited; maybe it was exciting 
intellectual fare for outsiders. For 
him, it was only grim and in- 
creasingly frightening business. 

Why? Why? It was the ques- 
tion he could neither answer nor 
escape. 

He was thinking that when Eva 



came in. He lifted his gaze as she 
crossed the room and sat down 
on the bed. 

“What did he say?” she asked 
anxiously. 

When he told her, her reaction 
was the same as his. 

“That’s all? Enjoy it?” She 
pressed her lips together in anger. 
“What’s the matter with him? 
Why did Doctor Boone send 
him?” 

He shook his head, without an 
answer. 

There was such a look of con- 
fused fear on his face that she 
reached out her hand suddenly 
and touched his cheek. “Does 
your head hurt, dear?” 

“It hurts inside,” he said. “In 
my ...” There was a clicking 
in his throat. “If one considers 
the brain as a tissue which is 
only moderately compressible, 
surrounded by two variable fac- 
tors — the blood it contains and 
the spinal fluid which surrounds 
it and fills the ventricles inside 
the brain we have — ” 

He broke off spasmodically and 
sat there, quivering. 

“God help us,” she whispered. 

“As Sextus Empiricus says in 
his Arguments Against Belief in 
a God, those who affirm, posi- 
tively, that God exists cannot 
avoid falling into an impiety. 
For—” 

“Fred, stop it!” 

He sat looking at her dazedly.

“Fred, you don’t . know 
what you’re saying. Do you?” 
“No. I never do. I just — Eva, 
what’s going on!” 

She held his hand tightly and 
stroked it. “It’s all right, Fred. 
Please don’t worry so.” 

But he did worry. For behind 
the complex knowledge that filled 
his mind, he was still the same 
man, simple, uncomprehending — 
and afraid. 

Why was it happening? 

It was as if, in some hideous 
way, he were a sponge filling 
more and more with knowledge 
and there would come a time 
when there was no room left and 
the sponge would explode. 

P ROFESSOR Fetlock stopped 
him in the hallway Monday 
morning. “Elderman, I’ve spoken 
to the members of the faculty and 
they’re all as excited as I. Would 
this afternoon be too soon? I can 
get you excused from any work 
you may be required to do.” 
Fred looked bleakly at the pro- 
fessor’s enthusiastic face. “It’s 
all right.” 

“Splendid! Shall we say four- 
thirty then? My offices?” 

“All right.” 

“And may I make a sugges- 
tion?” asked the professor. “I’d 
like you to tour the university — 
all of it.” 

When they separated, Fred 
went back down to the basement 



to put away his tools. 

At four-twenty-five, he pushed 
open the heavy door to the De- 
partment of Psychological Sci- 
ences. He stood there waiting 
patiently, one hand on the knob, 
until someone in the large group 
of faculty members saw him. Pro- 
fessor Fetlock disengaged from 
the group and hurried over. 

“Elderman,” he said, “come in, 
come in.” 

“Professor, has Doctor Boone 
said anything more?” Fred insist- 
ed. “I mean about — ” 

“No, nothing. Never fear, we’ll 
get to it. But come along. I want 
you to — Ladies and gentlemen, 
your attention, please!” 

Fred was introduced to them, 
standing in their midst, trying 
to look at ease when his heart 
and nerves were pulsing with a 
nervous dread. 

“And did you follow my sug- 
gestion,” Fetlock asked loudly, 
“and tour all the departments in 
the university?” 

“Yes . sir.” 

“Good, good.” Professor Fet- 
lock nodded emphatically. “That 
should complete the picture then. 
Imagine it, ladies and gentlemen 
— the sum total of knowledge in 
our entire university — all in the 
head of this one man!” 

There were sounds of doubt 
from the faculty. 

“No, no, I’m serious!” claimed 
Fetlock. “The proof of the pud- 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ding is quite ample. Ask away.” 
Fred Elderman stood there in 
the momentary silence, thinking 
of what Professor Fetlock had 
said. The knowledge of an entire 
university in his head. That 
meant there was no more to be 
gotten here then. 

What now? 

T HEN the questions came — 
and the answers, dead-voiced 
and monotonous. 

“What will happen to the Sun 
in 15 million years?” 

“If the Sun goes on radiating 
at its present rate for 15 million 
years, its whole weight will be 
transformed into radiation.” 
“What is a root tone?” 

“In harmonic units, the con- 
stituent tones seem to have un- 
equal harmonic values. Some 
seem to be more important and 
dominate the sounding unity. 
These roots are — ” 

All the knowledge of an entire 
university in his head. 

“The five orders of Roman 
architecture.” 

“Tuscan, Doric, Corinthian, 
Ionic, Composite, Tuscan being a 
simplified Doric, Doric retaining 
the triglyphs, Corinthian charac- 
terized by — ” 

No more knowledge there he 
didn’t possess. His brain cram- 
med with it. Why? 

“Buffer capacity?” 

“The buffer capacity of a so- 



lution may be defined as dx/dpH 
where dx is the small amount of 
strong acid or — ” 

Why? 

“A moment ago. French.” 

“II n’y a qu’un instant.” 
Endless questions, increasingly 
excited until they were almost 
being shouted. 

“What is literature involved 
with?” 

“Literature is, of its nature, 
involved with ideas because it 
deals with Man in society, which 
is to say that it deals with form- 
ulations, valuations and — ” 

Why? 

“Rule for masthead lights on 
steam vessels?” A laugh. 

“A steam- vessel when under 
way shall carry (a) on or in front 
of the foremast or, if a vessel 
without a foremast, then in the 
forepart of the vessel, a bright, 
white light so constructed as 
to—” 

No laughter. Questions. 

“How would a three-step rock- 
et take off?” 

“The three-step rocket would 
take off vertically and be given 
a slight tilt in an easterly direc- 
tion, Brennschluss taking place 
about — ” 

“Who was Count Bernadotte?” 
“What are the by-products of 
oil?” 

“Which city is—” 

“How can—” 

“What is—”

“When did—” 

And when it was over and he 
had answered every question they 
asked, there was a great, heavy 
silence. He stood trembling and 
yet numb, beginning to get a final 
knowledge. 

The phone rang then and made 
everyone start. 

Professor Fetlock answered it. 
“For you, Elderman.” 

Fred walked over to the phone 
and picked up the receiver. 

“Fred?” he heard Eva say. 
“Oui.” 

“What?” 

He twitched. “I’m sorry, Eva. 
I mean yes, it’s I.” 

H E heard her swallowing on 
the other end of the line. 
“Fred, I . just wondered why 
you didn’t come home, so I called 
your office and Charlie said — ” 
He told her about the meeting. 
“Oh,” she said. “Well, will you 
be — home for supper?” 

The last knowledge was seep- 
ing, rising slowly. 

“I’ll try, Eva. I think so, yes.” 
“I been worried, Fred.” 

He smiled sadly. “Nothing to 
worry about, Eva.” 

Then the message sliced 
abruptly across his mind and he 
said, “Good-by, Eva,” and drop- 
ped the receiver. “I have to go,” 
he told Fetlock and the others. 

He didn’t exactly hear what 
they said in return. The words. 



the transition from room to hall 
were blurred over by his sudden, 
concentrated need to get out on 
the campus. 

The questioning faces were 
gone and he was hurrying down 
the hall on driven feet, his ac- 
tion as his speech had been — 
unmotivated, beyond understand- 
ing. Something drew him on. He 
had spoken without knowing 
why; now he rushed down the 
long hallway without knowing 
why. 

He rushed across the lobby, 
gasping for breath. The message 
had said, Come. It’s time.

These endless facts about all 
Earthly knowledge. 

Earthly knowledge . 

As he came half tripping, half 
running down the building steps 
into the early darkness, he saw 
the flickering bluish-white light 
in the sky. It was aiming over 
the trees, the buildings, straight 
at him. 

He stood petrified, staring at it, 
and knew exactly why he had ac- 
quired all the knowledge he had. 

The blue-white light bore di- 
rectly at him with a piercing, 
whining hum. Across the dark 
campus, a young girl screamed. 

Life on the other planets, the 
last words crossed his mind, is 
not only possibility but high 
probability. 

Then the light hit him and 



bounced straight back up to its 
source, like lightning streaking 
in reverse from lightning rod to 
storm cloud, leaving him in aw- 
ful blackness.

FORECAST 

Most of our readers like serials— and we try to please them with some of the finest 
book-length novels science fiction has ever produced. But what about those who prefer com- 
plete stories? They deserve to be satisfied and so all the stories in next month's issue will 
be complete. 

Robert Sheckley leads off with a long, adventuresome, plot-twisty novelet that begins 
with A TICKET TO TRANAI— the utopia of the Galaxy— and ends with a transfer to just about 
the last place you would expect. Oh, it's a certified genuine utopia, all right, where all prob- 
lems have been solved. But the way they've been solved is— well, devastatingly logical! 

If you have never heard of a writer named Cordwainer Smith, make a deeply incised 
mental note of him now . after you've read his excitingly told novelet, THE GAME OF 
RAT AND DRAGON, you'll want to keep seeing him in print. Only partners can fight this 
deadliest of games— and the one way to dissolve the partnership is to be personally dissolved! 

There will be at least one other novelet, plus short stories and our regular features and 
departments, of course. Nice issue. Don't miss it, will you?

The Freelancer 



By ROBERT ZACKS 

Once these laws were passed, 
any time in history — however 
bad — were the good old days! 

Illustrated by ASHMAN 



J EB WAS shaken from his 
bed; his dream told him it 
was a glacier with wild 
winds howling laughter, and when 
he opened his eyes, shivering, he 
saw his wife, Laurie, had pulled 
the heat switch off. She stood 
there glaring. Today her hair was 
a lovely purple with a fashion- 
able streak of gold starting from 
the forehead, but it didn’t help 
the cold look on her face. 

“Get up, you bum,” she said in 
her sweet contralto. “Go out and 
earn some credits or I’ll certify 
you.” 

76 



The thought of being trans- 
ferred by the Economy Agent to 
Assigned Duty Status, with its 
virtual imprisonment to monoto- 
ny by the Welfare Office, made 
Jeb tumble from bed and fumble 
for his shoes. 

“My darling,” he said placat- 
ingly, “how beautiful you are this 
morning! How undeserving I am 
of you!” 

“You’re damn right about that,” 
said Laurie with bitterness. 
“When I think of the men I could 
have married, the wonderful life 
I might have lived, instead of 

gAlaxy science fiction 



scrimping along with a no-good 
freelance Monitor like you. .” 

“Sometimes I do pretty well. 
Three years ago, I sent you to the 
Pleasure Palace for a month, re- 
member?” 

“Three years ago. Big deal.” 

^!HE flounced out of the room. 
^ Sadly, Jeb went to the closet 
and examined the various uni- 
forms and disguises that were 
part of his equipment as a free- 
lance Monitor. As he selected the 
silver and black skintight suit of 
an Air Pollution Inspector, he 
wistfully remembered how nice 
it had been when Laurie had 
smiled at him. Immediately a 
flood of determination filled him 
to go out and do big things to- 
day. Maybe he would make a 
big strike and get a nice fat com- 
mission; then Laurie would . 

The televisor buzzed, flickered, 
and the genial face of the man 
from Marriage Relations ap- 
peared. 

“Good morning, Monitor Jeb,” 
said the man, smiling. “And how 
are things ’twixt you and your 
beloved?” 

“Rough,” moaned Jeb. “She’s 
really in a foul mood today.” 

The man from Marriage Rela- 
tions beamed. “Fine, fine, glad to 
hear it.” 

“Huh?” said Jeb. 

“Her Sadism Index Rating 
went up five points,” the man 



explained. “We wanted to make 
sure we hadn’t made an error. 
Well, that certainly is good news 
for you two. I’ll guess you’ll both 
be all right now.” 

“All right? Are you kidding?” 

“Now, now, we know what’s 
best for you. Your Masochism 
Rating is quite high, you know. 
Laurie is just what you need. 
Why, you two were made for 
each other.” 

Suddenly the man stopped 
talking, gasped, and the screen 
flickered and went dead. Jeb’s 
astonishment was wiped away by 
the soft, silvery bell tone of his 
portable Monitex, a flat two-by- 
six-inch machine resting on a 
shelf nearby. As Jeb wildly 
lunged toward it, he saw it was 
glowing red, activated by a viola- 
tion, and as he snatched it up, 
the coded reading dial had a noti- 
fication: Bx-P-203. 

Trembling, Jeb pressed a but- 
ton on the lower left of the Moni- 
tex and a voice promptly droned 
mechanically from the waferlike 
loudspeaker hidden under the 
surface, giving details of the vio- 
lation. 

“Bx-P-203 — At ten minutes 
after eight a.m., Monitex 27965 
of Freelance Monitor Jeb picked 
up violation of Copyright on the 
phrase ‘were made for each 
other.’ Said phrase property of

tion Picture Studios and Univer- 
sal Publications. Fee for use 80 
credits, commission fifty per 
cent.” 

T HE voice went dead and the 
flat metal surface glowed 
with letters strung into words 
reading “Please Collect and Re- 
mit Total Fee.” 

As Jeb uttered a yelp of de- 
light, Laurie came running into 
the room. 

“I heard the Monitex bell,” she 
said eagerly. 

“You sure did,” crowed Jeb. 
“Now aren’t you proud of me? 
I was smart enough to leave the 
Monitex on all night. We picked 
up a Verbal Copyright viola- 
tion . .” 

“You left it on all night?” 
screeched Laurie, her joy fading. 
“You imbecile, the leasing charge 
on the Monitex is ten credits an 
hour, isn’t it? What’s your com- 
mission on this violation?” 

“Forty credits. I — I guess I’m 
losing money, b-but . .” 

Laurie gave him her opinion 
of his supposed shrewdness. 

Jeb unhappily went to the tele- 
visor and punched out a call on 
the button keyboard which would 
recall the image of the Marriage 
Relations representative. He 
shrank back in alarm as the man’s 
glaring face appeared. 

“Sorry to hook you this way, 



old boy,” said Jeb meekly, “but 
it’s my job, you know. Got you 
on a Verbal for using ‘were made 
for each other.’ That phrase is 
owned by — ” 

“You dirty, sneaking spy!” 
yelled the man on the televisor 
screen. “I’ll bet your grandfather 
informed on diamond smugglers 
for a percentage.” 

“He . .” Jeb feebly started to 
protest. 

“It’s a hell of a thing,” raved 
the other, “when a man can’t even 
use words to express himself 
without paying . .” 

In alarm, Jeb leaned forward 
and hastily punched a combina- 
tion of buttons on the televisor. 
One half the screen blanked. The 
image of the Marriage Relations 
representative moved to the right 
and the lean, puritanical face of 
Jeb’s supervisor, Dirdon, flared 
onto the left half. 

Dirdon looked icily at Jeb. 
“What is it?” 

“Complaint on policy and pur- 
pose of Copyright Law,” said Jeb 
nervously. “Would you please 
handle it, sir? I’ll switch you.” 

A S DIRDON’S mouth pressed 
into a thin line and he 
nodded, Jeb flicked a switch. 
Both men on the screen immedi- 
ately turned profiles to Jeb and 
Laurie, seeing each other in then- 
own screens. 

“Did you have a complaint, 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sir?” asked Dirdon. 

“I don’t know who the devil 
you are,” shouted the man from 
Marriage Relations, “but I as- 
sume you’re one of those pirates 
cashing in on that copyright 
swindle. That new law has gone 
much too far. Copyrighting a 
work of skill, art, or expression 
is okay, I suppose, but to extend 
it to everyday speech, to verbal 
phrases — ” 

“Now just a minute,” said Dir- 
don briskly. “You buy greeting 
cards, I suppose, sir?” 

“So I buy greeting cards, so 
what?” 

“What are greeting cards exact- 
ly? Just a small square of paper 
with a few words, a very few 
words of sentiment on them. 
Words that any normal person 
certainly might be able to — ” 

“Any moron can write a better 
sentiment than those lousy cards 
express.” 

“But you buy them some- 
times?” 

“Well . sometimes.” 

“Why?” demanded Dirdon. 

“Saves me the bother of figur- 
ing out what to say, I guess,” 
was the growled answer. 

“Right. And you paid for these 
very few moronic phrases, paid 
good hard credits for them. Now 
isn’t it just as logical to protect 
owners of a phrase when some- 
body else uses it verbally?” 

“But,” said the man desperate- 



ly, “I didn’t want to violate the 
Copyright on Verbal Use. I didn’t 
know that phrase was under 
Copyright. Who can keep track 
of them all? Every day, more 
phrases and expressions are un- 
der Copyright as somebody else’s 
property. Why, first thing you 
know, there’ll hardly be any 
words left to say.” 

^np HAT ISN’T true,” objected 
J- Dirdon. “Copyright Law on 
Verbal Use is a great boon to 
society. Rule 7 for admission to 
protection requires that the 
phrase covered be one which may 
be considered ‘shopworn, over- 
used and so artistically tradition- 
al that it is a wearisome truism.’ 
That means that verbal medi- 
ocrity is heavily penalized, which 
is right and proper. Why, you 
ought to be ashamed to use a 
phrase like ‘were made for each 
other.’ It’s Monitors like Jeb who 
make you watch your words and 
think very carefully before you 
speak.” 

“Listen, stupid — ” 

“Already,” Dirdon plowed on, 
happily oratorical, “our citizens 
are being forced to express them- 
selves more richly, with initiative, 
casting off triteness!” 

The man from Marriage Rela- 
tions looked disgusted. “Ah,” he 
said angrily, “why don’t you drop 
dead.” 

Bong! 



THE FREELANCER

\*r ■ 




T HE man moaned as the Moni- 
tex Jeb held glowed red with 
another violation. Jeb grinned 
and pressed the loudspeaker but- 
ton. 

“Mz-R-14,” droned the voice. 
“At half-past eight, Monitex 
27965 of Freelance Monitor Jeb 
picked a violation of . .” 

The man covered his ears. 
After a few moments, he took his 
hands away and looked numbly 
from the screen as Dirdon 
smirked. 

“What’s the Copyright fee on 
that one?” he asked. 

“The use of the words ‘Drop 
Dead’ will cost you ten credits,” 
said Jeb. “We’ll bill you for both 
violations.” 

Dirdon was beaming as Jeb 
snapped the whole screen dark. 

With a start, Jeb remembered 
Laurie and turned to face her 
anger. “See, honeybunch?” he 
said hopefully. “Even if I did 
lose a few credits on the leasing 
charge by leaving the Monitex 
on all night, it looks like a lucky 
day. Why, I’ll bet I make enough 
commissions today to send you 
on a nice vacation.” 

Laurie gave him a narrow- 
eyed, cold stare. 

“You’d better,” she said. “Be- 
cause I’ve just about had enough 
of you. Either you make a big 
killing today or I certify you by 
midnight tonight. Do you hear 
me?” 



Jeb nodded in fright. He scut- 
tled out of the room, picking up 
a gravity harness from the stand 
in the foyer and not pausing to 
buckle himself into it until she 
slammed the door behind him. 

Sighing, Jeb got into the harn- 
ess and took off. He floated out 
the opening at the end of the 
corridor at the sixty-story level 
and joined the stream of com- 
muters at two thousand feet. 

As he set his speed at thirty 
miles an hour, he came abreast 
of a man wearing the solid gray 
uniform of an Unassigned Citi- 
zen. Jeb saw the look of misery 
on the man’s drawn face and felt 
so sympathetic, he didn’t even 
bother to hide his Monitex in its 
disguising parcel. You had to be 
pretty low to make your money 
out of a guy in that tough status. 
Hell, thought Jeb defiantly, let 
him see it and be warned; 1 don’t 
care. Even if the Inspector sees 
me. 

He noted the Unassigned Citi- 
zen staring down at the panorama 
of the vast city beneath them. At 
different lower levels, myriad 
flights of streaming citizens 
moved in various directions. The 
tremendous blocks of buildings 
had thin slits between them at 
the bottom of which were walks 
filled with antlike figures. 

“Ugly, huh?” said Jeb. 

He got a moody stare in return. 
“Believe it or not, I suddenly find

it beautiful. Compared to where 
I’m heading, anyway.” 

EB WAS shocked. “Oh?” 

“I’ve been certified,” said 
the man bluntly. “Not enough 
credits for support. I had to go 
to the Welfare Office and ask for 
assistance. Had my own gravity 
harness repair shop till a month 
ago. But the new ones are fool- 
proof, business fell off. Now I’m 
in for it.” 

“Gosh,” muttered Jeb, “that’s 
really tough. But what do you 
mean, ‘compared to where you’re 
heading?’ Sure, you’ll be assigned 
a dirty underground job, on the 
cables maybe, and the pay will 
be ridiculous, but it’ll be right 
here, won’t it?” 

“Haven’t you heard?” The 
other smiled grimly. “So many of 
us small business guys are being 
certified, the Welfare people had 
no more jobs. And you know the 
law. Indigents must be assigned 
to some duty. And it just hap- 
pens that they’re opening new 
mines on Mars and they can’t get 
help. I’ve no choice.” 

“Mines?” Jeb paled at the 
thought. “That Melbonite dust. 
One speck through the sealed-in 
suit and you’ve got a burn they 
still can’t heal.” He shuddered; 
then, seeing the face of the Un- 
assigned Citizen, he said sooth- 
ingly, “But those suits are fool- 
proof, I understand.” 

82 



“Not always,” said the man in 
gray. “Anyway, they haven’t 
licked the ventilation problem. 
The last suits they tried to air- 
condition, so much Melbonite 
dust filtered in . He took a 
deep breath of horror. “So the 
ones in use become awfully 
sweaty. I’m going to a living 
hell . .” 

Bong! 

Jeb’s Monitex glowed red with 
a violation. “Living Hell” was an 
old-fashioned dramatic phrase 
somebody sharp had dug up after 
diligent study and copyrighted in 
the hope of picking up a few 
credits. 

As Jeb numbly listened to the 
droning voice detail the facts and 
four credits charge, the man in 
the gray suit said mirthlessly, 
“Well, well, that’s just fine. 
Thanks a lot, my friend, for a 
nice sendoff.” 

Jeb snapped off the Monitex. 
“Look,” he said hurriedly, “that 
was an accident. This one is on 
me. Here.” He took four credit 
tokens from a pocket and thrust 
the silvery rectangles at the Un- 
assigned Citizen. “Put these aside 
until you’re billed for the viola- 
tion and pay it with my credits. 
Okay?” 

“Thanks,” said the man grate- 
fully. “I’ll remember you.” 

Jeb gave him a twisted grin. 
“You may not have to, pal. I may 
be right beside you in the next 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



shipment. My wife is ready to 
certify me for non-support. If I 
don’t clean up a nice fat com- 
mission by tonight, blooey, it’s 
the mines for me, too.” 

r r'HE Unassigned Citizen start- 
ed to form the words Good 
luck! when Jeb hastily inter- 
rupted, “That’s on Copyright. 
Take it easy.” 

“Uh . my heart goes beside 
yours,” said the man, choosing 
his words carefully. “My sym- 
pathy has arms, one of which is 
around your mighty shoulders. I 
say to you farewell.” 

“Wonderful!” exclaimed Jeb. 
He pumped the other’s hand. “I 
like the way you put that. It’s 
new. It has a freshness.” 

They smiled at each other. 
Then the oval building that 
housed The SuperMonitex Feed- 
er came into view and Jeb waved 
good-by and swung out of the 
commuter stream in the regula- 
tion spiral under the cold eyes of 
a golden-clad traffic cop. Jeb 
landed on the balcony ledge out- 
side the ninetieth-level corridor 
and walked in, finally entering a 
huge room in the center of which 
was a circular wall with plug 
outlets and sets of dials and 
screens at intervals all the way 
around. 

Jeb greeted a few of his co- 
workers, but didn’t pause to gos- 
sip. He wasn’t in a gay mood 



this morning, as were many of 
them who were gleefully recount- 
ing some of the slick violations 
they’d picked up. Jeb went to the 
circular wall and plugged his 
Monitex into a receptacle. He 
punched a button marked New 
Copyrights and waited for the 
humming to stop indicating that 
his Monitex had been fed all the 
latest phrases added to the huge 
group protected by law. 

With his Monitex coded up to 
date, its memory bank fattened, 
Jeb went to the supply room to 
requisition a hollowed-out air 
pollution meter to conceal his 
Monitex. A hand tapped his 
shoulder. 

“Hi, there,” said Monitor Platt, 
a lean-faced, smirking man Jeb 
disliked. “I just came off night 
shift. Had a big evening.” 

“Yeah?” asked Jeb, his skin 
crawling. Monitor Platt special- 
ized in copyright violations in 
the area of lakes and parks where 
lovers murmured words they soon 
found out were not at all new 
and quite expensive. 

Monitor Platt chuckled. “Been 
cleaning up on a new copyright 
just registered. The good old wolf 
whistle. One hundred credits fee.” 
Even Jeb was startled. “But 
that’s not a phrase.” 

“No, but it’s a ‘shopworn, over- 
used and wearisome truism,’ so 
they slipped it through.” 

“Golly, next thing you know, 



THE FREELANCER 



83 



they’ll be copyrighting a deep 
sigh or the smacking sound of a 
kiss.” 

T%/|" ONITOR Platt laughed in 
-L’ A appreciation. Then, as Jeb 
frowned and attended to fitting 
his detector into the shell of the 
air pollution meter, Monitor 
Platt regaled him with the viola- 
tions that had poured credits into 
his pockets. 

“Got a cute dame, nice curves, 
getting a good hugging under the 
moon near the lake. She says 
timidly to this sap, ‘It’s the first 
time I’ve ever been kissed, hon- 
estly.’ Bong! Fifty credits for the 
expense account. And another 
one I picked up in a canoe parked 
on the bank. This guy says soul- 
fully, ‘I’m not the marrying kind, 
but . .’ He never gets a chance 
to finish. Bong! Thirty credits. I 
sure cleaned up today. If I were 
you, I’d head straight for the 
snuggle spots. A whole raft of 
corny love lines have been blank- 
eted in, you know, and nobody’s 
alerted.” 

“Uh, well,” muttered Jeb, who 
didn’t want any enemies and so 
didn’t express his feelings about 
making a living from such a 
source, “I already have my 
schedule figured out, but I’ll keep 
it in mind.” 

“Where you headed for?” 

Monitor Jeb was relieved when 
the big bell sounded, its brassy 

84 



reverberations warning Monitors 
to quit gabbing and get out into 
the field to scoop up violations 
and revenue for the corporation. 
The paunchy office manager, 
seated up on a small balcony 
overlooking the giant hall, saw 
that the signal was, as usual, be- 
ing ignored. Indignantly he 
punched a button on the board 
facing him and a repulsive odor 
filled the air which had the Moni- 
tors hastily seizing their equip- 
ment and leaving the building. 

Jeb gladly took off into the 
windy canyons between the sky- 
scrapers. Instead of ascending, he 
plummeted down forty stories 
and drifted along, his nostrils 
twitching with the bad air at this 
height. Fleetingly, he had the 
grumbling thought that, with 
present-day technology, there 
was no excuse at all for polluted 
atmosphere. 

Oh, well, he thought, one of 
these days, somebody public- 
minded will do something about 
it. Right now, I’ve got to make 
enough to stop Laurie from certi- 
fying me. 

He felt a sudden chill as he 
recalled his wife’s threat. Quickly 
he sought out the first location 
he’d mapped out for some easy 
revenue, the personnel office of 
the Air Pollution Control Corp. 
Jeb switched off anti-gravity and 
heavily walked through the corri- 
dor, stepped inside the deep- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rugged, >gray and green office and 
joined the small nervous group 
of inspectors waiting for inter- 
views. 

J EB, in his air pollution uni- 
form, was as acceptable as a 
long-used piece of furniture. Un- 
noticed, he sat on one of the hard 
benches with the others. They 
stared and listened to the inter- 
view being conducted by the 
genial, balding man behind the 
open partition ten feet away. The 
air pollution inspector facing him 
was tense, pale and overanxious. 

“Yes, indeed, you do have a 
good record,” the personnel man 
was saying approvingly. “No ab- 
sences in five years, no latenesses. 
Very good indeed.” 

“Then,” said the air pollution 
inspector eagerly, “I’ll be up- 
graded? I’ll get that promotion 
promised two years ago?” 

The personnel man cleared his 
throat, but his smile remained 
radiant. “Just as soon as business 
picks up, we’ll give you a promo- 
tion and raise in pay . .” 

Bong! 

A roar of mirth arose from the 
waiting air pollution men as 
Monitor Jeb nervously pulled his 
Monitex from its concealing pol- 
lution meter shell and read the 
violation off to the enraged per- 
sonnel man. A fifty credit fee for 
use of the copyrighted verbal 
phrase Just as soon as business 



picks up, we’ll give you a promo- 
tion and raise in pay. 

As Jeb escaped the wrath of 
his victim, one of the men snick- 
ering nearby muttered, “Hah! 
He’ll have to rack his tiny brain 
for a new way of stalling us from 
now on.” 

In the next three hours, Jeb 
drove himself hard. He picked up 
a twenty credit fee when a door- 
man outside a Teletheatre had 
bonged the Monitex with “Plenty 
of seats inside!” He scooped up 
another violation in a bar when 
a bleary-eyed man with veins 
showing in his nose murmured to 
the bartender, “Well, I’ll have 
just one more.” He wandered to 
the telephone booths and waited 
for one of the standby violations 
to fall into his pocket; sure 
enough, a handsome, dark-eyed 
fellow murmured into the mouth- 
piece, “I’ll be working late to- 
night again, honey; sorry.” 

The time passed too swiftly 
and when Jeb paused to get a 
bite of food, he saw, dismayed, 
that even though he was having 
a pretty good day, it was far from 
the killing he’d promised Laurie. 
Ten and twenty credit violations 
didn’t make a man rich. 

What I need is one of the really 
big ones, thought Jeb desperately. 

With fumbling fingers, he 
pressed out a core number on the 
Monitex. 

It glowed blue. 



THE FREELANCER 



85 



The voice droned, “Informa- 
tion!” 

Jeb asked eagerly, “What have 
we got with fees of a thousand 
credits and higher?” 

A MOMENT hummed by. 
J -*- Then the voice announced 
that a large batch of political 
“corn” had been copyrighted in 
view of the current election cam- 
paign. Jeb listened with mount- 
ing excitement to some of them: 
If I am elected, taxes will be re- 
duced ... As I look upon the 
intelligent faces in my audience 
. I am reminded of a story . 
What a lovely child, Madam . 
A helicopter on every roof . 

Jeb shut it off, perspiration 
breaking out on his face. It was 
a uranium mine! Jeb’s mind 
reeled at the astonishing fee set 
for these copyright violations. A 
thousand credits per use. The 
party in power was really out to 
fight off the opposing Tradition- 
alist Party with every possible 
trick, with the result that Jeb 
could make the biggest cleanup 
of his life. 

That is, if he got away alive. 

Full of foreboding, Jeb floated 
up toward the meeting rooms of 
the local Traditionalist Head- 
quarters, which were on the fifti- 
eth level of a nearby skyscraper. 
His terrified adrenal glands 
kicked his heart into a frenzy. 
The boys who ran the local club 

86 



were no patsies. Many an argu- 
mentative citizen had been found 
floating in the rarified strato- 
sphere, frozen stiff, with his anti- 
gravity belt turned on full and 
his hands bound so he could not 
stop the upward climb. 

Monitor Jeb nervously drifted 
into the corridor opening and re- 
stored gravity. He sneaked past 
the open door, getting a quick 
glimpse of a hall filled with citi- 
zens listening to a red-faced, 
stoutish man on a platform. 

Jeb frantically searched for 
and, with throat-catching relief, 
found the back entrance to the 
big hall. It led to a dusty area of 
scaffolding and discarded, rust- 
ing tools. Now Jeb was crawling 
down an incline leading under 
the platform and found the small, 
railed-off area which once had 
housed a hidden prompter for 
musical entertainments. 

Panting, Jeb squatted in the 
dark, hearing the booming voice 
just above him, only slighty 
muffled. As Jeb shoved the Moni- 
tex up against the crack in the 
boards over him, the speaker’s 
voice came to him strongly, 
“Now, fellers, you’re all precinct 
captains and it’s a helluva empty 
title to have when your party is 
outa power. But if we get back 
on the gravy train — well, need 
I say more?” 

A muffled roar from the audi- 
ence made Jeb crouch worriedly. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Now we’re gonna take this 
election, see? I want all you loyal 
party workers . 

Bong! 

TTOWLS of rage shook the 
walls and reverberated 
through to Jeb as the political 
hacks recognized the sound and 
understood that somewhere a 
Monitex had automatically re- 
corded the voice vibration pat- 
tern of the speaker in a Verbal 
Copyright violation. 

“Kill the dirty spy!” screamed 
the speaker. 

Bong! went the Monitex. 

“Lynch him!” 

In three minutes of unguarded 
outrage, Jeb had recorded ten 
thousand credits in violations 
which the speakers never could 
escape because, like fingerprints, 
all voice patterns were registered 
by the government. 

Jeb turned to the exit behind 
him and crawled painfully for 
twenty feet, then got up and be- 
gan running. He ran straight into 
a brawny body at the turn of the 
corridor. The next thing he knew, 
he was on his back and ruthless 
hands were banging his head 
against the floor. 

The siren of a golden-clad 
policeman cut the air and magic- 
ally the hands fell away, leaving 
Jeb sprawling and groggy. 

After a moment, he was able 
to focus his eyes. The policeman 

I 

THE FREELANCER 



stared down at him, fists authori- 
tively on his hips. 

“Well, I came just in time, eh?” 
said the cop. “Saved your neck.” 
Bong! went the Monitex. 

Jeb said hastily, “It’s all right, 
Officer. It’s on the house.” 

“It had damn well better be,” 
growled the policeman. “If you 
know what’s good for you — 
Bong! went the Monitex. 

“Go on, get outa here before I 
run ya in,” yelled the officer. 
Bong! went the Monitex. 

^XTAVE a good time, dear,” 
Jeb called after Laurie as 
she happily took off into space 
from their level, clutching her 
purse, which was jammed with 
enough credits to keep her brim- 
ful of fun for two whole months 
at the Pleasure Palace. 

“Don’t you worry about that,” 
said Laurie over her shoulder. 

Jeb went back to his apart- 
ment. He stretched out on the 
couch, contentment welling up in 
him. He opened the footstool 
nearby and, within its archaic 
shape, slid open the cunningly 
concealed refrigerator. He took 
out a plastic cone of beer. 

“A-ah!” sighed Jeb. How won- 
derful to be alone, free of Laurie’s 
nagging for two whole months! 
A superb reward for his hard 
work. How clever of the govern- 
ment to have passed such a regu- 
lation! 

87 



After a while, like wax melt- 
ing, his grin drooped away. It 
certainly was quiet, wasn’t it? 

Within half an hour, he was 
wild and didn’t know why. Jit- 
tering, he dialed his televisor and 
the man from Marriage Rela- 
tions appeared on the screen. He 
glared at Jeb and cautiously 
looked around for the Monitex 
until he spotted it. 

“Shut that thing off or no ad- 
vice,” snapped the man. 

“It’s off! Look, I don’t know 
what’s bothering me. Can I have 
special permission to join my 
wife on her vacation? Or get her 
back here?” 

“Afraid not,” said the man. 
“The principle of working so 
one’s wife can have a vacation 
has been established through the 
centuries; the government mere- 
ly put it into law. And as for 
joining her or getting her back 
here — that’s against the law.” 
“But that’s unfair!” yelled Jeb. 
“Oh?” The man smiled. “So! 
I’m glad to see how happy, how 
perfect is the marriage we ar- 
ranged for you.” He rubbed his 
hands in delight. “She’s just bare- 
ly gone and already you miss 
her. Wonderful.” 

“Wonderful? I’m suffering!” 
The man from Marriage Rela- 
tions glanced at a dial nearby. 
“Of course you are. Suffering is 
the ideal joy for a Masochist. 
Just think what a lovely two 



months of missing her you’ll 
have.” 

“All right, so it’s a rule that I 
have to send her on a vacation 
and can’t join her,” Jeb com- 
plained savagely, “but, damn it, 
she doesn’t have to enjoy it!” 
“Well,” said the man, looking 
back to Jeb, “there’s the answer. 
Your Masochism index has gone 
down any number of points. 
You’re angry!” 

Jeb thought it over. “You bet 
I am! But what do I do about it?” 
“Why,” said the man from 
Marriage Relations, “the same 
thing husbands have been doing 
ever since they started working 
to send their wives away on vaca- 
tions. When the cat’s away, you 
know — ” He stopped in alarm. 

Jeb grinned. “I told you the 
Monitex is off. But thanks for 
the trite truism. She thinks she’s 
the only one who’ll have a vaca- 
tion, eh? I’ll show her!” 

“Service is our motto. And it 
really is,” the man said pugna- 
ciously. “We own the Copyright.” 
The face flickered off the 
screen and Jeb began poking 
around in innocent-looking secret 
places for a little black book he 
hadn’t thought of using in years. 

He was dismayed to find him- 
self singing “My wife’s gone to 
the country, hooray, hooray,” un- 
til he remembered that he actu- 
ally had shut off the Monitex.

¥>EFORE going into my regu- 
lar routine, I would like to 
poach on Editor Gold’s preserve 
and present you with a tiny short 
story sent me by 11-year-old 
Harold Zellner of Lake Worth, 
Florida. Personally, I think it’s a 
pretty smart little tale! It’s 
called: 

RYME OF GODS 
“The preacher stood up. He 
spoke, his robot body humming. 
His followers kneeled. ‘And now 
we read from the Book of Books, 
the Book of Truth, the Book of 
the Great God Man, creator of 
the Universe, who hath gone up 



to Heaven, long ago.’ 

“The church was large, and the 
preacher had to talk loudly to 
drown out the humming of the 
hundred of robot bodies. ‘And 
now we read from Psalm 17, the 
truth of truths.’ 

“The preacher flipped through 
the Book of Books, trying to find 
Psalm 17. Outside, wind blew 
over the rubble and the skeleton 
of broken cities. 

“The preacher finally found 
Psalm 17. He read aloud the 
truth of truths: 

“ ‘Mary had a little lamb, its

YOU SHALL KNOW THEM 
by Vercors. Pocket Books, 25c 

T AM OVER two years late 

with this one, but in view of 
its brilliance it is never too late 
to call it to your attention. The 
story is uniquely original, I be- 
lieve: an attempt on the part of 
men of good will to broaden the 
definition of “human being” by 
achieving interbreeding between 
Man and an almost extinct type 
of ape. 

The story itself is shocking 
and fascinating, and the moral 
and ethical implications tremen- 
dous. You’ll recognize the book 
on your newstand by the two 
words, printed in inch-and-a-half 
letters on the cover: read THIS. 
Them’s my sentiments, too. 

EXPLORATION OF THE 
MOON by R. A. Smith. Text by 
Arthur C. Clarke. Harper & Bros., 
$2.50 

R A. SMITH is a British artist 
• and rocket designer, and why 
we haven’t heard more of him 
before this, I don’t know. While 
his techniques are quite different 
from those of Bonestell, et al, his 
pictures — there are 45 magnifi- 

90 



cent plates in the book — are 
top grade. Furthermore, the 
whole future development of 
space flight from an instrument- 
carrying rocket in an orbit 
around Earth through the full 
development of the Moon to the 
preliminary exploration of Mars 
is presented in logical — and 
chronological — order. 

It’s a fascinatingly “factual” 
portrayal of our future in space 
and Arthur Clarke’s full and 
bright text captions add the real- 
ism of science to the imagination 
of art. 

THE OLD DIE RICH AND 
OTHER SCIENCE FICTION 
STORIES by H. L. Gold. Crown 
Publishers, $3.00 

TTERE’S A real must — Editor 
Gold’s first book of stories 
— twelve of them and every one 
a gem! 

A few (despite the title) are 
pure fantasies: “Trouble with 

Water,” for example, in which the 
fantasy aspect is made all the 
more appealing by the nature of 
its Arthur Kober-like characters 
and environment. 

Most of the tales, though, have 
that sensitive combination of 
imaginations that I like to call 
science fantasy — almost super- 
natural development combined 
with vividly alive and plausible 
motivation and shrewd scientific 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and societal extrapolation. 

Among my favorites in the 
book are “At the Post,” “Problem 
in Murder,” “The Old Die Rich,” 
“Love in the Dark” (delicious!) 
and “Trouble with Water;” but 
all, with one or two exceptions 
(which Aitchell himself points 
out in his novel and excellent 
working notes and analysis that 
accompany each story), are way 
up there at the top of the literary 
pile. 

It’s a genuinely distinguished 
collection. 

REBIRTH by John Wynd- 
ham. Ballantine Books, cloth 
$2.00, paper 35c 

HTHIS IS A fresh new version 
of the old plot about a post- 
atomic-war mutant society. It is 
so skillfully done that the fact 
that it’s not a shiny new idea 
makes absolutely no difference. 

I have put it on my shelf next 
to Padgett’s Mutant; and when 
you compare the two, I think you 
will agree that variety within 
existing frameworks is one of the 
truly healthy directions for sci- 
ence fiction to take. 

HELL’S PAVEMENT by 
Damon Knight. Lion Books, 25c 

T^OR A TENSE experience in 
•*- a mad and tragic world of 
tomorrow, I recommend this, 



Damon Knight’s first book. Sure, 
it’s confusing — his world of 
tomorrow is a crazy bouillabaisse 
of compulsive (or rather com- 
pelled) consumption in a series 
of mutually antagonistic societies. 
Sure, it’s sad, for it extrapolates 
only too realistically some of the 
modern trends. But it’s good 
withal. 

It is based on a story Knight 
wrote for Astounding in 1951, 
called “The Analogues.” Some of 
you may remember its showing 
how an invention that should 
have prevented crime, war and 
violence was turned to sinister 
uses by slick men of ill will. Well, 
this carries the idea to its ulti- 
mate conclusion — and it ain’t 
pretty. But it makes taut reading.

BEYOND EDEN by David 
Duncan. Ballantine Books, $2.00 
and 35c 

r I ’’HIS TALE is even better 
than Duncan’s first, Dark 
Dominion. In that one, the story 
was fine but the science bizarre, 
to say the least. Here the story 
is as good and the science re- 
markably convincing. 

The tale deals with an enor- 
mous atom-powered salt-water 
distillation plant in California, in 
which the end product is fresh 
water for irrigation and the by- 
products every element known 
to Man — including the uranium 
that runs the show. 

An unexpected by-product is 
a “substance” that stimulates life 
enormously and it is around this 
baffling phenomenon, plus the 
petty unwillingness of a certain 
Congressman to permit it to be 
used for Man’s benefit, that the 
plot revolves. The style is under- 
stated, the characters true, the 
“message” uncomfortably perti- 
nent to our times.

THE GALACTIC BREED by 

92 



Leigh Brackett (originally THE 
ST ARMEN). Ace Books, Inc., 
35c 

HP HE “NEW” novel in the lat- 
est Ace Double has all the 
clanking apparatus of the stories 
popular in the 1930s and a plot 
just about as dated. It deals with 
nasty alien invaders trying to 
keep Terrans from “The Space 
Sea;” with intelligent robots; 
with E. E. Smith-type mind 
powers; and with many other 
standard space opera concepts. 
And yet — the darn thing has 
vitality! 

Miss Brackett’s unnecessarily 
retitled tale is, as I said in my 
original review in 1953, a pleas- 
ant time-passer. 

TIMELINER by Charles Eric

where he started, but with all the 
excitement of suburban commut- 
ing. Lover kills wife’s husband 
by “speeding up” time machine; 
story ends when husband winds

By F. L. WALLACE 



Prophets aplenty foretold the 
end — but not one ever guessed 
just how it would come about! 



E VERY PAPER said so in 
all the languages there 
were, I guess. I kept read- 
ing them, but didn’t know what 
to believe. I know what I wanted 
to think, but that’s different from 
actually knowing. 

There was the usual news just 
after Labor Day. The Dodgers 
were winning or losing, I forget 
which, and UCLA was strong and 
was going to beat everybody they 
met that fall. An H-bomb had 



been tested in the Pacific, blow- 
ing another island off the map, 
just as if we had islands to spare. 
Ordinarily this was important, 
but now it wasn’t. They put stuff 
like this in the back pages and 
hardly anybody reads it. There 
was only one thing on the front 
pages and it was all people talked 
about. All I talked about, anyway. 

It began long before. I don’t 
know how long because they 
didn’t print that. But it began

and there it was, right upon us 
that day. It was Saturday. Big 
things always seem to happen on 
Saturdays. I ate breakfast and 
got out early. I had the usual 
things to do, mowing the lawn, 
for instance. I didn’t do it nor 
anything else and nobody said 
anything. There wasn’t any use 
in mowing the lawn on a day like 
that. 

I went out, remembering not 
to slam the door. It wasn’t much, 
but it showed thoughtfulness. I 
went past the church and looked 
at the sign that was set diagon- 
ally at the corner so that it could 
be read from both streets. There 
it was in big letters, quoting from 
the papers: THIS IS THE DAY 
THE WORLD ENDS! Some 
smart reporter had thought it up 
and it seemed so true that that 
was the only way it was ever 
said. Me? I didn’t know. 

TT WAS A bright day. People 

were out walking or just stand- 
ing and looking at the sky. It was 
too early to look up. I went on. 
Paul Eberhard was sitting on the 
lawn when I came along. He 
tossed me the football and I 
caught it and tried to spin it on 
my finger. It didn’t spin. It fell 
and flopped out with crazy 
bounces into the street. The milk 
truck stopped, while I got it out 
of the way. I tossed the football 
back to Paul. He put his hand 

94 



on it and sat there. 

“What’ll we do?” he said. 

I made a motion with my 
hands. “We can throw the ball 
around,” I said. 

“Naw,” he said. “Maybe you’ve 
got some comic books.” 

“You’ve seen them all,” I said. 
“You got some?” 

“I gave them to Howie,” he 
said, thoughtfully screwing the 
point of the ball into the center 
of a dandelion. “He said he was 
going to get some new ones 
though. Let’s go see.” He got up 
and tossed the ball toward the 
porch. It hit the railing and 
bounced back into the bushes. 
That’s where he usually kept it. 

“Paul,” called his mother as 
v/e started out. 

“Yeah?” 

“Don’t go far. I’ve got some 
things I want you to do.” 

“What?” he said patiently. 

“Hauling trash out of the base- 
ment. Helping me move some of 
the potted plants around in 
front.” 

“Sure,” he said. “I’ll be back.” 

We went past another church 
on the way to Howie’s. The sign 
was the same there. THIS IS 
THE DAY THE WORLD 
ENDS! They never said more 
than that. They wanted it to 
hang in our minds, something we 
couldn’t quite touch, but v/e knew 
was there. 

Paul jerked his head at the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sign. “What do you think of it?” 
“I don’t know.” I broke off a 
twig as we passed a tree. “What 
about you?” 

“We got it coming.” He looked 
at the sky. 

“Yeah, but will we get it?” 

He didn’t answer that. “I won- 
der if it will be bright?” 

“It is now.” 

“It might cloud over.” 

“It won’t matter. It’ll split the 
sky.” That was one thing sure. 
Clouds or anything weren’t going 
to stand in the way. 

We went on and found Howie. 
Howie is a Negro, smaller than 
we are and twice as fast. He can 
throw a football farther and 
straighter than anyone else on 
the team. We pal around quite a 
bit, especially in the football sea- 
son. 

He came out of the house like 
he was walking on whipped 
cream. I didn’t let that fool me. 
More than once I’ve tried to 
tackle him during a practice 
game. Howie was carrying a 
mode} of a rocket ship, CO^ pow- 
ered. It didn’t work. We said hi 
all around and then he suggested 
a game of keep-away. We’d left 
the football at Paul’s and we 
couldn’t so we walked over to 
the park. 

W E SAT DOWN and began 
talking about it. “I’m won- 
dering if it will really come,” said 

96 



Paul. We all squinted up. 

“Where’ll the President watch 
it from?” I said. “He should have 
a good view from the White 
House.” 

“No better than us right here,” 
said Howie. 

“What about Australia? Will 
they see it there?” I said. 

“They’ll see it all over.” 

“Africa, too? And what about 
the Eskimos?” 

“It doesn’t matter whether 
they actually see it or not. It will 
come to everyone at the same 
time.” 

I didn’t see how it could, but 
I didn’t feel like an argument. 
That’s what they were saying on 
TV and you can’t talk back to 
that. 

“Everybody,” said Howie. “Not 
just in this town, but all over. 
Wherever there are people. Even 
where they’re not.” 

“You read that,” said Paul. 

“Sure,” said Howie. “You lent 
me the comic books. It’s even in 
them.” 

We didn’t say much after that. 
I kept thinking of the man who 
made the H-bomb. I bet he felt 
silly and spiteful, blowing up an 
island. Somebody might have 
wanted to live on it, if he’d just 
left it there. He must have felt 
mean and low when something 
teally big like this came along. 

We talked on for a while, but 
we’d talked it out long ago. There 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was really nothing new we could 
say. Every so often we’d look up 
at the sky, but it wasn’t going to 
come until it got here. 

Finally we drifted apart. There 
wasn’t anything left to do. We 
walked home with Howie and 
then I went with Paul, leaving 
him to come back to my house. 
I looked at the lawn and without 
thinking about it got busy and 
mowed it. I surprised myself. 

It was hot, or it seemed to me 
it was. I went in to eat. Ma came 
by and shut off the sound of TV. 
I could still see the picture in the 
other room. The announcer was 
making faces, but, of course, I 
didn’t hear what he said. He 
looked pretty funny, I thought. I 
thought we were all probably 
pretty funny, moving our mouths 
and blinking our eyes and waving 
our hands. Only nothing real was 
coming out. Not yet, anyway. 

“Sit still,” said Ma. “It will 
happen without your help. It’s 
going to be all right.” 

“Think so?” I said. She would 
have told me anything to keep 
me quiet. She gets nervous when 
I fidget. 

“I think so,” she said, giving 
me my allowance. It was early 
for that. Usually I didn’t get it 
until after supper. “Why don’t 
you run uptown and watch it 
from there?” 

“Maybe I will,” I said, dab- 
bling my hands in the water at 



the sink. “Are you going to go?” 

“Of course I’m not. Why 
should I get into that mob? I can 
watch it just as well from here.” 

Sure she could. But it was not 
the same. Everybody I knew was 
going to be there. I changed shirts 
before I left. I took a rag and 
wiped the dust from my shoes. I 
wasn’t trying to be fussy or 
dressed up or anything. I just 
thought I should do it. 

r I ^ HERE was shade and sun on 
the streets and a few big 
clouds in the sky. 

A car slowed up and stopped 
beside me. The window rolled 
down and Jack Goodwin leaned 
toward me. “Going uptown?” 

“Yeah.” 

“Want a lift?” 

“Sure.” Actually I didn’t. I’d 
rather have walked, looking 
around as I went. 

Jack Goodwin grinned as I got 
in. He’s got gray hair, where he 
has hair. The rest is bald. He 
looked me over. “I don’t see any 
comets on your shoulders,” he 
said gravely. 

“I never had any,” I said. Some 
people seem to think everyone 
under seventeen is a kid. 

“You’ll be needing them,” he 
said. 

“Maybe,” I said. I ought to 
have walked. 

I never knew how slow a day 
could pass. I suppose I should

have slept late and kept busy 
doing something. This was worse 
than putting on a uniform and 
waiting until gametime. At least 
there was a coach on the field to 
tell you what to do as you ran 
through the drill. 

Jack Goodwin stopped at a 
light. I had a notion to get out. 
But I didn’t. Goodwin grinned 
again as the light changed and 
we started up. “I don’t blame you 
for being edgy,” he said. “It’s the 
suspense. If we only had some 
way of knowing for sure, radio 
maybe.” 

“There’s no radio,” I said. “The 
calculations have been checked.” 

“Sure, but maybe there’s some- 
thing we forgot. Or don’t know. 
All sorts of things can go wrong.” 

He must have talked on and 
on, but I didn’t listen. Howie and 
me and Paul had gone over 
everything he was saying. 

“Thanks,” I said as he stopped 
and I got out. 

“Don’t mention it,” he said. He 
nearly scraped the rear fender of 
the car as he drove off. It was a 
new car, too. He wasn’t so bad. 
Maybe he was just worried. 

I wandered to the newsstand 
and looked at magazines and 
pocketbooks. Old lady Simpson 
didn’t ask me if I was going to 
buy and didn’t chase me away. 
She was busy arguing with some 
customers. Even so it was the 
first time she didn’t pay atten- 

98 



tion to me when I came in. I 
had a good chance to look at 
things I never buy. There was 
nothing in them I wanted to see. 
I was thirsty. I had a coke and 
was still thirsty. I asked for a 
glass of water, drank half of it 
and went out. 

OWN THE street there was 
a TV set in a store window. 
I watched it. They were showing 
a street in India, people looking 
up. They flashed all around, to 
Italy, China, Brazil. Except for 
their clothes, it wasn’t much dif- 
ferent from here. They were all 
looking up. 

I did the same. For the first 
time I noticed there was a slight 
overcast. Big billowing clouds 
had passed, but this was worse. 
I hoped it would clear away in 
time. Not that it really mattered. 

It was more crowded than 
usual for Saturday, but at the 
same time it was quiet. People 
were shopping, but they weren’t 
really buying much or else they 
bought it faster. Nobody wanted 
to miss it. They all seemed to 
have one eye on their lists and 
another on the clock. 

Howie and Paul came up the 
street and we nodded and said 
something. A few other boys from 
the school passed by and we 
stopped. We gathered together. It 
was getting closer — and the 
space between the minutes was 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



growing longer and longer. 

I looked at Paul’s watch. He 
said it was on the minute. I de- 
cided there was time to go in 
and get a candy bar. All of a 
sudden I was hungry. I didn’t 
know where it came from. I’d had 
to stuff down lunch not long ago. 
And now I was hungry. 

I went to a store and had to 
fight my way in. People were 
coming out. Not just customers, 
but the clerks and owner, too. 
There was a big television screen 
inside, but nobody wanted to see 
it on that. They wanted to be 
outside where it would happen 
to them. Not just see it, have it 
happen. The store was empty. 
Not closed — empty. 

I turned and rushed out to 
join the others. I couldn’t miss 
it. There were still minutes to 
go, but suppose there had been 
a miscalculation. I knew what 
that would mean, but even so I 
had to be there. I would almost 
die, too. 

Now we were all looking up 
— all over the world people 
were, I suppose. It was quiet. 
You could hear them breathing. 

And then it came, a flash across 
the sky, a silver streak, the big- 
gest vapor trail there ever was. 
It went from this side to that 
side in no time. It split the sky 
and was gone before the shock 
blast hit us. Nobody said any- 
thing. We stood there and shiv- 



ered and straightened up after 
the rumbling sound passed. 

But there was the vapor trail 
that stretched farther than any- 
one could see. It would go around 
the world at least once before it 
came to an end somewhere in 
the desert. I saw my science 
teacher — he was trying to smile, 
but couldn’t. And then there was 
the pharmacist who had wanted 
to be a research chemist, but 
wasn’t good enough. 

In front of me, old Fred Butler 
who drives the bus to Orange 
Point and King City cracked his 
knuckles. “He did it,” he whis- 
pered. “All the way to Mars and 
back. Safe and right on schedule.” 
He jumped up in the air and 
kept jumping up. He hadn’t been 
that high off the ground in sev- 
eral years. He never would be 
again unless he took an elevator. 
And I knew he hated elevators. 

Factory whistles started blow- 
ing. They sounded louder than 
Gabriel. I wonder if he heard 
them. I grabbed hold of the near- 
est person and started hugging. 
I didn’t know it was the snooty 
girl from the next block until she 
hugged back and began kissing 
me. We yelled louder than the 
factory whistles. We had a right. 

It was just like the papers 
said: This was the day the world 
ended — 

And the Universe began.

enemies. It all began when I was 
transferred to war-racked Naples 
and met a girl named — 

Rena dell’ Angel a, who, with 
her father Benedetto and another 
outcast named Slovetski, leads a 
subversive underground move- 
ment which works against the 
Company. They plot to destroy 
it; but the Company has perhaps 
an even more dangerous oppo- 
nent in the person of a strange 
man named — 

Zorchi, who makes his career 
of collecting on accident claims 
from the Company. There is no 
fraud involved; when he collects 
for the loss of a limb, the limb 
is indeed lost — but Zorchi, mys- 
teriously, can regrow a severed 
member like a starfish! Both 
Zorchi and Rena’s father are 
committed to — 

The Clinics, the Compa- 
ny’s suspended-animation vaults 
where, so says the Company, 
persons suffering from incurable 
diseases can tenderly be laid 
away until medical science can 
devise a cure. But Rena con- 
vinces me that the Company’s 
statement is a lie; together, we 
rescue Zorchi and her father and 
flee. 

Underwriter Defoe, a high 
executive of the Company, is our 
implacable enemy — and yet he 
was once my friend. But I be- 
lieve that it is he who has per- 
verted the all-good Company into 

102 



a cynical and corrupt power 
combine — certainly Millen Car- 
mody, his superior, is an honest 
man! Yet Defoe seems not to be 
under Carmody’s control. I am 
swept under by these conflicting 
currents, but one thing emerges: 
Something must be done! For 
the underground has managed to 
get a cobalt-bomb which can 
depopulate the entire world! 

R:g’t or wrong, I had no 
choice. I could not stand by and 
see the world destroyed for the 
sake of destroying the Company, 
however corrupt. I turned full 
circle; 1 betrayed the plans of 
the underground to Defoe — 

In vain. The C-bomb went off; 
the end of the world was at hand. 

XIV 

nr HE HOTEL was not safe, of 
course, but what place was 
when the world was at an end? 
Rena and I, between us, got her 
father, Benedetto, upstairs into 
her room without attracting too 
much attention. We put him on 
the bed and peeled back his 
jacket. 

The bullet had gone into his 
shoulder, a few inches above the 
heart. The bone was splintered, 
but the bleeding was not too 
much. Rena did what she could 
and, for the first time in what 
seemed like years, we had a 
moment’s breathing space. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I said, “I’ll phone for a doctor.” 
Benedetto said faintly, “No, 
Thomas! The Company!” 

I protested, “What’s the differ- 
ence? We’re all dead, now. You’ve 
seen — ” I hesitated and changed 
it. “Slovetski has seen to that. 
There was cobalt in that bomb.” 
He peered curiously at me. 
“Slovetski? Did you suppose it 
was Slovetski who planned it so?” 
He shook his head — and winced 
at the pain. He whispered, 
“Thomas, you do not understand. 
It was my project, not Slovetski’s. 
That one, he proposed to destroy 
the Company’s Home Office; it 
was his thought that killing them 
would bring an end to evil. I 
persuaded him there was no need 
to kill — only to gamble.” 

I stared at him. “You’re deliri- 
ous!” 

“Oh, no.” He shook his head 
and succeeded in a tiny smile. 
“Do you not see it, Thomas? The 
great explosion goes off, the world 
is showered with particles of 
death. And then — what then?” 
“We die!” 

“Die? No! Have you forgotten 
the vaults of the clinics?” 

It staggered me. I’d been re- 
citing all the pat phrases from 
early schooling about the bomb! 
If it had gone off in the Short 
War, of course, it would have 
ended the human race! But I’d 
been a fool. 

The vaults had been built to 



handle the extreme emergencies 
that couldn’t be foreseen — even 
one that knocked out nearly the 
whole race. They hadn’t expected 
that a cobalt-cased bomb would 
ever be used. Only the conspira- 
tors would have tried, and how 
could they get fissionables? But 
they were ready for even that. 
I’d been expecting universal 
doom. 

“The clinics,” Benedetto re- 
peated as I stared at him. 

TT WAS THE answer. Even 

radio-poisons of cobalt do not 
live forever. Five years, and near- 
ly half of them would be gone; 
eleven years, and more than 
three-quarters would be dissipat- 
ed. In fifty years, the residual 
activity would be down to a frac- 
tion of one per cent — and the 
human race could come back to 
the surface. 

“But why?” I demanded. “Sup- 
pose the Company can handle the 
population of the whole world? 
Granted, they’ve space enough 
and one year is the same as fifty 
when you’re on ice. But what’s 
the use?” 

He smiled faintly. “Bank- 
ruptcy, Thomas,” he whispered. 
“So you see, we do not wish to 
fall into the Company’s hands 
right now. For there is a chance 
that we will live . and perhaps 
the very faintest of chances that 
we will win!” 



PREFERRED RISK 



103 



T T WASN’T even a faint chance 
— I kept telling myself that. 

But, if anything could hurt the 
Company, the area in which it 
was vulnerable was money. Bene- 
detto had been intelligent in that. 
Bombing the Home Office would 
have been an inconvenience, no 
more. But to disrupt the world’s 
work with a fifty-year hiatus, 
while the air purged itself of the 
radioactive cobalt from the bomb, 
would mean fifty years while the 
Company lay dormant; fifty years 
while the policies ran their course 
and became due. 

For that was the wonder of 
Benedetto’s scheme: The Com- 
pany insured against everything. 
If a man were to be exposed to 
radiation and needed to be put 
away, he automatically went on 
“disability” benefits, while his 
policy paid its own premiums! 

Multiply this single man by 
nearly four billion. The sum came 
out to a bankrupt Company. 

It seemed a thin thread with 
which to strangle a monster. And 
yet, I thought of the picture of 
Millen Carmody in my Adjuster’s 
Manual. There was the embodi- 
ment of honor. Where a Defoe 
might cut through the legalities 
and flout the letter of the agree- 
ments, Carmody would be bound 
by his given word. The question, 
then, was whether Defoe would 
dare to act against Carmody. 

Everything else made sense. 



Even exploding the bomb high 
over the Atlantic: It would be 
days before the first fall-out came 
wind-borne to the land, and in 
those days there would be time 
for the beginnings of the mass 
migration to the vaults. 

Wait and see, I told myself. 
Wait and see. It was flimsy, but 
it was hope, and I had thought 
all hope was dead. 

We could not stay in the hotel, 
and there was only one place for 
us to go. Slovetski captured, the 
Company after our scalps, the 
whole world about to be plunged 
into confusion — we had to get 
out of sight. 

TT TOOK TIME. Zorchi’s hos- 

pital gave me a clue; I tracked 
it down and located the secre- 
tary. 

The secretary spat at me 
over the phone and hung up, but 
the second time I called him he 
grudgingly consented to give me 
another number to call. The new 
number was Zorchi’s lawyer. The 
lawyer was opaque and uncom- 
municative, but proposed that I 
call him back in a quarter of an 
hour. In a quarter of an hour, I 
was on the phone. He said guard- 
edly: “What was left in Bay 

100 ?” 

“A hypodermic and a bottle of 
fluid,” I said promptly. 

“That checks,” he confirmed, 
and gave me a number. 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



And on the other end of that 
number I reached Zorchi. 

“The junior assassin,” he 
sneered. “And calling for help? 
How is that possible, Weels? Did 
my avocatto lie?” 

I said stiffly, “If you don’t 
want to help me, say so.” 

“Oh — ” he shrugged. “I have 
not said that. What do you 
want?” 

“Food, a doctor, and a place 
for three of us to hide for a 
while.” 

He pursed his lips. “To hide, 
is it?” He frowned. “That is very 
grave, Weels. Why should I hide 
you from what is undoubtedly 
your just punishment?” 

“Because,” I said steadily, “I 
have a telephone number. Which 
can be traced. Defoe doesn’t 
know you’ve escaped, but that 
can be fixed!” 

He laughed angrily. “Oh-ho. 
The assassin turns to blackmail, 
is that it?” 

I said furiously, “Damn you, 
Zorchi, you know I won’t turn 
you in. I only point out that I 
can — and that I will not. Now, 
will you help us or not?” 

He said mildly, “Oh, of course. 
I only wished you to say ‘please’ 
— but it is not a trick you Com- 
pany men are good at. Signore, 
believe me, I perish with loneli- 
ness for you and your two friends, 
whoever they may be. Listen to 
me, now.” He gave me an address 



and directions for finding it. And 
he hung up. 

Zorchi’s house was far outside 
the city, along the road to New 
Caserta. It lay at the bend of the 
main highway, and I suppose I 
could have passed it a hundred 
thousand times without looking 
inside, it was so clearly the white- 
stuccoed, large but crumbling 
home of a mildly prosperous 
peasant. It was large enough to 
have a central court partly con- 
cealed from the road. 

The secretary, spectacles and 
all, met us at the door — and 
that was a shock. “You must have 
roller skates,” I told him. 

He shrugged. “My employer is 
too forgiving,” he said, with ice 
on his voice. “I had hoped to 
reach him before he made an 
error. As you see, I was too late.” 
We lifted Benedetto off the 
seat; he was just barely conscious 
by now, and his face was ivory 
under the Mediterranean tan. I 
shook the secretary off and held 
Benedetto carefully in my arms 
as Rena held the door before me. 

The secretary said, “A moment. 
I presume the car is stolen. You 
must dispose of it at once.” 

I snarled over my shoulder, “It 
isn’t stolen, but the people that 
own it will be looking for it all 
right. You get rid of it.” 

He spluttered and squirmed, 
but I saw him climbing into the 
seat as I went inside. Zorchi was 



PREFERRED RISK 



105 



there waiting, in a fancy motor- 
ized wheelchair. He had legs! 
Apparently they were not fully 
developed as yet, but in the short 
few days since I had rescued 
him something had grown that 
looked like nearly normal limbs. 
He had also grown, in that short 
time, a heavy beard. 

The sneer, however, was the 
same. 

I made the error of saying, 
“Signore Zorchi, will you call a 
doctor for this man?” 

The thick lips writhed under 
the beard. “Signore it is now, is 
it? No longer the freak Zorchi, 
the case Zorchi, the half-man? 
God works many miracles, Weels. 
See the greatest of them all — 
it has transmuted the dog into a 
signore!” 

I grated, “For God’s sake, 
Zorchi, call a doctor!” 

He said coldly, “You men- 
tioned this over the phone, did 
you not? If you would merely 
walk on instead of bickering, you 
would find the doctor already 
here.” 

T3LASMA and antibiotics: They 
flowed into Benedetto from 
half a dozen plastic tubes like 
oil into the hold of a tanker. And 
I could see, in the moments when 
I watched, the color come back 
into his face, and the sunken eyes 
seem to come back to life. 

The doctor gave him a sedative

that made him sleep, and ex- 
plained to us that Benedetto was 
an old man for such goings-on. 
But if he could be kept still for 
three or four weeks, the doctor 
said, counting the lire Zorchi’s 
secretary paid him, there was no 
great danger. 

If he could be kept still for 
three or four weeks. In scarcely 
ten days, the atmosphere of the 
planet would be death to breathe! 
Many things might happen to 
Benedetto in that time, but re- 
maining still was not one of them. 

Zorchi retired to his own quar- 
ters, once the doctor was gone, 
and Rena and I left Benedetto to 
sleep. 

We found a television set and 
turned it on, listening for word 
of the cobalt-bomb. We got re- 
corded canzoni sung by a reedy 
tenor. We dialed, and found the 
Neapolitan equivalent of a soap 
opera, complete with the wise, 
fat old mother and the sobbing 
new daughter-in-law. It was like 
that on all the stations, while 
Rena and I stared at each other 
in disbelief. 

Finally, at the regular hourly 
newscast, we got a flicker: “An 
unidentified explosion,” the an- 
nouncer was saying, “far out at 
sea, caused alarm to many per- 
sons last night. Although the ori- 
gins are not known, it is thought 
that there is no danger. However, 
there has been temporary dis- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



turbance to all long-lines com- 
munications, and air travel is 
grounded while the explosion is 
being investigated.” 

We switched to the radio: it 
was true. Only the UHF televi- 
sion bands were on the air. 

I said, “I can’t figure that. If 
there’s enough disturbance to 
ruin long-distance transmission, it 
ought to show up on the televi- 
sion.” 

Rena said doubtfully, “I do 
not remember for sure, Tom, but 
is there not something about tele- 
vision which limits its distance?” 
“Well — I suppose so, yes. It’s 
a line of sight transmission, on 
these frequencies at any rate. I 
don’t suppose it has to be, except 
that all the television bands fall 
in VHF or UHF channels.” 

“Yes. And then, is it not possi- 
ble that only the distance trans- 
mission is interrupted? On pur- 
pose, I mean?” 

I slammed my hand on the 
arm of the chair. “On purpose! 
The Company — they are trying 
to keep this thing localized. But 
the idiots, don’t they know that’s 
impossible? Does Defoe think he 
can let the world burn up with- 
out doing anything to stop it — 
just by keeping the people from 
knowing what happened?” 

She shrugged. “I don’t know, 
Tom.” 

I didn’t know either, but I sus- 
pected — and so did she. It was 



out of the question that the Com- 
pany, with its infinite resources, 
its nerve-fibers running into every 
part of the world, should not 
know just what that bomb was, 
and what it would do. And what 
few days the world had — be- 
fore the fall-out became danger- 
ous — were none too many. 

Already the word should have 
been spread, and the first groups 
alerted for movement into the 
vaults, to wait out the day when 
the air would be pure again. If 
it was being delayed, there could 
be no good reason for it. 

T HE ONLY reason was Defoe. 

But what, I asked myself 
miserably, was Millen Carmody 
doing all this while? Was he 
going to sit back and placidly 
permit Defoe to pervert every 
ideal of the Company? 

I could not believe it. It was 
not possible that the man who 
had written the inspiring words 
in the Handbook could be guilty 
of genocide. 

Rena excused herself to look 
in on her father. Almost ashamed 
of myself, I took the battered 
book from my pocket and opened 
it to check on Millen Carmody’s 
own preface. 

It was hard to reconcile the 
immensely reassuring words with 
what I had seen. And, as I read 
them, I no longer felt safe and 
comforted.

'I* HERE seemed to be no im- 
mediate danger, and Rena 
needed to get out of that house. 
There was nothing for Benedetto 
to do but wait, and Zorchi’s ser- 
vants could help him when it 
was necessary. 

I took her by the arm and we 
strolled out into the garden, 
breathing deeply. That was a mis- 
take. I had forgotten, in the in- 
conspicuous air conditioning of 
Zorchi’s home, that we were in 
the center of the hemp fields 
that had nearly cost me my din- 
ner, so long ago, with Hammond. 
I wondered if I ever would know 
just why Hammond was killed. 
Playing both ends against the 
middle, it seemed — he had un- 
doubtedly been in with Slovet- 
ski’s group. Rena had admitted 
as much, and I was privately 
certain that he had been killed 
by them. 

But of more importance was 
the stench in our nostrils. “Per- 
haps,” said Rena, “across the 
road, in the walnut grove, it will 
not be as bad.” 

I hesitated, but it felt safe in 
the warm Italian night, and so 
we tried it. The sharp scent of 
the walnut trees helped a little; 
what helped even more was that 
the turbinates of the nostril can 
stand just so much, and when 
their tolerance is exceeded they 
surrender. So that it wasn’t too 
long before, though the stench 

108 



was as strong as ever, we hardly 
noticed it. 

We sat against the thick trunk 
of a tree, and Rena’s head fitted 
naturally against my shoulder. 
She was silent for a time, and so 
was I — it seemed good to have 
silence, after violent struggle and 
death. 

Then she said: “Strange man.” 

“Me?” 

“No. Oh, yes, Tom, if it comes 
to that, you, too. But I was think- 
ing just now of Zorchi. Is it true, 
what you told me of his growing 
legs and arms so freely?” 

“I thought everyone in Naples 
knew that. I thought he was a 
national hero.” 

“Of course, but I have never 
really known that the stories were 
true. How does it happen, Tom?” 

I shrugged. “Heaven knows, I 
don’t. I doubt if even Zorchi 
knows. His parents might have 
been involved in some sort of 
atomic business and got radiated, 
and so they produced a mutation. 
It’s perfectly possible, you know.” 

“I have heard so, Tom.” 

“Or else it just happened. 
Something in his diet, in the way 
his glands responded to a sick- 
ness, some sort of medicine. No 
one knows.” 

“Cannot scientists hope to 
tell?” 

“Well — ” it was beginning to 
sound like the seeds of one of 
our old arguments — “well, I

me; she merely burrowed into my 
arm. 

Perhaps the wind shifted, and 
the smell of the hemp fields grew 
stronger; perhaps it was only the 
foul thought that the glaring sky 
had triggered that contaminated 
my mood. But where I had been 
happy and relaxed — the C- 
bomb completely out of my mind 
for the moment — now I was 
too fully aware of what was ahead 
for all of us. 

“Let’s go back, Rena,” I said. 
She didn’t ask why. Perhaps she, 
too, was feeling the weight of our 
death sentence. 

W E CAUGHT the evening 
newscast; its story varied 
little from the early ones. 

Benedetto still slept, but 
Zorchi joined us as we watched 
it. 

The announcer, face stamped 
with the careful blend of gravity 
and confidence that marks tele- 
casters all over the world, was 
saying: “Late word on the bomb 
exploded over the North Atlantic 
indicates that there is some dan- 
ger that radioactive ash may be 
carried to this area. The danger 
zones are now being mapped and 
surveyed, and residents of all 
such sections will be evacuated 
or placed in deep sleep until the 
danger is over. 

“Blue Bolt policies give you 
complete protection against all 

no 



hazards from this explosion. I re- 
peat, Blue Bolt policies give you 
complete protection against all 
hazards from this explosion. 
Check your policies and be sure 
of your status. There.is absolutely 
no risk for any person carrying 
the basic Blue Bolt minimum 
coverage or better.” 

I clicked off the set. “I wonder 
what the people in Shanghai are 
hearing tonight,” I said. 

Zorchi had only listened with- 
out comment, when I told him 
about the bomb that afternoon; 
he listened without comment 
now. 

Rena said: “Tom, I’ve been 
wondering. You know, I — I 
don’t have any insurance. Neither 
has my father, since we were 
canceled. And we’re not the only 
ones without it, either.” 

I patted her hand. “We’ll 
straighten this out,” I promised. 
“You’ll get your coverage back.” 

She gave me a skeptical look, 
but shook her head. “I don’t mean 
just about father and me. What 
about all of the uninsurables, all 
over the world? The bomb goes 
off, and everybody with a policy 
files down into the vaults, but 
what about the others?” 

I explained, “There are provi- 
sions for them. Some of them can 
be cared for under the depend- 
ency-clauses in the policies of 
their next of kin. Others have 
various charitable arrangements 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



— some localities, for instance, 
carry blanket floater policies for 
their paupers and prisoners and 
so on. And — well, I don’t sup- 
pose it would ever come to that, 
but if someone turned up who 
had no coverage at all, he could 
be cared for out of the loss-pool 
that the Company carries for 
such contingencies. It wouldn’t be 
luxurious, but he’d live. 

f ?A7" OU SEE,” I went on, warm- 
ing to my subject, “the 
Company is set up so the actual 
premiums paid are meaningless. 
The whole objective of the Com- 
pany is service; the premiums 
are only a way to that goal. The 
Company has no interest other 
than the good of the world, 
and — ” 

I stopped, feeling like a fool. 
Zorchi was laughing raucously. 

I said resentfully, “I guess I 
asked for that, Zorchi. Well, per- 
haps what I said sounds funny. 
But, before God, Zorchi, that’s the 
way the Company is set up. Here 
— ” I picked the Handbook from 
the end-table beside me and 
tossed it to him — “read what 
Millen Carmody says. I won’t try 
to convince you. Just read it.” 

He caught it expertly and 
dropped it on the floor before 
him. “So much for your Chief 
Assassin,” he remarked pleasant- 
ly. “The words are no doubt hon- 
ied, Weels, but I am not at this 



moment interested to read them.” 
I shrugged. It was peculiar 
how even a reasonable man — I 
have always thought of myself 
as a reasonable man — could 
make a fool of himself. It was no 
sin that habit had betrayed me 
into exalting the Company; but 
it was, at the least, quite silly of 
me to take offense when my audi- 
ence disagreed with me. 

I said, in what must have been 
a surly tone, “I don’t suppose you 
are — why should you? You 
hate the Company from the word 
go.” 

He shook his head mildly. “I? 
No, Weels. Believe me, I am the 
Company’s most devoted friend. 
Without it, how would I feed my 
five-times-a-day appetite?” 

I sneered at him. “If you’re a 
friend to the Company, then my 
best buddy is a tapeworm.” 

“Meaning that Zorchi is a para- 
site?” His eyes were furious. 
“Weels, you impose on me too 
far! Be careful! Is it the act of a 
tapeworm that I bleed and die, 
over and over? Is it something I 
chose, did I pray to the saints, 
before my mother spawned me, 
that I should be born a monster? 
No, Weels! We are alike, you 
gentlemen of the Company and I 
— we live on blood money, it is 
true. But the blood I live on, 
man — it is my own!” 

I said mollifyingly, “Zorchi, 
I’ve had a hard day. I didn’t mean 



PREFERRED RISK 



111 



to be nasty. I apologize.” 

“Hah!” 

“No, really.” 

H E SHRUGGED, abruptly 
quiet. “It is of no import- 
ance,” he said. “If I wished to 
bear you a grudge, Weels, I 
would have more than that to 
give me cause.” He sighed. “It 
all looked quite simple twenty- 
four hours ago, Weels. True, I 
had worked my little profession 
in this area as far as it might go 
— with your help, of course. But 
the world was before me — I 
had arranged to fly next week to 
the Parisian Anarch, to change 
my name and, perhaps within a 
month, with a new policy, suffer 
a severe accident that would pro- 
vide me with francs for my hob- 
bies. Why is it that you bring 
bad news always?” 

I said, “Wasn’t I of some little 
assistance to you at one time?” 
“In helping me from the deep- 
freeze? Oh, yes, perhaps. But 
didn’t you help me into it in the 
first place, as well? And surely 
you have already had sufficient 
credit for aiding my escape — I 
observe the young lady looking 
at you with the eyes of one who 
sees a hero.” 

I said in irritation, “You’re in- 
furiating, Zorchi. I suppose you 
know that. I never claimed any 
credit for helping you out of the 
clinic. As a matter of fact, I don’t 



think I ever mentioned it. Every- 
one assumed that I had just hap- 
pened to bring you along — no 
one questioned it.” 

He flared, rt You let them as- 
sume, Weels? You let them as- 
sume that Zorchi was as helpless 
a side of pork as those other 
dead ones — you let them guess 
that you stuck me with a needle, 
so that it would seem how brave 
you were? Is it not true that I 
had revived by myself, Weels?” 
I felt myself growing angry. 
“Of course! But I just didn’t see 
any reason to — ” 

“To divide the credit, is that 
it, Weels? No, say no more; I 
have closed the subject. However, 
I point out that there is a differ- 
ence between the rescue of a 
helpless hulk and the mere casual 
assistance one may be invited to 
give to a Zorchi.” 

I let it go at that. There was 
no point in arguing with that 
man, ever. 

So I left the room — ostensi- 
bly to look in on Benedetto, actu- 
ally to cool off a little. Benedetto 
seemed fine — that is, the dress- 
ings were still in place, he had 
not moved, his breath and pulse 
were slow and regular. I took my 
time before I went back to the 
room where Zorchi still sat 
waiting. 

He had taken advantage of the 
time to improve his mind. The 
man’s curiosity was insatiable; 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the more he denied it, the more 
it stuck out all over him. He had 
thrown the Handbook on the 
floor when I gave it to him, but 
as soon as I was out of sight he 
was leafing through it. He had 
it open on his lap, face down, as 
he faced me. 

“Weels.” There was, for once, 
no sardonic rasp to his voice. And 
his face, I saw, was bone-white. 
“Weels, permit me to be sure I 
understand you. It is your belief 
that this intelligent plan of seed- 
ing the world with poison to make 
it well will succeed, because you 
believe that a Signore Carmody 
will evict Defoe from power?” 

I said, “Well, not exactly — ” 
“But almost exactly? That is, 
you require this Millen Carmody 
for your plan?” 

“It wasn’t my plan. But you’re 
right about the other.” 

“Very good.” He extended the 
Handbook to me. “There is here 
a picture which calls itself Millen 
Carmody. Is that the man?” 

I glanced at the familiar warm 
eyes on the frontispiece. “That’s 
right. Have you seen him?” 

“I have, indeed.” The shaggy 
beard was twitching — I did not 
know whether with laughter or 
the coming of tears. “I saw him 
not long ago, Weels. It was in 
what they call Bay 100 — you 
remember? He was in a little 
bag like the pasta one carries 
home from a store. He was quite 



sound asleep, Weels, in the shelf 
just below the one I woke up in.” 

XV 

S O NOW AT last I knew why 
Millen Carmody had permit- 
ted Defoe to turn the Company 
into a prison cell for the world. 
He couldn’t forbid it, because the 
dead can forbid nothing, and Car- 
mody was sleeping with the dead. 
No wonder Defoe was so con- 
cerned with the Naples sector! 

How long? How long had Car- 
mody been quietly out of the 
way, while Defoe made his plans 
and took his steps, and someone 
in a little room somewhere con- 
fected “statements” with Millen 
Carmody’s signature on them and 
“interviews” that involved only 
one man? 

It could not have been less 
than five or six years, I thought, 
counting back to the time when 
Defoe’s name first began to regis- 
ter with me as an ordinary citi- 
zen, before I had married his 
cousin. Six years. That was the 
date of the Prague-Vienna war. 
And the year following, Hanoi 
clashed with Cebu. And the year 
after that, Auckland and Ade- 
laide. 

What in God’s name was De- 
foe’s plan? Nothing as simple as 
putting Carmody out of the way 
so that he could loot the Com- 
pany. No man could wish to be

that rich! It was meaningless. 

Defoe could be playing for 
only one thing — power. 

But it didn’t matter; all that 
mattered was that now I knew 
that Carmody was an enemy to 
Defoe. He was therefore an ally 
to Rena and to me, and we need- 
ed allies. But how might we get 
Carmody out of Bay 100? 

There weren’t any good an- 
swers, though Rena and I, with 
the help of grumbling comments 
from Zorchi, debated it until the 
morning light began to shine. 
Frontal assault on the clinic was 
ridiculous. Even a diversionary 
raid such as Rena had staged to 
try to rescue her father — only 
ten days before! — would hardly 
get us in through the triple- 
locked door of Bay 100. Even if 
Slovetski’s movement had still 
been able to muster the strength 
to do it, which was not likely. 

It was maddening. I had hid- 
den the hypodermic Rena had 
brought in Bay 100 to get it out 
of the way. Undoubtedly it was 
there still — perhaps only a few 
yards from Millen Carmody. If 
fifty cubic centimeters of a wat- 
ery purplish liquid could have 
been plucked from the little glass 
bottle and moved the mere inches 
to the veins of his arms, the prob- 
lem would be solved — for he 
could open the door from inside 
as easily as Zorchi had, and cer- 
tainly once he was that far we 

114 



could manage to get him out. 

But the thing was impossible, 
no matter how we looked at it. 

T SUPPOSE I fell asleep sitting 
in that chair, because I woke 
up in it. It was in the middle of 
a crazy nightmare about an 
avenging angel with cobalt-blue 
eyes burning at me out of heaven; 
and I wanted to run from him, 
but I was frozen by a little man 
with a hypodermic of ice. I woke 
up, and I was facing the television 
set. Someone — Rena, I suppose 
— had covered me with a light 
spread. The set was blaring a 
strident tenor voice. Zorchi was 
hunched over, watching some 
opera; I might as well have been 
a thousand miles away. 

I lay blearily watching the 
tiny figures flickering around the 
screen, not so much forgetting all 
the things that were on my mind 
as knowing what they were and 
that they existed, but lacking the 
strength to pick them up and look 
at them. The opera seemed to 
concern an Egyptian queen and 
a priest of some sort; I was not 
very interested in it, though it 
seemed odd that Zorchi should 
watch it so eagerly. 

Perhaps, after all, there was 
something to his maudlin self- 
pity — perhaps I really did think 
of him as a monster or a dog, for 
I was as uneasy to see him watch- 
ing an opera as I would have 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been to see an ape play the flute. 

I heard trucks going by on the 
highway. By and by it began to 
penetrate through the haze that 
I was hearing a lot of trucks go- 
ing by on the highway. I had no 
idea how heavily traveled the 
Naples-Caserta road might be, 
but from the sound, they seemed 
nearly bumper to bumper, whizz- 
ing along at seventy or eighty 
miles an hour. 

I got up stiffly and walked 
over to the window. 

I had not been far wrong. 
There was a steady stream of 
traffic in both directions — not 
only trucks but buses and private 
cars, everything from late-model 
gyromaxions to ancient piston- 
driven farm trucks. 

Zorchi heard me move, and 
turned toward me with a hooded 
expression. I pointed to the win- 
dow. 

“What’s up?” I asked. 

He said levelly, “The end of 
the world. It is now official; it has 
been on the television. Oh, they 
do not say it in just so many 
words, but it is there.” 

I turned to the television set 
and flicked off the tape-relay 
switch — apparently the opera 
had been recorded. Zorchi glared, 
but didn’t try to stop me as I 
hunted on the broadcast bands 
for a news announcer. 

I didn’t have far to hunt. Every 
channel was the same: The Com- 



pany was issuing orders and in- 
structions. Every man, woman 
and child was to be ready within 
ten days for commitment to the 
clinic. 

I tried to imagine the scenes 
of panic and turmoil that would 
be going on in downtown Naples 
at that moment. 

T>HE NEWSCASTER was say- 
ing: “Remember, if your 

Basic Blue Bolt policy number 
begins with the letters A, B or 
C — if it begins with the letters 
A, B or C — you are to report 
to the local first aid or emergency 
post at six hundred hours tomor- 
row. There is no danger. I repeat, 
there is no danger. This is merely 
a precaution taken by the Com- 
pany for your protection.” He 
didn’t really look as though there 
were no danger, however. He 
looked like a man confronted by 
a ghost. 

I switched to another channel. 
An equally harried-looking an- 
nouncer: “ — reported by a team 
of four physicists from the Royal 
University to have produced a 
serious concentration of radioac- 
tive byproducts in the upper at- 
mosphere. It is hoped that the 
cloud of dangerous gases will veer 
southward and pass harmlessly 
through the Eastern Mediter- 
ranean; however, strictly as a pre- 
cautionary measure, it is essential 
that every person in this area be 



PREFERRED RISK 



115 



placed in a safety zone during the 
danger period, the peak of which 
is estimated to come within the 
next fourteen days. If there is any 
damage, it will be only local and 
confined to livestock — for which 
you will be reimbursed under 
your Blue Bolt coverage.” 

I' switched to another channel. 
Local damage! Local to the face 
of the Earth! 

I tried all the channels; they 
were all the same. 

The Company had evidently 
decided to lie to the human race. 
Keep them in the dark — make 
each little section believe that 
only it was affected — persuade 
them that they would be under 
for, at most, a few weeks or 
months. 

Was that, I wondered, Defoe’s 
scheme? Was he planning to try 
somehow to convince four bil- 
lion people that fifty years were 
only a few weeks? It would never 
work — the first astronomer to 
look at a star, the first seaman 
to discover impossible errors in 
his tide table, would spot the lie. 

More likely he was simply pro- 
ceeding along what must always 
have been his basic assumption: 
The truth is wasted on the peo- 
ple. 

Zorchi said with heavy irony, 
“If my guest is quite finished 
with the instrument, perhaps he 
will be gracious enough to permit 
me to resume Aida.” 

116 



T WOKE RENA and told her 
about the evacuation. She said, 
yawning, “But of course, Tom. 
What else could they do?” And 
she began discussing breakfast. 

I went with her, but not to eat; 
in the dining hall was a small 
television set, and on it I could 
listen to the same repeat broad- 
casts over and over to my heart’s 
content. It was — in a way — 
a thrilling sight. It is always im- 
pressive to see a giant machine 
in operation, and there was no 
machine bigger than the Com- 
pany. 

The idea of suspending a whole 
world, even piecemeal, was stag- 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gering. But if there had been 
panic at first in the offices of the 
Company, none of it showed. The 
announcers were harried and 
there was bustle and strain, but 
order presided. 

Those long lines of vehicles 
outside the window; they were 
going somewhere; they were each 
one, I could see by the medallion 
slung across each radiator front, 
on the payroll of the Company. 

Perhaps the trick of pretending 



to each section that only it would 
be affected was wise — I don’t 
know. It was working, and I sup- 
pose that is the touchstone of 
wisdom. Naples knew that some- 
thing was going on in Rome, of 
course, but was doubtful about 
the Milanese Republic. The Ro- 
mans were in no doubt at all 
about Milan, but weren’t sure 
about the Duchy of Monaco, 
down the Riviera shore. And the 
man on the street, if he gave it 




PREFERRED RISK 



117 



a thought at all, must have been 
sure that such faraway places as 
America and China were escap- 
ing entirely. 

I suppose it was clever — 
there was no apparent panic. The 
trick took away the psychological 
horror of world catastrophe and 
replaced it with only a local ter- 
ror, no different in kind than an 
earthquake or a flood. And there 
was always the sack of gold at 
the end of every catastrophe : 
Blue Bolt would pay for damage, 
with a free and uncounting hand. 

Except that this time, of course, 
Blue Bolt would not, could not, 
pay at all. 

B Y NOON, Benedetto was out 
of bed. 

He shouldn’t have been, but he 
was conscious and we could not 
make him stay put — short of 
chains. 

He watched the television and 
then listened as Rena and I 
brought him up to date. Like me, 
he was shocked and then encour- 
aged to find that Millen Carmody 
was in the vaults — encouraged 
because it was at least a handle 
for us to grasp the problem with; 
if we could get at Carmody, per- 
haps we could break Defoe’s 
usurped power. Without him, De- 
foe would simply use the years 
while the world slept to forge 
a permanent dictatorship. 

We got the old man to lie 



down, and left him. But not for 
long. Within the hour he came 
tottering to where we were sit- 
ting, staring at the television. He 
waved aside Rena’s quick protest. 

“There is no time for rest, my 
daughter,” he said. “Do not scold 
me. I have a task.” 

Rena said worriedly, “Dear, 
you must stay in bed. The doctor 
said — ” 

“The doctor,” Benedetto said 
formally, “is a fool. Shall I allow 
us to die here? Am I an ancient 
idiot, or am I Benedetto dell’- 
Angela who with Slovetski led 
twenty thousand men?” 

Rena said, “Please! You’re 
sick!” 

“Enough.” Benedetto wavered, 
but stood erect. “I have tele- 
phoned. I have learned a great 
deal. The movement — ” he 
leaned against the wall for sup- 
port — “was not planned by 
fools. We knew there might be 
bad days; we do not collapse be- 
cause a few of us are put out of 
service by the Company. I have 
certain emergency numbers to 
call; I call them. And I find — ” 
he paused dramatically — “that 
there is news. Slovetski has 
escaped!” 

I said, “That’s impossible! De- 
foe wouldn’t let him go!” 

“Perhaps Slovetski did not con- 
sult him,” Benedetto said with 
dignity. “At any rate, he is free 
and not far from here. And he 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



is the answer we have sought, 
you understand.” 

“How?” I demanded. “What 
can he do that we can’t?” 

Benedetto smiled indulgently, 
though the smile was strained. 
His wound must have been giv- 
ing him hell; it had had just 
enough time to stiffen up. He 
said, “Leave that to Slovetski, 
Thomas. It is his metier, not 
yours. I shall go to him now.” 
Well, I did what I could; but 
Benedetto was an iron-necked 
old man. I forbade him to leave 
and he laughed at me. I begged 
him to stay and he thanked me 
— and refused. Finally I aban- 
doned him to Rena and Zorchi. 

Zorchi gave up almost at once. 
“A majestic man!” he said ad- 
miringly, as he rolled into the 
room where I was waiting, on his 
little power cart. “One cannot 
reason with him.” 

And Rena, in time, gave up, 
too. But not easily. She was weep- 
ing when she rejoined me. 

CHE HAD been unable even 
^ to get him to let her join him, 
or to consider taking someone 
else with him; he said it was his 
job alone. She didn’t even know 
where he was going. He had said 
it was not permissible, in so criti- 
cal a situation, for him to tell 
where Slovetski was. 

Zorchi coughed. “As to that,” 
he said, “I have already taken 



the liberty of instructing one of 
my associates to be ready. If the 
Signore has gone to meet Slovet- 
ski, my man is following him. .” 

So we waited, while the televi- 
sion announcers grew more and 
more grim-lipped and imperative. 

I listened with only half my 
mind. Part of my thoughts were 
with Benedetto, who should have 
been in a hospital instead of 
wandering around on some dan- 
gerous mission. And partly I was 
still filled with the spectacle that 
was unfolding before us. 

It was not merely a matter of 
preserving human lives. It was 
almost as important to provide 
the newly awakened men and 
women, fifty years from now, with 
food to eat and the homes and 
tools and other things that would 
be needed. 

Factories and transportation 
gear — according to the tele- 
casts — were being shut down 
and sealed to stand up under the 
time that would pass — “weeks,” 
according to the telecast, but who 
needed to seal a tool in oil for 
a few weeks? Instructions were 
coming hourly over the air on 
what should be protected in each 
home, and how it was to be done. 
Probably even fifty years would 
not seriously damage most of the 
world’s equipment — if the plans 
we heard on the air could be 
efficiently carried out. 

But the farms were another 



PREFERRED RISK 



119 



matter. The preserving of seeds 
was routine, but I couldn’t help 
wondering what these flat Italian 
fields would look like in fifty un- 
tended years. Would the radio- 
cobalt sterilize even the weeds? 
I didn’t think so, but I didn’t 
know. If not, would the Italian 
peninsula once again find itself 
covered with the dense forests 
that Caesar had marched through, 
where Spartacus and his runaway 
slaves had lurked and struck out 
against the Senators? 

And how many millions would 
die while the forests were being 
cleared off the face of the Earth 
again to make way for grain? 
Synthetic foods and food from 
the sea might solve that — the 
Company could find a way. But 
what about the mines — three, 
four and five thousand feet down 
— when the pumps were shut off 
and the underground water 
seeped in? What about the rails 
that the trains rode on? You 
could cosmoline the engines, per- 
haps, but how could you protect 
a million miles of track from the 
rains of fifty years? 

So I sat there, watching the 
television and waiting. Rena was 
too nervous to stay in one place. 
Zorchi had mysterious occupa- 
tions of his own. I sat and stared 
at the cathode screen. 

Until the door opened behind 
me, and I turned to look. 

Rena was standing there. Her 

120 



face was an ivory mask. She 
clutched the door as her father 
had a few hours before; I think 
she looked weaker and sicker 
than he. 

I said, for the first time, “Darl- 
ing!” She stood silent, staring at 
me. I asked apprehensively, 
“What is it?” 

The pale lips opened, but it 
was a moment before she could 
frame the words. Then her voice 
was hard to hear. “My father,” 
she said. “He reached the place 
where he was meeting Slovetski, 
but the expediters were there be- 
fore him. They shot him down in 
the street. And they are on their 
way here.” 

XVI 

TT WAS QUICK and brutal. 

Somehow Benedetto had been 
betrayed; the expediters had 
known where he had come from. 
And that was the end of that. 

They came swarming down on 
us in waves, at least a hundred 
of them, to capture a man, a girl 
and a cripple — Zorchi’s servants 
had deserted us, melting into the 
hemp fields like roaches into a 
garbage dump. Zorchi had a little 
gun, a Beretta; he fired it once 
and wounded a man. 

The rest was short and un- 
pleasant. 

They bound us and gagged us 
and flew us, trussed like game

for the spit, to the clinic. I caught 
a glimpse of milling mobs out- 
side the long, low walls as we 
came down. Then all I could see 
was the roof of the copter garage. 

We were brought to a tiny 
room where Defoe sat at a desk. 
The Underwriter was smiling. 
“Hello, Thomas,” he said, his eyes 
studying the bruise on my cheek. 
He turned toward Rena consid- 
eringly. “So this is your choice, 
eh, Thomas?” He studied Rena 
coolly. “Hardly my type. Still, by 
sticking with me, you could have 
had a harem.” 

Bound as I was, I started for- 
ward. Something hit me in the 
back at my first step, driving a 
hot rush of agony up from my 
kidneys. Defoe watched me catch 
my breath without a change of 
expression. 

“My men are quite alert, 
Thomas. Please do not try that 
again. Once is amusing, but twice 
would annoy me.” He sighed. “I 
seem to have been wrong about 
you, Thomas. Perhaps because I 
needed someone’s help, I over- 
estimated you. I thought long 
ago that beneath your condition- 
ing you had brains. Manning is 
a machine, good for taking orders. 
Dr. Lawton is loyal, but not in- 
telligent. And between loyalty 
and intelligence, I’ll take brains. 
Loyalty I can provide for my- 
self.” He nodded gravely at the 
armed expediters. 



Zorchi spat. “Kill us, butcher,” 
he ordered. “It is enough I die 
without listening to your foolish 
babbling.” 

Defoe considered him. “You 
interest me, Signore. A surprise, 
finding you revived and with 
Wills. Before we’re finished, you 
must tell me about that.” 

I saw Zorchi bristle and open 
his mouth, but a cold, suddenly 
calculating idea made me inter- 
rupt. “To get dell’ Angela out as 
an attendant, I needed a patient 
for him to wheel. Zorchi had 
money, and I expected gratitude 
when I revived him later. It 
wasn’t hard getting Lawton’s as- 
sistant to stack his cocoon near 
Benedetto’s.” 

“Lawton!” Defoe grimaced, but 
seemed to accept the story. He 
smiled at me suddenly. “I had 
hopes for you, then. That escape 
was well done — simple, direct. 
A little crude, but a good begin- 
ning. You could have been my 
number one assistant, Thomas. I 
thought of that when I heard of 
the things you were saying after 
Marianna died — I thought you 
might be awaking.” 

I licked my lips. “And when 
you picked me up after Mari- 
anna’s death, and bailed me out 
of jail, you made sure the expe- 
diter corps had information that 
I was possibly not reliable. You 
made sure the information 
reached the underground, so they

121 



would approach me and I could 
spy for you. You wanted a patsy!” 
The smile was gleaming this 
time. “Naturally, until you could 
prove yourself. And of course, I 
had you jailed for the things you 
said because I wanted it that way. 
A pity all my efforts were wasted 
on you, Thomas. I’m afraid you’re 
not equipped to be a spy.” 

It took everything I had, but 
this time I managed to smile 
back. “On which side, Defoe? 
How many spies know you’ve 
got Millen Carmody down in 
Bay — ” 

That hit him. But I didn’t have 
time to enjoy it. He made a sud- 
den gesture, and the expediters 
moved. This time, when they 
dragged me down, it was very 
bad. 

W HEN I came to, I was in 
another room. Zorchi and 
Rena were with me, but not De- 
foe. It was a preparation cham- 
ber, racked with instruments, 
furnished with surgical benches. 

A telescreen was flickering and 
blaring unheeded at one end of 
the room. I caught a glimpse of 
scenes of men, women and chil- 
dren standing in line, going in 
orderly queues through the medi- 
cal inspections, filing into the 
clinic and its local branch sta- 
tions for the sleep drug. The 
scenes were all in Naples; but 
they must have been, with local 

122 



variations, on every telescreen on 
the globe. 

Dr. Lawton appeared. He com- 
manded coldly: “Take your 

clothes off.” 

I think that was the most hu- 
miliating moment of all. 

It was, of course, only a medi- 
cal formality. I knew that the 
suspendees had to be nude in 
their racks. But the very imper- 
sonality of the proceeding made 
it ugly. Reluctantly I began to 
undress, as did Rena, silent and 
withdrawn, and Zorchi, sputter- 
ing anger and threats. My whole 
body was a mass of redness; in a 
few hours the red would turn to 
purple and black, where the hoses 
of the expediters had caressed 
me. 

Or did a suspendee bruise? 
Probably not. But it was small 
satisfaction. 

Lawton was looking smug; no 
doubt he had insisted on the 
privilege of putting us under him- 
self after I’d blamed him for 
Zorchi’s escape. I couldn’t blame 
him; I would have returned the 
favor with great joy. 

Well, I had wanted to reach 
Millen Carmody, and Defoe was 
granting my wish. We might even 
lie on adjacent racks in Bay 100. 
After what I’d told Defoe, we 
should rate such reserved space! 

Lawton approached with the 
hypospray, and a pair of expe- 
diters grabbed my arms. He said: 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“I want to leave one thought with 
you, Wills. Maybe it will give 
you some comfort.” His smirk 
told me that it certainly would 
not. “Only Defoe and I can open 
Bay 100,” he reminded me. “I 
don’t think either of us will; and 
I expect you will stay there a 
long, long time.” 

He experimentally squirted a 
faint mist from the tip of the 
hypospray and nodded satisfac- 
tion. He went on: “The suspen- 
sion is effective for a long time 
— several hundred years, per- 
haps. But not forever. In time 
the enzymes of the body begin 
to digest the body itself.” He 
pursed his lips thoughtfully. “I 
don’t know if the sleeping brain 
knows it is pain or not. If it does, 
you’ll know what it feels like to 
dissolve in your own gutwash. .” 

He smiled. “Good night,” he 
crooned, and bent over my arm. 

The spray from the end of the 
hypo felt chilly, but not at all 
painful. It was as though I had 
been touched with ice; the cold 
clung, and spread. 

I was vaguely conscious of be- 
ing dumped on one of the surgi- 
cal tables, even more vaguely 
aware of seeing Rena slumping 
across another. 

The light in the room yellowed, 
flickered and went out. 

I thought I heard Rena’s 
voice . 

Then I heard nothing. And I 



saw nothing. And I felt nothing, 
except the penetrating cold, and 
then even the cold was gone. 

XVII 

1Y|‘Y NERVES throbbed with 
the prickling of an infinity 
of needles. I was cold — colder 
than I had ever been. And over 
everything else came the insist- 
ent, blurred voice of Luigi Zorchi. 
“Weels! Week!” 

At first it was an annoyance. 
Then, abruptly, full consciousness 
came rushing back, bringing some 
measure of triumph with it. It 
had worked! My needling of De- 
foe and my concealing of Zorchi’s 
ability to revive himself had suc- 
ceeded in getting us all put into 
Bay 100, where the precious 
hypodermic and fluid were hid- 
den. After being pushed from pil- 
lar to post and back, even that 
much success was enough to 
shock me into awareness. 

My heart was thumping like a 
rusty cargo steamer in a high sea. 
My lungs ached for air and 
burned when they got it. But I 
managed to open my eyes to see 
Zorchi bending over me. Beyond 
him, I saw the blue-lighted steril- 
izing lamps, the door that opened 
from inside, and the racked sus- 
pendees of Bay 100. 

“It is time! But now finally 
you awake, you move!” Zorchi 
grumbled. “The body of Zorchi

does not surrender to poisons; it 
throws them off. But then be- 
cause of these small weak legs, 
I must wait for you! Come, Weels, 
no more dallying! We have still 
work to do to escape this abomin- 
ation!” 

I sat up clumsily, but the drugs 
seemed to have been neutralized. 
I was on the bottom tier, and I 
managed to locate the floor with 
my legs and stand up. “Thanks, 
Zorchi,” I told him, trying to 
avoid looking at his ugly, naked 
body and the things that were 
almost his legs. 

“Thanks are due,” he admitted. 
“I am a modest man who expects 
no praise, but I have done much. 
I cannot deny it. It took great- 
ness to crawl through this bay 
to find you. On my hands and 
these baby knees, Weels, I 
crawled. Almost I am overcome 
with wonder at so heroic — But 
I digress. Weels, waste no more 
time in talking. We must revive 
the others who are above my 
reach. Then let us, for God, go 
and find food.” 

Somehow, though I was still 
weak, I managed to follow Zorchi 
and drag down the sacks contain- 
ing Rena and Carmody. And 
while waiting for them to revive, 
I began to realize how little 
chance we would have to escape 
this time, naked and uncertain of 
what state affairs were in. I also 
realized what might happen if 



Lawton or Defoe decided to 
check up on Bay 100 now! 

For the few minutes while 
Rena revived and recognized me, 
and while I explained how I’d 
figured it out, it was worth any 
risk. Then finally, Carmody 
stirred and sat up. Maybe we 
looked enough like devils in a 
blue hell to justify his first 
expression. 

H E WASN’T much like my 
mental image of the great 
Millen Carmody. His face was 
like his picture, but it was an 
older face and haggard under the 
ugly light. Age was heavy on him, 
and he couldn’t have been a noble 
figure at any time. Now he was 
a pot-bellied little man with 
scrawny legs and a faint tremble 
to his hands. 

But there was no fat in his 
mind as he tried to absorb our 
explanations while he answered 
our questions in turn. He’d come 
to Naples, bringing his personal 
physician, Dr. Lawton. His last 
memory was of Lawton giving 
him a shot to relieve his indiges- 
tion. 

It must have been rough to 
wake up here after that and find 
what a mess had been made of 
the world. But he took it, and his 
questions became sharper as he < 
groped for the truth. Finally he 
sat back, nodding sickly. “Defoe!” 
he said bitterly. “Well, what do 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



we do now, Mr. Wills?” 

It shook me. I’d unconsciously- 
expected him to take over at 
once. But the eyes of Rena and 
Zorchi also turned to me. Well, 
there wasn’t much choice. We 
couldn’t stay here and risk dis- 
covery. Nor could we hide any- 
where in the clinic; when Defoe 
found us gone, no place would 
be safe. 

“We pray,” I decided. “And if 
prayers help, maybe we’ll find 
some way out.” 

“I can help,” Carmody offered. 
He grimaced. “I know this place 
and the combination to the pri- 
vate doors. Would it help if we 
reached the garage?” 

I didn’t know, but the garage 
was half a mile beyond the main 
entrance. If we could steal a car, 
we might make it. We had to try. 

There were sounds of activity 
when we opened the door, but 
the section we were in seemed 
to be filled, and the storing of 
suspendees had moved elsewhere. 

We shut and relocked the door 
and followed Carmody through 
the seemingly endless corridors, 
with Zorchi hobbling along, lean- 
ing on Rena and me and sweating 
in agony. We offered to carry him, 
but he would have none of that. 
We moved further and further 
back, while the sight of Carmody’s 
round, bare bottom ahead ripped 
my feeling of awe for him into 
smaller and smaller shreds. 



He stopped at a door I had 
almost missed and his fingers 
tapped out something on what 
looked like an ornamental pat- 
tern. The door opened to reveal 
stairs that led down two flights, 
winding around a small elevator 
shaft. At the bottom was a long 
corridor that must be the one 
leading underground to the gar- 
age. Opposite the elevator was 
another door, and Carmody 
worked its combination to reveal 
a storeroom, loaded with supplies 
the expediters might need. 

He ripped a suit of the heavy 
gray coveralls off the wall and 
began donning them. “Radiation 
suits,” he explained. They were 
ugly things, but better than noth- 
ing. Anyone seeing us in them 
might think we were on official 
business. Zorchi shook off our 
help and somehow got into a pair. 
Then he grunted and began pull- 
ing hard-pellet rifles and bando- 
liers of ammunition off the wall. 

«|VOW, WEELS, we are pre- 
’ pared. Let them come 
against us. Zorchi is ready!” 

“Ready to kill yourself!” I said 
roughly. “Those things take prac- 
tice!” 

“And again I am the freak — 
the case who can do nothing that 
humans can do, eh, Weels?” He 
swore thickly, and there was 
something in his voice that 
abruptly roughened it. “Never

Zorchi the man! There are Sicil- 
ians who would tell you different, 
could they open dead mouths to 
speak of their downed planes!” 

“He was the best jet pilot 
Naples had,” Rena said quietly. 

It was my turn to curse. He 
was right; I hadn’t thought of 
him as a man, or considered that 
he could do anything but regrow 
damaged tissues. “I’m sorry, 
Luigi!” 

“No matter.” He sighed, and 
then shrugged. “Come, take arms 
and ammunition and let us be 
out of this place. Even the nose 
of Zorchi can stand only so much 
of the smell of assassins!” 

We moved down the passage, 
staggering along for what seemed 
to be hours, expecting every 
second to run into some official 
or expediter force. But apparent- 
ly the passage wasn’t being used 
much during the emergency. We 
finally reached stairs at the other 
end and headed up, afraid to 
attract attention by taking the 
waiting elevator. 

At the top, Carmody frowned 
as he studied the side passages 
and doors. “Here, I guess,” he 
decided. “This may still be a less 
used part of the garage.” He 
reached for the door. 

I stopped him. “Wait a minute. 
Is there any way back in, once 
we leave?” 

“The combination will work 
— the master combination used 

126 



by the Company heads. Other- 
wise, these doors are practically 
bomb-proof!” He pressed the 
combination and opened the door 
a crack. 

Outside, I could see what 
seemed to be a small section of 
the Company car pool. There 
were sounds of trucks, but none 
were moving nearby. I saw a few 
men working on trucks a dis- 
tance from us. Maybe luck was 
on our side. 

I pointed to the nearest expe- 
diter patrol wagon — a small 
truck, really, enclosed except for 
the driver’s seat. “That one, if 
there’s fuel. We’ll have to act as 
if we had a right to it, and hope 
for the best. Zorchi, can you man- 
age it that far?” 

“I shall walk like a born assas- 
sin,” he assured me, but sweat 
began popping onto his forehead 
at what he was offering. Yet there 
was no sign of the agony he must 
have felt as he followed and 
managed to climb into the back 
with Rena and Carmody. 

The fuel gauge was at the half 
mark and, as yet, there was no 
cry of alarm. I gunned the motor 
into life, watching the nearest 
workmen. They looked up casu- 
ally, and then went back to their 
business. Ahead, I could see a 
clear lane toward the exit, with 
a few other trucks moving in and 
out. I headed for it, my hair 
prickling at the back of my neck. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



W E REACHED the entrance, 
passed through it, and were 
soon blending into the stream of 
cars that were passing the clinic 
on their way out for more suspen- 
sion cases. 

The glass doors of the entrance 
were gone now, and workmen 
were putting up huge steel ones 
in their place, even while a steady 
stream of cases were hobbling or 
being carried into the clinic. Most 
of them were old or shabby, I 
noticed. The class-D type. The 
last ones to be admitted. We 
must have spent more time in 
the vault than I’d thought, and 
zero hour was drawing near. 

Beyond the clinic, the whole 
of Anzio was a mass of aban- 
doned cars that seemed to stretch 
for miles, arid the few buildings 
not boarded up were obviously 
class-D dwellings, too poor to 
worry about. I cursed my way 
through a jam-up of trucks, and 
managed to find one of the side 
roads. 

Then I pressed down on 
the throttle as far as I dared 
without attracting attention, until 
I could find a safe place to turn 
off with no other cars near to see 
me. 

“Where to?” I asked. We 
couldn’t go back to Zorchi’s, since 
any expediter investigation would 
start there. Maybe we’d never be 
missed, but I couldn’t risk it. If 
we had to, we could use some 



abandoned villa and hide out, but 
I was hoping for a better sugges- 
tion. 

Zorchi looked blank, and Rena 
shrugged. “If we could only find 
Nikolas — ” she suggested doubt- 
fully. 

I shook my head. I’d had a 
chance to think about that a 
little while the expediters took 
us to see Defoe, and I didn’t 
like it. The leader of the revolu- 
tion had apparently been cap- 
tured by Defoe. According to 
Benedetto dell’Angela, he’d es- 
caped. Yet Defoe hadn’t tried to 
pump us about him. And when 
Benedetto set out to meet him, 
the expediters had descended at 
once. 

It made an ugly picture. I 
had no wish to go looking for the 
man. 

“There’s my place,” Carmody 
said finally. “I had places all over 
the world, kept ready for me and 
stocked. If Defoe let it be thought 
that I had retired, he must have 
kept them all up as I’d have done. 
Wait, let me orient myself. Up 
that road.” 

Places all over the world, with 
food that was wasted, and with 
servants who might never see 
their master! And I’d been 
brought up believing that the 
Underwriters were men of quiet, 
simple tastes! Carmody’s clay 
feet were beginning to crumble 
up to the navel! 



PREFERRED RISK 



127 



T HE VILLA was surrounded 
by trees, on a low hill that 
overlooked an artificial lake. It 
had been sealed off, but the com- 
bination lock yielded to Car- 
mody’s touch. There were beds 
made up and waiting, freezers 
stocked with food that sent Zor- 
chi into ecstasy, and even a com- 
plete file of back issues of the 
Company paper. Carmody head- 
ed for those, with the look of a 
man hunting his lost past. He 
had a lot of catching up to do. 

But it was the television set 
that interested me. It was still 
working, with taped material be- 
ing broadcast. The appeal had 
been stepped up, asking for order 
and cooperation; I recognized the 
language as being pitched toward 
the lower classes now, though. 
And the clicking of a radiation- 
counter sounded as a constant 
background, with occasional shots 
of its meter, the needle well into 
the danger area. 

Zorchi joined me and Rena, 
dribbling crumbs of meat down 
his beard. He snorted as he 
caught sight of the counter. 
“There is a real one in the other 
room, and it registers higher,” he 
said. “It is interesting. For me, of 
no import. Doctors whom I trust 
have said Defoe is wrong; my 
body can resist damage from 
radiation — and perhaps even 
from old age. But for you and 
the young lady . .”

He shut up at my expression, 
but the tape cut off and a live 
announcer came on before I 
could say anything. “A bulletin 
just in,” he said, “shows that the 
government of Naples has unani- 
mously passed a moritorium on 
all contracts, obligations and in- 
debtedness for the duration of 
the emergency. The Company has 
just followed this with a declara- 
tion that it will extend the mori- 
torium to include all crimes 
against the Company. During the 
emergency, the clinics will be 
available to all without prejudice, 
Director Defoe said today.” 

“A trap,” Rena guessed. “We 
wouldn’t have a chance, anyhow. 
But, Tom, does the other mean 
that — ” 

“It means your father was 
wrong,” I answered. “As of right 
now — and probably in every 
government at the same time — 
the Company has been freed from 
any responsibility.” 

It didn’t make any difference, 
of course. Benedetto had expect- 
ed that everyone must secretly 
hate the Company as he did; he 
hadn’t realized that men who 
have just been saved from the 
horrible danger of radiation death 
aren’t going to turn against the 
agency that saved them. And 
damn it, the Company was sav- 
ing them, after its opponents had 
risked annihilation of the race. 
Defoe would probably make sure 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the suspendees were awakened at 
a rate where he could keep abso- 
lute power, but not from any 
danger of bankruptcy. 

C ARMODY had come out and 
listened, attracted by the 
broadcast radiation clicking, ap- 
parently. Now he asked enough 
questions to discover Benedetto’s 
idea, and shook his head. 

“It wouldn’t work,” he agreed 
with me. “Even if I still had con- 
trol, I couldn’t permit such a 
thing. What good would it do? 
Could money payments make 
food for a revived world, Miss 
dell’Angela? Would bankrupting 
the only agency capable of re- 
building the Earth be a thing of 
honor? Besides, even with what 
I’ve read, I can see no hope. 
There’s nothing we can do.” 

“But if you can arouse the 
other Underwriters against De- 
foe,” she insisted, “at least you 
can prevent his type of world!” 
He shook his head. “How? All 
communications are in his hands. 
Even if I could fly to the Home 
Office, most of the ones I could 
trust — and there apparently are 
a few Defoe hasn’t been able to 
retire — would be scattered, out 
of my reach. A week ago, there 
might have been a chance. Now, 
it’s impossible. Impossible.” 

He shook his head sadly and 
wandered back toward the li- 
brary. I could see that in his 



secret thoughts, he was wishing 
we’d left him safely in the vault. 
Maybe it would have been just 
as well. 

“Cheer up,” I told Rena. “Car- 
mody’s an old man — too old to 
think in terms of direct action, 
even when it’s necessary. Defoe 
doesn’t own the world yet!” 

But later, when I located the 
books I wanted in the library 
and went out into the vine-cov- 
ered bower in the formal garden, 
I wasn’t as confident as I’d pre- 
tended. 

Thinking wasn’t a pleasant job, 
after all the years when I’d let 
others do my thinking for me. 
But now I had to do it for my- 
self. Otherwise, the only alterna- 
tive was to plan some means of 
quick death for us all before the 
radiation got too intense. And I 
couldn’t accept that. 

Rena had managed something 
Marianna couldn’t have con- 
ceived — she’d quietly relin- 
quished her fate into my hands, 
gambling on me with everything 
she had. Whether I wanted to or 
not, I’d taken the responsibility. 
Carmody was an old man, one 
who hadn’t been able to keep 
Defoe from taking over in the 
first place. And Zorchi — well, 
he was Zorchi. 

That night, the radiation de- 
tector suddenly took a sharp lift, 
its needle crossing over into the 
red. It was probably only a local

rise. But it didn’t make my think- 
ing any more comfortable. 

I T WAS AT breakfast that next 
morning when I finally took 
it up with Carmody. “Just what 
will the situation be at the clinic 
after they close down? How 
many will be kept awake? And 
what about their defenses?” 

He frowned, trying to see my 
idea. Then he shrugged. “Too 
many, Tom. We had plotted out 
a course for such things as this 
a number of times in Planning. 
And our mob psychologists 
warned that there’d inevitably be 
a few who for one reason or an- 
other wouldn’t come in in time, 
but who would then grow desper- 
ate and try to break in. Outlaws, 
looters, procrastinators, fanatics. 
That sort. So for some time, 
there should be at least twenty 
guards kept alert. And that’s 
enough to defend a clinic. Atomic 
cannon at every entrance, of 
course, and the clinics are bomb- 
proof.” 

“Twenty, eh? And how about 
Defoe and Lawton? Will they 
sleep?” It seemed logical that 
they couldn’t stay out of suspen- 
sion for the whole fifty years or 
so. There’d be no profit to gain- 
ing a world after they were too 
old to use it. 

“Not at first. There’s a great 
deal of final administrative work 
to be done. There’s a chamber 



equipped to keep a hundred or 
so men awake with radiation 
washed from the air, and con- 
taining adequate supplies, in 
cable contact with other clinics. 
They’ll be there. Later, they’ll 
take shifts, with only a couple of 
men awake at a time, I suppose. 
They may age a little that way, 
but not much.” 

He frowned again, and then 
slowly nodded. “It could be done, 
if we had some way to wait safe- 
ly for six months. Getting back 
in is no problem for me.” 

“It’s going to be done,” I told 
him. “And a lot sooner. Are you 
willing to take the chance?” 

“Have I any choice?” He 
shrugged again. “Do you think I 
haven’t been sick at the idea of 
a man like Defoe in command 
of the Company for as long as he 
lives? Tom, my family started 
the Company. I’ve got an obliga- 
tion to restore it to its right 
course. If there’s any chance of 
keeping Defoe from being em- 
peror of the world, I’ve got to 
take it. If you can put me in a 
position where I can get the hon- 
est Underwriters together again, 
where we can set up the Com- 
pany as it was — ” 

“Why? So this will happen all 
over again?” 

He looked shocked at Rena’s 
question. “I don’t blame you for 
being bitter, Miss dell’Angela. 
But with Defoe gone — ” 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“The Company made Defoe 
possible. In fact, it made him and 
Slovetski inevitable,” I told him 
flatly. “That’s its one great crime. 
Whenever you take power com- 
^ pletely out of the hands of the 
many, it winds up in fewer and 
fewer hands. Those histories I 
was reading last night prove that. 
Carmody, what do you know 
about your own Company? Or 
the world? Leave the consolida- 
tion of power in Company hands 
out of it, and what has happened 
to progress?” 

He frowned. “Well, we’ve lev- 
eled off a bit. We had to. We 
couldn’t risk — ” 

“Exactly. You couldn’t risk re- 
search that would lead to in- 
creased longevity — too many 
pensioners. You couldn’t risk go- 
ing to Mars — unpredictable 
dangers. You had to make the 
world fit actuarial charts. I re- 
member seeing one of the first 
suspendees awakened. He ex- 
pected things we could have done 
fifty years ago — and never will 
do. How many men today work 
their way out of their class? And 
why have classes so rigidly strati- 
fied? I’ve been reading your own 
speeches of nearly fifty years ago. 
I’ve got them here, together with 
some tables. Like to see them?” 

H E TOOK the papers silently 
and began going through 
them, his shock giving way to a 



grudging realization. Maybe with- 
out the jolt of his awakening, he’d 
have laughed them off, but noth- 
ing was easy to dismiss with the 
hell brewing outside. At last he 
looked up. 

“Tom, I’ll admit the many 
times when I’ve been worried. 
I’ve considered starting research 
again countless times. I’ve been 
aware that dependence was grow- 
ing too heavy on the Company. 
But we can’t just toss it aside. It 
did bring an end to major war, 
when such a war would have 
ruined the Earth completely. It 
showed that nobody had to starve 
— that hardly anyone had to 
lack for any necessity, or die for 
lack of care. You can’t throw 
that away.” 

“You can throw away its unre- 
lated power.” I knew I didn’t 
have the answers. All this had 
been growing slowly in my mind 
since I’d first found Benedetto a 
political prisoner, but a lifetime 
wasn’t enough to think it out, 
even with the books I’d found. 

But I had to try. “In the middle 
ages, they had morality and poli- 
tics tied into one bundle, Car- 
mody. The church ruled. It wasn’t 
good and they finally had to di- 
vorce church and state. Maybe 
the same applies to administra- 
tive politics and economics. The 
Company has shown what can be 
done economically. The church 
has survived as a great moral

force outside material power. 
Now let’s see if we can’t put 
things in perspective. 

“There’s a precedent. The 
United States — the old govern- 
ment — was set up on the idea 
of balance of power: an elected 
Congress for the people to handle 
legislative tasks, a selected Presi- 
dent to handle executive affairs, 
and a Judiciary mostly independ- 
ent. On a world scale, as it can 
be done today — since the Com- 
pany has really made it one 
world — the same can be done, 
with something like the Com- 
pany to insure economics.” 

“I suppose every man who had 
any idealism has thought the 
same,” Carmody said slowly. He 
sighed softly. “I remember trying 
to preach it to my father when 
I was just out of college. You’re 
right. But can you set up such 
a perfect government? Can I? 
Tell me how, Tom, and I’ll give 
you your chance, if I can.” 

Zorchi laughed cynically, but 
that was what I’d hoped Carmody 
might say. 

“All right,” I told him. “We 
can’t do it. No one man is fit to 
rule, ever, or to establish rule. 
Oh, I had wish-dreams, a few 
days ago, I suppose, about what 
I’d do, if! But men have set out 
to establish new systems before, 
and done good jobs of it. Read 
the Constitution — a system put 
together artificially by expert 



political thinkers, and good for 
two hundred years, at least! And 
they didn’t have our opportuni- 
ties. For the first time, the world 
has to wait. Get the best minds 
you can, Carmody. Give them 
twenty-five years to work it out. 
They can come up with an an- 
swer. And then, when the world 
is awakened, you can start with 
it, fresh, without upsetting any 
old order. Is that your answer?” 
“Most of it.” There was a sud- 
den light in his old eyes. “Yes, 
the sleep does make the chance 
possible. But how are you going 
to get the experts and assemble 
them?” 

I pointed to Zorchi. “Hermes, 
the messenger of the gods. He’s 
a jet pilot who can get all over 
the world. And he can move out- 
side, without needing to worry 
about radiation.” 

“So?” Zorchi snorted again. 
“So, I am now your messenger, 
Weels! Do you think I would 
trouble myself so much for all 
of you, Weels?” 

I grinned at him. “You defiant- 
ly speak of being a man. That 
makes you part of the human 
race. I’m simply taking you at 
your word.” 

“So?” he repeated, his face 
wooden. “Such a messenger 
would have much power, Weels. 
Suppose I choose to be Zorchi 
the ruler?” 

“Not while Zorchi the man is 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



also Zorchi the freak,” I said with 
deliberate cruelty. “Go look at 
yourself.” 

And suddenly he smiled, his 
lips drawing back from his teeth. 
“Weels, for the first time you are 
honest. And for that as well as 
that I am a man, I will be Zorchi 
the messenger. But first, should 
we not decide on a plan of action? 
Or do we first rule and then 
conquer?” 

“We wait first,” I told him. 

On the wall, the radiation indi- 
cator clicked steadily, its needle 
moving further into the red. 

XVIII 

T HE SECOND day, the tele- 
vision went off the air with 
the final curt announcement that 
anyone not inside the clinics at 
noon would be left outside per- 
manently. Then the set went 
dead, leaving only the clucking 
and beeping of our own radiation 
indicator. I’d thrown it out twice 
and brought it back both times. 

Civilization had ended on the 
third day, though all the con- 
veniences in the villa went on 
smoothly, except for the meter 
reading that told us nothing could 
be smooth. It was higher than 
the predictions I had heard, 
though I still hoped that was only 
a sporadic local phenomenon 
that would level out later. In the 
face of that, it was hard to be- 



lieve that even a few men would 
remain outside the clinics, though 
I was counting on it. 

We waited another twenty-four 
hours, forcing ourselves to sit in 
the villa, discussing plans, when 
our nerves were yelling for ac- 
tion. We had only an estimate to 
go on. If we got there too soon, 
there would be more awake than 
we could handle. Too late and 
we’d be radiation cases, good for 
nothing but the vaults. 

It was a relief to leave at last, 
taking our weapons in the truck. 
We were wearing the radiation 
suits, hoping they’d protect us, 
and Zorchi spent the last two 
days devising pads and straps to 
cushion and strengthen his de- 
veloping legs. 

The world was dead. Cars had 
been abandoned in the middle 
of the road, making driving diffi- 
cult. 

The towns and villas were 
deserted, boarded up or simply 
abandoned. We might have been 
the last men on Earth, and we 
felt that we were as we headed 
for Anzio. This wasn’t just a 
road, or Naples — or all of Italy. 
It was the world. 

Then Rena pointed. Ahead, a 
boy was walking beside a dog, 
the animal’s left rear leg bound 
and splintered as if it had been 
broken. I started to slow, then 
forced myself to drive on. As we 
passed, I saw that the boy was 



PREFERRED RISK 



133 



about fourteen, and his face was 
dirty and tear-streaked. He shook 
one fist at us, and came trudging 
on. 

“If we win, we’ll have the door 
open when he gets there,” Rena 
said. “For him and his dog! If 
not, it won’t matter how long it 
takes him. You couldn’t stop, 
Tom.” 

It didn’t make me feel any 
better. But now dusk was falling, 
and we slowed, waiting until it 
was dark to park quietly near 
the garage. In front of the en- 
trance, I could see a small ring 
of fires, and by their light a few 
figures moving about. They were 
madmen, of course — and yet, 
probably less mad than others 
who must be prowling through 
the towns, looting for things they 
could never use. 

It seemed incredible that any 
one could be outside, but the 
psychologists had apparently 
been right. These were deter- 
mined men, willing to wait for 
the forlorn chance that some 
miracle might give them a futile, 
even more forlorn chance to try 
battering down the great doors. 
Maybe somewhere in the world, 
such a group might succeed. But 
not here. As I watched, there was 
a crackle of automatic gunfire 
from the entrance. The guards 
were awake, all right, and not 
taking chances on any poor devil 
getting too close. 

134 



nHHERE were no guards in the 
vault garage. We were pre- 
pared in case someone might be 
stationed inside the private en- 
trance, as much prepared as we 
could be; since Carmody had 
been listed as still living, an ordi- 
nary guard who recognized him 
would probably let us in first and 
then try to report — giving us 
time to handle him. But we were 
lucky. The door opened to Car- 
mody’s top-secret combination. 

“We designed such combina- 
tions into a few doors in case of 
internal revolution locally while 
no Underwriters were around. We 
never considered having an Un- 
derwriter lead a revolution from 
outside,” he whispered to us. 

The underground passage was 
deserted, and this time Carmody 
led through another corridor, to 
a stairs that seemed to wind up 
forever. Zorchi groaned, then 
caught himself. 

“It leads to the main reception 
room,” Carmody said. 

With the men outside, most of 
the guards who still remained 
awake might be there. But we 
had to chance it. We stopped 
when we reached the top, catch- 
ing our breath while Zorchi sank 
to the floor, writhing silently. 

Then Rena threw back the 
door, Zorchi’s rifle poked through, 
and I was leaping for the main 
door controls, hoping the memory 
I had was accurate. I was nearly 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to them when the two guards 
standing beside them turned. 

They yelled, just as my rifle 
spat. At that range, I couldn’t 
miss. And behind, I heard Zorchi’s 
gun spit. The second guard 
slumped sickly to the floor, hold- 
ing his stomach. I grabbed for 
the controls, while other yells 
sounded, and feet began pound- 
ing toward me. 

There was no time to look 
back. The doors were slowly mov- 
ing apart and Carmody was be- 
side me, smashing a maul from 
the storeroom onto the electronic 
controls of the atomic cannon. I 
twisted between the opening 
doors. 

“We’ve seized the vaults,” I 
shouted. “We need help. Any man 
who joins us will be saved!” 

I couldn’t wait to watch, but I 
heard a hoarse, answering shout, 
and the sound of feet. 

Carmody’s maul had ruined 
the door controls. But the other 
guards were nearly on us. I saw 
two more sprawled on the floor. 
Zorchi hadn’t missed. Then Car- 
mody’s fingers had found another 
of the private doors that looked 
like simple panels here. Rena 
and Carmody were through, and 
I yanked Zorchi after me, just as 
a bullet whined over his head. 
Behind us, I heard uncontrolled 
yelling as men from outside be- 
gan pouring in. 

It was our only hope. They 



had to take care of the guards, 
who were still probably shocked 
at finding us inside. We headed 
for the private quarters where 
Defoe would be, praying that 
there would be only a few there. 

r 1 1 HIS PASSAGE was useless 
to us, though. It led from 
office to office for the doctors 
who superintended here. We 
came out into an office, watching 
our chance for the hall we had 
to take. I could see the men who 
had been outside in action now. 
A few had guns of some kind, 
but the clubs in the hands of the 
others were just as deadly in such 
a desperation attack; men who 
had seen themselves already dead 
weren’t afraid of chances. About 
a score of the expediter guards 
were trying to hold off at least 
twice their number. 

Then the hall seemed clear and 
we leaped into it. Suddenly gongs 
began ringing everywhere. Some 
guard had finally reached or re- 
membered the alarm system. Car- 
mody cursed, and tried to move 
faster. 

The small private vault for the 
executives lay through the ad- 
ministration quarters and down 
several levels, before it was en- 
tered through a short passage- 
way. Carmody had mapped it for 
me often enough. But he knew 
it by physical memory, which 
was better than my training. He’d 



PREFERRED RISK 



135 



also taught me the combination, 
but I left the door to his prac- 
ticed fingers when we came to it. 

The elevator wasn’t up. We 
couldn’t wait. We raced down the 
stairs that circled it. Here Car- 
mody’s age told against him, and 
he fell behind. Rena and I were 
toing down neck and neck with 
Zorchi throwing himself along 
with us. He had dropped his rifle 
and picked up a sub-machine gun 
from one of the fallen guards, and 
he clung to it now, using only 
one hand on the rail. 

It was a reflection on a gun- 
barrel that saved us. The picked 
expediters were hidden in the 
dark mouth of the passageway, 
waiting for us to turn the stairs. 
But I caught a gleam of metal, 
and threw up my gun. Instantly, 
Zorchi was beside me, the sub- 
machine splitting as quickly as I 
could fire the first shot. “Aim for 
the wall. Ricochet!” 

The ambushers had counted 
too much on surprise. They 
weren’t ready to have the tables 
turned, nor for the trick Zorchi 
had suggested. Here we couldn’t 
fire directly, but the bouncing 
shots worked almost as well. 
There were screams of men being 
hit, and the crazed pandemonium 
of others suddenly afraid. 

Shots came toward us, but the 
wall that protected them — or 
was supposed to — ruined their 
shooting. 



Zorchi abruptly dropped, land- 
ing with a thud on his side. I 
grunted sickly, thinking he was 
hit. 

Then I saw the sub-machine 
gun point squarely into the pas- 
sageway. It began spitting out 
death. By the time we could 
reach him, the expediters were 
dead or dying. There had been 
seven of them. 

Zorchi staggered into the pas- 
sage, through the bodies, crying 
something. I jumped after him, 
blinking my eyes to make out 
what he had seen. Then I caught 
sight of a door at the back being 
silently closed. It was a thick, 
massive slab, like the door to 
a bank vault. 

Zorchi made a final leap that 
brought a sob of anguish as he 
landed on his weak legs, but his 
gun barrel slapped into the slit 
of opening. The door ground 
against it, strained and stopped. 
Zorchi pulled the trigger briefly. 

F OR A SECOND, then, there 
was silence. A second later, 
Defoe’s voice came out through 
the thin slit. “You win. Dr. Law- 
ton and I are alone and unarmed. 
We’re coming out.” 

The door began opening again, 
somewhat jerkily this time. I 
watched it, expecting a trick, but 
there was none. 

Inside the vault, the first room 
was obviously for guards and for 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

the control of the equipment 
needed to wash all contamination 
out of the air and to provide the 
place with security for a century, 
even if all the rest of the Earth 
turned into a radioactive hell. 

Lawton was slumped beside 
the controls, his head cradled in 
his arms. But at the sight of us, 
he stood up groggily, his mouth 
open, and shock on his face. 

Defoe’s eyes widened a trifle, 
but he stood quietly, and the 
bleak smile never faltered. “Con- 
gratulations, Thomas,” he said. 
“My one fault again — I under- 
rated the opposition. I wasn’t ex- 
pecting miracles. Hello, Millen. 
Fancy meeting you here.” 

“Search the place,” I ordered. 

Carmody went past the two 
without looking at them, with 
Rena close behind. A minute 
later, I heard a triumphant shout. 
They came back with a cringing 
man who seemed totally unlike 
the genial Sam Gogarty who had 
first introduced me to fine food 
and to Rena. His eyes were on 
Carmody, and his skin was gray 
white. He started to babble in- 
coherently. 

Carmody grinned at him. 
“You’ve got things twisted, Go- 
garty. Tom Wills is in charge of 
this affair.” He turned toward one 
of the smaller offices. “As I re- 
member it, there should be a 
transmitting setup in here. I want 
to make sure it works. If it does, 

138 



some of the Underwriters are go- 
ing to get a surprise, unless 
they’re suspended.” 

Gogarty watched him go, and 
then sank slowly to a chair, shak- 
ing his head as he looked up at 
me. His lips twisted into bitter 
resignation. “You wouldn’t under- 
stand, Tom. All my life, worked 
for things. Class-C, digging in a 
mine, eating Class-D, getting no 
fun, so I could buy Class-B em- 
ployment. Then Class-A. Not 
many can do it, but I sweated it 
out. Thirty years living like a 
dog and killing myself with work 
and study. Not even a real 
woman until I met Susan, and 
she went to Defoe. But I wanted 
it easier for the young men. I 
wanted everybody to have a good 
life. No harm to anyone. Pull to- 
gether, and forget the tough 
times. Then you had to come 
and blow the roof off. .” 

I FELT SICK. It was probably 
all true, and few men could 
make it. But if that’s what it took 
to advance under the Company 
rules, it was justification enough 
for our fight. “You’ll be all right, 
Sam,” I told him. “You’ll go to 
sleep with the others. And when 
you wake up, you may have to 
work like hell again, but it’ll be 
to rebuild the Earth, not to ruin 
it. Maybe there’ll even be a 
chance with Susan again.” 

Defoe laughed sardonically. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Very nice, Thomas. And I sup- 
pose you mean it. What’s in the 
future for me?” 

“Suspension until the new gov- 
ernment gets organized and can 
decide your case. I’d like to vote 
now for permanent suspension.” 
His face lost some of his 
amusement. Then he shrugged. 
“All right, I suppose I knew that. 
But now will you satisfy my curi- 
osity? Just how did you work the 
business with Bay 100?” 

“What happened to Slovetski?” 
I asked. I couldn’t be sure about 
some of my suspicions over Bene- 
detto’s death, but I couldn’t take 
chances that the man might still 
be loose somewhere, or else hid-

“Sam?” I asked. 

Gogarty nodded slowly. “All 
right, Tom. I guess you’re the 
boss now. And I think I’m even 
glad of it. I always liked you. I’ll 
answer about Slovetski.” 

Defoe snarled and swung, then

spirators — including your 
father, Miss dell’Angela!” 

She gasped faintly, but her 
head came up at once. “Nikolas 
was no traitor. You’re lying!” 
“Why should I lie?” he asked. 
“With the right use of certain 
drugs, any man can become a 
traitor. And Dr. Lawton is an 
expert on drugs.” 

“Where is he?” I asked. 

He shrugged. “How should I 
know? He wanted a radioactive 
world, so I let him enjoy it. We 
put him outside just before we 
closed the doors permanently.” 
Gogarty nodded confirmation. 
I turned it over. He might even 
have been one of the men wait- 
ing outside. But it wouldn’t mat- 
ter. Without his organization and 
with a world where life outside 
was impossible, Slovetski’s power 
was finished. 

I turned to Zorchi. “The men 
who broke in will be going crazy 
soon,” I told him. “While Rena 
finds the paging system and re- 
assures them they’ll all be treated 
in the reception room, how about 
getting Lawton to locate and re- 
vive a couple of the doctors you 
know and trust?” 

T> ENA CAME back from the 
paging system, and Zorchi 
prodded Lawton with the gun, 
heading him toward the files that 
would show the location of the 
doctors. Gogarty stood up doubt- 

140 



fully, but I shook my head. Zorchi 
was able to handle a man of Law- 
ton’s type, even without full use 
of his legs, and I couldn’t trust 
Gogarty yet. 

“You can give me a hand with 
Defoe, Sam,” I suggested. “We’d 
better strap him down first.” 

Gogarty nodded, and then sud- 
denly let out a shocked cry, and 
was cringing back! 

In the split second when both 
Rena and I had looked away, 
Defoe had whipped out an auto- 
matic and was now covering us, 
his teeth exposed in a taut smile. 
“Never underestimate an oppo- 
nent, Thomas,” he said. “And 
never believe what he says. You 
should have searched me, you 
know.” 

The gun was centered on Rena, 
and he waited, as if expecting me 
to make some move. All I could 
do was stand there, cursing my- 
self. I’d thought of everything — 
except the obvious! 

Defoe backed toward the door 
and slipped around it, drawing 
its heavy weight slowly shut until 
only a crack showed. Then he 
laughed. “Give my love to Mil- 
len,” he said, and laughed softly. 

I jumped for the door, but his 
feet were already moving out of 
the passage. The door began 
opening again, but I knew it was 
too late. Then, it was open. And 
amazingly, Defoe stood not ten 
feet away. 

GALAXY SCIENCE'FICTION 



At the other end of the pas- 
sage, a ragged bloody figure was 
standing, swaying slowly from 
side to side, holding a rifle. I took 
a second look to recognize Niko- 
las Slovetski. He was moving 
slowly toward Defoe. And now 
Defoe jerked back and began 
frantically digging for the auto- 
matic he must have pocketed. 

Slovetski leaped, tossing the 
gun aside in a way that indicated 
it must have been empty. A bullet 
from Defoe’s automatic caught 
his shoulder in mid-leap, but it 
couldn’t stop him. He crashed 
squarely on Defoe, swinging a 
knife as the other went down. It 
missed, ringing against the hard 
floor. 



I’d come unfrozen by then. I 
kicked the knife aside and 
grabbed the gun from Defoe’s 
hands. Slovetski lay limp on him, 
and I rolled the smaller man 
aside. 

T~\EFOE WAS out cold from 
the blow of his head hitting 
the floor. Gogarty had come out 
behind me and now began bind- 
ing him up. He opened his eyes 
slowly, blinked, and tried to grin 
as he stared at the bonds. He 
swung his head to the figure on 
the floor beside him. “Shall we 
go quietly, Nikolas?” he asked, 
as Gogarty picked him up and 
carried him back to the private 
vault.

But his sarcasm was wasted 
on Slovetski. The man must have 
been dying as he stumbled and 
groped his way toward the place 
where he knew Defoe must be. 
And the bullet in the shoulder 
had finished him. Rena bent over 
him, a faint sob on her lips. 

Surprisingly, he fought his way 
back to consciousness, staring up 
at her. “Rena,” he said weakly. 
“Benedetto! I loved him. I — ” 
Then his head rolled toward me. 
“At least, I lived to die in a revo- 
lution, Thomas. Dirty business, 
revolution. When in the course 
of human events, it becomes — ” 
He died before he could finish. 
I went looking for Lawton, to 
make sure Defoe was suspended 
at once. He’d be the last political 
suspendee, if I had anything to 
do with it, but there would be a 
certain pleasure in watching Law- 
ton do the job. 

XIX 

T HE DOORS of the reception 
hall were closed again, but 
there was no lock now. One of 
the two doctors whom Zorchi had 
trusted was there now, waiting 
for the stragglers who came in 
slowly as a result of our broad- 
cast. We couldn’t reach them all, 
of course, but some could be 
saved. The men who had fought 
with us were treated and sus- 
pended. Even the boy and his 

•142 



dog had finally reached us and 
been put away. 

In the main room of the execu- 
tive vault, Carmody was waiting 
for Rena and me as we came in, 
haggard from lack of sleep, but 
somehow younger-looking than he 
had been since we had first re- 
vived him. 

He stood up, managing a tired 
smile. “The first work’s done, 
Tom,” he said. “It wasn’t too 
hard, once they learned Defoe 
was suspended; a lot of the others 
were afraid of him, I guess. So 
far, I’ve only contacted the ones 
I can trust, but it’s a beginning. 
I’ve gotten tapes of their delega- 
tion of authority to you as acting 
assistant Chief Underwriter. I 
guess the factor that influenced 
them most was your willingness 
to give up all hopes of suspen- 
sion for the emergency. And hav- 
ing Zorchi was a help, too — one 
man like him is worth an army 
now. I’ll introduce you tomor- 
row.” 

He stumbled out, heading to- 
ward the sleeping quarters. 

Well, I had the chance I’d 
wanted. And I had his promise 
to put off suspension until things 
were running properly. With time 
to develop a small staff, and with 
a chance to begin the work of 
locating the men to study the 
problems that had to be solved, 
I couldn’t ask for much more. 

Zorchi grinned at me. “Em- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



peror Weels!” he mocked. 

I grinned back. “If you ever 
say that seriously, Luigi, I want 
you to say it with a bullet through 
my brain. I’ve seen enough cases 
of power corrupting.” 

TT'OR A second, he studied me. 

“If that day should come, 
then there shall be the bullet. 
But now, even I must sleep,” he 
said. 

Then he glanced at Rena. 
“I have left orders that a priest 
should be wakened.” 

She colored faintly. 

“You’ll be best man, I sup- 
pose?” I asked. 

This time, even his beard 
couldn’t conceal his amusement. 
“Is Zorchi not always the best 
man?” he asked as he left us 
alone. 

I stared at the vault that would 
be my home for the next twenty- 
five or fifty years — until I was 
an old man, and the rest of the 
world was ready to be awakened. 
“It’s a lousy place to spend a 
honeymoon,” I told Rena. 

She leaned against me. “But 
perhaps a good place to bring up 
children,” she said. “A place to 
teach them that their children 
will have a good world, Tom. 
That’s all a woman ever wants, I 
guess.” 

I drew her to me. It was a 
good way to think of the future, 
whatever happened. And it would 



be a better world, where the vir- 
tues of the Company could be 
used. 

Probably it wouldn’t be per- 
fect. 

Even the best form of gov- 
ernment all the experts could 
devise couldn’t offer a permanent 
solution. But it could give men 
a chance; to fight their way to a 
still better world.

Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation. Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way, Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting."
