With this issue, IF is five years old, 
and the question that seems to have 
popped up most frequently during 
that time is one concerning its title. 
Some folks aver that IF isn’t the 
best title a science fiction magazine 
could have. Others express the 
opinion that it is a good title. Neu- 
trals ask: “Why did you call it IF?” 
At the 14th World Science Fic- 
tion Convention in New York the 
subject came up and one of the best 
known artists in the field remarked 
that IF had more science fiction 
“guts” than any other title. It was 
a flattering remark. Yet, with more 
truth than we realized at the time. 
For when you really think about it 
for a while, IF is science fiction! 
For instance, any science fiction 
story you read is really: “What 
would happen if — ?” A sound phi- 
losophy, a logical extrapolation and 
good writing provide the imaginary 
answer. An imaginary answer, a 
fictional answer — but an answer 
that gives us some of the most 
stimulating and entertaining read- 
ing we have today, reading that 



provokes thought and presents 
some fascinating new concepts 
about Mankind of the Future. 

Thus, we always come back to if. 
What would happen if — if the hu- 
man lifespan was increased to 150 
years, if the awesome power of 
nuclear fission got out of hand, if 
telepathy or electronics or seman- 
tics were ever developed to the ulti- 
mate, if space travel became an 
everyday event, if the integration of 
nationalities, languages, races, 
creeds and colors became a reality 
— if anyone of the myriad sciences 
were projected a hundred or thou- 
sand or million years into the 
future? 

Dr. Alan E. Nourse's PROGNOSIS 
FOR TOMORROW arrived just 
in time to make this issue. The 
theme is “medicine at the cross- 
roads” and it examines, in the light 
of progress of yesterday and today, 
the expectations of the future. We 
found it to be completely fascinat- 
ing, an article of equal interest to 
members of the medical profession 
as to lay readers. Don’t miss it . 
Henry Slesar, who makes his first 
appearance in these pages with 
THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW, 
is another who does science fiction 
in his spare time. A newcomer to 
the field and a young man just 
under thirty, he has been earning 
his living at the typewriter since 
he was 17 years old. With five years 
out for time in the Service, most of 
it has been writing advertising copy. 
At present he is vice president of a 
New York advertising agency and 
lives in Manhattan with his wife 
and daughter, a little girl almost 




two. He claims a collection of rec- 
ords that would be the envy of any 
jazz lover . Charles Fontenay 
(See October issue) recently made 
national news when he won first 
prize at a Nashville art exhibit — 
with a wipe rag for his brushes. 
When I wrote him about it, he re- 
plied: “It’s one of the funniest 
things that ever happened to me 
. The whole thing started when 
one of those Nashville abstract 
artists got control of a statewide 
exhibit here early this year, and 
threw out 150 of 250 paintings en- 
tered, leaving in only the abstracts. 
One of those thrown out was mine, 
and I didn’t get my entry fee back. 
I was painting something at the 
time, and slapped my excess paint 
on an old canvas and angrily told 
my wife, ‘That’s exactly the sort of 
stuff that gets blue ribbons now- 
adays. I’m going to enter that in 
the state fair and win first prize.’ 
I went through with it — and it 
did! . The abstract artists who 
infest Nashville are madder than 
hops, which tickles me no end.” 

Bryce Walton who has appeared 
often in IF (with HAPPY 
HERD, THE CHASM and 
others), is one of the most prolific 
writers in the general fiction field. 
To date he has two books, a hun- 
dred television shows, numerous 
articles, and over 500 short stories, 
novelettes and short novels to his 
credit. He writes under his own 
name (Bryce Walton) and 12 pen 
names. 

' Bom in a one-room farmhouse in 
an isolated section of Northwest 
Missouri, May 31, 1918, his only 



playmates until the age of nine 
were horses, cows, pigs, dogs, birds, ; 
chickens and snakes. He grew up 
in an imaginative world of his own 
in which he fantasied the animals 
as being people and vice versa. 
This confusion remains with him 
even today and, he says, con- 
tributes to his continuation as a 
writer. He does not feel that any 
character he has ever seen in the 
world of fiction, literary or other- 
wise, has but a faint resemblance 
to the people he meets in real life. 
He is convinced that fictional char- 
acters are created to carry out an 
author’s whims and are therefore 
understandable, but that real peo- 
ple are beyond comprehension. 

Mr. Walton attended public 
school in Kansas City, where he 
never succeeded in making a decent 
adjustment to his schoolmates as 
human beings, but always got to 
imagining them as friendly and 
sometimes not so friendly animals. 
After graduating from High School 
he stepped into the depression of 
the Thirties and spent several years 
bumming about the country on 
freight trains, and although at this 
time he had no idea of becoming a 
writer, he did all the things writers 
are supposed to have done — mi- 
grant fruit picker in Idaho and 
California, gold miner in Montana, 
carpenter, sign-painter, dishwasher, 
fry-cook, etc. He worked his way 
through Los Angeles City College 
as a school librarian for the Na- 
tional Youth Administration, and 
in 1941 he enlisted in the U. S. 
Navy. He became a writer when he 
wrote such a stirring portrait of the

Abbr. 



BY FRANK RILEY 



W alther Von Koenigsburg woke up a few mo- 
ments after the earth shuttle had passed Venus. 
As he gazed back at the lonely, shrouded planet, aban- 
doned long ago when Man won freedom to colonize 



5 




more habitable worlds in deep 
space, Walther realized that in just 
a matter of minutes his long pil- 
grimage would be over. Soon he 
would walk down the ramp and set 
foot on Earth — the almost mythi- 
cal homeland of his people. Wal- 
ther was young enough, and old 
enough, not to be ashamed of the 
sudden choking in his throat, the 
moisture in his eyes. 

A light touch on his shoulder 
brought him back to the shuttle 
ship. The pert stewardess smiled at 
his start. 

“Wyslgsr,” she asked pleasantly. 

Or at least that’s what it sounded 
like to Walther, whose ears were 
still ringing from the take off at the 
Cyngus III shuttleport. 

“I beg your pardon,” he began. 
“I’m afraid ...” 

For a moment she looked star- 
tled, then her full, red lips parted in 
another bright smile. 

“Oh, I’m sorry!” she exclaimed. 
“I didn’t realize ... I just asked, 
Sir, whether you had been sleep- 
ing” 

She spoke with the mechanical, 
stilted perfection he had first noted 
when transferring from the Aldeb- 
aran liner at the shuttleport. He 
had wondered, briefly, about the 
source of the accent, but had been 
too polite to ask. 

The stewardess put a small pil- 
low in his lap, then placed a tray 
on it. The recessed compartments 
of the tray held a cup of steaming 
black coffee, a piece of pastry that 
reminded Walther of apfelstrudel, 
and a paper-covered booklet en- 
titled: “Easy Earth Dictionary and 
Orientation Manual”. Stamped on 



the cover, in the manner of an offi- 
cial seal, were the words: “Pre- 
pared under the authorization of 
Happy Time, Ltd.” 

“Thank you,” said Walther, 
then he grinned buoyantly, eager 
to share these moments of excite- 
ment at being so close to Earth. 
“But I don’t think I’ll need the dic- 
tionary!” 

Tiny frown lines appeared be- 
tween the stewardess’s carefully 
arched eyebrows. 

“Hg su’v rthsr?” she inquired 
uncertainly. 

“I don’t understand . .” 

The stewardess managed a pro- 
fessional smile that was edged with 
just the faintest touch of impa- 
tience. 

“That’s what I thought. What I 
asked, Sir, was how long since 
you’ve been on Earth?” 

“This is my first visit!” 

“Then you had better study the 
dictionary,” she said firmly. 

“Oh, no, I really don’t need it!” 
Walther’s inner excitement showed 
in the flush of his fair Nordic com- 
plexion. He turned toward her in a 
burst of confidence. “You see, my 
people always kept alive their na- 
tive languages. My father’s side of 
the family was German . and 
down through all the generations 
they’ve managed to teach the lan- 
guage to their children! It was the 
same way with my mother’s family, 
who were English . .” Pride came 
into his voice : “I could speak both 
languages by the time I was four.” 
“And you’ve never taken this 
shuttle from Cyngus?” 

“I’ve never been on Cyngus be- 
fore — nor on Aldebaran VI — Den-

eb II — or Arcturus IX,” explained 
Walther, naming the farflung way 
station across the galaxy. He add- 
ed: ‘Tm on my way in from Neu- 
stadt — Andromeda, you know.” 

Respect replaced the hint of im- 
patience in the stewardess’s smile, 
which instantly became more per- 
sonal. Not for generations had a 
colonist from the Andromeda gal- 
axy boarded this shuttle; the An- 
dromeda run, across 1,500,000 light 
years of space, could be made only 
by special charter, at a fantastic 
cost. This blonde young man with 
the stubborn chin and sensitive 
mouth was obviously a colonial of 
tremendous wealth. 

The pilot’s buzzer sounded, and 
a red light flickered on the Pas- 
senger Instruction panel. 

“I have to go forward now,” the 
stewardess said, regretfully. “We’re 
entering the warp, and it’s time 
to prepare for landing. Maybe 
later ...” 

She let the invitation trail off, 
and left him with a very special 
smile. 

Walther understood the smile. 
He was a young man, but he was 
no fool. In the trading centers of 
Andromeda many women smiled 
at him that way when they learned 
he was a Von Koenigsburg from 
Neustadt. 

He dunked the pastry in the 
black coffee, took a generous bite 
and settled back to be alone with 
his thoughts. An earth woman was 
not an essential part of the dream 
that had taken him on this quixotic 
voyage. True, there might be a 
woman who would come to love 
him enough so that she would leave 

ABBR. 



the old world culture and gracious- 
ness of Earth for the colonial life 
on the immense frontier of An- 
dromeda. But, being of an age 
where the dreams of youth are 
merging with practicality, Walther 
rather doubted he would find such 
a woman. 

He didn’t doubt that the rest of 
his dream would come gloriously 
to life. 

While the shuttleship whirled 
without motion through the void- 
less void of hyper space, Walther 
smiled at the prospect ahead. Six 
months to immerse himself in the 
wonder of Earth’s culture! Six 
months to enjoy the whole of it, in- 
stead of nourishing the few precious 
fragments kept alive by his family 
through the first centuries of co- 
lonial life in the new galaxy. 

Delightful evenings at the sym- 
phony and the opera! Beethoven, 
Verdi, Brahms, Shubert and Wag- 
ner! Wagner! — Perhaps he would 
even be able to attend a perform- 
ance of Die Meistersinger. Walther 
smiled to himself. His great, great 
grandfather, who had first discov- 
ered the incredibly rich mines, for- 
ests and black loam of Neustadt, 
had started the tradition of naming 
the first son Walther, after the 
whimsical Meistersinger, Walther 
von der Vogelweide. 

Then there would be leisurely 
afternoons in the great libraries and 
museums! All the great classics of 
literature and art, instead of the 
few faded pictures and the handful 
of volumes in the high beamed li- 
brary of his family castle. The in- 
frequent ships that traveled be- 
tween the fringes of the two gal- 

7 




axies had little room for books and 
art treasures. Three years ago, on 
the occasion of Walther’s twenty- 
first birthday, his mother had bro- 
ken down in tears as she told of try- 
ing for half a decade to order a set 
of Goethe as a coming of age pres- 
ent for him. But after the request 
had finally reached Earth, some 
clerk had garbled the order and 
sent a four-page booklet that ap- 
parently was some kind of puzzle- 
book for children. 

Now he could steep himself in 
Goethe, Schiller, Dickens, Maupas- 
sant, Tolstoi! 

And best of all the conversation! 
The delicate art of communicating 
mind with mind! What tales he 
would have to tell when he sat 
again in the family banquet hall! 
How his mother V eyes would spar- 
kle! How his father would roar 
with delight as he recounted some 
rapier-like bon mot . 

But all this was only the small 
part of the dream. The small, per- 
sonal part. The dream itself was so 
much bigger, as big as a dream 
must be to carry over from youth 
to manhood. He had first dreamed 
it as a boy, sitting on the hearth 
rug with his knees tucked up under 
his chin, watching the great leap- 
ing fire, while behind him in the 
shadows his grandfather played on 
the old violin. Meditation , his 
grandfather had called it. By a long 
ago composer of Earth, a man 
strangely named Thais. His grand- 
father couldn’t play very much of 
it, but the fragment had lodged in 
Walther’s heart and would be 
there to the end of his life. 

Walther’s dream was indeed a 

8 



grand dream, shaped of a melody 
and leaping flames. He would not 
spend his lifetime wresting more 
wealth from the riches of Neustadt. 
That had been done for him; the 
challenge was gone. But someday he 
would make the journey to Earth, 
and bring back with him enough of 
the beauty and culture to make 
Neustadt a miniatum Earth, out on 
the rim of Andromeda. 

It was indeed a grand dream. 
He would spend his wealth for 
books and music and treasures of 
art. He would try to bring back 
artists and teachers, too, and from 
Neustadt would spread the wonder 
of the new, old culture; it would 
reach out to all the colonies of the 
Andromeda galaxy, giving texture 
to life. And it would be there like a 
shining beacon when Man made 
his next great step across space, 
across the millions of light years to 
the Camora galaxy, and beyond . 

The stewardess again touched his 
shoulder, with a gesture that was 
not entirely according to shuttle- 
ship regulations. 

“We’re through the warp and 
are now in orbit,” she said. “We’ll 
land at Uniport in three minutes.” 

Uniport! The fabled entry port 
of Earth! It was the new hub, the 
pulsing heart of the homeland. It 
was the syndrome of all Earth cul- 
ture, and its stratoways reached out 
like spokes of a spidery wheel to ev- 
ery city of the planet. 

Walther’s knees were a little 
shaky as he moved down the ramp, 
and the moisture in the corners of 
his eyes was not caused by the 
sleety December wind that whipped 
across the vast landing area. He 

FRANK RILEY 




was on Earth. He was the first of 
his people to returh to the father- 
land that had cradled them and 
sent them out into the universe. 

When the stewardess said good- 
by to him at the foot of the ramp, 
she looked both puzzled and disap- 
pointed. Her smile had been an in- 
vitation, and she had sensed the tug 
of it in his answering grin. But he 
only tipped his hat, and went on 
into the customs office. 

He felt like a small boy suddenly 
confronted by so many delights that 
he knew not which to sample first. 

“Destination?” 

The customs officer’s blue pencil 
poised over the question on the 
Uniport entry form. Walther 
shrugged carelessly. 

“Oh, Fll look around Uniport 
awhile, then visit other cities . 
New York . London . Vienna 
... I have six months, you know.” 

“I know — I’m sure you’ll enjoy 
your happy time. But you must 
have a destination — someplace 
where you can be contacted, or 
leave forwarding addresses.” The 
official’s voice was patient, but it 
had the curious mechanical quality 
Walther had noted in speech of the 
pretty young stewardess. 

“Can you recommend good lodg- 
ing?” 

“The Uniport landing provides 
excellent facilities, and you’ll be 
among other travelers until you 
have a chance to adjust yourself to 
happy time activities.” 

“Oh, no! I don’t want to waste a 
moment! I want to live among the 
people of Earth from this very first 
night!” 

ABBR. 



The customs officer peered at 
Walther’s entry permit. 

“Andromeda . that’s what I 
thought.” He shook his head dubi- 
ously. “You have your Orientation 
Manual?” 

Walther fumbled in the pockets 
of his greatcoat. 

“I must have left it on the shut- 
tleship, but I don’t need it.” 

The official pressed another copy 
of the manual firmly into Walther’s 
hands. 

“It is required,” he said. “First 
visitors are not allowed to leave 
the Uniport landing without one.” 

Walther was too happy to argue. 
He shoved the manual into one of 
pockets. 

“If I may suggest, Sir,” said the 
customs officer, his eyes widening 
as he looked over Walther’s letters 
of credit, “You will find the Hotel 
Altair most comfortable. It’s where 
all important visitors in Uniport 
stay.” 

The next few moments went by 
so quickly they left Walther a lit- 
tle dazed. A servo-robot took his 
bags and led him to a monorail car, 
which whisked him off to the hotel. 

“Gdegr,” said the doorman, an-, 
other servo-robot, in *a brilliant 
scarlet uniform. Its wax-like fea- 
tures were set in a perpetual smile. 

Walther blinked. 

“I’m sorry,” he began. “I — ” 

“Thayr,” said the majestic robot, 
taking Walther’s handtooled over- 
night bag and motioning imperi- 
ously for two bellhop robots td 
bring the rest of the luggage. Si- 
lent and smiling, they leaped to 
obey. 

The desk clerk was a human, and 

9 




greeted Walther with an efficient: 

“Wemtalr.” 

He offered Walther a pen and a 
registration card on which ap- 
peared some undecipherable com- 
bination of letters, 

Walther began to have a sense of 
unreality about the whole thing, as 
if he were still day-dreaming in the 
Venus warp. 

“Really,” he said, “I seem to be 
quite confused — ” 

With a smile of sudden compre- 
hension, the clerk produced a Man- 
ual and thumbed rapidly through 
its pages. He pointed to a phrase 
with the tip of his pen, and Walther 
read: 

What price room do you desire? 

Opposite these words was the 
phonetic jumble : 

Whprumuirer? 

Walther shrugged to indicate 
that price was not important, but 
his thoughts were spinning. And 
they were still spinning when the 
robot bellhop left him alone in his 
suite. The possibility of a language 
barrier on Earth was something he 
had never considered. With only 
six months planned for his visit, it 
would be impossible to learn a new 
language and still do all he had 
dreamed of doing. 

But the Von Koenigsburgs were 
noted for their stubbornness. Wal- 
ther’s chin set, and he opened the 
Manual to learn what this was all 
about. 

He promptly realized that this 
was a Manual only for the most ele- 
mentary needs of conversation, and 
that a great amount of study would 
be necessary for normal discourse. 
The first section of the Manual de- 

10 



voted a short chapter to each of 
the basic languages of Earth. Turn- 
ing from one to another, Walther 
discovered that an extreme degree 
of condensation had taken place in 
all languages. It was as though a 
form of speedwriting and short- 
hand had been vocalized. 

But why? What did it mean? 
Walther found a partial explana- 
tion in the Orientation section 
which began: 

“Be brief!” 

“Soyez bref!” 

“Mach 5 es kurz!” 

“Sea breze!” 

In a score of languages, first-time 
visitors were admonished that an 
understanding of these two words 
was essential to getting maximum 
enjoyment out of their stay on 
Earth. 

“Even in an earlier age,” the in- 
troduction pointed out, “the words 
‘Be Brief’ expressed the essence of a 
new way of life, a life in which pace 
and tempo were all important. 
Later, as technology and automa- 
tion relieved man of the burden of 
labor, he realized that tempo was 
equally important to fullest enjoy- 
ment of his happy time hours. You 
will understand this better after a 
few pleasant days on Earth.” 

There was a false ring to the 
words that heightened Walther’s 
sense of forboding. 

Under the glass top of his dress- 
ing table, he saw several brightly 
colored, attractively illustrated no- 
tices. One in particular caught his 
attention. It showed a young wom- 
an with lovely and poignantly ex- 
pressive features. Her hands were 
outstretched, as though she were 

FRANK RILEY 




singing or engaged in a dramatic 
scene. 

With the help of his Manual, 
Walther ascertained that the young 
woman was named Maria Piavi, 
and that she was an Italian operatic 
soprano appearing currently in 
Uniport with a New York com- 
pany. 

Walther’ s buoyancy began to re- 
turn. What better way to become 
acquainted with Earth’s culture 
than to spend his first evening at 
the opera? He removed the an- 
nouncement with Maria Piavi’ s pic- 
ture from under the glass and stood 
it upright against die mirror. 

Dinner in the hotel’s main dining 
room was a confusing interlude. 
The cuisine was superb, the robot 
waiter faultless — although Walther 
was beginning to weary of their 
fixed smiles. But more irritating was 
the flicker of huge, tri-dimensional 
television screens on the walls of the 
dining room. When he deciphered 
his bill, he saw he had been taxed 
for the TV entertainment. 

After dinner, he showed the 
opera announcement to the hotel 
clerk, and asked how to get there. 
The clerk wrote down the number 
of the monorail car he was to take, 
but when Walther learned the 
opera house was only six blocks 
away, he decided to walk. The clerk 
was aghast at this, and followed 
him all the way to the sidewalk, 
waving his arms and protesting in 
an hysterical jumble of consonants. 



T HE OPERA house itself was a 
revelation. All he had dreamed 
of, and more. The frescoed facade! 

ABBR. 



The dazzling marquee! The crowd 
of elegantly dressed men and wom- 
en, animatedly speaking their 
strange syllables as they watched a 
floor show in the lobby. When the 
floor show ended, and the crowd 
shifted to the far end, where a pan- 
tomimist was beginning his act, 
Walther had a clear view of the 
life-size cutout of Maria Piavi in 
the center of the lobby. 

He stood in front of it, staring 
with unashamed admiration. There 
was and earthiness and warmth 
about her that reminded him of the 
young women of his own planet. 
Paradoxically, there was also an air 
of remoteness and rigid self-disci- 
pline, a sense of emotion eternally 
controlled. He wondered which was 
the real Maria. Beside her picture 
was the photograph of a peppery 
old man whom Walther was able 
to identify as Willy Fritsh. The con- 
sonants under his name said he was 
now a producer, and had formerly 
directed for many years. 

Walther purchased his ticket 
without too much difficulty. The 
lights blinked, and he followed the 
crowd into the orchestra section. 

As he sank into the luxury of 
upholstered seat, Walther opened 
his senses to the sounds and sights 
about him, the tingling scent of the 
lovely women, the ebb and flow of 
indistinguishable conversation, the 
strange, short bursts of music which 
he found to be emanating from a 
tiny, jeweled radio in the purse of 
the woman who sat next to him. 

His excitement and anticipation 
grew still greater when he carefully 
deciphered the program and dis- 
covered that Maria Piavi was to 

11 




sing Gilda, in Rigoletto, this very 
evening. What unbelievable good 
luck! Rigoletto, to commemorate 
his first evening on Earth! Walther 
vaguely knew the story of the 
opera, but from earliest childhood 
he could remember his mother sing- 
ing snatches of Caro Nome and La 
donna e mobile . Now he would 
hear the entire arias, the full score 
of this masterpiece. 

Suddenly all was quiet. The 
orchestra rose swiftly into view in 
front of the stage. The white- 
haired leader bowed. There was an 
eruption of applause, as brief as the 
crack of a rocket breaking the 
sound barrier. The golden baton 
rose, a glorious burst of music filled 
the opera house and the velvet cur- 
tain zipped upward so rapidly that 
the blinking of an eye would have 
missed it. 

The opening scene of festal enter- 
tainment in the hall of the ducal 
palace was a masterpiece in con- 
ception, but the gay cavaliers and 
ladies, the Duke’s twenty-second 
condensation of the “Questa o 
quella” ballata, the plotting with 
Rigoletto and the mocking of Mon- 
terone were all accomplished and 
done with before Walther knew 
what was happening. 

Then he realized that he was 
looking upon a tremendous revolv- 
ing stage, divided into many exqui- 
site sets. Each set appeared majes- 
tically, established itself, often with 
an almost indiscernable pause, and 
then moved out of view to be re- 
placed by the next. 

The second scene was the de- 
serted street outside Rigoletto’s cot- 
tage. Rigoletto appeared and disap-

peared, Gilda and the disguised 
Duke flashed through their duets, 
the orchestra set up the briefest 
of fanfares, and the lovely Maria 
Piavi moved to the center of the 
stage to sing Gilda’s immortal aria 

“Caro nome che il me cor . 

The words electrified Walther to 
the edge of his seat. Here were the 
first naturally spoken words of the 
opera, the words of Gilda as she ex- 
pressed joy at learning the name of 
her lover. Walther’s mother had 
sung the haunting words on many 
an evening as he drifted off to sleep 
in his nursery. But he had never 
heard them phrased so beautifully 
as they came now from the lips of 
Maria Piavi. After the numbing 
shock of the first scene, they started 
the blood throbbing in his temples 
again. 

But they were the last words he 
understood of the aria. 

Using the archaic phrase with 
superb showmanship to startle her 
audience, Maria swung with flaw- 
less technique into a contraction of 
verse and music that somehow 
managed to convey the beauty of 
both in the few seconds that she 
held the center of the stage. It was 
like passing a star just before you 
entered hyperspace. You saw it for 
an instant, it awed and choked you 
with its wonder, and then it van- 
ished into a nothingness that was 
deeper than night. 

There was so much beauty in the 
fragment that Walther ached to 
hear the rest of the aria. But Gilda 
had been abducted to the Duke’s 
palace, and the stage had revolved 
far into Act II before Walther 
could assimilate the realization that

no more of “Caro Nome” would be 
heard this evening, or any evening. 

Nothing mattered after this, not 
even the Duke’s half-minute con- 
densation of “La donna e mobile 
The stage picked up momentum, 
thunder and lightning flashed, the 
murdered Gilda’s body was discov- 
ered by her father in the sack be- 
side the river, the final curtain 
swooped down over the grisly hor- 
ror, the orchestra disappeared, 
lights flashed on and Walther found 
himself being hurried along with 
the pleased audience toward the 
exit, where servo-robots were pass- 
ing out handbills and pointing to a 
theatre across the street. 

The entire opera had lasted 
eleven minutes. 

Stunned, his dream crumbling, 
Walther stood outside the opera 
house and watched the crowd dis- 
appear into the theatre across the 
street, or plunge into passing mon- 
orail cars. The wind of the late aft- 
ernoon was gone. A light snow was 
falling; it melted on his cheeks and 
powdered the fur collar of his great- 
coat. Some of the younger couples 
didn’t immediately board the mon- 
orail. They walked around to the 
stage exit and waited, laughing and 
chattering. Walther joined them. 

In a few moments members of 
the cast began to appear. They 
waved gaily at friends in the crowd. 

Maria came out in the company 
of two young men, followed closely 
by the peppery, bright-eyed little 
man whom Walther recognized 
from the lobby poster as being 
Willy Fritsh, the producer. The 
young couples closed around them,

applauding. Walther shouldered his 
way toward the center of the group. 

Maria was laughing with excite- 
ment. This was the warm, earthy 
Maria, not the exquisite, almost 
aloof, artist Walther had seen on 
the stage. She was a full-lipped, gay 
Italian girl who was enjoying the 
plaudits of her friends. She was 
bundled in a white fur, and her 
teeth flashed as she tossed back a 
rippling comment to one of the 
young men standing near Walther. 

As they started to move away, 
Walther stepped forward in sudden 
desperation. 

“I beg pardon,” he said. “Can 
you wait while I try to ask one 
question?” 

Maria looked startled, and one of 
her escorts stepped quickly between 
her and Walther. 

“Whtstywt?” the young man 
snapped. 

Walther flushed at the tone. He 
wasn’t used to being spoken to this 
way, certainly not by anyone his 
own age. His jaw set as he held on 
to his self control, and continued 
thumbing through the Manual. 

Then he noticed that Maria was 
being hurried along by her other es- 
cort. He tried to step around the 
young man blocking his path. 

The young man put out his arm 
and pushed against Walther’s 
shoulder, as if to shove him back 
into the crowd. 

Out of the corner of his eye, 
Walther saw Willy Fritsh hurrying 
forward to intervene. But his own 
reflexes were already in motion. His 
left hand flashed up; the back of it 
struck the young man in the chest. 
Walther didn’t intend it to be a 

13 




blow, merely a warning. He even 
managed to check it before it land- 
ed. But, to his bewilderment, the 
young man staggered back, slumped 
to his knees, gasping for breath. 

The other escort, though white- 
faced with fear, hurled himself at 
Walther. 

Still trying to maintain a measure 
of control, Walther merely blocked 
the second escort by thrusting out 
the palm of his hand. The young 
man toppled backward, and the 
whole scene began to take on a 
never-never land quality. 

Girls screamed in terror; the 
crowd around Walther scrambled 
out of his reach. Maria stared at 
him wide-eyed, but didn’t move. 

“I’m terribly sorry,” Walther 
blurted. 

There was a shrill whistle, a 
drumbeat of running feet on the 
cold sidewalk. Walther moved for- 
ward to help the young men to 
their feet. They shrank away from 
him, and then he was surrounded 
by three armed police officers, 
shouting a gibberish of commands. 

Finally, Willy Fritsh made him- 
self heard. He pointed to Walther’s 
manual, and spoke a few patient 
words of explanation. When one of 
the officers still seemed unsatisfied, 
Willy turned to Walther with a 
twinkle in his eyes: 

“They want to know if you are a 
professional pugilist?” 

Walther felt immeasureably re- 
lieved at hearing these naturally 
spoken words. 

“Good Lord, no!” he gasped. 

He took out his entry permits, his 
identification certificate and his 
letters of credit, impressively drawn 

14 



up on the stationery of the Inter- 
Galactic Exchange Union on Den- 
eb II. 

When the doubting officer saw 
the amount of the credits, his hands 
shook and he handed the papers 
back to Walther as if they were 
state documents. The officers 
helped the two young men to their 
feet, admonished them sharply, 
tipped their hats to Walther and 
hurried back to their posts. 

Willy regarded Walther quizz- 
ically. 

“Well, young man, you seem to 
have very persuasive ways!” 

At home, it had been easy for 
Walther to slip from English to 
German. He did it now in the stress 
of the moment. 

“Ich kann Ihnen nicht sagen wie 
leid es mir tut — ■” 

He was in the middle of his apol- 
ogy before he realized he was talk- 
ing German. He broke off in con- 
fusion. Willy’s pink cheeks crinkled 
with amusement. 

“1st schon gut. Ich spreche auch 
das ‘alte’ Deutsch.” 

Willy went on to explain : 

“As a young man I translated 
many of the German masters into 
our modern happy time presenta- 
tions. Now, what is it you wanted to 
ask Miss Maria?” 

Walther addressed his question to 
Willy, but he looked at Maria as he 
spoke: 

“I ... I wanted to ask if she 
would ever consider singing Rigo- 
letto in its original form. I would 
be happy to pay all expenses . 

“I’m sure you would,” Willy said 
drily. “But Miss Maria sings only 
the pure happy time essence of 

FRANK RILEY 




Rigoletto. Not for more than a cen- 
tury has Verdi’s original version 
been sung on Earth.” 

Maria looked puzzled during the 
interchange. Willy translated for 
her, and she nodded in vigorous en- 
dorsement of his words. There was 
a titter of laughter from the young 
couples who had crowded around 
them again. 

Walther drew himself very erect. 

“Thank you,” he said. 

He turned on his heel and 
walked into the darkness beyond 
the stage exit. He walked blindly 
into the snow flurries, not caring 
where his steps were taking him. 
But he had not gone two hundred 
yards before he realized he was be- 
ing followed. 



W ALTHER STOPPED and 
waited. 

The footsteps behind him drew 
closer. A slight shadow bulked out 
of the darkness, and Walther heard 
Willy Fritsh say in German: 
“Don’t be alarmed, young man.” 
Willy came up and linked his 
arm through Walther’s. 

“Keep on walking — It’s a cold 
night.” 

The chill air rattled in Willy’s 
throat as he panted from the pace 
of overtaking Walther. When he 
caught his breath, he asked: 

“What sort of world do you come 
from? It’s quite amazing that some- 
one from the Andromeda galaxy 
should ask for the original Rigo- 
letto!” 

Walther told the old producer 
something of his home and family. 
Willy questioned him closely on sev- 

ABBR. 



eral points, and finally seemed satis- 
fied. 

“When they come from the 
stars,” he murmured. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“It is nothing — just the title of 
an old classic.” 

At the next corner, Willy stopped. 
“I leave you here.” 

He stepped closer to Walther and 
lowered his voice, even though 
there was nothing around them but 
darkness and drifting snow. 

“Would you care to sample a 
bit of Bohemia, my boy?” 

“Well — I guess so,” Walther an- 
swered doubtfully. 

“Tomorrow evening then, at 
eight. 1400 Avenue B, apartment 
21. Can you remember that?” 

“1400 Avenue B, apartment 21.” 
“I must emphasize the need for 
discretion on your part. There will 
be important people present.” 
“Why do you trust me?” Walther 
challenged. 

“Because I am an old fool,” 
chuckled Willy Fritsh. 

The chuckle emboldened Wal- 
ther to ask one more question: 
“Will Maria be there?” 

“Now you are a fool!” 

Willy took a step away, then re- 
turned, flicked on his cigarette 
lighter and studied Walther 
thoughtfully. 

“Or maybe not,” he murmured. 
“Maybe not. Perhaps Maria could 
be there, this once . .” 

He snapped out the lighter. 

With another chuckle, Willy dis- 
appeared into the darkness. 

1400 Avenue B, apartment 21. 
Eight o’clock tomorrow evening. 
The directions whirled all night 

15 




through Walther’s fitful sleep. They 
intermingled with a strange com- 
pany of servo-robots, unintelligible 
phrases, the dry chuckle of Willy 
Fritsh and the haunting voice of 
Maria Piavi, beginning an aria she 
would never finish. 

The next day, Walther deter- 
mined to find out how the cult of 
brevity had changed other fields of 
Earth’s culture. He went first to the 
library, where foreboding hardened 
into bitter reality. Classic after clas- 
sic was cut to its essence. Hamlet 
was reduced to a total reading time 
of seven minutes. But the old li- 
brarian seemed embarrassed about 
this. 

By mutual reference to the Man- 
ual, she managed to convey to him 
that a new edition would be out 
soon, and that it would be edited 
down to five minutes reading time. 
Did he want to sign up for a copy? 

Walther gave her a stricken look, 
and silently shook his head. 

Puzzled, she led him to the other 
classics on his list. Each was a new 
blow. “Great Expectations” was 
cut to twenty pages, all of Thoreau 
to one thin pamphlet, Henry James 
to a pocket-size digest of less than 
ten pages; “Leaves of Grass” to a 
few lines of verse. 

Walther’s sense of loss became 
more than personal. He saw un- 
counted generations of boys who 
would never know Whitman, who 
might never have time for the open 
road in the Spring, the sweet 
springtime of life. The road and 
the poem, they were part of each 
other. Without one, the other could 
not live. 

The fire of Walther’s dream 



flamed up fiercely within him. 
There was yet time for beauty in 
Andromeda. Time for quiet and 
thinking and true leisure. Some- 
how, he must rescue the treasures of 
the ages from the tomb of Earth 
and let them live again, three-quar- 
ters of a million light years away. 

He beckoned to the old librarian, 
and laboriously communicated his 
question : 

“The originals of these classics — 
where are they?” 

She frowned in bewilderment. 
He pointed to the proper words 
again, and gestured with his hands 
to indicate a large book. 

A smile of understanding re- 
placed her frown. She consulted a 
larger edition of his own Manual, 
and wrote: 

Digester’s Vaults — lower six 

levels. 

He wrote back : 

Can I go down there? 

After some delay, she encoded 
the answer: 

Only authorized happy time Di- 
gesters are permitted in the vaults. 

Walther thanked her glumly. His 
spirits were so depressed that not 
even the digested version of the 
Bible shocked him too greatly. The 
Old Testament amounted to eleven 
pages, in rather large type ; the Gos- 
pel of St. Mark was three para- 
graphs; the Acts of the Apostles 
spanned less than half a page. 

Walther left the library, and the 
icy wind roused him from depres- 
sion. It lashed him to anger, to a 
desperate, unreasoning anger that 
drove him to find, somewhere on 
Earth, an ember of the old culture. 
Somewhere he had to find such an 



16

ember and bring it back to Neu- 
stadt, where it would flame again. 

He managed to get directions to 
the Vienna stratowaycar. Surely in 
Vienna he would find some trace of 
the spirit left by Mozart and Hay- 
den, Beethoven, Schubert and 
Strauss. 

Ten minutes later, when he left 
the stratoway in the Platz terminal 
near the Vienna Ring, his heart 
beat a little faster. This was indeed 
the old Vienna, as he had envis- 
aged it from the few pictures he 
had seen and the many stories he 
had been told. The buildings on the 
Ring were in good repair, and not 
substantially altered. There was the 
Burg Theatre, the Art and History 
Museum, the buttressed facade of 
the ancient Opera House, the soar- 
ing twin spires of the Votive 
Church. It was like seeing an old 
woodcut come to life. 

But, for Walther, that was all 
that came to life in Vienna. The 
Burg Theatre was currently pre- 
senting Faust, in what was billed as 
a brilliant new production scaled 
down to seventeen minutes. Wal- 
ther sadly recalled Goethe’s pro- 
phetic line: Mein Lied ertont der 
unbekaten Menge . My song 
sounds to the unknown multitude. 

Wandering outside the city itself, 
into the footpaths of the Wiener- 
wald, Walther tried to lose himself 
among the gentle slopes and the old 
trees that cut latticework into the 
sky. He came suddenly upon the 
village of Tullnerzing, where, from 
a tiny sidewalk cafe, music of a 
stringed ensemble came in short, 
quick bursts. It was scherzo speeded 
up a hundredfold, with not three 

ABBR. 



but an infinite number of quarter 
notes blurred into what sounded 
like a single beat. 

These were the Vienna woods! 
How could he ever tell his mother 
and father? Heartsick, he returned 
to the Platz and found the Berlin 
stratoway. 

In Berlin, his bitterness grew. He 
had known the Unter den Linden 
must have changed through the 
centuries, but he was not prepared 
for such a pace of life, such a frenzy 
of leisure. Better not to have left 
Andromeda. Better always to have 
lived with a dream. 

The sight of two elderly burghers 
drinking beer reminded him of his 
own great grandfather, and gave 
him a heartening twinge of nostal- 
gia. But as he stepped close to their 
table, he saw that as they sipped 
from their miniature steins the fin- 
gers of their free hands beat out a 
rhythmic accompaniment to the 
convolutions of an adagio team 
imaged on the table-top television 
screen. 

The final irony came to him 
when he read the lines of Schiller, 
carved over the entrance to a mu- 
seum near the Brandenburg Gate. 
Because they were cut deep into the 
old stone, they could not be erased 
or condensed. They were there to 
give their ironic message to a world 
that could no longer read them : 
Only through the morning gate- 
way of the beautiful did you enter 
the land of knowledge. 

And beneath them was Schiller’s 
immortal warning to the artist: 

Der Menschheit Wurde ist in 
eure Hand gegeben , 

Bewahret sie . 

17 




Walther copied the entire pas- 
sage on the back of his Manual. 
This, at least, he could take back 
with him. These words he could 
preserve for the artists who would 
someday create their works of 
beauty on the frontier of An- 
dromeda. As he copied them, Wal- 
ther felt that the words were also a 
personal message from Schiller to 
himself: 

The dignity of Mankind is placed 
in your hands , 

Preserve it! 

Whether it sinks or rises depends 
on you . 

The holy spell of poetry 

Serves a wise world order; 

May it guide man to that great 
sea 

Where harmony prevails. 

The words sustained Walther’s 
spirits until he left the stratoway in 
Paris and went to the Louvre. He 
had told himself that by this time 
nothing could shock him, that he 
could take any blow. But the 
Louvre was a new shock all over 
again. 

Translating a title with the help 
of his Manual and the servo-robot 
guide, Walther found that the thin, 
wavering line, about two inches 
long, against a background of misty 
blue, was the Mona Lisa. 

The servo-robot explained, after 
much searching among its tapes 
for words: 

“This is the spirit of the famous 
Mona Lisa smile. The Happy Time 
artist has cleverly removed all non- 
essential detail so that you can get 
the meaning of the picture in the 
minimum amount of time.” 

Walther studied the thin, waver- 

18 



ing line. This, then, was Da Vinci’s 
eternal enigma of womanhood. Per- 
haps it explained why he felt there 
were two Marias. Could there be 
one whole woman in a culture of 
fragmented lives? 

The portraits of Holbein were re- 
duced to a few sprinkles of geo- 
metric designs shot through with a 
single brilliant color. The nudes of 
Watteau, Rubens and Velazquez 
were little more than shadow 
curves. 

In the east wing of the Louvre, 
the servo-robot pointed to a series 
of larger paintings. Each of these, 
Walther learned, summarized the 
entire life work of a single artist. 
Here it was possible to see all of 
Titian or Michaelangelo or Van 
Gogh on one simplified canvas. 

Where were the originals of these 
classics? In the cultural vaults at 
Uniport, the servo-robot explained. 
Only authorized Happy Time art- 
ists could work with them. 

Afterwards, Walther was never 
quite certain what happened to the 
rest of his day. Distraught, he wan- 
dered around the Earth, changing 
from stratoway to stratoway, scarce- 
ly paying any heed to his next des- 
tination. Rome, Athens, Moscow, 
Jerusalem. Everywhere the pace of 
leisure was the same. Capetown, 
New Delhi, Tibet, Tokyo, San 
Francisco. Everywhere he saw 
something that crumbled his dream 
a little more: The Buddhist monk 
pausing for ten seconds of medita- 
tion while he counted his beads, not 
one by one but in groups of twenty; 
the World Government Chamber 
where the Senator from the United 
States filibustered a proposal to 

FRANK RILEY 




death by speaking for the unprece- 
dented period of four minutes; the 
cafe near the school where teenage 
boys and girls, immense numbers of 
them, danced, snapped their fingers 
and shrieked ecstatically as the lat- 
est popular record exploded in a 
wild three-note burst of sound. 

It was seven o’clock in the eve- 
ning before Walther became aware 
of the time. He was half the Earth 
and just one hour away from his 
meeting with Willy Fritsh. 

1400 Avenue B, apartment 21. 

A bit of Bohemia, Willy had 
promised him. The words disturbed 
Walther. He had been disappoint- 
ed so often in his twenty-four hours 
on Earth that he didn’t feel like 
bracing himself for another let- 
down. Nor did he feel in the mood 
for a gay evening, if that was what 
Willy had meant. 

Would Maria be there? 

Walther shook his head angrily. 
He was indeed a fool if he expected 
anything after this day. 



1 400 AVENUE B was only a few 
moments by monorail from the 
Hotel Altair. A gentle-faced woman 
who reminded Walther of his own 
mother answered his knock on the 
door of Apartment 21. 

“Kdftc?” she inquired politely. 
Walther stared at her. Was this 
all a cruel joke played by Willy 
Fritsh? Certainly this elderly wom- 
an, this quiet building, contained 
no Bohemia to be spoken of with 
discretion. 

“Excuse me,” he muttered, not 
even bothering to consult his Man- 
ual. He bowed and backed away. 

ABBR. 



“I’m afraid I’ve made a mistake — ” 

She stayed him with a small ges- 
ture of her delicate fingers. Glanc- 
ing swiftly up and down the hall, 
she beckoned him inside. When the 
door was closed, she smiled a bright 
welcome, and spoke in the old 
tongue : 

“You’re the young man from An- 
dromeda!” 

Walther felt the tension inside 
him beginning to relax. He nodded, 
and she took his arm. 

“Willy told us — we’ve been ex- 
pecting you.” 

She led him from the small foyer 
into a large, tastefully furnished liv- 
ing room. Walther glanced around 
uncertainly, but his first impression 
proved correct. There was no one 
else here. 

The woman urged him forward 
with a light touch of her fingertips. 

“We must be so careful,” she 
murmured. 

She guided him through the liv- 
ing room, past the kitchen and one 
bedroom, and then opened the door 
of what appeared to be the en- 
trance to a second bedroom. 

This room was unexpectedly 
large, and contained many people. 
They were talking with great ani- 
mation, but hushed abruptly as he 
entered. 

“The young man from An- 
dromeda,” his hostess announced. 

The dry voice of Willy Fritsh 
came through the haze of cigarette 
smoke. 

“Over here, boy! Come and sit 
down!” 

He saw Willy and Maria sitting 
on a long cushion against the far 
wall. They moved over to make 

19 




room for him. Maria smiled rather 
hesitantly. He sensed she was very 
ill at ease. 

‘‘I’ll introduce you around later,” 
said Willy. “Everybody’s too keyed 
up right now. We’ve just had an 
unexpected surprise — really quite 
startling.” 

The conversation had bubbled 
up again, and there was an electric 
feeling of excitement in the air. 
Everyone was trying to talk at the 
same time. Cheeks were flushed, 
eyes sparkled. 

While everyone was talking to 
those nearest, the most constantly 
recurring focal point of attention 
was the thin, balding man seated 
just across the room from Walther, 
on the arm of the sofa. He was 
riffling the pages of a pocket-size 
notebook and smiling with self- 
conscious pride. 

Willy nodded toward the man. 
“There’s the gentleman who fur- 
nished our surprise — He brought 
shorthand notes on an entire chap- 
ter from Don Quixote!” 

After the day he had just been 
through, Walther could appreciate 
this. He asked wonderingly, 
“Where did he get them?” 

“He’s a Happy Time Digester.” 
Walther studied the little man. 
So this was one of the comparative 
few on Earth who could get into 
the deep vaults of the Uniport li- 
brary! What wonders he must have 
explored! What beauty and adven- 
ture, what mind-stretching thoughts 
he must encounter in those under- 
ground catacombs. How deep into 
die past he could explore, how far 
into the future! Why, he could 
range the universe faster than the 

20 



warp drive, out even beyond the 
Andromeda galaxy! 

Willy cut into his thoughts. 

“He’s going to read the entire 
chapter!” 

Walther turned to Maria to see 
if she shared his excitement. It was 
the aloof, controlled Maria who 
smiled faintly at him. It was obvi- 
ous she had come against her will, 
and was trying to be gracious about 
it. 

A middle-aged couple arrived. 

“Dr. and Mrs. Althuss,” Willy 
whispered. “He’s the famous heart 
surgeon . .” 

The next arrival was a distin- 
guished looking man whose fingers 
shook with nervousness. 

“That’s the World Government 
alternate delegate from England,” 
Willy whispered again. “It wouldn’t 
do his reputation any good for 
word to get out that he spent 
an evening in this Bohemian 
crowd . .” 

Their hostess moved to the cen- 
ter of the room, raised her hand 
and announced: 

“We’re all here now. Please go 
ahead, Lome.” 

The room quieted instantly. The 
thin little man proudly began in the 
old English: 

“Don Cervante at the Castle . .” 

His reading was painfully slow, 
and he stumbled over the pronun- 
ciation of many words. The people 
in the room watched him so in- 
tensely, with such absolute concen- 
tration, that they gave the impres- 
sion of reading his lips rather than 
listening to his words. Frequently, 
he would have to translate a word 
or phrase into the new language, 

FRANK RILEY 




and there would be nods of under- 
standing and relief. 

Willy’s bright blue eyes sparkled 
more brightly than ever. He ran his 
fingers constantly through his thin 
bristle of white hair. The elderly 
woman on the sofa beside the Di- 
gester was so flushed and breathing 
so rapidly that Walther feared she 
was on the verge of a stroke. Even 
the urbane heart surgeon showed 
the emotional impact of this ex- 
perience. His long, tapered fingers 
were clenched together, and he ran 
his under lip constantly over the 
edge of his greying mustache. 

Maria seemed the only one in the 
room who was not affected by the 
reading. Only a slight tightening of 
her lips marred her careful com- 
posure. 

Soon Walther lost himself in the 
tingling excitement of the room, 
and he forgot about watching the 
others. Word by word, sentence by 
sentence, the Digester led them 
along with Don Cervante. 

The reading, with its many 
pauses for translation, took almost 
two hours. When it was over, every- 
one was emotionally and physically 
exhausted. The little Digester was 
so pale he looked ill; his high fore- 
head dripped with perspiration. 

Walther drew a long breath, and 
brought himself reluctantly back to 
reality. 

Willy asked quietly: 

“What do you think of our intel- 
lectual underworld?” 

An outbreak of almost hysterical 
conversation made it useless for 
Walther to answer. Maria, with a 
look of reproach at Willy, moved 
across the room to speak to their 

ABBR. 



hostess. Willy lit one of his cigars 
and leaned closer to Walther. 
There was a gleam of amusement 
in his twinkling blue eyes. 

“You look more worn out than 
Don Cervante!” he chuckled. 

The contrast between this eve- 
ning and the disillusionment of the 
day made it hard for Walther to 
put his gratitude into words. 

“I can’t thank you enough — ” he 
began. 

“Don’t try,” said Willy. “I may 
have had my own devious reasons 
for inviting you.” He glanced to- 
ward Maria, who was making an 
effort at polite conversation with 
the hostess. “I’m afraid our young 
diva isn’t an ardent admirer of the 
unexpurgated Don Quixote” 

There were many questions Wal- 
ther wanted to ask about Maria, 
but he tactfully inquired, instead: 

“How often does this group 
meet?” 

“Whenever there is something to 
share — a chapter of literature — a 
copy of an old painting — a record- 
ing. It all depends on what our few 
Digester friends can manage — 
They don’t have an easy time of it, 
you know.” 

“Is it difficult for them to take 
things out of the vaults?” 

“Difficult . and dangerous,” 
Willy answered grimly. 

“But why . .?” 

For reasons that make good sense, 
officially at least. A culture found- 
ed on brevity cannot be expected to 
encourage its own demise through 
the acts of its civil servants! Think 
what could happen: A total work 
of art, whatever its form, takes time 
to appreciate! But if people spend 

21 




too long at an opera, the legitimate 
theatre or the television industry 
would be slighted! If they paused 
too long in contemplation of a 
painting, newspapers might not be 
purchased! If they dawdled over 
the old-style newspaper, the digest 
magazines, the popular recordings, 
the minute movies, the spectator 
sports — the thousand and one forms 
of mass recreation offered the pub- 
lic — each in turn would suffer from 
unrestrained competition!” 

“It’s inconceivable,” Walther 
protested, “that entertainment in- 
terests could be strong enough to 
shape a culture! Surely the produc- 
tive basis of Earth’s economy . 

Willy snorted. 

“My boy, work as such may still 
be important in Andromeda, but 
how could it possibly be so here on 
Earth? Generations ago, automa- 
tion, the control of the atom, the 
harnessing of the sun’s energy — all 
combined with many other factors 
to make work a negligible part of 
Man’s existence! Thus, with four- 
fifths of his waking hours devoted to 
leisure-time pursuits, the balance of 
power shifted inevitably to the pur- 
veyors of mass entertainment. Great 
monopolies, operating under the 
Happy Time, Ltd. cartel, seized 
upon the digest trend in the old cul- 
ture and made brevity the basis of 
the new order. The briefer you 
make a piece of entertainment, the 
more pieces you can sell the public 
in a given number of leisure hours! 
It’s just good business,” Willy con- 
cluded drily. 

Walther was silent a moment, 
trying to frame this picture in his 
thoughts. But there were so many 

22 



missing elements. 

“Your artists and writers,” he 
demanded, “all your creative peo- 
ple — don’t they have anything to 
say about it?” 

“Damn little. You see, the suc- 
cessful artist — whatever his field — 
is well paid by his particular mo- 
nopoly. Besides, he’s been trained 
in the new form! I doubt if Maria 
has ever seen the original score of 
an opera — let alone tried to sing an 
entire aria!” 

Willy took a glass of wine from a 
tray offered by the hostess’s servo- 
robot. He motioned to Walther to 
help himself, but Walther shook his 
head. Another question was trou- 
bling him. 

“Why do the monopolies even 
bother with Digesters and the clas- 
sics? Why not let modem artists 
create in the new form?” 

Willy’s voice grew hard. 

“Because,” he snapped, “there 
have been no creative artists on 
Earth for over a century! Why 
create when your creation is only 
fed into the maw of the Digesters? 
That which is not wanted dies — in 
a culture as well as in the human 
body! That — my young friend from 
Andromeda — is the bitter tragedy 
of it all!” 

Maria rejoined them, and whis- 
pered something to Willy. The old 
producer sighed and turned to 
Walther. 

“Maria would like to leave now. 
Will you take her back to our ho- 
tel? There are some people here I 
must see . .” 

“Of course!” 

Yet, in spite of his eagerness to 
get better acquainted with Maria, 

FRANK RILEY 




Walther was reluctant to leave. 
There was so much more he want- 
ed to ask, to learn. And deep be- 
neath the surface of his thoughts a 
bold idea was beginning to form. 

As if reading his mind, Willy 
said: 

“We have no performance to- 
morrow afternoon. Gome and see 
me at our hotel — we’ll talk further! 
Meanwhile — •” Willy’s blue eyes 
sparkled again, “Meanwhile, for 
the young, the evening is still 
young. It should be an interesting 
challenge!” 

Maria said nothing until they 
had left the apartment building 
and started across the street to the 
monorail station. Then she stopped, 
drew a long breath of the wintry 
air, and shook her head. 

“Whtrblvng!” she exclaimed. 

She smiled at his puzzled expres- 
sion and tucked her arm through 
his. When they were inside the sta- 
tion, he handed her his Manual. 
She flipped through the pages, but 
could not find the exact translation 
of her remark. Finally, she picked 
out parts of three phrases. Put to- 
gether, they read: 

“What a terrible evening!” 

After the first shock of her words, 
Walther realized he could expect 
her to feel no differently. She was 
a product of her culture, and evi- 
dently this had been her first visit 
to Willy’s Bohemia. 

It was past midnight when they 
boarded the monorail, and they 
were alone in the car. Fumbling in 
her purse for a coin, Maria pointed 
to the small screen on the back of 
the seat in front of them. Walther 

ABBR. 



offered a handful of coins. She put 
one into the slot beside the screen. 
A comedy sequence appeared, last- 
ing for approximately thirty sec- 
onds. Much of it was lost to Wal- 
ther, because he couldn’t under- 
stand the dialogue. But Maria 
laughed gaily. The tension lines, 
the outward evidences of inner 
emotional control, began to smooth 
away. Her cheeks flushed ; her dark 
eyes began to sparkle. This was the 
Maria Walther felt he could learn 
to know. 

When the television screen went 
dark, Maria promptly put another 
coin into a slot beside a small grid. 
A full-scale orchestra sounded what 
might have been the first chord of 
a symphony, but the piece was over 
before Walther could identify it. A 
third coin, dropped into the arm of 
the seat, produced a small two-page 
magazine, which seemed to consist 
chiefly of pictures. One of the pic- 
tures showed Maria herself, in op- 
eratic costume. She studied it crit- 
ically, then tossed the magazine into 
a handy receptacle under the seat. 
A fourth coin brought out a game 
from the side of the monorail car. 
It vaguely resembled a checker- 
board, except that there were only 
six squares and two magnetized 
checkers. Maria guided his hand 
while he made two moves. As she 
completed her last move, the board 
automatically folded back into the 
side of the car. A fifth coin sum- 
moned a miniature keyboard from 
just beneath the television screen. 
Maria touched the keys, producing 
tinkling noises that sounded like a 
tiny celeste. Then the keyboard 
zipped back into its enclosure. 

23 




Maria reached for a sixth coin. 
Walther closed his hand over hers, 
and made a motion to indicate that 
his head was already in a whirl. She 
laughed, but didn’t try to remove 
her hand. A moment later the mon- 
orail stopped in front of their ho- 
tel. 

As they crossed the lobby, Wal- 
ther pointed inquiringly toward the 
cocktail lounge. Maria smiled and 
nodded gaily. 

A servo-robot waiter seated them 
at a small chrome table beside a 
tiny dance floor. Maria ordered 
their drinks, and the waiter was 
back with them in a matter of sec- 
onds. The glasses seemed extremely 
small to Walther, compared to the 
huge mugs and steins he was accus- 
tomed to on Neustadt. The liquor 
tasted rather bland, more like a 
sweet wine than a whiskey. 

The servo-robot presented a bill 
with the drinks. Money had never 
meant anything to Walther, but he 
could scarcely repress a start when 
he deciphered the amount of the 
bill. By any standard of wealth or 
exchange, the drinks were fantas- 
tically expensive. 

A scattering of applause an- 
nounced the return of the orches- 
tra. Maria held out her hand in an 
invitation to Walther. With some 
misgivings, he led her out on the 
dance floor. She turned and came 
into his arms so naturally and sud- 
denly that she almost took his 
breath away. She danced very close 
to him. Her cheek was warm, and 
the faint perfume from the tip of 
her ear was something he would 
have liked to explore more thor- 
oughly. But the moment was over 



before it began. The music stopped, 
the orchestra leader bowed and led 
his men from the stage. 

Back at the table, Walther lifted 
his glass to suggest another drink. 
She shook her head, explaining, 
“Olndrptd.” 

Spelled out with his Manual, her 
explanation was: 

“Only one drink is permitted.” 
And, after Willy’s brief orienta- 
tion, this was understandable : 
Nothing could disrupt the perpet- 
ual entertainment cycles more eas- 
ily than excessive drinking. A tipsy 
person was not a good customer for 
other leisure-time activities. There- 
fore, permit only one drink to a 
person, and charge enough for it so 
that the liquor monopoly would get 
its fair share of the entertainment 
expenditure. As Willy would say, it 
was just good business. 

Maria touched his hand to signi- 
fy it was time to leave. Walther 
took her up to her room on the 
32nd floor, and they watched two 
musical comedies en route on the 
elevator pay-as-you-see television 
screen. 

In front of her door, Maria light- 
ly touched the back of his hand 
with her fingertips. She said, 
“Thyfrwrdrftm.” 

Walther knew she was thanking 
him, but from force of newly-ac- 
quired habit he reached for his 
Manual. 

She laughed, shook her head and 
translated her own words by rais- 
ing up on tiptoe and brushing his 
lips with her own. 

Their lips were together so brief- 
ly that Walther wasn’t sure whether 
he had really kissed her. He reached 



24 




out to take her in his arms and 
make sure of it. 

Deftly, she turned away and 
closed her door behind her. 



M ANY THOUGHTS interfered 
with Walther’s second night 
of sleep on Earth, and they weren’t 
only of Maria. In fact, as his idea 
took form, even the scent of her 
perfume and the moth-like touch 
of her lips were forced temporarily 
into the background of his con- 
sciousness. 

The next morning he waited im- 
patiently for an hour after break- 
fast, then went up to Willy’s room. 
Willy came to the door in his dress- 
ing robe, holding his glasses in one 
hand and a sheet of music in the 
other. He waved aside Walther’s 
apology for not waiting until after- 
noon. 

“Nein . nein!” he said. “I or- 
dered an extra pot of coffee — be- 
cause I didn’t think you could 
wait!” 

Willy led Walther into his sitting 
room and poured him some coffee. 

“Maria was already here,” he 
chuckled. “She came to . ah . 
pick up music . and to ask what 
I know about you. I told her noth- 
ing good, and nothing bad!” 

He settled himself in his easy 
chair with a luxurious sigh. His 
bristling white hair and cherubic 
cheeks gave him the appearance of 
a benign old innkeeper, brought to 
life from a canvas by Holbein. 

“All right, tell me what you’ve 
been thinking about all night!” 
Walther shifted tensely to the 
edge of his chair. He spilled a little 

26 



coffee in setting his cup down. 

“I would like to buy copies,” he 
said, “of everything your Digester 
friends have ever smuggled out of 
the vaults!” 

“That’s a large order, my young 
friend.” 

“I’ll pay . whatever it costs!” 
“So would I — if I could afford 
it! But I fear it’s not that simple. 
Take, for example, the chapter of 
Don Quixote you heard last eve- 
ning. The World Government rep- 
resentative from England sent the 
Digester’s notes to an aunt in Liver- 
pool. She’ll read them to her Bo- 
hemian friends tonight, and tomor- 
row they may be in Buenos Aires or 
Istanbul — who knows?” 

“But what happens to them 
eventually? Aren’t they kept in 
some central place?” 

Willy spread his short, pudgy fin- 
gers in a gesture of hopelessness. 

“That would mean organization 
— and we’re not organized. We 
wouldn’t dare to be! I’ve never 
stopped to think what finally hap- 
pens to these things. Perhaps they 
end up among the papers of some 
old dreamer like myself. It’s enough 
that they have brought their mel- 
low moments of happiness!” 

“It’s not enough!” Walther pro- 
tested fiercely. “It’s a great waste! 
How will you ever improve things 
that way?” 

“Who’s trying to improve any- 
thing? The people of Earth are 
content — and those of us who are 
not entirely so — well, we have our 
little underworlds of pleasure.” 

“Is that all you want?” 

“Is there more?” 

Walther jumped up angrily. 

FRANK RILEY 




“I believe there is — and I think 
you do, too!” he said harshly. “If 
you don’t, why did you take me to 
that meeting last night and invite 
me here today? Why did you send 
me off alone with Maria?” 

Willy only smiled, but under his 
silk robe his round belly shook with 
silent laughter. 

“You are a foolish young man 
. and sometimes not so foolish! 
Sit down. Sit down . 

He leaned forward in his easy 
chair, and his manner became 
grave. 

“Perhaps it’s difficult for an old 
man to come near the end of life 
fearing that the beauty he loves will 
never escape from its tomb. Perhaps 
it’s also difficult for an old maestro 
who cherishes the talent and loveli- 
ness of a young woman to know 
that she may never understand 
what her gift really means. Perhaps 
an old man can still dream some 
dreams that a young man could not 
comprehend . .” 

The tight knot in Walther’s stom- 
ach slowly unwound itself. 

“Then you will help me,” he said 
quietly. 

“Yes, I will help you ... if I can 
. and you will help me!” 

At Willy’s suggestion, they de- 
cided to talk first to the Digester 
who had smuggled out the Don 
Quixote chapter. 

“He’s been most successful of all 
of our friends,” said Willy. “He 
might be willing to organize a group 
of Digesters who could bring out 
things to be duplicated, and return 
them, I question, though, that you 
could duplicate many things here 
on Earth.” 

ABBR. 



“Then we’ll ship them away from 
Earth! The outermost world of this 
galaxy — at least to my knowledge 
— is Alden IV ; it’s technically well- 
developed and is a contact with our 
own galaxy.” 

Willy called the bald little Di- 
gester, and he came over right after 
lunch. But his reaction to Walther’s 
proposal was not what they had ex- 
pected. 

“This . this is a terrible mis- 
take!” he stammered. “It’s . it’s 
too big — much too big! Now — by 
being cautious — we can enjoy our 
little evenings together. But if we 
anger the Happy Time, Ltd. people 
we’ll lose everything!” 

Willy snapped his fingers impa- 
tiently. 

“What have we to lose? A chance 
to be tea-cup rebels! This young 
man is giving us an opportunity to 
do something about what we pro- 
fess to believe!” 

The Digester looked pained. 

“We are already doing some- 
thing,” he protested. “Did I not 
bring Chapter IX of Don 
Quixote . * 

“You did, and we enjoyed it! But 
what if we could inspire a rebirth 
of art as big as a whole galaxy in- 
stead of entertaining each other 
with our little flings at Bohemia?” 

The little Digester struggled with 
the thought for a moment, then dis- 
missed it with a shudder. 

“It’s too big,” he repeated miser- 
ably. “Please forget about it, Willy 
— our own way is best.” He glared 
at Walther, and his distress turned 
to rage: “I warn you, young man 
. don’t start trouble for us! If you 
can’t accept the ways of Earth, go 

27 




back where you belong!” 

He held out a trembling hand to 
Willy. 

“Goodby, Willy ... I go now.” 
He hesitated, then added with the 
>vistful air of a small boy waiting 
to be praised: “In two weeks I will 
bring another whole chapter to 
read!” 

When Willy only shrugged, the 
little Digester turned away and sad- 
ly left the room. 

During the next two days, Willy 
contacted several other Digester 
friends. In varying degrees, he met 
with refusals from each. By the end 
of the week, only two of the younger 
Digesters in the Bohemian set had 
agreed to cooperate and even they 
were careful not to promise too 
much. 

“At this rate,” Walther pointed 
out glumly, “it will take years to 
collect any real quantity of material 
- — and I have only six months! Is 
there no other source?” 

Willy shook his head. 

“None that I know of.” 

“There must be!” Walther in- 
sisted. “Do you mean to tell me 
that in all the homes of Earth there 
are no treasured heirlooms of the 
past? No books? No paintings? No 
recordings?” 

“Oh, I’m sure they are,” Willy 
agreed. “But how to reach them? 
We can hardly advertise.” 

He paused, hesitated, then 
snapped his fingers, 

“Wait — there may be a way — 
even more illegal than your first 
suggestion, but still a way . .” 

“What is it?” 

“I used the word ‘underworld’ in 
speaking of our Bohemian group 

28 



last night, but actually there is an 
underworld, of a sort . trafficking 
mostly in liquor. The cartel’s one- 
drink restriction has never been too 
enforceable.” Willy lifted the seat 
of his piano bench and took out a 
bottle. “If you can afford it, you 
can always buy a bootleg supply.” 
“What’s liquor got to do with 
art?” 

“For a price — the underworld 
may be willing to traffic in art, 
literature and music ... in addi- 
tion to alcohol!” 

Willy sent out word through a 
bootlegger who supplied some of 
the opera singers with their favorite 
beverages. The next night, after 
final curtain, a greying, bespecta- 
cled and very distinguished looking 
gentleman in formal dress met 
Willy and Walther in a vacant 
dressing room backstage. He spoke 
tersely, and Willy translated: 

“He says he has friends who 
could be interested in your proposi- 
tion, if there’s money enough in it.” 
“Tell him there’s money enough,” 
Walther replied grimly. 

Willy digested this, and their vis- 
itor smiled his scepticism. 

Not accustomed to having his 
financial standing questioned, Wal- 
ther faced the man himself and de- 
manded : 

“How much money do you 
want?” 

The man understood Walther’s 
tone, if not his words. After a brief 
calculation, he named a price that 
shocked Willy, who turned to 
Walther with dismay: 

“Ten thousand credits for every 
usable piece of art that can be 
bought outright. An additional de- 

FRANK RILEY 




posit of ten thousand if it has to be 
sent away from Earth to be dupli- 
cated. You are to pay all shipping 
costs, as well as legal expenses if 
any of their men are arrested.” 

Walther accepted the terms with 
a nod. 

Their underworld contact stared 
respectfully at Walther, took off 
his suede gloves and proceeded to 
get down to business. It was soon 
arranged for Walther to set up let- 
ters of credit in banks of all major 
cities. Shipments of “tools and ma- 
chinery” would be billed against 
these credits, after bills of lading 
had been inspected by Walther or 
a designated representative. From 
the level of the discussion, they 
might have been transacting legal 
business on a corporation scale. 

Their visitor shook hands with 
each of them, doffed his top hat 
and left with a courteous bow. 

Willy wiped shining beads of 
sweat from his forehead. 

“High finance,” he gasped, “is 
not a part of my daily routine!” 

He dug into a wardrobe trunk, 
brought out a bottle and poured 
two drinks. Raising his glass high 
in the air, he toasted: 

“To art . and crime! I hope 
we don’t have to pay too much for 
either!” 

“How are you getting along with 
Maria?” Willy asked a few days 
later. 

“Just what do you expect to ac- 
complish by throwing the two of us 
together so much,” Walther asked 
bluntly. “Oh, I enjoy it, mind you 
— hut , really, we’re worlds apart. 
When I go back . • .” 

ABBR. 



“With the young everything is 
possible — even the impossible,” 
Willy answered evasively. 

“Well, tell me something more 
about her. Where does she come 
from? Has she ever been engaged? 
Married?” 

Willy filtered a cloud of smoke 
through his nostrils. 

“Maria’s the only talented off- 
spring ever produced by a rather 
poor family in Naples. She still sup- 
ports them — or rather, makes it 
possible for them to be good Happy 
Time consumers. As for her talent 
. well, it was discovered by her 
first school teacher — and from then 
on her education was taken over by 
the opera monopoly! Engaged? 
Nothing serious that I know of. 
Married?” Willy frowned. “I shud- 
der to think of her marriage to one 
of our mechanical young rabbits!” 

Walther blinked. 

“Do you mind explaining that 
one?” 

Willy grimaced. 

“I might as well. You see, sex per 
se is encouraged, with or without 
the formality of marriage. Large 
numbers of offspring are good for 
society! We have the technology to 
provide for them, and the more 
there are, the more potential Happy 
Time consumers! But the arts of 
sex . the refinements of love . 
Can’t you imagine by this time 
what takes place in the boudoirs of 
Earth? Sex is something to be ac- 
commodated between pay-as-you 
see television programs! Besides, 
you’ve encountered a couple of our 
young men, do you consider them 
physically capable of prolonged 
amour?” 

29 




Walther was finding it heavy go- 
ing to picture some of the tilings 
Willy was describing for him. But 
the mention of the two young men 
he had met outside the opera that 
first night brought up a question 
he’d been waiting to ask: 

“What was wrong with them? I 
barely touched them!” 

“Participation sports — physical 

activity of any kind is discouraged 
as interfering with the mass enter- 
tainment media. The few gifted 
boys are trained to be professionals. 
The others scarcely develop enough 
muscle to walk against a strong 
wind. In fact, they don’t walk any 
more than is necessary!” 

Willy paced agitatedly around his 
room, and stopped in front of 
Walther’s chair. He held out his 
hands pleadingly: 

“Be patient with Maria,” he 
begged. “You promised to help me, 
too . and this is all I ask of you!” 
Walther didn’t find it unpleasant 
to comply with Willy’s request. He 
had nothing to do while waiting for 
the first shipment to be assembled, 
and so was able to attend rehearsals 
as well as the performances of the 
operas. 

At rehearsals, he saw a serious 
Maria, a perfectionist devoted to 
her art, a superb technician. After 
rehearsals and the opera itself, he 
saw a Maria who was a product of 
the alien leisure-time culture he had 
found on Earth — a Maria who 
flitted with tireless zest from one 
activity to another, who naturally 
and enthusiastically accepted the 
innumerable forms of entertain- 
ment offered by the Happy Time 
cartel. 



With growing despair, Walther 
tried to find some activity they 
could share. He had always enjoyed 
sports, so he took her to all the 
attractions at the Uniport arenas. 
Each was a new disappointment. 
What was billed as a fight for the 
world’s heavyweight title ended 
with a one-round decision. A bas- 
ketball game was exciting — for 
three furiously-contested minutes. 
The professional tennis match con- 
sisted of each player serving four 
balls, which the other attempted to 
return. 

While traveling to and from the 
various attractions, there were al- 
ways the diversions offered on the 
monorail and stratoway cars. Pri- 
vate transportation, Walther 
learned after hopefully exploring 
this possibility, had been eliminated 
for the obvious reason that it was 
restricted in the number of recre- 
ational opportunities it permitted, 
and might lead to over-indulgence 
in sex — from the point of view of 
the time involved, rather than pro- 
miscuity. And while walking was 
not strictly illegal, those who tend- 
ed to over-indulge were advised to 
curtail their eccentricity. 

# After much thought, Walther did 
hit upon a possibility: It was 

prompted by his recollection that 
the natural beauty of such places 
as the Vienna woods had not been 
obscured. Since Maria was not re- 
quired to be at rehearsals until two 
in the afternoon, they could spend 
the morning visiting some distant 
beauty spots he had read or heard 
about back on Neustadt. Perhaps in 
some of these places the pace of 
leisure would be slowed.

FRANK RILEY 




Maria happily accepted his in- 
itial invitation to spend a morning 
in the South Sea Islands. They 
boarded a stratoway car immedi- 
ately after breakfasting together at 
the hotel, and soon had exchanged 
chilly Uniport for languorous Ta- 
hiti. 

The island village, the natives 
and their costumes, the wet fra- 
grance of the jungle and the soft 
rippling of the surf were all as 
Walther had pictured them since 
his first reading of Stevenson’s voy- 
ages to the South Seas. 

However, suspecting that the 
Happy Time cartel had probably 
made its presence felt in the village 
itself, Walther steered Maria 
around it, toward a path that 
wound invitingly between the tall 
palms and growths of bread fruit 
trees. 

Maria’s hand fell easily, naturally 
into his own, and she pressed a lit- 
tle closer to him, as if awed by the 
unaccustomed stillness. 

She smiled up at him, started to 
say something, but Walther put his 
finger over her lips and shook his 
head. Maria looked puzzled, then 
took out of her handbag a minia- 
turized, self-powered television set, 
with its own tiny coin meter. She 
popped in a coin, flicked the dial, 
and the image of an actor appeared 
on the screen. Walther covered it 
with his hand. He took the set away 
from her, and dropped it into the 
pocket of his coat. Then he pointed 
to her, to the shadowed trees 
around them — and spread his 
hands as if to ask what more any- 
one could possibly want. 

He wasn’t sure she understood, 

ABBR. 



but he put his arm around her waist 
and she rested her head against his 
shoulder. They continued a dozen 
steps down the path, until it ended 
at a silvery lagoon. Here, she 
touched the radio button of her 
wristwatch — rented on a weekly 
basis — and the rhythm of a jazz 
band filled the tropical air. 

Walther took her wrist, shut off 
the radio. He turned her toward 
him and held her face tightly be- 
tween the palms of his hands. 

“No television,” he said firmly, 
“No radio — no nothing — except 
this ...” ~ 

She yielded with a faint smile. 
Her eyes closed, but their lips had 
scarcely touched when she tried to 
draw back. 

“Not that way,” Walther told 
her. “This way . 

He held her face firmly teaching 
her the kind of kisses that were 
used in a frontier world where peo- 
ple had time to make love. She 
struggled away from the unnatural- 
ness of his kissing, then slowly she 
ceased to struggle. 

Suddenly, the lagoon was lighted 
by a brilliant spotlight, and a servo- 
robot stepped out of the shadows. 
It said pleasantly: 

“Since only tourists come to this 
spot, it is presumed that you come 
from some distant planet. There- 
fore, let me point out that all cou- 
ples are limited to two minutes by 
the lagoon. If you hurry, you can 
catch a native dance number be- 
fore the next stratoway leaves.” 

In the same pleasant tone, the 
servo-robot began to repeat these 
words in the other ancient lan- 
guages of Earth. 

31 




Maria’s breath came in short, 
trembling gasps. Her lips were still 
apart, and she touched them with 
the tip of her tongue. 

“Weil nur Touristen naeh diesem 
Fleckchen Erde kommen . ." the 
servo-robot droned along in its 
pleasing voice. 

“Oh, shut up!” Walther growled. 

He took Maria by the arm and 
led her back up the path. 

“Somehow,” he promised her 
fervently, “Somewhere — we’re go- 
ing to finish that.” 

“Dthgn,” she whispered in 
breathless wonder. 



HE FIRST shipment of “tools 
and machinery” had been as- 
sembled at the Uniport landing. 
Walther received a formal notice to 
this effect from the local Exchange 
Bank. The same evening, in a back- 
stage dressing room, he and Willy 
Fritsh received a rather more in- 
formative report from the gentle- 
man who was their contact with the 
bootleg underworld. Every item in 
the shipment was listed and de- 
scribed with meticulous care. By 
reference to a leather-bound pocket 
notebook, the contact managed to 
furnish additional details. 

With Willy’s help, Walther was 
able to judge the nature of the 
haul. He was both pleased and dis- 
appointed. Numerically, it had 
more items than he had expected. 
Qualitatively, it left much to be de- 
sired. There were no complete lit- 
erary works, only fragments. The 
pictures were admittedly cheap 
copies; the recordings were only 
passages from major works. A total 

32 



of eight hundred items had been 
purchased outright by underworld 
agents; fourteen hundred more had 
been borrowed on the security of 
the huge deposit. The latter would 
have to be duplicated on Alden IV 
and returned to their Earth owners 
as quickly as possible. Walther had 
expended a huge fortune for a dubi- 
ous return. But, through Willy, he 
told the contact: 

“Keep it up. Get everything you 
can!” 

Several items did look promis- 
ing: From an elderly spinster in 
Durban, South Africa, the first two 
acts of “Othello” had been obtained 
by the bootlegger who delivered her 
dry sec sherry twice a month; in 
New Orleans, an undertaker had 
parted with a nearly complete Louis 
Armstrong original — about an inch 
was broken off one edge of the rec- 
ord, but the bill of lading stated 
that the rest was quite audible. 
There was also what was reported 
to be the last third of “Grime and 
Punishment,” loaned by a lawyer 
in Prague. 

The second shipment was on a 
par with the first, with the hopeful 
indication that some of the new ac- 
quisitions would complement others 
in the first shipment. Walther stood 
beside Willy at the Uniport land- 
ing as the shuttleship carrying their 
second shipment blasted off on the 
first leg of the long route to far-off 
Alden IV. 

The third shipment was much 
smaller, only three hundred out- 
right purchases and seven hundred 
and twenty items obtained against 
deposit. With the bill of lading 
came a warning note. Walther 




FRANK RILEY 




translated it himself. It was from 
their contact, who wrote: 

“Don’t try to get in touch with 
me until further notice. Send off 
this shipment as soon as possible. 
The Happy Time boys know some- 
thing big is going on.” 

By paying a fabulous premium, 
Walther was able to get the third 
shipment off on the midnight shut- 
tle. Afterwards he stood in the win- 
dow of Willy’s hotel room, staring 
up at the star-filled sky. 

“Well, that may be the end of it,” 
he said. 

“You’ve done well,” said Willy, 
joining him. “I didn’t think you’d 
get that much.” 

“I hope it’ll do some good. Per- 
haps all this new material will at 
least form the basis of a good re- 
search library.” 

Willy glanced, at him specula- 
tively. 

“I was disappointed about the 
music,” he said. “Not one complete 
work.” 

By this time, Walther had learned 
to know when Willy was maneuver- 
ing toward an objective. 

“Just tell me what you’ve got in 
mind,” he grinned. “No prelim- 
inaries.” 

Willy chuckled his appreciation, 
then grew serious. 

“Our opera season ends this 
week . We’re supposed to take a 
month off, then start rehearsals for 
the next tour. Perhaps, during this 
month . .” 

Walther sensed what was coming 
next, but he held his breath — wait- 
ing for Willy to say it. Willy did : 

“Perhaps — if you still want to 
spend more money to pay them — 

ABBR. 



we could persuade some of our 
group to record . .” 

“A full-length opera!” Walther 
exclaimed. “Would they — could 
they — do it?” 

Willy pursed his lips thoughtfully. 

“As for willingness — you’ve ob- 
served that your wealth is rather 
persuasive on Earth. Like most 
artists, our people spend more than 
they earn, and would probably try 
anything for what you could pay 
them. As for ability — we’d un- 
doubtedly have to record in short 
sessions. We might even have to 
break up the arias into sections, be- 
cause we’re not conditioned for sus- 
tained effort.” 

“I’ll pay them anything to try it,” 
Walther broke in, enthusiastically. 
“Where would you try it — here in 
Uniport?” 

“Hardly. But there’s an old inn 
in North Wales where I once spent 
a vacation with some of our group. 
If the Happy Time agents should 
be watching us now, it would be 
quite natural to return to that inn.” 

“Maria ... do you think she 
would?” 

Willy sighed, and shrugged. 

“Not for the money alone . 
she’s quite a perfectionist about her 
art. But I’m hopeful that by this 
time . .” His eyes twinkled. 

Walther laughed. 

“What a chess player you would 
make! I think you’ve been moving 
me around like a pawn ever since 
the first evening we met!” 

“Not a pawn,” Willy corrected 
him with a smile. “A knight.” 

However, they decided not to tell 
Maria the real purpose of the pro- 
posed vacation until they were all 

33 




set up at the inn in North Wales. 
Walther thought the setting sound- 
ed perfect for some personal un- 
finished business. 

“Even I could sing an aria in 
such a place,” Willy enthused. 

Willy began quietly and individ- 
ually contacting other members of 
his company. With the kind of pay- 
ment Walther authorized him to 
offer, he had little difficulty get- 
ting performers for the venture. 
Most of them thought the project 
ridiculous, but the money was more 
than they would normally earn in 
an entire season. Willy swore each 
of them to silence. They were to 
treat the trip as nothing more than 
a vacation. He made arrangements 
for the various pieces of recording 
equipment to be shipped separately 
from London, Berlin and New 
York. 

Willy’s pink cheeks were perpetu- 
ally flushed these days, and his 
bright eyes sparkled brighter than 
ever. When Walther brought up 
the question of which opera would 
be attempted, he discovered that 
the shrewd old maestro had long 
ago acquired Puccini’s complete 
“Madame Butterfly” and had al- 
ready packed the music for ship- 
ment to North Wales. 

The night before they were to 
leave Uniport, a familiar, distin- 
guished figure appeared backstage, 
threading his way between the huge 
crates being packed by the servo- 
robot stagehands. Willy led him im- 
mediately to one of the dressing 
rooms. 

With admirable simplicity, the 
underworld contact put a proposi- 
tion before them, 

34 



The first three shipments had 
pretty well exhausted the supply of 
readily obtainable material. With 
the Happy Time agents now 
alerted, the risk of trying to get 
more material wasn’t justified by 
the probable results. But the un- 
derworld wasn’t anxious to let go of 
a good revenue source without one 
big payoff. 

What did they propose to do? 

Willy’s voice shook as he trans- 
lated: 

“For — for the right — fee — they’re 
willing to break into the Uniport 
Library vaults!” 

Walther was silent for a long 
moment. Instinctively, he recoiled 
from such overt action. But reason 
asked: Why should he draw back 
now? Everything taken from the 
vaults would be duplicated and re- 
turned in good condition. Was it 
right to let his own personal re- 
action stand in the way of some- 
thing that might benefit whole ages 
of Mankind? 

When he had firm control of his 
own voice, he nodded and asked: 

“How do they propose to do it?” 

The plan was a piece of profes- 
sional craftsmanship. In the cen- 
tury of its existence, no one had 
ever attempted to enter the new 
library illegally. With the absence 
of any known motive for doing so, 
the need for guarding against it was 
routine. There were the usual doors 
and time-locks, the alarm systems 
and servo-robot guards, but nothing 
that couldn’t be handled. They 
would bring in technicians from 
Vega VI to handle the time-locks. 
Otherwise, barring some unsus- 
pected move by the Happy Time 

FRANK RILEY 




security police, the job was within 
the bounds of their own abilities. 
Of course, there must be meticulous 
attention to detail and planning. 

The contact explained that, ac- 
cording to preliminary surveys, they 
could count on about two hours of 
work after gaining entrance to the 
vaults. By concentrating only on 
books, for speed of handling and 
packing, a reasonable sized crew 
should be able to get at least twenty 
thousand volumes out of the vaults 
and into a waiting monorail trans- 
port, where the crates would al- 
ready be assembled. Previous ar- 
rangements could be made for the 
midnight freight shuttle to take the 
crates from the Uniport landing to 
Cyngus III. From there, the crates 
could be dispersed throughout the 
immeasurable reaches of deep 
space. 

“But they must be returned,” 
Walther insisted. ‘Til see to that!” 

Their visitor shrugged, indicating 
that this detail was of no interest 
to him. He named a price, and 
when Walther promptly agreed to 
it, Willy poured them all a drink. 

“When I was a small boy,” Willy 
said, in a voice that still trembled, 
“I slid on the seat of my trousers 
down an icy slope in the Alps. It 
was good fun for the first twenty 
yards; and then I realized I had 
gone beyond my power to stop. 
That’s the way I feel right now. 
Prosit!” 

As their caller started to leave, 
Walther stopped him by raising his 
hand. Throughout the discussion, 
an irresistible compulsion had been 
growing within him. Now he had to 
speak: 

ABBR. 



“I’ve come a long way,” he told 
Willy. “Granting that nothing goes 
wrong, and that I’m able to leave, 
I know I’ll never return to Earth 
again. But there’s one selfish, per- 
sonal thing I want to do before 
leaving. It isn’t sensible, I know — 
but neither was my dream to begin 
with. I want to go with these men 
into the Uniport vaults — just to see 
for an hour — greater treasures than 
I can ever hope to see again.” 



F ROM HIS room on the second 
floor of the Bridge End Inn, 
Walther could look down upon the 
River Dee, tumbling along beside 
what was still called the Shropshire 
and Union Railroad Canal, al- 
though the tracks of that ancient 
railroad had been torn up centuries 
ago. Old ways and names had a 
way of persisting in North Wales, 
despite the pace of modern leisure. 
Walther had noted with satisfaction 
that the double consonants of the 
old language, with their strange 
throaty pronunciation, had defied 
contraction. Llangollen and Llanty- 
silio were two nearby cities whose 
names were still spelled out, as they 
had been for a thousand years. 

He glanced at his watch. Maria 
should be waking from her nap just 
about now. In a half hour, Willy 
wanted to meet with her and ask 
her cooperation in doing “Madame 
Butterfly”. Walther had suggested 
waiting until the next day, since 
Maria was tired from the closing 
night festivities in Uniport, and 
from packing the rest of the night 
in time to catch the morning strato- 
way. But Willy opposed delay. 

35 




As he stood there by his window, 
Walther had a sense of peace, for 
the first time since he’d been on 
Earth. The moment was all the 
more to be cherished, since he knew 
it could not last. 

A light knock on his door jarred 
the view and the peace out of focus. 

“Come in,” he called, and turned, 
expecting to see Willy. 

But it was Maria who entered, 
looking remarkably refreshed after 
her short nap. She wore a sweater, 
a very short skirt and open-toed 
sandals. Her long, dark hair was 
combed out loose. 

It was the first time he had seen 
her dressed so casually. She looked 
more like a Welsh mountain girl 
than the star of the Uniport opera. 

“Hi!” he said, inadequately. 

She laughed at his surprise, and 
put her arms around him. 

“Hi,” she answered. 

Maria had not forgotten her first 
lesson beside the Tahiti lagoon; and 
Walther was reviewing some subse- 
quent lessons when both of them 
became aware of the unwelcome 
fact that they were not alone. 

Willy Fritsh stood in the door- 
way, smiling benignly. 

“Oh, hell,” said Walther. 

“Believe me, I didn’t intend to 
interrupt,” Willy said happily. “But 
since we’re all together right now 
. under such . ah . pro- 
pitious circumstances, suppose we 
talk things over.” 

“Later,” said Walther. 

Ignoring his protest, Willy sat 
himself comfortably on the window 
seat, opened a large envelope and 
took out the bound libretto of 
“Madame Butterfly”. He handed 

36 



it to Maria, without comment. She 
stared at it curiously, but made no 
move to open it until Willy mo- 
tioned her to do so. 

She nodded with recognition at 
the title page, then as she riffled 
through succeeding pages, her ex- 
pression changed from surprise to 
distaste. She tried to hand the li- 
bretto back to Willy, but instead of 
taking it, he drew her to the win- 
dow seat beside him, and spoke to 
her as a father might speak to his 
daughter. 

By this time, Walther could un- 
derstand a little of what Willy was 
saying and he could guess the rest 
of it. Maria’s first reaction was to 
stare incredulously at Willy. As the 
full meaning of what he was asking 
became clear to her, she looked up 
at Walther. He saw scorn and anger 
in her dark eyes. 

When she looked back at Willy, 
it was to shake her head in em- 
phatic refusal. 

Willy’s tone became even more 
persuasive. He gazed out the win- 
dow as he spoke, down at the river 
pouring over the weir and ducking 
under the old stone bridge. Maria 
rolled the libretto into a tight scroll. 
Her fingers showed white through 
her unpolished nails. 

Willy stopped abruptly. He looked 
older, tired. Maria remained silent, 
her lips compressed into a tight 
line. At last she answered him, in a 
voice that was tightly, coldly con- 
trolled. 

She stood up and walked toward 
the door. Walther held out his 
hand; she ignored it. He started 
after her, and Willy said, 

“Let her go.” 



FRANK RILEY 




Willy looked so depressed that 
Walther felt a need to comfort him. 

“It’s all right,” he said. “We’ll 
forget the whole idea.” 

Willy shook his head. 

“She’ll do it,” he said wearily. 
“But ...” 

“She’ll do it because she thinks 
she owes it to me.” 

Walther waited for the old 
maestro to continue. 

“As soon as we’re through re- 
cording,” Willy went on, pushing 
himself up from the window seat, 
“Maria wants to be released to an- 
other opera company.” 

“I’ll go see her right now,” 
Walther began. 

“Not now,” Willy interrupted. 
“She wouldn’t have anything to do 
with you. She thinks your only in- 
terest has been this recording.” 

Willy started rehearsals early the 
next morning, in the big stone barn 
behind the inn. The structure’s high 
roof and thick walls provided nat- 
ural acoustics, while its location was 
far enough from Llangollen to 
avoid creating undue curiosity. Re- 
cording equipment had been set up 
along one side; around it, the 
orchestra was grouped. The center 
area was marked off for vocal re- 
hearsals. 

Willy handled the direction him- 
self, and not for a century had any 
director on Earth undertaken such 
a staggering task. 

From the first moments of re- 
hearsal, it became evident that the 
orchestra could never hope to play 
an entire number in one sustained 
effort. It was not so much the physi- 
cal effort involved, as the difficulty 

ABBR. 



of maintaining an emotional crest 
for so long a period. The first vio- 
linist fainted halfway through the 
opening sequence between Lieutenr 
ant Pinkerton and the American 
consul. This triggered a mass col- 
lapse among the woodwinds. The 
pianist wavered off an octave 
through sheer fatigue, and the 
drummer dropped his sticks when 
Willy cued him to step up tempo. 

Willy was frantic. 

“We’ll have to record a few bars 
at a time — until they’re more accus- 
tomed to the strain,” he told Wal- 
ther. “What an editing job this will 
bei” 

The problem with the vocalists 
was even more acute. Every duet 
would have to be recorded in at 
least ten segments. 

Maria was the only one who 
stubbornly insisted on doing a com- 
plete number. It was a point of 
pride with her. She hated the 
music; it violated every principle 
she had ever learned. But the per- 
fectionist in her, reinforced by her 
bitterness toward Walther and her 
sense of obligation to Willy, drove 
her to deliver the full measure of 
her promise. 

In the love duet between Butter- 
fly and Pinkerton, which closed Act 
I, the pale and perspiring Pinker- 
ton was nearly spent as he began 
his final lines: 

Come then, 

Love, what fear holds you trem- 
bling? 

Have done with all misgivings . 

His impassioned plea quavered; 
he clutched Maria’s arm to steady 
himself. Willy cutr the music. For 
five minutes they held cold com- 

37 




presses to the singer’s wrists, while 
members of the orchestra slumped, 
exhausted, in their chairs. When all 
were somewhat recovered, Pinker- 
ton attempted the next two lines of 
his wedding night rapture: 

The night doth enfold us, 

See the world lies sleeping . 
And then he had to rest again. 
But when Maria answered, her 
dark eyes flashing defiantly, she 
went through her entire eight lines 
without a pause. 

Her great test came with the 
famous second act solo, “One Fine 
Day”. It was difficult enough to 
learn the strange words and music, 
but to achieve and hold the emo- 
tional peaks of the solo for nearly 
two minutes was something she had 
never before attempted. 

Because she insisted on doing the 
entire aria without resting, Willy 
set the recording for early in the 
morning, when the orchestra would 
be fresh. He asked them to assem- 
ble on the improvised sound stage 
an hour after breakfast. 

Willy limited the orchestra to a 
minimum tune up period so that the 
musicians could conserve their 
energies for the ordeal ahead. The 
violins were the last to be ready. 
When the final string had been 
tuned, Willy cued the engineers to 
stand by and pointed the tip of his 
baton toward Maria. 

“Un Bel Di . ” 

The words came clear as the 
notes of a silver bell, calling back 
to life the beauty that had been 
dead for so long. Walther felt his 
stomach muscles tighten; a tingle 
of wonder crept up his spine. 
Standing there in the center of 



the old stone bam, wearing only 
sandals, shorts and a light blouse 
open at die neck, Maria still man- 
aged to convey the feelings of the 
lonely young Japanese wife who 
sang so confidently of her husband’s 
return from across the sea. 

This was Maria, the incompar- 
able artist, using all of her tech- 
nique to blend the unfamiliar words 
and music. 

But for the first few lines it was 
only a technical tour de force. Then 
Puccini’s music began to take hold 
of Maria, merging the artist with 
the woman, and creating yet a third 
entity out of the two. 

He saw Willy turn, transfixed to- 
ward Maria. His hands and baton 
continued to move, but not by con- 
scious direction. His pink cheeks 
were pale, etched with deepening 
lines. His blue eyes were misted. 

Even the other members of the 
company seemed moved by Maria’s 
performance. Yet they could not 
stay with her emotionally ; they were 
compelled to break the tension by 
shuffling their feet and self-con- 
sciously lighting cigarettes. 

To a man, the orchestra played 
as if hypnotized, sweeping through 
measure after measure with an in- 
tensity that seemed impossible to 
maintain. 

For an uncertain moment, near 
the end of the aria, it looked as if 
Maria could not finish. She swayed, 
held tightly to the microphone for 
support. Walther stepped forward 
to catch her, but she recovered, 
drawing on some inner source of 
strength to finish: 

“. This will all come to pass, 
as I tell you! 



38 



FRANK RILEY 




Banish your idle fears . 

For he will return, I know it!” 

As Maria finished, she tore her- 
self away from the microphone. Her 
lips were trembling; her eyes were 
wide, like those of a woman in 
shock. She half-ran out of the barn, 
stopped — confused — in the bright 
sunlight, and then ran on down 
the path toward the Inn. 



U NTIL LATE afternoon, Maria 
would see no one. Then she 
agreed to see Willy for a few mo- 
ments. 

When the old maestro left her 
room, he looked deeply troubled. 

“I don’t know . .” he told Wal- 
ther, shaking his head. “I don’t 
know what this has done to her.” 
“What did she say?” 

“Right now, she says she will 
never sing again. She’s going to her 
home in Italy this evening.” 

“Can we do anything?” 

“Looks like we’ve already done 
more than we should. Mixing two 
cultures in one artist is dangerous 
chemistry!” 

Up to this moment. Walther had 
deliberately avoided any decision 
about Maria. She had been a con- 
tinuing and delightful challenge, 
especially since Tahiti, but beyond 
that he had not allowed his 
thoughts to go. Now there was a 
responsibility he could no longer 
evade. He had watched the dual 
personality that was Maria being 
shattered under the impact of Puc- 
cini’s music. How would the pieces 
fit together again? Should he stand 
by and watch? Or should he try to 
help? And if he could help her, 

ABBR. 



how would it all end? The gulf be- 
tween two cultures could be wider 
than the mathematics of space be- 
tween two galaxies, or the bridging 
power of sex. 

Against Willy’s advice, Walther 
decided to catch the same strato- 
way with Maria, and take his 
chances on what might happen. 

But a phone call from Uniport 
abruptly changed his plans. It was 
from their underworld contact, who 
informed Willy that the “Board of 
Directors” was meeting that eve- 
ning; if Walther wanted to attend, 
he would have to take the next 
stratoway to Uniport. Someone 
would meet him at the station. 

Uniport or Italy? Willy inter- 
vened to make the decision easier. 

“This will be your only chance 
to get into the vaults,” he counseled. 
“Besides, Maria must think some 
things through for herself.” 

His emotions in turmoil, Walther 
boarded the next stratoway for 
Uniport. As North Wales and Eng- 
land blurred into the ocean beneath 
him, he had the feeling that he 
would never see the River Dee 
country again. 

A tall, thin young man, with eyes 
as colorless as waxpaper, met him 
at the Uniport station and hurried 
him into a monorail car. Walther 
tentatively began a question, but 
the young man stopped him with 
an opaque stare. 

Four times they changed mono- 
rail cars, ending up eventually at a 
freight terminal, where an older 
man met them and pointed silently 
to one of the freight cars. Inside, 
Walther saw a strange assortment 
of smiling servo-robots and grim- 

39 




faced humans sitting around on 
empty packing cases. The cases 
were already marked for shipment 
and trans-shipment throughout the 
galaxy. 

After quick, sharp glances of ap- 
praisal, no one paid any attention 
to him. He sat down beside one of 
the servo-robots and forced himself 
to wait as patiently as possible. For 
a half hour nothing happened. The 
servo-robots remained motionless; 
the humans chain-smoked until the 
air in the freight car was an acrid 
grey smog. Nearly every human 
switched constantly and nervously 
from his tiny TV set to his watch- 
radio. One of the men brought out 
a bottle, but quickly put it away 
after a staccato command from the 
greying, square- jawed man who 
seemed to be in charge. 

At 6 o’clock, without warning, 
the freight car vibrated slightly and 
began to move. The servo-robots 
stood up attentively; the humans 
snuffed out their cigarettes. Peering 
through one of the small windows, 
Walther saw that twilight was 
merging into night. 

It was completely dark when the 
car stopped at a loading platform 
behind the steel-grey building that 
towered above the Uniport cultural 
vaults. A servo-robot guard stepped 
forward challengingly. 

At a gesture from the leader, one 
of the servo-robots within the car 
marched out on the platform and 
presented a punched bill of lading. 
As the guard fed the document into 
its tabulator, the other stepped 
closer and lightly brushed against 
it. The guard stiffened, as though 
from a severe shock. There was a 

40 



sound like that of a racing motor 
suddenly thrown out of gear. Then 
a click, and silence. The servo- 
robot guard unhinged itself at the 
knees and collapsed on the plat- 
form. 

Another signal from the leader, 
and out of the car scurried the 
humans and servo-robots. They ran 
across the platform toward the 
shadow of the building. Here, two 
of the men, who Walther guessed to 
be thS experts imported to Earth 
for this job, traced a circle around 
the door with an instrument that 
resembled a small camera. Evident- 
ly this was to cut off the alarm 
system, for almost immediately they 
relaxed and went on to open the 
door without any attempt at cau- 
tion. 

Proceeding in single file, lighting 
their way with powerful flashlights, 
they passed in similar manner 
through a series of inner doors to 
an elevator leading down into the 
vaults. A servo-robot took over its 
operation, and they shot downward. 
At each level, the leader stepped 
off the elevator to look around. At 
the sixth level, he nodded and they 
followed him into the vault. 

This was the book vault. Tier 
upon tier, the stacks of books 
reached in every direction as far as 
a flashlight beam could probe. 

Motioning Walther to follow 
him, the leader took a piece of 
chalk and began marking off 
groups of books. The men rounded 
up library carts for the servo- 
robots, who swiftly fell to loading 
the carts and trundling them back 
to the elevator. 

Walther soon moved ahead of 
FRANK RILEY 




the leader and began marking the 
books himself. They had started in 
the M-sections. With mounting ex- 
citement, Walther chalked off 
Machiavelli, Mann, Markham, 
Masefield, Maugham, Maupassant, 
Melville, Millay, Moliere. 

Leaping to the next tier, he raced 
through the stacks marking the 
works of Nathan and Newton, O’- 
Neill . Ovid . Then on to 
Parker, Pater, Pepys, Plato, Poe. 
. Racine, Rousseau. Sand- 
burg . Santayana. 

What an astounding haul this 
would be! The masterpieces of the 
ages, to be whisked across space, 
from star system to star system, un- 
til at last they reached his home- 
land, where they would grow and 
multiply a million-fold, generation 
into generation, down through the 
millenniums of universal time. 

Back to the A-sections! Adams, 
Aeschylus, Anderson, Aristotle . 

On to the B-sections! Bacon . 
Balzac . Benet . Bronte . 
Byron . 

It was like drinking a heady bur- 
gundy. Each new title whetted his 
taste for more. 

Inevitably, the very magnitude of 
the thing began to have its sobering 
effect. Was it actually possible to 
get so much material out of the 
vaults? Off the Earth? 

The leader caught up with him 
in the K-sections and motioned 
him not to mark off any more 
books. They’d have a hard time 
getting those Walther had already 
chalked. 

Walther rode up with the next 
elevator load. On the way down, he 
indicated to the servo-robot that he 



wanted to go all the way to the bot- 
tom level. There he stepped out of 
the elevator and stood in the dark- 
ness for a moment to steady himself 
from the excitement of marking so 
many books. 

Then he swept his flashlight 
beam slowly around the vault. 

It was like turning on a light in 
a tomb that had been sealed for 
centuries. Certainly this tomb had 
been sealed, to all except the Di- 
gesters and the servo-robot atten- 
dants. 

The vault was at least two hun- 
dred feet high. Walther could only 
guess at the other dimensions, and 
the extent of the corridors that 
fanned out like the spokes of a 
wheel. Sculptured figures from all 
the ages of Earth loomed out of the 
shadows with a quality of arrested 
life that might at any moment 
move again. 

The figures of the Pharaohs were 
here, the chiseled perfection of 
Athens and Rome, the genius of 
the Renaissance and the primitive 
gods of the Aztecs. The armless 
Venus gazed down dispassionately 
on the bowed back of the Discus 
Thrower, while Rodin’s Thinker 
stared in eternal contemplation at 
the belly of Buddha. 

And then Walther looked up- 
ward. 

High overhead, reassembled on a 
great oblong span of artificial ceil- 
ing suspended from the top of the 
vault, were the nine immortal 
panels from the Sistine Chapel. 
Tracing his beam of light through 
scene by scene of Michaelangelo’s 
creation of the world, lingering 
among the connective figures of the 



ABBR. 



41 




prophets and sibyls, the lunettes 
and triangles, Walther lost all sense 
of time. 

When his back and neck muscles 
could stand the strain no longer, 
he wandered deeper into the dim 
recesses of the vault, following cor- 
ridor after corridor, entranced. He 
was like a condemned man watch- 
ing his last sunrise and trying to ab- 
sorb it ail, knowing he would not 
come this way again. 

Walther did not realize how far 
he had wandered until he came at 
last to the end of a corridor and 
glanced at his watch. 

Ten o’clock! 

He’d been gone from the group 
for nearly three hours, and the en- 
tire raid had been timed for two 
hours. 

He started running for the eleva- 
tor. Corridor led into corridor, gal- 
lery into gallery. It took him twenty 
minutes to find his way back to the 
main vault, another five minutes to 
locate the right elevator. He 
pressed the button and listened. 
There was no sound within the 
shaft. 

He shouted, and there was only 
the echo of his own voice rever- 
berating through the ages around 
him. 

Fighting down a flutter of panic, 
Walther turned off his light and 
leaned against the elevator door to 
organize his thoughts. 

He was sure the others had left 
on time to make shipment schedules 
at the Uniport landing. They might 
have delayed long enough to make 
a cursory search for him, but his 
safety was no part of their commit- 

42 



ment. They had successfully raided 
the vaults, which was all they had 
contracted to do. Before morning, 
most of them undoubtedly would 
have embarked on inter-planetary 
cruises. 

Walther’s first decision was to 
try the other elevators on the off- 
chance that one had been left in 
operating gear. 

None had. 

Next, he set off to look for a 
stair well, fire ladder or other 
method of exit. It took him three 
hours to cover the entire vault and 
its corridors. No doubt of it, the 
elevators were the only means of 
entering and leaving. 

It was now one o’clock. In eight 
hours the upper level doors would 
open to the Digesters. No particular 
effort had been made to camou- 
flage the gaps in the stacks. His one 
chance was to reach the street level 
before anyone noticed the missing 
books. Meanwhile, he could do 
nothing except spend the night as 
comfortably as possible. He spread 
his coat on the marble floor behind 
the squat statue of a Malayan god- 
dess. 

Surprisingly, he did doze off to- 
ward morning. He awoke shortly 
after eight o’clock, and began to 
punch the elevator button every 
five minutes. Finally, at three min- 
utes to nine, a faint hum responded 
within the shaft. He retreated hast- 
ily into the nearest corridor, and 
waited another ten minutes before 
bringing the elevator down to his 
level. Then he entered it, pressed 
the street-level control and shot 
upward. 

He lit a cigarette, and was pre- 
FRANK RILEY 




pared to step out nonchalantly as 
soon as the door opened. 

His exit was nonchalant enough, 
but the servo-robot guard in front 
of the elevator held out its tabula- 
tor slot and said. 

“Crdpls.” 

Walther was shaken, but did not 
freeze up. He fumbled in his pocket 
for a slip of paper and tried to cram 
it into the tabulator. A red light 
flashed on the servo-robot’s chest; 
a buzzer sounded. 

Thirty yards beyond, Walther 
saw the front desk and the door 
open to the street. He acted with 
the impulse. A sidestep took him 
around the servo-robot, and then 
he was racing toward the door. 

Three steps later, a vise-like 
grip clamped around his shoulders 
and swept him off his feet. Twist- 
ing, he saw that the servo-robot’s 
arm had elongated, and that the 
fingers had stretched to encircle his 
body. He kicked hard at the arm, 
and that was his last conscious act. 

The next time Walther opened 
his eyes, his head throbbed so vi- 
olently he closed them again. When 
the spinning stopped, he tried once 
more. 

Around him he saw four metallic 
walls, and overhead a ceiling of 
similar material. Except for a ven- 
tilator grid, and the outlines of two 
doors, there were no breaks in the 
wall and no decorations. He was 
lying on a low, narrow cot, and 
was still fully dressed. 

He felt his head. There was a 
large lump above his right temple, 
where he might have struck the 
floor. But he was still too groggy for 
much speculation. He closed his 

ABBR. 



eyes to ease the throbbing, and fell 
into an uneasy sleep. 

The creaking of the door must 
have roused him, for it was closing 
as he focussed on it. A tray of food 
was within arm’s reach. A smaller 
door behind his bed had been 
opened; it led to a tiny washroom. 

After freshening up and trying 
the food, Walther felt much better. 
He was a strong-nerved young man, 
not accustomed to worry, and he 
tried to weigh the facts for and 
against him. If the shipments had 
gone off without a hitch, things 
might not be so bad. He’d been 
found leaving the vaults, but no 
one would suppose that he’d have 
staved around after somehow dis- 
posing of the books. They might 
suspect him, but it would be hard 
to disprove his story that he’d 
taken the elevator by mistake the 
day before and been trapped over- 
night. Anyway, as a visitor from an- 
other galaxy, he was entitled to 
certain consideration. 

He felt even better when the 
door opened late in the afternoon 
to admit Willy Fritsh and a tight- 
lipped man of about forty. 

“Your lawyer,” said Willy. He 
looked and sounded grim. 

After completing introductions, 
Willy told him that he was indeed 
accused of the theft, and would be 
arraigned in the morning. 

“They can’t prove it,” Walther 
answered calmly. 

“They think they can. Our Di- 
gester friend — remember our Bohe- 
mian evening? — has come forward 
to accuse you. He’ll testify about 
the offer we made him.” 

“We? Will he accuse you, too?” 

43 




“Not exactly* I’m supposed to be 
an innocent bystander. A friend 
who was used!” 

In spite of the circumstances, a 
hint of the old sparkle returned to 
Willy’s eyes and he smiled faintly. 

“What can they do about it?” 
Walther demanded. After all, he 
was a Von Koenigsburg. 

Willy’s smile vanished. 

“Our legal friend here says ten 
years would be a light sentence.” 

They discussed the case for an 
hour, while the lawyer took meti- 
culous notes. Then, through Willy, 
the attorney began questioning 
Walther about his financial status. 
Even in the language of consonants, 
his voice was suave. 

The lawyer’s precise little sym- 
bols wavered as Walther briefly 
outlined his family circumstances, 
but a servo-robot opened the door 
before further questions could be 
asked. 

Willy started to shake hands with 
Walther, then impulsively put his 
arms around him. There were tears 
in the corners of his blue eyes. He 
tried to say something, but gave it 
up and hurried out the door behind 
the attorney. 

“Wait.” Walther called after 
him. “Have you heard anything 
from Maria?” 

Willy sadly shook his head. 

“No. Nothing.” 

Walther had scarcely finished 
breakfast next morning when a 
servo-robot came to take him to 
court. The robot linked thumb and 
forefinger around Walther’s wrist 
with the grip of a handcuff. 

There were no spectators in the 
courtroom; perhaps, Walther 

44 



thought glumly, because it was a 
free attraction that would interfere 
with the consumption of happy 
time entertainment. Willy joined 
him at the defendants table. 

“Still the loyal, misguided 
friend,” Willy murmured. “I volun- 
teered to be your interpreter.” 

The Judge was a human, but all 
clerks and bailiffs were servo- 
robots. As soon as the court was 
gaveled into session, the Prosecutor 
presented a twenty-second digest of 
the case against Walther, and called 
the little Digester as a substantiat- 
ing witness. 

Walther didn’t need any transla- 
tion to understand what the witness 
was saying. Shifting unhappily in 
his chair, and avoiding Willy’s eyes, 
the little Digester answered pre- 
liminary questions in a scarcely 
audible voice. But when he pointed 
his finger at Walther, his voice be- 
came shrill and he reddened to the 
top of his bald head. 

“Now he’ll be afraid to attend 
one of our meetings,” Willy mur- 
mured. “That’s what he’s really 
blaming you for.” 

When the Digester left the stand, 
a portly man, with a perpetual tick 
in his left cheek, arose to address 
the court. He was at the Prosecu- 
tor’s table, and until this moment 
had seemed to take very little in- 
terest in the proceedings. But now 
he spoke in a steel-edged voice that 
was in surprising contrast to his 
slow, heavy movements. 

“He’s speaking as a friend of the 
court,” Willy whispered. “His office 
is legal representative of the Happy 
Time cartel in Uniport. He’s tell- 
ing the court what a terrible of- 

FRANK RILEY 




fense you committed — but is willing 
— in the public interest not to press 
charges if you’ll return the books 
at once. Otherwise, he demands 
you be held for trial without bail.” 

Walther’s lawyer conferred brief- 
ly with Willy. The Judge and Pro- 
secutor also conferred, and both 
spoke with obvious deference to the 
Happy Time attorney. 

With a bow to all three, Wal- 
ther’s lawyer addressed the court. 
His smooth voice rippled lightly 
over the harsh consonants, and his 
thin lips parted often in a swift, 
mirthless smile. He spoke for almost 
a minute, and the Judge began to 
toy with his gavel, watching the 
Happy Time attorney for a cue to 
his feelings. The attorney had 
slumped back in his chair, eyes 
drooping. But the tick in his cheek 
worked furiously. 

Then Walth^’s lawyer turned 
toward the Happy Time lawyer 
and paused dramatically. 

“He’s talking about your family,” 
Willy whispered again. “I think 
he’s exaggerating a bit, but he says 
they own an entire planet twice the 
size of Earth.” 

When the lawyer continued, the 
smoothness was gone from his 
voice. His words came hard, crisp, 
brief. The elderly Judge sagged 
back in his chair, the Prosecutor 
blinked and the Happy Time at- 
torney allowed his eyes to close 
completely. 

“I hope you approve,” Willy 
said in a shaky whisper. “You’ve 
just offered to deposit a hundred 
million credits with the Happy 
Time cartel as assurance the books 
will be returned.” 



“What? — I don’t even admit tak- 
ing them!” 

“Neither does your lawyer. But, 
as he puts it, if anyone acting in 
your behalf, but without your di- 
rect knowledge, should have seized 
these books and shipped them off 
the Earth, you will assume respon- 
sibility for their return. Otherwise, 
they may be turned loose among 
the people of Earth to plant seeds 
of future trouble.” 

Walther’s lawyer emphasized one 
brief phrase, and sat down. Even 
Walther recognized the words: 
One hundred million credits. 

The Happy Time attorney slowly 
opened his eyes and heaved himself 
to his feet. He spread out both 
pudgy hands to the Judge, and 
shrugged his bulking shoulders. He 
spoke briefly, and the steel-edge 
was gone from his voice. 

“He suggests that the court in 
its wisdom, temper justice with 
mercy,” Willy translated excitedly. 

After this it was a matter of de- 
tail, with the Prosecutor insisting 
only that Walther be kept in cus- 
tody and deported immediately 
after the deposit had been ar- 
ranged. 

The strain of the whole affair 
had been too much for Willy, but 
as the smiling servo-robot led Wal- 
ther out of the courtroom, he called 
after him: 

“I’ll be at the landing!” 

Walther knew he should be hap- 
py. He had found what he wanted 
on Earth. Not in the way he had 
hoped, but the final reckoning was 
the same. Still, there was an empti- 
ness to it all, an emptiness and an 
aching. 



ABBR. 



45 




When he cleared customs, and 
was released by his servo-robot 
guard, Walther saw Willy Fritsh 
waiting beside the Cyngus III shut- 
tleship. A half dozen of his musi- 
cians were with him. 

Willy said with simple direct- 
ness: 

“If you want us, we’d like to go 
with you.” 

Of all the things that had hap- 
pened to him in the last twenty- 
four hours, this took Walther most 
completely by surprise. He stared, 
speechless, from Willy to the musi- 
cians, most of them older men. 

“These few came to me,” Willy 
said. “They don’t want to go back 
to our own music — Neither do I!” 
His voice broke, and he continued, 
pleading: “We can help hring your 
dream to life in the few years left 
to us.” 

Walther enveloped the old mae- 



stro in a bear-hug that crushed the 
breath out of him. 

“Want you?” he cried. “Now, 
who’s a fool?” 

“You are,” gasped Willy, “if you 
thought I’d leave part of my heart 
behind!” 

Walther looked around quickly. 

At the top of the shuttleship 
ramp stood a young woman with 
half a smile and half a question on 
her lips. There was doubt in that 
smile, and fear. There was loneli- 
ness and wonder, and hope. It was 
a promise and a warning of all that 
lay ahead for them, out there be- 
yond the stars. 

Humbly, more knowing that he 
had yet been in his short life, Wal- 
ther held out his hands and walked 
up the ramp toward her — toward 
a dream that was over, and a real- 
ity that could be more bitter, more 
sweet, than any dream. • • •

Is Man on the way to perfect health and

free of plagues, disease and deformity? 

PROGNOSIS 

FOR TOMORROW 



BY ALAN E. NOURSE, M. D. 



T HERE are a number of people in medicine these 
days who seem to feel that we are now in the midst 
of the Golden Age of medical discovery, and I don’t 
believe a word of it. 

“But look at what we’ve accomplished in the last half 
century!” they will cry indignantly. “We’ve routed in- 
fectious diseases with the use of antibiotic drugs. We’ve 
given life and hope to diabetics. We’ve solved the riddle 
of poliomyelitis. We have proved that the human heart 
can be opened by the surgeon’s knife and closed again 
with impunity. Give us enough money, enough workers, 



47 




and enough education and we 
could wipe malaria from the face 
of the Earth in fourteen days flat. 
We’ve made more progress in diag- 
nosis, treatment, and cure of human 
illness in the past fifty years than 
in the preceding fifty centuries! If 
this isn’t the Golden Age, then 
what is? Why shouldn’t we expect 
to continue at this pace until all 
human illness has fallen to the 
blade?” 

Well, why shouldn’t we? 

There is a very simple and fun- 
damental reason why we shouldn’t 
expect to, and won’t, continue 
medical progress at the same wild 
gallop that has characterized the 
past fifty years of work. We have 
come within sight of discoveries that 
will make the achievements of the 
past half century look pale by com- 
parison — only to find the road 
blocked off by a great barrier. Noth- 
ing we have done in the past will 
help us to surmount that barrier, 
but we have reached a point where 
no other road will do. Far from 
rushing untrammeled through a 
Golden Age, medical research has 
reached the crossroads, and must 
find some fundamental answers be- 
fore it can go on. 

In essence, medical workers in 
the past fifty years have been go- 
ing about the countryside slaying 
all the little dragons they could 
find. They have been commend- 
ably successful — so much so, in- 
deed, that there aren’t very many 
little dragons left to slay. But it 
just happens that there are some big 
dragons around that we haven’t 
even touched yet. We don’t even 
know for sure what they look like, 

48 



much less how to go about slaying 
them. And these dragons are kill- 
ers — the group of disorders gener- 
ally known as the degenerative dis- 
eases, responsible among themselves 
for the vast majority of human 
death : 

Arteriosclerosis and heart disease. 
Hypertension. Cancer. We have 
names for them. That’s about all 
that we have. 

Of course, there are certain 
things we do know about these dis- 
eases — important things to con- 
sider in thinking about the future 
of our attempts to track them 
down. First, none of these diseases 
can be expected to yield to medi- 
cal research in the abrupt, dramatic 
manner of past medical triumphs. 
The reason lies in the peculiar na- 
ture of these disorders. 

With the infectious' diseases, or 
poliomyelitis, we were dealing with 
specific micro-organisms, vulner- 
able to specific drugs, medications, 
or antibodies capable of slowing or 
stopping their growth. With dia- 
betes mellitus a specific enzyme 
system was found to be at fault, for 
which a key enzyme could be sup- 
plied artificially once it was dis- 
covered and identified. But the de- 
generative diseases are not specific 
disorders of any organ or enzyme 
system. They are generalized dis- 
eases involving multiple organ sys- 
tems. In each of them we are deal- 
ing not with a sick kidney or a sick 
liver, but with a sick human body, 
suffering from a widespread mal- 
function of the fundamental physio- 
logical and biochemical processes 
of life. 

We can see, then, why no specific, 
ALAN E. NOURSE, M.D. 




simple, encapsulated answer is like- 
ly to be found for any of these 
vicious disorders. We’ve tried that 
already, and failed. Physicians have, 
for example, run the whole gamut 
of drugs which should, theoretically, 
bring down high blood pressure — 
but their patients continue to die of 
hypertensive cardiovascular dis- 
ease. We have tried everything 
imaginable to stop the wild, erratic 
growth of malignant cancer cells — 
but the cancers keep right on grow- 
ing. We have even resorted to sur- 
gery to try to replace the sclerotic 
blood vessels in human hearts — but 
we haven’t found any way to stop 
the steady march of arteriosclerosis 
in the aging human body. 

Gradually it has become appar- 
ent that the answers we need so 
desperately will never be found 
this way. These diseases will be 
stopped only when we understand 
what they are and why they hap- 
pen; to reach this goal it will be 
necessary for men to ferret out a 
complete basic understanding of the 
physiological and biochemical na- 
ture of life itself. 

This, then, is the great barrier 
to the Golden Age of medicine. It 
will not be surmounted in the next 
decade, nor even the next. We may 
well stand on the brink of a “bar- 
ren age” of medical progress — fifty 
or sixty years, maybe a hundred, of 
futile searching — before this great 
barrier begins to crumble. It will 
cost us stupendous sums of money 
and the finest minds we can pos- 
sibly recruit from the present and 
future generations, for we will find 
the answers only if we can develop 
and sustain the greatest concerted 

PROGNOSIS FOR TOMORROW 



search in the history of mankind. 

But the reward will be far greater 
than the mere ability to prevent or 
cure a group of human ailments. 
The knowledge we acquire in such 
a search will give us the weapons 
we need to fight the last enemy — 
Death — on his own grounds. It will 
place relative immortality within 
our reach : a useful, productive hu- 
man life-span measured in centuries 
rather than in decades. 

This will be the Golden Age of 
medicine. It could come in our 
time. 



I CERTAINLY DON’T wish to 
suggest, from the above, that I 
anticipate a Mexican stand-off in 
medicine for the next fifty years or 
so. There will be progress of one 
sort or another, and plenty of it. 
For one thing, all the little dragons 
aren’t slain yet by any means. A 
few of them that remain are quite 
unpleasant enough to deserve the 
continued attention of medical re- 
searchers for many years to come. 
Some, indeed, have never been 
truly dead, but continue to twitch 
their tails from time to time in a 
most annoying fashion. Others, only 
recently discovered, are drawing 
much attention to themselves — such 
nasty customers as the disease 
called lupus erythematosus, first 
recognized in the early 1930’s, a 
country cousin of rheumatic fever 
and rheumatoid arthritis, but dis- 
tinguished by its proclivity for kill- 
ing teen-aged girls and young wom- 
en. For another thing, and perhaps 
more important, many research pro- 
grams now under way show great 

49 




promise of providing at least some 
hope of palliation until the final 
answers are found. 

But if the answers coming from 
the laboratories and clinics in the 
next half century are not as star- 
tling and revolutionary as those 
in the past, we can anticipate that 
certain social and economic changes 
directly related to medicine will be. 
Some of these changes have al- 
ready begun, and their endpoint 
can be foreseen; others haven’t 
started yet, but are as logical as 
they are inevitable. 

First, we will see the emergence 
of greater and greater degrees of 
specialization and super-specializa- 
tion among practitioners of medi- 
cine. The sheer bulk of information 
and knowledge needed for success- 
ful diagnosis and treatment of ill- 
ness will force this trend to continue 
and grow. As a result, the concept 
of the “GP” and the “family doc- 
tor” will vanish completely, grieved 
for a while but soon forgotten. In 
its place clinic groups of trained 
specialists will burgeon, offering a 
far higher quality of medical care 
for far more people than the general 
practitioner could hope to supply. 
As an unfortunate but inevitable 
corollary, medical education will 
take longer and cost more in a time 
when more and more medically 
trained men and women are des- 
perately needed. 

Side by side with the trend to- 
ward super-specialization (have you 
ever heard of a pituitary osmore- 
ceptorologist? A specialist in the 
function of Paccinian Corpuscle? 
You haven’t? We’ve got ’em!) an- 
other phenomenon, already present, 

50 



will develop and expand rapidly: 
the consolidation of medical clinics 
and research laboratories into huge, 
centralized medical centers. Al- 
though such centers will grow up 
chiefly because of economic pres- 
sures, they will offer tremendous 
advantages to medical researchers. 
Diagnostic and research equipment^, 
as it becomes more refined, also be- 
comes more expensive. X-ray and 
fluoroscopic equipment, clinical 
laboratory facilities, electron micro- 
scopes, radioactive isotope facilities 
— all can be shared by many groups 
of workers in a centralized location, 
whereas their cost would be pro- 
hibitive in smaller installations. 
What is more, a large, consolidated 
medical center could effectively use 
another tool to ease the almost in- 
surmountable task of following cur- 
rent medical literature: electronic 
memory storage and computer 
mechanisms could be maintained, 
with trained crews to summarize 
medical journal material, catalogue 
it, store it, and make it quickly 
available to save researchers the 
days, weeks and months of almost 
totally unproductive reading they 
are so often forced to do just to 
keep up to date. 

Naturally, such installations will 
cost money, and lots of it. They 
will become not only research cen- 
ters but centers for diagnosis, treat- 
ment, and hospitalization of hun- 
dreds of thousands of patients an- 
nually. Medical insurance programs 
will help foot some small part of the 
bill, but sooner or later government 
support to help allay the costs of 
medical care and research will be- 
come mandatory. When that hap- 

ALAN E. NOURSE, M.D. 




pens it will come, paradoxically, 
without political control over the 
use of the money. This idea of pay- 
ing the Piper without any say about 
the tune to be played may well be 
revolting to a national government 
— just about as revolting as the very 
thought of government subsidy is to 
the medical profession — but stark 
necessity will force an uneasy truce. 
Medical work, with its basically 
humanitarian aims and goals, must 
not be allowed to become a political 
issue — witness the grisly example 
of Dr. Salk’s vaccine — and yet the 
search for the answers we must 
have will be too costly for private 
support. A truce will have to be 
made, and the resulting compro- 
mise may well be unique in the 
3000-year history of high finance! 

We will see other strange bed- 
fellows appearing. Already the 
radiologist is hard put to tell 
whether he is a physicist specializ- 
ing in medicine or a medical doctor 
specializing in physics. There was a 
time when the biochemist and the 
physiologist would have laughed 
at the suggestion that the electronic 
engineer might be able to offer 
them help; now they seek him out 
to build diagnostic and research 
machines for them. Lions and 
lambs, together they go, and the 
result is a broader scope for each, 
and perhaps a greater hope that the 
answers will, finally, be reached. 



T HIS IS ALL very nice, you may 
say, but it doesn’t help Granny 
with her rheumatism very much 
right now. There is every reason to 
believe that within a few decades 

PROGNOSIS FOR TOMORROW 



we will have answers that will put 
an end to Granny’s rheumatism 
once and for all — but what about 
the meantime? Unfortunately we 
don’t have those answers yet, and 
we do have Granny. It will hardly 
do to stand by and wring our hands 
as we wait, so to speak, for Arma- 
geddon. 

So the search goes on for answers 
applicable to human diseases and 
disorders here and now — palliative 
answers perhaps, almost always in- 
complete and tentative answers, but 
some kind of approach at least. 
This, then, will be the area of vis- 
ible progress in the forthcoming 
“barren age” of medicine. 

Again, we will see developments 
in two regions: the refinement of 
diagnostic and therapeutic tech- 
niques already known; and the 
search for techniques and methods 
not yet discovered. In the first cate- 
gory, it seems very likely that we 
will see massive enlargement and 
refinement of the gawky, imprac- 
tical present day mass-screening 
techniques for the early detection 
of such diseases as pulmonary tuber- 
culosis, cancer, gastro-intestinal 
ulcer, hypertension and kidney dis- 
ease. Such mass-screenings have al- 
ready been undertaken in certain of 
our cities — massive programs of 
chest X-rays to “screen” significant 
segments of the population for pul- 
monary tuberculosis, to cite a sin- 
gle example. Such programs have 
invariably been considered imprac- 
tical for wider use — but with our 
backs to the wall, any technique 
that offers hope of earlier diagnosis 
of cancer, for example, must be ex- 
amined most carefully. Ways can 

51 




be found to surmount the monu- 
mental cost of such programs; in- 
deed, another decade or so may see 
mass-screenings as a basic annual 
requirement of all hospitalization 
and life insurance contracts. 

In the past quarter century we 
have seen surgery come into its own 
with the development of techniques 
once thought 10 be either impossible 
or recklessly dangerous. Cardiac 
surgery, for instance, is now refined 
to such a degree that surgery of the 
heart is commonplace, and greater 
and greater daring is paying big 
dividends. But at best surgery of to- 
day is a pretty coarse proposition — 
excision of large masses or diseased 
organs, repair of large faults, in- 
cision and drainage of wounds and 
abscesses. Surgery has always been 
limited by the necessity of main- 
taining natural circulation of blood 
to the vital organs while the oper- 
ation goes on. But the next quarter 
century will see great progress in 
overcoming this barrier to surgical 
activity. Artificial kidneys and 
heart-lung machines will become 
part of every surgical armamentari- 
um. Artificial liver circulation sys- 
tems may even be developed. With 
such devices, in conjunction with 
hypo-thermic anaesthesia methods 
and drugs capable of slowing met- 
abolic processes throughout the 
body, micro-surgical techniques 
would be feasible. Tiny instruments, 
remotely controlled under micro- 
scopic visualization could be used, 
for instance, to separate cancer cells 
from surrounding normal tissue on 
a cell-by-cell basis, or for repair or 
replacement of tiny, deep-seated 
blood vessels in vital organs. At- 

52 



tempts have already been made to 
“seed” new coronary blood vessels 
into human hearts to replace dis- 
eased vessels, without significant 
success; micro-techniques would al- 
low implanting and grafting of 
tiny, healthy vessels deep in heart 
muscle to replace the old, sclerotic 
vessels. Portions of liver or kidney* 
could be excised or repaired with- 
out damage to surrounding healthy 
cells. Technically impossible today, 
such procedures may become com- 
monplace as soon as the proper 
tools are made. Here again the 
medical researcher and the engineer 
will work cheek by jowl to do a job 
neither can do by himself. 

Cancer is, of course, the target 
of concerted attack from all sides 
in medicine today. The many faces 
it shows, its inexorable march to 
fatality once started, the very alien 
nature of its growth within the hu- 
man body, all make it a fearful 
enemy to human life. Yet, para- 
doxically, the very nature of can- 
cerous growth — wild, disordered, 
spreading to any type of tissue 
within the body, even surviving 
transplantation from body to body 
— may provide another weapon 
against the diseases of degenera- 
tion: the artificial culturing and 
transplanting of whole prosthetic 
organs to replace old, dying ones. 
Again, an exciting challenge, tech- 
nically impossible today, which may 
come within the realm of reason to- 
morrow. 

As for new drugs, the parade con- 
tinues, often to the exhaustion of 
our patience. But along with the 
new drugs, new concepts of drug 
usage are slowly emerging. The 

ALAN E. NOURSE, M.D. 




strange behavior of the adrenal cor- 
tical steroids and other hormonal 
substances are suggesting tantaliz- 
ing new possibilities to medical re- 
searchers. Imagine a drug which 
gives the best therapeutic effect 
when it is taken by the doctor 
rather than the patient! Yet this 
is exactly the way the lysergic acid 
derivatives are being used in deal- 
ing with schizophrenia. Gradually 
the classical uses of drugs are be- 
ing reinforced by unknown and un- 
tried methods of use. 



I N THE foregoing I have deliber- 
ately avoided much comment on 
the future attack on mental ill- 
ness, chiefly because I cannot 
find a good, solid, logical jumping- 
off place from which to start specu- 
lating. Speculation might be inter- 
esting, but it would necessarily be 
wild, and right now I’m trying to 
keep my feet within kicking distance 
of the ground. 

But in speculating on any future 
development in medicine or allied 
fields we must recognize the pres- 
ence of another factor at work — a 
factor so staggeringly important 
that it is perhaps the single greatest 
shaper of the future, yet so unpre- 
dictable that it utterly defies specu- 
lation. This factor has been called 
the principle of serendipity . In his 
essays Horace Walpole described 
the journeys of three hypothetical 
Princes of Serendib (an ancient 
name for Ceylon) who traveled in 
quest of things they never succeeded 
in finding, but discovered along 
the way many things which turned 
out to be better than what they 

PROGNOSIS FOR TOMORROW 



were looking for. The lucky coin- 
cidences that occur and lead to the 
great medical discoveries, the un- 
predictable variables that make any 
speculation seem timid and con- 
servative — this factor of serendipity 
exercises an overwhelming influence 
on the direction of medical progress. 
Penicillin was discovered by grace 
of serendipity: the spores of peni- 
cillium notatum which blew in 
Fleming’s window were nothing 
more than an annoying contami- 
nant of his bacteria cultures, and it 
took him twelve years to realize 
what had actually happened ,to 
him — but it changed history when 
he finally woke up. Practically every 
medical discovery in history has 
had some degree of serendipity in- 
volved. It is a process which is con- 
stantly at work — erratic, undepend- 
able, upsetting orderly experiments 
in the most annoying fashion, yet 
opening doors we never even 
dreamed existed before. 

So speculation is only of limited 
value even when based on the firm- 
est ground. Nevertheless, I feel sure 
that one thing is clear: medicine 
today stands at the crossroads. We 
are emerging, only now, from a 
great darkness, and ahead we can 
see the barest glimmer of light. The 
Golden Age of medicine, when it 
arrives, will bring problems of un- 
imaginable proportions; the social 
and economic implications of physi- 
cal immortality are stupendous. It 
will bring the potential for wisdom, 
or for cataclysm. It will bring the 
stars within reach. We stand on the 
brink of discovery — we will live to 
see it, to participate in it. • • •

T HE ROOM seemed more a mausoleum than an office, 
but that was as had been intended. Perhaps thirty feet 
high, fifty feet wide, it stretched a good hundred feet in 
length. It was paneled entirely in jet black onyx, which 
gave a sense of infinity to it. The floor was a thick lawn of 
heavy black pile carpeting. Only two areas of the room of- 
fered mitigation to this oppressive gloom. Just past the mid- 
dle, bathed in a haze of light, was placed a large black desk, 



55 



and behind it sat a man. At the far 
end of the room, slightly elevated, 
was an alabaster statue, an abstrac- 
tion of incredible beauty and poign- 
ancy. The statue too was wrapped 
in a soft nimbus. Few visitors to 
this room ever had to be told the 
title of this work of art, for its 
meaning was apparent in its every 
line — Bereavement . 

The man behind the big black 
desk belonged to the room as much 
as did the onyx walls, the thick car- 
pet or the alabaster statue. Without 
the presence of this man the cham- 
ber seemed strangely empty, 
strangely morbid, and few of the 
man’s associates cared to remain in 
the room when he was not there. 
Somehow the warm air of benevo- 
lence to be found in his fair, pink- 
ish face softened the harsh somber- 
ness of the appointments, while the 
gentle strength in his dark and 
mournful eyes gave amelioration to 
the atmosphere of despair. His job 
was to be a Janus, looking from the 
cheery rubric of today towards the 
unknown but dimmer colors of to- 
morrow — to be a bridge between 
present pleasures and future fears. 
There was no better man for the 
task in all the Galaxy than Consola- 
tor Steen. 

At the moment Consolator Steen 
sat waiting, thinking, planning. 
Soon through the huge doors fac- 
ing him would come a man, one 
Joseph Krieg by name, who sought 
Steen’s assistance. The fact that 
Krieg was one of the richest men in 
all the known universe made the 
impending interview a most impor- 
tant one, for Consolator Steen’s as- 
sistance depended entirely upon the 

56 



price that could be paid. 

Steen’s fingers flicked over the 
set of hidden controls on his desk. 
Everything was in readiness. “And 
another innocent fish gets hooked,” 
he muttered to himself. He sighed 
once, shortly, then touched an in- 
visible button. will see Joseph 
Krieg now.” In ther outer office 
Steen’s aide-de-camp, Assistant 
Consolator Braun, sprang to an at- 
titude of proper deference as the 
huge bronze doors swung open. 
Braun bowed slightly as Joseph 
Krieg strode past him and into the 
onyx chamber. 

Steen’s eyes narrowed in admira- 
tion as he examined the man walk- 
ing towards him. Joseph Krieg was 
a huge person, just past middle age 
but still retaining the hardened ap- 
pearance of late youth. His face* 
had a chiseled squareness to it, and 
his manner indicated not so much 
wealth as it did an obvious deter- 
mination to succeed. This would 
be an interesting fish to play with 
indeed, Steen thought. 

About half-way to the desk Krieg 
stumbled slightly, but recovered his 
pace with the cumbersome grace of 
some massive animal. A smile flick- 
ered briefly over Steen’s face. The 
thickness of the carpet had more 
purposes than one. When Krieg 
was almost upon him, Steen stood 
up. 

Krieg stopped in front of the 
desk, facing Steen, as if waiting for 
some signal. Steen, who knew the 
value of silence, remained absolute- 
ly still. After a few seconds, 
obviously perplexed, Krieg smiled 
nervously. “Consolator Steen?” 

james McConnell 




“Welcome to Earth, Joseph 
Krieg. Welcome to the Heart of 
the Galaxy.” Steen’s voice was rich, 
mellifluous, and the words fell from 
his mouth like benedictions. He ex- 
tended a hand. “Won’t you please 
be seated?” 

The chair received Krieg’s body 
as if it were the most precious bur- 
den it had ever held. It's soft con- 
tours almost demanded that he re- 
lax, yield the tenseness of his mus- 
cles to its smooth and welcoming 
shape. Its surface closed around 
him as if it were a second skin, then 
began to tingle in gentle caress. Jo- 
seph Krieg had never felt so com- 
forted in his life. 

Consolator Steen seated himself 
behind his desk, then waited until 
his assistant, Braun, had taken a 
chair some feet away. He smiled 
paternally. “May I ask you one 
favor? Would it seem presump- 
tuous if I called you Joseph? Per- 
haps you would feel it an imperti- 
nence on my part, but . .” Con- 
solator Steen gestured slightly with 
both his hands, as if to implore 
forgiveness. 

Joseph Krieg smiled, nodded his 
head. “Of course I won’t mind if 
you use my first name. It would be 
an honor, Sir.” The smile contin- 
ued on his face, but his eyes nar- 
rowed as if fie were attempting to 
puzzle out the figure behind the 
desk. 

“You will excuse me too if I say 
that you’ve come too soon, Joseph,” 
the Consolator said. 

“Too soon?” Krieg replied quizz- 
ically. “I don’t think I . .” 

Steen smiled warmly. “I only 
mean that you look still so young, 

NOR DUST CORRUPT 



so strong and vibrant with life. And 
yet, perhaps you are the wiser to 
come now, still in the vigor of liv- 
ing. It shows an honesty with your- 
self, an ability to face the facts, 
which is much to be admired.” 

“Thank you, Sir,” Krieg replied. 
He continued to stare at the Con- 
solator. 

Steen knew full well the turmoil 
that was stirring within the man. 
The entire interview had been psy- 
chologically planned to evoke dark 
and dormant emotions which, when 
released, would destroy Krieg’s nor- 
mal ability to judge situations im- 
passively. Proof that things were 
going as intended came from 
Krieg’s continual use of the word 
“Sir.” Krieg’s commercial empires 
spanned the Universe; from per- 
fume to starships, from food to fer- 
tilizers, he was king. And yet he 
would never understand that it was 
Steen’s quiet paternal power, the 
fact that he wore wise sorrow 
wrapped around him the way some 
men wear a cloak, that called 
forth this unfamiliar reverence. 
The psychological survey done on 
Krieg had cost the Consolator a 
small fortune, and he didn’t intend 
to waste it. 

“You must realize, Joseph, that 
the things which you have come to 
discuss are matters of the deepest 
concern for all of us here on 
Earth.” Steen gesticulated towards 
Braun as if Braun represented 
somehow all the other billions on 
Earth. “The problem is one that 
touches deep within all of us, and 
we are anxious to be of whatever 
service possible. But more than any- 
thing else, we want you to know 

57 




that we understand ” 

“Thank you, Sir,” Krieg repeat- 
ed. He frowned for a moment, then 
seemed to smile. “But if you don’t 
mind, maybe we could begin our 
discussion of terms.” 

Steen raised one eyebrow slightly. 
The man showed a remarkable lack 
of sentimentality. Corrections would 
have to be made in the ap- 
proach ♦ . 

“Of course. I am delighted to get 
on with things. And I must say, I 
find your attitude extraordinarily 
sane. The problem is, really, a sim- 
ple one best met head on. You are 
here because you know that as it 
come to all men, death must come 
to you too. And you feel the neces- 
sity to make certain that when your 
time comes, you will be-brought to 
Earth to your final rest. You are a 
son of Earth. This is your great an- 
cestral home.” 

Krieg started slightly, then re- 
laxed almost in reverie. Steen 
smiled inwardly at the power of 
words, repeated, to invoke long for- 
gotten memories. For Steen knew 
that when Krieg had been no more 
than a toddling child, learning to 
read, learning to respond to affec- 
tion, his simple-syllabled books had 
spoken in reverent tones of “The 
Great Ancestral Home.” In later 
years, all of Krieg’ s studies had had 
hidden at their core an emotional 
dependence upon Earth. No place 
was finer, more beauitful, more im- 
portant. No, not all the rest of the 
stars put together. He had been 
told it a million times until it had 
become an inseparable part of his 
very personality, just so the words 
would have the desired effect at 

58 



this moment. The Great Ancestral 
Home . 

“You are so fortunate, my son,” 
the Consolator continued. “So very 
few of Earth’s teeming children will 
ever ha^e the opportunity that lies 
within your' grasp. You must make 
the most of it.” 

As Steen watched, Krieg seemed 
to shake some of the feelihg of awe 
from him. “I intend to make the 
most of it, Sir,” he said, offering 
Steen his most charming smile. “It 
just depends on how hard a bargain 
you want to drive.” 

Consolator Steen gave Krieg a 
look of mild reproach. “There is 
no ‘bargaining’ to be done, Joseph. 
The monetary considerations are 
set by law, and we have no choice 
in the matter. All that we can do is 
to explain the services which we are 
prepared to extend to you, and 
then help you as best we can to ar- 
rive at the most suitable decision. 
Our position is simply that of cater- 
ing to your individual wants as best 
we can.” 

“My wants are simple,” Krieg re- 
plied, and it seemed to Steen that 
far too much of the man’s usual 
forcefulness was returning to his 
voice. “I wish to be buried on 
Earth when I die, and I want you 
to arrange this for m£.” 

“Of course, of course, my son,” 
Steen said, letting just a glint of 
steel appear in his eyes. “But what 
do we mean by burial? We have 
such different problems here on 
Earth than you do elsewhere in the 
Galaxy. You must understand that. 
We are forced to such strange so- 
lutions to these problems. But per- 
haps if I merely show you the vari- 

james McConnell 




ons types of burial which we under- 
take, then you will understand.” 
Steen laughed to himself. The fish 
appeared fat and hungry, and now 
it was time to drop in the bait. 

The Consolator touched a hid- 
den switch atop his desk and one of 
the black onyx walls rippled and 
seemed to dissolve in mist. A rep- 
lica of Earth swam through the 
haze and into view. “Earth. Such 
an incredibly small planet, Joseph. 
But the heart of the Galaxy none 
the less.” The replica seemed to 
swell in size and geographical de- 
tails became apparent. “Earth. 
Once a world of gentle, rolling 
plains, winding rivers, thick forests, 
wide oceans and soaring mountains. 
Just like any other habitable planet. 
And now look at it. One solid mass 
of buildings and machines, Joseph. 
We’ve drained the oceans and filled 
in their beds with metal. We’ve de- 
stroyed the forests and the rolling 
plains and planted the land for 
milefc above and below with throb- 
bing inorganic monsters. We’ve hol- 
lowed out the very mountains to 
make more space. Space for nine 
hundred billion people, Joseph. 
And still we are cramped almost 
beyond belief. We need to expand 
a hundredfold. But we cannot. 
There simply is no room left. 

“No room for the living, Joseph, 
and this means no more room for 
the dead, either. Here, let me show 
you.” The scene changed, showing 
first a huge building, and then, the 
bottom floor of the edifice. “This 
is one of our larger buildings, Jo- 
seph. It is more than fifty miles 
long and one hundred miles wide. 

NOR DUST CORRUPT 



The bottom floor alone is more 
than one quarter mile high. This 
huge space is completely filled with 
cubes two inches square. Each cube 
holds the ashes of one human being 
who wished to find his final resting 
place on Earth.” 

Consolator Steen made a motion 
of resignation. “Notice that I said 
‘on Earth,’ Joseph, and not ‘in 
Earth.’ This is our ‘pauper’s field,’ 
the burial ground of those devoted 
souls who could not afford to be 
buried in the Earth itself.” 

Joseph Krieg frowned. “But sure- 
ly underneath the building . .” 
“Underneath the bottom floor 
of that building are the bodies of 
many millions more, Joseph, just 
as there are bodies under all of 
our buildings. Bodies of those 
wealthy few who could afford to 
escape cremation and find surcease 
of life in the loamy substance of 
the Earth itself. I shudder to tell 
you how tightly packed they are, of 
the skin-tight coffins which we had 
to devise, of the geometrical tricks 
involved in jamming as many 
bodies as possible in the least 
amount of space. And yet, it is 
burial, and it is in the Earth itself. 
No granite monuments, of course, 
no vases of flowers, no green grass. 
Just a perpetual flame burning in 
the main lobby of the building, and 
a micro-film file available some- 
where listing the vital statistics of 
all those souls whose remains lie in 
the basement — or below.” 

Krieg’ s face was furrowed with 
a heavy frown. Steen’s words had 
been as shocking to the man as 
Steen had hoped they would be. 
“But the Parks . .” 



59 




“Ah, yes, Joseph. The Parks . ” 
Consolator Steen leaned forward 
slightly. The fish was sniffing at the 
bait quite properly now. “Our 
Parks, which are the one remaining 
link with the past. Those green arjl 
grassy meadows in the midst of our 
metallic forests. The last places on 
Earth where you can be buried out 
in the open, with flowers over your 
head and birds singing above. You 
want to be buried in one of the 
Parks, don’t you Joseph?” When 
the man nodded briefly, Steen con- 
tinued. “Which Park, Joseph?” 

“Manhattan . 

Steen drew himself up with S 
sudden, silent movement. The fish 
had taken a good look at the bait. 
Now to remove it from sight for 
a while. Steen closed his eyes brief- 
ly, then raised a hand as if to brush 
away a sudden tear. “I’m sorry, Joe. 
Very sorry indeed. I was afraid that 
was what you wanted, and yet, there 
was always . .” He blinked his 
eyes. “Manhattan Park is impos- 
sible, Joe. Confucius Park in Hong 
Kong, perhaps. I think there are 
still same plots available in Frog- 
ner Park in Oslo. I’m certain that 
we could get you into Amundsen 
Park at the South Pole. But Man- 
hattan . No, Joe. That’s one 
dream I’m afraid you’ll just have to 
give up.” 

“Why?” Joseph Krieg asked 
quietly but determinedly. 

“Have you ever seen it, Joe? I 
thought not. It’s perhaps the most 
beautiful part of this most beautiful 
planet in the Galaxy. Would you 
like to see Manhattan?” 

Manhattan . Steen was quite 
aware that to Joseph Krieg this was 



a word of a hundred thousand as- 
sociations, each of them connected 
with love, security, devotion and 
repose. It was like asking a starv- 
ing man if he would care for some- 
thing to eat. 

Steen did not even wait for a re- 
ply. /T think it could be managed, 
as a special favor. Permission to en- 
ter Manhattan Park is difficult to 
get, you know, but I think this once 
. .” Steen turned to Braun. “Put a 
call through to the President’s of- 
fice . .” 



A TOP GRASSY knolls, supple 
willows trailed languid branches 
to the ground. Silver-throated birds 
sang secret melodies while *^>ees 
hummed a scarcely audible back- 
ground. Narrow graveled paths 
wound through this gentle land- 
scape, now hugging the edge of a 
tinkling stream, now plunging 
through carpets of gorgeous flow- 
ers. The three men sat silent on a 
rough stone bench observing the 
pastoral scene. 

Finally Consolator Steen spoke 
softly. “I understand how you feel, 
Joe. The first time any of us sees 
it, we are afflicted with silence. Its 
beauty is almost painful, the memo- 
ries it invokes almost beyond bear- 
ing. Lincoln is buried there, just be- 
yond that hillock; Landowski not 
far from him. Shakespeare’s grave 
is there to the right, and close by is 
the body of Sharon, the poet of t^ie 
Galaxy. Einstein’s final resting place 
is a mile or so away, and near to it 
you’ll find Chi Wan, who gave us 
Stardrive. Humanity’s Valhalla,

Joseph Krieg had not cried open- 
ly since childhood, and yet now 
there were tears in his eyes. “This 
has always been my dream . .” 
Consolator Steen placed a friend- 
ly arm around the man’s shoulders. 
“Yes, now you have seen it. Your 
dream has come true.” He paused 
for just a moment, then said, “And 
now, Joe, perhaps we had better 
g°- 

Joseph Krieg turned towards the 
man with an abrupt motion. “Go? 
Why should we go? We’ve been 
here scarcely ten minutes.” 

“Because the longer you stay, the 
harder it will be for you to leave, 
Joe. And the less attractive the 
ether parks will seem to you. So, 
I’d like for us to leave at once.” His 
voice became businesslike. “First, 
I’d like to show you Hong Kong, 
and then . 

“I don’t want to see Hong Kong, 
or any place else. This is where I 
want to be buried, Steen. Whatever 
the price is, I’ll pay.” 

Consolator Steen sighed deeply. 
“I don’t think you understand, Joe. 
It isn’t a matter of price. Manhat- 
tan is simply not available to you, 
for the reason that it is not for 
sale. I know that you have heard 
otherwise; I am sure that rumors 
have reached your ears that burial 
in Manhattan could be effected for 
a mere trillion credits. But these 
fantastic tales are incorrect — for 
two reasons. 

“The first reason, Joe, is a finan- 
cial one. To the average man, a 
mere million credits is such a gigan- 
tic, unobtainable sum that he is 
sure anything in the Galaxy could 
be obtained for a trillion. This is 



not so, as you and I both know. 
Why, a million credits will scarcely 
get you a burial in a two-inch- 
square cube in the bottom floor of 
one of our huge buildings. Remem- 
ber? I called those huge bargain 
basements ‘pauper’s fields.’ And 
that they are — available to those 
poor jpeople throughout the Uni- 
verse who have only a few millions 
to their names. Incredible, isn’t it? 

“A trillion credits? Why, it takes 
a hundred billion to make you eligi- 
ble for burial under one of the 
buildings, where you’re packed in 
like a sardine with millions of other 
bodies. And how many people in 
the Galaxy can lay their hands on a 
hundred billion credits? The an- 
swer, Joe, is too many people in- 
deed. Some of them have so much 
more money than that, they can ac- 
tually afford to be buried in one of 
the Parks. 

“A trillion credits? Yes, that will 
get you buried in Hong Kong Park, 
or in Frogner, or Amundsen. But 
not for long. You can rent a tem- 
porary grave in Hong Kong, for 
example, for a mere billion credits 
a day. At that rate, for a trillion 
credits, you’d stay buried on Earth 
for less than three years, and then 
your body would have to be moved 
elsewhere. Very few people can 
afford to purchase a permanent 
plot in one of these parks. But they 
are available — at a cost of some- 
thing like one quadrillion credits. 
And just how many men in the 
Galaxy have a quadrillion credits 
or so?” 

Consolator Steen knew the an- 
swer to this question exactly — he 
also knew that Joseph Krieg was 

61 



NOR DUST CORRUPT 




one of these men. Krieg could have 
afforded a quadrillion credits, but it 
would have exhausted his fortune. 
Steen waited until he was tjre that 
the other man was deep in mental 
turmoil and then he continued, Iris 
voice now softer, less commercial 
sounding. “And having given you 
‘the prices,’ so to speak, of the lesser 
treasures, I will now surprise you by 
saying that the entry ticket to Man- 
hattan Park is free.” 

Joseph Krieg looked at the man 
intently, a curious fire of hope in his 
eyes. “Free?” 

Steen nodded. “And because it is 
free, it is unobtainable. It is not 
generally known, Joe, but the only 
way one can be buried in Manhat- 
tan Park is by permission of the 
Galactic Congress. Only certified 
heroes are so honored, and they are 
few and far between. Remember 
the great bacteriologist Manuel de 
Artega? It took the Galactic Con- 
gress more than fifty years of de- 
bate after he died to decide 
to let him in — but after all, the 
only claim to fame he had was 
that he saved a few trillion lives 
from the Green Plague. He was 
buried here some thirteen years ago. 
There has been no one since, and 
no one in sight.” 

Steen patted the man on the 
shoulder. “Now, come along, Joe. I 
want you to take a look at Amund- 
sen Park before you make up your 
mind. It’s not at all cold at 
the Pole these days — lovely flowers, 
trees . .” 

“No!” Joseph Krieg cried, stand- 
ing up. Steen and Braun both rose 
too. “There must be a way!” 

The Consolator smiled inwardly. 



The fish was responding magnifi- 
cently, Now to push the bait just a 
little closer . 

“Now, now, Joe. You mustn’t get 
upset about this. The other Parks 
are just as fine, I assure you,” Steen 
murmured in consolation. 

Krieg shook his head. “You can’t 
tell me that sometime or other 
someone didn’t buy his way into 
Manhattan. It stands to reason . .” 

“Now, Joe. You’re taking this 
much too hard . 

“I tell you, I know people. And 
that’s aK-the Galactic Congress is 
made up of — people. Tell me the 
truth, Steen. Has anyone ever 
bribed his way into this Park?” 

Steen frowned and turned his 
head slightly away from the man. 
Just a flick or two more of the 
line . 

“I wish you wouldn’t ask me 
questions like that, Joe. When I say 
that it’s impossible, I mean just 
that. You’ll just excite yourself 
needlessly by listening to foolish 
rumors . .” 

Krieg pounced on the word jubi- 
lantly. “What do you mean, ru- 
mors? Then there has been some- 
one who bought his way in! Who 
was it, Steen? I swear, if you don’t 
tell me, I’ll move heaven and earth 
to find out.” 

Consolator Steen seemed to con- 
sider for a moment, then sighed. 
Hooked . “All right, Joe. But believe 
me, you’ll wish you hadn’t asked. 
For what happened to ... to this 
other person is unattainable to 
you.” 

“Who was it?” Krieg asked excit- 
edly. 



62 



james McConnell 




“Who was the richest man who 
ever lived, Joe?” 

“You mean . .” 

“Who was it that founded the 
University you went to, the hos- 
pital in which you were born? Who 
gave a magnificent library to every 
city in the known universe, who 
was it . .” 

Krieg interrupted. “Old C. T. 
himself . 

Steen nodded. “Yes, old C. T. 
Anderman himself. Years ago, Joe, 
he faced the same problem you face 
now, and he reacted the same way 
you have. So he set out on a cam- 
paign to get into Manhattan the 
only way he knew how — with 
money. There was one difference, 
Joe. Where you are fabulously 
wealthy, C. T. Anderman was 
wealthy beyond all dreams. Do you 
know that he gave away more than 
one quintillion credits — gave it 
away ! Just to make his name uni- 
versally known. ‘The Philanthro- 
pist of the Galaxy,’ they called him. 
One quintillion credits! No wonder 
they voted him a hero’s grave. But 
what the press and the public never 
knew is that it cost him more than 
twice that much — for he had to 
spend another one quintillion 
credits for bribes and influence. It 
took him fifty years, Joe, to pack 
the Galactic Congress with enough 
of his men to swing the trick. But 
he finally did it.” 

There was a short silence, then 
Steen continued. “Now you see why 
I didn’t want to tell you, Joe — to 
raise false hopes. Only one man in 
the Galaxy was ever wealthy enough 
to buy his way into Manhattan. 
And he had to give up his entire 

NOR DUST CORRUPT 



fortune to do it. I’m afraid that 
you’ll never make the grade, Joe.” 

Krieg stood stunned. Steen was 
aware that two quintillion credits 
was beyond Krieg’ s wildest dreams, 
for Steen knew that Joseph Krieg 
had come to Earth determined to 
purchase his burial lot and then re- 
tire from the business world. 

Steen pulled lightly at Krieg’s 
arm. “Now, come along, Joe. Let’s 
go take a look at Hong Kong.” 
The three men started off down the 
path, but before they had gone ten 
feet, a robot scurried out of the 
bushes and dashed over to the 
bench they had been sitting on. It 
clucked softly to itself, put forth 
several arms, and in a matter of 
seconds had completely washed and 
disinfected the bench. 

Joseph Krieg, an empty and 
numb look on his face, stopped to 
watch the process. He stared for a 
few seconds, then asked hoarsely, 
“What’s that?” 

Consolator Steen smiled. “One of 
the Guardians, Joe. Superb— and 
completely incorruptible. Within 
minutes after we leave, every ves- 
tige of our visit will be gone — each 
piece of gravel we tread on will be 
scrubbed clean or replaced, each 
piece of grass we touch uprooted 
and destroyed, even the very air we 
breathe will be sterilized to remove 
our traces. We have our problem 
of vandals too, you know,” Steen 
said, a wisp of a smile playing about 
the corners of his mouth. “But these 
are vandals who want to get in and 
leave something, not like those of 
ancient times on Earth who broke 
into burial grounds to loot and de- 
stroy. Yes, Joe, we found long ago 

63 




that the only safe method was to 
employ mechanical devices to guard 
against clandestine burials. So even 
the gardeners who keep this Park 
in blossom are mechanical. See, 
there’s another one over there, hard 
at work.” 

Joseph Krieg turned and saw to 
one side, by a large bed of red 
flowers, another robot with dozens 
of visible appendages. It purred an 
almost silent tune as it clipped and 
pruned, dug and spaded, trimmed 
and cleaned the beds, occasionally 
sprinkling a rich fertilizer dust here 
and there. 

“The Guardians of Valhalla, Joe. 
They were set into motion centuries 
ago, and not even the President 
knows how to change their orders. 
They can’t be bribed, even if their 
human masters can be.” 

Joseph Krieg stooped down be- 
side the bed of flowers. He reached 
out and picked up a handful of the 
fine dirt and let it slip pensively 
through his fingers. “Dust unto 
dust,” he said slowly. “Man was 
created from the soil of Earth, and 
to dust he returneth.” There was a 
long silence as Steen let the emo- 
tion run its course. Then he touched 
Krieg lightly on the arm and the 
man stood up again. They started 
off down the path, ignoring the 
machine that skittered along behind 
them, cleansing each bit of gravel 
they stepped upon. 

To Steen, this was always the 
most important part of the inter- 
view. While the fish was masticat- 
ing the bait, he had to prattle on 
to keep the hook from becoming 
too visible. “Some day I must tell 
you of all the ways people have 

64 



tried to get themselves buried on 
Earth without paying for the privi- 
lege, Joe. It makes a fascinating 
story. We’re in a difficult position 
here, you know, for we have to im- 
port every single bit of food we eat, 
every machine we use, each piece of 
clothing that we wear. But every 
single item that we import is care- 
fully scanned to make sure that no 
one has concealed so much as a 
single human hair in the process.” 
Steen watched Krieg’s face closely 
as they walked. The man should 
be going through hell just now, but 
not too much of it showed on his 
face. Steen continued his prattle, a 
little puzzled. 

“Oh, it’s incredible the ways that 
people have tried to cheat. Some of 
the methods used are too ugly to 
relate, some of them humorous be- 
yond belief. But this is why we’ve 
resorted to mechanical guards all 
the way round — to maintain our 
incorruptibility. Even Anderman 
with all of his quintillions could not 
have bribed his way past our ma- 
chines.” Steen’s voice betrayed none 
of the anxiety that he felt. For 
Joseph Krieg was almost smiling 
now, was apparently feeling none 
of the great confusion that Steen 
had counted upon. 

They reached the gates. “Well, 
Joe. I think we’ll head straight for 
Hong Kong, if you don’t mind. It 
will be early morning there by now, 
and that’s the best time . .” 

Joseph Krieg turned to face the 
man. “Thank you very much, Con- 
solator, but I don’t think that will 
be necessary. You see, I’ve changed 
my mind.” 

Steen repressed a frown. 

james McConnell 




“Changed your mind?” he asked 
blandly. 

“Yes. After giving it due con- 
sideration, I think that it would be 
foolish to squander all of my for- 
tune on a burial on Earth. My fam- 
ily would be cheated out of its in- 
heritance if I did, and after all, if 
my sons carry on in their father’s 
tradition, that’s enough for me.” 
Krieg extended his hand. “I wish 
to thank you, Steen, for your kind- 
ness. I regret that I have troubled 
you for nothing.” 

Steen shook the man’s hand 
warmly, using his free hand to grasp 
Krieg’s arm in friendly fashion. “It 
was no trouble at all, I assure you. 
But please understand, Joseph, if 
I can ever be of service to you in 
any way, if I can ever be of assist- 
ance in any manner whatsoever, 
please do not hesitate to call upon 
me. After all, even Anderman had 
certain problems which . .” Steen 
smiled knowingly. 

Krieg returned the smile. “I 
think I understand. And I appreci- 
ate your offer, although I must tell 
you that there is little likelihood 
that I will be forced to take it up. 
Again my thanks. And now, good- 
bye.” Krieg turned and strode 
through the gates. 

C ONSOLATOR STEEN and his 
assistant, Braun, stood watching 
the man as he disappeared into the 
distance. Then Steen turned and 
walked oyer to one of the benches 
in the Park near to the gates. He 
sat down wearily. 

“Braun,” he said. “I don’t like it. 
Not at all. He should have been be- 



side himself with worry, he should 
have pumped me for more informa- 
tion, he should have done a thou- 
sand other things. But he didn’t. He 
just turned and left. I tell you, I 
don’t like it at all.” 

Braun frowned. “He seemed to 
take the bait, Sir.” 

“And then, after sniffing it over 
carefully, he turned and spat it 
right back in our faces. We can’t 
afford mistakes like this, Braun. 
Earth needs the money too badly. 
It’s our only means of support, and 
we can’t let a fish like Krieg get off 
the hook.” 

“There are other fish around. 
Sir.” 

Steen’s face took on an angry 
look. “Of course there are. But 
none with the potentialities that 
Krieg showed. Don’t you realize 
that ever since that sad day when 
Earth realized that she was a has- 
been, she’s had to take advantage 
of every single opportunity offered 
her, just to keep alive? Oh, they 
were clever, those ancient ones who 
realized that if a civilization is to 
be kept together, it must have a 
myth. And so they gave our civiliza- 
tion its myth — that of Earth, the 
Great Ancestral Home. Just acci- 
dentally, it also offered Earth a 
means of retaining at least a part 
of her power.” 

Steen waved his hands in the air. 
“From an economic viewpoint it 
was nice too. Only the very wealthy 
'could afford an Earth burial, and 
so it became a means of hidden, 
graduated taxation — Earth soaked 
the rich and ignored the poor, and 
cut her overt taxes while doing so. 
Burial became so costly that it

helped break up the huge Estates, 
it helped leaven out the wealth. 
Our propaganda was sharpened to 
the point where we could take a 
man like Anderman and drive him 
all of his life towards an almost un- 
attainable goal, force him to ex- 
pend his tremendous energies in the 
accumulation of great wealth 4 '' ex- 
tending the frontiers of the Galaxy 
as he did so, building up our civili- 
zation’s strength in the process, and 
then, in the end, make him turn all 
of his wealth over to Earth in one 
form or another. Oh, I tell you, 
Braun, those ancient ones were 
clever.” 

The tirade halted. The air hung 
silent for a moment, and the twit- 
tering of a near-by bird could be 
heard. 

“They were very, very clever. 
They gave us all the tools, and 
somehow we’ve failed to use them 
correctly. What was it, Braun? 
What did we do, or fail to do, that 
let Krieg get away from us?” 

Braun frowned. “I don’t know, 
Sir. Perhaps he just changed his 
mind about Earth.” 

Steen snorted. “Impossible! He’s 
had too many years’ exposure to 
our propaganda for that. He can 
no more give up his dream of burial 
in Manhattan than he can give up 
his very personality. No, Braun, I 
think we just underestimated the 
man. Somewhere along the line he 
had an idea, he saw something that 
we failed to see. 

Braun shrugged his shoulders. 
“But what are we going to do 
about it?” 

Gonsolator Steen pursed his lips. 
“I tell you what I’m going to do 



about it. I’m going straight back 
to the office and sit and think, and 
think, and then think some more. 
Krieg’ s got a good fifty years ahead 
of him yet, and that means I’ve got 
exactly that long to guess what’s on 
his mind. I’ll get that quintillion 
credits if it’s the last thing I do.” 

They had no more than reached 
the gate when one of the mechani- 
cal Guardians appeared from be- 
hind a bush, chortled to itself and 
scurried over to the bench. It 
cleansed the rough-hewn stone, 
then washed the path the two men 
had taken. Then, its exceptional 
chores accomplished, it went back 
to its normal pursuits. 

It approached a bed of begonias 
nearby. One appendage extended 
itself and began digging up the dirt 
around the plants. Meanwhile, in- 
side the machine, other appendages 
ripped open a small bag and spilled 
the fine dust inside the bag into a 
small trough. The empty bag was 
rolled up and stuck in a disposal 
bin along with several other bags, 
all with identical markings: 

JOSEPH KRIEG AND SONS, 

BY APPOINTMENT, 
PURVEYORS OF FINE 
FERTILIZERS 

TO THE GALACTIC GOVERN- 
MENT ON EARTH 

The machine clucked quietly to 
itself as it sprinkled the dust evenly 
over the black, yielding earth. It 
patted the fertilizer gently into the 
rich soil, making sure that each 
plant got its fair share. Then it 
scurried off silently to tend to a bed 
of calla lilies nearby. • • •

It’s been said that the soul is the 



form that makes the body — which may 



just possibly explain what happened 



on that fatal day at Ivy College . 



THE OLD GOAT 



BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



D R. ANGSTROM was known to his stu- 
dents and many of his colleagues on the 
faculty as “The Old Goat.” Very appropriate, 
that name. He had the disposition of a goat 
with dyspepsia, he had the cold blue eyes 
of a goat, he had the waggling whiskers of a 
goat. Perhaps it’s in memory of Dr. Angstrom 
that Ivy College has a goat for its mascot 
now. 

Dr. Angstrom was even more goatish than 
usual that day last summer when half a 
dozen top scientists in the field gathered to 



67 




see his preview experiment on mat- 
ter transmission of a live animal. 
He had been working 4 Jiard for 
weeks on the transmitter and keep- 
ing up classes at the same time, 
which did not improve his disposi- 
tion. Besides, he had a real goat for 
an experimental animal, and goats 
are notoriously hard on the nervous 
system. 

This particular animal, at the 
moment the scientists entered, was 
straining at his rope, trying to get a 
mouthful of a tablecloth which 
graced a nearby table full of jars 
and retorts. Failing this, the goat 
exhibited that typical lack of dis- 
crimination in matters edible and 
began to chew on his rope. 

I felt a little out of place among 
all these giant brains. My reason 
for being there was that I"had been 
serving, during my college career, 
as sort of a factotum and fetch-and- 
carry man for Dr. Angstrom, and I 
was to take notes for him. I had 
acquired considerable affection for 
The Old Goat. Maybe that’s one 
reason I hate to see his great scien- 
tific work kept under wraps because 
people still insist it’s dangerous. 

“I have proved to my own satis- 
faction that the matter transmitter 
works,” Dr. Angstrom told the as- 
sembled scientists. “I have made a 
number of transmissions of inani- 
mate matter. In theory, it should 
work just as well for animate ob- 
jects and I have invited you to be 
present at the first test of this 
theory. 

“I need not go into detail with 
you about the basic theory of mat- 
ter transmission. The transmitter 
itself picks up the atomic and elec- 



tronic ‘image’ of the object inside 
it, much as a television scanner 
picks up a scene, except that it is 
done in three dimensions instead of 
two. This is made possible by the 
four-dimensional element which is 
the heart of the apparatus and was 
made available to us through recent 
intra-atomic research. 

“The receiver picks up the image 
as a television receiver does, except 
again in three dimensions. The mat- 
ter is not duplicated because the 
transmitter strips down the object 
within it as it transmits. 

“Now the question that has been 
raised by some scientists about the 
transmission of animate objects is 
whether the ‘soul’ or ‘life force’ can 
be transmitted. I consider this ques- 
tion ridiculous, and will prove it so. 
It is my contention that such ‘life 
force’ is not a thing apart from the 
physical shell.” 

The matter transmitter was a 
large closed cylinder on one side 
of the room. The receiver was a 
similar cylinder on the other. Both 
were raised slightly from the floor. 

As sort of hors d’ oeuvre, Dr. Ang- 
strom transmitted a large chunk of 
lead across the room, then a glass 
jar. In each case, the object was 
placed in the transmitter and a 
moment later removed from the 
receiver across the room. There was 
no possible way for it to have been 
moved across the intervening space 
except by broadcast transmission. 

“As you see,” said Dr. Angstrom, 
“I have eliminated the necessity 
for a switch by building the switch 
into the door of the transmitter. As 
soon as the door is closed, transmis-

You know how a tune can dominate the mind. 



Imagine the effect of the perfect melody! 



BY ARTHUR C. CLARKE 




ff^HARLIE,” Harry Purvis began, quietly enough. 

VJ “That darn tune you’re whistling is driving me mad. 
I’ve heard it every time I’ve switched on the radio for the 
last week.” 

There was a sniff from John Christopher. 

“You ought to stay tuned to the Third Programme. Then 
you’d be safe.” 

“Some of us,” retorted Harry, “don’t care for an ex- 
clusive diet of Elizabethan madrigals. But don’t let’s quarrel 
about that , for heaven’s sake. Has it ever occurred to you 
that there’s something rather — fundamental — about hit 

tunes?” 

“What do you mean?” 
“Well, they come along out 
of nowhere, and then for weeks 
everybody’s humming them, 
just as Charlie did then. The 
good ones grab hold of you so 
thoroughly that you just can’t 
get them out of your head — 
they go round and round for 
days. And then, suddenly, 
they’ve vanished again.” 

“I know what you mean,” 
said Art Vincent. “There are 
some melodies that you can 
take or leave, but others that 
stick like treacle, whether you 
want them or not.” 

“Precisely. I got saddled that 
way for a whole week with the 
big theme from the finale of 
Sibelius Two — even went to 
sleep with it running round inside my head. Then there’s 
that “Third Man” piece — da di da di daa, di da, di daa . 
look what that did to everybody.” 

Harry had to pause for a moment until his audience had 
stopped zithering. When the last “Plonk!” had died away 
he continued: 

“Precisely! You all felt the same way. Now what is there 
about these tunes that has this effect? Some of them are 
great music — others just banal, but they’ve obviously got 
something in common.” 

“Go on,” said Charlie. “We’re waiting.” 

“I don’t know what the answer is,” replied Harry.

“And what’s more, I don’t want to. 
For I know a man who f~und out.” 

Automatically, someone handed 
him a beer, so that the tenor of his 
tale would not be disturbed. It al- 
ways annoyed a lot of people when 
he had to stop in mid-flight for a 
refill. 

“I don’t know why it is,” said 
Harry Purvis, “that most scientists 
are interested in music, but it’s an 
undeniable fact. I’ve known several 
large labs that had their own 
amateur symphony orchestras — 
some of them quite good, too. As 
far as the mathematicians are con- 
cerned, one can think of obvious 
reasons for this fondness: music, 
particularly classical music, has a 
form which is almost mathematical. 
And then, of course, there’s the un- 
derlying theory — harmonic rela- 
tions, wave analysis, frequency 
distribution, and so on. It’s a 
fascinating study in itself, and one 
that appeals strongly to the scien- 
tific mind. Moreover, it doesn’t — 
as some people might think — pre- 
clude a purely aesthetic apprecia- 
tion of music for its own sake. 

“However, I must confess that 
Gilbert Lister’s interest in music 
was purely cerebral. He was, pri- 
marily, a physiologist, specializing 
in the study of the brain. So when 
I said that his interest was cerebral, 
I meant it quite literally. Alexan- 
der’s Ragtime Band and the Choral 
Symphony were all the same to 
him. He wasn’t concerned with the 
sounds themselves, but only what 
happened when they got past the 
ears and started doing things to the 
brain. 

“In an audience as well edu- 



cated as this:” said Harry, with an 
emphasis that made it sound posi- 
tively insulting, “there will be no- 
one who’s unaware of the fact that 
much of the brain’s activity is elec- 
trical. There are, in fact, steady 
pulsing rhythms going on all the 
time, and they can be detected and 
analysed by modern instruments. 
This was Gilbert Lister’s territory. 
He could stick electrodes on your 
scalp and his amplifiers would draw 
your brain waves on yards of tape. 
Then he could examine them and 
tell you all sorts of interesting things 
about yourself. Ultimately, he 
claimed, it would be possible to 
identify anyone from their enceph- 
alogram — to use the correct term — 
more positively than by finger- 
prints. A man might get a surgeon 
to change his skin, but if we ever 
got to the stage when surgery could 
change your brain — well, you’d 
have turned into somebody else, 
anyway, so the system still wouldn’t 
have failed. 

“It was while he was studying 
the alpha, beta and other rhythms 
in the brain that Gilbert got in- 
terested in music. He was sure that 
there must be some connection be- 
tween musical and mental rhythms. 
He’d play music at various tempos 
to his subjects and see what effect 
it had on their normal brain fre- 
quencies. As you might expect, it 
had a lot, and the discoveries he 
made led Gilbert on into more 
philosophical fields. 

“I only had one good talk with 
him about his theories. It was not 
that he was at all secretive — I’ve 
never met a scientist who was, come 
to think of it — but he didn’t like to 



72 



ARTHUR C. CLARKE 




talk about his work until he knew 
where it was leading. However, 
what he told me was enough to 
prove that he’d opened up a very 
interesting line, and thereafter I 
made rather a point of cultivating 
him. My firm supplied some of his 
equipment, but I wasn’t averse to 
picking up a little profit on the 
side. It occurred to me that if 
Gilbert’s ideas worked out, he’d 
need a business manager before you 
could whistle the opening bar of 
the Fifth Symphony . 

“For what Gilbert was trying to 
do was to lay a scientific founda- 
tion for the theory of hit-tunes. Of 
course, he didn’t think of it that 
way: he regarded it as a pure re- 
search project, and didn’t look any 
further ahead than a paper in the 
Proceedings of the Physical Society . 
But I spotted its financial implica- 
tions at once. They were quite 
breath-taking. 

“Gilbert was sure that a great 
melody, or a hit tune, made its im- 
pression on the mind because in 
some way it fitted in with the fun- 
damental electrical rhythms going 
on in the brain. One analogy he 
used was “It’s like a Yale key 
going into a lock — the two patterns 
have got to fit before anything hap- 
pens.” 

“He tackled the problem from 
two angles. In the first place, he 
took hundreds of the really famous 
tunes in classical and popular music 
and analysed their structure — their 
morphology, as he put it. This was 
done automatically, in a big har- 
monic analyser that sorted out all 
the frequencies. Of course, there 
was a lot more to it than this, but 

ULTIMATE MELODY 



I’m sure you’ve got the basic idea. 

“At the same time, he tried to 
see how the resutling patterns of 
waves agreed with the natural elec- 
trical vibrations of the brain. Be- 
cause it was Gilbert’s theory — and 
this is where we get into rather 
deep philosophical waters — that all 
existing tunes were merely crude 
approximations to one fundamental 
melody. Musicians had been grop- 
ing for it down the centuries, but 
they didn’t know what they were 
doing, because they were ignorant 
of the relation between music and 
mind. Now that this had been un- 
ravelled, it should be possible to 
discover the Ultimate Melody.” 

“Huh!” said John Christopher. 
“It’s only a rehash of Plato’s theory 
of ideals. You know — all the ob- 
jects of our material world are 
merely crude copies of the ideal 
chair or table or what-have-you. So 
your friend was after the ideal 
melody. And did he find it?” 

“I’ll tell you,” continued Harry 
imperturbably. “It took Gilbert 
about a year to complete his analy- 
sis, and then he started on the syn- 
thesis. To put it crudely, he built a 
machine that would automatically 
construct patterns of sound accord- 
ing to the laws that he’d uncovered. 
He had banks of oscillators and 
mixers — in fact, he modified an or- 
dinary electronic organ for this part 
of the apparatus — which were con- 
trolled by his composing machine. 
In the rather childish way that 
scientists like to name their off- 
spring, Gilbert had called this de- 
vice Ludwig. 

“Maybe it helps to understand 
how Ludwig operated if you think 

73 




of him as a kind of kaleidoscope, 
working with sound rather than 
light. But he was a kaleidoscope set 
to obey certain laws, and those laws 
— so Gilbert believed — were based 
on the fundamental structure of the 
human mind. If he could get the 
adjustments correct, Ludwig would 
be bound, sooner or later, to arrive 
at the Ultimate Melody as he 
searched through all the possible 
patterns of music. 

“I had one opportunity of hear- 
ing Ludwig at work, and it was un- 
canny. The equipment was the 
usual nondescript mess of elec- 
tronics which one meets in any lab : 
it might have been a mock-up of a 
new computer, a radar gun-sight, a 
traffic control system, or a ham 
radio. It was very hard to believe 
that, if it worked, it would put ev- 
ery composer in the world out of 
business. Or would it? Perhaps not: 
Ludwig might be able to deliver the 
raw material, but surely it would 
still have to be orchestrated. 

‘‘Then the sound started to come 
from the speaker. At first it seemed 
to me that I was listening to the 
five-finger exercises of an accurate 
but completely uninspired pupil. 
Most of the themes were quite 
banal : the machine would play 
one, then ring the changes on it 
bar after bar until it had exhausted 
all the possibilities before going on 
to the next. Occasionally a quite 
striking phrase would come up, but 
on the whole I was not at all im- 
pressed. 

“However, Gilbert explained that 
this was only a trial run and that 
the main circuits had not yet been 

74 



set up. When they were, Ludwig 
would be far more selective : at the 
moment, he was playing everything 
that came along — he had no sense 
of discrimination. When he had ac- 
quired that, then the possibilities 
were limitless. 

“That was the last time I ever 
saw Gilbert Lister. I had arranged 
to meet him at the lab about a week 
later, when he expected to have 
made substantial progress. As it 
happened, I was about an hour late 
for my appointment. And that was 
very lucky for me . 

“When I got there, they had just 
taken Gilbert away. His lab assist- 
ant, an old man who’d been with 
him for years, was sitting distraught 
and disconsolate among the tangled 
wiring of Ludwig. It took me a long 
time to discover what had hap- 
pened, and longer still to work out 
the explanation. 

“There was no doubt of one 
thing. Ludwig had finally worked. 
The assistant had gone off to lunch 
while Gilbert was making the final 
adjustments, and when he came 
back an hour later the laboratory 
was pulsing with one long and very 
complex melodic phrase. Either the 
machine had stopped automatically 
at that point, or Gilbert had 
switched it over to REPEAT. At 
any rate, he had been listening, for 
several hundred times at least, to 
that same melody. When his assist- 
ant found him, he seemed to be in a 
trance. His eyes were open yet un- 
seeing, his limbs rigid. Even when 
Ludwig was switched off, it made 
no difference. Gilbert was beyond 
help. 

“What had happened? Well, I 
ARTHUR C. CLARKE 




suppose we should have thought of 
it, but it’s so easy to be wise after 
the event. It’s just as I said at the 
beginning. If a composer, working 
merely by rule of thumb, can pro- 
duce a melody which can dominate 
your mind for days on end, imagine 
the effect of the Ultimate Melody 
for which Gilbert was searching! 
Supposing it existed — and I’m not 
admitting that it does — it would 
form an endless ring in the memory 
circuits of the mind. It would go 
round and round forever, obliterat- 
ing all other thoughts. All the cloy- 
ing melodies of the past would be 
mere ephemerae compared to it. 

“They’ve tried shock therapy — 
everything. But it’s no good; the 
pattern has been set, and it can’t be 
broken. He’s lost all consciousness 
of the outer world, and has to be 
fed intravenously. He never moves 
or reacts to external stimuli, but 
sometimes, they tell me, he twitches 
in a peculiar way as if he is beating 
time . 

“I’m afraid there’s no hope for 
him. Yet I’m not sure if his fate is 
a horrible one, or whether he 
should be envied. Perhaps, in a 
sense, he’s found the ultimate real- 
ity that philosophers like Plato are 
always talking about. I really don’t 
know. And sometimes I find myself 
wondering just what that infernal 
melody was like, and almost wish- 
ing that I’d been able to hear it 
perhaps once. But there’ll never be 
a chance now, of course.” 

“I was waiting for this,” said 
Charles Willis nastily. “I suppose 
the apparatus blew up, or some- 
thing, so that as usual there’s no 



way of checking your story.” 

Harry gave him his best more-in- 
sorrow-than-in-anger look. 

“What happened next was one of 
those completely maddening things 
for which I shall never stop blam- 
ing myself. You see, I’d been too 
interested in Gilbert’s experiment to 
look after my firm’s business in the 
way that I should. I’m afraid he’d 
fallen badly behind with his pay- 
ments, and when the Accounts De- 
partment discovered what had hap- 
pened to him they acted quickly. I 
was only off for a couple of days on 
another job, and when I got back, 
do you know what had happened? 
They’d pushed through a court or- 
der, and had seized all their prop- 
erty. Of course that had meant dis- 
mantling Ludwig: when I saw him 
next he was just a pile of useless 
junk. It made me weep.” 

“I’m sure of it,” said Eric Maine. 
“But you’ve forgotten Loose End 
Number Two. What about Gilbert’s 
assistant ? He went into the lab 
while the gadget was going full 
blast. Why didn’t it get him, too?” 
H. Purvis, Esquire, paused to 
drain the last drops from his glass 
and to hand it across to Drew. 

“Really!” he said. “Is this a 
cross-examination? I didn’t men- 
tion the point because it was rather 
trivial. You see, Gilbert’s assistant 
was a first-rate lab technician, but 
he’d never been able to help much 
with the adjustments to Ludwig. 
For he was one of those people who 
are completely tone-deaf. To him, 
the Ultimate Melody meant no 
more than a couple of cats on a 
garden wall.” • • •

T HE MINISTER of Peace asked the United States 
President if he had heard from the Secretary of State. 
“Yes/’ the President said. “I heard from Mr. Thompson 
only a few minutes ago.” 

“How’s their final conference coming, Mr. President?” 
“Inevitably. Operation Push Button within the hour.” 
The Minister of Peace blinked out the window at 
Washington, D.G. “So they’re going to blow up the 
world?” 

“Inevitably.” 

“Shall we watch it?” asked the Minister of Peace. 
The President nodded, spoke to master control through 
the intercom box on his desk, and switched on the TV 
screen. They had a special pipe-line into the United Na- 
tions Cellar. They sat back, had martinis, and watched 
the interior of the Cellar come to life on the screen. 

Three thousand miles from New Washington, under 
a natural camouflage of tundra and wintry hills, the 
U.N. Cellar was thought by its occupants to be thorough- 
ly resistant to any offensive weapons. It was three miles 
underground, protected by lead, concrete and steel. Its 
location was known only to the UN Security Division

that was supposed to be strictly 
neutral in international affairs, or 
so the Cellar occupants assumed. 
The engineers and workmen who 
had planned and constructed the 
Cellar were supposed to have been 
brainwashed and therefore had no 
memory of the great project. An oc- 
casional caribou drifted over the 
Cellar with the North Wind, and 
wolves that always follow the cari- 
bou. 

In his suite, Chandler Thomp- 
son, Secretary of State, prepared 
himself for the global diplomacy 
game’s final hand in which it is 
never so important what hand you 
play, as the way you play it. After 
years of negotiation, full agreement 
on Operation Push Button had 
been attained, and Thompson took 
some pride in having played a lead- 
ing role in the ingenious idea. 

Morten, his valet, finished shav- 
ing Thompson’s pale face, helped 
him dress in striped trousers, cut- 
away, and white gardenia. 

“Thank you, Morten,” said the 
Secretary of State. 

“You seem calm enough, sir. 
Frankly, I’m ill at ease.” 

“You may leave the Cellar if you 
wish,” Thompson said, skimming 
through his notes. “You’ve served 
graciously. I appreciate it. But it 
is your privilege to return to your 
family outside now. I might remind 
you that your chance of survival if 
you remain here is practically 100 
percent.” 

“It isn’t that, sir. It just seems 
incredible that so many must die.” 
He felt of his wallet, the pictures 
of his family in it. 

“It’s hardly a matter of princi- 



ple,” Thompson said. “Nor a ques- 
tion of ideology. It’s simply a ques- 
tion of firmness and realistic prac- 
ticality, and getting the job done 
once and for all. That has been my 
stand from the beginning and na- 
turally it cannot be changed.” 

“But billions of people dying — ” 

“Death before dishonor, Mor- 
ten.” 

“Yes, sir.” Morten knew that in 
every suite in the Cellar every 
diplomat was saying practically the 
same thing. Thompson looked up 
from his neat notes. “People, 
Morten, have been properly pre- 
pared for violent death. Indeed 
there has been a feeling of security 
in numbers. The Ministry of Edu- 
cation working with the War De- 
partment has done such a splendid 
job. Now every child has grown up 
fully prepared to die in the holo- 
caust. And every individual still a 
child regards violent death as 
casually as a game of marbles. The 
required attitude has been thor- 
oughly conditioned in the populace. 
The idea was to make violence, 
savagery, and sudden death, an 
every day affair. And we have done 
it. Sad, but a necessary task.” 

Morten said nothing. Thompson 
looked at the neon map corusca- 
ting on the wall. “Our country is 
not unique in this, Morten. Anni- 
hilation will come as a shock only 
to the misinformed anywhere in the 
world.” 

Morten sat down. He remem- 
bered how his kids used to come 
home from school laughingly play- 
ing war games, manipulating toy 
atomic cannons and the like. They 
received additional marks in school 



78 



BRYCE WALTON 




for being good and cooperative 
during atomic bomb drills and 
preparations for thermonuclear 
disasters. They had been so proud 
of their dogtags that came with 
boxes of cereal. In the evenings out 
back they used to have bury-the- 
dead games. 

Thompson was saying, “Remem- 
ber juvenile delinquency? It was 
necessary. Millions had to be con- 
ditioned psychologically for Opera- 
tion Killer. An insensitive, fatal- 
istic attitude had to be engendered. 
For their own good.” 

Morten flicked a speck of lint 
from Thompson’s stooped shoulder. 

“Yes, sir,” he said. “Maybe it 
will be humane, in the long run.” 

“One must face the hard, ma- 
terialistic facts,” Thompson said. 
“Oh, that reminds me.” He went to 
his private switchboard and got a 
secret outside line to the Office of 
Civilian Defense. “Hello, Donnel- 
son. Yes, I’m fine. I haven’t talked 
with you for some time now, and I 
was wondering about that sugges- 
tion of mine. Yes, the household 
pets thing. That’s right, particular- 
ly dogs. They’re big morale factors 
in the lives of children and there 
may be some survivors. Well, then, 
issue another bulletin on that im- 
mediately. Things are reaching a 
head here in the Cellar. Yes, dogs 
should be lashed firmly to heavy 
pieces of furniture, away from win- 
dows. Put water where they can 
reach it. Hysteria under the bomb- 
ing attacks can be avoided by giv- 
ing sodium bromide tablets to the 
dogs. That’s right. Survivors will 
need pets. Morale . .” 

After Thompson was through 

WAR GAME 



talking to Donnelson, Morten said. 
“You know, sir, the end will be a 
relief to some people. They’ve been 
blitzed by a non-stop barrage of 
fear bombs so long, I think they’ll 
be glad to get it over with.” 

“Very perceptive, Morten. That 
has been one of Psychological War- 
fare’s primary aims in preparation.” 
Thompson got another outside line. 
Dawson, Civilian Defense. As he 
waited for Dawson to come in, he 
said to Morten. “Get the dueling 
pistols out of the cabinet, please.” 
Morten nodded. 

“Hello, Dawson. Fine, fine, 
things coming to a head here. How 
much distribution did you manage 
on the shrouds? Eighty percent? 
Excellent. I haven’t heard from 
Harry on the details for quite a 
while. Wanted to check personally. 
As you say, I’ve never really lost 
my touch with the grass-roots. My 
feeling from the start was that mil- 
lions of wooden coffins would be 
out of the question. The olive drab 
plastic sheets seemed to be the only 
practical recourse from the start. 
The psychological importance of 
getting bodies out of sight as rapid- 
ly as possible cannot be overempha- 
sized. Oh, Dawson, one moment 
. yes, I know about the public 
parks, playgrounds and vacant 
tracts in the suburbs. But what 
about New York City? The only 
way is to send the bodies up the 
Hudson River using piers as 
morgues. The problem of where to 
put so many bodies, particularly 
when they will all appear for dis- 
posal at the same time, is a consid- 
erable one. Allowing for three-by- 
six grave-sites, with three feet for 



79 




aisles, the whole problem of ade-, 
quate disposal acreage is primary.” 
Thompson switched off the connec- 
tion. 

Thompson moved his fingers 
over the .38 caliber dueling pistols 
in the velvet-lined case. His eyes 
mellowed with nostalgia. “Gift 
from the old Secretary of War. My 
boy, Don, learned to shoot with this 
one when he was only six years old. 
If he had lived to be an adult, he 
would have been a tough fighter. 
But hti was killed by a rival delin- 
quent gang when he was twelve. 
He only got there a little sooner. He 
had just finished reading Niebuhr, 
so he knew the tragic irony of his- 
tory.” 

Thompson balanced one of the 
pistols in his hand. He looked at his 
watch. “It’s time,” he said reli- 
giously. 

As Thompson entered the Hall of 
Ministers, the representatives of 
five balance of power nations arose 
at once in deference to the sixth. 
Morten sat unobtrusively in a far 
corner, holding the case of dueling 
pistols on his knees. 

Thompson sat down. The min- 
utes of the last conference were 
read by a mechanical secretary. A 
summation of their final agreement 
on Operation Push Button was 
briefly reviewed by the automatic 
translating secretary. No changes 
were suggested. 

The surface of the huge confer- 
ence table was somewhat like a gi- 
gantic topographical map of the 
world. It covered perhaps a thou- 
sand square feet and had been con- 
structed by brain-washed artisans 
and engineers and scientists in per- 



fect electronic detail. It was so real- 
istic that it radiated a sort of sen- 
tience, seeming almost to breathe 
in astonishing precision with the 
respiration of important strategical- 
ly located cities, ports, commynica- 
tion and manufacturing centers. 
Before each Minister was a"console 
containing several buttons. 

Each Minister arose, made a 
speech concerning the sovereign 
rights of the particular nation or 
bloc of nations he represented. In 
each case, the speeches seemed the 
same to Morten. He knew that if 
merely the name of the country or 
bloc in each speech was changed, 
the rest would be the same, and 
sound something like: 

“Gentlemen, a free such-and- 
such people can no longer tolerate 
a militant rearming so-and-so. Ev- 
ery other possibility has been dis- 
cussed and rejected. I must say now 
that at this moment a state of war 
must of necessity exist between 
such-and-such and so-and-so.” 

Morten had been hearing vari- 
ations of it for years. He knew it all 
by heart. As each Minister made 
this implacable statement, he sat 
down, and without further cere- 
mony, pushed a button or buttons 
on his private console. On the topo- 
graphical map, as a button was 
pushed, some important section of 
the map, an area, a city, a port, 
some significant transportation, 
communication, or manufacturing 
industrial center, would shoot out 
realistic sparks, smoke, and then 
crumble into lifeless debris. 

Morten tried to control the 
flinching and twitching of his mus- 
cles. An intricate network of elec- 



80 



BRYCE WALTON 




tronic relays connected with ther- 
monuclear bombs went out all over 
the world, and were hooked in to 
the map on the conference table. 
Millions of people were just blown 
up somewhere, Morten thought. 

Another Minister finished his 
speech, sat down, pressed buttons. 
More smoke and flashes shot up. 
Millions of others out there some- 
where have just been annihilated, 
Morten thought. It doesn’t seem 
possible, he thought then. It’s not 
possible. It’s some kind of final 
madness. But it’s happening. 

It had been decided that this was 
the simple direct way, avoiding 
long, time-wasting programs of 
mobilization and warfare. If the 
conclusion was foregone, had been 
the question, then why not go di- 
rectly to it by the shortest and most 
efficient route? And the answer was 
as inevitable as the question. 

More Ministers stood up, made 
their final declarations, and pushed 
buttons. Little puffballs and clouds 
of smoke drifted over the confer- 
ence table, obscuring distinctive 
facial outlines and turning the min- 
isters into shadow shapes as Mor- 
ten watched. 

Only two of the Ministers had 
not yet pressed their buttons. Only 
two sectors of the world remain 
alive, Morten thought. He coughed 
as acrid smoke swirled about the 
room. He felt a kind of blessed 
numbed paralysis. He could almost 
feel the whole world turning into a 
radioactive hell all around him, 
mushrooms of, gigantic size sprout- 
ing fast and furiously in the last 
big aftermath of rain. Yet he could 
scarcely imagine how it really was

now, outside the Cellar. He thought 
vaguely about the dogs, wondering 
how many of them had avoided 
hysteria by having been tied to 
heavy pieces of furniture and given 
sodium bromide tablets. The kids 
who survived would need pets. 

Morten sat there, trying to see 
through the thickening smoke. He 
tried to feel grateful for having 
been in the Cellar. But in a few 
more seconds America might also 
be destroyed. What then? And 
what if only America remained — 
would that be any better? 

He had resisted such speculation, 
but how could he resist it any 
longer? The Ministers had their 
wives, families, lovers in the Cel- 
lar, and supplies enough to last in- 
definitely. But Morten’s family was 
outside. In a few seconds they 
might be dead. After that nothing. 
Nothing at all. 

He heard Thompson say in a 
calm voice. “Morten, the pistols.” 

He also heard the other Minis- 
ter say in Russian that he wanted 
his pistol. Morten had to respect 
the secret agreement that Thomp- 
son and the Russian Minister had 
made yesterday. After the other 
Ministers pushed their buttons, 
Thompson and the Russian would 
fight a duel then the survivor of the 
duel would push his button. 

“Someone should win,” Thomp- 
son and the Russian had agreed. 
“This way, one will be the absolute 
victor.” 

If the other Ministers knew what 
this secret agreement was they 
either did not care, or did not care 
enough now. They got up from the

Barton was unique — an absolutely self-sufficient human being. 
The biggest problem he had in space was holding on to his san- 
ity. And he solved it by altering time itself to suit his needs . 



THE FLOATER 



A S A WATCHMAN in a man-made kind 
of observational meteor floating millions 
of miles from nowhere out among the planets, 
Barton had two main duties. To keep his sanity 
and to keep the watch. The second was simple. 
The gadgets all took care of themselves. All 
Barton did was send in a report in case an 
alarm went off indicating something was wrong 
with some gadget or other. 

Staying sane was supposed to be a watcher’s 
big problem. Barton couldn’t figure out why 
they were so concerned, especially the neuro- 
psychologist or whatever he was, Von Ulrich, 
who was always coming around in his clinical 
space boat, studying Barton, asking him ques- 
tions, giving him all kinds of tests.

Once something glinted like a mote in sun- 
light past the observation port and Von Ulrich 
said. “That’s Collins out there. Collins was 
here only a week and he put on a pressure suit 
and jumped into space. He’s still rotating 
round and round out there.” 

“Poor devil,” Barton said. 

“Most of them don’t even last a week out 
here, Barton. Six months is the maximum. 

You’ve been here almost a year and you’re 
liable to start cracking any minute. I don’t like 
the way things look.” 



83 



“I feel fine, sir.” 

Several months later, Von Ulrich 
dropped by again. “How are things 
going, Barton?” 

“Great, sir. Just swell.” 

“You feel comfortable, no anx- 
iety?” 

“I feel fine.” 

“You’ve done a fine job, Barton 
— so far.” 

“Thank you, sir.” 

“You manage to keep occupied?” 
“I just take it easy, sir.” 

“I see.” 

A few months later, Von Ulrich 
was back, watching Barton mould- 
ing something out of clay, a sort 
of human shape without a face. 
There were other self-amusement 
gimmicks, wood-working, soap- 
carving, movies and the like, but 
Barton preferred moulding things 
haphazardly out of clay, and some- 
times reading one of the books he 
wasn’t supposed to have brought 
along because books were no longer 
popular. 

“What were you thinking about 
when you moulded this thing?” 
Von Ulrich asked. 

“Nothing much, sir.” 

“You must have been thinking 
of something?” 

“I guess I was thinking of a man 
sleeping beside a river in green 
grass with nobody for miles around. 
Something like that.” 

“You weren’t by any chance 
thinking about a dead man?” 

“I don’t like death much.” 

Later on sometime, Von Ulrich 
dropped around again on his thera- 
peutic tour of basketballs, and Mar- 
tian bases, and other bases even 

84 



more remote. Barton wondered how 
anyone could find the basketball 
drifting in all that blackness. Just 
a little ragged spheroid like a piece 
of dead slag, something like a cork 
bobbing in a black ocean too big 
even to bother thinking about. 
If no one ever found the basket- 
ball Barton would have been hap- 
pier, because the basketball was 
self-sustaining and could go on and 
on for years without supplies or any 
human contact. 

“Getting a little lonely maybe?” 
Von Ulrich asked. 

“No sir.” 

“Don’t miss having people 
around. Your wife, your son?” 

Barton wanted to laugh. 

“Well, I’ll be back to see you, 
Barton. I may be gone a year this 
time.” 

“Happy New Year,” Barton said. 

But it didn’t seem like a year 
when Von Ulrich came back in his 
sleek little space-hopping clinic. It 
didn’t seem like much of anything. 

“You don’t find the absence of 
women irritating, Barton?” 

“I can take them or leave them, 
sir. 

“Not here. There simply aren’t 
any at all.” 

“I like something, but then if it 
isn’t there, I don’t miss it.” 

“All right, Barton,” Von Ulrich 
would say after giving Barton more 
brain-wave tests, word-association 
tests and making him look at ink- 
blots until his eyes turned red. “See 
you in a few months.” 

“See you, sir,” Barton said. 

And sure enough, as though he 
had never really been away, Von 
Ulrich would show up again, with 

KENNETH O'HARA 




his testing devices, his cages of mice 
and guinea pigs, and his intense 
searching eyes. He had a folder of 
pictures and after ink-blot tests, he 
had Barton look at the pictures, 
like the one of a man in deep shad- 
ow standing over a sleeping kid. 

“What do you see there, Bar- 
ton? ” 

“A guy standing over a kid.” 
“What’s he doing there?” 

“I haven’t any idea.” 

“Is the child sleeping?” 

“Maybe it’s just pretending.” 
“Pretending what?” 

“Or maybe it’s dead.” 

Von Ulrich’s thin face frowned 
intensely. “Is the child pretending 
to be asleep, or is it dead?” 

“Maybe it isn’t a real kid. Maybe 
it’s a dummy.” 

Von Ulrich’s face reddened. 
“What’s the man thinking?” 

“How should I know, sir.” 

“You don’t care?” 

“No, why should I give a damn 
what he’s thinking?” 

“You tell me. Why shouldn’t 
you?” 

“Because it’s none of my busi- 
ness.” 

Then there was another time, 
during some visit or other, when 
Von Ulrich pulled another word 
asssociation test. 

“Love.” 

“It makes the world go round.” 
“Blackness.” 

“Sleep.” 

“Alone.” 

“Quiet.” 

It went on for hours. Von Ulrich 
always seemed to be angrier be- 
cause Barton didn’t crack up, or 

THE FLOATER 



because he insisted on turning in a 
perfect service record in the basket- 
ball. 

“Barton, for God’s sake, don’t 
you realize how important this 
watch is? This valuable information 
gathered by these recorders. Think 
what it would mean if that data fell 
into the hands of the Asians! What 
if you missed an alarm, or fouled 
up in some way, and one of these 
recorders destroyed all the data?” 
“Haven’t I been alert all the 
time, sir?” 

“Yes! But you’ve been out here 
now for three years! Three years. 
No one can possibly stand it longer 
than six months. And the fact that 
you’ve been here for three years 
only means some absolutely cata- 
strophic crack-up is being pro- 
longed, built up inside.” 

“I don’t feel a bit different, sir.” 
“There are subtle ways of crack- 
ing up.” 

“You want me to have some sort 
of symptom or something?” 

“Don’t be ridiculous.” 



I T MUST have been at least an- 
other year before Von Ulrich 
came back to Barton’s basketball, 
triumphantly equipped with new 
devices, and waving a spacegram 
in Barton’s sleepy face. Barton read 
it, shrugged, and let it drift to the 
floor. Von Ulrich tried to control a 
look almost of fear. 

“As soon as the minimum time 
allowed, she married again,” Von 
Ulrich said. “And you pretend it 
means nothing?” 

“She never did mean much of 
anything, sir. I mean, she was an 



85 




interfering kind of woman. She 
wouldn’t let a man live.” 

“All right, Barton. What about 
this? She was committing adulter- 
ous acts with this fellow, this Major 
General Woods. She was having an 
affair with him for two years be- 
fore you volunteered for duty in 
the basketball.” 

“I figured she was playing 
around.” 

“You what?” 

“It figured.” 

“You still pretend it meant noth- 
ing, that it means nothing now?” 

“I don’t know what it means. 
What’s it got to do with me now? 
It was all right, I guess. I could 
have gone on with it. But this is 
better.” 

He dimly remembered Jean 
bitching all the time of an evening 
because Barton kept forgetting to 
take his officer’s exam, and how 
she had to skimp along on an 
NCO’s lousy salary, and so on and 
so forth. Very much the nagging 
kind. She wouldn’t let him read 
either. He would tell her he was 
just sort of stupid, and had always 
been a drifter anyway, and just sort 
of fell into marriage and that he 
never had had any ambition partic- 
ularly, and anyway big brass got 
ulcers and heart conditions. And 
then she would drag little Joey, the 
big-headed little brat into it, and 
talk about how little Joey didn’t 
have the right kind of idealized 
image to assure him a respectable 
future, and little Joey would stand 
there and nod his oversized head. 

“What about little Joey’s fu- 
ture?” Jean would say. “You want 
him to be just another stupid 

86 



NCO? And what about his teeth? 
He’s got to have his teeth straight- 
ened. They tease him at school, call 
him The Squirrel.” 

“Yeah, Dad. You want me to be 
personable and saleable and high 
on the success potential scale? What 
about my teeth protruding?” 

And when Barton went into the 
bathroom and came back out, Jean 
was throwing all those books he’d 
had such a hard time finding into 
the incinerator. Barton volunteered 
the next day for basketball duty. 

It didn’t even seem long ago to 
Barton. It was oddly like a dream 
that might have been in the past, or 
the future, or never at all. 

Von Ulrich grabbed up the 
spacegram and walked stiffly erect 
out of the basketball. 

At some time in the future, Von 
Ulrich showed up again with even 
more complicated tests and ques- 
tions. Barton wasn’t sure, but it 
seemed longer than usual that Von 
Ulrich was away these days. Time 
didn’t mean much. It didn’t have 
any particular use to Barton now. 

“Yes, yes, you have a perfect 
service record, Barton. Never have 
missed turning in an alarm with 
alacrity. And we’re so damned short 
of men capable of taking this kind 
of duty that I can’t pull you out of 
here until you make an error — or 
crack up. Just the same you’re not 
fooling me much longer, and you 
won’t be able to fool yourself 
either.” 

Sometime later there was the 
business about Barton’s mother. 
Von Ulrich had files on Barton go- 
ing clear back to pre-natal, and 
maybe even before that. 

KENNETH O'HARA 




“All right, Barton, you were an 
only child, and you lived with your 
mother for 10 years after your 
father died. Then you married. 
What about the fact that Jean was 
a replacement for your mother?” 
“If she was, it never seemed that 
way to me.” 

“You expected your wife to take 
care of you the way your mother 
did. And not demand anything of 
you. You expected to escape all re- 
sponsibility and — Barton, do you 
consider this basketball to be your 
mother?” 

“What’s that, sir?” 

“Deafness can be psychosomatic 
too, don’t forget that. I said — but 
you heard me, answer me.” 

“Doctor Von Ulrich, maybe I’m 
not normal, but — ” 

“Then you admit the regression. 
That this basketball floating in 
space is a substitute for your moth- 
er’s womb. You admit it!” 

“Why, sir, I didn’t—” 

“But you know it’s true don’t 
you?” 

“I didn’t say anything about it. 
You said it.” 

“I said it because it’s a summa- 
tion of years of careful diagnosis. 
Look at the etiology. A man who 
never matured, never was able to 
accept responsibility as a mature 
adult. Always just drifting along, 
into one job, out of it, into another 
job, out of that, never establishing 
roots anywhere, always floating 
about. Unable to accept any re- 
sponsibility for your marriage, 
wanting to escape it. Never able to 
get close, get involved with others, 
only wanting to receive, never give. 
What does it add up to? A fix, a 

THE FLOATER 



freeze in the pre-natal stage where 
you were floating free and com- 
pletely irresponsible in your moth- 
er’s amniotic fluid. That’s why 
you’re here in the basketball.” 

Von Ulrich’s intense eyes seemed 
to reach out like arms to enfold 
Barton, then recoiled as Barton 
shrugged and said : “So, it’s like my 
Ma’s womb. What difference does 
it make what you call it as long as 
I’m happy in it and do my job?” 
Von Ulrich’s lips moved sound- 
lessly and then he pointed a finger 
into Barton’s nose. “It makes a 
helluva lot of difference what you 
call it. You may be doing an effi- 
cient job here, but for the wrong 
reasons. I wish I could recommend, 
on the basis of my diagnosis, that 
you agree to a month’s checkup in 
the Martian Clinic but — ” 

Barton interrupted. “I’m glad 
you can’t. I wouldn’t like that as 
much as this. Maybe your reports 
won’t cut much ice as long as I 
keep up the perfect service record.” 
Von Ulrich’s jaws were ridged. 
“Damn the military system! Damn 
a system that says a man has to stay 
up here till he’s dead or crazy or 
makes a mistake!” 

“But Doc, I like it. I’m happier 
here, I think. Maybe I wasn’t nor- 
mal on Earth. Maybe I’m not nor- 
mal here, or maybe being abnormal 
on Earth makes me normal here. 
I’m happy and I do my work.” 
Von Ulrich backed away a few 
steps, then turned and ran out and 
slammed the sliding panel. He 
didn’t say goodbye to Barton this 
time, or that he would be back. But 
Barton took no hope from Von 
Ulrich’s lack of ceremony. 



87 




Von Ulrich did come back, sev- 
eral times. Barton was sleeping a 
great deal now. He didn’t putter 
with the gimmicks much, not even 
the clay, and he’d about read the 
books out. He slept a lot and yet 
there was a funny heavy feeling as 
though he never did quite sleep or 
never quite woke up either. But it 
was a good feeling because when a 
man was too sound asleep he didn’t 
enjoy it because he didn’t know 
anything about it. This was sort of 
in-between, and Barton loved it. 
Sometimes he would blink his eyes 
and see Von Ulrich standing there, 
probably with some new testing de- 
vice, or with a notebook open, or 
with a helmet with wires to attach 
to Barton’s skull to record some- 
thing. 

Another time he thought some 
stranger was there and then he 
realized that Von Ulrich’s face was 
sagging and wrinkled and that his 
hair was thinner and gray. 

“Why not have groups of watch- 
ers if you’re so worried about one 
being alone?” 

“We tried that, it was worse, 
Barton. They killed one another.” 
“Well, sir, my being alone is a 
good thing then, in that respect.” 
“Have you ever thought that you 
would kill yourself?” 

“Why no, sir. Why should I?” 
“Because you hate yourself. In a 
society, people can externalize their 
self-hate. They can hate society, 
other people. You can only turn 
your hate inward, on yourself.” 
“But I don’t hate anything, sir.” 
“You do!” 

“But, sir, I don’t.” 

“Barton, I said you hate yourself. 

88 



It’s in all the charts, everything. We 
all hate ourselves to some extent, 
why should you be different from 
everybody else?” 

“Why not, sir?” 

Von Ulrich pressed his hand over 
his eyes, and walked out. 



I T WAS like a dream with a shad- 
ow drifting in and out and in 
again, and it was Von Ulrich, look- 
ing so much older this time. “It’s 
been almost fifteen years, Barton. 
Fifteen years.” 

“So? Fifteen years earth time. 
What does that mean here to me, 
sir?” Barton smiled, closed his eyes. 
“What does time matter in your 
mother’s womb?” 

“You’ve developed a definite 
measurable syndrome, Barton. Ex- 
cessive lethargy and a sleeping com- 
pulsion. Eventually it will destroy 
your efficiency as a watcher if it 
hasn’t already.” 

Von Ulrich set off an alarm and 
in less than four seconds Barton 
was over there sending a report out 
to the authorities, a report Von Ul- 
rich immediately canceled as being 
false. 

Von Ulrich seemed to dissolve 
in a haze of fading light. 

“Is that you, Von Ulrich, sir?” 
' “I’m afraid so, Barton. Back 
again.” 

Von Ulrich sat down in the con- 
tour chair and filled a pipe. 

“Remember, Barton when you 
took your test for basketball duty? 
The dead man’s float?” 

“I sort of remember it, sir. It was 
fun.” 

Von Ulrich flinched. “Fun? I’ve 
KENNETH O'HARA 




gone over that report on your test. 
Barton. It doesn’t make sense. 
What the hell are you anyway? A 
damned freak, a mutation, an alien 
in disguise?” 

The dead man’s float had been 
pleasant for Barton, that was all he 
could remember about it. They had 
taken off all Barton’s clothes so that 
nothing touched Barton’s body but 
a blacked-out head-mask through 
which to get air. He had been put 
in a tank of water at body tempera- 
ture upside down and floated there. 
There was no sensation. It had been 
one of the happiest times of his life. 
Like floating on air. Hearing noth- 
ing, seeing nothing, feeling nothing 
except his own existence. Not even 
able to tell which was right side up, 
or right side down, cross-wise or 
whatnot. He had been told to 
keep still, but nobody had needed 
to tell him to do that. 

“The first two or three hours of 
that dead man’s float is a good test 
for basketball duty, Barton. It’s a 
kind of final isolation of the human 
organism. Normal human beings 
can take a couple of hours of it 
usually. They like it. Every human 
being to some extent likes to return 
to the womb. But after a couple of 
hours most human beings start go- 
ing to pieces, short-circuiting. The 
reason is the deprivation of any 
outside stimuli. Something has to 
feed in through some source — some 
reception source — the skin, ears, 
nose, the eyes. These things feeding 
in, they orient a person, tells him 
when he’s thinking, feeling, gives 
him stimuli for additional thinking. 
With all these turned off, a person 
is simply left with a closed circuit. 

THE FLOATER 



This begins to go round and round 
and distorts and magnifies and rup- 
tures the whole thinking process. 
The floater becomes anxious, then 
very anxious, then he begins having 
hallucinations, finally becomes com- 
pletely disoriented. All this happens 
to a normal human being inside, at 
the most, three or four hours. No 
human being should be able to re- 
main sane after four hours of the 
dead man’s float. Barton. But re- 
member how long you lay there in 
that tank?” 

“I didn’t care how long it was.” 

“Three days,” Von Ulrich said. 
“The neurophysiologist in charge 
there kept checking your reaction 
and finally he had to take you out 
of the tank, not because you were 
short-circuiting, but because he was. 
The impression was that you would 
have been delighted with the pros- 
pect of doing the dead man’s float 
forever.” 

“I don’t remember it being any 
special time. It was like a dream, 
sir, you know.” 

“I don’t know, but I’m trying to 
find out.” Von Ulrich sighed and 
looked through the spaceport at 
blackness. “Out here I sometimes 
find myself wondering what nor- 
malcy really is. Things sometimes 
veer toward the dangerously rel- 
ativistic.” He sat there in the pure 
one hundred percent silence of the 
basketball while it accumulated. 
“There’s one thing we’ve always in- 
sisted no human being could toler- 
ate, Barton. Isolation. Sullivan said 
that a single minute of complete 
isolation would kill a human being. 
And you’ve been in a dead man’s 
float for almost twenty-two years.” 

89 




“Twenty-two years, sir?” 
“Doesn’t mean a thing to you 
does it?” 

“Well, sir, it doesn’t seem to have 
had any time in it. I was just here.” 

There was another time, like all 
the other times, except that Von 
Ulrich seemed much older, his hair 
thinner and now all of it gray. 
There seemed to be something tired 
about him, except for the bright- 
ness coming from behind his in- 
tense questioning eyes. 

Suddenly he asked, “Barton, 
what time is it?” 

Barton glanced at the chrono. 
“Quarter of four, sir.” 

“Keep looking.” 

After a while Barton said, “Still 
quarter of four.” 

“That chrono hasn’t been work- 
ing for three years. I stopped it 
three years ago. You haven’t even 
noticed it, have you?” 

“I guess not, sir.” 

“Take a long look out there, 
Barton. Nothing to see but black- 
ness. No feeling of distance. Imag- 
ine your mind going out there, ex- 
ploring, trying to fit in somewhere. 
You look out there, you project 
your thoughts out there, nothing 
comes back. So what time is it? 
Where are you in all this? There 
was nothing out here until you 
came along, not even any meaning- 
ful kind of time out here. But there 
has to he some feeling of time , 
Barton !” 

Barton felt a tinge of uneasiness. 
He looked out. It looked cold. 
“What time is it, Barton?” 
“What difference does it make?” 
“Your body has to know. Your 

90 



body works on a timetable doesn’t 
it? Your lungs, expanding, contrac- 
ting regularly. Your heart beating 
so many times regularly — every 
minute . Your blood circulating reg- 
ularly. Look here, Barton. You’re 
a product of a specific environment, 
on a big scale, call it Earth, the 
Solar System. You claim it means 
nothing, time means nothing. But 
your heart beats regularly so many 
times every minute and that’s why 
you’re alive. Where did the ar- 
bitrary rhythm of that beat come 
from, Barton? You were born with 
it. It isn’t anything you control, or 
had anything to do with develop- 
ing, is it? What’s a minute? On 
Earth, it has meaning. Sixty sec- 
onds part of a minute. Sixty min- 
utes make up an hour. What’s an 
hour but a segment of a 24 hour 
day. Where does that figure come 
from? The Earth, Barton. It rotates 
on its axis approximately every 24 
hours. 24 hours make a day, seven 
days a week, so many weeks in a 
month, twelve months make up a 
year. A year, Barton, the Earth ro- 
tates around the sun once a year.” 

For the first time in the basket- 
ball, Barton began to feel some dis- 
comfort. He closed his eyes and 
while they were closed he became 
acutely aware of his heart beating, 
and the expanding and contracting 
of his lungs. 

“You claim there is no Earth any 
more, Barton. No Earth rotating 
on its axis, no Earth rotating 
around the sun. No sun, no moon, 
no time. Why should your heart 
go on beating regularly so many 
times a minute — when there’s noth- 
ing out here that gives a minute 

KENNETH O'HARA 




any meaning? Has time stopped 
here? Is there any time here, Bar- 
ton, when there’s nothing here to 
turn time into measurable seg- 
ments? How can your heart beat so 
many times a minute, a year, a life- 
time if there’s no such thing here 
any more?” 

Barton slowly opened his eyes. 
His hands felt wet. 

“This basketball doesn’t rotate, 
Barton. Doesn’t move toward, away 
from, or around anything. It’s mov- 
ing with the Galaxy but that can’t 
mean anything to you can it? Lis- 
ten, Barton, your body operates 
largely on an unconscious level, but 
what if unconsciously your heart, 
your lungs, your bodily functions 
start to lose their conditioned mem- 
ory of the Earth’s rotation, the reg- 
ularity of its movement on its axis 
and around the Sun that gave your 
birth? What will happen then, Bar- 
ton? What happens to your heart- 
beat if your heart begins to forget 
how long a minute is?” 

Von Ulrich leaned down close to 
Barton’s damp face. 

“What time is it, Barton?” 

Barton started to look out the 
spaceport again, but jerked his 
head in the other direction. He 
didn’t want to look out. Von Ulrich 
waited, but Barton didn’t say any- 
thing. Finally, with a tight smile on 
his face, Von Ulrich got up and 
went to the door. 

“I’ll see you again, Barton. Some 
time.” 

Barton started. “Wait — don’t 
go,” he started to say. But some- 
thing constricted in his throat and 
he hardly even moved his lips, and 
no sound came out at all. 



He saw the cold streak flash past 
the view port. It was Von Ulrich’s 
clinic. Quickly he looked toward 
the wall. The chrono was gone. 
Von Ulrich had taken it with him. 
There was a watch, a wrist watch. 
Barton ran around looking for the 
wrist watch, but he couldn’t find it. 

When he lay down again and 
closed his eyes, he couldn’t rest. He 
couldn’t sleep. His heart beat got 
louder, and after a while that was 
all he could hear, and when he 
tried to figure out how many times 
a minute his heart was, or was not, 
beating, he couldn’t. 

What time was it? 



HE WAR in which all of 
Earth’s outposts were involved, 
lasted thirty years. The basketballs 
were forgotten for a long time, and 
when they were remembered again, 
a special search was rewarded by 
finding only two of them. In the 
first basketball there was no trace 
of the watchman who had been 
abandoned in it almost half a cen- 
tury before, and no indication of 
what had happened to him. 

In the second one, Von Ulrich 
found Barton still lying peacefully 
on the couch, looking hardly any 
different than when Von Ulrich 
had walked out and left him there. 

^ Von Ulrich, who had been re- 
tired for a long time and who was 
unable to get about except in a 
wheel-chair, had requested inclu- 
sion among the search boat’s per- 
sonnel. No one had figured out why 
because even if they found any 
basketballs, it was certain that no 
one would be alive on any of them, 

91 




THE FLOATER 




let alone anyone needing Von Ul- 
rich’s specialized talents. 

Von Ulrich had hoped that 
Barton’s basketball would be found 
and when it was found, he insisted 
on being carried through the inter- 
connecting airlock into the spheroid 
that looked on the outside like a 
dead piece of slag. 

The ship’s medical officer, a man 
young and rather stiff, was shocked 
at first to see Barton lying there, 
but he had a ready explanation as 
he used his stethescope. “Must have 
sprung a leak and let in preserving 
frigidity.” 

“But then how did the leak re- 
pair itself and the temperature re- 
turn to normal?”* Von Ulrich asked 
as he studied Barton’s smooth, un- 
aged face. 

“Dead,” the medical officer said, 
and he dropped the stethescope 
back into his case. 

Von Ulrich gripped the husks of 
his hands together to keep them 
from rattling, and he smiled slowly. 
“Barton didn’t like death much.” 

Zeiger the medical officer looked 
puzzled. “You know this man?” 

“A little. I tried to know him bet- 
ter but a war intervened. His name 
is Harry Barton and he was as- 
signed to duty in this basketball 
fifty- three years and about four 
months ago.” 

Zeiger turned away as though to 
hide an embarrassed reaction. 

“You think I speak out of some 
mental senility, Zeiger? You know 
this man isn’t dead.” 

“He has to be dead.” 

“Not Barton. He would hardly 
approve of your diagnosis. He 
never cared much for diagnosis 

92 



anyway. This is Harry Barton, and 
I’ve preserved — for personal rea- 
sons — his file. I have it with me. 
You want to check his fingerprints? 
You’ll find it’s the same man who 
was assigned to duty here fifty-three 
years ago.” 

“There’s no heart-beat,” Zeiger 
insisted, but not very enthusiasti- 
cally. 

“Better give Barton a more thor- 
ough check,” Von Ulrich said. 

Barton’s heart was beating all 
right. Once every thirty-seven hours 
and fourteen seconds. Regularly, 
strongly, very slowly, but without a 
tremor. The electroencephalograph 
registered brain waves of regular 
rhythm, but of quite low ampli- 
tude. But with a frequency slowed 
to a point so far below normalcy 
that it took a week to establish 
recognizable delta, theta, alpha and 
higher frequency wave-forms. 
Using the electronic stroboscope to 
induce changes in brain-wave reac- 
tion by flicker got results. But the 
frequency didn’t change. When 
they forced Barton’s eyes open and 
used the stroboscope, a slight 
change in theta rhythm signified 
some irritation, but it was mild. 

“Barton never hated anybody,” 
Von Ulrich said. 

It was slow work though, testing 
Barton’s reactions. It was five days 
after the stroboscopic stimulation 
before the termination of the brain 
reactive crescendo. Another week 
before theta rhythm returned to 
normal. 

“. so I finally decided,” Von 
Ulrich told Zeiger, “that Barton 
was unique — he was the impossible. 

KENNETH O'HARA 




The absolutely self-sufficient hu- 
man being, needing nothing but 
himself. I was getting older and I 
figured there was a chance I might 
not get back and the war threat 
and so forth. I was worried about 
leaving Barton. But only for one 
reason.” 

Von Ulrich explained his con- 
cern about what might have hap- 
pened if Barton’s autonomic 
nervous system had lost its identifi- 
cation with the time factor that 
had conditioned it. 

“I figured Barton was absolutely 
self-sufficient, except for the time 
factor. He had to have something 
outside himself relatively to which 
his organs could function in a nec- 
essary regularity.” 

Zeiger poured himself another 
shot of rum and drank it quickly. 

“So he’s still here,” Zeiger said. 
“We’ll have to take him to the 
Martian Base for observation.” 
“Why not, leave him here? Bar- 
ton has a perfect service record. 
He’s never missed an alarm.” 

“But in this condition — ” 

“Let’s see.” Von Ulrich set off an 
alarm. Barton moved, but it took 
him almost a week to move a few 
inches. 

“That’s too slow,” Zeiger in- 
sisted. 

Von Ulrich said, “I’ll turn in a 
complete report on Barton. If the 
authorities want to have him re- 
moved, all right. But maybe they 
won’t. Maybe they’ll decide they 
have a laboratory here for the study 



of a human being that’s more im- 
portant than whatever’s being ab- 
sorbed by those recorders. Barton 
is the thing to watch. I call him the 
‘Adaptable,’ because I believe he 
can adapt to anything, fit himself 
into any situation, any kind of en- 
vironmental circumstance, if he’s 
not interfered with too much, if 
he’s given even a slight chance. You 
see he altered his metabolism in or- 
der to relate to a different, highly 
personalized time. And he hasn’t 
aged much either. God knows how 
long he will live, Zeiger, with such 
a slowed metabolism. And not only 
that — who knows what unique kind 
of personalized time he’s develop- 
ing there inside himself? Who 
knows if we can even make a hu- 
man comparison?” 

“But how did he set this new 
arbitrary time of his? The heart 
beating every thirty-seven hours 
and fourteen seconds?” 

Von Ulrich looked through the 
spaceport, and then pointed when 
the pressure suit drifted past with 
the long-dead Collins perfectly pre- 
served in it and still looking out 
through the face plate. 

“That way,” Von Ulrich said. 
“Collins is our little human satel- 
lite out there, and he rotates around 
the basketball once every thirty- 
seven hours and fourteen seconds.” 

“Well I’ll be damned,” Zeiger 
said. 

“Of our time, that is,” Von Ul- 
rich said. “But our time doesn’t 
mean anything to Barton now.”

THE FLOATER

She was wonderful and Forsdon was in love. But he’d seen the 



future and knew that in five days she was slated for murder! 



CRONUS 

OF THE D. F. C. 

BY LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



A BRIGHT, SUNNY day in May, 
and a new job for me. I found 
the room in the basement of police 
headquarters — a big room, with 
freshly stenciled letters D F G on 
the door, and an unholy conglom- 
eration of tubes, wires and dials 
bulking large in one corner. 

A bright young police cadet sat 
at a desk in the center of the room. 
“Are you Mr. Forsdon?” 

I nodded, and dumped my bag 
beside the desk. 



“Captain Marks is waiting for 
you,” he said and jerked his head 
toward a door to the rear. 

Captain Marks had his office in 
a cubbyhole off the main room. It 
was quite a comedown from the 
quarters he’d occupied upstairs as 
captain of detectives. He’d held 
onto that job past his retirement 
age and, when they were about to 
throw him out on his ear, D. F. C.

came along and he jumped at it. 
The Captain was not the retiring 
type. 

His door was open, and he 
waved me in. “Sit down, Forsdon,” 



he said. “Welcome to the Depart- 
ment of Future Crime.” 

I sat down, and he looked me 
over. A lean, hard face, closely 
cropped white hair, and steely grey 





eyes that looked through a man, 
rather than at him. Small — five feet 
seven, a hundred and forty pounds. 
You looked at him and wondered 
how he’d ever gotten on the force 
in the first place, until you saw his 
eyes. I’d never felt comfortable in 
his presence. 

“Do you know what we have 
here, Forsdon?” he said. 

“Not exactly.” 

“I don’t either — exactly. The 
brass upstairs thinks it’s an expen- 
sive toy. It is. But they’ve given us a 
trial budget to see if it works, and 
now it’s up to us.” 

I nodded, and waited for him to 
go on. He packed his pipe, lit it, 
and then leaned back and let the 
smoke go out. 

“We have an invention,” he said, 
“which I don’t pretend to under- 
stand. You saw the thing?” 

“Yes,” I said. It wasn’t easy to 
overlook. 

“Walker calls it Cronus — for the 
Greek God of Time. It gives us 
random glances around the city on 
what looks like a large TV screen 
— random glances into the future !” 
He paused for dramatic effect, and 
I probably disappointed him. I al- 
ready knew that much. “The pic- 
ture is hazy,” he went on, “and 
sometimes we have a hell of a time 
figuring out the location of what- 
ever it is we’re looking at. We also 
have trouble pinpointing the time 
of an event. But we can’t deny the 
potential. We’ve been in operation 
for three weeks, and already we’ve 
seen half a dozen holdups days be- 
fore they happened.” 

“At least it’s an ideal we’ve al- 
ways worked for,” I offered. “I 

96 



mean, to prevent crime, rather than 
just catch the criminal.” 

“Oh!” he said, and went to work 
on his pipe again. “Maybe I didn’t 
make myself clear. We saw the 
holdups on that screen, but we 
couldn’t prevent a single one. All 
we managed to do was catch the 
criminal a few minutes after he had 
committed the crime. So it raises 
an interesting question: Is it pos- 
sible to change the future?” 

“Why not?” I said. 

Captain Marks thought a mo- 
ment. “It isn’t too critical, where 
the holdups are concerned. The 
criminal is caught immediately, the 
loot is recovered, and the victim 
goes his way thinking kind thoughts 
about the efficiency of the police 
force. But what about assault, or 
rape, or murder? Apprehending 
the criminal ten minutes later won’t 
be much comfort to the victim. 
But now that you’re here to follow 
up the leads given us by Cronus — 
well, we’ll see what we can do. 
Come on. I want you to meet 
Walker. And Cronus!” 

Walker — Dr. Howard F. Walker 
— was huddled over his creation. 
There was no doubt about it being 
his baby, as you could see from the 
way his hands caressed the dials. 
He was a gangling-looking man, six 
feet one, maybe 170 pounds, fifty- 
odd years old. He had a long neck, 
an overly pronounced Adam’s ap- 
ple, and thinning hair. He wore 
thick glasses, his face was gentle 
and dignified, and he looked like a 
very tired university professor. 

He didn’t hear us come up, and 
the Old Man waited quietly until 
he noticed us. 



LLOYD BIGGLE. JR. 




“Walker,” the Old Man said, 
“this is Forsdon, our new detec- 
tive.” 

He nodded at me. “Cronus has 
something,” he said. “If I can find 
it again . 

He turned to his dials. 

“That’s one of our problems,” 
Captain Marks said. “Once we 
focus on a crime, it’s sometimes 
hard to locate it again. The time 
interval between the present and 
the time the crime is committed 
keeps getting less. It takes a differ- 
ent adjustment each time . .” 

His voice trailed away, and I 
looked from Walker to the six- 
foot-square screen above his head. 
Shadows flitted about on the 
screen. A female shadow walking 
along the street holding a child 
shadow by the hand. Shadow air- 
cars moving along jerkily. A row of 
male shadows grotesquely posed 
along a bar, their glasses making 
bright blotches in the picture. A 
room, and a female shadow moving 
around a table. The future re- 
vealed by Cronus was a shadow 
world and the only way you could 
tell male from female was by their 
dress. 

The scene kept shifting. A park, 
with trees, and lounging adults, and 
running children. A room with peo- 
ple seated around a table, a read- 
ing room, perhaps at the public li- 
brary. A large living room, with an 
old-fashioned fireplace, and a 
bright blotch that was the fire. An- 
other smaller room, a female shad- 
ow . 

“That’s it!” Walker said sudden- 
ly. He moved a motion picture 
camera into position, and pressed a 

CRONUS OF THE D. F. C. 



button. It whirred softly as we 
watched. 

A nondescript living room. A fe- 
male shadow. She threw up her 
hands and stood transfixed for a 
horrible moment or two. A male 
shadow bounded into the picture — 
a giant male shadow. She turned to 
run, and he caught her from be- 
hind. His hand moved upward. 
Something glittered in it, and he 
brought it down. He struck twice, 
and the female crumpled to the 
floor. He whirled, ran toward us, 
and disappeared. The camera 
ground on, recording the image of 
that shapeless shadow on the floor. 

Abruptly the scene changed. A 
restaurant, with crowded tables and 
jerkily moving robot-servers. Walk- 
er swore softly and turned off the 
camera. 

“That’s all I got before,” he said. 
“If I could come on it from a dif- 
ferent angle, maybe we could lo- 
cate the place.” 

“When?” the Captain asked. 

“Seven to twelve days.” 

It hit me, then, like a solid wal- 
lop on the jaw. I’d been looking 
into the future. 

“Plenty of time,” the Captain 
said. “But not much to go on.” He 
looked at me. “What do you 
think?” 

“Might be able to identify the 
man,” I said. “He’ll be well over 
six feet — wouldn’t surprise me if he 
were six-eight or nine. He’ll have 
the build of a male gorilla. And he 
limps slightly with his right foot.” 

“Not bad. Anything else?” 

“It’s an apartment or a hotel 
room,” I said. “I’d guess an apart- 

97 




ment. The scanner screen by the 
door means it’s either relatively 
new, or it’s been remodeled. The 
living room has a comer location, 
with windows on two sides. It’s 
hard to say for certain, but I be- 
lieve there’s an old-fashioned sofa 
— one of those with a back on it — 
along the far wall.” 

Walker slumped into a chair. 
“You make me feel better,” he 
said. “I thought there was next to 
nothing to go on.” 

Captain Marks nodded. “But you 
missed one thing.” 

“What’s that?” 

“Our assailant is left-handed. 
Also — the limp may be something 
temporary. All right, Forsdon, it’s 
all yours. Seven to twelve days, and 
you’d better plan on -seven.” 

He went back to his office, and I 
looked at Walker. “Can you give 
me any idea at all as to the loca- 
tion?” 

“I can draw you a circle on the 
map, but it’s only about fifty-fifty 
that you’ll find the place inside the 
circle.” 

“That’s better than nothing.” 
“There is one thing,” Walker 
said. “I’d like to have you wear 
this. Everywhere.” 

A band of elastic, with what 
looked like dark beads placed on it 
at intervals. 

“It’s an arm band,” Walker said. 
“Cronus picks up these beads as 
bright spots. So I’ll be able to iden- 
tify you if you show up on the 
screen.” 

I hesitated, and he said, “The 
Captain wears one. We know it 
works, because Cronus has picked 
him up twice.” 

98 



I took the arm band, and slipped 
it on. 

I sat down with the map and a 
directory and worked until a tech- 
nician came back with the devel- 
oped film. Walker was still perspir- 
ing in front of Cronus. He hadn’t 
been able to focus on the crime a 
third time. The Captain’s door 
was closed, and his nasal voice was 
rattling the door as he bellowed 
into his telephone. I pulled the cur- 
tains to darken one corner of the 
room, and fed the film into a pro- 
jection machine. 

I ran the film ten times without 
coming up with anything new. I 
couldn’t make out the number on 
the door. I also couldn’t decide 
whether the assailant was a chance 
prowler or someone known to the 
victim. I stopped the camera, and 
made a sketch of the room from 
what I could make out in the way 
of furnishings. 

The Captain came barging out of 
his office, took a quick look at my 
sketch, and nodded approval. 
“We’ll find the apartment,” he 
said. “Then our troubles will really 
start.” 

I couldn’t see that, and I told 
him so. I figured our troubles 
would be nearly over if we found 
the apartment. 

“You think it’s possible to pre- 
vent this crime,” he said. “I don’t. 
Even if we find the apartment and 
identify the man and woman, the 
crime is still going to happen.” 

“Why?” I said. 

“Look at it this way. If we pre- 
vent the crime, it’s not going to 
happen. Right?” 

“Right.” 



LLOYD BIGGLE # JR. 




“And if it’s not going to happen, 
Cronus wouldn’t show it to us. All 
you see on that screen is what will 
happen. As far $s Cronus is con- 
cerned, it already has happened. 
Preventing it is like trying to 
change the past.” 

“We can try,” I said. 

“Yes, we can try. The regular 
force will help us on this one. A 
team of detectives is waiting out- 
side. Tell them what you want 
done.” 

I wanted an apartment living 
room with a corner location and a 
door scanner. It wasn’t as bad as it 
sounded — the scanner was a new 
gadget at that time. Not many 
apartment buildings would have it. 
There was always the chance, of 
course, that an individual had had 
one installed on his own, but that 
was a worry I could postpone. 

I put in a hectic day of trudging 
through apartment buildings and 
squabbling with superintendents, 
but we found it the next morning, 
in a stubby little seven-story build- 
ing on South Central. It was one 
of those apartment buildings that 
went up way back in 1990, when 
the city decided it couldn’t afford 
the luxury of open spaces and 
opened part of old Central Park 
to apartment buildings. This one 
was a midget among the other 
buildings in that development, but 
it had been remodeled recently. It 
had scanner screens. 

After the usual protests, the su- 
perintendent showed me around. 
Most of the occupants weren’t 
home. He let me into a rear apart- 
ment on the sixth floor, and I took 
one look and caught my breath. 

CRONUS OF THE D. F. C. 



I pulled out my sketch, though 
I had it memorized by this time, 
and moved across the room to get 
the right angle. The sofa was there 
— it was an old-fashioned job with 
a back. What had been a bright 
blotch in the picture turned out to 
be a mirror. A blur by the sofa was 
a low table. A chair was in the 
wrong place, but that could have 
been moved. What was I thinking 
about? It was going to be moved . 
Every detail checked. 

“Stella Emerson,” the superin- 
tendent said. “Miss Stella Emerson 
— I think. She never gave me no 
trouble. Something wrong?” 

“Not a thing,” I said. “I want 
some information from her.” 

“I dunno when she’s home.” 

Her next-door neighbor did. I 
went back to headquarters and 
picked up the loose ends on the at- 
tempt to identify our assailant-to- 
be. No luck. 

And at six o’clock that evening, 
I was having a cup of coffee with 
Miss Stella Emerson. 

She was the sort of person it’s al- 
ways a joy to interview. Alert, un- 
derstanding, cooperative — none of 
that petty, temperamental business 
about invasion of privacy. She was 
brunette and twenty-six or twenty- 
seven, maybe five feet four, a hun- 
dred and ten pounds. The pounds 
were well distributed, and she was 
darned nice looking. 

She served the coffee on the low 
table by the sofa, and sat back with 
her cup in her hand. 

“You wanted information?” she 
said. 

I fingered my own cup, but I 
didn’t lift it. “I’d like to have you 

99 




think carefully/’ I said, “and see if 
you’ve ever known a man who 
matches this description. He’s big, 
really big. Heavy set. Maybe six 
feet eight or nine. He’s left handed. 
He might walk with a slight limp 
in his right foot . 

She set her cup down with a 
bang. “Why, that sounds like Mike 
— Mike Gregory. I haven’t seen 
him for years. Not since . 

I took a deep breath, and wrote 
“Mike Gregory” in my notebook. 

“Where was he when you saw 
him last?” 

“On Mars. I was there for two 
years with Civil Service. Mike was 
a sort of general handyman around 
the administration building.” 

“Do you know where he is now?” 

“As far as I know, he’s still on 
Mars!” 

My coffee was scalding hot, but 
I didn’t notice as I gulped it down. 
“I’d like to know everything you 
can tell me about this Mike Greg- 
ory,” I said. “May I take you to 
dinner?” 

As my dad used to say, there’s 
nothing like mixing business with 
pleasure. 

She suggested the place — a queer 
little restaurant in the basement of 
a nearby apartment building. There 
were lighted candles on the tables — 
the first candles I’d seen since 
I was a child. The waitresses wore 
odd costumes with handkerchiefs 
wrapped around their heads. An 
old man sat off in one corner scrap- 
ing on a violin. It was almost weird. 

But the food was good, and 
Stella Emerson was good company. 
Unfortunately, her mind was on 
Mike Gregory. 

100 



“Is Mike in trouble?” she said. 
“He always seemed like such a gen- 
tle, considerate person.” 

I thought of the knife- wielding 
shadow, and shuddered. “How well 
did you know him?” I said. 

“Not too well — he stopped to 
talk with me now and then. I never 
saw him except at work.” 

“Was he — interested in you?” 
She blushed. It was also the first 
blush I had seen in so long I 
couldn’t remember when. I had 
heard it said that the blush went 
out when women did away with 
their two-piece bathing suits and 
started wearing trunks like the men. 
I’m telling you, you can’t have any 
idea about what’s wrong with our 
scientific civilization until you’ve 
seen a girl blush by candlelight. 

“I suppose he was,” she said. “He 
kept asking me to go places with 
him. I felt sorry for him — he 
seemed such a grotesque person — 
but I didn’t want to encourage 
him.” 

“You’re certain about the limp?” 
“Oh, yes. It was very noticeable.” 
“And about his being left-hand- 
ed?” 

She thought for a moment. “No. 
I’m not certain about that. He 
could have been, I suppose, but I 
don’t think I ever noticed.” 

“Is there anything else you re- 
member about him?” 

She shook her head slowly. “Not 
much, I’m afraid. He was just a 
person who came through the office 
now and then. He had an odd way 
of talking. He spoke very slowly. 
He separated his words, just . 
like . this. Most of the girls 
laughed at him, and when they did 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




he’d turn around and walk away 
without saying anything. And — oh, 
yes, sometimes he’d talk about Cali- 
fornia. I guess that was where he 
was from. I never found out any- 
thing about his personal life.” 

“But you didn’t laugh at him?” 
“No. I couldn’t laugh at him. He 
was just too — pathetic.” 

“Have you heard from him since 
you came back?” 

“He sent me a Christmas card 
once. He didn’t know my address 
on Earth, so he sent it to the office 
on Mars so it would be forwarded. 
It didn’t reach me until July!” 
“How long ago was that?” 

“It must be four years ago. It 
was a couple of years after I left 
Mars.” 

I dropped Mike Gregory, and 
tried to learn something about 
Stella Emerson. 

She was twenty-eight. She’d 
worked for two years on Mars, and 
then she came back and got a job 
as private secretary with a small 
firm manufacturing plastic textiles. 
She made enough money for her 
own needs, and was able to save a 
little. She liked having a place of 
her own. She had a sister in Boston, 
and an aunt over in Newark, and 
they visited her occasionally. She 
led a quiet life, with books, and 
visits to the art institutes, and work- 
ing with her hobby, which was pho- 
tography. 

It all sounded wonderful to me. 
The quiet life. A detective gets 
enough excitement on the job. If 
he can’t relax at home, he’s going 
to be a blight on the mortality 
tables. 

We were on our second cup of 
CRONUS OF THE D. F. C. 



coffee, by then, and I motioned the 
old fiddler over to our table. 

His bloodshot eyes peered out 
over a two- week growth of beard. I 
slipped him a dollar bill. “How 
about giving us a melody.” 

He gave us a clumsy serenade 
and Stella reacted just as I’d hoped 
she would. She blushed furiously, 
and kept right on blushing, and I 
just leaned back and enjoyed it. 

I took her back to her apartment, 
and said a friendly farewell at her 
door. We shook hands! 

And she didn’t invite me to 
spend the night with her, which 
was just as refreshing. 

I rode the elevator with chiming 
bells and a wisp of the old man’s 
music floating through my mind. I 
stepped out on the ground level, 
walked dreamily out the door and 
hailed an aircab with my pocket 
signal. 

And just as I was about to step 
in, it stabbed me like the flickering 
knife on Cronus’s screen. She was a 
wonderful girl, and I was falling 
for her, and in seven to twelve days 
— no, nearer five to ten days, now — 
she was going to be murdered. 

“Something wrong?” the driver 
said. 

I flashed my credentials. “Police 
Headquarters,” I said. “Use the 
emergency altitude.” 



W ALKER was crouched in 
front of Cronus, perspiring, as 
usual, but looking infinitely more 
tired. No matter what time I came 
in, he always seemed to be there, 
or there was a note saying he was 
down in his lab in the sub-basement. 



101 




“I haven’t found it again,” he 
said. 

‘That’s all right. We can manage 
with what we have.” 

He frowned irritably. “It’s im- 
portant, confound it. This is just an 
experimental model, and it’s mad- 
deningly inefficient. With money 
and research facilities, we could 
produce one that would really 
work, but we can’t get that kind of 
support by predicting a few pid- 
dling holdups. But a murder, now 
— that would make someone sit up 
and take notice.” 

“Stop worrying about your 
dratted Cronus,” I snapped. “I 
don’t give a damn about that pile 
of junk. There’s a girl’s life to be 
saved.” 

It was unfair, but he didn’t ob- 
ject. “Yes, of course,” he said. “The 
girl’s life — but if I can’t get more 
information . .” 

“I’ve found the apartment,” 1 
told him, “and I’ve found the girl. 
But the man is supposed to be on 
Mars. It doesn’t figure, but it’s 
something to work on.” 

I called the Captain, and gave 
him my report. If he resented my 
bothering him at home, he didn’t 
show it. Any wheel I could get my 
fingers on I set turning, and then I 
went home. I won’t pretend that I 
slept. 

By morning we had a complete 
report from the colonial adminis- 
tration on Michael Rolland Greg- 
ory. Fingerprints, photos, detailed 
description, complete with limp and 
left-handedness. The works. Also, 
the added information that he’d re- 
signed his civil service job eight 
months before »and had left im- 

102 



mediately for Earth, on a Dawn 
Liner scheduled to land at San 
Francisco. 

I swore savagely, got off an ur- 
gent message to San Francisco, and 
left for a dinner date with Stella 
Emerson. And another handshake 
at her apartment door. 

San Francisco did a thorough 
job, but it took time — two more 
days. Michael Rolland Gregory had 
hung around for a while, living in 
run-down rooming houses, and 
holding a series of odd jobs. Two 
months before he had disappeared. 

“He could be anywhere by now,” 
I told the Captain. 

“Including here in New York,” 
the Captain said dryly. 

Two to seven days. 

I took Stella back to her apart- 
ment after our dinner date, and in 
front of the door I said, “Stella, I 
like you.” 

She blushed wonderfully. “I like 
you too, Jim.” 

“Then do me a favor — a very 
special favor.” 

Her blush deepened, with an 
overlay of panic. “I’d — like to, Jim. 
Because I — like you. But I can’t. 
It’s hard to explain, but I’ve always 
told myself that unless I marry a 
man . .” 

I leaned against the wall and 
laughed helplessly while her eyes 
widened in amazement. Then I dis- 
pensed with the handshaking. She 
clung to me, and it might have 
been her first kiss. In fact, it was. 

“I don’t just like you, darling,” I 
said. “I love you. And that wasn’t 
the favor I was going to ask. You 
said you have an aunt over in New- 
ark. I want you to stay with her 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




for a while — for a week or so.” 

“But — why?” 

“Will you trust me? I can’t tell 
you anything except that you’re in 
danger here.” 

“You mean — Mike?” 

“I’m afraid so.” 

“It’s hard to believe that Mike 
would want to harm me. But if you 
think it’s important . .” 

“I do. Will you call your aunt, 
now, and make the arrangements? 
I’ll take you over tonight.” 

She packed some things, and I 
took her to Newark in an aircab. 
Her aunt was hospitable and co- 
operative, albeit a little confused. I 
checked her apartment thoroughly. 
I was taking no chances that the 
aunt’s living room could be the po- 
tential scene of the crime. It wasn’t 
— no similarity. 

“Promise me,” I said, “that you 
won’t go back to your apartment 
for any reason until I tell you it’s 
all right.” 

“I promise. But I may need some 
more things.” 

“Make a list, and I’ll have a po- 
lice woman pick them up for you.” 

“All right.” 

I arranged with the superintend- 
ent of her apartment building to 
have the lights in her apartment 
turned on each evening, and turned 
off at an appropriate time. I put a 
stakeout on her apartment build- 
ing, and on her aunt’s. I got a de- 
tective assigned to shadow her, 
though she didn’t know it, of 
course. Then it was zero to five 
days, and I was quietly going nuts. 

Zero to four days. I walked into 
the D. F. C. room, and Walker 
swarmed all over me. “I found it 



again,” he said. 

“Anything new?” 

“No. Just the same thing. Exact- 
ly the same.” 

“When?” 

“Two to three days.” 

I sat down wearily, and stared at 
Cronus. The screen was blank. 
“How did you manage to invent 
that thing?” I said. 

“I didn’t really invent it. I just 
— discovered it. I was tinkering 
with a TV set, and I changed some 
circuits and added a lot of gadgets, 
just for the hell of it. The pictures 
I got were darned poor, but they 
didn’t seem to be coming from any 
known station — or combination of 
stations, since they kept changing. 
That was interesting, so I kept 
working on it. Then one day the 
screen showed me a big aircar 
smashup. There were about ten 
units involved, and I told myself, 
‘Boy, these Class D pictures are 
really overdoing it.’ About a week 
later I opened my morning paper, 
and there was the same smashup on 
page one. It took a long time to get 
anybody interested.” 

He stopped suddenly as the Cap- 
tain came charging out of his office. 

“Brooklyn,” he called. “Gregory 
was living in a rooming house in 
Brooklyn. He left three weeks ago.” 

A LEAD with a dead end. No one 
knew where he’d gone. It 
proved that he was somewhere in 
the vicinity of New York City, but 
I don’t think any of us ever doubt- 
ed that. 

“One thing is interesting,” the 
Captain said. “He’s using his own 



CRONUS OF THE D. F. C. 



103 




name. No reason why he shouldn’t, 
of course. He’s not a criminal — but 
he is a potential criminal, and he 
doesn’t know that’’ 

I saw, suddenly, that we had a 
double problem. We had to protect 
Stella from Gregory, but we also 
had to protect Gregory from him- 
self. If we could find him. 

“There’s not much we can do,” I 
said, “but keep on looking.” 

It was what Walker called the 
Critical Period. Something had to 
happen on this day or the next, or 
Cronus was a monkey’s dutch 
uncle. 

“If we could only pick Gregory 
up and hold him for a couple of 
days, maybe we could beat this,” I 
told the Captain. “We’ve eliminated 
Stella Emerson, we’ve locked the 
apartment, and caging Gregory 
should snap the last thread.” 

He laughed sarcastically. “You 
think that would solve the prob- 
lem? Listen. We spotted a holdup, 
and I recognized the crook. He had 
a long record. I had him picked up, 
and he was carrying a gun so we 
slapped him in jail on a concealed 
weapons charge. He escaped, got 
another gun, and committed the 
holdup right on schedule. I’m tell- 
ing you, Cronus shows exactly how 
the future is. We can’t change it. 
I’m working as hard as anyone else 
to prevent this, but I know for a 
certainty that sometime today or to- 
morrow the girl and Gregory are 
going to meet in that apartment — 
or in one exactly like it.” 

“We’re going to change it this 
time,” I said. On my way out I 
stopped for a good look at Cronus. 
Nothing but a monster would give 



you a murderer, and a victim, and 
the place and approximate time, 
and make you completely helpless 
to do anything about it. I felt like 
giving Cronus a firm kick in a vital 
part of its anatomy. 

I called off my dinner date with 
Stella and prowled around Man- 
hattan looking for a big man with 
a pronounced limp. One speck of 
dust among the millions. I noticed 
with satisfaction that I was not 
alone in my search. Aircars were 
swooping in low for a quick look at 
pedestrians. Foot patrolmen were 
scrutinizing every passerby. And de- 
tectives would be making the 
rounds of the rooming houses and 
hotels with photographs. Cab and 
bus drivers would be alerted. 

For a man who had no reason to 
hide, Michael Holland Gregory was 
doing an expert job of keeping out 
of sight. 

I radioed police headquarters at 
10:00 P.M., and the Captain’s voice 
exploded at me. “Where the hell 
have you been? The stakeout at the 
girl’s apartment got Gregory. 
They’re bringing him in.” 

I cut off without any of the for- 
malities, and sprinted. I tore down 
the corridor to the D. F. C. room, 
and burst in on what might have 
been a funeral celebration. Walker 
sat with his face in his hands, and 
the Captain was pacing in a tight 
circle. 

“He got away,” the Captain 
snarled. “Snapped the handcuffs 
like toothpicks, beat up his escort 
and ran. The man must have the 
strength of a utility robot.” 

“How did they happen to pick 
him up?” I wanted to know. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR.

“He came strolling down the 
street and started to go into the 
apartment building. Completely in- 
nocent about the whole thing, of 
course. He didn’t have any idea we 
were looking for him.” 

“He has now,” I said. “It’s going 
to be great sport locating him 
again.” 

We had a small army loose in 
the area where Gregory escaped, 
but for all they found he might 
have burrowed into the pavement. 
I called Stella and asked her to stay 
home from work the next day. I 
got the stakeout on her aunt’s 
apartment doubled. 

I was up at dawn, prowling the 
streets, riding in patrolling aircars, 
and I suppose generally making a 
nuisance of myself with calls to 
headquarters. We put in a miser- 
able day, and Gregory might have 
been hiding on Mars, for all the 
luck we had. 

I had my evening meal at a lit- 
tle sandwich shop, and did a leis- 
urely foot patrol along the street by 
Stella’s apartment building. The 
stakeout was on the job, and the su- 
perintendent had Stella’s lights on. 
I stood for a moment in the door- 
way, watching the few pedestrians, 
and then I signaled an aircab. 

“I’d like to circle around here a 
bit,” I said. 

“Sure thing,” the cabbie said. 

We crisscrossed back and forth 
above the streets, and I squinted at 
pedestrians and watched the thin 
traffic pattern. Fifteen minutes 
later we were- back by the apart- 
ment building. 

“Circle low around the build- 
ing,” I said. 

CRONUS OF THE D. F. C. 



“Oh, no! Want me to lose my 
license? I can’t go out of the air 
lanes.” 

“You can this time,” I said. “Po- 
lice.” 

He looked at my credentials, and , 
grunted. “Why didn’t you say so?” 

There was a narrow strip of lawn 
behind the building, with a couple 
of trees, and then a dimly-lit alley. 
The cabbie handed me a pair of 
binoculars, and I strained my eyes 
on the sprawling shadows. I 
couldn’t see anything suspicious, 
but I decided it might be worth a 
trip on foot. 

The third time around I glanced 
at Stella’s lighted windows — the 
rear ones — and gasped. A dark 
shadow clung to the side of the 
building, edging slowly along the 
ledge towards her window. Greg- 
ory. 

“See that?” I said to the cabbie. 

As we watched, he got the win- 
dow open, and disappeared into the 
apartment. 

I tried to radio the men on the 
stakeout, and couldn’t rouse them. 

I called headquarters. Both Walker 
and Captain Marks were out. They 
would be back in a few minutes. 
But I didn’t have minutes left. 

“Skip it,” I said. I snapped out a 
description of the situation, and cut 
off. 

“Can you get close enough to get 
me through that window?” I asked 
the cabbie. 

“I can try,” he said. “But watch 
your step, fellow. It’s a long drop.” 

He hovered close, and I grabbed 
the edge of the window and pulled 
myself through. Gregory faced me 
across the living room, a bewil- 

105 




dered, panicky look on his huge, 
child-like face. I was thinking, how 
stupid can we get? From the way 
he came into Cronus’s picture we 
should have known he didn’t come 
through the door. Stella had come 
through the door, and we just as- 
sumed he was already in the room. 
But who would have thought Greg- 
ory could make like a human fly? 

“All right, Gregory,” I said. 
“You’re under arrest.” 

Tears streaked his face. His jaw 
moved, but no sound came out. 
Suddenly I saw how we had blun- 
dered. This grotesquely oversized 
child meant no harm to anyone. 
Stella was the only person he’d ever 
known who treated him like a hu- 
man being, and he wanted to see 
her again. For some reason he 
couldn’t understand, the police 
were trying to prevent that. Sud- 
denly the entire universe was 
against him, even Stella, and he 
was frightened. 

And dangerous. 

He lunged at me like a pile 
driver, and forced me back towards 
the open window. I got my gun 
out, and he just casually knocked 
it out of my hand. He had me on 
the window ledge, forcing me back 
and all I could see were the stars 
out in space. 

Then the apartment door opened 
and closed and Gregory glanced 
back over his shoulder. 

I screamed. “Run, Stella! 
Run—” 

Then the night air was whistling 
past me. I bounced off an awning, 
crashed into the branches of a tree, 
struggled frantically for a hold, and 
fell through. From the window 

106 



above came a piercing scream . • . 



T HE DOCTOR had a face like 
an owl, and he bent over me, 
making funny clucking noises with 
his tongue. “There we are,” he said, 
when he saw my eyes open. “Not 
bad at all.” 

“What’s good about it?” I said. 
“Young man, you fell six stories, 
and all you have is a broken leg 
and assorted bruises. You ask me 
what’s good about it?” 

“You wouldn’t understand,” I 
said. “Beat it.” Stella’s scream still 
rang in my ears. I twisted, and felt 
the heavy cast on my left leg. My 
mood merged and blended with the 
dull grey of the hospital room. 

A nurse came tiptoing in, and 
smiled blandly when she saw I was 
awake. “You have some visitors,” 
she said. “Do you want to see 
them?” 

I knew it was the Captain. I 
hated to face him, but I said, “Let’s 
get it over with.” 

The Captain loomed in the door- 
way, backed away, and came in 
again. And ahead of him walked 
Stella. 

A different Stella — face pale and 
distorted, eyes registering shock and 
grief, but alive. But very much 
alive. 

I started to get up, and the nurse 
placed a firm hand on each shoul- 
der and held me to the bed. “Not 
so fast, sonny boy,” she said. 

Captain Marks moved up a chair 
for Stella. “Jim,” she said. Her 
voice broke. 

“I’ll tell him,” the Captain said. 
“It seems that Miss Emerson has a 



LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




sister living in Boston. She didn’t 
know anything about our problem, 
and she came down this evening 
for a visit. She had a key to Miss 
Emerson’s apartment, and she 
walked in just at the right time to 
play a leading role in Cronus’s 
drama.” 

“Was she—” 

“No. Thankfully, no. Her condi- 
tion is serious but she’ll be all right 
again. The knife missed a vital spot 
by a fraction.” 

I relaxed. “What happened to 
Gregory?” 

“He tried to go out the way he 
came in. There wasn’t any tree to 
break his fall. And one other thing. 
I have an urgent message for you 
from Walker.” 

I glanced at the slip of paper. 
“Jim — for God’s sake, stay out of 
aircars!” 

“Cronus showed us your fall half 
an hour before it happened. From 
our angle, it looked as if you fell 
out of the aircab that was hovering 
over the building. Some time in the 
next twenty-four hours, Walker cal- 
culated, but we couldn’t reach 
you.” 

“It wouldn’t have made any dif- 
ference,” I said. “You know your- 
self . .” 

“Yes,” he said. “I know.” 

His voice rambled on, while my 
eyes met Stella’s. “So Cronus can 
show us the future,” I heard him 
say, “but he can’t change it, and 
neither can we.” 

“Cronus changed mine,” I said, 



still looking at Stella. 

The Captain took the hint, and 
left. 

Five minutes later the phone 
rang, and I reached around Stella 
to answer it. It was Walker, and 
Stella held her face close to mine 
and listened. 

“Just called to offer my congratu- 
lations,” Walker said. 

“Congratulations for what?” 
“For your wedding. Cronus just 
spotted it.” 

I swore, but I kept it under my 
breath. “I haven’t even asked the 
girl,” I said, “and don’t tell me I’m 
wearing that stupid arm band at 
my wedding, because I’m not.” 
“No, you’re on crutches. But the 
Captain is standing up with you, 
and he’s wearing his.” 

“All right,” I said. “When is this 
glad event going to take place?” 
“Four to eight days.” 

I slammed down the receiver, 
and kissed Stella’s blushing face. 
“Cronus says we’re getting married 
in four to eight days, and this is 
one time that monstrosity’s going to 
be wrong. We’ll get married to- 
morrow.” 

“All right, Jim, if you want to. 
But . .” 

“But what?” 

“This is May twenty-eighth, and 
I want to be a June bride.” 

We were married five days later, 
and we went to Arizona on our 
honeymoon. I’d done some check- 
ing, and I knew Arizona was well 
outside of Cronus’s range. • • •

THE RUMBLE 

The noise was too much for him. 
He wanted quiet — at any price . 



BY STEPHEN BARTHOLOMEW

Illustrated by Ed Emsh 



W HEN JOSEPH got to the of- 
fice his ears were aching from 
the noise of the copter and from 
his earplugs. Lately, every little 
thing seemed to make him irritable. 
He supposed it was because his 
drafting department was behind 
schedule on the latest Defense con- 
tract. His ears were sore and his 
stomach writhed with dyspepsia, 
and his feet hurt. 

Walking through the clerical of- 
fice usually made him feel better. 
The constant clatter of typewriters 
and office machines gave him a 
sense of efficiency, of stability, an 
all-is-well-with- the- world feeling. 

He waved to a few of the more fa- 
miliar employees and smiled, but 
of course you couldn’t say hello 
with the continual racket. 



AND THE 

This morning, somehow, it didn’t 
make him feel better. He supposed 
it was because of the song they 
were playing over the speakers, 
“Slam Bang Boom,” the latest Top 
Hit. He hated that song. 

Of course the National Mental 
Health people said constant music 
had a beneficial effect on office 



workers, so Joseph was no one to 
object, even though he did wonder 
if anyone could ever actually listen 
to it over the other noise. 

In his own office the steady din 
was hardly diminished despite 
soundproofing, and since he was 
next to an outside wall he was sub- 
jected also to the noises of the city. 
He stood staring out of the huge 
window for awhile, watching the 
cars on the freeway and listening to 
the homogeneous rumble and 
scream of turbines. 

Something’s wrong with me, he 
thought. 1 shouldn’t he feeling this 
way. Nerves. Nerves. 

He turned around and got his 
private secretary on the viewer. She 
simpered at him, trying to be 
friendly with her dull, sunken eyes. 



“Betty,” he told her, “I want you 
to make an appointment with my 
therapist for me this afternoon. 
Tell him it’s just a case of nerves, 
though.” 

“Yes sir. Anything else?” Her 
voice, like every one’s, was a high 
pitched screech trying to be heard 
above the noise. 



ROAR 



109 




Joseph winced. “Anybody want 
to see me this morning?” 

“Well, Mr. Wills says he has the 
first model of his invention ready to 
show you.” 

“Let him in whenever he’s ready. 
Otherwise, if nothing important 
comes up, I want you to leave me 
alone.” 

“Yes sir, certainly.” She smiled 
again, a mechanical, automatic 
smile that seemed to want to be 
something more. 

Joseph switched off. 

That was a damn funny way of 
saying it, he thought. “1 want you 
to leave me alone ” As if somebody 
were after me” 

He spent about an hour on rou- 
tine paperwork and then Bob Wills 
showed up so Joseph switched off 
his dictograph and let him in. 

“I’m afraid you’ll have to make 
it brief, Bob,” he grinned. “I’ve a 
whale of a lot of work to do, and I 
seem to be developing a splitting 
headache. Nerves, you know.” 

“Sure, Mister Partch. I won’t 
take a minute; I just thought you’d 
like to have a look at the first model 
of our widget and get clued in on 
our progress so far . .” 

“Yes, yes, just go ahead. How 
does the thing work?” 

Bob smiled and set the grey steel 
chassis on Partch’ s desk, sat down 
in front of it, and began tracing the 
wiring for Joseph. 

It was an interesting problem, or 
at any rate should have been. It 
was one that had been harassing 
cities, industry, and particularly air- 
fields, for many years. Of course, 
every one wore earplugs — and that 
helped a little. And some firms had 

110 



partially solved the problem by us- 
ing personnel that were totally deaf, 
because such persons were the only 
ones who could stand the terrific 
noise levels that a technological 
civilization forced everyone to en- 
dure. The noise from a commercial 
rocket motor on the ground had 
been known to drive men mad, and 
sometimes kill them. There had 
never seemed to be any wholly 
satisfactory solution. 

But now Bob Wills apparently 
had the beginnings of a real an- 
swer. A device that would use the 
principle of interference to cancel 
out sound waves, leaving behind 
only heat. 

It should have been fascinating 
to Partch, but somehow he couldn’t 
make himself get interested in it. 

“The really big problem is the 
power requirement,” Wills was 
saying. “We’ve got to use a lot of 
energy to cancel out big sound 
waves, but we’ve got several pos- 
sible answers in mind and we’re 
working on all of them.” 

He caressed the crackle-finish 
box fondly. 

“The basic gimmick works fine, 
though. Yesterday I took it down to 
a static test stand over in building 
90 and had them turn on a pretty 
fair-sized steering rocket for one of 
the big moon-ships. Reduced the 
noise-level by about 25 per cent, it 
did. Of course, I still needed my 
plugs.” 

Joseph nodded approvingly and 
stared vacantly into the maze of 
transistors and tubes. 

“I’ve built it to work on ordinary 
60 cycle house current,” Wills told 
him. “In case you should want to 

STEPHEN BARTHOLOMEW 




demonstrate it to anybody.” 

Partch became brusque. He liked 
Bob, but he had work to do. 

“Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell 
you what, why don’t you just leave 
it here in my office and I’ll look it 
over later, hm?” 

“Okay, Mr. Partch.” 

Joseph ushered him out of the 
office, complimenting him profuse- 
ly on the good work he was doing. 
Only after he was gone and Joseph 
was alone again behind the closed 
door, did he realize that he had a 
sudden yearning for company, for 
someone to talk to. 

Partch had Betty send him in a 
light lunch and he sat behind his 
desk nibbling the tasteless stuff 
without much enthusiasm. He won- 
dered if he was getting an ulcer. 

Yes, he decided, he was going to 
have to have a long talk with Dr. 
Coles that afternoon. Be a pleasure 
to get it all off his chest, his feeling 
of melancholia, his latent sense of 
doom. Be good just to talk about it. 

Oh, everything was getting to 
him these days. He was in a rut, 
that was it. A rut. 

He spat a sesame seed against the 
far wall and the low whir of the 
automatic vacuum cleaner rose and 
fell briefly. 

Joseph winced. The speakers 
were playing “Slam Bang Boom” 
again. 

His mind turned away from the 
grating melody in self defense, to 
look inward on himself. 

Of what, after all, did Joseph 
Partch’s life consist? He licked his 
fingers and thought about it. 

What would he do this evening 

THE RUMBLE AND THE ROAR 



after work, for instance? 

Why, he’d stuff his earplugs back 
in his inflamed ears and board the 
commuter’s copter and ride for half 
an hour listening to the drumming 
of the rotors and the pleading of 
the various canned commercials 
played on the copter’s speakers loud 
enough to be heard over the engine 
noise and through the plugs. 

And then when he got home, 
there would be the continuous yam- 
mer of his wife added to the Tri-Di 
set going full blast and the dull 
food from the automatic kitchen. 
And synthetic coffee and one stale 
cigaret. Perhaps a glass of brandy 
to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles ap- 
proved. 

Partch brooded. The sense of 
foreboding had been submerged in 
the day’s work, but it was still 
there. It was as if, any moment, a 
hydrogen bomb were going to be 
dropped down the chimney, and 
you had no way of knowing when. 

And what would there be to do 
after he had finished dinner that 
night? Why, the same things he had 
been doing every night for the past 
fifteen years. There would be Tri- 
Di first of all. The loud comedians, 
and the musical commercials, and 
the loud bands, and the commer- 
cials, and the loud songs . 

And every twenty minutes or so, 
the viewer would jangle with one 
of Felicia’s friends calling up, and 
more yammering from Felicia. 

Perhaps there would be company 
that night, to play cards and sip 
drinks and talk and talk and talk, 
and never say a thing at all. 

There would be aircraft shaking 
the house now and then, and the 

111 




cry of the monorail horn at inter- 
vals. 

And then, at last, it would be 
time to go to bed, and the murmur 
of the somnolearner orating him on 
the Theory of Groups all through 
the long night. 

And in the morning, he would be 
shocked into awareness with the 
clangor of the alarm clock and 
whatever disc jockey the clock ra- 
dio happened to tune in on. 

Joseph Partch’s world was made 
up of sounds and noises, he decid- 
ed. Dimly, he wondered of what 
civilization itself would be con- 
structed if all the sounds were once 
taken away. Why, after all, was the 
world of Man so noisy? It was al- 
most as if — as if everybody were 
making as much noise as they could 
to conceal the fact that there was 
something lacking. Or something 
they were afraid of. 

Like a little boy whistling loudly 
as he walks by a cemetery at night. 

Partch got out of his chair and 
stared out the window again. There 
was a fire over on the East Side, a 
bad one by the smoke. The fire en- 
gines went screaming through the 
streets like wounded dragons. 
Sirens, bells. Police whistles. 

All at once, Partch realized that 
never in his life had he experienced 
real quiet or solitude. That actual- 
ly, he had no conception of what an 
absence of thunder and wailing 
would be like. A total absence of 
sound and noise. 

Almost, it was like trying to 
imagine what a negation of space 
would be like. 

And then he turned, and his eyes 
fell on Bob Wills’ machine. It could 



reduce the noise level of a rocket 
motor by 25 per cent, Wills had 
said. Here in the office, the sound 
level was less than that of a rocket 
motor. 

And the machine worked on or- 
dinary house current, Bob had said. 

Partch had an almost horrifying 
idea. Suppose . 

But what would Dr. Coles say 
about this, Partch wondered. Oh, 
he had to get a grip on himself. 
This was silly, childish . 

But looking down, he found that 
he had already plugged in the line 
cord. An almost erotic excitement 
began to shake Joseph’s body. The 
sense of disaster had surged up 
anew, but he didn’t recognize it yet. 

An absence of sound ? No! Silly! 

Then a fire engine came tearing 
around the comer just below the 
window, filling the office with an 
ocean of noise. 

Joseph’s hand jerked and flicked 
the switch. 

And then the dream came back 
to him, the nightmare of the night 
before that had precipitated, un- 
known to him, his mood of fore- 
boding. It came back to him with 
stark realism and flooded him with 
unadorned fear. 

In the dream, he had been in a 
forest. Not just the city park, but a 
real forest, one thousands of miles 
and centuries away from human 
civilization. A wood in which the 
foot of Man had never trod. 

It was dark there, and the trees 
were thick and tall. There was no 
wind, the leaves were soft under- 
foot. And Joseph Partch was all 
alone, completely alone. 

And it was — quiet.

Doctor Coles looked at the pa- 
tient on the white cot sadly. 

“I’ve only seen a case like it once 
before in my entire career, Dr. 
Leeds.” 

Leeds nodded. 

“It is rather rare. Look at him — 
total catatonia. He’s curled into a 
perfect foetal position. Never be 
the same again, I’m afraid.” 

“The shock must have been tre- 
mendous. An awful psychic blow, 
especially to a person as emotion- 
ally disturbed as Mr. Partch was.” 
“Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills’

sion occurs. Now we shall send our 
animate object.” 

He untied the goat and, with 
some difficulty, hauled the animal 
by its collar to the transmitter. 
There the goat balked and Dr. 
Angstrom, having got its head 
through the door, got behind it and 
shoved heartily, hanging onto the 
edge of the door so he could shut 
it quickly when the goat was inside. 

As goats will, the goat suddenly 
changed its mind and leaped into 
the transmitter. Caught off balance, 
Dr. Angstrom fell in after it — and 
the door, given a last frantic jerk, 
slammed on them both. 

There were gasps of horror and

amazes me is that it didn’t kill 
Partch altogether. Good thing we 
got to him when we did.” 

Dr. Coles rubbed his jaw. 

“Yes, you know it is incredible 
how much the human mind can 
sometimes take, actually. As you 
say, it’s a wonder it didn’t kill him.” 
He shook his head. 

“Perfectly horrible. How could 
any modern human stand it? Two 
hours, he was alone with that ma- 
chine. Imagine — two hours of total 
silence!” • • • 



alarm from the scientists, but I held 
up my hand to calm them. 

“There’s no danger, gentlemen,” 
I said. “It’s just as well this way. 
I happen to know that Dr. Ang- 
strom’s next step, after proving to 
you with the goat that animate ob- 
jects could be transmitted, was to 
prove that human beings also could 
be transmitted. He planned to be 
his own first subject.” 

With serene confidence, I went 
to the receiver and threw open the 
door. Just as I had anticipated, the 
goat leaped out, unharmed, fol- 
lowed by Dr. Angstrom. 

“I told you animate objects could 
be transmitted successfully,” said 
the goat triumphantly. 

“Baa!” said Dr. Angstrom, and 
began eating the tablecloth. • • •

conference table and drifted out of 
the big spheroid room to their fam- 
ilies, wives — wherever they wanted 
to go. 

Now only Thompson and the 
Russian remained in the room. 
They walked ten paces away from 
one another in the classic tradition 
of honorable dueling, turned, and 
fired. They fell almost at the same 
time. Morten rushed over to 
Thompson was was already dead, 
having died instantly with a bullet 
in his heart. Morten saw that the 
Russian had a bullet hole just above 
his left eye. 

Thompson, foreseeing this pos- 
sible situation, had gotten a promise 
from Morten that he would press 
the button that would annihilate 
Russia, in case Thompson was dead 
or incapacitated. That would leave 
the United States the sole victor in 
the last great global struggle to es- 
tablish once and for all, world wide, 
the true faith. 

Morten fought a brief struggle 
with his conscience, then ran out of 
the room, leaving the console un- 
touched. The United States and 
Russia still survived. Morten’s fam- 
ily was still safe. He ran toward 
the bank of elevators to get out of 
the Cellar. He hadn’t been out of 
the Cellar for a long, long time. 

The President of the United 
States switched off the T.V., and 
poured another martini. “You want 
another?” he asked the Minister of 
Peace. “No, sir, Mr. President.” v 



For a while they said nothing as 
they looked out the window at the 
peaceful sunshine, and watched 
birds settle in the trees. 

“They ran their own course,” the 
Minister of Peace said. “Just the 
same, it was an unpleasant thing to 
see.” 

“Inevitable,” said the President. 
“There wasn’t any other possible 
way to handle them.” 

Psychiatry would never have al- 
tered their rigid mold, he knew. It 
was a strangely funny thing, that 
spontaneous rebellion all over the 
world. The people putting a stop 
to the whole damn vicious histori- 
cal show. But they had done it. 
The lie had been given to all the 
historical pessimists like Spencer 
and Toynbee and Marx and all the 
others who had said the same 
things, whether they really had ad- 
mitted it or not. The people, acting 
out of intuitive realization that they 
faced annihilation, had reacted en 
masse and taken things over for 
themselves. Now you couldn’t find 
even a water pistol anywhere in the 
world. 

The U.N. Cellar had been walled 
off, turned into a kind of sani- 
tarium. Its occupants had never 
known the truth about the outside. 
Thompson and that absurd Rus- 
sian were dead. But what about the 
others in the Cellar, living there 
still and believing they were the 
only few survivors left in the world? 

Poor bastards, the President 
thought. And then he thought of 
that statement by Sartre. The one 
about hell being a restaurant where 
you served yourself • • •

The army is looking for a throw- 
away engine to power its light- 
weight combat vehicles, hoping to 
find an engine cheaper to abandon 
when it breaks down than to repair. 
The need for such an engine, to- 
gether with faster and lighter vehi- 
cles, has been brought about by 
changes in modern warfare. Em- 
phasis today is on getting troops 
where needed in a hurry. An ideal 
engine would be a super powerplant 
giving one horsepower per cubic 
inch of displacement, one horse- 
power per pound of weight, and 
costing less than one dollar per 
horsepower. The answer to the 
military problem lies in the engine 
that could be “factory tested, 
sealed, issued and written off”. A 
promising engine for the future is 
the small gas turbine, operating on 
regenerative cycles. 

Rice fields of the future may look 
like stagnant ditches. Use of algae, 
the lowly forms of plant life that 
fix nitrogen from the air, to trans- 
mit food to rice plants and other 
crops of economic value is advo- 
cated by Dr. Mary Belle Allen of 
the University of California. She 
has succeeded in cultivating a group 
of nitrogen-fixing organisms known 
as blue-green algae. Under green- 



house conditions, these organisms 
can promote growth of rice plants 
that would not thrive without 
them. Tests show that rice plants 
grown in sand and nutrient chemi- 
cals will not grow without the 
photosynthetic help of the blue- 
green algae. The possibility of im- 
proving rice crops by flooding the 
paddies with the algae would aid 
the world’s production immeasur- 
ably and certainly reduce starvation 
statistics in critical areas. 

Amateur radio operators or hams 
can help track the earth satellite 
to be launched during the Inter- 
national Geophysical Years starting 
July 1. The signal sent out at 108 
megacycles by the moonlet’s three- 
pound transmitter should be de- 
tectable over much of the United 
States, and amateurs could make a 
real contribution by setting up 
equipment to listen in. Such a ham 
network would not only back up the 
main system of Minitrack antennas, 
but would also allow nearly vertical 
observations of the satellite at some 
station during each orbit. Calibra- 
tion of the tracking system is ex- 
pected to be the most difficult job. 
For the amateur tracking installa- 
tion, two antennas would be set up 
500 to 1000 feet apart on an east- 
west line in a field remote from 
population centers, industrial 
plants, busy highways and other 
sources of radio noise. By compar- 
ing the path length from the satel- 
lite’s transmitter to one station 
with a path length to a second 
antenna, the satellite’s position in 
its earth-girdling orbit can be 
found.

A monkey's bone marrow may 
some day be used to save the life 
of a person doomed by fatal disease 
or atomic radiation. Monkey bone 
marrow, transplanted or injected 
into the body, will go on function- 
ing as a blood cell factory, produc- 
ing monkey blood cells to circulate 
through the human arteries and 
veins. While human application is 
in the future, at the A.E.C. Oak 
Ridge Laboratory in Tennessee, the 
bone marrow of a rat has saved the 
life of a mouse. From this experi- 
ment may come the knowledge of 
the genesis of radiation-caused leu- 
kemia. The bone marrow treat- 
ment will prevent this leukemia in 
mice if given right after the radia- 
tion. The day of the crucial experi- 
ment of putting marrow from ani- 
mal into a human may be far dis- 
tant, but when the problem of 
which animal to use as a source of 
supply is solved, the method may 
be used to treat victims of bone 
marrow disease and perhaps to al- 
low larger, more effective doses of 
X-rays or other radiation treatment. 

Scientists have taken a long look 
into the future and come up with 
this picture of tomorrow’s mer- 
chant fleet: Fishing vessels will be 
floating factories remaining at sea 
all year. Finished products will go 
straight from ship to market. Min- 
ing ships will drill for oil on con- 
tinental shelves far from their 
sources of fuel and supplies. Rough 
weather will not cause seasickness 
on tomorrow’s atomic vessel. Ships 
will simply submerge beneath the 
waves into undisturbed waters. Ice- 
breakers will be able to smash 



through Arctic ice packs and re- 
main locked in frozen waters all 
winter if necessary, because space 
which would be used for fuel today 
can be used for food tomorrow. 
These predictions are based on 
known advantages of atomic power. 

Patients of the future may have 
their drugs built to order. One such 
drug has already been synthesized 
and found to reduce blood pressure 
in patients with hypertension. The 
drug named BAS is related to sero- 
tonin, a natural body chemical 
found in blood serum, and was de- 
vised to block serotonin’s action in 
the body. In the designing of the 
drug, researchers had to make it 
effective when taken by mouth, 
with a low inhibition index and not 
reversible in its action, and lacking 
effect on the central nervous sys- 
tem. Future man-designed drugs 
may have many other such features 
planned right into them before pro- 
duction begins. 

Atomic energy may turn the Ant- 
arctic into a seventh habitable con- 
tinent. Sir Raymond Priestly, who 
accompanied Shackleton to the 
Antarctic in 1908, foresees that 
frozen mass as the world’s surplus 
food locker as well as a great min- 
ing area. It would provide a ver- 
min-free store for periodical food 
surpluses, where they could be pre- 
served against the need of future 
generations. Once mineral deposits 
are found, the entire mining opera- 
tion could be moved underground. 
Atomic power could be used to 
maintain populations. Antarctic 
gales might also be harnessed as

another source of power; making it 
practically self sufficient. 

A solid fuel, neither coal nor as- 
phalt, may soon be on the market. 
Latest mining and transportation 
methods are put to use in a new 
processing plant, to be completed 
in the near future, which will make 
high purity coke out of an unusual 
geological formation found near 
Salt Lake City. The formation, 
known as Uintaite, is of hydro- 
carbon origin. Black, like coal, it 
contains more resin and less sulphur 
than asphalt. Petroleum-like by- 
products, similar to those from oil 
shale, are expected to be recovered 
in the coking process. Several com- 
panies have joined together to 
adapt the hydrocarbon mineral to 
fuel use. They have renamed it 
Gilsonite. 

Tornados will warn of their ap- 
proach with a scream on a loud- 
speaker if plans of the U.S. 
Weather Bureau are successful. The 
technique, known as Doppler radar, 
spots the target by its relative speed 
and the output of such radar is in 
the audible range. One aim is to 
spot the tornado before its swoop- 
ing funnel, so lethal where it 
sweeps the ground, is formed. Its 
high winds, thought to whirl at 
speeds up to 300 miles per hour, 
would contrast with those of the 
surrounding air to produce the 
audible sound on Doppler radar. 
Moisture carried by the winds 
would reflect the radar waves. A 
simplified model is now being 
tested, using two 30-inch antennas 
with an output of five watts. This

device has scanned the clouds and, 
when conditions are good, has 
shown turbulent motion within 
them. Their design will be im- 
proved for an operational instru- 
ment that will soon be field tested. 

By 1980 the world’s scheduled air- 
lines will be flying 480,000,000,000 
passenger miles annually. This thir- 
teenfold increase over today’s mile- 
age will come about through the 
use of atomic freighters flying non- 
stop between any two points on the 
earth’s surface at supersonic speeds 
of 1,000 miles per hour. Passenger 
planes will be capable of traveling 
600 miles per hour, carrying 150 
passengers on non-stop flights of up 
to 4,000 miles. And civil transport 
aircraft, weighing upward of 
1,000,000 pounds and powered by 
the atom, will be in regular service.
