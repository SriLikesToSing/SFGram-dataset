Could you write 
for television? 

ByMaxShulman 



X rankly, I don’t know. But this I do know: 
when I was running the Dobie Gillis show, 
I often paid $2,500 and more for scripts 
turned out by people who should have been 
arrested for impersonating writers. 

How such people got to be high-priced 
TV writers is not as mysterious as it seems. 
Television is an insatiable maw into which 
scripts must be fed at a rate unprecedented 
in the history of entertainment. It is a grate- 
ful producer indeed who consistently gets 
scripts which have been written with real 
understanding of television’s powers and 
limitations. 

To help train new TV writers, I joined 
with Rod Serling (creator of The Twilight 
Zone, winner of five Emmy Awards) and 
ten other leading authors* to start the 
Famous Writers School. We pooled every- 
thing we had learned in our long years in the 
business to devise four professional writing 
courses that men and women, seriously in- 
terested in writing, could take in their own 
homes in their free time. 




story (or documentary or* commercial) in 
quick, visual sequences . the knack of 
thinking and writing with a lens! 

Through a series of carefully planned 
assignments, you learn as you write— guided 
by our own specially organized textbooks. 
Your assignments are painstakingly edited 
and revised by our staff of instructors, them- 
selves all professional writers. Under our 
supervision, an instructor works with you 
by mail, much as a producer or editor works 
with an established writer. 

Do you have an aptitude for writing? 

To help you (and us) decide whether you’ve 
got the stuff to be a writer, we have worked 
up a revealing aptitude test. The coupon 
below will bring you a copy, along with a 
4S-page School brochure. If your test indi- 
cates aptitude, you are eligible to enroll in 
the School. You are, however, under no ob- 
ligation to do so. 



How to write “with a lens” 

All four of our courses give you a solid 
foundation in basic writing skills. And three 
of them (Fiction, Non-Fiction and Adver- 
tising) give you training in the techniques 
of television. You learn to build interesting, 
believable characters; how to write dialogue 
that rings true; how to plot convincingly.

that TY demands: the facility to tell your

THE YEAR OF THE HORSE 



T hirty years ago I wrote a fan 
letter to e magarine in which 
I asked the eternal question about 
a definition of science-fiction. A 
copy of the magazine lies on my 
desk now, with a Pitman scrawl 
on the margin to answer my owm 
question: **If literature is a mirror 
to life, then sf is a mirror to possi- 
bility.” I'm sure I considered that 
very clever a generation ago. To- 
day, I'm less certain, unfortunately. 

There are two other things beside 
the old magazine in front of me 
that focus my doubts. One is a pic- 
ture of the surface of the Moon 
as released by Tass, taken as a 
result of mankind's first actual 
landing on an alien world. Man has 
not yet reached that ancient chal- 
lenge, but he has sent his eyes 
ahead and has seen it from the 
close vantage of his own height. 
Here is the mirror of possibility pro- 
vided by science and technology. 

Beside that is a list of choice 
science fiction, I gather. There's an 
organization of about a year's 
standing, calling itself Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America, which is 
planning another set of awards for 
the best stories of the year. They 
have a highly liberal system of nom- 
ination, and this is the list of all 
the stories judged worthy by the 
members. It might be called the 
mirror of possibility provided by 
science fiction — but only by an 
extraordinary exercise of charity. 
There are a few good stories listed 
— enough so that a diligent voter 



can almost fill the categories. But 
perforce, possibility is hardly the 
criterion that must lie behind the 
majority of listings. 

Scientific possibility isn't exactly 
faulted. Grenerally, it simply isn't 
taken into account.^ I know that 
some of the writers of the stories 
read accounts of modem scientific 
progress, but they don't bother 
spilling much of it over into the 
stories. The men who filled the 
1936 issue of the magazine with 
fiction were far more current in 
their real science than those of 
1966. (This observation, of course, 
refuses to accept psionios as scien- 
tific background, because no new 
advance has been made in that for 
6000 years.) 

I gather that writers today aren't 
interested in trying to use knowl- 
edge gained during the past couple 
of decades. The easy excuse seems 
to be that science has caught up 
with science fiction, so the fiction 
can't operate in that field any 
more. I can only assume that they 
really mean that 1966 science has 
caught up with 1936 science fiction 
and that there isn't enough crib- 
bable new stuff in the old stories. 
Certainly with the new frontiers 
available now, a man willing to 
think could find enough speculation 
for three more decades of fictional 
exploration. Btiochemdstry ak>ne of- 
fers a hundred new ideas for novels. 

But it seems that most of the 
writers today in the field don't care 
about that. They have found the new 



4 




realities — the ancient humanistic 
semi-sciences, and they have been 
exploring 1926 sociology and 1916 
analytical psychology, more or less. 
Human values, they tetH me, ww 
have replaced machine values in 
science fiction. Pee, fi, ho hum. 

T iere is no argument about the 
fact that human beings, ra/ther 
than mere gadgets, must be the 
fountainheads of the future. There 
never was any such doubt. If the 
shonber works of H. G. Wells had 
failed to teach this lesson, I could 
have learned it in 1936 from the 
stories of Raymond Z. Gallun and 
several other writers. 

Of course science fiction must 
hold up a mirror to possibility in its 
human characters. But as I look at 
the picture of the moon and consider 
the selected list of our field’s cur- 
rent literature, I wonder where the 
mirror went. The lunar photograph 
shows an aspect of the near future 
that must be met by humans and 
fitted into future human values. Any 
future reality or possibility must 
mirror this, but I cannot recognize 
it in the humanity I find generally 
depicted. Is this the race to launch 
a thousand ships and tackle the 
crater walls of Selene? 

We’re going to need more than 
protaganists for the decades ahead, 
I’m afraid.' We’re going to need 
men of devotion. Don’t tell it to the 
professors of literature who have 
misunderstood the bitter love of 
Fitzgerald to make the current eddy 
in the '^mainstream”, but we are 
even going to need old-fashioned — 
shhh ! — heroes. And we’ll get them, 
because in all our reality we’ve al- 
ways had them and still have them, 
and there is no other possibility to 
a viable race of men. 



Our stories were full of OGW 
heroes once — Oh Gee Whiz heroes. 
They were a bit crude at times as 
they stormed Olympus to throw the 
g»mtlelt ^ hnmBOidl^ in the face of 
the gods, but they were never dull. 
Now, however, time has rolled along. 
New writers have found new values, 
skmted to tiiose vaihms tbat the crit- 
ics of Academe and wooid-be Aca- 
deme can comprehend. Now we have 
tile OGW protagonikst ~ the Oy 
GeWalt protagonist. 

There are goiing to be human and 
technical problems to face and to 
solve eventually in the future possi- 
bilities science mirrors for us. Prob- 
ably some of the men who touch 
down where the photograph was 
taken are going to die — and die 
happily, just as they are now know- 
ingly volunteering to take the wsk. 
And other men will live — by ef- 
forts that would literally be in- 
credible in any fiction. Men have 
done such things in reality through- 
out history. Look up Xenophon’s 
Anabasis or the account of Peary’s 
Polar Expedition, for example. They 
only foreshadow future possibility, 
since they took place in relative 
familiar environments. 

This year, my Chinese friend tells 
me, is the year of the Horse. (I 
haven’t had the bravado to ask 
what last year was.) It, has, of 
course, nothing to do with emotion- 
al narcosis, but refers to a noble 
animal that has often carried 
courageous, intelligent and digni- 
fied humans into deeds of reality 
and of derring-do. By riding very 
hard toward some honest grail, 
science fiction should find this a 
good year in which to catch up to 
1936. I wonder if the next list 
will justify my extreme optimism?

I 

N at Cemp, a Class C Silkie, 
passed the man — and stop- 
ped. 

Something about the other trigger- 
ed a signal in that portion of his 
nervous system which — even in his 
human state — retained a quota of 
his Silkie ability. 



He couldn’t remember — hard as 
he tried — ever having felt that par- 
ticular signal before. 

Cemp turned in the street and 
looked back. The other man had 
paused at the near comer. Then, as 
the light became green, he walked 
briskly toward the far sidewalk. He 
was about Cemp’s height of slightly 
over six feet and seemed about the 



SILKIES IN SPACE

same build — a hundred and ninety 
pounds. 

His hair was dark brown, like 
Cemp’s, and he wore a dark gray 
suit, as did Cemp. Now that they 
were several hundred feet apart, the 
initial impression he had had of 
somebody familiar was not so clear. 

Yet, after only a slight hesitation, 
Cemp rapidly walked after the man, 
presently came up to him, and said 
courteously, “May I speak to you?” 

The man stopped. At close range, 
the resemblance between them was 
truly remarkable, suggesting con- 
sanguinity. Blue-gray eyes, even nose, 
firm nK>uth, shape of ears, strong 
neck, and the very way he held 
himself, were similar. 

Cemp said, “I wonder if you are 
aware that you and I are practically 
twins.” 

The man’s face twisted slightly. 
Lips curled into a faint sneer. The 
eyes gazed scornfully at Cemp. He 
said in an exact replica of Cemp’s 
baritone voice: 

“It was my intent that you notice. 
If you hadn’t this first time, then I 
would have approached you again. 
My name is A-Brem.” 

Cemp was silent, startled. He de- 
tected in the man’s tone and manner 
something akin to hostility. Con- 
tempt, he analyzed wonderingly. 

H ad the other been merely a hu- 
man being who had somehow 
recognized a Silkie in human form, 
Cemp would have considered it one 
of those occasional incidents. Known 
Silkies were sometime sought out by 
humans and insulted. Usually, the 
human who did such a foolish act 



could be evaded, or good-naturedly 
parried, or won over. But once in a 
while a Silkie had to fight. 

But the man’s resemblance to him- 
self indicated that this encounter was 
different. 

As he had these thoughts, the 
stranger’s cynical gray-blue eyes were 
gazing into Cemp’s. The man’s lips 
parted in a derisive smile, showing 
even white teeth. “At approximately 
this moment,” he said, “every Silkie 
in the solar system is receiving a 
communication from his alter ego.” 

He paused; again the insolent 
smile. “I see that has alerted you, 
and you’re bracing yourself — ” 

It was true. Cemp had abruptly 
decided that, whether the other’s 
statement was true or not, he could 
not let him get away. 

The man continued: “ — bracing 
yourself to try to seize me. It can’t 
be done, for I match you in every 
way.” 

“You’re a Silkie?” Cemp asked. 

“I’m a Silkie.” 

By all the logic of Silkie history, 
that had to be a false claim. And 
yet there was the unmistakable, sen- 
sational resemblance to himself. 

But Cemp did not change his 
mind. Even if this were a Silkie, he 
himself had a superiority possessed 
by no other Silkie. In a clash and 
direct contact he had had with an 
alien life form the year before, he 
had learned previously unknown 
techniques of body control. It had 
been decided by the Silkie Authority 
that he should not communicate his 
newly gained ability to any other 
Silkie. He hadn’t. 

That extra knowledge was now 

IF

his advantage — if the other were 
indeed a Silkie. 

“Ready for the message?” said the 
man, insolently. 

Cemp, who was ready for the bat- 
tle of his life, nodded curtly. 

“It’s an ultimatum.” 

“I’m waiting.” Grimly. 

“You are to cease and desist from 
your association with human beings. 
You are commanded to return to the 
nation of Silkies. You have a week 
to make up your mind. After that 
date you will be considered a traitor 
and will be treated as traitors have 
always been, without mercy.” 

Since there was no “nation” of 
Silkies, and never had been, Cemp 
— after considering the unexpected 
“ultimatum”^ for a moment, and dis- 
missing it — made his attack. 

He still didn’t quite believe that 
his “twin” was a Silkie. So he launch- 
ed a minimum electric charge on one 
of the magnetic bands that he could 
use as a human. Enough to render 
unconsciousness but not damage. 

T o his dismay, a Silkie magnetic 
screen as powerful as anything 
he could muster warded off the en- 
ergy blow. So it was a Silkie. 

The stranger stared at him, teeth 
showing, eyes glinting with sudden 
rage. “I’ll remember this!” he snarl- 
ed. “You’d have hurt me if I didn’t 
have a defense.” 

Cemp hesitated, questioning his 
own purpose. It didn’t have to be 
capture. “Look,” he urged, “why 
don’t you come with me to the 
Silkie Authority? If there is a Silkie 
nation, normal communication is the 
best way of proving it.” 



Hie other Silkie began to back 
away. “I’ve done my duty,” he mut- 
tered. “I’m not accustomed to fight- 
ing. You tried to kill me.” 

He seemed to be in a state of 
shock. His eyes had changed again, 
looked dazed now. All the initial 
cocksureness was gone. He continued 
backing away. 

Cemp followed, uncertain. He was 
himself so highly trained a fighter, it 
was hard to grasp that here might be 
a Silkie who was actually not versed 
in battle. 

He soothed: “We don’t have to 
fight. But you can’t expect to deliver 
an ultimatum, and then go off into 
nowhere, as if you’ve done your 
part. You say your name is A-Brem. 
Where did you come from?” 

He was aware, as he spoke, that 
people had stopped in the street 
around them and were watching the 
strange drama of two men — one re- 
treating, the other pursuing, a slow 
step at a time. 

“First, if there’s a Silkie nation, 
where has it — have you — been hid- 
ing all these years?” Cemp persisted. 

“Damn you, stop badgering me! 
You’ve got your ultimatum. You’ve 
got a week. Now leave me alone!” 

The alter ego had clearly not con- 
sidered what he would do after de- 
livering his message. His unprepared- 
ness made the whole incident even 
more fantastic. But he was showing 
anger again; recovering his nerve. 

An electric discharge, in the jag- 
ged form of lightning, rode a mag- 
netic beam of his own creation; 
struck at Cemp, crackling against 
the magnetic screen he kept ready to 
be triggered into existence. 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



f 




The lightning bolt bounced away 
from Cemp, caromed off of a build- 
ing, flashed across the sidewalk past 
several startled people and grounded 
itself on the metal grill of a street 
drain. 

“Two can play that game,” said 
A-Brem in a savage tone. 

Cemp made no reply. The other’s 
electrical beam had been maximum 
power for a Silkie in human form; 
death level potency. Somewhere 
nearby, a woman screamed. The 
street was clearing. People were fall- 
ing away, seeking shelter. 

T he time had come to end this 
madness, or someone might be 
killed. Cemp acted on the evaluation 
that, for a reason that was not clear, 
this Silkie was not properly trained 
and was therefore vulnerable to a 
non-lethal attack by a technique in- 
volving a simple version of Levels of 
Logic. 

He wouldn’t even have to use the 
secret ability he had learned from 
the alien a year before. 

The moment he made up his mind, 
he did a subtle energy thing. He mod- 
ified a specific set of low energy 
force lines passing through his brain 
and going in the direction of A- 
Brem. 

Instantly, there was manifested a 
strange logic implicit in the very 
structure and make-up of life. The 
logic of levels! The science that had 
been derived by human scientific 
method from the great Silkie ability 
for changing form. 

Each life cell had its own rigidity. 
Each gestalt of cells did a specific 
action, could not do other. Once 



stimulated, the “thought” in that 
particular nerve bundle went through 
its exact cycle, and if there were an 
accompanying motion, or emotion 
. that also manifested precisely and 
exactly and without qualification. 

Even more meaningful, more im- 
portant — a number of cell colonies 
could be joined together to form a 
new gestalt, and groups of such clus- 
ters had their special action. 

Such a colony gestalt was the sleep 
center in human beings. 

The method Cemp used wouldn’t 
work on a Silkie in his Class C form. 
Even a B Silkie could fight off sleep. 

This Silkie in human form began 
to stagger. His eyes were suddenly 
heavy-lidded; and the uncontrolled 
appearance of his bodv showed that 
he was asleep on his feet. 

As the man fell, Cemp stepped 
forward and caught the body; pre- 
vented an injurious crash to the con- 
crete sidewalk — and simultaneously 
did a second, subtle thing. 

On another force line, he put a 
message that manipulated the uncon- 
sciousness gestalt in the other’s brain. 
It was an attempt at complete con- 
trol. The sleep cut off perception 
from the environment. Manipulation 
of the unconsciousness mechanism 
eliminated those messages from the 
brain’s stored memory that would 
normally stimulate to wakefulness 
someone who was not really sleepy. 

Cemp was congratulating himself 
on his surprisingly easy capture — 
when the body he held stiffened. 
Cemp, sensing an outside force, drew 
back. To his complete astonishment, 
the unconscious man rose straight 
up into the sky. 



10 



IF 




I n his human form, Cemp was not 
able to determine the nature of 
the energy that could accomplish 
such an improbable feat. He should, 
he realized, transform to Silkie. He 
found himself hesitating. There was 
a rule against changing in full view 
of human beings. 

Abruptly, he recognized that this 
situation was unique; a never-before 
emergency. He transformed to Silkie 
and cut off gravity. 

The ten-foot body, shaped a little 
like a projectile, rose from the 
ground at missile speed. Most of his 
clothes, completely tom, fell to the 
ground. A few tattered remnants re- 
mained, but were swept away by the 
gale winds created by his passage. 

Unfortunately, all of five seconds 
had gone by while he made the trans- 
formation; and since several addi- 
tional seconds had passed before he 
acted, he found himself pursuing a 
speck that was continuing to go 
straight up. 

What amazed him anew, was that, 
even with his Silkie perception, he 
could detect no energy from it, be- 
low it or around it. Yet its speed 
was as great as anything he could 
manage. Accordingly, after moments 
only, he realized that his pursuit 
would hot be in time; and that the 
body of A-Brem would reach an at- 
mosphere height too rarified for a 
human to survive, unless he acted 
promptly. He therefore mercifully 
removed the pressure from the sleep 
and unconsciousness centers of the 
other’s body. 

Moments later, he was disappoint- 
ed — but not surprised — as he sens- 
ed from the other a shift to Silkie 



form; proof that the man had awak- 
ened and could now be responsible 
for himself. 

A-Brem continued straight on up, 
as a full-grown Silkie now; and it 
was presently obvious that he intend- 
ed to risk going through the Van 
Allen belt. Cemp had no such fool- 
hardy purpose. 

As the two of them approached 
the outer limits of the atmosphere, 
Cemp put a thought on a beam to a 
manned telstar unit in orbit around 
Earth. The thought contained simply 
the data about what had happened. 

The message sent, he turned back. 
Greatly disturbed by his experience 
— and being without clothes for 
human wear — he flew straight to 
the Silkie Authority. 

n 

C emp, descending from the sky 
down to the vast building com- 
plex that comprised the central ad- 
ministration for dealing with Silkies, 
saw that other Silkies were also com- 
ing in. He presumed, grimly, that 
thev were there for the same reason 
as himself. 

As the realization came, he scan- 
ned the heavens behind him with his 
Silkie senses, and perceived that 
scores more black spots were out 
there, hurtling closer. Divining immi- 
nent confusion, he slowed and stop- 
ped. Then, from his position in the 
sky, he telepathed Charley Baxter, 
his human contact inside the build- 
ing, proposing a special plan to han- 
dle the emergency. 

Baxter was in a distracted state 
but presently his return thought 

1 1 



SILKIES IN SPACE 




came: “Nat, yours is just about the 
best idea we’ve had. Because you’re 
right. This could be dangerous.” 
There was a pause. Baxter must 
have gotten his message through to 
other of the Special People, for Cemp 
began to record a general Silkie 
warning: 

‘To all Silkies: It would be un- 
wise for too many of you to con- 
centrate at one time in one place. 
So divide into ten groups on the 
secret number system, plan G. Group 
One only approach and land. All oth- 
ers disperse till called.” 

In the sky near Cemp, Silkies be- 
gan to mill around. Cemp, who — 
by the designated number system — 
was in group three, veered off and 
climbed to the upper atmosphere, 
and darted over a thousand miles to 
his home on the southern tip of 
Florida. 

En route, he talked mentally to 
his wife, Joanne, who — like Baxter 
— was one of the Special People. 
And so, by the time he walked naked 
into the house, she had clothes laid 
out for him and knew as much as he 
about what had happened. 

A s Cemp dressed, he saw that she 
was in a womanly state of 
alarm; more concerned than he. She 
instantly believed that there was a 
Silkie nation, and that this meant 
that there would also be Silkie wom- 
en. 

“Admit hr she said tearfully. 
“That thought has already crossed 
your mind, hasn’t it?” 

“I’m a logical person,” Cemp de- 
fended. “So Tve had fleeting 
thoughts about all possibilities. But, 



being sensible, I feel that we have a 
lot of things to explain before I can 
reject what we know of Silkie his- 
tory.” 

It was an accepted part of the 
human-Silkie relationship that Silkies 
had been developed from biological 
experiments. A human sperm and 
ovum had been brought together in 
a test tube under controlled condi- 
tions by scientists who utilized the 
DNA and DNP discoveries. 

“What’s going to become of our 
marriage?” Joanne said in an an- 
guished voice. 

“Nothi"^^ will change.” 

She sobbed, “I’m going to seem 
to you like a native woman of three 
hundred years ago who is married 
to a white man on a South Sea is- 
land — and then white women start 
showing up.” 

The wildness of her fantasying 
astounded Cemp. “It’s not the same,” 
he said. “I promise complete loyalty 
and devotion for the rest of our 
lives.” 

“Nobody can promise anything in 
personal relations,” she said. But his 
words seemed to reassure her after 
a moment. She dried her eyes and 
came over to him and allowed her- 
self to be kissed. 

It was an hour before a phone call 
came from Charley Baxter. The man 
was apologetic for the delay, but ex- 
plain^ that it was the result of a 
conference on Cemp’s future actions. 

“It was a discussion just about 
you in all this,” Baxter said. 

Cemp waited. 

The final decision was to continue 
to not let Cemp intermingle with 
other Silkies — “for reasons that

you know,” Baxter said significantly. 

Cemp surmised that the reference 
was to his secret knowledge — learn- 
ed from the alien. Ever since, he had 
been put on special assignments that 
kept him away from other Silkies. 

Baxter now produced the informa- 
tion that only four hundred Silkies 
had been approached by alter egos. 
“The number actually reported in,” 
he said, “is three hundred and ninety- 
six.” 

Cemp was vaguely relieved, vague- 
ly contemptuous. A-Brem’s claim 
that all Silkies were targets was now 
proved to be propaganda. He had 
already shown himself to be an inept 
Silkie. The lie added one more de- 
grading touch. 

“Some of them were pretty poor 
duplicates,” said Baxter. “Apparent- 
ly, mimicking another body is not a 
great skill with them.” 

However — he now admitted — 
even four hundred was more than 
enough to establish the existence of 
a hitherto unknown group of Silkies. 
“Even if they are untrained,” he 
said, “we’ve absolutely got to find 
out who they are and where they 
came from.” 

“Is there no clue?” Cemp asked. 

No more than Cemp knew. 

“They all got away?” Cemp inter- 
jected, astounded. “No one did bet- 
ter than I?” 

“On the average, not as well,” said 
Baxter. 

It seemed that most Silkies had 
made no effort to hold the strange 
Silkie who confronted them; had sim- 
ply reported in and asked for in- 
structions. 

“Can’t blame them,” said Baxter, 



He continued frankly, “But ^ 
might as well tell you that your fight 
and your reasons for fighting make 
you one of the two dozen Silkies we 
feel we can depend on in this mat- 
ter. So here are your instructions — ” 
He concluded: “Take Joanne with 
you, but go at once!” 

T he sign said: “All the music in 
this building is Silkie music.” 
Cemp, who never listened to any 
other kind, saw the faint distaste 
come into his wife’s face. She caught 
his look and evidently his thought, 
for she said, “All right, so it sounds 
dead level to me, as if it’s all the 
same note — well, anyway, the same 
few notes, close together, repeated in 
various sickening combinations.”. 

She stopped, shook her beautiful, 
blonde head, and said, “I guess Fm 
tense and afraid and need something 
wild and clashy.” 

To Cemp, who could hear har- 
monies in the music that were be- 
yond the reach of ordinary human 
cars, her outburst was but a part of 
the severe emotional reactions to 
things, to which he had long become 
accustomed from diis human female 
he was married to. Women, wed to 
Silkies, had a hard time making their 
peace with the realities of the rela- 
tionship. 

As Joanne had put it more than 
once: “There you are with this phy- 
sically perfect, beautiful male. But 
all the time you’re thinking: ‘This is 
not really a man; it’s a monster that 
can change in a flash either into a 
fish-like thing or a creature of space.’ 
But of course I wouldn’t part with 
him for anything.” 



SILKIES IN SPACE

The music sign was soon behind 
them, and they walked on into the 
interior of the museum. Their desti- 
nation was the original laboratory, 
in which the first Silkie was suppos- 
ed to have been produced. The lab 
occupied the center of the building; 
it had been moved there a hundred 
and ten years before — according to 
a date on a wall plaque at the en- 
trance. 

It had seemed to Baxter that a 
sharper study should be made of the 
artifacts of Silkie history. The entire 
structure of that history was now for 
the first time — for the very first 
time — being questioned. 

It was this task, of re-evaluting the 
past data, that he had assigned to 
Cemp and Joanne. 

The lab was brightly lighted. It 
had only one visitor: a rather plain 
young woman with jet black hair but 
no make-up and with ill-fitting 
clothes was standing at one of the 
tables beside the far doorway. 

As Cemp came in, a thought — 
not his own — touched his mind. He 
started to turn to Joanne. She, being 
one of the Special People, could 
communicate with him on thought 
level, and so he took it for granted 
that the message came from her. 

— Took it for granted, that is, for 
several seconds. 

Belatedly, realization came that the 
thought had arrived on a magnetic 
carrier wave — Silkie level. 

Cemp swung around and stared at 
the black-haired woman. She smiled 
at him, somewhat tensely, he noted; 
and then her thought came, unmis- 
takably: 

“Please don’t give me away. I was 



stationed here to convince any doubt- 
ing Silkie.” 

She dida’t have to explain what she 
meant. The thunder of it was pour- 
ing through Cemp’s mind. 

According to his knowledge, there 
never had been any female Silkies. 
All Silkies on Earth were males, who 
were married to women of the Spe- 
cial People — like Joanne. 

But this black-haired, farmerish 
type was a female Silkie! That was 
what she was letting him know by 
her presence. In effect, by being 
here, she was saying, “Don’t bother 
to search dusty old files. I’m living 
proof that Silkies were not produced 
in somebody’s laboratory two hun- 
dred and thirty years ago.” 

S uddenly Cemp was confused. He 
was aware that Joanne had 
come up beside him; that she must 
have caught his thought, and was 
herself dismayed. The one glimpse 
he had of her face showed that she 
had become very pale. 

“Nat!” her voice came sharply. 
“You’ve got to capture her.” 

Cemp started forward, but it was 
a half-hearted movement. 

Yet, in spite of the uncertainty in 
his actions, he was already having 
logical thoughts: 

Since only hours had gone by from 
the moment that he first saw A-Brem, 
she must have been stationed here 
in advance. She would therefore have 
had no contact with the others. And 
so she wouldn’t know that to a train- 
ed Silkie like himself, she was as 
vulnerable as an unarmed civilian 
opposed by a soldier. 

The black-haired woman must 

IF 



14 




suddenly have had some doubt of 
her own. With an abrupt action, she 
stepped through the door near which 
she had been standing and closed it 
after her. 

“Nat,” Joanne’s voice, high pitch- 
ed, sounded mere inches behind him. 
“You can’t let her get away!” 

Cemp, who had emerged from his 
brief stasis, projected a thought after 
the female Silkie: “I’m not going to 
fight you, but I’m going to stay close 
to you until I have all the informa- 
tion we want.” 

“Too late!” A magnetic carrier 
wave, human-Silkie level, brought 
her thought. “You’re already too 
late.” 

Cemp didn’t think so. He arrived 
at the door through which she had 
disappeared. Was slightly disconcert- 
ed to find it was locked. Smashed 
it with a single, jagged lightning 
thrust of electrical force. Stepped 
through its smoking remains — and 
saw the woman in the act of enter- 
ing a gap in the wall made by a 
sliding door. 

She was not more than three doz- 
en feet away; and she had half-turn- 
ed, and was looking back in his di- 
rection. What she saw was evidently 
a surprise, for a startled look came 
into her face. 

Hastily, her hand came up to 
something inside; and the door slid 
shut. As it closed, Cemp — who was 
ninning toward it — had a glimpse 
of a gleaming corridor beyond. The 
existence of such a secret passage- 
way had too many implications for 
Cemp to consider immediately. 

He was at the wall, fumbling for 
the hidden door. When he could not 



find it after several long moments, 
he stepped back and burned it down 
with the two energy flows from his 
brain which — when they came to- 
gether outside his body — created an 
intense electric arc. It was the only 
energy weapon available to him as 
a human being but it was enough. 

A minute later, he stepped through 
the smoking opening into a narrow 
corridor. 

ra 

T he corridor in which Cemp found 
himself was made of concrete 
and slanted gently downward. It was 
dimly lighted and straight; and so 
he could see the young woman in 
the near distance ahead — about two 
hundred feet. 

She was running, but as a woman 
runs wearing a dress; not very fast. 
Cemp broke into his own high-speed 
lope and, in a minute, had cut the 
distance between them in half. Ab- 
ruptly the concrete ended. Ahead was 
a dirt cave, still lighted, but the 
lights were set at longer intervals. 

As she reached this point, the 
young woman sent him a message 
on a magnetic force Hne; “If you 
don’t stop chasing me. I’ll have to 
use the — ” something not clear — 
“power.” 

Cemp remembered the energy that 
had lifted A-Brem into the sky. He 
took the threat seriously and instant- 
ly modified a magnetic wave to ren- 
der her unconscious. 

It was not so cruel an act as it 
would have been earlier. Now she 
fell like a stone — which was the 
unfortunate characteristic of the un- 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



15 




consciousness gestalt — but it was 
into dirt and not on cement. The mo- 
tion of her body was such that she 
pitched forward on her knees, then 
slid down on her right shoulder. It 
didn’t look too severe for her — so 
it seemed to Cemp as he came closer 
to where she was lying.” 

He had slowed to a walk. Now, 
still wry, he approached the pros- 
trate body, determined not to let any 
special “power” remove her from 
him. He felt only slightly guilty at 
the violent method he had used. His 
reasoning had permitted no lesser 
control over her. The “sleep” shut- 
off on A-Brem had not prevented 
that individual from turning on the 
force field — so Cemp considered it 
to be — that had saved him. 

Quite simply, he couldn’t let her 
get away. 

Because it was an untried situation, 
he acted at once. At this moment, he 
had her; there were too many un- 
knowns for him to delay. 

He knelt beside her. Since she was 
unconscious and not asleep, her sen- 
sory system was open to exterior 
stimulation. 

But for her to answer, she would 
have to be switched to sleep, so that 
the shut-off interior perception could 
flow. 

So he sat there, alternately mani- 
pulating her unconsciousness center 
when he wanted to ask a question, 
and her sleep center for her reply. 
It was like ancient ham radio wi^ 
each party saying “over” when his 
message was completed. 

And, of course, in addition, he 
had to make sure that she did rejrfy 
to his queries. 



W hat he did for that was ask 
one question after another, 
and each time modify a magnetic 
wave with a message to the brain 
cell gestalt that responded to hyp- 
notic drugs. 

The result was a steady mental 
conversation: 

“What is your name?” 

“B-Roth.” 

“Where do you come from?” 
“From home.” 

“Where is home?” 

“In the sky.” A mental image 
came of a small stone body in space; 
Cemp’s impression was of a meteor- 
ite less than twenty miles in diame- 
ter. 

“Where is it now?” 

“About to go around the sun, in- 
side the first planet’s orbit.” 

So she had come to earth in ad- 
vance. So they were all far from 
“home”; apparently had had no pre- 
liminary realization that they were 
out-skilled by Earth Silkies. As a 
result, he was now obtaining this 
decisive information. 

“What is its orbit?” Cemp asked. 
“It goes as far out as the ninth 
planet.” 

Neptune! What a tremendous dis- 
tance! 

Cemp asked quickly, “What is its 
mean speed?” 

Her answer was in terms of Mer- 
cury’s year, which — ^when converted 
to Earth time — came to a hundred 
and ten years per orbit. 

Cemp whistled softly. An imme- 
diate association had leaped into his 
mind. The first Silkie baby had been 
created in a test tube slightly more 
dian two hundred and twenty years 



16 



IF 




before; that was the official history. 
The time involved was exactly twice 
as long as the orbital period of the 
little Silkie planetoid. 

Cemp ended that train of specula- 
tion abruptly, and demanded from 
B-Roth exactly how she herself 
would again find the planetoid, 
which surely must be one of thou- 
sands of similar bodies. 

The answer was one that only a 
Silkie could operate from. She had 
in her brain a set of relationships 
and signal recognition images which 
identified for her the location of the 
Silkie home. 

Cemp made an exact mental copy. 
He was about to begin questioning 
her for details on other matters — 
when an inertia phenomehon effect- 
ed his body. 

He was flung backwards — 

As if he were in a vehicle, his 
back to the forward motion; and the 
vehicle stopped suddenly, but he 
went on — 

Because he always had protection 
against sudden falls, he had been 
moved less than eight feet, when he 
triggered his magnetic field, his only 
screening mechanism as a human. 

T he field he set up could not stop 
gravity pull directly, but it de- 
rived from the earth’s magnetic force 
and gained its power from the force 
lines that passed through this exact 
space. 

As Cemp modulated the lines 
now, they attached themselves to 
flexible metal bands that were 
woven into his clothes, and they held 
him. He hung there a few feet above 
the floor. 



From this vantage point he was 
able to examine his situation. 

At once, the phenomenon was 
shown as completely fantastic. 

He detected in the heart of the 
gravity field a tiny molecule com- 
plex. What was fantastic about it was 
that gravity was an invariable, solely 
dependent on mass and^ square of 
distance. 

Cemp had already calculated the 
gravity pull to be the equivalent of 
three times that of Earth at sea 
level. And so ... by all the laws of 
physics, that incredibly small particle 
must have an equivalent mass to 
three Earths! 

. Impossible, of course. 

It was by no means a complex of 
one of the large molecules, so far as 
Cemp could make out; and it was 
not radioactive. 

He was about to abandon his study 
of it, and to turn his attention to his 
own situation — ^when he noticed that 
the gravity field had an even more 
improbable quality. 

Its pull was limited to organic 
matter. It had no effect on the sur- 
rounding dirt walls, and in fact — ^his 
mind poised in a final amazement — 
the woman’s body was not influenced 
by it. 

The gravity was limited to one 
particular organic configuration — 
himself! 

One body, one human being only 
— Nat Cemp — was the sole object 
toward which it was oriented. 

He found himself remembering 
how he himself had been untouched 
by the field that had lifted A-Brem. 
He had sensed the presence of a 
field, but only by the way the mag- 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



17 




netic lines that passed through his 
head were affected by it. Even in 
his Silkie form — as he pursued the 
hurtling body of his alter ego — ^that 
and merely that had been true. 

This was for him; a personal grav- 
itational field; a small group of mol- 
ecules that “knew” him. 

As these events took place, and 
these flashing awarenesses came to 
him, Cemp turned his head and 
gazed back at the young woman. 

He was not surprised at what he 
saw. 

His attention had been forcibly 
removed from her; and so the pres- 
sure on the unconsciousness “valve” 
in her brain was released. She was 
stirring, coming to. 

S he sat up, looked around, and 
saw him. 

She came to her feet quickly, with 
an athletic ease. She evidently did 
not remember what had hanpened 
while she was unconscious, did not 
realize how completely she had given 
away basic secrets; for her face 
broke into a smile. 

“You see,” she said. “I told you 
what would happen. Well, good-by.” 
Her spirits visibly high, she turned 
and walked off into the cave, pres- 
ently disappeared as it gradually 
curved to the left. 

After she was gone, Cemp turned 
his attentioh back to the gravity field. 
He assumed that it would eventually 
be Withdrawn, or fade out, and he 
would be free. He had the distinct 
conviction that he might have only 
minutes in which to examine it and 
discover its nature. 

He thou^t unhappily: “If I could 



change into my Silkie form, I could 
really examine it.” 

But he dared not, could not. 

At least, he couldn’t and simul- 
taneously maintain his safe position. 

Silkies had one weakness, if it 
could be called that. They were vul- 
nerable when they changed from one 
form to another. 

Considering this, Cemp now con- 
ducted his first mental conversation 
with Joanne. He explained his pre- 
dicament, described ^hat he had 
learned, ended: “I think I can stay 
here all day and see what comes of 
this, but I should probably have an- 
other Silkie stand by for emergen- 
cies.” 

Her anxious reply was, “I’ll have 
Charley Baxter contact you.” 

IV 

S he phoned Baxter and passed the 
conversation on to Cemp in 
thought form. 

Baxter was enormously excited by 
the information that Cemp had ob- 
tained about the alien Silkies. He re- 
garded the gravity field as a new 
energy application, but was reluctant 
to send in another Silkie to help. 

“Let’s face it, Joanne,” he said. 
“Your husband learned something 
last year which, if other Silkies un- 
derstood it, might wreck the delicate 
balance by which we’re maintaining 
our present Silkie-human civilization. 
Nat understands our concern about 
that. So tell him I’ll send a machine 
in there to act as a barrier for him 
while he makes his changeover into 
Silkie.” 

It occurred to Cemp that the ap- 



is 



IF 




pearance of new, hitherto unknown 
Silkies would alter the Silkie-human, 
relationship even more. But he did 
not permit that thought to go out to 
Joanne. 

Baxter’s conversation concluded 
with the statement that it would 
probably take a while before the 
machine could be gotten to him. “So 
tell him to hold on.” 

After Baxter had hung up, Joanne 
thought at Cemp: “I should tell you 
that I’m relieved about one thing.” 

“What’s that?” 

“If the Silkie women are all as 
plain in human form as B-Roth then 
I’m not going to worry.” 

An hour went by. Two . Ten. 

In the world outside, the skies 
would be dark; the sun long gone; 
the stars signalling in their tiny bril- 
liant fashion. 

Charley Baxter’s machine had 
come and gone. And Cemp — safe 
in the Silkie form — remained close 
to the most remarkable energy field 
that had ever been seen in the solar 
system. What was astounding was 
that it showed no diminishment of 
the colossal gravity effect. His hope 
had been that with his super-sensi- 
tive Silkie perception he would be 
able to be aware of any feeder lines 
that might be. flowing power to it 
from an outside source. 

But there was nothing like that; 
nothing to trace. The power came 
from the single, small group of mol- 
ecules. It had no other origin. 

The minutes and the hours length- 
ened. The watch became long, and 
he had time to feel the emotional 
impact of the problem that now con- 
fronted every Silkie on Earth. 



The need to make a decision . • - 
about the Space Silkies. 

Morning. 

S hortly after the sun came up out- 
side, the field manifested an in- 
dependent quality. It began to move 
along the corridor, heading deeper 
into the cave. Cemp floated along 
after it, letting a portion of its grav- 
itational pull draw him. He was 
wary but curious, hopeful that now 
he would find out more. 

The cave ended abruptly in a 
deep sewer, which had the look of 
long abandonment. The concrete 
was cracked. There were innumer- 
able deep fissures in the walls. But 
to the group of molecules and their 
field, it seemed to be a familiar area, 
for they went forward more rapidly. 
Suddenly there was water below 
them. It was not stagnant, but rippled 
and swirled. A tidal pool, Cemp an- 
alyzed. 

The water grew deeper, and pres- 
ently they were in it, travelling at 
undiminishd speed. 

Ahead the murky depths grew 
less murky. They emerged into sun- 
lit waters in a canyon about a hun- 
dred feet below the surface of the 
ocean. 

As they broke surface a moment 
later, the strange energy complex ac- 
celerated. Cemp, suspecting that it 
would now try to get away from 
him, made a final effort to perceive 
its characteristics. 

But nothing came back to him. 
No message, no sign of energy flow. 
For a split instant, he did have the 
impression that the at6ms making 
up the molecule group were — some-

how — not right. But when he 
switched his attention to the band 
involved, the molecules must either 
have become aware of his momen- 
tary awareness and closed them- 
selves off — or he had imagined it. 

Even as he made the analysis, his 
feeling that he was about to be dis- 
carded was borne out. The particle’s 
speed increased rapidly. In seconds, 
its velocity approached the limits of 
what he could permit himself to en- 
dure inside an atmosphere. The outer 
chitin of his Silkie body grew hot, 
then hotter. 

Reluctantly Ccmp adjusted his 
own atomic structure, so that the 
gravity of the alien field no longer 
affected him. As he fell away, it 
continued to pursue a course which 
took it in an easterly direction, where 
the sun was now an hour above the 
horizon. Within mere seconds of his 
separation from it, it left the at- 
mosphere and, traveling at many 
miles a second, headed seemingly 
straight for the sun. 

Cemp came to the atmosphere’s 
edge. “Gazing” by means of his Sil- 
kie perceptors out upon the vast, 
dark ocean of space beyond, he con- 
tacted the nearest telstar unit. To the 
scientists aboard, he gave a fix on 
the speeding molecule group. Then 
he waited hopefully while they tried 
to put a tracer on it. 

But the* word finally came: “Sor- 
ry, we get no reaction.” 

Baffled, Cemp let himself be 
drawn by Earth’s gravity. Then, by a 
series of controlled adjustments to 
both the magnetic and gravity fields 
of the planet, he guided himself to 
the Silkie Authority. 



hree hours of talk — 

Cemp who, as the only Silkie 
present, occupied a seat near the 
foot of the long table, found the 
discussion boring. 

It had early seemed to him that 
he, or some other Silkie, ought to be 
sent to the Silkie planetoid to learn 
the facts, handle the matter in a 
strictly logical but humanitarian 
fashion, and report back to the 
Authority. 

If, for some reason, the so-called 
Silkie Nation proved to be unam- 
enable to reason, then a further dis- 
cussion would be in order. 

As he waited for the three dozen 
human conferees to reach the same 
decision, he couldn’t help but notice 
the order of importance at the table. 

The Special People — ^which in- 
cluded Charley Baxter — ^were at the 
head of the long table. Next, rang- 
ing down on either side were the or- 
dinary human beings. Then, on one 
side, himself, and below him, three 
minor aides and the official secretary 
of the three-man Silkie Authority. 

It was not a new observation for 
him. He had discussed it with other 
Silkies and had had it pointed out to 
him that here was a reversal of the 
power role that was new in history. 

The strongest individuals in the 
solar system — the Silkies — still were 
relegated to secondary status. 

He emerged from his reverie to 
the realization that silence had fallen. 
And that Charley Baxter, slim, 
gray-eyed, intense, was coming 
around the long table. He stopped 
across from Cemp. 




20 



IF 




“Well, Nat,” said Baxter, “there’s 
the picture as we see it” He seemed 
embarrassed. 

Cemp did a lightning mental back- 
track on the discussion. And realized 
that they had indeed arrived at the 
inevitable conclusion. 

But he noted also that they con- 
sidered it a weighty decision. Tt was a 
lot to ask of any person, that was the 
attitude. The result could be person- 
al disaster. They wouldn’t be critical 
if he refused. 

“I feel ashamed to ask it,” said 
Baxter, “but this is almost a war sit- 
uation.” 

Cemp could see that they were not 
sure of themselves. There had been 
no war on Earth for 150 years. No- 
bodv was an expert in it any more. 

He climbed to his feet as these 
awarenesses touched him. Now, he 
looked around at the faces turned to 
him, and he said, “Calm yourselves, 
gentlemen. Naturally I’ll do it.” 

They all looked relieved. The dis- 
cussion turned quickly to details: the 
difficulty of locating a single meteor- 
ite in space; particularly one which 
had such a long sidereal period. 

I t was well known that there were 
about fifteen hundred large 
meteorites and planetoids, and tens 
of thousands of smaller objects. All 
of these had orbits or motions 
which, though subject to the laws of 
celestial mechanics, were often very 
eccentric in their movements. A few 
of them, like comets, periodically 
came in close to the sun, then shot 
off into space again, returning few 
another hectic go-round fifty to a 
hundred years later. Tliere were so 



many of these intermediate sized 
rocks that they were identified and 
their courses plotted only for special 
reasons. There simply had never been 
any point in tracking them all. 

Cemp had matched course with 
and landed on scores of lone meteor- 
ites. His recollections of those ex- 
periences were among the bleaker 
memories of his numerous space 
flights. The darkness, the sense of 
utterly barren rock, the profound 
lack of sensory stimulation. Oddly, 
the larger they were, the worse the 
feeling. 

He had discovered that he could 
have a kind of intellectual affinity 
with a rock that was less than a 
thousand feet in diameter. Particu- 
larly was this true of an inarticulate 
mass that had finally been precipi- 
tated into a hyperbolic orbit. When 
he computed that it was thus destined 
to leave the solar system forever, he 
would find himself imagining how 
long it had been in space, how far 
it had gone and how it would now 
hurtle away from the solar system 
and spend eons between the stars. 

A government representative — a 
human being named John Mathews 
— interrupted his thought: 

“Mr. Cemp, Fd like to ask you a 
very personal question.” 

Cemp looked at him and nodded. 
The man went on, “According to 
reports, several hundred Earth Silk- 
ies have already defected to diese na- 
tive Silkies. Evidently you don’t feel, 
as they do, that the Silkie planetoid 
is home. Why not?” 

Cemp smiled. “Well, first of all,” 
he said, “I would never buy a pig 
in a poke the way they have done.”

He hesiiatcd. Then in a serious 
tone he continued: “Entirely apart 
from my feelings of loyalty to Earth, 
I do not believe the future of life 
forms will be helped or advanced by 
any rigid adherence to the idea that 
I am a lion, or I am a bear. Intel- 
ligent life is, or should be, moving 
toward a common civilization. May- 
be I’m like Che farm boy who went to 
die bdg dty — Earth. Now my folks 
want me to come back to the farm. 
TheyH never understand why I 
can’t, so I don’t even try to explain 
It- 

-Maybe,- said Mathews, “the 
planetoid is actually the big city and 
earth Che farm. What then?” 

Cemp smiled politely, but merely 
shook hb head. 

Mathews persisted: “One more 
question. How should Silkies be 
treated?- 

Cemp sjmad his hands. “I can’t 
think of a single change of value.- 

H e meant it. He had never been 
able Co get excited about the 
pecking order. 

Yet he had known for a long time 
that some Silkies felt strongly about 
their inferior — as it seemed to 
them — ^role. Others, like himself, did 
their duty, were faithful to their hu- 
man wives and tried to enjoy the 
somewhat limited possibilities of hu- 
man civilization — ^limited for Silkies, 
who^ had so many additional senses 
for which there was no organized 
creative stimulation. 

Presumably things could be better. 
But meanwhile they were what they 
were. Cemp recognized that any at- 
tempt to alter them would cause 



fear and disturbance among human 
beings. And why do that merely to 
satisfy the egos of somewhat less 
than two thousand Silkies? 

At least, that had been the prob- 
lem until now. The coming of the 
Space Silkies would add an indefin- 
ite number of new egos to the 
scene. Yet, Cemp reasoned, not 
enou^ to change the statistics mean- 
ingfully. 

Aioud he said, “As far as I can 
see, under all conceivable circum- 
stances, there is no better solution 
to the Silkie problem than that 
which exists right now\” 

Charley Baxter chose that mo- 
ment to end the discussion, saying, 
“Nat, you have our best, our very 
best wishes. And our complete con- 
fidence. A spaceship will rush you 
to Mercury’s orbit and give you a 
head start. Good luck.- 

VI 

T he scene ahead was absolutely 
fantastic. 

The Silkie planetoid would make 
its circuit of the sun far inside Mer- 
cury’s eccentric orbit, and the ap- 
pearance was that it might brush the 
edges of the great clouds of hot gas 
that seemed to poke out like stream- 
ers — or shapeless arms — from the 
sun’s hot surface. 

Cemp doubted if such a calamity 
would actually occur, but as he per- 
iodically subjected his steel-hard, 
chitinous Silkie body to the sun’s 
gravity, he sensed the enormous pull 
of it at this near distance. 

The circle of white fire filled al- 
most the entire sky ahead. The light 



22 



IF 




was so intense, and came in on him 
on so many bands, that it over- 
whelmed his receptor system, when- 
ever he let it in. And he had to 
open up at intervals in order to make 
readjustments in his course. 

The two hurtling bodies — his own 
and that of planetoid — were pres- 
ently on a collision course. 

The actual moment of “collision” 
was still hours away. So Cemp shut 
off his entire perception system. 
Thus instantly he sank into the deep 
sleep which Silkies so rarely allowed 
themselves. 

He awoke in stages and saw that 
his timing had been exact. The plan- 
etoid now was “visible” on one of 
the tiny neural screens inside the 
forward part of his body. It showed 
as a radar-type image; and at the 
beginning it was the size of a pea. 

In less than thirty minutes it grew 
to an apparent size of five miles — 
which was half its diameter, he esti- 
mated. 

At this point, Cemp performed his 
only dangerous maneuver. He al- 
lowed the sun’s gravity to draw him 
between the sun and the planetoid. 
Then he cut off the sun’s gravity, 
and, using a few bursts of energy — 
manufactured at the edge of a field 
behind his body — darted toward the 
planetoid’s surface. 

What was dangerous about this 
action was that it brought him in on 
the day side. With the super brilliant 
sunlight behind him, he was clearly 
visible to anyone in or on or around 
the planetoid. 

But his theory was that no Silkie 
would normally be exposing himself 
to the sun; and that in fact every 



sensible Silkie would be inside the 
big stone ball or on its night side. 

At close range In that ultra-bright 
light, the planetoid looked like the 
wrinkled head and face of a bald, 
old Indian. It was reddish-gray in 
color, and pock-marked and lined, 
and not quite round. The pock marks 
turned out to be actual caves. Into 
one of these, Cemp floated. 

C emp went down into what to his 
human eyes would have been 
pitch darkness; but, as a Silkie the 
interior was visible to him on many 
bands. 

He found himself in a corridor 
with smooth, granite walls that led 
slantingly downward. After about 
twenty minutes he came to a turn in 
the passageway. As he rounded it, he 
saw a shimmering, almost opaque 
energy screen in front of him. 

Cemp decided at once not to re- 
gard it as a problem. He doubted if 
it had been put up to catch anyone. 
In fact, his lightning analysis of it 
indicated that it was a wall, with the 
equivalent solidity of a large space- 
ship’s outer skin. 

As a screen it was strong enough 
to keep out the most massive armor- 
piercing shells. 

Going through such a screen was 
an exercise in Silkie energy control. 

First he put up a matching field, 
and started it oscillating. The oscil- 
lation unstabilized the opposing 
screen and started it in a sympathetic 
vibration. As the process continued 
the screen and the field began to 
merge. But it was the screen that be- 
came part of Cemp’s field; not the 
reverse. 



SILKIES IN SPACE

Thus, his field was within minutes 
a part of the barrier. Safely inside it, 
he crossed the barrier space. Once 
past it, disengagement was a matter 
of slowing down the oscillation until 
the field and the screen abruptly be- 
came separate entities. 

The sound of the separation was 
like the crack of a whip. 

And the fact that there was sound 
indicated he had come into air space. 
Quickly, he discovered that it was 
air of an unearthly mixture. 30% 
oxygen, 20% helium, and most of 
the rest, gaseous sulphur compounds. 

The pressure was about twice that 
of sea level on Earth. 

But it was air, and it undoubtedly 
had a purpose. 

From where he had floated 
through the energy barrier, he saw a 
large chamber, the floor of which 
was about a hundred feet below him. 

Soft lights shone down. 

Seen in that light, the room was 
a iewel. 

The walls were inlaid with pre- 
cious stones, fine metals and vari- 
colored rock, cunningly cut into a 
design. The design was a continuing 
story picture of a race of four-legged, 
centaur-type beings, with a proud 
bearing and — ^wherever there were 
close-ups — sensitive though unhuman 
faces. 

On the floor was a picture of a 
planet inset in some kind of glowing 
substance that showed the curving, 
mountainous surface, with sparkling 
lines where rivers flowed, three-di- 
mensional appearance of trees and 
other growth, glinting oceans and 
lakes, and thousands of bright spots 
marking cities and towns. 



The sides of the planet curved 
away in proper proportion, and 
Cemp had the feeling that the globe 
continued on down and the bot- 
tom was probably visible in some 
lower room. 

The over-all effect was complete- 
ly end totally beautiful. 

C emp surmised that the life scenes 
and the planet picture were 
an accurate eidolon of a race and a 
place with which the Silkies had at 
some time in their past been asso- 
ciated. 

He was mentally staggered by the 
artistic perfection of the room. 

He had already, as he floated 
down, noticed that there were large 
archways leading to adjoining cham- 
bers. He had glimpses of furniture, 
machines, objects, shining bright and 
new. He surmised they were arti- 
facts of either the centaur or other 
civilizations. But he could not take 
time to explore. His attention fas- 
tened on a stairway that led down 
to the next level. 

He went down it, and presently 
found himself facing another energy 
barrier. 

Penetrating it exactly as he had the 
other, he moved on and into a cham- 
ber filled with sea water. 

Inset in the floor of that huge 
room was a planet that glimmered 
with the green-blue of an undersea 
civilization. 

And that was only the beginning. 
Cemp went down from one level to 
another, each time through an en- 
ergy screen, and through similarly 
decorated chambers. 

Each was inlaid in the same way 

IF 



24 




with precious stones and glinting 
metals. Each had hreathtalcmg scenes 
from what he presumed were habit- 
able planets of fad* stars, and a dif- 
ferent atmosphere. 

After a dozen, the impact began 
to be cumulative. Realization came 
that here, inside this planetoid, had 
been gathered such treasure as prob- 
ably did not exist anywhere else. 
Cemp visualized the 700-odd cubic 
miles that comprised the interior of 
the most fantastic asteroid in the 
galaxy; and he remembered what 
Mathews had said. The human gov- 
ernment official had speculated that 
perhaps the planetoid was the “city** 
and Earth was the “farm”. 

It began to seem more true. 

He had been expecting momen- 
tarily to collide with an inhabitant 
of the planetoid. After passing three 
more of the chambers, each with its 
glowing duplicate in miniature of a 
planet of long ago and far away, 
Cemp paused and re-considered. 

He had a strong feeling that in 
learning of these treasures, he had 
gained an advantage — which he must 
not lose — and that the Silkies did in- 
deed have their living quarters on the 
side away from the sun, and that 
they did not expect anyone to arrive 
in this surprise' fashion. 

The idea continued to seem cor- 
rect, and so he turned back and was 
presently dropping directly toward 
the dark side. 

A gain the cave openings. And a 
few score feet inside, the ener- 
gy barrier. Beyond that was air and 
gravitation exactly as at sea level on 
die Earth. 



Cemp floated down into a smooth- 
ly polished granite chamber. It was 
ifomished with settees, chairs and 
tables, and there was a long, low- 
built bookcase at one end. But the 
arrangement was as in an anteroom; 
formal and unlived in. It gave him 
an eerie feeling. 

Still in his Silkie form, he went 
down a staircase and into another 
chamber. It had soil in it, and there 
was vegetation, which consisted of 
temperate zone Earth shrubs and 
flowers. Once more, the arrangement 
was formal. 

On the third level down were 
earth-like offices, with information 
computers. Cemp, who understood 
such matters, recorded what they 
were. He observed also that no one 
was using this particular source of 
data. 

He was about to go down to the 
next level — when an en^gy beam of 
enormous power triggered the super- 
fast defense screen he had learned 
from the Kibmadinc the previous 
year. 

The coruscation as the beam in- 
twacted with an ever vaster inten- 
sity with Cemp’s barrier screen lit 
the chamber as if sunlight had sud- 
denly been let in. It stayed lit as 
whoever directed the beam tested 
the screen’s durability in a sustained 
power thrust. 

For Cemp, it was a fight that 
moved at lightning speed down the 
entire line of his defenses, and came 
finally up against the hard core of 
the second method he had learned 
from the Kibmadine. 

There, and only there, he held his 
own. 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



25 





A minute went by before the at- 
tacker seemed finally to accept 
that Cemp simply used the beam it- 
self to maintain the barrier. Hence, 
it took nothing out of him, and it 
would last as long as the beam — and 
re-form as often as necessary. 

As suddenly as it had begun, the 
attacking energy ceased. 

Cemp stared around him, dis- 
mayed. The entire chamber was a 
shambles of twisted, white-hot ma- 
chinery and debris. The granite walls 
had crumbled, exposing raw meteor- 
ite rock behind it. Molten rock 
dripped in a score of flowing rivers 
from the shattered ceiling and walls. 
Great sections were still tumbling 
and sliding. 

What had been a modern office 





had become in a matter of minutes 
a gutted desolation of blackened 
metal and rock. 

For Cemp, the initial staggering 
reality was that only the high speed 
Kibmadine screen had saved him. 
The assault had been gauged to over- 
whelm and over-speed the entire 
Silkie defense and attack system. 

The intent had been death. 

No bargmning, no discussion, no 
questions. 

The hard fight had driven him 
down to a special logic of levels. He 
felt an automatic outflow of hatred. 

Yet, after a little, another realiza- 
tion penetrated: ‘T won!” he 

thought. 

Calm again but savage, he went 
down five more levels; emerged ab- 
ruptly at the upper level of a great 
vista, a huge open space. 



The city of the Silkies spread be- 
low him. 

It was precisely and exactly like 
a small Earth city. Apartment build- 
ings. Private residences. Tree-lined 
streets. Cemp was bemused; for here 
also the native Silkies had clearly at- 
tempted to create a human atmos- 
phere. 

He could make out ’figures on a 
sidewalk far below. He started down. 

When he was a hundred feet above 
them, the people stopped and looked 
up at him. One — a woman — directed 
a startled thought at him: “Who are 
you?” 

Cemp told her. 

The reaction of the four nearest 
people was astonishment. But they 
were not afraid, or hostile. 

The little group — three women 
and one man — waited for him. As 
Cemp came down, he was aware that 
they were signalling to others. Soon 
a crowd had gathered, mostly in 
human bodies, mostly women, but an 
even dozen arrived in the Silkie 
form. 

Guards? he wondered. But they 
were not antagonistic either. 

Everybody was mentally open; and 
what was disconcerting about that 
was, no one showed awareness of the 
attack that had been made on him in 
the office section near the surface. 

Instantly, he saw their unaware- 
ness as an opportunity. By keeping 
silent and alert, he would be able 
to spot his vicious assailant. 

He presumed the violence had 
been planned and carried out at the 
administrative level. 

“ni find those so-and-so’s!” he 
thought grimly.

'Tk) his audience of innocent cit- 
A izens, he said, ‘Tm acting as an 
emissary of the Earth Government. 
My purpose here is to discover what 
binding agreements are possible.” 

A woman called up to him, “We 
can’t seem to change into attractive 
females, Earth style. What do you 
suggest?” 

A gale of laughter greeted her re- 
mark. Cemp was taken aback. He 
hadn’t expected such easy friendli- 
ness from the crowd. 

But his determination did not 
waver. “I presume we can discuss 
that also at government level,” he 
said, “but it won’t be first on the 
agenda.” 

Some remnants of his hate flow 
must have gone out to them with 
his thought, for a man said sharply, 
“He doesn’t sound very friendly.” 

A woman added quickly: “Come 
now, Mr. Cemp. This is your real 
home.” 

Cemp had recovered. He replied; 
a steady level thought: “You’il get 
what you give. Right now, you’re 
giving good. But the agents your 
government sent to Earth made 
blood-thirsty threats.” 

His thought paused there, puzzled. 
For these people as diey were right 
now, did not seem to have any of 
that threat in them. It struck him 
that that should he very significant. 

After a moment’s hesitation, he 
finished: " 

“I’m here to discover what it’s all 
about, so why not direct me to some- 
one in authority?” 

“We don’t have authorities.” That 
was a woman. 

A man said, “Mr. Cemp, we live 



a completely free existence here and 
you and other Earth Silkies are in- 
vited to join us.” 

Cemp persisted, “Who decided to 
send those four hundred messengers 
to Earth?” 

“We always do that, when the 
time comes,” another woman replied. 

“Complete with threats?” asked 
Cemp. “Threats of death?” 

She seemed suddenly uncertain. 
She turned to one of the men. “You 
were down there,” she said.' “Did 
you imply violence?” 

The man hesitated. “It’s a little 
vague,” he said. “But I guess so.” 
He added quickly, “It’s always been 
this way when E-Lerd conditions us 
in connection with the Power. Mem- 
ory tends to fade very quickly. In 
fact, I hadn’t recalled that threat as- 
pect until now.” He seemed aston- 
ished. “I’ll be damned. I think we 
had better speak to E-Lerd and find 
the reason for it.” 

C emp telepathed directly to the 
man. “What was your after 
feeling about what you had done?” 
“Just that I communicated that 
we Space Silkies were here, and that 
it was time for the Earth Silkies to 
become aware of their true origin.” 
He broke off, turned to the others. 
“This is fantastic,” he said. “I’m 
astounded. We need to look into E- 
Lerd’s administration of the Power. 
I uttered murderous words when I 
was on Earth! That’s not like me at 
all.” 

His complete amazement was 
more convincing than anything else 
could possibly have been. 

Cemp said firmly, “I gather then 



28 



IF 




that, contrary to your earlier state- 
ments, you do have a leader, and 
his name is E-Lerd.” 

One of the Silkie bodies answered 
that. “No, he’s not a leader, but I 
can see how that might be under- 
stood. We’re free. No one tells us 
what to do. But we do delegate re- 
sponsibilities. For example, E-Lerd 
is in charge of the Power, and we 
get its use through him. Would you 
like to talk to him, Mr. Cemp?” 
“Indeed I would,” said Cemp with 
immense satisfaction. 

He was thinking: “The Power! Of 
course. Who else? The person who 
has control of the Power is the only 
one who could have attacked me!” 
“My name is O-Vedd,” said the 
Space Silkie. “Come with me.” 
His long, bullet-like body detached 
itself from the group of similar 
bodies and darted off over the heads 
of the crowd. Cemp followed. They 
came down to a small entrance that 
led along a narrow, smooth-walled, 
granite corridor. After a hundred 
feet this opened out to another huge 
space. Here was a second city. 

At least, for a moment that was 
what it looked like. 

Then Cemp saw that the buildings 
were of a different character. Not 
dwellings at all. For him, who was 
familiar with most of the parapher- 
nalia of manufactured energy, there 
was no question. Some of the mas- 
sive structures below were the kind 
that housed atomic power. Others 
were distributing plants for electric- 
ity. Still others had the unmistakable 
shape of the Ylem transformation 
systems. 

None of these, of course, was the 



Power. But here indeed was power in 
abundance. 

Cemp followed O-Vedd down to 
the courtyard of a building complex 
that, despite all its shields, he had 
no difficulty in identifying as a 
source of magnetic beams. 

The Space Silkie landed and^trans- 
formed to human, then stood and 
waited for Cemp to do likewise. 

“Nothing doing!” said Cemp, curt- 
ly. “Ask him to come out here.” 

O-Vedd shrugged. As a human, 
he was short and dark. He walked 
off and vanished into a doorway. 

C emp waited amid a silence that 
was broken only by the faint 
hum of power from the buildings. 
A breeze touched the super-sensi- 
tive spy-ray extensions that he main- 
tained in operation under all circum- 
stances. The little wind registered 
through the spy mechanisms, but did 
not trigger the defense screens be- 
hind them. 

It was only a breeze, after all; 
and he had never programmed him- 
self to respond to sudi minor sig- 
nals. 

He was about to dismiss it from 
his mind; about to contemplate his 
reaction to the Space Silkies — he 
liked the crowd he had seen — when 
he thought, sharply; A breeze here! 

Up went his screen. Out project- 
ed his perceptors. 

He had time to notice, then, that 
it was indeed a breeze but that it 
was being stirred by a blankness in 
the surrounding space. 

Around Cemp, the courtyard grew 
hazy; then it faded. 

There was no planetoid. 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



29 




C emp increased all signal sensitiv- 
ity to maximum. 

He continued to float in the 
vacuum of space, and off to one side 
was the colossal white circle that 
was the sun. 

Cemp felt a sudden energy drain 
from his body. The sensation was of 
his Silkie screens going up, of his 
system resisting outside energy at 
many levels. 

He thought in a tense dismay: 
“I’m in a fight. It’s another attempt 
to kill me.** 

Whatever it was, it was automatic. 
His own perception remained cut 
off, and he was impelled to experi- 
ence what the attacker wanted him 
to. 

Cemp felt himself, then, like a 
man suddenly set upon in pitch dark- 
ness. But what was appalling about 
it was that his senses were being held 
by other forces, preventing aware- 
ness of the nature of the attack. 
What he saw was — 

Distance disappeared! 

There, spread over many miles of 
space, was a group of Silkies. Cemp 
saw them clearly, counted in his 
lightning fashion two hundred and 
eighty-eight, caught their thoughts, 
and recognized that these were the 
renegade Silkies from Earth. 

Suddenly, he understood that they 
had been told where the Silkie plan- 
etoid was, and they were on their 
way “home**. 

Time was telescoped. 

The entire group of Silkies was 
transported in what seemed an in- 
stant to within a short distance of 
the planetoid. Cemp could see the 
planetoid in the near distance — 



only a few miles away, twenty at 
the maximum. 

But to him the baffling, deadly, 
fantastic thing was that, as these 
marvellous events ran their course 
at one level of his perception, at an- 
other level the feeling remained that 
a determined attempt was being made 
to kill him. 

He could see, feel, be aware of 
almost nothing. 

But throughout, the shadowy sen- 
sations continued. His energy fields 
were going through defensive mo- 
tions. But it was all far away from 
his awareness, like a human dream. 

Being a fully trained Silkie, Cemp 
watched the internal as well as the 
external developments with keen ob- 
servation. Strove instant by instant to 
grasp the reality. Monitored incom- 
ing signals by the thousands. 

He began to sense meaning. Began 
to have initial speculations about the 
nature of the physical-world pheno- 
menon involv^. And he had the 
feeling of being on the verge of his 
first computation when — as sud- 
denly as it had begun — it ended. 

The space scene began to fade. 
Abruptly, it winked out. 

He was back in the courtyard of 
the buildings that housed the mag- 
netic power complex. 

Coming toward him from the open 
doorway of the main building was 
0-Vedd. He was accompanied by a 
man who was of Cemp’s general 
human build: over six feet, strongly 
muscled; his face was heavier than 
Cemp’s, and his eyes brown instead 
of gray. 

As he came near, he said, “I am 
E-Lerd. Let’s talk.** 



30 



IF 




vm 

E -Lerd continued: *To begin with, 
I want to tell you the history of 
die Silkies.” 

Cemp, who was braced for a bitter 
quarrel, who could feel in himself a 
multitude of re-adjusting energy 
flows . proof of the severity of the 
second all-out fight he had been in 
— for which he absolutely required 
a complete explanation — was elec- 
trified by the statement. 

At that moment, caught up as he 
was in a steely rage, nothing else 
could have diverted his attention. 
But — 

The history of the Silkies! To 
Cemp, it was instantly the most im- 
portant subject in the universe. 

The Silkie planetoid, E-Lerd be- 
gan, had entered the solar system 
from outer space nearly three hun- 
dred years before. It had, in due 
course, been drawn into a Sol-Nep- 
tfunian orbit. 

On its first encirclement of the 
sun. Silkies visited the inner planets 
and found that Earth alone was in- 
habited. 

Since they could change form, 
they studied the biologic structure 
necessary to function in the two at- 
mospheres of Earth — air and water 
— and set up an internal program- 
ming for that purpose. 

Unfortunately, a small percentage 
of the human population — it was 
soon discovered — could tune in on 
the thoughts of Silkies. 

All those who did so in this first 
visit were quickly hunted down and 
their memories of the experience 
blotted out. 



But, because of these sensitive hu- 
mans, it became necessary for Silk- 
ies to seem to be the product of 
human biologic experiment. An inter- 
relationship with human females was 
accordingly programmed into Silk- 
ies, so that the human female ovum 
and the male Silkie sperm- would 
produce a Silkie who knew nothing 
of Silkie history. 

In order to maintain this process 
on an automatic level, the Special 
People — those persons who could 
read Silkie minds — were maneuv- 
ered into being in charge of it. 

Thereupon, all adult Silkies return- 
ed to their planetoid, which now 
went to the remote end of its orbit. 
When it came again into the vicinity 
of Earth more than a hundred years 
later, cautious visits were made. 

It became apparent that several 
unplanned things had happened. 

Human biologists had experiment- 
ed with the process. As a result, in 
the early stages, variants had been 
bom. TTiese had propagated their 
twisted traits and were continuing to 
do so, growing ever more numerous. 

The actual consequences were: 

— A number of true Silkies, cap- 
able of making the three-fold trans- 
formation at will. 

— Class B Silkies, who could 
transform from human to fish state, 
but with no ability to become space 
people. They were a stable form. 

— Variants! 

These latter two groups had large- 
ly taken to the oceans. Accordingly 
it was decided to leave the Class B 
Silkies alone, but that an effort be 
made to inveigle the Variants into 
gigantic spaceships filled with water, 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



31 




where — thus conscenh-ated — they 

would be isolated and prevented 
from interbreeding. 

This plan was already under way 
by the time the Silkie planetoid made 
its round of the sim and again head- 
ed out toward far Neptune. 

N ow they were back. And they 
had found an unfortunate sit- 
uation. 

Somehow, Earth science — virtu- 
ally ignored by the early visitors — 
had achieved a training miracle for 
the Silkie perception system. 

The Earth Silkies had become a 
loyal-to-Earth, tight-knit, masterful 
group of beings, lacking only the 
Power. 

Cemp “read** all this in E-Lerd’s 
thought; and then, because he was 
amazed, he questioned him about 
what seemed a major omission in his 
story. 

\^erc had tiic Silkie planetoid 
come from? 

E-Lerd showed his first impa- 
tience, 

“Tliesc joumeys arc too far,** he 
telepathed. “They take too long. No- 
body remembers origins. Some other 
star system, enviously .” 

“Are you serious?” Cemp was 
astounded. “You don’t know?” 

But that was the story. Pry at it 
as he might, it did not change. Al- 
though E-Lerd’s mind remained clos- 
ed, except for his telepathed thoughts, 
0-Vedd’s mind was open. In it Cemp 
saw the same beliefs and the same 
lack of information. 

But why the tampering with hu- 
man biology, and the intermixing of 
the two breeds? 

32 



“We always do that. That’s how 
we live — in a relationship with the 
inhabitants of a system.” 

“How do you know you always do 
that? You just told me you can’t re- 
member where you came from this 
time or where you were before that.” 
“Well — it’s obvious from the arti- 
facts we brought along.” 

E-Lerd’s attitude dismissed his 
questions as being irrelevant. Cemp 
detected a mind phenomenon in the 
other that explained the attitude. To 
Space Silkies, the past was unimpor- 
tant. Silkies always did certain things, 
because that was the way they were 
mentally, emotionally, and physically 
constructed. 

A Silkie didn’t have to know from 
past experience. He (or she) simply 
had to be what was innate in Silkies. 

It was, Cemp realized, a basic ex- 
planation for much that he had ob- 
served. This was why these Silkies 
had never been trained scientifically. 
Training was an alien concept in the 
cosmos of the Space Silkies. 

“You mean,” he protested, in- 
credulous, “you have no idea why 
you left the last system where you 
had this inter-relationship with the 
race there? Why not stay forever in 
some system where you have located 
yourself?” 

“Probably,” said E-Lerd, “some- 
body got too close to the secret of 
the Power. That could not be per- 
mitted.” 

^T^hat was the reason — he con- 
A tinned — why Cemp and other 
Silkies had to come back into the 
fold. As Silkies, they might learn 
about the Power. 



IF 




The discussion had come naturally 
around to that urgent subject. 

“What,” said Cemp, “is the Pow- 
er?” 

E-Lerd stated formally that that 
was a forbidden subject. 

“Then I shall have to force the 
secret from you,” said Cemp. “There 
can be no agreement without it.” 

E-Lerd replied stiffly that any at- 
tempt at enforcement would require 
him to use the Power as a defense. 

Cemp lost patience. 

“After your two attempts to kill 
me,” he telcpathed in a steely rage, 
“I’ll give you thirty seconds — ” 

“What attempts to kill you?” said 
E-Lerd, surprised. 

At that precise moment, as Cemp 
was bracing himself to use logic of 
levels . there was an interruption. 

An “impulse” band — a very Idw, 
slow vibration — touched one of the 
receptors in the forward part of his 
brain. It operated at mere multiples 
of the audible sound range directly 
on his sound receiving system. 

What was new was that the sound 
acted as a carrier for the accompany- 
ing thought. The result was as if a 
voice spoke clear and loud into his 
ears. 

“You win,” said the voice. “You 
have forced me. I shall talk to you 
myself — by-passing my unknowing 
servants,** 

DC 

C emp identified the incoming 
thought formation as a direct 
contact. Accordingly, his brain — 
which was programmed to respond 
instantaneously to a multitude of sig- 



nals — was triggered to instant ef- 
fort to suction more impulses from 
the sending brain. 

. And he got a picture. A mo- 
mentary glimpse. So brief that even 
after a few seconds it was hard to 
be sure that it was real and not a 
figment of fantasy. 

Something huge lay in the^ dark- 
ness deep inside the planetoid. Lay 
there and gave forth with an impres- 
sion of vast power. It had been with- 
holding itself, watching him with 
some tiny portion of itself. The larg- 
er whole understood the universe 
and could manipulate massive sec- 
tions of space-time. 

“Say nothing to these others.” 
Again the statement was a direct 
contact thought which sounded like 
spoken words. 

The dismay that had seized on 
Cemp in the few moments that had 
now gone by was on the level of 
desperation. 

He had entered the SiHde strong- 
hold in the belief that his human 
training and Kibmadine knowledge 
gave him a temporary advantage 
over the Space Silkies, and that — if 
he did not delay — he could force 
a decision that might resolve the 
entire threat from these natural 
Silkies. 

Instead, he had come unsuspecting 
into the lair of a cosmic giant. 

He thought, appalled, “Here is 
what has been called ‘the Power*.” 

And if the glimpse he had had was 
real, then it was such a colossal 
power that all his own idality and 
strength were as nothing. 

He deduced now that this was 
what had attacked him twice. “Is 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



33 




tliat true?** he telepathed on the 
same band as the incoming thoughts 
had been on. 

“Yes, I admit it.“ 

“Why?** Cemp flashed the ques- 
tion, “did you do it?” 

“So that I would not have to re- 
veal my existence. My fear is always 
that, if other life forms find out 
about me, they will analyze how to 
destroy me.” 

The direction of the alien thought 
altered: “But now, listen; do as fol- 
lows — ” 

T he confession had again stirred 
Cemp’s emotions. 

Because the hatred that had been 
aroused in him had the sustained 
force that derived from the Logic of 
Levels stimulation — in this instance 
the body's response to an attempt at 
total destruction — he had difficulty 
DOW restraining additional automatic 
reactions. 

But the pieces of the puzzle were 
falling into place. And so, presently, 
he was able, at the request of the 
monster, to say to E-Lerd and the 
Other Silkie: 

‘Take a while to think this over. 
And when the Silkies who have de- 
fected arrive from Earth, Fll talk to 
them. We can then have another 
discussion.” 

It was such a complete change of 
attitude that the two Silkies were 
surprised. 

But he saw that to them the 
change had the look of weakness, 
and they were relieved. 

“Fll ^ back here in one hour!” 
Cemp telepathed to E-Lerd. 

Whereupon he turned and climbed 



up and out of the courtyard, darting 
to an opening that led by a round- 
about route deeper into the planetoid. 

Again the low, slow vibration 
touched his receptors. “Come clos- 
er!” the creature urged. 

Cemp obeyed, on the hard-core 
principle that he either could de- 
fend himself — or he couldn’t. Down 
he went, past a dozen screens, to a 
barren cave, a chamber that had 
been carved out of the original 
meteorite stuff. It was not even light- 
ed. As he entered, the direct thought 
touched his mind again: “Now we 
can talk.” 

Cemp hr>d been tV» inking at furious 
speed; striving to adjust to a danger 
so fantastic that he had no way of 
evaluating it. 

Yet ‘the Power’ had revealed itself 
to him rather than let E-Lerd find 
out anything. That seemed to be his 
one hold on it; and he had the tense 
conviction that even that was true 
only so long as he was inside the 
planetoid. 

He thought: “. Take full ad- 
vantage.” 

He telepathed: “After those at- 
tacks, you’ll have to give me some 
straight answers, if you expect to deal 
with me.” 

“What do you want to know?” 

“Who are you? Where do you 
come from. What do you want?” 

It didn’t know who it was. 

“I have a name,” it said. “I am a 
Glis. There used to be many like me 
long ago. I don’t know what hap- 
pened to them.” 

“But what are you?” 

It had no knowledge. An energy 
life form of unknown origin, travel- 



34 



IP 




ing from one star system to another, 
remaining for a while, then leaving. 

“But why leave? Why not stay?” 
Sharply. 

“The time comes when I have 
done what I can for a particular 
system.” 

... By using its enormous power, 
it transported large ice and air me- 
teorites to airless planets and made 
them habitable; cleared away dan- 
gerous space debris, altered poison- 
ous atmospheres into non-poisonous 
ones . 

“Presently the job is done, and I 
realize it’s time to go on to explore 
the infinite cosmos. So I make my 
pretty picture of the inhabited plan- 
ets, as you saw, and head for outer 
space.” 

“And the Silkies?” 

They were an old meteorite life 
form. 

“I found them long ago, and be- 
cause I needed mobile units that 
could think, I persuaded them into 
a permanent relationship.” 

Cemp did not ask what persuasive 
methods had been used. In view of 
the ignorance of the Silkies of what 
they had a relationship with, he di- 
vined that a sly method had been 
used. But still, what he had seen 
showed an outwardly peaceful ar- 
rangement. The Glis has agents — 
the Silkies — who acted for it in the 
world of tiny movements. They, in 
turn, had at their disposal bits and 
pieces of the Glis’s own “body”, 
which apparently could be program- 
med for specific tasks beyond their 
ability to perform. 

“I am willing,” said the Glis, “to 
make the same arrangement with 



your government fcH* as long as I 
remain in the solar system.” 

But absolute secrecy would be 
necessary. 

“Why?” 

r iere was no immediate reply, 
but the communication band 
remained open; and along it there 
flowed an essence of the reaction 
from the Glis: an impression of un- 
matched power, of a being so mighty 
that all other individuals in the uni- 
verse were less by some enormous 
percentage. 

Cemp felt staggered anew. 

But he telepathed: “I must tell 
someone. Somebody has to know.” 
“No other Silkies — absolutely.” 
Cemp didn’t argue. All these mi- 
lennia, the Glis had kept its identity 
hidden from the Space Silkies. He 
had a total conviction that it would 
wreck the entire planetoid to prevent 
them from learning it 

He had been lucky. It had fought 
him at a level where only a single 
chamber of the meteorite had been 
destroyed. It had restricted itself. 

“Only the top government leaders 
and the Silkie Council may know,” 
the Glis continued. 

It seemed an adequate concession. 
Yet Cemp had an awful suspicion 
that in the long past of this o-eature 
every person who uncovered its sec- 
ret had been murdered. 

Thinking thus, he could not com- 
promise. He demanded: 

“Let me have a complete view of 
you — what I caught a fleeting 
glimpse of earlier.” 

He sensed, then, that the Glis hes- 
itated. 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



35 




Cemp urged: “I promise that only 
the persons you named will be told 
about this — but we must know!” 

Floating there in the cave in his 
Silkie form, Cemp felt a change of 
energy tension in the air and in the 
ground. Although he himself put 
forth no additional probing energies, 
he recognized that barriers were go- 
ing down. 

And presently he began to record. 

His first awareness was of huge- 
ness. 

Cemp estimated after a long, mea- 
suring look that the creature, a cir- 
cular rock-like structure, was about 
a thousand feet in diameter. 

It was alive, but it was not a thing 
of flesh and blood. 

It “fed” from some inner energy 
that rivaled what existed in the heart 
of the sun. 

And Cemp noticed a remarkable 
phenomenon. 

Magnetic impulses that passed 
through the creature and impinged 
on his senses were altered in a fash- 
ion that he had never observed be- 
fore — as if they had passed through 
atoms of a different structure than 
anything that he knew. 

He remembered the fleeting im- 
pression he had had from the mole- 
cule. This was the same but on a 
massive scale. 

What startled him was that all his 
enormous training in such matters 
gave^ no clue as to what the struc- 
ture might be. 

iiT^nough?” asked the creature. 

Cemp said, “yes,” doubt- 
fully. 

The Glis accepted his reluctant 



agreement as a complete authoriza- 
tion. What had been a view through 
and past the cave wall, abruptly 
disappeared. 

The alien thought spoke into his 
mind: “I have done a very dangerous 
thing for me in thus revealing my- 
self. Therefore, I again earnestly 
impress on you the importance of a 
limited number of people being told 
what you have just witnessed.” 

In secrecy — it continued — lay 
the greates-t safety, not only for it but 
for Cemp. 

‘T believe,” said the creature, “that 
what I can do is overwhelming. But 
I could be wrong. What disturbs me 
is, there is only one of me. I would 
hate to suddenly feel the kind of fear 
that might motivate me to destroy 
an entire system.” 

The implied threat was as deadly 
— and as possible — as anything 
Cemp had ever heard. 

Cemp hesitated, feeling over- 
whelm^, desperate for — and need- 
ing — more information. 

He flashed: “How old do Silkies 
get?” Added quickly: “We’ve had no 
experience, since none has yet died 
a natural death.” 

“About a thousand of your Earth 
years,” was the answer. 

“What have you in mind for 
Earth-born Silkies? Why did you 
want us to return here?” 

Again there was a pause; once 
more the sense of colossal power. 
But presently with it there came a 
reluctant admission that new Silk- 
ies, born on planets, normally had 
less direct' knowledge of the Glis 
than those who had made the latest 
trip. 



36 



IF 




Thus, the Glis hed a great interest 
in insuring that there was plenty of 
time allowed for a good replacement 
crop of unknowing young Silkies. 

It finished: “You and I shall have 
to make a special agreement. Per- 
haps you can have E-Lerd’s position 
and be my contact.” 

Since E-Lerd no longer remem- 
bered that he was the contact, Cemp 
had no sense of having been offer- 
ed anything but . danger. 

He thought soberly: “I’ll never be 
permitted to come back here, once I 
leave.” 

But that didn’t matter. The im- 
portant thing was — 

. Get away! At once 

X 

A t the Silkie Authority, the com- 
puter gave four answers. 

Cemp rejected two at once. They 
were, in the parlance of computer 
technology “trials”. The machine 
simply presented all the bits of in- 
formation, strung out in two look- 
overs. By this means a living brain 
could examine the data in segments. 
But Cemp did not need such data — 
not now. 

Of the remaining two answers, one 
postulated a being akin to a god. 

. But Cemp had experienced 
the less-than-god-like powers of the 
Glis, in that it had twice failed to 
defeat him. True, he believed that it 
had failed to destroy him because it 
did not wish to destroy the plane- 
toid. But an omnipotent god would 
not have found that a limitation. 

He had to act as if the amazing 
fourth possibility were true. 



The picture that had come through 
was one of ancientness. 

The mighty being hidden in the 
planetoid predated most planetary 
systems, 

“In the time from which it de- 
rives,” reported the computer, “there 
were, of course, stars and star sys- 
tems, but they were different. The 
natural laws were not what they are 
today. Space and time have made ad- 
justments since then, grown older; 
and so the present appearance of the 
universe is different from what the 
Gliss knew at its beginnings. This 
seems to give it an advantage, for it 
knows some of the older shapes of 
atoms and molecules and can re- 
create them. Certain of these combi- 
nations reflect the state of matter 
when it was — the best comparison 
— younger.” 

The human government ^oup, to 
whom Cemp presented this data, were 
stunned. Like himself, they had been 
basing their entire plan cm working 
out a compromise with the Space 
Silkies. 

Now, suddenly, here was a colos- 
sal being, with unknown powers. 

“Would you say,” asked one man 
huskily, “that to a degree the Silkies 
are slaves of this creature.” 

Cemp said, “E-Lerd definitely 
didn’t know what he was dealing 
with. He simply had what he con- 
ceived to be a scientific system for 
utilizing a force of nature. The Glis 
responded to his manipulation of 
this system, as if it were simply an- 
other form of energy. But I would 
guess that it controlled him, perhaps 
through pre-conditioning, installed 
long ago.” 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



37 




As he pointed out, such a giant life 
form would not be concerned with 
the everyday living details of its sub- 
jects. It would be satisfied with hav- 
ing a way of invariably getting them 
to do what it wanted. 

“But what does it want?” That 
came from another man. 

“It goes around doing good,” said 
Cemp. He smiled a tight smile. 
“That’s the public image it tried to 
give me. I have the impression that 
it’s willing to make over the solar 
system to our specifications.” 

A t this point Mathews spoke, “Mr. 

Cemp,” he said, what does all 
this do to the Silkie situation?” 
Cemp said that the Silkies who 
had defected had clearly acted has- 
tily. “But,” he finished, “I should 
tell you that I find the Space Silkies 
a very likable group. In my opinion, 
they are not the problem. They have 
the same problem, in another way, 
that we have.” 

“Nat — ” said Charley Baxter, “do 
you trust this monster?” 

Cemp hesitated, remembering the 
deadly attacks; remembering that 
only the Kibmadine defense screen 
and energy reversal process had saved 
him; and that the great being had 
been compelled to reveal its presence 
to prevent him from forcing E-Lerd 
to open his mind — which would 
have apprised the Space Silkies of 
the nature of the Power. 

“No!” he said. 

Having spoken, he realized that 
a simple negative was not enough 
answer. It could not convey the 
reality of the terrifying danger that 
was out there in space. 



He said slowly, “I realize that my 
own motives may be suspect in what 
I am about to say. But it’s my true 
opinion. I think all Earth Silkies 
should be given full knowledge of 
the Kibmadine attack and defense 
system at once, and that they work 
in teams to keep a constant watch 
on the Glis, permitting no one to 
leave the planetoid — except to sur- 
render.” 

There was a pregnant silence. Then 
a scientist said in a small. voice, “Any 
chance of logic of levels applying?” 

“I don’t see how,” said Cemp. 

“I didn’t either,” said the man, un- 
happily. 

Camp addressed the group again: 
“I believe we should gird ourselves 
to drive this thing from the solar 
system. We’re not safe until it’s 
gone.” 

It was as he finished speaking that 
he sensed an energy tension ... fa- 
miliar! 

He had a sensation, then, of cos- 
mic distance and cosmic time — 
opening. 

Power unlimited! 

It was the same feeling he had 
had in the second attack . when 
his senses had been confused. 

The fear that came to Cemp in 
that moment had no parallel in his 
experience. It was the fear of a man 
who suddenly has a fleeting glimpse 
of death and destruction for all his 
own kind and for his planet. 

A s he had that awful conscious- 
ness, Cemp whirled from where 
he was standing. He ran headlong 
toward the great window behind him, 
shattering it with an arc of lightning 



38 



IF 




as he did so. And with eyes closed 
against the flying glass, he plunged 
out into the empty air seventy stories 
above the ground. 

As he fell, the fabric of space and 
time collapsed around him like a 
house of cards tumbling, Cemp trans- 
formed into Class C Silkie, and 
became immensely more perceptive. 
Now he sensed the nature of the co- 
lossal energy at work: a gravitational 
field so intense that it actually closed 
in upon itself. Encompassing all 
things, organic and inorganic, it 
squeezed with irresistable power — 

Defensively, Cemp put up, first, 
his inverter system. 

And perceived that that was not 
the answer. 

Instantly, he triggered gravity 
tran sformation — an infinite variable 
system, which converted the en- 
croaching superfield to a harmless 
energy in relation to himself. 

With that, he felt the change slow. 

It did not stop. But he was no 
longer so involved, no longer so en- 
veloped; and yet he was not com- 
pletely free. 

He realized what held him. He 
was oriented to this massive segment 
of space-time. To an extent, anything 
that happened here happened to hinr. 
To that* extent, he could not get 
away. 

The world grew dim. The sun dis- 
appeared. 

Cemp saw with a start that he was 
inside a chamber, and realized that 
his automatic screens had protected 
him from striking the hard, glitter- 
ing walls. 

And he became aware of three 
other realities. 



The chamber was familiar, in that 
there below him was one of the glow- 
ing images of a planet. The image 
showed the oceans and the. conti- 
nents, and the fact that he was look- 
ing down at it seemed to indicate 
that he was — somehow — back in- 
side the Silkie planetoid, in one of 
the “art” rooms. 

What was different was that as he 
looked down at the planetary image, 
he saw the familiar outlines of the 
continents and oceans of Earth. 

Realized — 

That the feeling of a virtually un- 
limited force pressing was a true ex- 
planation of what had happened. 

The ancient monster that lived at 
the core of the planetoid had taken 
Earth, compressed it and everything 
in it and on it, from an 8000-mile- 
in-diameter planet into a hundred 
foot ball and had added it to its 
fabulous collection. 

It was not a jewel-like image of 
Earth there in the floor. 

It was Earth itself. 

Even as he had the thought, Cemp 
sensed that the planetoid was increas- 
ing speed. 

He thought: “We’re leaving the 
solar system.” 

In a matter of minutes, as he ho- 
vered there, helpless to act, the speed 
of the planetoid became hundreds, 
then thousands of miles a second. 

After about an hour of continuing 
acceleration, the velocity of the tiny 
planetoid in its ever-widening hyper- 
bolic orbit was nearly half that of the 
speed of light. 

A few hours later, the planetoid 
was beyond the orbit of Pluto, and it 
was traveling at near light-speed. 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



39 





And still accelerating — 

XI 

S omewhere in there, Cemp began 
to brace himself. Anger spilled 
through him like a torrent down a 
rocky decline. 

“You incredible monster!** he tele- 
pathed. 

No answer. 

Cemp raged on: “You’re the most 
vicious creature that ever existed. 
I’m going to see that you get what’s 
coming to you!” 

This time he got a reply. “Fm 
leaving the solar system forever,” 
said the Glis. ‘Why don’t you get off 
before it’s too late? I’ll let you get 
away.” 

Cemp had no doubt of that. He 
was its most dangerous enemy, and 
his escape and unexpec^ted appear- 
ance must have come as a hideous 
shock to the Glis. 

“I’m not leaving,” he retorted, 
“until you undo what you*vc done 
to the Earth.” 

There was silence. 

“Can you and will you?” C^np 
demanded. 

“No. It’s impossible.” The re- 
sponse came reluctantly. 

“But you could, if you wanted to, 
bring Earth back to size?” 

“No. But I now wish I had not 
taken your planet,” said the Glis 
unhappily. ‘Tt has been my policy 
to 'leave alone inhabited worlds that 
are protected by powerful life forms. 
I simply couldn’t bring myself to 
believe that any Silkie was really 
dangerous to me. I was mistaken.” 
It was not the kind of repentance 



40 



IF 





that Cemp respected. “Why can’t 
you — unsqueeze — it?” he persist- 
ed. 

It seemed that the Glis could 
create a gravity field, but it could 
not reverse such a field. It said 
apologetically, “It would take as 
much power to undo it as it took 
to do it. Where is there such power?” 

Where, indeed? But still he could 
not give up. “I’ll teach you what 
anti-gravity is like,” Cemp offered, 
“from what I can do in my own 
energy control system.” 

But the Glis pointed out that it 
had had the opportunity to study 
such systems in other Silkies. “Don’t 
think I didn’t try. Evidently anti- 
gravity is a late manifestation of 
matter and energy. And I’m an early 
form — as you, and only you, 
know.” 



Cemp’s hope faded suddenly. 
Somehow, he had kept believing 
that there was a possibility. There 
wasn’t. 

The first grief touched him, the 
first real acceptance of the end of 
Earth. 

T he Glis was communicating 
again: “I can sec that you and 
I now have a serious situation be- 
tween us. So we must arrive at an 
agreement. I’ll make you the leader 
of the Silkie nation. I’ll subtly in- 
fluence everything and everyone to 
fit your wishes. Women — as many 
as you desire. Control — as mhch as 
you want. Future actions of this 
planetoid you and I shall decide.” 
Cemp did not even consider the 
offer. He said grimly, “You and I 
don’t think alike. I can just imagine 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



41 



trusting you to leave me alone if I 
ever took the chance of changing to 
human form.” 

He broke off, said curtly, “The 
deal as I see it is a limited truce, 
while I consider what I can do 
against you, and you figure out what 
to do to me.” 

“Since that’s the way you feel,” 
was the harsh reply, “let me make 
my position clear. If you begin any 
action against me, I shall first destroy 
Earth and the Silkie nation, and then 
give you my attention.” 

Cemp replied in his own steely 
fashion: “If you ever damage any- 
thing I value — and that includes all 
Silkies and what’s left of Earth — 
I’ll attack you with everything I’ve 
got.” 

The Glis said scornfully, “You 
have nothing that can touch me — 
except those defense screens that re- 
verse die attack flow. That way, you 
can use my own force against me. 
So I won’t attack. Therefore — per- 
manent stalemate.” 

Cemp said, “We’ll see.” 

The Glis said, “You yourself stat- 
ed that your levels of logic wouldn’t 
work on me.” 

“I meant not directly,” said Cemp. 
“There are many indirect approaches 
to the mind.” 

“I don’t see how anything like 
that can work on me,” was the re- 
ply. 

At the moment, Cemp didn’t eith- 
er. 

xn 

T hrough miles of passageways, up 
as well as down, and round- 



about, Cemp made his way. The 
journey took him through long 
chambers filled with furniture and 
art objects from other planets. 

En route, he saw strange and 
wonderful scenes in bas-relief and 
brilliant color on one wall after an- 
other. And always there were the 
planets themselves, glowingly beau- 
tiful, but horrifying too, in his aware- 
ness that each one represented a hid- 
eous crime. 

His destination was the city of the 
Silkies. He followed the internal 
pathway to it because he dared not 
leave the planetoid to take an ex- 
ternal route. The Glis had virtually 
admitted it had not anticipated that 
he — its most dangerous enemy — 
would survive. So if he ever left 
these caves, he would have no fur- 
ther choice, no chance to decide on 
what the penalty — if any — or the 
outcome should be, and no part at 
all in the Silkie future. For he would 
surely never be allowed to return. 

Not that there was any purpose in 
him. His grief was too deep and 
terrible. He had failed to protect, 
failed to realize, failed in his duty. 

Earth was lost. 

So quickly, so completely, a disas- 
ter so great it could not even be 
contemplated for more than instants 
at a time. 

At intervals, he mourned Joanne, 
and Charley Baxter, and other friends 
among the Special People, and the 
human race. 

By the time he was sunk into 
these miseries, he had taken up an 
observation position on top of a tree 
overlooking the main street of the 
Silkie city.

IF 




There he waited, with all of his 
signal systems constantly at peak 
alert. 

While he maintained his tireless 
vigil, the life of the Silkie commun- 
ity had its being around him. The 
fact that the Silkies continued to live 
mostly as humans began to seem 
significant. 

Cemp thought, shocked: “They’re 
being kept vulnerable.” 

In human form, they could all be 
killed in a single flash of intolerable 
flame. 

He telepathed on the Glis band: 
“Free them from that compulsion, or 
ril tell them the truth about what 
you are.” 

An immediate, ferocious answer 
came: “You say one word, and I 
shall wipe out the entire nest.” 

Cemp commanded: “Release them 
from that compulsion, or we come 
to our crisis right now!” 

His statement must have given the 
Glis pause, for there was a brief 
silence. Then: “I’ll release half of 
them. No more. I must retain some 
hold over you.” 

Cemp considered that and, real- 
ized its truth. “But it has to be on an 
alternating basis. Half are free for 
twelve hours, then the other half.” 

The Glis' accepted the compromise 
without any further argument. 

It was clear that it was prepared 
to recognize the balance of power. 

“Where are we heading?” said 
Cemp. 

“To another star system.” 

The answer did not satisfy Cemp. 
Surely, the Glis didn’t expect to go 
cm with its malignant game of col- 
lecting inhabited planets. 



He challenged, “I feel that you 
have some secret purpose.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous, and don’t 
bother me any more!” 

. .Stalemate. 

A s the days and the weeks went 
by, Cemp tried to keep track of 
the distance the planetoid wa^ cov- 
ering and the direction it was going. 

The speed of the meteorite had 
reached nearly a light year a day. 
Earth time. 

Eighty-two of those days passed. 
And then there was the feel of slow- 
ing down. The deceleration contin- 
ued all that day and the next. And, 
for Cemp, there was finally no ques- 
tion: He could not permit this 

strange craft, which was now his 
home, to arrive at a destination 
about which he knew nothing. 

“Stop this ship!” he ordered. 

The Glis replied angrily: “You 
can’t expect to control such minor 
things as this.” 

Since it could be a deadly danger- 
ous scheme, Cemp replied: ‘Then 
open yourself to me. Show me ev- 
erything you know about this sys- 
tem.” 

“I’ve never been here before.” 
“All right, then that’s what I’ll 
see when you open up.” 

“I can’t possibly let you look in- 
side me. You may see something 
this time that will make me vulner- 
able to your techniques.” 

“Then change course.” 

“No. That would mean I could 
not go anywhere until you die about 
a thousand years from now. I re- 
fuse to accept such a limitation.” 
The second reference to Silkie age

gave Cemp great pause. On Earth no 
one had known how long Silkies 
could live, since none bom there had 
died a natural death. He himself 
was only thirty-eight years of age. 

“Look,” he said finally, “If I 
have only a thousand years, why 
don’t you just sit me out? That must 
be only a pinpoint in time compared 
to your own life span.” 

“All right, weTl do that!” replied 
the Glis. 

But the deceleration continued. 

Cemp telepathed: “If you don’t 
turn aside, I must take action.” 

“What can you do?” was the con- 
temptuous response. 

It was a good question. What, in- 
deed? 

“I warn you,” said Cemp. 

“Just don’t tell anyone about me. 
Other than that do anything you 
please.” 

Cemp said, “I gather you’ve de- 
cided I’m not dangerous. And this 
is the way you act with those you 
consider harmless.” 

The Glis said Aat it believed that, 
if he had been able to do something, 
he would already have done it. It 
finished: “And so I tell you flatly, 
I’m going to do as / please; and the 
only restriction on you is, don’t vio- 
late my need for secrecy. Now, don’t 
bother me again.” 

T he meaning of the dismissal was 
clear. He had been judged to be 
helpless. Categorized as someone 
whose desires need not be considered. 
The eighty days of inaction had 
stood against him. He hadn’t at- 
tacked; therefore he couldn’t. That 
was palpably die other’s logic. 



Well . what could he da? 

He could make an energy assault 
But it would take time to mount, and 
he could expect that the Silkie nation 
would be wiped out in retaliation, 
and Earth destroyed. 

Cemp decided he was not ready 
to force such a calamity. 

He was presently dismayed to 
realize that the Glis’s analysis was 
correct. He could keep his mind shut 
and respect its need for secrecy — 
and nothing more. * 

He ought, it seemed to him, to 
point out to the Glis that there were 
different tvpes of secrecy. Grada- 
tions. Secrecy about itself was one 
type. But secrecy about the star sys- 
tem ahead was quite another. The 
whole subject of secrecy — 

Cemp’s mind poised. Then he 
thought: “How could I have missed 
it?” 

Yet, even as he had the awareness, 
he realized how it happened. The 
Glis’s need to withhold knowledge of 
itself had seemed understandable. 
And somehow the naturalness of it 
had made him by-pass its implica- 
tions. But now — 

“Secrecy!” he thought. “Of course! 
Thafs itr 

To Silkies, secrecy was an under- 
stood phenomenon. 

After a few more seconds of 
thinking about it, Cemp took his first 
action. He reversed gravity in rela- 
tion to the planetoid mass below 
him. Light as a thistledown he float- 
ed up and away from the tree top 
that had been his observation post for 
so long. 

Soon he was speeding along gran- 
ite corridors. 



IF 




xm 

H e reached without incident the 
chamber which contained 
Earth. 

As he set his signals, so that all 
his screens would protect that prec- 
ious found ball, Cemp permitted 
himself another increment of hope. 

“Secrets!” he thought again, and 
his mind soared. 

Life, in its natural impulse, had 
no secrets. 

Baby gurgled, or cried, or mani- 
fested needs, instant by instant, as 
each feeling was experienced. But 
the child, growing older, was pro- 
gressively admonished and inhibited; 
subjected to a thousand restraints. 
Yet all his life the growing being 
would want open-ness and unre- 
straint; would struggle to free him- 
self from childhood — and that was 
what it was — conditioning. 

Conditioning was not of itself 
logic of levels. But it was related; a 
step lower, only. The appearance 
was of a control center; that is, a 
rigidity. But it was a created center, 
which could be repeatedly mobilized 
by the correct stimulus. That part 
was automatic. 

The decisive fact was that, since 
the Glis' had conditioned itself to 
secrecy ... it was conditionable. 

H aving reached this penultimate 
point in his analysis, Cemp 
hesitated. As a Silkie, he was condi- 
tioned to incapacitate rather than 
kill, to negotiate rather than incapac- 
itate, and to promote well being 
everywhere. 

Even for the Glis, death should be 



the final consideratkm, not the first. 

And so he telepathed: “In all your 
long span, you have feared that 
someone would one day learn how to 
destroy you. I have to tell you that 
I am that feared person. So, unless 
you are prepared to back down 
from those insolent statements of a 
little while ago, then you also must 
die.” 

The answer came ’ coldly, “I let 
you go to your planet. Earth, be- 
cause I have the real hostages under 
my complete control. The Silkie 
Nation!” 

“That is your final statement?” 
Cemp questioned. 

“Yes. Cease these foolish threats! 
They are beginning to irritate me.” 

Cemp now used the words: “I 
know where you come from, what 
you are, and what happened to oth- 
ers like you.” 

He, of course, knew nothing of 
the kind. But it was the technique. 
By stating the gen^alization, he 
would evoke the Glis’s perception 
and memory network, first, the truth. 
Then, like all living things, the Glis 
would immediately have the impulse 
automatically to give forth with the 
data as it actually was. 

Yet, before it could be so, it would 
exercise the restraint of . secrecy. 

And that would be an exact pat- 
tern, a reaffirmation of similar, pre- 
cise restraints in its long, long past. 
His problem was to utilize it before 
it de-stimulated. Because so long as 
it held it was the equivalent of a 
logic of levels Gestalt. 

Having, according to the theory, 
mobilized it, Cemp transmitted the 
triggering signal. 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



45 




A startled thought came from the 
Glis: “What have you done?^ 

It was Cemp’s turn to be sly, cov- 
ert, scheming. He said, “I had to call 
to your attention that you had bet- 
ter deal with me.** 

It was too late, but the pretense — 
if successful — ^might save many lives. 

“I wish to point out,” said the 
Glis, “that I have not yet damaged 
anything of value.** 

Cemp was profoundly relieved to 
hear the statement. But he had no 
regrets. With such a creature as this, 
he could not hope to repeat what he 
was doing against it. Once the pro- 
cess was started, it was all or noth- 
ing. 

“What was it you said before 
about bargaining?” the Glis asked, 
urgently. 

Cemp steeled himself against 
sympathy. 

The Glis continued: “I’ll give you 
all my secrets in exchange for you 
telling me what you’re doing to me. 
I’m experiencing severe internal dis- 
turbance, and I don’t know why.” 

C emp hesitated. It was a tremen- 
dous offer. But he divined 
that, once he made it, he would have 
to keep such a promise. 

What had happened was that, as 
he had hoped, his final signal had 
triggered the equivalent of a colony 
Gestalt, in this instance the process 
by which life forms slowly over the 
years and the milennia adjusted to 
exterior change. 

. The cycle-completing control 
centers, the growth-change mechan- 
ism in the great being, were stim- 
ulated. 



Silkies understood the nature of 
growth. And of change they knew 
much from their own bodies. But 
Silkies were late indeed in the scheme 
of life. Their cells were as old as 
the rocks and the planets, in terms of 
cvolvement. The entire history of 
life’s progression was in every cell 
of a Silkie. 

That could not be true of the 
Glis. It was from an ancient eon, 
and it had stopped time within it- 
self. Or at least it had not passed 
on its seed, which was the way of 
chance through time. In itself, it 
manifested old, primitive forms. 
Great forms they were, but the mem- 
ory in each cell would be limited to 
what had gone before. 

Therefore, it couldn’t know what, 
in holding back as it had, it was 
holding back from. 

“I promise not to go on to the 
Nijjan system,” said the Glis. “Ob- 
serve — I’m already turning aside.” 

Cemp sensed a change in the di- 
rection of the planetoid. But it 
seemed a minor act; not meaningful. 

He merely noted, in passing, the 
identity of the star the Glis had 
named; observed that, since it knew 
the name, it had been there before. 
Which seemed to imply that it had 
had a purpose in going there. 

It didn’t matter; they were turn- 
ing away from it, would never reach 
it. If there was a threat there for 
himself, or Silkies, it was now divert- 
ed; had been useful only in that it 
had forced him to action regardless 
of consequences. 

The Glis’s willingness to make 
amends when it no longer had any 
choice was merely a sad commen- 



46 



IF 




tary on its character, but much too 
late. Many planets— Cemp thought 
— too late. 

How many? he wondered. 

And because he was in the strange 
set emotion of someone whose whole 
thought and effort is concentrated 
on a single, intensely felt purpose, 
he asked the question automatically 
— as it came into his mind. 

“I don’t think I should tell you; 
you might hold it against me,” the 
Glis replied. 

I t must have sensed Cemp’s ada- 
mant state, for it broke off, said 
quickly, “Eighteen hundred and 
twenty-three.” 

So many! 

The total of them did not shock 
Cemp. It hurt him. For one of that 
countless number of unecessary dead 
on those planets was Joanne. An- 
other was Charley Baxter. 

“Why have you done all this?” 
Cemp asked. “\^y destroy all those 
planets?” 

“They were so beautiful.” 

True. Cemp had a sudden mental 
vision of a great planet hanging in 
space, its atmosphere ballooning up 
above the oceans and mountains and 
plains. He had seen that sight often, 
yet found it always a thing of splen- 
dor beyond all the visual delights of 
the universe. 

The feeling passed, for a planet 
was beautiful when it was brooded 
over by its parent sun, and not as a 
shrunken museum piece. 

The Glis with its planets was like 
a head hunter of old. Skillfully, he 
had murdered each victim. Patient- 
ly, he had reduced the head to its 



small size. Lovingly, he had placed it 
in his collection. 

For the headhunter, each perfect 
miniature head was a symbol of his 
manhood. For the Glis, the planets 
were — what? 

Cemp couldn’t imagine. 

But he had delayed long enough. 
He sensed incipient violence- on the 
communication band. He said has- 
tily, “All right, I agree — as soon as 
you do what I want. I’ll tell you.” 
“What do you want?” 

Cemp said, “First, let the other 
Silkies go outside.” 

“But you’ll do as I’ve asked?” 
“Yes. When you’ve released them, 
put me and the Earth outside, safe- 
ly.” 

“Then you’ll tell me?” 

“Yes.” 

The Glis threatened: “If you 

don’t. I’ll smash your little planet. 
I will not let you or it escape if you 
don’t tell me.” 

“I’ll tell you.” 

XIV 

T he method that was used was, 
the entire section of the plane- 
toid surrounding Cemp simply lifted 
up and shot off into the sky. Cemp 
found himself floating in empty, 
black space, surrounded by meteor- 
ite debris. 

The Glis’s thought came to him: 
*T have done my part. Now tell me!” 
Even as Cemp complied, he began 
to wonder if he himself really un- 
derstood what was happening. 

Uneasiness came. In setting in mo- 
tion a cycle-completion process, he 
had taken it for granted that Nature 



SILKIES IN SPACE 



47 




would strike a balance. An old life 
form had somehow been preserved 
here, and in its body evolution was 
now proceeding at lightning speed. 
Millions of years of change had al- 
ready been compressed into minutes 
of time. Since none other of its kind 
remained alive, he had assumed that 
the species had long since evolved 
to — what? 

What was this creature? A chrys- 
alis? An egg? Would it become a but- 
terfly of space? a great worm? or a 
gigantic bird? 

Such possibilities had not occurred 
to him before. He had thought only 
of the possibility of extinction. 

But — it struck him keenly — ^he 
hadn’t considered seriously enough 
what that . extinction . might 
consist of in its end product. 

Indeed, he hadn’t thought about 
there being an end product. 

Unhappily, Cemp remembered 
what the computer had reported; 
That the atomic structure of this 
giant being reflected a younger state 
of matter. 

Could it be that, as the particles 
“adjusted” and changed to current 
norm, there would be a release of 
energy on a hidierto unknown scale? 

Distracted, Cemp thought: “What 
will it‘ evolve to?” 

B elow, a titanic thing happened. 

Part of the planetoid lifted. 

^ A solid ball of red-hot matter, at 
least a mile thick, lifted slowly out 
of it. As Cemp drew aside to let the 
improbable thing pass him, he saw 
an even more unlikely phenomenon 
was taking place. The “up” speed of 
the chunk of now white hot rock and 



dirt was increasing — and the mass 
was growing in size. 

It was well past him, and it was at 
least a hundred miles in diameter. 
A minute later, it was five hundred 
miles thick, and it was still expand- 
ing, still increasing speed. 

It expanded to a burning, incred- 
ible mass. 

Suddenly, it was ten thousand 
miles in dianieter; and was still going 
away, still growing. 

Cemp sent out a« general alarm: 
“Get away — as fast as you can. 
Away!” 

As he himself, fled, using a rever- 
sal of gravity on the monstrous body 
behind him, he saw that in those few 
minutes it had grown to a sun over 
a hundred thousand miles thick. 

It was quite pink at his point; 
strangely, beautifully pink. 

The color altered even as he 
watched; turned faintly yellow. And 
the body that emitted the beautiful 
ochre light was now over a million 
miles in diameter. 

As big as Earth’s sun. 

In minutes more, it grew to the 
size of a giant blue sun; ten times 
the diameter of Sol. 

It began to turn pink again. And 
it grew one hundred times in ten 
minutes. 

Brighter than Mira the Wonder- 
ful. Bigger than glorious Ras Algethi, 

But pink, not red. A deeper pink 
than before; not red, so definitely 
not a variable. 

All around was the starry universe, 
bright with unfamiliar objects that 
glowed near and far; hundreds of 
them, strung out like a long line of 
jack-o-lanterns. 



48 



IF 




Below was Earth. 

C emp looked at that scene in the 
heavens, and then at the near, 
familiar planet; and an awful excite- 
ment seized him. 

He thought: Is it possible that ev- 
erything had to grow; its change al- 
tered this entire area of space-time? 

Old forms could not keep their 
compressed state once the super- 
colossal pink giant completed the 
growth that had somehow been ar- 
rested from time’s beginning. 

And so the Glis was now a sun 
in its prime, but with eighteen hun- 
dred and twenty-three planets strung 
out like so many starry brilliants 
over the whole near sky. 

Everywhere he looked were plan- 
ets so close they looked like moons. 

He made a quick, anxious calcu- 
lation. And realized with great re- 
lief that all that he could see were 
still within the warming area of the 
monstrous sun that hung out there, 
half a light-year away. 

As Cemp descended, at the top 
speed that his Silkie body could with- 
stand, into the huge atmosphere 
blanket that surrounded Earth . 
everything seemed the same — the 
land, the sea, the cities — 

He swooped low over one high- 
way and observed cars going along 
it. 

He headed for the Silkie Author- 
ity in a haze of wonder, and saw the 
shattered window from which he 
had leaped so dramatically — 

— Not yet repaired! 



When, moments later, he landed 
among the same group of men who 
had been there at his departure, he 
realized there had been some kind of 
a time stasis, related to size. 

For Earth, and its people, all that 
eighty days had been . eighty sec- 
onds. 

— Afterwards, he would hear how 
people had experienced what seemed 
like an earthquake, tension in their 
bodies, momentary sensory black- 
out, a brief feeling that it was dark — 

Now, as he entered, Cemp trans- 
formed to human form and said in 
a piercing voice: “Gentlemen, pre- 
pare for the most remarkable piece 
of information in the history of the 
universe. That pink sun out there is 
not the result of an atmospheric dis- 
tortion. 

“And, gentlemen. Earth now has 
eighteen hundred inhabited sistc 
planets. 

“Let’s begin to organize for a 
fantastic future!” 

L ater, comfortably back in his 
Florida home, Cemp said to 
Joanne: 

“Now we can see why the Silkie 
problem didn’t have a solution as 
things stood. For Earth, two thou- 
sand of us was saturation. But in 
this new sun system — ” 

It was no longer a case of what to 
do with the six thousand members 
of the Silkie nation, but how could 
they get a hundred such groups to 
cope with the work to be done? 
Quickly! END

IF ♦ Short Story 



THE HISTORIAN 

by CARROLL J. CLEM 



Here's the whole saga of Man's 
conquest of the starlanes — and 
how the triumph came to an end! 



Chapter 34 

A s was stated in the last chap- 
ter, Earth had established bases 
on the Moon. By 2087, Mars had 
been colonized: four self-sustaining 
communities were thriving on the 
Red Planet. Thirty years later, the 
impossible was realized in the form 
of an atomic drive. The new propul- 
sion principle made travel to the 
stars practical. Human civilization 
spread into other cultures. However, 
since no intelligence was found to 
equal his own, man felt it his duty 
to enrich, teach and otherwise aid 
the alien races. 

44 Awright, Bugs, let’s go! You 
think we took you outa them 
stinkin’ huts for nothin’?” 

“Sergeant, it’s not necessary to 
continue this shouting. They’re al- 
ready filing out,, as you can see.” 



”Yes, sir, but it’s the only thing 
they listen to. The louder you talk 
the better they listen.” 

“Er . Sergeant, there’s one 
over there who hasn’t moved.” 

“Hey! You! Get goin’! Uh, it’s 
dead. Startin’ to rot too. Nothin’ 
but a damn big bug.” 

“Well, it doesn’t matter, they’re 
all aboard now. Just leave him . 
it. We’ll never be back to this pri- 
mitive, filthy world.” 

“Sir, did you hear about the 
speech Rauvkaus made a few days 
ago?” 

“Who’s Rauvkaus?” 

“You know, sir. When this planet 
was first discovered. Colonel Erric- 
son and his men brought one of the 
chief Bugs — Rauvkaus — back to 
Earth, taught him our language. And 
the damned cockroach has been 
stirrin’ up trouble ever since.” 
“What did he say?” 



50 





“Said his people — people, get 
that, people! Ha! — they were bein* 
shipp^ to the salt mines. Salt 
mines? What’s a salt mine anyway?” 
“It doesn’t matter what he said. 
We’re civilizing an entire race, a 
whole planet of primitive arthro- 
pods.” 

“Well, Lieutenant, if you’re 
ready? After you, sir.” 

“There she is, Sergeant, my first 
command, the Arciurus IV, Named 
after our destination, the only planet 
where Biotemp is grown. Marvelous 
substance. Enables a human to live 
for 200 years or more. Too bad 
about the original population: all 
died off. Measles. Funny how com- 
mon Earth diseases hit some races. 
Doesn’t matter though, the pincers 
on the Bugs are perfect for remov- 
ing the fruit of the Biotemp vine.” 
“Damn! Look, sir — two more 
dead Bugs. There’s a man throwin’ 
’em out the hatch.” 

“So much death, Sergeant. Fine 
way to celebrate my sixty-first birth- 
day!” 

“Just out of navigation school, 
right, sir?” 

“Yes, Sergeant, I’m just starting 
out.” 

“That’s great, sir. Wish I had gone 
myself, but things were tough.” 

T here were hostile beings, how- 
ever, and if the colonists were 
endangered, it was necessary to elim- 
inate the creatures. But the essential 
eradication was done in a humane 
manner and and only animals which 
did not show intelligence were elimi- 
nated — quickly, qiiietly and honcw- 
ably. 



''T^hey are coming. Great One. 

A There is nothing we can do. 
They are stronger than we. They 
come from beyond the last sun. 
They are our conquerors. 

Great One, they are just outside. 
Be strong. We will meet again. 

44''T^hree days trackin’, boy. Now 
A we’ll have some* fun.” 

“I’ll do it, but I won’t enjoy it. 
Corporal.” 

“Drop the ‘Corporal’, boy. You’re 
a cadet; I’m a regular. ^ what? 
We’re buddies. All right? Let’s have 
some target practice.” 

“It’s dark in here. Bring your 
light?” 

“Sure, boy. There, you can see 
’em way in the back.- Usual group — 
eight young, one old.” 

“How can you tell the old one 
from the others?” 

“He’s in the back of the cave. 
You can barely see him. His fur is 
droppin* out and his teeth are worn 
down. And God, what fangs!” 
“That’s what’s worry me, Joe. If 
they’re so vicious, why haven’t they 
attacked us?” 

“Scared! That’s why! They’re 
scared to death! You can tell by 
lookin’ at’ em that tl^ir fangs and 
claws could tear hedl out of you. 
Grab your blaster, boy. Stop talkin’ 
and start shootin’. Watch this, it’s 
a barrel of laughs when you bum 
off a couple of arms and they just 
sit and stare, full of contempt. If 
they weren’t so scared of our guns 
they’d kill us!” 

“Yeah, I guess so.” 

“Okay, boy, I out ’em all down 
but two and they’re all yours.” 



THE HISTORIAN

G reat One, I can’t bear the pain. 

It will pass, child. You must be 
patient. There is another world 
without pain where these creatures 
can never reach us. 

I know. Great One. We will be 
together again. But why do they 
torture us? 

They think that we will do them 
harm. Our appearance is grotesque 
in their eyes. They are a young race, 
but they are killing themselves while 
yet children. 

Great One, the time has come. 
The suffering is . 

Good-by, my child. 

44T Tev. Joe, look over here. Some 
tracks, leading out” 

“Right, boy. But let’s pick up the 
teeth of these back here so the 
governor will give credit for our 
trouble.” 

‘Trouble? Are you kidding? I 
haven’t had so much fun in years!” 

I n spite of the difficulties man en- 
countered, he explored and 
settled the entire galaxy. But he 
did not meet a race of equivalent in- 
telligence in all his wanderings. 

“Are you finished, Mr. Chap- 
man?” the officer asked. 

“No,” he replied, **but Fm quit- 



ting. You can finish it yoursdf.” 
“But Mr. Chapman, no one can 
equal your ability in writing a his- 
tory of the galaxy’s masters.”^ 

“I disagree; the remaining work 
is yours.” 

“Thank you, Fll try. Yes, I be- 
lieve I will.” 

He picked up Chapman’s final 
page and read : “’ ... did not meet 
a race of equivalent intelligence in 
all his wanderings.’ Yes, Mr. Chap- 
man, just a small addendum: ‘The 
race was more intelligent.’ Is that 
not correct, Mr. Chapman?” 

The officer smiled as he laid 
down the pen, his single eye spark- 
ling in his scaly face. 

“Now, sir,” he said, “if you will 
follow the guard to the Preserving 
Section, the — uh . ‘race of 
man’ will live forever in you and 
your great work, side by side, in 
our museum of extinct peoples.” 
After Chapman had gone, the of- 
ficer slumped onto his front legs, 
his smile gone. “I wish we could 
have saved a female also. Only half 
of a pair is worthless. Perhaps a 
replica could be nwide imder Mr. 
Chapman’s directions. If the female 
is like him, the work should not be 
too difficult. He could very easily 
be duplicated!” END

THE HIDE HIMERS 

by ROBERT MOORE WtLUAMS 

Hlustrated by ADKINS 



The man with the weapon was a friend 
— - but friendship was only skin deep! 



I 

S itting in the shade to avoid the hot 
sun of the upper Amazon, Ed 
Grayson fanned himself and listened 
to the old chief plead for the rifle 
lying on top of the packing case. 

“Please give gun,” the old chief 
said. 

“Why do you want the rifle?” 
Grayson questioned. 

“Want her to kill grandson,” the 
old chief answered, hate popping in 
his eyes. 

“To kill your grandson!” Grayson 
gasped. “But that’s — ” 

He was going to say that this was 



murder but caught himself bef<m he 
spoke. In this hot and savage wild- 
erness in upper Brazil, a world where 
few white men had ever penetrated 
in modem times, minder might have 
a different definition than it had in 
the more civilized countries. Here in 
this place th^e was no law and never 
had been. Tribal custom took its 
place. Perhaps it was the custom 
among this tribe for the grandfather 
to kill the grandson! Afto all, if this 
were true, it would be only a step 
away from the latent hostility 
found by the psychoanalysts to ex- 
ist at the unconscious mind levels 
among civilized people, in whidi the 



53 





father either killed the son or drove 
him away from home. 

“Why would you want to kill your 
grandson?” Ed Grayson asked. He 
made his voice as calm and as rea- 
sonable as possible. Perhaps, if the 
old chief could be made to think that 
killing a grandson was a common 
practice among white men, he could 
be induced to explain. 

Trying to answer, the old native 
wrinkled his face until he looked like 
a howler monkey, seeking among the 
little Portuguese, Spanish and Eng- 
lish that he knew for the right words 
to express his thoughts. 

He needed no words to express his 
emotion. His face revealed that he 
was feeling only hate — this in blaz- 
ing intensity. But he had problems 
in expressing clearly what was on his 
mind. 

“Grandson dead already,” he be- 
gan. 

“Then you can’t kill him,” Gray- 
son said. 

“Want kill his hide!” the old chief 
said. Triumph was in his voice. He 
had said what he wanted to say, even 
in clumsy English. Certain that he 
would be understood, and his request 
granted, he reached for the rifle. 

Grayson grabbed the long gun and 
laid it across his knees. As if this was 
what he had been reaching for all 
the time, the old chief fingered a 
thick coil of stout nylon cord lying 
on top of the packing case. 

“I don’t understand,” Ed Gray- 
son said. He forced his voice to be 
calm. “If your grandson is dead — ” 

“But his hide is alive!” the chief 
shouted. “Want kill hide. Give gun.” 
Again he reached for the weapon. 



“No!” Grayson said. He swung 
the muzzle of the gun so that it 
covered the native. The old chief 
settled back on his heels. Squatting 
there, toothless and almost hairless, 
with flabby flesh hanging loosely on 
twisted bones, he suddenly looked as 
ancient as the hills, as worn as erod- 
ed mountains. 

T he rifle would make him big, 
would enable him to stand erect, 
would make him — if not young 
again, still it would enable him to be 
a man again, a leader of his own 
people. 

If only this stupid white man 
would give him the gun! Didn’t the 
white man know the danger that ex- 
isted here in this hot country of the 
upper river? Was the white man so 
ignorant of real life as it existed 
here to hold back because of fanci- 
ful notions about the word called 
murder? Didn’t the white man real- 
ize that death was the only solution 
for some problems? 

Wondering how a man could be 
dead but his skin could still be alive, 
Ed Grayson was silent. He was a 
young man, a chemist, and at age 27 
he was known as a comer in that 
part of the scientific and industrial 
complex that was interested in chem- 
istry. Here in this jungle world he 
did not feel at home and never had. 
Something about the fetid jungle, 
the hot, steaming wetness of the 
place, the gross sexuality of it, trou- 
bled him deep in his mind where the 
old fears of the race still lived. Sud- 
denly he wished that McPherson was 
back in camp with him. 

But McPherson had gone back 

IF 



54 




down the river wkh Ihe last weekly 
trip of the helicopter that brought 
supplies up to them and took away 
for shipment overseas any yagate 
roots they had been able to find. 

Grayson and McPherson were 
both chemists. Since each also had 
a streak of adventurer’s blood in him, 
they made an excellent team. A Swiss 
drug company was paying them ex- 
cellent salaries — and was also pick- 
ing up the tab for the cost of the 
helicopter — to make a thorough 
search through this country of the 
upper Amazon for a plant called 
yagate by the natives who Kved in 
this regkm. 

This was the century of the psy- 
chedelic drug, with many curious- 
minded humans using such con- 
sciousness-expanding drugs in an ef- 
fort to see what was beyond the lim- 
ited and limiting structure of their 
own personalities, what was over and 
above file fimited frame of reference 
of their dafly lives. Abroad in the 
world again was the idea that was 
old when Egypt was new, when Baal- 
bek was building, when Ur was a 
new place in the land of the Chal- 
dees. That idea was that men did not 
see all of the universe with their 
eyes or hear all of it with their ears 
or grasp all thoughts with their con- 
scious minds, and that beyond the 
world men saw in their daily lives 
were other worlds, perhaps other 
univers^. Perhaps the Earth itself 
was dual, perhaps men at most saw 
only half of it! Perhaps the devil 
was more than a myth and perhaps 
there was a god who sometimes 
spoke to men in a still, small voice! 

At least, these were some of the 



ideas that were emerging from the 
transcendental experiences of those 
who were experimenting with the 
psychedelic drugs. The questions to 
which they sought answers were as 
old as the race of men. 

Since experience had indicated 
fiiat nature was the first and biggest 
manufacturer of psychedelic sub- 
stances, companies supplying the de- 
mand for psychedelic drugs were go- 
ing to nature for the raw material 
they needed, to the swamps, to the 
jungles, to the forests and to the 
fields. LSD 25 had come from a fun- 
gus growing on rye grain. Psilocybin 
had ccKne from a mushroom grow- 
ing wild in the jungle country of 
Mexico. Mescaline had come from a 
small cactus called peyote which 
grew wild in the desert country of 
the southwestern United States and 
northern Mexico. Another conscious- 
ness-expanding drug had come from 
the seeds of the blue morning glory. 

Yagate was — or was rumored to 
be — a plant growing in the jungle 
swamps of the upper Amazon which 
bad consciousness-expanding alka- 
loids in it. 

“This is what brought me here,” 
Ed Grayson thought, running over 
the chain of circumstances that had 
brought him to the upper Amazon. 
“Now that I am here, I have the 
privilege of watching this old chief 
make up his mind whether he is 
strong enough to knock me down and 
take this rifle away from me by 
force! The old devil is almost civil- 
ized in his attitudes! He just wants 
a gun. He doesn’t give a hoot about 
the ethics or the morals involved!” 
Bitterness rose in him at the thought. 



56 



IF 




4 4/^inune gun, I kill hide of 

VjT grandsonr the old chief 
spoke, 

“Gimme H-bomb, I kill everybody 
who disagrees with me!“ Grayson 
said. He had not intended to make 
such a statement, but the words, 
driven by the rising bitterness in him, 
had popped unbidden from his 
mouth. 

“Hunh?** the chief grunted. H- 
bomb was a word he did not under- 
stand. 

“Gimme laser beam, I fry every- 
body the H-bomb leaves alive!** 
Gravson continued. 

“Huh-hunh?” the chief asked. He 
did not understand the words but he 
got the underlying idea readily 
enough. “Where can get H-bomb, 
where can get laser thing?” he ask- 
ed, eagerness rising in his voice. “Use 
to kill devils who wear grandson’s 
hide. Where can get — ^** 

“Oh, go to hell, you murderous 
old devil!” Grayson said. He was 
shocked at the words that had pop- 
ped from his own mouth. “No, I’m 
not going to give you this rifle. To 
make murder legal, moral and ethi- 
cal, you have to be a nation, and 
civilized. And even then you have to 
call it war. “No!” 

A wave df resentment crossed the 
old chiefs face, then was gone as 
another course of action came to his 
mind. Reaching into the hide bag 
which he always carried, he produc- 
ed a gnarled and twisted root. 

“That’s yagate,” Grayson said. 
Automatically he reached for it. 

The old chief jerked it back. “Gim- 
me gun,” he said. “Will show where 
to find root, lots of root.” 



“You’re trying to bnbe me!” 
Grayson gasped. 

“When white men do it is called 
trade** the chief answered. Again 
he reached for the rifle. 

“If I give you the rifle, you may 
use it to kill several innocent people. 
I don’t want their blood on my 
hands,” Grayson said. “The answer 
is — no!” 

Rising to his feet, he entered the 
nylon tent. Looking throu^ the open 
flap, he saw the old chief rise and 
stalk angrily into the jungle. He felt 
a little sorry for the native. The old 
man had a problem of some kind, 
but the problem, whatever it was, 
could not be solved with a rifle bul- 
let. 

If the old chief had claimed that 
a man-eating jaguar was killing his 
people, Grayson would have loaned 
him the gun, and gladly. But to kill 
the hide of his grandson! 

To the chemist, this made no 
sense whatsoever. 

n 

P erhaps an hour later, Grayson 
noticed that the coil of nylon 
cord was missing from the top of 
the packing case. He did not doubt 
that it had gone into the skin bag 
while his back had been turned as 
he entered the tent. 

“If I let him get away with mur- 
der, he’ll rouse the whole jungle,” 
Grayson thought. “And our root 
hunting will be at an end.” 

Picking up the rifle, he followed 
the dim trail the old chief had taken 
as he had stalked angrily into the 
jungle. Under a tall tree at the edge 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



57 




of a little clearing, he caught a 
glimpse of the old warrior squatting 
on the ground beside something that 
Grayson could not make out. Seeing 
him coming, the old man scowled 
and brought up the point of the 
knife he was using. He made no at- 
tempt to throw it or to strike with 
it as Grayson approached but he 
held it ready. 

A noose in one end, the long 
nylon cord lay on the ground. Look- 
ing up into the tree, Grayson saw 
where the old chief had crouched 
above the trail, the nylon noose 
dangling and ready for anything that 
passed beneath. 

Looking down, Grayson saw on 
the ground what had passed under 
the tree. His first thought was that 
it was an animal. Nausea crawled in 
his stomach as he saw that it was a 
human being. The nausea grew 
stronger when he saw that the old 
chief had almost finished skinning 
what he had caught in his noose. 

“You — “ Grayson began. 

Ignoring him, the old chief fin- 
ished skinning his captive. Tugging 
at the skin, he pulled it free from the 
body on the ground. Picking up the 
skin, he reverently carried it to the 
other side of the clearing. There, as 
gently as any mother could have 
laid down a sleeping baby, he laid 
the skin on the ground. Carefully, 
he straightened the legs and arms, 
then, knife in hand, he returned to 
face the white man. 

“You not give gun, I use noose,** 
the old chief said. 

“You — ’’ So far Grayson got be- 
fore he choked. 

The old chief pointed to the skin 



he had laid on the ground. “That 
hide of grandson,” he said. 

He pointed again, this time at the 
body. “That Ugo devil,” he said. 
Bitterness too deep for words was in 
the tone of his voice. 

F or the first time, Grayson really 
looked at the body. There were 
several strange things about it, he 
saw, but his first impression was 
that it was covered with soft white 
fur. He also saw that it showed no 
indication of bleeding, this in spite 
of having been skinned. There was 
something else about it that was very 
strange. Or perhaps the strangeness 
was in his eyes. But wherever it was, 
in the body or in his eyes, the body 
gave the impression that really it 
was without shape or form. As he 
watched, it seemed to be flowing, 
moving, twisting, changing in a way 
that was quite impossible to describe. 

Moving closer, he saw that the 
body was covered with a sort of 
white syrupy liquid instead of blood 
and that what he had thought was 
white fur was actually thousands, 
perhaps millions, of small white 
tubes about as big as hair which had 
connected this body to the skin that 
the old chief had so gently laid to 
one side. 

In removing the hide from the 
body, the old chief had simply sev- 
ered these millions of tiny tubes. 

Again, Grayson felt nausea trying 
to rise within him. He pointed at the 
body. Words babbled on his lips. He 
knew he was trying to ask where that 
body had come from, what kind of 
a body it was, were there others like 
it anywhere in this jungle? 



58 



IF 




“Ugo devil!” the old chief said. 
In his world, there was no restriction 
against kicking a fallen enemy. He 
did just this. Drawing back his foot, 
he kicked with his heel, a heavy 
blow that rolled the body over. 

The body rolled from the kick. 
And kept on rolling. When it reached 
the edge of the little clearing, it 
leaped to its feet. 

Howling, it fled along the trail. 

< 4 T T ung with noose, stuck with 
-n. knife, thought was dead?” 
the old chief gasped. “What needed 
to kill Ugo devil?” 

Grayson was trying to say this 
was a question he could not answer 
when the old chief seemed to find a 
solution. Snatching the rifle from the 
chemist’s un-nerved hands, he fired 
at the body running along the trail. 

The body kept on running. Before 
the chief could shoot a second time, 
it had disappeared around a bend in 
the trail. Swearing, working the bolt 
of the gun, the chief ran after it. 

Neither the body nor the chief re- 
turned. When the shadows began to 
grow thick in the jungle, Grayson re- 
traced his steps to the nylon tent in 
the bend of the river where he and 
McPherson had established their 
base camp. Iriside the tent was Mc- 
Pherson’s rifle. Grabbing it, Gray- 
son feverishly slid a cartridge into 
the firing chamber. 

The night that followed was bad. 
Images of a human skin reverently 
laid out on one side of a clearing 
and of a skinless body fleeing howl- 
ing up a jungle trail danced in the 
chemist’s mind every time he tried 
to go to sleep. 



He had seen something that all of 
his training and experience had told 
him could not happen. He knew the 
memory of what he had seen this 
afternoon would remain with him all 
of his life and would return to haunt 
his dreams forever. Seeing that skin- 
less body running howling up a 
jungle trail was a sight that no man 
would ever forget. Whaf was the 
creature the old chief had expertly 
roped with a noose in a nylon cord? 
Where had it come from? Were there 
others like it? Was it perhaps hunt- 
ing through the dark night for an- 
other hide to occupy? Had it seemed 
to lose shape because it had no real 
shape of its own? Did it flow like 
water to assume the shape of any 
container it occupied? If it flowed 
into the skin of a jaguar would it 
become a iaguar? If it flowed into 
the hide of a bushmaster, would it 
become that deadly snake? If it 
flowed into the hide of a human 
would it talk like a man, think like 
a man, walk like a man? Where did 
it get the skin it occupied? Did it 
kill a human, then skin him, then 
did it slip inside the hide it had 
stolen? 

In spite of all of the mapping from 
the air and in spite of the expeditions 
that had laboriously crawled by boat 
along the rivers, what did science 
really know about the green hell of 
the Amazon jungle? 

S ometime just before day, Ed 
Grayson slipped into uneasy 
slumber. 

He awakened with a jump that 
lifted him completely off the cot. 
Outside the tent were howling noises. 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



59 




With McPherson’s rifle in his hands, 
Grayson got outside the tent just in 
time to see the helicopter settle to 
the cleared space that served as a 
landing area. At the controls was the 
pilot whose handlebar mustache 
made him look like a pirate. Grin- 
ning cheerfully through the plastic 
cabin was McPherson. 

Ed Grayson thought he had never 
been so glad to see anybody in his 
life as this tall Scot. Setting the ship 
down, the pilot left the motor run- 
ning while he descended to listen to 
the sound of the vanes. Grayson took 
his partner into the nylon tent and 
tried to tell the tall Scotchman what 
had happened. McPherson listened 
with little patience. 

“Ed, you shouldn’t use yagate un- 
less somebody is with you. It’s worse 
than drinkiitg alone,” McPherson 
said. “There is no predicting what 
any human will think he sees, hears, 
or feels while under the influence of 
any of these psychedelic drugs.” 

“I wasn’t using yagate,” Grayson 
said. 

“No?” McPherson’s black eye- 
brows formed questioning twin v’s 
on his forehead. “Did you find some 
wild morning glory? Or perhaps 
some sacred mushrooms? We can 
get a good price for either of these.” 

“I didn’t use any psychedelic 
drug,” Ed Grayson said. “I’m telling 
you what I saw with my own eyes.” 

“Oh,” McPherson said. He looked 
out the raised flap of the tent, to the 
clearing where the pilot with the 
handlebar mustache was still listen- 
ing to the whine of the helicopter 
vanes. “Oh,” he repeated. “Ed, while 
the ship is still here, maybe you had 



better use it to run back down the 
river. Have the pilot take you far 
enough downstream to find a really 
good hospital. Stay there for a week 
and get a thorough checkup.” 

“But — ” Grayson tried to say. 

“There are obscure infections here 
in this jungle that sometimes hit the 
white man in strange ways. Having 
lived with them, the natives are us- 
ually pretty immune.” 

“I know that — ” 

“These down-river dods have been 
dealing with these infections for a 
long time,” McPherson continued, 
seemingly without hearing his com- 
panion’s protest. Quietly, as if this 
was the thing to do, he lifted his 
rifle from Grayson’s hands. Taking 
the elbow of Grayson’s right arm, 
he urged his companion out into the 
clearing and toward the helicopter. 

“Damnit — ” Grayson began. The 
sudden decision and quick action of 
his companion had dazed him. He 
wanted to protest that he was not 
crazy, that he had really seen what 
he claimed to have seen, but he 
knew his companion was acting in 
his own best interests and that if 
their positions had been reversed, he 
would have insisted on McPherson 
going downriver for a medical check- 
up and a possible psychiatric evalu- 
ation. In this jungle your life often 
depended on your companion. Who 
wanted to risk his own life by having 
a crazy man as a partner? 

“I’ll handle everything here while 
you are gone,” McPherson said. “I’ll 
hunt up the old chief who showed 
you that yagate root and see if I 
can bribe him into showing me 
where he got it. Hola, pilot! My 



60 



IF 




partner is going back downriver with 
you.** 

Grinning, the pilot turned a brown 
face and amiable brown eyes toward 
them. 

“Just a little checkup — ” 
McPherson ducked as a humming- 
bird darted from the jungle behind 
them passed within inches of his 
head. 

F ollowing the flight of the hum- 
mingbird with his eyes, Grayson 
saw what happened. “That hum- 
mingbird stuck its bill into the pilot’s 
forehead,” he said. 

Already shaken mentally and 
emotionally by McPherson’s calm 
decision and quick action, Grayson 
had little emotion left to invest in 
so strange a sight as a hummingbird 
committing suicide by ramming its 
fragile beak into the hard skull of a 
man. To Ed Grayson at this moment 
diis was just another incomprehen- 
sible thing that could happen. 

“Hah?” McPherson said. He 
stared at the pilot. A bit of bright 
red color had suddenly bloomed on 
the forehead of the helicopter man. 
“Hummingbird, hell — ” McPherson 
began, then ducked again as a second 
whistle* soundpd in the air above 
him. 

“That one stuck its bill in the 
pilot’s cheek,” Grayson said. 

The pilot was reaching for the 
first bright red spot when the second 
spot appeared. He grabbed at it, 
jerked it from his skin, then reached 
up to his forehead and pulled out 
the first hummingbird. Holding them 
both in one hand, he looked at them. 
As he looked his brown face seemed 



to turn white. Lifting his eyes, he 
stared toward the jungle behind the 
two white men moving toward him. 

Seeing something there, he turned 
quickly and ran toward the cabin. 
Getting one foot on the step, he 
seemed to slip and to fall against 
the side of the ship. As he tried to 
stand erect, two other hummingbirds 
struck him, each adding ‘a spot of 
red as a decoration for the brown 
shirt he was wearing. 

“Hummingbirds, hell!” McPher- 
son gasped. “Those are poison darts 
from blowguns!” 

Turning toward the jungle, he 
fired repeated shots from the rifle. 

“I see them!” Grayson 5aid. “The 
jungle is crowded with natives.” 
Staring, it seemed to Ed Grayson 
that the green growth of the jungle 
had suddenly sprouted a growth of 
long tubes. 

Some of the tubes dropped away 
as McPherson fired at them. But 
others remained. And as McPherson 
emptied the rifle, all that remained 
were converging on the two white 
men. 

“Into the helicopter?” the Scot 
shouted. Turning, he and Grayson 
ran toward the ship. 

HI 

A head of them, the pilot had 
spread out both arms. Looking 
like a drunken man trying to balance 
himself, he seemed to go into a 
slow dance. 

For a moment he looked like some 
native dancer moving in unison to 
the beat of a funeral drum. He 
seemed to have forgotten die ship. 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



61 




Instead of trying again to climb in- 
to the protection of the cabin, where 
the plastic would stop blowgun darts, 
he started to scream. Running and 
screaming, he disappeared into the 
green jungle. 

Ed Grayson leaped headfirst into 
the cabin of the helicopter. Right be- 
hind him, McPherson jerked the 
door shut. Like little feather-decor- 
ated ornaments, darts struck the out- 
side of the cabin, to fall away from 
the tough plastic without penetrating. 

The vanes of the ship were still 
turning. 

“I watched the pilot on the way 
up here,” McPherson said. “I can 
fly one of these ships if I have to.” 
He settled himself into the pilot’s 
seat and advanced the throttle. 

“But the pilot — ” Grayson tried 
to protest. 

“We’ll try and find him from the 
air, then maybe we can pick him 
up,” McPherson answered. Under 
the advanced throttle, the motor 
throbbed heavily. Rotor vanes be- 
gan to sing at a higher pitch. The 
ship started to lift but was down on 
the right. McPherson compensated 
for the right drop — and over-com- 
pensated and the ship dropped left. 
He brought it back to something 
near level and the ship lurched into 
the air. 

The spinning vanes brushed vege- 
tation at the edge of the clearing. 
McPherson shoved the throttle wide 
open. The ship seemed to leap into 
the sky. Before he could check it, 
the helicopter was high above the 
trees and was caught in a stiff wind 
that did not exist on the jimgle floor 
but which blew heavily hwe in the 



sky. Catching the helicopter, the 
wind hurled it westward, toward a 
group of low hills that rose like 
mounds at the place where the rising 
land was trying to stop being jungle 
and was attempting to become an 
erosion sloping eastward from the 
mighty Andes to the west. 

In spite of all that McPherson 
could do to bring it under control, 
the wind flung the helicopter to a 
crash landing at the edge of a pile of 
huge, tumbled stones on top of the 
centermost of the low hills. 

The safety belt in the pilot’s seat 
saved McPherson but Grayson had 
neglected to fasten his safety belt, 
with the result that he was flung 
across the cabin. He struck the door 
just as it was wrenched open beneath 
him. He hit the ground on his feet. 
Careening from the tumbled rocks, 
the helicopter missed him, but as he 
went to the ground, he felt a stabbing 
jolt of pain shoot up his left leg and 
he knew he had either sprained or 
broken his ankle. In a thunder of 
ripping vanes and tearing metal and 
breaking plastic, the helicopter came 
to rest. 

Fortunately McPherson had the 
presence of mind to turn off the 
motor, with the result that the wreck- 
age did not catch fire. 

Ed Grayson, sitting on the ground 
and holding his left ankle with both 
hands, looked up as McPherson 
came over to him. McPherson’s face 
was covered with sweat and he was 
obviously on the edge of the shakes. 

iC^'^hings sure do happen fast 
A around here,” McPherson 
said, wiping his face. “First the na-

IF 




lives shoot the pilot full of poisoned 
darts, then I crash the helicopter. Ed, 
I’m just damned sorry. Are you bad- 
ly hurt?” 

“It’s a sprain, I think,” Grayson 
said. 

“There’s a first aid kit in the heli- 
copter. There’s also a machete and 
a .38 revolver. We’ve got the rifle, 
but no ammunition for it. I’ll get the 
kit.” 

Grayson could not endure the 
pressure of a bandage on his rapid- 
ly swelling ankle. With the machete, 
McPherson cut a crutch from a 
forked sapling. Using this to support 
his weight, Grayson was able to 
hobble. 

“We’ll hole up here until your 
ankle gets well enough for you to 
walk, then we’ll go down to the river 
and buy or steal a dugout canoe,” 
McPherson decided. “You have the 
pilot’s pistol. The machete will be 
enough for me.” 

The .38 had been made in Spain. 
It was rusty but looked as if it would 
work. Fully loaded, Grayson slipped 
it under his belt. A box of extra 
cartridges went into his pocket. 

“There’s a tarp in the helicopter,** 
McPherson said. “We’ll use it to 
stretch between those two big rocks. 
In this way, we’ll have enough of a 
tent to keep the rain off of us.” Mc- 
Pherson’s voice went into silence. 
When he spoke again, his expression 
had startled surprise in it. 

“Look, Ed, at the carvings on 
that flat rock! If those are not Egyp- 
tian hieroglyphics — ” 

“Oh, nuts!” Grayson said. “Now 
you’re the one who has been eating 
yagate.” Then Grayson saw the 



huge flat stone to which his com- 
panion was pointing. His voice went 
into silence too. 

Once this flat stone had been a 
part of a building. This much was 
obvious at first glance. Perhaps all 
of the stones here had once been a 
part of a structure that had existed 
here. As this thought passed through 
his mind, Ed Grayson . caught a 
glimpse of this building — so fast did 
his imagination operate — as it had 
once existed. 

He saw a building such as had 
once existed in Karnak, in ancient 
Egypt, heavy stone columns forming 
the front of a temple which had 
faced a court. Only the building that 
had once existed here had not faced 
a court. It had faced a huge altar 
stone. Turning to his left, Grayson 
saw the altar stone still in place. 

Beyond the altar stone was a long 
oval of darkness that he had not 
noticed until now. A hole was there, 
or a pit, or a shaft, which led down- 
ward. 

Bringing his eyes back to the first 
stone, he saw carvings there, a man 
with the head of a jackal, a man 
with the head of a hawk. He knew 
instantly that these were symbols 
for some of the gods ci ancient 
Egypt, for Anubis, for Thoth, for 
Osiris. 

“But this is Braziir be heard Mc- 
Pherson protest. “There is no known 
connection between Egypt and the 
country of the uppo* Amazon.” The 
tone of McPherson’s voice said he 
had come face to face with a wonder 
that was stretching his mind beyond 
its permissible limits. 

“There is a known connection

IF 






now,” Grayson said. “It’s right there 
on those rocks and we know it.” 
“But how—” 

“I can’t explain it either,” Gray- 
son said. “Look at that figure!” 

T he figure to which he pointed 
was larger than any of the oth- 
ers. It showed the ibis-headed god 
standing on top of a huge snake 
which he had speared. 

“The Egyptian name for that 
ibis-headed god was Thoth, which 
means truth,” Grayson said. “A sym- 
bol such as this can only mean that 
they are trying to convey the idea 
that truth has conquered or is con- 
quering or will conquer something 
which they have symbolized as a 
snake. What do you suppose the 
masons who cut this symbol were 
trying to tell us?” In the chemist’s 
voice awe and wonder were mixed. 

“Damned if I know,” McPherson 
answered. “Maybe they were trying 
to warn others that snakes existed in 
Ais jungle.” 

“And maybe they expected every- 
body who saw this symbol to know 
about the snakes in die jungle,” 
Grayson said. He was still bitter 
about the way his companion had 
reacted to his report of the old 
chief skinning what looked like a 
human. “Maybe in the symbol of 
that snake they were trying to tell 
us about something evil, sinister, 
dangerous, perhaps deadly, some- 
thing that goes like a snake with its 
belly upon the ground.” Grayson’s 
voice was suddenly heavy with 
emotion. 

“Oh, come off it, Ed,” McPherson 
said. “Maybe the Egyptians believed 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



65 




in evil things but that was thousands 
of years ago. We know better than 
to call anything evil today. There are 
plenty of things that are not on our 
side, but that does not mean they 
are evil, just that they are different. 
The sooner we stop using such silly 
labels, the better for us.” 

“Remember, I saw something run 
howling along a jungle trail,” Gray- 
son answered. “M^atever that thing 
was, I would call it more than dif- 
ferent. I would call it evil. And so 
would the old chief who cut his 
grandson’s skin off of it!” 

“Oh, the devil — ” McPherson 
said, obviously shaken. 

“Perhaps,” Grayson answered. 
“What do you mean by perhaps^ 
McPherson answered. “You don’t 
mean that you believe there’s some- 
thing in these jungles that you would 
be justified in calling a devil.” 

“The old chief believes it,” Gray- 
son interrupted. “And sure as hell, 
there is something here in these 
jungles that is either a devil — or be- 
longs to a different system of evolu- 
tion than we do.” 

“But where — 

“How would I know where it 
came from?” Grayson said. “How do 
I know where I came from? Where 
did the human race come from? 
Where did life itself come from? 
Every idea on this subject is theory, 
which means that somebody has 
been guessing. The truth is, we don’t 
know the first thing about the origin 
of life. Maybe it started in a hole 
in the ground and has been working 
its way surf ace ward ever since!” 
“Started in a hole in the 
ground — ” McPherson began, then 



was silent. For the first time, he had 
become aware of the huge stone al- 
tar and of the oval-shaped opening 
beyond it. Shock was on his face as 
he glanced at his companion. “Ed — ” 
“I didn’t say that was where life 
really started,” Grayson said. “I 
said for all we know to the contrary, 
it could have started in a hole in 
the ground, but I’m guessing and I 
know it. Let’s go look at that altar 
and at that hole in the ground.” 

W ith the machete, McPherson 
cleared away some of the 
tough growth. Grayson hobbled be- 
hind him. 

The altar stone was made of black 
basalt. It was smooth on top — from 
scouring by other stones or from the 
passage of many, many bare feet 
across it. McPherson climbed to 
the top, then reached down and gave 
Grayson a hand. Standing on the 
huge stone, with the hot jungle sun 
beating down on them, they looked 
down. And down. And down. Into 
the hole. Into the pit. Into blackness 
that grew blacker and blacker as it 
went farther and farther down. 
Struck simultaneously by slight dizzi- 
ness, both men moved back. 

“Do you suppose they threw their 
victims from this altar into that 
pit?” McPherson gasped. His voice 
was a whisper of shocked sound. 

“Guessing again, I would say that 
was exactly what they did.” 

“But why?” 

“Maybe they were feeding, or 
thought they were feeding, or be- 
lieved they were feeding somthing 
that lived down in that hole,” Gray- 
son answered. His voice was a dry 



66 



IF 




rattle in the wind. He shifted the 
weight on his crutch to ease the pain 
in his left ankle. 

“Oh, hell — ” McPherson began. 

^ “Maybe that’s what they thought 
was down at the bottom of that pit,” 
Grayson said. 

“But damnit, Ed — ” 

“Just a little while ago, I told you 
a preposterous story of a skinned 
creature running howling up a jungle 
trail,” Grayson went on. “You didn’t 
believe me. What if the people who 
built this temple here threw living 
victims from this altar into this pit, 
because they believed that some 
angry deity, some minor god, lived 
down there in that pit, and that by 
making sacrifices to it, they were 
gaining its favor, or were protecting 
themselves from its depredations — ” 
“Oh, hell, Ed!” McPherson wiped 
sweat from his face. “You’re in a 
state of shock.” 

“Here’s the altar, there’s the pit,” 
Grayson went on. “I know what I 
saw. You make what you can of all 
of it. You put it together in your im- 
agination and see how it fits.” 

“But what you claim you saw ex- 
ists now, if it exists at all,” the 
Scotsman protested. “This altar, the 
ruins here, are thousands of years 
old. If the people who lived here 
were sacrificing to something that 
lived in this pit, something like a gi- 
gantic amoeba, it would be dead 
now. All the people who lived here 
are gone.” 

“But perhaps the thing in the pit 
is immortal. Perhaps it is still alive!” 
“Immortal!” McPherson’s voice 
rose in outrage. “Get hold of your- 
self, Ed.” 



‘The more primitive a creature is, 
the longer it may live. Think of 
turtles! They live hundreds of years. 
There are crabs that can grow new 
claws if an old one is lost. Perhaps 
there is a still more primitive type of 
life that can take on other forms.” 
Grayson, shaken by what he was 
saying, shook his head at his own 
words. “I would say that is nonsense, 
if I thought I knew the difference 
between fact and non-fact. But right 
now I’m not sure — ” 

“Right now you’re in a state of 
shock, Ed,” McPherson said. “Tell 
me — ” his voice grew anxious — 
“Did you bit your head when the 
ship crashed.” 

“No,” Grayson said. “I know I’m 
in shock. But I keep remembering 
that something is loose in the. jungle 
which once wore the skin of a hu- 
man, but which lost that skin. I keep 
wondering if it is looking for an- 
other human skin.” 

“Sit down and rest, Ed,” McPher- 
son urged. Helping his companion 
down from the altar, the Scotsman 
found a spot in the shade. “You rest 
here, Ed. I want to drop a rock down 
that hole and see if I can guess how 
deep it is. I also want to look at 
it a little closer and see if it is nat- 
ural or artificial.” 

IV 

G rayson, resting, tried to ignore 
the pain in his ankle as Mc- 
Pherson chopped his way through 
the tangle of vines and shrubs to the 
edge of the oval-shaped pit. Here the 
Scotsman went out of sight. Grayson 
heard him shout, then wait for an 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



67 




answer, and he knew that McPher- 
son was yelling down the pit the 
way a small boy calls down an empty 
barrel, to hear an echo. Eventually 
the vScot returned. His face, glisten- 
ing with sweat, was pale. 

“If you could walk, I would vote 
for us to get the hell out of here,” 
the tall man said. 

“What’s wrong now?” 

“That damned hole isn’t natural. 
Somebody dug it. They must have 
dug another shaft beside it because 
I can see regular openings in the 
side wall of the pit but I haven’t 
- found the shaft opening yet.” Mc- 
Pherson wiped sweat from his face. 
He gestured toward the symbols on 
the huge rocks. “Whether the 
Egyptians had a colony here or 
whether the people who lived here 
had been taught to write by the 
Egyptians, I don’t know. It doesn’t 
matter much. What bothers me is 
how they could have dug this Mo- 
hole with the primitive tools they 
had. What bothers me worse is why 
they dug h.” 

Grayson grunted tonelessly. “The 
why of it shakes me too. How deep 
is it?” 

“That bothers me most of all,” 
McPh^^n said. “I try to yell down 
it. No echo returns. I toss a rock 
down it and listen. I hear the sound 
of the falling rock hitting the sides 
growing weaker but I never hear that 
rode splash as it hits bottom.” 

“Um,” Grayson said. A wind that 
was both hot and cold at the same 
time seemed to blow over the jungle. 
The wind brought with it the scent 
of slime, of dampness and of decay, 
of things ^at mouldered much 



too long in the dark. “Maybe there’s 
mud on the bottom. Maybe your 
rock hit soft mud and made no 
noise.” 

“I thought of that,” McPherson 
said. “I also thought of the Mayan 
sacrificial wells in Yucatan. The 
Mayans tossed human sacrifices 
down those holes. They also tossed 
gold and gems with the victims. For- 
tunes have been recovered from 
some of those Mayan wells . .” 
“I’ve heard tell,” Grayson said. 
“Are you thinking of coming back 
here with a government permit, with 
soldiers to fight the Indians, and a 
derrick to swing a bucket out over 
the hole and enough steel cable to 
reach the bottom?” 

“I thought we’d try to find the 
entrance to the shaft and go that 
way first,” McPherson said. “That 
is, if we live long enough to get out 
of here and to return.” 

“You don’t feel right about this 
place?” Grayson asked. 

“I feel wrong as hell about it,” 
the tall Scot answered. “There’s 
something here in the air that I 
want to try to cut to pieces with a 
machete. Only there’s not anything 
here in the air, and I know it. I 
guess I’m in shock too,” he ended, 
shaking his head. 

“You still want to come back 
even if you don’t feel right about the 
place?” 

“Hell, yes. I’m a Highlander. 
We’ve dealt with ghosts and demons 
and bogles and things that go bump 
in the night much too long to start 
running from them now.” 

“Then you believe in that sort of 
stuff?”

IF 




“I’m afraid I do,” McPherson an- 
swered. “Scientific training had laid 
a veneer over me. But under that 
veneer, I’m a Celtic clansman right 
out of the ancient days when magic 
was a living force in the world. 
Something about this place scares 
the Celt in me.” With the machete, 
he made switching motions in the 
air. 

F or both men, sleep was uneasy 
and irregular this night. Gray- 
son dozed with the pilot’s .38 ready 
in his hand. McPherson kept the 
machete where he could touch it in- 
stantly. 

The wrecked helicopter yielded 
two strong flashlights. They made a 
small fire in the space between the 
two huge boulders. Grayson awak- 
ened several times during the night 
»nd clutched the gun to find it was 
only McPherson stirring the blaze — 
and not a creature searching in the 
dark for a lost hide, as he had feared. 
Sounds came in the night, a cough 
that could have been made by a 
jaguar, a grunt that could have come 
from a wild pig, and a scream that 
died into slow silence and which 
could only have come from the 
throat of a monkey that had awak- 
ened too late to the approach of the 
python. 

The echo of that fading scream 
lingered in Grayson’s mind long 
after the sound had gone from his 
ears. 

When morning came, both men 
were in a state of nerves. Grayson’s 
ankle was badly swollen. Even with 
the crutch, movement was a painful 
ordeal. McPherson found fruit in 



the jungle and brought it to his com- 
panion. They ate in silence. 

McPherson glanced toward the 
wrecked helicopter. Lifting the ma- 
chete, he got quickly to his feet. 
Following the line of his compan- 
ion’s gaze, Grayson saw what had at- 
tracted McPherson’s attention. At 
the sight, Grayson pulled himself 
to his feet and leaned on his crutch. 

A man was coming toward them. 

It was the helicopter pilot. At this 
short distance, there was no mistak- 
ing the man’s features, and even if 
these had been in doubt, the long 
handlebar mustache would have pro- 
vid?d certain identification. 

“He’s dead!” McPherson whis- 
pered. “The poison on one dart is 
enoiurh to kill a man. I saw at least 
three darts strike him!” 

“He’s still walking,” Grayson said. 

“Maybe he has become a zombie,” 
McPherson whispered. He glanced at 
his companion. “Get that .38 ready!” 

Pulling the pistol from his beh, 
Gravson held it ready. 

The man coming toward them 
seemed dazed. He had lost his hat, 
his clothing hung in shreds from his 
body, his brown outer shirt had been 
tom off and the white undershirt 
was only a rag now. Torn by briars, 
bis pants legs were wet at the bot- 
tom and he had either removed his 
shoes or had lost them. Stumbling as 
if he did not notice where he was 
putting his feet, he walked past the 
wrecked helicopter wfthout seeing it. 
Nor did he seem to see the two men 
though he was walking toward them. 

“Poor devil! He’s full of arrow 
poison,” Grayson said, sympathy in 
his voice. He started to call out to 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



69 




the pilot but McPherson checked 
him v/ith a quick gesture. 

“He walked right past the wreck 
of his own helicopter without notic- 
ing it,” McPherson whispered. “I 
don’t like that.” 

“The arrow poison — 

“I’m not sure it’s arrow poison.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“You said the old chief had 
skinned something, which had then 
run, howling, down a jungle trail. 
You said this thing might be looking 
for another hide.” 

Cold winds blew along Ed Gray- 
son’s spine. 

Stumbling, the pilot walked past 
them without seeing them. His gaze 
seemed centered on an invisible ob- 
ject hanging in the air. Or was he 
listening to a sound that they could 
not hear? 

As he got past them, the cold 
winds blew all over Grayson’s body. 

A thick, rope-like red line ran 
down the middle of the man’s back. 
Starting in a furrow in his hair, it 
disappeared under the belt at his 
back, then began again on each leg 
where the torn pants ended. 

CCT Te’s been skinned!” McPher- 
AA son whispered. “That’s not 
the pilot, that’s something else wear- 
ing his hide!” He lifted his voice in 
a shout. “Hey, you!” 

The thmg in the skin of the pilot 
heard McPherson’s voice and turned 
to ^ook toward the source of the 
sound. 

Now for the first time, Ed Gray- 
son got a look at the eyes. The eyes 
of the pilot had been liquid brown 
and merry. The eyes of this creature 



were black — and were filled with 
wild hate and equally wild fear. 

Grayson could tell nothing about 
the brain of the creature that owned 
these eyes. All he could see was the 
hate-fear in the eyes, hate as old as 
the Earth was old, hate as deep as 
the Earth was deep, hate for any 
creature or for any life-form that had 
climbed the evolutionary ladder fas- 
ter than this monster had done, hate 
because this monster of its own 
choice had refused to climb the long 
and painful ladder that led upward to 
the stars and now was trying to 
hitch a piggyback ride on other life 
forms that had gone through the 
long, slow growth processes. 

As Grayson saw the hate that was 
in those eyes, he also saw the fear 
that was there. 

This monster was scared of ev- 
erything, but mostly it was scared of 
sunlight. This was one big reason it 
hunted hides; it wanted protection 
from the sunlight. Long eons had 
gone into perfecting the skin of a 
human. A hide had to be sensitive, 
it had to feel the wind and to re- 
port whether that wind was hot or 
cold. In the darkness of the jungle, 
the skin had to report whether it 
was touching a wet branch or a py- 
thon. It had to respond to the 
caress of a mate. On the other hand, 
if the skin was too sensitive, the sun 
would burn it and the cold winds 
would freeze it. 

Having no proper skin of its own, 
this monster had to steal the skins of 
other creatures. It was trying to be- 
come a gigantic inner parasite on 
other life forms that were moving 
upward. 



70 



IF 





The creature looked at the two 
men. Pleasure seemed to light its 
eyes. It seemed to think that here 
were two new skins to be had for 
the taking. It moved toward them, 
hands stretched out to grab at them. 

With one sweep of the machete, 
McPherson cut off both arms at the 
wrist. 

This could not have been the 
creature’s first contact with a sharp- 
edged weapon but perhaps this was 
the first time it had met the long 
knife called a machete. Perhaps it 
did not understand the long knife 
but it understood pain. It jerked 
backward.* 

The quick backward movement 
was all that saved its head. The sec- 
ond sweep of the machete was aimed 
at its neck but the long knife met 
only air as the moster leaped away. 



Before McPherson could strike a 
third time, the monster had turned 
and was fleeing, howling toward the 
big altar stone. 

M cPherson followed it. Ignoring 
the pain in his foot, Gray- 
son hobbled to the altar stone and 
pulled himself on top of it, the gun 
ready in his right hand. In the minds 
of both men was a single thought, 
that this monster was for killing, for 
destruction, for obliteration, for 
sweeping off the stage of creation as 
a horrible abortion of nature. Just 
to see this thing wearing the hide of 
a human was to want to kill it! 

Grayson saw the monster reach 
the lip of the oval-shaped hole. For 
an instant, it paused there, apparent- 
ly wanting to jump down this bot- 
tomless well. Somehow Grayson got 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



71 




the impression that this well was 
home to it, that this was where it 
had cniginated and that this was 
where it wanted to flee, that down 
below were others of its kind who 
would succor it Looking down the 
hole, it tried to jump, then backed 
away. 

At this pmnt Grayson shot at it 
but the bullet from the rusty ,38 
went wide of the mark. Howling, the 
creature leaped into the under- 
growth, McPherson, arrivin^^ at this 
moment, followed it. Later McPher- 
son’s voice came from a short dis- 
tance away, calling to Grayson. 

Hobbling on his crutch, the chem- 
ist reached the spot where his com- 
panion waited. McPherson was 
standing in front of a v-shaped open- 
ing formed by two large blocks of 
stone that had tumbled from some 
higher elevation in some remote 
past. 

“It ran in there,** the tall Scot 
said, pointing. “There are steps lead- 
ing down. I think the steps lead to 
the openings at the side of the well. 
I’ll want the big flashlight that we 
took from the helicopter.” 

“You’re going down there?” 
Grayson questioned. 

“Yes,” MacPherson answered. He 
held up the blade of the machete 
for inspection. A whitish syrupy 
fluid stained the blade of the long 
knife. “The pilot had red blood in 
him* This thing — ” His words faded 
into silence. “Yes, I’m going down 
there. Wait here until I get the flash- 
light.” 

When McPherson returned, Gray- 
son tried to argue him out of enter- 
ing the cleft between the two stones. 



The Scot was adamant. “I’m sorry, 
Ed, but I’m scared. And when I’m 
scared, I have to face the thing that 
scares me. Otherwise I can’t live with 
myself. I would appreciate it if you 
would not try to argue with me. In- 
stead, go back to our camp and 
wait for me there.” 

Grayson tried to get the Scot to 
take the gun but McPherson refused. 
“I’ve got this,” he said, making the 
machete whistle in the air. “Some- 
how I feel better going after what- 
ever is down there with a knife. Be- 
sides, with your ankle, you may need 
the gun. Thanks for the offer, 
though.” 

As McPherson went down the 
steps, it seemed to Grayson that his 
friend and companion was a light 
growing smaller and smaller as it 
descended deeper and deeper into a 
lower world that grew darker and 
darker. 

Then McPherson turned a corner 
and the light disappeared into some 
grim underworld the existence of 
which was known only to a few sav- 
ages that inhabited this bitter jungle- 
land. 

V 

A t the entrance to the cleft, Ed 
Grayson waited. And waited. 
And waited. 

Finally the approach of night sent 
him back to camp. Rummaging in 
the wreckage of the helicopter, he 
found two cans of beans which the 
foresighted pilot had stored in the 
ship against an emergency landing 
somewhere. 

When the emergency landing had 

IF 



72 




come, the pilot had not been in a 
position to take advantage of his own 
foresightedness. 

As he built up a small fire and 
set one can of beans to warm in the 
blaze, Grayson found something 
which destroyed what little appetite 
he had developed. This was the 
hands of the pilot, severed from the 
arms at the wrists by a single blow 
of the sharp machete. 

The hand had shrunk to doll size, 
to a size that would fit the shrunken 
human heads the Jivaros made in 
this same region. However, these 
hands had not shrunk as a result of 
being carefullv cured in the smoke 
of a wood fire — as was true of the 
grisly trophies the headhunters pre- 
pared — but had shrunk as a result 
of their contents running out of 
them. 

Whatever the monster was that 
used the skins of humans as a means 
of achieving form, it could not long 
maintain itself without the help of 
a restraining form. 

Carrying the tiny hands on a stick, 
Grayson took them away and buried 
them. 

Several hours later, long after 
darkness had fallen, he was able to 
eat the can of beans. Even then he 
was not able to sleep. All around him 
were the night sounds of the jungle, 
the chitter of bats, the booms, the 
thumps, and the screams of insects. 
He pretended to himself that this 
cacaphony was keeping him awake 
but he knew the real reason he could 
not sleep lay in the hope that he 
might catch a glimpse of McPher- 
son’s light as the Scot returned to 
camp. 



Never had a man been so lonely 
as Ed Grayson was this night. 

As he sat by the tiny fire, watch- 
ing and waiting, the night sounds be- 
gan to go into silence. He did not no- 
tice that this was happening until 
he realized very suddenly that it had 
already happened and that he was 
sitting almost in the center of -a pool 
of silence. He knew then that some- 
thing which he had not seen but 
which the insect life had detected 
had come silently out of the night 
and was now very close to him. 

Slowly, he pulled the revolver from 
his belt and cuddled it in his right 
hand. With his left hand, he picked 
up the flashlight. The fire had died 
to a few coals. Looking beyond it, 
he caught an outline of something 
against the sky. Fear gripped at his 
stomach, then relaxed as he saw that 
the outline was hiunan. 

“Mac!” he shouted. “Damn you, 
McPherson, why didn’t you call out? 
I almost shot you.” 

Relief was in him. McPherson was 
back and he was no longer alone in 
this haunted place. Holding the flash- 
light in his left hand, he tried to 
pull himself up on his crutch. The 
result was he dropped the flashlight. 

“Mac, come on to the fire. Mac, 
I found a can of beans in the heli- 
copter! Mac, come on in and eat!” 
Groping for the flashlight, Grayson 
called out to his friend. As he found 
the flashlight, he saw that McPher- 
son was approaching. As the Scot 
neared him, he got a whiff of a nau- 
seous odor. 

“Mac, you smell like hell! What 
did you fall into down in that pit? 
Are you all right, Mac?” 



THE HIDE HUNTERS 



73 




Lifting the flashlight, he threw 
the bea n toward McPherson. 

Swish: ing the machete, McPherson 
was coming toward him. 

U nder the beam of light, Grayson 
caught one glimpse of McPher- 
son’s eyes. 

They were not the gray of the Celt. 
They were as black as midnight. 

As he reaBzed the meaning of 
this, he realized two other things. 
The first was that the creature wield- 
ing the machete intended to use that 
long knife to cut him into two 
pieces; the second was that this was 
not his friend McPherson who had 
come back from some underworld. 
Not at all. This was something wear- 
ing McPherson’s hide! 

Somewhere in that grim under- 
world that he had entered, McPher- 
son had lost a battle, the last one he 
would ever lose! 

Grayson shot the monster in the 
throat, then shot again and again and 
again, pumping lead into the head 
and into where he assumed the heart 
might be, emptying the pistol before 
the razor edge of the machete could 
reach him. The creature dropped the 
machete and turned away. Grayson 
grabbed the machete. Hobbling on 
his crutch, holding the flashlight and 
the crutch in the same hand, Gray- 
son followed. The creature slipped 
and went down. With the machete, 
Grayson hacked it into bits. As he 
struck with the long knife, he scream- 
ed again. 

“I’ll come back and avenge you, 
Mac! I swear I will. I’ll bring an 
army back here. I swear I will.” 
Again and gain he struck with the 



machete, until he could no longer 
lift the blade. Then he hobbled back 
to the fire. For the rest of the night, 
he made no pretense at sleep. At the 
first light of dawn, he was hobbling 
on his crutch down the slope that 
led toward the river. 

A group of natives were coming 
up the hill. As he glimpsed them 
coming toward him, Grayson recog- 
nized their leader. It was the old 
chief, who had taken Grayson’s rifle 
and had used it to fire -at something 
fleeing, howling, along the jungle 
trail where it had just been skinned. 
The old chief still had the rifle. 
The possession of the long gun had 
given him enough authority to raise 
many fighting men. Armed with long 
blowguns and with spears, they were 
following him now. 

Shouting a greeting, with joy rising 
in him at this unexpected deliver- 
ance, Grayson hobbled toward the 
group. 

At the sight of him, the old chief 
lifted the rifle. 

“Ho, devil!” the old chief shouted 
at Ed Grayson. “Ho Ugo devil! Ho!” 

With the rifle, the old chief shot 
him through the heart. 

A s the sun rose over the little hill 
with the tumbled boulders with 
the strange writing on them, it re- 
vealed a number of natives grouped 
around the oval-shaped opening of 
the pit cut into the solid rock of this 
strange hill. Gently — as if they hop- 
ed that being gentle now would 
somehow compensate for the evil of 
their recent mistake — the natives let 
the body of Ed Grayson slide into 
the pit. END

Jane) Citizen — no rabid SF fana- 
tic, but someone who just happens 
to enjoy reading an occasional sci- 
ence-fiction magazine — you prob- 
ably found the very idea of “ama- 



CARTER 



Our Man in Fandom fakes us on a 
guided tour of the world of fanzine 
publishing — mass-production stylel 



teur magazines** fantastic. I know 
it does sound odd — whole maga- 
zines written, illustrated, edited, 
published and circulated privately! 
It sounds way-out, when described 
so baldly, eh? Well, it’s even wayer- 
out (if there is such a term) when 
you stop to think that all this leisure- 
time activity and effort, as well as 
a not-inconsiderable amount of wal- 
let-squeezing, is poured into publi- 
cations that seldom go out to more 
than a couple of hundred people. 
And, most often, for free. 

Well, you ain’t heard nuttin yet. 
There’s a whole other hemisphere to 
the world of fanzine-publishing — 



75 





regular clubs-full of editors only, 
who limit the circulation of their 
little magazines to members only, 
(Fannish slang labels these groups 
“APAs” — short for “amateur press 
associations.”) 

But before delving into the 
strange world of AP Adorn — an in- 
group within an in-group, if ever 
there was — we have one question 
to consider first. Some of you 
write, in regard to fanzines, asking 
the very good question, “Why do 
these fans devote so much time and 
effort to publishing something only 
200 people will read — what do 
they get out of fanzine-publishing 
that makes worth while all the time 
and thought and trouble (to say 
nothing of expense) they put into 
it?” 

Some thoughts on this, then, first. 

Never Underestimate the Power of a Hebby 

W HAT MAKES a guy either 
solicit, or compose him#clf, 
stories, articles, verse, book and 
movie reviews, letters, cartoons and 
such-like, from other amateurs — 
painstakingly reproduce this stuff 
by hand-crank mimeograph — col- 
late and assemble — address, and 
then mail out these minuscule publi- 
cations? 

Your guess would be as good as 
mine . , ‘ were it not that, well, gee, 
Fm a fanzine-publisher myself, and 
I Icnow. But the answers are easy. 
Lots of people suffer from the Crea- 
tive Itch, otherwise known as dat 
ole debbil The Urge for Self-Expres- 
sion. Joe or Jane Citizen’s itch may 
take the direction of cartooning of- 



fice characters in caricature, Sun- 
day pamting, would-be contributions 
to The Poet’s Corner in the local 
paper, or maybe even whacking 
away on that novel you’ve been 
puttering with ever since Junior 
year at college. 

In other words, we dabble. 

Then there’s the Good Old Ego- 
Drive. In science-fiction fandom, 
this basic human motivation takes 
the rationale of what you might 
well call small-pondism. That is, 
we’d rather be big frogs in a small 
pond (the fan world), than small 
frogs in big pond (the everyday, 
workaday world). Now through the 
medium of fanzines, your typical 
gawky adolescent, all elbows and 
acne, ignored by the local cutics and 
sniggered at by the high school foot- 
ball stars, can actually be an inter- 
national celebrity, noted bon vivant, 
wit and reconteur, famed as a 
scathing critic, literary figure mid 
popular personality ... in the minds 
of two or three hundred people, 
remember. 

No, I am not Resting. Fandon is 
just small enoufli for nearly my 
individual, with luck, initiative and 
a little stamina, to make a big 
enough splash in that little pond to 
become a genuine celebrity. Nor is 
“international” an exaggeration. 
Sure, fans dwell <mi both this and 
that side of the Atlantic — and 
Pacific. During my own fannish 
days, which, come to think, I am 
still going through, various lit’ry 
efforts of my own in the fan press 
stimuntted letters of comment and/ 
or compliment from Spain, Sweden, 
Ireland, India, Japan, Australia, etc.

IF 




And, after all — honest, now! — 
who wouldn’t rather be any kind of 
a Big Frog . since all but the 
luckiest of us have to be satisfied 
with being very small frogs indeed, 
in the everyday world? 

Ego-Drive, via the outlet of fan- 
zining, enables the school kid, the 
small-town clerk or accountant, the 
housewife, the frustrated writer in 
each of us, to air his or her ideas, 
opinions, tastes and talent for humor 
to a wide audience of other people 
who share a mutual interest in fan- 
tastic literature. Your dedicated SF 
fan is vitally interested in this 
month’s If, the latest George Pal 
movie, the newest paperback. He 
yearns to discuss their merits, or 
lack of same, with kindred souls. 
Fanzines are one way of doing this. 

But they can turn out to be an end 
unto themselves. To wit: 

Fanzines Carried to the Nth Degree: the APA 

N OW THE idea of the amateur 
press association, the club of 
amateur publishers, has been with 
us for nearly a century. There were 
several such already going strong 
when science-fiction fans stumbled 
on the concept. The first, called 
NAPA '(National Amateur Press 
Association), was launched way 
back around 1870. Then came 
a similar group, UAPA (United 
Amateur Etc. Etc.), about 1890. As 
the result of a contested election, a 
splinter-group broke off from the 
latter some years after its beginning. 
This splinter-group, rather confus- 
ingly also called LFAPA, is worthy 
of our attention in that at one point 



in its varied and, I have no doubt, 
colorful, career, its Official Editor 
(the late and great weird story 
writer, H.P. Lx)vecraft) was a lead- 
ing member, and published in 
UAPA magazines some of his ear- 
liest stories, before he began selling 
to Weird Tales. In fact, while still 
Official Editor, Ix)vecraft "married 
the splinter-United’s President, Sonia 
H. Greene. These were not fanzines 
in the science-fiction sense, of 
course, but sort of general, main- 
streamy literary mags. 

When fandom discovered the no- 
tion, FAPA {Fantasy Amateur You- 
Know-What) was bom. The fellow 
who initiated the concept into action 
was the Superfan of the day, Don- 
ald A. Wdlheim, who got the ball 
rolling in 1936. Wollheim, in those 
days the Fan’s Fan, has since gone 
on to professional science fiction — 
as an SF novelist, magazine editor, 
hardcover and paperback antholo- 
gist, and more recently, editor-in- 
chief of Ace Books. 

FAPA worked — and still works 
^ along the general lines of the 
other APAs. Each member, to stay 
a member, has to publish ‘umpty-’ 
leben pages of material each year 
(amount varies from APA to APA). 
These arc sent on to the hard-work- 
ing bloke who serves as Official Edi- 
tor (called OE). He assembles pack- 
ages of these magazines, one copy 
of each mag to each package, and 
forwards the packages on to the in- 
dividual members. 

When FAPA was launched thirty 
years ago, there were only twelve 
memibers on the rolls. Today, there 
are about sixty-five — phis some 



AN APA FOR EVERYONE 



77 




sixty other patient souls on the 
“waiting list,” hanging around until 
a current member folds his mimeo- 
graph like an Arab and silently 
steals away. (Stringent limits on 
membership hold the active member- 
ship at sixty-five. If you become 
inactive, i.e., don’t publish your 
umpty-leben pages yearly, you are 
dropped and waiting-lister #1 be- 
comes a full-fledged FAPAn.) 

Some time in the 1940’s disgrunt- 
led fan publishers Joe Schaumbur- 
ger & Friends in New Jersey, decid- 
ed to start their own FAPA, and to 
hell with the waiting-list. They call- 
ed theirs SAPS, in a daring change 
of name-style (Spectator Amateur 
Press Society). I don’t know whether 
SAPS is still in the running, but I 
can picture a major hazard of mem- 
bership: “Whatcha crankin’ that old 
mimeograph for, Joe?” (Proudly) 
“I’m a SAP!” 

New Directions in Fan Publishing: 
the Once-a-Week FAPAs 

T he habit of fanzine-publish- 
ing can become not only ad- 
dictive, but epidemic. And I doubt 
if the Salk Foundation and the 
Mayo Brothers put together could 
come up with a cure. Here’s what I 
mean. 

About two years ago a group of 
New York City fans, members of 
a ^roup bafflin^y yclept FISFA, de- 
cided to start their own APA — 
with this soul-searing idea: instead 
of only having to publish ‘umpty-’ 
leben pages per year, their APA 
would demand the same each ever- 
lovin' week. Guiding brains behind 



this historic concept were fans 
David G. Van Arnam and Ted 
White, I believe. Both have since 
become professional science-fiction 
novelists, but apparently without 
dampening their ardor for fannish 
publishing. 

They launched a group called 
APA F (the “F” stands for Fanoc- 
lasts, an NYC fan club from whom 
initial membership was drawn). 
APA F, still in there cranking the 
old mimeo-handle, currently distri- 
butes fifteen to thirty-odd fanzines 
each and every Friday. 

I hasten to reassure you these are 
very slim little magazines, not hun- 
dred-page titans, mostly just one or 
two pages per issue. 

As if this were not exhausting 
enough — just imagine having to 
sit down and read sixty-or-so pages 
of fannish material every blessed 
week of the year — a rival concern 
got started out on the West Coast, 
centering about Los Angeles. 

The Los Angelenos, under the 
aegis of APA-L, publish about the 
same number of these one or two- 
page fanzinettes. 

To make matters worse, if possi- 
ble, APA F and APA-L exchange 
weekly mailings. That means each 
member (unless he’s cheating) has 
to plow wearily through roughly one 
hundred and twenty pages of fan- 
nish writing every week. Let’s see, 
that’s about 480 pages every month 
. or somewhere in the neighbor- 
hood of five thousand eight hundred 
pages in a full year! The imagination 
boggles. Each year, then, our dogged 
APAist slogs wearily through a com- 
bined wordage equil to piling Pres-

cott’s Conquest of Mexico and Peru 
on top of Gibbons’ Decline and Pall 
of the Roman Empire, with Plut- 
arch’s complete Lives of the Noble 
Romans and the Noble Greeks Com- 
pared sandwiched in for comic re- 
lief. 

What's the Point of It All — If Any? 

I T MAKES you wonder, Ego- 
Drive and Creative Itch notwith- 
standing. is it all worth it? 

Well, by and large, I suppose you 
might say yes. 

In and out of FAPA over the 
years have been some of the most 
delightful people you’ll ever meet. 
And some of the most talented. 
Famed fan humorist Bob Tucker, 
for example, who writes detective 
stories and an occasional science- 
fiction novel under his more formal 
name — Wilson Tucker. And many 
another gifted personality went 
through a FAPA period, and often 
came out the other end to break 
out in a rash of published science- 
fiction novels. Authoress Marion 
Zimmer Bradley, whose byline has 
appeared on, I know not how many 
Ace releases, was — and, come to 
think of it, by golly, still is, a 
FAPAn in good standing. 

In fact, the ranks of the various 
amateur press associations have con- 
tributed any number of distinguished 
professional SF authors or editors 
to the Big Pond of the corner news- 
stand. Robert W. Lowndes, former 
editor of Science Fiction Stories and 
a whole satchel-full 6f other maga- 
zines, was a member of FAPA. And 
there’s Ace’s Don Wollheim, whom 



we have already mentioned. He was 
FAPA’s first President. And come 
to think of it, Ifs own editor, Fred 
Pohl, was one of the very earliest 
FAPA boys, long before he met 
Cyril Kornbluth and they teamed 
up to write The Space Merchants 
and Gladiator-at-Law and all those 
other books. ^ 

Glancing through a typical FAPA 
mailing, you will see.the ^ood and 
the bad. Many of the magazines are 
works of polished craftsmanship, 
impeccably mimeographed, technic- 
ally fascinating, displaying all sorts 
of experimentation such as multi- 
color mimeography and lavish use 
of on-stencil artwork. They present 
fine material, good stories, articles, 
anthology- worthy verse, witty re- 
views and features. 

Or they will be pedestrian beyond 
belief, a whole issue devoted to that 
Curse of the APA — the mailing 
comments. These are paragraph- 
long comments on other people’s 
magazines in the last FAPA mail- 
ing. This feature can grow like some 
insidious fungus, until it consumes 
the bulk of the entire issue . and 
believe me, there is nothing in this 
world duller to read* and of less per- 
manent value or interest than Joe 
Fan’s remarks on the last issue of 
Moe Fan’s fanzine. 

So What Good Are APAS, Anyway? 

W ELL, AMATEUR publishing 
does not always have to be- 
come an end to itself. Nine times 
out of ten it suffices to satisfy the 
good old Creative Itch. All our 
gawky adolescent or housewife or 



AN APA FOR EVERYONE

small-town accountant needs to sate 
his lust for Big-Frogism is the nar- 
cissistic bliss of reading Moc Fan’s 
praise of his latest FAPAzine. 

But about one time in ten, instead 
of lulling The Urge for Self Expres- 
sion, this little taste of Big-Frogism 
hones and excites it to the danger 
point. That’s the point at which Joe 
Fan comes to realize it might be 
worth a try. Why not buckle down 
and see if it is possible to be a Big 
Frog — in a Big Pond? 

At which critical juncture, usual- 
ly, he throws away his unused mi- 
meo stencils, drags out that half-done 
novel still left over from his Junior 
year at college, blows the dust off 
it and starts punishing the typewriter 
in earnest. 



Next issue, Our Man In Fan- 
dom takes a look at the most 
wideipread fan-aetivity of thom^ 
all — and one in which every 
science-fiction fan can partake — 
the Local Fan Club. Who knows, 
maybe you’ve been reading sci- 
ence fiction all thcce years — and 
all the time there was a lively 
club-full of people with similar 
interests right around the corner! 



After all . whafs he got to 
lose by trying? 

Beside his FAPA membership, 
that is. END

the young scholar he was dying 
purple. “This won’t take but a mo-

“No,” Dirk said, “it’s not too 
hot.” Stripped to his breech clout in 
the center of the courtyard, he was 
watching with awe as the warmth of 
the sun dried the liquid Otho tiie 
Captive dipped up with his rag and 
stick. Black when it came dripping 
out of Otho’s pot, it turned the 
smoothly taimed skin of Dirk’s bar- 
rel chest and long legs the color of 
wild grapes. 

They were alone in the court. 
The west wall, the only one not 
lined with mud-brick buildings, 
threw a shadow like the edge of a 
blade across the flagstones. Over the 
top of the wall, distant and misted 
and shadow-side to, Diiik could see 
the distant lift of the mountains.

For the thousandth time a phrase he 
had heard once from old Teophilus 
ran through his head: “The moun- 
tains are mice.” 

It was a comforting thought, but 
he felt sure Master Theophilus had 
not meant it to comfort. He had 
been thinking of stealth and disease 
and perhaps of other things as well. 

“The soles of your feet, please,” 
said Otho. 

Obediently Dirk held them up in 
turn for the fat man to splash his 
dye on. 

“I well remember, my lord,” Otho 
said chattily, “how unnecessary I 
thought this when it was done to 
me. I supposed it would be the 
first place to wear clean. But I found 
out, my lord, that when the feet are 
calloused — as mine were then and 
yours are now, my lord — they are 
one of the very last places. The mag- 
istrate found it between my toes and 
in the crevices of the thick skin when 
I was drug before him. I believe 
I’ve told you, my lord, that I was 
nearly clean when I was taken?” 

From the wall, a raven which had 
been perched with its back arrogant- 
ly toward them as it stared out over 
the desert suddenly launched itself 
thrashing into the air. Outlined for a 
moment like. a heraldic figure, black 
against the blaze of the afternoon 
sky, it brought to the young man a 
sudden personal realization of the 
frighteningly complex linkage be- 
tween cause and effect, stimulus and 
response, which guides every living 
creature. 

Above all others this was the 
concept his instructors had droned at 
him daily until he had almost 



learned to ignore it. Now, on the 
verge of the Great Retreat, he was 
beginning at last to understand the 
idea he had so often parroted. 

The raven croaked twice over 
their heads and then, with a desper- 
ate flapping of wings, settled on 
Otho’s shoulder. In astonishment 
Dirk searched the Captive's plump 
face for a hint of the understanding 
he would have seen, he knew, on 
that of Theophilus or any other 
Master at such a moment. There was 
only wonder and a kind of sheep- 
ishness. 

“He’s a pet, my lord,” Otho ex- 
plained hurriedly. “I took him from 
the nest two weeks ago, and I’ve kept 
him in my rooms almost ever since. 
This is only the second time he’s 
been out.” He stroked the bird un- 
der its ruffled bill with a pudgy fin- 
ger. “What ought I to call him, do 
you think?” 

“Corvus Corvax,” Dirk suggested 
drily. “I wish I knew what unsettled 
him like that.” 

“Oh, you will, my lord. When you 
come back to us you’ll be a Master 
yourself, and no one would believe 
some of the things I’ve seen my Mas- 
ter, Theophilus, do. Control all sorts 
of animals; summon the hawks from 
the sky, if you can credit it.” 

And so, Dirk thought, you steal 
fledglings to tame in immitation of 
him. Never mind. I’m closer to the 
fledgling stealing level myself. Aloud 
he said, “Nothing magical happens 
on the Retreat, Otho. If you almost 
completed it yourself you ought to 
know that.” 

“Ah, but I didn’t finish. That 
makes the difference.”

T he gate in the west wall, which 
was the rear entrance to the 
academy, opened unexpectedly, con- 
trary to the very explicit regulation 
that no freeman should observe a 
scholar who had undergone this 
degradation until he was actually in 
Retreat and subject to capture. 

For a few seconds Dirk and Otho 
saw an impressively tall man with 
a full beard and long, bound hair 
who sat a shaggy wild horse without 
saddle or bridle. His glance swept 
the courtyard like a scythe. Then 
the horse wheeled, revealing the 
slender barreled automatic rifle 
slung reversed over its master’s 
shoulders, and they were gone. 

Otho exclaimed, “It’s Master 
Aleksandr, come in! My lord, I 
must get something cooked for him 
— you are finished already, and you 
know where to wait. Heavens bless 
you, my lord!” 

The fat man was running toward 
the kitchen already with his tame 
bird fluttering after him. At least, 
Dirk reflected, he knew now what 
had disturbed it. 

The waiting place was a small 
room at the base of the round tower 
at the northwest corner of the acad- 
emy. It possessed a tiny door, a sort 
of sally-port, which opened directly 
to the outside. In order to reach it 
Dirk was forced to walk through 
several of the other academy build- 
ings. As he expected, the halls were 
deserted. Every door he did not 
need to use was tightly shut. 

The few possessions he would be 
allowed to take with him were al- 
ready in the room, packed in his 
shoulder-strapped specimen bag: a 



plainly made knife wkh a blade not 
much larger than the width of his 
hand, but of excellent steel; a leath- 
er water flask; bandages and a bottle 
of disinfectant; a small magnifying 
glass; a clasped handbook of med- 
itations with tables of useful infor- 
mation, formulas and recipes at the 
end. The whole collection, bag in- 
cluded, weighed less than two kilo- 
grams. 

There was no light in the room 
save what entered from a narrow fir- 
ing slit in the wall; but he seated 
himself crosslegged on the floor any- 
way, intending to read. Instead, he 
found himself turning the book end- 
lessly over and over in his hands 
while he thought of the mountains. 

He planned to go to the mountains 
as soon as his Retreat began, and he 
wondered if gray old Master Theo- 
philus, who could read volumes in a 
breath of wind, knew it and would 
try to prevent him. The mountains 
were dangerous for anyone, but for 
a Retreatant they were, pardoxical- 
ly, almost perfectly “safe.” And he 
could not endure the thought of 
ending his life like Otho, fetching 
water and sweeping floors for an- 
other man; turning glutton and petty 
thief because he had no longer any 
self respect to uphold. 

He crossed the room to the firing 
slit and stared out across the level 
desert, estimating that another four 
hours remained before dark. 

Seeing the uneven line of the 
mountains at the horizon he admit- 
ted to himself for the first time that 
he would not be going only to escape 
a lifetime of Captivity. TTie moun- 
tains themselves drew him. Loom-

ing mightiness across the desert — 
the promise of a world alien to all 
he had known from geological for- 
mations to climate, peopled with the 
odds and ends, the hangers-on and 
survivors, who had somehow en- 
dured there when the old order fell 
to hits. The original owners of the 
ground, he thought to himself. Still 
nosing about in the dark corners 
and plotting ways to stick the tom 
leaves back on to the calendar. 

He shivered, though the mud- 
walled room was hot. 

II 

T hey came for him when the last 
sunlight had left the sky. He 
heard them long before the door 
opened, the steady, careful tread of 
I^oophilus’s bare feet contrasting 
with the uneven shuffle of Ofho’s 
rope-soled sandles. 

Standing in the doorway with his 
back to what light there was, ThecK 
phih» delivered the ritual expiana- 
tiofi of the purpose and conditions 
erf the Retreat, half speaking, half 
diafttmg. Dirk could make out only 
his beard and white hair in the dim- 
ness. 

Wl»n the ritual was over and 
Dirk had made the proper response, 
Thoophilus siid in his normal voice, 
“Otho will take you to a place from 
which even in full daylight the walls 
of the academy cannot be seen. The 
Retreat proper begins at sunup.** 
Dirk picked up his bag and followed 
Otho out into the desert. 

The sand and stones were still 
warm under his feet, thou^ he 
knew that warmth would not last 



long. The high-pitched howl of one 
of the little desert wolves, a sound he 
had heard often while stretched on 
his cot in the dormitory, seemed 
friendly and familiar. 

“My lord,” Otho said softly, “this 
is the place.” 

Unexpectedly, the Captive thrust 
a stoppered bottle into his hands. 
Without the slightly obsequious note 
Dirk had always heard in his voice 
before, he said, “Tve Uked you ever 
since you came, boy, even though 
you were more severe with me than 
any of the others. Take this. As soon 
as it’s light spread it all over your- 
self. In half an hour it will have 
neutralized the dye and you can 
wipe off the whole mess with clean 
sand.” Before Dirk could recover 
from his astonishment the Captive 
bad turned to go, calling over his 
shoulder, “My own ^scovery. I had 
the dye formula, you know, and 
plenty of time for research, m never 
tell anyone.** 

With the uncaasy skill of a Mas- 
ter, like a puma suddenly disappear- 
ing behind some fold of ground 
hardly large enoufii to shelter a 
cactus wren, he was gone. 

Dirk called in astonishment, then 
anger, and finally in an agony of 
frustration. There wm no reply. 

The desert was Kt with the silvery 
gossamer radiance of die stars, and 
s3ent with an aknost unbearable 
hush. He would have freely sworn 
that if a grasshopper mouse were to 
dart from a hole a handred meters 
away he would both see and hear it. 
There was nothing. Heavy and in- 
finitely dishonorable, OdK>*s bottle 
weighed in his hand.

if he were to use the preparation, 
he reflected, he would be safe from 
capture for the length of his Retreat. 
He would need only to stay away 
from the Academy for the two 
months or so the dye normally re- 
quired to wear off completely. If he 
were to meet a freeman he would 
undoubtedly be taken for a young 
Master on a field trip. He might 
even go east to where the sleepy 
farms and agricultural towns nestled 
in their irrigated valley and steal or 
beg food and clothing. 

It was impossible, of course. 

It would mean living a lie for the 
remainder of his life — feeling infer- 
ior to every Captive failure of a 
slavey who had at least tried to play 
’■>v the rules. 



86 



IF 




S tooping to bring his gaze closer to 
the sand, he thought he could 
detect those slight dislocations of 
the wind-blown pattern which 
marked Otho’s trail. To keep the 
dye -remover ... or pour it out, was 
as unthinkable as using it. Otho, 
whose actions Dirk felt he could 
predict well from his knowledge of 
the man, would believe he had used 
it. Otho would wink slyly when no 
one was watching, would make little 
secret jokes and be just a shadow 
more than an equal when they were 
alone. Dirk hated the Captivity sys- 
tem which punished failure so brut- 
ally, but he realized that to become 
the captive of a Captive would solve 
nothing. 

Surprisingly, Otho had apparently 
not headed directly back toward the 
academy. The trail slanted off to 
the northeast in a series of con- 
volutions that threw it behind every 



speck of cover. To follow it by star- 
light was slow work even for an ac- 
ademically trained and field-exper- 
ienced tracker. For anyone else it 
would have been hopeless. 

Slipping across the desert with his 
eyes on the spoor, he failed to notice 
the minute pantomine being per- 
formed two hundred meters to his 
left until his attention was called to 
it by a sound — a gasping release 
of breath as though a man had 
been struck violently in the stomach. 
A figure which had been moving 
silently on a course parallel to his 
own had suddenly found itself sur- 
rounded by four smaller figures. 
There had been a brief flourish of 
action, the large figure moving with 
pantherish speed and {>ower but the 
smaller ones with the incredible 
swiftness of humming birds — 
seeming almost to disappear in one 
spot and reappear without lapse of

tune in anothn*. Then the larger 
figure slumped, emitting the gasp 
Dirk had heard. By the time he look- 
ed up there was no motion. 

The symmetrical smoothness of 
four heads might easily at such a 
distance have been that of four 
rounded stones, but he turned as 
surely as a compass needle and be- 
gan to trot straight toward them. 
There was a sound like a strip of 
cloth being tom, and a muzzle blast 
like a scarlet star sparkling before 
the third head. With a violent tug 
at the shoulder strap his bag leap- 
ed away from his side as he threw 
himself face down on the sand. The 
four rounded ‘‘stones’* vanished like 
soap bubbles. The long wait began. 

He drew his bag toward him, got 
out his knife, and discovered with 
relief that the bullet bad not broken 
Otho’s bottle. With the knife in 
his hand he watched with unwinking 
intensity his whole perimeter, listen- 
inig for the sconape of one red sand 
grain on another, knowing as he 
did so that the flitting forms who 
might be ckcling to approach him 
from behind would be more difficult 
to see or hear than any Master. 

A t the academy be had been 
taught to call them by their 
scientific name of Homo Gyrda, the 
latter word being (he knew) a Latin- 
Anglo-Saxon mongrel for an obso- 
lete unit of measure a little less 
than half the height of a man. Sup- 
posedly it was die average stature 
of those his parents had called the 
Poor People or the Pretty People 
when they told stories in tihe farm- 
house kitchen. 



Daylight came without an attack. 
A hawk, enormous-winged, sailed 
the updrafte the rising sun fathered 
when it struck the desert floor. Dick 
stood up stiffly, rubbing hislimbs. 

The gyrda would not stay this 
close to the academy by day, he 
felt certain. Trotting ahead, he found 
the scene of the struggle and read 
in the sand (by the lack of blurring 
where the four figures had lain) that 
they had left almost immediately 
after shooting at him. The' depth of 
the tracks and the fact that they 
formed two columns side by side 
showed that they were carrying off 
their prisoner; wise desert fighters 
kept to a single line in order to 
better conceal their numbers. 

He followed them all that day, 
spending the next night under a 
stone outcrop where his almost 
naked body was prevented from radi- 
ating its precious heat to the sky. 

By noon of the second day of his 
Retreat he was in the foothills and 
had lost the trail in the rocks. He 
was hungry too, and knew diat he 
should not risk another night with- 
out food. A straggling mesquite 
tree offered him some shelter from 
the sun while he read what in- 
formation he could from it: the di- 
rection of the prevailing winds, that 
there was iron in the soil, .the length 
of the growing season and so on 
— reflecting that Theophilus or, he 
supposed. Master Aleksandr would 
have understood much more. 

Then he noticed that no mesquite 
beans lay under it. 

A pile of rocks about thirty meters 
off had a spot which appeared 



88 



IF 




more pounded and compacted than 
usual in front of every good sized 
crevice . marmots. Occasionally 
the little animals could be dug out, 
but a stroll around the rock pile 
convinced him that this fortress was 
too extensive and composed of stones 
too large for one man to handle. A 
glance overhead confirmed that the 
inevitable hawk was circling almost 
too high to be seen. Resuming his 
seat under the tree, he remained 
motionless for about twenty minutes, 
and then began to imitate the shrill 
whistle of an infant marmot in dis- 
tress. 

For several long breaths nothing 
stirred. He closed the hand out of 
sight of the rock pile on a stone. 
The nose of a small creature appear- 
ed in one of the crevices, then van- 
ished again. He whistled weakly. The 
marmot made a rush that took it 
not more than fifty centimeters from 
the rock pile, then scurried back. 
After another three minutes it came 
out again. Two meters, then three, 
from safety. 

Then he threw his stone. Not at 
the marmot, which would have been 
almost certainly futile at that range; 
but at the hole from which the little 
animal had come, to frighten it yet 
further away. 

The hawk came down like a bullet, 
seeming to split the thin air in his 
descent, yet the marmot was within 
two jumps of its hole when the 
talons seized it. It squealed piercingly 
once before it went limp. Dick yelled 
and pelted the hawk with a handful 
of gravel, at which the bird of prey 
wheeled to face him, hissing and 
clacking its curved beak. With a stick 



wrenched from the mesquite he was 
finally able to drive it off, flopping 
furiously along the ground. Like all 
birds it had great difficulty in rising 
unless it could climb to a tree limb 
or a high point of rock for its take- 
off. 

Dirk skinned the marmot and 
roasted it over a very economical 
fire of mesquite, considering his 
situation as he did so. He knew very 
little, really, about the gyrda, and 
neither where they lived nor what 
they lived on. Their reasons for 
capturing Otho he could only guess 
at. 

For the time being it seemed 
reasonable to assume that he had 
merely blundered into a party of 
scouts who had welcomed the op- 
portunity to take a prisoner. The 
problem now was to discover the 
trail again. 

Although the four Poor People 
had probably been carrying water 
bottles of some sort wkem they cap- 
tured Otho, he reflocicd, the supply 
could hardly be an^le. Before he 
had lost the trail ht had seen signs 
that indicated the Captive — who 
aippeared to have lost his sandal 
in the scuffle — was slowing the 
party down. If water consumption 
were proportional to body weight he 
would noed as much as three of his 
captors. Yet if they wanted to keep 
him alive in the desert they would 
have to supply him. Somewhere near 
here, then, they had almost cer- 
tainly replenished their canteens at 
some source known to them. He 
set out to discover the place and find 
Otho, knowing that it would be a 
very difficult task.

I t took him three days. To dis- 
cover surface water in these arid 
lands required a knowledge of geo- 
logy and a sensitive eye for slight 
differences in the lushness of 
growth and frequency in occurence 
of the comman desert plants. 

Dirk possessed both. But both 
had to be honed considerably be- 
fore he found the spot where a 
hole scooped in the sand had pro- 
duced a seepage of water for the 
gyrda and their prisoner. He filled 
his own flask and took up the now 
fading trail. 

He strode up long, slanted gullies 
filled with stones. In the desert and 
the flat plowlands the country had 
lain out wide around him with a 
feeling of spaciousness and natural 
or man-created orderliness. Be- 
cause he had himself been taller 
than most of the objects surround- 
ing him it had not prepared him 
for the high places, where fields a 
thousand hectares in extent stretch- 
ed up on either side of the V-point 
in which he walked. Long after 
night came, the light played on 
the raw rac)c at the peaks of the 
mountains. 

He did not suffer under the dis- 
advantages of those who have been 
taught that a human being must 
eat every day, ‘much less three times 
daily. His parents had regularly 
done without food one day a week 
during the winter, and at the acade- 
my his instructors had routinely 
taught their students the benefits 
of fasting. He knew how little and 
how much, a man needed to live. 



When they presented themselves 
he ate the roots of certain plants 
and used his knife to cut away the 
spine- studded skins of others to eat 
the pulp. Twice he was able to find 
and raze the little storehouses of 
kangeroo rats, masticating the 
tough, dry seeds they contained un- 
til they were a sweetish paste be- 
fore he swallowed. 

The trail ended at last in a sun- 
ken bowl wedged between three 
great peaks. Fifteen dome4 huts of 
flat stones surrounded that rarest 
of natural wonders, a deep pool 
of standing water. Outside of the 
little circle ranged “gardens” where 
most of the desert plants capable 
of furnishing some article of food 
to gatherers were being grown un- 
der cultivation. 

From a sheltered spot high up 
the slope of one of the enclosing 
mountains he watched the life of 
the village all the remainder of the 
day, but he could get no clue to 
the prisoner’s whereabouts until it 
was nearly dark. Then a lone in- 
dividual appeared, carrying le of 
the long rods he knew weif^.. ^vea- 
pons, and a small jug and hide bag. 

He left one of the huts and be- 
gan flitting up an almost invisible 
path nearly opposite from his po- 
sition. After perhaps a minute two 
others followed him, unarmed, and 
— so it seemed to Dirk — with the 
negligent air of gawkers everywhere. 
The mountainside on which he was 
hidden was already in shadow al- 
though the three climbing gyrda were 
still sunlit, so he wasted no time in 
beginning the long trek around to 
where the path lay fine as cobweb 



90 



IP 




against Uie mountain. As he had 
anticipated, the gyrda were back in 
their village and only starlight lit 
the path long before he reached it. 

In many places it consisted of no 
more than a series of hand and 
foot holds, and his few days in the 
high country had by no means given 
him the true mountaineer’s immuni- 
ty to acrophobia. Hours elapsed be- 
tween the time he reached the path 
and his last scramble to the sum- 
mit. 

He had naively imagined that the 
peak of one of the mountains which 
appeared so pointed when seen from 
below would actually be sharp, a 
column or pyramid of rock. In truth 
it was nearly flat, a table-top of red 
sandstone about fifty meters by a 
hundred with a barely perceptible 
tilt. In the center of this barren 
little plateau a single verticle stratum 
of rock rose to about the height 
of a man, as though a coin on edge 
had been embedded deeply in the 
stone. Only when the upper edge 
of this moved slightly did he re- 
alize that a living being was lying 
along it. He walked silently, crouch- 
ing, but he had taken only a few 
steps when a calm voice said, “Walk 
wide of the pile of stones to your 
left.” 

H e straightened up. The voice 
continued, “I am chained here. 
Who are you? I’ve been listening 
to your climbing half the night.” 
“The retreatant you saw being 
stained when you came to our aca- 
demy six days ago. Master Aleksan- 
dr. I had thought to find Otho, 
Master Theophilus’s Captive, here.” 



He was close enough now to see the 
bearded, intense face well with the 
starlight full on it. Master Aleksandr 
was chained on his back, so that his. 
face — when his neck was not 
craned to watch Dirk — was to the 
sky. 

“You needn’t worry about Otho; 
he is safe in his bed back a^ the 
academy, I trust. I was worried about 
you two though, when Master Theo- 
philus told me you would be starting 
the Great Retreat that night. And so 
I followed you.” 

There was a faint clinking of iron 
as the Master shifted in what Dirk 
knew must be a torturously uncom- 
fortable position before he con- 
tinued. 

“I had learned the gyrda were 
sending patrols closer than ever be- 
fore to the academy. That was what 
I had come to tell Theophilus, but 
I wandered into one myself. Your 
name is Dirk, is it not? Theophilus 
mentioned it over dinner that night. 
Do you see how I am bound, Dirk?” 

Dirk paused before answering, 
uncertain of his vision in the dim 
light. “I believe a hole has been 
drilled through that outcrop and a 
chain connecting your wrists runs 
through it. May I touch them?” 

Master Aleksandr nodded. 

“They are welded, sir.” 

”I know. Can you think of any 
way to cut them?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Neither can I, and I’ve been 
trying for two days — ever since 
they put me up here. We’ll have to 
part the stone instead. I assume you 
have the usual Retreat Knife. Try it 
on the stone.”

For some minutes there was no 
sound save the gritty rasp of the 
steel edge on sandstone. At length 
Dirk reported, ‘*It will cut a bit, but 
I think it would take a month to 
wear through from the edge to where 
the chain goes through; it must be 
sixty or seventy centimeters.” 

“Look there,” the chained man ex- 
claimed suddenly, “just on the hori- 
zon. Can you fellow my line of 
sight, Dirk?” 

Dirk asked doubtfully, “The blue 
star?” 

Master Aleksandr laughted softly. 
“It’s a planet, and it’s what they’ve 
stuck me up here to see, so you 
can’t blame me for getting a little 
excited when it rises. Technically I 
shouldn’t even point it out to you 
until you finish Retreat. 

“Now,” his voice hardened, “feel 
the stone under me just above niy 
waist. You may want to use the 
point of your knife. Feel a little 
crack?” 

After a moment Dirk nodded. 

CC/^ood. I only saw it as a dark 

^J^Hne when they were chaining 
me up here. Now I want you to go 
about ten centimeters up, under the 
small of my back, and try to gouge 
out a deep, narrow hole with your 
knife. I’ll pull myself away from 
the rock as far as I can.” 

After Dirk had worked for about 
ten minutes, the Master asked almost 
casually, “Making any progress?” 

“A little. Sir. Would it be im- 
pertinent to ask what it is we’re 
trying to do?” 

“Not at all. Have you ever read 
about Hannibal splitting stones with 



vinegar to clear the passes when he 
crossed the Alps? No, I forgot, you 
would never have heard of Hannibal. 
Anyway, he split the rocks with 
vinegar, according to Livy, and it’s 
puzzled a lot of historians since that 
time.” 

Master Aleksandr fell silent; Dirk 
had already come to realize that his 
mind was beginning to wander under 
the strain of the past six days. He 
said softly, “Vinegar, sir?” 

“Not surprising when you once 
come to understand that vinegar 
is a frequent mistranslation of the 
word ua^ to designate the »our 
red wine that was the usual drink 
of soldiers — of all the common 
people in those days, in fact. The 
liquid an army would have in plen- 
ty. Handy, in other words.” Holding 
himself tautly away from the stone 
and Dirk’s hands, he was no longer 
looking at Dirk. His eyes seamed 
to be following the blue planet as it 
rose slowly above the horizon. “It’s 
an old trick, much older than ex- 
plosivm as I’ve said. Drill a hole 
vertically or nearly so; a line of holes 
if the atone is thick. Drive in a peg 
of hard, dry wood — a tight wring- 
ing fit. Cut away the top of the peg 
until it’s below the level of the 
stone. Do you understand so far?” 

Dirk nodded. 

“Pour in wine, vinegar, water, 
whatever you have. It will penetrate 
the cells of the wood and cause them 
to swell. The pressure is enormous: 
hundreds of kilos per square centi- 
meter, depending on the wood. Stone 
has great compressive strength but 
not much tensile and it’s brittle. It 
cracks.”

D irk could not get the ihole deep 
enough that night. 

He went over the far side of the 
plateau (the descent was actually 
easier on that side) when a gyrda 
from the village below came up with 
Master Aleksandr’s morning food 
and water. The sun stood squarely 
overhead when he finished pounding 
in the stake he had whittled from a 
limb of a dead tree half way down 
the mountain’s slope. 

“Near that little cairn of stones,” 
Master Aleksandr directed him 
weakly, “you’ll find a shallow dish 
with a little water in it. I saw the 
gyrda refill it this morning from the 
bottle he carried. Use that to pour on 
the peg. We’ll need what’s in the flask 
for ourselves. But be careful about 
getting it. Keep your eyes open.” 
Masters, as Dirk h^ leaned at 
the academy, did not usually bother 
to warn mere scholars unless the 
dangers or discomforts at hand were 
very great. Every nerve was alert as 
he approached the cairn. “I see the 
dish. Master Aleksandra, and an 
egg — a rock pigeon’s.” 

“The sun’s high now. Look in 
shade.” 

Not until the third time Dirk 
ran his eyes over the ground did he 
see it, and then he was astonished 
that he had not seen it at once. It 
was a lizard, legless or nearly so, 
whose Wack body was nearly two 
meters long though no thicker than 
a man’s wrist. Its absolute motion- 
lessness as it lay in the shadow of 
a small ledge of rock had made fakn 
pass over it repeatedly. 



*Tve had it under control ever 
since they put me up here, but I 
doubt if I could hold it if you were 
to step on it or kick a stone at it. 
With the simpler animals reflex ac- 
tion is hard to stop.” 

“I know,” Dirk said shortly. He 
was, after all, a Retreatant and^not 
a freshman scholar. “Is it so dan- 
gerous, then? I’ve never seen one 
like it before.” 

“It’s a hamadryad. At least that’s 
the best identification we’ve been 
able to make from the archives. It 
wouldn’t be in your texts at the 
academy because it isn’t one of our 
animals; this is one of the few the 
gyrda seem to be responsible for.” 

“I don’t understand this,” Dirk 
said slowly as he trickled water 
from the hamadryad’s dish into the 
hole above the peg top. “It seems 
to be the sort of thing we were al- 
ways told would be explained when 
we had made our Great Retreat. 
Weren’t all the animals from the 
Motherworld brought in the arcship? 
I’ve sometimes wondered if the in- 
structors weren’t holding something 
back.” 

“There’s no secret. It’s just that 
there are so many things for an 
undergraduate to learn about our 
own world — Mars — that we try to 
discourage you from getting started 
on the endless succession of inquiries 
about the Motherworld until we’re 
certain we’re not wasting our time 
on someone who’ll spend the rest of 
his life planting maguey. You know 
at least that mankind did not origi- 
nate on this planet, judging from 
what you’ve just said. Some of the 
boys who come to the academy from 



MOUNTAINS LIKE MICE

farms don’t even seem to realize 
that.” 

With sudden insight Dirk realized 
that Master Aleksandr was trying to 
spare them both at least part of the 
agony of suspense they must suffer 
during the hours of waiting for the 
moisture to penetrate the dense wood 
of the peg, but he did not care. 
The chance to hear a Master speak 
at length about the tangled paths of 
the lost race of Man had never be- 
fore come to him. And if he failed 
his retreat by capture or death, it 
would never come again. 

4CT '^^ve heard it,” he said cau- 
JL tiously. “My father used to 
say too that if you looked into the 
sky at night you could see the 
Motherworld, but I thought it was 
just a fable, like saying you couM 
hear the bees of summer when you 
put a hollowed out gourd to your 
ear on a winter evening.” 

“Could your father read, Dirk?” 
“He used to say he could, a little. 
I don’t really think so.” 

“Well, your great-grandfathers — 
all of them — were among the best 
educated men on the Motherworld. 
I can say that without knowing your 
family at all, because it’s true of 
every human being on Mars. Besides 
the language and literature they 
knew a good deal about every sci- 
ence and each of them was expert 
in at least two. Or they wouldn’t 
have been allowed to come. When 
the Mars stations were abandoned 
by the Motherworld they found 
themselves at the edge of starvation 
on a world where the maximum ex- 
ertions of every member of the 



community were barely able to sup- 
port life.” 

“But if they knew all those things 
. .” Dirk began weakly. 

“Most of it wasn’t worth a hand- 
ful of sand then. They couldn’t af- 
ford mathematics or astronomy or 
a lot of the other sciences that were 
of no immediate value in the pro- 
duction of food. Then there were 
a lot of disciplines that lost their 
utility when their equipment wore 
out, because there was no material 
for replacements except native iron 
and what could be saWaped from 
the things previously junked. And 
there was precious little energy to 
smelt and work either of them. They 
had nuclear phvsicists, but what 
good were they when Mars’s fission- 
ables had turned to lead eons ago?” 
Master Aleksandr shoiak his head 
as though to clear it. “Dirk, can you 
give me a drink from your flask? 
I’m getting very dry.” 

Dirk tilted the flask up, noticing 
as he did it how drawn the older 
man’s face looked and that he took 
only one swallow of the water. 

Master Aleksandr began again, 
“That’s the Motherworld, that you 
saw last night. That blue star. The 
gyrda chained me up so I would have 
to watch it all night. I imagine 
they’ve done this to quite a few 
people who didn’t have the least idea 
of what it was they were supposed 
to be seeing.” 

“I still don’t understand,” Dirk 
said. 

“The life sciences remained. In 
fact, that’s us. Metallurgy sunk back 
to blacksmithing. but botany and 
zoology and biology — the whole

IF 




study of the biosphere — were need- 
ed as never before, as well as geology 
for the location of water and what 
minerals there were. Fortunately, be- 
fore the Motherworld abandoned us 
an attempt had been made to trans- 
fer a viable desert ecology from 
there. That’s how we got most of the 
plants we have, as well as the birds 
and mammals. But not all the 
Motherworld’s fauna were trans- 
ferred as you seem to believe. A 
great many could not possibly have 
lived here, and a great many others, 
like the hamadryad, were just not 
wanted.” 

“You said the hamadryad was one 
of the gvrd’s animals. I don’t follow 
that; and why did they put it up 
here with you?” 

“As a watchdog. And for most 
of their prisoners — probably every- 
one they had before myself — he 
made an ideal gyard. Both frighten- 
ing and genuinely dangerous. He 
needs very little water and food, and 
he couldn’t leave the plateau even 
if he wanted to; he couldn’t make, 
some of the climbs. Of course he 
has to crawl into a crevice shortly 
after the sun sets to keep from freez- 
ing, but I doubt if the other prison- 
ers ever realized that.” 

“I didn’t, find it very frightening,” 
Dirk remarked. 

“If you had been a prisoner 
they’d have let you see him kill a 
wolf before they chained you up. 
Now look behind you.” 

Turning, Dirk saw the hamadryad 
some three meters behind him with 
half its body lifted from the ground 
and erect as a candle. Its neck had 
spread and flattened into a shape 



indescribably sinister. Its gaze was 
fixed not upon himself but on Mas- 
ter Aleksandr with an expression 
both attentive and, in an utterly 
alien fashion, intelligent. 

“They call them cobra de capello 
on the Motherworld,” AJeksandra 
said. ‘Snakes of the cape.’ The gyrda 
studied the old records ancf then 
rearranged the DNA of some harm- 
less reptile to produce ’it. Clever of 
them, wasn’t it? 

“Now see if there’s a new crack 
in this rock. I think I just heard 
something.” 

V 

Ci'^X^he mountains are mice,” old 
JL Theophilus said ruminatively. 
“Yes. I believe I did tell your class 
something like that once. I meant 
to allude to mice as experimental 
animals, of course; the mountains 
have been injected with all the 
viruses and vaccines.” 

Dirk was scratching the spot on 
his arm which he had, on Master 
Theophilus’s explicit order, swabbed 
with Otho’s dye remover. It was 
beginning to itch. 

“Like the gyrda?” he asked. 

“Yes. The gyrda were devised on 
the Motherworld to be the perma- 
nent settlers of Mars while our fore- 
fathers were serving as investigators 
and observers. Couples who des- 
perately needed money, as well as a 
few who felt they were advancing 
the human race, submitted to having 
their reproductive cells mutated. It 
seems strange to us who think only 
of the richness of the old Mother- 
world, Dirk, but there were many

IF • Short Story 



GOLDEN TRABANT 

by R. A. LAFFERTY 



Where did the gold come from? 
More important — what was the 
thing that brought it to Earth? 



T he man who entered, though 
quiet and soft-stepping, was 
none of your tame animals. He’d 
kill for the one thing he wanted and 
couldn’t get enough of; but he hard- 
ly knew what to do with the packet 
of it he had under his arm. The man 
had a slight green tinge to him, and 
Patrick T. K. guessed that what he 
carried would have it also. 

In an earlier era the man would 
have been tagged immediately as a 
seaman. Plainly he was still that, but 
of a more ethereal sea. Under his 
arm he had a package wrapped in 
newspaper, and more sturdily wrap- 
ped beneath. It was not a large 
package, but it was quite heavy. 

The faring man was slim but 
amazingly wiry. Patrick T. K. was 
fat but with a lean and hungry eye 
that couldn’t be fooled. Patrick set 
the weight of the package carried by 



the man at a hundred and twenty 
pounds. 

If it were iron of such bulk it 
would weigh hardly a third that. If 
it were lead it would not be that 
heavy. Patrick studied the tendons 
on the side of the man’s neck and 
the bulging veins on the back of his 
hand. He studied the set of his feet 
as he stood there, and he calculated 
the man’s center of gravity, package 
included. Mercury would not be that 
heavy. Platinum would be heavier 
by a tenth. Patrick T. K. sometimes 
made mistakes in his judgment, but 
he never made mistakes by as much 
as ten per cent. 

So the seaman had a lump of 
gold to sell him. 

Nothing unusual about that. Pat- 
rick T. K. bought more sly gold than 
anyone in town. 

“I’ve been told,” said the sea- 



97 




man, “and it doesn’t matter by 
whom, that you might be able to 
give me good cash for what I have 
here. But I won’t be beaten down. 
I know my price.” 

“And I know mine,” said Paddy 
T. K. “Twenty thousand dollars. 
How do you want it? Well, come, 
come how? Twenties, fifties, hun- 
dreds, thousands or a king’s mix- 
ture?” 

“I had priced it a little higher,” 
said the man. 

“What? For that undersized loaf 
of bread under your arm? Two 
hundred dollars a pound for a hun- 
dred pounds is as close as I can 
figure.” 

“It weighs more.” 

“I know what it weighs. But I like 
to use round figures.” 

“Shall I unwrap it here? Have you 
a place to test it?” 

“Leave it wrapped. Here is the 
sum. And if you find it short a bill 
or two, be assured it is a dishonest 
mistake.” 

“There is more where this comes 
from.” 

“I can take this much every two 
weeks. Now be off.” 

“You’re not going to look at it? 
How can you be sure what it is?” 

“I have X-ray eyes.” 

“Oh.” . 

B ut when Paddy T. K. was alone 
he put other things away and 
locked the door. He took the pack- 
age to a back room, puffing heav- 
ily, for it was just as heavy as he 
knew it must be. He unwrapped it 
There was little that Patrick did 
not know about gold. He knew the 



greenishness of African gold, wheth- 
er of the Gold Coast or the South; 
the greasiness of Kolyma gold and 
also its extreme unavailability; the 
cypric tinge of Sierra Madre gold 
whether from the Guatemala or 
Mexico district. He was familiar with 
the sudden brightness of Milne Bay 
gold, with the granularity of the 
Canadian, the muscle-like texture of 
that of Witwatersrand, the lightness 
of color of the gold ^of California 
and nearby Sonora, and the white 
gold (almost Electrum) of New 
Guinea above Milne Bay. 

This was none of them. It was 
raw but fine, and very, very slightly 
cupric. The green tint in it was about 
the same as that in the complexion 
of the man. Patrick set down the 
weight in a notebook. And at the 
column for the origin he did not 
hesitate. He wrote down ‘Extrater- 
restrial*. 

That was the first written note of 
the thing. 

Later, this gold would be known 
as St. Simeon gold (from a station 
on its route, not from its origin), 
but Patrick T. K., the old jewel^ 
factor and sly gold dealer, was not 
fooled. 

Within a month, the Wall Street 
Journal had also referred to the new 
gold as extraterrestrial. The boys on 
that sheet also knew about gold, 
wherever they got their knowledge. 
But the Journal was derided for its 
correct guess. Gold cargo had never 
been authorized. No such gold had 
been mined except for pilot digs in 
conjunction with other operations. 
The cost would have been prohibi- 
tive, considering the cargo of neces- 



98 



IF 




sary production machinery and the 
rudimentary state of exploration and 
the rarity of any solid finds. Off- 
Earth gold was still a generation 
away. 

I t was a four-man corporation 
made up of: Robert Fountain, an 
unobstruct^ genius; George Grinder, 
a ruthless ruffian; Carlos Trevino, 
the last of the Conquistadores and 
perhaps the first of a new kind of 
man; and Arpad Szild, a murderous 
Irishman who used a dead man’s pa- 
pers and a dead man’s name. 

Three of them had been dining in 
quiet luxury one evening at Tre- 
vino’s when Szild appeared in the 
midst of them, “the doors and win- 
dows being closed,’’ as Fountain re- 
lated it with his biting humor, but 
that part of it may not be true. 

“I’ve been there. I can take you 
to it,” Szild said suddenly. He sat 
down and began to eat with his hands 
from the bowls. 

“I grind up better stuff than yoo 
for feed supplement for my cattle,” 
Trevino said. ”Who are you? What 
can you take us to?” 

‘To the Trabant You were talk- 
ing about the legend.” 

“All right. You talk about the 
legend, real fast,” Robert Fountain 
said. “You haven’t much time.” He 
laid a hog-nosed gun in front of him 
on the table. 

“It’s shaped like a balk or a beam,” 
Szild said. “Its greater diameter is 
twenty-five hundred meters, and its 
lesser is fifteen hundred — a little 
less than two cubic miles. It’s a mis- 
shapen tapered beam or egg with a 
cleft at its minor end. Its rotation is 



a tumble, and the period of the tum- 
ble is just short of thirty minutes. 
It’s as bad-natured a rock as can be 
found. Cuts you to pieces. Shouldn’t 
have an atmosphere, but there’s 
something that tears up your lungs 
no matter how you’re suited. It’s an 
angry place, I tell you. But it’s, gold.” 

That was the Golden Trabant, one 
of the smaller of the eighteen hun- 
dred significant asteroids orbiting be- 
tween Mars and Jupiter. When final- 
ly charted several years after this, 
it would be given the noxious name 
Venenatus — but that was after it 
had been treated and its nature 
changed. 

“We have a nice sketchy catalog 
of every asteroid down to about that 
size,” said Grinder. “Nobody knows 
much about their details, but they 
are numbered and given their rela- 
tive positions and speeds in the as- 
teroid stream. Can you tell us which 
it isr 

“Can. Won’t,” said Szild. ”But PU 
take you there.” 

Szild had known that he would 
have to play his ace on the fmt 
round. After he had taken them to 
It, they would have no reason to 
keep him alive: but he had gambled 
his life before. 

He said he had been there and 
knew where it was. The odds were 
high enough for them to take a 
chance on believing him. They ac- 
quired a ship and mounted a flight. 

The ship was old and had been 
deactivated. Carlos Trevino bought 
it at surplus and had it towed down 
by tug and beached at a remote spot 
on the holdings of the Trevino fam- 
ily. It was activated by the genius

of Fountain and the driving energy 
of Grinder. They took twelve young 
Hispanic technicians, none of whom 
are alive to give their versions. They 
hadn't known what they would run 
into nor what the labor would be at 
breaking up and loading the cargo. 
They went up, and they loaded the 
cargo. 

They came back, the four of them 
without the twelve young techni- 
cians. Their first cargo. A trip of 
only five weeks. The Trabant was 
not distant. 

S zild showed an exceptional talent 
at remaining alive. It is hard to 
kill a man as tough and canny as 
he, one who is never off guard. He 
spent the two weeks of the return 
barricaded in a little compartment, 
and the three leaders had to postpone 
Szild’s killing till their earthing. Szild 
knew that they had mostly delegated 
such jobs as that. He himself had 
had to kill the twelve young techni- 
cians for them. 

He bulled his way out when they 
were busy with ear^all and secure 
landing. 

“He can’t get away,” Trevino 
said. 

He couldn’t get clear of the sur- 
rounding jungle; he did. Trevino who 
knew his own land minutely could 
track Szild down; he couldn’t He 
couldn’t take much with him; he 
took a hundred and twenty pounds 
of it. That wasn’t much out of a 
cargo like theirs, and whatever story 
Szild might tell would not be believ- 
ed. He had no reason to t^ any 
story at all; he didn’t. 

But somehow he reached port 



and took passage to the North, for 
Szild was the man who sold that 
first lump of gold to Patrick T. K. 

Another man would have been 
satisfied with that and steered clear 
of them. Not Szild. Nevertheless, 
they were surprised when he return- 
ed to them just at second take-off 
time, as they were going now with 
a ship that was really a ship. He 
came on foot across the savanna 
from the inland side. 

“ ‘Something like this ' happens 
every time I leave the house for a 
minute,’ as the woman said as she 
examined the mandible and two pa- 
rietal bones of her newly eaten 
child,’’ Szild greeted them. “Would 
you be going without me? The news 
I had of you was sketchy and I am 
barely here in time.” 

“Kill him!” said Robert Foimtain. 

“Kill him. Fountain says, and the 
other two look at each other. Was 
it not better. Fountain, to have a 
man who will kill when you say kill, 
and avoid these awkward pauses? 
But I kill hard. Fountain. I go as 
long as anybody goes, and after- 
wards.” 

Szild went with them. They would 
kill him after the hard work of load- 
ing was done. They would kill him 
after he had done his turn at the 
instruments out and back. By and 
by they would kill him. 

They brought back two hundred 
tons on that second voyage. They 
made a third voyage and a fourth 
and a fifth. 

T he establishment of the Com- 
monwealth of San Simeon did 
not shake the world. Not at Hrst 



100 



IP 




Nobody had ever heard of the place. 
It seemed a prank. Possibly a name 
given to a rebel hold. 

Yet the Commonwealth was re- 
cognized that first day by its two 
adjacent Central American neigh- 
bors They constituted themselves co- 
protectors of the new country. One 
of them, indeed, had ceded the land 
for it, the ancient and run-down 
rancho of the Trevino family. Some 
consideration had surely been paid 
for this protection. 

It was soon after this that the 
heavy San Simeon Duros (fifty dol- 
lar gold pieces) began to appear 
around the world. 

The appearance of these Duros 
caused a nervousness all out of pro- 
portion to the number of them. It 
is possible that not more than twen- 
ty million of them (that is, a billion 
dollars’ worth) went into circulation 
that first year. That is a large 
amount coming from a new small 
country, but it shouldn’t be enough 
to unhinge the world. Yet it did al- 
most that. 

Gold had gotten out of the habit 
of showing itself in society. For years 
it had sat at home in vaults, and a 
multiplier had been used to equate 
it with credit money. Nobody knew 
what to make of naked gold return- 
ing to the market. And what if this 
stream should be but the beginning 
of a veritable river? 

And the stream was spreading. 
Three Central Americans countries 
were on a gold spree. It was slop- 
ping over into others. 

The mystery of San Simeon was 
not solved. The exact location of the 
country was unknown to the world 



at large. Its form of government was 
not to be ascertained. Its statistics 
softened and disappeared when ex- 
. amined. It had a president, Fuentes. 
It had a prime minister, Molinero — 
the miller, the grinder. It had a for- 
eign minister Trevino. It had the 
hardest currency in the world. Its 
national game was playing hob with 
the currencies *of the rest of the 
world. 

If one small shrew is put into a 
warren of 'mice or rats> it causes 
panic. The shrew is smaller than any 
of them and it may be one against 
hundreds. But it will eat them; it 
will eat them alive. And given time, 
it will cat them all. 

Something like this happened to 
the green money, the white money, 
the rainbow-colored money of the 
world. Token shrivels before the 
thing itself. It could not stand up to 
free and growing gold. 

But if the warren is big enough, 
the shrew can be contained. There 
will be some of the rats knowing 
and political enough to go out and 
hire shrews of their own. The source 
of the gold stream could not be hid- 
den forever. 

One thing (Szild always said it 
was a mistake and Robert Fountain 
agreed that it was, but they couldn’t 
hold the other two in line) was that 
the first ships begat others. Trevino 
and Grinder Molinero became too 
hasty in their greed. In that second 
year they had twelve ships in the 
service instead of one. That meant 
that somewhere between fifty and a 
hundrd men knew the source. 

The shores began to cave. The 
golden stream was a river. It crest- 



GOLDEN TRABANT 



101 




ed to a torrent. One ship defected, 
then another. They came back to 
Earth in other lands than those of 
their departure. And wherever they 
came down they spawned other 
ships. 

A dozen other countries were in 
the race by the third year. Now 
there was privateering and open pi- 
racy. The ships became battle boats, 
death spheres, and the attrition was 
terrifying. But the inward flood of 
the metal continued. 

The world importation by the 
fourth year had risen to five hun- 
dred billion dollars annually, if it 
could any longer be equated in dol- 
lars. The gold dollar itself was not 
as hard as it had been. 

The Trabant had changed. The 
period of its tumble was now only 
twenty-three minutes. The egg had 
been cracked and gutted in many 
places, and the cleft at the minor 
end had become a chasm between 
two horns. There was a project to 
shear off one of the horns and tow 
it to Earth in hunks of a million 
cubic yards each. This would be a 
lot of gold. 

I t was time for oblique measures, 
and they were found. The effect 
of the gold on the world had not 
really been bad. The effect on most 
people had been* marvelous. But there 
was a small group that had always 
borne the burden of currency deci- 
sions. They were made nervous by 
this unbridled activity. Their hold 
was slipping. They took measures. 

A small commission of not overly 
intelligent men found an answer. In 
their own field they understood 

102 



cause and effect. They acted on 
doubtful authority, and they were 
not of one mind about the action. 
But they did it. 

They killed Trabant. 

One treatment was enough for 
the little rock. It couldn’t be cleans- 
ed; it couldn’t be unpoisoned after 
that. It would be deadly for a thou- 
sand years. Then they gave it its 
first official name, Venenatus, the 
poison asteroid. A near approach 
would radiate the flesh off a man’s 
bones. 

Things came back to normal in 
about three years. The shrews had 
killed each other, and the wise rats 
once more ran the warren. The new 
fortunes tottered and fell back into 
the bags of the old. 

Somewhere, we never did know its 
exact location, San Simeon (no long- 
er able to pay the high price for 
protection) lost its independence and 
became again a run-down rancho. 

Gold stuck to some fingers long^ 
er than to others. Fuentes and Grind- 
er will never run out of it. Trevino 
was choked to death by the political 
strings on his. He died along with 
his small country, and he hadn’t in- 
tended to. 

Szild didn’t know what he did with 
all his money. He paid little atten- 
tion to it, and he suspected that he 
hadn’t received nearly as much of 
it as had his nervous partners. 

He spent it manfully. He threw 
it away. It gave him a dour pleas- 
ure to go from billionaire to bum. 
Then Arpad Szild was down to his 
last San Simeon Duro. 

He laughed. Something had been 
missing from his life. Now it might 



IF 




be back. His gold was gone. So what 
to do? 

He went up for some more. 

Up to Venenatus the poison aster- 
oid that would radiate a man’s flesh 
off? 

Sure. Szild didn’t believe a lot of 
that stuff. 

P atrick T. K. was alone in his shop 
when there entered a hooded 
man with a small heavy package. 

“I was beginning to think I would 
see you no more,” said Patrick. “I 
was told that that traffic had ended. 
I should have known better. I believe 
you are the same man, my first sup- 
plier of it, though I cannot see your 
face.” 

“I have none,” said the hooded 
man. “How much for this?” 

“Oh, ten dollars.” 

“A pound?” 

“No. The lot. I figure about eight 
cents a pound. That’s as high as I 
can go on contaminated gold. Oh 
sure, I can clean it. It’s only the 
smart men who say it can’t be done. 
It will even leave a handy profit for 
myself, though not for you. Gold’s 
about done for.” 

“That isn’t much. I have more of 
the stuff, a fair small load.” 

*T can take about this much a 
week. Can you live on ten dollars 
a week?” 

“Yes. I don’t eat any longer — no 
stomach. I don’t sleep. I just keep 
moving. I can live on that.” 

“And when your fair small load is 
gone?” 



“I go up for another.” 

“They say nobody goes there and 
returns.” 

“I do. But it isn’t crowded there 
now.” 

“I’ve a feeling that comes to me 
rarely. I’d like to help you. Are you 
blind?” 

“I believe so. I have pooled what 
is left of each of my senses, and 
somehow it serves. I need no help. 
I’m the only happy man in the world, 
the one who found the pot of gold. 
They can’t take that from me. I’ll 
go get it forever.” 

“After you’re dead?” 

“Oh, yes. I’ve known space 
ghosts. Now I’ll be one. It isn’t any 
one line you cross. I live in delirium, 
of course. It doesn’t blunt pain, but 
it does change the viewpoint. On my 
last trip down, after I knew that I 
was already dead, that both 1 and 
the gold were ghosts, it was easier. 
Oh, those are long nights in purga- 
tory I tell you, but I’m not irrevoc- 
ably damned. There’s still the gold, 
you see.” 

“You’re a happier man than I am. 
So pass it over.” 

“Here it is.” 

B ut when Szild passed the heavy 
small package to Patrick, he did 
it with a hand that was stark splin- 
tered bones with only a little black 
flesh around the heel of it. 

Patrick T. K. raised an eyebrow 
at this, but he didn’t raise it very 
high. A sly gold deal^ meets all 
types. END

A million parsecs from legendary Terra, at the Thieves' Market

is born. He grows up among the gracyl, a leathery, winged group of out- 
casts whose knowledge is entirely instinctive, and who are the servants 
and victims of the Veed, the saurian ruling class of Tombool. The Yill 
slave T'hoy hoy tells Roan the legends of ancient Terra, of her heroes and 
her empires, and of the fabled war with the terrible Niss, which destroyed 
the power of both forces, and left the empire in shambles, so that the

tightrope walking, and also because as a human he will make a good freak. 

Roan meets and falls in love with the beautiful exotic dancer, Stel- 
laraire, who helps him find a place in the hierarchy of the circus and 
introduces him to Iron Robert, the strongest being in the universe. The 
hatred between Ithc and Roan comes to a head when Ithc takes Stellar- 
aire off after a show, and Roan finds him torturing her with a nerve gun, 
to the amusement of a group of minor circus people. Roan kills Ithc and 
rescues Stellaraire, but is shaken by the utter lack of loyalty or decency he 
meets with everywhere. 



wasn’t much use with a mined hand, 
anyway.” 

*But what about his friends?” 
“You're talking like a Terry,” 
Stellaraire said, and sipped her wine 
appreciatively. Roan tasted it, too. 
It was a blossom-pink EVoree from 
Aphela and it tasted like laughter. 



A Igol II was a wonderful pale 
green gold-edged mountain that 
filled half the immense view-screen 
in the dusty room that had once 



been the grand observation salon. 

“I’ve got an idea,” Roan said, 
standing with his arms around 
Stellaraire’s slim waist. “I’ve been 
thinking about what you said, about 
there being a lot of mutant Terrans 
here, and about the climate being 
like Terra. Why don’t we stay here? 
When the show pulls up, we’ll dis- 
appear. Gom Bulj woiidn’t go to 
the expense of coming back after 
us.” 

“Why?” the girl asked, raising 



EARTHBLOOD 



105 





her violet-pencilled eyebrows. “What 
would we do on Algol II?” 

“We wouldn’t stay. Just until we 
made enough credit to leave. I have 
to get back ho — back to Tambool. 
Ma’s still back there, all alone 
now.” 

“But the ’zoo is my home! I’ve 
never been any other place since 
I was ten years old. It’s safe here, 
and we can be together.” 

“And besides,” Roan went on, 
“Ma will know all about where I 
came from; maybe who my blood 
father and mother are. I have fo 
find out. Then I’m going to Terra.” 
“Roan, Terra’s just a mythical 
place! You can’t — ” 

“Yes, I can,” he said. “Terra’s 
a real place. I know it is. I can 
feel inside that it’s real. And it’s 

not like other worlds. On Terra 

everything is the way things should 
be. Not all this hate, and not car- 
ing, and dirt and dying for noth- 
ing. I’ve never been there, but I 

know it as though I’d spent all 
my life there. It’s where I be- 

long.” 

Stellaraire took his hand, leaned 
against him. ”Ah, sweetie, for your 
sake I hope it*s really there — some- 
where. And if it is,” she added, “I 
know someday you’ll find it.” 

T he ’zoo w6nt well on Algol II. 

Roan was sure-footed and nim- 
ble on the high wire in the light 
gravity, only three-fourths ship- 
normal, and Stellaraire’s dance was 
an immense success with the mu- 
tant Terrans, who were odd-looking 
dwarves with bushy muttonchop 
whiskers and bowed legs and im- 



mense bellies and no visible dif- 
ference between the sexes; but they 
appreciated the erotic qualities of 
her performance so well that a num- 
ber of the locals occupying ringside 
boxes began solemnly coupling with 
their mates before she had even 
finished. 

Afterwards, Roan found Stellaraire 
by the arena barrier, watching Iron 
Robert in his preliminary warm-up 
bout. 

“I’ve planned a route for us,” he 
said softly. “As soon as — ” 

“Shhh . .” she said, and put 
a hand on his arm, her eyes on the 
spot-lit ring where the stone giant 
was strangling a great armored 
creature with insane, bulging eyes. 
It was already quite dead. He was 
mauling it for the amusement of 
the crowd which had no way of 
knowing the beast had died minutes 
before. 

“Listen,” Roan insisted. “I have 
clothes and food in a bundle. Are 
you ready to go?” 

She turned to look up at him. 
“You really mean it? Now? Just like 
that, just walk off?” 

“^\^at other way is there? This 
is as good a time as any.” 

“Roan, it’s crazy! But if you’re 
going. I’m going with you. But listen. 
Wait until after Iron Robert’s act. 
We can slip away while the tops 
are going down. Somebody might 
notice if we tried it now — and 
whatever we do, we don’t want to 
get caught. Gom Bulj has some 
pretty drastic ideas about what to 
do with deserters.” 

“All right. As soon as the fight’s 
over and the noise-makers come on,

we’ll mingle with the marks and go 
out gate nineteen. There’s a patch 
of big plants growing over on that 
side, and we can duck in there and 
work our way to the town.” 

There was scattered applause as 
Iron Robert tossed his victim aside 
and raised his huge, square hands 
in his victory sigiL He came over 
to where Roan and Stellaraire stood, 
accepted a towel tossed to turn by 
Mag or his twin brother. He wiped 
pale pink blood from his face and 
hands, then took a scraper from bis 
belt pouch and began to clean him- 
self, frowning as he worked. He was 
very neat and meticulous and it 
made a tooth-cracking noise. 

“How you like fight, Terry?” he 
asked suddenly, scraping his arm 
with long strokes. 

“I didn’t really see it,” Roan 
answered. “When I got here it was 
already over.” 

Iron Robert chuckled, a sound 
like a boulder rolling downhill, 
“Fans like see plenty action,” he 
said. “Iron Robert kill too quick, 
have to ham up act little, give eweiy^ 
body money’s worth.” He finished 
his toilet and put the scraper away. 

“Next fight different maybe,” he 
said. “Parlagon easy. Tear up whole 
parlagon with bare hands. Ghinazell 
next. Never see chinazeH before, 
ChinazeU pretty tough, some say. 
What is chinazeH? Who care? Tear 
him up, too.” 

“I guess you can beat just about 
anything they put in against you,” 
Roan commented, looking around to 
see if Gom Bulj was in sight. It 
wouldn’t do to have him watching 
when they made dieir try. 



“So far, Terry,” the giant said. 
He looked at Roan with an unread- 
able expression in his green-glass 
eyes. “Iron Robert meet all comers. 
Some day being too tough to kill.” 
He waved a hand at the stands. 
“That what all come, hope for. 
Soime day they see. Maybe today. 
Maybe next year. Maybe hundred 
years. Meantime, meet all comers, 
fight to win. Iron Robert bom to 
fight. Fight until die.” 

A hom blew long, nerve-shred- 
ding blasts. Crews were haul- 
ing sections of heavy fencing into 
the cleared arena. The PA system 
boomed out a description of the 
coming battle. Iron Robert took a 
gallon-sized swig from a bottle, 
tossed it aside, stalked out into the 
center of the ring under the glare 
of the lights. Jumbo appeared, 
hauling a vast, iron-barred cage. Its 
sides trembled as something inside 
slammed against the bars. The 
crowd fell suddenly silent. An im- 
mensely tall, thin being dressed in 
green silks that flapped about its 
long shins puUed a rope and the 
end of the cage fell aside. 

A triangular, scaled head poked 
out, swaying inquiringly on its ser- 
pentine neck. Then the <^nazell 
bounded from the cage and shook 
the ground when it landed. It was 
an incredibly monstrous creature, 
a primitive-world dinosaur type with 
bony plates along its high-arched 
spine. But the fearsome thing about 
it was the gleam of intelligence in 
the small, glistening eyes. It paused 
a moment, surveying the sea of 
faces behind the barriers, and gaug- 



108 



IF 




ing Iron Robert, half its size, who 
stood watching it and ganging it 
back. 

Roan heard Stellaraire’s quick in- 
take of breath. “No wonder the bet- 
ting was so high,” she said. “Gom 
Bulj said a syndicate was importing 
something special from Algol II, 
just for the fight. It’s a high-G 
planet, and that monster’s used to 
weighing twice as much as he does 
now. Look at him! I don’t think I 
want to watch this.” 

“You’re not really worried, are 
you?” Roan asked. “I mean, it’s 
fixed, isn’t it?” 

Stellaraire whirled on Roan. “I’ve 
known Iron Robert ever since I was 
a little girl,” she said. “I’ve seen 
him go up against the awfullest 
fighters and the cruellest killers on 
a hundred worlds, and he’s always 
won. He wins with his strength and 
his courage. Nothing else. Nobody 
helps him — any more than they 
helped me — or you!” She looked 
back toward the arena, where the 
chinazell had seen Iron Robert now. 
It gathered its legs under it, watch- 
ing him standing with his back to 
his opponent, his arms raised to the 
crowd in the ancient salute of the 
gjadiator. 

“Fm affaid. Roan,” Stellaraire 
said. “He’s never fought anything 
like this beforeP 

The chinazell moved suddenly; it 
rose up on its hind legs and charged 
like a huge, ungainly bird straight 
toward Iron Robert’s exposed back. 
Stellaraire’s fingers dug deep ipto 
Roan’s arm. 

“Why doesn’t he turn!” 

At the last possible moment. Iron 



Robert pivoted with a speed that 
seemed unbelievable in anything so 
massive, leaned aside from the chin- 
azell’s charge and struck out with 
a club-like arm. The blow resounded 
against the beast’s armored hide 
like a cannonball striking masonry; 
it staggered, broke stride, sent up 
a spray of dust as it caught ifself, 
wheeled and pounced. The vicious 
triangular head whipped ’down with 
open jaws that clashed against Iron 
Robert’s stony hide and dragged 
him from his feet. 

His arms encircled the scaled 
neck, hugging the monster close. In 
sudden alarm, it braced its feet and 
backed, and Iron Robert held on, 
twisting the broad head sideways, 
his fingers locked in the corners of 
the clamped mouth. The heavy rep- 
tilian tail slammed the ground in 
a roil of dust. Sparks flew where 
the bright talons of the creature’s 
short arms raked Iron Robert’s in- 
vulnerable chest and shoulders. Then 
it opened it jaws, whipped its neck, 
flung Iron Robert aside. He rolled 
in the dust, and before he could 
come to his feet, the chinazefl 
^rang to him, brought an immense 
hind foot down in an earth-shaking 
kick. 

Roan coughed as dust floated 
across from the scene of the bat- 
tle. 

“I can’t see!” Stellaraire wailed. 
“What’s happening?” 

Iron Robert was on his feet again, 
grappling a hind leg nearly as big 
as himself. The chinazell, its weight 
down on its stunted forelimbs, 
sidled awkwardly, trying to shake 
its attacker loose. Its head came 



EARTHBLOOD 



109 




around and down, striking at Iron 
Robert. He hunched his head closer 
to his shoulders and reached up for 
a higher grip. 

“The thing’s too big for him,” 
Stellaraire gasped. “He can’t reach 
a vulnearable spot I” 

W ith a surge, the chinazell rais- 
ed the trapped leg clear of 
the ground and dashed it down. Iron 
Robert slammed against the con- 
crete-hard clay — but he kept his 
grip. 

“He’s hurt!” Stellaraire choked. 
“It’s all he can do to hold on — 
and that isn’t doing him any good. 
But if he lets go, it will kick him 
again!” 

“At least its teeth aren’t hurt- 
ing him,” Roan said. “He’s all right. 
He’ll hold on until he tires of it, 
and then — ” 

“It won’t tire. Not in this light 
gravity.” 

The chinazell stood, its ribbed 
sides heaving, its head on its long 
neck twisted to look at Iron Robert, 
who shifted his grip suddenly, 
leaped, caught a bony boss that 
adorned the dino’s withers and 
hauled himself across the creature’s 
back, his weight bearing it down. 
Its legs sprawled out. It plunged 
violently, striking with its yard-wide 
jaws as dust rose up in a dense 
cloud. 

The chinazell came out of the 
dust cloud, wheeled and charged 
down on Iron Robert as he came 
to his feet. It bounded past him 
and struck with its immense tail, 
a blow like a falling tree. Iron Ro- 
bert went down. The dino galloped 



away, circled, and Roan saw that 
its tail was broken, the hide torn, 
blood washing down across the 
scales, caking the dust. The head 
writhed on the long neck as the 
voiceless creature shuddered its 
pain. It came to a halt, the broken 
tail dragging now. Its head whipped 
from side to side as though seeking 
some escape from its torment. Fifty 
yards away, Iron Robert came slow- 
ly to his hands and knees. 

“He’s hurt!” Stellaraire cried. 
“Oh, please. Iron Robert! Get up!” 

The chinazell moved heavily, 
painfully. It walked to Iron Robert, 
stood over him. It maneuvered into 
position, raised a leg like an iron- 
wood log set with spikes, brought 
it down square on Iron Robert in 
a blow that shook the ground. 

“Gom Bulj has got to stop it!” 
Stellaraire screamed. “It will kill 
him!” 

“Wait!” Roan caught her arm. 
“He’s not finished yet! Look!” 

The chinazeH was moving awk- 
wardly sideways, its head held low. 
Iron Robert’s mighty arms circled 
the lean neck. As it dragged him, 
he freed one arm, raised it, drove 
his stony fist into one small, lizard 
eye. The chinazell bucked and tried 
to shake free, but Iron Robert held 
on, twisted, struck at the other eye. 
The dino reared and plunged des- 
perately, and Iron Robert dropped 
away, lay on his back. He raised 
his bloody fists, let them fall back. 

The blinded chinazell stopped, 
squatted; thick blood ran down the 
triangular face; the primitive mouth 
opened in voiceless agony. It rose, 
ran a few yards, dragging its dead 



110 



IF 




tail, then squatted again, its small 
cunning gone with its eyes. A mur- 
muring ran through the silent crowd, 
and someone started a hissing, and 
at the sound the chinazell leaped 
up, crashed aimlessly against the 
thick fence. People scrambled back 
in fright, screaming, and the pan- 
icked beast lunged, brought down a 
section of the barrier, then turned 
and blundered back, struck the 
fence again. There was a blare of 
noise from the PA system, and 
Gom Bulj appeared, a vivid, bloated 
figure in scarlet capes, carrying a 
heavy power gun. He took aim, 
blew the head off the maimed 
beast. It fell over sideways like a 
mountain, kicked out once, twice, 
then lay still. The headless neck 
twitched as blood pumped out to 
puddle in the dust like black oil. 

Gom Bulj walked over to Iron 
Robert, stood looking at him, still 
holding the gun in his hand, rais- 
ing it now .... 

4tXTor Stellaraire was round the 
barrier, running toward the 
entrepreneur. 

‘‘You can’t!” Roan heard her 
voice, almost drowned now in the 
angry shouting of the crowd that 
had seen the two most deadly fight- 
ers in the Galaxy maim each other, 
and still felt cheated because there 
hadn’t been more blood and agony. 

As Roan came up, Gom Bulj was 
holding up a many-fingered hand* 

“As you wish, my dear,” he was 
rumbling. “I merely thought — ” 

“Iron Robert’s not just another 
wounded animal,” Stellaraire flar- 
ed. 



“But o>f course he is,” Gom Bulj 
boomed, lighting up a footlong cigar. 
“What else would you call him? But 
no matter. Say your farewells or 
whatever, and then back to work, 
eh?” He turned away. 

“We’ll have to get a crew over 
here,” Roan said. “He’s too heavy 
to lift.” 

“Leave him where he* is,” Gom 
Bulj said. “Disposal is the local’s 
problem. And now I really must — ” 

“Aren’t you even going to try 
to help?” Roan demanded, standing 
in front of the bulky businessman. 

Gom Bulj waved his cigar, blink- 
ing at Roan. “Ah, you Terries,” he 
chuckled. “So impractical . ” 
He rippled quickly to one side and 
past Roan and the crowd of hurry- 
ing circus hands swallowed him up. 
The audience was melting away. 
Almost before they were clear the 
seats were going down, and the 
crews had started on striking the 
top. Stellaraire was bending over 
Iron Robert. 

“Good by,” she said sadly. “You 
fought awfully well. Iron Robert. 
He was just too big for you,” 

The stone giant opened his eyes. 
“Chinazell . tou^ fighter,” he 
said in a gritty, labored voice. 
“Dirty . trick . gouge . 
eyes.” His craggy face was con- 
torted and his huge chest labored 
with the effort of his breathing. 

“Do you think you could stand?” 
Roan asked. He gripped a massive 
arm and pulled, but it was like 
pulling on the trunk of a fallen 
tree. “We’ve got to get help,” he 
said, looking over toward the ship 
that was visible now where the tent 



EARTHBLOOD 



111 




had been peeled back. A crew was 
folding up the arena partitions, and 
a group of busy locals were setting 
to work to skin out the cbinazell. 
There was no one else near. 

“No one will help,” Stellaraire 
said. “They just . don’t help. 
And anyway — ” !^e paused, look- 
ing at Iron Robert as he lay sprawl- 
ed out on his back. 

“Anyway ... no use,” the giant 
growled. “Iron Robert bad hurt. 
Bone in back broken. Legs , . 
not move. You go now, Gom Bulj 
not like you be late.” 

A bald, thick-necked humanoid 
came up, cradling Gom Bulj’s power 
gun in his arm. 

“Get moving, you two,” he or- 
dered. ‘Tliere’s work to be done. 
Gom Bulj said — ” 

“Don’t you give me orders, Bul- 
ugg,” Stdlaiaire snapped at him. 
“Anyway, we were just going.” 
“I’m not leaving him here like 
this,” Roan said. He looked help- 
lessly around. The skinners were 
lifting a sail-fike flap of homy skin 
from the chinazell, exposing the 
bone-white flesh of the dino’s flank. 
No one was paying any attention 
to Iron Robert’s plight. No one 
cared. Beyond the busy throng fold- 
ing canvas, the animals were mov- 
ing up the aft gangplank into the 
ship. There was a holdup as a 
humped animal decided to sit cross- 
ways and someone yelled for the 
electric goad. Then Roan saw Jum- 
bo heaving over the ’zoo grounds 
like a ship in a slow sea. 

“Get Jumbo,” he said to Stellar- 
aire. “m find some ropol* 

“But, Roan — ” 



“Do as I tell youl” he snapped. 
He started away and the guard said, 
“Hey!” and brought the gun around. 

“Shut up, Bulugg!” Stellaraire 
said. “And don’t get any ideas with 
that gun. You’re just supposed to 
hold it and scare people.” 

XIII 

R oan looped the thick, oily plastic 
cable under Irop Robert’s arms, 
tied it in a vast knot. Stellaraire 
was perched on Jumbo’s head with 
her legs hanging down over his 
gray, furrowed forehead. The pachy- 
derm moved his trunk restlessly as 
Roan tied the cable to his leather- 
and-chain harness. Looking toward 
the ship, Roan saw that the animals 
were almost all aboard now. The 
last of the yard wagons were puff- 
ing away toward the greenish blaze 
of the setting sun with their loads. 
A shrill whistle sounded from the 
ship. 

“Hey, shake it up!” Bulugg called. 
“That’s minus a quarter. Whatta, 
you wanna get left?” 

“Pull, Jumbo!” Stellaraire cried. 
“Hurry! Pull!” 

The elephant took a step and 
jolted to a stop. He looked back 
over his shoulder, puzzled, and 
flapped his ears. 

“Pull, Jumbo,” Stellaraire called; 
and Jumbo leaned into his harness 
and pulled, sensing the necessity of 
something more than ordinary ef- 
fort. Iron Robert budged, dragging 
a furrow in the ground and Jumbo 
strained, putting his back into it, 
placing his great feet and thrusting, 
hauling the dead weight of many 



112 



IF 




tons across the dusty day of the 
empty arena. 

A t the gangplank, Bulugg jumped 
at the sound of the shrill last- 
warning whistle. He waved the gun 
nervously. There were faces at the 
port above, looking down curiously. 

“Five minutes to the Seal Shjp 
bell,” he blustered. “You can leave 
that hunk of rock right here and 
get aboard!” 

Jumbo put a foot on the wide 
gangway, started up. A loud- 
speaker was chanting checklist or- 
ders. Gom Bulj appeared above, 
looking out from the cavernous' hold. 

“Here, here, what’s this?” he bel- 
lowed. He waved his arms, staring 
around as if outraged. Iron Robertas 
vast inert weight dragged in the 
dust like a broken monument, 
reached the end of the gangplank 
— and jammed. 

Jumbo heaved, the harness taut 
across his chest. A rivet popped 
from it and clattered against the 
hull. Roan ran to the fallen giant, 
caught up a long pole, levered at 
the stony shoulder. Jumbo rocked 
twice, then heaved again — and Iron 
Robert bumped up on the gangway, 
grinding along the incline with a 
noise like ' a wrecked ship being 
hauled off a launch pad. 

Then they were in the hold and 
Gom Bulj was rippling his walking 
tentacles, muttering loudly, and the 
others were staring and then walk- 
ing away, bored quickly with Terry 
foolishness. Stellaraire’s lavender 
powder was caked with sweat and 
two of her gold-painted, so-carefuUy 
tended fingernails were broken off. 



But Roan looked at her and found 
her beautiful, with dust in her ochre 
eyes and streaks down her face, 
and her gold tights plastered against 
her body. The port clanged shut. 

The ship’s lights came on, and 
they stood and looked down at the 
great body they had salvaged. 

“Well, there went your chance to 
run away from the ’zoo,” Stellaraire 
sighed. “What are you going to do 
now? Just leave him here?” 

“We’ll get the vet to look at him. 
He’ll know how to fix him. You 
and I will bring him food and 
scrape him. After a while he’ll be 
all right again.” 

The girl looked into Roan’s face 
curiously. “Why?” she asked. “He 
was nothing special to you. You 
hardly knew him.” 

“Nobody should be left alone to 
die because they’re hurt,” Roan said. 

“You crazy, funny Terry,” Stel- 
laraire said, and then she was cry- 
ing, and he held her, wondering 
if it was because she was a Mule 
and not a real Terran that she was 
so hard to understand at times. 

F or two months Iron Robert lay 
in the canvas-hung compart- 
ment Roan and Stellaraire had ar- 
ranged for him in the cargo hold, 
with his lower body encased in 
massive concrete casts to remind 
him not to try to move. Every day 
Roan or the girl went over him 
with a scraper, and assured him 
he was as handsome as ever. Now 
and then Gom Bulj came down to 
stare at the huge invalid, rap his 
nine knuckles against the casts and 
mutter about expense. 



EARTHDLCX>D 



113 




When the day came that the vet 
said the casts could come off, Nugg 
came down and helped Roan work 
carefully with a jack hammer, free- 
ing him. When they finished, Iron 
Robert sat up, then got to his feet 
and stood, whole again. 

“Terry customs strange,” he rum- 
bled, looking down at Roan. “Not 
call you Terry now. Call you Roan. 
Iron Robert your friend. Roan. Not 
understand Terry ways, but maybe 
good ways. Maybe better ways than 
Iron Ro^rt ever know before.” 
Gom Bulj appeared, puffing two 
cigars. He looked Iron Robert over, 
shaking his head. 

“A remarkable thing, young Ter- 
ry. It appears you were right. A 
valuable property, and good as new 
— I hope. I’m a fair being, young 
Terry, and I have decided to reward 
you. Henceforth, you may consider 
the Mule, Stellaraire, as your per- 
sonal concubine, for your exclusive 
use — except when I have important 
Terry-type gu^ts, of course,** 

“She’s not yours to give away,** 
Roan said sba^ly. 

“Eh? What’s that, not mine?” 
Gom Bulj blinked at Roan. “Why 
I paid — ” 

“No one owns Stellaraire.” 

“See here, my lad, you’d best 
remember who it is you’re address- 
ing! Are you forgetting I could 
have ypii trussed up in leathers and 
flogged for a week?” 

“No,” Iron Robert rumbled. ‘*No 
one lay hand on Roan, Gom Bulj, 
Iron Robert kill any being that try. 
Even you.” 

“Here!” Gom Bulj back-pedaled, 
staring around wildly. “What’s the 



cosmos coming to? Am I to be 
threatened by my own property?” 

“Iron Robert not property,” the 
giant rumbled. “Iron Robert of royal 
ferrous strain, and belong to no 
being. And Roan my friend. Tell 
all crew. Roan friend to Iron Rob- 
ert.” 

“And since you can’t give me 
away,” Stellaraire put in, “Roan 
still has a reward coming. I think 
it’s time you gave him full freak 
status and started paying him. And 
he should be freed from all duties 
except his high-wire act. And he 
should eat in the Owner’s Mess, with 
the other stars.” 

“Why, why — ” Gom Bulj stut- 
tered. But in the end he agreed and 
hurried away, still muttering to him- 
self. 

XIV 

r iere had been a party celebrat- 
ing Iron Robert’s successful de- 
fense of his title against a Fire- 
saber from Deeb. Roan had drunk 
too much and not left Stellaraire 
until almost ship-dawn. Now he 
struggled out of a dream in which 
he fought against iron arms that 
closed on him, hearing the beloved 
voice that called by the arena gate. 

His eyes were open now. He 
could hear his own breath rasping 
in his throat, and the voice was 
the wailing of a siren, but the 
crushing weight still held him, flat 
on his back with the edge of the 
bunk cutting into his arm, and a 
wrinkle in the blanket under him like 
a sword on edge. Far away, bells 
clanged, and a tiny glow grew be-

cabin door, swelling into a balefol 
red that flashed on, off, on . 

Roan moved, dragged an arm like 
an ironwood log across his body, 
turned under the massive pressure 
and fell with stunning violence to 
the floor from the bunk. 

Lying on his face, he felt the 
deep vibration through the deck- 
plates. The engines were nmning — 
here in deep space, four parsecs 
from the nearest system! 

He rose to his feet, his bones 
creaking under the massive accelera- 
tion — three gravities at least. Far 
away, over the bellow of the en- 
gines, the clang of bells, the whine 
of the siren, he thought he heard 
the sound of Jumbo’s trumpeting. 

He made his way across the room, 
into the corridor, dragging feet like 
anchors, while the noise swelled, 
crimson lights screamed red alarm, 
far-away voices called. At the end 
of the corridor the lift door waited, 
open. Inside, he reached to the con- 
trol panel, pressed the button for 
the menagOTcs deck. For a moment, 
magically, the wdght went away and 
he drew a iM-eath. Then massive 
blackness damped down while tiny 
red lights whirled. 

He was lying on the floor of 
the car, smelling the salty sea-smell 
of blood. Through the open door 
under the blue-white glare of the 
ceiling, he saw the long white cor- 
ridor, the barred doors. Oawling 
again, he made his way along the 
passage, feeling the slickness under- 
foot, seeing how the pattern spread 
from under the doors, blackish red 
and harsh green mingling in a ^Us- 



tening film that trembled in a geo- 
metric resonance pattern. 

All around him, over the mind- 
filling Niagara of the engines, there 
were bellows, groans, grunts ci fmal 
agony. Roan went on, not looking 
into the cages as he passed them 
one by one, seeing the film of 
blood dance, spreading. 

The high, barred door, of Jumbo’s 
stall was bulged outward, one two- 
inch steel rod sprung from its sock- 
et. Behind it, the elephant lay, 
blinded, ribs broken, one tusk 
snapped off short. Blood flowed 
from the open mouth, from under 
the closed eyelids. Roan could see 
the animal’s massive side rise in a 
tortured heave as it struggled to 
breathe. 

“Jumbo!” he choked. 

The heavy trunk groped toward 
him. Tlie great legs stirred; a moan 
rumbled from the crushed chest 

Roan looked at the power rifle 
clamped in a bracket beside the stall 
door. He pulled it free, checked 
the charge, raised it against the 
rdentless pull, aimed between the 
closed and Hoody eyes, and pceesed 
the firing stud. 

A larms jangled monotonouriy in 
the carpeted corridor outside 
the quarters of Gom Bulj. Roan 
dragged leaden feet pest the fallen 
body of an Ydican, lying with one 
three-fingered hand outstretched to- 
ward the door of the patron’s apart- 
ment. 

Inside, Gom Bulj lay sprawled, 
his body crushed against the floor, 
his eyes bulging from the pressure. 
He moved feebly as Roan came

to him and went heavily down to 
hands and knees. 

“Why are you . killing us all 
. G?om Bulj? Roan asked, then 
stopped to breathe. 

“No ...” the entreprenaur’s 
voice was a breathless wheeze. “Not 
me ... at .... all .. young Terry.” 
He drew a hoarse breath. “Old 
battle . reflex . circuits . 

triggered . somehow. Maximum 
acceleration . three . standard 
. gee.” 

“Why?” 

“Ah, why indeed . young Ter- 
ry ... ” 

“What . can we do?” 

“It’s ... too bad ... too bad, 
young Terry. No help for us. The 
time has come ... to terminate 
... the biological processes ...” 

“You mean . die?” 

‘*When the . environment be- 
comes . hostile ... a quick 
demise ... is greatly ... to be 
desired.” 

“I want to live. Tell ... me what 
to do.” 

Gom Bulj’s massive head seemed 
to sink even deeper into the com- 
pressed bulk of his body. “Self- 
preservation ... an interesting . 
concept. A pity ... we won’t have 
... the opportunity ... to discuss 
. it.” 

“What can * I do, Gom Bulj?” 
Roan reached to the bulbous body, 
gripped " a thick arm. “I have . 
to try ... ” 

“I suggest . you suspend . 
respiration. Five minutes . should 
do the trick ... As for me ... I 
may thresh a bit . but pay . 
no attention ...” 



“FII turn off the engines,” Roan 
choked. **How?” 

“No use . young Terry. Too 
far. Even now . blood runs . 
from your nostrils.” 

“Tell me what to do.” 

“On the war deck ...” Gom 
Bulj gasped. “Command . con- 
trol panel. A lever — painted white 
. But . you can’t.” 

“I’ll try,” Roan said. 

I t was an interminable time later, 
and Roan’s hands and knees 
left red marks against the gray 
decking as he pulled himself across 
the raised threshold of the door 
which a red glare-panel warned: 
BATTLE CONTROL — AUTHOR- 
IZED PERSONNEL ONLY. 

Across the dusty room, the dead 
gray of the great screens had 
changed to vivid green-white on 
panels alive now with dancing 
jcwel-lights. A dark shape moved 
on the master screen. Below, mass 
and proximity gauges trembled; 
numbers appeared and faded on the 
ground-glass dials. Roan pulled him- 
self to the padded Fire Controller’s 
seat, spelled out the symbols flash- 
ing in blue: IFF NEGATIVE. 

A yellow light blinked suddenly in 
the center of the panel. Red let- 
ters appyeared on the screen, spelling 
out words in archaic Universal: 
MAIN BATTERIES ARMED 
The words faded, changed: 

MAIN BATTERIES FIRE, TEN 
SECONDS ALERT. 

The auxiliary panels blinked from 
yellow to red to white. 

FIRE ALL, the panel spelled out. 
Through the seat. Roan felt a

IF 




tremor run through the ship, brief- 
ly rattling a loose bolt in the panel, 
^fore him, the banked controls 
sparkled row on row, telltale lights 
blinking insistently, gauges produc- 
ing readings, relays closing, clicking, 
as the robot panel monitored the 
action. Roan’s eyes blinked back 
haze, searching for the white-painted 
switch. 

It was there, just to the right 
of the baleful crimson dial lettered 
MAIN RADAR — TRACKING. 
He reached out, forcing his heavy 
hand up, grasped the smooth lever, 
threw it from AUTO to MANUAL. 

The war lights blinked off. He 
searched the instruments before 
him, found a notched handle let- 
tered EMERGENCY ACCELERA- 
TION, threw it to ZERO. 

A thousand noises growled down 
to silence. Roan seemed to float 
upward from the chair as the pres- 
sure dropped to the ship-normal half 
gee. In the stillness, metal popped 
and groaned, readjusting to the re- 
duced stresses. Distantly someone 
screamed, again and again. 

Roan thought suddenly of Stellar- 
aire, alone in her cabin. 

He ran, leaping down the com- 
panionways, along to her door. It 
stood ajar. He pushed it wide — 

With a sound like the clap of 
gigantic hands, the room exploded 
in his face. 

H e was a dust mote, floating in 
a brassy sky where thunder 
rolled, remote and ominous. Some- 
where, someone called to him, and 
he would have answered, but his 
yoke was choked with smoke as 



thick as S5mjp. He fought to clear 
it, and then his eyes were open 
and he saw broken metal, the frag- 
ments of a flower dish and of a 
yellow blossom, and a white hand, 
limp, the fingers curled. 

He was on his feet, choking in 
an acrid reek of burnt metal, throw- 
ing aside a shattered chair, heaving 
at a fallen fragment of paneling, 
coughing as dust boiled up from 
the rubble of insulation, charred 
cloth, smashed glass and wood and 
plastic. 

She lay on her back, her eyes 
closed, he face unmarked. Her plat- 
inum hair swirled across her fore- 
head. 

“Stellaraire!” He knelt, feeling 
scorching heat against his face, 
brushing away dust, splinters, paper. 

The duralloy beam lay across her 
pelvis, pinning her tight. Roan felt 
his throat close as he gripped the 
cold metal, strained at it, felt its 
massive inertia. On his knees, he 
wrapped his arms around the metal 
section, heaved back until the room 
swam red. 

The odor of smoke was stronger 
now. Roan stood, hearing the ring- 
ing in his head, seeing the pale 
yellow flames that licked at scat- 
tered paper and torn cloth. Twisted 
wires and broken conduits sagged 
from the broken wall. Water trickled 
from a ruptured pipe, and beside 
it a stream of sharp-odored liquid 
poured down. 

The little colored fish from the 
tank lay stiff on the floor. 

Too late. Roan whirled, threw 
a quilt over the burning paper. With 
a whoosh! the coolant fluid ignited. 



EARTHBIOOD

Now red fire boiled black smoke, 
and a w^ve of heat struck Roan’s 
face like a whip. He seized up a 
blanket, thrust it against the broken 
water line, then threw the wet cloth 
over Stellaraire’s body. It hissed 

when it touched the floor beside 

her. He threw himself down, not 
noticing the searing pain against his 
back, braced his feet, set his shoul- 
ders against the beam, and pushed. 
It was like pushing at a granite 
cliff. The air he breathed burned 
in his throat. 

There was a fallen length of 

duralloy channel under his hand. 

He thrust it under the beam, lever- 
ing until the shirt split across his 
back. The channel buckled. When 
he tossed it aside, there were yellow- 
ish-white burns on his palms. 

Stellaraire’s hair was burning, the 
platinum-gold strands blackening 
and curling. Roan stumbled to the 
door, out into a smoke-blinded cor- 
ridor. He would find Iron Robert, 
and together they would free Stel- 
laraire . 

XV 

I n the thick-rugged chamber of 
Gom Bulj, the entrepeneur lay 
where Roan had left him, in a 
puddle of blood, heavy lids half- 
closed over dull eyes. 

“You succeeded, young Terry,” 
he said, his voice a thin echo of 
its old rumble. "Too late for me, 
I fear.” 

Roan swayed on his feet. “Where 
is Iron Robert, Gom Bulj?” 

“Alas, I don’t know.” The dull 
eyes turned to Roan’s hand. 



“You are burned, poor lad. Now 
you will die, there’s a clever boy. 
Too bad. I had great ambition for 
you, young Terry. One day . 
I would have billed you ... as 
the galaxy’s greatest freak.” 

“It’s Stellaraire,” Roan said, talk- 
ing now through a black mist that 
closed over tighter, ever tighter. “I 
need Iron Robert.” 

A wall annunciator crackled and 
a strange voice spoke: “Attention 
all hands! Assemble in the main din- 
ing hall at once! Bring no weapons! 
Disobedience is death!” 

“What voice is that?” Gom Bulj 
said faintly. “Are we boarded 
then?“ 

Roan made his mind work. “I saw 
a ship,” he said, “on the screens. 
We fired — and they fired back. I 
think they won.” 

“Yes,” Gom Bulj blinked heavy 
lids. “I knew it. I felt the shocks. 
Alas, in her day Belshazzar was a 
mighty dreadnought of the Empire. 
But now she has fought her last 
action.” His voice faded to a whis- 
per. 

“What should I do, Gom Bulj?” 
Roan cried. 

The heavy body stirred; a last 
hoarse breath sighed out. 

Roan looked down at the still 
body. 

“Gom Bulj is dead,” he said 
aloud. “Jumbo is dead . and . 
and ...” 

He whirled, ran into the corridor 
and toward the dining hall. 

A ll around, sounds of destruction 
echoed along metal halls. A 
muffled blast shook the deck plates

IF 




under foot. Harsh odors of hot 
metal and things that burned caught 
at Roan’s throat. He came to the 
arched entry over the ‘two wide 
steps leading down to the broad 
room with its threadbare eternon 
carpets and blackened gilt fixtures, 
and stopped, seeing overturned ta- 
bles, huddled bodies, and standing 
among them, legs braced wide, cra- 
dling weapons, five creatures in coats 
covered with tight-curled hair. 

“Help me!” Roan called. 

The nearest creature whirled, 
swung his weapon around in an 
easy gesture. There were horns on 
his head, and his eyes were black 
stones. 

A big creature in a radiation mask 
stepped to the horned creature’s 
side, knocked the weapon aside, 
then turned the power pistol gripped 
in his big fists on Roan, looked 
him over through the slits in* the 
mask. 

“Don’t burn this one, Czack. 
Can’t you see he’s a Terry?” 

‘To the pit with Terries,” the 
other snarled — but he lowered his 
gun. 

“Stellaraire,” Roan said. Help 
me. 

The tall creature bolstered a pistol 
and took off 'the mask. Roan looked 
into wide gray eyes, saw the thin 
nose, the edge of white teeth be- 
tween the thin lips. 

Roan stared. 

“You look like pretty pure stock, 
kid,” the tall Man said. “Where 
you from?” 

“You’re a Terran,” Roan said. 
“Help me! The fire — ” 

The horned creature stepped 



close, swung a wide hand against 
Roan’s head. He staggered; the 
room rang. 

“Hands off the kid,” the Man 
said. Roan shook his head* blinking 
back a blurring film. 

“But I asked you a question, kid. 
Henry Dread doesn’t ask twice.” 
The pistol was still centered on 
Roan’s chest. 

Roan turned, started back up the 
steps. A horned humanoid blocked 
his way, swinging a slow blow that 
Roan leaned aside from. 

“Get out of my way,” Roan said. 
“I have to find Iron Robert!” 

“Hold it.” Henry Dread had both 
guns in his hand now, and he turned 
to the arched door way. A tall, 
green-skinned Ythcan stood at the 
top of the two steps. Beside Roan, 
Czack brought his power rifle up. 
There was a deafening ba-wam; and 
a flicker of blue light. The Ythcan 
spun back, fell, kicked and lay 
still. 

“See if there’s any more,” Henry 
Dread snapped. A hair-coated crea- 
ture with hunched shoulders and a 
bald skull moved past Roan, sprang 
up the steps. Beyond him. Roan saw 
a wide silhouette looming against 
the corridor’s glare. 

“Iron Robert!” Roan shouted. 
“Run!” 

Facing Iron Robert, the bald crea- 
ture fired at point-blank range. Roan 
saw the flicker of blue light that 
played for an instant against Iron 
Robert’s broad chest, heard a deep 
grunt; then Iron Robert took two 
steps, plucked the bald one from 
the floor, whirled him high and 
threw him against the wall. He re-

bounded, Jay utteiiy still, his face 
oddly flattened, Mood dribbling 
from his ear. 

“Stand clear,** Henry Dread bark- 
ed. “My blasters will take him.” 

Roan struck with the edge of 
his hand at the burned one’s arm, 
caught the power rifle as it fell, 
swiveled on Henry Dread. 

“Don’t shoot him!” Roan said. 

Iron Robert stood, his eyes mov- 
ing from one to another of the six 
weapons aimed at him. Beside Roan, 
the homed creature snarled. “What 
are you waiting for? Kill him!” 

H enry Dread looked at Roan. He 
turned slowly, bringing his guns 
around to aim at Roan’s chest. 
“Drop it, kid.” 

“No,” Roan said. 

The Man’s mouth twitched. There 
was sweat on his forehead. “Don’t 
try me, kid. I’m supposed to be 
fast — and you’re covered. Now let 
the gun down nice.” 

“Roan,” Iron Robert’s deep voice 
rumbled. “I kill this one?” He took 
a step forward toward Henry Dread. 
Six guns tracked him. 

“No, Iron Robert. Go to Stellar- 
aire — quickly!” 

“I kill him easy,** Iron Robert 
said. “Have only two small guns.” 
“Help Stellaraire, Iron Robert!” 
Roan sauted. *“Do as I tell you!” 
Standing straight. Roan forced 
himself not to think about Stellar- 
aire or about the bums on his hands 
and body, or about the smell of 
charred flesh, but only about hold- 
ing the gun aimed at the pirate’s 
chest. And Iron Robert imderstood 
and he turned and went 



“Be smart, kid,” Henry Dread 
said between gritted teeth. “Drop 
it, before I have to bum you.” He 
was tall and solid, with a scarred 
face and thick fingers. He stood, 
two guns aimed at Roan, tense and 
ready, and the sweat trickled down 
his face. 

‘Try it,” Roan said. 

Henry Dread’s mouth twisted in 
a sort of smile. “Yeah, you’re fast, 
kid. Nobody ever took a gun away 
from Czack like that before.' I don’t 
think he likes you for it.” 

“Why don’t you kill the muck- 
gmb!” The horned one stood in a 
half-crouch, eyes on Roan. 

“Go ahead, jump him, Czack. 
Even if I put two through the head. 
I’ll bet you a keg he’d nail you on 
the way down. Want to risk it?” 

The other answered in an incom- 
prehensible language. Henry Dread 
barked an order. His creatures 
stirred; two filed carefully past Roan 
and out into the corridor. 

“Don’t let them try to hurt Iron 
Robert,” Roan said. “If he doesn’t 
come back. I’ll shoot you.” 

The pirate licked his lips, his 
eyes on Roan’s. “Whafs that walk- 
ing Bolo to you, kid? You’re hu- 
man!” 

“He’s my friend.” 

“Friends with a Geek?” Henry 
Dread sneered. 

“Why are you killing everyone?” 
“This tub fired on me first — 
not that my screens can’t handle 
museum pieces like you tossed at 
us.” The Man’s eyes narrowed. “No- 
body lobs one into Henry Dread 
and gets away with it.” 

“You killed Jumbo — and Gom

Bulj — and maybe . his voice 
broke, 

“Don’t take it so hard, kid. With 
me it’s business. I needed fuel and 
ammo . .” The voice seemed to 
fade and swell. Roan held his eyes 
open, leaning against the wall just 
slightly, holding the gun steady. 

. this tub happened along. 
That’s life.” 

T here was a movement in the cor- 
ridor behind Henry Dread. 
Iron Robert stepped into view. Be- 
hind him, a hair-coated creature 
stepped from a door, brought up a 
gun — 

Roan swiveled and fired, and was 
back covering Henry Dread’s belt 
buckle in a movement quicker than 
the eye could follow. The gunner 
fell and lay still. 

“Wait there. Iron Robert,” Roan 
called. 

The big Man lowered his pistols, 
tossed them aside. He looked 
shaken. “Holding these diings is 
likely to be dangerous,” he said. 
“Kid, you move like a fire lizard on 
Sunside. But you’re burned pretty 
bad. You need to have my medic 
take a look at you. Now, just akn 
that blaster off-side, so no accidents 
happen, and we’ll talk this thing 
over.” 

Roan held the rifle steady, listen- 
ing to the surging in his head. In 
the doorway. Iron Robert stood and 
waited. 

“Look, kid, you put the gun 
down, and I’ll guarantee you safe 
conduct. You and the one-man task 
force, too. You can’t hold the iron 
on me forever.” 



Roan looked at the Man’s eyes. 
They were steady on his. 

“Well you give me your word as 
a Man?” Roan asked. 

The Man stared at him. “Sure, 
kid.“ He glanced at Czack and the 
others. 

“You all heard what he said, 
didn’t you?” he said flatly. 

Roan lowered the ‘rifle. Czack 
moved in, snatched it away, brought 
it up and around — 

Henry Dread took a step, 
slammed a gnarled fist against the 
horned head. Czack dropped the 
rifle and spun against the wall. 
Henry Dread massaged his fist. 
“The slob didn’t think I meant it.” 
He looked at Roan. “I guess us 
Men got to stick together, eh, kid?” 
He bent and scooped up a gun. Iron 
Robert came toward him, a blackish 
stain on his shoulder. 

“Shall I kill this one now?” he 
rumbled. 

“No. Iron Robert . Stellaraire 
. .” Roan leaned against the wall, 
feeling the dizziness rising. Iron 
Robert caught him. 

“No, Roan,” The great ugjy head 
shook slowly. “The Fair One is gone 
away, now. Now she dances for the 
Gods in their high place, above all 
sorrow.” The deep voice seemed to 
come from far away. 

‘Take Roan to your doctors, 
Man!” 

“Yeah — the kid’s in bad shape. 
You better come too, big boy. 
You’re a tough one. You took a 
blaster on half-charge at five paces, 
and you’re still walking and ready 
to eat ’em alive. Maybe I can use 
a Geek like you at that.”

r iey were alien hands, gentle but 
impersonally insistent. They 
poked and prodded with a feel of 
slick, scaly hide, and hard, too-thin 
fingers. There was no comfort in 
alien hands. They weren’t like Stel- 
laraire’s hands, warm and soft and 
— human. 

Roan moved to thrust the hands 
away, and searing pain flashed 
through his body. He gasped, not 
at the bodily agony but at the sud- 
den vivid remembrance of hands 
that would not touch him again, and 
white-gold hair, and smiling ochre 
eyes. 

“He wakes,** a reedy voice said. 
“A tenacious organism. Not like 
some of these beings, who seem al- 
most to wish to flee to the long 
darkness. I feel their souls tremble 
and shrink under my hands, and 
they are gone like a snuffed candle. 
But not this one.** 

“Make Roan live. Man-doctor,** 
Iron Robert’s basso rumbled. “Make 
Roan live strong.** 

“Yes, yes. Stay back, you great 
ugly lout. Now, the wounds are 
clean. And I have here . .** There 
was a sound of rummaging. 

“Aha! Now, we’ll see.** 

Roan stiffened at a sensation like 
molten lead poured across his chest 
He was aware of white lights glaring 
through his eyelids. He moaned. 

“Eh, he feels it now. Lie easily, 
Terran. It is only pain.** 

“You make pain go away, Man- 
doctor!** 

“I’ve yearned for a proper patient 
for these medicines, ugly giant! A 



fabulous pharmacopeia, all made for 
Terrans ages dead. Long have I 
saved them. Henry Dread likes to 
fancy his rogues have human blood, 
but my knives know all their se- 
crets. Half-castes, mutants, human- 
oid trash! Now, this lad’s different. 
He’s almost a textbook example of 
your pure Terry stock. A rare crea- 
ture.” 

The thin voice rambled on, and 
the hands probed and the fire touch- 
ed, flamed and faded into* a dull 
numbness. Roan let out a long 
breath and felt drugged drowsiness 
creeping over him like warm water 
rising in a tub. 

“This skin,” the voice went on, 
far away now. “The texture! How 
nicely the blade slides through it! 
And the color. See, look at this illu- 
stration in my book.** 

“Does he sleep. Man-doctor? Or 
— ?” 

‘^He only sleeps, monster. Faugh, 
Fm pleased I have no need to take 
a scalpel to that horny hide of 
yours. Now get back. I’ve two hours 
of close work ahead, and no need 
of your rusty bulk to hinder me.” 

I t was many hours later. Roan 
opened his eyes and by a faint 
light filtering through a barred tran- 
som saw the massive silhouette be- 
side him. 

“Iron Robert.” Roan’s voice was 
a weak croak. 

“You wake now, Roan. You 
sleep, good. Man-doctor small fool- 
ish creature, but he fix you good. 
Roan.” 

“I should have shot him. Iron 
Robert.** 



122 



IF 




“No, Roan. He fix you.” 

“I mean the Man. He killed Stel- 
laraire. I should have killed him. 
You should have smashed them, 
smashed their ship.” 

“Then Roan and Iron Robert 
die, too, Roan. Too soon to die 
for you. Too many strange things to 
see yet, too many places still to go. 
Long life ahead for you still. Roan.” 
“Not for me. Fm only a Terry 
freak, and Fm almost dead already. 
Dad told me. Humans only have 
time to start living and they die. 
And living’s no fun. Not any more.” 
“Sure, lots of fun still to come, 
Roan. Many great jugs to drink, and 
far suns to see; many females to 
take, and enemies to kill, and whole 
universes to see and smell and taste. 
Plenty time to be dead after.” 

“All my friends are dead. And 
Stellaraire. .” 

“I still alive. Roan.” Iron 
Robert moved and Roan heard a 
soft metallic clash. “Iron Robert 
your friend, sure.” 

Roan raised up on one elbow, 
ignoring a tearing sensation in his 
bandaged arm, peering in the dim 
light. Massive chains lay across 
Iron Robert’s knees, and his wrists 
were circled by shackles of finger- 
thick metal, 

“Iron Robert — you’re chained 
to the wall!” 

“Sure. Henry Dread scared of me, 
you bet. I let him put chains on me 
if he send Man-doctor to you.” 

Roan pushed himself upright, 
ignoring the pulse that start^ up, 
drumming in his temples. He swung 
his feet heavily to the floor. A 
blackness filled with whirling lights 



swelled to fill the room and he 
gripped the edge of the bunk, wait- 
ing for it to go away. 

“I’ll make him take them off,” 
he heard himself saying. “I’ll make 
him. It was a Man to Man pact.” 
“No, Roan, you lie down! Bad 
for you to move now.” 

“I don’t want to lie down. Call 
him. Call Henry Dread!” 

“Roan! You got to do like Man- 
doctor say, otherwise you get bad 
sick.” 

Roan was on his feet, feeling the 
floor sway and tilt under him. 

“Henry Dread,” he called, hearing 
the words emerge as a croak. 

“Wait, Roan. Somebody come.” 

T here were metallic sounds in the 
corridor. A splash of light 
glared suddenly; long shadows 
crouched away from the door that 
swung wide, and a tall, broad figure 
stood squinting into the room. 

“You yelling for me, were you, 
boy? Hey — on your feet already?” 
“You chained Iron Robert. You 
didn’t keep your word.” 

“Henry Dread always keeps his 
word, you!” The Man’s wide shape 
seemed to blur; Roan blinked hard, 
wavered, caught himself. 

“Unchain him. He’s my friend!” 
“You better crawl back in that 
bunk, boy. You’re raving! Fm cap- 
tain aboard this vessel; you’re a 
slave of war. I let the sawbones 
patch you up, but don’t let it go to 
your head.” 

Roan advanced toward Henry 
Dread on uncertain feet. 

“Unchain him, liar! Keep your 
word, murderer!” 



EARTRM.OOD

Henry Dread’s eyes narrowed. 
“Why, you lousy little — 

Roan lunged, and Henry Dread 
leaped back, jerked his pistol from 
his hip holster and aimed it. Iron 
Robert came to his feet in a clash 
of chain. 

“I’m aiming this right between 
yotir eyes, Terry boy,’’ Henry said 
between his teeth. “One more step, 
and so help me I burn you down.” 

"I don’t care about that,” Roan 
said, taking a step. “That isn’t any- 
thing.” 

**No, Roan!” Iron Robert boom- 
ed. “You do like Henry Dread say 
now, Roan!” 

Roan tried to take another step, 
but Uie floor tilted and he gritt^ 
his teeth, and willed himself not to 
fall, willed the blackness to re- 
treat. 

“I wear chains for you. Roan. 
You do this for me.” 

“Kid, you’re crazy!” Henry 
Dread’s voice barked. “You’ll kifl 
yourself!” 

“You wait, Roan,” Iron Rob^ 
said. “Later, when you get wdl, 
then you have chance to kill this 
one.” 

Henry Dread laughs it harsh 
snarl. **Yeah, l^ten to your side- 
kkk, kid. You kill me when you 
fed better.” 

Hien the shadows moved «id the 
fight narrowed down and was gone 
in a dang of metal, and Roan sank 
down, groped, found the bed, fell 
across it 

Tfe’s a Man, Iron Robert. A 
Terry — almost like me. But h6*s 
not like Dad said the Terries were.” 

“Henry Dread mi^ty scared 



Man, Roan,” Iron Robert rumbled 
softly. “And maybe he not such 
mean man like he make out. He 
come plenty quick, first time you 
call. Maybe Henry Dread wait out- 
side, hope you call his name. May- 
be Henry Dread plenty lonely Man, 
Roan.” 

T he bars welded across the door 
frame of the warhead storage 
room were as thick as Roan’s wrist 
and close together. He leaned on 
the mop and looked through the 
bars at Iron Robert, who sat on a 
duralloy slab that sagged under his 
weight, almost invisible in the sha- 
dows of the lightless cell. 

“The Minid they call Snaggle- 
head is the worst,” Roan said. “He’s 
about seven feet tall and he smells 
like a Charon’s mud-hive. Yester- 
day he tripped me and I almost 
fell down the aft companionway.” 
Iron Robert’s chains clanked. 
Roan could see his small eyes gleam. 
“You be careful. Roan. You don’t 
let riff-raff get you mad. You do 
like I say. Wait* 

“I don’t want to wait. Why 
should I wait?” 

“You wait cause you got plenty 
bad bums, not healed up yet. You 
want to get crippled for life? You 
wait don’t pay mind to anybody 
teases you.” 

“I do mind, though. I know which 
ones I’m going to kill first, just as 
soon as — ” 

“Roan, you stop that fool talk! 
You remember how you promise to 
do like I say.” 

“Ill keep my promise. Just be- 
cause Henry Dread’s word is no 



good doesn’t mean I’m a promise- 
breaker, too.” 

“You wait a minute. Roan. You 
too much angry against Henry 
Dread. He keep promise, all right. 
He say you and me, he won’t kill 
us. Well — ^both of us alive, all 
right.” 

“I’m going to tell him if he 
doesn’t free you. I’ll steal a gun the 
first chance I get and kill him.” 

“You do that, you big fool. Roan. 
I don’t mind sit here in dark, rest. 
Not much rest for me, long time. 
I sit and think about old days, back 
home, time Iron Robert young be- 
ing, have plenty fun. I got pretty 
good eidetic recall, remember all 
smells, tastes, sounds, faces. Sure, 
I got plenty good memories. Roan. 
First time I got time really look 
at them good.” 

“You’re stronger than any of 
them.” Roan took a breath and 
made his voice angry to cover ixp 
the break. “You let them chain you, 
you big dumb hunk of scrap-iron!” 

Iron Robert rumbled a laugh. 
“Plenty easy sit here with chains on. 
Tough for you. Roan, have to stay 
outside and let Snagglehead push 
you round. But you show you got 
brains. Roan. You stay quiet, you 
wait. One day you heal up good, 
then maybe us see.” 

Roan looked along the corridor. 
A watch changed as three Minid 
crewmen emerged from a cargo 
hold. 

“Well, you’ll get a chance to see 
how they operate now, Iron Rob- 
ert.” Roan felt his throat turn dry. 
“You’ll see how much good ignoring 
diem does.” 



126 



IF 




‘^kay, Roan, you go now, quick. 
Don’t have to wait for herd of mud- 
pigs” 

“I’ll take it without hitting back,’* 
Roan said between his teeth. “But 
I won’t run from them, I don’t care 
what you say.” He began working 
the mop, eyes on the floor. 

The leading crewman hooked his 
thumbs in his sagging pistol belt 
and started toward Roan, laying a 
trail of oily sandal-prints across the 
shiny expanse of freshly scrubbed 
floor. He had thick bowed legs and 
a hairless skull and there was a 
wide gap in the row of spade-shaped 
bluish teeth he was showing in what 
might have been a grin. Three loops 
of rough-cut yellow jewels hung 
against a grimy gold-braided tunic. 
He stopped two yards from Roan, 
plucked a dope-stick from a breast 
pocket, bit off the cap and spat it 
on the floor, sniffed it appreciatively 
with wide nostrils and said: 

‘^Hey, boys, looky what’s here.** 
He pointed with the dopestick, his 
wide mouth forming a loose-lipped 
O of mock amazement. “What is it, 
a itty-bitty baby boy playin’ like a 
growed-up Geek?“ 

“Now, it’s a cute little pansy- 
pants, talking to its sweety through 
the bars,” a second crewman offer- 
ed. “It thinks that rusted-out freak 
is mighty sexy.” 

“Hey, don’t talk dirty in front 
of it,” another said. “It might learn 
a dirty word and use it in front of 
its mama and get ‘panked.” 

“Always thought old Henry 
wasn’t as tough as some thought,” 
Snaggle-head stated. “Now he’s got 
hisself a i^ay-dolly.” He chuckled, a 



sound like gas escaping from a 
sewer. “Next thing, Old Cap’n get 
hisself a little Terry bitch and start 
in breedin* ’em.” He haw-hawed, 
hawked, spat on the floor at Roan’s 
feet. Roan stopped mopping, stood 
looking at the wide mural on the 
lounge wall, with its audiovision of 
a rolling seascape. In the silence the 
crash and hiss of breakers was loud. 
Snaggle-head chuckled again, took a 
final puff and dropped the dope- 
stick on the floor. 

“. but I notice he still don’t 
trust him far! not since he held that 
gun on his belt buckle. I think his 
little pet plunA scared him that 
time.” 

C asually, Roan slapped the wet 
mop across Snaggle-head’s san- 
dal. The big crewman jumped back 
with a yell, stamping his wet foot 
against the deck. TTic grin had van- 
ished from the loose mouth; the 
other crewmen watched with bright, 
interested eyes. Snaggle-head drew 
his massive head down close to his 
burly shoulders. His mouth was 
open, his brow creased in a black 
frown. 

Ignoring him, Roan thrust the wet 
end of the mop into the filter unit, 
watched the rollers close and open, 
went on with his mopping. 

Snaggle-head stepped in front of 
him; his grimy finger prodded 
Roan’s chest. Roan looked into the 
over-sized face, spotted here and 
there with coarse hairs sprouting 
from inflamed warty blemishes. 

“What you think you’re lookin’ 
at, punk?” 

“It looks like the hind end of a 



EARTHM.OOD 



127 




crundle-beast, ' Roan said dearly. 
“Only hairier.” 

The coarse face tightened; the 
finger jabbed again, hard. “You take 
a lot of chances, softy!” 

“Whatever it is, ‘TU remember it,” 
Roan continued. “Some day I’ll put 
my foot in it.” 

Snaggle-head^s eyes narrowed. 
“It’s a mean-talking one,” he said 
softly. ‘Too bad it ain’t got the guts 
to back up the talk.” The heavy 
hand swung in a short arc, slammed 
Roan’s head against the metal bulk- 
head. He staggered, caught himself 
with the unbandaged arm, shook his 
head to clear it. 

“Is that . the best you can 
do?” he asked blurrily. “I guess 
you’re scared to get too rough. 
There’s only three of you.” 

The crewman shook clawed 
hands, palms up, under Roan’s 
nose. 

“One of these days, pansy. I’ll put 
the thumbs in, wheje it counts. I’ll 
put ’em in till the blood squirts.” 

Roan looked into the pale eyes. 
“You will, eh? You think Henry 
Dread will let you?” 

The wide mouth dropped open. 
The pasty face turned a dull pink. 
“Whatta I care about Henry Dread? 
As soon as I get ready to croak 
you, rube, you’ll know it — and to 
the Nine Hells with Henry Dread!” 

“Careful,” Roan said, nodding 
toward the others. “They’re listen- 
ing.” 

“Huh?” The heavy head swiveled 
quickly to look at the two crewmen. 
They looked at the ceiling. 

“All right, you slobs. Let’s get 
moving. We ain’t got all day to gab 



with sissy-britches here.” The two 
filed past in silence. 

“I’ll get to you later, cull,” the 
lead crewman grated. 

“Roan,” Iron Robert’s voice 
rumbled from the cell. “You got 
to learn keep mouth shut some- 
times. That space-rat hurt you 
much?” 

“He didn’t hurt me.” Roan’s face 
was white in the giloom. 

“You not be so dumb, you not 
talk back, you don’t get hit.” 

“It’s worth it.” 

“Maybe some day he get really 
mad, hit too hard.” 

“He hasn’t got much of a punch.” 
“Maybe he got better punch than 
you think. Maybe what you said not 
so far off true.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Maybe Henry Dread better 
friend than you think. Roan. I think 
he tell all Gooks and Geeks, hands 
off Human boy. I think he have 
plans in mind for you. Roan.” 

XVII 

T he surgeon clicked his lipless 
mandibles, peeling off the pro- 
tective film under which the bums 
on Roan’s shoulder and arm had*" 
been healing for many weeks. 

“Eh, pretty, very pretty! Pink 
and new as a fresh^hatched suck- 
ling! There’ll be no scars to mar 
that smooth hide!” 

“Ouch!” Roan said. “That hurts.” 
“Ignore it, youngling,” the sur- 
geon said absently, working Roan’s 
elbow joint. He nodded to himself, 
tried the wrist, then the fingers. 
“All limber enough; now raise 



128 



IF 




your limb here.” He indicated shoul- 
d^ level. Roan lifted his arm, wmo- 
ing. The surgeon’s homy fingers 
went to the shoulder joint, prodding 
and kneading. 

‘‘No loss of tone there,** the 
surgeon muttered. “Bend over, 
stretch your back.” 

Roan bent, twisted, working the 
shoulder, stretching the newly heal- 
ed burns. Sweat popped out on his 
forehead. 

“At first it may feel as though 
the skin is tearing open,” the sur- 
geon said. “But it’s nothing.” 

Roan straightened. “I’ll try to re- 
member that.” 

The surgeon was nodding, closing 
his instrument case. “You’ll soon 
regain full use of the limb. Mean- 
while, the hide is tender, and there’ll 
be a certain stiffness in the joints.” 

“Can I — ah — do heavy work 
now?” 

“In moderation. But take care. 
I’ve no wish to see my prize ex- 
hibit damaged.” The surgeon rubbed 
his hard hands together with a chir- 
rupping sound. “Wait until Henry 
Dread sees this,” he cackled. “Calls 
me a Geek, does he? Threatens to 
put me out the airlock, eh? But 
where would he ever find anoth^ 
surgeon of my skill?” He darted a 
final, sharp glance of approval at 
Roan and was gone. 

Roan pulled his tunk over his 
head, buckled his belt in place and 
stretched his arms gingerly. There 
was a wide header over the door- 
way. He went to it, grasped it and 
pulled himself up carefully. The sen- 
sation reminded him of a Charon 
he had seen stripping hide from a 



dead gracyl . but the injured 
arm held his weight. 

He dropped back and went out 
into die corridor. There was a 
broken packing case in a reclama- 
tion bin in the corner. Roan wrench- 
ed a three-foot length of tough, 
blackish inch-thick wood from it. 
He looked toward the bright-lit in- 
tersection of the main concourse. A 
steward in soiled whites waddled 
past on bowed legs, holding a tray 
up on a stumpy arm. Henry Dread 
and his officers could be drinking in 
the wardroom now. It was as good 
a time as any. 

Roan turned and followed the 
dull red indicator lights toward the 
lower decks. 

H e was in a narrow corridor ill- 
lit by grimed-over glare panels. 
Voices yammered nearby: shouts, 
snarls, a drunken song, a bellow of 
anger. The third watch break hour 
was underway in the crew quarters. 

Roan hefted the skrilwood club. 
It was satisfactorily heavy. 

Feet clumped in the cross-corri- 
dor ten feet away. Roan ducked in- 
to a side passage, flattened himself, 
walchetT two round-backed barrel- 
chested humanoids high-step past on 
unshod three-toed feet, bells tied to 
their leg lacings jingling at each step. 
When they had passed, he emerg^, 
following the tiny green numbers 
that glowed over doors, found one 
larger than the others. 

Roan listened at the door; there 
was a dull mumble of voices. He 
riid the panel aside, stepped in. 

It was a barracks, and he 
wrinkled his nose at the fiiick fudgy 



EAltTHBiOOD 



129 




odor of unwashed bedding, alien 
bodies, spilled wine, decay. A nar- 
row, littered passage led between 
high bunks. A dull-eyed Chronid 
looked up at him from an unkempt 
bed. Roan went past, step^d over 
scattered boots, empty bottles, a pair 
of six-toed feet in tattered socks 
sprawling from a rump-sprung can- 
vas chair. Halfway along the room, 
four large Minids crouched on fac- 
ing benches, bald heads together. 

They looked up. One of them was 
Snaggle-head. 

He gaped; then his wide lips 
stretched in a cold grin. He thrust 
aside a leather wine mug, wiped 
his mouth with the back of a thick, 
square hand, got to his feet. He 
reached behind his back, brought 
out a knife with an eighteen-inch 
blade, whetted it across his bare 
forearm. 

“Well, looky whafs got loose 
from its string,** he started. 

•Don’t talk,” Roan said. “Fight” 
He stepped in and feinted with the 
club and Snaggle-head stepped heav- 
ily back, snorting laughter. 

“Hey, looks like Baby-face got 
hold of some strong ^garmush.” He 
looked around at the watchers. 
••What’ll we do with him, fellers?” 

But Roan’s club was whistling 
and Snaggle-head jerked back with 
a yell as the wood smacked solidly 
against his ribs. He brandished the 
knife, leaped across a fallen bench; 
Roan whirled aside, slammed the 
club hard against the Minid’s head, 
the crewman stumbled, roaring, 
rounded on Roan, a line of thick 
blackish blood inching down his 
leathery neck. He lunged again and 



Roan stepped back and brought the 
club down square across the top of 
die bald skull. Snaggle-head wheel- 
ed, kicked the bench aside, took up 
a stance with his feet wide, back 
bent, arms spread, the blade held 
across his body. He dashed blood 
away from his eyes. 

“Poundin’ my head with that ma- 
carobi-stick won’t buy you nothin, 
Terry,” he grated. His mouth was 
set in a blue-toothed grin. /‘I’m 
coming to get you now!” 

He charged, and Roan watched 
the blade swing toward him in a 
sweeping slash. At the last moment 
he leaned aside, pivoted and struck 
down at the Minid’s collar-bone. 
The skirl wood club hit with a sound 
like an oak branch breaking. Snag- 
gle-head yowled and grabbed for his 
shoulder, spinning away from Roan; 
his face twisted as he brought the 
knife up, transferred it with a toss 
to his left hand. 

•‘Now I kill you, Terry!” 

“You’d better,” Roan said, 
breathing hard. “Because if you 
don’t. I’m going to kill you.” Roan 
moved in, aware of a layer of blue 
smoke in the muggy air, wide eyes 
in big Minid faces, the flat shine of 
Chronid faces, the distant putter of 
a ventilator fan, a puddle of spilled 
beer under the fallen bench, a smear 
of dark blood across Snaggle-head’s 
cheek. The Minid stood his ground, 
the knife held before him, its point 
toward Roan. Roan circled, struck 
with the club at the knife. The 
Minid was slow: the blade clattered 
from the skinned hand, and Roan 
brought the heavy bludgeon up. 

His foot skidded in spilled beer. 



130 



IF 




He was down, and Snagglehead was 
over him, his wide face twisting in 
a grimace of triumph. The big hands 
seemed to descend almost casuaBy. 

Roan threw himself aside, but 
there were feet and a fallen bendi* 
and the hands clamped on him, 
biting like grapple-hooks, and gath- 
ering him into a strangling embrace. 

He kicked, futile blows against a 
leg like a tree-trunk, hearing the 
Minid’s breath rasp, smelling the 
chemical reek of Minid blood and 
Minid hide, and then the arms, thick 
as Roan’s thigh, tightened, and 
Roan’s breath went out in a gasp 
and the smoke and the faces blur- 
red ... 

4 4T et him breathe a little,” Snag- 
gle-head was saying. “Then 
we’ll see how good his eyeballs arc 
hooked on. Then maybe we’ll do a 
little knife work.” 

Roan twisted, and the arms con- 
stricted. 

‘TIa, still alive and kiddng.” 
Roan felt a big hand grope, rind a 
purchase on his shoulder. He was 
being held clear of the floor, clam{>- 
ed agamst the Minid’s chest. The 
Minid’s free hand rammed under 
Roan’s chin, forced his face back. 
A blunt finger bruised his eye, 
“Let’s start with this one.” 

Roan wrenched his head aside, 
groped with open jaws, found the 
edge of a hand like a hog-hide gjove 
between his teeth, and bit down wilh 
all the force of his jaws. 

The Minid roared. Roan braced 
his neck and clung, tasting acrid 
blood, feeling a bone snap b^Ofe 
the hand was tom from his grip. 



EARTHDLOOD 



And he struck again, buried his 
teeth in Snaggle-head’s shoulder, 
grinding a mass of leather-tough 
muscle, feeling the skin tear as the 
Minid fell backwards. 

They were on the floor, Snaggle- 
head bellowing and striking ineffec- 
tually at Roan’s back, throwing him- 
self against the scrambling legs of 
spectators, kicking wildly at nothing. 
Roan rolled free, came to his knees 
spitting Minid blood. 

“What in the name of the four- 
teen devils is going on here?” a 
voice bellowed. Henry Dread pushed 
his way through the crewmen, stood 
glaring down at Roan. His eyes went 
to the grovelling crewman. 

“What happened to him?” he de- 
manded. 

Roan drew breath into his tortur- 
ed chest. “I’m killing him,” he 
said. 

“Killing him, eh?” Henry Dread 
stared at Roan’s white face, the 
damp red-black hair, the bloody 
mouth. He nodded, then smiled 
broadly. 

“I guess maybe you’re real Terry 
stock at that, boy. YouVe got the 
instinct, all right.” He stooped, 
[Hcked up Snag^e^head’s knife, of- 
fered it to Roan. “Here. Finish him 
off.” 

Roan looked at the Minid. The 
cuts on the bald scalp had bled 
freely, and more blood from the 
tom shoulder had spread across the 
che^. Snaggle-head sat, legs drawn 
up, cradling his bitten hand, moan- 
ing. Tears cut pale paths through 
the blood on his coarse face. 

“No,” Roan said. 

“What do you mean, no?” 



“I don’t want to kill him now. 
I’m finished with him.” 

Henry Dread held the knife 
toward Roan. “I said kill him,” he 
grated. 

“Get the vet,” Roan said. “s4v 
him up.” 

Henry stared at Roan. Then he 
laughed. “No guts to finish what 
you started, hey?” He tossed the 
knife to a hulking Chronid, nodded 
toward Snaggle-head. 

“Get the vet!” Roan looked at 
the Chronid. ‘Touch him and I’ll 
kill you,” he said, trying not to 
show how much it hurt to breathe. 

In the profound silence. Snaggle- 
head sobl^. 

“Maybe you’re right,” Henry 
Dread said. “Alive, he’ll be a walk- 
ing reminder to the rest of the boys. 
Okay, Hulan, get the doc down 
here.” He looked around at the 
other crewmen. 

“I’m promoting the kid to full 
crew status. Any objections?” 

Roan listened, swallowing against 
a sickness rising up inside him. He 
walked past Henry Dread, went 
along the dim way between the high 
bunks, pushed out into the corridor. 

“Hey, kid,” Henry Dread said be- 
hind him. “You’re shaking like a 
Groaci in moulting time. Where 
the hell are your bandages?” 

‘I’ve got to get back to my mop,” 
Roan said. He drew a painfiri 
breath. 

‘To hell with the mop. Listen, 
kid — ” 

“That’s how I earn my food, isn’t 
it, I don’t want any charity from 
you.” 

“You’d better come along with 



132 



IF 




me, kid,” H^nry Dread said. “It’s 
time you and me had a litde talk.” 

XVIII 

I n his paneled, book-lined cabin, 
Henry Dread motioned Roan to 
a deep chair, poured out two glass- 
es of red-brown liquid. 

“I wondered how long you’d take 
the pushing around before you 
show^ you were a Man. But you’ll 
still have to watch yourself. Some 
of the boys might take it into their 
heads to gang up on you when they 
think I’m not looking.” 

‘77/ be looking,” Roan said. 
“Why do they want to kill me,” 
“You’ve got a lot to learn, lad.^ 
Most of the boys are humanoids; 
I’ve even got a couple that call 
themselves Terries. I guess they’ve 
got some Terry blood, but it’s pretty 
badly mutated stock. They don’t like 
having us damn near pure breds 
around. It makes ’em look like what 
they are: Gooks.” He took a swal- 
low from his glass. 

, “I don’t like to work around 
Gooks, but what the hell. It’s bet- 
ter’n living with Geeks.” 

“What’s the difference between 
a Gook and a Geek?” 

“I stretch a point. If a being’s 
humanoid, like a Minid or a Chro- 
nid, okay, give him the benefit of 
the doubt. Maybe he’s descended 
from mutated human stock. You got 
to make allowances for Gooks. But 
a life-form that’s strickly non-hu- 
man — that’s a Geek.” 

“Why do you hate Geeks?” 

“I don’t really hate ’em — bot 
it’s them or us.” 



Roan tried his drink, coughed, 
put the glass down. “What’s that? 
It tastes terrible.” 

“Whiskey. You’ll learn to like it, 
boy. It helps you forget what you 
want to forget.” 

Roan took another swallow of the 
whiskey, made a face. 

“It doesn’t work,” he said. “I still 
remember.” 

“Give it time,” Henry Dread 
growled. He stood aSnd paced the 
room. 

“How much do you know about 
Terry history, boy?” 

“Not much, I guess. Dad lised 
to tell me that once Terries ruled 
the whole galaxy, but then some- 
thing happened. Now they’re scat- 
tered, what there is left of them.” 
“Not ‘them,’ boy. ‘Us.’ Fm a 
Terry. You’re a Terry. And there 
are lots more of us. Sure, we’re 
scattered, and in lots of places die 
stock has mutated — or been bred 
out of the true line. But we’re still 
Terries. Still Human. And it’s still 
our Galaxy. The Gooks and Geeks 
have had a long holiday, but Man’s 
on the comeback trail now. And 
every Man has to play his part.” 
“You mean murdering people like 
— Stellaraire and Gom Bulj?” 
“Look, that’s over and done. To 
me a Geek’s a Geek. I’m sorry 
about the girl. But what the hell. 
You said she was only a mule.” 

R oam got to his feet; Henry 
Dread held up a hand. “Okay. 
No offense. I thought we had a deal? 
Let’s lay off this squabbling. We’re 
Terries. That’s what counts.” 

**Why should I hate Geeks?” 



EARTHBtOOD 



133 




Roan finished his drink, shuddered, 
put the glass on the table. “IVe got 
reason to hate you, but I was raised 
with Geeks. They weren’t any worse 
than your Gooks. Some of them 
were my friends. The only Human 
I ever knew was my father and I 
guess maybe he wasn’t all Human. 
He was shorter than you and wide 
through the shoulders and his arms 
were almost as thick as a Minid’s. 
And he had dark brown skin. I 
guess that couldn’t be real Terry 
human stock.” 

“Hard to say. Seems like I read 
somewhere that back in prehistoric 
times Men came in all kinds of 
colors: black, red, yellow, purple — 
maybe green, I don’t know. Rut later 
on they interbred and the pure color 
strains disappeared. But maybe your 
old man was a throwback — or 
even descended from real old stock.” 

“Does anybody know what a real 
Terry looks like?” Roan took a lock 
of his thick dark-red hair between 
his fingers rolling his eyes up to 
look at ft. “Did you ever see hair 
that col<H* before?” 

“Nope. But don’t let it worry 
you. Everybody’s got a few little 
flaws. Hell, Men have been wander- 
ing around the Galaxy for over 
thirty thousand years now. They’ve 
had to adapt to conditions on all 
kinds of worlds; they’ve picked up 
everything from mutagenic viruses 
to cosmic radiation to uranium 
burns; no wonder we’ve varied a 
lot from the pure strain. Pure or 
not us Humans must stick together.” 

Roan was looking at the empty 
glass. Henry filled it and Roan took 
another drink. 



“He wasn’t really my father,” he 
said. “He and Ma bought me in the 
Thieves Market on Tambool. Piid 
two thousand credits for me, too.” 
“Tambool. Hmmm. Hell of a 
place for a Terry lad to wind up. 
That where you were raised?” 

Roan nodded. 

“Who were your real parents? 
Why did they sell you?” 

“I don’t know. I was only a fer- 
tilized ovum at the time.” 

“Where’d those Geeks get hold 
of Terry stock?” 

“T don’t know. Dad and Ma 
would never talk much about it. 
And Uncle T’hoy hoy either. I think 
Ma told him not to.” 

“Well, it doesn’t matter. You’re 
the closest thing to pure Old Tetry 
stock I’ve seen. I’ve made you a 
member of my crew.” 

“I don’t want to be a member 
of your crew. I want to go back 
home. I don’t know if Ma’s still 
alive, even, with Dad not there to 
look after her. I miss Dad. I miss 
Stellaraire; I even miss Gom Bulj.” 
“Don’t cry into your beer, kid. 
What the hell, I’ve taken a liking 
to you. You play your cards right 
and you’ll do okay. You’ll live well, 
eat well, see the galaxy, get your 
share of loot, and some day — when 
I’m ready — you may be in on the 
first step toward something big. Big- 
ger than you ever dreamed of.” 

“I don’t want loot. I just want 
my own people. I don’t want to 
destroy. I want to build something.” 
“Sure, you’ve got a dream, kid. 
Every Man has. But if you don’t 
fight for that dream somebody else’s 
dream will win.”

“It‘s a big galaxy. Why isn’t there 
room for everybody’s dream?” 

“Boy, you’ve got a lot to learn 
about your own kind. We’ve got 
the drive to rule. To conquer or die. 
Some day we’ll make this galaxy 
into our own image of Paradise. 
Nobody else’s. That’s the way Men 
are.” 

“There’s billions of Geeks,” Roan 
said. “But you’re the only Man I’ve 
ever seen.” 

“There are Terries all over the 
Galaxy — wherever the Empire 
had an outpost. 1 mean to find 
them — one at a time if I have to. 
You think I’m just in this for the 
swag? Not on your life, boy. I could 
have settled down in luxury twenty 
years ago, but I‘ve got a job to do.” 
“Why do you want me? I’m not 
going to kill Geeks for you.” 
‘listen, kid, goon squads are 
cheap. I can hire all I want for 
the price of a good dinner at Mar- 
parli’s on Buna II. But you’re hu- 
man — and I need every Man I 
can get.” 

“I still haven’t forgotten,” Roan 
said. ‘That whiskey’s a fake. So are 
you. You killed my friends and now 
you think I’m going to help you kill 
some more.” 

H enry gripped Roan’s shoulder 
with a hard band. “Listen, boyl 
A Man’s got to live. I started off in 
the Terry ghetto on Borglu, kicked 
around, spit on, worked like a tun- 
lizard in the wood mines. There 
wasn’t a day they let me forget I 
was a Man — and that all I’d ever 
get was a Man’s share — the scraps, 
and the kicks, and the curses. I 



hung around back doors and ate 
garbage, sure. A Man’s got a drive 
to live — no matter how. And I 
listened, and learned a few things. 
They used to call me in and laugh 
at me. They’d tell me how once the 
Terries had been the cock of the 
walk in every town on ten million 
worlds, master of everything. - And 
how 1 was a slave now, and just 
about good enough, maybe, to wash 
their dirty clothes and run their 
errands and maybe some day, if I 
was a good worker, they’d get me 
a half-breed wench and let me father 
a litter of mules to slave for them 
after I was gone. 

“Well, I listened, and I got the 
message. But not the one they had 
in mind. They didn’t know Terries, 
boy. Every time they’d show me a 
book with a picture of a Terran 
Battle Officer in full dress, and tell 
me how the Niss had wiped out the 
fleet — or hand me an old Terran 
pistol and tell me how their great 
grand-pap had taken it off a starv- 
ing Man — it didn’t make me feel 
like a slave. It made me feel like 
a conqueror. One day one of them 
made a mistake. He let me handle a 
Mark XXX hand blaster. I’d read a 
book or two by then. I’d studied up 
on Terran weapons. I knew some- 
thing about a Marx three-X. I got 
the safety off and burned old Croog 
and two by-standers down and then 
melted off the leg-band.” Henry 
Dread stooped, pulled his boot off, 
peeled back his sock. Roan stared 
at the deep, livid scar that ringed 
the ankle. 

T made it to the port. There was 
an abandoned Terry scout boat

there, dozed off-side, buried in the 
weeds. I’d play around it as a kid. 
I had a hunch maybe I could open 
it. There was a system of safety 
locks — 

“To make it short, I got clear. 
I’ve stayed free ever since. I’ve had 
to use whatever gutter-scrapings I 
could find to build my crew, but 
I’ve managed. I’ve got a base now 
— never mind where — and there’s 
more battle-wagons ready for com- 
missioning — as soon as I get re- 
liable captains. After that — 

“Well, I’ve got plans, boy. Big 
plans. And they don’t include Geeks 
running the Galaxy.” 

“Iron Robert’s a Geek — and 
he’s my friend. He’s a better friend 
than any of those Gooks of yours.” 
“That’s right boy. Stick up for 
your friends. But when the chips are 
down — will he stick by you?” 

“He already has.” 

Henry Dread nodded. “I have to 
give him credit. I admire loyalty 
in a being — even a Geek. Maybe 
old Iron Pants is okay. But don’t 
confuse the isst». A go^, solid hate 
is a powerful weapon. Don’t go put- 
ting any chinks in it.” 

“Iron Robert is a good being,” 
Roan said. **He’s better than your 
Gooks and Geeks. He’s better than 
me. And better than you, too.” Roan 
stopped talking and swallowed. “I 
feel kind of sick,” he said. 

Henry laughed. “Go sleep it off, 
kid. You’ll be okay. Take the state- 
room down the hall from mine here. 
A Terry crew member doesn’t have 
to sleep with Gooks any more.” 
“I’ve got some rags outside Iron 
Robert’s cell. I’ll sleep there.” 



“No, you won’t, kid. I can’t have 
a Terry losing face with Gooks ^ — 
for the sake of a Geek.” 

Roan went to the door, walking 
unsteadily. “You’ve got a gun,” he 
said. “You can kill me if you want 
Id. ilnt I’m going to stay with Iron 
Robert until you let him out.” 

“That animated iron mine stays 
where he is!” 

“Then I sleep in the corridor.” 
“Make your choice, boy!” Henry 
Dread’s voice was hard. “Learn to 
take orders, and you live a soft life. 
Act stubborn, and it’ll be rags and 
scraps for you.” 

“I don’t mind the rags. Iron Rob- 
ert and I talk.” 

“I’m asking you, kid. Move in 
next door. Forget those worthless 
Geeks.” 

“Your whiskey’s no good. I 
haven’t forgotten anything.” 

“What’s the mntfer with you, you 
young squirt? Haven’t I tried to 
treat you right? I could send you 
below decks in lead underwear right 
now to swab out a hot chamber!” 
“Why don’t you?” 

“Get out!” Henry Dread grated. 
“You had a big credit with me, kid, 
because you looked like a Man. Un- 
til you learn to act like one, keep 
out of my way!” 

Outside in the corridor, Roan 
leaned against the wall, waiting for 
the dizziness to go away. Once he 
thought he heard a sound, as though 
someone had started to turn the 
door latch. But the door remained 
closed behind him. 

After a while he made his way 
down to Iron Robert’s cell and went 
to sleep.

I ron Robert shook the bars. “You 
big fool, Roan, go on raid with 
riff-raff, maybe get killed. What for? 
You stay safe on ship!” 

“I’m tired of being aboard ship. 
Iron Robert. This is the first time 
Henry Dread has said I could go 
along. I’ll be all right.” 

“What kind gun Henry Dread 
give you, Roan?” 

“I won’t need a gun. I won’t be 
in the fighting.” 

“Henry Dread still ’fraid give you 
gun, eh? He big fool too, let you 
go in combat with no gun. You 
small, weak being, Roan, not like 
Iron Robert. You stay on ship like 
always!” 

“There’s a city on this world — 
Aldo Cerise — that was built by 
Terrans, over ten thousand years 
ago.. Nobody lives there now but 
savages, so there won’t be much of 
a fight. And I want to see the city.” 
“Extravaganzoo play on Aldo 
Cerise, once, long time go. Plenty 
natives, plenty tough. Have spears, 
bows, few guns too. And not fools.” 
Roan leaned against the bars. “I 
can’t just stay on the ship, I have 
to get out and see things, and listen 
and learn, and maybe some day — ** 
“Maybe some day you learn stay 
out of trouble!” 

A wall annunciator hummed and 
spoke: “Attention all hands. This is 
Captain Dread. All right, you swabs, 
now’s your chance to earn some 
prize money! We’re entering our 
parking orbit in five minutes. Crews 
stand by to load assault craft in 



mne minutes from now. Blast off 
in forty-two minutes.” Roan and 
Iron Robert listened as Henry Dread 
read the order of battle, feeling the 
deck move underfoot as the vessel 
adjusted its velocity to take up its 
orbit four hundred miles above the 
planet. 

“I’ve got to go now,” Roan said. 
“I’m in boat number one, the com- 
mand boat.” 

“Anyway Henry Dread keep you 
by him,” Iron Robert rumbled. 
“Good. You stay close, keep head 
down when shooting start Henry 
Dread not let you get h\irt, maybe.” 

“He wants me on his boat so hie 
can keep an eye on me. He thinks 
I’ll try to run away, but I won’t. Not 
until you can go, too.” 

Boots clanged at the far end of 
the corridor. Henry Dread, tall in 
close-fitting leather fighting garb, 
swaggered up. He wore an ornate 
pistol at each lean hip and carried 
a power rifle in his hands. 

“I figured Fd find you tere, didn’t 
you hear my orders?” 

*T beard,” Roan said. ”I was just 
saying good-by.” 

**Yeah. Very touching. Now if 
you can tear yourself away, we’ve 
got an action to fight You stay 
close to me. Watch what I do and 
follow suit. I don’t expect much sta- 
tic from the natives, but you never 
know.” 

“Roan should have gun, too,” 
Iron Robert rumbled. 

“Never mind that. Iron Man. I’m 
running this operation.” 

“You nervous as caged dire-beast, 
Man. If everything so easy, what 
you afraid of?”

Henry narrowed his eyes at the 
|jant. 

“All right, I’m edgy. Who 
wouldn’t be? I’m hitting what used 
to be the capital of one of the 
greatest kingdoms in the Empire — 
and me with a seven-thousand year 
old hulk and a crew of half-breed 
space-scrapings. Who wouldn’t be a 
little nervous?” 

“Give Roan gun. Or does lad 
make you nervous too ” 

“Never mind. Iron Robert,” Roan 
said. “I’m not asking him for any- 
thing.” 

Henry Dread’s jaw muscles work- 
ed. He jerked the power riile. 
“Come on, boy. Get down to the 
boat deck before I change my mind 
and give you a job swabbing the 
tube linings!” 

“You bring Roan back safe, 
Henry Dread,” Iron Robert called. 
“Or better not come back at all.” 

“If I don’t, you’ll have a long 
wait,” the pirate growled. 

I n the cramped command com- 
partment of the assault boat, 
Henry Dread barked into the panel 
mike: “Now hear this, you space 
scum! We’re dropping in fast, slick 
and silent! I’m giving you a forty- 
second count-down after contact, 
then out you go. I want all four 
Bolos to hit the ramp at the same 
time, and I want to see those treads 
smoke getting into position! Gun- 
nery crews, sight in on targets and 
hold your fire for my command! 
Heli crews — ” 

The pirate captain gave his orders 
as the boat dropi>ed toward the gray 
world swelling on the forward re- 



peater screen. Ihe deck plates 
rumbled as the retro-rockets fired 
long bursts, correcting velocity. At- 
mosphere shrieked around the boat 
now. 

Roan saw the curve of the world 
swing up to become a horizon. A 
drab jungle continent swept under 
them, then an expanse of sparkling 
sea and a white surfed shoreline. 
There was a moment of vertigo as 
the vessel canted, coming in low 
over green hills; it rjghted sluggish- 
ly, and now the towers of a fantas- 
tic city came into view, brilliantly 
sparkling beyond the distant forest- 
clad hills. 

“Remind me to shoot that gyro 
maintenance chief,” Henry growled. 
Roan watched as tree-tops whipped 
past beneath the hurtling ship. Then 
it was past the wooded slopes, and 
the city was close, looming up, up, 
until the highest spires were hazy 
in the airy distances overhead. 

The ship braked, slowed, settled 
in heavily. A ponderous jar ran 
through the vessel. The torrent of 
sound washed away to utter silence. 
From below, a turbine started up, 
ran sputteringly, smoothed out. 
Henry looked at the panel chrono- 
meter. 

“If one of those slobs jumps the 
gun — ” 

A light blinked to life on the 
panel. 

“Ramp doors open,” Henry mur- 
mured. “Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, 
forty!” He whirled on Roan. 

“Here we go kid! With a little 
luck we’ll be drinking old Terry 
wine out of Terry crystal before the 
star goes behind those hills.”

IF 




R oan stood with Henry Dread at 
the foot of the ramp, looking 
out across a pitted and crumbling 
expanse of ancient pavement. Far 
across the field, four massive track- 
ed vehicles aimed black gun muz- 
zles at the silent administrative 
sheds. Nothing moved. 

“Empty emplacements,” Henry 
said. “Missile racks corroded out. 
It’s a walk-over.” 

“Iron Robert said the ’zoo played 
here once,” Roan said. “He said the 
natives have guns and bows, and 
know how to use them.” 

“The carny was here, eh? Who’d 
it play to, the rock lizards?” 

“People,” Roan said. “And they 
wouldn’t have to be very smart to 
be smart enough to stay out of sight 
when they see a shipload of scaven- 
gers coming.” 

“Corsairs!” Henry barked. “We 
don’t scavenge, boy! We fight for 
what we take. Nothing’s free in this 
Universe!” He thumbed his com- 
mand mike angrily. 

“Czack! Wheel that tin can of 
yours over here!” He turned to 
Roan. “We’ll go take a look at the 
city.” He waved his rifle toward 
the towers beyond the port. “This 
was one of the last Terry capitals, 
five thousand years ago. Men built 
the place, boy — our kind of Man, 
back when we owned half the 
Galaxy. Come along, and I’ll show 
you what kind of people we came 
from.” 

r iere was a high golden gate be- 
fore the city and at the top, 
worked in filigree, was the Terran 
Imperial symbol, a bird with a 



branch in its mouth, and a TER: 
IMP. above it. 

“I’ve seen it a million times, in 
my books back on Tambool,” Roan 
said. “That bird and the TER. IMP. 
above it. Why a bird, anyhow?” 
“Peace,” Henry Dread said. 
“Czack!” he bark^ into his com- 
mand mike. “Bring that pile of tin 
up here and put it in High.” Then 
he turned back to Roan. “TER. 
IMP. means Terra ran the show. 
And any bird that didn’t keep the 
peace got his guts ripped out. That’s 
how Men operate, see?” 

Peace, Roan thought, turning it in 
his mind, trying to smooth off the 
sandp apery edge Henry Dread gave 
to the word, watching the massive 
combat unit rumbling up beside him. 

‘Take it slow. Put it in Maxi- 
mum now,” Henry Dread said to 
Czack. “That fence is made of Ter- 
ralloy and nothing’ll tear it down 
but a Terry Bolo.” 

“But it’s stood for five thousand 
years and nobody can put up an- 
other one.” Roan said, wanting the 
TER. IMP. and the bird to stay 
there another five thousand years. 
“Why tear it down? Couldn’t you 
just blast the lock?” 

“Maybe. But this impresses the 
Geeks more, if they’re watching. 
Okay. Take it, Czack.” 

The gate screamed like a tom fe- 
male, bent slowly and finally landed 
over the Bolo with a horrible clang 
and the Bolo, a crease along its top 
turret now, went on through. Czack 
traversed his guns, looking for na- 
tives. 

The quick silence from the fallen 
gate and the dead city was eerie. 



EARTHBLOOD 



139 




Czack appeared at the upper hatch 
and swore at the gate and the Bolo 
and Aldo Cerise in general. He spot- 
ted the dent in the Bolo turret and 
swore worse. 

“Maybe we’fl find more Bolos 
in the City,” Henry Dread said. 
“Never seen an Imperial city with- 
out ’em and this was a great one. 
Get you a nice, new Bolo and some 
nice, new guns. Now get back in the 
tin can and keep us covered while 
we do some ground reconnaissance. 
Shoot anybody you see.” 

Henry Dread tucked the mike un- 
der his tunic. His heavy boots rang 
on the mosaic of the path they took 
beside the road, and he gestured 
with his gun as they went along. 

“Those buildings,” he said. “Ever 
see an3^hing that high for beings 
that don’t have wings?” 

The Terran buildings climbed high 
into the sunlight, incredibly straight 
and solid. From here it all looked 
perfect. But at Roan’s feet the tiles 
of the intricate mosaic were broken 
and missing in spots, and Henry 
Dread kicked at the loose ones as 
he walked along. 

Roan paused to watch a fountain 
throwing rainbows into the air, spin- 
ning shifting patterns of water and 
light. 

“They built things in those days,” 
Henry Dread said. “That fountain’s 
been running five thousand years. 
More, probably. Anything mechani- 
cal breaks in this city, fixes itself.” 
Roan was looking at the house 
beyond the foimtain, with the TER. 
IMP. symbol on the door, and he 
gaped up at row on row of floors, 
windowed and balconied. 



“It looks as though that door 
might open,” Roan said. “People 
might walk out. My people.” He 
paused, wondering how he would 
feel if this were Home. “But it’s all 
so perfect. So wonderful. If they 
could build like this, how could any- 
one beat them?” 

44^T^he Lost War,” Henry Dread 
A said, coming up to the foun- 
tain and drinking from a side jet. 
He wiped his mouth on his sleeve. 
“They call it the Lost War but we 
didn’t lose it. Terra never lost a 
war. A stalemate, maybe — we 
didn’t win it, either. Anybody can 
see that. But we broke the power 
of the Niss. The Niss don’t rule 
the Universe. There’s supposed to 
be the Niss blockade of Terra, and 
they say there’s still a few Niss crui- 
sers operating at the far side of the 
Galaxy. But that’s probably just 
superstition. Fve never run into a 
Niss. And never met anybody that 
did — Man, Gook or Geek.” 

Henry Dread got out his micro- 
phone. The men had come in 
through the ruined gate and were 
scrambling over the Bolo, perching 
on its armored flanks and hanging 
off the sides. 

“Fan out in skirmish order,” he 
barked. “Shoot anything that 
moves.” 

Roan followed Henry Dread. 
“Empty,” Roan said. “I don’t see 
anything that looks like natives 
might be living here. I wonder why 
not? With all this . .” 

“Superstition. They’re afraid of 
it.” Henry Dread’s eyes were darting 
in all directions. “But that doesn’t

mean there might not be a few na- 
tives inside the fence. And they may 
be right to be afraid of the City. 
Lxx)k over there.” 

There was a deep hole, blackened 
at the edges. 

“Booby-trapped,” Henry Dread 
said. “Don’t know how many might 
be around the city, or where. So 
watch out.” 

They came to a high wall, set 
with cJay tiles, and between the tiles 
grew tiny, exquisite flowers. 

“Park,” said Henry Dread. “Full 
blown memento of Terran luxury. 
Maybe have time for it later.” 

“Tank here!” one of the men 
called from behind a nearby build- 
ing. “Bolo Mark XXXV, factory 
fresh!” 

“Don’t touch her, you slat-headed 
ape!” Czack’s voice crackled from 
his Bolo. “I don’t want nobody’s 
filthy hands on her until I see her.” 

Henry Dread laughed. “It’s not 
a woman, you rackskull. And it’s 
my freaking tank and 77/ see it 
first.” 

“Look, I’m going in that park,” 
Roan said, “Call if you want me.” 

Henry Dread stopped, looked 
back at Roan, frowning. 

“I won’t desert,” Roan said. “Not 
as long as you’ve got Iron Robert 
back there in the hold.” 

“Maybe,” Henry Dread said. 
“Maybe if you go in that park you’ll 
find out the difference between 
Geeks and Men. Maybe you’ll un- 
derstand what I’ve been trying to 
tell you!” 

“Boss!” Czack called. ‘Take a 
gander at this. Full fuel tanks and 
magazines and — ” 



“Don’t touch an)rtihing!” Henry 
Dread called. “These damned Gooks 
have scrambled eggs for brains,” 
he added. 

“Okay,” Roan said, starting to 
climb up a gnarled old tree that 
looked over the garden wall. “Fire 
three shots when you want me to 
come out.” 

“Watch out, boy,” Henry Dread 
said, and stopped again. He took 
out his Mark XXX blaster and 
handed it over to Roan. 

“You’U come back,” he said. 
“And you’ll know more than you do 
now.” 

R oan balanced the gun in his 
hand, sitting on a lower limb 
of the old tree. He felt the solid 
metal of it, the waiting, repressed 
power, the cold steel with the flam- 
ing soul. He looked up briefly at 
Henry Dread, who laughed, know- 
ing what Roan felt with the gun. 

Then Henry Dread was striding 
away across the piaza and Roan 
clambered up the tree, thinking as 
he cfimbed of the gracyls and how 
he’d climbed to follow thdr flights, 
and of the circus and the tree he’d 
climbed to see it, the Never-never 
tree, little thinking it was his last 
day on Tambool. And at the height 
of the wall he thought of Stellaraire 
and the tightrope and his eyes 
stung, but then he looked over the 
wall toward the park. 

And there was no room for 
thought of the past. Here lay the 
Terran civilization that Henry Dread 
talked of rebuilding. 

Within the park green grass 
spread and flowers bloomed and 



EARTHBLOOD

Roan could see small automatic 
weeders moving along the paths 
where fountains rose and splashed 
untouched by time. 

And across the manicured pre- 
cision of the lawn, a fallen statue 
lay — a vast statue with a tunic 
draped around its hips. It lay face 
up, one arm raised, pointing now 
to the high skies. 

It was a Terran. Pure Terra. 

And made just like Roan. 

Roan leapt down from the wall 
onto a bank of springy grass, and 
ran to the statue. Feature for fea- 
ture — eyes, ears, nose, the connec- 
tions of muscles — this was Roan. 
Terran. 

Did my father look like this? 
Roan wondered. Who was this Man? 
Where did he come from? He walk- 
ed around to the base of the statue. 
TER. IMP., it said, with the dove 
and the branch. And then: 

ECCE HOMO 
July 28, 12780. 

“Eccc,** Roan said to the statue, 
touching it, wondering how the 
name was really pronounced. 

Then he became aware of sound 
scenting the air. The sound and 
scent seemed the same, both swirl- 
ing faintly through the sdll air and 
he followed the melody. The scent 
was not the heavy perfume Stellaraire 
used, nor were the soimds the coarse 
sounds of the circus noise-makers. 
It was all something else. Some- 
thing that stirred memories — hints, 
odors of memories — far in the 
deeps of Roan’s mind. 

Sunlight he’d never drowsed in. 



winds he’d never felt, peace he’d 
never known. 

Peace, he thought, knowing 
Henry Dread had said it wrong. 

The razored, spring-green turf 
came down to the edges of the peb- 
bled path and ran between gardens 
of jewel -bright flowers. A wide-pet- 
aled blue blossom, with black mark- 
ings like a scream in its throat, 
opened and closed rhythmically. 

The music stopped briefly and 
then changed, as though drawing out 
things in Roan’s mind. In the small 
pause, Roan heard the play of a 
fountain, a silver sound. 

Then, more silver still, came the 
faint call of horns rising and loud- 
ening and loosening old locks in 
Roan’s mind. A smoke-like drift 
of stringed music floated into 
the horn motif, countering it softly, 
and then running away and coming 
back a little different, so that the 
horn challenged it and took up the 
string song itself and then a further, 
tinkling sound joined the horn and 
string and built an infinite, convo- 
lute structure in Roan’s mind that 
spread through his whole being and 
finally broke into a thousand crys- 
tals, leaving Roan almost in tears 
for the old, old things that are lost 
and the beautiful, infinitely beauti- 
ful things that never existed. 

A fat bee droned past, bumbled 
inefficiently into a flower and 
hunted nearsightedly for a drop of 
honey. The flower folded a maternal 
petal over the bee and he emerged 
covered with yellow pollen and bum- 
bled away looking triumphant and 
ridiculous.

IF 




Roan laughed, his nostalgia 
broken. 

The music laughed, too. A little 
flute giggling and teasing and run- 
ning away. 

Roan went after the sound. 

The park went on and on and the 
flower scents changed and interwove 
like their colors. Roan came to a 
still, blue lake, floated with flowers 
and enormous, long-necked birds 
that swam like boats and drifted up 
to him inquiringly when he came 
to the edge of the lake. 

Roan turned from the lake into a 
wood where the vines made bowers 
— thomed vines heavy with sweet 
berries — slim, curled vines blue with 
wide-faced flowers. He walked 
through sunny slopes where tall 
grasses rolled like water in the wind, 
and deep groves where the moss 
grew close and green in the still 
shade of warm-barked trees. Then 
the grove narrowed to a dark, arch- 
ing tunnel of branches that ended 
suddenly in sunlight. 

Ahead of Roan was a wide, white 
flagstone walk that curved between 
fountains of flying water and led 
finally to a colonnaded terrace. From 
the terrace rose a fretted cliff of 
airy masonry. A house the wind 
blew thropgh. 

Roan, thirsty now, scooped up a 
handful of smooth, cool water. It 
had a taste of bubbles, a smell of 
sunshine. 

But the water had not been put 
there for any purpose, even to 
drink. It showered into the air mere- 
ly to fall back into the pool. It 
pleased Roan somehow to think the 
mighty Terrans made the water go 



up just so they could watch it com- 
ing down. 

He went up the wide, shallow 
steps, into the airy building that up 
close seemed as solid and lasting as 
time itself. The marble floor within 
was an intricate design of reds and 
blues that moved into purple and led 
the eye straight to a ramp slanting 
up to a gallery on the left. 

Roan listened for a moment to 
the ringing stillness, then started up 
the sloping way. 

XX 

T he house was a maze of rooms 
within rooms, all neatly kept. 
The air filters whispered noiselessly, 
but Roan could feel the air they 
drew. Doors opened silently to his 
presence, bmps glowed on to greet 
him, off to bid him good-by. On pol- 
ished tables were set objects of cur- 
ious design, of wood and metal and 
glass. Roan picked each up and 
tried to imagine its use. One, of 
green jade, grew warm as he held it. 
But it did nothing else and there 
were no buttons to press. So he 
carefully replaced k and went on. 
Then Roan noticed the pictures. 
He stood in the middle of a thin- 
ly furnished room and his eye was 
caught by a picture in sinuosities of 
blue, as interwoven and complex as 
the music he’d heard. Every time 
he looked at the picture the lines 
caught his eye a different way, led 
them along a different trail, and he 
looked at the picture so long the 
blue disappeared and then the pic- 
ture itself until finally he was left 
following tortuous convolutions in 



EARTHBLOOD 



143 




his own mind and it was a shaft of 
late afternoon sun, burning through 
a high window, that brought him to 
himself and made him blink hard to 
get the sun glimmers from his eyes. 

Some of the pictures were like the 
blue. Others seemed to project out 
from the walls, or were sheer pat- 
terns of light, hanging in empty air. 
And some — as Roan looked and 
noticed — some were pictures of Ter- 
ran places and houses and . 
people? The figures were so tiny and 
distant. Hunt though he did, he 
couldn’t find any close-ups of Ter- 
ran people. It didn’t really matter, 
though he really wanted to see it. 

Roan went on, walking right 
through a misty Light Picture in 
the middle of one of the rooms. 
All this. What was it for? Just to 
look at? Just to enjoy? 

It seemed a human way to be. A 
Terran way to do things. Roan felt 
a kinship with all this. He knew 
how to look at the paintings, how to 
enjoy the music. 

Then Roan walked into a room 
wide with windows, so that the 
sunshine shimmered clearly in it. 
Marble benches stood beneath the 
low windows and green plants hung 
over a scoop-«haped sunken pool. 
As Roan went over to stand on the 
edge of the empty pool there was a 
soft chick! and water began foam- 
ing into the pool. 

Roan laughed with pleasure. It 
was a bath! An enormously magni- 
fied version of one Stellaraire had 
had in her quarters with the ’zoo. 
He stripped off his shabby, ill-fitting 
tunic, realizing suddenly how dirty 
he was. 



He stood by a jet of soapy foam 
and scrubbed himself thoroughly. 
The pool carried off his dirt and 
dead skin cells in eddys of black and 
whirled in renewed, clean water. 
Roan luxuriated in die bath for an 
hour, watching the chasing clouds 
and the blue sky through the win- 
dows, and wondering at the delicate 
veining of the Terran plants that 
nodded over the water. 

And thought wistfully of Stellar- 
aire and how if she were here they’d 
splash water at each other and be 
foolish and afterwards walk in the 
garden and make love with timeless 
joy in the deep grasses. And live 
here forever in this enchanted place 
where there was no violence, no 
raspy, alien voices, no ugly, mis- 
shapen faces, no one hating or de- 
spising or envying Roan his Terran 
ancestry, his Terran inheritance. 

But there was no Stellaraire. Oily 
a memory that overfilled him now 
and then, like a bud with no room 
to open into a flower. 

B ehind a colored ^ass panel Roan 
found simply designed but beau- 
tiful clothes, of some woven mater- 
ial that sprang to fit him as he put 
it on. There were silver tigjiis fiiat 
fitted from his ankles to his waist 
and were cool to the touch. Then 
a short, silk-lined scarlet jacket, soft 
to the skin but stiff outside with goM 
and jewel embroidery. He foand 
boots that fitted softly like gloves, 
and protected his feet without heavy 
soles or heels. All this he put on, 
though there were other things. 
Thin white shorts and singlets and 
cloth short boots. 



144 



IF 




The only other thing Roan took 
was a magnificent, massive jewel, 
engraved TER. IMP. It hung around 
his neck from a gold chain and 
where it rested against his bare 
chest, between the edges of his scar- 
let jacket, it warmed him, almost 
seeming to throb like a beating 
heart. 

I look the way a Terran ought to 
look, Roan thought, looking at him- 
self in the enormous mirror that 
backed the door to the bathing 
room. The jewel glowed on his 
browned chest and his freshly 
washed hair clustered in dark red 
curls over his forehead. 

Roan wondered if a Terran would 
think him handsome. A Terran 
Woman. O gods, how long since 
he’d had a woman! 

Roan buckled back on his old link 
metal belt. He wondered why he 
thought it brought him luck, because 
it didn’t really. Then he reluctantly 
picked up the Mark XXX blaster. 
Here, it didn’t seem right. But he 
shoved it into the belt, which 
strained to hold it. 

Roan retraced his steps through 
still corridors, down to the echoing 
concourse, out onto the broad ter- 
race. 

Far in 'the sky the lowering sun 
flashed orange from the towers 
of the city — where Henry Dread 
was searching for loot now with his 
vicious crew of cut-throats. It was 
soiled, grubby — all of the Universe 
— but here it didn’t exist. He didn’t 
want to call it into being again. 

Roan took a new path, behind the 
house, walking quickly because he 
didn’t have much time left. Night 



was coming. He’d seen perhaps, 
most of what there was to see, and 
one more quick turn — 

Roan drew up short. 

Because reflected in a round mir- 
ror-pool, among fragile violet flow- 
ers, was a human Woman. 

She was flushed pink in the sun- 
set, pouring water from a long- 
neck^ jar. The water, sparkling 
pink, too, in the light, rippled over 
her slim neck, between her lifted 
breasts and around her softly bent 
body over her flanks, and finally 
ran murmuring into the mirror- 
pool, making no splash or ripple. 

“Oh, please,” Roan said, not 
meaning to s{>eak, and went up to 
the woman. But it was a statue, 
smiling its dreamy, carved smile, 
thinking the secret things of women. 

Roan reached out and touched the 
soft curve of the hard, marble 
cheek. 

And then far away came the vio- 
lent stutter of guns. Then a single 
shot. A power rifle. 

P erhaps it was the anger against 
life that filled him or perhaps 
it was a premonition of what was 
really happening, but Roan was run- 
ning. Along the curved paths and 
then straight across the middle of 
the park where there was a wide 
concourse and through a small grove 
where night had already come, and 
up the fence, holding to the nearest 
heavy vine, and slowing to be quiet 
now, along the fence to the tree. 

A gun rattled, paused, fired again. 
A voice shouted. 

Roan started down the tree. The 
streets were violet shadows now, the 



EARTHBLOOD 



145 




lowers bright-edged silhouettes 
against the orange and purple sky. 
There was a faint movement in the 
gloom below the tree and a face, 
a white blob in the darkness, looked 
up toward Roan, the glint of a knife 
in the teeth. 

There was a aharp hiss. Something 
chipped at the tiles and then another 
hiss and whoever it was starting up 
the tree fell back and slumped to 
the ground. 

Roan hefted the gun out of his 
belt. His Mark XXX that he’d aU 
but forgotten in the park. Well, that 
dream of peace was over now. 

Roan waited, heard a few shots, 
distant now, saw nothing moving. 
He dropped softly from the tree, 
squatted, turned the body on its 
back. The coarse, slack features of a 
bald Minid stared past him with 
dead, surprised eyes. The stump of 
a broken-off wooden shaft poked 
from the Minid’s chest just below 
the edge of the sheepskin vest. 

One of crew. A mean, dirty crea- 
ture, but somehow one of his. 

Roan stood, trying to see through 
the dark streets. The firing was be- 
coming steadier now, coming from 
locations to the north and east. A 
cold, evening wind blew up, and one 
brilliantly, orange star came out. 
Probably the next planet of the 
sun Aldo.. 

Roan crossed the street, started 
up pne of the dark avenues toward 
the north. Lights came on suddenly 
to illuminate the city; mists of light 
that seemed to hang in the air like 
clouds. 

There was a sharp hiss. Something 
struck the doorway of the house 



near Roan and clattered on the 
steps. Roan dropped, rolled, brought 
his gun around and fired at a figure 
bounding from the shadowed door- 
way across the street. The figure 
fell under the misting streetlight. 

Roan retreated to crouch in the 
angle between the steps and the Ter- 
ran house. Three long-legged, round- 
shouldered creatures emerged from 
the side street. He saw the thick, 
recurving bows in their hands, the 
lank hair that dangled beside their 
oddly flat faces, the heavy quivers 
slimg at their backs. They paused, 
fanning out. One saw the de^ bow- 
man, made a hoarse noise. At once, 
the three whirled, angled off quick 
ly in different directions. One was 
leaping toward Roan. He brought 
his gun up fired, swung and fired 
on a second savage as the first 
slammed to the curb of the mosaic 
sidewalk, almost at his feet. The sec- 
ond bowman reeled, stumbled, went 
down. Roan swung to the third and 
it dived for the black shadow of the 
building at the corner as his shot 
sent blue sparks from the door of 
the Terran house. 

Roan was up instantly, dashing 
for the corner, rounding it as a 
heavy arrow touched his shoulder, 
skipped high, flashed off into dark- 
ness. Roan skidded to a stop, 
stepped back to the corner, droppjed 
flat, thrust himself out. The native 
was charging from cover. Roan’s 
shot caught him full in the chest and 
he fell with a tremendous heavy 
slam an impact of utter finality. 

Roan let his breath out in a long 
sigh, slumped against the pavement, 
listening. There were no sounds, no 



146 



IF 




moving feet, no stealtiiy breathing, 
only the intemiittent rasp and 
crackle of guns, nearer now but still, 
he guessed, a street or two away. 

He got to his feet, moved off 
quickly, following a side street that 
would bring him to the scene of the 
action by a roundabout route. 

XXI 

F rom a low balcony which he had 
reached by clambering up the 
shadowed carved front of a peach- 
colored tower, Roan watched as a 
party of a dozen or so bowmen as- 
sembled almost directly below him 
in a narrow way. 

The sounds of firing came closer 
from along the wide avenue. Roan 
could see the blue flashes of power 
guns now, the yellow stabs of pellet 
throwers. Below, the leader of the 
ambushing party spoke, and his 
bowmen set arrows, crouching silent 
and ready. 

Down the avenue. Roan made out 
Henry Dread’s tall figure among a 
huddle of humanoids. There were 
not more than fifty in the party, he 
estimated — out of over eighty who 
had landed; a straggling band of 
cursing frightened raiders caught 
off-guard, retreating under a rain of 
arrows that flew from the darkness 
without flash or sound. A bald Min- 
id screeched, spun, fell kicking. The 
others passed Wm by, firing at ran- 
dom into the shadows, coming closer 
to the ambush. 

Below Roan, the bowmen gath- 
ered themselves. There was a single, 
grunted syllable from the leader. He 
stepped forward — 



Roan shot him, swept die gun 
across the others as they sprang 
back gaping. Three more fell, and 
the rest dashed for the deep shad- 
ows, disappeared between close 
walls. 

No one in the retiring ship’s party 
seemed to have noticed the by-play. 
They were formed up into a defen- 
sive ring, watching each side street 
as they passed. Henry Dread held 
up a hand, halted the group fifty 
feet from Roan^s vantage point. 
Lying on the balcony, he had a 
clear view of the pirates and the 
empty streets all around. 

“Belay firing!” Roan heard Henry 
Dread’s voice. “They’ve pulled back 
for now.” 

There were snarls and mutters 
from the crewmen. They shifted un- 
easily, watching the dark mouths of 
side streets. A gun winked blue, a 
harsh buzz against silence. 

“I said belay thaitl” Henry. Dread 
grated. “Well hold up here for ten 
minutes to give strag^rs a chance 
to join us.*

^ crewman who had fired his 
gun cut in. “We shoidd stay here 
and let these local ^obs simound 
us? Wo*re moving on — fast” 

••jaiut up, Snorgu,” Henry Dread 
snapped. ‘*Maybc you’ve forgotten I 
bust^ you out of a '^11 jail after 
you were dumb enough to get 
caught flat-footed strangling an old 
female for her nose-ruby. And now 
yot/re going to do the thinking for

**Your crew my hind leg, you 
lousy Terry. Wo^ taken enough

orders from your kind. What about 
it boys?” Snorgu glanced around at 
the watching pirates. 

Henry stepped up to the heavy- 
shouldered crewman. “Hand over 
your gun, Snorgu!” 

Snorgu faced Henry, the gun in 
his fist aimed at the pirate leader. 
He laughed. 

“I’m keeping my gun. And I’m 
firing when I feel like it.” 

A crewman beside Henry moved 
suddenly, caught the pirate captain’s 
arms from behind. Another struck 
out, knocked Henry’s gun from his 
hand. A third stooped, came up with 
it. 

“Here’s where we get a new cap- 
tain,” Snorgu growled. “Lead us into 
a ambush, hah? Some captain you 
are. I guess us Gooks have got just 
about a gut-full of fancy Terry 
ways.” 

“I seem to remember giving some 
orders about looting parties posting 
sentries,” Henry drawled. “And 
about skeleton crews on the Bolos.” 
Snorgu snaited and jammed the 
gun hard against Hwiry’s chest. 
“Never mind Hfl that Hand over the 
keys to the chart room and the 
strong box in your oabm.” 

Henry laughed, a hard sound like 
ice breaking. “You’re out of luck. 
You think I carry a bunch of keys 
around for stupid deck-apes like you 
to lift the first time you see a 
chance? They’re combination locks. 
Kill me and you’ll never get in.” 
“You’ll open ’em,” someone 
harked. “A couple needle-bums 
through the gut, and a couple of 
days for the rot to set in, and you’ll 
he screaming for somebody to listen 



to you sing, and all you’ll ask is a 
fast knife in the neck before your 
belly explodes.” 

“Meanwhile, how do you plan to 
get back to the ship?” Henry Dread 
cut in. “There might be a few na- 
tives between here and there that 
don’t want to see you run off after 
such a short stay.” 

“Gun him down,” someone sug- 
gested. “We’ve got enough on our 
hands without we got to watch this 
Terry.” 

“Sure. We can beam them locks 
open.” 

“Suits me.” Snorgu grinned, 
showing large, widely-spaced teeth 
in a loose-lipped mouth wide enough 
to put a hand in sideways. He 
stepped back a pace, angled the gun 
down at Henry’s belt-buckle — 

Roan took careful aim, shot Snor- 
gu through the head. 

T he pirate’s gun flew into the air 
as his hand jerked up; he stum- 
bled back and fell, and Henry 
stepped forward, caught the falling 
gun out of the air, held it aimed 
from the hip. The crewmen gaped. 

“Anybody else care to nominate 
himself captain?” Henry’s sharp 
voice cut acrass the silence. The 
men were craning their necks, look- 
ing for the source of the shot. Roan 
saw one ease a gun around, aim it 
at Henry Wread; Roan shot him 
through the chest. As he fell, an- 
other brought a gun up, and Henry, 
whirling, beamed him down. 

“Next?” he said pleasantly. No 
one moved. The crewmen stood 
stiffly now, cowed, worried. Henry 
laughed shortly, lowered his gun. 



148 



IF 




“All right, spread out in a skir- 
mish line and let’s get moving.” He 
motioned them past with his pistol. 
Roan lowered himself over the bal- 
ustrade and climbed quickly down. 
Henry Dread watched him come. 
His narrowed eyes were on the gun 
at Roan’s hip. “Learned to use it?” 

“Comes in handy,” Roan said cas- 
ually, imitating Henry Dread’s man- 
ner. He stood with his thumbs 
hooked in his belt, looking at the 
older man. Henry’s eyes went from 
Roan’s scarlet vest down the length 
of the silvery trousers, back up. His 
eyes locked with Roan’s. 

“You had a good chance to shoot 
me then,” he said. “But when it 
got right down to it, you sided me.” 
His face broke slowly into a smile. 
“I knew you’d figure out which side 
you were on, boy. You picked a 
good time. Something you learned 
in that park?” 

“I found a garden,,” Roan said. 
“It was perfect; the most perfect 
place I ever saw. I wanted to stay 
there. There was everything you 
could ever need. And then I saw a 
statue and I touched it, and all of 
a sudden I saw that it was all dead, 
frozen, just a fossil of something 
that was alive once. Something that 
could live again, maybe. I decided 
then. I want to make it live, Henry. 
I want to do whatever I have to do 
to make it come to life again. I want 
that stone girl to turn to living flesh 
and walk in that garden with me.” 

Henry’s band thrust out. Roan 
took it. “We’ll do it. Roan,” the 
pirate said. “Together, we’ll do it. 

Smiling, Roan said. “Want the 
gun back^ 



Hemy Dread’s smile was grim. 
“Keep it,” he^ said. “From now on, 
you walk behind me. Keep the gun 
on your hip, and your right hand 
loose.” 

He turned and followed the hud-, 
die of pirates, and Roan trailed him, 
walking with his head up, liking the 
feel of the heavy gun in his belt. 

XXII 

it'^T^hese past two years have been 
A good. Roan,” Henry Dread 
said, refilling his heavy wine mug. 
“Seven raids, all successful. Enough 
new men recruited to more than 
cover our losses; and our fuel and 
ammo reserves are at the best level 
in years.” 

Roan looked at his half-full glass 
sullenly. “And we’re still no closer 
to starting a new Terra than we ever 
were. We haven’t found even one 
more real Man to add to the roster. 
There’s still just you and me. Two 
Terries, two freaks, talking about 
what we’ll do some cfaty.” 

“Look here. Roan, weVc followed 
every rumor of a Terry we’ve run 
across. Is it my fault if they didn’t 
pan out? We’ll find a colony of 
Terries yet. And when we do — 

“Meanwhile Iron Robcrfs still 
chained. I want you to rdease him, 
Henry.” 

The pirate’s hand came down to 
slam the table. “Damn it, are we 
going to start into that again? 
Haven’t I explained to you that that 
man-eater’s a symbol aboard this 
vessel? My cut-throats saw him 
stand up to a blaster; they heard 
him threaten to pitch me through

the side of my own ship I And I 
let him live! As long as he’s chained 
to the wall his talk is just talk. 
Maybe a blaster can’t touch him, but 
Henry Dread has him under lock 
and key! But turn him loose — let 
him stamp around this ship a free 
Geek — well, you get the picture!” 

“I get the picture,” Roan said. 
“For over two years now I’ve been 
living off the fat of the land while 
my friend sits in the dark with half 
a ton of steel welded to his leg.” 

“Hell let’s be realistic, boy! He 
doesn’t mind it — not like you or I 
would! He says so himself. He sits 
and goes off into some kind of 
trance! Doesn’t even eat for days 
at a time. He’s not human Roan! 
By the Gods, with Man’s Galaxy 
at stake, you worry about one 
damned Geek!” 

“Set him free. He won’t cause 
any trouble. I’ll be responsible for 
him.” 

“That’s not the point,” Henry 
said in a hard voice. “You’d better 
settle for having him alive. He’s the 
first Geek I ever let live aboard my 
ship!” 

“That’s what your grand dream 
really boils down to, isn’t it, Henry? 
Killing Geeks.” 

Hei^ swiveled to stare into the 
view screen that curved above the 
command console. “Somewhere out 
there, there’s i Niss warship,” he 
said quietly. “We’re closing the gap. 
Roan. The stories we’ve picked up 
these last couple of months all tell 
the same tale. The Niss ship is real, 
and it’s not far off. We’ll pick it 
up on our long-range screens any 
day now.” 



“More Geeks to kill. That’s all 
it is. It isn’t a war; the Niss were 
beaten — at least as much as the 
Empire. They’re no threat to us or 
to anybody. They haven’t attacked 
anyone.” 

Henry swung back. “Haven’t 
they? What about the Mandevoy 
.patrol boat they vaporized last year 
at a range of twelve thousand 
miles?” 

“The Mandevoy went out looking 
for trouble. They admitted that. The 
Niss haven’t attacked a planet, or 
any ship that stayed clear of them. 
Let’s forget the Niss. It’s Terra we’re 
interested in. Let’s look for Terra.” 

4 4^"T^rra!” Henry snorted. “Don’t 
-L you know that’s just a 
name. Roan? A mythical wonder- 
land for the yokels lo tell stones 
about! TTie Terran Empire isn’t 
some two-bit world somewhere at 
the far side of the Galaxy. It’s hu- 
manity — organized, armed and in 
charge!” 

“There is a Terra,” Roan said. 
“And some day I’ll find it. If you’ve 
given up on it. I’ll find it alone.” 
“Given up!” Henry Dread roar- 
ed, coming to his feet. “Henry 
Dread never gave up on anything 
he set out to do! I’m not chasing 
rainbows! I’m fighting a live enemy! 
I’m facing reality! Maybe it’s time 
you grew up and did the same!” 
Roan nodded. “You’re right. Just 
set me down on the next inhabited 
world with my share of the sp>oils. 
I’ll leave your grand scheme to you; 
I’ve got a better one of my own.” 
Henry’s eyes were fierce fires 
blazing in a face purple with fury.

thing, Henry,’’ Roan cut in, his 
blue eyes holding the pirate’s. They 
stood face to face, two big, power- 
fully built men, one with gray hair 
and a face of lined leather, the 
other with a mane of dark red 
curls hacked short, the clean fea- 
tures of youth, a flawless com- 
plexion marred only by a welted 
scar along his right cheek where 
Ithc’s talons had raked him, long 
ago. 

“But you’ve taken plenty!’’ 

“I was content with the ’zoo. I 
had friends there. A girl, too.’’ 

Henry Dread snarled. “You’ll be- 
friend any lousy Gook or Geek that 
gives you the time of day. But me, 
a Commander in the Imperial Ter- 
ran Navy — I’m not good enough 
for your friendship!’’ 

Roan’s expression changed. He 
frowned. 

“You said — the Imperial Ter- 
ran Navy.’’ 

Henry Dread’s eyes held steady. 
“That’s what I said,” he grated. 

“I thought,” Roan said carefully, 
watching Henry Dread’s eyes, “that 
the ITN was wiped out, thousands 
of years ago.” 

“You did, eh?” Henry was smiling 
a tight, hard smile. He looked at 
Roan bright-eyed, enjoying the mo- 
ment. “\^^at if I told you it wasn’t 
wiped out? What if I said there were 



intact units scattered all over ihe 
Eastern Arm when the shooting 
stopped? What if I said Rim Head-- 
quarters had taken over command 
control, reorganized the survivors, 
and held the Navy together — 
waiting for the day a counter-attack 
could be launched?’’ 

**Are you saying that?’’ Roan tri^ 
to hold his voice level and calm, 

“Hell, boy, that’s what I called 
you up here to talk about, before 
you started in on your pet Geek!’’ 
Henry clapped Roan’s shoulder. 
“I’ve watched you close, these last 
years. You’ve done all right. Roan 
— better than all right. It’s time I 
let you in on what you’re doing 
here. What we’re doing. You 
thought I was just a pirate, raiding 
and looting just for the hell of it, 
getting fat off the leavings of Geeks 
and Gooks. And you thought my 
talk about getting the Galaxy back 
for Man was just talk. I know.” He 
laughed, with his hands on his hips 
and his head thrown back. 

“I can’t say I blame you. Sure, 
I’ve got a hold full ci h^vy metal 
and gem crystals and old Terry cloth 
and spices and even a few cases of 
Old Imperial Credit tokens. But 
that’s not all I’ve got tucked away. 
Come here.” 

He turned, walked across the 
broad command deck of the ancient 
battle-wagon, tapped keys cm the 
panel. An armored door swung 
open, and Henry stepped inside, 
ducking his head, came out with a 
wide, flat box. He lifted the lid 
with a flourish, held up a garment 
of close-woven blue polyon, shook 
it out. Roan gaped.

“My uniform,” Henry Dread said. 
“As a Commander in the Imperial 
Teiran Navy. I’m assigned to re- 
cruiting and fund-raising duty. I’ve 
done all rig^t as far as funds are 
concerned. But this is my first re- 
QFuitiment.” 

Roan’s hungry eyes held on the 
rich doth, the ^tter of ancient in- 
signia. He swallowed, opened his 
mouth to speak — 

Henry Dread stepped back into 
the vault, came out holding a second 
box in his hands. He tucked it un- 
der one arm. 

“Raise your right hand. Lieuten- 
ant Comay,” he said. 

R oan stared into the mirror. The 
narrow-cut, silver corded black 
trousers fitted without a wrinkle in- 
to the brightly polished ship-boots. 
Over the white silk shirt, the short 
tunic was a swirl of braid, a gleam 
of silver buttons against royal blue. 
A bright-plated ebony-grip]^ cere- 
monial side-arm winked at each hip 
against the broad woven-silver belt 
with the big, square buckle adorned 
by the carv^ TER. IMP. and bird 
symbol. 

He turned to Henry Dread. “I’ve 
got about a milli ard questions, 
Henry. You know what they are.” 
Henry Dread lauded again. 
“Sure, I know.” He keyed a mike, 
snapped out an order for a bottle 
and glasses, “Sit down. Lieutenant. 
I think you can forget about Geeks 
for a few minutes now while I tell 
you a few things.” 

I ron Robert stirred as Roan called 
to him. His heavy feet scraped 



the rusted deck-plates; chairks clash- 
ed in the gloom and his green eyes 
winked open. 

“What you want. Roan,” the 
heavy voice growled. “You wake 
Iron Robert from dream of youth 
and females and hot sun of home- 
world.” 

“I . just came to see how you 
are,” Roan said. “I’ve been busy 
lately. I guess I haven’t gotten down, 
to see you as often as I’d like. Is 
there anything you need?’^ 

“Just need to know you well and 
happy. Roan. I think now you and 
Henry Dread friends, you have good 
time, not be so sad like before.” 
Roan gripped the two-inch chro- 
malloy bars of Iron Robert’s cell. 
“It’s not just a good time, Iron 
Robert. I’m doing something. I’m 
helping to put the Terran Empire 
back together. I know, it’s not much 
— just one ship, cruising space, 
looking for Terrans, or rumors of 
Terrans, and collecting funds for the 
Navy, gathering intelligence to use 
when we’re ready to launch our 
counter-attack.” 

“Counter-attack against who. 
Roan? You already attack all Gooks 
and Geeks you find, take all guns 
and fuel and money.” 

“You have to understand, Iron 
Robert! We’re not just looting. We 
need those things! We’re cruising 
according to official Navy orders, 
hitting every world in our assigned 
sector. Captain Dread’s already been 
out twelve years. Two more years, 
and we finish the sweep, and report 
back to Rim Headquarters.” 

“Just so you happy, Roan. Have 
good time, live to full, eat good. 



152 



IF 




drink good, have plenty fight, plenty 
women.” 

“Damn it, is that all living means 
to you? Don’t you understand what 
it is to try to build something big- 
ger than you are, something worth 
giving everything that’s in you for?” 
“Sure, Roan. Iron Robert under- 
stand big dreams of youth. All be- 
ings young once.” 

“ITiis isn’t just a dream! The 
Terran Empire ruled this Galaxy 
once, and could rule it again! 
Haven’t you seen enough suffering 
and torture and death and indiffer- 
ence and ruins and greed and hate 
and hopelessness to understand how 
it is to want to change all that? The 
Empire will bring back peace and 
order. If we left it to the damned 
Geeks it would go on like this 
forever, only worse!” 

“Maybe true, Roan.” Iron Rob- 
ert’s voice was a soft rumble. 
“Fine thing, build towers up into 
•unlight, squirt water, make pretty 
•ounds.” 

“Don’t make fun of my garden! 
I shouldn’t have told you about it! 
I might have known a Geek couldn’t 
understand!” 

“Hard thing for Geek to under- 
stand, Roan. What place Geeks have 
in Terry Empire? Geeks get to walk 
in pretty garden too?” 

“The Geeks will have their own 
worlds,” Roan said sullenly. ‘They’ll 
have their own gardens.” 

“Iron Robert have garden once 
too. Roan. Fine black stones, and 
pools of soft mud to lie in, and hot, 
stinky water come up out of ground. 
But I think Roan not like my gar- 
den. I think hard thing for Roan 



and Iron Robert to walk in garden 
together, talk over old times. Maybe 
better have no garden, just be to- 
gether, friends.” 

Roan leaned his head against the 
cold bars. “Iron Robert, I didn’t 
mean — I mean — we’ll always be 
friends, no matter what! I know 
you’re locked in here because of me. 
Listen, Iron Robert, I’m going to 
tell Henry Dread — ” 

“Roan not tell Henry Dread any- 
thing! Iron Robert made deal with 
pirate. Geek keep word as good as 
Man.” 

“I didn’t mean it when I called 
you a Geek, Iron Robert — ” 

“Just word. Roan. Iron Robert 
and Roan friends, few angry words 
nothing. Iron Robert not shamed to 
be Geek. Fine thing to be royal fer- 
rous strain and have friend like 
Roan. Human flame bum short but 
bum hot, warm <Ad stone heart of 
being Hke Iron Robert.” 

“I’m ^ing to get you out of 
there!” 

“No, Roan. Where else I go? Not 
like Terry cabin, too small, too weak 
chair. And only cause trouble. 
Henry Dread right. Crew not like 
see Iron Robert free being. Better 
wait here, be near Roan, and some 
day maybe we make planetfall to- 
gether. Meantime, you got destiny 
to work out with Henry Dread. You 
go ahead, chase dream of ancient 
glories. Iron Robert be here by 
and by.” 

“We’ll be at Rim HQ soon — in 
a year or two. m make them give 
me a ship of my own then. And 
you’ll be my second-in-command!” 
“Sure, Roan. Good jrfan. Till

then. Iron Robert wait patient — 
and Roan not worry/’ 

XXIII 

R oan stood up, stretched, rubbed 
his eyes, drained the mug of 
bitter brown coffee, clattered the 
empty cup down on the chart table. 

“Fm tired, Henry. Over thirty- 
six hours we’ve been hanging over 
the screens, and we’ve seen nothing. 
Let’s admit it’s another wild-goose 
chase and turn in.” 

‘They’re close. Roan,” Henry 
snapped. His face was grayish and 
hoUow in the lights of the panel. 
“I’ve chased the Niss for forty 
years. Another forty minutes and 
maybe FU see them in my sights.” 
“Or another forty days. Or forty 
years, or a thousand, for all we 
know. Those clod-'hoppers back on 
Ebar probably just gave us the story 
to get rid of us before the boys get 
bored and started shooting the town 
up again." 

“They’re out there. We’ll close 
with them this time.” 

“And if they are — what about 
it? We’re on a recruiting and fund- 
raising mission, aren’t we? What’s 
that got to do with launching one- 
man attacks against Niss warships? 
If there is any ship." 

“They’re there, I said! And we’re 
a Naval ship of the line! It’s al- 
ways pur job to seek out and destroy 
the enemy!” 

“Henry, give it up. We don’t 
know their capabilities. I know 
we’ve got special long-range in- 
detectable radar gear, but they 
may still blast us out of space like 



they did that Mandevoy scout a few 
years ago, before we even get close.” 

Henry Dread whirled, stared up 
at Roan from his seat. “Scared, 
Lieutenant?” 

Roan’s tired face smiled humor- 
lessjy. “Sure, I’m scared, if that’s 
what you want to hear. Or maybe 
I’ve just got common sense enough 
not to want to see all you’ve work- 
ed for — all we*ve worked for — 
destroyed just because you’ve got 
the itch to fire those big batteries 
you’ve been keeping primed all these 
years.” 

Henry Dread came to his feet. 
“TTiat’s enough out of you. Mister! 
I’m still in charge aboard this tub! 
Now get on that screen until I give 
the order to leave your post!” 

“Slow down, Henry — ” 

“Commander Dread to you. Mis- 
ter!” Henry’s face was close to 
Roan’s, his square jaw, marred by a 
slight sagging of the jowls, thrust 
out. Roan straightened, settled his 
gun-belt on his hips. He was an 
inch taller than Dread, and almost 
as heavy through the shoulders. He 
looked the older man steadily in 
the eye. 

“We’re just nine months out of 
Rim Headquarters, Henry. Let’s see 
if we can’t get there in one piece. 
Both of us.” 

Henry Dread’s hand went to his 
gun. He half drew it, looking into 
Roan’s eyes, his teeth set in a snari. 

“I gave you an order!” 

“You’re a big enough man to 
take an order back, when you see 
it’s a mistake,” Roan said flatly. 
“We both need rest. I know a couple 
of crewmen who’d like to see the 



154 



IF 




pair of us out on our feet.” He 
turned away. Henry Dread’s gun 
cleared the holster. 

“Stop right there, Mister!” 

A clanging alarm shattered the 
stillness into jagged fragments. 
Roan spun. His eyes leaped to 
the long-range screen. A bright 
point of blue light glowed near the 
lower left corner. He jumped to 
the panel, twisted knobs; the image 
centered. He read figures from a 
ground-glass plate. 

“Mass, five point seven million 
Standard Tons; velocity, point oh- 
nine light, absolute; nine-eighty 
MPH relative!” 

“By the Nine Devils, that’s it!” 
Henry Dread’s voice choked. He 
stared across at Roan, then grabbed 
up the command mike, bawled into 
k: 

“All hands, battle stations! Se- 
cure for action! All batteries, full- 
arm and count-down! Power section, 
stand by for maximum drain!” 

A startled voice acknowledged as 
he tossed the mike aside, looked 
across at Roan. His eyes were wide, 
bright. 

“This is it. Roan! That’s a Niss 
ship of the line, as sure as I’m 
Henry Dread!” His eyes went on 
the screen. “Look at him! Look at 
the size of that devil! But we’ll take 
him out! We’ll take him!” He bol- 
stered his gun, drew a breath, turn- 
ed to Roan. 

“For the first time in five thou- 
sand years, a ship of the Imperial 
Navy is engaging the enemy! This 
is the hour I’ve lived for. Roan! 
We’ll smash them like a ripe fruit!” 



He raised his clenched fist. “And 
then nothing will stop us! Are you 
with me, boy?” 

Roan’s eyes held the long shape 
growing on the screen. “Let’s break 
it off, Henry. We’ve established that 
we can get in range, and we have 
them located. When we reach Rim 
Headquarters, we can ...” ^ 

“Damn Rim Headquarters!” 
Henry Dread roared. -“This is my 
action! I tracked that filthy blot 
on the human sky halfway across 
the Eastern Arm, and now I’m go- 
ing to burn it clean!” 

“You’re out of your mind, 
Henry,” Roan snapped. “The 
damned thing outweighs us a hund- 
dred to one.” 

“Crazy, am I? I’ll show you how 
a crazy man deals with the scum 
that challenged Terran power at its 
peak!” 

Roan gripped Henry’s shoulders, 
eyes on the screen. “It’s not just 
you and me, Henry! We’ve got 
eighty crewmen below! They trust 
in you.” 

•To hell with those Cooks! This 
is what I was bom for!” He broke 
off. A tremor rattled the coffee mug 
on the table. There was a sudden 
sense of pressure, of impending vio- 
lence — 

The deck rose up and struck 
Roan a mighty blow. 

Instrument faces burst from the 
panel, screens exploded in smoke 
and white light. He had a glimpse 
of Henry Dread, spinming past him. 
A thunderous blast rolled endless- 
ly, and then it drained away and 
Roan was whirling in echoing si- 
lence.

H e was on the floor, looking up 
at a soot-smeared figure in 
rags, bleeding from a hundred cuts, 
hunched in the command chair, 
square fists clamped on the fire- 
control levers. Roan coughed, raised 
himself on one elbow, got to his 
hands and knees. The walls spun 
dizzily. 

“How bad are we hit?” he choked. 
“Filthy, sneaking Niss,” Henry 
Dread (Wanted. “Let ’em have an- 
other broadside! Bum the devils out 
of the sky!” 

Roan’s eyes swept over the shat- 
tered panel, the smashed instru- 
ments, fixed on the controls in 
Henry Dread’s hands. They hung 
slack and useless from broken 
mountings. 

“Henry, let’s get out of here. 
The lifeboats . .** 

“Maximum beam,” Henry Dread 
shouted. “Forward batteries, fire! 
Fire, damn you!” 

“We’ve got to get out.” Roan 
staggered to his feet, grasped 
Henry’s shoulder, pulling his away 
from the devastated control console. 
“Give the older!” 

Wild eyes in a white face stared 
up at him. “Are you a fighting man 
of the Empire or a dirty Geek- 
loving spy?” Henry tore himself 
free, hinged for the command mike, 
dangling from its socket. 

“All hands*! We’re closing with 
the enemy! Prepare to board.” 
Roan tore the mike from Henry. 
“Abandon ship!” he shouted — 
and threw the dead mike from him 
as Henry yelled, swung a wild blow. 
He leaned aside, caught the other’s 
wrists. 



“Listen to me, Henry! We’ve got 
lo get to the boats! We can sur- 
vive to fight again!” 

Henry stared into Roan’s eyes, 
breathing hard. Swelling blisters 
puffed the left side of his face. His 
hair was singed to curled stubble. 
There was blood at the (Corner of 
his mouth. Quite suddenly, the wild- 
ness went out of his eyes. His arms 
relaxed; he staggered, caught him- 
self. 

“Two boats,” he mumbled. “I’ve 
fitted ’em out as raiders. Armor, an 
infinite repeater each, two torpe^ 
dos . .” He pulled free of Roan’s 
grip, pus-hed past him toward the 
lift doors, stumbling over the debris 
littering the deck. 

“We’re not beaten yet,” he was 
shouting again. “Slip through their 
screens — hit ’em in close — ” 
Smoke swirled from the lift as the 
doors clashed open. Henry Dread 
lurched inside, and Roao followed. 

O n the boat deck, a dense-packed 
mob of shouting, struggling 
crewmen fought for position at the 
two escape looks. 

“It’s Captain DreadP someone 
yelled. 

“Here’s the Terry swine now!” 
“Open up!” 

“Get the boats clear!” 

Henry slammed his way through 
the press, gun in hand. He smashed 
it down over the skull of a homed 
bruiser in blackened sheepskin, 
whirled to face the mob. Behind 
them, the glare of raging fires 
danced against the bulkhead visible 
at the eiKi of the long corridor. 
“Listen to me, you swabs,” Henry 



156 



IF 




roared. “There’s room in the two 
boats for every gutter-spawned ras- 
cal here — but by the nine tails of 
the fire-devil, you’ll form up and 
board in a shipshape fashion or fry 
where you are! You there! Gungle! 
Let him be! Get back there! Askor! 
i#5ke number one port!” The pirate 
bellowed his orders, and the 
frantic crewmen broke off their 
struggles, moved back, taking places 
in two ragged lines. 

Roan pushed through them, 
coughing, blinking through the 
smoke. 

“Here, where do you think you’re 
going!” Henry Dread bellowed after 
him. But Roan was clear of the 
press, into the transverse corridor 
now. The smoke was less here. He 
ran, bounded down a companion- 
way, leaped the crumpled form of 
a Minid with a short toife standing 
in his back. Someone’s grudge 
settled, Roan thought as he da^ed 
along the cargo level way. 

He skidded to a halt at Iron 
Robert’s cell. Through the layered 
smoke, he made out the massive 
figure, seated stolidly on the steel- 
slab bench. 

“Iron Robert! I’ll get you out! 
The keys are in Henry’s cabin — 
“Just minute. Roan," the rum- 
bling voice said calmly. “What hap- 
pen? Iron Robert w^e, hear en- 
gines dead, plenty smoke in room.” 
“We tried to attack a Niss war- 
ship! It hit us before we even got 
close, smashed our screens, burned 
out our circuitry. We’re a hulk, on 
fire. We’re abandoning ship!” 

“You want Iron Robert go free 
out of cell? Don’t need key. Roan. 



Easy.” The giant stood, brought his 
massive arms forward and snapped 
the chains as easily as loops of wet 
paper. He stooped, tore the ankle 
chains from the wall, then peeled 
the massive collars from his ankles. 

“Stand back. Roan.” He stepped 
to the grating, gripped the wrist- 
thick bars, ripped them aside with 
a screech of metal, forced his nine- 
foot bulk through the opening like a 
man brushing aside a beaded hang- 
ing, and stood in the corridor, look- 
ing down at Roan. 

“You could have broken them any 
time,” Roan stuttered. “You stayed 
there — in chains — for five years, 
on my account.” 

“Good place as any to sit, think. 
Now fire grow hot. Time to go, 
Roan.” 

R oan whirled, led the way along 
the smoke-fogged corridor, up 
the companionway, along to the boat 
deck. Half the crew had entered 
the lifeboats now. Two dead men 
lay on the deck. Wasted at short 
range by Henry Dread’s guns. The 
grizzled Terran cau^t sight of 
Roan. 

“You’re taking number two boat! 
Where in the nine Hells have you 
been?” Iron Robert lumbered from 
the smoke behind Roan. 

“So! I should have figured!” TTic 
gun swiveled to cover the giant 
“Get aboard. Roan! We’re running 
out of time!” 

“ITl load when my crew’s load- 
ed.” Roan walked past Henry, ig- 
noring the gun, to the gangway 
where burly humanoids pushed, 
crowding through the port. 



EARTHBLOOD

“I said get aboard I” Henry bel- 
lowed. 

There were half a dozen more 
crewmen. They pushed, shouting. 
Answering shouts came from inside 
the sixty-foot boat, cradled in its 
massive davits in the echoing, 
smoke-filled hold. A broad-faced 
Minid thrust his head from the 
lock of number one boat. 

“We got a full load!” he roared. 
“You load any more in here, they’ll 
be standin’ on each others’ shoul- 
ders!” 

Henry’s gun swung. “I don’t care 
if you have to stack ’em like cord- 
wood! Get ’em in, Askor!” He spun 
back to face Roan. “What the hell 
are you waiting for, boy? Get 
aboard that boat — now! Can’t you 
feel that heat? This tub will blow 
any second.” 

“Iron Robert,” Roan called past 
him. “Go aboard.” 

“There’s no room for the hulk!” 
Henry shouted. “That was an order, 
Mister!” 

Three frantic crewmen struggled 
at the port of Number two boat. 

“No more Tooml** a hoarse voice 
bellowed from inside the lock. A 
broad foot swung out, kicked at 
one of the men. He fell from the 
gangway, and the two behind leap- 
ed forward. A fight developed in 
the lock. Henry Dread took a step, 
aimed, fired once, twice, a third 
time. Two dead crewmen fell, rolled 
off onto the hot deckplates. A third 
was lifted, tossed from inside. 

“Fight your way in there. Roan,” 
Henry yelled. “Shoot as many as 
you have to!” 

“Iron Robert — ” 



“I said he’s not going aboard!” 

Roan and Henry Dread faced 
each other, ten feet apart across 
the blood-spattered deck. The pirate 
captain’s gun was aimed unwaver- 
ingly at Roan’s chest. 

“He goes or I stay,” Roan yelled 
above the clamor. 

“For the last time — follow your 
orders!” Henry bellowed. 

“Iron Robert, go aboard!” Roan 
started. 

“Roan — ” Iron Robert ' took a 
step, and Henry Dread wheeled. 
Blue fire lanced, splashed harmless- 
ly from Iron Robert’s chest. 

“You board boat, like Henry 
Dread say. Roan,” the giant rum- 
bled. 

Henry took a step backward, his 
gun covering Roan again. 

“Listen to Iron Man,” Henry 
grated. “He’s telling you.” 

“Let him board, Henry!” Roan 
said. 

“Over my dead body,” Henry 
grated. “Not even you can — ” 

“Roan, no!” Iron Robert cried — 

I n a motion too quick to follow. 
Roan’s hand had flashed to his 
gun, brought it up, fired, and the 
the pirate leader was staggering 
back, his knees folding, the gun 
dropping from his hand. 

He seemed to fall slowly, like an 
ancient tree. He struck, rolled over, 
lay on his back with his eyes and 
mouth open, smoke rising from a 
charred wound on his chest. 

“Roan! You big fool! No room 
on boat for Iron Robert! Now you 
kill Henry Dread, true Man ^o 
love you like son!”

Roan tossed the gun aside, went 
to the fallen pirate, knelt beside 
him. “Henry . His voice caught 
in his throat. “I thought — ” 

“You wrong. Roan,” Iron Robert’s 
voice rumbled. “Henry Dread not 
shoot you in million years. Try 
save your life, foolish Roan. You 
go now, quick, before ship explode.” 

Henry Dread’s open eyes flicker- 
ed. They moved to Roan’s face. 

“You ... in conumand . now,” 
he gasped. “Maybe . right . 
Iron Man . okay . .” He drew 
a ragged breath and coughed, tried 
to speak, coughed again. “Roan,” 
he managed. “Terra . .” The light 
died from his eyes like a mirror 
steaming over. 

“Henry!” Roan shouted. Two 
hands like ship’s grapples clamped 
on his arms, lifted him, thrust him 
toward the port. 

“You go now. Roan, live, have 
long life, do, see many things. Think 
sometime of Iron Robert, and not be 
sad. Be happy. Remember many 
good times together.” 

“No, Iron Robert! You’re com- 
ing!” 

“No room. Iron Robert too big, 
not squeeze through port.” Roan 
felt himself propelled through the 
narrow opening into the noise and 
animal stinfc of the crowded life- 
boat. He fought to regain his feet, 
turned to see the wide figure of 
Iron Robert silhouetted against the 
blazing corridor. He lunged for the 
port, and a dozen pairs of homy 
hands caught at him, held him as 
he kicked and fought. 

“You got to navigate this tub, 
Terry,” someone yelled. 



“Dog down that port,” another 
shouted. Roan had a last glimpse 
of Iron Robert as hands hauled him 
back. The heavy port swung shut. 
Then he was thrust forward, passed 
from one to another, and then he 
was stumbling into the command 
compartment. Rough hands shoved 
him into the navigator’s chair. The 
cold muzzle of a gun rammed 
against his cheek. 

“Blast us out of here, fast,” a 
heavy voice growled. Roan shook 
himself, forced his eyes to focus 
on the panel. As in a dream, his 
hands went out, threw levers, punch- 
ed keys. The screens glowed into 
life. 

Against the black of space, the 
long shape of the inamense Niss 
war vessel glowed no more than a 
thousand miles distant, its unlighted 
bulk blotting out the stars. 

Roan gathered himself, sat up- 
right. His teeth were set in a grim 
caricature of a smile. He twirled 
dials, centered the image in the 
screen, read numerals from an in- 
strument, punched a code into the 
master navigator panel, then with a 
decisive gesture thrust home the 
main drive control.

R oan slumped in the padded seat, 
let his hands fall from the con- 
trols. 

“We’re clear,” he said dully. “I 
don’t think the other boat got away. 
I don’t see it on our screens.” 

A clay-faced creature with the 
over-long arms and the tufted bris- 
tles of a Zorgian pushed through

the crew packed like salted fish in 
the bare functional shell. 

“Listen to me, you muck-worms,” 
he hooted in the queer, resonant 
voice that rose from his barrel- 
chest. “If we wanta make planet- 
fall, we got to organize this scow.” 
“Who asked you?” a gap-tooth- 
ed, olive-skinned crewman demand- 
ed. “I been thinking, and — ” 

“I’m senior Gook here,” a bald, 
wrinkled Minid barked. “Now we’re 
clear, we got to find the nearest 
world.” 

“If we don’t wanta all die,” a 
hoarse voice yelled, “we got to pick 
a new Cap’n!” 

“I won’t have no lousy Minid 
telling me — ” 

“Button yer gill^lits, you throw- 
back to a mud-fish — ” 

Roan stood, turned on the men. 
“All right,” he roared — an as- 
tonishing shout that cut through the 
hubbub like a whiplash through cot- 
ton cloth. 

“You can belay all this gab about 
who’s in charge! I am! If you bone- 
heads can stop squabbling long 
enough to let a few facts into your 
skulls, youll realize we’re in trou- 
ble. Bad trouble!” 

The Zorgian bellied up to Roan. 
“Listen, you Terry milk-sop — 
Roan hit the humanoid with a 
gut-punch, straightened him out with 
an upward slain of a hard fist, push- 
ed him back among the crewmen. 

“We>e got no discharge look,” 
he grated, “so if anybody gets him- 
self killed, the rest of us will have 
to live with the remains; think that 
over before you start any trouble.” 



Roan planted his fists on his hips. 
He was as tall as the tallest of the 
cut-throat crew, a head taller than 
the average. His black-red hair was 
vivid in the harsh light of the glare 
strip that lit the crowded compart- 
ment. Coarse faces, slack with 
fright, stared at him. 

“How many of you have guns?” 
he demanded. There was muttering 
and shuffling. Roan counted hands. 

“Sixteen. How many knives?” 
There was another show gf hands, 
gripping blades that ranged from a 
broad, edge-nicked machete to a 
cruel, razor-edged hook. 

“Where are we going?” someone 
called. 

“We’ll die aboard this can,” a 
shrill cry came. 

“We can’t make planetfall.” 
Roan’s voice blanketed the others. 
“We’re a long way from home, with- 
out fuel reserves or supplies.” The 
crew were silent now, waiting. “But 
we’ve got our firepower intact. 
There are two thousand^megaton 
torps slung below decks and we 
mount a ten mm infinite repeater 
for’ard. And there’s food, water, 
fuel and air just a few miles away.” 
He stepped aside, pointed to the for- 
ward screen, where the Niss ship 
swelled now to giant size. 

“We’re inside her defenses now,” 
he said. ‘"They won’t be expecting 
any visitors in a hundred ton 
dinghy.” 

“What do you mean?” a one-eyed 
man growled. “You’re asking — ” 

“I’m asking nothing,” Roan said 
harshly. “I’m telling you we’re going 
in to attack the Niss ship.”

Dear Editor: 

In the November issue of //, in 
Gordon Dickson^s story, Tiger 
Green, I noticed a rather glaring 
error. The paragraph reads as fol- 
lows: 

‘‘Slowly Milt lifted his gaze from 
the fallen man and faced Terry. It 
was the standard seventy-two de- 
grees Centigrade in the room, but 
Jerry saw perspiration standing out 
on Milt^s face as if he had just 
stepped out of a steam bath.” 

A minor point that does not de- 
tract from the over-all high quality 
of the magazine — but let^s keep 
authors and editor on their toes! — 

Edward Wilton.

Dear Editor: 

As a high school student myself, 
I must disagree with S, Alan 
Simon. In the school I go to, I know 
of only two boys and a teacher who 
read science fiction with any degree 
of regularity. I have tried many 
times without success to make con- 
verts to science fiction among my 
friends, but every one of them 
seems to equate it with such things 
as The Creature from the Black 
Lagoon or I Was a Teenage Were- 
wolf. It isn^t greatly loved among 
teenagers because most of them 



don’t know what it really is. Sure 
it produces stories like A Canticle 
for Leihowitz but how many people 
have ever heard of that story? 

About your editorial Air and 
Space: it seems to me that many 
of the “UFOlogists” have taken on 
the appearance of a cult. I have 
read a number of books on the sub- 
ject both pro and con, and by far 
the ones which made the most sense 
were those against. Every book I 
read defending UFOs was either 
limited to viciously attacking the 
Air Force or of the “contactee,” 
group. 

As to the formers’ claim that 6,- 
000 reporters can’t all be wrong, 
this is my reply: I think that Orson 
Welles is responsible for a good 
deal of today’s UFO sightings. Ever 
since he did that War of the Worlds 
program people have seen things in 
the sky. Another factor in the con- 
troversy is what I’ll call The Amer- 
ican Mind. This is the way tiiat 
millions of plain ordinary people 
react to something mysterious. 
America is notorious for Ihe gulli- 
bility of its people. An American 
will read someplace that scientists 
believe there is life on other plan- 
ets. He will then remember a hor- 
ror movie he saw once in which 



161 




Earth was invaded by hordes of 
slavering BEM's. Now he is left 
with the impression that anything 
that comes out of outer space is nat- 
urally going to be hostile. Then, 
along comes some saucer enthusiast 
who tells him that we are in the 
process of being visited by crea- 
tures from outer space who are 
friendly. This is vastly more com- 
forting to him than the previous. 
So now he will desperately want to 
see one of these flying saucers and 
because he wants to he will. I im- 
agine it's something like the Place- 
bo Effect. I'm almost willing to bet 
that whatever UFO reports can't 
be explained as they have been in 
the past can be explained in this 
manner. 

By the way, what frequency does 
WNBC operate on? I'd like to tune 
in on that program sometime. 

Keep the Retief stories coming. 
I really enjoy that series; I think 
it's one of the best in science fiction 
today. I can't understand what any- 
one sees in the Gree stories, though. 
I read three of them, and frankly, 
I was rather bored. 

One last thing: we know now that 
what the ancients used to call mir- 
acles were often what we now call 
UFOs. I wonder if we aren't in the 
same position as they were. We see 
something in the sky and try to ex- 
plain it in terms of our present 
knowledge, but we really don't know 
just what it is. Perhaps the UFOs 
are something which is as far be- 
yond our understanding as a space- 
ship "would have been to a caveman. 
— Alan McArdle, 6 Nancy Rd., Con- 
cord, Mass.

Dear Editor: 

Any further suggestion on how 
to improve your magazine would be 



futile. After going up 32 pages and 
not going up on price, who can com- 
plain? Good work! 

The idea of a story rating/read- 
ers' choice for some sort of prize 
— as is done elsewhere and has 
geen suggested by some as an in- 
clusion in your format — is impossi- 
ble. Who can make distinctions be- 
tween such absolute top writers as 
you have had in the last year or 
so? 

A regional Southeast United 
States science-fiction organization 
may be formed. Anyone interested 
can obtain more information by 
writing me and waiting for me to 
get home from college to answer 
them. 

One question : Is Cordwainer 

Smith a pseudonym Irvin Koch, 

835 Chattanooga Bank Building, 
Chattanooga, Tennessee 37916. 

# He is not a pseudonym for any 
other science-fiction writer, if that's 
what you mean — but it's true that 
•'Cordwainer Smith" is not the name 
this author was born with. — Editor

Dear Editor: 

I think C. C. MacApp's new novel. 
Prisoners of the Sky, was excellent. 
It read like an aerial Horatdo Horn- 
blower, and I hope you print a se- 
quel . — Daniel R. Mercer, 2 Belmont 
Lane, Willinghoro, New Jersey, 

• That about does it for another 
month. Note our 'first' for this 
month, a story by a previously un- 
publisihed author named Carroll J. 
Clem. Note too that we've added 
a guest editorial — this one by Les- 
ter del Rey — on the principle that 
we've been talking to you every 
month for a long time now, and it's 
about time we moved over and gave 
someone else a shot at it. 

See you next month. — The Editor
