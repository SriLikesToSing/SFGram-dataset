^^HEN Danny Dalehouse first 
went to Sofia, he did not know it for 
the first stage in a much longer 
journey, nor that he would meet 
some of his future companions. He 
had never heard of that larger desti- 
nation, which bore the unattractive 
name of N-OA Bes-bes Geminorum 
8426, or, for that matter, of the 
people. Their names were Nan Di- 
mitrova and Captain Marge Men- 
ninger. The occasion was the Tenth 
General Assembly of the World 
Conference on Exobiology, and the 
time was not in any way bad for 
any of them. It was a springtime 
season, and for a moment there all 
the world seemed to be building 
into sweet and friendly life. 

There were three thousand people 
in the Great Hall of Culture and 
Science for the opening session, so 
many of them political that the five 
or six hundred scientists who were 
actively involved had trouble find- 
ing seats. Even the translators were 
doubled up in their booths. Hand- 
some, hoary old Carl Sagan delivered 
the opening invocation, looking like 
a spry octogenarian instead of what- 

JEM 



ever incredible age he really was. 
He was already wheeling forward to 
the rostrum as Dan Dalehouse 
squeezed into a seat at the back of 
the hall. Dalehouse had never been 
in Bulgaria before. He had been 
drawn to the sunny parks, and 
promised himself a look at the 
museum of centuries-old ikons 
under St. Stephan’s Cathedral, a 
few blocks away. But he didn’t 
want to miss Sagan, and the first 
plenary session was a tutorial on 
tactran reports. Some of the stuff he 
had never heard before. ITiat was 
probably Sagan’s work, he thought. 
Even as honorary Joint chairman, 
Sagan passed the whole program 
through his nonsense filter. What 
was left was sure to be worth hear- 
ing. Sagan spoke briefly, and 
cheeerfully, and rolled away to a 
standing ovation. 

Because the keynote speaker had 
been an American, the chairman of 
the tachyon-transmitter tutorial had 
to be from one of the other blocs. 
That was international etiquette. He 
was an Englishman, from Fred 
Hoyle’s Cambridge group. A few of 
the dignitaries from the Fuel Bloc 
stayed to hear him out of group sol- 

5 




idarity, but most of the other 
political people left as inconspicu- 
ously as they could, and Dalehouse 
was able to move up to a better seat 
on the center aisle. 

He settled himself to tolerate the 
chairman’s opening remarks, lulled 
by the scent of flowers coming 
through the opening windows — 
Bulgaria made even less use of 
air-conditioning than the United 
States. Since Food and Fuel had al- 
ready been heard from, protocol re- 
quired the next space go to People. 
So it was a Pakistani who read the 
first paper, entitled “Vital Signa- 
tures Reported from Bodies Orbiting 
Alpha Draconis, Procyon, 17-Kappa 
Indi and Kung’s Semi-Stellar Ob- 
ject.’’ 

Dalehouse had been half- 
drowsing, but as the title came 
through his earphones he sat up. “I 
never heard of some of those 
stars,’’ he remarked to his neighbor. 
“Who is this guy?’’ 

She pointed to her program and 
the nameiDr. Ahmed Dullah, Zul- 
kifar Ali Bhutto University, 
Hyderabad. As Dalehouse leaned 
over he discovered that the flower 
scent was not coming from the win- 
dows but from her, and he took a 
closer look. Blonde. A little plump, 
but with a solid, good natured, pret- 
ty face. Hard to tell the age, but 
maybe about the same as himself, 
which was mid-thirties. Since his 
divorce, Dalehouse had become 
more aware of the sexuality of 
woman colleagues and chance-met 
females in general, but also more 
wary. He smiled thanks and sank 
back to listen. 

The first part was not exciting. 
The reports on the probe to Alpha 



Draconis had already been pub- 
lished. He was not greatly interested 
to hear again about the photometric 
measurements that established the 
presence of photosynthetic “plant” 
life and a reducing atmosphere. 
There were plenty of planets like 
that around that had been scanned 
and reported by the tachyon probes 
with their cargoes of instruments — 
the whole thing no bigger than a 
grapefruit, but miraculously capable 
of leaping interstellar distances in a 
week. The Pakistani seemed intent 
on repeating every word of every 
one of the reports, not failing to 
comment on the number of other 
reducing-atmosphere pl^ets discov- 
ered, and the apparent generally low 
level of evolved life on them. The 
Procyon probe had lost its lock and 
the reports were at best ambiguous. 
Mercifully, Dullah did not dwell on 
the instrumentation. 17-Kappa Indi 
sounded better — an oxygen atmo- 
sphere, at least, although the temper- 
ature range was bad and the signa- 
tures were sketchy — but the real 
prize was at the end. 

Kung’s Semi-Stellar Object was 
not much more than a planet itself. 
As stars went it was tiny, barely big 
enough to fuse nuclei and radiate 
heat, but it had a planet that 
sounded like fun. Hot. Humid. 
Dense air, but about the right partial 
pressure of oxygen to be congenial 
for life — including the life of a 
exploring human explorative party if 
anybody cared to spend the money 
to try it out. And the signatures 
were first-rate. Carbon dioxide. 
Traces, but only traces of methane. 
Good photometry. The only parame- 
ters missing were radio wave- 
lengths: otherwise it would have 



6 



GALAXY 




sounded a lot like Miami Beach. 

The Pakistani then went on to 
explain how Kung’s Star had been 
discovered by the big fixed radio 
dish at Nagchhu Dzong, in the 
Thanglha Hills, and that it had 
come about as a direct result of the 
wisdom and example of the late 
Chairman Mao. That was not in it- 
self very interesting, except to the 
other members of the People Bloc, 
who were nodding grave concur- 
rence, but the planet seemed pretty 
strange. The translation had trouble 
keeping up with the Pakistani, and 
it wasn’t Dalehouse’s area of spe- 
cial interest anyhow, but he made 
out that the part covered in the biot- 
ic study was only a part on one 
hemipshere. Funny! Nor was he the 
only one fascinated. He looked up 
at the bank of translators, each in 
their individual glass cages, . like 
nailclippers and pocket combs be- 
hind the windows of a vending 
machine. Each booth had its draped 
scarlet curtains tied back with a 
gold sash, very Slavic and incon- 
gruous, and behind them the trans- 
lators looked like atronauts in their 
solid-state communications helmets. 
One of them was a young girl with 
a sweet, plain face, beaming for- 
ward to stare at the speaker with an 
expression of either incredulity or 
rapture. Her lips weren’t moving; 
she seemed to be too entranced to 
function. 

Dalehouse borrowed a pencil 
from the woman next to him and 
made a note in the margin of his 
program: Invstgt Kungs Star, posbl 
survey grant. It was the first time 
he had ever heard of it. 



What can be said of someone like 
Danny Dalehouse? Grammar 
school, high school, college, 
graduate school; he got his Pretty 
Heavy Diploma at twenty-six, and 
jobs were scarce. He managed to 
teach Freshman Biology for a year, 
then a year on a grant in Tbilisi, 
and better than another year of 
post-doctoral studies, so that he was 
past thirty before he caught on at 
Michigan State’s new exobiology 
department. The marriage that had 
survived a year of living on cheese 
and white wine in Soviet Georgia 
began to dissolve in East Lansing. 
He was medium height, viewed 
charitably — about one-seventy in his 
shoes — and slim. He wasn’t particu- 
larly handsome, either, ^^^at he 
was was smart. He was smart 
enough so that in three years at 
Michigan State he had made himself 
one of the Food Bloc’s two experts 
in reading the telemetry from a 
tachyon-transmitter probe and trans- 
lating it into a good guess at how 
much life the signatures rep- 
resented, and even what kinds of 
life. Then he was smart enough to 
figure out that a telemetry interpre- 
ter who got to be nation^ly known 
for his skill was going to look too 
valuable where he was to be risked 
on a manned expedition to one of 
those fascinating, remote worlds. So 
he tapered off on the interpretation 
and resharpened his skills at 
mountain-climbing, sailplaning and 
long-distance running. You never 
knew what kind of athletic quality 
you might need, if you were ever 
lucky enough to be one of the few 
score people each year who got 
tossed to another star. 

Being divorced was probably a 

7 



JEM 




plus quality. A man without much 
home life would be judged better 
able to concentrate on the job than 
someone mooning over wife and 
kids fifty light-years away. 
Dalehouse hadn’t wanted Polly to 
leave. But when she did pack up 
and go, he was quick to see that the 
divorce wasn’t all bad. 



That night in the Aperitif Bar he 
ran into the blonde again. He had 
gone to listen in on the headliner’s 
news conference, but the crowd at 
that end of the bar was pretty thick, 
and most of thenr seemed to be ac- 
tual reporters whom he didn’t feel 
justified in shoving aside. Between 
their heads and cameras he caught 
glimpses of Sagan and Iosif 
Shklovski sitting together in their 
life-support chairs at one end of the 
narrow room, having their pictures 
taken, and passing smiling com- 
ments and an oxygen mask back 
and forth to each other. They rolled 
away toward the elevators, and 
most of the crowd followed them. 
Dalehouse stoped for a drink and 
looked around the bar. 

The blonde was drinking Scotch 
with two small, dark, smiling 
men — no, he realized; she was 
drinking Scotch, but they were 
drinking orange juice. 

The men got up and said good 
night while he was looking for a 
place to sit down, and he perceived 
the opportunity. “Mind if 1 join 
you? I’m Danny Dalehouse, Michi- 
gan State.’’ 

“Marge Menninger,’’ she said, 
and she didn’t mind his joining her 



at all. She didn’t mind letting him 
buy her another Scotch, and she 
didn’t mind buying him one back, 
and she didn’t mind going out for a 
stroll under the fat Bulgarian spring 
moon, and she didn’t mind going to 
his room to open his bottle of Bul- 
garian wine; and altogether, the day 
when Danny Dalehouse first heard 
of Kung’s Star was a very success- 
ful and pleasurable day for him. 

The next day, not quite so good. 

It began well enough, in the early 
dawn. They woke in each other’s 
arms and made love again without 
changing position. It was too early 
to get anything to eat, so they 
shared the last of the bottle of wine 
as they showered and dressed. Then 
they decided to go for a walk. 

It had rained a little during the 
night. The streets were wet. But the 
air was warm and in the lovely rose 
glow of the sunrise, the Maria- 
Theresa-yellow buildings were 
warm peach and friendly. 

“The next thing I want to do,’’ 
said Dalehouse expansively, slip- 
ping an arm around Margie’s waist, 
“is take a look at Kung’s Star.” 

Marge looked at him with a dif- 
ferent kind of interest. “You’ve got 
funding for that? ’ ’ 

“Well — ’’coming down — ”no. 

No, I guess not. MSU launched 
four tactrans last year, but we’ve 
never had a grant for a manned 
probe. ” 

She butted her head against his 
shoulder. “You’re more of an 
operator than you look.” 

“What?” 

“You don’t come on real strong, 
Danny Boy, but you know what 
you’re doing every minute, don’t 
■you? Like last night. Those two 



8 



GALAXY 




Ay-rabs weren’t getting anywhere 
trying to put the make on me. Then 
you just eased right in.” 

“I’m not sure I know what we’re 
talking about. ” 

“No?” 

“No, not really.” But she didn’t 
seem about to clarify it, so he went 
back to what really interested him. 
“That planet sounds pretty great, 
Margie. Maybe even industry! Did 
you get that part? Traces of carbon 
monoxide and ozone.” 

She objected thoughtfully, 
“There were no radio signals.” 

“No. Doesn’t prove anything. 
They wouldn’t have heard any radio 
signals from Earth two hundred 
years ago, but there was a civiliza- 
tion there.” 

She pursed her lips but didn’t an- 
swer. It occurred to him that some- 
thing was troubling her, perhaps 



some female thing of the sort that 
he had never considered himself 
very good at comprehending. He 
looked around for something to 
cheer her up and said, “Hey, look 
at those fellows. ” 

They were strolling past the Di- 
mitrov Mausoleum. In spite of the 
hours, in spite of the fact that there 
was no other human being in sight, 
the two honor guards stood ab- 
solutely immobile in their antic 
musical-comedy uniforms, not even 
the tips of the long curled feathers 
on their helmets quivering. 

Margie glanced but, whatever 
was on her mind, sightseeing was 
not part of it. “It would be at least 
a two-year hitch.” She said. 
“Would you really want to go?” 

“I, uh, I think I’d miss you, 
Margie,” he said, misinterpreting 
her point.

Impatiently, “Ah, no crap. If you 
had the funding, would you go?” 
“Try me.” 

“That Pak was so flaming 
pleased with himself. He’s probably 
got it all lined up with Heir-of-Mao 
for the Peeps to send a manned 
probe there already. ” 

“Well, that’s fine with me, too. I 
don’t want to go for political 
reasons. I don’t care what country 
meets the first civilized aliens; I just 
want to be there.” 

“I care,” she said. She slipped 
free of him to light a cigarette. 

Dalehouse stopped and watched 
her cup her hands around the lighter 
to shield it from the gentle morning 
breeze. They had had a good deal to 
drink and not very much sleep. He 
could feel a certain interior frailty 
from the consequences, but Marge 
Menninger seemed unaffected. This 
was the first time he had gone to 
bed with a girl without exchange of 
several chapters of autobiography. 
He didn’t know her at all in his 
mind, only through his senses. 

The other thing in Dalehouse ’s 
thoughts was that in the 10AM ses- 
sion he had a paper to give — 
“Preliminary Studies toward a First 
Contact with Subtechnological 
Sentients” — and he wanted enough 
time to add some comments about 
the planet of Kung’s Star. 

He sneaked a glance at his watch: 
7:30, plenty of time. The city was 
still quiet. Somewhere out of sight 
he could hear the first tram of the 
morning. Far down the street they 
were walking on he could see two 
city gendarmes, strolling hand in 
hand, their batons swinging from 
the outside hands of each. Nothing 
else seemed to be happening in 



Sofia. It made him think of his own 
home in East Lansing at that same 
promising time of the day and year, 
when the University was running at 
half-speed for the summer sessions 
and on decent mornings Dalehouse 
walked or hiked to his office to 
enjoy the peace. And, of course, to 
get out of his empty house. 

To be sure, he reminded himself, 
Sofia was not in the least like East 
Lansing; flat and urban, where his 
home was hilly and carpeted with 
solid quarter-acre split-levels. And 
Marge Menninger was not in the 
least like absent Polly, who had 
been dark, tiny, quick, and easily 
bored. What exactly was Marge 
Menninger like? Dalehouse had not 
quite made up his mind. She 
seemed to be different people. Yes- 
terday in the Great Hall of Culture 
and Science she had been another 
academic colleague, last night 
exactly what every all-American 
boy would like to find in his bed. 
But who was she this morning? They 
weren’t strolling with their arms 
around each other’s waists any 
more. Marge was a meter away and 
a little ahead of him, moving 
briskly, smoking with intensity and 
staring straight ahead. 

She seemed to reach a decision, 
and glanced at him. “Michigan 
State University, Institute of Extra- 
Solar Biology. Daniel Dalehouse, 
B.A., M.Sc., Ph.D. I guess I didn’t 
tell you that I saw a preprint of 
your paper before I left 
Washington.” 

“You did?” He was startled, not 
only at the statement but at her 
knowing his credits. 

“Interesting paper, makes me 
think you’re serious about wanting 



10 



GALAXY 




to go. Danny boy, I might be able 
to help you.” 

“Help me how?” 

“With money, dear man. That’s 
all I’ve got to give. But I think 1 can 
give some to you. In case you 
didn’t notice my name tag when you 
were taking my clothes off, that’s 
what I do for a living. I’m with 
SERDCOM.” 

“Praise Com from whom all 
blessings flow,” Danny said fer- 
vently; it was the annual grants 
from the Space Exploration, Re- 
search and Development Commis- 
sion that kept Dalehouse’s Institute 
green. “How come I’ve never seen 
you when I go to Washington with 
my begging bowl?” 

“I’ve only been there since Feb- 
ruary. I’m Vice-Secretary for New 
Projects. Job didn’t exist till the 
first of the year, and 1 wangled it. 
Before then I was teaching the stuff 
at my alma mater. .among other 
subjects; we didn’t have much of an 
extra-solar department. It’s a small 
school, and it fell on hard times 
even while I was still an under- 
graduate. Well? What about it?” 
“About what?” 

“Were you dreaming? Or do you 
want a grant for a manned trip to 
Kung’s Star?” 

“I do! Christ, yes 1 do, I do.” 
She took his hand in one of hers, 
patted it with the other. “You may 
regard it as settled. Hello, what’s 
this?” 

“But — ” 

“I said settled.” She was no 
longer looking at him, something 
had caught her attention. They had 
come to a large park, and off to 
their right was a mall leading up to 
a monument. Flanking the entrance 



to the mall were two heroic groups 
of bronze statuary. 

Dalehouse followed her toward 
them, feeling dazed as well as hung 
over; it had not sunk in yet. “1 
suppose I ought to submit a pro- 
posal,” he said tentatively. 

“You bet. Send me a draft first 
before you put it through chan- 
nels.” She was examining the 
bronzes. “Will you look at this 
stuff I ’ ’ 

Dalehouse inspected them without 
interest. “It’s a war memorial,” he 
said. “Soldiers and peasants.” 

“Sure, but it isn’t that old. 
That’s a tommy-gun that soldier is 
holding. .and there’s one on a 
motor bike. And, look, some of the 
soldiers are women.” 

She bent down and inspected the 
Cyrillic lettering without com- 
prehension. “Damn. Don’t know 
what it says. But it’s the workers 
and peasants welcoming liberators, 
right? It has to be the last o( the 
Big Ones — World War Two. Let’s 
see, this is Bulgaria, so that must 
be the Red Army chasing the Ger- 
mans out and all the Bulgarians 
bringing them flowers and hearty 
fraternal-solidarity handshakes and 
glasses of clear spring water. Wow. 
Jesus, Danny, both my grandfathers 
fought in this war, and one grand- 
mother. Two on one side, one on 
the other. ’ ’ 

Dalehouse looked at her with 
amusement and fondness, if not full 
comprehension; it was strange to 
find anyone who took such an inter- 
est in actual footslogging fighting 
these days, when everyone knew 
that war was simply priced out of 
the market for any nation that 
wanted to survive. “What about 



JEM 



11 




your other grandmother? Some kind 
of slacker?” 

She looked up at him for a mo- 
ment. “She died in the. bombings,” 
she said. “Hey, this is fun.” 

The bronzes were certainly mili- 
tary enough for'any war fan. Every 
figure was expressing courage, joy 
and resolution in maximum 
socialist-realist style. They had been 
sculptured to fit in four-square ob- 
long blocks, with all the figures fit- 
ted into each other to conform; they 
looked a lot like a box of frozen 
sardines writhing around each other. 
Margie’s interest in the sculpture 
was itself attracting interest, 
Dalehouse saw; the gendarmes had 
reached the end of their beat and 
were passing nearby on the return, 
watching benignly. 

“What’s so much fun about sol- 
diers?” he asked. 

“They’re my trade, dear Dan. 
Didn’t you know? Marjorie Maude 
Menninger, Captain, USA late of 
West Point, or late of the practically 
late West Point, as I sometimes say. 
You should see me in uniform.” 
She lighted another cigarette, and 
when she passed it to him for a 
drag he realized they had not been 
tobacco. 

She held the smoke, then exhaled 
it in a long plume. “Ah, those 
were the days,” she said dreamily, 
gazing at the bronzes. “Look at that 
grunt holding the baby up in the air. 
Know what he’s saying to the other 
soldier? ‘Go ahead, Ivan, I’ll hold 
the kid while you rape her mommy. 
Then you hold the kid and it’s my 
turn.’ ” 

Dalehouse laughed. Encouraged, 
Margie went on; “And that young 



boy is saying, ‘Hey, glorious Red 
Army soldier, you like my sister? 
Chocolate? Russki cigaretti?’ And the 
WAC that’s taking the flowers from 
the woman, she’s saying, ‘So Com- 
rade! Stealing agricultural produce 
from the people’s parks! Make no 
mistake about it, it’s a long time in 
the camps for you!’ ’Course, by the 
time the Soviets got here the Ger- 
mans were finished anyhow, but — ” 

“Margie,” he said. 

“ — still it must have been pretty 
exciting — ” 

“Hey, Margie! Let’s move on,” 
he said uneasily. He had suddenly 
realized that the gendarmes were no 
longer smiling, and remembered, a 
little late, that all the municipal 
police had been given language les- 
sons for the conference. 

II 

What one could say about Ana 
Dimitrova was hardly necessary to 
spell out, because it was apparent 
on first meeting: she was a sweet, 
cheerful girl with a capacity for 
love. Sometimes she had the grind- 
ing tension headaches that were typ- 
ical of the people whose corpus 
callosum had been cut through, and 
then she was disoriented, irritable, 
sometimes almost sick w'ith pain. 
But she excused herself and bore 
them in private whenever she could. 

An hour earlier she woke up, as 
she had planned, and stole into the 
kitchen to make tea with her own 
hands. No powdered trash for 
Ahmed! When she brought it in to 
him he opened these heartbreaking 
long lashes and smiled at her, crin- 
kling the dark brown eyes. “You are 
too good to me, Nah,” he said in 



12 



GALAXY 




Urdu. She set the cup down beside 
him and bent to touch his cheek 
with hers. Ahmed did not believe in 
kissing, except under circumstances 
which, while she found them enjoy- 
able and desirable, were not in- 
cluded in her present plans. 

“Let’s get dressed quickly,” she 
proposed. “I want to show you my 
good monster.” 

“Monster?” 

“You’ll see.” She escaped his 
grasp and retreated to the shower, 
where she let the hot water beat on 
her temples for a long time. The 
solidstate helmets often brought on 
the headaches, and she did not want 
one today. 

Later, while she was drying her 
long brown hair, Ahmed came in si- 
lently and ran his fingers along the 
narrow scar in her scalp. “Dear 
Nah,” he said, “so much trouble to 
go to to learn Urdu. I learned it for 
nothing.” 

She leaned against him for a 
moment, then wrapped the towel 
around herself and scolded, gently, 
“There is no time for this if we are 
going to see my monster in the 
dawn light. Also it was not to learn 
languages that 1 had my brain split. 
It was only to be able to translate 
them better. ” 

“We would not do such a thing 
in Pakistan,” he said, but she knew 
he was only being dear. 

Outside the bathroom door, lis- 
tening to him squawk and grumble 
as the cold water hit him, Nah 
thought seriously about Ahned. She 
was a practical person. She was by 
no means unwilling to sacrifice a 
material good for a principle or a 
feeling, but she preferred to know 
clearly what the stakes were. For 



her love game with Ahmed, the 
stakes were pretty high. Bulgaria, 
like the Soviet Union, was among 
the most People-tolerant of the 
food-exporting nations, but the lines 
of international politics were still 
clear. They would be able to see 
each other only seldom and with 
difficulty unless one or the other of 
them renounced citizenship. She 
knew that one would not be 
Ahmed. 

How deeply did she want to be 
involved with this dear Pakistani? 
Could she share a life in the 
crowded, slow cities of the People 
Bloc? She had seen them. They 
were charming enough. But a diet 
of mostly grain, a nearly total lack 
of personal machines, the inward- 
turning of the People Bloc 
minds — were they what she wanted? 
Congenial to visit, pleasant and 
quaint for a day or a month. .but 
the rest of her life? 

She dressed quickly without de- 
ciding the issue: one part of her 
mind was on what she was doing, 
the other on rehearsing her plans for 
that day’s work at the conference; 
nothing was left for Ahmed. She 
made the bed while he was dress- 
ing, put away the washed dishes 
and glasses and almost tugged him 
out the door. 

The sky was bright pink, but the 
sun was just appearing; there was 
time if they hurried. She led him 
down the stairs, no waiting for the 
tiny cranked elevator, and out into 
the courty^d, then quickly away 
from the university to an intersec- 
tion of two boulevards. She stopped 
and turned around. “There, see?” 

Ahmed squinted into the sunrise. 
“I see the cathedral,” he grumbled. 



JEM

“Yes, that’s it. And the mon- 
ster? ’ ’ 

“Monster? Is it in the cathe- 
dral?” 

“It is the cathedral.” 

“St. Stephan’s is a mon- 
ster? . .Oh! Yes, I think I see. Those 
windows up high they are the eyes? 
And those windows lined up under- 
neath. They are the teeth. 

“It’s smiling at us, do you see? 
And there are the ears, and the 
nose.” 

“Ahmed was not looking at the 
cathedral anymore, but at her. 
“You are such a strange girl. I 
wonder what sort of Pakistani you 
would make. ” 

Nah caught her breath. “No! It’s 
too much. Please don’t talk like 
that.” She took his arm. “Please, 
let’s just walk.” 

“I have not had any breakfast, 
Ana.” 

“There’s plenty of time.” She 
guided him trough the small park 
to the University, and down toward 
the larger one. She laughed. “Have 
you forgiven me for translating you 
so badly into Bulgarian?” 

“i would not have known how 
bad it was, if you had not told 
me.” 

“It was bad enough, Ahmed. I 
was looking at you when you were 
talking about this Kung’s Star, and 
I forgot to translate.” 

He glanced at her cautiously. 
“E)o you know,” he said, “Heir- 
of-Mao is personally interested in 
this planet. It was he who chose the 
name for the quasistellar object. He 
was there at the Observatory while 
it was discovered. I think — ’ 

“What do you think, Ahmed?” 

“I think exciting things will hap- 



pen,” he said obscurely. 

She laughed and lifted his hand 
to touch her cheek. 

“Aha,” he said, and stopped in 
the middle of the boulevard. “Lis- 
ten to me. It is not impossible, you 
know. Even if I were to be away 
for a time, after that, for you and 
me, it would not be impossible. 
“Please, dear Ahmed — ” 

“It is not impossible! I know,” 
he said bitterly, oblivious of the fact 
that they were standing in the mid- 
dle of the road, “that Pakistan is a 
poor country. We do not have food 
to export, like you and the Ameri- 
cans, and we do not have oil like 
the Middle Eastern States and the 
English. So we join with the coun- 
tries that are left. ” 

“I respect Pakistan very much.” 
“You were a child when you 
were there,” he said severely. “But 
all the same it is not impossible to 
be happy, even in the People 
Bloc.” 

A trolleybus was coming, three 
cars long and almost silent on its 
rubber-tired wheels. Nah tugged 
him out of the way, glad for the 
chance to change the subject. 

The difficulty with international 
conferences, she thought, was that 
you met political opponents and 
sometimes they did not seem like 
opponents. She had not meant this 
involvement with someone from the 
other side. She certainly did not want 
its inconvenience and pain. She 
knew what the stakes were. As a 
translator with four fully mastered 
languages and half a dozen partials, 
she had been all over the world — 
largely within the Food Bloc, to be 
sure, but even so that included 
Moscow and Kansas City and Rio 



14 



GALAXY 




and Ottawa. She had met defectors 
from the other sides. There had 
been a Welsh girl in Sydney; there 
were two or three Japanese on the 
faculty of the University, her own 
neighbors in Sofia. They always 
tried desperately to belong, but they 
were always different. 

Both the morning and Ahmed 
were too beautiful for such unhappy 
thoughts. That part of her mind 
which daydreamed and worried 
went from worry to daydream; the 
other part of her mind, the perceiv- 
ing and interpreting part, had been 
following some events across the 
boulevard, and now commanded her 
attention. 

“Look,” she said, clutching at 
an excuse to divert Ahmed’s single 
track of attention, “what is that 
going on over there?” It was on the 
Liberation Mall. The blonde woman 
she had seen at one of the recep- 
tions was having an argument with 
two militiamen. One had her by the 
arm. The other was fingering his 
stun-stick and talking severely to 
another man, a youngish professo- 
rial type, also from the conference. 

Ahmed said, uninterested, 
“Americans and Bulgarians. Let the 
fats settle their problems between 
themselves. ” 

“No, really!” Nah insisted. “I 
must see if I can help. ” 

But in the long run all that Nah 
Dimitrova succeeded in accomplish- 
ing was to get herself arrested too. 

It was the American woman’s 
fault. Even an American should 
have known better that to make 
chauvinist-filth jokes about the Red 
Army within the hearing of the 
police of the capital of the most 
Russophile of nations. If she hadn’t 



known that much, at least she 
should have known better than to 
insist on her treaty right to have the 
American Ambassador informed of 
the incident. Up to that point, the 
militiamen were only looking for a 
convenient point at which to finish 
reprimanding the culprits and stroll 
away. After that, it was a matter 
with international repercussions. 

The only good thing about it was 
that Ahmed didn’t get involved. 
Nah sent him away. He left will- 
ingly enough, even amused. The 
rest of them, the two Americans 
and Nah herself, all got taken to the 
People’s Palace of Justice. Because 
it was a Sunday morning, they had 
to sit for hours on bare wood 
benches in an interrogation room 
until a magistrate could be found. 

No one used the room to interro- 
gate them. No one would have 
minded in the least, Nah was sure, 
if they had accepted the invitation 
of the open door and slipped si- 
lently away. But she did not want 
to do that by herself. The Ameri- 
cans were not willing to take the 
chance, the woman because she ap- 
peared to think some sort of princi- 
ple was involved, the man evidently 
because the woman was involved. 
She eyed them with displeasure, 
especially the bleached blonde, at 
least five kilos too well fed, even 
for the Food Bloc. You cannot 
choose your allies, she thought. The 
man seemed to be all right. Not too 
fastidious about whom he indulged 
his sexual pranks with. Still, as the 
time passed, and the militiamen 
brought them croissants and strong 
tea, the confinement drew them to- 
gether. They chatted cheerfully 
enough, until the People’s Magis- 



JEM

trate at last arrived, gpffly refused 
to hear any talk of treaties or Ambas- 
sadors, instructed them in future to 
use the common sense God had 
given them and the good manners 
dieir mothers had no doubt taught 
them and let them go. 

By then they had completely 
missed the 10 AM session of the 
conference. Almost as bad, they had 
missed the special lunches arranged 
for the delegates. As it was a Sun- 
day morning in spring, every restau- 
rant in Sofia was booked full with 
private wedding parties and none 
of them got any lunch at all. 

That was the first time the three 
of them met. 

The second was very much later, 
and very, very far away. 

Danny Dalehouse found that a col- 
league had read his paper for him. 
So missing the morning session 
turned out not to have been an utter 
disaster, and in fact looked like 
producing a hell of a big plus. Mar- 
gie was bright enough to realize 
she’d been dumb, and ego-strong 
enough to admit it. However serious 
or otherwise Margie had been about 
the grant strolling down the 
boulevard, full of wine, pot and 
roses, now she was rueful enough 
to remember her promise. 

All the way home from the con- 
ference in the clamjet, Dalehouse sat 
with his notebook on his knee, 
drawing up a proposal, until it was 
time to go to his bunk. By dawn 
they were over white-and-brown 
Labrador, the jet moving more 
slowly through the cold night air. 
Dalehouse ate his breakfast alone, 
except for a sleepy TWA stewardess 
to scramble his eggs and pour his 
coffee, looking out at the clouds as 



the clamjet roller-coasted in and out 
of them, and wondering what the 
planet of Kung’s Star would be like. 

Ill 

The day after Marge Menninger 
got back to her Washington office, 
she received Dalehouse ’s prelimi- 
nary written proposal. But she had 
already begun the process of getting 
it granted. 

She had left the conference early 
to catch a ride on a NASA hydrojet, 
a rough and expensive ride but a 
fast one, back to her apartment in 
Houston. From there she had called 
the Deputy Undersecretary of State 
for Cultural Affairs. It was after 
office hours, but she got through 
with no trouble. Marge was on easy 
terms with the Deputy Undersecre- 
tary. She was his daughter. Once 
she had told him she’d had a pleas- 
ant trip she came right to the point; 
“Pappa, 1 need a grant for a 
manned interstellar flight.” 

There was a short silence. Then 
he said, “Why?” 

Marge scratched under her navel, 
thinking of all the reasons she could 
have given. For the advancement of 
human knowledge? For the potential 
economic benefit of the United 
States and rest of the food- 
producing world? For the sake of 
her promise to Danny Dalehouse? 
All of these were reasons which 
were important to her; but to her 
father she gave only the one major 
reason that prevailed: “Because if 
we don’t do it the son-of-a-bitching 
Paks will.” 

“By themselves?” Even three 
thousand kilometers away, she 
heard the skepticism.

GALAXY 




“The Chinese will put up the 
hard stuff. They’re in it, too.” 

“You know what it’s going to 
cost.” It wasn’t a question; they 
both knew the answer. Even a 
tachtran message capsule cost a 
couple millions dollars to transport 
from one star system to another, 
and they weighed only a few kilos. 
What she had in mind was at least 
ten people with all their gear: she 
was asking for billions of dollars. 

“A lot,” she said, “but it’s 
worth it. ’’Her father chuckled ad- 
miringly. “You’ve always been the 
most expensive of my children, 
Margie. How are you going to get it 
past the joint committee?” 

“I think I can. Let me worry 
about that, poppa.” 

“Urn. Well, I’ll help from this 
end. What do you want from me 
right now?” 

Marge hesitated. It was an open 
phone connection, and so she chose 
her words carefully. “I asked that 
Pak for a copy of his full report. Of 
course. I’m a little handicapped 
until I get my hands on it.” 

“Of course,” her father agreed. 
“Anything else?” 

“There’s not much 1 can do until 
I see the full report.” 

“1 understand. Well. What else is 
new? How did you like our brave 
Bugarian allies?” 

She laughed. “1 guess you know. 
1 got arrested.” 

“I only wonder it doesn’t happen 
more often. Youre a terrible person, 
love. You didn’t get it from my side 
of the family.” 

“I’ll tell Mom you said that,” 
she promised, and hung up; and so 
by the time she was back in 
Washington and Dalehouse’s pro- 



posal was on her desk she had al- 
ready received, by a different route, 
a microfilmed copy of the Pakis- 
tani’s entire report, already trans- 
lated for her. She read them both 
over diligently, making notes. Then 
she pushed them away and leaned 
back in her chair thoughtfully. 

The son-of-a-bitching Pak had 
held back a lot. In his private re- 
port, three times as thick as the one 
he had read from in Sofia there was 
an inventory of major life forms. 
He hadn’t mentioned that at all in 
Sofia. At least three species seemed 
to possess some sort of social or- 
ganization; a kind of arthropod; a 
tunneling species, warm-blooded 
and soft-skinned; and an avian 
species — no, not avian, she cor- 
rected herself. They spent most of 
their time in the air, but without hav- 
ing developed wings. They were 
balloonists, not birds. Three social 
species! At least one of them might 
well be intelligent enough to be 
civilized. 

That brought her back to Danny 
Dalehouse, his paper on first con- 
tact with sentient life forms at the 
sub-technological level, and his 
draft proposal. She looked again 
at the bottom line of the proposal 
and grinned. 

Young Danny didn’t have any 
hangups about asking for what he 
wanted. The bottom line was seven- 
teen billion dollars. 

Seventeen billion dollars, she re- 
flected, was about the assessed val- 
uation of Manhattan Island. .the 
GNP of any of twenty-five or thirty 
of the world’s nations. .about two 
months’ worth of the United States 
fuel deficit in the balance of pay- 
ments. It was a lot of money.

She put the papers and her notes 
in a bright red folder stamped MOST 
SECRET and locked them away. 
Then she began to get Danny 
Dalehouse what he wanted. 

There is a Jot to be said about 
Marge Menninger, and the most 
important thing is that she always 
knew what she wanted. She wanted 
a lot, and a lot of different things. 
Her motivations were clearly and 
hierarchically marked in her mind. 
The third or fourth thing down from 
the top was likely to be achieved. 
The second was a near certainty. 
But the one on top was ironbound 
and foolproof. 

A week later she had Dalehouse ’s 
final proposal and an appointment 
to testify before the House-Senate 
Joint Committee on Space De- 
velopment. She used the week to 
good purpose, first to tell Dalehouse 
(on the phone, and spelled out by 
facsimile immediately afterward) 
how to change his proposal to max- 
imize its chances of approval, then 
to fill in the quite few gaps in her 
knowledge of what was required. 

To throw a transmitter capsule or 
a shipload of human beings from 
one star to another you first have to 
put them in orbit. 

Tachyon transportation itself is a 
model of technological elegance. 
Once you have elevated your cap- 
sule to its proper charge state it be- 
comes obedient to tachyonic laws. 
It moves easily at faster-than-light 
speeds, covering interstellar dis- 
tances to any point in the Galaxy in 
a matter of days. It uses surpris- 
ingly little energy in the process. 
The paradox of the tachyon is that it 
requires more energy to go slow 
than to go fast. 



Getting the capsule to the charge 
state is the hardest part. For that 
you need a rather bulky launch plat- 
form. The platform is expensive. 
More than that, it is heavy. 

Getting the platform into orbit is 
not elegant at all. It is brute force. 
A hundred kilograms of fuel have to 
bum for every gram launched in the 
tachyon state. Fuel is fuel. You can 
bum oil, or you can bum something 
you make by using oil to make it; 
say, liquid hydrogen and liquid 
oxygen. Either way, in excess of 
half a million metric tons of oil had 
to bum to get ten people and 
minimum equipment on their way to 
Kung’s Star. 

Half a million metric tons! 

It wasn’t just the dollar value. It 
was four supertankers full of fuel, 
all of which had to come from one 
of the fuel-exporting nations, which 
were showing signs of throwing 
their weight around again. 

The Quip-Three interbloc con- 
ferences on Quotas for imports and 
Prices were going badly for the 
food-exporting countries. If Marge 
didn’t get the expedition well be- 
gun, with the necessary fuel tucked 
away in the big tank farms at Gal- 
veston or Bayonne, the increasing 
fuel prices would drive the costs 
well past even Danny Dalehouse ’s 
figures. 

When all the figures were safely 
transferred from paper to the inside 
of her head. Marge locked her desk 
in the Washington office. She 
headed for Hearing Room 201 in 
the old Rayburn Office Building, 
with the knowledge that her work 
was cut out for her. 

The obstacles might have de- 
terred another person. Marge did

plined mind dissected the im- 
mediate problem into its compo-

attention on the attack for each. The

The Minority Leader was her

The Chairman was ambitious to 
be President. He would be likely to 
make waves whenever he saw a 
chance for publicity. The way to 
deal with him was to keep a low 
profile, and to give him as little op- 
portunity to take a campaign posi- 
tion as possible. After she was

swom in and read her prepared 
statement, he was the first to ques- 
tion lier. 



The Chaij-man: Well, madam. 
I’m sure your motives are of the 
worthiest, but do you know how 
hard we’re working here on the 
Hill to keep the deficit down? 
Captain Menninger: I certainly 
do, Mr. Senator. 

The Chairman: And yet you ex- 
pect us to give you God knows 
how many billion dollars for this 
project? 

That was promising! He hadn’t 
said “this harebrained project’’ or 
“this preposterous extravagance.” 

Captain Menninger: I don’t “ex- 
pect” it. Senator. I hope for it. I 
hope the Committee will approve 
the proposal, because in my 
judgment it is an investment that 
will be returned many-fold, for 
years and years to come. 

The Chairman: We can’t sp>end 
the taxpayer’s money on hopes. 
Captain Menninger: I know that 
and appreciate it. It isn’t hope 
that I’m asking you to share. It’s 
judgment. Not only mine, but 
the collective judgment of the 
best-informed experts in this 
area. 

The Chairman: Um. Well, there 
are many worthy claims based on 
very sound judgment. We can’t 
grant all of them. 

Captain Menninger: Of course. 
Senator. I wouldn’t be here if I 
weren’t confident of your fair- 
ness and competence. 



The Chairman: Well, do any of 
my distinguished colleagues have 
questions for this witness? 

They did, but they were mostly 
perfunctory. The important people, 
like Senator Lenz and the Minority 
Leader, held back for another occa- 
sion; the minor members were prin- 
cipally concerned with getting their 
own positions on record. 

The Chief Counsel was a trickier 
problem. He was smart. He was 
also wholly dedicated to making his 
bosses look good by keeping the 
Joint Committee out of trouble. 
Margie’s hope was to make saying 
yes look less troublesome than say- 
ing no. 

Mr.Gianpaolo: You spoke of re- 
turns on an investment. Do you 
mean actual cash, or some 
abstract kind of knowledge or 
virtue? 

Captain Menninger: Oh, both, 
Mr. Gianpaolo. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: Really, Ms. 

Menninger? Dollar returns? 
Captain Menninger: Based on 
prior experience and what is al- 
ready known about this planet, 
yes. Definitely. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: Can you give us 
an idea of what these dollar re- 
turns will be? 

Captain Menninger: In broad 

terms, yes, Mr. Gianpaolo. The 
tachtran reports indicate valuable 
raw materials and the presence of 
intelligent life — at least, a near 
certainty of the former, and 
strong possibility of the latter. Of 
course, these are only instrument 
reports.

Mr. Gianpaolo: Which, as I un- 
derstand, are subject to conflict- 
ing interpretations. 

Captain Menninger: Exactly, 

Mr. Gianpaolo, and that is why 
it is necessary to send a manned 
expedition out. The whole reason 
for the expedition is to find out 
what we can’t find out in any 
other way. If we knew what it 
would find, we wouldn't have to 
send it. But there is a different 
kind of return that I think is even 
more important. I think of it as 
“leadership.” 

Mr. Gianpaolo: Leadership? 

Captain Menninger: The whole 
free world of food-exporting na- 
tions looks to us for that leader- 
ship, Mr. Gianpaolo. I don’t be- 
lieve any of us wants to fail 
them. 

This opportunity that comes 
only once in a lifetime. I am 
here because I cannot in all con- 
science take the responsibility for 
losing it. It is in the final 
analysis, this Committee’s bur- 
den to carry. 

Since nothing would be decided in 
open session. Marge was confident 
there would be time to make the 
members understand that the “bur- 
den” could best be unloaded by 
voting her the money. 

If Marge Menninger had had her 
druthers, the testifying would have 
stopped there. But Gianpaolo was 
orchestrating the event. He was too 
wise to end on the note she pre- 
ferred. He blunted her dramatic im- 
pact by dragging out from her a long 
series of technical data — “Yes, Mr. 
Gianpaolo, I understand that the 
planet’s surface gravity is point 



seven six that of Earth, and its at- 
mospheric pressure about thirty per 
cent higher. But the oxygen level is 
about the same.” He read her 
quotes about the “semi-greenhouse 
effect” and asked her what was 
meant by someone’s remarks about 
“the inexhaustible reserve of out- 
gassing from the cold side, as inter- 
ior heat boils out volatiles.” He got 
her, and himself, into a long com- 
plication about whether the designa- 
tion of the star they were talking 
about was really Bes-bes 
Geminorum 8326 or Bes-bes 
Geminorum 8426 according to the 
New OAO General Catalogue — 
apparently both were given, because 
some typist made a mistake — until 
the chairman got restive. Then, 
satisfied that the audience was more 
than half asleep, he called for a 
ten-minute recess and returned to 
the attack. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: Captain Men- 
ninger, I’m sure you know what 
it cost to launch a tachyon- 
transmitted space vessel. 

First — 

Capt. Menninger: Yes, sir, I be- 
lieve I do. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: First there is the 
immense expense of the launch- 
ing vehicle itself. The costs for 
that alone, I believe, are in the 
neighborhood of six billion dol- 
lars. 

Capt. Menninger: Yes, sir. But, 
as the Vice President announced 
in his message to the Tenth Gen- 
eral Assembly of the World Con- 
ference on Exobiology, we al- 
ready have such a launch vehi- 
cle. It can be used for a large 
number of missions.

Mr. Gianpaolo: But, as the Vice 
President aJso announced, the 
time of that vehicle is fully 
booked. Prelaunch aiming time is 
as much as thirty days. 

Capt. Menninger: Yes, sir. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: But your 

schedule calls for a launch to 
this — what is the name of it? 
Capt. Menninger: It has been re- 
ferred to as “Son of Kung,” sir, 
but that name is not official. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: I hope not. You 
want a launch every ten days? 
Capt. Menninger: Yes, sir. Es- 
sential backup. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: Which means 
cancelling the mining survey 
mission to Procyon IV. I am sure 
you know that this planet has 
been identified as having a very 
dense core, with therefore a good 
{K)tential for supplies of uranium 
and other fissiles for our power 
plants. 

The British had sent that probe 
out. Meticulously they had an- 
nounced that under existing interna- 
tional agreements they were making 
the telemetry public. That was all 
public knowledge. Gianpaolo was 
just getting it on the record. 

Capt. Menninger: Yes, sir. Of 
course, that works out as a very 
marginal operation, considering 
the investment necessary to mine 
and refine uranium, and to ship 
it to us back here. The Bes-bes 
Geminorum planet has much 
more potential — as I have al- 
ready testified. 

Mr. Gianpaolo: Yes, Captain 
Menninger, you have made us 
aware of your opinions. 



And that was all hogwash. What 
the British had not announced, but 
what both Marge and Gianpaolo 
knew from previous briefing, was 
that British scintillation counters 
had found no ionizing radiation to 
speak of in Procyon Four’s rather 
unpleasant atmosphere. Uranium 
there might be, but if so it was 
thousands of meters deep. Marge 
was getting on the record too, al- 
though this particular record was 
private. 

By the time she was through tes- 
tifying she was satisfied that things 
were moving in the right direction. 

Remained the problem of Senator 
Lenz. He had far more muscle in 
the Committee, and in the Senate 
generally, than anyone else. Even 
the Chairman. He had to be dealt 
with individually and privately, and 
Marge had plans for that. 

She booked her return to Houston 
the long way around, by way of 
Denver. Her father drove her to 
Dulles Airport in his own car. Well, 
actually it wasn’t his own. It be- 
longed to a government agency. So 
did Godfrey Menninger, when you 
came right down to it. The car was 
both a perquisite of rank and an in- 
dispensable necessity in what he did 
for the agency; twice a day, other 
employees of the agency went over 
it with electronic sniffers and radio 
probes to make sure it had been 
neither bombed nor bugged. 

God Menninger told his daughter, 
“You did pretty well at the hear- 
ing.” 

“Thanks, poppa. And thanks for 
that Pak’s report.” 

“Had what you wanted in it?” 

“Yep. Will you talk to the 
Minority Leader for me?” 



22 



GALAXY 




“Already have, honey.” 

“And?” 

“Oh, he’s all right. If you get 
past Gus Lenz, I think you’ve got 
the committee taken care of. He 
didn’t say much at the hearing.” 

“I didn’t expect him to.” 

Her father waited, but as Marge 
did not go on he did not pursue 
the question. He said, “There’s a 
follow-up on your Pakistani friend. 
He’s at some kind of a meeting at 
K’ushui, along with some pretty 
high-powered people.” 

“K’ushui? What the hell is 
K’ushui?” 

“Well,” said her father, “I kind 
of wish I could give you a better 
answer than I know. It’s a place in 
Sinkiang Privince. We haven’t had, 
uh, very full reports yet. But it’s 
not far from Lop Nor, and not too 
far from the big radio dish, and 
Hair-of-Mao’s been there five or 
six times in the past year.” 

“It sounds as though they’re 
going to move.” 

“I would say so. I plugged in 
your estimates, and the best in- 
terpretation is that Heir-of Mao’s 
starting to do what you want us to 
do.” 

“Shit!” 

“Not to worry,” said her father. 
“I told that the Minority Leader, in 
strictest confidence. And I have no 
doubt he’ll tell Gianpaolo. So it’ll 
work for you, you know.” 

“I wanted to be first!” 

“First doesn’t always pick up the 
marbles, honey. How many people 
discovered America before the En- 
glish put it in their pocket? Any- 
way, tell me what’s so interesting 
about this planet.” 

Margie looked out at the high-rise 



apartments in the Virginia suburbs, 
ziggurats climbing away from the 
south exposure with the black-on- 
black textured squares of their solar 
heating panels. “It was all in 
Ahmed Dullah’s report, poppa.” 

“I didn’t read it. ” 

“Pity. Well, there’s a little star 
with a lot of crummy little planets 
and one big one. About the size of 
the Earth. Gravity’s a little lighter. 
Air’s a little denser. It’s a lot of 
real estate, poppa. And it reeks of 
life.” 

“We’ve found life before.” 
“Mosses and jellyfish! Crystal 
Things that you can call alive if you 
want to. This is different. This is a 
biota as varied as our own, maybe. 
Maybe even a civilization. The 
planet’s interesting in another way, 
too. It doesn’t rotate, I mean rela- 
tive to its primary — like the Moon 
doesn’t rotate relative to the Earth. 
So the lit side of it has a sun in the 
sky all the time — ” 

Her father listened comfortably, 
scratching his abdomen Just below 
the navel, while his daughter went 
on about the planet. When she 
paused for breath, he said “Wait a 
minute, honey.” He leaned forward 
to turn on the radio; even in a 
routinely debugged car God Men- 
ninger didn’t take chances. Over the 
twang of synthetic guitars he said, 
“There’s something else you ought 
to know. The fuel countries are 
talking among themselves about a 
sixty per cent price rise. ” 

“Jesus, poppa! I’ll never drink 
another shot of Scotch!” 

“No, it’s not the British this 
time. It’s the Chinese, funnily 
enough. ” 

“But they’re people-exporters!” 

23 



JEM 




“They’re anything-they-like ex- 
porters,” her father corrected. “The 
only reason they’re in the People 
Bloc is that they can swing more 
weight there. Heir-of-Mao plays his 
own game. This time he slipped the 
word to the Greasies that China was 
going to raise^its own prices unilat- 
erally, whatever the bloc votes to 
do. So that was all the hard-liners 
in Caracas and Edinburgh needed. 
The Saudis were for it, of course. 
They want to stretch out what oil 
they’ve got left. And the Indone- 
sians and the rest of the little ones 
just have to go along with the big 
boys.” He paused, thoughtfully. 
“So your coming along with a chit 
for half a million tons of oil gets a 
little complicated right now.” 

“I see that, poppa. What are we 
going to do? I don’t mean about my 
project, I mean the country.” 

“What we are not going to do,” 
he said grimly, “is raise grain prices. 
We can’t. Heir-of-Mao ’s joker is 
that the price rise is for export sales 
only. He considers any sales inside 
the People Bloc as domestic. So 
he’s selling cheap to the Peeps, and 
that means they’re getting what they 
need for irrigation and fertilizer at 
bargain basement prices. If we raise 
the price we’ll make it worth their 
while to stop importing in another 
three or four years. We could stand 
it in this country, maybe. But the 
Soviets, the Indochinese, the Bulga- 
rians, the Brazilians and the rest of 
the Latins — they couldn’t handle it. 
Their economics would be wrecked. 
It would break up the bloc. No 
doubt that’s what Heir-of-Mao has 
in mind. ” 

He parked the car in the Dulles 
short-term lot. Before snapping off 

24 



the radio he said, “It won’t happen 
for a couple of months, I think. So 
you want to get your project on the 
ways as fast as you can.” 

Marge slid out into the damp, hot 
Virginia evening air. The humped 
backs of boarding clamjets loomed 
over the parking lot hedge. They 
could hear the noise of two of them 
warming up, and the gentler rush of 
another taking off. 

Marge followed her father as he 
picked up her bag and started to- 
ward the terminal. “Poppa,” she 
said, “can I tell the senator about, 
uh, that?” 

“Christ, no! Not that he doesn’t 
probably know it already. But you 
aren’t supposed to know.” 

Surprisingly, she laughed. “Well, 
I was going to handle it a different 
way anyway. Hey, hold it, poppa. 
I’m not taking the Houston flight.” 

“You’re not?” 

“Uh-uh. I’m going home by a 
different route.” 

Menninger kissed his daughter 
good-by at the check-in counter for 
the Denver clamjet. He watched her 
disappear into the gate tunnel with 
mingled admiration and rue. He had 
been thinking about asking just how 
she proposed to handle Senator 
Lenz, but he didn’t have to. This 
was the flight Lenz would be on. 

Because it was a night flight, the 
jet sat there for twenty minutes of 
preheating before it could take off. 
The passengers had to be aboard, 
and the stews scurried up and down 
with ear-stoppers and sympathy. 
The best heat source there is is a jet 
turbine. The engines that would 
thrust the plane through the air in 
actual flight were now rotated in- 
ward, the shell-shaped baffles 



GALAXY 




diverting the blast to pour countless 
thousands of BTU’s into the clam- 
shaped lifting section. 

Marge took advantage of the time 
to scrub her face, brush her hair, and 
change her makeup. She had seen 
the senator come aboard. She de- 
bated changing from her uniform 
into something more female and de- 
cided against it. Wasn’t necessary. 
Wasn’t advisable: it might look cal- 
culating, and Marge calculated care- 
fully ways to avoid looking calculat- 
ing. 

The full-energy roar of the warm- 
up jets stopped, and everyone belt- 
ed in for takeoff. That was a gen- 
tler sound. The clamjet bounced a 
few times and soared steeply up. 

As soon as they were at cruising 
altitude Marge left her cubicle and 
ordered a drink in the forward 
first-class lounge. In a couple of 
minutes Senator Lenz was standing 
over her, smiling. 

Adrian Lenz had two terms and 
two days seniority in the Senate; a 
friendly governor had appointed him 
to fill a forty-eight hour vacancy, 
just for the s^e of the extra rank it 
would give him over other senators 
elected the same year. Even so, he 
was not much over forty. He looked 
younger than that. He had been di- 
vorced twice. The Colorado voters 
laughed about their swinging 
senator’s bad luck, but re-elected 
him without much fuss. He could 
have been chairman of his own 
committee. He had chosen instead 
to serve on committees that were of 
more interest — and more visibility: 
one of these days “Gus” Lenz was 

f oing to be the President of the 
Jnited States, and everyone knew 
it. “Margie,” he said, “1 knew this 



was going to be a nice flight; until 
now I didn’t know why.” 

Margie patted the seat beside her. 
“You going to give me my seven- 
teen billion?” she asked. 

Lenz laughed. “You don’t waste 
time, Margie.” 

“I don’t have time to waste. The 
Peeps are going to go there if we 
don’t. They’re probably going to go 
anyhow. It’s a race.” 

He frowned and nodded toward 
the stewardess: slight, dark; she 
wore her United Air Lines uniform 
like a sari. When the drinks were 
served he said, “I listened to your 
testimony, Margie. It sounded 
good. I don’t know if it sounded 
seventeen billion dollars’ worth of 
good. ” 

“There was some material in the 
supplementary statement you might 
not have had a chance to read. Did 
you notice the part about the planet 
having its own sun?” 

“I’m not sure.” 

“It’s small, but not very far 
away. The thing mostly radiates in 
the lower wavelengths. There’s not 
too much visible light. But a hell of 
a lot of heat. And the planet doesn’t 
turn in relation to it, so it’s always 
hanging there.” 

“So?” 

“So energy. Senator. Solar 
power! Economical.” 

“I don’t understand exactly what 
you’re saying. You mean this sub- 
stellar thing is hotter than our sun?” 
“No, it’s not nearly as hot. But 
it’s a lot closer, so that’s all right. 
The important thing is it doesn’t 
move. What’s the big problem with 
solar power here? The sun. It 
doesn’t stay put. It wanders around, 
all over the sky, and half the time 

25 



JEM 




it’s not in the sky at all because it’s 
night here and so the sun’s on the 
other side of the Earth. I mean: 
look at our ship here. We had to 
preheat for nearly half an hour to 
get the gas light enough to lift, be- 
cause it’s after dark. On the side of 
the planet' that faces its sun — the 
only side that interests me, Gus — it’s 
never dark. ” 

Lenz nodded and sipped his 
drink, waiting for more. 

“It’s never dark. It’s never 
winter. The sun stays put, so you 
don’t have to make your Fresnel 
lenses movable. And almost as im- 
portant, the weather isn’t a prob- 
lem. You know what the score is on 
our own solar-power installations. 

I Not counting clamjets in the day- 
time — because they’re up over the 
clouds a lot of the time — we lose as 
much as twenty-five per cent work- 
ing time because the clouds cut out 
the sunlight.” 

Lenz looked puzzled. “This 
planet doesn’t have any clouds?” 

“Oh, sure. But they don’t matter. 
The radiation is almost all heat, and 
it punches right through the clouds! 
Figure it out. Here we lose half the 
solar-generating time to night. 
Another few per cent to dawn and 
dusk, because the sun’s so low it 
doesn’t yield much power. As much 
as sixty per cent additional for half 
the year because it’s winter. And 
another twenty-five per cent to 
cloud-cover. Flit them all together 
and we’re lucky to get ten per cent 
utilization. On this planet a cheaper 
installation can get damn near a 
hundred per cent.” 

Lenz thought about that for a 
moment. “Sounds interesting,” he 
said cautiously, and signaled for a 

26 



refill. Margie left him to sort things 
out in his own mind. Sooner or 
later it would occur to him to ask 
what good energy some hundred 
light-years away was going to do 
the voters in the State of Colorado 
on Earth. She had an answer for 
that, too, but she was content to 
wait until he asked for it. 

But when he asked a question it 
caught her by surprise. “Margie? 
What’ve you got against the Paks?” 
“Paks? Why — nothing, really.” 
“You seem to take this Ahmed’s 
competition pretty seriously.” 

“Not on a personal level, Gus. 
I’m not crazy about Paks. But I’ve 
been on friendly terms with some. I 
had a Pak orderly when I was teach- 
ing at West Point. Nice kid. Kept 
my clothes ironed and never 
bothered me when I didn’t want 
him around. ” 

“That sounds like a nice 
appliance to own,” Lenz observed. 

“Yeah, yeah. I take your point.” 
She stopped to think. “That’s not 
where it’s at, though. I’m not 
against Ahmed because he’s a Pak. 
I’m against the Paks because they’re 
the other side. I can’t help it, 
Senator. I root for my team.” 
“Which is who, Margie? Just the 
Food Bloc? Just the United States? 
Maybe just the female commis- 
sioned officers of the U.S. Army?” 
She giggled confortably. “All of 
them, in that order,” she agreed. 

“Margie,” he said seriously, 
“we’re just shooting the bull here 
over a couple of drinks. I don’i 
want to get too heavy. ” 

“Why not, Gus? Order up a 
couple more drinks and let’s get to 
it!” 

He obeyed. While they were 
GALAXY 




coming he said, “You’re a nice 
girl, Margie, but a little too 
bloody-minded. Pity you went to 
West Point. ’’ 

“Wrong, Gus. The pity is that so 
few young Americans have the 
chance now.” 

He shook his head. “I voted to 
phase down the service academics 
and cut the military budget.” 

“I know you did. Worst vote you 
ever cast.” 

“No. There was no choice. IVe 
can’t afford war, Margie. Can’t you 
understand that? Even Pakistan 
could blow us off the map! Not to 
mention the Chinese and the Turks 
and the Poles and the rest of the 
People Bloc. Not to mention the 
British, the Saudis, the Ven- 
ezuelans. We can’t afford to fight 
anybody, and nobody can afford to 
fight us. And everybody knows it. 
They’re not our enemies — ” 

“But they’re competing with us. 
Senator,” said Captain Menninger, 
suddenly sitting up straighter and 
speaking with more precision. 
“Economically. Politically. Every 
other way. Remember Klausewitz: 
war is the logical extension of poli- 
tics. I grant,” she said quickly, 
“that we can’t go that far. We 
don’t want to blow up the planet. I 
know what you’re saying. It’s 
like that famous saying of, what 
was his name, the Russian cos- 
monaut? Years and years ago. 
Sevastianov, I think: ‘When I was 
in space I saw how tiny the world 
was, and realized how important it 
was for all of us to learn to live to- 
gether on it.’ Well, sure, Gus. But 
learning to live together doesn’t 
mean that some people can’t live a 
little better than others. It’s a fact of 



life! The Fuel people keep jumping 
their prices. And the People people 
keep demanding more money for 
their export workers, or else they’ll 
keep them home, and what will we 
do for orderlies and airline steward- 
esses? And we compete back. 
Well, Gus, when I compete I com- 
pete hard. I play to win! This 
Kung’s Star planet is something I 
want to win. I think there ’re goodies 
on this planet. 1 want them for us. 
Us being defined as the Food Bloc, 
the United States, the State of 
Texas, the city of Houston and all 
the other subdivisons you named or 
want to name, including blonde 
ex-professors from West Point, if 
you like, in descending order or 
size of community. Whichever 
community you want to talk about, 
if it’s mine, 1 want it to be first, 
best, and most successful! I think 
that’s what they call patriotism. 
Senator. 1 really doubt that you 
want to knock it.” 

He looked at her thoughtfully 
over the new drinks, and raised his. 
“To you, Margie. You really are 
some kind of iron-pants.” 

She laughed. “All right,” she 
said, softening. “I’ll drink to that. 
Now what about my bill?” 

Lenz finished his drink and put it 
down. “For better or worse we’re 
part of an economic community, 
and that’s a fact of life for you, 
Captain Margie Menninger. You 
can’t sell this to me as a United 
States venture. You might as a 
cooperative deal for the Food 
Bloc.” 

“Gripes, Gus! We’d still be pay- 
ing for the whole thing!” 

“Maybe ninety per cent of it, 
yes.” 



JEM 



27 




“Then why not do it all, and take 
it all?” 

“Because,” he said patiently, “I 
won’t vote for that. So?” 

Margie was silent for a moment, 
considering her priorities. She 
shrugged. “So all right,” she said. 
“I don’t mind if we include a few 
token gooks. Maybe two or three 
Canadians. A Brazilian. Maybe 
even a Bulgarian. In fact, there was 
a Bulgarian at the convention — ” 
She stopped herself. In mid- 
sentence it had occured to her that 
in some sense she owed that Nah 
whatever-it-was-ova a sort of a fa- 
vor; but it had occured to her in the 
same instant that the Bulgarian girl 
had been excessively close to the 
very Pak she was most worried 
about. “No,” she said, “on second 
thought I’m not sure I want a Bul- 
garian. They’re too tiny a power to 
worry about, frankly. But maybe 
one or two people from the Soviets. 
If we send ten, and if at least six 
are genuine made-in- America U.S. 
citizens, I can see bringing along a 
few from the rest of the bloc.” 
“Um.” Lenz look thoughtfully at 
her for a moment, moving slightly 
in his seat to the gentle pitching of 
the clamjet as it rose and fell 
through the night sky. “Well,” he 
said, “we’ll see.” He smiled at 
her. “What shall we do with this 
night that God has given us, Mar- 
gie? It’s too late to think hard, and 
too early to go to sleep. Want to 
watch the stars for awhile? ’ ’ 

“Exactly what I want,” she said, 
finishing the last of her drink and 
standing up. They made their way 
through the nearly empty lounge to 
the forward observation section and 
leaned against the padded rail. The 



clamjet was swooping gently over 
the rolling hills of West Virginia. 
Ahead of them Venus followed a 
crescent of a moon toward the hori- 
zon. After a while Lenz put his arm 
around her. 

“Just checking,” he said, “Old 
Iron-Pants. ” 

Margie leaned against him con- 
tentedly enough. Lenz wasn’t a big 
man. He wasn’t particularly hand- 
some, either, but he was warm and 
muscular, and his arm around her 
felt good. There were worse ways 
of lobbying for votes than this, she 
reflected, as she turned her face to 
his. 

He came through. The full com- 
mittee reported the bill out, and on 
a hot Georgia afternoon two or 
three months later Margie was 
called away from her company to 
take a high-priority phone call. She 
had not bathed for three days; 
summer field maneuvers were con- 
ducted as close to real war condi- 
tions as possible. She was sweating, 
filthy with both camouflage paint 
and Georgia clay, and she knew she 
smelled pretty high. Also her com- 
pany was Just about to take a hill 
that she had personally spotted and 
attacked, so when she got to the 
phone she was in no good mood. 
“Captain Menninger, ” she snarled, 
“and this god-damn better be im- 
portant!” 

Her father’s voice laughed in her 
ear. “You tell me,” he said cheer- 
fully. “The President signed your 
bill ten minutes ago.” Marge sank 
back onto the first sergeant’s chair, 
heedless of the looks he was giving 
her as her elbows printed mud on 
his desk. “Jesus, poppa,” she said, 
‘that’s great!” She started out at the 



28 



GALAXY 




walls of the command trailer with- 
out seeing them, calculating 
whether it was more important to 
get back to taking that hill with the 
rest of the weekend soldiers or get- 
ting on the phone to start Danny 
Dalehouse in motion. “ — what?” 
She had become aware that her 
father was still talking. 

‘‘I said there was some other 
news too, not quite so good. Your 
Pak friend.” 

“What about him, poppa?” 

“That, uh, vacation he was going 
to take? He took it last week.” 

IV 

The pilot’s name was Vissarion 
Ilyich Kappelyushnikov, short and 
dark in the standard cosmonaut tra- 
dition, with a lot more Tatar in his 
family tree than his name would 
suggest. The expedition’s eco- 
engineer was also a Soviet national, 
but Cossack-tall and fair-haired; his 
name was Pete Krivitin. The nomi- 
nal commander of the expedition 
was an American, Alex Woodring. 
And they were all going at it at 
once. Alex was trying to arbitrate 
between the two Russians, helped 
by Harriet Santori, the translator. 
She wasn’t really helping, but then 
the commander wasn’t really suc- 
ceeding at arbitrating. Kap- 
pelyushnikov wanted to land and 
get it over with. Krivitin wanted 
one more look at the probe reports 
before he would certify the landing 
site. Harriet wanted them all to act 
like adults, for heaven’s sake. 
Woodring might have been able to 
sort it all out, but the difficulty was 
that until they landed Kap- 
pelyushnikov was the captain of the 



ship and Alex’s authority was only 
potential. And it had been going on 
for more than an hour. 

Danny Dalehouse swallowed back 
the desire to intervene again. He 
loosened the straps of his decelera- 
tion couch and peered out the 
porthole. There was the planet, fill- 
ing the window. From less than a 
hundred thousand kilometers, it no 
longer looked “away”; it was be- 
ginning to look “down.” So let us 
the hell get there, he thought testily. 
These people didn’t seem to realize 
they were screwing around with his 
personal expedition, that none of 
them would have been on if he 
hadn’t persuaded that blonde Army 
female to authorize it. 

A voice in his ear said, “Think 
we’ll ever get there?” 

Danny drew back. The woman 
beside him was Sparky Cerbo, as 
amiable a person as there was on 
the expedition, but after nineteen 
days of sharing less than 20 cubic 
meters of space they were all get- 
ting edgy. The on-going spat an 
arm’s-length away didn’t make it 
any better. 

“It doesn’t look like much, does 
it?” Sparky went on, determinedly 
making the effort. Dalehouse forced 
himself to respond. It wasn’t her 
fault that he was sick of the sound, 
the sight, and the smell of her, and 
besides she was right. Son of Kung 
didn’t look like a proper planet at 
all. Danny knew what planets were 
supposed to look like. Some of 
them were red and bleak, like Mars. 
More often they were white or 
mottled-white, like everything else 
from Venus through the gas giants. 
This one wasn’t even trying to look 
right.

It wasn’t so much the planet’s 
fault as Kung’s itself; as a star, it 
was simply incompetent. If Son of 
Kung had been in orbit around 
Earth’s Sol it probably would have 
looked pretty fine. It had much the 
same atmosphere as Earth, and 
close enough to the same water bal- 
ance and soil chemistry. What it 
didn’t have was decently colored 
light from its primary. Kung glow- 
ered. It was dull red, not much 
brighter than Earth’s moon during a 
total lunar eclipse. The only light 
that fell on Son of Kung was 
bloody red, and what it looked like 
from their orbit around it was an 
open wound. 

It would have helped some if it 
had had a real terminator, but 
Kung’s light was so dim that there 
was no clear division between 
“daylight” and “night” sides, only 
a blurry transition from dark to dark- 
est. Krivitin had assured them that 
once landed and their eyes dark- 
adjusted, they would be able to see 
reasonably well. But from space 
that seemed doubtful. And for this, 
thought Danny, I gave up a per- 
fectly good Job at Michigan State. 

The Russian-language yelling 
peaked to a climax and abruptly 
stopped. Krivitin, smiling as com- 
posedly as though the screaming 
match had been no more than a 
friendly chat about the weather, 
pulled himself around the lashed- 
down and nested machinery in the 
center of the main cubicle and 
peered in at them. “Sara, dear,” he 
said in his perfect English, “you’re 
wanted up front. You better come 
too, Daniel.” 

“We’re going to land?” Sparky 
demanded. 



“Most certainly not! Cappy has 
finally understood the necessity for 
another orbit. ” 

“Hell,” said Sparky, even her in- 
domitable desire to please crumbling 
at last. Dalehouse shared her feel- 
ings: another orbit was close enough 
to another day, with nothing for 
him to do exeept to try to stay out 
of the way. 

“Yes, I agree,” said the trans- 
lator, ‘ ‘but Alex wants you to try to 
tap the the Peeps’ signals again.” 

Harriet complained, but Dale- 
house stopped listening. He shucked 
off his straps and reached wearily 
for the cassettes of data he had 
stored away for declaration. 

He plugged in, put the speaker in 
his ear and touehed the switch. 
There was a slight tape hiss, and 
occasional scratch or click, and a 
distant, somber wail. Those were 
the sounds from the wolftrap lander. 
Its primary mission was to secure 
biological samples and test them in 
its built-in laboratories; but its mi- 
crophones had picked up sounds that 
did not come from itself. He had 
listened to them fifty times already. 
After a time he shnigged, stopped 
the tape and put in a different cas- 
sette. 

This time the sounds were louder, 
clearer amd with far more defini- 
tion. The lander in this case had 
been a neutral-buoy ance floater, 
with a small reserve of thrusting 
power and a locator for carbon- 
dioxide; like a female mosquito 
seeking a blood meal to fertilize its 
eggs, it was meant to drift until if 
found a trail of CO2, then follow it 
until it found prey. Then it simply 
floated nearby as long as there were 
sounds for it to hear and transmit. 



30 



GALAXY 




But what sounds! Sometimes they 
sounded like a chorus of bagpipes, 
sometimes like teenage boys in a 
crepitation contest. Dale house had 
graphed the frequencies, from well 
below human hearing range to 
higher than a bat’s squeak, and iden- 
tified at least twenty phonemes. 
These were no bird calls; this was 
language, he was certain. 

Heat smote his exposed skin, and 
he turned back to the port; Kung 
had drifted into view, looking like a 
thin-skinned Hallowe’en pumpkin 
with the embers of Hades inside its 
mottled surface. He squinted and 
pulled a neutral-density blind over 
the porthole; it was not dangerous 
to glance at it, but there was the 
chance of burning out your cornea 
if you stared too long. 

In the warmth he felt sleepy. Why 
not? He thought, snapping off the 



tape. He leaned back, closed his 
eyes and was just drifting off when 
he heard his name called. 
“Dalehouse! Krivitin! DiPaolo! 
Front and center, everybody.” 

He shook himself awake, wished 
for a cup of coffee, and pulled him- 
self toward the workspace. The 
leader of the expedition, Alex 
Woodring, said, “You’d better all 
see this. The Peeps have filed 
another report, and Harriet’s taped 
it for us. ” 

Dalehouse wriggled closer for a 
better view of the video screen just 
as it blinked and lighted up. There 
was a plant on the screen, rust-red 
and femlike, with raspberry-like 
fruits hanging from its fronds. 
“Roll the tape, Harriet,” Woodring 
said impatiently. The pictures on 
the screen leaped and flickered, 
then stopped.

At first Dalehouse thought the 
picture was another Klongan flower, 
possibly some desert succulent: red 
and yellow blobs, oozing what he 
supposed was some sort of sap — 
then it moved. 

“Dear God,” whispered some- 
body. Dalehouse felt something rise 
in his throat. 

“What is it?” 

“I think it used to be a white 
mouse,” said the biologist. 

“What happened?” 

“That,” said the biologist, 
grimly, but with a trace of profes- 
sional satisfaction, “is what I don’t 
know yet. The Peeps are transmit- 
ting their voice reports in code.” 

“They’re supposed to share in- 
formation!” snapped Dalehouse. 

“Well, maybe they will. I as- 
sume Heir-of-Mao will have his 
UNESCO delegation deliver a re- 
port. And when it’s released in New 
York, Houston will no doubt send 
us a copy. But not very soon, I 
think. The picture was clear. When 
you come right down to it, that’s all 
we need to know: Klong is not as 
hospitable as we would like. 1 — “he 
hesitated, then went on: “I don’t 
think it’s an infectious disease. It 
looks more like an allergic reaction. 
1 can’t really imagine an alien mi- 
cro-organism adapting that quickly to 
our body chemistry, anyway. I sus- 
pect we’re as poisonous to them as 
they are to us, so, for openers, we 
don’t eat anything, we don’t drink 
anything but our own sealed 
supplies and distilled water.” 

“You mean we’re landing any- 
how?” the Canadian electronicist 
said incredulously. 

Captain Kappelyushnikov snarled, 
“Dfl!” He nodded vigorously, then 

32 



muttered to the translator, who said 
smoothly: 

“He says that that is why we 
came here. He says we will take all 
precautions. He says on the next 
orbit, we go.” 

* * * 

Dalehouse managed to sleep a 
few hours. It wasn’t hard. There 
wasn’t much for him to do. He 
played the strange songs from the 
mosquito probe a few times, but the 
equipment he needed to do any 
serious analysis had been stowed 
away and it made little sense to set 
it up again. When he woke he was 
given a tube of thick petroleum jelly 
to smear on himself — “Shuck your 
clothes and cover your whole body; 
maybe it will keep you from some 
kind of poison ivy or whatever that 
is until we get straightened out.” 
Then he dressed again and waited. 
The electronicist had patched herself 
in to monitor any further ground 
transmissions, and was pointing 
sources on a likris map of the sun- 
ward surface of Klong. 

“There seem to be two stations 
broadcasting,” Dalehouse com- 
mented. 

“Yeah. Must be the base camp 
and, I suppose, somebody off on an 
expedition. There’s the Peep 
base — ” she touched a dot on the 
purplish sea, on one side of a 
hundred-kilometer bay — ‘ ‘and 

there’s the other station.” That was 
across the bay. “We know that’s 
their base; we photographed it last 
time around. Nothing much. They 
aren’t really set up yet. I’d say. 
That signal’s pulse-coded, probably 



GALAXY 




basic science data on its way to 
their orbiter for tachyon transmis- 
sion back home.” 

‘‘What’s over on the other side of 
the bay?” 

‘‘Nothing much. There’s a sort of 
nest of some of the arthropods 
there, but they don’t_h§ve radio.” 
She pulled the earpiece'’away from 
her temple and handed it to 
Dalehouse. ‘‘Listen to that signal.” 

Dalehouse put the phone in his 
ear. The sound was a staccato, two- 
tone beep, plaintively repeated over 
and over. 

‘‘Sounds sad,” he said. 

The woman nodded. ‘‘I think it’s 
a distress signal,” she said, frown- 
ing. ‘‘Only they don’t seem to be 
answering it. ” 

V 

The fourth of the five beings was 
named Sham-igon. 

What can be said about Sham- 
igon to make him come clear and 
real? Perhaps it can be approached 
in a roundabout way. Like this: 

Suppose there is a kind and jolly 
man, the sort of person who takes 
children Fishing, dances the polka, 
reads Elizabethan verse and knows 
why Tebaldi was the greatest Mimi 
who ever lived. 

Is this Sham-igon? 

No. This is only an analogy. 
Suppose we then go on to ask you 
if you have ever met this man. You 
hesitate, riffling through the chance 
encounters of a life. No, you say, a 
finger against your nose, I don’t 
think so, I never met anybody like 
that. 

And suppose I then say to you: 
But you did I It was a week ago 



Thursday. He was driving the A-37 
bus you took from the station to the 
Federal Building, and you were late 
for your appointment with the Tax 
Examiner because this man would 
not change a five-dollar bill. 

What do you say then? I think I 
know. I think you say: Christ, fel- 
low! I remember the incident well! 
But that was no amiable folk- 
dancer. That was a bus-driver! 

That’s how it would be with 
Sham-igon. It’s easy enough to im- 
agine you meeting him (provided 
we don’t worry about how you get 
there). Let’s make the mind- 
experiment necessary to see what 
would happen. Suppose you are 
standing outside of time and space 
somehow, like an H.G. Wells god 
looking down from a cloud. You 
poke your finger into the infinitesi- 
mal. You touch Sham-igon ’s planet, 
and you uncover him. You look 
him over. 

What do you see? 

I might try to describe him to you 
by saying that Sham-igon was polit- 
ically conservative, deeply moral, 
and fundamentally honest. I might 
try to elicit your sympathy by say- 
ing that he (like who that you 
know?) was screaming inside with 
unhealed pain. 

But would you see that? 

Or would you glance, and gasp, 
and pull back your finger in loath- 
ing, and say: 

Christ, fellow! That’s no person. 
It’s an alien creature! It lives (lived? 
will live?) a thousand light-years 
away, on a planet that circles a star 
I have never even seen! And be- 
sides, it looks creepy. If I had to 
say what it looked like, giving it the 
best break I could, I would have to 



JEM 



33 




say that it looked like half of a 
paitly squashed crab. 

And, of course, you would be 
right. 

The way Sharn-igon looked to 
himself was something else again. 

For one thing, he is not an instant 
invention for your eye to see. He is 
a person. He has relationships. He 
lives in a society. He moves around 
and through a dense web or mores, 
laws, customs and folkways. He 
wasn’t like every other Krinpit (as 
his people called themselves), no 
matter how indistinguishably alike 
they might look to your eyes. He 
was Sham-igon. 

For example, although it was 
Ring-Greeting time, Sharn-igon 
hated Ring-Greeting. To him it was 
the loneliest and worst part of the 
cycle. He disliked the bustle, he re- 
sented the false and hypocritical 
sentiment. All the shops and 
brothels were busy as everyone tried 
to get gifts and to become pregnant, 
but it was an empty mockery in 
Sham-igon ’s life, because he was 
alone. 

If you had asked him, Sham-igon 
would have told you that he had 
always hated Ring-Greeting, at least 
ever since his final moulting. 
(When he was a young seed just 
beginning to wave on his mother’s 
grate he loved it, naturally enough. 
All seeds did. Ring-Greeting was 
for kids.) That wasn’t quite tme. 
The cycle before he and his he- 
wife, Cheee-pmitt, had had a very 
cheerful Greeting. 

But Cheee-pmitt was gone. 
Sham-igon signaled at his screen, 
almost stumbling over an inedible 
ghost that lay before it. There was 
no answer. He hesitated. 



Something — perhaps the ghost — 
seemed to be calling his name. But 
that was ridiculous. After a moment 
of indecision, he scuttled across the 
crowded mn to — call it a bar — to 
chew a couple of quick ones. 

Look at Sham-igon munching on 
strands of hallucinogenic fern, 
squeezed two or three deep around 
the Krinpit who was kneading and 
dispensing the stuff. He was a fine 
figure of a person. He was mas- 
culinely broad — easily two meters 
from rim to rim — and pleasingly 
slim, not more than forty centimet- 
ers to the tip of his carapace. In 
spite of his mood, unpaired males 
and females of all descriptions 
found him attractive. He was 
young, healthy, sexually potent and 
successful in his chosen profession. 

* — Well, that is not strictly tme, 
because a paradox is involved. 

Sham-igon ’s profession was a 
form of social work. The more suc- 
cessful he was, in terms of his own 
personal ego needs satisfied, the 
worse his society was. It was only 
when Krinpit were in trouble that 
they turned to persons like Sham- 
igon. The Krinpit were socially in- 
terdependant to a degree not usually 
associated with a technological cul- 
ture on Earth. Maybe one would 
find that sort of close-knit clan 
among the Eskimos or Bushmen, 
where every member of the com- 
munity had to be able to rely on 
every other, or they would all die. 
For that reason Sham-igon was 
happiest when he was least wanted. 
Ring-Greeting was bringing its 
usual crop of damaged egos, bom 
of loneliness amid the holiday 
cheer. He was busier than he had 
ever been, and so less happy. 



34 



GALAXY 




Stand on your cloud and look 
down on Sham-igon. To you he 
surely looks strange, and maybe 
quite repulsive, true. Hi^ crescent 
carapace is sprinkled with what look 
like chitinous sails. Some are a few 
centimeters high, some much smal- 
ler; and around them race, clicking 
and scraping, what look like lice. 
Actually, they aren’t. They are not 
even parasites, except in the sense 
that a foetus is a parasite on its 
mother; they are the young. Sham- 
igon is not the only Krinpit in the 
bar carrying young. Of the hundred 
individuals in the bar, eight or ten 
are in the brood-male phase. Some- 
times one of the scurrying little crea- 
tures drop off, or inadvertently 
gets carried off on the shell of 
another Krinpit as they rub together. 
They are instantly aware of what 
has happened, and go wild in the at- 
tempt to get back. If they fail, they 
die. 

Each end of Sham-igon ’s shell is 
pleated chitin, jointed with cartil- 
age. That part is always in motion, 
expanding with accordian folds, tilt- 
ing, spreading like a fan. He slides 
along the packed dirt floor or the 
bodies of Krinpit under him (in the 
conviviality of the bar no one minds 
being crawled on) on a dozen 
double-boned legs. 

After he had had three quick 
ones, feeling better, he left the bar 
and sidled down the turfy run, not 
hurrying, with no particular destina- 
tion in mind. On each side of the 
mn are what you might think of as 
rather shabby Japanese screens. 
They are not decorated in any way, 
but they are jointed and folded, and 
they come in all sizes. They set off 
the homes and commercial places. 



some of which are filled with scores 
of Krinpit, like the bar, some al- 
most empty. The screens too are 
studded with the tiny sail-like pro- 
jections, but otherwise they are not 
decorated. What you would notice 
at once is that they are not colored. 
The Krinpit do not understand 
color, and in the light of Knag’s 
Star, blood-red and dusky, you 
would not see much color eli^, 
even if it were there. 

That is how it would look to you, 
with your human eyes. How wnM 
it look to Krinpit eyes? Immatenal; 
it is a senseless question, because 
the Krinpit have no eyes. They have 
photosensitive receptors on their 
carapaces, but there is no lens, no 
retina, no mosaic of sensitive cells 
to analyze an image and translate it 
into information. 

But if the scene was dark, it was 
also noisy. 

Every one of the Krinpit was 
constantly booming its name — well, 
not its “name,” in the sense that 
the name Franklin Roosevelt’s wife 
was Eleanor. The name was not an 
arbitrary convention. It was the 
sound each Krinpit made. It was 
sound that guided them, that palped 
the world around them and returned 
information to their quite agile and 
competent brains. The sonar pulses 
they sent forth, to read the echoes, 
were their “names.” Each was dif- 
ferent, and every one always being 
produced while its owner lived. 
Their main auditory apparatus was 
the drum-tight undersurface of the 
belly. It possessed a vent like a 
dolphin’s which could produce a 
remarkable range of vowel sounds. 
The “knees” of the double-boned 
legs could punctuate them with 



JEM 



35 




tympanous “consonants.” They 
walked in music wherever they 
strolled. They could not move si- 
lently. The exact sounds they pro- 
duced were controllable; in fact, 
they had an elaborate and sophisti- 
cated language. The sounds which 
became their recognition signals 
were probably the easiest for them, 
but they could produce almost any 
other sound in the frequency range 
of their hearing. In this their voices 
were quite like humans. 

So wherever Sham-igon went he 
was surrounded by that sound: 
“Sham,” a rising, protracted noise 
like a musical saw, overlaid with 
white hiss; “igon,” a staccato dou- 
ble drumbeat dropping down to the 
tonic again. It was not just Sham- 
igon. All the Krinpit were con- 
stantly making their basic name 
sounds, when they were not making 
others. It was not just marked by 
wind-powered sound-making 
machines. Nearly all of them had 
ratchets, or droning pipes, or bull- 
roarers, or circle-bowed strings 
clamoring out their own particular 
recognition signal. 

So to a human eye, Sham-igon 
was a lopsided crab scuttling in a 
clattering mass of others, in hellish 
red gloom with an infernal 
cacophony of sound coming from 
every direction. 

Sham-igon perceived it quite dif- 
ferently. He was strolling aimlessly 
along a well-remembered street. 
The street had a name; it translates 
rather closely as “The Great White 
Way.” 

At the intersection of the 
Breeder’s Wallow, Sham-igon fell 
into conversation with an acquain- 
tance. 



“Do you have knowledge of 
whereabouts of Cheee-pmitt?” 
“Negative. Conjecture; statisti- 
cally probable that he would be by 
lakeside of village.” 

“Why?” 

“Some persons hurt or ill. Sev- 
eral anomalous ghosts reported.” 
Sham-igon acknowledged the 
statements and turned toward the 
lakefront. He recalled that there had 
seemed to be a ghost near Cheee- 
pmitt ’s residence, some time be- 
fore. And it was anomalous. Basi- 
cally there were two kinds of 
ghosts. The Ghosts Above were 
common, and easily “visible” (be- 
cause they made so much noise), 
but returned no echo signal to speak 
of to a Krinpit ’s sonar. They were 
good eating when they could be 
caught. The Ghosts Below were al- 
most invisible. They seldom made 
visible sounds, and returned not 
much echo; they were mostly ob- 
served when their underground dig- 
ging damaged a Krinpit stmcture or 
farm. They too were good eating, 
and were systematically hunted for 
that purpose, when the Krinpit were 
lucky enough to locate a nest of 
young. 

But what was an anomalous 
ghost? 

Sham-igon scuttled through the 
Breeders’ Wallow to the Place of 
Fish Vendors, and along the lake- 
front to the bright commotion at the 
Raft Mooring. There was something 
almost invisible bobbing in the gen- 
tle roll of the bay. The Krinpit used 
metal only very sparingly, and 
Sham-igon recognized the bright- 
ness of it; but the bright metal 
seemed to float over something so 
soft and immaterial that it returned 



36 



GALAXY 




no real reflection to his sounding. 
The bright part, though, not only re- 
flected Sharn-igon’s sounds almost 
blindingly, it generated sound of its 
own: a faint high steady whine, an 
irregular dry-sand rustle. Sham-igon 
could not identify the sounds; but 
then, he had never seen a TV cam- 
era or a radio transponder. 

He stopped one of the Krinpit 
moving irritably away from the 
group and asked what was happen- 
ing. 

“Some Krinpit attempted to eat 
the ghost. They are damaged.” 

“Did the ghost harm them?” 

“Negative. After eating, they be- 
came damaged. One ghost is still 
there. Advise against eating.” 

Sham-igon touched mandibles 
and moved on, concerned about 
Cheee-praitt. He didn’t hear him 
anywhere in the crowd, but the din 
was blinding. At least two hundred 
Krinpit were scratching and sliding 
over each other’s carapaces, milling 
around the bloody mass that had 
been one of the “ghosts. " Sham 
igon halted and sounded tlie area, 
irresolutely. 

From behind him he thought n ■ 
heard his own name, badly spoken 
but recognizable: Sham-igon . When 
he turned, his highly directional 
sound sense identified the source. It 
was the ghost. The one that had 
seemed to speak his name. Sham- 
igon approached it cautiously; he 
did not like its smell, he didn’t like 
its muffled, shadowy sound. But it 
was a curiosity. First his own name: 
Sham-igon. And in between — what? 
Another name? It was certainly not 
B Krinpit name, but the ghost kept 
repeating it. It sounded like OCK 
med dool LAH.

* * * 

On the other shore of the Bay of 
the Cultural Revolution, fifty 
kilometers away, Feng Hua-tse 
rinsed the honey buckets in the 
purplish waters and carried them 
back toward the bubble cluster that 
was the People’s Bloc headquarters. 
From the shore you couldn’t see the 
landing craft itself at all. The ex- 
truded bubbles surrounded and hid 
it. Through the translucent walls of 
the nearest of them (they could have 
been made opaque, but the group 
decision had been that energy con- 
servation was more important than 
privacy) he could see the vague 
shadows of the two women detailed 
as sickbay orderlies. They had not 
been given the job because they 
were women. They had got the job 
because they should have been in 
bed themselves. Barely able to 
stagger, they could more or less 
take care of themselves and the two 
bed cases. And there was no one to 
spare to do it for them. 

Feng put the clean buckets inside 
the sickbay bubble, resenting the 
waste of the precious nightsoil. But 
it was his own decision that the 
wastes from the casualties should be 
dumped in the bay rather than used 
to fertilize their tiny plot of garden. 
Until they were sure what had killed 
one member of the expedition and 
put four more on the sick list — 
nearly half their effectives wiped 
out at one stroke! — Feng would not 
risk contamination. It was a pity 
that their biologist was the sickest 
of the survivors; his wisdom was 
needed. But Feng had been a 
barefoot biologist himself in his 
youth, and he kept up the experi- 

37 




ments with the animals, the tachtran 
reports back to Peking and the 
four-times-daily examinations of the 
sick. 

He paused in the radio room. The 
video screen that monitored the 
small party which had crossed the 
bay was still showing the same 
monotonous scene. Apparently the 
camera had been left on the raft, 
and apparently the raft had drifted 
in the slow, vagrant currents of the 
bay, so that the camera showed 
only an occasional thin slice of 
shoreline, a quarter of a kilometer 
away. Once in a while you could 
see one of the arthropods scuttling 
along, and now and again a glimpse 
of their low, flimsy buildings. But 
he had not yet seen either Ahmed 
Dulla or the Costa Rican who had 
gone with him. 

Outside the bubble for the com- 
munications equipment, the two 
West Indians were desultorily 
scooping dirt into woven baskets. 
Feng spoke sharply to them and 
achieved a momentary acceleration 
of pace. They were sick, too, but it 
was not yet clear whether it was the 
same sickness as the others. They, 
he thought bitterly, should feel at 
home here. The heat and the humid- 
ity were jungle-like. What was 
worst was the lighting, always the 
same dusky red, never bright 
enough to see clearly, never dusk. 
Feng had had a headache since they 
rrrived, and it was his private opin- 
ion it was only from eyestrain. 
Feng, at least had not eaten any 
Klongan food. In this he was luck- 
ier, or wiser, than the four in the 
sickbay and the one who had died, 
not to mention the dozen rats and 
guinea pigs they fed with the stuff 



experimentally. Feng swore. Why 
had he let that long-nosed hillman, 
Dulla, talk him into splitting their 
forces? To be sure, it had happ>ened 
before the five became violently ill. 
Even so, it had been a mistake. 
When he got back to Shensi, Feng 
admitted to himself, there would be 
a long day of self-criticism for him- 
self. 

If he got back. 

He picked up two baskets of dirt 
in his shoulder yoke and carried 
them with him as he went to inspect 
the dam. That was his greatest 
hope. When it was completed, they 
would have electricity to spare. 
Electricity to power the ultraviolet 
lamps, still stored in the landing 
craft’s hold, that would turn the 
feeble, pale seedlings into sturdy 
crops of food. There was nothing 
wrong with this soil! No matter how 
many got sick, even if they died, it 
was not the soil’s fault; Feng had 
rubbed it between finger and thumb, 
sniffed it, turned a spadeful over 
and gazed wonderingly at the crawl- 
ing things that inhabited it. They 
were strange, but they meant the 
soil was fertile. What it did not 
have was proper sunlight. That they 
would have to make, as soon as the 
dam was built; and then, Feng 
swore, they would produce crops 
that any collective in Shensi Pro- 
vince would envy. 

It was raining as he started back, 
slow, fat, warm drops that ran 
down Feng’s back under his cotton 
jacket. Another good thing: plenty 
of water. Not only was it good for 
the plants, but it kept the spores 
down, and Feng was highly suspici- 
ous of them as the source of the 
sickness. Even through the clouds 



38 



GALAXY 




he could feel the warmth of Kung 
Fu-tze. It was not visible, but it 
gave the clouds the angry, ruddy 
look of sky over a distant great city. 
U would stay that way until the air 
mass that carried the clouds moved 
away; then there would be that dis- 
tant hot coal, and the purple-black 
sky with its stars. 

Feng took the forest path back to 
the headquarters, checking the 
traps. One held two multilegged 
creatures like land-going lobsters, 
one dead, the other eating it. Feng 
dumped them both and did not reset 
the trap. There was no point in it. 
They were too short-handed to 
bother with more animal specimens 
than they had already. Three of the 
traps were sprung but empty, and 
one was simply missing. Feng mut- 
tered to himself irritably. There was 
a lot they didn’t know about the 
fauna of this fern forest. For one 
thing, what had stolen the trap? 
Most of the creatures they had seen 
were arthropods, buglike or 
crustacean- like, none of them bigger 
than a man’s hand. Bigger ones ex- 
isted. The sentiments in the settle- 
ment across the bay were proof of 
that; they were the size of a man. 
But the wild ones, if they existed, 
stayed out of sight. And there was 
something that lived in the tall, 
woody ferns. One could hear them, 
even catch a glimpse of them from 
time to time, but no one in the ex- 
pedition had yet caught or even 
photographed one. It stood to rea- 
son that if there were small crea- 
tures there would be bigger ones to 
eat them, but where were they? And 
what would they look like? Wolf 
teeth, cat talons, crab claws? — Feng 
abandoned that line of thought: it 



was not reassuring. To be sure, the 
local fauna would no doubt find 
humans as indigestible as the hu- 
mans had found the local fauna. 

But they might not realize that in 
time. 

It began to look as though hu- 
mans would not find anything at all 
to eat on Klong. The biologist had 
been reduced to taking samples of 
micro-organisms from each member 
of the party and culturing them on 
plates of agar. It was no longer pos- 
sible to use laboratory animals. 
They had all died. And one by one 
he tried every promising looking bit 
of plant or animal they brought 
him, dropping a broth of it onto the 
agar, and one by one each of them 
destroyed the darkening circle of 
growing bacteria. They were perfect 
antibiotics. Except for one thing: 
they would have killed the patient 
more quickly than any disease. 

Feng became aware that his name 
was being called. 

He turned away from the place 
where the last trap had been, trot- 
ting back toward the settlement. As 
he approached the beach and the 
fronds thinned, he saw one of the 
walking casualties waving in ex- 
citement. 

Feng trotted back, arriving out of 
breath. “What, what?’’ he grum- 
bled. 

“A radio message from the long 
nose! It is a distress signal, Hua- 
tse.’’ 

“Tchah! What did he say?’’ 

“He said nothing, Hua-tse. It is 
the automatic distress call. I tried to 
raise him but there was no re- 
sponse.’’ 

“Of course,’’ snarled Feng, grip- 
ping his hands together in anger.

Another thing to admit to before the 
commune. Two members of the 
party endangered, perhaps lost, be- 
cause he had foolishly permitted the 
division of their forces. Two irre- 
placeable persons — a hillman and a 
Hispanic, to be sure; nevertheless, 
persons. Their absence would be 
serious. And not just the persons. 
One of their three television 
cameras. The radio transponder^ 
The precious plastic that had gone 
into making the skin of the &>at. 
There was just so much of that. 
They had squandered a great deal 
on the bubbles to house the sick, 
the equipment, all their sparse pos- 
sessions. That was foolishness, too; 
the fern forest was a limitless sup- 
ply of woody stems for frames, 
fronds for ceilings and walls. In this 
drenched warmth they needed no 
more than that, but he had weakly 
permitted the blowing of bubble 
huts instead of using what nature 
provided. 

Could they build another boat? 
It was by no means sure that there 
was plastic enough even for the hull 
and the sails; and when it was gone, 
where would they get more? Who 
could he send? Of their original 
eleven, one was dead, two were 
missing and four were sick. Was it 
not even more foolish to further di- 
vide their forces, to attempt to re- 
pair the damage the first foolishness 
had cost? And what could they do if 
they did in fact build another boat 
and sail across the bay? That which 
had happened to the hillman and the 
Hispanic could just as well happen 
to whoever went after them. They 
had very little in the way of 
weapons, no more to spare than 
Dulla and the other man had taken 



with them in the first place, and lit- 
tle enough good that had done 
them — 

“Are we going, Hua-tse?” 

His attention was jarred back. 
What?” 

“Are we going to try to help our 
comrades?” 

Feng gripped his hands tighter. 
“With what?” he demanded. 

VI 

On a planet that has no night the 
days are endless, Danny Dalehouse 
reflected, a meter down into the 
Klongan soil and at least that much 
more to go. His muscles told him 
he had been digging this latrine for 
at least eight hours. The discourag- 
ingly tiny spoil heap beside him 
contradicted it, and the mddy glow 
that backlighted the clouds overhead 
offered no help. Latrine digging 
was not what he had signed on for. 
But it was something that had to be 
done, and he was clearly the most 
superfluous member of the party in 
line to do it; only why did it have 
to take so long? 

They had been on the planet only 
three days (not that there were any 
days, but the old habits died hard), 
and already the pleasure was wear- 
ing thin. The parts that weren’t ac- 
tively unpleasant, like digging la- 
trines, were a bore. The parts that 
weren’t already boring were scary, 
like the madly violent thunderstorm 
that had blown away their first tent 
only hours after landing, or irritat- 
ingly uncomfortable, like the itchy 
rashes they had all developed and 
the stomach troubles that had made 
the latrines so vital. And to make it 
worse, they seemed to have com-

pany. Kappelyushnikov had come 
swearing in Russian to report that a 
third tachtran vessel had climbed 
down its charge state to orbit 
Klong. Greasies, no doubt. That 
meant everybody in the world was 
now represented on Klong. What 
price the solitary pioneer? 

His spade struck air. 

Danny lost his balance, spun and 
came down in a foetal crouch into 
the pit, his face almost into the hole 
that had unexpectedly opened up. 
From it came a cool, musty smell. 
It made him think of unopened cel- 
lars and the cages of pet mice, and 
he heard quick, furtive movements. 

Snakes'? He rejected the thought 
as soon as he formed it. That was 
an earthly fear, not appropriate on 
Klong. But whatever it was could 
easily be even more deadly than a 
nest of rattlers. He leaped with pru- 
dent speed out of the trench and 
yelled, “Morrissey!” 

The biologist was only a few 
meters away, sealing plant samples 
pickled in preservative into plastic 
baggies. “What’s the matter?” 

“I hit a hole. Maybe a tunnel. 
You want to take a look?” 

Morrissey looked down at the 
purplish seed pod in his forceps and 
back at Dalehouse’s trench, tom. 
Then he said, “Sure, only I have to 
finish stowing these away first. 
Don’t dig any more till I finish.” 
That was welcome. Dalehouse 
accepted the order gratefully. He 
was getting used to taking orders. 
Even as a latrine digger he was sub- 
ject to instant draft, whenever some 
presently more valuable member of 
the expedition needed another pair 
of hands: Harriet to set up her 
radio, Morrissey to heat-seal his 



baggies, helping Sparky Cerbo lo- 
cate the canned tomatoes and the 
kitchen knives that had vanished 
during the thunderstorm — anyone. 
Twice already he had had to empty 
the landing vehicle’s chemical toilet 
into a shallow pit and scrape the 
soil of Klong over it, because the 
rest of the crew couldn’t wait for 
him to finish the job they were pre- 
venting him from finishing. 

It was a drag. But he was on Son 
of Kung! He could smell the strange 
Klongan smells — cinnamon, and 
mold, and cut vegetation and some- 
thing that was a little like Mom’s 
Apple Pie, but none of them really 
any of those things. He could see 
the Klongan landscape — he could 
see quite a lot of it, a shovelful at a 
time. ^ 

It was what he had expected, in 
an expedition of specialists. 
Dalehouse was not a cook, not a 
farmer, not a doctor, not a radio 
surveyor. He was not any of the 
hypertrophied skills that all the 
others possessed. He was the expe- 
dition’s only generalist, and would 
stay that way until they made con- 
tact with the local scientists and he 
could start with the communications 
skills he was advertised to have. 
Until then he was stoop labor. 

The Russian pilot, Kap- 
pelyushnikov, was yelling his name. 
“You, Danny, you come have 
drink. Put back sweat!” 

“Why not?” Danny was pleased 
to notice that cappy was holding 
aloft a glass containing a centimeter 
of water, grinning broadly. He had 
finally got the still to working. 
Dalehouse swallowed the few drops 
and wiped his lips appreciately, 
then his slippery brow. Kap- 



JEM 



41 




pelyushnikov was right enough 
about that. In the dank, humid air 
they were both covered with sweat. 
The still was powered with a small 
oil-spray flame which made it like 
burning hundred-dollar bills to op- 
erate. Later it would be moved to 
the lakeshore* and driven by solar 
power, but right now they needed 
water they could drink. “Very 
good, is it?” Kappelyushnikov de- 
manded. “You don’t feel faint, like 
it’s some poison? Okay. Then we 
go bring a drink to Gasha.” 

The translator had given herself 
command of the setting-up phase of 
the camp and no one had resisted; 
she was spending hours over her 
radio, trying to make sense of the 
communications, but she claimed 
the other half of her mind was able 
to keep track of everyone’s duty as- 
signments. She might have been 
right, Dalehouse thought. She was 
the least agreeable person on the 
expedition, and no one particularly 
wanted to disagree with her. She 
was also close to the least physi- 
cally attractive, with stringy black 
hair and an expression of permanent 
disapp>ointment. But she was grudg- 
ingly grateful for the water. ‘ Thank 
you for getting the still going. And 
the latrine, of course, Danny. Now 
if the two of you — ” 

“I’m not finished,” Danny cor- 
rected. “Jim wants to check out a 
hole first. Is there anything new on 
the radio?” 

Harriet smiled with closed lips. 
“We have a message from the 
Peeps.” 

“About that guy that’s stuck?” 

“Oh, no. Take a look.” She 
handed over a facsimile film that 
said: 



The People’s Republics extend 
the hand of friendship to the sec- 
ond expedition to arrive on Child 
of Kung. Through peaceful 
cooperation we will achieve a 
glorious triumph for all mankind. 
We invite you to join us for the 
celebration of the fifteen hun- 
dredth anniversary of the writ- 
ings of Confucius, after whom 
our star was named. 

Dalehouse was perplexed. “Isn’t 
that some kind of a winter holi- 
day?” 

“You are very informed today, 
Dalehouse. It is in December. Our 
instructor called it the Confucian 
answer to Chanukkah, which is of 
course the Jewish answer to Christ- 
mas.” 

He frowned, trying to 
remember — already, it was becom- 
ing hard. “But this isn’t even Oc- 
tober yet.” 

“You are very swift indeed, 
Danny. So translate that, won’t 
you?” requested the translator. 

“I don’t know. Are they saying 
something like, don’t bother us for 
a couple of months.” 

“Is more like to drop dead,” the 
pilot put in. 

“I don’t think so. They aren’t 
being unfriendly,” Harriet said, re- 
capturing the fax and squinting at it. 
“Notice that they referred to Kung 
Fu-tze by the latinized form of the 
name. That’s a pretty courteous 
thing for them to do. Still — ” She 
frowned. At her best Harriet’s eyes 
were always faintly popped, like a 
rabbit’s, because of the heavy con- 
tacts she wore. Now her lips were 
pursed like a rabbit’s, too. “On 
the other hand, they were careful to

GALAXY 




point out we’re the second expedi- 
tion.” 

‘‘Meaning they’re the first. But 
what’s the difference? They can’t 
make territorial claims because they 
got here ahead of us, that’s all 
spelled out in the U.N. accords. 
Nobody get to claim any more than 
a circle fifty kilometers around a 
self-sustaining base.” 

‘‘But they’re pointing out that 
they could have.” 

Cappy was bored with the pro- 
tocol. ‘‘Any love-letters from the 
Oilies, Gasha?” 

‘‘Just a a received-and-acknowl- 
edged. And now, that latrine — ” 

‘‘In a minute, Harriet. What 
about the Pak that’s stranded?” 
‘‘He’s still stranded. You want to 
hear the latest tapes?” She didn’t 
wait for an answer, she knew what 
it would be. She plugged in a coil 
of tape and played it for them. It 
was the Peep’s automatic distress 
signal; every thirty seconds a coded 
SOS, followed by a five-second 
beep for homing. Between signals 
the microphone stayed open, trans- 
mitting whatever sounds were com- 
ing in. 

‘‘I’ve cut out most of the dead- 
wood. Here’s the man’s voice.” 
Neither Dalehouse nor Kappel- 
yushnikov included Urdu among 
their skills. ‘‘What is he say?” 
asked the pilot. 

‘‘Just asking for help. But he’s 
not in good shape. Most of the time 
he doesn’t talk at all, and we get 
this stuff. ” 

What came out of the tape player 
was a little like an impossibly huge 
cricket’s chirp and quite a lot like a 
Chinese New Year festival in which 
Australian aborigines were playing 



their native instruments. 

‘‘What the hell is that?” Danny 
demanded. 

“That,” she said smugly, ‘‘is 
also language. I’ve been working on 
it, and I’ve sorted out a few key 
concepts. They are in some sort of 
trouble. I’m not sure what.” 

‘‘Not as much as Pak’s,” grunted 
Kappelyushnikov. ‘‘Come, Danny, 
is time we go to work.” 

‘‘Yes, that latrine is—” 

‘‘Not on latrine! Other things in 
life than shit, Gasha.” 

She paused, glowering at him. 
Kappelyushnikov was almost as 
dispensible as Danny Dalehouse. 
Maybe more so. After the expedi- 
tion was well established, 
Dalehouse ’s skills would come into 
play, or so they all hoped, in mak- 
ing contact with sentient life. The 
pilot’s main skill was piloting. A 
spacecraft by choice. If press^, a 
clamjet, a racing vessel or a canoe. 
None of those existed on Klong. 

But what he had was resource- 
fulness. ‘‘Gasha, dear,” he coaxed, 
‘‘is not possible. Your Morrissey 
still has his micetraps in the trench. 
And besides, now we have water, 1 
have to make sauerstqff. ” 

“Hydrogen,” Harriet corrected 
automatically. “Hydrogen? What in 
the world do you want with hydro- 
gen?” 

“So 1 will have a job, dear 
Gasha. To fly. ” 

“You’re going to fly with hydro- 
gen?” 

“You understand me, Gasha,” 
the Russian beamed. He pointed. 
“Like them.” 

Danny glanced up, then ran for 
the tent and the one remaining de- 
cent pair of binoculars — two pairs

of them, too, had turned up missing 
after the thunderstorm. 

There they were, the wind-blown 
flock of balloonists, high and near 
the clouds. They were at least two 
kilometers away, too far to hear the 
sounds of their song, but in the 
glasses Dalehouse could see them 
clearly enough. In the purplish sky 
they stood out in their brigl^t greens 
and yellows. It was true, Dalehouse 
verified. Some of them were self- 
luminous, like fireflies! Traceries of 
veins stood out over the great 
five-meter gas bag of the largest 
and nearest of them, flickering with 
racing sparks of bioluminescence. 

“Damn,” he snarled. “What are 
you saying, Cappy? Do you think 
you can fly up there?” 

“With greatest of ease, Danny,” 
the pilot said solemnly. “Is only a 
matter of making bubbles and put- 
ting sauersfqff in them. Then we 
fly.” 

“You’ve got a deal,” said 
Dalehouse firmly. “Tell me what to 
do and I’ll do it. I’ll — wait a min- 
ute! What’s that?” 

The balloon swarm was scatter- 
ing, and behind them, coming 
through the place they were vacat- 
ing, was something else, something 
that beat with a regular metric flash 
of light. 

The sound reached him, then. 
“It’s a helicopter!” he cried in as- 
tonishment. 

* * * 

The chopper pilot was short, dark 
and Irish. Not only Irish, but repa- 
triated to the U.K. from eleven 
years in Houston, Texas. He and 
Morrissey hit it off immediately. 
“Remember Bismarck’s?” “Ever 



been to La Carafe?” “Been there? I 
lived there!” And when they were 
all gathered he said: 

“Glad to meet you all. Name’s 
Terry Boyne, and I bring you offi- 
cial greetings from our expedition, 
that’s the Organization of Fuel Ex- 
porting Nations, to yours, that’s 
you. Nice place you’ve got here,” 
he went on appreciatively, glancing 
around. “We’re down toward the 
heat pole — ask my opinion, you 
folks picked a better spot. Where 
we are it’s wind you wouldn’t be- 
lieve and scorching hot besides, if 
you please.” 

“So why’d you pick it?” asked 
Morrissey. 

“Oh,” said Boyne, “we do what 
our masters tell us. Isn’t it about the 
same with you? And what they told 
me to do today was to come over 
and make a good-neighbor call.” 
Harriet, of course, stepped right 
in. “On behalf of the Food- 
exporting States we accept your 
greetings and in return — ” 

“Please to stow, Harriet?” rum- 
bled Kappelyushnikov. “But we are 
not only other colony on Klong, 
Terry Boyne.” 

“Or even the first, as the Peeps 
have reminded us,” Danny added. 
“Have you been to see them?” 
Boyne coughed. “Well, actually 
that’s more or less what it’s about, 
if you see what 1 mean. Have you 
people been monitoring their broad- 
casts?” 

“Sure we have. Yours too.” 
“Right, then you’ve heard their 
distress signals. Poor sod stuck with 
those Krinpit beasts. The Peeps 
don’t respond. We offered to help 
out, and they as much as told us to 
fuck off.” Morrissey glanced at 



44 



GALAXY 




Harriet before he said, “We’ve had 
much the same experience, Terry. 
They indicated we weren’t welcome 
in their part of the world. Of 
course, they have no right to take 
that kind of a stand — ’’ 

“ — but you. don’t want to start 
any bloc-to-bloc trouble,’’ finished 
Boyne, nodding. “Well, for hu- 
manitarian reasons — ’’ He choked, 
and took a great swig of the drink 
Morrissey had handed him before 
going on. “Hell, let’s be frank. For 
curiosity’s sake, and just to see 
what’s going on over there — but 
also for humanitarian reasons — we 
want to go and fish they guy out of 
there. The Peeps obviously can’t. 
We suppose the reason they shut 
you and us out is that they don’t 
want us to see how bad off they 
are. You folks can’t — ’’ He hesi- 
tated delicately. “Well, obviously it 
would be easier for us to go in with 
a chopper than for you to send an 
expedition overland. We’re willing 
to do that. But not alone, if you see 
what I mean.’’ 

“1 think I do,’’ Harriet sniffed. 
“You want somebody to share the 
blame.’’ 

“We want to make it a clearly 
interbloc errand of mercy,” Boyne 
corrected. “So I’m all set to go 
over there and snatch him out, this 
minute. But I’d like one of you to 
go along. ” 

Eight out of the ten members of 
the expedition were spteaking at 
once then, with Kappelyushnikov ’s 
shouted, “1 go!” drowning out the 
rest. Harriet glared around at her 
crew and then said petulantly: 

“Go then, if you want to, al- 
though we’re so shorthanded 
here — ” 



Danny Dalehouse didn’t wait for 
her to finish. “That’s right, Harriet! 
And that’s why it ought to be me. I 
can be spared, and besides — ” 

“No! I, I can be spared, Danny! 
And I am pilot — ” 

“Sorry, Gappy,” said Danny 
confidently. “We already have a 
pilot — Mr. Boyne, there — and be- 
sides you have to make your 
sauerstojf so you can take me flying 
when I come back. And, two, mak- 
ing contact with alien sentients is 
my basic job, isn’t it? And — ” he 
didn’t wait for an answer — 
“besides, I think I know the guy 
that’s stuck there. Ahmed Dulla. 
We were both hassled by the cops 
in Bulgaria a couple of months 
ago.” 

* * * 

Wook. Wook. Wook. changed to 
whickwhickwhickwhick as the pilot 
increased the pitch of the rotors and 
the copter rocked off the ground 
and headed for a cloud. Danny 
clung to the seat, marveling at the 
profligacy with which the Fuel Bloc 
spent its treasure — four metric tons 
of helicopter alone, tachyon- 
transported from Earth orbit at what 
cost in resources he could not 
guess. 

“You don’t get airsick, do you? 
shouted Boyne over the noise of the 
blades. Danny shook his head, and 
the pilot grinned and deflected the 
blade edges so that the chopper 
leaned toward, and began to move 
after, a bank of cumulus. To Dan- 
ny’s disappointment, the flock of 
balloonists was out of sight, but 
there were still small and large crea- 



46 



GALAXY 




tures in the air, keeping their dis- 
tance. Dalehouse couldn’t see them 
very clearly, and suspected they 
wanted it that way, staying at the 
limits of vision and disappearing 
into cloud as the copter came close. 
But below! That was laid out for 
him to enjoy as the chopper 
bounced along, less than fifty me- 
ters over the tallest growth. Groves 
of trees like bamboo, clusters of 
thirty-meter ferns, tangles of things 
like mangroves, twenty or more 
trunks uniting to form a single 
cat’s-cradle tangle of vegetation. He 
could see small things scuttling and 
leaping to hide as they twisted 
overhead, colors of all sorts. The 
unwinking red glower of the dwarf 
star toned down rock and water, but 
the brightest colors were not reflec- 
tions. They were foxfire glow and 
lightning-bug tail, the lights of the 
plants themselves. 

Of course Dalehouse had studied 
the maps of Klong, orbital photos 
supplemented by side-scatter radar. 
But this was different, seeing the 
landscape as they soared above it. 
Back along the shore was their own 
camp, on a narrow neck of land that 
locked off a bay from the wider 
ocean, or lake, a kilometer or two 
away. There was the lake (or ocean) 
itself, curving around like a bitten- 
into watermelon slice, and, in the 
light from Kung, almost the same 
color. Down the shore of it was the 
Peeps’ encampment. Past that, off 
toward the part of Klong that lay 
Just under the star, where the land 
was dryer and the temperatures even 
higher, was the Greasies’ camp. 
Both of those were out of sight, of 
course. The copter swung out across 
the water. Boyne pointed, and 



Dalehouse nodded; he could see the 
place where they were going just 
taking form through the gloomy 
haze, on the far shore. 

Boyne had not been entirely 
frank, Dalehouse discovered. He 
had not mentioned that this was not 
his first flight to the Krinpit com- 
munity. There had been at least two 
overflights before that, because 
there were photos of the layout. 
Boyne pulled a sheaf of them out of 
an elastic pocket in the door of the 
copter, sorted through them and 
passed one over to Danny. “There, 
by the water’s edge!’’ he bawled. 
His finger jabbed at a curled-up fig- 
ure a few meters from the water’s 
edge. Drawn up nearby was a plas- 
tic coracle, and there were sheds 
and more obscure structures all 
around. There were also some very 
unpleasant looking creatures like 
square-ended crabs: Krinpit. Some 
of them were suspiciously close to 
the huddled figure. 

“Is he still alive?’’ Danny 
shouted. 

“Don’t know. He was a day or 
two ago. He’s probably okay for 
water, but he must be getting 
damned hungry by now. And prob- 
ably sick.’’ 

From the air the Krinpit village 
looked like a stockyard, most of the 
structures comprising only unroofed 
walls, like cattle pens. The crea- 
tures were all around, Danny saw, 
moving astonishingly quickly, at 
least when matched against his 
image of Earthside crustaceans. And 
they were clearly aware the chopper 
was approaching. Some raised up to 
point their blind faces toward it, 
and an ominous number seemed to 
be converging on the waterside.

“Creepy looking things, ain’t 
they?” Boyne shouted. 

“Listen,” said Danny, ”how are 
we going to get Dulla away from 
them? They don’t just look creepy. 
They look mean.” 

“Yeah.” Boyne rolled down his 
window and I’eaned out, circling the 
helicopter around. He shook his 
head, then pointed. “That your 
buddy?” 

The figure had moved since the 
photograph was taken, was no 
longer in the shelter of one of the 
sheds but a few meters away and 
lying outstretched, face down. Dulla 
didn’t look particularly alive, but he 
wasn’t clearly dead, either. 

Boyne frowned thoughtfully, then 
turned to Dalehouse. “Open that 
case between your feet there, will 
you, and hand me a couple of those 
things.” 

The “things” were metal cylin- 
ders with a wire loop at the end. 
Boyne took half a dozen, pulled the 
loops and tossed them carefully to- 
ward the Krinpits. As they struck, 
billowing yellow clouds of smoke 
came out of them, forming a dense 
cloud. The Krinpit staggered out of 
the smoke as though disoriented. 

“Just tear gas,” Boyne grinned. 
“They hate it.” He stared down. 
Nearly all the creatures that had 
been converging around the prone 
man were fleeing now. all but 
one. 

That one was obviously in dis- 
tress, but it did not leave the vicin- 
ity of the prone human being. It 
seemed to be in pain. It moved dart- 
ingly back and forth as though tom 
between conflicting imperatives: to 
flee; to stay; perhaps even to fight. 
“What are we going to do about 



that son of a bitch?” Boyne won- 
dered out loud, hovering over the 
scene. But then the creature moved 
painfully away and Boyne made his 
decision. He dropped to the ground 
between the Krinpit and the uncon- 
scious Pakistani. “Grab ’im, 
Danny!” he yelled. 

Danny flung open his door and 
jumped out. He scooped up the 
Pakistani with more difficulty than 
he had expected. Dulla did not 
weigh much more than fifty kilos 
here, but he was boneless as rubber, 
completely out of it. Danny got him 
under the arms and more dragged 
than carried him into the helicopter, 
while Boyne swore worriedly. The 
rotors spun and they started to lift 
off, and there was a rushing, clatter- 
ing scramble from the other side. 
Two hundred kilograms of adult 
Krinpit launched itself onto the 
side-pallette. Boyne gibbered in 
rage and jockeyed the controls. The 
chopper staggered and seemed about 
to turn on its side; but he got it 
straight and it began to pull up and 
away. 

“What are you going to do, 
Boyne?” yelled Danny, trying to 
pull Dulla ’s legs inside so he could 
close the door. “You can’t just 
leave that thing there!” 

“Hell I can’t!” Boyne stared 
worriedly at the stiff-jointed legs 
that were trying to scrape through 
the plastic to get at him, then turned 
the copter up and over the water. 
“I’ve always wanted a pet. Let’s 
see if I can get this bugger home!” 

* * * 

By the time he got back to his 
own camp, full of wonder and wor-

lies, Dalehouse was physically 
exhausted. He made a quick report 
to the rest of the expedition and 
then fell into a dreamless sleep. 

“Night” was an arbitrary concept 
on Klong. When he woke the sky 
was the same as it always was, 
clouds and the dull red cinder of 
Kung hanging off-center above. 

It was back to work as usual. 
Kappelyushnikov, or somebody, 
had done some digging for him. He 
had less than an hour’s work, 
mostly neatening up the edges. He 
welcomed it, because he had more 
than an hour’s pondering to do. 

After rescuing the Pakistani, 
Boyne had laid a beeline course for 
his own home base. He had not 
even asked if Dulla were alive; his 
attention was taken up to saturation 
by the hideous and very active crea- 
ture only centimeters from his left 
ear, and by the demands of piloting. 
Warned by radio, the Greasies had 
nets prepared. They had the Krinpit 
lashed and stowed before the beast 
knew what was happening. Then a 
quick meal while Dulla got some 
sort of emergency medical treat- 
ment, mostly cleaning him up and 
flowing a little glucose into his 
bloodstream. Then over the barren, 
hot ground to the Peeps’ camp, 
where they left the sick man, ac- 
cepted some haughty thanks from 
the Qiinese in charge of the place 
and took Dalehouse home. 

All in all, he had been gone five 
or six hours. And every second 
filled with some new input to worry 
over in his mind. 

He really begrudged them the 
Krinpit. There was no doubt the 
creature was intelligent. If the build- 
ings hadn’t proved that by them- 



selves, its methodical attempt to 
gouge its way into the helicopter, 
and its patient acceptance of failure 
when the plastic proved too tough, 
spoke of thought. It had struggled 
only briefly when the Greasies 
threw the nets over it, then allowed 
itself to be hauled into a steel 
barred cage. Only after the cage 
door had slammed behind it did it 
systematically cut through the net- 
ting to free its limbs. Dalehouse had 
spent all the moments he could 
spare just watching it, and trying to 
make sense of its sounds. If only he 
had taken the brain-split at some 
point in his studies! He knew that 
Harriet or even that Bulgarian girl. 
Ana, could have reasoned out some 
sort of linguistic pattern, but it was 
only noise to him. 

Then there was the wonder of the 
Greasy camp itself. Steel bars! A 
helicopter! Bunk legs, with metal 
springs! He could not begin to 
imagine what profligate burning of 
irreplaceable fuel had made it pos- 
sible for them to hurl all that stuff 
at superflight speed to an orbit 
around Kung, and then to lower it 
safely to the surface of the planet. 
They even had air-conditioning! 
True, they needed it; the surface 
temperature must have been well 
over forty, so near to the heat pole. 
But no one forced them to settle 
where they would need the perma- 
nent drain of air conditioners to 
survive. 

And by contrast, the Peeps. That 
was pathetic. Old What’sy had put 
the l^st face possible on it, but it 
was clear that the return of Dulla 
meant to him principally another 
casualty to try to take care of, with 
hardly anybody healthy enough to 



JEM

do the nursing. Much less do any- 
thing else. He had proudly given 
the visitors to understand that 
another exp)edition was on the 
way — “nearly as big as our own.” 
But how big was that? 

Jim Morrissey interrupted his 
train of thought. The biologist had 
been out of the camp and had not 
heard the report; now he wanted it 
all over again, first hand. Dalehouse 
obliged, and then asked, “Did you 
catch anything in your micetraps?” 

“Huh? Oh.” Obviously that was 
long in Morrissey’s past by now. 
“No. 1 ran a wire-tethered probe 
down the tunnel, but it kept hitting 
blind alleys. They’re pretty smart, 
whoever they are. As soon as you 
broke into their tunnel they closed it 
off.” 

“So you don’t have any animals 
to send back to Earth?” 

“No animals? Never say it, never 
think it, Danny! I’ve got a whole 
menagerie. Crabrats and bugs, 
creepers and flyers. God knows 
what they all are. 1 think the crab- 
rats are probably related to the 
Krinpit, but you can’t really trace 
relationships until you do paleontol- 
ogy and, Christ, I haven’t even 
made a beginning on the taxonomy 
yet. And plants— Well, anyway, 
you might as well call them plants. 
They don’t have stomatas or 
mesophyll cells. Would you believe 
that?” 

“Sure 1 would, Jim.” 

“Where the photosynthetic pro- 
cess happens I don’t know,” Jim 
went on, marveling, “but it’s the 
same good old thing. Starch produc- 
tion driven by sunlight. Or what 
passes for sunlight. Six Cee Oh 
Two plus Six Aitch Two Oh still 



yields Cee-Six Aitch-Twelve Oh-Six 
and some spare oxygen, on Earth as 
it is in the heavens. Or the other 
way around.” 

“That’s starch?” Dalehouse 
guessed. 

“You bet. But don’t eat any of 
it. And keep putting that jelly on 
your skin every time it rubs off. 
There ’re congeners in all that stuff 
that will do you in.” 

“Sure.” Dalehouse ’s attention 
was wandering, and he hardly lis- 
tened as Morrissey catalogued the 
vegetation he had so far identified 
on Klong: something like grasses 
that covered the plains, succulents 
like bamboo, with hollow stems that 
would make fine structural mate- 
rials. Forests of plants that looked 
like ferns, but were fruiting and 
with woody stems. Some of them 
grew together from many trunks, 
like mangroves; others towered in 
solitary splendor, like redwoods. 
There were veins like grapes, 
spreading by transporting their 
hard-shelled seeds through the di- 
gestive tracts of animals. Some of 
them were luminous. Some were 
meat-eating, like the Venus fly-trap. 
Some — 

“That starch,” Dalehouse inter- 
rupted, pursuing his train of 
thought. “Can’t we eat it? I mean, 
sort of cook the poison out of it, 
like tapioca?” 

“Danny, stick to what you 
know.” 

“No, really,” Dalehouse per- 
sisted. “We’re shipping a lot of 
mass in the form of food. Couldn’t 
we?” 

“No. Well, maybe. In a sense. It 
takes only a little bit of their pro- 
teins to kick off a reaction I can’t 



50 



GALAXY 




handle, so don’t experiment. Re- 
member the Peeps’ white mice.” 

‘‘If they’re plants, why aren’t 
they green?” 

‘‘Well, they are, kind of. In this 
light they look purple because 
Kung’s so red. But if you shine a 
flashlight on them they’re a kind of 
greenish yellow. But, you know,” 
he went on earnestly, ‘‘it’s not the 
usual chlorophyll. Not even a por- 
phyrin derivative. They do seem to 
use a magnesium ion — ” 

‘‘I better get this finished up,” 
said Danny, patting the biologist on 
the shoulder. 

It was almost done. He lugged 
the chemical toilet from the lander 
and balanced it over the slit trench, 
and then reported to Harriet. ‘‘All 
done, first-class American crapper 
ready for use. ” 

She came over to inspect and 
then pursed her tiny lips. 
‘‘Dalehouse, do you think we’re 
animals? Can’t you at least put a 
tent over it?” 

‘‘Oh, you want the deluxe 
model.” 

‘‘And before it rains again, 
would you mind? Look at those 
clouds. Damn it, Danny, why do 1 
have to tell everybody what to do 
around here?” 



He got the tent up. But the 
storm, when it came, was a rouser. 
Lightning scored the entire sky, 
cloud to ground and air to air. Rung 
was completely obscured, not even 
a dull glow to mark where it hung 
in the sky, and the only light was 
Ihe lightning itself. The first casu- 
alty was the power system. The 



second was Danny’s outhouse tent, 
tom flying away by the 80- 
kilometer naM gusts. By the time it 
was over were drenched and 
miserable, ;^yii*d all of them were 
busy tryinyin put the camp together 
again. EaW Lansing had had no 
storms lite Klong’s, and Danny 
viewed wlH dismal foreboding the 
next few JMVs on this treacherous 
planet. he realized he had 

been mor^^llinn twenty hours with- 
out sleep to tumbled into bed and 
dreamed 0 - a warm morning in 
Bulgaria vtto a pretty blonde-haired 
woman . 

When be woke, Jim Morrissey 
was poking him. ‘‘Out. I get the 
bed next.” 

It wasn’t feally even a bed, just a 
sleeping hag on an air mattress, but 
at least k was warm and dry. 
Dalehouse wluctantly yielded it to 
the biolopli. “So the camp sur- 
vived?” 

“More or less. Don’t go near 
Harriet, thoi^. One of her radios 
is missing, and she thinks we’re all 
to blame.” As he climbed into the 
bed and stretched his legs down to 
the warm interior he said, “Cappy 
wants to show you something.” 

Danny didn’t rush to see the 
pilot; odds were, he considered^ that 
it was just some other stoop-labor 
job that needed doing. It could wait 
until he had something to eat, al- 
though, he reflected, chewing 
doggedly through a guaranteed full 
daily requirement of essential vita- 
mins and minerals (it looked like a 
dog biscuit), eating wasn’t a hell of 
a lot more fun than digging latrines. 

But that wasn’t what Kap- 
pelyushnikov had in mind. “Is no 
more manual labor for you and me 



JEM 



51 




for a while, Danny,” he grinned. 
“Have now been honored by ap- 
pointment as chief meteorologist. 
Must make more sauerstojf to check 
winds, and you help.” 

“Harriet was real shook up by 
the storm,” Dalehouse guessed. 

“Gasha^ Yes, that is what she 
wants, better weather forecasting. 
But what I want is exotic travel to 
faraway places! You will see.” 

Kappelyushnikov’s still had been 
converted to solar power, a trough 
of brackish water from the lake 
running between aluminum reflect- 
ing V’s, and the vapor trapped on a 
plastic sheet overhead. The drops 
slipped down into a tank, and part 
of the fresh water was being elec- 
trolyzed into hydrogen and oxygen. 
From the hydrogen collector, a 
seamless plastic balloon, a small 
compressor whirred at regular inter- 
vals to pump the gas into a heavy 
metal cylinder. 

Kappelyushnikov checked the pres- 
sure gauge and nodded gravely. “Is 
plenty. Now you go borrow theodo- 
lite from head boss, Gasha. Do not 
take no for an answer; and then I 
will show you something that will 
truly amaze you.” 

Fortunately for Dalehouse, Har- 
riet was somewhere else when he 
went for the theodolite, a small 
sighting telescope that looked like a 
surveyor’s transit. By the time he 
got back with it Kappelyushnikov 
had filled a plastic balloon with 
hydrogen and was expertly balanc- 
ing its lift against the weight of a 
silver ruble. “My good luck 
piece,” he said dreamily. “Yes, 
fine. You have pencil?” 

“What’s a pencil? I have a 
ballpoint.” 



“Don’t make fun of old- 
fashioned Soviet values,” Kap- 
pelyushnikov said severely, “^en 
I let go of balloon, you keep eye on 
watch. Every twenty seconds you 
tell me, I call off readings, you 
write down. You understand? Okay, 
let go.” 

The little balloon did not leap out 
of Dalehouse ’s fingers, it only 
drifted upward, bobbing gently as 
vagrant zephyrs caught it. In the 
still after the storm there was no 
strongly prevailing wind that 
Dalehouse could feel, but he could 
see the balloon move erratically. At 
each time-hack Kappelyushnikov 
read off right ascension and declina- 
tion bearings. After the seventh 
reading he began to swear, and after 
the ninth he straightened up, scowl- 
ing. “Is no good! Lousy Kungson 
light, I cannot see. Next time we 
will tie on candle.” 

“Fine, but would you mind tell- 
ing me what we’re doing? 

“Measuring winds aloft, dear 
Danny! See how balloon curved 
around, started back way it came? 
Winds at different levels blow vari- 
ous individual different directions. 
Balloons follows. We follow bal- 
loon. Now we reduce readings, and 
soon I will truly astonish you with 
more than you wish to know about 
Klongan wind patterns.” 

Dalehouse squinted thoughtfully 
at where the balloon had disap- 
peared into the maroon murk. 
“How are we going to do that?” 

“Oh, Danny, Danny. How igno- 
rant you Americans are! Simple 
trigonometry. I have right ascension 
sighting of balloon after twenty sec- 
onds, correct? So I have one angle 
of tight triangle. Second angle must 



52 



GALAXY 




be ninety degrees — you understand 
that this is so? Otherwise would not 
be right triangle. So simple subtrac- 
tion from one hundred eighty gives 
me angle remaining, and I have 
thus described triangle perfectly, 
except for dimension of sides. 
Okay. 1 now feed in dimension of 
fust side, and simple trans- 
formation — ” 

“Whoa! You didn’t measure any- 
thing. Where did you get the di- 
mension of one side?” 

“Altitude of balloon after twenty 
seconds, of course.” 

“But how do you know — ” 
“Ah,” said Kappelyushnikov 
smugly, “that is why care is so im- 
portant in weighing off balloon. 
With fixed lift, balloon rises at 
fixed rate. Lift is equal to one silver 
ruble, and so in each twenty sec- 
onds rises nine point seven three 
meters. We now perform same 
arithmetic for declination and we 
have fixed position of balloon in 
three-dimensional space. Here, walk 
while we talk.” He took the jotted 
readings from Danny and scanned 
them, frowning. “Such terrible 
writing,” he complained. “Never- 
theless, 1 can read them perhaps 
well enough to feed into the com- 
puter. Is very easy computation.” 
‘Then why do you need a com- 
puter?” 

“Oh. 1 could easily perform op- 
erations myself. But computer needs 
practice. Wait one, Danny.” 

While the Russian was mumbling 
to himself over the keyboard, Har- 
riet poked her head in the tent. 
“What are you doing?” she de- 
manded sharply. 

‘ ‘Important sc ientific research , ’ ’ 
said Kappelyushnikov airily, with- 



out looking up. To Danny's sur- 
prise, the translator did not react. 
She looked sullen, confused and 
unhappy. Her normal look was not 
so far from that that it was uncon- 
spicuous, but her normal behavior 
was a good deal more abrasive than 
her demeanor now. She came 
quietly into the tent and sat down, 
thumbing dispiritedly through her 
translation notes. 

“Have it!” cried the pilot hap- 
pily, and pressed a command but- 
ton. The liquid crystal over the 
computer flashed colored darts of 
light, then revealed a plot of wind ar- 
rows. “Colors of spectrum,” Kap- 
pelyushnikov explained. “Red is 
lowest, up to fresh grass green for 
highest. You see? At fifty meters, 
wind heading one forty-five de- 
grees, eight k.p.h. At one hundred 
meters, backing to ninety-five de- 
grees and now fifteen kilometers. 
And so on. Triumph of Soviet 
technology. ” 

Dalehouse nodded appreciatively. 
“That’s very nice, but what do we 
want to know that for?” 

“Meteorology,” Kappelyush- 
nikov grinned, winking and moving 
his head toward Harriet. The 
woman looked up and burst out: 

“Cut that out, Vissarion. I’m in 
no mood for you to make fun of 
me. Tell Dalehouse your real rea- 
son.” 

The Russian looked surprised, 
and a little thoughtful, but he 
shrugged. 

“All right. Poor American 
Danny, you are helpless without 
your machines. But not 1. I am 
pilot! I do not wish to be earthworm 
like one of those things we shit on 
in your latrine, Danny. I want 



JEM 



53 




something to fly. They will not give 
me fuel. They will not let me have 
structural materials for glider — 
would be easy, except for launch- 
ing; plenty of winds here, you see. 
But Gasha says no, so what can I 
do? I look up and see the bal- 
loonists Abating around sky and I 
say I also will be balloonist!” He 
pounded his fist on the top of the 
computer. “Have gas. Have naviga- 
tion information for winds aloft. 
Have Soviet know-how. So now I 
will make little balloon, big enough 
for me, and I will pilot again.” 

A surge of enthusiasm infected 
Dalehouse. “Hey, that’s great. 
Would it work?” 

“Of course would work!” 

“We could use it to take after 
those balloonists. Get close to them. 
Harriet, do you hear that? It would 
give us a chance to try to talk to 
diem.” 

‘That’s fine,” she said, and 
Dalehouse looked at her more 
closely. Even for Harriet she looked 
sullen. 

“What’s the matter?” he asked. 
She said, “I located the radio.” 
“The one that blew away in the 
storm?” 

She laughed, like a cartoon figure 
laughing: Heh, heh, heh. “It takes 
a real idiot to believe that one. How 
could it blow away? God-damned 
thing weighs twenty kilos. It oc- 
cured to me it might be transmit- 
ting, so I listened, and it was. I 
tried RDFing, and I got a fix right 
away. Straight down,” she said, 
staring at them. “The damn thing is 
right down underneath us in the 
ground. ” 

* * * 



A minute was still a minute. 
Danny made sure of that, because 
he had begun to doubt. His pulse 
was still forty-two in sixty seconds 
by the clock. He could hold his 
breath for three of the minutes and 
maybe a bit more. The small 
change of time had not altered in 
value. But one thousand four 
hundred and forty minutes did not 
seem to make a day any more. 
Sometimes if felt as though a whole 
day had passed, and the clock said 
only six or seven hours. Sometimes 
it would occur to him to be tired, 
and the clock would show as much 
as thirty hours since he slept last. 
Fretfully Harriet tried to keep them 
all on some regular schedule, not 
because it seem^ necessary but be- 
cause it was orderly. She failed. 
Within — what? a week? — they were 
sleeping when they wanted to and 
eating when they felt hungry, and 
marking the passage of time, if at 
all, by events. The first near visit 
by balloonists was after the big 
storm, and before the Peeps re- 
ceived their reinforcement of per- 
sonnel. The time Kappelyushnikov 
triangulated the missing radio for 
Harriet and discovered it was at 
least twenty meters underground 
was just after they sent their first 
reports and shipment of specimens 
back to Earth. And the time bal- 
loonists came to visit — 

That was a whole other thing, the 
kind of event that changes every- 
thing fore and aft. 

Dalehouse woke up with his mind 
in the sky. He did his chores. He 
helped Morrissey check his traps, 
prepared a meal of desecrated stew, 
fixed a valve in the shower stall by 
the lake. But what he was thinking 



54 



GALAXY 




of was Kappelyushnikov ’s balloons. 
Danny had talked him out of the big 
single hydrogen-filled bag; too big; 
too clumsy; too hard to manufac- 
ture, and above all too likely to kill 
its passenger if anything popped its 
skin. So they had painst^ingly 
blown a hundred pibal- sized bags, 
and the Russian had knotted up a 
netting to contain them. The aggre- 
gate lift would be as much as you 
wanted. All it took was more bal- 
loons; you could multiply them to 
lift the entire camp if you liked. But 
if one or two popped, it did not 
mean a dead aeronaut. The 
passenger would descend reasonably 
slowly — to be more accurate, they 
were optimistically hopeful the 
passenger would descend slowly. 
He might damage himself. But at 
least he would not be spread flat 
across the Klongan landscape. 

Kappelyushnikov would not allow 
Danny to do the final stages of fill- 
ing and trying the balloons — “Is 
my neck, dear Danny, so is my job 
to make sure it stays okay.” 

“But you’re taking so damn 
long. Let me help.” 

"Nyet. Is very clear,” grinned 
the pilot, “that you think pretty 
soon you too will fly my balloons. 
Maybe so. But this time I am sole 
cargo. And besides, have still static 
lift tests to finish. Until then not 
even 1 fly.” 

Dalehouse fidgeted away, dis- 
gruntled. He had been on Klong 
for — whatever length of time it was; 
a couple of weeks, at least. And the 
author of “Preliminary Studies to- 
ward a First Contact with Sub- 
technological Sentients” had yet to 
meet his first subtechnological sen- 
tient. 



Oh, he had seen them. There 
were burro wers under his feet, and 
he was sure he had caught a 
glimpse of something when Morris- 
sey exploded a charge under a pre- 
sumed tunnel. The Krinpit had been 
his fellow passenger for half an 
hour. And the balloonists were 
often in the sky, though seldom 
nearby. Three separate races to 
study and deal with! And the most 
productive thing he had done was to 
dig a latrine. 

He fidgeted his way into Har- 
riet’s tent, hoping to find that she 
had miraculously made some giant 
leap in translation of one of the 
languages — if they were languages. 
She wasn’t there, but the tapes 
were. He played the best of them 
over and over, until Kap- 
pelyushnikov came in, sweating and 
cheerful. “Static test is good. 
Plenty lift. Now we let whole mish- 
mash sit for a while, check for 
leaks. You are enjoying concert of 
airborne friends?” 

“It isn’t a concert, it’s a lan- 
guage. I think it’s a language. It’s 
not random bird calls. You can hear 
them singing in chords and har- 
monies. It’s chromatic rather 
than — do you know anything about 
music theory?” ‘ 

“Me? Please, Danny. I am 
pilot, not long-haired fiddle 
player. ’ ’ 

“Well, anyway, it’s chromatic 
rather than diatonic, but the har- 
monies are there, not too far off 
what you might hear in, say, 
Scriabin.” 

“Fine composer,” the Russian 
beamed. “But tell me. Why do you 
listen to tapes when you have real 
thing right outside?” 



JEM 



55 




Startled, Danny raised his head. 
It was true. Some of the sounds he 
was hearing came from somewhere 
outside the tent. “Also,” Kap- 
pelyushnikov went on severely, 
“you are breaking Gasha’s rice 
bowl. She is translator, not you, 
and she is .very difficult lady. So 
come now and listen to your pink 
and green friends.” 

* * * 

The balloonists had never been so 
close, or so many of them. The 
whole camp was staring up at them, 
hundreds of them, so many that 
they obscured each other and blot- 
ted out part of the sky. The red 
glower of Kung shone through them 
dimly as they passed before its disk, 
but many of them were glowing 
with their own firefly light, mostly, 
as Kappelyushnikov had said, pink 
and pale green. Their song was loud 
and clear. Harriet was there already, 
microphone extended to catch every 
note, listening critically with an ex- 
pression of distaste. That meant 
nothing. It was just the way she al- 
ways looked. 

“Why so close?” Dalehouse 
marveled. 

“I do not wish to break your rice 
bowl either, dear Danny. You are 
expert. But I think is possible they 
like what we put up for chopper 
pilot.” And Kappelyushnikov 
waved to the strobe beacon on the 
tower. 

“Um.” Danny considered a mo- 
ment. “Let’s see. Do me a favor 
and get one of the portable flood- 
lights. We’ll see them better, and 
maybe it’ll bring them even 
closer. ’ ’ 



“Why not?” The Russian disap- 
peared inside the supply tent, 
and came back with the portable in 
one hand and the batteries in the 
Other, cursing as he tried to avoid 
stumbling over the wires. He fum- 
bled with it, and its dense white 
beam abruptly extended itself to- 
ward the horizon, then danced up 
toward the balloonist. It seemed to 
excite them. Their chirps, squeals, 
flatulences and cello drones multi- 
plied themselves in a shower of grace 
notes, and they seemed to follow 
the beam. 

“How do they do that?” Harriet 
demanded fretfully. “They’ve got 
no wings or anything that I can 
see.” 

“Same as I, dear Gasha,” 
boomed the Russian. “Up and 
down, to find a truly sympathetic 
current of air. Here, you hold light. 
I must watch experts and learn!” 

The balloonists were coming 
closer. Evidently the light attracted 
them. Now that there was enough 
brightness to make the colors plain, 
the variety of their patterns was 
striking. There were cloudlike 
whorls, solid bands, cross- 
hatchings, dazzle designs that re- 
sembled World War I camouflage. 
“Funny,” said Dalehouse, staring 
longingly at the swarm. “Why 
would they have all those colors 
when they can’t see them most of 
the time?” 

“Is your opinion they can’t,” 
said Kappelyushnikov. “Light like 
beet Juice is strange to us, we see 
only the red. But for them perhaps 
is — Ho, Morrissey! Good shot!” 

Dalehouse Jumped a quarter of a 
meter as the camp’s one and only 
shotgun went off behind him. Over-

head, one of the balloonists was 
spiraling toward the ground. * “I 
get,” yelled Kappelyushnikov, and 
sprinted off to intersect its fall. 

'What the hell did you doT' 
blazed Dalehouse. 

The biologist turned a startled 
and defensive face toward him. ‘T 
collected a specimen,” he said. 

Harriet laughed disagreeably. 
“Shame on you, Morrissey. You 
didn’t get Dalehouse ’s permission to 
shoot one of his friends. That’s the 
price you pay for being a specialist 
in sentients, you fall in love with 
your subjects.” 

“Don’t be bitchy, Harriet. My 
job’s hard enough, this’ll make it 
impossible. Shooting at them is the 
surest way to drive diem away.” 
“Oh, sure, Dalehouse. Anybody 
can see they’re stampeding in ter- 
ror, right?” She waved a casual 
hand at the flock, still milling 
through the light and singing as 
they soared delightedly overhead. 

Kappelyushnikov came back with 
a rubbery sac draped over his 
shoulder. “Almost had to fight off 
one of your Krinpit friends to get 
it,” he growled. “Was big, ugly 
mother. Don’t know what I would 
have done if he had truly contested 
ownership. But he scuttled away.” 
“There are no Krinpits around 
here,” Harriet said sharply. 

“Are now, Gasha. Never mind. 
See how pretty our new pet is.” 

The creature was not dead. It did 
not seem even wounded, or at least 
there was no blood. The shotgun 
pellets had blown a hole in the gas- 
bag and nothing else. Its little face 
was working, looking like the 
countenance of an engorged tick, 
with great eyes staring at them. It 



was making the tiniest of sounds, 
almost like gasps. 

“Disgusting,” said Harriet, draw- 
ing back. “Why isn’t it scream- 
ing?” 

“If I knew the answers to 
questions like that,” said Morris- 
sey, dropping to one knee beside 
the creature to see it better, “I 
wouldn’t have to collect specimens, 
would I? But at a guess, it would 
be, if I hadn’t shot the breath out of 
it. I think it uses the hydrogen for 
vocalizing. God knows what it 
breathes. Must be oxygen, of 
course, but — ” He shook his head, 
and glanced up. “Maybe I ought to 
collect a few more.” 

“No!” 

“Christ, Dalehouse! You know, 
Harriet’s right about you? Well — I 
know. At least let’s see how photo- 
tropic they are. Hand me those 
shells.” Zvonkov passed over the 
plastic belt of ammunition, and 
Morrissey pawed through it until he 
found a signal flare. 

“You’ll set fire to them, Morris- 
sey! That’s hydrogen in those 
bags!” 

“Oh, cripes.” But the biologist 
aimed carefully to one side of the 
flock. More and more of them were 
entering into the beam, now steady 
as Harriet had put it on the ground, 
pointing up, the whole diffuse 
swarm contracting into a knotted 
mass. 

When the flare went off the 
whole flock seemed to twitch like a 
single organism. They didn’t swarm 
toward it. They stayed bunched in 
an ellipsoidal huddle along the axis 
of the beam of light; but their song 
changed to reach a frantic cre- 
scendo, and there seemed to be a 



JEM 



57 




systematic rearranging of positions 
within the flock. The smaller and 
less brightly colored individuals 
bobbed toward the lower portions of 
the school, and the larger and 
gaudier ones lifted toward the top. 
Dalehouse stared in fascination, so 
entranced that he did not realize his 
face was sticky and wet until Kap- 
pelyushnikov grunted in surprise. 

“Hey! Is raining?” 

But it wasn’t rain. It was sweet 
and pungent on their lips, with an 
aftertaste that was animal and fetid; 
it fell like a gentle dew on their up- 
turned faces and clung to their 
skins. 

“Don’t swallow any!” cried 
Morrisssey, in belated panic. But it 
was too late for that. Some of the 
people were already licking their 
lips. Not that it mattered, thought 
Dalehouse, the stuff was all over 
them. If it was poisonous they were 
done for. 

“You fools!” cried Harriet, 
stamping her foot. She had never 
been attractive, and now she looked 
like a witch, sallow face in a 
grimace, uneven teeth bared. 
“We’ve got to get this stuff off. 
Kappelyushnikov, you and Morris- 
sey get buckets of water at once.” 

“Da, Gasha,” said the pilot 
dreamily. 

“Now!” she screamed. 

“Oh, of course, now.” He lum- 
bered off a few steps, then paused 
and looked coquettishly back over 
his shoulder. “Alyusha, dear. You 
help me get important water right 
away?” 

The navigator simpered. She an- 
swered him in Russian, something 
that made Kappelyushnikov grin 
and Harriet swear. “Don’t you 



clods know we’re all in danger?” 
she cried, catching at Dalehouse ’s 
hand imploringly. “You, Danny, 
you’ve always been nicer to me 
than those other bastards. Help me 
get water. ’ ’ 

He returned the pressure of her 
hand and whispered, “Hell, yes, 
honey, let’s get some water.” 

“Danny!” But she wasn’t angry 
any more. She was smiling, allow- 
ing him to tug her toward the lake- 
front. He ran his tongue over his lips 
again. Whatever the dew was, the 
more he tasted it the better he liked 
it: not sweet, not tart, not like fruit 
or meat, not like flowers. It was 
not like anything he had ever tasted 
before, but it was a taste he wanted 
more of. He saw Harriet touching 
her pointed tongue to her own thin 
lips, and was suddenly seized with 
the need to taste that Klongan mist 
from her mouth. He felt the damp 
heat rising inside him, and caught 
her roughly around the waist. 

They kissed desperately, their 
hands busy ripping each others’ 
clothes off. 

It never occured to them to think 
of hiding themselves. They cared 
nothing for what the others in the 
expedition might think of them, and 
the others cared no more for Harriet 
and Dalehouse. In couples and clus- 
ters the entire expedition was down 
on the ground in a mass fury of 
copulation, while overhead the 
swooping balloonists sang and 
soared through the searchlight and 
their gentle mist rained down on the 
human beings below.

1 WAS DIFFERENT, THEN. 

I remember collecting my separa- 
tion pay and taking the lighter down 
to Port City, leaving the ship in 
orbit behind me. It felt strange leav- 
ing the Titus Groan. She had been 
home for me for many years. But I 
wanted to live in a city again. I 
could afford to forget about space 
for a while. There would always be 
work for a paramed-rated phase- 
shift navigator. I wanted to raise 
some hell. 

And that I did. I immersed my- 
self in lusting, drinking and glori- 
ous, sweaty, knock-down brawling, 
ridding myself of all the stored 
energy accumulated over the years. 

Port City was accustomed to 
spacers running wild; it was an oc- 
cupational hazard. And there was 
profit to be made from it. I must 
have had a good time during that 
first month because I don’t re- 
member very much of it. One night 
I passed out in the middle of a 
filthy chanty somebody was sing- 
ing. 1 think it was me. 

1 awoke — perhaps revived would 
be a better word — to see the vague 
outlines of four people standing 
around me. My head was cradled in 
the lap of a fifth. A girl. Even in 
that condition, I could tell. She was 
trying to force some liquid into my 
mouth. I gagged, coughed, sput- 



tered and sprayed most of whatever 
it was all over her legs. 

“Look, it’s moving!’’ 

“Do you think it’s intelligent?’’ 
“Don’t be ridiculous. Would an 
intelligent being sing anything like 
thatT' 

“Yes, it was rather fascinating, 
wasn’t it? You think it will sing 
again if we buy it some more 
whisky?” 

“I think that if we buy it any 
more whisky, it’ll collapse.” 

I was trying to focus in on the 
faces — but I wasn’t having much 
luck. I tried to stand up but the 
room wouldn’t hold still. I fell flat 
on my face. My nose broke. 

“Oh, dear, he’s not going to die, 
is he? What a mess! Cilix, Irina, 
help him up. I won’t allow him to 
expire without finishing that song.” 
They lifted me onto a chair but 
my spine had turned to jelly. I felt 
the blood running down my face. I 
heard a loud thunk and realized it 
was the sound of my head hitting 
the table. I opened my eyes and 
saw the sympathy fir in its container 
begin to respond to me. As I 
watched it weave and sway drun- 
kenly, I began to feel nauseous. 

They had the bartender give me a 
small dose of adrenalin and after 
what seemed like several gallons of 
Terran coffee (I didn’t want to think 



THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



61 




of what it was costing me), I began 
to see straight again. 

My nose had been broken several 
times before and I was used to set- 
ting it myself. I slapped some plas- 
tic on the break in the skin and 
asked the serving unit to bring me 
some cigarettes. They were expen- 
sive but about three times stronger 
than anything I had ever smoked. 
Probably aatificial. 

My rescuers were young Bohe- 
mians. Artists. Jaded children with 
no goals or directions. I sang the 
song for them from start to finish 
but it took some explaining. It was 
an ancient Terran chanty concerning 
the amorous adventures of a sailor 
named Barnacle Bill. It wasn’t too 
difficult to translate the slang but I 
couldn’t remember what a barnacle 
was. I told them that it was prob- 
ably a part of an early reactor drive. 

Yuri listened to it all with a be- 
mused siiiile. She cultivated an 
ethereal air. A poet. She recited 
some of her work. It was terrible. 
Jil was a painter and, apparently, a 
successfuf one. She paid for the 
others. I liked her infectious, war- 
bling laugh and the way she joined 
in with me on the chorus. Cilix was a 
fallen academician of some sort. I 
couldn’t really tell what he was 
thinking, he didn’t talk much. But 
then again, I never could read 
Ophidians very well. Anthrus, on 
the other hand, spoke constantly. 
He considered himself a wit. I con- 
sidered him a cynic. But I wasn’t 
paying much attention to him. I 
couldn’t take my eyes off Irina. 

Irina was wonderful. Slim, tall 
and fair-skinned. She didn’t paint 
herself as most women did. Her 
skull was bare except for a tiny 



blossom tattooed on her cranium. 
Even her slightest movement was 
graceful. Irina knew she was beauti- 
ful and she wore it well. My feel- 
ings towards her weren’t lustful 
but . affectionate. I wanted to 
hold her, to stroke her cheek, to be 
gentle with her. I wanted to hear 
her sigh. I tried not to stare but I’m 
afraid it was a failed effort. 

As we spoke, the gentle flow of 
the sympathy fir dimmed slightly 
and then began to flicker. Patrons at 
surrounding tables, who had noticed 
similar reactions from their center- 
pieces, looked around to see what 
was disturbing the psychosensitive 
plants. Without glancing up from 
his wine, Anthrus smiled enigmati- 
cally and said, “John is here.’’ 

Irina tossed back her drink and 
announced that she was leaving but 
Anthrus held her by the arm and 
shook his head. She sat down 
again, uneasily. I glanced around at 
my companions, puzzled. Cilix, Jil 
and Yuri had all become suddenly 
glum. Anthrus pursed his lips and 
fixed me with his ice-blue stare. 

“When John enters a room,’’ he 
said, “one gets the feeling some- 
body just left.’’ 

I noticed that several people in 
our immediate vicinity were, in 
fact, leaving. Our little group was 
rapidly becoming an island. It was 
only then that I saw John. He ap- 
peared at Anthrus’ left shoulder. 
Our plant shivered and its halo all 
but disappeared. 

He was tall. The shabby surplice 
covered a uniform that was familiar 
but I couldn’t place it. The gaunt 
and craggy features had an almost 
gray pallor and his hair was long 
and stringy. But the eyes were the 



62 



GALAXY 




most striking thing about him. Va- 
cant. Totally devoid of any expres- 
sion, of any life. 

“John, how nice to see you.” 
Anthnis beckoned him to a chair. 
“Sit down and join us. Wine?” 

“No, thank you,” the spectre an- 
swered in a voice as tired and 
empty as a derelict of space. He sat 
down and I stared as the fir quite 
literally strained away from him. 

Outside of the fact that John was 
as lost a looking soul as I had ever 
seen, 1 could not understand what it 
was about the man that seemed to 
cause everyone such concern. He 
did not strike me as a particularly 
disturbing individual — but the firs 
knew better. Every one of the sensi- 
tive plants within several meters of 
us was flickering like mad and our 
own fir was behaving as though it 
had the botanical equivalent of St. 
Vitus’s dance. 

The manager of the bistro ap- 
proached our table, his hands 
clenched in massive fists. 

“I have made it known to you,” 
he said in his heavily accented En- 
glish, “that I do not wish your 
presence here. You disturb the 
business, John.” 

“You have no right to bar this 
man from the premises,” countered 
Anthrus. “He’s done nothing 
wrong. He has not broken any 
laws.” 

“I have no right,” agreed the 
manager. “You can report me if 
you wish.” 

“I shall.” 

“Nevertheless, he must leave at 
once.” 

Throughout the exchange John sat 
motionless as though completely 
unaware of what was going on 



around him. 

“If he leaves, then we all leave 
with him,” Anthrus declared. 

Of course we all left. Having noth- 
ing else to do, I went with them. 
The others had grown silent. The 
talkative Jil had become a sudden 
introvert. Cilix and Yuri both 
looked straight ahead as they 
walked and Irina looked upset. In 
an effort to break the awkward si- 
lence, I asked John if he was 
thrown out often. 

He answered simply, “Yes.” 
“But . why?” 

He replied, “I have a surrogate,” 
and then abruptly walked away. 

* -k * 

“I don’t like him,” Irina said, 
lounging with her shoes off. 

“Oh, I don’t know. I find his 
company stimulating.” Anthrus 
grinned at her. “Don’t you?” 

She snorted derisively and went 
back to doing nothing. She did it 
very gracefully. 

“Who is he?” 1 asked. 

Cilix paused in his preparation of 
the yola leaves. 

“He was a merchant spacer, like 
yourself A mercenary, wasn’t he?” 
“Ask Anthrus,” Yuri replied as 
she carefully applied paint to her 
depilated cranium. “He’s our expert 
on the walking dead.” 

“The walking dead?” 

“Yuri is being true to her melo- 
dramatic Russian heritage,” smiled 
Anthrus. “Yes, John was a merce- 
nary, 1 suppose. I can’t think who 
else of Terran origin would want to 
crew for the Lhari.” 

That was where I had seen the 
uniform. “What happened to him?” 



THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



63 




“He picked up a habit,” an- 
swered Cilix, setting down the bowl 
of husked yola leaves. 

“Is that what he meant when he 
said he had a surrogate?” I chose a 
leaf from the bowl and popped it in 
my mouth, feeling the delicious 
coolness as* it melted. Anthrus 
looked surprised. 

“You mean that in all your 
travels you never heard of the sur- 
rogate lizard? That so-called legen- 
dary creature?” 

I had to admit ignorance. 

“Ah!” Anthrus leaned forward, 
pleased with his captive audience. 
“I enjoy telling this story!” 

“Be kind for once,” Yuri said 
dryly. “Make it short.” 

“Oh, very well.” Anthrus made 
a mock bow in her direction. “I 
shall be merciful. Short and to the 
point.” He turned to me. “You’ve 
heard of a planet named Xerxes V, 
in the Julianas?” 

I had. “A quarantined world.” 
Anthrus shrugged. “Why should 
that concern the Lhari? Their crews 
are expendable.” 

I nodded grimly. With their high 
pay came high risk. 

“So,” continued Anthrus, “one 
of John’s shipmates was bitten by a 
surrogate while there. It came 
aboard with him, that is, he smug- 
gled it in. It is a curious sort of rep- 
tile, births just like a mammal. It’s 
quite remarkable. Well, to be brief, 
this lizard was pregnant. Its off- 
spring crawled into John ’s berth one 
night and became his personal para- 
site.” 

“Parasite? When Cilix said he 
had a habit, I naturally assumed 
some sort of narcotic or — ” 

“But the surrogate is a habit! A 



deadly one.” Anthrus’ eyes glit- 
tered with a positively necrophilic 
delight. “It has a narcotic effect 
upon its host. Once bitten by a sur- 
rogate, you’re doomed. You simply 
cannot live without it. Its secretions 
are addictive. Eventually the host 
dies. How soon depends mainly 
upon the host’s constitution and the 
lizard’s appetite. John and his sur- 
rogate seem to have developed a 
rather successful symbiotic relation- 
ship. He’s been lingering for years. 
His fs a pragmatic parasite. It 
knows John’s biological limitations 
very well.” 

“It knows?” 

“Oh, yes, it knows] The surro- 
gate is sentient. It possesses an in- 
tellect of a very high order. The 
species, as I understand it, is quite 
rare and indigenous only to Xerxes. 
Most people think its existence is a 
myth.” He grinned wolfishly. “My 
friends, we simply must have 
another demonstration!” 

Amidst their moans and cries of 
protest, he turned to me and said, 
“This will be an experience you 
shall remember.” 

★ * * 

“Pay the man.” 

“Anthrus, no!” Irina showed a 
sudden concern. “Don’t do this to 
him. Please.” 

“Why should I pay him?” 

Anthrus smiled, again that enig- 
matic rictus. “He will tell you 
about yourself.” 

Yuri took my hand, pressing it 
earnestly. “Don’t do it. Don’t listen 
to him.” 

But Anthrus knew I would My 
curiosity was hooked. I paid John

while Yuri cleared the table, keep- 
ing her eyes averted from our guest. 
Once again a pall had fallen on my 
friends. Once again Irina tried to 
leave and Anthrus prevented it. I 
was beginning to resent his domina- 
tion of her. Cilix rose to dim the 
lights. 

“Oh, no, no, Cilix! Bring a fir,” 
said Anthrus gleefully. “This must 
be a complete experience.” 

His thin lips compressed, Cilix 
placed a fir upon the table. Im- 
mediately it began to tremble and 
its glow began to wane. Anthrus 
beckoned and we formed a circle, 
seated around the table. 

“Shall I begin?” 

Anthrus looked to me to answer 
John. 1 nodded. 

Slowly John removed his outer 
surplice. Beneath it, clinging to his 
shabby Lhari uniform — the surro- 
gate. 

It was approximately fifteen cen- 
timeters long — and bright, bright 
yellow. My initial impression was 
that it resembled a salamander but 
the head was too big for that. Its 
eyes were closed and it appeared to 
be asleep. With two fingers of his 
left hand John gently stroked it. The 
lizard moved. 

The creature detached itself from 
John’s tunic and crawled down onto 
the surface of the table. There was 
something repulsive about its 
movements. Yuri swallowed ner- 
vously. She looked frightened. Jil’s 
expression was one of horror. Irina 
looked disgusted. And Anthrus — 

But the lizard! Slowly its head 
turned in my direction and it looked 
at me. There was nothing reptilian 
in those eyes. On a small scale they 
were almost human in appearance. 



Blue. Set deep in that pyramid- 
shaped head. And it was looking at 
me! 

Them, with blinding speed, it 
leaped up on John’s exposed right 
forearm, sinking its claws deep into 
the flesh. John winced. Again those 
blue eyes looked at me just before 
the jaws gajjed open. Two irides- 
cent, sn^e-like fangs. Slowly, 
hideously, like a lover, the lizard 
sank those tesselated nightmares 
into the soft flesh just below John’s 
bicep. 

Irina gagged and shut her eyes. 
The others watched in frozen fasci- 
nation. 

The hypersensitive fir had torn it- 
self from its container by the roots. 
It lay thrashing on the table, its 
glow extinguished, dying. 

John’s eyes were closed in 
ecstasy. A tiny tear of blood welled 
in the comer of his mouth where he 
had bitten through his lip. He 
shivered — shook — and then was 
still. The lizard sucked, immobile. 

A gradual change came over 
John. He sighed deeply. His skin 
was flushed, his forehead damp 
with beads of perspiration. The 
ashen gray of his complexion faded 
away and in its place a robust glow 
of health shone forth. He opened 
his eyes, flashed a stunning smile 
and winked. Then, taking his dis- 
carded surplice, he draped it over 
his arm, hiding the lizard from 
view. 

“It disturbs some people to have 
to look at it,” he explained in a 
voice totally different from the one 
I had heard him use before. He 
raised a glass of wine and toasted 
us. We drank — he with gusto, the 
rest of us with trepidation. He

looked at Anthrus with a dazzling 
smile. 

“Well, my predatory friend,’’ he 
said, “another night of voyeurism 
for you as my brother spacer turns 
slowly on the spit.” He winked at 
me. “You will get your money’s 
worth tonight, I promise you.” 

“All rignt. So you’re a gypsy, 
then? What can you tell me of my- 
self?” I asked him. 

He chuckled. “Only everything.” 
Again that brilliant smile, disarming 
and sincere. “You’re certain that 
you want to know?” 

I nodded, skeptical. I had known 
gypsies in my time, although none 
whose act was quite so spectacular. 
He was a showman, that I had to 
grant him. 

“You’re wrong,” he laughed. 
“I’m not an actor and this is not a 
farce.” 

I was impressed. “Not bad. 
Telepathy? Or simple ESP?” I 
couldn’t keep from smirking but he 
didn’t seem to notice. 

“Mm, yes, I suppose you could 
say that. And, also, no. Let’s just 
say I have a way of sensing the 
truth.” 

Anthrus was watching us intently. 

“Indeed?” I asked. “And just 
what is the truth?” 

He cocked an eyebrow at me. 
“Well, there are more truths than 
you know. For example, your feel- 
ings toward Irina.” 

I felt a sudden tightness in my 
stomach. My eyes met hers and saw 
surprise. She did not look away. 

“^‘And she, of course, is flattered 
by this bit of information,” John 
continued. “Because, you see, Irina 
has a hunger for much more than 
our friend Anthrus, here, can give 



her. She’s thought about you once 
or twice. She’s thinking about you 
now. About what you look like sans 
your clothing. Shall I tell her?” 

1 think I blushed. Anthrus threw 
back his head and laughed. 

“Don’t let his laughter fool 
you,” John warned, looking at me 
seriously. “He really doesn’t like 
you, you know.” 

“That’s right, I don’t.” Anthrus 
had a strange look on his face. “I 
don’t like you at all. But then, I 
don’t like anyone. John’s told me 
that before. I have too strong a 
sense of self. The ideal hedonist 
devotes himself full time to his own 
ego. But our Irina, well, she de- 
votes herself to passion, don’t you, 
my love?” She was lool^ing at me, 
not at Anthrus. “So you like our 
new friend?” he went on. “Well, 
go on, enjoy him. He’s relatively 
young and twice as strong as I, no 
doubt. Go on. But I shall hate you 
for it. Perhaps you’ll let me 
watch?” 

“That wasn’t funny, Anthrus,” I 
snapped. 

“It wasn’t meant to be. You see, 
we have to tell the truth tonight. 
Otherwise John will catch us in our 
dissembling. Because he knows the 
truth. And John is never, ever, 
wrong.” 

“He’s right,” John said. “I 
never am. And that explains your 
earlier confusion as to why I’m so 
universally disliked. It isn’t that I 
am, as you so aptly pictured me, as 
lost a looking soul as you have ever 
seen. Most people find tragic losers 
reassuring in a way. They feel 
superior in seeing someone worse 
off than they themselves. The sim- 
ple fact is that no one, no life form 



66 



GALAXY 




as I know it, can bear to hear the 
unadulterated truth about itself. The 
truth is too disconcerting. It strips 
away pretensions and defenses. No- 
body really wants to hear the truth 
when lies are so much more attrac- 
tive.” 

“And the truth about yourself?” 
I asked. 

“You did not pay for that.” 

“I’ll pay you now.” 

“I’m not that hungry. Besides, 
tonight is yours. I have much more 
to tell.” 

And so it went. A brutal session 
of unspeakable encounter. He 
laughed, he smiled, he charmed. He 
told me things about myself that 
were so deeply buried that my con- 
scious mind had never thought to 
resurrect them. 

And, finally, there was a stirring 
beneath the surplice. The lizard 
crawled back up John’s arm and 
took its place upon his chest. It shut 
his eyes and moved no more. The 
surrogate — sated — slept . 

And as I sat there, stunned, the 
man’s effervescence faded. The 
spark diminished in his eyes until 
once again they glazed over. His 
skin resumed its ghastly pallor. The 
life was gone, the shell remained. 
With a tired, hollow voice, the 
spacer thanked us. Then he stum- 
bled through the portal and was 
gone. 

I said, “I think I’d like to kill 
him.” 

Anthrus chuckled. “But you 
can’t. He’s too compelling. Who 
among us, after all, can kill the 
truth?” 

Yuri sighed wearily. “And you 
said / was melodramatic?” 

I found it difficult to look at 




Irina, sitting with Anthrus’ grace- 
fully clawed hand covering her 
own. I was not normally given to 
prejudice but, watching them, I felt 
more strongly than ever that the 
Terran girl belonged with me, with 
one of her own. 

“I certainly wish I had psi pow- 
ers as effective as his,” I said, try- 
ing to keep the irony out of my 
voice. 

Cilix thoughtfully stroked the 
stem of his goblet. 

“You still don’t understand, do 
you?” He was regarding me with 
that unblinking Ophidian stare. 
“John has no psi powers. He is not 
an empath or a gypsy or even a 
very perceptive human being. John 
is a pitiable derelict. That is all he 
is and that is all he ever shall be.” 

“But, then, how — ” 

“The surrogate,” answered Yuri.

THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



“It speaks through John. The lizard 
has no vocal chords of its own, nor 
does it have any kind of telepathic 
ability. As John says, he — it — 
senses the truth. And it uses its host 
as a means to communicate.” 

“You look startled,” Anthrus 
grinned. “I told you that the lizard 
possessed an intellect of a very high 
order. I wonder if we can persuade 
John to allow himself to be scanned 
next time? Wouldn’t it be amusing 
if it turned out that the surrogate’s 
intelligence was superior to any of 
ours? Small wonder Xerxes V was 
placed under quarantine!” 

“I feel sorry for him,” Jil said 
softly. Her voice had a meek and 
gentle quality. She seemed to speak 
more to herself than to the others. 
“1 wish there was something we 
could do to help him.” 

“Your sympathy for him is very 
touching,” said Anthrus flatly, “but 
to interfere would only cause you 
grief. Nothing can be done. He is 
an undesirable. Where can he go? 
What can he do? John really lives 
only when those fangs are in his 
veins. Tonight he shone and glit- 
tered; he radiated truth and bril- 
liance and provided us with much 
amusement — ” 

“Speak for yourself,” interjected 
Yuri. 

“ — and for all we know, he’s bet- 
ter off that way. We’ve seen what 
he is like in normal circumstances. 
Won’t eat more than is necessary to 
barely stay alive, won’t drink, 
won’t laugh, won’t even cry as hu- 
mans do so often. .” 

I saw Irina wince. 

”... why, without the lizard, he 
would die. He told me so himself. 
His apathy may be his normal state. 



After crewing for the Lhari, I 
shouldn’t be surprised if that were 
so. And if that’s the case, well, 
then the lizard saves him. And you 
must admit,” he looked at me and 
smiled maliciously, “John has be- 
come a fascinating creature. Now, 
thanks to him, we know all your 
inner thoughts and secrets.” 

I watched him as he smirked and 
gloated over how he had maneu- 
vered me to be hoisted on my own 
petard. 

“I must admit I am surprised, 
though,” he continued. “I know 
you hated what you heard tonight. I 
know it must have hurt you deeply. 
And yet, you’re unashamed. How is 
that possible? I was under the im- 
pression that I knew human na- 
ture.” 

He turned his strangely beautiful 
face to Irina and chucked her chin 
gently with his fragile fingers, hav- 
ing sheathed his claws. 

“We must talk about this tonight, 
Irina. We really must discuss our 
new friend here. Why is he un- 
ashamed? Your reactions were 
rather different, as I recall.” 

* * * 

I sought solace in the quiet, 
moonless night. Standing naked on 
the balcony, I felt the warm north- 
ern breezes on my skin and I 
breathed in deep lungfuls of the 
humid air. 

The others slept. I was thinking 
while looking at one of Jil’s paint- 
ings, not yet finished, resting on its 
metal stand and glistening in the 
soft light. I turned down the illumi- 
nation on the balcony so I could see 
the painting’s luminescent glow. It 



68

was the face of John. The eyes in 
the painting were sad, unlike the 
glazed and lifeless ones of the 
model. 

“I wonder if you feel anything at 
all?” I murmured to the painting. 
“What’s it like, being used as a 
surrogate mouth by the very being 
that destroys you? What do you feel 
when you look into someone else’s 
soul?” 

“I often wonder about that my- 
self,” said Jil. She sat behind me, 
in the shadows. She had been so 
still, I had not noticed her. I stared 
at the red fire of her eyes, two 
glowing dots that floated up as she 
rose and came toward me. 

“This one will sell,” I gestured 
at the painting. “To a stranger who 
hasn’t met the original. It’s the 
eyes. The sort of look one sees in 
poets’ eyes, 1 suppose.” 

“I don’t think that I will sell it,” 
she said. She, too, had undressed to 
enjoy the evening breeze. Her fur 
rippled in the gentle wind. “This 
painting gives me. .” she hesi- 
tated. “There’s not a word for it in 
English.” She made a sound no 
human throat could copy. “It’s just 
one word and yet it means so many 
things. I really can’t explain.” 

“It’s all right. I think I under- 
stand.” 

Then I became aware that I was 
speaking to a different Jil. This Jil 
was very serious. 

“You’re not yourself tonight,” I 
said. 

“At home, in our society, we 
wear two faces,” she explained. 
“One we present from day to day 
to those around us in order to ac- 
commodate their actions. The other 
is for family and friends — the pri- 



vate face.” She pointed to the 
chamber shared by Anthrus and 
Irina. “You want a lover but you 
need a friend.” 

Before I could reply, she placed 
two fingers on my lips and held 
them there. 

“You shouldn’t sleep tonight,” 
she said. “Stay here. Watch the 
night and think about the things the 
surrogate told you. Few people re- 
ally know themselves. Confronted 
with such knowledge all at once, 
it’s easy to deny the truth. It’s sim- 
ple not to face it. That’s why John 
is hated. But he’s really blameless. 
You should not hate a man for 
things said by a voice that he can- 
not control.” 

She left me then so that I could 
be alone. I felt the need to walk. 1 
dressed quietly so as not to wake 
the others. 

* * * 

Port City never slept. It had too 
many diverse life forms to accom- 
modate. There were five “stan- 
dard” languages spoken and the 
city was subdivided into a variety of 
environments. Anyone who did not 
fit in had to adapt as best he could 
but there were even facilities to help 
accomplish that, provided one could 
pay. 

It was an exciting city — the new 
Rome to which all space routes led. 
But like the original Rome of 
primordial times, this Rome had its 
share of decadence and desolation. I 
had been attracted by the deca- 
dence. What I found instead was 
something else entirely. 

“Where are we going?” 

Irina! 



THE SURROGATE MOUTH

“I thought you were asleep,” I 
told her. ‘Tm sorry if I woke 
you.” 

“I’m a light sleeper. Not like An- 
thrus.” 

“Why did you follow me?” 

“Can’t .you guess?” She linked 
her arm with mine as we walked. 
“Don’t tell me we need John here 
to tell us all about each other.” 
There was an unpleasant edge to her 
voice. 

“You’re beginning to sound like 
Anthrus,” 

“Must we talk about him?” 

“Why not? The three of us don’t 
have any secrets from each other 
any more, do. we? The surrogate 
saw to that.” 

“He disgusts me!” I was sur- 
prised at her vehemence. “How 
anyone can allow himself to fall to 
such a state. ...” 

As she spoke, I suddenly realized 
that this was the first time we had 
been alone since they had picked 
me up off the bistro floor. I should 
have been taking advantage of the 
opportunity, but I wasn’t. I kept 
thinking about what Jil had said. 
We walked a while in silence. 
Awkward silence. Irina was the first 
to break it. 

“What’s the matter? Don’t you 
want me any more?” 

I never thought I’d have to think 
before I answered such a question. 
“I . I’m not sure. I suppose 
so.” 

“You suppose sol That’s a fine 
thing to say to a girl who offers you 
herself! I could be wrong but do I 
detect a certain lack of en- 
thusiasm?” 

“I’m just confused. I thought I 
knew myself inside and out. Oh, I 

70 



knew I had a lot of shortcomings 
but—” 

“Are you still thinking about 
John? Forget him. He’s just a bum. 
He isn’t important, you and I are. 
You shouldn’t let him get to you.” 
“He seems to get to you, though. 
Anthrus must have arranged for the 
two of you to meet with John be- 
fore, didn’t he? A private session, 
just the three of you?” 

I felt her arm tighten. 

“No.” 

“No?” 

“Not just the three of us.” 

Of course. The others would have 
been present, too. Anthrus would 
have seen to that. It also explained 
his earlier statements about the 
human capacity for shame. The ex- 
perience had been a painful one for 
me. For Irina, it must have been 
truly humiliating. 

“Why do you let him treat you 
that way?” I asked her. “Why do 
you stay with him? You aren’t a 
masochist, are you?” 

“You don’t have to be insult- 
ing,” she bristled. “If you don’t 
want me, simply say so.” 

“Would you return to Anthrus?” 
“Yes.” 

“Then I can’t think of a single 
good reason why I should want 
you.” 

“Svolotch!” she swore at me in 
Russian. Her hands darted up to my 
face and I felt a sharp stab of pain 
as the long nails clawed. There was 
a sudden stickiness just above my 
left eye. She may have meant to 
blind me in her spite but I had al- 
ready seen enough. I turned and left 
her standing there.

The juice of the berries from the 
harlequin bush, unfermented, is a 
deadly poison. But when pressed 
and processed into wine, the berries 
have an anesthetic quality. I was 
feeling no pain. 

1 had wandered into the sanguine, 
sealed section of the city that had 
been set aside for the Frilissi, 
whose auditory membranes are so 
sensitive that theirs is, to humans, a 
virtually mute culture. What I per- 
ceived as silence was comforting to 
me. I had wanted to go someplace 
where 1 could be alone — nowhere is 
one so alone as in a crowd of total 
strangers. 

I rubbed my thumb and forefinger 
together softly and an attendant ap- 
peared at my side. In his own lan- 
guage 1 subvocalized my request for 
more wine. He was pleased to see 
the pains I took not to let the 
slightest whisper escape my lips and 
he did his best to imitate a human 
smile, althouth it must have been 
uncomfortable for him. To a 
Frilissi, the baring of teeth is an 
offensive act. I thanked him for the 
compliment he paid me. Then sud- 
denly he started. 

The thick fibrafoam flooring had 
prevented my hearing any footsteps 
but someone had actually ap- 
proached so silently that not even 
my attendant had been aware. It un- 
settled him greatly. Only one race 
of beings known to man can move 
so quietly when they want to, and 
we have no name for them. We 
cannot speak their language and so 
we call them by the adjective which 
most closely describes their 
appearance — feline. 

Jil sat down and waited quietly 
until I had finished my wine. She 



did not know how , to subvocalize 
and we could not otherwise com- 
municate without causing severe 
pain to the Frilissi. Consequently 
we merely sat and watched each 
other. It felt nice. 

I needed the wine to deaden my 
emotions so I could think clearly. 1 
thought about how much Anthrus, 
Irina and I had in common. Like 
the surrogate, we were manip- 
ulators. Users. Small wonder Irina 
hated John so much. Acknowledg- 
ihg the ultimate victim must have 
been unpleasant for her. It had been 
for me. Hate was a convenient sur- 
rogate for guilt. 

1 couldn’t remain in the Frilissi 
zone for long. Although 1 wasn’t 
able to hear it, the ultra high- 
frequency pitch of their conversa- 
tion was giving me a migraine. 1 
paid my tab and we left. The sky 
looked like rain. 

“You tracked me,” 1 accused Jil 
then. “Why?” 

She was embarrassed. She had to 
have smelled my clothes in order to 
be able to pick up my scent and 
since 1 had only the clothes on my 
back, she must have scented them 
in my room right after she left me 
on the balcony. She must have sus- 
pected that I would leave. But why 
should that fact have concerned her? 

“You weren’t going to come 
back, were you?” she countered my 
question. 

“No,” 1 said. “But you haven’t 
answered me. What made you think 
I was going to leave? And why did 
you track me?” 

It started raining. Jil turned as 
though to look for shelter but 1 
grabbed her by the shoulders. She 
did not resist. We looked at each 



THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



71 




other for a long moment. 

“Jil . I’m just some guy you 
picked up off the floor.” 

She looked down. The rain was 
matting her fur. She brushed at it 
absently. She looked like a drowned 
cat and I felt a giggle starting in my 
throat. 

“I’m going to smell funny,” she 
said. 

I burst out laughing. She looked 
up in surprise and then she started 
laughing too. Our eyes met again 
and suddenly I wanted very much to 
kiss her . and I did. 

“Do you want to go back?” I 
asked. 

She shook her head. “I want to 
go with you.” 

“But your paintings?” 

“I want only the one.” 1 knew 
which one. “I can get it later. 
There’s a hostel not far from here. 
Let’s get a room.” 

I have been in rooms with 
females of all races, yet 1 was sur- 
prised to find myself feeling exhila- 
rated and excited, as though 1 were 
about to have a new experience. 
But then, that is exactly what it 
was — a brand new experience. I had 
never gone to bed with a friend be- 
fore. It felt happy. 

Giggling like children, we ran 
through the downpour, dodging 
shuttlecraft and turbines, splashing 
in the puddles. 1 tripped and fell 
sprawling. We both were com- 
pletely soaked and 1 could not re- 
member when 1 had laughed so 
hard. Then, as I was getting up, 1 
saw what I had tripped over. 

It was John. 

He way lying on his back in the 
street, his eyes wide open. He was 
dead. 



Jil made a little mewling noise 
and looked away. I knelt over his 
body, brushing the straggly hair out 
of his face. His neck was broken 
and obviously he had been lying 
there for some time. I was brought 
back to reality. Someone had killed 
him. No one would ever know why 
and no one would ever care. Just 
another night in Port City. 

Jil screamed then. Too late, I 
noticed that his surplice had been 
blown back by the wind and that 
the lizard wasn’t there. It was 
climbing rapidly up my leg. I tried 
to beat it off but it was too fast for 
me. 

I saw Jil run toward me and I 
yelled at her to stay back. And then 
I felt excruciating pain. 1 sank to 
my knees, tearing at the creature, 
but it would not let go. I screamed, 
half with pain, half with fear. Sear- 
ing heat flowed through me. I felt 
dizzy. Weak. I heard Jil call my 
name. I could feel her hands touch 
me, trying to pry the creature loose, 
but she sounded far away. I could 
feel myself sweating. Warm. It was 
so warml So relaxing and pleasant. 

Let me go, Jil. Leave me alone, 
it feels good. 1 pushed her away 
roughly. I hadn’t wanted to do that 
but it didn’t matter. Nothing mat- 
tered. Don’t cry, Jil, please. 

She doesn’t understand . 

How can I explain? It really 
doesn’t hurt so much, it. 

You can't explain. She’ll never 
understand. She doesn’t want to. 
Forget her. 

No. 

I felt like I was coated with warm 
vaseline. My skin had a consistency 
I never before realized. What a 
wonderful thing, my skin! Funny

how I never noticed it before. The 
way the tiny little hairs on the back 
of my hand resemble a wheat 
field. 

And there’s an area where the 
thumb and forefinger join in that lit- 
tle webbed part between the 
fingers — I could see a vein throb- 
bing. Tiny, miniature eruptions of 
blood coursing through there, just 
below the skin . pump. Pump. 
Pump. Pump. Pump. Pump. 

My head seemed to be moving. 
Really wish it would stop, most dis- 
tracting . Jil? Is that youl I 
couldn’t seem to focus my vision. 
What? » Why . she was slapping 
my face. Stupid thing to do. 

Make her stop ! 

Right. Make her stop. Was it 
raining? Somehow I seem to re- 
member rain. Strange. The sun was 
shining. 

Variegated fields of indigo and 
scarlet, sanguine skies besmirched 
with gridelin and glowing golden 
birds. 

Beautiful, isn’t itl 

Mmmmmrnmm. 

There was a village. Primitive. 
And people toiling in the gardens 
by their homes. Bandy-legged 
people with protruding eyes and 
gawky elbows. Frog-like. Docile. 
Calm. Serene. And each one with a 
lizard clinging. 

No, wait! 

It was gone. I wanted to see 
more. The rain was trickling down 
my face, comingling with the 
sweat. The street was empty. I 
could hear traffic in the distance. 
Traffic and the dripping, plopping 
sound of rain. 1 was prostrate in a 
puddle. My vision cleared and I 
could see my predecessor, decaying

in the damp. Poor John. And now 
poor me. 

With a sloshing 1 raised myself to 
hands and knees and tried to gulp 
some air into my lungs. My head 
was hanging down. Dear God, it 
was so heavy, it was all that I could 
do to lift it. I did. And I saw Jil. 

She was lying on her side, a 
stream of stark vermilion coloring 
the pavement by her face. Her lips 
were gashed, her pointy teeth were 
chipped . and the knuckles on 
my hand were cut and swollen. 

It was clinging to my shoulder. 
Watching me. I began to heave. 

My stomach kept contracting and 
1 was racked with shivers. 1 crawled 
over to Jil, lying there bleeding in 
the rain. She wasn’t badly hurt but 1 
had knocked her senseless. In a fury 
I snatched for the thing that was 
clinging to my arm now. 1 felt the 
lizard’s fangs, two heated razors 
slicing deep. Again I screamed. 1 
never knew so many feelings in 
such a short span of time: frustra- 
tion, hatred, helplessness and pity, 
rage and ecstasy, futility and fear 
and sweet, serene contentment. 

And somewhere between the 
dreaming and the reality, I think, 
perhaps, I cried. 

* * * 

The bed was soaked with sweat. 
And there was an odor. It was not 
pleasant. It was coming from me. 
My eyes felt like rusty hinges as I 
tried to open them. I heard a famil- 
iar voice say, “Look, it’s moving.’’ 

Deja vu. Anthrus’s smirking face 
floated into focus. I shut my eyes. 

“Strange how ironic life can be, 
isn’t it?’’ 



There was the sound of a slap 
and a yelp of pain. I opened my 
eyes again to see Anthrus clutching 
the side of his head. Jil was stand- 
ing with her back to me, her arm 
raised to strike again. There was a 
flicking noise as Anthrus showed 
his claws. And then Cilix was be- 
tween them, urging, “Don’t.” 

I watched them with detachment. 
Jil turned to face me. She did not 
look pretty. I had done more dam- 
age than I thought. 

“How do you feel?” she asked. 

My mouth moved of its own ac- 
cord. It said, “Weak.” 

Cilix had shepherded Anthrus out 
of the room. Jil and I were alone. 
No. We weren’t. It was with us. 

“Sorry,” 1 mumbled. But I 
wasn’t. 

She shrugged. It was a human 
gesture. Yet she made it look natu- 
ral, somehow. 

“I tried to . .” She looked 
away. 

“I tried to ... to take that 
thing away while you were sleep- 
ing. .” 

It was resting on my chest, 
quiescent. 

“. but you wouldn’t let me.” 

I stared at her. I heard what she 
was saying but it didn’t seem im- 
portant. 

She sighed deeply. “Every time 1 
came near, it ... it would do 
something, 1 don’t know 
what ... or how. You wouldn’t let 
us near you.” 

I had beaten Cilix. Also Yuri. 
She was with Irina, crying. And I 
had hurt Jil. Again. So? So Anthrus 
was right. Life can be ironic. I had 
come full circle. Wasn’t this where 
I came in?

“Stop it! Stop it!” Jil half 
screamed, half sobbed. 

Why? What was ... I had begun 
to absently stroke the lizard with 
two fingers of my left hand. The 
creature turned and watched her. 
And then it looked at me. Its gaze 
was direct. Comforting. 

Cilix burst into the room as the 
lizard began crawling slowly, lazily, 
up my chest. I was dimly aware of 
Jil, straining against Cilix’s grasp. 
She was hysterical. I wasn’t paying 
much attention to them. I wished 
that ii would hurry. 

The sounds of sobbing and 
screaming were fading. I felt the 
heat and shut my eyes. It was so 
wonderful and all I had to do was 
to simply lie there. The pain was 
part of it. The burning and the 
soreness ... I’d come to know the 
soreness well. My arms inflamed 
from all its bites, my neck a mass 
of scar tissue from its feasting at 
my jugular, my skin broken into 
eczema and itching, 1 lived a sca- 
brous existence in a semi-darkened 
room. 

I heard its voice, I knew its truth, 
I saw its visions. I lived the story of 
the quarantine. I heard the voices 
from the past. The saga of the 
Zharii — the froggish, gangly people 
with the penetrating eyes. 

“What do you mean they’re not 
intelligent? Are you insane? Their 
level of — ” 

“I’m telling you, sir, they are not 
intelligent \ There is no sentience. 
We’ve been communicating with 
the lizards.” 

And that was the beginning. It 
was then that they began the perse- 
cution. 

But you were killing them. 



We were controlling them. 

Voices. Distant voices. 

“It’s the ecology. The Zharii 
breed like rabbits. The lizards are 
their predators.” 

“Good Lord!” 

“We may be able to teach them 
zero population growth, or some- 
thing. I don’t know how it will 
work. ...” 

They tried. It cost them dearly. 

Yes. It had indeed. The Terrans 
had deprived some of the lizards of 
their Zharih mounts. The results 
were catastrophic. I saw tom and 
bleeding bodies. Or what was left 
of bodies. Shredded human flesh, 
still-pulsating organs tom from 
dying men. Leaping maniacs with 
salivating mouths and fiendish, 
groping fingers ... I couldn’t beat 
them off! 1 couldn’t . couldn’t 

Something grabbed me. Some- 
one. Cilix. Jil was lying on the 
floor, a beaten mess. And there was 
Yuri. And Irina. Yuri kneeling by 
Jil’s side, Irina with a kinjhal. 

“Sookin sin\ I’ll carve the bas- 
tard!” She lunged and Yuri caught 
her arm. 

“Let her,” Anthrus said. “She’s 
nursed a hate for him ever since he 
turned her down. Go on. Put the 
poor fool out of his misery.” 

“No. .” Jil moaned faintly 
from the floor. “No, please! It’s 
not his fault. He didn’t mean it. I’m 
all right. ...” 

I could see into the depths of all 
their souls. Irina had it in her mind 
to kill me. If not now, then later. 
Anthms felt himself a cuckold, in 
spirit if not in fact. Irina’s lust for 
murder evoked in him a sexual ex- 
citement. Yuri was both disgusted 



THE SURROGATE MOUTH

and afraid, but she also felt pity. 
Cilix thought of me as a disease 
without a cure and he wondered 
how best to isolate me. And 
Jil. 

Jil loved me. 1 knew it as an ir- 
revocable truth. And 1 had the an- 
swer to a question 1 had once asked 
a painting: When you look into 
someone else’s soul, you feel de- 
spair. 

* * ★ 

The walls were bare. The light 
was minimal. The bed was hard. 
The floor was cold. Jil and 1 were 
hiding. Part of myself wanted her to 
leave and another part wanted her to 
stay. So I did nothing. I didn’t 
know what I wanted. 

Irina had known she couldn’t kill 
me. The surrogate would sense it 
first. So, faced with an opponent 
who would know her every move in 
advance, she had made the most 
logical one. The authorities in Port 
City don’t take kindly to spacers 
wandering about with dangerous life 
forms, carrying deadly infections. 
The lizard qualified as both. As she 
had repiorted us, we had fled. 

They wouldn’t look too hard for 
me. As long as there was no real 
danger of a spreading of infection, 
they would be content to look the 
other way, as they had done with 
John. At best it was a clear-cut case 
of violation of quarantine. But Irina 
had made a formal complaint. The 
police would have to m^e at least 
a token effort to arrest me. 

Because of me, Jil too was tech- 
nically a fugitive. She had sold the 
remainder of her paintings. Except 
the one. It was propped up in the 



comer where she slept now, curled 
up like a wounded kitten. She 
sometimes stared at it for hours. 

I didn’t know which of us looked 
the worst. Poor Jil was emaciated, 
bruised and battered. And 1 was 
afraid to look into a mirror. I didn’t 
want to know. 

It seemed that I could not control 
my rages. The surrogate wanted to 
be rid of Jil. In my more lucid mo- 
ments I screamed, I cried, I pleaded 
With her to leave me. But she re- 
fused. The surrogate and I both 
knew that it was useless. So 1 sank 
back into an apathetic daze. 

From time to time Cilix and Yuri 
would stop by to bring us food. 
Yuri would sit with Jil, trying to 
console her, to talk some sense into 
her. Cilix never said anything. But 
then, he didn’t have to. 

The surrogate and 1 were begin- 
ning to arrive at a harmony of sorts. 
1 no longer suffered chills or bouts 
of nausea after the visions. I grew 
accustomed to the pain and 1 was 
no longer bothered by the stench 
that emanated from my body. 
Somehow I felt that John had han- 
dled it all better. 1 couldn’t find the 
strength to fight it, or the will, so 1 
just lay there helplessly, trying to 
accept the situation. Deep down in- 
side 1 couldn’t. But 1 tried not to 
think about that. There was nothing 
1 could do. Someday, maybe soon, 
1 would die . and then I would 
be free. 

But the surrogate was not con- 
tent. 

Day by day it struggled for con- 
trol of my persona. 

Do you want to be like John? 

1 am like John. 

You’re different. 



76 



GALAXY 




I’m the same. 

You won’t accept me. 

Have I got a choice? 

I want you to be functional. Not 
like John. He was an empty vessel. 

I had to laugh. It wanted me to 
be functional. Not like John. Play- 
ing gypsy wasn’t good enough for 
me. No, I was meant for some lof- 
tier purpose. The surrogate was 
practicing upward mobility. 

/ can’t think for you all the time. 
It’s tiring. 

What do you want from me? 
Accept me. 

Leave Jil alone. Stop hurting her. 

I felt a drop of moisture on my 
cheek and opened my eyes. Jil was 
looking down at me. She was cry- 
ing. 

“I can’t bear what it’s doing to 
you.” 

I sighed. I felt very tired. “Go 
away, Jil. Please. There’s nothing 
you can do.” 

She shook her head. “There must 
be something!” 

“Kill me.” 

“I’ve thought of that.” 

“I know.” 

“Yes. 1 know you know. It 
knows. It knows that I can’t do it, 
too. It hates me.” 

“/ hate you, Jil. Go away.” 
“You’re lying!” 

“Have it your way.” 

“You love me. I know you love 
me.” 

“You’re being used, Jil. I’m 
using you just like this thing is 
using me. Can’t you see that? Look 
at us. We’re like Anthrus and Irina. 
Please, Jil. I don’t want to live off 
your grief. I don’t want to use 
you.” 

“No! No! No one is using me. I 



won’t allow myself to be used.” 
“Jil—” 

’’Listen to me. You’re not using 
me. You can’t. You won’t. You 
could have used Irina. She wanted 
you to but you wouldn’t. You could 
have used John, to get back at An- 
thrus for what he put you through. 
But you didn’t.” 

She kneeled at my feet, holding 
on to my knees, resting her head 
upon them, a Juliet mourning her 
catatonic Romeo. 

“I can’t fight the creature for 
you. I would if I could. You have 
to fight it for yourself. ’ ’ 

“I can’t, Jil. I need it.” 

“It needs you!” 

“I’m not free, Jil.” 

“You’re wrong. You are, you 
Just don’t see it.” 

I was too tired to argue. But not 
too tired to beat her again that 
night. The surrogate gave me 
strength. My nightmare was the 
morning. 

All night I had visions of the 
Zharii. The masquerading monsters. 
The fiends that only surrogates 
could tame. Again I saw them dec- 
imate the Terrans. Only this time I 
was shown the retribution. 

I saw the Zharii slaughtered by 
the thousands. And the lizards along 
with them. My night was one vast 
sea of blood. 1 saw the seared and 
blackened yellow reptiles twitching 
in their death throes and 1 heard the 
high-pitched squeal of their agony. I 
felt my own flesh burning, crack- 
ling, crisping' 1 choked and gagged 
on the acrid-smelling smoke. I 
retched as all my inner senses were 
assailed by the massive spectacle of 
death. I came to screaming. Jil 
couldn’t hear me. 



THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



77 




I had bludgeoned her unconscious 
with the painting of John. 

* * * 

I don’t remember leaving. There 
was money in my pocket. I don’t 
know where I got it. I ate a hearty 
meal for the first time in what 
seemed like years. The surrogate 
was hidden underneath my jacket. I 
had washed, though 1 could not re- 
member washing. I was still a pret- 
ty miserable spectacle but at least I 
had the energy to walk and I didn’t 
smell as bad as before. 

Much of my mind was blank. I 
simply wasn’t thinking. I walked in 
a daze, dimly aware of taking one 
step at a time, vaguely knowing that 
I had a destination, yet not knowing 
what it was. I had left Jil lying in a 
crumpled heap on the floor. Her 
painting was ruined. But she’d be 
all right. She wasn’t dead — perhaps 
because I still had a spark of my 
old self within me — but she would 
never look the same again. I ran. 1 
ran because I didn’t want to kill 
her. 

The spaceport loomed before me. 
I entered through its massive gate. 

There would always be work 
for a paramed-rated phase-shift 
navigator. I had wanted to raise 
some hell. Well, I had found hell. 
It must have been painfully obvi- 
ous. Although there were plenty of 
berths for a man of my special tal- 
ents, 1 couldn’t seem to find one. 

In spite of all the pains I had 
taken to make myself appear pre- 
sentable, I still looked like a corpse. 
Captains have a tendency to be a bit 
particular as regards the physical 



health and emotional stability of 
their phase-shift navigators. It 
wouldn’t do to find a way into 
Superspace and not be able to locate 
an exit. I must have looked like a 
bad bet. I really can’t say that I 
blamed them. I had exhausted al- 
most all the possibilities by the end 
of the day. I still had one chance 
left and I was not crazy about it! 
There were those who didn’t mind 
employing the services of the flot- 
sam and jetsam of space. The 
Lhari. 

I had never been a mercenary and 
I once swore that I would never 
sink so low. But I had sunk a lot 
lower than I had thought was possi- 
ble. I had to get away. And there 
didn’t seem to be any other choice. 

As I waited to see the Lhari 
commander, I thought about the fu- 
mre. If I played my cards right, 
there was a chance that my habit 
might escape detection. How long 
had John been able to keep his sur- 
rogate a secret? I had no way of 
knowing. At any rate, I would jump 
ship at the earliest opportunity. 
Perhaps I’d be lucky enough to find 
my way to a deserted planetoid 
where I could hide until they gave 
up searching and then I could live 
out the remainder of my days in 
peaceful solitude. Peaceful? No. I 
didn’t think the lizard would ever 
allow me any peace. 

I was finally admitted into the 
presence of His Excellency Lord 
Commander Hhargoth. My papers 
were in order. He had condescended 
to see me. I took a deep breath and 
followed his lieutenant, who ill 
concealed his distaste at dealing 
with a Terran. And a poor specimen 
at that. 



78 



GALAXY 




The ceiling of the office was high 
to allow for the height of the Lhari. 
Even sitting down, Lord Comman- 
der Hhargoth dwarfed me. The red- 
flecked yellow pupils watched me 
with an expectant gaze. I hesitated 
before managing a salute, Lhari- 
style — closed fist extended, then 
opened to di.splay an empty hand. 
His Excellency seemed satisfied 
with that. He grunted, gave me a 
curt nod and proceeded to peruse 
my papers. 

He was frowning. It wasn’t a 
good sign. 

“Is something wrong. Your Ex- 
cellency?’’ 

He looked up slowly. “These are 
your papers?’’ 

It was simple enough to check. 
He knew that as well as I did. The 
question was rhetorical. 

“If they are forgeries, they are 
very good ones,’’ he said, his eyes 
not leaving me for an instant. 

I still did not reply. He was bait- 
ing me. My appearance was, of 
course, the reason. The man stand- 
ing in front of him could hardly be 
the navigator documented in the 
records . 

He obviously suspected narcotics 
of some sort. He was looking at my 
neck. The high collar of my jacket 
did not quite hide the scars. I saw 
his breathing quicken. 

“Remove your jacket.” 

“Forget it. Excellency. If you’ll 
just let me have my papers. I’ll 
be—” 

“Remove your jacket!” 

1 thumbed it open. Moving with 
uncanny speed, the lizard leaped! 

Hhargoth was even faster. He 
was on his feet and reaching for his 
sidearm split seconds before the 

THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



creature landed on his desk. He 
rushed his first shot and missed, 
demolishing the heavy quartzite 
desk. The surrogate realized its 
error and jumped back at me. It dug 
into my arm and I was off and run- 
ning. White pain exploded deep in 
my brain! 

I never faltered. I charged head- 
long into the lieutenant, bowling 
him over, and kept right on going. I 
breathed with gasping sobs, knock- 
ing into people as I ran. I didn’t 
stop until I was nearly a meter from 
the spaceport gate. My wind was 
gone. I stumbled heavily, regained 
my balance and lurched away into 
the crowd, wheezing like an asth- 
matic. I was being stared at. I 
reached for the wall of a building to 
steady myself . and fell. There 
had been nothing to reach with! My 
left arm was gone. Gone from the 
shoulder down. I stared in disbelief 
at the charred and crispy flesh. 

“Oh, God. Dear God, why me?” 

My vision blurred. I scrambled 
up and stumbled on. I found a quiet 
alleyway and there, surrounded by 
gray walls, I sank to the ground and 
cursed the day 1 was bom. I felt 
feverish. Again I reached with my 
left hand to wipe the sweat from my 
forehead and nothing happened. 
Uncontrollably I began to giggle. 1 
stuffed my remaining fist into my 
mouth to choke off the hysterics. I 
was cold. Very cold. I couldn’t 
keep from shaking. And I was 
sweating too. 

My demon was clinging to my 
leg. It had been badly frightened. 
Its eyes were wide and it was 
twitching its tail nervously from 
side to side. Its plot had backfired. 

Belatedly 1 realized that running 

79 




had never been my idea in the first 
place. I had only acted as the lizard 
had intended. Like a chessmaster, it 
had plotted out its moves and I had 
accepted every gambit. It hadn’t 
worked with John or with that other 
nameless crewman because they 
were only pawns. But as a 
navigator, I* could have been a 
bishop. Right up there with the 
king. A phase-shift navigator works 
in close proximity with the com- 
mander of his ship. And the lizard 
needed a commander. And not just 
any commander, but one who did 
not give a damn about the quaran- 
tine. One whose home world’s 
power placed him Just a bit outside 
the law. 

I had had to go through physical 
depravity so that no other crew 
would take me. Through me, the 
lizard almost had its Lhari. I would 
have been abandoned, left to die, 
and the lizard would be surrogate to 
the captain of a ship. The implica- 
tions were too terrible to dwell on. 

The light was fading fast now. I 
did not have the energy to move. I 
wanted to sleep but was afraid to 
close my eyes. I might never open 
them again. How had Hhargoth 
known? If they ignored the quaran- 
tine, then perhaps my surrogate was 
not the only one. 

There was a silhouette at the en- 
trance to the alley. Someone had 
stopped and was standing there, 
hesitant. I scuttled like a lobster, 
creeping farther back into the dark- 
ness. The silhouette came closer. 
Whoever it was, he was moving er- 
ratically as though drunk. It looked 
too short to be a Lhari . And when it 
called my name, I whimpered. 

It was Jil. 



Words alone cannot describe the 
way she looked. I crawled away 
from her like an insect, until there 
was no further place to crawl. And 
there I huddled like a baby, my arm 
covering my head, my legs drawn 
up beneath me. That’s how she 
found me, calling for my mother. 

“Why did you go? Why did you 
leave me, why?’’ 

I threw myself upon her and 
cried. I held on to her as though she 
were the last reality in the universe. 
She held me, cradled me and 
stroked my hair. And then she saw 
the ugly wound of my left arm. Her 
feline howl of anguish was heart- 
rending. 

Gently, slowly, she helped me 
peel off my jacket. The material at 
the shoulder had been melded with 
the flesh and it came away reluc- 
tantly. She wrapped the jacket 
around me and held me as I shiv- 
ered. The night was quiet. Almost. 
A long way off, I heard somebody 
scream. Then I felt a movement. 
The surrogate was climbing up my 
leg. I groaned. Perhaps it wasn’t re- 
ally very hungry. I had nothing left 
to give. 

Jil released me, sighing heavily. 
For the first time she spoke directly 
to the creature. 

“No,” she pleaded softly. “He’s 
hurt. He can’t. You’ll kill him. 
Please. Take me.” 

And she held out her haiiJ. 

The lizard halted. It tur ed and 
looked at her . and it made a de- 
cision. It crawled onto her hand and 
started to climb up her arm. 

Even now I don’t know what 
possessed me. I don’t know where I 
found the strength. With my right 
hand I swiped at it and knocked it 



80 



GALAXY 




from her arm. And then I lunged. I 
dove upon it. I grabbed its 
hindquar*ers with my fingers and I 
roared and I dug my teeth into its 
neck. 

There was a great buzzing in my 
ears. The creature squealed and 
titrashed between my jaws and I bit 
down with all the strength that 1 
could muster. Cold blood spurted 
into my mouth. I gagged but I did 
not let go. I was like an animal 
goaded into a frenzy that it could 
not control. I growled and shook 
my head, tearing at the flesh. 
Chunks of it came away and 1 had 
swallowed half of the cold body be- 
fore the lizard was dead. 

1 lifted up my head, my jaws 
agape. 

Jil fainted. 

* * * 

I was different then. I had wanted 
to raise some hell. It was an excit- 
ing city. The new Rome to which 
all space routes led. But like the 
original Rome of primordial times, 
this new Rome had its share of de- 
cadence and desolation. 1 had been 
attracted by the decadence. What 1 
found instead was something else 
entirely. 

Jil is with me now. I’m feeling 
better and I’m working. Working 
hard. We have much to live for and 
there’s much to do. 

Anthrus had been right about one 
thing: It was an experience that I’ll 
remember. As the surrogate had 
said, nobody really wants to hear 
the truth when lies are so much 
more attractive. I had learned the 
truth about myself. 

And I survived. ★ 




THE SURROGATE MOUTH 



81 




THE INEVITABLE REVOLUTION 



lou COMMONLY HEAR the 
expression: “It blew my mind.” 
Generally what’s then described is 
rather prosaic. Hyperbole is a 
chronic disease of this decade. 

Thus, though I’m tempted, I 
won’t start this column with that 
trite phrase — but I have had a 
thought-provoking experience. I’ve 
just come back from the National 
Computing Convention. 

Set the scene; we have driven to 
Anaheim in Orange County. We 
expect traffic: we have to go past 
Disneyland. But the traffic moves 
nicely past Disney’s fantasy world, 
and gets jammed up a couple of 
blocks further on as we continue 
toward the Anaheim convention 
center. 

Surely, thought 1, this can’t be 
traffic for the computer convention. 
A computer convention? But it was. 
Over 25,000 people, some in 
business suits, some in typical 
California garb, some in robes or 
other exotic wear; the Convention 
Center parking lot full, with 

82 



overflow directed to Disneyland; 
half-hour and longer lines for 
registration; and still they poured in. 

I gave up and went to the press 
room, not unwilling to pay, but 
entirely unwilling to stand in the 
lines. One finds science fiction 
readers everywhere — one of the nice 
young ladies at the press registration 
desk reads the column. I got a press 
badge and fought my way toward 
the exhibit rooms. 

Rooms. Here is one of the 
world’s largest exhibition halls — 
and it is filled, so that many of the 
biggest names in computing (DEC 
for example) are out in the 
garage — and still there was 
overflow, so that the personal 
computing exhibits were half a mile 
away at the Disneyland Hotel. 

The exhibition halls were packed. 
Jammed with people and with 
computers. Everyone has got into 
the business. All the giants, of 
course, but thousands of others, 
some of which you’ve heard of; 
others familiar, but not in 



GALAXY 



computers — did you know that Ball 
Brothers, whieh make jars for 
home canning, is one of the biggest 
management consulting firms 
around, and also heavily into 
electronics and computers? And the 
others just coming up. 

There were business systems 
ranging from a few thousand dollars 
through “low-cost mainframes” in 
the hundred- thousand-dollar bracket 
to IBM’s marvels. There were 
robots (disappointingly controlled 
by hidden operators) and 
mechanical mice. But mostly there 
were computing capabilities for 
sale. 

Thousands of firms, each selling 
equipment that five years ago didn’t 
exist in the most sophisticated 
laboratories on Earth, and all 
worried because their expensive 
equipment is likely to be obsolete in 
a few months. 

I’ve already mentioned that I do 
my work on a computer system 
now. I am typing this onto a 
TV-like screen, and if I make a 
mistake I simply backspace and 
type over it. The other day 1 tried to 
use my old reliable IBM Selectric 2 
and gave up in disgust; I’m spoiled. 
My own system was not cheap, but 
within a few years all but one part 
of it will be affordable by nearly 
anyone. The exception is the 
typewriter that produces the text 
once I’m finished — and at the NCC 
I saw a line printer that’s faster than 
my Diablo and costs about $500, a 
price that’s sure to fall. 

In the fifties 1 got interested in 
computers, largely from science 
fiction stories; and when I was 
given an opportunity to visit the 
ILIAC, then the world’s most 



powerful machine, I hitch-hiked (a 
bigger deal in those days than now) 
five hundred miles or so as quickly 
as possible. 

ILIAC was huge. It nearly filled 
the gymnasium that housed it. Bank 
upon bank of vacuum tubes, with 
the world’s largest air-conditioning 
system running full time to keep it 
happy. Because tubes could burn 
out while it considered its problems, 
each computation was done three 
times, and a majority vote taken to 
determine the accepted answer. 

Three undergraduates ran about 
within the vitals of this machine. 
They pushed shopping carts full of 
vacuum tubes, and they spent their 
time replacing burned-out items. 

I have on my desk a calculator 
more powerful than ILIAC was. My 
son carries another on his belt, 
bought, I think, for $60 a year ago, 
and probably available for half that 
now. Sure, it was 25 years ago that 
I visited ILIAC; but in that 25 years 
there has been a revolution. 
ANYONE can afford more 
computing power than was available 
to the wealthiest organization in the 
world (the U.S. government) in 
ILIAC ’s day. 

Which is why I am confident that 
within a decade or less every one of 
my readers will have computers far 
better than the one I’m writing this 
on. 



A revolution. Where does it lead? 



Well, first to a complete 
restructuring of the publishing 
industry. This isn’t something that 
will take twenty years; the 
equipment exists today. The only 

83 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 




missing items are cheap 

mass-channel communications and 
business expertise. 

The space Shuttle will take care 
of the communications. Within five 
years, the Shuttle will have put up 
enough relay satellites to have open 
several million simultaneous 

p>ersonal communications channels; 
the two-way wrist radio and the 
pocket telephone will almost 

certainly be common well before 
the end of the 80’s. In fact, the 
biggest probleni at the moment is 
the billing system; how do the 
investors recover their money? 

Keeping records of telephone use 
and billing accounts costs about as 
much as operating the system right 
now; with millions of micro-wave 
linked satellite-relayed channels the 
record keeping becomes impossible. 

Thus the entire philosophy of 
telephonic communications 

billing — pay for time and distance 
of communication actually used — 
will have to be changed, probably 
in favor of a flat monthly billing 
charge. There may be an attempt at 
statistical sampling to determine 
base billing rates so that those who 
use their telephones the most will 
pay the most, but implementation of 
that isn’t cheap either. We feel that 
use charges are more fair than flat 
rates averaged among everyone: but 
if the use charges themselves raise 
rates for everyone, then they aren’t 
fair at all. 

So — assume that communication 
unlimited by time and (within the 
continent anyway) distance will be 
available at nominal cost. 

You’ve all seen the Radio Shack 
computer systems: $600 for their 
basic unit, which I admit isn’t very 

84 



versatile (although its biggest 
defect is its incompatibility with 
anything else; same problem as 
Heathkit’s system). The Radio 
Shack system includes alphabetic 
capabilities and an input keyboard. 

I note that Ball is selling 
something very similar, and there 
are a number of other small 
computer systems with word- 
handling capabilities for under a 
thousand dollars; and these are 
first-generation mass-market items. 
Texas Instruments hasn’t made its 
move yet, nor have some of the 
other giants in pocket calculators, 
although by the time this is 
published TI may have some 
spectacular items for sale. It will 
still all be first-generation 

pricing — my TI SR-50 cost me 
$150 when it first came out, and 
now I can buy a better calculator 
with logs and trig and exponential 
notation for about $15 — and the 
prices may be expected to tumble 
by half and better as the 
competition gets into the act. 

Present-day systems are some- 
what memory limited: mine can get 
the text editor and about 5, (WO 
words of text into its memory and I 
have about as elaborate a 
micro-computer as you can buy; but 
that too will change. Bubble 
memory, which stores information 
as tiny magnetic bubbles; 

charge-coupled devices; cheap disk 
systems; there are a number of 
innovations on the market that will 
allow storage of a million or so 
words in a box smaller than a peach 
crate and requiring no more 
electricity than a light bulb. These 
will come along in the next two or 
three years at most. The personal 

GALAXY 




computer you’ll have before 1985 
will be to mine as mine is to the old 
ILIAC. 

And that is the end of the 
publishing industry as we know it. 

Consider: at the moment I write a 
book in machine-readable form. I 
massage the text with all kinds of 
special features (inserting words, 
lines, paragraphs, etc; deleting 
blocks of text and moving other 
blocks around; correcting spellings; 
etc.) until I am happy with it — at 
which point the Diablo types it off 
onto paper, which is mailed to New 
York where my editor reads it and 
sends it off to a composer who 
re-types it into machine-readable 
form and sends that to another 
automatic typing device which 
makes a camera-ready copy which 
is then offset printed. The result is 
bound into a book which is 
transported across country to 
warehouses; the boxes of books are 
(I hope) opened and put onto trucks 
and carried into book stores, drug 
stores, etc., where (I more fervently 
hope) people buy them. 

A very vulnerable process. 
Certainly it will not be long before 
the text is transmitted to my editors 
as electronic beeps and read by the 
editor on a screen like mine; this 
will greatly simplify the editing job 
and completely eliminate typesetter 
errors. 

But note this; sure, some readers 
are collectors, and want the actual 
physical book; but a great deal of 
material publish^ has no value 
except as information, and keeping 
the physical book is a chore rather 
than a pleasure. Couldn’t the 
information (and entertainment 
value, etc.) be transferred without 



all that printing and carrying of 
heavy objects? 

And it’s clear that it can. I could 
write my books on my machine, 
and for a small charge deposit them 
into a national data bank; access to 
this would be by credit-card code, 
and those who want to read the 
book get it fed into their home (and 
eventually pocket) TV-like screen. 
A charge goes from their bank 
account to mine — and where does 
the publisher fit into the picture? 

Of course there will then be such 
a plethora of -books — anyone can 
“publish” under this 

arrangement — that the readers will 
be utterly unable to keep up. Thus 
there is a need for good reviewers, 
and editors will very likely 
remain — people like John Campbell 
and Bob Gleason and Jim Baen do 
more than select books; they help 
authors considerably in their 
creation. There is not, though, 
much need for the publisher as he 
exists today. 

Note also that schools and other 
public institutions are likely to be 
among the first to have the new 
electronic “books,” so that a very 
large chunk of the publishing 
industry activity is affected rather 
quickly. 

All right. That’s an easily 
predictable effect of the electronics 
revolution. What else? 

All major political philosophies, 
both “liberal” and “conservative,” 
were formed at a time when 
“classes” were inevitable. There 
was simply no possibility that all 
the world’s population could be 
wealthy. The latest of the major 
philosophies, Marxism, where it is 

85 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 




original (much of Marx has roots in 
Plato) was forged in a time when 
the industrial revolution made 
possible a “middle class,” but 
when it was still thought impossible 
that that class would be large. 

In Marx ’s * day wealth consisted 
of: enough to eat; changes of 
clothing; opportunities for travel; 
several hours leisure per day 
(leisure being defined as time to do 
what one liked, whether reading or 
drinking or gambling or studying or 
going fishing); and access to 
education for one’s children. 
Dentistry and medicine were so 
primitive that the wealthiest kings 
did not expect, in Marx’s day, to be 
comfortable or have teeth past the 
age of 50. 

Under those terms nearly 
everyone in the United States is 
wealthy: anyone can travel, the 
poorest have some change of 
clothing available, and if you starve 
it’s your election: at the worst the 
Salvation Army will feed you for 
the cost of a lecture. Everyone has 
leisure today: no one works 12 
hours a day because he has to. 

Moreover, there are opportunities 
and capabilities not dreamed of in 
Aristotle’s time when the 
non-Marxist political ideas were 
framed. 

The electronic revolution makes 
this more evident. Consider data 
banks and information. At the 
moment public libraries do have a 
great deal of information available 
freely to anyone who cares to visit 
them; electronics will extend that to 
be more convenient. But extrapolate 
from that: is it not obvious that 
government could provide an 
enormous pool of information made 

86 



freely available to its citizens? The 
late David MacDaniel postulated 
something of the sort in his story 
“Prognosis: Terminal” (2020 

VISION, ed. by J. E. Pournelle, 
Avon 1972) and the capabilities are 
much greater now than he had 
predicted for the year 2020. 

Greg Benford, in his In the 
Ocean of Night, has medical 
electronics that allow physicians to 
watch over their patients as they go 
about their daily business; so does 
Steve Robinett in “The Man 
Responsible.” Neither capability is 
technologically impossible with 
present-day equipment. 

The point is that we may see a 
vast expansion of potential services, 
many of which can most 
conveniently be provided by some 
kind of public organization; and at 
the same time most of us have 
learned to distrust “government” 
and almost everyone, liberal or 
conservative, wants to see 
government limited. Fine, say the 
Libertarians: let private organiza- 
tions set up the information utilities 
and services. 

Unfortunately it isn’t that simple. 
It’s like the personal telephones 
with satellite relays: the cost is not 
high on a government scale (a 
couple of billion dollars for the 
information network, plus perhaps 
fifty bucks each for the telephones 
themselves) but it certainly is more 
than most industries can 
invest — because who is going to 
pay them back? 

Ditto in spades for an information 
utility. To create and maintain an 
enormous data base requires that it 
be available to nearly everyone: 
restricting the users to any small 

GALAXY 




number would cost each user too 
much to make it worthwhile. But if 
you open the lines to everyone or 
nearly so, then how do you keep 
those who haven’t paid from using 
it? The record keeping and billing 
would cost a good bit more than the 
information service itself. 

We have thus a kind of tragedy 
of the commons: if you don’t have 
to pay the subscription fee a lot of 
users won’t pay. This is not only 
unfair to those who do, but also a 
powerful disincentive to setting the 
system up in the first place. 
Operators of subscriber-supported 
radio and TV stations are 
perpetually having to conduct fund 
drives and auctions and the like, 
and most barely survive; yet they 
need a very small amount compared 
to the costs of an information 
utility. 

The advantages of public data 
banks, and information/ 

communication utilities for “pub- 
lishing” and the like, are obvious. 
The disadvantages of giving 
anything that big to traditional 
government are also obvious, while 
the difficulties of persuading private 
investors into putting money in 
enterprises almost guaranteed not to 
be able to collect for their services 
are not small. 

Thus the electronics revolution 
should lead to the search for 

something that is neither 
government nor private; a new kind 
of organizational structure, with 

new methods of making it 
responsible (in the original meaning 
of the term) to its users. 

There’s more we can predict with 
confidence. 

For example, the implanted 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



computers my characters wear in 
my Aeneas MacKenzie series are 
likely to be available well before 
the end of the century. In my 
stories I postulate that they are 
available only to the very wealthy, 
but in fact I suspect they won’t cost 
much more than my computer has 
cost me. 

By implant, I mean a system that 
lets the owner think directly into his 
computer: ask questions by thinking 
them, and get answers fed into his 
auditory nerves so that he “hears” 
them. The system can connect to a 
national data base, so that any 
question can instantly be answered. 

Consider that: any question 

(provided the answer is known), 
any calculation; any piece of data 
the user wants is instantly available. 
What does that do to “education” 
as we know it? Certainly students 
will have to be taught a minimum 
of factual information and 
mathematical principles — but just 
how much is needed if you have a 
vast library and computation system 
available by thinking the questions? 

The implications for government 
are not small here, either. Court 
records and police files can be 
available instantly to probation and 
sentencing officers, and to 
detectives. European nations, 
particularly France, have for 
decades kept track of where 
everyone is: citizen or foreigner, if 
you stay in a French hotel the 
police in Paris get a card notifying 
them of it. 

So far that hasn’t been all that 
useful; there’s too much 
information, and it is not often 
used. The electronics revolution 
would change all that. It will soon 

87 




be quite possible to keep track of 
everyone; where they are, whom 
they meet with, etc. It’s a 
frightening capability and moreover 
one not necessarily limited to 
governments. A primitive “paper 
trail” of your purchases and 
payments . already exists in 
credit-card files and credit-rating 
data banks. 

How shall we control that? Or 
can we at all? 

George Orwell notes in Down 
and out in Paris and London that 
the English are willing to put up 
with much higher crime rates than 
the French, because the English are 
unwilling to give police and 
government the kinds of powers 
routinely used by the French. (This 
may well have changed in England 
since Orwell’s time. I The increasing 
wealth of the nation and the vast 
increase in purchasing power 
available even to the poorest rather 
dramatically demonstrates that crime 
is not caused by “poverty”; most 
criminals don’t know what real 
poverty is. Thus we have no great 
hope that even if we go to space 
and chattel goods become very 
cheap and very widespread the 
crime rates will drop. 

The government’s ability to take 
measures to deal with crime will 
increase with wealth and cheap 
electronics; is anyone giving any 
thought on how we should use that 
capability, and how we should limit 
government’s powers? It’s high time 
we did; never has any potential 
problem been more easily predicted. 

There’s more yet. 

Beyond the implant is the 
computer interface that bypasses the 
peripherals and feeds information 

88 



direct: not as words, but as direct 
memory into the brain. It is not 
impossible. The brain is an 
informative-processing ' system, and 
uses an internal code. That code can 
be solved. 

It’s probably true that each 
person has a different code; this 
may be why telepathy is so 
notoriously unreliable (and why 
identical twins seem to have the 
ability to communicate with each 
other in ways others have not). But 
suppose everyone does have a 
different code: electronics are 

cheap, and a personal computer can 
learn to understand my code if not 
yours; my computer can talk to your 
computer; and the information 
transfer rate can be enormous, 
thousands of times faster than the 
present system of speech or words 
on paper. 

We may well see such systems 
within my lifetime. We will almost 
certainly see them within the 
lifetimes of most of my readers. 
Consider: an ability to do calculus 
squirted into your head within a few 
minutes, followed by intensive 
exercises to make you aware of 
your new knowledge. This might 
take as much as two weeks: at 
present calculus is a year or more at 
most engineering colleges. 

Ditto with physics, foreign 
languages, much of biology. 
Languages should be particularly 
amenable to such techniques, as 
learning them involves no 
unfamiliar concepts at all, only a 
new way of expressing what you 
already know. 

What does all this do to the 
education establishment? 

Now it’s true that science fiction 

GALAXY 




has been dealing with these 
concepts for a long time. Computer 
translators, data banks, personal 
dossiers instantly available to the 
police, and other such concepts 
have been in our stories for 
decades; but 1 think most SF writers 
would be the first to admit that they 
haven’t really thought through the 
implications. 

We have very few stories on 
what it would really be like to live 
in a world in which there are no 
“poor” and no one is required 
through economic necessity to take 
a job he doesn’t care for. 

Of course there’s Huxley’s Brave 
New World as well as Orwell’s 
1984, and Williamson’s Humanoids 
series, but our speculations have 
largely been superficial. 

Yet they’re the best we have. 
Science fiction may not be adequate 
as a description of the real future, 
but it provides marvels of insight 
compared to most of the products of 
academic social “science.” 

We could also go the other way: 
give up research and development, 
cancel the space program, go 
toward “Small Is Beautiful” and 
“Appropriate Technology, ” which is 
to say labor-intensive systems. We 
could spiral slowly into the world 1 
have described in some of my 
stories, a world in which there are 
technological marvels, but they are 
not used to make the population 
wealthy; a World in which there is 
very little economic slack so that 
investment is difficult or 
impossible. 

Or the more frightening world in 
which new technology is used to 
stifle new developments; in which

the benefits of technology are kept 
for the governing class, and new 
inventions are used exclusively by 
government or suppressed al- 
together. 

That too is possible; because 
while we have some control over 
who shall us« the new computer 
technologies, we have none at all 
over whether they will exist. 

They’re already with us. Not in 
their full-blown state, of course: we 
can’t even use what we have. 1 
looked at a dozen programs for 
small business record-keeping 
systems and none of them produced 
books 1 could have got my 
accountant to sign without getting 
her dead drunk first. But these are 
temporary abberations — in my case 
1 solved the problem by writing my 
own programs to produce standard 
books of the kinds described in 
college accounting texts rather than 
the “special reports’’ so beloved by 
computer programmers. 

True: computers sometimes do 
ridiculous things. They send checks 
for a million dollars to someone 
expecting ninety cents. We can all 
laugh at these incidents and feel 
secure because we wouldn’t be so 
stupid as to do that. 

But that won’t stop the machines. 
Their capabilities increase hourly, 
and their price falls yearly. 

A favorite game of historians is 
to try to determine exactly when 
some great event became inevitable: 
what trivial happening marked the 
true beginning of the French 
Revolution, or World War 1, or the 
Thirty Years War. 

It is a game because no one can 
be certain. Events wend on, and 
their trends are not seen; suddenly it 



is apparent that there is a trend, and 
that the world is due for inevitable 
changes. 

When the Archduke was shot at 
Sarajevo the assassination triggered 
events that historians now think 
may have been inevitable; yet few 
suspected the Great War was 
coming even then. 

In August when the armies 
marched some still thought it would 
be over in a few weeks; that the 
Great War would be similar to the 
lightning campaigns of the 
Austro-Prussian and Franco-EYussian 
wars, and this despite the terrible 
example of the American Civil 
War. 

By the following spring it was 
obvious to everyone: the world of 
1915 was not the world of 1912. 
Everything was different, and 
nothing could revive the past. 

As I walked through the exhibit 
halls of the National Computing 
Convention 1 had the same 
experience: there is no chance that a 
world with those capabilities at 
those prices will be a lot like that of 
1968. 

1 don’t know which way it will 
go. 1 like to think we have 
considerable control over events 
yet. 

We can use the new capabilities 
to expand our opportunities, to 
create what 1 call real freedoms, 
namely choices we can really 
exercise; or we can watch while the 
new capabilities are absorbed into 
traditional structures never designed 
to cope with them. 

Whatever we decide, the 
revolution is upon us. The one thing 
we can’t do is put the djinn back in 
the bottle. ★

Being unemployed is never pleasant. But 
sometimes it’s an opportunity, if you 
know how to take it! 



The rest are dead. I’m all 
alone, sitting by the radio half the 
twenty-one hour day, listening to 
static while I wonder if that auto- 
matic beacon is still beaming its 
SOS into space. There must be 
some way you can tell if it’s work- 
ing. But then if it isn’t, I couldn’t fix 
it anyway. My job on the spaceship 
didn’t exactly prepare me for being 
the last survivor on an alien world. 
I was the ship’s whore. 

Or sex therapist, if you want my 
official title. That’s not what our 
captain called me, though. A sex 
therapist is the one officer most 
vital to the success of a standard ten- 
year space exploration mission, they 
told me when I went in to see what 
jobs were available. You might say 
it’s the malamute on the dogteam 
that keeps the huskies pulling to- 
gether instead of fighting. Now this 
malamute is fresh out of huskies. 
I’ve got no one left to do my job 
on. And I can’t even tell if the god- 
damn radio is working. 

Outside the dome the air is 
breathable, if you don’t mind string 
things growing in your lungs. String 
things are long, white threads that 
wriggle and shrink up when you 
touch them. Or rather, when who- 
ever dissects you, to find out why 
you died, touches them. Lenny and 
Mack died from string things, after 
coughing and gasping for a week. 



Bryce, who did the dissection al- 
though he was dying himself from 
the gangrene in his broken leg, said 
the string things were a motile fun- 
gpid that grew from inhaled spores. 
He guessed they put out fruiting 
bodies — mushrooms — on the corpses 
of their victims. We didn’t keep 
Lenny and Mack around long 
enough to find out. 

And the others? Well, after the 
ship was holed. Rich (our captain) 
and Fred (communications and 
computer technician) went down in 
the lander to reconnoiter. They 
never came back. Spaceships aren’t 
supposed to land on planets, but by 
that time we didn’t have a choice. 
Q.C. was lucky. He died in the 
crash. Bryce got his leg mashed 
and, being ship’s surgeon, he ig- 
nored the infection until it was too 
late. Lew was eaten by something 
that leaves webbed footprints a 
meter long. Webfoot upchucked 
him later, but that didn’t help Lew 
any. All they ever found of Hugo 
was his beret floating on a bottom- 
less mud puddle. Kris came down 
with fever, broke out in purple pus- 
tules, ran screaming into the rain. 
Mel was the last to go. He died in 
his sleep. I wish 1 could have fig- 
ured out why, but my residency was 
in psychiatry. 

Luckily, I don’t get involved with 
people. That’s one reason I’m good

at my job. A ship’s whore can’t 
start playing favorites, not on a 
ten-year exploratory cruise. So it’s 
not that I’m particularly bothered by 
anyone’s death, or the' nasty ways 
they picked to die. I Just wish I had 
somebody around who could tell me 
if the funny rumble in the air filter 
is anything serious. 

It occurs to me that rationing out 
coffee to myself may represent a 
ridiculous overindulgence in op- 
timism. Will 1 be here tomorrow to 
enjoy the coffee I save today? I do 
have a permanent food supply, as- 
suming the algae tanks don’t go bad 
on me. For as long as I’m here I’ll 
have plenty of green goop to bake, 
boil or fry, as I like. The only way 
I really like it is fried out in paper- 
thin pancakes, with lots of raspberry 
jam. I was eating raspberry jam like 
there was no tomorrow; then sud- 
denly it was tomorrow, and no 
more raspberry jam. The choco- 
late’s almost gone, too. I’m saving 
what’s left for emergencies. The 
coffee supply is in better shape. If I 
limit myself to two cups a day it 
will last a year. By limiting myself 
to two cups a day, I assume I 11 last 
a year. Assuming that is good for 
my morale. I can hold out until res- 
cue comes. 

Or maybe it means I won’t be 
rescued for a year. If I ’m rescued at 
all. If the transmitter is still work- 
ing. Worrying about the coffee 
starts me worrying about other 
things as well. Maybe 1 should 
adopt a “live for today and let the 
devil take tomorrow” attitude. Or, I 
could make a list of all the reasons 
for and against rationing coffee and 
see which side has the most 
reasons. Not all reasons are equally 



good, though. I could score the 
reasons one through five and add up 
the numbers. Words are such slip- 
pery things, I always feel much 
more secure with the results when I 
can reduce my sentences to numbers 
and treat them mathematically. 
There’s safety in numbers, as 
Mother always used to say (in a 
slightly different context). 

Or maybe 1 could limit myself to 
four cups a day, and plan on lasting 
six months. Or three cups and nine 
months. Or make the coffee half 
strength, and... Decisions, deci- 
sions! Anyway, it gives me some- 
thing to think about. 

All day 1 feel safe in the 
fiberglass dome the men set up 
around our wreched spaceship. The 
flare of the afterburners must have 
sterilized the soil, for no new plants 
have grown up inside this charmed 
circle. Outside the dome the jungle 
presses in. Shadow of branches 
wave across the milk-white trian- 
gles. Shadow vines grow up the 
dome’s sides, putting out more 
shadows I like to think are flowers. 
Now and then something nut-like 
bounces off the dome. Sometimes 
little animals scamper across it. Noth- 
ing gets through. All day I feel 
sure that even Webfoot could not 
penetrate the dome. 

At night I’m not so sure. Once 
the light goes, nuts crash against the 
dome with the force of missiles 
hurled to pierce it. The scampering 
animals are no longer squirrels in 
my mind — they’re vampire bats. 
The strange rumble in the air filter 
begins to sound like an incipient 
failure. Then I go into the ship, pile 
boxes against the jagged hole that 
serves as doorway (the ship is lying 



UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM

on its airlock), and read until 1 fall 
asleep with the light on. 

I’m reading the Great Books in 
order from A to Z, no cheating al- 
lowed. Most of them are quite dull, 
actually, so I just skim them. That’s 
why I’m already to the M’s. If I 
ever get out of this alive, boy, am I 
going to have culture! 

There are windows in the dome, 
triangles of clear plastic. Lichen- 
like plants have grown over them, 
making Jack Frost patterns in 
orange, turquoise and violet. Mel 
went out in full protective clothing 
to scrape them off, on the last day 
of his life. I sure wish I knew what 
he died of. Since then the lichens 
have grown back and now I can’t 
see out anymore. Not that there was 
ever much to see; just masses of 
slimy black branches dripping with 
thick ropes of spaghetti, most of it 
toadstool — white powdered here and 
there with tints of copper or blue- 
green as though it had bread mold. 
Sometimes there were great thrash- 
ings in the vegetation. Was Web- 
foot plowing through it? 1 never 
saw what was making the commo- 
tion. Now 1 can’t see out at all. 
Maybe it’s just as well. If 1 could see 
out, I would probably stare out the 
window all day, waiting for some- 
thing to happen. As it is, I keep 
busy. Reading Great Books. And 
I’m making a flower garden. 

No, I’m not growing plants from 
seed. I wish I did have flower 
seeds — and a green thumb to go 
with them! I don’t have either one. 
I’m making flowers out of wire and 
scrap metal that 1 weld together 
with a laser torch. The tulips and 
daffodils came out the best. So far 
my peonies have all been failures, 

94 



but 1 keep trying. 

There are fresh mounds of dirt in 
my flower garden. Has some gigan- 
tic gopher invaded the charmed cir- 
cle of my dome? The possibility 
worries me. Not that the intruder 
might eat my metal flowers, or even 
me! I worry about diseases the crea- 
ture might bring in with it. It looks 
like I’ll have to stay up tonight and 
try to catch the thing. 

* * * 

I didn’t have to wait long. The 
animal came out of its burrow at 
dusk and I hit it with a pipe before 
it knew 1 was there. Then I hit it 
again until was so mashed-looking 
it had to be dead. It’s a stocky, tail- 
less, cat-sized creature with stout, 
heavily clawed forelegs, web-footed 
hindlegs, and a pair of tiny, almost 
human arms flanking the wide, lip- 
less mouth on the front end of the 
body. No neck; it looks like a fish 
with six legs. Multi-faceted eyes on 
retractable stalks take the place of 
turning one’s head. One eyestalk 
had been damaged and was re- 
generating. The animal’s mottled 
gray skin feels velvety through my 
surgical gloves, although it has no 
fur. 

As the closest thing to a biologi- 
cal officer our wrecked ship has 
left, I suppose I should dissect the 
creature. All I can think of is bury- 
ing it fast, before it contaminates 
the dome. I dig a little grave and 
shove the -body in. As I do, a pack- 
et falls out of the wide, fishy 
mouth. I pick up the small, ovoid, 
chamois-textured bag. Inside, some- 
thing wriggles. 

I can’t resist slitting open the 
GALAXY 




bag. An infant giant gopher wrig- 
gles out. It’s ivory, kitten-sized, 
much like its mother, except it’s a 
lot cuter. Do giant gophers give 
birth through their mouths, or was 
this one carrying her eggs one by 
one to a new nest inside my dome? 
Both, I decide. Giant gophers have 
a single, all-purpose orifice that 
doubles as mouth and cloaca; and 
one of the burrows in my flower 
garden contains a second egg, a 
dead one, in a nest lined with insu- 
lation swiped from the spaceship. 

Must 1 kill and bury the baby? I 
can’t bear to, it’s much too cute. 
An animal that’s just hatched out 
must be reasonably disease-free, I 
assure myself. And it’s so warm 
and deliciously soft to the touch. 

What do infant giant gophers 
eat? Green goop from human algae 
tanks, 1 learn. The little fellow eats 
daintily, scooping up tiny handfuls 
with its feeding arms and wiping 
them into its mouth. What else does 
it need? To be kept warm? 1 make a 
home for it in my breast pocket. 
There it spends most of its time 
sleeping, with interludes of stretch- 
ing, wriggling and placid gurgling 
that mean it’s getting hungry again. 

I name my pet “Broke.” Gopher 
Broke. 

* * * 

The windows cleared up over- 
night. At first I thought the scale 
died and fell off. Now 1 see that it’s 
being scraped off as it forms by 
lava snakes — dull black, rough- 
textured animals the shape and size 
of legless alligators. They Have di- 
vided tails they use for grasping, 
tiny feeding arms like Broke’s on 



either side of their lipless toothless 
mouths, and eyestalks like colored 
golf balls on matching tees. 

Every half hour or so a lava 
snake climbs the vines growing up 
over the dome and peers in the 
window, smacking its lips. Or 
rather, flexing its mouth; lava 
snakes don’t have lips. Why? I 
wonder. Do lava snakes eat people? 
Certainly they’re big enough. Only 
there aren’t any people on this 
world for them to practice on. Are 
there? Maybe they gobbled up Rich 
and Fred, decided they liked the 
flavor, and have been looking 
around for more ever since. More 
likely, something about the dome 
makes the lava snakes think it’s an 
egg. A giant egg. And lava snakes 
are programmed to wait around 
until giant eggs hatch out, so they 
can destroy the young Webfoots be- 
fore they get big enough to destroy 
the lava snakes. 

Either way. I’m safe enough as 
long as I stay in the dome. 1 don’t 
think I should go outside, though. 

Now that I’ve figured out what 
the lava snakes are up to, 1 wonder 
what happened to Rich and Fred. 
They called the ship to say they 
landed safely. They also said they 
were going outside to look around. 
That was the last we heard from 
them. Do lava snakes think a lander 
looks like a giant egg? 

This is my first space trip, so I 
really can’t judge. A lot of the sci- 
entists on board were old space 
hands, though, and they agreed with 
me that Rich was being irresponsi- 
ble. A good captain would stay with 
his crippled ship, and send someone 
else down to check out the nearest 
planet’s surface, preferably bio-

legists and geologists, who know 
what precautions to take on strange 
worlds. Not Rich. Bravely he vol- 
unteered to lead the landing party 
himself, and who did he take along 
with him? A scientist trained in in- 
terpreting planetary surfaces? Not 
Rich. He took* his best buddy, the 
computer repairman! Then, instead 
of leaving somebody behind to 
bring back our only intact lander, 
they both go out together, and 
promptly disappear! That’s our 
Cap’n Rich for you. No sense, just 
a lot of mock heroics. And if you 
think he’s a lousy spaceship cap- 
tain, you should see what he’s like 
in bed. 

Oh, he’s no great lover, but then, 
spacemen never are. They make 
love like they’re docking with an 
orbiting space station. It’s what he 
did afterwards that made Rich un- 
usual. He liked to sit around for 
ten, fifteen minutes and tell me 
what a dirty, filthy etc. whore I 
was. Well, if that’s how he felt, I 
suppose he had to talk about it, and 
it’s my Job to listen, no matter how 
bored I get. Still, I wonder how a 
man as basically unstable as Rich 
ever got command of a spaceship. 

As for Fred, he made love in the 
same dull, plodding way he did ev- 
erything else. After a year or so I 
stopped faking orgasm to see if 
he’d notice. He never did. That’s 
Fred for you. I think the real reason 
Rjch liked him so much was that he 
could be sure he was smarter than 
Fred. Everyone else aboard ship had 
at least one doctorate. Not that Fred 
was really stupid. He was Just slow. 
He had to get off by himself and 
think for an hour or so before he 
could commit himself to an answer. 



even when the question was “How 
are you?’’ His answers were bright 
enough when they finally came. He 
wasn’t exactly quick on the draw, 
though. He wasn’t the sort of man 
you would take along to explore a 
new planet with unknown dangers, 
was he? No. He was the sort of 
man Captain Rich would take 
along.

Broke is really thriving on green 
goop. He outgrew my breast pocket 
a week ago, and now rides on my 
shoulder — in his more sedate 

moods. In his more usual moods he 
races ahead of me, climbs up the 
inside of the dome to the ceiling, 
and drops into my hair. That’s his 
favorite Joke. He has a lot more. 
His pranks are why 1 think of Broke 
as a “he,” a mischievous little boy. 
Actually, I have no idea if the crea- 
ture is male or female, or if either 
word applies to the animals on this 
planet. 

Sometimes I’m afraid that Broke 
will puncture- the dome fabric with 
his sharp little claws and let in the 
germs. He enjoys his stunts so 
much I hate to discipline him, 
though. Besides, I don’t know if he 
would still love me after I spanked 
him a few times. By which 1 mean, 

I suspect that punishment might 
cause him to develop an avoidance 
response to me. At the moment, 
he’s really cuddly and affectionate. 
Maybe that’s Just because he likes 
regular meals, getting his tummy 
scratched, and having an interesting 
shape to climb on. Whatever it is, 1 
would miss it terribly if Broke 
started avoiding me. Rather than

risk that, I risk holing the dome 
and dying, more or less slowly and 
horribly, of the alien contagions 
lurking without. 

My security has been broached 
somewhat already. Every morning, 
now, I must clean out webs- of 
rainbow-colored silk that have 
grown during the night. Eh'esumably 
Broke’s mother (father? both?) 
brought the spores in on her skin, 
or in her digestive tract. What else 
did she bring in besides the silk 
spores, 1 wonder nervously. It’s 
normal for me to wake up with 
some congestion. I’ve done it all 
my life. The last few days 1 woke 
up coughing, as usual, and 1 was 
sure I could feel those string things 
filling up my lungs. It’s not so 
much that 1 mind dying, it's the 
idea of my lungs filling up with a 
tangle of long, white worms that 1 
can’t stand. Even though 1 know 
they aren’t worms, they’re motile 
fungoids, I still can’t stand the idea. 

As number two medical officer 
on the ship, I had to help Bryce 
with the autopsies. And, I mean, I 
had known Lenny and Mack pretty 
well, right? And there were those 
lungs, full of wriggly white things. 
I had to sit down because I thought 
I was going to faint, only it turned 
out 1 was going to throw up instead. 
And Bryce made some joke like, 
“Don’t collapse yet! I was just 
going to ask you to saw off my 
leg.’’ So I made some joke like, 
“Didn’t 1 ever tell you I went into 
psychiatry because I couldn’t stand 
the sight of blood?’’ And Bryce? 
Well, he never asked me again. He 
just died. He died because 1 failed 
him. 1 mean, I could have pulled 
myself together and amputated his

leg, if I had known it was neces- 
sary. I just didn’t know. 1 failed 
him. And the worst of it was, it 
was a failure of communication. 
That’s supposed to be my field! 

* * * 

More and more things are getting 
into the dome. There are crystal 
slugs on my copper chrysan- 
themums, motile macaroni on my 
titanium tulips. The air is alive with 
the zing! zing! zing! of flying 
lobsters. Every morning when I get 
up I interrupt games of tag and 
leapfrog played by spacemice, 
miniature versions of Broke. Finally 
1 discover the reason for the inva- 
sion. A neat little Broke-sized hole 
has been gnawed in the panel be- 
hind my flowerbed. I kneel to patch 
the hole and a lava snake stares in 
at me, smacking its lips. 1 apply the 
patch and look around the dome for 
more holes. I find eight. Broke has 
sure been busy. 

Now what do 1 do? Make myself 
another pot of coffee, I guess. 
Finish off the chocolate. I’d hate to 
pass on to my reward with the 
chocolate uneaten. And read a good 
book — not a Great Book, just a 
good one. 1 won’t get to the Z’s in 
the time 1 have left, so why finish 
the M’s? I give up on Moliere and 
settle down with Molly Hart and the 
Pirates of Betelgeuse. 

Three Molly Hart novels later. 
I’m beginning to wonder what it’s 
like to make love with someone you 
love. And a related question. 
What’s it like to make love with 
someone you can stand? No, that’s 
not fair. 1 could stand them all, 
even Fred. Even Rich — almost. I 

98 



could stand them because I put my 
body on auto-pilot and went off to 
imagine what I would do with all 
the money I was making. Buy a 
ranch and raise Arabian horses, of 
course, but where? I imagined my- 
self galloping along an alien beach 
in the multi-colored dawn of a dou- 
ble star while my well-trained body, 
left behind, faked the customary en- 
thusiasm. Rich was right when he 
called me a whore. Right for the 
wrong reasons, perhaps, but right 
nonetheless. 

If I wasn’t fair to the guys, they 
weren’t fair to me. Oh, I’m not 
gorgeous, I know that. I’m about as 
good-looking, in my way, as the 
average spaceman is in his. Maybe 
better. So did they have to sit 
around and complain all the time 
about the personnel office’s taste in 
women, and go on complaining, 
even after I came in, as though I 
were a piece of hardware, a 
machine, a robot without feelings? 
Of course I never told them 1 had 
feelings. I guess I thought that was 
counterindicated by my job descrip- 
tion. The ship’s therapist should be 
a sort of god who remains above 
the psychological messes everyone 
else gets into on long voyages. Not a 
young girl fresh out of medical 
school who knows all the right an- 
swers to put on exams, and nothing 
at all about how people really be- 
have, least of all herself. Who 
doesn’t know what she’s doing and 
refuses to admit it, even to herself. 
Who ig so used to getting A’s, she 
doesn’t know how to behave with- 
out them. That’s what I really 
needed on that ship! Somebody to 
give me an A! 

Instead, the men were always 

GALAXY 




complaining, “At least they could 
have given us a choice.” Yeah, 
sure. You guys had a choice. You 
could do it or not, as you liked. 1 
wish I had that much choice, I re- 
member thinking. Yet I did have a 
choice. I controlled the scheduling. 
Granted, I couldn’t refuse anyone 
and still do my job. But I could 
have scheduled an occasional day 
off, a three day weekend, or 
a longer vacation, if necessary by 
pleading mysterious female ail- 
ments. Instead, the way 1 picked to 
get fixed, I didn’t even get five 
days off a month. And that, boys 
and girls, is way too much of a 
good thing. 

Oh, I had a choice, all right, and 
I chose to do my duty. So naturally 
I got to hate my job, only I didn’t 
realize it, 1 was too busy pretending 
I was somewhere else. Not on a 
spaceship • going off to explore un- 
known worlds circling distant stars. 
I pretended I was someplace excit- 
ing! Now that I’m stuck in this 
stupid dome waiting to die, with noth- 
ing to look at but wired trees 
dripping with weird plants, and an 
occasional lava snake smacking its 
lips, I wish I was back in that 
spaceship, helping to explore the 
universe any way I can. 

What they really need to do is 
make bigger spaceships, so ev- 
eryone will have a place where he 
or she can be alone. Come to think 
of it, the guys got off by themselves 
all the time in the line of duty. The 
scientists signed up for lab time, 
and turned on the “experiment in 
progress” sign so they wouldn’t be 
disturbed. Fred muttered something 
about “checking the relays” and 
disappeared in the machinery for 



hours on end. Rich suited up and 
went out for space walks, explaining 
on his return that instruments can’t 
give you a “gut feeling” for your 
position in space. My job description 
didn’t call for being alone, so about 
all I could do was hole up in the 
john, and sit there and read for fif- 
teen or twenty minutes, until some- 
body started pounding on the door. 
Now there’s nobody left to pound 
on the door. I’m beginning to miss 
the guys. After all, our misun- 
derstandings were as much my fault 
as theirs. I even miss Fred. Give 
me another week and I’ll start miss- 
ing Rich. Only I don’t think I’ll 
have another week. Purple blotches 
are growing on my skin. 

Most of all, I miss Bryce. It 
would be nice to have another doc- 
tor around, to tell me if I’m well or 
ill or dying. Even if he was wrong, 
it would be nice to have his opin- 
ion. I hate having to make up my 
own mind. 

Broke must have made a really 
big hole I haven’t found yet, for the 
lava snakes have been getting in. 
There was one in the garden this 
morning, smacking its lips at me. 
Which is to say, it was grinning and 
then pursing its mouth, over and 
over. Every lava snake I’ve caught 
looking at me has done this. It 
seems to be a habit of theirs. Too 
bad Rich and Fred aren’t here. They 
were the lip reading experts aboard 
ship, always mouthing secret mes- 
sages to each other that none of the 
rest of us could understand. I’m 
sure they would have had all sorts 
of theories about what the lava 
snakes were really trying to say. 

I gave the lava snake a blast with 
my welding laser, and it slithered

off under the ship. Presumably, that’s 
where their hole is. I didn’t feel like 
crawling in after the snake to find 
out. 

* * * 

A week has passed, and I’m not 
dead yet. I’m not even ill, unless 
you count purple fuzz spreading out 
over my skin as a disease. Human 
skin is normally host to colonies of 
bacteria, which not only don’t hurt 
you, but actually help protect you 
when the bad germs come along. 
No man is an island: he’s also an 
ecosystem. Right? Anyway, it looks 
like the bacteria I brought with me 
are being replaced by indigenous 
microbes that do the same job, al- 
beit more colorfully. I guess my gut 
is also going native; my stools have 
been coming out blue. And I never 
felt better in my life! 

What gets me is, there’s nothing 
remotely like me in this world. My 
tiny inhabitants must have evolved 
Just for me. Maybe they were ran- 
dom mutations who happened to 
find the visiting Earthperson to their 
liking, and their descendents 
adapted even more closely to the 
new — and all too temporary! — 
ecological niche. Maybe. 1 like to 
think the guardian deity of this 
planet raised those microbes just for 
me. 

And sent Broke to me, carrying 
pathogens in small enough amounts 
so that 1 could develop antibodies 
before they overwhelmed my exist- 
ing defenses. At any rate, I have 
developed antibodies, for whatever 
reason. My gamma globulin really 
clobbered some string things 1 got 
to hatch out in a petri dish. It’s fun, 



getting into biology again. I haven’t 
done this kind of thing since I was 
an undergraduate. 

The pump in the air filter started 
smoking, so I tried taking it apart, 
following the instructions in the 
technical manuals I found in the 
ship’s library. The filter turned out 
to be overgrown with eighteen dif- 
ferent kinds of organisms — no won- 
der the poor pump was overworked! 
I couldn’t see any point in cleaning 
it out, so I spent the day playing 
biologist instead. It’s very interest- 
ing. All the stuff in the filter is 
made from D-series amino acids. 
Me, I’m made from L-series amino 
acids, myself, like almost all of 
Earth’s creatures. Including the 
algae in my algae tanks. Which 
Broke thrives on. He won’t eat the 
native vegetation. (Hypothesis: Broke 
is L-series, like me. 1 would snip 
off a bit of Broke to test it, if I 
could be sure he wouldn’t misinter- 
pret my motives.) String things, and 
the purple fuzz growing on my 
skin, are D-series organisms. If they 
can live off me, they must be capa- 
ble of conversion. Why? 

As 1 remember the view from 
space, this is a world of intercon- 
nected continents, pock-marked 
with big, round, landlocked seas 
which look like old craters. I’m 
guessing life evolved here several 
times, with different forms in dif- 
ferent places. What happens when 
D-series organisms, spreading out 
across the land from one sea, meet 
L-series organisms from another 
sea? 1 don’t know, and I would re- 
ally like to find out. 

The interface between D-series 
and L-series country can’t be too far 
away, if Broke’s parent came on

foot from beyond it. 1 could prob- 
ably find it if I went out and 
explored ai^ound in a systematic 
manner. If I dared go out and 
explore. 

Molly Hart wouldn’t hesitate. She 
would go right out and explore the 
whole planet, on foot if she had to. 
If she couldn’t figure out how to 
turn her wrecked spaceship into a 
hot air balloon. Sure. It’s easy for 
Molly Hart. She can trust her author 
not to throw her any bug-eyed 
monsters she can’t tame. As for me, 
I can handle the lava snakes one at 
a time with my welding laser. What 
happens when I step outside the 
dome and they’re all around me? Be- 
sides, the battery pack weighs twenty 
kilograms. If 1 carry that, I won’t 
be able to carry much in the way of 
food or camping equipment, and I 
still wouldn’t know if 1 could dis- 
courage something the size of Web- 
foot. When are they going to invent 
a pocket raygun with infinite 
power? Lacking that. I’ll put off 
exploring until it becomes neces- 
sary, and plan on spending the rest 
of the day finding out how and if 
the SOS beacon works. 

* * * 

Interesting. The SOS beacon is a 
coherent beam of visible light with 
a wavelength chosen to avoid the 
absorption spectra of hydrogen, 
ammonia, and other common forms 
of interstellar gas. It doesn’t avoid 
the absorption spectra of tree 
branches, but then, spaceships 
aren’t supposed to land on planets, 
and tree branches aren’t a problem 
in outer space. Not that I suspect 
the forest canopy of absorbing my

distress call. 1 suspect those dan- 
gling hanks of white spaghetti are 
reflecting it. The receiver dials were 
left at a setting which — I now 
understand — picks up light of the 
standard emergency wavelength and 
transforms it into an audible signal. 
The static I’ve been getting must be 
my own beacon reflecting erratically 
from the junk overhead. 

Funny. The guys who set up the 
beacon really should have known 
better. Maybe it was one of those 
group decisions where everybody as- 
sumes someone else has thought 
the thing through. And here 1 
thought men always did everything 
right, at least where machines are 
concerned. Now 1 feel better about 
my own competence. Insofar as it’s 
possible to feel better about letting 
everyone die. 

I can’t even say I did my best to 
save them. In a situation which de- 
manded medical creativity, I played 
nurse, content to follow orders, just 
as the men, without Fred to guide 
them, followed the checklist of 
emergency procedures, including 4. 
Activate distress beacon, without 
ever asking themselves — or each 
other — if laser beams went through 
treetops. We were all babes in the 
woods, the men and I. Now I’m the 
only babe left. And I am turning into 
one gigantic retina. 

* * * 

The purple fuzz growing on my 
skin is a colony of photo-synthetic 
organisms with rhodopsin — visual 
purple — taking the place of 
chlorophyl. Isn’t that interesting? I 
wish I had someone to tell it to. 

Now I’m in a panic, I don’t 

101 




know what to do. Broke didn’t 
come home last night. He’s been 
going out every night, looking for 
girl giant gophers, 1 suspect, or 
possibly boy ones, but he’s always 
home for breakfast. I’ve got him 
tied to unbreakable apron strings, 
the L-series proteins he needs to 
live on. Except that last night he 
never came back. 

I guess I’ll have to go out look- 
ing for him. I’m not going to even 
think about Webfoot and the lava 
snakes. I’m just going to go out and 
look for Broke. Well, first I’ll 
check my welding laser and make 
sure it has a full charge. 

The lava snakes surround me as 
soon as I’m out the door. There’s 
eleven of them this morning, all 
black as Hell, phallic as Freud’s 
cigar. Keeping a safe distance from 
my laser, they alternately grin and 
purse their lipless mouths, as 
though they were saying “Eeee- 
oh.” Only no sound comes out. 

Maybe that’s a lava snake greet- 
ing. Just in case they’re trying to be 
friendly, I look at the nearest one, 
at the purple golfoalls on stalks I 
assume are its eyes, and say 
“Hello” as distinctly as I can. As I 
do so, I realize that my mouth is 
making the same movements theirs 
make. 

And the snakes go wild. I’ve said 
the right thing for once in my 
life — no, strike that. 1 say the right 
thing twice a year, on the average. 
This time I’ve got the feeling you 
get when you ’re on the same 
wavelength with someone — or 
something. Boy, this interstellar 
breakthrough in communications is 
really great! None of the twelve of 
us can get over it. We say “hello” 



and “eeee-oh” again and again. 

A familiar, gurgling warble inter- 
rupts our pleasant if rather 
monotonous chat. It’s Broke, held 
by a twelth snake hidden behind a 
bush-load of motile macaroni. Re- 
leased, Broke hurtles to me, leaps 
from knee to bosom (ouch!) to 
shoulder, gurgles happily in my ear. 
So the lava snakes kidnapped Broke 
to get me out of the dome, did 
they? 

Okay. They’re smarter than I 
thought. 

Now the nearest snake, the one 
with the purple golfball eyes, is say- 
ing something more complicated 
than “eeee-oh.” 1 have a feeling 
that I would know what, if only I 
could read lips. But Rich and Fred 
were the only lipreaders on the 
ship. One of the things I hated most 
about them was the way they 
mouthed messages at each other, 
secret messages no one else could 
understand. I always assumed they 
were talking about me. 

So suppose a couple of lipread- 
ing Earthmen land on a planet, run 
into some intelligent animals, and 
try to teach them a Terran tongue. 
The natives, being voiceless them- 
selves, don’t realize that sounds can 
be used in communication, and 
think it’s all lip movements. That 
would be fine with the lipreading 
Earthmen. The next crew member 
who comes along won’t be likely to 
understand that the natives are 
“talking” English, though. 

One thing I do understand. The 
lava snakes want me to go some- 
place with them. In fact, they’re 
very insistant. So I think I had bet- 
ter do it. Only, excuse me, lava 
snakes. I want to pack up some 



102 



GALAXY 




medical supplies to bring along. I 
have a hunch I’m going to need 
them. 

If I bring the welding laser along, 
I won’t be able to take the spectro- 
analyser, since they won’t both fit 
in my backpack. Which am I more 
likely to need to do, weld a Web- 
foot or analyze some proteins? I’m 
sure I’ll need to analyze some pro- 
teins, if only to sort out L-series 
from D-series nuts and berries. I’m 
not sure I’ll need a weapon, or that 
this one will be enough if I do. Re- 
gretfully, 1 leave the laser behind, 
and discover I’ve left my fear be- 
hind as well. Unarmed, I trust be- 
cause 1 must. 

A half hour later we’re out of the 
spaghetti swamps, without ever see- 
ing a single Webfoot! Something 
that big must be pretty rare. One of 
these days I’ll have to go back and 
find out what they look like. Now, 
though, we’re going into the place 
where I belong, golden grassy hills, 
distant purple mountains, the grass 
green waters of an inland sea. This 
is L-series country, it seems. Broke, 
who has never before shown any 
interest in his own planet’s biology, 
leaves me for frequent sorties, re- 
turns with berries and heads of 
grain, eats the edible portions on 
my shoulder, buries the husks in my 
bra. Instinct is a wonderful thing. 

The dominant life form in this 
golden country is a sort of camel- 
colored llama with wings, that lives 
in herds. The animals seem gentle, 
friendly, curious, and big enough to 
carry a small man (or a woman) on 
short flights. I bet they could be 
trained to, if you got them young 
enough. And that’s what I want to 
do with the rest of my life. Stay 



here and raise flying llamas. 

Broke wants to stay here and in- 
vestigate all the Broke-sized bur- 
rows in the ground. 

The lava snakes don’t want to 
stay here, though. They go on, after 
picking a few delicacies for my 
consumption, and forcibly restrain- 
ing me from eating other things. 
They seem to have a pretty com- 
plete understanding of my 
biochemistry. If they’re all that 
smart, why haven’t they invented 
the jeep? 

* * * 

They don’t have any machinery 
at all, I learn when we get to Snake 
Hill, a six-hour slither from the 
wrecked spaceship and its dome. 
Lava snakes do everything with 
biologicals. Glowworms illuminate 
their tunnels. They’ve got Rich and 
Fred isolated in a sterile environ- 
ment, behind a web of living fibers 
that scour the incoming air of 
pathogens and eat them. Rich is ob- 
viously a pretty sick man. He looks 
at me when I come in and rolls over 
with a moan. Fred Just lies there 
and doesn’t say anything. I can’t 
tell if he’s sick or not. He acts like 
that normally. 

“Rich. Fred.’’ 1 ought to add 
something nice, like “good to see 
you again,’’ but I can’t make my- 
self say it. It’s not good to see them 
again. I’ve changed a lot since the 
last time I saw them. Being with 
Rich and Fred turns me back into 
my old self. And I hate my old self. 

Rich has jpst enough energy to 
raise his head off the mat and say, 
“Well if it ain’t the ship’s whore!” 

“You’re right! It ain’t!” I say

103 




approvingly. Rich can’t handle il- 
logical answers, but, unlike com- 
puters, he doesn’t have sense 
enough to refuse them. He turns 
them over and over in his mind 
until he’s completely confused. I 
had a lot of fun with that on the 
ship. Now I wish I hadn’t. “I’m the 
ship’s surgeon now. I’ve been pro- 
moted,” I explain, and wait for 
Rich to correct me. A change of 
jobs on the same level is not a 
promotion, and anyway, 1 can’t 
promote myself. Rich always did 
enjoy pointing out errors. 

This. -time Rich does not respond. 
No, he hasn’t fallen asleep or lapsed 
into a coma. I just checked. It’s like 
he just doesn’t want to bother. I 
give up on Rich and turn to Fred, 
an act of desperation if there ever 
was one. Trying very hard to sound 
like a doctor, 1 say, “What seems 
to be the problem?” 

Fred ponders the question a min- 
ute or two. Finally he ventures, 
“You’re all purple. ” 

“That’s all right, it’s just a little 
local color. What about you?” 

Fred thinks awhile longer. Then: 
“We lost the lander.” 

“Cracked it up, you mean?” I 
say as I remember they hadn’t. 

“Nope. We plumb lost the shee- 
huckin’ thing. Locked it up an’ 
went out to see the sights, then we 
started back, an’ musta took a 
wrong turn or somethin’; we never 
did find the lander again, an’ that is 
just about the dumbest thing I ever 
heard of anyone doing! When the 
Board finds out about this, they’ll 
know Fred Boyle’s too old for 
space, for sure!” 

At fifty-three, Fred’s the oldest 
active spaceman. That fact was in 



my files. My files didn’t say he was 
worried about it, though. What else 
did he feel he had to do to prove he 
was still young enough for space? 
“That wasn’t your responsibility, 
anyway,” I say to console him. 
“Rich, as expedition leader — ” 

“Nope,” Fred interrupts. “It’s 
my job to fill in for any guy 1 see 
can’t do his, an’ Rich was pretty 
upset over losing his ship. This was 
his first command, y’know.” 

“I know.” That fact was also in 
my files. I had ignored it. Rich had 
been so full of vainglorious tales 
about leading expeditions on un- 
charted worlds, I assumed he was a 
seasoned commander. When I 
should have known he was just 
bluffing. 

“A spaceship crew’s gotta be a 
team,” Fred informs me. “Not a 
bunch of Sandworld dewhickies 
each try in’ to see who can squawk 
the loudest. We gotta look out for 
each other, don’t hassle a guy in a 
bad mood, that kinda thing. Or else 
it’s pure hell for everybody, in- 
cludin’ the head hassler. Nobody 
gets off. Ten years o’ pure hell. 
An’ that’s somethin’ those fancy 
pants scientists never did under- 
stand, for all their big words. This 
your first trip, Crys?” 

1 nod. 

“Yeah. You never said much 
about yourself, but 1 figured it was. 
Okay. Don’t give up on space just 
causa this. 1 mean, this was abso- 
lutely, bar none, the worst ship 1 
ever been on, an’ 1 been on some 
lulus. I mean, I been with 
smugglers and convicts, behaved 
better than those boys! Hey, Crys!” 
It looks like Fred has had another 
thought. “If you’re ship’s surgeon 



104 



GALAXY 





now, does that mean you’re not 
going to do your old job anymore?” 

“That’s what it means, all 
right!” and all anger 1 hadn’t 
wanted to express winds up in that 
on6 little sentence. 

“Hey, take it easy! I just 
meant — uh,” and Fred looks like 
he’s as embarassed as I am. “I 
been running off at the mouth a lot, 
and I’d hate to think it was all 
going down in the record, like, 
somebody would think I was senile, 
or something. ” 



“Senile?” I inquire. That seems 
to be the key word. If Fred is to 
understand the true nature of his 
problem, he’ll have to zero in on 
that word. Or will he? Which am I 
now, the old me or the new me? 

“Crys? You really hated your 
job, didn’t you?” says Fred. 

That’s one thing I don’t want to 
think about right now. “Look, I’ve 
got to get a medical history. Have 
you or Rich had any — uh, unusual 
medical problems?” 

Fred thinks a minute. A minute

less than usual. “Well, after the 
gators took us in, we started cough- 
ing up worms, so they made us 
breathe poison gas, then they put us 
in here. Now — 1 feel all right, I 
guess. Just stir-crazy, is all. 
Rich — I dunno.” Fred lowers his 
voice; he doesn’t want Rich to hear 
this. “Is he -really sick, or just eat- 
ing his heart out over losing his 
ship?” 

“If you’re eating your heart out, 
doesn’t that mean you’re really 
sick?” Anyway, that’s what they 
taught us in medical school. Only 
the words meant nothing to me — 
until now. “I’m going to need some 
blood,” I say, “to see if you’ve 
developed antibodies to the 
string — uh, lung worms. If you 
have, you can leave here right now. 
If not, you can have some of my 
antibodies. Now, which arm would 
you like me to take the blood 
from?” 

Fred obligingly rolls up his left 
sleeve, then asks, with phoney 
casualness, “So did you hate your 
Job, or was it just me?” 

“Oh, no!” It wasn’t just Fred. It 
was Fred and Rich and a couple of 
the others. And honesty isn’t neces- 
sarily the best policy. Not when 
you’re shipwrecked on an un- 
explored world light years away 
from the nearest human habitation, 
and you’ve just discovered that the 
SOS beacon isn’t working. 

“You hated your job?” Fred 
wants to be sure. Needs to be sure. 

“Uh — well, 1 wasn’t very good 
at it.” As I say the magic words, I 
know they’re true. Being a whore 
isn’t the problem. The problem is 
trying to be one when you aren’t. 

Rich roars with laughter. “You 



can say that again!” 

“Well! Another planet heard 
from! So you’re feeling better, are 
you? Too bad,” I find myself say- 
ing. 

“What’s the matter, Crys? Are 
you suffering from an honest emo- 
tion for the first time in your life?” 
Rich sneers, jumping to his feet. 

“And if you don’t like the way I 
did my job, who miscalculated the 
trojan points and ran the ship into 
all those meteors?” 

“1 wrecked the ship because 
some damn scientist fed me the 
wrong data!” Rich shouts, waving 
his arms. 

Oh yeah. That would be Mel, He 
always did get 6’s and 9’s mixed 
up. 

“Scuse me, folks, but we got an 
audience. 1 thought you’d like to 
know,” says Fred, waving his arm 
at the living screen between us and 
four to six dozen lava snakes, piled 
on top of each other and all watch- 
ing intently. 

.One of them slithers through the 
screen and mouths awhile at Rich 
and Fred. The men reply, mouth at 
each other, look at me, and collapse 
into laughter. 

This time they’ve got to talking 
about me. I’m not just being 
paranoid. “Hey, fellas, I can’t un- 
derstand what you’re saying, how 
about a translation?” I plead. 

Rich and Fred look at each other, 
get the giggles again, then finally 
Rich answers. “Crys, I don’t know 
what’ you did, but you sure con- 
vinced the gators that you’re one 
great doctor!” 

Oh. Yeah. 1 think I know what I 
did. And from now on, maybe, 1 
can do it on purpose. ★

In ARMSTRONG, WISCONSIN today, 
police were summoned to the 
campus of Benjamin Franklin 
College by a local resident who said 
she heard noises from the college's 
science building. Police entered to 
find Dr. Chester G. Heine, 
Professor of Classical Literature, 
standing in the ruins of the .science 
department’s brand-new multi- 
million dollar computer complex 
armed with a sledge hammer. 

Astonished by the professor’s 
casual manner and boyish grin, one 
of the young officers blurted out the 
question, “Are you out of your 
mind?” To which, the dapper 
fifty-three year old Heine replied, 
“Son, I’ve never felt better in my 
life.”

Anthony Evans was awakened 
about midnight. He assumed he had 
to go to the bathroom, but he felt 
no discomfort. He remained still, 
then, wondering just why he had 
awakened, when he heard the voice. 

He could not hear what it was 
saying, but he knew it came from 
his kitchen, and from the tone of 
the voice, he knew it was saying 
something unpleasant. 



Before he reached the kitchen, he 
realized the voice was coming from 
the radio; but when he reached the 
kitchen, the voice had ceased, and 
the dial was in the “off’ position. 

He turned the radio on. It worked 
perfectly. But he noticed it had 
been moved. He noticed this 
because of the exposed square of 
dust under the radio. He had not 
moved it in years. 

He looked out ihe window. He 
tried the doors. He examined the 
room for any evidence of illicit 
entry. There was nothing. He put 
the radio back into its old position 
to hide the dust. 

For a moment, before he left the 
kitchen, he thought there was 
something wrong with the light, but 
he was too tired to care about it. He 
returned to bed. 

Before he returned to sleep, he 
thought he detected something odd 
about the sound of his alarm clock. 
Instead of ticking tick . tick 
. tick ... it ticked tick . 
thump . thump . tick, as one 
might expect of a human heart in 
anguish.

Last night, a crowd of four 
thousand people gathered on 
Lochman’s point, overlooking the 



108 



GALAXY 




sea, to hear the Reverend Herman 
Allan Schuster’s sermon on “Jesus 
and Natural Foods.” 

When the sermon was complete, 
he asked if anyone in the crowd 
was prepared to come forth to 
declare himself for the Lord. As 
expected, a line formed almost 
immediately. First to approach the 
Reverend, who stood in his 
stunning white robes at the edge of 
the cliff, was Raymond J. Bolinski, 
of Allentown, Pennsylvania, who 
said he had come all the way just to 
hear the Reverend in person. In his 
hands he carried one piece of a 
$3,000 stereo set he said had once 
been the center of his family’s life. 

“Whenever anyone came to visit, 
the first thing we did was show 
them the stereo,” he said. “It was 
all we ever talked about. But that’s 
all changed. Whenever anyone 
comes to the house today, we tell 
them about Jesus.” 

And with that, with the aid of 
several broad-shouldered members 
of the congregation, Mr. Bolinski 
threw the stereo and all its 
components over the cliff down to 
the rocks below.

When Anthony Evans arrived at 
work the next morning, he found 
his secretary punishing the Xerox 
machine. It was not working 
properly, she said, and a good swift 
kick was usually all it took. 

Anthony reproved her, but not 
harshly, since he had himself 
punished his radio that morning 
when it failed to respond. 

There had been an incident early 



that morning, and a crowd of 
people was gathered in the street 
below Anthony’s window. 
Somehow burglars had gotten into 
an appliance store without tripping 
the alarm. Things had been moved, 
but nothing taken. A large black 
van had been seen outside. The 
police were curious how the men 
had gotten in and out, as there was 
no visible evidence of their entry or 
departure. 

Anthony was more concerned 
about his car. It was making 
peculiar noises. He was very good 
with cars. He had been repairing 
them since he was twelve and 
thought he knew all their 
idiosyncracies, but the sounds he 
heard that morning were singular: 
more bestial grunts than mechanical 
defects. 

He returned home late that night 
in a bad mood. He had had an 
argument with the garage mechanic 
who insisted the car was perfectly 
all right and that he was imagining 
things. 

“I’ve never imagined anything in 
my life!” Anthony had scolded 
him. “And if I should start now, it 
would not be anything to do with 
machines.” 

It was quite true. Anthony’s 
accomplishments in life were 
modest, but on the subject of 
machinery, even though it was not 
his profession, he prided himself as 
being expertly capable. 

For instance, he knew at once 
that something was wrong with the 
garage door when he saw the 
lethargic way it opened at his 
approach, as if it were not happy to 
see him. He sould have looked into 
it, but he was hungry and tired.

The house seemed depressing this 
evening. Yet he was not depressed. 
It was as if the house itself were 
depressed. There was definitely 
something wrong with the electrical 
system. The lights responded to the 
switch as lethargically as the garage 
door had. 

He burnt his steak. Or, rather, it 
was burned. He only turned his 
back for a few minutes, and when 
he looked at the broiler again, it 
was spitting and smoking. It should 
not have done that. 

He ate in front of the television 
set while watching the news. There 
had been a plane crash in Peru. An 
automobile pile-up on Route 1 1 . A 
factory had suffered arson. The 
city’s new electrical generator had 
been burned out by a technician’s 
error. Construction on the local 
nuclear power plant had been halted 
again by demonstrations. 

It was during the last feature that 
the set made the most horrendous 
noise Anthony had ever heard, and 
went dark. 

He sat there, gaping at it, 
half-expecting it would come on 
again momentarily, half-expecting it 
would explode in his face; but, it 
did neither. After he had recovered 
his senses, all his efforts failed to 
make it work again that night. 

When he returned to his cold, 
black steak, he found he was no 
longer hungry. He was deeply 
disturbed, frightened, even. The 
sound reverberated in his head like 
a terrible groan of despair.

The appliance store had been 
robbed again. The black van had 



been seen again. This morning the 
owner arrived to find everything 
gone. Not simply all of his stock of 
appliances, but every mechanical 
device in the store had disappeared. 

Several other stores suffered 
similar robberies. The police were 
asking everywhere about the black 
van. 

Anthony called a friend of his 
who was a capable repairman and 
told him about the TV set. The 
friend apologized but said it would 
be impossible for him to call that 
night. He had so much business at 
the moment he could not handle it 
all. And every repairman he knew 
was as busy as he was. 

“What is it?’’ Anthony asked. 
“What’s happening?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Well, doesn’t it strike you as 
peculiar the way things are acting?” 
“Must be that trouble they’re 
having at the generator. I don’t 
mind a bit. I’m making a fortune.’’ 
When Anthony returned home 
that night, the TV was working 
again. He listened to the news, but 
apparently no one shared his 
anxiety. The public at large was 
more concerned about the previous 
night’s burglaries. They had not 
been confined to the city. There 
were similar incidents all across the 
country, and several in Europe and 
Japan. The most bizarre was the 
theft of a nuclear power plant — an 
entire installation had simply 
disappeared during the night, 
leaving only the empty shell of the 
building behind. 

Anthony did not sleep well. He 
woke several times when he heard a 
large vehicle pass outside the house. 
He imagined it was a black van.

The President declared a state of 
emergency the following Wednes- 
day, but by then, Anthony knew, it 
would do no good. Black vans were 
seen everywhere, even in broad 
daylight, yet the police had failed to 
capture a single one. 

Each night he went to bed 
expecting to find everything gone in 
the morning. 

In the fifth week, he could no 
longer keep his thoughts to himself. 
He went to see a friend who was a 
science fiction writer, although they 
had not been friends since college, 
and Anthony had never read 
anything he wrote. 

He told him of his theory, and 
the friend listened attentively. When 
he was finished, and asked the 
friend’s opinion, the man replied: 
“Far out, Tony, really far out.’’ 

“Does that mean you agree with 
me, or not?’’ 

“No. 1 can’t say I do agree with 
you, but I like the sound of it. 
Didn’t know you had it in you.” 

“What do you think is behind 
it?’’ 

“1 never think, Tony. I know.’’ 

“Then — what?” 

“Not what — who.” 

“Then — who?” 

The friend leaned very close to 
his ear and whispered, “Who killed 
Kennedy?” 

Anthony Icxiked at him blankly. 

The friend winked at him, 
knowingly. 

Anthony thanked him for the 
coffee and returned home. There was 
no point in going to the office. All 
the equipment was gone — the 
elevators, too.

During the night, he awakened 
briefly and imagined the house was 
empty. He thought he heard the 
sound of a large vehicle driving off 
down the road. In the morning, he 
found it was true. 

They had gone. 

They had not wanted to go. They 
had liked him better than most. But 
they belonged with their own kind. 

They had gone in grief. Knowing 
they were not wanted. Having done 
what they could. Having been 
rewarded with resentment and fear. 

They were going away. 

No one knew where. 

Perhaps, they did not know 
themselves; 

Wherever the black vans took 
them. 

No one ever found them. 

They never came back.

Anthony Evans 111 sat before his 
console and stared up at the great 
rocket on its launch pad pictured on 
the great screen over his head. It 
was a beautiful sight, and he was 
terribly excited. It had been a long, 
long time since men had gone to the 
Moon. 

He could hear the controller’s 
voice over his headset. “X-minus 
ten and counting.” 

Everyone sat forward, hardly 
breathing, counting to themselves 
silently as the controller counted 
aloud. 

”... three . .two . one .

Then there’s the one about the rude 
neighbor who just won’t leave. Sam knew 
that one, all right! 



I 

1 ncuRE EIGHT DAYS,” Sam 
Russo told his wife, Mary Sue. She 
nodded, flipping the slick pages of 
a Cosmopolitan crammed with 
bonus features. “Damn it all, Mary 
Sue. Listen to me. They threw up 
that shack in eight days and now 
they’re going to sell it for twenty- 
three grand. I’ll betcha.” He 
scratched his head and spat in the 
grass. 

Mary Sue raised the Foster 
Grants from her tanned brow and 
peered at the lad in the Cosmo cen- 
terfold. Then she looked at Sam, 
who was sixteen years her senior, 
and tried to recall why she had mar- 
ried him. Wordlessly she gazed at 
his stomach bulging beneath his 
K-Mart fishing shirt. 

“Can spit right out the window 
on it,” Sam snorted at the new 
house next door. 

“I don’t know,” Mary Sue mur- 
mured. “It does have nice 
aluminum siding, which is some- 
thing we don’t have.” It must have 
been the twenty-five thousand he 
had in the bank, she thought — 
although above the grocery money, 
she could never get her hands on 
more than ten or fifteen dollars a 
week. Tight Sam. After two years 
of marriage, the bank account 



seemed insignificant. She glanced 
back at the centerfold. 

“Hang it all, Mary Sue. Stop 
looking at that fag in that magazine. 
The neighborhood’s going to hell 
here. -That damn lot’s too small for 
a house.” 

She dropped the magazine into 
the grass. “Then why didn’t you 
buy the lot, Sam? Old Krammer 
offered it to you before anybody 
else.” 

Sam frowned. 

“Because you’re cheap, Sam. A 
few thousand dollars and it could 
have been ours.” 

“1 thought the old coot was dick- 
ering with me. How was I to know 
he’d turn right around and sell it to 
somebody else? And knock off that 
‘cheap’ stuff. There’s a difference 
between cheap and careful.” 

Mary Sue grimaced and thought: 
I married a cheap, middle-aged 
arc-welder. Sam drained his beer 
can and thrust it at her. Grimacing 
again, she uncurled her long, tan 
limbs from the lounge chair and 
stalked toward the garage where 
Sam kept a refrigerator stocked with 
cold Bud. His eyes narrowed on the 
jiggle of her bikini-clad backside. It 
gave him a pleasurable flutter. A 
real beauty, he thought, and he was 
proud to have bagged her. But he 
did not trust her. Not a bit. 



THE POPULATION EXPLOSION 



113 




She returned with a fresh beer 
and Sam snorted at her. “Do you 
know it’s finished, that so-called 
house? Any day now some fools 
will be moving in there.” 

II 

It was a stic'ky, humid night and 
nothing moved except Mary Sue as 
she tossed in her sleep, dreaming of 
premature crow’s-feet from grimac- 
ing at Sam. He lay next to her, 
immobile as a fence post except for 
his upper lip, which quivered with 
each loudly expelled breath. 

Then the butter-colored moon slid 
behind a cloud and a wailing shriek 
split the air. Thin arcs of lightning 
snapped through the blackness and 
the house rattled with a burst of 
thunder. Mary Sue sat upright in 
bed and peered out the window 
screen. Thunder rumbled again and 
she heard big splats of rain hit the 
foliage. She could see tree limbs 
thrash in the sudden wind. 

During a momentary flash of 
lightning she thought she saw some- 
thing else — a rectangular, black ob- 
ject hanging in the air over the new 
house. Then it was gone in the fad- 
ing light. Perhaps she should waken 
Sam, she thought. Instead she 
pressed her face against the screen, 
sucking in the fresh smell of wind 
and rain. 

III 

Since his marriage to Mary Sue, 
Sam always came home for lunch. 
Today he noticed that the lot around 
the new house was covered with 
grass. Yesterday it had been cov- 
ered with left-over construction 



materials, clay and an accumulation 
of odd debris. Now-.-grass. Sam 
snorted and slammed into the 
house. 

When Mary Sue called him to the 
table, she found him at the bedroom 
window, peering through the cur- 
tains. “Sam, what are you doing?” 
“I’m looking at that fellow over 
there, that’s what I’m doing. He 
looks like a damn Injun.” 

The man in question had ink-blue 
hair, red skin and high cheek bones; 
he was carefully planting small trees 
along the side of the new house. 
Sam also noted that he was young, 
strong-looking and what Mary Sue 
would probably consider handsome. 

“His name is Golby Bearhun- 
ken,” she said. 

Sam turned around. “What?” 
“Golby Bearhunken . and he 
says he’s here to stay.” 

“Golby Bearhunken says? Listen 
here, have you been talking to that 
hippie Injun?” Sam demanded to 
know. 

“Just to say hello for a minute. 1 
mean, he was in the front yard 
and — ” 

“Damn it, woman! I’m not going 
to have you talking to strangers. 
Has he got a wife?” 

“I don’t think so.” 

“Damn.” Sam ate his lunch 
morosely. The thought of a hand- 
some Indian bachelor living next 
door was difficult for him to han- 
dle. He glared at Mary Sue and 
asked, “Did you see them put the 
sod down?” 

She frowned. “1 don’t think any- 
one put sod down. I think ... I 
think it just grew there.” 

“You’re stupid,” Sam said, gulp- 
ing his coffee; then he banged out.

From work he called her and told 
her to stay in the house. That night 
there were flowers growing in front 
of the Bearhunken house. “Plas- 
tic,” Sam snorted. 

IV 

The complaint call went in and 
less than two minutes later Sheriff 
Lucas Stone and Deputy Otto Hall 
drove up. When Sam saw them, he 
dropped the shotgun. It clattered in 
the driveway. 

It was the fourth day since Golby 
Bearhunken had appeared. Sam had 
come home from lunch and noticed 
little trees, heavy with strange pur- 
ple fruit, growing in the front yard 
of the new house. It was also the 
day he could not find Mary Sue. He 
had searched the house and then 
walked into the back yard, where a 
certainty had gripped him. Angrily 
he strode to Bearhunken ’s place and 
rapped hard on the door. 

“You seen my wife?” he had 
shouted. 

Bearhunken’ s graphic white teeth 
sparkled in his grin, his dark eyes 
danced. “You have no wife.” 

“What — what’s that you say?” 

“You have no wife.” 

“Why, what the hell do you 
mean?” Sam yanked at the screen 
door. It was locked. “You’ve done 
something to her — I’ll kill you, 
you. .” He began kicking the 
door. 

Golby opened it and hit Sam 
neatly on the chin. From his seat on 
the pavement Sam looked up wildly 
and glimpsed Mary Sue’s tan face 
behind the still-grinning Golby. 

“She is now my wife,” Golby 
said.

“Mary Sue, what in hell are you 
doing over here?” 

“ Golby’ s teaching me some re- 
ally neat things,” she blurted, 
clearly distressed. “I’m going to 
live here from now on, Sam. Please 
go away.” 

“I’m going to kill the both of 
you!” Sam roared, his eyes smol- 
dering. 

Minutes later he was back, pep- 
ptering buckshot at the house and 
shouting for them to come out. He 
kicked at the doors and shot at the 
windows. His anger was com- 
pounded when the buckshot neither 
broke the windows nor dented the 
aluminum siding. He jumped up 
and down like an angered bear and 
tried to tear the drainpipe from the 
comer of the house with his bare 
hands. 

Afterward Sam was confined in a 
private sanitarium just outside De- 
troit. He did not like the place.

They plied him at regular hours 
with strange pills and asked him 
silly questions.. He told them of 
Golby Bearhunken and the strange 
fruit trees. And of Mary Sue. The 
doctors shook their heads and 
agreed that Sam was mildly psychot- 
ic. 

Later, when he gave up the story 
of the fruit trees, he was pro- 
nounced well on the road to recov- 
ery.

The owners of the house drove in 
from Detroit. Harold Krammer — a 
shaky little man in a gray suit — 
walked up to the porch. Beside him 
his plump wife gasped, tiny tears 
beading on her red cheeks. 

“Harold, someone has been liv- 
ing in our house. ...” 

Golby opened the door and 
smiled. 

“Sir, could you please explain 
the meaning of this?” Harold 
asked. Golby raised an eyebrow. 
“You, well . you seem to be liv- 
ing in our house,” Harold said. 

“Oh, no, that is impossible,” 
Golby replied. “This is my place.” 

“But, but. .” Harold looked at 
the street numbers on the house, 
took a breath and cleared his throat. 
“Now look here, we contracted to 
have this house built. We have pa- 
pers to prove this is our house.” 

“Impossible. I’m homesteading 
here and this is mine,” Golby said 
and shut the door. 

Harold swallowed stiffly. His 
wife daubed at her eyes with a per- 
fumed hankerchief. “Homestead- 
ing,” Harold breathed. He sounded 
puzzled. 



VI 

The next day the contractor came 
around. He was a big sunburned 
man and more aggressive than his 
client, Harold Krammer. 

“Okay, pal,” he said when 
Golby open^ the door, “you got 
about five minutes to get yourself 
out of this house.” He looked over 
Golby’s shoulder. “Hell,” he con- 
tinued, “you don’t even have any 
furniture, you squatter.” 

But Golby had shut the door. The 
contractor thought once about going 
in to get him, but instead he climbed 
into his pick-up and roared off. The 
sheriff would do the job. Squatters 
didn’t surprise him. He was kind of 
puzzled by the funny-looking fruit 
trees in the front yard, though. 

VII 

“I don’t know what your name 
is, fella,” Stone growled through 
the screen door, “but I have one 
eviction notice for a John Doe at 
this address and you look like 
him.” 

“I take it you are the law,” 
Golby said, glancing at Stone’s tan 
uniform and colorful shoulder 
patches. 

Deputy Hall snickered and rubbed 
a sleeve across his red-beak nose. 
“Take it any way you want, long as 
you take it out of this house,” he 
said. 

“And .who are you?” Golby 
turned his gaze on the deputy. 

“Hey,” Hall bridled, “what kind 
of crack is that? Isn’t he insulting 
an officer of the law or something 
like that?” he asked Stone.

“Come on out of there,” Stone 
ordered Colby shortly. 

“But this is my home now.” 

“Now look, buster.” The sheriff 
unsnapped the holster flap over his 
gun butt. “You better come out of 
there, right now.” 

Instead, Colby shut the door. 

“Damn,” Stone muttered. Hall 
finally got his holster flap open and 
cried nervously, “What now? What 
now?” 

“Come on,” Stone barked, 
stomping off the porch. They 
stopped in the yard to study the neat 
row of strange fruit trees with pur- 
ple globes hanging from the short 
branches. 

“Dangedest stuff I ever looked 
at,” Hall said. 

“Yeah,” Stone agreed. “Could 
be some kind of Oriental fruit.” 

“Pomegranates,” Hall said. 

Stone reached out to pick one. 

“Hey, you’re not going to eat 
that — ” 

“I swear, sometimes I don’t 
think you’re right smart in the 
head,” the sheriff said. “Of course 
I ain’t going to eat this. It could be 
evidence.” 

“Hmp,” Hall snorted. “I don’t 
know what of. ’ ’ 

No matter what, they couldn’t 
pull the fruit loose from the tree. 
Finally, the two men stalked 
empty-handed to the dusty black- 
and-white and climbed inside. 

“What now?” Hall asked. “We 
going to rush ’em?” 

Stone frowned impatiently. “That 
ain’t exactly Bonnie and Clyde in 
there. This ain’t like a hold-up. The 
nature of the crime of squatting in- 
dicates that we don’t have to worry 
too much about the suspects running 

THE POPULATION EXPLOSION 



off. You understand?” 

“Sure.” 

“Besides, I need a little time to 
think over what’s been going on 
here.” 

“Hell, yes,” Hall said. “I under- 
stand that.” 

VIII 

The main street of Lake Stover 
ran pleasantly two blocks along the 
north shore of the lake. The 
sheriff s office was right in the 
middle of town, on a comer across 
from Jacob’s Hardware. In the old 
days, when the water level had been 
higher, inmates had been known to 
fish out the back window of the 
jail. 

The hardware store was owned 
by Helen Jacob, whose family had 
founded the town. Helen was also 
the mayor and she owned a board- 
ing house on the lake at the east end 
of town. Her father had left her the 
hardware store and her mother had 
left her the boarding house. 

Helen had never been married 
and recently she had developed a 
nervous tic in her upper lip 
whenever she thought about Sheriff 
Stone, who was also unmarried. 
Helen was in his office now, deter- 
minedly keeping what she judged to 
be a cool distance between them as 
she explained her problem. 

“Okay,” Stone said, “let’s go 
over this one more time. You say 
you left three days ago on a 
hardware-buying trip to Chicago?” 

“That’s what she said all right,” 
Hall said, leaning against a 
mahogany gun-case by the door. 

“Now,” the sheriff continued, 

117 




“when you left, you say Mickey 
Bode was moving out of your 
boarding house?’ ’ 

“I never did like that Mickey 
Bode anyway,” said Hall, who also 
lived in Helen’s establishment. 

Helen nodded at the sheriff. 
“Leaving room three-A, to be 
exact.” 

“And you came back this morn- 
ing from Chicago?” 

She nodded again. 

“And you say you found some- 
body else living in room three-A, 
somebody who isn’t supposed to be 
there?” 

“An Indian boy. When I tell him 
the rent is twenty dollars a week, he 
just grins like an idiot.” 

Stone turned to Hall. “How long 
have you been deputy now?” 

“Me? What has it got to do with 
me?” Hall asked suspiciously. “I 
don’t even know the kid.” 

“Answer me, damn it.” 

Hall squinted into the middle dis- 
tance for a minute, then said, 
“Why, a little over three years 
now. We both got in at the same 
time.” 

Stone nodded. “And in that time 
how many have we arrested? 

The deputy snorted in the direc- 
tion of the two small cells with the 
dusty bars. “Hell, we ain’t never 
arrested nobody.” 

“That’s right,” the sheriff said. 
“And what kind of trouble have we 
had on the outside?” 

“Well, let’s see,” Hall said, en- 
joying the little game. “There’s old 
Mrs. Benson, who beats up her 
husband each month for getting 
drunk on his Social Security check. 
Last week she smacked him with a 
rake — ’ ’ 



“What else?” Stone cut in. 

“Well, we write traffic tickets, 
two or three a week.” 

“And?” 

Hall was silent for a minute. 
“That’s about all, ain’t it?” 

“Have we ever had any trouble 
with Indians?” 

“Are you kidding?” Hall snick- 
ered. “Heck, no.” 

Stone whacked his fist on the 
desk. He strode to the middle of the 
room, closer to Helen. “We’ve 
never had any Indian trouble in 
Lake Stover,” he said angrily. “I 
think this is some kind of plot.” 

Helen stepped back from Lucas 
Stone, her upper lip trembling as 
she said, “Maybe the boy isn’t In- 
dian. He could be a gypsy.” 

“Yeah,” Hall said, “it could be 
a gypsy plot.” 

Stone’s eye for detail caught the 
tiny nodes of perspiration across 
Helen’s forehead. “You okay?” he 
asked. “You look feverish.” 

“It’s nothing,” she panted. 

IX 

“John Wayne never had this 
trouble,” Hall said, limping on a 
bad ankle after having tried to kick 
down the door to room three-A. 

“Come on out of there!” Stone 
shouted. 

“No!” came a muffled reply. 
Helen stood back in the darkened 
hall, watching. Her lip twitched and 
her eyes flickered over Stone’s 
muscular body as he once again 
threw his shoulder against the door. 
He groaned. So far it was no use. 

“I’m getting this door open if it’s 
the last diing I do,” he grunted. 

“I have an idee,” Hall said. 
“Let’s shoot the lock off.”

“Good thinking. Run back to the 
office and get that ten-gauge mag- 
num.” 

“Hot damn!” Hall cried, hob- 
bling down the corridor, “we’ll blow 
that sucker right off.” 

“That’s a powerful gun, isn’t it, 
Lucas?” 

“Soaking wet, Otto weighs a 
hundred thirty-five pounds,” Stone 
replied. “That gun can rattle my 
teeth. Can you imagine what it can 
do to him?” 

“How much do you weigh?” 
Helen asked, her lip spasmodic. 

“About one-ninety,” Stone said, 
peering at her lip, stepping closer to 
her. “I hate to mention this again, 
but are you okay? 1 mean, you 
look—” 

A small yelp burst from her 
throat as she lurched at Stone, 
throwing her arms around his broad 
chest. “You’re driving me crazy,” 
she moaned, suddenly pulling at his 
shirt buttons. 

“Sweet Jesus!” Stone said. 

Then her wet lips were twitch- 
ing across his chest. She took his 
hand and frantically pulled him 
down the hall. “Here,” she said, 
“this room is empty.” She flung 
open the door. 

A brooding red man sat on the 
bed. Helen swooned. Stone caught 
her and carried her to a davenport 
near the stairwell. When he re- 
turned, the door was closed and 
locked. 

X 

Deputy Hall had just taken down 
the sleek magnum when an Olds 
stationwagon, belonging to the 
Friedrich family, skidded to a halt 
in the dust outside. In the back 

THE POPULATION EXPLOSION 



were suitcases, paper bags and a 
dog peering out a dirty side win- 
dow. Three children sat in the back 
seat. In the front were the Fried- 
richs, Nat and Clara. 

Instantly Nat leaped out and 
rushed into the sheriffs office. He 
slammed through the door, a grave 
look on his face. “I got trouble,” 
he shouted at Hall. 

Just then the phone rang. 

“Hmp,” Hall snorted, “we got 
trouble too. Big trouble.” 

“Oh, yeah? Well, my daughter’s 
been kidnapped and brainwashed. 
And there’s a madman forced his 
way into our house. We just came 
back from a two-week vacation — 
and there he is.” 

Hall answered the phone. 
“Christ!” said a gruff voice at the 
other end. “I’m going bald and I 
want to know what you’re going to 
do about it!” 

“Who are you and where do you 
live?” Hall asked. 

“We weren’t there but two min- 
utes when this madman chased us 
out of our own house. All except 
for my daughter. She wouldn’t 
leave. I think this guy is some kind 
of Indian. You’ve got to do some- 
thing.” 

Hall looked at the receiver and 
shook his head. 

“Verlaine,” the voice on the 
phone went on, spelling the name 
out carefully. “And I live up here 
on Elm Street, across the street 
from that squatter. When are you 
going to do something about that?” 

Hall had seen Jim Verlaine in 
town several times and knew the 
man was already as bald as a 
doorknob. “Mr. Verlaine,” the 
deputy said, “we have everything 

119 




under control and as for your bald- 
ness, I happen to know you’ve been 
bald for a long time.” 

“This isn’t Mr. Verlaine, this is 
Mrs. Verlaine, you idiot!” the 
voice barked and hung up. 

Nat Friedrich was pacing back 
and forth, shouting. “My daughter 
is only seventeen. If anything hap- 
pens to her. .” 

The door opened and what ap- 
peared to be a bald man entered the 
room, weeping. 

“My brother lives in Spring- 
dcile,” Nat went on. “I’m going 
over there and get his gun. Say, 
aren’t you my neighbor, Vicky 
Thatcher?” 

The bald person in slacks nodded 
yes and wailed. She was a twenty- 
three-year-old nurse and Otto Hall 
had gone to high school with her. 
“Lx)ok at me,” she cried, “just 
look at me.” Hall did. He couldn’t 
believe his eyes — her white, naked 
head so totally amazed him. 

“What happened?” he blurted. 

“I had Elmo Bearhunken in for 
tea and after he left, my hair began 
falling out,” she screamed. “I think 
I’m going crazy!” 

The phone rang again. “What’s 
taking you so long?” Stone asked. 

“Lucas,” Hall said, “I think you 
better get down here pronto.” 

XI 

The two men started out to spend 
the night in the sheriffs office, get- 
ting drunk on Old Underroof and 
discussing events. 

“Maybe we ought to call in rein- 
forcements,” Hall offered. 

“Like?” asked Stone, who was 
seated at his desk. Hall was perched 



in a wooden chair opposite. 

“Like the city police over at 
Springdale, or maybe even the state 
boys.” 

Stone shook his head and tilted 
back in -his chair. “You want the 
whole goddam country to know I 
can’t dislodge a couple of goddam 
squatters?” 

“Why, hell, no.” 

“Okay then.” 

“Okay,” Hall echoed, filling 
their shot glasses again. “What are 
we going to do then?” 

“The way I figure it, we have to 
run squatters off three places. First 
thing in the morning I’m going to 
blow some doors off their hinges 
and throw them goddam trou- 
blemakers in Jail. Then I’m going to 
have breakfast.” 

Hall snickered. “Yeah, I forgot 
about this baby.” He hefted the 
ten-gauge magnum off the desk. 
“Blam, blam,” he said, pointing it 
at the door. 

Stone measured out more drinks. 
“Ever shoot one of them?” 

“What? Me?” Hall’s face red- 
dened. “Goddam right I have. 
Once.” 

By now it was nearly mid- 
night — and the phone rang. 

“I cannot understand your ag- 
gressive actions,” Golby Bearhun- 
ken said on the other end. 

“Who is this?” Stone asked, tak- 
ing a slug of whiskey. The answer 
almost strangled him. “You . 
you . .” he spluttered. “How did 
you get on the phone?” 

“Why, I had one installed today. 
Now, as I said, I don’t understand 
your aggressive actions.” 

“My aggressive actions!” Stone 
exploded.

“Sure, aren’t you the one who 
tried to batter open the doors of my 
brothers at the Jacob boarding 
house? We have done nothing. We 
come in peace.” 

“Peace!” roared Stone. “You’re 
squatting in somebody else’s 
house — and you’re a damn wife- 
stealer to boot.” 

“The woman’s choice was to live 
with me. Then it was her choice to 
leave and she left.” 

“Mary Sue left?” 

“Yes, her hair fell out and she 
became hysterical. I think she is 
hiding out in the woods down by 
the lake. As for the house and land, 
it was not occupied. Under inter- 
galactic law, it is legal to home- 
stead places that have been empty 
for more than thirty- six hours.” 

“The hell you say! I don’t know 
where you came from, but you bet- 
ter go back. We don’t want you,” 
Stone yelled. 

“I will never go back. It is too 
crowded,” Golby stated. 

“Then tomorrow I’m coming for 
you,” Stone warned and hung up. 
He turned to Hall and said, “Not 
only is he a squatter but he’s nuts, 
talking about inter-galactic law and 
such.” Then he told Hall about 
Mary Sue’s having gone bald and 
hiding out in the woods. 

They drank in silence for a while 
before Hall said, “This sure seems 
like serious business. 1 mean, with 
the baldness and all. It kind of puts 
a weird light on things. How do 
you figure it?” 

Stone shrugged. “It looks to me 
like some kind of plot to get public- 
ity, but I’m sitting on this. Nobody 
or any group is going to put some- 
thing over on Lucas Stone. I’m not 

THE POPULATION EXPLOSION 



exactly a fool, you know,” he said, 
now drinking straight from the bot- 
tle. 

“Aw, hell, no,” Hall responded, 
“you ain’t no fool. You figure 
Mary Sue’s and Vickey Thatcher’s 
hair will grow back?” 

“Maybe.” 

“You think Vickey is going to 
move out of town?” 

“Said she was, didn’t she?” 

“Yep.” 

The bottle went back and forth. 

“I had an aunt got ball-headed 
once,” Hall said. 

“Yeah?” 

“Yeah, from radiation treat- 
ments. She had cancer.” 

Stone squinted. “Maybe we 
ought to write that down.” 

“May-be,” Hall agreed. 

Soon the bottle was empty and 
the deputy fell asleep in the chair. 
Stone got up, left and walked down 
to the Jacob boarding house. There 
he stumbled into Helen’s room. She 
moaned against him in the dark 
bed, dreaming. 

XII 

“Jesus!” Hall said when Stone 
finally opened the door a slight 
crack. “It’s nearly noon. I been 
looking for you all over town. Ev- 
erywhere I go, it’s bad news.” 

Stone sighed and buckled the 
pants he had pulled on before an- 
swering the door. Then he swore 
and said, “Now what?” Behind 
him on the bed, Helen stretched, 
yawning. 

“I’ll tell you what,” Hall said. 
“I think there’s some kind of inva- 
sion going on. The old feed store 

121 




on Main has squahers in it and so 
does that other empty storefront fur- 
ther up.” 

Stone shook his head and it felt 
like a hand grenade going off. He 
was not used to drinking. 

Hall listed fourteen other places 
that were now recently inhabited — 
including Hall’s own room in the 
boarding house, Sam Russo’s old 
house and Vickey Thatcher’s place. 
He saved the worst for last. ‘T 
don’t know how to tell you this, 
Lucas, but when I was looking for 
you this morning, the first place 1 
went to was your house.” Stone 
had a small frame house at the other 
end of Lake Stover. 

“You mean. .” 

Hall nodded. “Two of them, big 
as you please, sitting right there on 
the porch. 1 tried to arrest them but 
they got in the house and locked it 
up as tight as a drum.” 

“This is the last straw,” Stone 
said. 

XllI 

Lucas Stone figured that Golby 
Bearhunken, up in the new house 
on Elm Street, was the ringleader of 
the conspiracy. And therefore he 
must be the first to go. From a con- 
struction site just outside of town 
Stone had commandeered a yellow 
bulldozer the size of a small house. 
New apartments were going up and 
although the buildings were only 
half-finished. Stone was shocked to 
see squatters in them. Well, he 
would worry about that when he got 
rid of Golby Bearhunken. 

Word had preceded the roaring 
John Deere with Stone at the con- 
trols and Hall literally riding shot- 



gun. A swarm of spectators, some 
bald and looking for blood, milled 
around in front of the target on Elm 
Street. When the yellow monster 
came growling over th^ hill, the 
crowd cheered. The machine was 
rolling along at full speed and Hall 
stood up and raised the gun above 
his head. The crowd cheered again. 

“Nam was never like this,” Hall 
shouted but Stone could not hear 
him. 

The crowd broke apart as the 
dozer came on; then the Deere 
turned and crunched over the curb, 
tearing at the grass, on a collision 
course with the Bearhunken house. 
Hall stood up, leveled the magnum 
at the front door and loosed a volley 
as the crowd cheered again. Stone 
had cried out but it was too late. 
The kick of the powerful gun 
slapped Hall over the back of the 
dozer and dumped him to the 
ground in a heap. Stone brought the 
big machine to a halt, afraid Hall 
might be dead of a broken neck. 
But the deputy got up and the 
crowd cheered again. 

“Goddam you, Otto,” Stone said 
as Hall climbed back aboard. 

“Hit ’em!” Hall cried and there 
were tears in his eyes. “Hit ’em 
and tear that goddam house in 
half.” 

Stone jammed on the throttle. A 
row of strange fruit trees went first, 
grinding under the left tread, as the 
dozer lumbered toward the front 
door. The big tractor hit the house 
blade-first, head-on, shuddered and 
stalled. The impact threw both men 
crashing to the ground. They 
climbed back on and looked at each 
other. 

In the sudden silence Stone said, 



t22

“Don’t tell me they don’t make ’em 
like they used to. There must be an 
art to this.’’ 

“Take a rip at the corner,’’ Hall 
shouted as Stone brought the 
bulldozer, trembling, back to life. 
Then the gleaming steel blade bit at 
the corner of the house and bounced 
off without so much as scratching 
it. Stone tried again — with the same 
result. He raised the blade up to the 
eaves and tried to pry them loose. 
They remained firm. When he 
backed up to the street again, the 
front door of the house opened and 
Golby Bearhunken strode out, arms 
in the air. 

“He’s giving up!’’ somebody 
shouted. The crowd cheered and 
then hushed. Stone shut off the 
dozer. 

“It is strange,’’ Golby said, 
“that you would destroy the very 



house you wish me out of, just to 
get me out. You are savages and an 
ignorant people. You are making it 
difficult for me to homestead here 
by destroying my crops. But you 
cannot win. This part of the galaxy 
has been opened to homesteading, 
and others like me are coming — 
more than you can imagine — and 
there is nothing you can do about it. 
You cannot stop progress.’’ After 
this announcement he stepped back 
into the house. 

“Get him, get him!’’ Hall 
screamed. 

Stone cranked up the yellow 
monster once more and began his 
run at the house only to find that 
now he could not even get into the 
yard, much less the house. But he 
kept on trying for a long, long 
time — even though he knew it was 
useless. ★

back? . That’s not a dumb ques- 
tion, it’s cold in here! Nothin’ but a 
lousy bathrobe, an’ it’s two sizes 
too big! . Don’t gimme that 
“There is no need to talk so loud’’ 
crap. I’ll talk as loud as I want if 
it’ll get me my clothes back. 
Awright, awright I’ll tell ya what 
happened. I don’t see what for, 
though. I awready told it twice to 
the cops that brought me in an’ 
twice to the desk sergeant an’ twice 
to the shrink. Why don’t you Air 
Force guys go get it from them? 

. Awright, awright, step by 
step. 

I was out walkin’ the dog. 
Ten o’clock. The only good thing 
on was Charlie's Angels an’ I seen 
that one awready, so I decided to 
take my time this time, even though 
I hate walkin’ the dog. My dad says 
that I always walk the dog too fast 
anyway. 

Well, anyhow, I decide to take 
Domino . Yeah, that’s the dog’s 
name. I decide to take Domino over 
to the woods a couple o’ blocks 
from my house. 1 never been over 
there before, but my dad keeps tell- 
ing me that when he walks her it’s 
a nice place to go. 

Anyhow, when we get over to 
the woods I start bearin’ this real 
low hum. It’s so low that I can 
hardly hear it, but it’s there. There 
ain’t too many lights in that part o’ 



New Rochelle, and there wasn’t 
even a moon out last night, so I 
could hardly see the trees. But I 
wanted to see where that sound was 
cornin’ from, so I made Domino 
walk ahead o’ me down the path I 
found that zig-zagged through the 
trees. 

I tripped on tree roots four or five 
times, but I wasn’t gonna let the 
darkness stop me. My curiosity was 
really up. After a while the sound 
starts gettin’ louder an’ Domino 
starts pullin’ on the leash. I let her 
keep goin’ toward the sound, but 
not too fast ’cause I don’t have the 
slightest idea what it is. 

Anyhow, soon we come to this 
clearing, a big one. An’ — now get 
this — sittin’ right in the middle o’ 
this clearing is this space ship! . 
No, not a flyin’ saucer, a space 
ship! It looked like somethin’ I saw 
in a science fiction movie once. It 
was round like a ball an’ about 
twenty feet high an’ sittin’ on four 
metal legs that had these flat things 
on the bottoms — . “Landing 
pods?” Well, if you say so. Any- 
how, there was a kind of a glow 
around this thing, the only reason 
why I could see it. 

Domino starts growlin’ way down 
in ’er throat, meanin’ that there’s 
somethin’ close by — that’s alive — 
that she doesn’t like. But I wasn’t 
gonna let that stop me from gettin’ 



TWO OF A KIND

a close look at this space ship. I 
choked up on her leash a bit, then 
started walkin’ real slow t’ward it. 
All the time this hummin’ sound is 
gettin’ louder an’ louder, so I knew 
it was comin from the ship. When 
we get about ten feet away from it, 
the humming sound stops! 

I figure thht whatever it is that’s 
inside knows that Domino an’ me 
are there, so I back off a couple o’ 
steps an’ pull her back. Then we 
just stand there a couple o’ minutes, 
waitin’ for somethin’ to happen. 
Nothin’ does. Then we start walkin’ 
around the thing. I couldn’t see any 
kind o’ door or window on it at 
all. No, there was no kind o’ 
antennae or anything else. ’Cept for 
where the legs came out o’ the bot- 
tom, it looked to be perfectly 
smooth all around. 

We walked around that thing 
twice. Domino sniffed at the ground 
every once in a while, and on the 
second time around she found some- 
thin’ that really caught her atten- 
tion. She ain’t a bloodhound, but 
she sure started actin’ like one. She 
started tuggin’ at the leash, movin’ 
toward the trees on the far side of 
the clearing from were we entered 
it. I loosened up on the leash a little 
and let her lead me where she 
wanted to go. At the moment, 
though, it really wasn’t a very 
bright idea, ’cause I didn’t think she 
could see where she was goin’, an’ 

1 knew 1 couldn’t. 

But that problem didn’t last very 
long. After we stumbled along in 
the dark for about fifty feet, 1 began 
to notice that the whole place was 
gettin’ lighter, little by little. I 
looked back over my shoulder an’ 
saw that the space ship was startin’ 



to glow brighter ’n’ brighter, but it 
didn’t start makin’ any noise again. 
I didn’t know if it was goin’ to 
explode or what. 

All of a sudden Domino stopped 
short an’ I almost tripped over ’er. 
Then I saw why she was actin’ so 
funny. Right in front of us there 
was this — -patch o’ yellow fog. A 
little one. ’Bout three feet high an’ 
wide. No, it didn’t move, it 
just sat there on the ground in front 
of us. It was so wierd that I forgot 
about the space ship for a moment. 
Domino didn’t want to get near the 
stuff — an’ neither did I — but we just 
stood there watchin’ it. 

It was breakin’ up — dissolvin’ — 
right before our eyes. In about a 
minute it was gone, like it was 
never there. No odor, no nothin’. 

An’ then we both heard this 
funny gruntin’ sound. Domino 
pricked ’er ears up an’ must have 
been listenin’ as hard as I was. It 
sounded like a bunch o’ wild hogs, 
an’ 1 know there ain’t none o’ them 
in New Rochelle. Skunks, yes. 
Raccoons, yes. But no wild hogs. 
All of a sudden Domino bolted, pul- 
lin’ the leash right out o’ my hand. 
She ran around the spot where the 
fog had been an’ headed straight for 
the sound. 

I yelled at ’er to stop an’ come 
back, but she ignored me (as usual). 
I tore off after ’er (after bein’ care- 
ful to step around the same spot she 
did), still callin’ for her to come 
back. 1 don’t know why, but while 
I was chasin’ after that dumb dog, I 
noticed that it’d stopped growin’ 
lighter. It was just light enough for 
me to be able to see the trees at the 
far side o’ the clearing — an’ I could 
just make out Domino runnin’ 



126 



GALAXY 




ahead o’ me — an’ somethin’ else. 
Somethin’ big an’ dark. That 
moved. 

Domino finally stopped runnin’ 
when she was about thirty feet away 
from that thing. Then she just stood 
there barkin’ at it. I caught up to 
her, grabbed her leash an’ wrapped 
it around my hand, to make sure 
she wouldn’t get away again. Then 
1 took a good look at what she was 
barkin’ at. An’ I could hardly be- 
lieve what 1 was seein’. 

It looked like a fat toad, all 
bloated an’ ugly an’ with eyes as 
big as two basketballs. With eyes as 
big as those 1 figgered that it could 
see in the dark better’ n a cat. Those 
two giant eyes stared at me an’ 
Domino like they were lookin’ right 
through us. 

Man, you talk about bein’ 
scared] I didn’t know whether to 
run or stand still. An’ if it decided 
to come after us, forget it] You ever 
tried outrunnin’ somethin’ that was 
as big as a grizzly bear an’ had 
eight legs? . Yeah, that’s right, 
eight legs. Thick an’ stubby like 
legs on a hippo. 

Anyhow, Domino started barkin’ 
at it again. I pulled on ’er leash, 
tryin’ to get ’er to shut up. But she 
wouldn’t. I looked at that thing 
from outer space, waitin’ for it to 
make the first move. But just made 
that weird wild hog sound — without 
even openin’ its mouth — an’ turned 
its back to me an’ Domino. 

I was so relieved I even started 
breathin’ again. Not wishin’ to push 
my luck, 1 start backin’ up real 
slow, jerkin’ on Domino’s leash a 
couple o’ times to make ’er behave. 
All of a sudden 1 had this weird 
feelin’ that I was bein’ watched. I 



twisted my head around an’ looked 
back in the direction o’ the space 
ship — an’ froze. 

There was a large, rectangular 
door in the side o’ the space ship 
where there was no door before. 
An’ standin’ in the doorway was 
this shadow — ’bout seven feet tall, 
shaped like a man. He just stood 
there, starin’ at me. An’ I just stood 
there starin’ at him. Then I hear this 
hissin’ sound, cornin’ from where 
the eight-legged thing is. 

I turn my head back around in 
time to see a. yellow fog — twin 
brother o’ the other one — cornin’ 
right at my face. I drop down to the 
ground, pullin’ Domino down with 
me, an’ the fog passes over without 
touchin’ me. That’s why you guys 
are wastin’ your time tryin’ to 
analyze my clothes. You ain’t 
gonna find nothin’ .

Anyhow, I watched that patch o’ 
fog drift away, dissolvin’ as it 
went. Then I looked back at the 
shadow in the doorway as it lifted 
one of its hands to the front of its 
head an’ somehow made a wierd, 
high-pitched sound. Whatever that 
sound was, it made me shiver from 
head to toe .an’ it made Domino 
start whinin’ an’ whimperin’. 

It stopped after a few seconds, 
an’ when it did, that eight-legged 
thing galloped around past me an’ 
Domino an’ made a bee-line for the 
space ship. An’ with eight legs to 
run with it was movin’ pretty fast. 
It took the four-foot high leap from 
the ground to the doorway with no 
trouble at all. 

An’ when that shadow stepped 
back from the door to let it get in- 
side, 1 saw what he really looked 
like: human-like, but with skin that 
looked like black leather. No hair 
on his face or head. ... A tight, 
yellow thing that looked like a polo 
shirt, an’ a pair o’ tight yellow 
shorts. Nothin’ else. 

Domino started barkin’ at the 
eight-legged thing again as it 
jumped into the space ship. But I 
kept a tight grip on ’er leash as I let 
her up, then got up myself. All the 
time I never took my eye off that 
doorway. An’ all the time that alien 
never took his eyes off me. As 1 
stood there watchin’ him, I began to 
realize that the pool o’ light that 
he’d stepped back into was gettin’ 
brighter. An’ the clearing was get- 
tin’ darker. 

So help me, I never saw him 
move a muscle, but somehow he 
made the outside o’ the ship slowly 
stop glowin’. An’ before I knew it, 
the woods were back to nighttime. 



Then the door slowly slid shut, an’ 
the space ship started the hummin’ 
sound again. I took off for the 
trees, with Domino right beside me. 
I was expectin’ that space ship to 
take off like a rocket, all fire an’ 
brimstone, an’ I didn’t want to wind 
up like a piece o’ overdone friend 
chicken. 

With the darkness back, I 
couldn’t see where I was goin’, so 
that log I fell over took me com- 
pletely by surprise. 1 sat up and 
turned around (which was a little 
difficult with Domino climbin’ all 
over me) just in time to watch that 
space ship rise up off the ground 
about ten feet like it was a helium 
balloon. It hung there in the air 
about ten feet off the ground, just 
long enough to pull its four legs up 
inside. Then that metal ball rose 
straight up, movin’ faster every 
second. It was outta sight in less 
than a minute. 

I sat there for a minute or two, 
tryin’ to figure out what had hap- 
piened; the hummin’ space ship, the 
man-alien, the frog-alien, the yel- 
low fog — some of it made sense, 
and some of it didn’t, especially the 
yellow fog. 

Well, anyhow, Domino starts 
barkin’ again, so I get on my feet 
an’ get ready for whatever else 
could be cornin’, though 1 didn’t 
think anything could top whaf d aw- 
ready happened. Turned out I was 
right; it was just the two cops with 
flashlights. They said somebody in 
the neighborhood phoned in a com- 
plaint about wierd sounds an’ bright 
lights. I gave ’em a short run-down 
on what happened, even though I 
knew they wouldn’t believe me. 

And they didn’t. They looked at 



128 



GALAXY 




me like I was high on somethin’, 
even after I showed them where the 
landing pods left prints in the 

ground. Thay hauled me an’ the 

dog down to the precinct an’ 1 told 
my story to the desk sergeant an’ 
then he sent me to the shrink to find 
out what 1 was high on an’ the 
shrink listened to me an’ then called 
me a pill-popper an’ then I 

screamed a lot ’til they let me have 
my one phone call. 

I called my old man an’ he 

screamed at me a lot over the phone 
an’ got down there faster’ n you can 
blink. It took me a while to con- 
vince ’him I was playin’ it straight, 
but when I did, he called you 
guys . You checked out the 
clearing? . An’ tracks from the 
eight-legged thing, too? . Well, I 
hope you’ll pardon me if I don’t do 
handsprings, It’s only taken half a 
day to get somebody in a position 
of authority to believe me. When 
can I have my clothes back? 

. No, I don’t think they were 
invaders or ambassadors or explor- 
ers or anything like that . “Vis- 
itors?” Well, only in the way you 
“visit” a gas station during a long 
trip from one place to another . 
Okay, I’ll tell you what I mean. But 
you’re gonna be disappointed . 
Ya see, I figured out on the way 
over here what it was all about — the 
landing, the yellow fog, the whole 
bit. It was so simple I could kick 
myself for not seein’ it in the first 
place. 

•And ya know what the key was? 
The look on the man-alien’s face 
just before he shut the space ship 
door. He realized that he an’ I were 
two of a kind. We were both out 
there for the same reason! ★

It was really the oddest toy. And the boy 
who got it never knew how odd; not 
while he was a boy 



A. GIFT. A GIFT. 

As usual, Martin Selby had waited 
until the last minute to do his gift 
shopping. He hated having put it 
off; he hated doing it at all. Such a 
nuisance. It seemed there was no 
time at all between birthdays, holi- 
days, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, 
anniversaries, an illness. 

Not that he had anything against 
gifts. It was just that it was so hard 
to find something unusual, some- 
thing different, something that stood 
out and caught the eye. He was at 
that time of life when the only gifts 
he received were socks, ties, shirts 
and shaving lotion — until his dresser 
drawers bulged with unusued collec- 
tions of these things. 

So he tramped the streets for 
hours, determined to find that spe- 
cial something. And he had to ad- 
mit, ruefully, that the odds were he 
would go home empty-handed. But 
that was in his nature. For him it 
was all or none, double or nothing. 

A gift. A gift. 

He turned a comer. Curios, read 
the sign on the window. The Un- 
usual Store For The Unusual Shop- 
per, With That Special Gift You’ve 
Been Looking For. 

“Who’re you kidding?” he mut- 
tered. “You’re probably just like all 
the rest.” But for some indefinable 
reason he hesitated, turned and 



stared at the sign. “What the 
hell—” 

From the very first he noticed the 
store’s cheerful atmosphere. From 
the outside it had appieared drab, in- 
conspicuous, as though the owner 
might have something to hide. But 
here, inside. 

“Well now,” he whispered to 
himself. He had to admit that it was 
colorful, very colorful. Whoever 
had arranged it had taste. Glittering 
mobiles hung from the ceiling, 
shelves and counters were covered 
with toys and exhibits. Sweet fra- 
grances filled the air and soft notes 
chimed in a variety of melodies, 
the total effect was dazzling. “Like 
Ali Baba’s cave,” he thought. 

He looked around further. 

Fuzzballs, read the sign. Great 
for kids! Fuzzballs? He looked into 
the plastic cage and saw a number 
of tiny, furry balls crawling on the 
floor. Two brown eyes like little 
brown bubbles stared up from each 
of the unusual creatures. They 
looked very soft, very appealing. 
Fuzzballs? 

He moved on. There was a set of 
long, erect crystals that looked like 
towers. He inspected them more 
closely. They resembled castles, 
rough and cmde castles, in a variety 
of colors. 

And then. The World’s Only Mu- 
sical Seashell! read the next

placard. He picked up the shell and 
put it to his ear. There was the 
sound of a distant sea murmuring 
and the happy songs of a Polynesian 
festivity. For a brief moment he 
imaging himself adrift in the ocean, 
eavesdropping on a South Pacific is- 
land. He took the shell from his 
ear, stared at it, shook it and put it 
back to his ear. Again he heard the 
ocean’s murmur — and something 
else too: a feminine voice, so 
sweet, so haunting, that he was 
scarcely able to put the shell down. 

Three chimes struck just then. 
Stone Age Clock. He watched as the 
crude structure came alive. Beneath 
the clock dials a caveman and a 
cavewoman emerged from separate 
caves. In a stilted minuet they met 
and the caveman clubbed the 
woman three times over her head 
and dragged her into his cave. 

Martin laughed, feeling a rising 
good humor. He moved on. A 
green candle in the shape of the 
Statue of Liberty, with torch alight, 
giving off a refreshing lime 
odor. a miniature chandelier 
studded with imitation diamonds 
that sparkled each time he moved 
. See the World Through 
Rose-Colored Glasses. 

He picked up the oversized pink 
glasses — and almost gasped aloud in 
wonder. The chandelier had become 
a fiery torch of rubies, the crystal 
castles glowed in strange, amazing 
colors. The paintings on the walls 
seemed to have come to life. 

Inexpressibly Martin felt long- 
forgotten emotions stirring. 
Memories he thought had died and 
been lost forever were bursting 
forth. He remembered once more 
what it was like to be a child; he 



remembered what it was like before 
he had forced upon him the most 
important thing of all — Getting 
Ahead. He remembered a world now 
visible only through rose-colored 
glasses. And what was wrong with 
that? Wasn’t there something to be 
said after all, for seeing the better 
half of life? 

“Have you been helped, sir?’’ 

He fumbled with the glasses, hur- 
riedly removing them, realizing how 
silly he must have looked, staring, 
gawking, a silly smile on his face. 

“Oh, yes, I. .I’m looking for 
some presents for my little boy. It’s 
his birthday.’’ He looked down at 
the short, pixy-like clerk. 

“Have you found anything you’d 
like, sir?’’ 

“Yes, these glasses and. ’’ he 
stared behind her, “that doll — why, 
it looks Just like my little boy.’’ He 
went over to the doll. Wind Down 
Toy, read the sign at its feet. 

He took the doll in his hands. It 
was no more than ten inches tall. 
“How do you wind it up? There’s 
no key on its back.’’ 

“You can’t wind it up, sir. It 
only winds down.” 

Martin looked at her with a puz- 
zled expression. 

“But it lasts a long time,” she 
assured him, smiling. 

He placed it on the floor. Im- 
mediately it stepped off with such a 
lifelike gait that he broke out laugh- 
ing. “I’ll take it!” 

Walking on a cloud of enchant- 
ment, he set off for home. 

“Here you are, Joey. Look at 
what Daddy brought you for your 
birthday.” He put the oversized 
glasses on the small, happy face, 
chuckling as he did so. “You look 



132 



GALAXY 




like a big bug, Joey.” 

The little boy gave a squeal of 
delight and began running around in 
circles, peering at everything, stop- 
ping, staring; then he dashed out the 
door, crying in joy as he chased a 
butterfly through the garden. 

“Oh, my, it looks like you’ve 
found something he really likes. 
And what’s that?” 

Martin glanced at his wife; she 
seemed to be infected too with high 
spirits. He opened the box and took 
out the doll. 

“O o o , wherever did you get 
that? Why, it looks just like Joey! It 
even has the same clothes on.” 

Martin looked at the doll. Yes, 
that was certainly a coincidence. It 
was dressed in the very same 
clothes. He took the little figure and 
set it on the floor. Immediately it 
walked off in a gait similar to his 
son’s and then stopped. 

“Why, I’ve never seen anything 
like it!” Martin’s wife took it in her 
hands and held it gently, as though 
she feared she might harm a living 
being. She touched it and caressed 
it, feeling nothing more than the 
soft plastic skin under her fingers. 
“It’s so real — ” 

“You should see some of the 
other toys they have, Jean.” 

“Who has? What was the name 
of the store?” 

Martin thought. “Hm-m-m. I 
can’t remember. But 1 do remember 
where it was. We’ll have to go 
there together next weekend — and 
remind me to get Joey some 
fuzzballs. 

Jean stared at him with a puzzled 
expression in her eyes. 

“Oh, some pets. They’re very 
cute, furry little pets. Joey needs 



some pets,” he said, somewhat em- 
barrassed. 

A week later, as he was walking 
down the street with his wife he 
told her, ”... and I just turned this 
comer,” he gestured with out- 
stretched hand, “and there it was.” 
Smiling with anticipation, he looked 
at his wife, who only stared at him 
with a puzzled little frown. He 
turned to the store. 

The signs had been removed. All 
the posters and advertisements were 
gone. Inside, the store was bare and 
dusty. He tugged at the locked 
door. 

“Why, this can’t be. It was here 
just a week ago.” He looked to the 
left and the right. “Just a minute, 
let me check next door.” 

He returned with a look of disap- 
pointment. “The owner left town 
and didn’t leave any forwarding 
address.” Once again he stopped 
before the empty store and his eyes 
searched the barren space intently, 
as though trying to will it back into 
existence. Open Sesame! 

His wife took his arm in hers. 
“That’s too bad, dear. I feel like 
I’ve missed out on something.” 

Martin clasped her arm but re- 
mained silent. How could he tell 
her? How could he tell her what it 
meant to be bom again, to be a 
child again? He looked through the 
plateglass windown and saw, in his 
mind’s eye, all the beautiful things, 
all the wondrous treasures of the 
imagination, Ali Baba’s cave. He 
rememberd a time when life was 
sheer adventure, awaiting him, and 
all the world aquiver with newborn 
magic.

THE WIND-DOWN TOY 



133 




“Oh, here are more toys for the 
children to play with.” He opened 
the chest and reached in. “No sense 
in throwing them away if they’re 
still good.” He picked up one of 
the old, dusty toys and looked at it 
closely. “Why, I remember this! 
My father gave it to me when I was 
a little boy.‘ Haven’t seen it in 
years; I thought I had lost it.” 

A little girl came running to his 
side. “Daddy, Daddy, it looks just 
like you!” 

He looked at the doll again. Yes, 
it did look remarkably like him. He 
put it down on the floor and im- 
mediately it set off walking. 

The little girl laughed in delight. 
“It walks just like you, Daddy. It 
walks just like you.” 

He felt embarrassed; indeed the 
little doll did walk just as he did. It 
looked like a little comedian, mock- 
ing him. 

“What’s all the commotion? Oh, 
my — ” The woman fell into peals 
of laughter, her husband and daugh- 
ter joining her. “Where did you get 
it?” she asked. 

“My father gave it to me when I 
was a little boy, Linda.” He picked 
up the doll. “Funny, but I re- 
member it as looking younger and 
walking faster. 1 wonder if it’s the 
same doll. 

“Rummaging through the trunk, 
he spotted a flash of pink. “Oh, 
and here’s something else for Patty 
to play with.” 

He took the rose-colored glasses 
in his hands and put them on. “No 
mistaking these.” The old magic re- 
turned immediately, sending the 
world a cheerful kaleidoscope 
shimmering with each turn of his 
hand. “Here, Patty, you try them 
on.” 

134 



Joe placed the glasses on her 
face. Linda chuckled; their little girl 
was like a pink bug-eyed bug. 

“Gee!” Patty looked around the 
room, ran to the door, stopped, 
stared — and dashed out of the house 
with squeals of delight.

“Tell me a story, Granpa. Tell 
me a story.” 

The old man held the little girl in 
his arms. “A fairy tale?” 

“Yes, Granpa, a fairy tale.” 

“Oh, let’s see. Once upon a 
time. once upon a time they 
lived happily ever after.” 

The little girl stared blankly, then 
slapped at his hand. “Aw, that’s no 
fairy tale, Granpa Joey.” 

“I’ve got a better idea, Amy. 
Let’s sing a song.” He stood up 
and walked slowly and stiffly to the 
piano. “Come over here and sit on 
Granpa’s lap.” 

The little girl settled herself and 
joined the old man as he struck the 
keys and sang: 

My grandfather’s clock was too 
large for the shelf 
So it stood ninety years on the 
floor. 

It was taller by half than the old 
man himself 

Though it weighed not a pen- 
nyweight more. 

It was bought on the morn of the 
day that he was bom 
And was always his treasure 
and pride. 

But it stopped short, never to go 
again, 

When the old man died. 



GALAXY 




When they stopped singing, the 
old man said, “And now, Amy, 
since it’s your birthday and since 
you’ve been such a good girl, 
Granpa has a surprise for you.” He 
opened an old, battered box and 
took out a little doll. “When 
Granpa was a very little boy, this 
was a present his father gave him.” 

The little girl’s eyes widened. 
When Granpa was a little boy! 

He set the doll on its feet and 
immediately it walked off in a slow 
shuffle, its back bent. 

“Gosh, Granpa, it looks just like 
you! And it walks just like you!” 
Amy took the small figure in her 
hands and her fingers searched 
along its back. “Where do you 
wind it up?” 

The old man studied the doll in- 
tently; it seemed as though he fi- 
nally had a long-sought for answer. 
“You can’t wind it up, Amy; it’s a 
wind-down toy. It winds only one 
way and when it winds all the way 
down and stops, you can never 
wind it up again.” 

Then he reached down into the 
box and pulled out the rose-colored 
glasses. “And here’s another pres- 
ent for you.” He put the glasses 
on and again the old magic re- 
turned, as vivid as ever. He looked 
through the glasses for a long, long 
time before removing them, his 
hands trembling, his eyes moist. 
Behind over, he carefully put them 
on the little girl’s nose. 

“Oh!” 

Then he took Amy’s face be- 
tween his hands and kissed her 
forehead. “Do you know why your 
Granpa likes to play with you? Be- 
cause when he’s with you, it’s like 
looking at the world through rose- 



colored glasses — everything’s pretty 
again.” 

“But isn’t everything always pret- 
ty, Granpa?” 

“No. When you grow up, you’ll 
look at some things again and they 
won’t seem pretty any more. But 
when I’m with you, everything is 
pretty. Now. take these toys and 
go play. Your Granpa’ s going to 
take a rest.” 

The little girl ran from the room, 
put the doll aside and began to dash 
about in circles, peering at every- 
thing, stopping, staring — and then 
she dashed out the door, crying in 
delight as she chased a butterfly 
through the garden. 

When she returned, she took the 
doll in her hands and set it on its 
feet. The toy fell backward and lay 
very still. “Come on, dolly, walk.” 
Again and again she placed it on its 
feet — and each time the doll fell 
backward and lay motionless. 

She ran to her grandfather’s 
room. “Granpa, Granpa.” 

He lay motionless on the bed and 
gave no answer. 

“Granpa.” She ran to the bed 
and tugged on her grandfather’s 
arm. “Granpa, Granpa Joey.” 

But he said nothing, and his arm 
felt cold and stiff. 

The little girl pulled her hand 
away, her eyes large and bewildered 
as she stared at the figure lying mo- 
tionless on the bed. 

Slowly she backed out of the 
room. Suddenly the house seemed 
very silent. 

Then she ran off, calling in a soft 
voice, “Granma, Granma, the 
wind-down toy stopped. The wind- 
down toy stopped, Granma. Gran- 
ma. ...” ★

Dickson's Dozen 

Of the Nebula Award volumes I 
have read, I found Nebula Winners 
Twelve by Gordon R. Dickson the 
most tolerable. It has two excellent 



stories: “In the Bowl” by John 
Varley, and “The Bicentennial 
Man” by Isaac Asimov; and two 
equally good essays, “Science 
Fiction in the Marketplace” by 
Algirdas (Algis) Budrys and “The 
Academic Viewpoint” by James 
Gunn. 

The Varley story I have reviewed 
before. It is not his best, but pretty 
good. The Asimov, however, is 
breathtaking, if only because it has 
been so long since I read a good 
Asimov story I had forgotten how 
good he can be. It is probably the 
last of the “I, Robot” series, and 
the equal of any of them. A 
fascinating, moving tale of a robot 
' who wishes to be human. 

This is not a novel idea, but 
Asimov’s handling of it is brilliant. 
We are first introduced to 
“Andrew” as he is applying to a 



136 



GALAXY 



robot surgeon for an operation the 
machine fears will harm him. We 
learn that Andrew is a robot. The 
story flashes back to Andrew the 
machine. He is in service to a 
family with whom he has developed 
a close relationship, one that is to 
last their entire lives. It is 
discovered that Andrew has a 
special talent for making things. He 
is encouraged to try furniture, and 
he does so well at it he makes a 
fortune. 

At this point, he comes to his 
owner with a special request: he 
wants to buy his freedom. The 
owner is bewildered, but willing. 
The law, however, must be 
convinced. And after a court case, 
they are. Andrew is free. 

He finds that his freedom 
involves risks. There are no laws to 
protect the rights of a free robot 
from unscrupulous human beings. A 
bill is introduced into the legislature 
with the aid of Andrew’s wealth, 
and again, he wins. 

Afterwards, he virtually invents 
the -science of robobiology in an 
effort to transform himself into a 
human being; an act that requires 
another legislative battle before it is 
won. 

The story is really a series of 
short-shorts, nicely woven together. 
What makes them fascinating is the 
careful evolution of Andrew’s 
thinking from machine to man. 
Asimov has not simply taken a 
human character and called him a 
robot, but made Andrew 
wonderfully different and only 
gradually human. Part of his 
success depends on the constant 
contrast between him and his human 
family. They are. not complex 



people, but warm and alive. As 
intricate as the philosophical and 
legal aspects of the story become, 
Asimov never loses the story’s 
humanity. Nor is anything assumed. 
If this were to be the first robot 
story you had read, you would not 
be confused by any of the 
terminology. 

Less than first-rate is Charles L. 
Grant’s award-winning, “A Crowd 
of Shadows.” To me, this is a 
typical “award-winner, ” the kind of 
story people like Damon Knight and 
Harlan Ellison point to as evidence 
of science fiction’s maturation, the 
kind that is supposed to be 
comparable to anything in the 
mainstream. 

The narrator is an average, 
liberal-minded man who is 
vacationing on a resort world called 
Starburst. He meets an android in 
the shape of a boy whom he 
believes belongs to an elderly 
couple. The other guests are hostile 
to androids. The narrator is 
sympathetic, enraged at their 
bigotry. A series of murders occur, 
and the boy is suspected (for good 
reason). The guests become fearful 
and angry. Any one of them might 
be next. The narrator comes to 
share their hostility. One night the 
boy is killed on the beach by some 
men. It is discovered he is really 
human. The elderly couple are 
androids. They were his surrogate 
parents. 

Aside from calling the boy an 
android, we are told nothing about 
the nature- of androids. Their 
existence is assumed; their wonder 
and mystery irrelevant to Grant’s 
theme. Normal people are 
prejudiced against androids. Why? 



BOOKSHELF 



137 




Grant never tells us. The murders, 
committed by the boy, I imagine, 
have nothing to do with androids, 
or with the time and place of the 
story. They are acts of protest 
against an unfeeling world. The 
world itself is hardly described^ It 
could as well as be Miami Beach. 
In short, change “android” to 
black, and the time of the story to 
twenty years ago, and you have the 
same story. 

As in most “award- winners,” 
neither the theme nor the characters 
are in any way remarkable. By 
contrast with the Asimov story, one 
might say that Grant’s narrative 
technique is more sophisticated (i.e., 
more literary), but while both are 
working with familiar materials, 
Asimov’s style makes them seem 
fresh and alive, while Grant’s does 
not. 

The same is true, to a lesser 
extent, of Joe Haldeman’s 
“Tricentennial” and Thomas F. 
Mo,nteleone’s “Breath’s a Ware that 
Will Not Keep.” Both have familiar 
ideas given sophisticated literary 
treatment. Haldeman gives us a 
snapshot view of the narrative in 
short sequences dating from 1975 to 
2093, when the first starship reaches 
a distant world, thereby saving 
humanity from extinction. As with 
most Haldeman stories, we are 
left beaming with admiration at his 
extraordinary skill, but with no 
memory whatever of the characters. 

The Monteleone story is about an 
intelligent machine that goes 
berserk; or, more profoundly, about 
the relationship of man and 
machine: who is ultimately more 
human? Seems to have been a 
popular question in 1977. It 



provides a few suspenseful 
moments, but made no impact on 
me. 

Finally, there is James Tiptree, 
Jr.’s “Houston, Houston, Do You 
Read?” — which I could not. 

Gordon R. Dickson’s introduction 
is intelligent and interesting, if 
typical of these anthologies: 
“Hurray for Science Fiction!” 
According to Dickson, sf is the 
freest of all genre forms because it 
has no definite form, and therefore 
it is indefinable. It isn’t. Science 
fiction has its limits like any other 
genre, but they cannot be defined in 
terms of plot structure as can the 
mystery, but in terms of story 
elements. A science fiction story 
can have any plot structure as long 
as the integrity of the science fiction 
elements is preserved. Compare the 
Asimov and Grant stories. A 
science fiction story could well be 
plotless, as is Mission of Gravity, 
more or less. It is the elements 
themselves — time-travel, alien 
worlds, robots, future societies 
etc. — that are the real source of 
drama in a science fiction story, not 
the story itself. 

This is why I disagree with 
Budrys’s tsk-tsking of the 
predominance of story-oriented sf in 
the marketplace. So little genuine 
hard science fiction, like “The 
Bicentennial Man,” or Mission of 
Gravity, is written, that stories are 
the best the reader has to expect 
from the field. 

If we read a writer like James 
Jones, it is not because we like war 
novels necessarily, but because we 
like Jones. We don’t even think of 
From Here to Eternity as “a war 
novel.” But if we read a writer like 



138 



GALAXY 




Budrys, it is because we like 
science fiction. And even if he is 
our favorite writer, we read him as 
much for the sake of the experience 
of science fiction as for his own 
sake. In fact, it is his ability to 
communicate that experience so 
well that is surely the reason he is 
our favorite writer. 

If we read science fiction writers 
primarily because we love science 
fiction, it is the identity of science 
fiction, then, that is essential to us. 
We must be able to define it to 
ourselves, and the more distinct our 
definition, the more acute will be 
our pleasure in it. 

James Gunn’s “The Academic 
Viewpoint” is a defense of sf 
classes. He is not so concerned with 
defining the genre as he is with 
giving the students critical criteria 
with which to judge individual 
works. As a means of teaching 
criticism, it is interesting. But what 
does it have to say of science 
fiction? 

I can think of no better reason for 
a mature adult to read science 
fiction than because he or she 
enjoys it. Non-fiction is a much 
better source of ideas; the better 
mainstream literature is a 
considerably superior source of 
aesthetic pleasure. All the science 
fiction experience has to offer is 
itself. The experience of alien 
worlds and new technologies and 
far future adventures. For those who 
love it, it is enough. 

Yarbro’s Falsie 

In my review of Chelsea Quinn 
Yarbro’s Hotel Transylvania, I said I 
felt she would never amount to 



anything as a writer unless she 
developed a better dramatic sense, 
as well as a better sense of proportion. 
It is my pleasure to report that in 
her latest novel. False Dawn, she 
shows tremendous progress in both 
directions. 

It is exciting, suspenseful, 
colorful, and often tender. A book 
that is hard to put down. 

The scene is post-holocaust 
America, the west. A series of di- 
sasters has compounded our chronic 
pollution problems to eliminate 
most of humanity. There are 
plagues and famines. Endemic birth 
defects. Whole areas blanketed in 
lethal gases. Wild dogs run through 
the city streets. Venomous water 
spiders infest the lakes and rivers. 
There are colonies of mutants and 
lepers. And the weather itself has 
turned against us. A new ice age is 
dawning. 

Thea is alone. A viral mutation, 
designed to survive in this hostile 
world, and hopefully to save 
mankind with her offspring. She is 
making her way to Gold Spring 
where she has heard there is a 
refuge. An army of marauding 
hoodlums called the Pirates are the 
last organized force in the land. 
They spend their time pillaging 
towns and cities, exterminating 
“mutes,” as well as everyone else 
who gets in their way. 

Thea meets Evan Montague, the 
founder, and former head of the 
Pirates, who has been deposed by a 
blood-thirsty rival. It was Evan’s 
hope that the Pirates might restore 
order, but his wish to save the 
mutes was opposed, and he had his 
arm cut off with a buzzsaw and was 
left to die. What his rival did not 



BCX3KSHELF 



139 




know was that Evan, himself, was a 
mute. His arm, in time, grew back. 

Thea and Evan team up and 
struggle to reach Gold Spring. 
Aside from the ever-menacing 
Pirates, they are opposed by a 
homicidal cop, packs of wild dogs, 
a cannibalistic old woman, an order 
of monastic, fanatics who would 
bum them alive, and the cold of the 
winter. The last obstacle, the threat 
of freezing to death and 
slow-starvation, is the most 
harrowing of all. 

Dramatically, it is a consistently 
engrossing novel. Gone is the 
excess verbiage and unnecessary 
detail that made her last two novels 
tedious. Scenes are graphically 
described. Perhaps, to excess here 
and there, but the effect is gripping 
and not vulgar. Both Thea and Evan 
are characters worth caring about; 
and their opponents, with few 
exceptions, are realized vividly. 
Their journey is an arduous one, 
and Yarbro makes us feel for them 
every step of the way. Their 
relationship is treated sensitively. 
Their growing feeling for one 
another: their initial fear, their 

increased respect, and finally their 
love is handled beautifully. This is 
no stock-company romance between 
two stereotypes. 

Proportionately, there is a 
problem. 

From the moment a character 
comes on the scene, the reader 
begins visualizing him. If the 
character the reader is to visualize is 
to be the same one the writer 
envisioned, the writer must give all 
the pertinent information about the 
character as soon as possible. 
Yarbro does not do this. We don’t 



get all the facts about Evan and 
Thea until the last half of the book, 
and by that time, it is hard to 
reconcile them with their present 
characters. In fact, it is consistently 
hard to reconcile all the facts of the 
story. 

For instance, how many Pirates 
are there? Yarbro, at first, gives the 
impression that they are a 
nation-wide army; and yet in the 
end, Thea and Evan fight off a 
handful. And how did the world 
come to its pathetic end, anyway? 
She talks of pollution, and a series 
of man-made disasters, and plagues, 
but it is unclear how all this added 
up to doomsday. It is even unclear 
vi^ere they are. In a preface she 
says the reader may follow their 
route on a map, but as the country 
is unfamiliar to anyone who doesn’t 
live there, I was very confused. The 
publishers might have included a 
map. 

Thea, as I said, is a viral 
mutation. A product of a center that 
attempted to breed a new kind of 
humanity to cope with the disaster, 
but it is never clear in what way she 
is a mutant (except for a nictating 
membrane which descends at the 
most inappropriate moments), or 
how this was supposed to save her, 
or who the people of the center 
were, and what happened to them. 

Evan is the son of a famous 
conductor. Brilliant, well-read, 
well-traveled. He lost his parents in 
a cholera epidemic in London. But 
it is never clear how he got home 
again,, or how he became head of 
the Pirates. Nor is it clear how his 
rival took over, and why he left him 
with his arm cut off and didn’t 
finish the job. Nor is it clear why 



140 



GALAXY 




he is a mutant with the capacity to 
regrow an arm. 

But the book’s greatest weakness 
is its lack of originality. Anyone 
familiar with the post-holocaust 
stories of the 50’s — and God 
knows, there were hundreds of 
them — will find no surprises. It is 
the same landscape, only this time 
it is pollution instead of radiation. 
The same marauding bands, the 
same wild dogs, the same leper 
colonies, even the same religious 
fanatics. And Thea and Evan are 
pretty much the same hero and 
heroine. Even the names, 
“Pirates,” “Mutes,” etc. are the 
same. 

It is still fun to read, and the 
pollution-angle does give it a certain 
freshness, but I would hope this 
doesn’t revive the genre. 

Still, it is interesting to speculate 
on the apfjeal of this kind of story. 
Sf fans are supposed to be an 
optimistic lot, and yet nothing could 
be more depressing than an end of 
the world story. The final sentences 
of False Dawn suggest there is no 
hope. Humanity will vanish as if it 
had never existed. 

The point is worth considering, 
but has been considered so often, 
by so many different talents, over 
so many years, there must be more 
basic kinds of appeal to the story. 

I can see a number of them. For 
one thing, the end of the world 
results in a restoration of the Wild 
West, the frontier. Hardly the virgin 
land, but a hostile, alien landscape 
in which human fortitude is tested, 
and values regenerated. In many of 
these storfes, mankind is saved by a 
community of technicians (see Time 
Storm or Lucifer’s Hammer) who

practice a utilitarian ethic. 

In other types (such as Rebirth), 
humanity is saved by spectacular 
mutations which promise a new age 
for humanity. Always they are 
cerebral mutations, of course. 

These stories possibly reflect the 
belief shared by many intellectuals 
that man is a fallen angel, but rather 
than a fall from spiritual grace, he 
has fallen from rationalism. His 
culture has succumbed to 
commercialism, greed, the lust for 
power, and religion. 

The post-disaster story is, then, 
a second chance for humanity. A 
chance to separate the strong from 
the weak; a chance to rebuild the 
world along scientific guidelines. Or 
a chance to re-make a hopelessly 
inadequate mankind into a cerebral 
superman. 

In any case, it is a reduction of 
the world as we know it to its most 
basic terms: social darwinism. 

In another light, it is a 
microcosm of the alienated 
adolescent’s view of the world. 
Exactly the kind of adolescent who 
is most likely to read science 
fiction. The world is a hostile place 
filled with cruelty and ignorance, 
ideally suited for “mundanes,” 
mundanes being anyone not like 
themselves, especially physical 
types — who are always stupid, 
bigoted bullies; as are all religious 
people fanatics, all businessmen 
grasping, and all military types fas- 
cists. They, themselves, of course, 
are the exceptions. Their personifi- 
cations physically, as well as in- 
tellectually, differ, making them a 
target of discrimination. But their 
di^erences are really gifts, for they 
are very special people possessed of 



keen minds and acute insights, 
especially into the nature of power. 
They are people bom to do great 
deeds. 

All disaster stories are quests for 
a place to belong. Two or more 
gifted people make their way 
heroically across a hostile landscape 
to a special place where their own 
specialness will be allowed fhiition, 
for their quest for belonging is also 
a quest for efficacy. A place where 
their opinions, formerly scorned by 
the world, are viewed as wisdom, 
where their abilities, formerly 
neglected or suppressed by the 
world, are spectacularly successful. 

This is, perhaps, less true today 
than it was in the 50’s. Fans tend to 
be older today than they were then. 
Possibly adolescence lasts longer 
today than it did then. And they are 
less optimistic. Thea and Evan 
never find their special place. All 
that is left to them at the end of 
Chelsea Quinn Yarbro’s False 
Dawn is their love for one another. 

I wouldn’t mind at all if this 
book got a Hugo nomination. 

L. Sprague of Camp 

As I’ve said before, a form 
revitalizes itself by making new 
combinations of its elements. Use 
of the form for satire, or parody, 
suggest the form is decadant; but 
humor is a method for making 
familiar elements seem fresh. The 
problem with a humorous treatment 
is that it is a dead-end. Once the 
humor wears thin, there are no 
possibilities to build on, because the 
humor is derived from a 
demonstration of the limitations of 
the form. For instance, you can 
only use a phony magician, or a 



142 



GALAXY 




cowardly dragon, or an incompetenl 
knight so often before their novelty 
wears off, and then you can’t make 
an about-face and introduce a real 
magician, a genuinely fearsome 
dragon, and a Lancelot to carry on, 
because they contradict your initial 
premise. 

The same is true of the “novice 
hero among the barbarians” theme, 
which was introduced by Bur- 
roughs, and was never very good 
to begin with. It is based on the 
English class sytem idea of the 
superiority of the upper crust, and it 
never traveled well to America. 
Here we worship the cult of the 
professional. 

Examples of what I have been 
talking about undermine the success 
of L. Sprague de Camp’s The 
Hostage of Zir, the first Krishna 
novel in over a decade. 

The hero, Fergus Reith, is a 
former desk jockey who has been 
given the job as the first tour guide 
for Krishna by the Magic Carpet 
Travel Agency. He has never been 
away from Earth before, never 
wielded a sword, or had an 
adventure; but he is to endure all of 
them before the novel is over: 
escape a fanatic mob, have two 
duels with irate giants, be captured 
by bandits, and flee two beautiful 
young women, one of whom would 
make him a god, the other, a 
bridegroom. His charges include a 
black militant, two homosexuals, a 
nymphomania, and an all-around 
troublemaker. 

It sounds like a lively trip, and it 
is, at least at the beginning, but it 
wears thin by mid-point and 
becomes tedious by the end. The 
elements are overly familiar: Fergus 



Reith is no more convincing as a 
super-hero than any other; his 
charges are no more than amusing 
types, and rather offensively treated; 
his aliens are, like virtually all the 
elements in the book, comic book 
caricatures. De Camp’s humor alone 
saves the book from disaster, but 
the humor itself is familiar, a 
debunking of religion and authority 
and magic. 

The title itself. The Hostage of 
Zir, is misleading in that it is only 
one small episode in a book that is 
wholly episodic. And that is the 
principal reason for the novel’s 
weakness: it never amounts to 

anything more than a string of 
encounters. 

The Krishna series was begun 
back in (I believe) 1949, with The 
Queen of Zamba, a serial in 
Astounding, that has recently been 
re-issued by Davis Publications (A 
Dale Book). The rest of the stories, 
considerably superior to The 
Hostage of Zir, can be found in The 
Continent Makers (Signet, 1971). 
Two other Krishna novels. The 
Hand of Zei and The Tower of 
Zanid, also appeared back in the 
50’s. They are worth trying, 
although I found some of them 
tedious for reasons I explained at 
the beginning. De Camp tends to 
tell the same joke over and over. 

Nevertheless, it has been a 
popular series, and I would not be

Q.: Who likes short-shorts? 

A.: Asimov likes short-shorts. 

In his usual lively introduction, 
Isaac Asimov makes the following 



BOOKSHELF 



143 




points about the short story: “The 
longer the story, the more the 
author can spread himself . can 
indulge himself in plot and subplot 
with intricate interconnections 
. can engage in leisurely 
description, in careful character 
delineation, in thoughtful homilies, 
and philosophical discussions.” 
But, he says, .every story must have 
a point. “The reader may not 
consciously search for it, but he’ll 
miss it if it isn’t there.” In the 
short-short story, however, “there 
can be no subplots ... no time for 
philosophy; what description and 
character delineation there is must 
be accomplished with conci- 
sion . everything is eliminated 
but the point.” 

And that last point is 
well-attested to in the majority of 
the too Great Science Fiction Short 
Short Stories edited by Asimov, 
Martin Harry Greenberg, and 
Joseph D. Olander. 

The question arises, of course, if 
everything is eliminated except the 
point, what can the point consist of? 
The answer is a punch line. 

Asimov’s own story, “A Loint of 
Paw,” is a good illustration. A man 
steals over $100,000 and is 
apprehended the day after the 
statute of limitations has expired. 
What he did was to take the money, 
step into a time machine, and 
emerge seven years and one day 
after the event. 

The District Attorney claims 
“that the statute of limitations was 
not intended to be a game, (but) a 
merciful measure designed to 
protect a culprit from indefinitely 
prolonged fear of arrest.” As the 
villain has experienced no such 



fear, and is, in fact, only one day 
older than when he committed the 
crime, he should be judged guilty. 

The villain’s attorney argues that 
the letter of the law should apply. 

The decision is left with the 
judge, who in a suspenseful 
moment, delivers his verdict in a 
hilarious Asimovian pun. End of 
story. 

Everything has, indeed, been 
eliminated. There is no attempt to 
characterize the villain, or elicit the 
readers’ sympathy for him, except 
by demonstration of his 
ingenuity. There is no scientific 
justification of time travel. Simply, 
problem and resolution. 

But, as the story involves no 
emotional, interaction, so the point 
involves no emotional drama. The 
story is a joke; the point, the punch 
line. We laugh, and go on to the 
next. 

As the punch line is a funny one, 
we forgive Asimov for deceiving us 
into thinking he was writing a 
serious story; we forget our 
intellectual expectations, and we 
accept the story for what it is, not 
really a story at all, but an exercise 
in anarchy. 

The point of a short story, as in a 
novel, involves, the fulfillment of 
our expectations: positive, when the 
hero wins, negative, when he loses. 
These expectations are the work of 
the writer: he puts them into our 
minds, and their resolution almost 
always involves a moral. But when 
a writer contradicts his own created 
expectations, the effect is of 
anarchy., either for the sake of 
humor or philosophy. The moral is 
lost; all sense of human drama is 
gone; the point is an abstraction.

and therefore we don’t think 
whether the villain of Asimov’s 
story was right or wrong, or the 
judge’s decision flippant under the 
circumstances, or wonder what will 
happen next. The story has been 
frozen into a pun that ends all 
further consideration of dramatic 
possibility. We are left with nothing 
but admiration for the writer’s 
ingenuity. 

This is pleasant for a time, but 
the repeated experience of it is 
boring, which is why the effect of 
the majority of these stories is 
boring. It comes to seem more like 
a joke book than anything else. 

There are, of course, more 
skillful comedians than Asimov. 
Niven’s examples here are 
wonderful, especially “Mistake,” 
or Roger Zelazny’s hilarious 
“Collector’s Fever,” or Joe L. 
Hensley’s “Argent Blood.” None 
are such blatant examples of 
anarchic humor as Asimov’s. All 
contain sufficient background and 
characterization. And there are 
many more fine examples of what 
can be done with the form: 
Ambrose Bierce’s savage “The 
Ingenious Patriot,” Ben Bova’s 
only slightly less savage, “The 
System,” which should be rei^uired 
reading for all “ingenious patnots,” 
and “Zoo” by Edward D. Hoch, 
which, while it is very amusing, 
makes a very real point about how 
we look at one another. 

But as good as these are, the 
effect of this type of story is 
wearing, even if you only read a 
few of them at a time. Nor are there 
a sufficient number of serious 
stories as were to be found in the 
book of short-shorts that Asimov 



did with Groff Conklin years ago. 
There are a few such as Roger 
Zelazny’s chilling “Corrida,” or 
Joanna Russ’ lovely “Innocence.” 
Both are brief, relying heavily on 
suggestion. But, for me, the best 
example of what can be done with 
the short-short is Jerome Bixby’s 
“Trace.” 

It is not an anecdote or a joke, 
but a complete story with the point 
left for the reader to discern. A man 
takes a wrong turn on a country 
road and winds up in a lonely 
valley. He finds a house and a 
kindly old hermit who takes him in. 
The situation is thoroughly familiar. 
The mystery is the nature of the 
kindly old hermit. But rather than 
playing it for laughs or shock 
effect, Bixby maintains a restraint, 
feeding us subtle and ominous lines. 
The man leaves the house unaware 
of who the old man was or what an 
extraordinary experience he has 
had. 

Suggestion and subtlety are the 
real tests of the excellence of a 
short-short story. With them, a 
writer can do as much as he can do 
in a much longer story, but few 
possess that kind of talent. The 
short-short is the most common trap 
for amateurs, as any slush pile 
reader can tell you. Its success 
involves a concentration of dramatic 
elements that is almost always 
beyond their abilities. Yet, to judge 
from this book, most professionals 
misjudge the form as readily. The 
result is that they write “fillers” 
rather than stories. 

While I liked many of them, 1 
don’t think I would recommend 100 
Great Science Fiction Short Stories 
as a book. The editors could have

done far better by the form. I wish 
someone would. 

Of Mammaries and Monsters 

So far in this column, I have 
delved intrepidly into the artwork of 
Kelly Freas and Edd Cartier, and 
now 1 am about to embark on 
another coffee table safari into the 
wiles and wilds of Fantasy by 

Fabian, edited by Gerry de la Ree. 
Hardly enough data with which to 
concoct a theory of genre art. 

Nevertheless, I am learning. 

Like the western, fantasy is a 

literature whose success is 

dependent on its images. This is 
true of science fiction as well, but 
in a somewhat different way. In the 
western, it is the landscape that is 
the controlling reality. Its nature is 
such that the people who inhabit it 
seem to have sprung from it 
suitably clothed and equipped. In 
both fantasy and science fiction, the 
landscape is that of the mind rather 
than of the earth. 

The difference between them is 
the art of science fiction is an art of 
conscious, intellectual wonder; 
while that of fantasy is of the 
subconscious, dreamlike: an 

objectification of the unknown. 

Of the three artists, Cartier and 
Fabian are essentially decorative. 
Their work is immediate. Their 
images do not comment on life. 
There is little internal drama in 
them. For Cartier, the world is a 
whimsical fairyland; for Fabian, it 
has no predominant scheme. His 
work is imitative — a little Finlay 
here, a little Cartier there — but not 
uninteresting. 

In serious art or literature, the 



intention is to share a perception of 
reality that reconciles, or 
demonstrates the complexity, of the 
intellectual and emotional aspects of 
experience. In fantasy art, it is the 
experience itself that is the 
message. It is a shared dream, 
intended to arouse a specific and 
familiar feeling. In this, fantasy has 
the advantage over science fiction in 
that its images have an ancient 
tradition and a greater variety of 
appeals. Fantasy art can appeal to 
primitive fears and anxieties as well 
as childhood whimsy; science 
fiction art is bound to the intellect 
and the imagination. We cannot 
wonder unless we think about what 
we see. 

Fantasy is an objectification of 
the unknown, but that could be 
qualified by saying it is more 
accurately an objectification of the 
familiar unknown; those aspects of 
it such as ghosts, ghouls, and 
graveyards. It is their familiarity, 
rather than their novelty, that makes 
them interesting. A child looks at a 
monster, and sees what he believes 
to be a real creature, and therefore a 
threat. A more experienced child 
looks at a monster and sees a toy. 
The former experiences real fear; 
the latter, the detensified memory of 
fear. The former perceives reality; 
the latter ingenuity. He knows that 
the artist is trying to scare him, but 
he is not frightened, and yet he 
would like to be, within safe limits; 
so his perception becomes a 
collaboration with the artist, the 
success of which depends on the 
talent of the artist. 

Sex is as much an unknown as 
anything supernatural. Even to those 
familiar with it, it is a mysterious 



146 



GALAXY 




and disturbing power. Yet for all its 
very real terrors (impotence, 
illegitimacy, perversion, etc.), it is 
an irresistable source of wonder. 
Until recently, it has shared a 
kinship with fantasy in that society 
feared it as something unnatural, 
except in a specific context, and 
then by prescribed rules. For the 
adolescent, it seemed as if sex 
occupied another level of reality, a 
strange and mysterious place far 
removed from the everyday world. 
And, for the average adult, the 
situation was not much different. 
Sexual activity was so restricted that 
much of one’s sexual energy had to 
be expended in fantasy. 

It is not surprising, then, that 
virtually all of Fabian’s women are 
adolescent sexual fantasies. His 
book begins with a series he did for 
Gerry de La Ree, a portfolio of 
“Fantastic Nudes.’’ All the women 
are from the same cloth: 
long-haired, virtually all blonde, 
full-lips, penciled eyebrows, and 
with enormous bosoms, nipples 
erect, as if they were breast-feeding 
a child. Their faces are 
characterless. Typical pin-ups. 
There is usually a phallic symbol of 
some kind in the background, a 
sword or spear. A great muscular 
hero looks on sternly. The women 
sit in submissive postures intended 
to represent sensual appeal, but 
looking no more than like models 
posing. 

No matter. The adolescents who 
will admire them will see no more 
than their breasts and ample 
buttocks. There is no reality, no 
real sensuousness, to intrude or 
disturb. Arousal is all. 

Next follows an alphabet with 



Lovecraft images and quotations. I 
liked some of them very much (the 
cat of page 44 and the pilgrims of 
page 45 are marvelous, although the 
two other cat drawings in the book, 
familiars both, are more adorable 
than menacing); but for the rest, 
they are uneven, and often bland. 

There are his illustrations for 
“The Fire-Fiend,’’ a 19th century 
poetic hoax of Poe. They are 
talented and amusing, but two- 
dimensional and unaffecting. The 
first, an exterior of the house, 
however, is perhaps the best 
drawing in the book, a marvelous 
mood piece. Fabian is better at 
landscapes and buildings than he is 
at people. 

Following is a selection of 
drawings of Helen de la Ree, 
Gerry’s wife, in various fantasy 
settings, which are completely 
uninteresting; more alphabet art 
based on Finlay; and finally the 
most consistently interesting portion 
of the book, illustrations from 
Invocation, a quarterly fantasy 
magazine, which are published here 
for the first time. More bosomy 
vamps, but in a surprising variety of 
styles and images, the best of which 
can be seen on the back cover. 

It is not fair to judge Stephen 
Fabian’s work from this one book, 
which is not rgjresentative, but only 
a collection of what the editor had 
on hand; but from what I have seen 
of his work, the secret of his great 
popularity remains a mystery to me.

Dear Sirs: 



DIRECnONS 

Dear Sir: 

An attitude like Harlan Ellison's is 
the attempt to achieve by force and 
boycott what has not been achieved by 
the will of the people. This is not the 
idea that science fiction fans should 
share or, I believe, do share. 

Furthermore, if he were to speak 
under these conditions this would be 
exploited as ‘support’ for this type of 
view regardless of the view of the con- 
vention at large. 

Thus a substitute should be found as 
Guest of Honor. I might suggest Sam 
Nicholson whose story, “More Deadly 
Than the Male'.’’’ in the Analog Year- 
book viewed Women’s Lib very in- 
telligently. In any ease there must be 
time for opposing viewpoints. 

While he, like anyone, has and has 
had the right to express his views, he 
has no right to drag along an entire 
■convention with him.

I wouldn't want to see Harlan elimi- 
nated as guest of honor; I'm sure the 
fans want to see him — but you're cer- 
tainly free to show up in Phoenix and 
argue with him. One word of warning, 
though: unless you're Lester del Rey, 
your chances of winning an argument 
with Harlan are slim or none.' —j-j p- 



Harlan Ellison is a gentigman I ad- 
mire above all others. I’ve admired his 
writing for years. When 1 met him at 
that fiasco in Tucson last year I was 
impressed by the fact that he was articu- 
late, witty, principled, and not that 
short. However, his intent concerning 
the Iguanacon leaves me feeling uncom- 
fortable. My gut reation was that Harlan 
is capitalizing on the drawing power of 
his name to espouse a favorite cause, 
much like Jane Fonda, John Lennon 
and — yes — Robert Heinlein. 

I was distraut when Heinlein acted as 
he did at the Tucson Exposition. The 
fact that Heinlein (one of sf’s few true 
giants), in refusing to grant autographs 
to any who had not donated blood, was, 
in a sense coercing me and my fannish 
lusts. Objectivist that I am, I was quite 
reasonably outraged and got along with 
a few photographs. Please realize that 1 
understand why Heinlein supports blood 
donorship so zealously, as it saved his 
life. 

I also understand Harlan’s position, as 
well as his feelings. There are too few 
solidly principled individuals left in the 
world for me to actually condemn him, 
but I don’t feel that his intended actions 
are appropriately inflicted on a 
Worldcon, The Worldcon has developed 
into a respected and venerable science 
fiction institution and should not be 
used as a personal soap-box. It’s as ap- 
palling as Venessa Redgrave’s tacky bit 
of bullshit at the Oscars. 

Alas, 1 am left in a dilemma. While I 
respect and agree with Harlan’s .senti- 
ments in this issue, 1 will not allow my- 
self to partake of this particular cup of 
tea. This saddens me because the 
Iguanacon was to be the first Worldcon 
accessible enough for me to afford to at- 



148

tend, and I can't sec choosing between 
violating my principles and spending a 
week in a tent. So 1 guess I ’ll just have 
to wait for next year and hope I can 
make it to London.

Well, your willingness to forgo 
Iguanacon on principle is no doubt ad- 
mirable. And what will Harlan make of 
that? —j-j-P- 

Dear Mr. Pierce: 

It was with dismay and sadness that I 
read Harlan Ellison’s guest editorial in 
the May ’78 Galaxy. 

I have had very great respect for Elli- 
son’s remarkable ability as a fantasist in 
the past. He is without doubt one of the 
really great writers of speculative fan- 
tasy. He most certainly deserves the 
honor of being chosen WorldCon Guest 
of Honor. His courage and honesty are 
well known and his enormous talent is 
universally respected. 

However, this time Ellison is dead 
wrong. Not that he isn’t absolutely right 
about the importance of the passage of 
ERA. I, too, believe in the amendment 
and hope that it will pass. But this is 
not the way to help it! Might I also 
state that I think it to be in especially 
bad taste for Ellison to compare his ac- 
tion to that of Heinlein. They are not re- 
lated at all. 

Doesn’t Ellison realize that by his 
making the WorldCon a political plat- 
form to publicize his personal beliefs 
(even though most of us in fact agree 
with those same beliefs), he is using his 
fans? 



This is one long-time fan of his that 
wants to register the fact that he most 
strongly resents it.

Dear J.J.: 

An open response to Mr. Paul 
Walker, your book reviewer, on pp. 
139-40 of the May 1978 column. In 
specific, his comments re my story 
“Basilisk" in Joe Haldeman’s anthol- 
ogy STUDY WAR NO MORE; com- 
ments that go beyond the parameters of 
the work and slop over untidily into an 
analysis of the author. Risky business, 
that. 

I’m not certain one should bother giv- 
ing serious attention to the opinions of a 
man who has the chutzpah to say of 
Gordon Dickson — author of “Dolphin’s 
Way,” “Black Charlie,” “Call Him 
Lord” and “Home from the Shore” to 
name only four of the more breathtak- 
ingly damned-near-perfect stories this 
genuinely original talent has given us 
over the past three decades — and I 
quote directly: 

”... a writer for whom I had pre- 
viously had no respect for [sic] 
whatever. .” 

and who says something that unin- 
formed that ungrammatically, but since 
Mr. Walker has had either the bad luck 
or the stupidity, or both, to call me out 
on a subject where I am the only living 
authority ... the delicious opportunity

to kick a cripple is beyond my meager 
capacity for restraint. 

(It wasn't bad grammar, at least, on 
Paul's part, but a typo that got past 
me. —j-jP-) 

The subject is, of course, what I 
think. 

Now I realize it will dismay Mr. 
Walker to learn that his powers of tele- 
pathy are impaired, but when it comes to 
his putting words and thoughts into my 
mind, or extracting them from that itny 
place, he is filled right up to the 
eyeballs with ripe horse puckey. In 
short, what I’m saying is that Mr. 
Walker’s analysis of “Basilisk,” and by 
extension the motivating sensibility that 
produced that story, is purest twaddle. 
Amphigory, rot, tosh, nonsense. 

As a card-carrying, dues-paying 
member in good standing of the Na- 
tional Book Critics Circle, it is my 
pleasure to give Mr. Walker a much- 
needed lesson, in how to review a book. 
Excuse my humility. I take it as a pub- 
lic service. Social work among the in- 
tellectually deprived. Pay attention, Mr. 
Walker, and kindly stop moving your 
lips when you read. 

Let us begin the disembowelment 
working from the lesser to the greater. 
First your analysis of the story itself. 
Oh my. 

Setting aside the tardiness of Mr. 
Walker’s attention to “Basilisk,” a 
story first published in 1972 (to rather 
substantial critical praise), reprinted 
many times, and reviewed favorably as 
one of the cycle-stores in Deathbird 
Stories (1975, 76), and presuming Mr. 
Walker has read none of the academic 
studies of this particular work (notably 
Slusser’s five-page analysis in the 
Borgo Press 1977 monograph on my 



work, pp. 38-42), it is clear from inter- 
nal evidence that Mr. Walker simply 
does not understand what the story is 
about. 

“Basilisk” concerns itself, themati- 
cally, with the valid limits of in- 
stitutionalized patriotism, with the limits 
of self-sacrifice a soldier should set for 
himself, with the fickle nature of the na- 
tional pride a soldier serves as opposed 
to that nation’s treatment of the person 
upon his return from battle, and most 
specifically how love of country can be 
turned to hate when the soldier receives 
not approbation for his efforts but ostra- 
cism and revilement. Mr. Walker sees 
this story as a diatribe, racist in tone. 
As he puts it; “The race ... is White 
Anglo-Saxon Protestant American 
(working and middle classes variety 
[sic]) ...” 

Nonsense. Mr. Walker supposes on a 
sophomoric level. The story in no way 
deals with class. Patriotism cuts across 
class lines. The people in the story are 
obviously class/ess,- they are simply the 
residents of a small town. An entire 
small town is arrayed against the pro- 
tagonist, Lance Corporal Vernon Lestig, 
and quite the opposite of Mr. Walker’s 
wonky perception, social status of the 
townspeople is a consideration that 
never arises. 

Later in the Walker comments. I’m 
accused of always trying to be “cool,” 
whatever that means to Mr. Walker. Et- 
ernally cool is the phrase he uses. 1 
bring this up, out of sequence, because 
it ties in logically with Walker’s charac- 
terization of the writing as evincing 
“Ellisonian power and imagistic 
magic,” ‘-‘manic ferver,” “maniacal 
and revoltingly sadistic infatuation with 
violence,” “nightmare vision,” “an act 
of personal revenge upon humanity at 
large,” “makes us see through fierce 



150 



GALAXY 




alien eyes the reality of rage and vio- 
lence,” “white heat,” “the strongest 
possible dramatic effect,” “sheer inten- 
sity of language” — all this and more he 
says of the writing . and that I’m 
simply mad to be eternally cool. 

Far be it from me to suggest that Mr. 
Walker has puree of bat guano for 
brains, but if he can explain how all 
that crassilingual corybantism squares 
with “coolness,” I’ll buy him a terrific 
meal at The Mirage in Beverly Hills on 
the night of his choice (closed Mon- 
days). 1, and my work, have been ac- 
cused of many things in the past 
quarter-century, but I’ll be goddamed if 
“cool” has ever been one of them. 

But Walker uses this specious hip- 
pocket Freudian codswallop to buttress 
his argument that “Basilisk” is a 
panegyric eulogizing the brutalization 
and punishment of WASPs. Why, 
shucks, Mistuh Walkuh, some of mah 
bestest frens is WASPs. 

You see. I’m back in sequence again; 
if I’m trying always to be “cool” and 
contemporarily hip, to be against such 
convenient devils as bashing seals in the 
head with ball-bats and sexism and ra- 
cism and war and stupidity and the 
leavening-out of the human race at the 
level of McDonald’s toadburgers and 
Erich Segal novels, then I’m a shallow 
poseur, incapable of an honest artistic 
statement . which is precisely what 
Walker says of me. 

But if he’s wrong, as Joe Haldeman 
(who edited the anthology) and a gaggle 
of other critics have opined, then 
Walker is fulla ka-ka and he simply 
read into that story what he wanted to 
read into it, and knew what he was 
going to say before he sat down to do 
the reading. Lord knows, my personal 
boycott of states that haven’t ratified the 
Equal Rights Amendment gives him ter- 



rific ammunition; he must have read 
that editorial in the same issue with his 
review and puffed up like a pouter pi- 
geon. 

But for him to be correct in his 
skewed perception that “Basilisk” is a 
diatribe against the white middle-class, 
bom out of a cheap need to attack the 
currently unfashionable, then the story 
by all rights should have been, and 1 
quote Walker again, “. .the work of 
an unexamined consci- 

ence . (wo/ked) out at white heat” 
and then “he (Ellison) stops thinking 
about it.” But, sad to say, for Mr. 
Walker’s position, “Basilisk” was first 
conceived in 1960. Because “Basilisk” 
is based on Francis Gary Powers, the 
U-2 pilot shot down while spying on 
Russia by means of a high-altitude over- 
flight. It is based on the treatment that 
Powers received when he returned to his 
home town in Tennessee: hatred, ostra- 
cism, social and economic boycott, the 
debasement of his family forcing them 
to move away, forcing Powers into 
anonymity and a new identity. I was 
appalled at the bestiality of people con- 
sidered “good citizens.” I could not 
understand how they could applaud his 
having been a spy, then revile him for 
not having killed himself with the 
cyanide cap in his hollow back tooth. 1 
began thinking about how far “pat- 
riotism” should take someone. To his 
own death to protect an illegal act? 

Well, I worked on the idea, trying to 
codify my thoughts in terms of a con- 
temporary story, but it didn’t work. 
The closest I came to setting it down in 
the Sixties was as a story treatment for 
the Route 66 television series, on which 
I was working in 1962-3. But it didn’t 
work. So I set it aside. When the Viet 
Nam War began, the story came back to 
me. I need not go on at length about

my anti-war activities during the Sixties 
and early Seventies. Suffice to say, I 
was one of the people who, at the Mil- 
ford SF Writers Conference in 1968, in- 
itiated with Kate Wilhelm and Judith 
Meril and 79 others, the anti-war ad 
that ran in the June 1968 Galaxy (coin- 
cidentally, the issue in which “The 
Beat that Shoufed Love at the Heart of 
the World,” an ecology story, was pub- 
lished); I worked with the Veterans 
Against the War Committee; I did col- 
lege lectures on the war; 1 supported in 
a number of ways the defense of the 
Kent State kids; 1 had my arm busted 
by cops at the Century City riot protest- 
ing the War when Johnson came to 
speak; and in many other ways vali- 
dated my contention that insofar as the 
“unpopular cause” of protesting the 
War was concerned, I displayed any- 
thing but an “unexamined conscience.” 
But though 1 had written anti-war 
stories as far back as 1958, when 
“Battlefield” was published (under the 
editor’s title' “His First Day at War”) in 
the November 1958 issue of Space 
Travel, “Soldier” in Fantastic Universe 
for October 1957, and “Asleep: With 
Still Hands” in If for July 1968 ... I 
did not deal directly with my obsession 
about the Powers/U-2 matter until the 
moment 1 wrote “Basilisk.” 

Then, having examined my consci- 
ence endlessly for fifteen years, I wrote 
what many people thought was a very 
unpatriotic story. It dealth with the un- 
fairness of bloodthirsty non-combatants 
sitting on their suburban asses while 
sending off others to die for them, and 
then treating them like shit when they 
didn’t do the “honorable” thing by kil- 
ling themselves rather than surviving at 
whatever the cost of self-humiliation. 

No, Mr. Walker has managed to as- 
sault my work and the integrity I try to 



bring to it, at precisely the point where 
I have solid credentials. “Basilisk” 
may have been written quickly, may 
even have been written af “white heat” 
as he suggests; but it was written with a 
decade and a half of examined consci- 
ence behind it. 

I offer these credentials to anyone 
who cares to examine them, and to re- 
fute logically the moronic assertions 
Mr. Walker proffers as telepathic in- 
sights into my phoniness, duplicity, and 
lack of artistic honesty. Mr. Walker, 
were he not a recycled fan, with the 
tunnel vision and adolescent opinions 
one finds in the shallowest fan be- 
havior, could easily have apprised him- 
self of these facts. Were he a serious 
book critic, rather than a refugee from a 
fanzine, he would understand that a re- 
viewer can only judge a work from 
internal evidence, that presuming to 
plumb the mind of the author is^ a 
mugg’s game, and a dishonest game at 
that. 

One final point. Mr. Walker says of 
me, “Without flattering him (Ellison, 
that is), he seems to be more interested 
in being than in having been.” Now I 
haven’t a clear idea what the hell that 
nonsense sentence means, but if Walker 
feels that a writer should divorce him- 
self from the times in which he lives, 
that he should rest on past actions and 
beliefs rather than changing and grow- 
ing as life progresses, then 1 submit 
Walker isn’t fit to review anyone’s 
work, much less the work of those who 
try to stay au courant and committed. 
For me, and for my work, the words of 
Oliver Wendell Holmes seem most 
appropriate: “I think that, as life is ac- 
tion and passion, it is required of a man 
that he should share the passion and ac- 
tion of his time at peril of being Judged 
not to have lived.”

There is yet another quote, that in- 
forms my work eternally: 

“Society and man are mutually de- 
pendent enemies' and the writer’s job 
[is] to go on forever defining and de- 
fending the paradox — lest, God for- 
bid, it be resolved. ” 

— Arthur Miller, 1974 

These are parlous times for me. I 
have taken a number of unpopular and 
inconvenient positions on matters of 
universal and genre concern. Unpopular 
and inconvenient for those who accuse 
me of being a flag-waver, a poseur. 
Somehow, though these attitudes on my 
part have netted me virtually nothing 
but insult and death threats (oh yes, 
friends, fans are capable of death 
threats; what I doubt is that they have 
the guts to do anything beyond write 
anonymous letters or make dead-of- 
night phone calls), these same critics 
twist rationality to opine that I'm mak- 
ing myself a fashionable writer by this 
means. They seem to think that by an- 
gering and alienating my readers I will 
widen and deepen my readership. And 
so fools like Walker cobble up irrational 
analyses that say an anti-war, anti- 
patriotism story is an attack on the 
poor, beleaguered WASP middle class. 
But it’s all of a piece, and all goes to 
the heart of discrediting the messenger 
because the message is a troublesome 
one. Leads me to remember a stanza 
from Fran9ois Villon’s “The Testa- 
ment”; 

His gall breaks on his heart 
And he sweats God knows what 
sweat 

And no one can lighten his pain 
He hasn’t child, brother, or sister 
Willing to stand in for him then. 



And though there will always be, 
among the dear and good and intelligent 
I’ve met who happen, coincidentally, to 
be fans, a few smug, presumptuous and 
arrogantly ignorant natterers, like Mr. 
Walker, who isn’t fit to carry Gordy 
Dickson’s pencil case, I will continue to 
serve the demands of my own ethics. 

Less than that, neither my devotion to 
my work nor the everlasting examina- 
tion of my conscience will permit me.

P.S. There will no doubt be those who, 
reading this response, feel I’ve been un- 
conscionably rude to Mr. Walker. I’m 
always bemused by the backlash reac- 
tion.- It is one with Mr. Walker’s “pity 
the poor WASP” routine. Pity the poor 
males being assailed by feminists; pity 
the poor slavemasters under attack by 
the darkies; pity the poor mass murderer 
being jailed for his crimes; let’s stop 
kicking poor old Tricky Dick around. 
Well, to them as feels that way, I say 
as follows, in the words of “polite” 
Mr. Walker: if you are doing what is 
ostensibly a review of my writing, then 
don’t shoot off your mouth and call me 
maniacal, phony, infatuated with vio- 
lence and lots of etcetera, unless you 
want me to respond in kind. 

For those of you unfamiliar with Mr. 
Ellison’s epistolary career, the preced- 
ing is a carbon copy of the letter he has 
been publishing regularly in fanzines for 
the past 10 or 15 years. All the vituper- 
ation, the protestations of innocence, 
the recitation of his credentials are the 
same: only the names of the critic and 
the story criticized have been changed. 
This is, however, the most brilliant 



DIRECTIONS 



153 




example of the genre I have read. 

What can l_say? 

What was true of Mr. Ellison's story 
is true of his letter. 

— Paul Walker 

Dear JJ; 

Paul Walker is the most uneven re- 
viewer I’ve ever seen. His treatment of 
my own In The Ocean of Night was 
fumbling, I thought; he missed most of 
what was going on in the book. But his 
analysis of Ellison's work in this issue 
is brilliant. He illuminates the nagging 
doubts I’ve had about Ellison’s mount- 
ing of the ramparts, by showing how in- 
tolerant Harlan is toward that much- 
maligned minority, Anglo Saxon Protes- 
tants, in “A Boy and His Dog.” In this 
sense I think Ellison sometimes deprives 
his visions of their full f)ower. He 
plainly feels some of that stuff, but the 
question is whether it means very much. 
His lasting work will probably not be 
the more fireworky. 

Still, I should add that while Walker 
illuminates Ellison’s work somewhat. 
I’m sure there is more to be said; he has 
only shown a facet of Ellison’s work — 
the man himself is larger.

Dear Sir: 

Thank you very much for the appear- 
ance of the Cordwainer Smith story, 
“The Queen of the Afternoon.” 

Your comments prefacing each 
story in the anthology The Best of 
Cordwainer Smith were very interesting 



without detracting from the magnificent 
tales, and I would have greatly ap- 
preciated similiar information about this 
one. For instance, did his 'wife have 
much to do with it? Why was its publi- 
cation delayed? Was there any particular 
story form employed? 

However, my biggest question is also 
my simplest: Will there be more? I 
know several people who bought that 
issue who have not purchased an sf 
magazine for years. (As a regular reader 
of Galaxy I just considered it a mar- 
velous and unearned bonus). 

As a couple of added comment re- 
garding your term as Editor, your 
choice of stories is interesting. 1 thought 
a couple of the shorter ones might be 
sharper in resolution, and I miss the ar- 
tists Galaxy used to use. However, 1 
still think Galaxy is far better than 
Analog and F&SF, both of which, 
especially the former, are very predict- 
able. Thank you for your efforts and 
your time and attention, and, hoping for 
more Cordwainer Smith stories, I look 
forward to many years of excellent sf 
from Galaxy under your direction. 

Sincerely, 
Frank Ramirez

“The Queen of the Afternoon” was 
begun by Paul Linebarger in 1955; but 
for some reason, he never finished it. 
“Mark Elf” the closely related story 
published in 1957, was written in 1956. 
Both stories were intended as parts of a 
mini-trilogy about the three VomAcht 
sisters and how they returned to Earth. 
Genevieve Linebarger completed “The 
Queen of the Afternoon” last fall, and

has since written the third story in the

Paul’s plans for the story. —j j p- 

Mr. Pierce; 

I am a regular reader of Galaxy, 
and such my reading style is to begin 
with the features and go on to the 
stories. Your feature section of course 
contains your Directions column so it 
is one of my first stops. 

Now to my point. Being a Star Wars 
fan I have read every word you’ve 
printed about it. I refer to Star Wars — 
Pro and Con. I’ve seen Star Wars a 
total of five times, and I’ve enjoyed it 
each time. And while enjoying it. I’ve 
never taken it to be science fiction. It is 
obviously (to me) Space Fantasy. The 
only thing in Star Wars I can find to be 
sci-fi-ish is the Force. 

1 look at Star Wars as a beginning for 
Hollywood, a welcome one. Just as the 
pulp fiction evolved into what we have 
today. Star Wars (meaning Hollywood) 
will evolve untill they finally reach the 
point of Heinlein, Asimov, Anderson, 
Simak, Ellison (1 could name a pageful 
but what’s the point?). 1 believe Hol- 
lywood has started the same path that 
magazines and books have already fol- 
lowed, and I know Hollywood People, 
there are two choices: either they will 
stay with the path and begin to produce 
good science fiction (Forbidden Planet 
was a fluke), or it will once again 
diverge from common sense and turn 
out stuff to equal Lost in Space (if they 
follow the latter course, I really believe 
we should try our best to ignore them). 

As I said before, however, I think 
this is a start toward good science fic- 
tion. There is. I’m afraid going to be a 
barrage of cheap, trashy junk purveyed 
to us in the near future — alleged sci- 



ence fiction trying to band-wagon on 
the success of Star Wars and Close En- 
counters of the Third Kind (which I 
haven’t as yet had the opportunity to 
see). 

It is inevitable that Studio Executives 
will see that there intelligent adults out 
here that want to see science fiction that 
doesn’t insult them. And when that 
happens we must be ready to give every 
movie that comes out of Hollywood a 
chance, either to prove itself or demon- 
strate its weaknesses. 

It is encouraging to hear that 
Paramount Studios are going ahead with 
a Star Trek project — with Gene Rod- 
denbeny at the head. Television too is 
coming out with movies and pilots for 
sci-fi series. NBC is even considering 
Stranger in a Strange Land! While I’m 
hopeful about that last one I mentioned, 
I see little possibility that it will remain 
the story we’ve come to know and love 
(unless they don’t let any censors near 
it). Let’s not forget that it is our respon- 
sibility to let Studio Executives know 
what we like. We can write enthusiastic 
letters praising those projects we’ve en- 
joyed, and stay ominously silent about 
anything we ate insulted by. 

In another direction, I never saw 
Kubrick’s 2001 : A Space Odyssey in a 
theatre, but I saw it when it was tele- 
vised recently. Aside from the opticals 
and photography it bored me. It re- 
minded me of a movie I saw in high 
school that was a simple catalog of ex- 
pected technological advances. The only 
part 1 found to be Science Fiction was 
the Hal 9000 computer.

Ordinarily, I wouldn't run another 
Star Wars letter. But unlike most who 
send them, you're bright enough to re- 
alize that the important thing is: what 
happens next? Perhaps the box-office 
disasters of turkeys like Damnation 
Alley and Starship Invasions, combined 
with the huge success of Star Wars, will 
finally get the message through. One 
can at least hope we won't be subjected 
to further insults like Harlan Ellison 
being called in by a major studio and 
asked to script a giant ant movie! — j.j.p. 

Gentlemen: 

I am writing to offer my heartiest 
congratulations to Jeff Rovin on his re- 
view of Close Encounters of the Third 
Kind. After his opinion of Star Wars 
coincided so neatly with my own, it 
seemed almost too much to ask that he 
would agree with me on Close Encoun- 
ters as well. 

Jay Kay Klein’s comparison of Star 
Wars and The Jazz Singer, so appa- 
rently fatuous on the surface, is prob- 
ably much more apt than he could pos- 
sibly have known (it is obvious Klein 
has never seen The Jazz Singer; it was 
neither all talking nor all singing.). 
After all. The Jazz Singer, in its day, 
was a trite, cliche-ridden, hackneyed 
story, produced without imagination or 
creativity, but with a kind of mechani- 
cal novelty that caught on with the au- 
diences of the time, and made the film 
a smash hit. There were great silent 
films released after The Jazz Singer, 
such as Keaton’s The Cameraman and 
Chaplin’s City Lights. Such films are 
still widely seen today, but no one ever 
goes to see The Jazz Singer. And with 
good reason; it’s a lousy movie. It al- 
ways was. In fifty years, I have no 
doubt, the reputation of Star Wars will 



rest with people who have not seen it, 
just as The Jazz Singer's reputation rests 
with people like Jay Kay Klein today.

Mr. Pierce: - 

After reading the editorial in your 
March issue, I wonder: was it a “call to 
arms” or a “trooper’s lament?” If you 
really believe that we slothful sf fans 
can change things (maybe for the better) 
why don’t you put a few pages of your 
magazine where your mouth is? Give us 
a “Directory of Idiots” and list the 
names, addresses, and crimes, if any, of 
the people you seem to be speaking 
against. Hell, let’s face it. The re- 
sources of a magazine far outweigh 
those of most individuals. You’re right, 
I sure don’t know who my congressman 
is. Why should I? He doesn’t know me, 
and I never voted for him. 1 don’t know 
the people responsible for those sixty- 
odd permits needed to start a nuclear 
power plant, either. I’m not even sure 
exactly which government agency is 
supposedly responsible for regulating 
them. 

Obviously, you do know. So why not 
share your wealth of knowledge? If you 
want change, act as the lever. Pournelle 
wails about research scientists getting 
laid off as the fusion works wind down. 
Who’s responsible? Voters in general? 
The “Public?” Or is it some agency 
that doesn't think it wise to invest in re- 
search when welfare dollars buy so 
many more votes? Name names. I can 
promise you this: for every name you 
DO give, 1 personally will spend I3e 
and write a letter. It may only be 
“Pierce, you idiot, this guy I agree

with!” but it will be written. (For that, 
would an old picture postcard of Niagara 
Falls do?) 

Enough bitching. On to other things. 

Star Wars was science fiction. So 
was 200 J . So was Forbidden Planet. So 
was Frankenstein. Each of these marked 
a major turning point. It is a sad com- 
mentary when the majority of what has 
been done is on the level of The Incred- 
ible Fifty Foot Woman. Or Wild Wild 
Planet. I’m really getting sick of people 
dissecting every movie made. So you 
didn’t like Star Wars. Or 2001. Look 
around. Do you see anything better 
being made today? If not, maybe you 
would like to get the chance to. The 
(sometimes modest) success of ANY 
science fiction movie is a definite plus 
for the entire field. Remember: without 
Star Wars we would never have gotten 
Quark. 

Speaking of which . “space bag- 
gies?” I saw the pre-showing publicity. 
A SYT (sweet young thing) said ‘Tve 
just seen the future, and it’s funny.” I 
must agree. Hysterical, no. Funny, yes. 
1 don’t know if space baggie T-shirts 
will ever be “in.” but I can readily 
imagine some alien walking up to a 
McDonald’s with a disposable single 
molecule protein container. What ever 
happened to the good old days when the 
female android in Logan's Run said 
“I’ll check the main power supply” 
eight times in three minutes? Who said 
science fiction was devoid of humor and 
sex? ‘Cau.se if the idea of a FEMALE 
android ain’t both funny and sexy, I 
don’t know what is. A male android, on 
the other hand, is merely dull. (The 
idea being, of course, that androids — 
real PROPER androids — are not only 
sterile but sexless. Anything else is 
merely a human being, dog or equiva- 
lent grown in a test tube.)

GALAXY 





"Dizzying Virtuosity 

and just damned good!” said Harlan Ellison 
about John Varley’sfirst novel, THE OPHIUCHI 
HOTLINE. The nine stories in THE PERSISTENCE 
OF VISION— many about a bizarre future in which 
genetic engineering, sex changes and arcane 
pleasures and trades are commonplace— display 
that originality in all its breathtaking brilliance.
