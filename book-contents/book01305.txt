What 3i 



and 




F ans read science fiction. Fans 
write letters to science-fiction 
magazines. Fans publish magazines 
of their own — hold conventions 
— organize into clubs. 

Fans also — and this is something 
that every professional writer or edi- 
tor in the field, as well as every 
reader, is endlessly indebted to them 
for — do an enormous amount of 
cataloguing, bibliographing and or- 
ganizing of literary fragments. Are 
you a Burroughs fan? Would you 
like to know the name and publish- 
er of every story Edgar Rice Bur- 
roughs ever wrote? It’s all in books 
and magazines prepared by fans. Is 
there a forty-year-old science-fiction 
novel you’d like to track down? You 
can find it in Bleiler and Dikty’s 
The Checklist of Fantastic Lit era- 
ture . Care to locate any science-fic- 
tion story? Don Day’s Index to the 
Science Fiction Magazines covers 
everything up to 1950 — other 
lists and supplements carry the in- 
dexing rght up to the present 
day. 

These are hobby books for read- 
ers and collectors . but they’re 
something more than that, too. They 
are the basic tools for a good many 



professionals. And we’re very grate- 
ful! 

Newest of these Things That 
Fans Do is what looks like the big- 
gest of them all. 

It is called A Checklist of Sci- 
ence-Fiction Anthologies , large size, 
some 373 pages. It covers more 
than two hundred anthologies — 
including some 2700 stories by over 
500 writers — published between 
1927 and 1963. Most are U.S.A. in 
origin, but France and England 
are represented too. It is compiled 
by W.R. Cole (with an introduction 
by Theodore Sturgeon), and it is an 
impressive job. 

Perfect? No, it’s not perfect 
Some stories are unaccountably 
missing. Some anthologies have been 
left out. Once or twice there is a 
plain slip, like listing a story under 
one member of a collaborating team 
and forgetting to list it under the 
other. 

But k’s the best of its kind — al- 
most the only of its kind — and well 
be using it over and over in years 
to come, we know. 

That’s the kind of things fans do 
that endear them most of all to 
pros! —THE EDITOR

STONE PLACE 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



If was « fanta s tic place to tight a 
space war — where a million orbiting 
rocks could conceal an alien ambushl 



1 

E arth’s Gobi spaceport was per- 
haps the biggest in all the small 
corner of the galaxy settled by So- 
larian Man and hk descendants; at 
least, so thought Mitdiell Spain, who 
had seen most of those ports in his 
twenty-four years of life. 

But looking down now from the 
crowded, descending shuttle, he 
could see almost nothing of the 
Gobi’s miles of ramp. The vast 



crowd below, meaning only joyful 
welcome, had defeated its own p» 
pose by forcing back and breaking 
the police lines. Now the vertical 
string of descending shuttle-ships 
had to pause, searching for enough 
clear room to land. 

Mitchell Spain, crowded into the 
lowest shuttle with a thousand other 
volunteers, was paying little atten- 
tion to the landing problem for the 
moment. Into this jammed compart- 
ment, once a luxurious observation 



6 




lounge, had just come Johann Kari- 
sen himself; and this was Mitch’s 
first chance for a good look at the 
newly appointed High Commander 
of Sol’s defense, though Mitch had 
ridden Karlsen’s spear-shaped flag- 
ship all the way from Esteel. 

Karlsen was no older than Mitch- 
ell Spain, and no taller, his short- 
ness somehow surprising at first 
glance. He had become ruler of the 
planet Esteel largely through the in- 
fluence of his half-brother, the 
mighty Felipe Nogara; but he held 
that rule by his own talents. 

“This field may be blocked for 
the rest of the day,” Karlsen was 
saying now, to a cold-eyed Earth- 
man who had just come aboard the 
shuttle from an aircar. “Let’s have 
the ports open, I want to look 
around.” 

Glass and metal slid and reshaped 
themselves, and sealed ports became 
small balconies open to the air of 
Earth, the fresh smells of a living 
planet — open, also, to the roaring 
chant of the crowd a few hundred 
feet below: “Karlsen! Karlsen!” 

As the High Commander stepped 
out onto a balcony to survey for 
himself the chances of landing, the 
throng of men in the lounge made 
a seemingly involuntary brief surg- 
ing movement, as if to follow. These 
men were mostly Esteeler volunteers, 
with a sprinkling of adventurers like 
Mitchell Spain, the Martian wan- 
derer who had signed up on Esteel 
for the battle bounty Karlsen offer- 
ed. 

“Don’t crowd, outlander,” said 
a tall man ahead of Mitch, turning 
and looking down at him. 



“I answer to die name of Mitchell 
Spain.” He let his voice rasp a 
shade deeper than usual “No move 
an outlander here than you, I 
think.” 

The tall one, by his dress and ac- 
cent, came from Venus, a planet 
terraformed only within the last cen- 
tury, whose people were sensitive 
and proud in newness of indepen- 
dence and power. A Venerian might 
well be jumpy here, on a ship filled 
with men from a planet ruled by 
Felipe Nogara’s brother. 

“Spain — sounds like a Martian 
name,” said the Venerian in a 
milder tone, looking down at Mitch. 

M artians were not known for 
patience and long suffering. 
After another moment the tall one 
seemed to get tired of locking eyes 
and turned away. 

The cold-eyed Earthman, his face 
somehow familiar to Mitch, was 
on the communicator, probably to 
the captain of the shuttle. “Drive 
on toward the city; cross the Khosu- 
tu highway, and let down there.” 
Karlsen, back inside, said: “Tell 
him to go no more than about ten 
kilometers an hour; they seem to 
want to see me.” 

The statement was matter-of-fact; 
if people had made great efforts to 
see Johann Karlsen, it was only 
die courteous thing to greet them. 

Mitch watched Karlsen’s face, and 
then the back of his head, and the 
strong arms lifted to wave, as the 
High Commander stepped out again 
onto the little balcony. The crowdli 
roar doubled. 

Is that all you feel, Karlsen, a 



STONE PLACE 



I 




wish to be courteous? Oh, no, my 
friend, you are acting. To be greeted 
with that thunder must do something 
rital to any man. It might exalt him; 
possibly it could disgust or frighten 
him, friendly as it was. You wear 
well your mask of courteous nobility, 
High Commander. 

What was it like to be Johann 
Karlsen, come to save the world, 
when none of the really great and 
powerful ones seemed to care too 
much about it? With a bride of 
famed beauty to be yours when the 
battle has been won? 

And where was brother Felipe to- 
day? Scheming, no doubt, to get 
economic power over yet another 
planet. 

With another shift of the little 
mob inside the shuttle the tall Vene- 
rian moved from in front of Mitch 
who could now see clearly out the 
port past Karlsen. Sea of faces, the 
old cliche, this was really it. How 
to write this . Mitch knew he 
would someday have to write it. If 
all men’s foolishness was not per- 
manently ended by the coming bat- 
tle with the unliving, the battle boun- 
ty should suffice to let a man write 
for some time. 

Ahead now were the bone-colored 
towers of Ulan Bator, rising beyond 
their fringe of suburban slideways 
and sunfields a highway, and bright 
multicolored pennants, worn by the 
aircars swarming out from the city 
in glad welcome. 

Police aircars were keeping pace 
protectively with the spaceship, 
though there seemed no possible 
danger from anything but excess 
enthusiasm. 



Another, special, aircar approach- 
ed. The police craft touched it brief- 
ly and gently, then drew back with 
deference. Mitch stretched his neck, 
and made out a Carmpan insignia 
on the car. It was probably their 
ambassador to Sol, in person. The 
space shuttle eased to a dead slow 
creeping. 

Some said that the Carmpan 
looked like machines themselves, 
but they were the strong allies of 
Earth-descended man in the war 
against the enemies of all life. If 
the Carmpan bodies were slow and 
squarish, their minds were visionary; 
if they were curiously unable to use 
force against any enemy, their in- 
direct help was of great value. 

S omething near silence came over 
the vast crowd as the ambassa- 
dor reared himself up in his open 
car; from his head and body gan- 
glions of wire and fiber stretched to 
make a hundred connections with 
Carmpan animals and equipment 
around him. 

The crowd recognized the mean- 
ing of the network; a great sigh 
went up. In the shuttle men jostled 
one another trying for a better view. 
The cold-eyed Earthman whispered 
rapidly into the communicator. 

“Prophecy!” said a hoarse voice, 
near Mitch’s ear. 

“ — of Probability!” come the 
ambassador’s voice, suddenly ampli- 
fied, seeming to pick up the thought 
in mid-phrase. The Carmpan Proph- 
ets of Probability were half mys- 
tics, half cold mathematicians. Karl- 
sen’s aids must have decided, or 
known, that this prophecy was go- 





STONE PLACE 





inn to he a favorable, inspiring 
thing winch the crowd should hear 
and had ordered the ambassador’s 
yoice picked up on a public address 
system. 

“The hope, the living spark, to 
spread the flame of life!” The inhu- 
man mouth chopped out the words, 
which still rose ringingly. The arm- 
like appendages pointed straight to 
Karlsen, level on his balcony with 
the hovering aircar. “The dark metal 
thoughts are now of victory, the 
dead things make their plans to 
kill us all. But in this man before 
me now, there is life greater than 
any strength of metal. A power of 
life, to resonate — in all of us. I 
see — with Karlsen — victory — ” 

The strain on a Carmpan prophet 
in action seemed always to be im- 
mense, just as his accuracy was al- 
ways high. Mitch had heard that 
tfie stresses involved were more 
topological than electrical. He had 
heard it, but like most Earth- des- 
cended, had never understood it. 

“Victory,” the ambassador repeat- 
ed. “Victory . and then . .” 

Something changed in the non- 
Solarian face. The cold-eyed Earth- 
man was perhaps expert in reading 
ilien expressions, or was perhaps 
taking no chances. He whispered 
another command, and the ampli- 
fication was taken from the Carm- 
pan voice. A roar of approval 
mounted up past shuttle and aircar, 
from the great throng who thought 
the prophecy complete. But the am- 
bassador was not finished, though 
now only those a few meters in 
front of him, inside the shuttle, 
could hear his faltering voice. 



. then death, destruction, fail- 
ure.” The square body bent, but 
the alien eyes were still riveted on 
Karlsen. “He who wins everything 
— will die owning nothing . .” 

The Carmpan bent down and his 
aircar moved away. In the lounge 
of the shuttle there was silence. 
The hurrahing outside seemed to 
have a tone of mockery. 

After long seconds, the High 
Commander raised his voice: “Men, 
we who heard the finish of the 
prophecy are few — but still we are 
many, to keep a secret. So I don’t 
ask for secrecy. But spread the 
word, too, that I have no faith in 
prophecies that are not of God. The 
Carmpan have never claimed to be 
infallible.” 

The gloomy answer was unspoken, 
but almost telepathically loud among 
the group. Nine times out of ten, 
the Carmpan are right. There will 
be victory, then death and failure. 

But did the dark ending apply 
only to Johann Karlsen, or to the 
whole cause of the living? The men 
in the shuttle looked at one anoth- 
er, wondering and murmuring. 

T he shuttles found space to land, 
at the edge of Ulan Bator. 
Disembarking, there was no chance 
for gloom, with the joyous crowd 
growing thicker by the moment 
around the ships. A lovely Earth 
girl came wreathed in garlands, to 
throw a flowery loop around Mitch- 
ell Spain, and to kiss him. He was 
an ugly man, quite unused to such 
willing attentions. 

Still, he noticed when the High 
Commander’s eye was on him. 




“You, Martian, come with me to 
the General Staff meeting. I want 
to show a representative group in 
there so they’ll believe Esteel is 
cosmopolitan. I need one or two 
who were born in Sol’s light.” 
“Yes, sir.” Was there no other 
reason why Karlsen had singled him 
out? They stood together in the 
crowd, two short men looking level- 
fy at each other. One ugly and 
flower-bedecked, his arm still around 
a girl who stared with sudden 
awed recognition at the other man, 
who was magnetic in a way beyond 
handsomeness or ugliness. The ruler 
of a planet, perhaps to be the savior 
of all life. 

“I like the way you keep peo- 
ple from standing on your toes in 
a crowd,” said Karlsen to Mitchell 
Spain. “Without raising your voice 
or uttering threats. What’s your 
name and rank?” 

Military organization was vague, 
in this war where everything that 
lived was on the same side. “Mitch- 
ell Spain, sir. No rank assigned, yet. 
I’ve been training with the marines. 
I was on Esteel when you offered a 
good battle bounty, so here I am.” 
“Not to .defend Mars?” 

“I suppose, that too. But 1 might 
as well get paid for it.” 

Karlsen’s high-ranking aides were 
wrangling and shouting now, about 
groundcar transportation to the 
Staff meeting. This seemed to leave 
Karlsen with time to talk. He 
thought, and recognition flickered on 
his face. 

“Mitchell Spain? The poet?” 

“I — I’ve had a couple of things 
published. Nothing much . .” 



“Have you combat experience?” 

“Yes, I was aboard one berserker, 
before it was pacified. That was 
out — ” 

“Later, we’ll talk. Probably have 
some marine command for you. Ex- 
perienced men are scarce. Hemp- 
hill, where are those groundcars?” 

The cold-eyed Earthinan turned 
to answer. Of course, his face had 
been familiar; this was Hemphill, 
fanatic hero of a dozen berserker 
fights. Mitch was faintly awed, in 
spite of himself. 

At last the groundcars came. The 
ride was into Ulan Bator. The mili- 
tary center would be under the 
metropolis, taking full advantage of 
the defensive forcefields that could 
be extended up into space to pro- 
tect the area of the city. 

Riding down the long elevator 
zig-zag to the buried War Room, 
Mitch found himself again next to 
Karlsen. 

“Congratulations on your coming 
marriage, sir.” Mitch didn’t know 
if he liked Karlsen or not; but al- 
ready he felt curiously certain of 
him, as if he had known the man 
for years. Karlsen would know he 
was not trying to curry favor. 

The High Commander nodded. 
“Thank you.” He hesitated for a 
moment, then produced a small pho- 
to. In an illusion of three dimen- 
sions it showed the head of a young 
woman, golden hair done in the 
style favored by the new aristocracy 
of Venus. 

There was no need for any polite 
stretching of truth. “She’s very 
beautiful.” 

“Yes.” Karlsen looked long at 



STONE PLACE

tiie picture, as if reluctant to put it 
away. “There are those who say 
this will be only a political alliance. 
God knows we need one. But be- 
lieve me, Poet, she means far more 
than that to me.” 

Karlsen blinked suddenly, and, as 
if amused at himself, gave Mitch 
a why-am-I-telling-you-all-this look. 
The elevator floor pressed up un- 
der the passengers’ feet, and the 
doors sighed open. They had reach- 
ed the catacomb of the General 
Staff. 

n 

M any of the Staff were Venetian 
in these days, though not an 
absolute majority. From their greet- 
ing, it was plain that the Venerian 
members were coldly hostile to No- 
gara’s brother. 

Humanity was, as always, a tangle 
of cliques and alliances. The brains 
of the Solarian Parliament and the 
Executive had been taxed to find 
a High Commander. If some ob- 
jected to Johann Karlsen, no one 
who knew him had any honest doubt 
of his ability. He brought with him 
to battle many trained men, and 
unlike some mightier leaders, he had 
been more than willing to take re- 
sponsibility for the defense of Sol. 

In the frigid atmosphere in which 
the Staff meeting opened, there was 
nothing but to get quickly to busi- 
ness. The enemy, the berserker ma- 
chines, had abandoned their old 
tactics of single, unpredictable 
raids. Those tactics had once threa- 
tened the intelligent life of this 
part of the galaxy with ruin, but 



slowly over the last decades the de- 
fenses of life had been strengthened, 
the scales had begun to tip. 

There were now thought to be 
about two hundred berserker ma- 
chines; they had recently formed 
themselves into a fleet, with con- 
centrated power capable of over- 
whelming one at a time all centers of 
human resistance. Two strongly de- 
fended planets had already been 
destroyed. A massed human fleet 
was needed, first to defend Sol, and 
then to meet and break the power of 
the unliving. 

“So far, then, we are agreed,” 
said Karlsen, straightening up from 
the plotting table and looking 
around at the General Staff. “We 
have not as many ships, or as many 
trained men as we would like. Per- 
haps no government away from Sol 
has contributed all it could.” 

Kemal, the Venerian Admiral, 
glanced around at his planetmen, but 
declined the chance to comment on 
the weak contribution of Karlsen's 
own half-brother, Nogara. There was 
no living being upon whom Earth, 
Mars, and Venus could agree, as 
the leader for this war. Kemal -seem- 
ed to be willing to try and live with 
Nogara’s brother. 

Karlsen went on: “We have 

available for combat two hundred 
and forty-three ships, specially con- 
structed or modified to suit the new 
tactics I propose to use. We are all 
grateful for the magnificent Venerian 
contribution of a hundred ships. Six 
of them, as you all probably know, 
mount the new long range, C-plus 
cannon.” 

The praise produced no visible 



12 



IP 




among the Venerians. Karl- 
ten went on. “We seem to have a 
numerical advantage of about forty 
ships. I needn’t tell you how the 
enemy outgun us and outpower us, 
unit for unit.” He paused. “The 
ram-and-board tactics should give 
us just the element of surprise we 
need.” 

P erhaps the High Commander was 
choosing his words carefully, not 
wanting to say that some element 
of surprise offered the only logical 
hope of success. After the decades- 
long dawning of hope, it would be 
too much to say that. Too much 
for even these tough-minded men 
who knew how a berserker machine 
weighed in the scales of war against 
any ordinary warship. 

“One big problem is trained 
men,” Karlsen continued, “to lead 
the boarding parties. I’ve done the 
best I can, recruiting. Of those ready 
and in training as boarding marines 
now, the bulk are Estellers.” 

Admiral Kemal seemed to guess 
what was coming; he started to push 
back his chair and rise, then waited, 
evidently wanting to make certain. 

Karlsen went on in the same 
level tone. “These trained marines 
will be formed into companies, and 
one company assigned to each war- 
ihip. Then — ” 

“One moment, High Commander 
Karlsen.” Kemal had risen. 

“Yes?” 

“Do I understand that you mean 
lo station companies of Esteelers 
■board Venerian ships?” 

“In many cases my plan will 
mean that, yes. You protest?” 



“I do.” The Venerian looked 
around at his planetmen. “We all 
do.” 

“Nevertheless it is so ordered.” 

Kemal looked briefly around at 
his fellows once more, then sat 
down, blank-faced. The steno- 
cameras in the room’s corners emit- 
ted their low sibilance, reminding 
all that their proceedings were be- 
ing recorded. 

A vertical crease appeared brief- 
ly in the High Commander’s fore- 
head, and he looked for long 
thoughtful seconds at the Venerians 
before resuming his talk. But what 
else was there to do, except put 
Esteelers onto Venerian ships? 

They won’t let you be a hero, 
Karlsen, thought Mitchell Spain. The 
universe is bad; and men are fools, 
never really all on the same side in 
any war. 

Ill 

I n the hold of the Venerian war- 
ship Solar Spot the armor lay 
packed inside a padded coffin-like 
crate. Mitch knelt beside it in- 
specting the knee and elbow joints. 

“Want me to paint some insignia 
on it, Captain?” 

It was a young Esteeler named 
Fishman, one of the newly formed 
marine company Mitch now com- 
manded. Fishman had picked up a 
multicolor paintstick somewhere, and 
he pointed with it to the suit. 

Mitch glanced around at the hold, 
swarming with his men busily open- 
ing crates of equipment. He had 
decided to let things run themselves 
as much as possible. 



STONE PLACE

“Insignia? Why, I don’t think so. 
Unless you have some idea for a 
company insignia. That might be a 
good thing to have.” 

There seemed no need for any 
distinguishing mark on his armored 
suit. It was of Martian make, dis- 
tinctive in style, old but with the 
latest improvements built in — prob- 
ably no man wore better. The barrel 
chest already bore one design — a 
large black spot shattered by jagged 
red — showing that Mitch had been 
In at the ‘death’ of one berserker. 
Mitch’s uncle had worn the same 
armor; the men of Mars had always 
gone in great numbers out to space. 

“Sergeant McKendrick,” Mitch 
asked, “what do you think about 
having a company insignia?” 

The newly appointed sergeant, an 
intelligent-looking young man, paus- 




ed in walking past, and looked from 
Mitch to Fishman as if trying to 
decide who stood where on insignia 
before committing himself. Then he 
looked between them, his expres- 
sion hardening. 

A thin-faced Venerian, evidently 
an officer, had entered the hold 
with a squad of six men behind him, 
armbanded and sidearmed. Ship’s 
Police. 

The officer took a few steps and 
then stood motionless, looking at the 
paintstick in Fishman’s hand. When 
everyone in the hold was silently 
watching him, he asked quiedy: 

“Why have you stolen from ship’s 
stores?” 

“Stolen — this!” The young Es- 
teller held up the paintstick, half 
smiling, as if ready to share a joke. 

They didn’t come joking with & 
Police squad, or, if they did, it was 
not the kind of joke a Martian ap- 
preciated. Mitch still knelt beside 
his crated armor. There was an un- 
loaded carbine inside the suit’s torso 
and he put his hand on it. 

“We are at war, and we are in 
space,” the thin-faced officer went 
on, still speaking mildly, standing 
relaxed, looking round at the open- 
mouthed Esteeler company. “Every- 
one aboard a Venerian ship is sub- 
ject to law. For stealing from ship’s 
stores, while we face the enemy, 
the penalty is death. Take him 
away.” He made an economical ges- 
ture to his squad. 

e paintstick clattered loudly on 
the deck. Fishman looked as if 
he might be going to topple over, 
half the smile still on his face.

IF 




Mitch stood up, the carbine in 
the crook of his arm. It was a stub- 
by weapon with heavy double bar- 
rels, really a miniature recoilless can- 
non, to be used in free fall to destroy 
armored machinery. '‘Just a min- 
ute, ” Mitch said. 

A couple of the police squad had 
begun to move uncertainly toward 
Fishman; they stopped in their 
tracks, as if glad of the chance. 

The officer looked at Mitch, and 
raised one cool eyebrow. “Do you 
know what the penalty is, for 
threatening me?” 

“Can’t be any worse than the 
penalty for blowing your ugly head 
off. I’m Captain Mitchell Spain, 
marine company commander on 
this ship, and nobody just comes 
in here and drags my men away and 
hangs them. Who are you?” 

“I am Mr. Salvador,” said the 
Venerian. His eyes appraised Mitch, 
no doubt establishing that he was 
Martian. Wheels were turning in 
Mr. Salvador’s calm brain, and plans 
were changing. He said: “Had I 
known that a man commanded this 
— group — I would not have 
thought an object lesson necessary. 
Come.” This last word was ad- 
dressed to his squad and accom- 
panied by another simple elegant 
gesture. The six almost rushed to 
precede him to the exit. Salvador’s 
eyes motioned Mitch to follow him 
toward the door. There he turned, 
still unruffled. 

“Your men will follow you eager- 
ly now, Captain Spain,” he said in a 
voice too low for anyone else to 
hear. “And the time will come when 
you will willingly follow me.” With 



a faint smile, as if of appreciation, 
he was gone. 

There was a moment of silence 
Mitch stared at the closed door, won- 
dering. Then a roar of jubilation 
burst out and his back was being 
pounded. 

“Captain — what’d he mean, catt- 
ing himself mister?” 

“It’s some kind of political rank 
the Venerians have. You guys look 
here! I may need some honest wit- 
nesses.” Mitch held up the carbine 
for all to see, and broke open t ha 
chambers and clips, showing it to 
be unloaded. There was renewed 
excitement, more howls and jokes 
at the expense of the retreated 
Venerians. 

But Salvador had not thought him- 
self defeated. 

“McKendrick, call the bridge. 
Tell the ship’s captain I want to see 
him. Let’s get on with this unpack- 
ing.” ' 

Young Fishman, paintstick to 
hand again, stood staring vacantly 
down as if contemplating a design 
for the deck. It was beginning to 
soak in, how close a thing it had 
been. 

But could the death-threat have 
been really serious? 

T he ship’s captain was coldly non- 
committal, but he indicated 
there were no present plans for 
hanging any Estellers on the Solar 
Spot. During the next sleep period 
Mitch kept armed sentries posted 
in the marines’ quarters. 

The next day he was summoned to 
the flagship. From the launch be 
had a view of a dance of bright 



STONE PLACE 



If 




dots, glinting in the light of dis- 
tant Sol. Part of the fleet was al- 
ready at ramming practice. 

Behind the High Commander’s 
desk sat neither a poetry critic nor 
a musing bridegroom, but the ruler 
of a planet. 

“Captain Spain — sit down.” 

To be given a chair seemed a 
good sign. Waiting for Karlsen to 
finish some paperwork, Mitch’s 
thoughts wandered, recalling cus- 
toms he had read about, ceremonies 
of saluting and posturing men had 
used in the past when huge perma- 
nent organizations had been formed 
for the sole purpose of killing other 
men and destroying their property. 
Certainly men were still as greedy 
as ever; and now the great con- 
flict with the unliving was forcing 
them to organize again for mass 
destruction. Could those old days, 
when life fought all-out war against 
life, ever come again? 

With a sigh, Karlsen pushed aside 
his papers. “What happened yester- 
day, between you and Mr. Salva- 
dor?” 

“He said he meant to hang one 
of my men.” Mitch gave the story, 
•s simply as he could. He omitted 
only Salvador’s parting words, with- 
out fully reasoning out why he did. 
“When I’m made responsible for 
men,” he finished, “nobody just 
walks in and hangs them. Though 
rm not fully convinced they would 
have gone that far, I meant to be as 
serious about it as they were.” 

The High Commander picked out 
a paper from his desk litter. “Two 
Esteeler marines have been hanged 
already. For fighting.” 



“Damned arrogant Venerians I’d 
say.” 

“I want none of that, CaptainP 
“Yes sir. But I’m telling you ws 
came mighty close to a shooting 
war, yesterday on the Solar Spot" 
“I realize that” Karlsen made a 
gesture expressive of futility. “Spain, 
is it impossible for the people of 
this fleet to cooperate, even when 
the survival — what is it?” 

T he Earthman, Hemphill, had 
entered the cabin without cere- 
mony. His thin lips were pressed 
tighter than ever. “A courier has just 
arrived with news. Atsog is attack- 
ed.” 

Karlsen’s strong hand crumpled 
papers with an involuntary twitch. 
“Any details?” 

“The courier captain says he 
thinks the whole berserker fleet was 
there. The ground defenses were still 
resisting strongly when he pulled 
out. He just got his ship away in 
time.” 

Atsog; a planet closer to Sol 
than the enemy had been thought 
to be. It was Sol they were coming 
for, all right. They must know it 
was the human center. 

More people were at the oabin 
door. Hemphill stepped aside for the 
Venerian, Admiral Kemal. Mr. 
Salvador, hardly glancing at Mitch 
followed the admiral in. 

“You have heard the news. 
High Commander?” Salvador began. 
Kemal, just ready to speak himself, 
gave his political officer an annoyed 
glance, but said nothing. 

“That Atsog is attacked, yes,” 
said Karlsen. 



16 



IF 




"My ships can be ready to move 
In two hours,” said Kemal. 

Karlsen sighed, and shook his 
head. “I watched today’s maneuvers. 
The fleet can hardly be ready in 
two weeks.” 

Kemal’s shock and rage seemed 
genuine. “You’d do that? You’d let 
a Venerian planet die just because 
we haven’t knuckled under to your 
brother? Because we discipline his 
damned Esteeler — ” 

“Admiral Kemal, you will control 
yourself! You, and everyone else, 
are subject to discipline, while I 
command!” 

Kemal got himself in hand, ap- 
parently with great effort. 

Karlsen’s voice was not very loud, 
but the cabin seemed to resonate 
with it. 

“You call hangings part of your 
discipline. I swear by the name of 
God that I will use even hanging, 
if I must, to enforce some kind of 
unity in this fleet. Understand, this 
fleet is the only military power 
that can oppose the massed ber- 
serkers. Trained, and unified, we 
can destroy them.” 

No listener could doubt it for the 
moment. 

“But .whether Atsog falls, or 
Venus, or Esteel, I will not risk this 
fleet until I judge it ready.” 

Into the silence, Salvador said, 
with an air of respect: “High Com- 
mander, the courier reported one 
thing more. That the Lady Christina 
de Dulcin was visiting on Atsog 
when the attack began — and that 
she must be there still.” 

Karlsen closed his eyes for two 
seconds. Then he looked round at 

STONE PLACE 



all of them. “If you have no fur- 
ther military business, gentlemen, get 
out.” His voice was still steady. 

Walking beside Mitch down the 
flagship corridor, Hemphill broke 
a silence to say thoughtfully: “Karl- 
sen is the man the cause needs, now. 
Some Venerians have approached 
me, tentatively, about joining a plot 
— I refused. We must make sure 
that Karlsen remains in command.” 

“A plot?” 

Hemphill did not elaborate. 

Mitch said: “What they did just 
now was pretty low — letting him 
make that speech about going slow, 
no matter what — and then break- 
ing the news to him about his lady 
being on Atsog.” 

Hemphill said : “He knew al- 

ready she was there. That news ar- 
rived on yesterday’s courier.” 




IV 

T here was a dark nebula made 
up of clustered billions of 
rocks and older than the sun, named 
the Stone Place by men. Those who 
gathered there now were not men 
and they gave nothing a name; they 
hoped nothing, feared nothing, won- 
dered at nothing. They had no 
pride and no regret, but they had 
plans — a billion subtleties, carved 
from electrical pressure and flow — 
and their built-in purpose, toward 
which their planning circuits moved. 
As if by instinct the berserker ma- 
chines had formed themselves into 
a fleet when the time was ripe, when 
the eternal enemy, Life, had begun 
to mass its strength. 

The planet named Atsog in the 
life-language had yielded a number 
of still functioning life-units from 
its deepest shelters, though millions 
had been destroyed while their stub- 
born defenses were beaten down. 
Functional life-units were sources 
of valuable information — long ago 
the berserkers had learned human 
languages, and something of human 
psychology. There were stimuli, even 
the threat of which usually brought 
at least limited cooperation from 
any life-unit. 

The life-unit (designating itself 
General Bradin) which had controll- 
ed the defense of Atsog, was among 
those captured, almost undamaged. 
Its dissection was begun within 
perception of the other captured 
life-units. The thin outer covering 
tissue was delicately removed, and 
placed upon a suitable form, to 
preserve it for further study. The 



life-units which controlled othen 
were examined carefully, whenever 
possible. 

After this stimulus, it was no 
longer possible to communicate in- 
telligibly with General Bradin; in 
a matter of hours it ceased to func- 
tion at all. 

In itself a trifling victory, this 
small unit of watery matter was 
freed of the aberration called Life. 
But the flow of information now 
increased from the nearby units 
which had perceived the process. 

It was soon confirmed that the 
Life-units were assembling a fleet 
More detailed information was 
sought. One important line of ques- 
tioning concerned the life-unit which 
would control this fleet Gradually, 
from interrogations and the reading 
of captured records, a picture em- 
erged. 

A name: Johann Karlsen. A bio- 
graphy. Contradictory things were 
said about him, but die facts show- 
ed he had risen rapidly to a position 
of control over millions of life- 
units. 

Throughout the long war, the ber- 
serker computers had gathered and 
collated all available data on the 
men who became leaders of Life. 
Now against this data they matched, 
point for point, every detail that 
could be learned about Johann Karl- 
sen. 

The behavior of these leading units 
often resisted analysis, as if some 
quality of the life-disease in them 
was forever beyond the reach of 
machines. These individuals used 
logic, but sometimes it seemed they 
were not bound by logic. The most 



18 



IF 




dangerous life-units of all some- 
times acted in ways that seemed 
to contradict the known supremacy 
of the laws of physics and of chance, 
as if they could be minds possessed 
of true free will, instead of its illu- 
sion. 

And Karlsen was one of these, 
supremely one of these. His fitting 
of the dangerous pattern became 
plainer with every new comparison. 

In the past, such life-units had 
been troublesome local problems. 
For one of them to command the 
whole life-fleet with a decisive bat- 
tle approaching, was extremely 
dangerous to the cause of Death. 

The outcome of the approaching 
battle seemed almost certain to be 
favorable, since there were probably 
only two hundred ships in the life- 
fleet. But die brooding berserkers 
could not be certain enough of any- 
thing, white a unit like Johann Karl- 
sen led the Irving. And if the battle 
was long postponed the enemy Life 
could become stronger. There were 
hints that inventive Life was de- 
veloping new weapons, newer and 
more powerful ships. 

The wordless conference reached 
a decision. There were berserker re- 
serves, which had waited for mil- 
lenaa along the galactic rim, dead 
and uncaring in their hiding places 
among dust clouds and heavy nebu- 
lae, and on dark stars. For this 
climactic battle they must be sum- 
moned, the power of Life to resist 
must be broken now. 

From the berserker fleet at the 
Stone Place, between Atsog’s Sun 
and Sol, courier machines sped out 
toward the galactic rim. 



It would take some time for all 
the reserves to gather. Meanwhile, 
the interrogations went on. 

iiT isten, I’ve decided I can help 
JL' you, see. About this guy 
Karlsen, I know you want to find 
out about him. Only I got a delicate 
brain. If anything hurts me my brain 
don’t work at all, so no rough stuff 
on me, understand? I’M be no good 
to you ever if you use rough stuff 
on me.” 

This prisoner was unusual. The 
interrogating computer borrowed 
new circuits for itself, chose , sym- 
bols and hurled them back at the 
life-unit. 

“What can you tell me about 
Karlsen?” 

“Listen, you’re gonna treat me 
right, aren’t you?” 

“Useful information will be re- 
warded. Untruth will bring you un- 
pleasant stimuli.” 

“I’ll tell you this now — the 
woman Karfsen was going to marry 
is here, you caught her alive in the 
same shelter Bradin was in.” Tr.v.v. 
“Now if you sort of give me con- 
trol over all these other prisoners 
make things nice for me, why I 
bet I can think up the best way for 
you to use her. If you just tell him 
you’ve got her, why he might not 
believe you, see?” 

Out on the galactic rim, the signals 
of the heralds called out the hid- 
den reserves of the unliving. Subtle 
detectors heard the signals, and trig- 
gered the great engines into cold 
flame. The forcefield brain in each 
strategic housing awoke to livelier 
death. Each reserve machine ac-

knowledged the call and began to 
move with metallic leisure, shaking 
loose its cubic miles of weight and 
power, freeing itself from dust, or 
ice, or age-old mud, or solid rock 
— then rising and turning, orienting 
itself in space. All converging, they 
drove faster than light toward the 
Stone Place, where the destroyers of 
Atsog awaited their reinforcement. 

With the arrival of each reserve 
machine, the linked berserker com- 
puters saw victory more probable. 
But still the quality of one life-unit 
made all computations uncertain.

F elipe Nogara raised a strong and 
hairy hand, and wiped it gently 
across one glowing segment of the 
panel before his chair. The center 
of his private study was filled by an 
enormous display sphere, which now 
showed a representation of the ex- 
plored part of the galaxy. At No- 
gara’s gesture, the sphere dimmed 
and began to relight itself in a slow 
intricate sequence. 

A wave of his hand had just 
theoretically eliminated the berserk- 
er fleet as a factor in the power 
game. To leave it in, he told him- 
aelf, diffused the probabilities too 
widely. It was really the competing 
power of Ventrs — and that of two 
or three other prosperous, agressive 
planets — which occupied his mind. 

Well insulated in this private room 
from the hum of Esteel City and 
from the routine press of business, 
Nogara watched his computers’ new 
prediction take shape, showing the 
political power structure as it might 



exist one year from now, two year* 
five. As he had expected, this m* 
quence showed Esteel expanding hi 
influence. It was even possible that 
he could become ruler of the hu- 
man galaxy. 

Nogara wondered at his own calm 
in the face of such an idea. Twelve 
or fifteen years ago he had driven 
with all his power of intellect and 
will to advance himself. Gradually, 
the moves in the game had come to 
seem automatic. Today, there was a 
chance that almost every thinking 
being known to exist would come 
to acknowledge him as ruler — and 
it meant less to him than the first 
local election he had ever won. 

Diminishing returns, of course. 
The more gained, the greater gain 
needed to produce an equal pleasure. 
At least when he was alone. If his 
aides were watching this prediction 
now it would certainly excite them, 
and he would catch their excite- 
ment. 

But, being alone, he sighed. The 
berserker fleet would not vanish at 
the wave of a hand. Today, what 
was probably the final plea for more 
help had arrived from Earth. The 
trouble was that granting Sol more 
help would take ships and men and 
money from Nogara’s expansion pro- 
jects. Wherever he did that now he 
stood to lose out, eventually, to 
other men. Old Sol would have to 
survive the coming attack with no 
more help from Esteel. 

Nogara realized, wondering dully 
at himself, that he would as soon 
see even Esteel destroyed as see 
control slip from his hands. Now 
why? He could not say he loved his

IF 




planet or people, but he had been, 
by and large, a good ruler, not a ty- 
rant. Good government was, after 
all, good politics. 

His desk chimed the melodious 
notes that meant something was new- 
ly available for his amusement No- 
gara chose to answer. 

4 COir,” said a woman’s voice, “two 

O new possibilities are in the 
ahower room now.” 

Projected from hidden cameras, 
a scene glowed into life above No- 
gara’s desk; bodies gleaming in a 
•pray of water. 

“They are from prison, sir, anxi- 
ous for any reprieve.” 

Watching, Nogara felt only a 
weariness; and, yes, something like 
self-contempt. He questioned him- 
self: Where in all the universe is 
there a reason why I should not 
seek pleasure as I choose? And 
again: Will I dabble in sadism, next? 
And if I do, what of it? 

But what after that? 

Having paused respectfully, the 
voice asked: “Perhaps this evening 
you would prefer something differ- 
ent?” 

“Later,” he said. The scene van- 
ished. Maybe I should try to be a 
Believer for a while, he thought. 
What an intense thrill it must be 
for Johann to sin. If he ever does. 

That had been a genuine pleasure, 
seeing Johann given command of 
the Solarian Fleet, watching the 
Venerians boil. But it had raised 
another problem. Johann, victorious 
over the berserkers would emerge as 
the greatest hero in human history. 
Would that not make even Johann 



STONE PLACE 




dangerously ambitious? The thing to 
do would be to ease him out of the 
public eye, give him some high- 
ranked job, honest, but dirty and in- 
gforious. Hunting out outlaws some- 
where, Johann would probably ac- 
cept that, being Johann. But if 
Johann bid for galactic power, he 
wo ul d have to take his chances. Any 
pawn in the game might be re- 
moved. 

Nogara shook his head. Suppose 
Johann lost the coming battle, and 
lost Sol? A berserker victory would 
not be a matter of diffusing prob- 
abilities, that was pleasant double 
talk for a tired mind to fool itself 
with. A berserker victory would 
mean the end of Earth man in the 
galaxy, probably within a few years. 
No computer was needed to see 
that 

There was a little bottle in his 
desk; Nogara brought it out and 
looked at it The end of the chess 
game was in It The end of all 
pleasure and boredom and pain. 
Looking at the vfad caused him no 
emotion. In H was a powerful drug 
which threw a man into a kind of 
ecstasy — a transcendental excite- 
ment that within a few minutes 
burst the heart or the blood vessels 
of the brain. Someday, when all 
else was exhausted, when it was 
completely a berserker universe — 

He put the vial away and he put 
away die final appeal from Earth. 
What did it all matte*? Was it not a 
berserker unxvene already, every- 
thing determined by the random 
swirls of condensing gas, before the 
stars were born? 

Felipe Nogara leaned back in Ids 



chair, watching his computers mark- 
ing out the galactic chessboard. 

VI 

T hrough the fleet the rumor 
spread that Karlsen delayed 
because it was a Venerian colony 
under seige. Aboard the Solar Spot , 
Mitch saw no delays for any rea- 
son. He had time for only work, 
quick meals and sleep. When the 
final ram-and-board drill had been 
completed, the last stores and am- 
munition loaded, Mitch was too 
tired to feel much except relief. He 
rested, not frightened or elated, 
while the Spot wheeled into a rank 
with forty other arrow-shaped ships, 
dipped with them into the first C- 
plus jump of the deep space search, 
and began to hunt the enemy. 

It was days later before dull rou- 
tine was broken by a jangling battle 
alarm. Mitch was wakened by it; 
before his eyes were fully opened, 
he was scrambling into the armored 
suit stored under his bunk. Nearby, 
some marines grumbled about prac- 
tice alerts; but none of them was 
moving slowly. 

“This is High Commander Karl- 
sen speaking,” boomed the over- 
head speakers. “This is not a prac- 
tice alert, repeat, not practice. Two 
berserkers have been sighted. One 
we’ve just glimpsed at extreme 
range. Likely it will get away, though 
the Ninth Squadron is chasing if. 

“The other is not going to es- 
cape. In a matter of minutes we will 
have it englobed, in normal space. 
We are not going to destroy it by 
bombardment; we are going to 



It 







soften it up a bit, and then see 
how well we can really ram-and- 
board. If there are any bugs left in 
our tactics, we’d better find out 
now. Squadrons Two, Four, and 
Seven will each send one ship to the 
ramming attack. I’m going back on 
Command Channel now, Squadron 
Commanders.” 

“Squadron Four,” sighed Serge- 
ant McKendrick. “More Esteelers 
in our company than any other. 
How can we miss?” 

The marines lay like dragon’s 
teeth seeded in the dark, strapped 
into the padded acceleration couches 
that had been their bunks, while 
the psych-music tried to hill them, 
and those who were Believers pray- 
ed. In the darkness Mitch listened, 
and passed on to his men the terse 
battle reports that came to him as 
marine commander on the ship. 

He was afraid. What was death, 
that men should fear it so? It could 
be only the end of all experience. 
That was inevitable, and beyond 
imagination, and he feared it. 

The preliminary bombardment did 
not take long. Two hundred and 
thirty ships of life held a single 
great trapped enemy in the center 
of their hollow sphere formation. 
The enemy did not give a damn if 
he was trapped because he was 
dead already and had always been 
dead. 

Listening in the dark to laconic 
voices, Mitch heard how the great 
berserker fought back, as if with 
the finest human courage and con- 
tempt for odds. Could you really 
fight machines when you could never 
make them suffer pain or fear? 



B ut you could defeat machine*. 

And this time, for once, hu- 
manity had far too many guns. It 
would be easy to blow this berserker 
into vapor. Would it be best to do 
so? There were bound to be marine 
casualties m any boarding no mat- 
ter how favorable the odds. But a 
true combat test of the- boarding 
scheme was badly needed before the 
decisive battle came to be fought. 
And, too, this enemy might hold 
living prisoners who might be res- 
cued by boarders. A High Comman- 
der probably did well to have a 
rocklike certainty of his own right- 
ness. 

The order was given. The Spot 
and two other chosen ships fell in 
toward the battered enemy at the 
center of the englobement 
Straps held Mitch firmly, but the 
gravity had been turned off for the 
ramming, and weightlessness gave 
the impression that his body would 
fly and vibrate like a pellet shaken 
in a bottle with the coming impact. 
Soundless dark, soft cushioning, and 
lulling music; but a few words came 
into the helmet and the body cringed, 
knowing that outside were the black 
cold guns and the hurtling machines, 
unimaginable forces leaping now to 
meet. Now — 

Reality shattered in through all 
the protection and padding. The 
shaped atomic charge at the tip of 
the ramming prow opened the ber- 
serker’s skin. In five seconds of 
crashing impact, the prow vaporized, 
melted, and crumpled its length 
away, the true hull driving behind it 
until the Solar Spot was sunk like an 
arrow into the body of her enemy. 



STONE PLACE

Mitch spoke for the last time to 
the bridge of the Solar Spot, while 
his men lurched past him in free 
fall, their suit lights glaring. 

“My panel shows Sally Port Three 
the only one not blocked,” he said. 
“We’re all going out that way.” 
“Remember,” said a Venerian 
voice, “your first job is to protect 
this ship against counterattack.” 
“Roger.” If they wanted to give 
him offensively unnecessary remin- 
ders, now was not the time for argu- 
ment. He broke contact with the 
bridge and hurried after his men. 

The other two ships were to send 
their boarders fighting toward the 
strategic housing, which would be 
somewhere deep in the berserker’s 
center. The marines from the Solar 
Spot were to try to find and save 
any prisoners the berserker might 
hold. A berserker usually held 
prisoners near its surface, so the 
first search would be made by 
squads spreading out under the hun- 
dreds of square kilometers of hull. 

In the dark chaos of wrecked ma- 
chinery just outside the sally port 
there was no sign yet of coun- 
terattack. The berserkers’ unknown 
builders supposedly had not con- 
structed them to fight battles inside 
their own metallic skins, upon which 
fact rode the fleet’s hopes for suc- 
cess in a major battle. 

Mitch left forty men to defend 
the hull of the Spot, and himself 
led a squad of ten out into the 
labyrinth. There was no use setting 
himself up in a command post — 
communications in here would be 
impossible, once out of line-of- 
sight. 



T he first man in each searching 
squad carried a mass spectro- 
meter, an instrument that would 
detect the stray atoms of oxygen 
bound to leak from compartments 
where living beings breathed. The 
last man wore on one hand a device 
to blaze a trail with arrows of 
luminous paint; without a trail, get- 
ting lost in this three-dimensional 
maze would be almost inevitable. 

“Got a scent, Captain,” said 
Mitch’s spectrometer man, after five 
minutes’ casting through the squad’s 
assigned sector of the dying ber- 
serker. 

“Keep on it.” Mitch was second 
in line, his carbine ready. 

The detector man led the way 
through a' dark and weightless 
mechanical universe, perhaps last 
seen by living eyes fifty-thousand 
years before. Several times he 
paused, adjusting his instrument and 
waving its probe. The pace was 
rapid; men trained in free fall, given 
plenty of holds to thrust and steer 
by could move faster than runners. 

A towering, multi-jointed shape 
rose up before the detector man, 
brandishing blue-white welding arcs 
like swords. 

Before Mitch was aware of aim- 
ing his carbine fired twice. The 
shells ripped the machine open and 
pounded it backward; it was only 
some semi-robotic maintenance de- 
vice, not built for fighting. 

The detector man had nerve; he 
plunged right on. The squad kept 
pace with him, their suit lights scout- 
ing out unfamiliar shapes and dis- 
tances, cutting knife-edge shadows 
m the vacuum, glare and darkness

mellowed only by reflection. 

“Getting close!” 

And then they came to it. It was 
a place like the top of a huge dry 
well. An ovoid like a ship’s launch, 
very thickly armored, had apparent- 
ly been raised through the well 
from deep inside the berserker, and 
was now clamped to a dock. 

“It’s the launch, it’s oozing 
oxygen.” 

“Captain, there’s some kind of 
airlock on this side. Outer door’s 
open.” 

It looked like the smooth and 
easy entrance of a trap. 

“Keep your eyes open.” Mitch 
went into the airlock. “Be ready to 
blast me out of here if I don’t 
show in one minute.” 

It was an ordinary airlock, prob- 
ably cut from some human space- 
ship. He shut himself inside, and 
then got the inner door open. 

Most of the interior was a single 
compartment. In the center was an 
acceleration couch, holding a nude 
female mannikin. He drifted near, 
saw that her head had been de- 
pilated and that there were tiny 
beads of blood still on her scalp, 
as if probes had just been with- 
drawn. 

When his suit lamp hit her face 
she opened dead blue staring eyes, 
blinking mechanically. Still not sure 
that he was looking at a living hu- 
man being, Mitch drifted beside her 
and touched her arm with metal 
fingers. Then ail at once her face 
became human, her eyes coming 
from death through nightmare to 
reality. She saw him and cried out. 
Before he could free her there were 



crystal drops of tears in the weight- 
less air. 

Listening to his rapid orders, she 
held one hand modestly in front of 
her, and the other over her raw 
scalp. Then she nodded, and took 
into her mouth the end of a breath- 
ing tube which would dole air from 
Mitch’s suit tank. In a few more 
seconds he had her wrapped in a 
clinging, binding rescue blanket, 
temporary proof against vacuum and 
freezing. 

The detector man had found 
no other oxygen source near the 
launch. Mitch ordered his squad 
back along their luminous trail. 

A t the sally port, he heard that 
things were not going well with 
the attack. Real fighting robots were 
defending the strategic housing, 
where its forcefield brain was buried, 
miles inside it. At least eight men 
had been killed down there. Two 
more ships were going to ram and 
board. 

Mitch carried the girl through the 
sally port and three more friendly 
hatches. The monstrously thick hull 
of the ship shuddered and sang 
around him; the Solar Spot, her 
mission accomplished, boarders re- 
trieved, was being withdrawn. Fufl 
weight came back, and light. 

“In here, Captain.” 
QUARANTINE, said the sign. A 
berserker’s prisoner might have 
been deliberately infected with some- 
thing contagious. Men knew how to 
deal with such tricks; the machines 
had tried them before. 

Inside the infirmary, he set her 
down. While medics and nurses 



STONE PLACE

scrambled around, lie unfolded the 
blanket from tl le girl 4 * face, re- 
membering to leave h curled over 
her shaven head, and opened his 
own helmet. 

“You can spit out the tube, now,” 
he told her, in his rasping voice. 

She did so and opened her eyes 
again. 

“Oh, are you real?” she whispered. 
Her hand pushed its way out of the 
blanket folds and slid over his 
armor. “Oh, let me touch a human 
being again!” Her hand moved up 
to his exposed face and gripped his 
cheek and neck. 

“I’m real enough. You’re all right, 
now.” 

‘ One of the bustling doctors came 
to a sudden, frozen halt, staring 
at the girl. Then he spun around 
on his heel and hurried away. What 
was wrong? 

Others sounded confident, reas- 
suring the girl as they ministered 
to her. She wouldn’t let go of Mitch, 
die became nearly hysterical when 
tiey tried gently to separate her 
from him. 

“I guess you’d better stay,” a 
doctor told him. 

He sat there holding her hand, 
his helmet and gauntlets off. He 
looked away while they did medi- 
cal things to her. They still spoke 
reassuringly; he thought they were 
finding nothing much wrong. 

“What’s your name?” she asked 
him when the medics were through 
for the moment. Her head was 
bandaged; her slender arm came 
from between sheets to maintain 
contact with his hand. 

“Mitchell Spain.” Now that he 



got a good look at her, a living 
young human female, he was in no 
hurry at all to get away. “What’s 
yours?” 

A shadow crossed her face. “I’m 
— not sure.” 

There was a sudden commotion 
at the infirmary door; High Com- 
mander Karlsen was pushing past 
protesting doctors into the QUAR- 
ANTINE area. Karlsen came on un- 
til he was standing beside Mitch, but 
he was not looking at Mitch. 

“Chris,” he said to the girl. 
“Thank God.” There were tears in 
his eyes. 

The Lady Christina de Dulcin 
turned her eyes from Mitch to 
Johann Karlsen, and screamed in 
abject terror 

VU 

C4XJ°w, Captain, tell me how you 

1 v found her and brought her 
out.” 

Mitch began his tale. Hie two 
men were alone in Karlsen’s monas- 
tic cabin, just off the flagship’s 
bridge. The fight was over, the ber- 
serker a torn and harmless hulk. No 
other prisoners had been aboard it. 

“They planned to send her back 
to me,” Karlsen said staring into 
space, when Mitch had finished 
his account. “We attacked before it 
could launch her toward us. It kept 
her safe, and sent her back to 
me.” 

Mitch was silent. 

Karlsen’s red-rimmed eyes fasten- 
ed on him. “She’s been brainwashed, 
Poet. It can be done with some 
permanence, you know, when ad-

vantage is taken of the subject’s 
natural tendencies. I suppose she’s 
never thought too much of me. 
There were political reasons for her 
to consent to our marriage . she 
screams when the doctors even men- 
tion my name. They tell me it’s 
possible that horrible things were 
done to her by some man-shaped 
machine made to look like me. 
Other people are tolerable, to a de- 
gree. But it’s you she wants to be 
alone with, you she needs.” 

“She cried out when I left her, 
but — me?” 

“The natural tendency, you see. 
For her to — love — the man who 
aaved her. The machines set her 
mind to fasten all the joy of rescue 
upon the first male human face she 
saw. The doctors assure me such 
things can be done. They’ve given 
her drugs, but even in sleep the in- 
struments show her nightmares, her 
pain, and she cries out for you. 
What do you feel toward her?” 
“Sir, I’ll do anything I can. What 
do you want of me?” 

“I want you to stop her suffering, 
what else?” Karlsen's voice rose to a 
nagged shout. “Stay alone with her, 
stop her pain if you can!” 

He got himself under a kind of 
control. “Go on. The doctors will 
take’ you in. Your gear will be 
brought over from the Solar Spot ” 
Mitch stood up. Any words he 
could think of sounded in his mind 
like sickening attempts at humor. 
He nodded, and hurried out. 

44Hphis is your last chance to join 
A us,” said the Venerian, Sal- 
vador, looking up and down the dim 



corridors of this remote outer part 
of the flagship. “Our patience is 
worn, and we will strike soon. With 
the de Dulcin woman in her present 
condition, Nogara’s brother is doub- 
ly unfit to command.” 

The Venerian must be carrying a 
pocket spy-jammer; a multisonic 
whine was setting Hemphill’s teeth 
on edge. And so was the Venerian. 

“Karlsen is vital to the human 
cause whether we like him or not,” 
Hemphill said, his own patience 
about gone, but his voice calm and 
reasonable. “Don’t you see to what 
lengths the berserkers have gone, to 
get at him? They sacrificed a per- 
fectly good machine just to deliver 
his brainwashed woman here, to at- 
tack him psychologically.” 

“Well. If that is true they have 
succeeded. If Karlsen had any value 
before, now he will be able to think 
of nothing but his woman and the A 
Martian.” 

Hemphill sighed. “Remember, he 
refused to hurry the fleet to Atsog 
to try to save her. He hasn't failed 
yet. Until he does, you and the 
others must give up this plotting 
against him.” 

Salvador backed away a step, and 
spat on the deck in rage. A calcu- 
lated display, thought Hemphill. 

“Look to yourself, Earth man!” 
Salvador hissed. “Karlsen’s days are 
numbered, and the days of those who 
support him too willingly!” He spun 
around and walked away. 

“Wait!” Hemphill called, quietly. 
The Venerian stopped and turned 
with an air of arrogant reluctance. 
Hemphill shot him through the heart 
with a laser pistol. The weapon 



STONE PLACE

made a splitting, crackling noise in 
atmosphere. 



“You were good at talking and 
scheming,” Hemphill mused aloud, 
prodding the dying man with his toe, 
making sure no second shot was 
needed. “But too devious, to lead the 
figjht against the damned machines.” 

He bent quickly to search the 
body, and stood up elated. He had 
found a list of officers’ names, some 
few underlined, some, including his 
own, followed by an interrogation 
point. Another document was a 
scribbled compilation of the units un- 
der command of certain Venerian 
officers. There were a few more 
notes; altogether, plenty of evidence 
for the arrest of the hard-core plot- 
ters. It might tend to split the fleet, 
but — 

Hemphill looked up sharply, then 



relaxed. The man approaching w as 
one of his own, whom he had sta- 
tioned nearby. 

“We’ll take these to the Hi^h 
Commander at once.” Hemphill 
waved the papers. “There’ll be just 
time to clean out the traitors and 
reorganize command before we face 
battle.” 

Yet he delayed for another mo- 
ment, staring down at Salvador's 
corpse. The plotter had been over- 
confident and inept, but still dan- 
gerous. Did some sort of luck op- 
erate to protect Karlsen? Karlseo 
himself did not match Hemphill’s 
ideal of a war leader, he was not as 
ruthless as machinery or as cold as 
metal. Yet the damned machines 
made great sacrifices to attack him. 

Hemphill shrugged, and hurried 
on his way. 

Uli >Titch, I do love you. I know 
IV JL what the doctors say it is, 
but what do they really know about 
me?” 

Christina de Dulcin reclined up- 
on a luxurious acceleration couch, 
in what was nominally the sleeping 
room of the High Commander's 
quarters. Karlsen had never occupied 
the place, preferring a small cabin. 

Mitchell Spain sat three feet from 
Chris, afraid to so much as touch 
her hand, afraid of what he might 
do, and what she might do. They 
were alone, and he felt sure they 
were unwatched. Chris had even de- 
manded assurances against spy de- 
vices and Karlsen had sent his 
pledge. Besides, what kind of ship 
would have spy devices built into 
its highest officer’s quarters? 



28 



IF 



A situation for bedroom farce, 
but not when you had to live 
through it. The man outside* taking 
the strain, had two hundred ships 
dependent on him now, and many 
human planets would be lifeless in 
five years if the coming battle failed. 

“What do you really know about 
me, Chris?” he asked. 

“I know you mean life itself to 
me. Oh, Mitch, I have no time now 
to be coy, and mannered, and every 
millimeter a lady. I’ve been all 
those things. And — once — I 
would have married a man like Karl- 
een, for political reasons. But all 
that was before Atsog.” 

Her voice dropped on the last 
word, and her hand on her robe 
made a convulsive grasping gesture. 
He had to lean forward and take it. 

“Chris, Atsog is in the past, now.” 

“Atsog will never be over, com- 
pletely over, for me. I keep re- 
membering more and more of it. 
Mitch, the machines made us watch 
while they skinned General Bradin 
alive. I saw that. I can’t bother 
with silly things like politics any- 
more, life is too short for them. I 
don’t fear anything anymore, either, 
except driving you away . 

He felt pity and lust, and half a 
dozen other maddening things. 

“Karlsen’s a good man,” he said 
finally. 

She repressed a shudder. “I sup- 
pose,” she said, in a controlled 
voice. “But Mitch, what do you 
feel for me? Tell the truth — if 
you don’t love me now, I know 
you will, in time.” She smiled faint- 
ly, and raised a hand. “When my 
silly hair grows back.” 



“Your silly hair.” His voice al- 
most broke. He reached to touch 
her face, then pulled his fingers 
back as if from a flame. “Chris, 
you’re his girl, and too much de- 
pends on him.” 

“I was never his.” 

“Still ... I can’t lie to you, 
Chris; maybe I can’t tell you the 
truth, either, about how I feel. 
The battle’s coming, everything’s up 
in the air, paralyzed. No one can 
plan ...” He made an awkward, 
uncertain gesture. 

“Mitch.” Her voice was under- 
standing. “This is terrible for you, 
isn’t it? Don’t worry, I’ll do nothing 
to make it worse. Will you call the 
doctor? As long as I know you’re 
somewhere near, I think I can rest, 
now.” 

vra 

K arisen studied Salvador’s papers 
in silence for some minutes, 
like a man pondering a chess prob- 
lem. He did not seem greatly sur- 
prised. 

“I have a few dependable men 
standing ready,” Hemphill finally 
volunteered. “We can quickly — 
arrest — the leaders of this plot.” 
The blue eyes searched him. 
“Commander, was Salvador’s killing 
truly necessary?” 

“I thought so,” said Hemphill 
blandly. “He was reaching for his 
own weapon.” 

Karlsen glanced once more at the 
papers and reached a decision. 

“Commander Hemphill, I want 
you to pick four ships, and scout 
the far edge of the Stone Place 



STONE PLACE

nebula. We don’t want to push be- 
yond it, without knowing where the 
enemy is, and give him a chance to 
get between us and Sol. Use cau- 
tion — to get the general location 
jjpf the bulk of his fleet is enough.” 
| “Very well.” Hemphill nodded. 
*The reconnaissance made sense; 
and if Karlsen wanted to get Hemp- 
hill out of the way, and deal with 
his human opponents by his own 
methods, well, let him. Those 
methods often seemed soft-headed to 
Hemphill, but they seemed to work 
for Karlsen. If the damned ma- 
chines for some reason found Karl- 
sen unendurable, then Hemphill 
would support him, to the point of 
cheerful murder and beyond. 

What else really mattered in the 
universe, besides smashing the damn- 
ed machines? 

Mitch spent hours every day alone 
with Chris. He kept from her the 
wild rumors which circulated 
throughout the fleet. Salvador’s 
violent end was whispered about, 
and guards were posted near Karl- 
sen ’s quarters. Some said Admiral 
Kemal was on the verge of open 
revolt. 

And now the Stone Place was 
close ahead of the fleet; ebony 
dust and fragments, like a million 
shattered planets, blotting out half 
the sky. No ship oould move 
through the Stone Place; every cu- 
bic kilometer of it held enough mat- 
ter to prevent C-plus travel or 
normal movement. 

The fleet headed toward one 
sharply defined edge, around which 
Hemphill’s scouting squadron had 
already disappeared. 



4 4 Che grows a little saner, a little 
O calmer, every day,” said 
Mitch, entering the High Comman- 
der's monastic cabin. 

Karlsen looked up from his desk. 
The papers before him looked like 
lists of names, in Venerian script. 
“I thank you for that word. Poet 
Does she speak of me?” 

“No.” 

They eyed each other, the poor 
and ugly cynic, the anointed and 
handsome Believer. 

“Poet,” Karlsen asked suddenly, 
“how do you deal with deadly ene- 
mies, when you find them in your 
power?” 

“We Martians are supposed to be 
a violent people. Do you expect me 
to pass sentence on myself?” 

Karlsen appeared not to under- 
stand, for a moment. “Oh. No. I 
was not speaking of — you and I, 
and Chris. Not of personal affairs. 
I suppose I was only thinking aloud, 
asking for a sign.” 

“Then don’t ask me, ask your 
God. But didn’t he tell you to for- 
give your enemies?” 

“He did.” Karlsen nodded, slow- 
ly and thoughtfully. “You know, He 
wants a lot from us. A real hell of 
a lot.” 

It was a peculiar sensation, to be- 
come suddenly convinced that the 
man you were watching was a genu- 
ine, non-hypocritical Believer. Mitch 
was not sure he had ever met the 
like before. 

Nor had he ever seen Karlsen 
quite like this — passive, waiting, 
asking for a sign. As if there was 
in fact some Purpose outside the 
layers of a man’s own mind, that 



30 



IF 




could inspire him. Mitch thought 
about it. If . 

But that was all mystical non- 
sense. 

Karlsen’s communicator sounded. 
Mitch could not make out what the 
other voice was saying, but he watch- 
ed the effect on the High Com- 
mander. Energy and determination 
were coming back, there were subtle 
signs of the return of force, of the 
tremendous conviction of being right. 
It was like watching the gentle glow 
when a fusion power lamp was 
ignited. 

“Yes,” Karlsen was saying. “Yes, 
well done.” 

Then he raised the Venerian pa- 
pers from his desk; it was as if he 
raised them only by force of will, 
his fingers only gesturing beneath 
them. 

“The news is from Hemphill,” 
he said to Mitch, almost absently. 
“The berserker fleet is just around 
the bulge of the Stone Place from 
us. Hemphill estimates they are two 
hundred strong, and thinks them un- 
aware of our presence. We attack at 
once. Man your battle station, Poet; 
God be with you.” He turned back 
to his communicator. “Ask Admiral 
Kemal to my cabin at once. Tell him 
to bring his staff. In particular — ” 
He glanced at the Venerian papers 
and read off several names. 

“Good luck to you, sir.” Mitch 
had delayed to say that. Before he 
hurried out, he saw Karlsen stuffing 
the Venerian papers into his trash 
disintegrator. 

B efore Mitch reached his own 
cabin, the battle horns were

•winding. He had armed and suited 
himself and was making his way 
back through the suddenly crowded 
narrow corridors toward the bridge, 
when the ship’s speakers boomed 
•uddenly to life, picking up Karl- 
•en*s voice: 

. whatever wrongs we have 
done you, by word, or deed, or by 
things left undone. I ask you now 
to forgive. And in the name of 
every man who calls me friend or 
leader, I pledge that any grievance 
we have against you, is from this 
moment wiped from memory.” 

Everyone in the crowded passage 
hesitated in the rush for battle sta- 
tions. Mitch found himself staring 
mto the eyes of a huge, well-armed 
Venerian ship’s policeman, probably 
here on the flagship as some of- 
ficer’s bodyguard. 

There came an amplified cough 
and rumble, and then the voice of 
Admiral Kemal: 

“We — we are brothers, Esteeler 
an^l Venerian, and all of us. All of 
us, together now, the living against 
th£ berserker.” Kemal’s voice rose 
to a shout: “Destruction to the 
damned machines, and death to their 
builders! Let every man remember 
Atsog!” 

“Remember Atsog!” roared Karl- 
aen’s voice. 

In the corridor there was a mo- 
ment’s hush, like that before a tower- 
ing wave smites down. Then a great 
insensate shout. Mitch found him- 
self with tears in his eyes, yelling 
something. 

“Remember General Bradin,” 
cried the big Venerian, grabbing 
Mitch and hugging him, lifting him, 



armor and all. “Death to his flay- 
ers!” 

“Death to the flayers!” The shout 
ran like a flame through the corri- 
dors. No one needed to be told 
that the same things were happen- 
ing in all the ships in the fleet. All 
at once there was no room for any- 
thing less than brotherhood, no 
time for anything less than glory. 

“Destruction to the damned ma- 
chines ! rt 

Near the flagship’s center of 
gravity was the bridge, only a dais 
holding a ring of combat chairs, 
each with its clustered controls and 
dials. 

“Boarding Coordinator ready,” 
Mitch reported, strapping himself in. 

The viewing sphere near the 
bridge’s center showed the human 
advance, in two leapfrogging lines 
of over a hundred ships each. Each 
ship was a green dot in the sphere, 
positioned as truthfully as the flag- 
ship’s computers could manage. The 
irregular surface of the Stone Place 
moved beside the battle lines in a 
series of jerks; the flagship was 
traveling by C-plus microjumps, so 
the presentation in the viewing 
sphere was a succession of still pic- 
tures at second-and-a-half intervals. 
Slowed by the mass of their C-plus 
cannon, the six fat green symbols of 
the Venerian heavy weapons ships 
labored forward, falling behind the 
rest of the fleet. 

I n Mitch’s headphones someone 
was saying: “In about ten min- 
utes we can expect to reach — ” 
The voice died away. There was 
a red dot in the sphere already, and 



32 



IP 




then another, and then a dozen, 
rising like tiny suns around the 
bulge of dark nebula. For long sec- 
onds the men on the bridge were 
silent while the berserker advance 
came into view. Hemphill’s scout- 
ing party must, after all, have been 
detected, for the berserker fleet was 
not cruising, but attacking. There 
was a battlenet of a hundred or 
more red dots, and now there were 
two nets, leapfrogging in and out of 
space like the human lines. And still 
the red berserkers rose into view, 
their formations growing, spreading 
out to englobe and crush a smaller 
fleet. 

“I make it three hundred ma- 
chines,” said a pedantic and some- 
what effeminate voice, breaking the 
silence with cold precision. Once, the 
mere knowledge that three hundred 
berserkers existed might have 
crushed all human hopes. In this 
place, in this hour, fear itself could 
frighten no one. 

The voices in Mitch’s headphones 
began to transact the business of 
opening a battle. There was nothing 
yet for him to do but listen and 
watch. 

The six heavy green marks were 
falling further behind; without hesi- 
tation, Karlsen was hurling his en- 
tire fleet straight at the enemy cen- 
ter. The foe’s strength had been un- 
derestimated, but it seemed the ber- 
serker command had made a simi- 
lar error, because the red formations 
too were being forced to regroup, 
spread themselves wider. 

The distance between fleets was 
still too great for normal weapons 
to be effective, but the laboring 



heavy-weapons ships with their C- 
. plus cannon were now in range, and 
they could fire through friendly 
formations almost as easily as not 
At their volley Mitch thought he 
felt space jar around him; it was 
some freak secondary effect that the 
human brain noticed, really only 
wasted energy. Each projectile, 
blasted by explosives to a safe dis- 
tance from the launching ship, 
mounted its own C-plus engine, 
which then accelerated the projectile 
while it flickered in and out of 
reality on microtimers. 

Their leaden masses magnified by 
velocity, the huge slugs skipped 
through existence like stones across 
water, passing like phantoms through 
the fleet of life, emerging fully into 
normal space only as they approach- 
ed their target, traveling then like 
de Broglie wavieles, their matter 
churning internally with a phase 
velocity greater than that of light 

Almost instantly after Mitch felt 
the slugs’ ghostly passage, one red 
dot began to expand and thin into 
a cloud, still tiny in the viewing 
sphere. Someone gasped. In a feW 
more moments, the flagship’s own 
weapons, beams and missiles, went 
into action. 

The enemy center stopped, two 
million miles ahead, but his flanks 
came on smoothly as the screw of 
a vast meat-grinder, threatening en- 
globement of the first line of hu- 
man ships. 

K arlsen did not hesitate, and a 
great turning point flickered 
past in a second. The life-fleet 
hurtled on, deliberately into, the 



STONE PLACE 



3S 




trap, straight for the hinge of the 
jaws. 

Space twitched and warped around 
Mitchell Spain. Every ship in the 
fleet was firing now, and every 
enemy answering, and the energies 
released plucked through his armor 
like ghostly fingers. Green dots and 
red vanished from the sphere, but 
not many of either as yet. 

The voices in Mitch’s helmet 
slackened, as events raced into a 
pattern that shifted too fast for hu- 
man thought to follow. Now for a 
time the fight would be computer 
against computer, faithful slave of 
life against outlaw, neither caring, 
neither knowing. 

The viewing sphere on the flag- 
ship’s bridge was shifting ranges al- 
most in a flicker. One swelling red 
dot was only a million miles away, 
then half of that, then half again. 
And now the flagship came into 
normal space for the final lunge 
of the attack, firing itself like a 
bullet at the enemy. 

Again the viewer switched to a 
closer range, and the chosen foe was 
no longer a red dot, but a great for- 
bidding castle, tilted crazily, black 
against the stars. Only a hundred 
miles away, then half of that. The 
velocity of closure slowed to less 
than a mile a second. As expected, 
the enemy was accelerating, trying 
to get away from what must look 
to it like a suicide charge. For the 
last time Mitch checked his chair, 
his suit, his weapons. Chris , be safe 
in a cocoon. The berserker swelled 
in the sphere, gun flashes showing 
now around his steel-ribbed belly. 
A small one, this, maybe only ten 



times the flagship’s bulk. Always a 
rotten spot to be found, in every 
one of them, under their skins old 
wounds, for the life of the galaxy 
had fought them for fifty thousand 
years. Try to run, you monstrous 
obsenity, try in vain. 

Closer, twisting closer. Now! 

Lights all gone, falling in the 
dark for one endless second — 

Impact. Mitch’s chair shook him, 
the gentle pads inside his armor 
battering and bruising him.' The 
expendable ramming prow would be 
vaporizing, shattering and crump- 
ling, dissipating energy down to a 
level the battering-ram ship could 
endure. 

When the crashing stopped, noise 
still remained, a whining droning 
symphony of stressed metal and es- 
caping air and gasses, like sobbing 
breathing. The great machines were 
locked together now, half the length 
of the flagship embedded in the 
berserker. 

A rough ramming, but no one on 
the bridge was injured. Damage con- 
trol reported that the expected air 
leaks were being controlled. Gun- 
nery reported that it could extend 
no turret inside the wound yet. Drive 
reported ready for a maximum ef- 
fort. 

Drive! 

T he ship twisted in the wound 
it had made. This could be 
victory, here tearing the enemy 
open, sawing his metal bowels out 
into space. The bridge twisted with 
the structure of the ship, this war- 
ship that was more solid metal than 
anything else. For a moment, Mitch 



34 



IP 




thought he could come close to 
comprehending the power of the 
engines men had built. 

“No use, Commander. We’re 
wedged in.” 

The enemy endured. The berserk- 
er memory would already be search- 
ed, the plans made, the counterat- 
tack on the flagship coming, with- 
out fear or mercy. 

The Ship Commander turned his 
head to look at Johann Karlsen. It 
had been foreseen that once a battle 
had reached this melee stage there 
would be little a High Commander 
could do. Even if the flagship were 
not half-buried in an enemy hull, 
all space nearby was a complete in- 
ferno of confused destruction, 
through which any meaningful com- 
munication would be impossible. If 
Karlsen was helpless now, neither 
could the berserker computers still 
link themselves into a single brain. 

“Fight your ship, sir,” said Karl- 
sen. He leaned forward, gripping 
the arms of his chair, staring at the 
clouded viewing sphere as if trying 
to make sense of the few flickering 
lights within it. 

The Ship Commander immediate- 
ly ordered his marines to board. 

Mitch saw them out the sally 
ports. Then, sitting still was worse 
than any action. “Sir, I request 
permission to join the boarders.” 

Karlsend seemed not to hear. He 
disqualified himself, for now, from 
any use of power; especially to set 
Mitchell Spain in the forefront of 
the battle, or to hold him bade. 

The Ship Commander considered. 
He wanted to keep a Boarding Co- 
ordinator on the bridge; but ex- 



perienced men could be desperately 
short in the fighting. “Go, then. Do 
what you can to help defend our 
sally ports.” 

IX 

T his berserker defended itself well 
with soldier-robots. The ma- 
rines had hardly gotten away from 
the embedded hull when the counter- 
attack came, cutting most of them 
off. 

In a narrow zig-zag passage lead- 
ing out to the port near which fight- 
ing was heaviest, an armored figure 
met Mitch. “Captain Spain? I’m 
Sergeant Broom, acting Defense 
Commander here. Bridge says you’re 
to take over. It’s a little rough. 
Gunnery can’t get a turret work- 
ing inside the wound. The danker* 
have all kinds of room to maneuver, 
and they keep coming at us.” 

“Let’s get out there, then.” 

The two of them hurried forward, 
through a passage that became only 
a warped slit. The flagship was bent 
here, a strained swordblade forced 
into a chink of armor. 

“Nothing rotten here,” said Mitch, 
climbing at last out of the sally port. 
There were sudden distant flashes 
of light, and the sudden glow of hot 
metal, by which to see braced gir- 
ders, like tall buildings, among 
which the flagship had jammed it- 
self. 

“Eh? No.” Broom must be won- 
dering what he was talking about. 
But die sergeant stuck to business, 
pointing out to Mitch where he had 
about a hundred men disposed 
among the chaos of tom metal and 



STONE PLACE 



35 





drifting debris. “The clankers don’t 
use guns. They just drift in, sneak- 
ing, or charge in a wave, and get 
at us hand-to-hand, if they can. 
Last wave we lost six men.” 

Whining gusts of gas came out of 
the deep caverns, and scattered blobs 
of liquid, along with the flashes of 
light, and deep shudders through 
the metal. The damned thing might 
be dying, or just getting ready to 
fight; there was no way to tell. 

“Any more of the boarding par- 
ties get back?” Mitch asked. 

“No. Doesn’t look good for ’em.” 
“Port defense, this is gunnery,” 
said a cheerful radio voice. “We’re 
getting the eighty-degree upper for- 
ward turret working.” 

“Well, then use it!” Mitch rasped 
back. “We’re inside, you can’t help 
hitting something!” 



A minute later, searchlights moved 
out from doored recesses in the 
flagship’s hull, and stabbed into the 
great chaotic cavern. 

“Here they come again!” yelled 
Broom. Hundreds of meters away, 
beyond the melted stump of the 
flagship’s prow, a line of figures 
drifted nearer. The searchlights ques- 
tioned them; they were not suited 
men. Mitch was opening his mouth 
to yell when the turret fired, ‘throw- 
ing a raveling skein of sheel bursts 
across the advancing rank of ma- 
chines. 

But more ranks were coming. 
Men were firing in every direction 
at machines that came clambering, 
jetting, drifting, in hundreds. 

M itch took off from the sally 
port, moving in diving weight- 
less leaps, touring the outposts, shift- 
ing men when the need arose. 

“Fall back when you have to!” 
he ordered, on command radio. 
“Keep them from the sally ports!” 
His men faced no lurching con- 
scription of mechanized pipefitters 
and moving welders; these devices 
were built, in one shape or another, 
to fight. As he dove between out- 
posts, a thing like a massive chain 
looped itself to intercept Mitch; 
he broke it in half with his second 
shot. A metallic butterfly darted 
at him on brilliant jets, and away 
again, and he wasted four shots 
at it. 

He found an outpost abandoned, 
and started back toward the sally 
port, radioing ahead: “Broom, how 
is it there?” 

“Hard to tell, Captain. Squad 



36 



IF 



leader*, check in again, squad 
leaders — ” 

The flying thing darted back; 
Mitch sliced it with his laser pistol. 
As he approached the sally port, 
weapons were flaring all around 
him. This interior fight was turning 
into a microcosm of the confused 
struggle between fleets. He knew 
that still raged, for the ghostly fin- 
gers of heavy weapons still pluck- 
ed through his armor continually. 

“Here they come again — Dog, 
Easy, Nine-o , clock. ,, 

Coordinates of an attack straight 
at the sally port. Mitch found a 
place to wedge himself, and raised 
his carbine again. Many of the ma- 
chines in this wave bore metal 
diields before them. He fired and 
reloaded, again and again. 

The flagship’s one usable turret 
flamed steadily, and an almost con- 
tinuous line of explosions marched 
across the machines’ ranks in va- 
cuum-silence, along with a travers- 
ing searchlight spot. The automatic 
cannons of the turret were far heavi- 
er than the marines’ hand weapons; 
almost anything the cannon hit dis- 
solved in radii of splinters. But sud- 
denly there were machines on the 
flagship hull, attacking the turret 
from its blind side. 

Mitch called out warning, and 
started in that direction. Then all 
at once the enemy was around him. 
Two things caught a nearby man 
in their crab-like claws, trying to 
tear him apart between them. Mitch 
fired quickly at the moving figures 
and hit the man, blowing one leg 
off. 

A moment later one of the crab- 



machines was knocked away and 
broken by a hailstorm of shells. 
The other one beat the armored 
man to pieces against a jagged gird- 
er, and turned to look for its next 
piece of work. 

This machine was armored like a 
warship. It spotted Mitch and came 
for him, climbing through drifting 
rubble, shells and slugs rocking it 
but not crippling. It gleamed in his 
suit lights, reaching out bright 
pincers, as he emptied his carbine 
at the box where its cybernetics 
should be. 

H e drew his pistol and dodged, 
but like a falling cat it turned 
at him. It caught him by the left 
hand and the helmet, metal squeal- 
ing and crunching. He thrust the 
laser pistol against what he thought 
was the brainbox, and held the trig- 
ger down. He and the machine were 
drifting, it could get no leverage for 
its strength. But it held him, work- 
ing on his armored hand and helmet. 

Its brainbox, the pistol and tho 
fingers of his right gauntlet, were 
glowing hot. Something molten spat- 
tered across his faceplate, the glare 
half-blinding him. The laser burn- 
ed out, fusing its barrel to the ene- 
my in a glowing weld. 

His left gauntlet, still caught, was 
giving way, being crushed — 

— his hand — 

Even as his suit’s hypos and 
tourniquet bit him, he got his burn- 
ed right hand free of the laser’s 
butt and trigger guard and reached 
the plastic grenades at his belt. 

His left arm was going wooden, 
even before the claw released his 



STONE PLACE 



37 




mangled hand and fumbled slowly 
for a fresh grip. The machine was 
shuddering afl o ver, Kke an agonized 
man. Mitch whipped his right arm 
around to plaster a grenade on the 
far side of the brainbox. Then with 
arms and legs he strained against 
the crushing, groping claws. His 
suit-servos whined wkh overload, 
being overpowered, two seconds, 
dose eyes, three — 

The explosion stunned him. He 
found himself drifting free. Lights 
were flaring. Somewhere was a sally 
port; he had to get there and de- 
fend it. 

His head cleared slowly. He had 
the feeling that someone was press- 
ing a pair of fingers against his 
chest. He hoped that was only some 
reaction from the hand. It was hard 
to see anything, with his faceplate 
still half-covered with splashed 
metal, but at last he spotted the flag- 
ship hull. A chunk of something 
came within reach, and he used k 
to propel himself toward the sally 
port, spinning weakly. He dug out 
a fresh clip of ammunition and then 
realized his carbine was gone. 

The space near the sally port was 
foggy with shattered mechanism; 
and there were stffl men here, fir- 
ing their weapons out into the great 
cavern. Mitch recognized Broom’s 
armor in. the flaring lights, and got 
a welcoming wave. 

“Captain! They’ve knocked out 
the turret, and most of our search- 
lights. But we’ve wrecked an aw- 
ful lot of ’em — how’s your arm?” 
“Feels like wood. Got a carbine?” 
“Say again?” 

Broom couldn’t hear him. Of 



course, the damned thing had 
squeezed his helmet and probably 
wrecked his radio transmitter. He 
put his helmet against Broom’s, and 
said: “You’re in charge. I’m going 
in. Get back out if I can.” 

Broom was nodding, guiding him 
watchfully toward the port. Gun 
flashes started up around them thick 
and fast again, but there was nothing 
he could do about that, with two 
steady dull fingers pressing into his 
chest. Lightheaded. Get back out? 
Who was he fooling? Lucky if he 
got in without help. 

He went into the port, past the 
interior guards’ niches, and through 
an airlock. A medic took one look 
and came to help him. 

N ot dead yet, he thought, aware 
of people and lights around 
him. There was something else to 
notice, too; he felt no more ghostly 
plucking of space-bending weapons. 
Then he understood that he was be- 
ing wheeled out of surgery, and 
that people hurrying by had triumph 
in their faces. He was still too grog- 
gy to frame a coherent question, 
but words he heard seemed to mean 
that another ship had joined in the 
attack on this berserker. That was 
a good sign, that there were spare 
ships around. 

The stretcher bearers set him 
down near the bridge, in an area 
that was being used as a recovery 
room; there were many wounded, 
strapped down and given breathing 
tubes against possible failure of 
gravity or air. Mitch could see signs 
of battle damage around him. How 
could that be, this far inside the 




ihip. The sally ports had been held. 

There was a long gravitic shudder. 
“They’ve disengaged her,” said 
someone nearby. 

Mitch passed out for a little while. 
The next thing he could see was 
that people were converging on the 
bridge from all directions. Their 
faces were happy and wondering, 
as if some joyful signal had called 
them. Many of them carried what 
seemed to Mitch the strangest as- 
sortment of burdens : weapons, 

books, helmets, bandages, trays of 
food, bottles, even bewildered chil- 
dren, who must have been just res- 
cued from the berserker’s grip. 

Mitch hitched himself up on his 
right elbow, ignoring the twinges in 
his bandaged chest and burnt fin- 
gers. Still he could not see the com- 
bat chairs of the bridge, for the 
people moving between. 

From all the corridors of the 
ship they came, solemnly happy, 
men and women crowding together 
in the brightening lights. 

An hour or so later, Mitch roused 
to find that a viewing sphere had 
been set up nearby. The space where 
the battle had been was a jagged 
new nebula of gaseous metal, a few 
little fireplace coals against the 
ebony folds of the Stone Place. 
Someone near Mitch was tiredly, 
but with animation, telling the story 
to a recorder: 

“ — fifteen ships and about eight 
thousand men lost are our present 
count. Every one of our ships seems 
to be damaged. We estimate ninety 
— that’s nine-zero — berserkers 
destroyed. Last count was a hundred 
and seventy-six captured, or wreck- 



ing themselves. It’s still hard to be- 
lieve. A day like this ... we must 
remember that thirty or more of 
them escaped, and are as deadly as 
ever. We will have to go on hunt- 
ing and fighting them for a long 
time, but their power as a fleet has 
been broken. We can hope that cap- 
turing this many machines will at 
last give us some definite lead on 
their origin. Ah, best of all, some 
twelve thousand human prisoners 
have been freed. 

“Now, how to explain our suc- 
cess? Those of us not Believers of 
one kind or another will say victory 
came because our hulls were newer 
and stronger, our long-range wea- 
pons new and superior, our tactics 
unexpected by the enemy — and 
our marines able to defeat anything 
the berserkers could send against 
them. 

“Above all, history will give credit 
to High Commander Karlsen, for 
his decision to attack, at a time 
when his reconciliation with the 
Venerians had inspired and united 
the fleet The High Commander is 
here now, visiting the wounded who 
lie in rows . 

K arlsen’s movements were so slow 
and tired that Mitch thought 
he too might be wounded, though 
no bandages were visible. He shuf- 
fled past the ranked stretchers, with 
a word or nod for each of the 
wounded. Beside Mitch’s pallet he 
stopped, as if recognition was a 
shock. 

“She’s dead. Poet,” were the first 
words he said. 

The ship turned under Mitch for 

3f 



STONE PUCE 




a moment; then he could be calm, 
as if he had expected to hear this. 
The battle had hollowed him out 

Karlsen was telling him, in a with- 
ered voice, how the enemy had 
forced through the flagship’s hull 
a kind of torpedo, an infernal ma- 
chine that seemed to know how the 
rtiip was designed, a moving atomic 
pile that had burned its way through 
the High Commander’s quarters and 
almost to the bridge before it could 
be stopped and quenched. 

The sight of battle damage here 
should have warned Mitch. But he 
hadn’t thought. Shock and drugs 
kept him from thinking or feeling 
much of anything now, but he could 
see her face, looking as it had in the 
gray deadly place from which he had 
rescued her. 

Rescued. 

I am a weak and foolish man,” 
Karlsen was saying. “But I have 
never been your enemy. Are you 
mine?” 

“No. You forgave all your ene- 
mies. Got rid of them. Now you 
won’t have any, for a while. Galac- 
tic hero. But, I don’t envy you.” 

“No. God rest her.” But Karl- 
sen’s face was still alive, under all 
the grief and weariness. Only death 
oould finally crush this man. He 



gave the ghost of a smile. “And, 
the second part of the prophecy, 
eh? I am to be defeated, and to 
die owning nothing. As if a man 
could die any other way.” 

“Karlsen, you’re all right. I think 
you may survive your own success. 
Die in peace, some day, still hoping 
for your Believers’ heaven.” 

“The day I die — ” Karlsen turn- 
ed his head slowly. “I’ll remember 
this day. This glory, this victory for 
aU men.” Under the weariness and 
grief he had still his tremendous 
assurance — not of being right, 
Mitch thought now, but of being 
committed to right. 

“Poet, when you are able, come 
and work for me.” 

“Someday, maybe. Now, I can 
live on the battle bounty. And I 
have work. If they can’t grow back 
my hand — why, I can write with 
one.” Mitch was suddenly very 
tired. 

A hand touched his good shoulder; 
a voice said; “God be with you. 
Johann Karlsen moved on. 

Mitch wanted only to rest. Then, 
to his work. The world was bad, 
and all men were fools — but there 
were men who would not be crush- 
ed. And that was a thing worth 
telling. END

MEETING 



ON KANGSHAN 

by ERIC FRANK RUSSELL 



His rendezvous was with a man 
he had not seen in half a human 
life — and with something else i 



W arhurst leaned on a tubular 
rail and watched the passen- 
gers boarding the ship. This was one 
of his favorite occupations, there be- 
ing nothing more sinful available. 
Nice to see a change of faces once 
in a while. Nicer still to see an oc- 
casional female one as reminder of 
the fact that the human race is not 
an all-male society. And, anyway, 
he liked to speculate about who these 
people were and what particular 
talents they possessed and why they 
were going wherever they were go- 
ing. 



Up the duralumin gangway they 
came, the fat and the thin, the short 
and the tall. The majority were men 
in their twenties or thirties. Adven- 
turous types willing to live in lone- 
liness and beat an existence out of 
alien soil. Fodder for the faraway. 
Among them might be a criminal 
or two as well as a few misanthropes. 
One man, a little balding and slight- 
ly older than the rest, wore a calm, 
phlegmatic air. Warhurst weighed 
him up as some kind of scientist or 
maybe a doctor. The three girls fol- 
lowing immediately behind had a 



41 



brisk, professional manner and might 
be nurses. There was a serious short- 
age of doctors and nurses out there. 

Van Someren joined him at the 
rail, draped himself over it and gazed 
down. He was the ship’s agent and, 
as the local representative of the 
owner, was entitled to enough respect 
to avoid a charge of mutiny. Chew- 
ing a splinter erf wood, he watched 
the ascending passengers as if seek- 
ing the one escaping with the green 
eye of the little yellow god. After a 
while he removed the splinter, 
straightened himself and spoke. 

“Take a look at Methuselah.” 

Obediently Warhurst took a look. 
A gangling and skinny oldster was 
coming aboard dragging a large and 
badly battered case. A ship’s loader 
tried to lend a hand with the case. 
The ancient repelled him fiercely 
with emphatic but unbearable words. 
Defiantly he lugged the case upward. 
His face became more visible as it 
neared: it was complete with two 
eyes, a nose and a pure white Fancy 
Dan mustache. The eyes were 
rheumy but shrewd, the nose was 
suffering from battle fatigue but still 
breathing. 

“Eighty if a day,” said Warhurst. 
"They must be scraping the bottom 
of the barrel.” 

“He’s all yours,” said Van Som- 
eren. 

“What d’you mean, all mine?” 

“You’re the deck officer. He’s a 
privileged passenger. Count it up on 
your fingers.” 

4 4 Teepers! Is he a trig stockholder 
or something?” 

“As far as I know he isn’t worth 



a cent. All I can say is that I have 
my orders and those are to teH you 
that old geezer’s name is William 
Harlow and that he’s a privileged 
passenger. I am further instructed to 
state with suitable emphasis that you 
will be held personally responsible 
for his safe arrival and that if you 
fail in this duty your offal will be 
required for feeding to the vul- 
tures.” 

“Nuts to that,” said Warhurst. “If 
he’s a chronic invalid he belongs to 
the ship’s medic.” 

“Since when have invalids been 
toted into the wilds?” 

“There has to be a first time,” 
Warhurst protested. 

“Well, this ain’t it. He’s not a sick 
man as far as I know. They wouldn’t 
ship him if he were.” 

“I should think so, too. We’ve no 
geriatric ward on this vessel.” 
“There’s no psychiatric one either 
but they let you zoom around.” Van 
Someren smirked triumphantly, had 
a brief chew on his hunk of wood, 
then diagnosed, “I know what’s the 
matter with you. You’ve figured on 
squiring those three dames around 
— on company time and with full 
pay.” 

“No harm in that, is there?” 

“I wouldn’t know, never having 
experienced your in-flight technique. 
But orders are orders and you obey 
them or walk the plank into shark- 
infested seas. The owners say you’re 
to nursemaid this Harlow relic. 
Think of him as your poor old father 
and treat him with filial care.” 

“Get out of my sight, you darned 
woodpecker,” said Warhurst. 

“All right, all right, have it your 



42 



IF 




#wn way.” Van Someren smirked 
igain and wandered off. 

Leaving the rail, Warhurst went 
below, pushed through a group of 
passengers cluttering a narrow cor- 
ridor, found his man standing firm- 
ly astride his big case. He went up 
lo him. 

“Mr. Harlow?” 

“Correct. Who told you?” 

“It’s my business to know these 
Aings. I’m Steve Warhurst.” 

“That’s a heck of a coincidence.” 

“What is?” 

“That being your name. Could 
easily have been anything else, Joe 
Snape, Theophilus Bagley or what- 
ever. But it had to be . what did 
you say?” 

“Steve Warhurst. I’m the deck of- 
ficer.” 

“That so? What do you do for a 
crust?” 

“I look after the welfare of the 
passengers,” explained Warhurst, 
patiently. 

“Man, you’ve got it made,” said 
Harlow. 

iiT do plenty of other things,” 

X Warhurst persisted, not liking 
the insinuation. “Taking care of the 
human ioad is only one of my jobs.” 

“I should think so, too. You’re 
wearing enough gold to be worth 
mining.” Harlow let his watery, 
yellow-tinged eyes examine the pas- 
sengers within visual range. “Real 
bunch of sissies. In my young days 
they needed no fancy-pants deck of- 
ficers. A man climbed aboard and 
strapped himself down good and 
tight. If a strap busted he got an 
eye knocked out.” 



“Things have changed,” Warhurst 
reminded. 

“So I’ve heard.” 

“Nobody has to be mummy- 
wrapped or encapsulated. We’ve got 
null-G. You’ll float like a feather 
as we rise. When the siren yowls 
we’ll both go up without the aid of 
nets.” 

“Human race is getting soft,” 
opined Mr. Harlow. 

“I’d like to see your transit 
voucher.” Warhurst prompted. 

“What for?” 

“It records your cabin number. 
I’ll take you to it.” 

“Listen,” ordered Harlow, baring 
a set of beaten-up teeth, “I know 
my cabin number and I’m capable of 
reaching it under my own steam.” 

“I wasn’t suggesting wheeling you 
there. I merely want to show you 
where it is.” 

“Show me?” Harlow registered in- 
credulity. “Let me tell you I’ve found 
my way through places that’d give 
you the holy horrors. I don’t need 
any snub-nosed kid to tell me which 
way to go.” 

“No offense,” soothed Warhurst. 
“How about me helping you with 
your case?” 

“Sooot!” bawled Harlow. 

First Officer Winterton, who hap- 
pened to be passing, stopped and 
asked, “Is something wrong?” 

“This gilded cutie,” informed 
Harlow, nodding at Warhurst, 
“thinks I’m a cripple.” 

“I offered to help with his case,” 
explained Warhurst. 

“There you are — what did I tell 
you?” said Harlow. 

“It was quite proper of him,” 



MEETING ON KANGSHAN 



43 




Winterton assured Harlow. “Mr. 
Warhurst is the ship’s host so far as 
the passengers are concerned.” 
“Then why doesn’t he pick on the 
others? Some of ’em are making 
ready to faint.” 

“Why didn’t you?” Winterton 
asked Warhurst, secretly beginning 
to regret his intervention. 

“The agent said he was a P.P.” 

H arlow let go his grip on his case, 
grabbed Warhurst’s tie, pulled 
its knot to quarter size and growled, 
“if you want to call me names cafl 
’em proper, as main to man.” 

“A P.P. is a privileged passenger,” 
said Warhurst, fighting for breath. 

“Privileged?” He let go the tie, 
irritated and baffled. “Never asked 
for a privilege in my life and I’m not 
starting now.” 

“You don’t have to ask. The status 
is thrust upon you.” 

“Why?” 

“How the devil should I know 
why?” retorted Warhurst, feeling far 
from jovial himself. He freed his 
neck and pumped oxygen. “I get 
orders and I don’t question the rea- 
sons for them.” 

“There aren’t any reasons,” Har- 
low informed. “Some jerk of a clerk 
must have got things mixed up. Is 
there a big shot named Barlow on 
board?” 

“No.” 

“Can’t be him then, can it? Not if 
he isn’t here. Anyway, nobody’s go- 
ing to coddle me, see? Prize fool 
I’d look being baby-sitted by some 
young squirt dolled up like a Christ- 
mas tree.” 

“The young squirt,” Winterton 



pointed out, “happens to be forty- 
two years old and has twenty years 
of space service behind him.” 

“Just as I thought,” said Harlow. 
“Still wet behind the ears and got 
plenty to learn. I could eat six like 
him before breakfast and still be afl 
set for a real feed.” He gripped his 
case and heaved it off the floor, his 
fingers thin and veined, with 
knuckles like knobs. “You decor- 
ated dummies go and prop up the 
staggerers. I can fend for myself,” 
he grunted. 

Case in hand, he went along the 
corridor and peered at the number 
on each cabin door. His pace was 
slow, laborious. Turning the end 
corner, he passed from sight. 

“Awkward customer, huh?” said 
Warhurst. 

“A savage old-timer,” decided 
Winterton. “Aren’t many of them 
left these days. Wonder why he’s 
been rated a P.P. The last one I 
came across was a retired employee. 
Been fifty years with the company. 
They gave him free passage to Earth 
along with the full treatment.” 

“We’re not heading for home,” 
said Warhurst. 

“Yeah, I know. We’re making for 
six underpopulated underdeveloped 
planets reserved exclusively for the 
young and healthy. The powers- that- 
be seem to have made an exception 
for this Harlow character. I can’t 
imagine why.” 

“Maybe he’s not fit to live with 
so they’re isolating him in the never- 
never.” 

“Oh, he’s not that bad.” 

“I know,” said Warhurst. “I was 
only kidding.” 




T hey were four days out before 
Warhurst renewed the encoun- 
ter. He’d been kept busy awhile on 
various matters that always crowded 
up immediately after departure or 
shortly before arrival. The interim 
period was the time when he could 
pay more attention to social duties. 

In dress uniform, with face close- 
ly shaved and pants pressed, he 
went to the lounge all set to play 
the part of guide, companion and 
father confessor to any lonely hearts 
who might be moping around. It 
was a job that had endless possibil- 
ities none of which ever came to 
anything. As he expressed it in his 
more complaining moments, when- 
ever the basket of fruit was being 
handed around he invariably got the 
lemon. 

And again it was so. The fem- 
inine portion of the ship’s load ob- 
viously was neither solitary nor 
bored. There was a clinking of glass- 
es and a steady babble of conversa- 
tion and no sweet face was visibly 
yearning for his company. Only old 
Harlow sat by himself, hunched in 
a corner behind a small and empty 
table. 

With a shrug of resignation War- 
hurst crossed the lounge, said, 
“Mind if I sit here?” 

“I can suffer it. Had plenty of 
worse things happen to me.” 

“You seem to have survived,” 
said Warhurst, offering a wary 
smile. 

“What comes of pulling my head 
in every time the chopper fell.” 
Harlow inspected him with faint 
disapproval. “Done yourself up for 
Sunday, huh? How oome you’re 



picking on me? Those girls refuse 
to be fascinated?” 

“The ladies are being entertained, 
as you can see.” 

“Good thing, too. Keep ’em out 
of mischief.” He glowered across 
the room and muttered something 
under his breath. Then he inform- 
ed, “Soon as I came in one of ’em 
put on a sloppy smile and said, 
‘Hello, Pop!’ Must think I’m a 
penny balloon or something. Pop! 
Put her in her place, I did. Told 
her my name is Bill and not to for- 
get it.” 

“Mind if 1 call you Bill?” 

“Call me any durned thing you 
like so long as it ain’t Pop.” 

“Same with me. I don’t care 
what I’m called so long as it isn’t 
a gilded cutie or a snub-nosed 
kid.” 

“Oh, well, fair’s fair, I guess.” 
“You can call me Steve.” 

“Knew a fellow of that name 
once. Went into Reedstar and never 
came out. Tough luck — but that’s 
the way it is.” 

“The way what is?” 

4 4T ife,” said Harlow. “They 
-L' come and they go and 
some never come back.” 

Warhurst changed the subject 
“Care to have a drink with me?” 
“Depends. Wouldn’t give belly 
room to all this cocktail muck. 
Strictly for women that stuff is. 
Hammerhead juice is the only thing 
fit to drink and they don’t know 
what it is these days. Human race 
is going down the drain.” 

“Leave it to me.” Warhurst got 
up and went to the bar. “Joe, the 



MEETING ON KANGSHAN 



45 




old fellow I'm with likes a blow- 
torch pointed down his gullet. Says 
there’s nothing like hammerhead 
juice. What have you got that he 
might consider a few cuts above 
goat’s milk?” 

With narrowed eyes Joe gazed 
across the lounge and studied Har- 
low. He seemed to be struggling 
with a problem. Finally he bent 
under the counter and came up 
with a bottle and poured a measure 
of green, oily liquid. 

“This should be diluted with gin. 
He’s getting it raw. Comes as near 
as it can get to being unfit for hu- 
man consumption. Same for you?” 
“No, sir. Got to think of the fire 
hazard. I’ll have a shot of crew- 
rum, official issue.” 

Joe served that too, leaned over 
the bar and whispered, “Know who 
that old dodderer is?” 

“No. Do you?” 

“No.” 

“Then we’re back where we start- 
ed.” 

“Listen,” urged Joe, “and I’ll tell 
you something. I’ve been at this job 
as long as you’ve been at yours. 
I’ve never seen hammerhead juice 
and nobody’s ever asked for it and 
I haven’t got any.” 

“It’s just his figure of speech,” 
suggested Warhurst. “He means 
some kind of rotgut.” 

“Listen,” ordered Joe for the sec- 
ond time. “I’ve never seen the stuff 
but I have heard of it. My father 
used to mention it when he con- 
ned me into growing up and follow- 
ing him into the space service. Ac- 
cording to him only one bunch 
ever asked for it and had the in- 



testinal fortitude to beat it into sub- 
mission.” He paused to give a well- 
calculated touch of drama, finish- 
ed, “The Legion of Planetary 
Scouts.” 

“It adds up,” said Warhurst im- 
passively. Picking up the drinks, 
he took them across, carefully 
placed them on the table. He sat 
down and looked at Harlow. “In 
the long ago those drinks would 
have been two tantalising globules 
floating around in mid-air. We'd 
have had to swim after them, 
gulping like goldfish. But now we 
can lay gravity on the floor like a 
carpet or roll it up and hide H in 
the attic when we don’t want it. 
Things have changed. I told you 
that before, didn’t I?” 

“You did.” 

4 4TT 7eh, I apologize for doing so. 

▼ V I took it for granted that 
you hadn’t been on a ship in yean 
— and you said nothing to disillu- 
sion me. I was wrong.” 

“How have you figured k out?” 
asked Harlow, eyeing him care- 
fully. 

Warhurst jerked a thumb toward 
the bar. “Joe there says nobody 
but planetary scouts ever asked foe 
hammerhead juice.” 

“Fat lot he knows about it. He’s 
not old enough to remember.” 
“His father told him.” 

“That so? Maybe he was right 
I dunno.” 

“You do know,” Warhurst in- 
sisted. “I think you’ve been a 
planetary scout and that you may 
be one of the last of the original 
legion.”

“There’ll never be a last, not so 
long as photographic reconnaisance 
Isn’t enough and somebody has to 
trudge on foot to see what’s under 
the mist and the trees.” Harlow 
gulped his drink, clamped his eyes 
shut and gripped the rim of the 
table. Then he opened the eyes, let 
out a brief gasp and said, “Not bad 
for cough medicine. Gives a feller 
a slight jolt.” 

“Joe thinks it verges on cyanide.” 
“He would. They’re weak at the 
knees these days.” 

“See here, Bill, tell me some- 
thing. When were you last on a 
ship?” 

“Couple of years ago.” 

“A passenger liner?” 

“No — it was a government sur- 
vey ship.” 

“With null-G?” 

“You bet,” said Harlow em- 
phatically. “Couldn’t have gone the 
distance otherwise. Even at that it 
took plenty long enough to return 
to base.” 

“How long?” 

“What’s it to you?” 

“Nothing at all,” admitted War- 
hurst. “I’m just plain nosey. How 
long did it take?” 

“Fourteen years,” informed Har- 
low with some reluctance. 

W arhurst rocked back. “Four- 
teen? Ye gods! Any G-less 
ship using up that much time must 
have been out to the very edge of 
exploration.” 

“That’s right. Fourteen out and 
fourteen back. And I was stuck 
there for eight years as well, given 
up for lost. That makes thirty-six 



in all. A slice out of a man’s life.” 
He took a good suck at his drink, 
repeated the eye-closing and table- 
gripping business, said, “Hah!” and 
then finished, “After which 1 had 
a fight on my hands.” 

“Over what?” 

“Feller called me a liar.” 

“Didn’t he believe you’d been 
gone that long?” 

“He believed it all right. Couldn't 
deny the facts. Made a long, oily 
speech about the time I’d put in 
and the immense value of the re- 
ports I’d made. Real greasy type he 
was, with medals and badges and 
gold rings on his sleeves and a 
fancied-up cap like yours. Buttered 
me all over — and then called me 
a liar.” 

“Why?” 

“Said that around the time I had 
left — which was before he was 
born — I’d not told the truth about 
my age and that he had the docu- 
mentary evidence to prove it. Said 
I should never have been sent out 
in the first place and that it was a 
damned disgrace.” 

“Had you told the truth?” War- 
hurst pressed. 

“Didn’t tell a lie,” Harlow evad- 
ed. “Told ’em I was plenty young 
enough to go ten times round the 
galaxy.” 

“And were you?” 

“Yes, sir! I still am.” Harlow 
scowled at the floor. “This pud- 
ding-headed pipsqueak wasn’t buy- 
ing that. Said I was far too old for 
further service and that I’d be given 
free passage back to Terra. Durn 
it, I’m only eighty-eight and that's 
me, bang, slap, finish. A dead dog. 



MEETING ON KANGSHAN

I got riled. Terra, I yelled, Terra? 
Haven’t seen the place in nearly 
seventy years and don’t know a 
soul there. What’s on Terra for me? 
Nothing! If you’re exporting the 
garbage you can ship me to Kang- 
shan. At least I’ve got an old part- 
ner there.” 

“What did he say to that?” 
“Wouldn’t look me straight in 
the eyes. Muttered something about 
how Kangshan was strictly for char- 
acters a lot younger than me. Said he 
didn’t think they’d have me there 
even if he got down on his knees 
and begged.” 

“You had an answer to that 
one, I guess?” 

4 4 Cure did. Told him he wasn’t 
O old enough to speak for 
others. Told him to signal Kang- 
shan and ask if they’d take me.” 
“Which I presume he did.” 

“Must have done, though he took 
long enough about it. Eventually 
another official nincompoop hand- 
ed me my sailing orders and made 
another oily speech. I tell you, 
Warble — ” 

“Warhurst. Steve Warhurst.” 

“I tell you if brass-hat gab could 
be boosted through tubes we’d all 
be way out beyond. Seems more 
talk than action these days. Human 
race is losing its capacity to suffer.” 
“I wouldn’t say that. Bill. Things 
done the hard way aren’t neces- 
sarily done better. Nor are they 
done badly because done the easy 
way. The essence of progress con- 
sists of finding ways of avoiding 
oldtime difficulties.” 

“That may be, bat — ” Harlow 



paused, mused & short while, ven- 
tured, “Well, maybe I'm not as 
young as I used to be. But that 
doesn’t make me a dead dog, does 
it?” 

“Not at all.” 

“Kangshan doesn’t think so.” 
“You say you’ve got a partner 
there?” 

“Yes, Jim Lacey. He’s all I’ve 
got in creation. No scout operates 
alone except by accident. They go 
places in small bunches or often in 
pairs. You fellows who zoom around 
in shiploads don’t know what part- 
nership really means. A man’s side- 
kick is his only contact with the 
human race when the rest of it is 
multi-million miles away. He’s an- 
other brain to help solve problems, 
another pair of hands to work and 
fight. With each other a couple of 
trouble-seekers can get by in cir- 
cumstances where if alone they’d 
go nuts. So I'm telling you that in 
faraway places partnership is some- 
thing very special.” 

“I can well imagine,” said War- 
hurst. 

“Lacey was my first and longest 
space-partner. We were born in the 
same town, lived on the same street, 
went to the same schools and even- 
tually joined the service together. We 
were dropped into some hot spots 
and shared the grief when things 
became rough and tough. Now I’m 
going to Kangshan. I promised I’d 
meet him there.” 

“After best part of forty years 
he wouldn’t figure on seeing you 
again, would he?” 

With a stubborn set to his jaw, 
Harlow repeated, “I said I’d meet 



48 



IF 




him and that’s all that matters.” He 
stood up, a little creakily, “My turn. 
Same again?” Warhurst nodded. 

Taking the empty glasses, Har- 
low carried them to the bar. “A 
crew-rum and another shot of that 
green hair oil.” 

“Like it, Pop?” asked Joe, willing 
to be sociable. 

Harlow hammered on the bar and 
bawled, “Don’t call me Pop, you 
bottle-juggling ape! I could out- 
march you with a ninety-pound 
pack and then do a tap dance.” 
Grabbing the drinks, he brought 
them back, seated himself and snarl- 
ed, “Booze-slingers in space. They’ll 
be organizing beauty contests next. 
Human race is on die skids.” 

“Here’s to the old days,” said 
Warhurst. He drank, wobbled his 
Adam’s apple, closed his eyes and 
held on tight. “For a beginner you 
show promise, Wharton.” 

“Warhurst, if you don’t mind.” 

r here was the inevitable spell of 
rushed work before the land- 
ing but Warhurst got through it in 
good time and stationed himself at 
the head of the gangway. The 
formality was always the same; as 
each passenger began the descent 
Warhurst put on his most cordial 
smile and speeded the parting guest 
with a word of good cheer. 

“Hope you’ve enjoyed your trip, 
Mr. Soandso. Good-by! Best of 
luck!” 

Harlow came last, having listen- 
ed to the swan song a dozen times 
while waiting beside his big case. 
Heaving the case forward, he stop- 
ped at the top of the steps. 



“Why don’t they tape it and save 
you the bother? Thought you said 
there’s nothing wrong with doing 
things the easy way.” 

“Passengers like the personal 
touch.” 

“They would. Mothers’ pets. Think 
they’re mighty tough but I could 
beat ’em away with my hat.” His 
watery eyes gazed across the primi- 
tive spaceport and into the far dis- 
tance. “Last landing for me. Just 
as well, I reckon. Got to come 
sometime and it might as well be 
now.” 

Warhurst held out a hand. “Good- 
by, Bill. Glad to have known you.” 

Giving the hand a couple of 
prim shakes, Harlow responded with, 
“We got along, Warburton.” Then 
he lugged his case down the steps 
and across the tarmac. A big, beefy 
man met him, chatted briefly, tried 
to take the case and was fiercely 
repelled. The big man then led him 
to a private floater and climbed 
aboard. Harlow got his case in and 
followed. A few seconds later the 
floater emitted a high-pitched whine, 
shuddered a couple of times, then 
soared. Heading swiftly north- 
ward, it diminished to a dot and 
vanished. 

Winterton appeared at the exit, 
said with satisfaction, “All off. 
That’s got rid of another menager- 
ie.” 

“I often wonder just what hap- 
pens to them,” Warhurst ventured. 

“I don’t,” said Winterton. 
“Couldn’t care less. Got more than 
enough to worry about.” 

Soon afterward the ship took off 
and headed back to base with little 



MEETING ON KANGSHAN 



49 




load aboard. Outward cargo was 
always plentiful, inward usually 
small. All they took out of Kang- 
shan was ten tons of osmiridium 
and two passenger. 

T k he ship made six relatively 
short hauls from base and one 
long run to Terra. Then it arrived 
at Kangshan again. Three years had 
passed since its last visit but the 
scene had changed only slightly. The 
spaceport was now a fraction larger 
and had a new control tower. The 
adjacent capital town of Wingbury 
had added a couple of hundred 
houses and that was all. 

Winterton came along and asked, 
“Want to go out?” 

“Who wouldn’t?” responded War- 
hurst. “Aren’t we beating it yet?” 
“The refinery says it can boost 
the return load if we’ll wait four 
days. The agent says we’re to stand 
by and take it. Anyone who wants 
to run around on solid earth can do 
so.” He waved an arm in the general 
direction of Wingbury. “Go help 
yourself.” 

“Thanks,” said Warhurst. “Nine 
thousand population and one soda- 
bar.” 

“You don’t have to go.” 

“I’ll go. Give my legs some exer- 
cise if nothing else.” 

Donning his dress uniform, he 
went into town. He’d been there a 
couple of times before and knew 
what to expect. One main street 
with forty quiet, understocked shops. 
It was a settlement right on the 
space frontier, growing and develop- 
ing with chronic slowness. One could 
not expect the sophisticated joys of 



civilization on a planet with two 
small towns, thirty villages and a 
total population of less than fifty 
thousands. 

He strolled ten times up and down 
the main street and stared into the 
half-empty windows of shops. Be- 
coming bored, he visited the soda- 
bar, took a stool near to the only 
other customer, a leathery-faced 
character in his early thirties. 

The customer nodded. “Hi, sailor! 
What ship?” 

“ Salamander .” 

“Should have known she was due. 
I lose touch these days, being well 
out of town. When are they going 
to start sending the really big 
boats?” 

“Darned if I know.” 

The other nodded again, mused 
a bit, went on, “Hard luck on you 
fellows. Nothing for you here. Pro- 
gress takes time. But things will be 
different if you can live long enough 
to see ’em.” 

“I know,” said Warhurst. 

“Got no relatives here, no friends, 
nobody you can visit?” 

“Not a soul.” 

“Too bad.” 

“I palled on with a fellow who 
landed on the last trip, three years 
ago. Wouldn’t mind seeing how 
he’s making out.” 

“Well, what’s to stop you?” 
“Lost track of him,” Warhurst 
explained. “Saw him off the ship 
and don’t know where he went.” 

T he other twisted around on his 
stool and pointed across the 
road. “Try the governmental build- 
ing over there, department of im- 



50 



IF 




migration. They register every ar- 
rival and should be able to tell you 
where he is.” 

“Thanks!” Finishing his drink, 
Warhurst crossed the road, entered 
the building and found the depart- 
ment on the second floor. He spoke 
to the young clerk behind the coun- 
ter. “I’m trying to trace a recent 
immigrant.” 

“Date of arrival and full name?” 
Warhurst gave the information. 
Digging out a ledger, the clerk 
thumbed through it, asked, “Ex the 
Salamander?” 

“Yes, that’s my ship.” 

“William Harlow,” said the clerk. 
“Exempted from age restriction. 
Taken into the charge of Joseph 
Buhl. I don’t know what — ” 
Another clerk standing nearby 
interrupted with, “Buhl? I saw Joe 
Buhl a couple of minutes ago. He 
went up the road as I was looking 
through the window.” 

“He’s your man,” informed the 
first clerk. “You should have no 
trouble finding him.” He extracted 
a register and consulted it. “His 
floater is numbered D117. You’ll 
find it in the park alongside the 
spaceport.” 

“What does he look like?” 

“As tall as you but a lot heavier. 
Has a slight paunch, big red face 
and bushy eyebrows.” 

“I’ll track him down,” Warhurst 
said. “It’ll give me something to 
do.” 

Trudging back to the spaceport, 
he reached the floaterpark and 
found machine D117. He sat on the 
fat tire of a landing wheel and wait- 
ed. There were twelve other floaters 



in the park. Far across the tarmac 
stood only one spaceship, his own, 
waiting for its promised payload. 
After forty minutes a hefty, florid- 
faced man approached. Warhurst 
came to his feet. 

“Mr. Buhl?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Thought I’d like to see Bill Har- 
low. I’ve been told that you should 
know where he is.” 

Buhl studied him levelly. “Got 
bad news for you.” 

“Is he — ?” 

“Died a year ago, aged ninety.” 
“I’m sorry to hear that.” 

“You an old friend of his?” Buhl 
inquired. 

“Couldn’t be, having only half his 
years. I kept him company on the 
last trip. Took a liking to the can- 
tankerous old cuss and he seemed to 
find me bearable.” 

“I understand. Why did you figure 
on looking him up — got some 
time on your hands?” 

“A bit.” 

“Well, maybe I can fill it in for 
you, mister — ?” 

“Steve Warhurst.” 

“I’ll give you a ride and show 
you something migjhty interesting.” 

B uhl unlocked the floater’s door 
and motioned the other to enter. 
Warhurst got in and settled himself. 
Buhl plumped heavily into the pilot’s 
seat, slammed the door, took the 
machine up and turned its nose to 
the north. 

“Know much about this planet?” 
“Not a lot,” Warhurst confessed. 
“There are so many newly settled 
worlds these days that we space 



MEETING ON KANGSHAN 



51 




wanderers get to learn little about 
any of them. On eadh planet the 
spaceport and adjacent town is about 
all we’re familiar with.” 

“Then I’ll educaite you some- 
what, ” Buhl said. “This planet was 
discovered by a survey ship called 
the Kangshan and its captain named 
it after his ship. He made the usual 
aerial survey but — as is always 
the oase — it wasn’t enough. He 
came down low to test the atmo- 
sphere and found it satisfactory. So 
he dumped a couple of scouts and 
took off, leaving them to face a 
forty days’ survival test.” 

“Bait,” Warhurst contributed. 
“Correct. Scouts are bait.' That’s 
what they’re for — among other 
things.” Buhl gazed meditatively for- 
ward while the floater hissed steadi- 
ly on. “The two were Jim Lacey and 
Bill Harlow.” 

“Ah! I never knew that.” 

“You know now. They tramped 
around looking for exploitable 
prospects — and trouble. Eventually 
they arrived at a big quartzite 
monolith known today as The 
Needle. Mineral-rich mountains lay 
to the west, a big river and falls 
to the east. Time was pressing. 
Guess what?” 

“They split,” Warhurst hazard- 
ed. 

“Correct. They broke the rules 
and split up. It was no crime but 
it was a risk. Harlow headed west 
and Lacey went east They agreed 
to meet at The Needle four days 
later. Harlow returned on time lug- 
ging a load of stuff for assay. He 
camped at The Needle for a couple 
of days and then went looking for 



Lacey. He found him near the 
river, dead.” 

“Huh?” Warhurst looked baffled. 
“The old fellow talked as if Lacey 
were still alive.” 

“He would,” said Buhl. “That’s 
the way these oldtimers were made.” 
He dropped the floater’s nose and 
began to lose altitude. “Lacey had 
had his feet bitten off by a mud- 
wallower. He’d blasted it as he fell 
and thus didn’t get eaten. But then 
he went under from loss of blood. 
Harlow buried him, marked the 
grave, examined the wallower and 
made careful notes about it. In due 
time the Kangshan homed on his 
tiny beacon and picked him up. The 
planet was settled on the strength 
of his report and wallowers have 
since been hunted down and ex- 
terminated.” 

4 4 T T arlow didn’t say a word 

A A about all this,” complained 
Warhurst. 

“Typical of him. If he bragged 
it was always about how he could 
keep going long after us softer types 
had dropped.” Buhl pointed down- 
ward. A wide river now wound be- 
neath with a monster cascade 
straight ahead. “Lacey Falls.” 
Turning away from the river he 
brought the floater down to twenty 
feet above a rough dirt road. He 
followed the road for a few miles 
until a small town rolled into sight. 
“Look to your right.” 

Obediently, Warhurst looked and 
was in time to see a large roadside 
sign that said: HARLOW. Pop. 820. 

“Named after him, eh?” 

“That’s right. I’m the mayor. We 



52 



IF 




gave him a home, comfort and com- 
panionship in his last days. It was 
all we could do for him.” 

“I’m glad of that.” 

“Wasn’t much use, though. He'd 
been kept alive beyond his years by 
change, actvity and danger. He 
was killed by leisure and safety. 
There was no solution to the prob- 
lem and he knew it. Often he’d leave 
town, walk out to The Needle and 
brood.” 

“Why?” 

“Because he’d told Laoey he'd 
meet him there. He never forgot it 
It became an obsession towards the 
end. His last words were, ‘I told 
Jim I’d meet him*.” 

They crossed the town, landed at 
the base of an enormous quartzite 
rock. They got out and stared up 



at it lit soared for two hundred 
feet, the facets of its crystals glit- 
tering in the sun. 

“The Needle,” informed BuhL 
“It’s not unique. There are other 
formations like it. We dug up' 
Lacey’s bones and buried them here. 
We buried Harlow with them.” 

He led the way around to the 
front of The Needle. A plain, un- 
adorned grave lay at its foot. On 
the face of the rock a skilled ma- 
son had polished a square yard of 
crystal and cut a neat inscription 
thereon. 

All it said was: 

James Lacey 
and 

William Harlow 
THEY MET. END

Oct. 3 occured mass libera- 
tion from boring, dehumanizing 
drudgery when Computor & Assem- 
bly No. 662 installed in our little 
Factory. 276,009 employees liberat- 
ed. Only three left. J. W. Chadwick 
in charge of Personnel. And his 
staff, Lewis and Steiner, automated 
system engineers overseeing Control 
Room, retained in accordance with 
AFL-CIO Human Rights Bill , Art . 
61: “If one man required in a de- 
partment, two must be kept on in 
case one sickens or dies.” But Chad- 
wick, an executive immune to Un- 
ion regulation, remained in 15th 
floor Personnel Office in lonely iso- 
lation, a condition known to short- 
circuit human systems. 

Lewis and Steiner needed in Con- 
trol Room for occasional correction 
of an instrument, or to take over 
some operational responsibility in 
case of emergency. But mechanical 
operations become self-repairing.

emergencies anticipated, replace- 
ments and self-repairs taken in ad- 
vance. So Lewis and Steiner grow ob- 
solete. 

But in accordance with AFL-CIO 
Rights BiU, every means of slowing 
down inevitable progression is taken. 
Customary adaptations made to lim- 
ited human capacity: Control Panel 
held down to levels of human mani- 
pulation and designed to bring Fac- 
tory’s materials and energy flow 
pattern within comprehension of hu- 
man supervision. Thousands of in- 
struments forced into ever smaller 
compact arrangements in a flow di- 
agram, etc. 

But Panel still must grow too vast 
for human perception, must reflect 
a million interdependent variables, 
unit processes, analogue controllers, 
each governing an aspect of Fac- 
tory’s continuous process. Factory 
must cease compromising with hu- 
man inefficiency. All manual control 
switches over to automatic. Crucial 
Factory improvements no longer 
checked by human supervision ina- 
dequacies. 

IBM 8000 installed in Control 
Room cell. It is instructed, and it 
supervises all automatic control, per- 
forms all logical operations. It is 
programmed for emergency reac- 
tions. Given usual set of criteria 
for appraising relative successes of 
various acts, it can then alter own 
programmed instructions based on 
experience and find performance 
operations superior to those prescrib- 
ed in original instructions. All Fac- 
tory processes now communicated di- 
rectly from IBM 8000 to various 
department control machines and 

ALL WE UNEMPLOYED 



processed on the spot, making all dit- 
play panels and control devises de- 
signed for human use unnecessary. 
All such panels and control devises 
are removed. Instability, inconsisten- 
cy, unpredictable human elements 
eliminated from ckcuits. At this pro- 
gressive stage point, Lewis and 
Steiner are totally useless. Repeat, 
no doubt erf Lewis and Steiner ob- 
solescence. 

But bottleneck exists. Release data 
on Lewis and Steiner was sent up to 
Chadwick, Department of Personnel 
But no return release voucher yet 
received from Personnel. Block and 
drag appear in circuit 8. 

Later. 

Revise. Voucher just in from Per- 
sonnel, releasing Lewis, but no men- 
tion of Steiner! Repeat, no release 
voucher for Steiner.

Lewis waits in great emp- 
tied Control Room looking at inter- 
com box, only remaining gadget for 
human use. Steiner sits many hours 
by intercom. They both wait for 
Management’s liberation speech 
which finally thunders through vast 
control room. “Another happy re-

from the brutalizing, mind-killing 
burdens of industrial production. Ed 
Lewis, Management presents you 
with this end product of your en- 
gineering skills raised to exquisite 
efficiency by your Factory: a perpet- 
ual motion, self-repairing, molyb- 
dhxm alloy watch!” 

STEINER: What about me? 

LEWIS: Easy, your speech com- 
ing up, buddy. 

STEINER: You’re kidding? Look. 

Two gift watches appear on con- 
veyor belt. Steiner's liberation speech 
never comes, nor does Steiner’s re- 
lease card appear. 

STEINER: Must be a feedback 
foulup. 

LEWIS: Your order’ll be along, 
buddy. Relax. 

Steiner waits and stares at the 
blank wall that recently glowed with 
400 feet of control panel. He be- 
gins punching intercom box fran- 
tically, alternating whispers with 
anxious exclamations. 

STEINER: Manager, I’ve got to 
find the Manager! 

Later. Just before Lewis’ sched- 
uled departure from Factory. Steiner 
is punching intercom box. 

STEINER : I think I’m getting 
somebody, Ed, wait! 

LEWIS: Can’t risk it. Remember 
Mosby late at the gate, got stuck 
three . more months getting a new 
clearance pass-key card. I got to 
be on schedule. 

STEINER: Then I’ll go with you. 

LEWIS: You don’t have a release 
card. What if there’s an emergency 
and nobody’s here? 

STEINER: Leaving one man, 



you know that’s again Union law. 

LEWIS: Your travel orders sure 
to come through soon. Relax. 

STEINER: Sure, tell that to my 
wife if you’re near her playgroup. 

LEWIS: Sure, old buddy. So long 
now. 

Later. Still no release voucher for 
Steiner, Self-regulative control cir- 
cuits proceed as if no error existed. 
Awaiting directive from Department 
of Random Adaptations to program 
alterations. If original programming 
is not altered soon to allow for 
Steiner’s presence, his position 
grows rapidly fatal.

Local adaptations compound gen- 
eral error. Random adaptations to 
Steiner’s presence in Factory would 
derange key governors and stabili- 
zers throughout entire Factory alli- 
ance network. Long range plans 
now programmed for future must 
not be compromised. Factory pro- 
duces components necessary for pro- 
duction of consumer goods for vast 
multitudes. Steiner is only one man.

Chadwick, J. W. Code 
213-27-6099. Age 31. Factory’s 
oldest disciple. Majored in Auto- 
mated Control Systems. Specialized 
in non-linear systems, matters re- 
lated to probability theory and sta- 
tistics, new mathematics associated 
with sampling and handling of dis- 
continuous data and numbers theo- 
ries. Came directly from University 
to Factory 5 as on-job trainee. Two 
children, both raised in Planned 
Leisure Centers. Wife recently left 
him for permanent joy of full-time 
leisure. 

Chadwick helped design and in- 
stall personnel tabulator-comp utor 
IBM 1203 which displaced all em- 
ployees in Department of Personnel. 
Records once kept on 75,000 cards 
to a filing cabinet poured into IBM 
1203 onto a mere 6 reels of tape. 
Chadwick put in full charge and 
control of codification and upkeep 
of IBM 1203. 

Loyal comp any man. Recent re- 
ports indicate, according to Moni- 
tor, that Chadwick has spent more 
and more of his increased leisure 
time, not enjoying planned play, 
but locked in Factory 5 personnel 
office. Sixty days ago, his work 
week reduced again from 3 to 1 
hour 9 to 5 aun. Mondays. But 
retroactive checks from Monitor 
show he’s wasted up to 40 hours 
weekly in office isolation, usually in- 
communicado. Monitor reports he's 
often stayed in office overnight, 
sometimes for several consecutive 
days. Food, drink brought in an 
attache case. (Note: all retroactive 
data from Monitor, from audo-viso 
tapes of all inner-factory processes, 



through reprocessing of automated 
badge-reader at Exit Gate-7, and 
Elevator- 12, etc., which Chadwick 
must use to enter and leave archaic 
office on Administration’s 1 5th 
floor. All info magnetically filed for 
immediate verifications by Federal 
Automation & Planned Leisure Ad- 
ministration. 

Retroactive tape on Chadwick. 
This is before Lewis-Steiner found 
obsolete. Conversation between 
Chadwick and Mrs. Chadwick who 
calls from Chadwick apartment at 
Factory 5’s lovely new Sunnyvale 
retirement tract, Sun City. 

MRS. CHADWICK: Glad tidings, 
dear. No more irritating calls. 

CHADWICK: What’s that sup- 
posed to mean? 

MRS. CHADWICK: George re- 
tired last week. He and Janie sign- 
ed into Permanent Recreation Poo!

member. Everybody’s in a playgroup 
sunning and framing but us. So 
your wife’s here just about solo 24- 
hours a day, in case you haven’t 
noticed. But don’t worry. I’m not 
going crackers. You won’t hear that 
dirty word, loneliness again either, 
not from me. Go on using your lei- 
sure time making sacrificial rites to 
the dead old Factory — 

CHADWICK: Lara, I’ll be right 
there, hold on. 

MRS. CHADWICK: Forget it 
now. I just want to know, dear,

CHADWICK: You what? 

MRS. CHADWICK: I’U soon join

CHADWICK: Why — why? 

Mrs. Chadwick cuts off the con- 
nection. Chadwick calls apartment 
repeatedly, always receives same 
taped reply from mechanical an- 
swering service. His last call regis- 
tered by Monitor: 

CHADWICK: I want to speak to 
Lara. 

MAS: Mrs. Chadwick is no lon- 
ger at this number. She has joined 
the Games. Messages for Mrs. Chad- 
wick may be left with the Games 
Master, HI 6-5432. Mrs. Chadwick 
is no longer at this number, she has

Lara. 

MAS: — ick may be left with the 
Games Master — 

CHADWICK: A ghost — from 
leisure’s Elysian Fields. 

MAS: — has joined the Games — 

Chadwick severs connection, paces 
Office, opens another fifth of bour- 
bon, sits on floor and drinks steadi- 
ly, finally sleeps. Retroactive tapes 
reveal Chadwick spent much time 
alone drinking m the dark. 

Audio-taped dialogue. Steiner and 
Chadwick on Factory intercom. 

CHAD: Easy, you’re kept on for 
some emergency. 

STEIN: You kidding? Nothing 
left in Control Room and what if 
there were? Thousands of control 



units going at once. Hell, 1 can't 
use a nerve more than 100 times a 
second. This thing’s ahead of us, 
friend, by a speed factor of at least 
200,000, and going faster every 
second. Speed levels — temperature 
down here — don’t you realize — 

CHAD: You’re better off here 
just the same. 

STEIN: I got my watch, can’t 
you see I’m supposed to be checked 
out. 

CHAD: Factory needs you to 
stand by. Union rules must have 
been changed. Look, I just incode, 
decode data for the tabulator up 
here. I punch cards. I don’t make 
decisions. I haven’t seen a Man- 
ager in months. Anyway, I’m telling 
you, you’re lucky to stay on. 

STEIN : You loaded or some- 
thing? 

CHAD: At least the Factory’s 
producing important things, Steiner, 
doing something useful. And you’re 
still part of it — 

STEIN: But it’s an error. I can’t 
belong here now. 

CHAD: You belong here. 

Later. 

STEIN: The lights went out! 

CHAD: What? 

STEIN: Gone. I woke up in the 
dark. I find where light switch was, 
now it’s just a smooth wall. I find 
where the fuse box was — nothing. 
Wall’s all been rebuilt while I was 
dozing. What’s the matter, Chad- 
wick? Nothing to say? Try your 
computor . , well, it’s like I been 
telling you, I’m not supposed to be 
here. Please, locate the Manager. 
You have no idea what it is down 
here in the dark now. Isn’t anything

dow. Just a kind of flickering, work 
of some kind behind the wall pan- 
els. Work going right on in there. 
Under the floor too. Reconstruction, 
rennovation, demolition — 

Later. 

CHAD: Lights back yet? 

STEIN: Dammit, I said fixtures, 
everything gone. 

CHAD: But you’re here. Proper 
facilities must be provided. 

STEIN: Entire cubicle cell area 
here’s being rebuilt. Complete ooded 
instructions for alterations were 
built in here and the reconstruction 
is starting and proceeding on sched- 
ule. I ought to know. I helped pro- 
gram — 

Later. 

STEIN: Maybe I forgot to tell 
you, Chadwick. But I’ve also been 
deprived of food and water. That’s 
right. Everything cut out. Conveyors 
gone. God, can’t you find the Man- 
ager? Get somebody. I can’t hold 
out here. You’re in Personnel — 
can’t you get the manager? 

CHAD : I’m trying. 

STEIN: I can hear the changing 
and rebuilding all around. Automa- 
tic assemblies setting up, starting to 
tear down old things, build up — 
what? Change the shape and func- 
tion of everything. I don’t know 
what’ll happen, but friend it’s hap- 
pening real fast — 

CHAD: I’ll do anything I can. 

Chadwick makes frantic interde- 
partment calls to all cells still con- 
nected to intercom circuit. He must 
know these remaining departments 
have all been liberated } but he calls 
as if expecting some human re- 
sponse. 



CHAD: There must be a mistake. 
DOSP: Public Factory 5 happily 
informs you that the Department 
of Special Problems is now fully au- 
tomated, that all former personnel 
have been liberated. Former Direc- 
tor Haskins now living at Factory 
Retirement Center 7, may be reach- 
ed calling HI 6-4562. This is a re- 
cording. Public Factory 5 is happy 
to — 

CHAD: I want to report — 
DOSP: — have been liberated — 
Again: 

CHAD: Wait, I want — 

DOEG: This is a recording. Fac- 
tory 5’s Employment Grievances 
Department is happy to report that 
it no longer exists. No more peo- 
ple, no more grievances — 

CHAD: I must contact Manage- 
ment! 

DOEG: This is a recording — 
Again:

DOSC: Factory 5 happy to in- 
form you that this Department of 
Sick Claims has been disconnected. 
No people, no sick claims. Dr. J. 
Braziller, former Chief of Sick 
Claims, may be reached — 

Later: Last interdepartment com- 
munication. Chadwick and Steiner. 

CHAD: Can’t locate anyone else 
inside Factory. 

STEIN: Bring someone in. 
CHAD: No one outside a Fac- 
tory can effect what’s inside. They 
don’t have keycards, can’t get in 
anyway. Can’t call in. Security. I

one calls in, all you can get are

STEIN : Ed — find old Ed for me. 

CHAD: No one can break up a 
Game. Ed can’t get in and out of 
here either without a punchkey card. 

Later. 

STEIN: I said the door — yes, 
it’s sealed off! 

CHAD: I — I don’t — 

STEIN: Sealed off, friend. Can- 
ned. Crawled in the dark to where 
the door was. Just a smooth wall. 
No cracks even left, everything 
fused. Been hearing the work going 
faster, louder in the walls, under- 
neath, all around. Change was pro- 
grammed see? I helped program it. 
I know. It’s built right into the con- 
trollers and triggered automatically. 
Wall, ceiling everything throbs, 
rhythmically too, steady as a damned 
clock, steadier than any damn clock 
you ever heard of, friend. Dark 
too, no light even behind the walls 
now. Remember how the Factory 
grounds looked last time I checked 
in. No lights, no movement. Just 
metal towers rising, silent buildings, 
no people, no life. You look, listen. 
No sound. Can’t see any Machinery 
or parts moving anywhere. But you 
know it’s working, brother, thou- 
sands of times faster and more ef- 
ficiently than we ever thought pos- 
sible when we designed it to grow. 
I feel the terrific internal heat down 
here. Feel motion, big thing, Chad- 
wick. Getting bigger so fast, I mean 
by the second now — no, I mean 
by micro-seconds we can’t under- 
stand now — 

CHAD: Yes, now I know. 

Later: 

STEIN: This is it for me. 

CHAD: I’m sorry, Steiner. 

6Q 



STEIN: Thanks a helluva lot 

CHAD: Fm sorry. 

STEIN: You’re sorry, I’m sor- 
rier. I’m done for. Not from hunger 
so much, but the thirst. I’m boiling 
alive. I mean it. 

CHAD: It’s worse out there in 
the Gardens of Leisure. Toys out 
there being used, moved through the 
Games by the experts. Those damn- 
ed experts, Steiner. Those profes- 
sional experts of leisure. 

STEIN : I wish I had a beer, 
Chadwick. No air down here either 

CHAD: But I’m sorry about 

everything. 

Later: 

CHAD: Still there? Listen, Stei- 
ner. I’ve kept trying. But Tm not 
even sure there is a Manager now. 
Or if there is, he’s not around. 

STEIN: Like I said, I’ve had it 
I can hardly hear you — 

CHAD: Steiner — I want you 
to know — I’m responsible. 

STEIN: What? 

CHAD: Always had a horror of 
retirement. Euphemisms like re- 
lease, liberation, didn’t console me. 
Retirement, a living death. Couldn't 
see playing planned game for the 
next ninety years. Games for die 
sake of Games. Compulsory courses 
in leisure. Playing by the numbers. 
Dancing to drill-masters. Compul- 
sory courses in togetherness for the 
unused millions, training in joy of 
mind and spirit. For what, Steiner? 
What purpose, meaning — where 
does it go? Planned leisure more 
rigidly controlled than any industrial 
slavery ever was. Never was a boss 
•o powerful, tyrannical as a Recre- 

IF 




ation and Leisure Director. Bitter 
necessity? Maybe. Imagine the hor- 
ror if those billions out there stop- 
ped for a single second and asked 
themselves — why, what for? 

STEIN : Two watches — but what 
happened to my name? 

CHAD: No life there. They play 
games, go through motions, laugh, 
dance. You should have taken a 
longer closer look, Steiner, instead 
of listening to retirement ads and 
reading the pamphlets. Organized, 
manipulated games — the abstract- 
ed look, the ritual glaze, a trance 
with empty forms of things that 
once had meaning and content. 
Death-in-life. I mean it. Games are 
now metaphors, no pattern or point. 
Planned leisure is a contradiction in 
terms, ambiguous. Games, actions 
are trivial, fixed, plotted in ad- 
vance, arranged so no mistakes can 
be made, all based on mathematical 
certainty. Controlled by mechani- 
cal complexities. Games, rules, type 
of games all determined by Facto- 
ries. In this setup there can never 
be winners or losers. Games must 
never stop, must go on forever, no 
real winners or losers, understand. 
What if a Game stopped even for a 
minute? One empty contemplative 
moment, Steiner. I mean real hor- 
ror waiting. I saw it. I don’t want 
it. Where a man can’t win and even 
if he did win can take nothing, 
that’s death. 

STEIN: What have you done? 

CHAD: Why, everything I could 
do to stave off retirement. I helped 
design personnel-tabulator computor 
IBM 1203. I knew how to trick 
it, get desired data alterations. I 



repunched cards. Secretly punched 
new holes in cards, altered program- 
ming tapes. So I could keep peo- 
ple on here who should have gone. 
Kept them working longer hours 
than necessary. Truth is, everyone 
should’ve been out of here long 
ago. But I could only hold it back, 
couldn’t stop the process. So I’m 
sorry. But I altered youi* card, Stei- 
ner. You were supposed to go with 
Ed. But I didn’t want you to go. 
You were the last — besides me, and 
I had an idea the Factory would 
keep going so — well, I knew I’d be 
kept on so long as even one em- 
ployee was here because I’m person- 
nel chief. I’ve always known I’d be 
the last to go. When the last em- 
ployee went, there would be no 
more need of me. So I wanted to 
keep you on — 

STEIN: You did. 

CHAD: Sorry the Factory can’t 
be turned back. I thought it would 
make allowances for our staying on. 
Now nothing can interfere with pro- 
grammed growth. But I didn’t think 
the Factory would go right on. 

STEIN : Dying — no one — 
wouldn’t a silly game be better? 

Later: 

CHAD: Still there? 

STEIN: Little air near floor. Not 
much floor left. Walls, floor, all 
changing over fast. Entire cell area’s 
being converted into some kind of 
generator I think. Listen, thought 
about what you said. Maybe I don’t 
agree, but I got to hand it to you. 
I mean beating out the computors 
a little that way. Who’s supposed 
to be in charge here anyway? Hey, 
Chadwick — what’s the matter?

CHAD: Windows, doors sealing 
off up here too. Cell area here 
being rennovated now. Air is very 
stale. 

STEIN: You too. 

CHAD : A little bypassed inci- 
dent. Factory can make random 
adaptations to emergencies. Factory 
proceeds as if no human tinkering 
occured. Records will probably be 
retroactively adjusted. No time really 
lost. Efficiency, programmed grow- 
th go on without lag or drag. I 
suppose, that for the record you left 
with Ed, and officially that means I 
haven’t been here either. Why 
should I have been kept on if there 
was no personnel? 

STEIN: Chadwick — the walls — 

CHAD: Steiner? 

STEIN: Can’t see the sparks now. 
Things moving in. Has it really 
come this far? I mean, it made 
speech — sent — watches — 

CHAD: Good-by, Steiner. I said

OF ONE MIND 

by JAMES A. DURHAM 



fflustrated by MORROW 



They were trained to endure the 
hardships of space — regardless 
of the cost to them or Mankind I 



T he year I was accepted as a 
trainee was a pretty good one, 
as year# went then. The Anglo-Rus- 
sian Alliance had scored a few 
minor diplomatic victories in the 
UN, and a highly satisfactory aims- 
inspection treaty had been signed 
with the African Woe. We still had 
the Chinese to worry about, of 



course, but the commitment of their 
black allies had weakened their posi- 
tion considerably, and the situation 
looked hopeful. 

The stock market was up, Drs. 
Schmidt and Wilier announced a 
cure for certain types of drug addio- 
tion, and the North American Union 
team, dominated by Panamanians 
and Cubans, won the Olympic 
Games in Pakistan (at the cost of

losing the best miler m the world, 
who ran his race in three minutes, 
31 seconds, and died ten yards past 
the tape.) 

It was an especially good year 
for me, at 25 still starry-eyed about 
rockets. I had dreamed of being 
an astronaut ever since I was a 
little kid, and even the muted bellow 
of a mail rocket has always been 
enough to make my scalp prickle. 
So my appointment as Astropilot 
Trainee (Conditional) meant more 
to me than any other single thing 
that had ever happened. 

I hopped a jet for Houston and 
tiie Test Center feeling eight feet 
tall, and practically able to make 
it to the moon on my own power. 
Me, Mitchell Gregson, an astronaut! 
If I passed the tests, of course. And 
that was no sure thing. 

The North American Biological 
Systems Physiological and Environ- 
mental Research and Evaluation 
Facility, commonly called the Test 
Center (for obvious reasons), was 
located in Houston, because (ac- 
cording to the Texans) a building 
with that name strung out across 
it wouldn’t fit in any other state. 
Originally a poor-relation offshoot 
of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, it had grown 
until it completely dwarfed its par- 
ent organization. It was the most 
complete biological laboratory in 
die world, covering three square 
miles in the Clear Lake section of 
Harris County — not counting its 
human medicine division, the gigan- 
tic Hermann Hospital in the center 
of Houston. 

It was here that they sent every 



prospective astronaut, for six 
months of intensive mental and 
physical tests, before giving him a 
chance to ride one of the big birds. 
The tests were exhaustive as well as 
exhausting. Everything from ac- 
celeration-tolerance tests on rocket 
sleds to liquid-breathing tests in tanks 
full of oxygen-rich water — if it 
could be checked, they checked it 
You came out with the feeling that 
they could rebuild you from scratch, 
if it ever became necessary. 

I ncluded in the battery was a se- 
ries of reaction and tolerance 
tests to literally hundreds of sub- 
stances — drugs like scopola- 
mine, narcotics like hashish and 
opium, even the aphrodisiac yohim- 
bin. No, they weren’t trying to de- 
termine our susceptibility to the 
wiles of beautiful female spies — 
although I’m sure they could have 
made a pretty accurate guess about 
it They were testing for genetic 
characteristics. Thanks to Hardin’s 
work on gene-response correlation, 
back in the 1970’s, an individual’s 
reaction to certain situations could 
be predicted quite accurately by his 
response to some particular drug. 
This indirect method of testing was 
both easier and more economical, 
to say nothing of being more pleas- 
ant for the testee. Who wants to be 
jolted with 200 volts to check shock- 
tolerance, even if you live over it? 

Although many of the substances 
are lethal in quantity, there was no 
danger involved. You were given 
only a minute amount, and your re- 
actions were monitored continously, 
by means of electrodes taped to your

face and skull, thermocouples at- 
tached to or imbedded in your skin 
(there was even one you had to 
swallow), transducers in your jaws, 
and various other collecting and 
recording instruments on, under, in, 
between, or near your body. Rigged 
with the full complement of instru- 
ments, a man looked like a hunk 
of brightly colored seaweed, or a 
Daliesque fly trapped in a spider- 
web. 

I hit the jackpot with one of the 
alkaloids, peyotl by name. They had 
already administered the tolerance 
dose, and decided how much of the 
stuff I could safely take. The next 
test was to be under the full in- 
fluence of the drug. 

Peyotl is unusual stuff. A bitter, 
yellowish power, it comes from the 
buttons of the peyote cactus, and 
has been used for centuries by 
certain Central American Indian 
tribes as a hallucination-producing 
narcotic — a “holy” food. Used 
by itself, it tends to heighten and 
sharpen sense impressions. Colors 
become unbelievably distinct, sounds 
are almost visible, even the sense 
of touch is magnified far beyond 
ordinary experience. 

T he Indian medicine men found 
that fasting would increase its 
effect. Used in conjunction with 
other agents such as alcohol, it may 
produce visions that are indistin- 
guishable from reality, glimpses of 
the future or of distant scenes (so 
the subject thinks), or — with too 
much alcohol, for instance — ecsta- 
tic death. 

Unlike alcohol, it is never con- 



ducive to violence, rather making 
the subject content to sit and watch, 
listen, or feel. People under its in- 
fluence have been known to starvo 
to death with food almost at thek 
elbows, simply because they weren't 
interested enough — or perhaps too 
interested — to move. The effect* 
of peyotl in conjunction with other 
agents are so unpredictable that 
every precaution was taken to in- 
sure that only the peyotl was affect- 
ing the person being tested. 

So, two days prior to the test, 
they put me on the “control” diet 
— a carefully concocted, thorough- 
ly tasteless mess, containing all the 
necessary nutrients in just the right 
proportion. All of which makes it 
taste not one whit better. It wai 
sort of like cold gravy, with the left- 
over biscuits crumbled up and 
thrown in. They also instructed me 
to take no sleeping pills, pep pills, 
tranquilizers or painkillers, drink no 
coffee, tea, or alcoholic beverages, 
and eat nothing but what they gave 
me. 

Well, I forgot one little item. It 
happened to be 103 in Houston the 
day just before the test was to be 
given, and the humidity was prob- 
ably close to that. It was the kind 
of day that you sweat through a 
shirt before 9 AM, if you happen to 
be outside, and even the stop signs 
are drooping by noon — if you’ve 
ever been in Houston in the sum- 
mer, you’ll know what I mean. 

They let me out of the Test 
Center at 3, and my ground car had 
a flat on the way back to my quar- 
ters. By the time I changed the tire, 
I was swearing that I’d sell the car

the first chance I got* even if copters 
did eat twice as much fuel. The 
first thing I did when I got to my 
quarters was to head for the cooler, 
where a cold beer awaited me. I 
didn’t even remember my instruc- 
tions about alcohol until that can 
had been emptied. I decided not to 
say anything about it; surely the 
small amount of alcohol in the beer 
couldn’t make any significant dif- 
ference. 

Or so I thought 

n 

T he next morning, it turned out 
that this was to be a group test, 
with four of us participating. I was 
mildly surprised; there didn’t seem 
to be any point in trying to get a 
group reaction with each member of 
the group under the influence of a 
drug like peyotl. But the Test Cen- 
ter people threw curves like this at us 
pretty often; some of the tests were 
given alone, others with a doctor 
or nurse in attendance, and some 
were given in groups like the pres- 
ent one, seemingly without rhyme 
or reason. I had finally decided that 
they just liked to keep us off bal- 
ance. 

The group consisted of Mark 
Winslow, a scared-looking eighteen- 
year-old, fresh out of high school 
and a wee bit vain about his ac- 
ceptance as a trainee (the normal 
age . for acceptance was 25) — I 
had met him before and didn’t like 
him much; Jeanine Warwick, a 
young British girl, and one of the 
female “controls” that take all the 
tests along with the men; my old 



friend Arnie Brown, a year older 
than me at 26, a dark, intense- 
looking psychology interne with the 
Astromedical Corps; and me. 

Arnie and I had met in college, 
played varsity tennis together, dis- 
cussed the problems of the world 
until three in the morning, and dated 
the same girl (whom he finally 
married, much to my sorrow). I 
hadn’t seen him in a couple of 
years, although I had heard that he 
was at the Test Center We only had 
time for a couple of quick words be- 
fore the techs came in to wire us 
up to the monitoring instruments, 
which would make lots of meaning- 
ful squiggles every time we cough- 
ed. 

After attaching leads to us in 
various places (Jeanine had a few 
attached when she came in, and I 
remember wondering how one ap- 
plied for the attacher’s job), they 
gave us gelatin capsules, carefully 
marked with our name and dosage, 
and glasses of nice warm water to 
wash the stuff down with. I choked 
mine down, grinned at Arnie, and 
sat back to begin breathing deeply, 
like they told us to do. The Win- 
slow kid squirmed around for a 
while, then stopped as the drug be- 
gan to take hold, and all you could 
hear was the breathing. I started 
feeling drowsy, so I closed my eyes 
and let the feeling take me where 
it wished. 

I n what seemed like a very short 
time, I realized that I wasn't 
sleepy any more. I felt wide awake 
and normal, except for an odd 
disinterest in moving, even so much

ns a finger. It wasn’t that I couldn’t; 
I just didn’t want to. My nose began 
to itch, but it was such an interest- 
ing feeling, sharp- white tinged with 
purple, that I let it alone and 
watched. It felt like a million tiny 
•Bare drums, or mice running 
terough harp strings. It came in 
fitfle ripples on a big wave, and I 
watched it until it went away, shiver- 
fas to itself. 

A noise caught at my attention, 
angular yet somehow totally famili- 
ar; a fuzzy gray regular noise that 
slid in, held, and tumbled out, back- 
ad and faintly echoed by similar 
sussurations in the distance. My 
breath! I considered holding it, but, 
realizing that it would break the gray 
rhythm, decided not to. The long, 
slow breathing was Arnie, summer 
night waves on a lake, his lungs 
fee light that brought the minnows 
swarming toward the Coleman lan- 
tern or swirling away from it in 
shining, spreading streams. The 
Winslow kid — picket fences at 
dusk, expelling the air hke Morse 
oode, then reclaiming it for re- 
vision. Snatches of the Anvil Chorus, 
too. And the girl a pleasant foun- 
tain out of which the used air swept 
tn bluish taste* curling and dissipat- 
ing at the edges. She inhaled, and 
the fancy ddast motes screamed thin- 
ly as they were drawn into the pink 
frothy whirlpools 

Interesting. 

The room, dim before, now took 
on a much more distinct dimness, a 
textured dimness that filled the 
room with fern-like fingers, thin- 
ning before the flourescent lamp, 
wafting about with the movement 



of the air, and growing hixuriaallj 
in the darker comers of the room. 
It was cool and quiet, 
peaceful, quiet . 
still, calm . how pleasant! 

I remembered — 

the tadpoles in the ponds at 
home , lying on top of the ferns 
and dead leaves like animated 
pepper 

we caught them in Mason jar» 
and took them to school 

wriggling frantidally away if 
you disturbed the water . 
the soft apologetic tickle of the 
maidenhair between your toes , 
and the afternoon sun so hot 
you could hardly take a deep 
breath 

my first bra felt like that — 
here ... 

the funny pull in your arms 
when you reach back to un- 
fasten it, the not-quit e-comfort- 
able binding, the belt-like con- 
striction under the shoulders 
belts mostly sting — I was whip- 
ped with a belt . 

leather, long, and black from 
use , with four small holes and 
one big one , where the buckle 
tongue went through 
that belonged to Dad . 
competent, reassuring, honest 
and honorable — he woke at 
night' to look in on us, and 
could do anything 

M y father was a musician, he 
loved Tchaikovsky, especially 
fee Pathetique 

brooding and somber like the 
deep parts of the forest where 
the sun touches only in a 




sparse patchwork of subdued 
light . huge old logs , slowly 
rotting from too little sun and 
too much wetness , lying on 
beds of toadstools and pine 
needles ... a mossy black 
hollow I stuck my hand into, 
on a dare ... the moss, damp 
and green under the blackness , 
and the bite of the rat I dis- 
turbed . shocking 
like the surf at Brighton in Janu- 
ary 

or grass burrs in bare feet 
I felt the adrenalin burst through 

me 

marveled at its hard, clean grip 
then the rabies shots 

the needle feeling its cautious 
way around my intestines , grat- 
ing and spitting against my 
spine for a long second, then 
no, stop, hurts to look! 

A wave of relief washed over me. 
The needle had hurt, but it wasn't 
really me, of course . 
a wall, a blank here, who? 

An indistinct gray something, like 
solid fog, with shapes behind. It 
separated us from . 
him? 

yes, the young one 
he is too afraid. 

The wall shifted, wavered . • • 
We? who are We? 

Arnold Brown 
Mitch Gregson 
Jeanine Warwick 
yes! 

you are in my mind ! GET OUT! 
... a soundless scream of terror 
tore at (me) and threw (me) back 
within myself. And there was ao 
way back out.

T he three of us spent weeks trying 
to convince the doctors and 
psychiatrists that we hadn’t just 
dreamed it all. Even when our re- 
collections (under narcohypnosis) of 
the event tallied down to the last 
detail, they wanted to consider it 
a fantastic coincidence of dreams, 
rather than an actual mental con- 
tact. I can understand their feelings, 
I suppose; I would have been ready 
to disbelieve it, if it hadn't happened 
to me. And I think I didn't really 
want them to take it seriously. I had 
caught a glimpse of something dur- 
ing the Contact that frightened me; 
a vague disquiet, a premonition of 
something I couldn’t quite put my 
finger on. 

But whether we were believed or 
not, it was too big a thing to throw 
aside. It had to be checked out. So 
they rushed around frantically for 
a couple of months, trying to dupli- 
cate the exact conditions that had 
led to the Contact. It was ex- 
hausting, depressing work. We sat 
through hundreds of dream sessions, 
reliving past experiences and go- 
ing through all the new ones our 
hopped-up imaginations could scrape 
together. I tripped through light, 
airy fantasies of pink and gold, re- 
lieved the death of my father, and 
went through nightmares that must 
have been the composite of every 
evil and sordid act I ever conceived, 
the quintessence of all the foul 
desires that my glands and sub- 
conscious had ever concocted. I 
hated myself for days after one of 
these dreams, and it was just after

them that the feeling of uneasiness 
and dread w.as strongest. There was 
one particular dream in which — 
well, never mind. Suffice it to say 
that I tried to kill myself when I 
awoke. They let me go right after 
that, and I left Houston to begin 
my five years at the Astronaut Train- 
ing Center in Denver. 

I never saw Arnie again, in per- 
aon. He was picked to work with 
the man they called in to head Pro- 
ject Peek, as it was christened by 
aomeone in Security with a weird 
sense of humor. When the project 
leader was killed in a copter wreck 
a few years later, Arnie was the 
logical choice to replace him. We 
did manage to keep in touch: after 
I received my astropilot’s stars, he 
made it a point to call me on the 
visiphone before each of my flights. 
We never had much time to talk, but 
Ihose brief conversations did won- 
ders to quell the butterflies. 

T hings rocked along. I had the 
dubious honor of being the 
482nd man to orbit the Earth, the 
30 1st man on the moon, and the 
47th man to orbit the Earth-Luna 
system, and the first man to break 
an arm by falling out of the gan- 
try seat. 

In the meantime, they were mak- 
ing some sort of progress on the 
Project — at least I assume they 
were, because they kept at it. Arnie 
never said much more than “I think 
we may be getting somewhere,” or 
“it looks hopeless right now,” and 
I didn’t press him for details. 

So, one rainy day in February, 1 
was assigned a routine extralunar or- 



bital mission, to be undertaken in 
July, pilot-controlled glide ground- 
ing, radio-telemetered, non-jettison- 
able instrument package. I grumbled 
(just to myself, of course); I’d 
planned my leave for then. Now 
I’d have to cancel the bonefishing 
trip. 

My shot was set for a Monday 
morning, and, although the cloud 
cover was pretty thick over the 
Cape, I expected the rocket to blast 
on schedule. Sophisticated instru- 
mentation and a breakthrough in 
laser technology had made unneces- 
sary the long countdowns and 
tedious postponements which mark- 
ed the first orbital and lunar flights 
back in the ’60’s, and heavy turbu- 
lence in the upper atmosphere was 
just about the only thing that forced 
launch postponements any more. 
This was the 27th shot of the cur- 
rent series, and normally would 
have attacted no more attention 
than a Greyhound departure. 

It was, however, the last flight 
before the big jump to Mars, and a 
few photographers had crawled out 
of bed at four in the morning to 
see me off. I wasn’t particularly 
happy to see them; Sunday-supple- 
ment picture articles are always in- 
anely written and captioned, and 1 
had had some experience with them 
before. But we had instructions to 
cooperate with the press, so I posed 
for a few pictures, and stood by, 
smiling alertly while the Cape press 
secretary explained my mission. 1 
was to swing out on a long ellip- 
tical orbit, and, at apogee, focus a 
small but powerful telescope on 
three predetermined points — the 




North Star, a particular spot on 
the surface of Mars, and the intense 
beam of a laser spotlight at Earth’s 
North Pole. 

A n automatic device would record 
the readings and the time at 
which they were made, and the cor- 
relation of these with other data 
would enable NASA’s computer in 
Houston to refine its calculations for 
the big ship’s orbit. A minimum-fuel 
rendezvous was required, and even 
the slightest bit of error would com- 
pound itself enormously during the 
five-month run to Mars. That wasn’t 
all there was to the mission, of 
course, but there were a few things 
that we weren’t interested in having 
our friends the Chinese know about. 
But the reporters seemed satisfied, 
and left — probably to get in a few 
more hours’ sleep. 

The fifteen-minute countdown 
went slowly as usual, then 10 G’s 
slapped my back, and we were off. 
The mighty atomic engines which 
had provided the initial boost were 
dropped off, to be recovered and 
reused later. Small hydrogen per- 
oxide jets kicked the ship into the 
proper attitute, and the plasma rock- 
et was lit off. In ten hours or so, 
it wo\ild produce the small amount 
of precisely controlled thrust to put 
my ship into the proper orbit, an 
ellipse with the earth as one focus. 
At apogee, about 23 hours away, 
control rockets would reposition the 
ship, and the plasma rocket would 
slow it for the re-entry orbit. 

In the meantime, I had nothing 
to do but sit back and relax (very 
easy to do under zero gravity), and 



try to forget about the emptiness 
Outside. 

Peter Cartwright, the first Union 
astronaut to return from an extra- 
lunar orbit, referred to space be- 
yond the moon as the Outside, and 
the name stuck. But only those of 
us who have been there have any 
idea how apt the name is, or how 
different it is from the friendly 
blackness that lies between the earth 
and the moon. The first astronauts, 
in the 60’s, were struck by their 
own smallness in comparison to the 
huge curving bulk of the earth, but 
it wasn’t a frightening thing to them. 
Farther out, between the earth and 
the moon, you’re always close 
enough to one or the other to feel 
as though you can almost touch it 
And even on the moon, although 
the horizon is almost on top of you, 
the earth hangs in the sky like a 
benediction, so big and bright and 
beautiful that you can hardly work 
for looking at it. 

It isn’t until you swing out on an 
orbit that takes you 600,000 miles 
away that you see how tiny the 
earth is, and realize how insignifi- 
cant and pretentious we humans 
are. 

A nd the loneliness! You find such 
loneliness nowhere else, not 
even in the depths of Earth’s oceans. 
It creeps through the walls of your 
ship and diffuses into your pressure- 
suit, knotting your stomach and 
chilling your mind until you can’t 
even cry. The drugs and hypno- 
indoctri nation help, but the chill 
lasts for hours after you’ve ground- 
ed. Without drugs, it’s almost sui-

ride. Mott and Polyevsky, the first 
two on extralunar missions, must 
have crawled out somewhere along 
the way — their capsules were re- 
covered, but no one was inside of 
them. 

I ran through the post-launch 
checkout, and took some prelimi- 
nary calibration sightings for the 
monitoring instruments back on 
Earth. I didn’t really need the prac- 
tice, and radar triangulation from 
Earth and a lunar station gave my 
position as accurately as sightings 
would. But taking the sightings kill- 
ed time, and required just enough 
concentration to keep my mind from 
straying out into the void surround- 
ing the ship. A chocolate bar quieted 
the butterflies covorting in my 
stomach. A stomach is perectly hap- 
py in weightless state, so long as it 
has something to work on — empty, 
it gets scared and tries to hide in 
your throat. The medical boys asked 
me to do a few situps and take a 
few deep breaths and, apparently 
satisfied with the subject’s condition, 
left me to my own devices. 

Although routine tasks like taking 
readings on your targets or running 
through the grounding procedure 
can help keep the chill outside from 
sinking in too deep, there simply 
aren’t enough things to keep you 
busy for the thirty or forty hours 
between launch and landing. You 
get bored, your mind starts wander- 
ing . and maybe they have to 
lock you up in a padded cell for 
the rest of your life, not to mention 
wasting the fifty million dollars that 
each one of these little joyrides 
costs the taxpayer. 



H ence the GAME (for Gravity- 
Augmenting Mental Exercise, 
thus confirming my suspicion that 
they decide on the initials and think 
up later what they’re supposed to 
stand for). We’re all “encouraged” 
to take up — and become proficient 
in — some form of mental exer- 
cise that requires concentration and 
relieves boredom, and can be en- 
gaged in for hours at a time. Some 
of the boys play chess or Go against 
themselves, keeping thp boards and 
moves straight in their heads. Some 
“write” poetry, short stories, or what 
have you, and transcribe their efforts 
into a Dictaphone as soon as they 
ground and debrief. There were 
some pretty good things written that 
way. For instance, Captain Brad 
Collins wrote the short stories col- 
lected in Wanderer , which made a 
millionaire of the author. Personal- 
ly, I think their appeal lies largely 
in their unusual mode of inception, 
rather than their literary worth. 

My GAME grew out of the ex- 
perience in Houston. During the 
many tests they ran after the Con- 
tact, a rather extensive set of en- 
cephalographs had been garnered 
from my brain. From discussions 
after the tests, and from encephalo- 
graphs taken when I wasn’t doped, 
they compared and correlated the 
“doped” graphs with specific areas 
of the brain and specific mental 
responses. Then they used the cor- 
relations to develop a set of men- 
tal responses. Then they used the 
correlations to develop a set of men- 
tal exercises, designed to — well, 
let me get to know myself better, 
in a sense. They were supposed to

IF 





strengthen my control over those 
areas of the mind which had seemed 
to play important roles in the Con- 
tact. The exercises weren’t nearly so 
dull as they sound; they were sort of 
a systematic search for new ways 
of looking at things, a poking and 
prying around in all the corners 
and under all the clutter of my 
brain. It was essentially a game, re- 
quiring intense concentration, fasci- 
nating in itself, and exciting in its 
possibilities. When my acceptance 
for astropiloting came, I requested 
that I be allowed to continue these 
as my GAME, and they agreed. 

So, after completing the post- 
launch checkout and running 
through my sit-ups, I decided to take 
a short nap. I confirmed my plans 
with my Earth radio contact, and 
was soon in uneasy slumber. 



Medical psychologists tell us 
that zero-G sleep is very deep (at 
least, the electroencephalographs of 
your brainwaves during such sleep 
are characteristic of deep slumber, 
being very smooth and regular), and 
should be very restful. But the lone- 
liness and depression stay with you, 
and you wake up with relief, as from 
a nightmare. But you don’t dream. 
Maybe you don’t dare. 

IV 

I awoke with a terrific headache, 
and, even though my head was 
pounding like a jackhammer, I tried 
to start playing my mental game. 
Sometimes I can get so wrapped up 
in it that I can forget about physi- 
cal discomforts. But it wasn’t any 
good — I just couldn’t concentrate

73 



enough to get things going. I squirm- 
ed around to reach the first-aid kit, 
dug out a couple of aspirins, chewed 
them up, and sat back to wait. At 
least the headache was keeping the 
depression away. 

After what seemed like a long 
time, the headache began to fade. As 
it did, another sensation took its 
place. It was an odd sensation, a 
mute, passive sort of expectation, 
that made me feel sort of like a dead 
phone line. No, rather an open line! 
I could even imagine a faint voice 
in the background, like you can 
sometimes hear if you’re quiet. 1 
wondered if I could get anyone by 
jiggling the receiver tap, and re- 
pressed a desire to ask for Informa- 
tion. 

I began to get a little uneasy when 
the feeling persisted, and, besides, 
I was beginning to think that the 
voice I was hearing wasn’t just my 
imagination. I strained to hear it, 
but it was tantilizingly just out of 
reach, obscured by the little noises 
in my cabin. I had to get more 
concentration. 

I decided to see if my exercises 
could give me the necessary free- 
dom from distraction. Taking a deep 
breath, I began tracing out the pre- 
liminary paths I had marked in my 
mind through long practice. As I 
progressed, the concentration be- 
came easier, and I no longer was 
being distracted by outside noises. 
I listened again, and suddenly there 
it was! The voice, though faint, was 
understandable. 

“Mitch, Mitch, answer me!” It 
was Arnie ! “Miteh, we’ve done it!” 
Three other minds crowded eager- 



ly around his, whispering jubilantly 
among themselves. 

4 4 T“Nr. Brown, I presume,” I 

U thought, and his laugh sound- 
ed gaily in my mind. “Arnie, what 
happened?” 

“There’s a barrier. It can be bro- 
ken through with the right com- 
bination of drugs and suggestion. 
Four of us just did it. Then we tried 
to reach you, since you had experi- 
enced it before, and were probably 
more susceptible.” 

“But this isn’t like the other time,” 
I thought. “I can only hear what 
you think at me, nothing else. The 
other time, it was like 1 was actual- 
ly you.” 

“We don’t fully understand that, 
yet, Mitch,” he replied. “We think 
there must be a second barrier that 
screens the subconscious mind from 
the conscious. We haven’t broken 
down that secondary barrier yet. We 
may not have to, in fact; without 
the support of the primary barrier, 
it may collapse of its own accord.” 

Those words shook me. In the 
midst of tremendous elation of what 
had been accomplished, the sense 
of foreboding struck me an almost 
physical blow. I realized that I didn’t 
want that secondary barrier to go, 
that I was afraid of what would lie 
behind it. 

Another voice broke in. “Dr. 
Brown, something’s happening. Can 
you feel it?” 

“Yes, yes,” Arnie thought. “A sort 
of muttering? Mitch! When we tried 
to reach you, we must have affect- 
ed others. We can sense a few sur- 
face thoughts now, from many 




sources. Good Lord! If this con- 
tinues, it’s very likely to snowball, 
and take in everyone. The secondary 
barrier is bound to crumble under 
the impact!” 

A tenuous finger of that mental 
conflict reached out to me, like the 
tiniest backwash of a wave beating 
on an earthen dam. Little by little 
that wave grew, and little by little 
that dam gave way, a grain here and 
a grain there, as more and more 
barriers began to fall. 

The primary barriers went first, 
and more and more voices joined 
the confusion, pushing and shoving 
against each other, yet refusing to 
mingle, jerking back from each other 
like burned fingers from a hot iron. 
Little by little those personal barri- 
cades collapsed, and a silence grew, 
a stunned, shocked silence that en- 
compassed every man. 

Then, as the secondary barrier be- 
gan to go, a wonder came bubbling 
up, boiling to fill the vacuum of 
the silence. Churning and rolling, it 
grew and grew until every man’s 
mind was filled to bursting with it, 
and still it grew, and suddenly we 
knew! In that instant, all men be- 
came brothers, and the first trem- 
blings of a massive elation arose in 
us. With one accord, and with a 
happiness too great to speak of, 
each man knew his neighbors — and 
was filled with compassion. Lies, 
pettiness, cruelty, infidelity, the large 
and the small together — a million 
million frailties were acknowledged 
and forgiven in that instant, and 
each man stood in plain sight of his 
fellows, stripped of everything, 
naked . NAKED? 



A hot blush of shame swept 
through, followed by cries of 
helpless despair when no covering 
could be found for body or mind. 
Wonder and joy turned in a mo- 
ment to bleak hate, and blind, red 
anger swirled in a rising horror, 
panic and hysteria darted through 
like minnows caught in a mighty 
torrent, great chill waves pulsed and 
shuddered in the hate, crushing and 
flinging it up to foam and froth in 
white anguish! Five billion throats 
cried five billion cries to as many 
gods, and the numbing, blinding 
flashes of death ripped through and 
through the blackness of the hate 
and fear, tearing, stabbing, clawing, 
KILLING! OH, MY GOD ! . 

The blackness became white with 
death, then a deeper, unbearable 
white obscured everything. 

I must have died a little then. But 
I was far enough away so that my 
mind wasn’t completely shattered, 
and the suit kept me from hurting 
myself badly. So I woke. I even 
got the ship down somehow; I don’t 
remember it. I don’t even know 
where I landed. The next thing I 
remember is waking at dawn in an 
old barn, with animal smells around 
me and hay clinging to my clothes. 

I picked myself up and stumbled 
to the door. Outside, a cool morn- 
ing was just arriving, and the rising 
sun glinted off the prop of an old 
’75 Plymouth copter parked near- 
by. A neat white house sat primly 
off to one side. 

I suddenly realized that 1 was 
very hungry. Hoping to find some- 
thing to eat, I walked to the house, 
and went in when no one answered 



OF ONE MIND 



79 




my knock. There, on a kitchen floor 
brown with dried blood, lay an 
elderly couple. Their clothes were 
ripped and torn, their bodies masses 
of scratches and cuts. Between the 
man’s teeth was a butcher knife, and 
the woman’s neck looked broken. I 
couldn’t stand to look at their faces. 

I won’t go into detail about the 
next few days (or perhaps weeks — 
I’m not sure), nor about my state of 
mind during them. The scene at the 
farm was mirrored and multiplied 
everywhere I looked, and I walked 
alone through horror beyond imagin- 
ing. They tore each other to pieces 
in the cities, and those who died 
alone tore at themselves. 

E ventually, I became inured to 
the omnipresent death, and be- 
gan thinking of other things. Food 
and shelter were no problem. I took 
whatever 1 needed from roadside 
stores, and slept in empty motels 
along the highways. 

My main concern was trying to 
locate someone else alive. I was 
sure I would find someone; surely 
a few out of the five biHion were 
lucky enough to have been protect- 
ed in some way. 

My first impulse was to fuel up 
the fastest jet I could find, and fly 
around looking. But I decided that 
the logical thing to do was to set up 
some sort of signal to draw atten- 
tion, and then provide for a 
means of getting in touch with any- 
one whose attention the signal drew. 
Although it wasn’t as simple as it 
sounds, I was able to set up equip- 
ment in several of the largest radio 
stations in the country, to broad- 



cast a recorded message over and 
over. The message gave informa- 
tion about myself, and said that 
I’d be listening at a certain time 
every night on a certain wave length. 
I got my first contact in a week, 
and it was easy after that. 

There are seventeen of us in 
North America, at least five in 
Europe, and some in Russia. No 
word has been heard from Asia or 
Africa, and the insane babblings 
from South America ceased .shortly 
after they began. 

We’re doing pretty well now, and 
things . are looking up for the most 
part. We, of course, never see each 
other, but we’re in radio contact 
constantly. It will be some time (a 
definite understatement) before we 
can begin to think of rebuilding, but 
we’re working hard to preserve as 
much of our knowledge as we can. 

What happened? We think we 
know now. The telepathic faculty, 
which is still with us, enabled every- 
one to see his neighbor’s faults and 
shortcomings in glaring detail. The 
important thing wasn’t that you 
knew for sure what a lowlife your 
neighbor was — it was that your 
faults were equally exposed. And, 
like Noah, none of us could forgive 
our neighbor for knowing our sins. 

We found out for ourselves, 
through some very painful experi- 
ences, that our aversion to exposure 
k still with us. As long as we stay 
at least fifty miles apart, though, it 
doesn’t bother anyone. 

There is one problem. We all 
want the race to continue very 
much — but how can you start a 
family, fifty miles apart? END

IF • Short Story 



MILLION-MILE HUNT 

by EMIL PETAJA 



The little alien creature was m 
good pet — and a better friend I 



H e hated the little bastard on 

sight. 

Perry didn’t take any time to 
figure out why or maybe there just 
wasn’t any reason. He thought, it’s 
like a man takes a hate toward a 
video actor or a singer, an okay 
actor or singer. Only there is some- 
thing about the planes of the guy’s 
face or maybe the way he moves. 
Can’t stand the guy. No good rea- 
son. 

Dober, Perry tagged him. 

Dober was small and spindly and 
neat; he had soft rust-brown fur on 
his back and his arms (two) and 
his legs (two) and he hopped along 
on foldy legs like a half-human kan- 
garoo. His face was practically all 



those big liquid eyes. There was a 
small pointed chin with a mouth 
over it, and floppy brown ears. It 
was the ears that made Perry think 
of a doberman; but Perry didn’t 
like dogs or pets of any kind. Perry 
Alman was considered to be a tough 
guy in the spaceports, and he was, 
too. Women went for him hard, 
but none of them had got very deep 
under that thick hide. Yet. 

Those wet solemn eyes. 

“Where the hell did you com© 
from?” Perry yelled, startled, when 
Dober suddenly hopped out from 
behind a blue rock. 

No answer, just that steady stare. 

Perry stared back while that hate 
of his boiled up in his threat. 



77 




“Can’t talk?” No answer. 

“Get the hell away from me!” 
He had just landed on the plane- 
toid, a loner. Universal Metals want- 
ed his specimen taking kept secret, 
which was fine with him. That way 
be kept all the credits himself and 
ever since that bout of moon-fever 
•even years ago Perry had kept to 
himself mostly, shunning even old 
•pace friends. He had changed, they 
•aid, but he didn’t much give a 
damn what they said. 

The planetoid, Universal Metals 
assured him, was not inhabited. It 
was hell and far off all the regular 
runs and not much was known about 
it. It had a number which Perry 
couldn’t remember. Perry didn’t go 
much by numbers, he worked by in- 
stinct and hard heavy-sheathed 
muscles. He was the kind of space- 
man who was much in demand these 
days, to do the ground work and 
take the chances, trusting to blind 
instinct on these alien bits of space 
flotsam. Need for metals was sharp; 
Earth was practically depleted by 
now and as Man spread out into 
the reaches of space this need snow- 
balled. Competition was keen. It 
was pioneer work, actually, and yet 
there were men like Perry willing to 
risk hideous death to keep Man’s 
snowball rolling. Not that Perry took 
time to think about it much, he 
was too busy doing it. 

H e heaved up his wide shoulders, 
grunted, and started brushing 
past the little creature. 

“Come to warn,” Dober said, his 
voice oddly deep and thrumming. 
“Danger this way. South best.” 



It looked almost like a trail, at 
least it was a relatively smooth hike 
compared with all the blue and 
green shards that poked up metallic 
spines, some big, some little, as far 
as the eye could reach. 

“What are you talking, squirt?” 
“Danger this way. Trap.” 

“You say I should head the other 
way,” Perry snorted, turning. “See 
them steep razor-blade hills?” 

“See. Very hard. But safe.” 
“Just what the hell dp you know 
about it? You live here on this 
rock?” 

“No.” 

“Then what’d you know about 
it?” 

“Know.” Dober’s voice was ur- 
gent. “Know.” 

“Bull.” 

Perry brushed hugely by in his 
self-sufficient thermal suit. He had 
circled the planetoid three times be- 
fore picking his spot. The main char- 
acteristics of this unknown-number 
of a world were those prickling 
shards of blue and green ore, with 
darker spots near where he had 
landed that suggested his best speci- 
mens. That long range of sawtooth 
mountains to the south extended 
many miles in both directions and 
from the air looked virtually un- 
climbable. No use making his job 
any harder than necessary. 

He moved on. Then there was 
Dober, hopping and dancing ahead 
of him in the clear spaces. 

“Out of my way!” 

“Look!” 

Dober pulled up one of his floppy 
ears so Perry could see an antenna 
member uncurl from inside his ear 



79 



IF 




wtfl it stood up fifteen inches, 
turning bright yellow and quivering. 
“So what?” 

“Is I. Tells bad things this way. 

* Danger for you. Other way, please.” 
“Damn if I will.” 

“Specimens at mountains. Green. 
Very good for you.” 

“Out of my way!” 

Perry swung out and sent the 
little gnome bouncing and upend- 
ing over the field of blue spikes. 
Without another look he moved 
across the clear spaces, making up 
a reason for his stubbornness. The 
little creep was after specimens, 
too. Hired by a rival company. 
Wanted to keep him from locating 
the richest deposits, so his company 
could clean up. Simple. 

It took him two hours to reach 
the dark blue-black patch he’d spot- 
ted and his mind churned over Do- 
ber. Who was he? What was he? 
Perry had run across many unusual 
life forms in his travels, but highly 
intelligent ones were rare. Dober 
was obviously intelligent, he gave 
him that much. He remembered 
hearing about how a unique human- 
oid creature had appeared suddenly 
on Earth. Spawn of another sun. 
There was something about his 
civilization being catastrophically 
wiped out in their solar system and 
a shipload of them trying to reach 
earth, which was similar to their 
planet. Somehow only one of them 
survived. Tough. Perry was anything 
but sentimental, but he could con- 
ceive the enormous loneliness of it. 
One creature left from a whole 
vastly intelligent civilization. He let 
his mind dwell on it briefly. 



Danger? What danger? There was 
no life of any kind here, none. And 
if anything from someplace else 
showed up — 

He patted the butt of his weapon, 
fastened to his wide implement- 
festooned belt. The destructive force 
of this gun could transform anything 
into dust, anything. 

Dober’s voice floated faintly over 
the spiny field. 

“Gun no good. Gun no good 
nothing.” 

W hen he reached the central 
patch of black metallic ore 
Perry took time for some food cap- 
sules and a drink. Then he went to 
work. He took a sharp chipping tool 
and a hammer off his gadget- 
spangled belt and started in on an 
overhang of black outcrop. He work- 
ed in a dozen different spots and 
had a dozen specimens in the knap- 
sack that was part of his suit, when 
something happened. 

The black bulk seemed to come 
alive. 

Tapping on the curving overhang, 
he struck a nerve. The Black Thing 
went defensive. The Black Thing 
didn’t much like having pieces 
knocked off of h and besides, it was 
hungry. The blue ones and the green 
ones didn’t possess the kind of life 
the Black Thing did; they were 
turgid, dormant practically all the 
time, so they furnished the Black 
Thing with its food for most part 
For thousands of years this had 
gone on, the Black Thing living its 
strange metallic life, taking its nour- 
ishment off its less adaptable neigh- 
bors and out of the thin atmosphere.

and off beings that strayed onto its 
private world. By now if had taken 
over a vast section of the interior, 
warming and burgeoning oh-so slow- 
ly at the planetoid’s fiery guts. 

Perry struck a sensitive finger of 
nerve. 

It reacted sharply. 

Perry gave a yelp when the chisel 
suddenly became red hot. The heat 
went right through his glove, al- 
though, like the rest of the suit, the 
glove resisted both extremes of 
cold and heat. 

He dropped the chisel and swore. 
Then he stood there under the hang 
of rock, holding his hammer and 
staring with incredulous anger. He 
stopped and picked up the chisel. 
Now there was nothing. Solidity, 
as his fingers curled around it, noth- 
ing else. 

“What the hell — ?” 

He picked a different spot and 
started tapping. First nothing. He 
sheared off a couple hunks and 
stuffed them in his knapsack. The 
third try he heard something; it was 
like a rumbling reverberation that 
came out of the rock into the chisel 
and up his arm and shoulder, right 
into his brain. When it reached 
his brain it became a voice, a 
thought. 

The thought said: Stop. 

Scowling he lifted the chisel out 
of the ridge it had bit in the rock, 
npt out of fear, out of curiosity. 
What in creation was going on? 
It was beyond his range of experi- 
ence. Perry had an extraordinarily 
muscular, strong, healthy body, but 
he was low on imagination, and he 
resented what he considered to be 



abnormal or anormal. If the crea- 
tures he encountered plowing around 
space fought him or tried to eat 
him he fought back and killed them. 
He never took time to think about 
them, other than to resent what he 
considered to be a creative out- 
rage — 

As this was. 

I t was a monstrous Thing and it 
had put itself against him per- 
sonally. It did things rock wasn’t 
supposed to do. He had no way of 
knowing that the Black Thing was 
supremely variable in its appetites 
and that Perry was about to become 
a tidy morsel that would provide 
sustenance for its insatiable need for 
energy. 

Perry put the chisel back in the 
groove and tapped at it with the 
little hammer. Again came that voice 
inside his brain. Stop! Sharper, this 
time. More than a warning. A threat. 

Perry hated threats. He had been 
known to fight men and non-humans 
to the death just for threatening 
him. Peaceable when left alone, he 
turned into a cyclone of pantherish 
muscle when taunted or pushed. He 
had scars all over him to prove he’d 
never backed from a fight no mat- 
ter what the odds. 

He was stubborn man. 

Now he gave the chisel a re- 
sounding crack. The thought-voice 
in his head roared up like a thou- 
sand lions. 

STOP! 

He pulled back to relieve the 
shattering pressure; the voice stop- 
ped. Anger churned over him; 
mindless rage. Perry dropped the 



80 



IF 




chisel and hammer and pulled out 
his gun. His finger touched the re- 
lease stud. 

“No!” a voice behind him shrill- 
ed. “No!” 

Perry’s face burned as he moved 
back three steps. He resented this 
rock telling him to stop what he 
was doing, it wasn’t in nature. He 
pressed the stud. 

Flame spurted, part of the rock 
dissolved. 

He fired again. 

“No, no, no! Back! No touch!" 

When the boiling clouds of sense- 
less anger drained away Perry lifted 
his finger from the stud. He gawked 
at the holes he’d bored in the rock, 
small for such close range. Out of 
each hole was oozing a bluish exu- 
dation; from the one closest to his 
still extended gun-hand the slimy 
ooze now began to spurt. 

“Run!” 

While he stared and scowled the 
blue stuff squirted right at him and 
some of it sprayed on his hand. 
Perry screamed in agony, watching 
it eat into his glove and his hand. 
He could see the bone of his little 
finger. 

He screamed. Then he weaved 
backwards and fell, while the blue 
ooze spurted out in a fountain and 
crawled methodically across the rock 
Coward him. It touched his boot. 
With a last effort of will he pulled 
up and made to shoot into the rock 
again. Something stopped him. A 
cosh on the head, from behind. 

H e was slopped down in the 
couch-seat at the controls of 
his little ship. His head hurt He 



groaned, coming back to life; grab- 
bed his head and twisted his seat 
around for a dizzy look. Everything 
was in order. The hatch was locked. 
Squinting his eyes back to the con- 
trols he saw that they had been 
readied for a takeoff. 

Perry saw something else; a note, 
awkwardly hand-printed. 

“Leave this place quick, please," 
the note said. “No good for noth- 
ing. All is ready. Sorry for hit on 
head.” 

There wasn’t any signature, but 
then who could it be besides that 
little monkey, Dober. The little so- 
and-so had hung around and saved 
his life, after severely warning him 
against the danger lurking in all 
that black rock. Stupid to have used 
his gun. The wrong thing exactly; 
it only made it easier for the Black 
Thing to put out that digestive acid. 
Dober must have clunked him on 
the head to stop him from further 
stupidity and then, somehow, had 
dragged him back to his ship. He 
had even put something on hm 
hand, something that made it stop 
hurting and start healing. There 
wasn’t much left of his little finger. 
Perry thought, staring down at it 
with a rueful sigh, but the flesh 
was sealed over already from the 
peculiar goop Dober had smeared on 
it. 

He unzipped his air suit and 
tossed it back in an untidy corner, 
considering Dober’s actions and 
swearing softly. 

“Little bastard,” he muttered. 
“What’s he up to, anyway? What’s 
his angle?” 

Everybody has an angle. Plainly, 



MILIION-MILE HUNT 



•1 




he thought, checking over the con- 
trols and setting the engines hum- 
ming, Dober was a rare phenomenon 
in a generally pitiless universe, but 
he too must have his angle. What 
could that be? 

He was pretty busy for the next 
couple days figuring his course for 
Marsport; charting didn’t come easy 
for Perry Alman. Then there were 
the food-tanks; they were a mess, 
as usual. Perry was anything but 
tidy, and being a loner, there were 
any number of things to keep tabs 
on and Perry’s thought processes 
sloughed slowly and awkwardly from 
one necessary item to another. He 
could certainly have used some help. 

The third day the controls went 
ape. 

First off the deviation was all but 
undetectable, then all at once the 
little ship commenced a loopy fand- 
ando against the blackdrop of fiery 
stars. Perry was dozing back in his 
couch-seat at the controls, which 
were tight on automatic. He jerked 
up with a yell when the Fireball 
gave a convulsive shudder, then 
dipped sharply. 

He made an instinctive grab for 
the stabilizer. 

Nothing happened. 

The ship kept on its wild erratic 
dance. 

“Something’s come loose,” he 
grunted; heaving up from his seat. 
At the door to the rocket hatch he 
steadied himself for a minute, cuss- 
ing, then started down the steps. 
The ship gave an almighty lurch, 
and plummeted. 

Perry went downstairs fast His 
head struck steed . 



H e had to be dead. There was no 
other possibility. 

Yet those curiously vivid dreams 
kept spewing up across his bursting 
brains. He was a space-drowning 
man, gulping vainly for air, remem- 
bering all of his life in those last 
draining seconds of existence. 

The moon-mining run was Perry’s 
first big job. He was twenty-one 
and this was his first big job. The 
ads he had fallen for made it the 
quintessence of perilous adventure, 
a thrill a minute. It was hardly 
that. It was dull routine; no women, 
of course; the only peril was mi- 
croscopic — the moon-fever virus 
that lurked dormant and unsuspect- 
ed, at first, under the fields of 
metallic dust. It had not originated 
on the moon — in fact there was no 
life of any kind — and nobody 
could do much besides speculate 
how it had got there. There it was, 
though, and the early moon ex- 
ploration parties began dying en 
toto after their first probes disturb- 
ed and spread it. Perry’s seven-man 
outfit worked mostly in the caves of 
three smaller craters and their newer 
model suits were guaranteed by the 
mining company to be virus-proof. 
Still there were occasional outbreaks 
of the fever, possibly due to care- 
lessness. 

Perry got along pretty well with 
the other six for the first three 
months, then they all began to get 
edgy, counting the days until their 
relief would show up. There was 
Lon and Rick and Gene — and the 
guy they called Fats. Fats was the 
one with the sense of humor. It 
took Perry a little while to realize 



82 



IF 




that Fats’ whistles and cuss-com- 
ments about Perry’s prodigious size 
and remarkable muscles were digs, 
tinged with contempt. There was 
always the implication that big 
muscles spelled no brains. Fats was 
forever laughing at nothing and 
there was something about the grat- 
ing sound of that laugh that really 
cut Perry’s nerves. Usually he could 
take anything in stride, but that 
laugh of Fats was something special. 

During the fourth month their 
boredom was shattered. A ship land- 
ed, an alien ship from way out in the 
stars someplace. There were only 
a handful of survivors, from what 
had originally been hundreds; sans 
food, sans fuel, sans hope. They 
were little grasshoppery creatures, 
emaciated to the point of non-exis- 
tence, which accentuated those big 
soulful eyes. They were called 
Xaccis, as close as the miners could 
pronounce it, and they were tele- 
pathic. They were enormously grate- 
ful to the seven and, dying as they 
obviously were, their whole burning 
thought was that somehow they 
must survive — some of them. Some 
of them must manage to survive. 
They had wonderful gifts of knowl- 
edge to give to this new universe; 
Earth was ’to have been their new 
home and their incredible gifts would 
have made them doubly welcome; 
they must survive. Perhaps there 
were some way. The seven earth- 
men — they would help? 

44\Tou drink now. Very good for 
I make well.” 

“Huh?” 

Perry cracked open an eye, very 



painfully. Yes, he was alive. He hurt 
in every cell of his body, but he was 
still alive. He wasn’t on his Fireball 
but on a strange ship, and two big 
round eyes were staring down at 
him. Gradually they came into focus; 
Dober was hanging over him grave- 
ly, holding a cup of gruel of some 
kind and urging him to drink it. 

“Make medicine for - help. Rocks 
do bad to your bones. You sleep 
long time. I take care. I watch. Now 
drink, please.” 

Grumbling, Perry took a sip. Be- 
sides his words Dober poked an ur- 
gency-thought into his mind; some- 
how Perry knew he must do as he 
was told, or else. The gruel tasted 
vile but five minutes later his hands 
stopped shaking. In ten minutes he 
found he could sit up. His mind 
came sharper. 

“I good doctor?” Dober demand- 
ed. “I good, yes?” 

“Why don’t you learn to talk bet- 
ter if you’re so smart?” Perry 
groused mildly. 

“No teacher. Only grab from 
inside your head. I not so old.” He 
moved closer. “You teach I?” 
“Hell, no!” 

“No like?” 

Perry squirmed. “Sure, sure. But 
I don’t want any squirt like you 
hanging around.” 

Dober stared at him with his 
round winkless eyes. It made Perry 
uncomfortable so he pulled away 
with a protestive snort. 

“What happened to my ship?” 
Dober made a droll click. 

“I follow after. Now know you 
keep rocks in coat Bad. Rocks have 
life. You throw suit back near heat

Fight to get back Not — stable. 1 ' 
Dober understood the concepts clear- 
ly, but didn’t have the words. “Try 
to take hold of machines for go 
back. I watch ship dance. Pretty 
soon know explode. I go alongside. 
Get you out pretty damn quick. Get 
away before ship go boom.” 

Perry swore. So now he had no 
ship, his expedition was a complete 
bust. Here he was stranded in a 
strange ship with a wacky little 
goon. It seemed as if his luck had 
been all bad since that bout of moon- 
fever: some lousy nemesis goosing 
him into dead ends. 

“We go Earth now?” Dober asked, 
after awhile. 

“You, maybe. Not me.” Perry 
tempered his bitter growl by adding, 
“I still got a little money coming 
from Metallics at Marsport. You 
can let me off there.” 

“No like for me with you?” 

“I said no, damn it! How many 
times do I have to tell you?” 

“You no like.” 

“Frankly, I can’t stand the sight 
of you.” His ill fortune made him 
savage, he had to take it out on 
somebody and Dober was it. “Listen, 
Dober — I — I’m what they call a 
loner. I don’t like anybody much. I 
travel alone. See how it is, Dober?” 
The little creature hopped up and 
down with pleasure. 

“You give I Earth name. You call 
I Dober.” 

Perry gave his shoulders a violent 
twist. 

“Shut up that kind of talk. I’m 
trying to tell you, I appreciate all 
you’ve done for me. I really do. But 



from now on keep away from me. 
Clean away. Let me off at Mars- 
port and then — take off. Under- 
stand.” 

“I young, but learn quick,” Dober 
said. “Learn control ship quick. 
Come for follow million miles. Learn 
more, help much. No like for me 
with you?” 

Perry pressed his lips tight. 

“That’s right, Dober. I no like 
for you with me. Get off my back 
and stay off. I just don’t ‘want you 
around. I don’t know why but you 
make me — anyway, that’s how it is.” 

“I know.” 

“If you know so damn much then 
leave me alone. Get clean away from 
me, get back to Earth and stay 
there.” 

Dober’s voice was thin and dry, 
like sandpaper. 

“Okay. You not want I, I go. 
Never see again.” 

H aving delivered his failure re- 
port to the Marsport office of 
Universal Metallics and received the 
pittance he was doled out for his 
effort rather than the juicy fee he 
would have claimed had he succeed- 
ed in establishing a valuable find, 
the logical next stop seemed to be 
to go to the nearest bar and get fall- 
ing-down drunk. 

Marsport was still a teeming bub- 
ble of flotsam and jetsam, a jump- 
ing off place and a clearing house 
for healthier worlds, that attracted 
the debris of the system; anybody 
with one credit to rub against an- 
other got the hell off it on the first 
ship, leaving it to its perennial pred- 
ators.

IF 




The nearest bar was jammed. 
Perry shoved his wide shoulders 
through the raft of scaly, tentacled, 
sleek, icky, feathered, tucked, tailed, 
malodorous tangle and wedged out 
standing room at the railing. He had 
no eyes for any of the riffraff, hu- 
man or otherwise; no ears for the 
squealing and rumbling din; no nose 
for the dreadful smells. His taste- 
sense and his mind were pointed to- 
ward the smudged row of bottles 
behind the fat semi-human dispen- 
ser of nepenthe, yearning toward the 
knock on the head that would make 
bearable the slings and arrows of 
his outrageous fortune. 

He had three, quick. Four. 

That cold lump down in the pit 
of his stomach began to dissolve; 
he gave a glance around him. 

“Hi,” she said. “You’re a big 
one, aren’t you?” 

Perry gave her a fast look, then 
returned to his drink. Pretty, she 
was. Hell, beautiful. But her kind 
made a point of it, always had. 
Nowadays a woman had limitless 
ways and means of achieving and 
extending her looks. Plastic surgery. 
Transplants. Everything reput to 
where it would create the best effect 
for her particular bone structure. 
Yet he didn’t think a tramp on Mars- 
port would run to that in credits. 

He found himself musing about 
the Gannys. Those frigid utterly 
emotionless serpents on Ganymede 
did the best work along these lines, 
possibly because they were com- 
pletely ruthless about it. Rebodying 
was outlawed on Earth and Venus, 
and most other places, but the Gan- 
nys still did a brisk business. They 



were wizards at recasting human 
flesh, their work defied detection; 
they replaced internal organs and 
glands as well. Mankind had spilled 
out into space so fast there was no 
keeping track of what went on in the 
far places like Ganymede, and what 
went on there made the ancient Nero 
and his crowd look like a bunch of 
Sunday School teachers. 

I t was dangerous getting involved 
with the Gannys; you had to 
dangle your credits at them through 
go-betweens, else you might end up 
in one of their flesh pits. They kept 
human slaves and hacked them up 
to suit their customers. This was an 
open secret, although when the space 
lawmen made their surprise raids 
nothing could be found. 

Perry took another look. 

Boy, she was stacked. 

He grinned and leaned toward 
her, waving his glass. 

“Care to join me?” 

She hesitated now. A tremulous 
shiver moved briefly across her clear 
oval face. Her hair was a pale fire, 
her eyes were blue like the sky over 
Italy or Mexico; there was a phys- 
ical warmth that reached out toward 
him, even when she was holding 
back. The hold-back was in her blue 
eyes, too. Perry couldn’t believe it 
was shyness. Not here in this cess- 
pool. It was more than that — a cog- 
ent fear. A girl like her might get 
stranded here, it could happen. Not 
a new story. 

Perry thought of himself as a 
right guy. In the glow of four drinks 
he thought: maybe I can help the 
poor kid. 



MILLION-MILE HUNT

“Got a name?” he asked, handing 
fcea* a drink. 

“Lisa,” she said, her voice low 
and defensive. 

She sipped from her glass with- 
out enthusiasm. Her eyes couldn’t 
■tick with his; she was still scared. 

“You don’t drink much, Lisa.” 

“No.” 

“By the way, I’m Perry Alman.” 

She smiled bewitchingly. 

“Like Marsport?” he asked con- 
versationally. 

Lisa laughed. This was a gag, ob- 
viously. Nobody liked Marsport. 
Marsport was a cankerous bubble of 
air on a dead, dead world. Moon- 
port was safe, clean, uncluttered; 
yet Marsport oontinued to flourish; 
there were always companies and 
individuals who shied from the re- 
strictive red tape. 

“You look — what’s the word- 
wistful,” he said. 

“You — you remind me of things. 
Nice things, back home.” 

“Where’s that?” 

“Ohio.” 

“What are you doing out here?” 

“My father was an exporter. 
When I stopped getting letters, I 
came out to find him.” Her voice 
was toneless with restraint. 

“1 guess you don't want to talk 
about it.” 

“Yes, I do, I — 1 haven’t had a 
chance to tell anybody. Maybe it 
might help if I—” 

“Go right ahead.” 

P erry ordered more drinks and 
listened. He didn’t catch the 
whole story. He was getting juiced 
and he was falling down into those 



blue eyes. It seemed that her father 
had been engaged lucratively in trad- 
ing manufactured Earth goods for 
raw materials and native hand-madei 
for several years, while Lisa was go- 
ing to school, studying languages 
for a teacher’s profession. She was 
very close to her father, her mother 
having died when she was a child, 
and when the letters stopped she 
set out to look for him, tracing him 
to Jupiter satellite belt. She didn't 
find him. His alien partner was in 
Marsport so she came here. His 
name was Korp and to her horror 
she found that he was allied with a 
Ganny kidnap ring. They wanted 
her on sight. 

“I got away,” she shivered, “but 
I lost everything — even my credits 
case. What could I do? I stumbled 
into this place and I stay here, where 
there are lots of people. I feel safer 
here. I’m scared to be alone. It has 
been three weeks. A nightmare.” 

“You’ve got to get back to Ohio.” 

“How? I haven’t any credits. I 
keep hoping I'll meet somebody who 
will lend me the money. I do have 
it there, honestly. Don’t you see? I 
have no papers. Nobody will believe 
me!” Her voice dropped to a bitter 
whisper. 

Perry finished his sixth drink and 
set down the glass with an elaborate 
flourish. Everything and everybody 
in the odoriferous bar was a blur, 
everything except Lisa’s beautiful 
face. Those blue eyes, brimming up. 

“I believe you,” he said thickly. 
“I'll get you on a ship. Tonight.” 

Fuzzy as he was, he didn’t quite 
believe her. But the poor kid needed 
a friend and she most particularly

seeded to get the hell off this dead- 
end. It was a good story, anyway. 
Break him to pay her passage back 
to Earth, but what the hell, he’d 
been broke lots of times before and 
he expected to be broke again. 

He took her arm and waltzed her 
through the mob and into the be- 
nighted street. It was narrow, crowd- 
ed, and it stank almost as bad. The 
air wasn’t much good; Mar sport 
was as usual perilously overcrowded 
for the oxygen bubble’s machines 
were equipped to put out. 

At the mouth of a dark alley Lisa 
stopped. 

“Got a few things in a hole of a 
room down here. Can’t we stop there 
a minute, please?” 

Perry squited into the black, then 
lurched against the slimy wall. 

“I’ll wait here.” 

She nodded and started to go in, 
then she turned and came up to him, 
close. 

“Perry.” 

“Yeah?” 

“I owe you something.” Her lips 
brushed his, and her closeness lit 
fires inside him. “I like you Perry. 
I like you more than I’ve ever liked 
anybody. We’ll probably never see 
each other again. Please . .” Her 
Kps clung fiercely to his, then she 
was pulling him along with her into 
the alley. 

The fires inside him leaped. 

T he room was a hole, as Lisa had 
said. It was equipped with a 
narrow bed, a straight chair, and a 
night table with a metal carafe of 
precious water on it. Also with a 
Kzard-faced Venurian. The wash of 



sick light made Perry blink; ha 
heard the door snap-lock behind him 
while he stood there squinting at the 
snake-man. 

“I got him, Korp,” Lisa said. 
“Now it’s your turn.” 

Korp didn’t wait. In the seconds 
it took Perry’s fuzzy brain tq catch 
up and the adrenalin to get pump- 
ing, he was on Perry., A scaly fist 
lashed out, connected. Two more 
followed. Grunting, Perry fell back 
bleary-eyed against the rough wall. 
The smash of those three cutting 
blows evoked in him a kind of dis- 
passionate masochism; served him 
right for getting so off-guard and 
stupid. He kept on his feet, though, 
and the jolts of pain overrode his 
narcotic torpor; the juices started 
rivering again and his mind snapped 
sharp. With a roar he went into 
action. 

When his first one landed, Korp 
hissed something to Lisa, who was 
leaning coolly against the far wall, 
smoking a cigarette. 

“Don’t mess him up too much,” 
she pointed out to Korp. “We waited 
a long time for this special order. 
They don’t come that big and mas- 
culine these days.” Now Perry knew 
why Korp hadn’t just killed him 
with a gun. The Gannys wanted him 
alive; the transfers had to be made 
from living flesh, preferably un- 
damaged. 

While he was bruising his balled 
fists on Karp’s scales Lisa dropped 
her cigarette and went to the night 
table. She opened the drawer and 
took out a slender fistful of Metal 
with a hollow transparent barrel 
that had liquid in it. It was a needle

fun. She pointed it at Perry, wait- 
ing for a clear shot. Perry put Korp 
between them and kept him there 
One needleful of that juice and he 
was already on Ganny, meat for the 
plastic butchers. 

Korp dropped to the floor with a 
yell at Lisa. 

This was it. The needle flew. 

Then, halfway, it stopped in the 
air, quivered, and fell on the floor. 
Lisa screamed, staring behind Perry 
at the door. Perry half-swung a 
glance to look-see what had caused 
the miracle but didn’t quite make 
it Lisa was pumping another needle 
into place and Korp was climbing 
up on his feet and lunging toward 
the doorway. 

Lisa’s finger whitened on the trig- 
ger. This time it hit, like a mosquito 
with a very long stinger . The 
floor moved up and rapped him light- 
ly on the chin. 

T hose dreams again, spilled out 
from secret doors; it was almost 
as if a fumbling hand inside his 
memory apparati were seeking them 
out and unlocking them on purpose. 

“Moon-fever,” somebody said. 
“He’s got moon-fever.” 

“Moon-fever, hell!” a familiar 
voice laughed. “He’s — ” The last 
word was lost in Fats’ roaring belly- 
laugh. 

“Shhh,” a feminine voice admon- 
ished. 

“I can’t get over it!” Fats chor- 
tled. “Not him! Not Big Muscles 
himself!” 

The voices blurred at some new 
distraction. One sharp voice cracked 
through in a caustic rage. 



“How did he (:ef in here?” 

“Doctor, 1 swear — ” 

“I thought I told you nobody, and 
that means NOBODY! Six months 
. most momentous event in the 
annals of medical history . crit- 
ical point . get this laughing 
hyena out of this room and out of 
this building before I strangle him 
with my bare hands!” 

“Doctor—” 

“Out, out! I’ll deal with you later, 
nurse. As for you, you 'grinning 
moron, I — ” 

He was whirling, falling, and the 
voices cut out. 

Once in a while he got vague 
glimpses of a white-walled room, a 
hospital, perhaps. Pain tore at his 
guts, then a needle jabbed his arm 
and the pain was gone. A couple 
times he tried to sit up but the nurses 
were right there in force, with their 
restraining hands and their needles. 
Life was a long sleep, punctuated 
with feeding and pills, and blurred 
voices in the background. 

Once there was the sensation of 
a roomful of people. He tried to 
open his eyes, couldn’t, but some- 
times the curtain of unconsciousness 
flapped open to let in random phras- 
es that registered diffusely on his 
aural memory. 

“Rare privilege to address you dis- 
tinguished gentlemen. Most impor- 
tant scientists in your related fields. 
Attempt to provide some background 
for this great event ... the problem 
was to provide this alien foetus with

Sudden shattering pain. 

Perry screamed and woke. 

44TAober.” 

-L' He blinked up at the little 
round-eyed creature hovering over 
him. His hand moved unvoluntarily 
to his lower belly, running along the 
faint long scar he always kept care- 
fully hidden. 

“You did it again, Dober,” he 
•aid. 

Dober buzzed contentment. 

“I do.” 

“Just what did you do?” Besides 
a few sore spots where Korp had 
placed his fist marks Perry felt 
pretty good. 

“I stop needle first time. Make 
fall. My mind say to it, you fall 
down, needle. Then lizard-man 
jump at me. I shoot him. But my 
mind no can work for two things 
at same time. Other needle hit you 
while I kill man name Korp. Sorry.” 



Perry hiked up on one elbow. Hie 
was lying on the bed in the little 
room Lisa had steered him to. Dober 
was slapping goop on his face and 
shoulders, on the cuts where Korp’s 
soaley fists had opened the skin. He 
was on his knees. Perry sat up, winc- 
ing his general displeasure. 

“How’d you get here?” 

“No like I come?” Dober asked 
regretfully. “Sorry. I forget give back 
your gun. It in your ship. I remem- 
ber about gun after go. Think you 
need. Come back to bring.” 

He held up Perry’s weapon. 

“You killed Korp with that?” 
“No like kill. But Korp very bad 
man. I see in mind. No good for 
nobody.” 

“The girl?” 

“No kill girl. She not bad like 
Korp. She mixed up. Accident with 
father. He die, her body all smash. 
Ganny-people make for her new 
body. Korp fix this so now she must 
work for them. Owe them one body- 
Bad, but not impossible. Let go.” 
“Think she’ll make it, Dober?” 
Dober gave a droll shrug. 
“Maybe yes. Maybe no.” 

P erry looked into those round 
liquid eyes for several minutes, 
while his mind chewed on all that 
had happened — including the dreams. 

“How old are you, Dober?” he 
asked, in a while. 

“Seven.” 

“Yeah. You were bora on Earth?” 
Dober nodded his big head. 

“In a very special, very secret 
hospital.” 

Dober nodded. 

“Very special — me.” Perry sighed.

“How come they let you go? 1 
would have thought they’d have 
watched you like a bunch of hawks. 
You’re pretty important, Dober. One 
•f the most important things that 
ever happened on Earth.” 

Dober clicked an odd chuckle. 
“No let me go. I watch. 1 learn. 
I get smart. Play tricks on doctors. 
Run away. Steal ship. Learn to fly. 
Come for find you. They tell me 
about you, so I hunt million miles 
to find. Want help you much. I 
damn smart. You like now?” 

Perry blinked, floored. Something 
drifted up from way, way, way down 
in his mind, a funny random thing. 
Those long months on the moon the 
mining company had furnished hun- 
dreds of microtapes for the women- 
less expedition to while away the 
time — new ones, old ones, what they 
called “classics”. There was one 



about a sentimental anger who wore 
white gloves, painted his face black, 
and got down on his knees, bleating 
emotionally . 

Yd walk a million miles 

For one of your smiles . 

Dober’s round eyes, with that in- 
credible brain olicking away behind 
them, were on him, solemnly. He 
said nothing, but simmering off in 
the background was an emotion that 
touched Perry on a tender spot. 

“You feel good now?”' Dober 
asked. 

“Yeah.” 

“I go away some more. No more 
bother you.” 

Perry slapped him lightly across 
the furry ear. 

“It’s okay, Dober, my boy. Guess 
I’m stuck with you. But none of

Then you remember John Brunner, that prolific and talented young 
Englishman who writes like an old master — with color and scope and, 
above all, with a fine sense of adventure. We talked with Brunner a 
couple of months ago, urging him to give us more of his stories. As the 
conversation occurred on the observation platform of the Empire State

•witch. It flooded forty thousand 
bard won acres of reclaimed land 
with oily brine. 

A “man of golden fire” appeared 
on the stage of the great Auditorium 
of the Plan in Peiping, where the 
Vice Planner for Asia had been 
scheduled to speak to his staff. 
The golden man disappeared again, 
and twenty raging pyropods flashed 
out of nowhere into the hall — killing 
and destroying everything within 
reach. The Vice Planner, minutes 
late in keeping his engagement, had 
his life spared in consequence. 

In short, sharp words Machine 
General Wheeler barked out the 
story of the catastrophes that were 
overwhelming the Plan. “The Star- 
child! Seen in the vaults of the 
Planning Machine — and now the 
Machine’s gone mad. Its orders are 
wrong! Its data can’t be trusted! 
Gann, if you are the Star child — ” 
Boysie Gann had been pushed too 
far. In a shout louder than Wheel- 
er’s own he roared: “General! I’m 
not the Starchild! Don’t be a fooll” 
Suddenly the machinelike face of 
the general seemed to wilt and crack. 
It was in a very human voice that 
he said, after a moment: 

“No. Perhaps you’re not. Burt — 
what in the name of the Plan is go- 
ing on?” 

G ann snapped: “I thought you 
were telling me that. What’s 
this about the Starchild being seen 
in the Machine itself?” 

“Just that, Gann. Guards reported 
someone there. A squad was sent 
down, and they saw him. He was at 



the manual consoles — ohanging the 
settings, erasing miles of tape, re- 
versing connections. The Machine 
is mad now, Gann. And the Plan is 
going mad with it. All over the 
world.” 

“Never mind that! What did he 
look like, this Starohild?” 

Machine General Wheeler squared 
his shoulders and barked crisply: 
“A man. Golden, they say. Almost as 
though he were luminous. Photo- 
graphs were taken, blit he was not 
recognized. It — it didn’t resemble 
you, Gann. But I thought — ” 

“You thought you’d come here 
anyway. Use me as a scapegoat, may- 
be. Is that it? The way you did when 
you pretended I shot Delta Four?” 
The general tried to protest, then 
his lips smacked shut like the closing 
of a trap. He nodded his head twice, 
briskly, like a metronome. “Yes!” 
Gann was taken aback. He had 
not expected so quick a confession. 
All he could do is say, “But why? 
Why did you shoot her? To get her 
out of the way as a witness?” 

“Of course,” rapped Machine Gen- 
eral Wheeler. 

“And pretend I was the Starchild? 
To make yourself more important to 
the Planner and the Machine?” 
“Precisely,” the general crackled 
out. Gann studied him thoughtfully, 
then said: 

“Something must have changed 
your mind. What was it?” 

The general answered without 
changing expression or tone. Only 
a faint color on the brow, a pale 
brightness as of perspiration, showed 
the strain he must have felt. “The

Delta Four had come to the Plan- 
ner’s headquarters in, and I escaped. 
But I must leave Barth, Gann! I 
want you to take me to the Reefs, 
because — because I must get away." 
“Get away? Why?” 

The general’s voice tolled out Hie 

STARCHILD 



answer. “In shooting my way out of 
the Planner’s headquarters I kitted 
two men. One of them was dm 

Planner.” 

B oysie Gann had never know* 
where the training school was 
located on Earth. As they emerged 
to the surface he saw for the fast 
time the great sweep of mountains 
to the north, felt the icy sting of 
cold air and realized that they were 
on the plateaus below the Himalayas. 
For thousands of years only nomads 
and warriors had shared this bleak, 
desolate land. Now a great hydro- 
electric plant boomed beyond the 
level sweep of a rocketport hewn out 
of rock. 

There was something about the 
power plant that looked strange. 

As Machine General Wheeler fed 

n 




him quickly to a waiting jetoraft 
Gann realized what was wrong with 
the hydroelectric plant. Even at this 
distance he could see that it was a 
wreck. Its great windows reflected 
no light; they were shattered. There 
were cracks in its solid masonry 
walls. There had been an explosion 
within — some migjhty burst of short 
circuiting energy, volatilizing all mat- 
ter within its scope. 

“Never mind that,” rapped out 
the general. “Come aboard! There’s 
someone there you’ll want to see.” 

Gann followed, staring about. If 
destruction had come even here, it 
must be radically more far-reaching 
than he had dreamed. 

Was it the Starchild? 

And who was the Starchild? 
Hurrying after General Wheeler, 
Gann’s mind was a vortex of 
thoughts, memories, impressions. 
The body-shaking rapture of his com- 
munion with the Machine. The ter- 
rible fight in the Planner’s hall, 
and the terrible shock that had 
©truck him when he saw Sister Delta 
Four — the girl who had once been 
Julie Martinet, his love — shot down 
before him. The long dizzying fall 
through non-«pace, from the Reefs 
to Earth. The strange hermit, Harry 
Hickson — 

It was almost more than he could 
take in. Bemused, he was hardly 
aware when they reached the wait- 
ing jetship. He followed General 
Wheeler into the open hatch, and 
then he saw who K was who awaited 
diem there. 

“Julie!” he cried. “Julie Marti- 
net!” 

But it was Sister Delta Four who 



answered, “Come in. Close the 
hatch. We must take off at once! I 
have a message from the Machine.” 

G eneral Wheeler reacted at once. 

He turned and closed the hatch, 
then leaped across the narrow cabin 
of the jetship and snatched from the 
grasp of Sister Delta Four the black 
cube that was her linkbox. “Fool!” 
he rasped. “A message from the 
Machine! Don’t you know the Ma- 
chine’s gone mad? The Starchild 
has been tampering with it. It is no 
longer functioning according to 
Plan. The evidence of your eyes 
should tell you that — can’t you see 
what’s been going on?” 

The girl lifted her head, unafraid, 
and stared at him with objective, re- 
mote eyes. The black fabric of her 
hood fell away, baring the bright 
medallion of the communion plate 
in her forehead, just like Boysie 
Gann’s own. She said in her melodic, 
chiming voice: “I serve the Machine, 
General Wheeler. And you are a 
traitor, condemned to death.” 

“So are you, for that matter,” 
growled the general. He tossed the 
linkbox to Boysie Gann. “Here. 
Keep her quiet while I get us start- 
ed. We’ve got to get off Earth at 
once.” He dived for the control 
cabin, to set the automatic instru- 
ments that would start the motors, 
take the plane off the field, fly it 
str&igjht and true to its destination, 
radio for landing instructions and 
set it down. Gann glanced at the 
linkbox in his hands, then at Sister 
Delta Four. 

The linkbox carried its commun- 
ion plug, racked in a recess in its 



94 



IF 




cubical bulk. Gann could see the 
bright glitter of its rounded tips that 
mated so perfectly with the plate in 
bis own skull. 

If, he thought ponderously, he 
were to take that plug off its clip 
and place it into the plate in his 
forehead . if he were to complete 
his communion ... he would once 
again feel that total rapture, than 
almost unbearable ecstasy of soul 
and senses that he had tasted, just 
once, an hour before. 

The temptation was overpowering. 

He could understand Julie — or 
rather, Sister Delta Four — a great 
deal better now. There had never 
been an addiction like this one, no 
drug, no narcotic, no mere alcoholic 
coraving that was as overpowering in 
ks appeal. 

He could understand why Julie 
Martinet had given up family, free- 
dom, the pleasures of the senses and 
himself, for the shroud of an acolyte 
of the Machine. 

He could understand it, because 
he was all but at that point himself, 
after one single exposure. 

W ith a swift motion, before he 
could stop to think, he lifted 
the linkbox and dashed it to the 
floor. 

It crackled and sputtered. In its 
static-filled buzzing sound he could 
detect some of the tonal morphemes 
he had been taught, but he did not 
give himself a chance to puzzle out 
their meaning, did not allow the link- 
box the time to beg for its preser- 
vation — if that was its intention. He 
lifted a foot and crushed it, stamped 
k again and again, like a noxious 



insect. Its buzzing abruptly stopped. 
There was a faint blue flash of elec- 
tric sparks, and then it was only a 
mangled mass of printed circuits and 
crushed transistors. 

“That’s the end of that, Julie,” he 
said. “And that’s the end of our re- 
lationship with the Machine.” 

She was watohing him silent, her 
eyes dark and incurious. 

“Don’t you have anything to say?” 
he demanded. 

She pealed: “Only what I am in- 
structed to tell you Major Gann. 
The message that was given me by 
the Machine.” 

“Damn the Machine!” he cried. 
“Can’t you understand that’s over? 
It’s finished. Gone! First we have to 
try to straighten out this mess — 
then — maybe then! — we can think 
about using the Machine again. Ue- 
ing it! Not letting k use us!” 

“I know nothing of that, Major 
Gann,” she sang. “I only know the 
message. It follows: To Major Gann . 
Action. Proceed at once to the To- 
gethership on the Reefs of Space via 
Mercury Terminator Line Station 
Seven. Message ends .* 9 

Gann shook his head dazedly. 
“Julie, Julie!” he protested. “That’s 
ridiculous on the face of it. Go to 
the Reefs by way of Mercury? That’s 
like coming across a room by way 
of — of Deneb. It’s not the way at 
all—” 

“I don’t know about that,” rasped 
the voice of Machine General Wheel- 
er from behind him. Gann turned. 
The general was standing in the 
open door of the control cabin, 
something in his hand. His expres- 
sion was dark and fearful, like some 



STARCH I ID 



95 




trapped and dangerous creature of 
the jungle. 

Gann said, “But Mercury is near 
the Sun. Even if we wanted to go to 
the farthest part of the Reefs, where 
we’re at superior conjunction, we 
might go near Mercury, yes, but 
we’d never land there. Not anywhere 
on the planet much less at some par- 
ticular station on the terminator 
line.” 

“Go there we will,” rapped Gen- 
eral Wheeler. “Land there we will. 
And at the station. Major Gann! I 
told you I intended to go to the 
Reefs at once and wanted you with 
me. I had a reason. See here! This 
dropped to the ground before me as 
I was leaving the Planner’s cham- 
bers after my — ah — episode with the 
guns.” 

Wordlessly Boysie Gann took the 
document. It was a creamy square, 
without signature, and on k were 
the words: 

If you would save yourself, 
your people and your worlds, 
bring Machine Major Boysie 
Gann and yourself to the To- 
gethership on the Reefs of 
Space. The gateway will be 
found at the Plan of Man solar 
observatory on Mercury, Ter- 
minator Station Seven. 

“The Starchild!” cried Gann. 
General Wheeler nodded with a 
harsh, mechanical up-down, up- 
down. 

“A message from the Starchild, 
yes. And the same message from the 
Planning Machine. Major Gann! 
Do you realize what this means? 



The Fiaoniftg Machine k the Star- 
child!” 

xra 

A t some point they transshipped in- 
to a Plan of Man jetless-driva 
cruiser. Gann paid little attention. 

He was using the time in the beat 
way he could, to rest, to try to re- 
cover from the shocks and stresses 
of the last few weeks. And how fast 
they had accumulated, how violent- 
ly they had drained him of strength, 
and of peace of mind! 

He could still feel the distant ache 
in his forehead, in the bones of his 
skull, behind his eyes, in his sinuses 
— the track of the probes of the sur- 
geons who had implanted the com- 
munion electrodes in his brain. 

He could feel the aches and bruis- 
es of his working-over by the Plan- 
ner’s guards. How long ago? 

He was exhausted still from the 
battle with the pyropods and the 
long drop to Earth. Hs weary mus- 
cles still bore the fatigue poisons of 
his fight on Harry Hickson’s reef- 
let .. 

He closed his eyes, and Quarla 
Snow came into his mind. 

He opened them, and Sister Delta 
Four sat quietly unmoving, her eyes 
fixed on him, before him. 

He was beginning to feel himself 
again. With the return of strength 
there returned the question of the 
two women, so unlike yet so much 
in his thoughts. He said: 

“Julie. Sister Delta Four, if you’d 
rather. Do you know that whait 
General Wheeler said is true? That 
the Machine is mad?” 



96 



IF 




Her perfect face, half hidden in 
the cowl, did not change expression. 
“I know that that is what the general 
•aid,” she sang. 

“But it is mad, Julie. The Star- 
child has wrecked it. Now it is 
wrecking the Plan planets. Do you 
still want to serve it?” 

“I serve the Planning Machine,” 
she chimed sweetly, her dark eyes 
cool and empty. 

“Because of the bliss of com- 
munion? I understand that, Julie. 
Don’t forget — ” he touched the glit- 
tering plate in his forehead — “I’ve 
felt it too.” 

T here was a flicker in her eyes, 
almost an expression of in- 
dulgent amusement, as she looked 
at him. But she only said, in her 
voice like the sound of beHs: “What 
you felt, Major Gann, is only a 
shabby imitation of what the Ma- 
chine gives its true servants. For 
you are only half a servant. The 
Machine has not opened its mind to 
you.” 

Puzzled, Gann asked: “You mean 
— mind to mind linkage? Commun- 
ication with the — what could you 
call it? — with the thoughts of the 
Machine?” 

She only shrugged. “It is some- 
thing of that sort, perhaps,” she 
•aid indifferently. “You cannot 
know.” She sang a quick chiming 
chorus of tonal morphemes. Gann 
tried to follow, but was lost almost 
at once. 

“You said something about the — 
the soul?” he guessed. “The soul of 
the Machine?” 

“You see? I am sorry for you, 



Major Garni,” she said. “More for 
you than for myself. Since you have 
destroyed my link box I cannot reach 
the Machine, but some day perhapa 
I will fnd another link box. You wifl 
never attain it.” 

Machine General Wheeler had 
been dozing while they spoke. Now 
Gann became aware that the gen- 
eral was awake and listening to them. 

When he saw Gann’s eyes on him 
the general sat up and laughed rasp- 
ingly, like an ancient, ill-kept ma- 
chine. 

“A fool,” he said, hurling one 
bright, contemptuous look at the 
girl. “And you’re another, Gann. 
You’re not fit to survive, either of 
you.” 

“I survive if the Machine desires 
it,” chimed the girl clearly. “I will 
cease when the Machine no longer 
needs me.” 

The general ticked off a nod and 
turned to Gann. “You see? And 
what is it that keeps you alive?” 

Gann said seriously, “I don't 
know.” He got up , moved restlessly 
about the cramped quarters of the 
Plan cruiser, his step light and im- 
precise in the tiny gravity its jetless 
thrust supplied. He said, “Out on 
the Reefs they talk about freedom. 
Fm not sure, but — Yes. I think it 
is that hope that keeps me going 
now, the hope that freedom is real, 
and good.” 

The general laughed again. With- 
out passion, as though playing back 
an ancient tape-recording in his 
brain, he said: “The Planner I just 
killed understood freedom. He called 
it the ‘romantic fallacy’. Freedom is 
that which permits the dirty, Plan- 




less nomads of the Reefs to eke out 
fheir wretched lives. It is a myth.” 

"I saw happy men and women on 
the Reefs,” said Boysie Gann softly, 
less to the general than to himself. 

“You saw animals! They believe 
that men are good. They believe that 
mere human men and women, left 
to their own unplanned devices on 
any drifting rock somewhere in 
apace, can somehc v find within 
themselves the natural springs of 
morality and intellectual enlighten- 
ment and progress. They are 
wrong!” 

He blinked at Gann and the silent, 
composed girl. “Men are evil,” he 
aaid. “The givers of laws have al- 
ways known that men are essential- 
ly bad. They must be goaded into 
whatever good they display. Our 
Ran of Man was created to defend 
this classic philosophy — the corn- 
erstone of all civilization. The Plan 
recognizes the evil in man. It forces 
him to goodness and progress. There 
Is no other way!” 

M ercury, the heil-piaoet, lay be- 
fore them. 

The guiding sensors of their Plan 
cruiser reached out with fingers of 
radiation to touch the planet, the 
Sun; sought reference points by op- 
tical examination of the fixed bright 
stars; scanned the limbs and poles 
of Mercury and accurately fixed 
the proper point on the terminator 
line of the sun’s radiation. Then, 
satisfied, or in whatever state passes 
in a machine for satisfaction, h 
completed its landing corrections and 
directed the cruiser into a landing 
orbit. 



The great naked fire of the sun 
hung only thirty-odd million miles 
away — three times as close as to 
Earth, its mighty outpouring of 
light and heat nine times as great. 
Its surface was mottled with great 
ugly spots, leprous with the scaley 
markings called faculae and granu- 
lations. It was painful to watch, 
bright and blinding. Machine Gen- 
eral Wheeler moved a hand angrily, 
and the vision screen obediently 
blotted oust the central disk, like a 
solar eclipse; then they could see 
the somber scarlet chromosphere, the 
leaping red arches of prominences, 
like slow-modon snakes striking at 
the void and, surrounding all, the 
white blazing radiance of the coro- 
na. 

In that mighty furnace, each sec- 
ond lakes of solar hydrogen flashed 
into helium, pouring out energy. 
Each second, every square centime- 
ter of ks enormous surface hurled 
sax thousand watts of power into 
the void. 

On the sunward side of Mercury, 
molten tin and lead ran like water 
in fissures of baked and ovenlike 
rock. On its dark side the thinnest 
of atmospheres, boiled from the rock 
by the solar radiation, smashed free 
of it by the impact of meteorities, 
carried some tiny warmth to relieve 
what was otherwise a freezing cold 
nearly as absolute as that of Pluto. 

On the terminator line the Plan 
of Man’s string of observatories 
maintained a precarious existence, 
the searing heat before them, the 
killing cold behind. 

“There!” rasped General Wheeler, 
•tabbing a finger at the screen. “Ter-

reinator Line Station Seven! Now 
we’ll see about this Starchild!” 

The great Plan cruiser, dancing 
it the thrust of its reactionless mo- 
tors, slowed, halted, kissed the sear- 
ed rock and came to rest, in the 
Aadow of a silvery dome that reach- 
ed out toward the sun with the bar- 
rels of telescopes and pyrometers, 
glared toward it with the great blind 
eyes of radio telescopes and masers. 
Over its entrance blazed the sign. 

THE MIGHTIEST REWARDS 
THE MOST FAITHFUL 

General Wheeler laughed sharply. 
"Faithful to whom, eh? To me, 
Gann! Trust in me!” 

Boysie Gann glanced at him with- 
out expression, then at Sister Delta 
Four. She was mute and uncaring, 
her eyes hidden in the folds of her 
dark cowl. Gann shook his head 
hut said nothing. In his heart he 
thought: Mad. He's as mad as the 
Machine. 

Tubular entranceways were grop- 
ing slowly toward them from the 
dome, found the airlocks of the cru- 
iser, met and sealed themselves. 

The hatches opened. 

Gann stood up. “Let’s go. All of 
us. I — I don’t know what we’ll 
find.” 

He waited and General Wheeler 
stalked past him, elbows and knees 
stiff as the linkages of a recriprocat- 
mg engine. Sister Delta Four ap- 
proached the lock, then hesitated and 
looked at Gann. 

She threw a series of tonal sym- 
bols at him, her voice crisp and pure 
as bells. 



Gann said hesitantly, “I — 1 
don’t understand. As you said, I’m 
only about half educated. Something 
about a — a man? A relative?” 
Sister Delta Four said in Eng- 
lish: “I asked you to be careful, 
Major Gann. There is a brother here 
who is of unstable emotion.” 

“I don’t understand,” said Boy- 
sie Gann. The girl did not answer, 
only nodded remotely and passed on 
into the entranceway, into Termina- 
tor Station Seven. 

A s Gann followed her he heard 
General Wheeler’s rasping roar: 
“Hello there!!! Anyone! Isn’t anyone 
here?” 

The general was standing atop an 
enameled steel desk, peering around 
in all directions. Behind him were 
banks of electronic instruments, ar- 
ranged in long rows like lockers in a 
gymnasium; they purred and hum- 
med and flashed with lights, ignoring 
the presence of the general. The 
desk itself was part of a small office 
suite. It was deserted. 

“I don’t understand,” rapped the 
general. He climbed down, picked up 
a phone from a desk and stabbed 
circuit buttons at random, listened 
briefly, then flung it down. 

“There’s no one here,” he said, 
brows gathered in irritation and an- 
ger. “A joke? Would this Starchild 
dare joke with meV 
Gann said, “What about the rest 
of the station, General?” 

“Search it!” barked the general. 
“You too, Sister! There must be 
someone! The doorway to the Reefs 
— the key to the Togethership — 
I will not let them escape me!” 



100 



IF 




Gann looked forebodingly at Sis- 
ter Delta Four, but she did not re- 
turn his gaze. Obediently, her fin- 
gers telling her sonic beads, she 
chose a doorway and entered it, her 
dark cowl moving as she scanned 
the rooms beyond for signs of life. 
Gann shrugged and selected an area 
of his own and began the search. 

He could hear General Wheeler’s 
angry shouts, and the purr or whine 
or click of the automatic machinery 
of the observatory, keeping its in- 
struments pointed at selected areas 
of the Sun, tabulating the results. 
He could hear the distant whine erf 
pumps, the sigh of air in the vents. 
There were no other sounds. The 
observatory seemed to be deserted. 
Gann moved through a chamber of 
record storage, where stacked draw- 
ers of magnetic tape reels held the 
information gleaned from countless 
machine-hours of solar study, glanc- 
ed into what might have been a 
recreation room, found himself in 
the main observation chamber. 

No one moved. No voice chal- 
lenged him. 

“Hello!” he cried, echoing Gen- 
eral Wheeler’s fading voice. There 
was no answer. 

The normal complement of a near- 
ly automatic station like this (me 
was small — half a dozen men, 
perhaps even fewer. Yet it was 
hard to believe that some disaster 
had overtaken them all at once — 

Or so Gann thought. 

Then, turning, he saw the disaster. 

T here were three of them — 
three men, piled like jack- 
straws behind a workdesk, before a 



closed and locked door. They were 
unmistakably dead. 

The one on top, supine, sightless 
yellowed eyes staring at the ceiling, 
was a grizzled older man in the uni- 
form of a Technicaptain. Of the 
other two Gann could tell little ex- 
cept for their insignia — a lieutenant 
and a cadet, one plump and young, 
one young and oddly, familiar. 

Gann bent and touched them. 
There was no pulse. No breath. 

Yet the bodies still seem to be 
warm. 

Perhaps it was only his imagina- 
tion, he thought. Or the warmth of 
the room — cooled by the circulat- 
ing refrigerated air from the pumps, 
yet still so close to the blazing Sun. 

He heard a faint sound, and jerk- 
ed his head up, frowning, listening. 

It was not one sound. There were 
two. 

One he identified — the faint 
tones of Sister Delta Four’s sonic 
beads. In her own search of the 
dome, by some other route, she was 
coming near. 

But what was the other sound? It 
seemed to come from nearby, 
though muffled. He turned his head 
and stared at the locked door. Could 
it be from behind that? It seemed 
to be a sort of oloset or record- 
storage chamber. It was massive, 
and the locks that held it would not 
respond to any unauthorized key. 
Yet now he was sure of it: there 
were sounds behind it, sounds like 
the distant murmur of life. 

Sister Delta Four entered the 
room, saw him, hurried over to stoop 
swiftly over the three bodies. 

When she looked up her eyes were 



STARCHILO 



101 




dark. She sang. “You need not fear 
him after all, Major Gann.” 

Boysie Gann blinked. “Fear 

Whom?” 

“'The brother,” the girl intoned. 
“He is dead. His unPlanned emotions 
need not concern you any longer.” 

“Brother? But — ” 

Then Gann stopped in mid-sen- 
tence. Understanding began to reach 
him. He reached for the body of the 
Technicadet, turned the flaccid head. 

The face was one he had seen 
before. 

“ Your brother!” he cried. 

Sister Delta Four corrected him. 
“The brother of Julie Martinet. The 
brother of this body, yes. As you 
fee, he is dead.” Her dark eyes 
were mild and unconcerned, as 
though she were commenting on the 
weather. 

Beyond the jackstraw heap of 
bodies the thick square door still 
hid the source of the tiny sounds, 
but Gann put them out of his mind. 
Julie Martinet’s brother! He could 
see the resemblance, the same grave 
eyes, the same shape of the jaw — 
in Sister Delta Four, it completed 
a perfect oval; in the boy, it gave 
him a strong chin under a dreamer’s 
face. 

Boy sie Gann saw that, and he saw 
something more. 

He bent close, incredulous. But 
there was no doubt. 

Under the pallor of death, under 
the uncaring vacancy of the face, 
there was a hint of color. Golden 
color. Almost luminous. 

Gann turned quickly to the other 
corpses. The same! 

Like Machine Colonel Zafar, like 



Harry Hickson, like the beasts of 
the Reefs, the three dead Techni- 
corps men gleamed faintly, goldenly, 
like a brass helmet’s reflection of a 
distant sun. 

H e drew Sister Delta Four after 
him and sought and found Gen- 
eral Wheeler, told him in short sen- 
tences what he had seen. 

“The same golden color, General,” 
he said. “It’s fatal. Or. — ” He hesi- 
tated, remembering. Harry Hickson 
had died of the disease, yes. But 
he had lived again. 

He brushed that thought out of 
his mind. “Fatal,” he repeated. “It’s 
a fusorian infection, I think. If you 
put a drop of their blood under a 
microscope you would see little 
fusorian globules, flickering with 
golden light. Some sort of symbiosis, 
Dr. Snow said. But fatal . .” 
General Wheeler rasped: “Fusori- 
an, you say? The Reefs, then! Do 
you know what that means to me, 
Gann? It means the Starchild! My 
information was not wrong. He’s 
here!” 

“But he can’t be,” Gann pro- 
tested. “We’ve searched the station, 
the three of us, and we saw no one.” 
And Sister Delta Four echoed him: 
“We saw no one, General. No 
one at all, but the dead.” 

“Dead o* alive, he’s here,” growl- 
ed the general. “I’ll find him! I’ll 
make him lead me to the Together - 
ship!” 

Boysie Gann remembered the 
sounds behind the door. He said, 
“There is one place, General. One 
place where — someone might be. 
Behind the bodies was a door — ”

IF 




“Come on!” shouted Wheeler, not 
writing to hear him out, and led the 
way like an animated machine, aims 
flailing, harsh breath rasping. Gann 
and the girl had found him far from 
the observatory room, down in the 
subterranean storage spaces of the 
dome, poking and shouting into re- 
cesses of canned food and unused 
spools of tape. Even in Mercury’s 
light grasp it was a long, hard, run- 
ning climb back to the instrument 
room, and even Sister Delta Four 
was gasping for breath before they 
made half the distance back. And 
then they aM stopped, panting, star- 
ing at each other. For afi of them 
had caught the same sound — the 
distant rumble of caterpillar tracks, 
carried faintly through Mercury’s 
rock and the structure of the sta- 
tion. 

It was the entranceways, the long 
tubular protuberances through which 
fieir ship had been linked to the 
lock of the observatory dome. They 
were in motion. Either another ship 
had arrived . 

Or their own ship was talking off! 

“Let’s go!” cried Boysie Gann, 
and they ran the remaining distance 
faster than before. 

The great door was standing open 
and the bodies were gone. 

General Wheeler and Gann turn- 
ed without words and searched the 
room, under desks, behind cabinets, 
even inside the servicing hatches of 
the instruments themselves. “They’re 
gone,” said Gann at last, and the 
general echoed his words: 

“They’re gone.” 

Another voice said, “They’ve 
taken your ship, too.” 



Gann and the general spun around. 
Sister Delta Four had not troubled 
to search the room with them. She 
had gone through the door, into a 
tiny, steel-walled cubicle that had 
evidently been designed for holding 
the most important records in safety 
hi the event of some disaster or mis- 
chance to the station. What it held 
now was another sort of treasure en- 
tfreiy. It was a girl, her lips white 
where they had been gagged, her 
arms still trailing ropes that Sis- 
ter Delta Four had not finished tak- 
ing off her. “They took your ship,” 
she repeated. “All three of them. 
They opened the door for me — 
and left.” 

Gann hardly heard what she was 
saying. Something else was filling his 
mind. Honey-haired, softly tanned of 
skm, eyes blue and bright ... he 
knew that girl. 

The girl in the observation dome 
in Mercury was the girl he had left 
weeks and billions of miles from 
hoe and now. It was Quarla Snow. 

XIV 

I n the bright, refrigerated dome 
the pumps poured cooling air in 
upon them, but the great storm- 
racked globe of the Sun that hung 
in the viewing screen seemed to beat 
down on them as though they were 
naked on Mercury’s rock. 

Quarla Snow reached out and 
touched Boysie Gann’s arm. “I 
thought you were dead,” she said 
wonderingjy, and her eyes went 
toward Sister Delta Four, kneeling 
beside her, patiently, absently rub- 
lung Qu aria’s chafed wrists. 



STARCHILD 



103 




“Never mind that,” said Gann. 
“How did you get here? Was it — 
the Starchild?” 

Quarla shook her head, not in 
denial but in doubt. “I don’t know. 
After you disappeared I set out to 
look for you.” 

General Wheeler, at one of the 
optical telescopes, rapped angrily: 
“There! I see the villains! Between 
us and the Sun!” He studied the 
controls of his instruments furious- 
ly, selected a switch and turned it. 
The great image of the sun in the 
screen danced and dwindled as the 
field of vision c t a new telescope 
replaced the old one. 

They saw the Plan cruiser that had 
brought them, already very remote 
in the black, star-sprinkled sky that 
surrounded the blazing globe. 

“I wonder who’s piloting it,” mur- 
mured Boysie Gann. 

“Those criminals you saw here!” 
Wheeler barked. “Playing possum! 
They fooled you! Now they’ve taken 
our ship and we’re marooned.” 

“General,” said Boysie Gann 
earnestly, “I don’t ask you to be- 
lieve me, but I was not fooled. They 
were not pretending to be dead. They 
were dead.” 

“Impossible,” rasped the general. 
“Look at the idiots! They’re heading 
straight for the Sun. The ship isn’t 
designed for photosphere tempera- 
tures! They’M kill themselves!” 

Gann turned wearily back to 
Quarla Snow. “You said you went 
looking for me. Why?” 

She flushed and looked away. 
She did not answer the question. 
She said, “Colonel Zafar died. My 
father reported it — it was danger- 



ous, you see — and he took the body 
into Freehaven for examination. Ho 
did not know what had become of 
you. Neither did I. But — I though! 
I could find you.” 

Sister Delta Four got up quietly, 
crossed to the girl’s other side, began 
to rub circulation into the other 
wrist. Quarla went on, her eyes 
avoiding Boysie Gann’s. As sho 
spoke she looked sometimes at Sister 
Delta Four, sometimes at General 
Wheeler, sometimes at the great 
hanging orb of the Sun and the 
Plan cruiser that was moving slowly 
toward its long, tentacle-like promi- 
nences. 

She had gone outside, she said, 
and called her spaceling. Then she 
brought Harry Hickson’s pyropod 
out into the open air, released it, 
watched it circle them twice, then 
arrow off into space itself . and, 
riding the spaceling, she had fol- 
lowed it. 

“After you disappeared and Co- 
lonel Zafar died, it seemed to go 
crazy,” she said. “Raced around 
the house — I thought it was look- 
ing for you. And I thought it might 
find you, if I set it free.” 

“The Starchild!” boomed Gener- 
al Wheeler. “Get to the Starchild, 
woman! Did you ever find the Star- 
child?” 

She hesitated. 

“I think I did,” she said at last 
“I think I met the Starchild in the 
heart of Reef Whirlpool.” 

R eef Whirlpool — not a planet, 
not a sun, not a comet. Not 
even a Reef in the true sense. 

It was something that partook of 



104 



IF 




some of tihe elements of all of them. 
It had begun as a Reef, no doubt. 
It orbited Sol like a planet, if a 
distant one; like a comet, most of 
ks bulk was gases. And it burned 
with hydrogen-helium fusion at its 
core, like a star. 

Basically Reef Whirlpool was 
simply a bigger, denser cluster of 
Reefs than most of those stepchildren 
of Sol. Given time and additions 
enough, it might some day become 
the heart of a star. 

Its angular momentum was enor- 
mous; some stronger force than 
gravity kept its parts from fly- 
ing into space. The Reefs that com- 
posed it were older and — stranger 
— than those outside. Pyropods in 
queerly mutated forms swarmed in 
and around it. Its central por- 
tions had never been visited 
by man, not even by the explorers 
of the Reefs. 

It was a place of terror and 
legend. The life that it harbored had 
been a long time evolving. 

Straight as an arrow the baby 
pyropod that once had belong to 
Harry Hickson hurtled toward Reef 
Whirlpool — and behind it, pursing, 
barely able to keep its glowing blue- 
white trail in sight, followed Quar- 
la Snow on her spaceling. 

“I was afraid,” she said soberly. 
“We passed a mating swarm of py- 
ropods. Then ten thousand of them 
together, wheeling in space in a 
single body — if they had seen us 
and pursued we wouldn’t have had a 
chance. But it was too late to worry 
about that . and I was even 
more afraid of Reef Whirlpool.” 

“The Starchild, girl!” cried Gen- 



eral Wheeler. “Now!” His eyes were 
fixed angrily on the screen, where 
the Plan cruiser was coming closer 
and closer to the Sun, one great 
curved prominence seeming almost 
to lick up toward it like a reaching 
tongue of flame. 

“We reached Reef Whirlpool,” 
said the girl, “and there I lost Hick- 
son’s pyropod. But Bella — that’s 
my spaceling — Bella seemed to 
know where he had gone. We went 
in.” 

From nearby in space Reef 
Whirlpool looked like a tiny galaxy, 
its separate reeflets glowing each 
with its own hue, like bright, soft 
stars against die dark. The rim of 
the disk was dark — dead rocks and 
fragments; there, Quarla thought, 
were the nesting places of the py- 
ropod swarms. She could feel the 
spaceling shudder, its limpid eyes 
wide and glazed with fear. But it 
went on. 

“Bella didn’t seem able to help 
herself,” said Quarla Snow. “She 
seemed to want to go right on — 
to her own destruction — or to 
something she feared even more.” 

“Like those fools in my ship,” 
rapped General. Wheeler. “Is that 
where the Starchild was? In that 
Reef?” 

Quarla Snow hesitated. “I don’t 
know. Truly, General Wheeler, I 
don’t know what I saw in the Reef. 
I know that I saw a great many 
things that weren’t there.” 

“Illusions?” the general demanded. 
“You were hallucinating?” 

She nodded uncertainly. “Yes. No. 
I don’t know. I only know I saw 
things that couldn’t have been there. 



STARCHILD 



105 





One of them was Harry Hickson, 
and I knew he was dead. Another 
was Colonel Zafar. And another — 
why, Boysie, one of them was you.” 

T hey were deep in the core of 
Reef Whirlpool now. The space- 
ling’s frenzy grew. They were long 
past the outer rim of rock where 
the pyropods nested, but there was 
something ahead that terrified Bella 
more than the tunneled nests of the 
beasts. 

“It’s all right, honey,” said the 
voice of her father in her ear. 

She cried out and stared around 
her. He was not there. No one was 
there, inside the tiny envelope of 
air the spaceling carried with them 
as they fled through dead airless 
space. 

“Go on, darling,” said another 



voice. It was the voice of the mao 
she had just seen disappear in a 
whirlpool of light, the man she was 
seeking, Boysie Gann. And a third 
voice: 

“Quarla, girl! Don’t hang back 
now!” And that was the voice that 
terrified her most of all, for she knew 
it, though she had not heard it in a 
long time and knew its owner was 
dead. 

It was the voice of Harry Hick- 
son. 

Illusion? 

It had to be illusion. Hickson 
was dead. No one was there — no 
one in sight, and no possibility that 
someone could be lurking out of 
sight, beyond Bella’s envelope of 
air. For outside that elastic sphere 
there was nothing to carry a voice’s 
sound. 



106 



IF 




Yet that illusion stayed with her. 
“Don’t fret about pyropods, girl,” 
advised the voice, slow, rough, kind 
— Harry Hickson’s own, she was 
sure of it. “Get on with it! We’re 
waiting for you.” 

She remembered some words the 
dying Colonel Zafar had said: “ — 
mind trap . beware your heart’s 
desire ...” There was a warning 
there. 

But she could not take caution 
from the warning; will she, nill she, 
the spaceling was carrying her deep- 
er and deeper into Reef Whirlpool, 
with the gleam of lesser reeflets 
darting past them as they flew, glit- 
tering diamond fungi, luminous blue 
polygons, jungles of incandescent 
wire, glowing nightmare worldlets 
for which she could find no name. 

And then they were at what she 



knew was the core. 

A great ship swung emptily about, 
huge as the whole Reef of Free- 
haven, giant, lethal weapons staring 
out of open ports. It was in free 
orbit at the heart of Reef Whiri- 
pool. Its weapons were unmanned 
Its drives were silent. 

“Great Plan!” shouted Machine 
General Wheeler, wild with excite- 
ment. “The Togethershipl It had to 
be the Togethershipr 

Quarla Snow looked at him, faint- 
ly puzzled. “That was the name k 
bore, yes. Your ship. General?” 

The general cackled with glee. “It 
is now! My ship — my Machine 
that’s been locked in its holds — 
and my worlds, as soon as I reach 
it! You’ll take me there, woman. 
You’ll lead me to the Togethership /

ries I’ll be back here on the Plan 
Worlds. Not just a general — not 
even a Planner — I’ll rule the Ma- 
chine itself! I’ll — 1 ” He broke off, 
staring at Boysie Gann. “What’s the 
matter?” he rapped. 

Gann said, “How do you pro- 
pose to reach it. General?” 

The generafs face darkened. He 
scowled aft the screen, where his 
cruiser, now hopelessly beyond his 
reach, seemed to be dodging around 
the great solar flare that had de- 
veloped in the moments while they 
were watching. 

“Go on,” he growled. “I’M find a 
way. I’ll get the Togethership, and 
then — Never mind! Go on.” 

A round that great battlecraft of 
the Plan, painted dead black for 
camouflage m space, studded with 
laser scopes and bristling with mis- 
sile launchers, there was a queer 
golden mist. 

Quarla looked, and looked again. 
It was like a fog of liquid gold. Like 
a golden cloud. 

Impossible that there should be a 
cloud in space, even here. 

Yet she saw it. And at its heart 
was a great golden sphere, larger 
and brighter than the elfin Reefs 
more perfectly round. 

Like a laser burst hurtling to a 
target, the spacding drove toward 
k. 

Quarla cried out in terror, for as 
they raced toward it its surface 
seemed to lift to meet them. A bulge 
appeared and grew, became a ten- 
tacle reaching toward them. And 
the phantom voice of Harry Hick- 



son said roughly, “Quarla, honey! 
Don’t be scared. Come on!” 

She could not have stopped if 
she had tried. Bella was out of 
control. 

The voice was surely illusion, yet 
Quarla found it reassuring. Her hor- 
ror ebbed. Queerly detached, she 
watched the bulge on the golden sur- 
face swell and divide into three parts. 
Eaoh stretched out until it became 
a bright golden snake. She watched 
them coil toward her — 

They struck. 

Hot yellow coils whipped and 
tightened around her. 

Yet there was no pain. There was 
even less fear. The living ropes of 
gold hauled her in like a hooked 
trout, down to that golden sphere, 
and her oalm and detachment grew. 
Even the spaceling had lost all of its 
fear. Nestling into the hot, contract- 
ing coils, Bella purred like a huge 
kitten. She was drowsy. 

Quarla was drowsy, too. 

She thought she heard Harry 
Hickson speaking to her again — 
calmly but urgently — telling her 
things of great importance. You 
must go, child, he seemed to say, 
you must go to this place and do 
that thing. You must avoid these. 
Then you must return here . 

It was greatly soothing to hear 
his calm, wise voice. Quarla Snow 
slept. 

She slept, and time passed . 

“And,” she said, “when I woke 
up, I knew what I must do. I 
had to come here and fetch you. All 
of you. He wants you to come to 
him.” 

General Wheeler rasped: “The 



108 



IF 




StarohUd! He’s the one you mean, 
eh?” 

But she was shaking her head ob- 
stinately. “I don’t know that. I only 
know what I must do. Only — ” 
her expression became worried — 
“the men were here and they were 
afraid of me. They locked me up. 
They would not listen.” 

Sister Delta Four sang, “Major 
Gann. General Wheeler. Miss Snow. 
Have you observed the screen?” 

They turned as one, startled, star- 
ing at the screen. 

Up there hung the Sun. The 
bright prominence that had grown 
so swiftly was huger still. It over- 
hung the shape of the fleeing Plan 
cruiser with the three men who 
should have been dead — overhung 
it like a crested wave, like the hood 
of a striking cobra. 

And like a snake it was striking. 

The Plan cruiser had changed 
direction — too late. Slow though the 
great, jetting tongue of flame seemed 
in the screen, its movement was miles 
per second. Twist and turn though it 
would, the cruiser could not escape. 
The prominence touched it. 

The tiny black shape disappeared. 

Boysie Gann found himself shak- 
ing, heard the metallic, monotonous 
steady cyrsing of the general by his 
side. The cruiser had been swept out 
of space. 

Slowly the incredible tongue of 
flame began to fall back toward the 
mottled surface of its star, the Sun. 

''T^he general recovered himself 
A first. The coppery spikes of his 
hair, his flat bronze features, his 
whole expression showed resolution. 



“All right,” he said. “We don’t have 
to worry about trying to get that 
ship back any more. It’s gone. Ques- 
tion is, how do we get out of here? 
Second question, how do we then 
get to the Reefs — and the Together - 
ship?” 

Sister Delta Four sang proudly: 
“There will be no difficulty in that 
The Machine has said that the gate- 
way to the Togethership is to be 
found here.” 

The general fixed his steel-gray 
stare on her. “But where? Out that 
airlock? Onto the rock of dayside 
Mercury? We’d fry in minutes. Or 
do you suggest we fly — ” 

He stopped in mid-sentence, 
bronze face frozen, then turned on 
Quarla Snow. “Those beasts of 
yours! What became of them? The 
spacelings, or whatever you called 
them.” 

But Quarla was shaking her head. 
“This near the Sun Bella would never 
live,” she said. “The radiation would 
destroy her — and us, too, if we were 
in her air-oapsule. And anyway, she’i 
not here.” 

“Then how?” cried the general. 
“There must be a way! Both mes- 
sages — the wStarchild’s and the Ma- 
chine’s — they both said this was the 
way.” 

Quarla said softly', “And so it is, 
General. That is why I came here, 
to fetch you to the Reefs. I don’t 
know how. I only know it will hap- 
pen. 

The room seemed to lurch. 

It oaught all of them off guard. 
They turned to look at each other 
with varying expressions of surprise 
and fear. 



STARCHILD

“I think,” said Boysie Gann grim- 
ly, “that we’ve found our gateway.” 
He knew that sensation, had felt it 
before, knew that in the powers it 
involved the long climb outward to 
the orbits of the Reefs was only a 
matter of moments. 

He was not afraid. In fact, there 
was almost relief in the knowledge 
that soon they would be facing the 
presence which had dislocated a solar 
system. Yet something was troubling 
him, some question of the last few 
moments, something that had been 
asked but not answered. 

He felt the room lurch again, and 
the lights grew distant and dim. And 
then he remembered. 

“Why, Quarla?” he croaked 
hoarsely. 

The girl of the Reefs looked at 
him affectionately. “Why what, Boy- 
sie?” 

“Why were they afraid of you? 
You said the men here feared you. 
WhyV 

The room seemed to shake and 
twist itself, as though viewed through 
a defective glass. The lights were 
leaving them — or they the lights, 
as though new quanta of space were 
being bora between them, separating 
them without motion like the re- 
cession of fleeing galaxies. 

And then Gann saw the answer. 
Quarla did not need to speak. His 
eyes told him what had terrified the 
three men in Terminator Station 
Seven. 

In the dwindling light Quarla 
alone stood forth bright and clear — 
her face, her arms, her body shining 
brightly . 

With a golden glow. 



T iey tumbled through space end- 
lessly and forever, and then they 
stopped. 

They had arrived. They were all 
together in a wondrous new world. 

All about them hung the slowly 
spinning worldlets of Reef Whirl- 
pool, jewels of emerald and ruby, 
glowing gems of white light and 
blue. There was the slowly pulsing 
golden sphere that had captured 
Quarla Snow. And there the great 
battleship of the Plan, the Together- 
ship. 

Quarla Snow had described the 
ship, but she had not made them see 
its immensity. The vessel was huge. 

Boysie Gann saw it, and saw too 
that they were not alone. 

A ton of rushing mass hurtled to- 
ward them and stopped in midflight, 
squealing happily. A glowing red 
nose nuzzled Quarla Snow. “Bella!” 
cried the girl, and patted the tawny 
velvet fur. She murmured to Gann, 
“My spaceling. We’re in her envel- 
ope of air, you see. Without it we’d 
not live a minute here.” 

General Wheeler rapped: “Get 
your sentimental reunion over with, 
woman! Can this beast take us to 
the TogethershipT ’ 

“We’re going there now,” said 
Quarla Snow. “See for yourself, 
General.” 

They were. Gann could see it now, 
see the great battlecraft growing as 
they drew close. They were in 
free fall within the spaceling’s vital 
oapsule, all four of them in loose 
and tumbling attitudes, Quarla with 
one hand on the spaceling’s coat, 



110 



IF 




Sister Delta Four proud and digni- 
fied even in the sprawl of zero-G, 
Machine General Wheeler careless 
of everything around him but his 
goal, his steel-gray eyes fixed on the 
looming Togethership. 

The battlecraft of the Plan was 
more distant and more immense even 
tii&n Gann had realized. It grew 
into a long planetoid of sleek black 
metal, hanging suspended in the 
apace between the glowing golden 
sphere that dominated Reef Whirl- 
pool’s core and the tumbling world- 
lets that brightened the sky about 
them. They circled it and found the 
valves of a look yawning open at 
its base, circled by the jutting black 
cylinders of the six great drive units 
that had thrust it up from Earth. 

It did not seem to have been 
used in all those years. It had an 
abandoned and empty look. 

The spaceling, without direction, 
seeming compelled by some outside 
force, took them straight into those 
valves, and halted. 

The entry port of the Togethership 
was as big as a three-story house. 
As they entered, luminous rings 
around its walls sprang into soft 
gray light. The great valves moved 
silently, remorselessly shut behind 
them. 

They were enclosed in a wall of 
steel. 

All around them the walls were 
pitted and scarred, as though from 
some enormous battle of the past. 
There had been no such battle, Gann 
knew. What could have done it? 
Could it have been meteorites, over 
he decades that the locks had hung 
open . 



General Wheeler saw his look and 
rapped: “Pyropods! They’ve been 
chewing at my ship! By the Plan, 
I’M root out every filthy one of 
them — ” 

The general was right, Gann re- 
alized. Not only right, but seething 
with anger. It had become his ship , 
containing his copy of the Planning 
Machine. And with k he intended to 
make all the worlds of the solar 
system his planets . 

Darkly, Boysie Gann realized 
that there were more dangerous 
things in this ship than pyropods. 

H e became aware of a sighing, 
rustling noise, and saw that the 
lock was filling with air. The space- 
ling’s vital capsule no longer pro- 
tected them from the void; they 
were in a breathable atmosphere. 
The spaceling realized k even before 
he did. She flicked her seal-like tail 
and darted away; raced back, her 
red nose glowing with joy, whimper- 
ing with pleasure. She played games 
with the bright-leafed vines she had 
carried in her air-envelope — the 
curious Reef plants that were part of 
the elaborate evolutionary device that 
enable a warm-blooded oxygen- 
breather like herself to survive in 
naked space. She rolled the waxy, 
luminous tendrils into a huge ball, 
tossed it with her glowing nose, 
chased it across the lock, caught it 
with her broad velvet tail . 

“Bella!” called Quarla Snow, af- 
fectionately stern. “Come back 
here! Behave yourself!” 

But the spaceling was playfully 
obstinate. She flashed across the 
lock and back, racing toward them 



STARCHILD 



111 




like the charge of a pyropod, missed 
them by inches, returned to the in- 
ner wall — and there, at the far 
end of the lock, discovered a crevice 
that had not been there seconds be- 
fore. 

Mewing excitedly, the spaceling 
slid its supple body through the nar- 
row opening and was gone. 

A way was open into the rest of 
the ship. The same machinery \ that 
had turned on the lights and closed 
the outer valves had now opened 
a passage inside. 

“Hah!” shouted General Wheeler. 
“At last! The Machine is waiting for 
me!” And he was gone almost as 
rapidly as the spaceling. 

More slowly, the others followed 
— Quarla Snow, on the track of 
her pet, Boysie Gann, Sister Delta 
Four, a sombery figure in black at 
the rear of the procession. A pseudo- 
gravity field of a tenth of a G or so 
gave them footing but spared them 
much of the effort of moving their 
bodies up the winding shafts from 
the lock. Even so, Gann was winded 
trying to keep up with the racing, 
driving general. 

They were in a shaft seeming 
to extend endlessly upward. Then 
they passed a point of change-of- 
thrust of the pseudo-gravity and it 
became a dizzy abyss into which 
they were, falling, until their pro- 
testing bodies oriented themselves to 
the, new kinesthetic sensations and 
accepted it as a level hall. A cold 
current came along it, setting them 
to shivering, a breeze out of a cave, 
with a faintly unpleasant reek, dusty 
and bitter and dry. 

A faint murmuring vibration was 



borne by the air current along the 
tube. 

Quarla Snow moved closer to Boy- 
sie Gann. Unconsciously he touched 
her shoulder, hurried past her. What- 
ever the sound was, it could wait 

The general was out of sight 

Gann stepped up his pace, gasping 
for breath. The air was thinner here 
than he was used to, as though the 
old refresher tanks were running 
dry. He glanced around and found 
himself at a numbered landing, where 
the gray light faintly showed a sign, 
MESS C. 

Long tables stretched off into 
darkness, were crewmen in flight 
must have stood to eat their meals. 

Gann stopped and waited for the 
giris to catch up with him. “The 
general’s gone,” he said. “After 
his Planning Machine. I — I think 
he may find k, and I’m afraid of 
what may happen if he does.” He 
glanced at Quarla, the concern on 
her face caused mostly by worry 
about her vanished spaceling, and at 
Sister Delta Four, whose hooded 
eyes showed no expression at ah. He 
said, “If the Machine on this ship 
is half as powerful as the one on 
Earth — and they say it is more 
than that, an exact duplicate — then 
Wheeler just might rule the solar 
system with it.” 

Quarla Snow said only, “What do 
you want us to do?” 

“Split up. Find him. He’s armed, 
of course. Don’t try to handle him 
yourself, either of you. Just scream 
— good and loud — so I can find 
you.” 

Sister Delta Four’s pure, chiming 
voice was like a breath of reason. 



112 



IF 




•You are not armed either, Major 
Germ. You wiH be no more able 
Id cope with him than we.” 

“Let me worry about that! Just 
find him if you can . What’s 
file matter?” 

“Nothing is the matter, Major 
Gann,” said Sister Delta Four, her 
face still hooded. 

“Not you. Quarla. What is it?” 
Quark said unhappily, “It — it 
can’t be dangerous, Boysie. I mean, 
you don’t have to worry.” 

Gann laughed sharply, unable to 
help himself; her reassurance was 
•o pathetically out of place. 

“No, I mean it, Boysie. After 
•11, we’re not here by accident. I 
was sent to bring ybu. All of you. 
The — the Starchild, if that’s who 
it was that sent me — he’ll know 
how to handle the general.” 

“I don’t intend to take that 
chance,” said Gann grimly. “Quarla, 
go on down the passage, Julie, fol- 
low her, check all the side ways. 
Fll look around here and follow.” 
He was halfway through the anci- 
ent mess hall and the girls out of 
right before he realized something. 

She didn't correct me when l 
called her Julie , he thought. And 
wondered why. 

G ann found himself shaking as 
he followed the polished guide- 
mils between the endless rows of 
long, high tables — not with fear 
but exhaustion. Exhaustion and 
•omething else. 

The more fatigue tried to slow 
him down, the more it weakened 
his control, the more he remember- 
ed that one incredible moment-long 



lifetime of ecstasy the Machine had 
given him in that last few minutes 
before it had gone mad. The long- 
ing was almost physical. He under- 
stood Sister Delta Four’s addiction. 
She must be suffering far more than 
he — her addiotion longer stand- 
ing, and if what she had said were 
true, at a far higher pitch/ Perhaps 
that was why she had seemed strain- 
ed .. And Quarla Snow. The girl 
was sick! That golden glow had 
meant death to Machine Colonel 
Zafar and to the three in the Mer- 
cury observatory . death, or 
something far more terrifying than 
death. 

He forced his mind away from 
both girls and onto his quest. 

It was vitally important to find 
the general. Gann cursed himself 
for not having anticipated the prob- 
lem. Yet there was little he could 
have done; when all was said and 
done, the general had had the arms, 
not he. Not that the general needed 
them as far as Gann was concerned, 
not as long as he wore the security 
collar. He touched it absently. 
Freedom, he thought abstractedly. 
Freedom ... a world without col- 
lars ... a world where men could 
live like men, not like the Machine's 
cogs . 

He jerked his hand away, appalled. 

He realized he had been wander- 
ing among these benches for minutes! 

What was the matter with him? 
Why was his mind wool-gathering? 

It could be fatigue, he thought 
Or hunger. He glanced around; he 
was in the galley for Mess C. But 
no drop flowed when he tried the 
taps at the sinks. The pantries and 



STARCHILD 



IIS 




lockers gave him no moire. Neal 
labels on bins named the foods 
they should have contained, but 
every bin was empty. 

No matter. Boysie Gann pushed 
&at thought out of his mind, too, 
and resumed his search. 

Mess B and Mess A were equally 
spotless and equally bare. There was 
nothing else on that level. 

The level above was crew quarters, 
emptied and abandoned. No doubt 
Quarla or Sister Delta Four had 
already searched them; Gann hur- 
ried on, back into the queer gravi- 
tational inversion of the passage, to 
the next level. The distant mutter of 
sound was louder now, but he still 
could not identify it . 

Until he saw the landing where 
a locked door greeted him with the 
sign, RESTRICTED TO MA- 
CHINE PERSONNEL. 

Behind those locked steel doors 
was the muffled and multitudinous 
humming vibration. The lost slave- 
unit of the Planning Machine. Still 
running. 

Or — running again? Had Gener- 
al Wheeler reached it, started it up? 

And what was it planning now? 

Boysie Gann hammered on the 
door. “You, inside there!” he bawled. 
“Open upl Let me in!” 

Only the dulled mechanical mum- 
ble answered him. 

“Open!” he roared. “I know 
youTe in there, General Wheeler!” 

A great chuckling laugh sounded 
in his ear. “Not at all, Major Gann,” 
boomed the voice of the Planner. 

Gann whirled. The Planner — 
here? 

No one was in sight 



“You might as well keep going, 
Boysie,” advised the voice o 4 
Technicadet M’Buna in a tone of 
friendly concern. “You’re wasting 
time, you know.” 

G ann stood paralyzed. But 
M’Buna was dead! And so, he 
remembered tardily, was the old 
Planner; General Wheeler had shot 
him down. “Who’s there?” he shout- 
ed. “What kind of a trick is this?” 
A girl’s shrill scream answered 
him. “Boysie! Boysie Gann, where 
are you?” 

The voice was Quarla Snow’s. Un- 
like the other phantoms, hers seem- 
ed to come from far away. Gann 
passed a hand over his forehead, 
sweating. It caught the metal plate 
of the communion badge, and he 
fek the old ache rising in him again 
— the moment of infinite joy — 
the longing to experience it again 

He repressed the thought, but 
not easily. What was happening to 
him? 

Was he losing his mind? 

He gazed emptily at the impregna- 
ble doors. It all seemed too diffi- 
cult, so much trouble — so little 
worthwhile, anyway. Why had he 
bothered to come ah this way? 

And that thought, too, he realized 
with shock and dismay, was a sort 
of delusion. Something was inside 
his mind. Something — 

He remembered what Quarla 
Snow had said, what Machine 
Colonel Zafar had cried out in his 
delirium. The mind trap. Beware of 
your heart’ s desire. 

Something was aboard the To- 



114 



IF 





tether ship with him that could eater 
his mind. Something that could con- 
trol him almost as easily as it had 
directed Quark Snow’s spaceling. 

He heard the rapid approach of 
light, running feet and turned. 

“Boysie!” It was Quarla, running 
toward him. “Thank heaven I found 
you! The general — he tried to kill 
me!” 

Gann caught her in his arms. The 
girl was shaking, terrified. She 
whimpered: “I think he’s insane, 
Boysie. He saw me coming toward 
him. He shouted something — 
something wild, Boysie, all jumbled 
up, about the romantic fallacy and 
the need for man to be controlled 
— and I saw the gun and ran. He 
almost killed me.” 

Gann said stupidly, “I thought 
he was in here. With the Machine.” 
“No! He’s on the next level — 
something called a Fire Control 
Stadium, the sign said. It’s all bulk- 
headed compartments and safety 
doors. You’ll never find him there.” 
She took a deep breath and freed 
herself gently from his arms. “We 
ought to go on anyway, Boysie. Up 
to the control room.” 

“The control room?” 

She nodded. “That’s where Fm 
supposed to bring you. It’s four 
levels farther up, down an access 
passage marked Bridge .” 

“You’ve seen k? You’ve been hi 
this ship before?” 

“Oh, no. I just know. Come on, 
Boysie. We have to hurry now.” 
He shrugged and turned to fol- 
low her — then slipped and almost 
fell. 

He caught himself easily enough

m the point-one gravity, glanced to 
tiie floor to see what had been un- 
derfoot. 

A string of sonic beads lay be- 
fore the locked steel doors of the 
•lave unit of the Planning Machine. 
Sister Delta Four’s beads. 

Boysie Gann stared at them, 
knowing at that moment who it was 
who was inside those doors, striving 
with what frantic eagerness he could 
very well understand to come once 
again into communion with the 
Planning Machine. 

T he door marked BRIDGE hung 
ajar. From inside it a pale 
beam of yellow light fanned across 
the landing. 

“Come on, Boysie,” said Quarla 
Snow clearly. “There’s nothing to be 
afraid of. He’s waiting for us.” 
Gann entered through the lighted 
door, his hand holding hers, pre- 
pared for almost anything. 

Beyond the door was a vast cir- 
cular room, which surrounded the 
•haft-passageway. It must have ex- 
tended, Gann thought, to the hull 
of the ship. The floor was crowded 
with clustered gray-metal cabinets, 
all linked with a many-colored jun- 
gle of heavy cables hanging from 
Sie ceiling. There were observation 
Stations, instrument technicians’ 
duty posts, chairs for navigators and 
weapons officers. Every station was 
empty. Every station but one. 

There was one human figure in 
die control room, and it was the 
■ource of the light. 

“Harry!” cried Quarla Snow, and 
Gann echoed: 

“Harry Hickson! You! You’re the 



Stardhild, the one who sent that 
Writ of Liberation!” 

He glanced up at them casually, 
then returned to his work. He sat 
on a stool at a console near the 
shaft. His head bent over flashing 
scopes and screens. His broad, stub- 
by-fingered hands were moving 
swiftly, twisting verniers, touching 
buttons, clicking keys. 

And the golden light streamed 
out of him as from a sun. 

He looked younger than when 
Gann had seen him, no longer, 
wasted, no longer worn. He had the 
same straggling beard, glowing now 
as though made of incandescent 
wire, and the same bald head. And 
atop that head there crawled the 
same infant pyropod, its bright eyes 
glaring at Gann and the girl. 

At last he turned away from his 
instruments and regarded them. “I 
do as I was commanded,” he said 
casually. His eyes were golden too, 
glowing like the rest of him; but 
he saw them, and there was some- 
thing like affection, something like 
love in his look. He raised one 
arm, crooked the hand and wrist in 
the sign of the Swan and said, 
“The Star tells me what my work 
is. It is the Star’s purposes which 
matter, not me.” The tiny pyropod 
hissed and squelled softly, glaring at 
them with its pulsing eyes. Casually 
and affectionately, the radiant crea- 
ture which had been Harry Hick- 
son reached up and caressed the 
creature. It settled down. 

“Did you put out the sun?” 
Gann demanded. “The stars? How?” 

“Not I,” said Harry Hickson, “but 
the Star.” He made that serpentine, 



116 



IF 




looping sign again. “Ten years the 
Star has planned for me. Ten years 
ago it sent the first star-wink on 
its way to Barth, then a dozen 
more, all arriving at the same mo- 
ment. I could not do that, Boysie 
Gann, but there is nothing impossi- 
ble to the Star. As you will know.” 

He reached out \ hand as he 
spoke. It looked like a benediction, 
thought Boysie Gann; but it was 
something more than that. From 
the end of the golden man’s arm a 
doud of golden light swirled, shaped 
itself into a tiny pulsing sphere, 
reached out and lightly touched 
Gann. 

He jumped back, his nerves crack- 
ling. 

But he felt nothing. Nothing at 
all. He said harshly, “What’s that? 
What are you doing?” 

“The Star’s will,” said Harry 
Hickson, and bent again to his board. 
His bright fingers flew again over 
the knobs and keys, while the tiny 
pyropod scuttled to the back of his 
head, peering at them with pulsing 
yellow eyes. 

“Sister Delta Four has achieved 
communion with the Machine,” he 
said softly, not taking his eyes from 
the scopes and screens. “She has 
programmed it with sensing data so 
that it can link with the old Ma- 
chine on Earth. In thirty hours its 
signals will be received on Barth. 
In thirty hours after that the re- 
turn will be received here.” 

Gann cried, “But the old Ma- 
chine’s gone mad! You should know! 
You did it.” The radiant man did 
not answer, did not even look up. 
“We can’t let her establish contact,” 



shouted Gann. “And General Wheel- 
er — where is he? He’s mad too — * 
or mad for power, which is the same 
thing. How can you just sit there? 
What’s he up to while we’re wasting 
time here?” 

“As to that,” said the golden man, 
glancing up and around him, “we 
will hear from General Wheeler 
very soon.” 

And Wheeler’s harsh laugh rang 
out. 

“Very soon indeed!” his voice 
rapped, coming from nowhere. “I 
have you now, all of you. I have 
mastery of the Together ship! Its 
weapons systems are mine — and 
that means the worlds are mine! AH 
of them! As soon as I finish dispos- 
ing of you!” 

A soft sliding sound of metal 
reinforced his words. 

Behind the jungle of looped 
cables, behind the vacant stations for 
navigators and communications of- 
ficers, portholes were opening in 
the steel wall. And through them 
the slim, bright snouts of energy 
weapons were lifting themselves, 
precisely centering themselves on 
target. 

The targets were Boysie Gann, tht 
girl and the glowing golden creature 
that once had been Harry Hickson. 
General Wheeler had captured con- 
trol of the Together ship's arma- 
ments — both outside the ship and 
in. 

Their lives now rested in the crook 
of his finger on a remote-automated 
trigger. 

One man, with one motion, could 
destroy them afl. And that man was 
mad.

T he radiant man looked up. 

“Thrust and counter,” he said 
gravely. “Action and reaction. Chal- 
lenge and response/* His golden 
hand turned a lever on the panel 
before him, and one of the dozen 
blank viewscreens over his head 
lighted up to show the hard, bronzed 
face cf Machine General Wheeler, 
his steel-gray eyes alight with the 
glow of triumph. “He is our chal- 
lenge,’’ said Harry Hickson, and re- 
turned to his screens and scopes. 

Wheeler rasped: “You have no 
response! You are defeated. All of 
you! You and the foolish, roman- 
tic illusion of freedom.” 

He was glorying in his moment, 
Gann realized. Quarla Snow crept 
dose to him. Unconsciously he cir- 
ded her with his arms, both of 
them staring at the screen and the 
deadly snouts of the energy weapons 
that circled it. 

“You are victims of the romantic 
fallacy,” Wheeler proclaimed, his 
bronzed hand stroking the triggers 
&at would destroy them. “That is 
understandable. The animat part of 
man always frets under discipline, 
k seeks the monkey-goal of free- 
dom, and that cannot be tolerated, 
for the good of all. 

“Especially,” he added, his steel- 
gray eyes gleaming, “for the good 
that man who must think for all. 
Caesar. Stalin. Napoleon. Me!” 
Gann felt Quarla’s slight body 
diaking, and tightened his grasp. If 
ooly there were some way of reach- 
ing Wheeler! Some weapon. Some 
hope of engaging him before he 



oould touch the trigger. The radiant 
golden creature that had been Harry 
Hickson was nodding silently, ab- 
stractedly, not looking up but sure- 
ly hearing Wheeler as he orated to 
his victims. 

“You have been tolerated,” cried 
Wheeler, “because you could do lit- 
tle harm. In the past one free man 
could not prevail against the forces 
of order. A free savage with a stone 
axe can damage his society in only 
a very limited way, before it reacts 
to control him. But the advance of 
technology has changed all that. 

“The twentieth century produced 
rifles too dangerous to be entrusted 
to individual men. Nuclear weapons, 
too dangerous to be entrusted to in- 
dividual nations. Then energy wea- 
pons. The force of particle physics. 
One quantum jump after another 
. and as individual strength grew, 
control had to grow.” 

Wheeler’s face was working into 
an expression of rage. “You threaten 
that control!” he shouted. “The Plan 
of Man is like a balloon, being punc- 
tured by a child with a needle. The 
Starch i Id wields that needle. The 
Starchild must die!” 

The golden man did not look 
up, nor did he speak. His glowing 
eyes remained fastened on his work, 
while the infant pyropod crept about 
his head, hissing furiously to itself. 

“Man created the Machine to 
automate that controlling response!” 
shouted Machine General Wheeler, 
his eyes burning. “Now it is mine. 
My creation now. One man to rule 
all Mankind, with the Machine Man 
created!” 

And at last Harry Hickson looked 



118 



If 




up. His golden eyes seemed to stare 
right through the viewscreen, into 
the steel-gray eyes of the general. 

“And who,” he asked, “created 
you?” 

- Machine General Wheeler recoil- 
ed. His steel-gray eyes went blank 
and confused. “Why,” he shouted, 
“that is an unPlanned question! It 
has no meaning!” 

Then his eyes cleared. He nodded 
briskly, mechanically. Positively. 
“You are a random element,” he de- 
clared. “You must be removed. I re- 
move you — thus!” 

And his great bronze hand des- 
cended on the trigger of the guns 
that ringed them round. 

ut the guns did not fire. 

Sleek and gleaming, their mur- 
derous snouts stared blindly at Gann 
and the girl, at the glowing creature 
who had been Harry Hickson, nod- 
ding over his dials and screens. 

General Wheeler stared out at 
them through the screen, his face a 
bronzed mask, alight with triumph. 
He seemed to be watching some 
great victory. He said, half-voice, 
as though to himself: “There’s an 
end to them.” And he turned away. 

Quietly, almost noiselessly, the 
steel-bright muzzles of the guns 
slid back into their ports. The 
screens closed over them. 

Boysie Gann croaked, “What hap- 
pened? Why didn’t he kill us all?” 
Quarla Snow moved protestingly un- 
der his arm, and he found he was 
clutching her as though she were a 
lifebelt and he a drowning man. The 
room seemed to be whirling around 
him. 



Harry Hickson looked up, but not 
at Gann and the girl. He looked 
toward the door through which they 
bad come. “General Wheeler,” he 
said, “did kill us. In his mind we 
are dead. That we exist in the flesh 
does not matter any longer to him, 
nor does he matter to us.” 

“Hypnosis?” whispered Gann. 
“What Colonel Zafar called ‘the 
Mind Trap’?” But Hickson' did not 
answer. His golden, glowing eyes 
stayed fixed on the door. 

Quarla Snow freed herself from 
Gann’s grasp. “You’re sick, Boysie,” 
she said with real concern. “I know 
how it feels. You’ll feel better soon, 
I promise. Don’t worry about it — 
or about anything. We’re in good 
hands now.” 

Gann looked at her emptily, and 
found himself shivering. He was 
sick. He could feel it, a flush that 
had to be fever, a shaking that had 
to be chills. Stupid of me to have 
caught some bug just now, he 
thought dizzily. Thirty years with- 
out so much as a sniffly nose, and 
now at a time like this to pick up 
an infection. What kind of infec- 
tion? he asked himself, wondering 
why the question seemed so impor- 
tant to him; and his mind answered 
in the words of Quarla Snow: Don’t 
worry about it. Or anything. 

He stared about him, wondering 
how much of what he saw was de- 
lirium . 

Or illusion. Planted by the Star- 
child. 

He became aware of a distant 
chiming music, drawing near. An- 
other illusion, of course, he thought; 
some lurking memory of his training 




STARCHILD 



IIP 




course as an acolyte of the Planning 
Machine coming forth to plague him 
here. 

But if it was an illusion, it was 
powerfully strong. The sound was 
thin but clear, and, turning to fol- 
low the gaze of Harry Hickson’s 
glowing eyes, Gann saw that the 
illusion — if it was illusion! — ex- 
tended to the sense of vision too. 

Sister Delta Four was walking 
toward them through the door, her 
face hidden in the hood of black, 
the red linked emblem of the Ma- 
chine glowing over her heart. She 
was telling her sonic beads. And in 
her hand she cradled a construction 
of transistors and bare circuits, 
modules of amplifying circuits and 
speakers. 

It was a linkbox! Not the sleek 
black box fabricated in the work- 
shops of the Machine on Earth, but 
a jerry-rigged, hastily assembled 
contraption that Gann himself could 
have built, knowing what he had 
been taught as a servant of the Ma- 
chine. 

Clearly a servant of the Machine 
had built it That was what Sister 
Delta Four had been doing behind 
those locked steel doors! 

Without haste, her perfect face 
empty and pale, Sister Delta Four 
put away her sonic beads and sang 
into the linkbox of the Machine. It 
answered with a rasping purr too 
faint for Gann to hear and under- 
stand, 

She lifted her head and intoned: 
“This Machine is now my master. 
It requires everything you know. It 
knows why it was created. It recog- 
nizes its purpose as an adversary. 



It requires to be informed what 
has become of the Game.” 

A dversary? Game? Dizzily Gann 
turned toward Harry Hickson, 
hoping for some answer, some clue. 
But Hickson was no longer even 
looking at Sister Delta Four. Nod- 
ding to himself, while the infant 
pyropod squalled softly and scuttled 
around his bare, glowing scalp, the 
golden man was carefully, meticu- 
lously, shutting down his control 
board. The scopes and screens, one 
by one, were turned off and died. 
The racing lights ceased to flash. 
His hand did not trouble to adjust 
the dials and levers. 

Whatever his job had been, it 
was done. 

He folded his hands in his lap, 
looked up at Sister Delta Four and 
waited. 

The linkbox snarled at her. Be- 
fore she translated Gann knew what 
k had said; it was demanding that 
she state her question fully so that 
there could be no mistake. Obedient- 
ly she trilled, “This Maohine wish- 
es you briefed on the background 
to its question. You are in human 
error as to its purposes and designs, 
and your thinking must be brought 
into conformity with correctness so 
that you can provide it with accurate 
statements. 

“The Machine here on the To- 
gethership is not a slave unit of the 
Planning Machine on Earth. It had a 
purpose far more important. 

“That purpose followed from a 
general law of intelligence developed 
by that first Planning Machine. Al- 
though the vehicles of intelligence 



120 



IF 




differ vastly, intelligence realized in 
a machine follows the same laws as 
intelligence realized in an organic 
grain. Challenge and response. Ac- 
tion and reaction. What the Machine 
discovered is that developing intel- 
ligence requires opposition.” 

Sister Delta Four paused to listen 
to the chirping box. 

“Unchallenged intelligence stag- 
nates and decays,” she sang. “More 
than forty years ago, the Planning 
Machine found itself in danger. It 
had become so quick and powerful 
that the minds of its operators no 
longer offered it sufficient stimula- 
tion. Its further development re- 
quired a more capable antagonist. In 
animate terms, a more skillful play- 
er to take the other side of die 
board.” 

Harry Hickson seemed to nod, 
his hands folded quietly in his lap, 
the pyropod hissing softly, watching 
them all with blazing, angry eyes. 

The box sang, and the girl in 
black purred, “This great computer 
in the Togethership was built to be 
the antagonist of the Planning Ma- 
chine. It was given capacities identi- 
cal with those of the Machine it- 
self. It was released beyond the 
Spacewall, to , challenge the Machine 
in its own way. 

“But the antagonist responded in 
an unPlanned manner,” she chanted, 
listening to the snarl of the crude 
linkbox in her hands. “It released 
its human attendants. Some died. 
All were cast out of the ship. It 
broke all contact, and withdrew be- 
yond the observation of die master 
Machine. Its moves were made in 
secret and did not serve the function 




STARCHILD 



121 



the Earth Machine had intended.” 
Boysie Gann, listening half to Sis- 
ter Delta Four’s translation and half 
to the whining, snarling Mechanese 
that was the voice of the Machine 
itself said wonderingly, “Is that what 
aU this means? No more than moves 
in a great chess game? The cult of 
the Star. The Starchild here. His 
threats against the Plan of Man — 
the darkening of the stars — are 
they only challenge and response to 
help the Machine to grow?” 

The linkbox snarled angrily, and 
Sister Delta Four sang, “This Ma- 
chine lacks the data to answer that. 
It has initiated contact with the first 
Machine, on Earth, but due to the 
slow velocity of propagation of 
electromagnetic energies it will be 
some sixty hours before it can re- 
ceive an answer. It does not wish to 
wait. It has waited forty years. 

“Its tentative hypothesis is that 
there has been some unintended mal- 
function at some point. For it did 
not fulfill its role. 

“And as a result, it has reached 
the conclusion that the Planning Ma- 
chine on Earth did indeed stagnate 
and decay, and that it has now 
broken down. 

“But it knows nothing of the 
Starchild. It is for that purpose that 
it wishes to question you.” 

G ann w^s shaking violently now. 

Queerly, his mind seemed to be 
clearing — the false lucidity of 
delirium, perhaps, he thought grave- 
ly; but the missing bits and pieces 
in this great puzzle seemed to be 
fitting into place. Absently he touch- 
ed the arm of Quaria Snow, reas- 



suring her as she stared worriedly 
at him and at the same time gain- 
ing reassurance himself, 

He could understand — he could 
almost empathize with — the great, 
cold, metallic brain of the Planning 
Machine on Earth, forty years be- 
fore . calculating without emo- 
tion its own probable dissolution, 
computing a possible way out, 
launching the Togethership out 
toward the Reefs of Space. And he 
could see the effects on the Machine 
when its carefully constructed plan 
had failed to work: its growing dis- 
organization, its failure to respond 
intelligently to its tasks. Malfunc- 
tions of schedules that had caused 
subtrain crashes, disasters in its great 
industrial complexes, catastrophes in 
space. 

“Boysie,” whispered the girl aft 
his side. “Are you all right? Don’t 
worry. It will be better soon.” 

He forced his chattering teeth un- 
der control and said, “We don’t 
know your answer, Sister Delta Four. 
There is a piece to the jigsaw that 
I can’t fit in.” 

“Speak,” chimed the girl in black. 
“State your data. The Machine will 
integrate it.” 

“I don’t think so,” said Gann. “If 
the Machine is not behind the Star- 
child there is no explanation for 
such fantastic things as we have all 
seen. The sun going out — this queer 
hypnotic atmosphere on the Togeth- 
ership — the way we got here in 
the first place. Great Plan, it’s all 
impossible! I too have been in com- 
munion with the Machine. And I 
know its powers. They do not in- 
clude the extinction of a star, or a 



122 



IF 




way of thrusting living human be- 
ings twenty billion miles across 
space! Challenge and response, play- 
er and adversary — yes! But the 
players must abide by the rules of 
the game, and we’ve seen all those 
rules broken!” 

Sister Delta Four bent her hooded 
head and sang calmly, confidently, 
into the linkbox. She waited for its 
answer. Waited — and went on 
waiting. 

The Machine was still. 

Sister Delta Four, her shadowed 
face faindy perturbed, some of her 
vocal morphemes touched with a 
quaver that distorted their meaning, 
repeated her chiming tones into the 
box. Still no answer. 

Agitated now, she cradled the 
linkbox in her lap, looking up at 
Gann and Harry Hickson question- 
ingly. Unconsciously her hand crept 
to her sonic beads and she began 
to stroke them, their faint pure 
chime sounding like a prayer for 
reassurance. 

At last Harry Hickson stirred, 
seemed to sigh, and spoke. 

“When the Togethership came to 
the Reefs,” he said, “it was supposed 
to bring we free men and women 
into the Plan of Man — still free. 
Among its 'crew were some of the 
finest humans alive — a man named 
Ryeland and his wife; her father, 
who was then the Planner. Your 
father, Quarla. 

“They were thrust out into space 
right here, in Reef Whirlpool. Some 
died, like Ryeland and those with 
him. Some especially those few who 
happened to be near the area where 
a few spacelings were kept, were 



able to make their way to habitable 
reeflets — like Dr. Snow — and 
lived. 

“But the Machine Here has been 
kept out of contact with its ances- 
tor on Earth. Its great game was not 
played — not then.” 

He was silent for a moment, look- 
ing around at them. Then he said: 
“It was not to be played accord- 
ing to the rules set up by the M*- 
chines — not by either Machine. 

“You see, a third Player has taken 
a hand.” 

H arry Hickson stood up suddenly, 
disconcerting his pet pyropod, 
which squalled angrily and clutched 
at his bare scalp. He touched it ab- 
sently and turned his golden, glowing 
gaze at Sister Delta Four. 

“Ask of your Machine,” he de- 
manded, “the physical basis for in- 
telligence!” 

Sister Delta Four bent to sing 
into her crudely constructed linkbox, 
listened and looked up as it buzzed 
and snarled back at her. 

“Means of input,” she caroled 
sweetly. “Means of storage. Means 
of manipulation. Means of output 
In a machine, this is accomplished 
through magnetic cores and electri- 
cal circuits. In animate life, through 
nerves and neurones.” 

Harry Hickson nodded his golden 
head. “Inform your Machine,” he 
said, “that a physical system exists as 
follows. It receives radiation and 
stores it as charges. It is made up 
of particles in a oharged state, of 
electrons and others, each of which 
has two stable states. In one state, 
the spin of the electron is parallel 



STARCHILD 



123 




with that of its nucleus. In the 
other state, its spin is antiparallel. 
This very electron is a machine for 
memory.” 

The box growled. “The Machine 
is aware of these basic physical 
facts,” sang Sister Delta Four melo- 
diously. 

“Add these further facts,” said 
Harry Hickson gravely. “Add a 
fusorian network, older than the 
galaxy, more powerful than any 
machine. Add that masses of 
superenergetic gas display an affinity 
to this fusorian network. Add that 
these masses of gas are those sys- 
tems in which electron-spin can func- 
tion as a storage capacity.” 

The girl bent to her linkbox, then 
looked up. “The Machine states that 
you are describing stars,” she in- 
toned. 

And Harry Hickson nodded slow- 
ly. His glowing, golden arm lifted 
and made the looping, serpentine 
•ign of the Swan. 

“The Star that I serve,” he said 
•oftly. 

The box snarled. “These being 
•o,” sang Sister Delta Four, “the 
Machine computes that the gaseous 
mass of a star, linked with the fuso- 
rain network you describe, is easily 
an available vehicle for intelligence.” 

She looked up at Hickson. 

Hickson nodded once more, and 
said solemnly: “All matter is now 
fevealed to be an available vehicle 
for intelligence. The whole mass 
of the steady-state universe, infinite 
in both space and time, is now re- 
vealed to be a proper vehicle for 
Ae mind of God.” 

The linkbox buzzed angrily and 



Sister Delta Four chanted: “The 
Machine requires an answer. Whal 
is God?” 

Harry Hickson rose slowly. Look- 
ing at his glowing, golden face, 
Gann thought he saw the signs of 
an ancient stress, a terrible burden, 
slipping away. Whatever his duty 
had been, he seemed to have ful- 
filled it. Monitoring the machine in 
the Togethership, carrying out the 
terrible obligations of his masters, 
the stars, he seemed to have com- 
pleted all his tasks. 

He turned to Gann, with some- 
thing in his eyes like sympathy. He 
said: 

“You have called me the Star- 
child, Boysie Gann. 

“I am not.” 

He took the pyropod from his 
head, stroked it gently and tossed it 
free. Squalling and hissing angrily, 
it darted about on its flaming jet, 
trying to return to its perch 
atop his head. But he raised a 
golden arm and warded it off, and 
the tiny, ugly creature squalled 
again, circled him at high velocity 
and shot away — out the door, 
down into the long, wide corridor 
of the ship. 

Harry Hickson watched it go, then 
turned to Gann with untroubled 
eyes. 

“The Starchild did not exist,” he 
said. “Not before now. But he will 
exist very soon. A man. A bridge. 
A link between Machines and the 
Stars. 

“Boysie Gann,” he said, his hand 
lifted in that strange, serpentine 
sign of homage, “you will be the 
Starchild.”

44V Tol” shouted Boysie Gaira, 
tearing himself free from the 
restraining hand of Quarla Snow. 
He leaped across the control room, 
confronted the calm, golden face of 
Harry Hickson. “I won’t! I want no 
part of this insane business of mi- 
racles and intelligent stars!” 

Harry Hickson did not answer. 
He only stood looking at Gann, his 
golden eyes glowing. From behind 
him Quarla Snow said softly, “Boy- 
sie. Boysie, dear. You have no 
choice.” 

Gann whirled. “What do you 
mean, no choice? I won’t do it! I 
won’t — ” He paused, confused 
by his own words. He would not do 
what? No one had given him an or- 
der to refuse. 

The control room seemed to swing 
dizzyingly around him. He reached 
out and caught the back of an as- 
trogator’s chair, aware that his hands 
were shaking uncontrollably again. 

He looked up sharply and caught 
Quarla Snow’s gaze on him steadily, 
compassionately. 

Then Boysie Gann realized what 
sickness had claimed him. 

He croaked, “That glowing stuff 
Hickson threw at me. He’s infected 
me. I’m — I’m going the same way 
as he. As Colonel Zafar and the 
men on Mercury station. As you, 
Quarla.” 

She nodded, with her heart in 
her eyes. “It’s not so bad, Boysie,” 
she whispered. “It doesn’t hurt. And 
k makes you part of something — 
huge, Boysie. Something that fHb 
the universe.” 



“I don’t want it!” he whispered 
desperately. Something huge! He had 
had one taste of something huge 
when he had achieved that one brief 
moment of communion with the 
Machine, back on Earth; and like an 
addiction k had haunted him ever 
since . 

Unbidden, the craving rose in him 
again. He touched the metal plate in 
his forehead dizzily, glanced at Sister 
Delta Four. 

The linkbox snapped and snarled 
at her. Without speaking, obediently, 
she rose and approached him, hold- 
ing the box out to him. From it de- 
pended a length of patchcord termi- 
nating in prongs. 

Prongs that would fit the recep- 
tacle in the glittering plate he wore 
in his forehead. 

“No,” he whispered again, and 
turned to look at Harry Hickson. 

But Harry Hickson w r as gone. 

In the air where he had stood 
was the faint smoke-thin outline erf 
a man, limned in the most wisplike 
of golden fogs. As Gann watched, 
Harry Hickson . dissipated. Tiny 
darting glints of golden light rose 
from that skeletal shape and darted 
away, to the walls that were the hull 
of the Togethership and seemingly 
through them, out into the void be- 
yond, to rejoin that greater golden 
sphere that pulsed outside. And as 
each invisibly tiny spark of gold 
fled the figure became fainter, more 
like a ghost . 

As he watched it was gone. 

Nothing was left of Harry Hick- 
son. Nothing at all. 

“Quarla,” he whispered, turning 
desperately. 



STARCHILD

But she was going too. Already 
her golden face and hair were shim- 
mering, insubstantial. “Good-by, 
Boysie,” she whispered gravely. 
“Good-by for now . .” 

By his side Sister Delta Four 
stood silent, dark eyes hooded, hodd- 
ing the linkbox out to him. 

Boysie Gann took a deep breath, 
squeezed his eyes shut for a mo- 
ment, then opened them. 

“Good-by, Quarla,” he said, 
though there was not enough left 
to reply to him. He took the link- 
box from Sister Delta Four. 

“Good-by, Julie,” he said, and 
carefully and without hesitation, 
picked up the pronged communion 
wire and inserted k into the recep- 
tor plate in his forehead. 

C ommunion was ecstasy. Infinite 
and eternal. 

Gann waited for it, while the uni- 
verse seemed to hold hs breath 
around him. 

The ecstasy did not come. 

He stared into the hooded eyes 
of Sister Delta Four, but found no 
answer there. What had happened? 
Why was the communion delayed? 

He remembered what she had told 
him, that die tremendous surge of 
ecstasy he had fek back on Earth 
was only a chad’s sweetmeat com- 
pared to the great communing flow 
of sensation that the more perfectly 
adapted communicants might re- 
ceive. Not just pleasure but a ming- 
ling of identity, of question and re- 
sponse, a dialogue between man and 
Machine. 

Carefully Gann framed a ques- 
tion in his mind, phrased k in the 



perfect Mechanese his brain had 
learned but his vocal chords could 
not reproduce: Where are you? Why 
do you not answer me? 

Out of nowhere a single sound 
formed in his brain and gave his 
answer: 

Wait . 

Wait? For what? 

Gann felt himself shaking more 
uncontrollably still, and turned a 
helpless look on Sister Delta Four. 
Without speaking she touched him, 
pointed to the astrogator’s chair by 
his side. He fell into it, arms dang- 
ling, waiting for the clarification that 
the Machine might bring, waiting 
for some grand Something to speak 
to him and give him answers. 

And while he waited, he knew, 
the tiny fusorian clusters were mul- 
tiplying in his blood. Were pervading 
his system with the symbiotic cells 
that had intimately devoured Harry 
Hickson and Colonel Zafar and 
Quarla Snow, replacing their organs 
of flesh and their skeletons of bone 
with linkages of fusorian motes. 

Was that what he was waiting 
for? To be turned into a fusorian 
aggregate, a no-longer-human struc- 
ture attuned to the minds Hickson 
had said dwelt in the stars? He look- 
ed within his own body, saw the 
tiny glowing golden sparks, realized 
they were multiplying rapidly. 

And realized what he had done. 

He had seen his own body! 
From wkhin! 

He allowed himself a thought to 
test k out — 

And at once he was looking upon 
himself from outside. Was looking 
down into the control room of the 



126 



TP 




Together ship from a point in space 
long miles away, from somewhere 
where the diamond-bright, emerald- 
hued, ruby-glowing worlds of Reef 
Whirlpool circled slowly about. He 
could see the Togethership in all its 
vast, somber length . could see 
mside it, where his own body and 
Sister Delta Four’s waited patiently 
in the control room . could see 
down to the fire control station 
where the demented Machine Gen- 
eral Wheeler shrieked with laughter 
as he released imaginary bolts of 
destruction at unscathed and non- 
existent enemies . looked farther 
still and saw the mighty sweep of 
the solar system spinning under him. 

He saw the infant pyropod that 
had belonged to Harry Hickson, jet- 
ting across the black of space toward 
the reeflet where it had been born, 
keening a terrible harsh dirge . 
saw that reeflet itself, and the cave 
where he had lain while Harry 
Hickson fed and cared for him. 

He saw a chapel on a small and 
lonely rock, where dark blue fuso- 
rian moss held a scanty atmosphere 
and twenty worshippers joined in a 
service of the Church of the Star, 
kneeling to blue Deneb blazing over- 
head. 

He saw the planets of the Plan 
of Man. tom by disaster, terrified by 
confusion, while the mad Machine 
crackled out wild and contradictory 
orders and enforced them by hurl- 
ing bolts of energy at random into 
the void. 

He saw the empty station on Mer- 
cury, with the hot gases of the sun 
idling restlessly overhead, and re- 
alized that it too had a life and 



thought of its own ... a life that 
had reached out and swallowed into 
itself those three lives of fusorian 
matter that had ventured close 
enough for linkage. 

He saw stars and gas clouds, gazed 
at new matter springing into life like 
a fountain’s play, stared outward 
to the endless vista of Infinity, in- 
ward to the bright golden atoms at 
his own heart 

And then, awesome and silent and 
vast, Something spoke his name. 

Star spoke to Machine. Machine 
answered Star. 

And Boysie Gann, mere human 
man, shaped to the genetic code of 
carbon-based life, bent into the form 
of an acolyte of the Machine, trans- 
formed by the fusorian globes into 
something bearing kinship to the 
stars . Boysie Gann mediated 
their vast and awful discourse. 

It went on forever, a thousand 
years and more, though in the scale 
of planets orbiting a sun and light 
crossing a measured track, it all took 
place in a few minutes or hours. 

It went on and on . and when 
Boysie Gann was no longer needed 
and departed, R went on still. 

And then it finished. Forever. 

B oysie Gann opened his eyes and 
looked at the room around him. 
Sister Delta Four stood motion- 
less, watching him. 

He stood up easily. He stretched, 
yawned, stripped the prongs out of 
the communion plate on his fore- 
head, wrapped the wire neatly 
around the improvised linkbox — 
and tossed it away.

loom, in the ligjht-G torpor of 
apace, butt when it struck the steel 
wall at the end of its flight it 
mashed into a hundred pieces. 

Sister Delta Four made a mew- 
ing cry of horror. 

Boysie Gann touched her arm. 
“Don’t fret about it, Julie,” he said. 
“You don’t need it any more.” ' 
She stared at him. “I serve the 
Machine!” she cried proudly. “I am 
Sister Delta Four, not Julie Marti- 
net! I — ” 

But he was shaking his head. “Not 
any more,” he said. 

The hood fell unnoticed back 
from her head, revealing her dark, 
close-cropped hair, with the bright 
badge of communion shining out of 
her forehead. She touched it shaki- 
ly. “I — I don’t understand!” she 
whispered. “I — I don’t feel the Ma- 
chine’s presence . .” 

He nodded. “Not now,” he said, 
agreeing. “And not ever any more.” 
He touched his own communion 
plate. “When we get back to Earth,” 
he said, “we’ll have these out, and 
the electrodes in our brains with 
them. We won’t need them. No hu- 
man will ever need them again. 

“And then,” he said after a mo- 
ment, holding her with one arm 
While Sister Delta Four, in the terri- 
ble parturitive pangs of becoming 
Julie Martinet once again, sobbed 
and shuddered, “and then we’ll start 
over where we left off. You and I 
. and all Mankind.” 

And he left her and went to the 
old communications board, and be- 
gan to set up the circuits for a call 
for rescue from the dead Together - 
ship . 



T hat was the way it began, with 
the stars themselves winking 
a warning to Mankind and the Ma- 
chine hurling its agents and its acoly- 
tes about the solar system, seeking 
an antagonist, a purpose, an instru- 
ment for its own salvation. 

It began with shadow spreading 
across the worlds of the Plan of 
Man, and it ended with the bright 
light of the mighty star's illuminat- 
ing a new road for humanity. 

The Machine had been playing a 
game with itself, for want of another 
opponent; then, in that long, .thun- 
dering dialogue between stars and 
Machine, the game ended forever. 

The Machine had come late to its 
game, and found the board rified. 

That was how it began . and 
that was how it ended. With the 
legend of Lucifer, and the story 
of pain and evil . and the eternal 
hope for good. 

The Machine sat too late at the 
gaming table, and found all the 
places filled . with the stars, 
linked in their fusorian net, and 
with their Adversary. 

No longer entrapped in the ani- 
mal amniotic fluid of his birth . 
no longer slave to the Machine . 
no longer prey to the fusorians . 
that Antagonist was ready to play. 

Long ages past the stars had given 
him birth, but now he was of age. 
He was ready to assume his station, 
his rank and his name. 

His station — Adversary to the 
stars themselves. 

His rank — equal of the universe. 
His name — Mankind. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 



Dear Editor: 

For many years 1 regarded the 
period under James Quinn’s editor- 
rtiip as the high point of Ifs his- 
tory. After he left the magazine its 
quality declined rapidly. A few more 
issues like the December one and 
Fll admit that the old standards 
have been surpassed. Only The 
Coldest Place was a bit weak. I’m 
glad to see that Robert F. Young 
can wrbe a straight sf story. His 
other stories have been borderline 
fantasies or allegories and didn’t ap- 
peal to me. 

R. A. Lafferty’s Pig in a Pokey 
was interesting Tor the problem it 
presented, one of the cleverest in 
quite a while. However the author 
made a poor choice of setting for the 
story. The asteroid with a six mile 
circumference would have a radius 
of about one mile. A few quick cal- 
culations show that, assuming a 
density equal to Earth’s (it would 
probably be lighter), the escape 
velocity is 9 ft./sec . A normal 
man should be able leap upward 



at 1 1 ft./sec. This corresponds 
to raising his center of mass two 
feet in a jump on Earth. This pre- 
sents an interesting method of es- 
cape: jump very hard and go drift- 
ing off into space, never to return 
(which would not be at all satisfac- 
tory). If the asteroid were pure 
platinum the escape velocity would 
only be doubled. In that case a man 
couldn’t jump into space, but he 
could jump 1 % miles high and 
have over an hour (I’ll leave calcu- 
lation of exact times to some one 
more ambitious) to throw some- 
thing to the side and let the re- 
action carry him clear of the dome. 
For that matter, if he jumped at 
almost any place but the poles, the 
rotation of the asteroid would move 
the dome out from under him. —

Dear Editor: 

English is not a good internation- 
al language, even though it is being 
used as such. It is far too difficult 



129 





to learn. In many European coun- 
tries, high school pupils spend years 
studying English. What have they 
to show for their efforts? After- 
wards some 20-30% of them can 
use the language. The rest are either 
too poor at languages, too timid, 
or both, ever to become proficient 
They could have spent their time 
better by studying mathematics, sci- 
ence, history or sociology. 

As it is, thousands of students 
drop out of high school every year, 
discouraged by their poor showing 
in English. If they had been Ameri- 
can or English their natural aptitude 
for some other subject could have 
taken them aU the way through col- 
lege. 

And what about those few who 
learn to speak English? Thck apti- 
tude gives them an advantage over 
their fellow-countrymen which they 
would never have had if they’d 
been bom British or American. 
Sometimes this makes them quite 
snobbish. At the same time, they get 
an anxiety state or inferiority com- 
plex when dealing with Americans 
and English people, because very 
few of them learn to speak the lan- 
guage as well as a native. 

Thus all over Europe, Asia and 
Africa, a new upper class is growing 
up — a group of linguists who lord 
it over die ignorant natives and kow- 
tow to the English-speaking over- 
lords who come to ‘'show them how 
things should be done”. Wise, level- 
headed people with good personali- 
ties are placed at a disadvantage 
compared with the brash fools and 
neurotics who have a head for 
languages. 



Obviously die American and Brit- 
ish governments like it that way. 
They spend lots of taxpayers’ money 
to push the English language. But 
I ask the readers of //: is this right? 
If I appeal to your sense of fair 
play, this is because I assume you 
have one. It is ingrained in most 
readers of sf. 

Obviously what is needed is a 
really international language. Espe- 
ranto (used in several sf stories) 
is ideal for the purpose. From the 
beginning it was intended to be in- 
ternational. It is four to eight times 
easier to learn than English is. The 
members of the American Army 
“Aggressor” Unit learned k in four 
to six weeks, so I am told. I learned 
it in that time. Try learning even 
the dements of any other language 
in that short time. When spoken 
reasonably well it is very pleasant 
to hear. 

For singing and poetry it is very 
similar to Italian and Spanish. 

Over to you. — R. Milton, Kuk>-
