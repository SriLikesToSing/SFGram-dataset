What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 



aj 



CVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to self- 
advancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and suc- 
cessful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature’s laws, accumulat- 
ed through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of 1% of the earth’s 
people were thought capable of receiv- 
ing basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which “whispers” to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak- 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleep- 
ing. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of self- 
tunderstanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world’s 
oldest institutions, first known in Amer- 
ica in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosi- 
crucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the “Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis,” abbreviated by the ini- 
tials “AMORC.” The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a com- 
mercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, “The Mastery of Life.” 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe

STUFF & NONSENSE? 



“/^AREFUL not to walk under 
the boarding ladder, Capt. 
Florio climbed into the spaceship, 
counting so he’d enter the airlock 
with his left foot first. He made 
sure he had his lucky charm with 
him as he and the crew took the 
traditional drink for the road, and 
then the ceremonial last cigar- 
ette before takeoff. Florio was 
just in time to avert disaster. ‘Not 
three on a match, you idiot!’ he 
shouted at the astrogator.” 

No doubt of it — superstition 
will ride the rockets, along with 
atomics and computers. That’s* 
inevitable in the zoom from cave 
to spaceship in only a few thous- 
and years. 

Editing GALAXY and BE- 
YOND FANTASY FICTION, 
I’ve found remarkably little con- 
flict in the two seemingly opposed 
views. So, evidently, do many 
writers and readers, for they ab- 
sorb and create them with the 
same enjoyment and stimulation. 

Both science and superstition 
have the same purpose — to in- 
terpret reality. Both use the same 
methods — observation and de- 
duction. Both have been astonish- 
ingly right and wrong. 

The two basic differences are 
that science is dynamic, supersti- 
tion static: and that absurdities 
are expunged from science — the 



Piltdown forgery, for example — 
while they are perpetuated in su- 
perstition. That, of course, is 
because science constantly chal- 
lenges its findings, whereas super- 
stition never does. 

Nonetheless, it did what it set 
out to do, show cause and effect 
where none had been discernible, 
and it found more truth than it 
is generally given credit for. 

If you want to investigate su- 
perstition in detail, the most 
complete record I’ve discovered 
is The Standard Dictionary of 
Folklore, Mythology & Legend, 
edited by Maria Leach and pub- 
lished by Funk & Wagnalls in 
two imposing, truly beautiful 
volumes, with slipcase, at $20. 
Its more than 8,000 items form 
a body of beliefs so immense that 
no one, however enlighted, can 
escape having at least some, 
though they may be disguised as 
“common knowledge” or convic- 
tions “independently” arrived at. 

Are they all incorrect? To 
think so is to be as blindly dog- 
matic as most irrational beliefs. 
Very many of our medicines — 
digitalis, ephedrine, quinine, 
among others — were folk reme- 
dies. Carrot diets were prescribed 
for conditions that we now can 
diagnose as vitamin deficiencies. 
Even our antibiotics were used

in crude form, for moldy bread 
was applied to serious wounds 
centuries ago. 

How many more ultra-modern 
advances lurk in superstition, just 
waiting to be uncovered by re- 
search? We have no idea and 
won’t have until they’re turned 
up. But only a dogmatist would 
condemn all folk beliefs as worth- 
less. 

Bergen Evans seems to do so 
in his The Natural History of 
Nonsense (Knopf, N.Y., $4), but 
that’s because his is a subjective, 
crusading approach — Evans is a 
sort of anti-Fortean Charles Fort. 
Some of his debunking is em- 
barrassing to those of us who in- 
nocently accepted such errors as 
the sense of direction in animals. 
We read constantly of dogs and 
cats finding their way home 
across the whole country — yet 
why are the Lost & Found ads so 
full of pets that couldn't make it 
across-town? 

If our critters seem incredible, 
wait till the first men return with 
tales of those (if any) on other 
planets! Flamboyant as they’ll 
be, however, many will inevitably 
contain facts that science will 
ultimately verify by plodding ex- 
periment. 

I think that’s what is so fas- 
cinating about science fiction and 
fantasy: the “What if — ?” pre- 
mise is answered in science fic- 
tion in realistic terms that may 



be entirely impossible, and in 
fantasy by supernatural-seeming 
terms that may be surprisingly 
true. But true or not, they both 
offer absorbing opportunities for 
guesswork and wonder for read- 
er and writer. 

Here is a puzzle for you to 
explore: How much of our “com- 
mon knowledge” will fossilize in- 
to superstition? 

The Jewish dietary laws make 
excellent sense, for instance — in a 
tropical country without refrig- 
eration. They harden into ritual 
when transplanted to temperate 
climates, especially where there 
is meat inspection. 

Or take the first automobiles. 
Manufactured by buggy-makers, 
they were buggies, except for mo- 
tive power, even to the whip- 
holder alongside the driver! 

Or the columns used in neo- 
Greek buildings — absolutely 
needless because of cantilever 
steel girders! 

And spaceships — a wasteful 
needle design only because they 
must pierce the air. When we can 
assemble them out in space, they 
can be any shape. Yet the needle 
design may linger for years! 

To get back to Capt. Florio and 
his touching farewell to Earth: 
Would three on a match apply 
to butane lighters? And what hap- 
pens to the superstition when we 
have self-igniting cigarettes?

The Midas Plague 




Illustrated by EMSH 



A ND so they were married. 

The bride and groom 
/ m made a beautiful couple, 
she in her twenty-yard frill of 
immaculate white, he in his 
formal gray ruffled blouse and 
pleated pantaloons. 

It was a small wedding — the 
best he could afford. For guests, 
they had only th^ immediate 
family and a few close friends. 
And when the minister had per- 
formed the ceremony, Morey Fry 
kissed his bride and they drove 
off to the reception. There were 
twenty-eight limousines in all 
(though it is true that twenty of 
them contained only the caterer’s 
robots), and three flower cars. 

“Bless you both,” said old man 
Elon sentimentally. “You’ve got 
a fine girl in our Cherry, Morey.” 
He blew his nose on a ragged 
square of cambric. 

The old folks behaved very 
well, Morey thought. At the re- 
ception, surrounded by the 
enormous stacks of wedding gifts, 
they drank the champagne and 
ate a great many of the tiny, de- 
licious canapes. They listened po- 
litely to the fifteen-piece orches- 
tra, and Cherry’s mother even 
danced one dance with Morey for 
sentiment’s sake, though it was 
clear that dancing was far from 
the usual pattern of her life. They 
tried as hard as they could to 
blend into the gathering, but all 
the same, the two elderly figures

in severely simple and probably 
rented garments were dismaying- 
ly conspicuous in the quarter- 
acre of tapestries and tinkling 
fountains that was the main ball- 
room of Morey’s country home. 

When it was time for the guests 
to go home and let the newlyweds 
begin their life together. Cherry's 
father shook Morey by the hand 
and Cherry’s mother kissed him. 
But as they drove away in their 
tiny runabout, their faces were 
full of foreboding. 

It was nothing against Morey 
as a person, of course. But poor 
people should not marry wealth. 

TV/JOREY and Cherry loved each 
other, certainly. That help- 
ed. They told each other so, a 
dozen times an hour, all of the 
long hours they were together, 
for all of the first months of their 
marriage. Morey even took time 
off to go shopping with his bride, 
which endeared him to her 
enormously. They drove their 
shopping carts through the 
immense vaulted corridors of the 
supermarket, Morey checking off 
the items on the shopping list as 
Cherry picked out the goods. It 
was fun. 

For a while. 

Their first fight started in the 
supermarket, between Breakfast 
Foods and Floor Furnishings, just 
where the new Precious Stones 
department was being opened. 



Morey called off from the 
list, “Diamond lavaliere, costume 
rings, earbobs.” 

Cherry said rebelliously, 
“Morey, I have a lavaliere. 
Please, dear!” 

Morey folded back the pages 
of the list uncertainly. The lava- 
liere was on there, all right, and 
no alternative selection was 
shown. 

“How about a bracelet?” he 
coaxed. “Look, they have some 
nice ruby ones there. See how 
beautifully they go with your 
hair, darling!” He beckoned a 
robot clerk, who bustled up and 
handed Cherry the bracelet tray. 
“Lovely,” Morey exclaimed as 
Cherry slipped the largest of the 
lot on her wrist. 

“And I don’t have to have a 
lavaliere?” Cherry asked. 

“Of course not.” He peeked at 
the tag. “Same number of ration 
points exactly!” Since Cherry 
looked only dubious, not con- 
vinced, he said briskly, “And now 
we’d better be getting along to 
the shoe department. I’ve got to 
pick up some dancing pumps.” 

Cherry made no objection, 
neither then nor throughout the 
rest of their shopping tour. At 
the end, while they were sitting 
in the supermarket’s ground-floor 
lounge, waiting for the robot ac- 
countants to tote up their bill and 
the robot cashiers to stamp their 
ration books, Morey remembered

to have the shipping department 
save out the bracelet. 

“I don’t want that sent with 
the other stuff, darling,” he ex- 
plained. “I want you to wear it 
right now. Honestly, I don’t think 
I ever saw anything looking so 
right for you.” 

Cherry looked flustered and 
pleased. Morey was delighted 
with himself ; it wasn’t everybody 
who knew how to handle these 
little domestic problems just 
right! 

H E stayed self-satisfied all the 
way home, while Henry, their 
companion-robot, regaled them 
with funny stories of the factory 
in which it had been built and 
trained. Cherry wasn’t used to 
Henry by a long shot, but it was 
hard not to like the robot. Jokes 
and funny stories when you need- 
ed amusement, sympathy when 
you were depressed, a never-fail- 
ing supply of news and informa- 
tion on any subject you cared to 
name — Henry was easy enough to 
take. Cherry even made a special 
point of asking Henry to keep 
them company through dinner, 
and she laughed as thoroughly as 
Morey himself at its droll anec- 
dotes. 

But later, in the conservatory, 
when Henry had considerately 
left them alone, the laughter 
dried up. 

Morey didn’t notice. He was 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



very conscientiously making the 
rounds: turning on the tri-D, se- 
lecting their after-dinner liqueurs, 
scanning the evening newspapers. 

Cherry cleared her throat self- 
consciously, and Morey stopped 
what he was doing. “Dear,” she 
said tentatively. “I’m feeling kind 
of restless tonight. Could we — I 
mean do you think we could just 
sort of stay home and — well, re- 
lax?” 

Morey looked at her with a 
touch of concern. She lay back 
wearily, eyes half closed. “Are 
you feeling all right?” he asked. 

“Perfectly. I just don’t want 
to go out tonight, dear. I don’t 
feel up to it.” 

He sat down and automatically 
lit a cigarette. “I see,” he said. 
The tri-D was beginning a com- 
edy show; he got up to turn it 
off, snapping on the tape-player. 
Muted strings filled the room. 

“We had reservations at the 
club tonight,” he reminded her. 

Cherry shifted uncomfortably. 
“I know.” 

“And we have the opera tickets 
that I turned last week’s in for. 
I hate to nag, darling, but we 
haven’t used any of our opera 
tickets.” 

“We can see them right here on 
the tri-D,” she said in a small 
voice. 

“That has nothing to do with 
it, sweetheart. I — I didn’t want to 
tell you about it, but Wainwright,

down at the office, said some- 
thing to me yesterday. He told 
me he would be at the circus last 
night and as much as said he’d be 
looking to see if we were there, 
too. Well, we weren’t there. 
Heaven knows what I’ll tell him 
next week.” 

He waited for Cherry to an- 
swer, but. she was silent. 

He went on reasonably, “So if 
you could see your way clear to 
going out tonight — ” 

He stopped, slack-jawed. Cher- 
ry was crying, silently and in 
quantity. 

“Darling!” he said inarticu- 
lately. 

He hurried to her, but she fend- 
ed him off. He stood helpless over 
her, watching her cry. 

“Dear, what’s the matter?” he 
asked. 

She turned her head away. 

11/TOREY rocked back on his 
heels. It wasn’t exactly the 
first time he’d seen Cherry cry — 
there had been that poignant scene 
when they Gave Each Other Up, 
realizing that their backgrounds 
were too far apart for happiness, 
before the realization that they 
had to have each other, no matter 
what . But it was the first 
time her tears had made him feel 
guilty. 

And he did feel guilty. He stood 
there staring at her. 

Then he turned his back on her 



and walked over to the bar. He 
ignored the ready liqueurs and 
poured two stiff highballs, 
brought them back to her. He set 
one down beside her, took a long 
drink from the other. 

In quite a different tone, he 
said, “Dear, what’s the matter ?” 
No answer. 

“Come on. What is it?” 

She looked up at him and 
rubbed at her eyes. Almost sul- 
lenly, she said, “Sorry.” 

“I know you’re sorry. Look, we 
love each other. Let’s talk this 
thing out.” 

She picked up her drink and 
held it for a moment, before 
setting it down untasted. “What’s 
the use, Morey?” 

“Please. Let’s try.” 

She shrugged. 

He went on remorselessly, 
“You aren’t happy, are you? And 
it’s because of — well, all this.” 
His gesture took in the richly 
furnished conservatory, the thick- 
piled carpet, the host of machines 
and contrivances for their com- 
fort and entertainment that wait- 
ed for their touch. By implication 
it took in twenty-six rooms, five 
cars, nine robots. Morey said, 
with an effort, “It isn’t what 
you’re used to, is it?” 

“I can’t help it,” Cherry said. 
“Morey, you know I’ve tried. But 
back home — ” 

“Dammit,” he flared, “ this is 
your home. You don’t live with 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



your father any more in that five- 
room cottage; you don’t spend 
your evenings hoeing the garden 
or playing cards for matchsticks. 
You live here, with me, your hus- 
band! You knew what you were 
getting into. We talked all this 
out long before we were mar- 
ried — ” 

The words stopped, because 
words were useless. Cherry was 
crying again, but not silently. 

Through her tears, she wailed: 
“Darling, I’ve tried. You don’t 
know how I’ve tried! I’ve worn 
all those silly clothes and I’ve 
played all those silly games and 
I’ve gone out with you as much 
as I possibly could and — I’ve 
eaten all that terrible food until 
I’m actually getting fa-fa -fat! I 
thought I could stand it. But I 
just can’t go on like this; I’m not 
used to it. I — I love you, Morey, 
but I’m going crazy, living like 
this. I can’t help it, Morey — I’m 
tired of being poor!” 

■EVENTUALLY the tears dried 
up, and the quarrel healed, 
and the lovers kissed and made 
up. But Morey lay awake that 
night, listening to his wife’s gentle 
breathing from the suite next to 
his own, staring into the darkness 
as tragically as any pauper be- 
fore him had ever done. 

Blessed are the poor, for they 
shall inherit the Earth. 

Blessed Morey, heir to more 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



worldly goods than he could pos- 
sibly consume. 

Morey Fry, steeped in grinding 
poverty, had never gone hungry 
a day in his life, never lacked 
for anything his heart could de- 
sire in the way of food, or cloth- 
ing, or a place to sleep. In 
Morey’s world, no one lacked for 
these things; no one could. 

Malthus was right — for a civi- 
lization without machines, auto- 
matic factories, hydroponics and 
food synthesis, nuclear breeder 
plants, ocean-mining for metals 
and minerals . 

And a vastly increasing supply 
of labor . 

And architecture that rose high 
in the air and dug deep in the 
ground and floated far out on the 
water on piers and pontoons . 
architecture that could be poured 
one day and lived in the next . 

And robots. 

Above all, robots . robots to 
burrow and haul and smelt and 
fabricate, to build and farm and 
weave and sew. 

What the land lacked in wealth, 
the sea was made to yield and the 
laboratory invented the rest . 
and the factories became a pipe- 
line of plenty, churning out 
enough to feed and clothe and 
house a dozen worlds. 

Limitless discovery, infinite 
power in the atom, tireless labor 
of humanity and robots, mech- 
anization that drove jungle and 

11 



swamp and ice off the Earth, and 
put up office buildings and manu- 
facturing centers and rocket ports 
in their place . 

The pipeline of production 
spewed out riches that no king in 
the time of Malthus could have 
known. 

But a pipeline has two ends. 
The invention and power and 
labor pouring in at one end must 
somehow be drained out at the 
other . 

Lucky Morey, blessed eco- 
nomic consuming unit, drowning 
in the pipeline’s flood, striving 
manfully to eat and drink and 
wear and wear out his share of 
the ceaseless tide of wealth. 

Morey felt far from blessed, 
for the blessings of the poor are 
always best appreciated from 
afar. 

Q UOTAS worried his sleep un- 
til he awoke at eight o’clock 
the next morning, red-eyed and 
haggard, but inwardly resolved. 
He had reached a decision. He 
was starting a new life. 

There was trouble in the morn- 
ing mail. Under the letterhead of 
the National Ration Board, it 
said: 

“We regret to advise you that 
the following items returned by 
you in connection with your Au- 
gust quotas as used and no longer 
serviceable have been inspected 
and found insufficiently worn.” 



The list followed — a long one, 
Morey saw to his sick disappoint- 
ment. “Credit is hereby disal- 
lowed for these and you are 
therefore given an additional 
consuming quota for the current 
month in the amount of 435 
points, at least 350 points of 
which must be in the textile and 
home-furnishing categories.” 

Morey dashed the letter to the 
floor. The valet picked it up 
emotionlessly, creased it and set 
it on his desk. 

It wasn’t fair! All right, maybe 
the bathing trunks and beach 
umbrellas hadn’t been really used 
very much — though how the 
devil, he asked himself bitterly, 
did you go about using up swim- 
ming gear when you didn’t have 
time for such leisurely pursuits 
as swimming? But certainly the 
hiking slacks were used! He’d 
worn them for three whole days 
and part of a fourth; what did 
they expect him to do, go around 
in rags? 

Morey looked belligerently at 
the coffee and toast that the 
valet-robot had brought in with 
the mail, and then steeled his 
resolve. Unfair or not, he had to 
play the game according to the 
rules. It was for Cherry, more 
than for himself, and the way to 
begin a new way of life was to 
begin it. 

Morey was going to consume 
for two. 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He told the valet-robot, ‘Take 
that stuff back. I want cream and 
sugar with the coffee — lots of 
cream and sugar. And besides the 
toast, scrambled eggs, fried pota- 
toes, orange juice — no, make it 
half a grapefruit. And orange 
juice, come to think of it.” 

“Right away, sir,” said the 
valet. “You won’t be having 
breakfast at nine then, will you, 
sir?” 

“I certainly will,” said Morey 
virtuously. “Double portions!” As 
the robot was closing the door, he 
called after it, “Butter and mar- 
malade with the toast!” 

TIE went to the bath; he had a 
full schedule and no time to 
waste. In the shower, he carefully 
sprayed himself with lather three 
times. When he had rinsed the 
soap off, he went through the 
whole assortment of taps in 
order: three lotions, plain talcum, 
scented talcum and thirty seconds 
of ultra-violet. Then he lathered 
and rinsed again, and dried him- 
self with a towel instead of using 
the hot-air drying jet. Most of 
the miscellaneous scents went 
down the drain with the rinse 
water, but if the Ration Board ac- 
cused him of waste, he could 
claim he was experimenting. The 
effect, as a matter of fact, wasn’t 
bad at all. 

He stepped out, full of exuber- 
ance. Cherry was awake, staring 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



in dismay at the tray the valet 
had brought. “Good morning, 
dear,” she said faintly. “Ugh.” 
Morey kissed her and patted 
her hand. “Well!” he said, look- 
ing at the tray with a big, hollow 
smile. “Food!” 

“Isn’t that a lot for just the two 
of us?” 

“Two of us?” repeated Morey 
masterfully. “Nonsense, my dear. 
I'm going to eat it all by myself!” 
“Oh, Morey!” gasped Cherry, 
and the adoring look she gave 
him was enough to pay for a 
dozen such meals. 

Which, he thought as he fin- 
ished his morning exercises with 
the sparring-robot and sat down 
to his real breakfast, it just about 
had to be, day in and day out, 
for a long, long time. 

Still, Morey had made up his 
mind. As he worked his way 
through the kippered herring, tea 
and crumpets, he ran over his 
plans with Henry. He swallowed 
a mouthful and said, “I want you 
to line up some appointments for 
me right away. Three hours a 
week in an exercise gym — pick 
one with lots of reducing equip- 
ment, Henry. I think I’m going to 
need it. And fittings for some new 
clothes — I’ve had these for weeks. 
And, let’s see, doctor, dentist — 
say, Henry, don’t I have a psy- 
chiatrist’s date coming up?” 
“Indeed you do, sir!” it said 
warmly. “This morning, in fact. 

13 



I’ve already instructed the chauf- 
feur apd notified your office.” 
“Fine! Well, get started on the 
other things, Henry.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Henry, and as- 
sumed the curious absent look 
of a robot talking on its TBR 
circuits — the “Talk Between Ro- 
bots” radio — as it arranged the 
appointments for its master. 

lV/|'OREY finished his breakfast 
in silence, pleased with his 
own virtue, at peace with the 
world. It wasn’t so hard to be 
a proper, industrious consumer if 
you worked at it, he reflected. It 
was only the malcontents, the 
ne’er-do-wells and the incompe- 
tents who simply could not ad- 
just to the world around them. 
Well, he thought with distant 
pity, someone had to suffer; you 
couldn’t break eggs without mak- 
ing an omelet. And his proper 
duty was not to be some sort of 
wild-eyed crank, challenging the 
social order and beating his 
breast about injustice, but to take 
care of his wife and his home. 

It was too bad he couldn’t 
really get right down to work on 
consuming today. But this was 
his one day a week to hold a job 
— four of the other six days were 
devoted to solid consuming — and, 
besides, he had a group therapy 
session scheduled as well. His 
analysis, Morey told himself, 
would certainly take a sharp turn 



for the better, now that he had 
faced up to his problems. 

Morey was immersed in a glow 
of self-righteousness as he kissed 
Cherry good-by (she had finally 
got up, all in a confusion of de- 
light at the new regime) and 
walked out the door to his car. 
He hardly noticed the little man 
in enormous floppy hat and gar- 
ishly ruffled trousers who was 
standing almost hidden in the 
shrubs. 

“Hey, Mac.” The man’s voice 
was almost a whisper. 

“Huh? Oh — what is it?” 

The man looked around fur- 
tively. “Listen, friend,” he said 
rapidly, “you look like an in- 
telligent man who could use a 
little help. Times are tough; you 
help me, I’ll help you. Want to 
make a deal on ration stamps? 
Six for one. One of yours for six 
of mine, the best deal you’ll get 
anywhere in town. Naturally, my 
stamps aren’t exactly the real 
McCoy, but they’ll pass, friend, 
they’ll pass — ” 

Morey blinked at him. “No!” 
he said violently, and pushed the 
man aside. Now it’s racketeers, 
he thought bitterly. Slums and 
endless sordid preoccupation with 
rations weren’t enough to inflict 
on Cherry; now the neighborhood 
was becoming a hangout for peo- 
ple on the shady side of the law. 
It was not, of course, the first 
time he had ever been approached 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



by a counterfeit ration -stamp 
hoodlum, but never at his own 
front door! 

Morey thought briefly, as he 
climbed into his car, of calling the 
police. But certainly the man 
would be gone before they could 
get there; and, after all, he had 
handled it pretty well as it was. 

Of course, it would be nice to 
get six stamps for one. 

But very far from nice if he got 
caught. 

OOD morning, Mr. Fry,” 
tinkled the robot reception- 
ist. “Won’t you go right in?” 
With a steel-tipped finger, it 
pointed to the door marked 

GROUP THERAPY. 

Someday, Morey vowed to 
himself as he nodded and com- 
plied, he would be in a position 
to afford a private analyst of his 
own. Group therapy helped re- 
lieve the infinite stresses of mod- 
ern living, and without it he 
might find himself as badly off 
as the hysterical mobs in the ra- 
tion riots, or as dangerously anti- 
social as the counterfeiters. But it 
lacked the personal touch. It was, 
he thought, too public a perform- 
ance of what should be a private 
affair, like trying to live a happy 
married life with an interfering, 
ever-present crowd of robots in 
the house — 

Morey brought himself up in 
panic. How had that thought 



crept in? He was shaken visibly 
as he entered the room and greet- 
ed the group to which he was 
assigned. 

There were eleven of them: 
four Freudians, two Reichians, 
two Jungians, a Gestalter, a 
shock therapist and the elderly 
and rather quiet Sullivanite. 
Even the members of the majority 
groups had their own individual 
differences in technique and 
creed, but, despite four years 
with this particular group of 
analysts, Morey hadn’t quite 
been able to keep them separate 
in his mind. Their names, though, 
he knew well enough. 

“Morning, Doctors,” he said. 
“What is it today?” 

“Morning,” said Semmelweiss 
morosely. “Today you come into 
the room for the first time look- 
ing as if something is really both- 
ering you, and yet the schedule 
calls for psychodrama. Dr. Fair- 
less,” he appealed, “can’t we 
change the schedule a little bit? 
Fry here is obviously under a 
strain; that’s the time to start 
digging and see what he can find. 
We can do your psychodrama 
next time, can’t we?” 

Fairless shook his gracefully 
bald old head. “Sorry, Doctor. 
If it were up to me, of course — 
but you know the rules.” 

“Rules, rules,” jeered Semmel- 
weiss. “Ah, what’s the use? Here’s 
a patient in an acute anxiety state 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE

if I ever saw one — and believe me, 
I saw plenty — and we ignore it 
because the rules say ignore it. Is 
that professional? Is that how to 
cure a patient?” 

Little Blaine said frostily, “If 
I may say so, Dr. Semmelweiss, 
there have been a great many 
cures made without the necessity 
of departing from the rules. I my- 
self, in fact — ” 

“You yourself!” mimicked 
Semmelweiss. “You yourself 
never handled a patient alone in 
your life. When you going to get 
out of a group, Blaine?” 

Blaine said furiously, “Dr. 
Fairless, I don’t think I have to 
stand for this sort of personal 
attack. Just because Semmel- 
weiss has seniority and a couple 
of private patients one day a 
week, he thinks — ” 

“Gentlemen,” said Fairless 
mildly. “Please, let’s get on with 
the work. Mr. Fry has come to us 
for help, not to listen to us losing 
our tempers.” 

“Sorry,” said Semmelweiss 
curtly. “All the same, I appeal 
from the arbitrary and mechanis- 
tic ruling of the chair.” 

Fairless inclined his head. “All 
in favor of the ruling of the chair? 
Nine, I count. That leaves only 
you opposed, Dr. Semmelweiss. 
We’ll proceed with the psycho- 
drama, if the recorder will read us 
the notes and comments of the 
last session.” 



T^HE recorder, a pudgy, low- 
ranking youngster named 
Sprogue, flipped back the pages 
of his notebook and read in a 
chanting voice, “Session of 24 
May, subject, Morey Fry; in at- 
tendence, Doctors Fairless, Bileck, 
Semmelweiss, Carrado, Weber — ” 

Fairless interrupted kindly, 
“Just the last page, if you please, 
Dr. Sprogue.” 

“Um — oh, yes. After a ten- 
minute recess for additional 
Rorschachs and an electro-en- 
cephalogram, the group convened 
and conducted rapid-fire word as- 
sociation. Results were tabulated 
and compared with standard de- 
viation patterns, and it was de- 
termined that subject’s major 
traumas derived from, respec- 
tively — ” 

Morey found his attention wan- 
ing. Therapy was good; every- 
body knew that, but every once 
in a while he found it a little 
dull. If it weren’t for therapy, 
though, there was no telling what 
might happen. Certainly, Morey 
told himself, he had been helped 
considerably — at least he hadn’t 
set fire to his house and shrieked 
at the fire-robots, like Newell 
down the block when his eldest 
daughter divorced her husband 
and came back to live with him, 
bringing her ration quota along, 
of course. Morey hadn’t even 
been tempted to do anything as 
outrageously, frighteningly im- 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



moral as destroy things or waste 
them — well, he admitted to him- 
self honestly, perhaps a little 
tempted, once in a great while. 
But never anything important 
enough to worry about; he was 
sound, perfectly sound. 

He looked up, startled. All the 
doctors were staring at him. “Mr. 
Fry,” Fairless repeated, “will you 
take your place?” 

“Certainly,” Morey said hasti- 
ly. “Uh — where?” 

Semmelweiss guffawed. “ Told 
you. Never mind, Morey; you 
didn’t miss much. We’re going 
to run through one of the big 
scenes in your life, the one you 
told us about last time. Remem- 
ber? You were fourteen years old, 
you said. Christmas time. Your 
mother had made you a promise.” 
Morey swallowed. “I remem- 
ber,” he said unhappily. “Well, 
all right. Where do I stand?” 
“Right here,” said Fairless. 
“You’re you, Carrado is your 
mother, I’m your father. Will the 
doctors not participating mind 
moving back? Fine. Now, Morey, 
here we are on Christmas morn- 
ing. Merry Christmas, Morey!” 
“Merry Christmas,” Morey said 
half-heartedly. “Uh — F ather dear, 
where’s my — uh — my puppy that 
Mother promised me?” 

“Puppy!” said Fairless hearti- 
ly. “Your mother and I have 
something much better than a 
puppy for you. Just take a look 



under the tree there — it’s a robot! 
Yes, Morey, your very own robot 
— a full-size 38-tube fully auto- 
matic companion robot for you! 
Go ahead, Morey, go right up 
and speak to it. Its name is 
Henry. Go on, boy.” 

Morey felt a sudden, incom- 
prehensible tingle inside the 
bridge of his nose. He said shaki- 
ly, “But I — I didn’t want a ro- 
bot.” 

“Of course you want a robot,” 
Carrado interrupted. “Go on, 
child, play with your nice robot.” 
Morey said violently, “I hate 
robots!” He looked around him 
at the doctors, at the gray- 
paneled consulting room. He add- 
ed defiantly, "You hear me, all 
of you? I still hate robots!” 

There was a second’s pause; 
then the questions began. 

It was half an hour before the 
receptionist came in and an- 
nounced that time was up. 

In that half hour, Morey had 
got over his trembling and lost 
his wild, momentary passion, but 
he had remembered what for 
thirteen years he had forgotten. 
He hated robots. 

^THE surprising thing was not 
that young Morey had hated 
robots. It was that the Robot 
Riots, the ultimate violent out- 
break of flesh against metal, the 
battle to the death between man- 
kind and its machine heirs . 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



17 



never happened. A little boy 
hated robots, but the man he be- 
came worked with them hand in 
hand. 

And yet, always and always be- 
fore, the new worker, the com- 
petitor for the job, was at once 
and inevitably outside the law. 
The waves swelled in — the Irish, 
the Negroes, the Jews, the Ital- 
ians. They were squeezed into 
their ghettoes, where they encyst- 
ed, seethed and struck out, until 
the burgeoning generations be- 
came indistinguishable. 

For the robots, that genetic re- 
lief was not in sight. And still 
the conflict never came. The feed- 
back circuits aimed the anti-air- 
craft guns and, reshaped and 
newly planned, found a place in 
a new sort of machine — together 
with a miraculous trail of cams 
and levers, an indestructible and 
potent power source and a hun- 
dred thousand parts and sub- 
assemblies. 

And the first robot clanked off 
the bench. 

Its mission was its own destruc- 
tion; but from the scavenged 
wreck of its pilot body, a hundred 
better robots drew their inspira- 
tion. And the hundred went to 
work, and hundreds more, until 
there were millions upon untold 
millions. 

And still the riots never hap- 
pened. 

For the robots came bearing a 



gift and the name of it was 
“Plenty.” 

And by the time the gift had 
shown its own unguessed ills, the 
time for a Robot Riot was past. 
Plenty is a habit-forming drug. 
You do not cut the dosage down. 
You kick it if you can; you 
stop the dose entirely. But the 
convulsions that follow may 
wreck the body once and for all. 

The addict craves the grainy 
white powder; he doesn’t hate it, 
or the runner who sells it to him. 
And if Morey as a little boy 
could hate the robot that had de- 
prived him of his pup, Morey 
the man was perfectly aware that 
the robots were his servants and 
his friends. 

But the little Morey inside the 
man — he had never been con- 
vinced. 

M OREY ordinarily looked for- 
ward to his work. The one 
day a week at which he did any- 
thing was a wonderful change 
from the dreary consume, con- 
sume, consume grind. He entered 
the bright-lit drafting room of 
the Bradmoor Amusements Com- 
pany with a feeling of uplift. 

But as he was changing from 
street garb to his drafting smock, 
Howland from Procurement came 
over with a knowing look. “Wain- 
wright’s been looking for you,” 
Howland whispered. “Better get 
right in there.” 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Morey nervously thanked him 
and got. Wainwright’s office was 
the size of a phone booth and as 
bare as Antarctic ice. Every time 
Morey saw it, he felt his insides 
churn with envy. Think of a desk 
with nothing on it but work 
surface — no calendar-clock, no 
twelve-color pen rack, no dictat- 
ing machines! 

He squeezed himself in and sat 
down while Wainwright finished 
a phone call. He mentally re- 
viewed the possible reasons why 
Wainwright would want to talk 
to him in person instead of over 
the phone, or by dropping a word 
to him as he passed through the 
drafting room. 

Very few of them were good. 

Wainwright put down the 
phone and Morey straightened 
up. “You sent for me?” he asked. 

Wainwright in a chubby world 
was aristocratically lean. As Gen- 
eral Superintendent of the De- 
sign & Development Section of 
the Bradmoor Amusements Com- 
pany, he ranked high in the 
upper section of the well-to-do. 
He rasped, “I certainly did. Fry, 
just what the hell do you think 
you’re up to now?” 

“I don’t know what you 
m-mean, Mr. Wainwright,” Mor- 
ey stammered, crossing off the 
list of possible reasons for the 
interview all of the good ones. 

Wainwright snorted. “I guess 
you don’t. Not because you 



weren’t told, but because you 
don’t want to know. Think back 
a whole week. What did I have 
you on the carpet for then?” 

Morey said sickly, “My ration 
book. Look, Mr. Wainwright, I 
know I’m running a little bit be- 
hind, but — ” 

“But nothing! How do you 
think it looks to the Committee, 
Fry? They got a complaint from 
the Ration Board about you. Nat- 
urally they passed it on to me. 
And naturally I’m going to pass 
it right along to you. The ques- 
tion is, what are you going to do 
about it? Good God, man, look at 
these figures — textiles, fifty-one 
per cent; food, sixty-seven per 
cent; amusements and entertain- 
ment, thirty per cent! You haven’t 
come up to your ration in any- 
thing for months!” 

Morey stared at the card mis- 
erably; “We — that is, my wife 
and I — just had a long talk about 
that last night, Mr. Wainwright. 
And, believe me, we’re going to 
do better. We’re going to buckle 
right down and get to work and — 
uh — do better,” he finished weak- 
ly- 

Wainwright nodded, and for 
the first time there was a note 
of sympathy. in his voice. “Your 
wife. Judge Elon’s daughter, isn’t 
she? Good family. I’ve met the 
Judge many times.” Then, gruff- 
ly, “Well, nevertheless, Fry, I’m 
warning you. I don’t care how 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



19 



you straighten this out, but don’t 
Jet the Committee mention this 
to me again.” 

“No, sir.” 

“All right. Finished with the 
schematics on the new K-50?” 

Morey brightened. “Just about, 
sir! I’m putting the first section 
on tape today. I’m very pleased 
with it, Mr. Wainwright, honestly 
I am. I’ve got more than eighteen 
thousand moving parts in it now, 
and that’s without — ” 

“Good. Good.” Wainwright 
glanced down at his desk. “Get 
back to it. And straighten out this 
other thing. You can do it, Fry. 
Consuming is everybody’s duty. 
Just keep that in mind.” 

TT OWL AND followed Morey 
•*■■■- out of the drafting room, 
down to the spotless shops. “Bad 
time?” he inquired solicitously. 
Morey grunted. It was none of 
Howland’s business. 

Howland looked over his shoul- 
der as he was setting up the 
programing panel. Morey studied 
the matrices silently, then got 
busy reading the summary tapes, 
checking them back against the 
schematics, setting up the instruc- 
tions on the programing board. 
Howland kept quiet as Morey 
completed the setup and ran off 
a test tape. It checked perfectly; 
Morey stepped back to light a 
cigarette in celebration before 
pushing the start button. 



Howland said, “Go on, run it. 
I can’t go until you put it in 
the works.” 

Morey grinned and pushed the 
button. The board lighted up; 
within it, a tiny metronomic beep 
began to pulse. That was all. At 
the other end of the quarter-mile 
shed, Morey knew, the automatic 
sorters and conveyers were finger- 
ing through the copper reels and 
steel ingots, measuring hoppers 
of plastic powder and colors, set- 
ting up an intricate weaving path 
for the thousands of individual 
components that would make up 
Bradmoor’s new K-50 Spin-a- 
Game. But from where they 
stood, in the elaborately muraled 
programing room, nothing show- 
ed. Bradmoor was an ultra- 
modernized plant; in the manu- 
facturing end, even robots had 
been dispensed with in favor of 
machines that guided themselves. 

Morey glanced at his watch 
and logged in the starting time 
while Howland quickly counter- 
checked Morey’s raw-material 
flow program. 

“Checks out,” Howland said 
solemnly, slapping him on the 
back. “Calls for a celebration. 
Anyway, it’s your first design, 
isn’t it?” 

“Yes. First all by myself, at 
any rate.” 

Howland was already fishing 
in his private locker for the bottle 
he kept against emergency needs.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







He poured with a flourish. “To 
Morey Fry,” he said, “our most 
favorite designer, in whom we 
are much pleased.” 

Morey drank. It went down 
easily enough. Morey had con- 
scientiously used his liquor ra- 
tions for years, but he had never 
gone beyond the minimum, so 
that although liquor was no new 
experience to him, the single drink 
immediately warmed him. It 
warmed his mouth, his throat, 
the hollows of his chest; and it 
settled down with a warm glow 
inside him. Howland, exerting 
himself to be nice, complimented 
Morey fatuously on the design 
and poured another drink. Morey 



didn’t utter any protest at all. 

Howland drained his glass. 
“You may wonder^’ he said 
formally, “why I am so pleased 
with you, Morey Fry. I will tell 
you why this is.” 

Morey grinned. “Please do.” 
Howland nodded. “I will. It’s 
because I am pleased with the 
world, Morey. My wife left me 
last night.” 

Tl/IOREY was as shocked as 
only a recent bridegroom 
can be by the news of a crum- 
bling marriage. “That’s too ba — I 
mean is that a fact?” 

“Yes, she left my beds and 
board and five robots, and I’m 



THE MIDAS FLAG UE

happy to see her go.” He poured 
another drink for both of them. 
“Women. Can’t live with them 
and can't live without them. 
First you sigh and pant and 
chase after ’em — you like po- 
etry?” he demanded suddenly. 

Morey said cautiously, “Some 
poetry.” 

Howland quoted : “ ‘How long, 
my love, shall I behold this wall 
between our gardens — yours the 
rose, and mine the swooning lily.’ 
Like it? I wrote it for Jocelyn — 
that’s my wife — when we were 
first going together.” 

“It’s beautiful,” said Morey. 

“She wouldn’t talk to me for 
two' days.” Howland drained his 
drink. “Lots of spirit, that girl. 
Anyway, I hunted her like a 
tiger. And then I caught her. 
Wow!" 

Morey took a deep drink from 
his own glass. "What do you 
mean, wow ?” he asked. 

"Wow.” Howland pointed his 
finger at Morey. “Wow, that’s 
what I mean. We got married 
and I took her home to the dive 
I was living in, and wow we had 
a kid, and wow I got in a little 
trouble with the Ration Board — 
nothing serious, of course, but 
there was a mixup— and wow 
fights. 

“Everything was a fight,” he 
explained. “She’d start with a 
little nagging, and naturally I’d 
say something or other back, and 



bang we were off. Budget, budget, 
budget; I hope to die if I ever 
hear the word ‘budget’ again. 
Morey, you’re a married man; 
you know what it’s like. Tell me 
the truth, weren’t you just about 
ready to blow your top the first 
time you caught your wife cheat- 
ing on the budget?” 

“Cheating on the budget?” 
Morey was startled. “Cheating 
how?” 

“Oh, lots of ways. Making your 
portions bigger than hers. Sneak- 
ing extra shirts for you on her 
clothing ration. You know.” 
“Damn it, I do not know!” 
cried Morey. “Cherry wouldn’t 
do anything like that!” 

Howland looked at him 
opaquely for a long second. “Of 
course not,” he said at last. “Let’s 
have another drink.” 

Ruffled, Morey held out his 
glass. Cherry wasn’t the type of 
girl to cheat. Of course she wasn’t. 
A fine, loving girl like her — a 
pretty girl, of a good family; she 
wouldn’t know how to begin. 

H OWLAND was saying, in a 
sort of chant, “No more 
budget. No more fights. No more 
‘Daddy never treated me like 
this.’ No more nagging. No more 
extra rations for household al- 
lowance. No more — Morey, what 
do you say we go out and have 
a few drinks? I know a place 
where — ”

“Sorry, Howland,” Morey said. 
“I’ve got to get back to the 
office, you know.” 

Howland guffawed. He held out 
his wristwatch. As Morey, a little 
unsteadily, bent over it, it tinkled 
out the hour. It was a matter of 
minutes before the office closed 
for the day. 

“Oh,” said Morey. “I didn’t 
realize — Well, anyway, Howland, 
thanks, but I can’t. My wife will 
be expecting me.” 

“She certainly will,” Howland 
sniggered. “Won’t catch her eat- 
ing up your rations and hers to- 
night.” 

Morey said tightly, “How- 
land!” 

“Oh, sorry, sorry.” Howland 
waved an arm. “Don’t mean to 
say anything against your wife, 
of course. Guess maybe Jocelyn 
soured me on women. But honest, 
Morey, you’d like this place. 
Name of Uncle Piggotty’s, down 
in the Old Town. Crazy bunch 
hangs out there. You’d like them. 
Couple nights last week they 
had — I mean, you understand, 
Morey, I don’t go there as often 
as all that, but I just happened 
to drop in and — ” 

Morey interrupted firmly. 
“Thank you, Howland. Must go 
home. Wife expects it. Decent 
of you to offer. Good night. Be 
seeing you.” 

He walked out, turned at the 
door to bow politely, and in turn- 



ing back cracked the side of his 
face against the door jamb. A sort 
of pleasant numbness had taken 
possession of his entire skin sur- 
face, though, and it wasn’t until 
he perceived Henry chattering at 
him sympathetically that he no- 
ticed a trickle of blood' running 
down the side of his face. 

“Mere flesh wound,” he said 
with dignity. “Nothing to cause 
you least conshter — consterna- 
tion, Henry. Now kindly shut 
your ugly face. Want to think.” 

And he slept in the car all the 
way home. 

IT was worse than a hangover. 

The name is “holdover.” 
You’ve had some drinks; you’ve 
started to sober up by catching 
a little sleep. Then you are re- 
quired to be awake and to func- 
tion. The consequent state has the 
worst features of hangover and 
intoxication; your head thumps 
and your mouth tastes like the 
floor of a bear-pit, but you are 
nowhere near sober. 

There is one cure. Morey said 
thickly, “Let’s have a cocktail, 
dear.” 

Cherry was delighted to share 
a cocktail with him before dinner. 
Cherry, Morey thought lovingly, 
was a wonderful, wonderful, 
wonderful — 

He found his head nodding in 
time to his thoughts and the 
motion made him wince.

Cherry flew to his side and 
touched his temple. “Is it bother- 
ing you, darling?” she asked so- 
licitously. “Where you ran into 
the door, I mean?” 

• Morey looked at her sharply, 
but her expression was open and 
adoring. He said bravely, “Just 
a little. Nothing to it, really.” 
The butler brought the cock- 
tails and retired. Cherry lifted 
her glass. Morey raised his, 
caught a whiff of the liquor and 
nearly dropped it. He bit down 
hard on his churning insides and 
forced himself to swallow. 

He was surprised but grateful: 
It stayed down. In a moment, 
the curious phenomenon of 
warmth began to repeat itself. 
He swallowed the rest of the 
drink and held out his glass for a 
refill. He even tried a smile. Oddly 
enough, his face didn’t fall off. 

i"|NE more drink did it. Morey 
felt happy and relaxed, 
but by no means drunk. They 
went in to dinner in fine spirits. 
They chatted cheerfully with 
each other and Henry, and Morey 
found time to feel sentimentally 
sorry for poor Howland, who 
couldn’t make a go of his mar- 
riage, when marriage was ob- 
viously such an easy relationship, 
so beneficial to both sides, so 
warm and relaxing . 

Startled, he said, “What?” 
Cherry repeated, “It’s the clev- 



erest scheme I ever heard of. Such 
a funny little man, dear. All kind 
of nervous, if you know what I 
mean. He kept looking at the 
door as if he was expecting some- 
one, but of course that was silly. 
None of his friends would have 
come to our house to see him.” 
Morey said tensely, “Cherry, 
please! What was that you said 
about ration stamps?” 

“But I told you, darling! It 
was just after you left this morn- 
ing. This funny little man came 
to the door; the butler said he 
wouldn’t give any name. Any- 
way, I talked to him. I thought 
he might be a neighbor and I 
certainly would never be rude to 
any neighbor who might come to 
call, even if the neighborhood 
was — ” 

“The ration stamps!” Morey 
begged. “Did I hear you say 
he was peddling phony ration 
stamps?” 

Cherry said uncertainly, “Well, 
I suppose that in a way they’re 
phony. The way he explained it, 
they weren’t the regular official 
kind. But it was four for one, 
dear — four of his stamps for one 
of ours. So I just took out our 
household book and steamed off 
a couple of weeks’ stamps and — ” 
“How many?” Morey bel- 
lowed. 

Cherry blinked. “About — about 
two weeks’ quota,” she said faint- 
ly. “Was that wrong, dear?” 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



11M OREY closed his eyes dizzily. 
It J. couple of weeks’ stamps,” 

he repeated. “Four for one — you 
didn’t even get the regular rate.” 

Cherry wailed, “How was I 
supposed to know? I never had 
anything like this when I was 
home! We didn’t have food riots 
and slums and all these horrible 
robots and filthy little revolting 
men coming to the door!” 

Morey stared at her woodenly. 
She was crying again, but it made 
no impression on the case-hard- 
ened armor that was suddenly 
thrown around his heart. 

Henry made a tentative sound 
that, in a human, would have 
been a preparatory cough, but 
Morey froze him with a white- 
eyed look. 

Morey said in a dreary mono- 
tone that barely penetrated the 
sound of Cherry’s tears, “Let me 
tell you just what it was you did. 
Assuming, at best, that these 
stamps you got are at least aver- 
age good counterfeits, and not so 
bad that the best thing to do with 
them is throw them away before 
we get caught with them in our 
possession, you have approxi- 
mately a two -month supply of 
funny stamps. In case you didn’t 
know it, those ration books are 
not merely ornamental. They 
have to be turned in every month 
to prove that we have completed 
our consuming quota for the 
month. 

« 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



“When they are turned in, they 
are spot-checked. Every book is 
at least glanced at. A big chunk 
of them are gone over very care- 
fully by the inspectors, and a cer- 
tain percentage are tested by 
ultra-violet, infra-red, X-ray, 
radioisotopes, bleaches, fumes, 
paper chromatography and every 
other damned test known to 
Man.” His voice was rising to an 
uneven crescendo. “If we are 
lucky enough to get away with 
using any of these stamps at all, 
we daren’t — we simply dare not — 
use more than one or two counter- 
feits to every dozen or more real 
stamps. 

“That means, Cherry, that 
what you bought is not a two- 
month supply, but maybe a two- 
year supply — and since, as you 
no doubt have never noticed, the 
things have expiration dates on 
them, there is probably no chance 
in the world that we can ever 
hope to use more than half of 
them.” He was bellowing by the 
time he pushed back his chair 
and towered over her. “More- 
over,” he went on, “right now, 
right as of this minute, we have 
to make up the stamps you gave 
away, which means that at the 
very best we are going to be on 
double rations for two weeks or 
so. 

“And that says nothing about 
the one feature of this whole 
grisly mess that you seem to have 

25 



thought of least, namely that 
counterfeit stamps are against 
the law! I’m poor, Cherry; I live 
in a slum, and I know it; I’ve 
got a long way to go before I’m 
as rich or respected or powerful 
as your father, about whom I am 
beginning to get considerably 
tired of hearing. But poor as I 
may be, I can tell you this for 
sure : Up until now, at any rate, I 
have been honest.” 

Cherry’s tears had stopped en- 
tirely and she was bowed white- 
faced and dry-eyed by the time 
Morey had finished. He had spent 
himself; there was no violence 
left in him. 

He stared dismally at Cherry 
for a moment, then turned word- 
lessly and stamped out of the 
house. 

Marriage! he thought as he left. 

¥TE walked for hours, blind to 
where he was going. 

What brought him back to 
awareness was a sensation he had 
not felt in a dozen years. It was 
not, Morey abruptly realized, 
the dying traces of his hangover 
that made his stomach feel so 
queer. He was hungry — actually 
hungry. 

He looked about him. He was 
in the Old Town, miles from 
home, jostled by crowds of lower- 
class people. The block he was on 
was as atrocious a slum as Morey 
had ever seen — Chinese pagodas 



stood next to rococo imitations of 
the chapels around Versailles; 
gingerbread marred every facade; 
no building was without its bril- 
liant signs and flarelights. 

He saw a blindingly over- 
decorated eating establishment 
called Billie’s Budget Busy Bee 
and crossed the street toward it, 
dodging through the unending 
streams of traffic. It was a miser- 
able excuse for a restaurant, but 
Morey was in no mood to care. 
He found a seat under a potted 
palm, as far from the tinkling 
fountains and robot string en- 
semble as he could manage, and 
ordered recklessly, paying no at- 
tention to the ration prices. As 
the waiter was gliding noiselessly 
away, Morey had a sickening rea- 
lization: He’d come out without 
his ration book. He groaned out 
loud; it was too late to leave 
without causing a disturbance. 
But then, he thought rebelliously, 
what difference did one more un- 
rationed meal make, anyhow? 

Food made him feel a little 
better. He finished the last of 
his profiterole au chocolate, not 
even leaving on the plate the 
uneaten one -third that tradition 
permitted, and paid his check. 
The robot cashier reached auto- 
matically for his ration book. 
Morey had a moment of grandeur 
as he said simply, “No ration 
stamps.” 

Robot cashiers are not equipped 



26

to display surprise, but this one 
tried. The man behind Morey in 
line audibly caught his breath, 
and less audibly mumbled some- 
thing about slummers. Morey 
took it as a compliment and 
strode outside feeling almost in 
good humor. 

Good enough to go home to 
Cherry? Morey thought seriously 
of it for a second; but he wasn’t 
going to pretend he was wrong 
and certainly Cherry wasn’t go- 
ing to be willing to admit that 
she was at fault. 

Besides, Morey told himself 
grimly, she was undoubtedly 
asleep. That was an annoying 
thing about Cherry at best: she 
never had any trouble getting to 
sleep. Didn’t even use her quota 
of sleeping tablets, though Morey 
had spoken to her about it more 
than once. Of course, he remind- 
ed himself, he had been so polite 
and tactful about it, as befits a 
newlywed, that very likely she 
hadn’t even understood that it 
was a complaint. Well, that 
would stop! 

Man’s man Morey Fry, wear- 
ing no collar ruff but his own, 
strode determinedly down the 
streets of the Old Town. 

“TTEY, Joe, want a good time?” 
Morey took one unbeliev- 
ing look. “You again!” he roared. 

The little man stared at him in 
genuine surprise. Then a faint 

THE MIDAS PLAOUE 



glimmer of recognition crossed 
his face. “Oh, yeah,” he said. 
“This morning, huh?” He clucked 
commiseratingly. “Too bad you 
wouldn’t deal with me. Your wife 
was a lot smarter. Of course, you 
got me a little sore, Jack, so 
naturally I had to raise the price 
a little bit.” 

“You skunk, you cheated my 
poor wife blind! You and I are 
going to the local station house 
and talk this over.” 

The little man pursed his lips. 
“We are, huh?” 

Morey nodded vigorously. 
“Damn right! And let me tell 
you — ” He stopped in the middle 
of a threat as a large hand cupped 
around his shoulder. 

The equally large man who 
owned the hand said, in a mild 
and cultured voice, “Is this gen- 
tleman disturbing you, Sam?” 
“Not so far,” the little man 
conceded. “He might want to, 
though, so don’t go away.” 
Morey wrenched his shoulder 
away. “Don’t think you can 
strongarm me. I’m taking you to 
the police.” 

Sam shook his head unbe- 
lievingly. “You mean you’re go- 
ing to call the law in on this?” 

“I certainly am!” 

Sam sighed regretfully. “What 
do you think of that, Walter? 
Treating his wife like that. Such 
a nice lady, too.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

27 



Morey demanded, stung on a 
peculiarly sensitive spot. 

“I’m talking about your wife,” 
Sam explained. “Of course, I’m 
not married myseif. But it seems 
to me that if I was, I wouldn’t 
call the police when my wife was 
engaged in some kind of criminal 
activity or other. No, sir, I’d try 
to settle it myself. Tell you what,” 
he advised, “why don’t you talk 
this over with her? Make her see 
the error of — ” 

“Wait a minute,” Morey in- 
terrupted. “You mean you’d in- 
volve my wife in this thing?” 

The man spread his hands 
helplessly. “It’s not me that 
would involve her, Buster,” he 
said. “She already involved her 
own self. It takes two to make a 
crime, you know. I sell, maybe; 
I won’t deny it. But after all, I 
can’t sell unless somebody buys, 
can I ?” 

Morey stared at him glumly. 
He glanced in quick speculation 
at the large-sized Walter; but 
Walter was just as big as he’d 
remembered, so that took care 
of that. Violence was out; the 
police were out; that left no 
really attractive way of capi- 
talizing on the good luck of run- 
ning into the man again. 

S AM said, “Well, I’m glad to 
see that’s off your mind. Now, 
returning to my original ques- 
tion, Mac, how would you like 



a good time? You look like a 
smart fellow to me; you look like 
you’d be kind of interested in a 
place I happen to know of down 
the block.” 

Morey said bitterly, “So you’re 
a dive-steerer, too. A real tal- 
ented man.” 

“I admit it,” Sam agreed. 
“Stamp business is slow at night, 
in my experience. People have 
their minds more on a good time. 
And, believe me, a good time is 
what I can show ’em. Take this 
place I’m talking about, Uncle 
Piggotty’s is the .iame of it, it’s 
what I would call an unusual 
kind of place. Wouldn’t you say 
so, Walter?” 

“Oh, I agree with you entire- 
ly,” Walter rumbled. 

But Morey was hardly listen- 
ing. He said, “Uncle Piggotty’s, 
you say?” 

“That’s right,” said Sam. 

Morey frowned for a moment, 
digesting an idea. Uncle Piggot- 
ty’s sounded like the place How- 
land had been talking about back 
at the plant; it might be interest- 
ing, at that. 

While he was making up his 
mind, Sam slipped an arm 
through his on one side and 
Walter amiably wrapped a big 
hand around the other. Morey 
found himself walking. 

“You’ll like it,” Sam prom- 
ised comfortably. “No hard feel- 
ings about this morning, sport? 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Of course not. Once you get a 
look at Piggotty’s, you’ll get over 
your mad, anyhow. It’s some- 
thing special. I swear, on what 
they pay me for bringing in cus- 
tomers, I wouldn’t do it unless I 
believed in it.” 

“Dance, Jack?” the hostess 
yelled over the noise at the bar. 
She stepped back, lifted her 
flounced skirts to ankle height 
and executed a tricky nine-step. 

"My name is Morey,” Morey 
yelled back. “And I don’t want 
to dance, thanks.” 

The hostess shrugged, frowned 
meaningfully at Sam and danced 
away. 

Sam flagged the bartender. 
“First round’s on us,” he ex- 
plained to Morey. “Then we 
won’t bother you any more. Un- 
less you want us to, of course. 
Like the place?” Morey hesitated, 
but Sam didn’t wait. “Fine 
place,” he yelled, and picked up 
the drink the bartender left him. 
“See you around.” 

He and the big man were gone. 
Morey stared after them uncer- 
tainly, then gave it up. He was 
here, anyhow; might as well at 
least have a drink. He ordered 
and looked around. 

U NCLE PIGGOTTY’S was a 
third-rate dive disguised to 
look, in parts of it at least, like 
one of the exclusive upper-class 
country clubs. The bar, for in- 



stance, was treated to resemble 
the clean lines of nailed wood; 
but underneath the surface treat- 
ment, Morey could detect the in- 
tricate laminations of plyplastic. 
What at first glance appeared to 
be burlap hangings were in ac- 
tuality elaborately textured syn- 
thetics. And all through the bar 
the motif was carried out. 

A floor show of sorts was going 
on, but nobody seemed to be 
paying much attention to it. 
Morey, straining briefly to hear 
the master of ceremonies, gath- 
ered that the wit was on a more 
than mildly vulgar level. There 
•was a dispirited string of chorus 
beauties in long ruffled panta- 
loons and diaphanous tops; one 
of them, Morey was almost sure, 
was the hostess who had talked 
to him just a few moments be- 
fore. 

Next to him a man was de- 
claiming to a middle-aged wo- 
man: 

“Smote I the monstrous rock, yahoo! 

Smote I the turgid tube. Bully Boy! 

Smote I the cankered hill — 

Why, Morey!” he interrupted 
himself. “What are you doing 
here?” 

He turned farther around and 
Morey recognized him. “Hello, 
Howland,” he said. “I — uh — I 
happened to be free tonight, so 
I thought — ” 

Howland sniggered. “Well, 



TH E MIDAS PLAGUE 



29 



guess your wife is more liberal 
than mine was. Order a drink, 
boy.” 

“Thanks, I’ve got one,” said 
Morey. 

The woman, with a tigerish 
look at Morey, said, “Don’t stop, 
Everett. That was one of your 
most beautiful things.” 

“Oh, Morey’s heard my po- 
etry,” Howland said. “Morey, I’d 
like you to meet a very lovely 
and talented young lady, Tana- 
quil Bigelow. Morey works in 
the office with me, Tan.” 

“Obviously,” said Tanaquil 
Bigelow in a frozen voice, and 
Morey hastily withdrew the hand 
he had begun to put out. 

The conversation stuck there, 
impaled, the woman cold, How- 
land relaxed and abstracted, 
Morey wondering if, after all, 
this had been such a good idea. 
He caught the eye-cell of the 
robot bartender and ordered a 
round of drinks for the three of 
them, politely putting them on 
Howland’s ration book. By the 
time the drinks had come and 
Morey had just got around to 
deciding that it wasn’t a very 
good idea, the woman had all of 
a sudden become thawed. 

She said abruptly, “You look 
like the kind of man who thinks, 
Morey, and I like to talk to that 
kind of man. Frankly, Morey, I 
just don’t have any patience at 
all with the stupid, stodgy men 



who just work in their offices all 
day and eat all their dinners 
every night, and gad about and 
consume like mad and where does 
it all get them, anyhow? That’s 
right, I can see you understand. 
Just one crazy rush of consume, 
consume from the day you’re 
bom plop to the day you’re 
buried pop! And who’s to blame 
if not the robots?” 

inAINTLY, a tinge of worry 
began to appear on the sur- 
face of Howland’s relaxed calm. 
“Tan,” he chided, “Morey may 
not be very interested in poli- 
tic?.” 

Politics, Morey thought; well, 
at least that was a clue. He’d had 
the dizzying feeling, while the 
woman was talking, that he him- 
self was the ball in the games ma- 
chine he had designed for the 
shop earlier that day. Following 
the woman’s conversation might, 
at that, give his next design some 
valuable pointers in swoops, 
curves and obstacles. 

He said, with more than half 
truth, “No, please go on, Miss 
Bigelow. I’m very much inter- 
ested.” 

She smiled; then abruptly her 
face changed to a frightening 
scowl. Morey flinched, but evi- 
dently the scowl wasn’t meant 
for him. “Robots!” she hissed. 
“Supposed to work for us, aren’t 
they? Hah! We’re their slaves, 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



slaves for every moment of every 
miserable day of our lives. Slaves! 
Wouldn’t you like to join us and 
be free, Morey?” 

Morey took cover in his drink. 
He made an expressive gesture 
with his free hand — expressive 
of exactly what, he didn’t truly 
know, for he was lost. But it 
seemed to satisfy the woman. 

She said accusingly, “Did you 
know that more than three- 
quarters of the people in this 
country have ha’d a nervous 
breakdown in the past five years 
and four months? That more 
than half of them are under the 
constant care of psychiatrists for 
psychosis — not just plain ordi- 
nary neurosis like my husband’s 
got and Howland here has got 
and you’ve got, but psychosis. 
Like I’ve got. Did you know that? 
Did you know that forty per cent 
of the population are essentially 
manic depressive, thirty-one per 
cent are schizoid, thirty-eight per 
cent have an assortment of other 
unfixed psychogenic disturbances 
and twenty-four — ” 

“Hold it a minute, Tan,” How- 
land interrupted critically. 
“You’ve got too many per cents 
there. Start over again.” 

“Oh, the hell with it,” the wo- 
man said moodily. “I wish my 
husband were here. He expresses 
it so much better than I do.” She 
swallowed her drink. “Since 
you’ve wriggled off the hook," 



she said nastily to Morey, “how 
about setting up another round — 
on my ration book this time?” 
Morey did ; it was the simplest 
thing to do in his confusion. When 
that was gone, they had another 
on Howland’s book. 

A S near as he could figure out, 
the woman, her husband and 
quite possibly Howland as well 
belonged to some kind of anti- 
robot group. Morey had heard of 
such things; they had a quasi - 
legal status, neither approved 
nor prohibited, but he had never 
come into contact with them be- 
fore. Remembering the hatred he 
had so painfully relived at the 
psychodrama session, he thought 
anxiously that perhaps he be- 
longed with them. But, question 
them though he might, he couldn’t 
seem to get the principles of the 
organization firmly in mind. 

The woman finally gave up 
trying to explain it, and went off 
to find her husband while Morey 
and Howland had another drink 
and listened to two drunks squab- 
ble over who bought the next 
round. They were at the Al- 
phonse-Gaston stage of inebria- 
tion; they would regret it in the 
morning, for each was bending 
over backward to permit the 
other to pay the ration points. 
Morey wondered uneasily about 
his own points; Howland was 
certainly getting credit for a lot

of Morey’s drinking tonight. 
Served him right for forgetting 
his book, of course. 

When the woman came back, 
it was with the large man Morey 
had encountered in the company 
of Sam, the counterfeiter, steerer 
and general man about Old 
Town. 

“A remarkably small world, 
isn’t it?” boomed Walter Bige- 
low, only slightly crushing Mo- 
rey’s hand in his. “Well, sir, my 
wife has told me how interested 
you are in the basic philosophical 
drives behind our movement, and 
I should like to discuss them fur- 
ther with you. To begin with, sir, 
have you considered the principle 
of Twoness?” 

Morey said, “Why — ” 

“Very good,” said Bigelow 
courteously. He cleared his throat 
and declaimed: 

“Han-hcnded Cathay saw it first. 
Bright as brightest solar burst; 
Whipped it into boy and girl. 

The blinding spiral-sliced swirl: 
Yang 

And Yin.” 

He shrugged deprecatingly. 
“Just the first stanza,” he said. 
“I don’t know if you got much 
out of it.” 

“Well, no,” Morey admitted. 
“Second stanza,” Bigelow said 
firmly: 

“Hegel saw it, saw it clear; 

Jackal Marx drew near, drew near: 



O’er his shoulder saw it plain. 
Turned it upside down again: 

Yang 

And Yin.” 

There was an expectant pause. 
Morey said, “I — uh — ” 

“Wraps it all up, doesn’t it?” 
Bigelow’s wife demanded. “Oh, 
if only others could see it as 
clearly as you do! The robot peril 
and the robot savior. Starvation 
and surfeit. Always twoness, al- 
ways!” 

T>IGELOW patted Morey's 
shoulder. “The next stanza 
makes it even clearer,” he said. 
“It’s really very clever — I 
shouldn’t say it, of course, but 
it’s Howland's as much as it’s 
mine. He helped me with the 
verses.” Morey darted a glance at 
Howland, but Howland was care- 
fully looking away. “Third stan- 
za,” said Bigelow. “This is a 
hard one, because it’s long, so pay 
attention.” 

Justice, tip your sightless scales; 

One pan rises, one pan falls. 

Howland,” he interrupted him- 
self, “are you sure about that 
rhyme? I always trip over it. 
Well, anyway: 

Add to A and B grows less; 

A’s B’s partner, nonetheless. 

Next, the Twoness that there be

Share a reciprocity. 

Mule and female, light and^dark: 
/Voiiie the numbers of Noah's Ark! 
Yang 

And Yin!” 

“Dearest!” shrieked Bigelow’s 
wife. “You’ve never done it bet- 
ter!” There was a spatter of ap- 
plause, and Morey realized for 
the first time that half the bar 
had stopped its noisy revel to 
listen to them. Bigelow was evi- 
dently quite a well-known figure 
here. 

Morey said weakly, “I’ve never 
heard anything like it.” 

He turned hesitantly to How- 
land, who promptly said, “Drink! 
What we all need right now is a 
drink.” 

They had a drink on Bigelow’s 
book. 

Morey got Howland aside and 
asked him, “Look, level with me. 
Are these people nuts?” 

Howland showed pique. “No. 
Certainly not.” 

“Does that poem mean any- 
thing? Does this whole business 
of twoness mean anything?” 

Howland shrugged. “If it 
means something to them, it 
means something. They’re phil- 
osophers, Morey. They see deep 
into things. You don’t know what 
a privilege it is for me to be al- 
lowed to associate with them.” 

They had another drink. On 
Howland’s book, of course. 



M OREY eased Walter Bigelow 
over to a quiet spot. He 
said, “Leaving twoness out of it 
for the moment, what’s this about 
the robots?” 

Bigelow looked at him round - 
eyed. “Didn’t you understand 
the poem?” 

“Of course I did. But diagram 
it for me in simple terms so I 
can tell my wife.” 

Bigelow beamed. “It’s about 
the dichotomy of robots,” he ex- 
plained. “Like the little salt mill 
that the boy wished for: it ground 
out salt and ground out salt and 
ground out salt. He had to have 
salt, but not that much salt. 
Whitehead explains it clearly — ” 
They had another drink on 
Bigelow’s book. 

Morey wavered over Tanaquil 
Bigelow. He said fuzzily, “Listen. 
Mrs. Walter Tanquil Strongarm 
Bigelow. Listen.” 

She grinned smugly at him. 
“Brown hair,” she said dreamily. 

Morey shook his head vigor- 
ously. “Never mind hair,” he or- 
dered. “Never mind poem. Listen. 
In pre-cise and el-e-men-ta-ry 
terms, explain to me what is 
wrong with the world today.” 
“Not enough brown hair,” she 
said promptly. 

“Never mind hair!” 

“All right,” she said agreeably. 
"Too many robots. Too many 
robots make too much of every- 
thing.”

“Ha! Got it!” Morey exclaim- 
ed triumphantly. “Get rid of 
robots!” 

“Oh, no. No! No! No. We 
wouldn’t eat. Everything is mech- 
anized. Can’t get rid of them, 
can’t slow down production — 
slowing down is dying, stopping 
is quicker dying. Principle of 
twoness is the concept that clari- 
fies all these — ” 

“No!” Morey said violently. 
“What should we do?” 

“Do? I’ll tell you what we 
should do, if that’s what you 
want. I can tell you.” 

“Then tell me.” 

“What we should do is — ” 
Tanaquil hiccupped with a look 
of refined consternation — “have 
another drink.” 

They had another drink. He 
gallantly let her pay, of course. 
She ungallantly argued with the 
bartender about the ration points 
due her. 

^T'HOUGH not a two-fisted 
drinker, Morey tried. He real- 
ly worked at it. 

He paid the price, too. For 
some little time before his limbs 
stopped moving, his mind stop- 
ped functioning. Blackout. Al- 
most a blackout, at any rate, for 
all he retained of the late eve- 
ning was a kaleidoscope of peo- 
ple and places and things. 
Howland was there, drunk as a 
skunk, disgracefully drunk, Mo- 



rey remembered thinking as he 
stared up at Howland from the 
floor. The Bigelows were there. 
His wife Cherry, solicitous and 
amused, was there. And oddly 
enough, Henry was there. 

It was very, very hard to re- 
construct. Morey devoted a whole 
morning’s hangover to the effort. 
It was important to reconstruct 
it, for some reason. But Morey 
couldn’t even remember whot 
the reason was; and finally he 
dismissed it, guessing that he hud 
either solved the secret of two- 
ness or whether Tanaquil Bigr 
low’s remarkable figure wm 
natural. 

He did, however, know that 
the next morning he had waked 
in his own bed, with no recollec- 
tion of getting there. No recollec- 
tion of anything much, at least 
not of anything that fit into the 
proper chronological order or 
seemed to mesh with anything 
else, after the dozenth drink when 
he and Howland, arms around 
each other’s shoulders, composed 
a new verse on twoness and, pla- 
giarizing an old marching tune, 
howled it across the boisterous 
barroom : 

“A twoness on the scene much later 
Rests in your refrigerator. 

Heat your house and insulate it. 
Next your food: Refrigerate it. 

Frost will damp your Freon coils. 

So flux in nichrome till it boils. 

See the picture? Heat in cold 
In heat in cold, the story’s told!

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



(iiant-writ the sacred scrawl: 

Oh, the twoness of it all! 

Yang 

And Yin!” 

It had, at any rate, seemed to 
mean something at the time. 

If alcohol opened Morey’s eyes 
to the fact there was a twoness, 
perhaps alcohol was what he 
needed. For there was. 

Call it a dichotomy, if the word 
seems more couth. A kind of two- 
pronged struggle, the struggle of 
two unwearying runners in an 
immortal race. There is the re- 
frigerator inside the house. The 
cold air, the bubble of heated air 
that is the house, the bubble of 
cooled air that is the refrigerator, 
the momentary bubble of heated 
air that defrosts it. Call the heat 
Yang, if you will. Call the cold 
Yin. Yang overtakes Yin. Then 
Yin passes Yang. Then Yang 
passes Yin. Then — 

Give them other names. Call 
Yin a mouth; call Yang a hand. 

If the hand rests, the mouth 
will starve. If the mouth stops, 
the hand will die. The hand, 
Yang, moves faster. 

Yin may not lag behind. 

Then call Yang a robot. 

And remember that a pipeline 
has two ends. 

T IKE any once-in-a-lifetime 
lush, Morey braced himself 
for the consequences — and found 
startledly that there were none. 



Cherry was a surprise to him. 
“You were so funny,” she gig- 
gled. “And, honestly, so roman- 
tic." 

He shakily swallowed his 
breakfast coffee. 

The office staff roared and 
slapped him on the back. “How- 
land tells us you’re living high, 
boy!” they bellowed more or less 
in the same words. “Hey, listen 
to what Morey did — went on the 
town for the night of a lifetime 
and didn't even bring his ration 
book along to cash in!" 

They thought it was a won- 
derful joke. 

But, then, everything was go- 
ing well. Cherry, it seemed, had 
reformed out of recognition. True, 
she still hated to go out in the 
evening and Morey never saw- 
her forcing herself to gorge on 
unwanted food or play undesired 
games. But, moping into the 
pantry one afternoon, he found 
to his incredulous delight that 
they were well ahead of their ra- 
tion quotas. In some items, in 
fact, they were out — a month’s 
supply and more was gone ahead 
of schedule! 

Nor was it the counterfeit 
stamps, for he had found them 
tucked behind a bain-marie and 
quietly burned them. He cast 
about for ways of complimenting 
her, but caution prevailed. She 
was sensitive on the subject; 
leave it be.

And virtue had its reward. 
Wain wright called him in, all 
smiles. “Morey, great news! 
We’ve all appreciated your work 
here and we’ve been able to show 
it in some more tangible way 
than compliments. I didn’t want 
to say anything till it was defi- 
nite, but — your status has been 
reviewed by Classification and 
the Ration Board. You’re out of 
Class Four Minor, Morey!” 
Morey said tremulously, hard- 
ly daring to hope, “I’m a full 
Class Four?” 

“Class Five, Morey. Class Five! 
When we do something, we do it 
right. We asked for a special 
waiver and got it — you’ve skip- 
ped a whole class.” He added 
honestly, “Not that it was just 
our backing that did it, of course. 
Your own recent splendid record 
of consumption helped a lot. I 
told you you could do it!” 

Morey had to sit down. He 
missed the rest of what Wain- 
wright had to say, but it couldn’t 
have mattered. He escaped from 
the office, sidestepped the knot of 
fellow-employees waiting to con- 
gratulate him, and got to a phone. 

l^HERRY was as ecstatic and 
^ inarticulate as he. “Oh, darl- 
ing!” was all she could say. 

“And I couldn’t have done it 
without you,” he babbled. “Wain- 
wright as much as said so him- 
self. Said if it wasn’t for the way 



we — well, you have been keeping 
up with the rations, it never 
would have got by the Board. 
I’ve been meaning to say some- 
thing to you about that, dear, but 
I just haven’t known how. But I 
do appreciate it. I — Hello?” 
There was a curious silence at 
the other end of the phone. “Hel- 
lo?” he repeated worriedly. 

Cherry’s voice was intense and 
low. “Morey Fry, I think you’re 
mean. I wish you hadn’t spoiled 
the good news.” And she hung 
up. 

Morey stared slack-jawed at 
the phone. 

Howland appeared behind him, 
chuckling. “Women,” he said. 
“Never try to figure them. Any- 
way, congratulations, Morey.” 

“Thanks,” Morey mumbled. 

Howland coughed and said, 
“Uh — by the way, Morey, now 
that you’re one of the big shots, 
so to speak, you won’t — uh — feel 
obliged to — well, say anything to 
Wainwright, for instance, about 
anything I may have said while 
we — ” 

“Excuse me,” Morey said, un- 
hearing, and pushed past him. 
He thought wildly of calling 
Cherry back, of racing home to 
see just what he’d said that was 
wrong. Not that there was much 
doubt, of course. He’d touched 
her on her sore point. 

Anyway, his wristwatch was 
chiming a reminder of the fact 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that his psychiatric appointment 
for the week was coming up. 

Morey sighed. The day gives 
and the day takes away. Blessed 
is the day that gives only good 
things. 

If any. 

fTiHE session went badly. Many 
of the sessions had been going 
badly, Morey decided; there had 
been more and more whispering 
in knots of doctors from which 
he was excluded, poking and 
probing in the dark instead of the 
precise psychic surgery he was 
used to. Something was wrong, 
he thought. 

Something was. Semmel weiss 
confirmed it when he adjourned 
the group session. After the other 
doctor had left, he sat Morey 
down for a private talk. On his 
own time, too — he didn’t ask for 
his usual ration fee. That told 
Morey how important the prob- 
lem was. 

“Morey,” said Semmelweiss, 
“you’re holding back.” 

“I don’t mean to, Doctor,” 
Morey said earnestly. 

“Who knows what you ‘mean’ 
to do? Part of you ‘means’ to. 
We’ve dug pretty deep and we’ve 
found some important things. 
Now there’s something I can’t 
put my finger on. Exploring the 
mind, Morey, is like sending 
scouts through cannibal territory. 
You can’t see the cannibals — un- 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



til it’s too late. But if you send a 
scout through the jungle and he 
doesn’t show up on the other side, 
it’s a fair assumption that some- 
thing obstructed his way. In that 
case, we would label the obstruc- 
tion ‘cannibals.’ In the case of 
the human mind, we label the ob- 
struction a ‘trauma.’ What the 
trauma is, or what its effects on 
behavior will be, we have to find 
out, once we know that it’s there.” 

Morey nodded. All of this was 
familiar; he couldn’t see what 
Semmelweiss was driving at. 

Semmelweiss sighed. “The 
trouble with healing traumas and 
penetrating psychic blocks and 
releasing inhibitions — the trouble 
with everything we psychiatrists 
do, in fact, is that we can’t afford 
to do it too well. An inhibited 
man is under a strain. We try to 
relieve the strain. But if we suc- 
ceed completely, leaving him 
with no inhibitions at all, we 
have an outlaw, Morey. Inhibi- 
tions are often socially necessary. 
Suppose, for instance, that an 
average man were not inhibited 
against blatant waste. It could 
happen, you know. Suppose that 
instead of consuming his ration 
quota in an orderly and respon- 
sible way, he did such things as 
set fire to his house and every- 
thing in it or dumped his food 
allotment in the river. 

“When only a few individuals 
are doing it, we treat the indivi- 

37 



duals. But if it were done on a 
mass scale, Morey, it would be 
the end of society as we know it. 
Think of the whole collection of 
anti-social actions that you see 
in every paper. Man beats wife; 
wife turns into a harpy; junior 
smashes up windows; husband 
starts a black-market stamp 
racket. And every one of them 
traces to a basic weakness in the 
mind’s defenses against the most 
important single anti-social phe- 
nomenon — failure to consume." 

Morey flared, “That’s not fair, 
Doctor! That was weeks ago! 
We’ve certainly been on the ball 
lately. I was just commended by 
the Board, in fact — ” 

The doctor said mildly, “Why 
so violent, Morey? I only made 
a general remark." 

“It’s just natural to resent be- 
ing accused.” 

The doctor shrugged. “First, 
foremost and above all, we do 
not accuse patients of things. We 
try to help you find things out.” 
He lit his end -of -session ciga- 
rette. “Think about it, please. I’ll 
see you next week." 

C HERRY was composed and 
unapproachable. She kissed 
him remotely when he came in. 
She said, “I called Mother and 
told her the good news. She and 
Dad promised to come over here 
to celebrate.” 

“Yeah,” said Morey. “Darling, 



what did I say wrong on the 
phone?" 

“They’ll be here about six.” 

“Sure. But what did I say? 
Was it about the rations? If 
you’re sensitive, I swear I’ll never 
mention them again.” 

“I am sensitive, Morey." 

He said despairingly, “I’m 
sorry. I just — ” 

He had a better idea. He kiss- 
ed her. 

Cherry was passive at first, 
but not for long. When he had 
finished kissing her, she pushed 
him away and actually giggled. 
“Let me get dressed for dinner.” 

“Certainly. Anyway, I was 
just — ” 

She laid a finger on his lips. 

He let her escape and, feeling 
much less tense, drifted into the 
library. The afternoon papers 
were waiting for him. Virtuously, 
he sat down and began going 
through them in order. Midway 
through the World-Telegram- 
Sun-Post-and-News, he rang for 
Henry. 

Morey had read clear through 
to the drama section of the Time s- 
Her aid -Tribune -Mirror before 
the robot appeared. “Good eve- 
ning,” it said politely. 

“What took you so long?" 
Morey demanded. “Where are 
all the robots?” 

Robots do not stammer, but 
there was a distinct pause before 
Henry said, “Belowstairs, sir. 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Did you want them for some- 
thing?” 

‘‘Well, no. I just haven’t seen 
them around. Get me a drink.” 

It hesitated. “Scotch, sir?” 

“ Before dinner? Get me a Man- 
hattan.” 

“We’re all out of Vermouth, 
sir.” 

“All out? Would you mind tell- 
ing me how?” 

“It’s all used up, sir.” 

“Now that’s just ridiculous,” 
Morey snapped. “We have never 
run out of liquor in our whole 
lives and you know it. Good 
heavens, we just got our allot- 
ment in the other day and I 
certainly — ” 

He checked himself. There was 
a sudden flicker of horror in his 
eyes as he stared at Henry. 

“You certainly what, sir?” the 
robot prompted. 

Morey swallowed. “Henry, did 
I— did I do something I shouldn’t 
have?” 

“I’m sure I wouldn’t know, sir. 
It isn’t up to me to say what you 
should and shouldn’t do.” 

“Of course not,” Morey agreed 
grayly. 

He sat rigid, staring hopelessly 
into space, remembering. What 
he remembered was no pleasure 
to him at all. 

“Henry,” he said. “Come along, 
we’re going belowstairs. Right 
now!” 



IT had been Tanaquil Bigelow’s 

remark about the robots. Too 
many robots — make too much of 
everything. 

That had implanted the idea; 
it germinated in Morey’s home. 
More than a little drunk, less 
than ordinarily inhibited, he had 
found the problem clear and the 
answer obvious. 

He stared around him in dismal 
worry. His own robots, following 
his own orders, given weeks be- 
fore . 

Henry said, “It’s just what you 
told us to do, sir.” 

Morey groaned. He was watch- 
ing a scene of unparalleled activi- 
ty, and it sent shivers up and 
down his spine. 

There was the butler-robot, 
hard at work, his copper face ex- 
pressionless. Dressed in Morey’s 
own sports knickers and golflng 
shoes, the robot solemnly hit a 
ball against the wall, picked it 
up and teed it, hit it again, over 
and again, with Morey’s own 
clubs. Until the ball wore ragged 
and was replaced; and the shafts 
of the clubs leaned out of true; 
and the close-stitched seams in 
the clothing began to stretch and 
abrade. 

“My God!” said Morey hol- 
lowly. 

There were the maid-robots, 
exquisitely dressed in Cherry’s 
best, walking up and down in the 
delicate, slim shoes, sitting and 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



39 



rising and bending and turning. 
The cook-robots and the serving- 
robots were preparing dionysian 
meals. 

Morey swallowed. “You — 
you’ve been doing this right 
along.” he said to Henry. “That’s 
why the quotas have been filled.” 

"Oh, yes, sir. Just as you told 
us.” 

Morey had to sit down. One of 
the serving-robots politely scur- 
ried over with a chair, brought 
from upstairs for their new 
chores. 



Waste. 

Morey tasted the word between 
his lips. 

Waste. 

You never wasted things. You 
used them. If necessary, you 
drove yourself to the edge of 
breakdown to use them; you 
made every breath a burden and 
every hour a torment to use 
them, until through diligent con- 
suming and/or occupational mer- 
it, you were promoted to the next 
higher class, and were allowed to 
consume less frantically. But you 




40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



didn’t wantonly destroy or throw 
out. You consumed. 

Morey thought fearfully : When 
the Board finds out about this . 

Still, he reminded himself, the 
Board hadn’t found out. It might 
take some time before they did, 
for humans, after all, never en- 
tered robot quarters. There was 
no law against it, not ever a sac- 
rosanct custom. But there was 
no reason to. When breaks oc- 
curred, which was infrequently, 
maintenance robots or repair 
squads came in and put them 
back in order. Usually the hu- 
mans involved didn’t even know 
it had happened, because the 
robots used their own TBR ra- 
dio circuits and the process was 
next thing to automatic. 

Morey said reprovingly, “Hen- 
ry, you should have told — well, 
I mean reminded me about this.” 
“But, sir!” Henry protested. 
“ ‘Don’t tell a living soul,’ you 
said. You made it a direct order.” 
“Umph. Well, keep it that way. 
I — uh — I have to go back up- 
stairs. Better get the rest of the 
robots started on dinner.” 

Morey left, not comfortably. 

*T^HE dinner to celebrate Mo- 
rey’s promotion was difficult. 
Morey liked Cherry’s parents. 
Old Elon, after the pre-marriage 
inquisition that father must in- 
evitably give to daughter’s suitor, 
had buckled right down to the 



job of adjustment. The old folks 
were good about not interfering, 
good about keeping their superior 
social status to themselves, good 
about helping out on the budget 
— at least once a week, they could 
be relied on to come over for a 
hearty meal, and Mrs. Elon had 
more than once remade some of 
Cherry’s new dresses to fit her- 
self, even to the extent of wear- 
ing all the high-point ornamenta- 
tion. 

And they had been wonderful 
about the wedding gifts, when 
Morey and their daughter got 
married. The most any member 
of Morey’s family had been will- 
ing to take was a silver set or a 
few crystal table pieces. The 
Elons had come through with a 
dazzling promise to accept a car, 
a bird-bath for their garden and 
a complete set of living-room fur- 
niture! Of course, they could af- 
ford it — they had to consume so 
little that it wasn’t much strain 
for them even to take gifts of that 
magnitude. But without their 
help, Morey knew, the first few 
months of matrimony would have 
been even tougher consuming 
than they were. 

But on this particular night it 
was hard for Morey to like any- 
one. He responded with mono- 
syllables ; he barely grunted when 
Elon proposed a toast to his pro- 
motion and his brilliant future. 
He was preoccupied. 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



41 



Rightly so. Morey, in his deep- 
est, bravest searching, could find 
no clue in his memory as to just 
what the punishment might be 
for what he had done. But he had 
a sick certainty that trouble lay 
ahead. 

Morey went over his problem 
so many times that an anesthesia 
set in. By the time dinner was 
ended and he and his father-in- 
law were in the den with their 
brandy, he was more or less func- 
tioning again. 

Elon, for the first time since 
Morey had known him, offered 
Morey one of his cigars. “You’re 
Grade Five— can afford to smoke 
somebody else’s now, hey?” 

“Yeah,” Morey said glumly. 

There was a moment of silence. 
Then Elon, as punctilious as any 
companion-robot, coughed and 
tried again. “Remember being 
peaked till I hit Grade Five,” he 
reminisced meaningfully. “Con- 
suming keeps a man on the go, all 
right. Things piled up at the law 
office, couldn’t be taken care of 
while ration points piled up, too. 
And consuming comes first, of 
course — that’s a citizen’s prime 
duty. Mother and I had our share 
of grief over that, but a couple 
that wants to make a go of mar- 
riage and citizenship just pitches 
in and does the job, hey?” 

Morey repressed a shudder 
and managed to nod. 

“Best thing about upgrading,” 



Elon went on, as if he had elicited 
a satisfactory answer, “don’t have 
to spend so much time consum- 
ing, give more attention to work. 
Greatest luxury in the world, 
work. Wish I had as much stam- 
ina as you young fellows. Five 
days a week in court are about all 
I can manage. Hit six for a while, 
relaxed first time in my life, but 
my doctor made me cut down. 
Said we can’t overdo pleasures. 
You’ll be working two days a 
week now, hey?” 

Morey produced another nod. 

T?LON drew deeply on his cigar, 
his eyes bright as they watch- 
ed Morey. He was visibly puz- 
zled, and Morey, even in his half- 
daze, could recognize the exact 
moment at which Elon drew the 
wrong inference. “Ah, everything 
okay with you and Cherry?” he 
asked diplomatically. 

“Fine!” Morey exclaimed. 
“Couldn’t be better!” 

“Good. Good.” Elon changed 
the subject with almost an audi- 
ble wrench. “Speaking of court, 
had an interesting case the other 
day. Young fellow — year or two 
younger than you, I guess — came 
in with a Section Ninety-seven on 
him. Know what that is? Break- 
ing and entering!” 

“Breaking and entering,” Mo- 
rey repeated wonderingly, inter- 
ested in spite of himself. “Break- 
ing and entering what?” 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Houses. Old term; law’s full of 
them. Originally applied to steal- 
ing things. Still does, I discover- 
ed.” 

“You mean he stole some- 
thing?” Morey asked in bewild- 
erment. 

“Exactly! He stole. Strangest 
thing I ever came across. Talked 
it over with one of his bunch of 
lawyers later; new one on him, 
too. Seems this kid had a girl 
friend, nice kid but a little, you 
know, plump. She got interested 
in art.” 

“There’s nothing wrong with 
that,” Morey said. 

“Nothing wrong with her, eith- 
er. She didn’t do anything. She 
didn’t like him too much, though. 
Wouldn’t marry him. Kid got to 
thinking about how he could get 
her to change her mind and — 
well, you know that big Mondri- 
an in the Museum?” 

“I’ve never been there,” Morey 
said, somewhat embarrassed. 

“Um. Ought to try it some day, 
boy. Anyway, comes closing time 
at the Museum the other day, 
this kid sneaks in. He steals the 
painting. That’s right — steals it. 
Takes it to give to the girl.” 

Morey shook his head blankly. 
“I never heard of anything like 
that in my life.” 

“Not many have. Girl wouldn’t 
take it, by the way. Got scared 
when he brought it to her. She 
must’ve tipped off the police, I 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



guess. Somebody did. Took ’em 
three hours to find it, even when 
they knew it was hanging on a 
wall. Pretty poor kid. Forty- two 
room house.” 

“And there was a law against 
it?” Morey asked. “I mean it’s 
like making a law against breath- 
ing.” 

“Certainly was. Old law, of 
course. Kid got set back two 
grades. Would have been more 
but, my God, he was only a 
Grade Three as it was.” 

“Yeah,” said Morey, wetting 
his lips. “Say, Dad — ” 

“Um?” 

Morey cleared his throat. “Uh 
— I wonder — I mean what’s the 
penalty, for instance, for things 
like — well, misusing rations or 
anything like that?” 

Elon’s eyebrows went high. 
“Misusing rations?” 

“Say you had a liquor ration, 
It might be, and instead of drink- 
ing it, you — well, flushed it down 
the drain or something . 

His voice trailed off. Elon was 
frowning. He said, “Funny thing, 
seems I’m not as broadminded as 
I thought I was. For some reason, 
I don’t find that amusing.” 
“Sorry,” Morey croaked. 

And he certainly was. 

TT might be dishonest, but it 
was doing him a lot of good, 
for days went by and no one 
seemed to have penetrated his 

43 



secret. Cherry was happy. Wain- 
wright found occasion after oc- 
casion to pat Morey’s back. The 
wages of sin were turning out to 
be prosperity and happiness. 

There was a bad moment when 
Morey came home to find Cherry 
in the middle of supervising a 
team of packing-robots; the new 
house, suitable to his higher 
grade, was ready, and they were 
expected to move in the next day. 
But Cherry hadn’t been below- 
stairs, and Morey had his house- 
hold robots clean up the evidences 
of what they had been doing be- 
fore the packers got that far. 

The new house was, by Morey’s 
standards, pure luxury. 

It was only fifteen rooms. Mo- 
rey had shrewdly retained one 
more robot than was required for 
a Class Five, and had been al- 
lowed a compensating deduction 
in the size of his house. 

The robot quarters were less 
secluded than in the old house, 
though, and that was a disad- 
vantage. More than once Cherry 
had snuggled up to him in the 
delightful intimacy of their one 
bed in their single bedroom and 
said, with faint curiosity, “I wish 
they’d stop that noise.” And Mo- 
rey had promised to speak to 
Henry about it in the morning. 
But there was nothing he could 
say to Henry, of course, unless 
he ordered Henry to stop the 
tireless consuming through each 



of the day’s twenty-four hours 
that kept them always ahead, but 
never quite far enough ahead, of 
the inexorable weekly increment 
of ration quotas. 

But, though Cherry might 
once in a while have a moment’s 
curiosity about what the robots 
were doing, she was not likely to 
be able to guess at the facts. Her 
upbringing was, for once, on 
Morey’s side — she knew so little 
of the grind, grind, grind of con- 
suming that was the lot of the 
lower classes that she scarcely 
noticed that there was less of it. 

Morey almost, sometimes, re- 
laxed. 

He thought of many ingenious 
chores for the robots, and the ro- 
bots politely and emotionlessly 
obeyed. 

Morey was a success. 

It wasn’t all gravy. There was 
a nervous moment for Morey 
when the quarterly survey report 
came in the mail. As the day for 
the Ration Board to check over 
the degree of wear on the turned- 
in discards came due, Morey be- 
gan to sweat. The clothing and 
furniture and household goods 
the robots had consumed for him 
were very nearly in shreds. It had 
to look plausible, that was the 
big thing — no normal person 
would wear a hole completely 
through the knee of a pair of 
pants, as Henry had done with 
his dress suit before Morey stop- 



44

ped him. Would the Board ques- 
tion it? 

Worse, was there something 
about the way the robots con- 
sumed the stuff that would give 
the whole show away? Some 
special wear point in the robot 
anatomy, for instance, that would 
rub a hole where no human’s 
body could, or stretch a seam 
that should normally be under 
no strain at all? 

It was worrisome. But the wor- 
ry was needless. When the report 
of survey came, Morey let out a 
long-held breath. Not a single 
item disallowed! 

Morey was a success — and so 
was his scheme! 

HPO the successful man come 
the rewards of success. Morey 
arrived home one evening after a 
hard day’s work at the office and 
was alarmed to find another car 
parked in his drive. It was a tiny 
two-seater, the sort affected by 
top officials and the very well- 
to-do. 

Right then and there Morey 
learned the first half of the em- 
bezzlers’ lesson: Anything dif- 
ferent is dangerous. He came un- 
easily into his own home, fearful 
that some high officer of the Ra- 
tion Board had come to ask ques- 
tions. 

But Cherry was glowing. “Mr. 
Porfirio is a newspaper feature 
writer and he wants to write you 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



up for their ‘Consumers of Dis- 
tinction’ page! Morey, I couldn't 
be more proud!” 

“Thanks,” said Morey glumly. 
“Hello.” 

Mr. Porfirio shook Morey’s 
hand warmly. “I’m not exactly 
from a newspaper,” he corrected. 
“Trans-video Press is what it is, 
actually. We’re a news wire ser- 
vice; we supply forty-seven hun- 
dred papers with news and feature 
material. Every one of them,” he 
added complacently, “on the re- 
quired consumption list of Grades 
One through Six inclusive. We 
have a Sunday supplement self- 
help feature on consuming prob- 
lems and we like to— well, give 
credit where credit is due. You've 
established an enviable record, 
Mr. Fry. We’d like to tell our 
readers about it.” 

“Um,” said Morey. “Let’s go 
in the drawing room.” 

“Oh, no!” Cherry said firmly. 
“I want to hear this. He’s so 
modest, Mr. Porfirio, you’d real- 
ly never know what kind of a 
man he is just to listen to him 
talk. Why, my goodness, I’m his 
wife and I swear I don’t know 
how he does all the consuming he 
does. He simply — ” 

“Have a drink, Mr. Porfirio,” 
Morey said, against all etiquette. 
“Rye? Scotch? Bourbon? Gin- 
and-tonic? Brandy Alexander? 
Dry Manha — I mean what would 
you like?” He became conscious 

45 



that he was babbling like a fool. 

“Anything,” said the newsman. 
“Rye is fine. Now, Mr. Fry, I 
notice you’ve fixed up your place 
very attractively here and your 
wife says that your country home 
is just as nice. As soon as I came 
in, I said to myself, ‘Beautiful 
home. Hardly a stick of furni- 
ture that isn’t absolutely neces- 
sary. Might be a Grade Six or 
Seven.’ And Mrs. Fry says the 
other place is even barer.” 

“She does, does she?” Morey 
challenged sharply. “Well, let me 
tell you, Mr. Porfirio, that every 
last scrap of my furniture allow- 
ance is accounted for! I don’t 
know what you’re getting at, 
but — ” 

“Oh, I certainly didn’t mean 
to imply anything like that! I 
just want to get some information 
from you that I can pass on to 
our readers. You know, to sort 
of help them do as well as your- 
self. How do you do it?” 

Tl/|OREY swallowed. “We — uh 
— well, we just keep after it. 
Hard work, that’s all.” 

Porfirio nodded admiringly. 
“Hard work,” he repeated, and 
fished a triple-folded sheet of 
paper out of his pocket to make 
notes on. “Would you say,” he 
went on, “that anyone could do 
as well as you simply by devot- 
ing himself to it — setting a regu- 
lar schedule, for example, and 



keeping to it very strictly?” 

“Oh, yes,” said Morey. 

“In other words, it’s only a 
matter of doing what you have 
to do every day?” 

“That’s it exactly. I handle the 
budget in my house — more ex- 
perience than my wife, you see — 
but no reason a woman can’t do 
it.” 

“Budgeting,” Porfirio recorded 
approvingly. “That’s our policy, 
too.” 

The interview was not the ter- 
ror it had seemed, not even when 
Porfirio tactfully called attention 
to Cherry’s slim waistline (“So 
many housewives, Mrs. Fry, find 
it difficult to keep from being — 
well, a little plump”) and Morey 
had to invent endless hours on 
the exercise machines, while 
Cherry looked faintly perplexed, 
but did not interrupt. 

From the interview, however, 
Morey learned the second half of 
the embezzler’s lesson. After Por- 
firio had gone, he leaped in and 
spoke more than a little firmly to 
Cherry. “That business of exer- 
cise, dear. We really have to start 
doing it. I don’t know if you’ve 
noticed it, but you are beginning 
to get just a trifle heavier and we 
don’t want that to happen, do 
we?” 

In the following grim and un- 
necessary sessions on the mechan- 
ical horses, Morey had plenty of 
time to reflect on the lesson. 



46

Stolen treasures are less sweet 
than one would like, when one 
dare not enjoy them in the open. 

But some of Morey’s treasures 
were fairly earned. 

The new Bradmoor K-50 Spin- 
a-Game, for instance, was his 
very own. His job was design 
and creation, and he was a for- 
tunate man in that his efforts 
were permitted to be expended 
along the line of greatest social 
utility — namely, to increase con- 
sumption. 

The Spin-a-Game was a well- 
nigh perfect machine for the pur- 
pose. “Brilliant,” said Wain- 
wright, beaming, when the pilot 
machine had been put through 
its first tests. “Guess they don’t 
call me the Talent-picker for 
nothing. I knew you could do it, 
boy !” 

Even Howland was lavish in 
his praise. He sat munching on a 
plate of petits- fours (he was still 
only a Grade Three) while the 
tests were going on, and when 
they were over, he said enthusias- 
tically, “It’s a beauty, Morey. 
That series-corrupter — sensation- 
al! Never saw a prettier piece of 
machinery.” 

Morey flushed gratefully. 

W 7 -AINWRIGHT left, exuding 
** praise, and Morey patted 
his pilot model affectionately and 
admired its polychrome gleam. 
The looks of the machine, as 



Wainwright had lectured many 
a time, were as important as its 
function: “You have to make 
them want to play it, boy! They 
won’t play it if they don't see it!” 
And consequently the whole K 
series was distinguished by flash- 
ing rainbows of light, provocative 
strains of music, haunting scents 
that drifted into the nostrils of 
the passerby with compelling 
effect. 

Morey had drawn heavily on 
all the old masterpieces of de- 
sign — the one-arm bandit, the 
pinball machine, the juke box. 
You put your ration book in the 
hopper. You spun the wheels un- 
til you selected the game you 
wanted to play against the ma- 
chine. You punched buttons or 
spun dials or, in any of 325 
different ways, you pitted your 
human skill against the magnetic- 
taped skills of the machine. 

And you lost. You had a chance 
to win, but the inexorable statis- 
tics of the machine’s setting made 
sure that if you played long 
enough, you had to lose. 

That is to say, if you risked a 
ten-point ration stamp— showing, 
perhaps, that you had consumed 
three six-course meals — your sta- 
tistic return was eight points. 
You might hit the jackpot and 
get a thousand points back, and 
thus be exempt from a whole 
freezer-full of steaks and joints 
and prepared vegetables; but it 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



47 



seldom happened. Most likely 
you lost and got nothing. 

Got nothing, that is, in the 
way of your hazarded ration 
stamps. But the beauty of the 
machine, which was Morey’s 
main contribution, was that, win 
or lose, you always found a pellet 
of vitamin-drenched, sugar-coat- 
ed antibiotic hormone gum in the 
hopper. You played your game, 
won or lost your stake, popped 
your hormone gum into your 
mouth and played another. By 
the time that game was ended, 
the gum was used up, the coating 
dissolved; you discarded it and 
started another. 

“That’s what the man from the 
NRB liked,” Howland told 
Morey confidentially. “He took a 
set of schematics back with him; 
they might install it on all new 
machines. Oh, you’re the fair- 
haired boy, all right!” 

It was the first Morey had 
heard about a man from the Na- 
tional Ration Board. It was good 
news. He excused himself and 
hurried to phone Cherry the story 
of his latest successes. He reached 
her at her mother’s, where she 
was spending the evening, and 
she was properly impressed and 
affectionate. He came back to 
Howland in a glowing humor. 

“Drink?” said Howland diffi- 
dently. 

“Sure,” said Morey. He could 
afford, he thought, to drink as 



much of Howland’s liquor as he 
liked; poor guy, sunk in the con- 
suming quicksands of Class 
Three. Only fair for somebody a 
little more successful to give him 
a hand once in a while. 

And when Howland, learning 
that Cherry had left Morey a 
bachelor for the evening, pro- 
posed Uncle Piggotty’s again, 
Morey hardly hesitated at all. 

npHE Bigelows were delighted 
to see him. Morey wondered 
briefly if they had a home; cer- 
tainly they didn’t seem to spend 
much time in it. 

It turned out they did, be- 
cause when Morey indicated vir- 
tuously that he’d only stopped in 
at Piggotty’s for a single drink 
before dinner, and Howland re- 
vealed that he was free for the 
evening, they captured Morey 
and bore him off to their house. 

Tanaquil Bigelow was haught- 
ily apologetic. “I don’t suppose 
this is the kind of place Mr. Fry 
is used to,” she observed to her 
husband, right across Morey, 
who was standing between them. 
“Still, we call it home.” 

Morey made an appropriately 
polite remark. Actually, the place 
nearly turned his stomach. It was 
an enormous glaringly new man- 
sion, bigger even than Morey’s 
former house, stuffed to bursting 
with bulging sofas and pianos 
and massive mahogany chairs 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and tri-D sets and bedrooms and 
drawing rooms and breakfast 
rooms and nurseries. 

The nurseries were a shock to 
Morey; it had never occurred to 
him that the Bigelows had chil- 
dren. But they did and, though 
the children were only five and 
eight, they were still up, under 
the care of a brace of robot nurse- 
maids, doggedly playing with 
their overstuffed animals and 
miniature trains. 

“You don’t know what a com- 
fort Tony and Dick are,” Tana- 
quil Bigelow told Morey. “They 
consume so much more than their 
rations. Walter says that every 
family ought to have at least two 
or three children to, you know, 
help out. Walter’s so intelligent 
about these things, it’s a pleasure 
to hear him talk. Have you heard 
his poem, Morey? The one he 
calls The Twoness of — ” 

Morey hastily admitted that he 
had. He reconciled himself to a 
glum evening. The Bigelows had 
been eccentric but fun back at 
Uncle Piggotty’s. On their own 
ground, they seemed just as ec- 
centric, but painfully dull. 

They had a round of cocktails, 
and another, and then the Bige- 
lows no longer seemed so dull. 
Dinner was ghastly, of course; 
Morey was nouveau-riche enough 
to be a snob about his relatively 
Spartan table. But he minded his 
manners and sampled, with grim 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



concentration, each successive 
course of chunky protein and rich 
marinades. With the help of the 
endless succession of table wines 
and liqueurs, dinner ended with- 
out destroying his evening or his 
strained digestive system. 

And afterward, they were a 
pleasant company in the Bige- 
lows’ ornate drawing room. Tana- 
quil Bigelow, in consultation with 
the children, checked over their 
ration books and came up with 
the announcement that they 
would have a brief recital by a 
pair of robot dancers, followed 
by string music by a robot quar- 
tet. Morey prepared himself for 
the worst, but found before the 
dancers were through that he was 
enjoying himself. Strange lesson 
for Morey : When you didn’t have 
to watch them, the robot enter- 
tainers were fun! 

“Good night, dears,” Tanaquil 
Bigelow said firmly to the chil- 
dren when the dancers were done. 
The boys rebelled, naturally, but 
they went. It was only a matter 
of minutes, though, before one of 
them was back, clutching at 
Morey’s sleeve with a pudgy 
hand. 

11/f OREY looked at the boy un- 
easily, having little experi- 
ence with children. He said, “Uh 
— what is it, Tony?” 

“Dick, you mean,” the boy said. 
“Gimme your autograph.” He 

49 



poked an engraved pad and a 
vulgarly jeweled pencil at Morey. 

Morey dazedly signed and the 
child ran off, Morey staring after 
him. Tanaquil Bigelow laughed 
and explained, “He saw your 
name in Porfirio’s column. Dick 
loves Porfirio, reads him every 
day. He’s such an intellectual 
kid, really. He’d always have his 
nose in a book if I didn’t keep 
after him to play with his trains 
and watch tri-D.” 

“That was quite a nice write- 
up,” Walter Bigelow commented 
— a little enviously, Morey 
thought. “Bet you make Con- 
sumer of the Year. I wish,” he 
sighed, “that we could get a little 
ahead on the quotas the way you 
did. But it just never seems to 
work out. We eat and play and 
consume like crazy, and somehow 
at the end of the month we’re al- 
ways a little behind in some- 
thing — everything keeps piling 
up — and then the Board sends us 
a warning, and they call me down 
and, first thing you know, I’ve 
got a couple of hundred added 
penalty points and we’re worse 
off than before.” 

“Never you mind,” Tanaquil 
replied staunchly. “Consuming 
isn’t everything in life. You have 
your work.” 

Bigelow nodded judiciously 
and offered Morey another drink. 
Another drink, however, was not 
what Morey needed. He was sit- 



ting in a rosy glow, less of alcohol 
than of sheer contentment with 
the world. 

He said suddenly, “Listen.” 
Bigelow looked up from his 
own drink. “Eh?” 

“If I tell you something that’s 
a secret, will you keep it that 
way?” 

Bigelow rumbled, “Why, I 
guess so, Morey.” 

But his wife cut in sharply, 
“Certainly we will, Morey. Of 
course! What is it?” There was 
a gleam in her eye, Morey no- 
ticed. It puzzled him, but he 
decided to ignore it. 

He said, “About that writeup. 
I — I’m not such a hot-shot con- 
sumer, really, you know. In 
fact — ” All of a sudden, every- 
one’s eyes seemed to be on him. 
For a tortured moment, Morey 
wondered if he was doing the 
right thing. A secret that two 
people know is compromised, and 
a secret known to three people is 
no secret. Still — 

“It’s like this,” he said firmly. 
“You remember what we were 
talking about at Uncle Piggotty’s 
that night? Well, when I went 
home I went down to the robot 
quarters, and I — ” 

He went on from there. 

fT^ANAQUIL Bigelow said tri- 
umphantly, “I knew it!” 
Walter Bigelow gave his wife 
a mild, reproving look. He de- 



50

dared soberly. "You’ve done a 
big thing, Morey. A mighty big 
thing. God willing, you’ve pro- 
nounced the death sentence on 
our society as we know it. Future 
generations will revere the name 
of Morey Fry.*’ He solemnly 
shook Morey’s hand. 

Morey said dazedly, “I what?" 

Walter nodded. It was a vale- 
dictory. He turned to his wife. 
“Tanaquil, we’ll have to call an 
emergency meeting.” 

“Of course, Walter,” she said 
devotedly. 

“And Morey will have to be 
there. Yes, you’ll have to, Morey; 
no excuses. We want the Brother- 
hood to meet you. Right, How- 
land?” 

Howland coughed uneasily. He 
nodded noncommittally and took 
another drink. 

Morey demanded desperately, 
“What are you talking about? 
Howland, you tell me!” 

Howland fiddled with his drink. 
“Well,” he said, “it’s like Tan 
was telling you that night. A few 
of us, well, politically mature 
persons have formed a little 
group. We — ” 

“ Little group!” Tanaquil Bige- 
low said scornfully. “Howland, 
sometimes I wonder if you really 
catch the spirit of the thing at 
all! It’s everybody. Morey, every- 
body in the world. Why, there 
are eighteen of us right here in 
Old Town! There are scores more 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



all over the world! I knew you 
were up to something like this, 
Morey. I told Walter so the 
morning after we met you. I said, 
‘Walter, mark my words, that 
man Morey is up to something.’ 
But I must say,” she admitted 
worshipfully, “I didn’t know it 
would have the scope of what 
you’re proposing now! Imagine — 
a whole world of consumers, ris- 
ing as one man, shouting the 
name of Morey Fry, fighting the 
Ration Board with the Board’s 
own weapon — the robots. What 
poetic justice!” 

B IGELOW nodded enthusias- 
tically. “Call Uncle Piggot- 
ty’s. dear,” he ordered. “See if 
you can round up a quorum right 
now! Meanwhile, Morey and I 
are going belowstairs. Let’s go, 
Morey — let’s get the new world 
started!” 

Morey sat there open-mouthed. 
He closed it with a snap. “Bige- 
low,” he whispered, “do you 
mean to say that you’re going to 
spread this idea around through 
some kind of subversive organiza- 
tion?” 

“Subversive?” Bigelow repeat- 
ed stiffly. “My dear man, all 
creative minds are subversive, 
whether they operate singly or 
in such a group as the Brother- 
hood of Freemen. I scarcely 
like—” 

“Never mind what you like,” 

51 



Morey insisted. “You’re going to 
call a meeting of this Brotherhood 
and you want me to tell them 
what I just told you. Is that 
right?” 

“Well — yes.” 

Morey got up. “I wish I could 
say it’s been nice, but it hasn’t. 
Good night!” 

And he stormed out before they 
could stop him. 

Out on the street, though, his 
resolution deserted him. He hail- 
ed a robot cab and ordered the 
driver to take him on the tradi- 
tional time-killing ride through 
the park while he made up his 
mind. 

The fact that he had left, of 
course, was not going to keep 
Bigelow from going through with 
his announced intention. Morey 
remembered, now, fragments of 
conversation from Bigelow and 
his wife at Uncle Piggotty’s, and 
cursed himself. They had, it was 
perfectly true, said and hinted 
enough about politics and pur- 
poses to put him on his guard. 
All that nonsense about twoness 
had diverted him from what 
should have been perfectly clear: 
They were subversives indeed. 

He glanced at his watch. Late, 
but not too late; Cherry would 
still be at her parents’ home. 

He leaned forward and gave 
the driver their address. It was 
like beginning the first of a hun- 
dred-shot series of injections: 



you know it’s going to cure you, 
but it hurts just tne same. 

Tl/IDREY said manfully: “And 
that’s it, sir. I know I’ve 
been a fool. I’m willing to take 
the consequences.” 

Old Elon rubbed his jaw 
thoughtfully. “Um,” he said. 

Cherry and her mother had 
long passed the point where they 
could say anything at all; they 
were seated side by side on a 
couch across the room, listening 
with expressions of strain and in- 
credulity. 

Elon said abruptly, “Excuse 
me. Phone call to make.” He 
left the room to make a brief 
call and returned. He said over 
his shoulder to his wife, “Coffee. 
We’ll need it. Got a problem 
here.” 

Morey said, “Do you think — I 
mean what should I do?” 

Elon shrugged, then, surpris- 
ingly, grinned. “What can you 
do?” he demanded cheerfully. 
“Done plenty already, I’d say. 
Drink some coffee. Call I made,” 
he explained, “was to Jim, my 
law clerk. He’ll be here in a 
minute. Get some dope from Jim, 
then we’ll know better.” 

Cherry came over to Morey 
and sat beside him. All she said 
was, “Don’t worry,” but to Morey 
it conveyed all the meaning in 
the world. He returned the pres- 
sure of her hand with a feeling of 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



deepest relief. Hell, he said to 
himself, why should I worry? 
Worst they can do to me is drop 
me a couple of grades and what’s 
so bad about that? 

He grimaced involuntarily. He 
had remembered his own early 
struggles as a Class One and what 
was so bad about that. 

The law clerk arrived, a small- 
ish robot with a battered stain- 
less-steel hide and dull coppery 
features. Elon took the robot 
aside for a terse conversation 
before he came back to Morey. 

“As I thought,” he said in sat- 
isfaction. “No precedent. No laws 
prohibiting. Therefore no crime.” 

“Thank heaven!” Morey said 
in ecstatic relief. 

Elon shook his head. “They’ll 
probably give you a recondition- 
ing and you can’t expect to keep 
your Grade Five. Probably call 
it anti -social behavior. Is, isn’t 
it?” 

Dashed, Morey said, “Oh.” He 
frowned briefly, then looked up. 
“All right, Dad, if I’ve got it 
coming to me, I’ll take my 
medicine.” 

“Way to talk,” Elon said ap- 
provingly. “Now go home. Get a 
good night’s sleep. First thing in 
the morning, go to the Ration 
Board. Tell ’em the whole story, 
beginning to end. They’ll be easy 
on you.” Elon hesitated. “Well, 
fairly easy,” he amended. “I 
hope.” 



T HE condemned man ate a 
hearty breakfast. 

He had to. That morning, as 
Morey awoke, he had the sick 
certainty that he was going to be 
consuming triple rations for a 
long, long time to come. 

He kissed Cherry good-by and 
took the long ride to the Ration 
Board in silence. He even left 
Henry behind. 

At the Board, he stammered at 
a series of receptionist robots and 
was finally brought into the pres- 
ence of a mildly supercilious 
young man named Hachette. 

“My name,” he started, “is 
Morey Fry. I — I’ve come to— 
talk over something I've been 
doing with — ” 

“Certainly, Mr. Fry,” said 
Hachette. “I’ll take you in to Mr. 
Newman right away.” 

“Don’t you want to know what 
I did?” demanded Morey. 

Hachette smiled. “What makes 
you think we don’t know?” he 
said, and left. 

That was Surprise Number 
One. 

Newman explained it. He grin- 
ned at Morey and ruefully shook 
his head. “All the time we get 
this,” he complained. “People just 
don’t take the trouble to learn 
anything about the world around 
them. Son,” he demanded, “what 
do you think a robot is?” 

Morey said, “Huh?” 

“I mean how do you think it 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



53 



operates? Do you think it’s just 
a kind of a man with a tin skin 
and wire nerves?” 

“Why, no. It’s a machine, of 
course. It isn’t human.*' 

Newman beamed. “Fine!” he 
said. “It’s a machine. It hasn’t 
got flesh or blood or intestines — 
or a brain. Oh — ” he held up a 
hand — “robots are smart enough. 
I don’t mean that. But an elec- 
tronic thinking machine, Mr. Fry, 
takes about as much space as the 
house you’re living in. It has to. 
Robots don’t carry brains around 
with them; brains are too heavy 
and much too bulky.” 

“Then how do they think?” 
“With their brains, of course.” 
“But you just said — ” 

“I said they didn’t carry them. 
Each robot is in constant radio 
communication with the Master 
Control on its TBR circuit — the 
‘Talk Between Robots’ radio. 
Master Control gives the answer, 
the robot acts.” 

“I see,” said Morey. “Well, 
that’s very interesting, but — ” 
“But you still don’t see,” said 
Newman. “Figure it out. If the 
robot gets information from Mas- 
ter Control, do you see that 
Master Control in return neces- 
sarily gets information from the 
robot?” 

“Oh,” said Morey. Then, loud- 
er, “Oh! You mean that all my 
robots have been — ” The words 
wouldn’t come. 



jVTEWMAN nodded in satisfac- 
* tion. “Every bit of informa- 
tion of that sort comes to us as a 
matter of course. Why, Mr. Fry, 
if you hadn’t come in today, we 
would have been sending for you 
within a very short time!” 

That was the second surprise. 
Morey bore up under it bravely. 
After all, it changed nothing, he 
reminded himself. 

He said, “Well, be that as it 
may, sir, here I am. I came in 
of my own free will. I’ve been 
using my robots to consume my 
ration quotas — ” 

“Indeed you have,” said New- 
man. 

“ — and I’m willing to sign a 
statement to that effect any time 
you like. I don’t know what the 
penalty is, but I’ll take it. I’m 
guilty; I admit my guilt.” 

Newman’s eyes were wide. 
"Guilty?” he repeated. “Penal- 
ty?” 

Morey was startled. “Why, 
yes,” he said. “I’m not denying 
anything.” 

“Penalties,” repeated Newman 
musingly. Then he began to 
laugh. He laughed, Morey 
thought, to considerable excess; 
Morey saw nothing he could 
laugh at, himself, in the situa- 
tion. But the situation, Morey 
was forced to admit, was rapidly 
getting completely incomprehen- 
sible. 

“Sorry,” said Newman at last, 



54

wiping his eyes, "but I couldn’t 
help it. Penalties! Well, Mr. Fry, 
let me set your mind at rest. I 
wouldn’t worry about the penal- 
ties if I were you. As soon as 
the reports began coming through 
on what you had done with your 
robots, we naturally assigned a 
special team to keep observing 
you, and we forwarded a report 
to the national headquarters. We 
made certain — ah — recommenda- 
tions in it and — well, to make a 
long story short, the answers 
came back yesterday. 

“Mr. Fry, the National Ration 
Board is delighted to know of 
your contribution toward im- 
proving our distribution problem. 
Pending a further study, a tenta- 
tive program has been adopted 
for setting up consuming-robot 
units all over the country based 
on your scheme. Penalties? Mr. 
Fry, you’re a hero!” 

A HERO has responsibilities. 
*"*■ Morey’s were quickly made 
clear to him. He was allowed 
time for a brief reassuring visit 
to Cherry, a triumphal tour of 
his old office, and then he was 
rushed off to Washington to be 
quizzed. He found the National 
Ration Board in a frenzy of work. 

“The most important job we’ve 
ever done,” one of the high offi- 
cers told him. “I wouldn’t be 
surprised if it’s the last one we 
ever have! Yes, sir, we’re trying 

THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



to put ourselves out of business 
for good and we don’t want a 
single thing to go wrong.” 

"Anything I can do to help — ” 
Morey began diffidently. 

"You’ve done fine, Mr. Fry. 
Gave us just the push we’ve been 
needing. It was there all the 
time for us to see, but we were 
too close to the forest to see the 
trees, if you get what I mean. 
Look, I’m not much on rhetoric 
and this is the biggest step man- 
kind has taken in centuries and I 
can’t put it into words. Let me 
show you what we’ve been do- 
ing.” 

He and a delegation of other 
officials of the Ration Board and 
men whose names Morey had re- 
peatedly seen in the newspapers 
took Morey on an inspection tour 
of the entire plant. 

"It’s a closed cycle, you see,” 
he was told, as they looked over 
a chamber of industriously plod- 
ding consumer-robots working 
off a shipment of shoes. "Nothing 
is permanently lost. If you want 
a car, you get one of the newest 
and best. If not, your car gets 
driven by a robot until it’s ready 
to be turned in and a new one 
gets built for next year. We don’t 
lose the metals — they can be sal- 
vaged. All we lose is a little 
power and labor. And the Sun 
and the atom give us all the 
power we need, and the robots 
give us more labor than we can 

55 



use. Same thing applies, of course, 
to all products.” 

“But what’s in it for the ro- 
bots?” Morey asked. 

“I beg your pardon?” one of 
the biggest men in the country 
said uncomprehendingly. 

Morey had a difficult moment. 
His analysis had conditioned him 
against waste and this decidedly 
was sheer destruction of goods, 
no matter how scientific the jar- 
gon might be. 

"If the consumer is just using 
up things for the sake of using 
them up,” he said doggedly, rea- 
lizing the danger he was inviting, 
“we could use wear-and-tear ma- 
chines instead of robots. After all 
why waste them?” 

They looked at each other wor- 
riedly. 

“But that’s what you were do- 
ing,” one pointed out with a 
faint note of threat. 

“Oh, no!” Morey quickly ob- 
jected. “I built in satisfaction 
circuits — my training in design, 
you know. Adjustable circuits, of 
course.” 

“Satisfaction circuits?” he was 
asked. “Adjustable?” 

“Well, sure. If the robot gets 
no satisfaction out of using up 
things — ” 

“Don’t talk nonsense,” growled 
the Ration Board official. “Ro- 
bots aren’t human. How do you 
make them feel satisfaction? And 
adjustable satisfaction at that!” 



M OREY explained. It was a 
highly technical explanation, 
involving the use of great sheets 
of paper and elaborate diagrams. 
But there were trained men in 
the group and they became even 
more excited than before. 

“Beautiful!” one cried in sci- 
entific rapture. “Why, it takes 
care of every possible moral, 
legal and psychological argu- 
ment!” 

“What does?” the Ration 
Board official demanded. “How?”. 
“You tell him, Mr. Fry.” 
Morey tried and couldn’t. But 
he ceuld show how his principle 
operated. The Ration Board lab 
was turned over to him, complete 
with more assistants than he 
knew how to give orders to, and 
they built satisfaction circuits for 
a squad of robots working in a 
hat factory. 

Then Morey gave his demon- 
stration. The robots manufac- 
tured hats of all sorts. He adjusted 
the circuits at the end of the day 
and the robots began trying on 
the hats, squabbling over them, 
each coming away triumphantly 
with a huge and diverse selection. 
Their metallic features were in- 
capable of showing pride or 
pleasure, but both were evident 
in the way they wore their hats, 
their fierce possessiveness . 
and their faster, neater, more in- 
tensive, more dedicated work to 
produce a still greater quantity 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of hats . which they also were 
allowed to own. 

‘‘You see?” an engineer ex- 
claimed delightedly. “They can 
be adjusted to want hats, to wear 
them lovingly, to wear the hats 
to pieces. And not just for the 
sake of wearing them out — the 
hats are an incentive for them!” 

“But how can we go on pro- 
ducing just hats and more hats?” 
the Ration Board man asked puz- 
zledly. “Civilization does not live 
by hats alone.” 

“That,” said Morey modestly, 
“is the beauty of it. Look." 

He set the adjustment of the 
satisfaction circuit as porter- 
robots brought in skids of gloves. 
The hat-manufacturing robots 
fought over the gloves with the 
same mechanical passion as they 
had for hats. 

“And that can apply to any- 
thing we — or the robots — pro- 
duce,” Morey added. “Every- 
thing from pins to yachts. But 
the point is that they get satis- 
faction from possession, and the 
craving can be regulated accord- 
ing to the glut in various indus- 
tries, and the robots show their 
appreciation by working harder.” 
He hesitated. “That’s what I did 
for my servant-robots. It’s a 
feedback, you see. Satisfaction 
leads to more work — and better 
work — and that means more 
goods, which they can be made 
to want, which means incentive 



to work, and so on, all around.” 

“Closed cycle,” whispered the 
Ration Board man in awe. “A 
real closed cycle this time!” 

And so the inexorable laws of 
supply and demand were irrevo- 
cably repealed. No longer was 
mankind hampered by inade- 
quate supply or drowned by 
overproduction. What mankind 
needed was there. What the race 
did not require passed into the 
insatiable — and adjustable — ro- 
bot maw. Nothing was wasted. 

For a pipeline has two ends. 

Morey was thanked, compli- 
mented, rewarded, given a ticker- 
tape parade through the city, and 
put on a plane back home. By 
that time, the Ration Board had 
liquidated itself. 

/“^HERRY met him at the air- 
^ port. They jabbered excited- 
ly at each other all the way to 
the house. 

In their own living room, they 
finished the kiss they had greeted 
each other with. At last Cherry 
broke away, laughing. 

Morey said, “Did I tell you 
I’m through with Bradmoor? 
From now on I work for the 
Board as civilian consultant. 
And," he added impressively, 
“starting right away, I’m a Class 
Eight!” 

“My!” gasped Cherry, so wor- 
shipfully that Morey felt a twinge 
of conscience. 



THE MIDAS PLAGUE 



57 



He said honestly, “Of course, 
if what they were saying in 
Washington is so, the classes 
aren’t going to mean much pretty 
soon. Still, it’s quite an honor.” 
“It certainly is,” Cherry said 
staunchly. “Why, Dad’s only a 
Class Eight himself and he’s been 
a judge for I don’t know how 
many years.” 

Morey pursed his lips. “We 
can’t all be fortunate,” he said 
generously. “Of course, the classes 
still will count for something — 
that is, a Class One will have so 
much to consume in a year, a 
Class Two will have a little less, 
and so on. But each person in 
each class will have robot help, 
you see, to do the actual con- 
suming. The way it’s going to be, 
special facsimile robots will — ” 
Cherry flagged him down. “I 
know, dear. Each family gets a 
robot duplicate of every person 
in the family.” 

“Oh,” said Morey, slightly an- 
noyed. “How did you know?” 
“Ours came yesterday,” she ex- 
plained. “The man from the 
Board said we were the first in 
the area — because it was your 
idea, of course. They haven't 
even been activated yet. I’ve still 
got them in the Green Room. 
Want to see them?” 

“Sure,” said Morey buoyantly. 



He dashed ahead of Cherry to 
inspect the results of his own 
brainstorm. There they were, 
standing statue-still against the 
wall, waiting to be energized to 
begin their endless tasks. 

“Yours is real pretty,” Morey 
said gallantly. “But — say, is that 
thing supposed to look like me?” 
He inspected the chromium face 
of the man-robot disapprovingly. 

“Only roughly, the man said.” 
Cherry was right behind him. 
“Notice anything else?” 

Morey leaned closer, inspect- 
ing the features of the facsimile 
robot at a close range. “Well, no," 
he said. “It’s got a kind of a 
squint that I don’t like, but — 
Oh, you mean that!" He bent 
over to examine a smaller robot, 
half hidden between the other 
pair. It was less than two feet 
high, big-headed, pudgy-limbed, 
thick-bellied. In fact, Morey 
thought wonderingly, it looked 
almost like — 

“My God!” Morey spun 
around, staring wide-eyed at his 
wife. “You mean — ” 

“I mean,” said Cherry, blush- 
ing slightly. 

Morey reached out to grab her 
in his arms. 

“Darling!” he cried. “Why 
didn’t you tell me?”

T HE beautiful girl slammed 
the door shut behind her 
and for a moment there 
was silence in the apartment. The 
blond young man in baggy 
tweeds looked at the closed door 
uncertainly, made a motion as if 
to follow her, and then stopped 
himself. 

“Good boy,” said a voice from 
the open window. 

“Who’s there?” The young 
man turned and squinted out 
into the darkness. 



“It’s me. Ferdie.” 

“You didn’t have to spy on 
me. I told Karl I’d break off.” 
“I wasn’t spying, Jan. Karl 
sent me over. Mind if I come in?” 
Jan grunted indifferently and a 
short stocky man drifted in 
through the window. As his feet 
touched the floor, he gave a little 
sigh of relief. He went back to 
the window, leaned out, and 
looked down the full eighty 
stories to the street below. 

“It’s a long way down there,”

he said. “Levitation’s fine, but 
I don’t think it will ever take the 
place of the old-fashioned eleva- 
tor. The way I look at it is that 
if Man was intended to fly, he’d 
have been born with wings.” 

“Man, maybe,” said Jan, “but 
not superman. Want a drink? I 
do.” 

Ferdie nodded. “Maybe our 
kids will take it as a matter of 
course, but I just can’t relax 
when I’m floating. I’m always 
afraid I’ll blow a neuron or 
something and go spinning 
down.” He gave a shudder and 
swallowed the drink in one gulp. 
“How did it go? Did she take it 
pretty hard?” 

“Tomorrow will be worse. 
She’s angry now and that acts 
as a sort of emotional anesthetic. 
When that wears off, it’s really 
going to hurt. I don’t feel so good 
myself. We were going to be mar- 
ried in March.” 

“I know,” said Ferdie sympa- 
thetically, “but if it’s any con- 
solation, you’re going to be so 
busy from now on that you won’t 
have much time to think about it. 
Karl sent me over to pick you 
up because we’re pulling out to- 
night. Which reminds me, I’d 
better call old Kleinholtz and 
tell him he’ll have to find himself 
a new lab technician. Mind if I 
use your phone?” 

Jan shook his head mutely and 
gestured toward the hallway. 



t|^WO minutes later, Ferdie was 
back. “The old boy gave me 
a rough time,” he said. “Wanted 
to know why I was walking out 
on him just when the apparatus 
was about ready for testing. I 
told him I had a sudden attack 
of itchy feet and there wasn’t 
much I could do about it.” He 
shrugged. “Well, the rough 
work’s done, anyway. About all 
that’s left is running the compu- 
tations and I couldn’t handle 
that if I wanted to. It’s strange, 
Jan — I’ve spent a whole year 
helping him put that gadget to- 
gether, and I still don’t know 
what it’s for. I asked him again 
just now and the tight-mouthed 
old son of a gun just laughed at 
me and said that if I knew which 
side my bread was buttered on, 
I’d get back to work in a hurry. 
I guess it’s pretty big. It’s a 
shame I won’t be around to see 
it.” He moved toward the win- 
dow. “We'd better be on our way, 
Jan. The rest will be waiting for 
us.” 

Jan stood irresolute and then 
slowly shook his head. “I’m not 
going.” 

“What?” 

“You heard me. I’m not go- 
ing.” 

Ferdie went over to him and 
took him gently by the arm. 
“Come on now, boy. I know it’s 
hard, but you’ve made your de- 
cision and you’ve got to stick to 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it. You can’t pull back now.” 
Jan turned away sullenly. 
“You can all go to hell! I’m 
going after her.” 

“Don’t be a fool. No woman is 
worth that much.” 

“She is to me. I have been a 
fool, but I’m not going to be any 
longer. I was a pretty happy guy 
before you people came along. I 
had a job I liked and a girl I 
loved and the future looked good. 
If I back-track fast enough, may- 
be I’ll be able to salvage some- 
thing. Tell the rest I’ve changed 
my mind and I’m pulling out.” 
The short stocky man went 
over and poured himself another 
drink. “No, you’re not, Jan. You 
aren’t enough of a superman to 
be able to forget those poor devils 
down there.” He gestured at the 
peaceful city that spread out 
below them. 

“There won’t be any trouble in 
our time,” Jan said. 

“Or in our children’s,” agreed 
Ferdie, “but there will be in our 
grandchildren’s and then it will 
be too late. Once the row starts, 
you know how it will come out. 
You’ve got an extra something 
in your brain — use it!” 

Jan looked out into the night 
and finally turned to answer. Be- 
fore he could, an angry voice 
suddenly boomed inside his head. 

“What's holding you up over 
there? We haven't got all night!” 
“Come on,” said Ferdie. “We 



can argue later. If Karl is wound 
up enough about something to 
telepath, it must be important. 
Me, I’ll stick to the telephone. 
What’s the point to having a 
built-in tranceiver, if you have 
to put up with a splitting head- 
ache every time you use it?” He 
stepped to the window and 
climbed up on the sill. “Ready?” 
Jan hesitated and slowly 
climbed up beside him. 

“I’ll go talk to Karl, anyway,” 
he said. “Maybe you’re right, but 
it still hurts like hell.” 

“The head?” 

“No, the heart. All set?” 
Ferdie nodded. They both 
closed their eyes, tensed, and 
drifted slowly up into the night. 

ARL was stretched out on the 
couch with his head in Mir- 
anda’s lap and a look of suffering 
on his face. She was gently mas- 
saging his temples. 

“Next time use a telephone,” 
said Ferdie as he and Jan came 
in. 

Karl sat up suddenly. “What 
took you so long?” 

“What do you mean, so long? 
An aircab would have got us here 
a lot quicker, but we’re supermen 
— we’ve got to levitate.” 

“I’m not amused,” said Karl. 
“Are you all set?” 

Ferdie nodded. “All ties brok- 
en and everything prepared for 
a neat and tidy disappearance.” 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“And him?” Karl looked nar- 
rowly at Jan. 

“He’s all right.” 

“Yeah, I’m fine,” said Jan. 
“Girl and job dumped down the 
drain. Do you want the details? 
Ferdie’s boss figured he’d be 
back. He said Ferdie knew which 
side his bread was buttered on. 
My girl didn’t say anything; she 
just slammed the door in my 
face. And now that that’s over, if 
you’ll just detail me a female 
I’ll start breeding little super- 
men for you. How about Mir- 
anda? She’s one of the elect.” 
“Climb off it, Jan,” Karl said 
sharply. “We know it wasn’t 
easy, but dramatics won’t help.” 
Jan threw himself sullenly into 
an overstuffed chair and stared 
morosely at the ceiling. 

Karl pulled himself to his feet 
and made a quick survey of the 
room. “. thirty-seven, thirty- 
eight — I guess we’re all here. Go 
ahead, Henry. You’ve got the 
floor.” 

A tall, prematurely gray man 
began to speak quietly. “It’s got 
to be tonight. There is heavy 
cloud cover over Alta Pass that 
goes up to twenty thousand feet. 
If we’re careful, we should be 
able to take off without detec- 
tion. I suggest we leave at once. 
It’ll take some time to move the 
ship out of the cave and we 
want to be on our way before 
the weather clears.” 



“Check,” said Karl. He turned 
to Miranda. “You know your 
job. The ship will be back to 
pick up the new crop in ten 
months or so.” 

"I still think you should leave 
somebody else behind,” she ob- 
jected. “I can’t listen twenty-four 
hours a day.” 

“You’re just looking for com- 
pany,” Karl said impatiently. 
“The unconscious mental signals 
that mark the change go on for 
a week or more before the indi- 
vidual knows anything is hap- 
pening. You’ll have plenty of 
time to make contact.” 

“Oh, all right, but don’t forget 
to send a relief back for me. It’s 
going to be lonely with all of you 
gone.” 

Karl gave, her a short but af- 
fectionate kiss. “Okay, gang, let’s 
go.” 

T HE engine room of the ship 
consisted simply of an oval 
table with ten bucket seats 
spaced equidistantly around it. 
At the moment, only one of 
them was occupied. Ferdie sat 
there, his eyes closed and his 
face pale and tense. As a hand 
touched his shoulder, he jumped, 
and for a moment the ship quiv- 
ered slightly until the new mind 
took over. 

Ferdie ran his hands through 
his hair and then pressed them 
against his aching temples. Then

63 



he stood up. There was a slight 
stagger to his walk as he pulled 
himself up the ladder into the 
forward observation room. 

“Rough shift?” said Jan. 

Ferdie groaned. “They’re all 
rough. If I’d known how much 
work was going to be involved in 
this superman stuff. I’d have ar- 
ranged to be born to different 
parents. You may think there is 
something romantic about drag- 
ging this tin ark through hyper- 
space by sheer mental pressure, 
but to me it feels like the old 
horse-and-buggy days with me as 
the horse. Mental muscle, physi- 
cal muscle — what's the differ- 
ence? It’s still plain hard work. 
Give me an old-fahioned ma- 
chine where I can sit back and 
push buttons.” 

"Maybe this was your last 
turn at the table.” Jan looked out 
at the gray nothingness on the 
other side of the observation 
port. “Karl says we’re due to 
pull out of warp this evening.” 

“And by the time we look 
around and find that Alpha Cen- 
tauri has no suitable planets, 
it’ll be my turn to pull us back 
in again.” 

¥ ATE that evening, a bell 
clanged through the ship. A 
moment later, all ten seats in the 
engine room were occupied. 

“Brace yourself and grab 
hold,” snapped Karl. “This is go- 



ing to take a heap of twisting." 

It did. Three times, figures col- 
lapsed and were quickly replaced 
by those waiting behind them, 
but at last they broke through 
into normal space. With a sigh of 
relief, they all relaxed. Karl 
reached over and switched on 
the ship intercom. 

“How does she look up there, 
Ferdie?” 

“Alpha Centauri blazing dead 
ahead.” There was a slight pause. 
“Also there’s a small man in a 
derby hat directly off the star- 
board bow.” 

Those in the engine room de- 
serted their posts and made a 
mad dash for the forward obser- 
vation compartment. Ferdie was 
standing as if transfixed, staring 
raptly out into space. As Karl 
came up and grabbed his arm, he 
pointed with a shaking finger. 

“Look!” 

Karl looked. A plump little 
figure wearing a severly cut bus- 
iness suit, high -buttoned shoes, 
spats, and a derby hat was float- 
ing a scant five yards from the 
observation port. He waved 
cheerily at them and then open- 
ing the briefcase he carried, re- 
moved a large sheet of paper. He 
held it up and pointed to the 
words lettered on it in large 
black print. 

“What does it say?” demand- 
ed Karl. “My eyes don’t seem to 
be working.” 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Ferdie squinted. “This is in- 
sanity/’ 

“It says that?” 

“No, I do. It says, ‘May I 
come on board?’ ” 

“What do you think?” 

“I think we’re both crazy, but 
if he wants to, I say let him.” 

K ARL made a gesture of as- 
sent to the figure floating 
outside and pointed aft to the 
airlock. The little man shook 
his head, unbuttoned his vest, 
and reached inside it. He twid- 
dled with something for a mo- 
ment and then disappeared. A 
split-second later, he was stand- 
ing in the middle of the obser- 
vation compartment. He took off 
his hat and bowed politely to 
the jaw-dropped group. 

“Your servant, gentlemen. My 
name is Thwiskumb — Ferzial 
Thwiskumb. I’m with Gliterslie, 
Quimbat and Swench, Exporters. 
I was on my way to Formalhaut 
on a customer service call when 
I noted an odd disturbance in 
sub-ether, so I stopped for a mo- 
ment to see what would come 
out. You’re from Sol, aren’t 
you?” 

Karl nodded dumbly. 
“Thought so,” said the little 
man. “Do you mind if I ask your 
destination?” 

He had to repeat the question 
before he was able to get a co- 
herent answer. Ferdie was the 



first to recover enough from 
shock to say anything. 

“We were hoping to find a 
habitable planet in the Alpha 
Centauri system.” 

Mr. Thwiskumb pursed his 
lips. “There is one, but there are 
difficulties. It’s reserved for the 
Primitives, you see. I don’t know 
how the Galactic Council would 
view settlement. Of course, the 
population has been shrinking of 
late and there’s practically no- 
body left on the southern conti- 
nent.” He stopped and thought. 
“Tell you what I’ll do. When I 
get to Formalhaut, I’ll give the 
Sector Administrator a call and 
see what he has to say. And now 
if you’ll excuse me, I don’t want 
to be late for my appointment. 
Gliterslie, Quimbat and Swench 
pride themselves on their punc- 
tuality.” 

He was reaching inside his vest 
again when Karl grabbed his 
arm. The flesh felt reassuringly 
solid. 

“Have we gone insane?” beg- 
ged the leader. 

“Oh, dear me, of course not,” 
said Mr. Thwiskumb, disengag- 
ing himself gently. “You’re just 
a few thousand years behind on 
the development cycle. The mi- 
gration of the Superiors from our 
home planet took place when 
your people were still in the pro- 
cess of discovering the use of 
fire.”

“Migration?” repeated Karl 
blankly. 

“The same thing you’re off 
on.” said the little man. He re- 
moved his glasses and polished 
them carefully. “The mutations 
that follow the release of atomic 
power almost always end up in 
the evolution of a group with 
some sort of control over the 
terska force. Then the problem 
of future relations with the Nor- 
mals comes up, and the Superiors 
quite often decide on a secret mi- 
gration to avoid future conflict. 
It’s a mistake, though. When you 
take a look at Centauri III, you’ll 
see what I mean. I’m afraid 
you’ll find it a depressing place.” 

Placing his derby firmly on his 
head, he gave a genial wave of 
farewell and disappeared. 

A wild look was in Karl’s eyes 
as he held up his arms for si- 
lence. 

“There’s just one thing I want 
to know,” he said. “Have I or 
have I not been talking to a 
small man in a derby hat for 
the past five minutes?” 

t'ORTY-EIGHT hours later, 
they pulled away from Cen- 
tauri III and parked in free space 
until they could decide what they 
wanted to do. It was a depress- 
ed and confused group that gath- 
ered in the forward observation 
compartment to discuss their fu- 
ture. 



“There’s no use wasting time 
now talking about what we saw 
down there,” said Karl. “What 
we’ve got to decide is whether 
we’re going to push on to other 
solar systems until we find a 
planet that will suit our needs, 
or whether we are going to re- 
turn to Earth.” 

A little red-headed girl waved 
her hand. 

“Yes, Martha?” Karl said. 

“I think we are going to have 
to talk about what we saw down 
there. If our leaving Earth means 
that we are condemning it to a 
future like that, we’re going to 
have to go back.” 

There was an immediate ob- 
jection from a tense young man 
in horn-rimmed glasses. 

“Whether we go back or ahead 
will make little difference in our 
lifetimes, so we can’t be accused 
of personal selfishness if we don’t 
return to Earth. The people it 
will make a difference to are our 
descendants. That strange little 
man who materialized among us 
two days ago and then vanished 
is a concrete demonstration of 
what they can be — if we stay 
apart and develop the new pow- 
ers that have been given us. I 
say the welfare of the new super- 
race is more important than that 
of the Ordinaries we left behind !” 

There was a short muttering of 
agreement as he sat down. 

“Next?” Karl asked.

Half a dozen people tried to 
get the floor at once, but Ferdie 
managed to get recognized. 

“I say go back!” he stated. 
"And since the previous speaker 
was talking about accusations, 
let me say that I can’t be accused 
of personal bias, either. As far 
as I’m concerned, I would just 
as soon spend the next several 
years cruising around to the far 
corners to see what's up. But 
the longer we’re gone, the harder 
it will be to fit ourselves back 
into normal society. 

"Look, we left Earth because 
we thought it was the best thing 
for mankind. And when I say 
mankind, I mean the Normals, 
the parent race. What we saw 
down there — ” he gestured in the 
direction of Centauri III — “is 
dramatic proof that we were 
wrong. It would seem that a scat- 
tering of Superiors is somehow 
necessary to keep human society 
from collapsing. Maybe we act 
as a sort of essential catalyst or 
something. Whatever it is, we're 
needed. If we walk out on Man, 
we’ll never be able to live with 
ourselves in our brave new 
world.” 

T/ - ARL looked worried. “I think 
I agree with you,” he said, 
“but if we go back, we’ll be 
dumped into the old problem of 
future relations again. Right now 
there are so few of us that if 



we were found out, we’d be look- 
ed upon as freaks. But what’s 
going to happen when our num- 
bers start to shoot up? Any 
group that has special powers is 
suspect, and I don’t relish the 
thought of condemning our de- 
scendants to a world where 
they’ll have to kill or be killed." 

"If worst comes to worst, they 
can always take off the way we 
did.” replied Ferdie. "But I’d 
like to point out that migration 
was the first solution proposed 
and the one we’ve given all our 
attention to. There must be other 
ways out, if we look for them. 
We’ve got to give it a try, any- 
way.” He turned to the young 
man in the horn-rimmed glasses. 
"How about it, Jim?” 

The other nodded reluctantly. 
"I’m dubious, but maybe we 
should go back and make the try 
you’ve been talking about.” His 
voice sharpened. "Under one 
condition, though. If the Nor- 
mals start to give us any trouble, 
we get out again!” 

"I’ll agree to that,” said Ferdie. 
"How about the rest of you?” 
"Let’s make it official." said 
Karl. “All in favor of returning?” 
The ayes had it. 

There was a sound of polite 
applause from the doorway. Mr. 
Thwiskumb had returned. "A 
very wise decision,” he said, 
"very wise. It demonstrates a 
commendable social maturity. I

am sure your descendants will 
thank you for it.” 

“I don’t know what for,” said 
Karl sadly. “We’re robbing them 
of all the things that you have. 
Instantaneous teleportation, for 
example. It’s no particular sacri- 
fice for us — we’re just starting to 
develop the powers within us — 
but it will be for them. I don’t 
know if we are right, asking them 
to pay such a price.” 

“What about the other price?” 
demanded Ferdie. “What about 
that scrawny grimy gang down 
on Centauri III, sitting apathe- 
tically in the hot sun and scratch- 
ing themselves? We also have no 
right to condemn the Ordinaries 
to a future like that.” 

“Oh, you wouldn’t be doing 
that,” said Mr. Thwiskumb mild- 
ly. “Those people down there 
aren’t Ordinaries.” 

“What!” 

“Dear me, no. They weren’t 
the ones that were left behind. 
They are the descendants of 
those who migrated. Those poor 
devils down there are pure-blood- 
ed Superiors. When they ran into 
the limiting factor, they just gave 
up.” 

“Then what accounts for you? 
You’re obviously a Superior.” 

“HPHAT’s a very kind thing to 
say,” answered the little 
man, “but I’m just as ordinary 
as anyone can be. We’re all Or- 



dinaries where I come from. Our 
Superiors left a long time ago.” 
He chuckled. “It’s a funny thing 
— at the time, we didn’t know 
they were gone, so we didn’t miss 
them. We just went about busi- 
ness as usual. Later, we found 
them, but it was already too late. 
You see, the big difference was 
that we had an unlimited area of 
development and they didn’t. 
There’s no limit to the machine, 
but there is to the human organ- 
ism. No matter how much train- 
ing you have, there is a limit to 
how loud you can shout. After 
that, you have to get yourself 
an amplifier. 

“A slight neural rearrangement 
makes it possible for you to tap 
and control certain sources of 
physical energy that aren’t di- 
rectly available to the ordinary 
man of your planet, but you are 
still dealing with natural forces 
. and natural organic limits. 
There is a point beyond which 
you can’t go without the aid of 
the machine, an organic limiting 
factor. But after several genera- 
tions spefit in mastering what is 
inside your heads, rather than 
struggling for control of the 
world around you, and the time 
comes when your natural limits 
are reached, the very concept of 
the machine has been lost. Then 
where do you go from there?” 

He waited for an answer, but 
nobody offered one.

“There is an old story in our 
folklore,” he continued, “about 
a boy who bought himself an 
animal somewhat like your ter- 
restrial calf. He thought that if 
he lifted it above his head ten 
times a day while it was little, 
he would build up his strength 
gradually until he would still be 
able to lift it over his head when 
it was a full-grown animal. He 
soon discovered the existence of 
a natural limiting factor. Do you 
see what I mean? When those 
people down there reached their 
natural limits, there was no place 
for them to go but backward. 
We had the machine, though, and 
the machine can always be 
made smaller and better, so we 
had no stopping point.” 

He reached inside his vest and 
pulled out a small shining object 
about the size of a cigarette case. 
“This is hooked by a tight beam 
to the great generators on Al- 
tair. Of course I 'wouldn’t, but I 
could move planets with it if I 
wanted to. It’s simply a matter 



of applying a long enough lever, 
and the lever, if you’ll remember, 
is a simple machine.” 

Karl looked dazed. In fact, 
everyone did. 

“Yeah,” he muttered, “yeah, I 
see what you mean.” He turned 
to the group. “All right, let’s get 
back to the engine room. We’ve 
got a long flight ahead of us.” 
“How long?” asked the little 
man. 

“Four months if we push it.” 
“Shocking waste of time.” 

“I suppose you can do better?” 
Karl inquired belligerently. 

“Oh, dear me, yes.” said Mr. 
Thwiskumb. “It would take me 
about a minute and a half. You 
Superiors dawdle so — I’m glad 
I’m normal.” 

J AN was doing a happy little 
dance through his apartment 
when his buzzer rang. He opened 
the door and Ferdie stepped in. 

“I came up on the elevator,” 
he said. “It’s a lot easier on the 
nerves. My, you look pleased

with yourself. I know why, too 
— I saw her coming out of the 
lobby when I came in. She walk- 
ed as if she were wearing clouds 
instead of shoes.” 

Jan did a little caper. “We’re 
getting married next week and 
I got my job back.” 

“I got mine back, too,” said 
Ferdie. “Old Kleinholtz gave me 
a little lecture about walking 
out on him when work was at 
its heaviest, but he was too pleas- 
ed with himself to do more than 
a perfunctory job. When he took 
me back into the lab, I saw why. 
He’s finally got his gadget run- 
ning.” 

“What did it turn out to be? 
A time machine?” 

Ferdie grinned mysteriously. 
“Something almost as good. It 
lifts things.” 

“What kind of things?” 

“Any kind. Even people. Old 
Kleinholtz had a little set of 
controls rigged up that he could 
strap to his chest. He turned the 
machine on and went flying 
around the lab like a bird.” 
Jan’s jaw dropped. “The way 
we do?” 

“Just the same, boy. He’s 



found a way to tap the terska 
force. Really tap it, not suck 
little driblets out, as we do. An- 
other ten years and the Ordi- 
naries will be able to do anything 
we can do, only better. And a 
good thing, too. Telepathy gives 
us headaches, and levitation is a 
pleasant Sunday afternoon pas- 
time, but hardly something to 
build a civilization on. As Mr. 
Thwiskumb said, the machine 
has no natural limits, so I guess 
our worries about the future are 
over. Nobody is going to be un- 
happy about us being able to 
fly thirty miles an hour when 
they can make it instantaneous. 
Looks like superman is obsolete 
before he even had a chance to 
get started.” 

He stretched his arms and 
yawned. “Guess I’d better get 
home and hit the sack. It’s going 
to be a busy day at the lab to- 
morrow." 

He walked over to the open 
window and looked out. 

“Flying home?” asked Jan. 

Ferdie grinned and shook his 
head. “I’m waiting until the new 
improved model comes out.”

THE CASE OF THE 
LYING STONES 

I F this piece has any moral at 
all, it should be construed as 
a lecture on credulity. Not 
only should you be careful believ- 
ing what you hear and read, you 
can’t even always trust “tangible 
evidence.” Of course tangible evi- 
dence is evidence all right, but 
there still remains the question: 
“evidence for what?” But let’s 
proceed with what is probably 
the worst recorded case of mis-

leading evidence in all history. 

The year was 1710 A.D. The 
place was the city of Wurzburg, 
the capital of Lower Franconia, 
in southwestern Germany. Wurz- 
burg has a university that is fa- 
mous for several reasons. One of 
these reasons is that it was found- 
ed twice, once in 1403 and once 
in 1582. Another reason is that 
this is the place where Dr. Wil- 
helm Konrad Rontgen discover- 
ed his Rontgen rays or X-rays 
in 1896. And the third reason for 
its fame is the case I am going 
to talk about. 

In 1710, some people informed 
the professors of the university 
that they had found an enormous 
bone, as hard and heavy as stone 
and so huge that only a giant 
could have been its original pos- 
sessor. A few days later, several 
men, groaning and sweating, car- 




ried the bone up the steps and 
placed it on a sturdy oaken table. 
The professors of the university 
were not as happy about this as 
professors of a modern university 
would be. They would have pre- 
ferred to close their eyes, but the 
government had asked for an 
opinion and there was nothing 
else they could do but give one. 

The professors met in a formal 
council and, since the object did 
seem to be a bone, the Professor 
of Medicine was the logical chair- 
man. His name was Johann Bar- 
tholomaeus Adam Beringer. 

rpHE bone was actually the fos- 
silized relic of a member of 
the elephant tribe which had liv- 
ed in the area of Wurzburg some 
10 or 15 million years earlier. But 
the council of professors, prodded 
by its chairman, arrived at the 




72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




conclusion that this was a lusus 
naturae. The term they used may 
be rendered in English as “play 
of Nature,” but what they had 
in mind when they used it will 
probably remain a mystery for 
all time to come. 

Fossils, in those days, were 
recognized for what they really 
were by only a few advanced 
thinkers. Most of the savants held 
a vague kind of belief of a min- 
eral creation paralleling animate 
creation, but did not agree with 
each other on how it had come 
about. A few thought that, under 
special circumstances, a plant 
seed or a fish egg might develop 
in a mineral environment, pro- 
ducing a mineral plant or mineral 
fish. Others suggested a vapidly 
mystical life-giving mist coming 
from the sea. Still others held as- 
trological influences responsible. 



And some said that the mineral 
creation may have been the result 
of God's practicing with mineral 
matter before He progressed to 
animate creation. 

But all the proponents of these 
conflicting beliefs presented a 
united front against the fantastic 
heretics who said that a fossil 
fish probably once was a live fish 
before it became a fossil. As for 
the Professor medicinae Beringer, 
he was convinced that such an 
explanation was sheerest non- 
sense and he lectured his students 
on “plays of Nature.” The stu- 
dents were perfectly willing to 
absorb their professor’s opinions. 
They went along with the first 
repetition and the next. They had, 
after all, enrolled to study medi- 
cine. 

At about that time, Prof. Ber- 
inger started looking for fossils, 








presumably to have more mate- 
rial for his interminable argu- 
ments. There are fossils in the 
Wurzburg area, but Prof. Ber- 
inger happened to have a very 
special kind of luck. One day he 
came home with a slab of stone 
showing in unmistakably clear 
bas relief the picture of a comet. 
Maybe those who thought that 
astrological influences caused the 
“plays of Nature” were not so 
wrong, after all. Some time later, 
he found a stone slab with a 
crescent moon. Then another 
comet. Then a whole bird, com- 
plete with egg. 

The more diligently Prof. Ber- 
inger dug in his favorite place, 
the more astonishing the results. 
Strange animals that nobody had 
ever seen alive and which were 
not mentioned in even the biggest 
natural history books. Enormous 
spiders and their webs. And one 
day a stone slab with Hebrew let- 
ters. 

Like other scholars of his time, 
Prof. Beringer had been taught 
three classical languages: Latin, 
Greek and Hebrew. These let- 
ters seemed to spell the name of 
God. 

In so important a matter, Prof. 
Beringer did not wish to rely on 
his own knowledge alone. He got 
in touch with the rabbi of a near- 
by Jewish community and the 
rabbi confirmed his opinion — the 
letters did spell the name of God! 



T>ERINGER hired an artist to 
make careful drawings of his 
finds, then an engraver to trans- 
fer the drawings to plates. Mean- 
while, he wrote a book — in Latin, 
of course — of fourteen chapters, 
with a long preface and a nine- 
page dedication to 'Dr. Christo- 
pher Francis, the Prince Bishop 
of Wurzburg. Since Beringer was 
not at all secretive about his 
work, everybody around the uni- 
versity knew about it. He had 
friends who tried to make him 
realize that he had been hoaxed. 
A few students even confessed 
that they had made the “lying 
stones” that Beringer had dug up. 
His friends quoted the case of 
Father Athanasius Kircher, S. J., 
who had also taught at Wurzburg 
for a while and who had been 
similarly hoaxed by his students. 

Beringer grew indignant. All 
this “friendly” advice and the 
student’s confessions were merely 
part of a plot to rob him of the 
glory of his discovery. He fin- 
ished his book and it appeared 
in 1726 under the title Lithogra- 
phiae Wirceburgensis. 

The laughter that greeted the 
publication was unanimous. And, 
it is said, at the same time Ber- 
inger was confronted with a stone 
on which he could read his own 
name in "fossil” Hebrew letters. 
Shocked, he spent what money 
he had trying to buy up all avail- 
able copies of his expensive work. 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Fourteen years after the publi- 
cation of the book that was to 
make him famous — and did, in a 
way — Beringer died. By then the 
book was famous in itself and a 
bookseller in Hamburg bought 
all the copies left in the hands of 
the original publisher and sold 
them. They sold so briskly, in 
fact, that another edition was 
printed in 1767. 

There can be no doubt that 
no man has ever been more tho- 
roughly hoaxed than Beringer. 
It is still doubtful just why. That 
students made the “lying stones” 
is certain, but whether they did 
this as a joke or whether some 
unknown enemy of Beringer’s was 
behind the whole cruel deception 
has never been cleared up. * 

In 1940, the University of 
Wurzburg still had 30 of the orig- 
inal “lying stones” in its collec- 
tion. I have not been able to find 
out what has happened to them 
since. But copies of the book are 
in many large libraries. 

THE IRON PILLAR OF DELHI 

O LD Cajus Plinius Secundus, 
or Pliny the Elder, as he 
is often called to distinguish him 
from Pliny the Younger (who 
was his nephew), indulged in one 
of his comparatively rare philo- 
sophical speculations when, in the 
course of writing his monumental 
Natural History, he came to the 



subject of iron. Iron, he said, is 
useful for building houses, cleav- 
ing rocks and for many other 
purposes. But it is also used by 
robbers and for war. 

However, he continued, “Na- 
ture, in conformity with her usual 
benevolence, has limited the pow- 
er of iron by inflicting upon it the 
punishment of rust; and has thus 
displayed her usual foresight in 
rendering nothing in existence 
more perishable than the sub- 
stance which brings the greatest 
dangers upon perishable mor- 
tality.” 

The modern engineer may not 
be too convinced about the “us- 
ual benevolence of Nature,” but 
he is still fully aware of the “pun- 
ishment of rust.” Much of what 
goes under the general term of 
maintenance is the effort to 
counteract this fact. Our big 
bridges are tended by permanent 
groups of painters; by the time 
they have finished painting at 
one' end, it is time to start again 
at the other. And everybody 
know what happens to a piece of 
machinery that is left outdoors 
for a year. 

But while everybody has been 
reconciled to the fact that the 
“punishment of rust” existed, 
there seemed to be a nagging ex- 
ample, apparently pointing out 
that things did not have to be 
that way. 

In the city of Delhi — more spe- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



75 



cifically, in the so-called Old 
City, which is some ten miles 
from the modern section — there 
stands an impressive old tower. 
Its name is Kutb-Minar and it 
was built to commemorate the 
victories of an old Mohammedan 
general whose name was Kutb- 
ud-din. The tower is 238 feet tall 
and is built of colored sandstone, 
with red sandstone at the bottom 
that gradually changes to bright 
orange sandstone at the top. Part 
of this monument is an iron pil- 
lar. 

This Iron Pillar is untended in 
the sense that nothing was ever 
done to prevent it from rusting. 
The Iron Pillar is virtually un- 
corroded in spite of lack of care. 
And it is almost 1500 years old. 

For almost two centuries, the 
Iron Pillar of Delhi has been 
quoted as an example of iron that 
does not rust. As is usually the 
case when the real reason for 
something is unknown, the rust- 
resistance of the Iron Pillar in- 
spired multitudes of conjectures. 
The most obvious and least prov- 
able idea was, of course, that this 
was an example of a “lost art.” 
Presumably some Moslem sav- 
ant, or armorer, or even a simple 
blacksmith, had found a method 
of making iron rustproof by the 
addition of some now forgotten 
substance. Or, which would be 
even harder to establish, by a 
process of treatment. 



Another idea — the one I heard 
from a professor of mine when 
I was a student — was that the 
Iron Pillar might be rustproof 
because of the absence of all ad- 
ditions. All the iron we use, from 
steel beams to razor blades, is 
chemically “impure” — it contains 
various additions, ranging from 
other metals like vanadium to 
simple carbon and silicon. In fact, 
it is very hard to produce iron 
that has almost no impurities. So 
the reasoning ran that somebody 
in the Moslem world of 1500 
years ago had hit, evidently by 
a lucky chance, upon absolutely 
pure iron. And it was postulated 
that absolutely pure iron would 
not rust. 

That assertion is doubtful, to 
say the least. But the mystery of 
the Iron Pillar has been solved. 

Everybody had been looking in 
the wrong direction. People had 
studied the pillar instead of its 
surroundings. After a careful sur- 
vey made by J. C. Hudson of the 
British Iron and Steel Research 
Association, it seems that the fa- 
mous pillar is still standing in 
Delhi because of the dry climate. 
According to Hudson, there is 
virtually no rusting as long as the 
relative humidity of the air is 
less than 70 per cent. And at 
Delhi that humidity is very rare- 
ly even approached. 

No “lost art.” Nothing that is 
in any way mysterious or impres-

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Many stars, perhaps the ma-

Has it been established that an 
orbit stable enough, as well as 
suitable in other respects, can 
exist for a hypothetical planet to

life in these systems? If so, have 
any general requirements for the 
systems been laid down?

Offhand, I can think of three 
kinds of stable orbits in double- 
star systems, depending on the 
type of system. 

If we have a close double 
with the two stars not much 
more than one star-diameter — 
say, one million miles — apart, 
planets at a distance of about 
100 star-diameters will orbit 
around the pair as if it were a 
single star. 

On the other hand, if the 
two stars forming the binary 
are 1,000 star-diameters apart, 
each star could have a family 
of planets that would be only 
slightly perturbed by the other 
star. 

Finally, there is a possibility 
that the two stars are about 100 
or 150 star-diameters apart and 
that one of them is several 



times as massive as the other. In 
this case, a planet could well 
revolve around the larger of the 
two in an equilateral (“Tro- 
jan”) position. 

Planets in stable orbits are 
therefore possible in binary 
star systems. 

The V-2 rocket as used against 
London in the last war had, I 
understand, a mass-ratio of about 
3 1/2. What is the mass-ratio of 
the most efficient rocket devel- 
oped in the USA since and what 
effect does the two-step rocket 
have upon the overall mass-ratio?

Since the weight of the struc- 
ture of the V-2 rocket was (in 
rounded-off figures) 3 tons, the 
weight of the payload one ton 
and the weight of the fuels 8 
tons, the mass-ratio of the V-2 
was almost precisely 3:1. The 
mass-ratio of the Viking rocket, 
of less overall weight, is very 
close to 4:1. 

In step rockets, the final 
velocities attained by the vari- 
ous steps add up, which has 
the same result as if the mass- 
ratios were multiplied. Imagine 
that the lower step is a V-2 with 
its 3:1 mass-ratio and that the 
payload carried is a smaller 
rocket, which also has a mass-

ratio of 3:1. The final velocity 
reached by the second step is 
equivalent to a rocket of the 
mass-ratio of 9:1. 

But a mass-ratio of 9:1 
would strain the resources and 
the ingenuity of the designing 
engineer to the utmost, while it 
is comparatively easy to build 
two rockets, each with a mass- 
ratio of 3:1. 

Having read a great deal about 
gigantic stars like Mira, I wonder 
which star is regarded as the 
smallest star. Also, if we found 
a lonely body in space which is 
not luminous, would it be called 
a planet because it does not shine 
or would it be called a dead star 
if it is big enough? 

Gerd Lipschitz 

Trenton, N. J. 

For a number of years, a star 
catalogued as “BD -j- 4° 4048,” 
discovered at the McDonald 
Observatory, Texas, was believ- 
ed to be the faintest known star. 
It was, in fact, the faintest 
known star from 1944 until 
1952, when Drs. Luyten and 
Carpenter, working at the Stew- 
ard Observatory, Arizona, es- 
tablished a still fainter star. Its 
luminosity is so low that 60,000 
of its kind would be needed to 
give off as much light as our 
sun. And its diameter is only 
about 300 miles larger than 
the diameter of our moon, 



which is 2160 miles. But this 
tiny star, catalogued as L886-6, 
has 40 per cent more mass than 
our sun, which means that its 
density must be some 55 mil- 
lion times the density of water! 

As for your second question, 
it is this high density that would 
be used as a criterion when a 
large dark body is found. If 
this body, as you specify, is 
not luminous, but had such a 
high density, it would obviously 
be a dead star. If it had a dens- 
ity comparable to that of the 
planets, which ranges from not 
quite 1 for Saturn to 5.5 for 
Earth, it would have to be con- 
sidered a planet that was some- 
how torn from its sun. 

Whether there are actually 
non-luminous dead stars is 
doubtful. The so-called super- 
dense ‘‘White Dwarfs,” of 
which the two faint stars men- 
tioned above are examples, are 
regarded as the end of stellar 
evolution and may be called 
“dead” in the sense that they 
no longer generate energy and 
have nothing left with which to 
do so. But they are still hot 
because they have not yet had 
time to cool off and turn dark 
in the process. Because of their 
large (and hot) mass and their 
small surface area, they cool 
very slowly. 

The time needed to cool is 
estimated to be longer than the 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



present age of our universe. If 
this reasoning is correct, as it 
appears to lie in the light of 
present knowledge, no star has 
been able to cool to tempera- 
tures below visibility. 

1 have just read your article 
on the " Trojan Planets” and 
would like it very much if you 
wrote an article on the moons of 
Jupiter. All l know about them 
are the names of the four largest 
ones. What are the names, sizes 
and distances of the others? 

John Slivka 
58 Greenwood Avenue 
Lackawanna 18, N. Y. 

The moons of Jupiter, ex- 
cept for the four largest, which 
have been known since 1610, 
have never been named. They 
are designated by Roman num- 
erals preceded by a J. Because 
they are numbered in the order 
of discovery, their sequence, 
counting from Jupiter outward, 
reads J-V, J-I (Io), J-II (Eur- 
opa), J-III (Ganymede), J-IV 
(Callisto), J-VI, J-VII, J-X, J-XI, 
J-VIII, J-IX, J-XII. 

Jupiter's moons clearly form 
two main groups, with J-V as a 
special case defying classifica- 
tion. J-V is only 112,600 miles 
from the planet, needs half a 
day for one complete revolu- 
tion and has a diameter of 
about 100 miles. 



Then comes the inner group 
of moons, those which have 
names. They are big. Io has a 
diameter of 2300 miles, Eur- 
opa a diameter of 2000 miles, 
and Ganymede and Callisto are 
of equal size, 3200 miles in 
diameter (200 miles more than 
Mercury). Their distances are, 
respectively, 261,800, 416,600, 
664,200 and 1,169,000 miles, 
and their periods of revolution 
1.77, 3.55, 7.15 and 16.7 days, 
respectively. 

The outer moons are all ra- 
ther small and again form two 
groups. J-VI, J-VII and J-X are 
between 7,100,000 and 7,350,- 
000 miles from the planet, 
needing between 250 and 260 
days for one revolution. J-VI 
has a diameter of 100 miles, 
the other two less than 50 miles 
apiece. 

Another group is formed by 
J-XI, J-VIII, J-IX and J-XII, 
all small bodies of less than 50 
miles in diameter at distances 
of between 14 and 14.9 mil- 
lion miles from Jupiter. Their 
periods of revolution are be- 
tween 660 and 760 days. 

In all probability, the group 
or groups of outer moons are 
far more numerous than we 
know, but the other members 
are too small to be discovered 
from Earth.

Endeavor I was a space jalopy. Endeavor II 
was a dreamboat—with built-in nightmares! 



T HE ship’s mass detector 
flared pink, then red. Agee 
had been dozing at the con- 
trols, waiting for Victor to finish 
making dinner. Now he looked up 
quickly. “Planet coming,” he 
called, over the hiss of escaping 
air. 

Captain Barnett nodded. He 
finished shaping a hot patch, and 
slapped it on Endeavor’s worn 
hull. The whistle of escaping air 
dropped to a low moan, but was 
not entirely stopped. It never 
was.

When Barnett came over, the 
planet was just visible beyond 
the rim of a little red sun. It 
glowed green against the black 
night of space and gave both men 
an identical thought. 

Barnett put the thought into 
words. “Wonder if there’s any- 
thing on it worth taking,” he said, 
frowning. 

Agee lifted a white eyebrow 
hopefully. They watched as the 
dials began to register. 

They would never have spotted 
the planet if they had taken En- 
deavor along the South Galactic 
Trades. But the Confederacy Po- 
lice were becoming increasingly 
numerous along that route and 
Barnett preferred to give them a 
wide berth. 

The Endeavor was listed as a 
trader — but the only cargo she 
carried consisted of several bot- 
tles of an extremely powerful 
acid used in opening safes, and 
three medium-sized atomic 
bombs. The authorities looked 
with disfavor upon such goods 
and they were always trying to 
haul in the crew on some old 
charge — a murder on Luna, lar- 
ceny on Omega, breaking and en- 
tering on Sarnia II. Old, almost 
forgotten crimes that the police 
drearily insisted on raking up. 

To make matters worse, En- 
deavor was outgunned by the 
newer police cruisers. So they 
had taken an outside route to 



New Athens, where a big urani- 
um strike had opened. 

“"TVON'T look like much,” Agee 
commented, inspecting the 
dials critically. 

“Might as well pass it by,” 
Barnett said. 

The readings were uninterest- 
ing. They showed a planet small- 
er than Earth, uncharted, and 
with no commercial value other 
than oxygen atmosphere. 

As they swung past, their 
heavy-metals detector came to 
life. 

“There’s stuff down there!” 
Agee said, quickly interpreting 
the multiple readings. “Pure. 
Very pure — and on the surface!” 

He looked at Barnett, who 
nodded. The ship swung toward 
the planet. 

Victor came from the rear, 
wearing a tiny wool cap crammed 
on his big shaven head. He stared 
over Barnett’s shoulder as Agee 
brought the ship down in a tight 
spiral. Within half a mile of the 
surface, they saw their deposit 
of heavy metal. 

It was a spaceship, resting on 
its tail in a natural clearing. 

“Now this is interesting,” Bar- 
nett said. He motioned Agee to 
make a. closer approach. 

Agee brought the ship down 
with deft skill. He was well past 
the compulsory retirement limit 
for master pilots, but it didn’t 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



affect his coordination. Barnett, 
who found him stranded and pen- 
niless, had signed him on. The 
captain was always glad to help 
another human, if it was conven- 
ient and likely to be profitable. 
The two men shared the same 
attitude toward private property, 
but sometimes disagreed on ways 
of acquiring it. Agee preferred a 
sure thing. Barnett, on the other 
hand, had more courage than was 
good for a member of a relatively 
frail species like Homo sapiens. 

Near the surface of the planet, 
they saw that the strange ship 
was larger than Endeavor and 
bright, shining new. The hull 
shape was unfamiliar, as were 
the markings. 

“Ever see anything like it?” 
Barnett asked. 

Agee searched his capacious 
memory. “Looks a bit like a 
Cephean job, only they don’t 
build ’em so squat. We’re pretty 
far out, you know. That ship 
might not even be from the Con- 
federacy.” 

Victor stared at the ship, his 
big lips parted in wonder. He 
sighed noisily. “We could sure 
use a ship like that, huh, Cap- 
tain?” 

Barnett’s sudden smile was 
like a crack appearing in granite. 
“Victor,” he said, “in your sim- 
plicity, you have gone to the 
heart of the matter. We could use 
a ship like that. Let’s go down 

HANDS OFF 



and talk with its skipper.” 

Before strapping in, Victor 
made sure the freeze-blasters 
were on full charge. 

O N the ground, they sent up an 
orange and green parley 
flare, but there was no answer 
from the alien ship. The planet’s 
atmosphere tested breathable, 
with a temperature of 72 degrees 
Fahrenheit. After waiting a few 
minutes, they marched out, 
freeze-blasters ready under their 
jumpers. 

All three r*- r wore studiously 
pleasant sn? .es as they walked 
the fifty yards between ships. 

Up close, the ship was mag- 
nificent. Its glistening silver- gray 
hide had hardly been touched by 
meteor strikes. The airlock was 
open and a low hum told them 
that the generators were recharg- 
ing. 

“Anyone home?” Victor shout- 
ed into the airlock. His voice 
echoed hollowly through the 
ship. There was no answer — only 
the soft hum of the generators 
and the rustle of grass on the 
plain. 

“Where do you suppose they 
went?” Agee asked. 

“For a breath of air, probably,” 
Barnett said. “I don’t suppose 
they’d expect any visitors.” 
Victor placidly sat down on 
the ground. Barnett and Agee 
prowled around the base of the 

83 



ship, admiring its great drive 
ports. 

“Think you can handle it?” 
Barnett asked. 

“I don’t see why not,” Agee 
said. “For one thing, it’s conven- 
tional drive. The servos don’t 
matter — oxygen-breathers use 
similar drive-control systems. It’s 
just a matter of time until I fig- 
ure it out.” 

“Someone coming,” Victor 
called. 

They hurried back to the air- 
lock. Three hundred yards from 
the ship was a ragged forest. A 
figure had just emerged from 
among the trees, and was walking 
toward them. 

Agee and Victor drew their 
blasters simultaneously. 

Barnett’s binoculars resolved 
the tiny figure into a rectangular 
shape, about two feet high by a 
foot wide. The alien was less than 
two inches thick and had no head. 

Barnett frowned. He had never 
seen a rectangle floating above 
tall grass. 

Adjusting the binoculars, he 
saw that the alien was roughly 
humanoid. That is, it had four 
limbs. Two, almost hidden by the 
grass, were being used for walk- 
ing, and the other two jutted 
stiffly into the air. In its middle, 
Barnett could just make out two 
tiny eyes and a mouth. The crea- 
ture was not wearing any sort of 
suit or helmet. 



“Queer-looking,” Agee mutter- 
ed, adjusting the aperture of his 
blaster. “Suppose he’s all there 
is?” 

“Hope so,” Barnett said, draw- 
ing his own blaster. 

“Range about two hundred 
yards.” Agee leveled his weapon, 
then looked up. “Did you want 
to talk to him first, Captain?” 
“What’s there to say?” Barnett 
asked, smiling lazily. “Let him 
get a little closer, though. We 
don’t want to miss.” 

Agee nodded and kept the alien 
steadily in his sights. 

T7 ~ ALEN had stopped at this 
deserted little world, hoping 
to blast out a few tons of erol, a 
mineral highly prized by the Ma- 
bogian people. He had had no 
luck. The unused thetnite bomb 
was still lodged in his body pouch, 
next to a stray kerla nut. He 
would have to return to Mabog 
with ballast instead of cargo. 

Well, he thought, emerging 
from the forest, better luck next — 
He was shocked to see a thin, 
strangely tapered spaceship near 
his own. He had never expected 
to find anyone else on this deadly 
little world. 

And the inhabitants were wait- 
ing in front of his own airlock! 
Kalen saw at once they were 
roughly Mabogian in form. There 
was a race much like them in the 
Mabogian Union, but their space- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



84 



ships were completely different. 
Intuition suggested that these 
aliens might well be representa- 
tives of that great civilization 
rumored to be on the periphery of 
the Galaxy. 

He advanced eagerly to meet 
them. 

Strange, the aliens were not 
moving. Why didn’t they come 
forward to meet him? He knew 
that they saw him, because all 
three were pointing at him. 

He walked faster, realizing that 
he knew nothing of their customs. 
He only hoped that they didn’t 
run to long drawn-out ceremo- 
nies. Even an hour on this inimi- 
cal world had tired him. He was 
hungry, badly in need of a show- 
er .. 

Something intensely cold jar- 
red him backward. He looked 
around apprehensively. Was this 
some unknown property of the 
planet? 

He moved forward again. An- 
other bolt lanced into him, frost- 
ing the outer layer of his hide. 

This was serious. Mabogians 
were among the toughest life- 
forms in the Galaxy, but they 
had their limits. Kalen looked 
around for the source of the trou- 
ble. 

T HE aliens were shooting at 
him! 

For a moment, his thinking 
centers refused to accept the evi- 



dence of his senses. Kalen knew 
what murder was. He had ob- 
served this perversity with stun- 
ned horror among certain debased 
animal forms. And, of course, 
there were the abnormal psy- 
chology books, which document- 
ed every case of premeditated 
murder that had occurred in the 
history of Mabog. 

But to have such a thing actu- 
ally happen to him! Kalen was 
unable to believe it. 

Another bolt lanced into him. 
Kalen stood still, trying to con- 
vince himself that this was really 
happening. He couldn’t under- 
stand how creatures with suffici- 
ent sense of cooperation to run a 
spaceship could be capable of 
murder. 

Besides, they didn’t even know 
him! 

Almost too late, Kalen whirled 
and ran toward the forest. All 
three aliens were firing now and 
the grass around him was crack- 
ling white with frost. His skin 
surface was completely frosted 
over. Cold was something the 
Mabogian constitution was not 
designed for and the chill was 
creeping into his internal organs. 

But he cbuld still hardly be- 
lieve it. 

Kalen reached the forest and a 
double blast caught him as he 
slid behind a tree. He could feel 
his internal system laboring des- 
perately to restore warmth to his

body and, with profound regret, 
he allowed the darkness to take 
him. 

“OTUPID kind of alien,” Agee 
^ observed, holstering his 
blaster. 

‘‘Stupid and strong,” Barnett 
said. “But no oxygen-breather 
can take much of that.” He grin- 
ned proudly and slapped the 
silver-gray side of the ship. “We’ll 
christen her Endeavor II." 

“Three cheers for the captain!” 
Victor cried enthusiastically. 

“Save your breath,” Barnett 
said. “You’ll need it.” He glanced 
overhead. “We’ve got about four 
hours of light left. Victor, trans- 
fer the food, oxygen and tools 
from Endeavor I and disarm her 
piles. We’ll come back and sal- 
vage the old girl some day. But 
I want to blast off by sundown.” 

Victor hurried off. Barnett and 
Agee entered the ship. 

The rear half of Endeavor II 
was filled with generators, en- 
gines, converters, servos, fuel and 
air tanks. Past that was an enor- 
mous cargo hold, occupying al- 
most another half of the ship. It 
was filled with nuts of all shapes 
and colors, ranging in size from 
two inches in diameter to some 
twice the size of a man’s head. 
That left only two compartments 
in the bow of the ship. 

The first should have been a 
crew room, since it was the only 



available living space. But it was 
completely bare. There were no 
deceleration cots, no tables or 
chairs — nothing but polished 
metal floor. In the walls and ceil- 
ing were several small openings, 
but their purpose was not readily 
apparent. 

Connected to this room was the 
pilot’s compartment. It was very 
small, barely large enough for 
one man, and the panel under the 
observation blister was packed 
solidly with instruments. 

“It’s all yours,” Barnett said. 
“Let’s see what you can do.” 

Agee nodded, looked for a 
chair, then squatted in front of 
the panel. He began to study the 
layout. 

In several hours, Victor had 
transferred all their stores to En- 
deavor II. Agee still had not 
touched anything. He was trying 
to figure out what controlled 
what, from the size, color, shape 
and location of the instruments. 
It wasn’t easy, even accepting 
similar nervous systems and pat- 
terns of thought. Did the auxili- 
ary step-up system run from left 
to right? If not, he would have to 
unlearn his previous flight co- 
ordination. Did red signify dan- 
ger to the designers of this ship? 
If it did, that big switch could be 
for dumping fuel. But red could 
also mean hot fuel, in which case 
the switch might control coarse 
energy flow. 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



For all he knew, its purpose 
was to overload the piles in case 
of enemy attack. 

Agee kept all this in mind as 
he studied the controls. He 
wasn't too worried. For one thing, 
spaceships were tough beasts, 
practically indestructible from 
the inside. For another, he be- 
lieved he had caught onto the 
pattern. 

¥3 ARNETT stuck his head in 
the doorway, with Victor 
close behind him. “You ready?” 

Agee looked over the panel. 
“Guess so.” He touched a dial 
lightly. “This should control the 
airlocks.” 

He turned it. Victor and Bar- 
nett waited, perspiring, in the 
chilly room. 

They heard the smooth flow of 
lubricated metal. The airlocks 
had closed. 

Agee grinned and blew on his 
fingertips for luck. "Here’s the 
air-control system.” He closed a 
switch. 

Out of the ceiling, a yellow 
smoke began to trickle. 

“Impurities in the system,” 
Agee muttered, adjusting a dial. 
Victor began to cough. 

“Turn it off,” Barnet said. 

The smoke poured out in thick 
streams, filling the two rooms 
almost instantly. 

“ Turn it off!” 

“I can’t see it!” Agee thrust at 



the switch, missed and struck a 
button under it. Immediately the 
generators began to whine angri- 
ly. Blue sparks danced along the 
panel and jumped to the wall. 

Agee staggered back from the 
panel and collapsed. Victor was 
already at the door to the cargo 
hold, trying to hammer it down 
with his fists. Barnett covered his 
mouth with one hand and rushed 
to the panel. He fumbled blindly 
for the switch, feeling the ship 
revolve giddily around him. 

Victor fell to the deck, still 
beating feebly at the door. 

Barnett jabbed blindly at the 
panel. 

Instantly the generators stop- 
ped. Then Barnett felt a cold 
breeze on his face. He wiped his 
streaming eyes and looked up. 

A lucky stab had closed the 
ceiling vents, cutting off the yel- 
low gas. He had accidentally 
opened the locks, and the gas in. 
the ship was being replaced by 
the cold night air of the planet. 
Soon the atmosphere was breath- 
able. 

Victor climbed shakily to his 
feet, but Agee didn’t move. Bar- 
nett gave the old pilot artificial 
respiration, cursing softly as he 
did. Agee's eyelids finally flutter- 
ed and his chest began to rise and 
fall. A few minutes later, he sat 
up and shook his head. 

“What was that stuff?” Victor 
asked. 



HANDS OFF 



87 



“I'm afraid,” Barnet said, “that 
our alien friend considered it a 
breathable atmosphere.” 

A GEE shook his head. “Can’t 
be, Captain. He was here on 
an oxygen world, walking around 
with no helmet — ” 

“Air requirements vary tre- 
mendously,” Barnett pointed out. 
“Let’s face it— our friend’s physi- 
cal makeup was quite different 
from ours.” 

“That’s not so good,” Agee 
said. 

The three men looked at each 
other. In the silence that follow- 
ed, they heard a faint, ominous 
sound. 

“What was that?” Victor yelp- 
ed, yanking out his blaster. 

“Shut up!” Barnett shouted. 

They listened. Barnett could 
feel the hairs lift on the back of 
his neck as he tried to identify 
the sound. 

It came from a distance. It 
sounded like metal striking a hard 
non -metallic object. 

The three men looked out the 
port. In the last glow of sunset, 
the could see the main port of 
Endeavor I was open. The sound 
was coming from the ship. 

“It’s impossible,” Agee said. 
“The freeze-blasters — ” 

“Didn’t kill him,” Barnett fin- 
ished. 

“That’s bad,” Agee grunted. 
“That’s very bad.” 



Victor was still holding his 
blaster. “Captain, suppose I 
wander over that way — ” 

Barnett shook his head. “He 
wouldn’t let you within ten feet 
of the lock. No, let me think. Was 
there anything on board he could 
use? The piles?” 

“I’ve got the links, Captain,” 
Victor said. 

“Good. Then there’s nothing 
that — ” 

“The acid,” Agee interrupted. 
“It’s powerful stuff. But I don’t 
suppose he can do much with that 
stuff.” 

“Not a thing,” Barnett said. 
“We’re in this ship and we’re 
staying here. But get it off the 
ground now.” 

Agee looked at the instrument 
panel. Half an hour ago, he had 
almost understood it. Now it was 
a cunningly rigged death trap — a 
booby trap, with invisible wires 
leading to destruction. 

The trap was unintentional. 
But a spaceship was necessarily 
a machine for living as well as 
traveling. The controls would try 
to reproduce the alien’s living 
conditions, supply his needs. 

That might be fatal to them. 

“I wish I knew what kind of 
planet he came from,” Agee said 
unhappily. If they knew the 
alien’s environment, they could 
anticipate what his ship would do. 

All they knew was that he 
breathed a poisonous yellow gas. 



88

“We’re doing all right,” Barnett 
said, without much confidence. 
“Just dope out the drive me- 
chanism and we’ll leave every- 
thing else alone.” 

Agee turned back to the con- 
trols. 

Barnett wished he knew what 
the alien was up to. He stared at 
the bulk of his old ship in the 
twilight and listened to the in- 
comprehensible sound of metal 
striking non-metal. 

T7" ALEN was surprised to find 
that he was still alive. But 
there was a saying among his 
people — “Either a Mabogian is 
killed fast or he isn’t killed at 
all.” It was not at all — so far. 

Groggily, he sat up and leaned 
against a tree. The single red sun 
of the planet was low on the 
horizon and breezes of poisonous 
oxygen swirled around him. He 
tested at once and found that his 
lungs were still securely sealed. 
His life-giving yellow air, al- 
though vitiated from long use, 
was still sustaining him. 

But he couldn’t seem to get 
oriented. A few hundred yards 
away, his ship was resting peace- 
fully. The fading red light glis- 
tened from its hull and, for a 
moment, Kalen was convinced 
that there were no aliens. He had 
imagined the whole thing and 
now he would return to his 
ship . 



He saw one of the aliens, load- 
ed down with goods, enter his 
vessel. In a little while, the air- 
locks closed. 

It was true, all of it. He 
wrenched his mind back to grim 
realities. 

He needed food and air badly. 
His outer skin was dry and crack- 
ed, and in need of nutritional 
cleaning. But food, air and 
cleansers were on his lost ‘ship. 
All he had was a single red kerla 
nut and the thetnite bomb in his 
body pouch. 

If he could open and eat the 
nut, he could regain a little 
strength. But how could he open 
it? 

It was shocking, how complete 
his dependence on machinery had 
been ! Now he would have to find 
some way of doing the most sim- 
ple, ordinary, everyday things — 
the sort of things his ship had 
done automatically, without the 
operator even thinking about 
them. 

Kalen noticed that the aliens 
had apparently abandoned their 
own ship. Why? It didn’t mat- 
ter. Out on the plain, he would 
die before morning. His only 
chance for survival lay inside 
their ship. 

He slid slowly through the 
grass, stopping only when a wave 
of dizziness swept over him. He 
tried to keep watch on his ship. 
If the aliens came after him now,

all would be lost. But nothing 
happened. After an eternity of 
crawling, he reached the ship and 
slipped inside. 

It was twilight. In the dimness, 
he could see that the vessel was 
old. The walls, too thin in the 
first place, had been patched and 
repatched. Everything spoke of 
long, hard use. 

He could understand why they 
wanted his ship. 

Another wave of dizziness 
swept over him. It was his body’s 
way of demanding immediate at- 
tention. 

Food seemed to be the first 
problem. He slipped the kerla 
nut out of his pouch. It was 
round, almost four inches in di- 
ameter, and its hide was two 
inches thick. Nuts of this sort 
were the main ingredient of a 
Mabogian spaceman’s diet. They 
were energy-packed and would 
last almost forever, sealed. 

He propped the nut against a 
wall, found a steel bar and smash- 
ed down on it. The bar, striking 
the nut, emitted a hollow, drum- 
like sound. The nut was undam- 
aged. 

Kalen wondered if the sound 
could be heard by the aliens. He 
would have to chance it. Setting 
himself firmly, he flailed away. 
In fifteen minutes, he was ex- 
hausted and the bar was bent al- 
most in half. 

The nut was undamaged. 



TTE was unable to open the nut 
without a Cracker, a stand- 
ard device on every Mabogian 
ship. No one ever thought of 
opening a nut in any other way. 

It was terrifying evidence of 
his helplessness. 

He lifted the bar for another 
whack and found that his limbs 
were stiffening. He dropped the 
bar and took stock. 

His chilled outer hide was ham- 
pering his motions. The skin was 
hardening slowly into impervious 
horn. Once the hardening was 
completed, he would be immo- 
bilized. Frozen in position, he 
would sit or stand until he died 
of suffocation. 

Kalen fought back a wave of 
despair and tried to think. He 
had to treat his skin without de- 
lay. That was more important 
than food. On board ship, he 
would wash and bathe it, soften 
it and eventually cure it. But it 
was doubtful whether the aliens 
carried the proper cleansers. 

The only other course was to 
rip off his outer hide. The second 
layer would be tender for a few 
days, but at least he would be 
mobile. 

He searched on stiffening 
limbs for a Changer. Then he 
realized that the aliens wouldn’t 
have even this piece of basic ap- 
paratus. He was still on his own. 

He took the steel bar, bent it 
into a hook and inserted the 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



point under a fold of skin. He 
yanked upward with all his 
strength. 

His skin refused to yield. 

Next, he wedged himself be- 
tween a generator and the wall 
and inserted the hook in a dif- 
erent way. But his arms weren’t 
long enough to gain leverage, 
and the tough hide held stub- 
bornly. 

He tried a dozen different po- 
sitions, unsuccessfully. Without 
mechanical assistance, he couldn’t 
hold himself rigidly enough. 

Wearily, he dropped the bar. 
He could do nothing, nothing at 
all. Then he remembered the 
thetnite bomb in his pouch. 

A primitive part of his mind 
which he had not previously 
known existed said that there was 
an easy way out of all this. He 
could slip the bomb under the 
hull of his ship, while the aliens 
weren’t looking, The light charge 
would do no more than throw 
the ship twenty or thirty feet into 
the air, but would not really 
damage it. • 

The aliens, however, would 
undoubtedly be killed. 

Kalen was horrified. How 
could he think such a thing? The 
Mabogian ethic, ingrained in the 
fiber of his being, forbade the 
taking of intelligent life for any 
reason whatsoever. Any reason. 

“But wouldn’t this be justi- 
fied?” that primitive portion of 



his mind whispered. “These 
aliens are diseased. You would be 
doing the Universe a favor by 
getting rid of them and only in- 
cidentally helping yourself. Don’t 
think of it as murder. Consider 
it extermination.” 

He took the bomb out of his 
pouch and looked at it, then 
hastily put it away. “No!” he 
told himself, with less conviction. 

He refused to think any more. 
On tired, almost rigid limbs, he 
began to search the alien ship, 
looking for something that would 
save his life. 

A GEE was crouched in the 
pilot’s compartment, weari- 
ly marking switches with an in- 
delible pencil. His lungs ached 
and he had been working all 
night. Now there was a bleak 
gray dawn outside and a chill 
wind was whipping around En- 
deavor II. The spaceship was 
lighted but cold, for Agee didn’t 
want to touch the temperature 
controls. 

Victor came into the crew 
room, staggering under the 
weight of a heavy packing case. 
“Barnett?” Agee called out. 
“He’s coming,” Victor said. 

The captain wanted all their 
equipment up front, where they 
could get at it quickly. But the 
crew room was small and he had 
used most of the available space. 
Looking around for a spot to 



HANDS OFF

put the case, Victor noticed a 
door in one wall. He pressed its 
stud and the door slid smartly in- 
to the ceiling, revealing a room 
the size of a closet. Victor de- 
cided it would make an ideal 
storage space. 

Ignoring the crushed red shells 
on the floor, he slid the case in- 
side. 

Immediately, the ceiling of the 
little room began to descend. 

Victor let out a yell that could 
be heard throughout the ship. He 
leaped up— and slammed his 
head against the ceiling. He fell 
on his face, stunned. 

Agee rushed out of the pilot’s 
compartment and Barnett sprint- 
ed into the room. Barnett grab- 
bed Victor’s legs and tried to 
drag him out, but Victor was 
Heavy and the captain was un- 
able to get a purchase on the 
smooth metal floor. 

With rare presence of mind, 
Agee up-ended the packing case. 
The ceiling was momentarily 
stopped by it. 

Together, Barnett and Agee 
tugged at Victor’s legs. They 
managed to drag him out just in 
time. The heavy case splintered 
and, in another moment, was 
crushed like a piece of balsa 
wood. 

The ceiling of the little room, 
descending on a greased shaft, 
compressed the packing case to 
a six-inch thickness. Then its 



gears clicked and it slid back 
into place without a sound. 

V ICTOR sat up and rubbed 
his head. “Captain,” he said 
plaintively, “can’t we get our 
own ship back?” 

Agee was doubtful of the ven- 
ture, too. He looked at the deadly 
little room, which again resem- 
bled a closet with crushed red 
shells on the floor. 

“Sure seems like a jinx ship,” 
he said worriedly. “Maybe Vic- 
tor’s right.” 

“You want to give her up?” 
Barnett asked. 

Agee squirmed uncomfortably 
and nodded. “Trouble is,” he 
said, not looking at Barnett, “we 
don’t know what she’ll do next. 
It’s just too risky, Captain.” 

“Do you realize what you’d 
be giving up?” Barnett chal- 
lenged. “Her hull alone is worth 
a fortune. Have you looked at 
her engines? There’s nothing this 
side of Earth that could stop her. 
She could drill her way through 
a planet and come out the other 
side with all her paint on. And 
you want to give her up!” 

“She won’t be worth much if 
she kills us,” Agee objected. 

Victor nodded emphatically. 
Barnett stared at them. 

“Now listen to me carefully,” 
Barnett said. “We are not going 
to give up this ship. She is not 
jinxed. She’s alien and filled with 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



alien apparatus. All we have to 
do is keep our hands off things 
until we reach drydock. Under- 
stand?" 

Agee wanted to say something 
about closets that turned into 
hydraulic presses. It didn’t seem 
to him a promising sign for the 
future. But, looking at Barnett’s 
face, he decided against it. 

“Have you marked all the op- 
erating controls?” Barnett asked. 

“Just a few more to go,” Agee 
said. 

“Right. Finish up and those 
are the only ones we’ll touch. If 
we leave the rest of the ship 
alone, she’ll leave us alone. 
There’s no danger if we just keep 
hands off.” 

Barnett wiped perspiration 
from his face, leaned against a 
wall and unbuttoned his coat. 

Immediately, two metal bands 
slid out of openings on either 
side of him and circled his waist 
and stomach. 

Barnett stared at them for a 
moment, then threw himself for- 
ward with all his strength. The 
bands didn’t give. There was a 
peculiar clicking sound in the 
walls and a slender wire filament 
slid out. It touched Barnett’s coat 
appraisingly, then retreated into 
the wall. 

Agee and Victor stared help- 
lessly. 

“Turn it off,” Barnett said 
tensely. 



Agee rushed into the control 
room. Victor continued staring. 
Out of the wall slid a metal limb, 
tipped with a glittering three- 
inch blade. 

“ Stop it!” Barnett screamed. 
Victor unfroze. He ran up and 
tried to wrench the metal limb 
out of the wall. It twisted once 
and sent him reeling across the 
room. 

W ITH the precision of a sur- 
geon, the knife slit Bar- 
nett’s coat down the middle, not 
touching the shirt underneath. 
Then the limb slid out of sight. 

Agee was punching controls 
now and the generators whined, 
the locks opened and closed, 
stabilizers twitched, lights flick- 
ered. The mechanism that held 
Barnett was unaffected. 

The slender filament returned. 
It touched Barnett’s shirt and 
paused an instant. The internal 
mechanism chittered alarmingly. 
The filament touched Barnett’s 
shirt again, as if unsure of its 
function in his case. 

Agee shouted from the control 
room, “I can’t turn it off! It must 
be fully automatic!” 

The filament slid into the wall. 
It disappeared and the knife- 
tipped limb slid out. 

By this time, Victor had lo- 
cated a heavy wrench. He rushed 
over, swung it above his head 
and smashed it against the limb, 



HANDS OFF 



93 



narrowly missing Barnett’s head. 

The limb was not even dented. 
Serenely, it cut Barnett’s shirt 
from his back, leaving him naked 
to the waist. 

Barnett was not hurt, but his 
eyes rolled wildly as the filament 
came out. Victor put his fist in 
his mouth and backed away. 
Agee shut his eyes. 

The filament touched Barnett’s 
warm living flesh, clucked ap- 
provingly and slid back into the 
wall. The bands opened. Barnett 
tumbled to his knees. 

For a while, no one spoke. 
There was nothing to say. Bar- 
nett stared moodily into space. 
Victor started to crack his knuck- 
les over and over again, until 
Agee nudged him. 

The old pilot was trying to fig- 
ure out why the mechanism had 
slit Barnett’s clothing and then 
stopped when it reached living 
flesh. Was this the way the alien 
undressed himself? It didn’t make 
sense. But then, the press-closet 
didn’t make sense, either. 

In a way, he was glad it had 
happened. It must have taught 
Barnett something. Now they 
would leave this jinxed monstros- 
ity and figure out a way of re- 
gaining their own ship. 

“Get me a shirt,’’ Barnett said. 
Victor hurriedly found one for 
him. Barnett slipped it on, stay- 
ing clear of the walls. “How soon 
can you get this ship moving?” 




94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







he asked Agee, a bit unsteadily. 

“What?” 

“You heard me.” 

“Haven’t you had enough?” 
Agee gasped. 

“No. How soon can we blast 
out?” 

“About another hour,” Agee 
grumbled. What else could he 
say? The captain was just too 
much. Wearily, Agee returned to 
the control room. 

Barnett put a sweater over 
the shirt and a coat over that. It 
was chilly in the room and he 
had begun to shiver violently. 

K ALEN lay motionless on the 
deck of the alien ship. Fool- 
ishly, he had wasted most of his 
remaining strength in trying to 
rip off his stiff outer hide. But 
the hide grew progressively tough- 
er as he grew weaker. Now it 
seemed hardly worthwhile to 
move. Better to rest and feel his 
internal fires bum. lower . 

Soon he was dreaming of the 
ridged hills of Mabog and the 
great port of Canthanope, where 
the interstellar traders swung 
down with their strange cargoes. 
He was there in twilight, looking 
over the flat roofs at the two 
great setting suns. But why were 
they setting together in the south, 
the blue sun and the yellow? How 
could they set together in the 
south? A physical impossibility. 
. Perhaps his father could ex-

plain it, for it was rapidly grow- 
ing dark. 

He shook himself out of the 
fantasy and stared at the grim 
light of morning. This was not 
the way for a Mabogian space- 
man to die. He would try again. 

After half an hour of slow, 
painful searching, he found a 
sealed metal box in the rear of 
the ship. The aliens had evident- 
ly overlooked it. He wrenched 
off the top. Inside were several 
bottles, carefully fastened and 
padded against shock. Kalen 
lifted one and examined it. 

It was marked with a large 
white symbol. There was no rea- 
son why he should know the 
symbol, but it seemed faintly 
familiar. He searched his mem- 
ory, trying to recall where he 
had seen it. 

Then, hazily, he remembered. 
It was a representation of a hu- 
manoid skull. There was one 
humanoid race in the Mabogian 
Union and he had seen replicas 
of their skulls in a museum. 

But why would anyone put 
such a thing on a bottle? 

To Kalen, a skull conveyed an 
emotion of reverence. This must 
be what the manufacturers had 
intended. He opened the bottle 
and sniffed. 

The odor was interesting. It 
reminded him of — 

Skin-cleansing solution! 

Without further delay, he pour- 



ed the entire bottle over himself. 
Hardly daring to hope, he wait- 
ed. If he could put his skin back 
into working order . 

Yes, the liquid in the skull- 
marked bottle was a mild cleans- 
er! It was pleasantly scented, too. 

He poured another bottle over 
his armored hide and felt the 
nutritious fluid seep in. His body, 
starved for nourishment, called 
eagerly for more. He drained an- 
other bottle. 

TT'OR a long time, Kalen just lay 
-*• back and let the life-giving 
fluid soak in. His skin loosened 
and became pliable. He could feel 
a new surge of energy within 
him, a new will to live. 

He would live! 

After the bath, Kalen exam- 
ined the spaceship’s controls, 
hoping to pilot the old crate back 
to Mabog. There were immedi- 
ate difficulties. For some reason, 
the piloting controls weren’t seal- 
ed into a separate room. He won- 
dered why not? Those strange 
creatures couldn’t have turned 
their whole ship into a decelera- 
tion chamber. They couldn’t! 
There wasn’t enough tank space 
to hold the fluid. 

It was perplexing, but every- 
thing about the aliens was per- 
plexing. He could overcome that 
difficulty. But when Kalen in- 
spected the engines, he saw that 
a vital link had been removed 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from the piles. They were use- 
less. 

That left only one alternative. 
He had to win back his own ship. 

But how? 

He paced the deck restlessly. 
The Mabogian ethic forbade kill- 
ing intelligent life, and there 
were no ifs or buts about it. 
Under no circumstances — not 
even to save your own life — were 
you allowed to kill. It was a wise 
rule and had served Mabog well. 
By strict adherence to it, the 
Mabogians had avoided war for 
three thousand years and had 
trained their people to a high de- 
gree of civilization. Which would 
have been impossible had they 
allowed exceptions to creep in. 
Ifs and buts could erode the 
soundest of principles. 

He could not be a backslider. 

But was he going to die here 
passively? 

Looking down, Kalen was sur- 
prised to see that a puddle of 
cleaning solution had eaten a hole 
in the deck. How flimsily these 
ships were made — even a mild 
cleaning solution could damage 
one! The aliens themselves must 
be very weak. 

One thetnite bomb could do it. 

He walked to the port. No one 
seemed to be on guard. He sup- 
posed they were too busy pre- 
paring for takeoff. It would be 
easy to slide through the grass, 
up to his ship . 



And no one on Mabog would 
ever have to know about it. 

Kalen found, to his surprise, 
that he had covered almost half 
the distance between ships with- 
out realizing it. Strange, how his 
body could do things without his 
mind being aware of it. 

He took out the bomb and 
crawled another twenty feet. 

Because after all — taking the 
long view — what difference would 
this killing make? 

“ A REN’T you ready yet?” 
Barnett asked, at noon. 

‘‘I guess so,” Agee said. He 
looked over the marked panel. 
“As ready as I’ll ever be.” 

Barnett nodded. “Victor and I 
will strap down in the crew 
room. Take off under minimum 
acceleration.” 

Barnett returned to the crew 
room. Agee fastened the straps 
he had rigged and rubbed his 
hands together nervously. As far 
as he knew, all the essential con- 
trols were marked. Everything 
should go all right. He hoped. 

For there were that closet and 
the knife. It was anyone’s guess 
what this insane ship would do 
next. 

“Ready out here,” Barnett 
called from the crew room. 

“All right. About ten seconds.” 
He closed and sealed the air- 
locks. His door closed automati- 
cally, cutting him off from the 



HANDS OFF 



97 



crew room. Feeling a slight touch 
of claustrophobia, Agee activated 
the piles. Everything was fine so 
far. 

There was a thin slick of oil 
on the deck. Agee decided it was 
from a loose joint and ignored it. 
The control surfaces worked 
beautifully. He punched a course 
into the ship’s tape and activated 
the flight controls. 

Then he felt something lapping 
against his foot. Looking down, 
he was amazed to see that thick, 
evil-smelling oil was almost three 
inches deep on the deck. It was 
quite a leak. He couldn’t under- 
stand how a ship as well built as 
this could have such a flaw. Un- 
strapping himself, he groped for 
the source. 

He found it. There were four 
small vents in the deck and each 
of them was feeding a smooth, 
even flow of oil. 

Agee punched the stud that 
opened his door and found that it 
remained sealed. Refusing to 
grow panicky, he examined the 
door with care. 

It should open. 

It didn’t. 

The oil was almost up to his 
knees. 

He grinned foolishly. Stupid of 
him! The pilot room was sealed 
from the control board. He press- 
ed the release and went back to 
the door. 

It still refused to open. 



Agee tugged at it with all his 
strength, but it wouldn’t budge. 
He waded back to the control 
panel. There had been no oil 
when they found the ship. That 
meant there had to be a drain 
somewhere. 

^T^HE oil was waist-deep before 
he found it. Quickly the oil 
disappeared. Once it was gone, 
the door opened easily. 

“What’s the matter?” Barnett 
asked. 

Agee told him. 

“So that’s how he does it,” 
Barnett said quietly. “Glad I 
found out.” 

“Does what?” Agee asked, feel- 
ing that Barnett was taking the 
whole thing too lightly. 

“How he stands the accelera- 
tion of takeoff. It bothered me. 
He hadn’t anything on board 
that resembled a bed or cot. No 
chairs, nothing to strap into. So 
he floats in the oil bath, which 
turns on automatically when the 
ship is prepared for flight.” 

“But why wouldn’t the door 
open?” Agee asked. 

“Isn’t it obvious?” Barnett 
said, smiling patiently. “He 
wouldn’t want oil all over the 
ship. And he wouldn’t want it to 
drain out accidentally.” 

“We can’t take off," Agee in- 
sisted. 

“Why not?” 

“Because I can’t breathe very 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



well under oil. It turns on auto- 
matically with the power and 
there’s no way of turning it off.” 
“Use your head,” Barnett told 
him. “Just tie down the drain 
switch. The oil will be carried 
away as fast as it comes in.” 
“Yeah, I hadn’t thought of 
that,” Agee admitted unhappily. 
“Go ahead, then.” 

“I want to change my clothes 
first.” 

“No. Get this damned ship off 
the ground.” 

“But, Captain — ” 

“Get her moving,” Barnett or- 
dered. “For all we know, that 
alien is planning something.” 
Agee shrugged his shoulders, 
returned to the pilot room and 
strapped in. 

“Ready?” 

“Yes, get her moving.” 

He tied down the drain circuit 
and the oil flowed safely in and 
out, not rising higher than the 
tops of his shoes. He activated 
all the controls without further 
incident. 

“Here goes.” He set minimum 
acceleration and blew on his 
fingertips for luck. 

Then he punched the blast- 
switch. 

W ITH profound regret, Kalen 
watched his ship depart. 
He was still holding the thetnite 
bomb in his hand. 

He had reached his ship, had 



even stood under her for a few 
seconds. Then he had crept back 
to the alien vessel. He had been 
unable to set the bomb. Centu- 
ries of conditioning were too 
much to overcome in a few hours. 

Conditioning — and something 
more. 

Few individuals of any race 
murder for pleasure. There are 
perfectly -adequate reasons to kill, 
though, reasons which might sat- 
isfy any philosopher. 

But, once accepted, there are 
more reasons, and more and 
more. And murder, once accept- 
ed, is hard to stop. It leads ir- 
resistibly to war and, from there, 
to annihilation. 

Kalen felt that this murder 
somehow involved the destiny of 
his race. His abstinence had been 
almost a matter of race-survival. 

But it didn’t make him feel any 
better. 

He watched his ship dwindle 
to a dot in the sky. The aliens 
were leaving at a ridiculously 
slow speed. He could think of no 
reason for this, unless they were 
doing it for his benefit. 

Undoubtedly they were sadis- 
tic enough for that. 

Kalen returned to the ship. His 
will to live was as strong as ever. 
He had no intention of giving up. 
He would hang onto life as long 
as he could, hoping for the one 
chance in a million that would 
bring another ship to this planet.

Looking around, he thought 
that he might concoct an air- 
substitute out of the skull-mark- 
ed cleanser. It would sustain him 
for a day or two. Then, if he 
could open the kerla nut . 

He thought he heard a noise 
outside and rushed to look. The 
sky was empty. His ship had van- 
ished, and he was alone. 

He returned to the alien ship 
and set about the serious business 
of staying alive. 

A S Agee recovered conscious- 
ness, he found that he had 
managed to cut the acceleration 
in half, just before passing out. 
This was the only thing that had 
saved his life. 

And the acceleration, hovering 
just above zero on the dial, was 
still unbearably heavy! Agee un- 
sealed the door and crawled out. 

Barnett and Victor had burst 
their straps on the takeoff. Victor 
was just returning to conscious- 
ness. Barnett picked himself out 
of a pile of smashed cases. 

“Do you thihk you’re flying in 
a circus?” he complained. “I told 
you minimum acceleration.” 

“I started under minimum ac- 
celeration,” Agee said. “Go read 
the tape for yourself.” 

Barnett marched to the control 
room. He came out quickly. 

"That’s bad. Our alien friend 
operates this ship at three times 
our acceleration." 



“That’s the way it looks.” 

“I hadn’t thought of that,” 
Barnett said thoughtfully. “He 
must come from a heavy planet 
— a place where you have to 
blast out at high speed, if you 
expect to get out at all.” 

“What hit me?” Victor groan- 
ed, rubbing his head. 

There was a clicking in the 
walls. The ship was fully awake 
now, and its servos turned on 
automatically. 

“Getting warm, isn’t it?” Vic- 
tor asked. 

“Yeah, and thick,” Agee said. 
“Pressure buildup.” He went 
back to the control room. Barnett 
and Victor stood anxiously in 
the doorway, waiting. 

“I can’t turn it off,” Agee said, 
wiping perspiration from his 
streaming face. “The temperature 
and pressure are automatic. They 
must go to ‘normal’ as soon as 
the ship is in flight.” 

“You damn well better turn 
them off,” Barnett told him. 
“We’ll fry in here if you don’t.” 
“There’s no way.” 

“He must have some kind of 
heat regulation.” 

“Sure — there!” Agee said, 
pointing. “The control is already 
set at its lowest point.” 

“1V/HAT do you suppose his 
** normal, temperature is?" 
Barnett asked. 

“I’d hate to find out,” Agee

said. “This ship is built of ex- 
tremely high melting-point alloys. 
It’s constructed to withstand ten 
times the pressure of an Earth 
ship. Put those together . .” 

“You must be able to turn it 
off somewhere!” Barnett said. He 
peeled off his jacket and sweater. 
The heat was mounting rapidly 
and the deck was becoming too 
hot to stand on. 

“Turn it off!" Victor howled. 

“Wait a minute,” Agee said. “J 
didn’t build this ship, you know. 
How should I know — ” 

“Off/” Victor screamed, shak- 
ing Agee up and down like a rag 
doll. “Off/” 

“Let go!” Agee half-drew his 
blaster. Then, in a burst of in- 
spiration, he turned off the ship’s 
engines. 

The clicking in the walls stop- 
ped. The room began to cool. 

“What happened?” Victor ask- 
ed. 

“The temperature and pressure 
fall when the power is off,” Agee 
said. “We’re safe — as long as we 
don’t run the engines.” 

“How long will it take us to 
coast to a port?” Barnett asked. 

Agee figured it out. “About 
three years,” he said. “We’re 
pretty far out.” 

“Isn’t there any way we can 
rip out those servos? Disconnect 
them?” 

“They’re built into the guts of 
the ship,” Agee said. “We’d need 



a full machine shop and skilled 
help. Even then, it wouldn’t be 
easy.” 

Barnett was silent for a long 
time. Finally he said, “All right." 

“All right what?” 

“We’re licked. We’ve got to go 
back to that planet and take our 
own ship.” 

A GEE heaved a sigh of relief 
and punched a new course 
on the ship’s tape. 

“You think the alien’ll give it 
back?” Victor asked. 

“Sure he will,” Barnett said, 
“if he’s not dead. He’ll be pretty 
anxious to get his own ship back. 
And he has to leave our ship to 
get in his." 

“Sure. But once he gets back 
in this ship . .” 

“We’ll gimmick the controls,” 
Barnett said. “That’ll slow him 
down.” 

"For a little while,” Agee point- 
ed out. “But he’ll get into the air 
sooner or later, with blood in his 
eye. We’ll never outrun him.” 

“We won’t have to,” Barnett 
said. “All we have to do is get 
into the air first. He’s got a strong 
hull, but I don’t think it’ll take 
three atomic bombs.” 

“I hadn’t thought of that,” 
Agee said, smiling faintly. 

“Only logical move,” Barnett 
said complacently. “The alloys 
in the hull will still be worth 
something. Now, get us back 



102

without frying us, if you can.” 

Agee turned the engines on. He 
swung the ship around in a tight 
curve, piling on all the Gs they 
could stand. The servos clicked 
on, and the temperature shot 
rapidly up. Once the curve was 
rounded, Agee pointed Endeavor 
II in the right direction and shut 
off the engines. 

They coasted most of the way. 
But when they reached the plan- 
et, Agee had to leave the engines 
on, to bring them around the de- 
celeration spiral and into the 
landing. 

They were barely able to get 
out of the ship. Their skins were 
blistered and their shoes burned 
through. There was no time to 
gimmick the controls. 

They retreated to the woods 
and waited. 

“Perhaps he’s dead,” Agee said 
hopefully. 

They saw a small figure emerge 
from Endeavor I. The alien was 
moving slowly, but he was mov- 
ing. 

They watched. “Suppose,” Vic- 
tor said, “he’s made a weapon of 
some kind. Suppose he comes 
after us.” 

“Suppose you shut up,” Bar- 
nett said. 

The alien walked directly to 
his own ship. He went inside and 
shut the locks. 

“All right,” Barnett said, stand- 
ing up. “We’d better blast off in 



a hurry. Agee, you take the con- 
trols. I’ll connect the piles. Vic- 
tor, you secure the locks. Let’s 
go!” 

They sprinted across the plain 
and, in a matter of seconds, had 
reached the open airlock of En- 
deavor I. 

TTWEN if he had wanted to hur- 
ry, Kalen didn’t have the 
necessary strength to pilot his 
ship. But he knew that he was 
safe, once inside. No alien was 
going to walk through those seal- 
ed ports. 

He found a spare air tank in 
the rear and opened it. His ship 
filled with rich, life-giving yellow 
air. For long minutes, Kalen just 
breathed it. 

Then he lugged three of the 
biggest kerla nuts he could find 
to the galley and let the Cracker 
open them. 

After eating, he felt much bet- 
ter. He let the Changer take off 
his outer hide. The second layer 
was dead, too, and the Changer 
cut that off him, but stopped at 
the third, living layer. 

He was almost as good as new 
when he slipped into the pilot’s 
room. 

It was apparent to him now 
that the aliens had been tempo- 
rarily insane. There was no other 
way to explain why they had 
come back and returned his ship. 

Therefore, he would find their 



HANDS OFF 



103 



authorities and report the loca- 
tion of the planet. They could be 
found and cured, once and for all. 

Kalen felt very happy. He had 
not deviated from the Mabogian 
ethic, and that was the important 
thing. He could so easily have 
left the thetnite bomb in their 
ship, all set and timed. He could 
have wrecked their engines. And 
there had been a temptation. 

But he had not. He had done 
nothing at all. 

All he had done was construct 
a few minimum essentials for the 
preservation of his life. 

Kalen activated his controls 
and found that everything was 
in perfect working order. The ac- 
celeration fluid poured in as he 
turned on the piles. 

V ICTOR reached the airlock 
first and dashed in. Instantly, 
he was hurled back. 

“What happened?” Barnett 
asked. 

“Something hit me,” Victor 
said. 

Cautiously, they looked inside. 
It was a very neat death trap. 
Wires from the storage batteries 
had been hooked in series and 
rigged across the port. If Victor 
had been touching the side of the 
ship, he would have been electro- 
cuted instantly. 

They shorted out the system 
and entered the ship. 

It was a mess. Everything mov- 



able had been ripped up and 
strewn around. There was a bent 
steel bar in a corner. Their high- 
potency acid had been spilled 
over the deck and had eaten 
through in several places. The 
Endeavor's old hull was holed. 

“I never thought he’d gimmick 
us/” Agee said. 

They explored further. Toward 
the rear was another booby trap. 
The cargo hold door had been 
cunningly rigged to the small 
starter motor. If anyone touched 
it, the door would be slammed 
against the wall. A man caught 
between would be crushed. 

There were other hookups that 
gave no hint of their purpose. 

“Can we fix it?” Barnett asked. 

Agee shrugged his shoulders. 
“Most of our tools are still on 
board Endeavor II. I suppose we 
can get her patched up inside of 
a year. But even then, I don’t 
know if the hull will hold.” 

They walked outside. The alien 
ship blasted off. 

“What a monster!” Barnett 
said, looking at the acid-eaten 
hull of his ship. 

“You can never tell what an 
alien will do,” Agee answered. 

“The only good alien is a dead 
alien,” Victor said. 

Endeavor I was now as incom- 
prehensible and dangerous as En- 
deavor II. 

And Endeavor II was gone.

have learned, but for whom they 
have known, and this old man 
had known Wainer. 

Therefore he spoke and told 
Them what he knew, and more 
that he did not know he was 
telling. And They, who were not 
men, sat in silence and the deep- 
est affection, and listened . 

WV7ILLIAM Wainer died and 
™ was forgotten (said the old 
man) much more than a thou- 
sand years ago. I have heard it 
said that people are like waves, 
rising and riding and crumbling, 
and if a wave fell once on a shore 
long ago, then it left its mark on 
on the beach and changed the 
shape of the world, but is not re- 
membered. That is true, except 
for the bigger waves. There is 
nothing remarkable in Wainer’s 
being forgotten then, because he 
was not a big wave. In his own 
time, he was nothing at all — he 
even lived off the state — and the 
magnificent power that was in 
him and that he brought to the 
world was never fully recognized. 
But the story of his life is prob- 
ably the greatest story I have ever 
heard. He was the beginning of 
You. I only wish I had known. 

From his earliest days, as I re- 
member, no one ever looked after 
Wainer. His father had been one 
of the last of the priests. Just be- 
fore young Wainer was born in 
2430, the government passed one 



of the great laws, the we-take-no- 
barriers-into-space edict, and re- 
ligious missionaries were banned 
from the stars. Wainer’s father 
never quite recovered from that. 
He went down to the end of his 
days believing that the Earth had 
gone over to what he called “An- 
ti-Christ.” He was a fretful man 
and he had no time for the boy. 

Young Wainer grew up alone. 
Like everyone else, he was op- 
erated on at the age of five, and 
it turned out that he was a Re- 
ject. At the time, no one cared. 
His mother afterward said that 
she was glad, because Wainer’s 
head even then was magnificent- 
ly shaped and it would have been 
a shame to put a lump on it. Of 
course, Wainer knew that he 
could never be a doctor, or a 
pilot, or a technician of any kind, 
but he was only five years old 
and nothing was final to him. 
Some of the wonderful optimism 
he was to carry throughout his 
youth, and which he was to need 
so badly in later years, was al- 
ready with him as a boy. 

And yet You must understand 
that the world in which Wainer 
grew up was a good world, a fine 
world. Up to that time, it was the 
best world that ever was, and no 
one doubted that — 

(Some of Them had smiled in 
Their minds. The old man was 
embarrassed.) 

You must try to understand. 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




WAINER 



107 



We all believed in that world; 
Wainer and I and everyone be- 
lieved. But I will explain as best 
I can and doubtless You will un- 
derstand. 

When it was learned, long be- 
fore Wainer was born, that the 
electronic brains could be inserted 
within the human brain and con- 
nected with the main neural 
paths, there was no one who did 
not think it was the greatest dis- 
covery of all time. Do You know, 
can You have any idea, what the 
mind of Man must have been like 
before the brains? God help them, 
they lived all their lives without 
controlling themselves, trapped, 
showered by an unceasing bar- 
rage of words, dreams, totally un- 
related, uncontrollable memories. 
It must have been horrible. 

rpHE brains changed all that. 

They gave Man freedom to 
think, freedom from confusion: 
they made him logical. There 
was no longer any need to mem- 
orize, because the brains could 
absorb any amount of infor- 
mation that was inserted into 
them, either before or after the 
operation. And the brains never 
forgot, and seldom made mis- 
takes, and computed all things 
with an inhuman precision. 

A man with a brain — or 
"clerks,” as they were called, af- 
ter Le Clerq — knew everything, 
literally everything, that there 



was to know about his profession. 
And as new information was 
learned, it was made available to 
all men, and punched into the 
clerks of those who desired it. 
Man began to think more clearly 
than ever before, and thought 
with more knowledge behind him, 
and it seemed for a while that 
this was a godlike thing. 

But in the beginning, of course, 
it was very hard on the Rejects. 

Once in every thousand per- 
sons or so would come someone 
like Wainer whose brain would 
not accept the clerk, who would 
react as if the clerk were no more 
than a hat. After a hundred years, 
our scientists still did not know 
why. Many fine minds were ruin- 
ed with their memory sections 
cut away, but then a preliminary 
test was devised to prove before- 
hand that the clerks would not 
work and that there was nothing 
that anyone could do to make 
them work. Year by year the Re- 
jects, as they were called, kept 
coming, until they were a sizable 
number. The more fortunate men 
with clerks outnumbered the Re- 
jects a thousand to one, and ruled 
the society, and were called 
"Rashes” — slang for Rationals. 

Thus the era of the Rash and 
Reject. 

Now, of course, in those days 
the Rejects could not hope to 
compete in a technical world. 
They could neither remember nor 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 






compute well enough, and the 
least of all doctors knew more 
than a Reject ever could, the 
worst of all chemists knew much 
more chemistry, and a Reject 
certainly could never be a space 
pilot. 

As a result of all this, mne- 
monics was studied as never be- 
fore; and Rejects were taught 
memory. When Wainer was fully 
grown, his mind was more or- 
dered and controlled and his 
memory more exact than any 
man who had lived on Earth a 
hundred years before. But he was 
still a Reject and there was not 
much for him to do. 

He began to feel it, I think, 
when he was about fifteen. He 
had always wanted to go into 
space, and when he realized at 
last that it was impossible, that 
even the meanest of jobs aboard 
ship was beyond him, he was very 
deeply depressed. He told me 
about those days much later, 
when it was only a Reject’s mem- 
ory of his youth. I have lived a 
thousand years since then, and I 
have never stopped regretting 
that they did not let him go just 
once when he was young, before 
those last few days. It would 
have been such a little thing for 
them to do. 

T FIRST met Wainer when he 
was eighteen years old and 
had not yet begun to work. We 



met in one of those music clubs 
that used to be in New York City, 
one of the weird, smoky, crowded 
little halls where Rejects could 
gather and breathe their own air 
away from the — as we called 
them — “lumpheads." I remember 
young Wainer very clearly. He 
was a tremendous man, larger 
even than You, with huge arms 
and eyes, and that famous mass 
of brownish hair. His size set him 
off from the rest of us, but it 
never bothered him, and although 
he was almost painfully awk- 
ward, he was never laughed at. 

I don’t quite know how to de- 
scribe it, but he was very big — 
ominous, almost — and he gave off 
an aura of tremendous strength. 
He said very little, as I remem- 
ber; he sat with us silently and 
drank quite a bit, and listened to 
the music and to us, grinning 
from time to time with a won- 
derfully pleasant smile. He was 
very likable. 

He was drawn to me, I think, 
because I was : a successful Re- 
ject — I was just then becoming 
known as a surgeon. I sincerely 
believed that he envied me. 

At any rate, he was always 
ready to talk to me. In the early 
days I did what I could to get 
him working, but he never really 
tried. He had only the Arts, You 
see, and they never really ap- 
pealed to him. 

(There was a rustle of surprise 



WAINER 



109 



among Them. The old man nod- 
ded.) 

It is true. He never wanted to 
be an artist. He had too much 
need for action in him, and he 
did not want to be a lonely man. 
But because of the Rashes, he 
had no choice. 

The Rashes, as You know, had 
very little talent. I don’t know 
why. Perhaps it was the pre- 
cision, the methodicity with 
which they lived, or perhaps — 
as we proudly claimed — the Re- 
jects were Rejects because they 
had talent. But the result was 
wonderfully just: the Rejects 

took over the Arts and all other 
fields requiring talent. I myself 
had good hands; I became a sur- 
geon. Although I never once op- 
erated without a Rash by my 
side, I was a notably successful 
surgeon. 

It was a truly splendid thing. 
That is why I say it was a good 
world. The Rash and Reject com- 
bined in society and made it 
whole. And one thing more was 
in favor of the Reject: he was 
less precise, less logical, and 
therefore more glamorous than 
the Rash. Hence Rejects always 
had plenty of women, and Re- 
ject women did well with. men. 

But the Rash, in the end, had 
everything that really counted. 

Well, there was only such work 
that a Reject could do. But none 
of it fitted Wainer. He tried all 



the arts at one time or another 
before he finally settled on music. 
In music there was something 
vast and elemental; he saw that 
he could build. He began, and 
learned, but did little actual 
work. In those beginning years, 
he could be found almost always 
out by the Sound, or wandering 
among the cliffs across the River, 
his huge hands fisted and groping 
for something to do, wondering, 
wondering, why he was a Reject. 

FI'lHE first thing he wrote was 
the Pavanne, which came af- 
ter his first real love affair. I 
cannot remember the girl, but in 
a thousand years I have not for- 
gotten the music. It may surprise 
You to learn that the Pavanne 
was a commercial success. It sur- 
prised Wainer, too. The Rashes 
were actually the public, and 
their taste was logical. Most of 
all they liked Bach and Mozart, 
some Beethoven and Greene, but 
nothing emotional and obscure. 
The Pavanne was a success be- 
cause it was a love piece, won- 
derfully warm and gay and open. 
Wainer never repeated that suc- 
cess. 

That was one of the few times 
I ever saw him with money. He 
received the regular government 
fee and a nice sum in .royalties, 
but not quite enough for a trip 
into space, so he drank it all up. 
He was happy for a while. He 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



went back to the music clubs and 
stayed away from the beaches, 
but when I asked him if he was 
working on anything else, he said 
no, he had nothing else to write. 

Right after that, he fell in love 
again, this time with his mother. 

The longevity treatment was 
still fairly new; few had stopped 
to consider that, as men grew 
older, their mothers remained 
young, as tender and fresh as 
girls in school, and there is no 
i woman as close to a man as his 
mother. Inevitably, a great many 
men fell in love that way. Wainer 
was one. His mother, poor girl, 
never suspected, and it was pure 
anguish for him. It was some time 
before he had recovered enough 
to talk about it, and by then he 
was thirty. One of the ways he 
recovered was by writing more 
music. 

There were a lot of lesser 
works, and then came the First 
Symphony. 

Looking back over the cen- 
turies, I cannot understand how 
the thing was so controversial. 
The Rashes wrote of it harshly 
in all their papers. The Rejects 
almost unanimously agreed that 
it was a masterpiece. I myself, 
when I heard it, became aware 
that Wainer was a great man. 

"OECAUSE of the controversy 
which raged for a while, 
Wainer made some money, but 



the effect of the criticism was to 
keep him from writing for years. 
There is something in that First 
Symphony of the Wainer of later 
years, some of the hungry, 
unfinished, incomprehensible 
strength. Wainer knew that if he 
wrote anything else, it would be 
much like the First, and he re- 
coiled from going through it all 
again. He went back to the 
beaches. 

He had something rare in those 
days — a great love for the sea. I 
suppose it was to him what space 
is to others. I know that the next 
thing he wrote was a wild, churn- 
ing, immortal thing which he 
called Water Music; and I know 
that he himself loved it best of 
anything he wrote, except, of 
course, the Tenth Symphony. But 
this time was worse than the last. 
The only ones who paid any at- 
tention to Water Music were the 
Rejects, and they didn’t count. 

If Wainer had been a true com- 
poser, he would have gone on 
composing whether anyone cared 
or not, but as I have said, he was 
not really an artist. Despite the 
fact that he was the greatest com- 
poser we have ever known, music 
was only a small thing to him. He 
had a hint, even then, that al- 
though he had been born on 
Earth there was something in him 
that was alien, and that there was 
so much left to do, so much to be 
seen, and because he could not 



WAINER 



111 



understand what it was that fired 
him, he ground himself raw, 
slowly, from within, while walk- 
ing alone by the rocks on the 
beaches. 

When I saw him again, after 
I took ship as a surgeon to Altair, 
he was forty, and he looked — I 
borrow the phrase — like a man 
from a land where nobody lived. 
Having written no music at all, 
he was living again on govern- 
ment charity. He had a room, of 
sorts, and food, but whatever 
money he got he drank right up, 
and he was such a huge and hag- 
gard man that even Rejects left 
him carefully alone. I did what I 
could for him, which wasn’t much 
except' keep him drunk. It was 
then that he told me about his 
feeling for space, and a great 
many other things, and I remem- 
ber his words: 

“I will have to go out into 
space some day. It is almost as if 
I used to live there.” 

Shortly after that, the coughing 
began. But it came very seldom 
and seemed no more than a com- 
mon thing. Because there was no 
longer any such thing as disease, 
neither Wainer nor I thought 
much about it, except that Wainer 
went and got some pills from the 
government. For a long while — 
we may be thankful for that, at 
least — the cough did not bother 
him. 

And so the years passed. 



W HEN Wainer was forty-two, 
he met the girl. Her name 
was Lila. She was a Rash, a 
teacher of mnemonics, and all I 
can remember of her are the 
dark-brown lovely eyes, and 
the warm, adoring face. She was 
the only woman that Wainer ever 
really loved, except perhaps his 
mother, and he chose to have his 
child by her. 

Because of the population 
problem, a man could have one 
child then every hundred years. 
Wainer had his child by Lila, and 
although he was very happy that 
the boy turned out to be a Rash, 
he never paid him much atten- 
tion. 

He was about fifty then and 
beginning to break down. So that 
he could see Lila often and with 
pride, he wrote a great deal dur- 
ing those years, and his lungs 
were collapsing all that while. It 
was out of that period that he 
wrote all his symphonies from 
the Second to the Ninth. 

It is unbelievable: they were 
all purely commercial. He tossed 
them out with a part of his mind. 
I cannot help but wonder what 
the rest of that mind was doing. 

I can see him now, that gaunt 
and useless man, his great mus- 
cled arms chained to a pen, his 
stony, stretching legs cramped 
down beneath a desk . 

I did not see him again for 
almost ten years, because he went 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



away. He left New York for per- 
haps the only time in his life, and 
began to wander across the in- 
land of the American continent. 
I heard from him rarely. I think 
it was in one of those letters that 
he first mentioned the pain that 
was beginning in his lungs. 

I never knew what he did, or 
how he lived during those ten 
years. Perhaps he went into the 
forests and worked and lived like 
a primitive, and perhaps he just 
walked. He had no transporta- 
tion. I know that he was not 
wholly sane then, and never was 
again until the end of his life. 
He was like a magnificent ma- 
chine which has run out of tune 
for too many years — the delicate 
gears were strained and cracking. 

(The old man paused in the 
utter silence, while several tears 
dropped down his cheek. None 
of Them moved, and at last he 
went on.) 

Near the end of the ten years, 
I received a package from him in 
the mail. In it was a letter and 
the manuscript to the Storm in 
Space Overture. He wanted me 
to register the work and get the 
government fee, and he asked me 
the only favor he had ever asked 
of anyone, that I get him the 
money, because he was going into 
space. 

He came back some weeks 
later, on foot. I had gotten the 
money from Rejects — they had 



heard the Overture — it was 
enough. He brought Lila with 
him and was going to make res- 
ervations. He was heading, I 
think, only as far as Alpha Cen- 
tauri. 

It was too late. 

rw^HEY examined him, as some- 
one should have a long time 
ago, as someone would have if 
he had only ever asked, but in 
the end it would have made no 
difference either way, and it was 
now that they found out about 
his lungs. 

There was nothing anyone could 
do. At first I could not believe it. 
People did not get sick and die. 
People just did not die ! Because 
I was only a Reject and a sur- 
geon, no Rash doctor had ever 
told me that this had happened 
before, many times, to other men. 
I heard it not from the Rashes, 
but from Wainer. 

His lungs were beginning to 
atrophy. They were actually dy- 
ing within his body, and no one 
as yet knew why, or could stop it. 
He could be kept alive without 
lungs, yes, for a long while. I 
asked if we could graft a lung 
into him and this is what I was 
told : Because no one had yet 
synthesized human tissue, the 
graft would have to be a human 
lung, and in this age of longevity 
there were only a few available. 
Those few, of course, went only

to important men, and Wainer 
was nothing. 

I volunteered a lung of my 
own, as did Lila, as did many 
Rejects. There was hope for a 
while, but when I looked into 
Wainer's chest I saw for myself 
that there was no way to connect. 
So much was wrong, so much 
inside him was twisted and 
strange that I could not under- 
stand how he had lived at all. 
When I learned of the other men 
who had been like this, I asked 
what had been done. The answer 
was that nothing had been done 
at all. 

So Wainer did not go out into 
space. He returned instead to his 
single room to sit alone and wait, 
while the cool world around him 
progressed and revolved, while 
the city and its people went on 
without notice, while a voucher 
was being prepared somewhere, 
allowing the birth of another 
child because citizen Wainer 
would soon be dead. 

What could the man have 
thought, that huge, useless man? 
When he sat by his window and 
watched the world moving by, 
and looked up at night to the 
stars, and when he drank cool 
water, or breathed morning air, 
or walked or sat or lay down, 
what was there for him to think? 

He had one life, the same as 
any man, one time to be upon 
the Earth, and it was ending now 



as a record of nothing, as a piece 
of loneliness carved with great 
pain, as a celestial abortion, with- 
ered, wasted. There was nothing 
in his life, nothing, nothing, which 
he had ever panted to be, and 
now he was dying without reason 
in a world without reason, un- 
used, empty, collapsing, alone. 

He went down to the beach 
again. 

In the days that came, he was 
a shocking sight. What was hap£ 
pening became known, and when 
he walked the streets people 
stared at the wonder, the sick- 
ness, the man who was dying. 
Therefore he went out to the 
beaches and slept and took no 
treatments and no one will ever 
know what was in his mind, his 
million-faceted mind, as he wait- 
ed to die. 

W/ELL, it was told to me at 
last because I knew Wainer, 
and they needed him. It was told 
hesitantly, but when I heard it 
I broke away and ran, and in 
the clean air of the beach I found 
Wainer and told him. 

At first he did not listen. I re- 
peated it several times. I told him 
what the Rashes had been able to 
Jearn. He stood breathing heavily, 
face to the Sun, staring out over 
the incoming sea. Then I knew 
what he was thinking. 

The Rashes had told me this: 

The atrophy of the lungs was 



114

not all that happened' but it was 
the major thing, and it came only 
to Rejects. After years of study, 
it could be stated, cautiously, that 
the disease seemed to be in the 
nature of an evolutionary change. 
For many years they had probed 
for the cause of the Rejects, and 
the final conclusion — to be kept 
from the people — was that there 
was some variation in the brain 
of the Reject, something subtly, 
unfathomably different from the 
> brain of a Rash. And so it was 

also with the lungs, and with 
other parts of the body. And the 
scientists thought it was Evolu- 
tion. 

I told this to Wainer, and more, 
while peace spread slowly across 
his rugged face. I said that the 
nature of life was to grow and 
adapt, and that no one knew why. 
The first cells grew up in the sea 
and then learned to live on land, 
and eventually lifted themselves 
to the air, and now certainly 
there was one last step to be 
taken. 

The next phase of change 
would be into space, and it was 
clear now what Wainer was, 
what all the Rejects were. 

Wainer was a link, incomplete, 
groping, unfinished. A link. 

It meant more to him, I think, 
than any man can ever really 
understand. He had a purpose, 
after all, but it was more than 
that. He was a creature with a 



home. He was part of the Uni- 
verse more deeply than any of us 
had ever been. In the vast eternal 
plan which only You and Your 
kind can see, Wainer was a be- 
ginning, vital part. All the long 
years were not wasted. The pain 
of the lungs was dust and air. 

Wainer looked at me and I 
shall never forget his face. He was 
a man at peace who has lived 
long enough. 

(Because They knew much 
more than the old man could ever 
know, They were utterlv. naked- 
ly absorbed, and the silence of 
the room w s absolute. The old 
man tired and closed to the end, 
while They — unbreathing, undy- 
ing, telepathic and more, the in- 
conceivable next phase in the 
Evolution of Man — listened and 
learned.) 

TTE lived for another six 
months, long enough to take 
part in the experiments the 
Rashes had planned, and to write 
the Tenth Symphony. Even the 
Rashes could not ignore the 
Tenth. 

It was Wainer’s valedictory, a 
sublime, triumphant summation, 
born of his hope for the future of 
Man. It was more than music; it 
was a cathedral in sound. It was 
Wainer’s soul. 

Wainer never lived to hear it 
played, to hear himself become 
famous, and in the end, I know, 



WAINER 



115 



he did not care. Although we 
could have saved him for a little 
while, although I pleaded with 
him to remain for the sake of his 
woman and his music, Wainer 
knew that the pattern of his life 
was finished, that the ending time 
was now. 

For Wainer went out into space 
at last, into the sweet dark home 
between the stars, moving toward 
the only great moment he would 
ever have. 

The Rashes wanted to see how 
his lungs would react in alien 
atmospheres. Not in a laboratory 
— Wainer refused — but out in the 
open Sun, out in the strange alien 
air of the worlds themselves, 
Wainer was set down. On each 
of a dozen poisonous worlds he 
walked. He opened his helmet 
while we tiny men watched. He 
breathed. 

And he lived. 

He lived through methane, 
through carbon dioxide, through 
nitrogen and propane. He existed 
without air at all for an incredible 
time, living all the while as he 
never had before, with a won- 
derful, glowing excitement. And 
then at last there was that final 



world which was corrosive. It was 
too much, and Wainer smiled re- 
gretfully, holding himself upright 
with dignity by the base of an 
alien rock, and still smiling, never 
once moving to close his helmet, 
he died. 

npHERE was a long pause. The 
■*- old man was done. 

They looked at him with the 
deep compassion that his own 
race had denied to those who 
were different or lesser than them- 
selves. 

One of Them arose and gently 
spoke. 

“And now you are the last of 
your kind, as alone as Wainer 
was. We are sorry.” 

There was no bitterness in the 
old man’s voice. “Don’t be. 
Wainer was content to die, know- 
ing that he was the link between 
us and You. Yet neither he nor 
You could have been if humanity 
had never existed. We had our 
place in the endless flow of his- 
tory. We were, so to speak, 
Wainer’s parents and Your grand- 
parents. I, too, am content, proud 
of the children of Man.”

THE BEST SCIENCE FIC- 
TION STORIES, 1953. Edited 
by Everett F. Bleiler and T. E. 
Dikty. Frederick Fell, Inc., New 
York, 1953. 279 pages, $3.50 

^l^HE fifth Bleiler-Dikty annu- 
al maintains the same stand- 
ards as its predecessors, with an 
extra bonus in the form of a 
slashing attack by Alfred Bester 
on the immaturity of much 
science fiction — an essay that 
every science fiction reader and 
writer should read with prayerful 
attention. 

The book contains 15 stories, 
four of which have already been 



anthologized elsewhere. There is 
more fantasy than heretofore, 
thus reinforcing a trend already 
noticeable in some magazines. 
The best items, however, are 
science fiction — stories by Wil- 
liam Temple, Mark Clifton, Wal- 
ter Miller, Frank Robinson, and 
two by Eric Frank Russell. 

The rest of the items are good 
reading, too, on the whole, though 
certain of them do not rate, in 
my mind, among the 15 best of 
the year, by any means. Never- 
theless, the collection is a good 
cross-section of the 1952 (NOT 
1953) magazine output that was 
available.

FLYING SAUCERS FROM 
OUTER SPACE by Donald E. 
Keyhoe. Henry Holt and Co., 
New York, 1953. 276 pages, $3.00 

A FTER reading this book, I 
wonder whether certain pun- 
dits of modern science haven’t 
got themselves out on a fragile 
limb by denying the existence of 
Flying Saucers and the possibil- 
ity that they may be extrater- 
restrial in origin. 

The amount of evidence that 
the U.S. Armed Forces released 
recently, plus the way in which 
certain competent officials have 
“reversed the field” and now seem 
to agree that (if the Saucers are 
real) the only explanation can 
be that they are of intelligent 
extraterrestrial origin, certainly 
gives Keyhoe’s theories a cer- 
tain measure of rationality. His 
source material is almost omin- 
ously persuasive. 

Unfortunately, the author 
weakens his evidence by present- 
ing it as a semi-fictional suspense 
story, a thoroughly unscientific 
approach. It is hardly a solid and 
reasoned study of the evidence — 
and yet that evidence is unassail- 
ably factual. 

Despite the author’s sensation- 
alism, this book should be read 
by anyone who wants to know 
more about the increasing offi- 
cial concern over the Flying Sau- 
cer mystery. 



E PLURIBUS UNICORN by 
Theodore Sturgeon. Abelard 
Press, New York, 1953. 276 pages,

R ARELY will you find within 
the covers of one book such 
a wide spectrum of fantasies as 
in this, Sturgeon’s second short 
story collection. And even more 
rarely will you find such a con- 
tinuously high level of writing. 
These thirteen yarns are genuine- 
ly distinguished stuff. 

Many of the tales will be un- 
familiar to readers of “pure” 
science fiction, since most of them 
come from the left-hand, or grue- 
some-weird, drawer of Sturgeon’s 
mind. And every one of them is 
worth encountering; every one 
will leave a permanent mark (or 
should I say cicatrice?) on your 
memory. In them you will en- 
counter depths of horror and 
soaring heights of poetic imagina- 
tion such as few writers of this 
generation are able to evoke. 
Don’t miss it!

T HE author of that smash hit 
of 1951, The Day of the Trif- 
fids, has written what is in all 
ways a better and a more en- 
thralling book in this, his second 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



full-length novel. It is written 
with a charm, a satirical sharp- 
ness, and a sense for character 
and story line that is reminis- 
cent of Fowler Wright at his 
best — plus a clarity and econ- 
omy of language that the author 
of Deluge never could seem to 
command. 

The plot is old, yet very fresh- 
ly done. Things from space drop 
into the ocean deeps; no one be- 
lieves they are real. Time passes 
and villages on tropic isles begin 
to be raided by fantastic amphib- 
ious tank machines, as the raiders 
try to take over. That menace ev- 
entually is conquered, though 
only after heavy loss of life 
throughout the ocean -bordering 
lands. But then the aliens in the 
deeps work out a monstrous new 
method of attack— one I won’t 
tell you about. Suffice to say that, 
as a result of it, the population of 
England is reduced to 5,000,000 
and civilization is nearly annihi- 
lated before a defense is found. 

It’s all sheer melodrama, sure, 
but melodrama spiced with wit, 
with pungent commentary on hu- 
man foibles, with sharp attacks 
on human complacency and con- 
ceit — a’ truly satisfying shocker. 

THE BEST FROM START- 
LING STORIES, edited by 
Samuel Mines. Henry Holt and 
Co., New York, 1953. 301 pages, 
$3.50 



•T^HIS slim collection of 11 tales 
(about 32c each!) contains 
only three really good ones — 
Sturgeon’s “The Wages of Syn- 
ergy,” Bradbury’s already well- 
known “The Naming of Names,” 
and Arthur Clarke’s vividly hor- 
rible “Thirty Seconds — Thirty 
Days,” previously published in 
an English anthology under the 
title “Breaking Strain.” 

Of the other stories, Edmond 
Hamilton’s “What’s It Like Out 
There?” is powerful but over- 
done; A. E. van Vogt’s “Dor- 
mant” is a too-terrific concept 
that nevertheless chills you; and 
Sherwood Springer’s “No Land 
of Nod” takes a new and realistic 
look at the sexual implications of 
the post-Atomic Adam and Eve 
idea, but does it much too por- 
tentously. 

I do not think the rest of the 
tales deserve reprinting. 

STAR MAN'S SON (and) 
STAR RANGERS by Andre

New York, 1952 and 1953. Each 
$2.95 

A NEW writer of science fiction 
juveniles is always welcome 
— particularly when his (or, in 
this case, her) stories are of high 
quality. Indeed, these two tales 
are sufficiently well done to hold 
the attention of any adult who 
wants to relax in some high (and

often a bit bloody) adventures in 
distant tomorrows. 

Star Man's Son tells of a post- 
Atomic world that has returned 
to savagery, and how a mutant 
member of a mountain clan — 
after innumerable escapes and 
conflicts — brings the plains tribes 
together with his program to 
plant the seeds of a new and non- 
warlike civilization. It’s an al- 
most cruelly vivid story, with a 
fine ethical viewpoint that raises 
it several levels above the aver- 
age. 

Star Rangers tells of a crew of 
the Stellar Patrol in the year 
8054, making a forced landing on 
a seemingly uncivilized planet 
at the Galaxy’s edge. How they 
fare, their adventures with the 
passengers and crew of a galactic 
empire spaceship that had landed 
earlier, and the final identifica- 
tion of the planet and its place 
in the galactic scheme all add up 
to an enthralling story. 

Here again, we have a strong 
plea for racial tolerance and 
friendship that makes the book 
more than just a science fantasy 
thriller. 

SPACE, SPACE, SPACE. Ed- 
ited by William Sloane. Franklin 
Watts, Inc., New York, 1953. 
288 pages, $2.50 

HPHERE are only ten stories 
-*■ in this collection, but the com- 



bination of high quality superb 
bookmaking (it reminds one of 
the old days when books could 
be handsome at a reasonable 
price), and a pleasant set of ed- 
itorial notes all make it stand out 
among the current anthologies. 

Seven of the tales are B or 
better and three are rather minor 
— on the whole, an excellent 
cross-section of space travel and 
alien invasion stories. Only one 
has appeared previously in an 
anthology — Eric Frank Russell’s 
superb “Dear Devil.” 

This book is one of a series of 
special-subject anthologies de- 
signed primarily for use in high 
school libraries and similar out- 
lets. It is a distinguished addition 
to that series. 

THE BLACK STAR PASSES 
by John W. Campbell, Jr. Fan- 
tasy Press, Reading, Pa., 1953. 
256 pages, $3.00 

rFiHREE creaking classics from 
the infancy of modern science 
fiction are presented in this new 
book by the editor of Astounding 
Science Fiction — novelets that 
are fun to read, provided you 
constantly bear in mind that they 
are rococo antiques and not 
science fiction as we understand 
it today. Believable characters, 
human relations, even logical 
plots, these stories have none of. 
Inventions, gimmicks, impossibil- 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ities are there in full flood. 

In the first tale alone, called 
“Piracy Preferred,” we have an 
invisibility machine and a “per- 
fect” solar energy motor^ together 
with some cops-and-robbers 
chasing through the stratosphere. 

“Solarite” and “The Black Star 
Passes,” the other two stories, go 
on from there into Outer Space, 
with the same Super-scientists 
inventing new Super-gadgets and 
staving off new Super -varieties 
of Invincible Monsters, though, I 
assure you, infinitely better than 
the stuff that was being published 
(and still is) by men of lesser 
innate caliber than John Camp- 
bell. 

All three tales were originally 
published in 1930, and those of 
you who are old enough to have 
read them will probably have a 
wonderful time bathing in the 
nostalgia of those simple days of 
comic-book plots, cardboard 
characters and Buck Rogers gad- 
gets. 

Younger fans may find the 
mixture more difficult to take, 
with its hard-breathing style and 
its incredibilities, but even they 
may get a bang out of tasting a 
bit of the original brew from 
which has mutated much of the 
best of today’s science fantasy. 

As Mr. Campbell says in intro- 
ducing his stories, while they 
“don’t have the finesse of later 
work, they have a bounding en- 



thusiasm that belongs with a 
young field, designed for and 
built by young men.” 

THE WHITE WIDOWS by 
Sam Merwin, Jr. Doubleday and 
Co., New York, 1953. 244 pages, 
$2.95 

rpRAVELING with Sam Mer- 
win as a science fiction writer 
is like being on a fantastic roller- 
coaster. With one book, you’re 
on the crest — fine, wind-blown 
stuff, all pace and flash and im- 
agination, like Killer to Come, 
reviewed in the February GAL- 
AXY. Then, with the next, like 
this one, you’re in the trough. 

This one is about an ancient 
underground conspiracy of wo- 
men to get rid of (or dominate) 
men. The conspiracy is coming to 
a head in our time because of the 
discovery of methods of creating 
children by parthogenesis. 

There are a Bright Young 
Hero, several Beautiful Females, 
a Fantastic Fat Scientist, and a 
lot about that most fashionable 
of all modern science fiction doo- 
hickeys, “Psi” powers (the “fem- 
inists” all seem to have ’em) — 
and in the end there is a bloody 
big “boom” as the conspiracy 
“seems” to be destroyed. 

The book reads fast. But no 
matter how fast you read, you 
can’t escape its implausibility.

As a cosmic art dealer, Jones 
knew art, but he did not know 
what he liked— until he met— 



BLACK 

CHARLIE 

By GORDON R. DICKSON 

Illustrated by EMSH 



Y OU ask me, what is art? 
You expect me to have a 
logical answer at my fin- 
gertips, because I have been a 
buyer for museums and galleries 
long enough to acquire a plenti- 
ful crop of gray hairs. It’s not 
that simple. 

Well, what is art? For forty 
years I’ve examined, felt, ad- 
mired and loved many things 
fashioned as hopeful vessels for 
that bright spirit we call art — 
and I’m unable to answer the 
question directly. The layman 
answers easily — beauty. But art 
is not necessarily beautiful. 
Sometimes it is ugly. Sometimes 
it is crude. Sometimes it is in- 
complete. 

I have fallen back, as many 



men have in the business of mak- 
ing like decisions, on fee/, for the 
judgment of art. You know this 
business of feel. Let us say that 
you pick up something. A piece 
of statuary — or better, a frag- 
ment of stone, etched and colored 
by some ancient man of pre- 
historic times. You look at it. At 
first it is nothing, a half-devel- 
oped reproduction of some wild 
animal, not even as good as a 
grade-school child could accom- 
plish today. 

But then, holding it, your 
imagination suddenly reaches 
through rock and time, back to 
the man himself, half-squatted 
before the stone wall of his cave 
— and you see there, not the 
dusty thing you hold in your 



BLACK CHARLIE 



123 



hand — but what the man himself 
saw in the hour of its creation. 
You look beyond the physical 
reproduction to the magnificent 
accomplishment of his imagina- 
tion. 

This, then, may be called art 
— no matter what strange guise 
'it appears in — this magic which 
bridges all gaps between the 
artist and yourself. To it, no dis- 
tance, nor any difference is too 
great. Let me give you an ex- 
ample from my own experience. 

COME years back, when I was 
^ touring the newer worlds as a 
buyer for one of our well-known 
art institutions, I received a com- 
munication from a man named 
Cary Longan, asking me, if pos- 
sible, to visit a planet named El- 
man’s World and examine some 
statuary he had for sale. 

Messages rarely came directly 
to me. They were usually re- 
ferred to me by the institution I 
was representing at the time. 
Since, however, the world in 
question was close, being of the 
same solar system as the planet 
I was then visiting, I space- 
graphed my answer that I would 
come. After cleaning up what 
remained of my business where 
I was, I took an interworld ship 
and, within a couple of days, 
landed on Elman’s World. 

It appeared to be a very raw, 
very new planet indeed. The port 



we landed at was, I learned, one 
of the only two suitable for deep- 
space vessels. And the city sur- 
rounding it was scarcely more 
than a village. Mr. Longan did 
not meet me at the port, so I 
took a cab directly to the hotel 
where I had made a reservation. 

That evening, in my rooms, the 
annunciator rang, then spoke, 
giving me a name. I opened the 
door to admit a tall, brown-faced 
man, with uncut, dark hair and 
troubled, green-brown eyes. 

“Mr. Longan?” I asked. 

“Mr. Jones?” he countered. He 
shifted the unvarnished wooden 
box he was carrying to his left 
hand and put out his right to 
shake mine. I closed the door be- 
hind him and led him to a chair. 

He put the box down, without 
opening it, on a small coffee table 
between us. It was then that I 
noticed his rough, bush-country 
clothes, breeches and tunic of 
drab plastic. Also an embarrassed 
air about him, like that of a man 
unused to city dealings. An odd 
sort of person to be offering art 
for sale. 

“Your spacegram,” I told him, 
“was not very explicit. The in- 
stitution I represent . .” 

“I’ve got it here,” he said, put- 
ting his hand on the box. 

I looked at it in astonishment. 
It was no more than half a meter 
square by twenty centimeters 
deep.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“There?” I said. I looked back 
at him, with the beginnings of a 
suspicion forming in my mind. 

I suppose I should have been 
more wary when the message had 
come direct, iftstead of through 
Earth. But you know how it is 
— something of a feather in your 
cap when you bring in an unex- 
pected item. “Tell me, Mr. Lon- 
gan,” I said, “where does this 
statuary come from?” 

TIE looked at me, a little de- 
fiantly. “A friend of mine 
made them,” he said. 

“A friend?” I repeated — and I 
must admit I was growing some- 
what annoyed. It makes a man 
feel like a fool to be taken in 
that way. “May I ask whether 
this friend of yours has ever sold 
any of his work before?” 

“Well, no . .” Longa n hedged. 
He was obviously suffering — but 
so was I, when I thought of my 
own wasted time. 

“I see,” I said, getting to my 
feet. “You’ve brought me on a 
very expensive side- trip, merely 
to show me the work of some 
amateur. Good-by, Mr. Longan. 
And please take your box with 
you when you leave!” 

“You’ve never seen anything 
like this before!” He was looking 
up at me with desperation. 

“No doubt,” I said. 

“Look. I’ll show you . .” He 
fumbled, his fingers nervous on 



the hasp. “Since you’ve come all 
this way, you can at least look.” 

Because there seemed no way 
of getting him out of there, short 
of having the hotel manager eject 
him forcibly, I sat down with bad 
grace. “What’s your friend’s 
name?” I demanded. 

Longan’s fingers hesitated on 
the hasp. “Black Charlie,” he re- 
plied, not looking up at me. 

I stared. “I beg your pardon. 
Black — Charles Black?” 

He looked up quite defiantly, 
met my eye and shook his head. 
"Just Black Charlie,” he said 
with sudden calmness. “Just the 
way it sounds. Black Charlie.” 
He continued unfastening the 
box. 

I watched rather dubiously, as 
he finally managed to loosen the 
clumsy, handmade wooden bolt 
that secured the hasp. He was 
about to raise the lid, then ap- 
parently changed his mind. He 
turned the box around and 
pushed it across the coffee table. 

The wood was hard and un- 
even under my fingers. I lifted 
the lid. There were five small 
partitions, each containing a rock 
of fine-grained gray sandstone of 
different but thoroughly incom- 
prehensible shape. 

I stared at them — then looked 
back at Longan, to see if this 
weren’t some sort of elaborate 
joke. But the tall man’s eyes were 
severely serious. Slowly, I began 



BLACK CHARLIE

to take out the stones and line 
them up on the table. 

T STUDIED them one by one, 
* trying to make some sense out 
of their forms. But there was 
nothing there, absolutely nothing. 
One vaguely resembled a regu- 
lar-sided pyramid. Another gave 
a foggy impression of a crouch- 
ing figure. The best that could 
be said of the rest was that they 
bore a somewhat disconcerting 
resemblance to the kind of stones 
people pick up for paperweights. 
Yet they all had obviously been 
worked on. There were noticeable 
chisel marks on each one. And, in 
addition, they had been polished 
as well as such soft, grainy rock 
could be. 

I looked up at Longan. His 
eyes were tense with waiting. I 
was completely puzzled about 
his discovery — or what he felt 
was a discovery. I tried to be fair 
about his acceptance of this as 
art. It was obviously nothing 
more than loyalty to a friend, a 
friend no doubt as unaware of 
what constituted art as himself. 
I made my tone as kind as I 
could. 

‘‘What did your friend expect 
me to do with these, Mr. Lon- 
gan?” I asked gently. 

“Aren’t you buying things for 
that museum-place on Earth?” 
he said. 

I nodded. I picked up the piece 



that resembled a crouching ani- 
mal figure and turned it over in 
my fingers. It was an awkward 
situation. “Mr. Longan,” I said. 
“I have been in this business 
many years . .” 

“I know,” he interrupted. “I 
read about you in the newsfax 
when you landed on the next 
world. That’s why I wrote you.” 
“I see,” I said. “Well, I’ve been 
in it a long time, as I say and, I 
think, I can safely boast that I 
know something about art. If 
there is art in these carvings your 
friend has made, I should be able 
to recognize it. And I do not.” 
He stared at me, shock in his 
greenish-brown eyes. 

“You’re . he said, finally. 
“You don’t mean that. You’re 
sore because I brought you out 
here this way.” 

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m not 
sore and I do mean it. These 
things are not merely not good 
— there is nothing of value in 
them. Nothing! Someone has de- 
luded your friend into thinking 
that he has talent. You’ll be do- 
ing him a favor if you tell him 
the truth.” 

ITE stared at me for a long 
moment, as if waiting for 
me to say something to soften the 
verdict. Then, suddenly, he rose 
from the chair and crossed the 
room in three long strides, star- 
ing tensely out the window. His 



126

calloused hands clenched and 
unclenched spasmodically. 

I gave him a little time to 
wrestle it out with himself. Then 
I started putting the pieces of 
stone back into their sections of 
the box. 

“I’m sorry,” I told him. 

He wheeled about and came 
back to me, leaning down from 
his lanky height to look in my 
face. “Are you?” he said. “Are 
you?” 

“Believe me,” I said sincerely, 
“I am.” And I was. 

“Then will you do something 
for me?” The words came in a 
rush. “Will you come and tell 
Charlie what you’ve told me? 
Will you break the news to him?” 

“I ...” I meant to protest, to 
beg off, but with his tortured 
eyes six inches from mine, the 
words would not come. “All 
right,” I said. 

The breath he had been hold- 
ing came out in one long sigh. 
“Thanks,” he said. “We’ll go out 
tomorrow. You don’t know what 
this means. Thanks.” 

I had ample time to regret my 
decision, both that night and the 
following morning, when Longan 
roused me at an early hour, fur- 
nished me with a set of bush 
clothes like his own, including 
high, impervious boots, and 
whisked me off in old air- ground 
combination flyer that was load- 
ed down with all kinds of bush- 



dweller’s equipment. But a 
promise is a promise — and I rec- 
onciled myself to keeping mine. 

We flew south along a high 
chain of mountains until we 
came to a coastal area and what 
appeared to be the swamp delta 
of some mdnster river. Here, we 
began to descend — much to my 
distaste. I have little affection 
for hot, muggy climates and 
could not conceive of anyone 
wanting to live under such con- 
ditions. 

We set down lightly in a little 
open stretch of water — and Lon- 
gan taxied the flyer across to the 
nearest bank, a tussocky mass of 
high brown weeds and soft mud. 
By myself, I would not have 
trusted the soggy ground to re- 
frain from drawing me down like 
quicksand — but Longan stepped 
out onto the bank confidently 
enough, and I followed. The mud 
yielded, little pools of water 
springing up around my boot 
soles. A hot rank smell of decay- 
ing vegetation came to my nose. 
Under a thin but uniform blan- 
ket of cloud, the sky looked 
white and sick. 

“This way,” said Longan, and 
led off to the right. 

I followed him along a little 
trail and into a small, 
swampy clearing with dome- 
shaped huts of woven branches, 
plastered with mud, scattered

about it. And. for the first time, 
it struck me that Black Charlie 
might be something other than 
an expatriate Earthman — might, 
indeed, be a native of this planet, 
though I had heard of no other 
humanlike race on other worlds 
before. My head spinning, I fol- 
lowed Longan to the entrance of 
one of the huts and halted as he 
whistled. 

I don’t remember now what I 
expected to see. Something va- 
guely humanoid, no doubt. But 
what came through the entrance 
in response to Longan’s whistle 
was more like a large otter, with 
flat, muscular grasping pads on 
the ends of its four limbs, instead 
of feet. It was black, with glossy, 
dampish hair all over it. About 
four feet in length, I judged, with 
no visible tail and a long, snaky 
neck. The creature must have 
weighed one hundred to, per- 
haps, one hundred and fifty 
pounds. The head on its long 
neck was also long and narrow, 
like the head of a well-bred col- 
lie — covered with the same black 
hair, with bright, intelligent eyes 
and a long mouth. 

“This is Black Charlie,” said 
Longan. 

The creature stared at me and 
I returned his gaze. Abruptly, I 
was conscious of the absurdity of 
the situation. It would have been 
difficult for any ordinary person 
to think of this being as a sculp- 



tor. To add to this a necessity, 
an obligation, to convince it that 
it was not a sculptor — mind you, 
I could not be expected to know 
a word of its language — was to 
pile Pelion upon Ossa in a mad- 
man’s farce. I swung on Longan. 

“Look here,” I began with 
quite natural heat, “how do you 
expect me to tell — ” 

“He, understands you,” inter- 
rupted Longan. 

“Speech?” I said, incredulous- 
ly, “Real human speech?” 

“No,” Longan shook his head. 
“But he understands actions.” 
He turned from me abruptly and 
plunged into the weeds surround- 
ing the clearing. He returned im- 
mediately with two objects that 
looked like gigantic puffballs, 
and handed one to me. 

“Sit on this,” he said, doing 
so himself. I obeyed. 

T> LACK Charlie — I could 
** think of nothing else to call 
him — came closer, and we sat 
down together. Charlie was half- 
squatting on ebony haunches. 
All this time, I had been carrying 
the wooden box that contained 
his sculptures and, now that we 
were seated, his bright eyes 
swung inquisitively toward it. 

“All right,” said Longan, “give 
it to me.” 

I passed him the box, and it 
drew Black Charlie’s eyes like a 
magnet. Longan took it under one 



BLACK CHARLIE

arm and pointed toward the lake 
with the other — to where we had 
landed the flyer. Then his arm 
rose in the air in a slow, impres- 
sive circle and pointed north- 
ward, from the direction we had 
come. 

Black Charlie whistled sud- 
denly. It was an odd note, like 
the cry of a loon — a far, sad 
sound. 

Longan struck himself on the 
chest, holding the box with one 
hand. Then he struck the box 
and pointed to me. He looked at 
Black Charlie, looked back at 
me — then put the box into my 
numb hands. 

“Look them over and hand 
them back,” he said, his voice 
tight. Against my will, I looked 
at Charlie. 

His eyes met mine. Strange, 
liquid, black inhuman eyes, like 
two tiny pools of pitch. I had to 
tear my own gaze away. 

Torn between my feeling of 
foolishness and a real sympathy 
for the waiting creature, I awk- 
wardly opened the box and lifted 
the stones from their compart- 
ments. One by one, I turned 
them in my hand and put them 
back. I closed the box and re- 
turned it to Longan, shaking my 
head, not knowing if Charlie 
would understand that. 

For a long moment, Longan 
merely sat facing me, holding the 
box. Then, slowly, he turned and 



set it, still open, in front of 
Charlie. 

C HARLIE did not react at 
first. His head, on its long 
neck, dropped over the open 
compartments as if he was sniff- 
ing them. Then, surprisingly, his 
lips wrinkled back, revealing 
Jong, chisel-shaped teeth. Daint- 
ily, he reached into the box with 
these and lifted out the stones, 
one by one. He held them in his 
forepads, turning them this way 
and that, as if searching for the 
defects of each. Finally, he lifted 
one — it was the stone that faintly 
resembled a crouching beast. He 
lifted it to his mouth — and, with 
his gleaming teeth, made slight 
alterations in its surface. Then he 
brought it to me. 

Helplessly I took it in my 
hands and examined it. The 
changes he had made in no way 
altered it toward something rec- 
ognizable. I was, forced to hand 
it back, with another headshake, 
and a poignant pause fell be- 
tween us. 

I had been desperately turning 
over in my mind some way to 
explain, through the medium of 
pantomime, the reasons for my 
refusal. Now, something occurred 
to me. I turned to Longan. 

“Can he get me a piece of un- 
worked stone?” I asked. 

Longan turned to Charlie and 
made motions as if he were 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



breaking something off and 
handing it to me. For a moment, 
Charlie sat still, as if consider- 
ing this. Then he went into his 
hut, returning a moment later 
with a chunk of rock the size of 
my hand. 

I had a small pocket knife, and 
the rock was soft. I held the rock 
out toward Longan and looked 
from him to it. Using my pocket 
knife, I whittled a rough, lumpy 
caricature of Longan, seated on 
the puffball. When I was fin- 
ished, I put the two side by side, 
the hacked piece of stone insigni- 
ficant on the ground beside the 
living man. 

Black Charlie looked at it. 
Then he came up to me — and, 
peering up into my face, cried 
softly, once. Moving so abruptly 
that it startled me, he turned 
smoothly, picked up in his teeth 
the piece of stone I had carved. 
Soon he disappeared back into 
his hut. 

Longan stood up stiffly, like a 
man who has held one position 
too long. “That’s it,” he said. 
“Let’s go.” 

We made our way to the com- 
bination and took off once more, 
headed back toward the city and 
the spaceship that would carry 
me away from this irrational 
world. As the mountains com- 
menced to rise, far beneath us, I 
stole a glance at Longan, sitting 
beside me at the controls of the 



combination. His face was set in 
an expression of stolid unhappi- 
ness. 

^FHE question came from my 
lips before I had time to de- 
bate internally whether it was 
wise or not to ask it. 

“Tell me, Mr. Longan,” I said, 
“has — er — Black Charlie some 
special claim on your friend- 
ship?” 

The tall man looked at me 
with something close to amaze- 
ment. 

“Claim!” he said. Then, after 
a short pause, during which he 
seemed to search my features to 
see if I was joking. “He saved my 
life.” 

“Oh,” I said. “I see.” 

“You do, do you?” he count- 
ered. “Suppose I told you it was 
just after I’d finished killing his 
mate. They mate for life, you 
know.” 

“No, I didn’t know,” I an- 
swered feebly. 

"I forget people don’t know,” 
he said in a subdued voice. I 
said nothing, hoping that, if I 
did not disturb him, he would 
say more. After a while he spoke. 
“This planet’s not much good.” 

"I noticed,” I answered. “I 
didn’t see much in the way of 
plants and factories. And your 
sister world — the one I came 
from — is much more populated 
and built up.” 



BLACK CHARLIE

“There’s not much here,” he 
said. “No minerals to speak of. 
Climate’s bad, except on the pla- 
teaus. Soil’s not much good.” He 
paused. It seemed to take effort 
to say what came next. “Used 
to have a novelty trade in furs, 
though.” 

“Furs?” I echoed. 

“Off Charlie’s people,” he went 
on, fiddling with the combina- 
tion’s controls. “Trappers and 
hunters used to be after them, at 
first, before they knew. I was 
one of them.” 

“You!” I said. 

“Me!” His voice was flat. “I 
was doing fine, too, until I 
trapped Charlie’s mate. Up till 
then, I’d been getting them out 
by themselves. They did a lot of 
traveling in those swamps. But, 
this time, I was close to the vil- 
lage. I’d just clubbed her on the 
head when the whole tribe 
jumped me.” His voice trailed 
off, then strengthened. “They 
kept me under guard for a couple 
of months. 

“I learned a lot in that time. I 
learned they were intelligent. I 
learned it was Black Charlie who 
kept them from killing me right 
off. Seems he took the point of 
view that I was a reasonable be- 
ing and, if he could just talk 
things over with me, we could 
get together and end the war.” 
Longan laughed, a little bitterly. 
“They called it a war, Charlie’s 



people did.” He stopped talking. 

I waited. And when he re- 
mained quiet, I prompted him. 
“What happened?” I asked. 

“They let me go, finally,” he 
said. “And I went to bat for 
them. Clear up to the Commis- 
sioner sent from Earth. I got 
them recognized as people in- 
stead of animals. I put an end to 
the hunting and trapping.” 

He stopped again. We were 
still flying through the upper air 
of Elman’s World, the sun break- 
ing through the clouds at last, 
revealing the ground below like 
a huge green relief map. 

“I see,” I said, finally. 

Longan looked at me stonily. 

We flew back to the city. 

T left Elman’s World the next 
day, fully believing that I had 
heard and seen the last of both 
Longan and Black Charlie. Sev- 
eral years later, at home in New 
York, I was visited by a member 
of the government’s Foreign Ser- 
vice. He was a slight, dark man, 
and he didn’t beat about the 
bush. 

“You don’t know me,” he said. 
I looked at his card — Antonio 
Walters. “I was Deputy Colonial 
Representative on Elman’s 
World at the time you were 
there.” 

I looked up at him, surprised. 
I had forgotten Elman’s World 
by that time. 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Were you?” I asked, feeling 
a little foolish, unable to think 
of anything better to say. I turn- 
ed his card over several times, 
staring at it, as a person will do 
when at a loss. ‘‘What can I do 
for you, Mr. Walters?” 

“We’ve been requested by the 
local government on Elman’s 
World to locate you, Mr. Jones,” 
he answered. “Cary Longan is 
dying — ” 

“Dying!" I said. 

“Lung fungus, unfortunately,” 
said Walters. “You catch it in the 
swamps. He wants to see you be- 
fore the end — and, since we’re 
very grateful to him out there 
for the work he’s been doing all 
these years for the natives, a 
place has been kept for you on a 
government courier ship leaving 
for Elman’s World right away — 
if you’re willing to go.” 

“Why, I ...” I hesitated. In 
common decency, I could not re- 
fuse. “I’ll have to notify my em- 
ployers.” 

“Of course,” he said. 

¥ UCKILY, the arrangements I 
had to make consisted of 
a few business calls and pack- 
ing my bags. I was, as a mat- 
ter of fact, between trips at the 
time. As an experienced trav- 
eler, I could always get under 
way with a minimum of fuss. 
Walters and I drove out to Gov- 
ernment Port, in northern New 

BLACK CHARLIE 



Jersey and, from there on, the 
authorities took over. 

Less than a week later, I stood 
by Longan’s bedside in the hospi- 
tal of the same city I had visited 
years before. The man was now 
nothing more than a barely liv- 
ing skeleton, the hard vitality all 
but gone from him, hardly able 
to speak a few words at a time. 
I bent over to catch the whisper- 
ed syllables from his wasted lips. 

“Black Charlie . .” he whis- 
pered. 

“Black Charlie,” I repeated. 
“Yes, what about him?” 

“He’s done something new,” 
whispered Longan. “That carv- 
ing of yours started him off, 
copying things. His tribe don’t 
like it.” 

“They don’t?” I said. 

“They,” whispered Longon, 
“don’t understand. It’s not nor- 
mal, the way they see it. They’re 
afraid . .” 

“You mean they’re supersti- 
tious about what he carves?” I 
asked. 

“Something like that. Listen — 
he’s an artist . .” 

I winced internally at the last 
word, but held my tongue for 
the sake of the dying man. 

“. an artist. But they'll kill 
him for it, now that I’m gone. 
You can save him, though.” 

“Me?” I said. 

“You!” The man’s voice was 
like a wind rustling through dry 

133 






leaves. “If you go out — take this 
last thing from him — act pleased 
. then they’ll be scared to 
touch him. But hurry. Every day 
is that much closer . 

His strength failed him. He 
closed his eyes and his straining 
throat muscles relaxed to a little 
hiss of air that puffed between 
his lips. The nurse hurried me 
from his room. 

< r pHE local government helped 
-*• me. I was surprised, and not 
a little touched, to see how many 
people knew Longan. How many 
of them admired his attempts to 
pay back the natives by helping 
them in any way he could. They 
located Charlie’s tribe on a map 
for me and sent me out with a 
pilot who knew the country. 

We landed on the same patch 
of slime. I went alone toward the 
clearing. With the brown weeds 
still walling it about, the locale 
showed no natural change, but 
Black Charlie’s hut appeared 
broken and deserted. I whistled 
and waited. I called. And, finally, 
I got down on my hands and 
knees and crawled inside. But 
there was nothing there save a 
pile of loose rock and a mass of 
dried weeds. Feeling cramped 
and uncomfortable, for I am not 
used to such gymnastics, I back- 
ed out, to find myself surrounded 
by a crowd. 

It looked as if all the other in- 



habitants of the village had come 
out of their huts and congregated 
before Charlie’s. They seemed 
agitated, milling about, occasion- 
ally whistling at each other on 
that one low, plaintive note 
which was the only sound I had 
ever heard Charlie make. Event- 
ually, the excitement seemed to 
fade, the group fell back and one 
individual came forward alone. 
He looked up into my face for 
a brief moment, then turned and 
glided swiftly on his pads toward 
the edge of the clearing. 

I followed. There seemed noth- 
ing else to do. And, at that time, 
it did not occur to me to be 
afraid. 

My guide led me deep into 
the weed patch, then abruptly 
disappeared. I looked around 
surprised and undecided, half-in- 
clined to turn about and retrace 
my steps by the trail of crushed 
weeds I had left in my flounder- 
ing advance. Then, a low whistle 
sounded close by. I went forward 
and found Charlie. 

TTE lay on his side in a little 
circular open area of crush- 
ed weeds. He was too weak 
to do more than raise his head 
and look at me, for the whole 
surface of his body was criss- 
crossed and marked with the 
slashings of shallow wounds, 
from which dark blood seeped 
slowly and stained the reeds in 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



which he lay. In Charlie’s mouth, 
I had seen the long, chisel-teeth 
of his kind, and I knew what had 
made those wounds. A gust of 
rage went through me, and I 
stooped to pick him up in my 
arms. 

He came up easily, for the 
bones of his kind are cartilagin- 
ous, and their flesh is far lighter 
than our human flesh. Holding 
him, I turned and made my way 
back to the clearing. 

The others were waiting for 
me as we came out into the open. 
I glared at them — and then the 
rage inside me went out like a 
blown candle. For there was 
nothing there to hate. They had 
not hated Charlie. They had 
merely feared him — and their 
only crime was ignorance. 

They moved back from me, 
and I carried Charlie to the door 
of his own hut. There I laid him 
down. The chest and arms of my 
jacket were soaked from his dark 
body fluid, and I saw that his 
blood was not clotting as our 
own does. 

Clumsily, I took off my shirt 
and, tearing it into strips, made 
a poor attempt to bind up the 
torn flesh. But the blood came 
through in spite of my first aid. 
Charlie, lifting his head, with a 
great effort, from the ground, 
picked feebly at the bandages 
with his teeth, so that I gave up 
and removed them. 



I sat down beside him then, 
feeling sick and helpless. In spite 
of Longan’s care and dying ef- 
fort, in spite of all the scientific 
developments of my own human 
race, I had come too late. Numb- 
ly, I sat and looked down at him 
and wondered why I could not 
have come one day earlier. 

jHROM this half-stuper of self- 
accusation, I was roused 
by Charlie’s attempts to crawl 
back into his hut. My first reac- 
tion was to restrain him. But, 
from somewhere, he seemed to 
have dredged up a remnant of 
his waning strength — and he per- 
sisted. Seeing this, I changed my 
mind and, instead of hindering, 
helped. He dragged himself 
through the entrance, his strength 
visibly waning. 

I did not expect to see him 
emerge. I believed some ancient 
instinct had called him, that he 
would die then and there. But, 
a few moments later, I heard a 
sound as of stones rattling from 
within — and, in a few seconds, 
he began to back out. Halfway 
through the entrance, his strength 
finally failed him. He lay still 
for a minute, then whistled 
weakly. 

I went to him and pulled him 
out the rest of the way. He 
turned his head toward me, hold- 
ing in his mouth what I first took 
to be a ball of dried mud. 



BLACK CHARLIE 



135 



T took it from him and began 

to scrape the mud off with my 
fingernails. Almost immediately, 
the grain and surface of the sand- 
stone he used for his carvings 
began to emerge — and my hands 
started to shake so hard that, for 
a moment, I had to put the stone 
down while I got myself under 
control. For the first time, the 
true importance to Charlie, of 
these things he had chewed and 
bitten into shape, got home to 
me. 

In that moment, I swore that 
whatever bizarre form this last 
and greatest work of his might 
possess, I would make certain 
that it was accorded a place in 
some respectable museum as a 
true work of art. After all, it had 
been conceived in honesty and 
executed in the love that took 
no count of labor, provided the 
end was achieved. 

And then, the rest of the mud 
came free in my hands. I saw 
what it was, and I could have 
cried and laughed at the same 
time. For, of all the shapes he 
could have chosen to work in 
stone, he had picked the one that 
no critic would have selected as 
the choice of an artist of his race. 
For he had chosen no plant or 
animal, no structure or natural 
shape out of his environment, to 
express the hungry longing of his 
spirit. None of these had he 
chosen — instead, with painful 

136 



clumsiness, he had fashioned an 
image from the soft and grainy 
rock; a statue of a standing man. 

And I knew what man it was. 

Charlie lifted his head from 
the stained ground and looked 
toward the lake where my flyer 
waited. I am not an intuitive 
man — but, for once, I was able 
to understand the meaning of a 
look. He wanted me to leave 
while he was still alive. He 
wanted to see me go, carrying the 
thing he had fashioned. I got to 
my feet, holding it and stumbled 
off. At the edge of the clearing, 
I looked back. He still watched. 
And the rest of his people still 
hung back from him. I did not 
think they would bother him 
now. 

And so I came home. 

¥>UT there is one thing more to 
-*-* tell. For a long time, after I 
returned from Elman’s World, I 
did not look at the crude statu- 
ette. I did not want to, for I 
knew that seeing it would only 
confirm what I had known from 
the start, that all the longing and 
desires in the world cannot cre- 
ate art where there is no talent, 
no true visualization. But at the 
end of one year I was cleaning 
up all the little details of my 
office. And, because I believe in 
system and order — and also, be- 
cause I was ashamed of myself 
for having put it off so long — I

took the statuette from a bottom 
drawer of my desk, unwrapped 
it and set it on the desk’s pol- 
ished surface. 

I was alone in my office at the 
time, at the end of a day, when 
the afternoon Sun, striking red 
through the tall window beside 
my desk, touched everything be- 
tween the walls with a clear, 
amber light. I ran my fingers 
over the grainy sandstone and 
held it up to look at it. 

And then — for the first time — 
I saw it, saw through the stone 
to the image beyond, saw what 
Black Charlie had seen, with 
Black Charlie’s eyes, when he 
looked at Longan. I saw men as 
Black Charlie’s kind saw men — 
and I saw what the worlds of men 
meant to Black Charlie. And, 
above all, overriding all, I saw 
art as Black Charlie saw it, 
through his bright alien eyes — 
saw the beauty he had sought at 
the price of his life, and had half- 
found. 

But, most of all, I saw that this 
crude statuette was art. 

One more word. Amid the mud 
and weeds of the swamp, I had 
held the carving in my hands 
and promised myself that this 
work would one day stand on 
display. Following that moment 



of true insight in my office, I did 
my best to place it with the in- 
stitution I represented, then with 
others who knew me as a reput- 
able buyer. 

But I could find no takers. No 
one, although they trusted me 
individually, was willing to ex- 
hibit such a poor-looking piece 
of work on the strength of a his- 
tory that I, alone, could vouch 
for. There are people, close to 
any institution, who are only too 
ready to cry, “Hoax!” For several 
years, I tried without success. 

Eventually, I gave up on the 
true story and sold the statuette, 
along with a number of other 
odd pieces, to a dealer of minor 
reputation, representing it as an 
object whose history I did not 
know. 

Curiously, the statuette has jus- 
tified my belief in what is art, by 
finding a niche for itself. I traced 
it from the dealer, after a time, 
and ran it to Earth quite re- 
cently. There is a highly respect- 
able art gallery on this planet 
which has an extensive display 
of primitive figures of early 
American Indian origin. 

And Black Charlie’s statuette 
is among them. I will not tell 
which or where it is.

Special Delivery 

By DAMON KNIGHT 



All Len had to hear was the old gag: " We've 
never lost a father yet." His child was not 
even born and it was thoroughly unbearable! 



1 EN and Moira Connington 
lived 4n a rented cottage 
j I with a small yard, a small- 
er garden, and too many fir trees. 
The lawn, which Len seldom had 
time to mow, was full of weeds, 
and the garden was overgrown 
with blackberry brambles. The 



house itself was clean and smell- 
ed better than most city apart- 
ments, and Moira kept geraniums 
in the windows. 

However, it was dark on ac- 
count of the firs. Approaching 
the door one late spring after- 
noon, Len tripped on an unno-

ticed flagstone and scattered 
examination papers all the way 
to the porch. 

When he picked himself up, 
Moira was giggling in the door- 
way. “That was funny.” 

“The hell it was,” said Len. “I 
banged my nose.” He picked up 
his Chemistry B papers in a stiff 
silence. A red drop fell on the 
last one. “ Damn it!” 

Moira held the screen door for 
him, looking contrite and faintly 
surprised. She followed him into 
the bathroom. “Len, I didn’t 
mean to laugh. Does it hurt 
much?” 

“No,” said Len, staring fiercely 
at his scraped nose in the mirror. 
It was throbbing like a gong. 

“That’s good. It was the fun- 
niest thing — I mean funny-pecu- 
liar,” she clarified hastily. 

T EN stared at her; the whites 
of her eyes were showing: “Is 
there anything the matter with 
you?” he demanded. 

“I don’t know,” she said on a 
rising note. "Nothing like that 
ever happened to me before. I 
didn’t think it was funny at all. 
I was worried about you, and I 
didn’t know I was going to laugh 
— ” She laughed again, a trifle 
nervously. “Maybe I’m cracking 
up.” 

Moira was a dark-haired 
young woman with a placid, 
friendly disposition. Len had met 



her in his senior year at Colum- 
bia, with — looking at it imparti- 
ally, which Len seldom did — re- 
grettable results. At present, in 
her seventh month, she was shap- 
ed like a rather bosomy kewpie 
doll. 

Emotional upsets, he remem- 
bered, may occur frequently dur- 
ing this period. He leaned to get 
past her- belly and kissed her 
forgivingly. “You’re probably 
tired. Go sit down and I’ll get 
you some coffee.” 

Except that Moira had never 
had any hysterics till now, or 
morning sickness, either — she 
burped instead — and anyhow, 
was there anything in the litera- 
ture about fits of giggling? 

After supper, he marked seven- 
teen sets of papers desultorily in 
red pencil, then got up to look 
for the baby book. There were 
four dog-eared paperbound vol- 
umes with smiling infants’ faces 
on the covers, but the one he 
wanted wasn’t there. He looked 
behind the bookcase and on the 
wicker table beside it. “Moira!” 

“Hm?” 

“Where the devil is the other 
baby book?” 

“I’ve got it.” 

Len went and looked over her 
shoulder. She was staring at a 
drawing of a fetus lying in a sort 
of upside-down Yoga position 
inside a cross-sectioned woman’s 
body. 



140

“That’s what he looks like,” 
she said. “Mama.” 

The diagram was of a fetus 
at term. 

“What was that about your 
mother?” Len asked, puz2led. 

“Don’t be silly,” she said ab- 
stractedly. 

He waited, but she didn’t look 
up or turn the page. After a 
while, he went back to his work. 
He watched her. 

Eventually she leafed through 
to the back of the book, read a 
few pages, and put it down. She 
lighted a cigarette and immedi- 
ately put it out again. She fetch- 
ed up a belch. 

“That was a good one,” said 
Len admiringly. 

Moira sighed. 

Feeling tense, Len picked up 
his coffee cup and started to- 
ward the kitchen. He halted be- 
side Moira’s chair. On the side 
table was her after-dinner cup, 
still full of coffee . black, 
scummed with oil droplets, stone- 
cold. 

“Didn’t you want your cof- 
fee?” he asked solicitously. 

She looked at the cup. “I did, 
but — ” She paused and shook her 
head, looking perplexed. 

“Well, do you want another 
cup now?” 

“Yes, please. No." 

Len, who had begun a step, 
rocked back on his heels. “Which, 
damn it?” 



Her face got all swollen. “Oh, 
Len, I’m so mixed up,” she said, 
and began to tremble. 

Len felt part of his irritation 
spilling over into protectiveness. 
“What you need,” he said firmly, 
“is a drink.” 

TTE climbed a stepladder to get 
at the top cabinet shelf 
which cached their liquor when 
they had any. Small upstate 
towns and their school boards 
being what they were, this was 
one of many necessary financial 
precautions. 

Inspecting the doleful few 
fingers of whisky in the bottle, 
Len swore under his breath. They 
couldn’t afford a decent supply 
of booze or new clothes for Moira. 
The original idea had been for 
Len to teach for a year while 
they saved enough money so 
that he could go back for his 
master’s degree. More lately, this 
proving unlikely, they had 
merely been trying to put aside 
enough for summer school, and 
even that was beginning to look 
like the wildest optimism. 

High-school teachers without 
seniority weren’t supposed to be 
married. 

Or graduate physics students, 
for that matter. 

He mixed two stiff highballs 
and carried them back into the 
living room. “Here you are. 
Skoal.”

"Ah,” she said appreciatively. 
‘‘That tastes — Ugh." She set the 
glass down and stared at it with 
her mouth half open. 

“What’s the matter now?” 

She turned her head carefully, 
as if she were afraid it. would 
come off. “Len, I don’t know. 
Mama." 

“That’s the second time you’ve 
said that. What is this all — ” 

“Said what?” 

“Mama. Look, kid, if you’re — ” 

“I didn’t.” She appeared a little 
feverish. 

“Sure you did,” said Len rea- 
sonably. “Once when you were 
looking at the baby book, and 
then again just now, after you 
said ugh to the highball. Speak- 
ing of which — ” 

“ Mama drink milk" said 
Moira, speaking with exagger- 
ated clarity. 

Moira hated milk. 

Len swallowed half his high- 
ball, turned and went silently 
into the kitchen. 

When he came back with the 
milk, Moira looked at it as if it 
contained a snake. “Len, I didn’t 
say that.” 

“Okay.” 

“I didn’t. I didn’t say mama 
and I didn’t say that about the 
milk.” Her voice quavered. “And 
I didn’t laugh at you when you 
fell down.” 

Len tried to be patient. “It 
was somebody else.” 



“It was.” She looked down at 
her gingham-covered bulge. 
“You won’t believe me. Put 
your hand there. No, a little 
lower.” 

Under the cloth, her flesh was 
warm and solid against his palm. 
“Kicks?” he inquired. 

“Not yet. Now,” she said in a 
strained voice, “you in there — 
if you want your milk, kick three 
times.” 

Len opened his mouth and 
shut it again. Under his hand 
there were three explicit kicks, 
one after the other. 

Moira closed her eyes, held 
her breath and drank the milk 
down in one long horrid gulp. 

“^\NCE in a great while,” 
Moira read, “cell cleavage 
will not have followed the order- 
ly pattern that produces a norm- 
al baby. In these rare cases some 
parts of the body will develop 
excessively, while others do not 
develop at all. This disorderly 
cell growth, which is strikingly 
similar to the wild cell growth 
that we know as cancer — ” Her 
shoulders moved convulsively in 
a shudder. “ Bluh /” 

“Why do you keep reading 
that stuff, if it makes you feel 
that way?” 

“I have to,” she said absently. 
She picked up another book from 
the stack. “There’s a page miss- 
ing.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Len attacked the last of his 
medium-boiled egg in a noncom- 
mittal manner. “It’s a wonder 
it’s held together this long,” he 
said, which was perfectly just. 

The book had had something 
spilled on it, partially dissolving 
the glue, and was in an advanced 
state of anarchy. However, the 
fact was that Len had torn out 
the page in question four nights 
ago, after reading it carefully. 
The topic was ‘‘Psychoses in 
Pregnancy.” 

Moira had now decided that 
the baby was male, that his name 
was Leonardo (not referring to 
Len, but to da Vinci), that he 
had informed her of these things 
along with a good many others, 
that he was keeping her from her 
favorite foods and making her 
eat things she detested, like liver 
and tripe, and that she had to 
read books of his choice all day 
long in order to keep him from 
kicking. 

It was miserably hot. With 
Commencement only two weeks 
away, Len’s students were torpid 
and galvanic by turns. Then 
there was the matter of his con- 
tract for next year, and the pos- 
sible opening at Oster High 
which would mean more money, 
and the Parent- Teachers thing 
tonight at which Superintendent 
Greer and his wife would be re- 
gally present. 

Moira was knee-deep in Vol- 



ume I of Der Untergang des 
Abendlandes, moving her lips; an 
occasional guttural escaped her. 
Len cleared his throat. “Moy?” 
“ — und also des tragischen — 
what in God’s name does he 
mean by that — ? What, Len?” 
He made an irritated noise. 
“Why not try the English edi- 
tion?” 

“Leo wants to learn German. 
What were you going to say?” 
Len closed his eyes for a mo- 
ment. “About this PTA business 
— you sure you want to go?” 
“Well, of course. It’s pretty 
important, isn’t it? Unless you 
think I look too sloppy — ” 

“No. No, damn it! But are you 
feeling up to it?” 

There were faint violet cres- 
cents under Moira’s eyes; she 
had been sleeping badly. “Sure,” 
she said. 

“All right. And you’ll go see 
the doctor tomorrow?” 

“I said I would.” 

“And you won’t say anything 
about Leo to Mrs. Greer or any- 
body?” 

OHE looked slightly embarrass- 
^ ed. “Not till he’s born, I think, 
don’t you? It would be an awful 
hard thing to prove — even you 
wouldn’t have believed me if 
you hadn’t felt him kick.” 

This experiment had not been 
repeated, though Len had asked 
often enough. All little Leo had

wanted, Moira said, was to estab- 
lish communication with his 
mother — he didn’t seem to be in- 
terested in Len at all. “Too 
young,” she explained. 

And still — Len recalled the 
frogs his biology class had dis- 
sected last semester. One of them 
had had two hearts. This disord- 
erly cell growth . like a cancer. 
Unpredictable: extra fingers or 
toes or a double dose of cortex? 

“And I’ll burp like a lady, if at 
all,” Moira assured him cheer- 
fully as they got ready to leave. 

JT^HE room was empty, except 
for the ladies of the Commit- 
tee, two nervously smiling male 
teachers and the impressive bulk 
of Superintendent Greer when the 
Conningtons arrived. Card-table 
legs skreeked on the bare floor; 
the air was heavy with wood pol- 
ish and musk. 

Greer advanced, beaming fix- 
edly. “Well, isn’t this nice? How 
are you young folks this warm 
evening?” 

“Oh, we thought we’d be earl- 
ier, Mr. Greer,” said Moira with 
pretty vexation. She looked sur- 
prisingly schoolgirlish and chic; 
the lump that was Leo was hard- 
ly noticeable unless you caught 
her in profile. “I’ll go right now 
and help the ladies. There must 
be something I can still do.” 

“No, now, we won’t hear of it. 
But I’ll tell you what you can 



do — you can go right over there 
and say hello to Mrs. Greer. I 
know she’s dying to sit down and 
have a good chat with you. Go 
ahead now, don’t worry about 
this husband of yours; I’ll take 
care of him.” 

Moira receded into a scattering 
of small shrieks of pleasure, at 
least half of them arcing across 
a gap of mutual dislike. 

Greer, exhibiting perfect den- 
tures, exhaled Listerine. His pink 
skin looked not only scrubbed 
but disinfected; his gold-rimmed 
glasses belonged in an optome- 
trist’s window, and his tropical 
suit had obviously come straight 
from the cleaner’s. It was impos- 
sible to think of Greer unshaven, 
Greer smoking a cigar, Greer 
with a smudge of axle grease on 
his forehead, or Greer making 
love to his wife. 

“Well, sir, this weather — ” 

“When I think of what this 
valley was like twenty years 
ago — ” 

“At today’s prices — ” 

Len listened with growing ad- 
miration, putting in comments 
where required. He had never 
realized before that there were 
so many absolutely neutral topics 
of conversation. 

A few more people straggled in, 
raising the room temperature 
about half a degree per capita. 
Greer did not perspire; he merely 
glowed. 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



A CROSS the room, Moira was 
**- now seated chummily with 
Mrs. Greer, a large-bosomed wo- 
man in an outrageously unfash- 
ionable hat. Moira appeared to 
be telling a joke; Len knew per- 
fectly well that it was a clean 
one, but he listened tensely, all 
the same, until he heard Mrs. 
Greer yelp with laughter. Her 
voice carried well: “Oh, that’s 
priceless ! Oh, dear, I only hope 
I can remember it!” 

Len had resolutely not been 
thinking of ways to turn the 
conversation toward the Oster 
vacancy. He stiffened again when 
he realized that Greer had 
abruptly begun to talk shop. His 
heart began pounding absurdly; 
Greer was asking highly perti- 
nent questions in a good-humored 
but businesslike way — drawing 
Len out, and not even bothering 
to be the slightest bit Machiavel- 
lian about it. 

Len answered candidly, except 
when he was certain that he knew 
what the Superintendent wanted 
to hear; then he lied like a Tro- 
jan. 

Mrs. Greer had conjured up a 
premature pot of tea and, obliv- 
ious of the stares of the thirsty 
teachers present, she and Moira 
were hogging it, heads together, 
as if they were plotting the over- 
throw of the Republic or ex- 
changing recipes. 

Greer listened attentively to 



Len’s final reply, which was de- 
livered with as pious an air as if 
Len had been a Boy Scout swear- 
ing on the Manual. But since the 
question had been “Do you plan 
to make teaching your career?” 
there was not a word of truth in 
it. 

He then inspected his paunch 
and assumed a mild theatrical 
frown. Len, with that social sixth 
sense which is unmistakable 
when it operates, knew that his 
next words were going to be : 
“You may have heard that Oster 
High will be needing a new 
science teacher next fall . 

At this point Moira made a 
noise like a seal. 

The ensuing silence was broken 
a moment later by a hearty 
scream, followed instantly by a 
clatter and a bone-shaking thud. 

Mrs. Greer was sitting on the 
floor, legs sprawled, hat over her 
eye. She appeared to be attempt- 
ing to perform some sort of ex- 
cessively pagan dance. 

“TT was Leo,” Moira incoher- 
ently told Len at home. 
“You know she’s English — she 
said of course a cup of tea 
wouldn’t hurt me, and she in- 
sisted I go ahead and drink it 
while it was hot, and I 
couldn’t — ” 

“No, no— wait,” said Len in a 
controlled fury. “What — ” 

“So I drank some. And Leo

kicked up and made me burp the 
burp I was saving. And — ” 

“Oh, Lord!” 

“ — then he kicked the teacup 
out of my hand into her lap, and 
I wish I was dead!” 

On the following day, Len took 
Moira to the doctor’s office, 
where they read dog-eared copies 
of The Rotarian and Field and 
Stream for an hour. 

Dr. Berry was a round little 
man with soulful eyes and a 
twenty-four-hour bedside man- 
ner. On the walls of his office, 
where it is customary for doc- 
tors to hang all sorts of diplomas 
and certificates of membership, 
Berry had only three. The rest of 
the space was filled with enlarged 
colored photographs of beautiful, 
beautiful children. 

When Len followed Moira de- 
terminedly into the consulting 
room, Berry looked mildly 
shocked for a moment, then ap- 
parently decided to carry on as 
if nothing outre had happened. 
You could not say that he spoke, 
or even whispered; he rustled. 

“Now, Mrs. Connington, we’re 
looking just fine today. How 
have we been feeling?” 

“Just fine. My husband thinks 
I’m insane.” 

“That’s g — Well, that’s a fun- 
ny thing for him to think, isn’t 
it?” Berry glanced at the wall 
midway between himself and 
Len, then shuffled some file cards

rather nervously. “Now. Bave we 
had any soreness in our stom- 
ach?” 

“Yes. He’s been kicking me 
black and blue.” 

Berry misinterpreted Moira’s 
brooding glance at Len, and his 
eyebrows twitched involuntarily. 

“The baby,” said Len. “The 
baby kicks her.” 

Berry coughed. “Any head- 
aches? Dizziness? Vomiting? 
Swelling in our legs or ankles?” 
“No.” 

“All rightie. Now let’s just find 
out how much we’ve gained, and 
then we’ll get up on the exam- 
ination table.” 

Berry drew the sheet down 
over Moira’s abdomen as if it 
were an exceptionally fragile egg. 
He probed delicately with his fat 
fingertips, then used the stetho- 
scope. 

“Those X-rays,” said Len. 
“Have they come back yet?” 
“Mm-hm,” said Berry. “Yes, 
they have.” He moved the stetho- 
scope and listened again. 

“Did they show anything un- 
usual?” Len asked. 

¥>ERRY’S eyebrows twitched a 
polite question. 

“We’ve been having a little 
argument,” Moira said in a 
strained voice, “about whether 
this is an ordinary baby or not.” 
Berry took the stethoscooe 
tubes away from his ears. He 



gazed at Moira like an anxious 
spaniel. 

“Now let’s not worry about 
that. We’re going to have a per- 
fectly healthy wonderful baby, 
and if anybody tells us different- 
ly, why, we’ll just tell them to go 
jump in the lake, won’t we?” 

“The baby is absolutely nor- 
mal?” Len said in a marked man- 
ner. 

“Absolutely.” Berry applied 
the stethoscope again. His face 
blanched. 

“What’s the matter?” Len ask- 
ed after a moment. 

The doctor’s gaze was fixed 
and glassy. 

“Vagitus uterinus,” Berry mut- 
tered. He pulled the stethoscope 
off abruptly and stared at it. 
“No. of course it couldn’t be. 
Now isn’t that a nuisance? We 
seem to be picking up a radio 
broadcast with our little stetho- 
scope here. I’ll just go and get 
another instrument.” 

Moira and Len exchanged 
glances. Moira’s was almost ex- 
cessively bland. 

Berry confidently came in with 
a new stethoscope, put the dia- 
phragm against Moira’s belly, 
listened for an instant and twitch- 
ed once all over, as if his main- 
spring had snapped. Visibly 
jangling, he stepped away from 
the table. His jaw worked sever- 
al times before any sound came 
out. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Excuse me,” he said, and 
walked out in an uneven line. 

Len snatched up the instru- 
ment he had dropped. 

Like a bell ringing under water, 
muffled but clear, a tiny voice 
was shouting: “ You bladder- 

headed pill pusher! You bedside 
vacuum! You fifth-rate tree sur- 
geon! You inflated — ’’ A pause. 
“Is that you, Connington? Get 
off the line; I haven't finished 
with Dr. Bedpan yet.” 

Moira smiled, like a Buddha- 
shaped bomb. 

“Well?” she said. 

“ VvZE’VE got to think,” Len 
kept saying over and over. 
“You’ve got to think.” Moira 
was combing her hair, snapping 
the comb smartly at the end of 
each stroke. “I’ve had plenty of 
time to think, ever since it hap- 
pened. When you catch up — ” 
Len flung his tie at the carved 
wooden pineapple on the comer 
of the footboard. “Moy, be rea- 
sonable. The chances against the 
kid kicking three times in any 
one- minute period are only about 
one in a hundred. The chances 
against anything like — ” 

Moira grunted and stiffened for 
a moment. Then she cocked her 
head to one side with a listening 
expression ... a new mannerism 
of hers that was beginning to 
send intangible snakes crawling 
up Len’s spine. 



“What now?” he asked sharply. 

“He says to keep our voices 
down. He’s thinking.” 

Len’s fingers clenched convul- 
sively, and a button flew off his 
shirt. Shaking, he pulled his arms 
out of the sleeves and dropped 
the shirt on the floor. “Look. I 
just want to get this straight. 
When he talks to you, you don’t 
hear him shouting all the way 
up past your liver and lights. 
What—” 

“You know perfectly well he 
reads my mind.” 

“That isn’t the same as — ” Len 
took a deep breath. “Let’s not get 
off on that. What I want to know 

is, what is it like? Do you seem 
to hear a real voice, or do you 
just know what he’s telling you, 
without knowing how you 
know?” 

Moira put the comb down in 
order to think better. “It isn’t 
like hearing a voice. You’d never 
confuse one with the other. It’s 
more — the nearest I can come to 

it, it’s like remembering a voice. 
Except that you don’t know 
what’s coming.” 

Len picked his tie off the floor 
and abstractedly began knotting 
it on his bare chest. “And he sees 
what you see, he knows what 
you’re thinking, he can hear when 
people talk to you?” 

“Of course.” 

“This is tremendous!” Len be- 
gan to blunder around the bed-

room, not looking where he was 
going. “They thought Macaulay 
was a genius. This kid isn’t even 
born. I heard him. He was cuss- 
ing Berry out like Monty Wool- 
ley.” 

“He had me reading The Man 
Who Came to Dinner two days 
ago.” 

Len made his way around a 
small bedside table by trial and 
er^pr. “That’s another thing. How 
much could you say about his — 
his personality? I mean does he 
seem to know what he’s doing, or 
is he just striking out wildly in 
all directions?” He paused. “Are 
you sure he’s really conscious at 
all?” 

1%/JOIRA began, “That’s a silly 
— ” and stopped. “Define 
consciousness,” she said doubt- 
fully. 

“All right, what I really mean 
— why am I wearing this neck- 
tie?” He ripped it off and threw 
it over a lampshade. “What I 
mean — ” 

“Are you sure you’re really 
conscious?” 

“Okay. You make joke, I 
laugh, ha-ha. What I’m trying to 
ask is, have you seen any evi- 
dence of creative thought, organ- 
ized thought, or is he just 
— integrating, along the lines of 
— of instinctive responses? Do 
you — ” 

“I know what you mean. Shut 



up a minute. I don’t know.” 
“I mean is he awake, or asleep 
and dreaming about us, like the 
Red King?” 

“I don’t know!" 

“And if that’s it, what’ll hap- 
pen when he wakes up?” 

Moira took off her robe, folded 
it neatly, and maneuvered her- 
self between the sheets. “Come to 
bed.” 

Len got one sock off before 
another thought struck him. “He 
reads your mind. Can he read 
other people’s?” He looked ap- 
palled. “Can he read mine?” 
“He doesn’t. Whether it’s be- 
cause he can’t, I don’t know. I 
think he just doesn’t care.” 

Len pulled the other sock half- 
way down and left it there. In a 
stiffer tone, he said, “One of the 
things he doesn’t care about is 
whether I have a job.” 

“No. He thought it was funny. 
I wanted to sink through the 
floor, but I had all I could do to 
keep from laughing when she 
fell down . Len, what are we 
going to do?” 

He swiveled around and look- 
ed at her. 

“Look,” he said, “I didn’t 
mean to sound that gloomy. 
We’ll do something. We’ll fix it. 
Really.” 

“I hope so.” 

Careful of his elbows and 
knees, Len climbed into the bed 
beside her. “Okay now?”

"Mm . .Ugh.” Moira tried to 
sit up suddenly, and almost made 
it. She wound up propped on 
one elbow, and said indignantly, 
"Oh, no!” 

Len stared at her in the dim- 
ness. ‘“What — ?” , 

She grunted again. "Len, get 
up. All right. Len, hurry!" 

Len fought his way convulsive- 
ly past a treacherous sheet and 
staggered up, goose-pimpled and 
tense. “What’s wrong?” 

"You’ll have to sleep on the 
couch. The sheets are in the bot- 
tom — ” 

“On that couch? Are you 
crazy?” 

“I can’t help it,” she said in a 
small faint voice. "Please don’t 
let’s argue. You’ll just have to.” 

"Why?" 

“We can’t sleep in the same 
bed,” she wailed. "He says it’s — 
oh ! — unhygienic !” 

¥ EN’S contract was not renew- 
ed. He get a job waiting on 
tables in a resort hotel, an oc- 
cupation which pays more money 
than teaching future citizens the 
rudiments of three basic sciences, 
but for which Len had no apti- 
tude. He lasted three days at it; 
he was then idle for a week and 
a half until his four years of col- 
lege physics earned him employ- 
ment as a clerk in an electrical 
shop. His employer was a cheer- 
fully aggressive man who assured 



Len that there were great oppor- 
tunities in radio and television, 
and firmly believed that atom- 
bomb tests were causing all the 
bad weather. 

Moira, in her eighth month, 
walked to the county library 
every day and trundled a load of 
books home in the perambulator. 
Little Leo, it appeared, was 
working his way simultaneously 
through biology, astrophysics, 
phrenology, chemical engineer- 
ing, architecture, Christian 
Science, psychosomatic medicine, 
marine law, business manage- 
ment, Yoga, crystallography, met- 
aphysics and modern literature. 

His domination of Moira’s life 
remained absolute, and his ex- 
periments with her regimen con- 
tinued. One week, she ate nothing 
but nuts and fruit, washed down 
with distilled water; the next, she 
was on a diet of porterhouse 
steak, dandelion greens and Had- 
acol. 

With the coming of full sum- 
mer, fortunately, few of the high 
school staff were in evidence. Len 
met Dr. Berry once on the street. 
Berry started, twitched, and 
walked off rapidly in an entirely 
new direction. 

The diabolical event was due 
on or about July 29th. Len cross- 
ed off each day on their wall 
calendar with an emphatic black 
grease pencil. It would, he sup- 
posed, be an uncomfortable thing

at best to be the parent of a 
super-prodigy. Leo would no 
doubt be dictator of the world by 
the time he was fifteen, unless he 
would be assassinated first, but 
almost anything would be a fair 
price for getting Leo out of his 
maternal fortress. 

Then there was the day when 
Len came home to find Moira 
weeping over the typewriter, with 
a half-inch stack of manuscript 
beside her. 

“It isn’t anything. Fm just 
tired. He started this after lunch. 
Look.” 

Len turned the face-down 
sheaf the right way up. 

Droning. Abrasing 
the demiurge. 

Hier begrimms the tale: 

Eyes undotted, grewling 
and looking, turns off 
a larni, seizes does. 

Stewed Bierly a wretch 
Pence, therefore tchews we. Pons! 
Let the pants take air of them- 
snlves. 

fTiHE first three sheets were all 
like that. The fourth was a 
perfectly good Petrarchian son- 
net reviling the current adminis- 
tration and the political party of 
which Len was a* registration-day 
member. 

The fifth was hand-lettered in 
the Cyrillic alphabet and illus- 
trated with geometric diagrams. 
Len put it down and stared shak- 
ily at Moira. 



“No, go on,” she said, “read 
the rest.” 

The sixth and seventh were 
obscene limericks; and the 
eighth, ninth and so on to the 
end of the stack were what look- 
ed like the first chapters of a 
rattling good historical adven- 
ture novel. 

Its chief characters were Cyrus 
the Great, his jaiinty-bosomed 
daughter Lygea, of whom Len 
had never previously heard, and 
a one-armed Graeco-Mede ad- 
venturer named Xanthes. There 
were also courtesans, spies, ap- 
paritions, scullery slaves, oracles, 
cutthroats, lepers, priests and 
men-at-arms in magnificent pro- 
fusion. r 

“He’s decided,” said Moira, 
“what he wants to be when he’s 
bom.” 

Leo refused to bothered with 
mundane details. When there 
were eighty pages of the manu- 
script, it was. Moira who invent- 
ed a title and by-line for it — The 
Virgin of Persepolis by Leon 
Lenn — and mailed it off to a lit- 
erary agent in New York. His 
response, a week later, was cau- 
tiously enthusiastic. He asked for 
an outline of the remainder of 
the novel. 

Moira replied that this was im- 
possible, trying to sound as un- 
worldly and impenetrably artistic 
as she could. She enclosed the 
thirty-odd pages Leo had turned

out through her in the meantime. 

Nothing was heard from the 
agent for two weeks. At the end 
of this time, Moira received an 
astonishing document, exquisitely 
printed and bound in imitation 
leather, thirty-two pages includ- 
ing the index, containing three 
times as many clauses as a lease. 

This turned out to be a book 
contract. With it came the agent’s 
check for nine hundred dollars. 

T EN tilted his mop-ttandle 
against the wall and straight- 
ened carefully, conscious of every 
individual gritty muscle in his 
back. How did women do house- 
work every day, seven days a 
week, fifty-two goddam weeks a 
year? 

It was a little cooler now that 
the Sun was down, and he was 
working stripped to shorts and 
bath slippers; but he might as 
well have been wearing an over- 
coat in a Turkish bath. 

The faint whisper of Moira’s 
monstrous new electrical type- 
writer stopped, leaving a fainter 
hum. Len went into the living 
room and sagged on the arm of 
a chair. Moira, gleaming sweatily 
in a flowered housecoat, was 
lighting a cigarette. 

“How’s it going?” he asked, 
hoping for an answer. He hadn’t 
always received one. 

She switched off the machine 
wearily. “Page two-eighty-nine. 



Xanthes killed Anaxander.” 
“Thought he would. How 
about Ganesh and Zeuxias?” 

“I don’t know.” She frowned. 
“I can’t figure it out. You know 
who it was that raped Marianne 
in the garden?” 

“No, who?” 

“Ganesh.” 

“You’re kidding!” 

“Nope.” She pointed to the 
stack of typescript. “See for 
yourself.” 

Len didn't move. “But Ganesh 
was in Lydia, buying back the 
sapphire. He didn’t return till — ” 
“I know, I know. But he 
wasn’t. That was Zeuxias in a 
putty nose with his beard dyed. 
It’s all perfectly logical, the way 
Leo explains it. Zeuxias over- 
heard Ganesh talking to the three 
Mongols — you remember, Gan- 
esh thought there was somebody 
behind the curtain, only that was 
when they heard Lygea scream, 
and while their backs were turn- 
ed — ” 

“All right. But for God’s sake, 
this fouls everything up. If Gan- 
esh never went to Lydia, then he 
couldn’t have had anything to do 
distempering Cyrus’s armor. Apd 
Zeuxias couldn’t, either, be- 
cause — ” 

“It’s exasperating. I know he’s 
going to pull another rabbit out 
of the hat and clear everything 
up, but I don’t see how.” 

Len brooded. “It beats me. It

had to be either Ganesh or Zeux- 
ias. Or Philomenes, though that 
doesn’t seem possible. Look, 
damn it, if Zeuxias knew about 
the sapphire all the time, that 
rules out Philomenes once and 
for all. Unless — no. I forgot 
about that business in the temple. 
Umm. Do you think Leo really 
knows what he’s doing?” 

“I’m certain. Lately I’ve been 
able to tell what he’s thinking 
even when he isn’t talking to me. 
I mean just generally, like when 
he’s puzzling over something, or 
when he’s feeling mean. It’s go- 
ing to be something brilliant and 
he knows what it is, but he won’t 
tell me. We’ll just have to wait.” 
“I guess so.” Len stood up, 
grunting. “You want me to see 
if there’s anything in the pot?” 
“Please.” 

Len wandered into the kitchen, 
turned the flame on under the 
silex, stared briefly at the dishes 
waiting in the sink, and wander- 
ed out again. Since the onslaught 
of The Novel, Leo had relin- 
quished his interest in Moira’s 
diet, and she had been living on 
coffee. Small blessings . 

lV/JOIRA was leaning back with 
her eyes closed, looking very 
tired. “How’s the money?” she 
asked without moving. 

“Lousy. We’re down to twen- 
ty-one bucks.” 

She raised her head and open- 



ed her eyes wide. “We couldn’t 
be! Len, how could anybody go 
through nine hundred dollars that 
fast?” 

“Typewriter. And the dicta- 
phone that Leo thought he want- 
ed, till about half an hour after 
it was paid for. We spent less 
than fifty on ourselves, I think. 
Rent. Groceries. It goes, when 
there isn’t any coming in.” 

She sighed. “I thought it would 
last longer.” 

“So did I. If he doesn’t finish 
this thing in a few days, I’ll have 
to go look for work again.” 

“Oh. That isn’t so good. How 
am I going to take care of the 
house and do Leo’s writing for 
him?” 

“I know, but — ■” 

“All right. If it works out, fine. 
If it doesn’t — he must be near 
the end by now.” She stubbed out 
her cigarette abruptly and sat 
up, hands over the keyboard. 
“He’s getting ready again. See 
about that coffee, will you? I’m 
half dead.” 

Len poured two cups and car- 
ried them in. Moira was still 
sitting poised in front of the 
typewriter, with a curious half- 
formed expression on her face. 

Abruptly the carriage whipped 
over, muttered to itself briefly 
and thumped the paper up twice. 
Then it stopped. Moira’s eyes got 
bigger and rounder. 

“What’s the matter?” said Len.

He looked over her shoulder. 

The last line on the page read : 

TO BE CONTINUED IN OUR NEXT 

Moira’s hands curled into 
small helpless fists. After a mo- 
ment. she turned off the machine. 

“What?” said Len incredu- 
lously. “To be continued — what 
kind of talk is that?” 

“He says he’s bored with the 
novel,” Moira replied dully. “He 
says he knows the ending, so it’s 
artistically complete ; it doesn’t 
matter whether anybody else 
thinks so or not.” She paused. 
“But he says that isn’t the real 
reason.” 

“Well?” 

“He’s got two reasons. One is 
that he doesn’t want to finish the 
book till he’s certain he’ll have 
complete control of the money 
it earns.” 

“Yes,” said Len, swallowing a 
lump of anger, “that makes a 
certain amount of sense. It’s his 
book. If he wants guarantees. .” 

“You haven’t heard the other 
one.” 

“All right, let's have it.” 

“He wants to teach us — so 
we’ll never forget — who the boss 
is in this family.” 

“T EN, I’m awfully tired,” 
Moira complained piteous- 
ly, late that night. 

“Let’s just go over it once 



more. There has to be some way. 
He still isn’t talking to you?” 

“I haven’t felt anything from 
him for the last twenty minutes. 
I think he’s asleep.” 

“All right, let’s suppose he 
isn’t going to listen to reason — ” 
“I think we’d better.” 

Len made an incoherent noise. 
“Well, okay. I still don’t see why 
we can’t write the last chapter 
ourselves. It’d only ‘ be a few 
pages.” 

“Go ahead and try.” 

“Not me. You’ve done a little 
writing. Damned good, too. And 
if you’re so sure all the clues are 
there — Look, if you say you can’t 
do it, all right, we’ll hire some- 
body. A professional writer. It 
happens all the time. Thome 
Smith’s last novel — ” 

“It wasn’t Thome Smith's and 
it wasn’t a novel,” she said dog- 
matically. 

“But it sold. What one writer 
starts, another can finish.” 

“Nobody ever finished The 
Mystery of Edwin Drood .” 

“Oh, hell.” 

“Len, it’s impossible. It is l Let 
me finish — if you’re thinking we 
could have somebody rewrite the 
last part Leo did — ” 

“Yeah, I just thought of that.” 
“ — even that wouldn’t do any 
good. You’d have to go all the 
way back, almost to page one. 
It would be another story when 
you got through. Let’s go to bed.”

“Moy, do you remember when 
we used to worry about the law 
of opposites?” 

“Mm?” 

“The law of opposites. When 
we used to be afraid the kid 
would turn out to be a pick-and- 
shovel man with a pointy head.” 
“Uh. Mm.” 

He turned. Moira was standing 
with one hand on her belly and 
the other behind her back. She 
looked as if she were about to 
start practicing a low bow and 
doubted she could make it. 

“What’s the matter now?” he 
asked. 

“Pain in the small of my 
back.” 

“Bad one?” 

“No . .” 

“Belly hurt, too?” 

She frowned. “Don’t be fool- 
ish. I’m feeling for the contrac- 
tion. There it comes.” 

“The — but you just said the 
small of your back.” 

“Where do you think labor 
pains usually start?” 

HTHE pains were coming at 
twenty-minute intervals and 
the taxi had not arrived. Moira 
was packed and ready. Len was 
trying to set her a good example 
by remaining calm. He strolled 
over to the wall calendar, gazed 
at it in an offhand manner, and 
turned away. 

“Len, I know it’s only the 



fifteenth of July,” she said im- 
patiently. 

"Huh? I didn’t say anything 
about that.” 

“You said it seven times. Sit 
down. You’re making me ner- 
vous.” 

Len perched on the comer of 
the table, folded his arms, and 
immediately got up to look out 
the window. On the way back, he 
circled the table in an aimless 
way, picked up a bottle of ink 
and shook it to see if the cap 
was on tight, stumbled over a 
wastebasket, carefully up-ended 
it, and sat down with an air of 
Id je suis, id je reste. 

“Nothing to worry about,” he 
said firmly. “Women have kids 
all the time.” 

“True.” 

“What for?” he demanded vio- 
lently. 

Moira grinned at him, then 
winced slightly and looked at the 
clock. “Eighteen minutes this 
time. They’re getting closer.” 

When she relaxed, Len put a 
cigarette in his mouth and light- 
ed it in only two tries. “How’s 
Leo taking it?” 

“Isn’t saying. He feels — ” she 
concentrated — “apprehensive. He 
tells me he’s feeling strange and 
he doesn’t like it. I don’t think 
he’s entirely awake. Funny — ” 

“I’m glad this is happening 
now,” Len announced. 

“So am I, but — •”

“Look,” said Len, moving en- 
ergetically to the arm of her 
chair. “We’ve always had it 
pretty good, haven’t we? Not 
that it hasn’t been tough at times, 
but — you know.” 

“I know.” 

“Well, that’s the way it’ll be 
again, once this is over. I don’t 
care how much of a superbrain he 
is, once he’s bom — you know 
what I mean? The only reason 
he’s had the edge on us all this 
time is he could get at us and we 
couldn’t get at him. If he’s got 
the mind of an adult, he can 
learn to act like one. It’s that 
simple.” 

Moira hesitated. “You can’t 
take him out to the woodshed. 
He's going to be a helpless baby, 
physically, like anybody else’s. 
He has to be ta&en care of.” 

“All right, there are plenty of 
other ways. If he behaves, he 
gets read to. Things like that.” 
“That’s right, but there’s one 
other thing I thought of. You re- 
member when you said suppose 
he’s asleep and dreaming, and 
what happens if he wakes up?” 
“Yeah.” 

“That reminded me of some- 
thing else, or maybe it’s the same 
thing. Did you know that a fetus 
in the womb only gets about half 
the amount of oxygen in his 
blood that he’ll have when he 
starts to breathe?” 

Len looked thoughtful. “I for- 



got. Well, that’s just one more 
thing Leo does that babies aren’t 
supposed to do.” 

"Use as much energy as he 
does, you mean. What I’m get- 
ting at is, it can’t be because he’s 
getting more than the normal 
amount of oxygen, can it? I mean 
he’s the prodigy, not me. He 
must be using it more efficiently. 
And if that’s it, what will happen 
when he gets twice as much?” 

r I '’HEY had prepared and dis- 
infected her, along with other 
indignities, and now she could 
see herself in the reflector of the 
big delivery-table light — the 
image clear and bright, like ev- 
erything else, but very haloed 
and swimmy, and looking like a 
bad statue of Sita. She had no 
idea how long she had been here 
— that was the dope, probably — 
but she was getting pretty tired. 

“Bear down,” said the staff 
doctor kindly, and before she 
could answer, the pain came up 
like violins and she had to gulp 
at the tingly coldness of laughing 
gas. 

When the mask lifted, she said, 
“I am bearing down,” but the 
doctor had gone back to work 
and wasn’t listening. 

Anyhow, she had Leo. How are 
you feeling? 

His answer was muddled — be- 
cause of the anesthetic? — but she 
didn’t really need it. Her percep-

tion of him was clear: darkness 
and pressure, impatience, a slow 
Satanic anger . and something 
else. Uncertainty? Dread? 

“Two or three more ought to 
do it. Bear down/’ 

Fear. Unmistakable now. And 
a desperate determination — 

“Doctor, he doesn’t want to be 
born!” 

“Seems that way sometimes, 
doesn’t it? Now bear down good 
and hard.” 

Tell him stop blurrrr too dan- 
gerrrr stop I feel worm stop I 
teUrrrr stop 

“What, Leo? What?” 

“Bear down,” the doctor said 
abstractedly. 

Faintly, like a voice under 
water, gasping before it drowns: 
Hurry I hate you tell him sealed 
incubator tenth oxygen nine- 
tenths inert gases hurry hurry 
hurry 

“An incubator!” she panted. 
“He’ll need an incubator ... to 
live . won’t he?” 

“Not this baby. A fine, normal, 
healthy one.” 

He’s idiot lying stupid fool 
need incubator tenth oxygen 
tenth tenth hurry before it's 

The pressure abruptly ceased. 

Leo was born. 

The doctor was holding him up 
by the heels, red, wrinkled, puny. 
But the voice was still there, 
very small, very far away: Too 
late same as death 



Then a hint of the old cold 
arrogance: Now you'll never 

know who killed Cyrus. 

The doctor slapped him smart- 
ly on the minuscule behind. The 
wizened, malevolent face writh- 
ed open, but it was only the 
angry squall of an ordinary in- 
fant that came out. 

Leo was gone, like a light turn- 
ed off beneath the measureless 
ocean. 

Moira raised her head weakly. 

“Give him one for me,” she 
said.

“My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become 
emaciated. - - - The moon gazed on my midnight labors, while - - - I 
pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my 
secret toil - - - — From “Frankenstein" 

Mary Shelley’s fictional character, Victor Frankenstein, labored with 
fevered and sleepless brain to create his fearful artificial Being. We who 
have read and enjoyed this story have, of course, accepted it for what it is, 
a fantastic and impossible tale. 

But is it possible that a large machine may be built that, duplicating 
all the most basic functions of the brain, would be able (though not a live 
thing) to think and solve problems exactly as a human brain docs, and to 
have all mental situations a human mind has? "All Mind Functions" is a 
book that expounds a certain entirely new, radical, all-encompassing hypothesis 
of simple postulates to fully explain the entire mind, its extreme basics, 
and every function of it. All mind situations fit into this hypothesis easily 
and naturally including emotions, feelings, morals and inhibitions, neuroses, 
semi -neuroses, psychosomatic illnesses, criminality, will, memory, composition 
of thought itself, reasoning, the entire formation of each personality, all 
traits of character, how persons of certain physical types acquire certain 
mental traits, and all else. 

Here are quotations from the latter part of "All Mind Functions*': 

A machine may be constructed (to follow the basic postulates previously 
described tn this book) that would duplicate basic functions of the human 

mind. - - - It could be made more intelligent than onv man. It rcould 

be humanoid in function. - - - Creation of (these) - - - could mean the end
