Three Great IP Game/: 

Serious science-fiction comes to life in these three fas- 
cinating simulation games from SPI. All three games use the 
same, completely original “universe” as their background. 




StarForce: 



The original, master game 
of the series. Starships 
flash across the light-years 
to do combat on an accur- 
ate star map representing 
a sphere of space 40 
light-years in diameter. 
The most popular space 
war simulation available. 




StarSoldier: 



Individual StarSoldiers 
struggle for control of the 
planetary surfaces. Using 
exotic, futuristic weapon- 
systems, highly mobile 
human, alien, and android 
soldiers clash in this excit- 
ing, multi-scenario por- 
trayal of 25th century 
tactics. $9.00 




Outreach: 

Sister game to StarForce 
set on a truly grand gal- 
actic scale. Map depicts 
one-third of our galaxy. 
Each game turn represents 
a hundred years. Game 
involves exploration and 
exploitation of thousand 
light-year volumes of 
space. $9.00 



$8.00 

StarForce Trilogy: All Three Games in One Package! 

You can get a great bargain by purchasing all three games in one box for only $16.95 — a 
savings of more than $9 over the separately boxed versions. 

The physical components of the games are basically similar: a 22 x 34 inch multi-colored game map 
printed on heavy card stock; 200 to 400 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; an S'/a x It rules booklet and a 
compartmented plastic box.

RESCUE ROOM 












Billion-dollar research projects don’t 
make many political friends under the 
best conditions. And when disaster 
strikes 



Like a grim fortress outpost of 
the Foreign Legion, NASA An- 
timatter Research Station One swel- 
tered under the relentless sun of the 
Mojave Desert. 

After four years Jean Pelham 
Ringefield, assistant director of the 
Fast Room project, could still shiver 
in awe at the terrible beckoning 
vastness. 

Bernard Ringefield, the project di- 
rector, looked at it in a more pro- 
saic manner. It wasn’t bad enough, 
he insisted, that a single mistake 
could tum the station into drifting 
atoms; no, the government had 
made that eventual error inevitable 
by plunking them down into the 
most irritating environment imagin- 
able. 

In the office of the station super- 
visor, Ronald Ferrier, sunlight like 
golden, pressure-steam blasted in 
through the polarized window to 
burnish the two occupants. 

“You’ve heard of the latest fiscal 
squeeze, haven’t you, Jean?” asked 
Ferrier from his seat. “NASA is 
being cracked down upon: first, as a 
matter of standing Congressional 
policy; and second, as a result of 

RESCUE ROOM 



the Orbital Station disaster.” 

Turning from the desert 
panorama, Jean Pelham pushed her 
long, dark hair back from her eyes. 
“And our station being even more 
dangerous, we’re first on the list of 
shutdowns. Right?” 

His desk model of the heavy-duty 
matter-antimatter reactor sheltered 
Ronald Ferrier from her question. 
He continued offhandedly. “Senator 
Stoughton is coming out to look us 
over. I want to give him an impres- 
sive show. Your full-scale Fast 
Room is about to be sent out on its 
first piloted run, isn’t it?” 

“We haven’t our requisition of 
antimatter yet. And it’s certainly not 
a spectabular show. The other proj- 
ects are much flashier.” 

“The ‘flashy’ ones are all tied up 
in one way or another; none is 
available for any sort of demonstra- 
tion. The other teams will sacrifice 
their priority on the antimatter in 
this common crisis.” 

The young physicist shrugged, 
matching Ferrier’s overdone casual- 
ness. “A multimillion-dollar-gob- 
bling exhibitions isn’t the best evi- 
dence of economy.” 

7 




“Nevertheless, Congress must be 
convinced of our material progress. 
They’ll be here on the fifteenth.” 
Jean’s voice finally rose. 
“Ronald, we’re not properly pre- 
pared. I’ve budgeted every minute 
of that time before the requisition 
date. We are simply not ready." 

“Doctor Pelham, you’ll simply 
have to be ready. There is no 
other — ” Ferrier’s voice cracked 
and expired in an embarrassed peep. 
Squirming in the scalding sunlight, 
he muttered, “What can I say? Be- 
lieve me, I see your point. I sym- 
pathize completely, but. ...” 

Her hair fell forward again, hid- 
ing her face from him as she cross- 
ed to the desk and pretended to 
examine the reactor model. 

“I’m sorry, Ronald. You’re 
under more pressure than anyone in 
this. .this. .in what Bernard 
calls a four-walled doomsday 
bomb.” 

The supervisor dropped his gaze 
to regard the massive miniature. 
“How is Bernard doing now?” he 
asked softly. 

“Quite well, the doctor says. 
Waiting to return to the project. 
He’ll insist on coming back now.” 
“Under this extra stress? He’ll 
fall right into another breakdown.” 
Jean’s attention had returned to 
the desert and its sky tinted brown 
by the window filter. A transport 
rocket lolled down a final cushion 
of flame onto the airstrip-pad a mile 
distant, bearing a few more precious 
kilos of anti-iron from Canaveral. 

“The Fast Room is his life, 
Ronald. He’ll die if he has to stay 
away.” 

Looking up, Ferrier spied the 
movement of her hand. But this 

8 



time, he thought, she was brushing 
away more than the stray strands of 
hair. 

★ ★ ★ 

A week and a half later, in the 
late morning of the fifteenth, Jean 
Pelham stood with her husband on 
the observation balcony of Experi- 
ment Chamber C. In the sunshine 
from the polarized skylight Bernard 
Ringefield’s hospital pallor lingered 
yet. 

“I’d better go down there,” he 
said. 

“They’ll do fine, darling.” 
Jean’s grip was soft but firm on his 
arm. 

Fifteen feet below, a tractor- lift 
trundled the fragile-looking Fast 
Room in through the chamber’s 
huge double doors. Seven solemn 
technicians stood ready to take it 
over from the tractor crew. One 
young woman, unable to wait, ran 
to meet it; the others scrambled 
after her, their reserve broken, 
laughing with satisfaction. 

To the coming delegation, Jean 
knew, the Room would appear 
crude, unfinished. To her, its 
starkly functional lines held their 
own sort of pristine beauty. It had 
been stripped down for the lowest 
mass possible. It was a round, 
seven-foot-wide metal-mesh plat- 
form on four stubby legs; from its 
center a thin column rose five feet 
high to terminate in a raggle-taggle 
sphere of cryoelectronic breadboards 
and thick wiring. Cables snaked 
down the column to a small 
matter-antimatter reactor. The reac- 
tor and its accompanying equipment 
took up half the platform. 



GALAXY 




As Jean urged Bernard back from 
the railing, the cheerful southwest- 
ern twang of Don Wood’s voice re- 
sounded in the corridor outside. The 
ruddy astronaut strolled onto the 
balcony and leaned over danger- 
ously far to inspect the Room. 

“Guess I’ll mosey down and 
commence flight check, Doc,” he 
said, reaching up to clap Ringefield 
on the back. “By the way, the 
Senators are here.” 

“The sooner we start, the sooner 
we’ll finish,” said Jean. 

Bernard grimaced. “Not soon 
enough for me.” 

She managed to halfway straight- 
en his tie before he stalked out. 
After a quick observation of her 
crew’s progress, she hurried after 
him. 

He was waiting at the elevator. 
“Bernard, let’s take the stairs.” 

“Oh. Sorry.” 

Jean had to half-run to keep pace 
with his Ichabod strides. Bernard’s 
right hand strayed to his wedding 
band, compulsively twisting the 
slim ring. 

In Bernard’s office Ferrier was 
waiting with the three Senators — 
Andrew Stoughton and his gray- 
faced junior colleagues. The super- 
visor introduced them and then re- 
treated to his administrative domain. 

To her dismay, Jean saw Bernard 
immediately begin to head toward 
disaster. 

“Well, gentlemen,” he said, 
“let’s get down to it, shall we? 
We’re here to entertain you. Pick a 
card.” 

“Cut the crap,” Senator Stough- 
ton growled around his cigar. 

“All right, Senator.” Ringefield 
took a deep breath, then suddenly 



sighed as if crucified. “Here, then, 
the prototype Fast Room.” He 
wrenched open a cabinet and with- 
drew an imperfect one-foot metal 
spheroid. 

“This weighs nine kilos, includ- 
ing five kilos of fuel. Equal parts of 
iron and anti-iron.” The two silent 
Senators flinched, more ashen than 
ever. “That’s right, boys, the equiv- 
alent of five tons of fissionable 
material.” 

“Where the hell is the shield- 
ing?” demanded Stoughton. 

“It’s only a centimeter thick. The 
M-A researchers will fill you in 
later on the new gamma shielding. 
It’s a spinoff of our work, though.” 

‘ ‘Mmm. What does this thing do? ” 

“The best explanation is a dem- 
onstration.” 

Ringefield set the prototype down 
on the desk with a flourish. The 
three Senators watched as closely as 
though they expected him to haul a 
rabbit from a hat. 

Visible in the device’s interior 
were the compact gray bulk of a 
miniature M-A reactor and a deli- 
cate, silver maze of circuitry. One 
of its irregular faces sported a 
digital-clock readout. Senator 
Stoughton absently shook back his 
sleeve and checked his watch. 

“A cesium clock,” said Jean. 
“Far more accurate than the exter- 
nal readout’s capacity could hope to 
indicate.” 

Bernard riffled through a pack of 
iridescent magnetic-plastic chips 
that he materialized from a desk 
drawer, then inserted two into the 
globe’s innards. The clock read 
1019 plus some seconds. “I’ve pro- 
grammed it to start at 1020 and to 
return at 1025.” 



RESCUE ROOM 



9 




Stoughton was not impressed. 
“Start to do what?’’ 

“Watch.” 

The green lines of the readout 
flickered into the new minute. In- 
stantly and soundlessly the patched- 
together prototype disappeared, re- 
placed by a perfect silvery globe 
that in seconds swelled to twice its 
original volume. Ringefield picked 
it up and at Jean’s gentle murmur- 
ing he reluctantly handed it to 
Stoughton. 

“It’s half as massive,” Jean 
pointed out, “or, if you like, half 
as heavy.” 

The Senator stared warily at the 
object he awkwardly hefted. “So 
what is it?” 

“A little Fast Room, obviously,” 
Bernard said. 

“Now listen, Ringefield — ” 

“You’ll see exactly what it is in 
a few minutes.” Jean explained has- 
tily. “We stumbled across it four 
years ago — ” 

“In a much more comfortable 
Research Station — ” 

“While we were trying to get an 
angle on antigravity.” Bernard be 
quiet! “Our team’s approach was in 
the forcible curving of space. We 
found this instead.” 

“Instead? But it is antigravity! 
You just said this thing is half as 
heavy.” The Senator motioned with 
the working model. 

“It’s not practical antigrav,” she 
said. “It’s something more. W'e 
were rushed here as soon as we fig- 
ured out what.” 

Bernard fidgeted and cast a dis- 
approving eye at the burning 
squares of sunlight on the carpet. 

Jean continued: “Only M-A can 
fuel it because it has to be com- 



pletely self-contained. Under that 
condition, any other fuel is far too 
inefficient. It has to carry both the 
Fast Room and its own dead 
weight, and the bumed-out fuel 
can’t be jettisoned as is possible in 
a rocket. With the new neutron- 
conversion reaction there is no 
waste component in M-A — it’s one 
hundred per cent converted to 
energy. Hydrogen fusion, by con- 
trast, is only one per cent effi- 
cient.” 

The shiny ball in Senator 
Stoughton’s hands began to shrink 
and grow more massive. He hur- 
riedly replaced it on the desk. It 
popped out of existence; the junky 
little Room rolled an inch to settle 
on the blotter. Jean retrieved it and 
read the time from its clock. 

“Some few seconds past 1025.” 

Stoughton consulted his watch. 
“It’s only 1022 and a half!” 

Bemaid grinned for the first time 
in months. “That’s what a Fast 
Room is, gentlemen.” 

* * * 

The sun poured into Chamber C 
and struck sparks off Don Wood’s 
carrot-red hair as he joked with the 
technicians. 

On the wall opposite the balcony, 
half a football field’s width distant, 
a huge electronic clock glowed a 
soft green, lazily contesting the 
sun’s skylight invasion. It lacked 
five minutes of 1 1 00. 

Jean Pelham sighed to herself as 
Bernard leaned on the railing a few 
feet from her, pointedly ignoring 
the three members of the finance 
subcommittee. He was seemingly 



10 



GALAXY 




engrossed in the last-minute prep- 
arations for the “flight.” 

“Colonel Wood will be in the 
room for an hour by its clock,” she 
told the Senators. 

By now she had completely for- 
gotten the names of the other two 
men. Like Phobos and Deimos, 
they revolved around Stoughton’s 
Mars, and their reaction to the tiny 
Room made the names Fear and 
Panic very appropriate. I suppose, 
she told herself, that’s the way I 
looked four years ago. But the ex- 
citement has all burned off the sur- 
face now. All that’s left is an occa- 
sional twitch. Her gaze was fixed 
upon Bernard’s fingers, twisting, 
always twisting, the wedding 
band. 

Stoughton harrumphed. 

“Oh! I’m sorry,” she interrupted 
her reverie. “A third of the equip- 
ment you see on the platform is for 
recycling the air. Tanks of oxygen 
would not be sufficient because 
waste air can’t be expelled. The 
cameras are not, unfortunately, 
television. Nothing — matter or 
energy — will pass the Fast Room 
wall. The cameras are simply movie 
cameras. And there are various 
biometric monitoring devices, all 
with recorders.” She tossed her hair 
back. “There’s a timer able to bring 
the Room back if for any reason 
Colonel Wood himself is unable to 
do so.” 

Ringefield leisurely pivoted at the 
edge of the group. “If you’ll direct 
your attention to the center ring, 
gentlemen, the show is about to be- 
gin.” 

The Senators peered down into 
the chamber. Stoughton chewed his 
cigar and shot a disgruntled look at

the unconcerned project director. 

Jean pulled Bernard to one side. 
“What’s gotten into you? These 
men can close us down in a day. 
Swallow your pride and grow up!” 

“I can’t help it,” he said. “That 
damned fool rubs me the wrong 
way on sight.” 

“He’s not a fool. Don’t make 
that mistake. And if you don’t care 
about the Fast Room, the rest of us 
do.” 

She wished she could have 
snatched that sentence back. He 
brushed off her arm and pulled 
away, answering the remark with 
the look in his eyes. The Fast room 
is my life, it said. As much a part 
of it as you are. Maybe. .maybe 
even more. 

She knew exactly how he felt. 

Bernard was clutching the railing 
now. Jean went over to join him, 
one hand reaching out for his. 
Down below, Don Wood — in 

slacks, sport shirt and stockinged 
feet — was in position, the cobwebs 
of the biomonitoring wires disap- 
pearing beneath his shirt and hair. 
He sat crosslegged on the Room’s 
floor, one hand on the single con- 
trol vernier. 

“He’ll be more comfortable than 
we are once he’s cut off from 
earth’s gravity,” Jean assured the 
Senators. 

The digits of the wall clock 
shimmered and shifted to form 
1100. Wood twisted the control. 
Immediately he vanished from sight 
as the Fast Room wall sprang into 
being around him, a perfect super- 
reflective sphere twelve feet in 
diameter. The four metal legs clat- 
tered to the floor and within sec- 
onds the sphere expanded to about 

12 



sixteen feet, twice its first volume. 

Squinting a bit more than neces- 
sary as he leaned into the controlled 
sunlight’s path, Ringefield cupped a 
hand to his mouth. 

“Carl,” he called to one of the 
crew, “bring up one of the legs, 
will you?” He smiled maliciously 
as the two younger Senators put 
Stoughton and Jean between them- 
selves and the Fast Room. 

Jean quickly reassured them. 
“Even if Colonel Wood’s power 
plant were to explode — and it 
won’t — you’d be perfectly safe. The 
Room’s wall is absolutely im- 
penetrable. Absolutely. It’s as 
though the Colonel were in another 
universe entirely. Even gravity, re- 
member, can’t affect him in there.” 
Still uneasy, the men stared at the 
globe being weighed and measured 
now by the technician crew. 

Senator Stoughton’s face lit up, 
however, as he considered the pos- 
sibilities of this property of the Fast 
Room. “Doctor Pelham, what 
causes this barrier?” 

“Well, by forcibly expanding the 
volume of a section of space-time, 
we cause its mass and time to con- 
tract in direct proportion. The 
energy needed to expand Colonel 
Wood and the Room to twice their 
original volume, and so to twice 
normal time-speed, happens to be 
the same we would need to acceler- 
ate them to eighty-seven per cent of 
the speed of light.” 

Stoughton drew a new cigar from 
his pocket and unwrapped it. As it 
ignited itself, he said, “Where 
length contracts to half, mass and 
time expand to twice. The 
Lorentz-Fitzgerald effect.” 
Ringefield’s eyebrows arched as 

GALAXY 




he looked at his wife in silent 
acknowledgment. Exasperating as 
the old furnace-breather was, fool 
he was not. 

It was then that Jean realized the 
mistake she had made — the mistake 
that might cost them the project. 

In taking over the demonstra- 
tion’s explanations she thought she 
had been averting an explosion be- 
tween Bernard and Stoughton. But 
the blast was building in Bernard's 
bitter silence. Get him involved 
enough in words, words about their 
brainchild, and with any luck he 
would become sufficiently absorbed 
to forego personalities. 

Here was her chance. She said 
nothing. 

Finally: “That’s correct. Senator,” 
Bernard grudgingly admitted. 
Three heads swung around. “In 
this case there is not relative mo- 
tion, so the analogy breaks down; 
but in order to answer your ques- 
tion, let’s hold on to the example of 
a spaceship.” 

He held out the piece of metal he 
had received as Jean had talked. 
One end of the Fast Room leg was 
shorn away as if by a jeweler’s 
laser. 

“Think of one end attached to 
that rocket and the other anchored 
to Earth.” 

“The leg would break the mo- 
ment the ship took off.” 

“And so the barrier is formed the 
instant the Room begins to expand. 
No matter the degree, the barrier of 
relativity is impassable. You can’t 
move from one plane of reference 
to another. The plane itself must 
change.” 

Stoughton fell silent. His col- 
leagues, with a cobra victim’s fas- 

RESCUE ROOM 



cination, watched their distorted re- 
flection in the mirror-surfaced ball. 
The crew, with the aid of two trac- 
tors, was sliding a thick, padded 
mat beneath it. 

“Then an enormous Room,” spoke 
up the Senator, “expanding 
Washington just a touch, would pro- 
tect the city from even antimatter 
bombing?” 

“Theoretically, yes. Practically, 
no. You see. .” A long-buried 
glow was creeping back into Ber- 
nard’s features, his antipathy toward 
his audience fading as he ex- 
pounded upon the applications of 
the Fast Room. Once he steered the 
subject away from Stoughton’s 
bomb-shelter hobbyhorse, he was 
able to tell them of its uses in space 
travel, where it would make a fool- 
proof acceleration couch and a per- 
fect antigravity simulator. He 
painted a spellbinding picture of the 
Room’s future. 

At the edge of the balcony Jean 
sighed again, this time in relief. 
He’s done it, she thought as she 
watched the Senators’ rapt expres- 
sions. I think we've made it. 

The huge green digits collapsed 
and reformed into 1130. 

“The short time it takes the 
Room to expand and then to con- 
tract makes our wait a trifle more 
than half an hour,” said Bernard, 
tossing and catching the metal leg 
over and over. They waited. 

1131. 

The shiny sixteen-foot globe sat 
solid and inscrutable on the floor of 
Chamber C. Senator Stoughton 
compared the wall clock and his 
watch. 

“Something’s gone wrong,” 
Bernard said suddenly, his voice a 

13 




strangled monotone. The leg fell 
from his hand with a sharp clatter. 

★ ★ ★ 

Three long minutes had passed. 
One of Stoughton’s satellites finally 
spoke. 

“Can’t you just wait for the fuel 
to run out?” 

“If that analogy holds this far,” 
the senior Senator answered, tossing 
away the stub of his cigar, “and 
this is like acceleration, then it 
doesn’t work that way. You need 
energy to get it there, and energy to 
get it back, but to keep it at a con- 
stant ‘speed,’ you don’t need a 
damned thing. Right, Ringefield?” 

Bernard nodded absently, work- 
ing at his ring more furiously than 
ever. “It will stay there until the 
end of time.” 

The door burst open and Ronald 
Ferrier ran in, panting heavily. 
“What are we going to do ?” he 
wailed, wringing his hands. “How 
much time have we?” 

“The rebreathing apparatus is 
good for twenty hours at the most,” 
said Jean. “That gives us until 2100 
out here.” She shook her head, 
then brushed away the hair that fell 
across her face. “Of course, if it’s 
not the Fast Room generator but the 
M-A reactor that’s gone wrong, 
Don may already be dead.” 

“He’s been exploded in there!” 
cried the other heretofore mute 
Senator. 

Too quietly, unnaturally calmly, 
Ringefield said, “If he has, I know 
where the blame lies.” 

“Bemie, what do you mean?” 
Ferrier shrank back. 

And the Fast Room director fi- 

14 



nally exploded. “It’s this circus 
we’re throwing! We’re not conduct- 
ing a scientific experiment here. 
We’re slapping together a toy for 
these Yahoos! Why should it sur- 
prise us that something’s gone 
wrong?” 

Stoughton’s voice was as calm as 
Ringefield’s a moment earlier but 
he was chewing viciously on a cigar 
no longer there. “/ don’t remember 
forcing you into this.” 

Flinching at the accuracy of the 
barb, Jean turned hastily to Ferrier. 
“There is something we can do, 
Ronald. We can send someone after 
him.” 

Beside her, “Of course.” Ber- 
nard snapped his fingers. “Another 
Fast Room!” 

“Exactly! If two Rooms expand 
to the same degree, they’ll be on 
the same plane of reference, like 
two speeding spaceships motionless 
relative to one another. There will 
be no barrier between them.” 

The two physicists ran out, past 
the elevator and into the stairway. 
Seconds later the supervisor and the 
Senators saw them rush onto the 
floor below, instantly surrounded by 
their anxious team. Ferrier fished 
out a limp handkerchief and mop- 
ped his dripping brow, muttering, 
“2100.” Stoughton reached for an- 
other cigar. 

Then Ringefield broke from the 
group and,, hands on hips, planted 
himself beneath the balcony’s edge. 
“Ferrier, get me eighty kilos of 
anti-iron, fast!” 

“But we used every gram in the 
station for this demonstration!” 

“I don’t care if you borrow it 
from the Urals. Get it!” 

Three hours later a spindly device 

GALAXY 




was taking shape next to the fea- 
tureless sphere in Chamber C, a de- 
vice even less eye-catching than the 
hidden one. The group of scientists 
was feverishly improvising the con- 
struct out of material from the earlier 
small automated Fast Rooms; even 
the one-foot prototype had been 
scavenged from Ringefield’ s office 
and cannibalized. A scant four kilo- 
grams of anti-iron, Ferrier’s claim 
to the contrary, had been collected 
from the station’s other projects and 
now waited with eighty kilos of 
iron in the loading chamber six cor- 
ridors away. 

Ringefield rang Ferrier on the- 
Chamber intercom. The supervisor 
tried to talk first but Ringefield 
jumped him. “Where’s the rest of 
the anti-iron?” 

“Thirteen kilograms is on its way 
from the Yukon Station but — ” 

“But what?” 

“But nobody else,” Ferrier 
gulped, “has been willing to part 
with any.” 

“ ‘Willing to part with any’? Did- 
n’t you tell them what kind of an 
emergency we’ve got here?” 

“Of course I did.” The station 
chief was close to sobbing. “But 
they’re not NASA. It takes days to 
authorize transfer.” 

“ Vlwthorize’?” Ringefield slam- 
med a white-knuckled fist against 
the wall and bolted from Chamber 

c. 

Heads turned to see him disap- 
pear, then the team returned to its 
tasks. Jean took a step away from 
the new Room, toward the door, 
but at that moment one of her 
people came in with an important 
subassembly. It was not until a 
good forty minutes later that she 



could break away and follow Ber- 
nard. 

He was sitting in his office, the 
phone receiver in his hand, the screen 
on the desk blank. His breath came 
in shudders. 

“Nothing,” he said hollowly. 
“Ronald’s right. Oh, antimatter 
security is tight as only ten- 
thousand-dollar-a-kilo security can 
be.” He did not move but just 
stared out the window at the shim- 
mering buttes on the horizon. 

“Would you like me to take 
over, Bernard?” 

He hesitated; then, shaking his 
head, he attacked the dial buttons. 
That call was fruitless, as was the 
next, and the next. 

For the one after that he finagled 
a satellite link to Antarctica. 
“Harry? Bernard Ringefield. We’ve 
got an emergency here.” He de- 
scribed the plight of the astronaut 
marooned mere inches from hu- 
manity. 

In the screen they could see the 
low midnight sun glowing like lam- 
bent ice over the Antarctic ore 
fields beyond Harry Carvin’ s win- 
dow. Carvin sat alone, gaunt 
and bearded, in his controlroom 
office; outside, robot mining 
equipment made its mindless way 
back and forth, back and forth, over 
the steel-hard brown earth. The 
M-A powered ore-smelter building 
loomed above like the play-blocks 
of a somber child giant. 

“Of course you can have all the 
anti-iron I can scrounge up. Let me 
see.” He studied a smudged invoice 
book for half a minute. “I can give 
you a bit less than fifty kilograms, 
Bern.” 

In the Mojave, Bernard and Jean 

15 



RESCUE ROOM 




let out their breath in unison. 
“Thanks, Harry.” Bernard pressed 
the stud on his watch. 1525. “How 
soon can you get it here?” 

“We’ve got nothing very new 
nearby. Three, four hours. The 
loading will take up a. good chunk 
of that.” 

“Ouch. Well, I’ll get off the line 
so you can get started. Thanks 
again, Harry.” 

Harry Carvin waved a depreca- 
tory hand in his office five hundred 
miles from the nearest human be- 
ing. “Sure, Bern.” 

Bernard buzzed Ferrier only to 
find the supervisor still shooting 
zero. “Keep trying, Ronald. We’re 
still thirteen kilos short.” 

As he tried to leap from his seat, 
Jean gently restrained him. “Why 
don’t you rest in here for a few 
minutes, dear?” 

He wiped the perspiration from 
his forehead and laughed weakly. 
“Maybe I should. .1 can feel my 
heart going like a machine-gun. 
No,” and he tore away from her, 
“I’ll rest after Don is baclj:, not be- 
fore.” 

Finally the rescue Room stood 
completed. Aside from a very lim- 
ited chemical rebreather, it con- 
tained no equipment beyond Fast 
Room generator and M-A reactor. 
Jean studied its makeshift lines and 
recalled both Bernard’s outburst 
today and her own a week and a 
half earlier. 

Not ready. And if the reason for 
the first Room’ s breakdown is in the 
pushing forward of the flight date, 
then what can we expect with this 
rush job? 

If only she had not given in to 
Ronald. 

16 



On the balcony above, she saw 
Stoughton talking with the station 
supervisor. Ferrier looked as though 
the Senator had just kicked him in 
the gut. 

Fiscal squeeze be damned! 

The connection she was checking 
blurred. For a moment Don Wood’s 
predicament slipped out of her mind 
completely, leaving only her own 
loss as she wiped away the tear. 
The Fast Room, her Fast Room, 
was dead. 

She blinked. .and there was the 
silent sphere before her. Don’s 
laugh rang in her memory and she 
returned, dry-eyed and capable, to 
the wiring. One phrase in Bernard’s 
words began to carousel around the 
fading laugh. 

Thirteen kilos. 



* * * 

1850. 

A mile from the station the 
workhorse jet from Antarctica 
taxied to a smooth halt. Red- 
jacketed handling crews, on tense 
standby for hours, were ready at the 
night-lit airstrip; unloading the anti- 
iron took the specialized team only 
a fraction of the time the operation 
had taken Harry Carvin. To transfer 
it from smelting plant to jet he had 
had to singlehandedly supervise a 
gang of imbecilic robot equipment 
whose designers had never imagined 
such a task for them. 

The magnetic vacuum vault was 
swiftly but carefully swung out 
from the plane’s bay doom to a 
waiting tractor. The tractor lum- 
bered back to the station in the 
frigid moonlight. 



GALAXY 




The rescue Room, and the vaults 
from the Yukon and from the sta- 
tion’s own supply, waited in ' the 
loading chamber. The last magvac 
vault was put in with them and the 
chamber sealed. The Ringefields 
stood in the control room, separated 
from the ravening potential of the 
anti-matter only by an unreassuring 
wall of inches-thick steel. Calm 
M-A handlers lounged at remote- 
control panels, television screens 
laying open to them every inch of 
the loading chamber’s interior. 

Bernard’s chest was heaving 
again and his fingers were racing 
compulsively over the keyboard of a 
slim electronic calculator. 

“Go ahead,” he told the loading 
director. “We’re not getting any 
more. Load it.” He scowled at the 
calculator, cleared it and stabbed 
away again at the keyboard. 



Air exhausted from the chamber. 
Spidery waldo arms opened the first 
vault. Then invisible magnetic 
beams eased a compact cloud of 
anti-iron dust out of the vault’s 
grasp and into the light. With prac- 
tised speed the handlers guided the 
antimatter toward the rescue Room. 
Occasionally the anti-iron sparkled 
as, in the imperfect earthbound vac- 
uum, infinitesimal annihilations took 
place on the fringes of the cloud. 

The second vault was as swiftly 
unloaded. Then, on the third opera- 
tion, as the formless mass of an- 
timetal edged out of the vault, one 
of the waldos trembled and began to 
slowly swing down into its path. 
The loading director caught it im- 
mediately, bounding over to one of 
the handlers and twisting a lock on 
the man’s panel. 

When Jean finally tore her gaze 





away from the retreating mechani- 
cal arm, Bernard had disappeared 
from her side. She found him in 
their quarters. She almost missed 
him, slumped down as he was in a 
chair before the window, the lights 
out. But when she turned in the 
doorway to continue her search, he 
spoke her name. 

“It’s no use,” he said as she 
walked around in front of him. 
“Don must certainly be dead in 
there. We would only be sending a 
second man to his death.” He 
buried his face in his hands. “As 
dead as our Fast Room!” 

Reaching out for him, Jean mur- 
mured, “No, Bernard. We can’t 
give up on him — or on the proj- 
ect.” The second, the false hope, 
caught in her throat as she felt the 
wracking sobs chase each other 
through his frame. “He must still 
be alive. He must! We could never 
live with ourselves if we gave up 
now.” 

His voice artificially steady, Ber- 
nard spoke as though miles away. 
“We’re twenty-six kilos short of 
fuel. I calculated a hundred and 
sixty by my weight. We would need 
somebody twenty kilos lighter.” 

Out in the arcing desert sky new 
stars twinkled into existence. 

“I’m twenty-kilos lighter. And I 
know the Fast Room better than 
anyone.” 

Bernard was silent, shivering in 
her arms. Then: “It’s a four-meter 
sphere with no exit.” 

“I’ll control myself. I’ll have 
to.” 

A full minute passed. “Yes, I 
guess you’ll have to. I’m sorry, 
Jean.” In the moonlight his eyes 
glistened above his pallid cheeks 

18 



like points of deep-sea phosphores- 
cence. 

Straightening up, she asked, 
“Shall I call one of the doctors?” 

“No, I’ll be all right.” But they 
both knew that he would never be 
all right again. 

★ ★ * 

The rescue Room squatted close 
to the stranded Fast Room in 
Chamber C. On the wall green 
numerals glowed: 1940. Don Wood 
had been in the Fast Room for 
exactly seventeen hours and twenty 
minutes. His would-be rescuers had, 
at the outside, an hour and twenty 
minutes in which to get him out. 

As two tractor-lifts rumbled into 
place facing each other with the two 
Rooms in line between them, Jean 
Pelham shrugged out of her lab coat 
and kicked off her shoes. 

God, but I’m scared ! 

Pulling back her hair and winding 
a rubber band around it, she said, 
“Let’s get under way,” and stepped 
resolutely aboard the rescue Room. 

On the balcony Andrew Stoughton 
stood with Ronald Ferrier, 
the other two Senators having long 
since departed. 

“Ringefield said he needed a 
hundred and sixty kilos of fuel — 
eighty iron, eighty anti -iron. I did 
some figuring; that isn’t nearly 
enough.” He watched Jean and her 
crew talking below and then nodded 
to himself about another subject, 
one entirely apart from fuel figures. 

Ferrier weakly shook his head. 
“When the two Rooms ‘dock,’ 
they’ll salvage the unused hundred 
and fifty kilos in the first Room.” 

“Unless Wood’s M-A exploded.” 



GALAXY 




Stoughton looked even more thought- 
ful now. 

“If Doctor Pelham doesn’t return, 
we’ll at least know not to send a 
third Room.” Ferrier sighed and 
groped for his handkerchief. ’ ’ Even if 
a third Room happened to 
materialize out of thin air. Senator, 
won’t you reconsider — ” 

Neither of them noticed Bernard 
Ringefield step silently onto the 
balcony behind them as Ferrier 
began listlessly expostulating with 
an unhearing Stoughton. 

The rescue Room vanished be- 
hind its own wall, legs clanging to 
the floor. On the wall of the 
Chamber softly shone the numbers 
1947 . 

★ ★ ★ 

As the M-A reactor cut in, Jean 
found herself shut into a dazzling 
cocoon — and instantly weightless. 

If her conscious mind had known 
what to expect, not so her viscera. 
The pit of her stomach flipped over 
and she clutched at the sides of the 
control panel. Her feet flew away 
from the mesh platform as muscles 
involuntarily jerked. 

In her unconscious surprise she 
was able to ignore, for the moment, 
the pressing confines of the Room, 
and within a few minutes she had 
accustomed herself enough to the 
novel sensation to return her atten- 
tion to the verniers, trying to disre- 
gard the fact that they were the only 
part of the platform with which any 
portion of her body was in contact. 
The harsh light from the single bulb 
atop the panel— she had snatched it 
from Ronald Ferrier’ s office — shot 
back undiminished from every point 



on the wall. If only they had re- 
membered a lampshade! 

Where Don Wood’s Fast Room 
control consisted of a triple-throw 
switch, a fuel gauge readout and 
one vernier dial, Jean’s contained 
two extra dials, giving her a finer 
control over fuel flow and thus ex- 
pansion. It would still be seat-of- 
the-pants flying. 

Quickly she brought the Room to 
nearly twice-speed with the “coarse” 
dial. The readout showed that she 
had used the energy that would 
have accelerated her to almost 
eighty-five per cent of the speed of 
light. 

Even as simple a matter as the 
spinning of a dial was immensely 
complicated by the lack of gravity. 
But now that she had reached the 
first stage and was waiting for the 
tractors to move, her confidence — 
even her enjoyment of zero-G — was 
increasing steadily. 

If she concentrated on the panel, 
the mirror qualities of the wall 
made the Room seem gigantic out 
of the comer of her eye; and now 
that expansion had stopped, the 
tractors should be gently pressing 
the two Rooms together. One hand 
reached for the second dial as the 
other held on to one panel. Slowly 
she ' increased “speed.” Slowly, 
slowly. 

The Rooms fell together as their 
degree of expansion coincided. Just 
at the edge of her vision a small, 
dark circle appeared in the wall. 
Don’s M-A had not exploded! She 
slammed the vernier leftward. 

The opening between the two 
Rooms disappeared. Too fast now! 
But the circle that had outlined the 
hole remained. At that point each 



RESCUE ROOM 



19 




sphere was flattened, the barrier 
restored instantaneously as their 
convex edges overlapped. 

The generator began to hum, then 
to scream. Up and up the registers 
of tone and volume the shriek sped, 
vanishing into the ultrasonic. Only a 
perfect sphere could contend with 
the generator’s space-twisting ef- 
fect, Jean realized. No outside force 
could give the wall that dangerous 
flaw — except under the cir- 
cumstances she had just momentar- 
ily created. 

The tractors! She screamed silent- 
ly, her hands uselessly clamped to 
her ears as her bones hummed. 
Back off! Back off! 

* * * 

Don Wood’s matter-antimatter had 
ribt exploded. .although for a 
moment he thought it had. Without 
warning his twelve-foot-diameter 
world had gone black. 

The darkness was absolute. 
Within seconds, however, phantom 
shapes of green and violet began to 
appear, resembling a dim, grainy 
color negative. The after-image of 
the platform dissolved into random 
dots, curves and angles as his optic 
nerves overcompensated for the. 
utter lack of stimuli. 

His universe was no longer 
twelve feet in breadth. It was end- 
less and he was falling through it at 
a speed unimaginable. He had left 
the tiny platform at the other end of 
the universe and it fell light-years 
further behind with every second. 

Now he did not know where his 
arms and legs were. They too fell 
behind like sable comets, unseeable 
in the twinkling, lightless void. 

20 



Then his aim brushed against 
something and he grasped the 
Room’s thin column. His legs 
touched the mesh, or was that the 
paraphernalia upon it? He closed his 
eyes and although the nonexistent 
view remained unchanged, it now 
made conditional sense to the in- 
nermost, primitive sections of his 
mind. 

Don Wood took a deep breath 
and tried to laugh at his unprofes- 
sional moment of panic. The lights 
went out, that’s all. Must be a loose 
connection. 

The astronaut did not completely 
understand how the Fast Room ex- 
panded space; Jean Pelham had ex- 
plained it to him once in the hectic 
days of the past week but he had 
lost her toward the end. “Well, at 
least you understand more of it than 
Ronald Ferrier does after four 
years,” she had said, promising 
him a full briefing after the dem- 
onstration. Unfamiliar as he was 
with its manner of operation, he 
nevertheless knew the physical lay- 
out of the Room’s components like 
he knew the back of the moon. 

He unclipped the sides of the 
control panel and to keep them out 
of trouble in zero-G, he wedged 
them between the controls and the 
reactor. Then he reached inside and 
felt for the rear of the glow-plate 
casing. It was the work of moments 
to follow the wires by feel from 
glow-plate socket to reactor trans- 
former, assuring himself of the in- 
tegrity of the connections. He let go 
and, drifting in the now-unfright- 
ening nothingness, he scratched 
at his head until his fingers 
caught in the biometering wires. 

A gentle susurrus rumbled in his 

GALAXY 




ears like a distant ocean lapping at 
forgotten shores. A calm, insistent 
beat swelled and subsided in con- 
tinuous counterpoint. It was his 
bloodstream, the beating of his 
heart. 

Wait a minute! Where was the 
whirring of the cameras? Sightless 
in the abysmal gloom, they were si- 
lent as well. 

If the light was out. .if the 
cameras had stopped. 

He coughed. 

The atmosphere rebreather. 

Again Wood forced the scream- 
ing terrors back into the closets of 
his brain. The air had not suddenly 
gone sour; his unconscious was 
over-reacting again. But in minutes 
the air would indeed begin to get 
noticeably bad. 

He forced himself to think calmly 
and logically. It was obviously past 
time to abort the flight. But. .hold 
on. The transformer built into the 
reactor was no longer giving out 
electricity. Even if the reactor prop- 
er was still functioning — the Fast 
Room generator used not electricity 
but gamma radiation — the generator 
controls did use the conventional 
juice. He groaned. The generator’s 
actual mechanism was as effectively 
isolated from him as he was from 
Chamber C. 

Wait another minute! Electricity 
powered the magnets that held the 
M-A. If he were still in one piece, 
the magnets must still be operating. 

The magnet emergency reserve 
batteries. 

The air was becoming foul now. 
Weightless, he fumbled, sightlessly 
but by no means blindly, with the 
wiring. The air was growing 
warmer as well with the passing 

RESCUE ROOM 



minutes; the rebreather incorporated 
a cooling system that had fed his 
own radiant heat into the trans- 
former. 

There! 

Any change in the air was not ob- 
servable. He continued working in 
the stifling dark. Finally the glow- 
plate atop the control panel blazed 
forth again. 

And the air was beginning to get 
better. 

Hovering between wall and plat- 
form, he peered at the clock on the 
panel. Powered by atomic break- 
down, it had continued working un- 
seen until restored electrical power 
from the batteries enabled its read- 
out to function again. 

1203 . 

The batteries had been charging 
until the moment the transformer 
failed. Safety back-up that they 
were, they would hold out for days. 

The rebreather would last maybe 
nineteen more hours. Nineteen 
hours in which to perform a miracle 
of rewiring. 

The equipment was situated in 
this order: controls, transformer, 
batteries, rebreather. The rebreather 
wires rerouted from transformer to 
batteries floated free, under no 
strain. The single wire from the 
light and the clock on the panel was 
now taut, however; the control 
multi-cable itself was already tight. 

The biometering wires, spider- 
web-fine, were far too delicate 
for the heavy job. He had his work 
laid out for him, Don Wood re- 
flected, as he reached, tool less, for 
the armored camera cables.

A huge mirror- surfaced ball 

brooded in a place that was almost, 
but not quite, the quadrangle at 
MIT. Slowly it began rolling toward 
the river. Jean, sharing a lunch on 
the lawn with Ronald Ferrier, said 
to him, “The Fast Room is his life. 
He’ll die if he loses it.” The sphere 
caught up with the fleeing Bernard 
and crushed him flat. 

Eight years old, Jean tugged fran- 
tically at the jammed knob of an 
ancient door. Paint-cracked, cob- 
webbed walls closed in as the aban- 
doned house creaked with the 
squeals of its rats. 

The walls began to brighten, to 
flow into quicksilver. 

She was awake. 

Don't think about it don’t think 
about it don’t think what’s the time 
what’s the time let’s see 2136 how 
much does that leave how much 
does that ‘ — 

Too late. 

There was no way that Don’s air 
could last beyond 2100. Silently his 
corpse joined the pictures in her 
overwrought imagination. She had 
failed. 

And for her own return she 
would have to grave-rob the dead 
man’s M-A. 

She was verging on the brink 
now as childhood fear and adult ter- 
ror gibbered at her heel. One small 
part of her mind clawed about for 
stability and pounced upon the 
Room controls. 

The make-do fuel-used indicator 
advanced. 

The second vernier was still sup- 
plying a miniscule trickle of energy 
to the generator. 

Kicking out against the wall, she 
lunged for the control and painfully 

22 



careened about like a billiard shot in 
three dimensions. The idea popped 
into her head that if the platform 
and air were not in there, she would 
bounce off the absolutely reflective 
wall forever. There’s the detached 
scientist making her reappearance , 
Jean thought, reaching for the col- 
umn as she slammed against it. She 
hauled herself to the vernier and 
snapped it to zero. 

The horrors retreated just a bit. 

The wall, she saw, was an un- 
blemished sphere again; the near- 
fatal flaw was gone. She had to re- 
turn to the point where the distor- 
tion had happened and the only way 
to calculate her present incorrect 
“speed” was to judge the amount of 
M-A used. In here she was subjec- 
tively at normal time-speed no mat- 
ter what, and so were any instru- 
ments. 

Jean gasped. Outside it wasn't yet 
2100. She had half an hour more by 
her watch! One long, shuddering 
breath. .and she was back in con- 
trol. 

She pushed away the image of 
Don. There was still a chancel The 
memory of that long-ago night in a 
small, locked room she shunted 
back into the shadows. And the 
dream was fading already. 

Bernard. 

With one final shiver, Jean flip- 
ped over the triple-throw switch and 
began again with the second dial; 
she stopped when her calculations 
warned of the approaching danger 
zone. 

What must they be thinking out- 
side as they watched the globe 
slowly and inexorably swell beyond 
the correct volume in the last 
three-quarters of an hour? Carl must 

GALAXY 




have realized the danger and or- 
dered the tractors to separate the 
Rooms. Now he must notice that 
she had regained control and order 
them in again. He must ! 

With the third — the “fine” — 
vernier, she fed the barest possible 
amount of energy to the generator. 
As slowly as the dial would allow 
she crept up on the marooned 
Room. Gently, with a touch like the 
kiss of dawning sunlight, she kept 
the circuit just closed. Minutes 
crawled by. 

Above her head a small circle 
appeared in the curved wall. She 
slammed the vernier off. The open- 
ing enlarged with the speed of two 
elephantine tractors laboring toward 
each other a universe away. 

“Don!” 

Jean coughed as bad air wafted in 
from the other Fast Room. She 



aimed herself at the opening which 
had stopped growing at a dimension 
of three feet across, and sprang. 

Grabbing the edge of the open- 
ing, she stopped short of smashing 
into the bottom of the other Room’s 
mesh floor. 

“Jean. .” the floating as- 
tronaut grasped as she pushed the 
platform to one side, ducking as the 
rim swept past the opening. Sweat 
gushed down his gray face and his 
breathing was noisily forced. The 
young physicist piloted him into the 
rescue Room and toward the re- 
breather. 

“As soon as I salvage your reac- 
tor,” she told him, brandishing 
wrench and screwdriver that were 
clipped to her platform’s floor, 
“we’ll be getting the hell out of 
here!” 

She had been in time to save Don 




RESCUE ROOM 



23 






from the Fast Room’s clutches. 
What about Bernard? What could 
save him now? 

* * * 

One of the two shining globes 
shrank and disappeared. In its place 
the platform hung suspended 
upside-down and at a slant ten feet 
above the padding. Jean and Don, 
curled into balls, fell into the mat as 
magnetic beams held the rescue 
Room quivering above them. 

Hands reached for the pale as- 
tronaut and as the men and women 
of the crew started to cheer, the Sta- 
tion doctors bundled him into a 
stretcher and carted him away. The 
rescue Room slowly sank to the 
mat. 

Jean was stepping into her shoes 
when a gruff voice behind her said 
feelingly, “Thank God.” She 
whirled to see Senator Stoughton 
and Ronald Ferrier approaching. 

“I am impressed. Doctor 
Pelham,” the Senator continued. 

But almost too low to be heard, 
Ferrier confirmed her suspicions. 
“Jean, the Senator is closing us 
down.” 

Stoughton blew a cottony cloud 
of smoke. “Closing down the Sta- 
tion, yes. We’re in a fiscal squeeze 
this year.” His committee’s vote 
back in Washington was a foregone 
conclusion. “But I think certain 
projects do deserve to remain func- 
tional elsewhere. They show prom- 
ise.” 

“The Fast Room?” 

“I can see the uses of an imper- 
vious barrier. There would have to 
be a shift in personnel though. 



Jean stared past the Senator. 
Above them, on the balcony, 
Bernard stood alone. In the shadow 
she could not read his expression. 

Their brainchild was not dead 
yet. 

“I would very strongly recom- 
mend your appointment as director. 
I’ve seen your record — and I’ve 
learned a lot more today. Without 
you — no project.” 

Ferrier, still absorbed in the loss 
of his Station, mumbled, “Bernard 
needs the rest, Jean. Like me. .” 

She remembered sharing a lunch 
on the grass with Ronald and saying 
something to him and watching the 
juggernaut beyond. 

Can you understand, Bernard? I 
have to save you from it. But I have 
to keep it alive for you. 

And for me. 

“Yes, Senator. I would be will- 
ing.” 

Above, Bernard slowly turned 
and walked away. His wedding ring 
had finally slipped off under the 
constant twisting. Thoughtfully he 
shoved it into his pocket. 

Stoughton took Jean by the arm 
and led her out after Ferrier and the 
crew. At the door she stopped to 
flick off the lights but did not look 
back. 

In the balcony doorway Bernard 
Ringefield did look back, at the 
Fast Room twinkling in the moon- 
light and the rescue Room over- 
turned beside it. 

In a cracked whisper he mur- 
mured, “Thank you, Jean.” 

The green digital numbers softly 
flickered and changed. .forging 
steadily ahead toward midnight and 
the new day. ★

A lonely story 
of a lonely man 
on a lonely world 



The wind came hard off the des- 
ert, crashing into the cliff face be- 
neath him and then swirling away, 
losing itself in the rocks. It was a 
dry wind, and ten years of it had 
turned his skin to leather and his 
deep black hair to a peppery gray. 
It had also done things to his soul. 

Standing alone on the ridge, fac- 
ing the red-orange wasteland, Derek 
Carson was the image of every 
other man who had ever searched in 
the desert for something he could 
not really expect to find. Derek 
Carson’s desert, however, encom- 
passed the world and he was the 
only man from earth to ever live on 
its sands. 

He turned slowly up the trail to- 
ward the hogan, his step less lively 
than it had been during his first few 
years here. Time had also taken its 
toll on Frank. The dog was in the 
shade of their domelike plastic shel- 
ter tent and when it saw Carson ap- 
proach, it raised its head and 
swirled eddies in the dust with its 
wiry tail. 

“How was your day?” Carson 
asked the dog. “Anyone drop by?” 

Frank, in his eternal good humor, 
rolled out his tongue and thumped 
his tail harder. Age had clouded the 

THE BREATH OF THE LILY 



animal’s eyes and stiffened his 
bones, making it clear that he was 
not long for this world or any other, 
but for the time being at least, he 
was good company for the man. 
Carson gave him an affectionate 
scratch behind the ears before con- 
tinuing on into the hogan. 

The routine at the end of the day 
was well-established. He would go 
first to the revitalizer and pour in a 
packet of crystals, routinely, with- 
out bothering to read the label on 
the vial. Then, while waiting for 
them to recycle, he would review 
his notes for the day. Once the eve- 
ning stew had emerged from the 
bowl at the base of the revitalizer, 
he would settle down in front of the 
transcriber and recite his evening 
report between mouthfuls. 

“Activate,” he told the machine. 
“Day three thousand, six hundred 
eleven. Discovered a slow leak in 
the water tank and repaired it. Es- 
timated loss less than five liters; it 
will not seriously restrict supply 
prior to replenishing by supply ship. 

“Continued investigation of pres- 
ence of free oxygen in atmosphere 
and have made no further progress 
in explaining it. Outstations no 
longer seem to indicate variance in 
oxygen levels between readings, 
and earlier recordings may have 
been in error.” 

Frank padded through the door 
and went directly over to him, plac- 
ing his head in Carson’s lap and 
staring up at him with the most sor- 
rowful look his clouding eyes could 
manage. Carson fed the dog some 
of the meat from the stew. 

“Tomorrow I will travel to the 
sulphur springs in the thirty-eighth 
sector, first quadrant, to re-examine 



27 




the possibility of chemical break- 
down occurring there. Endlog. 

“Personal log, code Getback, 
lock in, authorization only. Today 
again broke universal law by reliev- 
ing myself on the north ridge. 
Perhaps one day the ancestors of 
my released bacteria will evolve to 
populate this godforsaken rock.” 

He looked down at the dog and 
scratched the matted fur behind an 
upraised ear. 

“Then I’ll have someone else 
around to talk to. No offense in- 
tended, Frank.” 

The dog looked at him 
questioningly. 

♦ ¥ ¥ 

“Frank?” 

He stepped outside the hogan and 
into the searing heat of the mid-day 
sun. The wind danced about him, 
sucking up tiny dust devils and 
smashing them against the rocks. 

“Frank?” 

The dog had left sometime during 
the night and gone off into the hills. 
He had not done that in almost a 
year, and it had been three years 
since the animal had been gone for 
more than a few hours; but when he 
was younger, the first few years on 
the planet, he would be gone for a 
week at a time, searching for some- 
thing the lifeless planet would al- 
ways be unable to offer him. 

Carson called once more and then 
headed for the ATV that would take 
him on his day’s journey. He was 
forced to keep the tractor half a 
mile from the hogan since the shel- 
ter was nestled in a field of boul- 
ders near the cliff face. The boul- 
ders had been deposited by a vol- 

28 



canic cataclysm millenia before and 
had formed a maze that was as an- 
noying to Carson as it was compli- 
cated. Carson had elected to live 
among the rocks, though, so that he 
would have an unrestricted view of 
the desert floor from the top of the 
cliff. The first supply ship in ten 
years would land out there on the 
desert, probably within the month. 

The wind danced around him as 
he emerged from the boulders and 
strode toward the tractor. The glar- 
ing sun reflected sharply off the cab 
and he was forced to squint and 
look away from it as he ap- 
proached. 

His bones creaked in protest as 
he pulled himself up the ladder to 
the cab and strapped himself in. 
The turbine beneath him activated 
with a gentle purr at his oral com- 
mand and he slid the shift into gear. 
With a mechanical groan the ATV 
lurched forward — and he heard a cry 
of bewildered pain. 

Carson hit the brake and an in- 
stant later was on his knees in the 
sand beneath the vehicle. 

The single wheel at the front of 
the tractor had ridden completely 
over the dog, and Frank was look- 
ing up at him in confused terror, 
fighting for breath that would no 
longer come. 

“Frank, please, I’m sorry. Un- 
derstand that, please ... I didn’t 
mean. ...” 

Hd reached forward gingerly and 
touched Frank’s side. Without warn- 
ing, the dog jerked forward spas- 
modically and raked its worn teeth 
across its master’s hand. Carson 
pulled his hand back quickly, 
clutching the wound. Frank, 
exhausted now, fell back on his side 



GALAXY 




in the shadow of the tractor. 

“Frank, I. Carson found 
apologies and neglected kindesses 
forcing their way uselessly into his 
throat. He leaned forward again, 
more cautious this time, and 
scratched Frank between the ears. 
Something red began to bubble up 
from behind the dog’s teeth. 

“Frank, you’re ... all they left 
me here. If I . yelled at you or 
seemed too preoccupied to care, it 
was my own frustration showing. I 
tried to be as good to you as I 
could. You understand, don’t you?” 

Frank stared at him, tongue out, 
panting. 

“Look, I’ll get some water for 
you. From the tractor. Hold on just 
a minute longer. I’ll be right back.” 

He climbed into the cab, drew 
the canteen from under the seat and 
returned, but he was too late. The 
dog was dead. 

★ * * 

The sand of the secret floor had 
been baked hard by a million years 
of incessant sun, and it fought the 
blade of his shovel. He had worked 
on the grave for nearly an hour and 
still it reached only a few feet 
down, a mere scratch in the waste- 
land. 

Carson sat with his feet in the 
half-finished grave and looked at 
the body of his friend. If this had 
been the earth, there would be flies 
buzzing around it now. He wouldn’t 
have been able to stand that. 

Frank had wandered off in search 
of cool shade and had found it 
under the tractor, where he had fall- 
en asleep. He had been an old dog, 
nearing his time, but knowing that 



did not help. Carson had run over 
the only dog on the planet with the 
only vehicle. 

“You damned fool.” He said the 
words to himself and to the dog, 
simultaneously. They echoed out 
across the stillness and died some- 
where in the desert. 

He raised his head sharply, listen- 
ing. 

There was no wind. For the first 
time in ten years the air was still. 
Carson stood up, suddenly 
frightened, the silence screaming at 
him. 

“The wind!” he shouted aloud. 
“Where is the wind?” 

It was, impossibly, gone. He 
turned and in his confusion he 
nearly slipped into the grave. Catch- 
ing himself, he noticed a tiny 
flicker of light in the broken soil 
beneath him. He hesitated, fixing 
his eyes on it. 

There was something there, a tiny 
glow of light. He climbed into the 
grave and reached for it. 

The glow came from the smooth 
edge of an object still half-hidden in 
the red-orange soil — an object as 
smooth as glass. He worked at the 
dirt around it, scraping with his fin- 
gertips, prying, twisting, clawing, 
until he had broken the thing free. 
Then he held it up into the light of 
the alien sun. 

It was a statue. 

On a world where no man had 
ever lived! 

It was a beautifully carved statue, 
shaped from material that looked 
like glass and felt like metal; its 
color was a pale blue, and it 
seemed to glow luminously from its 
crystal depths; it had been carved 
by a master and, most amazing of 



THE BREATH OF THE LILY 



29 




all, it was human. 

It was the figure of a woman of 
earth, the most beautiful woman he 
had ever seen. What was she doing 
here, buried in the sand of a planet 
where she could never have lived? 

The answer was obvious, he de- 
cided, running his hands gently over 
the smooth form. He had lost his 
only friend — and now the planet 
had provided another. A goddess, at 
that. Weeping in gratitude, he 
pressed the statue against his weath- 
ered cheek; and again he was 
shocked. He held the figurine to his 
nose and sniffed curiously. 

There was no mistaking it. The 
statue gave off an odor, 
but . what was it? Perfume? As 
part of its art? Perhaps. The scent 
was so faint and subtle that he 
could barely notice it; yet he was 
sure it was present. It was a warm, 
familiar smell, a memory of a night 
long ago and a distant garden where 
he had sat with . her. He re- 
membered the soft, gentle smell of 
her and how, when he had asked, 
she had told him the name of her 
perfume. That name had stayed 
with him, as had a million other 
bits of trivia concerning her. The 
perfume had been called The Breath 
of the Lily. 

He held the statue at arm’s length 
and stared at it. No, there was no 
resemblance. But still. 

“I’m going to call you 

Dorothy,” he whispered. 

He placed the figure upright on 
its small base, near the grave, and 
looked at it often as he finished his 
chore. Then, when Frank was prop- 
erly buried, he took it back to the 
hogan, whistling on the way. 

And still there was no wind. 



* ★ * 

Derek Carson poured a vial of 
crystals into the revitalizer and there 
was a faint buzz as the pulses began 
to reconstitute it. While he was 
waiting, he turned and looked at the 
statue again. 

He had placed her on the top 
shelf of the storage rack. There was 
plenty of room for her there since 
she was only six inches tall. He had 
turned her so as to face the 
room — and so that he could see her 
and talk with her. 

“You know, you’re going to 
create a hell of a mess for my col- 
leagues back home,” he told her. 
“They have this planet all classi- 
fied. Nice and neat, the way they 
like things. Never any life here, not 
much hope of there being any. 
That’s why they sent me here — but 
we don’t have to go into that. 

“But now you’re really going to 
botch things up for the boys. 
They’re going to want to know who 
made you, and why. They’re going 
to analyze you, categorize you, 
bisect you and trisect you, to find 
out your secrets. If they can ... if 
I tell them.” 

The revitalizer beeped and 
dropped his evening stew out the 
slot in the bottom. He picked it up 
and tasted the first few scorching 
mouthfuls, staring at her thought- 
fully. 

“At least you don’t ask for any,” 
he said, and was immediately sorry 
he had said it: It brought back the 
other memory, the more recent one, 
that he regretted. He looked around 
for something to change the subject 
with, sighted the radio and pointed 
to it.

GALAXY 




“See the little bulb on top of 
that?” he asked the statue. “That’ll 
blink red in a week or two as the 
supply ship homes in on us and 
starts making its final descent. It’ll 
give us about a day’s notice. 
They’ll be bringing all kinds of 
things. Food. Holotapes. Clothing. 
Water. But do you know what else, 
the most important thing of all? 
There’ll be people there. People to 
talk to. I haven’t heard another 
voice, oiltside of the holotapes, for 
six years, and then it was a 
normal-frequency beam from Lin- 
colnsted. A voice six years old, 
wanting me to relay word down the 
line that King Rebudton had died 
and that Warslas was accepting the 
throne. I sent it on but I don’t sup- 
pose anyone is close enough to 
reply for four or five years yet.” 

He chewed the last morsel of the 
stew and set the emptied bowl on 
the disposal plate. The activator 
whistled its three-second warning 
and then the bowl was gone. 

“The men on that ship will want 
to know what I’ve found here, 
Dorothy. Not much, I’m afraid, 
until now. I still can’t tell them why 
there’s enough free oxygen in the 
air, and enough humidity from 
somewhere, to make it possible for 
me to exist. I can’t tell them any-, 
thing, but unless I have something 
to offer them, they might not want 
to take me home yet.” 

He walked over and picked her 
off the shelf. The Breath of the Lily 
drifted past his nostrils. He studied 
her, rubbing his thumb gently along 
the lines of her naked body. 

“So should I tell them about 
you? Do they deserve to know? 
Maybe. First, though, we’re going 

THE BREATH OF THE LILY 



to have to find out what a nice lady 
like you is doing in a place like 
this.” 

He chewed his lower lip for a 
moment, staring at her, then re- 
placed her on the shelf. Walking 
back to the cot, undressing and 
climbing into bed, he was once 
again an old man who had been iso- 
lated on a dead world for too long. 
But just before he drifted off to 
sleep, he looked at her once 
more — gleaming luminously from 
her perch — and some of the boy 
within him shone through. 

★ ★ * 

The wind. 

He sat up straight on the bed. 

“Dorothy, it’s back. The wind.” 

Above him, beside him, all 
around him the tent was alive with 
the rustle and whisper of the wind. 
From far beyond, from the hills 
flanking the desert, he could hear 
the lonely cry of air forcing its way 
to uppermost peaks and pinnacles. 

“Dorothy, can you hear it? The 
wind came back!” 

He stood, excited, and switched 
on the light. 

She was gone. The top shelf of 
the supply rack stood empty. 

“Dorothy?” 

He stepped forward, confusion 
dancing through his mind. He 
touched the shelf, ran his hand 
along it, seeing but refusing to be- 
lieve. 

“Dorothy . you. .” 

He spun around, searching the 
floor, searching the lower shelves. 
Each moment pressed on him until, 
frantic, he was ripping supplies 
from their places and scattering 



31 




them across the poured concrete 
floor of the hogan. 

The statue was gone. 

He raced to the door, tearing it 
open. Outside, the sun had dropped 
below the horizon little more than 
an hour earlier; another sixteen 
hours would pass before it returned. 
Out of the darkness of the newborn 
night the wind battered him vi- 
ciously. 

“Dorothy!” he called into the 
void. 

He pushed his way into the open 
area in front of the hogan, strug- 
gling against the rising wind. Stum- 
bling, clawing, running, he made his 
way to the trail that wound down 
through the rocks to the desert 
floor. His eyes searched the way 
frantically. 

The wind almost masked the 
sound off to his right. He whirled, 
facing down another meandering 
trail through the rocks. What might 
have been a shadow, or an eddy of 
swirling, windblown dust, hung for 
a moment in the darkness of the 
trail and then slipped from sight. He 
couldn’t be sure that he had seen 
anything at all, but it meant hope 
and. 

He started in the direction of the 
shadow and then balked, quickly 
changing his course and heading 
back to the hogan. His gun was in- 
side, on the rack. It was an old gun 
and had never been taken from its 
spot; when he checked the charge, 
there was barely enough left to 
harm anything, but it would have to 
do. 

Prepared now, he charged out- 
side, running toward the rocks. The 
wind was already falling off, as 
though holding its breath in antici- 

32 



pation. As he entered the 
passageway between the first boul- 
ders, he heard it bubbling and whis- 
pering in the shadows nearby. Un- 
certain as to why, he suddenly 
began to advance cautiously. 

“Dorothy?” 

Nothing. Nothing but the wind 
playing hide-and-go-seek, laughing, 
teasing him, telling secrets to the 
dust. 

“Dorothy?” 

Nothing. Nothing but the wind 
gathering in the hidden places, 
growing in strength, waiting for him 
to come so it could pounce like a 
hungry beast and devour him. 

He stopped at the place where he 
had seen the shadow. The wind fin- 
gered the cuff of his pants and nib- 
bled at his toes. He bent down, 
carefully examining the sand. 

The wind had brushed it clear. If 
there had been anything there, the 
wind had taken away every trace of 
it. 

He rose, listening. The wind was 
drawing back and in a moment the 
silence would be deafening. His 
stomach began to turn uneasily. 
There was something more to 
this. 

There was something behind him. 
He was sure of it. Something star- 
ing hungrily at the back of his neck 
and making the hair bristle and rise. 
His finger slipped down to the trig- 
ger of the gun. He tried to swallow 
and found his throat parched. 

Carson turned, flinging himself to 
the side. The barrel of the gun 
swung upward, aiming into the 
rocks. 

There was nothing there. 

And, at the same time, there was 
something, or many somethings, all 

GALAXY 




around him, in the rocks. Some- 
thing very old . ancient. 

He walked forward, crouched low 
and ready. 

The wind was completely gone 
now. The sound of his bare feet 
crunching over clumps of dirt thun- 
dered and echoed for miles through 
the rocks. 

Echoing. 

The shadow leaped at him from 
the left, and he spun and fired. Dust 
and smoke flew back at him, and 
for an instant Derek Carson went 
blind. 

When the blindness was gone and 
he could open his eyes again, he 
saw the thin crevice in the rocks at 
his side, and the shadow it made 
across the trail. Had the shadow of 
the rock, this rock, startled him? Or 
was there something else? 

He took a step toward the fissure 
and froze: The statue was lying 
half-buried in the dust at his feet. 

He reached down for her, and 
then froze again. 

Her nose and chin had been bro- 
ken off. He felt his knees go weak 
and as he picked up the broken, 
maimed beauty, he heard — 
somewhere far off in the rocks — the 
crying of the wind. 

* * ★ 

“It’s not fair,” he protested 
when he was safely back at the ho- 
gan. 

He sat on the bed with the small 
figure, holding her in his hands and 
regarding her through a blu of 
tears. 

“It shouldn’t have to happen to 
both of you,” he said. “In a way, 
that’s why they sent me here. For 



hurting you once before.” 

Visions flashed through him 
again. The medal that the Science 
Academy was planning to award 
him. The garden, where he had 
gone to tell her about it. Dorothy, 
among the lilacs, with the other. 
Her voice screaming at him, beg- 
ging him not to strike her lover. 
Her lover! His fist lashing out, the 
crunch of bone within her jaw. 

Many things would have changed 
it. If only she had not been a 
daughter of the Minister of the Pre- 
sidium, or a benefactress of the 
Academy. But then, had it not been 
for his reputation, he might not 
have survived. Survived to come 
here, exiled under the guise of a 
scientific quest. Always the plusses, 
always the minusses. 

The wind scratched a thousand 
tiny fingers along the bottom rim of 
the tent fabric. His hold on her 
tightened, his eyes turned to the 
walls of the tent. It was like an 
animal, the wind, scratching around 
the outside of the tent, searching for 
the way inside. Hunting for a 
weakness. 

“You didn’t walk away from 
here, Dorothy,” he told her. “And 
the wind isn’t strong' enough to 
carry you off. So there’s something 
else out there. Something that can 
grab you and run. Something that 
loves you.” 

He turned the statue in his hand, 
considering, and then dropped it 
into the ueep pocket of his vest. 

“Only I’m not giving you up 
again. They took you on earth and 
they took Frank up here. I’m not 
giving anything up any more. 
They’ll have to come and take you 
from me.” 



THE BREATH OF THE LILY 



33 




And, as though understanding 
this, the wind drew away from the 
hogan and lost itself in the night. 

He slept with her clutched tightly 
in his hand and he dreamed of 
things never within his life’s experi- 
ence. The images were incom- 
prehensible but each carried an 
urgency about itself, a plea for un- 
derstanding; and each bore the mark 
of great age, although what it was 
that made them ancient, he could 
not decide. The images themselves 
were unclear but they seemed to be 
the souls of countless billions of 
people walking through fields that 
were green and alive. They seemed 
somehow happy. But they had a 
mission, a place to go, and sud- 
denly they were gone. 

They took the fields with them, 
and the happiness departed as well. 
He could not tell where the people 
went, or why, but he could sense 
the confusion that was left 
behind — although he could see no 
one there to be confused. The con- 
fusion grew into great loneliness 
and the loneliness lingered, and 
then one day there was a touch of 
fire in the sky, and one, just one of 
them, was returning. 

He wore the face of Derek Car- 
son. 

★ ★ ★ 

Derek Carson stood facing the 
west, looking across the desert, 
with the statue in his pocket and no 
wind at his feet. 

“Was someone out there, 
Dorothy?” he asked. “A whole 
race that climbed higher, maybe, 
than we’ve climbed up to now? 

34 



People who, after living here a few 
million years, suddenly decided to 
move? Could they do that, and take 
everything with them? Peel it all off 
the planet like the skin off an 
orange and take it all along with 
them wherever they were going? 
And if they did, why? 

“I read a report once that specu- 
lated that a house knew its 
occupants — in a real sense. Just as 
plants know the people who water 

them, rocks and garden walls and 
fishponds know what’s going on 
around them, on a very primitive 
level. What would happen if a 
whole race left a planet and took 
everything along with it? Would the 
planet they left behind know, and 
remember? Would it get lonely, 
suddenly, without their life? And 

then, seeing someone like them re- 
turn, would it try to make him 
happy so he would stay? Would it 
give him the environment he 
needed, as best it could? And then, 
would it, seeing him overcome by 
tragedy, rush forward impulsively to 
help? Would it wring out 
its . life ... to give him . 
you?” 

He took her out of his pocket and 
gently touched the fracture line 
around the lower half of her face. 

“Then what would happen if it 
decided it had given too much and 
that it was going to be abandoned 
again? What if the planet knew, in 
the long run, that what it had given 
up to give you birth was more im- 
portant? Would it try to take you 
back? And what would it do if I 
said no?” 

He looked up, and the planet an- 
swered. 

He could hear it coming, taking 
GALAXY 





off fifty miles away among the 
hills. It was traveling faster than it 
ever had before. The wind. In an 
instant it had smashed upon the far 
edge of the desert, hurtling down 
from the mountains, and the dust 
rolled up before it in a monstrous 
wave. 

Derek Carson stood paralyzed 
with fear, watching the Deathwind 
scream its way toward him across 
the arid plain, devouring three 
hundred miles an hour and building 
speed. 

“My God!” 

He ran back to the hogan and 
zipped the door shut behind him. It 
was a pitiful, hopeless gesture. The 
shelter was anchored down, capable 
of withstanding winds a hundred 
and forty miles an hour. But not 
this wind. The entire camp would 
be leveled in a blast equal to three 



hurricanes. He looked about in des- 
peration for something to anchor 
on to. 

“This is it, Dorothy,” he found 
himself saying. “Ride this one out 
and you’re mine. This is the big 
play. Their ultimate weapon.” 

He pulled down a coil of rope 
from the shelf and began searching 
for a mallet. He found one quickly, 
along with ring pegs for climbing. 
He hammered the pegs into the ce- 
ment floor of the hogan and ran the 
rope through their iron eyes. This 
completed, it was only a matter of 
seconds before he had himself 
lashed to the floor. 

“I’m ready now! Whatever you 
are, I’m ready for you and you’re 
going to have to tear me to shreds 
before I’ll let you have her! So let’s 
have at it!” 

The first gigantic wave of wind 



tore the hogan from the ground, and 
everything around him went with it. 
He could feel the relentless force 
race under him, grabbing hold of 
him, trying to pull him free from 
the ropes or to tear him apart. The 
bonds creaked and strained, but 
held. 

The dust was a cloak upon him, 
blocking the breath he fought for. 
Undaunted, Carson screamed at the 
wind. 

“You can’t do it! I still have her 
and you can never take her away!” 

He gulped for a breath and drew 
in a mouthful of sand. Gasping, he 
turned his head to the side, trying to 
find clearer air close to the ground. 
The sand swept over him. 

“She’s mine! Bury me and you 
bury her. Tear me apart and she’s 
crushed.” 

The wind screamed back at him 
but the mighty thrust that had car- 
ried it forward had also sapped its 
strength. It still yanked him up- 
ward, slicing the ropes into his 
flesh, but the heart was gone from 
it. In a few moments Carson knew, 
and the wind knew, that he would 
win. 

And, knowing this, the wind 
played its final trump. It fell back 
to a gentle eddy, barely strong 
enough to keep the dust aloft in a 
blinding fog but not too strong to 
mask the sound that came from just 
beyond the range of vision. The 
sound of a barking dog. 

Derek Carson lifted his head from 
the ground. 

“Frank?” 

It came again, soft but distinct. It 
was nearby, but receding. 

“Frank? They’ve brought you 
back?” 

36 



The cry grew fainter, more ur- 
gent, its volume brought back for 
just an instant and then returned for 
resumption of its fate. 

“No! Don’t kill him again! I un- 
derstand!” 

He worked one hand free from 
the ropes, forced it across his chest 
to the statue and began to work her 
from his pocket, where she nad 
been lashed in place. 

“They want a trade, Dorothy. 
That’s the idea. Frank for 
you. ...” 

He held her up, his fingers 
clasped tightly around her. 

“I’m sorry, girl, but . there 
just isn’t a question, you know. 
You were theirs, and Frank was 
mine. There are some things that 
are just more . important.” 

He opened his fingers. The wind 
grabbed the statue; for a fleeting 
moment it was as though a cheer 
rushed back through the wind to 
thank him. Then she was gone. 

The Deathwind died. 

Carson tore away the ropes and 
dragged his battered, bleeding body 
erect. The dust and sand clung to 
him, still suffocating, but now they 
could be ignored. He looked toward 
the desert and whispered, almost 
afraid to hope. 

“Frank?” 

For a moment there was nothing. 
Then, like a curtain, the dust parted 
and his friend was there — mouth 
open in a grin, a younger tail wav- 
ing rapidly, healthy legs carrying 
him toward his master. 

Derek Carson cried as he went 
forward to reunion. 

A mile away, among the rocks, a 
small bulb on a badly battered radio 
began to glow red. ★

She was heir to a Goddess, master of the 
ancient mysteries. But the forces she 
faced were deadlier than ail her 
magics 



Brit huddled in the har- 
bor of the cave' tugging her matted 
fur cloak tightly about her. Outside, 
the rain sluiced off a ragged over- 
hang, gouging deeper its ancient 
rut. The bones of the countryside, 
ancient stones, cut through the 
rounded hills, and the rain became 
mist in the distance. 

How long before they came? Al- 
though she could see no one in the 
fog- veiled valley before the cave’s 
entrance, her neck and fingers 
prickled with a sense of their near- 
ness. It was the witch-sense, the 
weirding, that warned her of their 
approach. That same sense told her 
that the life which quickened in her 
womb would be a daughter, red- 
haired. 

Brit felt exhaustion settling upon 
her shoulders like a great weight. 
Hunger, fear, chill, combined in an 
inestimable weariness. She offered a 
silent prayer to the Great Mother 
that her trial would be over soon, 
that they would come and make an 
end to her waiting.' 

Fearn. That’s what her Mother 
had called them. Brit tasted the 



word. It was an old name. It had 
become, through the long years, 
only an old tale used to stir the 
spirit and keep the old ways. Now 
the word had become flesh. 

She remembered the day she had 
first heard the word. Mother and 
she had gone for a long walk about 
the hills near the sea. They had 
spent the day naming the herbs and 
wildflowers, for it was her Mother’s 
hope that Brit would have some 
skill in the healing arts. Brit still 
knew those names, their given 
names, and the secret ones which 
called out their essence. 

As the two passed a rock out- 
cropping stained red by the dripping 
of the water, her Mother spoke: 

“What is this called, Brit?” 

She had thought for a moment, 
then raised the word from her 
memory. 

“Iarn, Mother.” 

“It has another, older name, 
Daughter, a name you must leam.” 
A tautness lined her Mother’s face. 
“It is — Fearn." 

As she spoke, her Mother took a 
stick and drew the rune into the 



FEARN 



39 




ground before the stone, then 
handed the stick to her, making her 
trace it in the dust. Brit repeated the 
name. It gave her a strange, cold 
feeling as she did so. Her Mother 
stirred the dust, so as to leave no 
trace of the marie. 

The work meant iarn, but it 
didn’t. It also meant fear. In some 
strange way Brit did not understand, 
it was also an evil word, never to 
be spoken casually. 

* * * 

She heard it next from a father of 
hers, Pon by name, who had lain 
with her Mother several summers 
before. By him she had a sister, 
called Jo. 

On that day, Pon was playing 
with them, showing them how to 
parry and thrust with a quarterstave. 
Such combative arts were left to the 
men-folk to teach, as they were not 
as a rule good at fishing, or weav- 
ing, or making spells. 

Pon grew heated with the game, 
making wild passes in the air with 
the staff, cracking it at last against a 
rock. It splintered, showering chips 
of hardwood. 

He swore a coarse oath and 
cried, “Bah! If only this were a 
staff of — iarn!" 

The way he paused told Brit he 
meant to call it by another name. 
She, being then a brazen girl of two 
moons and forty seasons, shot back: 

“Made of what?” 

He grimaced, as if speaking of 
something unspeakably wicked, yet 
delightful. 

“ Fearn .” he whispered, “But 
She will not let us touch it!” 

40 



Brit’s ears burned at his blas- 
phemy. 

* * * 

But she had not learned the full 
tale until Maeve, Priestess to the 
Great Mother, called her aside one 
day. 

Maeve had spoken to Brit in pri- 
vate before, in the quiet little meet- 
ings not meant for boys, reserved 
by Maeve for her “young ones,” 
girls who had shown some promise 
in the divinatory arts. Brit was by 
far the best at the Letters. She had 
quickly learned the six-and-twenty, 
and the three Runes of Power, what 
each was for and how it must be 
used. And she had shown surprising 
skill at some of Maeve ’s tests, 
exercises to see if she possessed the 
weirding skill. 

But now, nearly a year to the day 
after her blood-day, on the eve of 
the full moon, Maeve drew her 
aside, to speak with her alone. They 
withdrew to the cool, whitewashed 
shelter of the shrine of the Goddess, 
a holy yet earthy place none might 
enter unbidden. 

Maeve grasped Brit’s smooth 
young face in her gnarled hand. 

“ Astered she whispered, call- 
ing Brit by her True Name, “Thou 
knowest that I have watched thee 
these thirteen years with a keenness 
which hast caused thee some un- 
seemly airs. Yet, thou knowest also 
that it is thee who is my best pupil, 
who has learned most quickly and 
with the most diligence the names 
of the Holy Runes and their 
stories.” 

Brit nodded mutely. 

“ Astered , I have looked long into 

GALAXY 




my future today, and I do not like 
what I see, for any of us. There are 
things I must tell thee now that I 
had not intended to speak until 
much later. But now there is no 
calling it back.” 

Maeve traced the dark rune on 
the floor, obliterating it with the 
same stroke. 

“Tell me, young Brit, what you 
know of this mark.” 

Brit barely whispered the name, 
but Maeve coiled back a little. 

“So little fear, young one. Tell 
me of it, then.” 

Brit told what little she had 
gathered, that it was a word of great 
and dark power, that it meant both 
iarn and fear, that it was masculine 
in gender and, hesitantly, that 
“one of the fathers” had laughed 
wickedly at it once. 

Maeve nodded. “This is more 
than most know. Your Mother was 
a good and wise woman, though 
without sight. Tell me, Brit, who 
owns your house?” 

Brit puzzled at this turn in the 
conversation. 

“Why, my Mother, good 
Maeve.” 

“And who the kine and sheep?” 
“My Mother.” 

“Though she be dead?” 

“Yes, good Maeve, through my 
Mother, her sister.” 

“And who owns you?’! 

“Who owns me, good Maeve? In 
truth I do not know. I myself, 
perhaps. ...” 

“Well said. And your brothers?” 
“I suppose they also own them- 
selves,” said Brit. “Though of 
course, we are all Hers,” she added 
hastily . 

“How would it be if you were 



owned, Brit, like the cows and 
sheep?” 

“How could that be, Maeve? The 
animals are given us by Her, that 
we may care for them.” 

Maeve drew the rune for man on 
the ground. 

“What is this?” 

“That is a man, good Maeve.” 

Maeve crossed it with the letter 
for iarn . 

“What do you see now, Daugh- 
ter?” 

The dread sign, fearn, had been 
made again. 

“It must mean — ‘man made of 
iron,’ is that right, good Mother?’’ 

“Well read, Brit. Come. Let me 
tell you a tale.” 

As they sat talking, Maeve brewed 
a strong potion of herbs. Brit 
felt a strange sluggishness overcome 
her limbs as its fragrance filled the 
air. Maeve stretched out her hand, 
holding a small cup, bidding her 
drink. 

Though her hands trembled, Brit 
drank the mixture. As the strange 
brew warmed her belly, she began 
to feel light-headed. Maeve’s voice 
droned in her ears, telling her an 
old, old story. As Brit followed the 
track of the words, she began to see 
the images old Maeve described as 
if she herself were witnessing them. 

There was a city, white and 
gleaming, where great, beautiful 
women and men walked by the sea. 
In the palace of the Queen, she saw 
smiths working bronze in the flame, 
one part of tin to nine parts of cop- 
per, as the old formula goes. Here 
the smiths were men, for their great 
arms and broad backs made the 
work go faster. 

Next she saw another city on a 

41 



FEARN 




point of rock, this dark and mas- 
sive, built like a great cave. Men 
only walked the streets, in the dress 
of ones who were ready to do bat- 
tle. Their bodies were covered with 
metal, not copper or bronze, or 
silver or gold, but a thin metal of 
black color — iarn. 

Another smith was at work here, 
his body gnarled, his red- bearded 
face set in a permanent scowl. He 
knelt at the forge, working metal to 
red-hot temperature, then drew it 
out and began to beat it into shape. 
When it was done, a sharp pointed 
longsword of the glowing red metal 
lay on the anvil. 

As Brit watched, a young woman 
in chains was brought screaming 
into the room. The smith took the 
steaming blade and drove it into her 
side. Brit wanted to turn aside but 
was powerless to look away. The 
smith drew out the blade as the 
woman fell. Laying it again on the 
anvil, he scribed a single letter on 
its hilt — Fearn. 

The scene changed. Suddenly the 
streets of the white city were filled 
with the men in iarn. They were 
killing and raping the women at 
every hand. Blood ran in the 
streets, the color of the molten iarn, 
as the women and men met the at- 
tack bravely but were smitten by 
force of numbers. 

As the vision faded, a number of 
women are climbing into the prow 
of a sleek sailing ship, many taking 
babes with them, and loosing the 
ropes. As Maeve’s grave old face 
appeared again before Brit, she saw 
the city from out on the water, 
flames the color of blood dancing in 
the mins. 

“You have seen , then.” 



Brit nodded. 

“You have the skill. It is as I 
hoped — and feared,” said Maeve. 
“Tell me, Daughter, do you under- 
stand what you have seen?” 

“A little, Maeve. This was long 
ago.” 

“Yes. These women were our 
Mothers, who fled here years ago in 
refuge from these men and their 
stem god whose name means ‘man 
of iron.’ Now, why did I ask you 
those questions about ownership, 
good Daughter?” 

“These men, these — Fearn,” 
Brit barely breathed it, “they took 
women and men as possessions, as 
if they were cattle or sheep.” 

“True, Brit. Well seen,” said 
Maeve. “Since that time, iarn 
means only ill luck to she who 
touches it.” 

Taking both her hands, Maeve 
made Brit swear grave oaths about 
the dread metal, then searched Brit 
deeply with her cold eyes as if 
seeking something she was not sure 
she would find. 

“Brit, I will speak plainly,” said 
Maeve at last. “I have chosen you 
to succeed me, to be Her Priestess. 
There is a time for this, several 
years hence, after a long and dif- 
ficult apprenticeship, when the best 
of my girls becomes my assistant at 
Her rites and succeeds me upon my 
death.” 

“But you are not dyjng!” Brit 
gasped. “You are well, and I am 
only. .” 

“I know, Brit. But I have had a 
dream, one I fear I have not the 
power to give to you, despite your 
skill.” 

“What is this dream, good 
Mother?” 



42 



GALAXY 




“The Fearn come again, Daugh- 
ter. Not soon, but soon enough. 
Them we thought well behind us 
come and find us again, and work 
their will on us.” 

“But surely, Maeve, She will 
protect us from them.” 

“When I was younger I would 
have believed it so, for then we 
were strong and Her observances 
were well kept. But there are few 
who remember the old ways. There 
is a complacency, a lack of caution 
today. You alone of all my young 
ones have the arts, or soon will 
have them. I must have an ally, 
however young, at this time. Your 
training must begin now, and in 
earnest.” 

“But why?” 

“I tell thee, the faith wanes. The 
women no longer practice the rituals 
with care, and the men become 
surly and boastful. Soon the power 
which protects us will evaporate, 
like a fog at dawn. The flame that 
bums in Her shrine must never be 
allowed to go out. The old songs 
and poems must continue to be sung 
and remembered. Time is short, As- 
tered, and I have need of thee.” 

★ 

That spring, Brit consecrated her- 
self to the Goddess, dressing, like 
Maeve, in robes of white. The 
young girls with whom she had 
played drew themselves aside from 
her, viewing her with a mixture of 
reverence, envy and fear. 

Brit threw herself into the perfec- 
tion of her arts, committing to 
memory all the verses Maeve taught 
her, and all of the healing plants, 




this one to bring labor, this to cool 
a fever. But she also practiced each 
day the weirding, seeing what was 
distant, hearing what was far away, 
and each day attempting to lift a 
bowl of wood or a small stone with 
only her thought. It did not come 
easily. Maeve helped her leam as 
she could. Together they would 
raise a bowl of fruit, or turn aside a 
falling stone. 

Then, one afternoon, in the 
summer of her sixteenth year, she 
was sweeping in the shrine of the 
Goddess and knocked over a fine 
water-jug with the handle of the 
broom. As it fell, she felt her mind 
reach out and hold it, and it righted 
itself, settling gently on the table 
again. 

Brit turned swiftly, feeling 
Maeve behind her. There was some- 
thing clouded in Maeve’s face, a 



FEARN 



43 




mixture of awe and resignation. 

“Well done, Daughter,” said 
Maeve. “Your time is at hand. You 
are ready to join me at the hearth. 
Come, finish your sweeping, and 
we will take a walk together.” 

★ * * 

It was in the autumn of her twen- 
tieth year that Brit was felled by a 
pain in the heart as she was gather- 
ing wood for the hearth of the 
shrine. By the weirding, she knew 
the pain she felt was not her own. 

She gathered her skirts about her, 
and began running back along the 
river bank to the shrine, staggering 
as waves of pain swept over her, 
reddening her eyes and cutting off 
her wind. With an effort of will, 
she thrust the pain from her, rush- 
ing into the small room they shared. 

Maeve lay, ashen-pale, upon her 
pallet, clutching her breast. 

“Brit!” The voice was frail and 
far away, but filled with an inner 
strength. 

“Brit, time is short. Bring my 
herbals here, quickly.” 

Brit gathered up the preparations 
for the trance in which deep knowl- 
edge was passed from one Priestess 
to another, her hands moving with a 
sureness which seemed to come 
from outside her. 

When the brew was prepared, 
Brit poured a cup of the heady po- 
tion and sat beside Maeve on her 
severe cot. The fumes from the cup 
rose between them, and their eyes 
met. 

“ Astered . Harken unto me,” 

Maeve whispered. “I and thou are 
one. Her Truth must be passed. Be 
as a vessel to me and I shall fill 



thee. Now, here are the names of 
She who is our Mother; The Mother 
of Time, The Namer of All Things, 
The Maker of Light. ...” 

Brit did not reckon the passage of 
the hours as the old lore, oft- 
recited, was said again. From the 
names of the letters to deep mat- 
ters of life and death, the whole of 
the Litany passed from Priestess to 
Apprentice, from Mother to Daugh- 
ter. Through all, Maeve’s hand 
gripped hers with an urgency that 
seemed to draw the strength from 
her. 

At last, after night had fallen, 
and the stars had wheeled in their 
courses, Maeve paused. Brit shook 
her head like one awakened. She 
saw her frail teacher as a dry husk 
of skin, sinew and bone, with only 
a faint spark of light. 

Brit brought water. Maeve quaf- 
fed the goblet, then pulled her near 
again. 

“ Astered , I give thee what thou 
wilt give me. This moment has al- 
ways been, and, in this time, thou 
gavest me a vision. I give it to thee 
now — or rather, we share it, so that 
when it comes to pass, thou mayest 
have it.” 

“I do not understand, Maeve.” 

Maeve shook her head. “It does 
not matter, young Daughter. Open 
yourself to me while my strength 
lasts, for we shall not speak again. 
This, too, I have seen.” 

Brit threw her arms around the 
old woman, and tears began to 
course her cheeks. 

“Oh, Maeve! Do not go. Surely 
this is not your time. You will yet 
live a while.” 

“Be still, Brit. Our time is short, 
and we must use it well. Farewell, 



44 



GALAXY 




Daughter. She who guides the stars 
will guide our lives. She who mea- 
sures out our skein of life also cuts 
it. Our lives are given into Her 
care, and we must do as She wills 
with them. Your duty is to carry 
on. Mine is — mine is to join Her.” 

Maeve took from her neck the 
cord which held the silver disc in- 
cised with the crescent moon. With 
faltering hands, she placed it about 
Brit’s neck. 

“It is thine now, Astered — the 
power, the privilege, and, yes, the 
pain. Thou must be Her incarnation 
on the earth. This is thy destiny, 
before all else. Let nothing turn 
thee from it.” 

Brit felt a coolness settle over 
her, and the world receded from her 
slightly, as if a veil were passed be- 
tween her and it. To her eyes, 
Maeve appeared shriveled, small. 
She could barely hear her voice. 

“Come, see with me. It is sum- 
mer. The village is in full green. 
You bring water from the 
stream. .” 

* * ★ 

It happened just as the vision 
foretold. It was an unlikely day for 
doom, for cataclysm. The bright 
yellow and green of Her abundance 
covered the land, and the young, 
bom in spring, tried their new legs. 

Brit, dressed in the long white 
robe of her office, carried an earth- 
en jug to the stream to fetch water 
for her morning libations. The bitter 
winter past, the cruel death of her 
teacher, Maeve, even the vision of 
this day so vivid when it came, 
were distant in her mind. 

But, as she lifted the brimming 



jug from the water, as she did every 
morning in summer, the sharp clar- 
ity of light began to dim. The sad 
song of the bird above her matched 
the notes of her vision one for one. 
The jewels of water droplets on the 
handle of the pitcher were as they 
had been. 

A feeling greater than terror grip- 
ped her. She grasped the jug handle 
more firmly, ready to turn it out on 
the grass, but her hand would not 
move. If this moment could some- 
how be turned aside, she would 
forestall the inevitable. But her feet 
led her up the bank, following the 
path that led through the wood to 
the shrine. She found herself whis- 
tling a hymn idly. This only 
deepened her fear. 

Though she knew what she would 
see within the low building which 
gleamed pretematurally white in the 
sun, she was nonetheless stricken at 
the sight. The bowl of oil from the 
altar lay in fragments on the floor, 
its wick coiled like an obscene 
snake. The flame was out. 

Though she made the fire again, 
swiftly, as she had often done at the 
turn of the year, she knew that it 
was too late. In the moment that the 
flame died, a gap had opened, wide 
enough to let in that which had long 
been held at bay. The drama must 
play itself out to its conclusion. 

A woman’s throaty yell came 
from behind her. She turned, not 
knowing if in answer to the call or 
in anticipation of what was destined 
for her. 

Time held for her as she surveyed 
the village. To her right, men 
pushed their heads out of doors, and 
women looked up from their work. 
To her left stood the Fearn. 



FEARN 



45 




There were few of them, perhaps 
a dozen or so, standing in the road 
clad in metal, with swords and 
spears upraised. Brit gasped in out- 
rage and fear. Jo, her slim, dark- 
haired half-sister, twisted fero- 
ciously in the grip of a scarred man 
with a grizzling of gray in his red- 
dened beard. 

One hand had ripped Jo’s robe 
from her shoulders and now 
grasped her about the waist. The 
other hand rested lightly on a 
shortsword at his hip. 

Jo fought for her life. As his 
great, hairy form bore down upon 
her, she clawed at his face, leaving 
a deep bloody welt. With a growl, 
he cuffed her sharply and her head 
fell back, limp. Hefting her dazed 
body, he made for one of the 
houses about the central square. 

Brit hurled herself foward, grab- 
bing up a stout log from the wood- 
pile. She swung it, two-handed, 
against the intruder’s back. He 
stopped, turning, letting Jo fall to 
the ground. She struck again, to the 
side of his face. 

He let out a bellow of rage, strik- 
ing the stick from her grasp. His 
sword came up, menancing. As he 
made a warning thrust, Brit sum- 
moned up power, sending a ward- 
ing against the blade, to turn it 
aside. 

It did not tum. 

The blade swung again, this time 
biting into her upraised arm. At the 
touch of the metal she felt a slow, 
cold poison began to seep into her. 
Her arm fell limp. 

She spoke an oath under her 
breath, calling on the Goddess to 
give her strength. Again she hurled 
the warding spell against him, to 

46 



stop his limbs, his heart. Though 
his muscles corded, he did not stop. 

A few of the villagers had 
gathered in a group. The leader 
turned to his men, gesturing with 
his sword. She could not understand 
his language, but the intent was 
clear. The Fearn moved without 
haste, swords raised. A yound man, 
red of hair, young, and naked to the 
waist, stepped forward, taking Brit 
by the arm in a grip of iron. She 
tried desperately to fight back, but 
her limbs would not move. 

The invaders gestured for the 
men of the group to step forward. 
One came docilely and was greeted 
with harsh laughter. A young war- 
rior forced him to his knees. He 
knelt. 

Another villager did not move. 
Swiftly he was dead, by a thrust in 
the chest. The Fearn chief roared a 
meaningless challenge to the villag- 
ers as he motioned his men to- 
ward one of the houses. 

A cry came from behind the in- 
vaders. A young woman in woolen 
breeches held a sickle against the 
throat of a young Fearn. 

Two of the warriors stepped for- 
ward, but the leader waved them 
back. They seemed glad to be 
halted, for they looked upon her 
with fear, unaccustomed to such 
boldness in a woman. 

The Fearn chieftain stepped for- 
ward alone. The young woman 
stepped back with her captive, wary 
but unafraid. He circled about her 
with sword extended. He lunged. 

The young warrior screamed, his 
throat opened. As he fell, the leader 
struck the woman with the flat of 
his blade. Brit fought against the 
young man who held her, and 

GALAXY 




against her own helplessness. It was 
a fell metal, indeed, to be proof 
against the power of the Goddess. 

A scene of unbridled carnage 
erupted as Brit watched. The 
women and men of the village met 
the invaders with pikes, hoes, 
staves, scythes, in desperate feroc- 
ity. Though slowed by their reluc- 
tance to fight with women, the 
Fearn were skilled murderers. In 
just a few short moments, her 
people were dead, in flight, or, like 
her, captured. 

The young red-headed man bent 
to pick her up. Summoning all her 
strength, she thrust herself from 
him. She must break free. The 
Priestess of the Goddess must at all 
costs remain undefiled. 

Though her arms and legs were 
deadened by the taint of the metal 
in her veins, she ran, heart pound- 
ing, for the shelter of the forest. 
She entered the shadowed dimness 
of the trees, hearing the crashing 
footfall of the man who pursued 
her. 

Suddenly, he was upon her, the 
disc of iarn about his neck pressing 
sharply into her flesh. The scent of 
his acrid body filled her nostrils, 
gagging her. He bent her to the 
damp soil of the forest floor. There 
was searing pain, and conscious- 
ness, with her vision, fled. 

* * * 

How long had she been dreaming 
here? Brit shuddered in the chill 
chve, shaking the memory from her. 
Soon they would come for her. 

For a moment Brit felt the horror 
of doubt. Why had She Who Made 
All Things forsaken her daughters 



and their sons? Perhaps there was, 
after all these years, war in heaven. 
Perhaps one of Her sons had turned 
upon his , Mother, claiming the 
earth, the sea and sky as his own. 
This Fearn in whose name the 
strangers swore their dark oaths 
called himself King of Kings, Lord 
of Hosts. His hosts had forced 
themselves upon the women of the 
village, upon the Priestess herself! 
Surely She would not allow such 
outrage. 

No, it was not She who had de- 
serted her daughters. It was they 
who had deserted Her, neglecting 
Her offices, and failing to be vigil- 
ant in the defense of Her honor. 

Reflexively Brit intoned a prayer 
of penitence. The calm of the ritual 
relaxed her. She gazed out again at 
the mournful, rain-soaked plain be- 
fore her. The Goddess wept. 

The new life within her stirred. 
She reached out with her mind to 
her unborn daughter, seeking to 
commune with her. This one, she 
knew, though not dark-haired like 
her mother, would have the witch 
sense too, if she lived to grow up to 
it to leam Her ways. 

When they came, Brit wondered, 
would they take her life im- 
mediately? Would they punish her 
for having fled when they grew lax 
in guarding her? Or would they 
make an example of her to the vil- 
lagers, of how even the Priestess of 
the Goddess was no match for their 
Flaming God? 

Brit trembled, not with cold this 
time, but with the presentiment of 
another vision. It was not a remem- 
brance like the others, but a pre- 
monition of what was to be. 

She saw herself in chains. Saw 



FEARN 



47 




herself — but how could that be? 
Who was there to do the seeing? 
Bands of iarn encircled her wrists, 
from which a chain joined her to a 
post. She still wore her white robes, 
though they were old and soiled. 

It was her village, but how it had 
changed. A fence encircled the cen- 
tral square where she was pilloried, 
and adults and children jeered at her 
as they passed. Those women who 
survived had yielded to their con- 
querors, becoming concubines rath- 
er than slaves. They were heavi- 
ily painted, and proudly wore bands 
of iarn at their wrists or on their 
fingers. The men had changed also. 
They had taken on the bold swag- 
gering ways of the Fearn, wearing 
tokens of the metal about their 
necks. 

But there had been other, graver 
changes. The shrine of the Goddess 
had been given over to the God, 
Fearn. It was forbidden to speak 
the name of the Goddess in public. 

As her vision continued, she saw 
the red-haired man who had taken 
her come to the post in the center 
square and unbind the collar from 
her neck, leading her away. 

Suddenly she understood a part of 
the vision. She saw through the 
eyes of her young daughter, the 
daughter bom in spring. So this was 
how she had survived, through the 
father who would not allow his 
child to be slain. Though called by 
some outlandish name, Brit had told 
her daughter, as soon as she was 
old enough to understand, that her 
True Name was Maeve. 

It was evening. The unearthly 
glow of the moon shone through the 
window of the house where Brit, 
her daughter, and the man lay in 

48 



stillness. Slowly, quietly, she drew 
herself to her feet, gently waking 
young Maeve, bidding her be quiet 
with gestures. 

She looked down at the naked 
man lying asleep in the moonlight. 
How easy it would be to pick up his 
sword and end his life before he 
woke, swiftly and silently. But Brit 
forebore the sword, instead gather- 
ing up a few possessions and steal- 
ing out into the moonlight and 
across the open fields. 

A sentry stood at the crossroads, 
leaning drowsily on his spear. Brit 
whispered a soft spell and his eyes 
dropped momentarily, allowing them 
to slip past. 

When they reached the forest, 
they began to run, swiftly as they 
could, not caring what noise they 
made now. At times it seemed as if 
Brit held the young Maeve in her 
arms over rough ground, and at 
times it seem that it was she, 
Brit, who was carried. 

At the top of a rise, they turned 
to look down upon the cluster of 
houses below. Brit’s face hardened 
at the thought of the defilement of 
Her shrine, at the arrogant and ser- 
vile ways of her people, and their 
terrible, false god. 

As they watched the sleeping 
town, Maeve’s hands began to 
weave in an eerie pattern, her voice 
to incant in an old, old spell she 
could not have known. Brit felt a 
thrill of dread. 

The roofs of the village began to 
blossom with a thousand buds of 
flame, which opened in awful 
glory. The red fire danced in 
Maeve’s eyes in a parody of inno- 
cence. What sort of child had she 
borne, Brit wondered, who turned 



GALAXY 




their fiery magic against them? 
They watched a moment longer in 
fascination, then were running 
again. 

The vision merged with reality. 
One moment Brit and her daughter 
were there in the cave, tending Her 
flame. The next, Brit was alone 
again, save for the life within her. 
Outside, men’s voices could be 
heard above the roar of the rain. 

Let them come , said a voice 
within her. The child must be born 
safely. 

She stepped to the mouth of the 
cave. A half-dozen men had seen 
the opening and were making their 
way up the rubble-strewn slopes. 

“There she is!” one shouted. 
“There’s the witch! She must be 
killed. While she lives. ...” 

The red-haired man in the lead 
raised his hand, regarding Brit’s 
swollen belly. “No!” he shouted. 
“That’s my child she carries! She is 
to be taken unharmed.” 

Brit stood still, reconciled. She 
took the disc she wore from about 
her neck, slipping it into a pocket 
of her robe. She would go with 
them for a time, allow herself to be 
reviled for the sake of the child she 
bore. One day she and Maeve 
would return to this place to carry 
on Her ways in exile, alone if need 
be. What matter if it took a 
thousand years, or two thousand? So 
long as the spaik was kept alive. 
Her spirit could not die. 

Brit extended her arms to the 
man before her, allowing him to 
fasten the bracelets of fearn about 
her wrists. She lifted her head 
proudly, as a Priestess of the Great 
Goddess must, and began the long 
journey down into the valley. ★

WILL THERE BE STARS IN OUR CROWN? 



1 know i do a lot of conference 
reports, but 1 get to a lot of confer- 
ences, and they’re generally pretty 
fascinating, so why shouldn’t I 
write about them? At any rate, the 
latest was the Goddard Memorial 
Symposium held by the American 
Astronautical Society; as an added 
attraction AAS was co-sponsor, 
with its German counterpart (which 
is itself the successor to the old Ve- 
rein fur Raumschiffart, of which my 
predecessor Willy Ley was vice pres- 
ident, so there’s another reason 
why I cannot ignore it). 

One of the speakers was myself: I 
was given the “eye-opener” session 
at 0830 which I was told was a 
compliment (if you can’t wake ’em 
up, Pournelle, nobody can, said the 
session chairman). There was also a 
panel consisting of myself, ex- 
GALAXY editor Jim Baen, writers 
Karl Pflock and Tom Monteleone, 
and former astronaut Dr. Brian 



O’Leary. The staid old AAS is get- 
ting positively sciencefiction- 
conventionish in its style, possibly 
because the Vice President of AAS 
this year is Dr. Charles Sheffield 
whose work you’ve seen in 

GALAXY and now elsewhere. 

There were also a number of 
European engineers and scientists 
reporting on SPACELAB, which is 
the research module that inserts into 
the shuttle, and which may be the 
salvation of our space program. 
Surely the Shuttle would not survive 
without it. 

I say that not in mere admiration 
of the Europeans' work; although it 
is admirable enough I suspect that 
Boeing or Rockwell or McDonnell- 
Douglas or Grumman or some 
other U.S. aerospace firm could 
have done the job: no, we may 
have SPACELAB to thank for the 
shuttle because I suspect that if it were 
not for the considerable intema- 



50 



GALAXY 



tional flap that would result, our 
administration would cancel the Shut- 
tle entirely. 

After all, they’ve killed Enter- 
prise; and while I was in 
Washington I heard they were try- 
ing to kill off the Vandenberg shut- 
tle launches; which means no polar 
orbit launches with any considerable 
payload (you can go at a high incli- 
nation out of Florida but at cost of 
much-reduced payload) and that 
means the Air Force won’t have 
many missions for Shuttle after all, 
and with the military funding much 
of the civilian research would go, 
and when that was cancelled some- 
one would decide that there were no 
real missions for Shuttle (“Look at 
how little they plan to do with it. 
We can get all that done with 
surplus Titan boosters”) and — but 
you can finish the scenario for 
yourself. 

Fortunately, though, our Euro- 
pean allies have spent some real 
bucks of their own money on 
SPACELAB and they’d raise a con- 
siderable howl if we decided at this 
late date to leave them hung out to 
dry. Deo Gratia. 

Excuse my gloom. The confer- 
ence was, by contrast, quite satisfy- 
ing. Once again 1 heard paper after 
paper proving that we can do the 
job. The question is — will we? Be- 
cause we can certainly afford to. If 
your system is to ship $50 billion a 
year and more off to the Middle 
East, you can afford any research 
and development that has even a 
small chance of paying off: and 
space research has got a lot more 
going for it than that. 

Provided, of course, that we 
don’t get bogged down with the 



wierd philosophy of “soft” energies 
that seems to pervade Washington. 
At the moment I was giving my talk 
on space industrialization to some 
of the directors and technical staff 
of the National Science Foundation, 
the President was entertaining a 
chap who detests “big, hard” 
energy systems; he wants lots of 
“soft” systems which are decen- 
tralized, locally operated and, above 
all, labor intensive. Labor intensive 
means, I presume, that I shall have 
my choice of forking up my home 
bio-mass methane generator myself 
or trying to find someone who’ll do 
it for money I can afford. I’ll prob- 
ably have no choice about my 
home windmill and gas lights, and 
the actual methane extractors, but 
surely hiring the maintenance on 
those will be no problem: no more 
difficult than, say, getting a reliable 
automobile mechanic or TV repair- 
man. 



★ ★ ★ 

Probably the best paper at the 
A AS symposium was that of 
Charles Gould, Advanced Systems 
Product Manager for the Space Di- 
vision of Rockwell (what used to be 
North American). Gould presented a 
systems study of space industrializa- 
tion benefits, which, I am sure it 
comes as no surprise, he finds far 
oughtweigh the costs — or, for that 
matter, the costs of not going to 
space; and there' are many. 

Start with some obvious facts: 
there are a lot of people in this 
world. They’d like to buy things 
from us. They don’t have much to 
buy with (unless they’ve got oil). 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



51 




Thus, in cold cash terms, world 
poverty deprives us of a potential 
market of two billion people, or 
several hundred billions of dollars 
worth of exports — more than 
enough to balance our payments and 
stabilize the plummeting dollar. 

And therefore it is in our simple 
economic interest, as well as chari- 
table, that we plan our future in a 
way that makes other people rich 
while benefitting ourselves. 

Make no mistake: we have to do 
something. President Carter has in 
his short time in office already ex- 
ceeded the balance-of-payments de- 
ficits of all his predecessors from 
Washington to Nixon combined, 
and things don’t seem to be getting 
much better. (In fact as I write this 
I’m suddenly more impressed by 
my overseas book sales. Guilders 
and florens and francs and pounds 
and yen look pretty good. Even lira 
look better, and you know you’re in 
trouble when the lira looks 
good. .) 

The Rockwell study was incredi- 
bly detailed. They began with sev- 
eral views of the future: the Donella 
Meadows “Limits to Growth” 
thesis, Herman Kahn’s “Ingenuity 
of Man” hypothesis, and Krafft 
Ehricke’s “Extraterrestrial Impera- 
tive.” The latter is probably closest 
to the view I have supported in this 
column: we can break free of think- 
ing of the world as a limited and 
isolated unit. 

Selling such a viewpoint is no 
easy task. Dr. Stefan Possony and I 
have been engaged in a long-term 
study of technology and philosophy 
(our first effort along those lines re- 
sulted in a book. The Strategy of 
Technology, which I’m pleased to 



say is still in print after eight years) 
and one major fact stands out: 
world philosophy has always been 
concerned with rather narrowly 
limits. How could it be otherwise? 
From Aristotle to Marx, the great 
philosophers have been dealing with 
a universe they did not understand. 
They didn’t even know how many 
stars there are! 

This is a point worth emphasiz- 
ing. For a very long time it has 
been clear to thoughtful people that 
there is a limit to growth — and a 
rather finite limit to what the Earth 
can support. Thus the very basis of 
Western though has been influenced 
by considerations of limits. Yet it is 
not very obvious that this view is 
correct: certainly it is not correct 
unless extremely long time spans, 
millions and millions of years, be 
considered. It is easy enough to see 
how the ancients — and in a moment 
you’ll see that some “moderns” de- 
serve to be classed with the 
ancients — inevitably adopted this 
view. Furthermore, given that most 
world leaders are lawyers, and of 
the others most have had a classical 
rather than a scientific education, it 
is not hard to understand why the 
limits philosophy has such a hard 
time of it. 

Example: to this day, we mostly 
think in terms of “nature’s 
bounty,” with “nature” being 
though kind and benevolent. Yet a 
moment’s thought convinces us 
otherwise. Nature is. not kind com- 
pared to a Kansas wheat farm, or to 
pennicilin. Civilized man has never 
relied on nature: the closest to that 
was perhaps ancient Egypt as “gift 
of the Nile,” and even there the 
Nile was helped along with exten- 



52 



GALAXY 




sive canals and other massive hy- 
draulic projects. Yet — “bountiful na- 
ture” pervades our literature and 
our religions. (One need not go the 
other way and assume that man 
makes himself: there is plenty to be 
thankful for; and Western religion 
has not found it strange that God 
helps those who help themselves). 

My point is that until the 1920’s 
we did not know of other “island 
universes;” we had no concept of 
how large was the universe in 
which we live. Until this century 
we didn’t know how many elements 
there were. We had no idea of the 
number of atomic particles, or how 
long the sun will/can last, how 
many forces there are in nature (we 
still don’t know that for certain). 

Much of our philosophy of life 
was old at the time of the French 
Revolution — which is when electri- 
city was discovered. Plasmas and 
ions, the “fourth state of matter” 
and matter’s most plentiful form, 
were unknown when Marx and En- 
gels and Lenin hammered out their 
plans. Enzymes were discovered in 
1907, vitamins at about the turn of 
the century. 

As Possony says in a recent 
paper, “As much key events are 
listed at random, it is clear very few 
of them had visible impact on polit- 
ical thinking or upon our concept of 
the world.” 

Thus, in my judgment, the impor- 
tance of studies like Gould’s for 
Rockwell: analyses of future options 
that try to break free of traditional 
thinking, and look at both limited 
and unlimited opportunities. 

The study considered six program 
options, which are listed in Table 
One. The last one, “level of ef-

TABLE ONE: SIX PROGRAM 
OPTIONS 



o Immediate Crisis-Oriented Program 

Sacrifice nothing for a better tomorrow: things are too 
bad already. Go for near-term gains. 

o Foresight: Optimize over next 30 years. 

Confidence in future, but need to cope with balance of 
payments, energy, etc. 

o Reaction: Little Ice Age 

Assumes valid the data indicating we may be returning 
to colder climates and shorter growing seasons; uses 
space investment to mitigate effects on the US and 
world. 

o International Space Program: 

Cooperation in space to foster world peace. Widespread 
participation and sharing of space exploitation. 

o Geosynchronous Market Leadership: 

Capture the burgeoning and probably very lucrative in- 
formation market for the US. Stay ahead of the competi- 
tion 

o Budget-Based Program 

Level-of-effort budget to keep the program and 
capabilities alive, but emphasis is on preserving options, 
not immediate exploitation. 



fort,” is closest to the present U.S. 
situation; the first, “crisis reaction” 
appears to be where we are now 
moving. 

They then looked at different 
time frames and folded in other var- 
iables, so that as Gould puts it, 
“By the time you consider six pro- 
gram philosophies, 60 oppor- 
tunities, three ratings of importance, 
and five ratings of rate — all divided 
into five time frames — you need to 
make about- 5,000 decisions. We 
made these and exposed at least 100 
persons to the results in complicated 
reports and extended working group 
sessions.” 



Contrast this with the way deci- 
sions are made in Washington! 

During the study they came up 
with over 200 space opportunities 
(60 were used in the study itself). 
These break down into categories as 
shown in Table Two. 

They then examined space indus- 
tries: products and energy. Each one 
needs a discussion in detail. In the 
study summary one is used as an 
example: urokinase. This is a 

catalytic substance which prevents 
blood clots; it can dissolve small 
blood clots. Some people take aspi- 
rin to achieve the same effect of pre- 
venting congestive heart failure

TABLE TWO: OPPORTUNITIES 
IN SPACE 



o Communications 

Direct TV; Meteorological information; personal com- 
munications; printing systems; disaster warnings; per- 
sonal computing access. 

o Navigation and Tracking 

Search and rescue; wildlife and marine animal tracking; 
traffic control (air and sea); rail anti-collision system; 
UN truce observation satellite. 

o Land Data 

Forest management, land management, pollution 
monitoring, hydrological information resource manage- 
ment, mapping, snowfall, water basin contents, irrigation 
flow return, runoff forecasts, etc. etc. etc. 

o Weather Data 

o Ocean Data 

Oil spill, shoreline ocean current, algae bloom measure- 
ments . 

o Global Environment 

Glacier movement and growth, highway environment 
impact, tectonic plate observation 

o Budget-Based Program 

Level-of-effort budget to keep the program and 
capabilities alive, but emphasis is on preserving options, 
not immediate exploitation. 



and stroke, but aspirin clearly has 
side effects and is hardly optimum; 
urokinase might have a major im- 
pact on human life were it available 
in quantities. It isn’t, at the mo- 
ment, because it must be separated 
from urine, about a ton of urine 
going to make up one dose of 
urokinase. 

SKYLAB and ASTP experiments 
found that urokinase cells can be 
separated rapidly and with high pur- 
ity in the space environment, and 
that the cells can produce urokinase 



much faster in space than on Earth. 
By the mid 1980’s space factories 
could make this substance available 
on a mass basis — provided, of 
course, that we construct the facil- 
ity. 

I have already mentioned energy 
from space. The study looked into 
Solar Power Satellites, “Soletta” 
(mirrors to put more sunlight onto 
selected places on Earth, either to 
aid ground-based solar energy col- 
lectors, or to prevent frost and in- 
crease agrigultural yields).

“Lunetta” (artificial moons to light 
cities at night) and a raft of other 
options, all certainly feasible. 

The Gould study also looked at 
cutting tools, other pharmaceuticals, 
optical glasses for lasers, fiber op- 
tics, magnets, uniform crystals, 
long-life x-ray targets, turbine 
blades, hollow ball bearings, and a 
whole raft of other potential pro- 
ducts. They went through a 
number of iterations to look at con- 
figurations of space industrial 
facilities. 

1 suppose it comes as no surprise 
that the study conclusions are favor- 
able to space development; it is also 
no surprise that a number of “soft 
energy” and “friends of the envi- 
ronment” groups will continue to 
oppose space development. And a 
final non-surprise: those who op- 
pose space will not have anything 
like this study to support their 
views, although I am sure they can 
and will take pot-shots at this re- 
port. 

But the potential is there in 
space; it is easily provable. 

Another speaker: Frederick Os- 
borne, Jr., of the Hudson River 
Conservation Society. His group is 
definitely “concerned;” it has been 
among those responsible for pre- 
venting the Storm King pumped- 
storage reservoir proposed over the 
last decade and more. Mr. Osbome 
was in Washington not to oppose 
the reservoir (although he does) but 
to propose an alternative: a solar 
power satellite, with antenna farms 
off the south shore of Long Island. 
It wouldn’t cost all that much more 
than what the power companies 
want to do now — and it would, he 
says, be kinder to the environment. 



Furthermore, Osborne said, “it is 
the historic mission of government 
to explore the new frontier, build 
roads to it, and to protect the early 
settlers. Space is our only feasible 
new frontier, and it is incumbent on 
the government to provide access to 
it.” 

That’s an interesting way of put- 
ting it; and very accurate. Lewis 
and Clark; Fremont; Zebulon Pike; 
Jefferson Davis’ “camel corps,” 
the frontier army; transcontinental 
railroads— all these were govern- 
ment activities opening up the fron- 
tier for the citizens. One can hardly 
argue that there is no precedent. 

And my own point: that we can 
all conceive ways to make profits in 
space. The problem is that we are 
not sure that any one activity will 
support the entire establishment. In 
addition to the direct costs of space 
industry there are the general costs, 
housekeeping, life support, station- 
keeping, and the like. 

Thus the proposal of Jim Baen 
and myself: that the U.S. ought to 
operate highways to space, cer- 
tainly; and it ought to become a 
landlord. Construct a space indus- 
trial park and rent out facilities. 
There would be takers. Many of 
them. If the enterprise does not ac- 
tually make profits, it certainly will 
recover much of the cost. 

In fact — except for the space pro- 
gram, what successes has govern- 
ment had in the past quarter cen- 
tury? 

But as I write they’re cutting the 
program. 

After all, we live in an era of 
limits. Hasn’t this been clear to our 
intellectual leaders for a very long 
time? How could the great thinker 



56 



GALAXY 




of all time be wrong? 

Of course the Victorians thought 
the sun ran off oxidation, and didn’t 
even know the full potential of coal; 
Marx knew nothing of modem ag- 
riculture or industry; the computer 
was unknown even in concept; 
galaxies were thought to be nebul- 
ous balls of gas; x-rays were play- 
things in obscure laboratories; 
radio-activity was an inexplicable 
phenomenon; biochemistry was not 
even an infant science — in other 
words, at the time our fundamental 
philosophies were generated, nearly 
all the discoveries that affect your 
life were not merely unknown, but 
impossible in principle. 

Technology and engineering 
drove society and transformed the 
world. The Great Thinkers of All 
Time had nothing to say about that; 
so their descendants, intelligentsia 
trained in classical thought, denig- 
rated engineering. Instead of de- 
veloping a world view appropriate 
to the modern era, we were given 
reasons why the engineers were 
mere “Babbits,” bourgeois, in- 
tellectually contemptible. It was far 
more respectable to study Marx and 
Aristotle than to enroll in calculus. 
Recall the terrible flap over granting 
a degree in science that almost tore 
Harvard apart? Of course you do 
not; but men now living can re- 
member it. 

Our government institutions grew 
from an entirely different world: 
witness the complexity of the Gould 
study, which is hardy unprecedented 
(I was involved in a similar effort 
back in the 60’s, and there have 
been plenty of others) and compare 
that to the way laws are made. 

Interestingly enough, the Con- 



stitutional Framers set up a system 
more able to react to advances in 
the sciences, more able to deal with 
new ideas, than the system we have 
now. They knew they didn’t know 
everything; and their intent was to 
have a Congress of citizens, of 
diverse views; a government service 
composed of citizens whose career 
was not in government (witness Jef- 
ferson calling the presidency 
“splendid misery,” and J. Q. 
Adams believing his most important 
work was a report on weights and 
measures and standards). A 
government dominated by lawyers 
turned professional politician was 
hardly what Adams, Hamilton, Jay, 
Madison, Franklin, and the others 
had in mind. 

Moreover, although study of the 
Constitutional debates shows a re- 
verence for history — they discussed 
the English revolution, the Venetian 
Republic, Rome, Parthia, Aristotles 
“Constitutions” and much that is 
incomprehensible to moderns not 
steeped ip the classics — you will 
also find a curious awareness that 
“a new age now begins;” a sense 
that there was a complete break 
with the past, that new data were 
needed, that the experience of the 
past was useful only up to a certain 
point. You will also find a sense of 
potential that we seem to have lost. 

And yet — their glorious future 
was based only on the belief that 
man’s potential, shorn of the dead 
weight of government, was much 
greater than anyone had supposed. 

What might they have made of 
the implications of a study like 
Gould’s? 

What might we? 

And what will we? ★

EDITORIAL MATTERS 



you’ve been exposed to 
arguments pro and con by Harlan 
Ellison and Richard Geis over the 
merits of making the world science 
fiction convention a sounding board 
for the Equal Rights Amendment. 

By the time you read this, Harlan 
may be sounding forth from his tent 
(or, given the temperature in 
Phoenix, his air-conditioned 
Winnebago); Phyllis Schlaffly may 
have shown up to picket the 
convention;) and several thousand 
fans — if they’re typical fans — will 
probably be ignoring both of them. 

Not that fans are necessarily 
either insensitive or reactionary: it’s 
just that business is business and 
fun is fun. Last year, some Leading 
Lights of science fiction promoted a 
boycott of the world convention in 
Miami Beach because of Anita 
Bryant and her campaign against 
homosexuals. Said Leading Lights 
were conspicuous by their absence. 
Conspicuous by their presence were 
gay sf fans, who wore pink 
nametags, placed an ad in the 
program book, hosted parties — and 
shared a good time with the straight 
fans. 

People aren’t likely to notice 
impassioned speeches made at sf 
conventions. But they’ll notice how 
science fiction fans act — 

at conventions and, much more 
importantly, in every day life. If 
we’re going to “walk the walk,” 

58 



it’s more important to do it 365 
days a year in the world than four 
days in August at a hotel in 
Phoenix . 

* * * 

To further lengthen an already 
overlong story — and in belated fair- 
ness to the Iguanacon com- 
mittee — we should point out that it 
was Ellison’s own decision to make 
an issue of the ERA in Phoenix, 
and that nothing in his statement 
should be construed to mean that he 
has the official endorsement or en- 
couragement of the convention 
committee. 

★ * * 

Most of you don’t go to 
conventions, or read the fan press; 
so you may not know about the 
death of Leigh Brackett. But you all 
read science fiction, so you know 
what a great loss to the field this 
has been. 

Leigh was the widow of Edmond 
Hamilton, himself one of the all 
time greats; and she had taken his 
death hard. She had suffered from 
cancer for some time, but — a 
professional to the end — kept herself 
going to complete the screenplay for 
Star Wars II (The latest word from 
Star Wars Corporation is that her 
treatment will be used, with any 

GALAXY 




revisions kept to the bare minimum 
required by location shot decisions, 
etc.) 

If you haven’t read The Coming 
of the Terrans, or The Long 
Tomorrow, or The Best of Leigh 
Brackett in a while, go back to 
them soon. And don’t forget her 
movie collaboration with William 
Faulkner, The Big Sleep — it’s 
probably still on late night TV, and 
the recent remake is a turkey 
anyway. Leigh was some writer, 
and not just of science fiction. 

* * * 

Frederik Pohl is some writer too, 
only he’s very much alive. And 
he’ll be bringing GALAXY alive 
next month with the first installment 
of his latest novel, Jem. 

Like practically everything Fred 
writes, it is a gem. A huge one, 
too; it’s going to take up five 
issues — about 120,000 words in all, 
but none of them wasted. And when 
next year’s Hugo nominations roll 
around. 

Fred’s always been known as a 
satirist, all the way back to The 
Space Merchants (with C.M. 
Kornbluth, serialized in these pages 
25 years ago). More discerning 
readers have noticed that he can 
write “hard” science fiction with 
the best — didn’t he out-Niven Larry 
Niven with “The Merchants of 
Venus?” 

Jem is a hard science fiction 
novel. It’s also a satirical novel. It’s 
also about the making of a 
Utopia — sort of. Jem is a planet — a 
planet unlike any other you’ve ever 
read about, and one realized with as 
much loving attention to detail as 
any by Hal Clement. It has three 

EDITORIAL 



native cultures, each of them 
fascinating. 

It also has, lately, us. The sort of 
people who sell Feckle Freezers to 
each other when they aren’t clubbing 
each other down here on Earth. Jem 
seems to be our only hope — our 
only hope. How other intelligent 
life forms may feel about the matter 
is something else again. 

Jem — watch for it.

Gregory Benford 




Ling Sanjen has followed a 
career as an officer in Fleet, the 
military arm of the vast interstellar 
empire man has forged by faster- 
than-light ships (Jump ships ) and 
the slower ramscoop vessels. Ling 
is an ofkaipan — a despised outsider 
in the predominantly Mongol cul- 
ture, a synthesis of Chinese, 
Japanese and southeast Asian 
societies. This is all that remains of 
the human race; the other nations 
were wiped out in the Riot War. 

Ling is one of the first Fleet 
officers to come into contact with a 
strange new disorder, the Plague. It 
is a crushing fear of open spaces 
and light, apparently brought on by 
an alien species, the Quarn. A full- 
scale war develops between Fleet 
and the Quarn, but so little is 
known of the enemy that fleet is vir- 
tually powerless. No Quarn native 
worlds are known. Ling makes the 
first raid to bring back survivors of 
a Quarn “ attack ” on the planet 
Regeln. On Regeln Ling finds 
people crowded into foul pas- 
sageways and self-made piles of 
mud and stone, erected to shield out 
the enormity of open space. The 
survivors are gibbering, mindless 
cases. 

Ling’s men evacuate some sur- 
vivors. Returning to Earth, the crew 
itself begins to develop Plague-like 
symptoms. The clearest sign of this 
is the failure of the Sabal Game, an 
elaborate public ritual the Empire 
has made a virtual state religion. 
The Game reinforces social solidar- 
ity and feelings of group coopera- 
tion. To Ling, Sabal is an important 
emotional factor in his life, the un- 
derpinning to his ability to lead. He 
leads his ship’s Sabal Game on the 



flight Earthward and the Game dis- 
solves into strife and self-seeking 
among the players — exactly the op- 
posite of what the Game should 
achieve. 

Ling sees now that the Game is 
the key to the Quarn assault on 
man. The mysterious Plague 
spreads through the Game, using 
man’s psychological weaknesses 
against him. Ling decides not to 
bring the survivors to Earth. Ling’s 
executive officer, Tonji, brushes 
aside these ideas. He invokes a 
Fleet rule against Ling and brings 
the ship to Earth. Ling is court- 
martialed for delaying the return of 
the survivors, which Fleet wanted to 
examine. An ofkaipan, he is quickly 
convicted. Only Ling sees that these 
survivors will spread the illness on 
Earth; but he is ignored. By this 
time the disease has affected him, 
too, and then his family. 

For a long year he lives in de- 
spair with his wife, Angela, and his 
children Chark and Romana. They 
live in the Slots, cramped buildings 
housing the ill. But gradually Ling 
recovers, for unknown reasons. He 
ventures out of the Slots and is 
picked up by a Fleet guard. Fleet is 
interested in recovery cases and 
after studying him they offer him his 
old rank. Tonji himself offers a post 
on the planet Veden. Barely sup- 
pressing his hatred of Tonji, Ling 
accepts. Angela protests his leaving 
Earth but Ling goes anyway, drawn 
by the urge to act. 

Tonji’ s offer was a barbed one. 
Veden is in a double-star system. 
There is a hot blue star, Lekki, and 
circling it a neutron star, Jagen. 
The precious Jump ships are no 
longer used to drop passengers 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

safely near Veden; instead, Ling 
must loop near Jagen, losing energy 
through a gravitational slingshot 
effect, to reach Veden. He sur- 
vives-barely-and resolves to • settle 
the score someday with Tonji. 

Or i Veden he must have his eyes 
fitted with special contact lenses 
and wear protective robes, to avoid 
Lekki’s ultraviolet light. His junior 
officers, Gharma and Majumbdahr, 
are representative of Veden — the 
sole planet founded by the Indian 
culture of Old Earth. Ling is given 
a luxurious home as local Fleet Dir- 
ector. The Lekki-Jagen system is 
Fleet’s stockpile. Ramscoop vessels 
orbit the two stars. When they are 
bought by a distant planet Veden 
Control fires their engines and 
drops them through the gravita- 
tional slingshot (the Flinger), 
launching them into interstellar 
space at high velocities. This cuts 
the transit time for interstellar 
commerce, making possible the 
economic empire. 

As Ling approaches his new 
house a winged man swoops down 
from the twilight sky and tries to 
assassinate him. Such violence is 
unknown on Veden. Does it mark 
the beginning of the Plague here as 
well? 

■ Ling relaxes into the slower pace 
of Veden society. But rioting and 
dissension begin in Kalic, the capi- 
tal city, and Plague cases crop up. 
As pressure mounts Ling begins an 
affair with a girl who was injured 
in a riot, Rhandra. He feels some 
guilt about this and dreams of his 
family, trapped back on Earth, but 
memories of Angela cannot erase 
the realities of his growing love for 
Rhandra. 



Majumbdahr becomes a good 
friend. Gharma is a reliable officer 
but betrays a touch of ruthlessness. 
Rhandra leads Ling to a new 
spiritual Master who has a growing 
following, the only stable social in- 
fluence in the gathering chaos of 
the Plague. Sitting in the simple 
rituals. Ling suddenly experiences a 
new lofting sensation, a rippling of 
lights, and attains enlightenment. 

But the greatest revelation of all 
awaits him at his next meeting with 
the Master. 

9 

The master loomed above me. 
He filled the room, the whole uni- 
verse. Warm close feel of Rhandra 
beside me, sweet air of incense, 
sticky pull of robes on my flesh — all 
fell away into nothing. 

I focused on the Master. As I slid 
into it, I asked What state is this? 
and almost before the question had 
formed, I felt the peace begin. Rip- 
ples of worry smoothed and van- 
ished. A state of no definition, no 
thought, no method. To put aside 
the thousand things and, in stillness, 
retain yourself. 

“This is done by not thinking 
various things, one after another,” 
the Master said, his deep rolling 
voice breaking a long silence. 

I laughed. Sound to the side: soft 
tinkling chuckle of Rhandra. 

“Like — that,” I said, abruptly 
snapping my fingers. It was very 
clear what ne meant. Just — that. No 
words. Only being. 

The Master nodded. 

“There is more,” he said. 
“Many things you must know. Not 
as they seem.” 



62 



GALAXY 




I waved a hand in question, laid 
my head upon my shoulder. The 
Master moved his body to shield his 
hand. I glimpsed a small sliver of 
metal, a box. He fingered it rhyth- 
mically. I heard a low smooth tone 
that died away as I concentrated. A 
strange prickly shock ran down my 
neck. I was falling. What — ? 

Coming back again. I expanded 
until I could see myself below. 
Deep white craters that were pores 
on my face. I shivered in the hur- 
ricane that swept down from the 
nostril mountain. 

— You can be close. Warm. 
Gather once more into the lap of 
sunlight — 

The Master said that, but with no 
words. I started to tum my head 
toward Rhandra and stopped, fixed 
in the Master’s stare. Mosaics of 
light swept through us. I saw 
Gharma and Majumbdahr standing 
to both sides of the Master. They 
must have entered from behind the 
folds of ruby cloth and stood quietly 
in place until my attention was fo- 
cused on them. 

— quit of their tasks. You were 
not ready for me. It was in the 
place of rightness that you learned 
Veden first, felt what happens here, 
saw the signs of fresh ruin — 

Majumbdahr grinned wryly at me. 
I felt a sudden burst of affection for 
this man who had worked and 
planned beside me and at all times 
sensed my inner turmoil. I owed 
him much. 

Uharma gazed at me calmly. His 
heavy lids shadowed his dark eyes, 
adapted for Veden and holding 
something forever unknowable. He 
was a strange, deep man moved by 
traditions and social conventions I 



would never fully grasp. His dis- 
tance I respected. And he too had 
helped me. 

— Look now — 

The Master stood in one smooth 
motion. He twisted two spots in his 
robes and they fell away. But for a 
swath at his waist he was naked. 

Thin, wiry. Long bones moved in 
his arms and legs, rippling the taut, 
pale white skin. His seven fingers 
were like sticks with large knobby 
joints. A barrel chest. No body 
hair. 

His feet were dark semicircles of 
thick, tough fiber spanned by radial 
ridges of cartiledge, like toes. 

His eyes were deep and black. 
The mouth curved upward in a thin 
red line. There was no nose. 

A translucent wedge of tissue jut- 
ted out where ears would have 
been. He stood, rocking slightly on 
the wide base of his feet. 

Silence seeped among us. 

He was an alien. 

The body was unlike anything I 
knew among the races within the 
Mongul Empire. Even those races 
were seldom allowed to leave their 
home stars, so there was little 
chance that one would appear on 
Veden. 

I looked at the Master for long 
moments. I could not fear him. 

In a way, this was the answer I 
had been seeking. The two threads 
of my life were entwined at last. 

The Master was a Quam. 

★ ★ ★ 

It took two days, and some of it 
wasn’t words at all. 

Like all intelligent races, they 
came out of nothingness, armed 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



63 




with their own peculiar insights and 
talents. 

There had been another Empire, 
then. Far mightier than that of the 
Mongul, comprising many more 
races. It had already begun to de- 
cline when the Quam were young. 

Other races ebbed into lassitude 
and death. The Empire came apart 
from sheer lack of interest. Yet the 
Quam lived on; their time was not 
yet come. In the dying embers of 
that Empire they had learned much. 
Through the long centuries that fol- 
lowed they hoarded their knowledge 
and studied. 

Finally age caught up with even 
them. The spirit drained slowly 
away, as they had seen happen to 
others. The artifacts of their 
forefathers remained but not the will 
to build more or to improve upon 
the old. 

Then came Man. The Mongul 
Empire licked at the edge of the 
Quam life sphere. The wisest 
among the Quam, who had studied 
the history of the earlier Empire, 
recognized some of the same 
symptoms. 

Man dominated every other race 
and culture he met. He suppressed 
minorities within his own civiliza- 
tion. It was easy to see why the 
Mongul Empire had expanded so 
rapidly. The history of Man was the 
history of cycles. A continual ten- 
sion existed between Man the social 
animal and Man the individualist. 
Stress on one aspect or another os- 
cillated slowly through the gradual 
upward climb toward a world cul- 
ture. The Asian continent was the 
last local area in which the virtues 
of community dominated. When vir- 
tually all the human race outside of 



pockets on the Asian mainland was 
destroyed in the Riot War, this 
cycle was disturbed. Asia rose to 
dominance. Simultaneously, Man 
achieved the technology to reach the 
stars. 

The Mongul Empire expanded 
outward on a wave of psychic 
energy released by the melding of 
the entire human race into one 
community. 

But Man was not meant fully for 
community. The duality of his na- 
ture was the ultimate source of his 
resilience and his strength. The 
Mongul Empire had to fail. 

When the Quam first met it, the 
Empire had begun to slow down 
and become formalized. Given 
time, the formalities would chafe. 
Rebellion would bring harsh mea- 
sures. The Empire would begin to 
split. 

The best way to avoid revolution 
at home was war abroad. It was 
part of a classic pattern. The Quam 
saw that the leaders of the Mongul 
Empire would find it profitable to 
disturb the peace of the surrounding 
races when they met them. The 
basic instability of the Empire 
would expend , itself on other, more 
stable cultures. 

The Quam had studied Man for 
long centuries before deciding on a 
course of action. They would have 
to force Man back upon his origins, 
rid him of the Empire that would 
eventually crush him. They would 
use his own weaknesses against 
him — the only mature way to wage 
war between radically different cul- 
tures. 

They pieced together ships that 
could barely survive in combat with 
Empire forces. It was the most they 



64 



GALAXY 




could do with the decaying technol- 
ogy they possessed. The ancient 
Quam had left giant devices in free 
space which could perform enor- 
mous tasks — move a planet through 
Jump space, damp the bright fire of 
suns — but these the Quam could not 
morally use in battle, for a simple 
clash of arms would not add a new 
factor to the human equation. They 
used what ships they could mend 
and make serviceable by them- 
selves . plus what they knew of 
the human mind. 

“But we erred,” the Master 
murmured. 

His voice, after so long a time 
without words, came as low thun- 
der. “How?” I whispered. 

“We meant only to disturb 
Empire — ” A vision, here, of a 
new wind stirring human wheat — 
“Allow time for self-study. It slips 
from us, now.” The Master’s face 
drew down, the eyes grew gray. 

“You did not think it could go so 
far?” Majumbdahr said. 

“No. Some of us have 
. walked to the darkness in pay- 
ment. For us, the ultimate crime 
against the race. To relieve oneself 
of life.” 

“Is it too late? Can’t . ” 
Rhandra’s quiet urgency faded as 
she saw the look that swept over the 
Master’s face. 

“The sickness ran deep.” Dry 
leaves crackled inside his chest. 
“So many ...” 

“Can’t we, can’t we save you?” 
I said. 

He pierced me with a pale 
glance. “Perhaps. I leam your lan- 
guage only now. I am ... a meas- 
urer, not one who acts. I come to 
Veden in secret, as we do to all 



worlds. That is how the . cure, 
which became a death ... is 
spread. We thought we knew you 
so well. It was an arrogance. When 
this is done, I shall . walk.” 
“No!” I cried. 

“I come on this journey, to eam 
it.” 

“I’ve seen enough of death,” I 
said. 

“You will see more.” 

“Why?” 

“I cannot stop it. I tried.” 

“If the Empire quit Sabal al- 
together. ?” 

“The firestorm burns of itself. 
The ember which began it is con- 
sumed.” 

“Then there’s nothing to do.” 
“There remains a task.” 

“What is it?” My voice was clot- 
ted, blurred. 

“There are some who rebirthed. 
You are such.” 

“Survived the Plague? True, I 
did, but ...” 

“Because you are . ofkaipan. 
More than that, we know not why, 
but something more. A fragment of 
your race will survive. I did not un- 
derstand this when first you came. 
My first sin came then.” 

“Sin?” 

“A man, out of the sky.” 

“The assassin?” 

“I spoke of you. A follower, too 
turbulent in himself ...” 

“Tried to kill me? Why?” 

“I thought you carried the 
Plague.” 

“We told him of you,” Gharma 
put in. “We thought your recovery 
was temporary, and you would in- 
fect Veden. The Master became 
concerned. But we never in- 
tended ...”

“You see? We know you poorly. 
Arrogance.” 

“A foreboding in the Master be- 
came the deed of a follower,” 
Majumbdahr said quietly. “I 
learned only later.” 

For a while we sat in silence. 

“A wind now blows through the 
Quam,” the Master said distantly. 
“Something . drawing thin.” 

We waited. There was a calm 
still silence in the room. The Mas- 
ter’s thin frame trembled. 

“We . thought the only hope 
of saving many humans ...” The 
words came out as though under 
pressure. “ . was to isolate a 
world from the Plague. Ved- 
en . was good. Hard to 
reach ... by your fast ships.” 
“Jump ships.” 

The trembling was very slight. 
There was a tangible layered chill in 
the air. 

“I thought to . kill you ... a 
thought of a moment. But it was 
done. It came from my hand.” 

“I . ” 

The tension in the Master muted. 
“I have moved far from my Path. 
The wind, the unstable wind of the 
mind that blows through us ... I 
am in and of it, now. I ... the 
Path ... I will Walk.” 

A time passed then and the 
thought came into my mind of rain, 
endless rain in the Philippine town I 
had lived in as a boy. A warm wind 
brought heavy drops that stripped 
the leaves from some of the big 
trees at the end of the square. They 
were trees from a colony world, 
with oily purple bark. The leaves 
lay heavy and sodden in the street 
on one side of the square where the 
wind had driven them and some 

66 



were in brown drifts against the 
buildings, a brown against the wet 
blackness of the sidewalk. The 
leaves fluttered down in the wind, 
already heavy with wet and they 
stuck where they fell. I remem- 
bered the way the leaves turned in 
the wind as though struggling 
against it, but slick with rain al- 
ready and falling quickly as they 
crossed the square. Only the sharp 
quick gusts of wind were enough to 
carry a few of the leaves against the 
building, where they would stick for 
a while and then slide down the 
rough stucco and into the brown 
drifts. It rained like that a lot in the 
late fall and I had watched the rain 
from the upper storey of the build- 
ing across the square, his bedroom 
window with the blinds pulled up 
all the way. The corners of the 
window were misted up from the 
heat in the room and the cold glass 
breathed a chill into the room. 

A long time. 

. regard the waters in their 
rising . 

I pressed the words out. “What 
is to be done?” 

“Ask you all now. One last 
thing. On Earth your Fleet now as- 
sembles the Patanen — they who 
laugh at Fate. Those who do not 
fall from the sickness. Like you.” 

“Cases recovered from the 
Plague?” I asked. 

“Yes.” 

“How do you know?” 

“Empire studies them. All have 
been sent from the other worlds. 
Assembled on Earth. We learned of 
it recently. We have followers 
there, near the Patanen.” 

“Lengen Masters?” 

“No.” He shifted uncomfortably, 

GALAXY 




strained by the gravity. “We hide.” 
“The guru tradition doesn’t exist 
elsewhere,” Gharma broke in. “It 
would appear strange if the Lengen 
arose.” 

“There are Quam everywhere, 
then,” I said. “On all the colony 
planets, even Earth.” 

“Search for remnants,” the Mas- 
ter said. 

I nodded. Fleet would certainly 
pool the recovery cases for study. 
“Will these Patanen . will Fleet 
leant enough to matter?” 

The Master shook his head re- 
gretfully. “Collapse speeds down 
upon them all. We cannot halt it.” 
“What would you have us do?” 
“I reveal myself to you so you 
may choose. Know that: I do not 
command.” 

“I know.” 

“My burden is to pluck these last 
seeds, the Patanen.” 

“You want to go to Earth?” 
Rhandra said wonderingly. Soft as 
night, her eyes. 

“A last duty.” He breathed heav- 
ily with an aged remorse. The bony 
chest heaved, rattled, the ribs open- 
ing and closing like blinds. Alien. 
“I kenned this in a vision, once I 
knew you — ” a flick of an eyelid 
at me — ” and saw you whole. To 
Earth — it is possible?” 

“I suppose,” I granted, not see- 
ing immediately how it could be 
done. “We’ll bring them back from 
Earth, to Veden?” 

“Here may not be safe,” the 
Master murmured. 

“I agree,” Gharma said. “Veden 
will be free soon. The Empire can- 
not hold it for long, or the space 
around it. But the Plague proceeds 
here as well.” 



“Would destroy harmony of 
Veden to inject diverse cultures. 
Better a new world.” 

"Where?” 

“We have an Earthlike site. I 
will lead you to it after Earth.” 
“Look . .” I wrestled with 
plans* in my head. “The best we 
can do is a Jump craft of Class IV 
or V. We couldn’t possibly carry a 
large number of people aboard.” 

“If they were ordinary pas- 
sengers, yes,” Gharma said. 
“But the Quam on Earthside will 
cool the bodies. Lowering their 
metabolic rate will allow us to 
transport them in storage units.” 

I thought. The technique was 
standard and had been developed in 
the era of ramscoop exploration, be- 
fore discovery of the Jump. It kept 
a crew alive through the decades of 
flight. Their true aging was only a 
fraction of the elapsed time. People 
could be stacked in a small space, 
fed a trickle of air and food through 
their veins. Stored that way, a ship 
could carry many people. 

“And what of Earth itself. ?” 
I said slowly. 

“The Empire has nearly shrunk 
down to a few systems,” Gharma 
said. “The Quam will withdraw, of 
course, but ...” 

I nodded. The Patanen were the 
most valuable people in the Empire 
now, a last crucial healthy sample 
of mankind. Perhaps we could in- 
deed make a new start with 
them . perhaps. “Master ...” 
An edge in me teetered near. 
“I ... I am unsure ...” 

“True nature only now beginning 
to emerge.” 

I glanced a question. 

He slapped his fists into a ball. 

67 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 




“Locked. Your nature. Sometimes 
try to get out. I help it.’’ 

“Words, words ... I don’t . .’’ 

“Remember.” Gesture to Rhan- 
dra, followed by a manic sign, a 
skittering dance of the seven fin- 
gers. 

“The banquet,” Rhandra sup- 
plied. “The Madi.” 

He nodded, smiling for the first 
time in the long hours we had 
passed together. “Nature ... es- 
caped.” 

“That was me?” I murmured to 
myself, not convinced, fearing 
something I knew I should not. To 
be a Fleet officer, I saw, meant you 
put away a piece of yourself, for 
good. 

“You spoke clearly then.” His 
great head bobbed. 

“Ah,” I said, and suddenly felt 
emptied. Gush, the bad air out. Ah 
it was and ah it did. 

Rhandra gave a quick warm 
laugh of silk and silver. 

I looked slowly at us ajl, four 
humans and a Quarn, the cloth vault- 
ing hanging softly above us, and 
seemed to see it all from a vast new 
perspective. I saw that we were one 
and the same. 

So did a journey end, and another 
begin. 



Part V 
1 

Haste manages all things badly. 
We planned, plotted, lied — and 
still, it all turned on the captain of 
the Farriken, which had just 
emerged from Jump space near Ve- 
den. He had to believe this:

and, buying the story at face value, 
let our skimmer approach for board- 
ing. 

Luckily, he did. For a while. 

The Orbital Parametric Log was a 
block of blue crystal a half meter on 
a side, with delicate black ferrite 
stains embedded along fracture in- 
terfaces and slippage lines, carrying 
a thousand kilometers of magnetic 
memory in 3D array. A computer 
could read the swirl of dots at a 
glance. They unfolded into 3D in- 
dexing of orbital data for every 
ramscoop in parking orbit. To a 
computer eye the ships coasted in 
that crystal block, flecks of informa- 
tion that hopped from memory site 
to memory site. The Log was far 
more precise than any survey the 
Farriken could make by herself in a 



GALAXY 




reasonable time. It was indispensi- 
ble: Farriken had to smell the sheep 
before it could hunt the wolves. 

Our skimmer locked onto their 
receiving bay with a clang. We 
were through before they knew 
what was happening. 

There was a vacuum interface be- 
tween the skimmer airlock and the 
Farriken’ s. We didn’t wait for it to 
fill. Three Fleet men were blown 
across the distance by our air pres- 
sure when we opened our lock. 
They tripped the emergency access 
on the Farriken and wriggled 
through. An alarm went off. Before 
anybody could move on the Farri- 
ken bridge, two men had found the 
local lifesystem ducts. They shoved 
in stungas canisters, popped them. 

The third man was Majumbdahr. 
He clubbed a lock officer and 
forced open the hatch to the ship’s 
central tube. The Farriken is a 
Class IV Jump ship, with a big 
axial tube. Majumbdahr jetted down 
it, risking his neck. If he’d slam- 
med into a parked shuttle craft, or 
any temporary storage sacs, even 
his suit wouldn’t have prevented a 
snapped neck. 

But the Farriken was a tidy craft, 
everything secured nicely. He zip- 
ped along the tube without accident 
until he saw the bright orange of the 
lifesystem module and braked to a 
stop. 

Majumbdahr keyed in an entry 
request. An attendant stuck his head 
out of the rear hatch. Majumbdahr 
kicked him back inside, pressed an 
injection nozzle to his throat, and 
was squirming into Lifesystem Core 
before the body stopped thrashing. 
(We found the man later, in the 
tube, snoring.) One, two, three 



canisters of the stunstuff, and lo — I 
was the captain of a starship. 

The Farriken captain had 
sounded General Alert by then. 
Two bridge officers came swim- 
ming out into the axial tube. I was 
coasting inward. Training jackets us 
all: the one forbidden act in the tube 
is discharging a weapon. The rub- 
bery walls, once pierced, quickly 
spurt reaction fluid into the tube, 
sealing off the life zones from the 
airlocks. So, though a flame gun 
dangled at my side, I didn’t think to 
reach for it. One of the two saw us, 
turned, pointed — 

I tumbled, switching head for 
feet. 

Boots crunched into his chest. He 
spun away, rebounded off the tube 
wall. 

The other officer shouted some- 
thing, jaws gaping wide. (Suited, I 
heard nothing.) I snagged a hold on 
a wall mount. The second man 
braced himself against the tube, legs 
scrambling for a hold. He pushed 
off. 

I shoved against the mount, com- 
ing on him from behind. 

A wrench in my belt found its 
way into my hand. 

I clubbed him lightly. The 
wrench struck him at the back of 
the head and the tension went out of 
him. 

I turned. Gharma had pounded 
the second man three times in the 
stomach, then socked him in the 
jaw. He, too, seemed to lose inter- 
est in the proceedings. 

Two minutes had elapsed. We 
found later that no Mayday had 
gone out over ship’s channel to 
Fleet Control. That accomplishment 
wasn’t due to us in the tube,

though, but rather to the stungas 
that a moment before had hissed 
into every chamber of the ship. 

My ship. 

* * * 

It was good to sit once more in 
the Captain’s couch, to see the long 
and dimpled cylinder of the bridge 
encased in its swanky hush. 

I let myself stretch and luxuriate 
for a moment, joints popping, mus- 
cles yawning to themselves, and 
yes, it did feel good. The Farriken 
was the best ship I’d seen, bigger 
than the Sasenbo. It had plush or- 
ganiform padding everywhere, the 
sort which sops up debijs and even 
human wastes (if tKe Captain per- 
mitted such use; after all, it went 
directly into the reaction mass). A 
fine ship to risk your life in. 

“Majumbdahr reporting, sir.” 

“Sit. And drop the ‘sir.’ Perhaps 
the Council would consider us Fleet 
officers still, but I don’t.” 

“I see your point,” he said, slip- 
ping into the form-fitting couch next 
to me. Automatically he glanced at 
the screens and checked that all sys- 
tems were normal; not even decades 
on the ground can take that out of 
an officer. 

“Seems odd, somehow,” I said. 
“A storm of action, and. then wait- 
ing.” 

“Waiting is difficult.” 

“It would be easier if I felt like a 
Captain. The Sabal was so much a 
part of the ships I commanded be- 
fore ...” 

“Yes.” 

So I had a ship, but I didn’t have 
a corps of faceless officers in Fleet 
Central giving orders. Independence 

70 



brought its own fresh breath. 

Majumbdahr checked a readout 
and turned to me. 

“I just verified that all extra- 
planetary communications gear on 
Veden is silenced. They can’t call 
Earth now.” 

“Ah? And how did you check 
that?” 

“You’ll remember — one of our 
men, a Lengen follower, sent me a 
signal — oh, I see what you mean.” 
“Small matter. I’m sure if you 
passed on him he can be trusted to 
disable the last transmitter. ’ ’ 

“Fleet seems to have no suspi- 
cions, yet.” 

“When will the Farriken crew 
reach Veden?” 

“Five days.” 

“You’re sure the comm gear is 
dead aboard?” 

“Yes. I double-checked before 
we cast them off.” 

“Good. Good. We’ll be through 
the Flinger in another day.” 

He studied me. “We don’t know 
how quickly a junior officer on 
Veden will react, however, if he 
suspects. That is a significant un- 
known.” 

“Who do you think it’ll be?” 
“The medical officer, Im- 
irinichin. He’s always had an itch to 
command. He might jump at it.” 

I shook my head. “He didn’t 
strike me that way. In any case, 
how would he know?” 

“Perhaps someone in the Farri- 
ken crew got off a radio burst in 
time. The board doesn’t record or- 
dinary local traffic, so we can’t be 
sure.” 

“You know Imirinichin better 
than I — do you think he’ll buy the 
story we sent on tightbeam?” 



GALAXY 




“It’s not so wild, as Fleet orders 
go these days.” 

I scratched my chin. “Um ...” 
“Something might have happened 
that demanded the Farriken’s leav- 
ing on the double. And it would 
have taken time for us to get clear 
of the background radiation from 
the reaction engines, in that ancient 
skimmer of ours.” 

I smiled wryly. “Even Fleet, fail- 
ing as it is, doesn’t snatch away a 
Director, plus staff officers.” 

Majumbdahr grinned, and I had a 
glimpse of what he must have been 
like when young. “Is Imirinichin an 
expert on cover stories?” “He’s got 
the sensor network.” 

“All life is a gamble, Ling.” 
“Um.” I looked around. Muffled 
monitoring beeps came from the 
hooded consoles up and down the 
bridge. A skeleton staff manned the 
stations, scarcely three dozen in all. 
Those, plus the Lengen priests and 
the Master, were all we had. “A 
gamble? I would prefer more 
chips.” 

★ * * 

There was little point in waiting 
out the time before we entered the 
Flinger in a state of tension. I or- 
dered short watches and then the 
bridge to Majumbdahr. I could 
sense the adrenalin ebbing in my 
crew, the excitement of the board- 
ing fading. Now was the time to 
run silent and swiftly . 

I made my way down — outward, 
really — from the bridge, through B 
deck to C. I passed a smashed 
hatchway; Gharma was looking at 
it, shaking his head. 

“Difficult to believe,” he mur- 
mured. 



I raised an eyebrow in query. 

“These . were Fleet officers. 
In here.” 

“The Plague cases?” 

He nodded. “We had to blow the 
hatch to get them out.” 

“A bit messy,” I said, judi- 
ciously studying the foul interior. 

“They barricaded the room with 
furniture. Sealed off the air ducts 
with wadded sheets.” Some of his 
crispness and disdain returned. 

“You threw them into the skim- 
mer with the rest of the crew?” 

Gharma looked at me, his eyes 
intent. “This is a first line vessel. It 
should carry the best crew avail- 
able.” 

I sighed. “So it did.” 

“But three of them fell with the 
sickness before the ship could reach 
Veden.” 

“Yes.” 

“Imagine commanding a ship 
with a crew like that.” 

I studied him. Evidently he knew 
little of Regeln or the flight back to 
Earth from there. He probably 
hadn’t seen my personnel file. 
Well, someone had: the Master had 
referred to it during my meditation 
with him yesterday. 

I nodded mutely and went on. 
Rhandra and I had chosen a cabin 
out on C deck, for privacy. It felt 
strange to walk through a ship so 
quiet and still, as though it were 
waiting for something. I keyed into 
our cabin and walked in. “No 
news,” I said. Rhandra was lying 
on our cushioned mat, jonofu style, 
hand over her eyes. She sat up at 
the sound of my voice, black hair 
tumbling in the weak centrifugal 
gravity. 

“That I’m glad to hear,” she 

71 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 




said, and kissed me. “There has 
been too much news of late.’’ 
“Tired?” 

“I shouldn’t be, I know. Lighter 
gravity and all that. But lam.” 

I sat, shucked my sandals. 
“Things have moved too quickly 
for us all.” 

“A year ago a trip to Kalic was a 
big event,” she said with a slight, 
puckering smile. “Now I’m on my 
way to Earth, and after that — Yes, 
it is a little quick.” 

“Earth is a stopover. A few 
days, then we leave.” 

“For where?” 

“The Quam region of the galaxy, 
the Master says. To begin a human 
colony on an hospitable world.” 
“Ling ...” and I saw the strain 
in her face. 

“We don’t like being con- 
spirators.” 

“Yes. No whole person should 
have to act that way.” 

“If we had known the Master 
longer these decisions would come 
freely. We would have a focus.” 

She nodded. I parted my robes 
and opened hers as well. Our bodies 
fit together naturally, softly, as 
though we had been married for de- 
cades. 

I buried my face in the rich 
crackling scent of her hair. We 
formed a warm, secure pocket in 
the austerity of the narrow crew 
quarters. I thought distantly of 
Angela. 

She drew away. “It’s dangerous, 
all of it?” 

“Danger is relative.” 

She hit me playfully. “No need 
to be pompous. I don’t want you to 
lie around like an old bear and 
make stuffy pronouncements. You’ll 

72 



begin to sound like the Lengen 
priests.” 

I faked a yawn and tugged her 
over on top of me. She chuckled 
softly in the folds of my neck. I re- 
leased her hips; she pushed away to 
say something. Her shove tilted her 
back. I raised my knees. She gave 
an awkward jerk that I helped 
along. My feet caught her just right 
and before she could reach out for a 
handhold I pushed here, pulled 
there — she spun in the air, a meter 
high. I kept her tumbling with my 
bare feet for another ten seconds, 
laughing at her startled cries of out- 
rage, and let her drop. She thumped 
onto our pad. “Rrroww!” 

“There’ll be more if you don’t 
allow me my proper share of dig- 
nity. Until you’ve spent a month in 
low-g you’ll be at my mercy.” 

“So sorry. I didn’t understand 
the gravity of the situation.” 

I cuffed her playfully, we wres- 
tled, she pinned my arms. “I hope 
you give Fleet more trouble than 
this,” she murmured, and then the 
mood between us shifted again and 
I found myself staring pensively 
into her eyes. “The . dreams 
. you’re thinking of them, 
aren’t you?” 

I nodded mutely. 

“Ling ... I was dozing here, 
and I had something like the ones 
you describe ...” 

“Terrible, aren’t they?” I said 
with thin humor. “For five days, 
now. And the headaches ...” I 
stopped. I didn’t mention that often 
Angela appeared in the dreams. 
Angela. Staring at me. 

“Yours . always with the 
Master in them?” 

“Usually, not always. Despite 

GALAXY 




what I thought — or thought I 
thought — something in me doesn’t 
like cooperating with the race that 
has done all this to humanity.” 

‘‘In time . she began, and 
then the reassuring currents lapped 
over me again, the chimes rang 
deep inside. Let us regard the wa- 
ters in their ways . 

After a while I murmured, casu- 
ally, “Some of the others don’t 
seem to be bothered, though.” 
“Gharma.” 

“Right.” 

“The Lengen priests are keeping 
to themselves. These last few days 
they’ve not spoken to me.” 

“Or me,” I said, stretching, 
yawning. 

“They seem more rigid than the 
priests at the ashram.” 

“You haven’t seen these Lengen 
before?” 

“A few I knew, but none well. 
One priest from my home district 
was a friend of my family and I 
came to know him in my time at 
the ashram. He wasn’t selected to 
come with us.” 

“Um. Maybe the ones here were 
picked for courage. Or calmness 
under stress. Or maybe the Master 
simply likes them better.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” she 
said, nuzzling her nose into my 
cheek. “I’ll take some time to come 
to fullness with this. That’s what 
the Master told me today.” 

“How was your audience?” 

She chuckled softly in the folds 
of my neck. “I was awkward. I 
couldn’t seem to concentrate.” 

“Um hum.” 

“I suppose I’m still reacting to 
his being a Quam. I had no idea 
until that night.” 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



“It bothers you still?” 

“A little. He is alien. Strange. 
The Master knows so much about 
my reactions and how I feel. Even 
before I know myself.” 

I nodded and slipped off into a 
light, drowsy rest. 

* * * 

The corridors were cool and si- 
lent as I walked to my audience 
with the Master. Most of the violet 
phosphors were up by now, so I 
wore my Veden contacts. The Far- 
riken had ordinary Sol phosphors 
when we took her. We had antici- 
pated that, of course — it was one 
more sign of how isolated Veden 
was, why that planet had been 
granted the Hindics; adapted natives 
had difficulty even traveling to the 
more common G-type star systems. 
Phosphors are a monolayer that 
converts electrical current directly 
into light. We had only to paint 
over the Sol phosphors with a 
Veden monolayer and the emitted 
light shifted into the F-star spec- 
trum. But we’d had little time to 
make up the stuff, and now ran 
short. Most of C deck and part of B 
were still using Sol light. Also, I 
noticed the Lengen priests, who’d 
been delegated the job, had slapped 
the stuff on in broad swabs, missing 
some of the Sol phosphor al- 
together. The result was a spectral 
distribution that looked like a 
cloudy day to a Veden and deep 
twilight to an Earthman. I could see 
complications looming up ahead. 
Most of the Lengen priests were 
Veden-adapted; they couldn’t func- 
tion well on Earth. But the Fleet 



73 




officers used contacts, like me, and 
they could go to the surface. The 
Master had contacts, too, I’d 
learned. Evidently his home world 
had a redder sun, but it didn’t mat- 
ter, since he wasn’t leaving the 
ship. 

I rounded a comer and stopped, 
muttering a mild curse. Ahead the 
corridor was almost completely 
daik. Only Sol phosphors glowed 
there. The damned priests had done 
a spotty job. I circled around the 
shadowy corridors, taking an indi- 
rect route. I made a mental notation 
to get this situation fixed. 

“Director!” 

I. turned. Ghaima approached. 
“A few words.” I nodded. “I am 
concerned about storage of the 
Patanen,” he went on. “We must 
deploy added pods from the axial 
tube.” 

I began to stroll toward the Mas- 
ter’s quarters. Ghaima walked 
stiffly beside me, aims held behind 
him and shoulders squared. He 
looked more like a soldier here than 
he ever had on Veden. 

“Very well. Be certain the stor- 
age units are put into the pods cor- 
rectly. The bodies must be arranged 
so their feet point outward from the 
axis.” 

“Space requirements probably 
will not allow that. I — ” 

“ Make them allow it.” 

“I’m afraid — ” - 

“Look, these are people we’ll be 
stacking in, not cordwood. How 
would you like to lie on your 
side — or upside down — for a body- 
time of a week? When cooled 
bodies lie in a static gravity field 
they undergo corpuscular damage 
and muscle deterioration, because a 



few layers of tissue are supporting 
the rest of the body.” 

“The effective gravity in the 
pods is low.” 

“We have no idea how long 
we’ll be in transit. Even low accel- 
erations can do damage, given 
time.” 

“I see.” 

We approached the Master’s 
quarters. “Well, here we are,” I 
said lamely. Something in Gharma’s 
stiff manner made conversation with 
him difficult. I kept feeling as if I 
had to think of something to say 
next. 

“This is your regular audience 
time?” he said. 

“No, I callfed down when I had 
time.” 

“I hope you appreciate the honor 
of being so close to the Master. 
Most must wait for their audience.” 

“You’ve had yours today?” 

“No. No, I am later. I saw the 
Master a short while and now I go 
to deliver a message from him to 
Majumbdahr.” 

“About what?” 

“Lengen priest matters. Selection 
of ship’s tasks.” 

“Why doesn’t the Master tell 
Majumbdahr himself?” 

“He has elected to relay instruc- 
tions through you and me. He tires 
easily, as you know. The Master is 
living under conditions that differ 
considerably from his home 
world.” 

“What do you know about his 
planet?’ ’ 

“Nothing more,” he said quick- 
ly- 

I tilted my head. “How long 
have you known the Master was a 
Quam?” 



74 



GALAXY 




He hesitated a moment, blinked. 
“A while longer than you. He went 
among the high castes first and was 
rejected by all but me. I am the 
only one from the very beginning.” 

“Well,” I said uncomfortably, 
“very good. I think I’ll go in 
now.” 

I passed through the antechamber 
where four Lengen priests sat in 
zazen pose. We exchanged ritual 
greetings. I brushed aside a beaded 
curtain that tinkled. In the inner 
vestibule the Master welcomed me. 

My meditation was as before, a 
deepening and yielding to inner na- 
ture. After, we talked. 

The approach to Earth occupied 
our thoughts. I was uneasy about 
our passage through the Ringer and 
whether any moves could be made 
against us from Veden, but the 
Master swept these aside. Earth was 
the focus, he said, and I should 
bend my thoughts to it. Our task 
was made easier by Reet’s caution: 
they’d assembled the Patanen for 
study in one location. There were 
thousands. 

I shook my head in amazement. 
“How can you get all this done 
under Reet’s nose?” 

“Same as Plague. Reach into 
centers of being.” 

“How?” 

“We studied. We have knowl- 
edge from your past. When you 
evolved. Accidents of form in each 
species. Scent centers. Pressure 
areas. Neural matrix. All define and 
constrain.” 

“I learned ...” I began, and 
then stopped, wondering why I’d 
read all that about left hemisphere 
and right, the limbic brain . 

“I ken. That was my doing.” 



“Why?” 

“So you see the path. I ken you 
are . seeker. Must know. Hu- 
mans have — tensions.” He made a 
steeple of his hands and pressed the 
bony fingers together, smiling with 
thin lips. “Early primates hunted in 
packs. Tribes. Sense of communi- 
ty” 

“Our natural state?” 

“Then, yes. Not now.” The 
steeple crumbled. “Mind whispers, 
says you are alone.” 

He peered deeply into me and the 
lights rippled, the waters lapped, 
and I saw it: Half-men cowering in 
caves at night, the sweaty scent of 
tribe around you, pressing close, 
safe and sure, a mate of your own 
and a place of your own, and 
yet . always, the voice in the 
back of the mind, speaking, think- 
ing, turning the world this way and 
that to catch the sunlight a different 
way. If you did this the prey did 
that, and you had to imagine these 
things, act by yourself in the hunt, 
the tribe together, running, calling, 
yet apart . 

You, and others. The balance lay 
somewhere in between. 

“A balance you destroyed,” I 
said, a sudden angry, flame within 
me. But the room sang, the waters 
rose, and I felt the peace descend. 

“Restored. You have natural 
fear — repressed terror — of crowd- 
ing. Is individual voice crying. 
Sabal submerges it. We — ” a snap 
of the fingers, clouds dispersing 
from his hands — “release. Fear 
comes out.” 

“You use direct sensory input?” _ 

He nodded. Bells chimed. 

“Fear of humanity . Why 
doesn’t it go away when 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



75 




your . treatment . stops?” 
‘‘Sabal resumes then. Amplifies 
fear again, so soon after.” 

“You have killed billions.” 

“We mourn.” His face froze into 
a mask. “ Arrogance . I help to cor- 
rect. Restore natural order. The way 
it was long ago. Then I walk.” 
“No!” But as I said it the anxi- 
ety eased away upon the waters. 

“It will be. I earn it now. To 
take the Patanen to the Firmament. 
To bring all things to rest.” 

“The Firmament?” 

“Outside the galaxy.” 

I saw it all suddenly. “The halo 
stars. The ancient ones.” 

“True. We fill them.” 

“You are that old?” 

His eyes gleamed in the shadows 
of his cowl. He made a wary sign 
of assent. 

We fill them. 

I tried to think of what it meant 
to span the great swarming sphere, 
a thousand billion stars, and peer 
down at the bright disc, knowing it 
was an astrophysical stepchild. Halo 
stars are on the average more iso- 
lated than disk stars and poorer in 
heavy elements. Civilization must 
have arisen more slowly there, had 
to claw its way up without rich 
lodes of metals. Their night skies 
would be dim. Red embers smol- 
dered there, not our gaudy O, B 
and A stars that burned bright and 
flared into early deaths. And in the 
distance the disk would bum, a 
gumbo of blues and yellows, dust 
lanes and misty nebulae, the hub an 
incandescent blob where the aged 
black hole spun and sucked, spun 
and sucked. What did it feel like, to 
live in the gutted halo worlds, your 
race ancient beyond counting, and 



watch the raw galactic beings 
spread like weeds upon fresh-turned 
earth . ? 

I shook my head. The vision left 
my head as quickly as it had come. 
“We ... I am to navigate above 
the galactic disk?” 

“In time. When the Patanen are 
in place.” 

“You had me study it, back then, 
didn’t you?” 

“Yes. You would need it.” 

“The expedition reports ...” I 
pondered, “I’ll have to recalibrate 
the Jump programming ...” 

I became lost in thought, and 
then lost in the rhythm of the cere- 
monies, and drifting, drifting with 
the tides and times, seeing all from 
a rocking swell in the great ocean, 
at peace.

Jagen clutched at us. It pulled me 
back into my acceleration couch, 
trying to drag me down the bridge 
into the tail of the Farriken. We 
were skimming closer to that ball of 
neutronium than I’d been in my 
pod, so long ago. The tidal stresses 
plucked at us. I knew the Farriken 
could take stronger strains than 
this . 

The mind reassures, but the body 
is ignorant. My muscles tensed to 
fight the pull, even though I knew I 
was safe. Ping and crack, the ship 
flexed. A stylus rolled on my con- 
sole and fetched up against a toggle 
switch. 

I eyed the screen. Lekki boiled 
below, streamers coiling like snakes 
along the magnetic field lines. Ion 
winds whipped in a violent, violet 



76 



GALAXY 




dance. I wiped my brow, though I 
was cool. 

“Something coming in from the 
satellites,” Majumbdahr broke the 
strained silence of the bridge. “It 
looks like a torch spectrum they’re 
picking up.” 

1 swiveled about to watch the 
screens face-on, bracing against the 
lug. “Course data holding firm?” 

“Yes sir. Point zero zero five 
r.” He thumbed to a new index. 
“Several sensor satellites have the 
signal now, sir.” 

“How far away?” I said. 

“Eight six point three million 
kilometers.” 

“Sure it’s a fusion flame?” 

“Yes.” 

Sometimes in the last few min- 
utes, while we were close to Lekki 
and our ship sensors blinded, the 
white torch of a reaction engine had 
flared on. It lay ahead of us. The 
satellite eyes had whispered warning 
now, but they had to be minutes 
late. 

“A ramscoop.” 

“I expect so,” Majumbdahr said. 

I pressed Emergency Stations . 
Wailing sounded down the bridge. 
Heads raised to look at me, then 
ducked back to their cacoon con- 
soles. 

“Imirinichin,” Majumbdahr said. 

Ghaima, sitting beyond in Engine 
and Fuel Systems Command, nod- 
ded grim assent. 

“It appears as though our es- 
teemed medical officer has plucked 
up the fallen standard,” I said. 
“Give me an intercept.” 

“Computing,” Majumbdahr mut- 
tered. 

“We’re going into rebound, sir,” 
Gharma said over intercom. I 



glanced screenward. Jagen grew 
into a sullen red ball bathed in a ra- 
dial spray of blue lines: images of 
the stars beyond, their light warped 
by the deep gravitational potential 
around the Black Dwarf. 

“Max stress,” Gharma called. I 
thumbed in a satellite view of us. A 
gleaming blue ball was arcing in a 
tight circle around a black nothing- 
ness. The Farriken ’ s organiform 
had filmed over with a metal-like 
polish hours ago, to reflect away all 
but a millionth of Lekki’ s light; a 
chrome starship. 

“That ramscoop is nearly dead 
on our course,” Majumbdahr said 
quickly. “Intercept in fourteen min- 
utes, twenty-one seconds.” 

The Farriken groaned. Our in- 
struments began to unfog. Plasma 
roiled, red and whispy, sucked free 
of Lekki by Jagen’ s grip. I felt 
pressure begin to ease. We were 
zipping outward now, our velocity 
matched to Earth- Sol. 

“Compute a dodge pattern.” 

“Done, sir. Wait . our mass 
detector is coming online again. I’ll 
try for some new data with it. The 
readings should be more accurate 
than these correlation measurements 
I’ve been using from the satellites.” 
Majumbdahr punched in commands. 

My intercom buzzed, but it was a 
low-priority call. I chopped it off. I 
noticed I was biting my lower lip. 

“How does it appear to you, 
sir?” Gharma asked. 

“Imirinichin is smarter than I 
guessed. He waited until we were 
so near Jagen our mass detectors 
went blind. Then he moved. He 
must have guessed we’re headed for 
Earth; that would tell him our exit- 
ing trajectory.” 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

I studied readouts, and then: 
“We can’t clear the blast, sir,” 
Majumbdahr reported. “It looks 
like Imirinichin has a big fat win- 
dow for detonation. The scoop itself 
can’t get close, but . he’ll blow 
the ramscoop fusion plant.” 

“And let the debris expand at 
relativistic speeds, snagging us.” 

“I can cut down the radiation 
with some maneuvering.” 

“Do so,” I said. “And check 
back with the mass detector. 
You’ve narrowed its range down to 
get a good reading on that scoop, 
haven’t you? Now scan for anything 
further out, too.” 

He and Ghaima began working 
feverishly. I listened to the whine of 
the air circulators, trying to think. 
The main screen showed us, a fat 
blue dot surging up from Jagen. 
Goodbye, Dwarf. 

I glanced down the bridge. In 
each console cluster many couches 
yawned empty. Here it was easy to 
remember we were pinned to the 
wall of a cylinder, the floor 
stretched away two hundred meters 
to right and left, but curved up and 
away into the ceiling, in front and 
behind me. Far to the left, a Lengen 
priest on standby duty made ritual 
hand passes, perhaps to calm him- 
self. 

“You’re right, sir,” 
Majumbdahr’s words were clipped. 
“Three more scoops are moving, 
further out from the first.” 

“It’s a blind,” I said. “Even if 
we dodge the first fusion blast, it’ll 
jam our sensors. Then the later 
scoops hit us before we can recov- 
er.” 

“We have attained max rebound 
velocity, sir, as computed,” 

78 



Gharma broke in. “Vector sigma 
net exceeding 0.0004.” 

“Give me a new course, Mr. 
Majumbdahr. Maximize the square 
of the distance we can get between 
us and all four of the plasma 
clouds, if those scoops detonate. In- 
clude the shock wave effects.” 

“Computing.” 

I glanced at visual display. 
Ahead, an orange cone burned: 
ramscoop exhaust. Our projected 
trajectory was a dashed line. The 
cone pointed toward a red-tagged 
dot along the line, the place where 
we would intersect the blast wave. 
As I watched we crawled visibly 
toward the dot. 

“Log new course,” I ordered. 
“Automatic firing sequence — nose 
about.” 

Immediately I felt the rumble and 
tug of our own motors. Gyros 
brought us around, pushing aside 
the fingers of Jagen’ s tidal grip. 
Somewhere a servo whined. 

“Get an estimate of probable 
radiation damage,” I called to 
Majumbdahr. He thumbed in orders 
and downbridge a technician re- 
sponded: numbers flashed on my 
screen . 

“High,” I said, between nar- 
rowed lips. “Too damned high. We 
can’t take that.” 

“I can’t give you anything better, 
sir,” Majumbdahr said. “He has us 
boxed in a narrow channel.” 

I nodded. “Prepare for Jump 
space.” 

There was silence. No one 
moved. 

“It is a risk we must take,” I 
said. 

“Yes sir,” Majumbdahr said 
with a note of glee. He slapped a 



GALAXY 




switch. A hooting wail sounded 
along the bridge. Lights dimmed to 
conserve power. 

“Metric Computing!’’ I called. 
“How large are the Riemann- 
Christoffel elements in the region 
just in front of the first scoop?” 

An underofficer somewhere an- 
swered me. “Within four percent of 
critical, Captain.” 

“And how many ships have been 
lost going into Jump under those 
conditions?” I murmured, thinking 
to myself. 

“Several. The probabilities are 
difficult to calculate in a highly 
warped field such as this, sir, 
and — ” 

“I know.” The Farriken had 
come out of Jump space well clear 
of the entire Lekki-Jagen planetary 
system, where the tensor elements 
were well known, and then coasted 
in to near Veden. Taking her into 
Jump on Jagen’s doorstep was — 

“Jump computation finished, 
sir,” Majumbdahr called. 

“To what order?” 

“Third order in local coordi- 
nates.” 

I grimaced. What good was a 
calculation good to five decimal 
places, when we couldn’t measure 
the input data to better than three 
places? 

“Power reserves, adequate,” 
Gharma said calmly. 

“Wait — I’m getting something 
more,” Majumbdahr said. “Mass 
detector is back on full scan and — 
oh, I see.” 

“See what?” 

“It’s that anomaly again, sir. 
High above the plane of the eclip- 
tic.” 

“That again? I thought it was a 
THE STARS IN SHROUD 



sensor malfunction.” 

“So did I. But it’s still there.” 

“It cannot be a ramscoop,” 
Gharma put in. “We never Orbited 
any that — ” 

“Of course not,” I said irritably. 
“It registers as a large mass. How 
far out is it?” 

“More than a billion klicks,” 
Majumbdahr said presently. 
“Perhaps further. That’s a lower 
bound.” 

“Oh, no trouble after all,” 
Gharma said. 

“The range of scan of this Class 
IV detection system is greater than 
I’m used to,” Majumbdahr said 
slowly. “Sorry.” 

“No matter,” I said. 

“Still, I wonder what it is,” 
Majumbdahr murmured. “Mass 
reads larger than any ship. Could be 
a large asteroid.” 

“How accurate is that mass 
data?” I asked. 

"I would have to do an autocor- 
relation analysis — ” 

“No time,” I said with sudden 
energy. “Majumbdahr, put an au- 
tomatic scan-and-file on that thing 
and forget it.” 

I peered at the screens. While the 
talk had gone on I had made my 
decision. 

“So it is. Bridge! Metric Com- 
puting.” 

“Sir.” 

“How does the failure probability 
increase if we go to maximum 
boost?” 

“Ah . rises by 1.84, sir.” 
“Interesting. Not that it matters, 
gentlemen.” I looked around me at 
tightened faces and kept my voice 
conspicuously calm. “We’re fresh 
out of alternatives.” 



The red ball clawed out to meet 
us. Plasma billowed in great banks, 
lit by hydrogen lines. In such a 
sleet of protons we would fry in 
twenty seconds. 

Far away hung Veden, a creamy 
dot. Star of India. 

“Time,” I called. 

A rush, a swirl of light. 

The falling — 

Metal groaned. Someone 
screamed. 

The world outside Farriken 
smeared. We shot by the fireball, 
through the Jump. With a Pythago- 
rean power, Number held sway 
above the Flux.

Through the starless, naked 
night — 

Our run to Earth took nine days. 
The blank bare silence outside made 
the Lengen priests uneasy; a dis- 
quiet seeped into the ship. I noticed 
it and began their training early. We 
needed teams to bring back the 
Patanen from Naga, where they 
were assembled. The exercises and 
weapons training raised everyone’s 
spirits, including mine. 

I spent days reprogramming the 
Farriken so we could make one 
long Jump to get free of the galactic 
plane. The Empire was vast, but its 
kiloparsec diameter was a fleck in 
the turning sea of the galaxy. Earth 
lay a third of the way out from the 
galactic hub, near a spiral arm. The 
galaxy was ten kiloparsecs thick in 
Sol’s neighborhood. Clearing that 
vast chasm in one Jump would bum 
two thirds of our fuel. There was no 
coming back from the halo stars. 



80 



GALAXY 




I designed override subsystems to 
stop the Farriken from dumping us 
out of Jump space too early, when 
its safety monitors panicked. 
Gharma and Majumbdahr labored 
on backup systems. 

Activity lifted my spirits. I had 
always detested intrigue; thus my 
failure at the low order palace poli- 
tics of Fleet. The week before we 
occupied the Farriken ran thick 
with deception and the stench of the 
half-lie. I became depressed almost 
without realizing the cause. But 
when Imirinichin showed his 
hand — I was sure he was cursing 
himself now for playing it a mo- 
ment too soon — I had felt an old 
exhilaration, one I thought long 
dead. It came from being involved 
again. 

I had come to think of myself 
over the last few years as a man of 
contemplation. As a young scholas- 
tic I had decided that men of 
action — the only kind worth admir- 
ing, I thought then — seldom heeded 
or needed men of contemplation. 
Oh, perhaps for an occasional prac- 
tical reason, yes, but not as a habit 
of mind. So, much later, when I 
sought solace from the world, what 
in boyhood was a conviction had 
become an unconscious axiom, and 
it placed me firmly in the role of an 
introvert among men who did 
things. 

These recent days brought my 
youth swimming back in a way dif- 
ferent from the rekindling Rhandra 
caused. I liked action and move- 
ment, the singing zest of conflict, 
but it had to be to some puipose: 
something better than patching up 
the Empire. I needed momentum, a 
vector, not the constricted sense of 



human possibility — of which Sabal 
was a subtle but integral part — of the 
Mongul. 

My work in Fleet had a touch of 
that energy, once. It ebbed away as 
I rose in the ranks. Finally I did not 
even know it was gone. 

There are many ways to shorten a 
man. Cynicism is the easiest. That, 
too, I affected for a while, in my 
middle years with Fleet. Then I had 
turned to Sabal for what refuge it 
could give. And now in a curious 
cycle I had returned to the consum- 
ing concentration of work. I spoke 
of it to Rhandra and she quoted a 
Veden song-thinker: Doing’s the 
one reward a man dare ask. 

While we worked. Earth drew 
nearer. We were running scared. I 
had captained mining shuttles, hop 
transports, suborbital cyclers, cargo 
barges — everything but prime Jump 
vessels. Running the Farriken with 
a skeleton crew meant I was on the 
bridge fourteen hours a day, 
minimum. I prepared routine- 
sounding reports and sent them 
under my signature as Veden Fleet 
commander. I also wrote humdrum 
Farriken reports and transmitted 
telemetry. I threw in some com- 
plaints from each Commander about 
the other, just to keep things plausi- 
ble. 

Plans win through or fail not be- 
cause of great ideas, but by small 
details. 

* * * 

Numbed by a fretwork of small 
items to remember and deal with, I 
lost my way on the route to the 
Master’s quarters. I blundered into 
the dreary twilight of a Sol phos- 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

phor corridor, tried to work my 
through it anyway, and failed. The 
Lengen priests were the only free 
hands we could spare to prepare 
extra Veden phosphor mix, and 
Majumbdahr reported them blithely 
uninterested in work. As a com- 
mander their bland unconcern irked 
me, but I said nothing of.it to the 
Master when I reached his quarters, 
late, and my audience began. 

I was only fractionally immersed 
in the lilting rituals- when the Master 
nodded abruptly and spread his 
hands, palms down and flexed, to 
signal the end. 

“State is not right,” he said 
rapidly. “Attempting focus while 
mind — ” He twirled a bony finger 
by his head. 

“I — I do not feel so — ” 

“Ah,” he said, nodding viror- 
ously. “Are. Look — position. Not 
resisting weight through body 
center.” 

I glanced down. As far as I could 
tell I was in proper sitting form, a 
slight variaion in the stylized 
Buddha pose. Alignment of spine 
felt correct. Odd; surely 1 wasn’t 
fooling myself that well. There had 
always been some telltale signs be- 
fore to show how I - was throwing 
off my own concentration. Today 
my mind was fuzzed a bit, yes, but 
I felt properly placid. 

“See now?” the Master said 
quickly, breaking the pause. 

“No . .” 

“Ah.” His eyes darted to the 
side. I noticed that he was uncon- 
sciously tapping the majatin mat 
with a webbed foot. “Can ken. Im- 
portant moment approaches. 
Perhaps — perhaps is bad time.” 

“Master,” I said, “I can leant as 



much in these moments as in any 
other. My inner place is undisturbed 
by the days to come, I feel that se- 
curely.” 

In truth I felt slighted by his as- 
sumption that I was getting nervous 
about the mission. Enlightenment 
opens to one the eternal moment 
and seals the future until its time 
has come. While I had not attained 
the Buddha state, the evidence of 
my own mind told me I was not 
now deflected from the right path. 
Or was this presumptuous? 

“No.” Once more a side glance. 
A slap on his knee. “You do not 
ken. I judge your mood not right 
for study. There are many things 
you must leam.” 

“Master — ” 

“Wrong time,” he said abruptly. 

With a start I realized it was not I 
who was distracted, but the Master. 
He carried no aura of serenity about 
him now; he appeared as simply 
another mortal, worried about some- 
thing. He had misjudged my own 
state, and not been sensitive enough 
to catch the error. 

I frowned and made ready to go. 
Rhythmic motions, the old encasing 
rituals. And even as I passed out- 
ward through the kandimaji shrine I 
began to question my own re- 
sponses, to wonder if I had seen 
correctly, or if this was simply 
another layer of confusion I had to 
pass through, a cloud of illusion my 
own resisting habits threw up to 
shield a part of me that I would, in 
truth, be better off without.

“Sir?” Majumbdahr caught me 
on the downramp from the bridge.

“Tomorrow,” I said. I rubbed a 
sandy eye. 

“A moment.” 

“Very well.” I waved him to 
walk and we went ‘down’ onto B 
deck. 

“You remember the anomalous 
mass we saw on the detectors back 
at Lekki-Jagen?” 

“Yes. What of it?” 

“I . I’ve taken the scan-and- 
store readout.” 

“Why?” 

“Something bothered me about 
it.” 

He said this straightforwardly, as 
though daring me to criticize him 
for wasting time. But I knew he had 
been working very hard, and a good 
Fleet officer cannot be as meek as a 
file clerk. “And?” 

“It’s velocity is high and rather 
remarkable.” 

“How so?” 

“It will pass quite close to 
Lekki.” 

“Couldn’t it be interstellar matter 
drifting in?” 

“Not likely. Velocity is far too 
high.” 

“So? It could still be an odd 
fragment.” 

“Suppose it’s something more? 
Our readings give a mass of about a 
tenth Sol mass. Suppose it’s a Col- 
ossus?” 

That stopped me. In the twenty- 
second century some factions had 
abandoned Earth for political 
reasons and cast off into deepspace. 
They didn’t have Jump ships or 
even ramscoops in those days. In- 
stead they built crude reaction en- 
gines into asteroids, socked most of 
their party into coldsleep, and set 
out. Most never reappeared. Those 



who did were often turned into 
weapons. 

“I' see. No Colossus has been 
seen for centuries.” 

“Another possibility is that it is a 
simple rogue rock, on freefall into 
Lekkispace, but ...” 

“Improbable, I agree.” 

“So, sir . .” 

“What?” 

“I would like computer time for 
a full recorrelation of the mass de- 
tector data. Our velocity fix on this 
thing is poor. I can improve it by a 
high-accuracy resifting of the data.” 

“Um.” I frowned. “We need 
read-and-register space badly in the 
ferrites. I — ” 

“This could be important for Ve- 
den.” 

I sighed. The Empire was nothing 
to me, but Veden . .“All right. 
Rig it to run after we’re in Earth 
orbit, though. While we’re on the 
surface, in fact. There’s no time 
now.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

¥ ¥ * 

I picked our exit Jump locus 
carefully. We filed the official Far- 
riken reports a few hours before 
Jump. I’d suggested days earlier 
that we return to Earth, and Fleet 
had rubberstamped the request. 
They directed me to remember 
when speaking to the Veden Com- 
mandant that he was inordinately 
sensitive about his defensible vol- 
ume, like all regional Directors, and 
therefore to stress the scarcity of 
Fleet ships. 

I confirmed their first com- 
manded Jump exit. It was far from 
where I wanted, but if we ignored 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



83 




them and emerged elsewhere there 
would be red- ruby hell to pay. 
Earth could pick up any Jump 
transit within half a parsec; the 
super-c radiation burst was like 
waving a flag. 

Just before we Jumped I sent a 
request for a new Jump locus, ex- 
plaining that we had too high a 
matching velocity and didn’t want 
to waste time cutting it down. A 
Jump time was already computed 
and anyway the Farriken could de- 
celerate enough if Fleet Central 
would simply shift our exit point 
further from Earth. They grumbled 
and gave us — as I’d guessed — some 
last-minute choice about the precise 
spot. That meant they wouldn’t 
have a precise fix. 

Rhandra stood beside me at the 
bridge as the Jump came. A flicker, 
the prickling tension — 

We popped into being half a mil- 
lion klicks from Earth, with Luna 
hanging directly between us. 

“Fleet’s squawking about our 
choice, Captain,” Gharma called, 
listening with one hand to the run- 
ning telemetry. 

“They don’t want to bother get- 
ting a fix on our M and delta- V 
through Luna Control,” I said. 

We glided around Luna at high 
relative velocity. There were un- 
avoidable lags in telemetry between 
Luna and Earth, I knew, that 
shaved a hairline of accuracy off 
our known location. 

“Incoming orders,” Majumbdahr 
called. The screens rippled. Fleet 
was evidently pulling most craft not 
immediately needed into a dense 
screen around Earth. We were 
stationed a bit in from Luna orbit as 
part of a shifting defense grid. 

84 



“Umm,” I said, “As far as I 
know, no Quam ship has violated 
Earthspace. These precautions seem 
rather heavy.” 

“Perhaps they’re frightened,” 
Rhandra volunteered. 

“The Empire may be weaker 
than I thought,” I said. 

Luna swept below, her ancient 
craters seeded with yellow gems. 
The atmosphere shimmered gray- 
green. I popped my contact filters 
Into my palm; yes, now it was a na- 
tural blue- white. Rhandra had to get 
along with a dimmer, achromatic 
image. I wondered again how easy 
it might be to find a suitable F star 
among the halo swarm. 

We left the bridge for a while, 
since it was time for my audience 
with the Master. He saw each of us 
daily. When I emerged this time, 
feeling rested and my mind drifting 
peacefully, Gharma was waiting at 
the kandimaji shrine that framed the 
Master’s portal. “He tires?” 
Gharma said. 

“The Master? A little.” 

Gharma fretted. “He should not 
keep to so difficult a schedule. This 
is a great and tragic mission. He is 
passing through what is, for the 
Quam, the last journey. He is filled 
with an anguish such as we cannot 
sense.” 

“How do you know?” I asked, 
not because I doubted him, but be- 
cause his solemn air I found wear- 
ing. 

“I have been with him the 
longest. I sense his essence.” 

“I see.” 

“I left my family to follow his 
path.” 

“And Majumbdahr?” 

“He, too.” 



GALAXY 




These men had given up much to 
follow the Master. “Such 
power . 

“Yes. The Quarn works are 
many.” 

“Yes, vast,” I conceded. 
“Though not perfect, you’ll grant.” 

“The Master senses doubts in 
you. Ling.” 

“He does?” I thought of my au- 
dience days before, and the Mas- 
ter’s odd, edgy quality. Perhaps I 
had been wrong, though. 

“Your center resists.” 

“Ah.” My eye was caught by 
Rhandra, approaching for her audi- 
ence. She gave us greetings. 

“I should think increased medita- 
tion would benefit both of you in 
these last hours,” Gharma said. 

“If there is time,” Rhandra be- 
gan. “Surely — ” 

“Proper equilibrium is essen- 
tial.” 

“My hours are not so easily ar- 
ranged,” I said. 

“I believe before you leave the 
ship you should ask for added time 
with the Master. His hand should 
guide you.” 

“Perhaps,” I said grudgingly. 

“Ling needs rest,” Rhandra said. 

“I speak for the Master him- 
self.” 

“Oh?” I murmured. 

“There are levels of knowledge 
among the Lengen,” Gharma said, 
“just as there are grades of 
priests.” 

“We are not priests,” Rhandra 
said. 

“In these hours of this final task, 
I should think — ” 

“The Master, himself is pinched 
by the forces around us,” I said. “I 
feel we should all give mutual aid.” 



“The Master tires, perhaps, but 
he is still the Master,” Gharma said 
stiffly. 

“Can’t you talk to him? Con- 
vince him to rest a bit, if you’re 
concerned?” 

“No, he must see us all each 
day.” 

“Why?” 

“It is the Way.” 

I shrugged. Argument accom- 
plished nothing in this odd mystical 
navy I’d joined; I returned to the 
bridge. 

* ¥ * 

When I tried to tjiink about the 
Master, as in the talk with Gharma, 
ideas kept slipping away from me. 
There were things the Master had 
done, vast damage to people and 
cultures, that vexed me . yet the 
rising of the waters washed all care 
from me, and I saw these cares as 
yet another false way to pin me to 
the past, or prevent my own realiza- 
tion. The past, after all, was dead. 
The future loomed. 

* ¥ * 

I had designed the fusion 
warheads myself. Gharma knew a 
little about fusion jacketing and he 
helped me seal them with barium 
and potassium casings, all layered 
in shells to make the brightest pos- 
sible ionization cloud around the 
fireball. 

The Earth Defense Screen was a 
piece of history, a spider web of 
microelectronics that, the press 
agentry gushed, could pick up a 
sneeze on Venus. A gossamer net, 
sensitive, delicate — and stupid. 

I had always thought fhe EDS 

85 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 




was badly designed. It began as a 
simple tracking system. As Fleet 
grew they patched in more sensitive 
satellites with greater ranging. With 
the Quam war they added many 
more sensors until they could nail a 
ship down to half a klick absolute. 
The grid even registered lifeboats 
running without comm gear. 

All this came from multiplying 
the number of units, but never 
changing their sensitivity. The sen- 
sors could weather a solar storm, 
given warning. Otherwise they 
peered naked into the void; that was 
their weakness. 

The torpedoes went out with hol- 
low thumps. I watched them sprint 
away. Clumsy weapons, never used 
successfully against Quam. Our 
eleven torpedoes twisted, fanned 
out — 

Ahead, aft, at all sides: the sky 
splintered. 

“Send the emergency distress 
signal,” I called down the bridge. 

“Done!” 

A boiling wave of electromagnet- 
ic energy obliterated the nearest 
sensors. Further out, high-energy 
ions and electron-positron clouds 
seared away microelectronics. Noth- 
ing between Luna and Central 
could pick up our silhouette through 
that. 

We boosted inward. We buttoned 
up tight, antennas tucked in like a 
frightened dog’s tail to escape the 
scorching barium clouds. I listened 
to Fleet’s Emergency Response 
trigger. Bells clanged, our screens 
flared with confused images. 
Earth’s magnetic dipole field 
smeared the cloud into a wedge as 
it expanded. Soon Eskimos, had 
there been any left, would have 



noticed a brightening of the aurora 
borealis as high energy electrons 
sleeted down. 

We flew blind, sniffing our way 
in with occasional radar-like pulses 
from our mass detectors. But the 
Farriken’s permanent log knew Earth- 
space the way my tongue knows 
my teeth; we kept to course, bead 
on a konchu wire. 

When Farriken burst free of the 
snarling plasma we hung over a 
herd of ramscoppes, glinting 
metal-gray. They were awaiting 
loading for the empire worlds, un- 
manned. They rode a standard park- 
ing orbit that had not deviated in 
centuries; I could’ve given the orbi- 
tal coordinates to two places from 
memory. The scoops were the sheep 
we wolves would hide among. They 
drifted, several hundred strong, 
webbed on repulsion lines to pre- 
vent slight perturbations from caus- 
ing collisions. Some were damaged, 
fire-pitted, probably useless. Others 
gaped wide in their guts, mouths 
being loaded by automatic shuttles. 
Every few days a scoop was nudged 
out by low impulse reaction motors 
and cast off on a long hydrogen- 
gobbling course. Sol system had no 
Flinger to make the first accelera- 
tion cheap, so Earth usually had an 
excess of scoops waiting for re- 
flight; more came to Rome than re- 
turned to the colonies. 

This ever-changing flock of metal 
and organiform was a nuisance to 
Fleet Ships Catalog, I knew, they 
hadn’t the resolution to pick out 
every scoop. This close in to 
Earth — a nose-rubbing three hun- 
dred klicks up — Fleet might 
overlook us. 

Might.

Making love with Rhandra was 
by now a lesson well learned, a re- 
lined process. We had each stamped 
i he other with a style fresh and 
adapted. I no longer felt (when I 
did this, say, or that ) a pale shadow 
of times spent with Angela. 

1 had unmemorized the past. 
We coiled together in these 
last moments, finding new geome- 
tries for our well-rehearsed arms and 
legs in the low gravity: Galactic 
Man at the old slap and tickle. 

I lay awake for a while staring 
into the blank darkness. Outside, 

I iarth waited. Outside was every- 
thing, and inside here was my 
mind. 

Consciousness was an analogue 
map, a point-by-point tracing of the 
world, and it was generated by 
words. The left side of the brain, 
painting reality over with a lacquer 
of language. Yet something inside 
resisted the steady rain of words. 
Our time sense, for one. Something 
stretched and compressed time ac- 
cording to the intensity of experi- 
ence, following the ticking of its 
own ancient clock. What part of us 
did that? The Quam knew, I was 
sure. Had there been a time when 
the right brain ruled? Did the Quam 
know us then? Did the Master him- 
self? The right brain spoke to us 
now with a thick tongue, muttering 
below the bright clarity of pressing 
sentences from the left, raising lids 
of boxes we could not pry up with 
language. Was there buried down in 
there the lind between animal shame 
and human guilt? The swelling hun- 
ters fear that became human anxi- 
ety? Perhaps the Quam knew all 



that. But the Master’s worrisome 
anxiety, during that one audience, 
pricked at me. Did he know us en- 
tirely? We were not the creatures of 
millennia ago. Now we could sum- 
mon up our past for revision, 
sweeten our afternoons with day- 
dreams, rehearse the future — my 
mind flooded with gaudy images of 
the Earthward blooding to come — 
and forge many futures, events 
branching like a fragile tree. The 
ability to aim and fire is not a ver- 
bal one; the old cleverness ruled 
there. So I would need left and 
right brain. And the Master knew 
better than I what this fresh- 
scrubbed Ling could do. 

After sleep, with Khandra still 
dozing, I rose and went down to the 
armory. I had on my field Fleet uni- 
form. It was clean-cut, dark, excel- 
lent for concealment. The team we 
were sending down carried all the 
usual Fleet personal weapons; I 
found them rather unimaginative. I 
had worked in the backwaters most 
of my career, and there are places 
where a flame gun is just so much 
gaudy hardware. I needed a few 
touches of subtlety. 

I‘d made up a few items on the 
voyage. A pencil-sized .tube went 
into my pocket. Throw it ten meters, 
away and a small powder charge 
disperses a paralyzing irritant, 
neatly taking out a five-meter vol- 
ume, but no more. Below my belt I 
tucked a silent air pistol. It fired 
shells stuffed with poisoned flechet- 
tes, fine needles that followed bal- 
listic paths once the shell exploded. 
Some shells I’d packed with white 
phosphorus, too, to shed a little 
light on problems. Inside my shirt I 
wedged a particular* nasty: a

plastic-jacketed pancake, green 
when wet. Slip it from its jacket 
and the wetting agent escapes in 
twenty seconds or so. Slide the wet 
cake under a rug or into some 
grass. Once dry, any impact will 
explode it. Tear off a piece and 
stick it like an old wad of gum to a 
door jamb; when the door closes, 
presto. I’d picked up that one on 
Laganat, from some terrorists we’d 
captured. They used it because it 
was cheap and easy; they preferred 
flame weapons if their could get 
them. 

To this I added the usual: a 
strangling-wire that reeled out of a 
wrist band, night specs, gas gren- 
ades. All the comforts of the mod- 
em world. 

* * * 

We used drift-craft for the des- 
cent. Farriken carried pods of them. 
They were gossamer ships, metal- 
free to avoid EM detection, with 
fall-away jets for suborbital work 
and then sails, chutes, ailerons, 
stabilizers, swoop- rudders and the 
rest for skating through the atmo- 
sphere. Most were four-man jobs. 
There were a few one-man gliders, 
though, and I snagged one. They 
were programmed, so all but the 
last fifty klicks down were or- 
dained. I reviewed the troops as 
launch time approached, said a few 
words of encouragement, slapped a 
few shoulders. They were nearly all 
Fleet men, most with their Sol- 
adapted vision intact, and a few 
Lengen priests who’d never been 
off Veden. They’d be nearly use- 
less, except in dealing with the 
Quam on the surface. 



We dealt with a thousand last de- 
tails. We sang our final gonjii 
chant. We climbed into the stiff- 
winged gliders. We coasted out to 
the lock. Farriken’ s launch rachet 
seized us each in turn. I relaxed ut- 
terly, saving energy. 

The hatchway slid open before 
my bubble. Stars burned. 

God kicked me in the tail. 

I shot out, across a harvest field 
of ramscoops, and plunged down 
toward our grazing impact with 
Earth’s film of air. 

It was a dreamy time. 

A thump as the low-luminosity 
bum came on (invisible from be- 
low, we hoped). A hissing as winds 
plucked at me. Below, blue — a 
stark titanium blue that would swal- 
low all other colors. Earth spread 
out below me with its tangle of 
small lives and deaths that from a 
distance appears a lawn but up close 
is wrenchingly confused and cruel, 
a mad jungle. 

Drifting. Chutes popping dutifully 
open. Sails slanting me down. 
South America, yawning in sum- 
mer’s heat. 

Then we were drifting over New 
Guinea. Tumbled ridges of green- 
brown jungle, sliced by muddy gray 
rivers. Men lived there now, but 
still not many. I had ventured there 
once, been bitten and pricked to dis- 
traction, and sworn I’d never go 
back. Now it was absolutely certain 
I would keep the promise. 

To the east lay the Solomons, 
now an ofkaipan slum. My slightly 
pinked skin would not raise an 
eyebrow there. Lumps of brown 
strewn to the horizon by a careless 
Creator, now bathed in Pacific sun- 
light that swathed it in ruddy splen-

dor, a light like the cyrstallized air 
of the centuries. I had holidayed on 
one of those specks, sleeping on a 
pallet with relatives who sweated in 
the fields each day, eaten a fierce 
vegetable curry, washed it down 
with a dark, solemn stout. A soft 
and quiet time, before Fleet and 
Angela. 

Leaves falling on a still day: slip- 
ping down the winds, a covey of 
stupid birds too lazy to flap. liyte 
and Samar we skirted around as 
dawn broke on their urban sprawls. 
Panay sulked on the horizon. We 
slipped lower. Quezon gleamed 
with street lights. 

North now: Cataduanes. Luzon. 
Mountain ridges clutched up at us. 
We dipped, skimmed. Then Naga. 

No sign of detection. No scree of 
intercept jets . 

Outside Naga we found a soccer 
field. It lay in dark, though moun- 
tain peaks nearby glowed with 
dawning. I banked and surveyed the 
surrounding land. Nothing stirred. 

I ordered them down. My little 
convoy peeled off one by one and 
swooped in for a bouncy landing. 
Waiting, I studied Naga’s shadowed 
profile. No movement, not even air 
cars. 

A long column of smoke traced a 
finger from far beyond the city, 
smudging the air nearby. Above, 
the stars swam in shroud. 

My flock was down. I swooped, 
glided, wind sang in the struts. 
Thump and I was back in Rome. 

♦ * * 

Military history is the story of the 
terrible murder of beautiful plans by 
ugly facts. 



I’d selected a second-rate farm 
road for our appraoch to Naga. I’d 
hauled vegetables over it a hundred 
times as a boy, working for summer 
wages in the fields. A sleepy road, 
nothing more. 

There was no reason whatever to 
put a Fleet recreationaL facility 
seven klicks from Naga along that 
road. None. 

But there it was, complete with 
three gate guards. I got out of the 
car we’d stolen and tried to talk 
them around. Seems the soccer field 
was in a Fleet enclosure, and they 
were curious about how a team of 
officers and men had spent the night 
in a days-only facility. 

One of them wanted to call in 
about it. Once he got this idea he 
refused to let go of it. Maybe he 
just didn’t like taking an ofkaipan’s 
word. And he never took his hand 
off his sidearm. 

His arm moved — 

So I shot him. 

Then the others. 

The air pistol coughed three times. 
The flechettes bored deep. It was 
messy. 

We cleaned up quickly. 

We swiped some Fleet cars. 

Naga was stirring as the east 
cracked open with dawn. Trash 
drifted in the gutters everywhere. 
Shop windows were often boarded 
up. Pedestrians eyed us, then 
moved on, scurrying. 

I felt exposed as hell. Every tenth 
block in Naga had a Fleet box on 
the comer. A sentry lounged in it, 
squinting at us as we rumbled by, 
an arm casually draped over a BFX 
auto weapon on a tripod. Occasion- 
ally its snub snout followed us in a 
lazy arc. 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

We went by Fleet offices, a 
rotunda and marble colonnades 
basking in the rising sun. They 
needed a washing; streaks of black 
and brown wrote an old story on 
their faces. 

Away from Naga center there 
were no more signs of Fleet. Offi- 
cial buildings gave way to long, 
gracefully arched residences, prickly 
with brick pilasters, . fragile col- 
lonada, ostraku arcades. But here, 
too, few people walked the streets 
gold- rimmed by day. 

Here the plan went well: I found 
the warehouses easily, in fact re- 
membered them from times I had 
worked nearby as a boy. There 
were no Fleet police in this district. 
They seemed drawn up around Fleet 
buildings, letting the civilians fend 
for themselves. 

Someone spotted us and, clunk , a 
warehouse door slid aside. An arm 
beckoned. Our party of eighteen 
covered the vacant street, then slip- 
ped inside one at a time. I went in 
first. 

“Sanjen?” He was a short, 
stocky Fleet Lieutenant, plainly 
edgy and worried. “I’m Cantalus.’’ 

We shook hands. Cantalus was 
orderly, efficient. He had the Pana- 
ten already in coldsleep vaults. His 
working crew was mostly civilians. 
I counted vaults. “We can squeeze 
this many in,” I said. 

“But it’ll be close.” 

“This isn’t all.” 

“Why not?” 

“You must understand ... I 
have been taking a few dozen Pana- 
ten at a time from the Fleet quar- 
ters. We infiltrated the staff there. 
There were hundreds left.” 

“We’re not finished, then.” 

90 



“Sir, I — we’ve been discov- 
ered.” 

“What? How?” 

“Or I think we have. Last night a 
high officer came to the Panaten 
quarters. He wanted three of them, 
so We did not have to open the 
wards. Still, I think he was suspi- 
cious. He took the three away, but I 
think believe he may be back.” 
“Why?” “Why do you think 
so?” 

“The three Panaten were ... re- 
lated to you.” 

“What?” 

“Your wife. And two children.” 
“Impossible.” 

“No. I verified it myself.” 

My mind spun in a high and air- 
less place. I had thought little of 
Angela, had given up Chaik and 
Romana as lost. My opposition to 
their lobe-tapping must have given 
them some added advantage. But to 
have recovered — 

“Sir,” Majumbdahr said at my 
elbow, “they’ve got the trucks. We 
can start moving.” 

“Yes . Start.” I looked at 
Cantalus. I knew the next answer. 
“Who took them away?” 

“General Tonji.” 

♦ * •* 



I had arranged a pretext through 
Aii* Control, to allow us access to 
the automatic surface-to-orbit shut- 
tles. It was no great trick: we strip- 
ped encoding ferrites from the 
ramscoops parked near Farriken, 
and used those to order automatic 
shuttles, using ordinary comm lines 
in the ramscoops. 

The problem was getting the vaults 

GALAXY 




lo the shuttles. Cantalus had 
trucks. Could we get them through 
the streets? “That’s what we’ll have 
to do,” Cantalus said. He looked 
appealingly at two figures seated in 
the shadows that cloaked the huge 
warehouse. They were heavily 
robed and sat very tall and erect. 
Quam. But they did not speak and 
their hooded eyes stared out at us 
impassively. Cantalus turned back 
to me. “We have no other way.” 

“No access to copters?” 

“Not now. There is great de- 
mand. I could not — ” 

“All right, the trucks. You have 
permits?” 

“A few.” He produced some fer- 
rite stickers. 

“Enough to get all these 
through?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Let’s pack them in. Then we’ll 

see.” 

* ¥ * 

The morning heat rose thick and 
cloying from the street outside. I 
stood watch at the entrance bay of 
the storage warehouse. There was 
surprisingly little activity in the 
business district. As a boy I’d been 
jostled and awed in these streets, 
had flowed in the rivers of men and 
women and goods, swam in air 
freighted with price calls and bitter 
bargains, grunts of labor and cackles 
of glee. All gone, now. 

“We’re ready for the first de- 
tachment to shove off, Captain,” 
Cantalus reported. 

I eyed the narrow docking lanes. 
The hover trucks purred beside the 
loading cranes, riding low beneath 
the vaults. In the murky distance 



Mayon spit orange into the tropical 
blue, ringed in gray haze. 

“Go.” 

The Lengen priests conferred 
with the Quam, who still sat stiff 
and somber. Around them the men 
who were their followers sweated in 
the damp air. The Quam looked 
exhausted. They had accomplished 
much in so short a time. 

A priest approached me. “A 
moment?” I nodded. 

“The Masters wish to be ... to 
go in the vaults.” 

“Why?” 

“They wish to awaken amid their 
home worlds. They have no heart 
for the voyage.” 

“Well ... all right.” 

I listened to Fleet comm traffic 
over Cantalus’s unit It was spotty 
and oddly incoherent. Our fusion 
explosions had raked great holes in 
EDS. 

Then came a coded blip from our 
first detachment. They had gotten 
through and loaded an automatic 
shuttle. They were riding up with it. 

I sent Gharma with the second 
group. I helped load vaults myself 
to work off the tension that hung in 
the air like smoke. We wrapped the 
Quam. Their suety skin gleamed in 
the noonday light. I marveled at 
their bone structure: humanoid, un- 
like the other aliens we had encoun- 
tered, yet different in pelvis, joints, 
spine. They lay silent, their eyes 
filmed. The coolant fluids bubbled 
up to cover them. 

I clicked off the comm. “Gharma 
is lifting,” I said. 

“We are nearly ready to leave 
ourselves,” Cantalus said eagerly. 

“Mr. Cantalus.” 

“Yes?” 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

“Where did Tonji take the 
others?” 

“The base at Mindoro.” 

“How do you know?” 

“He said so.” 

“Why do you suppose he did 
that?” 

“What?” Cantalus waved to the 
men to finish the loading. 

“Why leave word of his destina- 
tion? Unless he wanted to be fol- 
lowed.” 

Cantalus looked at me. 

* ♦ * 

“Here’s the entrance,” 
Majumbdahr called back to us. We 
crouched in the rear of the hover 
truck. Dusty lanes zipped by as we 
sped down the last highway. 
Mahataqua trees nodded in the 
midaftemoon heat. Behind us in 
Naga a black finger curled up into a 
clotted cloud: a fire. A Slot? Even- 
tually there would be no one 
healthy enough to tend the victims. 
Then a fire would rage beyond con- 
trol. 

A massive organiform cube 
reared beside the road. I wrinkled my 
nose. The stench reminded me of 
the Slots. Around the cube nothing 
moved. 

We hummed, slowed, stopped. 
The whine died and we lowered to 
earth. I swung down from my 
perch. 

“Where’s your passes?” a guard 
was asking Majumbdahr. I joined 
them. Majumbdahr handed him a 
clip of ferrites and yawned. He 
leaned against the truck. 

The guard inserted the ferrites in 
his casette. It beeped. “Looks 
okay.” He turned to me. “We had 
a call through from Central, sir. 



Can’t firm up this departure time 
until we recheck. Some kind of 
hold on movements, don’t know 
why.” 

“More chickenshit. ” Majumb- 
dahr growled. 

“Yeah.” The guard eyed 
Majumbdahr, squinting at his Hin- 
dic features. Jle waved us through. 

“Double time it!” I called to the 
men below. I swung the autocrane 
around for another flat of vaults. I 
was loading them into the gaping 
shuttle bay in triple lots, exceeding 
the max on weight. 

Majumbdahr climbed up into the 
cage beside me. Sweat glistened on 
his face; a bead of moisture dropped 
from his chin and spattered on my 
flashing console. “How long do 
you think we’ve got?” 

“An hour at the outside.” 

“Right.” He nodded, weary. 
“We can load by them. But how 
about takeoff?” 

“When’ re we programmed?” 

“I just phoned it in. One hour, 
forty-two minutes. But there’s a 
hold on it.” 

“What’s the tower say?” The 
crane screamed, bucked. “Take one 
off!” I shouted down at the forks 
lifts. “Too much.” They moved in, 
the insect arms grappling. 

“They’re not letting anybody out 
until that hold is lifted.” 

“Shit.” 

“Maybe they found those 
guards.” 

I grimaced. I felt a twinge of 
guilt about it, even in the midst of 
this. Those three men were going to 
be with me a long time. Heat 
shimmered the air. I tried to think. 

“No, I don’t think so. Anybody 
could’ve done that.”

“Then what?” 

“General Tonji. He knows it was 
the Farriken that touched off that 
fusion blind. Fleet may accept the 
most logical explanation — that we 
blew our core and are now just 
dust. But Tonji ...” 

I squinted at the sun. A light 
winked on. I swung the crane 
around, cables ringing, and set the 
load down inside the shuttle’s 
hatchbay. 

“No, it’s too much of a coinci- 
dence for him to shrug it off. That’s 
why he took Angela, my wife.” 
“Sir?” 

“For bait.” 



* ¥ * 

The shuttle’s bay doors clanged 
shut. Cantalus and I dogged and 
sealed them. Sweat darkened our 
suits. 

“This craft won’t move a cen- 
timeter without tower approval. 
They’ve frozen the magnetic ser- 
vos.” Cantalus gazed at me stead- 
ily, plainly asking for an answer. I 
was in charge, wasn’t I? 

“Quite so.” I studied the bare, 
vast field. The tower was a block- 
house with a tall spire, a full klick 
away. 

The men stood around the load- 
ing bay. I waved the Lengen priests 
aboard. There were cramped but 
adequate personnel racks inside, 
enough for us all. 

I climbed up onto a catwalk, 
boots clanging on the metal, and 
made a megaphone of my hands. 
“We’re going to take the tower. I 
want three volunteers.” 

Majumbdahr raised his hand. 



Five others followed. I picked 
Majumbdahr and two others. “The 
rest — inside.” They filed toward the 
shuttle, most of them dragging their 
feet with fatigue. 

Cantalus approached. “We had 
not planned to leave with you.” 

“I think you should.” 

He looked uncomfortable. “As I 
said, we had not so planned. How- 
ever ... I called through on comm 
band to my duty station. The wards 
where we kept the Panaten are sur- 
rounded.” 

I frowned. “By whom?” 

“Fleet infantry.” 

“More of Tonji’s work.” 
“Perhaps.” 

“Board the shuttle then. No point 
in your staying here.” 

“Will there be room for us all?” 
“Just barely. When Majumbdahr 
gets back from the tower button up 
and lift immediately.” 

Majumbdahr was at my elbow. 
“Why me? What about you, Cap- 
tain?” 

I pulled out my air pistol and 
rearmed it. The magazine made a 
loud clack in the bay. “I’m not 
going with you.” 

“You must,” Majumbdahr said. 
“This is a personal matter.” 

The men stood around me, silent. 
I obliviously went on checking my 
weapons. “Sir . .” 

“No discussion, Mr. 
Majumbdahr,” I said sharply. 

“I will go with you. 

“No you won’t.” 

“You know the Jump programm- 
ing. You’ve altered our inflight sub- 
systems.” 

I could feel my face tighten. “So 
what?” 

“ Farriken can Jump without you, 

93 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 




certainly. But it will be more 
dangerous.” 

“Not much.” 

“But some. If I go with you the 
chances of your returning are bet- 
ter.” 

I sighed. “I don’t ask for your 
help.” 

“I didn’t say you did. I am offer- 
ing it. And you cannot very well 
stop me.” 

I waited. Majumbdahr gazed at 
me, impassive. Then he smiled very 
slightly. 

I began to wonder who w.as the 
hero here, and who the fool. 

“All right,” I said. “All right.” 

♦ ¥ * 

We got most of the way without 
trouble. The admin offices were 
nearly deserted. Ho hum. Business 
as usual. Few heads lifted to study 
us as we went by. 

We skipped the elevators and 
went for the emergency stairs. At 
the base of the spire I unshouldered 
my equipment bag and fished 
around for a lock decipherer. Farri- 
ken carried a few for emergency 
purposes and Gharma had thought 
to bring one along. I fumbled 
through my encoder sigs, stets and 
assorted gadgetry a Captain acquires 
by rights, and found it. 

The emergency stairway popped 
open without activating its alarm. I 
resealed it from the inside. We went 
up the stairs single file, pausing at 
each floor. 

Through a side portal I could 
peer down at our ground car. No- 
body went near it. 

At the top floor I sigged the dou- 
ble lock, then popped the alarm be- 

94 



fore it could blow. We waited for 
signs of interest from the other side 
of the fire door. Nothing. 

“Fast and easy,” I whispered. 

One of the men kicked the door 
open. 

We charged through. 

I pitched a gas grenade. It went 
off in Forward Control. Brown 
smoke poured out. Two Fleet 
officers turned toward us. They 
opened their mouths but no sound 
came out. One pointed. Then they 
both fell. 

A Lieutenant rose up from his 
console and scrabbled at his side. 
The man next to me launched him- 
self forward. 

He hit the Lieutenant just as a 
pistol appeared in the space between 
them. They crashed into a readout 
casement. The pistol didn’t go off. 
Majumbdahr was there by then. He 
clubbed the Lieutenant with a flame 
pistol. 

The gas hissed away, dissolving 
into harmlessness. I swung my air 
pistol around to cover the rest of the 
Control pits. 

They were empty. The tower was 
run on a skeleton crew. 

* * * 

We held the tower top for over 
fifteen minutes. 

I dropped grenades through a 
rollout window, directly on the first 
squad that came to check out a call 
from below. By that time 
Majumbdahr and I had figured out 
enough of the launch procedure to 
lift the hold on our shuttle. 
Majumbdahr programmed and 
called through on comm to clear our 
passage. I covered the stairs. The 

GALAXY 




other two bracketed the elevators. 

That’s where two underofficers 
appeared. The elevator zipped open 
and there they were. 

One step, two — Flame guns 
brought them both down. 

Majumbdahr called out that we 
were cleared. I swung around from 
covering the stairs. Only then did I 
notice that one of our men was 
lying with his side blown away. 
One of the elevator men had got off 
one shot; I hadn’t even heard it. 

1 peered down from the tower. A 
chunk of concrete blistered and 
crumbled above my head. They 
were firing from below. Three men, 
as near as I could see. 

“We’re trapped,” Majumbdahr 
said. 

“Unless we can draw them in- 
side.” I leaned toward the open 
window and dropped another two 
grenades. The firing from below 
stopped. 

“Down the stairs,” I said. 

We clumped down as fast as we 
could. The man ahead of me 
stopped at the ground floor, where 
we had come in. I motioned him 
on. 

We ran down the last flight to the 
basement. It was dimly lit. We 
wandered down two corridors be- 
fore finding the surface exit. 

I could hear muffled firing: flame 
weapons. Time ticked on. 

“You think they haven’t got this 
covered?” the man with us asked 
me. 

“These are ordinary Fleetfield 
police. No guarantees, but maybe 
they’re thinking of saving the 
equipment upstairs more than get- 
ting us.” 

“I hope you’re right,” 
96 



Majumbdahr murmured. 

I wasn’t. 

Two steps out the doorway the 
man crumpled. Blood sprayed from 
his chest. I was right behind him. A 
flame bolt seared the air by my ear. 

I dropped behind an abutment. 
They had left one gunner by our 
car. I could see him crouching be- 
hind it. 

Two crisp frying sounds passed 
over my head from Majumbdahr. 
Both missed. I aimed my pistol at 
the man’s feet, which were still vis- 
ible. One, two, three shots — all 
kicked up concrete near him. 

“Don’t use a grenade,” 
Majumbdahr called. “We need the 
car.” 

I nodded. Aimed. 

One cough, two — a foot jerked to 
the side . The man fell into view . I 
fired three more times. He went 
still . 

“Come on!” Up and running 
with a blind, furious energy. 

I reached the car. Its side window 
evaporated. 

I jerked open the door and 
Majumbdahr lunged through it. I 
slumped halfway into the car and 
thumbed on the pilot. 

Whoosh — we shot up fifty me- 
ters. 

I slipped out of the seat. I 
clutched at the side rail. The car 
tilted, ready to boost to cruising 
speed. I screamed something. A 
hand appeared. I snatched at it. 

Air ripped beside me. A hot 
tongue licked at my leg. I wrenched 
myself up and got a thigh over the 
seat railing. 

A giant slapped the car. 

I lost one hand hold. Into the 
cradle, endlessly rocking — 

GALAXY 




Majumbdahr grabbed the other hand 
and tugged at me. I felt something 
tear in my biceps. 

The car was still accelerating. I 
looked down. The gray field flashed 
by below, blurred. 

All reality, I remembered, was a 
mere illusion. Really. 

Majumbdahr tugged on my hand. 
I got a purchase on the seat 
amounts and heaved upward. Wrig- 
gled partway into the seat. 

Wind buffeted me, howled. I rol- 
led in. The car door hissed shut. 

“You all right?” 

“Call the shuttle. Tell them to 
launch.” 

Majumbdahr fumbled at the 
comm and barked a few words. 

Squawksquawk. 

He nodded. “They’re off. No- 
thing will stop them now. Hey, you 
all right?” 

“Just glad I didn’t have time to 
think about that.” I panted. 

“You’re all right?” 

“I’m all right.”

Just breathing, for a while. 

It was absolutely fine to simply 
suck in the air. Feel it fill up the 
lungs. Then push it out. Sweet 
wind. 

Breathing had been something 
else back then — an hour ago? thirty 
minutes? An ordinary thing. 

After a while I began to notice 
jungle rippling by below us. Green 
sea. Spatterings of blue, yellow, 
colors clear and bright. Slowly the 
trembling in me started to ease off. 

I summoned up an old joke: It’s 
not that I’m too young to die, it’s 
that I’m too me to die. 



I grimaced. Some jokes don’t get 
old. Maybe that’s because they 
aren’t jokes. 

I started to think and then, shak- 
ily, to plan, and here’s how it went: 

Land at a civilian lot. Shortcircuit 
the lock on a cheap skimmer. Send 
the Fleet craft off like a bat out of 
the proverbial, north. Lift the 
skimmer, heading west. 

Ditch the skimmer at Batangas. 
Swipe a cruiser. Hop it to Lucban 
and leave it parked near the main 
street. Take a bus for two klicks. 
Get off. Buy five matanaglos from 
a street vendor. Speak to each other 
casually, walk easy, two officers 
taking a lazy day off. Stroll into the 
Toshogu Shrine and out the other 
side, to the House of the Ascending 
Dragons. Find a cloistered garden 
and eat the matanaglos. Drink from 
a nearby fountain. Catch a belt to 
the commercial district. 

There we had to move more care- 
fully. I made a business 3D call to 
the orbital trade center in 
Yomeimon. Then I had them route 
me through their net to offplanet 
comm. Then into Earthspace 
Licensing. By that time I was 
patched through enough channels to 
cover the origin of the call. I 
punched through the encoding I’d 
set up before leaving Farriken. 

Gharma answered. Then our back- 
up scrambler cut in. I had to re- 
code. The screen cleared. I told 
him — not in so many words — to 
look for a Fleet booster coming up 
on the ramscoop fleet, maybe to- 
ward morning. That would be us. 
Anything else was trouble. If there 
was any doubt, Jump immediately. 
Never mind the backwash — 
ramscoops be damned. Oh yes, and 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

incidentally — forget us, too. 

“The Master orders you back 
now,” Gharma broke in. 

“Why?” 

“This is unnecessary.” 

“I can’t leave without them.” 

“You must.” 

“Uh huh. Watch for me by 
morning’s light, friend.” And 
signed off.

Dark behind, daik ahead. A drop 
traced itself down my brow, hung 
on my nose. I puffed and blew it 
off. Insects pricked at my neck. 
Every moment or two something 
rustled nearby. 

Let them go. Some of those beasties 
were big enough to set off trip 
sigs, which meant Mindoro Base 
couldn’t use sigs this far out. Area 
Denial Theory, Course 21 3B. 

Clouds boiled in from the South 
China Sea, blotting the stars. The 
lights of Mindoro danced in the 
warm air. A bird warbled to itself. 
My night specs slipped on silently. 
I kept my eyes fixed ahead and 
turned my head slowly, using 
peripheral vision. Nothing. A raw 
field ahead. Low, shiny-leafed 
bushes. A hooting call, fading. 

All this because Angela and the 
children refused to stay pinned in 
the past, in that Paradise where 
choice had fled. 

“I’ll move up to the Stet key,” I 
whispered to Majumbdahr. He nod- 
ded. 

I wriggled forward, mud’s liquid 
fingers tugging. Ten meters, then 
twenty. The stubby box winked an 
orange indicator when I inserted the 
signet. I fumbled with the Fire- 



tongue Stet and snicks d it into the re- 
ceiver. Rigid geometry among a sea 
of mud. 

Orange winked to red. Rejection. 

Not the winking red that sprang 
an alarm, though. The key 
mechanism knew this was a legiti- 
mate Fleet Stet. But not the correct 
one. 

Majumbdahr crawled up behind 
me. He saw the red dot. “That’s 
the current Stet,” he whispered, 
unbelieving. “It was on the Farri- 
ken.” 

“Right.” 

“Tonji must’ve known we’d have 
it.” 

“Right.” 

“So he’s changed the Firetongue 
over to some other scheme.” 

I nodded. Recoding the Stet 
entry-point by entry-point was a 
huge job. Tonji hadn’t had time for 
that yet. So he must have used 
some fallback Stet. That way the 
change took only hours. 

Majumbdahr had followed the 
same chain of reasoning. “That’s 
that,” he said. “Let’s get out of 
here.” 

“No. Wait.” I rummaged 
through the equipment bag. If 
Gharma had loaded everything in 
my quarters — 

“Here.” I fished out the Stet I 
had kept from my earlier commis- 
sion. 

“Where did you get that?” 

“A keepsake. Now if Tonji did 
the easiest thing — ” The change in 
Stets had been made a year or two 
before. There were undoubtedly 
some older Stets around. But a man 
in a hurry . 

Snick. Orange. Orange. Wink: 
green.

“Damn!” Majumbdahr grinned. 
★ * ★ 



We walked and crawled the klick, 
slow and easy. No fire flashed out 
of apparent nothingness to lash us 
down. 

Most of Mindoro was dark. We 
slipped from shadow to shadow. 

Nothing moved. Where were the 
patrols? Had Fleet cut back so far 
they no longer had troops for their 
bases? I remembered the ancient 
-quotation in script above the 
Toshogu Shrine: All the flowers of 
all the tomorrows are in the seeds 
of today. But the script was 
streaked and weathered, one letter 
hanging by a single tab. There was 
no one to keep the ancient shrines. 
And for this tarnished Empire, no 
seeds of tomorrow. 

I peered around us, uneasy. 

Majumbdahr had no warning. 
There came the scrabbling of nails 
on earth. One shadow oozed into 
two and a daik form struck him. He 
pitched backward, flame gun com- 
ing up. 

The thing slashed at his gun 
hand. I heard something rip. 
Majumbdahr rolled. The thing 
snarled and bit. 

I threw myself on it. Musty damp 
fur. Nails raked my side. The thing 
turned. “Kill,” it said quite dis- 
tinctly. “Quam.” 

My strangling-wire reeled out. 
Majumbdahr moaned as jaws closed 
on his arm, legs kicked at him. 

I slipped the wire around its 
throat and jerked back. Breath 
strangled out. I jeiked again, lifting 
its throat. 



Once more — the head toppled 
away. 

It was a German Shepherd, Fifty 
kilograms of muscle and teeth and 
black hair, and all of it quite dead. 
A smart dog, genetically altered to 
know the best moment to hit us. 

I felt sick. We had learned a hard 
lesson centuries ago about tinkering 
with human genetic material. Fleet 
had no such qualms about turning 
man’s best friend into fanatic, smart 
killers. 

Three buildings away a flashlight 
bobbed. We melted into the 
shadows and worked our way to- 
ward it. The small Fleet field 
glowed in the distance. Stubby 
noses pointed toward the scum of 
sky. 

I sniffed. An acrid tinge in the 
moist air. 

“Ton! Here old fella! Ton boy!” 

But Ton boy wasn’t in the 
watchdog business any more. We 
waited for him. 

Majumbdahr was tired and angry. 
I could sense it in his ragged breath- 
ing. The dog had gnawed into 
him. It took five minutes to seal- 
and- freeze the gashes. He had to 
stay alert, so there was nothing to 
do about the pain. 

The man — a corporal — passed 
nearby. Majumbdahr stepped from 
shelter and clubbed him solidly. 

I had to use a stim tab to get the 
corporal awake. Majumbdahr meant 
business.

Pharmaceuticals are bad for the 
character. Within ten minutes Ton 
boy’s master was babbling quite 
happily about matters he’d have

rather died than give away, nor- 
mally. Luckily, he wouldn’t re- 
member any of it later. 

We searched him thoroughly and 
got his encodings for the Mindoro 
locks. Insects clicked and sang. 
Clouds rolled over. A booster burst 
orange on the field and arced away. 
Troops passed in the distance. 

The corporal called in his dogs. 
They were quite docile. One of 
them even carried on a passable 
conversation about the funny smells 
around the base tonight. We put 
them all out for the evening. 

The corporal marched his rounds 
with us beside him. Like all secur- 
ity people he knew a lot more 
than he was supposed to, most of it 
by simple deduction. 

Mindoro was on stand-down. 
Most of its troops were offworld.. 
But its area defense systems were 
second to none and that was un- 
doubtedly why Tonji had brought 
Angela here. 

The corporal was quite bleary- 
eyed, pale and drawn by the time 
we reached Central’s main building. 
He took us through most of the 
check points. Then he collapsed in 
a side corridor. Pharmaceuticals 
have their limits; so do human be- 
ings. 

Majumbdahr stayed behind. I ap- 
proached the next check point. No- 
body even glanced up. I dropped 
the pencil-sized tube. I hit my boot 
soundlessly and rolled under the 
guard’s desk. A Lieutenant looked 
at me, at my uniform, frowned. 

“Ah!” I snapped my fingers, 
grinning. “Forgot something.” 

I turned and walked away. The 
tube went skreeee-bam. I turned. 
The Lieutenant was choking, stiff- 



limbed, eyes bulging. He fell. 

Then we walked some more. 

After a series of unlabeled doors 
I motioned Majumbdahr back. I 
slapped a boring charge on a door’s 
lock. I set the tiny timer and step- 
ped a few meters away. Chuung — it 
flared orange. I eased the door 
open. 

A foul reek seeped out. A hoarse 
voice pleaded from inside. Someone 
jibbered. 

Regeln swam back to mind. I 
thrust it aside and slammed the 
door. 

We walked on quickly. 

Tonji wasn’t hard to find. His 
name was on the door. 

He looked up from a console 
when I went in. A hand convulsed, 
froze. 

He said something obscene. My 
air pistol looked at him. He didn’t 
move. 

“Get them here.” Majumbdahr 
closed the door behind us. 

“What?” 

“You knew I’d come.” 

“How did you do it?” 

“You’ve been reading your own 
press releases. This isn’t a Fleet 
base any more. We never would’ve 
made a hundred meters across a 
well-organized base,” 

Tonji stared at me, eyes jittery. 
And I suddenly saw that he was 
older. Lines around the mouth. 
Crow’s feet webbing by the eyes. 

“We’re arranging a last ditch at- 
tack,” he said with a thin voice. 
“Most of the good troops are seek- 
ing the Quam home worlds.” 

“That won’t work.” 

“Not with bastards like you suck- 
ing up to them.” 

“You don’t understand.”

“What could they possibly offer 
you, Sanjen?” 

Something in his face made me 
look away. The waters, the waters 
lapping, washing all . cleans- 
ing . renewing . 

“Get them.” 

He called to another room in 
Central. He wanted to visit the 
woman and the children. Wake 
them up, yes. 

We took a route without crossing 
a checkpoint; it was only two cor- 
ridors away. In the enameled light 
Tonji shuffled along, the usual 
bounce missing from his step. 

“You’ve been trying to keep all 
this together?” 

He nodded. He didn’t seem to 
want to talk. 

The guard was muzzy with a 
just-awakened look when we got 
there. He unkeyed the door and we 
went in. Majumbdahr stayed outside 
to keep the guard company. I had 
been using my equipment sachel to 
conceal my air pistol. When I put it 
down Angela came into the room. 
Then the children. 

“You’re all right?” I said. 

She stared, eyes wide. I asked 
again. She murmured, “My God. 
My God.” Chark said, “Daddy.” 
Romana just looked. 

I turned to Tonji. “We’re leav- 
ing.” 

He looked at me stolidly. He was 
an exhausted man and he knew he 
was going to die. 

“The roof. You’ve got a copter 
there?” 

“Ye . yes.” 

Somehow I felt as though I 
wanted to talk to this man, shake 
him into conversation. I had thought 
of smashing in that poker face a 



thousand times. My skin was dan- 
cing. I felt a jittery joy. I was radi- 
ating energy . I wanted him to protest, 
to rage, to curse me. Something to 
push against. 

After a moment I said, “Let’s 
go-” 

* * * 

We landed at the field’s tower, a 
squat three stories of rough-cut 
rock. Chark was twitching with ex- 
citement; he wanted to hold one of 
the guns. Romana is younger but 
she seemed to know better what 
was going on. She kept glancing at 
Angela. They exchanged looks of 
numb terror. “What’ll we do, 
Dad?” Chark said. 

“Stay right here.” I turned to 
him so the women were at my 
back. “Now look,” I said in a low 
whisper. “I’m leaving you to take 
care of your mother and Romana. 
Keep them in the copter. Don’t let 
them even open the hatch unless 
I’m outside.” 

“Hey, give me a gun.” 

“We can’t spare one. We’ve got 
to take the tower.” 

“Are you going to shoot that 
guy?” His forefinger jabbed at 
Tonji. 

“Never mind. I’m leaving you in 
charge here, right?” 

“Right.” 

“We’ll be back as soon as we 
can.” 

“Where’ re we going, Dad?” 

I didn’t know what to say. To the 
halo stars? 

“Hey, let me have a gun?” 
Chark asked. 

“See you in a few minutes,” I 
said.

Majumbdahr was coming out of 
some of the shock from the dog 
business. 

His arm was closing up from the 
seal-and-freeze. The blue swelling 
had gone down. He jumped on to 
the tarmac and watched Tonji get 
out. I noticed that Majumbdahr ’s 
uniform was mud-streaked and tom, 
and then that mine was, too. Fines- 
sing that by the officers in the tower 
wasn’t going to be easy. 

I turned to Angela. “Stay put.” 
“Ling-” 

“We’re going into the tower for 
a while.” 

“What will we doT' 

“When?” 

“After we leave here? The city is 
so terrible now, we — ” 

“Look, Chaik is going to keep 
his eyes open and see that nobody 
gets into this copter. Right, son?” 
“Gee, I sure would like to have a 
gun, Dad.” 

“I’m sure you would.” 

I jumped down. The three of us 
walked the hundred meters to the 
tower. Majumbdahr shouldered his 
flame gun. They could see us 
clearly from the plastiform top floor 
of the tower and we wanted to look 
like an ordinary patrol. 

“Do you think I will keep 
quiet?” Tonji said between com- 
pressed lips. “That I will ask them 
to let you have a ship?” 

“That’s exactly what I think.” 

He looked at me. I gave him a 
very thin smile. 

“I knew you had come . that 
was a Quam maneuver, destroying 
the EDS net.” 

“A byproduct, that’s all.” 

“So you think.” 



“I know rather more than you do 
about it.” 

“You didn’t simply come back 
for your family.” 

“Quite so. But you tried to use 
them against me.” 

“I had to.” 

“Did you have to send me to 
Veden without mentioning that I’d 
have to go through the Flinger?” 
“We couldn’t find an on-line 
officer who would.” 

“Uh huh.” We had reached the 
entrance. “Key us in.” 

Tonji hesitated and 1 stood there, 
letting him think about it. Then he 
fished something from his pocket 
and the entrance slid open. 

Skeleton staff again. We nodded 
to the desk officer and went up the 
slideway to the tower. Tonji was 
the biggest frog in this pond and 
nobody got in his way. 

There were three officers in the 
Operations pit. One looked up. I 
smiled. “Need a PQX for a survey 
flight.”' 

Tonji was stiff, robotlike. They 
saw him and nodded. One punched 
in a spec and handed us an encod- 
ing. “Ready, sir.” He scowled at 
my muddy uniform. 

I nodded and we left. Outside by 
the slide way, Majumbdahr said, 
“Somebody’s going to find that 
Lieutenant we left back there.” 

“I know.” 

“Even if we lift, they’ll track us 
as soon as they hear.” 

“Any ideas?” 

“Kill the power in here. We’re 
cleared, we can lift. They can’t 
track us then. 

“Right.” I looked at Tonji. 
“Where’s the inload?” 

“I don’t know.”

GALAXY 




“We don’t have time to look for 
it,” Majumbdahr said, the words 
clipped. 

“We could just shoot them,” I 
said. I didn’t want to, but I said it. 

“We could.” 

I thought. Shit, what was I doing 
here? I was on the goddamn ragged 
edge, rubbed raw, nerves skittering 
like a caged rat. If I hadn’t taken an 
hour of meditation in the jungle this 
afternoon I’d be wilted away by 
now. And now I was supposed to 
decide life and death for three Fleet 
officers who didn’t know my name. 

This was the nub, the end. 

“Wait. You go in and divert 
them. Ask a question. Tonji, you 
hold the door open when he does.” 

Mamumbdahr gave me a question- 
ing look. I waved him toward the 
doorway to the tower center. He 
opened the door and went in. Tonji 
held it ajar. I took the plastic- 
jacketed pancake from inside my 
shirt and ripped the sleeve. I wad- 
ded it along the top of the door, 
pressing the stuff around the edges. 
Majumbdahr’ s murmur came from 
inside. I finished. Tonji started to 
let go of the door. I sprang at him 
snatching at the handle. I caught it. 
I looked at him, lips drawn. He 
backed away. I was sure he knew 
what he was doing. But it could 
have been a simple error, yes. I 
shook my head. It was hard to de- 
cide. 

Majumbdahr came out. I slipped 
the door closed. The plastic goo 
jammed into place. It fit snugly, 
sticking. 

If they came out before we were 
clear, that was it. If not, we could 
tell them on the comm lines to stay 
put. It was the best I could do. 



Out, onto the tarmac. Soft air 
caressing. Insect buzz. 

We took the hundred meters at 
quick-step but my back burned all 
the same. Chaik slid open the 
hatch. “Nobody came, Dad.” 
“Good.” Into the cabin. 

We shot skyward, banked, 
coasted. I set down beside the PQX 
the tower had assigned us. I got 
Angela and the kids into the PQX 
entry and sent Majumbdahr up to 
activate ship systems. Tonji stood at 
the entry portal, silent, watching. 

“When we lift you’ll alert 
them.” 

“I doubt it.” 

“Why not?” 

“I won’t be alive.” 

“Why are you so sure?” 

“I can see your face.” 

“You always were a good judge 
of character, Tonji.” 

“Sarcasm from scum is — ” 

I raised my pistol. I thumbed it 
over to phosphorous shells. 

Tonji backed away. I sighted at 
his drawn, pale face. 

Time ticked by. 

I remembered the three guards. 

“It would be easy, all right,” I 
sighed. “Come on.” 

He stumbled away toward the 
copter, following my gesture. He 
moved like a drugged man. Once he 
was inside I would give him a satis- 
fying tap on the head and we would 
lift. 

We reached the copter. Tonji 
looked at me for directions, then 
climbed in. 

From the tower came a crump. 
“Goddamn,” I whispered. 

In the tower one viewport was 
smashed to a blind star. Behind the 
plastiform windows of the top floor

flames leaped like children wanting 
to see out. 

I jumped into the copter and clip- 
ped Tonji at the base of the skull. 
He pitched over. 

I landed running. Something 
whizzed by me. I fired three phos- 
phorus rounds in the direction of the 
tower without looking, more to 
cause night blindness than to dis- 
suade anyone. Thirty meters, 
twenty — I stopped at the ramp to 
free the securing bolts. The air siz- 
zled. A round ricocheted spang 
harmlessly off the ship. 

I turned to the ramp. Something 
hit my arm and spun me around. A 
shattering pain leaped into my 
shoulder. I, lifted my arm — lifted 
my arm — 

Something was lying on the 
ground. A hand. 

I staggered. Lifted my arm — 

Halfway between elbow and wrist 
was a black stump. 

Very carefully I bent over and 
picked up the hand. 

Blood spattered the tarmac. 

I took one step up the ramp. 
Two. So daik. 

Shouts, a hammering. 

Purple speckling in my eyes. 

So dark. 

Part VI 

A rumbling, but-deep. Metal 
smooth, so smooth I glided down it 
ice palace skating taste of winter 
slick slick so white God why’s the 
snow smell so ... So. Mouth 
gravel-dry. Skreee-hummmm. 

An eye worked open. 

Golden. 

Biting. 

I closed it. 



But no — my throat worked, rasp- 
ing. Force open the eye. 

Gold needles sticking in it. Look 
to the side. Viewport rim. Squint. 
Oiled light. Blink. The sun. Sol 
burning, rose-red, twice as old as 
time. 

“Ling?” Angela’s soft voice. 

“Ling? Try to sleep. We’ll be 
there in a few minutes.” 

I was swinging a rock. So heavy. 
Swinging it toward the flame flower 
outside, shut it out. 

“Ling! Don’t move your arm! 
You’ll jar the healant unit loose.” 
Gentle pressure. I relaxed. “Your 
officer is hiding us somehow, that’s 
what he said. So the radar below 
won’t find us.” 

“Ah.” 

“Sleep.” 

So I did.

Time. 

I floated up. Saw the ceiling. 
Knew I was aboard again. Flashed 
through dead pictures: Farriken 
hanging among the war stars, giant 
creamy ball. Zero-torque cranes and 
grapples. Clutching at our ship. 

I plunged down the Farriken ' s 
axis tube, stretcher- strapped. 

Rumble. Mumble. Drifting . 

Lancing pain. My hand. Gone. I 
felt a hollow space somewhere. A 
lifting new freedom. Struggling 
damp feelings, moist, warm, a tree 
like a cloud of leaves, breathing — 
swift and darting images — sleek 
animals running sweating in the 
cloak of rising dust — throw — 
throw — dancing dancing mad — the 
curve of spear in flight — soft warm 
moist — left gone — the voices — low 
slithering — peering eyes — dancing

And in the endless light and airy

red across the sky. Rust and 
diamonds. A shooting pain. Ah. I 
raged. I stamped down, crushing 
stars. I shouted, voice hollow . 
After a while they went away. 
Sheets, so cool. A slight finger’s 
press of gravity. Ah it was. 

Angela’s cool brow crinkling. 
Fingernails plucking at my 
sleeve . Sprinkle of yellow pain. 
I shoved a breath up through clotted 
lungs. Wheezed: “Got ...” 

Majumbdahr’s voice: “I’ve got 
new data. When he’s better ...” 

I twisted. “Got ...” 

“Quiet, now. Chemotherapy is 
cycling.” 

Time . 

Angela. Then a long time later, 
Rhandra. Hair billowing as she 
leaned over me, prickly bright 
things running through me. Soft 
silibants. Ah, women. All rest and 
refuge do they contain. 



Time. The tinkling of currents. 
Drifting. 

Two eyes. Shadowed, lurking 
beneath a cowl. The figure was a 
dark galactic arm, dust- shrouded, 
hanging in space before the stars. 
Those shrouded eyes . Eyes? 
Or — two stars? Red-bright. 

The Master. Lofting among the 
star rifts. 

From his eyes streamed blood. 

He loomed above me. I wrestled 
with the thoughts: 

He had flicked a finger and tick I 
danced, strings invisible. 

Met Rhandra. 

Studied the halo stars, dutiful. 
His master’s voice. 

Run amok at the Madi’s. Careen- 
ing through it all. 

He had turned me inside out like 
an old pocket. 

Morning’s humming nausea: his 
treatments, I knew. 

I felt a surging in my head. No 
helpful waters came to calm the 
thoughts. No restful lazy lapping, 
dissolving all. 

The vapor haze blew away. 

I remembered it all now. All the 
kneeling and bowing and washing 
in the great liquid song. 

Rage forked lightning-bright, yel- 
low. We were men , Goddamn it, 
not . not . 

I blinked. I sat up. 

My left arm was a blue sheath. A 
bioadapt unit. Inside, I knew, my 
arm swam in womb-like fluid, heal- 
ing. The hand was stored 
elsewhere, probably, awaiting a re- 
grafting. 

“Rhandra!” 

She appeared from around the 
comer of our quarters. “Ling, 
you’re not supposed to be awake.” 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

“Something woke me up.” 
“Well, I’ve tried to be quiet 
but—” 

“No, something I was think- 
ing I frowned. Dreaming? 

But the tightness in my muscles re- 
mained. Anger was boiling up from 
my unconscious. I felt myself 
caught in it, in the swirl of a blind 
tide. 

I shook my head. “What . how 
are the others?” 

“Fine. I met your family. Ling, I 
think we ought to talk — ” 

“Later. Later. I don’t . 
Majumbdahr, how’s he?” 

"All right . He s wonting on 
something. Angela said he came to 
see you about some readouts.” 
“When was that?” 

“Yesterday.” 

“Yesterday! Why haven’t we 
Jumped?” 

“We have.” 

“How far?” 

“A short distance. A . parsec, 
isn’t that the word?” 

“Yes. Yes, it is. Fleet can still 
pick us up at this range, if we’re 
unlucky.” 

“Well, Gharma said he didn’t 
want to risk going further.” 

“Why not?” 

“He doesn’t understand all the 
changes you made in the Jump sub- 
systems, he said. I think that was 
the right phrase.” She looked at 
me, concern tightening her features. 
“Ling, I think you should rest.” 
“No.” 

“You almost died. If 
Majumbdahr hadn’t gotten that 
freeze capsule on you — ” 

“I know. I know.” I waved the 
subject away with a weak right 
hand. “My hand will live?” 



“They say.” 

“How sure are they?” 

She cupped a palm to my face. 
“They said the chances are good. 
Don’t worry, Ling.” 

“Who’s this ‘they’, anyway?” 

“A doctor. They unsealed a vault 
to extract him. We didn’t have any- 
one who could deal with your 
case.” 

I lay back. “I see.” 

“That’s right, Ling. Rest. 
Sleep.” 

I blinked drowsily. “Sure 
. .oh, would you do something? 
Go and ask Gharma for a read- 
out of our Jump sequence. I’ll 
need that to comDUte the lon<* 
Jump.” 

“Rest, first.” 

“No, get it now. That way I’ll be 
able to work on it when I wake up 
again.” 

She nodded and helped me lie 
back. I tried not to wince. Sheets of 
pain shot up my arm. That meant 
the locals were wearing off. But it 
also meant my head was clearing. 

She arranged my pillows and dim- 
med the phosphors. Veden phos- 
phors, I noticed — I was wearing my 
contacts again. 

She stepped softly. I heard her 
click the latch on her way out. 

For a long moment I thought of 
just lying there. It was clean and 
flat and the sheets smelled sweet as 
the wind. The Paradise Milton had 
scribbled about and never gotten. 

But then the rage seized me 
again. The blazing star-eyes. I sat 
up. I pulled the covers away. No 
pajamas. Good; they would’ve stuck 
out under my robe, anyway. 

I braced myself with my right 
arm. My legs swung over the side. 



106 



GALAXY 




My arm buckled. I toppled back- 
wards on the bed. My left arm 
shrieked at me. 

I rolled over onto my right side. 
Painfully I worked myself upright 
by pressing upward with my hand 
and rocking my legs in synchroniza- 
tion. 

Then I stood up. And sat down, 
knees buckling. 

The second time I lurched 
sidewise and caught a deck chair for 
support. I breathed a little and tried 
not to think too much. Then I took 
a step. The mists inside lifted a bit. 
I stepped again and nearly lost my 
balance. I waited some more. 
Another step, wobbly but workable. 

I reached the closet in slow mo- 
tion. Fishing out my robes took 
time. By then I was concerned that 
Rhandra would return. So I hurried, 
and very nearly fell. I caught my- 
self against the wall and just sucked 
in the soft, soft air for a while. Fi- 
nally I found my Captain’s belt and 
wrapped it around the quilted robes. 

Time for a walk. 

I made my way to B deck with- 
out seeing anyone. I began to feel 
stronger, steadier. Majumbdahr 
lived in a small staff officer’s cabin. 
I wanted to see him where we 
wouldn’t be disturbed, even by 
Rhandra. I hoped he would be in 
quarters. If not, I’d locate him on 
the inboard comm line and have 
him meet me there. 

There was no response to my 
knock. I listened to the sighing of 
Farriken's air circulators. No 
movement inside. I used my Cap- 
tain’s key. 

I was wrong. He was there. 

He swayed gently in the air cur- 
rents. Blood dripped steadily from 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 




him and spattered red the deck. 

Mahesh Majumbdahr had been 
trussed expertly. Knees bent. An- 
kles bound. Wrists wired and ooz- 
ing blood behind his back. He hung 
face down. Bright scarlet threads 
laced him. Flexible tubing linked 
knots at wrists and ankles. Ship’s 
cord bisected the tubing. The cord 
looped through the air duct over- 
head. 

Blood now filming over to a 
muddy brown made an X in his 
chest. It sliced his coverall and cut 
deep into the abdomen. His face — I 
looked away. 

I recognized this vaguely from 
my reading of Veden history. A 
ritual Bengali execution. Usually 
performed with a shortsword. In an- 
cient times it symbolized a neces- 
sary death, a sad but unavoidable 
passage . 

I stood and looked at him a 
while. Then I began a search. There 
was no sign of a sword. An empty 
fax folder yawned open on the 
floor; a few books were disarrayed. 
I found a small wire cutter and cut 
the ship’s cord. I caught the body 
as it fell free. Pain lanced my left 
arm. The body slipped away from 
me and sprawled. I covered the 
face. 

From the blood clotting I judged 
he had been dead at least half an 
hour. With head wounds the brain 
damage from oxygen loss would be 
extensive already. No chance to 
save him. 

I punched on the comm. Rhandra 
answered on the second buzz. 
“Ling! Where are you? When I — ” 

“Are you alone?” 

“Yes.” I gave her the cabin 
number and asked her to come. 

108 



Alone. 

I sank down the bed. I waited. I 
watched the lake of scarlet around 
him scum over with a ruddy, used 
brown. This was no longer 
Majumbdahr, only a butchered side 
of meat. 

A part of me skittered away from 
this room thick with sullen air and I 
remembered the walks we’d taken 
together, an impossibly long time 
ago now. We walked through slip- 
pery mulch of packed leaves, along 
chattering streams. Ferns. Soft 
stands of scented weeds. Rasping 
briars. Our boots thumped in the 
hush of woods. We talked. We 
worked up the dry, cottony taste in 
the mouth which chilled water cuts 
as a knife. The valleys of Veden’ s 
great plateau cupped us beneath a 
spitting blue sun. Time hung still 
and silent in the fragile air. And as 
this memory hazed my mind I lay 
back on the bed and knew at once 
that I hated this artificial place now. 
It was a warren of cushioned sounds 
inside a metal box, an artifact I had 
memorized into a profound disgust, 
a craft whose prime purpose was an 
Empire where both the police and 
the poor were polite. Yet on the 
other side was, inexplicably, the 
thing lying in its own muddy 
pool . 

Rhandra’ s rap startled me. I 
creaked up and opened the door. 

She said and did the things I’d 
expected. It all went by in a curious 
milky green light. Words slid into 
more words. There was sand in my 
eyes. Gritty bags were pulling down 
on my eyelids and blurring into a 
drone Rhandra’ s sentences. A hand 
shook me. I sucked in air. The light 
cleared a little. 



GALAXY 




“Look . for . stim.” 
“What?” she said. “Oh.”— and 
went into the small bathroom. Time 
slid along. A prickling feeling in 
my face. “Ling!” Another slap. 
“Here — ” Hiss. Cool spot on my 
wrist. She took the stimulant injec- 
tion tube away. I blinked. A faint 
tingling seeped back into my body. 
In a moment I felt somewhat bright 
and clear again. 

“God, I’m weak.” 

“Of course. And to find 
this . ” 

We sat for a moment. “I’ll call,” 
she said. “We’ll get some help.” 
“No.” 

“Well, whoever did this must 
be—” 

“No!” 

She sat silently. I struggled to 
think clearly. I noticed something 
new on the bed. “ Where ’d those 
come from.” 

“What? Oh, those must be the 
readouts he wanted to talk to you 
about. Plus the other things in your 
Captain’s input slot on the bridge.” 
“The fax folder.” I gestured. 
She handed it to me. It was identic 
cal to the empty one lying on the 
floor. I opened it. 

“Ling, I don’t see how you can 
sit there calmly opening your mail 
for God’s sakes, with — ” 

“Quiet.” I flipped through the 
faxes inside. “I wonder ...” 
“What?” 

“This is the same type of fax 
folder as that one. Maybe 
Majumbdahr had two copies of 
something, and left one in my slot 
so I’d get it when I was able.” 

“Oh. And the other copy . .” 
“Somebody took it.” 

Rhandra’s face was compressed 



and rigid. She kept looking back 
over her shoulder at the body. 

“These are faxes of a correlation 
analysis. Majumbdahr wanted to do 
a better study of the Veden mass 
detector data. He left it as an 
available-time job for Farriken ' s 
computers.” 

Rhandra looked at me apprehen- 
sively. “Ling, I really do think 
you’re too tired to . 

“Come on.” I got up. 

“Where?” 

“Just come on.” 

I locked the door behind us. I 
walked as quickly as I could 
through the curved corridors, watch- 
ing for anyone else. Most of the 
crew was probably stowing the cold- 
sleep vaults; securing them 
adequately in the axial pods would 
probably take a full day. We 
stopped at an officer’s cabin I chose 
at random and I clicked it open. 

Inside^ I spread the faxes on a 
narrow bunk. Majumbdahr had used 
the satellite data to get a refined 
parallax fix on mass and velocity. I 
pointed at a display fax. “It’s big, 
all right. About a tenth Jupiter 
mass. Now, the velocity ...” 

I checked it. 

Checked it again. 

“What’s wrong, Ling? Why are 
you looking that way?” 

‘ ‘This thing — whatever it is — will 
hit Jagen. Not Lekki. Jagen.” 

“I see,” she said, not seeing. 

“He integrated the trajectory out. 
Look.” The dashed line of the pro- 
jected path swerved neatly around 
Lekki and arrowed precisely into 
Jagen.” 

“Why is that so important?” 

“It’s just about impossible. Lekki 
has more than twice Jagen’ s mass. 

\ 



THE STARS IN SHROUD 



109 




Its gravitational potential well is 
much broader. Any random frag- 
ment zooming out of interstellar 
space would have one chance in a 
million of hitting anything. Even if 
it did, Lekki is much more probable 
a target. But Jagen! — a little dot 
whirling around at near-light 
speeds? Impossible.” 

“But it has happened.” 

“Yes.” Suddenly I remembered 
the Master’s voice long ago: The 
ancient Quarn left giant devices 
. they could move a planet 
through Jump space . 

“When it impacts, Jagen will 
shred that mass with its tidal forces. 
Rip it to atoms. Then heat it up. 
X-rays. Gammas.” 

I didn’t need to check 
Majumbdahr’s faxes to know that 
Veden would be within the cone of 
emission. The planet would fry. 
And the ramscoops, irradiated be- 
yond use. The storehouse of the 
Empire, burned away. 

“What will it do?” 

“Ever watch a time-lapsed 3D of 
a supernova? This is like a pocket 
edition. The radiation will fry Ve- 
den. Probably kill all higher life 
forms.” 

“But Ling — ” 

“I know,” I said bleakly, watch- 
ing the horror crinkle her eyes. 
“And I know who caused it.” 
“What. ?” 

“The Quam.” 

“I don’t believe that. Neither do 
you.” 

“Ah, but I do. Rhandra, the 
Master didn’t want Majumbdahr and 
I to stay down on the surface, to be 
out of touch. He wanted us around 
for our regular session with him. 
Balm for die mind. Those wonder- 



ful washing waters. That’s how he 
has managed us like a Punch and 
Judy farce from the beginning.” 

Her face became stony. ‘Wo, 
I . .1 . .” 

I watched her struggle with it. 
“Rhandra. I know you’re confused 
by this. I know something of what 
you feel. I felt it, too.” 

“But ling . .” 

“I want you to help me. I’m 
going to go see the Master. Perhaps 
I’m wrong,” I said, knowing I 
damned well wasn’t. “We can only 
find out what is behind all this by 
speaking to the Master.” 

“Yes . .” 

“But we must be careful. Who- 
ever killed Majumbdahr can do the 
same to us. So I want you to help 
me. Will you?” 

“Of course. But ... the Mas- 
ter . .” Her face twisted. 

“I know. We—” 

The comm speaker sounded a 
soft, persistent beep: an all-stations 
message. 

“Officer Gharma respectfully re- 
quests the Captain’s presence in the 
Master’s rooms. Officer Gharma re- 
spectfully ...” 

I listened to it repeat five times. 
A slow, wan smile spread across 
my face. 

“So it’s Gharma.” 

“Why are you so sure?” Rhandra 
murmured, her voice reedy. 

“He wouldn’t call if he hadn’t al- 
ready checked our quarters. And if 
there’s ship business, why not 
summon me to the bridge?” 

“Well, he might—” 

“No. No, it’s Gharma. He has a 
taste for the ancient Veden prac- 
tices. And there is something in him 
I have always sensed.”

“Well . what shall we do, 
Ling?” 

“Do? We go see Mr. Gharma, 
just as he asks.’’

We went two corridors laterally, 
along the gentle curve of the ship, 
before I caught a flicker of motion 
out of the comer of my eye. A head 
jerked back around a turn in the 
hallway. 

“Run,” I said. Rhandra’s 
shortbreech gave her ample room 
for her long legs; she easily outdis- 
tanced me. I puffed along, thoughts 
racing. “Left, I called. We turned 
and there ahead was the dim gray 
light I sought. The priests had left a 
third of the B deck phosphors un- 
treated; they gleamed with Sol light. 
Vedens with adapted eyes could 
make their way here, but they could 
see no further than fifty meters. I 
popped my contact filters into my 
palm. 

Rhandra slowed. “Where should 
we go?” 

“Not back to our quarters, that’s 
certain. This way.” 

I soon found it. The emergency 
arms locker went ting and eased 
open beneath my Captain’s encoder. 
I fetched out stun guns and laser 
pistols, hitched them in my belt. I 
gave Rhandra a stun weapon. I 
showed her how it worked. “Don’t 
even aim it at anyone unless you’re 
going to use it.” 

“What setting shall I use?” She 
fingered the dial in its butt. 

“Here. Stun. It won’t kill.” 

“But if we need — ” 

“Come on.” 

The cushioned floors of B deck 



were the thickest in the ship. They 
muffled our running. I cut over 
three corridors and peered around. 
There — a bulging green color- 
coded hemisphere, down a short 
passageway. 

It clicked open, revealing a tangle 
of power lines, connector boards, 
microswitches, alternate circuit ele- 
ments and inloading sequencers. I 
studied them. 

The routine shipboard elements 
disconnected easily. The manual 
override net took more time. I took 
a cutter from the tool wall inside 
and slashed crude gashes in the 
plasti board. 

The lights around us faded, 
pulsed once and died. A rattling 
alarm spoke nearby. I cut some 
more and it stopped. 

“Ling, I can’t see.” 

“That’s the idea. I haven’t lived 
this long by walking into situations 
with long odds against me.” 

“What does it matter if we’re all 
in, the dark?” 

“Those small round splotches — 
no, sorry, you can’t make them out, 
can you?’ ’ 

She squinted. “No.” 

“Those are emergency phos- 
phors. They’re running lights that 
go on when central power fails. 
Farriken has a separate power 
source for each deck.” 

“The Priests didn’t paint them 
with Veden phosphors?” 

“They didn’t know what they 
were. The emergency system is just 
bright enough for an Earth native to 
see by. But to you they’re emitting 
in the wrong part of the 
spectrum — too red.” 

“All the Veden natives are blind 
now,” she murmured slowly.

“On B deck, yes. That’s all we 
need.” 

But how long did we have it? 

The bridge officer was busy 
supervising storage of the vaults, I 
was pretty sure. He was probably 
frowning at his readout panel right 
now, trying to figure why the B 
phosphors should fail. Did he have 
an extra hand who could come 
down and troubleshoot, carrying a 
hand flash? 

I started along the corridor, lead- 
ing Rhandra. 

“Where are we going?” 

“Tramping into the vineyard 
where the grapes of wrath are 
stored,” I said. My head had lifted 
lightly from my shoulders and 
floated a meter high. 

“What?” 

“A snippet of ancient culture. 
Non-Mongul.” 

Through the curved lattice, all 
padded and restful: officer’s coun- 
try. Near the Master’s suite the war- 
ren was more complex, for an 
added sense of isolation from the 
rigid pattern of shipboard. This 
made it easier to approach, since no 
one could hope to hear us. 

I saw the first priest two intersec- 
tions away from the Master’s area. 

He stood with his back turned, 
arms raised as though talking into a 
wall ship’s comm. As I watched he 
slammed the receiver down, felt his 
way a few meters along the wall 
and stopped. He had just found that 
the comm ran on the same power 
source as the phosphors and 
wouldn’t work either. And, being 
untrained, he didn’t know an 
emergency comm station was re- 
cessed in the wall forty meters away. 

“Ling, I . .” 



I tugged her back around the 
comer. "What?" 

“I’ve got to ask something. How 
long will it be before that . 
thing . collides with Jagen?” 
“About ten days.” 

“Then there’s no hope of stop- 
ping it? Or saving people?” 

“No. Or . wait . We can 
send a signal. Maybe they can get 
deep enough underground.” I 
thought. “Yes, that’s right. Ten 
meters of dirt would shield them.” 
“But there’s no hope other- 
wise?” 

“No.” 

“Then let me go to the bridge. I 
can tell them. Before we . see 
Gharma.” 

I grimaced. “I know how you 
feel, Rhandra,” I whispered, “but 
you won’t be safe on the bridge. 
Gharma wouldn’t leave it uncov- 
ered. If you appear there they’ll 
stop you. Kill you, probably. They 
don’t seem much interested in dis- 
cussions, not when there’s a 
shorts word handy.” 

She looked very solemn and nod- 
ded. Things were moving too 
quickly for her. Hell, I thought 
woozily, they’re moving too 
damned fast for me, too. 

We cut to the right and circled 
around the priest. I spotted three 
others, each at an intersection. They 
had taken up positions roughly 
equidistant from the Master’s suite. 
They blocked all paths to it. 

But they’d made a simple tactical 
error. They were too far apart. The 
intersections were all over fifty 
meters from each other. In B deck’s 
hushed corridors that was more than 
enough to isolate them. They’d 
formed their net in virtual darkness;

given time they would probably cor- 
rect it. 

“You’re going to follow me at a 
few paces behind. Here — ” I reeled 
ships cord from around my waist. 
I’d taken it from the emergency 
locker. “You can hold this as a 
guide. If the Veden phosphors sud- 
denly go back on you’ll have to 
drag me out of sight. I’ll be blinded 
even worse than you and the 
priests.” 

I paused. Gharma might have 
sent a man to the bridge, letting 
him feel his way out of B deck, 
with word to bring flares or any- 
thing else that emitted the Veden 
spectrum. In that case aid might 
come any second; there had been 
enough time. 

But if Gharma was cautious he 
might well keep all his priests with 
him for protection. He could wait 
me out that way with less risk. 

Which had he done? Flip a coin, 
Sanjen. 

“Damn,” I fretted. “Look, I’ve 
got another idea. I’ll lead you to 
almost within sight of one of the 
priests. These stun weapons are too 
noisy; the others will hear. So I’ll 
double around and come at him 
from another direction. Wait about 
a minute, then make a small noise. 
I’ll rush him.” 

“What sort of noise?” 

She looked suddenly frightened. 
Well, so what? I was, too. But I 
was more angry than scared, or else 
I wouldn’t be here. 

“Just a few words. A question. 
Ask him why the lights are out. 
He’ll probably think you’re just 
wandering around in the dark.” 

“I am.” 

“Quiet.” We edged along the 



passageway for a moment until I 
could just make out a priest around 
the next comer. “Here I go. Count 
the seconds in your head.” 

I raced around to the other cor- 
ridor. To me these halls were 
pooled with wan reddish light, dim 
but enough. I crept forward until I 
had a clear view of the priest’s 
flowing maquanan robes, and 
stopped. He was shifting uneasily 
from foot to foot. Unnerving, to 
stand within easy laser shot of an 
armed and still have to force your- 
self closer. Several times he looked 
directly at me. 

I froze. His gaze drifted on with- 
out pause. Precisely how dim was 
this light to him? 

Step, wait, step, wait. 

My left arm spoke with a low, 
pulsing ache. I inched forward, 
handgun covering the priest. A 
thousand years ago I had sat in a 
restaurant with Mahesh Majumbdahr 
and talked of reverence for life, re- 
spect for living creatures. Now I 
was preparing myself to kill a man 
simply because he blocked my way. 
Faintly: “Why are — ” 

I ducked low. Lunged forward. 
The priest turned, robes swirling, 
his pistol coming up, eyes shifting 
uneasily as he tried to locate Rhand- 
ra’s voice. 

“ — the lights — ” 

At the last moment he did. The 
pistol leveled. He squinted down 
the V-and-blade sight. Finger 
squeezing — 

“ — all out?” 

I hit him with a boot heel in the 
shoulder. It was a high kick I 
hadn’t tried in years. I caught; he 
staggered sidewise. His finger slip- 
ped from the trigger. 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

Right foot back to the deck. I fol- 
lowed the weight shift through with 
a short chop to his neck. Breathe 
out, focus down, turn — 

I twisted, caught his solar plexus 
with my left elbow. A biting pain 
shot up into my shoulder. 

Wind whooshed out of him. I 
moved in, butted him aside — 
winced — and snatched at the pistol. 

Fumble, fumble — I suddenly 
thought that a laser beam could be 
seen quite easily by Veden eyes, 
alerting the priests — I got it. 

I clubbed him with the butt. He 
sagged to the deck. 

I froze. No sound. The hollow 
sigh of air circulators. 

I dragged the priest into a cabin 
and locked him in. When I went 
back for Rhandra she was jittery, 
but she listened carefully to what I 
told her. 

The Master’s suite. I cracked the 
door ajar. Silence. We slipped into 
near-daikness. A dim emergency 
phosphor glowed red beyond the 
antechamber. 

Suddenly a chant rang out. 
Voices joined it. A singsong wail 
echoed over us. Tapping drum, 
chiming cymbals. 

The beaded curtain before us 
swayed and rattled in currents that 
bore the sweet tang of incense. 

We slipped through. 

Four Lengen priests sat in zazen 
position before the Master. None 
were armed. The wavering music 
spun on. On. On. 

And stopped, as though sliced by 
a sword. 

“Leave us now.” The Master 
turned his cowled head toward us. 

“I believe we have some busi- 
ness.” 



“It awaits you. Outside.” 

“You’ll get no help from them.” 
He paused. “Leave us now.” 

Of all receptions I had imagined, 
being brushed off wasn’t one of 
them. I sat, and gestured Rhandra 
to do the same. 

“Gharma has erred again.” His 
voice rolled out, deep and somber. 

“Because those priests didn’t get 
us?” 

“I knew it was you when the il- 
lumination failed.” 

“I expected Gharma here.” 

“He is dispatched elsewhere. To 
complete the circle.” 

The priests began to murmur a 
slow rhythmic chant. We talked 
over it. “More murder?” 

The Master clasped his hands and 
said nothing. 

“Why did Gharma kill 
Majumbdahr?’ ’ 

“We only hastened him by an 
hour.” 

“To stop him from warning Ve- 
den?” Rhandra said abruptly. 

“In part. My hand rests only 
lightly on such matters.” 

“Looks like a dead weight to 
me,” I said bitterly. But something 
restrained me from approaching 
him. I sat. “Why kill the Vedens? 
An entire planet ?” 

“A point of . there is no 
word. Let this suffice: millions of 
your years ago we caused the neu- 
tron star to wind inward. We did 
this in the last phase of . matter 
shaping. Then we retreated to the 
next of the . .” 

“The halo stars.” 

“You would call them so. They 
are true center. The sum.” 

“Then why don’t you damned 
well stay there?” I spat out.

GALAXY 




“A star does not ask the galaxy 
why it spins.” 

“/ am asking.” 

“So.” He joined in the murmur- 
ing warm chant for a moment. His 
great head bowed. Incense 
sweetened the air. 

“We returned this last time to the 
disk. We looked upon our works. 
The neutron star was infested. The 
ancients timed that star for our use. 
You had begun to spread. To have 
festered so, to take our works and 
turn them to a purpose we had 
planned for ourselves . We knew 
then that the legacy we had planned 
was rotted. Spoiled. You — our 
children — were now rivals.” 
“How?” 

“You violate the Precepts.” 

“Piss on sour Precepts. Why 
should they apply to us?” 

“One always knows one’s chil- 
dren better than they know them- 
selves.” 

“What. ?” Rhandra asked. 
“We made you,” His voice 
boomed. “Made hunters, learners, 
from eaters of fruit. Hormones. 
Mating ritual. Family grouping. All 
bear our imprint.” 

“No . .” 

He shook his head wearily. His 
voice floated across to us. “We do 
not know why the great old ones 
did this. A last groping. For a vis- 
ion. I do not kenne ... it lies to us 
to right the errors.” 

“By tinkering with us?” I almost 
shouted. “Your damnable Plague? 
The men you’ve killed — or made 
me kill?” 

“To complete the circle.” 

“How? Was it that business I 
studied about left hemisphere versus 
right? You had me read that, didn’t

you?” 

“I erred. It vexed you, to direct 
your knowledge in these paths. I 
see now I erred often with you. My 
first decision was correct.” 

“The winged man?” 

“Yes. I saw you would be a 
threat. My charge was to bring the 
sickness to Veden.” 

“ You caused the violence. The 
riots.” 

“A facet of the design. You 
might have interfered.” 

“So you ordered me killed. What 
made you stop trying?” 

“The craft that brought you to 
Veden sent a message packet.” 
“That’s customary.” 

“Gharma read it that evening. 
Too late for me to stop the winged 
follower. It told of the Patanen. 
They were to assemble on Earth. I 
saw we would need you to take us 
there when the time came.” 

“So you gave me a stay of 
execution.” 

“Remember, when you think 
these harsh things, my aim?” Hand 
passes. A misty low voice. 

The priests. Their candences 
swelled in the dry light. A sea’s 
green sameness washed the room. 
Metallic flutterings veined the air. 

A distant twinge from my left 
hand. I willed it to silence. 

“I . .” 

“To seek the rightful stations for 
us all. Bring the essence in us to 
rest.” 

“But we ... ” 

“We share a destiny.” 

Swaying, I pondered. “What 
paths lie open. ?” 

“There remains only the Path of 
Last Things.” 

“The Patanen?” 



115 




“They were the remaining part of 
you who would survive. It is a 
measure of our fall that only with 
difficulty can we snuff out our an- 
cestors’ dark legacy.” 

Chiming. Swimming in the waves 
of the chant. “That is our station?” 
The Master’s hand moved over a 
small black metal object. 

A sadness welled from him. His 
great eyes transfixed me. “I speak 
to the tension in you. It is the im- 
purity. Without it you would have 
been a fitting testament to us. We 
know you in the core. Where the 
animal mind gropes for exit.” 

“I . .” Drifting. 

Arm aching. 

I struggled to hold on to some- 
thing. 

“It is the final act. To earn my 
Walking.” 

“No . .” 

“I am charged to this task. 
Others of us labor on your distant 
worlds to bring about this consum- 
mation.” 

“Ah . I . .” 

“We erase the errors made by 
our passing. We leave no blemish 
smudged upon the galaxy.” 

The waters, they encased me. 
Their soft lapping swept clean the 
abiding tension I felt. Tapping of 
drum. Flickering ghost images. I 
struggled against the current. They 
were warm, so warm . 

Humming. Humming, the wailing 
singing waters washed over me — 
My left arm. Sheets of pain 
lanced up. Clouds thinned. 

Left hand. Right hand. 
Voicesvoices — hand — swelling ten- 
sion — 

Something within me clenched 
my fist. My hand — 

116 



Orange carved the night. 

The Master toppled. He fell 
stiffly, surprise frozen in his depth- 
less eyes. A red splotch stained his 
barrel chest. 

Left hand spoke. Right hand an- 
swered. We would not go meekly 
into their vast night. 

The being who had brought me 
such comfort as I had never known 
sprawled, eyes open to a final 
blindness. 

The rasping sound was my own 
crying. 

The room bulged and melted and 
ran down my face. 

I lurched away, out. 

3 

On the bridge. 

I fought the deep trough of sleep. 
The bridge swelled, paused and 
then collapsed, like the lungs of a 
great animal. 

“Stim,” I croaked to Rhandra. 
She pressed the hissing spergent to 
my arm. 

“Gharma. Where’s Gharma?” 

“He is suited up, working in the 
tube, sir.” The bridge officer, Has- 
sat, blinked at me. 

“How long?” 

“Nearly an hour.” 

“With a team?” 

“He took some priests.” 

“Ah.” I thought. The bridge 
went peep and click. 

“Are all the priests armed, Cap- 
tain?” Hassat said, fie was worried. 
When the power returned to B deck 
he had gotten a call from me to 
send a squad. There had been shoot- 
ing. Two wounded, one dead. All 
this, and he didn’t understand what 



GALAXY 




it was about. 

“I expect so.” 

“Sir, if you want me to go after 
him . .” 

“I do. And I’m going with you.” 
★ ★ ★ 

We were in the suiting room 
when the fist of Shiva shook the 
ship. It slammed me into a bulk- 
head. A loose tool cracked into my 
helmet. I staggered, fell. 

‘ The viewport into the axial tube 
spanned ten meters in the ceiling of 
the suiting room. I peered up at it. 

■ Silently, a waterfall swept by. 

“They’ve blown the tube wall,” 
I said over suit mike. 

“Bridge here, Captain!” a metal- 
lic voice rattled. “We monitor a 
seven meter diameter incursion in 
the tube. It’s filling fast.” 

The greenish fluid gushed by the 
port, churning. Bubbles danced. 

“Where?” 

“Fifty-two meters above the re- 
tainer, Captain. Aft.” 

My team was coasting up toward 
the viewport, gaping, apparently un- 
injured. I let myself go slack, ig- 
nored the sleeting ache as my left 
hand tired to talk to me, and 
thought. A picture of the Farriken 
hung in my mind’s eye: a spinning 
ball. The axial tube lanced through 
it. All turned, making centrifugal 
gravity and stirring the reaction fuel 
that filled the ball. The axis was a 
thin tube where it broke the ball’s 
surface, but at the ship’s center the 
tube bulged: decks A through K. I 
was in the innermost part of the 
bridge. Where the bulge tapered 
down was the retaining sheath. It 
supported the Farriken’ s center 



against the pressure of the reaction 
fluids. Further out, beyond the re- 
tainer, sacks of cargo hung from the 
tube, immersed in die fluids. 

Where was Gharma? 

Near the hole he’d blown, prob- 
ably. Not in the tube — as the watery 
colloids rushed in, the currents 
would’ve smashed him to ketchup. 
No, flooding the tube was a diver- 
sion. It gave him time. We would 
have trouble making our way long 
the tube. The delay might be vital. 
So . 

There was no place else to go. 
He had to be outside the tube, in 
the reaction fluid. 

I sighed and found I had closed 
my eyes. It was restful here at 
nearly zero g. If I could sleep a bit, 
everything would become clear . 

I slammed my left arm into the 
deck. 

Agony. 

The voices. They woke me. 

Why flood the tube? It wouldn’t 
disable Farriken . 

No, Gharma was on his feverish 
way to something else. 

“Hassat! Into the lock.” 

The Veden phosphors gave the 
rushing waters a greenish cast. The 
rippling currents had become slug- 
gish. 

“Tube is filled, Captain,” the 
metal voice rang. 

I hitched on a tool belt and snag- 
ged a laser sidearm into it. “Cycle 
us in,” I called. 

Hassat and the men listened to 
my conjectures as the air pumped 
out. The greenish fluid frothed in 
and stilled. I waved us out. We 
swam like the first fish, awkward 
and bulky. Ping, pressure balanc- 
ing. 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

Aft, along the tube. Machines, 
pod equipment, grapples — they 
bobbed in the currents set up by ro- 
tation of the tube walls. The men 
swam faster than I could. They 
were earnest and devoted followers 
of the Master, unaware of how the 
alien had used their own evolution 
against them. I had sent Rhandra to 
search the Master’s suite, remem- 
bering the black device in his hand, 
to find poly tonal inducers, sublimi- 
nal flicker screens, a host of de- 
vices. Probes into the depths of our 
competing three brains. Paths to en- 
lightenment, surely; I knew that. 
Paths to a prison, just as certainly. 

These men would follow my or- 
ders despite their confusion. And in 
time, as the tinkering wore off, as it 
had for Majumbdahr and me on 
Earth, they would return to what- 
ever it meant to be human. Merely 
human. 

We thrashed on. The section 
numbers coasted by. 16 H. The 
tube necked down here. Collars of 
steel yoked the spot: the retaining 
wall. Here the storage sacks began. 
Their access ports punctuated the 
tube walls at regular intervals, re- 
ceding into the murky distance. 
Swimming here was not much dif- 
ferent from negotiating in air, since 
there was no gravity. But normally 
one could see from one end of the 
tube to the other. Now all faded 
into green depths. I felt sluggish. 
The waters plucked at each motion 
with liquid fingers. 

“Slow down,” I called. Foxes to 
the hunt. 

Docking equipment swung lazily 
ahead of us. I peered, squinting. 
There: a ragged tear in the thick or- 
ganiform. An explosion had ripped 

118 



through from outside. 

Something tugged at my atten- 
tion. I turned, studying the tube. 
The others surged ahead toward the 
tear. 

It was small, innocuous. A gray 
patch clinging to the tube wall. 

I swerved and kicked toward a 
grappling module. “Cover!” 

I snagged the edge of the mod- 
ule. 

Crump. A muffled jolt. Frags 
spun past me. I hugged the module 
like a lost love. 

Crump. The module bucked, 
began to drift. 

I hung on. 

A corporal coasted into view. His 
back was smashed. 

I swam toward him. His suit life 
indicators read zero. 

Two others floated nearby. Dead, 
all. Bubbles oozed from their suits, 
filmed in red. 

The limpet mines had sprayed the 
area with shrapnel. Neatly timed. 
Ghanma must’ve been able to see 
our approach . How? 

I rotated, fanning the waters. The 
viewports. They looked out on the 
cargo sacks, to aid in loading. 

“Captain.” Hassat appeared from 
behind a quantat casing. “They’re 
all . .” 

“Right.” I thrashed over to a 
viewport. 

Lamps glowed blue in the murk. 

They were inside a sack. It hung 
down, a teardrop ballooning away 
from the tube. Dim figures moved 
inside. It was the sack nearest the 
retainer. 

I watched, thinking. The figures 
seemed to be sitting on top of some 
coldsleep vaults. They were per- 
forming a ceremony much like the 



GALAXY 




Master’s. The Hour of Last Things. 

“If there are more mines in 
here,” Hassat began, “We 
should — ” 

“Right. Out — through the hole.” 

I pushed away and kicked awk- 
wardly. Cold seeped into my bones; 
the reaction fluid was a colloid to 
prevent its freezing at the low 
temperatures it reached in flight. 
My suit therms cut in. 

We reached the ripped wall and I 
gingerly pulled myself through it. I 
backed out, groping with my feet. 
My magnetos purred, seized. Boots 
clamped down to grip the ferrous 
strip running along the outside of 
the tube. I swiveled out and stood 
upright. 

I took a step. Click : magnetos 
clutched the metal. Hassat followed. 

The sack flared mushroom-like 
forty meters away. I could make out 
Gharma now. He made ritual hand 
passes. Their lips moved. Chanting. 
Their rocking rhythm cast shadows 
in the blades of light that cut shafts 
down into the cloudy fluid. Beyond, 
along the axis, the milky bulk of 
the retaining wall. 

We stepped carefully forward. It 
was like walking along the top of a 
vast cannon barrel toward a bag of 
blue light. 

“Look for the power plug,” I 
called. 

Step. Step. 

“There.” Hassat knelt on the 
curved organiform. The color-coded 
cap swung out. I unreeled the cord 
for my suit power. He plugged it 
in. 

I snapped it into the butt of the 
fan laser in my tool belt. It was in- 
tended for broad area heating, 
operating in air. I had no idea what 

120 



it would do in a liquid. 

“Try your hand gun,” I said. 

Hassat fired. A ten-centimeter 
bolt leaped out. Steam burst white 
in its path. 

“Not much range,” he panted. 

I cradled the fan laser. “This one 
may — ’ ’ 

A dull thunderclap. 

I jerked my head up. Beyond the 
sack a yellow ball glowed for an in- 
stant. It guttered out. 

“Shit,” I said. “They’ve blown 
a hole in the retainer.” . 

A tide brushed at me. Growing 
stronger. 

We both stood shock still. Debris 
from the explosion caught the blue 
light and then swooped back toward 
its center, sucked in. 

“Captain!” the tinny voice rang. 
“Massive incursion in the retaining 
wall. Bridge is flooding.” 

Gharma was going to drown the 
whole ship. 

“Try to deflect the stuff,” I said 
numbly. “Stack furniture. Run it 
down the nearest ramp.” 

“Sir, at this rate — ” 

“I know. Look, send some more 
men after us. We can’t do much by 
ourselves.” 

But I knew that by the time help 
arrived the fluid would have caused 
vast damage inside Farriken. We 
were far from any star. Im- 
mobilized, we would never reach a 
port. 

Something bumped against me. It 
was a ribbed drum, probably un- 
moored by the first explosion. I 
watched it accelerate toward the 
gaping hole in the silvery retaining 
wall. 

“Sir, we’ve got to — I can’t — ” 

I shook myself into alertness. 

GALAXY 




Hassat was wobbling, one foot free. 
I suddenly realized that the current 
was pushing me forward. 

“Don’t try to walk,” I called. 

“But we have to — ” 

“Duck!” 

Another drum swooped toward 
us. It slammed into the tube wall, 
sending muffled vibrations up 
through my boots. When I looked 
up it was vanishing into the jagged 
hole in the retainer. 

I braced against the surging cur- 
rents. My arm stung and throbbed. I 
hunched down to present less drag 
against the stream. My boot broke 
free. I slapped it down again, rock- 
ing, pulling on the power line for 
support. 

Wan light. Murky motions. 

What had been the Master’s plan? 
To kill us all? Gharma’s sword 
lifted high, coming down with ritual 
grace on the necks of the Lengen 
priests. Chopping. But how were 
the rest of us to die? Or . 

Floating. Warm and lazy. 

The waxy light . 

The voices murmured. Tongues 
speaking without form, of days be- 
fore we became encased in words 
. cutting across the filmy 
bonds the Master had laced around 
my bicameral mind, lefthandright 
brain, ancient . 

But the voices faded . 

My head buzzed. A fine weak- 
ness washed over me.. It would be 
so fine to fly in this swift breeze, to 
spread wings and loft through it. To 
skim by good Gharma and his 
madman chant, consider the waters 
in their ways, yes, give a last wave 
and zoom past, singing my own 
private song. Then a last gyre, 
banking and swooping. The tinkling 

THE STARS IN SHROUD 



rapids would laugh with me. Sing 
the war galactic, Ling. Strut a time 
on this final stage. Comes the high 
dive. White foam. Zip, and you’re 
through. Back on the bridge, Cap- 
tain of a Starship all spattered with 
gold. Epaulettes for all. 

Let me go. 

Let — 

A boot slipped. 

I twisted to bring it back. 

The other click broke free. 

I reeled out the power line. 
Gauze clouded my helmet. Air 
rasped raw in my throat. 

Battering, battering, the current 
swept me down. 

All these years riding the high 
vacuum . never thought ... it 
would come by drowning . 

My right hand twitched. The fan 
laser blazed. A beam orange-hot 
shot out in front of me. Steam jack- 
eted it. Cotton streamers belched 
back toward me. I felt it punch me 
in the gut. 

Turning — 

Flying — 

I rolled my eyes up, searching for 
the blue mushroom. Heels looping 
over — 

I arced the laser beam around, 
letting the steam jet play against 
me. It buzzed in the cold, watery 
hand that clasped me. 

Punched me. 

Again. 

The sack loomed. I thrashed 
uselessly. Fire the orange plume. 
Wait. Fire agin. Fire — 

I thudded against the fat blue bal- 
loon. I released the laser, it was still 
clipped to my belt. I snatched at the 
folds of the sacking. 

Got a grip. Swung down. 

Boots clapped to metal. I leaned 

121 




against the billowing sack, taking 
shelter from the current. 

I peered in. A blue lagoon. 

Gharma’s head jerked around. 
Eyes widened. He started scram- 
bling over toward me, calling to the 
others, mouth awry. 

The idea hung before me, glim- 
mering. 

I thumbed the fan laser up to 
peak power. 

Gharma saw my hand move. He 
snatched at his robes, trying to drag 
a pistol out. 

I braced myself and pointed the 
fan laser at the bottom of the sack. 
Inside, priests scrambled over the 
vaults. One knocked over a blue arc 
lamp. It smashed into a vault and 
winked out. 

The orange line leaped out. I 
fanned it across the base of the 
sack. The organiform crinkled, 
turned brown, then black. I felt a 
flash of hot pain in my left arm. I 
looked up. Gharma’s laser was cut- 
ting away at my suit. Metal beaded 
and sputtered away into the waters. 

But — 

Directly in front of Gharma, 
where his beam lanced, the sack 
blackened. Broke. The fluid 
smashed into him, driving him 
against the far side of the sack. 

I chopped at the base. It gave. 
The sack lifted under the fractional 
tug of centrifugal gravity. It rippled. 
Inside, priests tumbled in panic. 
The Hour of Last Things was com- 
ing a bit early. 

The sack wilted. The current 
caught it. Bubbles belched out, 
rose. 

It began to drift. The sucking 
hole in the retaining wall dragged it 
down. Inside, faces: mouths 



stretched open, hands clenched, 
eyes frantic. 

It struck. The vaults jammed in 
the hole. 

Soundless, the sacking folded 
over them. Air dribbled away. 

The sacking clogged the hole 
Flow ebbed and stopped. The plug 
settled into place. 

So many. Majumbdahr, the Mas- 
ter, now Gharma. And so many 
more. Sleep’s dark and silent 
gate ...

The bridge was a foul mess. The 
colloidal fluid reeked of oil. It slop- 
ped at our ankles. Hassat — who had 
hung on to a strut the whole time, 
and lived — organized a team to 
flush out the ship. 

K, J and I decks were sub- 
merged. Multiple subsystem failure. 
Two crewmen dead. My console 
half red and winking. Everywhere, 
equipment dripped. 

I thumbed my readout screen to 
activity. Where would we go? 

A home away from Rome, that’s 
what we needed. Far from Fleet. A 
comfortable G-star with room to let. 
Amid Farriken ' s dry catalog of 
facts and numbers there was surely 
a clue. The galaxy was open. We 
had fuel, reaction mass. We would 
explore. 

The message to Veden had gone 
out moments before. Now my 
energy seeped away and amid the 
lapping waters I lounged, watching 
the cleanup crew with sandy eyes. 

Time for another message. Yes. 

I switched through Comm. “Fleet 
Central, urgent.” I blinked, 
squinted, rummaged for words.

GALAXY 




“This is Ling Sanjen, late of 
Fleet. I’m serving notice on you, 
and on your damned Empire. Do 
what you can about the Quarn. 
Then forget this war. The Quarn 
will vanish anyway. They’re busy 
cutting their throats right now.” 

A crewman splashed by. Lapping 
waters . The sound no longer 
had power over me. Music, I re- 
membered, reached into both the 
limbic brain and the neocortex. It 
triggered the emotions in one, the 
analytic of order in the other. 
Mathematics could do that, 
too . delicately touch the lim- 
bic .. music sliding into num- 
ber . 

I shook my head. We were no 
simple assembly of “the seat of rea- 
son”, “the seat of emotion”, tin- 
kertoy parts. A man was more than 
a mere man could know. 

I grimaced, feeling things shifting 
inside my mind. Whatever fine- 
grained work the Master had done on 
me, done on us all, was coming 
apart, leftbrainrightbrain all scram- 
bled now, returning to our own 
human equilibrium. 

“Look,” I said, “what we never 
understood about the Quarn was 
that this war was a last task for 
them. They had to wipe us from the 
slate because we were their worst 
failure. A symbol of their decline. 
If you go out to the halo stars I 
think you’ll find their works, their 
art, their libraries, all carefully pre- 
served. All the things they wanted 
to be remembered by. Libraries — 
not us. They never understood us. 
And they • were so sure they 
did ...” 

I coughed. My throat rasped. 
“Listen, Fleet. If you’re smart 



some of you will survive. And if 
you do my granchildren may run 
into you sometime. Watch out if 
they do, though — you won’t under- 
stand them. They’re going to be 
like me.” 

I clicked off. I chuckled, imagin- 
ing what Tonji would think when he 
heard that. Ling the madman, yes. 
Maybe someday I’d be rheumatic 
and respectable, but not now. 

I’d gotten married to Fleet and 
Angela about the same time. Now I 
was divorced from one, but the easy 
analogy told a lie; Angela was a 
person, not an idea. 

Rhandra splashed over to my 
couch. “I’ll help you back to our 
room.” Her face, lined with care, 
seemed much older now. Yet the 
light still glimmered in those eyes. 
And there were rich years for both 
of us. For all of us. 

“No.” 

“You must rest. Your arm — ” 

“No. I’ve got one more thing to 
do.” 



★ ★ ★ 

Things happen, that’s all. 

I made the way down alone. Oily 
puddles glimmered in the dim light. 

She answered the second knock. 

I went in and sank down into a 
deck chair. From the next cabin 
came the scuffle and chatter of 
Chaik and Romana. 

I put my face in my hands and 
pulled the sagging flesh down, up, 
rubbing my eyes. 

I raised my head. 

She looked at me expectantly. 

“Angela,” I said. “Let’s try to 
talk again.” ★ 



THE STARS IN SHROUD

What more can we say? Here’s Waldo! 



INVOLUTION NEVER STOPS. It’s a 
continuing process, going on today. 
Many people find this hard to be- 
lieve and point out that strength, 
intelligence, speed, and courage 
now seem entirely useless. That 
may be true — one of the depressing 
things about evolution is that you 
can’t be sure which elements domi- 
nate the selection process, here and 
now. And if you did know, there is 
absolutely nothing that you could do 
with the knowledge; either you have 
the right properties for genetic 
selection or you don’t. 

The thing that prompted this train 
of thought was a visit, a few min- 
utes ago, from my business partner, 
Waldo. He was wallowing in new- 
found affluence, wearing expensive 
clothes and sporting — most un- 
characteristically — a glamorous fe- 
male on each arm. He looked 
over the deal I’d found, promised 
me in lordly tones that he would 
think about it, and swept out. I 
have this feeling that Waldo, 
against all logic, is being favored 
by evolution; for, as any dinosaur 
will tell you, evolution does make 
mistakes. 

Waldo’s ride to fame and fortune 
got off to a very shaky start. He 
had been arrested, lumbering around 
the outer perimeter of Chryse City 
late one night. He was painted 
black all over and his attire con- 
sisted of dark blue briefs, an oxy- 

THE DALMATIAN OF FAUST 



gen hose and mask, and a pair of 
thermal slippers. His general appear- 
ance made such a deep impression 
on the guard who spotted him that 
the alert for a Level Five 
emergency — Alien Attack — had been 
given. Within minutes Waldo had 
been whisked off to the office of 
Armando Faust, Governor of 
Chryse City. 

The fact that he was being treated 
as a lunatic, once it became clear 
that he was not an alien, annoyed 
Waldo. He was not insane, he in- 
sisted. Far from it. He was merely 
carrying out one of the prescribed 
procedures of Doctor Striker's diet 
plan. That plan had cost him a 
thousand Mars-dollars. He pulled a 
thin booklet from his briefs and 
waved it triumphantly at Faust. 

Faust was rumpled, bleary-eyed 
and unshaven, and he was dressed 
in a combination of a red-and- 
orange-striped sleep-suit and 
fireboots. His videocasts contrived 
an impression of a massive deep- 
voiced man, but that was clever 
staging. The voice was genuine, but 
Faust was short and dumpy. 

“Thermodynamic Dieting, by 
Doctor Janus Straker,” he read. 
“You paid a thousand dollars for 
this? What’s the deal?” He drilled 
twin holes through Waldo’s soul 
with the darkest, hottest eyes Waldo 
had ever seen. That hadn’t come 
across on the video broadcasts. 



125 




“It’s worth every cent,” said 
Waldo. “It’s the first real break- 
through in dieting since the sugar 
substitutes. Guaranteed to work if 
properly followed.” 

Faust was more impressed than I 
would have been. Over the past ten 
years I’ve heard the story much too 
often. I really thought that Waldo 
had been cured of his dieting mania 
after the last fiasco — the “Bionic 
Diet — Just One Capsule Does It — 
Based On Fundamental Biological 
Principles.” The capsule, as Waldo 
found out much too late, contained 
live tapeworm eggs. But apparently 
hope springs eternal, and Waldo’s 
dream for the sylph-like figure of 
his youth continued. 

Faust moved his black cigar from 
one comer of his thin mouth to the 
other. “Are you telling me you 
have to dress up in that outfit, 
Burmeister, and run around the out- 
side of the Dome as part of your 
diet?” His voice was harsh and full 
of disbelief. It took a tough nut to 
get to be top dog in a place like 
Chiyse City, and Faust had the 
reputation of being a hard man to 
argue with. You looked forward to 
an interview with him in the same 
way as a round of “Twenty 
Questions” with Torquemada or a 
game of “Chicken” with Attila the 
Hun. 

“Of course. Look,” said Waldo 
with the awful zeal of the recent 
convert. “The food we eat is con- 
verted to energy inside us. Either 
we use up that energy, in exercise 
or some other way, or else it goes 
to produce fat. So there are just 
three ways to lose weight. Eat less 
food, exercise more, or lose the 
energy some other way. True?” 

126 



“Sounds plausible,” said Faust 
cautiously. He puffed on his cigar 
and the reeking smoke hung like a 
miasma in the room, defying the. 
city ventilation system. “But what’s 
this ‘Thermodynamic Dieting’ all 
about?” 

“It maximizes the other ways 
that the body can lose energy. For 
instance: eat all your food cold. 
Drink lots of iced water — it takes 
energy to heat it inside you up to 
body temperature. Take cold 
baths — you lose heat that way. 
Exercise in the coldest possible 
place — outside the Dome. Spray 
yourself black, too, because that’s 
the most efficient way of radiating 
heat. And wear as few clothes as 
possible, to maximize the heat loss 
from evaporation. It’s all in the 
book.” 

Faust looked at the booklet. “So 
you’ve been doing all the stuff it 
says in here?” 

Waldo looked a little guilty. 
“Well, nearly all. 1 must admit I’ve 
skimped on the ice-water enemas.” 

Faust, iron man that he was, 
shuddered. “But why, for God’s 
sake, in the middle of the night? 
It’s just your good luck that the 
guard didn’t shoot first and ask 
questions later.” 

“You lose heat more rapidly if 
you are radiating to a colder heat- 
sink,” said Waldo. “Not only 
that,” he went on, delivering the 
final, unanswerable point. “Do you 
think I’d be seen running around in 
this outfit in broad daylight?” 

Faust looked at Waldo’s balloon- 
ing form, black all over and cov- 
ered with goose pimples. He shook 
his head. “I don’t know. Some- 
body’s crazy here, and somebody 

GALAXY 




should be charged. I don’t know if 
it should be you or the quack who 
wrote this book.” 

“Doctor Straker is a well-known 
and widely respected physician, and 
a former President of the I.M.A. 
Of course,” Waldo added thought- 
fully, “that was before his break- 
down.” 

1 think this was the point where 
Faust realized that further discussion 
would not be productive. He made 
up his mind. 

“Burmeister, you made every 
official on Mars jump out of bed in 
the middle of the night. Including 
me. I could give you ten years in 
the superfluid plants, and everyone 
would applaud the decision. But 
I’m a kind man.” 

Waldo waited in horrified antici- 
pation. Faust’s favors were well- 
known. 

“You’ve got a valid interplane- 
tary passport, right? Okay. I want 
you to do a little job for me — and 
I’ll pay you well for it. Not only 
that, I’ll arrange for this whole 
thing tonight to be wiped off the 
books. There won’t be one word to 
say that you were the cause of a 
General Emergency.” 

Waldo waited in silence. The 
rabbit doesn’t discuss terms with the 
stoat. 

“Maybe you know,” continued 
Faust, “that we’ve been having a 
little problem recently with the 
Maintenance Services Union. Mike 
Maloney is set to try a new angle — a 
He shook his head admiringly. 
“There’s been no real trouble yet, 
just a few broken heads. But it’s 
going to get worse before we ham- 
mer out the contract, and I’ve tried 
to be ready for most things.” 

THE DALMATIAN OF FAUST 



He removed the cigar and 
coughed so violently that Waldo 
expected to be bombarded with 
fragments of lung tissue. 

“Last night,” he went on, “one 
of my inside men told me that 
Maloney is set to try a new angle — a 
personal one. He’s going to grab 
my son and put the pressure on me 
that way.” 

Waldo made suitable horrified 
noises. 

“Oh, I don’t think he’d do any- 
thing bad to him,” said Faust. “He 
knows I’d skin him alive if he did. 
But he thinks it’s a good way to 
keep me off balance. So, I’ve got to 
get Werther away from here. I de- 
cided to send him to see the family, 
back on Earth — he’s never been 
there. Problem is, he’s only ten and 
I’ve got to have somebody look 
after him on the way. I need some- 
body that Maloney’s bunch 
wouldn’t recognize. I’d been stuck 
on that — until you came along. Ten 
thousand dollars for Werther’ s safe 
passage to Earth, and no follow-up 
from tonight’s little episode. Are 
you on?” 

Waldo, despite his habit of rush- 
ing into dietary insanities, is natu- 
rally cautious. He revolved the situ- 
ation in his mind and it seemed 
very clear. A pleasant vacation trip 
to Earth and a handsome fee, versus 
ten years in the horrors of the 
superfluid factories — if he lived that 
long. He didn’t really like children, 
but that was a detail. He nodded. 

“When do we leave?” 

“Tonight. Tickets are ready at 
the spaceport. Every hour’s delay 
makes it harder to get away without 
Maloney knowing. Go and shower, 
grab your stuff, and be back here in 



127 




fifteen minutes. I’ll get Werther.” 

The child who was with Armando 
Faust when Waldo returned was ev- 
erything that Faust himself was not. 
Blue-eyed, fair-haired, sweet-faced, 
and cherubic. Waldo hoped for the 
sake of family harmony that 
Werther resembled his mother. He 
was carrying a hand computer, one 
of the billion-byte models, and he 
smiled shyly at Waldo. 

“This is Werther,” said Faust 
with the fatuous expression of the 
proud parent. “You’ll be seeing a 
lot of each other for the next 
month, so you need to get to know 
each other.” 

Waldo looked at Werther, still 
quietly playing his hand computer. 
“Pleased to meet you, my boy,” he 
said cordially. 

Werther completed his calculation 
and spoke for the first time. His 
voice was a clear, musical treble. 
“Estimating your height as 1.80 
meters and your age as thirty-four,” 
he said “I calculate that you are 
approximately forty kilos over- 
weight. Your life expectancy should 
therefore be reduced by 9.2 years, 
the probability that you will develop 
circulatory problems and flat feet is 
increased by 38%, and you should 
become totally impotent at the age 
of forty-nine.” 

Waldo was struck dumb. He 
looked at Armando Faust and 
waited for a thunderbolt of stem pa- 
rental discipline to descend on 
Werther’s head. Faust merely shook 
his head and smiled indulgently. 
“It’s wonderful, what he can do 
using that little computer. I tell you, 
he’ll be world famous in a few 
more years. 

“Now, Werther,” he went on. “I 

128 



hope you have everything ready.” 

Werther smiled like an angel. “I 
won’t go without Bismarck,” he 
said. 

Faust frowned. “Now, Werther, I 
told you he can’t go with you. Get 
ready, and you and Mr. Burmeister 
must be off.” 

Werther didn’t move. “I won’t 
go without Bismarck,” he repeated 
emphatically. 

Faust looked at Waldo and 
shrugged hopelessly. “It’s no 
good,” he said. “You heard him. 
He won’t go without Bismarck. 
You’ll have to look after both of 
them.” 

Once upon a time Waldo had 
had a good general education. He 
had a sudden vision of an interplan- 
etary flight from Mars to Earth, ac- 
companying Werther and the mum- 
mified corpse of the Iron Chancel- 
lor. Before he could ask for details, 
Werther had opened the inner door 
of the suite and called through it. 
“Bismarck! Come!” 

Waldo was both relieved and hor- 
rified when a large dog bounded in. 
It began at the front as a conven- 
tional cocker spaniel, but about the 
middle of the chest there was a 
dreadful swirl of miscegenation and 
the rear half, white with black 
spots, was a definite Dalmatian. 

Bismarck, unaware of his strange 
appearance, wagged a long, fluffy 
tail cheerfully. He ran to Waldo 
and sniffed with interest at his 
trouser legs. 

“He’s just learning your smell,” 
said Werther. “Once he’s got it, 
he’ll never forget it. No! Bad 
dog!” he added as Bismarck 
showed signs of labeling Waldo’s 
trouser leg in a more personal man- 

GALAXY 




ner. 

“Werther bred him himself,” 
said Faust proudly. “He picked the 
genetic patterns and gave them to 
Muttants, Limited, and they did the 
mutated cross. Bismarck’s bred for 
intelligence and tracking. Werther 
wants him to be a super- 
bloodhound.” 

Waldo was beginning to foresee 
problems. Escorting a docile ten- 
year-old from Chryse City to Earth 
was one thing. Escorting a child 
prodigy, clearly spoiled beyond 
all reason, along with his doubt- 
fully housebroken dog, was another. 
The sooner it was over with, the 
better. Waldo hadn’t eaten for 
many hours, and the foul tobacco- 
laden air was getting to him. He 
was suddenly very keen to get out- 
side Faust’s rooms and on the 
way. He stood up. 

“Remember,” said Faust. “Keep 
your eyes open for Maloney’s men. 
You won’t be really safe until 
you’re on the ship. Don’t share an 
airbus with anybody, and keep with 
a crowd of people whenever you can. 
You’ll get your fee when I hear that 
you’ve reached Earth.” 

He said his fond farewell to 
Werther. Waldo and Bismarck each 
received a casual nod, and they 
walked along the corridor that 
would take them to the elevator. 

It arrived empty. They entered, 
and Waldo spoke the level they 
wanted. As he did so, Bismarck 
growled. The elevator, confused by 
the twin inputs, did not move. Bis- 
marck growled again and Waldo 
looked at him in annoyance. 

“Can’t you keep him quiet, 
Werther?” he started to say when 
he noticed the white vapor .emerging

from the low ventilator grille. It 
dawned on him that Mike Maloney, 
head of the Maintenance Services 
Union, was responsible among other 
things for the Chryse City elevator 
system. But by then it was too late. 

★ ★ ★ 

In some places Waldo’s account 
of subsequent events fails to match 
other versions. He says his captors 
held him for three days without 
food, and undeniably he missed 
several meals. But I believe that 
was mainly his own fault — you can 
judge for yourself. 

He was knocked out by the nar- 
cogas for a couple of hours, at 
most. He awoke in a locked room, 
somewhere in Chryse City. It would 
be inappropriate to say that it was 
an unfamiliar room, since thanks to 
the unit construction methods used, 
every room looks the same as any 
other. However, he had no idea just 
where he was. 

The room contained only a bed, 
chair, table, and the usual sanitary 
facilities. There were two doors, 
both locked. Waldo rattled them a 
bit, more or less hopelessly, and 
was startled when he heard Wer- 
ther’s impatient voice behind one 
of them. 

“Burmeister, you’re awake at 
last,” it said. “Now we can all get 
out of here.” 

“How did you know it was me in 
here?” said Waldo in surprise, 
stooping to set his ear to the door. 

“Bismarck can smell you through 
the door. Look, this shouldn’t be 
too hard. There are lay out dia- 
grams of the city in every table 
drawer. You know, standard re- 



quirement for blow-out precautions. 
Get yours out and I’ll tell you what 
we do.” 

“But it’s no use — we don’t know 
where we are,” said Waldo. 

“True. But I’ve got my computer 
here with me. It’s like the Traveling 
Salesman problem, remember? I’ve 
got the program — ” 

Waldo straightened and turned 
quickly as the other door of his 
room was thrown open. Two men 
in the anonymous gray uniform of 
Maintenance Services stood there. 

“Thought so,” said the taller of 
the two. “We’ll have to separate 
them. I didn’t expect there’d be 
anybody else picked up with young 
Faust.” 

“We’d better be careful,” replied 
his companion. “Maloney ’ll skin us 
both if Faust Junior gets hurt. He’s 
the trump bargaining card.” 

“He is, but that doesn’t apply to 
Fatso here,” the tall man replied. 
He glared at Waldo. “We’d better 
get him to a different room, where 
they can’t talk to each other. Come 
on, you, quietly if you want to stay 
comfortable.” He lifted the electric 
prod he was carrying and pointed 
outside. 

Waldo turned quickly back to the 
locked door. “Don’t panic, now, 
Werther,” he said in rapid, high- 
pitched tones. “I’ll think of some- 
thing. I’ll get us out of here, just 
you relax. Oof!” he concluded, as 
the electric prod was applied briefly 
but effectively to the seat of his 
trousers. “All right, I’m going. 
You didn’t need to do that, you 
barbarian.” 

Waldo was shepherded out and 
locked in another room, out of ear- 
shot of Werther.

“Behave well,” said his captors, 
“and maybe we’ll bring you some- 
thing to eat later in the day. If 
you’re noisy, you’d better be ready 
to live off your fat.” 

They didn’t know it, but they had 
made a big mistake. Few things in 
life can rouse Waldo to heights of 
physical bravery and action, but 
threat of starvation is one of them. 
As he has occasionally remarked to 
me when in a philosophical mood — 
usually after a vast dinner, where he 
has demolished enough for three 
people — “hunger sharpens the 

brain.” 

The furnishings of the new room 
were identical with the old one. 
Waldo remembered Werther’s re- 
mark and went to the table drawer. 
A book of schematics there showed 
the main Chryse City life-support 
systems in all their monstrous com- 
plexity. Air, water, sanitation, and 
power were all drawn out in com- 
plete detail, showing the linkage of 
every apartment to the main lines 
and the feeder systems. 

Waldo reviewed the options — 
very limited ones. Power and water 
were delivered through narrow con- 
duits. The air-handling system, be- 
hind the wall ventilator, had a fifty- 
centimeter duct. To get through 
that, Waldo would need to be ex- 
truded, like toothpaste from a tube. 
That left the sewage system as the 
only alternative. It had a one-meter 
duct to begin with, but it merged to 
a bigger line underneath the apart- 
ments, and then varied in size again 
as it approached the central disposal 
system. 

Waldo, thanks to an unfortunate 
episode earlier in his career, was no 
stranger to sewage. Grimly he took 



the layout diagram and tried to plot 
the ways through the maze of pipes. 

There were two problems. Since 
he didn’t know where he was, any 
starting point for his analysis 
seemed equally valid; and since 
Maloney’s men might be anywhere, 
it wouldn’t do to simply escape — he 
would have to surface in a safe 
place, preferably very close to 
Faust’s private suite. 

He had to make some pretty wild 
guesses about where he was and 
where he would like to go. Then he 
settled down with notebook and 
pencil to a long session of route 
planning. There was inevitably a lot 
of trial and error involved. After 
five hours of grinding detail, draw- 
ing in paths and noting routes in 
terms of turns and numbers of 
ducts, and finally making a detailed 
list in his notebook of all the neces- 
sary information, Waldo had done 
all that he could. He made the final 
notation and put the book in his 
pocket. 

A square meal, brought by his 
captors at that moment, might have 
changed everything. But they 
seemed to have forgotten him and 
he resolved to move ahead with his 
plans. 

The toilet assembly lifted out, 
after a mighty struggle, and re- 
vealed a dark, deep drop to the duct 
below. Waldo carefully lowered the 
flashlight, provided in the table 
drawer for possible power failures, 
to the bottom of the hole. From the 
length of bed-sheet strip he had 
used, he estimated that it would be 
a drop of a meter or less if he low- 
ered himself at arm’s length. He 
began to insert himself into the 
hole, but it was a much tighter fit 



THE DALMATIAN OF FAUST 



131 




than it looked — Docotr Straker’s 
Thermodynamic Diet had done less 
for Waldo than he had hoped: He 
stood up, removed his jacket and 
squeezed himself again into the 
hole. After hanging for a second, he 
dropped to the duct, retaining his 
balance with difficulty, then care- 
fully retrieved the flashlight. 

The procedure from that point on 
was simple but tedious: follow the 
route listings and path designators 
that he had copied into the 
notebook, using the flashlight for il- 
lumination; get to the central sewer 
conduit and exit from there, using 
the main maintenance catwalks and 
entrances; locate the nearest video- 
phone, call Armando Faust, 
person-to-person, and tell him that 
Werther had been kidnapped; give 
as much information as possible on 
the place where he was being held 
prisoner; and then meet Faust and 
assist in the search for Werther. 

There was one slight problem. 
The information on the routes was 
all recorded in the notebook; the 
notebook was in Waldo’s jacket 
pocket; and Waldo’s jacket was still 
in the room, lying where Waldo had 
placed it after deciding that the sewer 
entrance would be a tight fit. Apart 
from that, everything was fine. 

Oh, yes, one other thing. The re- 
cent work of Maintenance Services 
had been well below par. The 
flashlight, when Waldo switched it 
on, gave forth the feeblest glimmer 
of exhausted batteries, like the mat- 
ing of tired glow-worms. 

Waldo stood in the slippery, slop- 
ing duct and looked at the lighted 
hole into the room above him. It 
was not more than a meter above 
his outstretched hands, and that 

132 



should have been no problem at all 
under two-fifths Earth gravity. Un- 
fortunately, the space was cramped, 
the footing treacherous, and Waldo 
had never been much of a one for 
leaping. After a few desperate and 
unsuccessful attempts, he felt that 
the lighted opening above him was 
as remote and inaccessible as Alpha 
Centauri. 

Since he could not go back, he 
had to press on, trusting to luck and 
memory alone to guide him suc- 
cessfully through the labyrinthine^ 
ways of the Chryse City sewage 
system. He set off bravely through 
the darkness, making his choice of 
turns and branches on a completely 
random basis. In terms of probabil- 
ity of success, he was like a solitary 
chimp deposited at a typewriter and 
told to write the works of Shake- 
speare. 

The dying flashlight was useless. 
After a few minutes Waldo threw it 
into the darkness and sent a stream 
of oaths after it. He ploughed on. 
Sometimes he would be in a tall, 
wide pipe that felt completely dry 
under foot. Sometimes he would be 
banging his head on the low ceiling 
of the duct and splashing ankle- 
deep in what he hoped was water. 
Where a choice existed, he tried to 
head ‘downhill,’ hoping to reach 
one of the central cloacas — all of 
them had maintenance lighting and 
access to the outside corridors. 

Waldo struggled gamely on, 
through verdurous glooms and 
winding mossy ways. As he said, 
the alternative to struggling on was 
not good; it was hardly a situation 
where one could choose to lie down 
and rest. One fact became increas- 
ingly clear sewers, at least modem 

GALAXY 




sewers, are not cold. The stereotype 
of a chill, clammy atmosphere 
doesn’t apply when people have 
ample energy for heating. Waldo 
says that the Chryse City sewers are 
rather like the medium setting of a 
sauna. After three or four hours of 
rambling he was on his last legs and 
felt as limp as a beached jellyfish. 

I know Waldo very well. We’ve 
been friends and partners since law 
school. So I believe him when he 
says that he had begun to despair of 
ever reaching any exit. He kept 
thinking of the limerick about the 
young man named Clyde who fell 
down a sewer and died. And when, 
at last, he came to an intersection 
and saw a faint light, far off to his 
left, he could hardly believe it. He 
staggered toward it, along a nar- 
rowing duct. He went down on 
hands and knees, then at full 
stretch, and moved forward. 

Waldo had reached one of the 
central settling-pond areas, into 
which many ducts deliver their con- 
tents. Unfortunately, he had found 
one that in its final stages was less 
than half a meter in diameter. He 
crawled on, finding the fit tighter 
and tighter, and finally, about three 
meters from the end, he stuck. No 
amount of pushing and straining 
would move him forward another 
millimeter. Nor, as he soon discov- 
ered, would it move him a millime- 
ter backward. 

He was stuck. He lay there, feel- 
ing that safety and comfort were 
just a few meters away. 

He was wrong, as it happens. 
The duct emerged almost ten meters 
above the surface of the settling- 
pond, and directly below the point 
of emergence was a sharp metal fil- 

THE DALMATIAN OF FAUST 



ter. If Waldo had been able to get 
to the end of the duct and drop 
from it, he would have been cut to 
ribbons. His problem was just a bit 
worse than he realized. 

As far as I can tell, Waldo was 
actually stuck in that pipe for at 
most eight hours. I don’t argue with 
him when he says that subjectively 
it seemed five or six days. After the 
first couple of hours, he became 
aware of a new factor. Something 
was pushing him firmly, and stead- 
ily, from behind; delicately, all over 
his nether regions. 

After a few puzzled minutes it 
dawned on him that he was ex- 
periencing the much-vaunted com- 
puterized sewer-maintenance sys- 
tem. When a blockage occurs in the 
Chryse City sewers, two things 
happen. The air pressure is steadily 
increased, in an attempt to blow the 
obstruction free, and after a 
threshold value is reached, the pres- 
ence of the blockage is reported on 
the central services’ control panel. 
To the control computer, Waldo 
was just another piece of waste 
material, an aggregate of garbage 
blocking a vital feed line. The pres- 
sure rose steadily. 

It continued to rise. Waldo, in 
the heat, sweated profusely. 

After long hours, the critical 
point was reached where tangential 
forces exceeded static friction. 
Waldo, like a well-greased bullet, 
was propelled suddenly along the 
duct with increasing speed and then 
fired out into space, over the 
settling-pond. He hung poised for a 
moment in mid-air, well clear of the 
metal filter, then dropped from the 
zenith like a falling star. 

He struck the settling-pond sur- 

133 




face flat. The resulting tsunami was 
enough to inundate the two service 
men arriving at that moment to in- 
vestigate the blockage. 

They dredged him out. The three 
of them staggered back to the ac- 
cess corridor. No one spoke, al- 
though there was a good deal of 
swearing, coughing, spluttering, and 
spitting. Just when Waldo was 
wondering how he could get loose 
of his companions and find a video- 
phone to call Faust, they came to 
a door off the main corridor and 
one of the maintenance men threw 
it open. 

“The boy was right,” he said 
through the open door. “That’s 
what the blockage was. Here he is, 
and you’re welcome to him.” 

They pushed Waldo through the 
door and departed for the showers. 
Sitting at a long table inside the 
room were Faust and Werther, with 
Bismarck lolling at their feet. Faust 
and Waldo looked at each other in 
disbelief. Finally, Bismarck stood 
up, walked over to Waldo and sniffed 
at him inquiringly. He recoiled 
slightly, then began to wag his tail, 
tentatively. He looked like an art 
critic, discerning the faint outline of 
an Old Master’s work beneath the 
more recent daubing of a lesser 
painter. 

“It is,” said Faust. “It really is 
Burmeister. You were right, 
Werther. No,” he added hastily as 
Waldo began to approach the table. 
“You sit down over there, by the 
door. I know you don’t like the 
cigar smoke.” 

Waldo collapsed into a chair. He 
had so many questions he didn’t 
know where to start. How had 
Werther got free? Why were the 

134 



Maintenance Services people acting 
friendly to Faust when they were 
locked in contract combat? How 
long was it since he had been cap- 
tured? He needed explanations, but 
most of all he needed rest. 

Werther’s childish treble intruded 
on his thoughts. “You should have 
left the escape to me,” he said re- 
provingly. “You are not in- 
tellectually equipped for such activ- 
ity. Also, you had no computer 
with you.” 

“Computer? What’s a computer 
got to do with it?” asked Waldo 
feebly. That crack about his in- 
tellectual capacity, like the earlier 
one about impotence, rankled. 

“Everything. Without a means of 
systematic calculation, the chance of 
finding your way through the City 
utilities’ system is almost zero. 
Even Bismarck and I had to make 
use of additional factors to arrive 
home at our suites. Do you realize 
that the 18,000 nodes of the utility 
system imply more than 10 66 
possible path choices on a trial- 
and-error basis?’ ’ 

Waldo didn’t know. Furthermore, 
he didn’t care. He closed his eyes 
wearily. He hadn’t gone through days 
of anguish, escaping through the sewer 
system, to be lectured by an under- 
age runt. Then a thought struck him 
and he opened his eyes again. 

“You mean you were in the sew- 
ers too? I never saw you.” 

“Of course we weren’t. What a 
revolting idea! We went through the 
air-handling system. I used the gen- 
eral schematic to set up the route 
choice as a non-linear programming 
problem.” 

Waldo closed his eyes again. 
This promised to be even worse. 

GALAXY 




“I set as the objective function 
the path length to the central air 
tunnel,” went on Werther, ‘‘where 
all the ducts merge. Then I mini- 
mized that, using a semi-heuristic 
algorithm that I developed last year 
for the Traveling Salesman prob- 
lem. It was far from trivial. My 
hand computer took almost three 
hours to compute an optimal 
strategy. When I had it, I removed 
the air grille and Bismarck and I set 
off.” 

Faust was shaking his head in 
admiration. ‘‘Can you beat that, 
Burmeister,” he said. “Figuring out 
the best path on his computer, out 
of ten-to-the-umpty choices. That 
isn’t the best part, either. Go on, 
Werther, tell him the rest.” 

Werther regarded his father 
sterolv. “I would appreciate it. 
Father, if you would refrain from in- 
terrupting me,” he said. 

Faust looked abashed. Waldo 
couldn’t understand how this man, 
who ate tough guys for breakfast, 
could be so subservient to a ten- 
year-old. It increased Waldo’s own 
distrust for small children — 
especially smart-ass ones. 

“At the point where all the ducts 
merged,” continued Werther, “I 
had to resort to a different strategy. 
When a problem is difficult, it is 
necessary to deploy all available re- 
sources. I led Bismarck to each of 
the main air branches feeding into 
the central tunnel, saying ‘Home’ 
to him at each one. At the four- 
teenth branch he began to wag his 
tail. As I had surmised, the charac- 
teristic aroma of Father’s cigars was 
strong enough to carry through to 
the central tunnel.” 

“Specially made for me in 

THE DALMATIAN OF FAUST 



Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,” said 
Faust. He held up his lighted cigar. 
“Each one wrapped from a single 
leaf of high-quality Scranton to- 
bacco.” 

Yes, thought Waldo, and hand- 
rolled against a steelworker’s thigh, 
from the smell of them. Fortunate- 
ly, he was too tired to speak. He 
was developing a grudging respect 
for Werther. TTie lad had a great fu- 
ture ahead of him, unless some pub- 
lic benefactor exterminated him 
along the way. 

“Father, I told you once,” said 
Werther in admonishing tones. 
“Please do not interrupt again. As I 
was saying, we took the main 
branch that Bismarck selected and 
followed the same procedure at each 
succeeding fork. Bismarck led us 
infallibly to the apartment, where I 
attracted Father’s attention and we 
were able to enter through the air 
grille.” 

Something still didn’t make sense 
to Waldo. “But how were you able 
to obtain assistance from the main- 
tenance people to get me out?” he 
said. “I thought they were your 
enemies.” 

“Werther took care of that, too,” 
said Faust. “You see, on the way 
back here. .” 

He subsided under a stem look 
from Werther. 

“To answer your question,” said 
the latter. “On the way to the cen- 
tral air tunnel we passed a number 
of other apartments and could both 
see and hear through their air grilles. 
In one of them we chanced to 
observe Mr. Maloney. He was with 
a lady, and they were engaging in 
certain activities that apparently ap- 
peal to adults. Since my computer 



135 




also has a recording mode, it oc- 
curred to me after a few minutes to 
make a video and sound recording 
through the mesh of the grille. It is 
not of any great quality, but quite 
adequate. 

“Now, you may explain the rest, 
Father,” he said graciously to Faust. 

“Well, the lady with Mike 

Maloney — and I don’t know why I 
use the word lady, considering 

some of the things she was 

doing — happens to be a special 
close friend of Jake Gregg, head of 
the Transport Union. Jake happens 
to be a pretty headstrong guy. So I 
called Mike, he came over here, 
and we played the tape. Then we 
had a really nice, friendly chat, and 
he signed the new contract we 

wanted, on the spot. Mike assured 
me that he is really a good friend of 
mine, and he apologized for what 
his men had done, kidnapping you 
and Werther. Strictly against his or- 
ders, he said. He called over there 
to have you released, and they told 
him you’d escaped into the sewer 
system. They were reporting a pres- 
sure rise there, too. Werther figured 
out what was happening in two sec- 
onds, and we came over here to 
pick you up.” 

“Don’t forget to tell him about 
the fee. Father,” said Werther. 

“Oh, yes. I said you had to get 
Werther to Earth to get your fee. 
That’s about one hundred million 
kilometers, so you only made it a 
billionth of the way. But Werther 
points out that the kidnapping set- 
tled the crisis, and he didn’t want to 
go to Earth anyway. So he told me 
to — I mean, I’m going to pay you 
half the fee, for your efforts. What 
do you think of that, Burmeister? 

136 



Burmeister? Damn it, Werther, I be- 
lieve he’s fallen asleep.” 

Indeed he had. While Faust had 
been speaking, Waldo had at last 
managed to remove several bits of 
twisted metal, broken ceramics and 
unrecognizable glop from inside his 
shirt and trousers. He had collected 
them during his visit to the 
settling-pond, and the discomfort 
they caused had been the only thing 
keeping him awake. He was aware 
of certain mammoth stirrings and 
churnings deep inside him as his 
stomach fought a great battle with 
his ingestions from the settling- 
pond, but even that couldn’t stop 
his eyes closing. Something at- 
tempted, something done, has 
earned the night’s repose, he 
thought. He slept. 

* * * 

It took Waldo a while to recover 
from his ordeal, including the case 
of dysentery he picked up somehow 
on his trip through the sewers. 
While he was recuperating, he had 
a constant stream of visitors. The 
whole episode, involving boy, dog, 
and man in their complex trips 
through the utility system of Chryse 
City, caught the public fancy. In 
particular, Waldo’s spectacular exit 
from the last duct attracted all the 
headlines. “Human cork survives 
tunnel ordeal,” said one; “Human 
cannonball makes ‘soft landing’ 
after death-defying flight,” pro- 
claimed another. Waldo was famous. 

It didn’t take the newsmen long 
to decide they would rather deal 
with Waldo than Werther, who 
treated them all like idiots and was 
enraged by any reporting errors. 

GALAXY 




Waldo lay there at his ease 
while his bank balance, already fat 
from Faust’s fee, swelled hourly as 
he conducted paid interviews with 
all forms of the media. He sold the 
book rights for a princely sum, and 
now there is talk of making a 
holo-movie based on the episode. 

Do you see what I mean about 
evolution? Waldo exhibited none of 
the usual survival traits. Oh, well, 
perhaps a certain blind persistence. 
But as usual, he landed on his feet. 
He always does. It convinces me 
that the main genetic selection 
criterion these days is not skill, in- 
telligence, or any of the usual vir- 
tues. It’s entertainment value. Have 
that, and everything else will come 
to you. 

Waldo has so much money now, 
he’s hesitating to go ahead with the 
deal I set up for him. By the time 



he recovered from his experience, 
the lack of food after he was kid- 
napped, his strenuous exercises in 
the Turkish-bath atmosphere of the 
sewer, plus the dysentery he de- 
veloped there, had all produced a 
big effect. I contacted Doctor 
Straker and made a suggestion. He 
was most enthusiastic. 

The paper I have here says, “In 
the ten-day period after I began 
Doctor Straker’s Thermodynamic 
Diet plan, I testify that I lost a total 
of eleven kilos in body mass. 
Signed, Waldo Burmeister.” 

It’s a perfectly true statement. All 
he has to do is sign it and we’ll 
both be considerably richer. He 
seems strangely reluctant. He hasn’t 
said so, but I suspect that he 
doesn’t want to have anything more 
to do with Thermodynamic Diet- 
ing. ★

Art for Archie’ s Sake 

Is science fiction serious litera- 
ture? Why do writers like Barry N. 
Malzberg and Norman Spinrad pro- 
voke such hostility from some read- 
ers? Why do some sf fans despise 
fantasy? What is the affinity be- 
tween sf and mystery fiction? What 
is the secret of the continuing popu- 
larity of such writers as Robert E. 
Howard and Edgar Rice Burroughs? 
What is the real appeal of films like 
Star Wars and Close Encounters? 

John G. Cawelti’s Adventure, 
Mystery and Romance: Formula 
Stories as Art and Popular Culture 
does not provide the answers to 
these questions, but I believe it does 
provide the best method for finding 
the answers — by providing the best 
method for studying sf, and other 
genre fiction, that I have ever read. 

Cawelti mentions sf only in pass- 



GALAXY 



ing. His principal interests are the 
mystery as exemplified by Chand- 
ler, Hammett, Christie, Sayers, 
and Spillane; the western of Owen 
Wister, Zane Grey, and John Ford; 
and the social melodrama from Dick- 
ens to Harold Robbins. The 
questions: What constitutes a for- 
mula? How does a formula evolve? 
What are its artistic potentialities 
and limitations? And what does it 
reflect of the culture that produced 
it? 

Of the latter he says, “Patterns 
of convention. .are usually quite 
specific to a particular culture and 
period and do not mean the same 
outside this specific context.” So 
the “Virtue Rewarded” plot, like 
most of genre literature, is lost to us 
as time changes. The swooning 
damsel-in-distress becomes the lusty 
heroine becomes the feminist hero. 
The socially responsible knight-in- 
shining-armor becomes equally re- 
sponsible cowboy becomes the mys- 
terious stranger becomes the outlaw 
defending the innocent settlers from 
the ruthless cattle barons. What 
have we lost in these transitions, 
and what have we gained? And 
what do they tell us of the periods 
that made them best-sellers? And 
what can we learn of our own cul- 
ture from our genre fiction? 

A formula is a pattern of conven- 
tional elements to be found in the 
majority of works of a particular 
kind. Usually the people who invent 
them, such as Poe or Doyle or 
Owen Wister or Dickens, do not re- 
alize they are inventing a whole 
new literature. As Cawelti points 
out, although Poe invented the de- 
tective story in the 1840’s, it was 
not until the ’90’s, with Conan 



Doyle, that the form became popu- 
lar. 

In science fiction it has taken 
decades for the formulas exem- 
plified in Star Wars and Close 
Encounters to enter the popular 
consciousness so as to become ac- 
ceptable to a wide audience. Why? 
Because a formula is grounded in the 
mysterious human psychology of 
patterns. Those who appreciate for- 
mula literature are those who have 
absorbed the elements of the pat- 
terns, and they come to each new 
work with specific expectations of 
how it will all come out; and as 
Robert Warshow says, “Originality 
is to be welcomed only in the de- 
gree that it intensifies the expected 
experience without fundamentally 
altering it.” 

I believe that statement answers 
virtually all of my initial questions. 
At least in part. 

But I can hear you shuddering 
out there. Sf? Formula literature? 

‘ ‘Walker, you — mundane!’ ’ 

Academic criticism of sf usually 
bothers me in one of two ways: 
either the critic is so intent on prov- 
ing the literary respectability of the 
genre that he will make exorbitant 
claims for its literary merits; or he 
is apologetic, if not contemptuous, 
of it. Cawelti avoids these postures 
by being both affectionate and ob- 
jective, and not by oversimplifying 
the difterences between genre and 
mainstream fiction. 

Nor is his definition, and treat- 
ment, of the formula mechanistic. 
Usually we think of formulas as 
rigid plot structures, and the people 
who write by them as hacks, crank- 
ing out the same book every time; 
but as Cawelti brilliantly demon- 



BOOKSHELF 



139 




strates, neither assumption is true. 
A formula is composed of elements 
of plot (hero, heroine, villain, ob- 
stacles, backgrounds, processes of 
solution, and solutions themselves) 
that may be combined in an infinite 
variety of ways and serve as vehi- 
cles for the most enlightened social 
thought as well as for the author’s 
private vision. 

We all know that the sf books we 
like have plots, and that plots have 
structures designed to achieve a cer- 
tain effect: an effect we have exper- 
ienced before and found pleasura- 
ble, and so we return to experience it 
again and again. But while the ef- 
fect may be the same, and the plot 
structures similar, we demand a 
new inventiveness each time from 
the writer. Always, no matter how 
many books he has written, we de- 
mand of his latest that same fresh- 
ness, excitement and originality we 
experienced from his first. And this 
is as true of a Poul Anderson as it 
is of a Harlan Ellison. 

Defined in the strictest sense, 
formula analysis may account for 
why series books have been so popu- 
lar, and why particular writers of 
no outstanding merit, such as Andre 
Norton, have been such favorites. 
On the other hand, defined more 
loosely, it helps to explain why less 
conventional stories and novels such 
as “Riders of the Purple Wage” or 
Stand on Zanzibar created so much 
excitement by combining new 
styles and ideas with conventional 
sf treatments. Where such a new 
combination is made so that it in- 
tensifies the sf experience, it is 
greeted with applause; where it de- 
intensifies the experience, usually by 
subordinating it to characterization 

140 



or thematic development, it is 
roundly booed. 

The principal problem in evaluat- 
ing sf has always been the matter of 
comparison between it and main- 
stream fiction. Is a formula fic- 
tion the equal of the non-formulaic? 

I would say no. Some would 
say yes. And we would go on ar- 
guing forever. But what Cawelti 
says is that the comparison is ir- 
relevant. People read sf, as other 
genre fiction, for different reasons 
than they read “serious” literature. 
And it is in their differences, in 
their own uniqueness, that sf, and 
other genre fiction, are best ap- 
preciated. 

Genre fiction is usually deni- 
grated for its limitations, and cer- 
tainly it has them; but the limita- 
tions of sf are rather like those im- 
posed on the robot story by the laws 
of robotics or on interstellar flight 
by the law of relativity. Once ac- 
cepted, they become an incentive to 
creativity as writers deal with their 
implications or try to find ways 
around them. 

Years ago Damon Knight told 
me that what he wanted his Orbit 
anthologies to do was to expand the 
boundaries of sf, to create “a ren- 
aissance in sf that would return it 
to its literary origins in Wells.” 
Others claimed the only way to do 
this was to destroy every vestige 
of pulp tradition. But did they? 

If one made the mistake, as I did, 
of taking the New Wavers too liter- 
ally, one was bound to believe that 
the whole movement meant disaster 
for the genre. And one was equally 
bound to breath a sigh of relief 
when the whole thing seemed to 
blow over in a few years. But what 

GALAXY 




really happened? Did the New 
Wave fail? 

By the mid- 1970’s, I realized 
sf had changed for the better; but 
how much of that change could be 
attributed to the New Wave I could 
not be sure. Now, thanks to Cawelti 
and his analysis of the evolution of 
other genres, I have a better idea. 

Revolution within a genre is a 
matter of new combinations of con- 
ventional elements, new styles, new 
languages, new ideas, and elements 
themselves. As crude as were the 
early experimental stylists, the New 
Wavers did open up sf to new 
stylistic approaches. They did help 
to improve the quality of sf prose 
and characterization. And most im- 
portantly, they opened the flood- 
gates of the 1960’s and let all the 
social turmoil of the age pour into 
the genre. 

Until then sf was dominated by 
the pro-technologists, the futurist 
optimists who saw utopia in a nu- 
clear reactor. They still do. But no 
longer does their viewpoint define 
the genre. The spectrum of opinion 
in sf reflects the culture around it 
more accurately today than it ever 
did before. 

But all of these things were done 
on the basis of what had been done 
before them by writers who were 
never New Wave, such as Clarke, 
with his quasi-religious alien en- 
counters; Heinlein, with his seem- 
ingly infinite inventiveness; and 
Philip K. Dick, among others. The 
New Wavers accelerated these 
changes, but did not invent them. 
What they did was to create a con- 
flict in sf that served to revi- 
talize the field by getting every- 
one excited about it.

My principal complaint against 
the New Wavers all along was that 
they were doing nothing more than 
imitating the mainstream, and the 
old mainstream at that — Joyce and 
Kafka. I did not appreciate how 
useful these techniques could be in 
revitalizing conventional themes and 
stories. In fact, they did not realize 
it either, for the prime beneficiaries 
of their innovations have been the 
more conventional writers such as 
Niven, Pohl, Zelazny, Le Guin, and 
Silverberg. 

Formulaic analysis, as presented 
by John G. Cawelti in his Adven- 
ture, Mystery and Romance, does, 
as I have said, provide the best 
method I have yet read for evaluat- 
ing the achievements of sf. But 
there is so much more to it. Cawelti 
is wonderful on Hammett and 
Chandler and Christie and even Irv- 
ing Wallace. His chapters on the 
crime story and the evolution of the 
social melodrama; his analysis of 
the Virginian — all marvelous. His 
language is clear of jargon, always 
lucid, always pleasant to read. I do 
not agree with all his speculations 
on how this or that genre reflects a 
particular period, but he is never 
dull. 

I put down the book each night 
slightly out of breath, my head 
swarming with ideas. I have yet to 
sort them out, but this much I can 
tell you: I have been reading genre 
fiction all my reading life and never 
felt I was wasting my time. But I 
have never been sure until reading 
this book what I was really getting 
out of it. Now I have a much bet- 
ter idea, and I feel more at peace 
with my enthusiasm than I ever did 
before.

An Edifice for Oedipus 

The first thing you will notice 
about the last two volumes of 
Tanith Lee’s Birthgrave trilogy is 
that the covers are ugly. One is 
somewhat better than the other, but 
only somewhat. Fanzine art. The 
second thing you will notice is that 
the title of the second volume, Vaz- 
kor, Son of Vazkor, is the silliest 
you have seen in years. (And Quest 
for the White Witch is not much bet- 
ter.) The third thing you will 
notice, if you read both books care- 
fully, is that you are going blind 
from the stingy fine print that is as 
uncomfortable to look at as to read. 

So far, so bad. 

The story is conventional sword 
and sorcery. The Birthgrave was the 
story of the White Witch. Vazkor, 
Son of Vazkor is the story of her 
son by the black magician (what’s 
his name?). She has left him with a 
barbarian tribe where he grows up 
thinking his mother to be the wife 
of the chief. He finds he has ex- 
traordinary powers, and these alien- 
ate him from the tribe and from 
himself. He also finds that the 
woman he thought to be his mother 
is not. He finds out his true iden- 
tity, but few of the details. He 
comes to hate his mother, and by 
the end of the first book, swears an 
oath to his father’s memory to find 
her and kill her. 

In Quest of the White Witch, he 
journeys south to the city of Bar- 
Ibithni where he establishes a repu- 
tation as a mighty sorcerer, which 
he is. He becomes involved in local 
politics; is beatified as a god by the 
lunatic fringe; and ends by leading a 
revolt against the throne in favor of 

GALAXY 




the outcast heir. The battle is con- 
cluded by a massacre of Vazkor’s 
worshipers by Vazkor himself, 
which will give you an idea of the 
sort of fellow he is. Also typical of 
him is that he falls in love with the 
new king’s mother. This leads to a 
charge of treason. But before he can 
be bodily thrown out of the city, the 
witch of the lunatics that Vazkor 
has betrayed sends a plague of flies 
to disrupt the king’s coronation that 
turns into a real plague that kills 
everyone, including Vazkor. 

Of course he rises from the 
dead. He goes farther south, having 
lost all interest in his quest for his 
mother. But events put him back On 
the track, and at last he finds her. 

For the most part, the story is 
good kinky fun, especially the end- 
ing which suggests that Oedipus did- 
n’t know when he had it good. 
There are some wonderful sequen- 
ces, such as the plague of flies or 
the meeting with the White Witch, 
and some fine writing; but overall 
the book is turgid and uneven. Al- 
though the story is supposed to be 
set on another planet, you find refer- 
ences to Greek myths; or a bar- 
barian saying to his lady, “Has my 
dulcet wife been scourging you as 
she begged to do?”; or purple 
passages such as: “TTie gate be- 
tween her thighs was golden as her 
hair, and the road beyond the gate 
was made for kings.” 

An even worse fault is her use of 
the first-person narrator. Despite the 
constant “I,” it is never clear who 
is thinking what. The story is of 
Vazkor’s maturation from a ruth- 
less barbarian with godlike powers 
to a sense of himself as a whole 
man. Ostensibly the story is being 



told by Vazkor after the fact. But 
this is rarely clear. The ruthless 
barbarian seems as sensitive and in- 
trospective as the sage, and his acts 
of brutishness contradictory to his 
character. Always the tone of his 
thinking and feeling is that of a 
well-educated contemporary man. 

Like Chelsea Quinn Yarbro in 
Hotel Transylvania, Lee uses 
psychology to revitalize the tradi- 
tional sword-and-sorcery formula. 
Vazkor is a complex character 
whose confrontation with his magi- 
cal powers is depicted as a problem 
of growing up. He loves his mother 
and kills his father at the beginning; 
then he finds his real mother had 
abandoned him, so he switches al- 
legiance to his father, Vazkor, and 
sets out to kill his mother, who, of 
course, is not the villainness she 
seems. In the end he switches al- 
legiance again: his father the villain, 
his mother the lover. 

The male-female situation in both 
books is as sexist as one expects to 
find in sword and sorcery: the 
women are, with few exceptions, 
either passive cattle or lusty and 
treacherous; the men are muscular 
and aggressive, or homosexual and 
decadent. (The racist elements are 
delicately avoided by a careful dis- 
tribution of skin colors.) But Lee’s 
real theme seems to me to be 
feminist, for the essence of Vaz- 
kor’s search seems to be to recon- 
cile the male and female principles 
within himself. 

Not long ago I wrote a glowing 
review of two short novels by 
Tanith Lee called Companions on 
the Road , in which I said I planned 
to read more of her and I suspected 
when I got done, I would like one

book just as much as all the rest. 
Obviously I was wrong. But it was 
not my jumping to conclusions that 
did me in. Lee seems to have fallen 
victim to that itch from which so 
many young writers suffer — she 
wanted to be a writer. And if that 
meant selling out her talent, she ap- 
pears to have been prepared to 
make the sacrifice. While the two 
novels in Companions on the Road 
showed care and sensitivity in their 
making, Vazkor, Son of Vazkor and 
Quest for the White Witch are 
hackwork. All the intelligence and 
ability that went into the former are 
present in the latter two, but laid on 
with a shovel. 

If Lee is anything like the writers 
I know, she is liable to say some- 
thing like, “Art, hell. 1 write to 
eat.” If there is any truth in the 
saying we are what we eat, she is 
in big trouble. 

Ghouls and Dalis 

When I was nine, a friend of 
mine, who was a year older, took 
me to see my first horror movie — 
The Mummy’s Ghost. It was Hal- 
lowe’en, and it was cold, and it was 
raining. There was a line of kids 
halfway round the block, and we 
had to wait an hour in the cold and 
the rain to get in. By then the pic- 
ture had started. We sat in the bal- 
cony, in the middle of a row packed 
with screaming kids, hardly able to 
move. Nevertheless, at the first ap- 
pearance of the monster, I managed 
to eject myself from the entire row 
and achieve the safety of the street 
in, oh, say ten seconds. 

A few years later it was I who 
was escorting my younger friends to 

144 



their first horror movies and howl- 
ing as much at their cries of fright 
as at the antics on the screen. 

Critic Elder Olsen has theorized 
that the essence of comedy is when 
a thing thought to be dangerous, or 
disturbing, is proved to be neither. 
Thus, the terrors of one generation 
become the toys of another. 

An object of terror is an object of 
fascination; and although we may 
lose our terror of it, we never forget 
it; and consequently, we never 
completely lose our fascination with 
it. But having lost our terror by 
overcoming it, we end with a sense 
of affection for the thing. What was 
once an object of dread becomes an 
object of delight, and even admira- 
tion. In the early Godzilla films, for 
instance, the monster was the 
enemy of humanity. But by the end 
of the series, he, and the other crea- 
tures, had become heroes, defend- 
ing humanity against extraterrestrial 
monsters. 

In one of the films a small 
Japanese boy learns courage and 
self-reliance by vicariously sharing 
a similar growing-up experience 
with Godzilla’s infant son. The 
Japanese boy was years younger 
than when I saw my first monster 
film, but already he, and his genera- 
tion, had formed attitudes toward 
them that my generation did not ac- 
quire until their teens. 

Satire and self-parody are two of 
the last stages of die decadence of a 
form. It means that people are no 
longer able to accept the form as 
anything but comedy. The sentimen- 
talization of a form is a kind of 
parody. The effect aimed for is not 
our original horror, but nostalgic de- 
light. 



GALAXY 




It was this delight that was the 
principal ingredient of Campbell’s 
Unknown, and it is clearly evident 
in the work of Edd Cartier. 

Along with Bok and Finlay, Car- 
tier is regarded as one of the best 
artists of the pulp era. He was bom 
Edward Daniel Cartier in North 
Bergen, New Jersey, on August 1, 
1914. An interest in flying led to an 
interest in pulp fiction and that led 
to a desire to become a commercial 
artist which led to being hired by 
Street and Smith during the 30’ s 
primarily as an illustrator for The 
Shadow, for which he did 800 
drawings between 1936 and 1949. 

From the late 30’ s he worked 
for John Campbell on Unknown and 
Astounding, a relationship that 
lasted until he quit the field in 1953 
for better-paying jobs. 

Cartier’s work was largely before 
my time, and it was not until I read 
his son, Dean Cartier’s book, Edd 
Cartier: The Known and the Un- 
known, that I became familiar with 
it. It is the first major collection of 
his work from Unknown and As- 
tounding in the late 30’s to his re- 
tirement, and it includes his draw- 
ings for the Gnome Press fantasy 
calendar, which are among his best. 

My first impression on paging 
through the book was that I was 
looking at the work of a student of 
Kelly Freas. The resemblance is 
remarkable. Freas is the better art- 
ist. but then, Cartier came a decade 
before his first appearance. 

Cartier’s work is a delight, but 
rather too light to be gulped down 
in one sitting. His monsters and 
grotesques are invariably ingenious 
and striking. His expressions and 
preternatural anatomy are brilliant. 



Much more so than those of his 
normal people, who are very bland 
except when they are grotesque. 

In fact, he never seems to have 
learned how to draw any normal- 
looking people convincingly, as if 
they did not interest him. His illus- 
trations for de Camp’s The Hand of 
Zei are pure comic book. Nor was 
he successful with serious themes, 
such as he did for Eric Frank Rus- 
sell’s “With a Blunt Instrument,” 
showing a great bone lying on a life- 
insurance policy with a pile of 
skulls in the background; or for Del 
Rey’s “The Years Draw Nigh,” 
which depicts an over-the-hill 
spaceman. Both are lifeless. 

He was best with whimsical crea- 
tures, animal and human. There is a 
childlike good-heartedness about 
them all; a mischievous twinkle in 
every eye. And his use of light and 
shade is impressive. In one case, 
for A.M. Phillips’ “The Mislaid 
Charm,” it is brilliant. An elf is 
stamping in rage. The figure seems 
to leap off the page. It was one of 
the few times that Cartier achieved 
any real suggestion of mobility in 
his work. 

As many times as I have paged 
through the book now, I am still 
amused by it. I think fantasy fans 
will find it a treasure, worth the fif- 
teen bucks. If you want a copy,

Things That Go "You” in The 
Nigh 

Because science fiction is re- 
garded as being as optimistic about 

145 



BOOKSHELF 




the future as mystery fiction is 
about the ultimate triumph of law 
and order, the paranoid science fic- 
tion story seems an anomaly in the 
genre. It assumes that the best man 
(or woman) will not win in the end; 
that the future may well belong to 
the strong and the ruthless, who will 
herd the meek like cattle. It presents 
a dark vision of the future which 
should be depressing, and unpopu- 
lar, but in fact some of the best sci- 
ence fiction, such as 1984 or Brave 
New World, is paranoid and popular 
all the same. 

There are numerous fine and en- 
tertaining examples of it in Dark 
Sins, Dark Dreams edited by Barry 
N. Malzberg and Bill Pronzini. The 
subtitle is “Crime in Science Fic- 
tion,” but with a few exceptions, 
the stories concern the individual’s 
plight in a totalitarian tomorrow. 

While on the surface it might 
seem that the paranoid story con- 
tradicts sfs traditional optimistic 
view of the future and reaffirmation 
of positive, or enlightened, values, 
this is not what happens. One of the 
essential differences between genre 
and mainstream literature is that the 
latter attempts to demonstrate the 
ambiguous nature of life, the 
“grays” of existence; while the 
former attempts to resolve them; to 
reduce existence to a matter of 
black and white. 

Sf writers do this not because 
they are ignorant of life’s am- 
biguities, but because the traditional 
plot demands resolution. Someone 
must win, someone lose. The hero 
(or heroine) may win physically, ut- 
terly vanquishing the villain; or he 
(or she) may lose physically, and 
still win a moral victory (i.e., the 



hero dies, or is destroyed, tragically 
for a principle.). But whichever 
resolution the writer chooses, it 
must be a decisive one. And even if 
it is pessimistic, it must affirm posi- 
tive values. 

Among the positive values it af- 
firms are that there is a distinct dif- 
ference between right and wrong or 
good and evil; the individual is sa- 
cred and invincible; power corrupts, 
and absolute power corrupts abso- 
lutely; technology is power, and 
therefore a demonic force for cor- 
ruption; freedom is available only to 
those special people with the in- 
tellect, imagination, and heroic 
courage to seek it in the wilderness. 

An example of these values can 
be found in one of the three original 
stories in this book, Chelsea Quinn 
Yarbro’s “The Generalissimo’s But- 
terfly.” It is an excellent story. The 
heroine is an intellectual who has 
supported a Latin American revolu- 
tion only to find its leader has be- 
trayed its ideals and imposed an 
even more oppressive regime on the 
people. She is reputed to have de- 
veloped a spying device in the form 
of a butterfly, from which no one 
will be safe. The device was unsuc- 
cessful, but the people believe in it 
and fear it. She is conspiring 
against the Generalissimo, and he 
intends to send her into exile. She 
goes, seemingly without hope, but 
undefeated. Her invincible indi- 
vidual will remains intact; and her 
values, by contrast to those 
exemplified by the Generalissimo, 
are affirmed. 

The image of the butterfly in the 
story could remind one of the flies 
in Sartre’s play about Electra. Im- 
ages of menace. Nature and 



146 



GALAXY 




technology illegitimately joined by 
the mind of man; a demonic hybrid, 
a symbol of sin and corruption. But 
a world not without hope. 

There may be no god in the 
paranoid universe, but there are in- 
numerable Christs. The heroine of 
the “The Generalissimo’s But- 
terfly,” and most of the heroes and 
heroines in most all of these stories, 
are as dogmatic as the villains they 
oppose, and always intent on laying 
down their lives to redeem man- 
kind. 

Donald Westlake’s “The Win- 
ner’ has such a hero. Again 
technology is the instrument of 
power. The hero is a prisoner in a 
prison without walls. He has a de- 
vice in his head which will inflict 
terrible pain if he wanders outside. 
Yet wander he does. Again and 
again, always getting a little closer 
to freedom. The villains watch 
him with amusement and then with 
fear. In the end there seems no 
possibility he will ever escape, but 
he will go on trying. 

In Robert Silverberg’s “To See 
The Invisible Man,” a man con- 
victed of antisocial behavior is sen- 
tenced to “invisibility” for a year. 
No one will “see” him on penalty 
of suffering the same fate. It is an 
agonizing punishment for him, bril- 
liantly depicted. In the end he is 
freed. The cops buy him a beer and 
let him go. He walks down the 
street and meets another invisible 
man. The man pleads with him to 
speak. If he does, he will be sentenced 
to another five years of the ordeal. 
Nevertheless, he embraces the man. 

Algis Budrys’ “The Exe- 
cutioner,” one of the best sto- 
ries in the book, concerns a 



judge who is also an executioner. 
He is a familiar character in genre 
fiction, a decent man who firmly 
believes in the validity of a system 
that by degrees he learns is corrupt. 
By the end we have mainstream 
and genre fiction face to face, with 
the picture of a highly ambiguous 
world that is deeply disturbing; but 
whereas a mainstream novel would 
have left us confused and disturbed, 
Budrys resolves his situation with the 
judge shooting up his own court- 
room. Thoroughly melodramatic, 
and thoroughly satisfying under the 
circumstances. 

But my favorite story in the book 
is C.B. Gilford’s “Murder 2090,” 
which involves as hapless an anti- 
hero as any you will find. He lives 
in a 1984-like world in which crime 
is unknown. He learns of the possi- 
bility of “murder” and decides to 
commit one. His reasons are igno- 
ble; his method ingenious; his fate 
ironic. Strictly speaking, the plot 
contradicts what I have been saying. 
The hero loses but his fate in no 
way disturbs those in power. He is 
a fly they swat with effortless effi- 
ciency. Yet the effect of the story is 
amusing rather than disturbing. The 
hero gets what he deserves. Murder 
is wrong in any culture. And by 
showing us his appalling fate, our 
antitotalitarian values, by contrast, 
are affirmed. 

This is negative affirmation. The 
society, or individual, is shown in 
such a repulsive way that we can’t 
help but support its opposite. In the 
story, as in most of these stories, as 
in most sf stories, the individual in- 
volved is “gifted.” He is smarter 
and stronger than ordinary men. A 
bom leader. The masses, on the

other hand, are sheep. It is never a 
question of democracy leading us to 
a better society, but of the in- 
tellectual and moral quality of who- 
ever leads the masses. 

There are fifteen stories in Dark 
Sins, Dark Dreams, ranging from 
good to excellent. Malzberg and 
Pronzini have done an exceptional 
job of collecting and annotating 
them. Aside from the Yarbro story, 
the two other originals are Elizabeth 
A. Lynn’s “The Fire Man” and 
C.L. Grant’s “View, With a Dif- 
ference,” both interesting. This is 
worth buying. 

Helen Hoke’s Demons Within and 
Other Disturbing Tales is for a 
more specialized taste. Fourteen 
stories that I, personally, enjoyed 
enormously. Most, but not all, are 
of the supernatural. There are two 
sf stories, “The Small World of 
Lewis Stillman,” which is chilling 
and “The Margenes” by Miriam 
Allen DeFord, which I had read 
years ago and still remembered 
fondly. It is an alien-invasion story 
with the most hilarious ironic twist 
at the end. 

There is a marginal fantasy, 
“Mummy to the Rescue” by Angus 
Wilson, and a straight fantasy, 
“The Attic Express” by Alex 
Hamilton that is extraordinarily im- 
aginative. And of course “The 
Squaw,” by Bram Stoker, which is 
in a class by itself. 

The remainder of the stories are 
supernatural, and they range from 
the frightening, as in Margret Ir- 
win’s “The Book” and Ambrose 
Bierce’s “The Middle Toe of the 
Right Foot,” to the satirical, as in 
Robert Block’s “The Man Who 
Collected Poe,” to the moving as in 

148 



“George and Alice and Isabel” or 
Jean Rhys’ “I used to Live Here 
Once” or the comical, as in Lawrie 
Wyman’s “The Phantom of the 
Screen.” 

“Mr. George” by August Derleth 
is a typical example of the premise 
that seems to lie behind most of 
these stories. An orphan girl is left 
with her aunt and uncle, who plan 
to murder her for her inheritance. 
Her kindly Uncle George has died, 
leaving her helpless. His ghost re- 
turns and does in the villains in 
their individual acts of attempted 
murder. In other words, a super- 
natural agency intervenes to punish 
them for their sins. 

In “The Book,” as in Bloch’s 
“The Man Who Collected Poe,” 
the sin is obsessiveness. The sinners 
become fascinated with the dark 
side of life; they cultivate their own 
irrationality; they cut themselves off 
from everyday human society; they 
become obsessed with their macabre 
interests and lose all sense of right 
and wrong. They are destroyed by 
their own obsessions. 

Most of these stories reflect that 
fear and fascination, attraction and 
revulsion, we have for the dark side 
of the soul. Their advantage over 
the paranoid story is that they are 
free to disturb us. They do not have 
to affirm positive values, although 
most of them do. They can leave us 
wondering about the nature of 
things, as happens in “George and 
Alice and Isabel” or “I Used to 
Live Here Once.” There is nothing 
primitive about it. To some extent 
we are all haunted by our past 
selves; frightened by our irrational- 
ity; uncertain of our substantiality. 
The safety factor in these stories is 

GALAXY 




that they all contain some sort of 
resolution, the villain is punished, 
or the truth of the mystery is dis- 
covered. We are never left in the 
dark. 

Demons Within was a delight. I 
recommend it. 

Another Day, Another Silverberg 

Triax, edited by Robert Silver- 
berg, contains three short novels by 
James Gunn, Keith Roberts, and 
Jack Vance. It is the first in a series 
of such books from Pinnacle, and if 
the first is any indication of the 
quality of those to follow, I would 
urge you not to miss any of them. 

First, because, as I have said be- 
fore, the name of Silverberg on any 
anthology is a guarantee of quality. 

Secondly, because this particular 
Triax contains one of the finest sf 
stories of the year, a technical tour 
de force by Keith Roberts called 
“Molly Zero,” about a young girl 
coming of age in a totalitarian state. 
The story itself, while absorbing 
enough, is less interesting than its 
technique. Roberts has used the 
second person singular to narrate a 
very tightly structured narrative that 
is compelling and powerful. A bril- 
liant job. 

Thirdly, because of Jack Vance’s 
“Freitzke’s Turn,” which though 
not as interesting as the Roberts 
story, is pure Vance in form and 
invention. A private detective is 
hired to recover some most unusual 
items which have been stolen by an 
old school friend of his, a singularly 
villianous and brilliant scoundrel 
named Faurence Dacre, who has a 
talent for revenge that would make 
the Godfather envious. The process 



of pursuit will remind some of A 
Coffin for Demitrios. Along the 
way, there are all the usual Vance 
trappings, although none are up to 
his best. The ending is predictable, 
but satisfactory. 

Finally, there is the James Gunn 
Story, “If I Forget Thee,” which in 
any other context would probably 
have been the best of the lot. As it 
is, in some ways it is superior to 
the other two. It has a marvelously 
imaginative opening sequence that 
runs on and on. Unfortunately, it is 
so interesting that when the story 
proper begins, it seems a letdown. 
Also, I thought the ending weak. 
But still it was worth reading. 

The cover by Randy Weidner of 
a celestial city emerging from the 
clouds is beautifully done.

Al l right, geis, where are they? 

“Where is who, Alter? If you’re

“I’ll be happy to cooperate 
w-with this column. Here, let me 
wash off those letters. ... A dash

You will read them to me, Geis. 
And you will read them straight. No 
interpolations, no snide remarks — 
that’s my job — and no censoring or 
faking. Is that understood? 

“Oh, yessir, sir.” 

Read the first letter. 

“The first letter is from Janet 
Lighthill Brown, of Las Vegas. She 
would like you to comment on sell- 
ing speculative fiction.” 

‘Speculative fiction’ is a name 
some science fiction and fantasy 
writers wanted to have adopted in 
place of ‘science fiction’ because 
they felt sf as it was known to the 
literateurs and the media was of ill 
repute. They were ashamed to be 
known as science fiction writers. 
Ugh, ick, pheuw. ‘Speculative fic- 
tion’ had a nice high-brow sound to 
it. Harlan Ellison was among the 
most ardent of these writers who 
wished for the change and for con- 
sequent respectability. However, the 
change didn’t catch on and lately, 
to the dismay of these snobs, sci- 
ence fiction, due to the superior fic- 
tion of such as Ursula K. Le Guin, 
Arthur C. Clarice, Frank Herbert, 
John Varley, Larry Niven & Jerry 
Poumelle, Greg Benford, and many 
others, ‘science fiction’ itself has 
become more and more gilt-edged 
and accepted as a legitimate fiction 
type. The academic world has also 
had a part in giving good old sci- 
ence fiction a higher place in the 
literary scheme of things. Mostly, 
though, the money success of the 
Tolkien books, Dune, Stranger in a 
Strange Land, and 2001: a Space 



Odyssey, Star Wars and Close En- 
counters of the Third Kind has 
raised sf in the eyes of most ev- 
eryone. 

“Alter ... if I may . she 
asked about selling speculative fic- 
tion.” 

What little ‘speculative fiction’ 
got published wasn’t very success- 
ful, since it tended to ape the failed 
styles and techniques of ‘modem 
literature.’ Avant-garde fiction, like 
Modem Art, has become an exclu- 
sive, in-groupish cult involving only 
a few thousand (or hundred, some- 
times) pretentious literary types, and 
the attempt by ‘speculative fiction’ 
writers to join that crowd failed. So 
at the present time there is no mar- 
ket for non-plot, anti-hero science- 
fictiony fiction. Nobody with 
money will pay for it. I hope that 
answers her question. 

“I hope so, too, Alter, but it will 
infuriate some writers.” 

High blood pressure is good for 
you. Read me the next letters, Geis. 

“Well, Janet has another ques- 
tion. She says, ‘Alter mentioned 
Writer’s Digest. I’ve heard of it of 
course, but I’ve never seen a copy 
and no one seems to know where or 
how to find one. There must be 
somewhere to subscribe.’ ” 

This is a dumb question, and I 
doubt that Las Vegas has no library 
which subscribes, or hasn’t, in its 
phone book, a listing for subscrip- 
tion agencies. I begin to wonder 
about Janet’s friends and relatives. 
Read on, Geis. 

“Alter, Ed Chambers writes: 
‘What is your views on religion? 
Are you atheist, agnostic, catholic, 
etc?’ ” 

A fair question. My species fol-

ALIEN VIEWPOINT 




lows the dogmas of Flerbyd wor- 
ship, which involves the sacrifice of 
newborn Flerbyds every suncycle, 
except when the blue sun occludes 
the pink sun exactly. Then we sac- 
rifice Zertposls and drink their 
rather tasty blood. 

I will say, though, that part of 
my crime (for which I was expulsed 
from our worlds) was religious in 
nature. I found it difficult to believe 
that a mashed new-born Flerbyd 
died for my gromps and would live 
forever in the interior of our pink 
sun. 

In short, I was an atheist in my 
system, on my home world, and noth- 
ing I’ve read of the religions on 
this planet Earth has led me to 
change my basic viewpoint concern- 
ing religion which I consider to be 
instinctual mechanisms for basic so- 
cial control of sentient creatures of 
a relatively low level. 

“That’s cynical, Alter.” 

Ah, Geis. When will you leam 
that your genes are clever little 
beasties who have structured you 
humans for the purpose of continu- 
ing themselves through eternity? 
Your human “need” for religions 
and rules and laws and morals is 
nothing but your superior genes 
making sure their carriers survive to 
breed and raise the next generation 
of gene hosts. 

*Gasp* “You mean we are ruled 
by our genes? That there is a Gene 
Conspiracy?” 

Certainly. It’s all so obvious. 
Read the next letter. 

“I will not! I’ve got to alert the 
world! We must rid ourselves of 
these parasites! We must stamp out 
our hidden, secret masters and be 
free!” 

152 



Geis — 

“I must be gene-free! How do I 
do it, Alter?” 

There is no way. Forget it. I 
shouldn’t have mentioned it. Read 
the next’ letter. 

“I can’t forget it! I feel . un- 
clean . used. I’m — I’m crawling 
with genes!” 

That’s the price you pay for life, 
Geis. You’re a beast of burden. No 
way to avoid it. Now, read the next 
letter! 

“Alright, but once this column is 
over I’ve got a lot of thinking to 
do. There must be a way. .” 

THE LETTER! 

“Oh . ummm. This one 
is from James Dean Schofield, and 
Jim writes: ‘Throwing books across 
the room, shocking! After reading 
“The Alien Viewpoint” in 
GALAXY, Vol. 39, #1, I was 
flabbergasted that one normally so 
efficient with his creative energies 
would so carelessly waste them. 

“ ‘Your point was well made, 
and using your examples I have dis- 
covered a quicker method of 
eliminating probable losers. Like all 
great ideas it is wonderful in its 
simplicity. Just set the unread book 
on the desk, open it and look at — 
don’t read — the first paragraph. If it 
is longer than say, oh 50 words, 
push the book off the desk and into 
the waiting trash can. Go back now 
and look at your appropriate exam- 
ples. Two of the good have first 
paragraphs of only one sentence and 
the third is completed in three short 
sentences.’ ” 

Ah, yes, Geis, the old short 
paragraph and short sentence test. 
Rarely misses. Want to test it now? 

GALAXY 




“It’s your column, Alter. I’m 
still itchy with my unwanted 
genes.” 

Okay, let’s grab a literary sf 
writer. How about Michael 
Bishop. Of the four novels of his on 
the shelves, A Little Knowledge, 
Beneath the Shattered Moons, And 
Strange at Ecbatan the Trees all 
start with paragraphs in excess of 
fifty words. And his other novel, 
Stolen Faces, has a short first para- 
graph, but a loo-ong second para- 
graph. Deep six this guy, eh, 
Schofield? Except A Little Knowl- 
edge is an interesting, if flawed, 
novel. 

No, I can’t accept such a test, 
purely on a mechanical basis, for 
reading or not reading a given 
book. There are writers who can 
write a fascinating, gripping, pow- 
erful novel in which there is only 
one paragraph — a 70,000 word un- 
broken paragraph. 

“Who, Alter? Name one!” 

Well ... I think Ubik by Philip 
K. Dick, if it had been a single, 
run-on paragraph, would still have 
made such a tremendous impression 
on me. I can’t think of any others 
off hand. 

“So what are you saying, Alter? 
That Jim Schofield is all wet?” 

Yes, I guess so. Put your brain in 
gear, Jim, when you look at those 
first paragraphs. You might be miss- 
ing something. 

“You might add, Alter, that 
some of the worst books start with 
short sentences . like Delany’s 
Dhalgren, for instance, and any 
number of hack novels written by 
hack writers who know two rules: 
short words, short sentences, short 
paragraphs, and keep-it-moving!”

Yeah ... a fight every fifteen 
pages — or a sex scene, depending 
on the audience — a handsome hero 
with a good, anglo-saxon name, and 
the forces of Good always win in 
the end just after it looks like 
they’ve lost it all for sure. 

“Formula.” 

Yes, formula. But don’t sneer at 
the formula, Geis. Writers have, 
writers are, and writers will make 
good livings from never, ever, de- 
viating from one simple, timeless 
formula they learned and used over 
and over. Timetested formulas 
satisfy something deep in the human 
psyche, and stroking the human 
psyche is a road to riches. 

“But, Alter — ” 

No, never fault the formula, 
Geis. Fault the unimaginative, 
dreary, casual, dull, clumsy use of 
the formula by bad writers. There 
is, unfortunately, no lack of bad 
writers. And by bad I mean the 
merely competent. They don’t have 
the knack, the talent, the flair. And 
too often those who do have a touch 
with words become spoiled brats 
and sink into solipsistic, self- 
conscious self-indulgences of style 
and technique. 

But — writers are not usually ra- 
tional people; they follow inner 
paths, inner rules. You should 
know that, Geis. Considering your 
talent and your compulsive misuse 
of it. 

“We are not here to do a 
psychiatric number on me, Alter.” 

Terrifies you, doesn’t it? I could 
lay bare your guts in one sentence, 
leaving you quivering, naked, a 
weeping hulk — 

“I have a letter here from — ” 

Geis is afraid of — 



“ — from Leonard L. Ballelli he 
asks why he either has to fork over 
eight to ten bucks for a hardcover sf 
book he wants to read, or wait 
months and months for a paperback 
edition to come out and sometimes 
a paperback edition doesn’t come 
out and he wants to know why this 
is. Answer the question, Alter. Do 
your JOB!” 

— failing, and he’s an infant who 
resents taking orders, and he’s a 
mass of conflicts and obsessions 
which cancel out often, and im- 
mobilize him. He makes uncon- 
scious bargains with God, is riddled 
with guilts, and punishes himself 
for evil thoughts and actions of in- 
fanthood and childhood and adoles- 
cence . 

“DAMN, YOU ALTER!” 

He is a complicated, neurotic, 
moderately talented man who has 
settled on being a big frog in a 
small puddle. 

“THAT’S MORE THAN ONE 
SENTENCE!” 

Tough titty, Geis. That answers 
the other question Jim Schofield 
asked and you tried to hide from 
me. Now about Leonard Ballelli’s 
problem. Huh. Life is unfair, there 
is rarely any justice in this world, 
and there is no solution to his com- 
plaint. 

“I’ll never forgive you for what 
you just did to me, Alter. Never.” 

Just being my usual unflinchingly 
dishonest alien self, Geis. Trying to 
make a buck. Entertain the readers. 
Now, if I’d really told them the 
truth about you. 

*Cringe* *Hate!* “Someday I’ll 
get you! I’ll tear your tendrils off! 
I’ll disembrellit you! I’ll fry your 
soul in soy sauce and — ”

Sure, sure. There’s another letter 
there to deal with, Geis. Read. 

*Choke* “It’s from . from 
Michael Nowak. He would love to 
see your opinion of the definitive 
wotk(s) and why they deserve the 
definitive label in the following 
categories: 

1. Religious theme treated in 
novel and short story 

2. First contact treated in novel 
and short story 

3. Space opera treated in novel 
and short story 

4. Sociological prediction 

5. Post-holocaust world 

6. Robots 

7. Pure “hard” fiction 

8. Pure fantasy. 

“Well, Alter? How do you an- 
swer? Speak! You asked for this 
sort of thing.” 

I don’t read and remember sf and 
fantasy by sub-category. And be- 
sides that, I haven’t read all the sf 
and fantasy published, nor will I 
ever do so. And furthermore, 
superior stories and novels often 
don’t lend themselves to easy cub- 
byholing by type. 

In short, I have no intention of 
even trying to answer or fulfill that 
list. It’s a dumb question. Don’t do 
it again, Mike. And even if I took 
the list seriously, I would have to 
say that the definitive work in each 
category has yet to be written. 

Any more letters, Geis? 

“One came in just this morning. 
From Alan Luck. Who asks if there 
ever will be published descriptions 
of a spaceman or spacewoman who 
is homy? And will a publisher ever 
print the descriptions of their adven- 
tures in as much graphic detail as 
they spend on ships’ interiors and 

ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



equipment and on descriptions of 
alien environments?” 

Yes, sometime or other a pub- 
lisher, perhaps a small-press pub- 
lisher, will publish sf and fantasy 
which does not soft-pedal the erotic 
and sexual side of people. But sex 
in fiction is difficult to handle. It 
tends to “take over” and distort 
pacing and emphasis and story. So 
what results is usually a sex novel 
with sf trappings, or sf with very 
brief, non-erotic recognitions that 
mankind is sexual on occasion. 

Too, sf has always been mostly a 
juvenile fiction, and editors and 
publishers were afraid to offend par- 
ents with graphic sexual bits and 
pieces, and often the young readers 
didn’t like “romantic mush” in 
their escapist entertainment. 

Sex has been avoided in sf, too, 
because it detracts from the sense- 
of- wonder elements. Who wants to 
read about a spacegirl and a 
spaceboy making out in the space 
station for ten pages, when they 
could be struggling against weird 
aliens or something really exciting. 

Erotic sf and fantasy will more 
likely be found in the men’s 
magazines where it’s okay for an 
alien to try sex with an Earth 
woman — or man. 

“Alter, we still live in an essen- 
tially puritan nation and world. 
Anti-sexual dogma lives on and on. 
Even the pornography of today is 
anti-erotic and concerned more with 
dominating and degrading women 
than portraying people enjoying 
lovemaking.” 

True, Geis. The unstated rule 
now is: look, read, think, hear 
about sexual acts, if you must, but 
it’s not nice to really enjoy sex. 

155 




“Here. .a short one by 
Michael Johnson asks: ‘Is the 

human mind capable of concep- 
tualizing a finely Alien thought? Or 
is it by definition impossible be- 
cause any human thoughts would be 
of an earthly origin?” 

That’s like asking if it’s possible 
for a turkey to give birth to a lion. 
No way. The human mind is the 
product of its heredity and environ- 
ment. It can only be what it is 
structured and programmed to be. 
That’s why, if you read a lot of his- 
tory, you’ll see the same basic 
government forms, the same basic 
social structures, the same basic 
conflicts repeated over and over. 
The same cycles of fashion, of 
morality, or the State vs. the Indi- 
vidual. 

“But Alter, the influence of sci- 
ence and technology — ” 

Has allowed the stage upon 
which these age-old, repetitive dra- 
mas unfold to be imcreasingly 
world- wide, of ever greater con- 
sequence to ever-more people. In 
short, the mistakes of the rulers and 
the ruled which used to be confined 
to a city state can now wipe out a 
world. That’s progress. Isn’t that 
wonderful? 

“You’re being sarcastic, Alter. 
Would you rather go back to out- 
door plumbing, no medicine worthy 
of the name, and no electricity?” 

No. .but that will come — in 
about five hundred years. 

“Science will save us. Alter! 
Mankind will soar to the stars on 
wings of steel. We will colonize the 
Sevagram. We will — ” 

Never get off the ground. Energy 
and labor will cost too much, and 
the priorities will be to the poor 

156 



downtrodden masses who must be 
fed and housed and amused because 
they vote and there are more of 
them than the space enthusiasts. Un- 
less a cheap power source comes 
along quick — like the long-awaited 
fusion technology that will generate 
a Golden- Age of riches, or some 
kind of efficient anti-gravity — the 
vaunted future of Mankind will be 
increasingly dirty, mean, and 
brutish. 

“Wow, Alter, are you ever the 
optimist!” 

True. A pessimist would be pre- 
dicting an atomic war within twenty 
years. 

“To get back to Michael Johnson, 
who must be sorry he asked his 
question by now, you’re saying 
humans can only think human be- 
cause of inherent structural 
limits — the brain is already think- 
ing its full range of thoughts — ” 

Yeah. And new information is 
limited to the brain’s ability to ab- 
sorb and utilize. That’s why science 
fiction writers have so much trouble 
portraying aliens — the aliens have to 
be comprehensible to the readers, 
thus the aliens must in some degree 
act and think and communicate like 
humans. Otherwise — no story that 
uses aliens except as totally incom- 
prehensible creatures. 

“What would happen if we hu- 
mans did come into contact with 
real alien aliens?” 

We’d probably try to understand 
their behavior in human referents. 
We’d give them human motives. 
We’d create a different, “under- 
standable” alien in our minds and 
try to deal with the real aliens using 
that model. We’d be fooled, “dou- 
ble-crossed” and etc. because the 



GALAXY 




“treacherous” creatures didn’t act 
like they “should”. Look how 
much trouble this country had with 
the “aliens” in Vietnam. Real 
aliens would be a wipeout. 
Xenophobia — probably strongly 

instinctual — would impell us to kill 
every alien that threatened us. A 
large group of aliens would send the 
entire human race into a terrified 
killing rage. 

“We manage to suffer your ex- 
istence pretty well, Alter.” 

Let’s not play games, Geis. I am 
an Alter-Ego who is clothed for sf 
fun’s sake in an alien cover. I am 
an aspect of your personality and 
character. .and you’re an oddball 
to begin with, by conventional stan- 
dards and norms. Hence we are 
here and not selling hardware at 
Sears. Do you have another ques- 
tion? 

“1 have a dozen questions and 
topics sent in by the readers, Alter. 
But we have no room to embark 
upon another at this point in the 
column.” 

Christ, are you getting pompous! 
Let me have that folder! *Grumph* 
*haw* *This is a good one. .* 
Here! Let’s print this one from 
Ronald E. Jackowski. 

“Agreed. Ronald writes: ‘Your 
column in the Dec/Jan 1978

another sip of the raw red wine, 
and resumed his discourse. 

— “The Quest for St. Aguin” 
by Anthony Boucher 

‘And how about this: 

A man in Des Moines kicked 
his wife when her back was 
turned. She was taken to the 
hospital, suffering from a broken 
coccyx. 

So was he. 

— “Rule Golden” by Damon 
Knight 

‘And here’s what is probably one 
of the most grabbing grabbers in all 
of science fiction and fantasy: 

Pa’s nose fell off at breakfast. 
It fell right into Ma’s coffee and 
displaced it. Prunella’s wheeze 
blew out the gut lamp. 

— “Tis the Season to Be 
Jelly” by Richard Matheson 



‘I hope you enjoyed these open- 
ings as much as I did. 

‘By the way, Geis and Alter, 
have you noticed that the first three 
letters of your names (G eis, AL 
ter) form the first three letters of 
GALAXY?’ ” 

Geis, is he putting us on? 

“Of course not. Alter. Except 
that to be significant, the first letters 
of our full names should be used. 
Thus: 7?/ chard E. GE is and ALtei 
EGo spell RIEGEALEG.” 

That has significance? 

“Of course, Alter! Spelled back- 
wards, it is GELAEGEIR, and if 
those letters are given a numerical 
value from an obscure numerology 



formula, it comes to a sum of 
$963,471,2005,008.67.” 

That has significance? 

“Of course, Alter! That is the 
sum total of the wealth of the entire 
Rockefeller family as of 10 PM, 
February 4th, 1978, and it proves 
beyond the shadow of a doubt that 
David Rockefeller is the Secret 
Master of the World and that in 
exactly 3,456 days the Saucer 
people will come from the sky and 
set up a utopian civilization in 
southwest Colorado, with Robert 
Anton Wilson as King (provided he 
has the time).” 

Dear Ghod, I’m inhabiting the 
brain of a madman! 

“All great Seers are thought 
mad, Alter.” 

You have flipped out. You have 
gone bonkers. 

“Just because I have revealed to 
the world my true, most secret, 
cherished convictions — ” 

I’ll have to disconnect you, Geis, 
and give your lobe a chance to heal. 

I only hope you’re well by the time 
we write this column again. 

“Alter! I am NOT crazy! I’m as 
sane as y — I’m as sane 
as. .um. .emm. .ummm. .well 
any sane person.” 

So long, Geis. Have a good rest. 

“Alter, you can’t disconnect me! 
I’m the prime Self! I’m the — ” 
*Glurk!* 

Sorry, J.J., and all you readers. 
Geis has been under a great strain 
lately. I’ll connect his lobe 
next time and we’ll see what a good 
rest has done for him. Thank you 
for your understanding. Keep send- 
ing in those cards and letters to:

How The 

Science Fiction Book Club Works: 

When your application for membership is accepted, 
you’ll receive your introductory package of four books 
for jusl 100 , plus shipping and handling. You may 
examine them in your home, and if no! completely 
satisfied, return them within ten days — membership 
will be cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we’ll send 
you the Club’s bulletin, Things to Come, describing 
the 2 coming Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped automatically. 

If you don’t want a Selection, or prefer an 
Alternate, or no book at all, jusl fill out the convenient 
form always provided, and return it to us by the date 
specified. 

We try to allow you at least ten days for making 
your decision. If you do not receive ihe form in time lo 
respond within 10 days, and receive an unwanted 
Selection, you may return it at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selections or 
Alternates during the coming year. You may resign any 
time thereafter, or remain a member as long as you 
wish. At least one of the two Selections each month is 
only $1.98 plus shipping and handling. Other extra- 
value Selections are slightly higher but always much 
less than Publishers’ Editions. Send no money. Fold 
ad, postage paid side out. Fasten and mail.
