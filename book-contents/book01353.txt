Hugos & Others 


I f yon’ve been paying attention to 
what we say up front here over 
the list few months, you don't need 
to have this issue explained to you. 
Bot well explain it anyway. ( Ac- 
tually, we kind of enjoy it.) 

Every year, at the World Science 
Fiction Convention, the assembled 
science-fiction fans vote to honor 
their favorite magazine, writers, art* 
ists and so on. The award is called 
a “Hugo” (after the late Hugo 
Gemsbgck, who started this whole 
business of science-fiction magazines 
some 43 years ago.) 

//, we are honored and pleased 
to say, has carried off the “best mag- 
azine” Hugo for the past three years 
running; and we are celebrating the 
most recent award with this special 
issue, containing stories and Olds By 
all the other Hugo winners: Roger 
Zelazny (who won the 1968 Hugo 
for Best Novel), Anne McCaffrey 
and Philip Jos6 Farmer (tied for 
Best Novella), Fritz Leiber (Best 


Novelette), Harlan Ellison (who ac- 
quired two Hugos this rime, Best 
Story and Best Dramatization), Jack 
Gaugjhan (Best Artist), Ted White 
(Best Fan Author), George H. Scith- 
ers (editor of the non-profestional 
magazine that won as Best Fan- 
zine), and George Barr (Best Fan 
Artist). 

It took a bit of doing to get all 
of these eminences to produce stories 
in a very short period of time . 
but, as you see, we did it Or they 
did it They all came through hand- 
somely, and we’re grateful to them 
— and to the traders whose votes 
gave us this honor. 

Now we’ve got to get busy and 
try to win it again. No magazine 
has ever won four straight. Maybe 
we won’t do it either . but we’re 
sure going to give it a try. 

T he Hugos, of course, which were 
awarded at the Baycon, held in 


5 



Berkeley, California over the Labor 
Day Weekend last year, were for 
stories and issues published in the 
year 1967. It’ll be some months yet 
before we know who won what for 
the material published in 1968. 

But meanwhile we have our own 
voting results to report, for the Gal- 
axy Awards, and that too is a source 
of considerable pride. 

As you’ll see by the announce- 
ment in this issue, the story that 
carried away the top prize was Clif- 
ford D. Simak's Goblin Reservation, 
published in our companion maga- 
zine, Galaxy, last summer. The is- 
sue was never in doubt; Goblin Res- 
ervation led by a wide margin on the 
first scattering of votes that came in 
on the first balloting, and held that 
lead in every batch all the way to 
the end; and we couldn’t be more 
pleased. For Simak is not only a 
first-rate writer for 1968, he’s been 
a first-rate writer for more years t han 
some of the competition have been 
alive. Not only that, but he manages 
to keep a steady production of sci- 
ence fiction coming along in the 
teeth of a demanding editorial Job 
with a leading Minneapolis daily. 
Congratulations, Oiff ! It couldn’t have 
happened to a nicer guy. 

The winner of the number two 
spot gives us nearly equal pleasure 
— in a sense, even more, because 
Larry Niven, as regular readers will 
remember, started out in If with his 
first published story, only a handful 
of years ago. His Slowboat Cargo 
(now available in book form from 
Ballantine under the title A Gift from 
Earth ) was as thoroughly in com- 
mand of the second spot as Goblin 


Reservation was of first among all 
the stories published in If Iasi yga r f 
something more than 70 of them, 
Slowboat Cargo easily led the way. 

Number three in the voting was 
also from If, and the Author Was 
that most productive of writers, Rob- 
ert Silverberg. The story was The 
Man in the Maze; and if third place 
doesn’t seem like anything to get ter-' 
ribly excited about, note Silverberg’s 
remarkable feat: Of the top 10 stor-i 
ies in the reader voting, Silverberg 
had written three — The Man in the 
Maze from If and Nightwings and 
Perris Way from Galaxy — which is 
exactly two more than anybody else 
managed to get on that select list. 

Fourth, fifth and sixth places were 
a virtual tie: Burt K. Filer’s The 
Time Trawlers (from Galaxy) man- 
aged to edge out the others by a 
narrow margin — an admirable shew- 
ing, considering that it was a short 
story and all those above it, and 
most of these immediately below, 
were either serials or long novelettes; 
Filer, of course, is also a former 
“// First.” Then came Rogue Star, 
by your editor in collaboration with 
Jack Williamson (disqualified from 
the cash awards on the grounds of 
nepotism — sorry. Jack!); and close 
behind was Piers Anthony’s Getting 
Through University . both of these 
last two from If. 

Thanks to those subscribers who 
helped us by sending in their ballots 
on request. It was a lot of fun — ■ 
so much so that we’re going to do it 
again next year, with more prizes, 
more ballots — and, we hope, even 
more good stories to honor!

I don’t trust her, right? And if Sue 
did turn me in, let me tell you,

I need love almost as much as

I’m telling you. You, the first hu-

HUGO WINNER 

Philip Jos6 Farmer, who was the Guest 
of Honor at the World Science Fiction 
convention this year, won the Hugo for 
his novella "Riders of the Purple Wage/ 4 
This Is Farmer's second Hugo; In 1953 
he was awarded the same trophy as 
the most promising new writer. Once 
again a science-fiction prophecy has be- 
come fact. 


The Quartermaster — let’s call him 
The Filamentous Wafter — had 
not been prowling that particular 
deck, hunting down ratio fixers, 
nobody would’ve known about it 
until it was too late. 

As it was, it still might be too 
late. 

The first I knew of the trouble 
was when the call came from The 
Bridge. Directly. 

"Hello, engine room MWST4I 
Hello, engine room MWST41” 

Five minutes earlier, the call 
would not have been able to get 
through. The electric sparks, mic- 
rowaves and hot mercury drops — 
spinning like tops — would have 
warped transmission. They were 
flying all over inside our ten f. But 
Subsahara Sue and I couldn’t real- 
ly be blamed for this interference. 
Although we would have been. 
Five hundred years had passed 
since we’d seen each other. Or, for 
that matter, any of the black gang. 
Although we both worked in the 
same continent, my territory was 
the Berber-Semitic area, and Sue’s 
was where the nickname indicated.

After managing to get permis- 
sion, toj have leave together, we’d 
signed lb fit I Libyan seaside ho- 
tel. We spent most of our tima on 
the beach, Inside our tent, which 
was made of a material to confine 
the more explosive byproducts of 
our lovemaking. During that half 
a millennium, we’d dormantized our 
attraction — notice I say attrac- 
tion, not love, if that’ll make you 
feel any better — but, even In dor- 
mancy, attraction accumulates a 
trickle charge and 500 years build 
up a hell of a lot of static. How- 
ever, there’s a large amount of re- 
sistance to overcome, and I’d been 
oscillating and Sue resonating for 
hours before our nodes touched. 

The tourists on the beach must 
have wondered where the thunder 
was coming from On that cloudless 
day. 

Afterwards, Sue and I lay quiet- 
ly to make sure that no one had 
been alarmed enough to Investi- 
gate our tent. We talked about per- 
sonal matters first, what We’d heal 
doing, our loneliness and so on . 
Then We talked shop. We chattered 
about philiac thrust phobiac weight 
efficiency ratios, toleration tare, 
grief drag, heliovalves and so on. 
We started to reminisce about crew- 
men 

Sue said, “Who’s in charge of 
cosmic bleedoff?” 

The Intercom bleeped. 

“Hello, engine room MWST4T 
Hello, engine room MWST4!” 

DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


Groaning, I turned on the inter- 
com, which looked just like a por- 
table TK for the Benefit of humps. 
The “head” and pari of the “shoul- 
ders” of The First Mate filled 
most of the screen, and the cam- 
era must have been several thou- 
sand miles away. Behind him was 
a small part of The Bridge and a 
piece of abyss-black shadow edged 
by a peculiar white light. The Cap- 
tain’s tail. 

That was all I cared to see of 
The Captain at any time. I’ll 
never forget having to look at a 
closeup of his “mouth” when he 
chewed me — not literally, thank 
the stars — in A.H. 45. I have to 
admit that I deserved that savag- 
ing. I was lucky not to get keel- 
hauled. 

Oh, how I goofed up the Ma- 
homet follow-up! The black gpgs 
all over The Ship had to sweat and 
slave, all leaves canceled, until 
proper thrust could be generated. 

The First Mate, seeing the mer- 
cury drip off me, roared, “Mecca 
Mike! What the bilge have you 
been doing? You oscillating at a 
time like this? You sleeping at the 
post again? You neglecting your 
duty again?” 

“Sir, I’m bn leave,” I said. “So 
I couldn’t he guilty of neglecting 
my duty. Besides, sir, I don’t know 
what you mean by again. I was 
never courtmartialed, sir, and...” 

“Silence I” he bellowed. Behind 
him, the tall of The Captain

twitched, and I started to oscillate 
negatively. 

“Why didn’t you answer the all- 
stations alarm?” x 

“It didn’t get through,” I said. 
I added, weakly, “There must have 
been too much static and stuff.” 

The First Mate saw Subsahara 
Sue behind me, where she was try- 
ing to hide. He yelled, “So there 
you are! Why didn’t you answer 
your phone?” 

“Sir, I left it in the hotel,” Sue 
said. “Since we’d be together, we 
decided we’d just take Mike’s 
phone, and — ” 

“No wonder neither of you has 
worked up out of the black gang! 
No more excuses, now! Listen, 
while I tell you loud and clear!” 





T he Rooster Rowdy was re- side a quasar galaxy, where she had

I was surprised when I heard of a new heliovalve. The Rooster 
The First Mate mention him. Like Rowdy was near enough to sense 
everybody else, I’d thought he was her, and he came galloping in, gal-

tors, since this valve was the mas- 
ter valve in a new setup Ententes 
to increase efficiency of bleedoff 
by 32.7%. And that really messed 
up our yelocity. 

Fortunately, The Quartermas- 
ter happened to be in the lower 
decks, where he was hunting ratio 
fixers. A ratio fixer, HI explain, is 
a creature that lives in the inter- 
stices between ratios. Thus, it’s 
compelled to be moving on, can’t 
stay in one place long, otherwise 
it’ll lose its foothold and fall. If it 
stands still very long, one of the 
quotients — analogous to a human 
foot — dwindles, and the other ex- 
pands. The ratio fixer, like any 
form of life, wants security, so it 
tries to fix ratios (freeze them)'. 
Its efforts to keep from falling 
messes up proportions and causes 
The Ship’s bulkheads and some- 
times even the hull to buckle. 

The Ship’s shape, size, and mass 
are in a constant state of flux, but 
generally controlled flux. And if 
these are changed without The 
Bridge finding out about them in 
time, the vectors of velocity, di- 
rection, et cetera are changed. 

Using human analogies, ratio 
fixers might be compared to the 
rats in a ship. Or, better, to bar- 
nacles on a hull. Or maybe to both. 

The quartermaster had caught 
one and was choking it with its 
filaments when it caught sight of 
the wrecked heliovalve and of The 
Rooster Rowdy chasing The Sexa- 

12 


pod through a hatchway into the 
depths. He notified The Bridgeaf 
once, and the all-stations akurtn 
went out. 


^Tow I understood why [The 
First Mate was talking Sweet- 
ly to me instead of the message 
being filtered down through suS- 
to-the-2nd-power officers and pe^ 
officers. With this emergency, it 
would take a long time for an order 
from The Captain to reach every 
engine room if it went through 
normal procedure. 

But I had not, of course, under- 
stood completely. Or at all. I just 
thought I did because I was too 
awed and stunned to be thinking 
properly. 

The Mate thundered, “In the 
name of The Port! You better not 
foul this one up! ” 

“I’ll do my best, sir, as always,” 
I said. Then, “Foul what one up, 
sir?” 

“Idiot! Nincompoop! I’m not 
speaking directly to you fust to 
give you a pep talk! A Thrust Po- 
tential has been detected in your 
engine room!” 

“A Thr - Thr - Thrust Po - 
Po-Potential! In this area? But . 

“Imbecile! Not in youf area, 
what is it, the Semitic?' But it’s 
your specialty! According to the 
message, it’s in the Southern Cali- 
fornia area, wherever that is!” 

“But what do I have to do with 
that, sir?” 


IF 



“Stoker, if we weren’t in such a 
mess and if The Thrust Potential 
wasn’t so promising, and if I didn’t 
have to contact 10,000 other prom- 
ising TP areas, I’d have you up 
here on The Bridge and flay you 
alive! You don’t ask questions 
while I’m talking! Remember that, 
stoker!” 

“Yes, sir,” I said, humbly in- 
deed. 

The First Mate then became 
very businesslike. Aside from a 
few numbskulls, coprolite - heads 
and other terms, he addressed me 
as one entrusted with a great task 
and with the abilities to carry it 
but. That is, if I had learned any- 
thing from experience. He did re- 
mind me that I had not only screw- 
ed up the Mahomet follow-up, I 
had blown the whole Ancient Egyp- 
tian Monotheist Deal. 

“I was called Ikhnaton Ike and 
Pharaoh Phil by my chief engin- 
eer for a long time afterwards.” 

The First Mate was, however, 
kind enough to say that I had 
shown much skill in the follow-up 
to the Burning Bush Business. 

Beware The First Mate when 
he’s kind. I said to myself, “What’s 
he working up to?” 

T found out too soon. It was 
the last thing I’d expected. It 
was a transfer to the Southern Cal- 
ifornia area and a promotion to en- 
gineer, first class. 

I was staggered. The chief en- 

DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


gineer of this room and several en- 
gineer’s mates and a number of 
very competent stokers operated in 
that area. In fact, there were more 
black gang members there than in 
any area of Earth. 

“The chief engineer’s had a 
breakdown,” The First Mate said, 
although he did not have to ex- 
plain anything. “He’s on his way 
to sickbay now. This report says 
there’s something about that area 
that generates psychic collapse. A 
distortion of psychomagnetic lines 
of force. However, as you know, or 
should know, you ignoramus, this 
kind of field also compensates by 
generating thrust - potential im- 
pulses. The Northeast section of 
this — what’s it called? — U.S.A. 
has a similar distortion. Both are 
danger ^reas for our engines. But, 
on the other hand, you don’t get 
anything good from a safe neutral 
area.” 

“Thanks for the elementary lec- 
ture,” I said inside my head, which 
was a safe, though not neutral, 
place for my retort. 

A few minutes later, I had fin- 
ished saying a sorrowful good-by 
to Sue and was checking out of the 
hotel. 

“Why should you be transferred 
to Beverly Hills, California?” Sue 
said. “It may be largely Jewish in 
population, but the citizens are 
basically English speakers. They 
don’t think Semitically, like your 
Arabs, Abyssinians and Israeli.” 


13 



“That’s not the only puzzling 
thing,” I said. “The Thrust Po- 
tential is non-Semitic. That is, it’s 
not even descended from Semitic 
speakers.” 

The engineers and stokers in 
that area must all have become 
somewhat unstable, too, otherwise 
they surely would have been used. 
So, the thinking of The Bridge was, 
let’s shoot in Mecca Mike. He’s 
fouled up, but he also had some 
great successes. Perhaps this time 
he’ll come through. He’s the best 
we have, anyway, The Dock pre- 
serve us! 

The First Mate told me that I 
had better come through. Or 
else. 

There would be officers watch- 
ing my work, but they wouldn’t 
interfere unless I was obviously 
mining an “engine” beyond re- 
pair. 

If I came through, if I devel- 
oped the badly needed Thrust Po- 
tential, I’d be promoted. Probably 
to chief engineer. 

The situation for The Ship was 
much worse than I’d guessed. 
Otherwise, they’d have let me take 
an airliner. But orders were to get 
me to California with utmost speed. 
I drove into the Libyan country- 
side during the daylight. At noon 
the saucer-shaped vehicle landed, 
picked me up and took off at 30 
G. If socked info its base fifty 
miles west of Phoenix, Arizona, 
with Air Force jets scrambling 

14 


from Luke Field. They neither saw 
the ship nor the base, of course, 
and I drove into Phoenix in what 
looked like a 1965 Buick, and took 
a plane into Los Angeles. 

Coming down over Los Angeles 
must have been disheartening to 
the other passengers. They saw the 
great greenish-gray tentacles, the 
exhaled poison, banging over the 
big complex. I had my special 
“glasses” on, and what I saw was 
encouraging, at least momentarily. 
Down there, in the blackness which 
is phobiac drag, were a dozen fair- 
ly large sparks and one huge spark. 
That big spark, I knew, must be 
in Beverly Hills. 

There, if all went well — it sel- 
dom does — was the potential to 
develop a thrust which, combined 
with the thrusts in existence and 
with those being developed on oth- 
er worlds, would hopefully cancel 
the drag caused by the wrecking 
of the bleedoff heliovalve. And so 
the vitally needed velocity would 
be ours. 

Can anything good come out of 
Ndzareth ? 

Can anything good be in Bever- 
ly Hills? 

History has answered the first 
question. The future would answer 
the second. 

II 

T told the taxi driver at the 
airport to take me to a street 

IF 



which angled south off of Wilshire 
between Doheny Drive and Bey- 
erly Drive. This was lined with 'dry- 
looking maples. The block where 
the taxi let me off was, in a sense, 
in the “dums” of Beverly Hills. 
Relatively speaking, of course. 
Both sides of the street in this 
block were occupied by apartment 
buildings, some only five years old 
and others about 35 to 25 years 
©Id. The apartments in the new 
buildings rented from $350 to 
$650 a month and so were consid- 
ered low-rent in Beverly Hills. The 
apartments in the old buildings 
averaged about $135 a month. 

My Thrust Potential, my TP, 
was in the second story of an older 
building. I had the cab park across 
the street from it, and I went in- 
side a newer, more expensive apart- 
ment building. This had a VACAN- 
CY, I BDRM,FURN., NO PETS, 
NO CHILDREN sign on the lawn. 
I put !3own three months , rent in 
cash, which upset Mrs. Klugel, the 
landlady. She had always dealt in 
checks. I signed the lease and then 
went back to the taxi. 

My apartment was second-story 
and fronting the street. It was al- 
most directly across the street from 
my TP and almost as high as her 
apartment. I carried my three bags 
up to it. One was full of clothes, 
the second full of money, and the 
third crammed with my equipment. 
Mrs. Klugel stood in the vestibule. 
She was a i heavy short woman 

DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


about 65 with ©range-9yed hair, g 
hose like a cucumber and a clowns 
mouth. Her black - rimmed eyes 
widened as I went lighter up Hm 
staircase with a huge bag in cadi 
hand and one under my arm. 

“So you’re a strong man in seme 
act already?” she said. 

I replied that I was not a strong 
man, professionally, that is. I was 
a writer who intended to write $ 
novel about Hollywood. 

“So why don’t you live in Holly- 
wood?” 

“By Hollywood, I mean this 
whole area around here,” I said, 
sweeping my hand around. 

She was such a lonely old lady, 
she was difficult to get rid of. I 
said I had work to do, and I would 
talk to her later. As soon as she 
shut the door, I readjusted the an- 
tigrav belt around my waist under 
my shirt. My two thousand pounds 
of dense metal-shot protein would 
have buckled the floor if I hadn’t 
had the belt operating. Then I 
took out my equipment and set it 
up. 

I was nervous; quicksilver bead- 
ed from me and fell onto the fleer. 
I made a mental note to clean up 
the stuff before I left the apart- 
ment. Mrs. Klugel looked as il 
she’d snoop around during my ab- 
sences, and it certainly would Be 
difficult to explain mercury drops 
on the floor. 

The setup for my work was this. 
Across the street, in the 25-year- 

15 



old, rundown building were four 
apartments. My concern was the 
upper story on the right side, fac- 
ing the street. But I soon found 
out that the apartment just below 
was also to be intimately involved. 

The apartment upstairs was 
reached by climbing a steep series 
of steps, carpeted with frayed and 
faded material. A long hall at the 
top of the stairs ran the length of 
the building, ending in a bathroom 
at its far end. 

The back bedroom was occupied 
by Diana, the 20-year-old, unmar- 
ried daughter and her 20-month- 
old daughter, Pam. The grandpar- 
ents, Tom and Claudia Bonder, 
slept in the other bedroom. Tom 
also did his writing in this room. 
Claudia was 45 and Tom was 49. 

When I looked through the spec- 
analyzers, via the tap-beam, I saw 
the baby, Pam, as the bright light 
I had seen coming in over Los 
Angeles. She was the big Thrust 
Potential. 

Sometimes, the light was 
dimmed. Not because its source 
was weakened. No. It darkened be- 
cause of the hatred pouring out of 
the grandfather. 

This black cataract was, seem- 
ingly, directed mainly at the peo- 
ple in the apartment below. If ha- 
tred were water it would have 
drowned the people below. And, if 
they were what Tom Bonder said 
they were, they deserved drowning, 
if not worse. 


TX7atching that building was like 
* ^watching the Northern Lights 
during a meteor shower on the 
Fourth of July. I ignored the pyro- 
technic displays of the tenants on 
the other side of the building. 
They had little to do with the 
“stoking” and the follow-up. 

Tom Bonder, ah, there was a 
splendid spectacle. Although he 
had been depressed in his youth, 
at which time he must have radi- 
ated heavy-drag black, like smoke 
from Vesuvius, he had semicon- 
verted his youthful depression into 
middle-aged anger. Reversed the 
usual course of psychic events, you 
might say. Now he looked like Ves- 
uvius in eruption. 

Bonder, the grandfather, was de- 
termined not to fail as a grand- 
father just because he had failed 
as a father, husband, lover, son, 
teacher, writer — and you name it. 

And, truly, he had failed, but 
not as badly as he thought, or, I 
should say, desired, since he lusted 
for defeat. Rage poured out of him 
day and night, even when, especi- 
ally when, he was sleeping. 

What most infuriated him was 
the uproar beating' upwards day 
and night from the Festigs down- 
stairs. The Festigs were a father, 
40 years old, a mother, 28, and a 
daughter, Lisa 2. From the time 
they arose, anywhere from 9:30 to 
11:30, until they went to Bed, mid- 
night or 1:00, or later, the mother 
was shouting and bellowing and 

IF 


16 



singing and clapping her hands pillow-covered ears of Tom Bom- 


sharply and the little girl was 
screaming with glee but usually 
Wailing or screeching with frustra- 
tion and anger. The father was si- 
lent most of the time; he was like 
an old sunken Spanish galleon, bur- 
ied in black silt, with his treasures, 
his pieces-of-eight and silver ingots 
sand gold crosses, spilled out of a 
breach in the hull and only oc- 
casionally revealed when the cur- 
rents dredged away some mud. 

Oh, he was depressed, depressed, 
which is to say he was a very an- 
gry man indeed. The black heavy 
stuff flowed from Myron Festig 
like a Niagara fouled with sewage. 
But sometimes, out of boredom, as 
he sat on his chair in the living 
room, he groaned mightily, and the 
groan went up and out the windows 
and into the windows of the apart- 
ment upstairs. 

And Tom Bonder would start 
when he heard the groan and 
would quit muttering and raging 
under his breath. He would be si^ 
lent, as one lion may fall silent Ibf 
a moment when he hears the roar 
of another from far away. 

The screaming joys and buzz- 
saw tantrums were enough for the 
Bonders (not to mention the next- 
door neighbors) to endure. But the 
child also had the peculiar habit 
of stomping her feet if she ran or 
walked. The sound vibrated up 
through the walls and the floors 
land through the bed and into the 

DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


er. Even if he managed to gel ft 
sleep, he would be awakened a» Awn 
en times by the foot-stompiags er 
by the screams and the bellows^ 
He would sit up and cmse. 
Sometimes, he would loosen his 
grip on Ids fear of violence and 
would shout out of the window: 
“Quiet down, down there, you bar- 
barians, illiterate swine! We bate 
to get up early to go to work! Wfe^re 
not on relief, you bloodsucking in- 
considerate parasites!” 

The reference to relief , if noth- 
ing, else should have turned My- 
ron Fes tig’s depression into rage, 
because the Festigs were one of He 
few people in Beverly Hills Iviag 
on relief. The relief came from the 
county welfare and from money 
borrowed from Mrs. Festig’s moth- 
er and doctor brothers. Occasion- 
ally, Myron sold a cartoon or took 
a temporary job. But he was very 
sensitive about the welfare money, 
and he would have been astounded 
to learn that the Bonders knew 
about it. The Bonders, however, 
had been informed about this by 
the manager’s wife. 

Rachel Festig, the wife and 
mother, was revealed in the analy- 
zer as intermittent flashes of white, 
which were philiac thrust, with 
much yellow, that is, deeply re- 
pressed rage sublimated as sacri- 
ficial or martyred love. And these 
was the chlorine-gas green of self- 
poisonous self-worship. 


17 



B ut there was the bright white 
light of the Bonder baby, 
Pam. Now that I was near it, I 
saw it split into two, as a star seen 
by the naked eye will become a 
double star in the telescope. The 
lesser star, as it were, radiated 
from Lisa Festig. All infants, un- 
less they’re born psychotic, have 
this thrust. Lisa’s, unfortunately, 
was waning, and its brightness 
would be almost entirely gone in 
a year or so. Her mother’s love 
was extinguishing it in a dozen 
ways. 

But the far brighter white, the 
almost blinding Thrust Potential, 
radiated from the Bonder grand- 
daughter. She was a beautiful, 
strong, healthy, good-humored, in- 
telligent, extremely active, and 
very loving baby. She was more 
than enough to cause her grand- 
parents to love her beyond normal 
grandparental love. But they had 
reason to especially cherish this 
baby. She was illegitimate. The 
father had dropped out of sight in 
West Venice, not that anybody was 
looking for him. 

Furthermore, both Claudia and 
Tom felt that they had been psy- 
chically distorted by their parents 
and that they, in turn, had bent 
their daughter, Thea. But Pam was 
not going to be fouled up, neurotic, 
nearneurotic, unhappy, desolate, 
and so on. At the moment, both 
the elder Bonders were going 
to psychoanalysts to get their psy- 


ches hammered out straight on the 
anvil of the couch. Mrs. Bonder 
was doing fine after years of pain- 
ful lonely feelings, suicide at- 
tempts, hospitalization, and 
hysterical flights home to her moth- 
er. In fact, she was on her way to 
being the only adult in her family 
who was aware of her drives and 
compulsions and able to handle 
them. 

The daughter had her problems, 
too, including schizophrenic ten- 
dencies, guilt, and an Oedipal con- 
flict which kept her from a normal 
closeness to her father. But neither 
she nor Mrs. Bonder, though they 
figured significantly and were to 
be used by me, had the importance 
in my plans that Tom Bonder, the 
grandfather, had. 

Why? Because he was an atheist 
who had never been able to shake 
himself free of his desire to know 
a God, a hard-headed pragmatist 
who lusted for mysticism as an al* 
coholic lusts for the bottle he has 
renounced, a scoffer of religions 
whose eyes became teary whenever 
he watched the hoakiest, most pu- 
tridly sentimental religious movies 
on TV with Bing Crosby, Barry 
Fitzgerald and Humphrey Bogart 
as priests. This, plus the tiniest 
spark of what, for a better term, 
is called pre-TP, and his rage, 
made me choose him. As a matter 
of fact, he was the main tool I had 
for the only plan I had. 

Myron needed to be dependent, 

IF 


18 



to be, at 40, an invertebrate, a 
waxingly fat invertebrate. Yet he 
wanted to be a world-famous car- 
toonist, a picture-satirist of the 
modern age, especially in its psy- 
chic sicknesses. Recently, in a 
burst of backbone, he had stayed 
up all night for several weeks, 
when his family was sleeping, and 
drawn an entire book of cartoons 
about group therapy. He knew the 
subject well, since he was a parti- 
cipant in a group and also had pri- 
vate sessions once a week. Both 
were paid for by arrangement with 
the county and his brother-in-law, 
the doctor. 

The cartoon book was published 
and sold well locally, then the ex- 
citement died down and he sub- 
sided into a great roll of unbone- 
stiffened protoplasm. Depres- 
sion blackened him once more, and 
he gained a hunger for food in- 
stead of fame, and so he ate and 
swelled. 

Tom Bonder worked daytimes as 
an electronic technician at a space 
industry plant in Huntington 
Beach, and evenings and weekends 
he wrote fast-action private-eye 
novels for paperback publishers 
and an occasional paperback west- 
ern. 

He loathed his technician job 
and wanted to go into full- 
time fiction writing. However, he 
was having enough trouble writing 
part-time now because of the up- 
roar downstairs— 


Ill 

T used the tap-beam and sight- 
“*■ beam to listen and look into 
the apartments and also to eaves- 
drop on Bonder’s sessions with the 
analyst. I knew he ascribed his 
problems to a too-early and too- 
harsh toilet training, to a guilt 
caused by conflict between his 
childhood curiosity about sex and 
his parents’ harsh repression of it 
and so on. His main problem 
throughout most of his life had 
been a rigid control over himself. 
He thought himself a coward be- 
cause he had always avoided vio- 
lence, but he was finding out in 
therapy that he feared that he 
might become too violent and hurt 
the other person. 

Fortunately, he was now getting 
rid of some of his anger in little 
daily spurts, but, unfortunately, 
not swiftly enough. 

He was always on the verge of 
going berserk. 

Berserk 1 That was the key to 
my “stoking.” 

The Ship must have been losing 
speed even worse than we of the 
crew had been told. About six 
months after I got into Beverly 
Hills, I received a call from The 
First Mate again. 

“How’s the setup coming along?” 

“As well as can be expected,” I 
said. “You know you can’t stoke- 
too fast, sir. The engine might i 
overheat or blow,” 


DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


19 



“I know that, you cabin-boy re- 
ject!” fie bellowed so loudly that 
I turned the volume down. Old 
Mrs. Klugd quite often kept her 
ear pressed to the tenants’ doors. 

I said, "I’ll use more pressure, 
sir, but it’ll have to be delicately 
applied. I sure wouldn’t want to 
wreck this little engine. Her nim- 
bus looks as if she could provide 
enormous thrust, if she’s brought 
along properly.” 

“Three hours you get,” The 
First Mate said. “Then we have to 
have 1,000,000® T units.” 

Three hours of Ship’s time was 
30 Earth-years. Even if I got the 
stoking done quickly, I had a hell 
of a lot of hard mercury-sweating 
Work in the next 30 years. I prom- 
ised I’d do my best, and The First 
Mate said that that had better be 
better than good enough, and he 
signed off. 

Tom Bonder and Myron Festig 
were working themselves closer to 
that condition I’d been working 
for. The Festig child was stomping 
her feet and screaming all day and 
until one in the morning, and the 
inability to get sleep was putting 
black circles around Tom Bonder’s 
eyes. And red halos of wrath 
around him. 

Myron Festig Was deep in the 
sludge pit of despond. His latest 
cartoon had been turned down by 
Playboy . He had just been fired 
from a job as a cheese salesman. 
His mother-in-law was threatening 


to visit for several months. The 
car needed new tires. “I’d thhmei 
them down one night.” His broth- 
er-in-law, the doctor, was need- 
ling him because he wasn’t making 
a steady income, aside from wel- 
fare payments. And Rachel, Ms 
wife, when not chewing him out 
for his inability to hold a job, was 
crying that they should have an- 
other baby. They needed a son;- 
she would deliver him a boy to 
make him proud. 

The last thing Myron wanted 
was another mouth to stuff, and, 
though he dared not say it, an- 
other noisy mouth and big heavy 
feet to distract him from his car- 
tooning. 

'Tpom Bonder would have agreed 
1 with this. He was, he told his 
wife, slowly being herded to sui- 
cide or homicide. He could not 
take much more of this. And more 
frequently, as if in jest, he would 
open a drawer in the kitchen and 
take out a hand-axe, which he had 
brought out of the Midwest. And 
he would say, “One more night of 
thumping from Little Miss Buffa- 
lo Stampede, one more night of 
bellowing ‘Myron!’ or ‘Rachel!’, 
and I go downstairs and chop up 
the whole swinish bunch 1” 

His wife and daughter would 
grin, nervously, and tell him he 
shouldn’t even joke like that. 

“Fm fantasizing!” he’d cry. “My 
beadshrinker says it’s good therapy 

W

to imagine slaughtering them, very 
healthy. It relieves the tendons. 
As long as $ can fantasize, I won’t 
take action 1 But when I can’t fan- 
tasize, Beware! Chop! Chop! Off 
with their headsi Blood will flow” 
and he Would swing the axe while 
he grinned. 

Sometimes, exasperated Beyond 
endurance, he would stomp his 
foot on the floor to advise the Fes- 
tigs that their uproar was Intoler- 
able. Sometimes, the Festigs would 
quiet down for a while. More of- 
ten, they ignored the hints from 
aboye or even Increased the vol- 
ume. And, once, Myron Festig, en- 
raged that anyone should dare to 
object to his family’s activities 
(and also taking out against the 
Bonders the rage he felt against 
himself and his family) slammed 
his foot angrily against the floor 
and cried out. 

Mr. Bonder, startled at first, 
then doubly enraged, slammed his 
foot Back. Both men then waited 
to see what would happen. Noth- 
ing, however, followed. 

And this and other events or 
nonevents are difficult to explain. 
Why didn’t Tom Bonder just go 
down and have a talk with the 
FestigsK Why didn’t he communi- 
cate directly, face to face, with 
words and expressions? 

I’ve watched human beings for 
a million years (my body was 
shaped like a ground ape’s then), 
and I still don’t know exactly why 

22 


they do or don’t do certain things. 

Bonder’s overt problem Was com- 
munication. Rather, the lack there- 
of. He kept too rigid a control ever 
himself to talk freely. Which may 
be why he turned to writing. 

He probably did not go down to 
tell the Festigs how they were dis- 
turbing him because, to him, even 
a little anger meant a greater one 
would inevitably follow, and he 
could not endure the thought of 
this. And so he avoided a direct 
confrontation. 

Yet, he was getting more and 
more angry every day; his safety 
valve Was stuck, and his boilers 
were about to blow. 

I can tell by your expression 
what you’re thinking. Why don’t 
we build ‘engines’ which will auto- 
matically put out the required 
thrust? 

If this were possible, it would 
have been done long ago. 

The structure of the universe, 
that is, of The Ship, requires, for 
reasons unknown to me, that phil- 
iac thrust be generated only by 
sentient beings with free will. Auto- 
matons can’t love. If love is Built 
into, or programmed into, the auto- 
maton, the love means nothing in 
terms of thrust. It’s a pseudoleve, 
and so a pseudothrust results, and 
this is no thrust at all. 

No. Life has to be created on 
viable planets, and it must evolve 
until it brings forth a sentient be- 
ing. And this being may thei be 

IF 



manipulated, pulled and pushed, 
given suggestions and laws, and so 
forth. But the blazing white thrust 
is not easy to come by, and the 
black drag is always there. It’s a 
hideous problem to solve. And hid- 
eous means often have to be used. 

And so, obeying my orders, I 
speeded up the stoking. Far faster 
than I liked. Fortunately, a num- 
ber of events occuring about the 
same time three months later help- 
ed me, and everything converged 
on one day, a Thursday. 

'T'he evening before, Myron Fes- 
tig had gone on the Joseph 
Beans TV Show to get publicity 
for his group-therapy cartoon book, 
although he had been warned not 
to do so. As a result, he was sting- 
ingly insulted by Beans and his 
doltish audience, was called sick 
and told that group therapy was a 
mess of mumbo-jumbo. Myron was 
smarting severely from the savage 
putdown. 

On the next day, Tom Bonder 
was 21/2 hours late getting home 
The motor of his car had burned 
out. This was the climax to the in- 
creasing, almost unendurable, frus- 
tration and nerve-shredding caused 
by the 5-day-a-week 2-hour round- 
trip from Beverly Hills to Hunt- 
ington Beach and back on the free- 
way. In addition, his request for a 
transfer to the nearby Santa Mon- 
ica plant was lost somewhere on 
the great paper highway of inter- 

DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


departmental affairs of the astro- 
nautics company, and the entire 
request would have to be initiated 
again in triplicate. 

Two days before, Myron had 
been fired from another job. He’d 
made several mistakes in giving 
change to customers because he 
was thinking of ideas for cartoons. 

Tom Bonder found his wife did 
not want to listen to his tale of 
trouble with the car. She had had 
a setback in therapy and was also 
upset about some slights her doc- 
tor employer had given her. 

After tapping in on Myron’s ac- 
count to his wife of how he lost 
his job, I made an anonymous 
phone call to the welfare office 
and told them that Myron Festig 
had been working without report- 
ing the fact to them. -They had 
called Myron to come down and 
explain himself. 

Myron Festig’s brother-in-law, 
the doctor, wanted part of his loan 
back. But the Festigs were broke. 

Tom Bonder, on coming home, 
was received with a letter of re- 
jection. The editor to whom he had 
sent his latest private-eye thriller 
had turned it down with a number 
of nasty remarks. Now Bonder 
wouldn’t be able to pay all of next 
month’s bills. 

Myron Festig’s mother, the day 
before, had called him and begged 
him, for the hundredth time, to ac- 
cept his aged father’s offer to be- 
come his junior partner in his 

23 



business. He should quit being a 
nogoodnik ‘artist” who couldn’t 
support his wife and child. Or, for 
that matter, himself. 

Moreover, and this as much as 
anything sent him skiing out of 
control bn the slopes of despair, 
,his psychiatrist had gone on a two- 
weeks’ yacation in Mexico. 

And, that very morning, Myron 
got word that one of the group in 
therapy, a lovely young woman 
whom Myron was becoming very 
fond bf, had lifted the top of her 
head with i .45 automatic. 

Tom Bonder flushed the toilet, 
ana if filled up and ran all over 
the bathroom floor. Bonder sup- 
pressed his desire to yell out ob- 
scenities and denunciations bf his 
landlord because he did not want 
to upset his granddaughter, and he 
called the plumber. This incident 
was the latest in a long series bf 
blown fuses in the old and over- 
loaded electrical circuits and the 
backing of dirty waters in the old 
and deteriorating plumbing. 

Rachel Festig told Myron that 
he had to get another job and 
quickly. Or she was going to work, 
and he could stay home to take 
care bf the child. Myron sat in the 
big worn easy chair and just looked 
at her, as if he were an oyster with 
5 o’clock shadow and she were a 
strange fish he was trying to iden- 
tify. Rachel became hysterical and 
raved for an hour (I could hear 
her across the street through my 

24 


open window, I didn’t need my 
tap-beam) about the psychic dam- 
age to Lisa if her mother left her 
to go to work. Myron was so silent 
and unresponsive that she became 
frightened and left him for a while. 

The plumbers finally left. The 
baby, who had been awakened by 
their activities, finally went back 
to sleep. Tom Bonder sat down at 
his desk in the crowded bedroom 
to start writing a story for a mys- 
tery magazine. If he wrote it quick- 
ly enough and the editors did not 
dawdle reading it, and bought it, 
and then 'did not dawdle in send- 
ing his money, he might have 
enough to pay next month’s bills. 
He wrote two paragraphs, using his 
pencil so that the typewriter 
wouldn’t wake up the baby. 

The thumping of Lisa’s feet and 
her screaming as she ran back and 
forth from room to room disturbed 
him even more than usual. But be 
clamped his mental teeth and wrote 
on. 

Then Rachel began to march 
along behind Lisa, and she sang 
loudly (she always said she could 
have been a great anger if she 
hadn’t married Myron), and she 
clapped her hands, over and over. 

It was now ft PM. The baby 
stirred in her crib. Then, after 
some especially heavy crashing of 
Lisa’s feet, Pam cried out. Tom’s 
daughter came into the back bed- 
room and tried to quiet her down. 

Tom Bonder reared up from hfs 

W 



desk his flailing hand scattering 
papers onto the floor. He stalked 
Into the kitchen and opened a bot- 
tom drawer with some difficulty. 
As usual, it stuck, and he had to 
get down on his knees and yank at 
it. This time, he did not mutter 
something about fixing it someday. 

He took out the hand-axe and 
walked through the front room, 
hoping his wife would see it. 

IV 

S he curled her lip and said, 
“Don’t be more of an ass than 
God made you, Tom. You’re not 
scaring anybody with that.” 

And then, “Why aren’t you 
writing? You said you couldn’t 
talk to me because you had to 
write.” 

He glared at her and said noth- 
ing. The reasons for his anger were 
so obvious and justified that she 
must be deliberately baiting him 
because of her own turmoiled feel- 
ings. 

Finally, he grunted, “That men- 
agerie downstairs.” 

“Well, if you have to fantasize, 
you don’t have to hold that axe. 
It makes me nervous. Put it away.” 
He went back into the kitcheU. 
At that moment, I phoned. 

His wife said, “Get the phone. 
If anybody wants me, I’m out to 
the store. I don’t feel like talking 
to anyone tonight, except you, and 
you Won’t talk to me.” 

DOWN IN THE BUCK GANG 


.Violently, he picked up the 
phone and said, harshly, “Hefip” 

I was watching the whole scene 
directly on the tap-beam, of course, 
and at the same time was display- 
ing the Fes tigs’ front room on i 
viewer. 

I mimicked Myron Festig’s 
voice. “This is Myron. Would you 
please be more quiet up there? We 
can’t think with all that noise.” 

Tom Bonder yelled an obscenity 
and slammed down the phone. He 
whirled, ran out into the hall, pad 
charged down the steps with the 
axe still in his hand. 

Rachel and Lisa had stopped 
their parade, and Myron had risen 
from his chair at the thunder on 
the staircase. 

I hid started to dial the Festig’s 
number as soon Os I’d finished 
with Tom Bonder. The phone 
rang when Bonder reached the bot- 
tom of the steps. MyroB, who was 
closest to the phone, answered. 

I mimicked the voice of Myron’s 
mother. I said, “Myron 1 If you 
don’t go into business with your 
father at once, I’ll never ever have 
anything any more to do with you, 
my only sofi, God help meT What 
did I ever do to deiserye a son like 
you? Don’t you love your aged 
parents?” And I hung up. 

Tom Bonder was standing Out- 
ride the Festigs’ door with the Sxe 
raised when I ran out Of my apart- 
ment building. I was wearing a po- 
liceman’s uniform, and I was ready

for Mrs. Klugel if she should see 
me. I meant to tell her I was going 
to a costume ball. She did not, 
however, come out of her room 
since her favorite TV show was on. 

I walked swiftly across the 
street, and not until I got on the 
sidewalk dig Tom Bonder see me. 
• 

T Te could have been beating on 
* the door with his axe in a 
maniac effort to get inside and kill 
the Festigs. But his abnormally 
powerful self-control had, as I’d 
hoped, reasserted itself. He had 
discharged much of his anger by 
the obscenity, the energy of ag- 
gression in charging down the 
stairs, and the mere act of raising 
the axe to strike the door. Now he

stoo3 like the Tin Woodman when 
the rain rusted his joints, motion- 
less, his eyes on the door, his right 
arm inj the air with the axe in his 
hand. 

EE coughed; he broke loose. He 
whirled and saw the uniform by 
the nearby street light. My face 
was in the shadows. 

I said, “Good evening,” and 
started back across the street as if 
I were going home after work. I 
heard the door slam and knew that 
•Tom Bonder had run back into his 
apartment and doubtless was shak- 
ing with reaction from his anger 
and from relief at his narrow es- 
cape from being caught in the act 
by f£ policeman. 

Once in my apartment, I used 
DOWN JN THE BUCK GANG 


the tap beams to observe the situ- 
ation. Tom Bonder had opened the 
door and tossed the axe onto the 
floor in front of the Festigs’ door. 

It was his obscure way of com- 
municating. Quit driving me cjrazy 
with your swinish uproar, or the 
next time ... 

I’m sure that the (chopping of 
the axe before the Festigs was, at 
the same time, an offer of peace. 
Here is the axe which I have bran- 
dished at you . / no longer, want 
it; you may have it. 

And there was a third facet to 
this seemingly simple but actually 
complicated gesture, as there is to 
almost every human gesture. He 
knew well, from what Rachel had 
told his daughter, and from what 
he had observed and heard direct- 
ly through the windows that My- 
ron was on as high and thin a 
tightrope as he. So, the flinging 
down of the axe meant also: Pick 
it up and use it. 

Tom Bonder did not realize this 
consciously, of course. 

I had thought that Tom Bonder 
might do just what he had done. 
I knew him well enough to chance 
that he would. If he had acted 
otherwise, then I would have had 
to set up another situation. 

Myron opened the door; he must 
have heard the thump of the hat- 
chet and Bonder’s steps as he wont 
back up the stair s. He picked it 
up after staring at it for a full min- 
ute and returned to his easy chair. 




He sat gain and put the axe on 
his lap. His fat fingers playeci frith 
the wooden handle land a thumB 
felt along the edge of the head. 

Rachel walked over to him and 
bent over so her face was only 
about three inches from his. She 
shouted at him; her mouth worked 
and worked. 

I didn’t know what she was say- 
ing because I had shut off the 
audio of their beam. I was forcing 
myself to watch, but I didn’t want 
to hear. 

[This was the first time I bad 
cut off the sound during a stoking. 
At that moment, I didn’t think 
about what I was doing or why. 
Later, I knew that this was the 
first overt reflection of something 
that had been troubling me for a 
long long time. 

All tiie elements of the situation 
(I’m talking about the Festigs, 
now) had worked together to make 
Myron do what he did. But the 
final dement, the fuse, was that 
Rachel looked remarkably like his 
mother and at that moment was 
acting and talking remarkably like 
her. 

The black clouds which usually 
poured out of him had Been slowly 
turning a Bright red at their bases. 
Now the red crept up the clouds, 
like columns of mercury In a bank 
of thermometers seen through 
smoke. Suddenly, the red exploded, 
shot through the black, over- 
whelmed the black, dissolved it in 


scarlet, and filled the room with a 
glare. 

Myron seemed to come up gut 
of the chair like a missile from Its 
launching pad* He pushed Riche] 
with one hand so hard that she 
staggered back halfway across the 
room, her mouth open, jelled In the 
middle of whatever she had Been 
screaming. 

He stepped forward and swung. 

I forced myself to watch as he 
went towards the child. 

When Myron Festig was through 
with the two, and he took a long 
time, or so it seemed to me, he 
ran into the kitchen. A moment 
later, he came back out of the 
kitdien door with a huge butcher 
knife held before him with Both 
hands, the point against his solar 
plexus. He charged across the 
room, slammed into the wall and 
rammed its hilt into the wall an 3 
ran the knife through him. The 
autopsy report was to state that the 
point had driven into his Back- 
bone. 

I turnSI the audio Back on then, 
although I could hear well enougB 
through my apartment window. H 
siren was whooping some blocks 
away. The porchlight had Been 
turned on, and the manager, his 
wife, and juvenile daughter were 
standing outside the Festigs 9 door* 
Presently, the door to the Bond- 
ers’ apartment opened, and Mrs. 
Bander came out. Tom Bonder fol- 
lowed a minute later.

IF 



The manager opened the door to 
the Festigs’ apartment. Tom Bond- 
er looked Into the front room be- 
tween the manager and the side of 
the doorway. 

H e swayed, then stepped back 
until he bumped into Mrs. 
Bonder. The blood was splashed 
over the walls, the floors, and the 
furniture. There were even spots of 
It on the ceiling. 

The broken handle of the axe 
lay in a pool of blood. Its head 
was buried somewhere. 

I turned the beam away from 
the Festigs and watched Tom 
Bonder. He was on his knees, his 
arms dangling, hands spread open 
stiffly, his head thrown back, and 
his eyes rolled up. His mouth 
moved silently. 

Then there was a cry. Pam, the 
baby, had gotten out of her crib 
and was standing at the top of the 
steps and looking down at die half- 
open door to the porch and crying 
for her mother. Then ran up to her 
and held her in her arms and 
soothed her. 

At the cry, Tom Bonder shook. 
No nimbus except the gray of sleep 
or trance or semiconsciousness had 
welled from him. But then a fin- 
ger of white, a slim shaft of bright- 
ness, extended from his head. In a 
minute, he was enveloped in a star- 
ry blaze. He was on his feet and 
taking Mrs. Bonder by the hand 
an£j going up the steps. The police 

DOWN IN THE BLACK GANG 


car stopped before the building. 
The siren died, but the red Eght 
on top of the car kept flashing. 

I packed my stuff in my three 
bags and went out the back en- 
trance. It was now highly probable 
that Tom Bonder would take the 
course I had planned. And, since 
he was a highly imaginative man, 
he would influence his granddaugh- 
ter, who, being a Thrust Potential, 
would naturally incline toward the 
religious and the mystical. And 
toward love. And those in charge 
of her development would see that 
she came into prominence and then 
into greatness in later life. And, af- 
ter the almost inevitable martyr- 
dom, they would bring about the 
proper followup. Or try to. 

They would. I wouldn’t.

t CD rain ships don’t 'disappear,” 
Helva said in what she 
Hoped was a firm, no-argument 
tone. 

Teron stuck his chin out in a 
way that caused him to appear a 


neckless neanderthal. This man- 
nerism had passed from amusing 
through annoying to unendurable. 

“You heard Central,” Teron re- 
plied at his most didactic. “They 
ido disappear because they have 
disappeared.” 

“The fact of disappearance is in- 


45 



consistent with shell psychology,” 
Helva retorted, bardy managing to 
restrain herself from shouting at 
top volume. She had the feding 
that she might force him to under- 
stand by overwhelming him with 
sound alone. She knew this was 
basically illogical but In trying to 
cope with Teron over the past gal- 
actic year, she found she reacted 
more and more on an emotional 
rather than a reasonable level. 

This partnership was dearly in- 
tolerable — die would even go so 
far as to say, degrading — and she 
would allow it to continue no long- 
er than it took them to finish this 
assignment and return to Regulus 
Base. 

Helva had had enough of Teron. 
She did not care two feathers in a 
jet-vent if the condusion wasn’t 
mutual. It had been difficult for 
her to admit she had found her- 
self in a situation she couldn’t ad- 
just to, but she and Teron were 
clearly incompatible. She would 
just have to admit to an error of 
judgment and correct it. It was the 
only sensible course of action. 

Hdv3 groaned inwardly. He was 
contagious. She was talking more 
and more as he did. 

“Your loyalty is commendable, 
if, in this instance, misplaced,” 
Teron was saying pompously. “The 
facts are there. Four brain con- 
trolled ships engaged on Central 
Worlds commissions have disap- 
peared without trace, their accom-

panying pilots with than. Fad:; a 
ship can alter Its tape, S pilot can- 
not. Fact: the ships have failed to 
appear at a scheduled port-of-call. 
Fact: the ships have failed to Ap- 
pear In the adjacent sectors of 
space nearest their previous or pro- 
jected ports-of-call. Therefore, they; 
have disappeared. The ships must 
have altered the projected journey; 
for no known reason. Therefore the 
ships are unreliable organisms. This 
conclusion follows the presented 
data and is unalterable. Any rat- 
ional intelligence must admit the 
yalidity of that conclusion.” 

He gave her that irritating 
smirk she had originally thought a 
sweet smile. 

Helva counted slowly to one 
thousand by tens. When she spoke 
again, her yoke was under perfect 
control. 

“The presented data is incom- 
plete. It lacks motivation. There is 
no reason for those four ships to 
have disappeared for their own 
purposes. They weren’t even badly 
indebted. Indeed, the DR was 
within three standard years of sol- 
vency.” Just as she was, she 
thought. “Therefore, and on the 
basis of privileged information

available to me . She came as 
close as makes no never mini to 
spitting out the pronoun. “ ... your 
conclusion is unacceptable” 

“I cannot see what privileged in- 
formation, if you actually have 
any,” Teron said, awarding her a 
patronizing smile, “could change 
my conclusion since Central has 
also reached it.” 

rj^here, Helva thought to herself, 
he had managed to drag in old 
infallible authority, and that was 
supposed to stop her in her tapes. 

It was useless to argue with him 
anyway. He was, as Niall Parollan 
had once accused her of being, 
stubborn for the wrong reasons. He 
was also pig-headed, dogmatic, in- 
sensitive, regulation-hedged and so 
narrowly oriented as to prevent 
any vestige of imagination or in- 
tuitive thinking from coloring his 
mental processes for a micro sec- 
ond. 

She oughtn’t to have thought of 
Niall Parollan. It did her temper 
no good. That officious little pip- 
squeak had paid her another of his 
unsolicited, unofficial visits to ar- 
gue her out of choosing the Ac- 
thionite. 

“He passed his Brawni training 
on theory credits. He’s been slated 
for garbage runs, not you\” Niall 
Parollan had cried, pacing her 
main cabin. 

“And you are not the person who 
will be his partner. His profile-tape 


looks extremely compatible to me,” 

“Use your wits, girl. Just lee£ at 
him. He’s all muscle and no hsgrt, 
too perfectly good looking to fee 
credible. Christ, he’s • . he’s su$ an- 
droid, complete with metal brain- 
works, programmed in a ratified 
atmosphere. He’ll drive yon bat- 
ty.” 

“He’s a reliable, well-balanced, 
well-read, well-adjusted ...” 

And you’re a spiteful tin-plated 
virgin,” snapped Parollan, and lor 
the second time in their acquaint- 
ance he charged out of her cafein ff 

Now Helva had to admit Niall 
Parollan had been demoralizingly 
accurate about Brawn Teron of Ac- 
thion. The only kind thing that 
could be said about him, in Hdva’s 
estimation, was that he was a com- 
plete change from any other part- 
ner she had bad, temporarily or 
permanently. 

And if he called her an unreli- 
able organism once more, she 
would blow the lock on him. 

However, Teron considered be 
had silenced her with the last tell- 
ing remark. He seated himself at 
his pilot control board, flexed his 
fingers as he always did, and then 
ran his precious and omnipotent 
data through the computer, check- 
ing their journey tape. It was ob- 
vious he was out to thwart any ir- 
rational desire Helva might have 
to change their journey and mafe 
them disappear, as the other four 
ships had. 


THE SHIP WHO DISAPPEARED 


47 



Teron worked methodically and 
slowly, his broad brow imwrinkled, 
his wide-cheeked face serene, his 
brown eyes never straying from the 
task at hand. 

TTow under the suns of heaven, 
■H-did she ever have the incredi- 
ble lack of insight to pick him ?; 
Helva wondered, the adrenalin lev- 
el in her shell still high. She must 
have been out of her ever-loving, 
capsulated mind. Maybe her nutri- 
ent fluid was going acid. When she 
got back to Regulus, she was go- 
ing to demand an endocrine check. 
Something was wrong with her. 

No, no, no. Helva contradicted 
herself. There was nothing wrong 
with her that getting rid of Teron 
wouldn’t cure. He had her doubt- 
ing her sanity and she knew she 
was sane or she wouldn’t be this 
ship. 

Remember that, Helva, she told 
herself. It was quite possible that, 
before this trip ended, he’d have 
persuaded her she was a menace 
to Central Worlds Autonomy be- 
cause her intelligence was so unre- 
liable and the safest thing for the 
known world would be for her to 
opt out. Him and his assumption 
that a brain ship must be an un- 
reliable organism because they/ 
she/he (never it, please) could di- 
gest data, ignore the irrelevant and 
proceed oh seemingly illogical 
courses io logical and highly suc- 
cessful ends — such as the tangle 


she and Kira had got into on AU- 
oth. 

And to quote particulars, she, 
Helva, had already been unreliable 
several times in her short career as 
a brain ship. Teron had been kind 
enough to point out these devia- 
tions to her, as well as a far more 
logical course of action under all 
the same conditions, and he had 
admonished her never to act out- 
side cut orders .while he, Teron of 
Acthion, was her brawn partner. 
She was to do nothing, repeat, 
nothing, without clearing first with 
him and then with Central. An in- 
telligent organism was known by 
its ability to follow orders without 
deviation. 

“And you actually mean,” Helva 
had remarked laughingly the first 
time Teron had made this solemn 
pronouncement — she had still had 
her sense of humor in those days 
— “that, if our orders required me 
to enter an atmosphere my subse- 
quent investigations proved was 
corrosive to my hull and would re- 
sult in our deaths, I should follow 
such orders ... to the death, that 
is.” 

“Irresponsible orders are not 
given Central Worlds Ships,” Ter- 
on replied reprovingly. 

“Half a league, half a league, 

Half a league onward ..." 

“I do not understand what half 
leagues have to do with the prin- 
ciple under discussion,” he said 
coldly. 


48 


IF 



“I was trying to make a subtle 
point I wiU rephrase.” 

“In a concise, therefore compre- 
hensible, manner, if you please.” 
“Orders can be cut without fore- 
knowledge of unavailable but high- 
ly relevant facts. Such as the be- 
fore - mentioned corrosive atmo- 
spheres ...” 

“Hypothetical ...” 

“ . but valid as a case in point. 
We do, you must admit, often ap- 
proach relatively unexplored star 
systems. Therefore, it is entirely 
possible, not merely hypothetical, 
that pre-cut orders can require an 
intelligent and mature re-evalua- 
tion which may require what ap- 
pears to be insubordinate alteration 
of those same orders and/or rank 
disobedience to those orders.” 

'T'eron had shaken his head, not 
t -*• sadly because Helva was cer- 
tain he had experienced no deep 
human emotions in his life, but re- 
provingly. 

“I know now why Central Worlds 
insists on a human pilot as com- 
mander of the brain - controlled 
ships. They are necessary, so nec- 
essary when an unreliable organism 
is nominally in control of so power- 
ful an instrument as this ship.” 
Helva had sputtered in astonish- 
ment at his misconception. She had 
been about to point out that the 
pilot control board did not over- 
ride her. She had the override on 
the pilot. 


“There will come a day,” Tartu 
had continued inexorably, “when 
such poor expedients are no longer 
necessary. Automatic operations 
wiU be perfected to such a fine de- 
gree that human brains will no 
longer be needed.” 

“They use human beings” Hd- 
ya had replied, pronouncing each 
syllable distinctly to emphasize the 
fact that the whole body, not At 
cranium alone, was included. Me- 
chanically controlled ships — even 
cerebral ships — had proved high- 
ly unsatisfactory in performance, 
especially where initiative might be 
required. 

The brain-brawn combinations 
were the perfect solution. 

“Ah, yes, human beings. Fallible 
creatures at best, we are, subject 
to so many pressures, so frail a 
barque for so great a task.” Teton 
tended to go in for homiletics at 
the drop of a gauge. ‘To err is hu- 
man, to forgive divine.” He sighed. 
“And when this human element, so 
prone to err, is eliminated, when 
automation is perfected — ah, 
there, Helva, is the operative word 
— when it Is perfected, there will 
be no more need for such stop-gap 
techniques as Central Worlds must 
presently employ. When that per- 
fection is achieved, ships will be 
truly rdiable.” He patted the com- 
puter-console patronizingly. 

Helva had stifled a monosyllable. 
Historical and incontrovertible ar- 
guments welled up from her SChoel-

THE SHIP WHO DISAPPEARED 



ing and conditioning years. These 
were based, she abruptly realized, 
on incidents which unfortunately 
tended to support his peculiar the- 
ory of unreliability — however 
sane the outcome. In each in- 
stance, the brain ships had acted 
by ignoring or revising previous or- 
ders as the unusual circumstances 
they encountered required them to 
do. By Teron’s unswerving logic, 
intelligence itself — whether shel 
or mobile — was unreliable. Helva 
could not see him ever admitting 
that intelligent conclusions were not 
always logical. 

And right now, every scrap of 
intelligence, instinct, training, con- 
ditioning and reason told Helva 
that brain ships did not just disap- 
pear. Not four in a row. Not four 
in less than a Regulan month. One 
in a hundred years, yes, that Was 
possible, logical and probable. But 
there was always some hint, some 
deducible reason. The ship she had 
discovered on Alioth, for instance, 
had lost her brawn and had gone 
psychotic in grief. She disappeared. 
It had been logically assumed the 
ship had opted out and buried it- 
self in a sun. The 732 had indeed 
attempted suicide but missed its 
mark, dying years later when Hel- 
va and her brawn, Kira, had found 
it. 

TT7hy had she allowed Kira to 
* * leave her when that assign- 
ment was over? Kira would have 


been quite of Helva’s mind in this 
matter, but Helva did not see the 
faintest hope of convincing Teron 
that multiple disappearances were 
so preposterous. Because it involved 
some intuition, of which Teron had 
none. 

How had this didacticism of his 
escaped Psychprobe? And another 
thing she had noticed about him, 
whether he would ever admit it 
consciously or not: the very con- 
cept of cyborgs like Helva was re- 
pugnant to Teron. A brawn was 
very much aware, if the majority 
of Central Worlds’ populations were 
not, that behind the ship’s titanium 
bulkhead reposed a shell, contain- 
ing the pituitarily and surgically 
stunted, inert but complete human 
body. When Helva had been Bom 
physically deformed, into a world 
of physical perfection, her parents 
had elected to donate their day- 
old child to Central Worlds Gov- 
ernment. By-passing her damaged 
nerves, her brain synapses had been 
linked to the controls of a small 
jet-propelled shell first, and later 
to a large, slim, faster-than-light 
scout ship in the Medical Service 
of Central Worlds. 

Helva and her kind had been so 
thoroughly conditioned to their 
shell life that there were not even 
trace longings to be released from 
their unusual immolation. Freed of 
certain purely physical stresses and 
stimuli, they benefited by posses- 
sing curiously sharpened percep- 

IF

tions and instincts for inter-human 
relationships. Complex internal con- 
trols gave them sight and sound o{ 
inhuman versatility. Helva could 
project a whisper a furlong from 
her. She could turn her vision up 
to a magnification of 100,000 times 
normal or project it telescopically 
five hundred miles planetbound — 
where atmospheric conditions inter- 
fered with clarity — or one thou- 
sand space miles. Olfactory and 
tactile senses were translated into 
atmospheric pressures and compo- 
sitions, heat-cold tolerances of her 
ship’s skin. 

As an avocation, Helva had 
studied pure voice production to 
the point where she could sing in 
any tessitura used by human vocal 
chords and some exotic variations 
such as the Reticulan mating croons 
and the hiss-dick percussions of 
the Ophiuchian spider people. Her 
unique skill had caused her, in her 
first tour of duty, to become 
known as the ship who sings. With 
the death of her first brawn, Jennan 
Sahir Silan, her interest in vocal 
artistry had waned. Now, in this 
partnership with Teron, she was 
raising her voice far more in schism 
than song. 

As a matter of fact, Teron had 
taken such exception to this epithet 
that she dreaded calling on planets 
where she had sung. Indeed, he did 
his best to dehumanize her. Yet Be 
was the one who consistently acted 
in a mechanical fashion. It was as 


if he were determined to live 
according to pre-set, pre-program- 
med directives, without allowance 
for mistake, fatigue or disease. 

If he weren’t so thoroughly ag- 
gravating, she could almost feel 
sorry for him. And before he had 
antagonized her, she had actually 
understood this drive toward per- 
fection which motivated every 
thought and action. Teron was psy- 
chotically afraid of error, of making 


any mistake because mistake im- 
plied failure and failure was Inad- 
missible. If he made no mistakes, 
he would never be guilty of failure 
and would be a success. 

Well, Helva mused, she was not 
afraid of making a mistake iand she 
wasn’t afraid of admitting failure. 
And she’d surely made one with 
Teron. When he started mistrusting 
shell people, he was no good to her 
or Central Worlds. Wdl, she would 


not be vindictive. She would re- 
quest a change and take the fine. 
It wouldn’t set her too far back in 
the red. And with a new partner 
and a couple of good assignments, 
she’d still pay-off. But Teron was 
going off her deck! 

The decision of divorce, now sub- 
vocalized, made her feel much bet- 
ter. 


W fien Teron woke the next 
day, he checked as he always 
did, every gauge, dial and meter, 
forward and aft. This practice took 
him most of the morning. A s imila r 


THE SHIP WHO DISAPPEARED

rundown would have taken Helva 
ten minutes at the outside. By cus- 
tom and by any other brawn but 
Teron, the check was left to the 
brain partner. Wearily Helva had 
to read back to Teron her findings 
which he corroborated with his own. 

“Shipshape and bristol fashion,” 
he commented as he always did 
when the results tallied ... as they 
always did. Then he seated himself 
at the pilot console awaiting touch- 
down on Tania Borealis. 

As the TH-824 had had planet- 
falls on Durrell, Tania Borealis* 
fourth planet, before, the spaceport 
was familiar with Teron — familiar 
with and contemptuous to the point 
of addressing all remarks to Helva 
rather than to her brawn. If it com- 
plimented Helva, it made Teron 
harder to deal with later. He re- 
sponded by being twice as officious 
and pompous with the port officials 
and the Health Service Captain to 
whom their cargo of rare drugs had 
been assigned. A certain amount of 
extra precaution was required, con- 
sidering the nature and potency of 
the drugs, but it was offensive of 
Teron to tight-beam back to Cen- 
tral Worlds for a replica of Captain 
Brandt’s ID cube before turning 
over the invaluable packet to him. 

To make matters worse, Niall 
Parollan, being Section Supervisor, 
had had to take the call and Helva 
caught all the nuances in his care- 
fully official words. 

Helva seethed inwardly. It would' 


have to be Parollan. But she had the 
heretofore unexperienced urge to 
burst outward from her shell in aH 
directions. Parollan would be un- 
bearably righteous no matter when 
she filed intent to change brawns. 
There were three more stops, one 
at Tania Australis and the two 
Alula counterparts before she would 
touch down at Regulus Base. Bet- 
ter let Niall Parollan have his laugh 
now so he’d be over it by the time 
she did ditch Teron. 

So, girding herself for Parollan’s 
smug reception, Helva flashed a pri- 
vate signal for him to keep the tight- 
beam open. Teron, slave that he was 
to protocol, would see Captain 
Brandt off the ship and to the wait- 
ing landcar. She’d have a chance 
to file her intention then. 

“Tower to the TH-824. Permis- 
sion to board you requested by 
the Antiolathan Xixon,” said Dur- 
rell Tower. 

“Permission refused,” Helva 
snapped without so much as a 
glance in Teron’s direction. 

“Pilot Teron speaking,” the 
Brawn interjected forcefully, strid- 
ing to the console and opening the 
local channel direct. “What is the 
purpose of this request?” 

“Don’t know. The gentlemen are 
on their way by ground car.” 

'Teron disconnected and glanced 
out the open airlock. Brandt’s 
car was just passing the oncoming 
vehicle midfield.

“You have no right to issue 
jrders independently, Helva, when 
the request has been properly 
sSted.” 

“Have you ever heard of an 
Antiolathan Xixon?” Helva de- 
mands. “And isn’t this a restricted 
mission?” 

“I am perfectly aware of the 
nature of our mission and I have 
never heard of an Antiolathan 
Xixon. That doesn’t mean there 
Isn’t one. And, as it sounds religious 
and one of our prime Service dir- 
ectives is to be respectful to any 
and all religious orders, we should 
receive him.” 

“True enough. But may I remind 
Pilot Teron that I am his senior 
in service by some years and that 
I have access to memory banks, 
mechanical memory banks, less 
prone to lapsus memoriae than the 
human mind? And there is no 
Xixon.” 

“The request was issued proper- 
ly,” Teron repeated. 

“Shouldn’t we consult Central 
first?” 

“There are some actions which 
are indicated without recourse to 
official sanction.” 

“Oh, really?” 

The groundcar had arrived and 
the Xixon-people had dutifully re- 
quested permission to board. Their 
arrival meant no chance for Helva 
to speak privately with Central. She 
was doubly infuriated by Teron’s 
childish insistence on seeing who- 


ever these Xixop were. She knew 
perfectly well that if she. had 
countermanded Us order, be would 
have been in the right of it to tall 
her down. But since he had taken 
the initiative, naturally it was all 
in order. 

The four men stepped on board, 
two in plain gray tunics, stepping 
smartly inside the lock as though 
the yanguard of a great dignitary. 
Sidearms hung from their belts and 
both wore curious cylindrical whis- 
tles on neckchains. The third man, 
gray of hair but vigorous, obsequi- 
ously ushered in the fourth, a white- 
haired man of imposing stature in 
a long, gray-black robe. He fing- 
ered a whistle, larger than the 
guards’ but similar in design, as if 
it were some kind of sacred talis- 
man. 

There was something not at all 
reassuring, Helva noted, in that 
obsequious performance. For the 
gray-haired man, in the action of 
ushering, was missing no single de- 
tail of the cabin’s appointments. 
Just as he switched his direction to 
put him beside Teron, who was still 
at the control console, the old man 
reached the titanium bulkhead be- 
hind which Helva resided. The ma- 
neuvers were almost completed 
when something in Helva’s mind 
went wild with alarm. 

“Teron, they’re imposters,” she 
cried, remembering with sudden 
hope that the right-beam to Central 
Worlds was still open. 


THE SHIP WHO DISAPPEARED 


S3 



The white-haired m an lost all 
trace of formal dignity and, mouth- 
ing syllables in a frightful cadence, 
stabbed a finger toward her column. 

Helva, in the brief moment be- 
fore she lost consciousness, saw the 
two guards blowing on their whis- 
tles, the piercing notes sonically 
jamming the ship’s circuitry. She 
saw Teron slump to the floor of the 
cabin, felled by the gray-haired 
man. Then the anesthetic gas the 
old man had released into her shell 
overwhelmed her. 

T Ter circuits were out of order, 
^ Helva mused. And then she re- 
turned to acute awareness. 

She saw nothing. She heard noth- 
ing. Not so much as a whisper of 
sound. Not so much as a tiny beam 
of light. 

Helva fought a wave of primeval 
terror that all but washed her into 
insanity. 

I think so I live, she told herself 
with all the force of her will. She 
could think and she could remem- 
ber, rationally, calmly, what had 
happened, what could have hap- 
pened. 

The horror of complete isolation 
from sound and light was a micro- 
meter away from utter domination 
of her ego. Coldly, dispassionate- 
ly, Helva reviewed that final, flash- 
ing scene of treachery. The en- 
trance of the four men, the arran- 
gement of the two guards and their 
whistle-ornaments. A supersonic 


blast patterned to interfere with her 
circuity, to paralyze her defense 
against the unauthorized activation 
of her emergency panel. The man- 
euvering of the third man to over- 
power Teron. 

Now, Helva continued inexorably, 
this attack was engineered to over- 
come brawn and brain simultane- 
ously. Only someone intimately 
connected with the Central Worlds 
Would have access to the informa- 
tion needed to vanquish both mo- 
bile and immobile units. The re- 
lease syllables and the proper pitch 
land cadence at which they must be 
spoken were highly guarded secrets, 
usually kept separate. For anyone 
to have known this information 
alone was shocking. 

Helva’s mind leaped to an ob- 
vious, but still startling conclusion. 
She knew now how the four brain 
ships had disappeared. They had 
unquestionably been shanghaied in 
much the same way she had been. 
But why? And where were the 
others? Incommunicado like her- 
shelf? Or driven mad by... 

She refused to consider that pos- 
sibility for herself or any other 
shell personality. 

Constructive thought, fierce con- 
centration, would relieve the present 
tedium. 

The first ship to disappear was 
the FT-687. They had also been 
on a drug run, picking up raw 
material, though, not distributing 
it. So had the RD-751 and the PF- 


54 


IP 





699. This line of thought bore pos- 
sibilities. 

The drags which she had been 
delivering were available only 
through application to Central 
Worlds and were delivered in mi- 
nute quantities by special teams. A 
one hundred cc ampoule of Men- 
kalinite could poison the water of 
an entire planet, rendering its pop- 
ulation mindless slaves. A granule 
of the same drag diluted in a mas- 
sive protein suspension base would 
inoculate the inhabitants of sever- 
al star systems against the virulent 
encephalitis plagues. Tucanite, a 
psychedelic compound, was invalu- 
able for psychotherapy in cata- 
tonic and autistic cases for it 
heightened perceptions and aware- 
ness of environment. The frail el- 
ders of Tucan had revived waning 
psionic powers with its use. Deadly 
as these drugs might be in one form, 
they were essential to millions in 
another and must be available. The 
damodean sword of use Sn3 abuse 
forever swung perilously over the 
collective head of mankind. 

N ot even a shell person was 
sacred from the machinations 
of a disturbed mind. 

Disturbed mind?] Helva’s 
thoughts ground down. Where was 
that idiot brawn of hers right now? 
Him and his neanderthal attributes 
— his muscles — would be very 
useful. She felt a distinct pleasure 
within herself as she recalled his 


being clouted wickedly by the third 
man. She hoped he was bruised, 
beaten and bloodied. But at least 
he could see and hear without am- 
plification . 

Helva felt every crevass of her 
mind quivering with the effects of 
sense deprivation. How long could 
she keep her mind channeled away 
from .

SOUND! 

A scraping metallic sound. But 
a sound upon her aural circuits. 
Like a hot iron in her brain, a 
fiery brand of sanity after the 
dense, thick, solid, infinite inquiet 
soundlessness. She screamed, but 
having no connections except the 
aural, screamed soundlessly. 

in 

Something was thundering: “I 
^ have reconnected your sound 
system!” 

Helva tuned the volume rapidly 
down to an acceptable level. The 
voice was harsh, whining, nasal, un- 
pleasant, but the sense divinely 
welcome. 

“You have been disconnected 
from your ship function.” 

The words made no immediate 
sense. She was listening to the 


glory of sound and the sensation of 
noise was unbelievable agony. It 
took a moment for those syllables 
to re-form themselves into compre- 
hensible tones. 

“You have been connected to a 
limited audio-visual circuit to per- 
mit you to retain your sanity. Any 
abuse of thi s courtesy will result in 
further if not permanent, depriva- 
tion.” A nasty laugh accompanied 
the threat. 

Unexpectedly, sight returned, an 
evil benison because of the object 
in her lens. She could not suppress 
the scream. 

“This is your idea of coopera- 
tion?” demanded the strident voice; 
and a huge cavern, spiked with 
great ivory tusks, opened directly 
in front of her, pink and red and 
slimy white. 

She adjusted vision hastily, put- 
ting the face into normal propor- 
tions. It was not a pleasant face, 
even at proper size. It belonged to 
the man, no longer disguised as bid, 
who had styled himself the Antio- 
lathan Xixon. 

“Cooperation?” Helva asked, 
confused. 

“Yes, your cooperation of noth- 
ing.” [The Xixon moved his hand 
to one side of her limited vision, 
wrapping his fingers around input 
leads. 

“No. I’ll go mad,” Helva cried, 
alarmed, frightened. 

“Mad?,” Her tormentor laughed 
obscenely. “You’ve plenty of com- 


THE SHIP WHO DISAPPEARED

pany. But you shan’t go mad . 
not yet. I have a use for you.” 

A finger dominated her lens like 
a suspended projectile 

“No, no, fool, not like thatl” 
Her captor shrieked and dashed 
off to one side of her screen. 

Desperately assembling her wits, 
Helva tuned up her hearing, sharp- 
ened her sight focus. She was fac- 
ing a small audio-visual amplifica- 
tion pand into which were plugged 
her leads and those of... yes... 
she could count twelve other input 
lines. She had only one line of vis- 
on, straight ahead. Directly in 
front of her, before the panel, were 
two shells, trailing fine wires like 
fairy hair from their blunt tops. 
Within those shells existed two of 
her peers. There should be two 
more. She had a peripheral glimpse 
of more wires. 

Carefully, she drew against the 
power in the amplifier. A very lim- 
ited capacity. To her left, whence 
the Xixon thing had gone, was the 
beginning of a complex interstellar 
communications unit from the look 
of it and the few dial readings she 
could see. 

Xixon returned, smiling a mock- 
ing, smug smile at her. 

“So you are the ship who sings. 
The Helva obscenity. May I pre- 
sent your fellow obscenities. Of 
course, Foro’s company fa limited 
to groans and howls. We kept him 
in the dark too long.” The Xixon 
howled with pure spite. “Delia’s 


not much better, true, but she will 
speak if spoken to. Tagi and Merl 
have learned not to talk unless I 
address them. So shall you. For I 
have always wanted my own zoo 
of obscenities and I have them all 
in you. And you, my latest guest, 
will cheer my leisure hours with 
your incomparable voice. Will you 
not?” 

TJTelva said nothing. She was in- 
stantly plunged into utter 
dark, utter soundlessness. 

“He is mad himself. He is doing 
this to terrify me. I refuse to be 
terrified by a i madman. I will wait. 
I will be calm,” she told herself. 
“He has a use for me so he will 
not wait too long before giving me 
right and sound again or he will 
defeat his purpose. I will wait. I 
will be calm. I will soon have sight 
and sound again. I will wait. I will 
be calm but soon, oh soon ...” 

“There now, my pretty awful, 
you’ve had time to reconsider my 
generosity.” 

Helva had indeed. She limited 
her capitulation to a monosyllable. 
The blessedness of right and sound 
could not quite erase the seemingly 
endless hours of deprivation; yet 
she knew, from the chronometer on 
the panel board, that he had shut 
her off for a scant few minutes. It 
was frightening to be dependent on 
this vile beast. 

She refilled her vision, scanning 
his eyes closely. [There was a faint 


58 


i 



but .unmistakable tinge of blue to 
his fijdn tone which tagged him as 
eit&r a native of Rho Puppis’ 
three habitable worlds or a Tucan- 
ite addict. The latter seemed the 
more Jikely. For one thing, she had 
been carrying Tucanite and she 
knew! the RD had, also. 

“Fed like singing now?” His 
laugh was demonic. 

“Sir?” said a tentative and serv- 
ile Joice to her left. 

[The Xixon turned, frowning at 
the Interruption. 

“Well?” 

“The cargo of the 834 contained 
no Menkalite.” 

“None I” Her captor whirled 
Back to Helva, his eyes blazing. 
“Where did you squander it?” 

“At Tania Australis,” she re- 
plied, purposefully keeping her 
voice low. 

“Speak up,” he screamed at her. 

“Pm using all the power you’ve 
allowed me. That amplifier doesn’t 
produce much.” 

“It’s not supposed to,” the Xixon 
snapped irritably, his eyes restless- 
ly darting around the room. Sud- 
denly there was his finger obscur- 
ing |11 other objects from her vis- 
ion. “Tell me, which ship is to de- 
liver Menkalite next?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Speak up.” 

“I feel that I am shouting al- 
ready.” 

“You’re not. You’re whispering.” 

“Is this Better?” 


“Well, I can hear you. Now, tell 
me, which ship is next to deliver 
Menkalite?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Will you remember better in 
darkness?” His laugh echoed hol- 
lowly in her skull as he plunged 
her back into nothingness. 

S he forced herself to count 
slowly, second speed, so that 
she had some reference to time. 

He did not keep her out very 
long. She wanted to scream simply 
to fill her mind with sound, yet 
she managed to keep her voice 
very low. 

“Isn’t it any better?” he de- 
manded, scowling suspiciously. “I 
took that Foro obscenity off com- 
pletely.” 

Helva: steeled herself against the 
compassion she felt. She comforted 
herself with the knowledge that 
Foro had already been mindless. 

“For speech, it is sufficient,” she 
said, raising her volume just slight- 
ly. She could not use that ploy 
again, for it would cost Merl or 
Tagi or Delia what fragile grip 
they had on sanity. 

“Humph. Well, now, see that it 
does.” 

He disappeared. 

Helva heightened her listening 
volume. She could hear at least ten 
different movement patterns be- 
yond her extremely limited vision. 
From the reverberations of sound, 
they were in some large but low- 


THE SHIP WHO DISAPPEARED 


SO 



ceilinged, natural rock cavern. Now, 
if the main communications panel, 
part of which was visible to her, 
was a standard planetary model, if 
there were not too many chambers 
beyond this one to diffuse the 
sound, and if all the madman’s per- 
sonnel were nearby, she might just 
be able to do something. 

He wanted her to sing, did he?. 

She waited and she kept calm. 

Presently he returned, rubbing 
absently at his shoulder. Helva in- 
creased magnification and noticed 
the increase of the subcutaneous 
blue. He used Tucanite, then. 

A chair was produced from some- 
where for him, and he settled him- 
self. Another disembodied hand 
provided a table on which a dish of 
choice foods was set. 

“Sing, my pretty obscenity, 
sing,” the mad Xixon commanded, 
reaching languorously above his 
head toward her input leads. 

Helva complied. She began in 
the middle of her range, using the 
most sensuous songs she could re- 
member, augmenting them subtly 
in bass reflex but keeping the yol- 
ume tantalizingly low so that he 
had to crouch forward to hear her. 

It got on his nerves ind when he 
peevishly reached out to snatch all 
but her leads from the board, she 
begged him not to deprive her peers 
of sense. 

“Surely, sir, you could not, when 
all you need do is augment my 
power just slightly from the main 


board. Even without their very 
minute power drain on this ampli- 
fier, I could not possibly Reficul- 
ate a croon, for instance.” 

He sat up straight, his eyes 
flashing with anticipation. 

“You can Reticulate the mating 
croons?” 

“Of course,” she replied with 
mild surprise. 

Tie frowned at her, torn between 

* a desire to hear those re- 
nowned exotic songs and a yery 
real concern to limit her shell’s 
ability. He was deep in the thrall 
of the Tucanite now, his senses 
eager for further stimulation and 
the lure of the Reticulan croons 
was too much for him. 

He did, however, call over and 
consult with a fawning technician, 
who blinked constantly and had a 
severe tic in one cheek. Fascinated, 
Helva magnified until she was able 
to see each muscle fibre jerk. 

She was plunged into dark sound- 
lessness and then suddenly felt re- 
newed with the sense of real power 
against her leads. 

“You have ample power now, 
singer,” he told her, his expression 
vicious with anticipation. “Perform 
or you will regret it. And do not 
try any shell games on me, for I 
have had them seal off all the bther 
circuits on this amplifier. §j£fg, 
shipless one, sing for your sight ing 
sound.” 

{She waited until his laughter gied. 

IE

Even a Reticulan croon could not 
be heard ... or be effective . 
above that cackling. 

She took an easy one, double- 
voicing it, treble and counter, test- 
ing how much power she could get. 
It would be enough. And the echo 
of her lilting croon came back, 
boundngly, to reassure her that this 
installation was not large and was 
set in natural stone caverns. Very 
good. 

She cut in the overtones, gradual- 
ly adding bass frequencies but sub- 
fly so they seemed just part of the 
Reticulan croon at first. Even with 
his heightened sensibilities, he 
wouldn’t realize what she was doing. 
She augmented the inaudible fre- 
quencies. 

Her croon was of a particularly 
compelling variation, and she heard, 
under her singing — if one would 
permit Reticulan croons such a 
dignified title — the stealthy ad- 
vance of his slaves and co-workers, 
lured close by the irresistible siren 
sounds. 

She gathered herself and then 
pumped pure sonic hell into the 
triple note. 

It got him first, heightened as 
he had been by the Tucanite. It 
got him dead, his brain irretriev- 
ably scrambled from the massive 
dose of sonic fury. It got the others 
in the cavern, too. She could hear 
their shrieks of despair over the 
weird composite sound she had 
created, as they fainted. 


The overload shortcircuited sev- 
eral panels in the master board, 
showering the unconscious and the 
dead with blinding sparks. Helva 
threw in what breakers she eenU 
to keep her own now reduced eiv- 
cuit open. 

But even she felt the back- 
lash of that supersonic blast. Her 
nerve ends tingled, her hearing sang 
and she suddenly felt extremely 
enervated. 

“I’ll bet I’ve developed a very 
acid condition in my nutrients,” she 
told herself with a bit of graveyard 
humor. 

The great room was silent except 
for hoarse breathing and kissing 
wires. 

“Delia? Answer me. It’s Helva.” 

“Who is Helva? I have no access 
to memory banks.” 

“Tagi, can you hear me?” 

“Yes.” A flat, mechanical affir- 
mative. 

“Merl, can you hear me?” 

“You’re loud.” 

Helva stared straight ahead at 
the dead body that had torture# 
them so cruelly. Oh, for a pair of 
hands 1 

Revenge on an inert husk was 
illogical. 

Now what do I do? she wonder- 
ed. 

At that point she remembered 
that she had been about to divorce 
Teron Arid the VighUbeam had keen 
left open f Parollan wasn’t the hand 
to sit on his hands. Where was he?

CCnphere you are, Helva, back at 
-*• the old stand,” the ST-1 
Captain said, patting her column 
paternally. 

She scanned to make certain the 
release plate was locked back into 
seamless congruity with the rest of 
the column. 

‘Your new cadence-syllable re- 
lease was tuned into the metal, and 
Chief Railly is the only one who 
knows it,” the Captain assured her. 

“And the independent audio and

“Good idea, that, Helva. May 
make it a standard procedure.” 
“But mine are hooked up?” 
“Yes, yours are hooked up. Seems 
like a case of asking for clearance 
when the ship has blasted off, this 
precaution after the fact, but...” 
“Have you ever been sense-de- 
prived, Captain?” 

He shuddered and his eyes dark- 
ened. None of the Fleet or Brain- 
Brawn Ship personnel who pene- 
trated the Xixoh’s asteroid head- 
quarters would be likely to forget 
the pitiable condition of the shell 
people: the amplified human be- 
ings who had once been considered 
invulnerable. 

“Tagi, Merl and Delia will re- 
cover. Delia will be back in service 
in a year or so,” the Captain said 
quietly. Then he sighed, for he 
couldn’t bring himself to name

Foro either. “You people are need- 
ed, you know.” He leaned forward 
so suddenly, toward her panel, that 
Helva gasped. “Easy, Helva.” An3 
he slid his hand down the column. 
“Nope. Can’t even feel the seam. 
You’re all secure.” 

He carefully gathered up the de- 
licate instruments of his profession, 
wrapping them in soft, spongy sur- 
gi-foam. 

“How are the brawns?” she asked 
idly, as she stretched out along her 
rewired extensions, shrugging into 
her ship skin. 

“Well, Delia’s Rife will pull out 
of Menkalite addiction. He’d only 
had the one dose. They’ve still to 
track down the other two ships but 
I expect all the brawns will sur- 
vive.” 

His expression altered abrupt- 
ly as if he had caught an unpleas- 
ant smell. “Why did you have your 
tight-beam channel open, Hdva? 
When we got that brawn of yours 
out of his padded cell, he was fur- 
ious that you could disregard prop- 
er procedure in such a fashion.” The 
Captain managed to sound like Te- 
ron for a moment. “Why, if you 
hadn’t, and Cencom hadn’t heard 
the whole damned thing .... How 
come you left the channel open?” 
“I’d rather not say, but since 
you’ve met Teron, you might do 
a little guessing.” 

“Huh? Well, whatever the rea- 
son, it saved your life.” 

“It took ’em long enough.” 

IF 



'~phe Captain laughed at her sour 
1 complaint “Don’t forget, you’d 
been cleared so your kidnappers 
just lifted off Durrell before your 
supervisor could stop them. But 
Parollan scorched the ears of every 
operator in frequency range getting 
Fleet ships after you. At that, with 
a whole sector to comb, and the 
drug runners using this asteroid off 
Borealis as a hideout, too close to 
Durrell to be even a probability, it 
took a little time.” 

“That Xixon thing was smart- 
mad, hiding right out in sight.” 

“Well, he had a high intdligence 
factor,” the Captain admitted. 
“After all, he made it into brawn 
training twenty-odd years ago.” 

That had been an unnerving 
development, Helva reflected. If 
he’d actually qualified and then 
developed neural maladjustments 
... He had taken enough Tucanite 
to break the deconditioning mind 
blocks — another matter that was 
going to be re-evaluated by Central 
Worlds as a result of this incident 
— and had managed to insinuate 
himself in maintenance crews on 
Regulus Base, laying the ground- 
work for his operation by the judi- 
cious use k of addictive drugs on key 
employees. Then, using Central 
World brain ships with drugged 
brawns under his control, he could 
have landed anywhere including 
Regulus Base. 

“I’ll be off now,” the Captain 
said, saluting her respectfully. “Let 


your own brawn take over new.” 

‘Not if I can help it/ Helva 
amended. 

Whatever bond of loyalty she had 
once had for Teron had dissolved 
as surely as she had been {Darted 
from her security. Teron, having 
decided that he was hopelessly In- 
carcerated, had stolidly composed 
himself to await the worst with calm 
dignity ... as any logical man ought 
to do. 

On anyone else’s tapes — includ- 
ing the captain’s, to judge by the 
expression on his face — such 
logic was cowardice; and that was 
Helva’s unalterable conclusion. Al- 
though she would grant that his 
behavior had been consistent. 

Delia’s Rife, on the other hand, 
had tried to break out. He had 
clawed a foothold in the padded 
fabric of his cell, lacerating hinds 
and feet in the attempt to regch 
the ceiling access hatch. Dizzy from 
a Menkalite injection, confused gfcd 
weak from starvation intended to 
allow the Menkalite to work un- 
hindered in his system, he had act- 
ually crawled as far as the airlock 
when the rescue group had amved. 

Helva let the ST-1 down the per- 
sonnel lift and ran a thorough hut 
hasty flip-check of herself, scanners, 
sensory meters, power-pile drive 
chamber, inventory. It was like re- 
visiting a forgotten treasury of mind- 
miracles. Helva wondered if she had 
ever before appreciated the yersi- 
tility incorporated in her ship body,

had really valued the power she had 
at her disposition, or cherished the 
ingenuity of her engineers. Oh, it 
Was good to be back together again. 

CC T Telva?” a low voice spoke 
* ^ tentatively. “Are you alone 
now?” It was Central Worlds on the 
light-beam. 

“Yes. The ST-1 has just left. You 
can probably reach him ...” 
“Shove him.” Then Helva recog- 
nized that the hoarse voice must 
belong to Niall Parollan. “I j'ust 
Ranted to know you were back 
Sphere you belong. You’re sure you 
are all right, Helva?” 

Niall Parollan laryngitic with 
concern? 

Helva was flattered and sur- 
prised, considering the unflatter- 
ing description of her he’d hurled 
at her at their last parting. 

“I’m intact again, if that’s what 
you mean, Parollan,” she replied in 
droll good humor. 

She could have sworn she heard 
a sigh over the tight-beam. 

“That’s my girl.” Parollan 
laughed, so it must have been a 
wheeze she’d heard. “Of course, if 
you hadn’t had your synapases 
scrambled bn Beta Corvi, you’d 
have listened to me when I tried to 
tell you that that simple simian 
Acthionite was a regulation-bound 
brass ...” 

“Not brass, Niall,” Helva inter- 
rupted sharply, “not brass. Brass 
is a metal, and Teron had none.” 


“Oh ho ho, so you admit I was 
right about him?” 

“To err is human , . ” 

“Thank God!”* 

Just then Teron requested per- 
mission to board. 

“I’ll see you later, Helva. I 
couldn’t stomach ...” 

“Don’t go, Parollan ...” 

“Helva, my own true love, I’ve 
been glued to this tight-beam for 
three days for your sake, and the 
stimutabs have worn off. I’m dead 
in the seat!” 

“Prop your eyelids open for a 
few moments more, Niall. This will 
be official,” she urged Parollan as 
she activated the personnel lift for 
Teron. She felt a cold dislike re- 
place the bantering friendliness she 
had been enj’oying. 

Big as life and disgustingly nean- 
derthalic, her brawn strode into the 
main control room, saluting with 
scant ceremony toward her bulk- 
head. Strode? He swaggered, Helva 
thought angrily, looking not the 
least bit worse for his absence. 

Teron rubbed his hands together, 
sat himself down in the pilot’s chair, 
flexed his fingers before he poised 
them, very business-like, over the 
computer keyboard. 

“I’ll j'ust run a thorough check- 
down to be sure no damage was 
done.” 

His words were neither request 
nor order. 

“Just like that, huh?” Helva 
asked in a dangerously quiet voice.

^T'eron frowned and slewed round 
1 A in the chair toward her panel. 

“Our schedule has been inter- 
rupted enough with this mishap.” 

“Mishap?” 

“Modulate your tone, Helva. You 
can’t expect to use those tricks on 
me” 

“/ can’t expect what?” 

“Now,” he began placatingly, 
jerking his chin down, “I take into 
consideration you’ve been under a 
strain recently. You should have 
insisted that I oversee that ST-1 
Captain during that installation. 
You might have sustained some cir- 
cuit damage, you know.” 

“How kind of you to consider 
that possibility,” she said. That 
was it! 

“You could scarcely be harmed, 
physically, contained as you are in 
pure titanium,” he pointed out.

“Teron of Acthion, all I can say 
at this point is that it’s a damned 
good thing for you that I am con- 
tained behind pure titanium. Be- 
cause if I were mobile, I would kick 
you down that shaft so fast ...” 

“What has possessed you?” 

For once, sheer blank illogical 
amazement flashed across Teron’s 
face. 

“Get out! Get off my deck! Get 
out of my sight. Get OUT!” Helva 
roared, pouring on volume with each 
word, with no regard for the tender 
structure of the human ear. 

With sheer sound she drove him, 
hands clapped to the sides of his 


head, off the deck, down the side oi 
the 824 as fast as she could escalate 
the lift. 

“Take me for granted, will you? 
Unreliable organism, am I? Illogi- 
cal, irresponsible, and inhuman ...” 
Helva bellowed after him in a 
planet-sized shout. And then she 
burst out laughing as she realized 
that such emotional behavior on her 
part was the only way she could 
have routed the over-logical Teron 
of Acthion. 

“Did you hear that, Niall Parol- 
lan?” she demanded in a reason- 
able but nevertheless exultant tone. 
“Niall? Hey, Cencom, you on the 
tight-beam . answer me?” 

From the open channel came the 
shuddering discord of a massive 
adenoidal snore. 

“Niall?” 

The sleeper wheezed on, oblivious, 
until Helva chuckled at this addi- 
tional evidence of human frailty. 

She asked and received clearance 
from the asteroid’s half-ruined 
spaceport. She was going to have a 
long chat with Chief Railly. 

Her penalty for divorcing Teron 
would be a speck against the finders’ 
fee for four shanghaied BB ships. 
And there ought to be a Federation 
bonus for aid in the apprehension 
of drug runners. Totalled if true 
justice was given half a chance, 
the rewards might just make her 
a free ship, out of debt, truly her 
own mistress. The thought was 
enough to set her singing. END

There was a pause. Vel Senna "We are altering course towards

everyone on the airship had seen "Good,” said Vel Senna. "Choose 


67 



a safe landing place not less than 
half a mile from the valley. Take 
the ship down as soon as yon can.” 

Vel Senna plugged the speaking 
tube. The captain was reliable 
enough, for a native. He could be 
trusted to keep the airship a rea- 
sonable distance from the valley. 

Krau Sara was at the window of 
their observation room, studying 
the valley through a native-made 
telescope. He glanced up as Vel 
Senna joined him. " Aren’t we land- 
ing inside the valley ?” 

" Certainly not,” said Vel Sen- 
na. " Remember the priest’s warn- 
ing!” 

"Perhaps it’s for the best. I 
doubt whether we could land 
among those trees.” Krau Sara 
passed him the telescope. "Take a 
look.” 

Vel Senna accepted the telescope. 
He was a muscular centauroid be- 
ing, with purple hide and a single 
multi-faceted eye. He needed no 
dothing, but his three-fingered 
hands bore several jewelled rings. 
Those powerful hands held the 
telescope with a surprising deli- 
cacy. 

He and Krau Sara were high- 
ranking administrators who liked 
to spend their vacation years out 
in the colonies. This particular 
planet, discovered by the Senechi 
some five generations before, was 
known as 143-Arkon Three. The 
natives called it Earth. There were 
over fifty million natives, or hu- 


mans, and many of them were 
quite intelligent; this airship had 
been designed and built entirely 
by the natives. 143-Arkon Three 
was a pleasant world despite the 
ice-sheets covering most of its land 
surface, and Vel Senna had visited 
it twice before. 

Four days ago their hired air- 
ship had landed at a remote moun- 
tain valley called Inghota. Its main 
feature of interest was the Temple 
of Invisible Fire, which contained 
many sacred relics. Vel Senna had 
persuaded the old priest to tell 
them some of the ancient legends. 
The one which roused their inter- 
est was the story of the Summer 
Goddess, who lived in a cave full 
of gold and jewels in a mysterious 
ice-free valley far to the north. 
The two Senechi immediately de- 
cided to visit the valley. The priest 
tried to dissuade them, but his out- 
burst merely convinced the Sene- 
chi that there was some truth in 
the story. And now, four days lat- 
er, their airship had reached the 
valley. 

'T'he speaking tube whistled. Vel 
Senna opened it. 

"Captain Zing speaking, sir. We 
are about to land on the high 
ground between the ship and the 
valley. Is this convenient, or do 
you wish to land nearer it?” 

Vel Senna quickly identified the 
spot. It was a small rise where the 
ice probably concealed a low hill. 


IF 



The distance from the rise to the 
valley was three-quarters of a 
Senechi mfle — about one kilom- 
eter in the native measure. "Yes, 
this will do. Land at once.” He re- 
placed the cork. 

"Landing here?” asked Krau 
Sara. "We shall have nearly a mile 
to walk.” 

"We can use a sledge, if our 
guide is not too frightened of the 
goddess to drive us.” 

"Weston will give no trouble. The 
only one who seems frightened of 
the goddess so far is yourself.” 

"I am taking an elementary pre- 
caution, that is all,” said Vel Cen- 
na. He thought Krau Sara was tak- 
ing the priest’s warnings too light- 
ly. He was sure the native had 
been sincere. "There may not be 
a goddess, but there is something 
unusual below those tree-tops. A 
single ice-free valley in a zone of 
severe glaciation cannot be natural.” 

"It could be volcanic. Soon we 
will find out.” 

"Soon we shall find the gold,” 
said Vel Senna. 

Moments later, the airship set- 
tled gently on the ice. The valley as 
seen from the ground was a thin 
line of green near the skyline, 
with only the topmost branches 
visible. Nothing of the valley floor 
could be seen. 

Vel Senna uncorked the tube for 
the last time. "Captain, instruct 
our guide to drive us to the valley. 
Prepare a motor sledge at once.” 


Krau Sara was still gazing 
through the window. "The priest 
was right about the valley. I hope 
he was right about the treasure as 
well.” 

"And the goddess?” 

"The tale is centuries old. If she 
ever existed she has been dead for 
many years.” 

Vel Senna went to the door. 
"There is only one way to find out. 
To the sledge, my friend.” 

Krau Sara followed him down. 

'TT'he prisoner lived in silence, 
but the silence was in his mind. 

There were days when he could 
not remember who he was. He sat 
alone in the cave, in darkness, try- 
ing to recall Ms identity. It had 
been so long that sometimes he for- 
got he had ever had a name. Es- 
cape was the only dream he had. 

Every afternoon the prisoner 
went outside the cave and wan- 
dered idly through the sunken for- 
est. The grass was soft underfoot, 
and birds nested in the branches. 
The real world had been under the 
ice for longer than he could re- 
member, but within this timeless 
valley the Ice Age did not exist. 
Everything was green, and he 
hated it. Far in the distance he 
could see the ice-covered moun- 
tains, beckoning to him. They had 
the same cold beauty as the wom- 
an who possessed him. She walked 
in the forest too, but she never 
looked at the mountains. 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


69 



Early one afternoon, before it 
was time to go outside, the prison- 
er felt a strange stirring in his 
mind. He was thinking about his 
walks through the trees, and he 
realized that he could remember a 
time when all the world had been 
covered with trees. 

He lay quiet in his dark little 
corner of the cave rediscovering his 
past as it returned to him. It some- 
times happened like this, as the 
witch’s power lessened for a while; 
he became sane again. Gradually 
the cloud lifted. 

He had had a beginning. He had 
not always been in this valley. 
That was why he wanted to escape; 
he belonged to the world outside. 

It had been in the days when 
ice was something new and dread- 
ful. He and his two companions 
came to the valley, seeking to rob 
the mad woman of her jewels and 
precious metals. Her treasure was 
the wealth of a dozen forgotten 
nations. She was tall and fair- 
skinned, and wore a circlet of pale 
gold to match her hair. Her skin 
was smooth and clear, and she 
seemed still young. The men 
thought she would offer little re- 
sistance, but they were wrong. 

He was the only one to sur- 
vive. She killed his two compan- 
ions, and the men who came after. 
She stripped the flesh from their 
bodies and fashioned their bones 
into weird ship-like structures, 
wrapped around with gold leaf and 


laden with gems. Sometimes she 
made the skulls into grotesque 
figureheads for the skeleton-ships. 
The prisoner watched her do it, 
again and again, and his desire for 
the treasure faded away. 

TTe tried to think how long he 
had been here, but he could 
not remember. Parts of his mind 
were still gray. He recalled other 
passing spells of sanity, and his 
successful attempts to escape. He 
must escape now, today, before the 
clouds returned. 

His chance would come during 
his afternoon walk in the valley. 
There was another way to the out- 
side world — a huge air shaft at 
the back of the tunnels — but its 
walls were too steep to dimb. The 
valley was his path to freedom. In 
his usual state, possessed by the 
witch, he never dared leave the 
valley. This time it would be dif- 
ferent. 

He had to be careful. If he 
stayed too long in this corner, the 
witch might wonder what he was 
doing. It was time he went to join 
her, in the chamber where the 
Sleeper lay dreaming beneath his 
golden blankets. 

Quietly the prisoner walked 
down the tunnel towards the 
Sleeper. The way to the valley 
was through the main chamber, so 
he would have to wait until the 
witch let him go out. As he walked, 
he looked at the row of skeleton- 


70 


IF 










ships lining the wall on his left. 
There was just enough light to 
see them. The first ships were in 
the Sleeper’s chamber, where the 
witch worked, and the later ones 
stretched away end to end along 
the dark tunnels. Each ship meant 
another adventurer had died — but 
how often did treasure-seekers 
visit this distant valley? 

He kept his face impassive as 
he entered the chamber. The soft 
orange light seemed strong after 
the darkness of the tunnels. The 
witch did not look up from her 
work as she sat on the bare floor. 
She was cutting a ruby with a 
small knife which buzzzed stead- 
ily in her hand. Her long golden 
hair hung shining against her 
black dress on her shoulders. Its 
brightness made him think of sun- 
shine. She looked young, hardly 
more than twenty. She had looked 
the same on the day he and his 
two friends came to steal the jew- 
els. But he too had not changed, 
and he remembered the long line 
of skeleton-ships along the tunnel. 

The light in the cave was sup- 
plied by a crystal sphere suspend- 
ed from the ceiling. A burning 
brand was trapped within the 
sphere, giving out a pale orange 
light. The brand was never con- 
sumed. Even the flame had been 
frozen by the witch. 

Directly below the sphere was the 
eoudi of the Sleeper. Under his 
golden blankets the youth lay still 


and peaceful. The witch had cared 
for him well. Even more than the 
prisoner, the Sleeper was complete- 
ly in her power. He had no chance 
of escape at all. At least the pris- 
oner had his occasional days of 
sanity, unlike the Sleeper. 

He had such a day now. Soon 
the witch would take him out into 
the valley. He waited, and pres- 
ently the moment came. 

T ts engine roaring, the sledge 
^ slowed down and came to a 
halt on the edge of the ice. Weston, 
their native guide, switched off. 
The two Senechi stepped off the 
boards and stood on the thin froz- 
en crust. They looked down into 
the valley. 

”1 do not understand,” said Vel 
Senna. "I see only trees and grass. 
I see no trace of occupation. 
Where is the machinery needed 
to keep this area free of ice?” 

"It could be underground,” said 
Krau Sara, or those boulders at 
the northern end could be a camou- 
flaged heating unit.” 

Something was heating the val- 
ley. Thirty feet below them grew 
obviously natural temperate-zone 
flora. The trees were all decidu- 
ous, the highest having their tops 
level with the Senechi. The only 
animals in sight were a brown fur- 
ry tree-climber and several small 
birds. No humans were visible. 

"The place seems deserted,” 
said Krau Sara. He addressed the 


72 


IF 



guide. "Weston, bring the lamps. 
We shall look for the cave.” 
"No, sir,” said Weston. "Fm 
staying here.” 

The human sat firmly in his 
pilot seat. He had not left the 
sledge. 

"Did you hear that, Vel Senna?” 
"I understand Earth Basic as 
well as you. Weston, are you re- 
fusing to obey our orders?” 

"Yes, sir. I’m not going into that 
valley. I know what’s down there.” 
Vel Senna lifted his whip 
threateningly, but the native shook 
his head. Vel Senna knew this ges- 
ture meant refusal. 

"A native taboo against en- 
tering the holy place,” Krau Sara 
suggested in Senechi. 

"I agree. Weston expects the 
legendary goddess to destroy us.” 
Vel Senna spoke to the guide again, 
"Weston, we will overlook this 
matter. Give us the lamps and then 
take the sledge back to the air- 
ship. Return in three hours with 
lifting tackle and a towing sledge.” 
"Thank you, sir. I’ll arrange ev- 
erything.” Weston looked relieved 
for a brief moment. "And . 
Sir, I can’t stop you, but I think 
you shouldn’t go near that cave. 
Believe me, it’s more dangerous 
than you realize.” 

I appreciate your concern,” said 
Vel Senna patiently, "but we Sen- 
echi can protect ourselves.” 

The huge centauroids were larger 
and tougher than anything now na- 


tive to Earth. [They had no n eed 
of human guards. 

i 

i 

'T'hey watched Weston drive 
away, then returned to study- 
ing the valley. It did not look like 
a trap. 

"We should be cautious,” said 
Vel Senna. "Weston is compara- 
tively reliable, like the captain. He 
would not warn us of danger with- 
out good reason.” 

"The cave may be occupied by 
a wild beast if not by a goddess. 
There is always a first time for 
discovering a new species. I think 
a little caution is wise.” 

Vel Senna pointed to the upper 
end of the valley. "See that open 
space covered with boulders, and 
the bare rock of the cliff face. The 
stream appears to flow from there. 
It is the most likely place for a 
cave.” 

Krau Sara agreed. The two 
Senechi walked along the valley 
rim, their hooves sinking deep in- 
to the ice, until they reached a 
vantage point to look down on the 
fallen boulders. There were very 
few trees at this end; the ground 
was mainly exposed rock with a 
few patches of grass. In the cliff 
face were several promising shad- 
ows, and at last Vel Senna judged 
it safe to leave the ice. 

They scrambled down the slope 
to the rocky floor thirty feet be- 
low, trying to avoid any undue 
noise. They did not want to arouse 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


73 



anything in the cave, animal or 

goddess. 

"It is warm,” said Yel Senna, 
as he felt his skin adjusting to the 
higher temperature. "I wish I 
could see some of the heating equip- 
ment.” 

"It must be well camouflaged,” 
said Krau Sara. "I am certain these 
plants are survivals from the pre- 
glacial period. Time has stood still 
in this valley.” 

"The priest used those same 
words at the Temple of Invisible 
Fire. He has been right about 
everything so far.” 

"So far, Vel Senna. He 
could be wrong about the jew- 
els — and right about the god- 
dess, although I doubt it. We take 
the risk. Come, follow me towards 
the cave.” 

The two Senechi crept forward, 
close to the cliff face. Approaching 
the entrance in this way, they 
could not be seen from inside. 
Quietly they picked their way 
through the boulders. 

Suddenly they heard a faint 
sound ahead. They sank down up- 
on the stones, lowering their bod- 
ies right to the ground. They wait- 
ed. 

Two humans came out of the 
cave. One was a man, the other a 
woman. They walked into the trees 
without seeing the hidden Sene- 
chi. 

The man was old, and wore a 
brown trouser suit. Yel Senna 

74 


glimpsed a gray beard on his chin. 

The woman was much younger, 
wearing a long black dress which 
reached to her ankles. She had 
bright yellow hair which trailed out 
behind her. By native standards 
she was extremely beautiful. 

The goddess , thought Yd Sen- 
na. 

II 

J ohn Weston stood on the lower 
deck of the airship. The seven 
crewmen were facing him as he 
told them why he had returned 
without the aliens. The crew had 
seen him bring back the empty 
sledge. 

"We shouldn’t leave them in 
that valley,” said Mike Jones, the 
burly chief engineer. "We ought 
to go back before the three horns 
are up.” 

Weston shrugged. "I tried to 
stop them going down, but they 
wouldn’t listen. Still, maybe the 
witch only kills humans.” 

"Don’t you believe it,” said anoth- 
er engineer. "The witch kiBs any- 
one who goes after her treasure.” 
"This pair isn’t bad for Sene- 
chi,” said Mike. “They don’t hand 
out the floggings like some of these, 
third-generation types.” 

Ram Badal Zing was the cap- 
tain and part owner of the airship. 
He said, “Mr. Weston, you ac- 
companied our clients into the mu- 
seum of radiation studies. How 


IF 



much did the attendant tell them 
about the valley?” 

"Most of it,” said Weston, 
thinking back to that day in Ingho- 
ta. The attendant had described 
jthe cave and the treasure quite ac- 
curately. He had warned them 
about the witch. But he had 
not mentioned her son who was 
now dreaming away the centuries. 
“He didn’t say anything about the 
Sleeper. Maybe he didn’t want to 
interest them too much. He stop- 
ped answering their questions when 
he realized they wanted to go 
there.” 

"Perhaps you should have done 
the same,” said the captain. 

Mike had taken a quick look at 
the Senechi through a small tele- 
scope. "Don’t worry, they’re still on 
the ice. Our bosses have moved 
along a bit and now they’ve set- 
tled down to watch something. 
They aren’t rushing in there just 
yet.” 

"That’s better,” said Weston. "I 
thought they were going straight 
down. As long as they stay up 
here they’ll be all right.” 

All the same, he thought, Mike 
was right. If the Senechi did en- 
ter the vaUey, he ought to take 
the sledges back, just in case. Al- 
though, what could he do for the 
aliens if they were seen by the 
witch? 

"Well,” said Anna, "you may en- 
joy standing here doing nothing, 
but I don’t.” 


A nna Holm, a tall Nordic blonde, 
was their navigator. She 
pointed over the rail at the two 
aliens and continued, “They’ll 
pever miss one of the sledges. I’ll 
take one and check up on that 
pit we saw on the way down.” 

“I don’t . It’s highly kregu- 
lar,” said Captain Zing. 

Weston remembered seeing the 
pit as the airship landed — a cir- 
cular patch of shadow on the bril- 
liant white ice. It was near the 
valley but rather small, so maybe 
the Senechi hadn’t spotted it. 
Wanting to poke around it was 
typical of Anna. Crazy idtal He 
and Mike Jones came from a 
country where women were barred 
from holding responsible positions. 
The more he saw of Anna, the 
more he admitted the old folks 
had had some sense. That pit was 
only a queer-shaped creynsse . 

Then the implication hit him. 
The pit was along the line of the 
valley’s axis. Was it another cave 
entrance? It might be a new way 
into the Sleeper’s cave. 

“One sledge,” said Captain 
Zing, giving in reluctantly. 

"That’s settled, then,” said 
Anna. She thumbed the davit but- 
tons. "I’ll take this sledge. Ml be 
back well before the three hours 
are up.” 

"You are not going alone,” said 
Captain Zing. "Someone most ac- 
company you.” 

"Why don’t you?” she asked, 


THE FROZEN SUMMER

as her sledge was lowered automat- 
ically onto the ice. 

“HI go,” said Mike quickly. 
“You’re right, cap’n — someone’s 
got to keep an eye on her.” 

“I can take care of myself 1” 
“The Senechi thought so too,” 
said Weston. “I’m not so sure. I’ll 
come along with you. We’ll take 
the lifting gear they want on a 
trailer, so we can go straight from 
the pit to the valley to meet the 
bosses.” 

“Hmm,” said Anna. “It might 
save time. All right. Load up.” 
“One other thing,” said Weston 
to the captain. “If our bosses go 
into the valley, send someone over 
there. Flash us with a signal lamp 
if you need us.” 

“Certainly,” said Captain Zing. 
“You know best, Mr. Weston.” 
His tone implied the opposite. 
Zing didn’t like him, he knew. A 
good captain, though. 

Well, it didn’t matter. He was 
off to the pit with Anna Holm. He 
helped Mike finish loading the 
trailer. 

4 4/^ome along,” said the witch. 

^ The prisoner accompanied 
her down the passage to the cave 
mouth. The sunlight at the entrance 
was the most beautiful sight in the 
world. If he succeeded now, he 
need never see the orange light of 
the Sleeper’s chamber again. He fol- 
lowed her into the open air. 

In the woods, they parted with- 


out speaking. The witch expected 
him to follow his usual afternoon 
routine. He went on beside the 
stream until he was sure he was 
well away from her. 

This was it. All he had to do 
was climb up the slopes onto the 
ice. He would be free. The real 
world was very near now. 

A bird on a branch caught his 
eye. It was a dark grayish-blue 
bird with a yellow breast, and a 
bright inquisitive eye. Poor pris- 
oner. But he was different from 
the bird. He was going to escape. 

He left the stream and hurried 
through the trees to the side of 
the valley. Ten meters above him, 
the slope levelled off and the ice- 
fields began. Up there was free- 
dom. 

He did not hesitate. If she re- 
captured him, he was lost again, 
perhaps for good. He thrust one 
foot firmly on the slope. How easy 
it was! He took anpther step, and 
another. 

On the fourth upward step Ins 
foot seemed heavier. On the fifth 
it was heavier still. He faltered. 

She was trying to hold him back. 
He could feel the strain mounting 
as he struggled to lift his feet. 

He drove himself up towards the 
ice. The higher he readied, the 
more he suffered. His heart throb- 
bed like a mighty engine, and there 
was pain with every beat. He sank 
to the ground, unable to stand 
any more, but he went on crawling. 


74 


IF 



Every movement took an eter- 
nity to accomplish. His limbs had 
become monstrous, stiff and clum- 
sy, and the weight of his body 
pressed him into the ground. Inch 
by inch he dragged himself up. He 
moved through shadows, for the 
light was fading around him. Still 
he fought the invisible power bind- 
ing him to the valley. 

His upward progress was barely 
perceptible. His lungs were almost 
bursting under the pressure. Now 
the light was gone completely, and 
he strained forward in darkness. 

The blackness exploded within 
him, and he was overwhelmed. 
Red shadows whirled around him. 
His grip on the earth failed. He 
slid, and rolled downward, and 
came to rest on the grass. 

He lay still, arms outstretched. 
After a while he opened his eyes. 

The witch stood over him, her 
golden hair shining in the sun. Her 
dress was the color of night. 

She smiled, her expression mock- 
ing, and she spoke. “When you are 
ready, come back to the cave. 
Don’t be too long; we have visi- 
ters.” 

Then she was gone. He lay there, 
helpless, his body aching, his eyes 
watering. He was still a prisoner. 

X 7e 1 Senna crouched among the 
* boulders, glancing from the 
trees to the rocks and back again. 
The goddess and her companion 
had been gone for several minutes. 


Nobody else had come out of the 
cave. 

"Quickly,” whispered Krau 
Sara. "Let us go inside before they 
return.” 

They rose swiftly and bounded 
to the entrance. It was wide enough 
for them both, and the roof was 
several feet above their heads. 
Switching on their lamps, they went 
in. 

The tunnel grew smaller and 
narrower. It bore to the left, past 
a strange pillar of rock. Vel Senna 
shone his lamps on the stone col- 
umn. It took the form of a giant 
human arm, the elbow rising from 
the stone floor, the hand appar- 
ently supporting the roof. The 
workmanship was extremely crude. 

"I think it is unfinished,” said 
Krau Sara. 

“Perhaps the sculpture was 
abandoned when the ice came,” sug- 
gested Vel Senna. The opposite 
wall of the cave was blank. He 
looked around for further relics 
and noticed a faint orange glow in 
the tunnel ahead. He pointed to it. 

"Let us go nearer,” whispered 
Krau Sara. 

Past the stone arm, they had to 
go in single file, stooping to avoid 
the roof. Krau Sara led the way, 
blocking Vel Senna’s view. Then 
the tunnel opened out again, 
and they entered a large high- 
roofed chamber. An orange bulb in 
the ceiling shone brightly. 

"The jewels,” said Krau Sara. 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


77 



Gems and precious metals lay in 
confused heaps around the cham- 
ber. Vel Senna saw long rods of 
shining silver, pyramids of golden 
bars, and mounds of countless pre- 
cious stones. Some jewels were in 
mixed heaps, others had been 
sorted — emeralds in one pile, 
sapphires in another, rubies in a 
third. There was no furniture, only 
the treasure. Leaning against the 
walls were hundreds of shields and 
dishes made of gold studded with 
gems. A miniature hill in the cen- 
ter seemed to be entirely gold. 

Vel Senna picked up the nearest 
shield. The soft gold had been 
battered and deeply scored, and 
over half the chamonds were miss- 
ing from their sockets. The rest 
of the relics had received similar 
treatment. Despite this, the hoard 
was enough to put them both into 
the highest non-hereditary caste. 
The Senechi valued treasure like this 
even more highly than humans did. 

T Te saw a large sheet of gold 
A ^ nearby. It bore the shape of 
a human hand, impressed on it like 
a footprint in wet day. Vel Senna 
showed it to Kara Sara. "The metal 
must have been softened in the 
cold state for that print to be 
made.” 

"You are right,” said Krau 
Sara. "There are more prints on 
the gold discs there. They could 
only have been made with a mo- 
lecular field distorter.” 


"I know. But the selective distor- 
er is a heavy industrial machine 
weighing many tons. Do you see 
the implications?” 

"I think so.” 

"This valley is maintained by 
post-technological techniques. Here, 
at least, Earth’s old dvilization 
was ahead of us. We saw no ma- 
chines because the natives have 
passed beyond machines. Elsewhere 
they reverted to technology, but 
here they carried their antient se- 
cret s with them into the Ice Age.” 
"The theory is fandful, but you 
could be right. It explains the ab- 
sence of the heating equipment, 
which you were seeking so anx- 
iously.” 

"I am sure of it,” said Vel Sen- 
na. He indicated the orange bulb 
in the ceiling. "That lamp func- 
tions, undoubtedly, but its pur- 
pose is mainly decorative. Every- 
thing in this chamber is for pleas- 
ure.” i 

"Forget your theories,” said 
Krau Sara, eyeing the treasure 
again. "We are here for gems, not 
for sdence. We must collect a first 
installment before the natives re- 
turn. I thought you were the cau- 
tious one, not I!” 

Krau Sara, was right, of course 
Vel Senna followed his example 
and swallowed a few pounds of 
emeralds and rubies into his first 
stomach. He need not regurgitate 
the stones until he was back on the 
airship. 


78 


IF 



Gazing across the chamber, Vel 
Senna saw a peculiar structure of 
gold and silver. It resembled a na- 
tive sailing ship. There was a row 
of others like it, stretching away 
into a small tunnel entrance. As 
he looked for more, he saw a patch 
of lighter color in the central gold- 
en mound. The longer he stared, 
the stranger it seemed. Puzzled, he 
went over to look. 

The light object was a human 
head, fair-haired, facing upwards. 
The mound was a circular golden 
bed, and the head belonged to a 
human being sleeping there. 

At his call Krau Sara came over. 
He saw the sleeping man. 

"We must leave,” whispered Vel 
Senna. "He might awake.” 

"Yes,” said Krau Sara. "We must 
go at once.” 

As they turned, they saw some- 
one enter the chamber. It was the 
woman they had seen earlier, tall 
and beautiful in her black dress. 
She held up her hand. 

"You can’t go,” said the goddess. 
"I won’t let you.” 


TTTeston steered the sledge in a 
* * curve around the valley, 
the engine muted. He did not want 
the Senechi to stop him on his way 
to the pit. Explanations might be 
awkward. Despite the added weight 
of the loaded trailer, the sledge 
reached the pit in five minutes. 


"Everybody out,” said Mike. 
"Let’s have a look at it.” 

The pit was a large smooth- 
sided shaft, twenty feet in diam- 
eter, absolutely vertical, with a 
floor of rough gray stone. There 
was no snow inside it at aB. 

"That’s nice,” said Anna Holm. 
"It’s ice-free, just like the valley.” 

"The bottom’s about fifteen feet 
down,” said Weston. "It’s a bit 
far to jump. Anyway, we couldn’t 
climb out again. Those sictes have 
been polished smooth.” 

"We’ll throw a rope down,” said 
Mike. 

Weston nodded. "Sure. We can 
use some of the gear here. FH pull 
it off the trailer.” 

"Wait a minute,” said Anna. 
Weston waited. 

"Why are you two so eager to 
go down there?” 

"No harm in a quick check,” 
said Mike. 

"Seems safe enough,” added 
Weston. 

"No it doesn’t, and you know 
it. That pit obviously has some- 
thing to do with the valley. You 
didn’t dare go with the bosses, 
but you’re falling over yowselves 
to jump down there. Why change 
your minds so suddenly?” 

"I can guess John’s reason*” said 
Mike. "A way round the prohibi- 
tion?” 

"What prohibition?” asked An- 
na, pouncing. 

"It’s a long story,” said IRfeston, 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


79 



silently cursing Mike. He had no 
wish to tell Anna about the death 
of his ancestors in the valley. Still, 
he had better give her part of the 
truth. 

"We guides are forbidden to en- 
ter this valley. It’s Family law. 
Most of the other banned zones 
are radioactive. This place doesn’t 
have any radiation, but it comes on 
the same forbidden list. The valley 
is just as deadly, in its own way, 
as a ruined nuclear power station.” 
"Then why do you want to go 
down the pit?” asked Anna. 

"The list includes the valley. It 
says nothing about this pit.” 

That statement was misleading, 
but he intended it to be. Besides, 
it was true. 

"You men!” said Anna. "Hop- 
ing to get into the caves by a back 
way without breaking Family rules, 
are you? I don’t know!” 

He knew she was satisfied. She 
already had a low opinion of men 
from his country. 

W eston and Mike brought over 
the tackle from the trailer 
and set it up. The rope ladder 
dangled over the edge of the pit, 
hanging invitingly from the pay- 
ing-out board. 

"Well, here I go,” said Anna, 
hand on the rope. 

"Not so fast!” said Mike. "One 
of us is going down before you.” 
Even after years in Anna’s coun- 
try the old instincts returned. 


"I’ll go,” said Westen. "You 
stay there, Anna — the navigator’s 
more valuable than the guide.” 

"You just want the thrill of being 
first,” said Anna. 

"No, never,” said Mike. "We’re 
making sure the place is safe for 
you. Go on, John, before she makes 
a jump.” 

"When the Family try me for 
breaking regulations, at least 111 
be able to say I was first down.” 

He started descending the lad- 
der as he spoke. Seconds later he 
was standing on the rocky floor. 

"I’m down. Well, you can see that. 
Leave the ladder where it is. The 
sides are so smooth nobody could 
climb out. No holds at all.” 

"Can you see anything?” called 
Anna. 

"Something,” said Weston. He 
had found the dark opening of a 
low cave, level with the floor. 

"It’s a tunnel going into the 
rock. This is the side facing the 
valley, isn’t it?” 

Anna checked. "Yes. Your tun- 
nel must lead towards the Sleep- 
er’s cave.” 

It probably did. There was quite 
a draft in the opening. 

"I’m coming down!” called 
Anna. 

"All right,” said Weston. "Do 
you mind staying up there, Mike?” 

"No, you’re welcome. From the 
look of that gap I couldn’t squeeze 
into the cave anyway. Wrong shape. 
Say, John, tie a rope round you. 


80 


IF 



Then I can call you back if we 
get any signals from the cap’n.” 

" Right,” said Weston. Mike 
threw him one end of a lightweight 
coil, and he tied it around his 
chest. Four tugs from Mike would 
mean that he had to return at 
once. 

Anna joined him. She gave him 
a small torch. "One each.” She 
switched hers on and studied the 
opening. 

"Off we go,” said Anna. She 
slid herself into the shadow. 

"I thought I was going first,” 
said Weston. 

"You thought wrong, mate,” 
said Mike. "Hop after her before 
she vanishes.” 

Hurriedly Weston followed Anna 
into the cave. Darkness surround- 
ed him. 

«X/ou can’t go,” said the god- 
* dess. "I won’t let you.” 

Vel Senna knew there was no 
way out from the chamber. The 
goddess was standing in the en- 
trance, and the other tunnel was 
too low for Senechi to use. He and 
Krau Sara were trapped. 

"Can you understand me?” she 
asked. 

"Yes, perfectly,” he replied in 
Earth Basic. 

"Sit down,” said the goddess. 

There was no furniture in the 
cave, other than the couch with 
its sleeping occupant. Vel Senna 
knelt on the floor beside a group 


of ancient jewel-studded shields. 
The goddess sat gracefully in front 
of the Senechi. She matched the 
priest’s description of the Summer 
Goddess, but she looked like a 
normal female native. Only the gold 
circlet on her head was unusual. 

"I’ve never seen creatures like 
you before,” said the goddess. 
"What are you?” 

"We are Senechi,” said Krau 
Sara. "Surely you recognize us?” 
"No. Where do you come from?” 
Vel Senna understood then that 
the goddess had never heard of 
the Senechi, even though Earth had 
been discovered nearly two cen- 
turies ago. "Surely, even in this 
isolated northern valley you know 
about the Senechi ? ” 

"I know nothing about you. Tell 
me.” 

"We are natives of a planet 
called Del via,” said Vel Senna. He 
described how his race had discov- 
ered space travel and started col- 
onizing the planets of nearby stars. 
Earth was one such colony, with 
nearly a quarter of a million Sen- 
achi living in the equatorial re- 
gion. The goddess had no diffi- 
culty in understanding the concept 
of space travel. She had not known 
any surprise at their non-human 
bodies either. 

"What brings visitors from an- 
other world to my valley?” 

"We are searching for traces of 
the legendary pre-gladal civiliza- 
tion/’ said Vel Senna. He hoped 


THE FROZEN SUMMER

she had not seen them swallow 
the jewels. 

"We were warned to keep away,” 
added Ktau Sara. "They said a 
goddess killed everyone who came 
here. A foolish superstition. 

"Foolish?” She smiled. "You 
came here to steal my gold, didn’t 
you?” 

"We are scientists, explorers,” 
Vel Senna began. His protest was 
interrupted by the voice of a 
native. 

"You’re thieves!” 

Tt was the old man they had seen 
earlier, outside. They had not 
heard him enter the chamber. 

"She’ll kill you,” said the man. 
"She always kiMs you, whatever 
you are. You’re all thieves to her.” 

"Sit down and be quiet,” said 
the goddess. "Ignore him. He is 
mad.” 

The man sat down, running his 
fingers through his gray beard. 
His clothes and face were streak- 
ed with mud, Vel Senna noticed. 
Who was he? The priest had not 
mentioned him. 

"You Senechi, come over here,” 
said the goddess. "I’ll show you 
what I do to thieves.” 

She rose and led them across 
the chamber to the ship-like struc- 
tures. She pointed to the first. If 
had a corrugated golden hull, dec- 
orated with precious stones, and 
had five sails of thin silver sheeting. 
AH the metal shone. 


"That was Pilovitch,” said the 
bearded man. 

"Can you recognize a human 
skeleton?” asked the goddess. 

Vel Senna recognized one now. 
The hull of the ship was a human 
rib-cage. The bones were covered 
with gold foil, and the gaps be- 
tween them filled in with gold and 
jewels, but it was clearly part of a 
human skeleton. 

"I discarded the skull,” said thd 
goddess. "The arms and legs I 
used in the ship. The mainmast is 
a fibula, and the other two masts 
come from the lower arms. You 
see, this is an ulna. The remain- 
ing arm and leg bones filled this 
gap between the ribs and the pel- 
vis.” 

It was a beautiful piece of work* 
So was the next one, and the next. 
Vel Senna could see a long series 
of skeleton-ships disappearing into 
the small tunnel. None of them 
was identical in design, but the 
basic materials were obviously the 
same. Many of the ships had skulls 
in the bows or high on the masts. 

"I’ve been making these since 
my vigil began. The thieves keep; 
coming, and I always need more 
bones.” She studied the two Sen- 
echi. "I’m not sure what to do 
with you. You’re almost human 
from the waist up, but the quad- 
ruped part of you is a problem.” 

Vel Senna said nothing. He pic- 
tured the succession of jewel 
thieves who had met their deaths 


82 


IF 



in this valley. It was disturbing to 
know he would join them, so far 
from the communal dying-place of 
his home. 

"How can we escape?” asked 
Krau Sara, in Senechi. 

"I don’t know,” said Vel Sen- 
na. They looked at the skeleton- 
ships, then back at the entrance. 

"You can’t get out,” said the 
bearded man watching them. "It’s 
too late. You’ve forgotten how to 
resist here. You were in her pow- 
er from the moment she saw you.” 

UfAwl” exclaimed Anna. "That 
^ is the second time I’ve hit 
my head on the roof.” 

"Not so much noise,” whispered 
Weston. "They’ll hear you at the 
other end of the cave.” 

He and Anna were still crawling 
through the tunnel. It was slop- 
ing very slighty downwards. The 
light from their torches cast strange 
shadows on the walls as they moved 
forward. 

"It’s all right for you — you 
haven’t bumped yourself once yet.” 
"I have enough sense to keep 
my head down. Keep moving, 
Anna.” 

"I am moving! Don’t rush me. 
There, John. The cave’s opening 
out” 

About time too, he thought. If 
He went on crawling much longer 
he’d forget how to walk. 

Soon the tunnel was four feet 
high and almost as wide. Small- 


er openings appeared in the sides 
at intervals, but the main passage 
was obviously the way ahead. Af- 
ter a while Weston took the lead. 
The cave was high enough for 
him to get up off his stomach. 
Anna did the same. 

He tried to make as little noise 
as possible. There was no knowing 
where sound might carry in these 
passages. 

According to his sense of di- 
rection, the cave was heading to- 
wards the valley. The twists and 
turns did not affect its overall di- 
rection. 

Quite suddenly, he came round 
a slight bend and saw a strange 
silver and gold object shining in 
the torch-light. He stopped. 

"What is it, John? Not a dead 
end?” 

"No.” He let her move up along- 
side him. 

It was like a model of a sail- 
ing boat, made from jewels and 
precious metals. He could see oth- 
ers ahead, forming a long glitter- 
ing row against the dark stone. 
There was just enough room to 
squeeze between the line of boats 
and the opposite wall. He glanced 
over them quickly. All had squat 
golden bodies with silver sails 
above. Hundreds of gems spar- 
kled in them. 

They knelt down to examine the 
first object. It seemed unfinished, 
as if someone had put the main 
members of the hull together and 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


83 



then forgotten to fill up the gaps, 
Inside the hollow boat, partly hid- 
den in its covered bows, were sev- 
eral long golden rods with knob- 
bed ends. Weston picked up one 
of the rods, thinking it looked fa- 
miliar. He scratched the metal ex- 
perimentally. The gold leaf rum- 
pled and came curling away. 

■\T7eston unwound the gold 
* * sheet, exposing a hard 
whitish substance beneath. It took 
him a moment to realize what it 
was. Anna said it for him. 

"It’s a bone. That’s a human 
arm bone.” 

A sudden shiver ran along his 
spine. He carefully replaced the 
bone. He paused and looked hard 
at the boats. The next one had 
a strange figurehead — a human 
skulL 

He studied the first boat again. 
Now he knew what to look for, 
he could easily identify it as a 
rib-cage. The arms, legs and head 
had been removed at some time, 
leaving only the bones of the torso 
from the neck to the pelvic girdle. 
Everything in the mutilated skel- 
eton was covered with gold leaf, 
and the ribs bore clusters of dia- 
monds. 

" There must be dozens of them 
along here,” said Anna. "So this is 
where all the people disappear to.” 

"The witch does this,” said 
Weston. "It’s what you’d expect 
©f her, if you knew the old stories.” 


At that moment something jerk- 
ed around his chest. He felt a 
spasm of fear; he had forgotten the 
rope. It jerked again — four times 
in all. 

"That’s Mike’s signal,” said 
Weston. "The Senechi must have 
gone into the valleys.” 

"We can’t go back now! We’ve 
just started finding things.” 

"It’s tough, I know. The Sleep- 
er’s cave can’t be far now. But if 
we’re wanted up top we’ve got to 
go.” 

"I suppose so.” She stared at 
the golden remains again. "They’re 
horrible, but they’re fascinating.” 
"So they are.” He touched the 
diamonds on the skeleton, then 
drew back. "I hate leaving these, 
but we can come back for them 
later. Come on.” 

They started back slowly to- 
wards the surface. At the pit, Mike 
Jones was waiting for them to re- 
turn. 

T)erhaps it was his imagination, 
but Vel Senna fancied the or- 
ange glow had deepened to imi- 
tate the death-lamps of his home- 
land. 

"Why do you not kill us now?” 
he asked. 

"I don’t know how to use you,” 
said the goddess. "Your two sep- 
arate rib-cages won’t form a ship 
as they are. I don’t want to sever 
your spinal columns, but there’s 
no other way.

IF 



"Let us leave and your problem 
will be solved,” said Krau Sara. 

"You can’t leave. I’ll kill you 
tonight whether you give me an 
answer or not.” 

After that, the goddess appeared 
to lose interest in her captives. She 
sat down by a heap of rubies, put- 
ting a handful in her lap and ex- 
amining them one by one. Watch- 
ing her, Vel Senna wondered how 
many other prisoners she had held 
in this chamber. 

"Pretty, isn’t she?” said the 
bearded man. "Do you think you’ll 
escape?” 

"I do not know,” said Vel Senna. 

"She kills them all. She should 
have killed me with the rest.” 

"You will not die,” said the god- 
dess, momentarily looking up from 
her rubies. "I shall keep you 
alive.” 

"You’re the lucky ones,” said 
the man to the Senechi. "You’ll 
die soon.” 

"How long have you been a pris- 
oner here?” asked Vel Senna. 

"I can’t remember. I know I’ll 
be here until he awakes.” The man 
pointed to the sleeping form in the 
central mound. 

"Who is he?” 

The prisoner ignored Vel Senna’s 
question. "You know, he’s the 
cause of all this. If he’d never 
been born, none of this would have 
happened. Everything depends on 
that boy. When he awakes the 
valley will cease to exist.” 


How absurd , thought Vel Senna. 
I could arouse him with a single 
touch . 

Why not? He reached out for 
the Sleeper. Somehow he failed to 
touch him. He moved forward 
again, but the Sleeper was still 
the same distance away. It was 
impossible to reach the golden bed. 

"What is happening?” he asked. 

"Nothing,” said Krau Sara. 

"What do vou mean?” 

•• 

"I told you, you’re in her pow- 
er,” said the prisoner. 

Vel Senna gave up the attempt. 
"It is very strange.” 

"It is simple,” said the goddess. 
"I don’t want you to touch my 
son.” 

T Ter explanation was no expla- 
* *■* nation at all. If an invisible 
force-field had surrounded the bed, 
Vel Senna would have understood, 
but her casual disregard for logic 
and science left him bewildered. 

"Your son?” asked Krau Sara. 
"Is that sleeping human your 
child?” 

"Of course he is. Didn’t you 
know?” 

"The priest said nothing about 
him,” said Vel Senna. 

"I’d better tell you, if you don’t 
know where you are. My son and 
I came here when the long winter 
began. I’ve guarded him ever 
since.” 

"Impossible!” cried Vel Senna. 
"The last interglacial period end- 


THE FROZEN SUMMER

ed at least a thousand years ago?” 
"What?” the bearded man stood 
up, staring at the goddess. 

"It doesn't matter. It will be 
longer still before the ice melts. 
When the Ice Age comes to an end, 
my son will awake. He will go out 
into the world and rule over its 
peoples. That is his destiny.” 

"I have heard this before,” said 
Vel Senna. "It is nonsense.” 

"It is true. He will build new 
civilizations.” 

"I cannot believe it,” said Vel 
Senna. "This tale of a Sleeping 
God occurs on many planets. It 
is common among the religious be- 
liefs of primitive people.” 

"A thousand years,” said the 
bearded man. 

“Forget the legends. You are in 
my world. My son will inherit the 
Earth at the end of the ice.” 
"Will the ice ever melt?” asked 
Krau Sara. 

"It must,” said the prisoner. 
Vel Senna remembered the old 
stories he had heard from the na- 
tives. The humans had reached 
the height of their ancient civiliza- 
ton, only to see it destroyed by the 
advancing ice. All trace of that age 
had vanished, except for the Sum- 
mer Goddess and her valley. By 
her power she had held back the 
ice for a thousand years. She had 
defied the laws of the Universe 
to shape the destiny of her son. It 
was beyond reason. 

He looked at the goddess again. 


She had said the bearded prisoner 
was mad, but it must be she who 
was mad. And yet . In this 
valley Time had stopped. She 
might be insane, but that did not 
lessen her power. 

"So your son will awake and 
rule your planet,” said Krau Sara. 
"What is his name?” 
"Conqueror,” said the goddess. 

IV 

/^n the edge of the ice, Weston 
and the others gazed down 
into the valley. Nothing moved 
"This is where the Senechi were 
last seen,” said Captain Ram Ba- 
dal Zing."They vanished before we 
arrived.” 

The two female engineers had 
accompanied the captain. One of 
them said, "I saw a man walking 
out of the trees. He went into 
a cave among the rocks.” 

"Has he come out?” asked 
Weston. "No? Where’s the cave?” 
The captain pointed. •'That 
large opening just this side of the 
stream.” 

"What did the man look like?” 
"Bearded, gray hair, pale Ain, 
brown clothes,” said the woman 
who had seen him. 

"You think our bosses are in 
that cave?” asked Mike. 

"They are not in the valley,” 
said Captain Zing. 

Below them the trees were still. 
Only a few small birds could he

seen. Weston searched in vain for 
a flash of purple. 

"Any sign of the witch?” 

"No.” 

Weston paused. It would be al- 
most certain death to go after the 
Senechi. He knew now how thosei 
earlier Westons had felt, centuries 
ago, standing on this same brink. 

It had started with his ancestor 
Endes Weston, whose gang had 
crowned their previous robberies by 
stealing his own Family Shield. 
The rest could be forgiven, but not 
the Shield. The Family of Guides 
traced the gang as far as the 
valley, and here the trail ended. 
Several Westons had died before 
the quest was finally abandoned. 
Some people who only spent a few 
moments in the valley survived, but 
those who went into the cave never 
returned. 

John Weston felt responsible for 
the Senechi. He had brought them 
here. He had been mad to think 
they could find the Shield for him. 
It was his duty to save them some- 
how. He wished he had never ac- 
cepted their contract. 

He might reach the Sleeper’s 
chamber through the tunnel from 
the pit, but the Senechi could nev- 
er get out that way. The centau- 
roids were far too big for the nar- 
row tunnel. 

"We’ve got guns and grenades 
on the sledge,” said one of the en- 
gineers. "We could fight our way 
in.” 


"Don’t be stupid!” said Mike. 
"Guns agains Tihe witch?” 

"A cave is an excellent defensive 
position,” said the captain. 

W eston made no comment. 

They had no idea what an- 
cient weapons the witch might have 
in her cave. The ice had covered so 
much. 

"I know,” said Anna Holm. 
"One person could slip in and look 
around without being seen.” 
Good idea, thought Weston. It 
might just work. 

"No,” said Mike. "If there were 
guards waiting inside we’d never 
see them.” 

"I could look in with a night 
telescope. I’d see the guards then.” 
"You could?” snapped Weston. 
"Yes, why not? I’ve been in 
caves before.” 

"So have I,” said Weston, and 
his decision was made. "You’re not 
going. I am.” 

He should have gone down with 
the Senechi at the beginning. 

"That’s typical of you two. You 
keep all the exciting things for 
yourselves.” 

"It’s not exciting, Anna. It’s 
dangerous.” That woman would 
never learn. J 

Swiftly he began arming hinw] 
self with weapons from the sledgesi 
Guns for gas, projectiles, ice anc 
sonic rays. Grenades: smoke, gas 
explosive — one of them might 
work. 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


87 



Captain Zing coughed. "Mr. 
Weston, yon are under a separate 
Contract. I cannot order you not 
to go down*” 

"Then don’t,” said Weston. He 
checked his weapons. "That’s 
enough. If I break a photoelectric 
relay it’s too bad. Give me twenty 
minutes in the cave. If you don’t 
see me by then I won’t be coming 
out. Don’t come in after me.” 

He walked to the very limit of 
the ice. His feet touched the valley 
earth. 

"Good luck, Mr. Weston,” said 
Captain Zing. 

Looking up, he realized the man 
meant it. 

"John,” said Anna quickly, "how 
will you know when the twenty 
minutes are up?” 

"My watch, of course? Why?” 

"This is the valley where time 
stands still. Will your watch work 
down there?” 

He.held up his wrist. "It’s work- 
ing now.” 

"People have been in the valley 
before,” said the captain. "If the 
body rhythms continue normally, 
timepieces will not be affected.” 

"There you are,” said Weston. 
"Time hasn’t really stopped. She’s 
done something else to it.” 

It was an intriguing notion, but 
he could, not pursue it now. "See 
you later, then. Twenty minutes.” 

I t was too easy. Weston went 
down the slope, across the grass 

SS 


and into the fallen boulders, all 
without incident. Nearing the cave 
mouth, he crept forward slowly. 
He knew the others were watching 
him from the ice. 

Almost there, he had ai moment 
of doubt. What if Anna had been 
right, and time flowed differently 
in the valley? His watch seemed 
normal, but suppose a few minutes 
in the valley were equivalent to 
Several hours of outside time. 
Twenty minutes to him might 
seem like a day to the people out- 
side. Well, it was too late for him 
to worry about that now. He 
thought of those dead Westons of 
long ago. 

He drew his night telescope and 
peered into the shadows. The cave 
was empty as far as a corner. This 
was still too easy. As he walked 
in he drew his projectile gun. 

A faint glow appeared at the 
far end, growing brighter as he 
walked on. The old histories were 
true, he thought, seeing a rounded 
pillar of rock at his side. This 
could only be the Sleeper’s cave. 
Then suddenly the passage opened 
out, and he was in the chamber. 

The orange light and the Sleep- 
ers couch were as he had expected. 
Gold and jewels lay everywhere, 
astonishing him by their sheer 
quantity. The two Senechi were 
there, and the bearded man the 
engineer had seen. There, too, was 
the golden-haired witch, dressed in 
black, a legend come alive. The 

IF 



dead Westons were very close to 
him now. 

Whipping up his projectile gun, 
he squeezed off a quick burst of 
bullets. They had no effect. He 
fired the whole clip, but she was 
unharmed. Somehow he was not 
surprised. 

He had other weapons. He 
snatched up a two-second smoke 
grenade, thumbed it and flung it 
at her. The bearded man jumped 
up towards the witch, and then the 
white smoke enveloped them both. 

TTigh up near the roof, some- 

** thing dark and shapeless 
floated towards him. It touched 
the smoke and withered away. 

Shaken by the sight of that dark 
presence, he set off two more gre- 
nades. As they burst, he saw the 
bearded man go flying backwards 
to crash against the wall. Simulta- 
neously, waves of dizziness washed 
through his brain. The Senechi 
were standing at the fringe of the 
smoke clouds, unmoving. 

"Run, you idiots!” he cried. "Get 
out.” 

They remained like statues, and 
the smoke covered them. The diz- 
ziness pulsed through him, strong- 
er and stronger. Tiny blue electric 
discharges appeared in the smoke; 
he heard them crackling. The blue 
sparks flashed towards him and 
stung wherever they hit him. His 
head was throbbing under enor- 
mous blows. 


The witch appeared from the 
clouds. He fired his sonic gun, but 
a giant blue flash jerked it from 
his hand. The gun hit the floor 
and exploded. 

Both he and the witch were 
hurled to the ground by the blast. 
He had not the strength to rise. He 
thought foolishly that it was a fee- 
ble explosion. Recovering his wits 
despite the constant pounding in 
his brain, he drew his ice gun. 
Blue sparks from the smoke still 
jolted him, but the gun stayed 
put as he fired. 

A stream of rectification impulses 
hissed towards her, freezing every- 
thing in their path. Snowflakes 
whirled out of the beam, but the 
witch was untouched. 

Sparkling diamonds showered 
upon them. Weston glimpsed the 
bearded man through the smoke, 
casting jewels into the air. The 
gun crumbled away in his hand, 
but he hardly noticed. He was al- 
most beaten. 

"It’s time you stopped this,” 
said the witch, getting to her feet. 
Sapphires descended from thg 
smoke. j 

"A thousand years!” cried tifi| 
bearded man. "Curse you, daug^l* 
ter!” | 

Suddenly the jewels were glom 
ing. Inner fires flared up with&f 
the crystals, flashing out bright* 
ly. Some of them struck Weston^ 
burning him. All around him th^ 
jewels were heating up, shining 


THE FROZEN SUMMER

like colored searchlights through 
the thinning smoke. And the Sene- 
chi were screaming. 

Then the light was cut off, and 
everything disappeared. All thei 
noises ceased, even the thunder of 
his pulse. His mind became quiet 
and peaceful in the darkness. 

All resistance ended, and he let 
the witch possess him. 

T7el Senna watched the battle 

* between their guide and the 
goddess without emotion. The na- 
tive could not kill her. He was 
fighting bravely, but his efforts 
were in vain. The goddess would 
soon subdue hm. 

Smoke swirled around the Sene- 
chi, and Vel Senna saw tiny blue 
sparks crackling in the clouds. Ob- 
viously the goddess was using a 
localized field distorter, although 
he could not see the instrument. 

The bearded prisoner flung 
handsful of jewels into the smoke 
He cried out, "Curse you, daugh- 
ter!” 

Her face became terrible. Vel 
Senna screamed. 

Fire burst out within him. The 
gems in his stomach were burn- 
ing! He coughed in desperation, 
and with terrible slowness the 
stones came up. A stream of glow- 
ing emeralds and rubies spouted 
from his mouth. 

He had to get out! Suddenly his 
mind was free. The goddess had 
lost control. 


"This way!” he cried. "Follow 
me!” 

Krau Sara was with him. They 
raced out of the chamber gallop- 
ing madly along the tunnel. Sun- 
light struck them like a blow. 

He saw natives above the val- 
ley. Their crew! The two giant 
centauroids hurtled across the 
ground. 

Safety was but a few yards 
away. Vel Senna put every possi- 
ble effort into leaping up the 
slope. His hooves hit ice. They were 
out. 

"We have escaped!” he shouted 
sending the natives reeling back 
in alarm. He clasped Krau Sara. 
; Their flight had taken mere sec- 
onds, so swiftly had they moved. 

He looked with new vision at the 
ice on which he stood. That froz- 
en white water was more precious 
than any colored crystals he could 
possess. It meant he was free of 
the goddess and her eternal sum- 
mer. He was back in the Ice Age. 

/^ne of the natives stepped for- 
^ ward. It was the dark-skin- 
ned captain, Ram Badal Zing. He 
asked, "Sir, what happened in the 
cave? Where is Mr. Weston?” 

The guide was probably dead by 
now. He could not win against the 
goddess. In fact, the sooner, the 
Senechi left the area the better. It 
was too dangerous to stay here. 

"Where is Mr. Weston?” the 
captain repeated. 


90 


TF 



"He has served his purpose,” 
said Ve! Senna. "We ‘will return to 
the airship at once.” 

“What happened to him?” 

These natives were infuriating- 
ly persistent. “He was fighting the 
goddess when we escaped. He is 
now dead or a prisoner.” 

“We can’t just leave him,” said 
the chief engineer, Jones. 

"You must. The goddess can in- 
fluence your minds to make escape 
psychologically impossible. She 
may be affecting you now. We 
jnust not remain here. Get aboard 
the sledges. We shall hire a new 
guide at the next town.” 

"No,” said the captain. 

Vel Senna boarded the nearest 
sledge, Krau Sara following. "Cap- 
tain Zing, I order you to drive 
back to the ship.” 

"Mr. Weston is still in the cave.” 
Vel Senna and the captain stared 
grimly at each other. 

Jones broke the silence, "I’ll 
drive them back, cap’n. The rest 
of you stay here and look for John. 
We’ll wait for you.” 

The engineer swung himself in- 
to the pilot seat. “I’ll have you 
back in a few moments, sir.” 

The possibilities were good, 
thought Vel Senna. Hastily count- 
ing the natives here, he calculated 
there were two crew members at 
the airship — plus Jones. That was 
enough to fly to the nearest town, 
and then they could pick up a 
fresh crew. 

THE FROZEN SUMMER 


“Drive off,” said Jones, kicking 
on the engine. He cut in the fly- 
wheel, and the sledge moved off. 

That was the last they would see 
of those natives. It was annoying, 
because good crews were hard to 
find and also extremely expensive. 
But it was worth it to escape that 
terrible valley. 

'T'he journey to the airship was 
over in minutes. Jones halted 
the sledge in the shadow of the 
gasbag, right under the davits. Vel 
Senna gained the lower deck in a 
single leap. 

“Secure the sledge,” said Vd Sen- 
na to the two humans aboard. They 
attached the hooks and inched the 
sledge up into its flight position. 

“Jones, come with us to the con- 
trol room,” said Vd Senna. 

"Yes, sir.” The engineer followed 
the two Senechi along the passage- 
way. 

In the control room Vel Senna 
felt more relaxed. Soon he would be 
far away from the goddess. He 
pointed to the instruments. “Lift 
ship, Jonos.” 

The engineer frowned. “What — 
take off, sir?” 

“Yes, human. Take off.” 

“Well, sir, if you put it tike that 
. ” The native went up to the 
controls. Clearly he was better con- 
ditioned to obedience than the oth- 
ers. 

At the controls Jones readied in- 
to a pocket. Out came a heat gun. 

fi 



He fired into the panels. He did it 
so casually that Vel Senna stood 
there and watched him do it. 

Under toe hissing beam whole 
banks of instruments melted away. 
The steering columns collapsed in- 
wards. Vapor rose up from the 
wreckage, and drops of liquefied 
metal spattered on the floor. There 
was a bang as the fuses blew. 

“Well, there’s a thing,” said 
Jones, as the last controls dissolved. 
He stopped firing and shook his 
head. 

“I don’t know what came over 
me. I’ll start the repairs right 
away.” 

V el Senna drew his whip. “Hu- 
man, you have immobilized 
this airship.” 

"Clever of you to notice.” Al- 
most by accident, the gun was now 
pointing towards the Senechi. 
"Just by the way, I’m the only 
one on board who can repair these 
controls. Unless you want to go 
back to the valley for my assis- 
tants you’d better leave me com- 
pletely alone.” 

"The other two here — ” 
"They cannot help,” said Krau 
Sara. "They are unskilled domes- 
tics.” 

"Quite true,” said Jones. "Mai- 
sie’s a good cook but she’s a hope- 
less engineer. Well, I’ll pick up 
something to start patching up this 
mess. I might have some part 
trouble because of the changeover 

92 


to Senechi calibration. Still, it’s 
not as bad as it looks. I should 
rig up something by nightfall .’ 9 
He strolled out. His footsteps re- 
ceded along the passageway to toe 
equipment stores. 

Vel Senna let his whip fall. "I 
shall definitely kill that human to- 
morrow.” 

"Why not now?” suggested 
Krau Sara. We could ride a sledge 
back to civilization.” 

"No, we need him,” said Vd 
Senna. "If we do not return with 
this airship there will be an in- 
quiry by the Native Relations 
Board. We cannot stand another in- 
vestigation.” 

"So Jones has the advantage?” 

"Yes, and he knows it. The na- 
tives back at the valley are arm- 
ed. If we kill Jones and leave, they 
will pursure us — on sledges or in 
the airship.” 

"Can we kill him now? His sub- 
ordinates will do the work.” 

"We would have to return to the 
valley. They might search for the 
guide until sunset, and then we 
would have to spend the night 
here. I do not wish to face toe 
goddess in darkness.” 

"Neither do I.” 

"So now we must wait for 
Jones.” 

"He’s the second native today 
who has trapped us.” 

"Yes,” said Vel Senna, with 
rare bitterness. "I shall not for- 
get this day.”

'T'he prisoner touched a sapphire 
hesitantly. It was quite cold 
again. Around him, the smoke was 
drifting away as the chamber re- 
toned to normal. On the ground 
lay the fur-clad warrior, still and 
quiet in defeat. His weapons had 
disappeared. The prisoner re- 
membered other warriors coming to 
the cave, all had met the same 
end. 

He had tried to help the stran- 
ger, but the end had been inevi- 
table. 

His one consolation was the 
escape of the purple monsters. Only 
three people had ever escaped be- 
fore, and two of them had later re- 
turned and died. The struggle to 
free the aliens had been worth- 
while. The battle had been hard; 
jewels were scattered everywhere, 
and the bursting grenades had 
printed white smears over the floor. 
His hands were still raw where 
his daughter’s fury had turned the 
jewels to fire as he held them. He 
was amazed that the stranger had 
fought on for so long. 

His daughter stood over the war- 
rior, calm and in control once more. 
She was not ready to kill the man 
yet 

“Get up,” she said. “What is 
your name?” 

The stranger obeyed slowly. "Pm 
Jehn Weston,” he said. He looked 
around and saw the skeleton-ships. 


Clearly he recognized than. 

Watching him, the prisoner real- 
ized that tins man Weston had 
known from the beginning what Ins 
fate would be. Then the stranger 
saw him. 

“I remember you,” said the 
stranger, “you and the jewels. 
You called her daughter. Are you 
her father?” 

“I am, God help me.” 

“What is God?” 

A thousand years, thought the 
prisoner. 

“My father is no better than 
you,” said the witch. “He was the 
first to come after my treasure. Do 
you know why I keep him aKve? 
To show my son that his ancestors 
were peasants and thieves. He is 
the past that Conqueror will de- 
stroy.” 

He was completely in his daugh- 
ter’s power. It was his punishment 
for bringing her into the world. 

“Do you hate your father that 
much?” asked Weston. 

“No,” she replied. “He is weak. 
They were all weak.” 

The prisoner saw Weston look 
towards the row of gleaming skel- 
eton-ships. 

“You will be one soon.” 

“I thought so. I’ve seen them 
before.” 

“You have actually seen them?” 
asked the witch. “Where?” 

“In the cave.” 

“From the air shaft? How did 
you get out?” 


THE FROZEN SUMMER 


93 



'T'he prisoner was as surprised as 
^ as his daughter. He had often 
crawled along the dark tunnel to 
the pit, but Ms daughter had al- 
ways prevented him from climbing 
out. Other captives had tried it 
before she killed them, and all had 
failed. 

"We turned round and went back 
the same way we came.” said 
Weston. 

"We? You were not alone?” 
"Anna was with me.” 

"What made you turn round?” 
“Mike’s signal. I had one end of 
the rope. He stayed outside, and 
when he tugged it I knew we had 
to go back.” 

"External stimulus,” said the 
witch. "How simple, how ingeni- 
ous. I shall prevent it in future.” 
That explained it, thought the 
prisoner. Anyone entering the air 
shaft was lured further in by sub- 
tle mental suggestions. The signal 
called Weston back before her au- 
tomatic conditioning had taken 
full effect. Perhaps the idea was 
common, for they had had fewer 
visitors of late, it seemed. 

Ropes! Weston was not alone. 
There were other men outside with 
ropes. Perhaps they were still there, 
thought the prisoner. If he went 
up to the pit they might be able 
to ptdl him out. 

The prisoner quickly formed a 
new plan. When his daughter was 
fully occupied with Weston he 
would leave the chamber for thel 


air shaft. If the men were there 
they would help him escape. It 
was his final chance. 

"You made a very determined 
assault on me,” his daughter was 
saying to Weston. "You resisted 
me for several minutes. What kept 
you going?” 

"I don’t know.” 

Good. She was busy probing 
Weston’s motives for the attack. 
Presently he would slip away to 
the shaft. The purple aliens would 
want to rescue Weston, and they 
would surely have men stationed 
up there. 

It was hard for him to remem- 
ber, but these periods of sanity 
lasted for about a day. He would 
have ample time to escape. 

"I feel guilty about bringing 
them here,” said Weston. "I was 
hoping all along they’d go inside.” 
"Why was this?” she asked. 

"I hoped they might find our 
Family Shield.” 

There were many shields in the 
cave, mostly dating from before 
the Ice Age. It was possible that 
some of them had belonged to the 
Families, but it did not matter to 
the prisoner. He had lost interest 
in shields long ago. Only one thing 
mattered to him now. 

"I see it now,” said the witch

We still use the same design 

Now, thought the prisoner, go 
now while she’s still interested in 
him. 

While they were talking, the 
prisoner stole away silently past 
the skeleton-ships. The tunnel led 
to his private corner — and to the 
air shaft. 

They had not seen him go. He 
could still hear their voices as he 
hurried along the dark passage. 

tt'T'his is the one,” said the 
* witch. 

Weston looked at the shield she 
was holding. It was old and bat- 
tered, with many empty jewel 
sockets, but he knew the design. 
It was the ancient device of his 
Family. 

"Yes. It’s our Family Shield.” 

"A man called Endes Weston 
brought it here. He had already 
stolen this from his Family, and 
he came here to steal more.” 

Other shields lay about the 
chamber. Most of them were in 
bad condition, but Weston saw 
one standing by the Sleeper’s bed 
which was perfect. 

"So the blood of Endes Weston 
still flows. You came here with 
your purple friends to steal back 
your Shield. Your greed and your 
guilt were combined — as in my 
other Westons.” 

He did not want to die, but he 
saw no way to prevent it. She 
had taken away his will to resist. 


Endes Weston must have gone 
through this same torture three 
hundred years ago. 

"Did you turn my ancestor’s 
bones into a boat?” 

"Yes, I use you all. Perhaps I 
shall put you beside him.” 

The witch suddenly looked up 
towards the entrance. She had seen 
something. Weston turned. 

In the chamber stood another 
woman, also a blonde, but dressed 
in furs. "Hello there,” she said. 

Anna Holm! 

It was impossible. He had told 
them not to follow him. But it 
would have to be Anna, who dis- 
obeyed him. Calmly she was walk- 
ing to them. 

"Have you come to die too?” 
asked the witch. 

"Oh no,” said Anna. "I’ve ceme 
to give you something.” 

Weston could only stave at her. 

She put her hand into a pocket 
and brought something out. It was 
a small watch. Its ticking was loud 
in the quiet cave. 

Anna offered it to the witch. 
"It’s for you. A present from me. 
Look, it teHs you the time.” 

Time. The watch was ticking 
away, in a place where time had 
been forgotten. His own watch had 
vanished with his weapons. Now 
here was another. 

"Put it away,” said the witch, 
drawing back. 

"No, take it,” said Anna. "It’s 
yours. You like treasure. The cas-

ing’s made of solid gold. Don’t you 
want R?” 

Tick, tick. Tick, tock. The 
witch’s eyes were fixed on the 
moving hands. Seconds passed with 
no other sound. 

Gold isn’t any use to me,” said 
Anna. "You can have it, really.” 
"No,” said the witch. "Stop tor- 
menting me!” 

"If you don’t want it, just pick 
it up and smash it. I won’t mind.” 
“I cannot touch your gift. The 
sight and sound of it are terrible. 
You have made Time move before 
me.” 

"What’s wrong with that?” 

"I make Time stand still.” 

"I had an idea you did.” 

nphe second hand went on round 
and round, marking off the 
numbers without pause. The witch 
looked away. 

"Very well. Go from here, and 
take your watch away.” 

"And John?” 

"Take your man as well.” 
Anna caught hold of him. "You 
heard. Come on!” 

He was bewildered. "Yes, but 
— ” He pointed to the Weston 
Family Shield. 

Weston hesitated, unable to de- 
cide. 

"Don’t!” cried Anna, jerking at 
his wrist. "Don’t spoil everything 
now! ” 

Anna. Trust Anna. Weston al- 
lowed himself to be led away. As 


he went, he felt the mists inside 
his head suddenly disappear. 

"Don’t look back,” said Anna. 
"This way.” 

"I know,” said Weston. "I’m 
clear again.” 

“Remember,” called the witch, 
“my son shall conquer you all!” 

“Come on ” said Anna. “Back 
to the others!” 

They went running out of the 
chamber, away from the orange 
light and into the darkness of 
the tunnel. Weston had a vision of 
ice, stretching away in endless 
wastes across half the world. He 
ran towards the ice. The pale light 
of the entrance expanded before 
him, and suddenly he was out of 
the cave and in the valley. It was 
wonderful to have open air around 
him again. 

They struggled across the rocky 
ground to the slope. Anna stumbled 
on a loose stone; Weston held her 
firmly. 

"I’m all right. You can let go 
of me now.” 

"Not yet. You’re the only real 
thing in the valley.” 

Together he and Anna scram- 
bled up the slope. He saw the 
captain and the engineers waiting 
on the skyline. They looked reas- 
suringly solid. They reached down 
and helped the two of them up 
onto the ice. 

Ice, firm and hard, outside the 
witch’s domain. Weston stamped 
on it, feeling it crunch underneath

IF 



his heel. "Ice,” he said "Nothing 
to beat it.” 

"Look,” said the captain. 

Down in the valley, the witch 
had come out of the cave. She 
stood looking up at the little group 
of people. 

Weston found Anna’s hand 
again. "This is where we get out 
for good. I’m not staying here any 
longer.” 

"An extremely sensible point of 
view,” said Captain Zing. He nod- 
ded to the engineers. " Right, 
aboard the sledge. Back to the 
ship.” 

The witch was still gazing at 
them as they sped away. Her face 
was full of hate. 

Tt was bitterly cold at the bot- 
**■ tom of the pit. The prisoner 
sat against the smooth wall, his 
eyes closed, his breathing slow. 
Five meters above him was the 
ice, a circle of blue sky, and noth- 
ing else. 

He did not return to the tunnel. 
His period of sanity was not over 
yet, and while it lasted he in- 
tended to wait in case the men 
came back. They were his only 
hope of escape. A thousand years 
in this valley, he thought, pulling 
his clothing tighter against the 
cold. No man could have remained 
sane throughout such a captivity. 
The wonder was that the mad- 
ness ever faded at all. 

It was an eternity later that the 


prisoner heard the engine. He stood 
up as the sound of the motor grew 
louder. The men had returned 1 
He listened intently as the noise 
gave a final roar and died away. 
Voices came down to him. 

"Stand back!” It was a man 
speaking and one accustomed to 
authority. "The witch may have 
laid a trap since you were here 
last.” 

"I’m not worried about her,” 
said a woman. "I just hope the 
Senechi don’t fly off before we 
get back.” 

"You leave that to Mike,” said 
another man. "You saw what he 
did to those controls.” 

The prisoner recognized the last 
voice. It was Weston! The man 
had escaped. Something had hap- 
pened in the Sleeper’s chamber 
after he left. 

"Now,” said Weston, I’m going to 
the edge. Give me five seconds 
and then pull me back whatever 
happens. No, make that three sec- 
onds. Ready?” 

Suddenly Weston came into 
view, staring down at the prisoner 
from the ice high above. 

"Help me!” cried the prisoner. 
"Get me away from here!” 

"Stay there!” Weston shouted, 
and disappeared. 

Rescue. In a few moments he 
would be free. He heard Weston 
speaking to the others. "Yes, it’s 
the man from the cave. He’s 
there.” 


THE FROZEN SUMMER

"I told you be would be,” said 
the woman. "This is the only 
place be could have come.” 

"He was lucky you thought of 
it,” said Weston. "I didn’t see him 
leave the chamber. Ah I Thanks. 
Fire away.” 

The prisoner heard a series of 
ringing metallic blows, seven or 
eight in all. Wbat were they do- 
ing up there? The noise might at- 
tract his daughter. 

Weston reappeared, accompanied 
by several other people. 

/^\ne of the men flung a rope 
^ ladder. It hung quivering in 
front of the prisoner, inviting him 
to take hold of if. He could see 
every strand of the rough fibers. 
Hesitantly he touched it. 

The men shouted at him to 
climb up it. 

He put his foot on the first rung 
and began to climb. He moved very 
slowly, hardly daring to breathe 
in his tension. On the third step 
he felt the old familiar heaviness 
flowing into his limbs. He knew 
that her power was still strong. 

After six steps he paused, his 
breathing labored, and he found he 
could not rise again. The ropes 
were taut and stretching under the 
weight of his distorted body. They 
would break soon. He knew the 
men watching him, uncomprehend- 
ing. He hung there on the ladder, 
not moving, until the ropes parted. 
He dropped back into the pit. 


He lay on the floor, looking up- 
wards at the puzzled faces. They 
threw him another ladder and 
urged him to try again, but he 
shook his head wearily. He would 

never be able to reach the surface 

/ 

while his daughter possessed him. 

One of the men shifted his feet, 
dislodging a piece of snow. The 
lump came falling into the pit, but 
it melted away in the air. The 
prisoner saw it vanish. 

He had to face the truth. His 
daughter’s power never lessened. 

This had all happened before, 
again and again. He had lain here 
jin previous centuries, seeing the 
anxious people above, knowing 
their efforts were useless. Now he 
remembered why Weston’s face 
was familiar in these surroundings. 
Endes Weston had stood up there, 
three centuries before. And how 
many others had tried to rescue 
him from the pit? All of them had 
failed. He was fated to remain 
here until the Sleeper arose. 

He was trapped in this fragment 
of a forgotten summer, beyond the 
help of any man. Bitterly he called 
out to them to go away, and pres- 
ently they did. Their engine start- 
ed up, fading gradually into the 
distance until he could no longer 
hear it. He was left alone. 

It always ended like this. He 
was no better than the birds in 
the trees, singing the same songs. 

Only the people outside were 
free. END

THE FAITHFUL MESSENGER 

by GEORGE SCITHERS 


The message was urgent! The fate 
of empires rested on it — and it 
was 7 4,000,000 years too late! 


A lonely wind whispered across 
the dead city’s harbor, carry- 
ing with it a wisp of dust from the 
dry sea bottom. Jon followed the 
swirl of dust with his eyes, saw it 
eddy around the rounded, time- 
smoothed stones of the crumbled 
ruins, then drift to the ground as 
the tired wind died. The Scout 
looked up; though the local sun 
stood high, the sky was almost 
black, and he could make out De- 
neb. Sol, he knew, was just a few 
degrees to one side, but too far — 
much too far — to be seen from 
here, even through this thin, dry 
atmosphere. 

“Quiet place, isn’t it?” asked 
Jon’s partner, tall Rolf. 

“Yeah, we’re the most excitement 


the planet’s had since the ocean 
boiled away.” 

“Well, you aren’t going to have 
much excitement to match a low- 
grade nova — I suppose that’s what 
it was. Still — ” 

Shrill bells sounded. The two 
men jumped, then ran for their 
Scoutcraft, a few hundred meters 
away in the ruins. As they ran, Jon 
touched his radio, yelled, “I hear 
ya; alarm acknowledged! What’n 
space is it?” 

“Aerial craft approaching, non- 
Terran, non-Federation.” The 
Scoutcraft’s computer shifted from 
its flash-message to its emergency 
tone of voice, continued: “Bearing

"Digital signals — establishing a

— series of prime numbers — shall I 
attempt to open communication? ” 
“Yes!” said Jon. He slapped his 
radio, said “Yes! ” again. 

“Unknown is apparently com- 
puter-directed,” the Scoutcraft 
computer went on in its priority- 
message tone of voice. “Program- 
ming includes a Ianguage-leaming- 
and-translation program of Extra- 
ordinary adaptability.” 

“Where’n space the thing come 
from?” panted Jon, remembering to 
turn on his radio this time. He 
bounded over a crumbled wall, slid 
to a stop at the Scoutship’s side. 
“I thought you said there wasn’t 
anything radiating on the whole 
planet before we landed.” 

“The unknown was not on planet 
then,” said the computer. “Fascin- 


ating ffahdatfcm ft

“You mean, It and us found this 
planet at exactly the same time? 
That’s — that — ” Rolf fell silent, 
looked up and pointed. “There it 
Is!” 

A spot in the sky quickly grew, 
resolved Itself into an oblong, tar- 
nished spacecraft some ten meters 
long that settled almost to the 
ground some distance from the two 
Scouts and their ship. The unknown 
floated slowly, silently toward them 
and stopped, still floating, a dozen 
meters away. 

Jon took a step into his Scout- 
craft’s airlock, hesitated, then 
stepped back out, staring. The un- 
known looked like nothing he had 
ever seen before — too small {o be 
a manned spaceship, too big to be 
a bomb, too featureless to be an 
exploratory probe and definitely not 
a Federation device of any kind. 
Not that there would have been an- 
other Federation device bn this 
planet of Deneb, countless light- 
years from Earth. 

A new voice cut through the thin 
air. 

The unknown asked: “As thb 
Representatives of the Minister of 
Messages of the Government of 
Therin 12, will you accept — ” 

“What in space do you mean?” 
asked Jon. 

“And who or what are you?”

paused, then added, “I am on the 
Realm’s business.” 

"But — but — what happened 
here?” said Rolf, gesturing at the 
sere landscape, at the dusty ruin 
of the dead city. 

"Are you sure you aren’t off

“Way off course?” asked Rolf. 
"I’ve never heard of the Realm.” 
"Incredible,” muttered the oblong 
messagecraft. "You are in the very 
midst of the Realm. Still, it has 
been a long time — ” 

"How long? And what in space 
happened here?” 

“I am not authorized to make

relevant information,” said the mes- 
sagecraft, apologetically. "Now:

are only intelligent beings inhabit- 
ing thereon, correct?” 

"Yes, but — ” said Rolf. 
"Therefore, you constitute the 
Government of Therin 12 and 
hence, you necessarily encompass 
the office of Minister of Messages 
as well. Wherefrom it follows logic- 
ally that you are authorized to 
accept messages. Now — ”

“The messages have been too long

"Well — ” 

"As the Government of Therifij

yourselves to receive official mes- 
sages. WiU you accept the mess- 
ages?” 

"Okay, but — ” 

"I have,” said the messagecraft, 
"just now transmitted my messages 
to your ship’s computer.” , 

"Printout of the data ready,” said 
the Scoutcraft computer, via radio. 
Jon scrambled aboard, found a five- 
centimeter stack of paper stacked 
under the ship’s printer. 

"I would,” said the tarnished

from his ship with an armload of 
message text, "have given you my

stand from your ship’s computed

Jon handed Rolf half the stack 
of freshly printed paper, then be- 
gan to read the top page himself.

A Ierted by their watchmen, who 
** were mostly Seminoles, the Red- 
Necked Ofays of the Okefinokee 
Reservation came hurtling out of 
their soggy holes and nests with 
such yiolence that the alligators 
and water moccasins went hurtling 
back into theirs. Reptiles can take 
only so much excitement. 

With hoarse cackles of happiness, 
the emaciated whites and their Red 
Indian fellow-reservationists floun- 
dered about snatching at the 
little transparent packets of hom- 
iny grits, chitterings, and moon- 
shine originally intended for the 
poor Black trash of Appalachia, but 
MOW miraculously diverted and 
falling like manna from the sweaty 
southern sky. 


Along with the hillbilly ambrosia 
and nectar, a faint cry haunting as 
the flight of the flamingo lingered 
in those same dismal hot heavens: 
“Compliments of the Endfray of the 
Ofay I” 

The Red-Necked Ofays paused in 
their snatching to lift a ragged 
cheer. 

This was not the first exploit of 
the mysterious marauder who bad 
thus far left no due to his identity 
except a cry from the sky. Most 
folks now attributed to him the 
signs, “Whitey lives 1” which a 
month ago hid begun to appear 
scrawled big in shiversomely daring 
spots, such as the front wall of 
the Black House in Memphis. Then 
a week ago a boisterous party of

Luxor Blacks on a sweep-and-annoy 
Excursion through the Bayous Res- 
ervation had had their persons and 
swamp buggies deluged with Yazoo 
mud "Courtesy of the Endfray of 
the Ofay I” Many intellectual and 
fashionable Blades had secretly 
approved this literally dirty trick, 
since the chivvying and terrorizing 
of helpless Ofays was beginning to 
be considered uncouth behavior. 
Then only yesterday a 17 -year-old 
white concubine of the Caliph of 
Harlem had been kidnapped by 
the Endfray and levitated back to 
her tribe in the Great Barrens 
Reservation. Reactionary and mor- 
alistic Blacks, long detesting the 
Caliph for his contempt of the 
strict rules against miscegenation, 
had openly praised the act. In fact, 
only the rescued and windblown 
white girl had been completely un- 
happy about the whole business. 
But no Blacks could be expected 
to approve the food drop, which not 
only upset the national economy, 
but also violated the even stricter 
laws against interfering, by helping 
the weak, with the divine principle 
of survival of the fittest. 

The Black wardens of the Oke- 
finokee melted with their furious 
and frightened messages the wires 
to Memphis, Cairo, Thebes, Luxor 
(once Vicksburg and Natchez) and 
the other great Government cities 
of the American Nile.

Kamak had scrambled and another 
was screaming down through the 
stratosphere. 

A t Her palatial HQ in Memphis, 
Her Serene Darkness noted the 
disturbance and ordered that sam- 
ples of the food packets be re- 
covered and rushed to her. She did 
not, nevertheless, shift one black 
iota of her essential concentration 
off the great war that was being 
fought between North America and 
Africa to Make the World Safe for 
Black Supremacy, by determining 
which Blacks really were supreme. 

Ten seconds more and all three 
squadrons of Black Angels were re- 
versing course west as* quickly as 
their already great velocity would 
permit, and then shifting into over- 
drive. 

Word had come that there had 
Been another drop of mysteriously 
diverted viands — this time on the 
Death Valley Reservation of the 
Bearded and Beaded Ofays. 

Once again there had come that 
weird cry from the sky: "Compli- 
ments of the Endfray of the Ofay I ” 

Along with the packets of fruit 
and saffron-tinted, precooked rice

land vegetables, there were falling 
foam - packaged Tibetan prayer 
wheels, smuggled no man might say 
how through the Nirvana Screen. 

The starving descendants of 
ancient hippies, beats, culdsts and 
movie moguls had come boiling up 
out of the furnace-hot mouths of 
their caves and holes. Even outside 
the reservations, holes were a pop- 
ular residence in those exciting 
times when Black atom bombs were 
in the air and when all mankind 
was preoccupied, to a degree at 
least equal to his interest in space, 
with Earth’s molten, slow-churning 
mantle, rich in mohole-minable 
radioactivies and also a source of 
strange and mighty powers when 
properly tickled by CDEF (Cole- 
man - Dufresne Electrogravitomag- 
netic Fields) or by magic spells. 
For in the new world sorcery and 
sdence walked arm in arm, some- 
times so closely that none might 
tell which was which, or who was 
holding the other up. And the 
density iand darkness of Earth’s in- 
terior suited the Black Age. Russia, 
which ever since Dostoyevsky Day 
had shifted her fundamentally in- 
trospective and peasant interests 
from the sky to the East European 
plains and Siberian steppes, had 
used CDEF (and possibly some 
Tungu chants) to carry by slow 
convection and concentrate vast sub- 
critical masses of fissionable radio- 
actives underneath all the world’s 
continents. Increased CDEF tick- 


ling would produce unimaginably 
destructive earthquakes — the so- 
called mantle bombs that were 
USSR’s doomsday answer to a gg 
sion. Africa and North America 


utilized the same methods to en- 
rich the radioactives they took from 
their mohole mines. Australia had 
employed CDEF and bone-pointing 
Aboriginal magic to accelerate con- 
tinental drift, so that the great 
down-under island, shoving Tas- 
mania before it, was now separated 
from Antarctica by only a narrow 
strait. Australia enjoyed a Canadian 
climate and was hemmed by ex- 
tremely rich fisheries. While the 
great Buddhist hegemony of Sino- 
India had used CDEF (possibly) 
and yoga and zen (certainly) to 
create the Nirvana Screen. 

In response to the echoing cry 
from the dry sky, the Beaded and 
Bearded Ofays touched fingertips 
to foreheads and briefly meditated 
their gratitude. 

In the fringes of her awareness, 
Her Serene Darkness noted this 
food-drop also, and she gave the 
same order. 

Over the Pacific, a tiny West- 
ward - speeding vehicle reversed 
course instantaneously, and so of 
course without circling, to return 
momentarily to a point over Death 
Valley and shout down, “The End- 
fray thanks you for your prayers.” 

The Ofays below rejoiced, while 
by the psionic grapevine that tenu- 
ously links unfortunates, a little 


ENDFRAY OF THE OFAY

hope was kindled in the Swarthy 
Ofays of the Chihuahua Reserva- 
tion, the Stunted Ofays of the 
Jersey Flats, the Giant Ofays of the 
Panhandle Reservation, the Long- 
Haired Ofays of the Tules, and even 
in the Wild or Unfenced Honkies 
of the Rocky Mountains, the Black 
Hills, and the Badlands. 

[The Endfray’s linear loop wasted 
enough time to let the Black Angels 
zero in on him, her, it or them, with 
their radars and telescopes. With 
hardly a millisecond’s delay, they 
aimed and activated their deadly 
lasers, rocket bombs and constric- 
tion fields. 

Ophe Endfray went zigzagging 
**■ west again just in time. His 
evasive tactics were masterly. He 
seemed able to anticipate each move 
of his pursuers. Mini-atomics burst 
info searing violet spheres about 
him, red laser-needles lanced past 
him, space itself was squeezed and 
wrenched, but he bobbed along un- 
harmed like a Ping-pong ball in a 
tornado. 

For an instant one Black Angel 
telescoped him clearly. The fleeing 
vehicle was incredibly tiny, the size 
and shape of a chunky dwarf’s 
spacesuit, snow white in hue, and 
across it went the red letters “End- 
fray of the Ofay.” There were no 
jefs or antennae. It flashed out of 
sight perhaps a microsecond before 
a laser pierced the space it had 
occupied. 


Yet despite or perhaps because 
of the Endfray’s ingenious doub- 
lings and dartings, the Black Angels 
were gaining on him. He veered 
south, but Australia sent up a line 
of warning star rockets. He veered 
north, but when he neared the 
moored, melancholy black balloons 
marking the Russian border, they 
moaned, “Nyet, nyet,” at him and 
he once more reversed course and 
sought the Equator. 

The blue of the sky ahead be- 
came grainy and glittering like a 
holograph. It extended down to sea 
level, blotting out Borneo and the 
western shore of Celebes. 

Without hesitation the Endfray 
plunged, at precisely 120 degrees 
east longitude, into the Nirvana 
Screen. 

Chanting their fatalistic death 
chants, the pilots of the Black 
Angels sent their slim ebon ships 
after him. 

Without perceptible passage of 
time, pursued and pursuers emerged 
over the Indian Ocean at 60 de- 
grees east longitude. 

The same thing would have hap- 
pened in reverse if they had been 
traveling east, or at 45 degrees north 
latitude and the Equator if they 
had been traveling along a north- 
south vector. It was the Orient’s 
master mystery, greater than the 
rope trick. Truth to fell, ho one out- 
side knew for sure whether India 
and China still existed inside the 
Nirvana Screen, or not Explana-

lions ran the gamut from spacewarp 
to mass hypnosis and the Nigerian 
gull-spdL While what the super- 
scientific and/or superphysic Bud- 
dists of the Fourth Dimensional 
Path might §o if they ever came 
out, chilled even Earth’s blackest 
blood. 

Africa loomed, the continent that 
was the home of the biggest ani- 
mals, the biggest magics and the 
biggest bombs in the world. The 
Endfray climbed steeply. Already 
at greater altitude, the Black Angels 
rode the hypotenuse of a collision 
course. 

Ninety miles from intercept, mag- 
nibombs mashed the stratosphere 
everywhere around the Endfray 
and coalesced into one massive in- 
candescence. 

Veering off with hardly nanosec- 
onds to spare, the Black Angels’ 
wing commander bounced home his 
message off the most convenient 
orbital relay: “Target destroyed by 
African antispacecraft fire.” 

K uf before it was received at 
Memphis, there was dropping 
on the Fierce Fuzzy, or Bluecoated 
Ofays of the Chicago Craters Re- 
servation, a shower of packeted 
food — wienerschnitzel, corned beef 
and cabbage, Irish whisky, beer — 
and foam-crated roller skates, the 
latter diverted from a shipment in- 
tended for the great gladiatorial 
ring at Cairo. While down the 
dants of rain from the dismal sky 


there resounded, “Compliments of 
the Endfray of the Ofayl” 

No one knew why the Chicago 
Craters Ofays were called fuzzy, or 
amply refered to as “the fuzz,” 
once all of them were totally bald 
from residual radioactivity. It was 
one of recent history’s many my- 
steries, about which thought was 
discouraged. But anyone could fig- 
ure out that roller skates would be 
an excellent means of transporta- 
tion on crater glass. And by now 
everyone. Black or White, knew 
that the Endfray was an impudent 
and unbearable affront to absolute 
authority. 

Her Serene Darkness made a de- 
rision and took her mind complete- 
ly off the War. She could safely do 
this because her uncles were good 
generals and because her psionic 
intelligence organization was the 
world’s best, with vast powers of 
telepathy, clairvoyance, dairaudi- 
ence, telekinesis and teleportation, 
from the orbiting espers each shut- 
eyed in her capsule to the Blacks 
in Blackness: whole psionic families 
which had lived for generations in 
deep-buried, absolutely anechoic, a- 
optical psi-spy-proof environments, 
their only connections with the up- 
per world being inbound nutrient- 
pipes and oxypipes and quartz- 
cable ultraviolet conductors and 
outbound waste-pipes and report 
lines. Psionic Intelligence’s chief 
task was to spot and course-chart 
bombs lobbed over from Africa and

up from Argentina and Brazil, 
where Africa had an enormous 
beachhead, and then either turn 
them back by telekinesing their 
controls, or else guide atomic in- 
terceptors to them. Her Darkness 
was certain that her espers were the 
world’s finest because she had been 
their working chief before taking 
over her largely conscious, nonpsi- 
onic imperial duties. 

Now like an arboreal black leop- 
ard — slim, flashing-eyed and dan- 
gerous — she gazed down the Wa- 
tusi-Hottentot gap between her and 
her pages. 

“Summon me my psychia- 
witches and sorceresps,” she 
commanded. 

The patter of sprinting bare feet 
faded from the tesselated floor, 
which was a great, diagrammatic 
map of Earth and the spaces 
around. Turning her beautiful, 
small head on her slender, long 
neck, Her Darkness gazed out be- 
tween the narrow pillars of Ver- 
mont marble fretted with Califor- 
nia gold at the rippling blue Mis- 
sissip, and she meditated. 

A page entered and knelt to her, 
lifting a golden tray on which 
gleamed glassy packets, samples 
from the Endfray’s food-drops. She 
silently indicated where to set it. 

A tall, glossy warrior in HQ 
harness folded his arms in the 
Communications doorway and 
intoned, “Acapulco, Halifax and 
Port of Spain have sustained med- 


ium to severe damage from nuclear 
near-misses. Our rockets intercept- 
ed, but not in good time. Orbital 
warnings on the three African at- 
tacks were late and inadequate.” 

“What from the Blacks in Black- 
ness?” Her Serenity inquired. 

“No warning whatever from that 
quarter.” 

She nodded dismissal and re- 
turned to her meditations. 

Yet it seemed hardly picosec- 
onds before the Presence Pavilion 
was once more full and silent, ex- 
cept for the faint susurrus of the 
most respectful breathing and the 
pounding of frightened hearts. 

Qlowly, one by one, Her Dark- 
^ ness gave her assembled psy- 
chiawitches and sorceresps the 
leopard look which her populace 
expected of her and loved, espec- 
ially when they did not have to 
face it. 

Those gathered in the pavilion 
were almost as tall as she and even 
more gorgeously clad, but they 
crouched away from her and 
ducked their heads like terrified 
children. 

Then she asked in a voice that 
set them shivering, “Why is our 
newest and insolentest enemy un- 
caught by you, nay, unreported 
even,” and without waiting for an 
answer commanded, “Read me the 
mind of the Endfray. Ice it and 
slice it, dice it and rice it. Skewer 
him in space, nail him in time.

Situtl him from his lowest note to 
the top of his compass. [Tell me 
his source, his nature and his fate.” 

[Instantly a sorceresp of the 
Seventh Rank babbled, “He is a 
dwarf white trainee! and equipped 
hi a secret laboratory in a branch 
of the Carlsbad Caverns underly- 
ing the White Sands Reservation 
of the Bulge-Brained Ofays. His 
aim, unquestionably, is the foment- 
ing of an Ofay revolt, a Honky in- 
surrection. He is now hovering sev- 
enteen miles above Aswan - St. 
Paul.” 

Without intervening pause, the 
Second Psychiawitch chittered, 
“He is an African agent of Pygmy 
.extraction, a marauder skilled in 
teleportation and telepathy. His 
means of aerial locomotion is a de- 
ceit; he uses slowed-down telepor- 
tation, not speeded - up field flight.

“[The Endfray is not one, but

radioactive atoms over the Somali 
boast. He also speeds east intact 
Over Old Cleveland on the Dead 
Sea'. Another of these dupli- 
cates — ”

“The Endfray is a group-minded

“That’ll be (enough!” interposed 
Her Serene Darkness. “When I 
want improvisations, I’ll summon 
me my artists.” [The faint, jeering 
notes Of an electronic calliope on 
a distant pleasure barge seemed an 
Overtone of her scornful contralto 
Voice. “Facts I desire. Where is the 
Endfray? Take scent and search!” 
And picking up the gold tray, she 
scattered its contents across the 
room in one sweep. 

*Tphe soaring, transparent food- 
•s- packets were snatched, sniffed, 
fingered, held to ear and forehead, 
passed hand to hand. There were 
faint growlings and eager whimper- 
ings as the assembly transformed 
Into a pack. 

Her Serenity directed, “Each 
search that part Of earth or space 
On which she stands,” referring to 
the diagrammatic floor map. “Eet 
not one oozy sea cranny or fissure 


in 



of damp clay cave be overlooked, 
and forget not the far side of the 
moon. Except you... and you,” 
she added, beckoning the First Psy- 
chiawitch and also the sorceresp of 
the Seventh Rank who had been 
first to answer. “The rest, to work! ” 
“How many minutes have wei for 
©ur task?” the Second Psychia- 
witch ventured. The eyes of most 
of the others had already closed or 
gone blank as the minds behind 
them clairvoyantly scanned. 

“I give you each one hundred 
seconds.” Then, turning to the Sev- 
enth-Rank sorceresp, “You spoke 
of an Ofay revolt. Where? When?” 
“One is planned, Your Darkness, 
It will begin in Los Alamos and be 
timed to coincide with an all-out 
African assault ordered by His 
Terrible Tenebrosity.” 
“Ridiculous!” the First Psychia- 
witch interjected in a whisper. “Not 
even His Idiocy would be so stupid 
as to think the reservation Ofays 
might be roused to helpful revolu- 
tion, or the wild Honkies organized 
for any purpose. Nor would even 
His Vileness stoop to use such foul 
and tawdry means.” 

In the Communications door- 
way there appeared a warrior, im- 
passive but white-eyed. Her Seren- 
ity showed him her finger. He in- 
toned, “The Blacks in Blackness 
report that Africa has launched 
from Casablanca a vehicle with a 
two-hundred-million-pound first- 
stage thrust. Window clouds sur- 


round it. Its course bends west.” 

“Two hundred million?” 

“Aye. Ten times that of any 
known Afric or Americ launching 
vehicle.” 

“It is the revolt-sign!” the Sev- 
enth-Rank sorceresp wailed. 

“From its size, it’s more likely 
itself our death-sign, if our inter- 
ceptors let it get over our land,” 
the First Psychiawitch remarked 
coolly. 

“Silence,” Her Darkness said, 
not unkindly. Then, to the room, 
“The hundred seconds are up. 
Where is the Endfray?” 

I n the hundred and seventy- 
odd faces, eyes opened and/or 
came alive with spirit, looking 
toward Her Serenity with a profes- 
sional confidence which, as the sec- 
onds passed and not one of them 
spoke, transformed, again into fear. 

“Has toy one of you not com- 
pleted search?” Her Darkness in- 
quired. “Or failed to make it as 
thorough as I commanded?” 

Heads rotated from side to side. 
Lips formed, “No.” 

“Then the Endfray is nowhere,” 
the First Psychiawitch whispered in 
a voice that was not meant to car- 
ry, but did. 

One cried, “It is as I said. He 
is a fantasm, invisible to psionic 
search.” 

“No, it is as 7 said!” another 
took up. “He is from Altair, tod 
returned there in the twinkling of

IF 



a self-teleportive thought We have 
not searched Altair, only space out 
to Pluto” 

‘ When the possible seems to fail, 
only weak brains grasp at the im- 
possible,” Her Serenity interposed. 
“Stellar teleportation takes per- 
ceptible time and leaves percepti- 
ble dues, as you well know. While 
fantasms make no teleportive food- 
drops land leave no psychic scent 
No, to solve our problem we must 
use an apothegm of Sherlock 
Holmes.” 

Eyes grew puzzled, while the 
First Psychiawitch murmured, 
“Who is that?” 

“Sherlock Holmes was a Crypto- 
black of vast deductive intelligence, 
who lived in — ” Her Darkness 
rapidly starred herself, moving fin- 
gertips to the seven cardinal points 
— “the Tabooed Times ” 

Everyone else copied Her Dark- 
ness and starred herself at once, 
to ward off any ill hap which 
might come from mention of a for- 
bidden area of the continuum. 

Her Serenity continued, “The 
Sherlockian apothegm I have in 
mind i9 this: when all other ex- 
planations are proven false, then 
the least likely explanation must be 
the true one. You have not search- 
ed all of habitable Earth and Solar 
space.” 

The psychiatrist standing bn 
Memphis said hesitantly, “But, 
begging Your Serenity’s pardon, I 
have searched every closet of your 


secret quarters, including the apart- 
ments housing your harem and 
your laboratories of magic and the 
vault guarding your secret for- 
tune.” 

“It is well that you have,” Her 
Darkness replied, smiling most dan- 
gerously. “But those are not the 
sole forbidden or esp-proof vol- 
umes of Earth.” 

“You are thinking of the mantle 
and core?” one asked. 

“I said, ‘habitable/ ” Her Dark- 
ness snapped. “Can you not guess 
the other spot I have in mindfc” i 

A sorceresp standing just south 
of Louisville cried out, “I scent the 
Endfray over Bowling Green! His 
vector, southwest by west. He 
speeds. Already he overpasses 
Clarksville.” 

The psychiawitch standing be- 
tween her and the one on Memphis 
took up with, “And now I catch 
his scent in turn. He comes on fast. 
He is over Paris, Milan, Bells, 
Brownsville, Covington — ” 

“And now — ” the one on Mem- 
phis began. 

The air screamed. The gold- 
chased pillars shook, and the purple 
silken awning snapped and flapped 
as something white flashed through 
the pavilion, tumbling by its blast 
everyone but Her Serenity. 

The scream, which had abruptly 
dropped in pitch as the disturbance 
went by, and then faded* somewhat, 
now rose again in pitch and volume. 

“He returns to buzz us once

more,” the First Psychiawitch 
gasped from the floor. 

Her Dark Serenity — hair un- 
spiraled and straight on end, eyes 
like a mad tiger’s, fists clenched, 
knees bent, slender feet a-stamp — 
incanted rapidly, 

“Null Kull, nufi Rufi, 

Nutt time, null space, 

Nufi motion and null Grace. 
By Kinged Man, Spades, and 
Lovers 

Be winged-dogged, aU that 
hovers. 

Paralysis know, and fear — ” 

The screaming knifed. The pil- 
lars began to shake. Something 
white — 

“ — And drop down here! ” 

S ilence returned with a roar. Some- 
thing white lay on the tesse- 
lated floor — a squat and rigid 
spacesuit like a white oQ drum with 
stubby cylindrical arms and legs, 
but windowless and without sign of 
bead. 

Her Serenity drew and expelled 
three gasping but controlled 
breaths. Her hair recurled With 
faintest rustlings. Those around 
am id, leaned in, and peered, 
though without rising fully from the 
floor Where they had been sent 
sprawling. 

Holding out her right hand prone, 
Her Serenity commanded, “Arise!” 
Like the reverse motion picture 


of a rigid fall, the white spacesuit 
swung erect as if its heels were 
hinged to the floor. 

“Emerge!” Her Serenity con- 
tinued. 

The suit did not open, but out of 
it, as if walking through a white 
wall, there stepped a handsome 
black boy who looked nine years 
old. He Wore a loincloth. Though 
his eyes were shut tight, his face 
was animated, and he smiled as he 
looked up. 

“My Empress — ” he began. 

Her slender hands, snaking for- 
ward to capture him, clamped tight 
on air. 

A chuckle came from the far end 
of the pavilion, where the black boy 
had rematerialized midway between 
fwning and floor. Heads switched 
around to watch him where he 
stood on air. 

Two sorceresps pointed at him, 
the one a wand, the other a yellow 
thighbone. 

Three warriors appeared at the 
Force door, bearing silvery, cone- 
nosed hand weapons. Her Darkness 
snapped her fingers. 

Still shut-eyed, the black boy 
chuckled again. The three warriors 
swayed like ticked bowling pins, 
anus tight to sides, legs tight to- 
gether, bound by the constriction 
fields their weapons had projected 
backfiring on them. While pointed 
Wind and thighbone hung limp as 
cooked spaghetti from the hands 
of the sorceresps. 


114 




IF 



“Any more games?” the black 
boy inquires hopefully. If he’d 
been chubbier, he’d have seemed 
like a wingless cupid. 

“Who are you?” Her Darkness 
demanded far more coolly than she 
felt. 

“The Endfray, of course, Em- 
press,” he replied, looking at her as 
directly as if his eyes had been 
open. “At your service, providing 
— I humbly beg your pardon — 
the service suits me.” 

“Yet you have helped the Hon- 
kies, aided the Ofays — why?” Her 
Darkness asked automatically. She 
was still half in shock. 

The Endfray’s grin widened and 
he quirked his face. Finally, “Just 
for fun,” he said. “No, that’s not 
true. Fact is, you see, I like stories 
of wars and battles, and — ” 

“As any young Black should,” 
Her Serenity interrupted approv- 
ingly. She was regaining her sense 
of command, and her mind was be- 
ginning to work again. 

At her feet the First Psychiawitch 
took fire from her and cried out, 
“Indeed yes! Brave battles! Com- 
plete courage! Stark strength! 
Merciless might! Violence and vic- 
tory!” 

The Endfray hung his head. His 
expression became an odd mixture 
of embarrassment and defiance. 
“But you see, Empress, I always 
like the losing side best. Being with 
the winners is no fun. But siding 
with the losers, when all the odds 


are against them — And you got to 
admit, it’s hard to imagine a losing- 
er side than the Ofays.” 
“Accommodation! Tomism! 
Honky-Iove!” the Second Psy- 
chiawitch cried scandalized. 


“Don’t you know the first sign 
of high intelligence is the faculty 
of violence?” the First Pyschia- 
witch demanded. 

“Inside the Niryaha Screen, they 
think it’s the ability to sit still,” 
the Endfray countered. 

“Strength is virtue. Weakness is 
sin,” the Leading Sorceresp chanted. 

“But you got to remember we 
were the losingest once, we were 
the weak ones, we — ” the Endfray 
continued stubbornly, but his voice 
was drowned in cries of horror at 
his unprefaced and unstarred re- 
ference to the Tabooed Times. 

The warrior appearing at the 
Communications doorway did not 
stand on ceremony, but roared over 
the din, “Our psionic trackers have 
lost touch with the African super- 


missile south of the Azores! The 
Blacks in Blackness have broken 
off their reports.” 


sphere was shocked silence, in 
-*■ which the Endfray’s voice 
sounded out clearly. His grin was 
gone. “Yes,” he said, “and now, big 
as a metal moon, it’s approaching 
Bermuda. Our interceptors rise to 
destroy it. Counter-missiles shoot 
from it and become balls of white 
flame. Our interceptors puff into

nothingness. It still comes on.” 

[The Leading Sorceresp pointed 
him a shaking arm. “He is an 
African agent,” she screeched, 
“sent to disrupt our counsels at 
this moment of crisis.” 

“That’s not true, Empress,” the 
findfray protested* “I’ve stuck 
with America because we are the 
losingest side of this war. We are 
the weak ones. Africa’s going to 
win, unless I — < ” 

Once again his yoke was lost, 
this time in a din of outrage that 
broke off only when Her Dark 
Serenity threw up her arms and 
died, “Fools! Have you not yet 
guessed who the Endfray is? Have 
you not yet solved the Sherlockian 
riddle? The only spot you haven’t 
psionically searched is psi-proof 
Mammoth Cave, immemorial home 
of the Blacks in Blackness and just 
by Bowling Green. He is dearly 
one of them, and their best tracker 
too, highest product of our breeding 
for psionidty. When he Was out 
on his mad mission to the Ofays, 
three bombs got through. When he 
returned home and you could not 
find him, We got reports on the 
launching of the African super-mis-

reports stopped. And did it not 
occur to you that he keeps his eyes 
drat because he has never before

Her Darkness turned on him. 
‘You have your nerve!” 

His embarrassment returned. “I 
told you I’m sorry, Empress.” 

She paused and turned toward 
the Communications doorway, 
where a warrior had appeared. “The 
super-missile still speeds west,” he 
rapped out. “Twenty of our inter- 
ceptors have risen from Colorado 
Springs and thirty from Frisco to 
destroy it.” 

“Imbeciles! Would you break it 
up, to do destruction, while it is 
still over our continent?” 

“Don’t worry, Empress,” the 
Endfray said. 

A second warrior appeared behind 
the first. “Our fifty interceptors 
have escaped control and formed

The Endfray grinned. “And now, 
my Empress, I got to be going. That 
flock needs looking after.” 

A third warrior appeared behind 
the second. “A bliplet, tiny but 
unmistakable, has added itself to 
the fifty blips and one super-blip.” 
“We know,” Her Dark Serenity 
said a shade wearily, waving her 
hand in dismissal. Then, to the

“What exactly, Sister, means the

“0 Your Dread Serenity,” the

formed from English by putting the

adding a long A. Even as Ofay 
means foe, Endfray means friend.” 
“Friend of the Foe,” Her dark- 
ness intoned tiredly “I might have 
deduced all from his name alone.” 
Her eyebrows lifted. “Or Ender of

“However you name him, he 
appears to have a lost-cause fixation

IF ... and WHEN 

< by LESTER DEL REY 


V ary feg stience-fiction stories 
have dealt In any way with 
robots, though the term has been 
used often and creatures of metal 
Have been some of the best char- 
acters found In our literature. But 
these have almost always been 
mere mechanical men or sub-men. 
|n both their nature and the func- 
tions they serve, they are simply 
artificial humans, sometimes lim- 
ited in ability’ and frequently given 
greater strength or toughness, but 
pot essentially different. 

From the yiew of economics — 
Which Is what largely determines 
How! things wdl really develop — 
this is utter nonsense. It makes fief 
sense to use a costly machine to 
do 1 man’s job. There will be fio 
shortage of humanity for such 
work unless there’s a radical change 
ifi our proclivity to breed and 


bring up our own kind. And for 
the jobs requiring strength, an in- 
telligent man inside a power ma- 
chine is still a lot more efficient 
than an intelligent machine. 

Anne McCaffrey suggests that 
the man-inride-machine idea may 
be carried much further in the fu- 
ture. In her story, The Ship Who 
Disappeared, the narrator is an ul- 
timate cyborg — a mixture of or- 
ganic intelligence and mechanical 
parts, in which the human being 
becomes I part of an interstellar 
ship. 

Such | dip should be the per- 
fect place for a robot brain, if one 
is ever developed. The huge num- 
ber of sensors that have to he mon- 
itored in such a complex mechan- 
ism seems to demand an intelli- 
gence with more information in- 
puts than can be hooked to the 


118 



human nervous system; and need 
for almost instantaneous integra- 
tion pf the information also de- 
mands something frith greater speed 
than that found between human 
nerve cells. And the building of 
such a ship is going to be so ex- 
pensive that the added cost of ro- 
bot control no longer seems prohib- 
itive. 

AfiyhoW, the idea of using an 
adapted human being here yiolafes 
another theoretically important ec- 
onomic rule: a man should not be 
used to do a machine’s job. 

[This is a good rule, but it is Be- 
ing Broken regularly in many of 
bur factories today — and prob- 
ably Will be Broken in the future, 
is well. It’s often cheaper to Waste 
i man In some routine mechanical 
bpeirfBon — t such as fastening a 
nut Onto a bolt — than to install 
the self-regulating machinery to re- 
place him. 

Unless the robot is functionally 
and economically superior to a 
man — unless he’s definitely un- 
like a man, in other Words — Miss 
McCaffrey is correct in her choice 
Of a human-ship cyborg. 

S 3 far, science can’t tell us 
much about robots, except 
that they must be different from 
men. The cyberneticists Who work 
frith “thinking” machines have 
done no better than science fiction 
When it comes to robots. 

Computers are simply tools, and 

IP . i . AND WHEN 


the real intelligence they show 
comes from the programming done 
by human operators. Marvelous as 
they are, they lack the sdf-pro- 
gramming and complex learning 
abilities that are minimum require- 
ments for what we call a robot. 

Yet the computer has made the 
robot at least mechandally posable 
today. Thirty years ago, toe idea 
of such a creature was pure fan- 
tasy. The vacuum tubes needed for 
all toe circuits couldn’t have been 
packed inside toe Empire State 
Building, and toe Waste heat from 
the power needed Would have made 
adequate cooling impossible. 

NoW we have gone to toe tran- 
sistor |ng beyond it to toe IC — 
toe integrated circuit; this puts 
several transistors and toe other 
components of a circuit onto an 
etched bit of silicon so small that 
hundreds could be stacked on a 
quarter. The power requirement for 
their operation is also reduced to 
such a small amount that it is no 
longer a problem. A mechanism as 
complex as the organization of 
brain cells needed for human think- 
ing might conceivably be little 
bulkier and draw little more power 
than the body that is needed to 
support a man’s brain. 

But the hardware has far out- 
stripped the software in this case 
— that is, the knowledge of how 
to build bur robot and what to 
build. We simply don’t know 
enough about perception land 


119 



thought yet to have any clear idea 
of how to build them into a think* 
ing machine. 

At a recent Boskone meeting in 
Boston, Dr. Marvin Minsky dis- 
cussed the problem of teaching a 
Computer to "see” — and showed a 
film of his program. By adding a 
scanning tube from television to the 
computer, he had worked out a pro- 
gram that enabled if to distinguish 
various cubes well enough to stack 
them up into piles. This represents 
a difficult progress in machine per- 
ception. But it’s still a long way 
from the human ability to look at 
a circle from the side and see a 
circle, rather than the oval it be- 
comes, or to build up a pattern 
from many distorted images. 

But we still haven’t the faintest 
idea of how our own internal think- 
ing machine functions. We don’t 
Know how we organize the percep- 
tions into patterns, nor even how 
we store them as memories. Lately, 
there has been some speculation 
that eveiything we had guessed 
about memory in the past is Wrong. 
We assumed that each bit of in- 
formation was somehow registered 
somewhere in a certain cell. In- 
stead!, it may be that memory is 
diffuse, and thaf everything is 
somehow impressed everywhere. 

This is called the hologram the- 
ory of memory, since it behaves 
l&e the holograms used in laser 
demonstrations of three-dimension- 
a| projections. On such a film, 


every bit of the film contains the 
whole picture — and cutting off a 
piece for use still yidds the whole 
image, rather than only part of it, 
though the fineness of detail suf- 
fers. 

If so, we don’t know how it is 
done, nor how such memory can 
be used. And we don’t even know 
whether this is a fair guess or just 
another blind alley of speculation. 

fT^Teverthdess, work has already 
started in an attempt to build 
a robot. He already has a name*— 
Frederick, for Family Robot for 
Entertainment, Discussion, Edu- 
cation, the Retrieval of Informa- 
tion and the Collation of Knowl- 
edge. And the project is being un- 
dertaken quite seriously by a group 
of sdentists at the Edinburgh De- 
partment of Machine Intdligence 
and Perception. (They haven’t 
shortened that to EDMIP — yet.) 

This will be a task in which 


many fidds of research can be 
pooled. It is headed by Professor 
Donald Michie, who is a biologist, 
and his two chief fellow-workers 
Will be a psychologist and a theo- 
retical chemist. 

Frederick Will never be a me- 
chanical man. His brain may be 
housed in a building separate from 
his “sense organs,” or even in sev- 
eral scattered units, linked by ca- 
bles. Nobody is interested at pre- 
sent in giving him a body, beyond 
some kind of mechanical arm or 


1M 


IF 



manipulating tool. He isn’t meant 
to be a working model of a science- 
fiction robot, but simply a tool for 
research into how mechanical sim- 
ulation of thinking can be achieved. 

[The men working on him have 
ambitious enough a project without 
trying to make him fully human- 
oid. [They want to find ways for 
storing information as patterns of 
memory for faster retrieval and for 
his own use. They want to enable 
him to perceive and manipulate ob- 
jects under wider and less specific 
conditions than now possible. And 
he must be able to learn. He must 
be able to program himself to a 
large extent. When the programs 
he is given don’t work, he must be 
able to revise the rules and make 
up new ones to fit the recurring 
hew situations he will face. Hope- 
fully, he will learn to communicate 
significantly about what he per- 
ceives and learns. This won’t be in 
English, probably, but in a more 
generalized language than previous 
special computer languages that 
hkve been developed. 

[The results Won’t prove much 
about how the human brain thinks, 
directly. We can already duplicate 
some of the specific actions of the 
Eraih, but there is no evidence that 
the circuits used do their work in 
the same way that the human nerve 
cells do. 

But science will learn a great 
deal about one form of thinking 
from Frederick, and that will be 


far more than we now know. From 
such knowledge, it should be pos- 
sible to form a reasonable body of 
theory about thought in general, 
and from that we can go on to test 
and formulate theories about how 
the human mind functions. 

And from what we can then 
learn about human thought, it will 
be possible to go back and make 
a far better attack on the problem 
of simulating thought in £ robot. 

'T'he robots that evolve from 
such a continuous program 
won’t be human simulacra in their 
thinking, however. We can give 
them a somewhat similar set of “in- 
stincts” — since they’ll be prepro- 
grammed by liumans, just as we’re 
preprogrammed with human in- 
stincts by our evolutionary back- 
ground. We may even find ways to 
give them the equivalent of our bi- 
ological drives, such as a pleasure- 
pain response. But they’ll still have 
to think in non-humah ways. 

Dr. Claude E. Shannen — “the 
father of information theory” — 
outlined some basic differences in 
a symposium at MIT on Manage- 
ment and the Computer of the Fu- 
ture. According to him, a robot’s 
circuits will be precise and de- 
signed for their functions, where 
human cell linkages are random 
and depend oh redundancy to work. 
Also, a robot will think serially — 
step-by-step, but at 3 fantastic 
rate; while men apparently think 


IF • » • 


AND WHEN 


121 



in a parallel fashion, attacking a 
problem In sort of an all-over fash- 
ion. 

In time, such differences might 
be brought closer together, of 
course. But there is one essential 
difference that wQl never change, 
because it is the one big advantage 
of robot thinking. 

A robot necessarily carries bn 
the maneuvers of thinking — what- 
ever they may be — at a rate thou- 
sands of times faster than the hu- 
man brain can. Messages travel 
along nerves and across the gaps 
between cells at a rate measured 
in thousands of feet per second; 
electrical pulses travel along wires 
at over a hundred thousand miles 
a second. A nerve cell has a re- 
sponse cycle measured in thou- 
sandths of a second; and the cir- 
cuits of a computer today operate 
in nanoseconds — thousandths of 
a millionth of a second. At his 
slowest, the robot is going to have 
his thought processes operating a 
hundred thousand times as fast as 
those of a human being. 

Perhaps with that speed of 
thought, a far less complex cluster 
of “cells” will be able to do the 
job for him. He can make serial 
thinking work, where we have no 
time to trace every step down, but 
must have enough circuits to ex- 
amine our memories in parallel. 


With that difference, a robot 
can’t think like a human being. It 
would be like a man trying to 
think by waiting a whole day be- 
tween each word he utters! The 
robot is going to have to use dif- 
ferent symbol structures in his 
mind, and that means he’s going 
to perceive his “reality” different- 
ly from the perception of any hu- 
man being. 

Our robot may some day be su- 
perior to us, or he may always be 
inferior — probably because Sre 
won’t permit him to be otherwise. 
But his thoughts are going to be 
alien to us in a sense that the 
thoughts of no protoplasmic brain 
can ever be alien! 

Out of that alienness will come 
the abilities he has which are un- 
ique to him and useful to us be- 
cause they are not talents which 
we can develop. We can’t possibly 
know what good he will be until 
we begin to build his prototypes. 
Unquestionably, he’ll have uses; 
and those uses will be unique, not 
imitations of human activity. 

There’s one comforting thought, 
however. If men and robots hre so 
different in thought and function, 
they won’t be in competition. 
They’ll form a natural symbiotic 
pair, with no danger of the robot- 
human war so often described in 
early science fiction. BND

From the envelope he removed 
a sheaf of snapshots. There were 
several different shots. Each in 
quadruplicate. All showed a near- 
ly identical scene; they must have 
been taken in quick succesion. 
The subjects were two men. One

both in a business envelope. A car-

- 1 “Good,” he grunted. He dropped 
them to the floor. They slipped 
and fluttered until they were 
blanketing the floor around his 
feet. He did not bend to retrieve 
them. Instead he began walking on 
them, wiping his feet on them, 
scuffling them as he might a door- 
mat. 

When he was satisfied with the 
results, he picked them up and 
shuffled them into an untidy pile 
on his desk. From another file 
drawer he removed a set of letters 
and envelopes. Some of the letters 
were typed — on demonstration 
machines in Macy’s — and some 
were hand-scrawled. The latter bad 
cost an average of fifty cents 
apiece and had been written with 
careful effort by the winoa and 
derelicts he bad found when he had 
spent an afternoon three months 
earlier wandering from Union 
Square down Fourth Avenue to the 
Bowery. The paper used for the 
different letters was a motley va- 
riety, ran ging from monogrammed 
sheets in odd sizes and tints to 
lined paper tom from a pad. 

T he fop letter was typewritten. 

It said, “Dear Sirs. I found 
this crazy paper oti the street and 
I think its disgrisefull and you out 
to do something about it right- 
away.” Redwing folded if together 
with One of the footprinted mimeo- 
graphed sheets, and inserted them 
both in an envelope addressed to 


“The Justice Department, Washing- 
ton DC.” 

The other letters were similar In 
sentiment. They Were addressed to 
congressmen and senators, with 
varying accuracy, as well as to a 
number of governmental agencies, 
including the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare. 
Meticulously, Redwing folded the 
dirty sheets with their indignant 
letters and sealed them into their 
respective envelopes. 

“This evening, Linda, I want you 
to take five of these out to Brook- 
lyn With you and mail them in 
boxes in different zones. They 
have return addresses — you can 
post them nearby.” 

Linda shrugged. “There goes my 
evening, just driving ground. 
Couldn’t they all just have mailed 
them in Grand Central Station on 
their way home?” 

“You can take off an hour early,” 
Redwing said. 

That morning Redwing and his

Redwing stifled his inward impulse. 
An aroma of blended deodorant, hair 
cream, after-shave lotion and 
month wash assailed him; he want- 
ed to wrinkle his nose in disgust 
and turn his back. Folkes was, at 
something less than thirty, already 
neatly preserved in all the proper 
emb almin g agents. His sandy hair 
was too thin, but brushed impec- 
cably in place and held there as 
if lacquered. His shining face had 
a pinkness that would never become 
ruddy. His outstretched hand was 
so plump that his knuckles were 
dimpled. And it was because of these 
qualities and the others they all too 
accurately suggested that Redwing 
had decided immediately that 
Folkes would be useful. He had let 
the man cultivate him. 

“Share my table?” Folkes asked, 
his hand still out. 

“Certainly, Chet,” Redwing said 
warmly. “Just let me get washed 
up first.” He turned as if not 
noticing Folkes’s limp gesture. His 
hands were itching badly now, and 
he needed to remove the transparent 
rubber surgical gloves he always 
wore in the A & L office. Once in 
the washroom he could soak his 
hands for a few minutes before talc-

Once seated at Folkes’s table in

Redwing nodded. "They did. 
We’re In the midst of a very prom- 
ising line of research.” 

"Is that right?” Folkes said. 
“You know, I don’t believe you’ve 
ever told me much about your pro- 
ject.” 

“That’s true,” Redwing agreed. 
He glanced down the menu. 

"Something to do with politics, 
isn’t it?,” Folkes asked. 

“Group dynamics,” Redwing said. 
“A very rough science. We’re still 
in the early stages of setting things 
up ini terms that can be program- 
med, and I don’t anticipate full- 
scale application of our findings for 
use in political prediction for an- 
other, oh, ten years yet.” 

“Group dynamics, eh?” Folkes 
said, trying to sound both know- 
ledgeable and curious. 

“The behavior of groups, you 
might say,” Redwing amplified. 
“There’s a strong analogy to atomic 
physics. An individual electron 
is pretty unpredictable, but 
statistically you know exactly what 
they’ll do. Human beings are an 
individualistic lot, taken one by 
one. But group behavior is another 
story. Mob psychology, political 
action; if you can peg down enough 
of the valuables, you can rough out 


a workable equation. Right now, 
we’re still forking with the rudi- 
ments, but if our present research 
pans out, we’ll be a long way toward 
a genuine political science.” 

( tXTTell, that’s marvelous, I must 
* » sayl Just marvelous! You 
know, I certainly am amazed at all 
the things they’re doing with science 
these days. Why, it seems only yes- 
terday we hadn’t even men bn the 
moon, and now we’ve not only got 
them on Mars, but flatwall color 
TV, and — ” 

“And the Russians have bases on 
Mars too, as well as their own po- 
sitron bomb,” Redwing said. His 
voice dropped and became more in- 
tense. “It’s unfortunate that they 
had to be first, but that’s tKe 
breaks, huh? Of course we really 
don’t have to be afraid of the Rus- 
sians these days, anyway, but it is 
a little scary to realize that once 
every eighteen hours a Chinese 
space station passes over our coun- 
try, isn’t it? Some people have 
trouble sleeping when they get id 
speculating over how) close the 
Chinese are to the positron bomb, 
now that they have the delivery 
system. Bui that’s progress, I guess. 
You can’t stop process.” 

Folkes looked up sharply from 
his meal. “What’s that, MarEH

Redwing smiled. If was a feline!

wealthy dubmen — “would never

Folkes tried to chuckle at what 
he sensed must be the joke. “But, 
Mark — fifty years ago, how many 
Indians had ...” IBs voice seemed 
to lose all impetus and trickle off 
as he realized what he was saying. 

“Hit oil, made their mint, cast 
off their loin doths, and come off

finishing the question for him. “Not 
many, Fm sure, Chester. It’s a sign 
of changing times. Sometimes 
change is not fully appreciated. 
Sometimes it shakes somnambulent 
men from their quiet slumbers with 
the threat of extinction. Sometimes, 
Chester, it will jar a man into rash 
action. Things start happening just 
a little too fast for him to compre-

Bang, goes the weasel!” 

“But, ahh, Mark. Are you saying

“You can’t stop progress. That’s 
meaningless,” Redwing said. “But

donic. 


“Mirk, I’m afraid £ don’t undeg-

Redwing pondered how long it 
would take Folkes to lose the flab, 
after the food stopped. 


K fter luncheon, Redwing picked 
up an early edition of the after-* 
noon Post, and admired the head-*] 
line, “FINANCIER LEAPS.” The

AT ark Redwing did not return

“What’s up, Boss?” Linda asked 
solicitously. “Seymore’s pretty

Redwing sat down and stared out 
the single office window at the wall 
of the airshaft opposite. “No, not 
at all. I wish you wouldn’t keep 
riding him. You’ve never met the 
man. He’s an extremely able indi- 
vidual, exactly the man for the job, 
my perfect front man. Trouble is, 
he’s too good.” 

“What do you mean? On the 
phdne he’s another one of these 
perfect Whiteys, all full of hearty 
hello’s, how-are-you’s, always telling 
me how we must meet some time, 
since we have the same boss. He 
strikes me as the sort who’s better 
at getting a job than holding it. I 
get the feeling every time I talk to 
him that he’s making a long-dis- 
tance pass at me.” She shrugged. 
“He should only know.” 

Redwing shook his head impa- 
tiently. “That’s just the mold they 
cast scientists from these days. If 
he hadn’t met me, Seymore would 
be bucking for a Government re- 
search grant or a niche in some 
huge corporation. Like everyone in 
his field, any intelligent man who 
wants to get anywhere, he’s taken 
on the protective coloration. You 
should see him operate on those 
people from Ford. 

“No, that’s not the problem. Sey- 
more is an okay man, all right. It’s 
his job to set up the main computer 
program for us and to coordinate 
all the rest. He’s already through 
the prelims — and it’s the direction 
he finds himself headed toward that 


is scaring him. He’s smart. He can 
evaluate the stuff he’s feeding into 
that program. And he’s been getting 
closer and closer to the truth. 

“As far as he knows, the Institute 
for Population Studies is simply 
trying to program a long-term study 
of political behavior, with an eye 
to a little forecasting in times to 
come. But nobody in the Institute 
is aware of my real reasons for set- 
ting it up, nor the uses I’ve been 
putting the program to. No one has 
any idea of my real purposes. They 
naively believe they’re helping to 
turn political science into a real 
science, and they’re full of what 
they think it’ll do for human re- 
lations and all that baloney. God 
help us. If this sort of thing ever 
was used in politics . 

“But, anyway, Seymore is catch- 
ing on.” 

“How could he? You haven’t 
been doing anything to make him 
suspicious, have you?” Linda asked. 

'O edwing swivled around to stare 
at her. She was not unappeal- 
ing. “I don’t have to. It’s all there 
already. He’s reading it out of the 
preliminary results and the data 
we’ve amassed. The headline on 
Victor crystallized it for him. 

“The human brain, Linda, is a 
vastly superior and more efficient 
computer than anything we’ve yet 
built. Those chains of protein mole- 
cules store and remember every- 
thing. Every so often the subcon-

mmu correlates a couple of items 
mi comes up with a ‘hunch,’ which 
far the most part we ignore. Sey- 
more — the man has a broad grasp 
of everything programmed for the 
computer. It’s all up there in his 
own computerlike brain.” Redwing 
tapped his own forehead. “It’s just 
waiting for his subconscious to sort 
it all out. 

“Now ideally he should arrive 
at the same conclusions. There’s 
no magic to a computer, Linda. It 
just adds things up. Its only real 
advantage is its single-mindedness. 
It operates without bias, without 
the built-in ‘noise’ of distractions 
we humans have. It doesn’t require 
a particular answer in order to just- 
ify its existence to itself. It has no 
prejudices. It just weighs all the 
factors, like a super adding ma- 
chine, and reports the balance. 

“There have been human com- 
puters — people with trick minds, 
the lightning calculators, the type 
who work huge sums without ef- 
fort, or recall or compute the date 
of any day of the year, for any 
year in history. Most are idiots. 
Simple-minded. It’s not a survival 
trait. 

“But most of us have minds clut- 
tered with too many problems, too 
many unrelated thoughts and ideas. 
Our emotions get in the way. And 
we don’t trust bur intuition. So 
there is Seymore; he’s been picking 
and subconsciously sorting all the 
data he’s been feeding the machine, 
lie 


“There’s only one answer. And 
it’s nagging at him, at the fringes 
of his consciousness. Victor’s death 
was very upsetting to him. He can’t 
quite figure out why, but it is dis- 
turbing the man, Linda. And that 
disturbs me.” 

Linda nodded, slowly. “I see. But 
just how much can he find out?” 

“The broad outlines: the trends 
and countertrends. They’re all there 
in the data; — I know; that’s where 
I got them. The death of the in- 
dividual among the masses. Popu- 
lation pressures. Racial friction. 
Religious friction. The growth of 
insuperable pressures, and mono- 
lithic power blocs. The signs are 
Ml there, just as I’d originally in- 
stituted them. The Institute’s study 
necessarily confirms them. 

“If you look for them, the trends 
are obvious: power massing, gaps 
growing. The world’s getting too 
small. No man is more than two 
hours, by HST, from any other 
man in the world. You can’t go off 
and live on an island any more. 
A bad cabbage crop in France will 
lay ten thousand men off Detroit 
assembly-lines. No one has to make 
decisions any more. Responsibility 
is a corporate function. How much 
longer can we wait for the Chinese 
and hope for prosperity to human- 
ize them? One more major famine 
over there, and they’ll take us all 
with them, just for spite. The races 
aren’t assimilating any more — 
they’re dividing. And where will

our allegiance go?” He laughed 
mirthlessly, “You’ve heard it all 
from me before. The world is one 
great machine now, and all of us 
are cogs within wheels within cogs 
within wheels. We’re all geared in 
together, and we don’t have a fly- 
wheel to balance us. We’re a steam- 
roller without brakes. 

“It’s all there for Seymore to 
read. A huge machine on the verge 
of going completely out of control. 

“And you know what we have to 
do, Linda. When a machine goes 
but of control, you have to stop it, 
before it blows up and destroys 
you. 

“That’s our job. To stop the ma-

TVedwing worked late that night. 

He spent the next hour making 
phone calls and jotting notes. Sever-

satellite. 

Following that, he wrote letters, 
brief and anonymous, on Wool- 
worth’s typing bond. Occasionally, 
before seeing an envelope, he would 
tuck in a photostat or photograph. 
Once he opened the safe that was 
behind the file drawer marked “M”

denomination, which he dropped in-

sheet of paper. By the time he was

finished, the hour was late. He 
stood and stretched, then went out 
in the hall, locking his office be- 
hind him as though leaving it, and 
soaked his hands for five minutes 
in the washroom down the ball. 
His hands felt puffy and sore when 
he added more talc, snapped the 
gloves back on, and returned to the 
office, but he did not doff them for 
the night until his letters were in 
the mail and he was on his way 
home.

* * Folkes, after taking a rather 
strong gulp of his martini, “it is 
really not safe to be out bn the 
streets, these days. Can you im- 
agine it? There I was, taking an 
afternoon stroll from the apartment 
just trying to work up a little hon- 
est appetite, you know, and the 
next thing I knew, there were bul- 
lets flying all around me! This 
seedy little colored man, if you 
know what I mean, he was running 
down Sutton Place with a suitcase 
in one hand, and these policemen 
were shooting at him.” He mopped 
his forehead with the napkin, ob- 
livious to the reproving stare of the 
approaching waiter. “They got him, 
of course. Along with all the glass 
in the telephone booth on the cor- 
ner across the street. They shot 
him and knocked him down in a 
heap right in the middle of the side- 
walk, right in the direction in which 
I was heading. The suitcase* fell

opea and a little pile of dirty laun- 
dry ipilled out of it. I heard one 
of the policeman swearing about it, 
and about how it would have to be 
covered up. I can’t imagine what 
he was talking about. I was so up- 
set that I hailed a cab. I would 
have crossed the street if a cab 
hadn’t come along, you know that?” 
He downed the remainder of his 
martini and signaled for another. 
“Totally unnerving, to be shot at 
on Sutton Place” 

“I can imagine,” murmured Red- 
wing. 

T kere are some quite fascinating 
stories in here, if you know 
.Where to look for them,” Redwing 
remarked to Linda a few days later. 
He tapped his copy of the morn- 
ing Times with his forefinger. 

“For instance, scandal has struck 
the Church. The Archbishop of the 
pasfem Diocese shot himself. A sin, 
pSu know. There was a riot in 
fettle; somebody started potshot- 
ting the police during the Boeing 
strike, and they attacked the strik- 
ers. A shame; the strike had almost 
been resolved. And there’s an edi- 
torial about that regiment of Ameri- 
can Legion hotheads who invaded 
the East Village last night looking 
lor pacifists to beat up. Another 
JgSJ 1 ! crashed into Long Island 
almost immediately after 
f|kebff from Kennedy, and yet an- 
Sther mistook the Indian Ocean for 
my land. The FAA is considering 
*4 


grounding them all. Douglas is 
screaming, of course.” 

“Was that all us?” 

Redwing nodded, flashing his 
surprisingly canine teeth in a mo- 
mentarily smile. “All but the Amer- 
ican Legion.” 

“You’ve really got your program 
rolling, now,” she said. Her tone 
was strange. 

“Push a little here . pull a lit- 
tle there,” Mark said. “Yes. Phase 
one is finished. We’ve flexed our 
muscles sufficiently to prove their 
capabilities. Now it’s time for phase 
two — the main program.” 

“I just don’t know,” Linda said. 
“I mean, I can’t see what good it’s 
really doing, Mark. All I can see is 
that you’ve hurt a few individ- 
uals, ruined a few lives. And now 
you’re aiming to destroy more 
people. But you keep saying that 
there is no individual responsibil- 
ity any more. How can you expect 
this to add up to anything more 
than — ” 

“More than a little nastiness?” 
Redwing sighed. “That’s where good 
old Population Studies comes in. 
I’m not hitting out at random, Lin- 
da. This is judo, an advanced sort 
of judo. 

“I already knew things were 
heading out of control. You knew 
that. What I wanted, what I had 
to find, was a way to cripple them 
without just accelerating the big 
bang. I had to find a way to sabo- 
tage things, slow them down, with- 

IF 



out completely destroying every- 
thing. Sure, Population Studies is 
a front, but it’s a good front, be- 
cause it’s real. It’s equally valid for 
what people think it’s doing. But 
its real purpose, the real reason I 
set it up, is to weigh the masses 
of data, to show me the time and 
the place for another judo chop, 
another crippling blow. By hitting 
at the people I do, when I do, it’s 
as though I knocked the tooth out 
of a gear — and made the mach- 
inery falter. It’s not the specific 
men I hit, it’s the things they sym- 
bolize, and what I strike through 
them. Like I said: chipping teeth 
from the gears. The gears aren’t 
stripped, but — ” 

“I see,” Linda said. Her tone was 
emotionless. “It’s all a matter of 
gears and tactical chops to you. Just 
a matter of choosing the right targets 
at the right time?” There was some- 
thing in the way she said it that 
kept Redwing from automatically 
agreeing with her. 

“What’s the matter, Linda? De- 
veloped a conscience all of a sud- 
den?”

She’ll go along with my ideas; 
she wants to see things changed too.’ 
But you’re a rich man’s son. It’s 
like everything else for you — it’s 
all just abstractions.” 

He stared at her with concealed 
surprise. There was a hint of tears 
at the corners of her eyes. It was 
the first, emotional outburst he’d 
seen from her. 

“I forgot you took a Ph.D. in 
sociology, Linda,” he said calmly. 
“I forgot you knew all the answers 
already.” 

There was a long silence. Then: 
“I’ve been talking with Seymore,” 
Linda said quietly. It was a bomb 
which fell, ticking, to the floor be- 
tween them. 

His face flickering no change of 
expression, Mark asked, “When 
was this?” 

“Yesterday, when you were out. 
He called, he wanted to talk to you 
again. It was very urgent, he said. 
I asked him what he wanted. I told 
him I knew the main details of the 
program. 

“He told me, Mark. He told me 
what was happening — what’s real-

“You didn’t tell me he’d called.” 

“No.” 

There was another long silence. 
Suddenly the shrill yammer of the

eqople of days. I — < well, I don’t 
want to cry bn your shoulder, old 
man. Perhaps tomorrow, eh?” 
“Certainly, Chester,” Redwing 
sa&d. “Tomorrow.” He hung the 
phone up, and swung back around 
to face Linda. “Where were we?” 
“Seymore.” 

“Yes.” 

“Do you want to know what he 
said?” 

Redwing did not answer. 

“He told me he was running some 
independant checks of his own, 
th at he’d had a hunch about things 
and he wanted to check it out. It 
was Victor’s suicide. You were 
right about that, Mark. That’s what 
set him off. It was too neat. It 
happened at too opportune a time. 
He wasn’t sure for whom it was op- 
portune, but ... He worked it but. 
A week earlier, or a week later — 
it wouldn’t have had the effect it 
had. It was just too pat for him. 


So he started integrating a new fac- 
tor: a party or parties dedicated to 
taking advantage of just such weak 
points as in the Victor case. And 
he extrapolated the trends.” 

44 A nd just what did he find out, 

** Linda?” Redwing asked soft- 

iy- 

“Chaos. Total chaos. Not just a 
little slowing down. The reverse. He 
said that things Were snowballing, 
that it was like a finely tuned ma- 
chine. If you threw it out of bal- 
ance, the internal vibrations Would 
tear it apart. You can’t slow if doWn 
because that’s how the balance is 
lost. He made some predictions, 
Mark. You want to know a couple?” 

Redwing nodded, with a vague 
show of polite interest. His mind 
was elsewhere. Seymore was going 
to be a problem. One he’d have to 
deal With. 

“He predicted that there’d be 
a breakdown in labor-management 
negotiations throughout most of the 
major industries. He said any spark, 
almost, could set it off. He said 
that there might be an aviation 
crisis. He suspected that there 
might be a popular uprising against 
organized religion.” 

“That’s not all,” Redwing said. 
“Tonight on Public Television, in 
the midst of the Disney Retrospec- 
tive, a fifteen-minute piece of ani- 
mated pornography will be shown 
in living color. Snow White never 
looked so good.”

Linda glared at him, wordlessly, 

“Buf you’re right, at that,” Red- 
wing said. "Let’s not quibble over 
terms. We have only one foresee- 
able future: chaos. We have two 
possible Ways to get there: slow 
disintegration, or the big bang. If 
Seymore weren’t an idiot, he’d 
have tried an extrapolation along 
both lutes instead of just the one. 
PC want chaos, yes. But I want the 
chaos that man can survive. Yes, 
I 'do want to reduce our gleaming 
technology to rubble.. I want to 
bring the Whole stinking mess down 
around our ears, Linda, because as 
hard as it’ll hurt, it’s better than 
extinction for the race.” 

Redwing rose from his desk and 
Began to pace. “Ever since we’ve 
had atomic power, we’ve been in 
acute danger. And since the posi- 
troH bomb has been a reality we’ve 
Been living on borrowed time. 

"There are two schools of 
thought* One holds that power is 
so dangerous that it must not be 
held by individuals, but by groups 
— corporations. The other feels 
that power must be held by a small 
and closely watched number of in- 
dividuals. 

"But they are both wrong. 
As long as power easts in such a 
tremendous concentration, it doesn’t 
matter Who holds it. La any bands, 
it’s tod dangerous. We must disarm 
the bomb. We must strip out the 
fuse aid scatter the components to 
the winds.

“In other words, Linda, we must 
create chaos. My ancestors had the 
right idea. When mankind is re- 
duced to small and semi-isolated 
communities at best — Or subsis- 
tence-level existence at worst — 
when the lines of communications 
and transportation are completely 
broken so that there can be no war- 
ring nations poised at the brink of 
disaster, then the human race can 
take a deep breath and begin to 
live again. 

"We’ve been pushed too far, too 
fast. We’re breeding out of control. 
We’re a half-mad cage of over- 
crowded rats. We’re losing our souls 
in the hell of our own making. 

"It has to end, Linda. It will 
end. Of that there can be nd doubt-

we control it sufficiently?] Or will 
it wipe us all out?

present lives really living, anyway, 
taught as they are in sterile boxes, 
pressured from birth to death in 
anonymity. 

"I don’t kid myself I’m really 
doing them a favor, the Ones who 
Won’t make if. But I’ll be doing 
the race one.”

4 4'V7" 0U poor naive, idiotic fool,” 
Linda said quietly and bit- 
terly. “You, you — idealist . Back to 
nature. Back to your father’s fa- 
ther’s ways. Solve everything by 
turning the dock back. Do you think 
that destroying this country alone 
would accomplish anything — be- 
yond doing the Sino-Soviet Bloc’s 
work for them? Do you really think 
you’d be doing a favor for anyone ?” 
Mark sighed, turned to stare out 
the small dingy window. Sunlight 
slanted down the airshaft, warming 
and ydlowing the sooty brick wall 
opposite. “You can’t conquer a 
country when it isn’t a country any 
more,” he said. “Not when it’s noth- 
ing but an area of tribes and in- 
dividuals, and all the channels for 
control are gone. But that’s an 
academic point in any case. I’m not 
quite so much alone in this as you 
may have thought, Linda. And in 
any case, they’re too closely joined 
to us, economically, to escape the 
scythe. You’re right — it’s a snow- 
ball. It won’t observe the artific- 
ial distinction of national borders. 
I’m sorry you’ve chosen to react in 
this way, Linda. Because this is 
my mission. I will not be stopped.” 
Behind him, Linda reached a 
shaking hand into her purse and 
removed a small gun. It was a .25 


calibre solid-fuel, self-propelling- 
slug Schneikel automatic. It was as 
thin as a cigarette case; it was de- 
signed for a woman’s purse. 

‘“I was afraid of that.” Her voice 
caught and something about it 
alerted Redwing. He started to turn. 

“The trial period’s over, you said. 
And Seymore says soon we’ll be 
over the brink, past the point of no 
return. Somebody has to stop you,” 
Linda said. “I wish it didn’t have 
to be me. Good-bye, Mark.” 

The violent hissing of the small 
gun blended with her last words. 
It was much easier than she’d 
thought it would be. The gun lay 
easily in her hand, and when she 
squeezed the trigger it did not 
recoil. 

T^he first shot was high, and she 
-*• thought she’d missed, as Red- 
wing threw himself at her. The sec- 
ond and third shots caught him in 
his throat and chest. It was much 
messier than she’d expected. 

The cream phone began to ring. 

Redwing’s leg kicked weakly at 
the desk, then lay still. 

With subdued haste, the sabo- 
teur gathered up her few things 
from the office and left. 

The phone continued to ring for 
a long time. END

4 CTT'ather?” says the dark horse 
shadow upon the' castle wall. 
"Yes, Typhon.” . 

"Father I” 

A sound to break the ears occurs 
then. 


"Anubis said you had perished 1” 

"He lied. Osiris must have wield- 
ed the Hammer, saying that he was 
saving the universe, for I was los- 
ing the battle.” 

"That is true,” says the Prince. 

"I was not losing, however. I 


139 





was winning. He wished to slay me, 
not the Nameless.” 

"How did you survive?” 

"A reflex. I went into fugue as 
the blow descended. A fraction of it 
fell upon me, and Anubis retrieved 
me, senseless, and spirited me off to 
his House. He scattered my gear 
across the Midworlds. He trained 
me as his weapon.” 

"To slay Thoth?” 

"That was the task he gave me.” 
"Then he diesl” said Typhon and 
rears, flaming. 

^'Desist, brother,” says the 
Prince. "He did not succeed, and 
we may yet have a use for the dog.” 
But already the dark horse shadow 
Has faded, and the Prince lowers 
his head. 

He looks to Set. 

"Should wel follow to stop him?” 
"Why? Anubis has lived a thou- 
sand years too long. Let him guard 
himself now. — And how? Even if 
wl would, there is none can stop 
Typhon when the madness lies up- 
on him.” 

"That is true,” says the Prince 
and turning, he addresses Vramin: 
"If you would serve me further, 
my former Angel of the Seventh 
Station, go you to the House of 
the Dead. It will soon require the 
presence of one who can operate 
the machinery.” 

"Typhon was Lord of the House 
of Fire,” says Vramin. 

"Yes, but I fear he will not re- 
main in the House of the Dead af- 

140 


ter he has gained vengeance. If I 
know my brother, he will then 
seek out the one who wielded the 
Hammer. He will go after Osiris.” 
"Then I shall remove me to the 
House of the Dead. Will you ac- 
company me, Madrak?” 

"If the Prince has no further use 
for me here.” 

"I have not. You may go.” 
"Lord,” says Vramin, "it is kind 
of you to trust me again, knowing 
the part I played in the Wars of the 
Stations.” 

"Those days are gone, and we 
are different people. Are we not?” 
"I hope so — and thank you.” 
The Prince crosses his arms and 
bows his head. Vramin and Mad- 
rak vanish. 

"How,” says the Steel General, 
"may I assist you?” 

"We go again to fight the Name- 
less,” says the Prince Who Was A 
Thousand. "Will you come and 
stand in reserve?” 

"Yes. Let me summon Bronze.” 
"Do so.” 

The winds of Marachek stir 
the dust. The sun flickers its way 
into another day. 

V ramin stands in the great Hall 
of the House of the Dead, 
holding his Maypole cane. Its 
streamers go forth, entering into all 
the passageways, visible or other- 
wise, which come together at that 
place. 

At his side, Madrak shifts his 

IF 



weight from foot to foot and stares 
about him. 

Vramin’s eyes glow, and the light 
dances within them. 

''Nothing. Nothing alive. No- 
where,” he says. 

"Then Typhon has found him,” 
says Madrak. 

"Typhon is not here either.” 
"Then he has slain him and de- 
parted. He doubtless seeks Osiris 
now.” 

"I wonder. ...” 

"What else could it be?” 

"I do not know. But now I am 
master here, by delegation of the 
Prince. I will find the places of 
power and learn their functions.” 
"Yet once you broke faith with 
the Prince.” 

"That is true — and he forgave 
me.” 

Then Vramin seats himself upon 
the throne of Anubis, and Madrak 
pays him homage, saying: 

"Hail, yramin! Master of the 
House of the Dead"” 

"You need bend no knee to me, 
old friend. Please rise. I will need 
your assistance, for this place is 
quite different from Seventh Sta- 
tion, where once I reigned.” 

And for hours Vramin studies the 
secret controls about the throne. 
Then, " Anubis 1” cries a voice 
which he knows is not the voice 
of Madrak. 

And somehow he mimics the 
bark, the whine: 

^Yes?” 


"You were right. Horus was de- 
feated, and he returned here. But 
he is gone again.” 

It is the voice of Osiris. 

He gestures with his cane, and 
the big window appears in the mid- 
dle of the air. 

"Hello, Osiris,” he says. 

"So the Prince has finally moved,” 
says Osiris. "I suppose I am next” 
"I hope not,” says Vramin. "I 
can personally attest to having 
heard the Prince assure Horus that 
he would not take vengeance upon 
you — in exchange for coopera- 
tion.” 

"Then what has become of Anu- 
bis?” 

"I do not know for certain. Ty- 
phon came here to kill him. I came 
here to clean up after Typhon and 
to hold the Station. Either he has 
slain him and departed, or Anubis 
fled and Typhon followed. So listen 
to me, Osiris. Despite the Prince’s 
assurance, you are in danger. Ty- 
phon is not aware of the Prince’s 
promise, and he was not party to 
it. Having learned, the true story 
from Set herself and having heard 
it confirmed by the Prince, he is 
likely to seek vengeance on the 
wielder of the Hammer — ” 

"Set lives?” 

"Yes, He was known for a time 
as Wakim.” 

"Anubis’s emissary I” 

"None other. The dog had strip- 
ped him of his memories and sent 
him to slay his own son — and fa-

ther. That is what moved Typhon 
to anger.” 

"A pox on the whole bloody 
family! And what has become of 
my son? He but left me this note, 
and — Of course!” 

" ‘Of course/ what?” 

"It is not too late. I — ” 
"Behind you, on the wall!” cries 
yramin. "Typhon!” 

Osiris moves with a speed which 
belies his fragile appearance. He 
dives toward a green tapestry, casts 
it aside and moves/ beyond. 

The shadow flows after him and 
rears. 

When if moves away, there is a 
iTyphon-shaped hole in the tapes- 
try and the wall itself. 


U'T'yphon,” says Vramin. 

^ "I am here,” comes the 
voice ."Why did you give warning?” 
"Because Thoth gave him his 
life.” 


"I was not aware of this.” 

"You did not remain long enough 
to hear it repeated. Now it is too 
late.” 

"No. I fear he has escaped me.” 
"How so?” 

"He was not within the chamber 
when I destroyed it.” 

"This may be a good thing. Lis- 
ten. We can use Osiris.” 

"No! There can never be peace 
between our families so long as he 
lives, regardless of any chivalrous 
sentiments my brother may mouth. 
No. I will search this House until 


I find Osiris and he passes down 
Skagganauk Abyss!” 

"As did Anubis?” 

"No! Anubis has escaped me!” 
comes the cry. "For a time. 

Then Typhon rears; the flames 
come, and he Is gone. 

Vramin makes a daisy-beheading 
gesture with his cane and the win- 
dow is closed. 

"Anubis still lives,” says Mad- 
rak, looking back over his shoul- 
der. 

"Obviously.” 

"What shall we do?” . 

"We shall continue to study the 
functions of the House of the Dead. 
"I wish to rest.” 

"Then do so. Find yourself a near 
chamber and retire. You know 
where the food is.” 

"Yes.” 

"Till later, then.” 

"Till later, Lord.” 

Madrak goes forth from the great 
Hall and he wanders. He comes af- 
ter a time -to a chamber where the 
dead stand like statues. He seats 
himself among them. He speaks. 

"I was his faithful servant. Hear 
mb, lady with the breasts like mel- 
ons. I was his faithful servant. The 
poet went to war with the other 
Angels, knowing it went against 
his will. But he is forgiven and ex- 
alted. And where am I? Servant to 
a servant.” 

It is not fair. 

"Fm glad you agree with me. 
And you there, fellow with the

extra arms. Did you spread reli- 
gion and morality? Did you single- 
handedly defeat monstars and won- 
drous beasts among the unenlight- 
ened?” 

Of course not . 

"So you see.” He slaps his thigh. 
"So you see, there is no justice, 
and virtue is constantly betrayed, 
befouled, imposed upon. Look what 
has become of the General, who 
devoted his life to humanity; Life 
took away his own humanity. Is 
that justice?” 

Hardly. 

"All comes to this, my brothers. 
We all become statues in the House 
of the Dead, regardless of the lives 
we led. The universe never thanks. 
The giver is never repaid. Oh, You 
Who May Be, why did You make 
things to be this way — if You 
did make things, to be this way, 
that is. Why? I have tried to serve 
You and the Prince, Your Agent. 
What’s it gotten me? Coach fare and 
third-class accommodations. I am 
glad that Set battles the Nameless 
without the gauntlet of power — ” 

"What?” 

And looking up, he sees a statue 
which had not been there before; 
and unlike the others, it moves. 

Its head is the head of a black 
dog, and its red tongue darts and 
curls. 

CCX^oul How could you have 
X hidden from Vramin, escap- 
ed T^phon?” 

CREATURES OF DARKNESS 


"This is my House. It will be 
many ages before all its secrets may 
be learned by another.” 

Madrak stands, and his staff 
spins in his hands. 

"I do not fear you, Anubis. I 
have fought it every dime and place 
where man may take the Word. I 
have sent many to this House, and 
I come myself as a conqueror, not 
a victim.” 

"You were conquered long ago, 
Madrak, and you only just now re- 
alized it.” 

"Silence, dog! You speak to one 
who holds your life in his hands.” 
"And you speak to one who 
holds your future in his.” 

"What do you mean?” 

"You said that Set goes to bat- 
tle the Nameless once again?” 
"That is true. And when the 
Nameless has been destroyed, the 
millennium will come.” 

"Ha! Save your metaphysics, 
preacher. Answer me another thing, 
and I will tell you a very good thing 
indeed.” 

"What thing?” 

Anubis steps forward, limp arm 
fluttering at his side. 

"What of the gauntlet of power?" 
"Oh,” says Madrak, removing 
a gauntlet from beneath his dark 
garment and drawing it upon his 
right hand. "When I obtained this 
item, I thought that worlds might 
be won for the faith with it.” It 
reaches to his dbow, his shoulder. 
"I did not know that Wakim was 

143 



Set I was tempted to keep it for 
tnyself. So I substituted my own 
gauntlet-that-grows. If is a com- 
mon enough item in some places 
among the Midworlds. This one 
seems to be of peculiar potency, 
while the other is but ordinary ar- 
mor.” The gauntlet now flares to 
cover his back and his chest 
”1 could kiss thy fat cheeks,” 
says Anubis. "For Set will now 
have less of a Chance against the 
Nameless. And all along you plan- 
ned this betrayall You are a 
shrewder man than I’d supposed, 
Dadl” 

"I was used and I was tempted.” 
"But no more shalt thou be used. 
Oh nol Now you wear the glove, 
and I propose an alliance — ” 
"Back, dogl You’re no better 
than anyone else. I’ve something 
you want now and my backside is 
suddenly kissing sweet. Oh nol 
Whatever I do with my newfound 
power, I do for one person: Mel” 
“The alliance I propose will be 
mutually beneficial.” 

"I need but give the alarm and 
you will be bound so tightly that 
all your guile will not serve to free 
you. I need but spin my staff in 
the proper manner and your brain 
will decorate the walls. So speak 
now with that in mind, fork-tongue, 
and I will listen.” 

"If Osiris still Kves,” says Anu- 
bis, "and if we can’ reach him, then 
we three together may be able to 
destroy Thoth.” 


"I am sure that Osiris still lives 
— though for how much longer this 
will be so, I cannot say. Typhon 
pursues him about the House of 
Life at this moment.” 

"We’ve a chance, a very good 
chance, of recovering all — now 
that you hold the gauntlet. I’ve 
got a way to get us to the House 
of Life, and perhaps a way to res- 
cue Osiris, also.” 

"Then what? We do not even 
know where the battle with the 
Nameless is occurring.” 

"One thing by itself, another 
when if arises. Are you with me?” 
"I’ll go along with you to the 
House of Life, as Thoth desires that 
Osiris live and I may help to 
effect this much of his will. In the 
meantime, I shall be thinking.” 
"That is good enough.” 

((Qee how the gauntlet grows. 

^ Further than before! It is 
down to my thighs this timet” 

" Excellent 1 The more invincible 
you become, the better for us all.” 
"A moment. Do you seriously 
think the three of us can defeat 
Thoth, Set and the Steel General?” 
"Yes.” 

"How?” 

"The Hammer may strike again,” 
says Anubis. 

"It still exists?” 

"Yes, and Osiris is its master.” 
"Well, granting all these things 
and assuming that even yrjimin,

nay be dealt with — what ef the 
bther? What of the great shadow 
Ea the shape of a horse which will 
RursuS us till the end of our days, 
he who does not live in space as 
we know it, who cannot be destroy- 
ed, and who cannot be reasoned 
with when anger lies upon him?” 
Anubis looks away. 

"Typhon do I fear,” he admits. 
"Ages ago I constructed a weapon 
— no, not a weapon, a thing — 
which I thought might serve to re- 
strain him. When I tried to use it 
recently, he fell upon it and de- 
stroyed it. He also took my arm. I 
admit that I have nothing but my 
wit to use against him. But one does 
net throw away an empire for fear 
of one individual. If only I knew 
the secret of his power. ...” 

"I heard him mention Skagga- 
pauk Abyss.” 

"There is no such place.” 

"Fve never heard the name be- 
fore. You have?” 

"Legend, fancy, fiction.” 

And what do these things tell 
of it?” 

"We waste time discussing non- 
sense.” 

"If you wish my assistance, you 
will answer me. See, the gauntlet 
now reaches to my knees 
"Skagganauk Abyss, sometimes 
called the chasm in the sky,” says 
Anubis, "is the place where it is 
said that all things stop and noth- 
ing exists.” 

"There are many very empty 
CREATURES OF OARKNESS 


spaces throughout the universe.” 

"But the Abyss is said to be 
jempty of space, also. It is a bot- 
tomless hole that is not a hole. It 
Is a gap in the fabric of space it- 
sdf. It is nothing. It is the theoreti- 
cal hub of the universe. It is the big 
exit leading nowhere, under, over, 
beyond, out of it all. That’s Skag- 
ganauk Abyss.” 

"Typhon does seem to possess 
Wiese qualities himself, does he 
not?” 

"Yes, he does. I’ll admit that. 
But it answers nothing. Curse the 
mating of Set and Isis! They have 
begotten a brute and a monster!” 

"You can hardly talk, Anubis. 
Was Typhon always as he is now? 
How could the Witch be delivered 
of such a one?” 

"I do not know. He is older than 
I. That whole family is shrouded 
in mystery and paradox. Let us be 
off to the House of Life!” 

Madrak nods his head. 

"Show me the way, Anubis.”

rtTonis walks in the places of 
power, and none know his 
name. But if each among the crea- 
tures which pass were to be ask- 
ed, they would say that they had 
heard something of him. For he is 
a god. His power is almost beyond 
measure. He has been defeated, 
however. The Prince Who Was A 
[Thousand, his brother, worked his 

145 



undoing to preserve his own life 
and the order of life which he rep- 
resents. 

Now, Horus turns up an avenue, 
well lighted, where the various spe- 
cies cavort. Power and the night are 
around him. 

He has come to this particular 
street on this particular world for 
a reason: He is invariably undecid- 
ed. He needs opinions. He loves 
oracles. 

He seeks advice. 

Darkness in the sky, bright lights 
along the thoroughfare. He passes 
places and people of entertain- 
ment. 

A man moves to bar his way. 
He seeks to pass around him, step- 
ping into the street. The man fol- 
lows and seizes his arm. 

Horus glows his breath upon him 
and it comes down with the force 
of a hurricane. The man is swept 
away and Horus moves on . 

After a time, he comes to a place 
of oracles. The Tarot readers and 
the astrologers and the numerolo- 
gists and the casters of the Yi 
Ching beckon to the god in the 
red loin cloth. But he passes them 
by. 

Finally, he comes to a place 
where there are no people. 

It is the place of the machines 
which predict. 

At random, he selects a booth, 
enters. 

"Yes?” inquires the booth. 

"Queries,” Horus replies. 


"A moment.” 

There cames a metallic click, and 
an inner door opens. 

"Enter the cubicle.” 

Horus moves to enter a small 
room. 

It contains a bed, of sorts. A 
heavy female torso lies upon it, 
joined with a gleaming console. A 
speaker is set within the wall. 

"Mount the inquiry unit,” he is 
instructed. 

Discarding his loincloth, Horus 
does this thing. 

The rule is that your questions 
will be answered for so long as you 
give satisfaction,” he is informed. 
"What is it that you wish to 
know?” 

"I have a problem: I find myself 
in conflict with my brother. I tried 
to defeat him. I failed. I cannot 
make up my mind as to whether 
I should seek him out again and 
renew the battle.” 

"Insufficient information to re- 
ply,” comes the answer. "What sort 
of conflict? What sort of brother? 
What sort of man are you?” 

Gruesome grow the lilacs and the 
rose rows be hedges of thorn. The 
garden of memory is filled with 
frantic bouquets. 

"Perhaps I have come to the 
wrong place.” 

"This may be, and it may not. 
Obviously though, you do not know 
the rules.” 

"Rules?” and Horus stares up at 
the dull mesh of the speaker.

IF 



D ry monotone, the voice is sifted 
through: 

”1 am not a seer, nor am I a fore- 
seer. I am an electrical-mechanical 
-biological votary of the god Logic. 
Pleasure is my price, and for it I 
will invoke the god for any man. 
To do so, however, I need a more 
complete question. I do not possess 
sufficient data to answer you at this 
point. So love me, tell me more.” 
"I do not know where to begin,” 
Horus begins. "My brother once 
ruled all things — ” 

"Stop! Your statement is illogi- 
cal, unquantifiable — ” 

"... And quite correct. My 
brother is Thoth, sometimes called 
the Prince Who Was A Thousand. 
One time, all of the Midworlds were 
his kingdom.” 

"My records indicate the ex- 
istence of a myth concerning a 
Lord of Life and Death. Accord- 
ing to the myth, he had no broth- 
ers.” 

Correction. These matters are 
generally kept within the family. 
Isis had three sons, one of them 
by her lawful Lord, Osiris; two of 
them by Set the Destroyer. Unto 
Set she begat Typhon and Thoth. 
Unto Osiris she begat Horus the 
Avenger, myself.” 

"Thou art Horus?” 

"You have named me.” 

"You wish to destroy Thoth?” 
"That was my assigned task.” 
"You cannot do it.” 

"Oh.” 


"Please do not depart. There 
may be more questions you wish 
to ask.” 

"I can’t think of any.” 

But Horus cannot depart at 
this moment, for the fires are upon 
him. 

"What are you?” he finally in- 
quires. 

"I have already told you.” 

"Yet how have you become what 
you are: half-woman, half ma- 
chine?” 

"This is the one question I may 
not answer, unless I am properly 
cued. I shall, however, attempt to 
comfort thee, seeing that thou art 
distraught.” 

"Thank you. You are kind.” 

"It is my pleasure.” 

“I’d say that once you were hu- 
man.” 

"That is correct.” 

"Why did you cease being so?” 
“I may not say, as I have already 
said.” 

"May I help you in any way to 
effect anything which you may de- 
sire?” 

"Yes.” 

"How? 

"I may not say.” 

"Do you know for a fact that 
Horus may not destroy Thoth?” 
"This is the most valid proba- 
bility, based on the knowledge of 
the myths which I possess.” 

"If you were a mortal woman, 
I’d be inclined to be kind to you.” 
"What does that mean?”

"I might love you for your ter- 
Ale honesty. 

"My god, my god! Tliau hast

"What do you mean?” 

"I have been doomed to this ex- 
istence till one who is greater than 
men shall look upon me with love.” 
"I might look upon you in such 
a manner. Would you deem that 
probaUe?” 

"No, for I am too used.” 
"Then you know not the god

"It is the utmost improbability.” 
"But Fve no one else to love. So

"Yes.” 

"Then thou art my Prince, and

"I do not — ”

V ramin walks through the House 
of the Dead. Had you eyes in 
that place, you couldn’t see a thing. 
It is far too dark for eyes to be of 
value. But Vramin can see. 

Me walks through an enormous 
room, and when he reaches a cer- 
tain point within it there comes 
a light that is dim and orange and 
crowded into comers. 

Then they come up out of the 
Inmsparent rectangles which now 

140 


appear in the floor, come up un- 
breathing, unblinking and horizon- 
tal, and they rest upon invisi* 
ble catafalques at a height of two 
feet, and their garments and skins 
are of all colors and their bodies 
of all ages. Now some have wings 
and some have tails, and some have 
horns and some long talons. Some 
have all of these things, and some 
have pieces of machinery built in- 
to them and some do not. 

There comes a moaning and a 
creaking of brittle bones, then 
movement. 

Rustling, clicking, chafing, they 
sit up, they stand up. 

Then all bow down before him, 
and one word fills the air: 

"Master” 

He turns his green eyes upon the 
multitude, and from somewhere a 
sound of laughter comes to fall up- 
on his ears. 

Turning, toning, turning, he 
waves his cane. 

Then there is a sudden movement, 
and she stands by his side. 

"Vramin, your new subjects pay 
you homage.” 

"Lady, how did you get in here?” 

But she laughs again and does 
not answer his question. 

"I, too, have come to honor 
thee: Hail Vramin! Lord of the? 
House of the Dead!” 

"You are kind, Lady.” 

"I am more than kind. The end 
draws near, and that which I de- 
sire is almost at hand.” 


IF 



"It was you who raised these 
dead to rest once more, ami I may 
ask your assistance. I may also 
ask what it is that you desire.” 

“And I may leD you.” 

nphe dead suddenly lie down and 
• descend into their graves. The 
light departs. 

"Do you know why Anubis fled?” 
he inquires. 

"No, I am only just arrived 
here.” 

"He departed, pursued by your 
son Ityphon.” 

And the Red Witch smiles with- 
in her veils. 

"That Typhon lives pleases me 
beyond measure,” she says. 
Where is he now?” 

"Presently, he is seeking the life 
of Osiris. It may be that he has 
already disposed of both the dog 
and the bird.” 

And she laughs, and her familiar 
leaps upon her shoulder mid holds 
its stomach with both hands. 

"How joyous a thing this would 
be — now! We must look upon this 
affairl . 

"Very good,” and .Vramin draws 
a green picture frame upon the 
dark air. 

Isis moves to his side and takes 
his hand in hers. 

Suddenly there is a picture within 
the frame, and it moves. 

It is the picture of a dark horse 
shadow, alone, moving upon a 
walk 


"This is of no help to us,” says 
yramin. 

"No, but it is good to look upon 
my son once again, my son who 
contains the Abyss of Skagganauk 
within him. Where may his brother 
be?” 

With his father, as they have 
gone to fight the Nameless once 
again.” 

And Isis drops her eyes, and the 
picture wavers. 

"I would look upon this thing,” 
she finally says. 

"Before this, I would locate Anu- 
bis and Osiris, if they still live — 
and Madrak.” 

"Very well.” 

And within its emerald frame, 
the picture slowly takes form. 

T Tis arm is around her waist, and 
together they watch the pic- 
tures that form within the frame, 
there in the House Of the Dead. 
They watch Osiris, as he sails across 
the sky in his black crossbow, up 
on which is mounted a thing that 
can smash a sun. He rides alone, 
and the yellow eyes never blink 
within that face which cannot know 
expression. They watch the dark 
cockleshell which contains Anubis, 
Madrak and an empty glove which 
holds power. 

Vramin traces two lines with the 
courses of the vessels. The picture 
changes to the place where the 
lines intersect. There lies the twi- 
light world, and its surface un-

tier goes upheavals as they watch. 

How it is that they could know 
the place?” asks Isis. 

"I do not know — Unless — 
Osiris! He found a note. I watched 
his expression as he read it.” 

"And . ?” 

"Horns. Horus must have left 
him the note — telling him the 
place. ” 

"How could Horus know it?” 

"He fought with Thoth — prob- 
ably within Thoth’s own mind, and 
Horus can look into a man’s head, 
know what he is thinking. Some- 
time during that encounter, he 
must have stolen this knowledge 
from the Prince, who is normally 
proof against such skills. Yes, at 
some time he must have let down 
his guard for an instant. He must 
be warned 1” 

"Perhaps Typhon will yet pro- 
vide for his safety.” 

"Where is Typhon now?” 

They regard the frame and all 
pictures flee. 

Black, black, black. There is 

nothing. 

"It is as though Typhon does 
not exist,” says Vramin. 

"No,” says Isis. "You look upon 
Skagganauk the Abyss. Typhon has 
withdrawn from the universe, to 
sad: his own way along the un- 
dersides of space as men know it. 
It may be that he, too, has found 
'whatever note Horus left.” 

"This is not sufficient insurance 
lor the Prince. The whole project 

lit 


may miscarry unless we can reach 
him.” 

"Then go to him quickly!” 

"I cannot.” 

"One of your famous gateways.” 
"They only function within the 
Midworlds. I draw my power from 
the tides. I cannot operate beyond. 
Lady, how did you come here?” 
"In my chariot.” 

"Of the Ten Invisible Powers?” 
"Yes.” 

"Then let us use it.” 

"I fear — Listen, Mage. You 
must understand. I am a woman 
and I love my son, but I also love 
my life. I am afraid. I fear the 
place of that conflict. Do not think 
the less of me if I refuse to accom- 
pany you. You may take my char- 
iot and you may ride in it, but you 
must keep your own company.” 

"I think not the less of you, 
Lady.” 

"Then take this pendant. It con- 
trols the Ten Powers that drive the 
chariot, and it will give you addi- 
tional strengths.” 

"Will it function beyond the Mid- 
worlds?” 

"Yes,” and she slides into his 
arms and for a moment his green 
beard tickles her neck while her 
familiar gnashes its tiny teeth and 
knots its tail, twice. 

Then she conducts him to her 
chariot on the roof of the House of 
the Dead, and he mounts If, holds 
high the pendant in his right hand,

cleverly contrived tableau within a 
red-glass bottle, is then a distant 
twinkle in the heavens Isis watches. 

Shuddering, she retreats to the 
{daces of the dead, to dwell again 
upon the one whom she fears to 
face, who is even now battling the 
Nameless. 

Suramin stares ahead with eyes 
of jade. Points of yellow light dance 
within them. 

ehind Vramin’s eyes is the vision 
distilled. 

[There stands the Prince, down- 
ward staring. The surface of the 
world’s afire. On the hood of the 
Prince’s ship stands the beast whose 
body is armor, whose rider sits un- 
moving, gleaming, also facing the 
place of conflict The crossbow ap- 
proaches. The cockleshell swings 
forward. The Hammer is cocked, 
snaps forward. Then rag-tail ablaze, 
the comet comes forth, glowing, 
brightening as it races onward. 

Somewhere, a banjo is plucked as 
Bronze rears and the head of the 
General swivels over his left shoul- 
der to face the intruder. His left 
hand jerks toward him and Bronze 
continues to rear, up onto his hind- 
most legs and then springs away 
from the Prince’s vessel. Three 
strides only are taken. Mount and 
rider vanish. There comes a hazi- 
ness, a crinkling, and the stars 
dance in that corner of the sky, as 
though they are reflections within 
an agitated pool. The comet is

caught up in this wind that is 
Change, becomes two-dimensional, 
is gone. Pieces of the broken cross- 
bow continue on along the path 
the vessel had followed when whole. 
[The cockleshell heads toward the 
surface of the world, vanishes amid 
the smoke and the dust, the flames. 
For a long while, the entire tableau 
is a still-life. Then the cockleshell 
streaks away. It now contains three 
occupants. 

Vramin tightens his hand upon 
the piece of bloody light, and the 
Chariot of Ten turns to pursue. 

The conflict rages upon the sur- 
face of the planet. The globe seems 
a liquid and boiling thing, chang- 
ing shape, spurting forth fiery foun- 
tains. There comes a series of enor- 
mous blazes and a mighty shatter- 
ing. The world comes apart. There 
is brightness, mighty, mighty, and 
dust, confusion: fragmentation. 

Behind the jade eyes of Yramin, 
within which dances the yellow 
lights, there is this vision. 

IV 

YJ-ands clasped behind his back, 
i' * A the Prince Who Was a Thou- 
sand considers the destruction of 
the world. 

The broken body of the world, 
its members splintered and crushed, 
rotates beneath him, flattening, 
elongating, burning, binning, burn- 
ing. 

Now he watches through an in- 

151 




strument as he orbits about the 
ruin, an instrument like a pink lor- 
gnette with antennae. Occasionally, 
tkere is a click and the antennae 
twitch. He lowers it, raises it again, 
several times. Finally, he puts it 
aside. 

"What is it that you see, my 
brother?” 

He turns his head, and the dark 
horse shadow is at his side. 

"I see a living point of light, 
caught up in that mass down there,” 
he says. "Twisted, shrunken, weak- 
ly pulsing, but still alive. Still liv- 
ing.” 

"Then our father has failed.” 

"I fear so.” 

"This thing must not be.” 

And Typhon is gone. 


Then it is framed in flame. 

Nothing lies within the blazing 
silhouette. Nothing whatsoever. 

Then the flames subside and the 
shadow shrinks, retreating, retreat- 
ing, running down a long, absolute- 
ly empty corridor. 

Then there is nothing. 

It is as if the world had never 
existed. It is gone, finished, kaput, 
and the Nameless Thing That Cries 
in the Night along with it. And 
now, Typhon, too, is gone. 

A line comes into Vramin’s head: 
"Die Luft ist kuhl und es dunkelt, 
und ruhig fliest den Rhein.” He 
remembers not the source, but 
knows the feeling. 

Bloodbolt held on high, he pur- 
sues the god of death. 


^Tow, as Vramin pursues the 

\ cockle of Anubis, he sees the 
thing for which there is no under- 
standing. 

Upon the blasted heap of ele- 
ments that was a world there comes 
now a dark spot. It grows, amidst 
the light, the dust, the confusion, 
grows until its outline becomes dis- 
cernable: 

It is a dark horse shadow that 
has fallen upon the rubble. 

It continues to grow until it 
achieves the size of a continent. 

Rearing, the dark horse is ram- 
pant over all. It swells, it expands, 
it lengthens, until the wreckage of 
the entire planet is contained with- 
in it.

, A wakening, slowly, manacled 
spread-eagle fashion to a steel 
table, bright lights stabbing down 
through his yellow eyes like electric 
needles within his brain, Set groans 
softly and tests the strength of his 
bonds. 

His armor is gone, that pale glow 
in the corner might be the star 
wand, his shoes that walk upon 
everything are not to be seen. 

"Hello, Destroyer,” says the 
wearer of the glove. "You are for- 
tunate to have survived the en- 
counter.” 

"Madrak?” he asks. 

"Yes.”

"I can’t see you. Those lights — ” 
"Fm standing behind you, and 
those lights are only for purposes 
of preventing your use of temporal 
fugue to depart this vessel before 
we are ready to permit it.” 

”1 do not understand.” 

"The battle waxeth furious be- 
low. I am watdiing it through a 
port now. It looks as if you have 
the upper hand. In a moment, the 
Hammer that Smashes Suns will 
strike again, and you will of course 
escape it as you did the last time 
— by means of the fugue. That is 
why we were able to pick you up a 
few moments ago, just as Anubis 
did in days long gone by. The fact 
that you did appear testifies to 
what will happen shortly. There! 
Osiris strikes, and the Hammer be- 
gins its descent — Anubis! Some- 
thing is wrong! There is some sort 
of change occurring! The Hammer 
is . is * . gone. ...” 

"Yes, I see it now,” comes the 
familiar bark. “And Osiris, too, has 
gone away. The Steel General, he 
it was.” 

"What shall we do now?” 
"Nothing. Nothing whatsoever. 
This turn is even better than we 
had hoped. Set’s occurrence recently 
by means of the fugue testifies that 
some cataclysmic event will still 
shortly occur. Does it not, Set?” 
"Yes.” 

"Your final clash will doubtless 
destroy the world.” 

“Probably. I didn’t stay.” 


"Yes, there it goes,” says Mad- 
rak. 

“Wonderfull Now we have Set; 
Osiris has been disposed of, and 
the Steel General is no longer avail- 
able to pursue us. We have Thoth 
precisely where we want him. Hail 
Madrak, new Lord of the House of 
Life!” 

"Thank you, Anubis. I didn’t 
think it could be that easily accom- 
plished — but what of the Name- 
less?” 

"Surely it must have fallen this 
time. What of it, Set?” 

"I don’t know. I struck it with 
the full force of the wand.” 

"Then everything is tied up 
neatly. Now hear me, Set. We wish 
you no ill, nor will we harm your 
son Thoth. We rescued you when 
we could have left you to rot — ” 
"Then why have you secured me 
thus?” 

"Because I know your temper 
and your power, and I wished to 
reason with you before freeing you. 
You might not have granted me 
sufficient opportunity, so I insured 
it myself. I wish to deal with Thoth 
through you — ” 

"Lord!” cries Madrak. "Observe 
the ruined world! There comes over 
it a monstrous shadow 1” 

"It is Typhon!” 

"Yes. What can he be doing?” 
"What do you know of this, 
Set?” 

"It means that I failed, and that

Typhon is completing the job.” 
"There is fire, master, and — 
I cannot look upon the emptiness 
which occurs!” 

"Skagganauk Abyss!” 

CC^es,” says Set. "Typhon is 
- * -Skagganauk Abyss. He evicts 
the Nameless from the universe.” 
"What was the Nameless?” 

"A god,” says Set, "an old god, 
Pm sure, with nothing left to be 
dime about any more.” 

"I do not understand,” says 
Madrak. 

"He jests. But what of Typhon? 
How shall we deal with him?” 
"You may not have to,” says 
Set. "What he has done has prob- 
ably resulted in his own exile from 
the universe.” 

"Then we have won, Anubis! We 
have won! Typhon was the only 
thing you feared, was he not?” 
"Yes. Now the Midworlds lie 
for ever within my hands.” 

And mine, don’t forget!” 

"Of course not. So tell me, Set. 
You see the ways the stars are 
drifting. Will you join with us? 
You will become the right hand of 
Anubis. Your son can be a Re- 
gent. He may name his own job, 
for I do not undervalue his wis- 
dom. What say you?” 

"I must think of this thing.” 

"To be sure. Take your time. 
Realize, however, that I am now 
invincible.” 


"And you realize that I have de- 
feated God in battle.” 

"It could not have been God,” 
says Madrak, "or He would not 
have been defeated 1” 

"No,” says Set. "You saw Him at 
the end. You witnessed His power. 
And even now He is not dead, 
only in exile.” 

Madrak lowers his head, covers 
his face with his hands. 

"I do not believe you! I cannot.” 
"But it is true, and you have 
been party to this thing, oh recre- 
ant priest, blasphemer, apostate!” 
"Silence, Set!” cries Anubis. 
"Don’t listen to him, Madrak. He 
sees your weakness, as he sees the 
Weaknesses of all things he en- 
counters. He seeks to draw you on- 
to a battlefield of another sort, 
one where you struggle against 
yourself, to be beaten by the guilt 
he has contrived for you. Ignore 
him!” 

"But what if he speaks the truth? 
I stood by and did nothing — even 
profited by — ” 

"Indeed you did,” says Set. "The 
guilt is mainly mine, but I bear it 
with pride. You were party to the 
action,; however. You stood by and 
watched, thinking of the profit 
that would come to you, while He 
whom you served was beaten to 
His knees — ” 

Anubis strikes him a terrible 
blow that rips the flesh of his 
cheek. 

"I take it that you have made up

swer: To try to turn Madrak 
against me. If will not work. He 
is not so gullible as you think — 
are you, Dad?” 

Madrak does not answer, but 
continues to stare out the port. 
Set struggles against his bonds but 
cannot loosen them. 

"Anubisl We are pursued I” 

Anubis departs Set’s side, van- 
ishing into darkness. The lights 
continue to stab downward. 

"It is the Chariot of Ten,” Anu- 
bis says. 

"Of the Lady Isis?” Madrak 
inquires. "Why should she follow 
US?” 

"Because Set was once her be- 
loved. Perhaps he still is. Eh, Set? 
What’s the story?” 

But Set does not reply. 

"Whatever,” says Madrak, "it 
draws nears. How strong is the 
Red Witch? Will she give us trou- 
ble?” 

"She was not so strong but that 
she feared her old Lord, Osiris, 
avoiding him for many centuries — 
and I am certainly as strong as 
Osiris. We will not be beaten by a 
woman. Not when we have come 
this far.” 

M adrak bows his head, mumbl- 
ing, and begins to beat upon 
his breast. 

"Stop that I You’re bong ridicu- 
lous!” 

But Set laughs, and Anubis turns 
156 


upon him with a savage snarl. 

"I’ll tear your heart out for 
that!” 

But Set raises his bleeding left 
hand which he has just tom free 
and holds it before his body. 

"Try if, dogl Your one hand 
against mine. Your staff and any 
other weapon you have against the 
left hand of Set. Come closer 1” 
And his eyes glow like twin suns 
and Anubis falls back beyond his 
grasp. 

The lights continue to dazzle and 
6pin. 

" Rill him Madrakl” cries Anu- 
bis. "He is of no further use to us! 
You wear the gauntlet of power! 
He cannot stand against it!” 

But Madrak does not reply, in- 
stead, "Forgive me, Whatever You 
Are or Were, Wherever You May or 
May Not Be, for omissions and 
commissions in which I indulged or 
did not indulge, as the' gase may 
be, in this matter which has just 
come to pass,” he says, still beating 
his breast. "And in the event 
that — » 

"Then give me the glove!” cries 
Anubis. "Quickly!” 

But Madrak continues. 

A shudder runs through the cock- 
leshell,. and magicians and poets be- 
ing very good at that sort of thing, 
a doorway which had been doubly 
sealed springs open, and Kramin 
enters. 

He waves his cane and smiles. 

"How do?, How do?,”

"Take him, Madrakl” cries 
Anubis. 

But yramin advances, and Mad-

bling. 

[Then Anubis raises his staff be- 
fore him. 

“Angel of the Seventh Station, 
and fallen, depart!” says Anubis. 

“You use my old title,” says 
Yramin. “I am now Angel of the 
House of the Dead.” 

“You lie ” 

“No. By appointment of the 
Prince do I now occupy your for- 
ma: position.” 

With a great wrenching move- 
ment, Set frees his right hand. 

Yramin dandles Isis’s pendant be- 
fore him, and Anubis backs away. 

“Madrak, I bid you destroy this 
one!” he cries out. 

“yramin?” says Madrak. “OH, 
no, not Vramin. He is good. He 
is my friend.” 

Set frees his right ankle. 

“Madrak, if you will not destroy 
yramin, then hold Set!” 

“ ‘Thou Who might be our Fa- 
ther who perhaps may be in Heav- 
en. ... * ” Madrak intones. 

[Then Anubis snarls and points 
his staff like a bazooka at yramin. 

“Come no further,” he announces. 

But Yramin advances another 
step. 

A blaze of light falls upon him, 
but the red beams from the pendant 
cancel it out. 

“Too late, dog,” he says.

Anubis circles, draws near the 
port where Madrak stands. 

Set frees his left ankle, rubs it, 
stands. 

“You are dead,” says Set, and 
moves forward. 

But at this moment, Anubis falls 
to the knife of Madrak, which (en- 
ters his neck above the collar bone. 

“I meant no harm,” says Mad- 
rak, “and this is to pay in part 
for my guilt. The dog led me astray. 
I repent. I make you a gift of his 
life.” 

“Thou fool!” says Yramin. “I 
wanted him prisoner.” 

Madrak begins to weep. 

Anubis bleeds in red spurts up- 
on the floor of the cockleshell. 

Set lowers his head slowly and 
rubs his eyes. 

“What shall we do now?” asks 
Yramin. 

“ ‘Hallowed be Thy name, if a 
name Thou hast and any desire to

Set does not answer, having 
closed his eyes and fallen into a

Dear Editor: 

Isaac Asimov’s The Holmes-Gins- 
book Device (Dec. If) was a dam 
funny story, which makes me wish 
that the Good Doctor would do more 
writing, other than science-populari- 
zation. But, on the first page of the 
story, the narrator says, “Mike Gins- 
book was bom on Jan. 1, 2001, which 
made him exactly as old as this 
century.” I beg to differ with Dr. 
Asimov, but if Ginsbook had indeed 
been born on the 1st of January, in 
2001, he would be exactly one year 
less than the age of that century 
(i.e., in 2035 Ginsbook would be 
34 years old.) So he must have 
been bom Jan. 1, 2000. 

Was that a typographical error, 
or did My Hero goof? - 

Mack Reynolds’s serial The Com- 
puter Conspiracy was a very good 
novel. But I am puzzled about one 
thing. I am damn sure that this 
story is the latest in a (more or less) 
series about such things as Inalien- 
able Basic, teevee wrist phones and 
the wilds of Brooklin (or is it Man- 
hatan?) which all seem to stem from 
am If First by the name of Bircher, 
that was published a year or so ago. 


But Mack Reynolds (I am fairly 
sure) has been around a lot longer 
than a year or two. Where did I 
go wrong? Did my memory circuits 
blow a gasket or what? 

Two final questions: Whatever 
happened to the If policy of over- 
lapping serials (I miss them)? And 
whatever happened to the novels by 
Robert Heinlein you used to print 
every now and then (I miss them 
too)? 

If If continues to be such a fine 
magazine, it will make a clean sweep 
of the Hugo field for FOUR straight 
years (at least as long as MY vote 
has anything to say about it. — ) !!! — 
James A. Juracic, P O Box 11, Fruit- 
vale, B.C., Canada. 

• No goof. Figure it for yourself. 
There was no Year Zero, so Janu- 
ary 1st of the year 1 was the first 
day of the first century; January 1st 
of the year 2001 will be the first 
day of the twenty-first century; and 
so on through the ages. Asimov 
make a mistake? You must be kid- 
ding! 

About Mack Reynolds: Yes, he’s 
been around quite a while, and isn’t 
the author of Bircher — different 


159 


story, different writer. Heinlein: He’s 
still building his super-house, but 
signs are he may soon be getting 
back to novels — at which time we 
hope to get back to bringing them 
to yon. Overlapping serials: We stop- 
ped overlapping them because we 
couldn’t find enough good serials 
to keep it up. Writers move in cycles, 
like lemmings. It looks like the mi- 
gration is toward good serials again, 
so maybe we’ll be able to overlap 

them again before long. — Editor .

Dear Editor: 

1) Before all else, let me add 
my congratulations to the multitude’s 
on the occasion of the award to 
Worlds of If of the Hugo for the 
third consecutive year! This honey of 
praise should sweeten the gullet be- 
fore the gall of stricture, here followi 
ing, is sipped. Look not behind you 
to see of the pursuit, nor linger to 
bask In favor’s warmth, for, know 
that always the competitions’ chop- 
pers gnash at your heels. A pseudo- 
archaic touch of Howard or Edison 
Marshall may well lubricate the ac- 
companying rude shaft of criticism. 

2) While this writer does, in 
truth, admire your successful elects 
cism as editor in selecting (and, no 
doubt, amending) the contents of 
Worlds of If, the mechanical and 
substantiate aspects of the maga- 
zine apparently have not had your 
full attention. ITEM: 1) In the 
December, 1968 issue (not even read 
in full as yet) mechanical errors 
abound typographically as evinced on 
pages 81, 82, and 83 to exhaust not 
the list. As for substantiation, ITEM: 
2) In the fast-paced, thought-pro- 


voking and well-enjoyed serial The 
Computer Conspiracy, its author 
Mack Reynolds, an omnivorous auto- 
didact by all the signs, states most 
inaccurately on page 126 that the 
Esperanto phrase venu rapide means 
(page 127) kill him . Not so. The 
significance of these two words is 
come quickly; to achieve the d esired 
merely shout lin mortigu! ITEM: 3) 
On page 133 Reynolds asserts incor- 
rectly that Hungarian’s sole linguistic 
relative in Europe is Finnish. Not so. 
Not affluent perhaps, but an indu- 
bitable relative (cognate, even, to 
Finnish) is Estonian. And some 
would add, as second cousin perhaps, 
Turkish which retains a small but 
definite toehold in Europe. All these 
last could have been precluded by an 
glert researcher through a phone call 
or three to some knowledgable source 
|Ight there in mighty, if slowly de-i 
composing. New York. Now, it is not 
suggested that in addition to your 
other duties you assume directly those 
of proofreader and researcher (but 
then, why not?!); however, as editor, 
you are responsible for all literary 
material appearing in your maga- 
zine, and therefore you should ex- 
ercise a firmer control over its ap-> 
pearance and content — as a mat- 
ter of your editorial reputation, if 
nothing else, don’t you agree? 

3) Alas, in most laurel wreaths are 
concealed a few thorns. If moved 
thereto, hopefully a few more of 
the former could appear in the fu- 
ture from your scabrous, but loyal 
subscriber — R. C. Marble, P O 
Box 545, Reseda, California 91335. 
• Mea culpa. Esteemed Subscriber. 
Typographical vicissitudes (and auc- 


IF 


160 



tonal misdemeanors) inevitably re- 
dound discreditably to redactive rep- 
utations. Yet pari passu, what is one 
to do when previously normative par-> 
ameters enter a heteroscedastic phase?

Dear Editor: 

“Science-fiction/’ it says here on 
the cover of //. So what’s Creatures 
of Light, a fantasy by Roger Zelazny, 
doing here? I don’t like fantasy, like 
religion, it is the product of human 
imagination with no basis in fact. 
That’s where religion came from. If 
1 want to read fantasy I’ll read the 

BiUe. — Roger Frohn,

Dear Editor: 

Mack Reynolds, an entertaining 
author and constructor of ingeni^ 
ous tales, needs some editorial as- 
sistance. 

He is obsessed with the idea that 
proper development of his characters 
requires “Cuteness” and a slang to 
which he tries to impute currency: 
Zoroaster, trank, wizard, chum-pal, 
fuaker, whisdin Dixie, lush, guzzle, 
ddL Some are his and some are bor- 
rowed, and none are good. 


If he must use such blunt tools, 
he should at least research thorn to 
the extent of observing their short- 
ness of span in real life. 

Can’t yon help him? and me? — 
W. F, Poynter, 1200 Monterey Bou- 
levard, San Francisco, California 
94127.

Dear Editor: 

Since you read all the stories sub- 
mitted and decide which stories are to 
be published (as you state in Hue 
& Cry ) exactly what do the Manag- 
ing and Associate Editors do? I had 
always thought that they screened 
the stories first and sent die best 
to you for final selection. 

I bought Worlds of Fantasy . It’s 
excellent. More, please! — Fred F. 
Jackson ID, 289 Ddlwood, Pontiac, 
Michigan 48053. 

• What do they do? Why they do 
all the hard work, of course — proof- 
reading, manuscript editing, dealing 
with artists, etc„ while The Editor 
lounges at his ease, eating chocolates 
and reading stories. R.H.I.P . —

IF 



PITY THE POOR READER! 


We’ve heard the sad story over and over at science-fiction 
meetings. Some reader was right in the middle of one of our 
award-winning serials when his magazine dealer goofed, and 
he missed an issue. Or he found the stand all sold out and 
never read the novelette every other fan is raving about now. 

Naturally, nobody wants to miss an issue of IF— the magazine 
that won the Hugo as Best in the field at the past two World 
Science Fiction Conventions. And surely nobody will want to 
miss the great stories and brand new features we are already 
scheduling for the future issue of IF. 

We try to make sure there are enough copies for every reader, 
but we can’t guarantee that you won’t miss an issue, un- 
fortunately. 

Only you can do that. And it's really quite simple and will even 
save you money. Just fill in the coupon below— or if you hate 
to mutilate the magazine, write the information on a sheet of 
plain paper— and mail it today! Then nobody will pity you, 
because you’ll be sure of getting every vital issue of IF!
