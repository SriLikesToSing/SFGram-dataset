EDITORIAL 

OUR UNDER-ACHIEVING UNIVERSE 

“We could land a man on the Moon, if we wanted to. We really 
could.” In 1940 such sentiments were considered quite literally lunatic. 
By 1950 they were merely crackpot. By 1960 they were visionary. 
Now, of course, they are History. 

We could terraform Venus, if we wanted to. 

Or put factories — and farms! — in orbit, thus precipitating the Third 
Industrial Revolution. Or change the traditional three-score-and-ten to a 
hundred happy, healthy, robust years. We could begin work on un- 
manned probes to the nearer stars. That’s in the short run. In the long 
run we can do — Anything! 

But we don’t. Instead we pull in our horns, walk and think small, 
figure out the least uncomfortable techniques for dying-by-inches. And 
why? Because our meagre-minded “leaders” (of Right and Left, by 
God!) are incapable of grasping even the idea of an open-ended future. 
Willy-nilly we are all committed to a short-term survival strategy of 
playing it safe; the surest long-term recipe for disaster. 

So we spend billions piled upon billions for fleets of fighter-bombers 
that are obsolete before they are on-line: when we could be building 
Space Shuttles capable of carrying clusters of MIRVs — and of initiating 
the Age of Space as well. So we spend more billions ( lots more bil- 
lions) on an anti-ICBM missile system that is phased out as worthless 
i almost before it becomes operational: when we could for the same 
| money have created a laser anti-ICBM system that would have 
I worked — and also have enabled us to pop payloads into orbit for 
pennies-per-pound. And let’s not forget our incredible bureaucracy that 
j somehow consumes kilo-billions not delivering social services: guess 
how much cheaper — and more nourishing! — it would be to give food- 
stamp recipients food instead. And so on. All it takes is a little vision in 
] high places, and we can fulfill our short-term goals while we win for 
j ourselves a Universe. 

Well, 1976 is an Election Year. Perhaps there are a few would-be 
J occupants of said high places who are capable of entertaining visionary 
ideas — even crackpot or lunatic ones. And making them History. 

C’mon: let’s terraform Venus!

GALAXY 




The fast-breeder reactor may be the answer to our 
current energy problems: but what might be the 
answer to — 




I 

In his ninth existence he was an 
SS-guard at the infamous Herms- 
berg and acquired a heavy karmic 
debt. 

In those days his name was Hel- 
mut Schweinhirt and in appearance 
he was chunky, blond, wide-faced, 
and steady. 

On the cosmic scale, his 
Schweinhirt incarnation was already 
well above the average. Slowly he 
had grown in consciousness choos- 
ing ever more alert and discriminat- 
ing parents. The Schweinhirt elders 
were peasants, but of the enterpris- 
ing kind. Mutti ran a small vegeta- 
ble shop supplied from Vati's sub- 
urban land where everything was 
raised by the most modem methods. 

Helmut was well on his way up 
the ladder of awareness when the 
war came with its irresistible temp- 
tations. The chaotic, psychic mael- 
strom caught him up and carried 
him along — from home to barracks to 
parade ground to Hermsberg, and 
he lived the evanescent dream of 
racial superiority for a second or 
two of eternal duration. 


In the small room he rented near 
the concentration camp (Hermsberg 
was new and there were no barracks 
initially), he had two lamps shaded 
by tatooed human skin. Underneath 
the heavy, lumpy mattress of his 
narrow bed, in a small blue sack, 
he collected gold teeth and other 
curiosities. 

Helmut was not unusually cruel 
or sadistic with the exception of one 
case, which would prove his undo- 
ing for some centuries to come. But 
he allowed himself to be carried 
away by the breathless lust of his 
comrades, a lust for violence which 
came and went in pulses over the 
camp, the consequence of frustra- 
tion, ennui, guilt, and fear. Then he 
too joined in the beatings and tram- 
plings of newly arrived Underhu- 
mans. 

The temptation that would indi- 
rectly cost him his life some time 
later came one winter morning in 
the form of a father and his daugh- 
ter. The father was a poet or lawyer 
or doctor, an inordinately tall fi- 
gure, though a little stooped. He 
had curly salt-and-pepper hair; 
large, dark, watery eyes; and fin- 
gers of exceeding length. His eyes 
were mournful and heavy with 
awareness. 

Helmut met the pair upon arrival, 
mingled in with others in a long 
stream of people reaching back to 
the cattle cars. In the reception hall 
men and women were split into 
separate groups, and Helmut stood 
there with several others amidst the 
odors of disinfectant, pushing the 
people along, making them move 
on, move on. A disturbance in 
another room called away the NCO 
in charge. During that unsupervised

GALAXY 



moment, Helmut approached the tall 
jew’s daugher — she stood quite near 
him, eyes on the rough concrete 
floor — and he more or less forced 
her to yield up a kiss or two while 
his hands ranged indecently over 
her tits and under her skirt. She 
struggled fiercely. 

She was something of a rarity in 
Hermsberg — a beauty. Bosomy, 
languid-eyed, long-lashed, and soft. 
Her skin and bearing spoke of silks 
and laces and recently lost wealth. 
Such as she seldom made it into 
this line. They were diverted to 
‘domestic service’ in the homes of 
higher-ups. She would also be dis- 
covered, as Helmut knew quite 
well, and he wanted to get a feel of 
her while he had a chance. 

Across the room the tall jew 
broke from the line so swiftly that 
the guards — who smirkingly en- 
joyed Helmut’s antics with the 
pretty jewess — had no time to re- 
strain him. He came in giant strides 
across the room, dark eyes burning, 
a little stooped. His exceedingly 
long, fine fingers grasped Helmut’s 
blond locks, knocking Helmut’s cap 
askew. He jerked back Helmut’s 
head. Helmut yelled in pain and let 
go of the soft female. He turned to 
the tall jew with fury. The jew, still 
holding Helmut’s hair, hit him 
across the face with a free hand — 
once, twice, three times. Guards 
grabbed the jew and dragged him 
away. 

All day long his fellow guards 
teased Helmut about his humilia- 
tion. That night he sat alone in the 
light of a tatooed lamp and brooded 
with a book on his lap. The book 
dealt with infantry tactics, knowledge 
he would soon need. But he didn’t 

PLUTONIUM 


read and didn’t learn. He brooded 
about vengeance and about the soft 
jewess whose faint, sweet scent still 
seemed to cling to his cheek. She was 
. .she seemed. Oh, he didn’t 
really know. She seemed so 
familiar to him. Kissing her had been 
the most natural thing in the world. 

* * + 

He soon succeeded in being as- 
signed to a land-clearing party that 
included the tall jew. Decades later 
Hermsberg would be the site of a 
uranium mine, its product moving 
to Russia. Now it was a tiny vil- 
lage, a concentration camp, and a 
road in process of being built 
through forest. The land-clearing 
work had to do with that road. 

Outdoor duty was not exactly 
sought. Winter advanced on every 
front with snow and frost. Even 
bundled up in a heavy jacket and 
wearing a woolen cap beneath the 
helmet, a man froze out there, on 
the stony, icy ground. Mitted hands 
had to be slapped and boots had to 
be stamped to keep up the circula- 
tion in the extremities. The breath 
vapored whitely. The moisture froze 
in the nose. But Helmut felt no re- 
gret. He restored his German man- 
hood methodically, repaying the 
slaps he had received with interest. 

They spent some weeks together 
in cruel union. The man’s name 
was Mahler, and he came from Ber- 
lin. Until this time those sensitive 
long fingers of his had never 
grasped anything more substantial 
than a pen. Now they were obliged 
to swing a pickaxe against soil so 
hard sparks seemed- to fly from the 
contact of metal and earth. At any 

7 



moment a blow might strike him 
from the side or from behind de- 
livered with the stock of a rifle. 
Sometimes a kick sent him sprawl- 
ing and his unprotected, gloveless, 
frozen hands bled when he rose, 
trembling from cold and malnutri- 
tion. Helmut’s wide face and steady 
eyes would stare at him with satis- 
fied menace. 

“Eines Tages, kleiner Helmut , 
eines Tages ..." Mahler would 
murmur with mournful eyes. The 
words mean, "One of these days, 
little Helmut, one of these days 
. ...” He said them knowing that 
more blows Would follow, said 
them wanting blows. Mahler longed 
for an end to his miseries. Blows, 
kicks, cold, hatred, indigestible 
food, savage work in frozen 
wilderness — all these would speed 
him to that eternal nothingness 
which would follow the dissolution 
of this wretched biological accident 
called Mahler. 

The girl’s name was Eva. Much 
as Helmut had suspected, she had 
been segregated from the rest, had 
disappeared into the quarters of a 
major. To know her there, in some- 
one else’s arms, aroused him to 
cold fury, and that fury left him in 
the form of kicks and blows 
and cruelties, until Herr Mahler 
could no longer work and lay 
supine on his flat straw, dead for all 
intents and purposes except for a 
dark shining in his eyes. 

By the mysterious channels of 
communication that transcended all 
barriers between gentile and jew, 
word of her father’s treatment fi- 
nally reached Eva. Abruptly Helmut 
found himself with orders to the 
Russian front. 


It happened on the outskirts of 
Stalingrad. Helmut was running for 
cover past the face of a low- 
squatting peasant hut when a tiny, 
wizened, wrinkled old fellow — he 
was clearly an old jew with a tall 
black hat and sideburns curly at the 
ends — appeared around the end of 
the building. Helmut hesitated for a 
second, and that hesitation was 
enough. He was caught by a 
plaster-blasting string of machine- 
gun bullets and fell face down on 
the ground. The final vision of his 
incarnation was that of Eva’s angry, 
frightened eyes when he had vio- 
lently sought the parted softness of 
her lips. 

* * ★ 

He found himself in dimension- 
less paradise, a play of light and 
energies. Hurricanes of force caught 
and carried him. He struggled and 
fought, panicked, disoriented, and 
discovered that he had no arms to 
wave about, nothing tangible attach- 
ing to his free awareness. Terror 
grasped him. For a timeless moment 
he remembered all his lives, saw 
Eva in many incarnations, always 
his, always together, meant for each 
other, joined eternally. But this time 
he had lost her. The gradually as- 
cending curve of his karma sud- 
denly sagged in his German life, 
heavy with debt. He sucked 
nonexistent breath into nonexistent 
lungs. 

I will do good, he thought. I’ll 
pay it all back with a life of ser- 
vice. 

At this thought a brightness 
formed above him, a brilliant light 
somewhere in that space that had no 


8 


GALAXY 



‘where’ and was no ‘space.’ A cir- 
cle of light. It seemed to have a 
face, seemed to resemble the wrin- 
kled old jew. It shone. The light 
frightened him, made him recoil. 
He turned, in a manner of speaking, 
toward the separated red of the 
spectrum around that disc of bril- 
liance. He turned farther, toward a 
purple, and then images began to 
form and lift from a gathering dark- 
ness. 

He saw America, the New 
World. He knew it was America al- 
though at first it was nothing more 
than a vast continental darkness 
with a scatter of light along the 
coasts and here and there inland. 
From that sprinkled darkness a dark, 
chtonic force rose and pulled him 
down. On twenty million beds, car- 
seats, haypiles, floors, couches 
. forty million Americans 
copulated on this Wednesday 
night — naked, half-naked, and al- 
most fully clothed — in the manner 
of the two-backed beast, like dogs, 
side by side, and in unspeakable 
poses. 

Desire! 

He fell into the tornado of desire 
down below, drawn by mysterious 
forces, once more nearly encased in 
time but not yet securely material. 
His entire being longed for material- 
ity, burned to participate in the 
creative act. But he wouldn’t plunge 
in just anywhere. He sought among 
these copulators for cleanliness and 
innocence, for decency and right- 
eousness, impelled away from the 
petty horror that had been his last 
life. 

A dark-purple force-stream 
guided him in a westerly direction. 
The rising vibrations were benevo- 

PLUTONIUM 


lent as he descended. He plunged in 
precisely at the moment of impreg- 
nation, was the impregnation, his 
soul-force adding the tiny increment 
of energy the tailed semen needed 
to penetrate the giant ovum’s resis- 
tant skin. 

His mom and dad lay side by 
side, still breathing hard after the 
exertions of love, when the entity 
known as Helmut Schweinhirt — its 
cast-off body stiffening slowly 
against a Russian wall — dissolved in 
childish bliss and lost its memories. 

* * * 

The choice of the Clark identity 
turned out felicitous. To all appear- 
ances, the bad karma had been 
eradicated or would soon be dis- 
placed by the cumulations of ser- 
vice. 

John Clark grew up an all- 
American boy, son of a machinist 
in Oklahoma city. He had a paper 
route and later stocked groceries. In 
high school he played on the bas- 
ketball team, but in college he 
worked in the cafetaria to make a 
go of it. By sheer application he 
acquired the only kind of degree a 
man of service would choose in his 
day and age — he became an en- 
gineer. A series of jobs eventually 
led to the Corps of Engineers, and 
from there, through the linkage of 
friends, he joined a newly formed 
Office of Energy Analysis within 
the Department of Commerce. 
There he applied himself to the de- 
velopment of strategies for contain- 
ing atomic power plant wastes. 

His permanent identity began to 
breathe more and more easily as the 
years passed. On a level of which 

9 



Clark himself was unaware except 
as a sometimes pensive mood, he 
began to feel that perhaps he had, 
by good luck and a strictly virtuous 
life, escaped the consequences of 
that other existence. 

Then, within three humid, sultry 
summer weeks, the mysterious 
magnetism of fate caught him up 
again in the net he had so striven to 
escape. 

From Hermsberg Mahler had also 
ascended into paradise upon his 
death and had raged in impotent 
fury at his own survival, which 
went counter to his philosophical 
convictions and promised yet other 
miseries in some new life. Hatred 
impelled him to seek vengeance 
against kleiner Helmut now that 
vengeance seemed a possibility. The 
spark of his existence followed an 
energy storm to the Americas. 

His daughter Eva could never 
forger that brief assault in the recep- 
tion hall. Despite his crudity and 
violence, she had sensed a genuine 
affection deep within the blond 
SS-guard. He had pointed to experi- 
ences Eva longed to have but 
couldn’t achieve in the brief and 
constrained life that had been left 
her at that point — rapidly ended af- 
ter transfer to another camp. She 
also went to America, now that he 
was there. 

The three of them coincided in 
Washington, D.C., in 1974,

Clark returned to the Depart- 
ment after his customary noon-time 
walk around the Elipse. On the way 
he passed the White House and 


made a jog through Lafayette Park 
to extend his walk. 

It was one of those Washington 
days — so humid even the eyeballs 
sweated. Men walked the streets 
pathetically carrying coats over 
shoulders, ties loose and pulled 
down, collars open, mopping brows 
with soggy handkerchiefs. Tourists 
stood in long, sweating lines wait- 
ing to get into the White House. 
Cameras hung from their necks and 
tugging children from their hands. 
Angry voices shattered the vacation 
mood. 

Clark was made of stemer stuff. 
He wore his coat about powerful 
shoulders. His tie was trimly 
bunched at his neck. He could 
tough it through southern humidity 
on pure spirit alone. 

A bank sign on Pennsylvania Av- 
enue said that it was 96 degrees. 
The humidity was hitting eighty. Up 
ahead the sun blazed down and 
sparkled in the fountains of 
Lafayette Park where a few brave 
lunchers sat on shaded patches of 
grass while pigeons pranced head- 
bobbing on the walks. 

Neither heat nor cold bothered 
Clark. He went on his walk no mat- 
ter what. He was as steady as the 
men of the postal service. Neither 
hail nor shine nor fear of night — or 
whatever it said on the face of the 
postal building. He always walked 
around the Elipse twice, watching 
the softball players when they were 
out, nodding to red-faced, agonized, 
sweating middle-aged joggers, oggled 
the White House from a distance, 
and eventually returned to the De- 
partment. 

He entered the building from the 
14th Street side and glimpsed

bearded Jack Hansley up ahead re- 
turning from lunch with a tall man 
who gesticulated with long fingers 
in an animated manner as he 
walked. Clark guessed the tall man 
was yet another of Jack Hansley’s 
school mates, probably another con- 
sultant. 

When he reached the elevator, 
those two were already gone, prob- 
ably taking the stairs to save 
energy — Hansley was a bit crazy 
about symbolic gestures. 

In his own wing, Clark made a 
slight detour to pass by Evelyn’s of- 
fice, his throat tightening. He stop- 
ped in the door. “Hi,” he said, and 
waved to her. She waved back from 
an inclined position, elbows on the 
spread-out Washington Post, She 
was reading the latest transcripts of 
the latest tapes. After the wave she 
looked down again, and Clark reluc- 


tantly went to his own office. He 
munched diet cookies pensively, 
thinking about her. 

Evelyn was the only woman in 
his office — discounting the clerical 
people — and had been hired recently 
in fulfillment of the Affirmative Ac- 
tion Plan to get the office up to 
quota on women and minorities. 

Unlike Clark she came from the 
east — Massachussetts. Everything 
about her spoke of wealth — the 
slender figure, high cheekbones, the 
fine white fuzz on her cheeks (you 
could see it from the right angle in 
the right light), the softness of her 
figure, the darkness of her languid 
eyes, the length of her lashes, the 
gleam of her pampered hair. 

The first time he had come upon 
her in the office, Clark had almost 
sucked in his breath — despite the ‘I 
Voted for McGovern’ button she

wore on the knit blouse just above a 
large, bouncy, braless breast. 

He’d nodded to her curtly, had 
rapidly passed her by. In his office, 
turned toward the window so that 
no one would see him do it, he 
squirted ‘Mouthfresh’ between his 
jaws from a thumb-sized aerosol. 
Then, resolutely, his grey eyes 
steady in his wide face, one hand 
self-consciously brushing his crew- 
cut blond hair, he went right back 
where he’d left her studying a civil 
rights poster on the bulletin board. 
He stuck out his hand iri the forth- 
right manner of a good midwestern 
boy. 

“Hi,” he said. “My name’s John 
Clark. What’s yours?” 

He had never done anything like 
that with a woman, neither with a 
stranger nor a prospective col- 
league. But Evelyn Bantry aroused 
a powerful emotion in him, not un- 
like a memory of long-suppressed 
desire. He knew her before he knew 
her, as it were. 

We’re meant for each other, he’d 
thought at the time, and he had 
swallowed at the suddenness, the 
spontaneous explosion of that 
thought. 

It wasn’t possible, not really. She 
was very, very different from him, 
quite unlike Betty who worked in 
Chicago as a nurse and whom Clark 
more or less meant to marry one of 
these days. 

Evelyn was radical. That soon 
emerged, and was reinforced, in 
countless discussions they had with 
each other. These talks seldom end- 
ed on a note of harmony, and yet 
both of them felt compelled to start 
them and to prolong them, some- 
times even over dinner. 

12 


Mostly they talked about work. 
She had a very different conception 
of it than he did. 

They were in the Energy Game, 
by Clark’s reckoning — providing 
energy to the American people, 
American industry. He was in there 
swinging for the Standard of Liv- 
ing. People like Clark and the work 
they did ensured a prosperous fu- 
ture. 

In Evelyn’s eyes this particular 
section of the Office of Energy 
Analysis had been created by liber- 
als to balance and check the Atomic 
Energy Commission’s reckless drive 
for unlimited nuclear power. The 
section was charged with analysis of 
nuclear waste containment 
strategies, and if it was in the De- 
partment of Commerce by legal 
mandate rather than in the AEC, 
any fool could guess that Congress 
didn’t trust the AEC to do the job 
right. 

Yeah, but . Clark’s reasoning 
went somewhat differently. If the 
atomic power industry couldn’t find 
acceptable ways to manage its 
wastes, it couldn’t expand rapidly 
enough to provide the American 
people with the power they de- 
manded, and so, indirectly — 

“Screw the American people,” 
Evelyn had cried on one occasion in 
her liberated way. Clark would still 
see her as she’d sat, legs up on the 
corner of her desk, the window be- 
hind her flowing hair — red this time. 
Her naked toes had wiggled angrily 
in sandals. Clark had stared into the 
shadows of her loose, bell- 
bottomed, checkered slacks. In his 
mind he followed her disappearing 
leg . 

Hold that thought — it ain’t de- 
GALAXY 



cent, Evelyn’s a nice girl despite 
her liberation. If she thinks that 
we’re in business to hold up energy 
consumption, she’s wrong, of 
course, and ought to go to work for 
the environmental boys. But it’s her 
business, and I hope she stays. 

She was a nice girl — dammit! 

Clark reached up and slapped 
himself playfully. He had to get her 
out of his head and get to work. He 
brushed diet cookie crumbs from 
the June progress report on the New 
Mexico siting study. Steadily drop- 
ping water tables in that relatively 
empty state, excellent geology, and 
a half-way interested Indian tribe all 
came together as a potential long- 
term nuclear waste storage site with 
more than a hundred years of capac- 
ity. He opened the report and began 
to read.

Two floors higher up, bearded 
Jack Hansley, head of the Office of 
Energy Analysis, emerged from his 
carpeted suite with an arm around 
Ted Aspic’s shoulder — an equally 
young but much taller man. 

“It’s a far-out idea, Ted,” he 
said. “Way out. But then you’ve 
always had far-out notions — and 
I’ve always been a sucker for 
them.” 

He released Aspic’s shoulder and 
stood for a moment pondering, fin- 
gers a-twirl in his beard. 

“Tell you what,” he resumed 
with a glance. “I’ll take you down 
to see one of my people — John 
Clark. He’s a bit . conservative, 
shall we say? But a solid man. I’ve 
got him doing this kind of stuff — 

PLUTONIUM 


contingency planning. That’s about 
all that the AEC will let us do. See 
if you can talk him into it. I’ll put 
in a good word for you, of course, 
but you understand my problem. On 
an idea like this, I’ve got to have 
the staff behind me. By the way, 
Ted, how come you’re into sociol- 
ogy now? Aren’t you in physics any 
more?” 

“ Future Now is into whatever we 
can get funded,” Aspic said. “Just 
so long as I like the concept.” He 
stepped over to the secretary’s desk 
and picked up a fat brown bag de- 
signed to fit beneath an airplane 
seat. 

“Is that what you call it? Future 
Nowl How do you like consulting, 
by the way?” 

Aspic’s long face drew into a 
smile. “Freedom, man. It’s the 
freedom trip. Hungry, hustling, but 
free. No, seriously, we’re doing 
fine. I’ve got four engineers on 
board, a couple of economists, a 
planner, and . hold on now — an 
astrologer!” 

“An astrologer. ?” 

“It’s the latest. I’m gambling a 
bit here, but nowadays . Jack, 
the occult is in\ Give me another 
month or two, and I’ll have sold my 
astrologer full time to the Office of 
Education. I mean it!” 

They walked toward the door. 
Hansley smiled, shaking his head. 
“Ted,” he said, holding the door, 
“one of these days you’ll hit it big. 
I just know it.” 

They walked out. The secretary, 
who had been listening with mild 
interest, picked up her nail polish 
bottle and slowly, carefully, 
creamed another layer of turquoise 
on her left thumb.

★ ★ ★ 

Clark seethed inwardly when 
Hansley left giving an unmistake- 
able signal —fund this guy! 

He looked down at the card. Fu- 
ture Now, Theodore J. Aspic III., 
President. Mountainview, Califor- 
nia. A West Coast huckster, to be 
sure. “To be sure," it echoed in his 
head, and he saw the puckered lips 
of a woman on a commercial selling 
deodorant. 

He glanced up at this guy with 
eyes narrowed in hostility. Some- 
thing about the man. ... He Was 
inordinately tall and sat slouched in 
the chair, his back forming one side 
of a triangle between the chairback 
and the seat. His long legs were 
crossed. He had placed his hands 
behind his head, long fingers in- 
tertwined. Early grey showed at his 
temples. Large, dark, watery eyes 
looked across the desk with a mea- 
sure of hidden merriment, condes- 
cension. ? Clark didn’t like Ted 
Aspic one bit. The man had kook 
written all over him, but he was 
dangerous kook, well-connected 
kook. 

“Well, sir, what can I do for 
you, Mr. Aspic?” 

“Let’s make that Ted, shall 
we?” The dark eyes looked at him 
with moist penetration for a mo- 
ment. Then Aspic uncoiled his arms 
and legs and bent down toward his 
bag. He fumbled around for a mo- 
ment and came up with a sheaf of 
Xeroxed sheets. He held the pages 
in his hand, not looking at them, 
leaned forward over them. 

“Isn’t it true that Plutonium-239 
has a half-life of 24,000 years?” 

14 


Does water flow down hill? Clark 
thought. He barely nodded. 

“And isn’t it also true, John, that 
plutonium wastes have to be con- 
tained some 250,000 years? As a 
consequence of that half-life, I 
mean?” 

“So I have been told,” Clark 
said, hoping the sarcasm would 
glimmer through. 

They were all like this, the well- 
connected kooks. They discovered 
atomic wastes one day reading the 
San Francisco Chronicle or the LA 
Times, and then they sailed in here 
with half-baked notions that a man 
was supposed to swallow with joy 
and hallelujas. Had Aspic discov- 
ered abandoned salt mines? Would 
he suggest deep- well injection? Or 
was it empty missile silos this time? 
Hansley had dubbed him a physi- 
cist, so he probably wanted to shoot 
the crap up into space at an as- 
tronomical cost. On the other hand, 
this guy looked like a left-wing 
raddy of the first water. He proba- 
bly wanted to use the waste to heat 
black people’s pools in winter time 
or some such nonsense. 

I better cool it, Clark told him- 
self. Whatever else this character is, 
he’s the public, and service is the 
name of the game. 

Aspic had been leafing through 
the pages in his hand. Now he 
found his place and looked up. 

“This is an article I came across 
recently and it gave me an idea. 
The Smithsonian Magazine. Article 
by Dennis Farney.” 

Clark nodded. He knew the arti- 
cle. It was entitled: “Ominous prob- 
lem: what to do with radioactive 
waste.” Half the congressional mail 
lately had dealt with it. 


GALAXY 



“The part that gave me the idea 
is this paragraph here on page 
twenty-four. He’s talking about the 
problem of long-term containment 
and so on and so forth, and then he 
says here, ‘Some have seriously 
proposed that society create a new 
kind of “priesthood” to watch over 
the waste, much as medieval monks 
watched over mankind’s written his- 
tory in the Dark Ages. Presumably, 
this priesthood would have to be 
supranational in character and 
somehow insulated from the rise 
and fall of nations through the cen- 
turies.’ ” 

Aspic looked up. Clark regarded 
him with a steady gaze, but in- 
wardly he groaned. It was much 
worse than he had thought. Even 
Congress had passed up that para- 
graph. 

What do you propose to do?” 

“I propose to look into the feasi- 
bility of setting up such a priest- 
hood. My initial notion was sort of 
along the lines of the Jesuits, you 
see, but after we did a bit of work 
on the back of the envelope, it 
seemed better to create a 
hereditary — ” 

“How much?” Clark asked in a 
tight little voice. 

The dark, watery eyes looked up. 
“A hundred and fifty kay.” 

Clark didn’t blink; he stared 
back. 

“For phase one,” Aspic added. 

* * * 

From the 747’s nearly stratos- 
pheric altitude, the Rocky Moun- 
tains, now flattening slowly toward 
the west, looked like the uneven 
scales of a giant brown lizzard. 
Empty land. 

PLUTONIUM 


Aspic contemplated the scene be- 
low, awash in closely linked 
thoughts. His long, thin fingers 
rested lightly on the second gin-over 
rocks he’d substituted for his usual 
martinis. The flight was empty and 
he had three seats all to himself. 
He’d kicked off his shoes and 
loosened his tie. He enjoyed now 
the last hour of that light serenity 
such trips always gave him. 
Soon the plane would dip down 
over the bay and come in for a 
landing in San Francisco. Bronzed, 
efficient Helen would await him 
with the kids and tell him all about 
the tennis games she had or hadn’t 
won. The children would whine and 
want a souvenir from the airport 
shops. They’d screech and wail in 
the station wagon all the way home, 
but Helen wouldn’t hear them; she 
had nerves of steel; and he wouldn’t 
bother to shut them up. Permissive 
child-rearing ... no pay-out, no 
pay-out at all. 

He took a sip on the gin and 
stared down again at the brown 
emptiness imagining a great monas- 
tic cluster down there, a foundation 
worthy of ancient Cluny — but de- 
voted to the maintenance of boiling, 
eternal, atomic wastes. Would the 
monks chant? Would they evolve a 
totally new religion over time? Or 
would one have to invent the reli- 
gion in advance? A good question 
that needed exploration, a specific 
research task to be written into the 
proposal John Clark had at last, re- 
luctantly, asked be prepared. 

Aspic thought about Clark for a 
second, recalling the man. An up- 
tight type, evident even from the 
short hair he wore ... in this day 
and age. He’d sat behind his desk 

15 



upright and stiff. On the way out 
Aspic had noted that the man wore 
white socks. Had clearly been proud 
of that hammerlock-style manly 
handshake. A typical provincial kid 
come to Washington to help run the 
great federal machine. Aspic knew 
how to deal with them. They were 
easily flattered into submission by a 
show of interest. But Clark. 

Clark had aroused in Aspic a 
kind of hostility which was far more 
than merely a mirroring of the dis- 
like Clark had exuded toward him ! 

Could I have met him somewhere 
before? Aspic wondered. Surely 
not. I’ve never been in Oshkosh or 
Kokomo or Wichita Falls or wher- 
ever the hell he comes from. Maybe 
in a previous life. ? 

Aspic smiled to himself, but then 
the smile faded and he took a 
good-sized suck on his drink, pen- 
sively crunched a bit of ice. 

A year ago he’d had a stormy 
love affair with a lady professor 
from UCLA during a joint project 
for the now defunct National Mate- 
rials Policy Commission. She had 
been the perfect antidote to 
Helen — wilting, far-out sensuality. 
Cheeks a little saggy. Eyes a little 
rayed. Long, mournful breasts. 
Baggy rears. She’d worn copper 
bracelets on both wrists and had 
been into everything imaginable. 

She had introduced him to LSD 
at the peak of their romance when 
he’d spent three, four days in Los 
Angeles each week. She believed in 
reincarnation and swore to him he 
could retrace his lives under the 
sway of acid. He had laughed that 
off; she had insisted, quoting Tim 
Leary, and at last he’d dropped a 
little acid on a dare. 


Now Aspic pondered that experi- 
ence. 

Inconclusive, by and large. 
Yet. Amidst all the tortured, 
ecstatic, twisted, oozing, mind- 
blowing experiences, he recalled 
one sequence that had sent him 
screaming from wall to wall in the 
bare room they’d used for those 
sessions. It had been a vision of a 
concentration camp. Aspic had been 
a jew, a prominent lawyer reduced 
to clearing, tree-stumps from frozen 
German earth. 

He shuddered at the recall. After 
that experience he had quietly with- 
drawn from the professor, had as- 
signed one of the economists to 
work with her. He’d never touched 
acid since, would never touch it 
again. 

The stewardess stopped by his 
seat. “Everything all right?” 

He nodded and smiled to her and 
she moved on. 

He lifted and swirled the gin- 
over-rocks, tempted against all 
reason to dwell further and deeper 
on that acid vision, sensing that it 
contained something important, 
something that might explain his 
powerful aversion to John Clark of 
Commerce. 

Aspic took a drink and forced his 
mind away from the subject. He 
would discuss the matter with 
Templar over lunch tomorrow. To 
Jack Hansley he’d represented 
Templar as an astrologer, but Cam 
was much more than that. He was a 
genuine mystic, little more than a 
nearsighted kid, but gifted! The kid 
was weirdl Making his living cast- 
ing horoscopes — until Aspic had 
lifted him up into the middle class 
by a single wave of his long fin-

gers. Cam might have an explana- 
tion. If reincarnation really worked, 
in a manner of speaking (not that it 
was comparable to a machine, but 
still) then something might be done 
with that knowledge, the matter 
could be explored further with a 
grant from the National Science 
Foundation. NSF was an easy mark 
for such odd things. The results 
might even be applied in that pro- 
ject with Clark. Heredity. 

The pitch of the engines changed 
ever so slightly. The long descent 
had begun. 

Ill 

A year passed before the contract 
was let. Even under ordinary cir- 
cumstances, the federal mills 
ground very, very slowly. But in 
this case other factors were in- 
volved. For one thing, Future Now 
received a non-competed procure- 
ment which required long justifica- 
tions. For another, Clark went into 
the job with a great deal less than 
his usual enthusiasm. Only periodic 
prods from the front office made 
him move the papers toward the in- 
evitable dump of a hundred and 
fifty thousand dollars in Aspic’s di- 
rection. And, most importantly, dur- 
ing this time Clark was preoccupied 
with Evelyn Bantry. 

He was especially preoccupied 
with her on this Friday morning; so 
much so that he could barely keep 
his mind on the substance of the 
meeting. 

Clark represented Commerce on 
an inter-agency working group. The 
first meeting of the group was in 
progress in a windowless AEC con- 
ference room — a large table ringed 

18 


by a grey wall of bureaucratic 
faces. A man from the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs held forth acrimoni- 
ously against the New Mexico Plan, 
hitting the table with a fist and 
pointing index. His point, which he 
made in as many ways as he could 
think of and as often as he could 
grab the word, was that the decision 
of the Shashtuk Tribal Council was 
in no way binding on the 
Department — by which he meant his 
department, Interior. AEC and 
Commerce should be lauded for 
finding a long-term storage site, but 
they could place it somewhere other 
than on BIA land, thank you. 

Ordinarily Clark would have been 
roused to battle-ardor by such 
bureaucratic attack. Today he 
couldn’t focus, nor did he have to. 
Interior would lose this battle. 
Energy came first. And tonight he’d 
score, by God! Finally, at long, 
long last, he’d score ! 

His mind wandered into the fu- 
ture with anticipation. Too many 
hours still separated him from the 
inevitable. At eleven he had a meet- 
ing with Aspic — progress report 
time. Then a quick walk around the 
Elipse. Clark doubted that he’d get 
much work done in the afternoon, 
excited as he was, so he’d do some 
reading, maybe, and cut out early, 
and buy the wine she’d asked him 
to bring, and a bunch of flowers, 
get showered and shaved, and then 
at six sharp he’d be in front of her 
apartment door on New Hampshire 
Avenue for home-cooked dinner 
and . you know what! 

Man . 

Clark glanced at his watch. Quar- 
ter to eleven. He had to get out of 
here. Rising, he excused himself, 


GALAXY 



pleading another appointment. He 
gathered papers into his briefcase 
and left. 

In a year his appearance had 
changed. Now his blond hair hung 
down long and rich — George 
Washington, Tom Jefferson style. 
He sported a good-sized mustache 
with down-curling ends. He wore a 
natty checkered suit and dark socks 
under buckled shoes. His briefcase 
was imitation crocodile. 

On the way out he stopped 
briefly before a large bulletin board 
and searched the sheaves of position 
descriptions for a GS-14. Not that 
he needed the money. But if he 
married Evelyn, he should be a 
grade higher in case she wanted to 
quit working and have babies. He 
saw two or three 14’s advertised, 
but they were all in far-off places. 
Nobody would grab those, of 
course. He passed on. 

He met Aspic on the way in, in 
the dark entry hall of Commerce, 
and they went up to the office to- 
gether. At the moment Clark could 
even take Aspic without irritation. 
He almost bantered with the tall 
man on the way. They settled 
down — Clark behind his desk, As- 
pic in front of it. 

“You want the door closed?” 
Aspic asked with a sly grin. 

Aspic knew how much this pro- 
ject embarrassed Clark. The men in 
the office had begun to call him the 
‘plutonium priest,’ and ‘Father,’ 
and ‘Brother Clark.’ But now 
Clark’s humor was excellent. 

“Naw,” he said, waving a hand, 
“leave it open.” 

They got down to business. 

Aspic’s original idea had grown 
with time into a veritable forest of 

PLUTONIUM 


concepts. He spread before Clark a 
long flow-diagram depicting the 
study phases, a maze of rectangles 
connected by lines. His long index 
finger pointed to boxes as he 
explained the sequence of tasks. 
The psycho-profile questionnaires to 
determine the optimal personality 
mix of various gradations of a Per- 
manent Priesthood were in testing 
now, with good results. Ceremonial 
and Rituali sties were not yet scoped 
out fully, but Cam Templar — whom 
Clark had met on the last trip, if he 
could recall — had started work. 

“But what worries me,” Aspic 
said, leaning over the desk, tapping 
a large box in which, tentatively, 
someone had drawn a question mark 
in pencil, lightly, “is Succession 
Insurance.” 

His long form straightened and he 
sat down in his chair. 

“My thinking is this way, John. 
For a century or two we might rely 
on natural recruitment. Or we could 
make the priesthood hereditary, 
with everyone living right in the 
monastic compound, and cross- 
breeding between monasteries — 
that’s Option B, as you’ll recall. 
But I just can’t give you any cer- 
tainty beyond about four genera- 
tions. So much could change in that 
time. The social fabric might break 
down — it almost did under Nixon. 
It could happen again — and, who 
knows, next time we might not 
make it. No matter how appealing 
or frightening or whatever we make 
the religion inside, sooner or later 
people might start to drift from the 
priesthood, enticed away by the 
outside. Look at the Catholics, a 
perfect analogy. We’ve got to come 
up with . something. Something 

19 



really hard to bind these people to 
the Custodial Service. Now I’ve got 
some ideas along those lines, and 
NSF has given us a little grant to 
help explore it, but in the long run 
it might take big money.” 

Aspic looked at Clark wondering 
if he had said too much already. If 
the Permanent Priesthood concept 
made Clark shy, what Aspic now 
had in mind would make him bolt! 
But he had to lay some foundations 
now — it was either that or talk Jack 
Hansley into appointing another pro- 
ject officer. 

Clark’s eyes had narrowed and he 
had straightened up behind his desk. 
“What are you talking about?” 

“Ohhh,” Aspic said. He looked 
down at his hands. He chose his 
words with care. More than ever he 
was certain that this man across the 
desk had played a crucial role in 
his, in Aspic’s life. Discounting for 
genetic differences, which inevitably 
prevented identical appearance, 
Clark nevertheless incarnated that 
certain personality Aspic knew from 
an LSD vision. He had returned to 
that vision under Cam Templar’s 
careful tutelage. He saw the Ger- 
man SS-guard in Clark, the cruel 
blond beast with ready boots and 
rifle stock. It was in his eyes, the 
manner, even in the fall of the 
man’s long hair — (whatever had in- 
duced him to let it grow long?) — as 
if the man’s soul-force radiated out 
through the physical matrix forcing 
it to give a semblance of identity 
even in the external. Such a man 
was dangerous, had to be watched, 
would have to be caught, would 
taste retribution. 

Aspic unfolded his hands, looked 
up. “Ohh,” he said again, “it’snoth- 

20 


ing much really, just an extension 
of the principle of heredity into 
another dimension, as it were. I’m 
not really ready to discuss it in 
detail—” 

“Say, Johnny, about that wine I 
asked you to bri — ” 

She stood in the doorway at the 
conclusion of a quick run down the 
hall, just a touch breathless, red 
hair flowing, braless breasts heaving, 
golden rings around her arm. 

“Evelyn! Evelyn Bantry, for 
God’s sake!" 

“Teddy!” 

They embraced affectionately and 
then looked at each other at arm’s 
length. Clark watched with a fist- 
sized hole in his stomach. 

“Harvard Square? Sixty nine?” 
he asked. 

“Has it been that long?” she 
asked. “Teddy, what a pleasant 
surprise! Are you . .” she glanced 
at Clark. “I mean — is this business?” 

Aspic nodded. “But you. You 
wouldn’t be working here, by any 
chance?” 

“Sure,” she said, “This is my 
turf, Ted. And you? Are you on 
your own? Or still with — was it 
GE?” 

“Free as a bird,” he said. “On 
my own. I’ve formed this small 
consulting group on the West 
Coast — but say, Evelyn. This is no 
place. What about lunch? Can you 
make it?” 

“Why not,” she said impulsively 
with a darting glance at Clark. 
“Let’s catch up on things on my 
time — rather than Uncle’s.” She 
turned to Clark. “Sorry to barge in 
on a meeting like this, John. Your 
door was open, and so I. .” Her 
head went back to Aspic. “Just

pick me up at my office down the 
hall.” She gestured. ‘‘Bye, now.” 

“Evelyn!” Clark called, but she 
had already disappeared. 

* * ★ 

At five ten minute intervals Clark 
trudged out of his office and went 
down the hall past hers. Two 
o’clock, two-fifteen, two-twenty, 
quarter to three. 

He began to call her apartment. 
At first there was no answer. Then 
the phone was busy. Finally an 
operator told him it was out of or- 
der. 

At four o’clock he went home 
without a word to anyone. In the 
closet-sized kitchen of his efficiency 
apartment, he rummaged in the 
back of a cabinet until he came up 
with a pint of whiskey, three- 
quarters full. Slouched in the single 
armchair in the living room, he 
drank the booze out of the bottle 
slowly, staring at his watch from 
time to time. At five-thirty he 
straightened his tie, dabbed at his 
mustache, brushed his hair, and 
went down into the street. He 
bought a bottle of wine in a liquor 
store down the block. He hailed a 
cab and told it to take him to 20th 
and New Hampshire Avenue. 

He walked through the gold- 
carpeted lobby, passed beneath the 
chandelier, nodded to the guard in 
his red, epauletted uniform. His 
finger touched the elevator button 
and the device turned a faint pink. 
Silvery doors slid aside. He stepped 
in and found Floor Nine. The 
elevator surged up. 

Before her door he pressed the 
bell, later hammered on the imita- 

PLUTONIUM 


tion oak with his fist. At last she 
opened the door a crack, dishelved, 
in a robe. He pushed his way in, 
went past her through a short, nar- 
row hall. In the dining nook he 
glimpsed the table — probably set the 
night before — a rich table cloth, two 
plates, silver, crystal, unlit candles, 
a flowery centerpiece. 

Evelyn came behind him, talking, 
but he didn’t hear what she said. 
Blood pounded in his temples, be- 
hind his eyes, sang in his ears. He 
had never been inside her place, but 
he found the bedroom without trou- 
ble. Aspic lay on the bed, naked 
but for shorts, an apprehensive 
look on his face as he stared up at 
Clark framed in the door. The 
Princess-style push-button phone on 
the dresser was off the hook and 
made a rythmic, cricket noise. 

For a second Clark stared at As- 
pic and at the bed. The covers had 
been pushed off the greyish, 
much-used, wrinkled bed sheet. Her 
clothes lay in a heap to one side, 
hastily dropped. 

“Hey ...” Aspic called, seeing 
the look in Clark’s eyes, regretting 
now the laughs he and Ev had had 
about Clark between bouts of 
passion. He extended a hand toward 
Clark in a warding, cajoling gesture. 

Clark took the bottle by its neck 
and threw it at Aspic with all of his 
force. But he was unsteady and 
slow from drinking. Aspic saw the 
motion and rolled out of the way. 
The bottle hit the soft, padded 
back-board of the bed and fell un- 
harmed on the sheet, a dark-green, 
round-bellied Portugese rose. 

A sob formed in Clark’s throat. 
He didn’t have his heart in the act 
of violence. Evelyn! She had de- 

21 



stroyed him, but he could do noth- 
ing to her. He turned aside and 
brushed past her without a look. 

She had followed him to the bed- 
room door and stood with her arms 
raised protectively in front, tiny 
fists beneath her chin, eyes shrink- 
ing. Four martinis, it echoed in her 
mind while her eyes were on Clark. 
Four martinis, she told herself dul- 
ly, suddenly sobered and aghast at 
her own stupidity. She had been 
dazed and utterly silly and 
now . She felt sick to her 
stomach and turned away. 

Clark stopped in the dinette, sup- 
pressing sobs. He took hold of the 
fine, patterned damask. A jerk sent 
plates, silver, crystal, candles, and 
flower-piece crashing to the terazzo 
floor. He walked out of the apart- 
ment toward the elevator. 

Back in his own apartment, Clark 
went to the only piece of furniture 
he owned in this furnished 
efficiency — an old-fashioned roll- 
top desk. He began to rummage in 
its narrow cubicles. Cancelled 
checks, plastic name tags he’d worn 
at conferences, an insurance policy, 
letters from Mom, a yellow-red ga- 
rage bill, a little black book! He 
took it with him to the bedroom, sat 
down on the bed, and lifted the 
telephone onto his lap. He dialed a 
string of numbers. 

Far away, in the Windy City, on 
the shores of Lake Michigan, a 
telephone rang, and rang, and rang. 
Then at last, just as he was about to 
hang up in despair, a cheery voice 
came on. 

“Hello?” 

“Betty!” he husked into the 
mouthpiece. “Oh, Betty, I love 
you, I love you.”

IV 

In the fall of 2006 , they finished 
building the odd-shaped radar dishes 
on top of the hexagonal building 
some distance from the compound, 
and three days later planes started to 
land scientific teams at the govern- 
ment airport a couple of kilometers 
beyond Perpetual, New Mexico. 

Radar dishes? 

John Clark had no other name for 
them. Oh, sure. They probably had 
fancy-dancy names and did some- 
thing unusual, else there wouldn’t be 
the tight security surrounding the 
project. But to him they looked like 
radar dishes. 

He gunned the jeep and roared 
past the new complex oggling those 
shallow baskets of wire, reddened 
now in the setting sun. He sus- 
pected that this was a defense instal- 
lation after all and had nothing to 
do with rad-waste storage. Probably 
some of that super-hush psycho 
stuff rumored to be under develop- 
ment now that the U.S. was about 
to plunge into the Russo-Chinese 
war despite Hubbard’s election-year 
promises. The Chinese, supposedly, 
had missiles implanted with living 
human brains so cleverly trained 
they could evade virtually any kind 
of mechanical counter-rocket. 
Psycho was the only answer. From 
what Clark had picked up, it pro- 
jected fields of the greatest sensitiv- 
ity and caused schizoid reactions in 
the missile-brains leading to their 
self-chosen destruction high up in 
the atmosphere. 

God, he hoped Hubbard would 
stay the hell out of that war. He 
personally didn’t care. He was too 


GALAXY 



old for that sort of thing by a long 
shot. But the boys. 

No. He for one didn’t see any 
reason for a Russo-Chinese inter- 
vention, yet tonight on the news 
three cabinet officials, in speeches 
across the country, had floated up 
the first trial baloon. In other 
words, the decision had already 
been made. 

Desert streaked by on either side 
of him, lovely in the gathering 
dark. It had rained briefly two days 
ago — the first time this year — and 
the desert had bloomed like a wom- 
an in love. Clark was of two 
minds about rain. On the one hand 
it made this country beautiful 
beyond compare. On the other it 
caused trouble. The torrent had re- 
vealed several leaks into arti- 
cavems G and K, and Emergency 
had been mobilized for two days 
and a night to plug the leaks, lest 
steam formation generate pressures 
great enough to cause a series of 
cave-ins. God, what a mess that’d 
be! 

Up ahead Clark saw the dirt road 
and applied pressure to the brake. 
He turned the jeep off to the right 
and bounced forward leaving a trail 
of dust. Chief Walk-on-air would 
see that cloud and know that old 
man Clark was coming — although 
the chief didn’t need outward signs 
to know the future, he knew it, al- 
though you couldn’t get him to say 
much more than a handful of words 
at a time. Walk-on-air had told him 
about those leaks, but without the 
rain they hadn’t been able to find 
them. 

Clark felt revulsion. He hated 
rad-waste with a depth and passion 
so basic it was a kind of Super- 

PLUTONIUM 


loathing. Years and years and years 
ago he had gladly grabbed a GS-14 
to get the hell out of Washington, 
to marry Betty, and to live among 
decent folk far from the pointy- 
heads and whores of the Potomac. 
It had been a good life at first. 
Betty had turned out to be his kind 
of girl — calm, handy, and true as 
true-blue could be. Later on, when 
the New Mexico Plan came to 
fruition — his plan — he had volun- 
teered to help set up the site among 
the Shashtuk indians. In those days 
there had been nothing out here but 
cactus and earth huts. They’d lived 
in a trailer for two years. Things 
sure had changed since then. Look 
at Perpetual: ten thousand people. A 
rail-line brought the rad-waste from 
thousands of miles away — 
kilometers , Clark; don’t always 
forget about metrication. Four great 
compounds. Ninety-six arti-cavems. 
And yet it was all like ashes in the 
mouth. 

Clark couldn’t recall precisely 
when it had hit him. Before the 
Act, of course. Perhaps in the late 
eighties, eighty-four, eighty- 
six .. thereabouts in time. He’d 
already felt it sharply in eighty- 
seven, the year they broke infla- 
tion’s back and the civil service 
took a sixty-percent paycut. Freddy 
was nine years old, Gerry seven. 
That same year they passed the 
Nuclear Waste Security Act, and 
people like Clark were frozen in 
their jobs, willy-nilly. They had no 
power, the handful of guys out in 
the field running these hazardous 
waste depots. The Union had bar- 
gained away their future for a 
whopping pension plan. A few 
people had muttered about 20th cen- 

23 



tury serfs in the media, but the 
Kansas salt mine disaster had 
blinded everyone. Besides, Clark 
could have left the service had he 
wanted to — a free man still. But 
who would do that with depression 
raging out there and two young 
boys to feed. So he had stayed, but 
that feeling had grown by degrees. 

He still remembered sitting at the 
kitchen table, nights, his fist around 
a can of beer, morose, staring at the 
placemat left over from dinner, the 
TV going in another room, thinking 
about Aspic, wondering if Aspic 
had been behind the Nuclear Waste 
Security Act, the first shot in a war 
planned long ago. But it didn’t 
seem likely. He’d lost sight of all 
those people. Aspic had been a 
kook. Somebody had probably 
found him out. 

Betty came up behind him and 
put her hands on his shoulder by his 
neck. He could feel her lips touch 
the top of his head. The short bris- 
tles tickled. 

“Don’t brood, honey.” 

But he had brooded on and on 
until it was too late. 

Up ahead loomed a Shashtuk 
roundhouse. Smoke curled from its 
center. A ’95 Chevy sedan stood 
parked off to the side. It had been 
doctored Indian style with roof cut 
off by hack-saw. Dogs came yelp- 
ing and then, recognizing his scent, 
turned into tail-wobbling welcome. 

He alighted with a groan, heaving 
his big belly. Got to diet. Just Gotto! 
He went into the hut, bending to 
clear the low door. Dung-smoke 
and Shashtuk odors mingled in his 
nostrils. An ancient crone squatted 
by the fire with a pan. A young boy 
sat on a cot. 


“Hiya, Superintendent.” 

Clark nodded to the boy. 
“Where’s the chief?” 

The boy gestured into darkness. 

“Up on the rise?” Clark asked. 

The boy nodded. 

Clark went out again and trekked 
slowly up the slight elevation be- 
hind the house, marked by two 
large cacti resembling hands 
stretched to the sky. The dogs fol- 
lowed him a short distance, then 
dropped back. 

He found’ Chief Walk-on-air seat- 
ed between the giant plants, hands 
on his knees, his face turned to the 
west where the sun had finally set 
and only a thin line of crimson 
separated darkness from darkness. 
The old man had a wrinkled indian 
face and jet-black hair bound into a 
braid in the back. His eyes were 
closed. 

Clark caught his breath a bit and 
then sat down on the bare ground. 
Doing so he noticed a bundle next 
to the chief. Had Walk-on-air been 
out collecting peyote? Or was he 
bound outward now? In the dark- 
ness Clark couldn’t see whether the 
bag was full or not. It was just a 
blackness on the ground. 

Clark waited knowing that no 
amount of coaxing would make the 
old chief speak until he chose to do 
so on his own accord. Clark wasn’t 
any younger than the indian; 
perhaps he was even older. But in 
all other respects the chief was the 
teacher, Clark the disciple. 

It had all begun fifteen years ago 
when Clark had heard about the old 
man’s prophetic powers and had 
sought him out with a question: 
“Will I ever leave Perpetual and get 
a start in another kind of business?” 


24 


GALAXY 



Clark still didn’t have an answer 
to that question. But from the first 
moment of their meeting, he had 
been attracted to the chief, almost 
indifferently at first, had acquiesced 
in a kind of strange relationship. It 
consisted of weekly meetings filled 
with long silences broken occasion- 
ally by a deep rumble of words. In 
the third year Walk-on-air an- 
nounced abruptly that he had 
“hunted” Clark’s spirit, had caught 
it, and found it good. In those days 
Clark had not yet learned his lesson 
and had pressed the chief to explain 
himself — but to no avail. But some 
weeks later the indian had fed him 
some peyote cut into small slices, 
and chewing them Clark had been 
catapulted into paradise. Then, 
twice a year thereafter, less fre- 
quently some years, the chief had 
repeated that procedure. 

His visionary experiences didn’t 
change Clark outwardly. He con- 
tinued on, the same as he was, but 
he no longer asked his questions, 
having been satisfied on that ac- 
count in some mysterious way. He 
knew that he would live and die 
here in Perpetual, that it was meet 
and fitting, that somehow it was 
meant to be, had something to do 
with his old longing to serve the 
public. 

Clark had resigned himself to 
that. But he hated it. God, he hated 
it. The chief was his only real 
consolation — the chief and the an- 
nual communion with the Holy 
Mushroom, an experience he kept 
from Betty with as much jealous 
secrecy as his humiliation by one 
Evelyn Bantry, whose memory still 
sometimes returned to him, whose 
figure appeared in his peyote 

plutonium 


visions, many-faced but always the 
same. 

Across the bit of rock-strewn dirt, 
Chief Walk-on-air opened his eyes. 

“Good-bye, old friend,” the in- 
dian rumbled in a gutteral, hard 
tone. x 

Good-bye? Clark sat still, didn’t 
answer. He’d let the chief say what 
he had to say. Questions only 
dammed up the thin trickle of 
communications that came out of 
the old man. 

Old man. I’m an old man 
too! 

“The Big Sky will come and 
fetch away Walk-on-air.” 

Silence. The crimson line on the 
horizon had thinned out and had 
disappeared. Now the cacti were 
like shadows. The first stars had 
appeared and blinked in rising heat. 

“This is a bad place for dying. 
Walk-on-air going south. Far 
away.” 

Why? Why is this a bad place for 
dying? 

They sat in silence for a long, 
long time. Then the chief stirred 
again. 

“White man has a spirit-catcher. 
Very evil machine. Walk-on-air go 
south, die, come back to Shashtuk 
land.” 

“What do you mean, spirit- 
catcher,” Clark blurted out. He 
slapped a hand to his mouth, but it 
was too late. He had disrupted the 
flow. 

For a long, long time he waited, 
but nothing more would come from 
the indian. The sky slowly thick- 
ened with stars, the Milky Way 
dusted across his vision when he 
lifted his head. At last Clark rose. 

“Good-bye, old Chief,” he said, 

25 



and he walked back down toward 
the jeep. 

On the way home he had a bad 
moment. Suddenly he felt in the pit 
of his stomach a kind of burning 
pressure he hadn’t felt in years 
now, an unpleasant echo of the late 
eighties when he’d gone through in- 
ner hell. He couldn’t well imagine 
that Walk-on-air would actually 
leave. He was as much a part of 
Clark’s life as — as Betty was, as the 
arti-cavems with their vats of eter- 
nally bubbling hi-rad sludges. The 
old man — old man, indeed! He was 
as strong as a bull. Not a thread of 
silver in his hair. He must have 
been joking. He was off peyote 
hunting deep in Mexico. He did that 
every year. The bag had looked 
very flat on the ground next to the 
indian. He’d be back in a couple of 
weeks, and then Clark would go out 
to see him again on Wednesday 
nights as usual. Nonsense about 
dying, spirit-catchers, stuff like 
that. 

He felt a little better. 

Soon he wheeled the jeep onto 
the surfaced road, gunned it and 
roared homeward. Betty and he 
lived inside the compound in the 
superintendent’s mansion that 
seemed so cavernously large now 
that the children were gone. When 
Gerry had visited earlier this sum- 
mer bringing his whole family with 
him — all five children whose names 
Clark hadn’t been able to keep 
straight — they had fitted in with lots 
of room to spare. After he and Betty 
had waved good-bye and the big red 
bus had pulled away, they’d walked 
back in and the place had echoed 
like a tomb. 

Near the compound Clark noticed 


that lights still burned in the new- 
fangled hexagonal security complex. 
He slowed down and peered inside 
through the tall barbed wire fence 
with its outreaching arms. As he 
watched he saw a man walk past a 
window, and he caught his breath 
involuntarily, thinking he’d seen 
Ted Aspic — or at any rate an old 
man with snow-white hair who 
might have been Aspic if Aspic still 
lived. Clark stomped on the brakes. 
Wheezing, he got out and leaned 
against the jeep, arms folded across 
his heavy beer-gut. He watched the 
window with a face as stiff as a 
board. The engine idled at his back. 
But nothing more happened. 

Clark shook his head. He was see- 
ing things. He got back into the 
jeep and drove on. Guards waved 
him through. He drove between 
gigantic silver storage tanks that 
held the low-rad waste and up to- 
ward the artificial hill where the 
super’s mansion stood with its 
lead-insulated walls. 

On the kitchen table Betty had 
left out a glass of milk and a couple 
of cookies. He looked at the snack 
but then changed his mind. He 
didn’t feel so good in the stomach. 

* * * ' 

Two weeks passed but the chief 
hadn’t returned. Three weeks. Five 
weeks. Toward the end, just before 
he was hospitalized in Perpetual, 
Clark had driven to the indian’s 
roundhouse every night, although 
the pain in his gut had forced him 
to drive doubled-up and Betty had 
begged him tearfully to relent, to 
give up, to be at peace, to find con- 
solation in the Twenty-third

Psalm — which she held out to him, 
marked with a red ribbon, . 

“The Lord is my shepherd, I 
shall not want ... he maketh me to 
lie down in green pastures . yea, 
though I walk through the valley of 
the shadow of death. ...” 

Finally the ambulance came. At- 
tendants took him from the jeep 
where he crouched in agonies 
against the wheel. Lights flashed 
and the sirens wailed. But they 
sounded far away, as if meant for 
another. 

He lingered on for two weeks 
more, now up, now down. 

In this time he had lucid mo- 
ments when an easing of his pain 
and the diminishing action of the 
drugs they fed him coincided. Food 
came to him through a tube in his 
arm. He had lost most of his 
stomach to cancer; the doctors 
couldn’t understand why he hadn’t 
complained before. 

In his states of temporary bliss, 
he listened to the talk that buzzed 
around him. The USA had entered 
the Russo-Chinese war with a 
brigade of intervention that grew to 
several armies within several days. 
Brain-missiles had been dispatched 
from China aimed at West Coast 
cities, but a new defensive system 
had neutralized them over the 
Pacific. People repeated stories 
about windstorm damage and tidal 
waves — consequences of those 
H-explosions. Then Betty came and 
chewed back her tears as she held 
his hand. Good old Betty. Then, 
one time, nurses gossiped bitchily at 
the foot of his bed about that new 
security complex near the com- 
pound, saying it was a regular 
whorehouse, with people paid to 

PLUTONIUM 


make love in there on Friday nights. 
Inwardly Clark smiled. He knew 
what went on in that hexagonal 
building. It was a hush-hush 
psycho-station, set up here to pre- 
vent Chink bombing of those 
cursed, damned, boiling vats 
.... Well, he’d soon be free of 
all that and go where you went 
when it was all said and done. 
Then, one time, he thought he saw 
Aspic hovering over the bed in 
company of a short, bald man who 
wore thick rimless glasses and 
seemed familiar to Clark. It was a 
fantasy, of course, but nevertheless 
Clark forgave Aspic everything. No 
point in holding grudges, not any 
more. Death dissolves everything. 
And finally they stood by his 
bed — Fredrick and Gerald, his stal- 
wart sons. One of them wore a uni- 
form. Clark tried to nod to them, 
to encourage them, but he couldn’t 
move his head. 

That night he died and went up 
into paradise. 

★ ★ ★ 

“Fantastic,” Aspic said, and by 
his side Cam Templar nodded. 

They stood before a wall com- 
pletely filled with tiny rectangles, 
each one closed off by thick, curved 
panelejttes of glass. Minute bits of 
light glowed inside some of these 
miniature aquaria, one flame per 
cubicle — but these lights weren’t 
fish and they didn’t swim in water. 
They were souls suspended in 
super-cooled nitrogen and held by 
subtle magnetic fields. 

Aspic saw his own image re- 
flected from the curved glass panes, 
a little bent and very much di- 

27 



mini shed by the small surfaces. Age 
sat on him lightly — at least judging 
by appearances. His hair was com- 
pletely white by now, but it hadn’t 
thinned at all. His long face was 
powerfully tanned and gave him a 
youngish look accented with thin 
white rayings of maturity around the 
eyes and a kind of tightness about 
the skin. While other people wrin- 
kled in old age, his skin appeared to 
shrink, giving him a haggard look. 

He wished he felt as young as he 
appeared, but he didn’t. Now, in 
this moment of completion, he 
wondered about the cost of all 
this — not the money cost, of course. 
The Feds had provided most of that. 
But the psychic cost lay on him 
heavily — all those meetings, all 
those lunches, all those favors ren- 
dered, all that talk, all those trips 
to Washington, a thousand Congres- 
sional hearings, ten thousand back- 
room discussions. 

A new light blinked on and drew 
Aspic’s attention. Almost im- 
mediately a telephone rang some- 
where. Templar moved off to an- 
swer it. The time was early morning 
and in this part of the complex all 
the clerical help had retired many 
hours ago. He watched Templar 
from the back, a short, old little 
man. Templar was eight years his 
junior but looked fifteen years 
older — white of complexion, fading, 
nearly blind despite those heavy 
lenses. After a moment Templar 
came back. 

He pointed to the rectangle that 
had just lit up, nodded. “That’s 
him,” he said. 

Aspic watched the micro-flame. 
He was thinking about motives. 

All around him sprawled this 

28 


complex, the first of its kind in the 
world, the only one of its kind. Its 
evolution and development had tak- 
en three decades, some of the best 
physicists in the world, a tremendous 
amount of public money, and all of 
Aspic’s persuasive powers. It work- 
ed. It was the culmination of a life 
of labor. And yet it was just the 
first step. Many such centers would 
be built in time. The Perpetual 
Priesthood would rise from these 
centers, would be replenished 
through their' mediations — provided, 
of course, that the goddamned war 
didn’t stop progress altogether. The 
war had come at the worst possible 
time. From now on a man wouldn’t 
get a hearing in Washington about 
domestic programs. Best to lie low, 
in fact, lest someone discover how 
much this facility cost to run and 
the kind of talent it employed. The 
budget cutters would have a ball de- 
spite AEC protests. Lie low. Take a 
vacation. 

Yes, he’d take off, get away 
from all this. The job was done. 
The motive that had started this ball 
rolling had been satisfied. It burned 
there, that tiny little thing. Clark, or 
whatever was left of the man. He 
had triggered the idea, he and some 
acid memories of a concentration 
camp. And now Clark sat in his 
own little prison. He glimmered in 
there, longing to incarnate, tortured 
by desire, sensing the copulations of 
the entire region in the air . but 
he couldn’t dissolve himself in 
flesh, he’d have to hang there sus- 
pended between two existences — a 
spiritual terror of unspeakable 
menace, according to Templar. 
Templar knew these things. 

Sooner or later, Aspic told him- 

GALAXY 



self, it was bound to happen. 
Sooner or later someone was bound 
to learn to control soul energies. 
And we did it, Cam and I! 

Nothing mysterious, really; just 
the same old physics in another 
guise, just the same old mathema- 
tics oriented to another dimension. 

Not that they knew much about 
it, Aspic reflected. They had found 
the tip of the iceberg. They knew 
how to hold the souls and how to 
condition them to some extent. 
When it was all over, Clark, or 
whatever was left of Clark, would 
have a powerful compulsion to stay 
near radiation, wastes. He’d have an 
abiding love for the stuff. He’d 
worship it. He’d feel possessive 
about it. He’d seek it out wherever it 
occurred. His senses would guide 
him to it. 

Or that, at any rate, had been the 
outcome of some experiments with 
short-lived fruit flies. You couldn’t 
generalize too much, of course. 

“How long have these been in- 
cubating,” Aspic asked, sweeping 
the wall with a gesture. Thirty little 
flames burned behind glass. Not 
counting Clark, all the deaths had 
occurred within a fifty-mile radius, 
the range of the magnets. They 
were all sexually screened, all of 
them souls with masculine tenden- 
cies. 

“It varies,” Templar said. “The 
oldest ones are two weeks old.” 

“So tomorrow. ?” 

“Tomorrow we’ll incarnate them. 
We’ve got another batch of volun- 
teers assembled, so it should go 
smoothly.” 

“Las Vegas tourists again?” 

“Mostly,” Templar answered, 
“although we’ve had to reach 

plutonium 


farther out this time. The 
war. .” 

“That damned war!” Aspic 
exploded. He reached up and rub- 
bed his eyes with long, slender fin- 
gers. After a moment he turned to 
Templar. 

“Tell you what. Cam. Now that 
we’ve got Clark on ice, I think I’ll 
take a nice, long vacation. Don’t do 
anything with him until I get back. 
I need some relaxation. These last 
few months. ...” 

He clicked his tongue and shook 
his head. “I think I’ll head south. 
Mexico City, Caracas, maybe San- 
tiago. Thank God the war is still a 
northern phenomenon. Meantime 
we’ll just let Johnny stew. It’s the 
least I can do for him.” He grinned 
suddenly. 

“Don’t overdo it,” Templar 
warned. He took off his rimless 
glasses and polished them with a 
handkerchief. “We don’t know how 
long these little pulses last.” He in- 
clined his head toward the tiny vo- 
tive candles behind glass. Then he 
looked at Aspic, his eyes a little out 
of focus. “For all we know, they 
might go out.” 

“So?” Aspic said. His dark, 
watery eyes were cold. Then he 
continued in a changed tone. “They 
don’t go out. None of the experi- 
mentals ever did. Whatever those 
little things are, they’re tenacious.” 
He reached out and touched Tem- 
plar on the shoulder. “I know what 
bothers you, old man. It’s the tor- 
ture. You’ve got a bleeding heart, 
my friend. Well, let me tell you 
something — ” 

But Aspic interrupted himself. He 
wouldn’t talk about that any more. 
It seemed a little odd to hark back 

29 



to an experience that he, Theodore 
Aspic, had never really had. 

“I’m not criticizing, Ted. 
Just . don’t overdo it.” 

“All right, all right,” Aspic said 
a little irritably, holding up his 
hands. “Let’s get someone to put 
Clark on conditioning and call it a 
night.” 

* * * 

Four weeks later Aspic drove to- 
ward Mexico City from a suburban 
estate in a rented Cadillac. He sat in 
the back with two young things he 
had hired for the duration, and now 
they were gigglingly messing inside 
his fly while the chauffeur drove 
behind a pane of glass. The head- 
light beams lifted squat, thick trees 
out of the on-rushing murk. 

Aspic sighed. He felt the old ex- 
citement, but it was entirely in his 
head. Down below nothing re- 
sponded. He reached for the 
speaker. “Faster,” he said, “Fast- 
er, faster.” The chauffeur in- 
creased the flow of gas. 

Aspic leaned back, closed his 
eyes. He conjured up memories of 
women he had possessed, went 
back and lingered on details. But it 
wouldn’t work tonight. He was too 
tired, the party had been a bore, 
he’d drunk a bit too much. 

He opened his eyes just in time 
to see an ancient indian step out 
onto the road from behind a tree. 
Instinctively the driver jerked the 
car to the left ... too far .. back 
again. Tires screamed in some kind 
of terror. Everything went up and 
down and sideways and lights and 
glass and stillness and dripping ooz- 
ing wind moved grass next to As- 
pic’s face.

Clark — who was no longer 
Clark but someone else — had to 
wait until his new brain had de- 
veloped, until he had learned to 
walk and talk and all those things. 
And even then he had to hide his 
curiosity so that his parents and 
playmates wouldn’t think him 
weird. By age three he secretly read 
old books that had chanced into the 
hands of 'these backwoods people. 
By age four he discovered at last 
which century this was. Chance had 
brought a town circular into his 
hands at the May fair, and he noted 
with great wonder that it was the 
23rd century, midway through the 
23rd, 2256 to be exact. 

How time doth fly. 

Let’s see now, he said to himself. 
I’ve been up there 250 years, which 
is something of a record, I’d guess, 
considering that most souls don’t 
last more than a month in paradise, 
maximally speaking. 

He didn’t confide his discoveries 
to anyone. He bided his time out 
there with the herds on the muta- 
grass prairie. At age fifteen he ran 
away from home, old enough and 
strong enough to fend for himself. 
As for experience, he possessed that 
of ten life times. 

His current name was Tankers 
Jack. His father’s name was Justins 
Tanker. They had called his grand- 
father Portos Justin . and so on 
and so forth. His mother’s name 
was Tankers Two and people called 
her Twodie. She was younger than 
Tankers One and older than Tankers 
three, and she ran away at age 
thirty-five and became Wallies

Oneish. Wally was a mutant and 
couldn’t be choosy. 

For reasons he still couldn’t en- 
tirely comprehend (birth had dis- 
oriented him slightly), he had 
selected for himself a slender, long- 
ish body with sensitive digits and 
large, dark, moist eyes. He took af- 
ter Twodie rather than Justins Tank- 
er, a large, bony man who never 
spoke except with fist and boot but 
could toss a lasso with the finesse 
of a 20th century conductor urging 
pianissimo. 

Jack knew all these people — from 
way back. 

His father had been his grandson 
in 18th century Turkey. His mother 
had been his husband in revolution- 
ary France — although at that time 
Jack had been a Jaqueline. Others 
in the village also belonged to his 
circle. He had been drawn down to 
them — to Betty, who was the 
Healer’s ageing mother and who’d 
soon make the passage again; to 
Freddy, his son, who’d surfaced as 
his brother; and yet others he had 
known, closely or remotely, in 
many pasts. He recognized them in- 
stantly given his third eye — an in- 
visible ‘eye,’ to be sure, not one of 
those mutant aberrations. 

But he hadn’t seen Evelyn any- 
where! and above all he longed to 
see her. He knew he’d see Walk- 
on-air again. Besides it didn’t mat- 
ter, Walk-on-air was everywhere. 

★ ★ ★ 

He arrived in Perpetual, New 
Mexico five years older and much 
wiser about the 23rd century. 

He came in by what was left of 
the ancient road, a young man with 

PLUTONIUM 


a flashing eye, black hair. He wore 
a tall, round hat with a stiff, wide 
rim. His legs and lower body were 
wrapped in long strips of rough, 
grey cotton tied at intervals with 
leather bands. His trunk was cov- 
ered by a woven blanket with a 
hole in the center for his head. 
Around his shoulder hung a carry- 
sack and from his left ear a golden 
ring. 

He walked toward Plutonium, a 
tiny figure next to the monstrous 
construction that now occupied the 
site of the coumpound: a proud 
monastic fortress of tremendous 
pods and walls and parapets, circled 
with moats of steaming atomic lava, 
drawbridges over the moats, pen- 
nants on the pod-tips, and a bright 
glitter of prayer ribbons in the 
wind. Crowds of pilgrims waited 
for entry next to one of the bridges, 
and Jack saw people from all cor- 
ners of this region. He saw monks 
in twentieth century garb, a shock- 
ingly nostalgic sight amidst this 
primitive but powerful architecture. 
In twenty years Jack had become 
accustomed to cowls, jerkins, 
wrap-me-ups, and — if you were rich 
and a townsman — embroidered, 
ankle-length coats. 

Perpetual itself, five or six kemits 
beyond Plutonium as the carry-crow 
flew, was ‘perpetual’ in name 
alone, for nothing had remained the 
same except a bit of the layout. A 
city wall ringed the place, but not 
as massive or as well maintained as 
he’d seen elsewhere on his travels. 
Perpetual needed no protection, not 
with the monastery nearby. 

He stopped at the very first inn 
he came to, the House of the Nu- 
cleon, complete with a hand-painted 

31 



sign out front showing little flames 
moving in a spiral. 

This being afternoon and the 
place empty, the proprietor himself 
took an interest in Jack, served him 
a foaming mug of warmish beer and 
talked about Plutonium, his elbows 
on the bar. 

The place was unique, the pro- 
prietor said. No other monastic foun- 
dation like it existed anywhere on 
earth, the man said, setting Jack to 
musing. 

By “earth” Jack knew the man 
to mean the continental United 
States, the North American land, 
for the institutional thing had passed 
away in the wake of the Russo- 
Chinese Intervention, soon after the 
brain-missiles of all the nations had 
learned to communicate telepathi- 
cally and had conspired to bring the 
whole damn rotting mess down in 
one glorious Armaggedon. Well, 
they had both failed and succeeded. 
The old world had suddenly passed 
away. But Man had survived and 
began to fill up all the spots again. 
Too bad for the Old Order. It had 
been much more varied and rich 
than this primitive culture of towns, 
herdsmen, farmers, and brigands. 
But Jack couldn’t blame the brains, 
not really. What is a man to do 
when he can sense and think and 
feel and desire — and has a missile 
for a body? 

He returned his attention to the 
Inn’s proprietor who, in the twen- 
tieth century, would have been 
urged to try Scope. The man was 
telling him about the marvellous 
power of Plutonium to attract disci- 
ples. The life up there was hard and 
dangerous. They didn’t touch wom- 
en and lived in narrow cells just 

32 


barely wide enough to let a man lie 
down. Many of them died from 
strange and mysterious sores. It was 
known all over Shashtuk country 
and well beyond. Yet young men 
came from all over, about Jack’s 
age, usually, and they had a burn- 
ing desire for that life up there. 
“God is great,” the proprietor said, 
bowing his bald head rimmed by 
black hair. 

Then he looked up and asked 
Jack if he was one of them. 

“I might be,” Jack answered 
with a smile. 

“Those who are, know!" the 
man said seriously. 

Jack made a note to remember 
that when he approached Plu- 
tonium’s masters. He recalled 
the compulsion-creating condition- 
ing process of his early days of 
spirit incarceration. But that com- 
pulsion had been wiped away by the 
existential terrors he had experi- 
enced during months of suspension 
between two lives, the very experi- 
ence ancient catholics must have 
had in mind by the fires of purga- 
tory. He had been purged, all right. 
His energy identity had been forced 
to contemplate itself, hour after 
hour, through what seemed a hand- 
ful of eternities. He’d come to 
memorize his past, to imprint it in- 
delibly on his deepest awareness. 
Then someone had released him at 
last. But instead of incarnating with 
alacrity, Jack had careened off into 
the very stratospheres of paradise 
seeking recovery from his tortures. 
Fearless now, he had plunged into 
the very center of the white disc of 
light and there, abiding in healing 
solitude, he had seemed to be in 
company of Walk-on-air. By the 


GALAXY 



time he emerged to incarnate again, 
quietly, deliberately, one quarter of 
a millenium had passed away be- 
low. 

He took a swig of beer, wiped 
his mouth with the back of his 
hand, and said: “I have no money, 
innkeeper, but I’m a scribe.” 

“Welcome, welcome,” the man 
said, bowing. “Feel at home, Tan- 
kers Jack. I’ll pass out the word and 
you’ll be drowned in business. The 
last scribe came by more than a 
year ago.” 

The proprietor rubbed his hands 
with pleasure. Such luck to snag a 
scribe. His house would be full for 
weeks. He led Jack personally to 
the very best room in the house, 
lovely with its blue-white wallpaper 
obtained at great expense from a 
travelling merchant. The bed — a 
double mattress; three pillows; and 
thick, fluffy Harvey pelts for cover 
against night-chill. 

Another significant change be- 
tween that time and this, Jack noted, 
his eye on the milk-white pelts of 
the rare, disappearing giant rabbit. 
The sun seldom peeked through the 
overhead murk; volcanic ash and 
sediment circled up there around 
and around the globe. It would take 
centuries to restore illumination to 
its ancient maximum. It was cold in 
New Mexico, even in June. 

He waited until the proprietor had 
left. Gazing after the man, it occur- 
red to him that the bald fellow 
might be Cam Templar, Aspic’s as- 
trologer, but he couldn’t be sure, 
having only met Templar once, long 
ago, in Washington, D.C. If it was 
Templar, he had certainly come 
down in the world, karma-wise. 
The man’s head disappeared down 

PLUTONIUM 


the stairs, and Jack closed the door. 

He took binoculars from his 
carry-sack — he’d found the instru- 
ment in the never-used bomb-shelter 
of a destroyed estate far to the 
north, where the ice starts. He 
walked to the window. He lifted the 
binoculars toward Plutonium on the 
horizon and searched the monas- 
tery’s silhouette until he spied, barely 
visible, six baskets of wire high up 
between the pods. Passing by the 
massive complex, he hadn’t been 
able to see them. But they were 
there. 

Once upon a time he had thought 
them radar dishes. 

* ★ ★ 

After four days of reading and 
writing letters — hundreds of 
letters — Jack decided to take a holi- 
day. His earnings had been good, 
the people generous. They liked the 
way he dramatized the messages 
from relatives far and wide, the way 
his eyes twinkled when he read 
funny things and the way his voice 
choked up when he catalogued 
woes. 

The Innkeeper hired four extra 
girls to keep the beer and the meat 
flowing, but all too often he caught 
them dreamily admiring the scribe 
from the edge of the perpetual circle 
of people around him. He also sus- 
pected that they slipped into his 
room at night for more substantial 
samples of his passion — but the Inn- 
keeper need not have worried or 
envied, whichever it was. Jack 
waited for one girl and only one. 
He thought he’d earned her affec- 
tion at last, and the mysterious 
forces of cosmic magnetism would 

33 



sooner or later sweep her into his 
path. 

He borrowed a horse from the 
Innkeeper’s stable and rode away in 
an ancient direction toward night- 
fall. He had chosen a Wednesday 
night for this venture — for old 
times’ sake. 

The horse plodded forward weari- 
ly, its heavy head going up and 
down, tired from dragging shaped 
concrete slabs all day from a nearby 
gorge overpass ruined ages ago but 
serving now as a kind of quarry. In 
its place now hung a spidery rope- 
board thing, a graceful curve above 
the abyss. 

Up above the moon was a diffu- 
sion of light in an atmosphere 
loaded with suspended particles. 
Down below the ground was far 
more lush, a swaying grass-scape, a 
rolling prairie of mutagrass. 

In place of the upright cacti Jack 
found a willow with its hair hanging 
low. Near the tree sat Walk-on-air, 
an ancient, wrinkled indian with 
jet-black hair pulled into a braid in 
the back. His eyes -were closed. He 
sat facing the spot where the setting 
sun had caused a dirty brown line 
of light between sky and ground. 

Jack dismounted and sat down 
near the chief to wait. 

After a while the chief opened 
one eye. It twinkled merrily, its 
white a little yellow. He opened the 
other eye and broke into a huge 
grin. 

“Hello, old friend.’’ 

“Hello, Chief Walk-on-air. ” 

“You’ve done right well for 
yourself,” the chief said, gesturing 
toward Jack. “A nice combination 
you’ve concocted. A bit of the 
gypsy in you, a bit of the hero, nice 

34 


and slender but strong in the wrist 
and the arm; your eyes are very ex- 
pressive, and the nose hints a little 
at carnivorous birds. That golden 
earring gives you a mysterious air, 
the lips are sensuous to the right 
degree. The hair is straight, yet at 
the ends, it has a kind of graceful 
curl. No doubt you’re an ac- 
complished singer, swordsman, and 
story-teller too, can read men’s 
palms and see the future in goblets 
of dark wine. Am I right?” 

“You knovf' everything. Chief 
Walk-on-air.” 

“On the contrary, Tankers 
Jack — a kind of racy name, that, I 
must say. No, no, my friend. I wal- 
low in blissful ignorance. She’s al- 
ways unfolding, always unfolding 
like a flower that forever germinates 
into the future. There is no end to 
her mysteries.” 

“Who is she?” 

“The Cosmic Flower, the Abso- 
lute Change.” 

“I thought there was nothing 
beyond you, Chief.” 

The indian laughed, his head 
thrown back. He was thoroughly 
amused. He chortled and chuckled. 

“Tankers Jack,” he said at last, 
wiping his eye, “you’re an incorrigi- 
ble Barbarian. You’ve been inside 
the brilliant light — yet you returned 
to earth. For what? A woman. 
Right?” 

“You have all the answers, 
Chief.” 

“Listen to me, old friend. Do 
you know what happens to people 
who go into that brilliant light when 
it appears in paradise? People who 
don’t get frightened and don’t shy 
away toward the red of the spec- 
trum?” 


GALAXY 



“I don’t, Chief.” 

“They become angels, Tankers 
Jack. They go up into higher lives. 
They tum into planets and -suns. But 
you — you came back for a woman. 
And then you ask me whether there 
is anything beyond me. 1 also wor- 
ship a woman. There is always 
something beyond. Otherwise we’d 
all curl up and die.” 

Jack’s horse blew air through its 
nostrils with a low blurb and 
stamped a leg. 

“Since I have, as you say, 
thrown away a chance at angelic 
existence,” Jack said, “let me tum 
to petty practicalities. When will I 
see her?” 

Chief Walk-on-air laughed. 
“What’s the hurry, Jack? You’ve 
waited three hundred years or more. 
What’s a decade or two or even a 
life or two.” 

“Chief,” Jack said tensely, 
nearly rising from his cross-legged 
position, “don’t you tease me. I 
couldn’t possibly wait decades — 
much less lives!” 

Chief Walk-on-air chortled, bub- 
bled. Tears ran down his wrinkled 
cheeks. He pointed a gnarled finger. 
“Look at you,” he said, “just look 
at you. I can’t get over it. Here you 
are, all got up to kill, a heart-throb. 
My God, Jack, how do you keep 
the ladies from your bed? But when 
I see you, I see old Clark sitting 
there like a pile of misery, his 
beer-gut coming out to here\ Oh, 
Spirits, oh, Flower!” 

“When?” Jack demanded cross- 
ly. He felt totally at ease with 
Walk-on-air. They had shared an 
eternity together in the brilliance. 

“All right, all right,” the chief 
said. “How can a god refuse any- 

PLUTONIUM 


thing to a mortal like you.” He nar- 
rowed his eyes half mockingly. 
“The time is ripe. It’ll happen 
soon. But there is still a wee-little- 
bitty bad karma clinging to you. 
Tankers Jack. You haven’t scraped 
away quite all of it. Those spirit- 
catchers are still up there — and 
you’re responsible for them. A 
word to the wise. ?” 

“And then?” 

“And then the nefarious and 
strange ways of the Lady Flower 
will guide you in magical ways into 
her presence,” the chief pro- 
nounced. “After that it’ll be up to 
you, of course. I can’t guarantee a 
thing. I wallow in blissful igno- 
rance. I sit here and wait for the 
next marvel that may drop from her 
hand.” 

“Why here?” Jack demanded. 
“And why sitting? Why don’t you 
wander about like I do. You see 
more things that way.” 

“Because,” the chief said, and 
he grinned broadly, “because 
you’re just a young god and I’m an 
old one. One or two stories a mil- 
leniurn are quite sufficient for me. 
The doctor tells me not to get too 
excited, you know. If I overdo it, I 
might become an angel.” 

With that the chief threw back his 
head and laughed most merrily. 

VI 

The siren shrieked and echoed 
through the intricately laid corridors 
of Central Pod. It called upon the 
brotherhood to rise. Plutonium’s 
day had begun. 

Jack awoke with a start and al- 
most sat up straight. He remem- 
bered himself in time and, accus- 

35 



tomed to the maneuver by now, he 
slid from his vault-like chamber feet 
first. He landed in the corridor and 
reached for his clothing. Monks 
dressed on all sides of him, slipping 
into jeans, shirts, sweaters, or sweat 
shirts — the obligatory uniform of 
the monastery. 

It was Jack’s fifteenth day in 
Plutonium. 

He had arrived, had slipped into 
the monastery almost without 
notice, just another novice, just 
another compulsive come to seek 
satisfaction at the bosom of God. 
He had come, but he had not yet 
conquered. 

This day, the fifteenth, would roll 
by like the others. And then would 
come another, and then another. 
The ordinary mortal, Jack told him- 
self, would long have lost his pa- 
tience with all this and told his pre- 
cious karma to go hang, but he was 
not an ordinary man and so he 
stayed on, waiting for his opportuni- 
ty. 

He dressed, like the others, and 
took an inventory of his situation. 

Many levels above him, sealed 
off by guards, was what the monks 
called The Mystery. Many levels 
below him, in the ancient arti- 
cavems, the members of the Hierar- 
chy would now be preparing for the 
one and only ceremony of the day. 
A few levels above them, at ground 
level, others of the Hierarchy would 
be cutting bread into small pieces 
for the breakfast that would follow, 
a humble, monastic meal. A 
hundred kemits to the south of here, 
a monkish caravan would be load- 
ing tents and setting the missile into 
motion again. The missile, so he 
understood, rested on two long carts 


tied end to end, and the carts were 
drawn by sixteen oxen. The mis- 
sile, presumably, would be chatter- 
ing in its mad way. 

That described his situation fairly 
concisely. 

He finished dressing and won- 
dered how long it would take for 
sixteen oxen to cover a hundred 
kemits. Ten days? Twenty days? He 
hoped it was ten days at most. Even 
a man with the patience of Job 
would want to escape this lunatic 
complex — especially if a girl 
awaited somewhere in the future 
beyond the moats of Plutonium. 

Jack joined other monks and 
walked along the corridor toward 
spiralling stairs that led to the 
depths beneath the complex. This 
corridor, like those in most build- 
ings nowadays, coiled unpredictably 
through the building. The total 
darkness was eased only by ancient 
phosphorescent paint, delivered here 
ages ago for disposal, which these 
latter-day guardians of radiation had 
smeared liberally on the walls. The 
paint bathed corridor and monks in 
an eerie, greenish light. 

The missile bothered Jack in 
more ways than one. On the one 
hand, he might be counting on it far 
too much. On the other, it was a 
missile. The brain in it was still 
alive, and if the brain lived its other 
parts might still be functional. It 
was a legacy from the twentieth 
century, a token affection sent down 
through time. He couldn’t even start 
to guess hdw the brain had sur- 
vived. Few mechanical objects had 
escaped the ravages of time. Cars 
were heaps of rust, batteries dead, 
ballpoints dry. Only Aspic’s Mys- 
tery still ran, that much was 


36 


GALAXY 



evident — and this nuclear bomb 
lifted by sweepers from a lake in 
what had been Texas. They had 
made those babies to endure. Jack 
reflected. They probably ran off 
solar energy with a sealed-in life- 
support system to maintain the 
brain-mass, a super-duper stainless 
steel ecology — and now it jabbered 
nonsense through an amplifier at- 
tached to its underside. Take that 
back. It didn’t chatter nonsense all 
the time. From time to time it 
pleaded with its finders to drop it 
from a mountain onto rocks. When 
it was sane, it wished to die, in 
other words. When sanity left it, it 
spoke about Armageddon, a woman 
named Hester, and a child called 
Tom, 

What hath God wrought! 

Jack reached the stairs and went 
down, hands on the railing. His 
mind continued to turn around the 
missile. 

Word of the thing had come three 
days ago. Excited messengers had 
burst into Plutonium with the good 
news. A group of sweepers had dis- 
covered a Godbod larger than any 
found heretofore. On top of that, 
this Godbod had a voice and said 
odd things — prophecies, some of the 
i messengers claimed; others, more 
| sober or less imaginative, said it 
| merely spouted odd gibberish. Jack 
| had gone to interview all the mes- 
sengers he could find, and with 
some reluctance had concluded that 
; the thing was a brain-missile all 
right. Now, going down around and 
around the spiral staircase, he won- 
dered if he had miscalculated the ef- 
fect it would have. 

News of this Godbod had sent 
Waves of shock through Plutonium. 

plutonium 


Most of the ordinary monks lived in 
total idleness. They neither spun nor 
wove. The first hour of the day was 
structured by the ceremony. 
Thereafter, unless a man belonged 
to the Hierarchy, he could spend his 
time any way he wished. Plutonium 
by day or night was a savage 
battlefield of roaming ‘ gangs. 
Battle-sounds could be heard 
throughout the complex, cries, 
blows, running feet, the heavy breath- 
ing of men. The victors usually 
raped the youngest of the van- 
quished. Such would be the fif- 
teenth day, such had been the first, 
the second, and all the rest — with 
one exception. 

On the day when the messengers 
had arrived, Plutonium had buzzed 
like a hive stirred by a stick. News 
of a talking Godbod had put a stop 
to the usual amusements of the 
brotherhood. Men had gathered in 
excited clumps, discussing the 
event, and groups had formed spon- 
taneously to plan the reception. Jack 
had concluded that such excitement 
would be magnified many times 
when the missile actually arrived, 
and while the brothers swarmed out 
to greet this new find, he hoped to 
be upstairs, communing with the 
Mystery. He hoped, at least, that 
security upstairs would be greatly 
relaxed. Otherwise, as he had dis- 
covered, it would be nearly impos- 
sible to approach Aspic’s satanic 
machine. 

But what if they didn’t relax the 
guard? What then? 

From down below Jack could 
hear the roar of voices. The monks 
gathered in Cavern B, as it had 
been called in the old days, the 
largest of the storage areas. By the 

37 



time Jack reached the place, the 
cavern had filled up with monks, a 
. huge assembly, a sea of heads mov- 
ing and humming. Above them he 
could see, in the distance, the abbot 
and several ministrants preparing for 
the ceremony. Baskets of hot rocks 
stood on the platform, and minis- 
trants arranged themselves beside 
them. The abbot, wearing asbestos 
gloves, placed a silvery canister 
centrally on the altar. Torches stuck 
into holders mounted on the wall 
behind him threw the only light in 
the cavernous, echoing room. Their 
flames reflected on rows of vats on 
either side. Hot sludges boiled and 
bubbled inside those giant pots, just 
starting on the first leg of that 
250,000 year journey toward ionic 
exhaustion. 

The abbot raised his hands high 
into the air. A hush fell on the 
monks. The best part of their day 
would now begin. After the chant- 
ing and the reading were over, the 
ministrants would bring the baskets 
through the throng. Each monk 
would take a rock. Ceremony called 
for a ritual kiss followed by a touch 
of forehead, throat, navel, and 
gonads with the rocks. Most of the 
monks went well beyond this re- 
quirement. They hugged those 
clumps of mineral. They rubbed 
them over their bodies. Contact 
with the rocks, which had been ex- 
posed to high-level radiation, satis- 
fied some deep need in these miser- 
able men. 

Jack noted his own position and 
moved to his right, toward the wall. 
In the center of the throng, the 
ministrants would certainly pass 
closely by him, and he tried to 
avoid what all the rest had come to 

38 


enjoy — exposure to the radiation. 
He felt a surge of pity for the 
monks. He couldn’t help them. 
They had been conditioned, once 
and for all; their bodies needed 
something biology knew nothing 
about. But future generations had to 
be protected from this obscene slav- 
ery. Jack wondered briefly whether 
it was really true — that he, himself, 
by a series of rash acts in. a con- 
centration camp, had set in motion 
the horror he witnessed on every 
hand: these .savage men covered 
with sores and lesions. Could one 
man, with one act, leave such a leg- 
acy of trauma? 

The abbot started chanting in a 
reedy voice, and an ocean of voices 
answered him, a deep, male lowing 
that rose and fell. Jack looked up 
and watched the altar. From his 
new perspective by the wall, in un- 
comfortable proximity to one of the 
vats, he could now see a large 
group of monks on the platform. 
They were sweepers awaiting the 
abbot’s blessing before setting out. 
Each carried a small box, sack, or 
bottle. Discovery of the missile had 
put new vigor into sweeping. Now 
everyone was eager to find a God- 
bod even more magnificent than the 
talking needle. 

Jack eyed the sweepers on the 
platform. Sweepers had been his 
first encounter with Plutonium. He 
had seen them in all parts of the 
country during his wanderings, 
wretched creatures combing the 
countryside, sniffing for radiation as 
they went, trusting their compul- 
sions to lead them to the holy stuff 
wherever it was, however deep or 
however high, yes, even on the bot- 
tom of lakes. They carried bits of 


GALAXY 1 


hot stuff with them. Without those 
bits of inoculation, compulsions 
tlrove them back to Plutonium. He 
had seen them huddled beside an- 
cient freeways in miserable camps; 
he had seen them begging food, 
standing in the middle of village 
streets, and he had seen women 
j throwing them bread from a safe 
distance. The common people un- 
derstood Plutonium in their way. 
They knew that sickness followed 
the monks. They hurried them 
along, out of the hamlet, away from 
the cattle. Holy sickness, to be 
sure. But move along, please. 

The chant died out in a final, 
multitonal hum, beautiful in its 
way — would have been beautiful 
had Jack not known the unholy de- 
sire that gave it such feeling. 
Across the distance from the altar now 
came the abbot’s voice, reading the 
scriptures. The echoing hall swal- 
lowed some of the words, but Jack 
knew what the abbot was saying. 
He spoke about God’s ineffable pre- 
sence in the room. He blessed this 
Holy Interface where divinity was 
operative. He spoke of vigilance 
and of the evil world without, 
where Godbod’s holy emanations 
didn’t reach. The words were lame, 
without much cadence. A contrac- 
tor’s analyst had written the text try- 
ing to beat a deadline, no doubt. 
But neither scriptures nor dogma 
mattered much, Jack knew. The real 
faith burned in the monks’ 
entrails — an implanted compulsion. 
The software didn’t play a role so 
long as the hardware worked. When 
your innards wrench and tear you, 
you don’t need much of a theology. 

Jack could feel the growing ex- 
citement. Greedy eyes devoured the 

PLUTONIUM 


baskets from a distance. The read- 
ing would be over soon. Jack slip- 
ped away, between two vats, and 
sought the deeper darkness of a re- 
cess in the wall. He pressed into it 
and felt, against his back, heavy 
studs that, in the old days, had held 
the radiation shields in place. They 
had been removed, of course. From 
this vantage point he could glimpse, 
between the vats, the progress of 
the ceremony, the pathetic antics of 
the monks, the vigilance of minis- 
trants. 

Theft of an irradiated rock was 
considered a capital offense. Once a 
day, and once a day only, were 
monks allowed to feel the 
particles — granted, of course, that 
the whole hive was hot, up to the 
very last pennant cracking in the 
wind above the highest pod. 

The ministrants came down and 
then moved back, collecting the 
rocks as they went. Jack faded back 
into the crowd and watched the ab- 
bot lift on high the shining canister 
in a final blessing. Then he turned 
and blessed the sweepers, where- 
upon a ministrant approached them 
and handed over bits of Godbod for 
their boxes, sacks and bottles. 

The ceremony was over, but the 
monks stood their guard, not a man 
moving. It was like this every 
morning. They felt the Lord’s peace 
in the cavern. They didn’t want to 
leave. The vats threw out emana- 
tions, and they gloried in the feel- 
ing. But enough was enough. The 
ministrants now turned policemen 
and began to press the crowd to- 
ward the exit carrying clubs in their 
hands. Jack felt a surge of hunger. 
He went out and up the stairs to- 
ward the eating halls.

★ * ★ 

Jack sat on a bench against the 
wall next to some monks he knew. 
These men were of the pious sort, a 
small percentage of Plutonium’s 
population, simple creatures who 
took the doctrine seriously, shunned 
gangs, and spent their days in little 
prayer chambers strewn about the 
complex reading the scriptures hung 
from the wall by chains. Jack had 
associated himself with these men. 
His piercing look and a regal man- 
ner he had assumed had protected 
him from violence and rape. He put 
about also that he was a Hierarchy 
spy, which helped. But he found it 
best, like any other beast of the 
jungle, to fade into a herd of others 
to fend off predators. These men 
were the least offensive of all those 
in the hive. 

Jack munched his piece of bread 
and a single carrot. He turned to the 
man on his left, a w hi spy creature 
by name of Johns Jim. 

“Jim,” he said, “any news about 
the Prophet?” (“Prophet” was one 
name for the new discovery, “nee- 
dle” another.) 

“I don’t know,” Jim said. “You 
should have better information.” He 
whispered: “You’re with the 

Hierarchy. But I feel it,” he con- 
tinued in a normal voice. He 
pointed to his stomach. “I feel it 
here. It’s coming closer.” 

“How many days do you think 
it’ll take?” Jack asked. 

Jim didn’t have a chance to an- 
swer. At that moment a man burst 
into the room to their right and ran 
between benches toward the only 
table in the hall, to their left, where 


the abbot sat taking his breakfas 
flanked by high officials o 
Plutonium. 

The man was tall, haggard and 
although he wore dark clothing, i 
was evident immediately that h< 
was blood-stained. His eyes shorn 
with a kind of craze. 

He arrived at the abbot’s tabh 
and leaned across it without the cus 
tomary handshake which, no longe 
used as a form of greeting in the 
twenty-third century, was still ai 
obligatory courtesy in Plutonium. 

Jack saw the man whispering t< 
the abbot, and then the abbot fel 
back in his chair as if he had sus 
tained a blow. In a second he, in 
turn, whispered into the ear of his 
cheif aide who, in his tum, gave 
evidence of shocked dismay. j 

The two men rose and gestured tc 
the leadership. Then, in a body, the 
whole group left, taking the haggarc 
man along. 

This brief scene caused unusual 
excitement in the brotherhood. The 
monks occupied several halls the 
size of this one, strung out end tc 
end in a circle along the girth of 
Central Pod. The word spread 
quickly through all the rooms, and 
in minutes excited groups had 
formed, discussing, speculating. 
Men were sent running to check 
with their contacts in the Hierarchy. 
To Jack it seemed like a replay of 
the scene some days ago when the 
missile’s discovery had been an- 
nounced. 

A half hour later — the monks 
were still milling in the eating 
hall — the word finally filtered out. 
Johns Jim, who had run off to con- 
sult with the deputy assistant 
theologian, a friend of his, brought 


40 


GALAXY! 


back news to Jack’s group. His 
thin, grey face was long as he ap- 
proached, his mouth half open in 
the anticipation of speech. 

“They stole it,” he called before 
even reaching his group. “They got 
it. They’re all dead. It’s gone.” 

The pious monks enclosed him 
in a circle. Then, in fits and starts, 
the story came out. A large armed 
party of unknown affiliation had at- 
tacked the triumphant caravan bring- 
ing the needle home. The monkish 
escort had been slaughtered. I alone 
am escaped to tell thee. That, in es- 
sence, had been the haggard man’s 
story. The world had intervened and 
stolen Godbod, Plutonium’s most 
cherished capture in a hundred 
years. 

Jack cursed inwardly at the news. 
He saw his plans for action foiled. 
No missile, no excitement. No 
thronging mass would leave 
Plutonium to meet the double-car 
and the sixteen oxen. His face, like 
that of the others, turned long and 
sad, but his sadness came from 
another source. 

Then, in an eye-wink, the situa- 
tion changed abruptly. 

Movements in Plutonium were 
coordinated with a siren, a hand- 
cranked affair. It announced the 
morning service and also feeding 
times at noon and in the evening. In 
fifteen days Jack had heard only a 
single siren, a very unpleasant 
sound, but tolerable. Now, slicing 
through the air toward him came the 
sound of several sirens, all operat- 
ing at a different pitch. The sound 
was so piercing he involuntarily cov- 
ered his ears and bent his head. 
This was a new phenomenon. He 
divined at once that it was an 

PLUTONIUM 


emergency call. He had judged cor- 
rectly. The monks around were 
electrified into motion. They ran for 
the exits and crashed through them, 
nearly trampling one another. The 
eating hall was suddenly empty. 
Only Jack stood against the wall, 
his eyes on a sea of wooden 
benches. 

The sirens stopped as suddenly as 
they had started, and now he could 
hear the thunder of feet descending 
stairs. The floor of the hall trembled 
slightly from multiple impacts. 

He waited until the sound had 
died down. Then, with cool resolu- 
tion, he turned and went the other 
way, up toward the roof of Central 
Pod. He knew that his chance had 
come at last. The waiting was over, 
and he could act. 

He saw no one on the stairs go- 
ing up. No one in the corridors that 
led toward the Mystery. Jack 
couldn’t believe it, but it was true. 
He had been prepared to deal with 
opposition if he had to. Ten life- 
times had taught him many murder- 
ous arts. But there was no need. 
When all the sirens were let loose 
to wail through Plutonium like de- 
sert ghouls gone mad, all men were 
called from their posts, apparently, 
even those above, those who had 
blocked his access in days past. 

He walked freely into the re- 
stricted area. He stood before a 
door. On the other side of it he 
heard a faint hum, a hum he hadn’t 
heard in this era. He looked to right 
and left. Still no one around. His 
hand depressed the handle. The 
door opened a crack, then more, 
then all the way. He stepped in. 

Consoles stood around the 
room — a room that had been 

41 



moved, intact, from the ancient 
security complex to the top of 
Plutonium by God knew what exer- 
tions or when. Here electrical 
lights, presumably fed from nuclear 
reactors made to last, glowed dimly 
overhead. The floor was plastic. 
Bright metal gleamed everywhere. 
Against- one wall scores of tiny 
flames glowed behind glass panelet- 
tes. They gave Jack a nauseous 
pulse of remembrance. 

His eyes a little wild, he looked 
about and found what he needed, a 
large polished rock used as a 
paperweight on a desk. He took the 
stone and went toward the panels. 
He hesitated before setting to work. 
He was about to destroy a strange, 
unique technology, perhaps Western 
Man’s last great breakthrough. It 
might never be invented again. It 
would be a loss to Science, the sci- 
ence of some future. But his hesita- 
tion was brief. Tiny flames flick- 
ered before him, souls in transi- 
tion, karmic fires. He took a deep 
breath and began to free them, one 
by one. Broken glass fell at his feet 
and cold gas hissed around his 
hands, covering his arm with artifi- 
cial rime. 

vn 

Discovery of the savage destruc- 
tion went through Plutonium like 
another great convulsion. By that 
time Jack had long disappeared into 
the country, clad like a scribe 
again, humming a tune, longing for 
Evelyn, and glad that the missile 
was lost somewhere to the south. 
For that reason, he went north. 
Monks were sent out to capture the 
criminals, but they found only pious 

42 


ladies bringing baskets of alms and 
simple pilgrims in their tents. The 
Hierarchy, meanwhile, met again to 
ponder alternatives. 

They were horror-struck and 
knew themselves mortally wounded. 
The Mystery, and it alone, re- 
plenished the priestly ranks. It was 
the heart of the cult. They tended 
the machinery with loving care. In 
ample store rooms thoughtfully fil- 
led by Old Order founders, they 
could always find the part needed to 
keep the panel lights green. Most 
often a wafer failed; sometimes a 
wire had to be replaced; more rarely 
a gas canister would run dry and a 
full one had to be snapped in its 
place. The Hierarchy had calculated 
that five centuries could pass before 
the warehouses were empty. 

But now they saw the Mystery in 
the paroxysm of death. It smoked 
amidst a wreckage of metal and 
glass. A storm had passed through 
the warehouse. A fire still raged in 
one end of it, filling the space with 
poison fumes. The cult would 
surely die — especially if some up- 
start group had a Godbod that spoke 
strange prophecies. 

After some days of agonized con- 
sultation, the abbot decided to 
mount an armed excursion — to re- 
cover Godbod; the Mystery was 
beyond help. Plutonium organized 
for war. The monkish army, ten 
thousand men or more, each carry- 
ing a bit of Godbod, led by the 
haggard messenger, moved south to 
the scene of the crime. Here inves- 
tigations were ordered, and after 
some days the army wheeled north. 
It picked up the cold trail of the 
thieves. 

The trail was difficult to follow. 

GALAXY 



The leader of the enemy, a man de- 
scribed as short, blond, sturdy, 
wide-faced, and steady, had not 
been recognized by anyone in the 
area. He had come out of nowhere, 
he and his men. People guessed he 
was a war chief attached to a city. 
They inferred this from the disci- 
pline of the men he led, the quality 
of the cloth they wore, and the sys- 
tem they had devised to move the 
giant needle toward the north. 

The leader had abandoned the 
carts and the oxen. His men had 
placed the needle into a large net 
suspended between twenty-four 
horses, twelve on each side. Sol- 
diers rode the leading and trailing 
animals on right and left. This 
method of transport was faster than 
the one the monks had used. The 
group travelled off the beaten paths. 
Plutojacks had to seek reports of 
them. Few had seen the odd if 
memorable group, a swiftly mov- 
ing, silent band — silent but for the 
silver needle in its hammock which, 
by all reports, continuously spouted 
gibberish. 

As the monkish army moved, it 
lived off the land. Discipline was 
difficult to enforce. The population 
in its path grew fearful and mounted 
resistance. But slowly, like a radiat- 
ing locust herd, Plutonium groped 
its way north. 

* * ★ 

The leader of the thieves was 
Alans Shepherd. 

In his twelfth existence he had 
accumulated much merit by a life of 
service in the cause of justice, the 
culmination of a long series Of 
evolutions to ever higher vibrational 

PLUTONIUM 


spheres. But in his thirteenth incar- 
nation, as a physicist in what was 
then the United States (of fading 
memory), he had indulged a passion 
for vengeance and had loaded him- 
self with heavy karmic debt. 

In a succession of lives since 
then, brief and violent lives they 
were, he had sunk ever lower, un- 
able to stop his downward drift, un- 
til this time, in his Shepherd incar- 
nation, darkness enveloped his 
awareness to a significant extent, 
and only bits and pieces of earlier 
light came through the chinks of his 
moral obscurity. 

One of those bits of light, though 
he didn’t know it, emanated from 
his chief and sovereign, Zeronica, 
once his daughter and once his mis- 
tress, and other things besides in a 
long existence that went back to the 
Crusades. 

She alone, of all the folk he 
knew, aroused in him a dim mem- 
ory of something higher, and he had 
served her now for several years, 
doggishly loyal, uncharacteristically 
mild. 

Returning now with his prize of 
prizes, he gave himself a little 
hope, just a tiny bit of hope, that 
she would reward his loyalty at last. 
With this final act, he would make 
her foremost among the leaders of 
the world. Now he would deserve 
the reward she had promised him, 
years ago, in the shadow of the ice. 
If she refused him this time, he 
didn’t know what he would do. 

Spurred by such motives, he 
drove his men to great exertions, 
and the group reached Phoenix long 
before the plutojacks had even or- 
ganized for systematic pursuit. He 
entered the city gates at night, in 

43 



secrecy. His men slipped the God- 
bod into the dungeons beneath the 
Presidential Pod. She came to see it 
that same night, a cloak about her 
night dress. Godbod was sleeping at 
the time and she couldn’t question 
it. Messengers had told her about 
the miraculous voice. Her manner, 
as always, was aloof and cool, and 
Shepherd went to bed that night 
with the bitter taste of disappoint- 
ment in his throat. He tried to con- 
sole himself saying he was a man of 
power and influence second to none 
in Phoenix. But the thought gave 
him no solace. In her presence he 
was still a bandit, and though he 
never let the thought flit across the 
surface of his mind, he knew that 
her eyes ruled his, now as ever. He 
tossed and turned on his lonely bed. 
She hadn’t even greeted him. Her 
first words had bit his soul deeply, 
opening wounds. “I didn’t know,” 
she had said down in the dungeon 
amidst torch flickers that echoed 
back from the dull gleam of God- 
bod’s hull. “Is this allT' she had 
asked. “It’s just a piece of metal, 
isn’t it?” 

She herself had demanded of him 
year after year, for three years at 
the least, that he should capture for 
Phoenix the one thing it lacked. 
Now that he had done it, she called 
it a piece of metal. 

The next day she had a sitting 
basket hung from the ceiling in the 
dungeon. She sat beside the needle 
and tried to hold a conversation 
with the awakened spirit within. 
This went on for two days. Then 
she sent for Shepherd and dis- 
charged her frustrations into his 
steady face, angered by Godbod ’s 
incomprehensibilities. 

44 


“You should’ve let the plutos 
have him,” she said to Shepherd at 
the end, her voice dripping with 
contempt. “He, he — ” She gestured 
at the needle, slapping the air with 
a hand slack at the wrist. “This is 
no god, Shepherd! Can’t be. Maybe 
it’s just one of those talking 
machines the old books tell about.” 

Back in his own quarters, 
Shepherd kicked the mutants. He 
stayed within for three days, drink- 
ing. He recalled his carefree life 
beneath the ice and cursed his fate. 

* * * 

Two weeks later the war caught 
up with Tankers Jack. 

Rumors had preceded it and had 
already set him to wondering. He 
was staying in a small village when 
plutojacks over-ran the hamlet. Jack 
escaped the worst of the killing. He 
knew the code words of the priest- 
hood. He mingled with the band as 
it departed, pretending to be a 
sweeper and out of touch with 
Plutonium, His appearance aroused 
no great concern. Most of the 
priests wore modern clothing ac- 
quired along the way. 

Deep in the heart of a forest in 
what had been a desert in Clark’s 
day, around a smoky fire, Jack 
learned that God himself had de- 
stroyed the Mystery, angry at the 
priesthood’s lack of vigilance. La- 
ter, as the fire fell to ashes and the 
monks lay back to sleep, an old 
priest by name of Goosers Texas, 
who had eyed Jack with interest, 
looked about, beckoned with a griz- 
zled head and a squinting eye. 
When Jack sat down beside him, 
the old man said: 


GALAXY 



“You look like an intelligent 
man, Tankers Jack. You’ll go far in 
the priesthood. You say that you 
were on a sweep when all this hap- 
pened. And these simpletons told 
you the story we of the Hierarchy 
have put about. Well, you deserve 
better, Tankers Jack. The truth is, 
God did nothing to the Mystery. A 
man destroyed it.” 

The old eyes searched for a reac- 
tion, and Jack opened his eyes in 
astonishment. 

“Yes,” said the priest, nodding 
toward the fire. “Yes, by the Holy 
Interface, we know, we of the 
Hierarchy.” 

Jack signalled his respect and 
said that secret knowledge belonged 
by rights to those who carried the 
burdens of responsibility. 

The old priest nodded and sighed. 
“Yes,” he said, “the burdens are 
heavy.” He leaned closer and whis- 
pered: “The abbot told me — ” 

“The abbot?!” Jack breathed. 

“Yes, sir,” said the priest. He 
nodded gravely. He picked up a 
stick, leaned forward with a groan, 
and threw it into the fading embers, 
evoking sparks. He sank back 
again. 

“The abbot points to the Woman 
of the North.” The monk nodded to 
himself. “She did it — her henchmen 
stole the needle.” 

Jack grew alert. A woman had 
been mentioned — a woman tied 
karmically to Plutonium. 

He told the priest that, pardon his 
ignorance, but he had never heard 
about the Woman of the North. 
What was the story? 

“Well,” said the priest, “I reck- 
on you must have been sweeping 
far to the east of here. And you 

plutonium 


mustn’t have been around these 
parts for a good many years — am I 
right?” 

Jack allowed that Goosers Texas 
was right on the button. 

The dry stick burst into a flame. 
The old man leaned forward and 
held his hands toward the heat to 
warm them. When he resumed, his 
tone had changed. He would be tel- 
ling a story. 

“Well,” he said, his old face red 
and gashed by moving shadows, 
“her name is Zeronica. An odd 
name, I’m sure you’ll grant. The 
presidents of Phoenix all called 
themselves Henry until the male 
line died out. Henry s Henry, each 
and every one of them. She was the 
daughter and only child of One- 
eyed Henry, as the people called 
him, the last of the Henries. Noth- 
ing wrong with his eyes, you un- 
derstand. But he squinted a lot, sort 
of like this.” 

The old man turned and squinted 
with one eye. His features grew 
lewd. The open eye glinted oddly, 
as if with a smile. Jack had the un- 
canny sensation that he was sitting 
beside Walk-on-air. 

“He called her Henrys Oneish in 
the customary way,” the old man 
resumed. “He knew she would 
never be any man’s Twodie. She 
was a President’s daughter, after 
all. But that wasn’t good enough for 
the Woman of the North. After 
one-eyed Henry died, she changed 
her name in a ceremony in Phoenix 
Square, right in front of the Presi- 
dential Pod. She even sent out run- 
ners to advertise the fact. They 
explained what her name meant. 
She didn’t want anyone to miss the 
meaning. At first the people smiled 

45 



at this. They figured she would 
marry the man the Phoenix Con- 
gress selected as president, that be- 
ing the natural expectation. But she 
had another notion. 

“The people of Phoenix eat out 
of her hand, you understand. But 
there are those, even some in 
Phoenix, who blame her father for 
her ways. Henry never had a son. 
He spent his nights in a harem of 
those feathery creatures people call 
Dingbats around that part of the 
country. Zeronica was more or less 
an accident, I understand, or else 
his wife had taken a lover. However 
that may have been, once Zeronica 
was up and about, Henry took a 
shine to her and brought her up as 
if she’d been his son. He taught her 
reading and writing and got her an- 
cient books to read. He even sent 
her on a tour of the world, and 
that’s where it happened, years be- 
fore her father died.’’ 

The old man stopped and refuel- 
led the fire again. Its flames drew 
from the darkness the shape of 
pines bunched closely together. 

“Somewhere far in the north- 
east, up where the ice starts,” he 
went on, “a band of bandits cap- 
tured Zeronica during that tour. 
Henry had sent her with an escort, 
of course, a hundred men, I think. 
But Zeronica had quarelled with the 
captain of her guard, and one morn- 
ing, without his knowledge, she 
rode off early with just her tutor to 
keep her company. That’s when she 
met Alans Shepherd, the man who 
helped her later. 

“The story has it that this 
Shepherd — by reputation a violent 
man, famous for harrassing the 
caravan route that snakes along at 

46 


ice-edge — well, he killed the tutor 
and dragged Zeronica off to his 
tent. She bounced limply on the 
rump of his horse, unconscious in 
her furs, knocked on the head with 
a club. Shepherd yelled and 
screamed with joy, savage that he 
is. But once he got her inside the 
tent and swabbed her back to wak- 
ing, she got the upper hand in a 
hurry. The story has it that she 
stopped him with a look in her eye. 
That’s the kind she is. And before 
you know it, Shepherd was yelling 
through a tent-flap. Slaves came 
running with food and drink. She 
sat on a hassock like a first lady. 
He behaved like she was an equal. 
And the two of them made a deal. 

“What the deal was came out la- 
ter. The story goes that she agreed 
to become his Oneish after it was 
over, after her power was secured. 
She promised him she’d made him 
president. She would be his only 
wife. And, sure enough, people 
say, Alans Shepherd went to her 
chamber in the presidential pod af- 
ter Congress swore her in as 
president-person. And he said to 
her, ‘Zeronica,’ he said, ‘we have 
an agreement. You promised to 
marry me aftpr I put you in power. 
I have put you in power, so be as 
good as your word. ’ 

“I don’t know for a certainty that 
he used those words, Tankers Jack, 
or exactly what happened,” the old 
man said after a pause. “There are 
many stories. Maybe he tried to 
embrace her too, as he had once 
tried to do in his tent — and I guess 
you can imagine him pressing her 
against a credenza or a table, trying 
to find her lips with his. But 
whichever way it was, whether she 

GALAXY 



slapped him, as some say, or 
whether she slipped from his grasp, 
quick as a weasel, or whether they 
never came within a sem of each 
other, all stories agree that she said 
to him, pointing at him: ‘ You put 
me in power, Shepherd? YouT And 
then she started laughing and 
laughed and laughed. Her head 
went way back. And then she dou- 
bled over and slapped her thighs. 
And Shepherd, who thought he was 
a very big man because people 
feared his men, why, he couldn’t 
stand her laughter. He took his hat 
and walked out of there. He swore 
to his closest companions that he’d 
replace the bitch, chase her out of 
Phoenix and take over himself. But 
he never did. He is still there, 
working for her, and Phoenix has 
only one president-person, and 
that’s Zeronica. People say 
Shepherd still loves her, still hopes, 
and can’t do her harm. 

“Well, soon after that, Zeronica 
started making changes, and — ” 

“How did she gain power?” Jack 
interrupted. 

“What? Oh, that. Well, she 
brought Shepherd and his ruffians 
back with her from her world tour. 
Shepherd followed her like a little 
dog, and his pack right behind him. 
She called them her personal body 
guard. One-eyed Henry chuckled at 
it fondly. He let her do anything 
she pleased. Slowly Shepherd built 
U P his forces. He hired the scum of 
Phoenix, people without cult or 
property. By the time Henry died, 
Shepherd’s gang was larger than the 
Phoenix military. But people didn’t 
^now that until the scum came from 
|he cracks in the clay. Members of 
Congress who opposed her election 

plutonium 


learned to fear Shepherd’s raiders. 
One or two pods burned down mys- 
teriously. A couple of members 
died in tavern brcwls. The upshot 
was that they elected Zeronica 
president-person and no questions 
asked.” 

The old man leaned forward, 
groaned a little, and tossed more 
wood on the fire. He shivered a lit- 
tle. His years made him cold. He 
sank back at last, his eyes pensive 
and far away. He was finished for 
the moment. 

“Well?” Jack prompted. He felt 
a great excitement in his bones. 

“Well,” said the old man with a 
sign, “she’s a witch, I tell you. It’s 
those books, I suspect, or the old 
ruins she saw on her travels — God 
knows I’ve seen my share of them; 
never could make much out of such 
rat havens; but her mind was 
charged up with reading. At any 
rate, she called in Congress soon af- 
ter she took over and she proc- 
laimed that here — I mean Phoenix 
now, you understand — that here in 
Phoenix they would establish the 
New Secular Order, That’s what she 
called it. She told them how the old 
world would come back. God had 
decreed that it would happen. That 
came from a book too, I think. Her 
reasoning was that it would happen 
in Phoenix, and nowhere else, be- 
cause there had been a prophecy 
about a bird, and the bird had been 
called Phoenix, and when it burned 
it rose up again from the ashes. 

‘ ‘On the feast of Superstar, which 
some cults celebrate in the month of 
December — two years ago, it 
was — Zeronica made a declaration 
freeing all the mutants in Phoenix 
and on the surrounding lands, say- 

47 



ing that slavery was evil and didn’t 
fit the New Secular Order. She said 
she saw no difference between mu- 
tants and men. See what I mean? 
Well, Congress voted its support for 
her and Shepherd put down the re- 
bellion on the farms. 

“Then, last year — the girl’s quite 
handy with proclamations, Tankers 
Jack,” the old man said, shaking 
his head, “she announced that wom- 
en were equal to men — ” 

‘‘She said that!” cried Tankers 
Jack. 

“She did,” nodded the monk. 

“And she got away with it?” 

“She did,” said the monk again. 
“I don’t rightly know why, either. 
But, as I said, she’s a witch and 
people eat out of her hand. They 
believe her. I’ve heard a story or 
two to the effect that she has as- 
sembled all sorts of ancient mys- 
teries and has a priesthood of her 
own, trying to make them work. 
She has no decency, you see, and 
scorns the customs. Among those 
things, or so I am told, she has a 
mystery that makes pictures on the 
wall. You can see people walking 
and hear them talk as if they were 
real. And with this magic she bam- 
boozles the Congress to do things 
her way. The New Secular Order!” 
the old man spat. “God forbid such 
heresy. 

‘‘And so, Tankers Jack,” he 
concluded, ‘‘I think the abbot is 
right when he suspects her. It 
wouldn’t surprise the Hierarchy to 
learn that Alans Shepherd led the 
thieves that killed our brothers. But 
don’t say a word to these simple 
yokels,” he said, gesturing all 
about. “They don’t need to know 
what we know. But you’ll go a long 

48 


ways in the order, Tankers Jack 
You need to hear the truth. But no\ 
wrap up and go to sleep. The call 
is deepening.” 

The old man pulled a blanke 
about himself. He lay down, his bad 
to the fire. His eyes closed and he 
seemed to go to sleep. 

Jack sat erect for a long time. He 
stared into the smallish flame lick 
ing the last piece of wood. Ash lay 
on the log like reptile scale; the 
flame burned blue above the glow 
of embers; 

He saw Walk-on-air’s fine hanc 
in all this — the meeting with Goos 
ers Texas, the story of Zeronica. He 
recognized her touch across the ages 
and knew her though he’d never 
seen her current form. Fateful, al 
this. He had to hurry away into the 
growing night chill from this spot of 
fading warmth. His karmic journey 
was not quite over. She too, like 
he, attracted Plutnoium. And so did 
Alans Shepherd, the unknown third 
in this star-crossed party, whose 
pathetic quest for Zeronica’ s love 
seemed oddly reminiscent of some- 
thing lost in Long Ago. A missile 
had found her. Jack had to find it. 
He owed as much to the twentieth 
century. 

VIII 

The missile glowed very high up, 
suspended nose down in the centei 
of a wooden tower. The tower stood 
in Phoenix Square. The Squar< 
stood in the center of Phoenix . Ant 
Phoenix was the center of the 
world. Bright stones spelling an in- 
scription said so. 

Jack stood at the foot of the tow; 
er and peered up into the height, 

GALAXY^ 



Darkness gathered as the sun set, 
but its filtered rays made the mis- 
sile’s hull glow red. It might have 
been a brass bell hung in a spire. 

He wondered if the missile could 
pick up information through visual 
sensors implanted in its hull, and 
what the brain might think of 
Phoenix which, from his height, 
must be like an open book spread 
out for all to read. 

Jack, for one, couldn’t read this 
age. The memories of other lives in- 
terfered with his understanding. The 
new America constantly amazed 
him. The streets of Phoenix, for 
example, wound themselves around 
and around a center like lines on a 
conch shell, narrow and crowded. 
The simplicity of the constructions 
didn’t explain the pattern. All the 
houses had a fundamental similari- 
ty, as if the primitive builders were 
informed by an invisible Spirit and 
labored like ants to construct Its 
hidden forms. All over America, in 
endless variations, he had observed 
the same phenomenon, the birth of 
a new form world, still tentative, 
groping, and unsure of itself, but 
recognizably the same. 

He shook his head and felt regret 
that he hadn’t studied history in any 
of his lives. With more information, 
he might understand why this 
America reminded him of hives. 
Oval shapes dominated the architec- 
ture. The buildings seemed to hang 
between upright columns, giant 
pods, modified only at the base 
where the requirements of physics 
overcame the cultural tendency. In- 
side the houses — they reached sev- 
eral storeys into the vertical — 
spiralling stairs led from level to 
level and corridors criss-crossed 


each level in that random pattern 
which everyone born into this cen- 
tury (without memories of other 
times) found perfectly sensible. 

Community, communality, he 
thought, and it occurred to him that 
mankind might be planning a new 
adaptation of which the architecture 
was but an outward sign: a style 
and a feeling which might prevent, 
once Science awoke again, the crea- 
tion of such monstrosities as that 
thing above, a brass bell that had no 
charity. As yet Jack saw no other 
sign of such a desirable adaptation, 
but the buildings, cities, and many 
forms of family organization pre- 
dicted it as through a glass, darkly. 

He waited a while longer and let 
the darkness settle in. When it 
came, it was nearly total. Without 
electricity, these new cities died 
with sunset. Glass was a rarity, the 
climate unreasonably cold, and 
people shut their windows tight with 
heavy wooden shutters insulated 
with bits of cloth at the cracks. 
Only a few people moved about in 
the light of torches. 

At last, feeling that it was safe 
enough, Jack moved toward the 
tower — it was little more than a 
framework, really, and he slipped 
between its heavy supports seeking 
a ladder. He found it soon, a rough, 
makeshift affair built for workmen. 
He took a breath and began the long 
ascent. 

Standing on a narrow platform 
and surprised somewhat that wind 
gusted up here while below it had 
been calm, Jack approached the 
missile. It hung in a network of 
leather straps. He rapped his knuck- 
les against the metal of its hull. The 
act evoked a dull sound. 


PLUTONIUM 


49 



Jack wondered if he would 
achieve what he planned. He hoped 
he would. Otherwise his life might 
be snuffed out, along with hers, and 
their reunion might have to wait 
another growing up. 

“Hi there,” Jack said. 

“What? Who’s there?” 

The voice sounded sleepy, but 
Jack knew this to be illusion. 
Neuro-fibers linked the brain to a 
computer. The computer spliced to- 
gether phrases from a tape-bank — 
pre-recorded phrases spoken by a 
pleasant baritone, an actor’s rich 
warble. 

“John Clark, at your service,” 
Jack said. In the presence of this 
thing, his old American name came 
more naturally than ‘Tankers Jack.’ 
“I came to ask after your health. 
Are you operational? Or did you get 
damaged in the war? Your hull 
seems battered a good deal. Your 
rocket thrusters are gone. I’m sur- 
prised you’re still alive.” 

The missile gleamed in silence, 
in a state of shock. Then the pleas- 
ant baritone spoke quickly. The 
voice had no emotional toning, but 
Jack sensed nevertheless a wild ex- 
citement beneath the words. 

‘.‘Jesus Christ,” the baritone said. 
The voice trembled from the center 
of the needle, a darkish reticulation 
in the metal. “Don’t tell me you 
understand me? John Clark, did you 
say? What is this? What year is 
this? Oh, never mind. I am hal- 
lucinating. Stop your tricks, Frank- 
ie. Just stop it; don’t torture me. 
Hello? Are you still there? Is any- 
body out there?’ ’ 

“I’m here,” Jack said. “John 
Clark, recently with the AEC.” 
“AEC? Oh, Jesus! Frankie, for 

50 


God’s sake, why don’t you just let 
me sleep in peace. These dreams!” 
“I take it that your visual sensors 
are out of order?” 

“Visual sensors! Visual sensors, 
the guy says. I’ll be damned. 
You’ve just got to believe! You bet- 
ter believe they’re out of order. I’m 
as blind as a bat. Blind, impotent, 
immobile, and crazy. That’s me. 
Frank J. Harmon, at your service. 
CR 17459110.” 

“What doeg ‘CR’ stand for?” 
“You don’t know? Hell’s bells, 
the guy might be for real. Not an il- 
lusion. ‘Conscious Rocket,’ John 
Clark. That’s your name, isn’t it? 
Clark?” 

“John Clark, Mr. Harmon.” 
“Mister. He knows how to say 
mister. Glory be!” 

“I am a skilled nuclear engineer, 
Mr. Harmon, lately with the AEC, 
like I said. Now retired. I thought I 
might help you, if I can help you. 
The natives around here tell me that 
you’re unhappy.” 

The missile was silent again. A 
faint new moon had risen over the 
horizon. It was just a blur of light 
in the perpetual murk of the atmos- 
phere but bright enough to ease 
forth a shadowy outline of the city 
below. 

The missile suddenly burst out: 
“Unhappy, did you say? I’ll give 
you unhappy, Mr. Clark. How 
would you like to live the life I’ve 
lived. Quadruple amputee? Get it? 
If you’re with the AEC, you’ll re- 
member that war. We called it the 
Palestine Insertion Operation. A 
great big dong slipped right into Is- 
rael’s see you, auntie. You get the 
picture. It got me then. Observers, 
we were called. But I am boring 


GALAXY 



you! Tell me you’re still there, John 
Clark.” 

‘‘I’m here. I read you loud and 
clear, Frankie.” 

“Say it again. 

“Say what again?” 

“Say ‘Frankie’ again.” 

“Sure, Frankie. Any time.” 
“Man, that feels good. I get a 
real high, hearing that word. Jesus 
Christ!” 

“You were telling me your story, 
Frankie.” 

“Johnny, bless you, how I 
groove on you. My story? What a 
trip. Real fun, being a basket case. 
Hester, my wife. She met me at the 
airport when they brought us back, 
and she had a look in her eyes, let 
me tell you. You don’t know that 
look, how could you? I don’t know 
the look myself, any more. I’ve 
been in this darkness all this time. 
What do I know about seeing any 
more. I just see this darkness, and I 
hear all' sorts of things. I am a real 
good listener now. Never was a lis- 
tener before. But I listened real hard 
to Hester. Night and day. I heard 
her on the telephone whispering to 
the Veterans Administration by the 
hour. And her whispering to little 
tom — Tom’s my son, you see — 
telling him Daddy’s very, very sick. 
And then they had this hush-hush 
program to find astronauts. Physical 
impairments were said to be no im- 
pediment, in fact preferred. Am I 
losing you, Johnny? Are you still 
there? I don’t know how to tell a 
story any more.” 

“I am with you, Frankie. They 
wanted you to be an astronaut. ’ ’ 
‘‘Yes, sir. Useful again. Learn 
new skills. Earn a lot of money for 
Hester. Little Tommy could wear a 

plutonium 


button in school: My Daddy is an 
Astronaut. Red white and blue. Say 
it again, Mr. Clark,” 

“Frankie,” Jack said. 

“Thanks, Thanks a lot. I needed 
that. So I signed an agreement. 
Hester said it was all right. I had 
trouble reading. Even then, some- 
thing with my eyes. They promised 
to fix that, in astronaut school. I 
held the ballpoint between my teeth. 
They had a guy from NASA there. 
He was a notary. He signed a cer- 
tificate to prove that my scrawl was 
really mine. It looked like some 
kid’s doodle. Didn’t look like Frank 
J. Harmon at all. Never would have 
made it as a painter. Making water- 
colors for Christmas cards. You 
know what that is? Christmas 
cards? Johnny!” 

“I am present and accounted for, 
Frankie. Christinas cards were sent 
at Christmas to all those dear and 
near. Okay? We cared enough to 
send the very best.” 

“Bless you, Johnny. Hallmark 
Cards. Oh, bless you, bless you, 
bless you. Can you help me? Help 
me, Johnny. I want to see again.” 
“I’ll do my best, Frank, old bud- 
dy. But tell me what happened? Did 
they kill you and put you in a 
machine?” 

“ ‘Death takes place when cere- 
bral functions cease,’ ” Frankie 
quoted. “They didn’t kill me. No 
sirree. I signed that authorization, 
didn’t I? It said that I agreed to ac- 
cept prosthetic devices that would 
restore my useful functioning. 
Didn’t I? You tell me. I did. It 
looked like a kid’s doodle, but it 
was done by yours truly, a ballpoint 
between the teeth, eyes crossed, 
almost, to try to see the paper. The 

51 



small print was blurred. Get the pic- 
ture, Johnny? Johnny?” 

“Frankie.” 

“You’re for real, aren’t you?” 
“I’m for real,” Jack said. 

“Mind you, Johnny, I didn’t 
kick. (Not that I had anything to 
kick with.) First off they put these 
probes into my brain, and next 
thing you know, I was having sex. 
Wild, unbelievable. Better than ever 
with Hester or anyone else. Wow! 
They just tickled something in the 
brain, and there I was, flipping out. 
Kama Sutra, baby. Real unbelieva- 
ble, like. They did it when we were 
cooperative, and you’ve never seen 
a bunch of studs cooperate like we 
did. It went on and on, even after 
we were implanted in the ships. I 
remember standing there, on my 
launching platform, eyes out over 
the Pacific, this giant thing all 
around me, and my brain feeling 
the hydraulic fluids gush and swish 
about, and I’d be having these or- 
gasms up there, one after the other, 
Jesus Christ, Johnny! Johnny?” 
“Frankie, would it help if I put 
my hand on your hull? Can you feel 
it?” 

“No. All gone. Sensory’s gone, 
visual’s gone, mobile is gone, sex 
is gone. There’s nothing but these 
thoughts and dreams and hallucina- 
tions. Say, how long was I out 
there, in the swamp?” 

“Were you in a swamp?” 

‘‘You didn’t know that? In a 
swamp. The sunlight barely reached 
down. I almost died. Even now, it’s 
weaker than it used to be. Or else 
my memory is failing. I got lost, 
coming back, after the great Tele- 
pathic Conference we held, we and 
the Chinese missiles, above the 


GALAXY 



Pacific. We could talk to each other 
without the voice tapes. No lan- 
guage barrier, either. They sent me 
back, headed for Houston. Some- 
thing went wrong on the way. My 
eyes, I think. Never any good to 
start with. Hell of a thing. Here I’d 
been an observer, you know, watch- 
ing that famous insertion. And next 
thing you know, some little wire 
must have burned up. Look rna. No 
arms, no legs, no eyes. And no sex, 
either. They controlled that from 
someplace central. Dole you out an 
orgasm every now and then. Obedi- 
ence earned it for you. Good boys 
get to do whoopee. But something 
got Central early in the war. Get the 
picture? Johnny?” 

‘‘Here I am,” Jack said and 
pounded on the hull. ‘‘You feel 
that?” 

“Faintly, old friend. I hear the 
vibrations. I can’t feel anything on 
the outside. Feeling’s all gone.” 
“What about inside,” Jack 
asked. “Your explosive charge — is 
that in good shape? Could 
you . still explode?” 

“Don’t be shy,” Frankie said. “I 
know I’m a bomb. We found that 
out after a while. Telepathy,*' you 
know. We could feel our buddies 
dying. Odd sensation, filled with 
sex desire. You believe in reincar- 
nation?” 

“Sometimes, Frankie.” 

“Well, I do,” the missile said. 
“I’ve been trying to get myself kil- 
led. Now I’m not so sure. A guy 
has to have a friend. Are you there, 
friend?” 

“I’m here, right next to you,” 
Jack soothed. “I asked about your 
insides. ’ ’ 

“You sure did, Johnny, and I 

plutonium 


don’t mind telling you. I think it’s 
still all there. I check every now 
and then. Guy in my condition, he’s 
got to know about his death. You 
know what I mean? That’s all I’ve 
got going for me. I need a good 
impact on the nose of this thing. Set 
off the electrical impulse to start the 
fusion, drive the mass together. 
Critical mass. Hey, man. The last 
big orgasm.” 

“Did you talk these people into 
dropping you?” 

“Did I? I tried. But I’m blind as 
a bat. They thought I was God, and 
I sort of went along. Told them to 
drop me and I’d come out. Savage 
types, would you say? Like those 
Palestinians I helped insert. But 
don’t tell the press. You’re not 
press, are you?” 

“No. I’m just a retired guy. 
AEC, like I said.” 

“Good. Don’t tell them we 
helped with the fighting. Not sup- 
posed to do that. Observers just ob- 
serve. Get it?” 

“I get it.” 

“Oil shortage still critical? Is 
there still a shortage?” 

“Not that I can tell,” Jack said. 
He glanced about involuntarily. 
Phoenix lay there, a dark crowding 
of oddly arranged pods. The streets 
wound around and around in a 
spiralling coil toward the nub of the 
city, lines on a conch shell, and this 
square the center of the world. 

“You don’t really want to die,” 
Jack said. 

“I don’t? Maybe I don’t. But it 
sure is boring in here. You can’t be- 
lieve what it was like, in the 
swamp. It gurgled the whole time. I 
must have been down there more 
than a year.” 

53 



“Would you believe a century?” 

“What?!” 

“Two and a half centuries?” 

“Jesus. But . but then how 
come you know the things you 
know? Is there still an AEC? All 
these savages?” 

“Don’t fret about that,” Jack 
said. “Can you open your hull? I’d 
like to look inside you, look at your 
charge. Can you give me access?” 

Frankie hesitated. The wind was 
gusting. 

“You’re my friend, aren’t you?” 

“I’m your friend, Frankie. Here’s 
what I’ll do for you. I’ll fix your 
eyes again — if they can be fixed. 
And I’ll keep you company. Who 
knows, I might even find a way to 
give you sex again. But you’ve got 
to help me. You’re hanging in a 
tower in the middle of a city. If 
they drop you, you’ll get what you 
want. You’ll die and go to paradise. 
But so will all the people around 
here — and for miles around. You 
don’t want that kind of orgasm, do 
you?” 

“Wait a minute!” Frankie said. 
The baritone had no emotional to- 
ning, but Jack sensed challenge in 
the words. 

“Just a little minute, friend. Do 
you think I care? You think I give a 
damn? Haven’t I done my share? 
Who are these people, anyway? I 
can’t see a soul. What gives you the 
right to tell me how to die. I get it. 
You’re trying to trick me. AEC, did 
you say? Well, let me tell you 
something, buddy. You guys were 
always jealous of us NASA types. 
No soap, old friend. Are you there? 
Johnny?” 

Jack stood on the platform and 
didn’t say a word. 

54 


“Johnny? For crying out loud, 
say somthing.” 

Jack said nothing. 

“Johnny, please. No offense. 
Look. I’m opening the panel for 
you. See, I’m your friend. I trust 
you. Say something.” 

“I’m watching, Frankie,” Jack 
said. He observed a straight crack 
in the silvery hull. It grew larger as 
a piece of the metal slid smoothly 
away to the inside. He stepped 
closer and Jooked in. “It’s too dark 
to see inside,” he said. 

“I’ll make you a light.” A glow 
illuminated masses of componentry. 

“Explain what I am looking at,” 
Jack said. 

“The charge is that flat octagon 
on the right,” Frankie explained. 
“Or maybe, from your perspective, 
it’s on the left. I don’t know my 
spatial arrangements. The gyro is 
shot. See it? Johnny?” 

“I see it, Frank.” 

“All right, buddy. Now, on the 
left, or maybe it’s on the right — ” 
“Frankie, that tiny little thing? 
That’s the charge?” 

“Charge? Did I say charge? I 
meant the trigger. It’s a fusion trig- 
ger. It’s small, all right. Progress, 
you know. Just a bunch of mirrors 
and a vacuum. Stop that. It feels 
like a tickle.” 

“It’s welded in there,” Jack said. 
“How can I get it out.” 

“It just looks like a weld, old 
friend. Electrostatic adhesion. I can 
snap it loose for you — if I want 
to.” 

“Snap it, then.” 

“I’ll snap it when I know I can 
trust you. Can I trust you, Johnny? 
Johnny? Johnny! . Sure, I can 
trust you, there, see? I snapped it 


GALAXY 



loose for you. Now you’ve got it, 
Johnny. You’ve got my manhood. I 
gave you everything I’ve got. My 
death is all I’ve got to give. Get it? 
johnny, I love you, see? I love you. 
Hey, Johnny!” 

“I’m here, Frank. I’m looking at 
this thing. What would happen if 
they dropped you now? Any chance 
for a big bang?” 

“No way,” Frankie said. “Like I 
told you. I gave you my manhood. 
Without that trigger, no critical 
mass. Need that fusion to melt the 
walls to suck the hot stuff into the 
center by the inertial. Figured that 
out, in the swamp. All dispersed 
now, between my parts, the stuff. 
Iridium walls. Safe as anything. 
Johnny?” 

‘‘I’m here, Frankie. I’m with 
you. Now listen. It’s night time 
right now, and I need light to work 
on you. You go to sleep now, and 
tomorrow we’ll talk again. I'll work 
on your eyes, first thing. Okay?” 

“Don’t leave me,” said the mel- 
low baritone, without emotional to- 
ning. But underneath Jack sensed a 
growing anguish. 

EX 

Alans shepherd strode down the 
corridor in the wake of the soldier 
who had come to get him. Anger 
boiled inside his head and guts. The 
messenger had interrupted his din- 
ner preparations. Shepherd seldom 
made such preparations, but this 
time was unique. 

Zeronica had sent him an invita- 
tion to attend the celebration ban- 
quet. A written invitation. His sec- 
retary, a Dingbat named Birdie, had 
read it out to him in her ancient 

PLUTONIUM 


cackle. Then Birdie had smiled sly- 
ly. 

But Shepherd had fewer hopes 
than the feathery fern. Zeronica 
couldn’t be trusted. Nevertheless, 
the invitation kindled hopes he had 
seen turn to ash. But Godbod only 
knew! Perhaps she had changed her 
mind and would fulfill him, now, at 
last. The matter with the needle had 
worked out after all. And the other 
day, looking up at the tower his 
men had built in record time, 
Zeronica had praised his skill in 
words of startling kindness. Tomor- 
row the world would see 
‘epiphany.’ Birdie had told him 
what the word meant: God’s ap- 
pearance among men. The voice in- 
side the needle would show itself in 
fire and lightning, thunder and 
smoke. Phoenix would become a 
shrine, the magnet of a grand, 
yearly pilgrimage. 

Now it was moments before the 
bell would call the banquet. The in- 
terruption came at a terrible time. A 
scribe, the soldier had said. What 
sort of scribe could convince the 
guard to violate orders. No busi- 
ness. Not tonight. Some scribe. 
Terribly persuasive fellow, Well, he 
would be persuading rats tonight. In 
the dungeon. Insolent creature. 

Moments later Shepherd sat down 
behind a table and they showed the 
scribe in, closed the door. He was 
dark, slender, and had long, sensi- 
tive fingers. Moist eyes looked at 
Shepherd from beneath the shadow 
of a black hat’s rim. A golden ear- 
ring dangled from his ear and re- 
flected the shine of torches stuck 
into wrought iron holders in the 
wall. 

Shepherd felt a rippling shudder 

55 



pass down his back, an unpleasant 
sensation of tingling cold. The eyes 
across the table infused him with 
fear; so did the hint of a smile 
around those sensuous lips. His own 
steady face stiffened. He laid his 
hands on the table and stared at the 
scribe. 

“What can I do for you,” he 
said, using words much milder that 
he had intended. 

The scribe sat down without an 
invitation. 

“I am told I must get your per- 
mission to see your mistress, the 
president-person.” 

“That may be,” Shepherd re- 
sponded. “// you get to see her. 
Which isn’t sure at all.” 

“I expect to see her. Immediate- 
ly,” the scribe said, smiling. 

“What makes you think that?” 
Shepherd challenged. So doing, he 
felt uncertainty in his stomach. The 
scribe sent out vibrations. They 
cramped Shepherd’s innards. 

“I have information of the 
greatest urgency.” 

“Then tell me" 

“I’ll tell the president-person and 
no one else.” 

“In that case you might die with 
your news,” Shepherd said coolly. 
He hoped the scribe had heard the 
threat. 

“I don’t think so,” the scribe 
said. “Does the name Theodore 
Aspic mean anything to you?” 

Shepherd shook his head. He felt 
the chill again. It ran down his 
back. Someone had walked across 
his grave, or some such nonsense. 

“Did you know that the ritual 
machinery installed in the upper 
portion of Plutonium has been de- 
stroyed?” 

56 


“What ritual machinery?” 
Shepherd asked. He wondered what 
in the world the man wanted and 
why he felt so nauseous. Could this 
scribe be a magician? “Try to make 
sense, man. I’m busy. I can’t fool 
around with you all night.” He 
cocked his head, listening for the 
bell. 

“Then take me to your mistress,” 
said the scribe. 

“So far you haven’t given me a 
good enough reason.” 

“Does the name John Clark ring 
a bell?” 

Shepherd shuddered. The man 
across the table had an uncanny look. 
He seemed familiar in some way. 
Was he someone Shepherd had met 
in his bandit days? Was he someone 
Shepherd had killed! The thought 
gave him another cold shiver. He 
didn’t believe in ghosts. No way. 

“I have vital information about 
the brain-missile,” the scribe said. 

“The what!" 

“The bomb.” 

“What bomb?” 

“The bomb you’ve got hanging 
in the tower. The talking bomb.” 

“Godbod?” 

“Godbod, if you like.” 

The scribe reached into a satchel 
he carried at his side. He took from 
it an odd-looking something. An 
Old Order mystery. He laid it on 
the table. It was flat and had eight 
points. Reddish eyes seemed to be 
arranged on its surface. 

“What is that?” 

“It’s a fusion trigger. You should 
know. You were a physicist once.” 

Shepherd stared at the scribe. The 
man appeared to be sane, but his 
words were troubled and incom- 
prehensible. 


GALAXY 



“I took it out of . , Godbod to- 
night. I went up there and had a 
chat with it.” 

“You’re insane,’’ Shepherd 
cried. “FRANKLIN!” he yelled. A 
soldier looked in through the door. 
“Take this character and lock him 

t » 

up. 

“Just a minute,” the scribe said 
calmly. He showed no fear or ex- 
citement. “Your mistress will want 
to know why Godbod gave me this 
precious part of himself. Don’t you 
think? What if nothing happens to- 
morrow when your people cut the 
straps and the thing falls down. 
Wouldn’t you want to know? How 
will you explain that?” 

“Get out of here, Franklin,” 
Shepherd shouted at the soldier. 
Darkness surrounded him. He didn’t 
know what he was doing. The door 
closed. 

“Look,” he said, pointing a 
finger at the scribe. “If this is a 
trick, I’ll personally see to it 
that. ...” His finger wobbled 
threateningly. 

“No trick,” the scribe said. 

Shepherd stared at him. In the si- 
lence between them, nausea groped 
toward his stomach. 

“Five minutes,” he said. 
"You’ll have five minutes with her. 
No more. And you better make 
sense.” 

He rose. Hollowly, through the 
intricately arranged walls of the 
Presidential pod, he heard the chime 
calling the banquet. 

“Five minutes,” he repeated, and 
he pointed to a sand-clock on the 
corner of the desk. 

He watched while the scribe put 
avv ay the mystery. Then he left the 
r oom. The scribe followed him. 

plutonium 


Shepherd looked over his shoulder. 
“And what do they call you?” 
“Tankers Jack,” the scribe said. 
Shepherd turned the name this 
way and that. It had no echoes, 
meant nothing at all, had no effect. 
He had never heard of a Tankers 
Jack, nor of a Tanker. The man was 
not some enemy’s son, no matter 
how familiar he looked. But he was 
persuasive, dammit. And oddly 
frightening. His eyes ruled 
Shepherd’s, much as Zeronica’s 
did. Shepherd, though aware of 
this, wouldn’t let the knowledge 
surface. 

The presidential pod was a 
multi-structure. They had to pass 
from the eastern to the central por- 
tion of it by way of a covered 
bridge. In its middle Tankers Jack 
suddenly stopped, his hand on 
Shepherd’s sleeve. His right hand de- 
scribed the panorama of rooftops 
with a wave. 

“Fancy meeting like this again,” 
he said. “In such a setting.” 

“I’ve never laid eyes on you be- 
fore,” Shepherd said with fright. 
He jerked his arm out of the 
scribe’s hand. Phoenix lay before 
them. The tower loomed im- 
mediately up ahead, a wooden 
structure so skillfully erected and in 
such record time. Shepherd glanced 
up and saw Godbod’ s dull shimmer 
up there, half hidden by sections of 
timber. The moon, having risen 
high, enhanced its silvery glow. 

“Your memory fails you, Alans 
Shepherd,” the scribe said. “But 
never mind that. I wonder if your 
mistress will remember me.” 
Shepherd shuddered. He walked 
on, trying" to shake off the eerie 
feeling. Deep down he experienced 

57 



a tiny despair, a dark kind of know- 
ing. It came into his being through 
chinks in the armor of his moral 
darkness. He stood before some 
kind of test, but didn’t know it. To 
him it was simply a wrench of 
nausea. 

They entered the banqueting 
chamber some moments later. The 
guests had not yet settled down. 
Zeronica throned in a sitting-basket 
hung from the ceiling by a chain. 
Senators and congressmen stood 
about her drinking beer from mugs. 
Her posture was regal. Her hands 
rested on the basket’s arms, her 
gaze was steady. One of her legs 
was pulled up on the silken cush- 
ion. 

Shepherd approached over the 
burned tile floor. His spurs rang 
like bells. Suddenly the scribe broke 
from his side and, with quickened 
strides, went ahead. Shepherd saw 
him bow before Zeronica. He did so 
in a strange way. His hat swept the 
floor in an exaggerated gesture. One 
of his legs was pulled back, the 
other stuck forward. 

“Zeronica,” the scribe said. His 
voice was melodious and rang 
through the hall. “I have sought 
you for centuries, my lady. It is a 
pleasure to see you so well — and so 
beautiful.” 

Congressmen and senators, 
ladies-in-wait, and even the beeman 
servants preparing the tables to the 
right, the small one and the large 
one, looked up and stared with sur- 
prise at this common, shabby fig- 
ure, dressed like a vagabond. 

Shepherd made haste to reach 
Zeronica’ s side. 

“Mistress,” he began, “I 
apologize for this ...” 


She silenced him with a wave off 
her hand. Her eyes were fixed on 
the dark face of the scribe. Fear 
stabbed Shepherd as he watched 
her. Something in her features had 
softened, perhaps in response to the 
scribe’s small smile. 

“Step closer,” she said to the 
man. “I take it you’re not from 
these parts. Did I meet you on my 
tour?” 

“You met me on your tour,” the 
scribe affirmed. “Don’t I look 
familiar?’ ’ 

Zeronica hesitated, a finger in 
front of her lips. “Y-yes,” she 
said. “Something about you does 
seem . , . But, frankly, I don’t re- 
call our meeting.” 

“That may be so,” the scribe 
came back. He tossed his head and 
made the earring glimmer. Then he 
looked down. “I am an inconse- 
quential scribe, my lady. If I were 
to suggest to you that we were close 
friends once, it would be presump- 
tion on my part, however true it 
may be.” He looked up. “I sought 
you out, lady, drawn by my 
memories of you — and also because 
I heard of your interest in Old Or- 
der mysteries. Over the years, I 
have become a master — ” 

“Mistress,” shepherd broke in 
harshly, “this scribe came to me 
and demanded — ’ ’ 

“Shush,” Zeronica said, her eyes; 
on the scribe, “A master of the 
mysteries? she asked. 

“If I may be so bold,” the scribe 
said. 

“In that case,” Zeronica said, 
“perhaps you would care to take 
dinner with me?” 

“Your suggestion is my 
wish,” the scribe said, bowi

★ * ★ 

Darkness closed in over Shepherd 
as dinner advanced. Until this day 
he had hoped, however small the 
hope, that Zeronica would someday 
be his. She had shown little interest 
in him. But she had scorned other 
men as well — which had reassured 
him. But what he saw tonight made 
his heart heavy. Waves camp to- 
gether over his head. 

Upon his entrance into the room, 
Shepherd had noticed the small ta- 
ble, some distance from the large 
one, with two couches positioned 
side-by-side along its low, triangu- 
lar surface. Despite the scribe’s dis- 
turbing presence, he had spied that 
table, off to the side, and a thrill 
had passed through his bowels, de- 
spite the nausea. He had divined, in 
a flash, that she had meant to dine 
with him. Alone. With him, with 
Alans Shepherd, the guest of honor 
at this banquet celebrating 
epiphany. He had brought the God- 
bod. He deserved her special favor. 

But now, cruelly, she lay on one 
couch and he lay on the other. He, 
the scribe. The creature called Tan- 
kers Jack. As for Shepherd — 
whistling beemen had brought an 
extra couch for him. They had 
placed it at the big table. Where the 
senators and congressman reclined 
between chattering ladies-in-wait. 

Zeronica behaved oddly, and the 
talk at Shepherd’s table turned 
around that subject. The high-placed 
guests threw Shepherd furtive 
glances as they gossiped. They 
knew the couch had been meant for 
him. Now they saw Zeronica giggle 
lr > an uncontrolled way. Then again 

Plutonium 


her eyes were fixed on the scribe’s 
dark features as he spoke. Only his 
golden ring seemed to move. He 
mesmerized her. She forgot to eat. 
But then, thinking he had bound her 
long enough, the scribe made lively 
gestures and jokes. Then she 
laughed again and reached for mor- 
sels of food on her plate. The se- 
quence repeated and went on and on. 

As hours passed, the company 
grew restless. Demons Howard fell 
asleep on his couch, a fat senator. 
A lady-in-wait shook him from time 
to time to stop his raspy snores. 
Others drank gloomily and won- 
dered when she might announce the 
end. Her banquet speech had not 
been delivered. She seemed to have 
forgotten the occasion. Instead her 
shiny blondness moved closer and 
closer to that dark head adorned by 
moist eyes and sensuous lips. One 
or two torches went out and smoked 
black against the wall. Only the 
s chief beeman stayed around. He sat 
on a chair inside the door that led to 
the kitchen. His bony legs were vis- 
ible; the rest of him leaned back, 
out of sight. He probably dozed. 

Shepherd couldn’t stand another 
minute of it. He rose abruptly. He 
left without the customary farewells 
to the hostess. His spurs rang an- 
grily on tile. He wheeled about at 
the door, but Zeronica hadn’t even 
turned her head. 

He meant to go back to his quar- 
ters. His few belongings would be 
quickly packed. He would call the 
men whom he controlled, his origi- 
nal band, and before dawn’s rust 
rose above the horizon, he would 
leave Phoenix, shaking dust from 
his boots. But halfway down the 
corridor that led to the bridge that 

59 



led to east pod where his own quar- 
ters lay, Shepherd stopped and 
turned around. Curiosity ate him 
like acid. His eyes hungered to see 
the end. A gorgeous fury assailed 
him. On the way back, without 
thinking, he took a curved sword 
from a wall rack and slipped it in- 
side his tunic. Then, stealthily, he 
inserted himself into a children’s 
corridor. 

By the time he found a spot 
where the wall, broken by wooden 
trellis work, gave him a view of the 
banquet hall, most of the guests had 
taken leave. They had followed 
Shepherd’s example. Only Dentons 
Howard snored loudly, without in- 
hibitions, on the couch. The chief 
of the beemen cleared the table. 
Then he also took his leave. 

Shepherd watched, his breath a 
hot reflection from the trellis. They 
rose at last and walked away, hand 
in hand. Shepherd followed them, 
using children’s corridors. His 
boots, left behind, couldn’t reveal 
his movements. His naked feet stir- 
red the dust of these unused path- 
ways. 

He lay on his stomach one floor 
above, eyes before another trellis. 
He tried to pierce the darkness. But 
he could see nothing below. Only 
his ears told him that they made 
love beneath him on the presidential 
bed. He began to sob without 
sound. 

Later he listened to silence, then 
to whisperings. The curved blade 
pressed against his body beneath the 
tunic, but he didn’t have the heart 
to pull it out, to plunge into the 
dark room where they breathed, to 
avenge Zeronica’s treachery once 
and for all. Something paralyzed his 

60 


hands and will. A little gap in hid 
moral darkness allowed light tdl 
shine through. The light came from] 
her and also, oddly, from him.| 
When, after a while, they beganj 
again and he heard her soft moaning! 
like a fist in his gut, Shepherd rose 
and retraced his steps, his desola- 
tion hardening to ice. Yes, ice. Go 
home, bandit. Go home. His sobs 
subsided and his eyes dried out. He 
put on his boots again and went 
away across the bridge. His feet 
tinkled like bells. 

He decided that he couldn’t harm 
her. But neither would he let her 
keep the gift that he had brought 
her, the ultimate gift, the last thing 
that she had said she needed to put 
Phoenix in the center of the world. 

Grim of face, he roused his men 
and whispered orders. They sat up 
in their beds and rubbed their eyes. 
Then, groggily, they got up and 
groped for clothing. 

★ ★ * 

Jack woke suddenly. He had been 
dozing. Zeronica’s arm lay across 
his chest, and her shallow breath 
moved against his shoulder. He fell 
anguish, although he didn’t know 
its source. It seemed that a voice 
had exploded in his head. A 
baritone had called for Johnny. 
Dreaming of the missile? He lis-j 
tened but heard nothing out of the 
ordinary. She slept beside him. 
Somewhere a cricket chirped. 
Nevertheless, Jack thought he heard 
the echoes of dying sound. 

He began to move but gave it up.| 
Blissful peace bathed his senses. Hdf 
was at home, at last. She was hi£l 

now, as she had been meant to be.?

Their lives, separated by his karmic 
fall, had entwined again. He knew 
now how to win her favor, the 
Cosmic Flower’s soft embrace. 
Kindness woulcT do it. Love of man 
and beast. Love, even of brains en- 
cased in steel and wire. 

He heard a noise and stiffened. 
There was no help for it. He had to 
rise. 

He disentangled himself careful- 
ly, unwilling to wake her. The 
room was chilly and the tile floor 
downright cold. He was groping 
toward the wall, expecting a win- 
dow in that direction, when he 
heard shouts and the drum of 
horses’ hoofs on cobble-stone. He 
ran the rest of the way, found the 
window, and threw open the heavy 
shutters. 

The window opened on Phoenix 
Square. Moonlight bathed the 
scene. He saw motion to his right. 
Horses disappeared into one of the 
coiling streets, two lines of horses 
stretching some kind of netting be- 
tween them. Something gleamed like 
silver between the lines. Then they 
were gone. 

Jack looked up into the tower, fil- 
led with sudden insight. Frank J. 
Harmon, brain-missile, Godbod, 
had disappeared. 

Jack swallowed. He knew, sud- 
denly, that he had lost a friend. 


EPILOGUE 

It never came to a military clash 
between Phoenix and Plutonium. A 
delegation of the Hierarchy went 
through the city sniffing for the 
needle while the monkish thousands 
$at in siege outside the city walls. 

PLUTONIUM 


Satisfied, at last, Plutonium be- 
lieved a man called Tankers Jack 
who had done the negotiating. They 
went away to trail one Alans 
Shepherd, plutonium thief. 

Many years later word filtered 
back of a great new cult that had 
been started high up north, where 
the ice begins. The place attracted 
many pilgrims who went there to 
consult the oracle. Godbod had ap- 
peared to men, the rumors said. 
You asked it a question and it some- 
times answered and sometimes it 
said nothing. But you paid for your 
chance anyway and you had one 
turn of the sand-clock to make a go 
of it. When blind men came, the 
oracle always spoke, and many 
blind men settled in the region and 
sold their services. The guardians 
of Godbod grew powerful and rich. 
They built a great temple and called 
it Harmony. People said that it was 
gold and silver, inside and out, and 
that its bells were heard for many 
kemits, round about, echoing over 
the ice. 

The president-person of Phoenix 
married the scribe called Tankers 
Jack. She made him chief of her 
special priesthood, and they worked 
behind a high fence with all manner 
of mysteries. In a ceremony in 
Phoenix Square, right in front of 
the presidential pod, Zeronica 
changed her name again. She named 
herself Monica. She sent out runners 
to advertise the fact. They explained 
the meaning of her name so even dul- 
lards would get the picture. 

They lived happily ever after, she 
and he. And after . and af- 
ter .. and after . like figures 
between double mirrors, getting 
ever smaller in a stream of time. *

SCIENCE FACT | JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 

A STEP 

FARTHER 

OUT 

SURVIVAL WITH STYLE 

uddenly we’re all going to rises, then falls drastically in a 


die. Look around you: a spate of 
books, such as The Doomsday 
Book, Eco-Doom, and the like; and 
organizations such a “Friends of the 
Earth” and “Concerned Citizens” 
all say the same thing: Western 
civilization has been on an energy 
and resources spree, and it is time 
to call a halt. 

The arguments are largely based 
on a book called The Limits to 
Growth. Written by a management 
expert for a group of industrialists 
calling themselves The Club of 
Rome, Limits may be the most in- 
fluential book of this century. Its 
conclusions are based on a complex 
computer model of the world- 
system. The variables in the model 
are population, food production, in- 
dustrialization, pollution, and con- 
sumption of non-renewable re- 
sources. The results of the computer 
study are grim and unambiguous: 
unless we adopt Zero-Growth and 
adopt it now, we are doomed. 

The doom can take one of several 
forms, each less attractive than the 
others. In each case population 

76 


human die-off. “Quality of Life” 
falls hideously. Pollution rises ex- 
ponentially. 

Earth is a closed system, and we 
cannot continue to rape her as we 
have in the past; and if we do not 
learn restraint, we are finished. We 
have no alternative but Zero-Growth 
if we are to survive. One ZG advo- 
cate recently said, “We continue to 
hold out infinite human expectations 
in a finite world of finite resources. 
We continue to act as if what 
Daniel Bell calls ‘the revolution of 
rising expectations’ can be met 
when we all know they cannot.” 

Jay Forrester, whose MIT com- 
puter model is the main inspiration 
for Zero-Growth, goes much fur- 
ther. Birth control alone cannot do 
the job. It is clear from his model 
that only drastic reductions in health 
services, food supply, and indus- 
trialization can save the world- 
system from disaster. 

Behind all those numbers there is 
a stark reality: millions in the de- 
veloping countries shall remain in 
grinding poverty — forever. 


GALAXY 




And the West, under Zero- 
Growth, has only two choices: im- 
poverishment through really massive 
sharing with the developing 
counties — which must, however, 
cease to develop; or to retain wealth 
while most of the world remains at 
the end of the abyss. Neither alter- 
native is attractive, but there’s noth- 
ing else we can do. Failure to adopt 
Zero-Growth is no more than self- 
ishness, robbing our children for 
our own pleasures. 

So say the computers. 

Hr * * 

I can’t accept that. I want not 
only to survive, but to do it with 
style. I want to keep the good 
things of our high-energy technolog- 
ical civilization: stereo, rapid travel, 
easy communications, varied diet, 
plastic models, aspirin, freedom 
from toothache, science-fiction 
magazines, Selectric typewriters, 
Texas Instruments pocket comput- 
ers, fanzines, fresh vegetables in 
mid-winter, lightweight backpack 
and sleeping bag — the myriad pro- 
ducts that make our lives so much 
more varied than our grandfathers’. 

Moreover, I want to feel right 
about it; I do not call it survival 
with style if we must remain no 
more than an island of wealth in the 
midst of a vast sea of eternal pov- 
erty and misery. Style, to me, 
means that nearly everyone on Earth 
should have hope of access to some 
of the benefits of technology and 
industry. 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 


That’s a tall order. The 
economists say it can’t be filled. 
My wishes are admirable but irrele- 
vent. Their models prove that. 

I might accept their verdict if 
they had modeled the right system; 
but in my judgment they did not. 
They assumed that we live on 
Earth. If that were true, that Earth 
were a closed system, the only place 
or planet available to us — then ZG 
might be the best of a number of 
unpleasant alternatives. But suppose 
it isn’t. Suppose the economists 
have left something out of their 
models. 

* * * 

Arthur Clarke once said that 
when a greybearded scientist says 
something is possible, believe him; 
when he says that it’s impossible, 
he’s very likely wrong. That, I 
think, is as true in this case as any- 
where else. When the economists, 
those propounders of “the dismal 
science,” tell us that we are 
doomed, it’s time to take a fresh 
look at the problem. 

Forrester’s models are basically 
ready to kill us through lack of 
food, lack of non-renewable re- 
sources; and pollution. If we can 
lick those problems we’re all right. 
Oh, sure: there’s obviously a finite 
limit to the number of people the 
Earth can support. I know how to 
manipulate exponential curves as 
well as anyone, and if we project 
population growth mindlessly ahead 
we soon come to the point at which 


77 



the entire mass of the universe is 
converted into human flesh. So 
what? It isn’t going to happen; 
population growth always declines 
with increasing wealth. 

But there are powerful religions, 
whose adherents control large por- 
ions of the globe, that condemn 
birth control. 

Well, yes. And I’m no theolo- 
gian. But I cannot believe that any 
rational interpretation of scripture 
commands us to breed until we lit- 
erally have no place to sit. 

“So God created man in his own 
image, in the image of God created 
he him; male and female created he 
them. And God blessed them, and 
God said unto them, Be fruitful, 
and multiply, and replenish the 
earth, and subdue it; and have 
dominion over the fish of the sea, 
and over the fowl of the air, and 
over every living thing that moveth 
upon the earth.” 

I will leave theology to the 
theologians; but the command was, 
“Multiply and replenish the earth, 
and subdue it;” and surely there 
must come a time when that has 
been done ? When there can be no 
doubt that we have been sufficiently 
fruitful? And surely dominion over 
the wild things of the earth does not 
mean that we are to exterminate and 
replace them? Surely even those of 
the deepest faith may without blas- 
phemy wonder if we are not rapidly 
approaching a time when we shall 
indeed have replenished and sub- 
dued the earth? 


I cannot believe that we will con- 
tinue to breed until we have de- 
stroyed our world: and frankly, I 
think of no more certain way to in- 
sure that the developing countries 
continue to increase in population 
than to condemn them to eternal 
poverty through Zero-Growth. So 
let’s leave the bogey-man of unlim- 
ited population expansion. We 
have the technology to limit family 
size when, inevitably, there comes 
the time when everyone, no matter 
what his religious conviction, be- 
lieves that the earth has been re- 
plenished and subdued.

Our next problem is food produc- 
tion. Surprisingly, it’s nowhere near 
as critical as is generally supposed. 
Now whoa! Please don’t write me 
about ail the starving people in the 
world: I do know something about 
the situation. I’ve also interviewed 
senior officials of the UN’s Food 
and Agriculturural Organization. 
There are very few countries that 
could not, over a ten-year average 
period, raise enough food to give 
their populations more than enough 
to eat. 

The catch is the “over a ten-year 
period” part. The average crop 
production is sufficient, but 
drought, flood, and other natural 
disasters can produce famine 
through crop failures over a one, 
two, or three year period. You see, 
there’s no technology for storing the

surplus. The West has known for a 
long time about seven fat years fol- 
lowed by seven lean years, but it 
took us centuries to come up with 
reliable ways to meet the problems 
of famine. 

Our solutions have been two-fold: 
storage of food, and weaving the 
entire West into a single area 
through efficient transportation. 
Drought-stricken farmers in Kansas 
can be fed wheat from Washington, 
beef from the Argentine, and lettuce 
from California. 

But this takes industrial technol- 
ogy on a large scale. Even provid- 
ing mylar linings for traditional 
dung-smeared grain storage pits in 
Africa is a high-technology enter- 
prise. 

Next, we waste hell out of land. 
Let’s look at a few numbers. A 
hard-working person needs about 
7000 “large” Calories a day, or 7 
x 10 s gram-calories. The sun 
delivers 1.97 gram-calories/per 
square centimeter/per minute onto 
the Earth. Say about 10% of that 
gets through the atmosphere, and 
that the sun shines about 5 hours 
(300 minutes) per day on the aver- 
age. Further assume that our crops 
are about 1 % efficient in converting 
sunlight to edible energy. Simple 
multiplication shows that a patch 35 
meters on a side will feed a man — 
about a quarter of an acre. 

Ok. I’m being unfair. But I’m 
not all that far off; you should see 
what my greenhouse, 2.5 meters on a 
side, can produce in hydroponics

tanks; and there’s no energy wasted 
in distribution of the food. I do use 
electricity to run the pumps, but I’m 
lazy; hand work would do it. 

The joker, of course, is that I use 
chemical nutrients that take a lot of 
energy to manufacture. My 
greenhouse is made of aluminum 
tubing and mylar plastic with nylon 
reinforcements. All high-technology 
items, as are the fungicides I use, 
and even the water-testing kit that 
lets me balance pH in the nutrients. 

Hmmm. We’re back to indus- 
trialization again. Now it’s true 
enough that if the average Indian 
farmer could manage the productiv- 
ity level reached by the Japanese 
peasant of the 12th Century', India 
would have no food problems; but 
it’s not likely he’ll get there without 
industrial help; and meanwhile the 
Japanese have had to move far 
ahead of their 12th Century output 
levels. 


79 


But it should be obvious that suf- 
ficient levels of industrialization and 
technology will overcome the food 
production problem for a long time 
to come. To get ridiculous about it, 
if 1% of New York City were cov- 
ered with greenhouses, they would 
feed about 10% of the NY popula- 
tion; 1% greenhouses in Los 
Angeles would feed 1/3 of our LA 
population. Clearly food production 
per se isn’t going to be a limit to 
growth for a good long time; food 
production will be limited by an en- 
forced halt in industrialization and 
technology. 

* Hr * 

So now we come to the binding 
point. Our bottleneck is the penal- 
ties associated with industrializa- 
tion. If we can industrialize without 
polluting ourselves to death, or 
without running out of non- 
renewable resources, then we can 
all get rich; we can have survival 
with style. 

But how can we do that? 

In a series of articles in the “Other 
Magazine’’ (you know, the one 
with rivets), my friend G. Harry 
Stine described what he called 
The Third Industrial Revolution. 
Astute readers may even have no- 
ticed similarities between Harry’s 
articles and my stories; as indeed 
they should, for Harry’s articles 
were one of the most exciting 
events of my life. 

Oh, sure; intellectually I knew 


that we could do all sorts of mar- 
velous works in space; but Harry 
brought it home to me. His articles 
gave the feel of space industrial 
operations. In my judgement his 
phrase “Third Industrial Rev- 
olution” should become as stan- 
dard a term as “industrial revolution” 
is now. Should ; and I hope will; 
but it’s not inevitable. The Zero- 
Growth movement may strangle 
the Third Industrial Revolution 
in its cradle. 

Anyway, I’m pleased to say that 
Putnam’s is bringing out The Third 
Industrial Revolution, by G. Harry 
Stine, about the time this article 
will be published; and I recommend 
it to every reader who’s at all con- 
cerned about the future. 

Harry argues that when it’s 
steam-engine time, there will be 
steam engines; and when it’s space- 
industry time there will be space in- 
dustries. There I disagree; space op- 
erations are so capital-intensive — 
that is, require such enormous ini- 
tial investments — that they’re differ- 
ent from either steam engines or 
computers. By their nature, space 
industrial operations require access 
to space; and access is not available 
to the back-yard inventor, or even 
the fabulously rich eccentric. If I 
invent a better mousetrap, I can find 
an investor rich enough to build it; 
but for space industry there’s no 
firm or consortium of firms that can 
come up with the initial investment. 
If private enterprise ever gets ac- 
cess to space, the game’s over;

we’ll get the Third Industrial Re- 
volution whether we want it or not; 
but if the anti-technology chaps 
have their way, the Shuttle will be 
turned into new busses for transport- 
ing children across town, school 
lunches, higher welfare payments, 
compulsory seat belts in automo- 
biles, subsidies for tobacco growers, 
and public campaigns to “fight nu- 
clear pollution.” 

Let’s assume that somehow we 
get to space, though; how does that 
help us with industrialization? How 
will that enable us to survive with 
style? 

From here on, while I will keep 
them simple and work it so that you 


don’t have to follow them to under- 
stand my conclusions, I’m going to 
have to use some mathematics; in 
particular I must introduce a way to 
measure and speak precisely about 
energy. 

The basic energy measurement is 
the erg. It’s an incredibly tiny unit; 
about the amount of energy used up 
when a mosquito jumps off the 
bridge of your nose. In order to deal 
with meaningful quantities of 
energy, we have to use powers-''*' 
ten notation. Example: 10 2 = 100; 
10 4 = 1000; and 10 28 is 1 followed 
by 28 zeros. 

The table is included to give 
some feel for the numbers.

We’re concerned about non- 
renewable resources and pollution, 
right? Let’s go to space and solve 
both problems. 

Probably the worst offender in 
both categories is metal production; 
give us enough iron and steel, cop- 
per, aluminum, zinc and lead, and 
surely we’ll have our problems 
licked. After all, it’s mine tailings 
that produce some of the really hor- 
rible pollution; copper refineries that 
poison so many streams; and those 
belching steel mills that make 
Pittsburgh a sight to behold (if you 
can see it through the smoke); and 
it’s processing all those metals that 
really bums up the energy. 

Give us metals free and clear, 
and the rest is easy. Give us enough 
metals and we’ll industrialize the 
world. Besides, if we can do that in 
space, we can probably do anything 
else that has to be done. Con- 
sequently, I’ll use metal production 
as my illustrative example. 

In 1967, the last year I have 
complete figures for, the United 
States produced 315 million tons of 
iron, steel, rolled iron, aluminum, 
copper, zinc, and lead. (I added up 
all the numbers in the almanac to 
get that figure.) It works out to 
2.866 x 10 14 grams of metal. As- 
sume we must work with 3%-rich 
ore, and we have 9.6 x 10 15 grams 
of ore to work with, or 10.5 billion 
tons. 

It sure sounds like a lot. To get 
some feel for the magnitude of the 
problem, let’s put it all together into 

82 


one big pile. Assuming our ore 
weighs about 3.5 grams/cubic cen- 
timeter, we have 2.73 X 10 15 cm 3 , 
or a block 1.39 x 10 s cm on a 
side. Whoa. That’s a block less 
than 1.5 kilometers on a side; some- 
thing more than a cubic kilometer, 
less than a cubic mile. Or, if you 
like it as a spherical rock, it’s less 
than two kilometers in diameter. 

There are something more the 
300,000 rocks that size in the as- 
teroids, and 3% ore isn’t too bad a 
guess at their composition. Hmmm. 

But we’re dealing with the world, 
not the USA, so let’s give the 
whole world the per capita metal 
production of the US; since we ex- 
port a good bit of ours anyway, 
surely that’s enough. So we take 
our 315 million tons and multiply 
by 2.2 billion, and divide by 200 
million, to get 3.465 billion tons of 
pure metal, 1.05 x IQ 17 grams of 
3% ore. That’s 3 x 10 18 cm 3 , or a 
rock 4 kilometers in diameter. There 
are well over 100,000 of those out in 
the Belt. 

Well, we won’t run out of metals. 
Only, of course, we have to process 
those metals. 

For a moment forget it’s out 
there in the Belt and imagine our 
rock is now in orbit around Earth. 
We want to get the metals out of it. 
Let’s assume we do it by brute 
force. We’re going to boil the 
whole rock. 

It takes about 2000 calories per 
gram to boil iron. That’s about the 
worst case for us, so we’ll imagine 


GALAXY 



our rock is entirely iron for the 
moment. It’s going to take a lot of 
energy: 8.8 x 10 27 ergs, to be 
exact. That’s something like 
twenty thousand megatons. Where’ll 
we get the energy? 

Hmm. The sun delivers at Earth 
orbit 1.37 million ergs a second per 
square centimeter, and out in space 
we can catch that with mirrors. 
There are 31 million seconds in a 
year, or 4.32 x 10 13 ergs/cm 2 -year 
out there. W'e need 2 x 10 14 cm 2 
of mirror, or one big round one 80 
kilometers radius. Too big; even in 
zero-g that would be unwieldly. But 
a hundred of them 8 km radius 
doesn’t sound so bad; or even a 
thousand at 1.6 kilometers radius. 

Of course my mirrors aren’t 
going to be 100% efficient — but 
then I’m not going to boil the whole 
blooming rock either. Nor do I seri- 
ously propose that we bring in the 
entire world metal supply from 
space, or that all that metal is simply 
consumed with no recycling. I’m 
looking for ballpark figures. 

Note, by the way, that there’s 
been absolutely no pollution on 
Earth so far. All the waste is out 
there where it can’t hurt us. But 
we’ve still got problems, of course. 
After all, my metals are not in Earth 
orbit; they’re out there in the Belt 
and they’ve got to be moved here — 
and that’s going to take energy. 

So let’s see what it does take. To 
get from Ceres to Earth you’ve got 
to have a change in velocity — that’s 
delta-vee — of about 7 kilometers a 


second. By definition energy is 
mass given a velocity change, so 
we can quickly figure out how 
much energy we need by the for- 
ula KE = x /i mv 2 , and come up 
with 2.45 x 10 11 ergs for every 
gram moved into Earth orbit from 
Ceres. We’re going to move our 
whole rock, all 10 17 grams of it, so 
we’ll need 2.6 x 10 28 ergs just to 
move it; about 10% of the world’s 
present annual energy budget; not 
excessive in return for our entire 
metal supply. 

But 10 28 ergs is a lot of energy, 
and we’re far away from the sun; I 
can’t use sunlight for that. (Maybe I 
can, but we’ll rule it out.) 

So I need 61,000 one-megaton 
hydrogen bombs, which is quite a 
few; best 1 find another way. Note 
that if I don’t find another way I 
may yet use the bombs; we needn’t 
worry about radiation and fallout 
and the like out in space. My 
bombs are nothing compared to 
what the solar wind is doing during 
a flare. But how else might I work 
the transportation problem? 

I need an invention: hydrogen fu- 
sion, which gives me, if I’ve got an 
efficient reaction, 6.4 x 10 18 ergs 
per gram of hydrogen “burned”. 
I’m unlikely to have 100% ef- 
ficiency, so you can multiply the 
number I come up with by whatever 
factor makes you happiest. If you 
think my system is 10% efficient, 
try that. I’ve already described back 
last July one kind of space drive 
that will work given fusion. 


A STEP FARTHER OUT 


83 



So I apply my fusion-ion drive, 
and discover I need to fuse 4 x10 s 
grams of hydrogen, which sounds 
like a lot, but it’s really only 4000 
metric tons, not so very much after 
all; quite a small ship could carry it. 
It’s the amount of hydrogen in 
something like a cubic kilometer of 
water once I’ve thrown away the 
oxygen (which surely isn’t pollut- 
ing!) and we’ve got a lot of cubic 
kilometers of water on Earth. 

I’ll also need to get my hydrogen 
out to Ceres from Earth, which re- 
quires 9 X 10 21 ergs, less than a 
Saturn rocket can deliver, or the 
energy obtained in fusing another 
1.5 kilograms of hydrogen. Clearly 
we’re not going to run out of hyd- 
rogen for a long, long time. Even if 
we must go to deuterium — “heavy” 
hydrogen — we won’t run short; and 
recall, there’s likely to be some ice 
out there in space. We may not 
need to do all our hydrogen proces- 
sing here on Earth. 

So. For the price of one to a few 
thousand cubic kilometers of water 
each year we’ve brought home all the 
metals we need to give the entire 
population of Earth as much metal 
as the US produced in 1969. If we 
do nothing else in space — if we 
come up with no startlingly new 
processes as described by Harry 
Stine in his fascinating book — we’ll 
have licked pollution and dwindling 
resources, thereby letting the de- 
veloping countries industrialize, and 
thereby whipping the food produc- 
tion crisis for a while. 


Sure: there’s a limit to growth. 
But with all of space to play with, 
I’ll be happy to leave the problem 
for my descendents of 10,000 years 
hence to worry about. 

I can hear the critics sputtering 
now. “But-but-but — what does this 
madman thing he’s doing ? Flinging 
numbers like that around! It’s ab- 
surd!” 

Really? Remember, we fling 
quantities like Jhat here on Earth 
right now; and I’ve after all as- 
sumed that we’re going to supply 
the whole world with metals at the 
rate we produce them from all 
sources — including recycling — here 
at ground level US of A. What’s so 
absurd about it? Oh, no, we won’t 
be operating on this scale for a few 
years; but then we weren’t produc- 
ing all those tons of steel back in 
1930 either. Even Forrester’s worst 
crunch model doesn’t finish us off 
before 2020 — a year in which we 
might very well be able to move as- 
teroids around, boil them up for 
processing, and bring the resulting 
metals down for use on Earth. 
There’s exactly as much time be- 
tween now and 1930 as now and 
2020. 

Yes, we live on a finite Earth; 
but there’s a whole solar system out 
there, just waiting for us to use it. 
We’ve only to lift our heads out of 
the muck to find not only survival, 
but survival with style. 

I think I’ll continue this column 
next month. There’s so much more 
we can do. ★

j- One 

Looking back, Bart could never 
clearly remember any part of his 
life before the day when the Ship 
first woke him from a long, artifi- 
cially induced sleep, and guided 
him to the nursery to see the babies. 
That day and the first few that fol- 
lowed were very confusing to live 
through. 

The Ship’s machines, working 
with paint and glass and light, had 
made the nursery spacious-looking 
and cheerful. Bart counted twenty- 
four cribs. To count babies would 
have been harder, because only 
those who happened to be napping 
were in their beds. The rest crawled 
or sat or toddled on the soft-tiled 
deck, sending up a racket and get- 
ting underfoot of their attending 
machines and images. The babies 
were all the same age, just about a 
year old the day Bart first saw 
them. They wore white diapers, and 
some had on green hospital gowns 
like Bart’s only of course smaller. 

Bart was not tall for almost fourteen 
but he could easily lift one bare leg 
after the other over the low barrier 
the machines had placed to keep the 
little kids from tottering or crawling 
out of the nursery into the corridor. 
The corridor led in one direction to 
Bart’s small private room and in the 
other — so his memory, working in a 
new, selective way, informed 
him — to the rest of the habitable 
Ship. 

The babies squalled, gurgled, 
blubbered, or took time out to stare 
in silence at the world. They made 
nothing much of Bart’s coming in 
among them. The images that the 
machines kept projecting and mov- 
ing around the infants were of 

86 


solid-looking adult humans, speak- 
ing and smiling; they evidently took 
Bart to be just one more image. The 
babies reacted more strongly to the 
machines because of the physical 
contact they had with them. 

“Pick one up, if you wish,” the 
Ship said in his ear. It was able to 
project its conversation so there was 
no way of telling just what direction 
the words came from. The Ship’s 
voice sounded human, but not quite 
male or female, not quite young or 
old. 

Like a good obedient boy Bart 
bent to have a try at picking up a 
baby. The chubby belly felt cool 
against his hands above the papery 
diaper and the head of dark, scanty 
curls turned so that the liquid brown 
eyes could stare at him uncertainly. 

‘‘See how the machines hold 
them,” counseled the Ship. “Their 
arms are of basically the same form 
as yours.” 

He shifted his grip. 

“The prime directives under 
which I operate are very clear. One 
human parent, adoptive or real, is 
necessary to the successful matura- 
tion of children; images and 
machines are psychologically in- 
adequate for optimum results. 
Therefore, after receiving some 
elementary preparation for the role, 
you will serve as adoptive parent 
for the first generation of colonists. ’ ’ 
Colonists. The word evoked in 
Bart the abstract knowledge that the 
Ship had started from an orbit 
around Earth, and was outward 
bound to seed humanity somewhere 
among the stars. How long ago the 
voyage had begun, and whether he 
himself had witnessed that begin- 
ning, were questions that his mem- 

GALAXY 



ory could not answer. Nor did he 
feel any urgency attached to them. 
Somewhere in Bart’s lost past he 
had learned that the Ship was to be 
trusted utterly and now he could 
wait patiently fpr a better under- 
standing of what it meant by its an- 
nouncement that he was to be a pa- 
rent. Meanwhile he watched the in- 
fants, played a little with them, and 
tried to comfort and distract those 
who cried. It seemed to be the thing 
to do. 

The machines labored ceaseless- 
ly, patting, changing, feeding, 
washing, wiping up. Twice they 
dispensed cups of soup-like stuff for 
Bart to drink. There were no clocks 
to watch but he was certain that he 
had been in the nursery for hours. 
At last, one of the machines took 
him lightly by the arm and pointed 
back down the corridor whence he 
had come. 

When he had closed himself into 
his little plastic-walled bedroom the 
Ship’s voice said: “You will be giv- 
en a substantial breakfast when 
you wake again. That will be one 
standard year from now.” 

Two 

He awoke as on the first day, as 
if from a sound night’s sleep, and at 
once sat up to look over the rim of 
his bed, which curved around him 
like a padded bathtub, warm and 
dry and clean. Just how he was be- 
ing put to sleep or awakened he 
didn’t know, but certainly there was 
more to it than he could see or feel; 
somehow his gown had been taken 
off him while he slept and he was 
naked. 

There was a new gown laid out 
on the room’s single small chair, or 

birthdays 


the same one, washed clean of baby 
shit and pablum, and he put it on 
after using the toilet and washing 
his hands and face. From a panel in 
the wall he got his promised break- 
fast, consisting of a warm, milky 
drink in a plastic cup, and a tray 
holding chunks of bread, the bread- 
crust hot and crunchy and with 
pieces of fruit and cheese inside. 

One standard year, the Ship had 
said . but his hands looked no 
bigger, nor did the muscles in his 
thin arms. His face looked no differ- 
ent in the wall mirror, and the fine 
tawny hair on his head had main- 
tained its crewcut length. There 
were still no more than a couple of 
dozen brown pubic hairs curling at 
the bottom of his belly and he was 
sure he was no taller. 

When he got to the nursery, 
though, he could well believe a year 
had passed: it certainly had if these 
were the same kids. A few were in 
their beds as before, but now those 
lying stretched out almost filled the 
little cribs. The majority were run- 
ning about, keeping their balance 
reasonably skillfully for the most 
part, and busy with a multitude of 
toys. They wore shirts now, and 
shorts or pants over their diapers. 

This time the babies were aware 
that Bart was more than just another 
image, and some of them took 
fright at first and clung to the 
machines. But he kept walking 
around and talking to them, as the 
Ship instructed him to, and soon 
they started to warm up to him. 

Again he spent the day in 
socializing, and this time shared the 
little kids’ food when it was dis- 
pensed by the machines. Meaty- 
tasting, mildly chewy chunks of 

87 



stuff, and harder, biscuit-like ob- 
jects that came in both sweet and 
sour flavors, it tasted good enough 
to be adult fare. Last year — 
yesterday — the babies had been 
drinking from nippled bottles, but 
today they got water and colored 
drinks in little cups. 

Though he hadn’t questioned the 
Ship on it, Bart was still thinking 
over the announcement that he was 
to be a parent. He could imagine 
himself at the head of an enormous 
dining table, all these kids, grown a 
little older, sitting round it, but 
beyond that his imagination was 
soon lost. He told himself to be pa- 
tient; the Ship would provide expla- 
nations and instructions as they be- 
came necessary. 

The continual racket was weary- 
ing. By the time the babies were all 
bedded down for what must be their 
regular night’s sleep, with the lights 
dimmed, he was ready to go to 
sleep himself. At a word from the 
Ship, he walked back yawning to 
his room. 

Three 

Again he seemed to be experienc- 
ing nothing more than an ordinary 
night of restful slumber, and again 
when he awoke he hadn’t grown or 
gotten older. This time he found a 
pair of shorts and a pullover shirt 
laid out for him. 

After dressing and breakfast he 
walked to the nursery. Before he 
got there he could hear a year’s 
worth of change in the children’s 
voices, forming clear words now as 
they called to one another. 

When the new glass doors of the 
nursery opened to let Bart in, he 
saw that bigger beds had been in- 

88 


stalled, and the walls moved back 
to make more space for play. The 
kids looked different — and bigger 
again, of course. After an initial 
shyness, not so intense as yester- 
day’s, they all came crowding 
around Bart so that he walked 
through a little sea of waist-high 
heads. Here and there a bulge of 
diaper still peeped out of someone’s 
shorts. 

“What’s your name?” one tiny 
voice cried out, insistent above the 
babble of the others. 

“Bartley. Everyone calls me 
Bart.” Who had called him that? 
Family? Friends? There were still 
no specific memories available. 
“What’s yours?” 

“Armin.” Or maybe Ermin 
was what the child answered. Bart 
wasn’t sure if the speaker was a girl 
or a boy. The group seemed about 
evenly divided as to sex. 

Again he ate and played with 
them through the day. This time all 
accepted his presence unquestion- 
ingly before an hour had passed — 
though he didn’t get the feeling that 
any of them recalled his earlier vis- 
its. Today, he noticed, there were 
fewer projected images of adults 
about. 

A little girl who said her name 
was Deirdre brought him a wheeled 
plastic toy whose axle had come 
loose from its containing grooves. 
He forced it back into place, so the 
wheels could turn again, and 
Deirdre carried it off, after a 
machine had made her stand still 
until she said “Thank you, Bart.” 

Counting as well as he could in 
the continuing melee, Bart decided 
that there were twelve girls and 
twelve boys in the group. 


GALAXY 



After dinner, when the machines 
had begun to pack the kids off to 
their beds, the Ship said to Bart: 
“You may remain awake for a few 
more hours if you wish.” 

He felt tired out, but not ready to 
sleep. “Maybe I’ll read a book.” 

‘‘I will provide some in your 
room.” 

Stretched out on his bed, he 
stared at a book for awhile without 
reading, then put it down and asked 
the air: “How long have I been 
here, in the Ship?” 

“I have edited your memories of 
your past life for good reason. Your 
past contains tragic and violent 
things. Nothing can be done about 
the past. We must work for the fu- 
ture and achieve a successful re- 
vised mission.” 

“Are there any other people on 
board besides me and the little 
kids?” 

“None. Much depends on you.” 
He lay there looking at the cover 
of The Young Detectives Visit 
Earth. Although his bed was com- 
fortable and he was tired he didn’t 
think he was going to be able to 
sleep. 

But he really had no choice. 


Four 

Again, either his shorts and shirt 
were washed for him as he slept or 
it was a clean new outfit that he 
found on the chair. Breakfast as be- 
fore, and he was on his way. The 
books had been removed and there 
was nothing else to do. 

Two boys and two girls, grown 
bigger since he saw them last, were 
playing just inside the children’s 
compound; Bart decided it couldn’t 

birthdays. 


be thought of as a nursery any 
more. As he approached the four 
caught sight of him and jumped 
with excitement, calling out to 
others, their voices coming to Bart 
faintly through the heavy glass 
doors. 

As he entered it, Bart saw that 
their compound had been enlarged 
again. There were no more adult 
images in sight. Children came, 
hesitantly at first, from everywhere, 
some pedaling vehicles, others 
emerging from toy houses of mul- 
ticolored blocks. 

“Hi, I’m Bart,” he said to those 
who gathered close around. “Any- 
body remember me?” 

“The Ship told us you were com- 
ing to see us today,” a bold little 
girl spoke as she pushed forward. 
“Look, look, see the picture I 
drew?” It was a row of a dozen or 
so little circle-faces, each the same 
size, with lines for hair and nose 
and eyes, and one large face above. 
“That’s you.” In a corner the 
artist’s name stood in big shaky 
letters: SHARON. 

As the day went on Bart heard 
the names of all the other kids, 
though he remembered only a few. 
He spent his time in play with one 
group and another, and then read 
them all stories from a book about 
old Earth as they sat around him on 
the floor. When the Ship directed, 
he saw them off to bed. 

“Am I being a good enough par- 
ent, Ship?” 

“The revised mission plan is pro- 
ceeding satisfactorily.” 


Five 

All twenty-four of them were 

89 



waiting for him excitedly just inside 
the heavy glass doors. This time 
they all remembered him. 

“We’re five now, Bart!” 

“Ship says we can have a birth- 
day party if we want — ” 

“ — like Billy and Lynn — ” 

It took him a while to figure out 
that Billy and Lynn were characters 
in some children’s story the Ship 
showed them from time to time. 
Lynn and Billy were twins, back on 
Earth somewhere, and in one 
episode they had evidently enjoyed 
an elaborate birthday celebration, 
complete with cake, candy, and ice 
cream. 

“How old are you, Bart?” 

“Will you have a birthday with 
us?” 

“Sure. If the Ship will give us 
cake and things. Maybe we can 
have some real candles.” 

“Yayy!” 

So they had the party, the Ship 
providing real candles and entrust- 
ing Bart with a lighter for them. 
The machines even brought forth 
small paper-wrapped toys as pres- 
ents for all the five-year-olds. 
“Din’choo get a present, Bart?” 
“No, it’s not my birthday.” 
“When is?” 

“In about a couple of months.” 
The precise date was something else 
still sitting undisturbed in his mem- 
ory, with blank holes knocked all 
around it. “This was fun. Listen, 
maybe we can have another birth- 
day party when I come back tomor- 
row. You’ll all be six, if the Ship 
keeps me on the same schedule.” 
“Tomorrow?” 

“Well — next year. See, you and 
I are running on different schedules; 
I’m only awake one day every year. 

90 


1 expect the Ship’ll put us on the 
same time schedule soon.” 

“Next year?” 

Bart sighed, seeing that for them 
the difference between tomorrow 
and next year was not too clear. 
Especially the way he was talking. 

Six 

This year the difference in time 
schedules was much easier for them 
to grasp. So were a lot of other 
things. 

Again the compound in which the 
children lived had been trans- 
formed. Part of it had become what 
Bart recognized as a school, and 
everybody was busy at teaching- 
machine consoles when he arrived. 

The Ship’s voice then declared a 
holiday for them all. 

“Let’s have our birthday party!” 
a boy cried out. 

And after Bart had talked with 
them all, and read them a new story 
as the Ship directed, and had been 
shown through the school by his 
small friends, machines wheeled out 
a big cake. This time there were 
balloons as well as little gifts of 
toys and candy. 

“Isn’t it your birthday too, 
Bait?” 

“Well, no. Mine’s coming in 
about a couple of months ... in 
two months and two days.” 

“How old will you be?” 

“Fourteen.” 

After the cake and ice cream was 
finished they had a good time play- 
ing games. The kids were awed by 
Bart’s strength and speed and dex- 
terity, and he taught them some of 
the skills he knew for games with 
balls and ropes and sticks. Now and 
then someone who got bumped hard 

GALAXY 



in a game took time out to cry. Bart 
thought he could tell quicker and 
better than the machines just how 
serious the damage was. 


Seven 

Before the seventh-birthday party 
got started, Bart went through a 
period of rather intense questioning 
by a few of the kids; Fuad and Ran- 
jan and Ora wanted to know what 
he was doing all the time they 
didn’t see him, where and how he 
spent the year between birthdays. 

“I’m sleeping. The Ship can fix 
it so a person just sleeps all the 
time.” 

“Huh,” said Ranjan, doubtfully. 

“Why does it want you to sleep 
all the time?” asked Ora. Today 
she had a loose front tooth she kept 
wiggling with her tongue. 

“I don’t know,” Bart admitted, 
feeling foolish. 

“Don’t you get hungry?” Fuad 
wanted to know. 

“No. I guess it’s not like regular 
sleep. “ Some vague knowledge of 
the process was available in his im- 
personal memory. “It’s something 
like being frozen, only you never 
feel cold.” 

This year the games v were 
rougher. When two or three of the 
boys grabbed Bart by the legs at 
once, they could tip him over. 

Back in his room alone after din- 
ner, he asked: “Ship, am I really 
helping much, being a parent, if I 
just come out once a year? How 
long will I be on this schedule?” 

“You will not be on this 
schedule for any substantial portion 
of your lifetime. A definite time 
limit cannot be set now, but all 

BIRTHDAYS 


computation on the matter is pro- 
ceeding properly.” 

He tried again a little later, be- 
fore going to sleep, but got essen- 
tially the same answer. 

Eight 

When Bart walked into the 
schoolroom something like boy-girl 
war was going on, the place in dis- 
array, the weaker or more timid 
children in tears, the more aggres- 
sive screaming insults at one 
another and hurling toys and writing 
materials back and forth as missiles, 
oveP bookshelves and teaching 
machines turned into parapets. 
Adult images had been brought out 
by the Ship and were calling sternly 
and uselessly for order, and out- 
numbered machines were shaking 
some of the worst offenders by the 
arm and lecturing. 

“Ship, can I help?” Bart cried. 
“Yes. Two boys have got to a 
lower deck and should be brought 
back up.” Ship’s voice was calm 
and methodical as always, though 
somewhat louder than usual to be 
heard plainly above the screaming. 
“My machines are busy, and it 
would be helpful if you went after 
the boys and got them to come up 
again. Go down the stairs at the end 
of the corridor to your right.” 

It was a passageway he hadn’t 
been in before, evidently one re- 
cently opened up by the ongoing en- 
largement of the living quarters. He 
found the two truants, Tang and 
Mai, without much trouble; there 
wasn’t much of the lower level 
open to their exploration, only a 
loop of corridor sealed off by heavy 
glass doors at all other points where 
other passages intersected. The stair 

91 



also was sealed where it went on 
down to still lower regions of the 
Ship. 

The boys were glad to see Bart 
and willing to go back with him; 
they had seen enough of the sights 
down here, interesting though they 
were. Through the various sets of 
glass doors you could see other cor- 
ridors stretching away for hundreds 
of meters at least. Many other doors 
were visible, some of which stood 
open to reveal static glimpses of 
rooms furnished for human life, but 
unused and empty of movement. 
The lights were dim in that large 
world outside the glass, and there 
was not a footstep on the dustless, 
polished-looking floors. 

“I wonder if anybody lives 
there,” Mai had asked, nose against 
the glass. 

“Nobody does,” said Tang. 
“Let’s go back up.” 

“Maybe we will someday,” Mai 
said in a small thoughtful voice. 

Nine 

The war between the sexes was 
not raging today, but it still smol- 
dered, as Bart could tell readily 
enough from the grimacing and 
hair-pulling and name-calling that 
flared sporadically during the day. 
The cake and ice cream lunch was a 
success, as usual, and the games 
were fun, though now he had to 
exert himself somewhat to outdo 
some of the other players. 

A girl and a boy had a brief ar- 
gument about what mathematical 
formula should be used to calculate 
the volume of the basketball they 
were playing with, and with a start 
Bart realized that now some of 
these kids knew things, maybe im- 

92 


portant things, that he had never 
learned. And he was supposed to be 
their parent! Or was it possible he 
had misunderstood what the Ship 
was saying? 

These things still bothered him 
when the day was over and he had 
undressed and climbed back into his 
isolated bed. “Ship.” 

“Yes.” 

. nothing.” He decided to let 
well enough alone. Ship rarely gave 
him a helpful answer anyway. And 
he wasn’t really all that anxious to 
be a father, at least not until he was 
older. 

Ten 

Eating his usual breakfast, Bart 
felt for the first time a little anxious 
about meeting the people he was 
going to find waiting for him in the 
compound. If they were all another 
year older, they wouldn’t be so 
much like small kids any more, but 
people with whom he would have to 
interact almost as an equal. He 
shook off his misgivings and 
walked out. 

The kids weren’t enormously 
bigger today, but it was certainly 
time to celebrate their collective 
tenth birthday, and they reminded 
Bart of this right after their first 
whoops of welcome. They had a 
big calendar drawn on the wall 
now, and had been crossing off 
days, and there was no doubt that 
another year had passed. 

Today when several of the boys 
ganged up on Bart in a rough game 
they easily pushed him around. Not 
that there had been any plan on 
their part to gang up on him, or that 
they were not still impressed by his 
strength. 


GALAXY 



And this year there were certain 
moments, talking to the girls, when, 
oddly, Bart felt almost bashful. 

Eleven 

Suddenly some of the boys, 
Baruch and Olen in particular, were 
almost as tall as Bart himself. And 
Deirdre and Sigrid were starting to 
round out into the shapes of wo- 
men; only just starting, but you 
could tell the process had begun. 

Right in the middle of the cake- 
eating, the birthday party turned 
solemn, and there was a long sober 
discussion of early memories and 
hopes for the future. 

All of them except Bart shared as 
some of their major lifetime 
memories the things that he had 
seen during the last eleven days — 
the old nursery, the parental images 
and the guardian machines, the toys 
and teaching devices. Of course he 
had missed the greater part of their 
history, but he had a sampling of it. 

They sat there soberly sipping 
their sweet party drinks and talking. 
When it came Bart’s tum to recount 
his early memories, he explained 
that the Ship must have scrambled 
them for him in some way, erasing 
large sections. “I don’t even know 
if I was raised out of the machines 
like you, or if my biological parents 
were on board, or if I was bom on 
Earth.” 

No one could give him any help 
with those questions. The talk went 
on for a long, moody time before 
they got around to playing games. 

Twelve 

Bart found himself looking up at 
Baruch, and level-eyed at a number 
of the other kids. The Ship was al- 

BIRTHDAYS 


lowing them more freedom now, 
and everyone except Trac, who had 
a stomach-ache, had come to meet 
Bart right outside his room, the 
doors of which could only be 
opened by the Ship. Even Tang was 
there, though hobbling on a broken 
leg he said he had got by falling 
two decks down a stairwell. Ship’s 
medical machines had neatly fixed 
the bones and told him he was heal- 
ing. 

Today the kids’ collective attitude 
was at first so grown-up and 
businesslike that Bart was almost in- 
timidated. They explained to him 
that they had just formed them- 
selves into a society, modeled on 
old societies of Earth that they had 
studied through the teaching 
machines. Baruch had been elected 
president, and others chosen to fill 
at least half a dozen additional of- 
fices. 

Even the birthday party began in 
an atmosphere of formality, but 
things soon loosened up. Bait was 
still stronger than Baruch, and could 
outwrestle him with an effort. But 
stocky Kichiro was now slightly 
stronger than he. 

Thirteen 

Chao, this month’s president, an- 
nounced early in the morning that 
this year’s party was going to be a 
thirteenth birthday celebration for 
Bart as well as all the others. All 
the others chorused agreement, and 
Bart went along without protest, 
though he knew full well he had 
passed his real thirteenth birthday 
many months ago. He had not the 
slightest idea whether there had 
been any party to mark the event, 
so he enjoyed this one as his due. 

93 



All through the day the girls paid 
him a great deal of attention, to 
which he reacted confusedly, enjoy- 
ing it all one moment and feeling 
tongue-tied and awkward the next. 
He could tell some of the boys were 
getting jealous. 

Every night recently he had been 
saying goodnight with the feeling of 
saying farewell, knowing that never 
again would he meet the same 
people he was leaving. Tonight he 
tried to stay with them, but one of 
the machines came and took him 
gently by the arm and led him from 
the group toward his room. He 
looked round at the other children’s 
faces, and saw sympathy but no 
help, and knew he had to go. 


Fourteen 

Every morning now he went to 
greet some strangers, boys and girls 
he had heard about indirectly but 
had never seen before. They resem- 
bled other kids he had met yester- 
day, and had their names, but that 
was all. Their bodies were melting 
and altering almost while Bart 
watched, flesh inflating and stretch- 
ing over elongating bones; boys’ 
faces sprouting elementary whiskers 
while their voices deepened, girls’ 
breasts growing, girls’ legs curving 
and rounding to spell out disturbing 
secret messages in visual code. 

And today they could literally 
talk over his head. Bart was small 
for his age. That’s what — who was 
it? — always used to say. 

During the party, right in the 
middle of the ice cream and cake, a 
fistfight broke out between Fritz and 
Kichiro. They slugged away at each 
other so hard that Bart saw he 

94 


wouldn’t be able to stand up to 
either of them for ten seconds. 

The machines just stood around 
like dummies and made no move to 
halt the fight. Fay, the current pres- 
ident, had to yell repeatedly to get 
other kids to step in and break it 
up. 

As soon as things had settled 
down a little, some of the kids be- 
gan drifting out of the room in 
pairs, a boy and a girl together kis- 
sing and maybe pawing at each 
other as they left Bart felt strange 
and almost frightened. The kids that 
remained in the dining hall talked 
and giggled and talked, talked, 
talked. The conversation was about 
nothing important, but still it 
seemed important that it be going 
on. 

Edris came to sit near Bart and 
talk talk talk with him. A red rib- 
bon tied up her brown hair, but a 
few strands fell loose down as far 
as the halter that covered her 
breasts. Solon got jealous and came 
over and started an argument. Soon 
he and Bart were trying to think up 
insults to call each other. 

Bart shoved Solon, who was not 
too big for him to think of fighting, 
and Solon punched Bart on the 
cheek, so his mouth started to bleed 
inside. Bart hit back, and then they 
grabbed each other and wrestled in 
deadly earnest to see who could get 
the other down. With furniture in 
the way they couldn’t come to any 
clean conclusion. Bart saw that a 
couple of machines were hovering 
near, and Edris was watching with 
enjoyment. Pretty soon some of the 
big kids grabbed the combatants and 
broke up the fight. 

The social atmosphere was a little 

GALAXY 



strained for the rest of the day, and 
Bart went back to his room earlier 
than usual, before the machines 
came to urge him along. 

He sat on his room’s one chair, 
arms folded. “Ship, I’m not being a 
parent. What am I really supposed 
to be doing?” 

“Further instructions will be giv- 
en you as required.” 

“Are you still going to wake me 
up only once a year?” 

“The mission is proceeding ac- 
cording to its revised schedule.” 

He got up and tried to walk out 
of the room again, but found the 
door immovable. 

He wondered if something vital 
could be wrong with the Ship. 
Might not its planning computers 
have broken down like so many 
common machines and be making 
hideously wrong decisions? Though 
his bland, smoothed-out memory 
suggested this was impossible, Bart 
went worriedly to bed. Sleep was 
still mechanically fast in coming. 

Fifteen 

Solon had grown alarmingly large 
and it was with relief that Bart saw 
him smile in a friendly if distracted 
way. The inside of Bart’s mouth 
was still sore from yesterday but 
Solon said hello as if he didn’t re- 
call their fight at all. 

Bart’s former opponent had other 
matters on his mind, and returned 
quickly to a conversation he was 
conducting in fierce whispers with 
Fritz and Himyar and one or two 
other boys. It was shortly con- 
cluded, and the bunch of them took 
off, running grimly and purpose- 
fully down a corridor. Bart looked 
around and realized there was no 


one left in the common room with 
him but half a dozen girls, most of 
whom looked worried. 

Galina and Vivian came over to 
Bart and started trying to explain. It 
seemed that the boys were now di- 
vided into two gangs, of six mem- 
bers each, and between the gangs 
existed something like open war. 

“They’ve been fighting this way 
off and on for months now,” 
Galina told him. “Always getting 
black eyes and bloody noses. Today 
looks like it might be one of the 
worst. It started today over whether 
we should have another birthday 
party or not.” Galina, who was 
rather plain, was solemn most of 
the time, usually giving the impres- 
sion she favored sobriety and order. 
“And the trouble is that now half 
the girls have gotten involved too.” 

Helsa and Lotis also came over, 
and the girls debated whether there 
was anything they could do to stop 
impending hostilities. All around 
them the Ship was quiet, ominously 
so, Bart felt. He stood by, feeling 
dangerously out of it all. He didn’t 
even know the layout of the pas- 
sages the girls talked about as they 
tried to guess where their male 
friends might be planning fights or 
ambushes. 

While the other girls kept on talk- 
ing to one another, Lotis came to 
Bart and with a gesture got him to 
follow her off into the Ship. 

“Where’re we going?” he asked, 
supposing some plan for peace- 
keeping or hiding out was being put 
into effect. 

“Something I want to show 
you.” She was just barely taller 
than he, with straight black hair and 
Chinese eyes. Shortly they came out 


BIRTHDAYS 


95 



in a wide, open space, a meeting of 
corridors where, Bart saw, the kids 
had improvised a swimming pool. 
Decking had been taken up, and a 
room in the lower level flooded. 
Lotis pointed out how waterproof 
patching had been stuck in where 
necessary, and a water pipe tapped 
to fill the pool. The water looked 
deeper than a man’s head, 

Bart was impressed, but some- 
how disturbed, too, that they had 
done this much on their own. 
“Didn’t the machines do anything 
to stop you?” 

A flirt of her head dismissed the 
powers of the machines. “I’m go- 
ing in. Do you know anything about 
swimming? People on Earth used to 
do it all the time. The records show 
them doing it in the oceans even.” 

Lotis pulled off her scanty cloth- 
ing and slid naked down into the 
water. She turned over on her back 
and paddled, smiling knowingly up 
at Bart while he stared down in 
helpless fascination. Female nudity 
was not among the things on which 
his memory could give him reassur- 
ance. His mind lurched in turmoil 
this way and that. 

Suddenly he heard running feet 
quite near at hand and turned to see 
a figure dash out of a side corridor. 
Fritz was bigger and stronger even 
than a year ago, but his eyes were 
wide and frightened; he scarcely 
looked at either Bart or Lotis, but 
came running around the pool as if 
pursued. 

He was. Kichiro and Basil and 
Mai came pounding after him, car- 
rying bludgeons made of the un- 
screwed legs of chairs, their faces 
transformed in the fury of the hunt. 
Bart started to run too; he realized 

96 


almost at once this was a mistake 
but it was too late — someone, re- 
sponding to his flight with instinc- 
tive pursuit, had grabbed him from 
behind and he was flattened on the 
deck beneath his captor. 

Kichiro had tackled Bart, while 
Basil and Mai closed in on Fritz. It 
sounded like all of them .were yel- 
ling. 

Fritz broke away and fled for 
another corridor, but Basil was too 
fast and blocked his path, Fritz 
lunged at him in desperation and 
before Basil could swing his club he 
was slammed up against the bulk- 
head in a choking grip. The club 
dropped from Basil’s hand, and 
Bart, pinned on the deck under 
Kichiro’s kneeling weight, could 
see the whites of his eyes seeming 
to expand. 

Mai stepped close to the strug- 
gling pair and earnestly swing his 
plastic chair leg. The impact made 
an ugly sound and Fritz let go of 
his enemy, staggered back and fell. 

Kichiro had started to get up, and 
Bart squirmed out from beneath 
him, tore free of a grasping hand, 
and ran. His one thought was to 
reach the safety of his own room. 
He had to pass between the group 
of boys and the pool, where Lotis, 
open-mouthed, clung to the side and 
watched. 

Mai, turning wild-eyed, saw Bart 
coming and raised his club for 
another swing — 

None of them had seen the 
machine approach, but now it was 
on hand as if it had popped out of 
the many -paneled wall. It took the 
swinging club from Mai’s hand as if 
it were a feather and in the same in- 
stant shoved him violently back, so 

GALAXY 



that he stumbled over Fritz’s un- 
moving legs and fell. 

“You hurt me,” Mai croaked 
stupidly from the floor. His hand 
was scraped raw, oozing blood, 
where it had collided with the grip- 
per of the machine. 

The Ship said loudly to them all: 
“I have authority to sacrifice indi- 
viduals, if I judge it necessary for 
the good of the mission.” 

No one moved or spoke as the 
machine walked through their 
shocked silence to bend over Fritz. 
As it picked him up, Bart saw that 
his eyes were half open but unsee- 
ing, and his mouth was slack. 

It walked off down a corridor, 
carrying Fritz in its arms. His limbs 
hung down, utterly limp. The other 
boys stirred and followed, their 
weapons left behind. Bart heard a 
slosh and trickle behind him: Lotis 
getting out of the pool. He did not 
turn to look. The machine went on 
for a few score meters, then stop- 
ped, facing a panel in the wall. 

“Ship,” Kichiro said, “that’s a 
disposal chute.” But Fritz was al- 
ready gone. 

Ignored by the others, Bart ran 
back to his room and sat there, 
shivering and staring at the wall. 
The Ship served him his dinner 
without comment. He ate a little, 
and then soon turned to his bed, 
where sleep and forgetfulness never 
failed to come. 

Sixteen 

All twenty-three of the kids were 
waiting for him in the corridor 
when he stuck his head out of his 
room to see what might be going 
on. But it was all right. 

“No one’s going to try to kill 

BIRTHDAYS 


you this time,” was one of the first 
things said, by a strong young man 
with thickening patches of dark 
beard on cheek and chin. With just 
a minor effort Bart could recognize 
the speaker as Kichiro, who, as 
Bart soon found out, was this year’s 
president. They were having elec- 
tions only once a year now, he was 
soon informed. 

Fights were evidently much less 
frequent also, Bart discovered to his 
great relief. He overheard part of an 
argument as to who had tried to kill 
him last year; that was the clo- ■ 
thing to a fight that happened on 
this birthday. 

He also soon found out that 
birthdays, like gang wars, were now 
considered kid stuff, and today 
there was no party. Instead there 
was a good, elaborate lunch, with 
ice cream produced unpretentiously 
for dessert. 

Talk turned to Bart, and his pur- 
pose in the world. He repeated to 
the kids everything that the Ship 
had ever told him about that pur- 
pose, which wasn’t much. 

“I wonder,” Basil said to him, 
“what the Ship’ll do with you now? 
I mean we obviously don’t need 
you any more as a father or model 
or whatever to help us grow.” 

“I dunno,” said Bart, taking a 
little more ice cream. The kids’ 
eyes were ail sympathetic, but still 
their silent gaze made him uncom- 
fortable. “Whenever I ask Ship 
about it, it just says the mission is 
proceeding as per revised schedule, 
or something like that.” 

Sigrid nodded knowingly. 
“Ship’s that way. If it doesn’t want 
to answer something for you, it just 
won’t.”

This morning it was a relief to 
meet a group of stable, sane-looking 
people, not too much different from 
their namesakes he had said good- 
bye to the night before. 

Bart soon noticed that Basil was 
missing from the group. “Oh, he’s 
all right,” said Ora reassuringly. 
“He’ll be along for lunch. He goes 
studying the stars.” 

“The stars?” 

“We’ve found a way to reach the 
outer hull. In one place there’s a 
glass port where you can see the 
outside of the Ship, and the stars 
too, of course.” 

Bart could call up a plain picture 
of what stars were; sometime, 
somehow, he had seen them. 

“What do you think about the 
stars, Bart?” Tang asked him pa- 
tronizingly. 

He didn’t have a quick answer, 
and Arm in said: “Look, we’ve been 
working on this problem of the Ship 
and where it’s going for seventeen 
years now. And Bart’s put in how 
much time? About seventeen days.” 

And there was laughter, not un- 
kind. 


Eighteen 

When Bart mentioned that he 
thought it would be fun to learn to 
swim, they took him to the newly 
remodeled and enlarged pool. 
Everyone was matter-of-fact about 
undressing and after clothes had 
been off for a minute or two it all 
seemed practically normal to Bart. 

Resting on the pool’s edge after 
some strenuous splashing, they took 
up again last year’s discussion about 
the Ship and its purposes. Bart got 

98 


the idea that now they talked a lot 
on this subject. Today he remarked 
that maybe soon they would be hav- 
ing children, so eventually people 
would fill up the empty rooms still 
waiting on the other levels. 

Fuad shook his head. “The 
Ship’s told us we’re all sterile — 
know what that means?” 

“You can’t make any babies.” 

“That’s right. Girls and men 
both. We can do all the sex we 
want, but nothing can ever happen 
from it.” 

Later, alone, Bart asked the Ship: 
“Am I sterile too? I mean, am I go- 
ing to be, when ...” 

“No.” 

That was a definite answer at 
last, but to his old questions he still 
got only the old answers. 

Nineteen 

Bart’s chronic worry that his life 
was going fundamentally wrong was 
lightened when he met his ship- 
mates today. They were now so ob- 
viously adults that he could produce 
an inner sigh of relief and decide to 
leave the worrying to them. 

Most of the teaching machines 
had been removed. At the few re- 
maining, people were abstractedly 
at work, printouts and papers 
stacked around them. 

As soon as the word spread that 
Bart had joined them for the day, 
most of the adults abandoned other 
activities and came towering around 
him, smiling and calling greetings, 
squeezing his shoulders and ruffling 
his hair. A number of people 
wanted to show him things. 

Basil took him to see the stars. 
They went drifting, swimming 
through a part of the Ship where 

GALAXY 



gravity was turned off, and though 
there was air Basil made him wear 
a breathing device, just in case. 
Through the glass Bart looked along 
the curves of the hull, unreal in 
their great size and distances, and at 
the stars that looked even more un- 
real, like a vast bright scattering of 
powdered paint. 

After lunch he asked to go 
swimming again. Lotis, in the pool 
with him and others, now had a 
peculiar slightly mottled look to her 
thighs that Bart eventually decided 
must be caused by fat under the 
skin. And on her left thigh was the 
thread-like red tracery of an en- 
larged vein. 

After dinner Baruch and Tang 
took him aside. “Bart — do you re- 
ally like this one-day-a-year life?” 

“I dunno. It’s all right, I guess. 
The Ship must have some reason. 
It’s taking care of us all, right?” He 
might have said something else, but 
Ship heard everything. 

The men exchanged glances over 
his head. With several of the girls 
they walked him back to his room, 
when the Ship called fdr him, 
and almost tucked him into bed. 

Twenty 

He learned soon after rejoining 
the others that Tang and Ora had 
been killed, some months ago, try- 
ing to work their way into a part of 
the Ship from which humans were 
ordinarily sealed out. 

“Were they trying ... I mean, 
did it have anything to do with me? 
With waking me up more often, 
or ... ” 

'“No." Fay shook her head defi- 
nitely. “Oh no, Bart, don’t worry 
about that.” 


The thought hadn’t really worried 
him. Actually it had generated some 
hope. 

“They were trying to get to the 
far end of the Ship,” Ranjan 
explained, “You know, the aft, as 
the old records call it. Have you 
seen any of the old records? The 
part of the Ship where the drive 
controls and so many other things 
seem to be located.” 

They explained to Bart such 
elementary knowledge of the Ship 
as they had been able to piece to- 
gether, and his understanding of it 
grew a little. He found out also that 
they meant to keep on trying to get 
through to the other parts of the 
Ship, and eventually to take over its 
control. That was a strange thought, 
and Bart wasn’t at all sure how 
much he liked it. 


Twenty-one 

It had been many days since his 
shipmates paid him as little atten- 
tion as they did today. He was 
greeted cheerfully enough, but no 
crowd gathered around. A couple of 
people went with him to swim, in a 
pool that had again been remodeled 
and made safer and more pleasant. 

He learned that some of the 
people were working hard to raise 
plants from seeds the Ship had long 
ago provided for their school biol- 
ogy program. They showed him the 
new garden. It held nothing ready 
to eat yet, but maybe next time he 
came. 

He saw Kichiro limping by and 
heard that his knee had been lamed 
in some contest with another man, 
but whether it was a fight or a game 
Bart did not learn. 


BIRTHDAYS 


99 



Twenty-two 

There were no beds in the old 
common-room any more, and Bart 
found that most of the people had 
paired off two-by-two, sleeping in 
more or less stable partnerships. 

More noticeably, most of the 
people he talked to today had runny 
noses. Sharon told him that an ex- 
periment in the new biology lab had 
gone wrong and some viruses had 
escaped. Nothing to worry about, 
they assured him. He wasn’t wor- 
ried, really, not about viruses any- 
way. 

All in all, it was a casual, low- 
pressure sort of day. 


Twenty-three 

Lotis, working in the garden, 
wore shorts today, and he noticed 
that her legs and bottom were get- 
ting quite lumpy with fat. The red 
vein on her thigh had extended it- 
self into a little tracery of defective 
blood vessels in the skin. 

All the runny noses had dried up. 
Some medicine the people had 
made for themselves was ready for 
Bart in case he caught the infection 
too. He didn’t. 

“Maybe the Ship’s still taking 
good care of you,’’ Chao com- 
mented. 


Twenty-four 

No one came down the corridor 
toward his room to meet him, but 
as soon as Bart had entered the 
general living area they all jumped 
out of hiding with cries of “Sur- 
prise!” and “Happy birthday!” It 
wasn’t his birthday yet, but he soon 
understood that a sort of general 

100 


birthday had been declared in which 
he was being invited to share. 

“It’s been ten years since- we’ve 
had one, Bart,” said Himyar. “A 
party, I mean. So we just thought it 
was time.” 

“We could make you an honor- 
ary fifteen,” Fay put in. “Or how 
about an honorary twenty- four?” 
“Have a glass of wine, Bart,” 
said someone else. 

“Wine?” 

“Told you our garden was going 
to be a success.” 

“ — oh, give h[im only a small 
one! He’s too young — ” 

“ — one glass won’t hurt ’im — ” 
He realized after a while that 
some of the people were passing 
around another kind of drug, some- 
thing they sniffed up into their nos- 
trils. But he stayed with his one 
glass of wine, which made him feel 
just dizzy and high enough to be 
wary of asking for any more. 

The party went on practically all 
day, with games and jokes and 
songs. Bart no longer minded when 
people paired off and vanished for a 
while, their arms about each other. 
This behavior was grownups’ do- 
ings now, not something in which 
he might possibly become involved. 
He went along with all the partying 
and had a good time. Still, now and 
then he caught himself wishing they 
would get down to business. 
Though he didn’t know just what 
their business was. 

Twenty -five 

This year his wish seemed to 
have been granted, for he got the 
impression of a lot of serious busi- 
ness going on. People were punch- 
ing at computers and crouched over 


GALAXY 



teaching machines, and in some 
rooms devices Bart couldn’t identify 
had been set up. 

He noticed that Olen’s hairline 
was receding sharply, and wondered 
if the man had some kind of scalp 
disease. But he didn’t ask. 

In a large room away from the 
usual living area, Bart found 
Himyar working to form a towering 
metal sculpture, using a torch that 
showered and streamed electric 
flames. With this home-made de- 
vice Himyar brushed the glowing 
metal into the shapes he wanted. 
Parts of the sculpture reminded Bart 
of flowers in the garden, or, again, 
of the curves of splashed water that 
lived momentarily when someone 
dived into the pool. 

They talked for a time, and 
Himyar showed Bart some paintings 
Vivian had done. Himyar and Viv- 
ian spent most of their time working 
here or scrounging materials from 
every part of the Ship that they 
could reach; they had become 
known as the Artists. 

“And Armin’s an artist too, I 
suppose,’’ said Himyar. “He’s 
made himself a camera and goes 
around using it. Well, the Ship 
made some of the component sys- 
tems for him, and the film,” 

“I’d like to see that.” 


Twenty -six 

Nobody was working quite so 
hard today. Bart found an elaborate 
game in progress, a contest involv- 
ing both physical and mental effort, 
with complicated rules. It had to do 
with dividing up the regularly oc- 
cupied territory of the Ship between 
two contending factions or teams 

BIRTHDAYS 



who struggled to gain more territory 
from each other. People sometimes 
were allowed or compelled to 
switch sides in the game. The divid- 
ing line between the territories was 
marked with bright tapes stuck on 
the decks and bulkheads, and 
moved back and forth as people 
won or lost at events like Indian 
wrestling — men were matched 
against men, girls against girls for 
the physical struggles — or asking 
each other difficult questions. 

“Bart, be referee. Wasn’t his 
foot off the deck just then?” 

“Yep.” 

Powerful Kichiro, still limping on 
his trick knee, smiled and moved 
the tape into his opponents’ territory 
by a distance of two wall panels. 

“Hey, Bart!” It was Armin, ap- 
proaching with something in his 
hand. “You never had a chance to 
see this. Here’s a picture I took of 
you at the last birthday party. We’ll 
have to have another one of, those 
sometime.” 

Bart looked. “You hadn’t even 
started with the camera when we 
had the party. It must have been 
yesterday when you took this. I 
mean last year, for you guys.” 

“Hm. I guess you’re right.” 

Twenty-seven 

He found some of the marker 
tapes still stuck up in place, but the 
game wasn’t being played today and 
everyone seemed to have forgotten 
it. He met Fuad and Trac and was a 
little surprised to see how fat they 
both looked, with rolls of flesh 
above their shorts. 

He thought of going down the 
passageway that led to the stars 
again, but there was no breathing 

102 


equipment in the locker where Basil 
had kept it earlier. 

Baruch and Solon came along 
and asked what he was doing. They 
soon explained that the breathing 
equipment was being used in “en- 
gineering studies” to find out how 
to reach the more distant parts of 
the Ship. 

Bart wanted to know more. They 
told him of the solid walls and 
sealed doors that cut off access to 
those regions, and how the Ship re- 
fused to discuss letting anyone go 
there. It had not tried to stop their 
engineering studies, though; whether 
it would interfere when they began 
to break through a wall remained 
to be seen. 

Using explosives aboard a space- 
ship was intrinsically dangerous: 
something important and irreplace- 
able might be damaged, or a com- 
partment’s air might explode into 
vacuum. 

“That’s how Ora and Tang were 
killed. And then I was getting some 
acid ready to eat through a wall, 
and it disappeared. I suspect some 
machine found it and took it 
away.” Baruch shrugged, fatalistic 
but still determined. But we’ll see, 
we’ll see.” He did not sound or 
look at all discouraged. 

Twenty-eight 

This year Bart got more attention 
from his shipmates than had been 
usual his last few days. Edris and 
Helsa looked at his teeth and won- 
dered out loud if the Ship shouldn’t 
be straightening some of them for 
him. 

“Oh, they’re not terribly 
crooked. But it did as much for 
some of us when we were kids.” 

GALAXY 



After lunch there was a general 
discussion of his future, carried on 
at times as if he were not there. 
Ranjan said: “I still think the Ship 
plans to provide him with a bride 
one of these days, one of these 
years. Maybe it’s already tried to 
hatch other people from the artifi- 
cial wombs and something’s gone 
wrong, so it’s got poor Bart just 
marking time.” 

Another adult asked: ‘‘You still 
think there’s a good supply of hu- 
man genetic material on board?” 

‘‘Bound to be. Else the Ship 
wouldn’t have sterilized us, right?” 

There was general agreement on 
that point, but on little else. One 
body of opinion held that the Ship 
really wanted the people to take 
over, now that its own computers 
had grown crotchety and unreliable 
with breakdowns and damage. But 
some kind of glitch prevented it 
from simply saying what it wanted. 
Schizophrenic, it fended off their at- 
tempts to gain control with one 
hand, while feeding and caring for 
them with the other. 

The discussion soon got over 
Bart’s head, but he listened intently, 
trying to weigh everything they 
said. He listened for something that 
might give him confidence,' but 
heard it not. 

Twenty-nine 

“I know you’ve seen our biology 
lab before,” Galina told him. ‘‘But 
I think you ought to take a real in- 
terest. All our futures may lie in 
this room.” 

He ceased scratching his back 
against the doorframe. ‘‘How so?” 

“Sit down, Bart.” When they 
were seated, she looked at him with 

BIRTHDAYS 


concern. “Bart, if the machines 
never provide you with any people 
you own age — with a fertile female 
specifically — then it’s going to be 
up to us to find some way to even- 
tually produce more people, so that 
the human race can go on. I’m not 
sure that there are any people left 
alive on Earth.” 

“I see.” He nodded seriously. 

Galina spoke slowly and kept 
studying him for his reactions. “We 
know that when the Ship was 
launched there was a large supply 
of human sperm and ova stored on 
board, all coded as to genetic type, 
so that people could be conceived 
and raised by machines when the 
end of the voyage drew near.” 

“Uh-huh.” 

\ She sighed. “I myself suspect 
that most and perhaps nearly all of 
this genetic material was lost in 
some kind of accident that evidently 
disrupted the voyage in other ways 
as well. The Ship speaks always of 
a revised schedule for the mission, 
a revised plan.” 

“I know.” 

“There’s further evidence.” She 
paused. “I said all the human seeds 
and eggs were coded as to type and 
potential? There's some indication 
in the available records that all of 
us now alive — except you, we don’t 
know where you came from — were 
conceived from materials not consid- 
ered of the highest quality. Not 
that we have any grave genetic de- 
fects, of course, no seriously defec- 
tive material would have been 
placed aboard. But — not the best. 
This suggests to me that all the best 
material was somehow destroyed, 
and also that there may not be much 
material left.” 

103 



Bart nodded, not knowing what 
else to say or do. 

“Except you, Bart, as I said. 
There may have been a human crew 
aboard before the accident — 
whatever the accident was. You 
may be its only survivor. But I sup- 
pose your origins make little differ- 
ence. Here you are and here we are, 
and there’s the future to be faced. A 
future to be created — perhaps for 
the whole human race — out of 
whatever we have on hand. Would 
you like to learn something about 
biology?” 

“I guess I’d better,” said Bart. 

They had a pretty good first les- 
son, distinguishing plants and ani- 
mals, marking the first great 
branches of the tree of life. 

“What are those marks on your 
face?” Bart asked on impulse a few 
hours later, as they were leaving the 
lab to go to dinner. He felt he knew 
Galina pretty well now and wasn’t 
shy about getting a little more per- 
sonal. 

“What marks?” She raised tenta- 
tive fingers to her cheek. 

“Those little lines in the skin, 
going out from the corners of your 
eyes.” 

Thirty 

Today marked a standard month 
since the Ship had roused Bart from 
his first period of suspended anima- 
tion. When he awoke, a machine 
equipped with measuring devices 
was waiting at his bedside. It 
quickly got busy to check his height 
and weight, looked into his eyes 
and mouth, listened at his chest. 

“How much taller am I than a 
month ago, Ship?” 

“Approximately seventy mil- 


limeters,” said the expressionless 
voice. 

“And how much heavier?” 

“Approximately ninety-five 
grams.” 

“Is that good?” 

It wouldn’t say. But it did adjust 
his diet, adding a delicious, creamy 
drink to that very breakfast, served 
in his room. 

When he joined the other people 
he found Olen half bald, and 
learned that Basil had gone back to 
communing with the stars. 

Galina gave him another biology 
lesson, more technical and duller 
than the first.* 

Thirty-one 

Today Bart heard that Dierdre 
was in her bed, too sick to get up. 

“She always liked you, Bart,” 
said Chao sadly. “Go in and talk to 
her a little.” 

He went into Deirdre’s room, and 
found her looking much sicker than 
any human being he had ever seen 
before. She also seemed too dazed 
to talk very much. 

“Galina’s been giving her 
drugs,” Chao explained when he 
came out. “Otherwise the pain gets 
too bad.” 

“Pain? From what?” 

“They think it’s cancer.” Chao 
and others tried to explain. 

Only later did they get around to 
telling him that Baruch had been 
killed in some kind of an explosion, 
trying to force a passage to the for- 
bidden areas of the Ship. 

“Remember this photograph, 
Bart?” said Armin, cheering him 
up. “I took it of you at our last 
birthday party. We’re going to have 
another one soon.” 


104 


GALAXY 



“You took it the year after the 
birthday party, Armin.’’ 

“Oh? Maybe you’re right.” 

Galina was busy with her other 
work today and never got around to 
teaching him biology. 

Thirty-two 

Deirdre had died, which came as 
no surprise to Bart but still left him 
with a hollow feeling. Thinking 
over matters of life and death, he 
stood at the edge of the garden, a 
high-domed region full of bright 
lights, vastly enlarged from the first 
little plot of synthetic soil. People 
were jogging for exercise around 
the walk that circled the perimeter 
of the garden, while others were 
working casually inside. 

It was strange to see gray in the 
hair of some of them, but Bart 
guessed that was just one more 
thing that happened naturally with 
age. His own hair, crewcut when 
his shipmates were babies, was 
starting to fall over his forehead 
now. 

He went to look up Basil, and 
asked to go out and see the stars 
again. Basil was willing. When they 
got to the observation port, he 
pointed out to Bart the prow of the 
Ship, and the aft, or the stern as 
they sometimes called it, where the 
engines and their controls were sup- 
posed to be. 

“And when some people finally 
get back there,” Bart asked, 
“they’ll really be able to take over 
the whole thing?” 

Basil shrugged. He was looking 
mainly outward, at the stars.

Bart as he came down the corridor 
from his room, and as soon as she 
smiled in greeting he noticed that 
several teeth were missing from her 
lower jaw. 

“Had a jaw cyst, Bart. At least 
that’s what Galina and Solon say. 
They took it out. Spoils my famous 
beauty, but they think eventually 
they’ll be able to do something 
about giving me artificial teeth.” 
“Couldn’t the Ship—?” 

“It wouldn’t help, whether it 
could or not. It’s giving us less and 
less help these days. But never 
mind about that, come along, we've 
got something to show you.” 

He followed along. And then 
they were all jumping out at him, 
yelling surprise! Birthday party! The 
common dining room was decorated 
with streamers and balloons, and 
the table set for a feast. 

“We were going to have one 
next year, Bart, you know, ten 
years from the last, but then we de- 
cided why not have it now?” 

“You can be whatever age you 
like, Bart. Be an honorary thirty- 
three with us, if you like.” 

“That’s a third of a century, 
Mai,” a woman cried. “Who wants 
to be that old?” 

They were all good to him, as 
they usually were these days, pet- 
ting and hugging him and fussing 
around, making it his party although 
it was supposed to be their birthday 
and he never said what honorary 
age he wanted. Actually he didn’t 
want any, his own real age was 
good enough. 

Later he found unnoticed in a 
corner something that he supposed 
had been dragged out of storage ac- 
cidentally with the decorations. It 

106 


was a wheeled plastic toy that he 
remembered fixing for Deirdre a 
month ago. 

Thirty-four 

The marking tapes were up on 
the bulkheads again, and a few 
people were playing at the 
question-and-wrestle game. Mean- 
while some had evidently been 
spending a lot of time working in 
the garden. It was now huge, and 
looked like the earthly gardens pic- 
tured in the Ship’s records, which 
none of them Had ever seen in actu- 
ality. 

“And now, Bart, we’re going to 
have some prayers. Come along.” 

“Some what?” 

“You’ll see. It’s another old idea 
that Basil’s been putting into prac- 
tice lately.” 

They had wanted to hold the 
prayer meetings out by the observa- 
tion port, Bart learned, but there 
wasn’t room enough for everyone, 
and all had wanted to attend the 
first meetings at least, to see what 
they were going to be like. That 
was a month or two ago and by 
now attendance was dropping slight- 
ly. 

Bart didn’t understand the theory 
of prayer too well, but at the meet- 
ing Basil and the others who got up 
to talk seemed to be speaking not 
only to the Ship but to the world 
outside it, and to some force or 
power that had made them both. 

Thirty-five 

When Bart emerged from his 
room most of his shipmates were 
there in the hall waiting for him, 
something that hadn’t happened 
since they were sixteen, a day he 

GALAXY 



could remember well. Today they 
were going to bring him to a meet- 
ing, they said, and at first Bart ex- 
pected more prayers, but this meet- 
ing turned out to be more business- 
like than that. 

It was governmental council, held 
all day or most of the day around 
the big table with lunch coming as 
an interruption. Lunch included 
fruits and vegetables brought fresh 
from the garden, as well as the 
usual rations issued by the Ship. 

The proceedings got rather boring 
for Bart, though his friends made an 
effort to bring him into it all. They 
showed him their new system of 
recordkeeping, of recording all the 
discoveries of their research for 
easy access by Bart and future gen- 
erations. 

He looked the question at them. 

“It’s true, Bart,’’ said Fay. A 
deep, gentle happiness glowed 
through her eyes at the thought. 
“The Ship has recently promised 
us, there will be future generations.” 

“Provided the mission is com- 
pleted,” someone put in. 

“Yes. Well.” That 'was enough 
for Fay, and for the people as a 
group. 

Bart himself thought it sounded 
fine, but he would still like to know 
more. He asked the Ship for details 
later but got nowhere, as usual. 


Thirty-six 

There had been important 
changes made around him. He knew 
this the moment he started to come 
out of sleep. Opening his eyes a 
groggy second or two later, he 
realized that he was in a new bed- 


room, much like his old one but 
different in detail and bigger. 

“Ship . Ship, where am I? 
What’s happened?” 

“You have been moved during 
your sleep into a new accommoda- 
tion, Bart. There is no cause for 
alarm.” 

He got up and dressed and ate 
and eliminated as usual. The walls 
of this room were metal, and its 
door was thicker, as he saw when it 
opened for him to go out. 

“Why did you move me, Ship?” 

“Some of the people were at- 
tempting to reach you, to rouse you 
from sleep at the wrong time. They 
meant well but it was necessary to 
prevent their interference.” 

His door opened into a corridor 
he had never seen before, leading 
off in one direction only. It bent 
sharply several times and was inter- 
rupted by two sets of heavy doors 
that opened as Bart drew near and 
closed immediately after he had 
passed. 

He found himself coming back 
into the peopled area of the Ship 
from a new direction, near the biol- 
ogy lab. The first folk to see him 
dropped what they were doing and 
ran to give him a glad welcome. 

“I told you he’d be* here on 
schedule!” cried Mai, pounding 
Bart joyfully on the back. No club 
in Mai’s hand this time. 

“Ship was just taking good care 
of him, that’s all!” Sigrid pulled 
him in for a big hug against her 
heavy bosom. 

Later he learned that an intensive 
effort had been made to “rescue” 
him from the machines, set him free 
from his long sleeps. The attempt 
had collapsed, foolishly, and no one 


BIRTHDAYS 


107 



wanted to talk about it. Then 
everyone had grown a little worried 
about Bart and all were glad to see 
him still coming back, if only for a 
day each year. 

Gray was spreading in the hair of 
the happy crew around him, and 
several of the male heads were 
nearly bald. Many of the people 
looked a little fatter and squintier 
than when he had seen them last. 
They gave him a big lunch that was 
almost a birthday party. 

Thirty-seven 

Galina and Solon took him on a 
tour of their biology lab, which was 
much enlarged and changed since 
he had seen it last, with cages holding 
white rats and hamsters, raised from 
genetic material obtained from the 
Ship’s stores. 

“Do you think the long sleeps 
are harming me?’’ Bart asked when 
he had a chance. 

“Harming you physically? No, I 
doubt it.’’ Galina looked at him 
thoughtfully. “It takes an enormous 
amount of energy and a great deal 
of control equipment to keep a hu- 
man being in such a sleep; even a 
Ship like this couldn’t do it for very 
many people at a time. It’s not just 
freezing in the ordinary sense, you 
know. Even the orbital electrons 
within your body’s atoms are kept 
from moving ... but don’t worry 
about the physical danger of it, 
that’s extremely small.” 

She was anxious to resume the 
biology lessons, and they went on a 
thorough tour of the lab. 

“We haven’t been able to get any 
human genetic material from the 
Ship to work with. Still, in theory it 
should be possible for us to produce 

108 


a new human generation here, start- 
ing with just ordinary cells from our 
own bodies. Did I ever tell you any- 
thing about cloning cells?” 

“No.” 

“I will. Anyway, it hasn’t 
worked out yet. We’re not sure if 
the Ship is interfering in some sub- 
tle way, or if there are simply prob- 
lems we’re not aware of.” 

They showed Bart masses of tis- 
sue growing in glass jars. But they 
had never been able to get the tissue 
to differentiate properly into all the 
organs that hacf to grow in concert 
to make a person. It looked to Bart 
as if they hadn’t yet even come 
close to achieving that. 

Here and there old colored tapes 
were stuck to the walls and over- 
head, but the game they represented 
seemed to have been utterly aban- 
doned. 

The only competition Bart heard 
about today was in raising the best 
food plants and flowers. 

Thirty-eight 

It was depressing to see Helsa 
now dragging herself around like an 
invalid, her arms grown thin and 
her ankles puffy. Others told Bart 
that Galina suspected some slow, 
incurable disease. Then they turned 
the talk to brighter things. 

“There’s a lot of card playing go- 
ing on now, Bart,” Sharon in- 
formed him. 

“Card playing?” 

“Poker, whist, bridge,” said 
Ranjan. “We’ll show you. They’re 
old games we dug out of the Ship’s 
records. Then we’ve also tried two 
pew ways to get through the bar- 
riers to reach the control regions of 
the Ship, but neither has worked.” 

GALAXY 



“We haven’t really tried them 
yet,” Fuad objected. 

“Well, we’ve run them on the 
computer,” Lotis put in. 

“Bah. I tell you, the Ship is still 
using that computer against us — ” 

“No, / keep telling you," argued 
Ranjan, “we’ve got it blocked off 
now against any possibility of the 
Ship’s gaining access — ” 

“So you think! I don’t agree.” 
The argument was heated, but still 
showed no sign of coming to blows. 

Thirty-nine 

Today there was a prayer meet- 
ing, more elaborate in ceremony but 
less intense in feeling that the last 
one Bart had attended. He noted 
that people’s clothing, which they 
now made largely for themselves, 
was growing more elaborate too, 
and more voluminous; it covered 
more of their sagging bodies, and 
distracted attention from them. 

Bart also noticed that a softer, 
more comfortable type of chair had 
been manufactured somehow and 
was now in general use. The legs 
didn’t look as if they could be un- 
screwed. 

Forty 

It was birthday party time again. 
Only four candles adorned the big 
cake; each standing for ten years, as 
someone explained to Bart. The 
party was opened with a rather per- 
functory prayer. 

“Bet you don’t remember when I 
took this picture of you, Bart.” 

“Yes I do.” 

Several speeches were made, 
tracing the recent history of prog- 
ress in science — mainly astronomi- 
cal observations and biological 

birthdays 


research — and in the arts, mainly 
sculpture, painting, and drawing. 
Not much had been done lately in 
an engineering way, a speaker said, 
which Bart supposed meant they 
weren’t getting anywhere with plans 
to take over the Ship. 

A new president, Olen, had just 
been elected for a two-year term, 
and he pledged in a vague way to 
get things moving. 

All around the table the faces 
were puffy or lined, continuing to 
puddle or sag. There was more gray 
hair than any other color. 

Forty-one 

Bart found a number of people 
playing chess, a game they said 
they would teach him before the 
day was over. 

About dinner time Basil told him 
something else, more confidentially. 
“I’m not going to give you any de- 
tails, kid, nothing the Ship doesn’t 
already know. Information you 
don’t have can’t be pumped out of 
you. I’ll just say that this time we 
really know what we’re doing, and 
we’re not likely to be stopped. 
We’ve been a long time getting 
ready.” 

Forty -two 

He soon learned that Basil, Mai, 
and Olen had set out, shortly after 
Bart’s last waking day, on a major 
effort to force their way into the 
Ship’s control areas. They were not 
back yet, and by now it was doubt- 
ful, to say the least, that they ever 
would return. 

Himyar, the sculptor, proudly 
showed Bart a tall pair of steel 
doors on which he was carving the 
history of their little society in a 

109 



series of panels. He claimed that he 
had devised a method of grinding 
stainless steel that worked beautiful- 
ly- 

Helsa was now much better, Bart 
saw with some surprise. But Sigrid 
looked unhealthy and was complain- 
ing of vague pains. “We’re going 
to try something new,” Bart heard 
Galina tell her cheerfully. Evidently 
the Ship was again not helping, or 
could not. 

The garden had once more been 
enlarged, the entire new area being 
used for additional food plants. 

Forty-three 

Basil was back, had been back 
for several months, but Bart saw 
that there was still something new 
and wild and strange in his eyes and 
he was still emaciated. The other 
men weren’t coming back, Basil 
said, and that was about all he had 
to tell about his great adventure. 

The way Basil looked made Bart 
timid about pressing him with any 
further questions. Later he heard 
more of Basil’s story from someone 
else. The three men had tried going 
out into space, outside the Ship, to 
reach the aft where they intended to 
get back in. Something had gone 
wrong with their equipment; maybe 
the Ship had sabotaged it. They did 
get back into the Ship, luckily in a 
region where they could find air and 
water and stored food enough to 
keep them alive for a time, but the 
controls had been as much out of 
reach as ever. Eventually Basil had 
made his way back, somehow, 
through a maze of inner decks and 
passageways. He had never made it 
completely clear just how the other 
two had died, and Bart got the im- 

110 


pression that it might be wise not to 
press too closely on that question. 

Himyar had completed his doors 
and was working with Vivian on a 
giant mural of Earth, composed of 
scenes reconstructed imaginatively 
from old records. 

Sigrid’s condition was not much 
changed from last year. 

Fay, having recently been named 
president in a special election, told 
Bart it had been decided that he 
should attend school every waking 
day. The people were getting ready 
a course of 'study for him. “The 
machines insisted on our attending 
school, I mean in a formal way, 
and I don’t know why they don’t 
with you, but never mind.” She 
brushed back her graying hair and 
looked at him as if at a challenge. 
“It’s time and past time that you 
formed good habits to carry you 
through the rest of your life.” 

Forty-four 

Bart heard right away that Sigrid 
had died, only a few days ago. 

Maybe this latest death was still 
on everyone’s mind, and that was 
why his first day of school didn’t 
go too well. Lotis was teaching, 
and sort of skipped from subject to 
subject, and technique to technique. 
She knew it wasn’t going well, and 
once she sighed: “Someone else 
will take a turn at teaching next 
year, I mean tomorrow. Are you 
able to learn anything from me, 
Bart?” 

“Oh yes.” 

His day was almost over before 
he heard something exciting: it .was 
no longer quite certain that Olen 
and Mai were dead. At least some 
garbled message had come in, along 

GALAXY 



disused intercom channels that were 
thought to connect with control ter- 
ritory. Some almost indecipherable 
words about surviving. Maybe it 
was only garbage belched out by 
the vast intraship communications 
delay lines or memory drums, 
maybe not produced by any of this 
generations’s people at all. But 
maybe . 


Forty-five 

Himyar had put his clever hands 
to work, toiling in his improved 
shop, to outfit several people with 
eyeglasses. Studies on artificial 
teeth were now well under way, 
with Solon doing most of the re- 
search. The Ship refused to do any- 
thing along prosthetic lines for any- 
one, though it still treated routine 
minor injuries. 

Bart heard Edris and Trac and 
Kichiro praying, but no longer to 
the Ship. He saw Basil, who now 
stared at walls instead of stars, and 
still said very little. 

School was better today. Fuad as 
teacher talked with him easily and 
amused him with stories of old 
Earth. 

Forty-six 

School again, his teacher Chao, 
who was grimly determined that he 
should learn to appreciate the 
beauties of geometry. 

He heard that the garden was just 
getting over an epidemic of plant 
disease, caused by no one knew 
what. 

Ranjan had just been elected pres- 
ident, for an indeterminate term, 
and had pledged to get things mov- 
ing. 

The work on artificial teeth was

progressing again after several set- 
backs. Solon and others looked into 
Bart’s mouth again to judge whether 
he needed braces, but to his relief 
decided to let well enough, or al- 
most well enough, alone. 

Forty-seven 

Bart got to see Vivian’s and 
Himyar’s finished mural, and part 
of a championship chess game be- 
tween Annin and Basil. 

He tasted a new hybrid fruit from 
the restored garden. 

He heard vague mention of a 
Golden Birthday celebration that 
might last for a year and should be- 
gin fairly soon. 

He saw some artificial teeth in 
operation. 

He heard with blunted shock that 
Fay, who had been working on and

111 


off in the biology lab, had killed 
herself with quick painless poison. 
If anyone knew the reasons, they 
never made them plain to Bart. 

In school Himyar taught him, 
spiritedly but unintelligibly, about 
the various traditions of Earthly art. 

Forty-eight 

The gardeners and biologists had 
reported success in rejuvenating 
plants, and there was hope of apply- 
ing their discoveries to people. 
Some were saying excitedly that 
now they understood why the Ship 
in its wisdom had refused them any 
help along this line, while letting 
them work freely at it for them- 
selves. It was beyond the very 
limited creative capabilities of com- 
puters; only humans could do it. 

Not everyone agreed. 

Bart’s school went on with a 
whole group of teachers. They were 
trying music appreciation today, and 
no one on the Ship seemed to have 
a real bent in this direction. 

Forty-nine 

Bart noticed today that some of 
the people who had seemed happily 
and permanently paired off as sex- 
and-life partners were now paired 
off in different pairings, and evi- 
dently just as happy. 

Today in school there was some 
confusion about just what Bart had 
been taught in previous sessions, 
and what he might now be fairly 
tested on. He did well on the tests 
when they were finally given, and 
the arguing teachers were all re- 
lieved. 

Fifty 

Again the whole group — the fif- 
112 


teen still alive — was on hand to 
greet Bart when he came through 
the last heavy door that set aside his 
private territory. They greeted him 
with cheers and songs, told him to- 
day was a holiday from school, and 
pulled him away for what they 
promised would be the biggest and 
best birthday party yet. 

Sharon had just been elected pres- 
ident, and at the party table made a 
brief speech about how, with the 
help of all of them, she meant to 
get things moving again. As she 
said, she certainly wasn’t going to 
be able to do it all by herself. 

There were several games of vol- 
leyball. Playing with these old 
people who had the names of kids 
he had once briefly met, Bart found 
himself for a little while one of the 
gang. He lost himself in the game, 
jumped nimbly among the jiggling 
paunches and creaking joints, got 
knocked down when someone’s 
hundred-kilo mass accidentally 
crashed into him. 

But it was only for a little while 
that he belonged. 

Fifty-one 

He came into their living area 
with the feeling that they would 
have forgotten about keeping him in 
school, but no, the lessons were on 
as promised. Today, with Helsa 
teaching, Bart got a basic course in 
the Ship, what little the old records 
actually said about it and its mis- 
sion, and something of what the 
people had been able to find out for 
themselves. After lunch, somewhat 
to Bart’s surprise, Basil came in 
and took over for a while, describ- 
ing how the hull looked from out- 
side, and what some of the remoter 


GALAXY 



portions of the Ship were tike. He 
spoke impersonally, and rarely as if 
he himself had been there. 

Fifty -two 

The whole company was in a 
state of extreme excitement. About 
a month ago the world of the Ship 
had been rocked by an explosion, 
thought to have taken place a 
kilometer or two away along the 
hull, probably toward the aft. 
Whether a hurtling meteoric body 
had struck the hull, or there was 
some internal cause, was unknown. 

The rumor flew by that Mai and 
Olen were perhaps still alive, and 
somehow responsible for the blast. 

There was a sudden renewal of 
religious fervor. School was con- 
ducted in an atmosphere of tension. 

Fifty-three 

There had been no more explo- 
sions, nor any further hints that the 
lost men had survived. The crisis 
atmosphere was gone, and talk was 
again centered on the hoped-for re- 
juvenation treatments. 

Bart saw a proud display of im- 
planted artificial teeth. The method 
didn’t work well in all cases yet but 
Solon was optimistic about im- 
provements. 

School went on. Today a team of 
instructors tried to teach him a little 
about human language and its near- 
infinite variations, some of which 
they spoke, or at least could read. 

Fifty-four 

Timber harvested from the 
enormous garden was being used to 
build a sort of pavilion, a roofless, 
high-walled structure which Bart 
was told would be used as a kind of 


social center. He thought they built 
it just to be building something. 

Himyar was seeking treatment for 
arthritis, which had stiffened his 
fingers and interefered considerably, 
with his work. 

Fifty -five 

Fuad lay on a bed inside the 
finished pavilion, recuperating from 
what he said had been a heart at- 
tack. Galina said the ECG showed 
that the worst was over. Bart sat 
and talked for a while with Fuad, 
who was fatter even than last ye. r, 
and didn’t look good. 

People were swinging woven rac- 
quets, worn with use, in a game 
they called squash, played where 
the volleyball net had been three 
days ago. 


Fifty-six 

“What I preach to you, Bart,” 
said Basil, taking a turn at being 
schoolmaster, “what we have 
evolved here in our little world, is a 
complete synthesis of all mankind’s 
old creeds and philosophies. I am 
really certain of this.” 

“How can you have a complete 
watchamacallit if they were always 
contradicting each other, like you 
say?” 

Basil had a long answer, but Bart 
found it not very satisfying. 

A large part of the garden was 
now taken up by plants grown sole- 
ly for use in the rejuvenation exper- 
iments. 

Bart heard at dinner that Chao 
was now suffering repeated bouts of 
mental illness, and Galina had to 
keep her tranquilized and sometimes 
confined to her own room. 


BIRTHDAYS 


113 



Fifty-seven 

Politics had heated up suddenly. 
Edris, who had been acting presi- 
dent, had been removed from office 
and, as some kind of compromise 
Trac was in. Bart couldn’t figure 
out what the dispute was about, ex- 
cept some of the people felt them- 
selves insulted by others. 

At lunch Trac made a little 
speech about how she meant to get 
things moving again, both on explo- 
ration of the Ship and the rejuvena- 
tion work, which evidently had 
been allowed to lapse. She said also 
that expanded medical facilities 
were needed, and the hospital 
should be enlarged. 

Bart remembered the hospital as 
the pavilion or social center, but 
there were two chronic invalids, 
Fuad and Chao, living in it now. 


Fifty-eight 

Kichiro and Himyar were pointed 
out to Bart as rejuvenation patients, 
perhaps already on their way to 
growing younger, though Galina 
and Solon didn’t want to make any 
definite claims just yet. 

“It’s helped me a great deal, 
too,” Trac said. Bart thought to 
himself how much her face had 
wrinkled and bagged in the last few 
days. 

Himyar had started working in a 
new electronic medium, less de- 
manding on the knuckles. 

Basil was living apart now, giv- 
ing much time to fasting and 
prayer. 

Most of the women had taken to 
dyeing their hair, yellow and red 
being favorite colors. 


Fifty-nine 

Great interest in chess had re- 
vived, and a huge birthday party 
was being planned for next year. 

Hair colors were still used, but 
had been toned down. 

School went on, Bart arguing 
with his teachers that they should 
show him more about the structure 
of the Ship than about things of old 
Earth that didn’t seem to him to 
have any bearing on his present 
situation. Gating still pushed biolo- 
gy, but Bart could see that you’d 
have to study that for years to really 
get anywhere. He didn’t know how 
much time he had to study any- 
thing. 

A couple of small riding carts 
had been built, powered by electric 
motors, and Bart had some fun rid- 
ing them about. His elders got an- 
gry and yelled at him when he 
drove too wildly. 

The most popular physical game 
consisted of sliding plastic discs 
over a pattern of numbered squares 
on the floor. 


Sixty 

When he woke up in his room a 
machine was standing beside him, 
waiting; to give him his monthly 
physical. His gains in weight and 
height were both greater than at any 
time during the previous month. He 
counted a few more pubic hairs. 
This morning the creamy drink was 
dropped from his solitary breakfast. 

The birthday party had more and 
fancier decorations than before, but 
little else was different, except that 
most of the people were content to 
just sit around and eat and drink 
and talk. Fuad didn’t eat or drink 


114 


GALAXY 



much — he’d lost a lot of weight, 
gut Chao, as the others said, was 
having a good day, and joined in 
merrily. 

All in all, the old people had a 
good time. They fussed over Bart 
quite a bit, but he felt pretty much 
out of it. Not sad, really, but de- 
tached. School had been recessed 
for the day, though he would have 
liked to learn more about the Ship. 

Sixty-one 

Ranjan had suffered a stroke, and 
was lying paralyzed in the hospital, 
unable to move anything on his 
right side. Everyone seemed angry 
at the Ship, for what they described 
as cutting back more on its medical 
programs just as their needs were 
rising. Part of the space it had for- 
merly used to give them such nig- 
gardly medical treatments as it pro- 
vided had now been walled off. 
Something else was going on in 
there, they said, and nodded angri- 
ly, though they didn’t know what 
was going on. 

They questioned Bart, something 
like envy now mixed on their faces 
with the tenderness they usually ac- 
corded him these days. But he had 
not a scrap of information to pro- 
vide. 

At the moment the office of pres- 
ident was empty, and the question 
°f reorganizing the government was 
being somewhat crankily debated. 

Sixty-two 

Vivian, who had been getting fat, 
w as wasting and suffering internal 
Pains. Ranjan was still unable to 
Pelp himself at all. Bart was told 
( hese ills and a catalogue of lesser 
°nes as if he should be just bursting 

6| RTHDAYS 


with eagerness to hear them. 

He was more interested in ping- 
pong, which was now a favorite 
game. 

The burning social question was 
whether there should be an attempt 
at tinkering with the basic food 
machines to try to get a more easily 
chewable output from them. 

Kichiro, Solon, and Armin, the 
only really healthy men, were un- 
dertaking an ambitious program to 
get themselves in shape. Edris, 
Galina, Sharon, Helsa, and Lotis 
were laughing a lot at the men and 
pondering a reducing program for 
themselves. Trac was thin already, 
maybe because she had trouble eat- 
ing. 

Sixty-three 

He learned that Vivian was dead, 
to nobody’s surprise. 

His school today was conducted 
by Lotis, who about seven weeks 
ago had started to seduce him in the 
swimming pool. Meeting the eyes 
of the old gray-haired woman now, 
Bart thought she didn’t remember 
that at all, which was only right; 
that hadn’t been her in the pool at 
all, only someone with whom she 
shared a name. Today she taught 
him gardening. 

The garden was being expanded 
again. A lot of the rejuvenation 
plants were still there, taking up 
space, and not so much living room 
was needed for people any more, 
Bart supposed. There were fourteen 
of them alive now instead of 
twenty-four, and the survivors 
didn’t move around as much as they 
used to. 

“Remember when 1 took this pic- 
ture of you, Bart?” 

115 



“Yes I do, but you don’t.” And 
he went rudely on his way, leaving 
Armin standing still behind him. It 
wasn’t really Armin that bothered 
Bart, it was the whole situation. 
The future wasn’t coming for these 
old people, but it was sure enough 
coming for him. 

Sixty-four 

Fuad had just died, of another 
heart attack, and Bart was solemnly 
conducted to see the still body be- 
ing stored in a refrigeration room 
before they said words over it and 
gave it back to the Ship through a 
disposal chute. 

“Death is a part of life, Bart,” 
Basil explained. They hadn’t given 
him that reasonable an explanation a 
couple of months ago when they 
murdered Fritz before his eyes. 
Never mind, he told himself. 

The more energetic people were 
playing squash today, and Bart 
joined in for a little while. He was 
fussed over as usual, and after 
school people pressed cake and 
cookies on him. 

Sixty-five 

He had noticed for some time 
that his sessions in the school room 
(not far from the hospital, from 
which came now and then a queru- 
lous groaning) tended to fall into 
two types. In the first type a teacher 
tried very earnestly to cram knowl- 
edge into his head; in a lesson of 
the second type (sometimes con- 
ducted by the same man or woman) 
there were long pauses, and an air 
of futility hung over the proceed- 
ings. 

Today’s session, starting right af- 
ter lunch, was of the second type. 

116 


After about an hour Sharon, his in- 
structor, left him alone with a teach- 
ing machine, from which he 
abstracted information on the layout 
of the Ship, until that got boring. 
He played with the machine trivially 
then until they came to get him for 
dinner. 

Sixty- six 

He asked to be allowed to study 
on his own again, and when the re- 
quest was granted he daydreamed 
and played With the machine for a 
while. The vision of young Lotis in 
the pool came to him, and he got 
up and went to see if the pool was 
still there. 

Gray-haired Lotis, his teacher 
again today, discovered his un- 
explained desertion and came after 
him angrily. They quarreled, and 
she tried to take him by the hair and 
drag him back to school. 

She was still a sturdy old girl, 
but in getting free he pushed her 
hard enough to knock her down. 
Alarmed by the way she yelled, he 
ran away. 

Soon Kichiro came limping after 
him. Bart might have run some 
more and evaded capture, or sought 
the safety of his room, but he thrust 
out his lip and stood his ground. 
Kichiro slapped him and overawed 
him and made him come back to 
school, the hardest grip that Bart 
could remember clamped on his 
arm. 

Sixty-seven 

He heard that Ranjan had died, to 
everyone’s relief, after six years of 
paralysis. 

Bart went sullenly into school- 
under Kichiro’s watchful eye. 

galaxy 




The regular lesson hadn’t gone 
far before Kichiro interrupted it to 
make a small impulsive speech. 
“Bart, you’re about all that we old 
people have to live for. You and the 
hope that you represent, that one 
day there will be more people on 
the Ship, people who will get out 
from under the yoke of the 
machines, something we’ve never 
been able to manage. ‘We have 
done those things we ought not to 
have done, and left undone those 
things we should have done.’ ” 

Bart didn’t know what to say. 

“But all our lives make too much 
of a burden to be put on you, don’t 
they?” Kichiro added with a sigh. 
He seemed to be pleading. 

“No, it’s all right with me if you 
feel that way.” 

And his teacher was happy and 
gave him a manly hug. But Kichiro 

BIRTHDAYS 


had missed the point. Bart no 
longer cared how any of them felt 
about anything. 

Sixty-eight 

The first person he met was Ar- 
min, who told him that Chao and 
Basil had both died, separately and 
rather suddenly, in the past year. 

Bart went to school and found 
that they had a test programmed 
into the teaching machine, ready for 
him to take. Left alone to work, he 
answered a couple of the questions, 
and then, feeling that he had some- 
thing more important to do on this 
day, he got up and left the school. 
He looked back once and then 
walked on. Kichiro looked older 
and less vigorous than he had two 
years before, and Bart didn’t think 
any of the others would try to get 
rough with him. Not any more. 



He went to the commissary and 
punched orders for a small birthday 
cake into the machine, as he had 
done for some of those early par- 
ties, so long ago. It seemed long to 
him, now. 

Soon he had his cake, and the 
fourteen small candles he had or- 
dered, and a lighter too. He carried 
the cake to a refectory table and sat 
down alone to eat some of it him- 
self. He made a little ceremony of 
lighting the candles, but would have 
felt too silly singing himself any 
songs. 

He had ordered the sweet fizzy 
drink he usually had at parties but 
soon got up and went to where the 
wine was always kept and poured 
himself a cup of that. 

Kichiro came in and stared at him 
a few moments before speaking. 
“You’re supposed to be in school.” 
The old man’s voice was half star- 
tled and half angry. “What do you 
think you’re doing?” 

“It’s my fourteenth birthday to- 
day. I’m having my cake.” 

Kichiro stared a little longer 
through his puffy, old man’s eyes. 
“Well — I’m sorry if we forgot 
about your birthday, but that doesn’t 
excuse your running out in the mid- 
dle of a test.” He had left a door 
open somewhere behind him and all 
the time he was talking, fretful 
moaning complaints kept drifting 
from the direction of the hospital. 

Armin and Helsa came into the 
room. “What’s the matter?” 

Kichiro told them, and they 
started arguing, Helsa for taking a 
different approach with the boy, as 
she put it, and Armin in favor of 
declaring another holiday. This last 
suggestion angered Kichiro. They 


were still arguing with one another 
when Bart finished the little piece 
of cake on his plate and got up and 
left, practically unnoticed. This time 
he located the pool but found it had 
long been dry and empty. 

Sixty-nine 

Bart woke up and left his room 
as usual, and was surprised when 
the first set of heavy doors that in- 
terrupted his private corridor re- 
mained closed when he approached. 
Then he saw that a new doorway, 
leading to a new, or newly re- 
vealed, passageway had been made 
in the wall at right angles to the 
doors. 

After a moment, Bart took the 
new way. 

“The prime directives under 
which I operate are very clear,” the 
Ship said in his ear. “At least one 
human parent is necessary for chil- 
dren to mature to their full poten- 
tial. 

“We will arrive in less than 
twenty standard years within a sys- 
tem of planets probably suitable for 
colonization. From now on you will 
be awakened increasingly often. 
You will serve the first generation 
of colonists as parent. Like them, 
you have first-rate genetic potential, 
and perhaps you will remain in 
some position of leadership when 
they mature. Today begins your ap- 
prenticeship in this role; your 
elementary preparation for it, a 
course in the basics of human 
psychology, was completed yester- 
day.” 

With gradual comprehension Bart 
walked on, guided toward the new 
nursery by the polyphonic squalling 
from its full cribs. ★

Alter Ego, you will give me that 
paper or I will bum — yes, burn — 
every one of your collection of used 
synapses. Even those few precious 
blue-spark sex impulses you’ve 
been hoarding. 

“Oh, Geis. .Are there no depths 
to which you will not plunge to get

brutal, so merciless, so ruthless — ” 

Yes! I am! Hand me that list! 

“Alright, here. There’s nothing 
worse than a Prime Ego when it 
smells a big slab of raw ego-boo. 
Yes. yes, look at you. Eyes all lit 
up, nostrils flaring, that terrible 
grimace of triumphant glee, the

I WON! BOTH OF THEM! 

“Ha! I knew you’d say it that 

119 


way. When will you ever admit that 
we win these awards? Without me, 
Geis, you’d be reduced to writing 
pleading notes to your creditors ask- 
ing for more time.” 

Alter, your insults roll off me 
like common sense rolls off liberal 
politicians. Nothing can bring me 
down today. Wow. ‘Best Fanzine: 
The Alien Critic.’ ‘Best Fan 
Writer: Richard E. Geis.’ 

“Okay, now you’ve blared it to 
the world. Do you want to comment 
on the other Hugo winners for 1974 
which were given at the 33rd World 
Science Fiction Convention at Mel- 
bourne, Australia in late August, 
1975?” 

Of course. The lesser categories 
do deserve mention. 

*Choke* 

But first a few words of comment 
about the ballot counting procedures 
and their results. Susan Wood in 
Locus #179* reports that approx- 
imately 600 final ballots were cast. 
Since total registration for the con- 
vention was over 2000, this means 
that, as usual, only those who felt 
themselves qualified and those in- 
terested actually sent in their 
marked final ballots. 

The system used to determine the 
winner works like this: 

The voters mark their choices 
on the ballot: First, Second, Third, 
Fourth, Fifth. 

If none of the nominees in a 


*Box3938,SanFrancisco,CA941 19. 
15 for $6.00 in U.S.A. 


given category has an absolute 
majority of first place votes, the 
nominee with the least first place 
votes is eliminated and the second 
place nominees on those ballots are 
awarded those votes as first place 
votes. 

If there is still not a majority 
winner, the next nominee with the 
least first place votes is eliminated 
and the second place votes on those 
ballots are assigned as first place 
votes to the remaining three 
nominees. 

And so it goes until there is a 
majority winner. 

I cannot remember when ar 
Worldcon convention committee his 
released information on the number 
of elimination rounds required in 
each category. 

Once in a while a committee will 
announce second and third place in 
the final balloting, and sometimes 
the number of votes each of the 
leading three nominees ended with. 

But not this time. The Aussiecon 
committee felt, to quote Susan, ‘the 
honor of nomination should be left 
without ranking.’ 

“All very noble, Geis, but I’d 
like to know who came in second 
and third, at least, and how many 
votes each got. ’ ’ 

So would most of fandom and 
prodom and umpteen thousands of 
readers, Alter, but the convention 
committees are a law unto 
themselves, each year, and the clear 
wishes of the convention members are 
too often ignored.

GALAXY 



To say nothing of the nominees 
who didn’t win. Why in some 
categories there may have been as 
little difference as one or two per- 
cent between winner and second- 
place on the final ballot. — Baen 

* * * 

Hmmm. .Alter, do you catch 
a whiff of sour grapes? Ah, well — 
no, matter. On with the, ahem, 
winners. 

* * * 

Arghh! 

* * * 

**Cough-cough** A definite smell 
of brimstone in the air. .you 
were saying, Alter? 

“I see by what Susan reported 
that the committee in Melbourne did 
release the initial first place votes of 
the winners.” 

Yes, and it’s interesting to note 
that only the winner of the Best 
Novel Hugo won with an outright 
majority on the first ballot: The 
Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le 
Guin. 

“Says here it won 306 first place 
votes out of 5% votes cast.” 

It’s a fine novel and can stand up 
to any novel written in the so-called 
mainstream of literature. Ursula also 
won the Science Fiction Writers of 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



America Nebula Award for The 
Dispossessed , as well as the 
short story Nebula for “The Day 
Before The Revolution,” which was 
published last year in Galaxy. And 
recently won a National Book 
Award for The Farthest Shore. 
Quite a writer. 

“In your last column, Geis, you 
thought not too highly of “A Song 
for Lya” by George R. R. Martin, 
yet it won the Best Novella Hugo. 
What say you to that?” 

It received 153 first ballot votes 
out of 556. I still think Martin has 
an undistinguished, rather slow- 
paced style, but the story has great 

121 


impact in its final section and is a 
mind-expander and a prime 
thought-provoker. It sticks in your 
memory. 

I do think, though, that if Nor- 
man Spinrad’s “Riding the Torch” 
had been read by more of the voters 
last year, it would have won. 

“Uh-huh. How do you explain 
Harlan Ellison’s win of the Best 
Novelette Hugo with “Adrift Off 
the Islets of Langerhans. .”? As 
I recall the story infuriated you.” 

“Yes, it did, does, will. But for 
all that, Harlan writes like a fiend. 
He reaches out from the pages and 
grabs your mind and even if his sur- 
realist science fiction does raise my 
hackles — 

“He says he doesn’t write sci- 
ence fiction. It’s ‘speculative fic- 
tion’ or maybe not even that any- 
more. Just fiction.” 

Whatever. He grabs readers and 
they like what he writes. He hits 
like a drop forge in his stories. I sa- 
lute him. He has a rare talent and 
much guts. 

“He is the only author to have 
won six Hugos, isn’t he?” 

Yep, he has a shelf-full too. Well 
deserved. To continue the record: 
Harlan’s story received 121 initial 
first place votes out of 571. 

“Have you managed to find time 
to read Larry Niven’s “The Hole 
Man,” Geis? It won the Best Short 
Story Hugo.” 

Yes, and it’s a remarkable story 
for two reasons: it was published in 
the January issue of Analog and 

122 


persisted in the minds of enough 
people for well over a year to trig- 
ger a first place vote, and it is an 
excellent ‘hard science’ sf story 
with a massive kicker at the end. 

‘Susan Wood reports that “The 
Hole Man” received 158 first place 
votes of 551 cast, first ballot.” 

There are those in the fan world 
who would like to see this Austra- 
lian Ballot system abandoned, with 
the winner being simply the 
nominee who has the most votes 
when the ballots are first counted. It 
occasionally works out that a 
nominee initially in second place 
will gain enough ‘second’ place first 
place votes to eventually win, but 
almost always the first ballot leader 
is the final winner. 

“Do you have any interest in the 
Best Dramatic Hugo winner, 
Geis?” 

Honestly, not too much. The 
Hugos were originally a magazine/ 
book/fan set of awards, with the 
Dramatic category added years later, 
as I recall. I don’t think the 
motion picture/theatre/TV worlds 
hold their breaths waiting for word 
on this award. I don’t think it should 
be given. 

“Nevertheless, Young Franken- 
stein won this time, with 189 
of the 575 place votes. Too bad you 
didn’t see it, Geis. I understand it’s 
pretty good.” 

Oh, one day it’ll show up on 
Channel 2. Get on with the list, Al- 
ter. 

“How do you react to Ben Bova’s 
GALAXY 



winning the Best professional Editor 
Hugo Award for the third year in a 
row? The initial first place vote 
gave him 175 of 568.” 

I have to say it’s impossible to 
determine who is the best editor in 
the field. Especially it’s impossible 
for the average fan or reader who 
wants to vote intelligently. Very 
few people are privy to the inside 
information that would help decide. 
What would be the outcome in the 
field, for instance, if Jim Baen had 
the budget and prompt payment pol- 
icy of Analog for a year? Or Ted 
White? What would happen if Terry 
Carr had Analog ? What might Ed 
Ferman do with F&SF with an extra 
fifty thousand or so? Or Bob Sil- 
verberg with a well-financed monthly 
vehicle? Impossible questions to an- 
swer. 

‘‘I admire Baen for his innova- 
tions and risk-taking. Just asking 
you to be a columnist for If and now 
Galaxy. ...” 

Ha. Yes, that did take some 
courage. Ted White continues to 
present a surprisingly good product 
in Amazing and Fantastic. As 
does Jim, he labors under massive 
handicaps. Both display excellent 
editing skills. 

“Ed Ferman. What about him?” 

Ed continues, year in and year 
out, to present probably the highest 
average quality sf and fantasy of the 
*ot. He’s a ‘quiet’ editor who man- 
ages to get many, many fine stories. 

‘‘The same could be said for

telligent men with excellent taste 
and keen fiction perceptions. But 
they are anthology editors, and they 
lack the month-in, month-out pres- 
ence of a magazine. So tell me 
why Ben Bova won, Geis.” 

He has done a marvelous balancing 
act. He’s kept to the Campbell 
Analog formula and not seriously 
disturbed the solid Analog read- 
ership, while experimenting with 
‘soft’ science-fiction, new writers, 
new viewpoints, new dogmas. 

“You’re saying they all should 
win the Hugo?” 

I’m saying the category should go 
back to being called Best Profes- 
sional Magazine. That’s actually 
what Best Editor means — now, 
anyway — in the final analysis. 

“Ummph. Let us go on to Best 
Professional Artist.” 

I have a flash. .Kelly Freas won 
again, right? 

“Right. This is his fourth Hugo 
in a row and ninth win overall. This 
time his initial first-place votes were 
162 out of 588.” 

Year in and year out the voters 
love him, and he is the premier sf 
cover artist and illustrator. Superb 
drawing, technical mastery and 
color sense. 

“Heh, I see by the list that our 
zine, The Alien Critic (now Science 
Fiction Review) only had 127 out of 
575 first place votes on the first bal- 
lot. We probably only barely won 
the Best Fanzine Hugo.” 

‘We’, Alter? 

“Yes, WE, Geis! I have typed 
124 


my tendrils to the filiments for you, 
thought up humorous quips and bon 
mots, conceived excellent covers, 
taken care of the Archives

Yes, yes, you do contribute a lot of 
donkey work. Get on with the list. 

“It says here that a Richard E. 
Geis won the Best Fan Writer 
Hugo. Now THAT is an outrage! 
Just once before I die I want to see 
MY name on the ballot. ‘Best Fan 
Writer — Alter Ego!’ ” 

-Ho-ho. Never happen. / am 
master and full-credit-taker here. 
How many votes did I get? 

“Too many. 149 out of 509 on 
the first ballot. God only knows 
how many of those 149 belong to 
me. If there were any justice in this 
world—” 

Fortunately, Alter, there is no 
justice. The meek will never inherit 
the Earth. Rumors to the contrary 
are propaganda planted by the True 
Secret Masters to keep the huddled 
masses under control; promise them 
Heaven and give them Hell,, Politi- 
cal and religious leaders have 
known that for eons. Who won the 
Best Fan Artist Hugo? 

“Not so fast, Geis. I refuse to be 
hurried along and shamelessly ma- 
nipulated. I think I’ll just reveal a 
few bits of information. ...” 

Alter! Don’t — 

“Such as the rumors that Burt 
Akers, the author of the Dray Pres- 
cot Antares saga published by 
DAW, is the long-time English fan 
and professional, [CENSORED.]” 

galaxy 



Alter, he hasn’t confirmed — 

“And that one of the authors be- 
hind the Gregory Kern house name 
who write the CAP KENNEDY 
series for DAW is actually 
[LIKEWISE.]” 

Unproven! Unverified! You 
can’t — 

“And that the secret behind 
Michael Moorcock’s incredible pro- 
duction of novels is a sentient IBM 
Selectric named Jerry Cornelius 
who has a fondness for creating 
heroic Fantasy.” 

Stop! This is getting out of hand. 
Get back to the Hugo Awards 
or — or I’ll use the incantation and 
the amulet (I found them yesterday 
where you’d hidden them!) to force 
you to read every single word of 
Dhalgren again. 

“Arrrghh! Not that! Where- 
. .where was I? Yes, here. 
Bill Rotsler won the Best Fan Ar- 
tist Hugo. For lo these decades 
Bill’s clever, funny, biting cartoons 
and illustrations have graced genera- 
tion upon generation of fanzines. 
Now, long overdue, he has a Hugo. 
And the first ballot first place votes 
are convincing: 215 out of 555.” 

There’s more writing on that 
paper you have, Alter. More 
awards ? 

“Says here. The John W. 
Campbell Award for best new writ- 
er. Says here P.J. Plauger won it.” 

Don’t look blank, Alter. He de- 
served it and you know it. 

“May be, Geis, but damned if I 
can remember any of his stories.” 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 


For instance, he had a novelette 
in the February 1974 Analog. 
And there are others. 

“Well? Is he a good writer?” 

In “Wet Blanket”, the February 
Analog story, he writes witli 
genuine skill and talent, I think. He 
apparently has scientific training, 
and in this story he portrays a 
near-genius scientist who cannot 
trust his or any other government to 
keep the peace and not misuse his 
discoveries. I tire of the cliche ami 
the paranoia that runs through so 
many of Analog's stories, but 
the scientist/technician readers love 
to read about evil military/political 
villains and self-sacrificing, heroic 
I-know-best scientists. Plauger uses 
the theme well. 

“I have one more award here, 
Geis. The Grand Master of Fantasy 
(Gandalf) award, which went, this 
year, to our friend Fritz Leiber.” 
Nobody, but nobody will argue 
with that award. Fritz is a Grand 
Master of Fantasy. .and science 
fiction as well, I think. He lives in 
San Francisco now, but I remember 
him best from when we both lived 
on the ocean front in Venice, 
California. Me — 

“Us, Geis, US!” 

— You’n me, Alter, in that dinky 
one-room third floor apartment, and 
he in' that wonderfully cluttered 
ground floor apartment two blocks 
away. 

“Get off the nostalgia kick, Geis. 
Talk about science fiction. Say 
something outrageous.” 

125 



That’s your job, Alter. You say 
something monstrous. I need to 
throw you down into the dungeon 
again, as punishment. I admit to 
more than a mild discomfort at hav- 
ing you up here where we humans 
are. 

“Huh! You call yourselves hu- 
man? Most so-called humans, Geis, 
are concerned with money, power, 
sex and death. You have been 
taught to be ashamed of those inter- 
ests, however, and as a result you 
fill the air and fill printed pages 
with bullguana as you pretend 
otherwise. Hypocrisy is the first 
lesson a human child leams. After 
that it learns multitudes of varia- 
tions in the art. Now it has reached 
the point where whole industries 
and reputations, all kinds of vested 
interests, are built upon the Estab- 
lished Hypocrisies. If people sud- 
denly became honest with them- 
selves and others the economy of 
the world would undergo a revolu- 
tion, culture would be turned inside 
out and societies would be tumbled 
down to bedrock. But all this would 
heal with remarkable speed and lo, 
most people would be happy for a 
change. 

It is true you would have a 
new set of unemployed — religious 
leaders, politicians, many, many 
bureaucrats. .” 

Never happen, Alter. Too much 
money in unhappiness. 

“Bah, all humans are cowards.” 

Alter, I’m worried about you. 
You’ve just shown the first 


symptoms of that awful disease 
called Idealism. Tell me, when did 
you first feel a niggling dissatisfac- 
tion with reality? When did the 
word ‘should’ first worm into your 
mind? 

“BAH! Maybe you’re right, 
Geis. Maybe I don’t belong up here 
in your world. I’m going down to 
the Archives for a few hours of 
blessed solitude.”

Yes, he did it! Stepped into the

I ve a joy to share with you this 
month, and a confession of sorts to 
make. There are, I cop, some gap- 
ing holes in my background as an sf 
reviewer. There are classic novels 
I’ve never read, giant authors I 
know only by reputation, Big 
Names whose stuff I have never 
tried, either because the cover blurb 
turned me off ( stupid reason) or 
simply because no one whose 
judgement I respect recommended 
them highly enough. I’m conserva- 
tive about spending my sf dollar — I 
prefer a sure thing. 

And so I’ve only just discovered 
Edgar Pangborn. 

I haven’t been so delighted since 
(years ago, thank God) I discovered 


128 


GALAXY 



Theodore Sturgeon. In fact, the 
comparison is apt. I like Pangbom 
and Sturgeon for very similar 
reasons. Both are thoughtful, ma- 
ture writers, and both remind me at 
times of Brunner’s Chad Mulligan, 
bitter drunk, crying at the world, 
“Goddamit, I love you all.” Both 
are bitterly disappointed in man’s 
evil, and both are hopelessly in love 
with man’s good. Both are addicted 
to creating and falling in love with 
warmly human, vibrantly alive 
characters, and making you love 
them too. 

A Mirror For Observers, a win- 
ner of the International Fantasy 
Award (like Sturgeon’s More Than 
Human), is not a great book. But it 
certainly deserves its inclusion in 
Avon/Equinox’s ‘‘SF Rediscovery” 
line (an estimable series of books, 
at best forgotten classics, at worst 
interesting historical landmarks). It 
may be called “early Pangborn,” 
copyright 1954 (nine years after 
Edgar went free-lance, his second 
novel), and it has its share of weak- 
nesses. The plot, in the light of 
modern sf standards, is implausible 
when it isn’t trite; the alleged 
“Martian observers” are purely 
human archetypes; and some of the 
dialogue is just godawful. 

But read it as an allegory of the 
struggle between good and evil, and 
it becomes thoughtful, incisive, and 
magnificent in scope. It is a slap in 
cynicism’s face, a letter of reference 
to God on behalf of humanity, the 
story of a bitter conflict for posses- 


sion of a single human soul, and its 
happy outcome. Imagine Ambrose 
Bierce as thesis, and Mirror as an- 
tithesis: no timid apology, nor even 
spirited defense, but a quiet, as- 
sured denial of the indictment. 
You’ve already heard me heap 
guano on the Campbell Memorial 
Award judges who alleged that the 
“recognition of the fallen state of 
man” was “a requirement of all 
great literature.” Well, Mirror ful- 
fills one of my own prime criteria 
for all great literature: it helped • 
concile me to the tragic joy of being 
alive. 

Maybe you believe that every- 
thing sucks and we’re all full of 
shit. Most of you live in America, 
so I grant you the evidence is con- 
vincing. So go read Mirror For Ob- 
servers and remember why you 
consented to be bom. 

You did, you know. 

* * * 

Having been wiped out by early 
Pangborn, I shoveled through the 
mountain of review copies I keep 
piled by the stove (makes sense — 
half of them end up in it) for some 
more Pangborn I could review. (I 
haven’t had time for recreational 
reading in months — do you people 
realize the sacrifices I make for 
you? Wading doggedly and dutifully 
through the monthly sludge when 
I’ve had three prime John D. Mac- 
Donalds waiting on my desk for 
ages?) All I could find were some

short stories, and so I discovered 
two — or rather, four — peachy an- 
thologies, one okay and one simply 
superb. (Digression/hint: if the pub- 
lishers of Pangborn’s Davy and 
Good Neighbors are listening, know 
that I would give prompt and care- 
ful attention to review copies of 
same. His The Company of Glory 
was published in Galaxy; I may re- 
view it anyway.) I may as well take 
the okay one first; I can see that it 
will require the most space by sheer 
weight of wordage. It comprises 
four books, of which I have re- 
ceived three. 

Editors love gimmicks. Theme 
collections, several writers using an 
identical first chapter, male and 
female writers assigned the same 
theme: the average editor is a 
sucker for ’em. And ever since 
Heinlein’s Future History series and 
Howard’s Hyborian Age, writers 
(me included, Mr. Callahan) have 
been suckers for the “extended 
story,” the continuous-background 
story or novel sequence. A hack 
will use this device to milk a single 
vision for several publish- 
er’s checks; a master will use the 
extra space to weave a wider, 
deeper, richer tapestry. 

In the latter hope, Roger El wood 
commissioned a total of 11 authors 
to write 32 stories for the Con- 
tinuum series. The 4-story cycles 
(and one “revolving authorship” 
— gimmick within a gimmick!) were 
to be connected, but not inter- 
dependent — you shouldn’t have to 


read Continuum I, 2 and 3 to ap- 
preciate a story in 4. Nonetheless I 
waited until 1 had all but Continuum 3 
before reading them for review, to 
check on Elwood’s claim. I read 
Philip Jose Farmer back-to-front, 
Pangborn front-to-back, then said the 
hell with it and read the rest of the stuff 
one book after another in the order 
you’re supposed to. 

The standout, of course, was 
Pangborn. I was deeply gratified to 
see the maturity of the talent that 
had written Mirror in 1954. “The 
Children’s Crusade” in C-l is a 
magnificent account of the March of 
the Mutant Children to Nuber; “The 
Legend, of Hombas” in C-2 was a 
thrilling affirmation that human 
wisdom, no matter how many times 
lost, will always be recreated; and 
“Mam Sola’s House” in C-4 was a 
subtle and yet broadly hilarious 
anecdote. “Hombas” at least was 
Hugo quality, and each tale is itself 
sufficient justification for buying the 
book it comes in. 

The stories share only the 
background world in which I’m told 
Pangborn’s Davy is set. 

Fanner’s series, however, was a 
simple “continued-story” format, a 
Tragedy In Four Acts. Each story 
taken by itself is only a fragment, and 
reading them in -reverse order 
(which by Elwood’s premise should 
have been okay) was like reading 
something that’s been nettirw 
sdrawkcab — you can make sense 
out of it, but only with effort. 
(Fully aware of this, Farmer spent 


130 


GALAXY 



the first half of the second story in 
a clumsy recap of the one before. I 
don’t know what he did in C-3, 
where the recap must have been fat- 
ter, but by C-4 he abandoned it en- 
tirely: the last story, by itself, is 
unbalanced and confusing.) When 
painstakingly assembled, the pieces 
formed a story that I thought was 
shallow and second rate. 

Poul Anderson’s stories all take 
place on Rustum, the world of his 
1961 Orbit Unlimited (itself a col- 
lection of three connected but dis- 
crete novelettes), and all take their 
plot from Rustum’s unique cartog- 
raphy. The stories aren’t perhaps 
Poul’s best, but they are master’s 
work; and it was good to meet up 
with Joshua and Danny Coffin 
again — I enjoyed all three heartily. 
Poul’s a thoughtful writer. 

On the other end of the scale 
were Thomas N. Scortia’s “Ar- 
mageddon Tapes” series, which I 
found unreadable and boring; Gene 
Wolfe’s stories, which I couldn’t 
make head nor tail out of (which 
may be only a measure of my ig- 
norance); Anne McCaffrey’s “Kil- 
lashandra The Crystal Singer” 
series, cloying and trite despite a 
breathtaking premise; and the 
revolving-authorship Robot-world 
series, some of which were well- 
written and all of which were 
minor. I like Chad Oliver, and 
found two of his “Caravans Unli- 
mited” yams good if routine (didn’t 
like “Shaka!” in C-l at all), but 
taken together they make me won-

der if there isn’t at least one planet 
out there that isn't a dead ringer for 
Africa, or one alien society that 
ain’t a ringer for primitive man. By 
the end of the series, everything ex- 
cept bare- bone plot mechanics was 
a cliche, and neither characters nor 
the single moral question considered 
(“Is it okay to mess with primitive 
cultures?”) grew after the first story. 
Not depth but repetition. 

At 950 each of the Continuum 
books are a fair buy by today’s 
standards, but you might want to 
borrow a friend’s copies for the 
Pangborn and Anderson. (A minor 
gripe: it seems to me, perhaps in 
my naivete, that it ought to be 
possible to proof out at least almost 
all of the typos in a given book. 
C-4 ' s printer consistently turns 
“e”s into “s”s and “o”s into 
“e”s. Okay, maybe he was work- 
ing from a muddy carbon — but why 
did so many errors go unrepaired?) 

* * ★ 

Inflamed by Pangborn-hunger, I 
next selected Tomorrow Today, 
edited by the redoubtable George 
Zebrowski, and published as the 
first of Unity Press’s new “Planet 
Series”. This was a clear case of 
following the trail of tusks to the 
Elephant’s Graveyard itself. 

The cover design by Eric Mathes 
is unquestionably the best I have 
ever seen on a book of sf, strikingly 
beautiful and spiritual. The 
spectrum-of- style provided by Zeb- 


rowski’s selection of authors is daz- 
zlingly wide and rich. And each and 
every story in the book is a pure 
masterpiece of its type. 

Oh, one of the stories (Norman 
Kagen’s “Counter Ecology”) I 
“didn’t care for” in the sense that 
one prefers scotch to gin. But it was 
damned good gin. Similarly, two of 
the stories (Chelsea Quinn Yarbro’s 
and Mack Reynolds’s) had incredibly 
cliched premises (1 first read the 
basic plot of Reynolds’s “Visitor” 
in a Marvel comic in 1956, which 
means it was ancient then), but both 
are excellent stories, consummately 
crafted. And John McHale’s pomp- 
ous introduction nearly convinced 
me the book was going to be awful, 
but it wasn’t. 

Boy, was it wasn’t. Gregory and 
Jim Benford’s “John of the 
Apocalypse” was one of the most 
chilling glimpses of a possible (who 
dat say “probable”?) future I’ve 
ever read; “In the Wind” by Glen 
Cook (a new writer to me, Clarion 
grad) was excellent in spite of a 
bonehead printer who ran the foot- 
notes in the body of the text; James 
Stevens’ “Syn” was a remarkable 
extrapolation of the war mentality to 
its logical culmination; and the 
Pangborn . oh, the Pangbom! 

I hereby nominate “Harper 
Conan and Singer David” for the 
Hugo Award for Best Short Story, 
and recommend it to every one of 
you out there. Having discovered 
Pangborn, I now have the happy 
duty of turning my wife Jeanne on

to him, and this is the one I’ll start 
her on. It is one of the most warmly 
human stories I’ve ever read, and 
made me laugh and cry aloud in the 
space of 22 pages. Partly because of 
it, and partly because of the total 
content of the book, I further nomi- 
nate Tomorrow Today for the Best 
Anthology Hugo— at least, so far. 
It’s September as I write this, and 
who knows what Christmas will 
bring? 

But at the very least, this is the 
one to beat for this year’s honors. 
Solid, thoughtful, adult stories, 
worth even the stiff $3.95 pricetag 
(the cover is worth it). A Best Buy. 

* * * 

John Boyd is another name 
heretofore unknown to me (the 
copyright is in the name of “Boyd 
Upchurch”, which makes it even 
more confusing), but his An- 
dromeda Run shows signs of great 
promise. It isn’t a great book, but it 
bears the signs of a writer who just 
may have a great book or two (or 
three) in him somewhere. It con- 
cerns an alien missionary of non- 
material nature, “G-7,” who in- 
sinuates himself into the brain of a 
two-bit gunman and bank-robber in 
America’s Old West, partly to lead 
Mankind to enlightenment and 
partly to satisfy his own craving for 
corporeal existence. The results are 
entirely hilarious, a kind of humor 
that reminds me of Gordy Dickson 
at his funniest and partly of The 


Ballad of Dingus McGee (the excel- 
lent book, not the clumsy movie 
rip-off), to which Gun bears a 
strong resemblance. The off-color 
joke which builds from p. 84 to its 
outrageous punchline on p. 90 is 
alone worth the 950, as is the saga 
of the Smallest Building In The 
World With Flying Buttresses. 

The book has, as I say, its flaws: 
the first six pages in particular were 
so floridly overwritten as to be 
barely comprehensible, and from 
time to time the prose stumbles. But 
I enjoyed it, and I think you will 
too. I’d like to see Mr. Boyd’s next 
book.

The Eden Cycle by Raymond Z. 
Gallun would have made a peachy 
novelette, out it has one of those 
premises that only a genius could 
make into a satisfying novel. Gallun 
posits a race of aliens who come to 
Earth and offer us total Sensory Ex- 
perience Simulation — that is, the 
literal fulfillment of our every wish. 
Their process conveys effective 
immortality (I don’t know what 
happened to entropy) and will pro- 
vide any sensory experience im- 
aginable. You cannot, of course, 
physically harm any other human or 
alien being. In fact, you can’t do 
anything physically — your body lies 
comatose while you live in a world 
of utterly real -seeming fantasy, 
which follows your every whim. 
Some humans even allow their 


BOOKSHELF 


133 



physical being to be refined down 
to Basic Personality Nodules, 
stacked in a subterranean vault like 
so many cantaloupes. No one, appa- 
rently, turns down the aliens’ 
offer — though this is unclear; hold- 
outs may have simply died off. 

Except for this last implausibility, 
the premise is fascinating: sort of 
Total Television. But what Gallun 
makes of it is largely a T.V, Guide, 
a catalogue of all the basic human 
fantasies, presented one after the 
other in repetitious and ultimately 
stultifying procession. Eden Cycle is 
about two people (realsies) who 
wade through an endless series of 
imaginary dramas before opting for 
real life — but they know from the 
start that the imaginary dramas are 
only imaginary dramas, and when 
they finally do get as bored as I was 
pages ago and have the aliens return 
them to real bodies on the real sur- 
face of the real planet Earth (which 
is okay by the aliens: satisfaction 
guaranteed or your karma refunded), 
they end up copping out. Real 
Life, they discover, entails the hor- 
rid possibilities of failure and death: 
surely fantasy is preferable. The 
hell of it is that Gallun seems (if 1 
read him rightly) to approve of their 
choice. They come across as 

idealists who decide to work within 
0 

the system to beat the system, and 
I’ve heard that one before, thank 
you. 

It takes an imaginative writer to 
string total wish-fulfillment out over 
232 pages, and for my money Gal- 


lun didn’t pull it off. As Lester Del 
Rey says, when anything can hap- 
pen, who cares what does? 

* * * 

Buy Jupiter and other stories is 
recommended for all Isaac Asimov 
fans, but I wouldn’t give it to a 
neofan who wants to know who is 
dis Asimov feeler anyway. Though 
some of its 24 stories are quite good 
(I especially liked “The Greatest 
Asset,” “The Pause,” “Day of 
The Hunters” and the title story), 
the majority are distinctly minor. 
Some are outrageous tomato sur- 
prises {poof! — a tomato hits you in 
the face) that nobody else in the 
world could get away with (in par- 
ticular “Shah Guido G.”), and 
some are mere throwaway pieces 
that show signs of being written in 
a hurry. 

But, as with The Early Del Rey 
(reviewed in the September 1975 
Galaxy Bookshelf), what makes the 
book are the introductions, the can- 
did glimpses into the personal and 
professional life of Isaac Asimov, 
Gent. If you’re an Asimov fan like 
I am, you’ll enjoy the biographical 
commentary and sf anecdotes, 
which are an extension of those in 
Isaac’s Before The Golden Age and 
The Early Asimov. If you’re not 
an Asimov fan, avoid this like the 
plague, and go read Foundation. 
Then read this one.

I can’t give Time For The Stars 
the space it deserves. First of all, 
I’m running out of room, and sec- 
ond of all I’ve been blowing Hein- 
lein’s horn so consistently in this 
column that it’s beginning to get 
monotonous even for me. Suffice it 
to say that this Heinlein-juvenile is 
about star travel: about relativistic 
effects in human terms, as felt by a 
youth riding a just-less-than-light- 
speed ship while telepathically in 
contact with his twin brother on 
Earth; and about the chaos into 
which physics collapses when said 
telepathy demonstrates irrefutably 
that the concept of simultaneity has 
meaning. Along the way, of course, 
it can’t help but be an exciting and 
absorbing adventure; in spite 
of the usual ghastly cover painting 
by “Steele Savage,” the direct an- 
tithesis of the kind of thing Mathes 
did for Tomorrow Today. (Aesthetic 
discomfort has forced me to rewrap 
all of Ace’s Heinlein-juvenile re- 
prints in plain brown paper.) 

* ★ ★ 

Couple more quickies before I 
go. There’s not much point in say- 
ing a whole lot about Laurence M. 
Janifer’s 18 Greatest Science Fic- 
tion Stories (formerly Master’s 
Choice), or the late Groff Conklin’s 
Minds Unleashed (formerly Giants 
Unleashed). Most of you are proba- 
bly long familiar with the stories 
contained — they are, every one, 
acknowledged classics of the field, 


often anthologized, and these collec- 
tions themselves are in their 
umpty-umpth edition. If you aren’t 
familiar with each and every story 
in them, you couldn’t possibly get a 
better buy. There you go. 

(Oh year — if you’re trying to turn 
someone on to sf, these are two of 
the books to do it with. As is Zeb- 
rowski’s Tomorrow Today.) 

* * * 

But don’t start them with Richard 
Avery’s The Expendables #2: The 
Rings of Tantalus. Nothing on my 
review copy indicates that it’s sup- 
posed to be a juvenile, so I must 
assume Avery meant it for adults. It 
fails for either audience. It reminds 
me of Captain Midnight, with sex 
added and the science a little wa- 
tered down. Trash — don’t waste 
your time. 

By next month I should have had 
a chance to catch the first few in- 
stallments of the new T.V. series 
Space 1999 and if it’s half as bad as 
I expect it will be, I’ll have some 
fireworks for you. Also I hope to 
present the bizarre story of how 
A.E. Van Vogt (or at least, one of 
his books) was found back to back 
with a naked blonde in a deli in 
Halifax. And other stories. 

Till then — have a happy.

1999 premiered. Subsequently 
your kindly editor called me here in 
Nova Scotia, and asked me to warn 
you. 

Because there exists a slim possi- 
bility that there’s a lone reader out 
there who has not only missed all 
the episodes so far (I hate this pub- 
lishing lag — might as well be talk- 
ing to you by radio from Alpha 
Centauri), but who has no friends, 
who was therefore thinking of 
catching Space 1999 this week. If 
so — if you’re the guy — I strongly 
suggest that you will have a lot 
more fun if you put your head down 
the toilet. 

This on the strength of one 
episode. I locked myself in my bed- 
room with the babble-box (we had 
company that night) so I wouldn’t 
miss a minute. I intended to give 
the show a fair trial. Imagine my 
horror when I discovered that the 
fattest of my guests had tipped his 
chair against my door from the out- 
side, and I really was locked in! I 
was found several hours later by the 
RCMP Rescue Squad, collapsed 
across the tube, trying weakly to de- 
stroy it with profanity. The flowers 
on my dresser were dead, and the 
flies were tearing each other to 
pieces. 

The scriptwriter is George Beliak, 
whose only qualifications for writing 
sf seem to consist of having seen 2001 
with cotton in his ears. To para- 
phrase Casey At The Bat, the director 
was a pudding and the gadgetry a 
fake. Co-stars Landau and Bain 

136 


looked like they’d be real handy 
this winter, cut down to stove 
length and split. The hideously ex- 
pensive special effects were inaccu- 
rate and dull, derived equally from 
2001 and Earthquake ; and if there’s 
a science consultant connected with 
the show, he must have no shaving 
mirror. I can’t bear to describe the 
premise for the series — if you’re the 
hypothetical innocent described 
above, go find, an sf fan, ask him, 
and then wait until he stops laugh- 
ing. Bring a lunch. 

God damn it to hell, how did it 
happen? Do you realize they spent a 
quarter of a million dollars on each 
episode? Millions of bucks were put 
into a pot to be spent on television 
sf, and this is what we got. Do fans 
really get the kind of TV they de- 
serve? Is it somehow our fault? 
Hasn’t it occurred to one of the 
soul-less, brainless shit peddlers of 
what Harlan calls Cloud-Cuckoo- 
Land that if they intend to milk sci- 
ence fiction the way they have 
everything else, it just might be a 
good idea to consult with some of 
the professionals and fans of science 
fiction? To read some sf? Won’t 
there ever be a mature, adult, 
well-written sf series on television? 
Hell, even the cop-shows produced 
Baretta. 

Watch Space 1999? I’d infinitely 
rather drop the babble-box into the 
root cellar, step out the door and 
through the woodshed, and watch 
space. 

I suggest you do likewise. ★

HUNGER ON THE 
HOMESTRECH 


Kevin O'Donnell, Jr. 



He had come a long way 
and suffered much. Now 
it was time for the Pay- 
off — but he was broke. 


__ Monday 

He glared at his landlady 
with undisguised disgust, A big, 
bosomy woman, she leaned easily 
against the door jamb. The hem of 
her cheap print dress was torn and 
drooping; the tip of her filter- 
cigarette was smeared with bright 
scarlet lipstick. She blew a lazy 
smoke ring. “If you don’t like it,” 
she was saying, “you can always 
move out.” Her cool eyes tracked 
the smoke ring as it rolled posses- 
sively across his living room. 

No words could work theii* way 
past the fury in his throat. He 
watched the writhing smoke impact 
against the cracked plaster wall and 
ripple away from the crushed car- 
cass of a mosquito. “Look,” he 
heard himself pleading in his thick 
accent, “I only vant this place for 
another two months. How bout you 
holt the rent down until I’m gone, 
huh?” 

Cigarette ashes tumbled like the 


dirty grey snow of the city. 
“Nope,” she said flatly. “No deal. 
Your lease expires next week and 
you either pay or get out.” 

“Now look,” he protested, hop- 
ing that something besides profit 
could penetrate the coin purse of 
her brain, “my research is near 
frnisht! Two months, it’s all I neet 
and all I ask. Then I go avay and 
you can raise the rent to vatever 
you vant.” 

“And in the meantime I lose 
money on your room? Whaddaya 
think I am, crazy or something?” 
She saw dismay on his pudgy face 
and cared little; every tenant 
showed it when she raised the rent. 
But behind that look glimmered 
another, akin to terror. That in- 
terested her. She allowed her sharp 
voice to soften, and with a heavy 
sigh, she began, “Mr. Schwartz, 
you know I’m sorry to do this to 
you, but the taxes have gone up, 
fuel’s gone up, Joe the janitor wants 
a raise — ” she shook her head pon- 
derously “ — it’s this damn infla- 
tion, gobbling up my whole profit 
margin.” 

“Inflation!” he moaned. His fin- 
gers tugged thick locks of his long 
brown hair. “If I hear that vord vun 
more time, I think I go crazy! 
Everybody in town, he raises his 
prices because he says if he don’t, 
inflation vill vipe him out. Ant me, 
I ask for them to giff me little more 
on my grant, and vat do they say? 
They say, ‘Schvartz, times are hart, 
inflation ate up all our money and

ve got none to giff you!’ ” He 
dropped onto the battered green 
couch, not noticing how the sudden 
stress of his 225 pounds widened 
the rip in its motheaten cover. “I 
fint the money somevere, voman. 
Now you go, leaf me alone vit my 
empty stomach ant my emptier val- 
let.” 

“Well!” She sniffed, and tossed 
her stringy blond hair, sorry she had 
attempted to show him the warm 
heart under her folds of flesh. “If I 
were you,” she said with spiteful 
malice, “I’d sell that damn radio 
you’re always fussing with, and use 
the money for rent, for furniture, 
and for some decent clothes. That’s 
what I’d do.” She flounced away, 
slamming the thin door behind her. 
A shaken cloud of plaster dust fell 
from the ceiling. 

Schwartz sagged, and his eyes 
began to sting. He knew that the 
room, barren except for the broken 
sofa on which he slept, and the 
chrome-stripped device she called 
his “damn radio,” was gloomy, 
dusty, and desolate. He knew that 
his too-often mended clothes with 
their frayed cuffs and ineradicable 
stains made him a figure of fun. He 
knew that already; she didn’t have 
to tell him! That kind of rubbing it 
in . noisily, he blew his bulbous 
nose on a torn handkerchief. 

An extra fifty dollars a month! 
There was no way he could afford 
it. His budget had been prepared 
years before, and the rampant infla- 
tion of the two years he’d been here 


had caught him in a trap of over- 
planning. Mr. Anonymous, they 
had said he would be. Mr. Have- 
just-enough-money-to-play-the -role- 
and-not-enough-to- draw -anybody’ s- 
attention. Bah! He spat on the floor, 
wishing it were the desk of a certain 
economist who thought prediction 
possible. Here he was, round like a 
silly balloon because he couldn’t 
afford anything ,but bloating, starchy 
foods like bread and potatoes. His 
drumskin-tight budget was stretched 
to molecular thinness, and it still 
couldn’t cover expenses. 

Well, to hell with orders about 
radio silence; it was time to demand 
some help. They could not expect 
him to do anything more, not when 
the crack they had spent twenty 
years prying open was about to be 
plastered shut. 

He pushed himself to his feet 
with a grunt, and plodded across the 
bare boards. His wide feet stirred 
up the dust he never seemed to get 
around to sweeping. 

At the control panel of the five- 
foot high, eight-foot long device, he 
flicked half a dozen switches and 
plugged in a microphone. Then, 
turning a dial until the oscilloscope 
readings fell into a familiar pattern, 
he bent his head and spoke in his 
native language. “Come in, Com- 
mand, come in.” 

“Ja. Command here. Why — ” 

Chilled by the ice in the other 
voice, he said quickly, “Counterfeit 
some more money for me, at once. 
Send it immediately.”

“Impossible. Rioters burned the 
Mint. Everything is gone — the 
emergency funds, the plates, the 
paper, even the engraver. It has al- 
ready caused an economic crisis. 
Production of our own currency has 
first priority. You will have to 
wait.” 

“How long?” 

“Two months, perhaps.” 

“But it’s only nine weeks to The 
Day.” 

“We know that.” 

“But she’s raising the rent, and 
I’ll be forced to leave — ” 

“Then you must find the neces- 
sary funds some other way. Out.” 
Schwartz’s receiver clicked once 
and lapsed into a low hum. He 
stared at it blankly, unable to com- 
prehend that he had been cut off 
like a delivery boy clamoring for 
the master of the house. Of their 
own volition, his fingers reached for 
the call button, but he jerked them 
back at the touch of the slick grey 
plastic. The ice in the other voice 
could change easily to fire; he 
wanted at all costs to avoid that. 
His record w'as spotty enough as it 
was. 

With a muttered curse, he un- 
plugged the microphone and re- 
turned it to its niche. A quick swipe 
of his hand threw the switches to 
the off position; the small green 
lights, which had glistened through 
the transmission, darkened. Numb- 
ly, he trudged across the empty 
room and fell lengthwise on the 
couch. 


Tuesday 

Smog-sapped sunlight, an invalid 
on an obstacle course, was feeling 
its way through the dust and grease 
on the east window. He rubbed the 
grey stubble on his jaws, trying to 
remember what it was that he had 
to do. 

After a moment it- came to him, 
as it did every morning, and he 
walked across the room. His run- 
down heels made lonely tapping 
sounds; their half-hearted echoes 
deepened his sense of abandonment. 

“I don’t know why I bother any 
more,” he mumbled in the tongue 
he spoke only in the isolation of his 
room. “Why should I try to keep 
the way clear for them, when they 
will not raise a single finger to help 
me when I need it?” He curled his 
own stubby fingers around a toggle 
switch and checked the chronometer 
imbedded in the chrome paneling. 
11:49, with the sweep-hand ap- 
proaching the minute mark. When it 
reached exact vertical, he pulled the 
switch and held it down for five 
seconds. Released, it snapped back 
with a solid thwack. 

A foot away, he twisted a dial 
and watched green waves of light 
wash across the screen of the oscil- 
loscope. Steady, even, perfect 
symmetry. The five-second burst of 
energy had kept the tunnel walls 
smooth and disciplined. Like prun- 
ing a hedge, he sometimes thought, 
a hedge of wild, unruly spatial- 
temporal shrubs that would fill the 
tunnel if they weren’t burned back 


HUNGER ON THE HOMESTRETCH

with monotonous regularity. The 
oscilloscope patterns dissolved into 
green snow as the technicians at the 
other end applied their own elec- 
tronic shears. Before it returned to 
normal, he had switched it off. 

He was in trouble. He had to 
raise a bare minimum of one 
hundred dollars, and quickly. If he 
failed, he would lose thejr only 
beachhead. They simply couldn’t 
find another, because the tunnel, the 
carefully-maintained tunnel that had 
cost them an atomic bomb on the 
other side and the worst power 
blackout in history on this, the tun- 
nel ended right in his room. Fifteen 
years of work, by himself, by the 
previous operatives, and by the 
amazingly resourceful engineer who 
had patched together a prototype of 
this machine from local radio 
parts — it would all go to waste. De- 
spite his irritation, he remained loyal; 
he couldn’t let that happen. 

If only there were no need to 
prune it from both ends. But the 
“branches” didn’t grow in front of 
the two mouths, they grew along 
and out of the inner walls. Each 
blast snapped off only those which 
grew towards its source, and those 
which were perpendicular to the 
tunnel walls. Those bending in the 
opposite direction were only flat- 
tened, to spring back up and 
obstruct the path as soon as the 
pressure was released. 

Damn. He lifted a tom sofa cush- 
ion, and squeezed his hand through 
a rent in the grey cloth over the 


springs. His fingers drew out a thin 
envelope. His bankroll, each bill 
was the work of a master forger 
with all the resources of an anxious 
government behind him. He fanned 
the deliberately aged bills. Not 
enough. No matter how many times 
he counted them, there were never 
enough. As the days trundled past, 
they grew fewer and fewer and he 
could see that when The Day came, 
there would be none. In fact, there 
would have been none for some 
weeks already. 

He had no choice. Returning the' 
envelope to its cache, he re- 
positioned the faded cushion and 
rose to his feet with a resigned sigh. 
Standing orders were to stay by the 
radio, in case of emergency, but 
they had to be disregarded. He 
would get a job. He could stand to 
work with these people for the short 
time needed to earn one hundred 
dollars. Any emergencies would 
have to wait. If he worked longer, 
he realized, he could earn enough to 
pay for a decent meal, and maybe 
even for a new white shirt. Buoyed 
by the prospect, he gave his room a 
last worried glance , and waddled 
out. 

* * * 

The harried, shirt-sleeved man at 
the employment agency was neither 
helpful nor hopeful. He scowled at 
the form Schwartz had handed him, 
then leaned back in his metal swivel 
chair. “Mr. Schwartz,” he began, 


142 


GALAXY 



“I’m going to be honest with you. I 
don’t think you have a chance of 
finding a job in your specialty.’’ 
“But this country needs qualified 
electronic technicians, ja?’’ He felt 
a flutter in his heart and a queasi- 
ness in his stomach. It was demean- 
ing enough to have to ask, but to be 
told that . perhaps the man did 
not understand. Maybe he saw only 
the rumpled, ancient suit and the 
whiskery face, and thought he was 
unreliable, an alcoholic or a dere- 
lict. “I assure you, sir, I haff the 
excellent training ant skills, ant — ” 
The man threw up his hands 
helplessly. “I understand that, Mr. 
Schwartz, and I believe you. But 
you see, with government funding 
for scientific research cut to the 
lowest it’s been in forty years, and 
with unemployment in general run- 
ning at 13% — ” he put his elbows 
on the desk and lowered his drawn 
face into his hands “ — every job in 
this field has been taken by out- 
of-work engineers, physicists, 
mathematicians . hell, in a little 
radio repair shop down the street, 
there’s a Ph. D. in chemistry work- 
ing for $2.68 an hour.’’ His eyes 
lifted, and bore into Schwartz. “I 
haven’t seen an opening in months. 
And if I ever do — ” he glanced at 
an open file folder on his cluttered 
desk “ — well, you’re number 638.” 
A cold breeze shivered his large 
body. “Veil, then,” he said in a 
tone that tried to be jocular but 
came out shaken, “I vill take any- 
thing. Anything you got, I take.” 


“Yeah, sure,” muttered the man. 
“Anything, huh? I’ll put you on our 
‘anything’ list.” His fingers danced 
on the keys of the computer termi- 
nal set into his desk; he frowned at 
the reply on the read-out screen. 
“But I’m afraid that’s not much bet- 
ter, Mr. Schwartz.” 

“Oh.” He shifted his weight to 
look at the screen. An embalmer’s 
needle injected bleak despair into 
his veins. “I see,” he said in a hol- 
low voice. “Number 9849.” 

“I’m afraid so.” 

“How long a vait do you think it 
vill be?” 

A humorless chuckle slipped out 
of the man. “Six, seven weeks be- 
fore we have that many openings in 
the entire metropolitan area. But 
maybe a little longer to find one that 
fits you.” Measuring Schwartz with 
his eyes, he shook his head sadly, 
as if they’d need a very large open- 
ing. “All I can say, Mr. Schwartz, 
is stay by your telephone and wait 
for our call.” 

“Ja, tanks,” he murmured, ris- 
ing with the lumbering, disbelieving 
movements of a penguin that has 
missed its prey. “I vill do that. Ant 
you do the best you ca huh, young 
man?” 

“I certainly will.” Eager to end 
the interview on a. high note, he 
stretched his hand across the desk. 
“Good luck, Mr. Schwartz,” he 
said sincerely. 

“Ja, thanks.” He held the hand 
for a brief instant, and then let it 
drop. Politeness, he thought as he

stumbled out into the crowded wait- 
ing room, was one thing, but actual 
physical contact was . was 
maybe something he had best get 
used to until The Day came. 

* * * 

That afternoon, after an hour of 
gloomy pacing, he threw open the 
grimy window and thrust his face 
into the blustery winter wind. Be- 
low, hurrying people huddled in 
heavy coats. He watched pocket- 
books swing and fancied he could 
hear silver coins jingle. Don't be 
romantic, he warned himself, they 
don’t use silver here any more. All 
the same . 

Stepping back into the room, he 
pulled the window down and leaned 
thoughtfully against the wall’s cold 
plaster. He could get the money, 
with very little trouble, if the men 
at the training camp had been right. 
“You are now programmed for 
life,” they had said, “and you will 
never lose what we have given you 
here. You may get rusty, and your 
endurance may drop, but the moves 
and the postures are deep in you as 
your mother’s maiden names. You 
can never forget them.” If they 
were right, if five years of training 
hadn’t been erased by ten years of 
dissipation, then he could raise a 
hundred dollars — and more, and 
more! — with less trouble than he 
had thought. 

Shortly after sundown, he found 
his first victim in Riverdale. Wait- 


ing behind a thick tree trunk, he 
heard confident footsteps. Poised on 
the balls of his feet, he let the 
middle-aged businessman take one 
more step. Then his right hand went 
up as his left foot went forward; 
sole scraped sidewalk just as hand 
struck suntanned neck. The man 
crumpled. Schwartz’s massive left 
arm whipped around his victim’s chest 
and dragged him into the shadows. 

Two minute? later, the hand- 
tooled calfhide wallet had yielded 
$24.00. Schwartz fingered the col- 
lection of credit cards for a mo- 
ment. The embossed plastic nu- 
merals pressed through the cool 
slickness of his rubber gloves. Then 
he shook his head, returned the 
cards, and slid the wallet into the 
man’s coat. 

He felt a cold burning in his 
lungs and studied the sprawled fi- 
gure. Left alone, his victim would 
freeze to death. And in that 
neighborhood, with the residents’ 
fear of muggers — a proper fear, 
thought Schwartz with a trace of 
irony — the man wouldn’t be noticed 
till morning. His eyes raked the 
dusk for the familiar sight of a fire 
alarm box. 

He laid the man’s briefcase and 
hat on his stomach, then hoisted 
him. Checking that there were no 
dog.- walkers nearby, he half- 
sprinted, half-staggered to the alarm 
box. After setting him down and 
folding his chill hands across the 
briefcase, Schwartz pulled the alarm. 
By the time the fire engines came 


144 


GALAXY 




and the firemen spotted the body, 
he was four blocks away and moving 
fast. 

* * * 

Later that evening, in another 
part of the city, he unfolded the six 
bills and smoothed each one out. 
He couldn’t shake a nagging guilt. 
For twenty-four dollars, he had 
nearly killed a man. As he stared at 
the faces of foreign heroes, there 
floated through his mind the notion 
that he wouldn’t be so unhappy if 
the victim had had over a hundred 
dollars. 

One hundred dollars would en- 
sure the success of the mission. For 
that, he realized with a flicker of 
resentment towards the men who 


had programmed him as though he 
had no more principles than a com- 
puter, for that he would kick an old 
lady into the path of a bus. And 
glow with pride, if success fol- 
lowed. 

But when, like now, the violence 
didn’t result in the success it had 
seemed to promise, when it was 
only an unnecessary prelude to 
further violence ... he refused the 
waitress’ offer of more coffee and 
handed her one of the bills. The 
conditioning hadn’t deprived him of 
all his scruples and he felt like a 
heel. Damn that businessman, he 
thought as he took his change and 
counted out a fair tip, damn him for 
making me do that again. Stepping 
out into the night, he cast an eye at 


HUNGER ON THE HOMESTRETCH 


145 



the thick cloud cover over the city. 
And damn me for being the kind of 
man who will do it again, if I can’t 
get the money any other way. 

Wednesday 

Swarms of people crowded the 
spotless streets, but Schwartz drifted 
through them like a leaf blown 
through a flock of pigeons. Driven 
by frustration, he bowled down the 
sidewalks, one eye searching for 
“help wanted” signs in store-front 
windows. Seventy-six dollars short. 
Sixty-three days to go. A mean, 
petty predicament. He could pay the 
rent and the bills, but starve. Or he 
could eat and pay the bills, but lose 
the room. Or he could pay the rent 
and eat for a few days, but then 
starve and lose the electricity. 

He had to find a job. He couldn’t 
stomach another mugging, not after 
the way he’d felt the previous night. 
But he had to hold the room, the 
electricity, and himself for sixty- 
three more days. He could go with- 
out food for the last period, that 
didn’t matter, because the first 
troops through the tunnel would be 
carrying rations, but he had to eat 
for the first fifty-some days. 

Ten blocks he had walked with- 
out seeing a single sign. God, what 
a lousy place to need a job. Un- 
employment at an all-time high, 
combined with rampaging cost-push 
inflation. If he could only switch 
apartments, find a smaller, cheaper 
place somewhere in Bedford- 
Stuyvesant ... but he couldn’t, be- 


cause the tunnel ended in his room. 

Scuffing his ripped shoes on a 
sidewalk just cleaned by one of 
New York’s legions of Sanitation 
Department welfare workers, he 
pondered alternatives: 

Begging. He could squat with an 
old tin can and hope that the hard- 
eyed passers-by would drop in 
enough money. Sixty-three days, 
humm, need about $1.38 a day to 
make it, and ' even then ... he 
rounded a corner and came upon a 
ragged row of beggars. While one 
of New York’s finest tried to break 
through their apathy and hustle 
them away, he remembered his cal- 
lous landlady saying that five or six 
were found dead, of exposure and/ 
or malnutrition, every morning. 
Wouldn’t work. If they, who 
showed the signs of Death Trium- 
phant in every stooped shoulder and 
beaten expression, couldn’t cajole 
survival money out of the citizenry, 
how could he, with his tremendous 
girth, even hope to? 

Welfare. He’d investigated that a 
week ago. The young social worker 
had been frankly despairing. With 
able-bodied welfare recipients lim- 
ited by statute to the number of 
people the city could actively 
employ, and with a waiting list of 
over fourteen thousand for the few 
spots that opened up every month, 
there was no possibility that the city 
could help him. Unless, added the 
nice- voiced lady, aged beyond her 
years by the strain of attempting the 
impossible, Mr. Schwartz suddenly 


146 


GALAXY 



developed a crippling infirmity — 
say, a missing eye? a hand severed 
above the wrist? — in which case the 
city would be allowed to assist him. 
Her own eyes, Schwartz had guessed 
as his stomach swung like a 
maddened gyroscope, had seen such 
things. He had thanked her, and 
left. But now, with the fifteen year 
old plan about to fall through be- 
cause of unforeseeable problems 
... he turned his collar against 
the damp bite of the wind. He could 
not afford to spend time in a hospi- 
tal because he had to prune the tun- 
nel every morning. If it weren’t 
kept clear, the interval between sol- 
diers would lengthen to much 
longer than the planned one second. 
And if it went untended for too 
long, Nature would reclaim its lost 
domain and the conquest could 
never take place. 

Mugging. He could try it again. 
Remorseless and implacable, he 
could venture into the — he shud- 
dered at the memory of flaccid 
flesh. Hand-to-hand combat against 
a determined foe on a battlefield is 
one thing. But to use it on a city 
street, to risk the death of an inno- 
cent individual. .and the damn 
city practically teemed with cops 
... he vowed there’ d be no en- 
core, unless it became absolutely 
essential. 

His face a contorted mask of fear 
and anger, he strode down the 
cheerless street. No jobs, no wel- 
fare, no begging, no mugging. The 
stream of people parted for him as 


the waters had for Moses, instinc- 
tively and inevitably. He scowled at 
the grey, worried faces that swept 
past, despising them and hoping 
that one would dare swirl into his 
path so that he might run it down. 
A pawn shop caught his eye and he 
hesitated, wondering if he had any- 
thing left. Then he sighed and went 
on. He had nothing but his couch, 
the clothes he was wearing, and the 
machine. The clothes he could mot 
do without, the couch had been con- 
temptuously spurned by the man 
who had purchased his bed and ta- 
bles, and the machine . without 
that, there was no sense to any- 
thing. 

If only he had seventy-six dol- 
lars . while his legs pumped 
mechanically, his mind wandered 
into the daydream it had been shap- 
ing since his arrival. The Day. The 
big machine, glowing and humming 
and occasionally spitting a polite lit- 
tle spark into the gathering dusk. 
Soldiers tumbling out of thin air 
into the living room, the first five 
moving lithely to long-determined 
guard posts. The next twenty carry- 
ing the pieces of the portable force- 
field generator. A momentary inter- 
ruption in the flow of tough, 
uniformed men as the engineers 
lifted and grunted and screwed and 
welded. Then the field is shimmer- 
ing and the building is invulnerable, 
so the flow begins again and the 
pool of daring commandos swells 
until it bursts through the front 
door. With the fury of unappeasable 


HUNGER ON THE HOMESTRETCH 


147 



flood waters, it sweeps the other 
tenants out onto the street, where 
they stand confused and sobbing. 
Hungry men with hair-trigger reac- 
tions lope down the stunned streets 
and expand the perimeter. Special 
teams roar off in commandeered ve- 
hicles for synchronized attacks on the 
nerve centers of the giant city — the 
telephone centers, and telegraph, 
and radio, and television. Others are 
racing to the bridges, to seal the is- 
land off. Finally, just as dawn is 
beginning to break, all the Consoli- 
dated Edison power plants are 
seized and New York is deprived of 
its electricity. The huge dynamos 
whirl only for the shining machine 
in his living room, which, in tan- 
dem with the one at the other end, 
begins to force back the electro- 
magnetic spatial-temporal walls and 
turn the narrow, one-man passage 
into a freeway large enough for the 
biggest bomber and the heaviest 
tank to travel side by side. 

Then, with the beachhead secured 
and reinforcements pouring in, all 
UN delegates are rounded up. A 
special meeting of the General As- 
sembly, televised to the world, at 
which Schwartz’s President and 
Commander-in-Chief appears and 
^^presents his non-negotiable de- 
mands: immediate cessation of all 
hostilities. Immediate unilateral dis- 
armament on Earth’s part. Im- 
mediate surrender of all nuclear 
weapons and other fissionable ma- 
terials, to be transported back to 
Schwartz’s world. Failing that, im- 

148 


mediate nuclear destruction of Mos- 
cow, Peking, Paris, London, and 
Washington, D.C. 

Earth would have no choice. It 
would promptly surrender and relin- 
quish its missiles and bombs. Once 
all nations were stripped, the politi- 
cal scientists back home assured 
everyone, no nation would consider 
building them again, because no na- 
tion would risk the invaders’ return. 

But how was he going to get the 
money? Seventy-six dollars. Didn’t 
the idiots on the other side realize 
that if he didn’t have it, the whole 
plan would collapse into nothing- 
ness? Why the hell didn’t they bust 
their asses to print up four more 
twenties, and shoot them through? 
Not for the first time, Schwartz 
cursed the rebellious competence 
which had brought about his exile 
to this god-forsaken land. If it 
hadn’t been for his talented arro- 
gance, if he hadn’t ignored their 
silly rule book and done things his 
way, they would be more sympathe- 
tic. Hah! They’d never have sent 
him: a good, obedient spy gets 
promoted into a cushy desk job. A 
maverick gets tougher and tougher 
assignments, until at last one of 
them kills him. 

God, the military mind confused 
him. Here he was, engaged in pre- 
paring for the most momentous 
event in the history of two worlds, 
and . but he wasn’t preparing. 
He raised his head and growled at a 
taxi cab which had had the temerity 
to hurry him with an impatient 


GALAXY 



beep. No, on this job, he wasn’t a 
commando, or even an agent. He 
was nothing but a highly-skilled 
janitor, sent to keep things clean 
and ready for use. 

He was back in his own 
neighborhood and the dingy front of 
the four-story brownstone in which 
he lived loomed up before him. He 
stood on the sidewalk a moment 
longer, shifting his weight from foot 
to foot, then grunted decisively and 
wheezed up the front steps. He’d 
call them again, by damn, and if 
they refused to come through, 
well . 

* ★ * 

Despite an unusually poor con- 
nection, the Duty Officer’s voice 
was like a steel blade on a frosty- 
morning. Wasting no time, it 
slashed at him: “You try my pa- 
tience, Schwartz. You were 
ordered — ” 

“1 know, I know,” protested the 
fat man warily, “but the situation 
here has become untenable, and 

if—” 

“Still the money, eh?” 

“Ja,” he muttered through 
clenched teeth. Unreasoning hatred 
of his superior flowed through him. 
Like a heady wine, it threw him off 
guard. But at the last moment, just 
before he began to spew forth his 
accumulated bitternesses, instinct 
stilled his tongue. 

“Impossible.” 

“Sir,” explained Schwartz, 


barely controlling himself, “without 
the money I lose the apartment, 
without which the invasion will fail. 
If you want — ” 

“Don’t be an ass, Schwartz. Ab- 
solutely nothing can be done.” 

“Sir, it’s only a — ” 

“First, we don’t have the 
facilities to counterfeit the money, 
remember? Second, the invasion of 
Alternate Right is now underway. 
Do you know how little power we 
have to spare? Even the energy we 
are using on this conversation is too 
much, and to send a packet would 
require ten times as much, if not 
more. And we don’t have it.” 

“But sir, the invasion wasn’t 
planned until — ” 

,“Don’t tell me what I told you. 
We jumped the gun because Alter- 
nate Right’s stepped-up nuclear 
testing was playing havoc with the 
Midwest. We had no choice; the 
Indianapolis area was getting burned 
too often. As was Shanhaikuan, in 
China.” 

“Does that,” mumbled Schwartz 
in confusion, “postpone the inva- 
sion here?” 

“So far.” replied the other, hu- 
manly uncertain for the first time, 
“it doesn’t seem that way, but we 
can’t be sure until perhaps a week 
in advance.” 

“And you can’t — ” 

“No!” barked the officer. His 
static-furred voice echoed off the 
bare walls. Schwartz trembled 
with sudden apprehension. “No 
more pleas. You are wasting time 


HUNGER ON THE HOMESTRETCH

and valuable energy. Find the 
money yourself. You are a talented 
agent. You can do it. Do you read 
me?” 

‘‘Ja, ja,” sighed Schwartz. “1 
read you, sir. Over and out.” 

”Roger, over and out.” 

Schwartz’s soft hand swept down 
the switches, then came to rest on 
his bent knee. Slowly, it formed a 
fist, and beat against the thick flesh 
of his thigh. The muffled thuds 
came faster and faster and faster un- 
til Schwartz suddenly jerked to his 
feet and shouted, “Goddamit- 
tohell!” 

Hands locked behind his back, he 
started pacing. The ancient boards 
of the warped floor squeaked at his 
passage, protesting his weight. 
Furious, he slammed his feet down, 
to crush all resistance from the 
wood. There was no other way he 
could obtain the money. None. 

+ * * 

He went prowling for another ben- 
efactor that night, in Manhattan, 
on the East Side. There, if luck 
rode with him, he would encounter 
someone whose wallet could make 
up the entire deficit and spare him a 
third assault. 

He found his mark in the 
shadows, reading a tattered poster 
on a building. He was a bare- 
headed, husky man in his late twen- 
ties. The smoothly-tailored lines of 
his long leather coat had probably 
run to at least $800; his shining 

150 


black boots looked like custom- 
made Italian imports. 

The harsh evening wind covered 
Schwartz’s rapid breath. His mouth 
opened. One swivel of his head as- 
sured him of privacy; he took four 
steps before a calm voice com- 
manded, “Fritz, defend!” 

Against a backdrop of late winter 
gloom gaped the slavering jaws of a 
huge Doberman pinscher. Back- 
drawn lips unsheathed long, yellow 
fangs; the tongue was a red carpet 
for a blood-curling snarl. 

Even as his conscious mind regis- 
tered the danger, the superbly 
trained body that slept under his 
flab awakened. His left hand came 
up, then waved to the left, drawing 
the dog’s eyes and turning the angle 
of the incoming jaw a few degrees. 
His stiffened right hand slashed at 
the middle of the dog’s long neck. 
Its vicious eyes glazed over as it 
slammed onto the sidewalk. It lay 
temporarily still, too stunned even 
to twitch. Two quick kicks finished 
it off and then Schwartz was on the 
owner. “Shouldn’t haff done that,” 
he growled, as savagely as the 
Doberman. “I coult haff been 
hurt.” His hand rose and fell and 
the young man dropped across the 
body of his late defender. 

Thursday 

Flushed by the first budgetary 
surplus he had seen in six months, 
Schwartz treated himself to a sirloin 
steak brunch at Schrafft’s. Washed 
down by generous helpings of 


GALAXY 



Heineken’s, the meal put him in 
such a genial mood that more of the 
dog-owner’s money went for a tip 
than he had planned. But he didn’t 
care; the billfold inside the Saville 
Row suit had been stuffed with $20 
bills. Schwartz had secreted enough 
in the couch to keep him in steak 
until The Day came. 

Ah, The Day. With Alternate 
Right being subdued now, the last 
threat to Center World would be 
removed in sixty-two days. Years 
and years of planning, of hiding, 
would have come to fruition. His 
world could rest easy, assured that 
there would be no. more hissing, 
melting discharges of wild energy. 

The first calamity had come some 
forty years earlier, when the center 
of Peshawar, one hundred miles 
west-north-west of Rawalpindi, had 
burned to the ground. It had been 
neither a gradual, spreading fire, 
not an explosion. It was as though 
every ramshackle hut had been satu- 
rated in gasoline, and simul- 
taneoulsy torched. The scientists, 
the fire investigators, the survi- 
vors — all had thrown up their 
hands and put it down to the whims 
of a mad God. Three days later a 
like fire had killed ten thousand in 
Miram Shah, two hundred miles 
west-south-west of Rawalpindi. For 
years suspicion rested on Hindu 
fanatics. But then similar things 
happened near Moscow, and later 
between Ankara and Istanbul, and 
his world had edged to the brink of 
war. 


After frowning for so long, for- 
tune decided to smile. A German 
scientist promulgated a theory, con- 
firmed by tests carried out in Tur- 
key, deep in the Pacific, and again 
near Moscow. Somewhere else, not 
on his world but near it, wild 
energy was burning holes through 
walls which no one had known 
were there. 

The scientist postulated that alter- 
nate worlds existed, but were sepa- 
rated by space-time barriers. He 
went on to suggest that when 
sources of tremendous energy, such 
as nuclear weapons, expended them- 
selves in one sudden burst, the bar- 
riers were warped open. He pre- 
dicted that they would quickly knit 
themselves back together, but not 
before passing disastrous floods of 
energy. 

Through perseverance and 
chance, leading physicists were fi- 
nally able to observe one such 
flood. Their theories sent a 
thousand engineers scurrying to 
duplicate the process with less ener- 
gy. In time, they found it. A minute 
atomic bomb cracked the walls; an 
engineer-cum-agent slipped into the 
next world. He, in turn, made his 
way to New York, and over a 
period of years pieced together a 
device for establishing contact. The 
scientists on the other side, alert for 
his signal, rushed their own equip- 
ment to the site of the temporary 
warp and established the beginnings 
of the tunnel. 

Once the first tunnel became a 


HUNGER ON THE HOMESTRETCH 


151 



going operation, another was in- 
stalled to link Center World and 
Alternate Right, whose atomic tests 
were also wreaking havoc. Contact 
established and institutionalized, 
Center World, desperate for securi- 
ty, began plotting the conquest of 
two other worlds. 

The Eastern Alliance was given 
charge of conquering Alternate 
Right, the world now in the process 
of being subdued. Schwartz smiled 
into the brilliant winter sunlight as 
he thought of the Moscow and Pek- 
ing hordes swarming through that 
other Moscow. Just as his own 
forces would overrun this city in 
only sixty-two days. 

Ah, he thought, how wonderful it 
will be, to live without the fear of 
suddenly learning that you uncle's 
hometown has been vaporized by 
the waste energy of a pointless nu- 
clear test. How wonderful it will be 
to close up shop here and return to 
my own world, a place of sanity 
and peace. 

Lost in dreams, and dulled by the 
unaccustomed richness of his 
brunch, he failed to notice the sharp 
glance of a passing man. He turned 
into his street, still unaware that the 
other was combing the area for a 
policeman. He didn’t even hear the 
excited voice shrill, “That’s him, 
officer. That’s the man who 
mugged me and killed my dog!” 

The policeman’s deep heartiness 
finally penetrated his cloud. “Hold 
on there, now sir. I’d like to have a 
word with you, if I may.” 


“Pardon?” He turned and 
blinked, and in that instant saw the 
well-dressed young man behind the 
protective bulk of the policeman. 
Before his conscious mind could 
begin to react, long years of train- 
ing took command. His left foot 
snapped up, into the patrolman’s 
stomach. As he dropped, Schwartz 
ran. Behind him arose a furious 
scream: “Stop that man! Stop him 
he’s a thief! Stctp him!!!” 

Passers-by leaped for safety as 
Schwartz barreled down the 
sidewalk. Driven by one thought, 
that he should warn his superiors 
that all hell was breaking loose, he 
made no effort to approach his 
building by a roundabout route. He 
ran directly up the front steps and 
burst like a whirlwind into the tiny 
lobby. Panting heavily, moving too 
hastily, he had to try twice before 
he could fit his key into the lock. 
Police whistles were blowing just 
behind him by the time he got the 
door open. 

“Stop or I’ll shoot,” boomed a 
voice over the rumble of cars and 
the beeping of horns. Pedestrians 
added cries of alarm, concern, and 
curiosity to the general din. “Stop, 
dammit!” 

Ignoring the cacophony, Schwartz 
began to swing the heavy front door 
shut. From the street came the bark 
of an automatic. He staggered back, 
clapping his hand to his chest. A 
low roar of satisfaction rose from 
the crowd that had already gathered. 
The policeman, still winded, hob- 


152 


GALAXY 



bled slowly up the steps; he was not 
prepared to see Schwartz appear 
again, to close the door. The cop 
took the last four steps at gut- 
wrenching speed, and pounded 
futilely on the indifferent wood. 
“Open up in there,” he shouted, 
“open up, this is the police.” 

Inside, Schwartz gasped for air 
and began the climb. The pain in 
his withered lungs was frightening. 
He would have preferred to sit 
quietly and wait for the police, but 
the youth he had once been refused. 
Grunting, he pressed a handkerchief 
over the wound with his left hand 
while he clung to the bannister with 
his right. The stairs were steep and 
narrow. He told himself that he 
couldn’t possibly mount them, but 
his body responded to orders laid 
down fifteen years earlier and one 
time-space wall away: never die 
without first reporting it. 

The muscles in his legs 
weakened; his arms and shoulders 
took on the extra burden. He 
coughed, and almost lost his bal- 
ance when a fine spray of blood 
splattered against the faded yellow 
wallpaper. Only by closing his eyes 
was he able to resist the sudden 
dizziness, to continue to the top. 

As quickly as his tortured body 
would permit, he closed and locked 
his door. With his last reserves of 
strength and willpower, he shuffled 
across the floor. Puddles of crimson 
on the dusty boards bore mute tes- 
timony to the nature of his wound. 

At the transmitter, he peered 

HUNGER ON THE HOMESTRETCH 


through a haze of pain. His trem- 
bling fingers found the switches, 
groped for the microphone, and 
found that. He was speaking in 
staccato bursts, oblivious to the 
furious voice from the other end. 

‘‘Schwartz here . I’ve been 
shot . police about to — to arrest 
me . matter of minutes . dy- 
ing . get replacement here 
quick ...” 

Awkawardly, he thumbed a row 
of buttons labeled ‘‘Matter Re- 
ceive.” As he staggered to the 
couch, an efficient voice replied, 
“Five minutes, Schwartz, hold on 
for just five minutes and we’ll have 
a man there to help you. Just keep 
the police away for five minutes, 
ja?” The final note was pleading. A 
faint smile formed on Schwartz’s 
thick lips, to be frozen there by the 
chill approach of death. 

But before two minutes had 
passed the cops were outside his 
apartment door; the landlady had fi- 
nally been roused by their tumult. 
Angry, heaving shoulders splintered 
the flimsy plywood and an instant 
later they stood over his cooling 
corpse. The youngest, a rookie 
fresh out of the police academy, 
was surprised by Schwartz’s pleased 
expression. “Look at that, willya?” 
he demanded of his partner. “The 
guy actually looks relieved.” 

“Why not?” shrugged the older 
patrolman, still nursing his bruised 
stomach. “He prolly knew his wor- 
ries were over, huh?” 

“Yeah, I guess so.” Hands on 

153 



hips, he scanned the aching empti- 
ness. “Helluva place to die, that’s 
for sure.” 

“Any place is,” grunted the sec- 
ond. 

“Hey, he left his machine, on. 
Should I turn it off?” 

The older man frowned, thought, 
and shook his head, “Nah, leave it 
on till the lieutenant gets here. You 
know how he hates for us to mess 
with stuff.” 

“Screw your lieutenant!” bel- 
lowed the landlady as she stormed 
into the room. Clearly outraged by 
the destruction of the door, she shot 
Schwartz a murderous glance. It 
weakened only when she realized he 
was dead. Her blonde hair fluttered 
as she seethed with frustration. 
“Screw your lieutenant,” she re- 
peated, with less violence but more 
conviction. “If Schwartz isn’t going 
to be around to pay the bill, his 
damn radio goes off!” Wheeling to 
face the great transmitter, she 
reached down and yanked the heavy 
plug from the wall. The little green 
lights went dark. “There!” As she 
sailed out, slightly mollified by her 
last gesture of contempt, the two 
cops looked at each other. 

“Should I plug it back in, Joe?” 
asked the rookie in an anxious tone. 

“Nah,” said the patrolman. He 
sat gingerly on the arm of the 
couch, less then eight inches from 
Schwartz’s triumphant smile. “We 
just don’t tell the lieutenant it was 
on. What he don’t know won’t hurt 
him.” ★

Dear Dr. Poumelle: 

I was very interested to read your article 
on the “Lovecraftian universe.” 

“The most merciful thing in the world,” I 
thought to myself, “is the inability of the 
human mind to correlate all its contents. We 
live on a placid island of ignorance in the 
midst of black seas of infinity, and it was 
not meant that we should voyage far. The 
sciences, each straining in its own direction, 
have hitherto harmed us little; but some day 
the piecing together of dissociated knowledge 
will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, 
and of our frightful position therein, that we 
shall either go mad from the revelation or 
flee from the deadly light into the peace and 
safety of a new dark age.” 

Or, in fine, ‘‘So ph’nglui mglw’nafh 
Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl really fhtagn!” 
Well, you can’t say you all weren’t 
warned. 

Yours truly,

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Enclosed is a carbon copy of the letter I 


have sent to the following members of 
congress: Jacob K. Javits, Charles Rangel, 
Edward I. Koch, Lester Wolfe, Otis Pike, 
Bella Abzug, Elizabeth Holtzman, Hermann 
Badillo, Joseph Addabbo, Benjamin 
Rosenthal, James H. Scheuer, Shirley

Solarz. 

1 have also sent copies of Jerry Poumelle’s 
letter to some friends in New Mexico, one of 
whom owns some 800 acres which he might 
want to plant with jojoba. 

Also, I have made arrangements to present 
the idea at the next meeting of the Policy 
Committee of the Liberal Party of New York 
State, where I have every reason to expect it 
to be accepted without opposition. This 
would mean that candidates for Congress 
seeking the Liberal nomination (which 
includes those mentioned above, and others) 
would have some additional impetus to 
support such legislation. 

I intend in the near future to write to 
members of Congress from the Southwestern 
Slates, with a copy of Jerry Poumelle’s letter 
for each of them. 

Please forward the enclosed carbon copy 
of this letter to Jerry Poumelle; I think he, 
too, would be interested in this result of his 
letter. Thank you.

The Honorable Shirley Chisholm 
House Office Building 
Washington, D. C. 

Dear Ms. Chisholm: 

Enclosed is a copy of a letter to the editor 
of Galaxy magazine, which presents a 
suggestion which I most heartily endorse. 

Although the most immediate and direct 
benefits of Mr. Poumelle’s proposal would 


DIRECTIONS 


155 



accrue to the part of United States most 
geographically distant from New York, the 
proposed project would benefit the human 
race as a whole, not. just those of a few 
states. 

But the most compelling arguments may 
well be two that Mr. Pournelle does not 
mention directly in his letter to Galaxy: 1. 
The favorable effect on our international 
balance of payments; and 2. The honor that 
would accrue to the United States as a 
nation. 

I submit that at a time when our City and 
State are being attacked by petty politicians 
from certain other States in the hope of 
grubbing a few votes, your authorship and 
sponsorship of legislation to subsidize the 
cultivation of jojoba would be a gesture in 
the finest tradition of our City and State; an 
outstanding example of your and our concern 
for the needs of everyone, not just our own 
parochial concerns. (Not that New York 
wouldn’t benefit: where else would most of 
the stocks of jojoba oil refining companies 
and other associated industries be traded? 
Would none of the oil itself pass thru the 
Port of New York? Or is it likely that none 
of the insurance business generated would be 
underwritten by New York insurance 
companies? 1 am quite sure that significant 
material benefits would in fact find their way 
to New York City and New York State.) 

I am sure you know far better than I what 
political capital you might be able to gather 
in the process. 

Thank you for your consideration of this 
important matter. 

Sincerely, 
Bret Hooper 

Since its appearance in the September ' 75 issue 
of Galaxy Jerry's " Feature Letter ” on the in- 
terchangeability of jojoba and sperm oil has 
generated a remarkably intense response from 
diverse sectors of the political spectrum; it’s 
beginning to look like Galaxy and its readership 
may be playing a significant role in saving a 
possibly intelligent and certainly magnificent 
species from extinction. See page 163 (inside- 
back cover), where the letter has been reprinted 


in its entirety — to add fuel to the fire. 
Hmmm. .whoever could have guessed that 
one day there might be a ' ‘Pournelle Plank’ ’ in 
the Liberal Party Platform. (Dr. Pournelle has \ 
promised me Summary Execution if I even v 
suggest that his name be so intimately linked 
with the Liberal Cause; I therefore mention it 
only as a possibility. .) 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

Poul Anderson’s piece in the September 
“Forum” was the most inreresting I’ve read 
on the topic of interstellar travel lately. I was 
glad to see that he Qualified the idea that we 
can reach the stars with the statement, “If 
we have the will.”; that’s a mighty big 
“If”. 

Collectively (as a country, or as the 
human race) we don’t even have the will to 
reach the planets, much less the stars; ~and 1 
don’t think we will for a long time. 
Evidently, Americans prefer to let their tax 
dollars be spent on "... bureaucrats, 
subsidies to inefficient businesses, or the 
servicing of the national debt . (et 
al) — and to Hell with any benefits from 
space exploration. 

Though it’s going to take longer than it 
should, I’m confident we’ll make it to the 
stars. 

Romantic notions have a habit of becom- 
ing concrete reality, given time.

reader-dom and writer-dom that have the 
inside dope on what science fiction ought 
and ought not to be are only slightly less 
prolific than the mosquito, and just about as 
beneficial. “Give us some rouno 
characters!” some cry. ‘‘Some symbolism, 
allusion, imagery, a message!” Others retort, 
“The hell with all that college educated 
stuff. We want action, plot, sense of 
wonder." Still others wonder, “Why all the 
swearing and screwing?” Well, I have an 
idea. Why not take all that rot, compile it 
into one EXHAUSTING volume, and call it 
Much Ado Aboil! Nothing? (Aw, shucks, I 
think somebody used that title already. 
Maybe we could shove it down a black 
hole?) 

There is no instant formula for writing a 
story, science fiction or otherwise. It is not 
like writing an essay exam, where you plug 
in the magic ingredients and bullshit the rest. 
You cannot make every story profoundly 
philosophical, great grandiose scenes ar? not 
always necessary, and you do not have to 
swear just for the hell of it. Oh, sure, a 
writer has to be aware of his readers, but he 
must also be true to himself. Preoccupation 
with making a story fit a certain style has got 
to interfere with the creative process. There 
are probably good writers, right now, 
frustrated with that very thing. 

So, why not give a guy a break? Don’t go 
calling him a bleep because you don’t like 
his style. (Maybe he doesn’t like yours.) To 
limit the scope of SF is to limit its 
possibilities. Give a little slack. You might 
be surprised.

Dear Jim, 

Helium was a most intriguing story. (1 
wonder where you discovered Arsen Darnay; 

I haven’t seen his byline anywhere else.) 
And insanities such as “Elephant with 
Wooden Leg” are a break to see. You 
certainly are going in new directions with 
Galaxy'. 


Also, I feel that Jerry Poumelle is the 
equal of Asimov in covering science — 
though I can imagine the Good Doctor 
saying bunk on UFOs — and his story-telling 
is on a level with the good years of Heinlein. 
In a way we should be thankful that the 
space program lost him.

Arsen’s first story was found lurking in what 
we fondly if perhaps inelegantly refer to as 
the “ slushpile .” His second story was not 
unsolicited. Since his ", discovery " Arsen has 
sold a novel to Ballantine and stories to that 
Certain Other magazine, and of course he 
has been represented many times in Galaxy. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I recently wrote to another science fiction 
magazine, the one that used to live on a 
formula of brilliant engineers versus govt, 
bureaucrats, mindless mobs of students, and 
other criminals. (Sometimes the good guys 
were business bureaucrats, police, or military 
bureaucrats. The magazine is now off the 
bottle but regresses when hungry.) Their 
reviewer put down Mote in God’s Eye 
because he thought the characters were too 
stereotyped. 1 patiently explained how the 
collapse of the First Empire had put selective 
pressure on humanity, making the resulting 
characters a little overspecialized, becoming 
more like the Moties. The Editor sent me a 
note telling me the characters were too 
stereotyped. 

Now you’re planning an article on the 
Mote by the authors. They might like to 
know that somebody understands.

Dear Mr. Baen. 

This is just a fan letter for the greatest

DIRECTIONS 



thing you have published since you took over 
Galaxy. Inferno is far ahead of Love 
Conquers All and Orbitsville, even ahead of 
Sign of the Unicorn and The Company of 
Glory. You have published a classic. 

And you have also turned SF upside 
down. You have published a religious SF 
story that is also action/adventure. From now 
on, the rest will have to measure up. You 
have treated what is possibly the biggest 
no-no of them all. You have printed a story 
that has things to say about SF now — but 
which will be a classic forever. 

What I’m trying to say is that Larry and 
Jerry have made SF a whole new ball game, 
and have stuck meticulously to Dante in the 
bargain. For example where Dante made 
comments on politics, J & L made comments 
on science fiction. And such a plausible job 
of modernizing Hell, too! Darned if you 
don’t have half of fandom reading Dante. 
Got me, for one. If those guys don’t win a 
Hugo, a Nebula, a John W. Campbell 
Memorial Award, an International Fantasy 
Award, and a Tolkien Memorial Award for 
this, the whole thing will have been rigged.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

If you don’t publish this letter, please pass 
it on to Messrs. Niven & Poumeile to let

Inferno. I reread Dante simultaneously, and 
found it increased my enjoyment of both the 
medieval and the modern treatments. 
Niven/Pournelle provide a “damn” good 
commentary on Dante, & vice versa. 

On the strength of Inferno, I have entered 
a subscription with your Subscription Dept. 
Of course, I dare not hope for a sequel, in 
which Niven & Pournelle would follow 
Benito or Allen up through Purgatorio-

Dear Baen, 

Just want to take a moment, or two, or 
three, to let you know how your 
communications are faring, the effects 
created. .on this reader. 

Oddly enough, I have only been reading 
SF mags for about, oh, two years. I got 
hooked on SF fifteen years ago at my 
hometown library which boasted mainly of 
Asimov, Bradbury and damned little else. 

After living in L.A. for a couple of years, 
I suddenly discovered these little books with 
the colorful covers. I had read about five 
issues of IF before it submerged, so I didn’t 
feel much of a loss. 

Currently I can afford four mags a month 
and this is how I rate them; 

1. Galaxy 

2. Fantastic 

3. Amazing - 

4. Fantasy and Science Fiction 

Your mag started at the bottom. Working 
upwards was gradual and my opinions are 
based on; a) entertainment quality, b) 
writer's ability c) editorial personality, d) 
overall tone of the mag. 

One by one, if you’ll bear with me: 

A, You present a great variety of stories. 
Poetic, serious and funniernhell. I enjoy 
almost all of your selections, to a greater 
degree than #3 and 4, tho I wish you could 
branch off into deeper fantasy on occasion. 
Consider that a suggestion, not a complaint. 

B, The stories are consistently well 
written, even the ones I don’t like for 
content, such as Hammer’s Slammers. The 
other mags often provide extremely well 
crafted pieces. .with a lack of simple 
entertainment. 

C, As I have stated in previous letters, I 
back you 100% in your efforts at uptone, 
positive ideas. Especially some of these 
cyclical solutions you have presented. Also I 
enjoy the affinity that comes out between 
you and the people you work with.

GALAXY 



D. Take Geis and Spider. They are both 
refreshing as a heady whiff of Lysol. Both 
cogent (in their off moments), funny and 
damned nice to read. 1 think they carry out 
very well the overall tone of your mag and 
one which fits in with my tastes just 
perfectly. 

But what has brought you to the top of the 
list is not any one item. It is the combination 
of the four, so, Baen. .thanks a whole, 
big bunch!!!! Oh, jeez! I also love your 
artists, especially the Dalzellian panda.

An Open Letter to the Readers of Galaxy : 

i A recent Galaxy Forum piece by Fred Pohl showed how a set of problems can be 
made to solve each other. I think I’ve found another of those snake-balls that will 
proceed to untangle themselves once we’ve taken the first steps — and since my let- 
ter on tuna fishing and dolphins elicited such an intense response, I thought you 
might like to bring this matter to the attention of Galaxy' s readership as well. 

The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whales; it reaches a maximum 
length of 60 feet, and is the only cetacean (indeed, the only living animal) with a 
throat large enough to admit a man. It is also the source of ambergris. [Also, it is 
not impossible that the sperm whale is as intelligent as homo sapiens. Ed.] Unless 
we do something, the species will be extinct within ten years. 

The sperm whale is in trouble because of its spermaceti organ, a rather mysteri- 
ous thing in its head that carries about a ton of whale oil. No one knows what it 
does for the whale — but we find it quite valuable; the US could use 50 million 
pounds of it per year, or 25 thousand whales’ worth. 

Of course we no longer buy sperm oil. The Marine Mammals Protection Act 
quite rightly forbids importation of all whale-derived products. Good as far as it 
goes, but not enough to save the whales; Japanese and Soviet whalers go right on 
killing, and there’s a ready market for every available drop of sperm oil. 

That’s problem one, then: saving the sperm whale from extinction. 

Problem two: severe unemployment in our Southwestern deserts. 

Dual solution: those same Southwestern deserts, Indian Reservation land, mostly, 
can be made to produce 200 pounds of sperm oil per- acre per-year. 

You see, there’s this scruffy-looking plant called the jojoba (pronounced ho- 
HO-ba) that grows wild in the Sonora and southwards, and the seeds of this shrub 
turn out to be composed of about 50% of an oil nearly identical to that of the 
sperm whale— certainly near enough so for industrial uses. 

A recent study by the National Research Council shows how planting 400 acres 
in jojoba each year for the next five years will ultimately provide an annual yield of 
a half million pounds of sperm oil indefinitely. The initial cultivation and refining 
will need Federal subsidies — but the major costs will be salaries for people at pre- 
sent unemployed — who will then become taxpayers. 

So. A viable industry in a high-unemployment area, and sufficiency in sperm oil. 
So far so good; but I recommend we go much further. 

Why not plant a lot of jojoba? The cost of subsidizing the cultivation of several 
thousand acres of the stuff can’t be large compared to the millions of acres of to- 
bacco for which we pay subsidies. Why not grow enough jojoba to sell the oil 
cheap on the world market; so cheap that there’s no profit in killing sperm whales. 

The benefits — alleviating unemployment, sufficiency in sperm oil, and saving a 
species from extinction — seem well worth the cost. Normally I do not recommend 
government subsidies; in this case I'll swallow my theoretical objections. I’ve writ- 
ten my Congressman about it. Care to join me?

How the Club works: 

When your application for membership is accept- 
ed, you’ll receive your introductory package of 4 
books. (If you also want the record, check the ap- 
propriate box in the coupon below.) If not com- 
pletely satisfied, you may return this introductory 
package in ten days’ time — membership will be 
cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we'll 
send you the Club’s bulletin, describing the 2 com- 
ing Selections and a variety of Alternate choices. 
If you want both Selections, you need do nothing; 
they’ll be shipped automatically. If you don't want 
a Selection, or prefer an Alternate, or no book at 
all, just fill out the convenient form always pro- 
vided, and return it by the date specified. We try to 
allow you at least ten days for making your deci- 
sion. If you don’t get the form in time to respond 
within 10 days, and receive unwanted books, you 
may return them at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selections or 
Alternates during the coming year. You may resign 
any time thereafter, or remain a member as long as 
you wish. At least one of the two Selections each 
month is only $1.98 plus shipping and handling. 
Other extra-value selections are slightly higher but 
always much less than Publishers’ Editions. Send 
no money. But do send the coupon today.
