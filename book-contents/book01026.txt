I^OT very long ago, debunk- 

’ ers were about as numerous 
as bison. Now, in only a couple 
of decades, they’ve become al- 
most extinct and should be given 
Federal protection. 

It’s a pity that the breed is 
vanishing. They did no harm, for 
anything valid that stood in their 
way was not toppled by their 
trampling rush, and they did 
uproot a stupendous amount of 
societal rubbish that we’re bet- 
ter off without. 

Well, at . least we still have 
Bergen Evans, a very happy bi- 
son indeed, whose The Spoor of 
Spooks (Knopf) is a joyous romp 
through the lush fields of “scien- 
tific” nonsense. 

Charles Fort would have used 
this rich book as another ax in 
his crusade, being faster on the 
drawing of conclusions than the 
researchers he was lambasting. 
Evans is just as quick to demolish 
irrational belief, even though he 
quotes Shaw on the law of the 
conservation of credulity: “the 
dispelling of one illusion seems 
to create a vacuum which draws 
in another.” And Evans is as un- 
able as Fort to resist overstate- 



ment, ridicule and outrageous 
puns. 

Nevertheless, both are fine 
sources of ideas. I wish I could 
explore The Spoor of Spooks 
more fully than these two pages 
allow — ^Evans takes on every- 
thing from dowsing to idiocies in 
the law — but one chapter is es- 
pecially important in view of a 
thematic trend in science fiction. 

Evans calls it “Psi-ing in the 
Carolines” — I warned you about 
his puns — and his target for to- 
night is Dr. Joseph B. Rhine of 
Duke University, the champion 
of extra-sensory perception and 
psychokinesis. 

For years now. I’ve been wait- 
ing sympathetically for good 
news from Durham, N. C. Let 
Evans tell you why there hasn’t 
been any: 

“The existence of Psi has 
chiefly been determined, to the 
satisfaction of those who believe 
in it, by the fact that certain 
people have allegedly at certain 
times identified certain cards 
slightly more often than certain 
other people believe constitutes 
chance expectancy . He (Dr. 
Rhine) does not claim that his 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



best performers can demonstrate 
ESP at will, but only that they 
have demonstrated it .36 or .23 
‘above chance’; and he must 
surely know that, under the cir- 
cumstances l;e describes, truly 
scientific experimenters would 
make an allowance of that much 
or more for error of record.” 
Incidentally, the cards used 
are not normal decks; there are 
25 special cards in five suits. 
This gives the subject a one-in- 
five chance at each guess. 

Evans insists that a norm 
should be established by giving 
tests to large numbers of people. 
Then the exceptional person 
should be tested ‘‘until the re- 
sults are stable, no longer al- 
tered by additional experiments. 
Then, and then only, can the 
tester be sure that he has estab- 
lished a difference between the 
individual and the group,” 

But Rhine won’t do that, any 
more than he has agreed to in- 
tersperse blank cards in his spe- 
cial deck, claiming that ‘‘this 
would be a form of deception.” 
When “promising” subjects be- 
gin slipping, he breaks off the 
experiment. But he keeps the 
positive findings as “evidence!” 
Evans’ appropriate comment 
is that, still better than winning 
at dice by quitting when you’re 
ahead, “It would be even easier 
if you didn’t have to play for 
keeps until you started to win 



and were allowed to ignore some 
of your bad runs because they 
weren’t up to normal!” 

Rhine claims that most scien- 
tists believe he has proved the 
existence of Psi. But “hundreds 
of thousands of tests have been 
made with his own cards without 
finding anyone who could guess 
them more accurately than 
chance expectancy would indi- 
cate.” 

It’s true that “Those who be- 
live in Psi . forget the prophe- 
cies that don’t come true, the 
premonitions that prove ground- 
less . The ultimate test of the 
validity of any experiment is that 
those who repeat it will get the 
same result.” 

Yes — once method and tools 
are found. Fire, for example, was 
used long before Man knew how 
to make it. Not being able to 
make it didn’t mean there was 
no such thing. 

Evans hasn’t proved his point 
any more than Rhine has. Like 
Flying Saucers, there’s something 
there. We don’t know what, but 
neither can we dismiss it by de- 
bunking tactics alone. 

Whatever it is, though. Dr. 
Rhine’s odd approach is more 
likely to obscure than locate it. 
A dismal fact, for we’d like it to 
be otherwise, but, to be entirely 
practical, we’d do well to look 
elsewhere for the latest news on 
Psi. — H. L. GOLD

T he chief of protocol said, 
“Mr. Hudson of — ah — 
Mastodonia.” 

The secretary of state held out 
his hand. “I’m glad to see you, 
Mr. Hudson. I understand you’ve 
been here several times.”

“That’s right,” said Hudson. 
“I had a hard time making your 
people believe I was in earnest.” 
“And are you, Mr. Hudson?” 
“Believe me, sir, I would not 
try to fool you.” 

“And this Mastodonia,” said 
the secretary, reaching down to 
tap the document upon the desk. 
“You will pardon me, but I’ve 
never heard of it.” 

“It’s a new nation,” Hudson 
explained, “but quite legitimate. 
We have a constitution, a demo- 
cratic form of government, duly 
elected officials and a code of 
laws. We are a free, peace-loving 
people and we are possessed of a 
vast amount of natural resources 
and — ” 

“Please tell me, sir,” interrupt- 
ed the secretary, “just where are 
you located?” 

“Technically, you are our 
nearest neighbors.” 

“But that is ridiculous!” ex- 
ploded Protocol. 

“Not at all,” insisted Hudson. 
“If you will give me a moment, 
Mr. Secretary, I have consider- 
able evidence.” 

He brushed the fingers of Pro- 
tocol off his sleeve and stepped 
forward to the desk, laying down 
the portfolio he carried. 

“Go ahead, Mr. Hudson,” said 
the secretary. “Why don’t we all 
sit down and be comfortable 
while we talk this over?” 

“You have my credentials, I

see. Now here is a propos — ” 

“I have a document signed by 
a certain Wesley Adams.” 

“He’s our first president,” said 
Hudson. “Our George Washing- 
ton, you might say.” 

“What is the purpose of this 
visit, Mr. Hudson?” 

“We’d like to establish diplo- 
matic relations. We_ think it 
would be to our mutual benefit. 
After all, we are a sister republic 
in perfect sympathy with your 
policies and aims. We’d like to 
negotiate trade agreements and 
we’d be grateful for some Point 
Four aid.” 

The secretary smiled. “Nat- 
urally. Who doesn’t?” 

“We’re prepared to offer some- 
thing in return,” Hudson told 
him stiffly. “For one thing, we 
could offer sanctuary.” 
“Sanctuary!” 

“I understand,” said Hudson, 
“that in the present state of inter- 
national tensions, a foolproof 
sanctuary is not something to be 
sneezed at.” 

The secretary turned stone 
cold. “I’m an extremely busy 
man.” 

Protocol took Hudson firmly 
by the arm. “Out you go.” 

G eneral Leslie Bowers put 
in a call to State and got the 
secretary. 

“I don’t like to bother you. 
Herb,” he said, “but there’s 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



something I want to check. May- 
be you can help me.” 

“Glad to help you if I can.” 
“There’s a fellow hanging 
around out here at the Pentagon, 
trying to get in to see me. Said I 
was the only one he’d talk to, but 
you know how it is.” 

“I certainly do.” 

“Name of Huston or Hudson 
or something like that.” 

“He was here just an hour or so 
ago,” said the secretary. “Crack- 
pot sort of fellow.” 

“He’s gone now?” 

“Yes. I don’t think he’ll be 
back.” 

“Did he say where you could 
reach him?” 

“No, I don’t believe he did.” 
“How did he strike you? I 
mean what kind of impression 
did you get of him?” 

“I told you. A crackpot.” 

“I suppose he is. He said some- 
thing to one of the colonels that 
got me worrying. Can’t pass up 
an3Tthing, you know — not in the 
Dirty Tricks Department. Even 
if it’s crackpot, these days you 
got to have a look at it.” 

“He offered sanctuary,” said 
the secretary indignantly. “Can 
you imagine that!” 

“He’s been making the rounds, 
I guess,” the general said. “He 
was over at AEC. Told them 
some sort of tale about knowing 
where there were vast uranium 
deposits. It was the AEC that 



told me he was heading your 
way.” 

“We get them all the time. 
Usually we can ease them out. 
This Hudson was just a little bet- 
ter than the most of them. He got 
in to see me.” 

“He told the colonel something 
about having a plan that would 
enable us to establish secret bases 
an5^here we wished, even in the 
territory of potential enemies. I 
know it sounds crazy . .” 

“Forget it, Les.” 

“You’re probably right,” said 
the general, “but this idea sends 
me. Can you imagine the look on 
their Iron Curtain faces?” 

^^HE scared little government 
clerk, darting conspiratorial 
glances all about him, brought 
the portfolio to the FBI. 

“I found it in a bar down the 
street,” he told the man who took 
him in tow. “Been going there 
for years. And I found this port- 
folio laying in the booth. I saw 
the man who must have left it 
there and I tried to find him 
later, but I couldn’t.” 

“How do you know he left it 
there?” 

“I just figured he did. He left 
the booth just as I came in and 
it was sort of dark in there and 
it took a minute to see this thing 
laying there. You see, I always 
take the same booth every day 
and Joe sees me come in and he

brings me the usual and — ” 
“You saw this man leave the 
booth you usually sit in?” 
“That’s right;” 

“Then you saw the portfolio.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“You tried to find the man, 
thinking it must have been his.” 
“That’s exactly what I did.” 
“But by the time you went to 
look for him, he had disap- 
peared.” 

“That’s the way it was.” 

“Now tell me — ^why did ybu 
bring it here? Why didn’t you 
turn it in to the management so 
the man could come back and 
claim it?” 

“Well, sir, it was like this. I 
had a drink or two and I was 
wondering all the time what was 
in that portfolio. So finally I took 
a peek and — ” 

“And what you saw decided 
you to bring it here to us.” 
“That’s right. I saw — ” 

“Don’t tell me what you saw. 
Give me your name and address 
and don’t say anything about 
this. You understand that we’re 
grateful to you for thinking of 
us, but we’d rather you said noth- 
ing.” 

“Mum’s the word,” the little 
clerk assured him, full of vast 
importance. 

The FBI phoned Dr. Ambrose 
Amberly, Smithsonian expert on 
paleontology. 

“We’ve got something. Doctor, 



that we’d like you to have a look 
at. A lot of movie film.” 

“I’ll be most happy to. I’ll 
come down as soon as I get clear. 
End of the week, perhaps?” 

“This is very urgent. Doctor. 
Damnest thing you ever saw. 
Big, shaggy elephants and tigers 
with teeth down to their necks. 
There’s a beaver the size of a 
bear.” 

“Fakes,” said Amberly, dis- 
gusted. “Clever gadgets. Camera 
angles.” 

“That’s what we thought first, 
but there are no gadgets, no cam- 
era angles. This is the real Mc- 
Coy.” 

“I’m on my way,” the paleon- 
tologist said, hanging up.

II 

PRESIDENT Wesley Adams 
and Secretary of State John 
Cooper sat glumly under a tree 
in the capital of Mastodonia and 
waited for the ambassador ex- 
traordinary to return. 

“I tell you, Wes,” said Cooper, 
who, under various pseudonyms, 
was also the secretaries of com- 
merce, treasury and war, “this is 
a crazy thing we did. What if 
Chuck can’t get back? They 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



might throw him in jail or some- 
thing might happen to the time 
unit or the helicopter. We should 
have gone along.” 

“We had to stay,” Adams said. 
“You know what would happen 
to this camp and our supplies if 
we weren’t around here to guard 
them.” 

“The only thing that’s given us 
any trouble is that old mastodon. 
If he comes around again, I’m 
going to take a skillet and bang 
him in the brisket.’'’ 

“That isn’t the only reason, 
either,” said President Adams, 
“and you know it. We can’t go 
deserting this nation now that 
we’ve created it. We have to keep 
possession. Just planting a flag 
and saying it’s ours wouldn’t be 
enough. We might be called upon 
for proof that we’ve established 
residence. Something like the old 
homestead laws, you know.” 
“We’U establish residence sure 
enough,” growled Secretary 
Cooper, “if something happens to 
that time imit or the helicopter.” 
“You think they’ll do it, 
Johnny?” 

“Who do what?” 

“The United States. Do you 
think they’ll recognize us?” 

“Not if they know who we are.” 
“That’s what I’m afraid of.” 
“Chuck will talk them into it. 
He can talk the skin right off a 
cat.” 

“Sometimes I think we’re go- 



ing at this wrong. Sure, Chuck’s 
got the long-range view and I 
suppose it’s best. But maybe 
what we ought to do is grab a 
good, fast profit and get out of 
here. We could take in himting 
parties at ten thousand a head or 
maybe we could lease it to a 
movie company.” 

“We can do all that and do it 
legally and with full protection,” 
Cooper told him, “if we can get 
ourselves recognized as a sover- 
eign nation. If we negotiate a 
mutual defense pact, no one 
would dare get hostile because 
we could squawk to Uncle Sam.” 
“All you say is true,” Adan» 
agreed, “but there are going to be 
questions. It isn’t just a matter 
of walking into Washington and 
getting recognition. They’ll want 
to know about us, such as our 
population. What if Chuck has to 
tell them it’s a total of three per- 
sons?” 

C OOPER shook his head. “He 
wouldn’t answer that way, 
Wes. He’d duck the question or 
give them some diplomatic dou- 
ble-talk. After all, how can we 
be sure there are only three of 
us? We took over the whole con- 
tinent, remember.” 

“You know well enough, John- 
ny, there are no other humans 
back here in North America. The 
farthest back any scientist will 
place the migrations from Asia is 



PROJECT MASTODON 



11 



30,000 years. They haven’t got 
here yet.” 

“Maybe we should have done 
it differently,” mused Cooper. 
“Maybe we should have included 
the whole world in our proclama- 
tion, not just the continent. That 
way, we could claim quite a pop- 
ulation.” 

“It wouldn’t have held water. 
Even as it is, we went a little 
further than precedent allows. 
The old explorers usually laid 
claim to certain watersheds. 
They’d find a river and lay claim 
to all the territory drained by the 
river. They didn’t go grabbing off 
whole continents.” 

“That’s because they were nev- 
er sure of exactly what they had,” 
said Cooper. “We are. We have 
what you might call the advan- 
tage of hindsight.” 

He leaned back against the 
tree and stared across the land. It 
was a pretty place, he thought — 
the rolling ridges covered by vast 
grazing areas and small groves, 
the forest-covered, ten-mile river 
valley. And everywhere one 
looked, the grazing herds of mas- 
todon, giant bison and wild 
horses, with the less gregarious 
fauna scattered hit and miss. 

Old Buster, the troublesome 
mastodon, a lone bull which had 
been probably run out of a herd 
by a younger rival, stood at the 
edge of a grove a quarter-mile 
away. He had his head down and 



was curling and uncurling his 
trunk in an aimless sort of way 
while he teetered slowly in a 
lazy-crazy fashion by lifting first 
one foot and then another. 

The old cuss was lonely. Coop- 
er told himself. That was why he 
hung around like a homeless dog 
— except that he was too big and 
awkward to have much pet-ap- 
peal and, more than likely, his 
temper was unstable. 

The afternoon sun was pleas- 
antly warm and the air, it seemed 
to Cooper, was the freshest he 
had ever smelled. It was, alto- 
gether, a very pleasant place, an 
Indian-summer sort of land, ideal 
for a Sunday picnic or a camping 
trip. 

T he breeze was just enough to 
float out from its flagstaff be- 
fore the tent the national banner 
of Mastodonia — a red rampant 
mastodon upon a field of green 
ferns. 

“You know, Johnny,” said Ad- 
ams, “there’s one thing that wor- 
ries me a lot. If we’re going to 
base our claim on precedent, we 
may be way off base. The old ex- 
plorers always claimed their dis- 
coveries for their nations or their 
king, never for themselves.” 

“The principle was entirely 
different,” Cooper told him. “No- 
body ever did anything for him- 
self in those days. Everyone was 
always under someone else’s pro-

tection. The explorers either were 
financed by their governments or 
were sponsored by them or oper- 
ated under a royal charter or a 
patent. With us, it’s different. 
Ours is a private enterprise. You 
dreamed up the time unit and 
built it. The three of us chipped 
in to buy the helicopter. We’ve 
paid all of our expenses out of 
our own pockets. We never got a 
dime from anyone. We never rep- 
resented anyone. What we found 
is ours.” 

“I hope you’re right,” said Ad- 
ams uneasily. 

Old Buster had moved out 
from the grove and was shuffling 
warily toward the camp. Adams 
picked up the rifle that lay across 
his knees. 

“Wait,” said Cooper sharply. 
“Maybe he’s just bluffing. It 
would be a shame to plaster him; 
he’s such a nice old guy.” 

Adams half raised the rifle. 

“I’ll give him three steps 
more,” he announced. “I’ve had 
enough of him.” 

Suddenly a roar burst out of 
the air just above their heads. 
The two leaped to their feet. 

“It’s Chuck!” Cooper yelled. 
“He’s back!” 

The helicopter made a half- 
turn of the camp and came rap- 
idly to Earth. 

Trumpeting with terror. Old 
Buster was a dwindling dot far 
down the grassy ridge. 



T hey built the nightly fires 
circling the camp to keep out 
the animals. 

“It’ll be the death of me yet,” 
said Adams wearily, “cutting all 
this wood.” 

“We have to get to work on 
that stockade,” Cooper said. 
“We’ve fooled around too long. 
Some night, fire or no fire, a herd 
of mastodon will come busting in 
here and if they ever hit the heli- 
copter, we’ll be dead ducks. It 
wouldn’t take more than just five 
seconds to turn us into Robinson 
Crusoes of the Pleistocene.” 
“Well, now that this recogni- 
tion thing has petered out on us,” 
said Adams, “maybe we can get 
down to business.” 

“Trouble is,” Cooper answered, 
“we spent about the last of our 
money on the chain saw to cut 
this wood and on Chuck’s trip to 
Washington. To build a stockade, 
we need a tractor. We’d kill our- 
selves if we tried to rassle that 
many logs bare-handed.” 

“Maybe we could catch some 
of those horses running around 
out there.” 

“Have you ever broken a 
horse?” 

“No, that’s one thing I never 
tried.” 

“Me, either. How about you. 
Chuck?” 

“Not me,” said the ex-ambas-

sador extraordinary bluntly. 

Cooper squatted down beside 
the coals of the cooking fire and 
twirled the spit. Upon the spit 
were three grouse and half a 
dozen quail. The huge coffee pot 
was sending out a nose-tingling 
aroma. Biscuits were baking in 
the reflector. 

“We’ve been here six weeks,” 
he said, “and we’re still living in 
a tent and cooking on an open 
fire. We better get busy and get 
something done.” 

“The stockade first,” said Ad- 
ams, “and that means a tractor.” 
“We could use the helicopter.” 
“Do you want to take the 
chance? That’s our getaway. 
Once something happens to 
it ...” 

“I guess not,” Cooper admitted, 
gulping. 

“We could use some of that 
Point Four aid right now,” com- 
mented Adams. 

“They threw me out,” said 
Hudson. “Everywhere I went, 
sooner or later they got around 
to throwing me out. They were 
real organized about it.” 

‘Well, we tried,” Adams said. 
“And to top it off,” added Hud- 
son, “I had to go and lose all that 
film and now we’ll have to waste 
our time taking more of it. Per- 
sonally, I don’t ever want to let 
another saber-tooth get that close 
to me while I hold the camera.” 
“You didn’t have a thing to 



worry about,” Adams objected. 
“Johnny was right there behind 
you with the gun.” 

“Yeah, with the muzzle about 
a foot from my head when he let 

go” 

“I stopped him, didn’t I?” de- 
manded Cooper. 

“With his head right in my 
lap.” 

“Maybe we won’t have to take 
any more pictures,” Adams sug- 
gested. 

“We’ll have to,” Cooper said. 
“There are sportsmen up ahead 
who’d fork over ten thousand 
bucks easy for two weeks of 
hunting here. But before we could 
sell them on it, we’d have to show 
them movies. That scene with 
the saber-tooth would cinch it.” 

“If it didn’t scare them off,” 
Hudson pointed out “The last 
few feet showed nothing but the 
inside of his throat.” 

E X- AMBASSADOR Hudson 
looked unhappy. “I don’t like 
the whole setup. As soon as we 
bring someone in, the news is sure 
to leak. And once the word gets 
out, there’ll be guys lying in am- 
bush for us — maybe even nations 
— scheming to steal the know- 
how, legally or violently. That’s 
what scares me the most about 
those films I lost. Someone will 
find them and they may guess 
what it’s all about, but I’m hop- 
ing they either won’t believe it or 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



can’t manage to trace us.” 

“We could swear the hunting 
parties to secrecy,” said Cooper. 

“How could a sportsman keep 
still about the mounted head of 
a saber-tooth or a record piece of 
ivory? And the same thing would 
apply to anyone we approached. 
Some university could raise 
dough to send a team of scientists 
back here and a movie company 
would cough up plenty to use 
this place as a location for a 
caveman epic. But it wouldn’t be 
worth a thing to either of them if 
they couldn’t tell about it. 

“Now if we could have gotten 
recognition as a nation, we’d have 
been all set. We could make our 
own laws and regulations and be 
able to enforce them. We could 
bring in settlers and establish 
trade. We could exploit our nat- 
ural resources. It would all be 
legal and aboveboard. We could 
tell who we were and where we 
were and what we had to offer.” 
“We aren’t licked yet,” said 
Adams. “There’s a lot that we 
can do. Those river hills are cov- 
ered with ginseng. We can each 
dig a dozen pounds a day. 
There’s good money in the root.” 
“Ginseng root,” Cooper said, 
“is peanuts. We need bi^ money.” 
“Or we could trap,” offered 
Adams. “The place is alive with 
beaver.” 

“Have you taken a good look 
at those beaver? They’re about 



the size of a St. Bernard.” 

“All the better. Think how 
much just one pelt, would bring.” 
“No dealer would believe that 
it was beaver. He’d think you 
were tr3dng to pull a fast one on 
him. And there are only a few 
states that allow beaver to be 
trapped. To sell the pelts — even 
if you could — you’d have to take 
out licenses in each of those 
states.” 

“Those mastodon carry a lot 
of ivory,” said Cooper. “And if 
we wanted to go north, we’d find 
mammoths that would carry 
even more . .” 

“And get socked into the jug 
for ivory smuggling?” 

They sat, all three of them, 
staring at the fire, not finding 
anything to say. 

The moaning complaint of a 
giant hunting cat came from 
somewhere up the river. 

IV 

TTUDSON lay in his sleeping 
-l-l- bag, staring at the sky. It 
bothered him a lot. There was 
not one familiar constellation, 
not one star that he could name 
with any certainty. This jugg lin g 
of the stars, he thought, empha- 
sized more than anything else in 
this ancient land the vast gulf of 
years which lay between him and 
the Earth where he had been — or 
would be — born. 



PROJECT MASTODON 



IS 



A hundred and fifty thousand 
years, Adams had said, give or 
take ten thousand. There just 
was no way to know. Later on, 
there might be. A measurement 
of the stars and a comparison 
with their positions in the twen- 
tieth centvuy might be one way 
of doing it. But at the moment, 
any figure could be no more than 
a guess. 

The time machine was not 
something that could be tested 
for calibration or performance. 
As a matter of fact, there was no 
way to test it. They had not been 
certain, he remembered, the first 
time they had used it, that it 
would really work. There had 
been no way to find out. When 
it worked, you knew it worked. 
And if it hadn’t worked, there 
would have been no way of 
knowing beforehand that it 
wouldn’t. 

Adams had been sure, of course, 
but that had been because he had 
absolute reliance in the half- 
mathematical, half - philosophic 
concepts he had worked out — 
concepts that neither Hudson nor 
Cooper could come close to un- 
derstanding. 

That had always been the way 
it had been, even when they were 
kids, with Wes dreaming up the 
deals that he and Johnny carried 
out. Back in those days, too, they 
had used time travel in their play. 
Out in Johnny’s back yard, they 



had rigged up a time machine out 
of a wonderful collection of sal- 
vaged junk — a wooden crate, an 
empty five-gallon paint pail, a 
battered coffee maker, a bunch of 
discarded copper tubing, a busted 
steering wheel and other odds 
and ends. In it, they had “trav- 
eled” back to Indian-before-the- 
white-man land and mammoth- 
land and dinosaur-land and the 
slaughter, he remembered, had 
been wonderfully appalling. 

But, in reality, it had been 
much different. There was much 
more to it than gunning down the 
weird fauna that one foimd. 

And they should have known 
there would be, for they had talk- 
ed about it often. 

He thought of the bull session 
back in university and the little, 
usually silent kid who sat quietly 
in the comer, a law-school stud- 
ent whose last name had been 
Pritchard. 

And after sitting silently for 
some time, this Pritchard kid had 
spoken up: “If you guys ever do 
travel in time, you’ll run up 
against more than you bargain 
for. I don’t mean the climate or 
the terrain or the fauna, but the 
economics and the politics.” 

t^HEY all peered at him, Hud- 
son remembered, and then 
gone on with their talk. And after 
a short while, the talk had turned 
to women, as it always did. 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He wondered where that quiet 
man might be. Some day, Hud- 
son told himself, I’ll have to look 
him up and tell him he was right. 

We did it wrong, he thought. 
There were so many other ways 
we might have done it, but we’d 
been so sure and greedy — greedy 
for the triumph and the glory — 
and now there was no easy way 
to collect. 

On the verge of success, they 
could have sought out help, gone 
to some large industrial concern 
or an educational foundation or 
even to the government. Like his- 
toric explorers, they could have 
obtained subsidization and spon- 
sorship. Then they would have 
had protection, funds to do a 
proper job and they need not 
have operated on their present 
shoestring — one beaten-up heli- 
copter and one time unit. They 
could have had several and at 
least one standing by in the twen- 
tieth century as a rescue unit, 
should that be necessary. 

But that would have meant a 
bargain, perhaps a very hard one, 
and sharing with someone who 
had contributed nothing but the 
money. And there was more than 
money in a thing like this — ^there 
were twenty years of dreams and 
a great idea and the dedication 
to that great idea — years of work 
and years of disappointment and 
an almost fanatical refusal to give 
up. 



Even so, thought Hudson, they 
had figured well enough. There 
had been many chances to make 
blunders and they’d made rela- 
tively few. All they lacked, in the 
last analysis, was backing. 

Take the helicopter, for ex- 
ample. It was the one satisfactory 
vehicle for time traveling. You 
had to get up in the air to clear 
whatever upheavals and subsi- 
dences there had been through 
geologic ages. The helicopter took 
you up and kept you clear and 
gave you a chance to pick a prop- 
er landing place. Travel without 
it and, granting you were lucky 
with land surfaces, you still might 
materialize in the heart of some 
great tree or end up in a swamp 
or the middle of a herd of star- 
tled, savage beasts. A plane would 
have done as well, but back in this 
world, you couldn’t land a plane 
— or you couldn’t be certain that 
you could. A helicopter, though, 
could land almost anywhere. 

In the time-distance they had 
traveled, they almost certainly 
had been lucky, although one 
could not be entirely sure just 
how great a part of it was luck. 
Wes had felt that he had not been 
working as blindly as it some- 
times might appear. He had cali- 
brated the unit for jumps of 50,- 
000 years. Finer calibration, he 
had said realistically, would have 
to wait for more developmental 
work. 



PROJECT MASTODON 



17 



U SING the 50,000-year calibra- 
tions, they had figured it out. 
One jump (conceding that the 
calibration was correct) would 
have landed them at the end of 
the Wisconsin glacial period; two 
jumps, at its beginning. The third 
would set them down toward the 
end of the Sangamon Interglacial 
and apparently it had — give or 
take ten thousand years or so. 

They had arrived at a time 
when the climate did not seem 
to vary greatly, either hot or cold. 
The flora was modern enough 
to give them a homelike feeling. 
The fauna, modem and Pleisto- 
cenic, overlapped. And the surface 
features were little altered from 
the twentieth century. The rivers 
ran along familiar paths, the hills 
and bluffs looked much the same. 
In this comer of the Earth, at 
least, 150,000 years had not 
changed things greatly. 

Boyhood dreams, Hudson 
thought, were wondrous. It was 
not often that three men who had 
daydreamed in their youth could 
follow it out to its end. But they 
had and here they were. 

Johnny was on watch, and it 
was Hudson’s turn next, and he’d 
better get to sleep. He closed his 
eyes, then opened them again for 
another look at the unfamiliar 
stars. The east, he saw, was flush- 
ed with silver light. Soon the 
Moon would rise, which was good. 
A man could keep a better watch 



when the Moon was up. 

He woke suddenly, snatched 
upright and into full awareness 
by the marrow-chilling clamor 
that slashed across the night. The 
very air seemed curdled by the 
savage racket and, for a moment, 
he sat numbed by it. Then, slow- 
ly, it seemed — his brain took the 
noise and separated it into two 
distinct but intermingled cate- 
gories, the deadly screaming of 
a cat and the maddened trump- 
eting of a mastodon. 

The Moon was up and the 
countryside was flooded by its 
light. Cooper, he saw, was out be- 
yond the watchfires, standing 
there and watching, with his rifle 
ready. Adams was scrambling 
out of his sleeping bag, swearing 
softly to himself. The cooking 
fire had burned down to a bed 
of mottled coals, but the watch- 
fires still were burning and the 
helicopter, parked within their 
circle, picked up the glint of 
flames. 

“It’s Buster,” Adams told him 
angrily. “I’d know that bellowing 
of his anywhere. He’s done noth- 
ing but parade up and down and 
bellow ever since we got here. 
And now he seems to gone out 
and found himself a saber-tooth.” 

Hudson zipped down his sleep- 
ing bag, grabbed up his rifle and 
jumped to his feet, following 
Adams in a silent rush to where 
Cooper stood. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Cooper motioned at them. 
“Don’t break it up. You’ll never 
see the like of it again.” 

Adams brought his rifle up. 

Cooper knocked the barrel 
down. 

“You fool!” he shouted. “You 
want them turning on us?” 

npWO hundred yards away 
stood the mastodon and, on 
his back, the screeching saber- 
tooth. The great beast reared into 
the air and came down with a jolt, 
bucking to unseat the cat, flailing 
the air with his massive trunk. 
And as he bucked, the cat struck 
and struck again with his gleam- 
ing teeth, aiming for the spine. 

Then the mastodon crashed 
head downward, as if to turn a 
somersault, rolled and was on his 
feet again, closer to them now 
than he had been before. The 
huge cat had sprung off. 

For a moment, the two stood 
facing one another. Then the 
tiger charged, a flowing streak 
of motion in the moonlight. Bus- 
ter wheeled away and the cat, 
leaping, hit his shoulder, clawed 
wildly and slid off. The mastodon 
whipped to the attack, tusks 
slashing, huge feet stamping. The 
cat, caught a glancing blow by 
one of the tusks, screamed and 
leaped up, to land in spread- 
eagle fashion upon Buster’s head. 

Maddened with pain and 
fright, blinded by the tiger’s 

PROJECT MASTODON 



raking claws, the old mastodon 
ran — straight toward the camp. 
And as he ran, he grasped the cat 
in his trunk and tore him from 
his hold, lifted him high and 
threw him. 

“Look out!” yelled Cooper and 
brought his rifle up and fired. 

For an instant, Hudson saw it 
all as if it were a single scene, 
motionless, one frame snatched 
from a fantastic movie epic — ^the 
charging mastodon, with the tiger 
lifted and the sound track one 
great blast of bloodthirsty bed- 
lam. 

Then the scene dissolved in 
a blur of motion. He felt his rifle 
thud against his shoulder, know- 
ing he had fired, but not hearing 
the explosion. And the mastodon 
was almost on top of him, bear- 
ing down like some mighty and 
remorseless engine of blind de- 
struction. 

He flung himself, to one side and 
the giant brushed past him. Out 
of the tail of his eye, he saw the 
thrown saber-tooth crash to Earth 
within the circle of the watch- 
fires. 

He brought his rifle up again 
and caught the area behind Bus- 
ter’s ear within his sights. He 
pressed the trigger. The masto- 
don staggered, then regained his 
stride and went rushing on. He 
hit one of the watchfires dead 
center and went through it, scat- 
tering coals and burning brands. 

19 



Then there was a thud and the 
screeching clang of metal. 

“Oh, no!” shouted Hudson. 

Rushing forward, they stopped 
inside the circle of the fires. 

The helicopter lay tilted at a 
crazy angle. One of its rotor 
blades was crumpled. Half across 
it, as if he might have fallen as 
he tried to bull his mad way 
over it, lay the mastodon. 

Something crawled across the 
ground toward them, its spitting, 
snarling head gaping in the fire- 
light, its back broken, hind legs 
trailing. 

Calmly, without a word, Adams 
put a bullet into the head of the 
saber-tooth. 

V 

G eneral Leslie Bowers rose 
from his chair and paced up 
and down the room. He stopped 
to bang the conference table with 
a knotted fist. 

“You can’t do it,” he bawled 
at them. “You can’t kill the proj- 
ect. I know there’s something to 
it. We can’t give it up!” 

“But it’s been ten years. Gen- 
eral,” said the secretary of the 
army. “If they were coming back, 
they’d be here by now.” 

The general stopped his pacing, 
stiffened. Who did that little 
civilian squirt think he was, talk- 
ing to the military in that tone 
of voice! 



“We know how you feel about 
it. General,” said the chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff. “I 
think we all recognize how deeply 
you’re involved. You’ve blamed 
yourself all these years and there 
is no need of it. After all, there 
may be nothing to it.” 

“Sir,” said the general, “I know 
there’s something to it. I thought 
so at the time, even when no one 
else did. And what we’ve turned 
up since serves to bear me out. 
Let’s take a look at these three 
men of ours. We knew almost 
nothing of them at the time, but 
we know them now. I’ve traced 
out their lives from the time that 
they were born until they disap- 
peared — and I might add that, 
on the chance it might be all a 
hoax, we’ve searched for them for 
years and we’ve found no trace 
at all. 

“I’ve talked with those who 
knew them and I’ve studied their 
scholastic and military records. 
I’ve arrived at the conclusion that 
if any three men could do it, they 
were the ones who could. Adams 
was the brains and the other two 
were the ones who carried out 
the things that he dreamed up. 
Cooper was a bulldog sort of 
man who could keep them going 
and it would be Hudson who 
would figure out the angles. 

“And they knew the angles, 
gentlemen. They had it all doped 
out. 



PROJECT MASTODON 



21 



“What Hudson tried here in 
Washington is substantial proof 
of that. But even back in school, 
they were thinking of those 
angles. I talked some years ago 
to a lawyer in New York, name 
of Pritchard. He told me that 
even back in university, they talk- 
ed of the economic and political 
problems that they might face 
if they ever cracked what they 
were working at. 

“Wesley Adams was one of 
our brightest young scientific 
men. His record at the university 
and his war work bears that out. 
After the war, there were at least 
a dozen jobs he could have had. 
But he wasn’t interested. And 
I’ll tell you why he wasn’t. He 
had something bigger — something 
he wanted to work on. So he and 
these two others went off by 
themselves — ’’ 

“You think he was working on 
a temporal — ’’ the army secre- 
tary cut in. 

“He was working on a time 
machine,” roared the general. “I 
don’t know about this ‘temporal’ 
business. Just plain ‘time ma- 
chine’ is good enough for me.” 

“Let’s calm down. General,” 
said the JCS chairman. “After 
all, there’s no need to shout.” 

rrHE general nodded. “I’m sor- 
ry, sir. I get all worked up 
about this. I’ve spent the last ten 
years with it. As you say. I’m 



trying to make up for what I 
failed to do ten years ago. I 
should have talked to Hudson. 
I was busy, sure, but not that 
busy. It’s an official state of mind 
that we’re too busy to see anyone 
and I plead guilty on that score. 
And now that you’re talking 
about closing the project — ” 

“It’s costing us money,” said 
the army secretary. 

“And we have no direct evi- 
dence,” pointed out the JCS 
chairman. 

“I don’t know what you want,” 
snapped the general. “If there 
was any man alive who could 
crack time, that man was Wesley 
Adams. We found where he work- 
ed. We found the workshop and 
we talked to neighbors who said 
there was something funny going 
on and — ” 

“But then years. General!” the 
army secretary protested. 

“Hudson came here, bringing 
us the greatest discovery in all 
history, and we kicked him out. 
After that, do you expect them 
to come crawling back to us?” 

“You think they went to some- 
one else?” 

“They wouldn’t do that. They 
know what the thing they have 
found would mean. They would- 
n’t sell us out.” 

“Hudson came with a prepos- 
terous proposition,” said the man 
from the state department. 

“They had to protect them- 



22

selves!” yelled the general. “If 
you had discovered a virgin plan- 
et with its natural resources in- 
tact, what would you do about it? 
Come trotting down here and 
hand it over to a government 
that’s too ‘busy’ to recognize — ” 

“Generali” 

“Yes, sir,” apologized the gen- 
eral tiredly. “I wish you gentle- 
men could see my view of it, how 
it all fits together. First there 
were the films and we have the 
word of a dozen competent pal- 
eontologists that it’s impossible 
to fake anything as perfect as 
those films. But even granting 
that they could be, there are cer- 
tain differences that no one would 
ever think of faking, because no 
one ever knew. Who, as an exam- 
ple, would put lynx tassels on 
the ears of a saber-tooth? Who 
would know that young masto- 
don were black? 

“And the location. I wonder if 
you’ve forgotten that we tracked 
down the location of Adams’ 
workshop from those films alone. 
They gave us clues so positive 
that we didn’t even hesitate — ^we 
drove straight to the old deserted 
farm where Adams and his 
friends had worked. Don’t you 
see how it all fits together?” 

“I presume,” the man from 
the state department said nas- 
tily, “that you even have an ex- 
planation as to why they chose 
that particular location.” 

PROJECT MASTODON 



“Y’OU thought you had me 

^ there,” said the general, “but 
I have an answer. A good one. 
The southwestern comer of Wis- 
consin is a geologic curiosity. It 
was missed by all the glaciations. 
Why, we do not know. Whatever 
the reason, the glaciers came 
down on both sides of it and far 
to the south of it and left it stand- 
ing there, a little island in a sea 
of ice. 

“And another thing: Except 
for a time in the Triassic, that 
same area of Wisconsin has al- 
ways been dry land. That and a 
few other spots are the only areas 
in North America which have 
not, time and time again, been 
covered by water. I don’t think 
it necessary to point out the com- 
fort it would be to an experi- 
mental traveler in time to be 
certain that, in almost any era he 
might hit, he’d have dry land 
beneath him.” 

The economics expert spoke up: 
“We’ve given this matter a lot 
of study and, while we do not feel 
ourselves competent to rule upon 
the possibility or impossibility of 
time travel, there are some obser- 
vations I should like, at some 
time, to make.” 

“Go ahead right now,” said 
the JCS chairman. 

“We see one objection to the 
entire matter. One of the reasons, 
naturally, that we had some in- 
terest in it is that, if true, it would 

23 



give us an entire new planet to 
exploit, perhaps more wisely than 
we’ve done in the past. But the 
thought occurs that any planet 
has only a certain grand total of 
natural resources. If we go into 
the past and exploit them, what 
effect will that have upon what is 
left of those resources for use in 
the present? Wouldn’t we, in do- 
ing this, be robbing ourselves of 
our own heritage?” 

“That contention,” said the 
AEC chairman, “wouldn’t hold 
true in every case. Quite the re- 
verse, in fact. We know that there 
was, in some geologic ages in the 
past, a great deal more uranium 
than we have today. Go back far 
enough and you’d catch that 
uranium before it turned into 
lead. In southwestern Wisconsin, 
there is a lot of lead. Hudson told 
us he knew the location of vast 
uranium deposits and we thought 
he was a crackpot talking through 
his hat. If we’d known — let’s be 
fair about this — if we had known 
and believed him about going 
back in time, we’d have snapped 
him up at once and all this would 
not have happened.” 

“It wouldn’t hold true with 
forests, either,” said the chair- 
man of the JCS. “Or with pas- 
tures or with crops.” 

npHE economics expert was 
slightly flushed. “There is an- 
other thing,” he said. “If we go 



back in time and colonize the 
land we find there, what would 
happen when that — well, let’s call 
it retroactive — ^when that retro- 
active civilization reaches the be- 
ginning of our historic period? 
What will result from that cul- 
tural collision? Will our history 
change? Is what has happened 
false? Is all—” 

“That’s all poppycock!” the 
general shouted. “That and this 
other talk about using up resour- 
ces. Whatever we did in the past 
— or are about to do — has been 
done already. I’ve lain awake 
nights, mister, thinking about all 
these things and there is no an- 
swer, believe me, except the one 
I give you. The question which 
faces us here is an immediate one. 
Do we give all this up or do we 
keep on watching that Wisconsin 
farm, waiting for them to come 
back? Do we keep on trying to 
find, independently, the process 
or formula or method that Adams 
found for traveling in tiihe?” 
“We’ve had no luck in our re- 
search so far. General,” said the 
quiet physicist who sat at the 
table’s end. “If you were not so 
sure and if the evidence were not 
so convincing that it had been 
done by Adams, I’d say flatly 
that it is impossible. We have no 
approach which holds any hope 
at all. What we’ve done so far, 
you might best describe as floun- 
der. But if Adams turned the 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



trick, it must be possible. There 
may be, as a matter of fact, more 
ways than one. We’d like to keep 
on trying.” 

“Not one word of blame has 
been put on you for your fail- 
ure,” the chairman told the phy- 
sicist. “That you could do it 
seems to be more than can be 
humanly expected. If Adams did 
it — ii he did, I say — it must have 
been simply that he blundered on 
an avenue of research no other 
man has thought of.” 

“You will recall,” said the gen- 
eral, “that the research program, 
even from the first, was thought 
of strictly as a gamble. Our one 
hope was, and must remain, that 
they will return.” 

“It would have been so much 
simpler all around,” the state 
department man said, “if Adams 
had patented his method.” 

The general raged at him. “And 
had it published, all neat and 
orderly, in the patent office rec- 
ords so that anyone who wanted 
it could look it up and have it?” 
“We can be most sincerely 
thankful,” said the chairman, 
“that he did not patent it.”

T he helicopter would never fly 
again, but the time unit was 
intact. 

Which didn’t mean that it 
would work. 

PROJECT MASTODON 



They held a powwow at their 
camp site. It had been, they de- 
cided, simpler to move the camp 
than to remove the body of Old 
Buster. So they had shifted at 
dawn, leaving the old mastodon 
still sprawled across the helicop- 
ter. 

In a day or two, they knew, 
the great bones would be cleanly 
picked by the carrion birds, the 
lesser cats, the wolves and foxes 
and the little skulkers. 

Getting the time unit out of 
the helicopter had been quite a 
chore, but they finally had man- 
aged and now Adams sat with it 
cradled in his lap. 

“The worst of it,” he told them, 
“is that I can’t test it. There’s 
no way to. You turn it on and it 
works or it doesn’t work. You 
can’t know till you try.” 

“That’s something we can’t 
help,” Cooper replied. “The prob- 
lem, seems to me, is how we’re 
going to use it without the whirly- 
bird.” 

“We have to figure out some 
way to get up in the air,” said 
Adams. “We don’t want to take 
the chance of going up into the 
twentieth century and arriving 
there about six feet underground.” 

“Common sense says that we 
should be higher here than up 
ahead,” Hudson pointed out. 
“These hills have stood here since 
Jurassic times. They probably 
were a good deal higher then and 

25 



have weathered down. That 
weathering still should be going 
on. So we should be higher here 
than in the twentieth century — 
not much, perhaps, but higher.” 

“Did anyone ever notice what 
the altimeter read?” asked Coop- 
er. 

“I don’t believe I did,” Adams 
admitted. 

“It wouldn’t tell you, anyhow,” 
Hudson declared. “It would just 
give our height then and now — 
and we were moving, remember 
— and what about air pockets and 
relative atmosphere density and 
all the rest?” 

C OOPER looked as discour- 
aged as Hudson felt. 

“How does this sound?” asked 
Adams. “We’ll build a platform 
twelve feet high. That certainly 
should be enough to clear us and 
yet small enough to stay within 
the range of the unit’s force- 
field.” 

“And what if we’re two feet 
higher here?” Hudson pointed 
out. 

“A fall of fourteen feet would- 
n’t kill a man unless he’s plain 
unlucky.” 

“It might break some bones.” 
“So it might break some bones. 
You want to stay here or take a 
chance on a broken leg?” 

“All right, if you put it that 
way. A platform, you say. A 
platform out of what?” 



“Timber. There’s lot of it. We 
just go out and cut some logs.” 
“A twelve-foot log is heavy. 
And how are we going to get that 
big a log uphill?” 

“We drag it.” 

“We try to, you mean.” 
“Maybe we could fix up a 
cart,” said Adams, after think- 
ing a moment. 

“Out of what?” Cooper asked. 
“Rollers, maybe. We could cut 
some and roll the logs up here.” 
“That would work on level 
ground,” Hudson said. “It would- 
n’t work to roll a log uphill. It 
would get away from us. Some- 
one might get killed.” 

“The logs would have to be 
longer than twelve feet, anyhow,” 
Cooper put in. “You’d have to 
set them in a hole and that takes 
away some footage.” 

“Why not the tripod princi- 
ple?” Hudson offered. “Fasten 
three logs at the top and raise 
them.” 

“That’s a gin-pole, a primi- 
tive derrick. It’d still have to be 
longer than twelve feet. Fifteen, 
sixteen, maybe. And how are we 
going to hoist three sixteen-foot 
logs? We’d need a block and 
tackle.” 

“There’s another thing,” said 
Cooper. “Part of those logs might 
just be beyond the effective range 
of the force-field. Part of them 
would have to — have to, mind 
you — move in time and part 



26 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



couldn’t. That would set up a 
stress ...” 

“Another thing about it,” add- 
ed Hudson, “is that we’d travel 
with the logs. I don’t want to 
Cbme out in another time with a 
bunch of logs flying all around 
me. 

“Cheer up,” Adams told them. 
“Maybe the unit won’t work, 
anyhow.” 

VII 

T he general sat alone in his 
office and held his head be- 
tween his hands. The fools, he 
thought, the goddam knuckle- 
headed fools! Why couldn’t they 
see it as clearly as he did? 

For fifteen years now, as head 
of Project Mastodon, he had 
lived with it night and day and 
he could see all the possibilities 
as clearly as if they had been 
actual fact. Not military possi- 
bilities alone, although as a mili- 
tary man, he naturally would 
think of those first. 

The hidden bases, for example, 
located within the very strong- 
holds of potential enemies — with- 
in, yet centuries removed in time. 
Many centuries removed and 
only seconds distant. 

He could see it all: The mate- 
rialization of the fleets; the swift, 
devastating blow, then the in- 
stantaneous retreat into the fast- 
nesses of the past. Terrific 

PROJECT MASTODON 



destruction, but not a ship lost 
nor a man. 

Except that if you had the 
bases, you need never strike the 
blow. If you had the bases and 
let the enemy know you had 
them, there would never be the 
provocation. 

And on the home front, you’d 
have air-raid shelters that would 
be effective. You’d evacuate your 
population not in space, but time. 
You’d haye the sure and absolute 
defense against any kind of 
bombing — fission, fusion, bacte- 
riological or whatever else the 
labs had in stock. 

And if the worst should come 
— which it never would with a 
setup like that — you’d have a 
place to which the entire nation 
could retreat, leaving to the en- 
emy the empty, blasted cities and 
the lethally dusted countryside. 

Sanctuary — ^that had been what 
Hudson had offered the then-sec- 
retary of state fifteen years ago 
— and the idiot had frozen up 
with the insult of it and had 
Hudson thrown out. 

And if war did not come, think 
of the living space and the vast 
new opportimities — not the least 
of which would be the opportu- 
nity to achieve peaceful living in 
a virgin world, where the old 
hatreds would slough off and new 
concepts have a chance to grow. 

He wondered where they were, 
those three who had gone back 

27 



into time. Dead, perhaps. Run 
down by a mastodon. Or stalked 
by tigers. Or maybe done in by 
warlike tribesmen. No, he kept 
forgetting there weren’t any in 
that era. Or trapped in time, un- 
able to get back, condemned to 
exile in an alien time. Or maybe, 
he thought, just plain disgusted. 
And he couldn’t blame them if 
they were. 

Or maybe — let’s be fantastic 
about this — sneaking in colonists 
from some place other than the 
watched Wisconsin farm, build- 
ing up in actuality the nation 
they had claimed to be. 

They had to get back to the 
present soon or Project Masto- 
don would be killed entirely. Al- 
ready the research program had 
been halted and if something 
didn’t happen quickly, the watch 



that was kept on the Wisconsin 
farm would be called off. 

“And if they do that,” said the 
general, “I know just what I’ll 
do.” 

He got up and strode around 
the room. 

“By God,” he said, “I’ll show 
’em!” 

VIII 

I T had taken ten full days of 
back-breaking work to build 
the pyramid. They’d hauled the 
^ocks from the creek bed half a 
mile away and had piled them. 



stone by rolling stone, to the 
height of a full twelve feet. It 
took a lot of rocks and a lot of 
patience, for as the pyramid went 
up, the base naturally kept broad- 
ening out. 

But now all was finally ready. 

Hudson sat before the burned- 
out campfire and held his blis- 
tered hands before him. 

It should work, he thought, 
better than the logs — and less 
dangerous. 

Grab a handful of sand. Some 
trickled back between your fin- 
gers, but most stayed in your 
grasp. That was the principle of 
the pyramid of stones. When — 
and if — ^the time machine should 
work, most of the rocks would go 
along. 

Those that didn’t go would 
simply trickle out and do no 
harm. There’d be no stress or 
strain to upset the working of the 
force-field. 

And if the time unit didn’t 
work? 

Or if it did? 

This was the end of the dream, 
thought Hudson, no matter how 
you looked at it. 

For even if they did get back 
to the twentieth century, there 
would be no money and with the 
film lost and no other taken to 
replace it, they’d have no proof 
they had traveled back beyond 
the dawn of history — back al- 
most to the dawn of Man. 




PROJECT MASTODON

Although how far you traveled 
would have no significance. An 
hour or a million years would be 
all the same; if you could span 
the hour, you could span the mil- 
lion years. And if you could go 
back the million years, it was 
within your power to go back to 
the first tick of eternity, the first 
stir of time across the face of 
emptiness and nothingness — back 
to that initial instant when noth- 
ing as yet had happened or been 
planned or thought, when all the 
vastness of the Universe was a 
new slate waiting the first chalk 
stroke of destiny. 

Another helicopter would cost 
thirty thousand dollars — and they 
didn’t even have the money to 
buy the tractor that they needed 
to build the stockade. 

There was no way to borrow. 
You couldn’t walk into a bank 
and say you wanted thirty thou- 
sand to take a trip back to the 
Old Stone Age. 

You still could go to some in- 
dustry or some university or the 
government and if you could per- 
suade them you had something 
on the ball — ^why, then, they 
might put up the cash after cut- 
ting themselves in on just about 
all of the profits. And, naturally, 
they’d run the show because it 
was their money and all you had 
done was the sweating and the 
bleeding. 

“There’s one thing that still 



bothers me,” said Cooper, break- 
ing the silence. “We spent a lot 
of time picking our spot so we’d 
miss the barn and house and all 
the other buildings . .” 

“Don’t tell me the windmill!” 
Hudson cried. 

“No. I’m pretty sure we’re 
clear of that. But the way I fig- 
ure, we’re right astraddle that 
barbed -wire fence at the south 
end of the orchard.” 

“If you want, we could move 
the pyramid over twenty feet or 
so.” 

Cooper groaned. “I’ll take my 
chances with the fence.” Adams 
got to his feet, the time unit 
tucked underneath his arm. 
“Come on, you guys. It’s tim6 to 
go.” 

They climbed the pyramid 
gingerly and stood unsteadily at 
its top. 

Adams shifted the unit around, 
clasped it to his chest. 

“Stand around close,” he said, 
“and bend your knees a little. It 
may be quite a drop.” 

“Go ahead,” said Cooper. 
“Press the button.” 

Adams pressed the button. 

Nothing happened. 

The unit didn’t work.

^¥^HE chief of Central Intelli- 
gence was white-lipped when 
he finished talking.

“You’re sure of your informa- 
tion?” asked the F^esident. 

“Mr. President,” said the CIA 
chief, “I’ve never been more sure 
of anything in my entire life.” 

The President looked at the 
other two who were in the room, 
a question in his eyes. 

The JCS chairman said, “It 
checks, sir, with everything we 
know.” 

“But it’s incredible!” the Presi- 
dent said. 

“They’re afraid,” said the CIA 
chief. “They lie awake nights. 
They’ve become convinced that 
we’re on the verge of traveling in 
time. They’ve tried and failed, 
but they think we’re near success. 
To their way of thinking, they've 
got to hit us now or never, be- 
cause once we actually get time 
travel, they know their number’s 
up.” 

“But we dropped Project Mas- 
todon ehtirely almost three years 
ago. It’s been all of ten years 
since we stopped the research. It 
was twenty-five years ago that 
Hudson — ” 

“That makes no difference, sir. 
They’re convinced we dropped 
the project publicly, but went 
underground with it. That would 
be the kind of strategy they could 
understand.” 

The President picked up a 
pencil and doodled on a pad. 

“Who was that old general,” 
he asked, “the one who raised so 



much fuss when we dropped the 
project? I remember I was in the 
Senate then. He came around to 
see me.” 

“Bowers, sir,” said the JCS 
chairman. 

“That’s right. What became of 
him?” 

“Retired.” 

“Well, I guess it doesn’t make 
any difference now.” He doodled 
some more and finally said, 
“Gentlemen, it looks like this is 
it. How much time did you say 
we had?” 

“Not more than ninety days, 
sir. Maybe as little as thirty.” 

The President looked up at the 
JCS chairman. 

“We’re as ready,” said the 
chairman, “as we will ever be. 
We can handle them — I think. 
There will, of course, be some — ” 

“I know,” said the President. 

“Could we bluff?” asked the 
secretary of state, speaking qui- 
etly. “I know it wouldn’t stick, 
but at least we might buy some 
time.” 

“You mean hint that we have 
time travel?” 

The secretary nodded. 

“It wouldn’t work,” said the 
CIA chief tiredly. “If we really 
had it, there’d be no question 
then. They’d become exceedingly 
well-mannered, even neighborly, 
if they were sure we had i^.” 

“But we haven’t got it,” said 
the President gloomily.

*^HE two hunters trudged 
homeward late in the after- 
noon, with a deer slung from a 
pole they carried on their shoul- 
ders. Their breath hung visibly in 
the air as they walked along, for 
the frost had come and any day 
now, they knew, there would be 
snow. 

“I’m worried about Wes,” said 
Cooper, breathing heavily. “He’s 
taking this too hard. We got to 
keep an eye on him.” 

“Let’s take a rest,” panted 
Hudson. 

They halted and lowered the 
deer to the ground. 

“He blames himself too much,” 
said Cooper. He wiped his sweaty 
forehead. “There isn’t any need 
to. All of us walked into this with 
our eyes wide open.” 

“He’s kidding himself and he 
knows it, but it gives him some- 
thing to go on. As long as he can 
keep busy with all his puttering 
around, he’ll be all right.” 

“He isn’t going to repair the 
time unit. Chuck.” 

“I know he isn’t. And he knows 
it, too. He hasn’t got the tools or 
the materials. Back in the work- 
shop, he might have a chance, 
but here he hasn’t.” 

“It’s rough on him.” 

“It’s rough on all of us.” 

“Yes, but we didn’t get a 
brainstorm that marooned two 



old friends in this tail end of no- 
where. And we can’t make him 
swallow it when we say that it’s 
okay, we don’t mind at all.” 

“That’s a lot to swallow, John- 
ny.” 

“What’s going to happen to us. 
Chuck?” 

“We’ve got ourselves a place to 
live and there’s lots to eat. Save 
our ammo for the big game — a 
lot of eating for each bullet — and 
trap the smaller animals.” 

“I’m wondering what will hap- 
pen when the flour and all the 
other stuff is gone. We don’t have 
too much of it because we al- 
ways figured we could bring in 
more.” 

‘We’ll live on meat,” said 
Hudson. “We got bison by the 
million. The plains Indians lived 
on them alone. And in the spring, 
we’ll find roots and in the sum- 
mer berries. And in the fall, we’ll 
harvest a half-dozen klhds of 
nuts.” 

“Some day our ammo will be 
gone, no matter how careful we 
are with it.” 

“Bows and arrows. Slingshots. 
Spears.” 

“There’s a lot of beasts here I 
wouldn’t want to stand up to 
with nothing but a spear.” 

“We won’t stand up to them. 
We’ll duck when we can and run 
when we can’t duck. Without our 
guns, we’re no lords of creation — 
not in this place. If we’re going 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to live, we’ll have to recognize 
that fact.” 

“And if one of us gets sick or 
breaks a leg or — ” 

“We’ll do the best we can. No- 
body lives forever.” 

B ut they were talking around 
the thing that really bothered 
them, Hudson told himself — each 
of them afraid to speak the 
thought aloud. 

They’d live, all right, so far as 
food, shelter and clothing were 
concerned. And they’d live most 
of the time in plenty, for this was 
a fat and open-handed land and 
a man could make an easy living. 

But the big problem — the one 
they were afraid to talk about — 
was their emptiness of purpose. 
To live, they had to find some 
meaning in a world without so- 
ciety. 

A man cast away on a desert 
isle could always live for hope, 
but here there was no hope. A 
Robinson Crusoe was separated 
from his fellow-humans by, at 
the most, a few thousand miles. 
Here they were separated by a 
hundred and fifty thousand years. 

Wes Adams was the lucky one 
so far. Even playing his thou- 
sand -to-one shot, he still held 
tightly to a purpose, feeble as it 
might be — ^the hope that he could 
repair the time machine. 

We don’t need to watch him 
now, thought Hudson. The time 



we’ll have to watch is when he is 
forced to admit he can’t fix the 
machine. 

And both Hudson and Cooper 
had been kept sane enough, for 
there had been the cabin to be 
built and the winter’s supply of 
wood to cut and the hunting to 
be done. 

But then there would come a 
time when all the chores were 
finished and there was nothing 
left to do. 

“You ready to go?” asked 
Cooper. 

“Sure. All rested now,” said 
Hudson. 

They hoisted the pole to their 
shoulders and started off again. 

Hudson had lain awake nights 
thinking of it and all the thoughts 
had been dead ends. 

One could write a natural his- 
tory of the Pleistocene, complete 
with photographs and sketches, 
and it would be a pointless thing 
to do, because no future scientist 
would ever have a chance to read 
it. 

Or they might labor to build 
a memorial, a vast pyramid, 
perhaps, which would carry a 
message forward across fifteen 
hundred centuries, snatching with 
bare hands at a semblance of 
immortality. But if they did, they 
would be working against the 
sure and certain knowledge that 
it all would come to naught, for 
they knew in advance that no 



PROJECT MASTODON 



33 



such pyramid existed in historic 
time. 

Or they might set out to seek 
contemporary Man, hiking across 
four thousand miles of wilder- 
ness to Bering Strait and over 
into Asia. And having found con- 
temporary Man cowering in his 
caves, they might be able to help 
him immeasurably along the 
road to his great inheritance. Ex- 
cept that they’d never make it 
and even if they did, contem- 
porary Man undoubtedly would 
find some way to do them in and 
might eat them in the bargain. 

They came out of the woods 
and there was the cabin, just a 
hundred yards away. It crouched 
against the hillside above the 
spring, with the sweep of grass- 
land billowing beyond it to the 
slate-gray skyline. A trickle of 
smoke came up from the chim- 
ney and they saw the door was 
open. 

“Wes oughtn’t to leave it open 
that way,’’ said Cooper. “No tell- 
ing when a bear might decide to 
come visiting.” 

“Hey, Wes!” yelled Hudson. 

But there was no sign of him. 

Inside the cabin, a white sheet 
of paper lay on the table top. 
Hudson snatched it up and read 
it, with Cooper at his shoulder. 

Dear guys— I don’t want to get 
your hopes up again and have you 
disappointed. But I think I may 
have found the trouble. I’m going 



to try it out. If it doesn’t work. I’ll 
come back and bum this note and 
never say a word. But if you find the 
note, you’ll know it worked and I’ll 
be back to get you. Wes. 

Hudson crumpled the note in 
his hand. “The crazy fool!” 
“He’s gone off his rocker,” Coop- 
er said. “He just thought . .” 
The same thought struck them 
both and they bolted for the 
door. At the comer of the cabin, 
they skidded to a halt and stood 
there, staring at the ridge above 
them. 

The pyramid of rocks they’d 
built two months ago was gone!

T he crash brought Gen. Leslie 
Bowers (ret.) up out of bed — 
about two feet out of bed — old 
muscles tense, white mustache 
bristling. 

Even at his age, the general 
was a man of action. He flipped 
the covers back, swimg his feet 
out to the floor and grabbed the 
shotgun leaning against the wall. 

Muttering, he blundered out of 
the bedroom, marched across the 
dining room and charged into the 
kitchen. There, beside the door, 
he snapped on the switch that 
turned on the floodlights. He 
practically took the door off its 
hinges getting to the stoop and 
he stood there, bare feet gripping 
the planks, nightshirt billowing

in the wind, the shotgun poised 
and ready. 

“Whafs going on out there?” 
he bellowed. 

There was a tremendous pile of 
rocks resting where he’d parked 
his car. One crumpled fender and 
a drunken headlight peeped out 
of the rubble. 

A man was clambering care- 
fully down the jumbled stones, 
making a detour ‘o dodge the 
battered fender. 

The general pulled back the 
hammer of the gun and fought to 
control himself. 

The man reached the bottom 
of the pile and turned around to 
face him. The general saw that 
he was hugging something tight- 
ly to his chest. 

. “Mister,” the general told him, 
“your explanation better be a 
good one. That was a brand-new 
car. And this was the first time I 
was set for a night of sleep since 
my tooth quit aching.” 

The man just stood and looked 
at him. 

“Who in thunder are you?” 
roared the general. 

The man walked slowly for- 
ward. He stopped at the bottom 
of the stoop. 

“My name is Wesley Adams,” 
he said. “I’m—” 

“Wesley Adams!” howled the 
general. “My God, man, where 
have you been all these years?” 

“Well, I don’t imagine you’ll 



believe me, but the fact is . .” 
“We’ve been waiting for you. 
For twenty-five long years! Or, 
rather. I’ve been waiting for you. 
Those other idiots gave up. I’ve 
waited right here for you, Adams, 
for the last three years, ever since 
they called off the guard.” 

Adams gulped. “I’m sorry 
about the car. You see, it was this 
way . .” 

The general, he saw, was beam- 
ing at him fondly. 

“I had faith in you,” the gen- 
eral said. 

H e waved the shotgun by way 
of invitation. “Come on in. I 
have a call to make.” 

Adams stumbled up the stairs. 
“Move!” the general ordered, 
shivering. “On the double! You 
want me to catch my death of 
cold out here?” 

Inside, he fumbled for the 
lights and turned them on. He 
laid the shotgun across the_ kitch- 
en table and picked up the tele- 
phone. ' 

“Give me the White House at 
Washington,” he said. “Yes, I 
said the White House. The 
President? Naturally he’s the one 
I want to talk to. Yes, it’s 
all right. He won’t mind my call- 
ing him.” 

“Sir,” said Adams tentatively. 
The general looked up. “What 
is it, Adams? Go ahead and say 
it.”

“Did you say twenty-five 
years?” 

“That’s what I said. What were 
you doing all that time?” 

Adams grasped the table and 
hung on. “But it wasn’t . .” 
“Yes,” said the general to the 
operator. “Yes, I’ll wait.” 

He held his hand over the re- 
ceiver and looked inquiringly at 
Adams. “I imagine you’ll want 
the same terms as before.” 
“Terms?” 

“Sure. Recognition. Point Four 
Aid. Defense pact.” 

“I suppose so,” Adams said. 
“You got these saps across the 
barrel,” the general told him hap- 
pily. “You can get anything you 
want. You rate it, too, after what 
you’ve done and the bonehead 
treatment you got — ^but especially 
for not selling out.”

T he night editor read the bul- 
letin just off the teletype. 
“Well, what do you know!” he 
said. “We just recognized Masto- 
donia.” 

He looked at the copy chief. 
“Where the hell is Masto- 
donia?” he asked. 

The copy chief shrugged. 
“Don’t ask me. You’re the brains 
in this joint.” 

“Well, let’s get a map for the 
next edition,” said the night ed- 
itor.

T abby, the saber-tooth, 
dabbed playfully at Cooper 
with his mighty paw. 

Cooper kicked him in the ribs 
— an equally playful gesture. 
Tabby snarled at him. 

“Show your teeth at me, will 
you!” said Cooper. “Raised you 
from a kitten and that’s the grat- 
itude you show. Do it just once 
more and I’ll belt you in the 
chops.” 

Tabby lay down blissfully and 
began to wash his face. 

“Some day,” warned Hudson, 
“that cat will miss a meal and 
that’s the day you’ll be it.” 
“Gentle as a dove,” Cooper 
assured him. “Wouldn’t hurt a 
fly.” 

“Well, one thing about it, 
nothing dares to bother us with 
that monstrosity around.” 

“Best watchdog there ever was. 
Got to have something to guard 
all this stuff we’ve got. When 
Wes gets back, we’ll be million- 
aires. All those furs and ginseng 
and the ivory.” 

“If he gets back.” 

“He’ll be back. Quit your wor- 
rying.” 

“But it’s been five years,” 
Hudson protested. 

“He’ll be back. Something hap- 
pened, that’s all. He’s probably 
working on it right now. Could 
be that he messed up the time

setting when he repaired the unit 
or it might have been knocked 
out of kilter when Buster hit the 
helicopter. That would take a 
while to fix. I don’t worry that 
he won’t come back. What I can’t 
figiu'e out is why did he go and 
leave us?” 

“I’ve told you,” Hudson said. 
“He was afraid it wouldn’t 
work.” 

“There wasn’t any need to be 
scared of that. We never would 
have laughed at him.” 

“No. Of course we wouldn’t.” 
“Then what was he scared of?” 
Cooper asked. 

“If the unit failed and we knew 
it failed, Wes was afraid we’d 
try to make him see how hope- 
less and insane it was. And he 
knew we’d probably convince 
him and then all his hope would 
be gone. And he wanted to hang 
onto that, Johnny. He wanted to 
hang onto his hope even when 
there wasn’t any left.” 

“That doesn’t matter now,” 
said Cooper. “What counts is 
that he’ll come back. I can feel 
it in my bones.” 

And here’s another case, 
thought Hudson, of hope begging 
to be allowed to go on living. 



God, he thought, I wish I 
could be that blind! 

“Wes is working on it right 
now,” said Cooper confidently. 

XIV 

H e was. Not he alone, but a 
thousand others, working 
desperately, knowing that the 
time was short, working not 
alone for two men trapped in 
time, but for the peace they all 
had dreamed about — ^that the 
whole world had yearned for 
through the ages. 

For to be of any use, it was 
imperative that they could zero 
in the time machines they meant 
to build as an artilleryman would 
zero in a battery of guns, that 
each time machine would take its 
occupants to the same instant of 
the past, that their operation 
would extend over the same pe- 
riod of time, to the exact second. 

It was a problem of control 
and calibration — starting with a 
prototype that was calibrated, as 
its finest adjustment, for jumps 
of 50,000 years. 

Project Mastodon was finally 
under way.

Jaffa had the damning facts 



about Mars. Now all he had to 



do was make them fit the truthi 



T he Trusteeship Director 
fished out a pack of ciga- 
rettes and offered them to 
Jaffa Doane. “I heard your 
speech last night,” he said. “Cig- 
arette?” 

“I don’t smoke,” said Jaffa 
Doane. 



“It was a good speech.” The 
Director lit his cigarette thought- 
fully, flicked the match away. 
Doane waited with patience in 
his eyes — an expression that 
seemed very much out of place 
on the face of Jaffa Doane. But 
Doane had practiced patience

before the Director’s “invitation” 
had reached him that morning. 
He knew it was coming; you 
can’t tell blunt truths on a world 
hookup and not expect to make 
a stir. 

The Director said, “I’ve 
checked your record, Doane. It’s 
a good one. You have consistent- 
ly fought for a lot of things that 
I happen to believe in myself. 
Naturally, I think you’re off base 
this time, but I was with you on 
the Kaffirs, I was with you on 
the Ainus, I’ll be with you again. 
I’m sure. In fact, if you look it 
up in the books of your Equality 
League, you’ll find that I sent in 
my two dollars dues long ago.” 
He peered at Doane under his 
eyebrows and chuckled. “Don’t 
look so surprised.” 

“I can’t help it,” Doane said 
severely. “After what your ad- 
ministration has done to the 
Martians — ” 

“The Martians! Why, those — 
Never mind.” He clamped the 
words down in his throat. “Just 
what,” he demanded, “have we 
done to them?” 

Doane leaned forward. “Turn- 
ed them into savages! Exploited 
them, degraded them, reduced 
them to barbarism. Do you want 
the entire catalogue, sir? I know 
how the Mars Trusteeship has 
been run! The Administrators 
have made themselves gods, sir, 
gods! Their every whim is a com-

mandment. Thafs what you’ve 
done!” 

r^HE Director managed a smile, 
though his nostrils were flar- 
ing. “I said I heard your speech,” 
he reminded Doane. “You had 
some suggestions to make, didn’t 
you?” 

“I did,” said Doane proudly. 
“And among them, you sug- 
gested that we remove Adminis- 
trator Kellem and replace him 
with someone acceptable to the 
Equality League.” 

“It was. Kellem’s handling of 
the General Mercantile incident 
was — ” 

“I know,” the Director inter- 
rupted, and for the first time his 
smile relaxed. “I have here a ra- 
diogram from the Administration 
Comzone on Mars. Read it, Mr. 
Doane.” 

Doane took it suspiciously, but 
as he read, he began to beam.

I thought the stink from General 
Mercantile would drive him 
out!” 

The Director said in a level 
tone, “Kellem almost died last 
week, Doane.” 

“All right.” Doane shrugged. 
“It makes no difference. In any 
case, I demand to be consulted 
in choosing his successor.” 

The Director eyed him. “You 
do, do you?” He pressed a but- 
ton on his desk and said, “Ask 
Ne Mleek to come in.” A sexy 
contralto replied, “Yes, sir.” 

The Director looked at Doane. 
“Ever seen a Martian?” he asked. 
“You take such an interest in 
them, I wonder if you’ve ever 
met one. Face-to-face^ I mean; 
the pictures don’t quite do them 
justice. No? Well, it’s about time 
you did.” 

He stood up and gestured to- 
ward the door. 

“Jaffa Doane,” he said, “meet 
Ne Mleek.” 

Doane rose and turned to see 
who was coming in. He swal- 
lowed. “How do you do,” he 
managed to say. 

A SUPPRESSED sighing 
sound came from the thing 
that dragged itself through the 
doorway. Doane thought it 
formed words in a sort of airless 
whisper, the sound that might be 
made by a man with a slashed 
throat. 



It went: “Gl’d t’ n’w y— ” The 
vowels were almost inaudible, 
the consonants as though they 
were being forced out against a 
gag. It was English, all right: 
you could make it out if you 
tried. 

But if the thing’s words were 
understandable, its expression 
was not. As the Director had 
said, you had to meet a Martian 
in the flesh: photos did not give 
more than a hint. On the 
squashed, whitely translucent 
face was what Doane thought a 
grin of savage glee, while the 
huge dull eyes held inexpressible 
sorrow. Neither interpretation, 
Doane told himself, meant 
much; that was anthrophomor- 
phic thinking, and dangerous. 
But those looks took a little get- 
ting used to, all the same. 

“Don’t try to shake hands with 
him, Mr. Doane,” said the Di- 
rector. “He hasn’t any.” 

It was true. Four supple, ar- 
ticulated tentacles waved around 
the Martian’s midsection, but 
there were no hands or arms. The 
pear-shaped body was supported 
on stubby little legs which had 
neither knee nor ankle, as far as 
Jaffa Doane could see. 

The Director was saying, “Ne 
Mleek is the Martian legate here 
in Washington and, like Kellem, 
the strain of an alien environ- 
ment has hurt his health. He’ll 
be going back to Mars on your 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE CANDLE LIGHTER 



41 



ship, Doane, and you’ll be work- 
ing with him.” 

“Working with him?” Doane 
gasped. 

The Director allowed himself 
a look of surprise. “Haven’t you 
figured it out yet, Doane? Since 
we must replace Kellem anyhow, 
we have decided to grant the 
Equality League’s request. We 
are picking a man for the post 
that the League is certain to ap- 
prove — because he is the presi- 
dent of it. I mean you, Mr. 
Doane.” 

“Me? Me? But I’ve never been 
on Mars!” 

“In eighteen days,” said the 
Director, “you will no longer be 
able to make that statement. 
That is, unless you refuse the 
appointment.” 

Jaffa Doane stood up and 
there was corrosive anger in his 
voice. “You’d like that, wouldn’t 
you? You want me to turn it 
down, so you can tell the news 
services what a lot of hot air the 
president of the Equality League 
really is. Well, I can recognize a 
shoddy little political trick when 
I see one. You hand me a politi- 
cal hot potato, throw me in on a 
job that your fat-cats have finally 
messed up to the point where 
there are riots and investigations. 
If things go wrong. I’m the goat 
and that shuts up the Equality 
League. If things go right, your 
administration gets the credit.” 



“I take it you refuse,” said the 
Director. 

“No, sir! I don’t refuse! It’s a 
cheap trick-^and I’ll make you 
wish you’d never thought of it. 
I accept!” 

He looked over bis shoulder at 
the Martian who had become, in 
the space of a heartbeat, one of 
his charges. Jaffa Doane couldn’t 
help wincing a little — they did 
look so much like ragged corpses! 

But he said, “Come along, Ne 
Mleek. We’re going to your 
home.” 

■f^OR more than a million mem- 
bers of the Equality League, 
Jaffa Doane was a severe and 
shining leader; his words were 
trumpet calls and his surging 
drive for justice was a bright 
flame. One or two of the mem- 
bers, however, took a more per- 
sonal view of their president, 
among them a young lady whose 
name was Ruth-Ann Wharton. 
On the books, she was listed as 
Mr. Doane’s personal secretary, 
but it had been several months 
now since she had first begun to 
contemplate a promotion for her- 
self. 

It had occurred to her that the 
eighteen-day flight to Mars on 
the shuttle rocket might provide 
the time and leisure for Jaffa 
Doane to notice just what a pearl 
he had as a secretary. But it had 
been a disappointing voyage; 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Doane had kept to his stateroom 
most of the way. 

A hatful of hours out of Mars- 
port, Ruth-Aun was banging on 
her boss’s stateroom door. “Jaf- 
fa,” she called plaintively, and 
not for the first time, “Ne Mleek 
and another Martian are waiting 
for you. Please hurry.” 

Doane’s low, controlled voice 
said, “I’ll be there in a moment. 
Miss Wharton.” 

She scowled at the door. “I’ll 
give you exactly one minute.” 
But she didn’t give him that 
much. She hammered again. 
“Jaffa, they’re waiting.” 

Pause. Then the calm, relaxed 
voice. “Yes, of course. One mo- 
ment.” 

Ruth-Ann stamped her foot. 
“Oh, darn you!” she said and did 
what she had wanted to do in the 
first place. She turned the knob 
and walked in. “They’ve been 
waiting half an hour and Ne 
Mleek says it’s very important.” 
The room was in semi-dark- 
ness, lit only by the light from 
the corridor outside. From the 
rumpled heap of bedclothing, 
Jaffa Doane’s voice said placidly, 
“I’m aware of that. Miss Whar- 
ton.” 

Her hands found the light 
switch. The bedclothing erupted 
.and Jaffa Doane sat up, leaning 
on an elbow, blinking at her. 

“What?” he croaked blearily. 
“Say, haven’t I asked you to call 



me only from the outside?” 

“You have,” she said hotly, 
flinging back the ray-screen on 
the port. The tempered glass was 
treated to filter out most of the 
glare, but the direct sunlight lit 
up the little room like a movie 
set. 

“Get up,” she ordered. “If 
you’re not outside and fully 
dressed in five minutes. I’m com- 
ing back and I’ll dress you my- 
self. Anyway, Jaffa, it looks as 
if it really is important. Ne 
Mleek is sighing and talking 
about your duty to your job. 
And the other Martian — ^well, it’s 
hard to tell, everything consid- 
ered, but he looks sick.” 

“Sick?” Jaffa Doane yawned 
and scratched. “Sick how?” 

Ruth-Ann shook her head. 
“Come on out and see for your- 
self.” 

T OOKING hazily at his face 
in the mirror of the tiny 
washroom as he shaved, Jaffa 
Doane decided that Ruth-Ann, 
after all, was right. He did have 
a tendency to be — not difficult, 
exactly, not grumpy or nasty, 
but a little hard to wake up in 
the mornings. And besides, this 
was an important day. He was 
about to meet his charges. He 
wiped off the depilatory and 
stubble and stood erect, eyes 
burning into his own reflection in 
the mirror. 



THE CANDLE LIGHTER

The sound of his stateroom 
door made him jump. ‘Tm com- 
ing right out!” he yelled. 

In the room that had been 
htted out as his office for the 
duration of the trip— and which 
he had hardly set foot in — ^Ne 
Mleek and Ruth-Ann were wait- 
ing. With them was another 
Martian and, looking at him, 
Jaffa Doane knew what the girl 
had meant when she said there 
was something wrong. A strap- 
ping young adult Martian, with 
a life expectancy of hundreds of 
years, somewhat resembles a 
wilting fungus; but this one 
looked rotten. 

“Good morning, Ne Mleek,” 
Jaffa Doane said courteously. 
“What can I do for you?” 

The Martian’s wheezy voice 
was somewhat easier to under- 
stand in the spaceship’s half-and- 
half atmosphere — pressure an 
even eight pounds to the square 
inch, composition largely helium 
— than it had been when he was 
laboring to force his voice into 
the dense Earth air. “Indeed you 
can, honored sir. Gadian Pluur 
has the sickness and wishes Your 
Honor to cure him in the way 
that is known.” 

Jaffa Doane’s eyebrows went 
up. “Cure him? You mean you 
want me to call a doctor?” 

“Ah, no,” whispered the Mar- 
tian. “Your Honor will cure him 
yourself, surely.” 



Ruth-Ann was signaling. “You 
don’t know what he wants, do 
you?” she said in a low tone. 
“Good heavens, no.” 

S HE nodded smugly. “He 
wants you to touch this other 
one. That’s all, just touch him.” 
“Touch him?” Doane stared at 
the Martian. “Ne Mleek, are you 
out of your mind?” 

“Not so,” the Martian whis- 
pered indignantly, the mad face 
working. “It is our custom, as is 
known. The Administrator Kel- 
lem and the Admiral Rosenman 
who was his assistant have al- 
ways healed those ill of the sick- 
ness.” 

“Barbarous,” marveled Jaffa 
Doane, forgetting to be angry. 
“And you, an intelligent man — 
an intelligent Martian like you, 
you believe in this?” 

“There is nothing to believe or 
disbelieve,” sighed Ne Mleek, his 
tentacles agitated, the pale eyes 
desolate. “It is our custom since 
the first of your honored admin- 
istrators came.” 

Doane shook his head wonder- 
ingly. 

“Touch him,” Ruth-Ann ad- 
vised. 

“But—” 

“Go ahead, touch him!” 
Doane frowned. “Miss Whar- 
ton, this is a matter of principle. 
I am responsible not only to the 
Trusteeship Director, but to the 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



League, and I certainly couldn’t 
justify — ” 

“Touch him\” The girl’s face 
was set. 

Doane was about to reply, but 
the ship gave a gentle course- 
correcting lurch and everyone in 
the little room staggered slightly 
—everyone but the sick Martian, 
Gadian Pluur, who staggered 
halfway across the room and 
brushed against Doane’s fingers. 

Jaffa Doane jerked back his 
hand. It had been a curious sen- 
sation, almost like an electric 
shock, but not localized — he 
could feel a tiny tingle up his 
backbone and at the base of his 
skull. 

“Thanks to Your Honor,” 
whispered Ne Mleek. 

And the two Martians slipped 
slowly out, leaving Jaffa Doane 
staring frustratedly after them. 

“■pUT I have a speech all 
" ready,” Doane objected 
reasonably. “It’s not just a lot of 
glowing promises and empty 
words, but facts. It tells how I 
am going to put a stop to — ” he 
hesitated over the word — “the 
indiscretions of the previous Ad- 
ministrators.” 

Admiral Rosenman said cheer- 
fully, “Fine.” He was a chunky 
man with a big head of curly 
white hair. And he wore the se- 
vere uniform as though he had 
been born with it on. “But you 



can’t get out of the Conjunction 
Offering.” 

“That’s nothing short of miu'- 
der! And my speech — ” 

“It’s merely an execution, Mr. 
Doane. The Martian has had his 
trial and he has been convicted. 
It’s up to you.” 

“But I’m not a hangman!” 

“You’re the Earth Administra- 
tor on Mars and one of your du- 
ties is carrying out the decisions 
of the Martian courts.” 

Doane glowered. "What’s he 
convicted of?” he demanded sus- 
piciously. 

“What’s the difference? Under 
the Martian laws, it’s a crime 
punishable by death. They call it 
bad thinking.” 

“Bad thinking.” Doane shook 
his head and walked over to the 
window of the Ad-Building office 
that was now his. The orange 
sandscape, dotted with smoke- 
trees, hurt his eyes; it was the 
Martian idea of a formal park, 
in the heart of the little city of 
Marsport, and it was a great 
honor to have one’s office look- 
ing out over it. Or so the Mar- 
tians thought. 

They also thought it was an 
honor to be the executioner in 
what seemed to have some of the 
aspects of a ritual murder. 

“I can’t even see the conjunc- 
tion of the moons,” Doane said 
peevishly. 

“The Martians can. Both 



THE CANDLE LIGHTER 



45 



moons are perfectly visible to 
them.” 

“And this Conjunction Offer- 
ing is traditional? What did they 
do back forty or fifty years ago, 
before the first Earthmen got 
here?” 

Admiral Rosenman shrugged 
and glanced at the clock. “You 
ought to be getting ready,” he 
said. “Am I dismissed?” 

“You’re dismissed,” D o a n e 
said ungraciously and frowned at 
the Admiral’s back as he left, 
using the weaving, flat-footed 
Mars walk that Doane had not 
yet mastered. 

He sat down at his desk, care- 
fully allowing for the light gravi- 
tation — and misjudged it, as he 
had six times before, and bumped 
his shin against the desk, as he 
had six times before. 

R UTH-ANN Wharton said 
sympathetically, “It takes a 
little getting used to. Do you 
want me to come to the Conjunc- 
tion Offering with you?” 

“No!” 

“There’s no need to take my 
skin off.” 

He said stiffly, “I am sorry. 
Miss Wharton. Perhaps I’m a lit- 
tle upset.” 

“I understand, Jaffa.” 

“It didn’t seem like this back 
on Earth,” he said morosely, 
staring out at the smoke-trees. 
“You haven’t heard the worst of 



it. Miss Wharton. Not only do I 
have to slit some poor devil’s 
throat this evening — not only am 
I expected to perform the laying 
on of hands like somebody from 
the Dark Ages — ^but look at this!” 
He turned to his desk and picked 
up a thick sheaf of papers. “Du- 
ties for the Earth Administrator 
— me\ The most ridiculous mass 
of superstitious nonsense I ever 
saw. If this is the way Kellem 
kept the Martians down, I can 
understand why there were riots 
at the General Mercantile base.” 
“At Niobe? But those were 
Earthmen involved in the brawl, 
Jaffa, not Martians.” 

“How do you know?” he asked 
pugnaciously. “Because Kellem’s 
publicity men said so? All we 
know for sure is that there was 
trouble. There’s bound to be 
trouble when you try to keep an 
intelligent, civilized race like Ne 
Mleek’s down with barbarous 
tricks like these.” 

He glanced at the list and 
flinched. “Well, there’s an end to 
it,” he said grimly. “Kellem’s 
gone and I’m here now. I’ll be 
at the Conjunction Ceremony to- 
night, all right, and I’ll start 
things rolling right then and 
there. You’ll see! I’m telling you. 
Miss Wharton, Mars is going to 
— ^what’s the matter?” he de- 
manded irritably. “You look like 
you’ve got a question.” 

The girl nodded emphatically.

“I have. Why do you call me 
Miss Wharton instead of Ruth- 
Ann?” 

ri^HE Conjunction Offering was 
to take place in what the 
Martians had named the Park of 
Sparse Beauty. 

“It’s sparse enough,” Jaffa 
Doane said from the rostrum, 
watching the Martians gather 
before him. “But is it beautiful 
enough?” 

Admiral Rosenman asked sour- 
ly, “Are you ready for the cere- 
mony?” 

“Oh, quite ready,” said Jaffa 
Doane. He started to hum to 
himself with a satisfied air, but 
you do not hum with oxygen 
plugs in your nostrils. He 
coughed and choked, and looked 
at the Admiral suspiciously. But 
the Admiral wasn’t laughing. 

The Admiral didn’t think he 
had very much to laugh about. 
He had been on duty on Mars 
for seven years, surviving five 
Administrators, only one of 
whom had completed his three- 
year term. He had formed cer- 
tain conclusions about the Mar- 
tians and one of them was that 
they weren’t too likely to get 
along well with the likes of Jaffa 
Doane . 

It was dark and the Martians 
carried torches — not flaming 
brands, for flames do not thrive 
in Mars’ thin atmosphere, but 

THE CANDLE LIGHTER 



glowing balls of punk from the 
little bushes that grew wild in 
the wide reaches between set- 
tlements. The scene was hardly 
brightly illuminated; Martian 
eyes were not human eyes, 
though, and to them, Doane, re- 
alized, it might have been bright 
as day. 

He looked fruitlessly at the 
spot in the sky where the two 
moons were supposed to be in 
conjunction with a particular 
star. One moon was visible, the 
other not. The star might or 
might not be visible — ^with all 
the stars in the Martian sky, one 
more or less made very little dif- 
ference. But to the Martians, of 
course, .with their very much 
more acute vision, both moons 
were as visible as Luna from 
Earth and each star of the tens 
of thousands was an individual 
in its own right. 

J AFFA Doane sighed. It was 
hard remembering all the dif- 
ferences between Martians and 
Earthmen — and trying to re- 
member, at the same time, the 
diamond-clear principles of the 
Equality League, which said that 
the differences were as noth- 
ing .. 

There was no sound of trum- 
pets, no burst of prompted ap- 
plause from the idly drifting 
audience, but all of a sudden the 
ceremony seemed to have begun. 

47 



Ne Mleek appeared on the high 
platform where the Earth party 
was standing. 

“In three of your minutes and 
eleven seconds, as is known to 
Your Honor,” he said, “the con- 
junction will occur. This is he 
who is to die.” He stepped aside 
to reveal another Martian, who 
gestured courteously with his 
tentacles. 

“This is Fnihi Bel.” 

The condemned Martian said 
politely, “It is an honor to meet 
Your Honor. I am most sorry for 
the circumstances.” 

Doane looked embarrassedly at 
Ruth-Ann and the Admiral. He 
had had no lessons in how Jack 
Ketch greeted his clients; there 
was no precedent in his expe- 
rience with the Equality League 
to guide him in the proper con- 
duct of the maul-man meeting 
the steer at the top of the slip- 
pery chute. 

But the Martian was tactful. 
He said, “Since I shall not have 
the power afterward, let me now 
thank Your Honor for the great- 
est of favors.” 

“For killing you?” Doane 
blurted, scandalized. He made a 
face expressing his mood about 
the enforced subjection of the 
Martians; it was wasted on the 
Martians who expressed their 
feelings with formalized gestures 
of the tentacles, but not on Ad- 
miral Rosenman, who licked his 



lips and started to speak. 

But not soon enough. “Fnihi 
Bel,” Doane said compassion- 
ately, “under the authority vest- 
ed in me as Administrator, I 
grant a stay of execution pend- 
ing review of your case. You 
shall not die tonight.” 

A dmiral Rosenman swore 
and looked helplessly at 
Ruth-Ann. “If the crazy idiot 
had only talked it over first! No, 
not him! He made up his mind 
ten years before he ever saw a 
Martian and nothing’s going to 
change it, especially facts!” 
“What facts?” asked Ruth- 
Ann hotly. “You never told him 
anything.” 

“It’s all in the files.” 

“Which he hasn’t had a chance 
to look at. Honestly, Admiral, 
you’re unreasonable.” Ruth-Ann 
looked fretfully out the window. 
It was nearly daybreak; the 
sharp Martian dawn had popped 
into light over the horizon min- 
utes before. “Do you suppose 
he’s all right?” 

The Admiral growled and 
flipped the switch on the inter- 
com. “Any word?” 

The uniformed man whose 
face appeared in the screen said, 
“Not yet, sir. The Administrator 
was seen about an hour ago near 
the Shacks. A detail has gone to 
search the area, but they haven’t 
reported in yet.” 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“All right,” the Admiral grum- 
bled, clicking off. 

“What are the Shacks?” Ruth- 
Ann wanted to know. 

“Abandoned part of town. The 
Martians gave it up years ago. 
Nobody lives there now. Un- 
pleasant place. Serves him right, 
the—” 

“Watch yourself!” Ruth- Ann 
warned. “He’s your boss!” 

The Admiral glowered at her, 
but stopped. He yawned and 
stretched. “Not used to staying 
up all night any more,” he said. 
“Kind of takes it out of me, 
but — Go ahead!” he snapped as 
the intercom called his name. 

“Administrator D o a n e has 
been located by the search party, 
sir,” said the officer. “Any or- 
ders?” 

“Hold him there,” roared the 
Admiral. “And get a car in front 
of the door in thirty seconds — 
I’m going to meet him!” 

He clicked off the switch as 
Ruth-Ann corrected, “We’re go- 
ing to meet him. Admiral! If that 
big stuffed-shirt thinks he can 
scare me out of my wits and stir 
up every Martian from here 
to—” 

“Hey, wait a minute!” the Ad- 
miral protested. “I thought you 
wouldn’t let me call him names!” 

“That’s you,” Ruth-Ann said 
shortly. “The rules are different 
for me. Come on. Admiral. What 
are you waiting for?” 



r^HEY found Earth Adminis- 
trator Jaffa Doane sitting on 
the ramp before an abandoned 
and decrepit Martian dwelling, 
staring into space. Admiral 
Rosenman dismissed the detail 
and helped the Administrator 
into the pressurized car. Doane’s 
attention was elsewhere. Rosen- 
man had to remind him even to 
take the oxygen plugs out of his 
nostrils. 

“Thanks,” said Doane absent- 
ly- 

And, after a pause, “I messed 
it up, didn’t I?” 

“You did,” the Admiral told 
him. “You messed it up enough 
to put forty-eight Martians in 
the hospital — ^the Earth hospi- 
tal.” 

Doane blinked. 

“For physical injuries,” the 
Admiral explained. “The Mar- 
tians don’t ordinarily hospitalize 
for that; a couple of hours of 
what they call good thinking and 
they can patch almost anything 
that’s wrong with themselves. 
But these were pretty well beat 
up, mostly from running into 
moving vehicles, and I don’t 
think there’s a Martian within 
fifty miles that’s capable of good 
thinking right now.” 

Jaffa Doane shook his head. “I 
don’t get it,” he complained. “All 
I did was try to save a man’s 
life. Maybe I was wrong — I don’t 
know. But how could it make so 



THE CANDLE LIGHTER

much trouble? Rioting like crazy 
people. Getting themselves run 
over — and all because of a thing 
like that. I could understand it 
if they were ignorant natives, 
only they’re not ignorant; they 
have a civilization of their own. 
How can these silly customs 
mean so much to them?” 

The Admiral exploded, “Don’t 
you understand yet? It is not just 
a silly custom! They were crazy, 
all right, but not because you vi- 
olated a silly tabu — because you 
did the thing that was bound to 
drive them insane. You pushed 
them across the brink. They were 
sick. Infected by you.” 

“But—” 

“Don’t argue with me! Sick- 
ness is not only of the body; even 
an Earthman can have mental 
illnesses, too. And Martians have 
no other kind. Shock them and 
they get sick. When they’re sick, 
they need to be healed. If you 
break a leg, you splint it; if a 
Martian’s mind is injured, it 
needs to be splinted with a 
stronger, stabler mind. 

“Think back to the ship, 
Doane! When Ne Mleek begged 
you to touch the other Martian, 
did you think it was only a prim- 
itive custom? It was not. It was 
splinting and healing. When you 
made contact with him, his mind 
was braced against yours and 
you were the one who helped him 
grow well.” 



I^OANE swallowed. “All right,” 
he said reasonably. “Grant- 
ed. But that’s one thing and mur- 
der is another. What about the 
one I was supposed to kill?” 
“The same principle, Doane. 
Even a Martian doesn’t live for- 
ever, and when he is too sick to 
be cured, he has to die. The only 
way a Martian can die is by be- 
ing physically destroyed. He 
can’t kill himself. No Martian 
can. He can’t be killed by an- 
other Martian — ^the shock would 
destroy him. So you’re elected, 
Doane — the strongest, stablest 
being on Mars — the Earth Ad- 
ministrator.” 

Doane protested, “But what 
about the time before the Earth- 
men were here? How did they 
manage?” 

Rosenman shrugged. “They 
didn’t have Earthmen to do the 
dirty work, so they used Mar- 
tians, of course.” 

“But you said — ” 

“I know what I said. Take a 
look around you, Doane.” He 
gestured out the window at the 
rickety, abandoned buildings 
called the Shacks. 

Compared with the clean, 
functional lines of the rest of the 
Martian architecture, the Shacks 
were a hideous blot. They leaned 
and they staggered. They were 
put together at random distances 
out of random materials. They 
looked unfit for even human hab-

itation, miich less Martian. 

“This is where they lived, the 
Outcasts,” Rosenman said. “The 
strongest and healthiest of every 
generation, selected by rigorous 
tests and segregated into a caste 
of Healers. It was an honor to 
be a Healer, Doane — the great- 
est, most tragic honor that a 
Martian could attain. Read the 
Martian literature. It has noble 
stories in it, the Healers who sac- 
rificed themselves for others. 
They were untouchables. There 
were a couple of hundred of them 
all the time, right here in the 
Shacks, injured mentally every 
time they had to put an incura- 
ble out of his misery, until they 
were beyond repair and had to 
be destroyed after a few years of 
agonizing service.” . 

“And when we came, we be- 
came the untouchables?” 

Rosenman hesitated. “Well, 
not exactly,” he said, a little less 
roughly. “We took over the func- 
tions of the Healers to some ex- 
tent, yes. After all, we Earthmen 
aren’t as sensitive; and just for 
that reason, we’re more stable. 
But, of course, even we crack up 
when the pressure is too great. 
Suppose the picture was differ- 
ent, Doane; suppose it was the 
Martians who were stronger and 
stabler, and suppose they came to 
Earth and showed us a way of 
emptying our asylums. 

“We use psychiatrists because 



they’re all we have — all the Mar- 
tians had were the Healers. But 
the Healers weren’t altogether 
satisfactory, as you can see, be- 
cause it’s an expensive cure that 
merely passes the disease on to 
someone else. Our psychiatrists 
aren’t as effective as they should 
be, either — ^they’re human, too; 
they have their own problems, 
which seriously interfere with 
and become intermingled with 
those of their patients. 

“If the Martians had come to 
us with a real cure, not the half- 
cure that psychiatrists are capa- 
ble of, we’d be stupid to go on 
using inadequate therapy. And 
the Martians aren’t stupid. In 
fact, that's the mistake you and 
your Equality League made.” 

T he Administrator flared, 
“That’s enough, Rosenman! 
The Equality League never — ” 
“Wait a minute! Admit it, 
Doane — you came here all full of 
red-hot ideas about how the 
Earth masters should be kind to 
their Martian slaves. No, don’t 
argue; that’s how it looked to 
you. Think it over. But the Mar- 
tians aren’t slaves, you see. In 
many ways, they’re more cul- 
tured and smarter and a lot more 
sensitive than you and I. In some 
ways, in fact, they remind me of 
my grandfather.” 

“Your what7” Doane gasped, 
baffled. 



THE CANDLE LIGHTER 



51 



“My grandfather. He was a 
very religious man,” the Ad- 
miral explained reminiscently. 
“Every Friday night, we’d have 
the candles for the Sabbath, and 
— well, I don’t know how famil- 
iar you are with the ritual,- but 
on the Sabbath, the truly ortho- 
dox aren’t allowed to work from 
sundown to sundown. Not eyen 
lighting the candles. So my 
grandfather used to hire an Irish 
kid from the neighborhood to be 
our candle lighter — a shabbas 
goy, he called him. 

“Marty Madden, the boy’s 
name was. Marty wasn’t any bet- 
ter than we were or any worse — I 
don’t think my grandfather ever 
thought that. But he was, in that 
one way, different-, he could do 
something for us that we weren’t 
allowed to do for ourselves. So, 
naturally, he did it. Just as you 
and I, Doane, do things for the 
Martians that they can’t do for 
themselves.” 

The Admiral started the car 
for the trip back. 

“I used to know Marty pretty 
well,” he said. “We went to the 
same school during the week. In 
a way, I was sorry for him — he 
missed all the ‘fun of the feasts 
and so on. In another way, I en- 
vied him, because he could do 
things I couldn’t. But I never 
thought that so many years later, 
forty million miles from Mosh- 
olu Parkway, I’d be taking his 



job away from him . .” 

They rode back to the Admin- 
istration Building in silence for 
most of the way, while Jaffa 
Doane digested some of the most 
ill-tasting realizations of his ca- 
reer. 

As the building came into 
sight, he shook himself and sat 
up. 

“All right,” he said humbly, 
“I’ll start all over. Make believe 
I landed this morning. Where do 
I start?” 

R OSENMAN smiled and 
leaned over to pat his shoul- 
der. “You’ll do,” he promised. 
“Where you start is in the clinic. 
You’ll find about fifty Martians 
with some degree of shock, need- 
ing the healing touch of a sound 
mind — like yours. It won’t be too 
bad. You’ll have a headache aft- 
erward, but you can take a minor 
discomfort like that, can’t you?” 
“Gladly!” Doane said. “That’s 
the least I can do. I want to apol- 
ogize to both of you. You, too, 
Ruth-Ann. I’ve been about as big 
a self-centered, wrong-headed — ” 
She cut him off. “Oh, don’t get 
all wound up. You’re a bit of a 
phony, heaven knows — ” she ig- 
nored the strangled noise he 
made — “but there are worse. 
Deep down inside, you’re quite a 
guy. You wouldn’t be as much of 
a man as you are if you didn’t 
have a little ham in you, and a 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



touch of pig-headedness, too. I’ve 
given the matter a lot of thought, 
you see.” 

Rosenman grinned at Doane’s 
expression. “She’s right,” he 
agreed. “Between us, we’ll get 
you straightened out, so don’t 
worry about it. Two more years 
here ought to do it. Basically, 
your ideas are right — ^the Mar- 
tians ought to learn to get by on 
their own feet. You can start 
finding out how they can do it. 
It’ll be good for you. When the 



two years of your term are up, 
you’ll go home with a better, 
more human understanding of 
what’s what, ready to setde down 
to a normal, productive existence 
on Earth with your wife and 
family.” 

Doane yelped, “Hold on there! 
I haven’t got a wife, much less a 
family!” 

Ruth -Ann patted his arm re- 
assuringly. “You’re not home 
yet,” she said.

instance, and Sturgeon, for another. We've given you two exciting Sturgeons 
in quick succession (one in this issue) and we're hauling off to offer you 
another next month— HURRICANE TRIO, a novelet that's a flaring pinwheel 
of ideas and emotions or, to follow the title, a literary storm that blows down 
a lot of intellectual deadwood and reveals a bright path through a fresh 
green forest of concepts. The pibse here may seem enthusiastically impene- 
trable (true, though justified) and for a very simple reason— the story can't 
be described except in its own terms. And you wouldn't want a fine reading 
experience spoiled by being told who does what and why and what happens, 
except perhaps this much; The story opens with Yancey, who had died once,

DEATH OF THE SUN 

O NE of the first books I 
ever bought — a mixture 
of curiosity and nostalgia 
caused me to buy another copy 
some ten years ago, my first hav- 
ing been lost — ^was a small volume 
by the German astronomer, M. 
Wilhelm Meyer, called World’s 
End. It was paperbound, with a 
melancholy cover painting which 
carried out the theme. There a 
small group of emaciated hu- 
mans huddled in the snow near a 
dead tree, and low in the sky was 
an enormous deep-red sun. 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




It was the same basic idea 
which had been painted with 
words by H. G. Wells in his 
Time Machine. You probably re- 
member the story: After having 
seen and experienced the end of 
the human race on a trip into the 
future, the Time Traveler lets his 
machine race far, far ahead. At 
first, there is the “blinking suc- 
cession of day and night” to 
which he has grown accustomed 
during earlier time trips, but as 
the machine continues into the 
future, things slowly change : 
“The band of light that had 
indicated the sun had long since 
disappeared; for, the sun had 
ceased to set — it simply rose and 
fell in the west, and grew ever 
broader and more red. All trace 
of the moon had vanished. The 
circling of the stars, growing 
slower and slower, had given 
place to creeping points of light. 
At last, some time before I 
stopped, the sun, red and very 
large, halted motionless upon the 
horizon, a vast dome glowing with 
a dull heat, and now and then 
suffering a momentary extinction. 
At one time it had for a little 
while glowed more brilliantly 
again, but it speedily reverted to 
its sullen red heat. I perceived by 
this slowing down of its rising 
and setting that the work of the 
tidal drag was done. The earth 
had come to rest with one face 
to the sun . .” 



I F I saw this old German paint- 
ing or read the Time Machine 
for the first time now, I could 
date both painting and story from 
this one fact. Both would have to 
fall into the period from roughly 
1880 to 1900, because of this dy- 
ing red sun which looks so much 
larger because the Earth has 
moved closer to it along the tight 
spiral of a steadily shrinking or- 
bit. Actually, the story was writ- 
ten in 1895 and the picture was 
painted in 1903 — only ten years 
later, the writer would have been 
doubtful and the painter would 
have picked something else from 
the book. 

The very question of whether 
the Sun might one day die was 
still relatively new when Wells 
actually wrote, strange as that 
may seem to us. It had been the 
subject of doubtful speculation 
and worried calculations for only 
a few decades. In earlier days, 
that question simply did not ex- 
ist and we don’t even have to go 
back to the time of Homer when 
the Sun was the chariot of the 
sun-god to find it lacking. While 
people had thought about the end 
of the “world” on and off in olden 
days, the possible end of the Sun 
had never been considered. 

None of the Greek philosophers 
concerned themselves with this 
problem. The Roman writers had 
far more fnundane things to con- 
sider. The Bible even stated, by

implication, the opposite: “while 
the earth remaineth . summer 
and winter, and day and night 
shall not cease.” 

Nor did the astronomical rev- 
olution started by Nicholas Co- 
pernicus change the picture. What 
did begin to change the attitude 
was not philosophical ideas, but 
facts which were uncovered be- 
cause of the spare-time activities 
of one Jan Lippershey in the 
Netherlands, which resulted in 
the invention of the telescope. In 
December, 1610, it was found for 
the first time that the Sun was 
literally not spotless. 

The man who usually is cred- 
ited with the discovery of the 
Sun spots is the pastor David Fa- 
bricius, but part of the credit 
should go to his son Johannes, 
for father and son worked to- 
gether in observing the skies with 
their recently acquired “optick 
tube.” Johannes, in fact, saw it 
first. 

The Sun, he wrote later, did 
not look as clear and smooth as 
he had expected. “It seemed to 
have various kinds of roughnesses 
and unevennesses, even at the rim. 
As I watched carefully, an un- 
expected darkish spot showed it- 
self, not at all small as compared 
to the size of the Sun. I thought 
that drifting clouds caused the 
spot.” 

Even after reassuring himself 
“about ten times” that the spot 



could not be a cloud, “I did not 
trust myself completely and call- 
ed my father . .” The father- 
and-son team not only discovered 
the Sun spots, but, by observing 
them, the rotation of the Sun. 

B efore David Fabricius had 
published the findings, a Jes- 
uit priest. Father Christoph 
Scheiner, in Ingolstadt, saw sev- 
eral Sun spots. As required by his 
order, Scheiner reported his find 
to his superior Buseaeus, who lis- 
tened carefully, thought for a 
while and said: “My son, I have 
read all the writings of Aristotle 
several times from beginning to 
end and can assure you that I 
found nothing in them which says 
what you tell. Go and calm your- 
self; be assured that what you 
believe to be spots in the Sun are 
flaws of your glasses or your 
eyes.” * 

* This is not quite as bad as what 
was done some 45 years later. C'-ristian 
Huyghens in the Netherlands had in- 
vented a new method for grinding and 
polishing lens. He built himself a tel- 
escope and promptly discovered Titan, 
Saturn’s largest moon. He just as 
promptly discontinued his observa- 
tions, reasoning that there were six 
planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
Jupiter and Saturn) and now also six 
moons, that of Earth, the four of Ju- 
piter discovered by Galilei and the 
one of Saturn he had discovered. Since 
the number of moons could not be 
larger than the number of planets, they 
obviously had all been found!

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Sun’s corona was discov- 
ered, too, as soon as a suitable 
eclipse occurred. It was, of course, 
elementary knowledge even then 
that an eclipse was the result of 
the Moon moving across the line 
of sight from the E^rth to the 
Sun. The question was which of 
the two was the possessor of the 
corona. 

Around the year 1700, Giacomo 
Filippo Maraldi, a nephew of the 
great Jean Dominique Cassini, 
and famous as an astronomer in 
his own right, stated as his opin- 
ion that the corona was the at- 
mosphere of the Sun which 
suddenly became visible during 
a total eclipse. But the majority 
of his colleagues considered it 
much more probable and “reason- 
able” that the corona was the 
atmosphere of the Moon, which 
was illuminated for good visi- 
bility only if the Sun stood di- 
rectly behind it. 

The question was solved by 
elimination: The more the Moon 
was observed, the clearer it be- 
came that the Moon did not have 
an atmosphere worth that name. 
Hence the corona had to belong 
to the Sun. 

Yes, but what were the Sun 
spots? 

Galileo Galilei believed they 
were black — or at least dark — 
clouds that were high above the 
luminous surface of the Sun. Oth- 
ers did not contradict this view. 



but were more specific — ^these 
were the dark clouds that formed 
above gigantic volcanoes in erup- 
tion. 

A few decades later, about 1670, 
it was Cassini who turned the idea 
around. The Sun spots were not 
dark clouds of one kind or an- 
other, but just the opposite: 
When a storm tore a hole in the 
luminous cloud layers of the Sun, 
it might grow tenuous enough to 
be pierced by a vast black moun- 
tain peak on the Sun’s surface. 

T hat it might be the Sun’s 
atmosphere which was lumi- 
nous while the surface was dark 
was not Cassini’s original idea. 
It had been uttered somewhat 
timidly at an earlier date by 
pointing out the highly luminous 
clouds we now call sunset cumu- 
lus and which are so much bright- 
er than the ground. Cassini’s 
authority merely reinforced this 
older idea. 

A century later — ^things did not 
move as fast then as they do now 
— Cassini’s special contribution to 
this theory was removed, but the 
theory itself seemed strengthened 
some more. 

In November 1769, the Sun 
sported an especially large spot 
and Alexander Wilson in Glas- 
gow, who observed it with metic- 
ulous care, realized for the first 
time what virtually everybody 
knows now from photographs.

Such a Sun spot was not just a 
dark blot; it showed some differ- 
entiation in itself. The center 
was really dark, but between this 
dark spot and the surrounding 
bright surface of the Sun was a 
medium -dark area. When such a 
spot had wandered all the way to 
the rim, one could see that per- 
spective made the relative posi- 
tions of the dark center spot and 
the not-so-dark surrounding area 
shift. 

In short, one could see that the 
semi-dark area was lower than the 
surrounding luminous area, while 
the dark center area was still 
lower. 

Obviously, then, there were sev- 
eral layers in the Sun’s atmos- 
phere, one highly luminous top 
layer (but still below that ghostly 
corona one could not normally 
see) and a less luminous lower 
layer. Each layer developed holes 
on occasion and if the holes in 
both layers happened to match, 
we could see the dark “real sur- 
face” of the Sun. 

Although Sir William Herschel 
held to the maxim that “it is 
sometimes of great use in natural 
philosophy to doubt of things 
which are commonly taken for 
granted,” he wholeheartedly ac- 
cepted Wilson’s reasoning. He 
only made a minor correction: 
Wilson had spoken of the “lower 
layer” as less luminous, whereas 
Sir William considered it to be 



dark. We could see it at all only 
because of the fact that it re- 
flected the light of the higher 
luminous layer. 

In the elder Herschel’s opinion, 
the surface of the Sun was pro- 
tected against the heat and glare 
of the top layer by this reflecting 
and absorbing lower layer. To 
bolster the idea that all the lumi- 
nousness might originate only 
from the Sun’s upper atmosphere. 
Sir William pointed out that all 
heavenly bodies, “we have pretty 
good reason to believe, emit light 
in some degree.” The dark side 
of the Moon did so on occasion — 
actually reflected Earthlight 
which is reflected sunlight in the 
first place — the night side of Ven- 
us often glowed (probably au- 
rora) and, in the polar night of 
the Earth there was the glowing 
aurora borealis in the north and 
the equally bright aurora aus- 
tralis in the south. 

TT was a difference in degree 
rather than a fundamental 
difference. “The sun’s similarity,” 
Sir William wrote in 1794, “to 
the other globes of the solar sys- 
tem with regard to its solidity, 
its atmosphere and its diversified 
surface: the rotation upon its 
axis, and the fall of heavy bodies, 
lead us on to suppose that it is 
also most probably inhabited, 
like the rest of the planets, by 
beings whose organs are adapted

to the peculiar circumstances of 
that vast globe.” 

We would be hard put nowa- 
days to invent anything wilder 
than this concept, but it covered 
all the then available information. 
As long as not even the nature 
of chemical combustion was prop- 
erly understood, it made sense. 

To us, it seems like an especial- 
ly striking contrast that Herschel, 
with such a concept in mind, also 
tried to establish whether the 
Sun spots influenced the weather 
on Earth. Having neither astro- 
nomical nor meteorological sta- 
tistics available, he picked the 
only one there was — the recorded 
wholesale prices of grain. Even so, 
he might— ^with luck — have dis- 
covered the Sun-spot cycle, but 
the tool was too inadequate. 

The actual discovery of the 
Sun-spot cycle by Heinrich Sam- 
uel Schwabe did not take place 
until 1843, but around 1770, a 
Danish astronomer had resolute- 
ly entered a remark in his daily 
diary to the effect that “in time, 
a periodicity of the Sun-spot 
phenomenon will be found, since 
every other astronomical phe- 
nomenon shows periodicity.” 

Herschel’s concept of the Sun 
was not disproved by one man 
and one discovery at a specific 
date. It seems to have died very 
gradually, its last remnants being 
swept away by the discovery of 
spectrum analysis in 1859. 



In the meantime, a large num- 
ber of other discoveries had been 
made and some known phenom- 
ena had been thought about. By 
1840, no astronomer doubted any 
more that all the so-called fixed 
stars were suns, too — as had been 
guessed by an Arab eight cen- 
turies earlier — and the phenome- 
non of the Milky Way had been 
explained, by Herschel as a re- 
sult of observation, and by Im- 
manuel Kant independently by 
careful reasoning. One of the dis- 
coveries that became importaant 
was that some stars showed defi- 
nite colors. That some were red 
was obvious, but there ^Iso were 
blue ones. 

So stars could have different 
colors — at that time, it was just 
an item of information to be filed 
away. 

T hen there were the recurrent 
“new stars.” Pliny the Elder 
reported that Hipparchos had 
started his famous star catalogue 
because of such a new star. You 
could not tell whether a star was 
“new” if you did not have a list 
of the “old” ones. 

Two or three other new stars 
had been reported from Roman 
times. Then there had been one 
during the ninth century when 
Arab astronomy was at its peak 
under Caliph al-Mamun. In 1012, 
Hepidanus, a monk of St. Gallen 
in Switzerland, listed another

“new star” in his Chronicle of 
Miracles. One especially famous 
super-nova, to use the modern 
term, occurred in the time of 
Tycho Brahe (1572). Another 
one soon after, in 1604, has often 
been called Kepler’s new star. 
Jean Dominique Cassini got “his” 
in 1670; then there was a pause 
until 1848. 

Of course, there have been quite 
a number since, but the ones 
that influenced thinking in 1840 
were those associated with the 
names of Tycho, Kepler and Cas- 
sini. 

If stars could have different 
colors, wpuld it be possible that 
there were dark stars? When Al- 
exander von Humboldt wrote 
jokingly in a letter about such 
dark celestial ghosts, the then 
famous astronomer Friedrich 
Wilhelm Bessel (the first to 
measure the distance to a star, 
61 Cygni) replied simply: “that 
innumerable stars are visible ob- 
viously does not disprove the ex- 
istence of an equal number of 
invisible stars.” So if there were 
dark stars and also “new” stars, 
wasn’t the simplest explanation 
of the “new” stars that two dark 
stars had collided? Thus the no- 
vas seemed to furnish a round- 
about proof for the existence of 
dark stars. 

Such an event was both end 
and beginning, but the idea of 
“the end” had entered astronom- 



ical thinking, so to speak, by the 
back door. For what were the 
dark stars? 

In 1814, Joseph Fraunhofer, 
discoverer of the lines named aft- 
er him and a/mosf- discoverer of 
spectrum analysis, had compared 
the lines of various stars. He had 
found that his lines were in places 
where the Sun did not show lines 
and had concluded that there 
probably were different kinds of 
stars. 

Fraunhofer’s discovery had 
come clearly too early to be fully 
understood. It took until 1860, 
when Giovanni Batista Donati 
came across Fraunhofer’s state- 
ment in an old volume of the pro- 
ceedings of the Munich Academy 
of Sciences. Donati himself went 
to work on the problem, but most 
of the work was done by Father 
Angelo Secchi, the Papal Astron- 
omer. 

A NGELO Secchi sorted all the 
stars he investigated into 
four classes. Class I were the 
“blue stars” of which Sirius and 
Vega are examples. Class II were 
the “yellow stars” with our own 
sun as the prime example. Class 
III were the “red and orange 
stars,” such as Betelgeuse and 
alpha in Hercules. Class IV, fin- 
ally, was a type of which very 
few and very small stars were 
then known. They were dark red 
and their spectrum was strange. 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Such stars, Father Secchi 
wrote, “which show such zones 
in their spectra must have a lower 
temperature than those which 
show only the fine lines (of Fraun- 
hofer).” In fact, the explanation 
seemed to be that the stars of 
Class I and Class II were far too 
hot to permit the existence of 
chemical compounds, while the 
stars of Class III and especially 
of Class IV were not hot enough 
to prevent their existence. 

We now know that this is 
wrong, but the consequences of 
this careful pioneer work were 
very obvious: Secchi’s four class- 
es were clearly four successive 
stages of a star. Or a sun. At first, 
it began hot, blue-white. In the 
course of time, it cooled to yel- 
low. Then to orange. Then to red. 
In the end, it was too cool to be 
visible at all — ^Bessel’s dark stars. 

So far, eversrthing looked log- 
ical and fine. The stumbling 
block appeared with the logical 
enquiry of how long this develop- 
ment would take. It was the same 
question as “what keeps the Sun 
going?” There were estimates 
of how much heat the Sun pro- 
duced. We know that these esti- 
mates were too small, but they 
appeared enormous. 

John Tyndall (a physicist, not 
an astronomer) said in despair, 
“the facts are so extraordinary 
that the soberest hypothesis must 
appear wild.” The Sun kept ev- 



erything going on Earth, as had 
been well realized by then, but 
the Earth intercepted only a tiny 
fraction of the Sun’s' production 
of heat and light. Any reasonably 
bright high-school boy, knowing 
the diameters of the Sun and the 
Earth and the distance between 
them, could calculate just how 
much radiation the Earth inter- 
cepted. The figure is on the order 
of 1/2,200,000,000. 

A few scientists (but not phy- 
sicists), both astonished and 
somewhat frightened by such fig- 
ures, tried to think a way out. 
Maybe the Sun did not radiate 
into space in all directions. May- 
be radiation between the Sun and 
the planets was a proposition re- 
sembling static electricity — it 
went only in the direction in 
which it was received. 

This was a somehow valiant 
guess, utterly wrong, of course, 
and promptly disbelieved by ev- 
ery expert, even before James 
Clerk Maxwell’s Treatise on 
Electricity and Magnetism in 
1873 furnished the final demolish- 
ing weapon. 

The fact remained that the 
Sun threw enormous amounts of 
energy into space. Where did it 
come from? 

S IR William Thomson, the later 
Lord Kelvin, made a quick 
side calculation. Even if the Sun 
consisted of the best grade of an-

thracite and were furnished with 
the necessary oxygen, it would 
not last more than 5000 years, 
so it could not possibly be chem- 
ical energy. In the first place, it 
obviously wasn’t. In the second 
place, geologists had already 
shown that the Earth was far 
older than 5000 years and that, 
moreover, there had been life on 
Earth for a very much longer 
period. 

But what other energy than 
chemical energy was there? Here 
Hermann von Helmholtz had giv- 
en an answer. The Sun must have 
had a beginning and the only 
possibility one could think of 
was that it had condensed out of 
cosmic dust. It must have been 
large and loose in the past, but 
the mutual gravitational attrac- 
tion of the particles caused this 
body to condense into what we 
now call the Sun. Such contrac- 
tion generates heat. Helmholtz 
advanced the theory, for the first 
time, in 1853, that the Sun kept 
going by continued contraction. 

Calculation showed that a con- 
traction of about 300 feet per 
year should account for the ob- 
served release of energy. And 
since, with contraction, its sur- 
face is diminished, it should ac- 
tually grow hotter. Because the 
contraction would amount to one 
mile every 17 years and the di- 
ameter was 864,000 miles, how- 
eyer, the shrinkage would be too 



small to detect easily. IJ certainly 
could not be detected by compar- 
ing older records with modern 
(1860) observations. 

Extrapolating backward from 
this idea, it turned out that the 
Sun could not be older — as a 
shining star — ^than 18 million 
years at the most. Simon New- 
comb, extrapolating forward at a 
later date, calculated that after 
five million years, the Sun would 
have shrunk to half of its present 
diameter and be eight times as 
dense. After that, the ability to 
contract any more would be dras- 
tically reduced and the tempera- 
ture would have to fall off 
sharply. 

The overall conclusion was that 
the Sun would last another eight 
million years or so. 

The maximum figure of 18 
million years for the past was 
greeted with pleasure at first by 
the geologists, who found in their 
own researches that every new 
discovery they made needed more 
elapsed time. But the geologists 
kept on making discoveries and 
the figure of 18 million years 
soon grew tight for them. 

Well, astronomers and physi- 
cists interested in astronomical 
matters were willing to oblige 
with an alternate idea. Lord Kel- 
vin, who himself estimated the 
age of the Earth as about 100 
million years, was in favor of the 
meteoritic theory, which claimed 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that the Sun maintained its heat 
by the impact heat of the steady 
rain of meteorites that must fall 
into it. 

get a grip on the problem, 
Lord Kelvin calculated how 
the solar furnace would be stoked 
by the impact of the planets it 
now has. If Mercury fell into the 
Sun, it would make up for the 
energy release of about 614 years 
and Venus would account for 
nearly 84 years of energy release. 
The table looked as follows: 



Mercury 


6.6 


years 


Venus 


83.8 




Earth 


95.0 


46 


Mars 


12.6 


44 


Jupiter 


32,254.0 


44 


Saturn 


9,652.0 


44 


Uranus 


1,610.0 


44 


Neptune 


1,890.0 


44 



Total : 45,604.0 years 



From this table, one could cal- 
culate back how much matter 
would have to fall into the Sun 
daily to keep the process contin- 
uous. The result happened to 
produce a nice even figure: If a 
mass equal to l/365th of one per 
cent of the mass of the Earth fell 
into the Sun daily, it would ac- 
count for the energy release. 
Rounded off : one Earth-mass per 
century. This would not show up 
as an increase of the diameter of 
the Sun for a long, long time. 

If the geologists had balked at 
the contraction hypothesis be- 



cause it did not allow them 
enough time in the past, the 
astronomers balked against the 
meteoritic hypothesis because it 
would put too much matter into 
space. 

If the equivalent of one Earth- 
mass fell into the Sun every cen- 
tury, the equivalent of several 
Earth-masses — no, of scores of 
Earth-masses — must be in space 
reasonably near the Sun. 

But the astronomers would see 
them. The Earth itself, for one 
thing, would find a heavy mete- 
oritic bombardment going on all 
the time. The orbits of the inner 
planets would be influenced. It 
might work theoretically, but it 
did not agree with observed facts. 
It was like saying that the ob- 
served level of street noise at a 
busy intersection could be ac- 
counted for by pistols being fired 
at the rate of four rounds per 
second. The noise might be the 
same, but the bullets would cause 
other effects which, however, did 
not show up. 

The majority of astronomers 
thought along a different path. 
The observed energy release of 
the Sun — facts first!— could be 
accounted for by either of these 
two theories. But either should 
have effects which disagreed with 
observation. Therefore, both 
probably worked together. 

A steady hail of meteorites 
stoked the solar furnace, but

there was not enough to replace 
all the lost heat. The difference 
was made up by ccmtraction 
which, under these circumstances, 
could be much slower. Hence the 
geologists got more time in the 
past because of lesser contrac- 
tion, while the observing astron- 
omers were still not asked to 
accept larger amounts of cosmic 
matter than they would willingly 
do. 

A ll this could be made to ac- 
count for continued sunshine. 
But most likely there were elabo- 
rations. One could see the red 
suns in space. They had obvi- 
ously run out of meteoric mate- 
rial and then contracted as far 
as possible, after which they only 
lost heat, with no chance of re- 
plenishing the supply, until their 
temperature had dropped to the 
point where chemical compounds 
became possible. Soon they 
would be completely dark. 

But if they had planets, there 
would be respites, just as sug- 
gested by Lord Kelvin’s calcu- 
lations. The planets, moving 
around their suns, must find 
some slight resistance — infiniteM- 
mal, to be sure, but resistance 
nevertheless. Slowly, their orbits 
would shrink and finally one 
would crash. The sun would be 
rekindled — remember Wells: 
“had for a little time glowed 
more brilliantly again” — and 



then slowly disappear again in 
reddish blackness until the next 
planet crashed. Seen from a long 
distance, this would be one of the 
“new” stars. 

This concept also explained the 
observed fact that these new stars 
did not last long. They suddenly 
flamed into enormous brilliance 
from “nothing,” outshone every- 
thing else for months, but then 
became faint and could not be 
found any more after a few years. 
If they had been collisions be- 
tween two dark star?, they should 
be permanent as far as short- 
lived humans were concerned. 
But a crash of a small planet 
seemed to fit the facts. 

Extending speculation a bit, 
there were two schools of thought. 
Both agreed on the general 
scheme for quite a long way. A 
star formed somehow and, with 
the aid of meteoric material and 
contraction, it kept shining for a 
long time, until the meteoric ma- 
terial was used up and contrac- 
tion, as higher densities were 
reached, became more difficult. 
Near the very end came the bor- 
rowed time of the planet crashes. 

The question was — and here 
the two schools of thought dif- 
fered from each other — ^what was 
likely to happen if you did not 
look at one sun, but at all of 
them together — at the Galaxy, as 
it were? 

One party maintained that the 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



average number of luminous 
stars would remain substantially 
the same because of collisions of 
dark stars and the “original for- 
mation” of new ones. The other 
group maintained that the num- 
ber of luminous stars must de- 
crease steadily, for there was no 
“original material” left to form 
new stars and every pair of dark 
stars that met would make just 
one new, though larger, luminous 
star. 

Therefore, after eons and eons 
of time, all the matter would be 
concentrated into just two super- 
gigantic stars. Alone in space, 
they would, of course, attract 
each other and these two would 
suffer a head-on collision of enor- 
mous masses striking at fantastic 
speed. 

This imimaginable collision 
could not produce a single star. 
It would disperse the matter of 
both! 

But the end of one cycle would 
be the beginning of the next, for 
then there would be again matter 
in space, to condense and form 
completely new stars and planets 
and moons! 



T he picture was complete 
around 1890. 

In 1896, the professor of the 
Ecole Polytechnigue, Antoine 
Henri Becquerel, put uranium 
ores into the same desk drawer in 
which he kept unexposed pho- 
tographic plates, wrapped in 
black paper. Two years later, 
Pierre and Marie Curie isolated 
something they called polonium. 

And in 1910, Dr. Ralph Allen 
Sampson, the Astronomer Royal 
for Scotland, when asked to write 
the article “The Sun” for the 
forthcoming new edition of the 
Encyclopaedia Bzitanraca, only 
expressed the general feeling 
when, after reciting the older 
ideas, he wrote: “a source which 
seems plausible, perhaps only be- 
cause it is less easy to test, is 
rearrangement of the structure of 
the elements’ atoms. An atom is 
no longer figured as indivisi- 
ble . .” 

The no longer indivisible atom 
was to turn most of the older 
ideas upside down once more, as 
we’ll see in next month’s conclu- 
sion of this discussion.

J ONES was beginning to feel 
mildly, p^asantly dizzy. It

basement study at this time of 
night, with the house silent above 
them and the night airs astir. He 
and Wallace had been drinking 
and talking ever since four that 
afternoon, when they’d met at a 
press conference that turned out 
to be a bust. Wallace was a fea- 
ture writer for a chain of British 
papers; he was just beginning a 
two-months’ grand tour of 
America. 

“Quite sinister,” Wallace said. 
“Bear looking into. I should like 
to have your opinion, Jonesy. 
How do you explain it?” 

Jones swallowed, and the cool 
brightness went smoothly down 
to join the warmth at the bot-

“Who?” 

“Robie.” He added, as Wal-

“What’s that to do with V’s?” 
“I don’t know,” Jones said. 
After a while, he got up and sat 
down at the desk with his hands 
resting on the typewriter key- 
board. He twiddled his fingers 
experimentally a few times. “I 
think my fingernail catches on 
the V’ key.” 

Wallace nodded several times. 
“Yes. But why?” 

“Probably stands for some- 
thing Freudian. Women. Woe.

“Wallace, in my case,” said 
Wallace. “Scots wha hae.” 

Jones was slowly warming up 
to the topic. “No, you were right.

he typed rapidly — “I swear I

Wallace grinned. “I see. And

said Jones, “that all typos have

over Jones’s shoulder. “The 
‘w’ happens to be in the middle 
of a nest of high-frequency let- 
ters, doesn’t it? ‘E,’ ‘a,’ ‘s.’ Hold 
on — I’ve got it! Suppose some- 
body were trying to communi- 
cate with you!” 

“They could write me a letter,” 
said Jones. 

“No. No post where he is. 
Cloud-cuckoo land, or Mars, or 
somewhere. You follow me?” 

“Or the spirit world?” asked 
Jones, interested. 

Wallace collapsed into a fit of 



silent laughter and spilled wine 
down the front of Jones’s shirt. 
“Be sensible,” he said happily. 
“Practical. Hard-headed. Some 
psychic little tout in Soho, asleep 
and dreaming of you. Or one of 
your remote descendants, cen- 
turies from now. A by-blow of 
your great-great-grandnephew’s 
brother-in-law’s mistress. Some- 
body reaching back in Time, you 
see, or forward, for that matter. 
Trying to communicate.” 

“What for?” 

“Are you going to be difficult? 
How the deuce do I know what 
for? You haven’t even opened 
the bloody envelope.” 

He sat down again, looking 
miffed. 

“I apologize,” said Jones. 

“Accepted,” said Wallace. He 
sniffed dreamily, tenting his fin- 
gers in front of his long, pale 
face. “Now just suppose — How 
would a fellow like that go about 
getting in touch with you?” He 
held up a hand to forestall Jones’s 
reply. “He’s got a bad cormec- 
tion, you see. He can’t make you 
hear voices, or do automatic writ- 
ing, or ans^thing like that. All he 
can do is twitch your fingers the 
least bit, when they’re already 
moving and you’re not paying 
much attention. Only then. Re- 
sult, typos.” He saluted Jones 
with his glass and drained it. 

“Magnificent,” said Jones. 

“See any flaws in it?” 



DULCIE & DECORUM

“Not a one.” 

“Very well, we shall see. 
Ready?” Staring intently at 
Jones’s manuscript, Wallace read 
off the typographical errors as 
he came to them, and Jones typed 
them out. 

The resulting message read: 

OYKEIOXILERWJWJ. 

“Settles that,” said Wallace 
with relief. “All nonsense, nat- 
urally. Find something else to 
worry about tomorrow. Mean- 
while, landlord, more wine.” 

T he next day was hot and 
sticky, and Jones had a hang- 
over. He sweated on a story that 
had gone infuriatingly wrong 
somewhere and finally gave it 
up. He didn’t tell himself he had 
given it up; he told himself he 
was killing time while his brain 
freshened itself. 

The way he killed time was to 
go back through his manuscript 
and make a long list of typos. It 
was just as good as solitaire' and, 
anyhow, there was a kind of wit- 
less fascination in it. Jones knew 
perfectly well that he was not 
going to find any message hidden 
in his typing errors, any more 
than the lint from his trousers 
cuffs would turn out to be pure 
uranium, but that didn’t stop 
him. Millions of words have been 
written about Shakespeare and 



Bacon for less reason. 

After a while, he had a long 
foolish row of letters, like this: 

EMJBFTDHHTAAGDWWFF4 

CDFZMG 

So he returned to his work, 
which continued to go badly. He 
soon found himself mooning over 
the string of letters again, trying 
to rearrange them and break 
them up so they would make 
sense. Mostly, it seemed to him, 
the trouble was not enough vow- 
els. He tried inserting vowels to 
make words like “job, fit, dough, 
hot,” which was all right in a 
primitive kind of way, but not 
very satisfactory. 

Well, suppose the meaning was 
in the letters he had meant to 
Strike, instead of the ones he had 
actually hit? It was a possible 
hypothesis, no screwier than the 
rest of it, and it gave him an 
excuse to kill more time. So he 
went back painstakingly through 
the manuscript and tracked down 
every typo again, and under each 
he wrote what the letter should 
have been: 

EMJBFTDHHTAAGDW 

JOUGNSRGISQQIVE 

WFF4CDFZMG 

MESESGGDLC 

Using the same system, the 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



best he could do with the sec- 
ond line was “Jurgen’s rig is QQ 
I’ve messes GDLC.” Not much 
help. 

Dividing the letters into clumps 
of four and reading each back- 
ward across the top, forward 
across the bottom, gave him “Me 
Jo, U jug,” followed by gibber- 
ish, and the word “this,” just as 
plain; then drivel again. 

He tried reading the whole se- 
quence backward. Then he tried 
to break it as if it were a simple 
substitution code; but this was 
going too far. Jones gave it up. 

TTE went back to his story and 
actually wrote a paragraph 
before another idea came to him. 

Even if you assumed that 
some typos were market tips 
from the Moon, or hiccups of the 
subconscious, or whatever, you 
had to figure that some typos 
were typos. “W” for “s,” now — 
perfectly natural mistake. But 
“w” for “j,” say — all the way 
across the keyboard — ^would be 
something else again. 

On the typewriter keyboard, 
Jones discovered, “J” was di- 
rectly under “U.” He crossed the 
two letters out. Five more pairs 
went the same way, leaving a 
string of typos which, when you 
came to think of it, were pretty 
odd— like “E” for “J”— different 
fingers, different hand, different 
row of keys. 



He stared at what he had left: 




Something about the bottom 
lines struck his attention. Under 
it, he wrote: 

JONS RISIV MESSG DLC 
JONES RECEIVE MESSAGE 
DLC 

He blinked. “Be taking up 
Yoga next,” he muttered. “Auto- 
matic writing. Old ladies at st- 
ances.” 

But, of course, he was hooked. 
It was that irresolvable “DLC” 
on the end that did it. “DLC” 
what? Doll carts, dull caddy, 
dollars and cents? 

He reached blindly to the shelf 
over his desk, hauled down a 
book, opened it beside his type- 
writer and began transcribing. 
His fingers were nervous. He was 
making a lot of mistakes, he 
knew, but he didn’t try to do any 
better; he just kept banging 
away, eyes fixed on the open 
book, breathing in little agonized 
snorts through his nose. 

He slammed the line-space 
lever and the paper tilted out of 
the machine; he was at the bot- 
tom of the page. He took the 



DULCIE & DECORUM 



71 



paper almost angrily, smoothed 
it out, began listing errors. 

After a few minutes, this is 
what he had: 




JONSOBE OBE OBEI DLC 
JONES OBEY OBEY OBEY 
DLC 

He got drunk all over again, 
sobered up and wrote a letter to 
Wallace in care of the New York 
office. He wrote the letter in 
longhand — ^four pages of it — and 
sent it off before he had a chance 
to lose his nerve. 

J ONES did not touch the type- 
writer again for almost a 
week, in spite of two sharp argu- 
ments with his wife, until the 
letter came from Wallace: 

Hotel Imperial 
Deadwood, Ariz. 

Dear Fred, 

Well, you’re right and I apolo- 
gize for several things that occurred 
to me when I got your letter. 

I am absolutely bowled over, but 
will try to get some first impres- 
sions down. 

Your letter arrived Thursday. 
Friday night, I had just finished a 
piece and I tried your system on 



it, feeling seven kinds of a fool. 
This emerged: Wals (me) cntakt 
derm. (Darkroom?) Not the best 
spelling, but the parallel with your 
message is impossible to ignore, and 
of course there is no way on Earth 
you could have engineered this, so 
I am stuck with the thing. 

Now pay close attention, please. 

1. / have no recollection of pro- 
posing this or any other ttwory of 
typos to you on that evening. I know 
I was well along, but I always re- 
member the next morning. Either 
you’re mistaken or— well, let’s move 
along. 

2. I took the trouble to examine 
t 3 rpescripts by three other newsmen 
I met here; there was nothing in 
them. Has it struck you that even 
if one of us should demonstrate this 
thing, by typing an unfamiliar text 
in the presence of observers, they’d 
be able to say we had memorized 
the message ^forehand and delib- 
erately made the required errors? 

I don’t mean that we couldn’t get 
a hearing— nothing easier with a 
crackpot hypothesis like this, as you 
know— but that we’d convince no- 
body who’d be worth the trouble of 
convincing. 

Later: It comes down to this, 
that we have either got to drop the 
thing now— and do you really see 
yourself doing that, turning out tons 
of copy between now b your 80th 
birthday and wondering all the while 
what grisly mysteries are concealed 
in the typos?— or else we are both 
of us going to wind up listyig to 
starboard, two bonnets with but a 
single bee. If you see any way out 
that I’ve overlooked, speak up.

Still later: Have just been 

through several of my old scripts, 
a thing which has probably occurred 
to you, too, by now. There is noth- 
ipg in them; nothing in anything 
until just last week. I don’t like this. 
I don’t like it in the least 

Why us? 

(In pencil) To save you the trou- 
ble, the typos in this letter spell 
out: Wlas (me again) fil fil be be 
derm. 

I haven’t the slightest idea what 
it may mean, but for some reas<m it 
bothers me more than the other one. 

I keep thinking of that “derm” 
and it reminds me of Chesterton’s 
“The Man Who Was Thursday”— 
do you know it?— that terrifying 
business about the giant who turned 
out to be giving everybody their 
orders, anarchists and policemen 
alike, while sitting in a pitch dark 
room. 

Feet feel be be. I’ve got a head- 
ache. Write when you can. 

Best, 

Walt 

T he following morning, Jones 
went uptown to the offices of 
the news service for which he 
did most of his work. As a free- 
lance feature writer, he should 
have gone to the Reading Room 
of the New York Public Library 
instead, but he had ancient priv- 
ileges and felt more at home in 
the news service’s compact ref- 
erence library. 

He looked in the Unabridged 
first, then in the Dictionary of 
Abbreviations. 

DULCIE a DECORUM 



He found no D. L. C. and no 
D. C. R. M. 

D. L. S. was Doctor of Library 
Science. Jones snorted. Or if you 
inverted it, D. C. L. was Doctor 
of Civil Law. There was a 
C. R. O. M., meaning Coidedera- 
ci6 Regional Obrera Mexicaita; 
you could put a D. on the front 
to stand for Director . 

What if they were phonetic 
spellings, though? Everything 
else in the “messages” was 
DLC and DCRM. Dulcie and — 
uh — Decorum. Dulcie and Decor- 
um! He felt a quickening of in- 
terest. That meant something, if 
only — 

Phil Mann shuffied into the 
room and stood quietly watching 
him, comfortably paunchy in a 
knit sports shirt, pipe in his hand. 
Jones looked up. 

“Find it?” 

“No,” said Jones abstractedly. 
Now what the devil was it that 
he’d been on the verge of? 

Mann glanced at the diction- 
ary on the table. “If it’s abbrevi- 
ations you want, that guy out 
there is your man.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Sure. I think you met him 
once. Sam Fowler. Does cross- 
word puzzles for the Trib. Any 
cockeyed combinations of letters, 
he knows.” 

Fowler was pudgy and fat- 
lipped; his eyes were enormous 
behind swimmy lenses. He gazed 

73 



at the ceiling, stroking his chin. 
“D. L. C.,” he said. “Doctor of 
Literary — Doctor of Library — 
Nup. D. C. R. M. Hmm . .” 
He shook his head. 

“I didn’t think so,” said Jones. 
“It was just a — ” 

“Wait a minute, wait a min- 
ute.” 

Fowler shook a fat palm at 
him and went on staring at the 
ceiling. He shifted on the edge of 
the desk, moved his lips once or 
twice, sniffed, and went on star- 
ing. 

Mann wandered over to look 
at one of the softly clicking tele- 
type machines and wandered 
back again. 

At last Fowler said, “Only 
thing I can think of — don’t know 
whether it’ll help you — ” 

“Yes?” Jones encouraged. 

“Computer names. Not any 
that I ever heard of, but they’re 
making new ones all the time. 
Digital Linear Computer. Digi- 
tal Computer — ah — Recompen- 
saeing, Military. Something like 
that. Not those, of course. Com- 
puter names.” 

Jones was heading for the door 
when Fowler called after him. 

“Uh?” he asked, turning. 

“Any periods?” Fowler re- 
peated. 

“Any — ? Oh. No periods. Just 
DLC, DCRM.” 

“Computer names,” said Fow- 
ler dogmatically. 



A T home, mechanically tran- 
scribing from the open boo^ 
on his left, Jones slowly realized 
that it didn’t have to be com- 
puter names, for Pete’s sake, at 
all. How about government de- 
partments ? Department of Labor 
Controls? If you were going to 
imagine things, why not Depart- 
ment of Control and Regulation 
of Management? 

Funny that hadn’t occurred to 
him at the time. Or to Fowler. 
Jones felt a bit irritated; the man 
ought to know his own business 
better than that. And yet the idea 
of the computers had taken in- 
stant hold of his imagination. 
DLC and DCRM, two giant 
blocks of masonry, dull-lit, full 
of the smells of ozone and oiled 
metal, and the sound of purr- 
ing .. 

He came to the end of a page 
and ripped it out of the machine. 
It was getting so that he hated 
to touch the typewriter; the keys 
were like little metal teeth that 
snapped back at him. Not enough 
sleep last night or the night be- 
fore. He was on edge. 

He forced himself to think 
about the government depart- 
ments again while he tabulated 
errors. There was something so 
solid and safe about a govern- 
ment department. Department of 
Control and Regulation — 

His fingers had gone numb. He 
stared down at his writing.

Idling up there in the big ma-

“Dulcie!” cried Jones, stran- 
gling. “Dulce — uh! Dulcie!” 

Little steel typewriter keys 
were stuck in his shoulder. He 
writhed. 

“Wake up! Fred!” 

He stared at his wife’s face 
foggily. She was all blurry in the 
funny light from the bedstand. 

“Dulcie,” he said with a thick 
tongue. 

She let go his shoulder and 
brushed a cable of hair back 
from her forehead. “Fred, what’s 
the matter with you? You scared 
me.” 

He moved his lips and tongue 
experimentally. “All right,” he 
mumbled. 

“You’re not awake yet,” she 
said, studying him. “Who’s Dul- 
cie?” 

“Just a nightmare.” He shud- 
dered. “Just another damned 
nightmare.” 

He threw the bedcovers back 
and started to get out of bed. 



It^YRA watched him in silence 
until he began putting on 
his clothes. “Where are you go- 
ing? Do you know what time it 
is?” 

“Half past three,” said Jones, 
glancing at the clock. ‘Doesn’t 
matter. Wide awake.” 

“Fred, sit down a minute. I 
want to talk to you.” 

Jones kept going out of the 
bedroom. 

“Fred, I’ve taken about as 
much of this — ” 

“Not now!” he shouted. 

He went on down to his study, 
clicked on the friendly lights and 
sat down by the window. He lit 
a cigarette. The fluorescent light 
on his desk began to hum. 

“Stop that, damn you!” Jones 
yelled, and sprang at it. It top- 
pled over, tinkled, sputtered ma- 
liciously, and went out. 

Jones got the oilcloth cover 
from behind the filing cabinet, 
where he had tossed it years ago, 
and carefully draped it over the 
typewriter, not touching the 
metal with his Angers. 

“Click,” he said between his 
teeth, pulling the edges of the 
cover tight. “Go ahead and 
click.” 

After a moment, hesitantly, he 
picked up the telephone. He used 
a yellow pencil to dial 211. 

“Long distance,” said the whis- 
kery voice in his ear. 

“I want to make a call to 



DULCIE & DECORUM 



75 



Deadwood, Arizona. Station to 
station. The Imperial Hotel.” 
Jones introduced himself to 
the thin voice at the other end of 
the line. “I’m trying to locate 
Mr. Walter Wallace. Did he 
leave a forwarding address or 
mention where he was going when 
he checked out?” 

“Just one moment, sir . No, 
sir, Mr. Wallace hasn’t checked 
out. He’s still in the hotel.” 
“Ring him,” said Jones. “No, 
wait a minute. Take a message. 
Tell him I’m grabbing the first 
plane out.” 

Wallace was waiting for him in 
his room. He was paler than ever. 
He seemed to listen to himself 
with a faint, incurious surprise. 

“I was due to go on to Reno 
day before yesterday, but I did- 
n’t. No point to it until I get this 
thing settled. Awfully good of 
you to come out and compare 
notes.” 

The roar of the plane’s engines 
was still faintly in Jones’s ears, 
like a far-off, thimderous, metal 
surf. He heard himself ask, “Do 
you have nightmares?” 

“Nightmares!” said Wallace 
faintly, with a wry twist of his 
lips. “Oh, yes. Any amount. I 
haven’t touched a typewriter.” 
“Me, either.” 

“Now you’d think that would 
help, but it doesn’t.” Wallace 
laced his long, translucent fin- 
gers together, hunching himself 



like a large, pale spider in the 
maple chair, in the chintz-fil- 
tered sunlight. “Has it struck 
you,” he asked slowly, “that none 
of the messages actually said any- 
thing? Told us anjrthing? Con- 
tact. Receive message. Obey. 
Would you take the trouble to 
reach back two hundred years in 
time to say that to anybody?” 

J ONES heard his own breath 
whistling in his nose. “Why 
did you say two himdred years?” 
“Oh, well,” said Wallace, and 
looked away with a little smirk. 
“I have been sitting here think- 
ing,” he went on, “and do you 
know what else I’ve thought of? 
. I’m not boring you? Can’t 
imderstand why not . I’m 
thinking of thrillers I read in my 
carefree youth, where the. mur- 
derer would send you a note with 
some insidious Oriental poison on 
it. You see, it didn’t matter what 
the note said. It could be any- 
thing. For example, ‘What price 
umbrellas now?’ You opened it 
up, and got the poison on your 
fingers, and then you were as 
good as dead. That was the real 
message.” 

“Listen,” Jones asked after a 
moment, “what does it want? 
Can you feel that? Do you — ” 
“Want?” said Wallace. “Want? 
I don’t know. We’re finding out, 
though, aren’t we? We opened the 
bloody envelope. Now they don’t

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



need to muck about with typo- 
graphical errors, you see. We’re 
on the hook.” He smiled. “What 
do you suppose the worm says 
to the fish?” 

Jones sat dully in his rumpled 
topcoat with his hat on his knee. 
He was unshaven and his shirt 
was buttoned up wrong. He got 
a cigarette out of his pocket, 
looked at it and put it away. 

“I do run on,” said Wallace 
politely. 

Looking at him, Jones discov- 
ered that Wallace was aston- 
ishingly flat. He was a nicely 
colored picture pasted up in the 
air in front of a flat chintzy wall, 
with light coming through from 
somewhere Outside . like the 
peephole boxes they had made 
in Sunday school when he was a 
kid, pasting up cut-out people 
and furniture from magazines, to 
stand there in a stifling shoe-box 
and be stared at. 

It was a curious feeling. He 
knew that he could get up and 
step across the carpet and touch 
Wallace, and find him round and 
solid and breathing. But he knew 
it wouldn’t mean ansrthing; he 
could do it, yet it wouldn’t be 
any sort of proof. 

And looking at the flat illusion 
that was Wallace, he could see 
that Wallace felt the same about 
him. 

He stood up. “We’ll have to 
work together,” he said. “Lick 

DULCIE & DECORUM 



this thing. Must leave now.” 
“Oh, yes,” Wallace agreed. 
“Awfully nice of you to call.” 

M yra said, “I just can’t get 
used to it.” She was sitting 
on the dim side of the room, 
hands in her lap, looking at the 
carpet. Near her. Milt Kalish sat 
uncomfortably, wishing for more 
light and holding an unlit cigar 
in his hand. 

From the next room came the 
intermittent sound of hammer- 
ing. 

“We don’t know yet, Myra,” 
said Kalish- 

“Can’t you tell7” she asked, 
with a bitter undertone. “I know. 
He’s going to have to go to a 
sanitarium, or a rest home or 
whatever name you want to call 
it. He probably won’t come back. 
I knew it and I could see it on 
your face, even before dinner. So 
why won’t you admit it?” 

Kalish sighed. “Maybe it isn’t 
that simple.” 

“Simple!” she said. 

Kalish did not move; his mind 
registered the implied resent- 
ment, classified it and filed it 
away. He said nothing and did 
not move, and his hostility to- 
ward the world of people stayed 
buried so deeply that Myra could 
only sense that it must be there, 
not feel it or use it. 

The hammering started again 
and Kalish saw Myra’s hands 

77 



clench. Then it stopped and there 
were footsteps in the kitchen. 

Myra looked straight ahead. 

Jones came into the room, 
stooping a little, his spectacle 
rims catching the light. He had 
a tack hammer in his hand. He 
went to the secretary, opened the 
top drawer and scrabbled up a 
handful of pencils. 

“Fred,” said Kalish, “have you 
got time to sit down and talk to 
me a little?” 



“Shudas paparalishus," replied 
Jones. He turned around and 
went out. 

Myra’s voice was thin with 
strain. “What was that? More 
Russian?” 

“No.” 

“What then?” 

Kalish shrugged his shoulders 
and twisted his neck slightly. It 
helped the little tickle of pain 
between his shoulder-blades, but 
it wasn’t a gesture he permitted 




78

himself during office hours. “Lith- 
uanian, perhaps. I didn’t recog- 
nize it. I’m not really a linguist; 
I just pick up a few words here 
and there from my patients.” 
“What was that he kept say- 
ing all during dinner? That was 
Russian.” 

Kalish blinked. “Yes. Pogebe!e 
— ruin, devastation.” 

“Why Russian? That’s all I 
want to know. We never had any 
trouble — I think I could stand 
it, but it’s that one extra thing 
on top of everything else.” She 
began to cry. “Russian!” 

“YoU don’t know where he 
might have picked it up?” 

“No.” She added bitterly, 
“Two nights ago — when I told 
you about, when I thought he 
was coming out of it — I asked 
him. And he said it was be- 
cause his great-great-great-I-for- 
get-how-many-times grandson 
was a Russian. Then I knew he 
was crazy.” 

J ONES was building a maze. 

He had started with little rec- 
tangular strips of wood from an 
orange crate, all different sizes, 
and when the crate gave out he 
had begun using strips of tin, held 
together at the corners by all- 
purpose cement and lead pencils. 

“Maze” was the nearest word. 
It was a little like a model for 
a mad architect’s building, skel- 
etons of rooms piled one on an- 



DULCIE & DECORUM 



79 



other, first the wood from the 
orange crate; then tin, all at dif- 
ferent levels, all open at the ends, 
so that you could look all the 
way through it. He did not know 
what he wanted it for. 

Myra and some man were 
standing behind him, watching. 

They didn’t bother Jones. In 
one ear and out the other. Now a 
top piece here and then we start 
a new cell . 

He reached for the tin and 
found only a snippet, not big 
enough for anything. There had 
been a bigger piece on the bench, 
he remembered, but no matter. 
He wandered down the bench, 
looking at things. There was a 
scrap of linoleum — 

Somebody’s arm in a blue pin- 
stripe sleeve appeared just as he 
reached for it and took the lino- 
leum away. 

What else? Jones started mu- 
singly across the garage work- 
shop, thinking and looking. 
Kerosene can — big one, empty, 
standing in the comer. He could 
cut that up with the tin snips, 
probably. But just as he got to 
it, the same blue pinstripe arm 
came and took it away. 

Jones looked around in mild 
annoyance. The pinstripe man 
was standing there, with the can 
in one hand and the piece of tin 
in the other. Myra stood right 
beside him. 

He reached for the tin; that 



would be better than fooling 
around cutting up a kerosene can. 
The blue pinstripe held it away 
from him. 

“Fred, do you remember me? 
Milt Kalish? We used to live next 
door in Long Branch. Remem- 
ber?’’ 

“Kalish,” he said agreeably, 
and reached for the tin again. 

Pinstripe held it away from 
him. “Not quite yet, Fred. First 
tell me what you’re building here. 
Can you tell me now? Do you 
want to tell me what you’re 
building here?” 

“A thing,” explained Jones. He 
made descriptive motions with 
his hands. “You know.” 

M yra put a handkerchief 
over her mouth and went 
away. 

Jones reached for the tin. 

“Not yet, Fred. Tell me, who 
is Dulcie?” 

Dulcie ... A pulsating hum. 
A close warmth. A darkness. He 
could feel her aroimd him, es- 
pecially when he closed his eyes, 
but she was a long way away. It 
was hard for her to talk to him, 
hard for him to listen. 

“Is she a person?” 

Ridiculous idea . He grinned, 
shook his head. 

“Is Dulcie female?” 

Well, yes. You would have to 
say so, he supposed. 

He nodded. 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The voice kept on. Had Dulcie 
told him to make the thing, what 
was it for, did he see her, hear 
her? “Does she talk to anybody 
else besides you?” 

“Not yet,” Jones said. And 
that was enough. He turned 
around and went back to his 
bench, in case the piece of tin 
should be there, after all, and it 
was. He cut rectangles of tin with 
the snips, carefully, and began 
to build a new cell that would 
finish the fourth tier. 

Their voices trickled through 
his head. “I think we’ll leave him 
alone now for a few minutes. You 
said there were some papers?” 
“Downstairs. In his study.” 
Pinstripe was gone, which 
meant Jones could go on with 
his work. 

He began cutting linoleum into 
neat strips. Linoleum would do 
fine. 

“Fred — ” she began weepily. 
He was cementing the first wall 
of a new cell that had nothing to 
lean against. That was the hard- 
est part, making the first wall 
solid and straight. People didn’t 
know. 

“Fred, can’t you talk to me?” 
The linoleum was working 
very well. He had no way of be- 
ing sure, but he had a feeling he 
was almost through. 

A Myra hand came and yanked 
away the rest of the linoleum. 
Jones noticed the heavy paper 



of the calendar on the wall and 
pulled it down. He cut a few 
strips of it experimentally. 

It worked fine. 

T he maze was finished. Jones 
knew what it was for. 

The reason it looked weird to 
other people was that it remind- 
ed them of a building. And of 
course, if you tried to make a 
building out of it, it was all 
wrong. 

It was a model of something 
else altogether : a model of a way 
of thinking. It was, you might 
say, a constant reminder. In and 
around and down. In and around 
and down. Jones tilted the thing 
gently to see better. In and 
around and. In and around. In 
and. In. 

It was like looking at one of 
those hypnotic spiral disks, but 
with a difference. Looking at a 
spiral only stunned your fore- 
brain, opened up your skull to 
let any suggestion in. But look- 
ing into the maze forced your 
mind into a definite pattern, over 
and over — like tuning a radio re- 
ceiver to one station, or like mak- 
ing a lock that would fit only one 
key. 

Jones’s mind was perfectly 
clear. He knew the maze was to 
make him hear Dulcie better. And 
he heard her. 

When he shut his eyes, the 
world blackened and slipped

back out of sight like blown ash, 
Myra and Kalish and workshop 
and all. He felt the centuries 
wavering past him until he hung 
disembodied in tomorrow’s twi- 
light — 

A cool dim place. Tip. Mind 
your hats goan in. A silence that 
trembled in the walls. 

This was Dulcie. As he hung 
there, loving her, her knowledge 
flowed through him. 

He remembered how it all 
began: 

“Of course it isn’t a substitute 
for the General Staff or anything 
like that. Human minds still 
have to make the decisions. But 
modem warfare involves so many 
factors that it really has become 
a mathematical problem. And to 



solve a mathematical problem 
faster, more efficiently, we use an 
electronic calculator — DLC. We 
know, incidentally, that the other 
side has been doing the same for 
the last three years.” 

After that, at first, Dulcie 
munched the little problems they 
gave her and ticked out the an- 
swers. But it happened that a 
human evaluation lost a battle 
and they set up the channels to 
feed information directly into 
Dulcie. And a human decision 
lost another battle and, not with- 
out fierce argument among them- 
selves, they gave her the channels 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of command. They had no real 
choice, except to wait until the 
other side did it to their com- 
puter first. 

So Dulcie became a chess 
player. Her board was the planet, 
her pieces men and machines. 

P to QB4: and down rained a 
hell of missiles that pretended 



economy became her passion. 
She reduced the elements of war- 
fare to a basic few, and reduced 
them again. 

Across the ocean, deep in an- 
other continent, so did her en- 
emy. 

Now war to a computer is not 
the same as war to a human be- 
ing. Nobody had ever thought it 
was, or so much as tried to make 
Dulcie feel that human revulsion 
from the things they so enthusi- 
astically did. 

Dulcie did two things that no 
one had expected. 



the rooftops were not there, nor 
the people under them, nor the 
ships in the harbor, nor the boys 
playing ball outside the town. 

D ulcie was a living thing. It 
was in her to grow and in- 
crease her ability, to do her job 
with greater thoroughness, effi- 
ciency, simplicity, elegance. 

Like an old gray philosopher, 
or boxer, or politician, she 
learned to do much with little; 



DULCIE ft DECORUM 



83 




Probing into the mysteries of 
the human brain, so convenient 
and puzzling a model of her own, 
she found the pattern that could 
fix a mind forever in one unrea- 
soning conviction. She chose the 
simplest and best for her pur- 
pose: I love Dulcie. She insinu- 
ated that pattern into the mind 
of every man, woman and child 
within her reach — ^within her 
hemisphere — and canceled out all 
the problems of discipline, train- 
ing, tradition, politics, civil gov- 
ernment, military organization, 
law enforcement — seven-tenths, 
let’s say, of the human picture 
— at one stroke. 

The second thing was even 
simpler. She deduced the exist- 
ence of her opponent, searched 
for him on wavelengths which 
should be as perceptible to him 
as to her, and worked out a sys- 
tem of communication. 

It was not necessary for men 
or machines to go to war. DLC 
could say to DCRM, “I move 
such a force here.” DCRM could 
reply, “Then I move here.” 

Not every game had to be 
played out. When Dulcie lost, 
she paid. Machines could be de- 
stroyed more efficiently by their 
owner than by the enemy; hu- 
man beings, asked to die, did it 
tidily and conveniently. There 
was no cruelty or humor in it for 
Dulcie; it simply made her books 
balance. 



And when, in spite of her best 
fumbling efforts, her human be- 
ings — ^her counters — diminished 
until aone were left, what was 
she to do but search in the vast- 
ness of time for more? She began 
tentatively, feeling back along 
the ancestral lines of the last to 
die, touching here an ancestor 
more susceptible than the rest, 
here another — 

ONES mumbled something. 
“What was that?” Myra asked 
Kalish. “Did you get it?” 

Kalish was carrying some 
typed papers; the inked notes at 
the bottom of them, in his own 
handwriting, were not quite dry. 
His face had a peculiar expres- 
sion, a little like that of a man 
who thinks he has just been 
wounded, but hasn’t felt the 
pain. 

“Latin this time,” he said. 
“Du/ce et decorum est pro patria 
mori. ‘It is sweet and fitting to 
die for one’s country.’ ” 

The link strained tight. Jones 
felt his love gathering inside him 
like a fist: suffocating love, burst- 
ing love. He knew it all now. He 
knew what Dulcie wanted him 
for and the joy of being chosen 
was more than he could bear. 

His heart burst with it. 

“Click,” said Dulcie. 

“Click,” answered Decorum. 

And Jones did.

Hal from the Lydna Project and

By MIRIAM ALLEN deFORD 

Illustrated by Irv DOCKTOR 



W E had the driver let us 
off in the central dis- 
trict and took a copter- 
taxi back to Homefield. There’s 
no disgrace about it, of course; 
we just didn’t feel like having all 
the neighbors see the big skycar 
with Lydna Project painted on 
its side, and then having them 
drop in casually to express what 
they would call interest and we 
would know to be curiosity. 

There are people who boast 
that their sons and daughters 
have been picked for Lydna. 
What is there to boast about? 
It’s pure chance, within limits. 

And Hal is our only child and 
we love him. 

Lucy didn’t say a word all the 
way back from saying good-by 



to him. Lucy and I have been 
married now for 27 years and I 
guess I know her about as well 
as anybody on Earth does. People 
who don’t know her so well think 
she’s cold. But I knew what feel- 
ings she was crushing down in- 
side her. 

Besides, I wasn’t feeling much 
like talking myself. I was remem- 
bering too many things: 

Hal at about two, looking up 
at me — ^when I would come home 
dead -tired from a hard day of 
being chewed at by half a dozen 
bosses right up to the editor-in- 
chief whenever anjrthing went the 
least bit out of kilter — ^with a 
smile that made all my tiredness 
disappear. Hal, when I’d pick 
him up at school, proudly dis-

playing a Cybernetics Approval 
Slip (and ignoring the fact that 
half the other kids had one, too). 
Hal the day I took him to the 
Beard Removal Center, certain 
that he was a man, now that he 
was old enough for depilation. 
Hal that morning two weeks ago, 
setting out to get his Vocational 
Assignment Certificate . 

That’s when I stopped remem- 
bering. 

It had been five years after 
our marriage before they let us 
start a child : some question about 
Lucy’s uncle and my grand- 
mother. Most parents aren’t as 
old as we are when they get the 
news and usually have other chil- 
dren left, so it isn’t so bad. 

W HEN we got home, Lucy 
still was silent. She took 
off her scarf and cloak and put 
them away, and then she pushed 
the button for dinner without 
even asking me what I wanted. 
I noticed, though, that she was 
ordering all the things I like. 
We both had the day off, of 
course, to go and say good-by to 
Hal — Lucy is a technician at 
Hydroponics Center. 

I felt awkward and clumsy. 
Her ways are so different from 
mine; I explode and then it’s over 
— ^just a sore place where it hurts 
if I touch it. Lucy never explodes, 
but I knew the sore place would 
be there forever, and getting 



worse instead of better. 

We ate dinner in silence, though 
neither of us felt hungry, and 
had the table cleared. Then it 
was nearly 19 o’clock and I had 
to speak. 

“The takeoff will be at 19:10,” 
I said. “Want me to tune in now? 
Last year, when Mutro was Solar 
President, he gave a good speech 
before the kids left.” 

“Don’t turn it on at all!” she 
said sharply. Then, in a softer 
voice, she added: “Of course, 
Frank, turn it on whenever you 
like. I’ll just go to my room and 
open the soundproofing.” 

There were still no tears in her 
eyes. 

I thought of a thousand things 
to say: Don’t you want to catch 
a glimpse of Hal in the' crowd 
going up the ramp? Mightn’t 
they let the kids wave a last fare- 
well to their folks listening and 
watching in? Mightn’t something 
in the President’s speech make us 
feel a little better? 

But I heard myself saying, 
“Never mind, Lucy. Don’t go. 
I’ll leave the thing off.” 

I didn’t want to be alone. I 
wanted Lucy there with me. 

So we sat out the whole time 
of the visicast, side by side on 
the window-couch, holding 
hands. I’ll say this for the neigh- 
bors — ^they must all have known, 
for Hal was the first to be select- 
ed from Homefield in nearly 40

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



years, and the newscast must 
have announced it over and over! 
but not a single person on the 
whole 62 floors of the house but- 
ted in on us. Not even that snoopy 
student from Venus in 47-14, 
who’s always dropping in on other 
tenants and taking notes on “the 
mores of Earth Aboriginals.” 
People can be very decent some- 
times. We needn’t have worried 
about coming home in the Lydna 
Project bus. 

It was no good trying to keep 
my mind on anjrthing else. 
Whether I wanted to or not, I 
had to relive the two last hours 
we’d ever have with Hal. 

It couldn’t mean to him what 
it meant to us. We were losing; 
he was both losing and gaining. 
We were losing our whole lives 
for 21 years past; he was, too, but 
he was entering a new life we 
would never know anything 
about. No word ever comes from 
Lydna; that’s part of the project. 
Nobody even knows where it is for 
sure, though it’s supposed to be 
one of the outer asteroids. 

Both boys and girls are sent 
and there must be marriages and 
children — though probably the 
death-rate is pretty high, for 
every year they have to select 
200 more from Earth to keep the 
population balanced. We would 
never know if our son married 
there, or whom, or when he died. 
We would never see our grand- 



children, or even know if we had 
any. 

T¥AL was a good son and I 
think we were fairly good par- 
ents and had made his childhood, 
happy. But at 21, faced with a 
great, mysterious adventure and 
an unknown and exciting future, 
a boy can’t be expected to be 
drowned in grief at saying good- 
by to his humdrum old father and 
mother. It might have been 
tougher for him 200 years ago, 
when they hadn’t learned to de- 
condition children early from 
parental fixations. But no yoimg- 
ster today would possess that 
kind of unwholesome depend- 
ency. If he did, he would never 
have been selected for Lydna in 
the first place. 

That’s one comfort we have — 
it’s a sort of proof we had reared 
a child far above the average. 

It was just weakness in me to 
half wish that Hal hadn’t been 
so healthy, so handsome, so in- 
telligent, so fine in character. 

They were a wonderful lot. We 
said our good-bys in an enormous 
room of the spaceport, with this 
year’s 200 selectees there from all 
over Earth, each with the rela- 
tives and whoever else had per- 
mission to make the last visit. 
I suppose it’s a matter of ac- 
commodations and transporta- 
tion, for nobody’s allowed more 
than three. So it was mostly

parents, with a few brothers, sis- 
ters and sweethearts or friends. 
The selectees themselves choose 
the names. After all, they’ve had 
two weeks after they were noti- 
fied to say good-by to everyone 
else who matters to them. 

Most of the time, all I could 
keep my mind on was Hal, try- 
ing to fix forever in my memory 
every last detail of him. We have 
dozens of sound stereos, of course, 
but this was the last time. 

Still, it’s my business at the 
News Office, and has been for 30 
years, to observe people and 
form conclusions about them, so 
I couldn’t help noticing with a 
professional eye some of the rest 
of the selectees. (This farewell 
visit is a private affair, and the 
press is barred, which is why I’d 
never been there before.) 

There were two kinds of se- 
lectees that stood out, in my mind. 
One was those who had nobody 
at all to see them off. Completely 
alone, poor kids — orphans, doubt- 
less, with no families and appar- 
ently not even friends near enough 
to matter. But, in a way, they 
would be the happiest; life on 
Earth couldn’t have been very re- 
warding for them, and on Lydna 
they might find companionship. 
(If only companionship in misery, 
I thought — ^but I shied away from 
that. In our business, there are 
always leaks; we know — or guess 
— a few things about Lydna no- 



body else does, outside the au- 
thorities themselves. But we keep 
our mouths shut.) 

The ones that tore my hearts 
were the boys and girls in love. 
They never take married people 
for Lydna, but a machine can’t 
tell what a boy or girl is feeling 
about another girl or boy, and 
it’s a machine that does the se- 
lecting. There’s no use putting 
up an argument, for, once made, 
the choice is inexorable and un- 
changeable. In my work as a 
newsgatherer. I’ve heard some 
terrible stories. There have been 
suicide pacts and murders. 

VT’OU could tell the couples in 
love. Not that there were any 
scenes. If there had been any 
in the two weeks past, they were 
over. But anybody who has learn- 
ed to read human reactions, as 
I have, could recognize the agony 
those youngsters were going 
through. 

I felt a deep gratitude that 
Hal wasn’t one of them. He’d 
had his share of adolescent af- 
fairs, of course, but I was sure 
he was still just playing around. 
He’d seen a lot of Bet Milen, a 
girl a class ahead of him in school 
and college, but I didn’t think 
she meant more to him than any 
of the others. If she had, she’d 
have been along to say good-by, 
but he’d asked for only the two 
of us. She was now a laboratory

assistant in our hospital and 
could easily have gotten the time 
off. 

It was growing late, almost 
midnight, and Lucy and I had to 
be at work tomorrow, no matter 
how we felt. I forced myself to 
talk, with Lucy’s silent pain 
smothering me like a force-blank- 
et. I made an effort and cleared 
my throat. 

“Lucy, go to bed and turn on 
the hypno and try to get some 
sleep.” 

Lucy stood up obediently, but 
she shook her head. “You go, 
dear,” she said, her voice firm. 
“I can’t. I—” 

The roof buzzer sounded. 
Somebody had landed in a cop- 
ter and wanted us. 

“Don’t answer,” I said quickly. 
“There’s nobody we want to 
see — 

But she had already pushed 
the button to open the door. 

It was Bet Milen, the girl Hal 
used to go around with.. 

I braced myself. This might 
be bad. She might have cared 
more for Hal than we had guess- 
ed. 

But she didn’t look grief - 
stricken. She looked excited, and 
determined, and a little bit fright- 
ened. 

She scarcely glanced at me. 
She went right up to Lucy and 
took both Lucy’s hands in hers. 

“Well,” she said in a clipped. 



tense voice, “we made it.” 

Then Lucy broke for the first 
time. The tears ran down her face 
and she didn’t even wipe them 
away. “Are you certain?” 

“Positive. And I got word to 
him. We’d agreed on a code. 
That’s why he didn’t want me 
there today — we couldn’t trust 
ourselves not to betray it, either 
way.” 

I stood there staring at them, 
bewildered. 

“What’s this all about?” I de- 
manded. “Have you two cooked 
up some crazy scheme to rescue 
Hal? I hope to heaven not! It 
would ruin all of us, including 
him!” 

^^HE wild daydreams I’d had 
-*■ myself hashed through my 
mind — the drug that would seem 
to kill him and wouldn’t, the 
anonymous false accusation of 
subversion, the previous secret 
marriage. All impossible, all fatal. 

Lucy disengaged her hands 
from the girl’s and slipped her 
arm through mine. 

“You tell him. Bet,” she said 
gently. “You’re the one who 
should.” 

I’d never noticed how pretty 
the girl was till then, when she 
stood there with her face flushed 
and her eyes straight on mine. 
A pang went through me; if only 
she and Hal could have — 

“No, Mr. Sturt,” she said, “we 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



haven’t rescued Hal. He’s gone. 
But we’ve rescued part of him. 
I’m going to have his baby.” 

“Bet’s going to live with us 
and be our daughter, Frank,” 
Lucy explained. “Hal and she 
and I worked it out in these two 
weeks, after they came to me and 
told me how they felt about each 
other. We couldn’t tell you till we 
were sure; I couldn’t bear to have 
you hope and then be disap- 
pointed — it would be enough for 
me to have to suffer that.” 

“That is. I’ll come if you want 
me here, Mr. Sturt,” said Bet. 

I had to sit down before I 
could speak. “Of course I want 
you. But what about your own 
family?” 

“I haven’t any. My mother’s 
dead and my father’s an engineer 
on Ganymede and gets home on 
leave about once in three years. 
I’ve been living in a youth hos- 
tel.” 

“But look here — ” I turned to 
Lucy — “how on Earth can you 
know? Two weeks or less is no 
time—” 

Lucy gave me a look I recog- 
nized, the patient one of the sci- 
entist for the layman. 

“The Chow-Visalius test, dear. 
One day after the fertilized ovum 
starts dividing — ” 

“And I ran it myself every day 
for over a week. That’s one of 
my jobs in the lab and it was easy 
to slip in another specimen. And 



it didn’t, and it didn’t and I went 
nearly out of my mind — ” 

“Every time Hal entered the 
apartment. I’d look at him and 
he’d shake his head,” Lucy inter- 
rupted. “It meant ever}^hing to 
him. And it would just have 
broken my heart — ” 

“Mine, too,” Bet said softly. 
“And his. And today was the last 
chance. I was scared to try it. 
This afternoon at 14:30, just be- 
fore the farewell visits, was the 
deadline for viz messages to any 
of them. If I’d had to send mine 
without the word we’d agreed on 
that would tell him it was all 
right — But it was, at last! And 
now he knows, even if I never — 
even if we never — Excuse me, 
please, it’s been a strain. I’m 
afraid I’m going to bawl.” 

W E let her alone. Kids nowa- 
days hate to be fussed over. 
Us, we’d lost our son, and that 
was going to stay with us forever. 
But now we would have his child 
to love and — 

An appalling thought struck 
me suddenly. I can’t imagine why 
I hadn’t realized it sooner. All 
this emotion, I suppose. 

“Good God!” I cried. “An il- 
legal child! We can’t keep it!” 
“Nobody’s going to know,” 
Lucy replied calmly. “Bet’s going 
to live with us, and when it starts 
to show, she’s going to take her 
allowed leave. We’ll take ours.

too, and we’ll all go on a trip— 
to Mars, maybe, or Venus— one 
of the settled colonies where we 
can rent a house. Babies don’t 
have to be bom in hospitals, you 
know; our ancestors had them 
right at home. She’s strong and 
healthy and I know what to do. 
Then we’ll come back here and 
we’ll have a baby with us that we 
adopted wherever we were. No- 
body will ever know.” 

“Look,” I said in a voice I 
tried to keep from rising. “There 
are four billion people on Earth 
and about 28 billion in the colo- 
nized Solar planets. Every one of 
those people is on record at Cen- 
tral Cybernetics. How do you 
suppose you!re going to get away 
with the phony adoption of a 
non-existent child? The firsf time 
you have to take it to a baby 
clinic, they’ll find it has no card.” 
“I thought of that,” Lucy said, 
“and it can be done, because it 
must. Frank, for heaven’s sake, 
use your wits! You’re a news- 
gatherer. You know all sorts of 
people everywhere.” 

“I don’t know any machines. 
And it’s machines that handle 
the records.” 

“Machines under the super- 
vision of humans.” 

“Sure,” I said sarcastically. 
“I just go to my ex-newsgatherer 
pal who feeds the records to lo 
or Ceres and say, ‘Look, old fel- 
low, do me a favor, will you? 



My wife wants to adopt a baby 
from your colony, so just make 
up the names of two people and 
give them a life-check, invent 
their ancestors back to the time 
Central Cybernetics was estab- 
lished, and then slip in cards for 
their marriage, and the birth of 
their child — I’ll let you know 
later whether to make it a boy 
or a girl — and then their deaths; 
and then my wife and I can 
adopt that made-up baby.’ 
“What kind of blackmailing 
hold do you think I have on any 
record official,” I asked angrily, 
“to make him do a thing like 
that and keep his mouth shut 
about it? I could be eliminated 
for treason for even making such 
a suggestion.” 

“Frank, think! Surely there 
must be some way!” 

A nd then it struck me. “Wait! 

I just got an idea. When I 
said ‘treason,’ just now — It might 
barely be possible — ” 

“Oh, what?” 

“It would have to be Mars, the 
North Polar Cap colony. The 
K-Alph Conspiracy messed things 
up there badly.” 

“I remember, Mr. Sturt!” Bet

doesn’t want it known, but I have 
inside information that it’s still 
not in going condition. That col- 
ony is full of children who have 
never been registered. And I 
doubt if it will be in 100 per cent 
shape for the best part of another 
year. Those hellions really did 
a job. Let’s see — this is the end 
of Month Two. We’d have to get 
away around Month Eight at the 
latest and the baby would be bom 
— ^when exactly, Bet?” 

“Early in Month Twelve. We 
could all be back here again by 
the first of next year, or even 
by the end of Month Thirteen.” 

“Well, I have enough accumu- 
lated leave for that and I guess 
you have too, Lucy; neither of 
us has taken more than two or 
three weeks for years. But what 
about you. Bet? You’ve been 
working less than a year.” 

“I can borrow it. Our director 
is crazy about travel and she’ll 
be all for it when I tell her I have 
a chance to go to Mars for a 
long visit. Besides, she knows 
about Hal and me — I mean the 
way we are about each other — 
and she’ll understand that I’d 
want to get away for a while 
now.” 

Asher, my editor-in-chief, 
would feel the same way, I 
thought, and so would Lucy’s 
boss. 

“I knew you’d find a way,” re- 
marked my wife complacently. 



I looked at the telechron. 
“We’ve all got to be at work 
in seven hours,” I said, “if we 
expect to get through before the 
end of the afternoon. What say 
we turn in?” 

“You stay here with us. Bet,” 
said Lucy. “You parked your 
copter in our port, didn’t you? 
Frank, I think we need a drink.” 
I pushed the buttons. Nobody 
said anything, but somehow it 
was a toast to Hal. I know the 
liquor had to get past a lump 
in my throat and the women were 
both crying. It wasn’t like my 
self-contained Lucy. I guess she 
thought so herself, for she braced 
herself. But her voice was still 
trembling when she turned to 
Bet. 

“A year from now,” she said, 
“we’ll all be back here in this 
room and, this time, part of Hal 
will be here with us — his son, 
our little Hal.” 

“It might be our little Hallie.” 
Bet smiled through her tears. “It 
will be ten weeks before I can 
run the Schuster test to find out.” 
“It won’t make any difference. 
Hal will never know that, but 
he’ll know, way out there on Lyd- 
na, that his baby has been born. 
He’ll know, even though he can 
never see it — or us.” 

L ucy blinked, then went on 
bravely. “Every time he looks 
in a mirror there, he’ll say to him- 



ONE WAY

self, ‘Well, back on Earth, there’s 
a little tyke with my blue eyes 
and my curly hair and my mouth 
and nose and chin, who’s going 
to grow up to be tall and straight 
like me— or maybe like Bet, but 
also a lot like me.’ 

“And as he grows older, he can 
think back to the way he was as 
a child and a boy and a man, 
and know that his son, or his 
daughter, will be feeling and 
thinking and looking some day 
just about the way he himself is 
then, and it will be a link with 
Earth and with us — ’’ 

That was when I had to go to 
the window and look out for a 
long time to pull myself together 
before I could face them again. 

Lydna is top-top secret, but as 
I’ve said before, we hewsgath- 
erers get inside information. 

I have a pretty shrewd idea 
of what the mysterious Lydna 
Project is. It’s to alter human 
beings so they can adapt to the 
colonization of outer space. 

The medics do things to them 



to enable them and their descend- 
ants to resist every possible con- 
dition of temperature and 
radiation and gravity. They have 
to alter the genes — acquired char- 
acters would be of use only in a 
short-term project, and this is 
long-term. But you can’t alter 
genes without affecting the indi- 
vidual. 

We’d have Hal’s normal child. 

But when Hal got to Lydna, 
he and the rest of them would 
be shocked and sick for a while 
at sight of some of the inhab- 
itants. And if he had any children 
on Lydna, we, back here, would 
scarcely recognize them as hu- 
man. Some of them might have 
extra limbs. Some might have 
eyes and ears in odd places. Some 
might have lungs outside their 
bodies, or brains without a skull. 

By that time, Hal himself 
would have got over being sick 
— unless, some time, he got hold 
of a mirror and remembered the 
boy he used to be.

SATELLITE ONE by Jeffery 
Lloyd Castle. Dodd Mead & Co., 
$3.00 

TVTUEN I first began reading 
” this book, I said to myself, 
“Ochone! Another one of those 
stuffy British jobs!” But when I 
finally laid it down, I said — out 
loud this time — “Eureka] The 
best novel on the first space sta- 
tion yet to appear!” 

The moral: don’t always let 
your momentary distaste for a 
writing style deter you from fur- 
ther reading. This book opens 
with a pretty pompous introduc- 



tory chapter, but once you get 
by that, you are into a genuinely 
enthralling account of tiie plan- 
ning, building, launching, and (in 
space) continuous enlargement 
of the first “Earth satellite vehi- 
cle.” 

Like Arthur Clarke’s rocket in 
his Prelude to Space, this project 
is primarily a British one, though 
there are many scientists of other 
nationalities involved, too. In- 
deed, the book is a fine parallel — 
and extension — of the Clarke tale. 
As in that book, the rocket is 
launched in Australia and (also 
as with the Clarke) there are no

nasty saboteurs and international 
spies, no lurid violence, no cheap 
melodrama — ^just a fine story. 

And there is some wonderful 
descriptive writing as well. Mr. 
Castle’s pictures of life and work 
on the satellite in space are with- 
out doubt the most real and al- 
most poetically vivid I have ever 
read. Indeed, the whole book, 
once you get by the opening few 
pages, is tomorrow’s history giv- 
en solid flesh and bones. 

TO WALK THE NIGHT by 
William Sloane. Dodd, Mead & 
Co., $2.75 

T his novel, which was first 
published in 1937, is definitely 
worth reissue. It is a subtle, mov- 
ing story of mood and character, 
written in the great tradition of 
British fantasy, even though the 
author is an American. 

It tells of the extraordinary 
short life of the lovely and mys- 
terious Selena LeNormand and 
her tragic interludes with two 
men, old Professor LeNormand 
and brilliant young mathemati- 
cian Jerry Lister. Particularly 
fascinating is the quietly fright- 
ening way in which the author 
plays the ancient theme of “pos- 
session” on the new instrument of 
science fiction. 

SCIENCE AND CIVILIZA- 
TION IN CHINA, VOL. I, by 



Joseph Needham. Cambridge 
University Press, $10.00 

■T|ID you know the Chinese 
were the first inventors not 
only of gunpowder and printing, 
but of wheelbarrows, cast iron, 
canal-lock gates, suspension 
bridges, etc., and discoverers of 
magnetic polarity, the science of 
musical acoustics, and so on? 

Did you know that, in the 15th 
century, the Chinese published 
an encyclopedia that ran to the 
incredible total of 11,095 vol- 
umes? 

Did you know that the Chi- 
nese developed, a thousand or 
more years ago, “an organic 
philosophy of nature, closely re- 
sembling that which modern sci- 
ence has been forced to adopt 
after three centuries of mechani- 
cal materialism,” as Needham 
puts it? 

The answer is, of course, that 
most of us know nothing about 
the ancient civilizations of the 
great Asiatic peoples. Here, in 
what James R. Newman, in his 
review in Sdentihc American, 
characterizes as “a landmark of 
intellectual history,” is the first 
of a series of seven volumes by 
Needham which, when all are 
published, will present for the 
first time a coherent and organ- 
ized picture of the- scientific and 
technological — and philosophical 
— achievements of one of our 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



greatest and least known socie- 
ties. 

The present volume, produced 
with a taste and beauty that 
thoroughly measure up to the 
importance of its subject, sets the 
background for the volumes to 
come. In sections on Chinese lan- 
guage, geography, history and 
“Conditions of Travel of Scien- 
tific Ideas and Techniques Be- 
tween China and Europe,” the 
author presents a richly pat- 
terned tapestry of the develop- 
ment of civilization in the Far 
East. 

The book is not a populariza- 
tion; it does not “read like a 
novel;” it is a true work of schol- 
arship. Yet I believe that any 
reader whose interests rise above 
the level of popular fiction will 
find the book and its subsequent 
volumes completely fascinating. 
It is for everyone who is intrigued 
by the unknown, whether future 
(science fiction) or past (scien- 
tific history). 

ANGELS AND SPACESHIPS 
by Fredric Brown. E. P. Dutton 
& Co., 7nc., $2.75 

H ere is a perfectly delightful 
book. Fred Brown has col- 
lected eight of his very best 
stories, and has written es- 
pecially for this book nine 
short-shorts that have all the 
perfection of little diamonds, 



each polished with a keen cutting 
edge. 

“Etaoin Shrdlu” and “The 
Waveries” are my favorites 
among the longer stories, “Po- 
liteness” and “Reconciliation” 
among the short-shorts; but act- 
ually there is not a story included 
that isn’t Class A, with the pos- 
sible exception of the last item, 
a 2 -pager called “Solipsist,” 
which I thought a bit portentous. 

The book’s a lovely job— and 
nicely designed and produced, 
for a change, too. 

OPERATION OUTER SPACE 
by Murray Leinster. Fantasy 
Press, $3.00 

T he indefatigable Leinster! 

This is bis fourth 1954 novel 
— and another 1954 item is on 
hand for review next month, too! 
What a man! 

The current tale, which has 
never been serialized, takes an 
entirely new look at faster-than- 
light travel to the stars: a fast- 
paced, sardonic job that is 
primarily a satire on the future 
of mass communications. 

Fella discovers faster-than- 
light communications technique. 
TV producer says, “Why not 
physical objects, too?” Filthy 
rich neurotic buys “fame-rights” 
to the invention. Luxurious 
spaceship built as giant hoax to 
hook investors in a non-existent

expedition to Mars (the Moon is 
already colonized) becomes the 
first, almost involuntary faster- 
than-light vessel, with as screwy 
a crew as has ever been cooked 
up (including the inevitable and 
delightful Leinster heroine), and 
the whole jaunt to the stars is 
turned into raw material for the 
TV producer’s regular “space op- 
era” show — ^with commercials — 
and what commercials! 

It’s a jolly tale indeed. 

CHILDREN OF THE LENS by 
Edward E. Smith. Fantasy Press, 
$3.00 

W ITH this, the sixth and pos- 
sibly last in the Smith 
space saga, I have a chance to 
re-evaluate the whole series. 
Frankly, I suspect I’ve been a 
bit too rough in my previous re- 
views. Sure, it’s space opera un- 
diluted. Sure, it’s written in a 
style varying from the irritating 
to the infantile. Sure, its charac- 
ters aren’t much more than card- 
board cutouts. 

Even so, you can’t escape the 
fact that the work has appeal. It 
moves! And I believe this new 
and final (?) addition to the se- 
ries is the best of the lot, too. 

My early complaints are still 
valid: impossible weapons, ridic- 
ulous mental powers, a complete 
disregard for the laws of Nature. 
But consider the series as a sort 



of overblown fairy tale for mod- 
em juveniles, with magic “sci- 
ence” substituted for mere magic, 
and I think we have in the Lens- 
man series a pretty solid achieve- 
ment. 

A BUDGET OF PARADOXES 
by Augustus De Morgan. Dover 
Publications, Inc., $4.95 

W HAT Sprague de Camp did 
for the “lost continent” 
crackpots in his book by that 
name (Galaxy, Sept. 1954), De 
Morgan almost does for the per- 
petual motion boys, the “quadra- 
ture” fanatics (squarers of the 
circle), “the quixotic opponents 
of Newton’s physics, the axe- 
grinders who use mathematics as 
a means of bolstering religious 
creeds,” and innumerable other 
oddities, far from all of them 
mathematical. 

In this huge book (over 800 
pages), which was first published 
in 1872 and competently edited 
by an American scholar in 1915, 
the British author collected lit- 
erally hundreds of examples of 
the “debris of barren intellectual 
labor,” as Prof. Ernest Nagel 
puts it in his introduction to the 
current reprint, that have been 
spewed forth through the ages. 

Unfortunately the book is 
rather hard going because of the 
gnarled crochets of the author’s 
style and the total absence of or- 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



der or arrangement of the mate- 
rial. The latter is not always a 
defect, though, since it does mean 
you’re constantly meeting new 
oddities. A section “On Inhabit- 
able Planets,” for example, a 
wonderful doggerel entitled “The 
Astronomer’s Drinking Song,” a 
hot controversy on decimal coin- 
age, and so forth. 

For anyone who is interested 
in seeing how goofy the human 
animal can get in the world of 
science, this monstrous melange 
will prove an endless joy. 

THE STAR BEAST by Robert 
A. Heinlein. Charles Scribnefs 
Sons, $2.50 

N obody but nobody can beat 
Heinlein in the writing of 
teen-age science fiction. I say 
teen-age, since the publisher so 
classifies R.A.H.’s Scribner se- 
ries, of which this is the eighth, 
but the present tale was serial- 
ized in the Magazine of Fantasy 
and Science Fiction, which either 
makes the story adult or mdkes 
all readers of F&SF (and Gal- 
axy, too!) perennal juveniles. So 
what? I sort of like the idea my- 
self! 

This is Heinlein’s first “alien 
invasion” tale for Scribner’s; the 
others have been space opera. 
Small fry of crocodile type was 
brought to Earth from a distant 
star as a pet a few generations 



before the story opens. When we 
meet it, it has grown to be about 
the size of a locomotive. It’s very 
intelligent, too, though no one 
knows that except the two young- 
sters who are its masters. 

The adventures they go 
through in keeping Lummox — 
the book was serialized \mder the 
title Star Lummox — alive make 
up one of Heinlein’s most en- 
chanting tales. 

THE BEST SCIENCE FIC- 
TION SHORT STORIES, 1954, 
edited by Everett F. Bleiler and 
T. E. Dikiy. Frederick Fell, Inc., 
$3.50 

T>Y far the best part of this 
sixth volume in the series of 
Bleiler-Dikty annuals is the per- 
ceptive introduction by Fritz 
Leiber, who also has two stories 
in the book. This introduction 
calls attention to parallels be- 
tween science fiction and the 
great themes of ancient legend, 
which he calls “Icons of Man’s 
Imagination.” 

Of the 13 tales in the collec- 
tion, five have already appeared 
elsewhere in hard covers. Eight of 
the stories, I class as B-plus or 
better; five as average or below. 
It is certainly not the “best” of 
the 1953 output by a long shot, 
but it does contain some of the 
year’s best.

No man could make the Long Haul alone and so 
there had to be somebody behind the bulkhead 
—but the enormously important question was: 




By THEODORE STURGEON 



OU just don’t look through 
viewports very often. 

It’s terrifying at first, of 
course — all that spangled black- 
ness and the sense of disorienta- 
tion. Your guts never get used to 



sustained free-fall and you feel, 
when you look out, that every di- 
rection is up, which is unnatural, 
or that every direction is down, 
which is sheer horror. But you 
don’t stop looking out there be- 

lllustrated by ASHMAN 





100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




WHO? 



101 



cause it’s terrifying. You stop be- 
cause nothing ever happens out 
there. You’ve no sensation of 
speed. 

You’re not going anywhere. 

After the weeks and months, 
there’s some change, sure; but 
from day to day, you can’t see 
the difference, so after a while 
you stop looking for any. 

Naturally, that eliminates the 
viewports as an amusement de- 
vice, which is too bad. There 
aren’t so many things for a man 
to do during a Long Haul that 
he can afford to eliminate any- 
thing. 

Getting bored with the in- 
finities outside is only a reminder 
that the same could happen with 
your writing materials, and the 
music, the stereo and all the rest 
of it. 

Arid it’s hard to gripe, to say, 
“Why don’t they install a such- 
and-such on these barrels?” be- 
cause you’ve already got what a 
thousand spacemen griped about 
long since — many of them men 
with more experience, more im- 
agination and less internal re- 
sources (that is to say, more 
need) than you’ll ever have. Cer- 
tainly more than you have now; 
this is your first trip arid you’re 
just making the transition from 
“inside looking out” to “inside 
looking on.” 

It’s a small world. It better be 
a little complicated. 



A LOT that has happened in 
worlds like these would be 
simple to understand, if you knew 
about it. Not knowing is better, 
though; it keeps you wondering. 
Some of it you can figure out, 
knowing as you do that a lot of 
men have died in these things, a 
lot have disappeared, ship and 
all, and some (but you don’t 
know how many) have been taken 
out of the ships and straight to 
the laughing academy. 

You find out fairly soon, for 
example, that the manual con- 
trols are automaticaly relayed 
out, and stay out of temptation 
until you need them to land. 
(Whether they’ll switch in if you 
need them for evasive maneuver- 
ing some time, you don’t know 
yet.) Who died — how many died 
— because they started playing 
with the manual controls? And 
was it because they decided to 
quit and go home? Or because 
they convinced themselves that 
the auto-astrogator had bugs in 
it? Or because they just couldn’t 
stand all those stationary stars? 

Then there’s this: You’re alone. 
You have a shipmate, but even 
so, you’re alone. You crouch in 
this little cell in the nose of your 
ship, with the curving hull to 
your left and the flat wall of the 
midship bulkhead to your right. 
Because it’s there, that bulkhead, 
you know that in previous models 
it wasn’t. You can imagine what 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



happened in some (how many?) 
ships to make it necessary to seal 
you away from your shipmate. 

Psychodynamics has come a 
long way, but you called this a 
world; well, reduce a world to 
two separate nations and see what 
happens. Between two confined 
entities, there’s no mean and no 
median, and no real way of de- 
termining a majority. How many 
battered pilots have come home 
crazed, cooped up with the shred- 
ded bodies of their shipmates? 

So that’s easy to understand — 
you can’t trust two human beings 
together. Not for long enough. If 
you don’t believe it, look at the 
bulkhead. It’s there because it 
has to be there. 

Being a peaceable guy, it scares 
you a little to know how danger- 
ous you are. 

Makes you a little proud, 
though, doesn’t it? 

Be proud of this, too— that 
they trust you to be alone so 
much. Sure, there is a shipmate; 
but by and large you’re alone, 
and that’s what’s expected of you. 
What most people, especially 
Earthside people, never ted out 
is that a man who can’t be by 
himself is a man who knows, 
away down deep, that he’s not 
good company. You could prob- 
ably make it by yourself alto- 
gether . but you must admit 
you’re glad you don’t have to. 
You have access to the other side 



of the bulkhead, when you need 
it. If you need it. It didn’t take 
you too long to figure out you’d 
use it sparingly. 

You have books and you have 
games, you have pictures and 
text tapes and nine different 
euphorics (with a watchdog dis- 
penser, so you can never become 
an addict) all of which help you, 
when you need help, to explore 
yourself. But having another hu- 
man mind to explore is a wonder- 
ful idea — a wonder tempered by 
the knowledge — oh, how smart 
you were to figure it out in time! 
— ^that the other mind is a last 
resort. If you ever use up the 
potentialities it holds for you, 
you’re through, brother! 

So you have endurance con- 
tests with yourself to see how 
long you can leave that bulkhead 
alone. 

Y OU go back over your life, 
the things you’ve done. Peo- 
ple have written whole novels 
about 24 hours in a man’s life. 
That’s, the way you think it all 
out, slowly, piece by piece ; every 
feature of every face and the way 
they were used; what people did 
and why. Especially why. It 
doesn’t take any time to remem- 
ber what a man did, but you can 
spend hours in thinking about 
why he did it. 

You live it again and it’s like 
being a little god, knowing what’s 



WHO? 



103 



going to happen to everyone. 

When you reported to Base, 
there was a busload of guys with 
you. Now you know who would 
go all the way through the course 
and wind up out here; reliving 
it, you can put yourself back in 
the bus again and say, “That 
stranger across the aisle is Pegg. 
He isn’t going to make it. 
He’ll go home on furlough three 
months from now and he’ll try 
to kill himself rather than come 
back. The freckled nape in the 
seat ahead of you belongs to the 
redhead Walkinok, who will 
throw his weight around during 
the first week and pay expensively 
for it afterward. But he’ll make 
it.’’ 

You make friends with the shy 
dark guy next to you. His name 
is Stein and he looks like a big- 
brain. He’s easy to talk to and 
smart, the kind of* fellow who 
always goes straight to the top. 
And he won’t last even until the 
first furlough; two weeks is all 
he can take, and you never see 
him again. But you remember 
his name. You remember every- 
thing and you go back over it 
and remember the memories in 
between the memories. Did some- 
body on that bus have shoes that 
squeaked? Back you go and 
hunt for it. If it happened, you’ll 
remember it. 

They say anyone can recall 
this way; but for you, with what 



the psycho-dynamicians have 
done to you — or is it for you? — 
you can do more of this than 
anybody. There isn’t anything 
that ever happened in your whole 
life that you can’t remember. 
You can start at the beginning 
and go all the way through. You 
can start at the beginning and 
jump years in a second and go 
through an episode again . 
get mad again . fall in love 
again. 

And when you get tired of the 
events themselves, you can run 
them off again, to find out why. 
Why did Stein go through those 
years of study and preparation, 
those months of competition, 
when all the time he didn’t want 
to be in the Space Service? Why 
did Pegg conceal from himself 
that he wasn’t fit for the Space 
Service? 

S O you cast back, comb, com- 
pare and ponder, keeping 
busy. If you’re careful, just re- 
membering lasts a long time, 
wondering why lasts even longer; 
and in between times, there are 
the books and stereos, the aiito- 
chess and the music . until 
you’re ready to cast and comb in 
your memories again. But sooner 
or later — ^later, if you’re espe- 
cially careful — you’ll get restless 
and your life as it was played 
out, and the reasons why it was 
played just that way, all that 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gets old. You can think of no 
new approach to any of it and 
learn nothing more from it. 

That’s where the centerline 
bulkhead comes in handy. Its 
very shape is a friendly thing 
to you; the hull on your left is 
curved, being part of the ship’s 
side, but the bulkhead is a flat 
wall. Its constant presence is a 
reminder that it has a function, 
like everything else in your 
world; that it is, by nature, a 
partition; that the existence of 
a partition presupposes another 
compartment; and that the other 
compartment is the size and 
shape of this one and designed 
for a similar purpose — ^to be a 
dwelling for someone. 

With no sound nor sign of oc- 
cupancy, the bulkhead still at- 
tests the life behind it, just by 
being there. It’s a friendly flat- 
ness, a companionable feature of 
your world, and its company 
pervades all your thinking. 

You know it’s your last re- 
sort, but you know, too, that it’s 
a rich one, and when at last 
you’re driven to use it, you’ll en- 
ter another kind of world, more 
complex and more engrossing 
than your own, just for the work 
it takes to get from place to 
place and the mystery of the fog 
between the places. It’s a mind, 
another human mind, sharing 
this prison with you when at last 
you need sharing more than any- 



thing whatever in all of space. 

Who is it? 

You think about that. You 
think a whole lot about that. 
Back at Base, in your last year, 
you and the other cadets thought 
about that more than anything. 
If they’d ever given you the 
shadow of a hint . but no; 
wondering about it was appar- 
ently part of your training. You 
knew only that on your Long 
Haul, you would not be alone. 
You had a pretty good idea that 
the choice of a shipmate for you 
would be a surprise. 

You looked around you at 
mess, in class, in the dormitory; 
you lay awake at night dealing 
out their faces in a sort of soli- 
taire game; and sometimes you 
thought about one and said, 
“That’d be fine. We’d get along.” 
And sometimes you said, “That 
stinker? Lock me up with him 
and that bulkhead won’t be 
tough enough. I’ll kill him after 
the third day, so help me!” 

And after they tapped you for 
your first Haul, this was the only 
thing you were scared about — 
who’d be your shipmate. Every- 
thing else, you thought you could 
handle. You knew your job in- 
side out and backward and it 
wouldn’t whip you. You were 
sharp-tuned, fine-honed, ready 
for anything that was under your 
own control. You were even con- 
fident about being alone; it 



WHO? 



H>5 



wouldn’t get you. Not a chance. 

Away down deep, no man be- 
lieves he can be driven out of 
his mind, just as he cannot be- 
lieve — really believe — ^that he will 
be dead. That’s the kind of thing 
that happens to someone else. 

B ut this business of a ship- 
mate — ^this wasn’t under your 
control. You didn’t control who 
it would be and you wouldn’t 
control the guy after blastoff. 
It was the only unknown and 
therefore the only thing that 
scared you. 

Amendment: there was a cer- 
tain amount of control. The in- 
tercom button was on your side 
of the bulkhead. Leave it alone 
and you didn’t have to so much 
as know you had a shipmate im- 
til you were good and ready. 

Eteing able to shut off a voice 
isn’t control, though. You don’t 
know what your shipmate will 
do. Or be. 

In those last tight days before 
blastoff, there was one thing you 
became overwhelmingly aware 
of. Esprit de corps, they call it. 
You and the other graduates 
were hammered into a mold — 
and hammered some more until 
the resiliency was gone out of 
you. You were alike and you did 
things alike because you had 
grown to want to. You knew for 
certain that one of this tight, 
trustworthy little group would 



be picked for you; their training 
and yours, their whole lives and 
yours, pointed toward this ship, 
this Haul. 

Your presence on this ship 
summed up your training; your 
training culminated in your 
presence on the ship. Only a 
graduate cadet was fit to man 
the ship; the ship existed solely 
for the graduate cadet. This was 
something so self-evident that 
you never thought about it. 

Not until now. 

Because now, a few minutes 
ago, you were ready to push that 
button. You couldn’t know if 
you’d broken all records for lone- 
liness, for duration of solitary 
confinement, but you’d tried. 
You’d looked through the view- 
port until it ceased to mean any- 
thing. You’d read until you 
didn’t care any more. You’d lived 
the almost-life of the stereos un- 
til you couldn’t make believe 
you believed them. You’d lis- 
tened to music until it didn’t 
matter. And you’d gone over 
and over your life from its very 
beginnings until you’d complete- 
ly lost perspective on it or any- 
thing and anyone in it. 

You’d found that you could go 
back to the viewport and cycle 
through the whole thing again, 
but you’d done that, too, so often 
that the whole matrix of per- 
sonal involvement was emptied 
out. Then the flatness of the 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bulkhead made itself felt. In a 
way, it seemed to bulge toward 
you, crowd you against the ship’s 
side, and you knew it was getting 
to be time you pushed that but- 
ton and found out for sure. 

Who? 

■pETE or Krakow or that 
crazy redhead Walkinok? Or 
Wendover (you all called him 
Bendover) with all those incom- 
prehensible shaggy-dog stories? 
Harris? Beerbelly Flacker or 
Cohen the Wire-haired Terror? 
Or Shank (what you all called 
him was a shame)? Or Guides, 
whose inexplicable nickname was 
Mickey Mouse? You’d sort of 
hoped it would be Gindes, not 
because you liked him, but more 
because he was the one classmate 
you’d never known very well. He 
always used to look on and keep 
his mouth shut. He’d be much 
more fun to explore than, say, 
old Shank, who was so predicta- 
ble that you could practically 
talk in chorus with him. 

So you’ve tortured yourself, 
just for the sake of torture, with 
your thumb over the intercom 
button, until even the torture 
dried out and blew away. 

You pushed. 

You found out, first of all, that 
the intercom apparently had its 
own amplifier, energized when 
you held the button down, and 
that it took forever — ^well, three 



or four seconds, anyway — ^to 
warm up. First nothing, then a 
carrier, then the beginning of a 
signal; then, at last, the voice of 
your shipmate, rushing up to full 
volume, as loud and as clear as 
if the bulkhead did not exist. 
And you get off that button as if 
it had turned into a needle; and 
you’re backed against the out- 
board bulkhead, deep in shock, 
physically in silence, but with 
that voice going on and on and 
on unbelievably in your unbe- 
lieving brain. 

It was crying. 

It wept wearily, as though you 
had tuned in toward the end of a 
long session of wild and lone- 
some grief. It cried quietly, ex- 
haustedly, without hope. And it 
cried in a voice that was joking- 
ly wrong for this place — a light, 
high voice, nearly a contralto. It 
was wrong, altogether wrong. 

The wild ideas come first: 
Stowaway? 

You almost laugh. For days 
before blastoff, you were drugged 
and immersed in high-frequency 
fields; hypnotized, worked and 
reworked mentally and physi- 
cally. You were passively fed 
and passively instructed. 

You don’t know now and you 
may never know all they did to 
you. But you can be sure it was 
done inside six concentric rings 
of “security” of one kind and an- 
other, and you can be sure that 



WHO? 



lor 



your shipmate got the same. 
What it amoimted to was con- 
centrated attention from a mob 
of specialists, every sleeping and 
waking second from the time you 
beered it up at the class fare- 
well dinner to the time the ac- 
celerator tug lifted your ship and 
carried it screaming up and out- 
ward. Nobody was in this ship 
but those who belonged in it; 
that you can absolutely bank on. 

Mad idea, the second. For a 
while, you don’t even dare think 
it, but with that kind of voice, 
that crying, you have to think of 
something. So you do and you’re 
scared, scared in a way you’ve 
never imagined before, and to a 
degree you didn’t think was pos- 
sible. There’s a girl in there! 

Y OU run those wordless sylla- 
bles, those tired sobs, through 
your mind again, seeking for vo- 
calizations as separated from the 
breathy, painful gasping that ac- 
companied them. And you don’t 
know. You just can’t be certain. 

So punch the button again. 
Listen some more. 

Or ask. 

But you can’t. The crazy idea 
might be true and you couldn’t 
stand that. They couldn’t — ^they 
just couldn’t — put a girl on these 
ships with you and then stow her 
behind the bulkhead. 

Then you have an instant fan- 
tasy about that. You kneel 



(bumping your skull on the 
cover) and feel frantically around 
the bulkhead, where it meets 
deck-plates, nose compartment, 
overhead, after-bulkhead; and all 
around your fingers ride the bead 
of a weld. You sit back, sweat- 
ing a little and half-laughing at 
yourself. Scratch off one fantasy; 
there’ll be no sliding partitions 
into any harems this trip. 

You stop laughing and think, 
“They couldn’t be that cruel I” 
You’re on a test run, sure, and 
it isn’t the ship that’s being test- 
ed. You know that and you ac- 
cept it. But tests, tests . must 
you throw a glass vase on a brick 
sidewalk to find out if it’s brit- 
tle? You see one of your own 
hands going up and out to check 
for a panel, a joint again. You 
sneer at it, at your own hand, 
and watch it stop in embarrass- 
ment. 

Well, say they weren’t that 
cruel. Whom did they put in 
there? 

Not Walkinok. Not Shank. Not 
Harris or Cohen or any cadet. A 
cadet wouldn’t lie there and cry 
like that, like a child, a school- 
girl — a baby. 

Some stranger, then. 

Now the anger comes, shoul- 
dering out all the fear. They 
wouldn’t! This ship is everything 
a cadet was born for — no, made 
for. That tight leash that bound 
you with the others, all your 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thinking, an easy thing you all 
shared and never had to think 
about — ^that was a thing that 
didn’t admit strangers. 

Aside from that — beyond that 
— this wasn’t a matter of dese- 
crated esprit; it was a matter of 
moral justice. Nobody but a ca- 
det deserves a ship! What did 
you give your life to and what 
for? Why did you give up mar- 
riage, and freedom, and all the 
wonderful trivialities called “fun” 
that made most human lives 
worth living? Why did you hold 
still for Base routines and the 
hazing you got from the upper 
classmen? 

Just to have some stranger, 
someone who wasn’t even a ca- 
det, wander in without training, 
shaping, conditioning, experience 
. and get on your ship? 

N O, it has to be a cadet. It 
couldn’t be anything else. 
Even a cadet who could break 
down and cry — that’s a more ac- 
ceptable idea than its being a 
woman or a stranger. 

You’re still angry, but now it’s 
the kind of anger that goads you, 
not the kind that stops you. You 
push the button. You hear the 
carrier, then the beginnings of 
something else . Breathing. 
Difficult, broken breathing, the 
sound of someone too tired to 
cry any more, even when crying 
has changed nothing and there 



are still more tears to come. 

“What the hell are you bawl- 
ing about?” you yell. 

The breathing goes on and on. 
Finally it stops for a moment 
and then a long, whispery, shud- 
dery sigh. 

“Hey!” you shout. “Hey — you 
in there!” 

But there is no answer. The 
breathing is fainter, more regu- 
lar. Whoever it is is going to 
sleep. 

You press even harder on the 
button, as if that would do any 
good, and you yell again, this 
time not even “Hey!” but a 
blunter, angrier syllable. You 
can think only that your ship- 
mate chooses— chooses, by God! 
— not to answer you. 

You’re breathing hard now, 
but your shipmate isn’t. You hold 
your breath and listen. You hear 
the deep, quiet inhalations, and 
then a small catch, and a little 
sigh, the ghost of half a sob. 

“Hey!" 

Nothing. 

You let the button go and in 
the sharp silence that replaces 
the carrier’s faint hum, the same 
wordless syllable builds and 
builds inside you until it bursts 
free again. You can tell from the 
feel of your throat and the ring- 
ing in your ears that it’s been a 
long, long time since you used 
your voice. 

You’re angry and you’re hurt 



WHO? 



109 



from these insults to yourself 
and to your Service. And you 
know what? You feel good. Some 
of the stereos you have are pretty 
nice; they take you right into 
battle, into the arms of beautiful 
women, into danger, and from 
time to time you could get angry 
at someone in them. You could 
— but you haven’t for a long time 
now. You haven’t laughed or 
been angry ever since . since 
. well, you can’t even remem- 
ber when. You’d forgotten how 
and you’d forgotten just when it 
was you forgot. And now look. 
The heart’s going, the sweat . 

This' is fine. 

Push the button again, take 
another little sip of anger. It’s 
been aging; it’s vintage stuff. Go 
ahead. 

You do, and up comes the car- 
rier. 

“Please,” begs the voice. 
“Please, please . say some- 
thing else.” 

VT’OUR tongue is paralyzed and 
you choke, suddenly, when 
you swallow wrong. You cough 
violently, let go the button and 
pound yourself on the chest. For 
a moment, you’re in bad shape. 
Coughing makes your thinking 
go in spurts, and your thinking 
is bouncing up and down on the 
idea that, until now, you didn’t 
really believe there was anyone 
in there at all. You get your wind 



and push the button again. 

The voice asks, “Are you all 
right? Can I do anything?” 

You become certain of some- 
thing else: that isn’t a voice you 
recognize. If you ever heard it 
before, you certainly don’t re- 
member it. Then the content of 
it hits you. Can I do anything? 
You get mad again. 

“Yeah,” you growl. “Hand me 
a glass of water.” You don’t have 
your thumb on the button, so 
you just say what pops into your 
mind. You shake yourself like a 
wet bird dog, take a deep breath, 
and lean on the control again. 

Before you can open your 
mouth, you’re in a hailstorm of 
hysterical laughter. “Glass of 
water . uh-uh-uh . that’s 
good . you don’t know what 
this means,” says the voice, sud- 
denly sober and plaintive. “I’ve 
waited so long. I’ve listened to 
your music and the sound from 
your stereos. You never talk, you 
never say anything at all. I never 
even heard you cough before.” 
Part of your mind reacts to 
that: That’s unnatural, not even 
to cough, or laugh aloud, or hum. 
Must be a conditioning. But 
most of it explodes at this stran- 
ger, this — intruder, talking away 
like that without a word of ex- 
planation, of apology . talk- 
ing as if that voice of all voices 
had a right to be there. 

“I was beginning to think you 



no 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



were deaf and dumb. Or maybe 
even that you weren’t there at 
all. That was the thing that 
scared me the most.” 

“Shut up,” you hiss, with all 
the fury, all the deadly warning 
you can command. 

“I knew they wouldn’t,” the 
voice continues happily. “They’d 
never put anyone out here by 
himself. That would be too — ” 
It stops abruptly as you release 
the button. 

“My God!” you think. “The 
dam has boist! That character’ll 
chunter along like that for the 
duration!” 

You press the button quickly, 
hear “ — all alone out here, you 
get scared to look out the 
viewp — ” and you cut off again. 

rjiHAT stuff like an invisible 
* mist you see melting away is 
all the conjecture, those great 
half-formed plans of shipping 
out with Walkinok or the Wire- 
haired Terror. 

You were going to review your 
courses, remember? Slow and 
easy — take a week on spatial 
ballistics or spectroscopy. Think 
it all through for a day between 
sentences. Or laugh over the time 
you and the Shank got tanked 
up at the canteen and pretended 
you were going to tie up the C.O. 
and jet him off with Colonel Pro- 
vost, the head PD man, for a 
shipmate. The General would get 



all the psychodynamics he need- 
ed. The General was always 
talking psychodynamics, Provost 
was always doing psychodynam- 
ics. 

Well, it seemed funny at the 
time, anyway. It wasn’t so much 
the beer. It was knowing the 
General and knowing Colonel 
Provost that made it funny. How 
funny would it be with a stran- 
ger? 

They give you someone to talk 
to. They give you someone you 
haven’t anything to talk to 
about! That idea of putting a 
girl behind the bulkhead, now, 
that was a horrible idea. It was 
torture. Well, so’s this. Maybe 
worse. 

A thought keeps knocking and 
you finally back off and let it in. 
Something to do with the but- 
ton. You push it and you can 
hear your shipmate. You release 
it and . shut off the intercom? 

No, by the Lord, you don’t! 
When you were coughing, you 
were off that button. Can I do 
anything? 

Now what the hell kind of 
business is this? (And that de- 
tached part of your mind reaches 
hungrily for the pulses of fury: 
ah, it feels good!) Do you mean 
to sit there and tell me (you 
rage silently at the PD men who 
designed this ship) that even if 
I don’t push that button, my 
shipmate can hear everything 



WHO? 



Ill 




112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that goes on with me? The inter- 
com’s open on the other side all 
the time, open on this side only 
when I push the button — is that 
it? 

You turn and glare out the 
viewport, staring down the cold, 
distant eye of infinity, and 
Where the hell, you storm si- 
lently, js my privacy? 

This won’t do. It won’t do at 
all.. You figured right from the 
start that you and your shipmate 
would be pretty equal, but on a 
ship, even a little two-passenger 
can like this, someone’s got to be 
in command. Given that the 
other compartment has the same 
stereos, the same dispensers, the 
same food and water and every- 
thing else, and the only differ- 
ence between these living quarters 
is that button — ^who’s privileged? 
Me, because I get to push the 
button? Or my shipmate, who 
gets to listen in on me when I 
so much as cough? 

“I know!” you think suddenly. 
“That’s a PD operative in there! 
A psychodynamics specialist as- 
signed to observe me!” 

Y OU almost laugh out loud; 

relief washes over you. PD 
work is naturally hush-hush. 
You’ll never know how many 
hours during your course you 
were under hypnosis. It was even 
rumored around that some guys 
had cerebral surgery done by the 



PD boys and never knew it. The 
boys had to work in secret for 
the same reason you don’t stir 
your coffee with an ink-stick — 
PD is one field where the tools 
must leave no mark. 

Well, fine, fine. At last this 
shipmate makes some sense: at 
last you’ve got an answer you 
can accept. This ship, this trip, 
is of and for a cadet — ^but it’s PD 
business. The only non-cadet 
who’d conceivably be aboard 
would have to be a PD tech. 

So you grin and reach for the 
button. Then, remembering the 
way it works, that the intercom’s 
open from your side when you’re 
off the button, you draw your 
hand back, face the bulkhead, 
and say easily, “Okay, PD, I’m 
on to you. How’m I doing?” You 
wonder how many cadets tumble 
to the trick this soon. You push 
the button and wait for the an- 
swer. 

The answer is “Huh?” in a 
mixture of shyness and mystifi- 
cation. 

You let go the button and 
laugh. “No sense stringing it out. 
Lieutenant.” (This is clever. 
Most PD techs are looeys; one 
or two are master sergeants. 
Right or not, you haven’t hurt 
his feelings.) “I know you’re a 
PD man.” 

There’s a silence from the 
other side. Then: “What’s a PD 
man?” 



WHO? 



113 



You get a little sore. “Now see 
here, Lieutenant, you don’t have 
to play any more of these psych 
games.” 

“Gosh, I’m no lieutenant. I — ” 
You cut him off quickly. “Ser- 
geant, then.” 

“You got me all wrong,” says 
that damnable high voice. 

“Well, you’re PD, an5way.” 
“I’m afraid I’m not.” 

You can’t take much more of 
this. “Then what the hell are 
you?” 

A silence. And as it beats by, 
that anger and that fear of tor- 
ture begin to mount, hand in 
hand. 

“Well?” you roar. 

“Well,” says the voice, and 
you can practically see it shuffle 
its feet, “I’m not anything. I’m 
fifteen years old . .” 

You drag out your senior-class 
snap; there’s a way of talking to 
fourth and third classmen that 
makes ’em jump. “Mister, you 
give an account of yourself, but 
now. What’s your name?” 
“Skampi.” 

“Skampi? What the hell kind 
of a name is that?” 

“It’s what they call me.” 

Did you detect a whisper of 
defiance there? “Sir!” 

The defiance disappears in- 
stantly. “It’s what they call me 
. sir.” 

“And what are you doing on 
my ship, mister?” 



A FRIGHTENED gulp. “I— 
I’m sorry — uh — sir. They 
put me on.” 

“They?” 

“At the Base . sir,” he 
amended quickly. 

“You were on the Base just 
how long, mister?” That “mis- 
ter” can be a lead-shot whiplash 
if you do it right. It was sure 
being done right. 

“I don’t know, sir.” You have 
the feeling the punk’s going to 
burst into tears again. “They 
took me to a big laboratory and 
there were a lot of sort of booths 
with machines in them. They 
asked me all kinds of questions 
about did I want to be a space- 
man. Well, I did. I always did, 
ever since I was a kid. So, after 
a while, they put me on a table 
and gave me a shot and when I 
woke up, I was here.” 

“Who gave you a shot? What 
was his name?” 

“I never ... I didn’t find out, 
sir.” A pause. “A big man. Old. 
He had gray hair, very short, 
and green eyes.” 

Provost, by God. This is PD 
business, all right, but from 
where you sit, it’s monkey busi- 
ness. 

“You know any spatial ballis- 
tics?” 

“No, sir. Some day, I — ” 
“Astrogation?” 

“Only what I picked up my- 
self. But I’ll—” 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Gravity mechanics? Differen- 
tials? Strength of materials? 
Light-metal fission? Relativity?” 

«I_,r 

“Well? Well? Speak up, mis- 
ter!” 

“I heard of them, sir.” 

“ ‘I heard of them, sir!’ ” you 
mimic savagely. “Do you know 
what this ship is for?” 

“Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knows 
that. This is the Long Haul. 
When you come back from this, 
you get your commission and 
they give you a starship!” And 
if the voice had shuffled its feet 
once, now its eyes shone. 

“You figure to get a starship, 
mister?” 

“Well, I— I—” 

“You think they give com- 
mands to Boy Scouts just be- 
cause the Boy Scout wants to go 
to space awful bad?” 

No answer. 

You jeer, “Have you got the 
slightest idea how much train- 
ing a cadet has to go through, 
how much he has to learn?” 

“Well, no, but I guess I will.” 

“Sir!” 

“Sir. They put me aboard, all 
those officers who asked me the 
questions and everything. It must 
be all right. Hey\” he says ex- 
citedly, all the crushed timidity 
disappearing, to be replaced by a 
bubbling enthusiasm. “/ know! 
We have all this time . maybe 
you’re supposed to teach me as- 



trogation and relativity and all 
that.” 

Your jaw drops at the sheer 
childishness of it. And then 
something really ugly drifts up 
and smothers everything else. 

F or some reason, your mind 
flashes back to the bus, the 
day you got to Base. You can 
remember back easily to all the 
faces you worked with, those who 
made it and those who didn’t. 
But your class had thirty-eight 
cadets in it and that bus must 
have held fifty. What happened 
to the rest? You’d always as- 
sumed they went into other sec- 
tions — ground crew, computer 
men, maintenance. Suppose 
they’d been sorted out, exam- 
ined for some special trait or 
talent that only the PD men 
knew about? Suppose they were 
loaded right aboard ships, each 
with a graduate cadet? 

And why? 

Suppose these punks, green- 
horns, Boy Scouts, children — 
suppose they were the ones slat- 
ed for a commission? Suppose 
guys like you, thinking all this 
while you were the cream of the 
crop, and the top cream off that 
— suppose all along you’d tested 
out as second-grade material. 
Suppose you were the one who 
did the sweating and cramming 
and took the hazing and the de- 
merits and the lousy mess-hall

food, not to command a star- 
ship, not to get a commission, 
but just to be a private tutor to 
a boy genius who wanted to go 
to space awful bad? 

This wouldn’t make sense any- 
where else but in the starship 
service. It barely made sense 
there, but look: 

A starship commander might 
make two trips in his whole ca- 
reer, that’s all. Eighteen years 
each round trip, with his passen- 
gers in coldpacks and a cargo of 
serums, refractories, machine 
tools and food concentrate for 
the xenologists and mineralogists 
who were crazy enough to work 
out there. 

Training the commander for 
such a ship was easy, as far as 
operating knowledge was con- 
cerned, though there was a pow- 
erful lot of it. But training him 
to stay conscious, awake and 
aware — and alone — ^for all those 
years was something else again. 
Few men like that were born; 
they had to be made. 

Most of your recluses, your 
hermits, all through history, 
have been guys who had things 
drastically wrong with them. 
There couldn’t be anything wrong 
with a starship commander. He 
had to be captain and deck crew, 
and know his black-hole as well 
(though most of the drive ma- 
chinery down there was auto- 
matic) and stay alert — stay sane 



— in a black, mad, weightless 
emptiness God never made him 
for. 

G ive him more books and 
pictures, games and music 
than even he would have time for 
and you’d still not be sure he’d 
stay sane unless he had some 
very special inner resources. 

These (and one other thing) 
were what a cadet was screened 
for and what he was trained in. 
PD packed him full of techni- 
cal knowledge, psyched him to a 
fare-thee-well, and when they 
figured he was machine-finished 
and carrying a high gloss, they 
sealed him in a space can and 
threw it out for the Long Haul. 

The course was pre-set, and it 
might last 14 months, and it 
might last three years, and after 
a guy got back (if he got back), 
he would be fit to take out a 
starship or he would not. As for 
the shipmate — well, you’d always 
assumed that PD was looking for 
a way to shake down two guys at 
once so they could be together 
on a starship. 

Maybe, some day, the ships 
would carry eight, ten at once, 
and at last natural human gre- 
gariousness would have a chance 
to compete with the pall of black 
distances. So far, though, psy- 
chic disorientation had made ev- 
erything that was latently mean 
and murderous in a man explode

into action. Putting more than a 
single human being on those 
boats to nurse them through was 
just asking for slaughter. And 
shipwreck. 

The other thing required of 
you besides technical ability and 
these inner resources is — youth. 
You’re only twenty-two, so full 
of high-intensity training that, as 
Walkinok once said, you feel 
your brain convolutions are blown 
out smooth like a full bladder. 
And you’ve compacted this 
knowledge, coded it, used it. 
You’re so full of it that it’s 
bound to ooze out onto anyone 
aroimd you. 

You’re twenty -two and you’re 
sealed up in a can with a thirsty- 
headed fifteen-year-old who 
knows nothing, but wants to go 
to the stars awful bad. And you 
can forget how stupid he seems 
to be, too, because you can bet 
your bulging cortex that the kid 
has such an enormous I.Q. that 
he can afford to act stupid and 
cry. 

What a dirty, rotten, lousy 
deal to put you through all this 
just to shave seven years off the 
age of a starship commander! 
Next thing you know, they’d put 
a diapered baby in with a work- 
weary sucker of a fine-honed ca- 
det and get three star trips out 
of him instead of two! 

And what’s to become of you? 
After you’ve done your generous 



stint of tutoring, they pin a dis- 
charge emblem on your tunic and 
say, “Well done. Cadet. Now go 
raise Brussels sprouts.’’ And you 
stand at attention and salute 
the downy-cheeked squirt in all 
the gold braid and watch him 
ride the gantry crane to the con- 
trol cabin you’ve aimed at and 
sweated for ever since you were 
weaned! 

You sprawl there in that liv- 
ing space, so small that you can’t 
stand up in it, and you look at 
that bland belly of a bulkhead 
with its smooth, round navel of 
a button, and you think, “Well, 
there’s a lot of guts back of that.” 
You heave a deep breath, while 
still the detached part of your 
mind looks on. Now it’s saying 
wonderingly, “Aren’t you the 
guy who was scared because 
nothing could get him excited 
any more?” And you speak and 
your voice comes out sounding 
quite different from anything 
you’ve ever heard from anyone 
before. Maybe you’ve never been 
this mad before. 

“Who told you to say that?” 

Y OU push the button and lis- 
ten. 

“Say what — uh — sir?” 

“About me teaching you. Any- 
body at Base?” 

He seems to be thinking. 
“Why, no, sir. I just thought it 
would be a good idea.” 



WHO? 



117 



You don’t say an3rthing. You 
just hold the button down. 

He says diffidently, “Sort of 
pass the time?” When you still 
don’t say anything, he adds wist- 
fully, “I’d try. I’d try awful 
hard.” 

You let go the button and 
growl, “I just bet you would. 
You just thought it up all your 
own little self, huh?” 

“Well, yes.” 

“You’re a bright boy. You’re 
a real, smart, ambitious little 
louse!” 

You push the button real 
quick, but all you get is an aston- 
ished silence. 

You say, real composed, al- 
most gentle, “That ‘louse,’ now, 
that’s not just a figure of speech, 
little boy. I mean that. I mean 
you’re a crummy little crawler 
looking to suck blood after some- 
body else has done all the work. 
You know what you do? You 
just make like you’re all alone in 
this can. You don’t talk to me 
and you don’t listen to me and 
I’ll do you a favor — I’ll forget 
all about you, too. I’m not going 
to bat your eyeballs together just 
yet, but don’t call me generous, 
little boy — ^never that.' It’s just 
that I can’t reach in there just 
now.” 

“No!” That boy can make a 
real piteous noise when he wants 
to. “No, no! Wait — ^please!” 

“Well?” 



“I don’t under — I mean I’m 
sorry. Cadet. I’m honest-to-Pete 
sorry. I never meant — ” 

But you cut him off. You lie 
back and close your eyes. You’re 
thrumming with fiiry right down 
to your toenails. 

This, says your internal ob- 
server, is all right. This is living. 

S O the weeks pass, and so do 
more weeks. You shoot a star 
and make some notes, and wait a 
while and shoot it again, and 
pretty soon you have enough 
data to fool around with. You 
get your stylus and block, and 
the point darts around the way 
you want it to, and those old fig- 
ures sit up and lie down and 
rush around just the way you 
want them to. You laugh when 
you do it; wouldn’t Junior just 
love to learn some of these tricks? 

Anyway, you figure you’re just 
past the cusp perihelion of your 
parabola and you’re starting 
back. You know how far you’ve 
cpme and when you’ll get back. 
You laugh again. The sound of 
your voice reminds you he can 
hear you, so you crawl over to 
the bulkhead and push the but- 
ton. 

“Cadet,” he says. “Please, Ca- 
det. Please.” His voice is hoarse 
and weak; the syllables come out 
as if they’re meaningless from 
repetition. He’s probably been 
lying in there for weeks bleating 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Cadet — please— cadet — please” 
every time you clicked the stylus 
against your teeth or set the 
quadrant on your Sun gun. 

You spend a lot of time look- 
ing out the viewport, but you get 
sick of that and turn to the 
euphorics. You see a lot of stereo 
shows. You are always aware of 
the button in the bulkhead, but 
you ignore it. You read. You get 
a lot of use out of the octant; it 
seems you take a lot more bear- 
ings than you have to. And when 
at last the button starts to be 
intrusive, you make a real effort 
and leave it alone; you figure out 
something else to do instead. 

You take a careful survey of 
your instruments to figure which 
one you need least, and finally 
decide on the airspeed indicator. 
You’ve spent plenty of time in a 
mockup and you know you can 
compute your airspeed when you 
return to Earth by the hull-tem- 
perature plus your ground-rise 
radar. 

You dismount the instrument 
and take it apart and get the 
diamond bearing. You go through 
the games locker and the equip- 
ment chest until you put to- 
gether a nickel rod and a coil, 
and you hook on to your short- 
range radio where the oscilla- 
tions suit you. You cement the 
diamond to the tip of the rod, 
shove the rod through the long 
axis of the coil. You turn on the 



juice and feel (rather than hear) 
the rod humming softly. 

“The phenomenon, dear pu- 
pil,” you say, but silently, “is 
magneto-striction, whereby the 
nickel rod contracts slightly in 
the magnetic held. And since the 
field is in oscillation, that dia- 
mond on the tip is vibrating like 
crazy.” 

You get your stylus and, 
after careful consideration, de- 
cide on a triangle with round cor- 
ners, just big enough to shove an 
arm through comfortably; the 
three comers would make peep- 
holes. 

A ll the while, you have quick 
fantasies about it. You’ll 
knock the triangular piece out of 
the bulkhead and stick your face 
in the hole and say “Surpriser’ 
and he’ll be cowering there, won- 
dering what goes on. And you’ll 
say, “Shake and let bygones be.” 
And he’ll jump over, all eager, 
and you’ll take his hand and drag 
it through the hole and put your 
back against the bulkhead and 
pull till his shoulder dislocates. 

He’s gasping, “Cadet, please,” 
until you get tired of amusing 
yourself and haul the wrist 
around and sink your teeth in it. 
Then he starts to bleed, and you 
just hold him there while “Cadet- 
please” gets fainter and fainter, 
and you explain to him all about 



WHO? 



119 



differential equations and mass- 
ratios. 

And as you’re thinking about 
this, you’re going round and 
round the blunted triangle with 
your vibrating diamond. The 
bulkhead is thick as hell and 
tough — it’s hull-metal; imagine 
that, for an inboard bulkhead! — 
but that’s all right. You’ve got 
plenty of time. And bit by bit, 
your scored line goes deeper. 

Every once in a while, you 
take a breather. It occurs to 
you to wonder what you’ll say 
when you’re grappled in and the 
Colonel sees that hole in the 
bulkhead. You try not to won- 
der about this, but you do all 
the same, a whole lot. You run it 
over in your mind and sometimes 
the Colonel says, “Good, Cadet. 
That’s real resourcefulness, the 
kind I like to see.’’ But other 
times it doesn’t quite come out 
that way, especially with the kid 
dead on one side of the bulk- 
head and his blood all over the 
place on the other side. 

So maybe you won’t kill him. 
You’ll just scare him. Have fun 
with him. 

Maybe he’ll talk, too. Maybe 
this entire Long Haul was set up 
by PD just to find out if you’d 
cooperate with your shipmate, 
try to teach him what you know, 
at any cost. And you know, if 
you thought more of the Service 
than you do about your own 



dirty career in it, that’s just what 
you’d do. Maybe if you did that, 
they’d give you a starship, you 
and the kid both. 

So, anyway, this cutting job 
is long and slow and suits you 
fine; no matter what you think, 
you go on with it, just because 
you started. When it’s finished 
you’ll know what to do. 

Funny that the result of this 
trip was going to be the same as 
some of those you’d heard whis- 
pered about, where a ship came 
in with one guy dead and the 
other . 

But that was the difference. 
To do a thing like that, those 
guys must have been space- 
happy. You’re doing it, sure, but 
for different reasons. You’re no 
raving looney. You’re slow-and- 
steady, doing a job, knowing ex- 
actly why. 

Or you will, when the time 
comes. 

You’re real happy this whole 
time. 

Then all that changes. 

J UST why, you can’t know. 

You turned in and you slept, 
and all of a sudden you’re wide 
awake. You’re thinking about 
some lab work you did. It was a 
demonstration of eddy-current 
effects. 

There was a copper disk as 
thick as your arm and a meter in 
diameter, swinging from a rope 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in the center of the gymnasium. 
You hauled it up to the high 
ceiling at the far end and turned 
it loose. There was a big electro- 
magnet set up in the middle of 
the place, and as the disk reached 
the bottom of its long swing, it 
passed between the poles of the 
magnet, going like hell. You 
threw the switch and the disk 
stopped dead right where it was 
and rang like a big gong, though 
nothing had touched it. 

Then you remember the sixty 
zillion measurements you’d taken 
off a synchro-cosmotron so huge 
that it took you four minutes at 
a fast walk to get from one end 
to the other. 

• You remember the mockups, 
the hours and hours of hi-G, 
no-G; one instrument out, an- 
other, all of. ’em, some of ’em; 
simulated meteorites on collision 
orbit; manual landing techniques 
— until your brains were in your 
hands and the seat of your pants, 
and you did the right things with 
them without thinking. Exhaust- 
ed, you still did it right. Even 
doped up. 

You remember the trips into 
town with Harris and Flacker 
and the others. Something hap- 
pened to you every time you so 
much as walked down a street 
with those guys. It was a thing 
you’d never told anyone. Part of 
it was something that happened 
between the townspeople and 



your group. Part of it was be- 
tween your group and yourself. 
It all added up to being a little 
different and a little better . 
but not in a cocky way. In a way 
that made you grateful to the 
long, heavy bulk of a starship 
and what such ships are for. 

You sit up in your bunk, with 
that mixed-up, wide-awake feel- 
ing, reaching for something you 
can’t quite understand, some one 
simple thing that would sum up 
the huge equipment, the thou- 
sands of measurements, the hours 
of cramming and the suspense 
of examinations; the seat-of-the- 
pants skills and the pride in 
town . 

And now you see what it is. 

That kid in there, he could 
have an I.Q. of nine goddam hun- 
dred and never learn how to put 
down a ship with all his instru- 
ments out and the gyros on man- 
ual. Not by somebody telling 
him over an intercom when he’s 
never even sat in a G-seat. He 
might memorize twelve thousand 
slightly varying measurements 
off a linear accelerator, but he 
wouldn’t gain that certain im- 
portant thing you get when you 
make those measurements your- 
self. You could describe the way 
the copper disk rang when the 
eddy current stopped it, but he 
would have to see it happen be- 
fore it did to him all the things 
it did to you. 



WHO? 



121 



still don’t know who that 
kid is or why he’s here, but 
you can bet on one thing — he 
isn’t here to pick your brains and 
take your job. You don’t have 
to like him and you can be mad 
he’s aboard instead of Harris or 
Walky; but get that junk out of 
your head right now about him 
being a menace to you. Goddle- 
mighty Godfrey, where did that 
poisonous little crumb in your 
brain come from? Since when are 
you subject to fear and jealousy 
and insecurity? Since when do 
you have to guard yourself 
against your own imagination? 

Come the hell off it. Cadet. 
You’re not that good a teacher; 
he’s not that much of a monster. 

Monster! Did you hear him 
cry that time? 

You feel twenty pounds light- 
er (which is odd, seeing that 
you’re still in free-fall) and as if 
you’d just washed your face. 
“Hey, Krampi!’’ 

You go push the button and 
wait. Then you hear a sharp in- 
halation through nostrils. A sniff 
. no, you won’t call it that. 

“Skampi, sir,’’ he corrects you 
timidly. 

“Okay, whatever you say. And 
knock off that ‘sir.’ ’’ 

“Yes, sir. I mean yes.” 

“What were you crying 
about?” 

“When, s— ?” 

“Okay,” you break in gently. 



“You don’t have to talk about 
it.” 

“No. I wasn’t trying to deny 
it. I . cried twice. I’m sor- 
ry you heard me. You must 
think . .” 

“I don’t think,” you say sin- 
cerely. “Not enough.” 

He thinks that over and ap- 
parently drops it. “I cried right 
after blastoff.” 

“Scared?” 

“No . yes, I was, but that 
wasn’t why. I just . .” 

“Take your time telling me. 
Time is what we got nothing else 
but of.” 

“It was just that I — I’d al- 
ways wanted to be in space. I 
thought about it in the daytime 
and dreamed about it at night. 
And all of a sudden, there it was, 
happening to me for real. I . 
thought I ought to say something 
and I opened my mouth to do 
it and all of a sudden I was cry- 
ing. I couldn’t help it. I guess 
I — Crazy, I guess.” 

“I wouldn’t say so. You can 
hear talk and see pictures and 
get yourself all ready, but there’s 
nothing like doing it. I know.” 
“You, you’re used to it.” 

H e seems to want to say some- 
thing else; you hold the but- 
ton down. Finally, with difficulty, 
he asks, “You’re big, aren’t you? 

I mean you’re . you know. 
Big.” 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“WeU, yes.” 

“I wish I was. I wish I was 
good for . well, something.” 

“Everybody push you 
around?” 

“Mm.” 

“Listen,” you say. “You take 
a human being and put him down 
next to a starship. They’re not 
the same size and they’re not the 
same shape, and one of ’em’s 
pretty insignificant. But you can 
say that this built this, not the 
other way around.” 

“Y-e-eah.” It is a whisper. 

“Well, you’re that human be- 
ing, that self-same one. Ever 
think of that?” 

“No.” 

“Neither did I, till now,” you 
admit rapidly. “It’s the truth, 
though.” 

He says, “I wish I was a ca- 
det.” 

“Where do you come from, 
kid?” 

“Masolo. It’s no place. Jerk 
town. I like big places with big 
things going on. Like the Base.” 

“Awful lot of people charging 
around.” 

“Yeah,” he says. “I don’t like 
crowds much, but the Base — it’s 
worth it.” 

You sit and look at the bulk- 
head. It’s companionable, sud- 
denly, and sort of changed, as if 
it had just grown warm, or quilt- 
ed. You get a splinter of light off 
the bright metal where you’ve 



scored it. You think it’s down 
pretty deep. A man could stand 
up to it and knock that piece out 
with a maul, if a man could 
stand up, if he had a maul. 

You say, very fast, as if you’re 
afraid something’s going to stop 
you, “Ever do anjdhing you were 
really ashamed of? I did when 
I talked to you the way I did. I 
shouldn’t’ve done it like that . 
I don’t know what got into me. 
Yes, I do and I’ll tell you. I was 
afraid you were a boy genius 
planted on me to strip my brains 
and take my command. I got 
scared.” 

It all comes out like that. You 
feel much better and at the same 
time you’re glad Walkinok or 
Shank aren’t around to hear you 
spout like that. 

T he kid’s very quiet for a 
while. Then he says, “One 
time my mother sent me to the 
market and something was a spe- 
cial, I forget what. But anyway I 
had forty cents change and I for- 
got about it. I foimd it in my 
pants in school next day and 
bought a starship magazine with 
it and never told her. I used to 
get every issue that way after 
that. She never missed the mon- 
ey. Or maybe she did and didn’t 
say anything. We were pretty 
hard up.” 

You understand that the kid 
is trying to give you something. 



WHO? 



123 



because you apologized to him. 
You don’t say anything more 
about that. Right here, a wonder 
starts to grow. You don’t know 
what it is, but you know that 
standoff-and-watch part of your 
mind is working on it. 

You say, “Where is this Ma- 
solo?’’ 

“Upstate. Not far from Base. 
Ever since I was a baby, the axi- 
tugs were shaking the house when 
they took off. There’s a big tree 
outside the house and all the 
leaves shiver — ^with the tugs, you 
know. I used to climb out a limb 
and get on the roof and lie down 
on my back. Sometimes you 
could see the starships orbiting. 
Just after the Sun goes down, 
sometimes you can . .’’ He swal- 
lows: you can hear it plainly. “I 
used to put out my hand. It was 
like a firefly up there.” 

“Some firefly,” you say. 

“Yeah, Some firefly, all fight.” 
Inside you, the wonder is turn- 
ing to a large and luminous 
astonishment. It’s still inexpres- 
sible, so you leave it alone. 

The kid is saying, “I was with 
two other fellows out by the 
high school one time. I was just 
a kid— eleven, I think. Well, 
some gorillas from the high 
school chased us. We ran and 
they caught up with us. The 
other kids started to fight them. 
I got over to one side and, when 
I had a chance, I ran. I ran all 



the way home. I wish I’d stayed 
there with those other two kids. 

“They got the tar kicked out 
of them and I guess it hurt, but 
I guess it stopped hurting after 
some teacher came along and 
broke up the fight. But I hurt 
every time I think about running 
away like that. Boy, did those 
two give me a razzing when they 
saw me next day! Boy\ So what 
I wanted to ask you, you don’t 
think a kid who would run away 
like that could be a cadet.” 

He ends it like that, flat. No 
question. 

Y OU think about it. You’ve 
been in some fine brawls as a 
cadet. You’re in a bar and some- 
one cracks wise, and your blood 
bubbles up, and you wade in, 
feeling giant-size. But maybe 
that’s just because of the busi- 
ness of belonging. 

You say carefully, “I think if 
I was in a fight, I’d rather have 
a guy on my side who knew what 
being scared felt like. Then it 
would be like having two guys 
on my side, instead of one. One 
of the guys wouldn’t care if he 
got hurt and the other guy 
would never want to be hurt that 
way again. I think a fellow like 
that would be a pretty good ca- 
det.” 

“Well, yeah,” says the kid, in 
that funny whisper. 

Now the inner astonishment 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bursts into sight and you recog- 
nize what it is about this kid. 

At first, you were scared of 
him, but even when that went 
away, you didn’t like him. There 
was no question of liking him or 
not liking him; he was a different 
species that you couldn’t have 
anything to do with. 

And the more you talked with 
him, the more you began to feel 
that you didn’t have to set your- 
self apart from him, that he had 
a whole lot you didn’t have — 
and that you could use it. The 
way he talked, honest and un- 
abashed; you don’t know how to 
do that. You nearly choked to 
death apologizing to him. 

It suddenly is very important 
to get along with this kid. It isn’t 
because the kid is important. It’s 
because if you can get along with 
somebody so weak, so wet behind 
the ears, and yet in his peculiar 
way so rich, why, you can get 
along with anybody, even your 
own lousy self. 

And you realize that this thing 
of getting along with him has ex- 
tension after extension. Some- 
how, if you can find more ways 
to get along with this kid, if you 
can see more things the way he 
sees them with no intolerance and 
no altitude, you’ll tap something 
in yourself that’s been dried up 
a long time now. 

You find all this pretty amaz- 
ing, and you settle down and talk 



to the kid. You don’t eke it out. 
You know he’ll last all the way 
back to Base and have plenty 
left over. You know, too, that by 
the time you get there, this Idd 
will know a cadet can also be a 
louse. You can give him that 
much. 

The way you treated him, he 
was hurt. But you know? He 
wasn’t mad. He doesn’t think 
he’s good enough to get mad at a 
cadet. He thinks a cadet rates 
what he does just by being a 
cadet. 

Well, you are going to fix that. 

T he time goes by and the 
time comes;' the acceleration 
tug reaches out and grabs you 
high above Earth, so, after all 
that manual-control drill, you 
don’t have a thing to do, but sit 
there and ride it down. 

The tug hovers over the com- 
pound right near the administra- 
tion building, which disappears 
in a cloud of yellow dust. You 
sink down and down in the dust 
cloud until you think they must 
be lowering you into a hole in 
the ground. Then, at last, there’s 
a slight thump and an inhuman 
amount of racket as the tug 
blasts away free. 

After that, there’s only the 
faint whisper of the air circula- 
tor, the settling dust, and a pro- 
foundly unpleasant feeling in 
calves and chest as the blood gets

used to circulating in a 1-G en- 
vironment. 

“Now don’t you forget, Skam- 
pi,” you say. You find it difficult 
to talk; you’ve got a wide grin 
plastered across your face and 
you can’t cast it adrift. “Just as 
soon as they’re through with you, 
you come looking for me, hear? 
I’ll buy you a soda.” 

You lean back in your G-chair 
and hold the bulkhead button. 

“I can drink beer,” he says 
manfully. 

“We’ll compromise. We’ll make 
your soda with beer. Listen, kid. 
I can’t promise, but I know 
they’re fooling with the idea of 
a two-man crevT for starships. 
How’d you like to go with me — 
one trip, anyhow? Of course, 
you’ll have to be conditioned six 
ways from the middle, double- 
time, and it’ll be real rough. But 
— what do you say?” 

And you know? He doesn’t say 
anything! 

He laughs, though. 

N OW here comes Colonel Pro- 
vost, the big big brass of 
Psychodynamics, and a young 
M.P. That’s all the welcoming 
committee you’ll get. The com- 
pound’s walled and locked, and 
no windows look out on it. They 
must have unloaded some pretty 
sorry objects from these space 
cans from time to time. 

They open the hatch from the 




126

outside and you immediately 
start coughing like hell. Your 
eyes say the dust has settled, but 
your lungs say no. By the time 
you have your eyes wiped, the 
M.P. is inside and squatting on 
the deck, cross-legged. 

He says cheerfully, “Hi, kay- 
dee. This here’s a stun gun and 
if you so much as squint at me 
or the Colonel, you get flaked 
out like a heaving-line.” 

“Don’t worry about me,” you 
say from behind that silly grin. 
“I got no quarrel with anybody 
and I like it here. Good morning, 
Colonel.” 

“Look out for this one,” said 
the M.P. “Likes it here. He’s 
sick.” 

“Shut up, wheelhead,” says 
the Colonel cheerfully. He has 
his gray crewcut and barrel torso 
shoved into the hatch and it’s 
real crowded in that little cabin. 
“Well, Cadet, how are we?” 

“We’re fine,” you say. The 
M.P. cocks his head a little to 
one side and gets bright-eyed. 
He thinks you’re sassing the 
C.O., but you’re not. When you 
say “we,” you mean you and 
your shipmate. 

“Anything special happen?” 

The answer to that is a big fat 
yes, but it would take forever to 
tell. It’s all recorded, anyway; 
PD doesn’t miss a trick. But 
that’s from then till now, and 
done with. You’re concerned with 



from now on. “Colonel, I want 
to talk to you right now. It’s 
about my shipmate.” 

The Colonel leans a little fur- 
ther in and slaps the M.P.’s gun 
hand. He’s in front of the guy, 
so you can’t see his face. “Beat 
it, wheelhead.” 

The M.P. clears out. You 
stagger up out of the G-seat and 
climb through the hatch. The 
Colonel catches your, arm as you 
stagger. After a long time in 
free-fall, your knees won’t lock 
as you walk; you have to stiffen 
each one as your weight comes 
on it, and you have to concen- 
trate. So you concentrate, but 
that doesn’t stop you from talk- 
ing. You skim over the whole 
business, from your long solo to 
being reduced to meeting your 
shipmate, and the hassel you had 
with yourself over that, and then 
this thing that happened with 
the kid — weeks and weeks of it, 
and you’ve only just begun. 

“You can pick ’em, sir,” you 
pant as you lurch along. “Do 
you always use a little know- 
nothing kid? Where do you find 
’em? Does it always work out 
this well?” 

“We get a commander out of 
every Long Haul,” he says. 

“Say, that’s great, sir!” 

“We don’t have very many 
ships,” he says, just as cheer- 
fully. 

“Oh,” you say. 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



S UDDENLY you stop. “Wait, 
sir! What about Skampi? He’s 
still locked in on his side of the 
bulkhead.” 

“You first,” says the Colonel. 
You go on into the PD lab. “Up 
you go.” 

You look at the big chair with 
its straps and electrodes and big 
metal hood. 

“You know, they used chairs 
like these in the French Revolu- 
tion,” you say, showing off. 
You’re just busting with friend- 
liness today. You never felt like 
this. You sit in the big chair. 
“Look, sir, I want to get started 
on a project right away. This 
kid, now — I tell you, he’s got a 
lot on the ball. He’s spaceman 
right to the marrow bones. He 
comes from right around here, 
that little place up the pike, Ma- 
solo. He got shook out of his 
bassinet by the axi-tugs. He 
spent his childhood lying on his 
back on the roof looking for the 
starships in orbit. He’s — ” 

“You talk all the time,” the 
Colonel breaks in mildly. “Sum 
up, will you? You made out with 
your shipmate. You think you 
could do it again in a starship. 
That it?” 

“Think we can try it? Hey, 
really? Look, can I be the one to 
tell him. Colonel?” 

“Close your mouth and sit 
still.” 

Those are orders. You sit still. 



The Colonel gets you strapped in 
and connected up. He puts his 
hand on the switch. 

“Where did you say you came 
from?” 

You didn’t say, and you don’t, 
because the hood swings down 
and you’re surrounded by a sud- 
den dissonant chord of audio at 
tremendous amplitude. If you 
had been allowed to say, though, 
you wouldn’t have known. 

The Colonel doesn’t even give 
you time to be surprised at this. 
You sink into blackness. 

I T gets light again. You have 
no idea how much time has 
passed, but it must be plenty, 
because the sunlight from out- 
side is a different color and slants 
a different way through the Ve- 
netian blinds. On a bench nearby 
is a stack of minicans with your 
case number painted on each one 
— ^that’d be the tape record of 
your Long Haul. There’s some 
stuff in there you’re not proud 
of, but you wouldn’t swap the 
whole story for anjdhing. 

“Hello, Colonel,” you say with 
your tongue thick. 

“You with us again? Good.” 
He looks at an enlarged film- 
strip and back at you. He shows 
you. It’s a picture of the bulk- 
head with the triangular score in 
it. “Magneto-striction vibrator, 
with a diamond bearing for a 
drill bit, hm? Not bad. You guys

scare me. I’d have sworn that 
bulkhead couldn’t be cut and 
that there was nothing in the 
ship that could cut it. You 
must’ve been real eager.” 

“I wanted to kill him. You 
know that now,” you say hap- 
pily. 

“You damn near did.” 

“Aw, now. Colonel! I wouldn’t 
have gone through with it.” 

“Come on,” he says, opening 
the buckles. 

“Where, sir?” 

“To your space can. Wouldn’t 
you like to have a look at it from 
the outside?” 

“Cadets aren’t permitted — ” 

“You qualify,” says the old 
man shortly. 

So out you go to the compound. 
The can still stands where it was 
landed. 

“Where’s Skampi?” you ask 
worriedly. 

The Colonel just passes you 
an odd look and walks on. Yoii 
follow him up to the can. “Here, 
around the front.” 

You walk around to the bow 
and look up at it. It’s just the 
shape it ought to be from the 
way it looked from inside, ex- 
cept that it looks a little like a 
picture of a whale caught wink- 
ing at you. 

Winking? 

One-eyed! 

“Do you mean to tell me you 
had that kid in a blind compart- 



ment, without so much as a 
viewport?” you rage. 

The Colonel pushes you. “Sit 
down. Over there. On the hatch. 
You returning heroes and your 
manic moods . sit down!” 
You sit on the edge of the open 
hatch. 

“Sometimes they fall over 
when I explain,” he says gruffly. 
“Now what was bothering you?” 
“Locking that kid up in a 
dark — ” 

“There isn’t a kid. There isn’t 
a dark cabin. There’s no view- 
port on that side of the can. It’s 
a hydrazine tank.” 

“But I— but we— but the—” 
“Where do you come from?” 
“Masolo, but what’s that to — ” 
“What did your mother and 
all the kids call you when you 
were a space-struck teener?” 
“Scampy. They all — Scampy?” 
“That’s right,” he says blunt- 
ly. 

R ocked, you cover your 
face. “By God! I can re- 
member now, thinking back in 
detail over my whole life — it 
started in the bus that day I 
passed the entrance exams. What 
is it? Please, what is it?” 

“Well, if you want me to get 
technical, they call it Dell’s hy- 
pothesis. It was formulated way 
back in the middle of the 20th 
century by Dudley Dell, which 
was one of the pseudonyms of a 



130 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



magazine editor. As I remember 
it, he later became a lay analyst 
and — ” 

“Please, Colonel!” You’re in 
trouble. 

“Okay, okay,” he says sooth- 
ingly. “Well, up to that time, 
psychiatry had been banging its 
head against a stone wall — ^usu- 
ally banging up the patient in 
the process. Those early thera- 
pists knew that childish feelings 
and motivations were interfering 
with adult efficiency and happi- 
ness. When a man would slam 
out of his house and do a lousy 
day’s work after a fight with his 
wife, the doctor would tell him, 
‘You’re acting as if you were a 
child rejected by its mother,’ and 
this was — ” 

“Colonel, sir, are you going to 
please tell me what the hell’s with 
me?” 

“I am,” he answers calmly. 
“This, as I was beginning to ex- 
plain, was all wrong because the 
‘as if concept kept the patient 
from distinguishing his adult 
feelings and motivations from 
those of the child within him — a 
very viable, hard-fighting, but 
frightened and confused kid it 
was, too. And smart. Smart 
enough, at any rate, to see rejec- 
tion for just what it was. And if 
it went far enough, the doctor 
would say hopelessly, ‘Mm-/imm, 
schizophrenia,’ thereby scaring 
the liverwurst out of the patient. 



Dell stopped all that wreckage.” 
“Dell stopped all that,” you 
repeat, suffering. 

“It was a little thing, that hy- 
pothesis of’ his — ^little like 
E = MC* or Newton’s apple — 
but, oh, my, what happened!” 
“Oh, my,” you agree. “What 
happened?” 

“Dell began directing therapy 
to the infantile segment, treating 
it as a living, thinking, feeling 
organism. It responded so excel- 
lently that it changed the face of 
psychoanalysis. Now in your case 
— you’re not going to interrupt?” 

Y OU shake your head blankly 
but obediently. 

“Good. In your case, an exten- 
sion of Dell’s hypothesis was 
used. The sum total of your life 
up until you took your entrance 
examinations to this Base was ar- 
rested at the age of 15. A hsrp- 
notic barrier was erected so that 
you could have no access to any 
of this. You — all of you cadets — 
literally start a new life here, 
with no ties whatever to an ear- 
lier one. Your technical educa- 
tion very deliberately has no 
reference factors to anything but 
itself. You learn quickly because 
your minds are uncluttered. You 
never miss your past because 
we’re careful never to reactivate 
it. 

“When this approach was first 
tried, the subjects were gradu- 



WHO? 



131 



ated with memories only of their 
training. Well, it didn’t work. 
Childhood conditioning is too 
important to the entire human 
being to be wiped out without 
diminishing the subject in just 
about every emotional way. So 
we developed this new system. 
That’s what we used on you. 

“But we discovered a peculiar 
thing. Even in untrained adults 
— as opposed to the sharp divi- 
sion of pre- and post-entrance 
you have here — even untrained 
adults suffer to greater or lesser 
degree from internal strife be- 
tween childhood and adult in- 
terpretations and convictions. An 
exaggerated example would be a 
child’s implicit belief in Santa 
Claus and the Easter bunny, ex- 
isting at one and the same time 
with the adult’s realization that 
these are only legends. The inner 
child — ^the child within the adult 
— still exists, according to Dell 
and to all tests since, and will 
fight like the very devil for sur- 
vival, beliefs and all . espe- 
pecially one whose beliefs and 
natural feelings and reactions 
had been made grounds for pun- 
ishment or ridicule. 

“The schism between you and 
Scampy was extreme; you were, 
in effect, bom on different plan- 
ets. To be a complete human be- 
ing, you had to be integrated. 
But to be integrated successfully, 
you and Scampy had to leam 



how to get along together. For 
Scampy, this was not difficult — 
you, even in injustice and cru- 
elty, were a real live hero-image. 
But the adult you had a stonier 
path. Somewhere within your- 
self, though, you somehow found 
an element of tolerance and em- 
pathy, and used it to bridge the 
gap. 

“I may say,” added the Colo- 
nel severely, “that it takes a par- 
ticularly fine kind of person to 
negotiate this difficult merger. 
But I also have to say that it’s 
always completed.” 

“Always?” you ask, astonished. 

“In every single case. I know 
there are all sorts of rumors 
about psychotics being taken out 
of the space cans — the M.P.s 
standing by when we open them 
reinforce the rumors, but that’s 
only precautionary in case it ever 
happens. It hasn’t yet and I 
doubt if it will.” 

R emembering those sto- 
ries and thinking about your 
own taste of private hell, you 
protest, “But I almost went nuts. 
Colonel!” 

“Not a chance,” he says. “That 
was the value of Dell’s hypothe- 
sis — ^by being able to contact the 
child within you (and it exists 
in every adult, if you’re wonder- 
ing), you could make friends 
with him. Stop frowning! What 
else could you do with such an 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



eager, friendly, admiring kid? 
And that admiration is impor- 
tant — because he has such con- 
fidence in you, you will, too. And 
that confidence lets him relax so 
you can take over situations 
you’ve been trained to handle 
arid he hasn’t. 

“Well, that’s what Dell discov- 
ered was the cause of emotional 
difficulty, which he substituted 
for the ancient and useless ‘neu- 
rosis’ and ‘psychosis’ labels. 
When the child within is contact- 
ed and reassured, as you did on 
this trip, he can leave the con- 
trols to the adult. And, as I said, 
it always happens. The child feels 
secure because it’s liked and be- 
cause it trusts the adult self and 
is trusted. The adult self also 
feels liked and trusted. Well, 
what else could that produce but 
a person at peace with himself?” 

“But he talked to me! Don’t 
tell me you’ve secretly invented a 
telepathic converter with band- 
pass filters!” 

“Of course not. How are your 
thoughts expressed to you? As 
abstract symbols? As wordless 
cerebration? No. You literally 
talk to yourself, but subvocally. 
You have a subminiature trans- 
mitter placed surgically in your 
pharynx. The button on your 
bulkhead activated it. There had 
to be a button, you see; we 
couldn’t have the two of you 
speaking at the same time, which 



is what persons in the same room 
invariably do. You can’t subvo- 
calize and talk simultaneously. 
It would have tipped you off. 
Hence the button.” 

“I can’t get used to it,” you 
complain. “I can’t! I practically 
saw the boy! Listen, Colonel — 
can I keep my built-in transmit- 
ter and have the same rig on my 
starship?” 

He smiles, although you think 
it hurts his face. “You really 
want it left as is?” 

“He’s a great kid.” 

“Very well — Commander. Dis- 
missed.” He marches away. 

VT’DIJ look after him, shaking 
your head. Then you duck 
into the space can. You stare at 
the bulkhead and at the button 
and at the scoring on the plate 
where you came that close to 
filling your cabin with your hy- 
drazine supply. You shudder. 

“Hey,” you call softly. “Scam- 
py!” 

You push the button. You hear 
the carrier. Then, “I’m thirsty,” 
says Scampy. 

You cut out of there and go 
down to the rec area and into the 
short-order bar. 

“A beer,” you say. “And put a 
lump of vanilla ice cream in it. 
And two straws.” 

“You crazy?” asks the man. 
“No,” you say. “Oh, no!”

Smart man, Bruckner— he knew 



how to handle natives . but 



they knew even better how to 



deal with smart terrestrials! 



Iltustrated by KOSSIN 



B ruckner was a man 

deeply imbued with a 
sense of his own worth. 
Now as he rested his broad beam 
on the joined arms of Sweets and 
Majesky, he winked to include 
them in a “this is necessary, but 
you and I see the humor of the 



thing” understanding. Like most 
thoroughly disliked men, he con- 
sidered himself quite popular 
with “the boys.” 

The conceited ham’s enjoying 
this, Sweets thought, as he stag- 
gered down the aisle under the 
big man’s weight. At the ship’s 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



entrance, he glanced out across 
the red-sand plain to where the 
natives waited. 

They wore little clothing, 
Sweets noted, except the chief. 
He sat on his dais — carried on 
the shoulders of eight of his fol- 
lowers — dressed in long stream- 
ers of multi-colored ribbons. 
Other ribbons, rolled into a rope, 
formed a diadem on his head. 

The only man more impres- 
sively dressed was Bruckner. He 
wore all the ceremonial trappings 
of a second century Gallic king, 
complete with jewel-studded gold 
crown. 

As Sweets and Majesky grunt- 
ed with their burden across the 
ten yards separating the ship 
from the thronelike chair that 
had been brought out earlier, 
their feet kicked up a cloud of 
red dust that coated their cloth- 
ing and clogged their nostrils. 

The dust had originally been 
red ferric sand. But the action of 
winds and storms had milled it 
together, grain against grain, 
through the ages, until it had be- 
come a fine red powder that hung 
in the hot still air after they had 
passed. 

Most of Waterfield’s Planet, 
they had discovered on their in- 
spection flight the day before, 
had been a desert for more cen- 
turies than they could accurately 
estimate. Its oases, however, were 
large and plentiful and, as ob- 



served from the air, followed a 
clear-cut, regular pattern. The 
obvious conclusion was that they 
were fed by underground rivers. 

T he crewmen deposited their 
burden in the chair and stood 
waiting. 

“Nice work, men,” Bruckner 
muttered in an undertone. “Now 
keep up the act. Bow from the 
waist and retire discreetly to the 
background.” 

Majesky said something under 
his breath as they complied. 

The greeting ceremony got off 
to a good start after that. Sweets 
had to admit. Whatever else 
might be said of Bruckner, he 
knew his job as a psychologist. 

Bruckner rose to his feet, raised 
his right hand, palm forward^ and 
intoned gravely, “Earthmen greet 
you.” He spoke in the language 
of the natives. 

The tribal chieftain raised his 
hand negligently in reply, but 
neither rose nor spoke. 

With a great display of mag- 
nanimity, Bruckner sent over a 
bolt of bright red cloth. 

The chieftain accepted the gift 
and sent back a large wooden 
box carried by two of his men. 
They lowered the box at Bruck- 
ner’s feet and one of them opened 
a door in its side. 

The large animal — or bird; the 
Earthmen couldn’t be certain 
which — that stepped out stood

about seven feet tall, with a body 
shaped like a bowling pin. It 
walked on webbed feet that an- 
gled outward, had short flippers, 
set low on a body covered with 
coarse hair that might have been 
feathers, and was armed with 
long, vicious claws. There was 
something so ludicrous about its 
appearance that Sweets had diffi- 
culty stiffing the chuckle that 
rose in his throat. 

The animal, however, took it- 
self very seriously. When it saw 
its audience — the spaceship’s 
crew — watching, it took two 
spraddling steps forward, pulled 
the bulk of its pot-bellied stom- 
ach up into its chest and paused 
dramatically. 

It gave three very loud, 
hoarse burps, somewhere between 
the squawk of a duck and the 
braying of an ass. It was a hilari- 
ously funny caricature of a 
pompous orator. 

Someone snickered. Immedi- 
ately Sweets and the other crew 
members joined in the laughter. 
It was the kind of belly-laughing 
that could not be restrained. 

While he roared. Sweets took 
time to observe Bruckner. At the 
first outbreak of laughter, the 
psychologist scowled and glanced 
nervously across at the natives. 
But when he saw that they, too, 
had joined in the laughter, he 
allowed himself to smile conde- 
scendingly. 



The meeting ended with much 
apparent good will on both sides. 

“TJ7ELL, I guess we knew what 
” we were doing, didn’t we?” 
Bruckner said after they were 
back in the ship. 

He made a point of emphasiz- 
ing the we. 

“At the time Waterfield’s 
Planet was first discovered,” he 
explained, “the official report was 
that the natives were friendly. 
However, when the survey team 
landed a year later, they ran into 
trouble. At the beginning, they 
were courteous and considerate 
in their dealings with the natives, 
but the tribesmen took that as a 
sign of weakness and gave the 
team very little cooperation. 
Then they tried being a bit tough 
and found themselves with a 
small war on their hands. They 
were lucky to get away with their 
lives. So you can see why I’m 
pleased with the way things went 
off today.” 

“If the natives are that touchy, 
we’ll still have to be careful,” 
Sweets said. “What are we sup- 
posed to be doing here, anyway?” 
Bruckner looked carefully 
around the circle at each of his 
listeners. “There’s no reason now 
why I shouldn’t tell you,” he 
said confidingly. “The survey 
team found enough traces of rare 
elements here to suspect that 
there might be large deposits on 



BIG STUPE 



137 



the planet. That’s what we’re 
after.” 

“And you think there might be 
trouble?” Majesky asked. Bruck- 
ner had his full attention now, 
Sweets noted. There was always 
a kind of leashed vitality about 
Majesky that made him poor 
company during a space trip, but 
he was the type of man you’d 
want on your side in a rough- 
and-tumble. 

“I certainly do not,” Bruckner 
answered, frowning in annoy- 
ance. “It’s my job to see that we 
don’t have trouble. I went very 
carefully over the records of the 
two previous landings, even be- 
fore we began this trip, and I 
believe I understand the psycho- 
logical compulsions of these 
tribesmen quite well.” 

“You mean you know what 
makes ’em tick?” Majesky asked. 

“Yes, I think I can safely say 
I do,” Bruckner said modestly. 
“Their culture pattern is based 
on a long history of tribal con- 
flict. And, for a tribe to prosper, 
they must have a strong as well 
as resourceful leader. Thus the 
splendid dress of their chieftain 
this morning, in contrast to the 
drabness of the ordinary tribal 
dress. He must be, very appar- 
ently, a man above the common 
tribesmen to hold their respect. 

“And that,” Bruckner added, 
“was the reason for our little act 
this morning. The best way to 



impress them with our power is 
to display the magnificence of 
our leader. The better we can 
keep them convinced of my 
greatness, the less risk there will 
be of trouble.” 

T>IG Stupe — someone gave 
their pet the name the first 
five minutes and it stuck — had 
the run of the ship. Individually 
and in groups, the crew took 
turns amusing themselves with 
him. And Big Stupe accepted 
everything they did very seri- 
ously and loved the attention. He 
was definitely a gregarious ani- 
mal. 

And his name fitted perfectly. 
His gullibility and invariable 
stupidity seemed to have no lim- 
its. He fell for the same practical 
jokes over and over again. He 
was clumsy and stumbled over 
furniture, loose objects and even 
his own feet. 

He would eat anything. If 
what he swallowed proved indi- 
gestible, he would stand for a 
minute with an astounded ex- 
pression on his hairy face and 
then whatever he had eaten 
would come rolling up. He eager- 
ly gulped down the same rubber 
ball a dozen times in the space 
of ten minutes. Whenever spoken 
to, he replied promptly, in his 
incredible squawking bray. A 
“hello,” by one of the crew, with 
an answering bray from Big 



138

Stupe, was always good for a 
laugh. 

Big Stupe had a fear of loud 
noises and pulled a variation of 
the ostrich-head-in-hole routine, 
at every unexpected loud sound, 
of turning his back to whatever 
had frightened him and peering 
cautiously back under, a flipper. 
If a tail feather was pulled, he’d 
make a determined and pro- 
longed effort to run straight 
through the ship’s wall, flapping 
and treadmilling and skidding 
and pushing his beak against it. 

Another of his tricks was the 
dispensing of pebbles — which he 
seemed to consider very valuable 
gifts — ^from his marsupial pouch 
to the crew members who took 
his fancy. 

Sweets often wondered how 
an animal with so little common 
intelligence had survived the 
evolutionary process. He could 
spot no counterbalancing ability 
or survival characteristic. But 
somehow the species had escaped 
extinction. 

O N the second day, Bruckner 
sent Sweets and Teller, the 
head engineer, to the chief with 
a present and samples of rare 
ores. Sweets’ duties, on the trip 
out, had included the learning of 
the native language. 

The sun was hot and Sweets 
wore only his shoes, trousers and 
a T shirt. It seemed absurd that 



a sun that appeared no larger 
than an egg should be so hot. But 
he knew it generated all that heat 
because it was a blue sun and not 
one of the ordinary yellow-white 
type, as it appeared. The decep- 
tive appearance was caused by 
the heavy atmosphere that held 
out the ultraviolet and the heat 
and light came in on the yellow 
band. Last night, the darkness 
had had a dim violet haze. 

The interview with Chief Faf- 
fin went quite smoothly. He re- 
ceived the Earthmen with great 
cordiality and Sweets was certain 
that he detected in the chieftain’s 
manner more than mere cour- 
tesy. He seemed to have a genu- 
ine liking for them. He accepted 
gravely the gyroscope top which 
Bruckner had sent and agreed, 
without argument or reserva- 
tions, to send his men in search 
of the ores that matched the 
samples Sweets showed him. 

He would be happy to assist 
his friends, the Lacigule, the 
chief said. Lacigule was the na- 
tives’ name for the Earthmen, 
used in both the singular and the 
plural. 

The same afternoon, a dozen 
natives brought samples of ores 
to the ship. At Bruckner’s orders. 
Sweets gave each native a comb 
from the ship’s supply of trading 
goods. 

During the evening. Teller and 
his men set up a portable mass 



BIG STUPE

spectograph separator at the 
mine site and, three days later, 
they had the hold of the ship 
two-thirds full. 

During all this time, the crew 
members had been restricted to 
the vicinity of the spaceship and 
by the third day were showing 
signs of unrest. They sent Sweets 
to talk with Bruckner and the 
captain. 

“We’ll be leaving here in a few 
days,” Sweets told them. “It’s 
been a long trip out and it’ll be 
another long trip back. The men 
feel they’re entitled to some fun 
before they go.” 

“That seems like a reasonable 
request,” the captain said. “What 
do you think, Mr. Bruckner?” 
“It would be risky to let them 
mingle too freely with the na- 
tives,” Bruckner advised. “We 
aren’t familiar enough with the 
local customs. One wrong move 
might spoil all the good will I’ve 
been able to build up so far.” 
“Unless you let them have a 
little fun, you’re going to be 
awfully unpopular,” Sweets said. 
Without knowing it, he was 
something of a psychologist him- 
self. 

“Hmmm.” Bruckner was 
thoughtful. “I’m for the men,” 
he said finally. “One hundred 
per cent. Let’s say we wait until 
tomorrow evening, though. We’ll 
have the hold just about filled by 
that time. Then it won’t matter 



too much if the natives change 
their minds about letting us take 
the ores. How does that soimd to 
you?” 

“Fair enough,” Sweets agreed. 

T he next evening, a full- 
fledged party was held. Per- 
mission had been obtained from 
Chief Faffin for the crew to visit 
the village and the tribesmen 
were waiting for them when they 
arrived. 

Sweets stayed close to Ma- 
jesky. For the past couple days, 
the big crewman had been drink- 
ing — not heavily, but steadily. 
The irritation of being restricted 
to the ship and vicinity, added 
to the long trip out from Earth, 
had gradually built up in him an 
ugly resentment. 

Now as the crew members sat 
in a circle watching the dancing 
of a half-dozen native men. 
Sweets noted that Majesky was 
drunk. He sat with his arms 
wrapped aroimd his legs, his 
head resting on his knees, and 
glared at the dancers. Outside 
the circle, a pile of brush burned 
with much crackling of wood- 
pitch. 

After the dance was over, the 
natives sat solemnly watching 
the Earthmen. It was soon ap- 
parent that they expected their 
visitors to furnish the next por- 
tion of the entertainment pro- 
gram.

Evidently Bruckner had come 
prepared for this. He rose im- 
pressively from his throne — on 
which he had been carried the 
quarter-mile from the ship — and 
said, “We’ll have your song now, 
Billy.” 

Billy Watts, astrogator of the 
crew, pulled himself to his feet 
and, in a high boyish tenor, sang 
I'll Take You Home Again, 
Kathleen. 

Sweets felt his throat quicken 
as a wave of homesickness went 
through him like a chill. At the 
song’s end, it needed the yip, yip, 
yip of the tribesmen’s applause 
to bring him out of his memories 
of Earth. 

The tribesmen continued their 
applause until Watts rose again. 
Sweets wondered if they had any 
music of their own. The men had 
danced earlier without accompa- 
niment and they had made no 
sound themselves. 

Billy Watts sang two more 
songs and it was the tribesmen’s 
turn again. 

Suddenly a native woman ran 
out from behind one of the 
round, mud-packed village huts 
and into the circle of spectators. 
She paused on tiptoe, crouched 
and sprang upward, twisting and 
screaming as she rose. She land- 
ed with her legs in driving mo- 
tion and went through a racing, 
energetic series of gyrations. She 
was almost completely unclothed. 



F or a stunned moment, the 
men sat motionless in pleased 
surprise. Then Sweets caught a 
movement from the comer of his 
eye and shifted his head to look 
at Majesky. For the first time in 
many days, Majesky appeared 
happy. He had straightened up 
and his eyes shone with a glow 
of approval. He raised his arms 
in a gesture of encouragement 
and yelled, “Swing it, baby!” 
The dancer’s stride broke and 
her head turned sharply in Ma- 
jesky’s direction. Then she ig- 
nored the intermption and went 
on with her dance. 

But Majesky was not to be 
ignored. He climbed to his feet 
and stood with his head hunched 
between his shoulders, watching 
her. Then he . lurched forward, 
caught the girl up in his arms 
and swung her around in a stag- 
gering circle. 

It had happened too suddenly 
for any of the Earthmen to stop 
him, and now they were unable 
to decide just what they should 
do. Most of them turned to 
Bruckner. 

To Sweets, it seemed that 
Bruckner had gone pale, but it 
was difficult to be certain in the 
uneven light cast by the fire. His 
mouth opened twice before he 
could speak. And when he did. 
Sweets almost laughed at the 
staginess and absurdity of what 
he said. 



BIG STUPE 



141 



“Unhand that woman!” Bruck- 
ner commanded. 

Bruckner’s voice was loud and 
it penetrated through the haze of 
Majesky’s drunken elation. He 
stopped his spinning and set the 
girl on her feet, but he kept his 
right arm around her waist and 
glared back at Bruckner. 

“Go to hell,” he said. 

The natives apparently had 
been as surprised as the crew, for 
they had not moved. Now, how- 
ever, one of them rose and lunged 
at Majesky. 

Majesky’s face twisted into an 
expectant grin and he tossed the 
girl aside and stood with wide- 
spread legs, waiting. As the na- 
tive dived in with his head 
lowered, Majesky brought his 
right fist up in a powerful up- 
percut and smashed it into the 
tribesman’s mouth. 

The native continued his dive 
and landed face down. Natives 
and Earthmen were on their feet 
now and moving toward Ma- 
jesky. Sweets reached him first. 

The grin of pleasure was still 
on Majesky’s face as he hit 
Sweets on the left cheek and 
spun him half-around. He butted 
his head into the chest of the 
next man to reach him, but they 
pulled him down then and held 
him helpless. 

The natives had paused when 
they saw the Earthmen grab 
Majesky. 



Now Bruckner made his voice 
heard above the noise. “Bring 
him over here!” he yelled. 

Two men pinned Majesky’s 
arms while a third held one kick- 
ing leg. They dragged him over 
to Bruckner. 

“You damn, dumb fooj!” 
Bruckner cursed fervently. He 
raised his voice. “All of you,” he 
ordered, “back to the ship!” 

The natives made no attempt 
to stop them. 

Sweets glanced back over his 
shoulder at Chief Faffin as they 
went. He was standing and in- 
toning sadly, “Ladgule, lacigule, 
lacigule.” 

T he following day, Bruckner 
called Sweets to his quarters. 
“That was a rotten piece of 
business last night,” Bruckner 
said. “But I’m proud of the way 
you acted. You did some mighty 
quick thinking there.” 

Sweets grunted. He knew the 
flattery was leading to something. 

“I’ve been giving the matter 
some deep thought since,” Bruck- 
ner continued, “and I don’t think 
it’s too late yet to patch things 
up. But I need a man with guts.” 
He laughed. “How brave do you 
feel this morning?” 

Sweets shrugged and regarded 
the other leVelly. 

“You can speak their lan- 
guage,” Bruckner said. “And I 
don’t believe they’re sure enough 



142

of themselves to risk bloodshed. 
How would you like to bring an- 
other present to the chief? I’ll see 
that you’re — ” 

“I don’t feel like being a hero 
this morning,” Sweets inter- 
rupted. “Why don’t you go your- 
self?” 

Bruckner’s eyebrows raised. 
“My job is vital to the success 
of this expedition to risk my life 
unnecessarily. I’d go myself ex- 
cept — ” 

“Except that it’s too danger- 
ous,” Sweets finished for him. 

Bruckner straightened and his 
lips grew narrower. “That will be 
enough of that. We’ll find some 
way to get along without your 
help.” 

The party Bruckner organized 
to visit the native village point- 
edly did not include Sweets. 

Each man carried a rifle and 
sidearms. Bruckner walked this 
time — at their head. But Sweets 
made a small bet with himself 
that Bruckner would stay close 
to the protection of his men. He 
was willing enough to send an- 
other man out alone, but when 
he had to go himself, he made 
sure that he was well protected. 

Bruckner and his men had 
been gone almost an hour when 
Sweets heard the sound of Big 
Stupe’s hoarse squawking from 
outside the ship. There seemed 
to be anger in the tones. Before 
Sweets reached the open portal of 



the ship, he heard more excited 
squawks. They were similar to 
Big Stupe’s, but they weren’t be- 
ing made by him. 

Outside, Sweets found Big 
Stupe facing three others of his 
breed, exchanging loud angry 
squawks. Soon they began to 
walk rapidly in their pseudo-dig- 
nihed spraddles, each in a small 
circle. 

Abruptly they were locked to- 
gether and it was soon apparent 
that this was no game. Big Stupe 
pulled with both flippers at the 
head of one of his visitors, while 
another systematically raked his 
long claws down the sides of Big 
Stupe’s neck. Before Sweets could 
reach him, the neck was stream- 
ing with blood. 

Sweets remembered how Big 
Stupe had always been afraid of 
loud noises and he raised his 
voice in a shout. The other stupes 
turned their backs, but Big Stupe 
brought one flipper around and 
hit Sweets squarely between the 
eyes. 

A S Sweets stood stunned, he 
felt Big Stupe’s body crash 
against his shoulders and this 
time, when he yelled, it was in 
alarm and fear. 

Then he was free and his eyes 
swam back into focus. He saw 
Big Stupe standing with his back 
turned. The three visitors were 
shambling off awkwardly. 



BIG STUPE 



143 



Sweets left Big Stupe and 
stumbled back to the ship. 

Bruckner returned well pleased 
with his trip. 

“I’d say we handled that ex- 
actly right,” he said. “I don’t 
know if the other expeditions 
contacted this particular tribe or 
not, but at least stories must 
have reached them of the po- 
tency of the Earthmen’s weapons. 
When we showed them that we 
preferred peace, but were ready 
to fight if necessary, that was the 
end of the affair. And the pres- 
ents we had for Faifin, and for 
the native that Majesky hit, 
didn’t hurt any. The one thing 
to keep in mind is that we’ve got 
to make them respect us. And 
those lads have plenty of respect 
for Lacigule right now.” 

It seemed that Bruckner was 
right. There was no further diffi- 
culty with the tribesmen as the 
engineers completed their mining 
and separating operations and 
finished filling the hold of the 
ship. 

T WO days later, they w^re 
ready to leave. 

“Can we take Big Stupe along 
with us when we go?” one of the 
crewmen asked Bruckner. Most 
of them were standing outside 
the ship, taking a last look 
around at Waterfields Planet. 
The ship had been made space- 
ready and all preparations for 



departure had been completed. 

“I see no reason why not,” 
Bruckner answered. “He cer- 
tainly helps keep our morale up. 
I wonder,” he went on in an ex- 
pansive mood, “if you men real- 
ize why you get such a kick out 
of Big Stupe. You ought to read 
Hobbs’ essay on the basis of hu- 
mor sometime. 

“Hobbs does a fine job of 
showing that we enjoy humor 
because it caters to our need for 
self-approval. When a monkey 
falls out of a tree, all the other 
monkeys laugh, because it makes 
them feel so clever and wise for 
not having fallen out of their 
tree. Whenever Big Stupe pulls 
one of his outlandish stunts, we 
are all reminded of how much 
smarter we are. It makes us feel 
good and so we like Big Stupe. 
We like anybody or anything 
that makes us feel superior.” 

A few of the natives who had 
been watching the preparations 
for departure from a distance 
walked closer. 

Bruckner turned and waved 
cheerfully to them. “Farewell, 
friends. Perhaps we’ll see you 
again in a few years.” He paused. 
“I’ve been wondering,” he said, 
pointing at Big Stupe, “what's 
your name for this bird here?” 

“Lacigule,” the native an- 
swered. 

They left Big Stupe behind.
